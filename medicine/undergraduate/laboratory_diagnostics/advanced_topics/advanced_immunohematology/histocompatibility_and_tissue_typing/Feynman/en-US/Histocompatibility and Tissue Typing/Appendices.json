The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genes are clustered together on chromosome 6 and are typically inherited as a block, or haplotype.

            "problem": "A laboratory evaluates Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) compatibility among siblings by considering the transmission of intact HLA haplotypes across the classical HLA region, which is a tightly linked segment on chromosome $6$. A haplotype is the ordered set of alleles across the HLA region carried on one chromosome. Let one parent carry haplotypes denoted by $H_1$ and $H_2$, and the other parent carry haplotypes denoted by $H_3$ and $H_4$. Consider two full siblings born to these parents. Assume the HLA region transmits as intact haplotypes per meiosis, consistent with tight linkage across the region and negligible recombination within this region.\n\nUsing only core genetic principles, specifically Mendel’s First Law of Segregation (each parent transmits one of its two haplotypes with probability $1/2$) and the independence of maternal and paternal transmissions, derive the exact probabilities that the two siblings are:\n- HLA-identical (the siblings inherit the same unordered pair of parental haplotypes),\n- haploidentical (the siblings share exactly one haplotype), and\n- mismatched (the siblings share no haplotypes),\n\nunder the assumption that recombination within the HLA region is negligible.\n\nNext, introduce a recombination fraction $r$ for the HLA region, where $r$ is the probability that, in a single meiosis, the transmitted gamete harbors a recombinant haplotype within the HLA region (that is, neither $H_1$ nor $H_2$ for the first parent, and neither $H_3$ nor $H_4$ for the second parent). Starting from the definitions of $r$, independence of meioses across parents and siblings, and the requirement that HLA-identical siblings must receive the same pair of intact haplotypes, use first-principles reasoning to explain why the corrections to the three probabilities obtained under the $r=0$ assumption are of order $r$ and therefore negligible for clinical tissue typing calculations.\n\nReport your final numerical probabilities for the three outcomes in the order (HLA-identical, haploidentical, mismatched) as a single row vector.

The other parent has haplotypes $H_3$ and $H_4$.\n-   **Subjects:** Two full siblings.\n-   **Genetic Model (Part 1, no recombination):**\n    -   The HLA region transmits as an intact haplotype (negligible recombination, $r = 0$).\n    -   Mendel's First Law of Segregation: A parent transmits one of their two haplotypes with probability $1/2$.\n    -   Independence of Transmissions: Maternal and paternal transmissions are independent.\n-   **Definitions of Sibling Compatibility:**\n    -   **HLA-identical:** Siblings inherit the same unordered pair of parental haplotypes.\n    -   **Haploidentical:** Siblings share exactly one haplotype.\n    -   **Mismatched:** Siblings share no haplotypes.\n-   **Task 1:** Derive the exact probabilities for these three outcomes assuming negligible recombination.\n-   **Genetic Model (Part 2, with recombination):**\n    -   A recombination fraction $r$ is introduced, defined as the probability that a gamete harbors a recombinant haplotype from the HLA region in a single meiosis.\n-   **Task 2:** Explain why corrections to the probabilities from Part 1 are of order $r$ and thus negligible for clinical calculations. This explanation must start from first principles.\n-   **Final Answer Requirement:** Report the numerical probabilities for (HLA-identical, haploidentical, mismatched) as a single row vector of reduced fractions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental and well-established principles of Mendelian genetics and immunogenetics, specifically the inheritance of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex. The concepts of haplotypes, linkage, segregation, and recombination are central to this field. The model is a standard and scientifically sound representation used for teaching and clinical prediction. (Criterion fulfilled)\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary assumptions (Mendelian segregation, independence, negligible recombination) and precise definitions for the outcomes to be calculated (HLA-identical, haploidentical, mismatched). The request is for a derivation of specific probabilities, which allows for a unique solution. (Criterion fulfilled)\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology. (Criterion fulfilled)\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It is standard in such problems to assume the four parental haplotypes ($H_1, H_2, H_3, H_4$) are distinct; this interpretation allows for the general case to be solved and does not constitute adding missing information but rather a standard reading of the problem's intent. The problem setup is internally consistent. (Criterion fulfilled)\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The assumption of negligible recombination within the classical HLA region is a valid and common approximation, as the region exhibits strong linkage disequilibrium, meaning the recombination fraction $r$ is very small (typically $r \\approx 0.01$). (Criterion fulfilled)\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThis solution is presented in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Probabilities with Negligible Recombination ($r = 0$)**\n\nLet the parents be Parent $P_A$ with haplotypes $\\{H_1, H_2\\}$ and Parent $P_B$ with haplotypes $\\{H_3, H_4\\}$. We assume the four haplotypes are distinct.\n\nAccording to Mendel's Law of Segregation, during meiosis, each parent transmits one of their two haplotypes to an offspring with equal probability.\n-   $P_A$ transmits $H_1$ with probability $1/2$ and $H_2$ with probability $1/2$.\n-   $P_B$ transmits $H_3$ with probability $1/2$ and $H_4$ with probability $1/2$.\n\nSince the maternal and paternal transmissions are independent, we can determine the possible genotypes for any child. The genotype is the unordered pair of haplotypes inherited. The four possible genotypes are:\n1.  $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$, with probability $P(H_1) \\times P(H_3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n2.  $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$, with probability $P(H_1) \\times P(H_4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n3.  $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$, with probability $P(H_2) \\times P(H_3) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n4.  $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$, with probability $P(H_2) \\times P(H_4) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nLet Sibling 1 ($S_1$) and Sibling 2 ($S_2$) be the two children. The genotype of $S_1$ is independent of the genotype of $S_2$. There are $4 \\times 4 = 16$ equally likely pairs of genotypes for the pair $(S_1, S_2)$, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$. We can now calculate the required probabilities by counting the favorable outcomes.\n\n-   **HLA-identical (sharing 2 haplotypes):** This occurs if $S_1$ and $S_2$ have the exact same genotype. This corresponds to the cases where the genotype of $S_1$ is the same as the genotype of $S_2$. There are $4$ such cases on the diagonal of our $4 \\times 4$ possibility space: $(\\{H_1, H_3\\}, \\{H_1, H_3\\})$, $(\\{H_1, H_4\\}, \\{H_1, H_4\\})$, etc.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these $4$ outcomes:\n    $$P(\\text{identical}) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n-   **Mismatched (sharing 0 haplotypes):** This occurs if the set of haplotypes for $S_1$ is disjoint from the set for $S_2$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$. This pair of outcomes has probability $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_2, H_3\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_1, H_4\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    -   If $S_1$ has genotype $\\{H_2, H_4\\}$, $S_2$ must have genotype $\\{H_1, H_3\\}$. Probability is $\\frac{1}{16}$.\n    The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of these $4$ outcomes:\n    $$P(\\text{mismatched}) = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n-   **Haploidentical (sharing 1 haplotype):** This is the only remaining possibility. The sum of probabilities for all outcomes must be $1$.\n    $$P(\\text{haploidentical}) = 1 - P(\\text{identical}) - P(\\text{mismatched})$$\n    $$P(\\text{haploidentical}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    Alternatively, there are $16$ total outcomes. We found $4$ are identical and $4$ are mismatched. The remaining $16 - 4 - 4 = 8$ outcomes must be haploidentical. The probability is therefore $\\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Recombination ($r > 0$)**\n\nLet $r$ be the recombination fraction for the HLA region per meiosis. The probability of transmitting an intact, non-recombinant haplotype is $(1-r)$. The probability of transmitting a recombinant haplotype is $r$. Since there are two parental haplotypes, the probability of transmitting a specific intact haplotype (e.g., $H_1$) is $\\frac{1-r}{2}$.\n\nThe classical probabilities of $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, $\\frac{1}{4}$ are conditional on four successful transmissions of intact parental haplotypes—one from each parent to each of the two siblings. Let us examine the validity of this condition.\n\n1.  Each sibling's genotype is the result of two meiotic events (one maternal, one paternal). For two siblings, a total of four meiotic events are involved.\n2.  The probability of a single meiotic event producing a non-recombinant gamete is $(1-r)$.\n3.  The probability of all four independent meiotic events producing non-recombinant gametes is $(1-r)^4$.\n4.  The probability of at least one recombination event occurring across these four meioses is $P(\\text{at least one recombo}) = 1 - (1-r)^4$.\n5.  Using the binomial expansion for $(1-r)^4 = 1 - 4r + 6r^2 - 4r^3 + r^4$, we find:\n    $$P(\\text{at least one recombo}) = 1 - (1 - 4r + 6r^2 - \\dots) = 4r - 6r^2 + \\dots$$\n6.  For small $r$ (as is the case for the HLA region), the higher-order terms $O(r^2)$ are negligible compared to the first-order term. Thus, the probability of having at least one recombination event is approximately $4r$. This is a probability of order $r$.\n\nAny deviation, or \"correction,\" to the classical probabilities derived in Part 1 must arise from these scenarios where one or more recombination events occur. Since the total probability of such scenarios is of order $r$, the net change to the probabilities of the three outcomes must also be of order $r$.\n\nTo be more specific, let's analyze the probability of being HLA-identical. The problem defines this state as the siblings \"must receive the same pair of intact haplotypes.\" This definition implies that for two siblings to be HLA-identical, all four haplotypes transmitted to them must be of the intact parental type.\n-   The probability that all four transmitted haplotypes are intact is, as derived, $(1-r)^4$.\n-   *Given* that all four are intact, the probabilities revert to the classical case calculated in Part 1. The conditional probability of being identical is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Therefore, the total probability of being HLA-identical with non-zero recombination is:\n    $$P(\\text{identical}, r>0) = P(\\text{identical}|r=0) \\times P(\\text{all 4 non-recombinant})$$\n    $$P(\\text{identical}, r>0) = \\frac{1}{4} (1-r)^4 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 - 4r + O(r^2)) = \\frac{1}{4} - r + O(r^2)$$\nThe correction to the classical probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $\\Delta P_{id} = -r + O(r^2)$, which is a term of order $r$.\n\nSince the sum of the probabilities must always be $1$, i.e., $P_{id}(r) + P_{hap}(r) + P_{mis}(r) = 1$, the sum of the corrections must be zero: $\\Delta P_{id} + \\Delta P_{hap} + \\Delta P_{mis} = 0$. As $\\Delta P_{id}$ is of order $r$, the sum $\\Delta P_{hap} + \\Delta P_{mis}$ must also be of order $r$, implying that the corrections to the other probabilities are also generally of order $r$. For a physically small region like HLA, $r$ is very small (e.g., $r < 0.01$), making corrections of this order negligible for most clinical purposes and justifying the use of the simple $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}$ fractions.\n\nThe final answer requires the probabilities for the case with negligible recombination ($r=0$).\n\nProbabilities for (HLA-identical, haploidentical, mismatched): $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of immunology and probability theory, is well-posed with all necessary data and a clear objective, and is expressed in objective language. The simplifying assumption of independence is explicitly stated, making the problem self-contained and solvable.\n\nThe problem asks for the Calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (CPRA), which is defined as the probability that a randomly selected donor possesses at least one antigen from the candidate’s list of unacceptable antigens. Let the unacceptable antigens be denoted by $U_1 = \\mathrm{HLA-A2}$, $U_2 = \\mathrm{HLA-B7}$, and $U_3 = \\mathrm{HLA-DR17}$.\n\nLet $A_1$ be the event that a randomly selected donor possesses antigen $U_1$.\nLet $A_2$ be the event that a randomly selected donor possesses antigen $U_2$.\nLet $A_3$ be the event that a randomly selected donor possesses antigen $U_3$.\n\nThe given antigen frequencies are interpreted as probabilities:\n$P(A_1) = f(\\mathrm{A2}) = 0.48$\n$P(A_2) = f(\\mathrm{B7}) = 0.16$\n$P(A_3) = f(\\mathrm{DR17}) = 0.12$\n\nThe CPRA is the probability of the union of these events, which corresponds to the donor having at least one of the unacceptable antigens:\n$$CPRA = P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3)$$\n\nThe problem suggests using the complement rule. The complement of the event \"at least one unacceptable antigen is present\" is the event \"none of the unacceptable antigens are present\". Let $E = A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3$. The complement event is $E^c$. By the rule of complements, the probability of $E$ is:\n$$P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$$\n\nUsing De Morgan's laws, the complement of a union is the intersection of the complements:\n$$E^c = (A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup A_3)^c = A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c$$\nHere, $A_i^c$ is the event that the donor does *not* possess antigen $U_i$. The probability of this complement event is:\n$$P(E^c) = P(A_1^c \\cap A_2^c \\cap A_3^c)$$\n\nThe problem states that the presence of these antigens are independent events. If events $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are independent, then their complements $A_1^c$, $A_2^c$, and $A_3^c$ are also independent. Therefore, the probability of the intersection is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(E^c) = P(A_1^c) \\times P(A_2^c) \\times P(A_3^c)$$\n\nThe probability of each complement event $A_i^c$ is given by $P(A_i^c) = 1 - P(A_i)$. Substituting these into the equation for $P(E^c)$:\n$$P(E^c) = (1 - P(A_1)) \\times (1 - P(A_2)) \\times (1 - P(A_3))$$\nThis term represents the probability that a donor is compatible (i.e., has none of the unacceptable antigens).\n\nFinally, substituting this back into the expression for CPRA:\n$$CPRA = 1 - P(E^c) = 1 - \\bigl( (1 - P(A_1)) \\times (1 - P(A_2)) \\times (1 - P(A_3)) \\bigr)$$\n\nIn terms of the given antigen frequencies:\n$$CPRA = 1 - \\bigl( (1 - f(\\mathrm{A2})) \\times (1 - f(\\mathrm{B7})) \\times (1 - f(\\mathrm{DR17})) \\bigr)$$\nThis is the derived expression for CPRA under the assumption of independence.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given frequencies:\n$f(\\mathrm{A2}) = 0.48$\n$f(\\mathrm{B7}) = 0.16$\n$f(\\mathrm{DR17}) = 0.12$\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities of not having each antigen:\n$1 - f(\\mathrm{A2}) = 1 - 0.48 = 0.52$\n$1 - f(\\mathrm{B7}) = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84$\n$1 - f(\\mathrm{DR17}) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$\n\nNext, calculate the probability of being compatible (not having any of the three antigens):\n$$P(\\text{compatible}) = (0.52) \\times (0.84) \\times (0.88)$$\n$$P(\\text{compatible}) = 0.4368 \\times 0.88$$\n$$P(\\text{compatible}) = 0.384384$$\n\nFinally, calculate the CPRA:\n$$CPRA = 1 - P(\\text{compatible})$$\n$$CPRA = 1 - 0.384384$$\n$$CPRA = 0.615616$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "A renal transplant candidate undergoes a pre-transplant crossmatch using the Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) method with donor T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes. The CDC assay is based on complement activation: if recipient serum contains cytotoxic antibodies that bind to donor lymphocytes, the classical complement pathway is initiated, culminating in membrane attack complex formation and cell lysis. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is highly efficient at activating the classical pathway due to its pentameric structure, while Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses vary in their ability to fix complement. The standard clinical concern is donor-specific anti-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) IgG, not IgM. The following results are obtained:\n\n- T-cell CDC crossmatch: negative at neat serum and at serial dilutions of $1{:}2$ and $1{:}4$.\n- B-cell CDC crossmatch: $50\\%$ lysis at neat serum, $30\\%$ at $1{:}2$, and $0\\%$ at $1{:}4$.\n- Anti-human globulin-augmented CDC (AHG-CDC): T-cell negative; B-cell positive at neat and $1{:}2$.\n- Flow cytometric crossmatch (FCXM) detecting IgG binding: T-cell negative; B-cell negative.\n- Luminex single-antigen bead (SAB) assay for anti-HLA IgG donor-specific antibodies: negative.\n- Autologous CDC crossmatch (recipient serum tested against recipient’s own lymphocytes): B-cell weakly positive ($\\approx 20\\%$ lysis), T-cell negative.\n- After treating the recipient serum with dithiothreitol (DTT) to reduce disulfide bonds in pentameric IgM, the B-cell CDC crossmatch becomes negative at all dilutions.\n- The recipient serum reacts strongly in CDC against a panel of unrelated Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, but shows no reactivity against freshly isolated B cells from unrelated healthy donors.\n\nStarting from the fundamental immunologic bases of the CDC assay (classical complement activation by bound antibody, structural features and complement-fixing capacity of IgM versus IgG, and the expression of class I and class II HLA on T and B lymphocytes), identify the most likely mechanistic causes of the initial B-cell CDC positivity and select the most appropriate confirmatory testing approach to resolve whether the finding represents clinically significant donor-specific anti-HLA IgG versus false-positive reactivity.

It presents a classic, albeit complex, case in pre-transplant histocompatibility testing, with all provided data and immunological principles being factually correct and relevant to the field of laboratory diagnostics.\n\nThe core task is to interpret a set of serological and cellular assay results to determine the nature of a positive B-cell crossmatch and decide on the appropriate clinical course of action. The analysis will proceed by systematically evaluating each piece of data based on first principles of immunology.\n\n**Fundamental Principles:**\n1.  **Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) Assay:** This assay detects complement-fixing antibodies. The classical pathway is initiated when C1q binds to the Fc portion of antibody molecules (IgM or IgG) that are bound to antigens on a cell surface. IgM, being a pentamer, is exceptionally efficient at binding C1q and activating complement, requiring only a single molecule. IgG is less efficient and typically requires multiple molecules in close proximity.\n2.  **HLA Antigen Expression:** T lymphocytes primarily express HLA class I antigens (HLA-A, -B, -C). B lymphocytes express both HLA class I and HLA class II antigens (HLA-DR, -DQ, -DP).\n3.  **Antibody Isotypes:** IgM and IgG are the main immunoglobulin classes of interest. Clinically significant donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) that mediate rejection are typically IgG. IgM antibodies against HLA are often naturally occurring, transient, or not associated with graft rejection.\n4.  **Dithiothreitol (DTT):** This reducing agent cleaves disulfide bonds, which are critical for maintaining the pentameric structure of IgM. DTT treatment effectively inactivates IgM's ability to agglutinate or fix complement, while IgG, a monomer, is largely unaffected.\n\n**Analysis of Provided Data:**\n- **T-cell CDC Crossmatch: Negative.** T cells express only HLA class I. A negative T-cell CDC indicates the absence of significant levels of complement-fixing antibodies, of either IgM or IgG isotype, directed against the donor's HLA class I antigens.\n\n- **B-cell CDC Crossmatch: Positive ($50\\%$ lysis at neat, $30\\%$ at $1{:}2$, $0\\%$ at $1{:}4$).** B cells express both HLA class I and class II. Since the T-cell crossmatch was negative, the reactivity is unlikely to be against class I antigens. This points towards antibodies against HLA class II antigens or non-HLA antigens expressed on B cells. The low titer (activity disappears by $1{:}4$ dilution) is noted.\n\n- **AHG-CDC Crossmatch: T-cell negative; B-cell positive.** Anti-human globulin (AHG) is an antibody against human immunoglobulins. It cross-links IgG antibodies bound to the cell surface, enhancing their ability to fix complement. A negative AHG-CDC T-cell result further strengthens the conclusion that no clinically relevant anti-HLA class I IgG is present. A positive AHG-CDC B-cell result could suggest low levels of non-complement-fixing IgG against B cells (e.g., anti-class II), but it does not rule out an IgM-mediated cause.\n\n- **Flow Cytometric Crossmatch (FCXM) for IgG: T-cell negative; B-cell negative.** The FCXM is a more sensitive method than CDC for detecting antibody *binding*, irrespective of complement-fixing ability. A negative IgG FCXM for both T and B cells is very strong evidence against the presence of any significant amount of donor-specific IgG antibody, for both class I and class II antigens. This finding starts to contradict the hypothesis that the positive B-cell CDC is due to anti-HLA IgG.\n\n- **Luminex Single-Antigen Bead (SAB) Assay for anti-HLA IgG DSAs: Negative.** This is the most sensitive and specific solid-phase assay for detecting and identifying anti-HLA IgG antibodies. A negative result provides the most definitive evidence available that the recipient does not have circulating donor-specific IgG antibodies against any of the donor's HLA antigens.\n\n- **Autologous CDC Crossmatch: B-cell weakly positive ($\\approx 20\\%$ lysis).** The recipient's serum reacts with their own B lymphocytes. This indicates the presence of a B-cell specific *autoantibody*. A true donor-specific antibody would not react with the recipient's own cells (unless the donor and recipient share the target antigen by chance, and the antibody is an alloantibody that cross-reacts).\n\n- **Effect of DTT Treatment: B-cell CDC becomes negative.** DTT inactivates IgM. The fact that the B-cell CDC positivity is completely abrogated by DTT treatment is conclusive proof that the antibody responsible is an IgM, not an IgG.\n\n- **Panel Reactivity: Strong CDC against EBV-transformed B-cell lines; no reactivity against fresh B cells.** This is a classic pattern for a specific type of B-cell reactive non-HLA autoantibody. These IgM autoantibodies often recognize B-cell activation antigens or other determinants that are highly expressed on cultured, virally transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines but are absent or expressed at very low levels on resting, freshly isolated B cells. They are typically considered clinically insignificant for transplantation.\n\n**Synthesis:**\nThe collective evidence overwhelmingly points to a single conclusion: the positive B-cell CDC crossmatch is a \"false positive\" in the context of predicting transplant outcome. It is caused by a low-titer, B-cell-specific IgM autoantibody that is not directed against donor HLA antigens. This is supported by: 1) DTT sensitivity (proves IgM); 2) negative IgG-specific assays (FCXM, Luminex); 3) positive auto-crossmatch (proves auto-reactivity); and 4) characteristic reactivity pattern with EBV-transformed cell lines. Such antibodies are known artifacts in CDC crossmatching and do not pose a risk for antibody-mediated rejection.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. The pattern is best explained by high-titer donor-specific anti-HLA class II IgG; confirm by repeating CDC with anti-human globulin enhancement and, if negative at higher dilution ($\\geq 1{:}8$), proceed with transplantation.**\n**Incorrect.** This explanation is contradicted by multiple pieces of evidence. The titer is low, not high. Most importantly, the most sensitive tests for anti-HLA IgG (FCXM and Luminex SAB) were negative, and the DTT treatment proved the antibody is IgM, not IgG. The proposed confirmation step is illogical.\n\n**B. The pattern is most consistent with IgM cold-reactive autoantibodies and antibodies against EBV-related B-cell antigens causing false-positive B-cell CDC; confirm by DTT treatment to abolish IgM effects, performing FCXM to detect IgG-specific binding, and comparing reactivity against EBV-transformed B-cell lines versus freshly isolated donor B cells.**\n**Correct.** This option accurately synthesizes all the data. It correctly identifies the antibody as IgM, its auto-reactive nature, and its common target on transformed B cells, all of which explain the \"false-positive\" result. The confirmatory steps listed in this option are precisely the set of tests that were performed and led to the resolution of the case. They represent the standard-of-care approach to investigate and dismiss such a finding.\n\n**C. The pattern reflects a prozone effect from extremely high-titer donor-specific IgG; confirm by testing at higher dilutions and adding ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to block complement.**\n**Incorrect.** A prozone effect would show increased reactivity at higher dilutions, whereas the observed reactivity decreases with dilution. The negative IgG-specific tests (FCXM, Luminex) rule out extremely high-titer IgG. Adding EDTA is a control to show that lysis is complement-dependent; it does not resolve a prozone phenomenon.\n\n**D. The pattern is due to anti-complementary activity in the recipient serum causing pan-reactivity; confirm by heat-inactivating recipient complement and repeating CDC with exogenous complement as the sole source.**\n**Incorrect.** Anti-complementary serum would inhibit the assay, causing a false *negative*, not a false positive. The observed reactivity is specific to B-cells, not a pan-reactive effect. The proposed confirmation is a standard control but is irrelevant to explaining a positive result of this nature.\n\n**E. The pattern is due to Fc receptor-mediated binding of circulating immune complexes to donor B cells; confirm by pronase-treating donor B cells to reduce Fc receptor expression and repeating the CDC crossmatch.**\n**Incorrect.** While Fc receptor binding is a potential artifact, it is less likely to cause a positive CDC assay than a direct IgM-mediated effect. Most crucially, the DTT treatment result points directly and definitively to an IgM-mediated mechanism. The IgM pentamer does not typically bind to classical Fc receptors for IgG (FcγR). This explanation ignores the most conclusive piece of data.",
