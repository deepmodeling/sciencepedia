The solution will proceed from first principles of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).\n\nThe data provided consists of $N=10$ observations, with $n_i = 2$ replicates at each of $c=5$ concentration levels $x_i$:\n- Level $1$: $x_1 = 0$ mg/dL; $y_{11} = 9.7$, $y_{12} = 10.3$.\n- Level $2$: $x_2 = 50$ mg/dL; $y_{21} = 52.3$, $y_{22} = 52.7$.\n- Level $3$: $x_3 = 100$ mg/dL; $y_{31} = 99.6$, $y_{32} = 100.4$.\n- Level $4$: $x_4 = 150$ mg/dL; $y_{41} = 152.3$, $y_{42} = 152.7$.\n- Level $5$: $x_5 = 200$ mg/dL; $y_{51} = 209.7$, $y_{52} = 210.3$.\n\nThe test for curvature is specified as a test of the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$ by comparing the reduced model (linear) to the full model (quadratic). This is a partial F-test in the context of multiple regression. The test statistic $F$ is given by:\n$$F = \\frac{(SS_{E, \\text{reduced}} - SS_{E, \\text{full}}) / (p_{\\text{full}} - p_{\\text{reduced}})}{SS_{E, \\text{full}} / (N - p_{\\text{full}})}$$\nwhere:\n- $SS_{E, \\text{reduced}}$ is the residual sum of squares for the reduced linear model, $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$.\n- $SS_{E, \\text{full}}$ is the residual sum of squares for the full quadratic model, $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2$.\n- $p_{\\text{reduced}}$ is the number of parameters in the reduced model ($p_{\\text{reduced}} = 2$).\n- $p_{\\text{full}}$ is the number of parameters in the full model ($p_{\\text{full}} = 3$).\n- $N$ is the total number of observations ($N=10$).\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the numerator are $df_{num} = p_{\\text{full}} - p_{\\text{reduced}} = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the denominator are $df_{den} = N - p_{\\text{full}} = 10 - 3 = 7$.\n\nOur task is to compute $SS_{E, \\text{reduced}}$ and $SS_{E, \\text{full}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary summary statistics from the data:\n$N=10$\n$\\sum x_i = 2(0+50+100+150+200) = 1000$\n$\\bar{x} = 1000/10 = 100$\n$\\sum y_i = (9.7+10.3) + (52.3+52.7) + (99.6+100.4) + (152.3+152.7) + (209.7+210.3) = 20+105+200+305+420 = 1050$\n$\\bar{y} = 1050/10 = 105$\n$\\sum x_i^2 = 2(0^2+50^2+100^2+150^2+200^2) = 2(75000) = 150000$\n$\\sum x_i y_i = 0(20) + 50(105) + 100(200) + 150(305) + 200(420) = 5250 + 20000 + 45750 + 84000 = 155000$\n$\\sum y_i^2 = 9.7^2 + 10.3^2 + \\dots + 210.3^2 = 160425.84$\n\n**1. Reduced Model: Linear Regression ($y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x$)**\n\nThe OLS estimators for the linear model coefficients are:\n$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})(y_i-\\bar{y})}{\\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i - N\\bar{x}\\bar{y}}{\\sum x_i^2 - N\\bar{x}^2}$\n$\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{155000 - 10(100)(105)}{150000 - 10(100)^2} = \\frac{155000 - 105000}{150000 - 100000} = \\frac{50000}{50000} = 1$\n$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\beta}_1\\bar{x} = 105 - (1)(100) = 5$\nThe fitted linear model is $\\hat{y} = 5 + x$.\n\nThe residual sum of squares for the linear model, $SS_{E, \\text{reduced}}$, is:\n$SS_{E, \\text{reduced}} = \\sum(y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2 = \\sum(y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x_i))^2$\n$SS_{E, \\text{reduced}} = \\sum y_i^2 - \\hat{\\beta}_0 \\sum y_i - \\hat{\\beta}_1 \\sum x_i y_i$\n$SS_{E, \\text{reduced}} = 160425.84 - (5)(1050) - (1)(155000) = 160425.84 - 5250 - 155000 = 175.84$.\n\n**2. Full Model: Quadratic Regression ($y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2$)**\n\nTo simplify the calculation of the OLS estimators, we center the predictor variable: $u = x - \\bar{x} = x - 100$. The model becomes $y = \\beta_0^* + \\beta_1^* u + \\beta_2^* u^2$. The normal equations are $(U^T U)\\beta^* = U^T y$. We compute the elements of these matrices:\n$\\sum u_i = 0$\n$\\sum u_i^2 = \\sum(x_i-\\bar{x})^2 = 50000$\n$\\sum u_i^3 = 0$ (due to symmetry of $x$ values around $\\bar{x}$)\n$\\sum u_i^4 = \\sum(x_i-100)^4 = 2[(-100)^4 + (-50)^4 + 0^4 + 50^4 + 100^4] = 2(10^8 + 6.25 \\times 10^6) \\times 2 = 4(10^8 + 6.25 \\times 10^6) = 4.25 \\times 10^8$\n$\\sum u_i y_i = \\sum(x_i-100)y_i = \\sum x_i y_i - 100 \\sum y_i = 155000 - 100(1050) = 50000$\n$\\sum u_i^2 y_i = \\sum(x_i-100)^2 y_i = 10000(20) + 2500(105) + 0(200) + 2500(305) + 10000(420) = 200000 + 262500 + 0 + 762500 + 4200000 = 5425000$\n\nThe normal equations system is:\n$U^T U \\hat{\\beta}^* = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 & 0 & 50000 \\\\ 0 & 50000 & 0 \\\\ 50000 & 0 & 4.25 \\times 10^8 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{\\beta}_0^* \\\\ \\hat{\\beta}_1^* \\\\ \\hat{\\beta}_2^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1050 \\\\ 50000 \\\\ 5425000 \\end{pmatrix} = U^T y$\n\nFrom the second row: $50000 \\hat{\\beta}_1^* = 50000 \\implies \\hat{\\beta}_1^* = 1$.\nThe first and third rows form a system for $\\hat{\\beta}_0^*$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_2^*$:\n1. $10 \\hat{\\beta}_0^* + 50000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 1050 \\implies \\hat{\\beta}_0^* = 105 - 5000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^*$\n2. $50000 \\hat{\\beta}_0^* + 425000000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 5425000$\n\nSubstituting (1) into (2):\n$50000(105 - 5000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^*) + 425000000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 5425000$\n$5250000 - 250000000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* + 425000000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 5425000$\n$175000000 \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 175000 \\implies \\hat{\\beta}_2^* = 0.001$\nThen, $\\hat{\\beta}_0^* = 105 - 5000(0.001) = 105 - 5 = 100$.\n\nThe residual sum of squares for the quadratic model, $SS_{E, \\text{full}}$, is:\n$SS_{E, \\text{full}} = \\sum y_i^2 - {\\hat{\\beta}^*}^T U^T y = \\sum y_i^2 - (\\hat{\\beta}_0^* \\sum y_i + \\hat{\\beta}_1^* \\sum u_i y_i + \\hat{\\beta}_2^* \\sum u_i^2 y_i )$\n$SS_{E, \\text{full}} = 160425.84 - [100(1050) + 1(50000) + 0.001(5425000)]$\n$SS_{E, \\text{full}} = 160425.84 - [105000 + 50000 + 5425] = 160425.84 - 160425 = 0.84$.\n\n**3. Compute the F-statistic**\n\nNow we substitute the SSE values into the F-statistic formula:\n$SS_{E, \\text{reduced}} = 175.84$\n$SS_{E, \\text{full}} = 0.84$\n$df_{num} = 1$\n$df_{den} = 7$\n\n$F = \\frac{(175.84 - 0.84) / 1}{0.84 / 7} = \\frac{175}{0.12}$\n$F = 1458.333...$\n\nRounding the answer to $4$ significant figures gives $1458$.\n\nThis F-statistic tests the significance of the reduction in residual error achieved by adding the quadratic term to the linear model. The large value of $F$ indicates that the quadratic term is highly significant, and that there is substantial evidence of curvature.",
