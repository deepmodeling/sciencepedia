Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe provided counts are:\n-   True Positives ($TP$): The number of subjects with the disease who test positive, $N(D^+ \\cap T^+) = 120$.\n-   False Positives ($FP$): The number of subjects without the disease who test positive, $N(D^- \\cap T^+) = 30$.\n-   False Negatives ($FN$): The number of subjects with the disease who test negative, $N(D^+ \\cap T^-) = 20$.\n-   True Negatives ($TN$): The number of subjects without the disease who test negative, $N(D^- \\cap T^-) = 330$.\n\nFrom these counts, we can determine the marginal totals:\n-   Total number of subjects with the disease: $N(D^+) = TP + FN = 120 + 20 = 140$.\n-   Total number of subjects without the disease: $N(D^-) = FP + TN = 30 + 330 = 360$.\n-   Total number of subjects with a positive test: $N(T^+) = TP + FP = 120 + 30 = 150$.\n-   Total number of subjects with a negative test: $N(T^-) = FN + TN = 20 + 330 = 350$.\n-   Total number of subjects in the cohort: $N = TP + FP + FN + TN = 120 + 30 + 20 + 330 = 500$.\n\nThe task is to derive estimators for five diagnostic accuracy metrics from the core definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, where probabilities are estimated by sample frequencies, i.e., $P(E) \\approx \\frac{N(E)}{N}$.\n\n**1. Sensitivity ($Sens$)**\nSensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has the disease. It is defined as the conditional probability $P(T^+|D^+)$.\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$Sens = P(T^+ | D^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\cap D^+)}{P(D^+)}$$\nThe estimator, $\\widehat{Sens}$, is found by substituting the sample frequencies (counts):\n$$\\widehat{Sens} = \\frac{N(T^+ \\cap D^+)}{N(D^+)} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\\widehat{Sens} = \\frac{120}{120 + 20} = \\frac{120}{140} = \\frac{6}{7} \\approx 0.8571$$\n\n**2. Specificity ($Spec$)**\nSpecificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have the disease. It is defined as the conditional probability $P(T^-|D^-)$.\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$Spec = P(T^- | D^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\cap D^-)}{P(D^-)}$$\nThe estimator, $\\widehat{Spec}$, is:\n$$\\widehat{Spec} = \\frac{N(T^- \\cap D^-)}{N(D^-)} = \\frac{TN}{FP + TN}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\\widehat{Spec} = \\frac{330}{30 + 330} = \\frac{330}{360} = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.9167$$\n\n**3. Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)**\nPositive predictive value is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result. It is defined as the conditional probability $P(D^+|T^+)$.\nStarting from the definition of conditional probability:\n$$PPV = P(D^+ | T^+) = \\frac{P(D^+ \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe estimator, $\\widehat{PPV}$, is:\n$$\\widehat{PPV} = \\frac{N(D^+ \\cap T^+)}{N(T^+)} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\\widehat{PPV} = \\frac{120}{120 + 30} = \\frac{120}{150} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$\n\n**4.

Diagnostic Odds Ratio ($DOR$)**\nThe diagnostic odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of testing positive if the patient has the disease to the odds of testing positive if the patient does not have the disease.\nThe odds of an event $A$ is defined as $\\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}$.\nThe odds of a positive test in the diseased group is:\n$$\\text{Odds}(T^+|D^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+)}{P(T^-|D^+)} = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+)}{1 - P(T^+|D^+)} = \\frac{Sens}{1-Sens}$$\nThe odds of a positive test in the non-diseased group is:\n$$\\text{Odds}(T^+|D^-) = \\frac{P(T^+|D^-)}{P(T^-|D^-)} = \\frac{1 - P(T^-|D^-)}{P(T^-|D^-)} = \\frac{1-Spec}{Spec}$$\nThe $DOR$ is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$DOR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(T^+|D^+)}{\\text{Odds}(T^+|D^-)} = \\frac{Sens / (1-Sens)}{(1-Spec) / Spec}$$\nNow, we substitute the estimators derived from the counts:\n$\\widehat{Sens} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$, so $1-\\widehat{Sens} = \\frac{FN}{TP+FN}$.\n$\\widehat{Spec} = \\frac{TN}{FP+TN}$, so $1-\\widehat{Spec} = \\frac{FP}{FP+TN}$.\nThe estimator for the odds in the diseased group is:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Odds}}(T^+|D^+) = \\frac{TP/(TP+FN)}{FN/(TP+FN)} = \\frac{TP}{FN}$$\nThe estimator for the odds in the non-diseased group is:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Odds}}(T^+|D^-) = \\frac{FP/(FP+TN)}{TN/(FP+TN)} = \\frac{FP}{TN}$$\nTherefore, the estimator for the $DOR$ is the ratio of these two estimated odds, which simplifies to the cross-product ratio:\n$$\\widehat{DOR} = \\frac{TP/FN}{FP/TN} = \\frac{TP \\times TN}{FP \\times FN}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$\\widehat{DOR} = \\frac{120 \\times 330}{30 \\times 20} = \\frac{39600}{600} = \\frac{396}{6} = 66$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is an exact integer, $66$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $66.00$.",

Using first principles from Bayesian reasoning in diagnostic testing, begin with the definition of conditional probability and Bayes theorem, and the definitions of likelihood ratios in terms of conditional probabilities. From these foundations, derive how to update from pretest probability to post-test probability after a positive result and after a negative result. Then, using the given values, compute the numerical post-test probabilities for a positive result and for a negative result.

Let $T+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result. The provided information is:\n- Pretest probability of disease: $P(D) = 0.20$.\n- Positive likelihood ratio: $LR_{+} = 8$.\n- Negative likelihood ratio: $LR_{-} = 0.2$.\n\nOur objective is to derive the post-test probabilities of disease given a positive result, $P(D|T+)$, and given a negative result, $P(D|T-)$, starting from first principles.\n\n**1. First Principles and Definitions**\n\nThe definition of conditional probability for two events $A$ and $B$, where $P(B) > 0$, is:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nFrom this, we can write $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$. By symmetry, $P(B \\cap A) = P(B|A)P(A)$. Since $P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\cap A)$, we can equate these to get $P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)$. Rearranging for $P(A|B)$ yields Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n\nThe likelihood ratios are defined in terms of conditional probabilities. The positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$, is the ratio of the true positive rate (sensitivity) to the false positive rate.\n$$LR_{+} = \\frac{P(T+|D)}{P(T+|D^c)}$$\nThe negative likelihood ratio, $LR_{-}$, is the ratio of the false negative rate to the true negative rate (specificity).\n$$LR_{-} = \\frac{P(T-|D)}{P(T-|D^c)}$$\n\n**2. Derivation using the Odds Formulation**\n\nTo update from pretest to post-test probability, it is convenient to work with odds. The odds of an event $A$ are defined as $O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1-P(A)} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)}$.\n\nThe pretest odds of disease are:\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}$$\nThe post-test odds of disease, given a positive result $T+$, are:\n$$O_{post,+} = \\frac{P(D|T+)}{P(D^c|T+)}$$\nUsing Bayes' theorem for the numerator and denominator:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\n$$P(D^c|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T+)}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $O_{post,+}$:\n$$O_{post,+} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+)}}{\\frac{P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T+)}} = \\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)}$$\nThis can be rearranged into two parts:\n$$O_{post,+} = \\left(\\frac{P(T+|D)}{P(T+|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right)$$\nWe recognize the first term as the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{+}$, and the second term as the pretest odds, $O_{pre}$. Thus, we have derived the fundamental relationship for a positive test:\n$$O_{post,+} = LR_{+} \\times O_{pre}$$\nAn analogous derivation for a negative test result $T-$ yields:\n$$O_{post,-} = \\frac{P(D|T-)}{P(D^c|T-)} = \\left(\\frac{P(T-|D)}{P(T-|D^c)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right) = LR_{-} \\times O_{pre}$$\n\nFinally, to convert odds back to probability, we use the relationship $P(A) = \\frac{O(A)}{1+O(A)}$.\nTherefore, the post-test probabilities are:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{O_{post,+}}{1 + O_{post,+}}$$\n$$P(D|T-) = \\frac{O_{post,-}}{1 + O_{post,-}}$$\n\n**3. Numerical Computation**\n\nGiven the values: $P(D) = 0.20$, $LR_{+} = 8$, and $LR_{-} = 0.2$.\n\nFirst, calculate the pretest odds. The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n$$O_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25$$\n\nNext, calculate the post-test odds for a positive result:\n$$O_{post,+} = LR_{+} \\times O_{pre} = 8 \\times 0.25 = 2.0$$\nConvert these odds back to a probability:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{O_{post,+}}{1 + O_{post,+}} = \\frac{2.0}{1 + 2.0} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P(D|T+) \\approx 0.6667$.\n\nNow, calculate the post-test odds for a negative result:\n$$O_{post,-} = LR_{-} \\times O_{pre} = 0.2 \\times 0.25 = 0.05$$\nConvert these odds back to a probability:\n$$P(D|T-) = \\frac{O_{post,-}}{1 + O_{post,-}} = \\frac{0.05}{1 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{1.05} = \\frac{5}{105} = \\frac{1}{21} \\approx 0.047619...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P(D|T-) \\approx 0.04762$.\n\nThe post-test probability of disease after a positive result is $0.6667$, and after a negative result it is $0.04762$.",

The derivation must start from three foundational principles.\n\nLet the two serial measurements of the analyte be represented by the random variables $M_1$ and $M_2$. We are interested in the statistical significance of the difference $D = M_2 - M_1$.\n\n**Foundation 1: Variance of Independent Random Variables**\nEach measurement $M$ is subject to two independent sources of random variation: analytical imprecision (variation in the measurement process) and within-subject biological variation (fluctuation around the patient's homeostatic set-point). Let the variance due to analytical imprecision be $\\sigma^2_A$ and the variance due to within-subject biological fluctuation be $\\sigma^2_I$. The total variance of a single measurement, $\\sigma^2_M$, is the sum of these independent component variances:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_M = \\sigma^2_A + \\sigma^2_I\n$$\nThe problem states that the two serial measurements, $M_1$ and $M_2$, are independent. The variance of the difference, $\\sigma^2_D = \\text{Var}(M_2 - M_1)$, is the sum of the variances of $M_1$ and $M_2$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_D = \\text{Var}(M_2) + \\text{Var}(M_1)\n$$\nAssuming the patient is stable, the total variance for each measurement is the same.

This can be rearranged to express the variance as $\\sigma^2 = (\\text{CV} \\times \\mu)^2 = \\text{CV}^2 \\mu^2$.\nLet the patient's homeostatic set-point be $S_p$, which serves as the mean ($\\mu$) for the variations.
