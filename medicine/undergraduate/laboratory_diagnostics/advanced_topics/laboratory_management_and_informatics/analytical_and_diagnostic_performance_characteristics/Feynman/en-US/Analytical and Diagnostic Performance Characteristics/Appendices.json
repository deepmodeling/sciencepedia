            "problem": "An immunoassay exhibits proportional imprecision due to multiplicative sources of error (for example, pipetting volumes that scale with the analyte amount). Assume replicate measurements at three target concentrations are obtained under stable conditions. You are given eight within-run replicates at each concentration of analyte mass concentration in nanograms per milliliter, denoted $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$: low target around $2.0$ $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, medium around $20.0$ $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, and high around $200.0$ $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$. The observed values are:\n- Low: $1.92$, $1.98$, $2.05$, $2.10$, $1.95$, $2.02$, $2.08$, $1.99$.\n- Medium: $19.1$, $20.5$, $21.2$, $19.8$, $20.1$, $20.8$, $19.6$, $21.0$.\n- High: $193$, $205$, $212$, $198$, $201$, $208$, $196$, $210$.\n\nStarting from first principles about variance under multiplicative error structures and the definition of relative dispersion, justify why a dimensionless dispersion metric based on the ratio of a scale parameter to location is appropriate for assessing imprecision when error scales with concentration. Then, using the replicates above, compute this metric, the Coefficient of Variation (CV), for each concentration stratum. Finally, to summarize heteroscedasticity on the raw scale, compute the heteroscedasticity index $H$ defined as the ratio of the CV at high concentration to the CV at low concentration, $H = \\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{high}} / \\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{low}}$. Round your final value of $H$ to three significant figures and report it as a decimal without a percentage sign and without units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a justification for using the Coefficient of Variation (CV) to assess imprecision in a system with multiplicative error, followed by the calculation of specific CVs and a heteroscedasticity index $H$.\n\nFirst, we address the theoretical justification. A proportional or multiplicative error structure implies that the magnitude of the measurement error is proportional to the true value of the quantity being measured. Let the true analyte concentration be $\\mu$. A single measurement, $X$, can be modeled as:\n$$X = \\mu \\cdot \\epsilon$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless random error term. For the measurement to be unbiased, the expected value of the error term must be $1$, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = 1$. The variability of the error term is captured by its variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2$. We assume that this error term $\\epsilon$ is independent of the true concentration $\\mu$.\n\nFrom this model, we can derive the expected value and variance of the measurement $X$. The expected value (a measure of location) is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu \\cdot \\epsilon] = \\mu \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon] = \\mu \\cdot 1 = \\mu$$\nThe variance of the measurement (the square of a measure of scale) is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mu \\cdot \\epsilon) = \\mu^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\mu^2 \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2$$\nThe standard deviation ($\\mathrm{SD}$) of the measurement is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\mathrm{SD}(X) = \\sqrt{\\mu^2 \\sigma_{\\epsilon}^2} = |\\mu| \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$$\nSince concentration $\\mu$ must be non-negative, this simplifies to $\\mathrm{SD}(X) = \\mu \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThis result shows that the standard deviation of the measurements is directly proportional to the mean concentration $\\mu$. In such cases of heteroscedasticity (error changing with magnitude), the standard deviation itself is not a good metric for comparing imprecision across different concentration levels. A dimensionless metric is required. The Coefficient of Variation ($\\mathrm{CV}$) is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SD}(X)}{\\mathbb{E}[X]}$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for the multiplicative error model:\n$$\\mathrm{CV} = \\frac{\\mu \\sigma_{\\epsilon}}{\\mu} = \\sigma_{\\epsilon}$$\nThis demonstrates that for a pure multiplicative error structure, the $\\mathrm{CV}$ is constant across all concentration levels and is equal to the standard deviation of the underlying multiplicative error term, $\\sigma_{\\epsilon}$. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{CV}$, which is a ratio of a scale parameter ($\\mathrm{SD}$) to a location parameter (mean), is the appropriate dimensionless metric for characterizing imprecision because it remains stable across the measurement range.\n\nNext, we compute the required sample statistics from the provided data. The sample mean ($\\bar{x}$) and sample standard deviation ($s$) for a set of $n$ measurements $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n\\}$ are given by:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\nThe sample Coefficient of Variation is then $\\mathrm{CV} = s / \\bar{x}$.\n\nFor the low concentration stratum, the data are: $1.92, 1.98, 2.05, 2.10, 1.95, 2.02, 2.08, 1.99$. The number of replicates is $n_L = 8$.\nThe sum of the values is $\\sum x_{i,L} = 16.09$.\nThe sample mean is $\\bar{x}_L = \\frac{16.09}{8} = 2.01125 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\nThe sum of squared differences is $\\sum (x_{i,L} - \\bar{x}_L)^2 = 0.0276875$.\nThe sample variance is $s_L^2 = \\frac{0.0276875}{8-1} = \\frac{0.0276875}{7} \\approx 0.003955357$.\nThe sample standard deviation is $s_L = \\sqrt{0.003955357} \\approx 0.06289163 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\nThe Coefficient of Variation for the low stratum is:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{low}} = \\frac{s_L}{\\bar{x}_L} = \\frac{0.06289163}{2.01125} \\approx 0.0312690$$\n\nFor the high concentration stratum, the data are: $193, 205, 212, 198, 201, 208, 196, 210$. The number of replicates is $n_H = 8$.\nThe sum of the values is $\\sum x_{i,H} = 1623$.\nThe sample mean is $\\bar{x}_H = \\frac{1623}{8} = 202.875 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\nThe sum of squared differences is $\\sum (x_{i,H} - \\bar{x}_H)^2 = 336.875$.\nThe sample variance is $s_H^2 = \\frac{336.875}{8-1} = \\frac{336.875}{7} = 48.125$.\nThe sample standard deviation is $s_H = \\sqrt{48.125} \\approx 6.9372188 \\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$.\nThe Coefficient of Variation for the high stratum is:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{high}} = \\frac{s_H}{\\bar{x}_H} = \\frac{6.9372188}{202.875} \\approx 0.0341950$$\n\nFinally, we compute the heteroscedasticity index $H$, defined as the ratio of the CV at high concentration to the CV at low concentration.\n$$H = \\frac{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{high}}}{\\mathrm{CV}_{\\text{low}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$H = \\frac{0.0341950}{0.0312690} \\approx 1.093574$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final value of $H$ to three significant figures.

            "problem": "A new enzymatic assay for a serum analyte was evaluated against a reference method by measuring paired samples across a clinically relevant concentration range. Let $x_i$ denote the concentration measured by the reference method and $y_i$ the concentration measured by the candidate assay for the same sample $i$. The laboratory has evidence that the analytical imprecision (variance of measurement error) of the two methods is comparable over this range, so the ratio of error variances for Deming regression is $\\lambda = 1$.

The concepts of Deming regression, constant and proportional bias, and Total Allowable Error are standard in the field of clinical laboratory diagnostics. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe task is to perform a Deming regression with an error variance ratio $\\lambda=1$ on a set of paired data $(x_i, y_i)$, and then to compute a specific normalized bias ratio at a given medical decision level.\n\nThe provided data pairs are $(x_i, y_i)$:\n$(50, 50)$, $(80, 78.8)$, $(100, 98)$, $(140, 136.4)$, $(180, 174.8)$, $(220, 213.2)$, $(260, 251.6)$, $(300, 290)$.\nThe number of data pairs is $n=8$.\n\nThe Deming regression fits a linear model $y = mx + b$.

The formulas for the slope $m$ and intercept $b$ depend on summary statistics calculated from the data.\n\nLet us first calculate these summary statistics:\nThe sample means are:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{1}{8}(50 + 80 + 100 + 140 + 180 + 220 + 260 + 300) = \\frac{1330}{8} = 166.25 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \\frac{1}{8}(50 + 78.8 + 98 + 136.4 + 174.8 + 213.2 + 251.6 + 290) = \\frac{1292.8}{8} = 161.6 $$\n\nThe corrected sums of squares and cross-products are:\n$$ S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - n\\bar{x}^2 = 276900 - 8(166.25)^2 = 276900 - 221112.5 = 55787.5 $$\n$$ S_{yy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i^2 - n\\bar{y}^2 = 260330.24 - 8(161.6)^2 = 260330.24 - 208916.48 = 51413.76 $$\n$$ S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - n\\bar{x}\\bar{y} = 268484 - 8(166.25)(161.6) = 268484 - 214928 = 53556 $$\n\nThe formula for the Deming regression slope $m$ with $\\lambda=1$ is:\n$$ m = \\frac{S_{yy} - S_{xx} + \\sqrt{(S_{yy} - S_{xx})^2 + 4 S_{xy}^2}}{2S_{xy}} $$\nHowever, a crucial observation can be made by inspecting the data. Let us test if the data points lie on a perfect line. Consider a line of the form $y = m_0 x + b_0$.\nLet's check the relationship between $y_i$ and $x_i$: for each pair $(x_i, y_i)$, the bias is $y_i - x_i$. Let's examine this bias as a function of $x_i$.\nFor $(50, 50)$, $y_i - x_i = 0$.\nFor $(300, 290)$, $y_i - x_i = -10$.\nThis suggests a linear relationship for the bias itself: $y_i - x_i = \\alpha x_i + \\beta$.\nFrom the two points above:\n$0 = 50\\alpha + \\beta$\n$-10 = 300\\alpha + \\beta$\nSubtracting the first from the second gives $-10 = 250\\alpha$, so $\\alpha = -10/250 = -0.04$.\nThen $\\beta = -50\\alpha = -50(-0.04) = 2$.\nSo, let's test the hypothesis that all data points satisfy the relationship $y_i - x_i = -0.04x_i + 2$, which is equivalent to $y_i = 0.96x_i + 2$.\n- For $x_1=50$, $y_1 = 0.96(50) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50$. (Correct)\n- For $x_2=80$, $y_2 = 0.96(80) + 2 = 76.8 + 2 = 78.8$. (Correct)\n- For $x_3=100$, $y_3 = 0.96(100) + 2 = 96 + 2 = 98$. (Correct)\n- For $x_4=140$, $y_4 = 0.96(140) + 2 = 134.4 + 2 = 136.4$. (Correct)\n- For $x_5=180$, $y_5 = 0.96(180) + 2 = 172.8 + 2 = 174.8$. (Correct)\n- For $x_6=220$, $y_6 = 0.96(220) + 2 = 211.2 + 2 = 213.2$. (Correct)\n- For $x_7=260$, $y_7 = 0.96(260) + 2 = 249.6 + 2 = 251.6$. (Correct)\n- For $x_8=300$, $y_8 = 0.96(300) + 2 = 288 + 2 = 290$. (Correct)\nAll data points lie exactly on the line $y = 0.96x + 2$.\n\nWhen all data points are perfectly collinear, any valid regression method, including Deming regression, will identify this exact line. Therefore, the regression parameters are precisely $m=0.96$ and $b=2$. This avoids potential numerical precision issues with the direct formula evaluation.\n\nThe constant bias is the intercept, $b=2$.\nThe proportional bias is related to the slope, $m-1 = 0.96 - 1 = -0.04$.\n\nThe total predicted systematic bias at a concentration level $c$ is given by $SB(c) = y(c) - c = (mc + b) - c = b + (m-1)c$.\nThe problem asks for this bias at the medical decision level $c^{\\ast} = 180$ mg/dL.\n$$ SB(c^{\\ast}) = b + (m-1)c^{\\ast} = 2 + (0.96 - 1)(180) = 2 + (-0.04)(180) = 2 - 7.2 = -5.2 $$\nThe absolute predicted systematic bias is $|SB(c^{\\ast})| = |-5.2| = 5.2$.\n\nThe Total Allowable Error at this level is defined as $T(c) = 0.1c$.\nAt $c^{\\ast} = 180$ mg/dL, the allowable error is:\n$$ T(c^{\\ast}) = 0.1 \\times 180 = 18 $$\n\nThe final step is to compute the dimensionless ratio of the absolute systematic bias to the total allowable error:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{|SB(c^{\\ast})|}{T(c^{\\ast})} = \\frac{5.2}{18} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{5.2}{18} = \\frac{52}{180} = \\frac{26}{90} = \\frac{13}{45} = 0.2888... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} \\approx 0.2889 $$",
