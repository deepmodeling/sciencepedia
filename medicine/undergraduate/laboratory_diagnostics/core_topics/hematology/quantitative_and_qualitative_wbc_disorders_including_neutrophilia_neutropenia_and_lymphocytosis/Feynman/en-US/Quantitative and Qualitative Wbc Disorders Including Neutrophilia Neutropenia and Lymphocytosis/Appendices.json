            "introduction": "A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is a cornerstone of laboratory hematology, but the reported percentages of different white blood cells (WBCs) can be misleading without context. The true clinical picture emerges only when these relative values are converted into absolute counts. This foundational exercise guides you through the essential calculation of the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC), which are critical for diagnosing conditions like neutrophilia and lymphocytosis. Mastering this conversion is the first step toward interpreting WBC data effectively .",

            "problem": "A complete blood count in a febrile adult shows White Blood Cell count (WBC) of $18.0 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$. The manual differential from a Wright-Giemsa stained smear reports segmented neutrophils $78\\%$, band forms $6\\%$, lymphocytes $12\\%$, monocytes $3\\%$, and eosinophils $1\\%$. In laboratory diagnostics, the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is defined as the absolute number of neutrophils in a unit volume of blood, combining segmented neutrophils and band forms, and the Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) is defined analogously for lymphocytes. Using the core definition that an absolute subtype count equals the total WBC multiplied by the fraction of that subtype in the differential, and treating band forms as part of the neutrophil lineage, compute the ANC and ALC. Express both results in units of $10^9/\\text{L}$ and round each to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and the Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) from a given total White Blood Cell (WBC) count and a manual differential.\n\nThe givens are:\nTotal WBC count, $WBC = 18.0 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$.\nThe differential percentages are:\nPercentage of segmented neutrophils, $P_{seg} = 78\\% = 0.78$.\nPercentage of band forms, $P_{band} = 6\\% = 0.06$.\nPercentage of lymphocytes, $P_{lymph} = 12\\% = 0.12$.\nPercentage of monocytes, $P_{mono} = 3\\% = 0.03$.\nPercentage of eosinophils, $P_{eo} = 1\\% = 0.01$.\nThe sum of these percentages is $78\\% + 6\\% + 12\\% + 3\\% + 1\\% = 100\\%$, which confirms the consistency of the differential count.\n\nThe core definition for calculating an absolute count of a cell subtype is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Absolute Subtype Count} = (\\text{Total WBC Count}) \\times (\\text{Fraction of Subtype}) $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC). The problem states that the ANC combines segmented neutrophils and band forms. Therefore, the total fraction of neutrophils, $f_{neut}$, is the sum of the fractions of segmented neutrophils and band forms.\n$$ f_{neut} = P_{seg} + P_{band} $$\nSubstituting the given percentage values converted to fractions:\n$$ f_{neut} = 0.78 + 0.06 = 0.84 $$\nNow, we can calculate the ANC using the total WBC count:\n$$ ANC = WBC \\times f_{neut} $$\n$$ ANC = (18.0 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}) \\times 0.84 $$\n$$ ANC = 15.12 \\times 10^9/\\text{L} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $15.12$ has four significant figures. Rounding to three significant figures gives $15.1$.\n$$ ANC \\approx 15.1 \\times 10^9/\\text{L} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC). The fraction of lymphocytes, $f_{lymph}$, is given directly in the differential.\n$$ f_{lymph} = P_{lymph} = 12\\% = 0.12 $$\nUsing the same principle, we calculate the ALC:\n$$ ALC = WBC \\times f_{lymph} $$\n$$ ALC = (18.0 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}) \\times 0.12 $$\n$$ ALC = 2.16 \\times 10^9/\\text{L} $$\nThe calculated value $2.16$ already has three significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.\n$$ ALC = 2.16 \\times 10^9/\\text{L} $$\n\nThe problem asks for both results, ANC and ALC, expressed in units of $10^9/\\text{L}$.\nThe final numerical values are $15.1$ for the ANC and $2.16$ for the ALC.",

            "problem": "A patient in the intensive care unit has a suspected qualitative and quantitative white blood cell disorder, with significant hypoxia and a peripheral smear showing numerous nucleated red blood cells. An automated hematology analyzer reports a measured White Blood Cell (WBC) count of $22.0 \\times 10^9/\\text{L}$. A manual review quantifies Nucleated Red Blood Cells (NRBC) at $25$ per $100$ true White Blood Cells (WBC).

The automated analyzer counts all nucleated particles, so the total number of measured events, $N_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is the sum of the true WBCs and the NRBCs.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{meas}} = N_{WBC} + N_{NRBC}\n$$\nThis relationship holds for concentrations as well. Let $WBC_{\\mathrm{corr}}$ be the true, corrected WBC concentration and $WBC_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ be the measured WBC concentration.\n$$\nWBC_{\\mathrm{meas}} = WBC_{\\mathrm{corr}} + NRBC_{\\mathrm{conc}}\n$$\nwhere $NRBC_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ is the concentration of NRBCs.\n\nThe NRBC burden, $r$, is defined as the number of NRBCs per 100 true WBCs.
