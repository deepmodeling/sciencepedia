            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence) are provided, and the values are realistic for the described clinical scenario. The problem adheres to standard principles of diagnostic test evaluation in biostatistics and clinical laboratory science. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has true opiate exposure (the \"disease\" is present), and let $\\neg D$ be the event that the patient has no opiate exposure. Let $T$ be the event of a positive test result from the immunoassay, and let $\\neg T$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n-   Prevalence, $P(D) = 0.01$. From this, the probability of not having the disease is $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$.\n-   Sensitivity (Sens), the probability of a positive test given disease, is $P(T|D) = 0.95$.\n-   Specificity (Spec), the probability of a negative test given no disease, is $P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.98$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the false negative and false positive rates:\n-   False Negative Rate (FNR) is $P(\\neg T|D) = 1 - P(T|D) = 1 - \\text{Sens} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n-   False Positive Rate (FPR) is $P(T|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1 - \\text{Spec} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Analytic Expressions**\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient with a positive test result truly has the disease, i.e., $P(D|T)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nPPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the two mutually exclusive states of disease (present or absent):\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence (letting $P=P(D)$):\n$$\nP(T) = (\\text{Sens}) \\cdot P + (1 - \\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - P)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for PPV gives the final analytic form:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{(\\text{Sens}) \\cdot P}{(\\text{Sens}) \\cdot P + (1 - \\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - P)}\n$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that a patient with a negative test result is truly free of the disease, i.e., $P(\\neg D|\\neg T)$.\nUsing Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nNPV = P(\\neg D|\\neg T) = \\frac{P(\\neg T|\\neg D) P(\\neg D)}{P(\\neg T)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(\\neg T)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T|D)P(D) + P(\\neg T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)\n$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\nP(\\neg T) = (1 - \\text{Sens}) \\cdot P + (\\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - P)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for NPV gives the final analytic form:\n$$\nNPV = \\frac{(\\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - P)}{(1 - \\text{Sens}) \\cdot P + (\\text{Spec}) \\cdot (1 - P)}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of Numerical Values**\n\nUsing the derived expressions and the given numerical values:\n$\\text{Sens} = 0.95$, $\\text{Spec} = 0.98$, and $P = 0.01$.\n\nFor PPV:\n$$\nPPV = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.01}{0.95 \\times 0.01 + (1 - 0.98) \\times (1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.02 \\times 0.99} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0095 + 0.0198} = \\frac{0.0095}{0.0293}\n$$\n$$\nPPV \\approx 0.32423208...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.3242$.\n\nFor NPV:\n$$\nNPV = \\frac{0.98 \\times (1 - 0.01)}{(1 - 0.95) \\times 0.01 + 0.98 \\times (1 - 0.01)} = \\frac{0.98 \\times 0.99}{0.05 \\times 0.01 + 0.98 \\times 0.99} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.0005 + 0.9702} = \\frac{0.9702}{0.9707}\n$$\n$$\nNPV \\approx 0.9994848...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9995$.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of Clinical Implications**\n\nThe computed Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is $0.3242$, meaning that only about $32.4\\%$ of positive screening tests in this population will reflect true opiate exposure. Conversely, about $67.6\\%$ of positive results are false positives. This low PPV is a direct consequence of the low prevalence ($1\\%$) of the condition in the tested population, even with a test that has high sensitivity and specificity. Relying on a positive immunoassay result alone to diagnose opiate use would lead to a high rate of misdiagnosis.\n\nThe computed Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is $0.9995$, which is extremely high. This means that a negative test result is very reliable; there is a $99.95\\%$ probability that a person with a negative result has not been exposed to opiates.\n\nThe clinical implication is that this immunoassay serves as an excellent **screening test** to **rule out** opiate exposure due to its high NPV. A negative result provides strong evidence to pursue other diagnoses. However, due to its low PPV, it is a poor **confirmatory test**. Any positive result from this immunoassay must be considered presumptive and requires confirmation by a method with higher specificity, such as Gas Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). GC-MS is considered a gold standard because it structurally identifies the molecule, nearly eliminating false positives ($Specificity \\approx 1.00$). The standard clinical workflow is a two-tiered approach: screen with the sensitive but less specific immunoassay, and then confirm all positive screens with the highly specific GC-MS method. This strategy maximizes the identification of potential positives while ensuring that final diagnostic conclusions are based on highly reliable evidence, thereby preventing the serious medical and social consequences of a false-positive result.",

The laboratory director wants to select $t$ to minimize expected decision cost while considering asymmetric consequences of false positives and false negatives.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible model and context:\n- In individuals truly without recent morphine exposure (the \"negative\" class), the reported concentration $x$ has a distribution $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_0, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu_0 = 30$ ng/mL and $\\sigma = 25$ ng/mL, reflecting baseline signal and biological variability.\n- In individuals truly with recent morphine exposure (the \"positive\" class), the reported concentration $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma^2)$ with $\\mu_1 = 200$ ng/mL and the same $\\sigma = 25$ ng/mL, reflecting higher signal with similar analytical imprecision.\n- The prevalence of true recent morphine exposure among those tested is $\\pi = 0.10$.\n- The unit cost assigned to a false positive is $C_{\\mathrm{FP}} = 1$ (arbitrary units), and to a false negative is $C_{\\mathrm{FN}} = 8$ (arbitrary units), capturing the asymmetry in consequences.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of sensitivity and specificity, the probabilistic structure of the two-class model, and the decision-theoretic principle that the optimal threshold minimizes expected cost, use Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis to derive an analytic expression for the cost-minimizing threshold $t$ in terms of $\\mu_0$, $\\mu_1$, $\\sigma$, $\\pi$, $C_{\\mathrm{FP}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{FN}}$.

It represents a standard application of statistical decision theory to laboratory diagnostics.\n\nThe objective is to find the decision threshold $t$ that minimizes the total expected cost of misclassification. The expected cost, $E[C(t)]$, is the sum of the costs of false positives and false negatives, weighted by their respective probabilities of occurrence.\n\nLet $D_0$ denote the event that an individual is truly negative (no morphine exposure) and $D_1$ denote the event that an individual is truly positive (with morphine exposure).

Let $X$ be the concentration of pseudoephedrine in $\\mathrm{ng/mL}$. The amphetamine-equivalent signal, $Y$, produced by this concentration is given by the cross-reactivity relation:\n$$Y = r \\cdot X$$\nwhere $r = 0.010$.\n\nThe condition for a positive screen is $Y \\ge C_{amp}$, where $C_{amp} = 500 \\, \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. Substituting the expression for $Y$, we get:\n$$rX \\ge C_{amp}$$\nThis is equivalent to the pseudoephedrine concentration $X$ being greater than or equal to a critical threshold, which we will call $x_{crit}$:\n$$X \\ge \\frac{C_{amp}}{r} = x_{crit}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$x_{crit} = \\frac{500 \\, \\mathrm{ng/mL}}{0.010} = 50000 \\, \\mathrm{ng/mL}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability $P(X \\ge x_{crit})$.
