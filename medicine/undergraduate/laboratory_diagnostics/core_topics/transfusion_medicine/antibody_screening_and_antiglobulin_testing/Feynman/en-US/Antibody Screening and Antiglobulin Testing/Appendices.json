            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics, specifically circular motion, and is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, constants, and data for a unique solution. The parameters are realistic for a laboratory setting. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (RPM) and then calculate its numerical value for the given parameters. The derivation must start from the fundamental relationships provided.\n\nLet $N$ be the rotational speed in RPM. The provided relationships are:\n1.  Centripetal acceleration: $a_c = \\omega^2 r$\n2.  Definition of Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF): $RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g}$\n3.  Angular velocity and frequency: $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$\n4.  Frequency and RPM: $f = \\frac{N}{60}$\n\nThe problem states a target RCF of $900 \\times g$. This is a common but slightly informal way of stating that the centripetal acceleration $a_c$ should be $900$ times the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. Using the formal definition provided, $RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g}$, we can determine the dimensionless value of RCF. If $a_c = 900g$, then $RCF = \\frac{900g}{g} = 900$. Thus, the numerical value for the variable $RCF$ is $900$.\n\nWe begin the derivation by combining the first two equations to relate RCF to the angular velocity $\\omega$.\nFrom the definition $RCF = \\frac{a_c}{g}$, we can express the centripetal acceleration as:\n$$a_c = RCF \\cdot g$$\nSubstituting the expression for centripetal acceleration, $a_c = \\omega^2 r$, we get:\n$$\\omega^2 r = RCF \\cdot g$$\nNow, we solve for the angular velocity $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega^2 = \\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}$$\n$$\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nThe angular velocity $\\omega$ is in units of radians per second. The problem requires the final answer in revolutions per minute ($N$). We use the provided kinematic links to convert $\\omega$ to $N$.\nFirst, we relate angular velocity $\\omega$ to frequency $f$ (in Hz or revolutions per second):\n$$\\omega = 2 \\pi f$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\omega$:\n$$2 \\pi f = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nSolving for frequency $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nNext, we relate frequency $f$ to the rotational speed $N$ in RPM. Since there are $60$ seconds in a minute, the frequency in revolutions per second is the RPM value divided by $60$:\n$$f = \\frac{N}{60}$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $f$:\n$$\\frac{N}{60} = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nFinally, we solve for $N$ to obtain the desired general expression for the rotational speed in RPM:\n$$N = \\frac{60}{2 \\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF \\cdot g}{r}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the required rotational speed in terms of $RCF$, $g$, and $r$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. The given parameters are:\n-   $RCF = 900$ (dimensionless)\n-   $g = 9.80665 \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}$\n-   $r = 10 \\, \\text{cm}$\n\nWe must use consistent units. The radius $r$ is converted to meters:\n$$r = 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 0.10 \\, \\text{m}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the derived formula for $N$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{900 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-2}}{0.10 \\, \\text{m}}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the term under the square root:\n$$\\frac{900 \\times 9.80665}{0.10} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} = \\frac{8825.985}{0.10} \\, \\text{s}^{-2} = 88259.85 \\, \\text{s}^{-2}$$\nNow, we take the square root:\n$$\\sqrt{88259.85 \\, \\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 297.085595 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we multiply by the pre-factor $\\frac{30}{\\pi}$:\n$$N = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\times 297.085595 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nThe unit $\\text{s}^{-1}$ is revolutions per second. The factor of $60$ included in the derivation (via the term $30 = 60/2$) converts this to revolutions per minute.\n$$N \\approx 9.54929658 \\times 297.085595 \\approx 2836.953 \\, \\text{RPM}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$N \\approx 2840 \\, \\text{RPM}$$\nTo express this with three significant figures unambiguously, we use scientific notation: $2.84 \\times 10^{3}$.",

Immunoglobulin G (IgG) only\n    2.  Complement only\n    3.  A mixture of both IgG and complement\n*   **Context:** A patient with suspected *in vivo* RBC sensitization.\n*   **Definitions and Principles:**\n    *   The Direct Antiglobulin Test (DAT) detects *in vivo* coating of RBCs. The procedure involves adding Anti-Human Globulin (AHG) to washed patient RBCs.\n    *   Polyspecific AHG contains both anti-IgG and anti-complement activity.\n    *   Monospecific AHG contains either only anti-IgG or only anti-complement (e.g., anti-C3d).\n    *   Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is an anticoagulant that prevents *in vitro* complement activation by chelating divalent cations.\n    *   Check cells are required to validate negative antiglobulin tests.\n*   **Task:** Identify the single best algorithm that reliably discriminates the three sensitization categories while maintaining controls and scientific rigor.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of immunohematology and transfusion medicine. The roles of the DAT, polyspecific and monospecific AHG reagents, EDTA anticoagulation, and control cells (check cells) are all described accurately and are fundamental to the field. The classification of sensitization into IgG-only, complement-only, and mixed-type is standard clinical practice, particularly in the workup of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA).\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear diagnostic goal and provides the necessary tools and constraints (e.g., use of established reagents, requirement for controls) to construct a single, optimal testing algorithm based on efficiency and accuracy.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem statement is objective, using precise, standard terminology without any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n**Solution Derivation and Option Analysis**\n\n**Derivation of the Ideal Algorithm**\n\nThe objective is to create a reliable and efficient algorithm to detect and characterize proteins coating a patient's RBCs *in vivo*.\n\n1.  **Sample Collection:** To prevent *in vitro* artifacts, particularly the activation of complement that can occur in clotted samples (serum) at room temperature or colder, the blood sample must be collected in an anticoagulant tube that chelates calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$), the divalent cations required for complement cascade activation. EDTA is the standard choice for this purpose.\n\n2.  **Initial Washing Step:** Before testing, the patient's RBCs must be thoroughly washed with saline. This is a critical step to remove the patient's plasma, which contains unbound immunoglobulins and complement proteins. If not removed, these unbound proteins would neutralize the AHG reagent, leading to a false-negative result.\n\n3.  **Screening Test:** A logical workflow begins with a broad screening test to determine if *any* sensitization is present. Polyspecific AHG, which detects both IgG and complement (C3d), is the ideal reagent for this initial screen.\n    *   **If the polyspecific DAT is negative:** This indicates no significant coating with IgG or C3d. However, a negative result must be validated. This is achieved by adding IgG-sensitized control cells (check cells) to the test tube. The free AHG in the tube should agglutinate these cells, confirming the reagent was added and is reactive. A validated negative result concludes the test.\n    *   **If the polyspecific DAT is positive:** This confirms that the RBCs are coated with IgG, complement, or both. The next step is to determine which.\n\n4.  **Differential Testing:** Following a positive polyspecific DAT, the specific protein(s) must be identified. This is accomplished by testing aliquots of the same washed patient RBCs with monospecific AHG reagents in parallel.\n    *   One aliquot is tested with monospecific anti-IgG.\n    *   A second aliquot is tested with monospecific anti-complement (anti-C3d).\n\n5.  **Interpretation:** The results of the monospecific tests differentiate the type of sensitization:\n    *   Anti-IgG positive AND Anti-C3d negative $\\implies$ IgG-only coating.\n    *   Anti-IgG negative AND Anti-C3d positive $\\implies$ Complement-only coating.\n    *   Anti-IgG positive AND Anti-C3d positive $\\implies$ Mixed (IgG + Complement) coating.\n\n6.  **Validation of Negative Monospecific Tests:** Any negative result in the monospecific testing phase must also be validated to ensure the reagent is active.\n    *   If the anti-IgG test is negative, its validity is confirmed by adding IgG-coated check cells.\n    *   If the anti-C3d test is negative, its validity should be confirmed by adding C3d-coated check cells. This ensures the anti-C3d reagent itself is working correctly.\n\nThis derived algorithm represents the most rigorous, efficient, and scientifically sound approach.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Collect EDTA-anticoagulated blood to prevent *in vitro* complement fixation. Wash patient RBCs to remove unbound serum proteins. Perform a DAT with polyspecific AHG. If negative, validate with IgG-sensitized check cells and report no significant *in vivo* coating. If positive, test the same washed RBCs in parallel with monospecific anti-IgG and monospecific anti-C3d. Interpret as follows: anti-IgG positive with anti-C3d negative indicates IgG-only; anti-IgG negative with anti-C3d positive indicates complement-only; both positive indicates mixed sensitization. Validate each negative monospecific tube with appropriate control cells (IgG-sensitized control cells for anti-IgG or polyspecific AHG; C3d-coated control cells for anti-C3d).**\n\nThis option precisely mirrors the ideal algorithm derived above. It specifies the correct sample type (EDTA), washing, the logical use of polyspecific AHG for screening followed by monospecific reagents for characterization, the correct interpretation of all possible outcomes, and the most rigorous quality control, including the use of specific check cells for each type of negative reagent.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Collect clotted blood (serum). Perform a DAT using monospecific anti-IgG only; if nonreactive, call complement-only coating; if reactive, call IgG-only coating; no further testing is required because anti-IgG reactivity excludes complement coating.**\n\nThis option contains multiple fundamental errors.\n1.  Using clotted blood allows for potential *in vitro* complement activation, which can cause a false-positive DAT for complement. The standard is EDTA blood.\n2.  Using only anti-IgG as the initial test is an incomplete screen; it will fail to detect cases of complement-only sensitization.\n3.  The logic is flawed: a negative anti-IgG test does not prove the presence of complement, and a positive anti-IgG test does not rule out the concurrent presence of complement (mixed sensitization). In fact, IgG antibodies (subclasses IgG1 and IgG3) are primary activators of the classical complement pathway.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Perform an Indirect Antiglobulin Test (IAT) by incubating patient plasma with reagent group O RBCs. If the IAT is reactive, conclude the patient’s RBCs are IgG-coated; if nonreactive, conclude complement-only coating; if weakly reactive, conclude mixed sensitization.**\n\nThis option fundamentally misunderstands the purpose of the tests. The problem asks about *in vivo* sensitization on the patient's RBCs, which is detected by the DAT. This option describes the IAT, which is used to detect unexpected antibodies in the patient's plasma/serum by testing it against reagent RBCs. The results of an IAT do not directly report the coating status of the patient's own circulating RBCs.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Perform a DAT using polyspecific AHG only. If positive, elute and test the eluate against a standard panel; if the eluate is reactive, report IgG-only coating; if the eluate is nonreactive, report complement-only coating; no monospecific AHG testing is needed because elution resolves the coating class.**\n\nThis option misuses the elution technique. Elution is a procedure used to detach antibodies from the RBC surface for subsequent identification of their specificity. It is not the primary method for distinguishing between IgG and complement coating. While a reactive eluate confirms the presence of an IgG antibody, it does not exclude the co-existence of complement on the RBC surface. A non-reactive eluate is not definitive proof of complement-only sensitization. The direct, standard, and correct method is to use monospecific AHG reagents.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Collect EDTA-anticoagulated blood. Perform a DAT with monospecific anti-C3d. If positive, report complement-only; if negative, follow with monospecific anti-IgG and report IgG-only if positive. Do not perform polyspecific AHG because it adds no diagnostic value; validation with IgG-sensitized check cells is sufficient for all tubes.**\n\nThis option has several flaws.\n1.  The algorithm is inefficient by starting with a monospecific reagent.\n2.  The logic is critically flawed as it cannot detect mixed-type sensitization. If the initial anti-C3d is positive, it incorrectly concludes \"complement-only\" without testing for concurrent IgG.\n3.  The statement that polyspecific AHG \"adds no diagnostic value\" is false; it is the most efficient screening reagent.\n4.  The quality control is inadequate. Using only IgG-sensitized check cells cannot validate a negative anti-C3d reagent; C3d-coated check cells are required for that purpose.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The transfusion service must screen donor red blood cell units to find units antigen-negative for the relevant targets, guided by the principle that an antigen-negative unit will not be bound by the corresponding antibody during an IAT crossmatch.\n\nAssume the following population antigen-negative prevalences for donor units: the probability of being Kell K-negative is $p(K^-) = 0.91$, the probability of being Rh E-negative is $p(E^-) = 0.70$, and the probability of being Kidd Jk(a)-negative is $p(Jk(a)^-) = 0.23$.

This is a classic waiting-time problem in probability theory. The process of screening units one by one, where each screening is independent and results in either a success (the unit qualifies) or a failure (it does not), is modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nLet $p$ be the probability of success in a single trial, where success is defined as finding a donor unit with the required antigen-negative profile. We are tasked with finding the expected number of trials, $E[N]$, required to obtain exactly $k=2$ successes.\n\nThis scenario is described by the negative binomial distribution. Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of trials needed to achieve $k$ successes. The expected value of $N$ is given by the formula:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{k}{p}$$\n\nThis formula can be derived from the properties of the geometric distribution, which describes the number of trials needed for the *first* success. The expected number of trials for the first success is $\\frac{1}{p}$. Since the trials are independent, the expected number of *additional* trials to get the second success after the first has occurred is also $\\frac{1}{p}$.
