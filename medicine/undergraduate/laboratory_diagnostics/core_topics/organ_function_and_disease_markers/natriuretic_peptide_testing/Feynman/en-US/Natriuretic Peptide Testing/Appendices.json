            "introduction": "To effectively use natriuretic peptide testing, we must first understand the physiological and pharmacological factors that govern their concentrations. This first practice invites you to model the steady-state plasma concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide ($BNP$) using a fundamental mass-balance equation. By exploring how a neprilysin inhibitor affects $BNP$ degradation, you will gain a crucial insight into why $BNP$ levels rise with this therapy, a concept essential for distinguishing a therapeutic effect from worsening disease .",

            "problem": "A patient with chronic heart failure has a circulating concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) determined by a balance between secretion from cardiac myocytes and enzymatic degradation, including degradation by neprilysin. Model the plasma concentration of BNP, denoted by $C(t)$, using a well-accepted mass-balance model with first-order degradation: secretion occurs at a constant rate $S$ (mass per unit time), and total degradation follows first-order kinetics with rate constant $k$ (per unit time). The patient is started on a neprilysin inhibitor, which reduces the effective degradation rate constant by $50\\%$, while the secretion rate remains unchanged over the time scale of interest. Assume the system rapidly reaches the new steady state relative to the measurement time.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from the mass-balance and first-order kinetics definitions, determine the expected fold-change in the steady-state plasma BNP concentration relative to baseline, i.e., compute $C_{\\text{new}}/C_{\\text{old}}$. Express your final answer as a pure number (dimensionless). Then, based on your result, interpret whether the laboratory BNP signal increases or decreases immediately after initiating neprilysin inhibition and explain why in terms of the model. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the steady-state concentration of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) based on a mass-balance model. Let $C(t)$ represent the plasma concentration of BNP at time $t$. The total mass of BNP in the plasma volume $V$ is $M(t) = C(t)V$.\n\nThe rate of change of the mass of BNP in the plasma, $\\frac{dM}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between the rate of secretion, $S$, and the rate of degradation. The secretion rate is given as a constant, $S$. The degradation is described as a first-order process, meaning its rate is proportional to the total mass, given by $kM(t)$, where $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant.\n\nThe mass-balance differential equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = S - kM(t)\n$$\n\nTo express this equation in terms of concentration $C(t)$, we substitute $M(t) = C(t)V$ and divide by the constant volume $V$:\n$$\n\\frac{d(C(t)V)}{dt} = S - k(C(t)V)\n$$\n$$\nV \\frac{dC}{dt} = S - kVC(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{S}{V} - kC(t)\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the concentration is constant, so its time derivative is zero, $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. Let $C_{\\text{ss}}$ denote the steady-state concentration.\n$$\n0 = \\frac{S}{V} - kC_{\\text{ss}}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{ss}}$ yields:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{S}{kV}\n$$\n\nInitially, before the administration of the neprilysin inhibitor, the system is at a baseline steady state. Let the initial degradation rate constant be $k_{\\text{old}}$. The baseline steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{old}}$, is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{S}{k_{\\text{old}}V}\n$$\n\nThe patient is then started on a neprilysin inhibitor. According to the problem statement, this intervention does not change the secretion rate $S$, but it reduces the effective degradation rate constant by $50\\%$. The new degradation rate constant, $k_{\\text{new}}$, is therefore:\n$$\nk_{\\text{new}} = k_{\\text{old}} - 0.50 \\cdot k_{\\text{old}} = (1 - 0.50)k_{\\text{old}} = 0.5 k_{\\text{old}}\n$$\n\nAfter the inhibitor is administered, the system reaches a new steady state. The new steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{new}}$, is found using the same steady-state formula but with the new rate constant $k_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{S}{k_{\\text{new}}V}\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fold-change in the steady-state concentration, which is the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\text{new}}}{C_{\\text{old}}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{new}}}{C_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{S}{k_{\\text{new}}V}}{\\frac{S}{k_{\\text{old}}V}}\n$$\nThe terms $S$ and $V$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{new}}}{C_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{old}}}{k_{\\text{new}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{new}}}{C_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{old}}}{0.5 k_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{1}{0.5} = 2\n$$\nThe expected fold-change in the steady-state plasma BNP concentration is $2$.\n\nFor the interpretation, we consider the dynamics immediately after the neprilysin inhibitor is introduced. At baseline steady state, the rate of secretion is perfectly balanced by the rate of degradation:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of secretion} = \\text{Rate of degradation}_{\\text{old}} \\implies S = k_{\\text{old}}M_{\\text{old}} = k_{\\text{old}}VC_{\\text{old}}\n$$\nImmediately after inhibition, at time $t=0^+$, the concentration is still at the baseline level, $C_{\\text{old}}$, but the degradation rate constant has dropped to $k_{\\text{new}} = 0.5 k_{\\text{old}}$. The secretion rate $S$ remains unchanged. The new, instantaneous rate of degradation is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of degradation}_{\\text{new}} = k_{\\text{new}}VC_{\\text{old}} = (0.5 k_{\\text{old}})VC_{\\text{old}} = 0.5 (k_{\\text{old}}VC_{\\text{old}}) = 0.5 S\n$$\nAt this moment, the rate of secretion ($S$) is greater than the rate of degradation ($0.5 S$). This imbalance means that the net rate of change of BNP mass, $\\frac{dM}{dt} = S - 0.5S = 0.5S$, is positive. Consequently, the mass and concentration of BNP in the plasma begin to increase. The laboratory BNP signal will therefore increase immediately after initiating neprilysin inhibition. This increase will continue until a new steady state is reached where the degradation rate, $k_{\\text{new}}VC_{\\text{new}}$, once again equals the secretion rate $S$, which occurs when the concentration has doubled to $C_{\\text{new}} = 2C_{\\text{old}}$.",

The derivation will proceed from the foundational principles provided.\n\nLet $H$ be the event that the patient has acute heart failure, and let $T$ be the event that the NT-proBNP test is positive.\nThe pre-test probability of acute heart failure is $P(H) = P_{\\text{pre}}$.\nThe post-test probability of acute heart failure, given a positive test result, is $P(H|T) = P_{\\text{post}}$.\n\nThe derivation begins with the two provided statements:\n1.
