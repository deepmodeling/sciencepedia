Before you can report the number of cells per milliliter, you must first know the precise physical dimensions of the area you are observing. This practice guides you through the fundamental laboratory procedure of calibrating an eyepiece micrometer using a stage micrometer, allowing you to determine the exact diameter and area of your high-power field . Mastering this calibration is the essential first step for any accurate quantitative analysis.",

            "problem": "A clinical microscopy laboratory is standardizing quantitative counting of formed elements in urine sediment under the high-power field (HPF) to ensure comparability across observers and instruments. The microscope uses a $10\\times$ eyepiece fitted with an eyepiece micrometer (EPM) scale and a $40\\times$ objective, giving a total magnification of $400\\times$. A stage micrometer with a $1\\,\\text{mm}$ main scale divided into $100$ equal divisions is available; therefore each stage micrometer division represents a physical length of $0.01\\,\\text{mm}$ on the specimen plane.\n\nTo calibrate the EPM at $40\\times$ objective, the stage micrometer and EPM are superimposed and centered. It is observed that exactly $26$ EPM divisions span $11.5$ stage micrometer divisions. After calibration, the diameter of the circular field of view is measured by translating across the field center: the field circle spans exactly $103$ EPM divisions along a diameter.\n\nUsing only the laboratory-standard definitions that a stage micrometer division represents a fixed physical length on the specimen plane, that an eyepiece micrometer division is arbitrary until calibrated against a known length, and that the field of view is a circle at the specimen plane, derive the calibrated length per EPM division, the field diameter in millimeters, and the field area in square millimeters appropriate for quantitative counting in urine sediment.\n\nExpress the final diameter in millimeters (mm) and the field area in square millimeters (mm$^2$).

            "solution": "The task is to determine the calibrated length per eyepiece micrometer (EPM) division, the diameter of the field of view in millimeters, and the area of the field of view in square millimeters.\n\nFirst, we establish the physical length of a single division on the stage micrometer. The stage micrometer has a $1\\,\\text{mm}$ scale divided into $100$ parts.\nLet $L_{SMD}$ be the length of one stage micrometer division.\n$$L_{SMD} = \\frac{1\\,\\text{mm}}{100} = 0.01\\,\\text{mm}$$\n\nNext, we use the calibration data to find the physical length corresponding to a single EPM division. It is given that $26$ EPM divisions coincide with $11.5$ stage micrometer divisions. Let $L_{cal}$ be the total physical length used for calibration.\n$$L_{cal} = 11.5 \\times L_{SMD} = 11.5 \\times 0.01\\,\\text{mm} = 0.115\\,\\text{mm}$$\nThis physical length, $L_{cal}$, corresponds to $26$ EPM divisions. Let $C$ be the calibration factor, representing the physical length in millimeters per EPM division.\n$$C = \\frac{L_{cal}}{26\\,\\text{EPM divisions}} = \\frac{0.115\\,\\text{mm}}{26} \\approx 0.004423077\\,\\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{EPM division}}$$\nThis is the calibrated length per EPM division.\n\nNow, we can calculate the diameter of the field of view, $D_{FOV}$, in millimeters.

            "introduction": "To increase the chance of detecting significant findings, urine sediment is concentrated by centrifugation before examination. This crucial step, however, means that the concentration of elements in the sediment is much higher than in the original urine. This exercise demonstrates how to calculate the factor needed to correct for this concentration effect, a vital step in reporting clinically accurate results from a prepared sample .",

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory concentrates urine by centrifugation prior to microscopic examination. An initial volume of $15$ mL of urine is centrifuged, the supernatant is decanted, and the cellular sediment is uniformly resuspended to a final volume of $0.5$ mL. During microscopic analysis, observers record counts per High-Power Field (HPF). To report results standardized to the original urine, one must apply a multiplicative correction that accounts for the change in volume between the original urine and the resuspended sediment, independent of any geometric conversion from HPF to a unit volume. Using the fundamental principle that the total number of particles recovered is conserved and that concentration is defined as the number of particles per unit volume, determine the centrifugation-derived dilution factor, defined here as the dimensionless multiplicative constant $f$ that maps a concentration measured in the sediment to the corresponding concentration in the original urine. That is, if $C_{s}$ is a concentration derived from the sediment (for example, after separately converting counts per HPF to counts per mL of sediment), then $C_{o} = f \\, C_{s}$ gives the concentration in the original urine. Express your final answer as a pure number with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a dimensionless factor, $f$, which relates the concentration of particles in a resuspended urine sediment to the concentration in the original, unprocessed urine sample.\n\nLet $V_o$ be the initial volume of the original urine and $V_s$ be the final volume of the resuspended sediment. The problem provides these values as:\n$$V_o = 15 \\text{ mL}$$\n$$V_s = 0.5 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nLet $C_o$ be the concentration of particles (e.g., cells, casts) in the original urine, and let $C_s$ be the concentration of the same particles in the resuspended sediment. Concentration is defined as the number of particles per unit volume.\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of particles present in the initial urine sample. The principle of conservation states that the same number of particles, $N$, is present in the final resuspended sediment.\n\nBased on the definition of concentration, we can express the total number of particles $N$ in two ways:\n1.  From the original urine: $N = C_o \\times V_o$\n2.  From the resuspended sediment: $N = C_s \\times V_s$\n\nSince the number of particles $N$ is conserved, we can equate these two expressions:\n$$C_o V_o = C_s V_s$$\n\nThe problem defines the factor $f$ as the constant that maps the sediment concentration to the original concentration, given by the relation:\n$$C_o = f \\, C_s$$\n\nWe can substitute this definition of $C_o$ into our conservation equation:\n$$(f \\, C_s) V_o = C_s V_s$$\n\nTo solve for $f$, we can divide both sides by $C_s$ (assuming $C_s \\neq 0$, which is necessary for a meaningful measurement).\n$$f \\, V_o = V_s$$\n\nNow, we can isolate $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{V_s}{V_o}$$\n\nThis equation shows that the factor $f$ is the ratio of the final sediment volume to the initial urine volume. The units of volume (mL) cancel out, confirming that $f$ is a dimensionless quantity as required.\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$f = \\frac{0.5 \\text{ mL}}{15 \\text{ mL}} = \\frac{0.5}{15}$$\n\nTo express this as a simple fraction, we can write $0.5$ as $\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$f = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{15} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 15} = \\frac{1}{30}$$\n\nThus, the centrifugation-derived factor $f$ is $\\frac{1}{30}$. This is consistent with the physical situation: the sediment is a concentrated form of the original urine, so its measured concentration $C_s$ must be multiplied by a factor less than $1$ to find the lower concentration $C_o$ of the original sample. Specifically, the original concentration is $\\frac{1}{30}$ of the sediment concentration.",

            "problem": "A laboratory diagnostics team performs microscopic examination of urine sediment to quantify red blood cells (RBC). Starting from first principles, consider the following scenario. A urine specimen of initial volume $V_{o} = 15$ milliliters is centrifuged and the sediment is uniformly resuspended to a final volume $V_{s} = 0.5$ milliliters. Under a $40\\times$ objective, an average of $5$ red blood cells (RBC) are observed per High Power Field (HPF). The microscope’s field of view at this magnification has an effective projected area $A = 0.18$ square millimeters, and the fluid layer thickness under the coverslip is $h = 0.02$ millimeters. Assume uniform distribution of cells within the sediment, no loss or lysis of cells during processing, and that the count per HPF is an unbiased estimate of the mean. Use the facts that the field volume is given by area times thickness and that $1$ cubic millimeter equals $1$ microliter, which equals $1 \\times 10^{-3}$ milliliters. Derive, from these bases, the concentration of RBC in the original urine specimen in units of RBC per milliliter. Express your final answer in RBC per milliliter and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the concentration of red blood cells (RBC) in the original, unprocessed urine specimen, denoted as $C_{o}$, in units of RBC per milliliter. The solution will be derived from the provided first principles and data.\n\nLet us define the given variables:\n- Initial volume of the urine specimen: $V_{o} = 15$ mL\n- Final volume of the resuspended sediment: $V_{s} = 0.5$ mL\n- Average number of RBCs per High Power Field: $N_{HPF} = 5$\n- Projected area of the High Power Field: $A = 0.18$ mm$^2$\n- Thickness of the fluid layer under the coverslip: $h = 0.02$ mm\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three logical steps.\n\nFirst, we calculate the volume of a single High Power Field ($V_{HPF}$). The problem states that the field volume is the product of its area and the fluid thickness.\n$$V_{HPF} = A \\times h$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{HPF} = (0.18 \\text{ mm}^2) \\times (0.02 \\text{ mm}) = 0.0036 \\text{ mm}^3$$\nTo facilitate subsequent calculations, we convert this volume into milliliters (mL) using the provided conversion factors: $1 \\text{ mm}^3 = 1 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L}$ and $1 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L} = 1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mL}$.\n$$V_{HPF} = 0.0036 \\text{ mm}^3 \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L}}{1 \\text{ mm}^3} \\times \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mL}}{1 \\text{ }\\mu\\text{L}} = 0.0036 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ mL} = 3.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mL}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the concentration of RBCs in the resuspended sediment, denoted as $C_{s}$. Concentration is defined as the number of particles per unit volume. The problem states that the average count of $N_{HPF} = 5$ RBCs is observed within the volume $V_{HPF}$. The assumption of uniform distribution allows us to use this ratio to define the concentration.\n$$C_{s} = \\frac{N_{HPF}}{V_{HPF}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$C_{s} = \\frac{5 \\text{ RBC}}{3.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mL}}$$\n\nThird, we relate the concentration in the sediment ($C_s$) to the concentration in the original specimen ($C_o$). The problem states that there is no loss or lysis of cells. This implies that the total number of cells, $N_{total}$, is conserved throughout the process.\nThe total number of cells in the resuspended sediment is the product of its concentration and volume:\n$$N_{total} = C_{s} \\times V_{s}$$\nThis same total number of cells was originally present in the initial urine volume $V_{o}$. Therefore, the original concentration $C_{o}$ is:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{N_{total}}{V_{o}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{total}$:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{C_{s} \\times V_{s}}{V_{o}}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $C_{s}$:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{N_{HPF}}{V_{HPF}}\\right) \\times V_{s}}{V_{o}} = \\frac{N_{HPF} \\times V_{s}}{V_{HPF} \\times V_{o}}$$\nThis final expression relates the desired original concentration $C_o$ to the quantities given in the problem. Let us now substitute all numerical values into this equation:\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{5 \\times 0.5 \\text{ mL}}{(3.6 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ mL}) \\times 15 \\text{ mL}}$$\nThe units of mL cancel appropriately, leaving the result in units of RBC/mL.\n$$C_{o} = \\frac{2.5}{54 \\times 10^{-6}} \\text{ RBC/mL} = \\frac{2.5}{5.4 \\times 10^{-5}} \\text{ RBC/mL}$$\n$$C_{o} \\approx 46296.296... \\text{ RBC/mL}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant digits are $4$, $6$, $2$, and $9$. The fifth digit is $6$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$C_{o} \\approx 46300 \\text{ RBC/mL}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation to explicitly show four significant figures:\n$$C_{o} = 4.630 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ RBC/mL}$$",
