A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to calculate the total expected number of photons emitted, which will be denoted as $P_{total}$. The calculation proceeds by following the definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\n$1$. First, we calculate the total number of acridinium ester label molecules, $N$, present in the mixture. This is given by the product of the amount in moles, $n$, and the Avogadro constant, $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n$$N = n N_{\\mathrm{A}}$$\n\n$2$. Next, we determine the number of label molecules that are activated and undergo the chemiluminescent reaction, denoted as $N_{reacting}$. The activation efficiency, $\\varepsilon$, is defined as the fraction of labels that react. Therefore, $N_{reacting}$ is the product of $\\varepsilon$ and the total number of labels $N$.\n$$N_{reacting} = \\varepsilon N$$\n\n$3$. Finally, we calculate the total expected photon output, $P_{total}$. The chemiluminescence quantum yield, $\\Phi$, is defined as the expected number of photons emitted per reacting label. Thus, the total photon count is the product of the number of reacting labels, $N_{reacting}$, and the quantum yield, $\\Phi$.\n$$P_{total} = \\Phi N_{reacting}$$\n\n$4$. By substituting the expressions from the previous steps, we can derive a single formula for $P_{total}$ in terms of the given parameters $n$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\Phi$, and $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$.\n$$P_{total} = \\Phi (\\varepsilon N) = \\Phi \\varepsilon (n N_{\\mathrm{A}})$$\nSo, the final analytical expression is:\n$$P_{total} = n \\varepsilon \\Phi N_{\\mathrm{A}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression:\n- $n = 25.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{mol}$\n- $\\varepsilon = 0.60$\n- $\\Phi = 0.10$\n- $N_{\\mathrm{A}} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\n$$P_{total} = (25.0 \\times 10^{-15}) \\times (0.60) \\times (0.10) \\times (6.02214076 \\times 10^{23})$$\n\nWe can perform the calculation by grouping the terms:\n$$P_{total} = (25.0 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.10) \\times (6.02214076) \\times (10^{-15} \\times 10^{23})$$\nFirst, calculate the product of the leading numbers:\n$$25.0 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.10 = 15.0 \\times 0.10 = 1.50$$\nNext, combine the powers of $10$:\n$$10^{-15} \\times 10^{23} = 10^{23-15} = 10^{8}$$\nNow, assemble the expression for $P_{total}$:\n$$P_{total} = 1.50 \\times 6.02214076 \\times 10^{8}$$\n$$P_{total} = 9.03321114 \\times 10^{8}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

At any time $t$, the conservation of antigen sites implies:\n$$ [\\mathrm{A}]_0 = [\\mathrm{A}](t) + [\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{Ab}](t) $$\nThus, the concentration of free antigen is $[\\mathrm{A}](t) = [\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{Ab}](t)$.
