Each analytical run includes two levels of internal Quality Control (QC) material measured once per run: a low-level control and a high-level control. The QC target distributions for both controls are approximately Gaussian (normal), centered at their target means with known Standard Deviations (SDs). The laboratory monitors control performance using Levey–Jennings charts and applies Westgard multirule QC to decide whether to accept or reject runs.\n\nAssume the following QC targets (expressed in $\\log_{10}$ copies per milliliter (mL)) and SDs:\n- Low control: target mean $\\mu_{L} = 2.00$, SD $\\sigma_{L} = 0.10$.\n- High control: target mean $\\mu_{H} = 5.00$, SD $\\sigma_{H} = 0.12$.\n\nFor the last $5$ consecutive runs (from run $n-4$ through the current run $n$), the laboratory recorded the following control results (all in $\\log_{10}$ copies/mL):\n- Run $n-4$: Low $= 2.07$; High $= 5.13$.\n- Run $n-3$: Low $= 2.12$; High $= 5.14$.\n- Run $n-2$: Low $= 2.09$; High $= 5.15$.\n- Run $n-1$: Low $= 2.13$; High $= 5.16$.\n- Run $n$: Low $= 2.26$; High $= 5.25$.\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- Analytical imprecision for a stable method yields control results approximately normally distributed about the true mean with SD equal to the method SD.\n- For a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, the tail areas are approximately $\\Pr(|Z| \\ge 2) \\approx 0.0455$, $\\Pr(Z \\ge 2) \\approx 0.0228$, $\\Pr(|Z| \\ge 3) \\approx 0.0027$, and $\\Pr(Z \\ge 1) \\approx 0.1587$.\n- When applying within-run multirules that compare the two control levels, random error components are assumed approximately independent between levels, whereas systematic error components affect both levels similarly.\n\nUsing these data and principles, apply Westgard multirule QC to the current run $n$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the application of Westgard multirule Quality Control (QC) procedures to a set of data from an HIV-1 RNA assay to determine the acceptability of the most recent analytical run, run $n$.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1. Extraction of Givens:**\n- **Assay:** HIV-1 RNA quantification by real-time PCR.\n- **QC Material:** Two levels, Low and High, measured once per run.\n- **QC Target Parameters ($\\log_{10}$ copies/mL):**\n    - Low control: Target mean $\\mu_{L} = 2.00$, Standard Deviation (SD) $\\sigma_{L} = 0.10$.\n    - High control: Target mean $\\mu_{H} = 5.00$, Standard Deviation (SD) $\\sigma_{H} = 0.12$.\n- **QC Data ($\\log_{10}$ copies/mL) for 5 Consecutive Runs:**\n    - Run $n-4$: Low $= 2.07$; High $= 5.13$.\n    - Run $n-3$: Low $= 2.12$; High $= 5.14$.\n    - Run $n-2$: Low $= 2.09$; High $= 5.15$.\n    - Run $n-1$: Low $= 2.13$; High $= 5.16$.\n    - Run $n$: Low $= 2.26$; High $= 5.25$.\n- **Assumptions:**\n    - Control results are approximately normally distributed.\n    - Standard normal probabilities are provided for reference.\n    - Random errors are independent between controls; systematic errors affect both.\n\n**2. Validation:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of statistical process control as applied in clinical laboratories. Westgard rules are a standard of practice. The use of $\\log_{10}$ transformation for viral load data to achieve a more Gaussian distribution is also standard. The provided parameters and results are realistic for a molecular diagnostic assay.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides all necessary information (means, SDs, and data points) to unambiguously apply the specified QC rules. A unique decision (accept or reject) based on these rules is achievable.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from subjectivity.\n\n**3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Analysis\n\nTo apply Westgard rules, each QC result must be converted to a standard score (Z-score), which measures the number of standard deviations the result is from the target mean. The formula is $Z = (x - \\mu) / \\sigma$.\n\n**Calculation of Z-Scores:**\n\n**Low Control ($\\mu_L = 2.00$, $\\sigma_L = 0.10$):**\n- Run $n-4$: $Z_L = (2.07 - 2.00) / 0.10 = +0.7$\n- Run $n-3$: $Z_L = (2.12 - 2.00) / 0.10 = +1.2$\n- Run $n-2$: $Z_L = (2.09 - 2.00) / 0.10 = +0.9$\n- Run $n-1$: $Z_L = (2.13 - 2.00) / 0.10 = +1.3$\n- Run $n$: $Z_L = (2.26 - 2.00) / 0.10 = +2.6$\n\n**High Control ($\\mu_H = 5.00$, $\\sigma_H = 0.12$):**\n- Run $n-4$: $Z_H = (5.13 - 5.00) / 0.12 = 0.13 / 0.12 \\approx +1.08$\n- Run $n-3$: $Z_H = (5.14 - 5.00) / 0.12 = 0.14 / 0.12 \\approx +1.17$\n- Run $n-2$: $Z_H = (5.15 - 5.00) / 0.12 = 0.15 / 0.12 = +1.25$\n- Run $n-1$: $Z_H = (5.16 - 5.00) / 0.12 = 0.16 / 0.12 \\approx +1.33$\n- Run $n$: $Z_H = (5.25 - 5.00) / 0.12 = 0.25 / 0.12 \\approx +2.08$\n\n**Application of Westgard Multirules to Run $n$:**\nNow we evaluate the standard set of Westgard rules using the calculated Z-scores, focusing on the decision for run $n$.\n\n- **$1_{2s}$ (Warning Rule):** One control measurement exceeds $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$.\n    - For run $n$, $Z_L = +2.6$, which is greater than $+2$. The rule is flagged.\n    - For run $n$, $Z_H \\approx +2.08$, which is greater than $+2$. The rule is flagged.\n    - **Status:** The $1_{2s}$ warning is triggered for both controls. This prompts inspection of rejection rules.\n\n- **$1_{3s}$ (Rejection Rule):** One control measurement exceeds $\\mu \\pm 3\\sigma$.\n    - For run $n$, $Z_L = +2.6$ and $Z_H \\approx +2.08$. Neither value exceeds the magnitude of $3$.\n    - **Status:** The $1_{3s}$ rule is **not violated**.\n\n- **$2_{2s}$ (Rejection Rule):** Two consecutive measurements on the same control are on the same side of the mean and exceed $\\pm 2\\sigma$, OR both control measurements in the current run are on the same side of the mean and exceed $\\pm 2\\sigma$.\n    - **Across-run:**\n        - Low control: $Z_L(n-1) = +1.3$ (not $>+2\\sigma$), $Z_L(n) = +2.6$ (is $>+2\\sigma$). Rule not violated.\n        - High control: $Z_H(n-1) \\approx +1.33$ (not $>+2\\sigma$), $Z_H(n) \\approx +2.08$ (is $>+2\\sigma$). Rule not violated.\n    - **Within-run (run $n$):**\n        - $Z_L(n) = +2.6$ (is $>+2\\sigma$).\n        - $Z_H(n) \\approx +2.08$ (is $>+2\\sigma$).\n        - Both controls are on the same side of the mean (positive) and both exceed the $+2\\sigma$ limit.\n    - **Status:** The $2_{2s}$ rule **is violated** within run $n$. This is a rejection rule. This pattern strongly suggests a systematic error (positive bias), as both controls have shifted high together.\n\n- **$R_{4s}$ (Rejection Rule):** The range between the two control measurements in a single run exceeds $4\\sigma$ (i.e., one is $>+2\\sigma$ and the other is $<-2\\sigma$, or more generally, $|Z_1 - Z_2| > 4$).\n    - For run $n$, one control is high ($Z_L = +2.6$) and the other is also high ($Z_H \\approx +2.08$). They are not on opposite sides of the mean.\n    - The difference in Z-scores is $|Z_L(n) - Z_H(n)| = |+2.6 - (+2.08)| = 0.52$. This is far less than $4$.\n    - **Status:** The $R_{4s}$ rule is **not violated**. This rule detects random error.\n\n- **$4_{1s}$ (Rejection Rule):** Four consecutive measurements on one control are on the same side of the mean and exceed $\\pm 1\\sigma$.\n    - **Low Control:** The last four Z-scores are $+1.2$ (run $n-3$), $+0.9$ (run $n-2$), $+1.3$ (run $n-1$), and $+2.6$ (run $n$). The value for run $n-2$ is $+0.9$, which does not exceed $+1\\sigma$.\n    - **High Control:** The last four Z-scores are $\\approx +1.17$ (run $n-3$), $+1.25$ (run $n-2$), $\\approx +1.33$ (run $n-1$), and $\\approx +2.08$ (run $n$). All four are on the same (positive) side of the mean, and all four exceed the $+1\\sigma$ limit.\n    - **Status:** The $4_{1s}$ rule **is violated** for the high control. This is a rejection rule and is another indicator of systematic error.\n\n- **$10_x$ (Rejection Rule):** Ten consecutive measurements on one control fall on the same side of the mean.\n    - We only have $5$ data points. For both controls, all $5$ points are on the positive side of the mean. However, we do not have enough data ($10$ points) to evaluate this rule.\n    - **Status:** The $10_x$ rule is **not violated** based on the available data.\n\n**Conclusion Summary:**\n- **Decision:** Reject the run.\n- **Violated Rejection Rules:** $2_{2s}$ and $4_{1s}$.\n- **Triggered Warning Rule:** $1_{2s}$.\n- **Error Type:** Both the $2_{2s}$ and $4_{1s}$ violations indicate a **systematic error**, specifically a positive bias in the analytical system.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Reject the run. The $1\\_2s$ warning is triggered on both controls; the $2\\_2s$ rule is violated within the current run, indicating a likely systematic positive shift; the $4\\_1s$ rule is violated across recent runs for the high control; the $1\\_3s$, $R\\_4s$, and $10\\_x$ rules are not violated.**\n- This statement is a complete and accurate summary of our findings. The run should be rejected. A $1_{2s}$ warning is present for both controls. The $2_{2s}$ (within-run) and $4_{1s}$ (high control) rejection rules are violated. The interpretation of systematic error is correct. The statement that $1_{3s}$, $R_{4s}$, and $10_x$ are not violated is also correct based on the data.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Accept the run. Only the $1\\_2s$ warning is present; no rejecting rules are violated, so the run is acceptable with caution.**\n- This is incorrect. The run must be rejected because the $2_{2s}$ and $4_{1s}$ rejection rules were violated.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Reject the run. The $1\\_3s$ rule is violated on the low control and $R\\_4s$ is violated within the current run, suggesting increased random error.**\n- This is incorrect. Neither the $1_{3s}$ rule nor the $R_{4s}$ rule was violated. The suggested error type (random) is also inconsistent with the observed pattern.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Reject the run. The $R\\_4s$ rule is violated within the current run, while other rules are in control.**\n- This is incorrect. The $R_{4s}$ rule was not violated. Furthermore, the claim that other rules are \"in control\" is false, as the $2_{2s}$ and $4_{1s}$ rules were violated.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Accept the run. All points lie within $3$ SD, and Westgard rules do not apply to $\\log_{10}$-transformed viral load data.**\n- This is incorrect. While it is true that no single point violated the $3$ SD limit (the $1_{3s}$ rule), this is not sufficient for run acceptance. The claim that Westgard rules do not apply to $\\log_{10}$-transformed data is false; this transformation is a standard practice to make the data distribution more Gaussian and thus more suitable for methods that assume normality, such as Westgard analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory receives results for a patient being evaluated for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection. The patient’s pretest probability of infection, based on epidemiologic risk assessment and local prevalence, is $0.015$. Two tests are performed sequentially and both return positive: first, a fourth-generation Human Immunodeficiency Virus antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) immunoassay, and second, a Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nucleic Acid Test (NAT). The Ag/Ab immunoassay has sensitivity $0.997$ and specificity $0.998$. The HIV-1 NAT has sensitivity $0.999$ and specificity $0.9995$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $I$ be the event that the patient is infected and $I^c$ be the event that the patient is not infected. Let $T_+$ denote a positive test result. The problem requires the derivation of the relationship between pretest odds and post-test odds.\n\nThe pretest probability of infection is $P(I)$. The pretest odds of infection are defined as the ratio of the probability of infection to the probability of non-infection:\n$$Odds_{pre} = \\frac{P(I)}{P(I^c)} = \\frac{P(I)}{1 - P(I)}$$\n\nWe are given the test's sensitivity, $S = P(T_+ | I)$, and specificity, $C = P(T_- | I^c)$, where $T_-$ is a negative test result. From the definition of specificity, the probability of a positive test in an uninfected individual (the false positive rate) is $P(T_+ | I^c) = 1 - P(T_- | I^c) = 1 - C$.\n\nThe post-test probability, $P(I | T_+)$, is the probability of infection given a positive test result. According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(I | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+)}$$\nUsing the law of total probability, the denominator can be expanded:\n$$P(T_+) = P(T_+ | I) P(I) + P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)$$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$P(I | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+ | I) P(I) + P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)}$$\n\nThe post-test odds of infection are analogously defined as:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{P(I | T_+)}{P(I^c | T_+)}$$\nWe can find an expression for $P(I^c | T_+)$ using Bayes' theorem as well:\n$$P(I^c | T_+) = \\frac{P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)}{P(T_+)}$$\nForming the ratio for the post-test odds, the common denominator $P(T_+)$ cancels:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{P(T_+ | I) P(I)}{P(T_+ | I^c) P(I^c)} = \\left( \\frac{P(T_+ | I)}{P(T_+ | I^c)} \\right) \\left( \\frac{P(I)}{P(I^c)} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and pretest odds, we get:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\left( \\frac{S}{1 - C} \\right) Odds_{pre}$$\nThe term $\\frac{S}{1-C}$ is the Positive Likelihood Ratio, denoted $LR_+$. Thus, the rule for updating odds is $Odds_{post} = LR_+ \\cdot Odds_{pre}$. This completes the required derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we apply this result to the given problem. The process is sequential. The post-test odds after the first test become the pretest odds for the second test.\n\nInitial pretest probability: $P_{pre}(I) = 0.015$.\nInitial pretest odds:\n$$Odds_0 = \\frac{P_{pre}(I)}{1 - P_{pre}(I)} = \\frac{0.015}{1 - 0.015} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985}$$\n\nFor Test 1 (Ag/Ab immunoassay):\n-   Sensitivity: $S_1 = 0.997$\n-   Specificity: $C_1 = 0.998$\n-   False Positive Rate: $1 - C_1 = 1 - 0.998 = 0.002$\n-   Positive Likelihood Ratio: $LR_{1,+} = \\frac{S_1}{1 - C_1} = \\frac{0.997}{0.002} = 498.5$\n\nThe odds after the first positive test ($T_{1,+}$) are:\n$$Odds_1 = LR_{1,+} \\cdot Odds_0 = \\left( \\frac{0.997}{0.002} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.015}{0.985} \\right)$$\nThis $Odds_1$ serves as the pretest odds for the second test.\n\nFor Test 2 (NAT):\n-   Sensitivity: $S_2 = 0.999$\n-   Specificity: $C_2 = 0.9995$\n-   False Positive Rate: $1 - C_2 = 1 - 0.9995 = 0.0005$\n-   Positive Likelihood Ratio: $LR_{2,+} = \\frac{S_2}{1 - C_2} = \\frac{0.999}{0.0005} = 1998$\n\nThe final odds after the second positive test ($T_{2,+}$) are:\n$$Odds_{final} = LR_{2,+} \\cdot Odds_1 = LR_{2,+} \\cdot LR_{1,+} \\cdot Odds_0$$\nThis is valid due to the stated conditional independence of the tests.\n$$Odds_{final} = \\left( \\frac{0.999}{0.0005} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.997}{0.002} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.015}{0.985} \\right)$$\n$$Odds_{final} = (1998) (498.5) \\left( \\frac{0.015}{0.985} \\right) = 996003 \\left( \\frac{0.015}{0.985} \\right)$$\n$$Odds_{final} = \\frac{14940.045}{0.985} \\approx 15167.5583756$$\n\nFinally, we convert the final odds back to a probability, $P_{final}$.

By deriving the conditions for this effect from first principles of chemical binding, you will gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of sandwich ELISAs .

In a suspected early acute infection with very high antigen load, an undiluted plasma sample returns a nonreactive p24 result despite strong clinical suspicion. The laboratory scientist hypothesizes a prozone (hook) effect, where excess antigen prevents formation of the capture–antigen–detection sandwich complex that the assay relies on for signal generation.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action for reversible binding between antigen and antibodies, and the core definition of dissociation constant, derive a condition in terms of antigen concentration under which the prozone effect would suppress the assay signal (i.e., the detection antibody is predominantly occupied by free antigen and cannot bind to captured antigen to form a sandwich complex). Then, translate the condition into a minimal dilution factor that ensures the diluted sample falls back into a concentration regime where the sandwich complex can form robustly.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible parameters for this assay and sample:\n- The detection antibody–antigen dissociation constant is $K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{nM}$.\n- The assay requires at least a fraction $t = 0.05$ of detection antibody to remain unbound by free antigen in solution to achieve a reliable signal upon exposure to captured antigen.\n- The p24 antigen molecular mass is $M_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 24{,}000$ $\\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n- The undiluted plasma p24 mass concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 1.0$ $\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nIn addition to the derivation, outline a serial dilution protocol that a laboratory scientist could use to both detect and correct for the prozone artifact in practice, specifying how the progressive dilutions would be interpreted and how the final reported concentration should be calculated if a diluted specimen yields a valid signal.\n\nFinally, compute the minimal dilution factor $F$ that would reduce the antigen concentration below the prozone-suppressing regime you derived.

By mass balance:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ab}]_{\\mathrm{det,total}} = [\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}] + [\\mathrm{Ag-Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]\n$$\nThe assay requires a fraction, $t$, of the detection antibody to remain free (unbound) to be available for binding to the captured antigen on the solid phase. Prozone-induced signal suppression occurs when the fraction of free detection antibody falls below this threshold:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]}{[\\mathrm{Ab}]_{\\mathrm{det,total}}} < t\n$$\nTo express this condition in terms of antigen concentration, we first rearrange the dissociation constant equation to solve for $[\\mathrm{Ag-Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag-Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}] [\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the mass balance equation for the antibody:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ab}]_{\\mathrm{det,total}} = [\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}] [\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}} = [\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}] \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe fraction of free detection antibody is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]}{[\\mathrm{Ab}]_{\\mathrm{det,total}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}]}{[\\mathrm{Ab}_{\\mathrm{det}}] \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}}\n$$\nThe condition for signal suppression becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}} < t\n$$\nSolving this inequality for $[\\mathrm{Ag}]$:\n$$\n1 < t \\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t} < 1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t} - 1 < \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1-t}{t} < \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]}{K_{D,\\mathrm{det}}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}] > K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} \\frac{1-t}{t}\n$$\nIn a high-dose hook effect scenario, the antigen concentration is in vast excess of the antibody concentration. Thus, the concentration of free antigen, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]$, is approximately equal to the total antigen concentration in the sample, which we will call $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{sample}}$. Therefore, the prozone effect occurs when the antigen concentration in the sample exceeds a critical threshold, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{sample}} > [\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} \\frac{1-t}{t}\n$$\n\nNext, we outline a laboratory protocol for diagnosing and correcting the prozone effect.\nWhen a sample with strong clinical suspicion for a condition (e.g., acute HIV infection) yields a negative or nonreactive result in a sandwich immunoassay, a prozone effect should be suspected.\n1.  **Procedure:** The laboratory scientist should perform a serial dilution of the original patient plasma sample. A common and effective dilution series is $1:10$, $1:100$, and $1:1000$. These dilutions are typically made using the assay-specific diluent buffer. Each diluted sample, along with the neat (undiluted) sample, is then re-assayed.\n2.  **Interpretation:** The results from the diluted samples are interpreted as follows:\n    *   If all dilutions and the neat sample remain nonreactive, the original result is confirmed as a true negative.\n    *   If one or more of the dilutions become reactive (positive), the prozone effect is confirmed. Typically, the signal (e.g., optical density) will increase as the sample is diluted from neat to $1:10$ or $1:100$, and then will decrease at higher dilutions ($1:1000$) as the antigen concentration falls below the assay's lower limit of detection.\n3.  **Quantification:** To report a final quantitative result, the scientist must select the dilution that provides a signal within the assay's quantifiable range (i.e., between the lower and upper limits of quantification, LLOQ and ULOQ). The concentration value obtained from the assay's calibration curve for this dilution, $c_{\\mathrm{measured}}$, is then multiplied by the dilution factor to determine the concentration in the original sample, $c_{\\mathrm{final}}$. For instance, if the $1:100$ dilution yields a measured concentration of $c_{\\mathrm{measured}}$, the final reported concentration is $c_{\\mathrm{final}} = c_{\\mathrm{measured}} \\times 100$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal dilution factor, $F$, required to bring the sample concentration below the prozone-suppressing regime.\nFirst, we convert the mass concentration of p24 in the undiluted plasma, $c_{\\mathrm{p24}}$, to a molar concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}$.\nGiven: $c_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 1.0 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 24{,}000 \\, \\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{p24}} = 1.0 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 1.0 \\, \\frac{10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{g}}{10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{L}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}} = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{p24}}}{M_{\\mathrm{p24}}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{L}}{24{,}000 \\, \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mol}} = \\frac{1.0}{24 \\times 10^3 \\times 10^3} \\, \\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L} = \\frac{1}{24} \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{mol}/\\mathrm{L}\n$$\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}} \\approx 4.1667 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{M} = 41.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the critical antigen concentration, $[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, using the derived formula and the given parameters $K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} = 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}$ and $t=0.05$.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}} = K_{D,\\mathrm{det}} \\frac{1-t}{t} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\frac{1 - 0.05}{0.05} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM}) \\frac{0.95}{0.05} = (2.0 \\, \\mathrm{nM})(19) = 38 \\, \\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nThe minimal dilution factor $F$ is a factor that reduces the sample concentration to be at or below this critical value:\n$$\n\\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{F} \\le [\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}\n$$\nThus, the minimal dilution factor $F$ is:\n$$\nF \\ge \\frac{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{plasma}}}{[\\mathrm{Ag}]_{\\mathrm{crit}}}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{41.667 \\, \\mathrm{nM}}{38 \\, \\mathrm{nM}} \\approx 1.0965\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the minimal dilution factor is $F = 1.10$. This means even a slight dilution is sufficient to begin to alleviate the hook effect under these specific conditions. For example, a $1:2$ dilution would be more than adequate.",
