The assay monitors the increase in absorbance at $340$ nm due to NADH formation. The stoichiometry of the reaction is $1:1$ between BHB and NADH.

The procedure described is a standard method in clinical diagnostics.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the Limit of Detection (LOD) for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentration in the original plasma sample. The problem defines the LOD as the analyte concentration that yields a signal equal to $3$ times the standard deviation of the blank signal. In this spectrophotometric assay, the signal is the change in absorbance, $\\Delta A$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the standard deviation of the $n=10$ reagent blank absorbance measurements, denoted as $s_{\\text{blank}}$. The given absorbance values ($A_i$) are:\n$0.00015$, $0.00010$, $0.00012$, $0.00014$, $0.00009$, $0.00011$, $0.00013$, $0.00012$, $0.00008$, $0.00011$.\n\nThe mean of the blank absorbances, $\\bar{A}_{\\text{blank}}$, is:\n$$\n\\bar{A}_{\\text{blank}} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i = \\frac{1}{10} (0.00015 + 0.00010 + \\dots + 0.00011) = \\frac{0.00115}{10} = 0.000115\n$$\n\nThe sample standard deviation, $s_{\\text{blank}}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$\ns_{\\text{blank}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - \\bar{A}_{\\text{blank}})^2}\n$$\nThe sum of squared differences is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (A_i - \\bar{A}_{\\text{blank}})^2 = (0.00015 - 0.000115)^2 + \\dots + (0.00011 - 0.000115)^2 \\approx 4.25 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the standard deviation formula:\n$$\ns_{\\text{blank}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.25 \\times 10^{-9}}{10-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.25 \\times 10^{-9}}{9}} \\approx 2.17306 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, the minimum detectable absorbance change, $A_{\\text{LOD}}$, is $3$ times this standard deviation:\n$$\nA_{\\text{LOD}} = 3 \\times s_{\\text{blank}} = 3 \\times (2.17306 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 6.51918 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n\nNext, we use the Beer–Lambert law, $A = \\varepsilon c l$, to find the concentration of NADH in the cuvette, $C_{\\text{NADH, cuvette}}$, that corresponds to this absorbance.\n$$\nA_{\\text{LOD}} = \\varepsilon \\cdot C_{\\text{NADH, cuvette}} \\cdot l\n$$\nSolving for $C_{\\text{NADH, cuvette}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{NADH, cuvette}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{LOD}}}{\\varepsilon \\cdot l}\n$$\nWe are given $\\varepsilon = 6.22 \\times 10^{3}$ L mol$^{-1}$ cm$^{-1}$ and $l = 1.00$ cm.\n$$\nC_{\\text{NADH, cuvette}} = \\frac{6.51918 \\times 10^{-5}}{(6.22 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ L mol}^{-1} \\text{cm}^{-1}) \\cdot (1.00 \\text{ cm})} \\approx 1.048099 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe reaction stoichiometry between BHB and NADH is $1:1$.

The concentration of BHB in the original sample, $C_{\\text{BHB, sample}}$, can be found by accounting for this dilution. The number of moles of BHB is conserved:\n$$\nC_{\\text{BHB, sample}} \\cdot V_{\\text{sample}} = C_{\\text{BHB, cuvette}} \\cdot V_{\\text{total}}\n$$\nSolving for the original sample concentration, which is our LOD:\n$$\nC_{\\text{LOD}} = C_{\\text{BHB, sample}} = C_{\\text{BHB, cuvette}} \\cdot \\frac{V_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}}\n$$\nFirst, we ensure the volumes are in consistent units.\n$V_{\\text{total}} = 1.000 \\text{ mL}$\n$V_{\\text{sample}} = 20.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{L} = 0.0200 \\text{ mL}$\nThe dilution factor is:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{sample}}} = \\frac{1.000 \\text{ mL}}{0.0200 \\text{ mL}} = 50.0\n$$\nNow, we calculate $C_{\\text{LOD}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{LOD}} = (1.048099 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}) \\times 50.0 \\approx 5.240495 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ mol L}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be in mmol/L.
