It provides all necessary data and definitions to perform the required unit conversion for a blood glucose measurement. The values are physically realistic and relevant to clinical chemistry. Therefore, the problem is valid and can be solved by applying first principles of chemistry.\n\nThe objective is to convert a mass concentration ($c_{m}$) of glucose into a substance amount concentration ($c_{n}$). The fundamental definitions provided are:\n$c_{m} = \\frac{m}{V}$\n$c_{n} = \\frac{n}{V}$\nwhere $m$ is mass, $V$ is volume, and $n$ is the amount of substance. The relationship between these quantities is given by the definition of molar mass, $M$:\n$n = \\frac{m}{M}$\n\nBy substituting the expression for $n$ into the equation for $c_{n}$, we can establish a direct relationship between amount concentration and mass concentration:\n$c_{n} = \\frac{(m/M)}{V} = \\frac{m}{V \\cdot M} = \\frac{1}{M} \\left(\\frac{m}{V}\\right)$\nRecognizing that $c_{m} = m/V$, we arrive at the core conversion formula:\n$c_{n} = \\frac{c_{m}}{M}$\n\nTo use this formula, we must first calculate the molar mass of glucose ($\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{12}\\text{O}_6$) using the provided atomic masses: $M_{\\mathrm{C}} = 12.011\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.008\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{glucose}} = 6 \\times M_{\\mathrm{C}} + 12 \\times M_{\\mathrm{H}} + 6 \\times M_{\\mathrm{O}}$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{glucose}} = 6 \\times (12.011\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}) + 12 \\times (1.008\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}) + 6 \\times (15.999\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}})$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{glucose}} = 72.066\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 12.096\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}} + 95.994\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n$$M_{\\mathrm{glucose}} = 180.156\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nThe given mass concentration is $c_{m, \\mathrm{given}} = 126\\,\\mathrm{mg\\,dL^{-1}}$.

The Beer–Lambert law is the fundamental principle of spectrophotometry. The use of a two-point calibration to correct for a constant blank absorbance is a standard laboratory practice. The given absorbance values and concentrations are physically realistic for such an assay. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two distinct points (calibrators) which are sufficient to uniquely define a straight line. It then provides an absorbance value for an unknown sample that lies within the range of the calibrators, ensuring the result is obtained by interpolation, which is a stable and well-defined procedure. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unambiguous language.

Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem states that a linear calibration model relates the measured absorbance $A$ to the glucose concentration $C$. This relationship arises from the Beer–Lambert law, $A_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\varepsilon l C$, where $A_{\\mathrm{true}}$ is the absorbance due solely to the analyte, $\\varepsilon$ is the molar absorptivity, and $l$ is the optical path length. The presence of an additive reagent blank, $A_{\\mathrm{blank}}$, modifies this relationship to $A = A_{\\mathrm{true}} + A_{\\mathrm{blank}}$. Combining these gives:\n$$A = (\\varepsilon l) C + A_{\\mathrm{blank}}$$\nThis is a linear equation of the form $A = mC + b$, where the slope $m = \\varepsilon l$ represents the sensitivity of the assay, and the y-intercept $b = A_{\\mathrm{blank}}$ represents the constant absorbance of the reagent blank.\n\nTo determine the parameters $m$ and $b$, we use the two provided calibrators, which give two points on the calibration line: $(C_1, A_1)$ and $(C_2, A_2)$.\nPoint $1$: $(C_1, A_1) = (80, 0.324)$\nPoint $2$: $(C_2, A_2) = (160, 0.632)$\n\nWe can write a system of two linear equations:\n$1$. $A_1 = mC_1 + b$\n$2$. $A_2 = mC_2 + b$\n\nThe slope $m$ is the change in absorbance divided by the change in concentration:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta A}{\\Delta C} = \\frac{A_2 - A_1}{C_2 - C_1}$$\nSubstituting the given values for the calibrators:\n$$m = \\frac{0.632 - 0.324}{160 - 80} = \\frac{0.308}{80} = 0.00385$$\nThe units of the slope are $(\\mathrm{mg/dL})^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we determine the intercept $b$ by rearranging one of the calibration equations, for instance, the first one:\n$$b = A_1 - mC_1$$\nSubstituting the values for calibrator $1$ and the calculated slope:\n$$b = 0.324 - (0.00385) \\times (80)$$\n$$b = 0.324 - 0.308 = 0.016$$\nThe intercept represents the absorbance when the glucose concentration is zero, which is the reagent blank absorbance.\n\nThe complete calibration equation is therefore:\n$$A = 0.00385C + 0.016$$\n\nTo find the concentration of the unknown sample, $C_{\\mathrm{unk}}$, we rearrange the calibration equation to solve for $C$:\n$$A - b = mC$$\n$$C = \\frac{A - b}{m}$$\nWe substitute the measured absorbance of the unknown sample, $A_{\\mathrm{unk}} = 0.420$, and the calculated parameters $m$ and $b$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{unk}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{unk}} - b}{m} = \\frac{0.420 - 0.016}{0.00385}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{unk}} = \\frac{0.404}{0.00385} \\approx 104.9350649...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $4$, and $9$.
