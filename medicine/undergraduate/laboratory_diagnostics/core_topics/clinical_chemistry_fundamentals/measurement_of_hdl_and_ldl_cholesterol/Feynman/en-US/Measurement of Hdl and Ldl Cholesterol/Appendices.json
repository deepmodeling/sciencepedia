            "problem": "A fasting adult patient's serum lipids are measured by standard enzymatic assays in a clinical laboratory. The Total Cholesterol ($TC$) is $220$ mg/dL, High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ($HDL\\text{-}C$) is $40$ mg/dL, and Triglycerides ($TG$) are $150$ mg/dL. In a fasting sample without chylomicrons, the total cholesterol in serum is the sum of cholesterol carried by the major lipoprotein classes, and, over the range $TG<400$ mg/dL, the cholesterol content of Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ($VLDL\\text{-}C$) follows a well-established empirical proportionality to triglycerides by mass.\n\nUsing these foundational facts, compute the Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ($LDL\\text{-}C$) for this patient by mass balance and the empirical proportionality that underlies the Friedewald estimation.

The relationship between total cholesterol, its lipoprotein fractions, and triglycerides is a fundamental concept in lipid metabolism. The Friedewald equation is a standard, universally accepted method for estimating $LDL\\text{-}C$ under the specified conditions. The given values are clinically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient data ($TC$, $HDL\\text{-}C$, $TG$) and a clear methodology (mass balance and the empirical rule of the Friedewald estimation) to calculate a unique value for $LDL\\text{-}C$. The condition for the validity of the estimation, $TG < 400$ mg/dL, is explicitly stated and met by the data ($150 < 400$). The \"empirical proportionality\" is unambiguously understood in this context to be the standard factor used in the Friedewald formula.\n- **Objective**: The problem is objective, using precise numerical data and established clinical guidelines. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard, well-defined calculation in clinical diagnostics. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ($LDL\\text{-}C$) using the Friedewald estimation, a method based on the mass balance of cholesterol components in serum.\n\nThe fundamental principle, as stated in the problem, is that the Total Cholesterol ($TC$) in a fasting sample is composed of the cholesterol carried by the three major lipoprotein fractions: High-Density Lipoprotein ($HDL$), Low-Density Lipoprotein ($LDL$), and Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein ($VLDL$). This can be expressed as an equation:\n$$\nTC = HDL\\text{-}C + LDL\\text{-}C + VLDL\\text{-}C\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the cholesterol content of $VLDL$ ($VLDL\\text{-}C$) can be estimated from the Triglycerides ($TG$) concentration. The well-established empirical relationship that forms the basis of the Friedewald estimation (for concentrations in mg/dL) is that the mass of $VLDL\\text{-}C$ is approximately one-fifth of the mass of Triglycerides. This is based on the average composition of VLDL particles in a fasting state.\n$$\nVLDL\\text{-}C \\approx \\frac{TG}{5}\n$$\nThis estimation is valid under the condition that $TG < 400$ mg/dL, which is met in this case since the patient's $TG$ is $150$ mg/dL.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $VLDL\\text{-}C$ concentration using the given $TG$ value:\n$$\nVLDL\\text{-}C = \\frac{150 \\text{ mg/dL}}{5} = 30 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\nNext, we rearrange the mass balance equation to solve for $LDL\\text{-}C$:\n$$\nLDL\\text{-}C = TC - HDL\\text{-}C - VLDL\\text{-}C\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values for $TC$ and $HDL\\text{-}C$, and our calculated value for $VLDL\\text{-}C$:\n$$\nLDL\\text{-}C = 220 \\text{ mg/dL} - 40 \\text{ mg/dL} - 30 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\nPerforming the subtraction:\n$$\nLDL\\text{-}C = 180 \\text{ mg/dL} - 30 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\n$$\nLDL\\text{-}C = 150 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported to four significant figures. The calculated value of $150$ is presented as $150.0$ to meet this requirement.\n$$\nLDL\\text{-}C = 150.0 \\text{ mg/dL}\n$$\nFinally, we classify this result using the provided NCEP ATP III thresholds. The calculated $LDL\\text{-}C$ value is $150.0$ mg/dL. This value falls within the range $130 \\leq LDL\\text{-}C \\leq 159$ mg/dL, which is defined as \"borderline high\". Therefore, the patient's $LDL\\text{-}C$ level is classified as borderline high.",

            "introduction": "The accuracy of any calculated value, like the LDL-C from the Friedewald equation, depends entirely on the accuracy of its input measurements. This practice problem  delves into a real-world analytical challenge: systematic error, or bias, in High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) measurement.

            "problem": "A laboratory uses a precipitation-based method for measuring High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C), where apolipoprotein B-containing particles (for example, Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), Very-Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), intermediate-density lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a)) are selectively precipitated, and the supernatant is assayed enzymatically for cholesterol. Consider a specimen with non-High-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) concentration of $180\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Due to incomplete precipitation, suppose that a fixed fraction of the non-HDL-C, specifically $1\\%$, remains unprecipitated in the supernatant.

Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the measurement bias in High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) due to incomplete precipitation of non-HDL cholesterol components. The derivation must proceed from first principles.\n\nLet $C_{HDL,true}$ represent the true concentration of HDL-C in the specimen. Let $C_{non-HDL}$ represent the concentration of all non-HDL cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. The total cholesterol concentration, $C_{total}$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$C_{total} = C_{HDL,true} + C_{non-HDL}$$\n\nThe described laboratory method aims to isolate HDL-C by precipitating all non-HDL components. In an ideal scenario, the precipitate would contain all the non-HDL lipoproteins, and the supernatant would contain only the HDL lipoproteins. An enzymatic assay for cholesterol performed on this ideal supernatant would yield the true HDL-C concentration, $C_{HDL,true}$.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the precipitation is incomplete. A fixed fraction, let's call it $f$, of the non-HDL-C remains in the supernatant. The problem specifies that this fraction is $f = 1\\%$, which is numerically equivalent to $f = 0.01$. It is also given that the precipitation process does not remove any HDL-C.\n\nTherefore, the supernatant, which is subsequently assayed, contains two cholesterol components:\n$1$. The entire amount of the true HDL-C, with concentration $C_{HDL,true}$.\n$2$. A contaminating amount of unprecipitated non-HDL-C. The concentration of this contaminant is the fraction $f$ multiplied by the initial non-HDL-C concentration, which is $f \\times C_{non-HDL}$.\n\nThe enzymatic assay measures the total cholesterol present in this supernatant. Let this measured value be denoted as $C_{HDL,measured}$. Since the assay detects all cholesterol with equal response, the measured concentration is the sum of the concentrations of the cholesterol from both sources:\n$$C_{HDL,measured} = C_{HDL,true} + (f \\times C_{non-HDL})$$\n\nThe problem defines measurement bias as the difference between the measured quantity and the true quantity, arising from systematic error. The bias in the HDL-C measurement is therefore:\n$$\\text{Bias} = C_{HDL,measured} - C_{HDL,true}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{HDL,measured}$ into the bias equation gives:\n$$\\text{Bias} = (C_{HDL,true} + f \\times C_{non-HDL}) - C_{HDL,true}$$\n\nSimplifying this expression, the $C_{HDL,true}$ terms cancel out, leaving the bias caused solely by the contamination:\n$$\\text{Bias} = f \\times C_{non-HDL}$$\nThis result confirms that the bias is positive, meaning the measurement systematically overestimates the true HDL-C value.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical values required for the calculation:\nThe concentration of non-HDL-C is $C_{non-HDL} = 180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\nThe fraction of unprecipitated non-HDL-C is $f = 1\\% = 0.01$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for the bias:\n$$\\text{Bias} = 0.01 \\times 180 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$$\n$$\\text{Bias} = 1.8 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $1.8$ has two significant figures. To express it with three significant figures, we write it as $1.80$. The final answer for the positive bias is $1.80 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.",

            "problem": "A fasting serum sample is analyzed on a well-calibrated clinical chemistry platform to measure Total Cholesterol (TC), High-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and Triglycerides (TG). Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is estimated using the Friedewald relationship, which expresses the LDL-C estimator as a linear combination of the directly measured analytes.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the standard uncertainty for an estimated quantity, Low-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), based on the measured uncertainties of three independent analytes: Total Cholesterol (TC), High-Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and Triglycerides (TG). This is a direct application of the law of propagation of uncertainty.\n\nLet the estimated LDL-C be denoted by the variable $L$, the measured TC by $T$, the measured HDL-C by $H$, and the measured TG by $G$. The problem states that $L$ is estimated using the Friedewald relationship. This well-established formula in clinical chemistry, for concentrations expressed in mg/dL, is:\n$$L = T - H - \\frac{G}{5}$$\nThis is a linear combination of the measured variables $T$, $H$, and $G$.\n\nThe general formula for the propagation of uncertainty for a function $L(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ is given by the variance, $\\sigma_L^2$:\n$$\\sigma_L^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{x_i}^2 + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\sum_{j=i+1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_i}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x_j}\\right) \\sigma_{x_i, x_j}$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{x_i}^2$ is the variance of the variable $x_i$ and $\\sigma_{x_i, x_j}$ is the\ncovariance between $x_i$ and $x_j$.\n\nThe problem states that the measurement errors in TC, HDL-C, and TG are independent. Under this assumption, all covariance terms are zero ($\\sigma_{T,H} = \\sigma_{T,G} = \\sigma_{H,G} = 0$). The formula for the variance of $L$ simplifies to:\n$$\\sigma_L^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial T}\\right)^2 \\sigma_T^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial H}\\right)^2 \\sigma_H^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial G}\\right)^2 \\sigma_G^2$$\nHere, $\\sigma_T$, $\\sigma_H$, and $\\sigma_G$ are the standard uncertainties (standard deviations) of TC, HDL-C, and TG, respectively, and $\\sigma_L$ is the standard uncertainty of LDL-C.\n\nWe first compute the partial derivatives of the function $L(T, H, G) = T - H - \\frac{1}{5}G$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial T} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial H} = -1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial G} = -\\frac{1}{5} $$\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the simplified variance formula, we derive the expression for the variance of the LDL-C estimate:\n$$ \\sigma_L^2 = (1)^2 \\sigma_T^2 + (-1)^2 \\sigma_H^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{5}\\right)^2 \\sigma_G^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_L^2 = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_H^2 + \\frac{1}{25}\\sigma_G^2 $$\nThis equation expresses the variance of the calculated LDL-C as a sum of the variances of the measured components, each weighted by the square of its coefficient in the linear Friedewald equation.\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values for the standard uncertainties:\n- $\\sigma_T = 3.0$ mg/dL\n- $\\sigma_H = 1.2$ mg/dL\n- $\\sigma_G = 8.5$ mg/dL\n\nThe corresponding variances are:\n- $\\sigma_T^2 = (3.0)^2 = 9.0$ (mg/dL)$^2$\n- $\\sigma_H^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44$ (mg/dL)$^2$\n- $\\sigma_G^2 = (8.5)^2 = 72.25$ (mg/dL)$^2$\n\nNow we can calculate the total variance of the LDL-C estimate, $\\sigma_L^2$.

The largest contribution is $9.0$ (mg/dL)$^2$, which comes from the Total Cholesterol measurement.\n\nThe fractional contributions of each source to the combined variance $\\sigma_L^2 = 13.33$ (mg/dL)$^2$ are:\n- Fractional contribution from TC: $\\frac{9.0}{13.33} \\approx 0.6752$ or $67.5\\%$\n- Fractional contribution from HDL-C: $\\frac{1.44}{13.33} \\approx 0.1080$ or $10.8\\%$\n- Fractional contribution from TG: $\\frac{2.89}{13.33} \\approx 0.2168$ or $21.7\\%$\n\nThe sum of these fractions is approximately $1$, confirming the calculation. Clearly, the uncertainty in Total Cholesterol is the dominant source of uncertainty in the estimated LDL-C, contributing $67.5\\%$ of the total variance.",
