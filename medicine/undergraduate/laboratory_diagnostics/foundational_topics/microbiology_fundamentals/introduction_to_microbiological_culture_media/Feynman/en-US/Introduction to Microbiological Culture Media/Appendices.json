            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a problem regarding the preparation of a microbiological culture medium, accounting for volume loss during sterilization.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Final ready-to-use medium concentration, $C_f$: $52\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$\n- Final volume of medium, $V_f$: $2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- Evaporation loss during sterilization: $3\\%$ of the pre-sterilization volume.\n- Solutes in the dehydrated medium are nonvolatile.\n- Volume change is due only to water loss.\n- The mass of dehydrated medium powder, $m$, must be determined.\n- The final answer must be rounded to four significant figures and expressed in grams.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria.\n\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard laboratory procedure (media preparation with autoclaving) and is based on the fundamental principles of mass conservation and the definition of concentration. The values provided are realistic for a microbiology lab. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: All necessary information to determine the mass of the solute is provided. The final target state (concentration and volume) is clearly defined. A unique, stable solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language and established scientific terms. It is free of ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or unrealistic conditions. The inclusion of the evaporation loss percentage, while not directly necessary for the final mass calculation, is relevant to the full practical procedure and serves to test a complete understanding of the physical process, preventing it from being trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full, reasoned solution.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine the mass of dehydrated medium powder, which we will denote as $m$, required to produce a final, sterile medium with specified properties.\n\nLet us define the variables for the initial (pre-sterilization) and final (post-sterilization) states of the medium.\n- Let $m$ be the mass of the nonvolatile solute (the dehydrated medium powder).\n- Let $V_i$ and $C_i$ be the volume and concentration of the medium before sterilization, respectively.\n- Let $V_f$ and $C_f$ be the volume and concentration of the medium after sterilization.\n\nThe problem provides the desired final state parameters:\n- Final concentration, $C_f = 52\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$\n- Final volume, $V_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe core principles to be used are the definition of concentration and the conservation of mass.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass**: The problem states that the solutes in the dehydrated medium are nonvolatile. This means that during steam sterilization, only water evaporates; the mass of the solute, $m$, remains constant throughout the process. Therefore, the mass of powder weighed initially is the same mass present in the final solution.\n\n2.  **Definition of Concentration**: Concentration ($C$) is defined as the mass of solute ($m$) per unit volume of solution ($V$):\n    $$C = \\frac{m}{V}$$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the mass $m$ that must be weighed. Since this mass is conserved, we can calculate it directly from the properties of the final solution, which are explicitly given. Applying the definition of concentration to the final state:\n$$C_f = \\frac{m}{V_f}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the mass $m$:\n$$m = C_f \\times V_f$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this equation:\n$$m = (52\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}) \\times (2.5\\,\\mathrm{L})$$\n$$m = 130\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\nThe problem also provides the evaporation loss, which is $3\\%$ of the pre-sterilization volume. While this information is not needed to calculate the mass $m$, it is crucial for determining the correct initial volume of solvent to use. To demonstrate a full understanding of the process, let us calculate the required initial volume, $V_i$.\n\nThe final volume $V_f$ is the initial volume $V_i$ minus the volume lost to evaporation:\n$$V_f = V_i - (0.03 \\times V_i)$$\n$$V_f = V_i (1 - 0.03)$$\n$$V_f = 0.97 \\times V_i$$\nSolving for the initial volume $V_i$:\n$$V_i = \\frac{V_f}{0.97} = \\frac{2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}}{0.97} \\approx 2.577319...\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nThus, to prepare the medium, one would weigh out the calculated mass $m=130\\,\\mathrm{g}$ and dissolve it in purified water, bringing the total volume to approximately $2.577\\,\\mathrm{L}$. Upon sterilization, the volume would decrease to the target $2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$, and the concentration would be correct: $\\frac{130\\,\\mathrm{g}}{2.5\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 52\\,\\mathrm{g\\,L^{-1}}$. This confirms the consistency of the problem data and the correctness of our approach.\n\nThe question, however, strictly asks for the mass of the dehydrated medium. The calculation $m = C_f \\times V_f$ is sufficient and correct.\n\nThe calculated mass is $m = 130\\,\\mathrm{g}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $130$ with four significant figures, we write it as $130.0$.",
