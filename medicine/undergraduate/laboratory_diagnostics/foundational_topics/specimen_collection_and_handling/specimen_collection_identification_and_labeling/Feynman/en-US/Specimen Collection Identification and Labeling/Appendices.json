This exercise demonstrates the critical importance of specimen integrity by quantifying the impact of hemolysis—the rupture of red blood cells. By calculating the change in potassium concentration from a seemingly small amount of cell lysis, you will gain a tangible appreciation for why gentle handling techniques are essential to prevent clinically misleading results for analytes that have a large concentration gradient across the cell membrane .",

            "solution": "### Part 1: Probability of a Correctly Labeled Specimen\n\nLet $p$ be the probability of a mislabel at a single handoff, so $p = 0.005$.\nLet $n$ be the number of handoffs, so $n=5$.\n\nThe probability of a specimen being correctly labeled at a single handoff is the complement of a mislabel event:\n$$ P(\\text{correct at one handoff}) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995 $$\n\nFor the specimen to be correctly labeled at the end of the entire workflow, it must be correctly labeled at every one of the $n=5$ independent handoffs. The probability of this compound event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ P(\\text{correct final label}) = (1 - p)^n = (0.995)^5 $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ (0.995)^5 = 0.97524875621875 $$\nRounding to $6$ significant figures, we get $0.975249$.\n\n### Part 2: Proposed Systemic Change\n\n**Proposal:** Implement an independent double-check at each of the $n$ handoffs. A persistent error is logged at a stage only if the initial action is an error *and* the independent verification step also fails to detect it.\n\n**Mathematical Model:**\nLet $p$ be the probability of error for any single action (the original handoff or the new verification step). In the original model, the per-stage error probability is $p$.\n\nIn the new system, for a persistent error to be introduced at stage $i$, two independent failures must occur:\n1.  An error is made in the primary handoff action (probability $p$).\n2.  The independent verification step also fails (also with probability $p$).\n\nThe new effective probability of a persistent error at any single stage, $p_{\\text{eff}}$, is the product of these independent probabilities:\n$$ p_{\\text{eff}} = p \\times p = p^2 $$\nThe overall probability of a correctly labeled specimen in this improved workflow, $P'_{\\text{success}}$, is:\n$$ P'_{\\text{success}} = (1 - p_{\\text{eff}})^n = (1 - p^2)^n $$\n**Quantified Improvement:**\nWe can prove that this new system is more reliable. Since $p$ is a probability between $0$ and $1$ (specifically, $p=0.005$), it is mathematically true that $p^2  p$.\nThis implies that $1 - p^2 > 1 - p$.\nBecause both bases are positive numbers, raising them to a positive power $n$ preserves the inequality:\n$$ (1 - p^2)^n > (1 - p)^n $$\n$$ P'_{\\text{success}} > P_{\\text{success}} $$\nThis demonstrates that the systemic change guarantees a higher overall reliability by reducing the per-stage error rate from $p$ to $p^2$.",
