This exercise delves into the hidden danger of static electricity, a frequent culprit in fires involving flammable solvents. You will apply fundamental principles of electrostatics to quantify the energy ($E$) of a static discharge from its capacitance ($C$) and voltage ($V$) and compare it to the minimum energy required to ignite a common solvent, providing a clear, data-driven basis for implementing safety controls.

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory diagnostics suite uses acetone to rinse microscope slide racks at a dedicated solvent dispensing station. In dry winter conditions, staff walking on synthetic flooring can accumulate electrostatic charge. To assess the fire safety need for anti-static controls, model the person–nozzle system at the instant just prior to contact as a single capacitance between the person and the grounded metal dispensing nozzle. Assume the following scientifically plausible parameters based on measurement and environmental conditions: the effective capacitance is $C = 200\\,\\mathrm{pF}$, the potential difference achievable under low humidity is $V = 12\\,\\mathrm{kV}$, and the minimum ignition energy for acetone vapor at near-stoichiometric concentration is $E_{\\mathrm{MIE}} = 1.15\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$.\n\nStarting from core definitions in electromagnetism, derive an expression for the energy stored in a capacitance as a function of $C$ and $V$ and then use it to compute the static discharge energy released if the person contacts the nozzle and the capacitance fully discharges. Treat the discharge as a worst-case energy available to the vapor, neglecting losses. Express the discharge energy in millijoules. Then, compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ of the discharge energy to the minimum ignition energy $E_{\\mathrm{MIE}}$ for acetone vapor.

            "solution": "This problem requires an analysis of the electrostatic energy stored in a system modeling a person and a grounded nozzle to assess the risk of igniting flammable acetone vapor. The analysis proceeds in three stages: first, the derivation of the formula for energy stored in a capacitor; second, the calculation of the potential electrostatic discharge energy; and third, the comparison of this energy to the minimum ignition energy of acetone.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the energy $E$ stored in a capacitance $C$ charged to a potential difference $V$. The definition of capacitance is the ratio of the magnitude of the charge $Q$ on one conductor to the potential difference $V$ between the conductors:\n$$C = \\frac{Q}{V}$$\nThe work $dW$ done in moving an infinitesimal charge $dq$ across a potential difference $v$ is given by:\n$$dW = v \\, dq$$\nAs a capacitor is charged from a state of zero charge to a final charge $Q$, the potential difference across it increases from $0$ to $V$. At any intermediate state where the charge is $q$, the potential difference is $v = q/C$. Substituting this into the expression for the differential work done gives:\n$$dW = \\frac{q}{C} \\, dq$$\nThe total energy $E$ stored in the capacitor is the total work done to charge it. This is found by integrating $dW$ from the initial charge of $q=0$ to the final charge $q=Q$:\n$$E = W = \\int_0^Q \\frac{q}{C} \\, dq$$\nSince the capacitance $C$ is a constant for a given physical configuration, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_0^Q q \\, dq$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{C} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}q^2 \\right]_0^Q = \\frac{1}{C} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}Q^2 - 0 \\right) = \\frac{Q^2}{2C}$$\nTo express this energy in terms of the directly provided parameters $C$ and $V$, we substitute $Q = CV$ into the derived energy expression:\n$$E = \\frac{(CV)^2}{2C} = \\frac{C^2 V^2}{2C} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship for the energy stored in a capacitor.\n\nNext, we calculate the electrostatic discharge energy $E_{\\text{discharge}}$ for the given system. The problem postulates a worst-case scenario where the entire stored energy is released in the discharge. The provided parameters are:\n- Capacitance, $C = 200\\,\\mathrm{pF} = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- Potential difference, $V = 12\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 12 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nUsing the derived formula for stored energy:\n$$E_{\\text{discharge}} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) (12 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{V})^2$$\nLet's carry out the calculation:\n$$E_{\\text{discharge}} = \\frac{1}{2} (2.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F}) (144 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{V}^2)$$\n$$E_{\\text{discharge}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F}) (1.44 \\times 10^8\\,\\mathrm{V}^2)$$\n$$E_{\\text{discharge}} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem asks for this energy to be expressed in millijoules ($1\\,\\mathrm{mJ} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{J}$):\n$$E_{\\text{discharge}} = 1.44 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{J} \\times \\left(\\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}{1\\,\\mathrm{J}}\\right) = 14.4\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ of the discharge energy $E_{\\text{discharge}}$ to the minimum ignition energy $E_{\\mathrm{MIE}}$ for acetone vapor. The given value is $E_{\\mathrm{MIE}} = 1.15\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$.\n$$R = \\frac{E_{\\text{discharge}}}{E_{\\mathrm{MIE}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated and given values:\n$$R = \\frac{14.4\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}{1.15\\,\\mathrm{mJ}}$$\n$$R \\approx 12.521739...$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$R \\approx 12.5$$\nAccording to the specified criterion, anti-static controls are required if $R \\geq 1$. Since our calculated value $R \\approx 12.5$ is substantially greater than $1$, the risk of ignition is significant, and controls are necessary. The final answer is the numerical value of this ratio.",

Apply a gentle water stream; hydrolysis of $\\mathrm{MgH_2}$ with water is endothermic and will cool the material while diluting any hydrogen formed, preventing ignition.\n\nB.

Apply aqueous film-forming foam; the foam will isolate the hydride from air and the water content will moderate the temperature rise safely.\n\nE.

            "solution": "This problem requires a multi-step analysis to determine the correct and safe response to a combustible metal spill. The core task is to evaluate the consequences of using water and compare it to other extinguishing methods.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the consequences of applying water.**\n\nThe proposed action is to use water. The reaction is given as: $\\mathrm{MgH_2} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2O} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Mg(OH)_2} + 2\\,\\mathrm{H_2}$.\n\n*   **Energy Release:** The enthalpy change is $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{hyd}} \\approx -200\\,\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The negative sign indicates a strongly **exothermic** reaction that releases heat, directly contradicting Option A's claim that it is endothermic and will cool the material.\n*   **Flammable Gas Generation:** The reaction produces 2 moles of flammable hydrogen gas ($\\mathrm{H_2}$) for every 1 mole of magnesium hydride ($\\mathrm{MgH_2}$). First, we find the moles of the spilled $\\mathrm{MgH_2}$:\n    $$n_{\\mathrm{MgH_2}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{g}}{26.32\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} \\approx 0.760\\,\\mathrm{mol}$$\n    This will produce:\n    $$n_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 2 \\times 0.760\\,\\mathrm{mol} = 1.52\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{H_2}$$\n*   **Explosion Hazard:** We can estimate the volume of this hydrogen gas at STP:\n    $$V_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1.52\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\times 22.4\\,\\mathrm{L/mol} \\approx 34.1\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n    When mixed into the fume hood's volume of $0.50\\,\\mathrm{m^3} = 500\\,\\mathrm{L}$, the concentration becomes:\n    $$\\%\\,V_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = \\frac{34.1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{500\\,\\mathrm{L}} \\times 100\\% = 6.82\\%$$\n    This concentration is well above hydrogen's Lower Flammability Limit (LFL) of $4\\%$. Since the material is already \"smoldering,\" an ignition source is present. Applying water would create an explosive atmosphere and likely trigger a violent explosion.\n\n**Conclusion:** Applying water (Option A) or any water-based agent like foam (Option D) is extremely dangerous and must be avoided.\n\n**Step 2: Evaluate alternative extinguishing agents.**\n\n*   **Option C (Carbon Dioxide):** $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is not inert with respect to hot, reactive metals like magnesium. The reaction $2\\,\\mathrm{Mg} + \\mathrm{CO_2} \\rightarrow 2\\,\\mathrm{MgO} + \\mathrm{C}$ is also exothermic and would fuel the fire. Therefore, $\\mathrm{CO_2}$ is contraindicated for Class D fires.\n*   **Option E (Nitrogen Blanket):** While nitrogen is inert and would prevent combustion, it does not stop the violent exothermic reaction between $\\mathrm{MgH_2}$ and water. The suggestion to use water \"without risk\" after inerting is false, as the primary hydrolysis reaction itself is hazardous.\n*   **Option B (Class D Dry Powder):** This is the standard, correct approach for combustible metal fires. The agent (e.g., NaCl-based powder) works by smothering the fuel, isolating it from atmospheric oxygen and moisture. It also acts as a highly effective heat sink. Let's verify the heat absorption claim for 1 kg of NaCl powder, assuming it heats from ambient ($25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) to its melting point ($801^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) and melts:\n    *   Sensible Heat (heating): $Q_{\\text{sensible}} = m \\cdot c_p \\cdot \\Delta T = (1000\\,\\text{g}) \\cdot (0.85\\,\\mathrm{J/(g\\,K)}) \\cdot (801 - 25\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 6.6 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{J}$\n    *   Latent Heat (melting): $Q_{\\text{latent}} = m \\cdot L_f = (1\\,\\text{kg}) \\cdot (460\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}) = 4.6 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n    *   Total Heat Absorbed: $Q_{\\text{total}} = Q_{\\text{sensible}} + Q_{\\text{latent}} \\approx 1.12 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n    The claim that the powder can absorb \"on the order of $10^6\\,\\mathrm{J}$ per kilogram\" is accurate. This action safely addresses the hazard without introducing dangerous chemical reactions.\n\nTherefore, option B is the only correct and safe course of action.",

The initial state is ambient air, which is a mixture of oxygen ($\\text{O}_2$) and other gases, primarily nitrogen ($\\text{N}_2$). We are given the initial mole fraction of oxygen as $y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}} = 0.21$. Assuming negligible carbon dioxide and other trace gases, the mole fraction of nitrogen and other inert components is $y_{N_2,\\mathrm{air}} = 1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}} = 1 - 0.21 = 0.79$.

Let the mole fractions in this final mixture be $y'_{O_2}$, $y'_{N_2}$, and $y'_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$. Since the $\\text{CO}_2$ is added to the existing air and does not react with it, the ratio of moles of nitrogen to moles of oxygen remains unchanged. Therefore, their mole fractions in the final mixture must also satisfy this ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{y'_{N_2}}{y'_{O_2}} = \\frac{1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the final nitrogen mole fraction in terms of the final oxygen mole fraction:\n$$\ny'_{N_2} = y'_{O_2} \\left( \\frac{1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}} \\right)\n$$\n\nExtinguishment occurs when the oxygen mole fraction in the final mixture is reduced to the critical level, $y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}} = 0.12$. So, at the design condition, we set $y'_{O_2} = y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nIn the final mixture, the sum of all mole fractions must be equal to $1$:\n$$\ny'_{O_2} + y'_{N_2} + y'_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 1\n$$\nThe design mole fraction of $\\text{CO}_2$, denoted $y_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}}$, corresponds to the mole fraction $y'_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ when $y'_{O_2} = y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}}$. We can solve for $y_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}}$:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} = 1 - y'_{O_2} - y'_{N_2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $y'_{O_2}$ and $y'_{N_2}$ at the critical condition:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} = 1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}} - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}} \\left( \\frac{1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out $y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} = 1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the term in the parenthesis:\n$$\n1 + \\frac{1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}} = \\frac{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}} + 1 - y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}} = \\frac{1}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $y_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} = 1 - \\frac{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}}}{y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $y_{O_2,\\mathrm{air}} = 0.21$ and $y_{O_2,\\mathrm{crit}} = 0.12$.\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} = 1 - \\frac{0.12}{0.21} = 1 - \\frac{12}{21} = 1 - \\frac{4}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nSo, the design mole fraction of $\\text{CO}_2$ is $\\frac{3}{7}$, which is approximately $0.4286$.\n\nNext, we calculate the dimensionless margin ratio to the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL), defined as:\n$$\nR_L \\equiv \\frac{y_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}}}{y_{\\mathrm{LOAEL}}}\n$$\nWe are given $y_{\\mathrm{LOAEL}} = 0.05$.

A mole fraction of $y_{\\mathrm{CO_2,des}} \\approx 0.43$ ($43\\%$) is rapidly fatal. Therefore, stringent procedural safeguards are an absolute necessity.\n\nBased on this analysis, the following procedural safeguards should be implemented before any discharge when occupants may be present:\n1.  **Pre-Discharge Alarm and Time Delay:** An automatic, high-intensity audible and visual alarm must activate a sufficient time before the $\\text{CO}_2$ discharge. This time delay must be adequate for all occupants to evacuate the protected space, as specified by relevant safety standards (e.g., NFPA 12).\n2.  **Emergency Abort Stations:** Clearly marked manual abort stations must be located near each exit, allowing personnel to halt the discharge sequence in case of a false alarm or if evacuation is impeded.\n3.  **Comprehensive Training and Drills:** All personnel authorized to enter the area must receive mandatory training on the hazards of the $\\text{CO}_2$ system, the meaning of the alarms, and the specific evacuation procedures. Regular emergency drills are essential to ensure procedural fluency.\n4.  **Warning Signage:** Prominent, unambiguous signs must be placed at all entrances to the protected area, warning of the presence of a life-threatening $\\text{CO}_2$ suppression system.\n5.  **System Lockout/Tagout Procedures:** A formal lockout/tagout procedure must be in place to mechanically and electrically disable the automatic activation of the system during maintenance or other non-emergency activities within the space, preventing accidental discharge.\n6.  **Ensuring Occupant Evacuation:** The system should never be discharged with personnel known to be inside. Procedures must be in place to account for all personnel before a manual activation, and automatic systems rely on a time delay sufficient for self-evacuation.\nThese measures are critical to mitigate the significant life safety risk posed by total-flooding $\\text{CO}_2$ systems in normally occupied areas.",
