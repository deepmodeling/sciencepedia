In a cross-sectional assessment, an independent sample of post-mastectomy patients (group M) has a mean BIS score of $26$ with a standard deviation (SD) of $8$, based on $n_{M} = 60$ participants. An age-matched healthy control group (group C) has a mean BIS score of $18$ with an SD of $6$, based on $n_{C} = 60$ participants.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the standardized mean difference, known as Cohen's $d$, to quantify the effect size of the difference in Body Image Scale (BIS) scores between a group of post-mastectomy patients (group M) and a healthy control group (group C). The problem is statistically well-defined and contains all necessary information for a solution.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nGivens are:\nFor group M: mean $\\bar{x}_M = 26$, standard deviation $s_M = 8$, sample size $n_M = 60$.\nFor group C: mean $\\bar{x}_C = 18$, standard deviation $s_C = 6$, sample size $n_C = 60$.\nAssumptions: The samples are independent, approximately normally distributed, and have equal population variances.\nCriterion: A standardized mean difference of at least $0.5$ is clinically meaningful.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard statistical practice, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe standardized mean difference, Cohen's $d$, is defined as the difference between the two group means divided by a pooled estimate of the within-group standard deviation, denoted as $s_p$.\nThe contrast is for group M relative to group C, so the difference in means is $\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_C$.\nThe formula for Cohen's $d$ is:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_C}{s_p}$$\n\nThe problem states that the pooled standard deviation $s_p$ must be derived by weighting by degrees of freedom. This is the standard method for estimating the common standard deviation when population variances are assumed to be equal. The pooled variance, $s_p^2$, is the weighted average of the sample variances, $s_M^2$ and $s_C^2$, where the weights are the respective degrees of freedom, $df_M = n_M - 1$ and $df_C = n_C - 1$.\n\nThe formula for the pooled variance is:\n$$s_p^2 = \\frac{(n_M - 1)s_M^2 + (n_C - 1)s_C^2}{(n_M - 1) + (n_C - 1)} = \\frac{(n_M - 1)s_M^2 + (n_C - 1)s_C^2}{n_M + n_C - 2}$$\n\nThe pooled standard deviation, $s_p$, is the square root of the pooled variance:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_M - 1)s_M^2 + (n_C - 1)s_C^2}{n_M + n_C - 2}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this formula.\nThe sample sizes are $n_M = 60$ and $n_C = 60$.\nThe sample standard deviations are $s_M = 8$ and $s_C = 6$.\nThe sample variances are therefore $s_M^2 = 8^2 = 64$ and $s_C^2 = 6^2 = 36$.\nThe degrees of freedom for each group are $n_M - 1 = 59$ and $n_C - 1 = 59$.\nThe total degrees of freedom are $n_M + n_C - 2 = 60 + 60 - 2 = 118$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the pooled variance:\n$$s_p^2 = \\frac{(59)(64) + (59)(36)}{118}$$\nWe can factor out $59$ from the numerator:\n$$s_p^2 = \\frac{59(64 + 36)}{118} = \\frac{59(100)}{118}$$\nSince $118 = 2 \\times 59$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$s_p^2 = \\frac{59 \\times 100}{2 \\times 59} = \\frac{100}{2} = 50$$\nThe pooled standard deviation is the square root of this value:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{50} = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} = 5\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nWith the pooled standard deviation calculated, we can now compute Cohen's $d$.\nThe group means are $\\bar{x}_M = 26$ and $\\bar{x}_C = 18$.\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_M - \\bar{x}_C}{s_p} = \\frac{26 - 18}{5\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8}{5\\sqrt{2}}$$\nTo rationalize the denominator and simplify:\n$$d = \\frac{8 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{5\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{2}}{5 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{5}$$\n\nThe problem requires a numerical answer rounded to three significant figures. Using the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$:\n$$d = \\frac{4 \\times 1.41421356}{5} = \\frac{5.65685424}{5} \\approx 1.13137$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $d = 1.13$.\n\nFinally, we must assess whether this effect size is clinically meaningful based on the prespecified criterion. The criterion states that a standardized mean difference of at least $0.5$ is considered clinically meaningful.\nOur calculated value is $d \\approx 1.13$.\nSince $1.13 \\geq 0.5$, the observed difference in body image disturbance between post-mastectomy patients and the healthy control group is considered clinically meaningful.

He now has visible hypertrophic scars across his upper arms and chest. He reports marked body image disturbance characterized by persistent negative self-appraisals (for example, “I look frightening”), heightened vigilance to others’ gaze, and avoidance of public situations where scars are visible. He avoids swimming despite previously enjoying it, citing anticipated judgment and staring at public pools. He endorses elevated distress with the following tasks, rated using Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS; $0$ to $100$):\n\n- Walking in a park wearing a long-sleeve shirt: $20$.\n- Rolling sleeves above elbows in a grocery store: $40$.\n- Short-sleeve shirt at a crowded cafe: $55$.\n- Standing in a community center pool lobby in short sleeves: $60$.\n- Standing on the pool deck at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $65$.\n- Entering the pool at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $75$.\n- Swimming laps at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $80$.\n- Standing on the pool deck at busy hours in short sleeves: $85$.\n- Swimming in a busy public pool without any cover: $95$.\n\nHe often considers wearing a rash guard to “cover up,” and he prefers to leave situations as soon as distress spikes. He seeks Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to return to swimming and reduce distress in public spaces.\n\nFrom the standpoint of established exposure-based treatment principles for body image disturbance and social-evaluative fears, choose the graded exposure plan that best adheres to the following goals without undermining learning: begin at a moderate SUDS level (approximately $40$–$60$), progress in small increments (approximately $5$–$15$ SUDS), minimize or systematically fade safety behaviors (for example, concealment), and repeat each step until within-session distress meaningfully declines (for example, at least a $50\\%$ reduction) before advancing.\n\nWhich option provides the most appropriate graded exposure sequence?\n\nA. Begin at short-sleeve exposure in a crowded cafe ($55$), then community center pool lobby ($60$), pool deck off-peak ($65$), enter pool off-peak ($75$), swim laps off-peak ($80$), stand on deck at busy hours ($85$), and finally swim in a busy pool without cover ($95$). Prohibit concealment garments at all steps, schedule $2$–$3$ in vivo exposures per week, and require within-session SUDS reduction by at least $50\\%$ (for example, $60$ to $30$) on two consecutive sessions before advancing.\n\nB. Start with immediate “flooding” at the busiest public pool without any cover ($95$) to force rapid learning. Instruct leaving as soon as SUDS exceeds $90$ to prevent overwhelming distress, repeat weekly until the task feels “manageable,” then backfill easier steps if needed.\n\nC. Spend several weeks at very low-intensity tasks (long sleeves in park, $20$) paired with continuous concealment (rash guard) to build “confidence,” then jump to standing on a busy deck ($85$). Maintain safety behaviors across all steps to reduce distress and only advance when SUDS falls to $0$.\n\nD. Begin with short-sleeves in grocery store ($40$), then jump directly to swimming laps off-peak ($80$), employing paced breathing to “keep SUDS down.” If distress increases, take a break outside the pool and resume later.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem statement that must be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n- **Patient:** A $28$-year-old man.\n- **Condition:** Deep partial- and full-thickness burns over $30\\%$ of total body surface area (TBSA), resulting in visible hypertrophic scars on upper arms and chest.\n- **Presenting Complaint:** Marked body image disturbance with negative self-appraisals, heightened vigilance, avoidance of public situations, and elevated distress (quantified by SUDS).\n- **Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) Hierarchy:**\n    - Walking in a park wearing a long-sleeve shirt: $20$.\n    - Rolling sleeves above elbows in a grocery store: $40$.\n    - Short-sleeve shirt at a crowded cafe: $55$.\n    - Standing in a community center pool lobby in short sleeves: $60$.\n    - Standing on the pool deck at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $65$.\n    - Entering the pool at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $75$.\n    - Swimming laps at off-peak hours in short sleeves: $80$.\n    - Standing on the pool deck at busy hours in short sleeves: $85$.\n    - Swimming in a busy public pool without any cover: $95$.\n- **Safety/Avoidance Behaviors:** Considers using concealment (rash guard) and leaves situations when distress spikes.\n- **Treatment Goal:** Apply Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) to return to swimming and reduce public distress.\n- **Required Principles for the Exposure Plan:**\n    1.  **Starting Point:** Begin at a moderate SUDS level, approximately $40$–$60$.\n    2.  **Progression:** Progress in small increments, approximately $5$–$15$ SUDS.\n    3.  **Safety Behaviors:** Minimize or systematically fade safety behaviors (e.g., concealment).\n    4.  **Advancement Criterion:** Repeat each step until within-session distress declines meaningfully (e.g., by at least $50\\%$) before advancing.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of clinical and medical psychology. The presentation of body image disturbance following severe burns is a well-documented clinical phenomenon. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, specifically using graded exposure, is the evidence-based, first-line treatment for anxiety-related disorders, including those involving social-evaluative fears and avoidance. The principles listed (graded hierarchy, habituation, fading safety behaviors) are core tenets of exposure therapy based on learning theory. The SUDS scale is a standard tool in this context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear, rank-ordered hierarchy of feared situations with quantitative distress ratings (SUDS). It specifies a clear set of established therapeutic principles that must be used to construct the treatment plan. This allows for a determinate, unique evaluation of the provided options.\n- **Objective:** The problem statement is objective and uses precise clinical language. It reports the patient's subjective experiences (SUDS ratings, cognitions) as data, which is appropriate for this domain, but the overall framing and the question itself are objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive a solution based on established principles of exposure therapy.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify the graded exposure plan that best adheres to the four specified principles of effective exposure-based treatment. The core mechanism of exposure therapy is to facilitate new learning (inhibitory learning) by systematically confronting feared stimuli without engaging in safety behaviors, allowing the patient to learn that the feared consequences do not occur and that the anxiety response naturally decreases over time (habituation).\n\nLet's evaluate each option against the four principles:\n1.  **Start at moderate SUDS ($40$–$60$).**\n2.  **Progress in small SUDS increments ($5$–$15$).**\n3.  **Minimize/fade safety behaviors.**\n4.  **Repeat until distress reduces (e.g., $50\\%$ drop) before advancing.**\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n- **Sequence:** Cafe ($55$) $\\to$ Pool lobby ($60$) $\\to$ Pool deck off-peak ($65$) $\\to$ Enter pool off-peak ($75$) $\\to$ Swim laps off-peak ($80$) $\\to$ Deck busy ($85$) $\\to$ Swim busy ($95$).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** The plan begins at a SUDS level of $55$, which is squarely within the target moderate range of $40$–$60$. This is appropriate.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The plan follows the patient's SUDS hierarchy in perfect ascending order. The SUDS increments between steps are $5$, $5$, $10$, $5$, $5$, and $10$. All these increments fall within the specified \"small increments\" range of $5$–$15$ SUDS points. This is a correctly graded progression.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The plan explicitly states to \"Prohibit concealment garments at all steps.\" This directly targets and eliminates a primary safety behavior, which is crucial for therapeutic success. The implied structure of staying in the situation to achieve habituation also counters the patient's tendency to escape.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The plan specifies a clear, evidence-based criterion for advancement: \"within-session SUDS reduction by at least $50\\%$ ... on two consecutive sessions before advancing.\" This ensures mastery and robust new learning at each step before increasing the difficulty.\n\n**Verdict for A:** This option systematically and correctly applies all four of the specified principles for effective graded exposure. It represents a well-designed, evidence-based treatment plan. **Correct.**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n- **Sequence:** Starts with \"flooding\" at the highest step (SUDS $95$).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** Starting at $95$ SUDS violates the principle of a moderate start ($40$–$60$). While flooding is a therapeutic technique, it is not *graded* exposure and carries a high risk of iatrogenic harm, non-compliance, or treatment dropout, especially with a patient who is just beginning therapy.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** This is not a graded progression; it is the antithesis of one.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The instruction to \"Instruct leaving as soon as SUDS exceeds $90$\" is counter-therapeutic. This reinforces escape as a valid coping mechanism, thereby strengthening the anxiety cycle. The core of exposure is to remain in the situation until anxiety subsides naturally.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The criterion \"until the task feels 'manageable'\" is vague and subjective, unlike the quantitative $50\\%$ reduction rule.\n\n**Verdict for B:** This option violates every key principle of graded exposure therapy. It is an inappropriate and potentially harmful plan. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n- **Sequence:** Starts at SUDS $20$ (park), then jumps to SUDS $85$ (busy deck).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** A SUDS level of $20$ is too low to be therapeutically effective. Such a low-anxiety exposure does not sufficiently activate the fear structure to allow for new learning.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The jump from $20$ to $85$ is a massive, ungraded leap that violates the small increments rule. This sets the patient up for failure.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** The plan explicitly mandates \"continuous concealment (rash guard)\" and to \"Maintain safety behaviors across all steps.\" This is fundamentally wrong. Safety behaviors prevent the disconfirmation of feared beliefs and must be eliminated, not encouraged.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** Requiring SUDS to fall to $0$ is an unrealistic and often unattainable standard that can stall therapy indefinitely. A significant reduction is the goal, not total elimination of a natural emotion.\n\n**Verdict for C:** This is a poorly designed plan that promotes safety behaviors and uses an improper progression, rendering it ineffective. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n- **Sequence:** Starts at SUDS $40$ (grocery store), then jumps to SUDS $80$ (swim laps off-peak).\n- **Principle 1 (Starting Point):** The starting point of SUDS $40$ is appropriate and within the $40$–$60$ range.\n- **Principle 2 (Progression):** The plan involves a jump from $40$ to $80$ SUDS, which is a $40$-point leap. This violates the small increments ($5$–$15$ SUDS) principle and is likely to be overwhelming for the patient.\n- **Principle 3 (Safety Behaviors):** This plan actively encourages multiple safety behaviors: using paced breathing to suppress distress, taking a break (escape) when distress increases, and wearing a rash guard (concealment). All of these actions prevent the patient from learning to tolerate anxiety and disconfirm their fears.\n- **Principle 4 (Advancement Criterion):** The instruction to \"take a break outside the pool\" if distress increases is the opposite of the habituation principle. It teaches the patient to escape rather than to endure the anxiety until it naturally subsides.\n\n**Verdict for D:** Although the starting point is correct, the plan's progression is flawed, and it actively promotes multiple types of safety and avoidance behaviors that are counter-therapeutic. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\nOption A is the only choice that constructs a therapeutic plan consistent with all the established, evidence-based principles of graded exposure therapy as outlined in the problem statement. It starts appropriately, progresses systematically, eliminates safety behaviors, and uses a proper criterion for advancement.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of Classical Test Theory (CTT), is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Reliable Change Index (RCI) to assess the statistical significance of a change in a patient's score on a psychological instrument.\n\nFirst, we state the fundamental axioms of Classical Test Theory (CTT). An observed score $X$ is conceived as the sum of a true score $T$ and a random measurement error $E$:\n$$X = T + E$$\nThe error component $E$ is assumed to have an expected value of zero, $E[E]=0$, and to be uncorrelated with the true score $T$.\n\nThe objective is to determine if the observed change in scores from baseline ($X_1$) to follow-up ($X_2$) is a true change or merely a result of the inherent imprecision (unreliability) of the measurement instrument. The observed scores are given as $X_1 = 85$ and $X_2 = 70$.\n\nThe RCI is defined as the observed change score divided by the standard error of the difference between the two scores, $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nTo derive the formula for $S_{diff}$ from first principles, we consider the null hypothesis ($H_0$) that no true change has occurred, i.e., the true score is the same at both time points: $T_1 = T_2$. Under this hypothesis, the observed difference is due solely to measurement error:\n$$X_2 - X_1 = (T_2 + E_2) - (T_1 + E_1)$$\nGiven $T_1 = T_2$, this simplifies to:\n$$X_2 - X_1 = E_2 - E_1$$\nThe variance of this difference, which defines $S_{diff}^2$, is given by:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = \\text{Var}(E_2 - E_1)$$\nAssuming the measurement errors at the two time points are independent, as stated in the problem, the variance of the difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = \\text{Var}(E_2) + \\text{Var}(E_1)$$\nThe variance of the measurement error, $\\text{Var}(E)$, is the square of the standard error of measurement, $S_E$. Thus, we can write:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = S_{E_2}^2 + S_{E_1}^2$$\nA standard assumption in RCI calculation is that the standard error of measurement is constant across administrations, i.e., $S_{E_1} = S_{E_2} = S_E$. This yields:\n$$S_{diff}^2 = S_E^2 + S_E^2 = 2S_E^2$$\nTaking the square root gives the standard error of the difference:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2S_E^2} = S_E \\sqrt{2}$$\nWithin CTT, the standard error of measurement $S_E$ is related to the standard deviation of the test scores ($SD$) and the test's reliability coefficient ($r$) by the formula:\n$$S_E = SD \\sqrt{1-r}$$\nThe problem provides the test-retest standard deviation $SD=10$ and test-retest reliability $r = 0.85$. Substituting the expression for $S_E$ into the equation for $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = (SD \\sqrt{1-r}) \\sqrt{2} = SD \\sqrt{2(1-r)}$$\nThis is the derived formula for the standard error of the difference used in the RCI.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value of $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = 10 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.85)} = 10 \\sqrt{2(0.15)} = 10 \\sqrt{0.30}$$\n$$S_{diff} \\approx 5.477225575$$\nNext, we compute the RCI using the observed scores $X_1 = 85$ and $X_2 = 70$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{70 - 85}{5.477225575} = \\frac{-15}{5.477225575} \\approx -2.7386127875$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$RCI \\approx -2.739$$\n\nThe final step is to classify the change. The RCI follows a standard normal distribution under the null hypothesis of no true change. For a two-tailed significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical values are $Z_{\\alpha/2} = Z_{0.025}$ and $-Z_{\\alpha/2} = -Z_{0.025}$. The value of $Z_{0.025}$ from the standard normal distribution is approximately $1.96$.\nTherefore, a change is considered statistically reliable if $|RCI| > 1.96$.\n\nOur calculated RCI is approximately $-2.739$. We check the condition:\n$$|-2.739| = 2.739 > 1.96$$\nThe condition is met, so the observed change is statistically reliable.\n\nWe must now determine the direction of the change. The problem states that higher DAS$59$ scores indicate greater appearance-related distress. The score changed from $85$ to $70$, which is a decrease. A decrease in distress constitutes a clinical improvement. Since the change is both statistically reliable and represents an improvement, we classify it as a \"reliable improvement\".\n\nAccording to the classification scheme provided, the indicator variable $I$ is defined as $I=1$ for reliable improvement, $I=0$ for no reliable change, and $I=-1$ for reliable deterioration.\nOur finding corresponds to $I=1$.\n\nThe two required outputs are the numerical value of RCI ($ -2.739 $) and the indicator $I$ ($1$).",
