This first exercise provides a fundamental hands-on experience in calculating the expected number of false positives, a critical metric for assessing a screening program's burden on follow-up resources and patient anxiety. By working from basic definitions of prevalence and specificity, you will see how these key parameters directly influence screening outcomes in a population .",

            "problem": "A primary care clinic implements a brief depression screening using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). For a given visit cycle, a total of $N=1{,}000$ patients are screened. Let $D$ denote the event that a patient truly has a current depressive disorder and $\\bar{D}$ denote the event that a patient does not have the disorder. The screening test returns either a positive result, denoted $T^{+}$, or a negative result, denoted $T^{-}$. The clinic’s population has a known disorder prevalence of $p=0.05$, and the test’s specificity is $s=0.92$. Prevalence is defined as the long-run proportion of individuals with the disorder, so $p=P(D)$, and specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test among individuals without the disorder, so $s=P(T^{-}\\mid \\bar{D})$. A false positive occurs when the test is positive for a patient who does not have the disorder, that is, the event $T^{+}\\cap \\bar{D}$.\n\nStarting from these definitions and using only basic probability rules (for example, complements and the law of total probability), derive an expression for the expected number of false positives among $N$ screened patients and then compute its numerical value for $N=1{,}000$, $p=0.05$, and $s=0.92$. Express your final answer as a count per $1{,}000$ individuals. No rounding instruction is necessary if an exact integer is obtained.",
            "solution": "The objective is to find the expected number of false positives among a sample of $N$ patients. A false positive is defined as the joint event where a patient does not have the disorder ($\\bar{D}$) and the screening test returns a positive result ($T^{+}$). This corresponds to the event $T^{+} \\cap \\bar{D}$.\n\nLet $P_{FP}$ be the probability that a single, randomly selected patient from the screened population is a false positive. By definition, this is the probability of the joint event $T^{+} \\cap \\bar{D}$.\n$$P_{FP} = P(T^{+} \\cap \\bar{D})$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, which states $P(A \\cap B) = P(A \\mid B)P(B)$, we can express $P_{FP}$ as:\n$$P_{FP} = P(T^{+} \\mid \\bar{D}) P(\\bar{D})$$\nThe problem provides the necessary information to determine the two terms on the right-hand side, $P(\\bar{D})$ and $P(T^{+} \\mid \\bar{D})$.\n\nThe prevalence of the disorder is given as $p = P(D) = 0.05$. The event of not having the disorder, $\\bar{D}$, is the complement of the event $D$. Therefore, its probability is:\n$$P(\\bar{D}) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$$\n\nThe specificity of the test is given as $s = P(T^{-} \\mid \\bar{D}) = 0.92$. Specificity is the probability of a negative test result ($T^{-}$) given that the patient does not have the disorder ($\\bar{D}$). For a patient who does not have the disorder, the test can only yield a positive result ($T^{+}$) or a negative result ($T^{-}$). Thus, the sum of the conditional probabilities of these two complementary outcomes must be $1$:\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid \\bar{D}) + P(T^{-} \\mid \\bar{D}) = 1$$\nFrom this, we can find the probability of a positive test given no disorder, which is also known as the false positive rate:\n$$P(T^{+} \\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - s$$\n\nWe can now substitute these derived expressions for $P(\\bar{D})$ and $P(T^{+} \\mid \\bar{D})$ back into the equation for $P_{FP}$:\n$$P_{FP} = (1 - s)(1 - p)$$\n\nThe total number of false positives in a group of $N$ patients can be described by a random variable. Assuming each patient screening is an independent trial, the total number of false positives follows a binomial distribution with $N$ trials and a probability of success (a single false positive) equal to $P_{FP}$. The expected value, $E[FP]$, of a binomially distributed random variable is the product of the number of trials and the probability of success in each trial.\nTherefore, the expected number of false positives is:\n$$E[FP] = N \\times P_{FP} = N(1-s)(1-p)$$\nThis is the general expression for the expected number of false positives.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given data: $N = 1{,}000$, $p = 0.05$, and $s = 0.92$.\n$$E[FP] = 1{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.92) \\times (1 - 0.05)$$\n$$E[FP] = 1{,}000 \\times 0.08 \\times 0.95$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$E[FP] = 80 \\times 0.95$$\n$$E[FP] = 76$$\nThe expected number of false positives among the $1{,}000$ screened patients is exactly $76$.

The tool is later implemented in a general primary care practice where the prevalence of current major depressive episode is $0.10$.

            "solution": "The Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a subject with a positive test result is truly positive for the disease.

The problem illustrates this directly, as the test moves from a specialty clinic with \"moderate-to-severe presentations\" to a primary care practice with \"milder and atypical cases,\" causing the sensitivity to decrease from $0.90$ to $0.80$.",
