This exercise demonstrates how medical psychology quantifies pain as an experience shaped by both the body and the mind. By modeling the interplay between nociceptive input, the cognitive amplification from catastrophizing, and pharmacological intervention, we can translate psychological theory into a practical clinical calculation for pain management .",

            "problem": "A hospitalized adult on postoperative day one reports pain while recovering from orthopedic surgery. In medical psychology, perceived pain intensity measured on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is understood to arise from nociceptive input modulated by cognitive-affective processes such as catastrophizing. Suppose the nociceptive source intensity (the sensory component prior to cognitive amplification) is quantified as $I_{N} = 6$ on the VAS. The patient’s Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score prior to hospitalization was $C_{0} = 12$. Due to hospitalization stressors (novel environment, disrupted sleep, loss of control), the PCS score increases by $\\Delta C = 6$ points during the inpatient period, so the current catastrophizing score is $C = C_{0} + \\Delta C$. Assume the cognitive-affective amplification factor is linear in the catastrophizing score and given by $A(C) = 1 + k C$, where $k = 0.02$. Assume an analgesic with a pharmacodynamic effect described by an $E_{\\text{max}}$ model, where the fraction of nociception blocked at dose $D$ (in milligrams) is $E(D) = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{D}{EC_{50} + D}$, with $E_{\\text{max}} = 0.95$ and half-maximal effective concentration $EC_{50} = 10$ (milligrams). Let perceived pain intensity after dose $D$ be modeled as $I(D) = A(C)\\, I_{N}\\, \\bigl(1 - E(D)\\bigr)$.\n\nIf the clinical goal is to achieve a perceived pain intensity of $I_{\\text{target}} = 3$ on the VAS, compute the dose $D$ (in milligrams) required to meet this target under the assumptions above. Express your final answer in milligrams and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to compute the analgesic dose $D$ required to reduce a patient's perceived pain intensity to a target level of $I_{\\text{target}} = 3$. We will solve the provided quantitative model for the dose $D$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's current Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) score, $C$, which is the sum of the initial score ($C_0 = 12$) and the increase due to hospitalization ($\\Delta C = 6$):\n$$ C = C_0 + \\Delta C = 12 + 6 = 18 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the cognitive-affective amplification factor, $A(C)$, using the given linear model with $k = 0.02$:\n$$ A(C) = 1 + k C = 1 + (0.02)(18) = 1 + 0.36 = 1.36 $$\n\nThe model for perceived pain intensity after dose $D$ is $I(D) = A(C)\\, I_{N}\\, \\bigl(1 - E(D)\\bigr)$. We set this equal to the target pain intensity, $I_{\\text{target}} = 3$, using the known values $A(C) = 1.36$ and nociceptive source intensity $I_{N} = 6$.\n$$ 3 = (1.36)(6) \\bigl(1 - E(D)\\bigr) $$\n$$ 3 = 8.16 \\bigl(1 - E(D)\\bigr) $$\n\nWe now solve for the required fractional effect of the drug, $E(D)$:\n$$ 1 - E(D) = \\frac{3}{8.16} $$\n$$ E(D) = 1 - \\frac{3}{8.16} = \\frac{8.16 - 3}{8.16} = \\frac{5.16}{8.16} $$\n\nThe fractional effect $E(D)$ is described by the $E_{\\text{max}}$ model: $E(D) = E_{\\text{max}} \\frac{D}{EC_{50} + D}$. We equate this with the required effect, using the parameters $E_{\\text{max}} = 0.95$ and $EC_{50} = 10$ mg.\n$$ 0.95 \\cdot \\frac{D}{10 + D} = \\frac{5.16}{8.16} $$\n\nNow, we solve for the dose $D$. First, isolate the term containing $D$:\n$$ \\frac{D}{10 + D} = \\frac{1}{0.95} \\left( \\frac{5.16}{8.16} \\right) = \\frac{5.16}{0.95 \\times 8.16} = \\frac{5.16}{7.752} $$\n\nTo solve for $D$, we can rearrange the equation. Let $\\mathcal{K} = \\frac{5.16}{7.752}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ D = \\mathcal{K} (10 + D) \\implies D(1 - \\mathcal{K}) = 10\\mathcal{K} \\implies D = \\frac{10\\mathcal{K}}{1 - \\mathcal{K}} $$\n\nSubstituting the value for $\\mathcal{K}$:\n$$ D = \\frac{10 \\left( \\frac{5.16}{7.752} \\right)}{1 - \\frac{5.16}{7.752}} = \\frac{10 \\times 5.16}{7.752 - 5.16} = \\frac{51.6}{2.592} $$\n\nPerforming the final division:\n$$ D \\approx 19.90739969... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required dose is $19.9$ mg.",

This practice delves into the powerful placebo and nocebo effects, which are the respective positive and negative health changes arising from a patient's expectations.

            "problem": "A hospitalized postoperative patient reports a baseline pain on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; $0$ to $10$) of $x_0 = 7.5$. The ward provides a standard analgesic, which has a well-established average pharmacological effect of $\\mu_A = 2.3$ NRS points of reduction. In addition to pharmacology, psychological processes modulated by the hospital context can change pain via placebo (positive expectation) and nocebo (negative expectation) mechanisms. Define the placebo effect as an improvement in symptoms attributable to positive expectations induced by care context, and define the nocebo effect as a worsening of symptoms attributable to negative expectations. Assume the following foundational facts and modeling choices, which are widely used in medical psychology and psychophysiology research:\n\n- Expectancy formation from contextual cues is modeled by a logistic psychometric function $\\sigma(z) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-z)}$ mapping cue intensity to the probability of an expectancy-driven response.\n- The expected value operator is linear, and zero-mean random noise around effects implies it does not contribute to the expected outcome.\n- Placebo and nocebo processes are treated as independent additive expectancy components on average, consistent with concurrent positive and negative cues jointly shaping expectations in hospitalization.\n\nLet the intensity of positive clinician communication be $x = 0.8$ (unitless, $0$ to $1$), and the intensity of negative environmental cues (e.g., alarming signage, frequent nighttime disturbances) be $y = 0.3$ (unitless, $0$ to $1$). The probabilities of a placebo response and a nocebo response, respectively, are given by\n$$\np_P = \\sigma(\\alpha_P + \\beta_P x), \\quad p_N = \\sigma(\\alpha_N + \\beta_N y),\n$$\nwith $\\alpha_P = -0.2$, $\\beta_P = 2.0$, $\\alpha_N = -0.6$, and $\\beta_N = 3.0$.\n\nThe average placebo effect size (if a placebo response occurs) is $\\mu_P = 1.1$ NRS points of reduction, and the average nocebo effect size (if a nocebo response occurs) is $\\mu_N = 0.9$ NRS points of increase. Hospital-related state anxiety attenuates placebo and amplifies nocebo effects multiplicatively. Let the patient’s current state anxiety be $A = 0.4$ (unitless, $0$ to $1$). The anxiety modulation parameters are $\\kappa = 0.25$ for placebo attenuation and $\\lambda = 0.3$ for nocebo amplification, so that the anxiety-modulated effect magnitudes are $\\mu_P(1 - \\kappa A)$ and $\\mu_N(1 + \\lambda A)$.\n\nUsing the definitions above and the linearity of expectation, compute the expected post-intervention NRS pain score, denoted $E[S]$, after the combined pharmacological and contextual psychological influences.
