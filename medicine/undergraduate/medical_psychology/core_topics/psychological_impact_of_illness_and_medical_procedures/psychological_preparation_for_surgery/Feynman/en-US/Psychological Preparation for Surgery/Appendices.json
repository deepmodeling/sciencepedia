            "problem": "A preoperative clinic integrates a brief psychological screening instrument, such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), into the psychological preparation for surgery to identify patients with clinically significant preoperative anxiety who may benefit from targeted interventions (e.g., cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce perioperative distress and improve recovery). In a low-risk surgical population, the base rate of clinically significant anxiety (the pretest probability) is $0.05$. The screening instrument has sensitivity $0.90$ and specificity $0.95$.

The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are fundamental to evaluating diagnostic tests. The provided numerical values are plausible.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity) to calculate the desired posterior probability (positive predictive value). The question is clear and has a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet $A$ be the event that a patient has clinically significant preoperative anxiety.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the patient's screening test result is positive.\nLet $A^c$ be the complement of $A$, representing the event that a patient does not have clinically significant anxiety.\n\nThe information provided in the problem statement can be translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\n\n$1$. The base rate, or pretest probability (prevalence), of anxiety is $P(A) = 0.05$.\nFrom this, the probability that a randomly selected patient does not have anxiety is $P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n\n$2$. The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given that the patient has the condition. In our notation, this is the conditional probability:\n$$P(T^+ | A) = 0.90$$\n\n$3$. The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given that the patient does not have the condition. Let $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result. The specificity is:\n$$P(T^- | A^c) = 0.95$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test probability that the patient has anxiety given a positive test result. This corresponds to the conditional probability $P(A | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the specified constraints, we must use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result in this population. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, which allows us to express $P(T^+)$ by conditioning on whether the patient has anxiety ($A$) or not ($A^c$):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | A) P(A) + P(T^+ | A^c) P(A^c)$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need the value of $P(T^+ | A^c)$, which is the probability of a positive test for a patient who does not have anxiety (the false positive rate). We are given the specificity, $P(T^- | A^c)$. Since a test result can only be positive or negative for a person without anxiety, we have:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) + P(T^- | A^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | A^c) = 1 - P(T^- | A^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nNow we can compute $P(T^+)$ by substituting the known values into the law of total probability formula:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.05) + (0.05)(0.95)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.045 + 0.0475$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0925$$\n\nFinally, we substitute all the calculated and given values into Bayes' theorem to find the desired post-test probability, $P(A | T^+)$:\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | A) P(A)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.05)}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) = \\frac{0.045}{0.0925}$$\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.486486486...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant digit is $8$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(A | T^+) \\approx 0.4865$$\n\nThus, the post-test probability that a patient who screens positive actually has clinically significant preoperative anxiety is approximately $0.4865$.",

            "introduction": "After identifying a psychological factor like anxiety, it's vital to track its changes over time and determine if those changes are meaningful. This practice problem introduces the concept of a standardized change score to quantify the magnitude of a shift in a patient's state relative to the typical variability of the measure. By comparing this change to a pre-defined Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID), you will learn how to distinguish statistically significant fluctuations from those that are genuinely impactful for patient care .",

            "problem": "A surgical unit tracks preoperative anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory–State subscale (STAI-S). In a cohort preparing for elective procedures, the mean STAI-S at baseline (pre-admission clinic) is $M_{1}=35$, and on the morning of surgery just prior to anesthetic induction it is $M_{2}=45$. Across repeated assessments in this service, the STAI-S exhibits an approximately stable common standard deviation of $SD=10$. For decision-making about whether observed changes are meaningfully large in practice, the unit adopts a distribution-based minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined as one-half of a standard deviation on the scale. Using only the conceptual definition that a standardized change expresses the mean change in the original units relative to the variability of the measure in standard deviation units, compute the standardized change score for this cohort and determine whether it exceeds the MCID threshold. Report only the value of the standardized change score in your final answer, rounded to three significant figures. The standardized change score is unitless.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established statistical and psychometric principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed in objective language. The problem can be solved as stated.\n\nThe primary task is to compute a standardized change score and subsequently evaluate it against a specified criterion for a minimal clinically important difference (MCID).\n\nFirst, we define the variables provided in the problem statement:\n- The mean anxiety score at baseline is $M_{1} = 35$.\n- The mean anxiety score just prior to surgery is $M_{2} = 45$.\n- The common standard deviation for the anxiety measure is $SD = 10$.\n\nThe problem defines the standardized change score conceptually as \"the mean change in the original units relative to the variability of the measure in standard deviation units.\" We will formalize this definition mathematically.\n\nLet the standardized change score be denoted by the variable $d$.\nThe \"mean change in the original units\" is the difference between the final mean score and the initial mean score, which is $\\Delta M = M_{2} - M_{1}$.\nThe \"variability of the measure in standard deviation units\" is the standard deviation, $SD$.\nThe term \"relative to\" indicates a ratio. Therefore, the standardized change score $d$ is the ratio of the mean change to the standard deviation:\n$$ d = \\frac{M_{2} - M_{1}}{SD} $$\nThis expression is a standard representation of an effect size, specifically a form of Cohen's $d$.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this formula:\n$$ d = \\frac{45 - 35}{10} $$\nPerforming the subtraction in the numerator:\n$$ d = \\frac{10}{10} $$\nThis yields the exact value of the standardized change score:\n$$ d = 1.0 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem involves comparing this value to the MCID threshold. The MCID is defined as \"one-half of a standard deviation on the scale.\" In the standardized scale, one standard deviation corresponds to a value of $1$. Thus, the MCID threshold in standardized units is:\n$$ \\text{MCID}_{\\text{std}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = 0.5 $$\nOur calculated standardized change is $d = 1.0$. Comparing this to the threshold:\n$$ 1.0 > 0.5 $$\nThis demonstrates that the observed change in anxiety from baseline to the morning of surgery exceeds the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference.\n\nThe problem requires a final answer consisting only of the value of the standardized change score, rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1.0$. To represent this with three significant figures, we write it as $1.00$.",

It provides a clear set of definitions and constraints to derive a standard epidemiologic and biostatistical quantity, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), from first principles.
