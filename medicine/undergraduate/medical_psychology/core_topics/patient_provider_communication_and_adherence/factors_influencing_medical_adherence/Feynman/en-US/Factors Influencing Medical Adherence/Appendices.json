            "introduction": "Before we can analyze the factors that influence medication adherence, we must first be able to quantify it. Researchers often use large pharmacy claims datasets, which record when patients refill their prescriptions. This exercise introduces two of the most common metrics derived from such data: the Medication Possession Ratio ($MPR$) and the Proportion of Days Covered ($PDC$). By deriving their formulas and applying them to a hypothetical patient case, you will gain a practical understanding of how adherence is measured and appreciate the important distinctions between these two foundational metrics .",

            "problem": "A pharmacy claims dataset is used in medical psychology to quantify medication adherence. Two well-established adherence metrics are Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) and Proportion of Days Covered (PDC). The accepted conceptual bases are: (i) adherence is the proportion of a specified observation period during which the patient has medication available, and (ii) refill records provide the start date and days' supply for each fill, which implies coverage intervals on the observation timeline. From these bases, derive explicit analytic formulas for $MPR$ and $PDC$ over a finite observation period of length $T$, given a sequence of fills. Let the observation period be the half-open interval $[0,T)$ in days, and let the $i$-th fill occur at time $t_i$ with $s_i$ days' supply, inducing a coverage interval $[t_i, t_i + s_i)$.\n\n- Using only the above bases, derive an expression for $MPR$ as a ratio of the total days' supply dispensed during the observation period to the length of the observation period.\n- Using only the above bases, derive an expression for $PDC$ as a ratio of the total number of days within the observation period that are covered by any supply (counting each day at most once) to the length of the observation period.\n\nThen, for a single patient observed over $T=90$ days with fills at day $t_1=0$ for $s_1=30$ days, day $t_2=35$ for $s_2=30$ days, and day $t_3=70$ for $s_3=30$ days, compute both $MPR$ and $PDC$. Express both metrics as dimensionless proportions (decimal or fraction), without using a percentage sign. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the field of medical psychology and pharmacoepidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. We will first derive the general analytic formulas for the Medication Possession Ratio ($MPR$) and the Proportion of Days Covered ($PDC$) based on the provided definitions, and then apply these formulas to the specific case data.\n\nLet the observation period be the time interval $I_{obs} = [0, T)$. Let there be a sequence of $N$ fills, where the $i$-th fill is characterized by a start date $t_i$ and a days' supply $s_i$. The set of indices corresponding to fills that occur within the observation period is $K = \\{i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N\\} \\mid t_i \\in [0, T)\\}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Medication Possession Ratio ($MPR$) Formula**\n\nThe problem defines $MPR$ as \"a ratio of the total days' supply dispensed during the observation period to the length of the observation period.\"\n\nThe fills dispensed *during* the observation period are those with fill dates $t_i$ such that $0 \\le t_i < T$. The total days' supply for these fills is the sum of their respective supplies, $s_i$, for all $i \\in K$.\n$$ \\text{Total Days' Supply} = \\sum_{i \\in K} s_i $$\nThe length of the observation period is $T$.\nTherefore, the explicit analytic formula for $MPR$ is:\n$$ MPR = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in K} s_i}{T} $$\nThis metric sums all supplies dispensed within the period, regardless of whether the supply is used within the period or extends beyond it, and without accounting for overlapping supplies from early refills. Consequently, $MPR$ values can be greater than $1$.\n\n**Derivation of the Proportion of Days Covered ($PDC$) Formula**\n\nThe problem defines $PDC$ as \"a ratio of the total number of days within the observation period that are covered by any supply (counting each day at most once) to the length of the observation period.\"\n\nFor each fill $i \\in K$, a coverage interval is induced, given by $C_i = [t_i, t_i + s_i)$. The set of all days covered by any of these supplies is the union of these intervals:\n$$ C_{union} = \\bigcup_{i \\in K} C_i $$\nThe problem specifies that we only count days *within* the observation period. This requires intersecting the total coverage set with the observation interval $I_{obs} = [0, T)$:\n$$ C_{covered} = C_{union} \\cap I_{obs} = \\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in K} [t_i, t_i + s_i) \\right) \\cap [0, T) $$\nThe phrase \"counting each day at most once\" is mathematically handled by taking the union, as the union of sets naturally does not double-count elements. The total number of covered days is the Lebesgue measure (i.e., the total length) of the set $C_{covered}$, denoted by $\\mu(C_{covered})$.\nTherefore, the explicit analytic formula for $PDC$ is:\n$$ PDC = \\frac{\\mu(C_{covered})}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\mu\\left( \\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in K} [t_i, t_i + s_i) \\right) \\cap [0, T) \\right) $$\nBy definition, the number of covered days cannot exceed the length of the observation period, so $PDC$ is always capped at $1$.\n\n**Application to the Specific Case**\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Length of observation period: $T = 90$ days, so $I_{obs} = [0, 90)$.\n- Fill 1: $t_1 = 0$, $s_1 = 30$.\n- Fill 2: $t_2 = 35$, $s_2 = 30$.\n- Fill 3: $t_3 = 70$, $s_3 = 30$.\n\nThe fill dates are $t_1=0$, $t_2=35$, and $t_3=70$. All three dates lie within the interval $[0, 90)$, so the set of relevant fill indices is $K = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\n**Calculation of $MPR$**\n\nUsing the derived formula for $MPR$:\n$$ MPR = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} s_i}{T} = \\frac{s_1+s_2+s_3}{90} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ MPR = \\frac{30 + 30 + 30}{90} = \\frac{90}{90} = 1 $$\n\n**Calculation of $PDC$**\n\nUsing the derived formula for $PDC$, we first determine the set of covered days, $C_{covered}$.\nThe coverage intervals for the three fills are:\n- $C_1 = [t_1, t_1 + s_1) = [0, 30)$\n- $C_2 = [t_2, t_2 + s_2) = [35, 65)$\n- $C_3 = [t_3, t_3 + s_3) = [70, 100)$\n\nThe union of these intervals is $C_{union} = [0, 30) \\cup [35, 65) \\cup [70, 100)$.\nNext, we find the intersection of this union with the observation interval $I_{obs} = [0, 90)$:\n$$ C_{covered} = \\left( [0, 30) \\cup [35, 65) \\cup [70, 100) \\right) \\cap [0, 90) $$\nWe can distribute the intersection over the union:\n$$ C_{covered} = ([0, 30) \\cap [0, 90)) \\cup ([35, 65) \\cap [0, 90)) \\cup ([70, 100) \\cap [0, 90)) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ C_{covered} = [0, 30) \\cup [35, 65) \\cup [70, 90) $$\nThe intervals $[0, 30)$, $[35, 65)$, and $[70, 90)$ are disjoint. Therefore, the measure of their union is the sum of their individual measures (lengths):\n$$ \\mu([0, 30)) = 30 - 0 = 30 $$\n$$ \\mu([35, 65)) = 65 - 35 = 30 $$\n$$ \\mu([70, 90)) = 90 - 70 = 20 $$\nThe total number of covered days is $\\mu(C_{covered}) = 30 + 30 + 20 = 80$.\nFinally, we calculate $PDC$:\n$$ PDC = \\frac{\\mu(C_{covered})}{T} = \\frac{80}{90} = \\frac{8}{9} $$\n\nThe calculated values are $MPR = 1$ and $PDC = \\frac{8}{9}$.",

            "problem": "A clinician provides a titration instruction to patients initiating basal insulin: “increase by $2$ units every $3$ days.” In medical psychology, health numeracy is the ability to understand and use numerical information in health contexts, and it is a known determinant of medical adherence. Medical adherence is defined as the extent to which a patient’s behavior corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider. Empirical psychometric modeling often uses sigmoidal (logistic) functions to relate task performance to an ability score. Assume that a patient’s numeracy score is $N \\in [0,100]$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of microeconomics (price elasticity of demand), mathematically well-posed, and presented with objective and precise language.

The definition is given as a differential relationship:\n$$ \\epsilon \\equiv \\frac{dQ/Q}{dP/P} $$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be a constant. We can rearrange this equation to separate the variables $Q$ and $P$:\n$$ \\frac{dQ}{Q} = \\epsilon \\frac{dP}{P} $$\nTo find the effect of a finite change in copay from an initial value $P_1$ to a final value $P_2$, with a corresponding change in adherence from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$, we must integrate this differential equation between these two states.\n$$ \\int_{Q_1}^{Q_2} \\frac{1}{Q} dQ = \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \\epsilon \\frac{1}{P} dP $$\nSince $\\epsilon$ is given as a constant, it can be taken out of the integral on the right-hand side:\n$$ \\int_{Q_1}^{Q_2} \\frac{1}{Q} dQ = \\epsilon \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \\frac{1}{P} dP $$\nThe integral of $\\frac{1}{x}$ with respect to $x$ is $\\ln|x|$.
