This exercise demonstrates how to translate abstract statistical properties like sensitivity and specificity into more intuitive measures—Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)—that directly address a patient's concerns. More importantly, it provides practice in using natural frequencies, a powerful and evidence-based technique for communicating risk clearly and avoiding common misunderstandings .",

            "problem": "A clinician in a primary care setting is preparing to explain the meaning of a screening test result to a patient. The test is used to detect a single condition in a population where the prevalence is known. Suppose the test has sensitivity $Se = 0.90$, specificity $Sp = 0.95$, and the condition’s prevalence is $p = 0.10$ in the target population. Using first principles appropriate to medical psychology and the principles of patient-practitioner communication, do the following:\n\n1. Starting from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence as conditional probabilities, and from the law of total probability, derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) without appealing to shortcut formulas. Then compute the numerical values of $PPV$ and $NPV$ for the given $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$. Round your numerical answers to four significant figures and express them as decimals.\n\n2. Prepare a layperson-friendly explanation using natural frequencies that a practitioner could deliver to a patient, by constructing a concrete scenario with a base of $1000$ people in the target population. Describe, in counts, how many would be true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, and then explain what $PPV$ and $NPV$ mean in terms of “out of” statements. Ensure the explanation is scientifically accurate, free of jargon, and grounded in the counts you compute.\n\nReport $PPV$ and $NPV$ in that order for the numerical part of the answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is based on the fundamental principles of probability theory as applied to medical diagnostics. All necessary data are provided, and the questions are unambiguous.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Computation of Predictive Values\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a person has the condition, and $\\neg D$ be the event that the person does not have the condition. Let $T$ be the event of a positive test result, and $\\neg T$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed as conditional probabilities:\n1.  Prevalence, $p = P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not having the condition is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n2.  Sensitivity, $Se = P(T | D) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the condition (the true positive rate). From this, the false negative rate is $P(\\neg T | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n3.  Specificity, $Sp = P(\\neg T | \\neg D) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the condition (the true negative rate). From this, the false positive rate is $P(T | \\neg D) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nThe goal is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value, $PPV = P(D | T)$, and the Negative Predictive Value, $NPV = P(\\neg D | \\neg T)$.\n\nDerivation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$):\nThe $PPV$ is the probability that a person has the condition given that they tested positive. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$PPV = P(D | T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, is the joint probability of having the condition and testing positive. It can be found from the definition of sensitivity: $P(T | D) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(D)}$, which rearranges to $P(D \\cap T) = P(T | D) P(D) = Se \\cdot p$. This term represents the probability of a true positive in the population.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We use the Law of Total Probability, partitioning the event $T$ by whether the person has the condition or not:\n$$P(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap \\neg D)$$\n$$P(T) = P(T | D) P(D) + P(T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(T) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nThe term $(1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - p)$ represents the probability of a false positive in the population.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the full expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.10)}{(0.90)(0.10) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.10)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + (0.05)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.09}{0.09 + 0.045} = \\frac{0.09}{0.135} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV \\approx 0.6667$.\n\nDerivation of Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$):\nThe $NPV$ is the probability that a person does not have the condition given that they tested negative. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$NPV = P(\\neg D | \\neg T) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg T)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)$, is the joint probability of not having the condition and testing negative. It can be found from the definition of specificity: $P(\\neg T | \\neg D) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T)}{P(\\neg D)}$, which rearranges to $P(\\neg D \\cap \\neg T) = P(\\neg T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D) = Sp \\cdot (1 - p)$. This term represents the probability of a true negative in the population.\n\nThe denominator, $P(\\neg T)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T \\cap D) + P(\\neg T \\cap \\neg D)$$\n$$P(\\neg T) = P(\\neg T | D) P(D) + P(\\neg T | \\neg D) P(\\neg D)$$\nSubstituting the known terms:\n$$P(\\neg T) = ((1 - Se) \\cdot p) + (Sp \\cdot (1 - p))$$\nThe term $(1 - Se) \\cdot p$ represents the probability of a false negative in the population.\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator gives the full expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{(1 - Se) \\cdot p + Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.95)(1 - 0.10)}{(1 - 0.90)(0.10) + (0.95)(1 - 0.10)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.90)}{(0.10)(0.10) + (0.95)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.855}{0.01 + 0.855} = \\frac{0.855}{0.865}$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV \\approx 0.9884$.\n\nPart 2: Explanation Using Natural Frequencies\n\nTo explain these results to a patient, we can translate these probabilities into expected counts for a group of $1000$ people representative of the population.\n\nImagine we test a group of $1000$ people. Based on the fact that the condition is present in $10\\%$ of this population, we would expect:\n-   $1000 \\times 0.10 = 100$ people to have the condition.\n-   The remaining $1000 - 100 = 900$ people to not have the condition.\n\nNow, let's look at how the test performs in each of these two groups.\n\nFor the $100$ people who have the condition:\n-   The test is $90\\%$ sensitive, meaning it will correctly give a positive result for $90\\%$ of this group. So, $100 \\times 0.90 = 90$ people will test positive. These are the **true positives**.\n-   The other $10\\%$ will get an incorrect negative result. So, $100 \\times 0.10 = 10$ people will test negative. These are the **false negatives**.\n\nFor the $900$ people who do not have the condition:\n-   The test is $95\\%$ specific, meaning it will correctly give a negative result for $95\\%$ of this group. So, $900 \\times 0.95 = 855$ people will test negative. These are the **true negatives**.\n-   The other $5\\%$ will get an incorrect positive result. So, $900 \\times 0.05 = 45$ people will test positive. These are the **false positives**.\n\nNow we can explain what your test result means.\n\nExplanation for a Positive Test Result ($PPV$):\nLet's look at everyone who tested positive. This includes the $90$ true positives and the $45$ false positives, for a total of $90 + 45 = 135$ people. You are one of these $135$ people.\nOf these $135$ people who tested positive, only the $90$ true positives actually have the condition.\nTherefore, a positive result means that there is a **$90$ out of $135$** chance that you actually have the condition. This simplifies to a $2$ in $3$ chance, or about $67\\%$.\n\nExplanation for a Negative Test Result ($NPV$):\nLet's look at everyone who tested negative. This includes the $10$ false negatives and the $855$ true negatives, for a total of $10 + 855 = 865$ people. Your result puts you in this group.\nOf these $865$ people who tested negative, $855$ of them truly do not have the condition.\nTherefore, a negative result means that there is an **$855$ out of $865$** chance that you do not have the condition. This gives a very high level of confidence, over $98\\%$, that you are indeed free of the condition.",

            "problem": "A clinician is preparing to discuss with a patient the benefits of a preventive therapy on an adverse outcome. The clinician aims to use quantitative summaries that are commonly employed in transparent patient-practitioner communication: absolute risk reduction (ARR), relative risk reduction (RRR), and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). Let the probability of the adverse outcome without treatment be $p_{0} = 0.20$, and the probability with treatment be $p_{1} = 0.12$, with $0 \\leq p_{1} < p_{0} \\leq 1$.

We proceed from core definitions.\n\n1. Definition of risk and absolute change. The risk in a group is the probability of the outcome in that group. For the untreated group, the risk is $p_{0}$; for the treated group, the risk is $p_{1}$. The absolute change in risk due to treatment is the difference between these probabilities. When treatment reduces risk (that is, $p_{1} < p_{0}$), this difference is the absolute risk reduction (ARR), given by\n$$\n\\text{ARR} = p_{0} - p_{1}.\n$$\n\n2.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following facts, definitions, and assumptions:\n- A colorectal cancer screening test performance can be described in two ways: “$90\\%$ detection” or “$10\\%$ missed.”\n- Fact (i): In Prospect Theory (PT), outcomes are encoded relative to a reference point. For a screening test, the reference is perfect detection at $100\\%$.\n- Fact (ii): Losses loom larger than equivalent gains (loss aversion). The disutility of a loss of magnitude $x$ is scaled by a loss aversion coefficient $\\lambda$ with $\\lambda > 1$.\n- Fact (iii): Message framing shifts attention and salience. Attention weights for the emphasized aspect are larger.\n- The description “$90\\%$ detection” is a gain frame.\n- The description “$10\\%$ missed” is a loss frame.\n- Under the gain frame, the attention weight for the positive attribute (detection) is $\\omega_G = 0.7$ and for the negative attribute (missed) is $\\omega_L = 0.3$.\n- Under the loss frame, the attention weights swap to $\\omega_G = 0.3$ and $\\omega_L = 0.7$.\n- The loss aversion coefficient is $\\lambda = 2$.\n- The detection proportion is $p_G = 0.90$.\n- The miss proportion is $p_L = 0.10$.\n- The practitioner’s goal is to maximize screening uptake.\n- Screening uptake increases monotonically with the patient’s net subjective evaluation of the test.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in well-established principles from decision science and medical psychology, namely Prospect Theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) and the effects of message framing. The concepts of a reference point, loss aversion, and attention shifting are central to these fields. The provided values ($\\lambda=2$) are typical for stylized models in this area. The problem is a valid application of these principles to a clinical communication scenario.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of numerical values and relationships needed to construct a quantitative model of subjective evaluation. The question asks for a prediction that can be uniquely derived from this model. The relationship between subjective evaluation and patient behavior (uptake) is clearly defined as monotonic.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. Key terms like \"gain frame\" and \"loss frame\" are explicitly defined, and the quantitative model parameters are given without ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, internally consistent, and based on established scientific theory. There are no contradictions, missing pieces of information, or violations of scientific principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the net subjective evaluation of the screening test under two different framing conditions and compare them. Let $S$ denote this net subjective evaluation. The evaluation is a function of the positive attribute (detection) and the negative attribute (missed cases), weighted by their respective attention weights.\n\nThe value of an outcome in Prospect Theory depends on its framing as a gain or a loss relative to a reference point. The reference point is $100\\%$ detection (or $0\\%$ missed).\n\n- The **gain component** is the detection proportion, $p_G = 0.90$. The value of this gain can be represented as $v_G = p_G = 0.90$.\n- The **loss component** is the miss proportion, $p_L = 0.10$. According to the principle of loss aversion (Fact ii), the disutility of this loss is scaled by the loss aversion coefficient $\\lambda$. The value of this loss is $v_L = -\\lambda \\times p_L$. Given $\\lambda = 2$ and $p_L = 0.10$, the value of the loss is $v_L = -2 \\times 0.10 = -0.20$.\n\nThe net subjective evaluation $S$ is a weighted sum of the values of the gain and loss components, where the weights are the attention weights $\\omega_G$ and $\\omega_L$ determined by the frame (Fact iii).\nThe general formula for the net subjective evaluation is:\n$$S = \\omega_G \\cdot v_G + \\omega_L \\cdot v_L$$\nSubstituting the values for $v_G$ and $v_L$:\n$$S = \\omega_G \\cdot (0.90) + \\omega_L \\cdot (-0.20)$$\n\nNow, we calculate $S$ for each frame.\n\n**1. Gain Frame (“$90\\%$ detection”):**\nUnder this frame, the positive attribute is emphasized. The given attention weights are $\\omega_G = 0.7$ and $\\omega_L = 0.3$.\nThe subjective evaluation, $S_{\\text{gain}}$, is:\n$$S_{\\text{gain}} = (0.7) \\cdot (0.90) + (0.3) \\cdot (-0.20)$$\n$$S_{\\text{gain}} = 0.63 - 0.06 = 0.57$$\n\n**2. Loss Frame (“$10\\%$ missed”):**\nUnder this frame, the negative attribute is emphasized. The given attention weights are $\\omega_G = 0.3$ and $\\omega_L = 0.7$.\nThe subjective evaluation, $S_{\\text{loss}}$, is:\n$$S_{\\text{loss}} = (0.3) \\cdot (0.90) + (0.7) \\cdot (-0.20)$$\n$$S_{\\text{loss}} = 0.27 - 0.14 = 0.13$$\n\n**Comparison and Prediction:**\nBy comparing the two evaluations, we find that $S_{\\text{gain}} = 0.57$ is significantly higher than $S_{\\text{loss}} = 0.13$.\n$$S_{\\text{gain}} > S_{\\text{loss}}$$\nThe problem states that screening uptake increases monotonically with the net subjective evaluation. Therefore, uptake will be higher when the test is described using the gain frame (\"$90\\%$ detection\") and lower when it is described using the loss frame (\"$10\\%$ missed\").\n\nThe reason for this difference is twofold, as captured by the model:\n1.  **Framing/Salience Effect**: The loss frame directs more attention to the negative attribute ($\\omega_L$ increases from $0.3$ to $0.7$). This makes the disutility of the missed cases a more prominent part of the overall evaluation.\n2.  **Loss Aversion Effect**: The negative attribute (a $10\\%$ miss) is already disproportionately painful due to loss aversion ($\\lambda=2$), making its value $-0.20$, which has twice the magnitude of a corresponding $10\\%$ gain.\n\nThe combination of increased attention to an already magnified negative attribute drastically reduces the subjective evaluation under the loss frame.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Uptake will be lower when the test is framed as “$10\\%$ missed” than when framed as “$90\\%$ detection,” because the loss frame makes the negative attribute more salient and losses are weighted more heavily than gains.**\nOur derivation shows that uptake is indeed lower in the loss frame ($S_{\\text{loss}} < S_{\\text{gain}}$). The reasoning provided matches the two core principles used in the derivation: frame-induced salience (attention weight $\\omega_L$ is higher in the loss frame) and loss aversion (the loss utility is scaled by $\\lambda > 1$). This option is fully consistent with the model and its premises.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Uptake will be higher when the test is framed as “$10\\%$ missed,” because loss frames always motivate detection behaviors regardless of what is being framed.**\nThis contradicts our finding that uptake is lower in the loss frame. The reasoning is an oversimplification; while some loss frames can be motivating (e.g., framing the consequences of *inaction*), the loss frame in this problem is applied to the *performance of the tool*, making the tool itself seem less appealing.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Uptake will be unchanged, because the descriptions are numerically equivalent and rational patients ignore frames.**\nThis reflects the assumptions of classical rational choice theory, not Prospect Theory. The problem is explicitly framed within Prospect Theory, which posits that frames *do* matter. Our calculation confirms that the subjective evaluation, and thus uptake, is not unchanged ($S_{\\text{gain}} \\neq S_{\\text{loss}}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Uptake will be lower when the test is framed as “$90\\%$ detection” than when framed as “$10\\%$ missed,” because the gain frame makes potential failure more salient than success.**\nThis contradicts our finding that uptake is higher in the gain frame. The reasoning is also factually incorrect according to the problem setup, which states that the gain frame makes the *positive* attribute more salient ($\\omega_G=0.7$), not the failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
