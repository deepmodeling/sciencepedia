In medical psychology, a well-tested readability model, the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), estimates the U.S. school grade level required to understand a text. This model formalizes the empirical observation that longer sentences and more syllables per word increase cognitive load and reduce comprehensibility. The FKGL is computed as a linear function of the average number of words per sentence and the average number of syllables per word. Consider a discharge instruction with a total word count $w=200$, a sentence count $s=10$, and a syllable count $y=300$.

The problem is well-posed, leading to a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by direct application of the provided formula. The FKGL is a function of two ratios: the average number of words per sentence, denoted by $WPS$, and the average number of syllables per word, denoted by $SPW$.\n\nFirst, we calculate these two ratios using the given data.\nThe average number of words per sentence is calculated as:\n$$\nWPS = \\frac{w}{s} = \\frac{200}{10} = 20\n$$\n\nThe average number of syllables per word is calculated as:\n$$\nSPW = \\frac{y}{w} = \\frac{300}{200} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the FKGL formula:\n$$\n\\text{FKGL} = 0.39 \\cdot (WPS) + 11.8 \\cdot (SPW) - 15.59\n$$\n$$\n\\text{FKGL} = 0.39 \\cdot (20) + 11.8 \\cdot (1.5) - 15.59\n$$\n\nWe perform the multiplications:\nThe first term is:\n$$\n0.39 \\times 20 = 7.8\n$$\nThe second term is:\n$$\n11.8 \\times 1.5 = 17.7\n$$\n\nSubstituting these products back into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{FKGL} = 7.8 + 17.7 - 15.59\n$$\n\nNext, we perform the addition:\n$$\n7.8 + 17.7 = 25.5\n$$\n\nFinally, we perform the subtraction:\n$$\n\\text{FKGL} = 25.5 - 15.59 = 9.91\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

Each task is distinct and leads to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n### Solution\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n#### 1) Initial Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)\nThe signal-to-noise ratio in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$) is defined as the difference between the signal level, $L_S$, and the noise level, $L_N$, both expressed in decibels.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = L_S - L_N\n$$\nInitially, the clinician is at a distance of $r_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, producing a speech level of $L_{S,1} = 70\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at the patient's ear. The background noise level is given as $L_N = 65\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. The initial SNR is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{initial}} = L_{S,1} - L_N = 70\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 65\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 5\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nThis initial SNR of $5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ is below the hospital's target of $12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\n#### 2) Distance Calculation for Target SNR\nThe team's strategy involves two changes: deploying the curtain to reduce noise and adjusting the distance to increase the signal level.\n\nFirst, the effect of the curtain is to reduce the background noise level. The new noise level, $L_N'$, is:\n$$\nL_N' = L_N - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}} = 65\\,\\mathrm{dB} - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 62\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nNext, the target SNR is $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{target}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. To achieve this with the new noise level, the speech signal level at the patient's ear, which we will call $L_S(r)$, must satisfy:\n$$\nL_S(r) - L_N' \\ge \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{target}}\n$$\n$$\nL_S(r) \\ge \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{target}} + L_N' = 12\\,\\mathrm{dB} + 62\\,\\mathrm{dB} = 74\\,\\mathrm{dB}\n$$\nSo, a minimum speech level of $L_S(r) = 74\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ is required at the listener.\n\nThe relationship between sound pressure level (SPL) and distance for a point source in a free field (obeying the inverse-square law) is given by:\n$$\nL_S(r) - L_S(r_1) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $L_S(r_1)$ is the known SPL at distance $r_1$, and $L_S(r)$ is the new SPL at the new distance $r$. We are given $L_{S,1} = 70\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ at $r_1 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and require $L_S(r) = 74\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ to achieve the target SNR exactly. We can derive an expression for the distance $r$ that achieves a specific signal-to-noise ratio $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}}$:\n$$\nL_S(r) = \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N' = \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the distance-SPL relation:\n$$\n(\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}}) - L_{S,1} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $r$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r}\\right) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}}) - L_{S,1}}{20}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{r_1}{r} = 10^{\\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N - L_{S,1} - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}}}{20}}\n$$\nThus, the general expression for the distance $r$ is:\n$$\nr = r_1 \\cdot 10^{-\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} + L_N - L_{S,1} - \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}}}{20}\\right)} = r_1 \\cdot 10^{\\frac{L_{S,1} + \\Delta L_{N,\\text{red}} - L_N - \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}}}{20}}\n$$\nTo meet the minimum target SNR of $12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, the clinician must be at a distance $r$ that is less than or equal to the distance calculated for an SNR of exactly $12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This sets the maximum allowable distance, $r_{\\max}$. We substitute the given values with $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{req}} = \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{target}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$:\n$$\nr_{\\max} = (1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot 10^{\\frac{70 + 3.0 - 65 - 12}{20}}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\max} = 10^{\\frac{-4}{20}} = 10^{-0.2}\n$$\n$$\nr_{\\max} \\approx 0.630957... \\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maximum allowable distance is $r_{\\max} = 0.631\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n#### 3) Qualitative Explanation\nThe goal of clear communication in a clinical setting is to maximize speech intelligibility for the patient while minimizing vocal strain for the clinician. Both outcomes are strongly influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the patient's ear.\n\nFrom an **acoustics** perspective, speech intelligibility is highly correlated with SNR. A higher SNR means the speech signal is more distinct from the background noise, making it easier for the auditory system to process. The proposed solution increases SNR through a two-pronged approach:\n1.  **Reducing Noise ($L_N$):** The sound-absorbing curtain lowers the level of the diffuse background noise by $3.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. This directly increases the SNR by $3.0\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ for any given signal level.\n2.  **Increasing Signal ($L_S$):** By reducing the distance from $1.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $0.631\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the clinician increases the speech level at the patient's ear from $70\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ to $74\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ due to the inverse-square law, a $4\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ increase. This is achieved without any increase in the clinician's vocal effort (i.e., source power).\n\nFrom a **medical psychology** perspective, a low SNR forces the patient to exert significant \"listening effort.\" This effort consumes cognitive resources. For a patient who may already be ill, anxious, or have age-related or illness-related cognitive deficits, this increased **cognitive load** can severely impair their ability to understand, process, and retain critical health information. It can lead to misunderstandings, non-adherence to instructions, and increased patient stress. By increasing the SNR from a poor $5\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ to a much better $12\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, the communication becomes less effortful. This frees up the patient's cognitive resources to focus on the content of the message, improving comprehension and recall.\n\nFor the clinician, the hospital policy rightly aims to reduce **vocal strain**. Constantly speaking loudly in a noisy environment leads to vocal fatigue and can cause chronic voice disorders, an occupational hazard in healthcare. The strategy of adjusting distance rather than increasing vocal effort is a key ergonomic intervention. It allows the clinician to achieve the necessary signal level at the listener's ear while maintaining a normal or relaxed vocal output, thereby protecting their long-term vocal health.\n\nIn summary, the combined strategy is effective because it systematically improves the acoustic environment to achieve a target SNR, which directly reduces the patient's cognitive load and improves intelligibility, without forcing the clinician to compromise their own vocal health.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) using the method of natural frequencies for a hypothetical cohort of $1000$ patients. The PPV is the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease, denoted as $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Prevalence, $P(D) = 0.05$.\n-   Sensitivity, $P(T^+|D) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease.\n-   Specificity, $P(T^-|D^c) = 0.95$. This is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease.\n\nWe start with a cohort of $N = 1000$ patients.\n\n1.  **Categorize the cohort by disease status:**\n    -   The number of patients who have the disease is calculated from the prevalence:\n        $$ \\text{Number with disease} = N \\times P(D) = 1000 \\times 0.05 = 50 $$\n    -   The number of patients who do not have the disease is:\n        $$ \\text{Number without disease} = N \\times (1 - P(D)) = 1000 \\times (1 - 0.05) = 1000 \\times 0.95 = 950 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the number of test results for each group:**\n    -   Among the $50$ patients with the disease, we use the sensitivity to find the number of **True Positives (TP)** (those who have the disease and test positive) and **False Negatives (FN)** (those who have the disease but test negative).\n        $$ \\text{TP} = (\\text{Number with disease}) \\times \\text{sensitivity} = 50 \\times 0.90 = 45 $$\n        $$ \\text{FN} = (\\text{Number with disease}) - \\text{TP} = 50 - 45 = 5 $$\n    -   Among the $950$ patients without the disease, we use the specificity to find the number of **True Negatives (TN)** (those who do not have the disease and test negative) and **False Positives (FP)** (those who do not have the disease but test positive). The probability of a positive test in a person without the disease is $1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n        $$ P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n        $$ \\text{FP} = (\\text{Number without disease}) \\times (1 - \\text{specificity}) = 950 \\times 0.05 = 47.5 $$\n        $$ \\text{TN} = (\\text{Number without disease}) \\times \\text{specificity} = 950 \\times 0.95 = 902.5 $$\n\n    Note: The occurrence of non-integer values for the number of people is an artifact of applying probabilities to a finite sample size. This does not invalidate the method, as the final ratio for the PPV will be correct.\n\n3.  **Calculate the total number of positive test results:**\n    The total number of patients who test positive is the sum of True Positives and False Positives.\n    $$ \\text{Total Positives} = \\text{TP} + \\text{FP} = 45 + 47.5 = 92.5 $$\n\n4.  **Compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV):**\n    The PPV is the ratio of the number of True Positives to the total number of positive test results.\n    $$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{Total Positives}} = \\frac{45}{92.5} $$\n    To express this as an exact fraction with integer numerator and denominator, we can multiply both by $10$ and then simplify.\n    $$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{45 \\times 10}{92.5 \\times 10} = \\frac{450}{925} $$\n    Now, we simplify the fraction. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by $25$.\n    $$ \\frac{450 \\div 25}{925 \\div 25} = \\frac{18}{37} $$\n    The number $37$ is prime, so this fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThis result demonstrates the core issue of communicating test results: despite a test with high sensitivity ($90\\%$) and specificity ($95\\%$), a positive result in this population only corresponds to a probability of $\\frac{18}{37}$ (approximately $48.6\\%$) that the patient actually has the disease.
