            "introduction": "Understanding the theoretical models of the patient-practitioner relationship is the first step, but the real skill lies in identifying them in action. This practice challenges you to analyze a realistic clinical scenario where a patient expresses a clear, yet nuanced, preference for how a medical decision should be made. By matching the patient's request for high information but low decisional involvement to its corresponding theoretical model , you will sharpen your ability to diagnose the appropriate relational stance required in complex clinical encounters.",

            "problem": "A patient-practitioner encounter is observed in which an adult patient states: “I want to hear all the facts about my condition and the options, but I do not want to make the final choice; please recommend and decide for me.” The clinician plans to respect the ethical commitments to autonomy, informed consent, and beneficence by ensuring extensive disclosure and comprehension, yet the patient explicitly prefers to delegate decisional authority. Using a principled taxonomy of patient-practitioner relationship models grounded in core definitions of autonomy, informed consent, and role allocation, choose the model that best fits the pattern of high information access with low patient decisional involvement. Your selection should be based on identifying which model, by definition, concentrates decisional control with the clinician while maintaining open information exchange, and on why adjacent models that alter either information disclosure or locus of decisional control are suboptimal for this scenario.\n\nWhich model best fits this encounter?\n\nA. Informative (consumer) model: the clinician provides comprehensive information and the patient, as autonomous chooser, selects the intervention.\n\nB. Guidance–Cooperation model (Szasz and Hollender): the clinician recommends and guides; the patient cooperates after being informed, with low patient decisional control.\n\nC. Paternalistic model: the clinician acts as a guardian, minimizes or restricts information as needed, and makes the decision for the patient.\n\nD. Deliberative model: the clinician acts as teacher/friend to help the patient articulate and refine health-related values so that the patient makes an informed, value-aligned choice.",
            "solution": "To determine the best-fit model, we must deconstruct the patient's request into two components: information flow and decisional control.\n\n1.  **Information Flow:** The patient states, \"I want to hear all the facts about my condition and the options.\" This indicates a desire for a **high level of information disclosure** from the practitioner.\n\n2.  **Decisional Control:** The patient also states, \"...but I do not want to make the final choice; please recommend and decide for me.\" This is an explicit delegation of decisional authority, indicating a preference for **low patient decisional involvement** and high practitioner control.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided models against these two criteria (high information, low patient control):\n\n*   **A. Informative (consumer) model:** This model involves high information disclosure, but it posits the patient as the \"autonomous chooser.\" This contradicts the patient's request to delegate the decision.\n*   **C. Paternalistic model:** This model places decisional control with the clinician, but it often involves minimizing or restricting information to guide the patient's assent. This contradicts the patient's explicit request for \"all the facts.\"\n*   **D. Deliberative model:** This model involves high information and discussion, but its goal is to empower the patient to make their own value-aligned choice. This contradicts the patient's desire not to make the final choice.\n*   **B. Guidance–Cooperation model:** In this model, the practitioner provides information and guidance (a recommendation), and the patient, being informed, is expected to cooperate with the clinician's decision. This model perfectly aligns with the patient's request for full information followed by the clinician making the decision. The patient exercises their autonomy by choosing to trust and delegate authority to the practitioner.\n\nTherefore, the Guidance–Cooperation model is the best fit for this scenario.",

            "introduction": "The choice of a patient-practitioner model is not just an abstract ethical decision; it has a direct, measurable impact on patient understanding and choices. This exercise demonstrates how different communication styles, associated with different relationship models, can alter a patient's decision by framing risk in either relative or absolute terms. By calculating key risk metrics and then using the Cohen's kappa coefficient to assess the stability of patient preferences , you will gain a hands-on appreciation for how communication techniques can either anchor or shift patient decisions.",

            "problem": "A practitioner is working with a patient on a preventive therapy decision under two communication approaches aligned with distinct models of the patient-practitioner relationship in medical psychology. In the first encounter, the practitioner uses a relatively directive style that emphasizes a relative risk frame, characteristic of a more paternalistic orientation: the patient is told the therapy provides a $25\\%$ reduction in the chance of a cardiovascular event. In the second encounter, the practitioner applies an informative, shared decision-making approach that emphasizes absolute risk information: the practitioner converts the same evidence into absolute terms and articulates both the absolute risk reduction and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), where NNT stands for Number Needed to Treat.\n\nThe underlying epidemiological parameters are a baseline event probability without therapy of $p_{0} = 0.12$ and a relative risk reduction of $r = 0.25$. In a cohort of $200$ matched patients, initial preferences under the relative frame and subsequent preferences after the absolute frame were recorded as a paired binary choice: accept therapy or decline therapy. The joint distribution of preferences across the two framing conditions is as follows, where each cell reports the count of patients:\n\n- Accepted therapy under both frames: $110$.\n- Accepted therapy under the relative frame but declined under the absolute frame: $30$.\n- Declined therapy under the relative frame but accepted under the absolute frame: $10$.\n- Declined therapy under both frames: $50$.\n\nUsing a principled, first-principles approach grounded in standard definitions of risk, convert the risk communication from relative to absolute terms for interpretive context. Then, quantify the stability of patient preferences across framing conditions by calculating the chance-corrected agreement using the Cohen's kappa coefficient. Report only the stability coefficient as your final answer. Round your final answer to three significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological and statistical principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe first step is to provide context by converting the relative risk information into absolute terms. The problem provides the baseline event probability without therapy, $p_{0} = 0.12$, and the relative risk reduction, $r = 0.25$.\n\nThe relative risk reduction ($r$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk in the treated group compared to the control group. It is expressed as $r = \\frac{p_{0} - p_{1}}{p_{0}}$, where $p_{1}$ is the event probability with therapy. We can rearrange this to solve for $p_{1}$:\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} \\times (1 - r)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$p_{1} = 0.12 \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.12 \\times 0.75 = 0.09$$\nSo, the event probability with therapy is $9\\%$.\n\nThe practitioner communicates this using two key absolute risk metrics: the Absolute Risk Reduction ($\\text{ARR}$) and the Number Needed to Treat ($\\text{NNT}$).\n\nThe $\\text{ARR}$ is the simple difference between the event probabilities in the control and treated groups:\n$$\\text{ARR} = p_{0} - p_{1}$$\n$$\\text{ARR} = 0.12 - 0.09 = 0.03$$\nThis means the therapy provides a $3$ percentage point reduction in the risk of the cardiovascular event.\n\nThe $\\text{NNT}$ is the reciprocal of the $\\text{ARR}$, representing the average number of patients who need to be treated to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARR}}$$\n$$\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.03} \\approx 33.33$$\nThis means approximately $34$ patients must receive the therapy for one of them to avoid the event who would have otherwise experienced it.\n\nThe main task is to quantify the stability of patient preferences across the two framing conditions (relative vs. absolute risk) using the Cohen's kappa coefficient, $\\kappa$. The kappa coefficient measures inter-rater agreement for categorical items, corrected for the agreement that would be expected by chance. Here, the \"raters\" are the two different framing conditions.\n\nThe formula for Cohen's kappa is:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{p_{o} - p_{e}}{1 - p_{e}}$$\nwhere $p_{o}$ is the observed proportional agreement, and $p_{e}$ is the hypothetical probability of chance agreement.\n\nWe first construct a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table from the given data. Let the rows represent the preference under the relative risk frame (RF) and the columns represent the preference under the absolute risk frame (AF). The choices are \"Accept\" and \"Decline\".\n\nThe counts are:\n- Accept (RF) and Accept (AF): $a = 110$\n- Accept (RF) and Decline (AF): $b = 30$\n- Decline (RF) and Accept (AF): $c = 10$\n- Decline (RF) and Decline (AF): $d = 50$\n\nThe total number of patients is $N = a + b + c + d = 110 + 30 + 10 + 50 = 200$.\n\nThe contingency table with marginal totals is:\n| | AF: Accept | AF: Decline | Row Total |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **RF: Accept** | 110 | 30 | 140 |\n| **RF: Decline**| 10 | 50 | 60 |\n| **Column Total**| 120 | 80 | 200 |\n\nNext, we calculate $p_{o}$, the observed proportional agreement. Agreement occurs when patients made the same choice under both frames (Accept/Accept or Decline/Decline).\nThe number of observed agreements is $a + d = 110 + 50 = 160$.\nThe proportion of observed agreement is:\n$$p_{o} = \\frac{a + d}{N} = \\frac{160}{200} = 0.80$$\n\nNext, we calculate $p_{e}$, the proportion of agreement expected by chance. This is the sum of the probabilities of the two types of agreement (Accept/Accept and Decline/Decline) occurring by chance, based on the marginal distributions.\nThe probability of a patient accepting under RF is $P(\\text{RF=Accept}) = \\frac{140}{200} = 0.70$.\nThe probability of a patient declining under RF is $P(\\text{RF=Decline}) = \\frac{60}{200} = 0.30$.\nThe probability of a patient accepting under AF is $P(\\text{AF=Accept}) = \\frac{120}{200} = 0.60$.\nThe probability of a patient declining under AF is $P(\\text{AF=Decline}) = \\frac{80}{200} = 0.40$.\n\nThe probability of agreeing on \"Accept\" by chance is:\n$$P_e(\\text{Accept}) = P(\\text{RF=Accept}) \\times P(\\text{AF=Accept}) = 0.70 \\times 0.60 = 0.42$$\nThe probability of agreeing on \"Decline\" by chance is:\n$$P_e(\\text{Decline}) = P(\\text{RF=Decline}) \\times P(\\text{AF=Decline}) = 0.30 \\times 0.40 = 0.12$$\nThe total probability of chance agreement is the sum of these:\n$$p_{e} = P_e(\\text{Accept}) + P_e(\\text{Decline}) = 0.42 + 0.12 = 0.54$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the Cohen's kappa coefficient:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{p_{o} - p_{e}}{1 - p_{e}}$$\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{0.80 - 0.54}{1 - 0.54} = \\frac{0.26}{0.46}$$\n$$\\kappa \\approx 0.565217...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\\kappa \\approx 0.565$$\nThis value represents a moderate level of agreement between the preferences expressed under the two different risk communication frames, indicating that the framing of the risk information has a substantial effect on patient decisions.",

            "introduction": "Shared Decision Making (SDM) is more than a conversation; it can be formalized into a powerful analytical tool that personalizes care. This problem guides you through the process of building a decision model from first principles, using the framework of expected utility theory to balance the risks of a disease against the risks and burdens of treatment . By deriving a threshold based on the patient's unique values—represented by their personal disutility for different outcomes—you will see how to translate the principles of SDM into a precise, patient-centered mathematical rule.",

            "problem": "A clinician and a patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) engage in Shared Decision Making (SDM) to consider initiating long-term oral anticoagulation. The patient’s annual baseline probability of ischemic stroke without anticoagulation is denoted by $p_{s}^{N}$, and the annual baseline probability of a major bleed without anticoagulation is denoted by $p_{b}^{N}$. With anticoagulation, stroke risk is reduced by a relative risk reduction $r_{s}$, so the annual stroke probability on anticoagulation is $p_{s}^{A} = (1 - r_{s}) p_{s}^{N}$ with $0 < r_{s} < 1$. Major bleeding risk on anticoagulation is increased by a relative risk multiplier $q_{b} > 1$, so the annual major bleeding probability is $p_{b}^{A} = q_{b} p_{b}^{N}$.\n\nLet $u(\\text{stroke}) = u_{s}$ and $u(\\text{bleed}) = u_{b}$ denote the patient’s utility losses associated with experiencing a stroke or a major bleed, respectively, measured over the annual decision horizon (for example, in quality-adjusted life-year loss units for that year). Let $b$ denote the annual disutility of being on anticoagulation (treatment burden), independent of events. Assume expected utility maximization, where the expected annual utility loss is the sum of the products of event probabilities and their corresponding utility losses, plus any treatment burden when applicable.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of expected utility and absolute risk change, derive the decision rule under which anticoagulation is preferred (i.e., yields a lower expected annual utility loss than no anticoagulation). Then, solve this decision rule for the threshold utility ratio $T = \\frac{u_{s}}{u_{b}}$ that makes the patient indifferent between anticoagulation and no anticoagulation. Express $T$ in closed form in terms of $p_{s}^{N}$, $r_{s}$, $p_{b}^{N}$, $q_{b}$, $u_{b}$, and $b$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $T$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no units should be included in the final expression.",
