            "introduction": "In medical settings, screening tools are essential for identifying potential cases of depression, but their results are not definitive. This is especially true in populations with physical illness, where symptoms can overlap. This exercise uses Bayes' theorem to move beyond a simple positive or negative result, allowing you to calculate the actual probability that a patient has depression after a positive screen. Mastering this helps you interpret diagnostic information with greater accuracy, a critical skill in integrated care .",

            "problem": "In a cardiology outpatient clinic with high comorbidity between cardiovascular disease and depressive disorders, suppose the true point prevalence of current major depressive disorder is $\\pi = 0.25$. Patients are screened with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), which at the chosen cut-off yields sensitivity $Se = 0.85$ and specificity $Sp = 0.80$. For a patient who screens positive, use only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence (as pretest probability), the law of total probability, and Bayes’ theorem to derive from first principles an expression for the posterior probability of depression given a positive screen, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $\\pi$. Then compute its numerical value for this clinic. Round your numerical answer to four significant figures and express it as a decimal. Finally, state whether a stepped-care threshold that initiates low-intensity psychological treatment when the posterior probability exceeds $0.5$ would be met on average in this setting. Report only the posterior probability as your final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that a patient has major depressive disorder, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not. Let $T^+$ be the event that a patient screens positive on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We are asked to derive an expression for the posterior probability of depression given a positive screen, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, and then compute its value.\n\nThe givens are:\n1.  The true prevalence of the disorder, which is the prior probability of having the disease: $\\pi = P(D) = 0.25$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive screen given the patient has the disease: $Se = P(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative screen given the patient does not have the disease: $Sp = P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 0.80$.\n\nOur objective is to find $P(D \\mid T^{+})$, also known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV).\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability is given by:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^{+})}\n$$\n\nThe numerator is the product of the sensitivity and the prevalence, which are both given:\n$$\nP(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) = Se \\cdot \\pi\n$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the overall probability of a positive screen. We can express this using the law of total probability, which states that we can find the total probability of an event by summing its probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. Here, the exhaustive set is $\\{D, D^c\\}$.\n$$\nP(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\n\nWe need to express each term in this expansion using the given quantities $Se$, $Sp$, and $\\pi$.\n-   $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$.\n-   $P(D)$ is the prevalence, $\\pi$.\n-   $P(D^c)$ is the probability of not having the disease, which is $1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\n-   $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive screen given the patient does not have the disease. This is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since specificity is $P(T^{-} \\mid D^c)$, and a test result must be either positive or negative, we have $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) + P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 1$. Therefore, $P(T^{+} \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^{-} \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^{+}) = (Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this full expression for the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to obtain the final derived expression for $P(D \\mid T^{+})$:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{(Se \\cdot \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi))}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the posterior probability derived from first principles as required.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $\\pi = 0.25$, $Se = 0.85$, and $Sp = 0.80$.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = Se \\cdot \\pi = 0.85 \\times 0.25 = 0.2125\n$$\n\nNext, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n-   The first term is the same as the numerator: $Se \\cdot \\pi = 0.2125$.\n-   The second term is the probability of a false positive: $(1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - \\pi) = (1 - 0.80) \\times (1 - 0.25) = 0.20 \\times 0.75 = 0.1500$.\n\nNow, calculate the denominator by summing these two terms:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = P(T^{+}) = 0.2125 + 0.1500 = 0.3625\n$$\n\nFinally, compute the posterior probability:\n$$\nP(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.2125}{0.3625} \\approx 0.58620689655...\n$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.5862$.\n\nThe problem also asks whether a stepped-care threshold that initiates treatment when the posterior probability exceeds $0.5$ would be met. Since our calculated posterior probability is $P(D \\mid T^{+}) \\approx 0.5862$, which is greater than $0.5$, the threshold for initiating low-intensity psychological treatment would be met on average for patients who screen positive in this clinic setting. The final answer to be reported is only the numerical value of the posterior probability.",

In this comorbid population, depression management is hypothesized to reduce subsequent cardiac rehospitalization by modifying the probability of the event, consistent with well-tested clinical epidemiology concepts. Let the usual-care baseline $90$-day cardiac rehospitalization risk be $0.30$ for this population, and assume the intervention operates multiplicatively on risk such that the relative risk $RR$ of rehospitalization under collaborative care versus usual care is $RR=0.85$. Using core definitions from clinical epidemiology that connect event probabilities, relative risk, absolute risk reduction, and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), derive the expression for the NNT in terms of the baseline risk and the relative risk, and then compute its numeric value for the given $RR$ and baseline risk. Round your final answer to two significant figures and report it as a pure number without any units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) in terms of baseline risk and relative risk, followed by a numerical calculation for the given values. We begin by defining the primary epidemiological measures involved.\n\nLet $P_{uc}$ be the probability of the adverse event (in this case, $90$-day cardiac rehospitalization) in the control group (usual care). This is the baseline risk.\nLet $P_{cc}$ be the probability of the event in the treatment group (collaborative care).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The baseline risk: $P_{uc} = 0.30$.\n- The relative risk of the event for the treatment group compared to the control group: $RR = 0.85$.\n\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of the risk of the event in the treatment group to the risk in the control group:\n$$RR = \\frac{P_{cc}}{P_{uc}}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can express the risk in the treatment group as:\n$$P_{cc} = RR \\times P_{uc}$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is the difference in risk between the control and treatment groups. It quantifies the absolute effect of the intervention.\n$$ARR = P_{uc} - P_{cc}$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse event compared to the control group. A positive $NNT$ is defined for interventions that are beneficial, meaning $P_{uc}  P_{cc}$.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $NNT$ in terms of the baseline risk ($P_{uc}$) and the relative risk ($RR$), we substitute the expressions for $ARR$ and $P_{cc}$ into the equation for $NNT$.\n\nFirst, substitute the definition of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc} - P_{cc}}$$\n\nNext, substitute the expression for $P_{cc}$ in terms of $P_{uc}$ and $RR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc} - (RR \\times P_{uc})}$$\n\nFactoring out the baseline risk $P_{uc}$ from the denominator gives the desired general expression:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{P_{uc}(1 - RR)}$$\nThis equation expresses the $NNT$ solely in terms of the baseline risk and the relative risk, as required.\n\nNow, we compute the numeric value of the $NNT$ using the provided data: $P_{uc} = 0.30$ and $RR = 0.85$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.30 \\times (1 - 0.85)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\nThen, we compute the denominator:\n$$0.30 \\times 0.15 = 0.045$$\nFinally, we calculate the reciprocal:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.045} \\approx 22.222...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $22.222...$ has its first two significant figures as $2$ and $2$. The third digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nTherefore, the rounded value for the $NNT$ is $22$.
