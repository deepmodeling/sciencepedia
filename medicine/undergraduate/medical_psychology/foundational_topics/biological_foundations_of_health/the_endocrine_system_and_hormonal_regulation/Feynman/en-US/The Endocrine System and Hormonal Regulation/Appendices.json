The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. The constraints are self-contained and consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general relationship between receptor occupancy fraction ($f$), free ligand concentration ($[L]$), and the dissociation constant ($K_d$), as requested. The definition of occupancy fraction is:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_T}$$\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of unbound and bound receptors:\n$$[R]_T = [R] + [RL]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nThe definition of the dissociation constant is $K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$. We can rearrange this to express the unbound receptor concentration $[R]$ in terms of other variables:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} + [RL]}$$\nThe term $[RL]$ is common to all terms in the denominator, so it can be factored out:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left( \\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1 \\right)}$$\nCanceling $[RL]$ from the numerator and denominator yields the expression:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ gives the conventional form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site:\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis equation links the receptor occupancy fraction $f$ to the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nThe next step is to use the data from the wild-type individuals to calculate the critical occupancy fraction $f^{\\ast}$ at which memory impairment occurs. First, we determine the free cortisol concentration in the hippocampus, $[L]^{\\text{WT}}$, which corresponds to the total plasma cortisol $C_T^{\\text{WT}}$. The free cortisol fraction is given as $\\phi=0.08$.\n$$[L]^{\\text{WT}} = \\phi \\times C_T^{\\text{WT}}$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$[L]^{\\text{WT}} = 0.08 \\times 500\\,\\text{nM} = 40\\,\\text{nM}$$\nNow we can compute $f^{\\ast}$ using the derived occupancy equation with the wild-type parameters, $K_d^{\\text{WT}} = 10\\,\\text{nM}$ and $[L]^{\\text{WT}} = 40\\,\\text{nM}$.\n$$f^{\\ast} = \\frac{[L]^{\\text{WT}}}{K_d^{\\text{WT}} + [L]^{\\text{WT}}} = \\frac{40\\,\\text{nM}}{10\\,\\text{nM} + 40\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{40}{50} = 0.8$$\nThe critical fraction for memory impairment is $f^{\\ast} = 0.8$. This value is stated to be genotype-invariant.\n\nThe final step is to determine the total plasma cortisol concentration, $C_T^{\\text{MUT}}$, required to reach this same critical occupancy fraction $f^{\\ast} = 0.8$ in individuals with the polymorphism. First, we calculate the dissociation constant for the mutant receptor, $K_d^{\\text{MUT}}$.\n$$K_d^{\\text{MUT}} = 1.5 \\times K_d^{\\text{WT}} = 1.5 \\times 10\\,\\text{nM} = 15\\,\\text{nM}$$\nNow, we use the occupancy equation to solve for the required free cortisol concentration in the hippocampus, $[L]^{\\text{MUT}}$, for the mutant genotype to reach $f^{\\ast}$.\n$$f^{\\ast} = \\frac{[L]^{\\text{MUT}}}{K_d^{\\text{MUT}} + [L]^{\\text{MUT}}}$$\n$$0.8 = \\frac{[L]^{\\text{MUT}}}{15\\,\\text{nM} + [L]^{\\text{MUT}}}$$\nTo solve for $[L]^{\\text{MUT}}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$0.8 \\times (15\\,\\text{nM} + [L]^{\\text{MUT}}) = [L]^{\\text{MUT}}$$\n$$12\\,\\text{nM} + 0.8 [L]^{\\text{MUT}} = [L]^{\\text{MUT}}$$\n$$12\\,\\text{nM} = [L]^{\\text{MUT}} - 0.8 [L]^{\\text{MUT}}$$\n$$12\\,\\text{nM} = 0.2 [L]^{\\text{MUT}}$$\n$$[L]^{\\text{MUT}} = \\frac{12\\,\\text{nM}}{0.2} = 60\\,\\text{nM}$$\nThis is the free cortisol concentration required in the hippocampus. To find the corresponding total plasma cortisol concentration, $C_T^{\\text{MUT}}$, we use the constant free fraction $\\phi = 0.08$.\n$$[L]^{\\text{MUT}} = \\phi \\times C_T^{\\text{MUT}}$$\n$$C_T^{\\text{MUT}} = \\frac{[L]^{\\text{MUT}}}{\\phi} = \\frac{60\\,\\text{nM}}{0.08}$$\n$$C_T^{\\text{MUT}} = 750\\,\\text{nM}$$\nThe calculation yields an exact integer, $750$. The problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The number $750$ has three significant figures if the trailing zero is considered significant, which is standard for an exact result that happens to end in zero. Thus, the final answer is $750$.",

At steady-state, all time derivatives are zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dT_4}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dT_3}{dt} = 0\n$$\nLet the steady-state concentrations be denoted by $S^*$, $T_4^*$, and $T_3^*$.\n\nFrom the equation for the dynamics of $T_4$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_4}{dt} = k_4 S - c_4 T_4 = 0 \\implies k_4 S^* = c_4 T_4^*\n$$\nSolving for $T_4^*$ in terms of $S^*$:\n$$\nT_4^* = \\frac{k_4}{c_4} S^*\n$$\nSimilarly, from the equation for the dynamics of $T_3$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_3}{dt} = k_3 S - c_3 T_3 = 0 \\implies k_3 S^* = c_3 T_3^*\n$$\nSolving for $T_3^*$ in terms of $S^*$:\n$$\nT_3^* = \\frac{k_3}{c_3} S^*\n$$\nNext, we determine the steady-state pituitary intracellular T3 concentration, $T_3^{\\text{pit}*}$, by substituting the expressions for $T_4^*$ and $T_3^*$ into the algebraic relation provided:\n$$\nT_3^{\\text{pit}*} = T_3^* + \\lambda k_{d2} T_4^* = \\left(\\frac{k_3}{c_3}\\right)S^* + \\lambda k_{d2} \\left(\\frac{k_4}{c_4}\\right)S^*\n$$\nWe can factor out $S^*$ to express $T_3^{\\text{pit}*}$ as a linear function of $S^*$:\n$$\nT_3^{\\text{pit}*} = \\left( \\frac{k_3}{c_3} + \\frac{\\lambda k_{d2} k_4}{c_4} \\right) S^*\n$$\nLet us define a composite parameter $\\gamma$ for the term in parentheses:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{k_3}{c_3} + \\frac{\\lambda k_{d2} k_4}{c_4}\n$$\nSo, we have $T_3^{\\text{pit}*} = \\gamma S^*$.\n\nFinally, we use the steady-state condition for the TSH dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = k_S \\frac{R}{1 + \\beta (T_3^{\\text{pit}*})^{n}} - c_S S^* = 0\n$$\nThis gives:\n$$\nc_S S^* = \\frac{k_S R}{1 + \\beta (T_3^{\\text{pit}*})^{n}}\n$$\nSubstitute $T_3^{\\text{pit}*} = \\gamma S^*$ and the given value $n=1$ into this equation:\n$$\nc_S S^* = \\frac{k_S R}{1 + \\beta (\\gamma S^*)^1} = \\frac{k_S R}{1 + \\beta \\gamma S^*}\n$$\nTo solve for $S^*$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nc_S S^* (1 + \\beta \\gamma S^*) = k_S R\n$$\n$$\nc_S S^* + c_S \\beta \\gamma (S^*)^2 = k_S R\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $S^*$. Rearranging it into standard form $Ax^2 + Bx + C = 0$:\n$$\n(c_S \\beta \\gamma) (S^*)^2 + (c_S) S^* - k_S R = 0\n$$\nThe solution is given by the quadratic formula, $S^* = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, where $A = c_S \\beta \\gamma$, $B = c_S$, and $C = -k_S R$.\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-c_S \\pm \\sqrt{c_S^2 - 4(c_S \\beta \\gamma)(-k_S R)}}{2(c_S \\beta \\gamma)}\n$$\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-c_S \\pm \\sqrt{c_S^2 + 4 c_S \\beta \\gamma k_S R}}{2 c_S \\beta \\gamma}\n$$\nSince concentration $S^*$ must be a positive quantity, and all parameters ($c_S, \\beta, \\gamma, k_S, R$) are positive, the term under the square root is greater than $c_S$. Thus, we must choose the positive root to ensure $S^* > 0$.\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-c_S + \\sqrt{c_S^2 + 4 c_S \\beta \\gamma k_S R}}{2 c_S \\beta \\gamma}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form symbolic solution. Now, we substitute the numerical values. First, we compute the composite parameter $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{k_3}{c_3} + \\frac{\\lambda k_{d2} k_4}{c_4} = \\frac{0.5}{1.0} + \\frac{(1.0)(0.5)(1.0)}{1.0} = 0.5 + 0.5 = 1.0\n$$\nThe units of $\\gamma$ are $(\\text{nmol}/\\text{L})/(\\text{mU}/\\text{L})$, or $\\text{nmol}\\cdot\\text{mU}^{-1}$.\n\nNow we substitute the values into the coefficients of the quadratic equation:\n- $A = c_S \\beta \\gamma = (1.0)(1.0)(1.0) = 1.0$\n- $B = c_S = 1.0$\n- $C = -k_S R = -(2.0)(2.0) = -4.0$\n\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n1.0 (S^*)^2 + 1.0 S^* - 4.0 = 0\n$$\nApplying the quadratic formula with these coefficients:\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-1.0 \\pm \\sqrt{(1.0)^2 - 4(1.0)(-4.0)}}{2(1.0)} = \\frac{-1.0 \\pm \\sqrt{1.0 + 16.0}}{2.0} = \\frac{-1.0 \\pm \\sqrt{17.0}}{2.0}\n$$\nAgain, choosing the positive root for a physically meaningful solution:\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-1.0 + \\sqrt{17.0}}{2.0}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\sqrt{17.0} \\approx 4.1231056256\n$$\n$$\nS^* = \\frac{-1.0 + 4.1231056256}{2.0} = \\frac{3.1231056256}{2.0} = 1.5615528128\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nS^* \\approx 1.562\n$$\nThe final answer is $1.562\\ \\text{mU}/\\text{L}$.",
