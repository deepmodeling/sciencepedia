            "problem": "A healthy advanced-undergraduate participant in a laboratory stress paradigm is evaluated within the framework of Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome, which posits an initial alarm reaction characterized by activation of the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis and consequent cortisol secretion, followed by resistance and recovery phases. To quantify the magnitude of HPA activation attributable to the stressor beyond pre-stress baseline, researchers often compute the Area Under the Curve (AUC) with respect to increase, denoted AUC with respect to increase (AUCi). Let the cortisol concentration be a time-dependent function $c(t)$ measured in $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$ and the baseline be a constant $b$ measured in $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$. By definition, AUCi over an observation window $[t_0, t_n]$ is the time integral of the increase above baseline, that is, $\\int_{t_0}^{t_n} \\big(c(t) - b\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$. In an empirical study, salivary cortisol was sampled at $t=0$, $t=30$, and $t=60$ minutes, yielding values $[10, 20, 14]$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$, with baseline $b=10$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$. Assume $c(t)$ changes linearly between sampling points.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definition of AUCi as the time integral of $c(t) - b$ and the assumption of linear change between samples, compute the AUCi for this observation window. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{nmol\\cdot min/L}$. Provide a single real-valued number; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Framework: Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome.\n- Quantity to compute: Area Under the Curve with respect to increase (AUCi).\n- Cortisol concentration function: $c(t)$, measured in $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- Baseline cortisol: a constant $b$, measured in $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- Definition of AUCi: $\\int_{t_0}^{t_n} \\big(c(t) - b\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\n- Observation window: $[t_0, t_n]$.\n- Sampling times: $t=0$, $t=30$, and $t=60$ minutes.\n- Cortisol concentrations at sampling times: $[10, 20, 14]$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- Baseline value: $b=10$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- Assumption: $c(t)$ changes linearly between sampling points.\n- Required units for the final answer: $\\mathrm{nmol\\cdot min/L}$.\n- Required answer format: A single real-valued number.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses standard concepts from psychoneuroendocrinology, including Selye's GAS, the HPA axis, cortisol measurement, and the AUCi calculation method. The provided cortisol values are physiologically plausible for a response to a laboratory stressor. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary information is provided. The function $c(t)$ is uniquely determined as a piecewise linear function by the given data points. The baseline $b$ is specified. The integral to be computed is explicitly defined. A unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The baseline $b=10$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$ happens to be equal to the initial cortisol value $c(0)=10$ $\\mathrm{nmol/L}$, which is a common scenario but not a contradiction.\n- **Feasibility:** The conditions and data are realistic and consistent with empirical research in the field.\n- **Structure:** The problem is clearly structured and asks for a specific calculation based on a provided definition and dataset.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Area Under the Curve with respect to increase (AUCi), which is defined as the integral of the cortisol concentration $c(t)$ minus a constant baseline $b$ over a specified time interval $[t_0, t_n]$.\nThe explicit definition given is:\n$$ \\text{AUCi} = \\int_{t_0}^{t_n} \\big(c(t) - b\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nThe provided data are:\n- Time points: $t_0 = 0\\,\\mathrm{min}$, $t_1 = 30\\,\\mathrm{min}$, $t_2 = 60\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- Cortisol concentrations at these times: $c(t_0) = 10\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$, $c(t_1) = 20\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$, $c(t_2) = 14\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- Baseline: $b = 10\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n- The observation window is $[t_0, t_2] = [0, 60]$.\n\nThe assumption is that $c(t)$ changes linearly between sampling points. This means $c(t)$ is a piecewise linear function. The integral can be broken down into segments corresponding to the linear pieces:\n$$ \\text{AUCi} = \\int_{0}^{60} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{30} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{30}^{60} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nThe definite integral of a linear function over an interval $[a, b]$ corresponds to the area of a trapezoid. The area of a trapezoid with base $(b-a)$ and parallel sides $h_1$ and $h_2$ is given by $\\frac{h_1 + h_2}{2}(b-a)$.\nIn our case, the function being integrated is $f(t) = c(t) - b = c(t) - 10$. First, we compute the values of this function at the given time points:\n- At $t_0 = 0$: $f(0) = c(0) - b = 10 - 10 = 0$.\n- At $t_1 = 30$: $f(30) = c(30) - b = 20 - 10 = 10$.\n- At $t_2 = 60$: $f(60) = c(60) - b = 14 - 10 = 4$.\n\nNow, we can compute the integral for each segment using the trapezoidal area formula.\n\nFor the first interval, $[0, 30]$:\nThe integral corresponds to the area of a trapezoid with a base of width $t_1 - t_0 = 30 - 0 = 30$ and parallel side heights of $f(0) = 0$ and $f(30) = 10$.\n$$ \\text{AUCi}_1 = \\int_{0}^{30} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{f(0) + f(30)}{2} \\times (t_1 - t_0) $$\n$$ \\text{AUCi}_1 = \\frac{0 + 10}{2} \\times (30) = 5 \\times 30 = 150 $$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{nmol/L}) \\times (\\mathrm{min})$.\n\nFor the second interval, $[30, 60]$:\nThe integral corresponds to the area of a trapezoid with a base of width $t_2 - t_1 = 60 - 30 = 30$ and parallel side heights of $f(30) = 10$ and $f(60) = 4$.\n$$ \\text{AUCi}_2 = \\int_{30}^{60} (c(t) - 10)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{f(30) + f(60)}{2} \\times (t_2 - t_1) $$\n$$ \\text{AUCi}_2 = \\frac{10 + 4}{2} \\times (30) = \\frac{14}{2} \\times 30 = 7 \\times 30 = 210 $$\nThe units are also $(\\mathrm{nmol/L}) \\times (\\mathrm{min})$.\n\nThe total AUCi is the sum of the areas from the two intervals:\n$$ \\text{AUCi} = \\text{AUCi}_1 + \\text{AUCi}_2 = 150 + 210 = 360 $$\nThe final answer is $360$ with units of $\\mathrm{nmol\\cdot min/L}$.\nIt is noteworthy that the problem's explicit definition of AUCi, $\\int_{t_0}^{t_n} \\big(c(t) - b\\big)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, would allow for negative contributions if $c(t)$ were to fall below $b$. In some literature, AUCi is defined to only accumulate area where $c(t)>b$. However, for this problem, the function $c(t)$ is always greater than or equal to the baseline $b=10$ over the entire interval $[0, 60]$, so this distinction is moot. We strictly follow the provided definition.\n$c(t)$ on $[0, 30]$ is $c(t) = \\frac{10}{30}t + 10 \\ge 10$.\n$c(t)$ on $[30, 60]$ is a line connecting $(30, 20)$ and $(60, 14)$, which is always above $10$.\nThus, the calculation stands.",

            "introduction": "The ultimate failure of adaptation in the Exhaustion stage has profound consequences for both health and performance. This final practice challenges you to integrate Selye's GAS with another foundational concept in psychology, the Yerkes–Dodson principle, which relates arousal to performance. By analyzing the case of a hospital resident under prolonged stress, you will reason through how the transition from Resistance to Exhaustion leads to a predictable decline in cognitive function, providing a richer, more holistic understanding of the costs of chronic stress .",
            "id": "4744796",
            "problem": "A hospital resident is assigned to coordinate a prolonged mass-casualty response. Consider two widely accepted bases. First, the Yerkes–Dodson principle: task performance $P$ varies nonlinearly with arousal $A$ such that there exists an optimal arousal $A^{\\ast}$ at which $P(A)$ is maximized; for $A<A^{\\ast}$ or $A>A^{\\ast}$, performance declines. Second, Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS): the organism’s response to a sustained stressor proceeds through an initial Alarm stage (rapid activation of the Sympathetic–Adreno–Medullary (SAM) system and the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis), a Resistance stage (continued mobilization with counter-regulation to maintain function), and an Exhaustion stage (failure of adaptive mechanisms with resource depletion and dysregulation).\n\nAssume the resident is performing a complex cognitive task. Let $t$ denote time under sustained stress, arousal be $A(t)$, and performance be $P(A(t))$. Without assuming a specific formula for $P$, except that it is unimodal with a unique maximum at $A^{\\ast}$, reason from these bases to identify the GAS transition at which the resident’s performance is most likely to begin a sustained decline specifically because Resistance is failing. Choose the option that best maps the Yerkes–Dodson principle onto the GAS stages and identifies the most plausible transition point for this decline.\n\nA. The decline begins at the transition from Alarm to Resistance, because adaptation reduces arousal below $A^{\\ast}$, moving leftward on the Yerkes–Dodson curve.\n\nB. The decline begins at the transition from Resistance to Exhaustion, because sustained high arousal with failing adaptive resources pushes the system beyond $A^{\\ast}$ and onto the descending limb of the Yerkes–Dodson curve.\n\nC. The decline begins at the onset of Alarm, because the immediate catecholamine surge overshoots $A^{\\ast}$ for complex tasks; performance then improves during Resistance.\n\nD. The decline begins midway through Resistance, because habituation lowers arousal below $A^{\\ast}$, producing under-arousal prior to Exhaustion.",
            "solution": "This problem requires mapping the stages of Selye's General Adaptation Syndrome (GAS) onto the Yerkes–Dodson principle, which describes a non-linear, inverted-U relationship between arousal ($A$) and performance ($P$).\n\n1.  **Analyze the Stages of GAS in terms of Arousal and Performance:**\n    *   **Alarm Stage:** A rapid increase in arousal due to activation of the SAM and HPA axes. For complex tasks, this sharp spike might temporarily push arousal beyond the optimal point ($A > A^*$), causing an initial dip in performance.\n    *   **Resistance Stage:** Arousal is sustained at a high level to cope with the persistent stressor. The body adapts to maintain function. Ideally, the resident's arousal is maintained near the optimal level ($A \\approx A^*$), allowing for high performance over a prolonged period.\n    *   **Exhaustion Stage:** The body's adaptive mechanisms begin to fail. This is not simply about arousal dropping; it's about the dysregulation of the systems that manage arousal and resource depletion. The physiological cost of sustaining high arousal becomes too great.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Options based on the models:**\n    *   **A:** Incorrect. The transition from Alarm to Resistance is about establishing sustained high arousal to maintain performance, not reducing it below the optimal level. This stage represents successful adaptation, not a decline.\n    *   **B:** Correct. The Resistance stage is characterized by sustained high performance at high arousal ($A \\approx A^*$). The transition to Exhaustion signifies the point where these adaptive mechanisms fail. The continued presence of the stressor means arousal demands remain high, but the body can no longer cope effectively. This pushes the physiological state beyond the optimal point ($A > A^*$) onto the downward-sloping part of the Yerkes–Dodson curve. The failure of adaptation under high arousal is precisely what causes the sustained decline in performance.\n    *   **C:** Incorrect. While an initial performance dip might occur during the Alarm stage, the question asks for a *sustained decline* specifically because *Resistance is failing*. Performance would be expected to recover and stabilize during the Resistance stage, not begin its primary decline there.\n    *   **D:** Incorrect. \"Habituation\" implies a decrease in response to a repeated stimulus. A mass-casualty event is a demanding, high-stakes, and likely evolving stressor, making significant habituation and under-arousal improbable. The state is one of chronic over-arousal.\n\nTherefore, the sustained performance decline is most logically associated with the failure of the Resistance stage, i.e., the transition into Exhaustion, where the system is overwhelmed and pushed past its optimal operating point.",
