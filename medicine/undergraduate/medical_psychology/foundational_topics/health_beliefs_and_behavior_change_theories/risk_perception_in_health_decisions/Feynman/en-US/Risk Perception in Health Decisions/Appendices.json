Bayes' theorem provides the normative framework for this process, yet its results can often be counter-intuitive.

The questionnaire has sensitivity (true positive rate) $0.80$ and specificity (true negative rate) $0.90$. Sensitivity is defined as the probability that the test is positive given the disorder, and specificity is defined as the probability that the test is negative given no disorder.

            "introduction": "Sometimes, the way data is presented can fundamentally distort our perception of risk, leading to paradoxical conclusions. Simpson's paradox is a striking statistical phenomenon where a trend observed within individual subgroups reverses when those groups are combined. This exercise  presents a case where an intervention appears harmful in the overall population but is beneficial within every subgroup, challenging you to resolve the paradox by accounting for a confounding variable and calculating an adjusted measure of effect.",

            "problem": "A cohort study in medical psychology examines how risk perception influences health decisions and outcomes. Individuals decide whether to adopt a cognitive-behavioral stress-management intervention based on their perceived susceptibility to future anxiety-related health episodes. The outcome is the occurrence of at least one clinically significant anxiety episode over a fixed follow-up interval. Two strata are defined by baseline perceived susceptibility: high perceived susceptibility and low perceived susceptibility. Because perceived susceptibility affects both the likelihood of adopting the intervention and the baseline outcome risk, it is a potential confounder.\n\nData are as follows. In the high perceived susceptibility stratum, there are $800$ intervention participants with risk $0.35$ and $200$ non-intervention participants with risk $0.40$. In the low perceived susceptibility stratum, there are $200$ intervention participants with risk $0.08$ and $800$ non-intervention participants with risk $0.10$. Here “risk” denotes the probability of experiencing at least one anxiety episode during follow-up.\n\nUsing the core definitions of risk (probability of the outcome), risk difference (risk in the intervention group minus risk in the non-intervention group), and the law of total probability, first verify that the unadjusted (marginal) risk difference computed by ignoring strata suggests harm from the intervention while the stratum-specific risk differences in both strata indicate benefit. Then, resolve the Simpson’s paradox by computing the direct-standardized adjusted risk difference for the intervention versus non-intervention, using the combined study population as the standard population for stratification weights.\n\nExpress your final adjusted risk difference as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to first verify an instance of Simpson's paradox and then to resolve it by calculating an adjusted risk difference. I will proceed systematically.\n\nLet the two strata be denoted by $S=1$ for high perceived susceptibility (HPS) and $S=2$ for low perceived susceptibility (LPS). Let the exposure be denoted by $E=I$ for the intervention group and $E=N$ for the non-intervention group. The risk, $R$, is the probability of the outcome (anxiety episode).\n\nThe provided data can be summarized as follows:\nFor the HPS stratum ($S=1$):\nNumber in intervention group: $N_{1,I} = 800$\nRisk in intervention group: $R_{1,I} = 0.35$\nNumber in non-intervention group: $N_{1,N} = 200$\nRisk in non-intervention group: $R_{1,N} = 0.40$\n\nFor the LPS stratum ($S=2$):\nNumber in intervention group: $N_{2,I} = 200$\nRisk in intervention group: $R_{2,I} = 0.08$\nNumber in non-intervention group: $N_{2,N} = 800$\nRisk in non-intervention group: $R_{2,N} = 0.10$\n\n**Part 1: Verification of Simpson's Paradox**\n\nFirst, we calculate the unadjusted (marginal) risks by ignoring the strata. To do this, we need the total number of participants and the total number of anxiety episodes in each group (Intervention and Non-intervention) across both strata.\n\nThe number of anxiety episodes ($C$) in each subgroup is given by $C = N \\times R$:\n$C_{1,I} = N_{1,I} \\times R_{1,I} = 800 \\times 0.35 = 280$\n$C_{1,N} = N_{1,N} \\times R_{1,N} = 200 \\times 0.40 = 80$\n$C_{2,I} = N_{2,I} \\times R_{2,I} = 200 \\times 0.08 = 16$\n$C_{2,N} = N_{2,N} \\times R_{2,N} = 800 \\times 0.10 = 80$\n\nNow, we compute the total numbers for the marginal analysis:\nTotal participants in the intervention group: $N_I = N_{1,I} + N_{2,I} = 800 + 200 = 1000$\nTotal participants in the non-intervention group: $N_N = N_{1,N} + N_{2,N} = 200 + 800 = 1000$\n\nTotal episodes in the intervention group: $C_I = C_{1,I} + C_{2,I} = 280 + 16 = 296$\nTotal episodes in the non-intervention group: $C_N = C_{1,N} + C_{2,N} = 80 + 80 = 160$\n\nThe unadjusted (marginal) risks are:\nMarginal risk for the intervention group: $R_I = \\frac{C_I}{N_I} = \\frac{296}{1000} = 0.296$\nMarginal risk for the non-intervention group: $R_N = \\frac{C_N}{N_N} = \\frac{160}{1000} = 0.160$\n\nThe unadjusted risk difference ($RD_{unadj}$) is:\n$$RD_{unadj} = R_I - R_N = 0.296 - 0.160 = 0.136$$\nSince $RD_{unadj} > 0$, the crude analysis suggests that the intervention increases the risk of an anxiety episode, indicating harm.\n\nNext, we examine the stratum-specific risk differences ($RD_s = R_{s,I} - R_{s,N}$):\nFor the HPS stratum ($S=1$): $RD_1 = R_{1,I} - R_{1,N} = 0.35 - 0.40 = -0.05$\nFor the LPS stratum ($S=2$): $RD_2 = R_{2,I} - R_{2,N} = 0.08 - 0.10 = -0.02$\n\nIn both strata, the risk difference is negative, indicating a beneficial effect of the intervention (i.e., it reduces risk). The unadjusted risk difference has the opposite sign of the stratum-specific risk differences. This confirms the presence of Simpson's paradox. The paradox arises because the confounder (perceived susceptibility) is distributed unequally between the intervention and non-intervention groups. Individuals with high perceived susceptibility are both more likely to adopt the intervention and at a higher baseline risk for anxiety.\n\n**Part 2: Resolution by Direct Standardization**\n\nTo resolve the paradox, we compute an adjusted risk difference using direct standardization. This method calculates what the risks would be if the confounding variable had the same distribution in both the intervention and non-intervention groups. The problem specifies using the combined study population as the standard.\n\nFirst, we determine the structure of this standard population.\nTotal population in the HPS stratum: $N_1 = N_{1,I} + N_{1,N} = 800 + 200 = 1000$\nTotal population in the LPS stratum: $N_2 = N_{2,I} + N_{2,N} = 200 + 800 = 1000$\nTotal study population: $N_{total} = N_1 + N_2 = 1000 + 1000 = 2000$\n\nThe weights for standardization ($w_s$) are the proportions of the standard population in each stratum:\nWeight for HPS stratum: $w_1 = \\frac{N_1}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$\nWeight for LPS stratum: $w_2 = \\frac{N_2}{N_{total}} = \\frac{1000}{2000} = 0.5$\n\nNext, we compute the standardized risk for each group by taking a weighted average of the stratum-specific risks, using the weights $w_1$ and $w_2$.\nStandardized risk for the intervention group ($R_{std, I}$):\n$$R_{std, I} = w_1 R_{1,I} + w_2 R_{2,I} = (0.5 \\times 0.35) + (0.5 \\times 0.08) = 0.175 + 0.040 = 0.215$$\n\nStandardized risk for the non-intervention group ($R_{std, N}$):\n$$R_{std, N} = w_1 R_{1,N} + w_2 R_{2,N} = (0.5 \\times 0.40) + (0.5 \\times 0.10) = 0.200 + 0.050 = 0.250$$\n\nFinally, the direct-standardized adjusted risk difference ($RD_{adj}$) is the difference between these standardized risks:\n$$RD_{adj} = R_{std, I} - R_{std, N} = 0.215 - 0.250 = -0.035$$\n\nThis adjusted risk difference is negative, which aligns with the findings within each stratum and represents the estimated effect of the intervention, free from the confounding effect of perceived susceptibility. It can also be calculated as the weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences: $RD_{adj} = w_1 RD_1 + w_2 RD_2 = 0.5 \\times (-0.05) + 0.5 \\times (-0.02) = -0.025 - 0.010 = -0.035$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $-0.035$. The significant figures are $3$ and $5$. To express this to four significant figures, we add two trailing zeros. Thus, the value is $-0.03500$.",
