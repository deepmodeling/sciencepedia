            "introduction": "Understanding the relationship between how many people currently have a condition (prevalence) and how many new cases are appearing (incidence) is fundamental to epidemiology. This practice explores the classic steady-state model, which elegantly connects prevalence ($P$), incidence rate ($IR$), and the average duration of a condition ($D$). By conceptualizing the population as a system where the inflow of new cases is balanced by the outflow of recoveries, you will derive and apply the essential formula $P \\approx IR \\times D$, a cornerstone for estimating disease burden in public health .",

            "problem": "A large, closed adult cohort is followed in a stable urban setting to study the burden of dysthymia (persistent depressive disorder). The condition is assumed to be rare at any moment, there is no disease-specific mortality or differential migration, and the population size remains effectively constant over time. Episodes remit without sequelae, and new onsets occur at a constant rate over calendar time.\n\nAt the population level, suppose the observed incidence rate is $IR = 0.02$ per person-year, and the mean duration of an episode is $D = 1.5$ years. Under steady-state conditions, the expected number of individuals entering the episode state per unit time equals the expected number leaving that state per unit time.\n\nUsing only the core definitions that (i) the point prevalence proportion is the fraction of the population currently in the episode state at a time point, and (ii) the incidence rate is the flow of new episodes per unit person-time among those at risk, derive from first principles a steady-state expression for the expected point prevalence proportion as a function of $IR$ and $D$, and then compute its value for dysthymia using the values above. Express the final prevalence as a unitless decimal proportion and round your final numerical answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in fundamental epidemiological principles, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nLet $N$ represent the total size of the closed cohort, which is assumed to be constant. Let $C$ be the number of individuals currently experiencing an episode of dysthymia (prevalent cases) and $S$ be the number of individuals who are susceptible (at risk). By definition, the total population is the sum of these two groups, so $S + C = N$.\n\nThe point prevalence proportion, which we denote as $P$, is defined as the fraction of the population that has the condition at a specific time point.\n$$P = \\frac{C}{N}$$\n\nThe incidence rate, $IR$, is defined as the rate at which new cases occur within the population at risk. Over a small time interval $\\Delta t$, the number of new cases is a product of the incidence rate, the size of the susceptible population, and the duration of the interval.\n$$\\text{Number of new cases in } \\Delta t = IR \\times S \\times \\Delta t$$\nThis constitutes the inflow into the diseased state. The rate of inflow is therefore $IR \\times S$.\n\nThe problem states that the condition is \"rare at any moment\". This assumption implies that the number of prevalent cases $C$ is much smaller than the total population size $N$, i.e., $C \\ll N$. Consequently, the susceptible population $S = N - C$ can be accurately approximated by the total population $N$:\n$$S \\approx N$$\nUsing this approximation, the rate of inflow into the diseased state simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Rate of Inflow} \\approx IR \\times N$$\n\nNext, we model the outflow from the diseased state, which corresponds to remission or recovery. The problem provides the mean duration of an episode, $D$. For a process governed by a constant rate of remission, this rate, typically denoted by $\\gamma$, is the reciprocal of the mean duration.\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{1}{D}$$\nThe number of recoveries in a small time interval $\\Delta t$ is the product of the remission rate $\\gamma$ and the number of currently diseased individuals $C$. The rate of outflow is therefore:\n$$\\text{Rate of Outflow} = \\gamma \\times C = \\frac{C}{D}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the system under \"steady-state conditions\". In a steady state, the system's macroscopic properties, such as the number of cases, do not change over time. This requires the rate of inflow to equal the rate of outflow.\n$$\\text{Rate of Inflow} = \\text{Rate of Outflow}$$\nSubstituting our derived expressions for these rates:\n$$IR \\times N = \\frac{C}{D}$$\n\nOur objective is to derive an expression for the prevalence, $P = \\frac{C}{N}$. We can rearrange the steady-state equation to isolate this ratio.\n$$\\frac{C}{N} = IR \\times D$$\nThis establishes the fundamental relationship between prevalence, incidence, and duration under the specified assumptions:\n$$P = IR \\times D$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given numerical values to compute the point prevalence for dysthymia.\nThe incidence rate is $IR = 0.02$ per person-year, or $0.02 \\, \\text{year}^{-1}$.\nThe mean duration is $D = 1.5$ years.\n\n$$P = (0.02 \\, \\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (1.5 \\, \\text{years})$$\n$$P = 0.03$$\nThe result is a unitless proportion, as the time units cancel. The question asks for this value to be expressed as a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.03$ has one significant figure (the digit $3$). To express this result with a precision of four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros. The leading zeros in $0.03$ are not significant.\n$$P = 0.03000$$\nThis final value represents the expected proportion of the population that is experiencing an episode of dysthymia at any given time point, under steady-state conditions.",

            "problem": "A school district monitors first-time self-harm among adolescents aged $12$–$18$ during a single $12$-month academic year. The aim is to estimate an annual incidence proportion that reflects the risk over one year while appropriately accounting for mid-year changes in enrollment.\n\nAt the start of the year, baseline enrollment is $N_{0} = 10000$ adolescents, all initially at risk. Exactly halfway through the year, $M_{\\text{out}} = 700$ of the baseline students transfer out to other districts, and $M_{\\text{in}} = 500$ adolescents transfer in from outside districts. All other baseline students remain enrolled for the full year. Transfers occur precisely at the $6$-month mark; students who transfer out contribute only the first half of the year, and students who transfer in contribute only the second half of the year.\n\nThe district records first-time self-harm cases only while students are enrolled. During the year, the following counts of first-time cases are recorded:\n- Among the baseline students who were enrolled at the start of the year (including those who later transferred out), $C_{\\text{base}} = 180$ cases occurred while enrolled.\n- Among the students who transferred in at mid-year, $C_{\\text{in}} = 18$ cases occurred after they joined.\n\nAssume the following:\n- All $N_{0}$ and $M_{\\text{in}}$ students were initially at risk upon their respective entry times.\n- There are no other entries or exits besides $M_{\\text{out}}$ and $M_{\\text{in}}$ at mid-year.\n- There are no deaths and no losses to follow-up other than the specified transfers.\n- The underlying hazard of first-time self-harm is constant over time during the year.\n\nUsing only fundamental epidemiological definitions and principles, derive and compute the annual incidence proportion for first-time self-harm in this adolescent population that appropriately handles mid-year transfers. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction, rounded to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of an annual incidence proportion for first-time self-harm in a dynamic adolescent population. The critical features of the problem are the changes in the population size mid-year due to transfers and the assumption of a constant hazard rate.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Initial population at risk at the start of the year (time $t=0$): $N_{0} = 10000$.\n-   Number of students transferring out at mid-year (time $t=0.5$ years): $M_{\\text{out}} = 700$.\n-   Number of students transferring in at mid-year (time $t=0.5$ years): $M_{\\text{in}} = 500$.\n-   Number of first-time cases among the baseline population: $C_{\\text{base}} = 180$.\n-   Number of first-time cases among the newly transferred-in population: $C_{\\text{in}} = 18$.\n-   Total duration of observation: $T = 1$ year.\n-   Assumption: The hazard of first-time self-harm is constant over time.\n-   Assumption: All other losses to follow-up, deaths, or population changes are negligible.\n-   Requirement: The final answer must be a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using established concepts from epidemiology such as incidence proportion, dynamic cohorts, and person-time. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data to compute a robust measure of incidence that accounts for the population changes. The language is objective and the assumptions, such as constant hazard and precise mid-year transfers, are standard idealizations for such problems. The problem is internally consistent and does not violate any scientific principles. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Annual Incidence Proportion\n\nThe term \"incidence proportion\" (also known as cumulative incidence or risk) is the proportion of an initially disease-free population that develops the disease over a specified period. In a closed cohort with no losses to follow-up, it is simply the number of new cases divided by the initial population size. However, this cohort is dynamic due to students transferring in and out. In such a scenario, individuals are at risk for different lengths of time. The most appropriate method to handle this varying follow-up time is to calculate the total person-time at risk and from it, the incidence rate (also known as incidence density).\n\nThe incidence rate ($IR$) is defined as the number of new cases divided by the total person-time at risk.\n$$\nIR = \\frac{\\text{Total new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of new cases, $C_{\\text{total}}$. This is the sum of cases from the baseline group and the group that transferred in.\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{base}} + C_{\\text{in}} = 180 + 18 = 198\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total person-time at risk, $PT_{\\text{total}}$, measured in person-years. The population can be divided into three distinct groups based on their duration of enrollment:\n1.  Students enrolled for the full year: These are the baseline students who did not transfer out. Their number is $N_0 - M_{\\text{out}}$. Each contributed $1$ year of follow-up.\n    $$\n    PT_{1} = (N_{0} - M_{\\text{out}}) \\times 1 \\text{ year} = (10000 - 700) \\times 1 = 9300 \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n2.  Students who transferred out at mid-year: Their number is $M_{\\text{out}}$. They were at risk only for the first half of the year, contributing $0.5$ years each.\n    $$\n    PT_{2} = M_{\\text{out}} \\times 0.5 \\text{ years} = 700 \\times 0.5 = 350 \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n3.  Students who transferred in at mid-year: Their number is $M_{\\text{in}}$. They were at risk only for the second half of the year, contributing $0.5$ years each.\n    $$\n    PT_{3} = M_{\\text{in}} \\times 0.5 \\text{ years} = 500 \\times 0.5 = 250 \\text{ person-years}\n    $$\n\nThe total person-time at risk is the sum of the person-time from these three groups. This calculation properly accounts for the dynamic nature of the cohort.\n$$\nPT_{\\text{total}} = PT_{1} + PT_{2} + PT_{3} = 9300 + 350 + 250 = 9900 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\nA common simplification in this calculation is to not subtract the person-time for individuals after they become a case. This is a reasonable approximation when the number of cases is small relative to the population size, which is true in this problem ($198$ cases in a population of roughly $10000$).\n\nNow, we can calculate the incidence rate, which represents the constant hazard, $\\lambda$.\n$$\nIR = \\lambda = \\frac{C_{\\text{total}}}{PT_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{198}{9900} \\text{ year}^{-1} = 0.02 \\text{ year}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the *annual incidence proportion* ($IP_{\\text{annual}}$), not the incidence rate. The incidence proportion is the probability that an individual at risk at the beginning of a period will experience the event during that period. Under the assumption of a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$, the relationship between the incidence rate and the incidence proportion over a time interval $t$ is given by:\n$$\nIP(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot t)\n$$\nThis formula is derived from the survival function $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot t)$, where $IP(t) = 1 - S(t)$. For the annual incidence proportion, the time interval is $t = 1$ year.\n$$\nIP_{\\text{annual}} = 1 - \\exp(-IR \\times 1) = 1 - \\exp(-0.02)\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as required.\n$$\nIP_{\\text{annual}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.02) \\approx 1 - 0.980198673... = 0.019801326...\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.01980$. The first significant digit is $1$, followed by $9$, $8$, and $0$. The fifth significant digit is $1$, so we round down.",

The solution must be derived from fundamental principles linking these epidemiological concepts.\n\nLet $t$ represent time in years, beginning at $t=0$.\nThe instantaneous incidence rate, or hazard rate, $\\lambda(t)$, is defined as the instantaneous risk of an event (in this case, first-onset Major Depressive Episode, MDE) at time $t$, conditional on having been event-free up to time $t$.\n\nThe survival function, $S(t)$, represents the probability that an individual remains free of the event up to time $t$. By definition, for a cohort entirely free of the condition at baseline, $S(0) = 1$.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the hazard rate $\\lambda(t)$ and the survival function $S(t)$ is given by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)} \\frac{dS(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{dS(t)}{S(t)} = -\\lambda(t) dt\n$$\nTo find the survival function $S(t)$, we integrate both sides of this equation. We integrate the left side from $S(0)$ to $S(t)$ and the right side from time $0$ to time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{S(0)}^{S(t)} \\frac{1}{S'} dS' = -\\int_0^t \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThe left-hand side evaluates to $\\ln(S(t)) - \\ln(S(0))$.

Thus, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\ln(S(t)) = -\\int_0^t \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the general form of the survival function in terms of the hazard rate:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau\\right)\n$$\nIn this problem, the hazard rate is stated to be constant over the follow-up period: $\\lambda(t) = \\lambda = 0.05$ per person-year.\nSubstituting this constant $\\lambda$ into the integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\lambda d\\tau = \\lambda \\int_0^t d\\tau = \\lambda t\n$$\nTherefore, the survival function for this specific case simplifies to:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThe cumulative incidence, $CI(T)$, is the probability that an individual experiences the event by a certain time $T$. It is the complement of the survival function:\n$$\nCI(T) = 1 - S(T)\n$$\nWe need to find the cumulative incidence over a period of $T=1$ year.
