Statistical models, such as linear regression, provide a powerful framework for predicting how changes in structural factors might impact health outcomes. This exercise  guides you through a fundamental application: using a pre-existing model's coefficients to forecast the expected change in mental health symptoms resulting from a hypothetical policy intervention. Mastering this skill is key to translating research findings into actionable, evidence-based policy recommendations.",

            "problem": "In a community mental health cohort, depressive symptom severity is quantified as a continuous score $Y$ (in points) and modeled as a linear function of key structural and social determinants of health. Investigators posit the linear model\n$$Y=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\, Income+\\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability+\\beta_{3} \\, Stress+\\epsilon,$$\nwhere $Y$ is the depressive symptom score, $Income$ is an index of household income, $HousingInstability$ is a standardized measure of residential instability, $Stress$ is a composite psychosocial stress score, $\\epsilon$ is an unobserved disturbance, and $\\beta_{0},\\beta_{1},\\beta_{2},\\beta_{3}$ are unknown parameters.

Extraction of Givens:**\n-   The linear model for depressive symptom severity, $Y$, is given by: $Y=\\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1} \\, Income+\\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability+\\beta_{3} \\, Stress+\\epsilon$.\n-   $Y$ is the depressive symptom score in points.\n-   The independent variables are $Income$, $HousingInstability$, and $Stress$.\n-   $\\epsilon$ is an unobserved disturbance term.\n-   $\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3}$ are the model parameters.\n-   The values for a subset of the parameters are provided: $(\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, \\beta_{3}) = (-0.3, 1.1, 0.5)$.\n-   A policy intervention causes the following changes in the independent variables (covariates):\n    -   Change in $Income$: $\\Delta Income = +5$ units.\n    -   Change in $HousingInstability$: $\\Delta HousingInstability = -0.4$ units.\n    -   Change in $Stress$: $\\Delta Stress = 0$ units.\n-   A key assumption of the linear model is provided: the conditional expectation of the disturbance term is zero, $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon \\mid Income, HousingInstability, Stress]=0$. This is assumed to hold for any set of covariate values.\n-   The objective is to compute the expected change in the depressive symptom score, denoted as $\\Delta Y$, for the target group.\n\n**2. Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is **valid**.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses a linear regression model, a fundamental and widely accepted tool in statistics, biostatistics, and epidemiology for modeling relationships between variables. The context (determinants of mental health) is realistic and appropriate for the specified field of medical psychology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary information is provided. The model, parameter values, and changes in covariates are explicitly stated. The objective—to find the expected change in the outcome—is clearly defined and has a unique solution based on the provided data and assumptions.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is formulated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased mathematical language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a standard application of the principles of linear models and conditional expectation.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds from the first principles of conditional expectation as applied to the given linear model. Let the state of the covariates before the intervention be denoted by the subscript $1$ and the state after the intervention by the subscript $2$.\n\nThe depressive symptom score before the intervention, $Y_1$, is given by:\n$$Y_1 = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_1 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_1 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_1 + \\epsilon_1$$\nThe score after the intervention, $Y_2$, is:\n$$Y_2 = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_2 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_2 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_2 + \\epsilon_2$$\nThe problem requires computing the expected change in $Y$. This quantity is the difference between the expected value of $Y$ after the intervention and the expected value of $Y$ before the intervention.\n\nThe expected value of the depressive symptom score, conditional on the values of the covariates, is derived using the linearity of the expectation operator. For any set of covariates, say $(I, H, S)$ for $(Income, HousingInstability, Stress)$, the conditional expectation of $Y$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid I, H, S] = \\mathbb{E}[\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}I + \\beta_{2}H + \\beta_{3}S + \\epsilon \\mid I, H, S]$$\nSince $\\beta_{i}$ and the covariates are constants with respect to the expectation conditional on them, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid I, H, S] = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}I + \\beta_{2}H + \\beta_{3}S + \\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon \\mid I, H, S]$$\nThe problem states the standard linear model assumption that $\\mathbb{E}[\\epsilon \\mid \\text{covariates}] = 0$. Therefore, the conditional expectation of $Y$ is the deterministic part of the model:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid I, H, S] = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}I + \\beta_{2}H + \\beta_{3}S$$\n\nLet $\\mathbb{E}[Y_1]$ be the expected score before the intervention, conditional on the initial covariates $(Income_1, HousingInstability_1, Stress_1)$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_1] = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_1 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_1 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_1$$\nLet $\\mathbb{E}[Y_2]$ be the expected score after the intervention, conditional on the final covariates $(Income_2, HousingInstability_2, Stress_2)$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[Y_2] = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_2 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_2 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_2$$\n\nThe expected change, which we denote as $\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y]$, is the difference $\\mathbb{E}[Y_2] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_1]$.\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_2 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_2 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_2) - (\\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} \\, Income_1 + \\beta_{2} \\, HousingInstability_1 + \\beta_{3} \\, Stress_1)$$\nRearranging the terms by coefficient:\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = (\\beta_{0} - \\beta_{0}) + \\beta_{1}(Income_2 - Income_1) + \\beta_{2}(HousingInstability_2 - HousingInstability_1) + \\beta_{3}(Stress_2 - Stress_1)$$\nThe constant term $\\beta_0$ cancels out. The differences in the covariates are the specified changes, denoted by $\\Delta$:\n-   $Income_2 - Income_1 = \\Delta Income = 5$\n-   $HousingInstability_2 - HousingInstability_1 = \\Delta HousingInstability = -0.4$\n-   $Stress_2 - Stress_1 = \\Delta Stress = 0$\n\nSubstituting these changes into the expression for $\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y]$ yields:\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = \\beta_{1} (\\Delta Income) + \\beta_{2} (\\Delta HousingInstability) + \\beta_{3} (\\Delta Stress)$$\nThis expression demonstrates a core feature of linear models: the expected change in the outcome is a linear combination of the changes in the predictors, with the model coefficients serving as the weights. The initial values of the covariates are not needed to compute the change.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the coefficients and the changes:\n$\\beta_{1} = -0.3$\n$\\beta_{2} = 1.1$\n$\\beta_{3} = 0.5$\n$\\Delta Income = 5$\n$\\Delta HousingInstability = -0.4$\n$\\Delta Stress = 0$\n\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = (-0.3)(5) + (1.1)(-0.4) + (0.5)(0)$$\nPerforming the multiplication for each term:\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = -1.5 - 0.44 + 0$$\nSumming the terms gives the final result:\n$$\\Delta \\mathbb{E}[Y] = -1.94$$\nThus, the expected change in the depressive symptom score is a decrease of $1.94$ points.",

In a two-period, two-group difference-in-differences (DID) framework, we consider outcomes for group $g \\in \\{\\text{treated}, \\text{control}\\}$ observed at times $t \\in \\{\\text{pre}, \\text{post}\\}$. Under the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) and the parallel trends assumption, we can start from a standard additive model with an interaction term:\n$$\nY_{g t} = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{g=\\text{treated}\\} + \\gamma \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{t=\\text{post}\\} + \\delta \\cdot \\Big(\\mathbf{1}\\{g=\\text{treated}\\}\\cdot \\mathbf{1}\\{t=\\text{post}\\}\\Big) + \\varepsilon_{g t},\n$$\nwhere $Y_{g t}$ denotes the mean PHQ-9 score for group $g$ at time $t$, $\\alpha$ is a baseline level, $\\beta$ is a time-invariant group difference, $\\gamma$ is a time shock common to both groups, $\\delta$ is the causal effect of the intervention on the treated group in the post period, and $\\varepsilon_{g t}$ is an error term with mean zero.\n\nThe quantity of interest is $\\delta$. By construction of the model, the change over time in the treated group includes both the common time effect and the treatment effect, whereas the change over time in the control group includes only the common time effect. Therefore, taking the difference of the treated group’s change and the control group’s change differences out the common time shock $\\gamma$, isolating $\\delta$. Formally, define the within-group changes:\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{treated}} = Y_{\\text{treated, post}} - Y_{\\text{treated, pre}}, \\quad \\Delta_{\\text{control}} = Y_{\\text{control, post}} - Y_{\\text{control, pre}}.\n$$\nUnder the model above,\n$$\n\\Delta_{\\text{treated}} = \\gamma + \\delta, \\quad \\Delta_{\\text{control}} = \\gamma,\n$$\nso the DID estimator is\n$$\n\\widehat{\\delta} = \\Delta_{\\text{treated}} - \\Delta_{\\text{control}}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute these changes using the provided means.

Since lower PHQ-9 scores reflect improved depressive symptom severity, $\\widehat{\\delta} = -1.2$ points suggests that the structural housing intervention is associated with an improvement in depressive symptoms beyond the general time trend observed in the control city.

Suppose the data are modeled by the following linear structural equations with additive, mean-zero error terms that are uncorrelated with $X$:\n$$\nM = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} X + \\epsilon_{M},\n$$\n$$\nY = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2} M + \\epsilon_{Y}.\n$$\nAssume there is no interaction between $X$ and $M$ in the outcome model.

            "solution": "The problem presents a linear structural equation model for causal mediation analysis, with income ($X$) as the independent variable, depressive symptom severity ($Y$) as the dependent variable, and chronic perceived stress ($M$) as the mediator. The model is specified by two equations:\n$$\nM = \\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} X + \\epsilon_{M}\n$$\n$$\nY = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2} M + \\epsilon_{Y}\n$$\nThe terms $\\epsilon_{M}$ and $\\epsilon_{Y}$ are mean-zero error terms uncorrelated with $X$. The problem requires deriving the decomposition of the total effect of $X$ on $Y$ into direct and indirect pathways, and then computing the magnitude of the indirect pathway and its proportion of the total effect for given parameter values.\n\nFirst, we derive the expressions for the total, direct, and indirect effects. The total effect ($TE$) of $X$ on $Y$ is the overall change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in $X$. To find this, we substitute the first equation into the second to express $Y$ solely in terms of $X$ and the error terms:\n$$\nY = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2} (\\alpha_{0} + \\alpha_{1} X + \\epsilon_{M}) + \\epsilon_{Y}\n$$\nDistributing the $\\beta_{2}$ term, we get:\n$$\nY = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X + \\beta_{2}\\alpha_{0} + \\beta_{2}\\alpha_{1} X + \\beta_{2}\\epsilon_{M} + \\epsilon_{Y}\n$$\nWe can collect terms involving $X$ and constant terms:\n$$\nY = (\\beta_{0} + \\alpha_{0}\\beta_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2})X + (\\beta_{2}\\epsilon_{M} + \\epsilon_{Y})\n$$\nThis is the reduced-form equation for $Y$. The total effect of $X$ on $Y$ is the coefficient of $X$ in this equation, which represents $\\frac{d(E[Y|X])}{dX}$. Given that the error terms have an expected value of zero, the expected value of $Y$ conditional on $X$ is $E[Y|X=x] = (\\beta_{0} + \\alpha_{0}\\beta_{2}) + (\\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2})x$. The total effect is therefore:\n$$\nTE = \\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}\n$$\nThe total effect can be decomposed into a direct effect ($DE$) and an indirect effect ($IE$).\n\nThe direct effect ($DE$) is the effect of $X$ on $Y$ while holding the mediator $M$ constant. In the given linear model, this is directly represented by the coefficient of $X$ in the equation for $Y$:\n$$\nDE = \\beta_{1}\n$$\nThe indirect effect ($IE$) is the effect of $X$ on $Y$ that is transmitted through the mediator $M$. It is calculated as the product of the effect of $X$ on $M$ (path $X \\to M$) and the effect of $M$ on $Y$ (path $M \\to Y$). The coefficient $\\alpha_1$ represents the change in $M$ for a one-unit change in $X$. The coefficient $\\beta_2$ represents the change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in $M$, holding $X$ constant. Thus, the indirect effect is:\n$$\nIE = \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}\n$$\nThe decomposition of the total effect is the sum of the direct and indirect effects:\n$$\nTE = DE + IE = \\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}\n$$\nThis confirms the expression for the total effect derived earlier.\n\nNext, we compute the required quantities using the provided parameter values: $\\alpha_{1} = 0.6$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.5$, and $\\beta_{1} = 0.2$.\n\n1.  The magnitude of the indirect pathway from $X$ to $Y$ through $M$ is:\n$$\nIE = \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2} = (0.6)(0.5) = 0.3\n$$\nThis means that for every one-unit increase in the income $z$-score ($X$), the stress $z$-score ($M$) is expected to increase by $0.6$ units, which in turn leads to an increase in the depression $z$-score ($Y$) of $0.6 \\times 0.5 = 0.3$ units.\n\n2.  To find the proportion of the total effect transmitted through $M$, we first compute the total effect ($TE$):\n$$\nTE = \\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2} = 0.2 + 0.3 = 0.5\n$$\nThe total effect of a one-unit increase in $X$ on $Y$ is an increase of $0.5$ units. The proportion of this total effect that is accounted for by the indirect pathway through $M$ is the ratio of the indirect effect to the total effect:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion} = \\frac{IE}{TE} = \\frac{\\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}}{\\beta_{1} + \\alpha_{1}\\beta_{2}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.5} = 0.6\n$$\nThus, $60\\%$ of the total effect of income on depressive symptoms is mediated by chronic perceived stress in this model.\n\nThe two values requested are the magnitude of the indirect pathway ($0.3$) and the proportion of the total effect transmitted through the mediator ($0.6$).",
