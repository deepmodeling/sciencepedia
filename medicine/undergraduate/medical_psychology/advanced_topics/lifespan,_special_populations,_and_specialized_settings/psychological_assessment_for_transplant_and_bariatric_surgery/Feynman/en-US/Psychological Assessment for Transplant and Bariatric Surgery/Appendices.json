This practice introduces a scoring model based on the principles of a real-world instrument, the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT).

            "problem": "A hospital transplant psychology team uses the Stanford Integrated Psychosocial Assessment for Transplantation (SIPAT) to quantify preoperative psychosocial risk for a kidney transplant candidate. A composite psychosocial risk score $S$ is constructed from four domains whose contributions are additive, reflecting the measurement principle that independent risk components combine linearly. Each domain is measured by items rated on an anchored scale, and each domain is assigned an empirically derived weight that reflects its relative influence on clinical outcomes such as adherence, relapse, and post-transplant adjustment. The domains and weights are as follows:\n\n- Patient’s Readiness (PR): $w_{\\mathrm{PR}} = 1$.\n- Social Support (SS): $w_{\\mathrm{SS}} = 1$.\n- Psychological Stability and Psychopathology (PSY): $w_{\\mathrm{PSY}} = 2$.\n- Lifestyle, Substance Use, and Adherence (LS): $w_{\\mathrm{LS}} = 2$.\n\nWithin each domain, items are scored on an anchored ordinal scale with integer values from $0$ to $3$, where higher values reflect greater psychosocial risk load for that item. The composite score follows the additive model $S = w_{\\mathrm{PR}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PR}} + w_{\\mathrm{SS}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{SS}} + w_{\\mathrm{PSY}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PSY}} + w_{\\mathrm{LS}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{LS}}$, where $R_{\\mathrm{Domain}}$ is the sum of item ratings within that domain.\n\nRisk categories used by the team are:\n- Low psychosocial risk if $S \\leq 30$.\n- Moderate psychosocial risk if $31 \\leq S \\leq 60$.\n- High psychosocial risk if $S \\geq 61$.\n\nFor this candidate, the item ratings assigned by the evaluator are:\n\nPatient’s Readiness (PR; $5$ items): understanding of procedure $= 3$, health literacy $= 2$, treatment adherence history $= 3$, motivation for transplant $= 1$, decisional capacity $= 2$.\n\nSocial Support (SS; $4$ items): presence of reliable caregiver $= 3$, stability of caregiving plan $= 2$, financial/transportation resources $= 2$, community support engagement $= 1$.\n\nPsychological Stability and Psychopathology (PSY; $5$ items): current mood symptoms $= 1$, anxiety symptoms $= 2$, history of severe mental illness $= 1$, trauma-related symptoms $= 2$, psychiatric treatment engagement $= 1$.\n\nLifestyle, Substance Use, and Adherence (LS; $6$ items): nicotine use $= 2$, alcohol use $= 3$, other substances $= 2$, dietary adherence $= 3$, appointment attendance $= 1$, medication management $= 2$.\n\nCompute the SIPAT composite score $S$ for this candidate using the specified weighting model, and determine the corresponding risk category based on the thresholds above. Report the numerical value of $S$. No rounding is required; provide the exact integer value.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of psychometric assessment, specifically the use of a weighted linear model to form a composite score from sub-domain ratings, which is a standard methodology in medical psychology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the scoring model, domain weights, individual item ratings, and risk classification thresholds—to arrive at a single, unambiguous answer. The language is objective and the data are internally consistent.\n\nThe task is to compute the composite psychosocial risk score, $S$, and determine the corresponding risk category for a kidney transplant candidate. The score is calculated using the specified additive model:\n$$S = w_{\\mathrm{PR}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PR}} + w_{\\mathrm{SS}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{SS}} + w_{\\mathrm{PSY}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PSY}} + w_{\\mathrm{LS}} \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{LS}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{Domain}}$ represents the sum of item ratings within a domain and $w_{\\mathrm{Domain}}$ is the corresponding weight.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the sum of the item ratings for each of the four domains based on the data provided for the candidate.\n\nFor the Patient’s Readiness (PR) domain, which has $5$ items, the ratings are $3$, $2$, $3$, $1$, and $2$. The sum is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{PR}} = 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11$$\n\nFor the Social Support (SS) domain, which has $4$ items, the ratings are $3$, $2$, $2$, and $1$. The sum is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{SS}} = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8$$\n\nFor the Psychological Stability and Psychopathology (PSY) domain, which has $5$ items, the ratings are $1$, $2$, $1$, $2$, and $1$. The sum is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{PSY}} = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7$$\n\nFor the Lifestyle, Substance Use, and Adherence (LS) domain, which has $6$ items, the ratings are $2$, $3$, $2$, $3$, $1$, and $2$. The sum is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{LS}} = 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 13$$\n\nNext, we substitute these domain scores into the composite score formula using the specified weights: $w_{\\mathrm{PR}} = 1$, $w_{\\mathrm{SS}} = 1$, $w_{\\mathrm{PSY}} = 2$, and $w_{\\mathrm{LS}} = 2$.\n$$S = (1 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PR}}) + (1 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{SS}}) + (2 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{PSY}}) + (2 \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{LS}})$$\n$$S = (1 \\cdot 11) + (1 \\cdot 8) + (2 \\cdot 7) + (2 \\cdot 13)$$\n$$S = 11 + 8 + 14 + 26$$\nPerforming the addition:\n$$S = 19 + 14 + 26$$\n$$S = 33 + 26$$\n$$S = 59$$\nThe calculated SIPAT composite score is $S=59$.\n\nFinally, we determine the risk category by comparing this score to the given thresholds:\n- Low psychosocial risk: $S \\leq 30$\n- Moderate psychosocial risk: $31 \\leq S \\leq 60$\n- High psychosocial risk: $S \\geq 61$\n\nSince the computed score is $S=59$, it falls within the range $31 \\leq 59 \\leq 60$. Therefore, the candidate is classified as having a Moderate psychosocial risk. The problem asks for the numerical value of $S$.",

            "problem": "A candidate for kidney transplant is undergoing pre-transplant psychological assessment. The patient is a $52$-year-old male with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage $4$ due to diabetic nephropathy, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of $22 \\text{ mL/min/1.73 m}^2$. Over the last $3$ months, he reports progressive fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, and low mood. He describes sleep fragmentation with approximately $5$ hours of sleep per night, loud snoring, and his partner has witnessed pauses in breathing. He denies suicidal ideation, psychomotor retardation, or pervasive anhedonia; he continues to enjoy watching soccer but feels “discouraged about dialysis and the future.” Appetite is unchanged and weight is stable. He notes that symptoms are worse on post-dialysis days. Past psychiatric history is negative. Current medications include an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, insulin, and gabapentin. Alcohol use is minimal and he denies opioid use. Vital signs include blood pressure $140/85$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. Laboratory results show hemoglobin $9.6 \\text{ g/dL}$, ferritin $160 \\text{ ng/mL}$, transferrin saturation $22\\%$, thyroid-stimulating hormone $2.1 \\text{ \\textmu IU/mL}$. Patient Health Questionnaire ($\\mathrm{PHQ}\\text{-}9$) score is $10$ with endorsement of low mood, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and concentration difficulties, but no suicidal ideation. The Snoring, Tiredness, Observed apnea, high blood Pressure, Body mass index, Age, Neck circumference, Gender (STOP-Bang) screening yields: snoring (yes), daytime tiredness (yes), observed apneas (yes), high blood pressure (yes), body mass index $37 \\text{ kg/m}^2$ (yes), age $> 50$ (yes), neck circumference $42 \\text{ cm}$ (yes), male gender (yes), for a total score of $8$.\n\nYou are asked to determine the most appropriate differential diagnosis and treatment plan before granting psychological clearance. Use the following fundamental bases from medical psychology and behavioral medicine:\n\n- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-$5$) criteria for a Major Depressive Episode: a syndrome defined by at least $5$ symptoms including depressed mood or anhedonia for at least $2$ weeks, causing clinically significant distress or impairment, and not better explained by a substance or another medical condition.\n- The principle of ruling out medical etiologies that can produce overlapping symptom clusters (for example, anemia, sleep-disordered breathing, hypothyroidism), and addressing modifiable contributors before labeling a primary psychiatric disorder.\n- Validated screening tools: Patient Health Questionnaire ($\\mathrm{PHQ}\\text{-}9$) severity thresholds (scores $5$–$9$ mild, $10$–$14$ moderate, $15$–$19$ moderately severe, $\\geq$ $20$ severe), and STOP-Bang score $\\geq$ $3$ indicating high risk for Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).\n- Pre-transplant psychological clearance principles: identify and mitigate modifiable risks to adherence and postoperative recovery, ensure stability of mood and sleep sufficient for reliable participation in complex care, and avoid introducing perioperative risks (for example, excessive sedation from benzodiazepines).\n\nWhich option best integrates the differential diagnosis and specifies an appropriate pre-transplant management plan?\n\nA. Diagnose Major Depressive Disorder; initiate sertraline at a renally adjusted dose immediately; grant psychological clearance now because pharmacotherapy will address depressive symptoms, and no further sleep or medical evaluation is necessary.\n\nB. Diagnose Adjustment Disorder with depressed mood with probable comorbid Obstructive Sleep Apnea and anemia contributing to fatigue and sleep disturbance; order overnight polysomnography and initiate Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) if indicated, coordinate with nephrology to optimize erythropoiesis-stimulating agent and iron management, provide brief cognitive-behavioral therapy focused on coping and sleep hygiene, and re-evaluate mood and sleep after $4$–$6$ weeks prior to granting clearance.\n\nC. Diagnose demoralization only; provide reassurance without additional workup; grant psychological clearance today because low mood is expected in CKD and does not require intervention.\n\nD. Diagnose Depressive Disorder due to another medical condition with high suicide risk; defer transplant listing; start a benzodiazepine for sleep and refer for inpatient psychiatric admission.\n\nE. Diagnose Substance-Induced Depressive Disorder secondary to opioid use; taper opioids and grant immediate clearance after $1$ week given the reversible etiology.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It presents a scientifically sound and clinically realistic vignette that requires the application of differential diagnosis principles in a complex medical patient. All necessary data (patient history, lab results, screening scores) and guiding principles are provided to arrive at a logical conclusion.\n\nThe core of the problem is to distinguish between a primary psychiatric disorder and symptoms secondary to underlying medical conditions.\n1.  **Analyze the Data**: The patient presents with symptoms that overlap between depression, anemia, and sleep apnea (fatigue, low mood, concentration issues). The $\\mathrm{PHQ}\\text{-}9$ score of $10$ indicates moderate depressive symptoms, but key features of Major Depressive Disorder (e.g., pervasive anhedonia) are absent.\n2.  **Identify Medical Causes**: There is overwhelming evidence for severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) from the maximum STOP-Bang score of $8$ and classic symptoms (snoring, witnessed apneas). There is also diagnosed anemia (hemoglobin $9.6 \\text{ g/dL}$). Both OSA and anemia are potent causes of the patient's entire symptom cluster. The provided principle to \"rule out medical etiologies\" is paramount.\n3.  **Evaluate the Options**:\n    *   **A** is incorrect because it prematurely diagnoses Major Depressive Disorder and proposes an unsafe plan that ignores the likely primary medical causes (OSA, anemia).\n    *   **B** is the correct choice. It accurately frames the diagnosis as an Adjustment Disorder with contributing medical factors. The management plan is comprehensive and safe: confirm and treat the probable OSA, coordinate anemia management, provide psychological support, and critically, re-evaluate before granting clearance.\n    *   **C** is incorrect as it is negligent, ignoring the life-threatening risks of untreated severe OSA and anemia.\n    *   **D** is incorrect because it misidentifies suicide risk (which is explicitly denied) and proposes harmful treatment (benzodiazepines worsen OSA).\n    *   **E** is incorrect as it is based on a false premise (the patient denies opioid use).\n\nTherefore, option B provides the most appropriate and safest integration of diagnosis and management, adhering to all clinical principles.",

            "problem": "A $42$-year-old individual with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is being evaluated for kidney transplant listing. Psychological assessment finds a current Major Depressive Episode of moderate severity, with a Patient Health Questionnaire-$9$ (PHQ-$9$) score of $14$, no psychotic features, no suicidal ideation, and intact decisional capacity demonstrated by the ability to understand, appreciate, reason about, and express a choice regarding the risks and benefits of transplantation and immunosuppression. The individual has attended dialysis on schedule for $98\\%$ of sessions over the past $12$ months, has a medication refill record consistent with $95\\%$ on-time refills, and has a highly engaged caregiver network; the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) percentile is estimated at the $85^{\\text{th}}$ percentile based on clinic norms. They have been adherent to treatment for depression (started Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) therapy $8$ weeks ago and weekly psychotherapy) with partial improvement. Substance use screening is negative. There are no active safety concerns.\n\nUsing fundamental bioethical principles—respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice—together with well-established transplant psychosocial assessment facts (moderate depression is not an absolute contraindication; social support and adherence history are robust predictors of posttransplant adherence), decide the most ethically defensible listing approach that balances autonomy with outcome optimization. Select the option that best specifies both the decision and clear criteria to operationalize it.\n\nA. Proceed with listing now under conditional psychosocial criteria that aim to preserve autonomy and optimize outcomes. Criteria include: documented intact decisional capacity; continued engagement in evidence-based depression treatment with scheduled monitoring; a written safety plan; a designated primary caregiver with backup; a structured postoperative adherence plan; and predefined triggers for temporary hold such as emergence of suicidality, $\\text{PHQ-}9$ increase to $>20$, or repeated missed visits.\n\nB. Defer listing until full remission of depression is demonstrated for $\\ge 6$ consecutive months, with $\\text{PHQ-}9$ maintained at $5$, and only then list without conditions.\n\nC. Proceed with listing now without any psychosocial conditions, because autonomy requires that mood symptoms not constrain access when capacity is intact.\n\nD.

This means proceeding with the life-saving surgery while actively managing the risk of depression. Simply denying or indefinitely delaying listing would cause harm (violating nonmaleficence).\n    *   **Justice**: Given the patient's strong positive predictors for adherence, they represent a responsible steward of a scarce organ.
