            "problem": "A cohort study in medical psychology examines the relationship between dispositional optimism and medication adherence among adults with chronic illness. Investigators report a baseline adherence probability of $p=0.60$ for patients with low optimism, and a multiplicative effect of high optimism on adherence summarized by an odds ratio (OR) of $1.5$. Assume a standard epidemiological framework in which the odds of an event are defined as $p/(1-p)$ and odds ratios act multiplicatively on odds across groups with differing exposure (here, optimism level). Under these assumptions, derive from first principles the high-optimism adherence probability from the baseline $p$, and then compute the absolute adherence difference between the high- and low-optimism groups.\n\nExpress the final adherence difference as a decimal.

            "introduction": "Beyond calculation, a core scientific skill is the critical appraisal of evidence. This conceptual exercise challenges you to analyze a common research scenario for a subtle but powerful form of bias known as collider bias.

            "problem": "A hospital-based cohort study in medical psychology seeks to estimate how dispositional optimism affects mortality in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Let $O$ denote baseline dispositional optimism, $S$ denote acute illness severity at presentation, $H$ denote hospitalization status, and $M$ denote ICU mortality. Investigators enroll only hospitalized patients (so the dataset sets $H=1$) and fit a regression of $M$ on $O$ among these hospitalized individuals.\n\nRely on the following well-tested facts and core definitions from causal inference:\n\n- A directed acyclic graph describes causal relations via arrows between variables, and a collider is a variable that has arrows pointing into it from two other variables.\n- Conditioning on (or selecting into) a collider can induce a statistical association between its causes even when those causes are otherwise independent; this is a form of selection bias often referred to as Berkson’s paradox.\n- In acute illness, higher severity $S$ increases both hospitalization $H$ and the risk of ICU mortality $M$. In medical psychology, higher optimism $O$ can change care-seeking and clinician admission decisions, thereby changing hospitalization $H$ even when $O$ has no direct biological effect on $M$.\n\nAssume that $S \\to H$, $S \\to M$, and $O \\to H$ are present, and you are estimating the effect of $O$ on $M$ using only $H=1$ patients. You do not condition on any other variable. Which option best explains the bias induced by conditioning on hospitalization in this design and correctly identifies the collider in the implied directed acyclic graph?\n\nA. Conditioning on $H$ opens the non-causal path $O \\to H \\leftarrow S \\to M$, inducing an association between $O$ and $M$ even if $O$ has no causal effect on $M$; the collider is $H$.\n\nB. Conditioning on $H$ blocks confounding because $H$ is a mediator from $O$ to $M$, so the association in the hospitalized sample is unbiased; the collider is $S$.\n\nC. Conditioning on $H$ opens $O \\leftarrow S \\to M$, but because $H$ is upstream of $M$, there is no bias; the collider is $M$.\n\nD. Conditioning on $H$ removes all backdoor paths since $H$ is a common cause of $O$ and $M$, so selection reduces bias; the collider is $O$.",
            "solution": "To solve this, we first construct the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based on the given causal relationships: $O \\to H$ (Optimism affects hospitalization), $S \\to H$ (Severity affects hospitalization), and $S \\to M$ (Severity affects mortality). The resulting graph is $O \\rightarrow H \\leftarrow S \\rightarrow M$. We are analyzing the relationship between optimism ($O$) and mortality ($M$).\n\nThe path connecting $O$ and $M$ in this structure is $O \\to H \\leftarrow S \\to M$. On this path, hospitalization ($H$) is a **collider**, because two arrows point into it (from $O$ and $S$).\n\nAccording to the rules of causal inference, a path containing a collider is naturally blocked. However, when an analysis conditions on the collider (in this case, by selecting only hospitalized patients, which is equivalent to conditioning on $H=1$), the path becomes unblocked or \"opened\".\n\nOpening this non-causal path induces a statistical association between $O$ and $S$ within the selected sample. Because $S$ is a direct cause of $M$, this induced association between $O$ and $S$ creates a spurious, non-causal association between $O$ and $M$. This phenomenon is a form of selection bias known as collider bias or Berkson's paradox. It means that the estimated association between $O$ and $M$ in the hospitalized sample is biased, regardless of the true causal effect.\n\nBased on this analysis, we evaluate the options:\n\n*   **A. Conditioning on $H$ opens the non-causal path $O \\to H \\leftarrow S \\to M$, inducing an association between $O$ and $M$ even if $O$ has no causal effect on $M$; the collider is $H$.** This statement correctly identifies the path, the collider ($H$), and the consequence of conditioning on it (opening a non-causal path that induces bias). This is the correct explanation.\n*   **B.** This is incorrect. $H$ is a collider, not a mediator, and conditioning on it induces, rather than blocks, bias. $S$ is a common cause (a fork), not a collider.\n*   **C.** This uses an incorrect path and makes a false claim about bias. $M$ is the outcome and is not a collider in this graph.\n*   **D.** This misidentifies $H$ as a common cause and incorrectly claims that selection reduces bias. Conditioning on a collider induces bias. $O$ is an exposure, not a collider.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct analysis.",
