            "introduction": "A core skill in medical psychology is the ability to translate subjective patient reports into objective, quantifiable data. This is especially vital for tracking symptoms like insomnia, which are common across many neurological disorders. This practice will guide you through calculating a key metric in sleep medicine—sleep efficiency—to formally assess the severity of sleep disturbance in a hypothetical case of Parkinson's disease . Mastering this calculation provides a concrete foundation for evidence-based symptom monitoring.",

            "problem": "A patient with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease presents with fragmented sleep and daytime fatigue. In medical psychology and behavioral sleep medicine, sleep continuity metrics are used to quantify insomnia severity and inform treatment planning, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). By standard sleep medicine definitions, Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) is the time from lying down to the first epoch of sleep, Wake After Sleep Onset (WASO) is the cumulative time awake after initially falling asleep until getting out of bed, Total Sleep Time (TST) is the total minutes asleep while in bed, and Sleep Efficiency (SE) is the ratio of TST to time in bed (TIB). On the night of assessment, actigraphy and sleep diary agree on the following values: time in bed was $480$ minutes, Sleep Onset Latency (SOL) was $40$ minutes, and there were three awakenings after sleep onset lasting $15$ minutes, $10$ minutes, and $25$ minutes, respectively.\n\nUsing only these core definitions, compute the patient’s sleep efficiency and, based on the clinical convention that values below $0.85$ indicate clinically significant insomnia, determine whether the patient meets this threshold. Express the final sleep efficiency as a unitless decimal and round your result to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The task requires applying foundational definitions of sleep continuity:\n\n1. Define quantities symbolically. Let $TIB$ denote time in bed, $SOL$ denote Sleep Onset Latency, $WASO$ denote Wake After Sleep Onset, $TST$ denote Total Sleep Time, and $SE$ denote Sleep Efficiency. By definition,\n$$\nSE \\;=\\; \\frac{TST}{TIB}.\n$$\n\n2. Construct $TST$ from the base definitions. The patient is in bed for $TIB = 480$ minutes. During that interval, the patient is awake for $SOL$ minutes before the first sleep epoch and then awake again for $WASO$ minutes due to intra-sleep awakenings. Therefore, the minutes actually spent sleeping are the remainder of the in-bed interval after subtracting all wakefulness:\n$$\nTST \\;=\\; TIB \\;-\\; SOL \\;-\\; WASO.\n$$\n\n3. Compute $WASO$ from the awakening durations. The recorded awakenings after sleep onset lasted $15$ minutes, $10$ minutes, and $25$ minutes. Thus,\n$$\nWASO \\;=\\; 15 + 10 + 25 \\;=\\; 50 \\text{ minutes}.\n$$\n\n4. Substitute known values to find $TST$:\n$$\nTST \\;=\\; 480 - 40 - 50 \\;=\\; 390 \\text{ minutes}.\n$$\n\n5. Compute sleep efficiency:\n$$\nSE \\;=\\; \\frac{TST}{TIB} \\;=\\; \\frac{390}{480}.\n$$\nThis fraction simplifies as\n$$\n\\frac{390}{480} \\;=\\; \\frac{39}{48} \\;=\\; \\frac{13}{16} \\;=\\; 0.8125.\n$$\n\n6. Rounding to the requested precision of four significant figures does not change the value, since $0.8125$ already has four significant figures:\n$$\nSE \\;=\\; 0.8125 \\text{ (unitless decimal, four significant figures)}.\n$$\n\n7. Clinical interpretation using the given threshold. The instruction states that values below $0.85$ indicate clinically significant insomnia. Since $0.8125 < 0.85$, the patient’s sleep efficiency meets the threshold consistent with clinically significant insomnia, which is common in neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease due to nocturnal motor symptoms, medication timing effects, and hyperarousal contributing to fragmented sleep. This quantitative finding supports behavioral interventions (for example, stimulus control and sleep restriction) within medical psychology.\n\nThe final numeric output required is the sleep efficiency value as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",

            "introduction": "When a patient's condition changes, how do we know if the change is clinically meaningful or simply random noise? This is a fundamental question when tracking cognitive function after a neurological intervention like surgery. This exercise introduces the Reliable Change Index (RCI), a powerful psychometric tool used to determine if an observed change in a neuropsychological test score is statistically significant . By working through this problem, you will learn how to account for measurement error to make more confident judgments about patient outcomes.",

            "problem": "A 57-year-old right-handed person with left mesial temporal lobe epilepsy undergoes neuropsychological evaluation before and six months after a selective amygdalohippocampectomy. The verbal delayed recall composite from an age-appropriate standardized battery is used as the outcome measure. On the pre-surgical evaluation the composite score is $X_{1}=62$, and on the post-surgical evaluation the composite score is $X_{2}=74$. The test manual reports a population standard deviation $SD=12$ for this composite and a test-retest reliability coefficient $r=0.88$ over a six-month interval in a matched clinical sample. Assume errors of measurement across the two occasions are independent, the reliability applies equally to both administrations, and practice effects for this composite are negligible over six months in this age group.\n\nUsing the framework of classical test theory, start from the definition that an observed score $X$ can be decomposed into a true score $T$ and an error score $E$ as $X=T+E$, and that reliability $r$ is defined as $r=\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(T)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}$. Derive the standard error of measurement and the standard error of the difference across two occasions, and then compute the reliable change index (RCI), defined as the observed change scaled by the standard error of the difference. Use a two-tailed significance criterion derived from the standard normal distribution with an $\\alpha=0.05$ family-wise error rate when interpreting the magnitude of the RCI, but express only the numerical RCI as your final answer.\n\nRound your numerical RCI to four significant figures. Express the RCI as a unitless value.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in classical test theory, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We will proceed by first deriving the necessary formulas from the provided first principles, and then computing the final numerical value.\n\nThe problem starts from the fundamental equation of classical test theory, which decomposes an observed score $X$ into a true score $T$ and an error score $E$:\n$$X = T + E$$\nA key assumption is that the error score $E$ has a mean of zero and is uncorrelated with the true score $T$. This implies that the variance of the observed scores is the sum of the variances of the true scores and the error scores:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(T) + \\mathrm{Var}(E)$$\nReliability, $r$, is defined as the proportion of the observed score variance that is attributable to true score variance:\n$$r = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(T)}{\\mathrm{Var}(X)}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the true score variance as $\\mathrm{Var}(T) = r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X)$. Substituting this into the variance decomposition equation gives:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X) = r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X) + \\mathrm{Var}(E)$$\nRearranging this equation allows us to solve for the error variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(E)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E) = \\mathrm{Var}(X) - r \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(X) = \\mathrm{Var}(X)(1-r)$$\nThe standard error of measurement, denoted as $S_E$, is the standard deviation of the error scores. It is the square root of the error variance:\n$$S_E = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(E)} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(X)(1-r)}$$\nSince the standard deviation of the observed scores, $\\mathrm{SD}(X)$, is the square root of the observed score variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(X)$, we can write the formula for $S_E$ as:\n$$S_E = \\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{1-r}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the standard error of measurement.\n\nNext, we derive the standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, between two scores, $X_1$ and $X_2$. The difference score is $D = X_2 - X_1$. Under the null hypothesis that there is no change in the true score ($T_1 = T_2$), any observed difference is entirely due to measurement error:\n$$D = X_2 - X_1 = (T_2 + E_2) - (T_1 + E_1) = (T_2 - T_1) + (E_2 - E_1) = E_2 - E_1$$\nThe variance of this difference is $\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_2 - E_1)$. The variance of a difference between two random variables is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(A-B) = \\mathrm{Var}(A) + \\mathrm{Var}(B) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(A,B)$. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(E_2) - 2\\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2)$$\nThe problem states that we should assume the errors of measurement across the two occasions are independent, which means their covariance is zero: $\\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_1) + \\mathrm{Var}(E_2)$$\nThe variance of the error for any single measurement is the square of the standard error of measurement, $S_E^2$. The problem also states that the reliability applies equally to both administrations, so $S_{E1} = S_{E2} = S_E$. Thus, the variance of the difference is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D) = S_E^2 + S_E^2 = 2S_E^2$$\nThe standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2S_E^2} = S_E \\sqrt{2}$$\nSubstituting our previously derived expression for $S_E$:\n$$S_{diff} = \\left(\\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{1-r}\\right) \\sqrt{2} = \\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{2(1-r)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the standard error of the difference.\n\nFinally, the Reliable Change Index (RCI) is defined as the observed change in scores scaled by the standard error of the difference:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nSubstituting the formula for $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_2 - X_1}{\\mathrm{SD}(X) \\sqrt{2(1-r)}}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nThe givens are:\nPre-surgical score: $X_1 = 62$\nPost-surgical score: $X_2 = 74$\nPopulation standard deviation: $\\mathrm{SD}(X) = 12$\nTest-retest reliability: $r = 0.88$\n\nThe observed change is $X_2 - X_1 = 74 - 62 = 12$.\nThe standard error of the difference is:\n$$S_{diff} = 12 \\sqrt{2(1-0.88)} = 12 \\sqrt{2(0.12)} = 12 \\sqrt{0.24}$$\nNow we compute the RCI:\n$$RCI = \\frac{12}{12 \\sqrt{0.24}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.24}}$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$RCI = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.24}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.4898979...} \\approx 2.04124145...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get $2.041$. The problem also asks for the interpretation based on an $\\alpha=0.05$ significance criterion, which corresponds to a critical value of $\\pm 1.96$ from the standard normal distribution. Since our calculated RCI of $2.041$ exceeds $1.96$, the observed change in verbal delayed recall would be considered statistically reliable. However, only the numerical RCI is to be reported as the final answer.",

            "introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is rarely a matter of certainty; it is often a process of updating probabilities as new evidence becomes available. This is particularly true in neurology, where symptoms can be ambiguous. This practice utilizes Bayes' theorem to tackle a common diagnostic dilemma: differentiating a seizure-related 'fear aura' from a symptom of a comorbid panic disorder . This exercise demonstrates how to formally integrate base rates and new clinical findings to refine diagnostic accuracy, a cornerstone of sophisticated clinical reasoning.",

            "problem": "A liaison clinic jointly staffed by neurology and medical psychology evaluates patients with focal epilepsy, where comorbid panic disorder can complicate symptom appraisal. The clinic tracks patient-reported pre-ictal fear sensations (a “fear aura”) that may be confused with panic phenomena. Let $\\mathrm{panic}$ denote the event that a patient meets criteria for panic disorder, and let $\\mathrm{aura}$ denote the event that a patient reports a fear aura during typical seizures. You are given the following empirically obtained base rates in this clinic population: $P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic}) = 0.40$, $P(\\mathrm{panic}) = 0.22$, and $P(\\mathrm{aura}) = 0.25$. Starting only from the definition of conditional probability and standard probability rules, derive an expression for $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$ that depends on $P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic})$, $P(\\mathrm{panic})$, and $P(\\mathrm{aura})$. Then compute the numerical value of $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$ for this clinic. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express it as a decimal. Finally, in one or two sentences, interpret the posterior probability in terms of how much the report of a fear aura changes a patient’s estimated risk of comorbid panic disorder for risk counseling in this setting.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive an expression for the posterior probability $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$ and compute its value. The derivation will begin from the definition of conditional probability.\n\nThe definition of the conditional probability of an event $A$ given an event $B$ is:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nwhere $P(B) > 0$.\n\nApplying this definition to the events $\\mathrm{panic}$ and $\\mathrm{aura}$, we can write the expression for the desired quantity, $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{panic} \\cap \\mathrm{aura})}{P(\\mathrm{aura})}$$\nThis equation expresses the desired probability in terms of the joint probability $P(\\mathrm{panic} \\cap \\mathrm{aura})$ and the marginal probability $P(\\mathrm{aura})$. The value for $P(\\mathrm{aura})$ is given as $0.25$, but the joint probability is unknown.\n\nTo find the joint probability, we use the definition of conditional probability again, this time for the given quantity $P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic})$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{aura} \\cap \\mathrm{panic})}{P(\\mathrm{panic})}$$\nSince the intersection of events is commutative, $P(\\mathrm{aura} \\cap \\mathrm{panic}) = P(\\mathrm{panic} \\cap \\mathrm{aura})$. We can rearrange the above equation to solve for the joint probability:\n$$P(\\mathrm{panic} \\cap \\mathrm{aura}) = P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic}) \\times P(\\mathrm{panic})$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the joint probability back into our first equation for $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$:\n$$P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura}) = \\frac{P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic}) \\times P(\\mathrm{panic})}{P(\\mathrm{aura})}$$\nThis is the required expression for $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura})$ derived from first principles. This result is a form of Bayes' Theorem.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided probabilities:\n$P(\\mathrm{aura}\\mid \\mathrm{panic}) = 0.40$\n$P(\\mathrm{panic}) = 0.22$\n$P(\\mathrm{aura}) = 0.25$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura}) = \\frac{0.40 \\times 0.22}{0.25}$$\nFirst, we calculate the product in the numerator:\n$$0.40 \\times 0.22 = 0.088$$\nThen, we perform the division:\n$$P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura}) = \\frac{0.088}{0.25} = 0.352$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.352$ already has exactly three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, for the interpretation: The prior probability, or baseline risk, of a patient in this clinic having panic disorder is $P(\\mathrm{panic}) = 0.22$, which is a $22\\%$ risk. Upon learning that the patient reports a fear aura, the updated posterior probability becomes $P(\\mathrm{panic}\\mid \\mathrm{aura}) = 0.352$, or a $35.2\\%$ risk. Therefore, the report of a fear aura substantially increases the estimated probability of a patient having comorbid panic disorder from a baseline of $22\\%$ to approximately $35\\%$. This revised estimate is a clinically meaningful update that justifies further specific assessment for panic disorder.",
