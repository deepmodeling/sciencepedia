The mechanism, QSSA, and conservation law are standard assumptions for deriving the Michaelis-Menten equation. This is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

It is complete, consistent, realistic, and not trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the initial velocity equation starting from the mass-action form of the given mechanism.\n\nThe enzymatic reaction is described by the scheme:\n$$ E + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_2}{\\rightarrow} E + P $$\nwhere $k_1$, $k_{-1}$, and $k_2$ are the rate constants for the respective reaction steps.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_2[ES] $$\nThe first term on the right-hand side represents the formation of the $ES$ complex from the free enzyme $E$ and substrate $S$. The second and third terms represent the breakdown of the $ES$ complex, either back to $E$ and $S$ or forward to $E$ and product $P$.\n\nThe problem states to use the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), which assumes that after a very brief initial transient period, the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ remains approximately constant. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0 $$\nApplying this approximation to the rate equation for $[ES]$:\n$$ k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] = 0 $$\n$$ k_1 [E][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$, is constant and is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the concentration of enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$ [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} = [E] + [ES] $$\nFrom this conservation equation, we can express the free enzyme concentration as:\n$$ [E] = [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [ES] $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[E]$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$ k_1 ([E]_{\\mathrm{T}} - [ES])[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\nOur goal is to solve for $[ES]$ to then find the reaction velocity. We expand and rearrange the equation:\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] - k_1 [ES][S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] = (k_{-1} + k_2)[ES] + k_1 [ES][S] $$\n$$ k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S] = [ES] (k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]) $$\nSolving for $[ES]$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{k_1 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{k_{-1} + k_2 + k_1[S]} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_1$:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} + [S]} $$\nThe Michaelis constant, $K_m$, is defined as the collection of rate constants $\\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1}$.\n$$ K_m = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_2}{k_1} $$\nSubstituting $K_m$ into the expression for $[ES]$ gives:\n$$ [ES] = \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe initial reaction velocity, $v$, is defined as the rate of formation of the product, $P$. Under the specified initial rate conditions, the reverse reaction $E+P \\rightarrow ES$ is negligible.\n$$ v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2 [ES] $$\nSubstituting the steady-state expression for $[ES]$ into the velocity equation:\n$$ v = k_2 \\left( \\frac{[E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThe maximal velocity, $V_{\\max}$, is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with the substrate, i.e., when $[ES] = [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$. In this case, the velocity is $v = k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}}$. We therefore define:\n$$ V_{\\max} = k_2 [E]_{\\mathrm{T}} $$\nSubstituting $V_{\\max}$ into the velocity equation yields the final analytical expression, known as the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nNext, we evaluate the initial velocity $v$ using the provided values. The problem specifies the initial substrate concentration $[S]_0$ as the value for $[S]$ in the velocity equation.\nGiven:\n-   $V_{\\max} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$\n-   $K_{m} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $[S] = [S]_0 = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{(100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min})(2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M})}{5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} $$\n$$ v = \\frac{200}{7}\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\n$$ v \\approx 28.571428... \\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the numerical velocity to four significant figures.\n$$ v \\approx 28.57\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min} $$\n\n### Interpretation\n\nFinally, we must interpret whether the reaction is substrate-limited. This is determined by comparing the substrate concentration $[S]$ to the Michaelis constant $K_m$.\n-   $[S] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $K_{m} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nWe observe that $[S]  K_m$. Specifically, $[S] = 0.4\\,K_m$.\n\nThe Michaelis constant $K_m$ represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of its maximum ($v = V_{\\max}/2$ when $[S] = K_m$).\n\nThere are three kinetic regimes for this system:\n1.  When $[S] \\ll K_m$: The denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx K_m$, so $v \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}[S]$. The velocity is approximately first-order with respect to $[S]$ and is highly sensitive to changes in substrate concentration. This is the **substrate-limited** regime.\n2.  When $[S] \\gg K_m$: The denominator $K_m + [S] \\approx [S]$, so $v \\approx \\frac{V_{\\max}[S]}{[S]} = V_{\\max}$. The velocity is approximately zero-order with respect to $[S]$ and is insensitive to changes in substrate concentration. The reaction is limited by the enzyme's catalytic turnover rate, not substrate availability. This is the **enzyme-limited** or **saturation** regime.\n3.  When $[S] \\approx K_m$: The reaction exhibits mixed-order kinetics.\n\nIn the present case, since $[S] = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is less than $K_m = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, the reaction is operating in a regime where the velocity is strongly dependent on the substrate concentration. Our calculated velocity $v \\approx 28.57\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$ is only $28.57\\%$ of the maximal velocity $V_{\\max} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$, which is significantly below the half-maximal velocity of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M/min}$. This confirms that the enzyme population is far from saturated. Therefore, at the given conditions, the reaction is **substrate-limited**.",
