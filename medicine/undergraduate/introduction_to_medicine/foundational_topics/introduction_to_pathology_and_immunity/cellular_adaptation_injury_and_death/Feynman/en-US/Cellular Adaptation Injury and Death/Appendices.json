I will first validate the problem statement, then proceed with the solution if it is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System**: A mammalian cell suspended in isotonic extracellular fluid.\n- **Event**: Failure of the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase) pump.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1. Water crosses the membrane rapidly to maintain osmotic equilibrium.\n    2. Non-sodium intracellular solutes are effectively impermeant.\n    3. The total number of osmoles of these impermeant solutes is conserved.\n    4. Hydrostatic pressure differences are negligible.\n    5. Solutions behave ideally, meaning osmotic pressure is proportional to total osmolarity.\n- **Constants and Conditions**:\n    - Extracellular osmolarity, $O_{ext}$, is constant at $300$ milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).\n    - Initial intracellular sodium concentration, $[Na^+]_{i, \\text{initial}} = 10$ millimoles per liter (mmol/L).\n    - Initial cell volume, $V_i = 1$ picoliter (pL).\n    - Final intracellular sodium concentration after re-equilibration, $[Na^+]_{i, \\text{final}} = 40$ mmol/L.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness**: The problem is scientifically sound. It describes a classic and fundamental physiological process: osmotic swelling of a cell following the failure of the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase. The failure of this pump leads to an influx of Na$^+$ ions down their electrochemical gradient, increasing the intracellular solute concentration and causing water to enter the cell via osmosis. The provided values for osmolarity ($300$ mOsm/L), intracellular sodium concentration ($10$ mmol/L), and cell volume ($1$ pL) are physiologically realistic. The assumptions are standard simplifications used to make such problems tractable.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is formalizable using the principles of osmosis and conservation of mass. It pertains directly to cellular injury, a core topic in medicine.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem provides all necessary information and principles to derive a unique solution. The initial state is defined, the final state is partially defined, and the physical laws governing the transition (conservation of impermeant solutes and osmotic equilibrium) are specified. There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The conditions are physically possible and common in physiological contexts (e.g., ischemia leading to ATP depletion and pump failure).\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. A unique and stable solution for the final cell volume exists based on the provided data and constraints.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise that requires a multi-step application of physical principles to a biological model. It is a valid test of understanding.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The principles and phenomena are all well-established and verifiable within the fields of physiology and biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires us to calculate the new cell volume, $V_f$, after the Na$^+$/K$^+$ ATPase pump fails. We start by analyzing the initial and final states of the cell based on the principles of osmotic equilibrium and conservation of impermeant solutes. For ideal dilute solutions, osmotic pressure is proportional to osmolarity. The problem assumes sodium salts dissociate completely, so a concentration in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) is equivalent to milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L) for species like Na$^+$.\n\n**1. Analyze the Initial State**\nThe cell is initially in an isotonic solution, meaning the intracellular osmolarity, $O_{i, \\text{initial}}$, is equal to the extracellular osmolarity, $O_{ext}$.\n$$O_{i, \\text{initial}} = O_{ext} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\nThe total intracellular osmolarity is the sum of the concentrations of all solutes. The problem groups these into sodium ions ($Na^+$) and a collection of effectively impermeant solutes ($I$).\n$$O_{i, \\text{initial}} = [Na^+]_{i, \\text{initial}} + [I]_{i, \\text{initial}}$$\nWe are given $[Na^+]_{i, \\text{initial}} = 10 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. We can therefore calculate the initial concentration of impermeant solutes, $[I]_{i, \\text{initial}}$.\n$$[I]_{i, \\text{initial}} = O_{i, \\text{initial}} - [Na^+]_{i, \\text{initial}} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} - 10 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 290 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\nThe total number of osmoles of these impermeant solutes, $n_I$, is conserved throughout the process. We can express this amount as the product of their initial concentration and the initial cell volume, $V_i$.\n$$n_I = [I]_{i, \\text{initial}} \\times V_i$$\n\n**2. Analyze the Final State**\nAfter the pump fails, sodium ions enter the cell, increasing the intracellular solute concentration. Water follows by osmosis, causing the cell to swell to a new volume, $V_f$. A new steady state is reached where osmotic equilibrium is re-established. At this point, the final intracellular osmolarity, $O_{i, \\text{final}}$, must again equal the constant extracellular osmolarity.\n$$O_{i, \\text{final}} = O_{ext} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\nThe final intracellular osmolarity is the sum of the new sodium concentration, $[Na^+]_{i, \\text{final}}$, and the new impermeant solute concentration, $[I]_{i, \\text{final}}$.\n$$O_{i, \\text{final}} = [Na^+]_{i, \\text{final}} + [I]_{i, \\text{final}}$$\nWe are given that $[Na^+]_{i, \\text{final}} = 40 \\text{ mOsm/L}$. We can now find the final concentration of the impermeant solutes.\n$$[I]_{i, \\text{final}} = O_{i, \\text{final}} - [Na^+]_{i, \\text{final}} = 300 \\text{ mOsm/L} - 40 \\text{ mOsm/L} = 260 \\text{ mOsm/L}$$\n\n**3. Derive and Calculate the Final Volume**\nThe number of osmoles of impermeant solutes, $n_I$, is conserved. Therefore, the amount present initially is the same as the amount present in the final state.\n$$n_I = [I]_{i, \\text{initial}} \\times V_i = [I]_{i, \\text{final}} \\times V_f$$\nThis gives us the relationship needed to compute the new cell volume, $V_f$. We can rearrange this equation to solve for $V_f$:\n$$V_f = V_i \\times \\frac{[I]_{i, \\text{initial}}}{[I]_{i, \\text{final}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the known values into this equation. The initial volume is $V_i = 1$ pL.\n$$V_f = 1 \\text{ pL} \\times \\frac{290 \\text{ mOsm/L}}{260 \\text{ mOsm/L}}$$\nThe units of osmolarity cancel, giving the final volume in picoliters.\n$$V_f = \\frac{290}{260} \\text{ pL} = \\frac{29}{26} \\text{ pL}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$V_f \\approx 1.1153846... \\text{ pL}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V_f \\approx 1.115 \\text{ pL}$$\nThis result confirms that the cell has swollen, as expected from the net influx of solute (sodium) followed by water.",

The fractions of the total population corresponding to these events are given as:\n$$F(A) = 0.70$$\n$$F(P) = 0.20$$\n\nThe problem defines four mutually exclusive cell populations based on the status of these two markers. Let us express these populations and their fractions in terms of events $A$ and $P$.\n- **Viable cells ($\\text{annexin V}^{-}, \\text{PI}^{-}$):** These cells are negative for both markers. This corresponds to the complement of the union of $A$ and $P$. Let the fraction be $F_{\\text{viable}}$.\n$$F_{\\text{viable}} = F(A^c \\cap P^c) = F((A \\cup P)^c) = 1 - F(A \\cup P)$$\n- **Early apoptotic cells ($\\text{annexin V}^{+}, \\text{PI}^{-}$):** These cells are positive for annexin V but negative for PI. This corresponds to the set difference $A \\setminus P$. Let the fraction be $F_{\\text{early}}$.\n$$F_{\\text{early}} = F(A \\cap P^c)$$\n- **Late apoptotic or necrotic cells ($\\text{annexin V}^{+}, \\text{PI}^{+}$):** These cells are positive for both markers. This corresponds to the intersection of $A$ and $P$. Let the fraction be $F_{\\text{late}}$.\n$$F_{\\text{late}} = F(A \\cap P)$$\n- **Primary necrotic cells ($\\text{annexin V}^{-}, \\text{PI}^{+}$):** These cells are negative for annexin V but positive for PI. This corresponds to the set difference $P \\setminus A$. The problem states this population is negligible.\n$$F(P \\cap A^c) \\approx 0$$\n\nThe crucial assumption is that $\\text{PI}^{+}$ events are a subset of $\\text{annexin V}^{+}$ events. In set-theoretic terms, this means $P \\subseteq A$. This formalizes the condition of negligible primary necrosis, as it implies that the set of cells that are in $P$ but not in $A$ is empty.\nIf $P \\subseteq A$, several consequences follow:\n1.  The intersection of $P$ and $A$ is simply $P$: $A \\cap P = P$.\n2.  The union of $P$ and $A$ is simply $A$: $A \\cup P = A$.\n\nUsing these consequences, we can now calculate the required fractions.\n\n**1. Fraction of late apoptotic or necrotic cells ($F_{\\text{late}}$):**\nThis fraction is given by $F(A \\cap P)$. Since $P \\subseteq A$, we have $A \\cap P = P$.\nTherefore, the fraction of late apoptotic/necrotic cells is equal to the fraction of PI-positive cells.\n$$F_{\\text{late}} = F(A \\cap P) = F(P) = 0.20$$\n\n**2. Fraction of early apoptotic cells ($F_{\\text{early}}$):**\nThis fraction is given by $F(A \\cap P^c)$. From the law of total probability, the fraction of all annexin V positive cells, $F(A)$, can be decomposed as:\n$$F(A) = F(A \\cap P) + F(A \\cap P^c)$$\nRearranging for $F(A \\cap P^c)$, which is $F_{\\text{early}}$, we get:\n$$F_{\\text{early}} = F(A) - F(A \\cap P)$$\nSubstituting the result from the previous step, $F(A \\cap P) = F(P)$:\n$$F_{\\text{early}} = F(A) - F(P) = 0.70 - 0.20 = 0.50$$\n\n**3. Fraction of viable cells ($F_{\\text{viable}}$):**\nThis fraction is given by $1 - F(A \\cup P)$. Since $P \\subseteq A$, we have $A \\cup P = A$.\nTherefore, the fraction of viable cells is:\n$$F_{\\text{viable}} = 1 - F(A \\cup P) = 1 - F(A) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\n\nTo verify the result, the sum of the fractions of all mutually exclusive populations must equal $1$. The populations are viable, early apoptotic, and late apoptotic/necrotic (since primary necrotic is zero).\n$$F_{\\text{viable}} + F_{\\text{early}} + F_{\\text{late}} = 0.30 + 0.50 + 0.20 = 1.00$$\nThe calculation is internally consistent. The requested fractions in the specified order (early apoptotic, late apoptotic or necrotic, viable) are $0.50$, $0.20$, and $0.30$.",
