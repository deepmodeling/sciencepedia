            "problem": "A healthy adult with normal hepatobiliary physiology maintains a relatively constant bile acid pool via the enterohepatic circulation. The pool of bile acids has mass $B$ and is secreted into the intestinal lumen and then reabsorbed multiple times per day. In each enterohepatic cycle, a small fraction of the pool is not reabsorbed and is lost in feces. Under steady-state conditions, the pool size does not change over days, and the liver synthesizes new bile acids to replace the amount lost in feces.\n\nSuppose the bile acid pool size is $B = 3\\ \\mathrm{g}$, the pool completes $n = 6$ enterohepatic cycles per day, and the fractional fecal loss per cycle is $f = 0.05$. Assume there are no other routes of loss or gain besides fecal loss and hepatic synthesis, and that steady state holds over the day.\n\nUsing conservation of mass and the definitions above, determine the daily rate of de novo bile acid synthesis. Express your final answer in grams per day and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The fundamental principle governing this problem is the conservation of mass under steady-state conditions. The problem states that the bile acid pool size, $B$, is maintained at a constant level. This implies that the rate at which bile acids are synthesized by the liver must be equal to the rate at which they are lost from the body.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nThe total mass of the bile acid pool is $B = 3\\ \\mathrm{g}$.\nThe number of enterohepatic cycles per day is $n = 6$.\nThe fractional loss of bile acids in the feces per cycle is $f = 0.05$.\n\nWe are asked to determine the daily rate of de novo bile acid synthesis, which we will denote as $S_{\\text{daily}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the mass of bile acids lost in a single enterohepatic cycle. The problem states that the pool of mass $B$ completes $n$ cycles per day, and in each cycle, a fraction $f$ of the pool is lost. Assuming the entire pool mass $B$ is secreted and circulated in each cycle, the mass of bile acids lost in one cycle, $L_{\\text{cycle}}$, is given by the product of the pool size and the fractional loss per cycle:\n$$L_{\\text{cycle}} = B \\times f$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total mass of bile acids lost over the course of one day. Since there are $n$ cycles per day, the total daily loss, $L_{\\text{daily}}$, is the loss per cycle multiplied by the number of cycles per day:\n$$L_{\\text{daily}} = L_{\\text{cycle}} \\times n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{\\text{cycle}}$, we get:\n$$L_{\\text{daily}} = (B \\times f) \\times n = n f B$$\n\nAccording to the steady-state assumption, the system is in equilibrium, which means the rate of synthesis must equal the rate of loss. Therefore, the daily rate of de novo synthesis, $S_{\\text{daily}}$, is equal to the total daily loss, $L_{\\text{daily}}$.\n$$S_{\\text{daily}} = L_{\\text{daily}} = n f B$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$B = 3\\ \\mathrm{g}$\n$n = 6\\ \\text{cycles/day}$\n$f = 0.05\\ \\text{per cycle}$\n\n$$S_{\\text{daily}} = 6 \\times 0.05 \\times 3\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n$$S_{\\text{daily}} = 0.30 \\times 3\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n$$S_{\\text{daily}} = 0.9\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in grams per day and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $0.9$. To express this to three significant figures, we write it as $0.900$.\n\nThus, the daily rate of de novo bile acid synthesis is $0.900\\ \\mathrm{g/day}$.",

            "solution": "### Derivation\nWe begin by establishing the fundamental relationships based on mass balance and the definitions of the pharmacokinetic parameters.\n\n1.  **Mass Balance:** At steady-state, the rate of drug elimination by the liver is equal to the rate at which the drug enters the liver minus the rate at which it leaves.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = (\\text{Rate in}) - (\\text{Rate out}) $$\n    The rate of drug transport is the product of blood flow ($Q$) and drug concentration.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = Q \\cdot C_{in} - Q \\cdot C_{out} = Q(C_{in} - C_{out}) $$\n\n2.  **Hepatic Clearance ($CL_H$):** Hepatic clearance is defined as the volume of blood entering the liver that is completely cleared of the drug per unit time. It relates the total rate of elimination to the drug concentration at the inlet.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = CL_H \\cdot C_{in} $$\n\n3.  **Extraction Ratio ($E$):** The extraction ratio is the dimensionless fraction of drug removed from the blood during its passage through the liver.\n    $$ E = \\frac{\\text{Rate of drug eliminated}}{\\text{Rate of drug entering}} = \\frac{Q(C_{in} - C_{out})}{Q \\cdot C_{in}} = \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} $$\n    By equating the two expressions for the rate of elimination from points 1 and 2, we find a direct relationship between $CL_H$, $Q$, and $E$:\n    $$ CL_H \\cdot C_{in} = Q(C_{in} - C_{out}) $$\n    $$ CL_H = Q \\frac{C_{in} - C_{out}}{C_{in}} \\implies CL_H = Q \\cdot E $$\n\n4.  **Intrinsic Clearance ($CL_{int}$):** Intrinsic clearance describes the inherent metabolic capacity of the liver enzymes, independent of limitations imposed by blood flow or protein binding. The rate of metabolism is driven by the *unbound* concentration of the drug within the liver, $C_{u, H}$.\n    $$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = CL_{int} \\cdot C_{u, H} $$\n\n5.  **Well-Stirred Model Assumption:** This model posits that the liver is a single, perfectly mixed compartment. This implies that the drug concentration is uniform throughout the liver and is equal to the drug concentration in the blood leaving the liver. Therefore, the unbound concentration within the liver ($C_{u, H}$) is equal to the unbound concentration in the hepatic venous blood.\n    $$ C_{u, H} = f_u \\cdot C_{out} $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for the rate of elimination from point 4:\n    $$ \\text{Rate of elimination} = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot C_{out} $$\n\n6.  **Final Derivation:** We now equate the mass balance expression for the rate of elimination (from point 1) with the intrinsic clearance-based expression (from point 5).\n    $$ Q(C_{in} - C_{out}) = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot C_{out} $$\n    Our goal is to find an expression for $CL_H$ that depends only on $Q$, $f_u$, and $CL_{int}$. To do this, we first solve for the ratio $C_{out}/C_{in}$.\n    $$ Q \\cdot C_{in} - Q \\cdot C_{out} = CL_{int} \\cdot f_u \\cdot C_{out} $$\n    $$ Q \\cdot C_{in} = (Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) \\cdot C_{out} $$\n    $$ \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = \\frac{Q}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n    Now, we can find the expression for the extraction ratio, $E$:\n    $$ E = 1 - \\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}} = 1 - \\frac{Q}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = \\frac{(Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}) - Q}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n    $$ E = \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n    This is the dependence of $E$ on the given quantities under the well-stirred assumption.\n\n    Finally, using the relationship $CL_H = Q \\cdot E$, we derive the expression for hepatic clearance:\n    $$ CL_H = Q \\cdot \\left( \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} \\right) = \\frac{Q \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- $Q = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min}$\n- $f_u = 0.1$\n- $CL_{int} = 120\\ \\mathrm{L/min}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product $f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$, which represents the intrinsic clearance of unbound drug.\n$$ f_u \\cdot CL_{int} = 0.1 \\cdot 120\\ \\mathrm{L/min} = 12\\ \\mathrm{L/min} $$\n\nNow, we can compute $CL_H$ using the derived formula:\n$$ CL_H = \\frac{Q \\cdot (f_u \\cdot CL_{int})}{Q + (f_u \\cdot CL_{int})} = \\frac{1.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min} \\cdot 12\\ \\mathrm{L/min}}{1.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min} + 12\\ \\mathrm{L/min}} $$\n$$ CL_H = \\frac{18\\ (\\mathrm{L/min})^2}{13.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\ \\mathrm{L/min} \\approx 1.333...\\ \\mathrm{L/min} $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $CL_H = 1.33\\ \\mathrm{L/min}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the extraction ratio $E$. We can use the simple relationship $E = CL_H / Q$.\n$$ E = \\frac{CL_H}{Q} = \\frac{(4/3)\\ \\mathrm{L/min}}{1.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min}} = \\frac{4/3}{3/2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.888...\\ $$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, $E = 0.889$.\n\nAs a check, we can use the formula derived for $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = \\frac{12\\ \\mathrm{L/min}}{1.5\\ \\mathrm{L/min} + 12\\ \\mathrm{L/min}} = \\frac{12}{13.5} = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.889 $$\nThe results are consistent.\n\nAccording to the provided criteria, since $E = 0.889 > 0.7$, this drug is classified as a \"high extraction\" drug.\nThe final numerical values to report are $CL_H \\approx 1.33$ and $E \\approx 0.889$.",

            "problem": "A research team is modeling the early steps of pancreatic zymogen control to understand why certain families with a cationic trypsinogen mutation develop recurrent pancreatitis. In healthy physiology, pancreatic acinar cells package proteases as inactive zymogens; trypsinogen is normally activated in the duodenal lumen by enteropeptidase. Within the pancreas, protective mechanisms include low basal activity of trypsin, rapid inhibition by Pancreatic Secretory Trypsin Inhibitor (SPINK1), and facilitated degradation of misactivated trypsin or trypsinogen by chymotrypsin C (CTRC). The team frames a minimal kinetic description for intrapancreatic trypsin dynamics during a perturbation as\n$$\\frac{d[T]}{dt} = k_a[Z][T] - k_d[T] - k_i[S][T],$$\nwhere $[T]$ is active trypsin concentration, $[Z]$ is trypsinogen concentration, $[S]$ is SPINK1 concentration, $k_a$ is the autoactivation rate constant (reflecting trypsin-mediated conversion of trypsinogen to trypsin), $k_d$ is the effective degradation/inactivation rate constant (including CTRC-mediated processes), and $k_i$ is the effective inhibitory constant for SPINK1 binding to trypsin. In this model, an “activation threshold” is the minimal transient $[T]$ that, given fixed $[Z]$, $[S]$, $k_a$, $k_d$, and $k_i$, results in a net positive growth of $[T]$ due to autocatalysis, thereby risking a self-amplifying cascade of zymogen activation within the pancreas.\n\nA family carries a gain-of-function cationic trypsinogen mutation. Biophysical characterization shows that, relative to wild type, the mutant trypsinogen has an increased $k_a$ and is less susceptible to CTRC-mediated degradation, effectively lowering $k_d$, while $[S]$ and $k_i$ are unchanged. Assume $[Z]$ and ductal flow and bicarbonate secretion are physiologically normal.\n\nWhich option best predicts the consequences of this mutation for the intrapancreatic activation threshold and the clinical risk of pancreatitis?\n\nA. The mutation lowers the activation threshold because the net growth term $k_a[Z] - (k_d + k_i[S])$ increases, allowing physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-driven fluctuations to trigger runaway activation; recurrent acute pancreatitis risk increases even without ductal obstruction.\n\nB.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe dynamics of the active trypsin concentration, $[T]$, are given by the rate equation:\n$$\\frac{d[T]}{dt} = k_a[Z][T] - k_d[T] - k_i[S][T]$$\nTo determine the condition for net positive growth of $[T]$, we can factor $[T]$ out from the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$\\frac{d[T]}{dt} = \\left( k_a[Z] - k_d - k_i[S] \\right) [T]$$\nThe problem defines the \"activation threshold\" in terms of achieving a net positive growth of $[T]$, which mathematically corresponds to the condition $\\frac{d[T]}{dt} > 0$. Assuming a non-zero initial concentration of active trypsin ($[T]>0$) is present to potentially start the cascade, the sign of $\\frac{d[T]}{dt}$ is determined by the sign of the term in the parenthesis.\nTherefore, a self-amplifying cascade of trypsin activation occurs if and only if:\n$$k_a[Z] - k_d - k_i[S] > 0$$\nThis can be rewritten as a condition comparing the rate of activation to the combined rates of degradation and inhibition:\n$$k_a[Z] > k_d + k_i[S]$$\n\nIn a healthy pancreas, the system is stable, meaning that protective mechanisms outweigh basal autoactivation. This implies:\n$$k_a[Z]  k_d + k_i[S]$$\nUnder these conditions, $\\frac{d[T]}{dt}  0$, and any small, transient amount of active trypsin is rapidly degraded or inhibited, preventing a pathological cascade.\n\nThe problem describes a mutation with the following effects:\n1.  $k_a$ increases.\n2.  $k_d$ decreases.\n3.  $[Z]$, $[S]$, and $k_i$ are unchanged.\n\nLet us analyze the impact of these changes on the \"net growth term,\" which we can define as $\\mathcal{G} = k_a[Z] - k_d - k_i[S]$.\n- The increase in $k_a$ makes the positive term $k_a[Z]$ larger.\n- The decrease in $k_d$ makes the negative term $-k_d$ less negative (i.e., it contributes positively to the sum).\nBoth of these changes cause the overall value of $\\mathcal{G}$ to increase. This pushes the system's state from the stable regime ($\\mathcal{G}  0$) closer to, or into, the unstable, runaway activation regime ($\\mathcal{G} > 0$).\n\nA \"lower activation threshold\" means that the system is more easily tipped into the state of runaway activation. Since the mutation increases the value of $\\mathcal{G}$, the system becomes less stable. A smaller perturbation or physiological fluctuation is now sufficient to initiate a self-amplifying cascade. Therefore, the mutation effectively lowers the activation threshold.\n\nThis increased propensity for intrapancreatic trypsin activation leads to autodigestion of the pancreas and inflammation, which is the definition of pancreatitis. Because this predisposition is genetic and not dependent on an external factor like ductal obstruction, it would lead to an increased risk of recurrent acute pancreatitis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The mutation lowers the activation threshold because the net growth term $k_a[Z] - (k_d + k_i[S])$ increases, allowing physiological $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$-driven fluctuations to trigger runaway activation; recurrent acute pancreatitis risk increases even without ductal obstruction.**\n- **Analysis**: Our derivation shows that the mutation (increased $k_a$, decreased $k_d$) causes the term $k_a[Z] - k_d - k_i[S]$ to increase. This makes the condition for positive growth ($\\frac{d[T]}{dt} > 0$) easier to satisfy, which corresponds to a \"lower activation threshold\". A system closer to this threshold is more susceptible to small triggers, such as physiological fluctuations. This increased likelihood of runaway intrapancreatic trypsin activation directly increases the risk of pancreatitis, and since the cause is genetic, it is independent of factors like ductal obstruction. This statement is fully consistent with our analysis.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The mutation increases susceptibility to CTRC degradation, which raises the activation threshold and decreases pancreatitis risk.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement claims the mutation \"increases susceptibility to CTRC degradation\". The problem explicitly states the mutant is \"less susceptible to CTRC-mediated degradation, effectively lowering $k_d$\". This is a direct contradiction of a given fact.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The mutation primarily increases ductal bicarbonate secretion, reducing protein plug formation and lowering pancreatitis risk despite any change in trypsinogen kinetics.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement contradicts the explicit assumption given in the problem: \"ductal flow and bicarbonate secretion are physiologically normal\". The problem specifies that the mutation's effects are on the kinetic parameters of trypsinogen, not on ductal function.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The mutation decreases SPINK1 binding affinity (lower $k_i$), which alone explains the phenotype; the activation threshold is unchanged unless $[S]$ is also altered.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement makes two false claims. First, it states the mutation involves a lower $k_i$. The problem explicitly states that $[S]$ and $k_i$ are \"unchanged\". Second, it claims the activation threshold is unchanged, which is false; our analysis demonstrated that the changes in $k_a$ and $k_d$ alter the threshold.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The mutation has no intrapancreatic effect because trypsinogen activation only occurs in the duodenum by enteropeptidase; pancreatitis risk is unchanged.**\n- **Analysis**: This statement ignores the central premise of the problem and the established pathophysiology of pancreatitis. While physiological activation of the bulk of trypsinogen occurs in the duodenum, the entire basis for pancreatitis risk from zymogen mutations is the pathological, premature activation of a small amount of trypsinogen *within* the pancreas. The problem's kinetic model is specifically designed to describe these rare but critical intrapancreatic events.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
