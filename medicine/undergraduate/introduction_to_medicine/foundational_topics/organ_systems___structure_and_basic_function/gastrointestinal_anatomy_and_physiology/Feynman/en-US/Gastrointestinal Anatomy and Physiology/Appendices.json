            "problem": "A biopsy from an unknown segment of the human Gastrointestinal (GI) tract shows the following features under light microscopy: the mucosa is lined by simple columnar epithelium with prominent fingerlike villi and interspersed crypts; the lamina propria contains scattered lymphoid cells but lacks large organized aggregates; the submucosa contains abundant compound mucous glands that stain pale and secrete alkaline material; goblet cells are present at a moderate density within the epithelium, less than in large intestine; the muscularis externa exhibits an inner circular and outer longitudinal organization without an additional oblique component, and there are no thickened longitudinal bands.

            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated first, following the specified protocol.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe given histological features of an unknown segment of the human Gastrointestinal (GI) tract are:\n- **Mucosa:** Lined by simple columnar epithelium with prominent fingerlike villi and interspersed crypts.\n- **Lamina Propria:** Contains scattered lymphoid cells but lacks large organized aggregates.\n- **Submucosa:** Contains abundant compound mucous glands that stain pale and secrete alkaline material.\n- **Goblet Cells:** Present at a moderate density within the epithelium, less than in the large intestine.\n- **Muscularis Externa:** Exhibits an inner circular and outer longitudinal organization without an additional oblique component, and there are no thickened longitudinal bands.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the criteria for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a specific set of histological features. These features are standard characteristics used in histology to identify different regions of the mammalian gastrointestinal tract. The combination of features described is a classic presentation of a particular segment of the small intestine. The problem is firmly based on established principles of human anatomy and physiology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of specific, non-contradictory observations and asks for an identification and functional justification based on those observations. The given features are distinctive enough to permit a unique identification among the major GI segments. Therefore, a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The language used is descriptive, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based claims. It lists observable microscopic features.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws that would render it invalid:\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** The description is factually sound and consistent with known human histology.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is a direct application of anatomical form to physiological function, which is a core concept in biology and medicine. It is relevant to the topic of gastrointestinal anatomy and physiology.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The information provided is sufficient and internally consistent. The presence of villi points to the small intestine, and the presence of submucosal glands is the key diagnostic feature for the duodenum.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The described tissue is a realistic representation of a human biopsy sample.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The question is structured to lead to a single definitive answer based on the evidence.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires a solid understanding of GI histology and the ability to synthesize multiple pieces of evidence, representing a legitimate educational challenge.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The claims are verifiable through standard histological examination.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe identification of the GI segment is based on a systematic analysis of the provided histological features, comparing them with the known characteristics of the different parts of the GI tract.\n\n1.  **Mucosal Architecture:** The presence of \"prominent fingerlike villi and interspersed crypts\" lined by simple columnar epithelium definitively places the segment within the small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, or ileum). It rules out the esophagus (stratified squamous epithelium, no villi), the stomach (gastric pits and glands, no villi), and the colon (deep crypts, no villi).\n\n2.  **Submucosal Glands:** The presence of \"abundant compound mucous glands that stain pale and secrete alkaline material\" in the submucosa is the most pathognomonic feature provided. These are known as Brunner's glands, and they are uniquely characteristic of the **duodenum**. Their function is to secrete an alkaline mucoid fluid to neutralize the acidic chyme arriving from the stomach, thereby protecting the duodenal mucosa and creating an optimal pH for pancreatic enzyme activity.\n\n3.  **Lymphoid Tissue:** The statement that the lamina propria \"lacks large organized aggregates\" of lymphoid cells is significant. The terminal ileum is characterized by the presence of very large, organized lymphoid aggregates known as Peyer's patches. The absence of these structures makes the terminal ileum an unlikely candidate.\n\n4.  **Muscularis Externa:** The description of a two-layered muscularis externa (\"inner circular and outer longitudinal organization\") without an \"additional oblique component\" rules out the stomach, which possesses a third, inner oblique layer. The absence of \"thickened longitudinal bands\" (taeniae coli) rules out the large intestine (colon). This feature is consistent with the small intestine.\n\n5.  **Goblet Cells:** A \"moderate density\" of goblet cells is consistent with the small intestine. Goblet cell density increases progressively from the duodenum to the ileum and is highest in the colon. The stated density is fully compatible with the duodenum.\n\n**Synthesis:** The combination of villi, crypts, and a two-layered muscularis externa localizes the sample to the small intestine. The critical, definitive feature is the presence of abundant submucosal glands (Brunner's glands), which are found only in the duodenum. The lack of large lymphoid aggregates further distinguishes it from the ileum. Therefore, the biopsy must be from the duodenum, likely the proximal portion where Brunner's glands are most numerous. The physiological roles of the duodenum directly follow from this structure: neutralization of acid, initiation of enzymatic digestion, and absorption of specific nutrients like iron ($\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$) and calcium ($\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$).\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Jejunum; maximizes macronutrient absorption because of very extensive plicae circulares and long villi; minimal need for alkaline mucus, so submucosal glands are sparse.**\nThis option describes the jejunum correctly in terms of its primary role in absorption, which is facilitated by long villi and prominent plicae circulares. However, the jejunum characteristically **lacks** submucosal glands. The problem statement explicitly mentions \"abundant compound mucous glands\" in the submucosa. This directly contradicts the provided evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Terminal ileum; specialized for bile salt and vitamin $\\mathrm{B_{12}}$ uptake with abundant lymphoid aggregates (Peyer’s patches); villi are shorter, and goblet cells are numerous.**\nThis option correctly describes the specialized functions of the terminal ileum. However, it states that the ileum has \"abundant lymphoid aggregates (Peyer's patches)\". The problem specifies that the sample \"lacks large organized aggregates\". Additionally, the villi in the ileum are typically shorter and more club-shaped than the \"prominent fingerlike villi\" described.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Proximal duodenum; adapts to neutralize acidic chyme using bicarbonate-rich mucus from submucosal glands, coordinates delivery of bile and pancreatic enzymes for initial chemical digestion, and begins selective absorption (including iron as $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ and calcium).**\nThis option correctly identifies the segment as the proximal duodenum. Its justification aligns perfectly with the provided histological data. The \"bicarbonate-rich mucus from submucosal glands\" corresponds to the \"abundant compound mucous glands that secrete alkaline material\" (Brunner's glands). The fingerlike villi are characteristic of the duodenum. The physiological roles mentioned—neutralization of chyme, receiving digestive enzymes, and absorbing specific minerals like iron ($\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$) and calcium—are the principal functions of the duodenum. This option provides a perfect structure-function correlation consistent with all givens.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Colon; specializes in water and electrolyte reclamation with deep straight crypts, absence of villi, abundant goblet cells, and thickened longitudinal muscle bands.**\nThis option describes the colon. The colon is characterized by the **absence of villi** and the presence of **thickened longitudinal muscle bands (taeniae coli)**. The problem statement explicitly describes \"prominent fingerlike villi\" and the absence of such bands. This option is in direct contradiction with the evidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Stomach body; focuses on acid and pepsinogen secretion from gastric glands, has rugae rather than villi, and features three muscular layers including an inner oblique fiber layer.**\nThis option describes the stomach. The stomach is characterized by the **absence of villi** (it has gastric pits) and the presence of a **third, inner oblique muscle layer**. The problem statement specifies the presence of villi and only two muscle layers (inner circular, outer longitudinal). This option is falsified by the provided data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

This exercise will guide you through a quantitative estimation, using geometric first principles to calculate how mucosal folds, villi, and microvilli work together to amplify the absorptive surface area. By building the model from the ground up, you will gain a deeper, more intuitive understanding of this remarkable structure-function relationship. ",
            "id": "4958275",
            "problem": "You are asked to estimate how mucosal specializations increase the absorptive surface area of the human small intestine using first-principles geometric reasoning. Model the small intestine as a uniform, smooth-walled cylinder of inner length $L$ and inner diameter $d$, and then progressively incorporate three levels of mucosal surface structure: folds of Kerckring (plicae circulares), villi, and microvilli. Use the following physiologically reasonable dimensions and assumptions:\n\n- Cylinder: $L = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $d = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- Folds of Kerckring: model each fold as a thin circumferential ridge of height $h_{p}$ with negligible crest width, spaced regularly by $s_{p}$ along the axial direction. Use $h_{p} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $s_{p} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Assume these folds are present uniformly along the cylinder, and approximate the added area from each fold as the two vertical side bands that wrap around the circumference.\n- Villi: approximate each villus as a circular cylinder of height $h_{v}$ and radius $a$ with a flat top. Use $h_{v} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and a uniform areal density $D_{v} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$ on the mucosal surface that contains the folds. Account for the fact that each villus footprint displaces an equal area of the underlying flat mucosa.\n- Microvilli: approximate each microvillus as a circular cylinder of length $l_{m}$ and radius $r_{m}$ with a flat tip, present at a uniform areal density $D_{m}$ over all epithelial surfaces (including the sides of villi and the inter-villous base). Use $l_{m} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $r_{m} = 0.050\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and $D_{m} = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. As for villi, account for footprint replacement of the underlying apical membrane.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from geometric first principles and core definitions (area of a cylinder’s lateral surface and additive surface contributions), derive a multiplicative expression for the total mucosal surface area $A_{\\text{total}}$ in terms of the smooth cylindrical area $A_{0}$ and dimensionless factors contributed by folds, villi, and microvilli. Clearly justify each factor from the stated geometry and densities.\n2. Evaluate numerically the ratio $F \\equiv A_{\\text{total}}/A_{0}$ using the given dimensions. Round your final ratio to three significant figures and report it as a pure number (no units).\n3. Separately, estimate the absolute small intestinal surface area $A_{\\text{total}}$ using your result for $F$ and express this estimate in $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, rounded to three significant figures. This estimate is for explanatory completeness only; your final reported answer must be the dimensionless ratio $F$.\n\nUse only the given dimensions and physical units, and base your derivation on geometric reasoning without invoking pre-memorized fold-increase factors. For the final answer, provide only the ratio $F$ rounded to three significant figures and with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an estimation of the total surface area amplification in the human small intestine, derived from first principles using a hierarchical geometric model. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided. We begin by defining the surface area at each level of structural complexity.\n\nLet $A_0$ be the surface area of the small intestine modeled as a simple, smooth-walled cylinder. With an inner length $L$ and inner diameter $d$, the radius is $R = d/2$. The surface area is the lateral area of the cylinder:\n$$A_0 = (\\text{circumference}) \\times (\\text{length}) = (2\\pi R)L = \\pi d L$$\n\nNext, we calculate the area increase from each of the three mucosal specializations: folds of Kerckring, villi, and microvilli. The total surface area $A_{\\text{total}}$ can be expressed as a product of the base area $A_0$ and a series of multiplicative factors:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = A_0 \\cdot F_{\\text{folds}} \\cdot F_{\\text{villi}} \\cdot F_{\\text{microvilli}}$$\nThe overall amplification factor is $F = A_{\\text{total}} / A_0 = F_{\\text{folds}} \\cdot F_{\\text{villi}} \\cdot F_{\\text{microvilli}}$.\n\n**1. Contribution of the Folds of Kerckring ($F_{\\text{folds}}$)**\nThe folds are modeled as circumferential ridges of height $h_p$ spaced by a distance $s_p$. We consider a repeating intestinal segment of length $s_p$. Without folds, the area of this segment is $A_{\\text{segment},0} = \\pi d s_p$. With a fold, the area is the sum of the basal surface area and the area of the two sides of the fold. The problem assumes negligible crest width. The area added by one fold is that of two circumferential bands of height $h_p$, which is $2 \\times (\\text{circumference}) \\times h_p = 2 (\\pi d) h_p$. The total area of the segment with the fold is:\n$$A_{\\text{segment},1} = \\pi d s_p + 2 \\pi d h_p = \\pi d (s_p + 2h_p)$$\nThe multiplicative factor due to the folds, $F_{\\text{folds}}$, is the ratio of the area with folds to the area without folds:\n$$F_{\\text{folds}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{segment},1}}{A_{\\text{segment},0}} = \\frac{\\pi d (s_p + 2h_p)}{\\pi d s_p} = 1 + \\frac{2h_p}{s_p}$$\nUsing the given values, $h_p = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $s_p = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$F_{\\text{folds}} = 1 + \\frac{2(4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{10.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 1 + 0.8 = 1.8$$\n\n**2. Contribution of the Villi ($F_{\\text{villi}}$)**\nThe villi are modeled as cylinders of height $h_v$ and radius $a$, distributed with an areal density $D_v$ over the folded surface (area $A_1 = A_0 F_{\\text{folds}}$). We consider a small patch of this folded surface with area $\\Delta A_1$.\nThe surface area of a single villus (lateral side plus flat top) is $A_{\\text{villus}} = 2\\pi a h_v + \\pi a^2$.\nEach villus occupies a footprint of area $A_{\\text{footprint}} = \\pi a^2$ on the underlying mucosa. The net area added by a single villus is the villus surface area minus the area it displaces:\n$$\\Delta A_{\\text{net, villus}} = A_{\\text{villus}} - A_{\\text{footprint}} = (2\\pi a h_v + \\pi a^2) - \\pi a^2 = 2\\pi a h_v$$\nThe total area added by all villi on the patch $\\Delta A_1$ is the number of villi ($D_v \\Delta A_1$) times the net area added per villus. The new total area of the patch, $\\Delta A_2$, is:\n$$\\Delta A_2 = \\Delta A_1 + (D_v \\Delta A_1)(2\\pi a h_v) = \\Delta A_1 (1 + 2\\pi a h_v D_v)$$\nThe multiplicative factor from the villi is therefore:\n$$F_{\\text{villi}} = \\frac{\\Delta A_2}{\\Delta A_1} = 1 + 2\\pi a h_v D_v$$\nBefore numerical evaluation, we ensure consistent units. Let's use millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). We have $h_v = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $a = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $D_v = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$. The product $a h_v D_v$ has units of $(\\mathrm{mm})(\\mathrm{mm})(\\mathrm{mm}^{-2})$, which is dimensionless, as required.\n$$F_{\\text{villi}} = 1 + 2\\pi (0.10\\,\\mathrm{mm})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm})(20\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}) = 1 + 4\\pi$$\n\n**3. Contribution of the Microvilli ($F_{\\text{microvilli}}$)**\nThe microvilli are modeled as smaller cylinders of length $l_m$ and radius $r_m$, with an areal density $D_m$. They cover all epithelial surfaces (area $A_2 = A_1 F_{\\text{villi}}$). The logic is identical to that for the villi.\nThe net area added per microvillus is the lateral surface area, as its top surface replaces the footprint area:\n$$\\Delta A_{\\text{net, microvillus}} = (2\\pi r_m l_m + \\pi r_m^2) - \\pi r_m^2 = 2\\pi r_m l_m$$\nThe multiplicative factor is:\n$$F_{\\text{microvilli}} = 1 + 2\\pi r_m l_m D_m$$\nWe must convert the units for microvilli parameters to be consistent. We are given $l_m = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $r_m = 0.050\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and $D_m = 30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. To convert $D_m$ to $\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$:\n$$D_m = 30 \\frac{1}{(\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2} = 30 \\frac{1}{(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2} = 30 \\frac{1}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2} = 30 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2} = 3.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2}$$\nThe product $r_m l_m D_m$ is dimensionless: $(\\mathrm{mm})(\\mathrm{mm})(\\mathrm{mm}^{-2})$.\n$$F_{\\text{microvilli}} = 1 + 2\\pi (5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{mm})(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm})(3.0 \\times 10^7\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-2})$$\n$$F_{\\text{microvilli}} = 1 + 2\\pi (5 \\times 1 \\times 3.0) \\times 10^{(-5 - 3 + 7)} = 1 + 30\\pi \\times 10^{-1} = 1 + 3\\pi$$\n\n**4. Total Amplification Factor and Numerical Evaluation**\nThe total amplification factor $F$ is the product of the individual factors:\n$$F = F_{\\text{folds}} \\cdot F_{\\text{villi}} \\cdot F_{\\text{microvilli}} = \\left(1 + \\frac{2h_p}{s_p}\\right) (1 + 2\\pi a h_v D_v) (1 + 2\\pi r_m l_m D_m)$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$F = (1.8) \\times (1 + 4\\pi) \\times (1 + 3\\pi)$$\nNow we evaluate this numerically:\n$$F \\approx (1.8) \\times (1 + 4 \\times 3.14159265) \\times (1 + 3 \\times 3.14159265)$$\n$$F \\approx (1.8) \\times (1 + 12.56637) \\times (1 + 9.42478)$$\n$$F \\approx (1.8) \\times (13.56637) \\times (10.42478)$$\n$$F \\approx 254.5835$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, gives $F \\approx 255$.\n\n**5. Estimate of Absolute Surface Area (for completeness)**\nThe problem asks for an estimate of the absolute surface area $A_{\\text{total}}$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$. First, we compute the base area $A_0$ in SI units.\n$L = 5.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $d = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.030\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$A_0 = \\pi d L = \\pi (0.030\\,\\mathrm{m})(5.5\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.165\\pi\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 0.5184\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe total area is then:\n$$A_{\\text{total}} = A_0 \\times F \\approx (0.5184\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times (254.5835) \\approx 131.965\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the absolute small intestinal surface area is estimated to be $132\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. However, the final answer to be reported is the dimensionless ratio $F$.\nThe final derived expression for the total mucosal surface area is $A_{\\text{total}} = A_0 \\left(1 + \\frac{2 h_p}{s_p}\\right) (1 + 2\\pi a h_v D_v) (1 + 2\\pi r_m l_m D_m)$. The evaluated ratio $F = A_{\\text{total}}/A_{0}$ is approximately $255$.",

            "problem": "A patient presents with watery diarrhea. In the study of Gastrointestinal (GI) physiology, osmolality is defined as the total number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of solvent. In the intestinal lumen, water equilibrates rapidly across the epithelium, so stool water osmolality approximates plasma osmolality. Assume plasma osmolality is $290$ milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg). A stool electrolyte analysis for this patient reports stool sodium concentration $[Na^{+}] = 110$ millimoles per liter (mmol/L) and stool potassium concentration $[K^{+}] = 30$ mmol/L. \n\nStarting from the definitions above and the principle of electroneutrality (each cation in solution is accompanied by an anion, contributing two particles to osmolality per cation-anion pair), derive an expression for the stool osmotic gap in terms of stool water osmolality and the measured stool cation concentrations.

            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Stool water osmolality approximates plasma osmolality.\n- Plasma osmolality is $290$ mOsm/kg.\n- Stool sodium concentration, $[Na^{+}]$, is $110$ mmol/L.\n- Stool potassium concentration, $[K^{+}]$, is $30$ mmol/L.\n- Principle of electroneutrality: each cation in solution is accompanied by an anion, contributing two particles to osmolality per cation-anion pair.\n- Task 1: Derive an expression for the stool osmotic gap.\n- Task 2: Compute the numeric value of the stool osmotic gap.\n- Task 3: Classify the diarrhea using the following cutoffs:\n  - Stool osmotic gap $< 50$ mOsm/kg indicates secretory diarrhea.\n  - Stool osmotic gap $> 100$ mOsm/kg indicates osmotic diarrhea.\n  - Values between $50$ mOsm/kg and $100$ mOsm/kg are indeterminate.\n- The final numeric answer must be rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of gastrointestinal physiology, specifically the concepts of osmolality, electrolyte balance, and the diagnostic use of the stool osmotic gap.

The assumption that the concentration in millimoles per liter (mmol/L) is numerically equivalent to the osmolality contribution in milliosmoles per kilogram (mOsm/kg) is a standard and acceptable approximation for dilute aqueous solutions like stool water, where the density of the solvent (water) is approximately $1$ kg/L. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe stool osmotic gap, which we denote as $G_{osm}$, represents the concentration of unmeasured, osmotically active substances in the stool. It is calculated as the difference between the total measured stool osmolality ($O_{total}$) and the osmolality contributed by the measured electrolytes ($O_{electrolytes}$).\n\n$$G_{osm} = O_{total} - O_{electrolytes}$$\n\nThe problem states that stool water osmolality rapidly equilibrates with plasma osmolality. Therefore, the total stool osmolality can be approximated by the given plasma osmolality.\n$$O_{total} \\approx 290 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the osmolality contributed by the measured electrolytes. The principal measured cations in stool are sodium ($Na^{+}$) and potassium ($K^{+}$). The problem states, based on the principle of electroneutrality, that these cations are accompanied by anions. For the purpose of calculating the electrolyte contribution to osmolality, it is assumed that the major cations ($Na^{+}$ and $K^{+}$) are balanced by anions, and each cation-anion pair contributes two osmotically active particles. Therefore, the osmolality accounted for by these measured electrolytes is approximately twice the sum of their concentrations.\n\n$$O_{electrolytes} = 2 \\times ([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}])$$\n\nHere, we use the standard clinical convention that for dilute aqueous solutions, a concentration in mmol/L is numerically equivalent to a contribution in mOsm/kg.\n\nCombining these components, we derive the expression for the stool osmotic gap:\n$$G_{osm} = O_{total} - 2 \\times ([Na^{+}] + [K^{+}])$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the provided numerical values into this expression to compute the stool osmotic gap for the patient.\nGiven:\n- $O_{total} = 290 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$\n- $[Na^{+}] = 110 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n- $[K^{+}] = 30 \\text{ mmol/L}$\n\n$$G_{osm} = 290 - 2 \\times (110 + 30)$$\n$$G_{osm} = 290 - 2 \\times (140)$$\n$$G_{osm} = 290 - 280$$\n$$G_{osm} = 10 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $10$ mOsm/kg, when expressed to three significant figures, is $10.0$ mOsm/kg.\n\nFinally, we classify the type of diarrhea using the given cutoffs. The calculated stool osmotic gap is $G_{osm} = 10.0$ mOsm/kg. According to the criteria:\n- A value less than $50$ mOsm/kg indicates secretory diarrhea.\n- A value greater than $100$ mOsm/kg indicates osmotic diarrhea.\n\nSince $10.0 < 50$, the patient's condition is classified as secretory diarrhea. This type of diarrhea is characterized by excessive mucosal secretion of fluid and electrolytes, resulting in a low osmotic gap because the stool osmolality is primarily accounted for by the high concentration of electrolytes.",
