This nourishment, delivered via coronary arteries, occurs almost exclusively during diastole, the heart's relaxation phase.

            "problem": "A healthy adult at rest has a heart rate (HR) of $75$ beats per minute. At this resting state, the measured duration of left ventricular systole (isovolumetric contraction plus ejection) is $0.30$ seconds per beat. During moderate-to-vigorous exercise, the HR rises to $150$ beats per minute. For this individual, physiologic measurements across this range show that the duration of left ventricular systole decreases by a fraction of $0.20$ relative to its resting value at the higher heart rate. Assume that left ventricular coronary perfusion occurs only during diastole and that the right ventricular contribution to coronary flow can be ignored for this calculation.\n\nUsing only the following fundamental definitions and facts:\n- Heart rate (HR) is the number of cardiac cycles per minute, so the duration of a single cardiac cycle is $60/\\text{HR}$ seconds.\n- The cardiac cycle is the sum of systole and diastole for each beat.\n- Left ventricular coronary perfusion time per beat is confined to diastole.\n\nCompute the total diastolic time available for left ventricular coronary perfusion in one minute at the higher heart rate.

Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in fundamental principles of cardiovascular physiology, and the provided values are realistic for a healthy adult. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation:**\nThe objective is to compute the total time available for left ventricular coronary perfusion in one minute during moderate-to-vigorous exercise. Based on the problem's premise, this is equivalent to calculating the total diastolic time in one minute at the exercise heart rate.\n\nLet $T_{diastole, total}$ be the total diastolic time in one minute. This can be calculated by multiplying the duration of diastole per beat by the number of beats per minute (the heart rate).\n$$ T_{diastole, total} = T_{diastole, exercise} \\times HR_{exercise} $$\nTo find $T_{diastole, total}$, we must first determine the duration of diastole per beat during exercise, $T_{diastole, exercise}$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the duration of the cardiac cycle during exercise ($T_{cycle, exercise}$).**\nUsing the provided definition, the duration of one full cardiac cycle is the reciprocal of the heart rate in Hz, or $60$ seconds divided by the heart rate in beats per minute.\n$$ T_{cycle, exercise} = \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{HR_{exercise}} $$\nGiven $HR_{exercise} = 150$ beats/min:\n$$ T_{cycle, exercise} = \\frac{60}{150} \\text{ s/beat} = 0.4 \\text{ s/beat} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the duration of systole during exercise ($T_{systole, exercise}$).**\nThe problem states that the duration of systole decreases by a fraction of $0.20$ relative to its resting value of $T_{systole, rest} = 0.30$ s.\nThe decrease in duration is:\n$$ \\Delta T_{systole} = 0.20 \\times T_{systole, rest} = 0.20 \\times 0.30 \\text{ s} = 0.06 \\text{ s} $$\nThe new systolic duration is the resting duration minus this decrease:\n$$ T_{systole, exercise} = T_{systole, rest} - \\Delta T_{systole} = 0.30 \\text{ s} - 0.06 \\text{ s} = 0.24 \\text{ s} $$\nAlternatively, this can be calculated as:\n$$ T_{systole, exercise} = T_{systole, rest} \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.30 \\text{ s} \\times 0.80 = 0.24 \\text{ s} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the duration of diastole per beat during exercise ($T_{diastole, exercise}$).**\nThe cardiac cycle is the sum of systole and diastole. Therefore, the duration of diastole is the cardiac cycle duration minus the systolic duration.\n$$ T_{diastole, exercise} = T_{cycle, exercise} - T_{systole, exercise} $$\nSubstituting the values calculated in the previous steps:\n$$ T_{diastole, exercise} = 0.4 \\text{ s} - 0.24 \\text{ s} = 0.16 \\text{ s} $$\nThis is the time available for coronary perfusion during a single heartbeat at the exercise heart rate.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total diastolic time in one minute during exercise ($T_{diastole, total}$).**\nTo find the total time in one minute, we multiply the diastolic time per beat by the number of beats in that minute ($HR_{exercise}$).\n$$ T_{diastole, total} = T_{diastole, exercise} \\times HR_{exercise} $$\n$$ T_{diastole, total} = (0.16 \\text{ s/beat}) \\times (150 \\text{ beats/min}) = 24 \\text{ s/min} $$\nThus, the total time available for left ventricular coronary perfusion in one minute is $24$ seconds.\n\n**Step 5: Final Answer Formatting.**\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in seconds and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $24$ seconds. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $24.0$.",

This practice introduces the classic Windkessel model, a powerful analogy that treats the elastic arteries as a pressure reservoir that smooths blood flow. By working from first principles of fluid dynamics, you will derive and calculate key hemodynamic parameters, gaining a deep understanding of how arterial compliance ($C$) and peripheral resistance ($R$) shape the blood pressure waveform .",

            "problem": "A healthy adult is modeled using a lumped-parameter arterial system in which the large elastic arteries behave as a single compliant compartment that receives pulsatile inflow from the left ventricle and discharges through a single downstream resistance to a venous reservoir at negligible pressure. Assume linear compliance and laminar flow, with constant resistance and compliance over the cardiac cycle.\n\nThe heart rate is $75$ beats per minute, giving a cardiac period $T$ in seconds.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated by first extracting the givens and then assessing its scientific grounding, consistency, and structure.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Heart rate: $75$ beats per minute\n- Cardiac period: $T$ seconds\n- Stroke volume, $V_{stroke}$: $70$ mL\n- Systolic ejection time, $T_s$: $0.30$ s\n- Inflow during systole: constant flow\n- Inflow during diastole: zero\n- Total peripheral resistance, $R$: $1.10$ mmHg·s/mL\n- Large-artery compliance, $C$: $1.60$ mL/mmHg\n- Model: Two-element Windkessel ($R$ and $C$)\n- Venous pressure: approximated as zero\n- Required output: steady-periodic end-systolic arterial pressure, numerical value in mmHg, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The two-element Windkessel model is a classical and fundamental simplification used in cardiovascular fluid dynamics to describe the behavior of the arterial system. The provided physiological parameters (heart rate, stroke volume, resistance, compliance) are within the normal range for a healthy adult, making the setup realistic. The problem is well-posed: it provides all necessary data and a clear objective, leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on the principle of conservation of volume in the compliant arterial compartment. The rate of change of volume stored in the compliance, $dV/dt$, is equal to the rate of blood flow into the compartment, $Q_{in}(t)$, minus the rate of blood flow out of it, $Q_{out}(t)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = Q_{in}(t) - Q_{out}(t)\n$$\nThe system is modeled with a linear compliance $C$ and a linear resistance $R$. The constitutive relations are:\n1.  Volume stored in the compliance, $V(t)$, is related to the arterial pressure $P(t)$ by $V(t) = C \\cdot P(t)$. Differentiating with respect to time gives $\\frac{dV}{dt} = C \\frac{dP}{dt}$, assuming $C$ is constant.\n2.  Outflow through the resistance, $Q_{out}(t)$, is governed by Ohm's law, $Q_{out}(t) = \\frac{P(t) - P_{venous}}{R}$. Given that the venous pressure is approximated as zero, this simplifies to $Q_{out}(t) = \\frac{P(t)}{R}$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the conservation equation yields the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for arterial pressure $P(t)$:\n$$\nC \\frac{dP}{dt} = Q_{in}(t) - \\frac{P(t)}{R}\n$$\nRearranging this equation into standard form gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + \\frac{1}{RC}P(t) = \\frac{1}{C}Q_{in}(t)\n$$\nWe define the time constant of the arterial system as $\\tau = RC$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}P(t) = \\frac{1}{C}Q_{in}(t)\n$$\n\nThe cardiac cycle is divided into two phases: systole and diastole.\n\nFirst, we calculate the cardiac period $T$ from the heart rate of $75$ beats per minute:\n$$\nT = \\frac{60 \\text{ s/min}}{75 \\text{ beats/min}} = 0.8 \\text{ s}\n$$\n\n**1. Systole ($0 \\le t \\le T_s$):**\nDuring systole, the left ventricle ejects the stroke volume $V_{stroke} = 70$ mL over the systolic time $T_s = 0.30$ s. The inflow is modeled as a constant rate $Q_s$.\n$$\nQ_s = \\frac{V_{stroke}}{T_s} = \\frac{70 \\text{ mL}}{0.30 \\text{ s}} = \\frac{700}{3} \\text{ mL/s}\n$$\nThe governing differential equation during systole is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}P(t) = \\frac{Q_s}{C}\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of a homogeneous solution and a particular solution: $P_{sys}(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau) + R Q_s$. Let $P(0) = P_d$ be the diastolic pressure (the pressure at the start of systole).\n$$\nP_d = A \\exp(0) + R Q_s \\implies A = P_d - R Q_s\n$$\nThus, the pressure during systole is:\n$$\nP_{sys}(t) = R Q_s + (P_d - R Q_s) \\exp(-t/\\tau)\n$$\nThe end-systolic pressure, $P_s$, is the pressure at $t = T_s$.\n$$\nP_s = P_{sys}(T_s) = R Q_s + (P_d - R Q_s) \\exp(-T_s/\\tau) \\quad (*_1)\n$$\n\n**2. Diastole ($T_s < t \\le T$):**\nDuring diastole, there is no inflow from the ventricle, so $Q_{in}(t) = 0$. The duration of diastole is $T_d = T - T_s = 0.8 \\text{ s} - 0.30 \\text{ s} = 0.5 \\text{ s}$.\nThe governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}P(t) = 0\n$$\nTo solve this, let's define a new time variable $t' = t - T_s$, which runs from $0$ to $T_d$. The solution is of the form $P_{dias}(t') = B \\exp(-t'/\\tau)$. The initial condition for diastole is the pressure at its beginning, which is the end-systolic pressure $P_s$. So, $P_{dias}(0) = P_s$.\n$$\nP_s = B \\exp(0) \\implies B = P_s\n$$\nThe pressure during diastole is:\n$$\nP_{dias}(t') = P_s \\exp(-t'/\\tau)\n$$\n\n**3. Steady-Periodic Condition:**\nThe problem specifies a steady-periodic state, which means the pressure at the end of the cardiac cycle is equal to the pressure at the beginning of the next cycle. The pressure at the end of diastole ($t'=T_d$) must be equal to the diastolic pressure $P_d$.\n$$\nP_d = P_{dias}(T_d) = P_s \\exp(-T_d/\\tau) \\quad (*_2)\n$$\n\n**4. Solving for End-Systolic Pressure $P_s$:**\nWe now have a system of two linear equations ($*_1$ and $*_2$) for the two unknowns $P_s$ and $P_d$. We can solve for $P_s$. Substitute the expression for $P_d$ from ($*_2$) into ($*_1$):\n$$\nP_s = R Q_s + (P_s \\exp(-T_d/\\tau) - R Q_s) \\exp(-T_s/\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nP_s = R Q_s + P_s \\exp(-T_d/\\tau) \\exp(-T_s/\\tau) - R Q_s \\exp(-T_s/\\tau)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$ and noting that $T_d + T_s = T$:\n$$\nP_s = R Q_s + P_s \\exp(-T/\\tau) - R Q_s \\exp(-T_s/\\tau)\n$$\nNow, we group terms with $P_s$:\n$$\nP_s - P_s \\exp(-T/\\tau) = R Q_s - R Q_s \\exp(-T_s/\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nP_s (1 - \\exp(-T/\\tau)) = R Q_s (1 - \\exp(-T_s/\\tau))\n$$\nIsolating $P_s$ gives the final analytical expression for the end-systolic pressure:\n$$\nP_s = R Q_s \\frac{1 - \\exp(-T_s/\\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-T/\\tau)}\n$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation:**\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\n- $R = 1.10$ mmHg·s/mL\n- $C = 1.60$ mL/mmHg\n- $T = 0.8$ s\n- $T_s = 0.30$ s\n- $Q_s = \\frac{70}{0.30} = \\frac{700}{3}$ mL/s\n\nFirst, calculate the time constant $\\tau$ and the product $R Q_s$:\n$$\n\\tau = RC = (1.10 \\text{ mmHg·s/mL}) (1.60 \\text{ mL/mmHg}) = 1.76 \\text{ s}\n$$\n$$\nR Q_s = (1.10 \\text{ mmHg·s/mL}) \\left(\\frac{700}{3} \\text{ mL/s}\\right) = \\frac{770}{3} \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\nNow, calculate the exponents:\n$$\n-\\frac{T_s}{\\tau} = -\\frac{0.30}{1.76} = -\\frac{15}{88}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{T}{\\tau} = -\\frac{0.8}{1.76} = -\\frac{5}{11}\n$$\nSubstitute these into the expression for $P_s$:\n$$\nP_s = \\frac{770}{3} \\times \\frac{1 - \\exp(-15/88)}{1 - \\exp(-5/11)}\n$$\n$$\nP_s \\approx 256.6667 \\times \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.1704545)}{1 - \\exp(-0.4545454)}\n$$\n$$\nP_s \\approx 256.6667 \\times \\frac{1 - 0.8432853}{1 - 0.6347341}\n$$\n$$\nP_s \\approx 256.6667 \\times \\frac{0.1567147}{0.3652659}\n$$\n$$\nP_s \\approx 256.6667 \\times 0.4290403\n$$\n$$\nP_s \\approx 110.12306 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nP_s = 110.1 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$",

The model is based on established physiological principles (Ohm's law for hemodynamics, baroreflex control). There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Steady-State Condition\n\nThe problem requires deriving a scalar steady-state condition for the mean arterial pressure, $P$. The system is governed by the interaction between the heart and the systemic vasculature, described by the hemodynamic Ohm's law:\n$$P = Q \\cdot R$$\nwhere $P$ is the mean arterial pressure in $\\text{mmHg}$, $Q$ is the cardiac output in $\\text{L}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$, and $R$ is the total peripheral resistance (TPR) in $\\text{mmHg}\\cdot\\text{min}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nCardiac output, $Q$, is defined as the product of heart rate, $\\text{HR}$ (in $\\text{beats}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$), and stroke volume, $\\text{SV}$ (in $\\text{L}\\,\\text{beat}^{-1}$):\n$$Q = \\text{HR} \\cdot \\text{SV}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $Q$ into Ohm's law provides the core equation for the system's state:\n$$P = \\left(\\text{HR} \\cdot \\text{SV}\\right) \\cdot R$$\n\nIn this closed-loop model, the effector variables $\\text{HR}$, $\\text{SV}$, and $R$ are not independent constants but are themselves functions of the mean arterial pressure $P$, mediated by the baroreflex. This feedback is what allows the system to maintain homeostasis. The problem provides the following static, linear control relationships, which are clipped to physiological limits:\n\n1.  **Heart Rate:** The baroreflex adjusts $\\text{HR}$ in response to deviations of $P$ from the setpoint $P_{\\text{set}}$.\n    $$\\text{HR}(P) = \\mathrm{clip}\\!\\left(\\text{HR}_{0} + k_{\\text{hr}}\\left(P_{\\text{set}} - P\\right),\\, \\text{HR}_{\\min},\\, \\text{HR}_{\\max}\\right)$$\n\n2.  **Stroke Volume:** Stroke volume is similarly controlled by the baroreflex, and is also affected by the relative circulating blood volume $V_{\\text{rel}}$.\n    $$\\text{SV}(P, V_{\\text{rel}}) = \\mathrm{clip}\\!\\left(\\text{SV}_{0} + k_{\\text{sv}}\\left(P_{\\text{set}} - P\\right) + k_{v}\\left(V_{\\text{rel}} - 1\\right),\\, \\text{SV}_{\\min},\\, \\text{SV}_{\\max}\\right)$$\n\n3.  **Total Peripheral Resistance:** Resistance is controlled by the baroreflex and can be altered by an exogenous factor $\\Delta R_{\\text{exo}}$.\n    $$R(P, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}}) = \\mathrm{clip}\\!\\left(R_{0} + \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}} + k_{R}\\left(P_{\\text{set}} - P\\right),\\, R_{\\min},\\, R_{\\max}\\right)$$\n\nThe system is in a steady state when the pressure $P$ satisfies the core equation where $\\text{HR}$, $\\text{SV}$, and $R$ are determined by that same pressure $P$ and the given external perturbations $(V_{\\text{rel}}, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}})$. Substituting the functional forms of the effectors into the core equation yields the steady-state condition:\n$$P = \\text{HR}(P) \\cdot \\text{SV}(P, V_{\\text{rel}}) \\cdot R(P, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}})$$\n\nThis is a single, scalar, nonlinear equation in the unknown variable $P$. To solve this numerically, it is standard to reformulate it as a root-finding problem. We define a function $f(P)$ whose root corresponds to the steady-state pressure $P_{ss}$:\n$$f(P, V_{\\text{rel}}, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}}) = P - \\text{HR}(P) \\cdot \\text{SV}(P, V_{\\text{rel}}) \\cdot R(P, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}}) = 0$$\n\n### Justification for Numerical Solution Method\n\nThe problem can be reliably solved using a bracketing method like bisection. To justify this, we must analyze the properties of the function $f(P)$.\n\nLet's define the product of the effectors as $G(P, V_{\\text{rel}}, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}}) = \\text{HR}(P) \\cdot \\text{SV}(P, V_{\\text{rel}}) \\cdot R(P, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}})$. Then our root-finding function is $f(P) = P - G(P)$.\n\nThe baroreflex gains $k_{\\text{hr}}$, $k_{\\text{sv}}$, and $k_{R}$ are all positive. The control logic for each effector is based on the error term $(P_{\\text{set}} - P)$. This means that as $P$ increases, the arguments of the clipping functions for $\\text{HR}$, $\\text{SV}$, and $R$ all decrease. Since the clipping function is monotonic non-decreasing, the outputs $\\text{HR}(P)$, $\\text{SV}(P)$, and $R(P)$ are all non-increasing functions of $P$.\n\nThe effector values are always positive due to the specified physiological bounds. Therefore, their product, $G(P)$, is also a non-increasing function of $P$.\n\nThe function we wish to find the root of is $f(P) = P - G(P)$. Its derivative with respect to $P$ is:\n$$f'(P) = \\frac{d}{dP} \\left( P - G(P) \\right) = 1 - G'(P)$$\nSince $G(P)$ is a non-increasing function, its derivative $G'(P)$ must be less than or equal to zero everywhere it is defined (it may not be defined at the clipping points, but the function is continuous). Thus, $f'(P) = 1 - (\\text{a non-positive value}) \\geq 1$.\n\nSince $f'(P) \\ge 1$ for all $P$, $f(P)$ is a strictly increasing function of $P$. A continuous, strictly increasing function can cross the horizontal axis at most once, which guarantees that if a root exists, it is unique.\n\nTo prove existence within the given bracket $[P_{\\text{low}}, P_{\\text{high}}] = [20.0, 200.0]$, we can evaluate $f(P)$ at the endpoints.\n-   At $P = 20.0\\,\\text{mmHg}$, the error term $(P_{\\text{set}} - P) = (93.0 - 20.0) = 73.0$ is large and positive. The baroreflex will be maximally engaged to raise pressure. The effectors will be at or near their maximum clipped values ($\\text{HR}_{\\max}=180$, $\\text{SV}_{\\max}=0.12$, $R_{\\max}=30.0$). The product $G(20)$ will be large, specifically $G(20) \\ge \\text{HR}_{\\min}\\cdot\\text{SV}_{\\min}\\cdot R_{\\min} = 40 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 8.0 = 9.6$. A more realistic estimate using the max values gives a very large number, so $f(20) = 20 - G(20)$ will almost certainly be negative.\n-   At $P = 200.0\\,\\text{mmHg}$, the error term $(P_{\\text{set}} - P) = (93.0 - 200.0) = -107.0$ is large and negative. The reflex will be maximally engaged to lower pressure. The effectors will be at their minimum clipped values ($\\text{HR}_{\\min}=40$, $\\text{SV}_{\\min}=0.03$, $R_{\\min}=8.0$). The product is $G(200) = 40 \\cdot 0.03 \\cdot 8.0 = 9.6$. So, $f(200) = 200 - G(200) = 200 - 9.6 = 190.4$, which is positive.\n\nSince $f(P)$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and $f(20)  0$ and $f(200)  0$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees the existence of a unique root within the interval $[20.0, 200.0]$. A bisection method is therefore a robust and appropriate choice for finding this root.\n\nThe numerical implementation will consist of:\n1.  Defining the functions for $\\text{HR}(P)$, $\\text{SV}(P, V_{\\text{rel}})$, and $R(P, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}})$ including the clipping mechanism.\n2.  Defining the objective function $f(P, V_{\\text{rel}}, \\Delta R_{\\text{exo}})$.\n3.  Implementing a bisection algorithm that iteratively narrows the bracket $[P_{\\text{low}}, P_{\\text{high}}]$ until the width of the interval is less than the specified tolerance of $10^{-6}$.\n4.
