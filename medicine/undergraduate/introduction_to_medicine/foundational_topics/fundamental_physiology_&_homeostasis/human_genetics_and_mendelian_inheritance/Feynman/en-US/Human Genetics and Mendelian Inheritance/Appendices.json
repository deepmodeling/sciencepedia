This practice is a foundational exercise in deriving the expected outcomes of a dihybrid cross from first principles. By first confirming the classic $9:3:3:1$ ratio under independent assortment and then deriving how these proportions change with genetic linkage, you will build a robust quantitative understanding of the relationship between recombination frequency ($\\theta$) and phenotypic ratios .",

            "problem": "A clinician-geneticist is explaining classical dihybrid crosses to medical students in the context of autosomal traits with complete dominance. Two pure-breeding lines are crossed: one is homozygous dominant at both loci with genotype $AABB$ and the other is homozygous recessive at both loci with genotype $aabb$. Both loci are autosomal, each dominant allele ($A$ or $B$) is completely dominant over its recessive counterpart ($a$ or $b$), there is no selection, and meioses are fair. The cross produces the first filial generation (F1), which is then self-fertilized to produce the second filial generation (F2). Assume the F1 is in coupling phase, so its haplotypes are $AB/ab$.\n\nStarting only from the law of segregation, the law of independent assortment, and the definition of the recombination fraction $\\theta$ as the probability that a gamete from a doubly heterozygous individual is recombinant at the two loci, do the following:\n\n1) Under independent assortment (effectively unlinked loci, which corresponds to $\\theta = 0.5$ by definition), derive the expected F2 phenotypic proportions for the four phenotypic classes $A{-}B{-}$, $A{-}bb$, $aaB{-}$, and $aabb$, and thereby show the classical $9:3:3:1$ proportion.\n\n2) Now suppose the loci are linked in the F1 with recombination fraction $\\theta$ satisfying $0 \\le \\theta  0.5$. Derive from first principles the closed-form expressions for the expected F2 phenotypic proportions as functions of $\\theta$ for the same four phenotypic classes, in the order $A{-}B{-}$, $A{-}bb$, $aaB{-}$, $aabb$. Express your final answer as a single row matrix. Do not round; provide exact algebraic expressions.",
            "solution": "The problem statement presents a standard exercise in Mendelian genetics concerning a dihybrid cross, first under the assumption of independent assortment and then with genetic linkage. All terms are clearly defined, the initial conditions are specified, and the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem for which a rigorous derivation can be performed.\n\nLet the alleles at the two autosomal loci be denoted by $A$ and $a$, and $B$ and $b$. The parental cross is between two pure-breeding lines, $AABB \\times aabb$. The $AABB$ parent produces only $AB$ gametes, and the $aabb$ parent produces only $ab$ gametes. Therefore, the first filial (F1) generation consists entirely of individuals with the genotype $AaBb$. The problem correctly states that these individuals are in coupling phase, meaning their parental haplotypes are $AB$ and $ab$, which can be represented as $AB/ab$. The F1 individuals are then self-fertilized ($AaBb \\times AaBb$) to produce the second filial (F2) generation.\n\n**1) Independent Assortment ($\\theta = 0.5$)**\n\nUnder the law of independent assortment, the segregation of alleles at the $A$ locus is independent of the segregation of alleles at the $B$ locus. For a heterozygous individual $AaBb$, the law of segregation implies that gametes will contain allele $A$ with probability $1/2$ and allele $a$ with probability $1/2$. Similarly, gametes will contain allele $B$ with probability $1/2$ and allele $b$ with probability $1/2$.\n\nThe frequencies of the four possible gamete types are found by multiplying the probabilities of the constituent alleles:\n-   Frequency of $AB$ gamete: $P(AB) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Frequency of $Ab$ gamete: $P(Ab) = P(A) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Frequency of $aB$ gamete: $P(aB) = P(a) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Frequency of $ab$ gamete: $P(ab) = P(a) \\times P(b) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe parental gamete types for the $AB/ab$ heterozygote are $AB$ and $ab$. The recombinant gamete types are $Ab$ and $aB$. The recombination fraction $\\theta$ is the total frequency of recombinant gametes, which is $P(Ab) + P(aB) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 = 0.5$. This confirms that independent assortment corresponds to $\\theta = 0.5$.\n\nTo find the F2 phenotypic proportions, we can consider each locus independently. For a monohybrid cross $Aa \\times Aa$, the genotypic proportions are $1/4 AA$, $1/2 Aa$, and $1/4 aa$. Due to complete dominance, the phenotypic proportions are:\n-   $P(A{-}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$\n-   $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\nSimilarly, for the cross $Bb \\times Bb$:\n-   $P(B{-}) = \\frac{3}{4}$\n-   $P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSince the loci assort independently, we multiply these probabilities to find the F2 dihybrid phenotypic proportions:\n-   $P(A{-}B{-}) = P(A{-}) \\times P(B{-}) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$\n-   $P(A{-}bb) = P(A{-}) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n-   $P(aaB{-}) = P(aa) \\times P(B{-}) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$\n-   $P(aabb) = P(aa) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$\nThese proportions $9/16 : 3/16 : 3/16 : 1/16$ correspond to the classical $9:3:3:1$ phenotypic ratio.\n\n**2) Linked Loci ($0 \\le \\theta  0.5$)**\n\nWhen the loci are linked, the law of independent assortment does not apply. We must derive the gamete frequencies from the definition of the recombination fraction $\\theta$, which is the probability that a gamete is recombinant. The F1 individual is $AaBb$ in coupling phase ($AB/ab$).\n\n-   The parental gametes are $AB$ and $ab$. The total probability of producing a parental gamete is $1 - \\theta$. Since meiosis is fair, these are produced in equal frequencies:\n    $P(AB) = P(ab) = \\frac{1-\\theta}{2}$\n-   The recombinant gametes are $Ab$ and $aB$. The total probability of producing a recombinant gamete is $\\theta$. These are also produced in equal frequencies:\n    $P(Ab) = P(aB) = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$\n\nThe F2 generation is formed by the random fusion of these gametes during self-fertilization. We calculate the probability of each phenotype by summing the probabilities of the genotypes that produce it.\n\n-   **Phenotype $aabb$**: This phenotype corresponds to a single genotype, $aabb$. It is formed by the fusion of two $ab$ gametes.\n    $P(aabb) = P(ab) \\times P(ab) = \\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}$.\n\n-   **Phenotype $A{-}bb$**: This phenotype arises from genotypes $AAbb$ and $Aabb$.\n    $P(AAbb) = P(Ab) \\times P(Ab) = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}$.\n    $P(Aabb) = P(Ab) \\times P(ab) + P(ab) \\times P(Ab) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4}$.\n    Summing these gives: $P(A{-}bb) = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4} = \\frac{\\theta^2 + 2\\theta - 2\\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$.\n\n-   **Phenotype $aaB{-}$**: This phenotype arises from genotypes $aaBB$ and $aaBb$.\n    $P(aaBB) = P(aB) \\times P(aB) = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4}$.\n    $P(aaBb) = P(aB) \\times P(ab) + P(ab) \\times P(aB) = 2\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1-\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4}$.\n    Summing these gives: $P(aaB{-}) = \\frac{\\theta^2}{4} + \\frac{2\\theta(1-\\theta)}{4} = \\frac{\\theta^2 + 2\\theta - 2\\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$.\n\n-   **Phenotype $A{-}B{-}$**: The probabilities of all four mutually exclusive phenotypes must sum to $1$. We can find an expression for $P(A{-}B{-})$ by subtraction:\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = 1 - P(A{-}bb) - P(aaB{-}) - P(aabb)$.\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}\\right)$.\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{4 - (2\\theta - \\theta^2) - (2\\theta - \\theta^2) - (1 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2)}{4}$.\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{4 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2 - 1 + 2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$.\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{(4-1) + (-2\\theta - 2\\theta + 2\\theta) + (\\theta^2 + \\theta^2 - \\theta^2)}{4}$.\n    $P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{3 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4}$.\n\nThe derived phenotypic proportions for the F2 generation, expressed as functions of the recombination fraction $\\theta$, are:\n-   $P(A{-}B{-}) = \\frac{3 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4}$\n-   $P(A{-}bb) = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$\n-   $P(aaB{-}) = \\frac{2\\theta - \\theta^2}{4}$\n-   $P(aabb) = \\frac{1 - 2\\theta + \\theta^2}{4} = \\frac{(1-\\theta)^2}{4}$\n\nThese expressions are the required closed-form solutions.",

            "problem": "A multigenerational family presents with a history of hereditary sensorineural hearing loss consistent with autosomal dominant segregation. Prior population-based studies of this specific familial form estimate a penetrance of $p = 0.7$ for carriers of the causal allele.

            "solution": "The user wants me to validate and solve a problem in medical genetics.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Condition:** Hereditary sensorineural hearing loss.\n*   **Inheritance Pattern:** Autosomal dominant segregation.\n*   **Penetrance ($p$):** The probability that a carrier of the causal allele expresses the phenotype is estimated to be $p = 0.7$.\n*   **Proband:** An individual with moderate-to-severe hearing loss, who is part of the affected family.\n*   **Proband's History:** Received high-dose aminoglycosides for a severe infection, after which hearing loss developed.\n*   **Proband's Spouse:** Healthy and unrelated to the family.\n*   **Offspring:** The proband and spouse have $8$ children, all with normal hearing by age $25$.\n*   **Available Data:** No molecular genotyping is available.\n*   **Core Concepts:** Autosomal dominant transmission, penetrance, phenocopy (defined as a phenotype in a non-carrier due to environmental exposure).\n*   **Question:** Which of the provided single observations most strongly supports the conclusion that the proband's hearing loss is a phenocopy rather than an expression of the familial dominant allele?\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of Mendelian genetics, including autosomal dominant inheritance, incomplete penetrance, and phenocopy. The specific example of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity is a well-documented medical phenomenon that can mimic genetic deafness, making it a classic example of a phenocopy. The entire setup is scientifically sound.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The question asks for the observation that provides the *strongest* support for one hypothesis over another. This requires a comparative evaluation of the evidence provided by each option, a standard task in scientific and clinical reasoning. The problem is well-posed as it guides the solver to find the most compelling piece of evidence among the choices.\n*   **Objective:** The problem statement is written in precise, objective, and clinical language. It is free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions or missing pieces of information that would prevent a rigorous analysis. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to evaluate which observation most strongly supports one of two competing hypotheses for the proband's hearing loss.\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Genetic Expression ($H_G$)**\nThe proband carries the familial autosomal dominant allele (genotype, say, $Aa$) and the hearing loss is a result of this allele being expressed (i.e., penetrant). The aminoglycoside exposure is coincidental.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Phenocopy ($H_P$)**\nThe proband does not carry the familial allele (genotype $aa$). The hearing loss is a phenocopy, caused entirely by the environmental exposure to aminoglycosides.\n\nThe observation that \"most strongly supports\" $H_P$ is the one that is least likely to have occurred if $H_G$ were true. We will analyze each option by calculating or estimating the probability of observing it, given that $H_G$ is true. A very low probability would cast significant doubt on $H_G$ and thus provide strong support for the alternative, $H_P$.\n\n**Option A: Observing $0$ affected offspring among $8$ children of the proband with an unaffected, unrelated spouse, given an estimated penetrance $p = 0.7$ for carriers in this family.**\n\nLet's calculate the probability of this observation under $H_G$.\n1.  If the proband's hearing loss is due to the familial allele ($H_G$), their genotype is $Aa$.\n2.  The spouse is healthy and unrelated, so we assume their genotype is $aa$.\n3.  The probability of the proband passing the causal allele ($A$) to any child is $1/2$.\n4.  The probability that a child who inherits the allele ($A$) will be affected is the penetrance, $p = 0.7$.\n5.  Therefore, the probability that any single child is affected is the product of these probabilities: $P(\\text{child affected}) = P(\\text{inherits } A) \\times P(\\text{is affected} | \\text{has } A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 0.7 = 0.35$.\n6.  The probability that a single child is unaffected is $P(\\text{child unaffected}) = 1 - P(\\text{child affected}) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$.\n7.  Assuming each birth is an independent event, the probability of having $8$ consecutive unaffected children is:\n    $$P(\\text{Observation A} | H_G) = (0.65)^8 \\approx 0.03186$$\n    This is approximately a $3.2\\%$ probability. An event with such a low probability is surprising and constitutes strong evidence against the hypothesis ($H_G$) under which it was calculated. Under the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$), the proband's genotype is $aa$, so all children will be $aa$ and unaffected by the familial gene. The probability of having $8$ unaffected children is $1$. The large discrepancy in probabilities makes this observation strong support for $H_P$.\n\n**Verdict for Option A:** The probability of this observation under the genetic hypothesis is very low ($P \\approx 0.032$). This provides strong statistical evidence against the genetic hypothesis and, in turn, strong support for the phenocopy hypothesis. **This is a strong candidate.**\n\n**Option B: The proband’s monozygotic twin (genetically identical) did not receive aminoglycosides and has normal hearing, while the proband is affected.**\n\nLet's calculate the probability of this observation under $H_G$.\n1.  Monozygotic (MZ) twins are genetically identical. If the proband is a carrier ($Aa$) under $H_G$, the twin must also be a carrier ($Aa$).\n2.  The observation is that the proband is affected and the twin is unaffected. This is a case of phenotypic discordance.\n3.  Under $H_G$, this discordance is explained by incomplete penetrance. The aminoglycoside exposure is considered irrelevant to the cause.\n4.  The probability that the proband is affected (penetrant) is $p = 0.7$.\n5.  The probability that the twin is unaffected (non-penetrant) is $1-p = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3$.\n6.  The probability of this specific combination (proband affected, twin unaffected) occurring in an MZ twin pair of carriers is:\n    $$P(\\text{Observation B} | H_G) = p \\times (1-p) = 0.7 \\times 0.3 = 0.21$$\n    This is a $21\\%$ probability. An event with a $21\\%$ chance is not particularly rare and is quite consistent with the genetic hypothesis of incomplete penetrance. While the observation is perfectly explained by the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$), it does not strongly discredit the genetic hypothesis ($H_G$).\n\n**Verdict for Option B:** The probability of this observation under the genetic hypothesis is reasonably high ($P = 0.21$). Therefore, it provides only weak evidence against the genetic hypothesis. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: The proband’s hearing loss began at a younger age than that of other affected relatives in the family.**\n\nThis observation relates to the concept of variable expressivity, where a single genetic condition can manifest differently among individuals, including variations in the age of onset. While a significant deviation in onset age can suggest a different etiology (like a phenocopy), many dominant disorders naturally have a wide range of onset ages. Without knowing the typical range for this specific familial disorder, it is impossible to quantify how unusual this observation is. It is suggestive but is considered weak, qualitative evidence compared to the statistical evidence in A and B.\n\n**Verdict for Option C:** This provides weak, non-quantifiable evidence and is less compelling than a statistically rare outcome. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: A neighbor with no family history of hearing loss received aminoglycosides and subsequently developed hearing loss.**\n\nThis observation confirms a general medical fact: aminoglycosides can be ototoxic. This supports the biological plausibility of the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$). However, it provides no specific information about the proband. The fact that the drug can cause the phenotype in an unrelated person does not help distinguish whether the proband's phenotype is genetic or environmental. This is the weakest form of evidence, as it is external to the family being studied.\n\n**Verdict for Option D:** This provides no direct evidence pertinent to the proband's specific case. **Incorrect.**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nComparing the options, we seek the one that provides the strongest evidence for the phenocopy hypothesis ($H_P$). This corresponds to the observation that is least likely under the genetic hypothesis ($H_G$).\n-   $P(\\text{Observation A} | H_G) \\approx 0.032$ (or $3.2\\%$)\n-   $P(\\text{Observation B} | H_G) = 0.21$ (or $21\\%$)\n-   $P(\\text{Observation C} | H_G)$ is unknown but qualitatively weak.\n-   $P(\\text{Observation D} | H_G)$ is irrelevant to the proband's case.\n\nThe probability of observing $0$ affected children out of $8$ under the genetic hypothesis is much lower than the probability of observing a discordant monozygotic twin. Therefore, Observation A is a much more surprising result if the cause is genetic, and it provides the strongest statistical support for the alternative phenocopy hypothesis.",

            "problem": "A rare congenital disorder is suspected to involve either a single autosomal gene acting in a recessive manner or an interaction between two autosomal genes acting in a recessive manner.

Both parents are clinically unaffected and, based on targeted genotyping, are each heterozygous at both loci, so their genotypes are $A a B b \\times A a B b$. Assume the following two mechanistic models:\n\n- Model $M$ (monogenic recessive at $A$): An individual is affected if and only if the genotype at gene $A$ is $a a$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Mendelian genetics, is mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of a likelihood ratio comparing two models of inheritance for a rare congenital disorder, given the genotypes of the parents and the disease status of their offspring.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expected segregation ratio, which is the probability $p$ that a child is affected, under each of the two proposed models. The parental cross is given as $A a B b \\times A a B b$. The problem states to assume Mendelian segregation and independent assortment.\n\nAccording to Mendel's First Law (the Law of Segregation), for a heterozygous cross at a single locus, say $A a \\times A a$, the genotypes of the offspring will be distributed in the ratio $1:2:1$ for $A A$, $A a$, and $a a$, respectively. The probabilities are therefore:\n$P(AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$P(Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nSimilarly, for the locus $B$, the cross $B b \\times B b$ yields the following probabilities:\n$P(BB) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$P(Bb) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nAccording to Mendel's Second Law (the Law of Independent Assortment), the alleles for the two genes, $A$ and $B$, segregate independently. This allows us to calculate the probability of a two-locus genotype by multiplying the probabilities of the single-locus genotypes.\n\nUnder Model $M$ (monogenic recessive at A), an individual is affected if and only if their genotype at gene $A$ is $a a$. The genotype at gene $B$ is irrelevant. The probability of an affected child under this model, denoted $p_M$, is:\n$$p_M = P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nUnder Model $D$ (digenic recessive interaction), an individual is affected if and only if their genotype is $a a$ at gene $A$ and simultaneously $b b$ at gene $B$. The probability of an affected child under this model, denoted $p_D$, is:\n$$p_D = P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa \\text{ and } bb)$$\nDue to independent assortment, this is:\n$$p_D = P(aa) \\times P(bb) = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}$$\n\nNext, we model the number of affected offspring, $k$, in a total of $n$ births. This is a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, where the probability of \"success\" (an affected child) is $p$. The number of affected children $K$ follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$. The probability of observing exactly $k$ affected children out of $n$ is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$P(K=k \\mid n, p) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nThis probability, viewed as a function of the model parameter $p$ for fixed data $(n, k)$, is the likelihood function, $L(p \\mid k, n)$.\n\nWe are given $n=12$ total offspring and $k=3$ affected offspring.\n\nThe likelihood of the data under Model $M$ is:\n$$L(M \\mid k=3, n=12) = \\binom{12}{3} (p_M)^3 (1-p_M)^{12-3}$$\nSubstituting $p_M = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$L(M \\mid 3, 12) = \\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^9 = \\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^9$$\n\nThe likelihood of the data under Model $D$ is:\n$$L(D \\mid k=3, n=12) = \\binom{12}{3} (p_D)^3 (1-p_D)^{12-3}$$\nSubstituting $p_D = \\frac{1}{16}$:\n$$L(D \\mid 3, 12) = \\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^3 \\left(1-\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^9 = \\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\right)^9$$\n\nFinally, we compute the likelihood ratio, $LR$, in favor of Model $D$ over Model $M$:\n$$LR = \\frac{L(D \\mid k,n)}{L(M \\mid k,n)} = \\frac{\\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\right)^9}{\\binom{12}{3} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^9}$$\nThe binomial coefficient term $\\binom{12}{3}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$LR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{16}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{15}{16}\\right)^9}{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^9}$$\nWe can group terms with the same exponents:\n$$LR = \\left(\\frac{1/16}{1/4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{15/16}{3/4}\\right)^9$$\nSimplify the ratios inside the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{1/16}{1/4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = \\frac{4}{16} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$\\frac{15/16}{3/4} = \\frac{15}{16} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{60}{48} = \\frac{5 \\times 12}{4 \\times 12} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\nSubstitute these simplified ratios back into the expression for $LR$:\n$$LR = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^9 = \\frac{1^3}{4^3} \\times \\frac{5^9}{4^9} = \\frac{5^9}{4^3 \\times 4^9} = \\frac{5^9}{4^{12}}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$5^9 = 1,953,125$$\n$$4^{12} = (4^6)^2 = (4096)^2 = 16,777,216$$\nSo, the likelihood ratio is:\n$$LR = \\frac{1,953,125}{16,777,216} \\approx 0.1164165$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$LR \\approx 0.1164$$\nThis result indicates that the observed data ($k=3$ affected in $n=12$ offspring) are approximately $0.1164$ times as likely under the digenic recessive model (Model $D$) as they are under the monogenic recessive model (Model $M$). Therefore, the monogenic model is better supported by these data.",
