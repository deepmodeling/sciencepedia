            "introduction": "Understanding how health insurance premiums are set is fundamental to grasping the economics of healthcare financing. Insurers must carefully calculate premiums to cover expected medical costs for a diverse population while also accounting for administrative expenses and maintaining financial stability. This practice builds foundational skills in risk assessment and financial modeling by having you compute a community-rated premium based on the concept of expected value, and then determine the necessary loading factor to ensure an insurer's solvency. ",

            "problem": "An insurer offers a single community-rated health plan to a heterogeneous population. Each enrollee belongs to one of two clinical risk classes, indexed by $i \\in \\{A,B\\}$. In class $i$, an enrollee experiences a single illness event in a year with probability $\\pi_{i}$, and if it occurs, the monetary loss to the insurer is $L_{i}$. Let $w_{i}$ denote the fraction of the enrolled population in class $i$. Assume independence across enrollees and that each enrollee can experience at most one such reimbursable event per year.\n\nThe insurer seeks sustainability under a standard break-even condition: per-enrollee premium revenue must cover the per-enrollee expected claim cost, a variable administrative cost equal to a fraction $a$ of expected claims, a fixed administrative cost $c_{f}$ per enrollee, and a regulatory solvency reserve equal to a fraction $s$ of the collected premium. The insurer sets a single premium $P$ per enrollee. Define the actuarially fair premium $P^{\\ast}$ as the per-enrollee expected claim cost implied by the population risk mix.\n\nUsing only the definitions of expected value and the break-even accounting identity, proceed as follows:\n1) Derive $P^{\\ast}$ from first principles and compute its value for the following data: $w_{A}=0.7$, $\\pi_{A}=0.04$, $L_{A}=4000$, $w_{B}=0.3$, $\\pi_{B}=0.25$, $L_{B}=9000$.\n2) Let the loading factor $\\lambda$ be defined by $P=(1+\\lambda)P^{\\ast}$. Derive the expression for the minimum constant $\\lambda$ that achieves break-even when $a=0.06$, $c_{f}=120$, and $s=0.04$, and compute its value for the $P^{\\ast}$ obtained in part (1).\n\nRound both numerical answers to four significant figures. Express $P^{\\ast}$ in dollars per enrollee and $\\lambda$ as a decimal fraction (do not use a percent sign).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent set of definitions and data to solve a standard problem in actuarial science and health economics. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and computation of the actuarially fair premium, $P^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe problem defines the actuarially fair premium $P^{\\ast}$ as the per-enrollee expected claim cost implied by the population risk mix. The population consists of two mutually exclusive clinical risk classes, indexed by $i \\in \\{A, B\\}$.\n\nFor an enrollee in class $i$, an illness event giving rise to a claim occurs with probability $\\pi_{i}$, and the resulting monetary loss is $L_{i}$. The enrollee experiences no loss with probability $1-\\pi_{i}$. The expected claim cost for a single enrollee chosen from class $i$, denoted $E[C_i]$, is given by the definition of expected value:\n$$E[C_i] = \\pi_{i} \\cdot L_{i} + (1-\\pi_{i}) \\cdot 0 = \\pi_{i} L_{i}$$\n\nThe overall per-enrollee expected claim cost for the entire population, $P^{\\ast}$, is the weighted average of the expected costs for each class. The weights are the fractions of the enrolled population in each class, $w_{A}$ and $w_{B}$.\n$$P^{\\ast} = w_{A} E[C_A] + w_{B} E[C_B]$$\nSubstituting the expression for the expected cost of each class, we derive the formula for $P^{\\ast}$ from first principles:\n$$P^{\\ast} = w_{A} \\pi_{A} L_{A} + w_{B} \\pi_{B} L_{B}$$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $P^{\\ast}$ using the provided data: $w_{A}=0.7$, $\\pi_{A}=0.04$, $L_{A}=4000$, $w_{B}=0.3$, $\\pi_{B}=0.25$, and $L_{B}=9000$.\n$$P^{\\ast} = (0.7)(0.04)(4000) + (0.3)(0.25)(9000)$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = (0.028)(4000) + (0.075)(9000)$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = 112 + 675$$\n$$P^{\\ast} = 787$$\nThe value of the actuarially fair premium is exactly $787$ dollars per enrollee. Rounding to four significant figures gives $787.0$.\n\nPart 2: Derivation and computation of the minimum loading factor, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe insurer must achieve break-even, where total per-enrollee premium revenue equals total per-enrollee costs. The premium is denoted by $P$. The costs, on a per-enrollee basis, are:\n1.  Expected claim cost: $P^{\\ast}$\n2.  Variable administrative cost: $a P^{\\ast}$\n3.  Fixed administrative cost: $c_{f}$\n4.  Regulatory solvency reserve: $s P$\n\nThe break-even accounting identity is therefore:\n$$P = P^{\\ast} + a P^{\\ast} + c_{f} + s P$$\n\nWe need to derive an expression for the loading factor $\\lambda$, which is defined by the relation $P = (1+\\lambda)P^{\\ast}$. First, we solve the break-even identity for $P$ in terms of the cost parameters and $P^{\\ast}$.\n$$P - s P = P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}$$\n$$P(1-s) = P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}$$\n$$P = \\frac{P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}}{1-s}$$\n\nNow, we equate this expression for $P$ with its definition in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$(1+\\lambda)P^{\\ast} = \\frac{P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}}{1-s}$$\nTo find $\\lambda$, we first solve for $1+\\lambda$:\n$$1+\\lambda = \\frac{P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)}$$\nThen, we isolate $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f}}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)} - 1$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{P^{\\ast} (1+a) + c_{f} - P^{\\ast}(1-s)}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{P^{\\ast} + aP^{\\ast} + c_{f} - P^{\\ast} + sP^{\\ast}}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{aP^{\\ast} + sP^{\\ast} + c_{f}}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)}$$\nThis expression can be factored to yield the final derived form for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{P^{\\ast}(a+s) + c_{f}}{P^{\\ast}(1-s)}$$\n\nNow, we compute the value of $\\lambda$ using $P^{\\ast}=787$ from Part 1 and the provided data: $a=0.06$, $c_{f}=120$, and $s=0.04$.\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{787(0.06+0.04) + 120}{787(1-0.04)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{787(0.10) + 120}{787(0.96)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{78.7 + 120}{755.52}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{198.7}{755.52} \\approx 0.26300402$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\lambda = 0.2630$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for a new intervention compared to a status quo strategy for chronic disease management. The analysis is conducted over a finite horizon of $T=5$ years with an annual discount rate of $r=0.03$.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the calculation of the present value (PV) for the streams of costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The flows are specified as occurring at the end of each year $t$, for $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The present value of a stream of annual flows, $\\{x_t\\}_{t=1}^{T}$, is given by the formula:\n$$\nPV_x = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{x_t}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\nIn this problem, the annual costs, $c_{i,t}$, and annual QALYs, $u_{i,t}$, are constant for each strategy $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ over the time horizon.

The formula for the present value simplifies to:\n$$\nPV_x = x \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series. This sum, often called the present value annuity factor, $PVAF(r, T)$, can be calculated using the formula:\n$$\nPVAF(r, T) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-T}}{r}\n$$\nThe givens are:\n- Time horizon, $T = 5$ years.\n- Annual discount rate, $r = 0.03$.\n- Status quo (Strategy $0$): annual cost $c_0 = 2000$ and annual quality $u_0 = 0.60$.\n- Intervention (Strategy $1$): annual cost $c_1 = 2500$ and annual quality $u_1 = 0.68$.\n\nAs per the problem's instructions, we first compute the present value of costs and QALYs for each strategy. To do this, we first calculate the $PVAF(r, T)$ for the given parameters:\n$$\nPVAF(0.03, 5) = \\frac{1 - (1+0.03)^{-5}}{0.03} = \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\n$$\nNumerically, $(1.03)^{-5} \\approx 0.86260879$.\n$$\nPVAF(0.03, 5) \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.86260879}{0.03} = \\frac{0.13739121}{0.03} \\approx 4.579707\n$$\nWe shall retain this factor in symbolic form for as long as possible to maintain precision.\n\nNow, we compute the present value of costs for each strategy:\n- Present Value of Costs for Status Quo ($PV_{C_0}$):\n$$\nPV_{C_0} = c_0 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 2000 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 2000 \\cdot 4.579707 = 9159.414\n$$\n- Present Value of Costs for Intervention ($PV_{C_1}$):\n$$\nPV_{C_1} = c_1 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 2500 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 2500 \\cdot 4.579707 = 11449.268\n$$\nNext, we compute the present value of QALYs for each strategy. A QALY for a given year is the time duration (1 year) weighted by the health-related quality, $u_t$. Thus, the stream of QALYs is $\\{u_t\\}_{t=1}^T$.\n- Present Value of QALYs for Status Quo ($PV_{Q_0}$):\n$$\nPV_{Q_0} = u_0 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 0.60 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 0.60 \\cdot 4.579707 = 2.747824\n$$\n- Present Value of QALYs for Intervention ($PV_{Q_1}$):\n$$\nPV_{Q_1} = u_1 \\cdot PVAF(0.03, 5) = 0.68 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-5}}{0.03}\\right) \\approx 0.68 \\cdot 4.579707 = 3.114201\n$$\nThe problem then requires the calculation of the ICER, defined as the ratio of the incremental present value of costs to the incremental present value of QALYs.\n\nIncremental Cost ($\\Delta PV_C$):\n$$\n\\Delta PV_C = PV_{C_1} - PV_{C_0} = 11449.268 - 9159.414 = 2289.854\n$$\nIncremental QALYs ($\\Delta PV_Q$):\n$$\n\\Delta PV_Q = PV_{Q_1} - PV_{Q_0} = 3.114201 - 2.747824 = 0.366377\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ICER:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta PV_C}{\\Delta PV_Q} \\approx \\frac{2289.854}{0.366377} = 6250.00\n$$\nAn important observation arises from the algebraic structure of the problem. We can express the ICER symbolically before substituting numerical values for the $PVAF$ term:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{PV_{C_1} - PV_{C_0}}{PV_{Q_1} - PV_{Q_0}} = \\frac{c_1 \\cdot PVAF(r, T) - c_0 \\cdot PVAF(r, T)}{u_1 \\cdot PVAF(r, T) - u_0 \\cdot PVAF(r, T)}\n$$\nFactoring out the common $PVAF(r, T)$ term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{(c_1 - c_0) \\cdot PVAF(r, T)}{(u_1 - u_0) \\cdot PVAF(r, T)}\n$$\nSince $PVAF(r, T)$ must be non-zero for any finite $T>0$ and $r>0$, it can be cancelled from the fraction:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{c_1 - c_0}{u_1 - u_0}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that for the special case where the incremental costs and incremental QALYs are constant in each period, the ICER is independent of the time horizon and the discount rate.\nSubstituting the given values into this simplified formula:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{2500 - 2000}{0.68 - 0.60} = \\frac{500}{0.08} = 6250\n$$\nThis result is exact. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $6250$ has exactly four significant figures when written as $6.250 \\times 10^3$. Therefore, the value $6250$ satisfies the rounding requirement. The units are dollars per QALY.",
