            "problem": "A neonatology clinic is evaluating a child born at a gestational age of $30$ weeks who is now $10$ months chronological age. The goal is to reason from core definitions to a single quantitative summary that integrates corrected age and age-appropriate developmental expectations.\n\nUse only the following well-tested clinical facts as a fundamental base:\n- Term gestation is defined as $40$ weeks.\n- Corrected age for prematurity is defined in weeks as chronological age in weeks minus the number of weeks born before $40$ weeks.\n- For pediatric milestone comparisons, it is acceptable to compute corrected age in weeks and convert to months using $1$ month $=$ $4$ weeks for consistency across milestone charts.\n- Typical median ages (in months) for key milestones are: independent sitting at $7$ months and canonical babbling at $7$ months.\n\nDefine the Developmental Readiness Index $R$ as the ratio of the child’s corrected age in months, $A_{c}$, to the geometric mean of the median ages for independent sitting, $A_{s}$, and canonical babbling, $A_{b}$:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{A_{c}}{\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}}}.\n$$\n\nStarting from these definitions and facts (without introducing any additional rules), compute $R$ for this child. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Express your final answer as a unitless decimal.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions and data, allowing for the derivation of a unique, quantitative solution. The problem requires the calculation of a Developmental Readiness Index, $R$, for a child born prematurely. The solution will be constructed by rigorously applying the provided definitions and facts.\n\nThe problem defines the Developmental Readiness Index, $R$, as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{A_{c}}{\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}}}\n$$\nwhere $A_{c}$ is the child's corrected age in months, and $A_{s}$ and $A_{b}$ are the median ages for specific developmental milestones.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the child's corrected age, $A_{c}$. The calculation proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Determine the degree of prematurity.**\n    Term gestation is defined as $40$ weeks. The child was born at a gestational age of $30$ weeks. The number of weeks the child was born before reaching term gestation is the difference between these two values. Let this prematurity in weeks be denoted by $P$.\n    $$\n    P = (\\text{Term gestation}) - (\\text{Birth gestational age}) = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 30 \\text{ weeks} = 10 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Convert the chronological age to weeks.**\n    The child's chronological age is given as $10$ months. The problem specifies using the conversion factor of $1$ month $= 4$ weeks. Let the chronological age in months be $A_{chrono,mo}$ and in weeks be $A_{chrono,wk}$.\n    $$\n    A_{chrono,wk} = A_{chrono,mo} \\times \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{1 \\text{ month}}\\right) = 10 \\text{ months} \\times 4 \\frac{\\text{weeks}}{\\text{month}} = 40 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Calculate the corrected age in weeks.**\n    The corrected age is defined as the chronological age in weeks minus the number of weeks of prematurity. Let the corrected age in weeks be $A_{corr,wk}$.\n    $$\n    A_{corr,wk} = A_{chrono,wk} - P = 40 \\text{ weeks} - 10 \\text{ weeks} = 30 \\text{ weeks}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Convert the corrected age to months.**\n    The formula for $R$ requires the corrected age in months, denoted as $A_{c}$. We use the same conversion factor.\n    $$\n    A_{c} = A_{corr,wk} \\div \\left(\\frac{4 \\text{ weeks}}{1 \\text{ month}}\\right) = 30 \\text{ weeks} \\div 4 \\frac{\\text{weeks}}{\\text{month}} = 7.5 \\text{ months}\n    $$\n\nNow that $A_{c}$ is determined, we can compute the index $R$. The problem provides the median ages for the milestones:\n-   Independent sitting, $A_{s} = 7$ months.\n-   Canonical babbling, $A_{b} = 7$ months.\n\nThe denominator of the expression for $R$ is the geometric mean of these two ages.\n$$\n\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}} = \\sqrt{7 \\text{ months} \\times 7 \\text{ months}} = \\sqrt{49 \\text{ months}^2} = 7 \\text{ months}\n$$\n\nFinally, substitute the values of $A_{c}$ and the geometric mean into the definition of $R$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{A_{c}}{\\sqrt{A_{s}\\,A_{b}}} = \\frac{7.5 \\text{ months}}{7 \\text{ months}} = \\frac{7.5}{7}\n$$\nThe value is a unitless ratio. Performing the division:\n$$\nR \\approx 1.07142857...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $7$, and $1$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\nR \\approx 1.071\n$$\nThis value represents the child's developmental status, based on corrected age, relative to the typical timing of the specified milestones. A value of $R=1.0$ would indicate that the child's corrected age exactly matches the geometric mean of the milestone ages. In this case, the child's corrected age is slightly advanced relative to this benchmark.",

This practice moves beyond a simple \"on time\" or \"late\" judgment by introducing the Z-score, a powerful statistical tool used to quantify exactly how far an individual's development deviates from the population average.

            "problem": "A pediatric clinic maintains reference distributions for ages at which infants achieve developmental milestones. The age at independent walking for typically developing infants is well-approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 12.1$ months and standard deviation $\\sigma = 1.5$ months, based on large-scale normative data. A new patient walked independently at age $x = 15$ months. Using fundamental properties of the normal distribution and standardization to the standard normal, determine the standardized score (Z-score) for this child relative to the reference distribution and the corresponding percentile rank under the assumption of normality. Report the Z-score rounded to four significant figures. Express the percentile rank as a decimal fraction and round it to four significant figures. No units are required for the final numerical values.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear, self-contained set of conditions for a standard statistical calculation based on the properties of the normal distribution, a fundamental concept in biostatistics and epidemiology. All data ($\\mu = 12.1$, $\\sigma = 1.5$, $x = 15$) are provided and are dimensionally and contextually consistent.\n\nLet the random variable $X$ represent the age in months at which an infant begins to walk independently. The problem states that $X$ is well-approximated by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 12.1$ months and standard deviation $\\sigma = 1.5$ months. We can write this as $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, where $\\mu = 12.1$ and $\\sigma = 1.5$.\n\nWe are given an observed value for a new patient, $x = 15$ months. Our objective is to determine the standardized score (Z-score) and the corresponding percentile rank for this observation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Z-score. The Z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean. It is calculated by transforming the random variable $X$ into a standard normal random variable $Z$, where $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$. The transformation formula is:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nSubstituting the given values for our specific observation $x$:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{15 - 12.1}{1.5}$$\n$$z = \\frac{2.9}{1.5}$$\n$$z \\approx 1.93333...$$\nThe problem requires the Z-score to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the standardized score is:\n$$z \\approx 1.933$$\n\nNext, we determine the percentile rank. The percentile rank is the proportion of the population that falls at or below a given value. For a continuous distribution, this is given by the value of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) at that point. For a normal distribution, the percentile rank of an observation $x$ is $P(X \\le x)$. By standardizing, this is equivalent to finding the CDF of the standard normal distribution, denoted by $\\Phi(z)$, for the calculated Z-score.\n$$\\text{Percentile Rank} = P(X \\le 15) = P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{15 - 12.1}{1.5}\\right) = P(Z \\le 1.93333...)$$\nThis value is given by $\\Phi(1.93333...)$. We can find this value using standard normal distribution tables or statistical software.\nUsing a high-precision calculator for the standard normal CDF:\n$$\\Phi(1.93333...) \\approx 0.973410$$\nThe problem requires the percentile rank to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Percentile Rank} \\approx 0.9734$$\nThis means that an infant walking at $15$ months is at approximately the $97.34$-th percentile; that is, they started walking later than about $97.34\\%$ of the reference population of typically developing infants.\n\nThe two required values are the Z-score, $z \\approx 1.933$, and the percentile rank, approximately $0.9734$.",

Let $T^+$ be a positive test result and $T^-$ be a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.10$. From this, $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- Sensitivity: $P(T^+|D) = \\text{Sens} = 0.80$.\n- Specificity: $P(T^-|D^c) = \\text{Spec} = 0.85$.\n\nFrom these, we can also define:\n- False Negative Rate: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - \\text{Sens} = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$.\n- False Positive Rate: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - \\text{Spec} = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of PPV and NPV**\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is the probability that a child has GDD given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Sens} \\times p) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p))$$\nTherefore, the full expression for $PPV$ is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\times p}{(\\text{Sens} \\times p) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p))}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.80 \\times 0.10}{(0.80 \\times 0.10) + (0.15 \\times 0.90)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.135} = \\frac{0.08}{0.215} \\approx 0.372093$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.3721$.\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the probability that a child does not have GDD given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)) + ((1 - \\text{Sens}) \\times p)$$\nTherefore, the full expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)}{(\\text{Spec} \\times (1 - p)) + ((1 - \\text{Sens}) \\times p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.85 \\times 0.90}{(0.85 \\times 0.90) + (0.20 \\times 0.10)} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.02} = \\frac{0.765}{0.785} \\approx 0.974522$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9745$.\n\n**Part 2: Interpretation of Action**\n\nThe clinic's policy is to refer to Early Intervention (EI) if the $PPV$ is at least $0.30$. Our calculated $PPV$ is $0.3721$. Since $0.3721 \\ge 0.30$, the appropriate action for a child with a positive screen is immediate referral to EI.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation and Calculation of Minimal Prevalence $p^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe need to find the prevalence, denoted $p^{\\ast}$, for which the $PPV$ is exactly equal to the threshold $PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = 0.30$. We set the symbolic expression for $PPV$ equal to this threshold, with $p = p^{\\ast}$.\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = \\frac{\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}}{(\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}) + ((1 - \\text{Spec}) \\times (1 - p^{\\ast}))}$$\nTo solve for $p^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} [(\\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})(1 - p^{\\ast})] = \\text{Sens} \\times p^{\\ast}$$\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})p^{\\ast} = \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast}$$\nGather all terms containing $p^{\\ast}$ on one side:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} - PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} \\cdot p^{\\ast} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})p^{\\ast}$$\nFactor out $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = p^{\\ast} [\\text{Sens} - PPV_{\\text{thresh}} \\cdot \\text{Sens} + PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})]$$\n$$PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec}) = p^{\\ast} [\\text{Sens}(1 - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})PPV_{\\text{thresh}}]$$\nIsolating $p^{\\ast}$ gives the symbolic solution:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{PPV_{\\text{thresh}}(1 - \\text{Spec})}{\\text{Sens}(1 - PPV_{\\text{thresh}}) + (1 - \\text{Spec})PPV_{\\text{thresh}}}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $p^{\\ast}$ using $\\text{Sens} = 0.80$, $\\text{Spec} = 0.85$, and $PPV_{\\text{thresh}} = 0.30$.\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.30(1 - 0.85)}{0.80(1 - 0.30) + (1 - 0.85)(0.30)}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.30(0.15)}{0.80(0.70) + (0.15)(0.30)}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.045}{0.56 + 0.045}$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.045}{0.605} \\approx 0.074380165$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimal prevalence is $p^{\\ast} = 0.07438$.\nThis is the final answer requested.",
