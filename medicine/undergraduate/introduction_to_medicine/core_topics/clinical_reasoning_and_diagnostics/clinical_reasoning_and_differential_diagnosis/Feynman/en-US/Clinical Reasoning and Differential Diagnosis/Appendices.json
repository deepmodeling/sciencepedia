            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A new bedside screening assay for Disease $X$ is evaluated against a reference standard.\n- The evaluation data is presented as a $2 \\times 2$ contingency summary.\n- For individuals with Disease $X$ (condition positive):\n    - True Positives (TP): $288$\n    - False Negatives (FN): $32$\n- For individuals without Disease $X$ (condition negative):\n    - False Positives (FP): $102$\n    - True Negatives (TN): $578$\n- The task is to:\n    1.

Compute the Youden index, $J$, from the sensitivity and specificity.\n    4. Report $J$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of biostatistics and epidemiology used for evaluating diagnostic tests. The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, true/false positives/negatives, and the Youden index are standard, well-defined metrics in clinical medicine. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data (TP, FN, FP, TN) are explicitly provided to calculate the requested metrics. The instructions are clear and lead to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using objective, quantitative language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe analysis begins with the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, which are core measures of a diagnostic test's performance.\n\nLet $D^+$ be the event that an individual has Disease $X$, and $D^-$ be the event that an individual does not have Disease $X$.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the assay yields a positive result, and $T^-$ be the event that the assay yields a negative result.\n\nThe provided data can be summarized as follows:\n- Number of True Positives (TP): Number of individuals with the disease who test positive, $N(T^+ \\cap D^+) = 288$.\n- Number of False Negatives (FN): Number of individuals with the disease who test negative, $N(T^- \\cap D^+) = 32$.\n- Number of False Positives (FP): Number of individuals without the disease who test positive, $N(T^+ \\cap D^-) = 102$.\n- Number of True Negatives (TN): Number of individuals without the disease who test negative, $N(T^- \\cap D^-) = 578$.\n\nThe total number of individuals with the disease is the sum of true positives and false negatives:\n$$N(D^+) = \\text{TP} + \\text{FN} = 288 + 32 = 320$$\n\nThe total number of individuals without the disease is the sum of true negatives and false positives:\n$$N(D^-) = \\text{TN} + \\text{FP} = 578 + 102 = 680$$\n\n**1. Computation of Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nSensitivity (also known as the true positive rate) is the probability that the test is positive, given that the individual has the disease. It is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D^+) = \\frac{\\text{TP}}{\\text{TP} + \\text{FN}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{288}{288 + 32} = \\frac{288}{320} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9 $$\n\nSpecificity (also known as the true negative rate) is the probability that the test is negative, given that the individual does not have the disease. It is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^-) = \\frac{\\text{TN}}{\\text{TN} + \\text{FP}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{578}{578 + 102} = \\frac{578}{680} = \\frac{17}{20} = 0.85 $$\n\n**2. Explanation of Metrics and Clinical Implications**\n\n**Sensitivity:** The computed sensitivity of the assay is $0.9$, or $90\\%$. This value quantifies the test's ability to correctly identify individuals who have Disease $X$. Specifically, it means that if $100$ individuals with Disease $X$ were tested, the assay would correctly identify approximately $90$ of them as positive, while $10$ would be missed (false negatives). A high sensitivity is critical when the consequences of missing a diagnosis (a false negative) are severe. In the context of differential diagnosis, a test with high sensitivity is particularly useful for \"ruling out\" a disease. If such a test returns a negative result, it provides strong evidence that the patient does not have the disease, because the test rarely misses the disease when it is present. The high sensitivity of $0.9$ suggests this assay is effective for this purpose.\n\n**Specificity:** The computed specificity of the assay is $0.85$, or $85\\%$. This value quantifies the test's ability to correctly identify individuals who do not have Disease $X$. It means that if $100$ individuals without Disease $X$ were tested, the assay would correctly identify approximately $85$ of them as negative, while $15$ would receive an incorrect positive result (false positives). A high specificity is important to avoid unnecessary follow-up procedures, costs, and patient anxiety associated with a false positive diagnosis. In differential diagnosis, a test with high specificity is useful for \"ruling in\" a disease. If such a test returns a positive result, it provides strong evidence that the patient does indeed have the disease, because the test rarely gives a positive result for healthy individuals. The specificity of $0.85$ is reasonably good, but indicates a non-trivial false positive rate ($15\\%$). Thus, a positive result from this assay strengthens the suspicion of Disease $X$, but may warrant confirmation with a more definitive test before initiating treatment, depending on the clinical context.\n\n**3. Computation of the Youden Index**\n\nThe Youden index, $J$, is a single statistic that summarizes the performance of a diagnostic test. It measures the test's ability to discriminate between those with and without the disease. It is defined as:\n$$ J = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1 $$\nThe value of $J$ ranges from $0$ to $1$, where $1$ represents a perfect test and $0$ represents a test with no discriminative ability (equivalent to chance).\n\nUsing the computed values for sensitivity and specificity:\n$$ J = 0.9 + 0.85 - 1 $$\n$$ J = 1.75 - 1 = 0.75 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final value to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The value $0.75$ has two significant figures. To express it with four, we append trailing zeros.\n$$ J = 0.7500 $$\nThis value indicates a good, but not perfect, level of diagnostic performance.",

            "introduction": "While sensitivity and specificity describe a test's performance in a controlled setting, clinicians need to know what a test result means for their specific patient. This is where predictive values come in, translating intrinsic test accuracy into practical, population-dependent probabilities. This practice demonstrates how to calculate Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV) by integrating test characteristics with disease prevalence, answering the critical questions: \"How likely is the disease given a positive result?\" and \"How confident can I be in a negative result?\" .",

            "solution": "The problem is to derive and compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for a new influenza test, given its sensitivity, specificity, and the disease prevalence in a specific population. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in probability theory and epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has influenza, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have influenza.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n-   Prevalence of influenza, $P(D) = P = 0.12$.\n-   Sensitivity of the test, $Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$.\n-   Specificity of the test, $Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.88$.\n\nFrom these, we can deduce a few other probabilities:\n-   The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - P = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n-   The probability of a negative test given the patient has the disease (False Negative Rate) is $P(T^- | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$.\n-   The probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease (False Positive Rate) is $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12$.\n\n**Derivation of PPV and NPV**\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, i.e., $P(D | T^+)$.\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, i.e., $P(D^c | T^-)$.\n\nWe will use the definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, and the law of total probability. These principles combined form Bayes' theorem, which is the foundation for these derivations.\n\n**Derivation of PPV:**\nBy definition, $PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$.\nThe numerator, the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, can be expressed as $P(D \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) = Se \\cdot P$.\nThe denominator, the total probability of a positive test, is found using the law of total probability by conditioning on the disease status:\n$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$\n$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P))$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator, we get the general formula for PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P)}$$\n\n**Derivation of NPV:**\nBy definition, $NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(D^c \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$.\nThe numerator, the joint probability of not having the disease and testing negative, can be expressed as $P(D^c \\cap T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) = Sp \\cdot (1 - P)$.\nThe denominator, the total probability of a negative test, is found using the law of total probability:\n$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$\n$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1 - P)) + ((1 - Se) \\cdot P)$\nSubstituting the expressions for the numerator and denominator, we get the general formula for NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - P)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - P) + (1 - Se) \\cdot P}$$\n\n**Computation of PPV and NPV**\n\nUsing the given values: $P = 0.12$, $Se = 0.92$, and $Sp = 0.88$.\n\n**PPV Calculation:**\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.12}{0.92 \\cdot 0.12 + (1 - 0.88) \\cdot (1 - 0.12)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.1104}{0.1104 + (0.12) \\cdot (0.88)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.1104}{0.1104 + 0.1056}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.1104}{0.216}$$\n$$PPV = 0.511111...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV \\approx 0.5111$.\n\n**NPV Calculation:**\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.88 \\cdot (1 - 0.12)}{0.88 \\cdot (1 - 0.12) + (1 - 0.92) \\cdot 0.12}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.88 \\cdot 0.88}{0.88 \\cdot 0.88 + (0.08) \\cdot 0.12}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.7744}{0.7744 + 0.0096}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.7744}{0.784}$$\n$$NPV = 0.987755...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV \\approx 0.9878$.\n\n**Interpretation for Clinical Decision-Making**\n\nThe computed Positive Predictive Value is $PPV \\approx 0.5111$, or $51.11\\%$. This signifies that for an adult patient with acute respiratory symptoms in this clinic during peak season, a positive test result confers a $51.11\\%$ probability of actually having influenza. While this increases the post-test probability from the pre-test probability (prevalence) of $12\\%$, it is not high enough to be diagnostically conclusive. Nearly half ($48.89\\%$) of the positive results are false positives. Therefore, a clinician should not rely solely on a positive result to initiate treatment (e.g., antiviral medication) without considering other clinical findings or, if necessary, a more accurate confirmatory test.\n\nThe computed Negative Predictive Value is $NPV \\approx 0.9878$, or $98.78\\%$. This indicates that if a patient tests negative, there is a $98.78\\%$ probability that they do not have influenza. This is a very high degree of certainty. A negative result is extremely reliable for ruling out influenza. In a clinical context, this high NPV allows the clinician to confidently exclude influenza from the differential diagnosis and investigate other causes for the patient's symptoms, thus avoiding unnecessary antiviral therapy.\n\nIn summary, for this particular test in this population, it is much more powerful as a tool to rule out influenza (high NPV) than to rule it in (modest PPV).",

We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the post-test probability of a disease from first principles using the odds-based formulation of Bayes' theorem and then to compute this probability for the given patient.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI).\nLet $D^c$ be the complement event, i.e., the patient does not have an AMI.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay yields a negative result.\n\nThe givens are:\nThe pre-test probability of AMI: $P(D) = p_0 = 0.25$.\nThe negative likelihood ratio for the assay: $LR_- = 0.05$.\n\nFrom the pre-test probability, we can find the probability of not having the disease:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 $$\n\nThe goal is to compute the post-test probability of AMI given a negative test result, which is denoted as $P(D|T^-)$.\n\nWe begin by defining the odds of an event. The odds of an event $A$ are the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of the event not occurring, $O(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$.\n\nThe pre-test odds of having the disease are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0} $$\n\nThe post-test odds of having the disease, given a negative test result, are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(D|T^-)}{P(D^c|T^-)} $$\n\nTo derive the relationship between pre-test and post-test odds, we apply Bayes' theorem to both the numerator and the denominator of the post-test odds expression.\nBayes' theorem states that for two events $A$ and $B$, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.\n\nApplying this to our terms:\n$$ P(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D) P(D)}{P(T^-)} $$\n$$ P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for post-test odds:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^-|D) P(D)}{P(T^-)}}{\\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}} $$\n\nThe term $P(T^-)$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{P(T^-|D) P(D)}{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)} $$\n\nWe can regroup the terms as follows:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left( \\frac{P(T^-|D)}{P(T^-|D^c)} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} \\right) $$\n\nThe first term, $\\frac{P(T^-|D)}{P(T^-|D^c)}$, is the definition of the negative likelihood ratio, $LR_-$.
