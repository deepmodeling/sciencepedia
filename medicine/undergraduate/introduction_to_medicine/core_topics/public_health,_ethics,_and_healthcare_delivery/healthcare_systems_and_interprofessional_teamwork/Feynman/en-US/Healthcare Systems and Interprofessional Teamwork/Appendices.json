Queueing theory provides a powerful mathematical framework to analyze systems where demand, such as arriving patients, meets limited capacity, like a single triage nurse or a CT scanner. This practice delves into a foundational queueing model to understand the critical relationship between patient arrival rates, service times, and the resulting congestion, revealing how operational changes driven by teamwork can dramatically improve efficiency and the patient experience .",

            "problem": "A single triage nurse at an outpatient clinic performs brief intake tasks for arriving patients before they proceed to the next step of care. Patients arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ (patients per hour), and the triage task duration for each patient is independent and exponentially distributed with rate $\\mu$ (per hour). The triage station operates under a First-In First-Out (FIFO) discipline and has a single server, forming a standard $M/M/1$ queue. Assume $\\lambda < \\mu$ so that a steady state exists. Use only fundamental definitions of a Poisson process and exponential service, the birth–death steady-state structure, and the memoryless property of the exponential distribution; do not invoke any prederived queueing-time formulas.\n\n1. Derive the steady-state distribution of the total time in system $T$ for an arriving patient (from arrival to completion of triage), providing both the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function in closed form. Your derivation must start from the steady-state probabilities for the number in system and condition on the number present upon arrival. Define and justify any stochastic properties you use, such as Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages (PASTA).\n\n2. Using your derived distribution, compute the exact symbolic expression for the expected total time in system $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ as a function of $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$. Express the expected time in hours. No rounding is required.\n\n3. Briefly interpret the utilization $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$ in this clinical context and explain, in terms of interprofessional teamwork, what changes to $\\lambda$ or $\\mu$ mean operationally and how they would affect $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Focus your interpretation on what $\\rho$ represents and the stability requirement $\\rho < 1$.\n\nYour final reported answer should be only the exact symbolic expression for $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ in terms of $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$.",
            "solution": "The system is described as an $M/M/1$ queue. The first '$M$' signifies Markovian or memoryless arrivals (a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$). The second '$M$' indicates memoryless service times (an exponential distribution with rate $\\mu$). The '$1$' signifies a single server (the triage nurse). The stability condition $\\lambda < \\mu$ ensures the queue does not grow infinitely.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Steady-State Distribution of Total Time in System $T$**\n\nFirst, we find the steady-state probability distribution of the number of patients in the system, $N$. Let $P_n$ be the probability of having $n$ patients in the system. The system is a birth-death process with birth rate $\\lambda_n = \\lambda$ and death rate $\\mu_n = \\mu$ for $n \\ge 1$.\n\nThe steady-state balance equations are $\\lambda P_{n-1} = \\mu P_n$ for $n \\ge 1$.\nDefining the utilization $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$, we get the recursive relationship $P_n = \\rho P_{n-1}$, which leads to $P_n = \\rho^n P_0$.\nUsing the normalization condition $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_n = 1$, we have:\n$$ P_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = P_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{1-\\rho} \\right) = 1 \\implies P_0 = 1 - \\rho $$\nThe steady-state distribution is therefore a geometric distribution:\n$$ P_n = (1-\\rho) \\rho^n \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots $$\n\nNext, we derive the distribution of the total time in system, $T$. The **Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages (PASTA)** property states that an arriving patient finds $n$ patients in the system with probability $P_n$.\nIf an arrival finds $n$ patients, their total time $T$ is the sum of their own service time plus the service times of the $n$ patients ahead of them. Due to the **memoryless property** of the exponential service time distribution, the remaining service time for the patient in service is also exponential with rate $\\mu$. Thus, the arriving patient must wait for $n+1$ independent, exponentially distributed service times, each with rate $\\mu$.\n\nThe sum of $k$ independent exponential random variables with rate $\\mu$ follows an Erlang distribution, $\\text{Erlang}(k, \\mu)$. So, $T$ conditioned on finding $n$ patients, $T|(N=n)$, follows an $\\text{Erlang}(n+1, \\mu)$ distribution. Its PDF is $f_{T|N=n}(t) = \\frac{\\mu^{n+1} t^n \\exp(-\\mu t)}{n!}$.\n\nTo find the unconditional PDF of $T$, $f_T(t)$, we use the law of total probability:\n$$ f_T(t) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} f_{T|N=n}(t) P_n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\mu^{n+1} t^n \\exp(-\\mu t)}{n!} \\right) \\left( (1-\\rho)\\rho^n \\right) $$\n$$ f_T(t) = (1-\\rho)\\mu\\exp(-\\mu t) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(\\mu \\rho t)^n}{n!} $$\nRecognizing the series as $\\exp(\\mu\\rho t)$, we get:\n$$ f_T(t) = (1-\\rho)\\mu\\exp(-\\mu t) \\exp(\\mu\\rho t) = (1-\\rho)\\mu\\exp(-\\mu(1-\\rho)t) $$\nSubstituting $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$:\n$$ f_T(t) = (\\mu-\\lambda)\\exp(-(\\mu-\\lambda)t) $$\nThis is the PDF of an exponential distribution with rate $\\mu-\\lambda$.\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F_T(t) = 1 - \\exp(-(\\mu-\\lambda)t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Expected Total Time in System $\\mathbb{E}[T]$**\n\nThe expected value of an exponential random variable with rate $\\alpha$ is $1/\\alpha$. Since $T$ follows an exponential distribution with rate $\\mu - \\lambda$, its expected value is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of $\\rho$ and its Impact on $\\mathbb{E}[T]$**\n\nThe utilization factor $\\rho = \\lambda/\\mu$ represents the long-run fraction of time the triage nurse is busy. The stability condition $\\rho < 1$ ($\\lambda < \\mu$) is essential; it means the nurse can process patients faster than they arrive.\n\nInterprofessional teamwork can improve system performance by:\n- **Increasing $\\mu$ (Service Rate):** Redesigning the workflow (e.g., a medical assistant helps with preliminary tasks) increases the nurse's effective service rate.\n- **Managing $\\lambda$ (Arrival Rate):** Better scheduling and coordination can smooth out patient arrivals, reducing peak demand.\n\nThe expected time in system, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = 1/(\\mu-\\lambda)$, shows a non-linear relationship. As utilization $\\rho \\to 1$, the denominator approaches zero, and wait times increase dramatically. This demonstrates that teamwork-driven efficiency gains (increasing $\\mu$) are most impactful in high-utilization environments.",

This high false alarm rate consumes significant interprofessional team resources and can lead to \"alert fatigue,\" where clinicians may start to ignore alerts.\n\n**2. Sensitivity (True Positive Rate)**\nSensitivity is the probability that the alert will fire given that a patient has sepsis.

Specificity (True Negative Rate)**\nSpecificity is the probability that the alert will not fire given that a patient does not have sepsis.

The committee uses cost-effectiveness analysis grounded in fundamental definitions: incremental cost is defined as $\\Delta C = C_1 - C_0$, where $C_1$ and $C_0$ are the expected costs per patient with the new program and usual care, respectively; incremental health effect is defined as $\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0$, where $E_1$ and $E_0$ are the expected health effects per patient measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) with the new program and usual care.

            "solution": "The problem requires evaluating a new healthcare program using cost-effectiveness analysis. The central metric for this analysis is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which quantifies the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit (in this case, per Quality-Adjusted Life Year, or QALY). The formula is:\n$$ ICER = \\frac{\\text{Incremental Cost}}{\\text{Incremental Effect}} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_1 - C_0}{E_1 - E_0} $$\nThe decision rule is to compare the ICER to the health system's willingness-to-pay threshold ($\\lambda$).

The program’s cost per QALY gained is below the willingness-to-pay threshold, indicating the program is cost-effective relative to usual care; the interprofessional committee should recommend adoption while also weighing budget impact, equity, and feasibility.**\nThis option is correct. It accurately states that the ICER (\"cost per QALY gained\") is below the threshold, correctly concludes the program is cost-effective, and correctly notes that the final decision involves other practical considerations, as mentioned in the problem.\n\n**B. Because the program increases costs compared with usual care, it cannot be cost-effective unless it actually saves money; therefore, the committee should not adopt it.**\nThis is incorrect. Cost-effectiveness analysis is specifically designed for interventions that add cost to achieve better outcomes. An intervention does not need to be cost-saving to be considered good value.\n\n**C. The key quantity for decision-making is the difference in total costs divided by the program’s total QALYs (not the change in QALYs versus usual care); a higher value than the threshold demonstrates better value and supports adoption.**\nThis is incorrect. The proper metric is the *incremental* ratio ($ICER = \\Delta C / \\Delta E$). Furthermore, a *lower* ICER represents better value, and it must be *below* the threshold for the intervention to be deemed cost-effective.\n\n**D. If the incremental QALY gain is small, the committee should default to non-adoption regardless of the threshold, since small effects are not meaningful in cost-effectiveness analysis.**\nThis is incorrect. The magnitude of the effect ($\\Delta E$) is evaluated relative to its cost ($\\Delta C$) via the ICER. A small health gain can be very cost-effective if achieved at a low cost. There is no rule to dismiss small gains outright without considering the cost.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct analysis and conclusion.",
