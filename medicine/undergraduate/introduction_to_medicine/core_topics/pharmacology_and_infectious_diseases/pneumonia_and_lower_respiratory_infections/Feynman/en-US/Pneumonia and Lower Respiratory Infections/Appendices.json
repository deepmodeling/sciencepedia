            "problem": "A middle-aged adult presents to the Emergency Department (ED) with fever, cough, and pleuritic chest pain. Based on history, examination, and epidemiology, the clinician estimates a pretest probability of pneumonia of $p_{0} = 0.25$. Suppose chest radiography interpreted for radiographic consolidation consistent with community-acquired pneumonia has sensitivity $Se = 0.80$ and specificity $Sp = 0.90$, and the patient’s film is read as positive. Starting only from the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and Bayes theorem, derive the post-test probability of pneumonia after a positive chest radiograph. Express your final answer as a decimal, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical diagnostics and probability theory, is well-posed with all necessary data provided, and is stated objectively. We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has pneumonia, and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the patient does not have pneumonia. Let $T^+$ be the event that the chest radiograph is positive, and $T^-$ be the event that it is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into the language of conditional probability:\nThe pretest probability of pneumonia is $P(D) = p_{0} = 0.25$.\nThe probability of not having pneumonia is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nThe test characteristics are given by its sensitivity and specificity.\nSensitivity ($Se$) is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present:\n$$Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.80$$\nSpecificity ($Sp$) is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent:\n$$Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.90$$\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of pneumonia given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T^+)$. The problem requires us to derive this starting from fundamental definitions, including that of likelihood ratios and Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased patient to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased patient.\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D)}{P(T^+|D^c)}$$\nThe numerator is the sensitivity, $Se$. The denominator, $P(T^+|D^c)$, is the probability of a false positive. Since a person without the disease can only test positive or negative, we have $P(T^+|D^c) + P(T^-|D^c) = 1$. Therefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nSubstituting the value for specificity:\n$$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\n\nThe core of the derivation is Bayes' theorem, which relates the post-test probability $P(D|T^+)$ to the pretest probability $P(D)$ and the test evidence:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term $P(T^+)$ is the overall probability of a positive test result, regardless of disease status. It can be calculated using the law of total probability by marginalizing over the disease states:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting this expansion into Bayes' theorem gives the full form required for calculation:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)}$$\nWe can now substitute the known values into this expression:\n$P(T^+|D) = Se = 0.80$\n$P(D) = p_0 = 0.25$\n$P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 0.10$\n$P(D^c) = 1 - p_0 = 0.75$\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(0.80)(0.25)}{(0.80)(0.25) + (0.10)(0.75)}$$\nFirst, we calculate the products in the numerator and the denominator:\nThe numerator is $(0.80) \\times (0.25) = 0.20$.\nThe terms in the denominator are $(0.80) \\times (0.25) = 0.20$ and $(0.10) \\times (0.75) = 0.075$.\nThe denominator is the sum of these terms: $0.20 + 0.075 = 0.275$.\n\nSo, the post-test probability is the ratio:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{0.20}{0.275}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{200}{275} = \\frac{8}{11} \\approx 0.727272...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.7273$$\n\nAlternatively, using the odds-likelihood ratio formulation as requested by the prompt's mention of likelihood ratios:\nThe pretest odds are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(D)}{1-P(D)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe positive likelihood ratio is $LR^+ = \\frac{Se}{1-Sp} = \\frac{0.80}{1-0.90} = \\frac{0.80}{0.10} = 8$.\nThe post-test odds are $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR^+ = \\frac{1}{3} \\times 8 = \\frac{8}{3}$.\nTo convert the post-test odds back to a probability, we use the formula $P = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1+\\text{Odds}}$:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{1 + \\frac{8}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}}{\\frac{11}{3}} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\nThis confirms the previous calculation. Rounding $\\frac{8}{11}$ to four significant figures gives $0.7273$.\nThe post-test probability of pneumonia after a positive chest radiograph is $0.7273$.",
