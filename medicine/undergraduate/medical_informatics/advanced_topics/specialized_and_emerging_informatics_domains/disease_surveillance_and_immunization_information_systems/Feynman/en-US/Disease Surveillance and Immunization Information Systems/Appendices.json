            "problem": "A public health department is implementing a standardized binary indicator for an influenza A disease surveillance case definition to aggregate laboratory results from Health Level Seven version $2$ (HL7 v$2$) Observation/Result (OBX) segments coded with Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). You are given one patient encounter containing multiple OBX segments from a single day. The indicator must be computed by normalizing test codes and values according to a specified value set and decision logic. The binary indicator is defined as $1$ if there is any positive laboratory evidence for influenza A and $0$ otherwise. Your task is to compute this indicator for the encounter.\n\nUse the following context, which reflects standard laboratory messaging conventions and widely used public health surveillance practices:\n\n- The LOINC value set for influenza A laboratory evidence includes the following codes: $44569-9$ (influenza A ribonucleic acid presence by nucleic acid amplification test), $57406-3$ (influenza A antigen presence by rapid immunoassay), and $30334-0$ (influenza A ribonucleic acid quantitative copies per milliliter by nucleic acid amplification test). Only these codes are considered influenza A evidence for this exercise.\n- Interpretive value normalization is required for textual results in OBX-$5$, using the following mutually exclusive sets (comparison is case-insensitive):\n  - Positive strings $S_{\\text{pos}} = \\{\\text{\"POS\"}, \\text{\"Positive\"}, \\text{\"Detected\"}, \\text{\"Reactive\"}\\}$.\n  - Negative strings $S_{\\text{neg}} = \\{\\text{\"NEG\"}, \\text{\"Negative\"}, \\text{\"Not Detected\"}, \\text{\"Nonreactive\"}\\}$.\n  - Inconclusive strings $S_{\\text{inc}} = \\{\\text{\"Inconclusive\"}, \\text{\"Equivocal\"}, \\text{\"Indeterminate\"}\\}$.\n- For quantitative results (OBX-$5$ containing a numeric value in copies per milliliter for LOINC $30334-0$), define a positivity threshold $T = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ copies per milliliter. A quantitative value $v$ is interpreted as positive if $v \\geq T$, negative if $v < T$, and inconclusive if the numeric value or unit is missing.\n- Decision logic for the binary indicator $I$ on a set of OBX segments $E$ for a single encounter:\n  - Filter to influenza A evidence: retain only those OBX segments whose OBX-$3$ LOINC is in the influenza A value set $\\{44569-9, 57406-3, 30334-0\\}$.\n  - For each retained OBX, interpret OBX-$5$ by the normalization rules above to classify it as positive evidence, negative evidence, or inconclusive.\n  - Set the encounter-level indicator $I$ to $1$ if there exists at least one retained OBX classified as positive evidence; otherwise set $I$ to $0$.\n\nThe encounter has the following OBX segments (simplified to relevant fields), with one OBX per bullet:\n\n- OBX-$1$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $44569-9$; OBX-$5$ value \"Not detected\".\n- OBX-$2$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $57406-3$; OBX-$5$ value \"DETECTED\".\n- OBX-$3$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $30334-0$; OBX-$5$ value \"8.0 × 10^2 copies/mL\".\n- OBX-$4$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $40982-1$; OBX-$5$ value \"Positive\".\n- OBX-$5$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $76080-1$; OBX-$5$ value \"NEG\".\n- OBX-$6$: OBX-$3$ LOINC $12345-6$; OBX-$5$ value \"Equivocal\".\n\nCompute the standardized binary influenza A indicator $I$ for this encounter, applying the rules exactly as specified.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a binary influenza A indicator, denoted as $I$, for a patient encounter based on a set of six laboratory result segments (OBX). The computation follows a specific, multi-step decision logic.\n\nBefore proceeding to a solution, we must first validate the problem statement.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Indicator Definition:** The binary indicator $I$ is set to $1$ if there is any positive laboratory evidence for influenza A within the encounter, and $0$ otherwise.\n- **Influenza A LOINC Value Set:** The set of Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) that constitutes evidence for influenza A is $V_{\\text{LOINC}} = \\{44569-9, 57406-3, 30334-0\\}$.\n- **Textual Result Normalization:** For qualitative tests, result values are normalized using case-insensitive matching against three sets:\n  - Positive strings: $S_{\\text{pos}} = \\{\\text{\"POS\"}, \\text{\"Positive\"}, \\text{\"Detected\"}, \\text{\"Reactive\"}\\}$.\n  - Negative strings: $S_{\\text{neg}} = \\{\\text{\"NEG\"}, \\text{\"Negative\"}, \\text{\"Not Detected\"}, \\text{\"Nonreactive\"}\\}$.\n  - Inconclusive strings: $S_{\\text{inc}} = \\{\\text{\"Inconclusive\"}, \\text{\"Equivocal\"}, \\text{\"Indeterminate\"}\\}$.\n- **Quantitative Result Normalization:** For quantitative results with LOINC $30334-0$, a value $v$ is positive if $v \\geq T$, where the threshold $T = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}$ copies per milliliter. The result is negative if $v < T$.\n- **Decision Logic:**\n  $1$. Filter the given OBX segments, retaining only those whose OBX-$3$ LOINC is in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$.\n  $2$. Classify each retained OBX segment as positive, negative, or inconclusive by normalizing its OBX-$5$ value.\n  $3$. If at least one retained segment is classified as positive, set $I=1$; otherwise, set $I=0$.\n- **Input Data:** Six OBX segments, OBX-$1$ through OBX-$6$, are provided with their respective LOINC codes and values.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the domain of medical informatics and public health reporting. It employs standard terminologies (LOINC) and data structures (HL7) in a manner consistent with their real-world application. The problem is well-posed: it provides a complete, self-contained, and unambiguous set of rules and data, which guarantees a unique and deterministic solution. The language is objective and free of any non-formalizable or subjective claims. All required definitions and constraints are provided, and they are internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution by systematically applying the specified decision logic.\n\n**Step I: Filter OBX Segments by LOINC Code**\nWe examine the OBX-$3$ LOINC code of each of the $6$ input segments to determine if it belongs to the influenza A value set $V_{\\text{LOINC}} = \\{44569-9, 57406-3, 30334-0\\}$.\n\n- **OBX-$1$**: The LOINC is $44569-9$. This code is in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **retained**.\n- **OBX-$2$**: The LOINC is $57406-3$. This code is in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **retained**.\n- **OBX-$3$**: The LOINC is $30334-0$. This code is in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **retained**.\n- **OBX-$4$**: The LOINC is $40982-1$. This code is not in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **discarded**.\n- **OBX-$5$**: The LOINC is $76080-1$. This code is not in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **discarded**.\n- **OBX-$6$**: The LOINC is $12345-6$. This code is not in $V_{\\text{LOINC}}$. This segment is **discarded**.\n\nThe set of relevant segments for further analysis consists of OBX-$1$, OBX-$2$, and OBX-$3$.\n\n**Step II: Classify Retained Segments by Value**\nNext, we interpret the OBX-$5$ value for each retained segment to classify it as providing positive, negative, or inconclusive evidence.\n\n- **Analysis of OBX-$1$**: The LOINC is $44569-9$, indicating a qualitative test. The OBX-$5$ value is `\"Not detected\"`. As per the textual normalization rules, this value matches an entry in the negative strings set $S_{\\text{neg}}$. Therefore, OBX-$1$ represents **negative** evidence.\n\n- **Analysis of OBX-$2$**: The LOINC is $57406-3$, indicating a qualitative test. The OBX-$5$ value is `\"DETECTED\"`. The comparison is case-insensitive, so `\"DETECTED\"` matches `\"Detected\"` from the positive strings set $S_{\\text{pos}}$. Therefore, OBX-$2$ represents **positive** evidence.\n\n- **Analysis of OBX-$3$**: The LOINC is $30334-0$, indicating a quantitative test. The OBX-$5$ value is `\"8.0 × 10^2 copies/mL\"`. We extract the numeric value $v = 8.0 \\times 10^2 = 800$. This value must be compared to the specified positivity threshold $T = 1.0 \\times 10^{3} = 1000$. The rule for negativity is $v  T$. Since $800  1000$, this condition is satisfied. Therefore, OBX-$3$ represents **negative** evidence.\n\n**Step III: Determine the Encounter-Level Indicator $I$**\nThe final step is to aggregate the individual segment classifications to compute the encounter-level indicator $I$. The rule states that $I=1$ if there exists at least one positive evidence; otherwise, $I=0$.\n\nOur analysis of the retained segments yielded the following classifications:\n- OBX-$1$: Negative\n- OBX-$2$: Positive\n- OBX-$3$: Negative\n\nBecause OBX-$2$ provides positive evidence for influenza A, the condition for setting the indicator to $1$ is met. The presence of other negative results (from OBX-$1$ and OBX-$3$) does not override a positive finding according to the specified \"any positive\" logic.\n\nTherefore, the standardized binary influenza A indicator $I$ for this encounter is $1$.",

The use of different evidence types (lab tests, clinical signs) and their combination via Boolean logic is authentic. The given sensitivity values are realistic for their respective methods. The concept of conditional independence, while a strong assumption, is a common and necessary simplification in building such models. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined. It provides a clear logical expression for the criterion $C$, gives all necessary input probabilities (component sensitivities), and explicitly states the assumption of conditional independence required for calculation. The objective, computing $P(C \\mid D)$, is unambiguous. A unique mathematical solution exists and can be derived from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and formal mathematical and epidemiological language. There is no subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed with a full derivation and solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the overall sensitivity of the case definition $C$, which is the probability $P(C \\mid D)$. For notational simplicity, let $p(E)$ denote the probability of any event $E$ conditional on the true disease state $D$, i.e., $p(E) \\equiv P(E \\mid D)$. The problem's givens can be written as:\n- $p(T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}) = 0.94$\n- $p(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}) = 0.78$\n- $p(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}}) = 0.85$\n- $p(S_{\\mathrm{fever}}) = 0.82$\n- $p(S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = 0.60$\n- $p(S_{\\mathrm{cough}}) = 0.55$\n\nThe case definition is a logical disjunction (OR) of three clauses:\n$$ C \\equiv C_1 \\lor C_2 \\lor C_3 $$\nwhere\n- $C_1 \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}$\n- $C_2 \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land (S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}})$\n- $C_3 \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$\n\nThese clauses are not independent because $C_2$ and $C_3$ both depend on the event $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$. A direct application of the inclusion-exclusion principle is possible but computationally intensive. A more structured approach is to partition the problem based on the state of the shared event, $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$. Using the law of total probability, we can express $p(C)$ as:\n$$ p(C) = p(C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) + p(C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) $$\nWe will calculate each term separately.\n\n**Term 1: Calculation of $p(C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}})$**\n\nWe first simplify the logical expression for the event $C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$:\n$$ C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\equiv \\Big(T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land (S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}})\\big) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big)\\Big) \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}} $$\nBy the distributive law of logic, we have:\n$$ (T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land (S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big) $$\nUsing the absorption law, $(A \\lor B) \\land B \\equiv B$, the term $(S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$ simplifies to $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$. The expression becomes:\n$$ (T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) $$\nFactoring out $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$ gives:\n$$ C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\equiv S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\land \\Big( T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}}) \\Big) $$\nThe events $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}}$, and $S_{\\mathrm{cough}}$ are all mutually independent given $D$. Therefore, the event $S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$ is independent of the event $K \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}})$. We can write the probability as a product:\n$$ p(C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = p(S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\times p(K) $$\nTo find $p(K)$, we note that its constituent events $T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}$, and $(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}})$ depend on disjoint sets of the original independent indicators. Thus, they are mutually independent. It is easier to calculate the probability of the complement, $\\neg K$:\n$$ p(K) = 1 - p(\\neg K) = 1 - p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land \\neg T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land \\neg(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}})) $$\n$$ p(K) = 1 - p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}) \\times p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}) \\times p(\\neg(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}})) $$\nWe calculate the component probabilities:\n- $p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}) = 1 - p(T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}) = 1 - 0.94 = 0.06$\n- $p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}) = 1 - p(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}) = 1 - 0.78 = 0.22$\n- $p(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}}) = p(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}}) \\times p(S_{\\mathrm{cough}}) = 0.85 \\times 0.55 = 0.4675$\n- $p(\\neg(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}})) = 1 - 0.4675 = 0.5325$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p(K)$:\n$$ p(K) = 1 - (0.06 \\times 0.22 \\times 0.5325) = 1 - (0.0132 \\times 0.5325) = 1 - 0.007029 = 0.992971 $$\nNow we can compute the first term:\n$$ p(C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = p(S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\times p(K) = 0.60 \\times 0.992971 = 0.5957826 $$\n\n**Term 2: Calculation of $p(C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}})$**\n\nSimilarly, we simplify the logical expression for $C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$:\n$$ C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\equiv \\Big(T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land (S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}})\\big) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big)\\Big) \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}} $$\nDistributing $\\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$:\n$$ (T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land (S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big) \\lor \\big(T_{\\mathrm{ELISA}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{cough}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}\\big) $$\nThe third clause contains $S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$, which is a logical contradiction (False), so this term vanishes. In the second clause, $(S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\lor S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$ simplifies to $S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$. The expression becomes:\n$$ (T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}} \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) $$\nFactoring out $\\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$:\n$$ C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\equiv \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}} \\land \\Big( T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}}) \\Big) $$\nAs before, $\\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}$ is independent of the event $L \\equiv T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\lor (T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}})$. The probability is:\n$$ p(C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = p(\\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\times p(L) $$\nWe calculate $p(L)$ using its complement, noting that $T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}$ and $(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}})$ are independent:\n$$ p(L) = 1 - p(\\neg L) = 1 - p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}} \\land \\neg(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}})) $$\n$$ p(L) = 1 - p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}}) \\times p(\\neg(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}})) $$\nWe calculate the component probabilities:\n- $p(\\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = 1 - p(S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$\n- $p(\\neg T_{\\mathrm{PCR}})$ is already known to be $0.06$.\n- $p(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}}) = p(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}}) \\times p(S_{\\mathrm{fever}}) = 0.78 \\times 0.82 = 0.6396$\n- $p(\\neg(T_{\\mathrm{RAT}} \\land S_{\\mathrm{fever}})) = 1 - 0.6396 = 0.3604$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $p(L)$:\n$$ p(L) = 1 - (0.06 \\times 0.3604) = 1 - 0.021624 = 0.978376 $$\nNow we can compute the second term:\n$$ p(C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) = p(\\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) \\times p(L) = 0.40 \\times 0.978376 = 0.3913504 $$\n\n**Final Combination**\n\nThe total probability $p(C)$ is the sum of the two terms:\n$$ p(C) = p(C \\land S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) + p(C \\land \\neg S_{\\mathrm{rash}}) $$\n$$ p(C) = 0.5957826 + 0.3913504 = 0.987133 $$\nThe overall sensitivity of the case definition is $0.987133$.

The data can be organized as follows, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are counts of reports:\n\n|               | Event $E$ | Other Events | Total      |\n|---------------|:---------:|:------------:|:----------:|\n| Vaccine $V_A$ |   $a$     |     $b$      | $a+b$      |\n| Other Vx      |   $c$     |     $d$      | $c+d$      |\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $a = 85$ (reports of $E$ for $V_A$)\n- $b = 915$ (reports of other events for $V_A$)\n- $c = 240$ (reports of $E$ for all other vaccines)\n- $d = 8760$ (reports of other events for all other vaccines)\n\nFrom these counts, we can calculate the totals for each vaccine group:\n- Total reports for $V_A$: $n_A = a+b = 85 + 915 = 1000$\n- Total reports for other vaccines: $n_O = c+d = 240 + 8760 = 9000$\n\nThe Proportional Reporting Ratio ($PRR$) is defined as the ratio of two proportions. The first proportion, $p_A$, is the fraction of reports for vaccine $V_A$ that are for the event $E$. The second proportion, $p_O$, is the corresponding fraction for all other vaccines combined.\n\nThe proportion of event $E$ among reports for vaccine $V_A$ is:\n$$p_A = \\frac{a}{a+b} = \\frac{85}{1000} = 0.085$$\n\nThe proportion of event $E$ among reports for other vaccines is:\n$$p_O = \\frac{c}{c+d} = \\frac{240}{9000} = \\frac{24}{900} = \\frac{2}{75} \\approx 0.02667$$\n\nThe $PRR$ is the ratio of these two proportions:\n$$PRR = \\frac{p_A}{p_O} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{c/(c+d)} = \\frac{0.085}{2/75} = 0.085 \\times 37.5 = 3.1875$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the $PRR$ is $3.19$.\n\nNext, we compute the $95\\%$ confidence interval ($CI$) for the $PRR$ using a log-normal approximation. This involves calculating a $CI$ for the natural logarithm of the $PRR$, $\\ln(PRR)$, and then exponentiating the interval's endpoints. The variance of $\\ln(PRR)$ is required for this calculation.\n\nThe expression for $\\ln(PRR)$ is:\n$$\\ln(PRR) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_A}{p_O}\\right) = \\ln(p_A) - \\ln(p_O)$$\nSince the two sets of reports (for $V_A$ and for other vaccines) are independent, the variance of the difference of their log-proportions is the sum of their individual variances:\n$$Var(\\ln(PRR)) = Var(\\ln(p_A)) + Var(\\ln(p_O))$$\nThe variance of the logarithm of an estimated proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$ can be approximated using the delta method. The number of events $k$ is treated as a binomial random variable, $K \\sim Bin(n, \\pi)$, where $\\hat{p}$ is the estimate of $\\pi$. The variance of $\\hat{p}$ is $Var(\\hat{p}) = \\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n}$.\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{p})) \\approx \\left(\\frac{d}{d\\pi} \\ln(\\pi)\\right)^2 Var(\\hat{p}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\pi(1-\\pi)}{n} = \\frac{1-\\pi}{n\\pi}$$\nWe estimate this variance by substituting the observed proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$:\n$$s^2(\\ln(\\hat{p})) = \\frac{1-\\hat{p}}{n\\hat{p}} = \\frac{1 - k/n}{n(k/n)} = \\frac{(n-k)/n}{k} = \\frac{n-k}{nk}$$\nApplying this formula to our two proportions, $p_A$ and $p_O$:\n- For $p_A = a/(a+b)$, the estimated variance is $Var(\\ln(p_A)) \\approx \\frac{(a+b)-a}{a(a+b)} = \\frac{b}{a(a+b)}$.\n- For $p_O = c/(c+d)$, the estimated variance is $Var(\\ln(p_O)) \\approx \\frac{(c+d)-c}{c(c+d)} = \\frac{d}{c(c+d)}$.\n\nThe variance of $\\ln(PRR)$ is therefore estimated as:\n$$Var(\\ln(PRR)) \\approx \\frac{b}{a(a+b)} + \\frac{d}{c(c+d)}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Var(\\ln(PRR)) \\approx \\frac{915}{85(1000)} + \\frac{8760}{240(9000)} = \\frac{915}{85000} + \\frac{8760}{2160000} \\approx 0.0107647 + 0.0040556 \\approx 0.0148203$$\nThe standard error ($SE$) of $\\ln(PRR)$ is the square root of its variance:\n$$SE(\\ln(PRR)) = \\sqrt{Var(\\ln(PRR))} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0148203} \\approx 0.121738$$\nAn approximate $95\\%$ $CI$ for $\\ln(PRR)$ is given by $\\ln(PRR) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times SE(\\ln(PRR))$, where $\\alpha=0.05$ and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe value of $\\ln(PRR)$ is $\\ln(3.1875) \\approx 1.15926$.\nThe margin of error ($ME$) is $1.96 \\times 0.121738 \\approx 0.23861$.\nThe $95\\%$ $CI$ for $\\ln(PRR)$ is:\n$$1.15926 \\pm 0.23861 = [0.92065, 1.39787]$$\nTo obtain the $CI$ for the $PRR$, we exponentiate the lower and upper bounds of the log-scale interval:\n- Lower bound: $CI_{low} = \\exp(0.92065) \\approx 2.5109$\n- Upper bound: $CI_{high} = \\exp(1.39787) \\approx 4.0463$\nRounding the bounds to $3$ significant figures gives the $95\\%$ $CI$ for the $PRR$ as $(2.51, 4.05)$.\n\nInterpretation: The null expectation, representing no disproportionality in reporting between vaccine $V_A$ and other vaccines, corresponds to a $PRR$ of $1$. Our calculated point estimate of the $PRR$ is $3.19$, which indicates that the adverse event $E$ was reported over $3$ times as frequently for vaccine $V_A$ relative to all other vaccines in the database. The $95\\%$ confidence interval of $(2.51, 4.05)$ does not include the null value of $1$. This provides statistically significant evidence of disproportionality. This result constitutes a statistical \"signal\" that would typically trigger further investigation by safety experts to evaluate the possibility of a causal relationship between vaccine $V_A$ and event $E$.",
