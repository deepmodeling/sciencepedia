            "problem": "A hospital is integrating clinical genomics into its Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. The variant calling pipeline provides a per-genotype confidence score called Genotype Quality (GQ), reported on the Phred scale.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to perform calculations related to the Phred quality scale in the context of genomic data analysis. We will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Definition of Phred quality score $Q$: $Q = -10 \\log_{10}(p)$, where $p$ is the probability of error. The problem uses $GQ$ to denote this score.\n- Number of pharmacogenomic genotype calls per patient: $N = 200$.\n- Tolerance for the expected number of false genotype calls per patient: $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n- Assumption 1: Each reported genotype has an error probability $p$ determined by its $GQ$ score. For setting a threshold, we assume all reported calls have a quality score equal to the minimum threshold, which represents the worst-case scenario.\n- Assumption 2: The expected number of false calls is the sum of the individual error probabilities.\n- Objective (a): Express $p$ as a function of $GQ$.\n- Objective (b): Calculate $p$ for $GQ = 20$.\n- Objective (c): Find the smallest integer threshold $GQ^{\\ast}$ such that the expected number of false genotype calls is at most $\\alpha$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The Phred scale and its definition, $Q = -10 \\log_{10}(p)$, are fundamental and standard concepts in bioinformatics and genomics for quantifying the quality of sequence data and variant calls. The problem of setting a quality threshold to control the error rate is a common and practical task in clinical genomics. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated, providing all necessary data ($N$, $\\alpha$) and definitions to derive the required quantities ($p(GQ)$, $p(20)$, and $GQ^{\\ast}$). The objectives are explicit and lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is formulated using precise, quantitative language, free from any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**(a) Express the error probability $p$ as a function of $GQ$.**\n\nWe are given the definition of the Genotype Quality ($GQ$) score on the Phred scale:\n$$GQ = -10 \\log_{10}(p)$$\nOur goal is to solve this equation for the error probability, $p$.\n\nFirst, we isolate the logarithm term by dividing both sides by $-10$:\n$$-\\frac{GQ}{10} = \\log_{10}(p)$$\nTo solve for $p$, we use the definition of the base-$10$ logarithm, which states that if $y = \\log_{10}(x)$, then $x = 10^y$. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n$$p = 10^{-\\frac{GQ}{10}}$$\nThis expression gives the error probability $p$ as a function of the $GQ$ score.\n\n**(b) Determine the probability of a false genotype call for $GQ=20$.**\n\nUsing the formula derived in part (a), we substitute $GQ = 20$:\n$$p(20) = 10^{-\\frac{20}{10}}$$\n$$p(20) = 10^{-2}$$\n$$p(20) = \\frac{1}{10^2} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\nSo, a genotype call with a $GQ$ score of $20$ has a $1\\%$ chance of being incorrect.\n\n**(c) Derive the smallest integer threshold $GQ^{\\ast}$.**\n\nThe hospital reports $N = 200$ genotypes. Let $GQ^{\\ast}$ be the minimum quality threshold. To ensure the quality of all reported genotypes, we must consider the worst-case scenario where all $N$ genotypes have a quality score equal to this minimum threshold, $GQ^{\\ast}$. In this case, the error probability for each of the $N$ calls is $p(GQ^{\\ast})$.\n\nThe expected number of false calls, $E[\\text{false calls}]$, is the sum of the error probabilities of each call. Under our worst-case assumption, this is:\n$$E[\\text{false calls}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p(GQ^{\\ast}) = N \\cdot p(GQ^{\\ast})$$\nThe hospital requires this expected number to not exceed a tolerance $\\alpha = 0.05$. This gives us the following inequality:\n$$N \\cdot p(GQ^{\\ast}) \\le \\alpha$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p(GQ^{\\ast})$ from part (a) and the given values for $N$ and $\\alpha$:\n$$200 \\cdot 10^{-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10}} \\le 0.05$$\nNow we solve for $GQ^{\\ast}$:\n$$10^{-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10}} \\le \\frac{0.05}{200}$$\n$$10^{-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10}} \\le \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-2}}{2 \\times 10^{2}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$$\nAn alternative way to write the right-hand side is $\\frac{1}{4000}$.\n$$10^{-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10}} \\le \\frac{1}{4000}$$\nTo solve for $GQ^{\\ast}$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides. Since $\\log_{10}(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(10^{-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10}}\\right) \\le \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{1}{4000}\\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{GQ^{\\ast}}{10} \\le -\\log_{10}(4000)$$\nMultiply both sides by $-10$. This action reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$GQ^{\\ast} \\ge 10 \\log_{10}(4000)$$\nWe can simplify the logarithm term:\n$$\\log_{10}(4000) = \\log_{10}(4 \\times 1000) = \\log_{10}(4) + \\log_{10}(1000) = \\log_{10}(2^2) + 3 = 2 \\log_{10}(2) + 3$$\nThe value of $\\log_{10}(2)$ is approximately $0.30103$.\n$$GQ^{\\ast} \\ge 10 (2 \\cdot (0.30103) + 3)$$\n$$GQ^{\\ast} \\ge 10 (0.60206 + 3)$$\n$$GQ^{\\ast} \\ge 10 (3.60206)$$\n$$GQ^{\\ast} \\ge 36.0206$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer threshold $GQ^{\\ast}$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $36.0206$ is $37$.\nTherefore, the minimum integer $GQ$ threshold must be $37$.\nThe final answers for part (b) and part (c) are $0.01$ and $37$, respectively.",

A Variant Call Format (VCF) record reports a single-base insertion on Genome Reference Consortium human build 38 (GRCh38) at chromosome $1$ position $100$, with reference allele \"G\" and alternate allele \"GA\", indicating that an \"A\" is inserted immediately after the \"G\" at this site.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the \"first altered codon index\" for a specific single-base insertion variant. The solution will be derived from the foundational principles of molecular biology and the provided coordinate system definitions.\n\nThe givens are:\n- A single-base insertion on chromosome $1$ at genomic position $100$.\n- The reference allele is 'G' and the alternate allele is 'GA'. This corresponds to an insertion of one 'A' nucleotide after the 'G' at position $100$.\n- The HGVS coding DNA coordinate for the genomic position $100$ is $\\mathrm{c.}51$.\n- Codons are triplets of nucleotides, i.e., they have a length of $3$.\n- The HGVS coding DNA coordinate system is $1$-based, with $\\mathrm{c.}1$ being the first nucleotide of the start codon.\n- The \"first altered codon index\" is the $1$-based position of the first amino acid in the translated protein that can be different from the reference sequence.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between the nucleotide position in the coding DNA sequence (CDS) and the codon position.\nThe first codon consists of nucleotides $\\mathrm{c.}1$, $\\mathrm{c.}2$, and $\\mathrm{c.}3$.\nThe second codon consists of nucleotides $\\mathrm{c.}4$, $\\mathrm{c.}5$, and $\\mathrm{c.}6$.\nIn general, for a codon at index $k$ (where $k$ is a positive integer), the nucleotides are at positions $\\mathrm{c.}(3k-2)$, $\\mathrm{c.}(3k-1)$, and $\\mathrm{c.}(3k)$.\n\nConversely, to find the codon index $k$ that contains a nucleotide at position $\\mathrm{c.}N$, we can use the ceiling function. The index $k$ is the smallest integer such that $N \\le 3k$. This is mathematically expressed as:\n$$k = \\lceil \\frac{N}{3} \\rceil$$\n\nThe problem states that the insertion occurs after the nucleotide at genomic position $100$, which corresponds to the coding DNA coordinate $\\mathrm{c.}51$. We must first identify which codon contains the nucleotide $\\mathrm{c.}51$.\nUsing the formula above with $N = 51$:\n$$k = \\left\\lceil \\frac{51}{3} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 17 \\rceil = 17$$\nThus, the nucleotide at position $\\mathrm{c.}51$ is part of the $17$th codon.\n\nSince $51$ is an exact multiple of $3$ ($51 = 3 \\times 17$), the nucleotide at $\\mathrm{c.}51$ is the third and final nucleotide of the $17$th codon. The nucleotides comprising the $17$th codon are $\\mathrm{c.}49$, $\\mathrm{c.}50$, and $\\mathrm{c.}51$.\n\nThe variant is an insertion of a single 'A' nucleotide immediately *after* the nucleotide at $\\mathrm{c.}51$. This means the genetic sequence up to and including the nucleotide at $\\mathrm{c.}51$ is unaltered. The reading frame for translation proceeds by grouping nucleotides into triplets.\nThe codons from index $1$ to $17$ are read from an unchanged sequence.\n- Codon $1$: ($\\mathrm{c.}1, \\mathrm{c.}2, \\mathrm{c.}3$)\n- ...\n- Codon $17$: ($\\mathrm{c.}49, \\mathrm{c.}50, \\mathrm{c.}51$)\n\nTherefore, the amino acids at positions $1$ through $17$ of the polypeptide chain will be identical to those produced from the reference sequence.\n\nThe insertion occurs after position $\\mathrm{c.}51$. The nucleotides that would have formed the $18$th codon in the reference sequence are $\\mathrm{c.}52$, $\\mathrm{c.}53$, and $\\mathrm{c.}54$.\nReference sequence codons:\n$$...

(\\mathrm{c.}49, \\mathrm{c.}50, \\mathrm{c.}51) \\text{'A'} (\\mathrm{c.}52, \\mathrm{c.}53, \\mathrm{c.}54) ...$$\nThe translation machinery continues to read in triplets from the point of the last translated codon. After codon $17$ is translated, the new reading frame is established:\n$$... (\\mathrm{c.}49, \\mathrm{c.}50, \\mathrm{c.}51) (\\text{'A'}, \\mathrm{c.}52, \\mathrm{c.}53) (\\mathrm{c.}54, ...) ...$$\n$$ \\text{Codon } 17 \\qquad\\quad \\text{New Codon } 18 $$\n\nThe insertion has a length of $1$ nucleotide. As this is not a multiple of $3$, it causes a frameshift mutation. The frameshift begins immediately after the point of insertion.\nThe first codon affected by this frameshift is the one that follows codon $17$. This is the codon at index $18$. In the reference sequence, codon $18$ is formed by $(\\mathrm{c.}52, \\mathrm{c.}53, \\mathrm{c.}54)$. In the variant sequence, the codon at position $18$ is now formed by $(\\text{'A'}, \\mathrm{c.}52, \\mathrm{c.}53)$. Since this new codon is composed of different nucleotides, it will almost certainly translate to a different amino acid (or a premature stop codon).\n\nTherefore, the first amino acid that can differ from the reference translation is the one at position $18$.

The baseline risk (probability) is given as $p_0 = 0.05$.\n$$O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.05}{1-0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{5}{95} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the odds for the individual in question. The problem states that the odds ratio per one standard deviation increase in PRS is $r = 1.6$. The odds are said to multiply multiplicatively. For an individual with a PRS of $z$ standard deviations from the mean, the individualized odds, $O(z)$, are given by:\n$$O(z) = O_0 \\times r^z$$\n\nThe individual has a PRS of $+2$, so $z = 2$. We can calculate their individualized odds, $O_{ind}$:\n$$O_{ind} = O(2) = O_0 \\times r^2$$\nSubstituting the values for $O_0$ and $r$:\n$$O_{ind} = \\left(\\frac{1}{19}\\right) \\times (1.6)^2 = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 2.56 = \\frac{2.56}{19}$$\n\nFinally, we convert these individualized odds back into an absolute risk (probability), $p_{ind}$:\n$$p_{ind} = \\frac{O_{ind}}{1+O_{ind}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $O_{ind}$:\n$$p_{ind} = \\frac{\\frac{2.56}{19}}{1 + \\frac{2.56}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{2.56}{19}}{\\frac{19}{19} + \\frac{2.56}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{2.56}{19}}{\\frac{19 + 2.56}{19}} = \\frac{2.56}{21.56}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$p_{ind} = \\frac{2.56}{21.56} \\approx 0.11873840445...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $1$, $8$, and $7$. The fifth significant digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$p_{ind} \\approx 0.1187$$\n\nThus, the individualized $10$-year absolute risk for a person with a PRS of $+2$ is approximately $0.1187$.",
