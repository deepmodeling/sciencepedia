This exercise provides a quantitative look at this phenomenon, demonstrating how simple dietary substitutions can lead to a significant reduction in total energy intake even when the mass of food consumed remains the same. By calculating the energy difference between two daily diets, you will gain a practical understanding of how specific food choices directly contribute to the energy imbalance driving the obesity epidemic .",

It is self-contained, scientifically sound, complete, and clearly structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceed with the solution.\n\nThe total daily energy intake, $E$, is the sum of the energy contributions from each of the $N$ food items consumed.

We must calculate the total energy intake for the original diet, $E_o$, and for the substituted diet, $E_s$.\n\nThe total energy intake for the original diet is:\n$$E_o = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} d_{o,i} m_i = d_{o,1}m_1 + d_{o,2}m_2 + d_{o,3}m_3 + d_{o,4}m_4$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E_o = (4.0 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(90\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (2.2 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(450\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (0.45 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(600\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (5.3 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(70\\,\\mathrm{g})$$\nCalculating each term:\n$E_{o,1} = 360\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{o,2} = 990\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{o,3} = 270\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{o,4} = 371\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\nSumming these values gives the total original intake:\n$$E_o = 360 + 990 + 270 + 371 = 1991\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\n\nThe total energy intake for the substituted diet is calculated similarly, using the energy densities for the substituted foods, $d_{s,i}$, while the masses, $m_i$, remain unchanged.\n$$E_s = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} d_{s,i} m_i = d_{s,1}m_1 + d_{s,2}m_2 + d_{s,3}m_3 + d_{s,4}m_4$$\nSubstituting the values for the substituted diet:\n$$E_s = (1.0 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(90\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (1.4 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(450\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (0 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(600\\,\\mathrm{g}) + (4.0 \\frac{\\mathrm{kcal}}{\\mathrm{g}})(70\\,\\mathrm{g})$$\nCalculating each term:\n$E_{s,1} = 90\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{s,2} = 630\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{s,3} = 0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\n$E_{s,4} = 280\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$\nSumming these values gives the total substituted intake:\n$$E_s = 90 + 630 + 0 + 280 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\n\nThe change in daily energy intake, $\\Delta E$, is defined as the original intake minus the substituted intake.\n$$\\Delta E = E_o - E_s$$\n$$\\Delta E = 1991\\,\\mathrm{kcal} - 1000\\,\\mathrm{kcal} = 991\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\nAlternatively, $\\Delta E$ can be calculated as the sum of the changes for each item:\n$$\\Delta E = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} (d_{o,i} - d_{s,i}) m_i$$\n$$\\Delta E = (4.0-1.0)(90) + (2.2-1.4)(450) + (0.45-0)(600) + (5.3-4.0)(70)$$\n$$\\Delta E = (3.0)(90) + (0.8)(450) + (0.45)(600) + (1.3)(70)$$\n$$\\Delta E = 270 + 360 + 270 + 91 = 991\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $991$, is an exact integer with three significant figures. To express this result with four significant figures, a trailing zero is added after the decimal point.\n$$\\Delta E = 991.0\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\nThis representation indicates precision to the tenths place.",
