            "problem": "A bilateral donor government provides Development Assistance for Health (DAH) to a partner country over three consecutive years, denoted by $t_1$, $t_2$, and $t_3$. The nominal disbursements (that is, current-price amounts measured in the donor’s currency without adjusting for inflation) are given as $N_{t_1} = 50$, $N_{t_2} = 60$, and $N_{t_3} = 66$, each in millions of United States dollars (USD). To compare purchasing power across years, use the donor economy’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator index, which is normalized to the base year $t_1$ as $D_{t_1} = 1.00$, and observed values $D_{t_2} = 1.05$ and $D_{t_3} = 1.10$. The GDP deflator is defined as the ratio of nominal to real aggregate output prices, and when normalized to a base year, it provides an index $D_t$ of relative price levels across time.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of nominal versus real quantities and the GDP deflator, compute:\n1. The constant-dollar (real) disbursements $R_{t_1}$, $R_{t_2}$, and $R_{t_3}$ in base-year $t_1$ dollars.\n2.

All necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe core relationship required to solve this problem is the conversion of a nominal (current-price) quantity to a real (constant-price) quantity using a price index. The GDP deflator, $D_t$, serves as this price index. The problem states that the deflator is an index of relative price levels across time, normalized to a base year $t_1$. The constant-dollar (real) disbursement for any year $t$, denoted as $R_t$, is calculated by deflating the nominal disbursement, $N_t$, by the corresponding price index, $D_t$. The formula is:\n$$R_t = \\frac{N_t}{D_t}$$\nAll real values will be expressed in currency units of the base year, which is $t_1$.\n\nThe givens are:\nNominal disbursements:\n$N_{t_1} = 50$ (in millions of USD)\n$N_{t_2} = 60$ (in millions of USD)\n$N_{t_3} = 66$ (in millions of USD)\n\nGDP deflator index (base year $t_1$):\n$D_{t_1} = 1.00$\n$D_{t_2} = 1.05$\n$D_{t_3} = 1.10$\n\nFirst, we compute the real disbursements for each year.\n\nFor year $t_1$:\nThe real disbursement $R_{t_1}$ is calculated using $N_{t_1}$ and $D_{t_1}$.\n$$R_{t_1} = \\frac{N_{t_1}}{D_{t_1}} = \\frac{50}{1.00} = 50$$\nSo, the real disbursement in year $t_1$ is $50$ million base-year $t_1$ dollars.\n\nFor year $t_2$:\nThe real disbursement $R_{t_2}$ is calculated using $N_{t_2}$ and $D_{t_2}$. We express the deflator as a fraction for an exact calculation: $D_{t_2} = 1.05 = \\frac{105}{100} = \\frac{21}{20}$.\n$$R_{t_2} = \\frac{N_{t_2}}{D_{t_2}} = \\frac{60}{\\frac{21}{20}} = \\frac{60 \\times 20}{21} = \\frac{1200}{21}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$:\n$$R_{t_2} = \\frac{1200 \\div 3}{21 \\div 3} = \\frac{400}{7}$$\nSo, the real disbursement in year $t_2$ is $\\frac{400}{7}$ million base-year $t_1$ dollars.\n\nFor year $t_3$:\nThe real disbursement $R_{t_3}$ is calculated using $N_{t_3}$ and $D_{t_3}$. We express the deflator as a fraction: $D_{t_3} = 1.10 = \\frac{110}{100} = \\frac{11}{10}$.\n$$R_{t_3} = \\frac{N_{t_3}}{D_{t_3}} = \\frac{66}{\\frac{11}{10}} = \\frac{66 \\times 10}{11} = 6 \\times 10 = 60$$\nSo, the real disbursement in year $t_3$ is $60$ million base-year $t_1$ dollars.\n\nNext, we compute the real year-over-year growth rates.

The cost of each intervention $i \\in I$ is given by the vector $\\mathbf{C} = (C_1, C_2, C_3) = (20, 30, 50)$, with units of millions of USD.

We introduce a binary decision variable $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for each intervention $i$, where $x_i = 1$ if intervention $i$ is selected and $x_i = 0$ if it is not.\n\nThe objective is to maximize the total DALYs averted, $D$:\n$$\\text{Maximize } D = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_i x_i = 400x_1 + 300x_2 + 500x_3$$\n\nThis is subject to the budget constraint, where the total cost cannot exceed the available budget $B$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} C_i x_i = 20x_1 + 30x_2 + 50x_3 \\le 60$$\n\nSince the number of interventions is small ($n=3$), we can solve this problem by enumerating all possible combinations (portfolios) of interventions and evaluating their feasibility and effectiveness. The total number of possible portfolios is $2^3 = 8$.\n\nLet's evaluate each possible portfolio, represented by the vector $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$:\n1.  Portfolio $(0, 0, 0)$: Total Cost = $0$. Total DALYs = $0$. Feasible.\n2.  Portfolio $(1, 0, 0)$: Total Cost = $20$. Total DALYs = $400$. Feasible.\n3.  Portfolio $(0, 1, 0)$: Total Cost = $30$. Total DALYs = $300$. Feasible.\n4.  Portfolio $(0, 0, 1)$: Total Cost = $50$. Total DALYs = $500$. Feasible.\n5.  Portfolio $(1, 1, 0)$: Total Cost = $C_1 + C_2 = 20 + 30 = 50$. Total DALYs = $E_1 + E_2 = 400 + 300 = 700$. Feasible.\n6.  Portfolio $(1, 0, 1)$: Total Cost = $C_1 + C_3 = 20 + 50 = 70$. This exceeds the budget of $60$. Not feasible.\n7.  Portfolio $(0, 1, 1)$: Total Cost = $C_2 + C_3 = 30 + 50 = 80$. This exceeds the budget of $60$. Not feasible.\n8.  Portfolio $(1, 1, 1)$: Total Cost = $C_1 + C_2 + C_3 = 20 + 30 + 50 = 100$. This exceeds the budget of $60$. Not feasible.\n\nComparing the total DALYs averted for all feasible portfolios:\n- Portfolio $(0, 0, 0) \\implies D = 0$\n- Portfolio $(1, 0, 0) \\implies D = 400$\n- Portfolio $(0, 1, 0) \\implies D = 300$\n- Portfolio $(0, 0, 1) \\implies D = 500$\n- Portfolio $(1, 1, 0) \\implies D = 700$\n\nThe maximum value of DALYs averted among all feasible portfolios is $700$. This is achieved with the portfolio where interventions $1$ and $2$ are selected, and intervention $3$ is excluded.\n\nTherefore, the optimal decision vector is $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (1, 1, 0)$, and the maximum total DALYs averted is $D_{\\max} = 700$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix comprising all computed values: $\\begin{pmatrix}ACER_1 & ACER_2 & ACER_3 & x_1 & x_2 & x_3 & D_{\\max}\\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n- $ACER_1 = 0.05$\n- $ACER_2 = 0.1$\n- $ACER_3 = 0.1$\n- $x_1 = 1$\n- $x_2 = 1$\n- $x_3 = 0$\n- $D_{\\max} = 700$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}0.05 & 0.1 & 0.1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 700\\end{pmatrix}$.",

The context of DAH and infant mortality is a valid and common application. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data points and explicitly stating the critical identifying assumption (parallel trends) required for the DiD estimator to be interpreted as a causal effect. The language is objective and the data are internally consistent and plausible. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe difference-in-differences (DiD) estimator aims to isolate the causal effect of an intervention by comparing the change in an outcome over time between a treated group and an untreated control group. The core of the method relies on the parallel trends assumption, which is explicitly stated to hold in the problem. This assumption posits that any change observed in the control group over the two time periods represents the counterfactual trend that the treated group would have experienced had it not received the treatment.\n\nLet $Y_{i,t}$ denote the outcome for group $i \\in \\{\\text{T, C}\\}$ in time period $t \\in \\{\\text{pre, post}\\}$.\nThe provided data are:\n- $Y_{\\text{T, pre}} = 80$\n- $Y_{\\text{C, pre}} = 75$\n- $Y_{\\text{T, post}} = 70$\n- $Y_{\\text{C, post}} = 74$\n\nThe DiD estimator, which we denote as $\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}}$, is defined as the difference in the change in outcomes for the treated group and the change in outcomes for the control group.\n\nThe change in the outcome for the treated group (Country T) is:\n$$ \\Delta Y_{\\text{T}} = Y_{\\text{T, post}} - Y_{\\text{T, pre}} $$\n\nThe change in the outcome for the control group (Country C) is:\n$$ \\Delta Y_{\\text{C}} = Y_{\\text{C, post}} - Y_{\\text{C, pre}} $$\n\nThe DiD estimate is the difference between these two changes:\n$$ \\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = \\Delta Y_{\\text{T}} - \\Delta Y_{\\text{C}} = (Y_{\\text{T, post}} - Y_{\\text{T, pre}}) - (Y_{\\text{C, post}} - Y_{\\text{C, pre}}) $$\n\nThis can be understood as follows: The observed change in the treated group, $\\Delta Y_{\\text{T}}$, is the sum of the treatment effect and the secular trend (the change that would have happened anyway). The change in the control group, $\\Delta Y_{\\text{C}}$, provides an estimate of this secular trend, per the parallel trends assumption. Subtracting the estimated trend from the observed change in the treated group isolates the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT).\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the formula.\nFirst, calculate the change for Country T:\n$$ \\Delta Y_{\\text{T}} = 70 - 80 = -10 $$\nThis indicates that the infant mortality rate in Country T decreased by $10$ deaths per $1{,}000$ live births.\n\nNext, calculate the change for Country C:\n$$ \\Delta Y_{\\text{C}} = 74 - 75 = -1 $$\nThis indicates that the infant mortality rate in Country C decreased by $1$ death per $1{,}000$ live births. This change of $-1$ represents the secular trend that would have affected both countries in the absence of the DAH intervention.\n\nFinally, compute the DiD estimate by subtracting the change in the control group from the change in the treated group:\n$$ \\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{DiD}} = (-10) - (-1) = -10 + 1 = -9 $$\n\nThe estimate of the effect attributable to the bilateral DAH is a reduction of $9$ in the infant mortality rate (deaths per $1{,}000$ live births). The negative sign signifies that the intervention led to a decrease in the outcome variable.",
