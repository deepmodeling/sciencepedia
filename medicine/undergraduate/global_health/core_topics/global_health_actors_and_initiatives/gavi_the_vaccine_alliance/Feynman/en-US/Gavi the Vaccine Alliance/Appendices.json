This practice introduces the core methods used to quantify the value of a vaccination program. You will step into the role of a health analyst to calculate the health gains from a hypothetical vaccine introduction using the Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) framework, the gold standard for measuring disease burden. By working through this calculation (), you will see how epidemiological data on vaccine efficacy and disease incidence are translated into a powerful summary of lives saved and disabilities prevented.",

Over a $10$-year horizon, decision makers have estimated incremental program costs (in United States Dollars (USD), $2024$ prices) and health benefits measured as Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted, each relative to the current status quo (no new vaccine).

Let $D_{1,i}$ denote the number of unique infants who received the first dose of the Diphtheria–Tetanus–Pertussis vaccine (DTP1) in unit $i$, and let $D_{3,i}$ denote the number of unique infants who received the third dose (DTP3) in unit $i$ during the same period. By definition, the DTP1-to-DTP3 dropout proportion within a unit $i$ is the proportion of those who started the series (received DTP1) but did not complete it (did not receive DTP3), given by\n$$\n\\text{dropout}_{i} \\equiv \\frac{D_{1,i} - D_{3,i}}{D_{1,i}}.\n$$\nFor a country composed of multiple units, the national dropout proportion is defined analogously from first principles as the fraction of all infants nationally who started but did not complete the series, divided by all infants nationally who started the series. Aggregating counts across units using the linearity of summation,\n$$\n\\text{dropout}_{\\text{national}} \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\left(D_{1,i} - D_{3,i}\\right)}{\\sum_{i} D_{1,i}} = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{i} D_{1,i}\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i} D_{3,i}\\right)}{\\sum_{i} D_{1,i}} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{i} D_{3,i}}{\\sum_{i} D_{1,i}}.\n$$\nThis expression follows purely from the definition of a proportion and the additivity of counts across disjoint subpopulations; it is also equivalent to a DTP1-weighted average of unit-level dropout proportions.\n\nWe now compute the necessary aggregates from the provided data. Using Province Alpha, Province Beta, and Province Gamma:\n- Province Alpha: $D_{1,\\text{A}} = 52{,}000$, $D_{3,\\text{A}} = 45{,}500$.\n- Province Beta: $D_{1,\\text{B}} = 33{,}000$, $D_{3,\\text{B}} = 26{,}400$.\n- Province Gamma: $D_{1,\\text{G}} = 15{,}500$, $D_{3,\\text{G}} = 12{,}400$.\n\nAggregate DTP1:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} D_{1,i} = 52{,}000 + 33{,}000 + 15{,}500 = 100{,}500.\n$$\nAggregate DTP3:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} D_{3,i} = 45{,}500 + 26{,}400 + 12{,}400 = 84{,}300.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\text{dropout}_{\\text{national}} = 1 - \\frac{84{,}300}{100{,}500}.\n$$\nWe can simplify the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{84{,}300}{100{,}500} = \\frac{843}{1005} = \\frac{281}{335},\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\text{dropout}_{\\text{national}} = 1 - \\frac{281}{335} = \\frac{54}{335}.\n$$\nCompute the decimal value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\frac{54}{335} \\approx 0.1611940299\\ldots \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 0.1612.\n$$\n\nInterpretation by subnational unit to inform program continuity and missed opportunities for vaccination:\n- Province Alpha: The dropout count is $D_{1,\\text{A}} - D_{3,\\text{A}} = 52{,}000 - 45{,}500 = 6{,}500$, and the unit-level dropout proportion is $\\frac{6{,}500}{52{,}000} = 0.125$. This suggests comparatively stronger continuity between doses after initiation relative to the other provinces, though $6{,}500$ infants who started did not complete by DTP3 still represent missed follow-up opportunities.\n- Province Beta: The dropout count is $33{,}000 - 26{,}400 = 6{,}600$, with dropout proportion $\\frac{6{,}600}{33{,}000} = 0.200$. Despite a similar absolute number of infants not completing as Province Alpha, the higher proportion indicates greater attrition after series initiation, pointing to continuity gaps (for example, appointment adherence, session timing, or stock reliability).\n- Province Gamma: The dropout count is $15{,}500 - 12{,}400 = 3{,}100$, with dropout proportion $\\frac{3{,}100}{15{,}500} = 0.200$. Like Province Beta, this reflects higher proportional attrition among starters, consistent with missed opportunities at subsequent contacts. \n\nProgrammatically, the national dropout of approximately $0.1612$ conceals subnational heterogeneity: Provinces Beta and Gamma show higher proportional loss after initiation. For Missed Opportunities for Vaccination (MOV), the counts $6{,}600$ (Province Beta) and $3{,}100$ (Province Gamma) among starters who did not receive DTP3 flag potential missed opportunities at return visits or other service contacts. While a formal MOV rate requires visit-level assessment, these dropout patterns motivate targeted actions such as systematic defaulter tracing, adherence reminders, session scheduling adjustments, outreach in difficult-to-access areas, and supply chain checks in Provinces Beta and Gamma, while maintaining gains in Province Alpha.",
