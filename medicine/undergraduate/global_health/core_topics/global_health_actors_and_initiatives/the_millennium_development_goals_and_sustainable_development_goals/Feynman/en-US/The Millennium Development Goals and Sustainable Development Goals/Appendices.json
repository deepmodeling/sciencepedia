            "introduction": "Translating ambitious, long-term goals like those in the SDGs into actionable, year-by-year targets is a fundamental task in global health planning. This exercise  demonstrates how a simple but powerful exponential decay model can be used to calculate the constant annual rate of reduction needed to meet a major target, such as the Sustainable Development Goal for maternal mortality. Mastering this calculation provides a tool for assessing whether a country's progress is 'on track' to achieve its long-term vision.",

            "problem": "A country began the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) period in year $2015$ with a Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of maternal deaths per $100{,}000$ live births, of $MMR_{0} = 300$. The national target aligned with Sustainable Development Goal $3$ (ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages), specifically target $3.1$ (reduce the global MMR to less than $70$ per $100{,}000$ live births), is to reach $MMR_{2030} = 70$ by year $2030$. Assume that the decline in $MMR$ follows a continuous-time exponential process with a constant proportional reduction rate $r$ per year, so that for time $t$ measured in years from $2015$, the trajectory satisfies $MMR(t) = MMR_{0}\\,\\exp(-r t)$. Using the interval length $T = 15$ years from $2015$ to $2030$, derive $r$ from first principles based on the exponential model and compute its numerical value using the baseline $MMR_{0} = 300$ and target $MMR_{T} = 70$. Interpret $r$ as the annual percent reduction under exponential decline. Express your final answer as a decimal per year (no percentage sign) and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem states that the decline in the Maternal Mortality Ratio, $MMR$, follows a continuous-time exponential process. The model is given by the equation:\n$$MMR(t) = MMR_{0}\\,\\exp(-r t)$$\nwhere $t$ is the time in years measured from the start year $2015$, $MMR_0$ is the initial $MMR$ at $t=0$, and $r$ is the constant proportional reduction rate per year.\n\nThe given initial and target conditions are:\n- The initial year is $2015$, which corresponds to $t=0$. The initial $MMR$ is $MMR(0) = MMR_{0} = 300$ maternal deaths per $100{,}000$ live births.\n- The target year is $2030$. The time interval is $T = 2030 - 2015 = 15$ years. Thus, the target corresponds to $t=T=15$.\n- The target $MMR$ for the year $2030$ is $MMR(15) = MMR_{T} = 70$ maternal deaths per $100{,}000$ live births.\n\nOur objective is to derive the rate $r$ from these conditions. We substitute the known values into the model equation at time $t=T=15$:\n$$MMR(15) = MMR_{0}\\,\\exp(-r \\cdot 15)$$\n$$70 = 300\\,\\exp(-15r)$$\nTo solve for $r$, we first isolate the exponential term by dividing both sides by $MMR_0 = 300$:\n$$\\frac{70}{300} = \\exp(-15r)$$\nSimplifying the fraction on the left side gives:\n$$\\frac{7}{30} = \\exp(-15r)$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm, $\\ln$, of both sides to eliminate the exponential function. The natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function $\\exp(x)$.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{30}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-15r))$$\nUsing the identity $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, the right side simplifies to:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{30}\\right) = -15r$$\nNow, we can solve for $r$ by dividing by $-15$:\n$$r = -\\frac{1}{15}\\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{30}\\right)$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for $r$. We can use the logarithmic property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$ to express $r$ in a form that involves the logarithm of a number greater than $1$:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{15}\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{7}{30}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{15}\\ln\\left(\\frac{30}{7}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the derivation of $r$ from first principles as required. The rate $r$ is positive, which is consistent with a reduction or decay process.\n\nThe problem requires a numerical value for $r$, rounded to four significant figures. We compute the value using the derived expression:\n$$r = \\frac{1}{15}\\ln\\left(\\frac{30}{7}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{15}\\ln(4.285714...)$$\nUsing a calculator for precision:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{30}{7}\\right) \\approx 1.45528716$$\n$$r \\approx \\frac{1.45528716}{15} \\approx 0.097019144$$\nThe problem specifies rounding to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is $9$ in the hundredths place. The four significant figures are $9, 7, 0, 1$. The fifth significant digit is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant digit ($1$) to $2$.\nTherefore, the rounded value for $r$ is $0.09702$.\n\nThis value of $r$ represents the continuous proportional rate of reduction. An $r$ value of $0.09702$ corresponds to a continuous decline of approximately $9.702\\%$ per year. The problem asks for the answer as a decimal per year.",
