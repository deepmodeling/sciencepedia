For a patient whose predicted values are derived from validated reference equations such as the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI), consider the following post-bronchodilator measurements: predicted forced expiratory volume in one second ($FEV_1^{pred}$) is $2.8$ liters, predicted forced vital capacity ($FVC^{pred}$) is $3.5$ liters, observed $FEV_1$ is $1.4$ liters, and observed $FVC$ is $2.6$ liters. Assume airflow obstruction has been established independently, so GOLD severity staging can be applied based solely on $FEV_1$ percent predicted.\n\nUse the following foundational definitions and widely accepted classification facts:\n\n- Percent predicted for a spirometric variable $X$ is defined as the unitless ratio $X^{obs}/X^{pred}$, where $X^{obs}$ is the observed value and $X^{pred}$ is the predicted value for the individual’s demographic and anthropometric profile.\n- GOLD severity staging is categorized by $FEV_1$ percent predicted (unitless decimal) as follows: GOLD 1: $FEV_1\\% \\geq 0.80$, GOLD 2: $0.50 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.80$, GOLD 3: $0.30 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.50$, and GOLD 4: $FEV_1\\% < 0.30$.\n\nCompute the percent predicted values for $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, then determine the GOLD severity stage number based on the $FEV_1$ percent predicted.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that requires the calculation of spirometric parameters and the classification of COPD severity according to the GOLD guidelines.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Predicted forced expiratory volume in one second: $FEV_1^{pred} = 2.8$ liters\n- Predicted forced vital capacity: $FVC^{pred} = 3.5$ liters\n- Observed forced expiratory volume in one second: $FEV_1^{obs} = 1.4$ liters\n- Observed forced vital capacity: $FVC^{obs} = 2.6$ liters\n- Premise: Airflow obstruction has been established independently.\n- Definition 1: Percent predicted for a spirometric variable $X$ is the unitless ratio $X^{obs} / X^{pred}$.\n- Definition 2: GOLD severity staging criteria based on $FEV_1$ percent predicted ($FEV_1\\%$):\n  - GOLD 1: $FEV_1\\% \\geq 0.80$\n  - GOLD 2: $0.50 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.80$\n  - GOLD 3: $0.30 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.50$\n  - GOLD 4: $FEV_1\\% < 0.30$\n- Task: Compute $FEV_1\\%$ and $FVC\\%$ (rounded to four significant figures) and determine the numerical GOLD stage $G$.\n- Output Format: A row matrix $\\left[FEV_1\\%,\\,FVC\\%,\\,G\\right]$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on standard, internationally recognized clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of COPD (the GOLD strategy). The variables ($FEV_1$, $FVC$), definitions (percent predicted), and classification scheme are staples of respiratory medicine. The given values are physiologically plausible for a patient with moderate obstructive lung disease.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary numerical data and the explicit classification rules required to arrive at a unique solution.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Problem Solution**\n\nThe objective is to compute the percent predicted values for $FEV_1$ and $FVC$, and then to determine the GOLD severity stage. The final answer is to be presented as a row matrix containing these three values.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $FEV_1$ percent predicted, denoted as $FEV_1\\%$. According to the provided definition, this is the ratio of the observed value to the predicted value.\nThe given values are $FEV_1^{obs} = 1.4$ liters and $FEV_1^{pred} = 2.8$ liters.\n\n$$FEV_1\\% = \\frac{FEV_1^{obs}}{FEV_1^{pred}} = \\frac{1.4}{2.8}$$\n$$FEV_1\\% = 0.5$$\nThe problem requires this value to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. Thus, we write $0.5$ as $0.5000$.\n\n$$FEV_1\\% = 0.5000$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the $FVC$ percent predicted, denoted as $FVC\\%$.\nThe given values are $FVC^{obs} = 2.6$ liters and $FVC^{pred} = 3.5$ liters.\n\n$$FVC\\% = \\frac{FVC^{obs}}{FVC^{pred}} = \\frac{2.6}{3.5}$$\n$$FVC\\% \\approx 0.74285714...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n\n$$FVC\\% = 0.7429$$\n\nThird, we determine the GOLD severity stage number, $G$. This classification is based solely on the value of $FEV_1\\%$, which we calculated to be $0.5000$. We compare this value against the provided GOLD staging criteria:\n- GOLD 1: $FEV_1\\% \\geq 0.80$\n- GOLD 2: $0.50 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.80$\n- GOLD 3: $0.30 \\leq FEV_1\\% < 0.50$\n- GOLD 4: $FEV_1\\% < 0.30$\n\nOur calculated value $FEV_1\\% = 0.5000$ satisfies the condition for GOLD 2, as $0.50 \\leq 0.5000 < 0.80$. The numerical encoding for GOLD stage 2 is $G=2$.\n\nFinally, we assemble the results into the specified row matrix format $\\left[FEV_1\\%,\\,FVC\\%,\\,G\\right]$.\nSubstituting the calculated values, we get:\n$[0.5000, 0.7429, 2]$.",

The classification is a two-step process where exacerbation risk is assessed first.\n\n*   **Step 1: Assess Exacerbation Risk.** This step determines if the patient is high-risk (Group E).\n    *   **Group E (High Risk):** Patient has a history of $\\geq 2$ moderate exacerbations OR $\\geq 1$ severe exacerbation (leading to hospitalization) in the past year.\n*   **Step 2: Assess Symptom Burden (only for low-risk patients).** If the patient does not meet the criteria for Group E, their symptom burden is assessed to distinguish between Group A and Group B.\n    *   **Group B (More Symptoms):** CAT score $\\geq 10$ OR mMRC score $\\geq 2$.\n    *   **Group A (Fewer Symptoms):** CAT score $ 10$ AND mMRC score $ 2$.\n\n**2. Apply the Patient's Data**\n\nLet's apply the given patient data to this framework:\n*   **Patient Data:**\n    *   Exacerbation History: 2 moderate exacerbations in the past year.\n    *   Symptom Burden: CAT score = 18; mMRC score = 2.\n\n*   **Applying Step 1 (Exacerbation Risk):**\n    *   The criterion for Group E is $\\geq 2$ moderate exacerbations or $\\geq 1$ hospitalization.\n    *   The patient has had 2 moderate exacerbations.\n    *   Therefore, the patient meets the criteria for **Group E**.\n\nSince the patient is classified into Group E based on their high exacerbation risk, the assessment stops here. Their high symptom burden (CAT $\\geq 10$ and mMRC $\\geq 2$) is noted for management purposes but does not change their primary group classification from E to something else.\n\n**3. Conclusion and Option Selection**\n\nThe patient is classified into GOLD Group E. Reviewing the options:\n*   A. GOLD Group A: Incorrect. Patient has high symptoms and high exacerbation risk.\n*   B. GOLD Group B: Incorrect. Although the patient has high symptoms, their high exacerbation risk places them in Group E, which takes precedence.\n*   C. GOLD Group D: Incorrect. This group is part of the older ABCD classification system, which has been superseded by the ABE system specified in the problem.\n*   D. GOLD Group E: Correct. The patient's history of two moderate exacerbations in the last year places them in this high-risk category.\n\nThe final answer is D.",

The formulas for these metrics are standard in the field.

Calculation of YLD per $100{,}000$ persons**\n\nThe problem provides the parameters for an incidence-based calculation of $YLD$. The total $YLD$ is the product of the number of new (incident) cases, the disability weight of the condition, and the average duration of the disability. We are asked to find this value per $100{,}000$ persons, which we denote as $YLD_{100k}$.\n\nThe incidence rate, $I$, is given as the number of new cases per $100{,}000$ persons per year. For a representative population of $100{,}000$ persons, there will be $I$ new cases in the year. Each of these cases contributes an average of $DW \\times L_{\\text{dur}}$ years of disability over the course of the illness.\n\nThus, the total years lived with disability per $100{,}000$ people is the product of the number of incident cases per $100{,}000$ and the disability years per case:\n$$YLD_{100k} = I \\times DW \\times L_{\\text{dur}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $I = 120$ cases per $100{,}000$ persons\n- $DW = 0.17$\n- $L_{\\text{dur}} = 20$ years\n\n$$YLD_{100k} = 120 \\times 0.17 \\times 20$$\n$$YLD_{100k} = 120 \\times 3.4$$\n$$YLD_{100k} = 408$$\nThe units are years per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\n**2. Calculation of YLL per $100{,}000$ persons**\n\n$YLL$ is the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality. To calculate $YLL$ per $100{,}000$ persons ($YLL_{100k}$), we first need the mortality rate per $100{,}000$ persons, which we denote as $M_{100k}$.\n\nThe mortality rate per $100{,}000$ is calculated from the total number of deaths, $N$, and the total population, $P$:\n$$M_{100k} = \\frac{N}{P} \\times 100{,}000$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $N = 30{,}000$ deaths\n- $P = 40{,}000{,}000$ persons\n\n$$M_{100k} = \\frac{30{,}000}{40{,}000{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{3}{4{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{300}{4} = 75$$\nSo, there are $75$ deaths per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\nThe $YLL$ per $100{,}000$ persons is the mortality rate per $100{,}000$ multiplied by the average years of life lost per death, $L_{\\text{rem}}$:\n$$YLL_{100k} = M_{100k} \\times L_{\\text{rem}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated $M_{100k}$ and the given $L_{\\text{rem}}$:\n- $M_{100k} = 75$ deaths per $100{,}000$ persons\n- $L_{\\text{rem}} = 12$ years\n\n$$YLL_{100k} = 75 \\times 12$$\n$$YLL_{100k} = 900$$\nThe units are years per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\n**3. Calculation of DALY per $100{,}000$ persons**\n\nThe DALY is defined as the sum of $YLD$ and $YLL$. Therefore, the $DALY$ per $100{,}000$ persons ($DALY_{100k}$) is the sum of $YLD_{100k}$ and $YLL_{100k}$.\n$$DALY_{100k} = YLD_{100k} + YLL_{100k}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$DALY_{100k} = 408 + 900$$\n$$DALY_{100k} = 1308$$\nThe units are years per $100{,}000$ persons.\n\nThe final results are:\n- $YLD$ per $100{,}000$ persons = $408$ years.\n- $YLL$ per $100{,}000$ persons = $900$ years.\n- $DALY$ per $100{,}000$ persons = $1308$ years.",
