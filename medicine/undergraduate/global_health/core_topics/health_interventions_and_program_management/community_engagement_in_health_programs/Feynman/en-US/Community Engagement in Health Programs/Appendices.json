This exercise introduces a fundamental tool from psychometrics, Cronbach's alpha, which helps us assess the reliability of a measurement scale. By working through this problem, you will learn how to quantify the internal consistency of a survey designed to capture a complex concept like community engagement, ensuring your data is dependable for program evaluation.

            "problem": "A global health consortium is piloting a primary care initiative in which community engagement is measured by a composite scale comprising $k=5$ Likert-type items administered to households in three districts. The items are designed to be unidimensional and tau-equivalent, and they are standardized so that each item has variance $1$. Across the sample, the average inter-item correlation (the average of all off-diagonal item-item correlations) is $\\bar{r}=0.5$. The initiative intends to use the sum score to make decisions about resource allocation to community mobilization activities.\n\nStarting from core principles of Classical Test Theory, specifically the definition of reliability as the proportion of observed-score variance attributable to true-score variance, and using well-tested properties of variance for sums of correlated variables, derive an expression for the internal consistency reliability of the sum score (Cronbach’s alpha) in terms of $k$ and $\\bar{r}$ under the tau-equivalence and standardized-item assumptions. Then compute the reliability for the given values $k=5$ and $\\bar{r}=0.5$.\n\nExpress your final numerical answer for Cronbach’s alpha as an exact fraction. After computing the value, briefly interpret what this reliability implies for using the scale in program evaluation decisions focused on community engagement.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of Cronbach's alpha, a measure of internal consistency reliability, from the first principles of Classical Test Theory (CTT), followed by a calculation for specific given values and an interpretation of the result.\n\nAccording to CTT, the observed score for the $i$-th item, $X_i$, is the sum of a true score, $T_i$, and a random error component, $E_i$.\n$$ X_i = T_i + E_i $$\nThe reliability of a total score, $Y$, which is the sum of $k$ item scores ($Y = \\sum_{i=1}^k X_i$), is defined as the ratio of the true-score variance, $\\sigma_{T_Y}^2$, to the observed-score variance, $\\sigma_Y^2$. We denote this reliability as $\\alpha$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma_{T_Y}^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} $$\nHere, $T_Y = \\sum_{i=1}^k T_i$ is the true total score.\n\nOur derivation proceeds in two parts: first, we find an expression for the observed-score variance $\\sigma_Y^2$, and second, we find an expression for the true-score variance $\\sigma_{T_Y}^2$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Observed-Score Variance, $\\sigma_Y^2$\nThe variance of a sum of $k$ variables is the sum of their individual variances plus the sum of all their pairwise covariances.\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k X_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(X_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) $$\nThe problem states that all items are standardized, meaning the variance of each item is $1$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sigma_{X_i}^2 = 1 \\quad \\text{for all } i=1, \\dots, k $$\nTherefore, the sum of the item variances is simply $k$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(X_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^k 1 = k $$\nThe covariance between two items, $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$, is related to their correlation, $\\rho_{ij}$, by the formula $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_{X_i} \\sigma_{X_j}$. Since the items are standardized, their standard deviations are $\\sigma_{X_i} = \\sigma_{X_j} = 1$. Thus, the covariance is equal to the correlation: $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\rho_{ij}$.\nThe problem provides the average inter-item correlation, $\\bar{r}$. There are $k(k-1)$ unique off-diagonal pairs of items. The sum of all covariances is the number of pairs multiplied by the average covariance, which equals the average correlation $\\bar{r}$.\n$$ \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\nCombining these results, the total variance of the observed sum score is:\n$$ \\sigma_Y^2 = k + k(k-1)\\bar{r} $$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the True-Score Variance, $\\sigma_{T_Y}^2$\nThe variance of the true sum score, $T_Y = \\sum_{i=1}^k T_i$, is given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{T_Y}^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\text{Var}(T_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\text{Cov}(T_i, T_j) $$\nA fundamental assumption of CTT is that error terms are uncorrelated with true scores and with each other. This implies that the covariance between any two observed scores is equal to the covariance of their true scores:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = \\text{Cov}(T_i+E_i, T_j+E_j) = \\text{Cov}(T_i, T_j) $$\nThe problem states that the items are tau-equivalent. This means all items measure the same latent construct and have identical true-score variances. Let this common true-score variance be $\\sigma_T^2$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(T_i) = \\sigma_T^2 \\quad \\text{for all } i $$\nBecause all items measure the same unidimensional construct, their true scores are perfectly collinear, and the covariance between any two true scores is equal to their common variance:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(T_i, T_j) = \\sigma_T^2 \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j $$\nFrom the analysis in Part 1, we know $\\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$ is, on average, equal to $\\bar{r}$. Therefore, the common true-score variance under the given assumptions is equal to the average inter-item correlation.\n$$ \\sigma_T^2 = \\bar{r} $$\nWe can now calculate the total true-score variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{T_Y}^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sigma_T^2 + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\sigma_T^2 = k \\sigma_T^2 + k(k-1)\\sigma_T^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{T_Y}^2 = (k + k^2 - k)\\sigma_T^2 = k^2 \\sigma_T^2 $$\nSubstituting $\\sigma_T^2 = \\bar{r}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{T_Y}^2 = k^2 \\bar{r} $$\n\nPart 3: Derivation of Cronbach's Alpha and Calculation\nWe can now derive the expression for reliability, $\\alpha$, by substituting the expressions for $\\sigma_{T_Y}^2$ and $\\sigma_Y^2$ into the definition of reliability.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\sigma_{T_Y}^2}{\\sigma_Y^2} = \\frac{k^2 \\bar{r}}{k + k(k-1)\\bar{r}} $$\nTo simplify, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $k$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k \\bar{r}}{1 + (k-1)\\bar{r}} $$\nThis is the required general expression for Cronbach's alpha under the assumptions of tau-equivalence and standardized items.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $k=5$ and $\\bar{r}=0.5$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{5 \\times 0.5}{1 + (5-1) \\times 0.5} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + (4 \\times 0.5)} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + 2} = \\frac{2.5}{3} $$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we write $2.5$ as $5/2$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{5/2}{3} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n\nInterpretation of the Result:\nA reliability coefficient of $\\alpha = 5/6$, which is approximately $0.833$, is generally considered to reflect good internal consistency. This value indicates that about $83.3\\%$ of the variance in the sum scores for community engagement is attributable to true differences between households, while the remaining $16.7\\%$ is due to random measurement error. For the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation at the community level, this level of reliability is quite adequate. It suggests the scale can dependably distinguish between communities with higher and lower levels of engagement, thereby supporting its use in program evaluation and planning.",

            "problem": "A community health program in a low-resource setting is conducting a workshop to strengthen confidence in routine childhood immunization. Let $S$ denote the hypothesis that the vaccine used in the program is safe. Prior to the workshop, the facilitation team estimates the community’s aggregated prior probability of safety as $P(S)=0.6$. During the workshop, participants are exposed to new evidence $E$ from credible sources (for example, a nationally representative pharmacovigilance report reviewed by independent experts) that is more likely to be observed if the vaccine is safe than if it is not. The credibility of the new evidence is summarized by a likelihood ratio, defined as $LR=\\frac{P(E\\mid S)}{P(E\\mid \\neg S)}$, with $LR=3$.\n\nStarting from Bayes’ theorem and the definition of the likelihood ratio, derive an expression for the posterior probability $P(S\\mid E)$ in terms of the prior probability $P(S)$ and the likelihood ratio $LR$. Then evaluate this posterior for $P(S)=0.6$ and $LR=3$. Express your final numeric answer as an exact fraction.
