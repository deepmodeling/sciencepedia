The warehouse follows a continuous-review policy in which an order of fixed size is placed whenever the on-hand inventory position reaches a reorder point. Assume the classical deterministic conditions for the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ): constant demand rate, fixed setup cost per order, constant holding cost per unit per year, no stockouts, and instantaneous receipt of orders upon arrival. The annual demand is $D=120{,}000$ units/year, the fixed ordering cost is $S=50$ United States Dollars (USD)/order, and the annual holding cost is $H=1$ USD/unit/year.

This implies a constant demand rate, no stockouts, fixed and known costs, and instantaneous replenishment of inventory upon order arrival (though a non-zero lead time for placing the order is given).\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to scrutiny based on the established validation criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model, a foundational and scientifically sound principle in the field of operations research and inventory management. The assumptions listed are the standard idealizations for the basic model.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requires the minimization of a cost function for which a unique minimum is known to exist. All necessary parameters ($D$, $S$, $H$, $d$, $L$) are provided and are sufficient to determine the required quantities (EOQ, reorder point, and number of orders).\n-   **Objective**: The problem is formulated with clear, objective, and unambiguous quantitative data and instructions.\n-   **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The given data are internally consistent. The annual demand $D=120,000$ units is correctly related to the daily demand $d=400$ units and the number of operating days ($400 \\text{ units/day} \\times 300 \\text{ days/year} = 120,000 \\text{ units/year}$). The problem is self-contained.\n-   **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: While the assumptions of the EOQ model are an idealization of reality, they are explicitly stated for the purpose of applying the classical model. The numerical values are plausible within the given context.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe objective is to find the order quantity, denoted by $Q$, that minimizes the total annual cost associated with inventory management. The total annual cost, $TC(Q)$, is the sum of the annual ordering cost and the annual holding cost.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)**\n    The annual ordering cost is the number of orders placed per year multiplied by the fixed cost per order, $S$. The number of orders per year is the total annual demand, $D$, divided by the order quantity, $Q$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Annual Ordering Cost} = S \\times \\frac{D}{Q}\n    $$\n    The annual holding cost is the average inventory level multiplied by the annual cost to hold one unit in inventory, $H$. In the classic EOQ model, inventory depletes linearly from $Q$ to $0$, so the average inventory level is $\\frac{Q}{2}$.\n    $$\n    \\text{Annual Holding Cost} = H \\times \\frac{Q}{2}\n    $$\n    The total annual cost, $TC(Q)$, is the sum of these two costs:\n    $$\n    TC(Q) = \\frac{SD}{Q} + \\frac{HQ}{2}\n    $$\n    To find the order quantity $Q$ that minimizes $TC(Q)$, we must compute the first derivative of $TC(Q)$ with respect to $Q$ and set it to zero.\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(TC)}{dQ} = \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( \\frac{SD}{Q} + \\frac{HQ}{2} \\right) = -\\frac{SD}{Q^2} + \\frac{H}{2}\n    $$\n    Setting the derivative to zero to find the critical point:\n    $$\n    -\\frac{SD}{Q^2} + \\frac{H}{2} = 0 \\implies \\frac{H}{2} = \\frac{SD}{Q^2}\n    $$\n    Solving for $Q$:\n    $$\n    Q^2 = \\frac{2SD}{H}\n    $$\n    $$\n    Q = \\sqrt{\\frac{2SD}{H}}\n    $$\n    This optimal order quantity is the Economic Order Quantity, or $EOQ$. To confirm that this value of $Q$ corresponds to a minimum, we check the second derivative:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2(TC)}{dQ^2} = \\frac{d}{dQ} \\left( -\\frac{SD}{Q^2} + \\frac{H}{2} \\right) = \\frac{2SD}{Q^3}\n    $$\n    Since $S$, $D$, and $Q$ are all positive quantities, $\\frac{d^2(TC)}{dQ^2} > 0$, which confirms that the cost function is convex and the calculated $Q$ is a unique minimum.\n\n2.  **Calculation of the EOQ**\n    Substituting the given values $D=120,000$ units/year, $S=50$ USD/order, and $H=1$ USD/unit/year into the derived formula:\n    $$\n    EOQ = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 50 \\times 120,000}{1}} = \\sqrt{12,000,000} \\approx 3464.1016 \\text{ units}\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, the EOQ is $3464$ units.\n\n3.  **Calculation of the Reorder Point (ROP)**\n    The reorder point is the inventory level at which a new order should be placed. Since the lead time $L$ is constant and the demand rate $d$ is constant, the ROP is the demand during the lead time.\n    $$\n    ROP = d \\times L\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values $d=400$ units/day and $L=10$ days:\n    $$\n    ROP = 400 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{day}} \\times 10 \\text{ days} = 4000 \\text{ units}\n    $$\n    This value is exact. To express it with four significant figures as requested, it can be written in scientific notation as $4.000 \\times 10^3$ units.\n\n4.  **Calculation of the Annual Number of Orders**\n    The annual number of orders, $N$, is the total annual demand divided by the order quantity. For an optimal policy, we use the $EOQ$.\n    $$\n    N = \\frac{D}{EOQ}\n    $$\n    Using the unrounded value of the $EOQ$ for higher precision in the calculation:\n    $$\n    N = \\frac{120,000}{\\sqrt{12,000,000}} \\approx 34.641016 \\text{ orders/year}\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, the annual number of orders is $34.64$ orders/year.\n\nThe required values are:\n-   EOQ: $3464$ units\n-   Reorder point: $4000$ units\n-   Annual number of orders: $34.64$ orders/year",

The concepts and values ($p=0.05$, sampling from a shipment) are scientifically grounded and realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness and Consistency**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and assumptions to calculate a unique probability. The key assumption is that \"each batch’s quality status is independent of other batches\". This implies that for any batch, the probability of it being substandard is $p=0.05$, regardless of the status of any other batch. While the sampling of $3$ items from $10$ is \"without replacement,\" the independence of the underlying quality property for each item makes the problem solvable directly. The quality of the three chosen items are independent random variables. Thus, there is no contradiction.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using clear, objective, and quantitative language.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the probability that at least one substandard batch is detected among the $3$ batches selected for testing. Let this event be denoted by $A$.\n\nA direct calculation of $P(A)$ would require summing the probabilities of three mutually exclusive events: exactly one substandard batch, exactly two substandard batches, and exactly three substandard batches. A more direct approach is to use the complement rule, as suggested by the problem's constraints.\n\nThe complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that no substandard batches are detected. This is equivalent to the event that all $3$ tested batches are standard.\n\nLet $T_1$, $T_2$, and $T_3$ be the three batches randomly selected from the shipment for testing. Let $S_i$ be the event that batch $T_i$ is standard, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. The event $A^c$ can be expressed as the intersection of these events:\n$$A^c = S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap S_3$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the prevalence of substandard batches is $p = 0.05$. The QA test is perfect. Therefore, the probability that any single, randomly chosen batch is substandard is $p$. From the definition of probability for a complementary event, the probability that any single batch is standard is:\n$$P(S_i) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$$\n\nA crucial piece of information provided is that \"each batch’s quality status is independent of other batches.\" This implies that the quality status of any batch in the shipment is not influenced by the quality status of any other batch. Consequently, the events $S_1$, $S_2$, and $S_3$ are mutually independent.\n\nBy the definition of independence for three events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(S_1 \\cap S_2 \\cap S_3) = P(S_1) \\times P(S_2) \\times P(S_3)$$\n\nSubstituting the probability for a single batch to be standard:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) \\times (1 - p) = (1 - p)^3$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the value of $p = 0.05$:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - 0.05)^3 = (0.95)^3$$\n$$P(A^c) = 0.95 \\times 0.95 \\times 0.95 = 0.9025 \\times 0.95 = 0.857375$$\n\nFinally, using the complement rule, we find the probability of event $A$ (detecting at least one substandard batch):\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\n$$P(A) = 1 - 0.857375 = 0.142625$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $4$, $2$, and $6$. The fifth significant digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.1426$$\nThis entire derivation was constructed starting only from the definition of probability, the principle of independence of events, and the complement rule, as required. The shipment size $N=10$ and the \"without replacement\" sampling method do not alter the result because of the overriding assumption that the quality status of each individual batch is an independent probabilistic event.",
