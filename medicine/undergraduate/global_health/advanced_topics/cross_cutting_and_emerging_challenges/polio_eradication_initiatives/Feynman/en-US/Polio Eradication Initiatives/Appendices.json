This first exercise simulates the critical task of designing a Supplemental Immunization Activity (SIA), the cornerstone of polio interruption efforts.

            "problem": "A district is planning a series of Supplemental Immunization Activities (SIA) for polio using Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to interrupt transmission among children younger than five years. The district population is $1.60 \\times 10^{6}$, and the proportion of children younger than five years is $0.12$. Each SIA round aims to vaccinate a fraction $r$ of the eligible children, with $r = 0.90$. The per-dose probability that a vaccinated child becomes immune (vaccine take, that is, vaccine efficacy at the individual dose level) is $e = 0.60$. Assume independence of vaccination opportunities and vaccine take across rounds, and that once a child becomes immune, they remain immune. The program’s objective is to achieve at least $0.95$ immune coverage in the under-five population through repeated SIA rounds.\n\nOperational parameters are as follows: each vaccination team can vaccinate $120$ children per day, and each SIA round lasts $4$ days. Vaccine wastage (including spillage, cold-chain loss, and open-vial wastage) is $0.10$ per round, assumed to apply to doses procured.\n\nUsing foundational definitions of coverage as the probability of a child being vaccinated in a round, and vaccine efficacy as the probability that vaccination confers immunity in that round, derive the minimum number of SIA rounds required to achieve at least $0.95$ immune coverage. Then, compute:\n- the total number of OPV doses that must be procured across all rounds, accounting for wastage, and\n- the number of vaccination teams required per round to meet the per-round operational coverage.\n\nExpress the final dose quantity as a count of doses and the team requirement as a count of teams. Present your final answer as a row matrix containing two entries: the first entry is the total number of doses to procure across all rounds, and the second entry is the number of teams required per round. No rounding is required beyond exact arithmetic, and no units are to be included in the final boxed matrix.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in public health principles, well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of parameters for a solvable model.\n\nThe solution is derived through a sequence of calculations based on the provided data.\n\nFirst, we identify and list the given parameters, ensuring all mathematical entities are formatted in LaTeX.\n- Total district population: $N_{total} = 1.60 \\times 10^{6}$.\n- Proportion of children younger than five years: $p_{u5} = 0.12$.\n- Per-round vaccination coverage target: $r = 0.90$.\n- Per-dose vaccine efficacy (probability of immunization given vaccination): $e = 0.60$.\n- Target immune coverage in the under-five population: $I_{target} = 0.95$.\n- Children vaccinated per team per day: $C_{team\\_day} = 120$.\n- Duration of one SIA round: $T_{round} = 4$ days.\n- Vaccine wastage rate: $W = 0.10$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total number of children in the target age group (under five years).\n$$N_{u5} = N_{total} \\times p_{u5} = (1.60 \\times 10^{6}) \\times 0.12 = 192000$$\nThis is the total eligible population for the vaccination campaign.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum number of SIA rounds required. Let $k$ be the number of rounds. The problem states that the rounds are independent events. For a single child in a single round, the probability of being successfully vaccinated and becoming immune is the product of the coverage probability $r$ and the vaccine efficacy $e$.\n$$P(\\text{immune in one round}) = r \\times e = 0.90 \\times 0.60 = 0.54$$\nThe probability that a child does not become immune in one round is therefore:\n$$P(\\text{not immune in one round}) = 1 - (r \\times e) = 1 - 0.54 = 0.46$$\nAfter $k$ independent rounds, the probability that a child has not become immune is this single-round failure probability raised to the power of $k$.\n$$P(\\text{not immune after } k \\text{ rounds}) = (1 - re)^k = (0.46)^k$$\nThe immune coverage after $k$ rounds, $I_k$, is the complement of this probability.\n$$I_k = 1 - (1 - re)^k$$\nThe objective is to achieve an immune coverage of at least $0.95$. We set up the inequality:\n$$I_k \\ge I_{target}$$\n$$1 - (0.46)^k \\ge 0.95$$\nRearranging the inequality to solve for $k$:\n$$(0.46)^k \\le 1 - 0.95$$\n$$(0.46)^k \\le 0.05$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. As $\\ln(x)$ is an increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln((0.46)^k) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$k \\ln(0.46) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nSince $0.46 < 1$, $\\ln(0.46)$ is a negative number. Dividing by $\\ln(0.46)$ reverses the inequality sign.\n$$k \\ge \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(0.46)}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$k \\ge \\frac{-2.99573...}{-0.77653...} \\approx 3.8578...$$\nSince the number of rounds $k$ must be an integer, we must conduct a minimum of $4$ rounds.\n$$k = \\lceil 3.8578... \\rceil = 4$$\n\nWith $k=4$ established, we can compute the logistical requirements.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of children to be vaccinated in each round. This is the target coverage $r$ applied to the eligible population $N_{u5}$.\n$$N_{vacc\\_round} = N_{u5} \\times r = 192000 \\times 0.90 = 172800$$\nThis is the number of doses that must be successfully administered in each round.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of doses to be procured. The number of procured doses must account for the wastage rate $W=0.10$. If $D_{round}$ is the number of doses procured for a round, then the number of usable doses is $D_{round} \\times (1 - W)$. This must equal the number of children to be vaccinated.\n$$D_{round} \\times (1 - W) = N_{vacc\\_round}$$\n$$D_{round} = \\frac{N_{vacc\\_round}}{1 - W} = \\frac{172800}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{172800}{0.90} = 192000$$\nSo, $192000$ doses must be procured for each of the $4$ rounds.\nThe total number of doses to be procured across all rounds is:\n$$D_{total} = k \\times D_{round} = 4 \\times 192000 = 768000$$\n\nFinally, we compute the number of vaccination teams required per round. Each team vaccinates $C_{team\\_day} = 120$ children per day. A round lasts $T_{round} = 4$ days. Therefore, the capacity of one team per round is:\n$$C_{team\\_round} = C_{team\\_day} \\times T_{round} = 120 \\times 4 = 480 \\text{ children per team per round}$$\nThe number of teams required, $T_{teams}$, is the total number of children to be vaccinated per round divided by the capacity of a single team per round.\n$$T_{teams} = \\frac{N_{vacc\\_round}}{C_{team\\_round}} = \\frac{172800}{480} = 360$$\nThus, $360$ teams are required for each of the $4$ rounds.\n\nThe problem asks for a final answer as a row matrix containing two entries: the total number of OPV doses to procure across all rounds, and the number of vaccination teams required per round.\n1. Total doses procured: $768000$.\n2. Teams required per round: $360$.",

A post-campaign coverage survey used a two-stage cluster design with equal cluster sizes. In total, $40$ clusters were sampled, and within each cluster $15$ eligible children were assessed, yielding a total sample size of $600$. Among these, $546$ children were documented as vaccinated during the SIA. Based on prior surveys in similar settings, the design effect is taken as $D=2.4$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of several statistical measures related to a post-campaign coverage survey for a poliomyelitis supplementary immunization activity (SIA). The analysis must account for the complex survey design, specifically a two-stage cluster sample, by incorporating the provided design effect.\n\nFirst, we establish the given parameters from the problem statement:\n- Total number of clusters sampled: $k=40$.\n- Number of children sampled per cluster: $m=15$.\n- Total sample size: $n = k \\times m = 40 \\times 15 = 600$.\n- Number of children documented as vaccinated: $x=546$.\n- Design effect: $D=2.4$.\n- The desired confidence level for the confidence interval is $95\\%$, which corresponds to a z-score of $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$ from the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the point estimate of the true post-campaign coverage, denoted by $\\hat{p}$. This is the sample proportion of vaccinated children.\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{x}{n} = \\frac{546}{600} = 0.91\n$$\nThis value, $\\hat{p} = 0.91$, is the best single-value estimate of the true population coverage based on the sample data.\n\nNext, we must determine the standard error of this estimate. For a simple random sample (SRS) of a given size $n$, the standard error of a sample proportion $\\hat{p}$ would be calculated as:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}_{\\text{SRS}}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n$$\nHowever, the survey used a cluster design, not an SRS. The design effect, $D$, quantifies the impact of this complex design on the variance of the estimate compared to an SRS of the same size. The design effect is the ratio of the true variance under the complex design to the variance under an SRS:\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{cluster}}(\\hat{p})}{\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{SRS}}(\\hat{p})}\n$$\nTherefore, the design-adjusted variance is $\\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{adj}}(\\hat{p}) = D \\times \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{SRS}}(\\hat{p})$. The design-adjusted standard error, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p})$, is the square root of this adjusted variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{D \\times \\operatorname{Var}_{\\text{SRS}}(\\hat{p})} = \\sqrt{D \\times \\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{2.4 \\times \\frac{0.91(1 - 0.91)}{600}} = \\sqrt{2.4 \\times \\frac{0.91 \\times 0.09}{600}}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.4 \\times 0.0819}{600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.19656}{600}} = \\sqrt{0.0003276}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p}) \\approx 0.0180997\n$$\nSo, the design-adjusted standard error of the estimated coverage is approximately $0.0181$.\n\nWith the point estimate and its standard error, we can now construct a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for the true population coverage, $p$. The problem states that a large-sample normal approximation is appropriate. The formula for the CI is:\n$$\n\\text{CI} = \\hat{p} \\pm z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p})\n$$\nUsing $z_{0.025} = 1.96$:\n$$\n\\text{CI} = 0.91 \\pm 1.96 \\times 0.0180997\n$$\n$$\n\\text{CI} = 0.91 \\pm 0.0354754\n$$\nThe lower bound of the CI is $0.91 - 0.0354754 = 0.8745246$.\nThe upper bound of the CI is $0.91 + 0.0354754 = 0.9454754$.\nThus, the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true coverage is approximately ($0.875$, $0.945$).\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the design-adjusted margin of error (ME), which is defined as the half-width of the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval.\n$$\n\\text{ME} = z_{\\alpha/2} \\times \\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{p})\n$$\nUsing the values calculated previously:\n$$\n\\text{ME} = 1.96 \\times 0.0180997 \\approx 0.0354754\n$$\nThe problem requires this final value to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $5$, $4$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the preceding digit.\n$$\n\\text{ME} \\approx 0.03548\n$$\nThis is the final answer.",

The weight for each group is its proportion in the total cohort.\n\nLet $E$ represent the protection level (efficacy) for a subgroup against a specific endpoint (paralysis, $P$, or infection, $I$). The general formula for cohort-level effective protection, $EP$, is:\n$$EP = c_{\\mathrm{O}} E_{\\mathrm{O}} + c_{\\mathrm{I}} E_{\\mathrm{I}} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} E_{\\mathrm{B}} + c_{\\mathrm{N}} E_{\\mathrm{N}}$$\n\nWe must determine the protection level $E$ for each group and for each endpoint.\n\n1.  **Neither Group ($c_{\\mathrm{N}}$):** Individuals in this group receive no vaccine, so their vaccine-induced protection is zero.\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{N},P} = 0$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{N},I} = 0$$\n\n2.  **OPV-only Group ($c_{\\mathrm{O}}$):** The protection level is the efficacy of OPV.\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{O},P} = e_{\\mathrm{O},P} = 0.96$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{O},I} = e_{\\mathrm{O},I} = 0.82$$\n\n3.  **IPV-only Group ($c_{\\mathrm{I}}$):** The protection level is the efficacy of IPV.\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{I},P} = e_{\\mathrm{I},P} = 0.92$$\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{I},I} = e_{\\mathrm{I},I} = 0.35$$\n\n4.  **Both OPV and IPV Group ($c_{\\mathrm{B}}$):** The problem states that the vaccines act independently. If a vaccine has efficacy $e$, the probability it fails to protect is $1-e$. For two independent vaccines, the probability that both fail is the product of their individual failure probabilities. The combined protection (efficacy) is $1$ minus this combined failure probability.\n    For a generic endpoint $X \\in \\{P, I\\}$, the combined efficacy $E_{\\mathrm{B},X}$ is:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{B},X} = 1 - (1 - e_{\\mathrm{O},X})(1 - e_{\\mathrm{I},X})$$\n    This is equivalent to $e_{\\mathrm{O},X} + e_{\\mathrm{I},X} - e_{\\mathrm{O},X}e_{\\mathrm{I},X}$.\n\n    -   For paralysis ($P$):\n        $$E_{\\mathrm{B},P} = 1 - (1 - e_{\\mathrm{O},P})(1 - e_{\\mathrm{I},P}) = 1 - (1 - 0.96)(1 - 0.92) = 1 - (0.04)(0.08) = 1 - 0.0032 = 0.9968$$\n    -   For infection ($I$):\n        $$E_{\\mathrm{B},I} = 1 - (1 - e_{\\mathrm{O},I})(1 - e_{\\mathrm{I},I}) = 1 - (1 - 0.82)(1 - 0.35) = 1 - (0.18)(0.65) = 1 - 0.117 = 0.883$$\n\nNow, we can compute the cohort-level effective protection for each endpoint.\n\n**Cohort-level Effective Protection against Paralysis ($EP_P$):**\n$$EP_P = c_{\\mathrm{O}} E_{\\mathrm{O},P} + c_{\\mathrm{I}} E_{\\mathrm{I},P} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} E_{\\mathrm{B},P} + c_{\\mathrm{N}} E_{\\mathrm{N},P}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$EP_P = (0.38)(0.96) + (0.22)(0.92) + (0.28)(0.9968) + (0.12)(0)$$\n$$EP_P = 0.3648 + 0.2024 + 0.279104 + 0$$\n$$EP_P = 0.846304$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $EP_P = 0.8463$.\n\n**Cohort-level Effective Protection against Infection ($EP_I$):**\n$$EP_I = c_{\\mathrm{O}} E_{\\mathrm{O},I} + c_{\\mathrm{I}} E_{\\mathrm{I},I} + c_{\\mathrm{B}} E_{\\mathrm{B},I} + c_{\\mathrm{N}} E_{\\mathrm{N},I}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$EP_I = (0.38)(0.82) + (0.22)(0.35) + (0.28)(0.883) + (0.12)(0)$$\n$$EP_I = 0.3116 + 0.077 + 0.24724 + 0$$\n$$EP_I = 0.63584$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $EP_I = 0.6358$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the cohort-level effective protection against paralysis and infection, respectively.",
