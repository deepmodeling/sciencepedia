            "introduction": "A core element of health system resilience is absorptive capacity—the ability to handle a sudden surge in demand for services, such as during an epidemic or after a natural disaster. This practice uses a fundamental principle from queuing theory, Little's Law ($L = \\lambda W$), to translate abstract planning goals into concrete numbers. By applying this law, you will learn how to calculate the minimum hospital bed capacity required to withstand a specific demand surge while maintaining a safe occupancy level, a critical skill for hospital administrators and public health planners .",

            "problem": "A regional referral hospital in a low-resource setting is designing a resilience plan for its inpatient wards. Assume the inpatient system is stable in the long run, so that the time-average number of patients in the system equals the product of the long-run average arrival rate and the average time a patient spends in the system (Little’s Law). Suppose the current daily inflow is $\\lambda_{0} = 85$ patients per day and the average length of stay is $W = 7.4$ days. To withstand a sudden demand surge, planners require that, during a $0.30$ increase in demand relative to baseline, the steady-state bed occupancy remain strictly under $0.85$ of capacity.\n\nUsing the stability principle above together with the definition that occupancy equals the average number of inpatients divided by the total number of beds, determine the smallest integer bed capacity $B$ that ensures the occupancy is strictly less than $0.85$ during the surge. Express your final answer in beds. No rounding by significant figures is needed because a bed count must be an integer.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base is the long-run flow conservation for stable queues, commonly known as Little’s Law: the time-average number in the system equals the long-run average arrival rate multiplied by the average time spent in the system. Let $\\lambda_{0}$ denote the baseline arrival rate (patients per day) and $W$ denote the average length of stay (days). Then the baseline average number of inpatients (the average census) is\n$$\nL_{0} = \\lambda_{0} W.\n$$\nA $0.30$ demand surge scales the arrival rate to\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{surge}} = (1 + 0.30)\\,\\lambda_{0} = 1.3\\,\\lambda_{0}.\n$$\nUnder the same average length of stay $W$, the surge census is\n$$\nL_{\\text{surge}} = \\lambda_{\\text{surge}} W = (1.3\\,\\lambda_{0})\\,W.\n$$\nLet $B$ be the total bed capacity.

            "introduction": "Resilience is not only about having reserve capacity but also about being able to adapt when resources become constrained. This exercise explores the concept of adaptive capacity by modeling how a health system can maintain essential chronic care services during a shock that reduces in-person clinic availability.

            "problem": "A metropolitan primary care network aims to maintain continuity of chronic disease management during a sudden supply shock that reduces in-person clinic capacity. Before the shock, the network’s daily in-person clinic capacity was $200$ visits per day, with chronic care (for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes) comprising $60\\%$ of all visits and acute care comprising the remaining $40\\%$. During the shock, in-person clinic capacity is reduced by $30\\%$. Acute care is prioritized and must be maintained at its pre-shock daily volume because acute conditions are not deferrable.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is a well-posed, self-contained, and scientifically grounded problem in health systems resource allocation. It contains no logical contradictions, scientific impossibilities, or ambiguities that would preclude a unique, meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nLet us define the following variables to formalize the problem:\n- $C_{total, pre}$: Total pre-shock in-person clinic capacity per day.\n- $V_{chronic, pre}$: Daily chronic care visits pre-shock.\n- $V_{acute, pre}$: Daily acute care visits pre-shock.\n- $D_{chronic}$: Daily demand for chronic care visits.\n- $D_{acute}$: Daily demand for acute care visits.\n- $C_{total, post}$: Total post-shock in-person clinic capacity per day.\n- $C_{chronic, IP}$: Post-shock in-person capacity available for chronic care per day.\n- $V_{chronic, target}$: Target number of daily delivered chronic care visits post-shock.\n- $N_{tele}$: The minimal number of telemedicine slots required per day.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in a stepwise manner.\n\n1.  **Quantify pre-shock visit volumes and demand.**\n    The total pre-shock capacity is given as $C_{total, pre} = 200$ visits/day. Chronic care constitutes $60\\%$ of this volume, and acute care accounts for the remaining $40\\%$.\n    The number of daily pre-shock chronic care visits is:\n    $$V_{chronic, pre} = 0.60 \\times C_{total, pre} = 0.60 \\times 200 = 120 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n    The number of daily pre-shock acute care visits is:\n    $$V_{acute, pre} = 0.40 \\times C_{total, pre} = 0.40 \\times 200 = 80 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n    Per the problem's assumptions, demand is equal to pre-shock service volume and remains unchanged during the shock. Therefore, the daily demand for chronic and acute care is:\n    $$D_{chronic} = V_{chronic, pre} = 120 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n    $$D_{acute} = V_{acute, pre} = 80 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the post-shock in-person capacity.**\n    The shock reduces in-person capacity by $30\\%$. The remaining capacity is therefore $100\\% - 30\\% = 70\\%$ of the pre-shock level.\n    $$C_{total, post} = (1 - 0.30) \\times C_{total, pre} = 0.70 \\times 200 = 140 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n\n3.  **Allocate post-shock in-person capacity.**\n    Acute care is prioritized and must be maintained at its pre-shock volume. Since acute care cannot be delivered via telemedicine, these visits must be accommodated by the in-person capacity. The number of in-person slots allocated to acute care is:\n    $$V_{acute, post} = D_{acute} = 80 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n    This allocation is feasible as $V_{acute, post} < C_{total, post}$ (i.e., $80 < 140$). The remaining in-person capacity is available for chronic care.\n    $$C_{chronic, IP} = C_{total, post} - V_{acute, post} = 140 - 80 = 60 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n    Thus, a maximum of $60$ chronic care visits can be delivered in-person each day after the shock.\n\n4.  **Determine the total number of chronic care visits to be delivered.**\n    The objective is to achieve a coverage ratio of $95\\%$ for chronic care. The coverage ratio is defined as $C = \\frac{\\text{delivered visits}}{\\text{required visits}}$. The target number of delivered chronic care visits, $V_{chronic, target}$, is therefore $95\\%$ of the chronic care demand.\n    $$V_{chronic, target} = 0.95 \\times D_{chronic} = 0.95 \\times 120$$\n    Calculation yields:\n    $$V_{chronic, target} = 114 \\text{ visits/day}$$\n\n5.  **Calculate the required number of telemedicine slots.**\n    The total number of delivered chronic care visits is the sum of those delivered in-person and those delivered via telemedicine. Let $N_{tele}$ be the required number of telemedicine slots. Since each slot perfectly and effectively delivers one visit, $N_{tele}$ is also the number of telemedicine visits.\n    $$V_{chronic, target} = C_{chronic, IP} + N_{tele}$$\n    We can now solve for $N_{tele}$ by substituting the values derived in the previous steps.\n    $$114 = 60 + N_{tele}$$\n    $$N_{tele} = 114 - 60 = 54$$\n    Therefore, $54$ telemedicine slots are required per day to meet the specified chronic care coverage target. The result is a whole number, as requested.",

In health economics and decision theory, a rational investment with uncertain benefits is undertaken when the expected net benefit, defined as the expected benefit minus all relevant costs (including opportunity costs), is nonnegative. Using this fundamental base and the definition of expected value, proceed as follows:\n\n- Let the expected avoided loss from disruptions conferred by redundancy be denoted by $L$.\n- Let the unit cost of establishing and operating the redundancy be denoted by $c_{r}$.\n- Let the opportunity cost of unused capacity (forgone alternative uses) be denoted by $c_{o}$.\n\nPart A (derivation): Starting from the principle that a rational decision requires the expected net benefit to be nonnegative, and using the definition of expected value for losses avoided, derive a symbolic decision condition that characterizes when investing in redundancy is rational in terms of $L$, $c_{r}$, and $c_{o}$.\n\nPart B (application): Consider the following scientifically plausible scenario for the same health system.

It is grounded in the established principles of decision theory and health economics, specifically cost-benefit analysis and the calculation of expected value. The scenario provided is a plausible application within the field of health systems resilience. The data are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to derive a solution.\n\nPart A: Derivation of the Symbolic Decision Condition\n\nThe fundamental principle for a rational investment is that the expected net benefit must be nonnegative. Let the expected net benefit be denoted by $B_{net}$. The condition is:\n$$B_{net} \\ge 0$$\nThe problem defines the expected net benefit as the expected benefit minus all relevant costs. The expected benefit is given as the expected avoided loss, $L$. The relevant costs are the sum of the cost of establishing and operating the redundancy, $c_r$, and the opportunity cost of unused capacity, $c_o$.\n\nThe total cost, $C_{total}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{total} = c_r + c_o$$\nThe expected net benefit can be written as:\n$$B_{net} = L - C_{total} = L - (c_r + c_o)$$\nSubstituting this expression into the core principle yields the symbolic decision condition for making a rational investment:\n$$L - (c_r + c_o) \\ge 0$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to state that the expected avoided loss must be greater than or equal to the total costs:\n$$L \\ge c_r + c_o$$\nThis is the symbolic decision condition that must be satisfied for the investment in redundancy to be considered rational.\n\nPart B: Application and Numerical Calculation\n\nThis part requires the application of the derived framework to a specific numerical scenario. The goal is to compute the net expected benefit, $B$, which the problem defines as $B = L - (c_r + c_o)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected avoided loss, $L$. For a set of discrete events, the expected value is the sum of the products of each outcome's value and its probability. In this context, the outcomes are the avoided losses, $\\Delta_i$, from different types of disruptions, and $p_i$ are their respective probabilities.\n$$L = \\sum_{i} p_i \\Delta_i$$\nThe problem provides data for two types of disruptions:\n1.  A moderate supply-chain delay with probability $p_1 = 0.35$ and an avoided loss of $\\Delta_1 = 3.4 \\times 10^6$ USD.\n2.  A severe power outage with probability $p_2 = 0.12$ and an avoided loss of $\\Delta_2 = 19.5 \\times 10^6$ USD.\n\nAssuming these are the only relevant events contributing to the expected avoided loss, we calculate $L$ as:\n$$L = (p_1 \\times \\Delta_1) + (p_2 \\times \\Delta_2)$$\n$$L = (0.35 \\times 3.4 \\times 10^6) + (0.12 \\times 19.5 \\times 10^6)$$\n$$L = 1,190,000 + 2,340,000$$\n$$L = 3,530,000 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total annual cost, $C_{total}$, by summing the given costs:\n$$c_r = 2.375 \\times 10^6 \\text{ USD}$$\n$$c_o = 0.935 \\times 10^6 \\text{ USD}$$\n$$C_{total} = c_r + c_o = 2.375 \\times 10^6 + 0.935 \\times 10^6$$\n$$C_{total} = 3,310,000 \\text{ USD}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the net expected benefit, $B$:\n$$B = L - C_{total}$$\n$$B = 3,530,000 - 3,310,000$$\n$$B = 220,000 \\text{ USD}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
