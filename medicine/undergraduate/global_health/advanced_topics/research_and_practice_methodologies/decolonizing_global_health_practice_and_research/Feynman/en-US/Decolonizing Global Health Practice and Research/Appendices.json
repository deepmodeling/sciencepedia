This means $A_i = k S_i$ for some constant of proportionality $k$.\n        *   The total budget is $B = \\sum A_i$.\n        *   $B = \\sum (k S_i) = k \\sum S_i$.\n        *   Therefore, the constant of proportionality is $k = \\frac{B}{\\sum S_i}$.\n        *   The allocation for each priority is $A_i = \\frac{B}{\\sum S_j} S_i$. This is the mathematical formalization of \"proportional allocation\". The fraction of the budget allocated to priority $i$ is $\\frac{S_i}{\\sum_j S_j}$.\n\n    *   **Step 3: Calculate the total combined score.**\n        *   $\\sum S_i = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.70 + 0.76 + 0.72 = 2.18$.\n\n    *   **Step 4: Calculate the allocations ($A_i$).**\n        *   Total budget $B = 5,000,000$.\n        *   $A_1 = B \\times \\frac{S_1}{\\sum S_j} = 5,000,000 \\times \\frac{0.70}{2.18}$\n        *   $A_2 = B \\times \\frac{S_2}{\\sum S_j} = 5,000,000 \\times \\frac{0.76}{2.18}$\n        *   $A_3 = B \\times \\frac{S_3}{\\sum S_j} = 5,000,000 \\times \\frac{0.72}{2.18}$\n\n    *   **Step 5: Perform the numerical calculations.**\n        *   $A_1 = 5,000,000 \\times (0.70 / 2.18) \\approx 5,000,000 \\times 0.3211009... = 1,605,504.587...$\n        *   $A_2 = 5,000,000 \\times (0.76 / 2.18) \\approx 5,000,000 \\times 0.3486238... = 1,743,119.266...$\n        *   $A_3 = 5,000,000 \\times (0.72 / 2.18) \\approx 5,000,000 \\times 0.3302752... = 1,651,376.146...$\n        *   Let's check the sum: $1605504.587 + 1743119.266 + 1651376.146 = 4999999.999 \\approx 5,000,000$. The calculation is correct.\n\n    *   **Step 6: Round the results to three significant figures.**\n        *   $A_1 = 1,605,504.587...$\n            *   Significant figures are 1, 6, 0. The next digit is 5, so round up.\n            *   $A_1 \\approx 1,610,000$.\n        *   $A_2 = 1,743,119.266...$\n            *   Significant figures are 1, 7, 4. The next digit is 3, so round down.\n            *   $A_2 \\approx 1,740,000$.\n        *   $A_3 = 1,651,376.146...$\n            *   Significant figures are 1, 6, 5. The next digit is 1, so round down.\n            *   $A_3 \\approx 1,650,000$.\n\n    *   **Step 7: Format the final answer.**\n        *   The final answer should be the three rounded amounts.\n        *   The format is a row matrix: `\\begin{pmatrix} 1610000 & 1740000 & 1650000 \\end{pmatrix}`.\n        *   I will double check the rounding rule for significant figures. \"1,605,504.587...\". The first three significant figures are '1', '6', and '0'. The fourth significant digit is '5', so the third digit '0' is rounded up to '1'. The rest of the digits to the right become zeros. So, 1,610,000. Correct.\n        *   For \"1,743,119.266...\". The first three significant figures are '1', '7', '4'. The fourth significant digit is '3' (<5), so the '4' is kept as is. The rest of the digits to the right become zeros. So, 1,740,000. Correct.\n        *   For \"1,651,376.146...\". The first three significant figures are '1', '6', '5'. The fourth significant digit is '1' (<5), so the '5' is kept as is. The rest of the digits to the right become zeros. So, 1,650,000. Correct.\n        *   The problem asks to express the allocation in USD, but the final answer box should not contain units. This is consistent with the instructions.\n        *   The question also asks for the final answer to be the \"three rounded amounts only\". A matrix seems appropriate as per the instructions.\n        *   Let's check if the sum of rounded values is close to the total budget. $1,610,000 + 1,740,000 + 1,650,000 = 5,000,000$. It sums perfectly. This is a good sign that the rounding is consistent and acceptable. It happens because the unrounded sum was also near a round number (`4999999.999...`). The sum of rounding errors is $(1,610,000 - 1,605,504.587) + (1,740,000 - 1,743,119.266) + (1,650,000 - 1,651,376.146) = 4495.413 - 3119.266 - 1376.146 = 4495.413 - 4495.412 = 0.001$. Yes, the rounding is consistent.\n        *   The problem does not explicitly demand scientific notation, but the global rules do. I will use the scientific notation format. It's more precise. No, the global rule states \"Write in standard form...\" which is one of the formatting rules. Let's re-read it. \"The Final Answer Only... Exact Form... No Units\". \"LaTeX Formatting Rules: ... Scientific notation: Write in standard form a x 10^b ...\". It's a rule for *how* to write scientific notation if one chooses to use it, not a mandate to always use it. The problem's request to \"Express each allocation in United States dollars (USD)\" and provide \"the three rounded amounts\" might imply the standard currency format is more appropriate, e.g., `$1,610,000`. Writing `1.61 \\times 10^6` dollars is less common. Let me think about clarity. `1610000` is unambiguous. It correctly represents the value rounded to 3 sig figs. The ambiguity of trailing zeros is mostly a problem for numbers with decimal points. E.g., is \"1600.\" 2, 3, or 4 sig figs? But for \"1610000\", it's generally understood that it's rounded to the nearest ten thousand. I will stick to the integer representation `1610000`, `1740000`, `1650000`. This feels more aligned with \"Express each allocation in United States dollars\". You don't write a check for $1.61 \\times 10^6$ dollars. You write it for $1,610,000.\n        *   So, the final plan is:\n            1.  Validate (valid).\n            2.  Calculate $S_i$.\n            3.  Calculate $A_i$ unrounded.\n            4.  Round $A_i$ to 3 significant figures.\n            5.  Present the results in the solution.\n            6.  Put the three rounded integer values in the final answer matrix.\n        *   This seems robust and compliant with all instructions.\n\nLet's double-check the calculations.\n$S_1 = 0.6 \\times 0.9 + 0.4 \\times 0.4 = 0.54 + 0.16 = 0.70$. Correct.\n$S_2 = 0.6 \\times 0.8 + 0.4 \\times 0.7 = 0.48 + 0.28 = 0.76$. Correct.\n$S_3 = 0.6 \\times 0.6 + 0.4 \\times 0.9 = 0.36 + 0.36 = 0.72$. Correct.\nSum $S = 0.70 + 0.76 + 0.72 = 2.18$.

A decolonizing approach emphasizes sustainability by considering the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) from the outset.

Using only the definitions that (i) a budget partitioned into disjoint line items must sum to the total and (ii) a proportion is a fraction of the whole, compute the annual maintenance budget implied by this earmark. Then, using first principles of decolonizing global health practice—specifically Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), local capacity strengthening, and the avoidance of technology dumping—provide a concise mechanistic rationale for why this earmark reduces the risk that donated equipment becomes idle. Express the maintenance budget as a single exact number in United States dollars (USD). Do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. It presents a straightforward calculation based on elementary principles of proportions, combined with a request for a rationale grounded in established concepts from global health program management.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Maintenance Budget**\n\nThe problem provides the following givens:\n- The total award amount, $A = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$ United States dollars (USD).\n- The fixed fraction of the award to be used for preventive maintenance, $p = 0.30$.\n\nThe problem defines a budget as a partition into disjoint line items that must sum to the total. Let $B_{maint}$ be the budget for maintenance and $B_{equip}$ be the budget for equipment purchase. The total award $A$ is partitioned as:\n$$A = B_{equip} + B_{maint}$$\n\nThe problem also states that a proportion is a fraction of the whole. The maintenance budget, $B_{maint}$, is specified as a proportion $p$ of the total award $A$. Therefore, we can express $B_{maint}$ as:\n$$B_{maint} = p \\times A$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$B_{maint} = 0.30 \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{6} \\text{ USD})$$\n$$B_{maint} = 360000 \\text{ USD}$$\n\n**Part 2: Mechanistic Rationale for Reducing Equipment Idleness**\n\nThe earmarking of a significant fraction of the initial award for maintenance mechanistically reduces the risk of donated equipment becoming idle by directly addressing common failure points identified within decolonizing global health practice. The rationale is based on the following interconnected principles:\n\n1.  **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Historically, many equipment donations have focused solely on the upfront capital cost of the hardware. This practice ignores the TCO, which encompasses all costs incurred over the asset's lifecycle, including installation, operation, consumables, training, maintenance, and eventual disposal. Idle equipment is often a direct consequence of \"unfunded mandates\" where a recipient is given a machine but not the recurrent funds needed to operate and maintain it. By ring-fencing $p = 0.30$ of the award, the policy forces both the donor and the recipient to acknowledge and pre-fund a critical component of the TCO from the outset. This ensures that when the equipment arrives, a dedicated budget already exists for service contracts, spare parts, and calibration, which are essential for keeping the equipment functional beyond its initial use.\n\n2.  **Local Capacity Strengthening:** The maintenance earmark is not merely for parts; it explicitly includes \"technician training.\" This directly counters a neocolonial dependency model where sophisticated equipment requires intermittent and expensive support from foreign experts. By investing in local technicians, the grant builds a sustainable, in-country human resource base capable of performing routine maintenance and troubleshooting. This local capacity is a primary determinant of equipment uptime. When a machine fails, a trained local technician can address the issue promptly, rather than waiting weeks or months for external support, a delay during which the equipment sits idle. This strengthens the autonomy and resilience of the local health system.\n\n3.  **Avoidance of Technology Dumping:** \"Technology dumping\" refers to the donation of equipment that is inappropriate for the local context, technologically obsolete, or lacks a viable supply chain for spare parts and consumables. Such donations often serve the donor's interests (e.g., offloading old inventory, generating positive publicity) more than the recipient's needs. The mandatory $30\\%$ maintenance earmark acts as a powerful structural deterrent against this practice. It forces a due diligence process: if a sustainable, cost-effective, one-year maintenance plan cannot be formulated for a piece of equipment within this budget, that equipment is implicitly disqualified from being purchased. This mechanism filters out devices with exorbitant or non-existent support infrastructure, thereby preventing the acquisition of equipment that is predisposed to becoming idle shortly after installation. It aligns the choice of technology with the practical realities of long-term support in the recipient's environment.\n\nIn summary, the earmark mechanistically couples the act of acquisition with the means of sustainment. By pre-allocating funds based on TCO principles, investing in local human capacity, and creating a financial barrier to the dumping of inappropriate technology, the policy directly mitigates the primary drivers of equipment idleness in resource-limited settings.",
