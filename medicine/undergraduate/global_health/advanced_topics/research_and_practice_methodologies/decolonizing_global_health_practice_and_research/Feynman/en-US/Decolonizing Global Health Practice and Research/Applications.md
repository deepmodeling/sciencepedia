## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having journeyed through the core principles that animate the call to decolonize [global health](@entry_id:902571), we might be left with a sense of righteous inspiration. But as with any great principle in science, the real excitement—the real genius—is not in the statement of the idea, but in its application. It is one thing to say "let us be equitable," and quite another to build a machine, a system, a contract, or even a simple equation that makes equity real and measurable. How do we translate these grand ideals into the nuts and bolts of daily work? This is where the adventure truly begins. We will now explore how the principles of decolonizing practice are not just philosophical stances, but powerful tools for design, analysis, and innovation across a surprising array of fields.

### The Architecture of Equitable Partnerships

For decades, much of [global health](@entry_id:902571) research followed a blueprint that was, if we are honest, quite colonial in its structure. Researchers from wealthy nations would arrive in lower-income countries, conduct studies with the help of local staff, collect data, and leave to publish their findings. The historical echoes of this model, seen in early, ethically fraught studies like the Puerto Rico contraceptive trials, reveal a deep imbalance in power, benefit, and respect .

How do we design a better architecture? The first, most fundamental question is: *who is in charge?* A decolonized approach insists on moving from a model of mere consultation to one of genuine partnership. It is the difference between asking a community to "advise" on a research plan that has already been decided, and building a "joint governance committee" where community representatives are co-principal investigators with shared budget authority and even the power to veto a decision . This is the essence of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), where the community is not a subject of study, but a co-creator of knowledge.

This principle of co-creation extends beyond the initial setup. In a truly collaborative process, known as co-design, the plan is not fixed from the start. Instead, it evolves through iterative cycles of testing, reflection, and adaptation. The partners—community and researchers alike—repeatedly test prototypes in the field, reflect on what works, and have the shared authority to change even core elements of the intervention . This is a living partnership, not a rigid, top-down implementation.

We can even develop a quantitative language to describe the "fairness" of a partnership's architecture. Imagine we could score a collaboration along three key dimensions: Decision rights ($D$), Risk-sharing ($R$), and Value co-creation ($V$). A purely extractive model is one where the local partner has few decision rights ($D_L$ is low), bears most of the operational risk ($R_L$ is high), and receives a tiny fraction of the long-term value, like intellectual property or authorship ($V_L$ is low). An equitable partnership, by contrast, would strive for balance, a state where $D_L \approx D_G$, $R_L \approx R_G$, and $V_L \approx V_G$, with the shares of value for the local partner coming in the form of durable investments in infrastructure and capacity, not just temporary salaries . By building such a "blueprint," we can move from hoping for fairness to engineering it directly into the structure of our collaborations .

### Following the Money: The Economics of Justice

There is an old saying: if you want to understand power, follow the money. The principles of decolonizing [global health](@entry_id:902571) find some of their most powerful applications in the seemingly mundane world of budgets, contracts, and procurement.

Consider the idea of "capacity strengthening." For years, this often meant sending promising individuals from lower-income countries for training in the Global North. While well-intentioned, this "Externship Pipeline" model often leads to "brain drain," with low retention rates of trainees in their home countries. A decolonized approach reframes capacity strengthening as a structural investment. Instead of spending the majority of a budget on outbound training, a "Mutual Health Partnership" would invest heavily in local infrastructure—laboratories, data systems—and in local leadership development and retention incentives. The results are striking: such a model can dramatically increase the retention of trained staff and ensure they move into decision-making roles within their own health systems, creating durable, self-sustaining capacity .

This economic lens can be applied to every line item. Take procurement. A large humanitarian response might have a budget of $50$ million. Where are the supplies—the medicines, the tents, the tools—purchased? A typical model sources internationally. But what if we created a "Decolonial Procurement Index" (DPI) that assigns the highest value to local sourcing, a medium value to regional sourcing, and zero value to international sourcing? By setting a target to improve this index, an organization can be mathematically guided to shift its supply chain, ensuring that a larger portion of its budget strengthens the local and regional economy .

The principle of economic justice extends all the way down to the individual. It is common for community researchers in a low-income setting to be paid a fraction of what their counterparts from a high-income country earn for the same work. A simple argument is made about local pay scales. But is this truly fair? We can build a more just model. We can, for instance, demand that compensation be equal after adjusting for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)—what a dollar can actually buy in each location. We can even add a hazard weighting to account for differential risks faced by on-the-ground staff. By setting the PPP- and hazard-adjusted remunerations to be equal, we can derive a precise "uplift factor" $u$ that must be applied to the local pay rate to achieve true economic parity. Justice, in this case, becomes a solvable equation .

### Forging New Rulers: The Art of Measuring Inequity

One of the greatest beauties in science is the invention of a new instrument—a new way to see what was previously invisible. To tackle the subtle and often unconscious biases that perpetuate colonial dynamics, we need new kinds of measuring sticks, new "rulers" to detect and quantify inequity.

Let's start with something simple: authorship on a scientific paper. Who gets the credit? We can create a simple but powerful "Authorship Equity Index" (AEI) by assigning contribution weights to each author and then calculating the total share of contribution held by local authors. This index can be checked against an institutional target, turning a vague goal of "fair authorship" into a clear, auditable metric .

We can get more sophisticated. Consider the power to set the research agenda itself. Let's say institutions from high-income countries hold a share of the votes, $p_H$, and partner-country institutions hold a share $p_L$. How can we measure the "asymmetry" of this power? We can lay down a few simple, logical requirements: the index should be zero when power is equal ($p_H=p_L$), it should depend only on the ratio of power $r=p_H/p_L$, and it should add up in a consistent way. Remarkably, these simple axioms lead us to a unique mathematical form for the index: the natural logarithm of the power ratio, $G = \ln(p_H / p_L)$ . Here, we have derived a rigorous, theoretically-grounded tool to measure power itself.

These tools can help us detect even more insidious biases. Epistemic injustice is the idea that the world systematically discounts the knowledge and credibility of people from marginalized groups. Can we measure this? Imagine a funding agency reviews matched proposals on identical topics, some led by local investigators and some by external ones. If the average score for local investigators, $\bar{s}_L$, is consistently lower than for external ones, $\bar{s}_E$, we might suspect bias. We can define a "Testimonial Discount Index" as the proportional shortfall: $TDI = 1 - \frac{\bar{s}_L}{\bar{s}_E}$. This simple index gives us a number, a measurement of the potential bias in the system, allowing us to see and address a subtle but profound injustice .

This mode of thinking is essential as we enter an age of artificial intelligence. An AI model trained on biased historical data can learn to reproduce and even amplify structural inequities. Consider an AI system designed to triage patients for specialist care. If it recommends referrals for a marginalized group at a much lower rate than for a reference group, even when the underlying [disease prevalence](@entry_id:916551) is the same, it may be creating a new, high-tech barrier to care. We can measure this using a "disparate impact ratio" and check it against established fairness thresholds, such as the "four-fifths rule," which flags a potential issue if the selection rate for the marginalized group is less than $0.8$ times the rate for the reference group . The principles of equity must be programmed into our new machines just as they must be written into our research contracts.

### A Principle for All Seasons: Unifying Connections

The beauty of a deep principle is its unifying power. The ideas of decolonizing practice are not confined to the ivory tower of academic research; they resonate across all fields of global engagement.

In the chaotic world of humanitarian aid, for example, the same dynamics are at play. An international organization might fly in to manage a disaster response, hiring a local organization as a subcontractor to do the "last-mile delivery." A decolonized approach, often called "localization," asks a different set of questions: Who leads the needs assessment? Who controls procurement and the supply chain? Who makes the final call on security? True localization means shifting these core decision rights to local actors, transforming them from implementers into leaders of the response in their own communities . It is the same architectural principle of partnership, applied under the most demanding of circumstances.

Finally, these principles come home to us, in our own institutions. As a student of [global health](@entry_id:902571), the curriculum you are taught is itself a product of a certain history and a certain set of power relations. Whose voices are you reading? Whose scholarship is presented as authoritative? We can apply the same quantitative rigor here. We can measure the representation proportion—the fraction of assigned readings authored by scholars from the regions being studied. We can then set a target, for example, that at least half the curriculum should reflect voices from those regions, and calculate exactly how many changes are needed to meet that goal . In doing so, the work of decolonization is no longer something happening "out there"—it is a practical task right here, in the construction of our own knowledge.

From designing contracts to writing budgets, from auditing algorithms to building a syllabus, the principles of decolonizing [global health](@entry_id:902571) provide a unified framework for action. It is a creative, rigorous, and profoundly practical endeavor that invites us to be better scientists, more thoughtful partners, and more just global citizens. It is, at its heart, the simple, beautiful, and challenging work of seeing the world as it is, and then redesigning it to be what it ought to be.
