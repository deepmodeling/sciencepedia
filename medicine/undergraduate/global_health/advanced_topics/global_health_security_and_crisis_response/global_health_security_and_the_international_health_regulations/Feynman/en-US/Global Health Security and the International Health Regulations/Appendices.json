            "problem": "A State Party to the International Health Regulations (IHR) maintains a national early warning surveillance system to detect outbreaks of novel respiratory infections. Consider an outbreak that generates exactly $n$ infected individuals during a defined case-finding window mandated for reporting. For each infected individual, the following hold:\n\n- With probability $q$, the surveillance system successfully obtains a diagnostic specimen from the individual during the window (sampling coverage).\n- Conditional on being sampled, the laboratory diagnostic assay has sensitivity $s$, meaning the probability of yielding a true positive result given true infection is $s$.\n- Sampling events and assay results for different individuals are independent, and the sampling process and assay performance are independent conditional on true infection. Assume that false positives are negligible for the purpose of triggering an initial outbreak signal, so a detection requires at least $1$ true positive test from a truly infected individual.\n\nThe surveillance system declares that the outbreak has been detected if there is at least $1$ true positive test among the $n$ infected individuals during the window.\n\nStarting only from fundamental rules of probability for independent Bernoulli trials and complement events, derive an exact expression for the probability that the surveillance system detects the outbreak as a function of $n$, $q$, and $s$. Express your final answer as a single, simplified analytic expression in terms of $n$, $q$, and $s$. Do not substitute numerical values, and do not include any units in your final expression.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probability that a disease outbreak involving $n$ individuals is detected. The detection criteria and probabilistic parameters for the surveillance system are specified. The derivation must proceed from fundamental principles.\n\nLet us first define the relevant events and their probabilities for a single, arbitrarily chosen infected individual from the population of $n$ infected persons.\n\nLet $S$ be the event that a diagnostic specimen is successfully obtained from the infected individual. The problem states the probability of this event, which represents the sampling coverage, is:\n$$ P(S) = q $$\n\nLet $T$ be the event that the diagnostic assay yields a positive result. The problem specifies the sensitivity of the assay, $s$, as the probability of a true positive result conditional on a specimen being obtained from a truly infected individual. This can be written as:\n$$ P(T | S) = s $$\n\nAn individual is considered \"detected\" by the surveillance system if and only if a specimen is obtained from them AND the subsequent assay yields a positive result. Let $D$ be the event of detection for this single individual. The event $D$ is the intersection of events $S$ and $T$. The probability of event $D$, denoted as $p$, can be calculated using the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$:\n$$ p = P(D) = P(T \\cap S) = P(T|S)P(S) $$\nSubstituting the given probabilities, we find the probability of detecting a single infected individual is:\n$$ p = s \\cdot q $$\n\nThe process of determining whether each of the $n$ infected individuals is detected or not can be modeled as a series of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. For each trial (i.e., for each individual $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$), there are two possible outcomes:\n1.  **Success**: The individual is detected. This occurs with probability $p = sq$.\n2.  **Failure**: The individual is not detected. This occurs with probability $1 - p = 1 - sq$.\n\nThe problem states that the events for different individuals are independent.\n\nThe outbreak is declared \"detected\" if there is at least $1$ true positive test among the $n$ infected individuals. Let $D_{outbreak}$ be the event that the outbreak is detected. This corresponds to having at least one \"success\" in the $n$ Bernoulli trials.\n\nCalculating the probability of \"at least one\" success directly would involve summing the probabilities of exactly $1$ success, exactly $2$ successes, and so on, up to $n$ successes. A more direct method, as suggested by the problem, is to use the rule of complement events.\n\nThe complement of the event $D_{outbreak}$ is the event that the outbreak is not detected, which we denote as $D_{outbreak}^c$. The outbreak is not detected if and only if there are zero detections among all $n$ individuals. This means that for every one of the $n$ individuals, the outcome of the Bernoulli trial is a \"failure\".\n\nThe probability of failure for a single trial (i.e., one individual not being detected) is $1 - sq$.\n\nSince the trials for all $n$ individuals are independent, the probability that all $n$ trials result in failure is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(\\text{individual } i \\text{ is not detected}) $$\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}^c) = (1 - sq)^n $$\n\nThe probability of the event $D_{outbreak}$ is $1$ minus the probability of its complement, $D_{outbreak}^c$.\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}) = 1 - P(D_{outbreak}^c) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(D_{outbreak}^c)$, we arrive at the final expression for the probability of detecting the outbreak:\n$$ P(D_{outbreak}) = 1 - (1 - sq)^n $$\n\nThis expression gives the probability of outbreak detection as a function of the number of infected individuals, $n$, the sampling coverage, $q$, and the assay sensitivity, $s$.",

            "introduction": "Once a potential public health event is detected, authorities face a critical decision: should they notify the World Health Organization? This is a high-stakes choice made under uncertainty, where the costs of a false alarm must be weighed against the catastrophic potential of a missed threat. This practice introduces a formal framework for this dilemma using Bayesian decision theory, allowing you to calculate the expected \"regret\" associated with notifying versus not notifying. ",

            "problem": "A national public health authority must decide whether to notify the World Health Organization under the International Health Regulations (IHR) about a newly detected outbreak signal. The authority models the situation as a binary state: either the event truly meets IHR notification criteria (state $H$) or it does not (state $\\neg H$). Before observing any signal, the authority’s prior belief that an event of this type meets IHR notification criteria is $P(H) = 0.20$. The surveillance signal used to inform the decision is characterized by sensitivity $0.70$ (the probability the signal is positive when $H$ is true) and specificity $0.85$ (the probability the signal is negative when $\\neg H$ is true). The authority observes a positive signal.\n\nThe authority uses an asymmetric loss function grounded in population health impact measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), where $L_{FN}$ is the loss from a false negative (not notifying when $H$ is true) and $L_{FP}$ is the loss from a false positive (notifying when $\\neg H$ is true). Assume $L_{FN} = 1000$ and $L_{FP} = 40$, and that correctly classifying the state incurs zero loss. Define the regret of an action as the loss incurred only when the action mismatches the true state. Using the foundational definitions of probability and Bayes’ theorem, compute the expected regret of “notify” and of “do not notify” conditional on the observed positive signal, and report the minimum of these two expected regrets as the misclassification risk for the decision problem.\n\nRound your final answer to four significant figures. Express your final answer in Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs).",
            "solution": "We begin from the fundamental definitions of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem. Let $H$ denote the state that the event is truly notifiable under the International Health Regulations (IHR), and let $S$ denote the surveillance signal. The prior probability is $P(H) = 0.20$, and thus $P(\\neg H) = 1 - P(H) = 0.80$. The sensitivity of the signal is $P(S=+ \\mid H) = 0.70$, and the specificity is $P(S=- \\mid \\neg H) = 0.85$, which implies the false positive rate $P(S=+ \\mid \\neg H) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nUpon observing a positive signal, we update the probability that the event is truly notifiable using Bayes’ theorem:\n$$\nP(H \\mid S=+) = \\frac{P(S=+ \\mid H) P(H)}{P(S=+ \\mid H) P(H) + P(S=+ \\mid \\neg H) P(\\neg H)}.\n$$\nSubstituting the given quantities,\n$$\nP(H \\mid S=+) = \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.20}{0.70 \\times 0.20 + 0.15 \\times 0.80} = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.12} = \\frac{0.14}{0.26}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nP(H \\mid S=+) = \\frac{14}{26} = \\frac{7}{13} \\approx 0.538461538.\n$$\nHence, the posterior probability of the event not being notifiable is\n$$\nP(\\neg H \\mid S=+) = 1 - P(H \\mid S=+) = 1 - \\frac{7}{13} = \\frac{6}{13} \\approx 0.461538462.\n$$\n\nDefine the loss function in terms of misclassification: if the authority chooses to notify when $\\neg H$ is true, the loss incurred is $L_{FP} = 40$. If the authority chooses not to notify when $H$ is true, the loss incurred is $L_{FN} = 1000$. Correct classifications incur zero loss. The expected regret (which equals the expected loss under this misclassification-only loss function) for each action conditional on $S=+$ is computed by taking the expectation of the loss with respect to the posterior distribution of $H$.\n\nFor the action “notify,” regret occurs only if $\\neg H$ is true. Thus, the expected regret of “notify” is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\text{regret} \\mid \\text{notify}, S=+] = P(\\neg H \\mid S=+) \\times L_{FP} = \\frac{6}{13} \\times 40 = \\frac{240}{13}.\n$$\nCompute the value:\n$$\n\\frac{240}{13} \\approx 18.46153846.\n$$\n\nFor the action “do not notify,” regret occurs only if $H$ is true.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological and economic modeling principles, is well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses objective, formal language. It is a standard optimization problem that is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and other flaws. I will therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the optimal restriction intensity $x^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the net benefit function $W(x)$. The net benefit is defined as the difference between the benefits of the restriction, $B(x)$, and the costs of the restriction, $C(x)$.\nThe net benefit function is given by $W(x) = B(x) - C(x)$.\n\nThe benefit, $B(x)$, is the expected harm avoided by implementing restriction intensity $x$ relative to the baseline of no restriction ($x=0$). This is given by $B(x) = L(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda(x))$, where $L$ is the monetized social loss per imported infection, $\\lambda_0$ is the baseline importation rate, and $\\lambda(x)$ is the importation rate under restriction $x$. Substituting the given expression for $\\lambda(x) = \\lambda_0 \\exp(-\\alpha x)$, we have:\n$$B(x) = L(\\lambda_0 - \\lambda_0 \\exp(-\\alpha x)) = L\\lambda_0(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha x))$$\n\nThe cost, $C(x)$, is the monetized loss from trade and travel disruption, given by:\n$$C(x) = \\frac{c}{\\alpha}(\\exp(\\alpha x) - 1)$$\nwhere $c>0$ and $\\alpha>0$ are parameters.\n\nTherefore, the full welfare function to be maximized is:\n$$W(x) = L\\lambda_0(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha x)) - \\frac{c}{\\alpha}(\\exp(\\alpha x) - 1)$$\n\nThe first task is to derive the marginal benefit, $MB(x)$, and marginal cost, $MC(x)$. These are the first derivatives of the benefit and cost functions with respect to $x$.\n\nThe marginal benefit is:\n$$MB(x) = \\frac{dB}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ L\\lambda_0(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha x)) \\right]$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$MB(x) = L\\lambda_0(0 - \\exp(-\\alpha x) \\cdot (-\\alpha)) = L\\lambda_0\\alpha\\exp(-\\alpha x)$$\n\nThe marginal cost is:\n$$MC(x) = \\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{c}{\\alpha}(\\exp(\\alpha x) - 1) \\right]$$\nDifferentiating, we find:\n$$MC(x) = \\frac{c}{\\alpha}(\\exp(\\alpha x) \\cdot \\alpha - 0) = c\\exp(\\alpha x)$$\n\nThe second task is to find the optimal stringency $x^{\\ast}$ that maximizes $W(x)$. According to the principles of optimization, an interior maximizer of a twice-differentiable function must satisfy the first-order condition (FOC), where the first derivative of the function is zero.\nThe first derivative of the welfare function is:\n$$\\frac{dW}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(B(x) - C(x)) = MB(x) - MC(x)$$\nSetting this to zero at the optimum $x = x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{dW}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=x^{\\ast}} = MB(x^{\\ast}) - MC(x^{\\ast}) = 0$$\nThis yields the classic economic equilibrium condition: marginal benefit equals marginal cost.\n$$MB(x^{\\ast}) = MC(x^{\\ast})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $MB(x)$ and $MC(x)$:\n$$L\\lambda_0\\alpha\\exp(-\\alpha x^{\\ast}) = c\\exp(\\alpha x^{\\ast})$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $x^{\\ast}$. We are given that all parameters $L, \\lambda_0, \\alpha, c$ are positive.\nFirst, we gather the terms involving $x^{\\ast}$. Divide both sides by $c$ and multiply by $\\exp(\\alpha x^{\\ast})$:\n$$\\frac{L\\lambda_0\\alpha}{c} = \\frac{\\exp(\\alpha x^{\\ast})}{\\exp(-\\alpha x^{\\ast})} = \\exp(\\alpha x^{\\ast} - (-\\alpha x^{\\ast})) = \\exp(2\\alpha x^{\\ast})$$\nTo solve for $x^{\\ast}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{L\\lambda_0\\alpha}{c}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(2\\alpha x^{\\ast}))$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{L\\lambda_0\\alpha}{c}\\right) = 2\\alpha x^{\\ast}$$\nFinally, isolating $x^{\\ast}$ gives the closed-form expression for the optimal stringency:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{L\\lambda_0\\alpha}{c}\\right)$$\n\nTo confirm that this stationary point is indeed a maximum, we check the second-order condition (SOC), which requires $\\frac{d^2W}{dx^2} < 0$.\n$$\\frac{d^2W}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}(MB(x) - MC(x)) = \\frac{d}{dx}(L\\lambda_0\\alpha\\exp(-\\alpha x) - c\\exp(\\alpha x))$$\n$$\\frac{d^2W}{dx^2} = -L\\lambda_0\\alpha^2\\exp(-\\alpha x) - c\\alpha\\exp(\\alpha x)$$\nGiven that $L > 0$, $\\lambda_0 > 0$, $\\alpha > 0$, and $c > 0$, and the exponential function is always positive, both terms in the expression for the second derivative are negative. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2W}{dx^2} < 0$ for all $x$. This confirms that the welfare function $W(x)$ is strictly concave, and our derived $x^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a unique global maximum. The problem assumes that the parameters are such that $x^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, so this expression is the sought-after interior solution.",
