            "problem": "A consortium of countries is considering a one-year Global Health Security (GHS) prevention package to avert the emergence of a novel pathogen. Without the package, there is a stochastic risk of a severe outbreak occurring exactly one year from now. If the outbreak occurs, it imposes a social loss valued at $L=\\$50$ billion in one year. The outbreak occurs with probability $p=0.05$ within the year. The prevention package is assumed to fully eliminate the outbreak risk over the horizon, conditional on its occurrence. The up-front program cost is $C=\\$1$ billion paid immediately. Society evaluates intertemporal trade-offs using a constant annual social discount rate $r=0.03$ over a horizon $T=1$ year. The consortium uses the Expected Value (EV) criterion and Net Present Value (NPV) decision rule grounded in standard welfare-economic evaluation.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of expected value of uncertain losses and present value under constant discounting, derive the expected net present value of the prevention package and compute its value using the parameters $p$, $L$, $r$, $T$, and $C$ provided above. Based on the sign of the expected net present value, the package is efficient if and only if the expected net present value is positive. Report the computed expected net present value rounded to four significant figures, and express your answer in billions of United States dollars (USD).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and computation of the expected net present value (ENPV) of a global health security prevention package. The analysis will be based on the principles of expected value and net present value.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**1.1. Extracted Givens:**\n- Social loss if outbreak occurs: $L = \\$50$ billion\n- Time of potential loss: $T = 1$ year from now\n- Probability of outbreak without prevention: $p = 0.05$\n- Up-front cost of prevention package: $C = \\$1$ billion\n- Time of cost payment: $t=0$ (immediately)\n- Constant annual social discount rate: $r = 0.03$\n- Time horizon for evaluation: $T = 1$ year\n- Decision framework: Expected Value (EV) criterion and Net Present Value (NPV) decision rule.\n- Efficiency condition: The package is efficient if and only if the expected net present value is positive.\n- Task: Derive the ENPV, compute its value rounded to four significant figures, and express the answer in billions of USD.\n\n**1.2. Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid. It is based on standard, well-established principles of welfare economics and cost-benefit analysis (NPV, expected value, social discounting). The variables are clearly defined, and the parameters provided ($L, p, C, r, T$) are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution. The scenario is a formalized and quantifiable representation of a real-world decision problem in global health financing. There are no scientific contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of logical principles.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nWe proceed with the solution, starting from the core definitions as required.\n\n**2.1. Core Definitions:**\n- **Present Value (PV):** The present value of a future monetary amount $V$ received or paid at time $t$ is its value today, calculated by discounting it with a discount rate $r$. For a constant annual discount rate, the formula is:\n$$PV = \\frac{V}{(1+r)^t}$$\n- **Expected Value (EV):** The expected value of a random variable representing uncertain outcomes is the probability-weighted average of all possible values. For an event with two outcomes $X_1$ and $X_2$ with probabilities $p_1$ and $p_2$ respectively (where $p_1 + p_2 = 1$), the expected value is:\n$$E[X] = p_1 X_1 + p_2 X_2$$\n\n**2.2. Analysis of Scenarios:**\nWe evaluate the expected costs in two scenarios: with and without the prevention package. The net benefit of the package is the difference between the expected costs of these two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario A: Without the Prevention Package**\nIn this case, society faces a stochastic risk. There are two possible outcomes at the end of the year ($t=1$):\n1.  An outbreak occurs with probability $p$. This incurs a social loss of $L$.\n2.  No outbreak occurs with probability $1-p$. The social loss in this case is $0$.\n\nThe expected loss at time $t=1$ is the probability-weighted average of these two outcomes:\n$$E[\\text{Loss at } t=1] = p \\cdot L + (1-p) \\cdot 0 = pL$$\nTo make this future expected loss comparable to the immediate cost of the package, we must discount it to its present value. Using the PV formula with $t=1$:\n$$PV(\\text{Expected Loss}) = \\frac{pL}{(1+r)^T}$$\n\n**Scenario B: With the Prevention Package**\nIn this scenario, a cost $C$ is paid immediately at time $t=0$. The package is assumed to fully eliminate the outbreak risk. Therefore, the expected social loss at $t=1$ is $0$. The only cost associated with this scenario is the up-front program cost $C$. Since this cost is incurred at $t=0$, its present value is simply $C$.\n$$PV(\\text{Cost of Package}) = C$$\n\n**2.3. Expected Net Present Value (ENPV):**\nThe Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) of the prevention package is the present value of its expected benefits minus the present value of its costs. The benefit of the package is the aversion of the expected loss.\n$$ENPV = PV(\\text{Averted Loss}) - PV(\\text{Cost of Package})$$\n$$ENPV = \\frac{pL}{(1+r)^T} - C$$\nThis is the general formula for the ENPV of the prevention package, derived from first principles.\n\n**2.4. Computation:**\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formula. The monetary values $L$ and $C$ are expressed in billions of dollars, so the result will also be in billions of dollars.\n- $p = 0.05$\n- $L = 50$\n- $r = 0.03$\n- $T = 1$\n- $C = 1$\n\n$$ENPV = \\frac{(0.05)(50)}{(1+0.03)^1} - 1$$\n$$ENPV = \\frac{2.5}{1.03} - 1$$\nCalculating the value of the fraction:\n$$\\frac{2.5}{1.03} \\approx 2.4271844660$$\nNow, we complete the calculation for ENPV:\n$$ENPV \\approx 2.4271844660 - 1 = 1.4271844660$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ENPV \\approx 1.427$$\nThe result is in billions of United States dollars. Since the ENPV is positive ($1.427 > 0$), the prevention package is considered economically efficient under the given decision rule.",

Determination of the efficient choice**\n\nWhen comparing mutually exclusive interventions, the optimal choice is the one that maximizes the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The NMB translates health gains into monetary terms using the willingness-to-pay threshold $\\lambda$ and subtracts the cost. An intervention is considered cost-effective if its NMB is greater than or equal to that of the comparator (in this case, the status quo, for which NMB is $0$).\n\nThe NMB is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n$$\n\nWe calculate the NMB for each intervention using the given threshold $\\lambda = \\$1,000$ per DALY.\n\nFor Intervention $1$:\n$$\n\\text{NMB}_1 = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E_1) - \\Delta C_1 = (\\$1,000 \\times 200,000) - \\$200,000,000 = \\$200,000,000 - \\$200,000,000 = \\$0\n$$\n\nFor Intervention $2$:\n$$\n\\text{NMB}_2 = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E_2) - \\Delta C_2 = (\\$1,000 \\times 120,000) - \\$150,000,000 = \\$120,000,000 - \\$150,000,000 = -\\$30,000,000\n$$\n\nThe decision rule is to select the intervention with the highest NMB. Comparing the two:\n$$\n\\text{NMB}_1 = \\$0\n$$\n$$\n\\text{NMB}_2 = -\\$30,000,000\n$$\nSince $\\text{NMB}_1 > \\text{NMB}_2$, Intervention $1$ is the more efficient choice. Its NMB of $0$ indicates it is as valuable as the status quo in net monetary terms, while Intervention $2$, with a negative NMB, would result in a net loss compared to the status quo. Therefore, maximizing NMB leads to the selection of Intervention $1$.\n\n**3. Computation of the incremental NMB of the more efficient intervention**\n\nThe final step is to calculate the incremental net monetary benefit of the more efficient intervention (Intervention $1$) relative to the other intervention (Intervention $2$). This is the difference between their respective NMBs.\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{NMB}_{1 \\text{ vs } 2} = \\text{NMB}_1 - \\text{NMB}_2\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{NMB}_{1 \\text{ vs } 2} = \\$0 - (-\\$30,000,000) = \\$30,000,000\n$$\nThis result can be equivalently calculated by finding the NMB of the incremental costs and effects of Intervention $1$ over Intervention $2$:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{1-2} = \\Delta C_1 - \\Delta C_2 = \\$200 \\times 10^6 - \\$150 \\times 10^6 = \\$50 \\times 10^6\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{1-2} = \\Delta E_1 - \\Delta E_2 = 200,000 - 120,000 = 80,000 \\text{ DALYs}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{NMB}_{1 \\text{ vs } 2} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta E_{1-2}) - \\Delta C_{1-2} = (\\$1,000 \\times 80,000) - \\$50,000,000 = \\$80,000,000 - \\$50,000,000 = \\$30,000,000\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
