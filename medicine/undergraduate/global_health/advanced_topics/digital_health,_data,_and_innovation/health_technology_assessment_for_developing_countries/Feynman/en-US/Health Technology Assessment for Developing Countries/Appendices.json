            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation and interpretation of an Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for a new hypertension management package compared to standard care.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Health Technology Assessment (HTA) from a public payer perspective.\n- Time horizon: $1$ year.\n- Health outcome measure: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted.\n- New Intervention (Intervention $1$):\n  - Average per-patient cost: $C_1 = \\$150$.\n  - Average per-patient effectiveness: $E_1 = 0.02$ DALYs averted.\n- Standard Care (Intervention $0$):\n  - Average per-patient cost: $C_0 = \\$60$.\n  - Average per-patient effectiveness: $E_0 = 0.005$ DALYs averted.\n- Affordability Threshold: $\\$500$ per DALY averted.\n- Required Calculation: Compute the ICER.\n- Required Format: Express ICER in $\\$/\\text{DALY averted}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing standard, well-defined principles of health economics and HTA. The ICER is a fundamental metric for cost-effectiveness analysis. The provided data are complete, consistent, and plausible for the described scenario in a lower-middle-income country. The new intervention is both more costly ($C_1  C_0$) and more effective ($E_1  E_0$), which is the standard scenario for an ICER calculation to determine value for money. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains no scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is a standard metric in health economics used to evaluate the additional cost per unit of additional health benefit gained by a new intervention compared to an alternative (such as standard care). The formula for the ICER is:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_1 - C_0}{E_1 - E_0}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta C$ represents the incremental cost and $\\Delta E$ represents the incremental effectiveness.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Cost of the new intervention, $C_1 = \\$150$.\n- Effectiveness of the new intervention, $E_1 = 0.02$ DALYs averted.\n- Cost of standard care, $C_0 = \\$60$.\n- Effectiveness of standard care, $E_0 = 0.005$ DALYs averted.\n\nFirst, we calculate the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\Delta C = C_1 - C_0 = \\$150 - \\$60 = \\$90\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_1 - E_0 = 0.02 - 0.005 = 0.015 \\text{ DALYs averted}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the ICER by substituting these values into the formula:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{\\$90}{0.015 \\text{ DALYs averted}}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{90}{0.015} \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY averted}} = 6000 \\frac{\\$}{\\text{DALY averted}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $6000$. To represent this quantity unambiguously with four significant figures, we can express it in scientific notation as $6.000 \\times 10^3$. Therefore, the ICER is $\\$6000$ per DALY averted.\n\nThe problem also requires a qualitative interpretation of this result relative to the local affordability threshold of $\\$500$ per DALY averted. This threshold represents the maximum amount the public payer is willing to pay to avert one DALY.\n\nThe decision rule is as follows:\n- If ICER $\\le$ Affordability Threshold, the intervention is considered cost-effective.\n- If ICER $$ Affordability Threshold, the intervention is not considered cost-effective.\n\nIn this case, the calculated ICER is $\\$6000$ per DALY averted, and the affordability threshold is $\\$500$ per DALY averted. We compare these two values:\n$$\n\\$6000  \\$500\n$$\nSince the ICER for the new community-based hypertension management package is substantially higher than the stated affordability threshold, the new intervention is not considered cost-effective from the public payer's perspective. This means that the additional cost of $\\$90$ per patient for an additional health gain of $0.015$ DALYs averted is deemed too expensive relative to what the healthcare system is willing to pay for health improvements. The payer could likely achieve greater health gains for its population by allocating those funds to other interventions with a more favorable cost-effectiveness profile (i.e., an ICER below $\\$500$ per DALY averted).",

            "introduction": "To accurately measure health benefits, we must account for both the length and the quality of life, as well as the economic principle that present benefits are preferred over future ones. This exercise focuses on calculating Quality-Adjusted Life Years ($QALYs$) and applying a discount rate, two cornerstones of valuing health outcomes over time in any HTA. Mastering this allows for a more nuanced comparison of interventions whose benefits unfold over many years. ",

            "problem": "A Ministry of Health in a low-income country is conducting a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) to compare a community health worker intervention to current practice. For a representative patient under the intervention, health-related quality of life is expected to follow this trajectory: a constant utility of $0.7$ for $2$ years, then a constant utility of $0.5$ for $1$ additional year, and death thereafter. The intervention does not change mortality within the first $3$ years but is expected to improve quality of life compared to current practice.\n\nIn HTA, health benefits are evaluated using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), defined as the sum over time of health state utility weights multiplied by the time spent in those states. In economic evaluation, future health is discounted to reflect time preference. Assume discrete annual discounting with an end-of-year convention at a constant annual discount rate of $r=0.03$ per year. That is, each year's QALYs are realized over the year but valued at the end of the year.\n\nUsing first principles (the definition of QALYs and the standard present value approach for discrete annual discounting), compute the total discounted QALYs accrued over the $3$ years. Express the final QALYs in years and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of health economics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language and formulation. It presents a standard calculation in Health Technology Assessment (HTA) without any factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\nThe task is to calculate the total discounted Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) accrued over a period of $3$ years, using first principles. The calculation involves two main concepts: the definition of a QALY and the formula for present value using discrete annual discounting.\n\nFirst, a Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) for a specific time period is defined as the product of the health-related quality of life (utility) score and the duration of that time period. For a single year $t$, where the utility $U_t$ is constant, the undiscounted QALYs accrued during that year are:\n$$Q_t = U_t \\times (1 \\text{ year})$$\n\nSecond, economic evaluation in HTA discounts future health benefits to reflect time preference. The present value ($PV$) of a benefit realized at the end of a specific year $t$ is calculated using a discount factor, a function of the annual discount rate $r$. For discrete, end-of-year discounting, the formula for the present value of a benefit $B_t$ from year $t$ is:\n$$PV(B_t) = \\frac{B_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nCombining these principles, the discounted QALYs for year $t$, denoted as $DQ_t$, are the undiscounted QALYs from that year, $Q_t$, discounted back to the present:\n$$DQ_t = \\frac{Q_t}{(1+r)^t} = \\frac{U_t \\times (1 \\text{ year})}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nThe total discounted QALYs, $DQ_{total}$, over the entire time horizon of $T$ years is the sum of the discounted QALYs from each year:\n$$DQ_{total} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} DQ_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{U_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\n\nNow, we apply the specific values provided in the problem statement.\nThe time horizon is $T=3$ years.\nThe annual discount rate is $r = 0.03$.\nThe health utility trajectory is given as:\n- For year $t=1$: $U_1 = 0.7$\n- For year $t=2$: $U_2 = 0.7$\n- For year $t=3$: $U_3 = 0.5$\n\nWe calculate the discounted QALYs for each of the $3$ years.\n\nFor year $1$:\n$$DQ_1 = \\frac{U_1}{(1+r)^1} = \\frac{0.7}{(1+0.03)^1} = \\frac{0.7}{1.03}$$\n\nFor year $2$:\n$$DQ_2 = \\frac{U_2}{(1+r)^2} = \\frac{0.7}{(1+0.03)^2} = \\frac{0.7}{1.0609}$$\n\nFor year $3$:\n$$DQ_3 = \\frac{U_3}{(1+r)^3} = \\frac{0.5}{(1+0.03)^3} = \\frac{0.5}{1.092727}$$\n\nThe total discounted QALYs are the sum of these values:\n$$DQ_{total} = DQ_1 + DQ_2 + DQ_3$$\n$$DQ_{total} = \\frac{0.7}{1.03} + \\frac{0.7}{1.0609} + \\frac{0.5}{1.092727}$$\n\nNow, we perform the numerical computation:\n$$DQ_{total} \\approx 0.67961165... + 0.65982241... + 0.45757060...$$\n$$DQ_{total} \\approx 1.79700466$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of the result $1.79700466$ are $1$, $7$, $9$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $0$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up the fourth significant figure.\nTherefore, the total discounted QALYs rounded to four significant figures is $1.797$.",
