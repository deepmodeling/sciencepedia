The Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) is the gold standard metric for quantifying the total burden of disease, combining years of life lost to premature death ($YLL$) with years lived with disability ($YLD$). This practice provides a foundational, hands-on calculation that directly illustrates the core phenomenon of the transition: the shift in disease burden from communicable to non-communicable diseases by analyzing hypothetical data from two different time points .",

For each year, three mutually exclusive causes contribute to the burden of disease: lower respiratory infection (communicable), ischemic heart disease (noncommunicable), and road injury (injury). For each cause, you are given the incidence rate of nonfatal cases per $100{,}000$ population per year, the disability weight (unitless), the average duration of disability per incident case in years, the death rate per $100{,}000$ population per year, and the average remaining standard life expectancy at death in years.

All necessary data are provided, and the requested calculations are based on the standard, established principles of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The data values are plausible and dimensionally consistent. The problem is a direct application of epidemiological and public health quantitative methods.\n\nThe central metric is the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), which quantifies the total burden of disease. It is the sum of two components: Years of Life Lost due to premature mortality ($YLL$) and Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$).\nThe formula for DALYs for a specific cause is given by:\n$$DALY = YLL + YLD$$\nAll calculations will be performed per $100{,}000$ population, as the input data are provided in this format.\n\nThe components are calculated as follows, based on the problem's explicit conditions of no time discounting and no age-weighting:\n1.  Years of Life Lost ($YLL$): The product of the number of deaths and the standard life expectancy at the age of death. Using the provided rates and averages:\n    $$YLL = M \\times E$$\n    where $M$ is the death rate per $100{,}000$ population per year, and $E$ is the average remaining standard life expectancy at death in years.\n\n2.  Years Lived with Disability ($YLD$): The product of the number of incident cases, the disability weight for the condition, and the average duration of the disability.

The largest contributor was the communicable disease, lower respiratory infection, accounting for $4837.8$ DALYs, or approximately $51.8\\%$ of the total burden. The noncommunicable disease, ischemic heart disease, accounted for $3120$ DALYs ($33.4\\%$), and road injuries for $1377$ DALYs ($14.8\\%$).\nBy the year $2020$, the total burden of disease had decreased to $7955.775$ DALYs per $100{,}000$. However, its composition shifted dramatically. The burden from LRI fell sharply to $2718.9$ DALYs ($34.2\\%$), while the burden from IHD rose to $4030$ DALYs, becoming the dominant cause at $50.7\\%$ of the total burden. The burden from injuries remained relatively stable in its proportional contribution ($15.1\\%$). This inversion, where noncommunicable diseases overtake communicable diseases as the leading cause of health loss, is the defining characteristic of the epidemiological transition.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of total DALYs per $100{,}000$ in year $2020$ to that in year $2000$.\n$$Ratio = \\frac{DALY_{total, 2020}}{DALY_{total, 2000}} = \\frac{7955.775}{9334.8} \\approx 0.8522718$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the ratio is $0.8523$.",

Counterfactual Scenario (`cf`)**\nThe parameters are:\n- $\\mu_{I}^{\\text{cf}} = 0.01$\n- $\\mu_{N0} = 0.002$\n- $\\mu_{N1} = 0.06$\n- $A = 50$\n- $L^{*} = 85$\n- $w = 0.2$\n\nThe scenario-specific hazards are:\n- $\\mu_{0}^{\\text{cf}} = \\mu_{I}^{\\text{cf}} + \\mu_{N0} = 0.01 + 0.002 = 0.012 \\,\\text{year}^{-1}$\n- $\\mu_{1}^{\\text{cf}} = \\mu_{I}^{\\text{cf}} + \\mu_{N1} = 0.01 + 0.06 = 0.07 \\,\\text{year}^{-1}$\n\nWe calculate the survival probability to age $A=50$:\n$$ S^{\\text{cf}}(A) = \\exp(-\\mu_{0}^{\\text{cf}} A) = \\exp(-0.012 \\times 50) = \\exp(-0.6) $$\n$$ S^{\\text{cf}}(A) \\approx 0.548812 $$\nNow, we calculate life expectancy:\n$$ e_{0}^{\\text{cf}} = \\frac{1 - S^{\\text{cf}}(A)}{\\mu_{0}^{\\text{cf}}} + \\frac{S^{\\text{cf}}(A)}{\\mu_{1}^{\\text{cf}}} = \\frac{1 - \\exp(-0.6)}{0.012} + \\frac{\\exp(-0.6)}{0.07} $$\n$$ e_{0}^{\\text{cf}} \\approx \\frac{1 - 0.548812}{0.012} + \\frac{0.548812}{0.07} \\approx 37.59903 + 7.84017 = 45.43920 \\,\\text{years} $$\nNext, we calculate YLD:\n$$ YLD^{\\text{cf}} = w \\frac{S^{\\text{cf}}(A)}{\\mu_{1}^{\\text{cf}}} = 0.2 \\times \\frac{\\exp(-0.6)}{0.07} \\approx 0.2 \\times 7.84017 = 1.56803 \\,\\text{years} $$\nAnd YLL and DALYs:\n$$ YLL^{\\text{cf}} = L^{*} - e_{0}^{\\text{cf}} = 85 - 45.43920 = 39.56080 \\,\\text{years} $$\n$$ \\text{DALYs}^{\\text{cf}} = YLL^{\\text{cf}} + YLD^{\\text{cf}} = 39.56080 + 1.56803 = 41.12883 \\,\\text{years} $$\n\n**3. Observed-Minus-Counterfactual Differences**\nWe are asked to find the differences $\\Delta e_0 = e_0^{\\text{obs}} - e_0^{\\text{cf}}$ and $\\Delta \\text{DALYs} = \\text{DALYs}^{\\text{obs}} - \\text{DALYs}^{\\text{cf}}$.\n\nDifference in life expectancy:\n$$ \\Delta e_0 = 54.77224 - 45.43920 = 9.33304 \\,\\text{years} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta e_0 = 9.333$ years.\n\nDifference in DALYs:\n$$ \\Delta \\text{DALYs} = 32.54282 - 41.12883 = -8.58601 \\,\\text{years} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\Delta \\text{DALYs} = -8.586$ years.\n\nThe positive change in life expectancy reflects the mortality reduction. The negative change in DALYs indicates a net improvement in population health, where the large gain from reduced premature mortality (lower YLL) more than compensates for the smaller increase in disability burden from people living longer (shorter YLL but higher YLD).",
