While this has immense benefits, it also creates pathways for the rapid international spread of infectious diseases. This exercise provides a foundational tool for quantifying this risk. By applying fundamental principles of probability, you will calculate the likelihood that at least one infected traveler arrives in a city on a given day, transforming an abstract concern into a concrete, measurable risk.",

            "problem": "International air travel can facilitate the geographic spread of infectious diseases. Consider a city that receives $50$ incoming commercial flights per day from a globally connected network. Assume each flight brings exactly $n=150$ passengers and that the infection prevalence among travelers is $p=0.002$. Treat each passenger’s infection status as an independent Bernoulli outcome with probability $p$ of being infected, and assume independence across all passengers and flights. Using only these assumptions and fundamental probability definitions, determine the probability that at least one infected traveler arrives in the city on a given day. Express your final probability as a decimal and round to seven significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to calculate the probability that at least one infected traveler arrives in the city on a given day. Let this event be denoted by $A$.\n\nA direct calculation of $P(A)$ would involve summing the probabilities of exactly one infected traveler arriving, exactly two, and so on, up to the total number of travelers. This is computationally intensive. A more efficient method is to use the complement rule. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that *no* infected travelers arrive on a given day. The probability of event $A$ is then given by:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of travelers arriving in the city per day. Let $N_{flights}$ be the number of flights and $n$ be the number of passengers per flight. The total number of travelers, $N_{total}$, is:\n$$N_{total} = N_{flights} \\times n = 50 \\times 150 = 7500$$\n\nThe problem states that the infection prevalence among travelers is $p = 0.002$. This is the probability that any single traveler is infected. Consequently, the probability that a single traveler is *not* infected is $1 - p$.\n$$1 - p = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\n\nThe event $A^c$ (no infected travelers arrive) occurs if and only if all $N_{total}$ travelers are not infected. The problem specifies that each passenger's infection status is an independent Bernoulli outcome. Due to this independence, the probability that all $N_{total}$ travelers are not infected is the product of their individual probabilities of not being infected:\n$$P(A^c) = (1 - p)^{N_{total}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(A^c) = (0.998)^{7500}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability of event $A$, that at least one infected traveler arrives:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - (0.998)^{7500}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we evaluate the expression.\nFirst, we compute $(0.998)^{7500}$:\n$$(0.998)^{7500} \\approx 3.0140715 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThen, we subtract this value from $1$:\n$$P(A) \\approx 1 - 3.0140715 \\times 10^{-7} = 0.99999969859285...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to seven significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is the first $9$. We count seven digits from there.\nThe value is $0.99999969859...$\nThe first seven significant figures are $9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 6$. The eighth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we must round up the seventh significant figure (the $6$).\nRounding $6$ up gives $7$.\nThus, the rounded probability is $0.9999997$.",

            "introduction": "Building on the concept of importation risk, public health agencies must not only assess threats but also evaluate potential interventions. When faced with an emerging pathogen, reducing travel volume is a common policy response. This practice moves beyond a static risk assessment to a dynamic one, using the Poisson process to model how travel restrictions can delay the arrival of the first imported case . This skill is crucial for understanding the temporal dynamics of epidemic control and the effectiveness of border measures.",

            "problem": "A national public health agency monitors the risk of importing cases of an emerging infectious disease through international air travel. Assume independent infection status among travelers and low prevalence such that the number of infected arrivals can be modeled using a Poisson process whose constant rate equals the expected number of infected travelers per unit time. Under this linear importation risk assumption, the rate parameter is given by $\\lambda = V p$ per week, where $V$ is the weekly number of incoming travelers and $p$ is the disease prevalence among travelers. Epidemic establishment is operationally defined as the first imported case arriving.\n\nSuppose border control measures reduce weekly travel volume from $V_{0} = 100{,}000$ travelers per week to $V_{1} = 30{,}000$ travelers per week, and the traveler prevalence is $p = 0.001$. Compute the expected delay in the time to the first imported case caused by this reduction, defined as the difference between the expected time to the first imported case under $V_{1}$ and under $V_{0}$. Express your final numerical answer in days, and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem states that the arrival of infected travelers can be modeled as a Poisson process. A fundamental property of a Poisson process with a constant rate parameter $\\lambda$ is that the time interval between consecutive events follows an exponential distribution with the same rate parameter $\\lambda$. The time to the first event is therefore a random variable $T$ that follows an exponential distribution.\n\nThe probability density function for such a random variable $T$ is given by $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. The expected value, or mean, of an exponentially distributed random variable $T$ is the reciprocal of its rate parameter:\n$$E[T] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$$\n\nThe rate parameter $\\lambda$ is given by the formula $\\lambda = Vp$, where $V$ is the weekly number of travelers and $p$ is the disease prevalence. The units of $\\lambda$ are infected travelers per week, and thus the units of $E[T]$ are weeks.\n\nWe are given two scenarios for travel volume: an initial volume $V_0$ and a reduced volume $V_1$.\nThe given values are:\nInitial weekly travel volume: $V_0 = 100,000$\nReduced weekly travel volume: $V_1 = 30,000$\nDisease prevalence: $p = 0.001$\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate parameter for each scenario.\nThe rate for the initial scenario, $\\lambda_0$, is:\n$$\\lambda_0 = V_0 p = 100,000 \\times 0.001 = 100 \\text{ week}^{-1}$$\nThe rate for the reduced scenario, $\\lambda_1$, is:\n$$\\lambda_1 = V_1 p = 30,000 \\times 0.001 = 30 \\text{ week}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we determine the expected time to the first imported case for each scenario. Let $T_0$ be the time to the first case with rate $\\lambda_0$, and $T_1$ be the time to the first case with rate $\\lambda_1$.\nThe expected time for the initial scenario is:\n$$E[T_0] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_0} = \\frac{1}{100} \\text{ weeks}$$\nThe expected time for the reduced scenario is:\n$$E[T_1] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_1} = \\frac{1}{30} \\text{ weeks}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected delay, which is the difference between the expected time under the reduced volume and the expected time under the initial volume. Let this delay be $\\Delta E$.\n$$\\Delta E = E[T_1] - E[T_0]$$\nSubstituting the calculated expected times:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{30} - \\frac{1}{100} \\text{ weeks}$$\nTo subtract the fractions, we use a common denominator of $300$:\n$$\\Delta E = \\frac{10}{300} - \\frac{3}{300} = \\frac{7}{300} \\text{ weeks}$$\n\nThe final answer must be expressed in days. We convert weeks to days by multiplying by $7$:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{days}} = \\frac{7}{300} \\text{ weeks} \\times 7 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} = \\frac{49}{300} \\text{ days}$$\n\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\frac{49}{300} \\approx 0.163333... \\text{ days}$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $0.163$.",
