            "problem": "A monoclonal antibody immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) binds the receptor with an equilibrium dissociation constant (denoted as $K_D$). Consider a one-site, reversible binding interaction between free receptor $R$ and free antibody (ligand) $L$ forming the receptor–ligand complex $RL$. Assume rapid equilibrium, mass-action kinetics, and that the total receptor concentration is much smaller than the free antibody concentration so that the bulk drug concentration equals the free concentration at the receptor microenvironment.

Your final numerical answer must only be the occupancy value.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It outlines a standard problem in receptor pharmacology based on mass-action kinetics and asks for a derivation and calculation that can be performed with the given information.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the receptor occupancy, $\\mathrm{Occ}$, as a function of drug concentration, $C$, and the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$. The derivation begins with the definitions provided.\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, for the reversible reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$ is given by:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand (the antibody), and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_T$, is conserved and is the sum of the free and bound receptor concentrations:\n$$\nR_T = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the free receptor concentration in terms of the total and bound concentrations:\n$$\n[R] = R_T - [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $K_D$ yields:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{(R_T - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nThe problem states the assumption that the total receptor concentration is much smaller than the free antibody concentration. This allows us to approximate the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, with the total bulk drug concentration, $C$. Thus, we set $[L] \\approx C$.\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{(R_T - [RL])C}{[RL]}\n$$\nThe objective is to find an expression for the receptor occupancy, $\\mathrm{Occ}$, which is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Occ} = \\frac{[RL]}{R_T}\n$$\nTo solve for this quantity, we rearrange the equation for $K_D$:\n$$\nK_D [RL] = (R_T - [RL])C\n$$\n$$\nK_D [RL] = R_T C - [RL]C\n$$\nNext, we gather all terms containing $[RL]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\nK_D [RL] + [RL]C = R_T C\n$$\nFactoring out $[RL]$ gives:\n$$\n[RL](K_D + C) = R_T C\n$$\nFinally, dividing both sides by $R_T$ and by $(K_D + C)$ isolates the desired ratio $\\frac{[RL]}{R_T}$:\n$$\n\\frac{[RL]}{R_T} = \\frac{C}{K_D + C}\n$$\nTherefore, the receptor occupancy as a function of $C$ and $K_D$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Occ} = \\frac{C}{C + K_D}\n$$\nThis is a specific form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a single binding site.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires the computation of $\\mathrm{Occ}$ for the given values:\n- Drug concentration, $C = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n- Equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for occupancy:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Occ} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}}{50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL} + 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu g/mL}} = \\frac{50}{51}\n$$\nThe units cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity as expected for a fraction. Performing the division gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Occ} \\approx 0.980392156...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Occ} \\approx 0.9804\n$$\nRegarding the interpretation, an occupancy of $0.9804$ signifies that approximately $98\\%$ of the PD-1 receptors on the relevant T-cells are bound by the inhibitor antibody. The problem suggests that functional blockade often correlates with occupancies near or above $0.9$. Since $0.9804 > 0.9$, it is expected that PD-1 signaling would be substantially inhibited at this drug concentration. The mechanistic implication for T-cell activation is that the blockade of the inhibitory PD-1 pathway \"releases the brakes\" on the T-cell. By preventing PD-1 from interacting with its ligands (PD-L1/PD-L2), the antibody restores the T-cell's ability to mount a robust anti-tumor response, characterized by increased proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity against cancer cells.",

There are no subjective or speculative claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formally structured, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional occupancy of CARs, denoted by $\\theta$, as a function of antigen density $D$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$. Fractional occupancy is defined as the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors, $[RL]$, to the total concentration of receptors, $[R_{total}]$.\n\nThe total receptor concentration is the sum of unbound ($[R]$) and bound ($[RL]$) receptors:\n$$[R_{total}] = [R] + [RL]$$\nThus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_{total}]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nFrom the given definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{D} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, we can solve for the concentration of unbound receptors, $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{D}[RL]}{[L]}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_{D}[RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nWe can factor out $[RL]$ from the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1\\right)}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of complexes, $[RL] \\neq 0$, we can cancel this term:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\nThe problem states that the effective antigen density $D$ substitutes for the ligand concentration $[L]$. Therefore, the fractional occupancy as a function of $D$ and $K_{D}$ is:\n$$\\theta(D) = \\frac{D}{K_{D} + D}$$\nNow, we compute the fractional occupancy for the tumor and normal tissues using the given values.\n\nFor the tumor tissue, with $D_{t} = 1 \\times 10^{5}$ and $K_{D} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$:\n$$\\theta_{t} = \\frac{D_{t}}{K_{D} + D_{t}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{2 \\times 10^{4} + 1 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{0.2 \\times 10^{5} + 1 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{5}}{1.2 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{1}{1.2} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nFor the normal tissue, with $D_{n} = 5 \\times 10^{3}$ and $K_{D} = 2 \\times 10^{4}$:\n$$\\theta_{n} = \\frac{D_{n}}{K_{D} + D_{n}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{2 \\times 10^{4} + 5 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{20 \\times 10^{3} + 5 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{3}}{25 \\times 10^{3}} = \\frac{5}{25} = \\frac{1}{5}$$\nThe problem states that the effective stimulus for activation is proportional to the fractional occupancy. Let a generic activation stimulus be $S$. Then $S = c \\cdot \\theta$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\nThe activation in tumor tissue is $S_{t} = c \\cdot \\theta_{t}$.\nThe activation in normal tissue is $S_{n} = c \\cdot \\theta_{n}$.\n\nThe relative activation ratio between tumor and normal tissues is the ratio $\\frac{S_{t}}{S_{n}}$:\n$$\\text{Relative Activation Ratio} = \\frac{S_{t}}{S_{n}} = \\frac{c \\cdot \\theta_{t}}{c \\cdot \\theta_{n}} = \\frac{\\theta_{t}}{\\theta_{n}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $\\theta_{t}$ and $\\theta_{n}$:\n$$\\text{Relative Activation Ratio} = \\frac{5/6}{1/5} = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{1} = \\frac{25}{6}$$\nTo provide a numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction:\n$$\\frac{25}{6} = 4.1666...$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the relative activation ratio is $4.17$.\n\nFinally, a qualitative comment on the risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity is requested. The fractional occupancy in normal tissue, $\\theta_{n}$, is calculated to be $1/5$, or $0.2$. This is a substantial level of receptor engagement. Since CAR T-cell activation is proportional to this occupancy, it implies a significant degree of activation will occur in the normal tissue. The relative activation ratio of tumor to normal tissue is only $\\approx 4.17$. This low ratio represents a narrow therapeutic window. It suggests that in order to achieve a therapeutically effective level of activation against tumor cells (which have an occupancy of $\\theta_t = 5/6 \\approx 0.833$), a significant and potentially harmful level of activation against normal cells is unavoidable. Therefore, there is a high predicted risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity, where CAR T-cells attack healthy tissues that express the target antigen at lower levels.",

The total number of cases, let's call this random variable $C$, in a cohort of size $N$ therefore follows a binomial distribution, $C \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\n\nThe expected value (or mean) of a binomial distribution is given by the product of the number of trials $N$ and the probability of success per trial $p$.\n$$E[C] = Np$$\n\nWe apply this formula to calculate the expected number of colitis cases for each of the two therapeutic scenarios, using the specified cohort size $N=500$.\n\n**1.
