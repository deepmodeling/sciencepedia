The homogeneous equation $\\frac{dX_u}{dt} = -(k_d+k_c)X_u$ has a solution $C_1 \\exp(-(k_d+k_c)t)$. The particular solution is the steady state, $X_{u,p} = k_p / (k_d+k_c)$.\nThe general solution is $X_u(t) = \\frac{k_p}{k_d+k_c} + C_1 \\exp(-(k_d+k_c)t)$.\nUsing the initial condition $X_u(0) = k_p/k_d$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_p}{k_d} = \\frac{k_p}{k_d+k_c} + C_1 \\implies C_1 = k_p \\left( \\frac{1}{k_d} - \\frac{1}{k_d+k_c} \\right) = k_p \\frac{k_d+k_c-k_d}{k_d(k_d+k_c)} = \\frac{k_p k_c}{k_d(k_d+k_c)}\n$$\nThus, the solution for $X_u(t)$ is:\n$$\nX_u(t) = \\frac{k_p}{k_d+k_c} + \\frac{k_p k_c}{k_d(k_d+k_c)} \\exp(-(k_d+k_c)t)\n$$\nNext, we solve for $X_s(t)$ by substituting $X_u(t)$ into its ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_s}{dt} + k_d X_s = k_c X_u(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE that can be solved using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp(k_d t)$ and the initial condition $X_s(0)=0$.
