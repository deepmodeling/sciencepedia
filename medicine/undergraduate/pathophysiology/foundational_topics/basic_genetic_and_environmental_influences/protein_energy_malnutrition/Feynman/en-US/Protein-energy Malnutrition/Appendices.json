One anthropometric index used is the Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ), defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards as a standardized measure of how far an observed weight deviates from a reference distribution for a given height, in units of the standard deviation. You are provided the following measurements and reference values for a child with height $65$ cm:\n- Observed body weight: $6.0$ kg.\n- Reference median weight for height: $7.5$ kg.\n- Reference standard deviation (SD) of weight at that height: $0.8$ kg.\n\nUsing only these data and the definition of a standardized Z-score as a deviation expressed in units of the standard deviation relative to the reference median, compute the patient’s Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ).

            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient height: $65$ cm\n- Observed body weight: $6.0$ kg\n- Reference median weight for height: $7.5$ kg\n- Reference standard deviation (SD) of weight at that height: $0.8$ kg\n- Definition of a Z-score: \"a deviation expressed in units of the standard deviation relative to the reference median\".\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as the concept of the Z-score is a fundamental statistical tool widely used in medical science, particularly in anthropometry as described by the World Health Organization (WHO). The provided values for weight, height, median, and standard deviation are physiologically plausible for a pediatric patient. The problem is well-posed, providing a clear definition and all necessary data for the calculation. The language is objective and precise. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not violate any scientific or mathematical principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe task is to compute the Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ). The problem defines a Z-score as a measure of the deviation of an observed value from the reference median, expressed in units of the standard deviation. This definition translates directly into a standard statistical formula.\n\nLet $X$ represent the observed value, $\\mu_{ref}$ represent the reference median, and $\\sigma_{ref}$ represent the reference standard deviation. The Z-score, denoted as $Z$, is calculated as:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu_{ref}}{\\sigma_{ref}}$$\n\nIn the context of this problem, these variables correspond to the given anthropometric data for the patient's specific height of $65$ cm:\n- The observed body weight is $X = 6.0$ kg.\n- The reference median weight is $\\mu_{ref} = 7.5$ kg.\n- The reference standard deviation is $\\sigma_{ref} = 0.8$ kg.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Z-score formula to calculate the WHZ:\n$$WHZ = \\frac{6.0 - 7.5}{0.8}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the deviation of the observed weight from the median weight:\n$$X - \\mu_{ref} = 6.0 - 7.5 = -1.5 \\text{ kg}$$\nThis negative value indicates that the patient's weight is below the reference median for their height.\n\nNext, we normalize this deviation by dividing it by the standard deviation. This expresses the deviation in units of standard deviations.\n$$WHZ = \\frac{-1.5}{0.8}$$\n\nTo find the exact numerical value, we can express the fraction using integers:\n$$WHZ = \\frac{-1.5 \\times 10}{0.8 \\times 10} = \\frac{-15}{8}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact decimal value:\n$$WHZ = -1.875$$\n\nThe WHZ is a dimensionless quantity, as the units (kg) in the numerator and denominator cancel out. The result, $-1.875$, indicates that the patient's weight is $1.875$ standard deviations below the median weight for a child of the same height according to the reference standards. The problem requires the exact value, which is $-1.875$.",

            "introduction": "One of the defining clinical signs of kwashiorkor is edema, the swelling caused by excess fluid trapped in the body's tissues. This phenomenon can be explained by the Starling principle, which governs fluid exchange across capillaries. This practice explores how a reduction in plasma protein, a hallmark of kwashiorkor, disrupts this delicate balance and leads to edema. ",
            "id": "4828901",
            "problem": "A child with protein-energy malnutrition consistent with kwashiorkor presents with generalized edema. Hypoalbuminemia lowers the plasma colloid osmotic pressure and thereby alters the microvascular Starling forces that govern transcapillary fluid movement. Consider a systemic capillary where hydrostatic pressures are unchanged during the course of illness. At baseline, plasma albumin concentration is $4.0$ g/dL and the capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure is $\\pi_{c}=25$ mmHg. During illness, plasma albumin falls to $2.0$ g/dL. Assume the following are true for this capillary bed:\n- The capillary reflection coefficient for albumin is $\\sigma=0.9$.\n- The interstitial colloid osmotic pressure remains constant throughout the interval.\n- The plasma colloid osmotic pressure $\\pi_{c}$ scales linearly with plasma albumin concentration.\n\nUsing the concept of Starling forces (hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures and the reflection coefficient), derive from first principles the change in net filtration pressure across the capillary attributable solely to the fall in $\\pi_{c}$, and state its sign to indicate whether filtration is increased or decreased. Express the final change in net filtration pressure in millimeters of mercury and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in net filtration pressure across a capillary wall due to a decrease in plasma albumin concentration, a hallmark of kwashiorkor. This analysis is grounded in the Starling principle of transcapillary fluid exchange.\n\nThe net filtration pressure, $P_{\\text{net}}$, which determines the net direction of fluid movement across the capillary endothelium, is given by the Starling equation. This equation balances the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures across the membrane. A positive $P_{\\text{net}}$ indicates net filtration (fluid moving out of the capillary), while a negative $P_{\\text{net}}$ indicates net reabsorption (fluid moving into the capillary). The equation is:\n$$ P_{\\text{net}} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_c - \\pi_i) $$\nwhere:\n- $P_c$ is the capillary hydrostatic pressure.\n- $P_i$ is the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure.\n- $\\sigma$ is the capillary reflection coefficient for plasma proteins (primarily albumin). It represents the effectiveness of the osmotic pressure gradient across the membrane. A value of $1$ means the solute is completely reflected, and $0$ means it is freely permeable.\n- $\\pi_c$ is the capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure (oncotic pressure), primarily determined by plasma proteins.\n- $\\pi_i$ is the interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure.\n\nWe are asked to find the change in the net filtration pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$, attributable solely to the change in plasma colloid osmotic pressure, $\\pi_c$. The change is defined as the final value minus the initial value:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = P_{\\text{net, final}} - P_{\\text{net, initial}} $$\nThe problem states that the hydrostatic pressures ($P_c$ and $P_i$) and the interstitial colloid osmotic pressure ($\\pi_i$) remain constant. The reflection coefficient $\\sigma$ is also a constant property of the capillary bed.\n\nLet's write the expressions for the initial and final net filtration pressures.\nInitial state:\n$$ P_{\\text{net, initial}} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} - \\pi_i) $$\nFinal state (during illness):\n$$ P_{\\text{net, final}} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{final}} - \\pi_i) $$\nNow, we compute the difference, $\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = \\left[ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{final}} - \\pi_i) \\right] - \\left[ (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} - \\pi_i) \\right] $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = (P_c - P_i) - \\sigma \\pi_{c, \\text{final}} + \\sigma \\pi_i - (P_c - P_i) + \\sigma \\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} - \\sigma \\pi_i $$\nThe constant terms $(P_c - P_i)$ and $\\sigma \\pi_i$ cancel out, yielding:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = \\sigma \\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} - \\sigma \\pi_{c, \\text{final}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} - \\pi_{c, \\text{final}}) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = - \\sigma (\\pi_{c, \\text{final}} - \\pi_{c, \\text{initial}}) = - \\sigma \\Delta \\pi_c $$\nThis derived expression shows that the change in net filtration pressure is directly proportional to the negative of the change in plasma colloid osmotic pressure, scaled by the reflection coefficient.\n\nNext, we must determine the final plasma colloid osmotic pressure, $\\pi_{c, \\text{final}}$. The problem states that $\\pi_c$ scales linearly with the plasma albumin concentration, $[Alb]$. We can express this as $\\pi_c = k[Alb]$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\nWe are given the baseline (initial) values:\n$[Alb]_{\\text{initial}} = 4.0 \\, \\text{g/dL}$\n$\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n\nAnd the values during illness (final):\n$[Alb]_{\\text{final}} = 2.0 \\, \\text{g/dL}$\n\nUsing the linear relationship, we can set up a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\pi_{c, \\text{final}}}{\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}}} = \\frac{[Alb]_{\\text{final}}}{[Alb]_{\\text{initial}}} $$\nSolving for $\\pi_{c, \\text{final}}$:\n$$ \\pi_{c, \\text{final}} = \\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} \\times \\frac{[Alb]_{\\text{final}}}{[Alb]_{\\text{initial}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\pi_{c, \\text{final}} = 25 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\times \\frac{2.0 \\, \\text{g/dL}}{4.0 \\, \\text{g/dL}} = 25 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\times 0.5 = 12.5 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\nNow we have all the necessary components to calculate $\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$. The known values are:\n$\\sigma = 0.9$\n$\\pi_{c, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n$\\pi_{c, \\text{final}} = 12.5 \\, \\text{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived equation for $\\Delta P_{\\text{net}}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = 0.9 \\times (25 \\, \\text{mmHg} - 12.5 \\, \\text{mmHg}) $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = 0.9 \\times (12.5 \\, \\text{mmHg}) $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{net}} = 11.25 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $11.25$ already has four significant figures.\nThe sign of the change is positive, which indicates that $P_{\\text{net, final}} > P_{\\text{net, initial}}$. This means the net pressure driving fluid out of the capillary has increased. An increase in net filtration pressure promotes filtration and leads to an accumulation of fluid in the interstitial space, which is the pathophysiological basis for the observed edema.",
