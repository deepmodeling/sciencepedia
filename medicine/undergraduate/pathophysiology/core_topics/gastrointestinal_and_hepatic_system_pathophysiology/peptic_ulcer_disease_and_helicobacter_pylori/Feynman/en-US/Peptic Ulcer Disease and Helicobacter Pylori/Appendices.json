            "problem": "A 38-year-old patient with epigastric pain, nocturnal dyspepsia, and a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is evaluated for suspected peptic ulcer disease.

            "solution": "Let $D$ denote the event that the patient truly has Helicobacter pylori infection, and let $+$ and $-$ denote positive and negative test results, respectively.

            "problem": "A $45$-year-old patient presents with epigastric pain and a confirmed duodenal ulcer. A urea breath test is positive for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). The patient reports an immediate-type penicillin allergy with childhood anaphylaxis. Relevant clinical details: no prior H. pylori treatment, no pregnancy, normal renal and hepatic function, and no anticoagulant or salicylate use. The institution’s antibiogram shows an H. pylori clarithromycin resistance rate of $25\\%$ and a metronidazole resistance rate of $40\\%$. The formulary includes proton pump inhibitors (PPI; proton pump inhibitor), bismuth subsalicylate and subcitrate, tetracycline, metronidazole, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and rifabutin; vonoprazan (a potassium-competitive acid blocker, P-CAB) is not available. The patient has received multiple courses of azithromycin for sinusitis during the past $2$ years.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental base:\n- Bacterial eradication requires combining effective antimicrobial agents with adequate intragastric acid suppression to raise intragastric pH and enhance antibiotic stability and bacterial replication-phase susceptibility.\n- Empiric regimens should account for local antimicrobial resistance; macrolide resistance substantially reduces the efficacy of clarithromycin-containing triple therapy, particularly when the local clarithromycin resistance rate exceeds approximately $15\\%$.\n- Immediate-type penicillin allergy contraindicates amoxicillin.\n- Bismuth salts exert direct antimicrobial activity and synergize with nitroimidazoles and tetracyclines, and higher metronidazole dosing can partially overcome moderate metronidazole resistance.\n- Multidrug regimens with non-cross-resistant agents and sufficient duration (for example, $14$ days) improve eradication rates and reduce resistance selection.\n\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate first-line empiric eradication regimen for this patient, and why?\n\nA. Optimized bismuth quadruple therapy for $14$ days: a proton pump inhibitor given $2$ times daily, bismuth subcitrate or subsalicylate given $4$ times daily, tetracycline $500$ mg given $4$ times daily, and metronidazole $500$ mg given $3$ to $4$ times daily; chosen to avoid amoxicillin and to maintain efficacy despite local macrolide resistance.\n\nB. Non-bismuth triple therapy for $10$ days: a proton pump inhibitor given $2$ times daily, clarithromycin $500$ mg given $2$ times daily, and metronidazole $500$ mg given $2$ times daily; chosen to avoid amoxicillin and simplify dosing.\n\nC. Levofloxacin-based triple therapy for $10$ days: a proton pump inhibitor given $2$ times daily, levofloxacin $500$ mg given $1$ time daily, and metronidazole $500$ mg given $2$ times daily; chosen to avoid amoxicillin and clarithromycin.\n\nD. Sequential therapy for $10$ days: days $1$–$5$ a proton pump inhibitor plus metronidazole, followed by days $6$–$10$ a proton pump inhibitor plus clarithromycin plus amoxicillin; chosen to leverage sequential bacterial susceptibility.\n\nE. Vonoprazan-based triple therapy for $14$ days: vonoprazan given $2$ times daily, clarithromycin $500$ mg given $2$ times daily, and metronidazole $500$ mg given $2$ times daily; chosen to overcome macrolide resistance via potent acid suppression.\n\nSelect one option. Provide a justification grounded in the fundamental base above, explicitly addressing antibiotic selection in the setting of immediate-type penicillin allergy, local resistance patterns, acid suppression strategy, and expected eradication likelihood.",
            "solution": "The correct choice is determined by synthesizing the patient's allergy profile with local antibiotic resistance data.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option A (Correct):** This regimen (PPI + bismuth + tetracycline + metronidazole) is the recommended first-line treatment. It correctly avoids amoxicillin due to the patient's allergy and clarithromycin due to the high regional resistance ($>15\\%$). Bismuth quadruple therapy remains highly effective in this setting and is the standard of care. The 14-day duration and adequate dosing of metronidazole are crucial for maximizing efficacy.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option B (Incorrect):** This clarithromycin-based triple therapy is a poor choice. The local clarithromycin resistance rate of $25\\%$ predicts a high likelihood of treatment failure. The patient's recent macrolide (azithromycin) exposure further increases the individual risk of resistance.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option C (Incorrect):** Levofloxacin-based therapy is typically reserved for second-line or salvage therapy, not for first-line empiric use. This strategy helps to limit the development of fluoroquinolone resistance, preserving it for cases where other regimens have failed.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option D (Incorrect):** This regimen includes amoxicillin, which is absolutely contraindicated in a patient with a history of anaphylaxis to penicillin.\n\n*   **Analysis of Option E (Incorrect):** This option is not viable because vonoprazan is explicitly stated as being unavailable on the formulary.",

To isolate the early-phase dynamics of hemostasis at the ulcer crater, assume the following mechanistic model grounded in mass balance and first-order kinetics: define a time-dependent scalar measure of clot stability, $M(t)$, that increases due to ongoing clot formation driven by the bleeding stream and decreases due to fibrinolysis. Let clot formation proceed at a constant rate $r_{f}$ that is proportional to the bleeding rate $Q_{b}$ via an efficiency coefficient $\\gamma$, so $r_{f}=\\gamma\\,Q_{b}$. Let clot lysis follow first-order decay with a rate constant $k_{\\ell}$ that depends on gastric acidity.
