            "problem": "A patient with small bowel obstruction (SBO) develops high-volume luminal losses due to proximal stasis and nasogastric decompression. Over a $24$-hour interval, the measured small bowel fluid loss is $2.0$ liters. Laboratory analysis of the aspirate shows sodium concentration $[\\text{Na}^+] = 100$ millimolar (mM) and potassium concentration $[\\text{K}^+] = 10$ millimolar (mM). Assume that these losses reflect net removal of sodium and potassium from the body without renal compensation and that the ions are monovalent. Using the core definition of concentration, where $C$ is amount per unit volume, compute the total sodium and potassium deficits attributable to the luminal losses. Express each deficit in milliequivalents (mEq). Provide exact values; no rounding is required.

            "solution": "The pathophysiological mechanism in small bowel obstruction (SBO) includes sequestration of fluid and electrolytes into the lumen and increased proximal losses via nasogastric decompression.

            "problem": "A patient with a distal large-bowel obstruction develops progressive cecal distension. To rationalize the increased risk of perforation mechanistically, model the cecum as a thin-walled spherical organ with uniform wall thickness $t$ that does not change over the range of diameters considered. Assume the transmural pressure $P$ remains constant during the short time interval of distension. Starting from first principles of mechanical equilibrium (force balance) on a hemispherical shell, derive an expression for the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ in terms of $P$, the cecal radius $r$, and $t$. Then, use your derived expression to calculate the fold-change in wall stress when the cecal diameter increases from $8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ to $12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ under constant $P$ and constant $t$. Express the final result as a unitless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the circumferential wall stress in a thin-walled spherical organ and a subsequent calculation of the fold-change in this stress as the organ distends.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Circumferential Wall Stress ($\\sigma$)**\n\nTo determine the circumferential stress $\\sigma$ in the wall of the spherical cecum, we analyze the forces acting on one hemisphere of the sphere. Imagine cutting the sphere of radius $r$ into two equal halves. The transmural pressure $P$ acts on the internal circular face of this conceptual cut, creating a force that tends to push the two hemispheres apart.\n\nThis separating force, $F_{pressure}$, is the product of the pressure $P$ and the projected area over which it acts, which is the area of a great circle of the sphere, $A_{circle} = \\pi r^2$.\n$$F_{pressure} = P \\cdot A_{circle} = P \\pi r^2$$\n\nThis separating force is balanced by the internal stress in the material of the wall, which acts along the circumference of the cut. This resisting force, $F_{wall}$, is the product of the circumferential wall stress $\\sigma$ and the cross-sectional area of the wall material, $A_{wall}$.\n\nSince the wall is assumed to be thin (i.e., thickness $t \\ll r$), the cross-sectional area of the wall can be approximated as the circumference of the sphere multiplied by the wall thickness $t$.\n$$A_{wall} \\approx (2 \\pi r) t$$\n\nThe total resisting force is therefore:\n$$F_{wall} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{wall} = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nFor the hemisphere to be in mechanical equilibrium, the separating force must be equal to the resisting force:\n$$F_{pressure} = F_{wall}$$\n$$P \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2 \\pi r t)$$\n\nWe can now solve for the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r t}$$\nCanceling terms ($\\pi$ and one factor of $r$), we arrive at the expression for circumferential stress in a thin-walled sphere, also known as the Law of Laplace for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2t}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Fold-Change in Wall Stress**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the fold-change in wall stress when the cecal diameter increases from $d_1 = 8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ to $d_2 = 12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$. The problem states that the transmural pressure $P$ and the wall thickness $t$ remain constant during this distension.\n\nThe initial radius is $r_1 = \\frac{d_1}{2} = \\frac{8 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\nThe final radius is $r_2 = \\frac{d_2}{2} = \\frac{12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{2} = 6 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nLet $\\sigma_1$ be the initial stress at radius $r_1$, and $\\sigma_2$ be the final stress at radius $r_2$. Using the derived formula:\n$$\\sigma_1 = \\frac{P r_1}{2t}$$\n$$\\sigma_2 = \\frac{P r_2}{2t}$$\n\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the final stress to the initial stress, $\\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1}$.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\sigma_2}{\\sigma_1} = \\frac{\\frac{P r_2}{2t}}{\\frac{P r_1}{2t}}$$\n\nSince $P$ and $t$ are constant, they cancel out from the ratio:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{r_2}{r_1}$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values for the radii:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{6 \\ \\mathrm{cm}}{4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = 1.500$$\nThis result demonstrates that for a given pressure, the wall stress increases linearly with the radius. This explains why the cecum, being the part of the colon with the largest diameter, experiences the highest wall stress and is therefore at the greatest risk of perforation during a distal obstruction.",
