            "introduction": "The cascade of appendicitis begins with luminal obstruction, which transforms the appendix into a closed, distending container. This practice applies fundamental physics to model this initial event, using the Law of Laplace ($T = Pr$) to relate intraluminal pressure ($P$) and appendiceal radius ($r$) to the tension ($T$) in the wall. By calculating the dramatic increase in wall tension during obstruction, you will gain a quantitative appreciation for the physical stress that initiates ischemic injury. ",

            "problem": "Acutely inflamed appendices under luminal obstruction accumulate gas and secretions, raising intraluminal pressure and causing distension. Model the appendix as a thin-walled cylindrical tube of radius $r$, length $L$, and uniform wall thickness small compared to $r$, with uniform internal pressure $P$. Using static force balance (Newton’s First Law) and the definition of pressure as force per area, derive the relationship between the circumferential wall tension per unit length $T$ and the variables $P$ and $r$ for this thin-walled cylindrical geometry. Then, applying the derived relationship, compute the change in wall tension as the appendiceal diameter increases from $5\\ \\text{mm}$ to $9\\ \\text{mm}$ while intraluminal pressure rises from $20\\ \\text{mmHg}$ to $40\\ \\text{mmHg}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires two parts: first, to derive the relationship between circumferential wall tension per unit length ($T$), internal pressure ($P$), and radius ($r$) for a thin-walled cylinder, and second, to calculate the change in this tension for given physiological parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Relationship between $T$, $P$, and $r$**\n\nWe model the appendix as a thin-walled cylinder of length $L$ and radius $r$. The internal pressure $P$ exerts an outward force on the cylinder wall. We analyze the forces in static equilibrium by conceptually splitting the cylinder in half along its longitudinal axis.\n\nConsider a section of the cylinder of length $L$. The force exerted by the pressure $P$ that tends to separate the two halves of the cylinder acts on the projected rectangular area of the internal surface. This projected area, $A_{proj}$, is given by the diameter ($2r$) multiplied by the length ($L$):\n$$A_{proj} = (2r)L$$\n\nThe total outward force, $F_{pressure}$, due to the internal pressure is the pressure multiplied by this projected area:\n$$F_{pressure} = P \\cdot A_{proj} = P(2rL)$$\n\nThis outward force is counteracted by the circumferential (or hoop) tension in the cylinder wall. The tension $T$ is defined as force per unit length. This tension acts along the two cut edges of the wall, each of length $L$. Therefore, the total length over which the tension acts is $2L$. The total restraining force from the wall tension, $F_{tension}$, is:\n$$F_{tension} = T \\cdot (2L)$$\n\nFor the cylinder to be in static equilibrium (as stated by the use of static force balance, i.e., Newton's First Law), the sum of the forces must be zero. The outward force from pressure must be exactly balanced by the inward restraining force from the wall tension:\n$$\\sum F = 0$$\n$$F_{pressure} - F_{tension} = 0$$\n$$F_{pressure} = F_{tension}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the forces:\n$$P(2rL) = T(2L)$$\n\nWe can cancel the term $2L$ from both sides of the equation, as $L$ is non-zero. This yields the relationship between tension, pressure, and radius:\n$$T = Pr$$\nThis is a form of the Young-Laplace equation specifically for a thin-walled cylinder, often referred to as Barlow's formula.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Wall Tension**\n\nWe are given two states for the appendix: an initial state ($1$) and a final, more distended state ($2$). We must calculate the tension in each state and find the difference, $\\Delta T = T_2 - T_1$. First, we convert all given values to base SI units (meters for length, Pascals for pressure).\n\nThe conversion factors are:\n$1\\ \\text{mmHg} = 1.33322 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n$1\\ \\text{mm} = 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$\n\n**Initial State (1):**\nDiameter $d_1 = 5\\ \\text{mm} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$.
