The reversible binding reaction is given by:\n$$ H + B \\rightleftharpoons HB $$\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the general derivation, and second, the numerical calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Equilibrium Relationships**\n\nWe are given two fundamental principles to apply: the law of mass action and the conservation of mass.\n\n1.  **Law of Mass Action**: The equilibrium state of the reaction is described by the dissociation constant, $K_d$. It is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the dissociated species to the concentration of the complex at equilibrium.\n    $$ K_d = \\frac{[H][B]}{[HB]} \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Mass**: The total concentration of the hormone, $H_T$, is the sum of the free hormone and the bound hormone. Similarly, the total concentration of the binding protein, $B_T$, is the sum of the free binding protein and the bound binding protein.\n    $$ H_T = [H] + [HB] \\quad \\quad (2) $$\n    $$ B_T = [B] + [HB] \\quad \\quad (3) $$\n\nOur goal is to derive an equation that relates the free hormone concentration, $[H]$, to the known total concentrations, $H_T$ and $B_T$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. We can achieve this by expressing $[B]$ and $[HB]$ in terms of $[H]$ and the known constants.\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express the concentration of the bound complex, $[HB]$, as:\n$$ [HB] = H_T - [H] \\quad \\quad (4) $$\n\nFrom equation (3), we can express the concentration of the free binding protein, $[B]$, as:\n$$ [B] = B_T - [HB] \\quad \\quad (5) $$\nSubstituting equation (4) into equation (5) gives:\n$$ [B] = B_T - (H_T - [H]) = B_T - H_T + [H] \\quad \\quad (6) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[HB]$ from equation (4) and $[B]$ from equation (6) into the law of mass action expression, equation (1):\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[H](B_T - H_T + [H])}{H_T - [H]} $$\n\nTo solve for an unknown concentration, it is standard to rearrange this into a polynomial form. We multiply both sides by $(H_T - [H])$:\n$$ K_d (H_T - [H]) = [H](B_T - H_T + [H]) $$\nExpanding both sides gives:\n$$ K_d H_T - K_d [H] = [H]B_T - [H]H_T + [H]^2 $$\n\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation of the form $a[H]^2 + b[H] + c = 0$:\n$$ [H]^2 + (B_T - H_T)[H] + K_d[H] - K_d H_T = 0 $$\n$$ [H]^2 + (B_T - H_T + K_d)[H] - K_d H_T = 0 \\quad \\quad (7) $$\nThis is the desired general relationship connecting the free hormone concentration $[H]$ to the parameters $H_T$, $B_T$, and $K_d$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Free Cortisol Concentration**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nTotal cortisol concentration, $H_T = 500\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$\nTotal CBG concentration, $B_T = 700\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$\nDissociation constant, $K_d = 40\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n\nThe units are consistent, allowing us to work directly with the numerical values. The quadratic equation (7) for the free cortisol concentration $[H]$ has the following coefficients:\n$a = 1$\n$b = B_T - H_T + K_d = 700 - 500 + 40 = 240$\n$c = -K_d H_T = -(40)(500) = -20000$\n\nThe specific quadratic equation to be solved is:\n$$ [H]^2 + 240[H] - 20000 = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this using the quadratic formula, $[H] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ [H] = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{(240)^2 - 4(1)(-20000)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ [H] = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{57600 + 80000}}{2} $$\n$$ [H] = \\frac{-240 \\pm \\sqrt{137600}}{2} $$\n\nThe concentration of a chemical species must be a non-negative real number. Therefore, we must select the positive root of the solution.\n$$ [H] = \\frac{-240 + \\sqrt{137600}}{2} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{137600} \\approx 370.94474 $$\n$$ [H] \\approx \\frac{-240 + 370.94474}{2} = \\frac{130.94474}{2} \\approx 65.47237\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ [H] \\approx 65.47\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L} $$\nThis value represents the equilibrium concentration of free cortisol under the specified conditions.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as the ratio of occupied receptors, $[RL]$, to the total number of receptors, $B_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{B_{\\max}}\n$$\nWe start with the two given equations:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\max} = [R] + [RL] \\quad (2)\n$$\nFrom equation $(2)$, we express the free receptor concentration $[R]$ as:\n$$\n[R] = B_{\\max} - [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{(B_{\\max} - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nWe now solve for $[RL]$:\n$$\nK_d [RL] = (B_{\\max} - [RL])[L]\n$$\n$$\nK_d [RL] = B_{\\max}[L] - [RL][L]\n$$\n$$\nK_d [RL] + [RL][L] = B_{\\max}[L]\n$$\n$$\n[RL] (K_d + [L]) = B_{\\max}[L]\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{B_{\\max}[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nNow, we can find the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ by dividing by $B_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{B_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{B_{\\max}} \\left( \\frac{B_{\\max}[L]}{K_d + [L]} \\right) = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional receptor occupancy.\n\nNext, we compute the fractional occupancy at the physiological insulin concentration, $[L] = [I]_{\\mathrm{phys}} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{nM}$, given $K_d = 0.50\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{phys}} = \\frac{[I]_{\\mathrm{phys}}}{K_d + [I]_{\\mathrm{phys}}} = \\frac{0.10\\ \\mathrm{nM}}{0.50\\ \\mathrm{nM} + 0.10\\ \\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.60} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nThe second part of the task is to compute the number of occupied receptors per cell. This is the product of the fractional occupancy $\\theta_{\\mathrm{phys}}$ and the total number of receptors per cell $B_{\\max}$.\n$$\n\\text{Number of occupied receptors} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{phys}} \\times B_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times (2.4 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{sites\\,cell^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Number of occupied receptors} = 0.4 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{sites\\,cell^{-1}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{sites\\,cell^{-1}}\n$$\nThe third part is to predict the glucose uptake rate, $E_{\\mathrm{pred}}$, at $[I]_{\\mathrm{phys}}$. The problem states to assume a linear transduction mechanism where the glucose uptake rate, $E$, is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$.\n$$\nE = k \\cdot \\theta\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.

We are given $E_{\\mathrm{obs}} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,min^{-1}\\,cell^{-1}}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{obs}}}{E_{\\mathrm{pred}}} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,min^{-1}\\,cell^{-1}}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\,min^{-1}\\,cell^{-1}}} = \\frac{4.8}{1.2} = 4.0\n$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR = 4.000\n$$\nThe fact that $R > 1$ indicates that the observed biological response is greater than what would be predicted by a simple linear relationship between receptor occupancy and response. This suggests the presence of a non-linear signaling mechanism, such as signal amplification or the existence of \"spare receptors,\" where maximal response is achieved before all receptors are occupied.",

Consider hypothalamic Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone (TRH), denoted by $R$, pituitary Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), denoted by $P$, and peripheral thyroid hormone, denoted by $T$. At a normal baseline steady state, the concentrations are $R_0$, $P_0$, and $T_0$, respectively, with production rates balancing clearance rates.

It presents a standard, linearized model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, a valid construct in pathophysiology for analyzing small deviations from homeostasis.

The hypothalamic hormone $R$ is regulated by negative feedback from the peripheral hormone $T$. A fractional change in $T$ causes an opposite fractional change in $R$. This is described by the hypothalamic negative feedback gain $g_R$:\n    $$r = -g_R t \\quad (1)$$\n\n2.  The pituitary hormone $P$ is regulated by two inputs: feed-forward stimulation from $R$ and negative feedback from $T$. For small, additive changes, the total fractional change in $P$ is the sum of the effects from $R$ and $T$. The hypothalamic-to-pituitary feed-forward gain is $g_{RP}$, and the pituitary direct negative feedback gain is $g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})}$. This gives:\n    $$p = g_{RP} r - g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})} t \\quad (2)$$\n\n3.  The peripheral hormone $T$ is produced by the thyroid gland under stimulation from $P$. The problem states that primary hypoactivity reduces the gland's secretory capacity to a fraction $\\alpha$ of normal. This means that for any given level of stimulus $P$, the production rate of $T$ is $\\alpha$ times the normal rate. Let the production rate of $T$ be $S_T$ and the clearance rate be $C_T$. At steady state, $S_T = C_T$. We assume clearance is a first-order process, $C_T = k_T T$, where $k_T$ is the clearance constant. The production rate is a function of $P$, so $S_T = \\kappa f(P)$, where $\\kappa$ represents the gland's secretory capacity.\n    - At the normal baseline: $\\kappa = 1$, $P = P_0$, $T = T_0$. The steady state is $f(P_0) = k_T T_0$.\n    - In the new pathological state: the capacity is reduced to $\\kappa = \\alpha$, and the new steady state is at $P = P_0 + \\Delta P$ and $T = T_0 + \\Delta T$. The new balance is $\\alpha f(P_0 + \\Delta P) = k_T (T_0 + \\Delta T)$.\n    - For small changes, we linearize $f(P)$ around $P_0$: $f(P_0 + \\Delta P) \\approx f(P_0) + f'(P_0)\\Delta P$.\n    - Substituting this into the new steady-state equation: $\\alpha (f(P_0) + f'(P_0)\\Delta P) = k_T (T_0 + \\Delta T)$.\n    - Using the baseline condition $f(P_0) = k_T T_0$, we get: $\\alpha k_T T_0 + \\alpha f'(P_0)\\Delta P = k_T T_0 + k_T \\Delta T$.\n    - Dividing by $k_T T_0$: $\\alpha + \\alpha \\frac{f'(P_0)P_0}{k_T T_0} \\frac{\\Delta P}{P_0} = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta T}{T_0}$.\n    - The pituitary-to-peripheral gain $g_{PT}$ is defined for a normal gland ($\\alpha=1$) as relating the fractional change in $P$ to the fractional change in $T$, i.e., $t = g_{PT} p$. From the linearization, it can be shown that $g_{PT} = \\frac{f'(P_0)P_0}{k_T T_0}$.\n    - Substituting $g_{PT}$ into our equation: $\\alpha + \\alpha g_{PT} p = 1 + t$.\n    - Rearranging for $t$ gives our third equation:\n    $$t = \\alpha g_{PT} p + (\\alpha - 1) \\quad (3)$$\n\nWe now have a system of three linear equations for the three unknowns $r$, $p$, and $t$. Our goal is to solve for $r$ and $p$.\n\nFirst, substitute equation (1) into equation (2) to eliminate $r$:\n$$p = g_{RP}(-g_R t) - g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})} t$$\n$$p = -(g_{RP} g_R + g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})}) t$$\nLet's call the total feedback gain on the pituitary and hypothalamus $G = g_{RP} g_R + g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})}$.\n$$p = -G t \\quad (4)$$\n\nNext, we have a system of two equations with $p$ and $t$:\n(3): $t = \\alpha g_{PT} p + (\\alpha - 1)$\n(4): $p = -G t$\n\nSubstitute equation (3) into equation (4):\n$$p = -G (\\alpha g_{PT} p + (\\alpha - 1))$$\n$$p = -G \\alpha g_{PT} p - G(\\alpha - 1)$$\n\nNow, we solve for $p$:\n$$p + G \\alpha g_{PT} p = -G(\\alpha - 1)$$\n$$p(1 + \\alpha g_{PT} G) = G(1 - \\alpha)$$\n$$p = \\frac{G(1 - \\alpha)}{1 + \\alpha g_{PT} G}$$\nSubstituting back $G = g_{RP} g_R + g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})}$, we find the expression for $p = \\Delta P/P_0$:\n$$p = \\frac{(g_{RP} g_R + g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})})(1 - \\alpha)}{1 + \\alpha g_{PT} (g_{RP} g_R + g_P^{(\\mathrm{fb})})}$$\n\nTo find $r$, we first find $t$ from equation (4): $t = -p/G$.
