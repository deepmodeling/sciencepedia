You will use the foundational definitions of binary classification and confusion matrices to derive performance metrics without invoking any shortcut formulas beyond those definitions.\n\nThe following tallies summarize IHC results by true diagnosis:\n\n1. BerEP4 as a test for BCC (treating “BCC” as the positive class and “not-BCC” as the negative class):\n- Among true BCC ($n=60$): BerEP4 positive $55$, BerEP4 negative $5$.\n- Among true SCC ($n=50$): BerEP4 positive $3$, BerEP4 negative $47$.\n- Among true melanoma ($n=70$): BerEP4 positive $1$, BerEP4 negative $69$.\n\n2. p63 as a test for SCC (treating “SCC” as the positive class and “not-SCC” as the negative class):\n- Among true SCC ($n=50$): p63 positive $45$, p63 negative $5$.\n- Among true BCC ($n=60$): p63 positive $6$, p63 negative $54$.\n- Among true melanoma ($n=70$): p63 positive $2$, p63 negative $68$.\n\n3. A melanocytic panel for melanoma comprising S100, SOX10, and Melan-A, with a majority-rule algorithm that calls “melanoma” when at least two of the three markers are positive (treating “melanoma” as the positive class and “non-melanoma” as the negative class). The distribution of the number of positive melanocytic markers per case is:\n- Among true melanoma ($n=70$): exactly $3$ markers positive $46$ cases; exactly $2$ markers positive $17$ cases; exactly $1$ marker positive $6$ cases; exactly $0$ markers positive $1$ case.\n- Among true BCC ($n=60$): exactly $0$ markers positive $56$ cases; exactly $1$ marker positive $3$ cases; exactly $2$ markers positive $1$ case; exactly $3$ markers positive $0$ cases.\n- Among true SCC ($n=50$): exactly $0$ markers positive $48$ cases; exactly $1$ marker positive $2$ cases; exactly $2$ markers positive $0$ cases; exactly $3$ markers positive $0$ cases.\n\nStarting from the core definitions of a binary confusion matrix and the definitions of sensitivity and specificity, first conceptualize how to construct the confusion matrix for the melanocytic majority-rule panel against the “melanoma” versus “non-melanoma” ground truth using the counts above.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the specificity of a diagnostic test for melanoma. The test is a panel of three immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers, and the diagnosis is considered positive for melanoma if at least two of the three markers are positive. We must derive this from the fundamental definitions of a confusion matrix and specificity.\n\nFirst, let us define the components of a binary confusion matrix. A confusion matrix tabulates the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known. For a binary classification problem, there are four possible outcomes:\n- **True Positive ($TP$)**: The test correctly identifies a case as positive when the true condition is positive.\n- **False Positive ($FP$)**: The test incorrectly identifies a case as positive when the true condition is negative.\n- **True Negative ($TN$)**: The test correctly identifies a case as negative when the true condition is negative.\n- **False Negative ($FN$)**: The test incorrectly identifies a case as negative when the true condition is positive.\n\nThe total number of actual positive cases is $P = TP + FN$. The total number of actual negative cases is $N = TN + FP$.\n\nThe two primary performance metrics derived from this matrix are sensitivity and specificity.\n- **Sensitivity** (also known as the true positive rate) is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. It is defined as:\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{TP}{P} $$\n- **Specificity** (also known as the true negative rate) is the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such. It is defined as:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{TN}{N} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the specificity of the melanocytic panel for melanoma. To calculate this, we must first establish the confusion matrix for this specific test.\n\n**Step 1: Define the Positive and Negative Classes**\n- **Positive Condition**: The true diagnosis is melanoma.\n- **Negative Condition**: The true diagnosis is non-melanoma. The non-melanoma group in this cohort consists of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Actual Positives and Negatives**\n- The number of actual positives ($P$) is the total number of true melanoma cases: $P = 70$.\n- The number of actual negatives ($N$) is the total number of non-melanoma cases: $N = (\\text{number of BCC}) + (\\text{number of SCC}) = 60 + 50 = 110$.\n\n**Step 3: Define the Test's Positive and Negative Criteria**\nThe panel uses a majority-rule algorithm.\n- **Test Positive**: A case is considered positive for melanoma if at least $2$ of the $3$ markers are positive (i.e., exactly $2$ or exactly $3$ markers are positive).\n- **Test Negative**: A case is considered negative for melanoma if fewer than $2$ markers are positive (i.e., exactly $0$ or exactly $1$ marker is positive).\n\n**Step 4: Calculate $TP$, $FN$, $TN$, and $FP$ from the Given Data**\n\n- **$TP$ (True Positives)**: These are true melanoma cases that test positive. We sum the melanoma cases with $\\ge 2$ positive markers.\nFrom the data for true melanoma ($n=70$):\nNumber of cases with $3$ positive markers = $46$.\nNumber of cases with $2$ positive markers = $17$.\n$$ TP = 46 + 17 = 63 $$\n\n- **$FN$ (False Negatives)**: These are true melanoma cases that test negative. We sum the melanoma cases with $< 2$ positive markers.\nFrom the data for true melanoma ($n=70$):\nNumber of cases with $1$ positive marker = $6$.\nNumber of cases with $0$ positive markers = $1$.\n$$ FN = 6 + 1 = 7 $$\nCheck: $TP + FN = 63 + 7 = 70$, which is the total number of true melanoma cases.\n\n- **$TN$ (True Negatives)**: These are true non-melanoma cases that test negative. We must sum the results from both BCC and SCC groups for cases with $< 2$ positive markers.\nFrom the data for true BCC ($n=60$):\nNumber of cases with $1$ positive marker = $3$.\nNumber of cases with $0$ positive markers = $56$.\nNumber of test-negative BCC cases = $3 + 56 = 59$.\n\nFrom the data for true SCC ($n=50$):\nNumber of cases with $1$ positive marker = $2$.\nNumber of cases with $0$ positive markers = $48$.\nNumber of test-negative SCC cases = $2 + 48 = 50$.\n\nTotal number of True Negatives:\n$$ TN = 59 \\text{ (from BCC)} + 50 \\text{ (from SCC)} = 109 $$\n\n- **$FP$ (False Positives)**: These are true non-melanoma cases that test positive. We sum the results from both BCC and SCC groups for cases with $\\ge 2$ positive markers.\nFrom the data for true BCC ($n=60$):\nNumber of cases with $2$ positive markers = $1$.\nNumber of cases with $3$ positive markers = $0$.\nNumber of test-positive BCC cases = $1 + 0 = 1$.\n\nFrom the data for true SCC ($n=50$):\nNumber of cases with $2$ positive markers = $0$.\nNumber of cases with $3$ positive markers = $0$.\nNumber of test-positive SCC cases = $0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nTotal number of False Positives:\n$$ FP = 1 \\text{ (from BCC)} + 0 \\text{ (from SCC)} = 1 $$\nCheck: $TN + FP = 109 + 1 = 110$, which is the total number of non-melanoma cases.\n\n**Step 5: Conceptualize and Construct the Confusion Matrix**\nBased on these calculations, the confusion matrix is as follows:\n\n|              | Test Positive (Panel $\\ge 2$) | Test Negative (Panel $< 2$) | Total |\n| :---         | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **True Positive (Melanoma)** | $TP = 63$ | $FN = 7$  | $70$  |\n| **True Negative (Non-Melanoma)** | $FP = 1$  | $TN = 109$| $110$ |\n| **Total**    | $64$  | $116$ | $180$ |\n\n**Step 6: Calculate Specificity**\nUsing the definition of specificity and the values from our matrix:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{N} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\frac{109}{109 + 1} = \\frac{109}{110} $$\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{109}{110} \\approx 0.99090909... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 9, 0, 9$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we do not round up.\n$$ \\text{Specificity} \\approx 0.9909 $$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth edition tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging code for a patient with cutaneous melanoma, based on a set of provided clinical and pathological findings. The determination of the TNM code involves a systematic evaluation of the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastasis (M) categories.\n\n1.  **Determination of the T Category (Primary Tumor)**\n\nThe T category for cutaneous melanoma under the AJCC 8th edition is defined primarily by the Breslow thickness (the maximal vertical depth of invasion) and the presence or absence of ulceration.\n\nThe problem provides the following information for the T category:\n- Breslow thickness: $2.1$ mm.\n- Presence of ulceration: \"Histopathology documents ulceration of the primary lesion.\"\n\nThe AJCC 8th edition criteria for T categories are as follows:\n- $T_{1}$: Tumor thickness $\\le 1.0$ mm.\n- $T_{2}$: Tumor thickness $> 1.0$ mm but $\\le 2.0$ mm.\n- $T_{3}$: Tumor thickness $> 2.0$ mm but $\\le 4.0$ mm.\n- $T_{4}$: Tumor thickness $> 4.0$ mm.\n\nThe given Breslow thickness is $2.1$ mm. This value satisfies the condition for the $T_{3}$ category, as $2.0 < 2.1 \\le 4.0$.\n\nFurthermore, the T categories are sub-classified based on the presence of ulceration:\n- Suffix 'a' indicates no ulceration.\n- Suffix 'b' indicates the presence of ulceration.\n\nThe problem explicitly states that ulceration is present. Therefore, the suffix 'b' is applied to the T category.\n\nCombining the thickness-based category ($T_{3}$) with the ulceration-based suffix ('b'), the correct T category is $T_{3b}$.\n\n2.  **Determination of the N Category (Regional Lymph Nodes)**\n\nThe N category is determined by the number of metastatic regional lymph nodes, whether the metastases are detected clinically (macroscopic) or only on pathology (microscopic/occult), and the presence of in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n\nThe problem provides the following information for the N category:\n- Number of metastatic nodes: \"metastatic melanoma in exactly one node\".\n- Method of detection: \"detected only by histopathology without prior clinical or radiologic detection\". This signifies microscopic or occult nodal disease, often identified via sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n- Presence of other metastases: \"no in-transit or satellite metastases\".\n\nThe AJCC 8th edition criteria for the relevant N categories are:\n- $N_{0}$: No regional lymph node metastases.\n- $N_{1}$: Metastasis in one lymph node; or in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases with no regional lymph node metastases.\n  - $N_{1a}$: One clinically occult (i.e., microscopic) lymph node metastasis.\n  - $N_{1b}$: One clinically detected (i.e., macroscopic) lymph node metastasis.\n  - $N_{1c}$: No regional lymph node metastases, but presence of in-transit, satellite, or microsatellite metastases.\n- $N_{2}$: Metastasis in two or three lymph nodes, or other combinations.\n\nThe patient has metastasis in exactly one lymph node, which points to an $N_{1}$ category. The metastasis was detected \"only by histopathology,\" which is the definition of clinically occult disease. This specifies the sub-category as 'a'. The absence of in-transit or satellite metastases further confirms that the staging is not complicated by the 'c' designator.\n\nTherefore, the correct N category is $N_{1a}$.\n\n3.  **Determination of the M Category (Distant Metastasis)**\n\nThe M category describes the presence or absence of distant metastases, i.e., spread to distant skin, lymph nodes, or internal organs.\n\nThe problem provides the following information for the M category:\n- \"Staging imaging finds no evidence of distant metastasis.\"\n\nThe AJCC 8th edition criteria for the M category are straightforward:\n- $M_{0}$: No evidence of distant metastasis.\n- $M_{1}$: Evidence of distant metastasis.\n\nSince there is no evidence of distant metastasis, the correct M category is $M_{0}$.\n\n4.  **Final Assembly of the TNM Code**\n\nBy combining the individual categories determined above, the complete AJCC TNM code is formed.\n\n- T Category: $T_{3b}$\n- N Category: $N_{1a}$\n- M Category: $M_{0}$\n\nThe final TNM code is the concatenation of these components.",

From a mechanistic standpoint, cumulative UV exposure induces cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in keratinocytes, leading to characteristic tumor protein p53 (*TP53*) UV-signature mutations that increase malignant transformation risk. In the adult population, UV exposure is stratified into three mutually exclusive categories relative to a low-exposure reference: low (reference), moderate, and high. Let the reference category have a relative risk of SCC of $1$ by definition. Assume the following are accurate and apply to SCC incidence over a specified period in a stable population:\n- The prevalence of moderate exposure is $p_{\\mathrm{mod}} = 0.4$ and the prevalence of high exposure is $p_{\\mathrm{high}} = 0.2$, so the prevalence of the low-exposure reference category is $p_{\\mathrm{low}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{mod}} - p_{\\mathrm{high}}$.\n- The causal relative risk for SCC is $RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} = 2.0$ for moderate exposure and $RR_{\\mathrm{high}} = 5.0$ for high exposure, each relative to the low-exposure reference.\n- Let $I_{0}$ denote the baseline SCC incidence that would apply to everyone if all were in the low-exposure reference category, and let the observed population incidence be the prevalence-weighted sum of stratum-specific incidences.\n- Assume no uncontrolled confounding, effect modification, or competing risk alterations, and assume the relative risks transport directly to incidence in this population.\n\nUsing only fundamental epidemiological definitions (for example, defining the population attributable fraction as the proportion of the observed population incidence that would be eliminated if the exposure were set to the low-exposure reference in everyone), derive the expression for the population attributable fraction of SCC due to UV exposure across the moderate and high exposure categories, and then compute its value using the parameters above.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the population attributable fraction (PAF) for Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) due to moderate and high UV exposure.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between stratum-specific incidence, baseline incidence $I_{0}$, and relative risk ($RR$). The incidence in an exposure stratum $j$ ($I_j$) is given by the product of the reference incidence $I_0$ and the relative risk for that stratum $RR_j$.\n- Incidence in low-exposure stratum: $I_{\\mathrm{low}} = RR_{\\mathrm{low}} \\cdot I_{0} = 1 \\cdot I_{0} = I_{0}$.\n- Incidence in moderate-exposure stratum: $I_{\\mathrm{mod}} = RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} \\cdot I_{0}$.\n- Incidence in high-exposure stratum: $I_{\\mathrm{high}} = RR_{\\mathrm{high}} \\cdot I_{0}$.\n\nThe observed population incidence, $I_{\\text{obs}}$, is the prevalence-weighted average of the stratum-specific incidences:\n$$I_{\\text{obs}} = p_{\\mathrm{low}} I_{\\mathrm{low}} + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} I_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} I_{\\mathrm{high}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for each $I_j$ in terms of $I_0$:\n$$I_{\\text{obs}} = p_{\\mathrm{low}}(I_{0}) + p_{\\mathrm{mod}}(RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} \\cdot I_{0}) + p_{\\mathrm{high}}(RR_{\\mathrm{high}} \\cdot I_{0})$$\nFactoring out the baseline incidence $I_{0}$:\n$$I_{\\text{obs}} = I_{0} (p_{\\mathrm{low}} + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} RR_{\\mathrm{high}})$$\n\nThe population attributable fraction (PAF) is defined as the proportion of cases that would be prevented if the risk factor were eliminated. In this context, \"elimination\" means setting the exposure for the moderate and high groups to the low-exposure reference level.\nThe incidence in this counterfactual scenario, where the entire population experiences the low-exposure risk, would be $I_{0}$. The number of cases attributable to the exposure is the difference between the observed cases and the counterfactual cases, which is proportional to $I_{\\text{obs}} - I_{0}$. The PAF is the ratio of these attributable cases to the total observed cases:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{\\text{obs}} - I_{0}}{I_{\\text{obs}}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_{0}}{I_{\\text{obs}}}$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $I_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_{0}}{I_{0} (p_{\\mathrm{low}} + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} RR_{\\mathrm{high}})}$$\nThe term $I_{0}$ cancels out, demonstrating that the PAF is independent of the baseline incidence:\n$$PAF = 1 - \\frac{1}{p_{\\mathrm{low}} + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} RR_{\\mathrm{high}}}$$\nThe denominator term $(p_{\\mathrm{low}} + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} RR_{\\mathrm{high}})$ is the prevalence-weighted average relative risk for the population, often denoted $\\overline{RR}$, where the relative risk for the reference category is 1.\n\nNow, we compute the value of the PAF using the given parameters.\nFirst, we calculate the prevalence of the low-exposure group:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{low}} = 1 - p_{\\mathrm{mod}} - p_{\\mathrm{high}} = 1 - 0.4 - 0.2 = 0.4$$\nNext, we calculate the prevalence-weighted average relative risk for the population ($\\overline{RR}$):\n$$\\overline{RR} = p_{\\mathrm{low}}(RR_{\\mathrm{low}}) + p_{\\mathrm{mod}} RR_{\\mathrm{mod}} + p_{\\mathrm{high}} RR_{\\mathrm{high}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\overline{RR} = (0.4)(1) + (0.4)(2.0) + (0.2)(5.0)$$\n$$\\overline{RR} = 0.4 + 0.8 + 1.0 = 2.2$$\nThe PAF can be calculated using the formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{\\overline{RR} - 1}{\\overline{RR}}$$\nFinally, we compute the PAF:\n$$PAF = \\frac{2.2 - 1}{2.2} = \\frac{1.2}{2.2} = \\frac{12}{22} = \\frac{6}{11}$$\nAs a decimal fraction, this is:\n$$PAF \\approx 0.545454...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$PAF \\approx 0.5455$$\nThis means that approximately $54.55\\%$ of the SCC cases in this population are attributable to having moderate or high UV exposure compared to the low-exposure reference level.",
