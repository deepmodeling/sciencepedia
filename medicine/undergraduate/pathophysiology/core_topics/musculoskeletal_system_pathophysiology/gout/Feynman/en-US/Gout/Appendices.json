The definitions of $pH$, $pK_a$, and $K_a$ are standard. The provided values for the $pK_a$ of uric acid and the $pH$ of synovial fluid are physiologically and biochemically realistic. The principle that ionized species exhibit higher aqueous solubility than their neutral counterparts is a well-established concept in physical chemistry. The problem is firmly grounded in established science.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information ($pK_a$ and two $pH$ values) to calculate the required ratios and fractions. It asks for a specific derivation and a logical inference based on the results.

It contains no discernible flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe primary goal is to determine the ratio of the conjugate base concentration to the weak acid concentration, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$, at two different $pH$ values. We can derive a general expression for this ratio from the given definitions.\n\nStarting with the definition of the acid dissociation constant:\n$$K_a = \\dfrac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$$\nWe can rearrange this to isolate the desired ratio:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = \\dfrac{K_a}{[H^+]}$$\nTo express this in terms of $pK_a$ and $pH$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{K_a}{[H^+]}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\log(x/y) = \\log(x) - \\log(y)$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) = \\log_{10}(K_a) - \\log_{10}([H^+])$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $-1$:\n$$-\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) = -\\log_{10}(K_a) - (-\\log_{10}([H^+]))$$\nUsing the property $-\\log(x) = \\log(1/x)$ and substituting the definitions $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[HA]}{[A^-]}\\right) = pK_a - pH$$\nThis is one form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. For our purpose, it is more convenient to use the form derived by rearranging the equation before multiplying by $-1$:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}\\right) = -pK_a + pH = pH - pK_a$$\nExponentiating both sides with base $10$ gives the final expression for the ratio:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(pH - pK_a)}$$\n\nNow, we can calculate this ratio for the two given $pH$ conditions, using $pK_a \\approx 5.4$.\n\n**Case 1: At rest, $pH \\approx 7.4$**\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(7.4 - 5.4)} = 10^2 = 100$$\nThe fraction of urate present as the conjugate base, $f_{A^-}$, is given by:\n$$f_{A^-} = \\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA] + [A^-]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$:\n$$f_{A^-} = \\dfrac{\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}} = \\dfrac{100}{1 + 100} = \\dfrac{100}{101}$$\n$$f_{A^-} \\approx 0.990099$$\nThis means approximately $99.0\\%$ of the total urate is in the ionized form, $A^-$.\n\n**Case 2: During inflammation, $pH \\approx 6.8$**\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} = 10^{(6.8 - 5.4)} = 10^{1.4}$$\nTo approximate $10^{1.4}$:\n$$10^{1.4} = 10^1 \\times 10^{0.4}$$\nSince $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.301$ and $\\log_{10}(3) \\approx 0.477$, $10^{0.4}$ is a value between $2$ and $3$. A more precise value is $10^{0.4} \\approx 2.5118...$. Therefore:\n$$\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 10 \\times 2.5118... \\approx 25.12$$\nSo, the ratio is approximately $25$.\n\nUsing this approximate ratio to find the fraction of urate as the conjugate base:\n$$f_{A^-} = \\dfrac{\\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}}{1 + \\frac{[A^-]}{[HA]}} \\approx \\dfrac{25}{1 + 25} = \\dfrac{25}{26}$$\n$$f_{A^-} \\approx 0.961538$$\nThis means approximately $96.2\\%$ of the total urate is in the ionized form, $A^-$.\n\n**Physiological Inference:**\nThe problem states that the ionized form ($A^-$) is more soluble than the neutral form ($HA$). Our calculations show that a decrease in $pH$ from $7.4$ to $6.8$ (acidification) causes the fraction of urate in the more soluble ionized form to decrease from $\\approx 99\\%$ to $\\approx 96\\%$. Concurrently, the fraction in the less soluble neutral form ($HA$) increases from $\\approx 1\\%$ (since $1/101 \\approx 0.01$) to $\\approx 4\\%$ (since $1/26 \\approx 0.038$). This four-fold increase in the concentration of the less soluble species, $[HA]$, for a fixed total urate pool $C_T$, reduces the overall capacity of the synovial fluid to keep urate dissolved. This increases the risk of precipitation of uric acid crystals, which is the pathological basis of gout.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $pH = 7.4$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 100$ (about $99\\%$ as $A^-$); at $pH = 6.8$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 25$ (about $96\\%$ as $A^-$). The modest acidification reduces the ionized fraction and thereby modestly lowers urate solubility, slightly increasing the risk of precipitation when total urate is near saturation.**\n- The calculated ratio at $pH=7.4$ is $100$. This matches.\n- The fraction as $A^-$ at $pH=7.4$ is $\\approx 99\\%$. This matches.\n- The calculated ratio at $pH=6.8$ is $\\approx 25.12$, which is well-approximated by $25$. This matches.\n- The fraction as $A^-$ at $pH=6.8$ is $\\approx 96\\%$. This matches.\n- The inference is correct: acidification reduces the ionized fraction, which lowers solubility and increases precipitation risk. The descriptors \"modest\" and \"slight\" are reasonable qualitative descriptions of the change from $99\\%$ to $96\\%$ ionized. This option aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. At $pH = 7.4$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 0.01$ (about $1\\%$ as $A^-$); at $pH = 6.8$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 0.04$ (about $4\\%$ as $A^-$). Acidification increases the ionized fraction and thus increases solubility, reducing precipitation risk.**\n- The calculated ratios are incorrect. These values correspond to the inverse ratio, $\\dfrac{[HA]}{[A^-]}$.\n- The inference that acidification *increases* the ionized fraction is contrary to Le Châtelier's principle and our calculation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. At both $pH = 7.4$ and $pH = 6.8$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]}$ remains $>100$ (about $>99\\%$ as $A^-$ at each). Therefore, changes in $pH$ in this range do not affect ionization or solubility in any meaningful way.**\n- The statement that the ratio at $pH=6.8$ is $>100$ is false. Our calculation shows it is $\\approx 25$.\n- Consequently, the conclusion that the change is not meaningful is based on a false premise.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. At $pH = 7.4$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 1$ (about $50\\%$ as $A^-$); at $pH = 6.8$, $\\dfrac{[A^-]}{[HA]} \\approx 0.5$ (about $33\\%$ as $A^-$). Acidification decreases the ionized fraction and lowers solubility, markedly increasing precipitation risk in this range.**\n- The calculated ratios are incorrect. A ratio of $\\approx 1$ would occur if $pH \\approx pK_a$, which is not the case here ($pH=7.4$ vs $pK_a=5.4$).\n- The numerical values are grossly inconsistent with the derivation.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation, only option A provides the correct numerical results and the correct physiological interpretation.",

It is a standard, formalizable problem in clinical medicine.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, and compute its value.\n\nThe renal clearance of any substance $x$, denoted $C_x$, is defined as the rate of its excretion in urine divided by its concentration in plasma. The excretion rate is the product of the urine concentration of the substance, $U_x$, and the urine flow rate, $V$.\n$$\nC_x = \\frac{U_x \\cdot V}{P_x}\n$$\nwhere $P_x$ is the plasma concentration of substance $x$.\n\nApplying this definition to urate, its clearance, $C_{\\text{urate}}$, is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the clearance of creatinine, $C_{\\text{Cr}}$, which is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), is given by:\n$$\nC_{\\text{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the fractional excretion of urate, $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$, as the ratio of urate clearance to creatinine clearance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{urate}}}{C_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\n\nWe now substitute the expressions for $C_{\\text{urate}}$ and $C_{\\text{Cr}}$ into the equation for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{U_{\\text{Cr}} \\cdot V}{P_{\\text{Cr}}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, is present in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be canceled. This is a critical feature, as it permits the calculation of fractional excretion from spot urine and plasma samples without requiring a timed urine collection to measure $V$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{U_{\\text{urate}}}{P_{\\text{urate}}} \\cdot \\frac{P_{\\text{Cr}}}{U_{\\text{Cr}}}\n$$\nThis is the required general expression for the fractional excretion of urate in terms of the four given concentration measurements.\n\n### Computation\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ using the provided data:\n- $U_{\\text{urate}} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{urate}} = 8 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $U_{\\text{Cr}} = 100 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- $P_{\\text{Cr}} = 1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40 \\text{ mg/dL}}{8 \\text{ mg/dL}} \\cdot \\frac{1 \\text{ mg/dL}}{100 \\text{ mg/dL}}\n$$\nThe units ($\\text{mg/dL}$) cancel, yielding a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a fractional ratio.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = \\frac{40}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{100} = 0.05\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.05$. To represent this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.05000$.\n\n### Clinical Interpretation\nFinally, we interpret this result in the context of gout pathophysiology. Hyperuricemia (elevated $P_{\\text{urate}}$) can result from two primary mechanisms: overproduction of urate or renal underexcretion of urate. The fractional excretion of urate helps differentiate these causes. The normal range for $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ is typically cited as $6\\%$ to $10\\%$ (or $0.06$ to $0.10$). In a patient with hyperuricemia, an $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}}$ below a certain threshold (commonly $< 6\\%$ or $0.06$) is considered evidence of renal underexcretion as the predominant cause. The kidney is failing to excrete an adequate fraction of the filtered urate load, leading to its accumulation in the plasma.\n\nOur calculated value is $\\mathrm{FE}_{\\text{urate}} = 0.05$, which corresponds to $5\\%$. Since $5\\% < 6\\%$, this result indicates that the patient is an \"underexcretor\" of urate. This finding is significant as underexcretion is the underlying cause of primary gout in approximately $90\\%$ of patients and can guide therapeutic choices, for instance, towards uricosuric agents which increase renal urate excretion.",

The solution is derived by working backward from the desired therapeutic effect to the required drug dose.\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional inhibition $I$ of Xanthine Oxidase (XO) needed to achieve the target urate level.

This begins with calculating the patient's creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) using the Cockcroft-Gault equation:\n$$\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - \\text{age}) \\times \\text{weight}}{72 \\times \\text{SCr}}$$\nSubstituting the patient's data:\n$$\\text{CrCl} = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 82}{72 \\times 1.8} \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{78 \\times 82}{129.6} \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} = \\frac{6396}{129.6} \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\approx 49.35 \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}}$$\n\nThe systemic clearance $CL$ of the inhibitory species is proportional to $CrCl$:\n$$CL = \\gamma \\cdot \\text{CrCl}$$\nUsing the given proportionality constant $\\gamma = 0.06$ L/h per mL/min:\n$$CL = 0.06 \\, \\frac{\\text{L/h}}{\\text{mL/min}} \\times 49.35185... \\, \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{min}} \\approx 2.961 \\, \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{h}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required daily dose $D$ using the steady-state average concentration formula:\n$$C = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nSolving for the dose $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{C \\cdot CL \\cdot \\tau}{F}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values and given constants ($C = \\frac{8}{3}$ mg/L, $CL \\approx 2.961$ L/h, $\\tau = 24$ h, and $F = 0.90$):\n$$D = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{8}{3} \\, \\text{mg/L}\\right) \\cdot \\left(2.96111... \\, \\text{L/h}\\right) \\cdot (24 \\, \\text{h})}{0.90}$$\n$$D = \\frac{189.511... \\, \\text{mg}}{0.90} \\approx 210.5679... \\, \\text{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D \\approx 211 \\, \\text{mg/day}$$",
