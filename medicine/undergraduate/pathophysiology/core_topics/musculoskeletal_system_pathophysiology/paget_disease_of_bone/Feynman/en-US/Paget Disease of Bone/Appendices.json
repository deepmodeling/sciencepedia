This exercise invites you to step into the role of a diagnostician, using Bayes' theorem to systematically update your belief in a diagnosis of Paget disease as new test results become available. By calculating posterior probabilities, you will gain a hands-on appreciation for how likelihood ratios, derived from test sensitivity and specificity, quantify the power of diagnostic evidence ().",

            "problem": "A clinician evaluates a $70$-year-old patient with focal bone pain and deformity suspicious for Paget disease of bone (osteitis deformans). Before ordering any tests, the clinician’s prior belief that the patient has Paget disease is $0.03$. Three diagnostic tests are considered, and for the purpose of this exercise you may assume conditional independence of test results given disease status, and that the patient’s actual test outcomes will be evaluated in the sequence listed. The tests and their operating characteristics are:\n- Serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase, ALP): sensitivity $0.80$, specificity $0.85$.\n- Bone scintigraphy (bone scan): sensitivity $0.95$, specificity $0.90$.\n- Targeted radiographs of symptomatic sites: sensitivity $0.90$, specificity $0.98$.\n\nThe patient’s sequential results are all positive: first a positive ALP, then a positive bone scan, then positive radiographs.\n\nStarting from the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem, and without using any prepackaged shortcuts, derive the sequential updating framework that maps prior probability to posterior probability after each positive test under the stated conditional independence assumption. Then compute the posterior probability of Paget disease immediately after each test result (after ALP, after bone scan, after radiographs). Express each posterior probability as an exact fraction. Provide your three results in the order specified. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin by recalling foundational definitions and Bayes’ theorem. Let $D$ denote the event that the patient has Paget disease, and $\\overline{D}$ denote its complement. For a given diagnostic test $T$ with binary result $T^{+}$ or $T^{-}$:\n- Sensitivity is $\\Pr(T^{+}\\mid D)$.\n- Specificity is $\\Pr(T^{-}\\mid \\overline{D})$.\n- Therefore, the false positive rate is $\\Pr(T^{+}\\mid \\overline{D})=1-\\text{specificity}$.\n\nBayes’ theorem for a single positive test gives\n$$\n\\Pr(D\\mid T^{+})=\\frac{\\Pr(T^{+}\\mid D)\\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T^{+}\\mid D)\\Pr(D)+\\Pr(T^{+}\\mid \\overline{D})\\Pr(\\overline{D})}.\n$$\nIt is often algebraically convenient to work with odds.
