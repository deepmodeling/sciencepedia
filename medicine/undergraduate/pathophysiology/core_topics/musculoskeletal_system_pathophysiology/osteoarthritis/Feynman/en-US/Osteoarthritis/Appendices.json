A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nAs required, we begin from the fundamental definition of a moment. A moment, or torque, $\\vec{M}$, about a point or axis of rotation is the rotational equivalent of a force. It is defined as the cross product of the lever arm vector $\\vec{r}$ (the position vector from the axis of rotation to the point of force application) and the force vector $\\vec{F}$:\n$$ \\vec{M} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F} $$\nThe magnitude of the moment, $M$, is given by $M = |\\vec{r}| |\\vec{F}| \\sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between the vectors $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$. This can be equivalently expressed as the product of the force magnitude, $F$, and the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force, known as the lever arm, $d_{\\perp}$.\n$$ M = F \\cdot d_{\\perp} $$\nIn the context of gait analysis, the Knee Adduction Moment ($KAM$) is the external moment acting in the frontal plane about the anteroposterior axis of the knee joint. This moment is primarily generated by the ground reaction force ($F_{GRF}$) acting on the foot during the stance phase of walking. The lever arm is the perpendicular distance from the knee joint center to the line of action of the $F_{GRF}$.\n\nThe problem provides a normalized value for the peak KAM, denoted as $KAM_{norm}$. This normalization is performed to create a dimensionless quantity that facilitates comparison across individuals of different sizes. The problem states that the KAM is reported as a percentage of body weight ($W$) times height ($H$). Let the absolute peak KAM be denoted by $KAM_{abs}$, which has units of Newton-meters ($\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$). The relationship between the normalized and absolute values is given by:\n$$ KAM_{norm} = \\frac{KAM_{abs}}{W \\times H} \\times 100\\% $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $W = 900 \\text{ N}$\n- $H = 1.7 \\text{ m}$\n- $KAM_{norm} = 3\\% $\n\nTo find the absolute peak KAM, $KAM_{abs}$, we must rearrange the normalization equation:\n$$ KAM_{abs} = \\frac{KAM_{norm}}{100} \\times (W \\times H) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation. The product of body weight and height serves as the normalization factor:\n$$ W \\times H = 900 \\text{ N} \\times 1.7 \\text{ m} = 1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\nUsing this factor, we can calculate $KAM_{abs}$:\n$$ KAM_{abs} = \\frac{3}{100} \\times (1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}) $$\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 0.03 \\times 1530 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 45.9 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $45.9$. To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$ KAM_{abs} = 45.90 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m} $$",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of $t_{50}$\nThe degradation of aggrecan is described by the first-order kinetic equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = -kA\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables $A$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA}{A} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. Let the integration be from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The corresponding concentrations are from $A(0)=A_0$ to $A(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{A_0}^{A(t)} \\frac{1}{A'} \\, dA' = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(A')]_{A_0}^{A(t)} = [-kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) - \\ln(A_0) = -kt - 0\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{A(t)}{A_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $A(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{A(t)}{A_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem defines $t_{50}$ as the time at which the aggrecan concentration falls to half of its initial value, i.e., $A(t_{50}) = A_0/2$. Substituting this into the solution for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-kt_{50})\n$$\nDividing by $A_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{50})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{50}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{50}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(1/2) = -\\ln(2)$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -kt_{50}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{50}$ gives:\n$$\nt_{50} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nThe constant $k$ is given in units of per hour, so $t_{50}$ will have units of hours.\n\n### Derivation of the Fractional Swelling Ratio $S(t_{50})/S(0)$\nThe problem states two proportionalities:\n1. The osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is proportional to the aggrecan concentration $A$: $\\Pi \\propto A$.\n2. The swelling ratio $S$ is proportional to the osmotic swelling pressure $\\Pi$: $S \\propto \\Pi$.\n\nFrom these two relationships, we can deduce the relationship between the swelling ratio $S$ and the aggrecan concentration $A$. If $S \\propto \\Pi$ and $\\Pi \\propto A$, then by transitivity of proportionality, $S \\propto A$.\nWe can express this relationship with a constant of proportionality, say $c$:\n$$\nS(t) = c A(t)\n$$\nThis constant $c$ is positive and assumed to be constant over the course of the degradation, as the problem states to use the given assumptions only. We are asked to find the fractional swelling ratio $S(t_{50})/S(0)$. Using the proportionality, we can write:\n$$\nS(t_{50}) = c A(t_{50})\n$$\n$$\nS(0) = c A(0)\n$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{S(t_{50})}{S(0)} = \\frac{c A(t_{50})}{c A(0)} = \\frac{A(t_{50})}{A(0)}\n$$\nFrom the initial condition, we have $A(0) = A_0$. By the definition of $t_{50}$, we have $A(t_{50}) = A_0/2$.\nSubstituting these into the ratio expression:\n$$\n\\frac{S(t_{50})}{S(0)} = \\frac{A_0/2}{A_0} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe fractional swelling ratio at time $t_{50}$ relative to the baseline is a dimensionless value of $1/2$.\n\nThe final results are $t_{50} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$ and $\\frac{S(t_{50})}{S(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Differential Equation and Monotonic Properties**\n\nBased on the problem description, the time rate of change of the matrix mass, `dM/dt`, is given by the difference between the anabolic synthesis flux, `A(L)`, and the catabolic degradation flux, `C(L,I)`. This is written as the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = A(L) - C(L,I)\n$$\nThe problem states that \"Mechanical loading within physiologic ranges enhances chondrocyte anabolic activity,\" which implies that the anabolic flux `A` is an increasing function of the load `L`. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial L} > 0\n$$\nThe problem also states that \"excessive loading and inflammation increase catabolic processes,\" which implies that the catabolic flux `C` is an increasing function of both load `L` and inflammation `I`.

Applying this to our differential equation:\n$$\nA(L) - C(L,I) = 0 \\implies A(L) = C(L,I)\n$$\nSubstituting the given functional forms for `A(L)` and `C(L,I)`:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(1 + \\gamma L) = \\delta L + \\eta I\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for `L`. To solve for `L`, we will manipulate the equation into a form that can be solved using the Lambert W function. The Lambert W function, denoted `W(z)`, is defined as the function that satisfies the equation `W(z) \\exp(W(z)) = z`.\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to isolate terms involving `L`:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(1 + \\gamma L) - \\delta L = \\eta I\n$$\nTo make the argument of the logarithm and the other `L` term structurally similar, we can rewrite `\\delta L` as a function of `(1 + \\gamma L)`:\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(1 + \\gamma L) - \\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}(\\gamma L) = \\eta I\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(1 + \\gamma L) - \\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}(1 + \\gamma L - 1) = \\eta I\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha \\ln(1 + \\gamma L) - \\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma}(1 + \\gamma L) + \\frac{\\delta}{\\gamma} = \\eta I\n$$\nLet `v = 1 + \\gamma L`.

Let $u = -\\frac{\\delta}{\\alpha\\gamma} v$. Then $v = -\\frac{\\alpha\\gamma}{\\delta} u$.
