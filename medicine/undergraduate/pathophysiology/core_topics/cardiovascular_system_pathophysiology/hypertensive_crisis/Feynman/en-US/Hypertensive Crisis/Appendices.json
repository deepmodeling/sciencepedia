            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of fluid dynamics and cardiovascular physiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, we derive the relationship between Systemic Vascular Resistance ($SVR$) and the arteriolar radius ($r$). Second, we use this relationship to calculate the fractional reduction in radius required to produce the specified change in Mean Arterial Pressure ($MAP$).\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the SVR-Radius Relationship**\n\nThe problem provides the fundamental relationship between volumetric flow rate ($Q$), pressure drop ($\\Delta P$), and resistance ($R$) as $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$. For the systemic circulation, the total flow is the cardiac output ($CO$), and the overall pressure drop is the difference between the mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) and the central venous pressure ($CVP$). The total resistance is the Systemic Vascular Resistance ($SVR$). Thus, we have:\n$$CO = \\frac{MAP - CVP}{SVR}$$\nThe problem states that $CVP$ is negligible, so we can set $CVP \\approx 0$. This leads to the given approximation:\n$$CO = \\frac{MAP}{SVR} \\quad \\implies \\quad MAP = CO \\cdot SVR$$\nThe resistance of a single, cylindrical arteriole is described by the Poiseuille relation:\n$$R_{\\text{art}} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of blood, $L$ is the length of the arteriole, and $r$ is its internal radius.\n\nThe systemic arteriolar network, which is the primary determinant of $SVR$, consists of a vast number of arterioles arranged in parallel. If we model this network as being composed of $N$ identical arterioles, the total resistance $SVR$ is related to the resistance of a single arteriole, $R_{\\text{art}}$, by the formula for parallel resistors:\n$$\\frac{1}{SVR} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{art},i}}$$\nSince the constriction is uniform, all arterioles are identical, meaning $R_{\\text{art},i} = R_{\\text{art}}$ for all $i$. The sum simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{SVR} = \\frac{N}{R_{\\text{art}}}$$\nSolving for $SVR$ gives:\n$$SVR = \\frac{R_{\\text{art}}}{N}$$\nSubstituting the Poiseuille relation for $R_{\\text{art}}$:\n$$SVR = \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4} \\right)$$\nThe problem states that $\\eta$, $L$, and implicitly the number of arterioles $N$, are constant. We can therefore consolidate all constant terms into a single parameter $k = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{N \\pi}$. The relationship between $SVR$ and arteriolar radius $r$ is then:\n$$SVR(r) = \\frac{k}{r^4}$$\nThis demonstrates that Systemic Vascular Resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the arteriolar radius.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Fractional Reduction in Radius**\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final (hypertensive) state by subscript $2$. We are given:\n- Initial $MAP_1 = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Final $MAP_2 = 160 \\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Cardiac output is constant: $CO_1 = CO_2 = CO$\n\nUsing the relation $MAP = CO \\cdot SVR$ for both states:\n$$MAP_1 = CO \\cdot SVR_1$$\n$$MAP_2 = CO \\cdot SVR_2$$\nDividing the second equation by the first eliminates the constant $CO$:\n$$\\frac{MAP_2}{MAP_1} = \\frac{SVR_2}{SVR_1}$$\nNow, we substitute the dependence of $SVR$ on radius $r$ into this ratio. Let $r_1$ be the initial radius and $r_2$ be the final, constricted radius.\n$$\\frac{SVR_2}{SVR_1} = \\frac{k/r_2^4}{k/r_1^4} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_2^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^4$$\nEquating the two expressions for the ratio gives:\n$$\\frac{MAP_2}{MAP_1} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2}\\right)^4$$\nWe are asked to find the fractional reduction in radius, which is defined as $\\frac{r_1 - r_2}{r_1} = 1 - \\frac{r_2}{r_1}$. To find this, we must first solve for the ratio $\\frac{r_2}{r_1}$. Rearranging the equation above:\n$$\\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4 = \\frac{MAP_1}{MAP_2}$$\n$$\\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\left(\\frac{MAP_1}{MAP_2}\\right)^{1/4}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values for $MAP_1$ and $MAP_2$:\n$$\\frac{r_2}{r_1} = \\left(\\frac{100}{160}\\right)^{1/4} = \\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right)^{1/4} = (0.625)^{1/4}$$\nCalculating the value of the ratio:\n$$\\frac{r_2}{r_1} \\approx 0.889166$$\nFinally, the fractional reduction in radius is:\n$$\\text{Fractional Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{r_2}{r_1} \\approx 1 - 0.889166 = 0.110834$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $0.111$.",

            "problem": "A patient presents in hypertensive crisis with systolic blood pressure (SBP) of $220$ mmHg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of $140$ mmHg. In the acute management of hypertensive emergency, a standard initial goal is to reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) by no more than $25\\%$ in the first hour to avoid organ hypoperfusion. Use the following well-tested facts and definitions from cardiovascular physiology as the foundational base for your derivation: (i) Mean arterial pressure (MAP) approximates organ perfusion pressure and, for clinical purposes at normal heart rates, is given by $MAP = DBP + \\frac{1}{3}(SBP - DBP)$, equivalently $MAP = \\frac{SBP + 2\\,DBP}{3}$; (ii) Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is maintained over a range of perfusion pressures by cerebral autoregulation, but rapid excessive reductions in MAP can precipitate cerebral hypoperfusion.\n\nAssume that, over the first hour, the antihypertensive intervention produces a uniform fractional reduction in both systolic and diastolic pressures so that $SBP$ and $DBP$ each scale by the same factor $k$ with $0 < k < 1$.

An explanation for the risk of exceeding the $25\\%$ reduction guideline.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on established principles of cardiovascular pathophysiology. The presented blood pressure values are characteristic of a hypertensive emergency. The formula for MAP is a standard clinical approximation. The guideline to limit initial MAP reduction to $25\\%$ is a cornerstone of acute hypertensive management to prevent iatrogenic organ hypoperfusion. The concept of cerebral autoregulation and its rightward shift in chronic hypertension is a well-documented physiological phenomenon.

The question is unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, clinical language, free of subjective claims.\n- **Consistency and Completeness:** The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The two provided forms for the MAP formula are algebraically identical.\n- **Realism:** The uniform scaling assumption ($SBP_{new} = k \\cdot SBP_{old}$, $DBP_{new} = k \\cdot DBP_{old}$) is a mathematical simplification, as different antihypertensive agents can have differential effects on systolic and diastolic pressures. However, as an explicit assumption for a modeling problem, it is acceptable and allows for a unique, well-defined solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a three-part calculation followed by a pathophysiological explanation.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Initial MAP**\nThe initial mean arterial pressure, denoted as $MAP_0$, is calculated using the presenting blood pressures and the given formula.\nGiven: $SBP_0 = 220$ and $DBP_0 = 140$.\nThe formula for MAP is:\n$$MAP_0 = \\frac{SBP_0 + 2 \\cdot DBP_0}{3}$$\nSubstituting the initial values:\n$$MAP_0 = \\frac{220 + 2 \\cdot 140}{3} = \\frac{220 + 280}{3} = \\frac{500}{3}$$\nSo, the initial MAP is $\\frac{500}{3}$ mmHg, which is approximately $166.67$ mmHg.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Target MAP**\nThe clinical goal is to reduce the MAP by a maximum of $25\\%$. The target MAP, $MAP_{\\text{target}}$, is therefore $100\\% - 25\\% = 75\\%$ of the initial MAP.\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = (1 - 0.25) \\cdot MAP_0 = 0.75 \\cdot MAP_0$$\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{500}{4} = 125$$\nThe strict upper-limit target MAP is $125$ mmHg.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Target SBP and DBP**\nThe problem states the assumption that both SBP and DBP are reduced by the same scaling factor $k$.\n$$SBP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot SBP_0$$\n$$DBP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot DBP_0$$\nWe can express the $MAP_{\\text{target}}$ using these scaled pressures:\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{SBP_{\\text{target}} + 2 \\cdot DBP_{\\text{target}}}{3}$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $k$:\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{(k \\cdot SBP_0) + 2 \\cdot (k \\cdot DBP_0)}{3}$$\nFactoring out $k$:\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot \\left(\\frac{SBP_0 + 2 \\cdot DBP_0}{3}\\right)$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the definition of the initial MAP, $MAP_0$. Therefore:\n$$MAP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot MAP_0$$\nFrom Part 2, we know that $MAP_{\\text{target}} = 0.75 \\cdot MAP_0$. This directly implies that the scaling factor $k = 0.75$ or $k=\\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nNow, we can compute the absolute target SBP and DBP values.\n$$SBP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot SBP_0 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 220 = 3 \\cdot 55 = 165$$\n$$DBP_{\\text{target}} = k \\cdot DBP_0 = \\frac{3}{4} \\cdot 140 = 3 \\cdot 35 = 105$$\nThe target pressures that achieve the desired MAP reduction under the uniform scaling assumption are $SBP_{\\text{target}} = 165$ mmHg and $DBP_{\\text{target}} = 105$ mmHg.\n\nThe final numerical answer vector $(MAP_{\\text{target}}, SBP_{\\text{target}}, DBP_{\\text{target}})$ is $(125, 165, 105)$.\n\n**Pathophysiological Explanation**\nExceeding a $25\\%$ reduction in MAP in the first hour of treatment for a hypertensive emergency substantially increases the risk of cerebral hypoperfusion due to the adaptive physiology of cerebral autoregulation in chronic hypertension.\n\nCerebral autoregulation is the intrinsic ability of the brain to maintain a constant cerebral blood flow (CBF) despite changes in systemic blood pressure (or cerebral perfusion pressure, which is closely approximated by MAP). In a normotensive individual, this autoregulatory plateau typically spans a MAP range from approximately $60$ mmHg to $150$ mmHg. Within this range, cerebral arterioles dilate in response to falling pressure and constrict in response to rising pressure, thus keeping CBF stable.\n\nIn a patient with chronic hypertension, the cerebral vasculature adapts to the persistently elevated pressures. This adaptation involves structural remodeling of the arterioles, causing the entire autoregulatory curve to shift to the right. Consequently, the lower limit of autoregulation is elevated. For example, a chronically hypertensive patient's brain might only be able to maintain constant CBF for a MAP range of $110$ mmHg to $180$ mmHg.\n\nWhen such a patient presents in hypertensive crisis (e.g., $MAP = 167$ mmHg), their MAP is on the upper end of their shifted autoregulatory curve. If antihypertensive therapy causes a rapid and excessive drop in MAP (e.g., a $40\\%$ reduction, bringing MAP down to $\\approx 100$ mmHg), the pressure may fall below the lower limit of their adapted autoregulatory range. Once below this threshold, the cerebral arterioles are already maximally dilated and cannot compensate further. CBF then becomes passively dependent on pressure, leading to a precipitous decline in blood flow to the brain. This state of hypoperfusion can cause cerebral ischemia and infarction (an ischemic stroke), a severe iatrogenic complication. The empirically derived guideline to limit the initial MAP reduction to $25\\%$ is a safety measure designed to lower the pressure out of the immediate danger zone of hypertensive end-organ damage without overshooting and dropping below the patient's presumed elevated autoregulatory threshold.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in established cardiovascular mechanics principles, and provides a complete set of physiologically plausible parameters. All terms are clearly defined or are standard in the field. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be determined.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts: first, a derivation of the interaction between the ventricle and the arterial system, and second, a calculation of the change in stroke volume under the specified conditions.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Ventricular-Arterial Interaction**\n\nThe problem models the left ventricle using the time-varying elastance concept, given by the equation:\n$$P(t) = E(t)\\,[V(t) - V_0]$$\nwhere $P(t)$ is the instantaneous ventricular pressure, $V(t)$ is the instantaneous ventricular volume, $E(t)$ is the time-varying ventricular elastance, and $V_0$ is the volume-axis intercept of the end-systolic pressure-volume relationship.\n\nAt end-systole, the elastance reaches its maximum value, $E(t) = E_{\\mathrm{es}}$. The pressure and volume at this point are the end-systolic pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{es}}$, and end-systolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{es}}$. The relationship between them is called the End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR). This relationship represents the contractile state of the ventricle and is a line in the pressure-volume (P-V) plane:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{es}} = E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{es}} - V_0)$$\nThe problem states that $E_{\\mathrm{es}}$ and $V_0$ are constant during the hypertensive crisis, so the ESPVR line remains unchanged.\n\nThe arterial system, or afterload, is represented by the effective arterial elastance, $E_a$. As required, we define this quantity first. $E_a$ is defined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure to the stroke volume ($SV$). In this simplified model, it is assumed that the arterial pressure at the start of ejection (diastolic pressure) is negligible compared to the end-systolic pressure.\n$$E_a = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{es}}}{SV}$$\nStroke volume is the volume of blood ejected from the ventricle, which is the difference between the volume at the start of ejection (end-diastolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{ed}}$) and the volume at the end of ejection (end-systolic volume, $V_{\\mathrm{es}}$).\n$$SV = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $SV$ into the definition of $E_a$ gives:\n$$E_a = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{es}}}{V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}}}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the \"arterial load line,\" which describes the properties of the afterload in the P-V diagram:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{es}} = E_a(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}})$$\nThis equation can be written as $P_{\\mathrm{es}} = -E_a V_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a V_{\\mathrm{ed}}$. It describes a line in the P-V plane with a slope of $-E_a$ and a volume-axis intercept at $V_{\\mathrm{ed}}$.\n\nThe operating point of the coupled ventricular-arterial system at end-systole is determined by the intersection of the ESPVR and the arterial load line. At this intersection, the pressure $P_{\\mathrm{es}}$ is the same for both the ventricle and the arterial system. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $P_{\\mathrm{es}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{es}} - V_0) = E_a(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}})$$\nAn increase in arterial elastance from $E_a^{\\mathrm{base}}$ to $E_a^{\\mathrm{crisis}}$ (as occurs in a hypertensive crisis) alters the arterial load line. The ESPVR line, which solely depends on ventricular properties ($E_{\\mathrm{es}}$ and $V_0$), remains fixed. The arterial load line, $P_{\\mathrm{es}} = -E_a V_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a V_{\\mathrm{ed}}$, pivots around the point $(V_{\\mathrm{ed}}, 0)$ on the volume axis. An increase in $E_a$ makes its slope, $-E_a$, more negative (steeper). Consequently, the intersection of the steeper arterial load line with the fixed ESPVR line occurs at a higher end-systolic pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{es}}$) and a larger end-systolic volume ($V_{\\mathrm{es}}$). Since stroke volume is $SV = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}}$, an increase in $V_{\\mathrm{es}}$ (with $V_{\\mathrm{ed}}$ constant) leads to a decrease in stroke volume.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Stroke Volume Reduction**\n\nTo quantify the reduction in stroke volume, we first derive a general expression for $SV$. Starting from the intersection equation:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{es}} - V_0) = E_a(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}})$$\nWe solve for $V_{\\mathrm{es}}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_{\\mathrm{es}} - E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0 = E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} - E_aV_{\\mathrm{es}}$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{es}}(E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a) = E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{es}} = \\frac{E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a}$$\nNow, we find the stroke volume, $SV = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_{\\mathrm{es}}$:\n$$SV = V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - \\frac{E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}(E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a) - (E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} + E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0)}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a}$$\n$$SV = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{ed}}E_{\\mathrm{es}} + V_{\\mathrm{ed}}E_a - E_aV_{\\mathrm{ed}} - E_{\\mathrm{es}}V_0}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_0)}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a}$$\nWe use this final expression for $SV$ with the provided parameters:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{ed}} = 120$ mL\n- $V_0 = 10$ mL\n- $E_{\\mathrm{es}} = 2.0$ mmHg/mL\n- $E_a^{\\mathrm{base}} = 1.5$ mmHg/mL\n- $E_a^{\\mathrm{crisis}} = 3.0$ mmHg/mL\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline stroke volume, $SV_{\\mathrm{base}}$:\n$$SV_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_0)}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a^{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\, (120 - 10)}{2.0 + 1.5} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 110}{3.5} = \\frac{220}{3.5} = \\frac{440}{7} \\text{ mL}$$\nNext, we calculate the stroke volume during the crisis, $SV_{\\mathrm{crisis}}$:\n$$SV_{\\mathrm{crisis}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{es}}(V_{\\mathrm{ed}} - V_0)}{E_{\\mathrm{es}} + E_a^{\\mathrm{crisis}}} = \\frac{2.0 \\, (120 - 10)}{2.0 + 3.0} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 110}{5.0} = \\frac{220}{5} = 44 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe reduction in stroke volume, $\\Delta SV$, is the difference between the baseline and crisis values:\n$$\\Delta SV = SV_{\\mathrm{base}} - SV_{\\mathrm{crisis}} = \\frac{440}{7} - 44 = \\frac{440 - 44 \\times 7}{7} = \\frac{440 - 308}{7} = \\frac{132}{7} \\text{ mL}$$\nTo provide the numerical answer rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\Delta SV = \\frac{132}{7} \\approx 18.85714... \\text{ mL}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $18.86$ mL.",
