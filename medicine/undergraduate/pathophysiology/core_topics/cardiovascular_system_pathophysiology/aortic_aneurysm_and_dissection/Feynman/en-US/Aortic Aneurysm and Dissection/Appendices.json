            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the requested tasks—derivation from first principles and subsequent calculations—are based on established principles of solid mechanics applied to biomechanics. The model of a thin-walled pressurized cylinder is a standard and appropriate approximation for this context, and the given physiological parameters are realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the circumferential (hoop) Cauchy stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, from first principles of static equilibrium. We model a segment of the aorta as a thin-walled cylinder of inner radius $r$, wall thickness $h$, and length $L$. The cylinder is subjected to a uniform internal pressure $P$.\n\nTo find the hoop stress, we imagine cutting the cylinder segment in half along a plane that contains the cylinder's longitudinal axis. We then analyze the equilibrium of one of the halves. The force exerted by the internal pressure must be balanced by the force arising from the stress in the vessel wall.\n\nThe force due to the internal pressure, $F_P$, acts on the projected area of the inner surface. This projected area is a rectangle with dimensions of the inner diameter, $2r$, and the segment length, $L$.\n$$\nF_P = P \\times (\\text{projected area}) = P \\times (2rL)\n$$\nThis force acts to push the two halves of the cylinder apart.\n\nThis outward force is counteracted by the tensile forces within the vessel wall at the two cut sections. The hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is assumed to be uniform across the wall thickness, which is a key assumption of the thin-walled approximation. The cross-sectional area of the wall on which this stress acts is the sum of the areas of the two rectangular sections of the wall created by the cut. Each section has an area of $h \\times L$.\n$$\nF_{\\sigma} = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (\\text{wall cross-sectional area}) = \\sigma_{\\theta} \\times (2hL)\n$$\n\nFor the cylinder to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$\nF_P = F_{\\sigma}\n$$\n$$\nP(2rL) = \\sigma_{\\theta}(2hL)\n$$\nThe terms $2$ and $L$ cancel from both sides, yielding the relationship:\n$$\nPr = \\sigma_{\\theta}h\n$$\nSolving for the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, gives the desired expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{h}\n$$\nThis is the Laplace-Young law for a thin-walled cylinder, derived from first principles.\n\nThe second task is to compute the baseline circumferential wall stress.

The new radius, $r_{\\text{new}}$, is:\n$$\nr_{\\text{new}} = r \\times (1 + 0.25) = 1.25r = 1.25 \\times (0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe pressure $P$ and thickness $h$ remain unchanged. We calculate the new stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{Pr_{\\text{new}}}{h} = \\frac{(15998.64\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.025\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.002\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 199983\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{kPa}$ and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{199983\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{Pa/kPa}} = 199.983\\,\\mathrm{kPa} \\approx 200.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa}\n$$\n\nThe final task is to quantify the multiplicative change in stress. This is the ratio of the new stress to the baseline stress:\n$$\n\\text{Multiplicative change} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{new}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}}\n$$\nWe can compute this ratio using either the symbolic expressions or the numerical values. Using the symbolic expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{new}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{Pr_{\\text{new}}/h}{Pr/h} = \\frac{r_{\\text{new}}}{r}\n$$\nSince $r_{\\text{new}} = 1.25r$, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{1.25r}{r} = 1.25\n$$\nThis is an exact value.

This problem challenges you to compare the mechanical stresses in two different types of aneurysms—fusiform and saccular—by applying principles of thin-walled vessel mechanics and stress concentration.

            "id": "4763932",
            "problem": "Aneurysm rupture risk is governed by the stresses borne by the diseased arterial wall under a given transmural pressure. Consider two idealized morphologies in the thoracic aorta at the same mean arterial transmural pressure $P$: a fusiform aneurysm represented as a thin-walled cylindrical segment of radius $R_f$ and wall thickness $h_f$, and a saccular aneurysm represented as a thin-walled hemispherical dome of radius $R_s$ and wall thickness $h_s$ attached to a non-dilated parent aorta by a relatively sharp neck. Rupture occurs when local circumferential stress equals a material failure threshold. In thin-walled pressure vessels, circumferential stress scales with pressure, radius, and thickness, and geometric discontinuities produce stress concentration factors. In saccular aneurysms, the dome and neck region are often thinner and more heterogeneous than the surrounding wall. Assume the following physiologically plausible values at rest: $P = 13\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, $R_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $h_f = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $R_s = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, $h_s = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, and a dimensionless stress concentration factor at the saccular neck of $K_t = 2.2$. Which of the following statements best explains why, under these conditions and using first principles of thin-walled vessel mechanics and stress concentration, saccular aneurysms may rupture at smaller diameters than fusiform aneurysms?\n\nA. Using thin-walled vessel mechanics, the nominal dome stress in a saccular aneurysm scales as $P R_s / (2 h_s)$, and the local stress near the neck is amplified by $K_t$. Because $h_s$ is smaller and $K_t > 1$, the local circumferential stress can exceed the fusiform hoop stress $P R_f / h_f$ despite $R_s < R_f$, making rupture at smaller diameter plausible.\n\nB. Because spherical shapes distribute stress more evenly, the saccular dome necessarily has lower wall stress than a fusiform aneurysm at the same pressure, so rupture requires larger diameters.\n\nC. Blood pressure within a saccular pouch is higher than in the parent aorta due to flow stagnation, explaining rupture at smaller size independent of wall properties.\n\nD. Wall calcification increases stiffness, which raises wall stress at a given pressure, explaining earlier rupture of saccular aneurysms.\n\nE. The presence of a narrow neck reduces transmission of pressure to the dome, protecting the saccular aneurysm against rupture at small size.",
            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n- **General Condition:** Aneurysm rupture risk is governed by the circumferential stress in the arterial wall. Rupture occurs when this stress reaches a material failure threshold. The analysis is based on thin-walled pressure vessel mechanics and stress concentration.\n- **Transmural Pressure:** $P = 13\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- **Fusiform Aneurysm (Cylindrical Model):**\n    - Radius: $R_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    - Wall thickness: $h_f = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- **Saccular Aneurysm (Hemispherical Model):**\n    - Radius: $R_s = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n    - Wall thickness: $h_s = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- **Stress Concentration:**\n    - A dimensionless stress concentration factor at the saccular neck is given as $K_t = 2.2$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of continuum mechanics, specifically the theory of thin-walled pressure vessels (a direct application of Laplace's Law) and the concept of stress concentration at geometric discontinuities. These are standard and well-established engineering principles routinely applied in biomechanics to model arteries and aneurysms. The provided physiological values ($P \\approx 97.5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, radii in the cm range, wall thickness in the mm range) are clinically realistic for thoracic aortic aneurysms.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for a qualitative explanation supported by a quantitative comparison based on the provided data and principles. The information is sufficient to perform this comparison and arrive at a definitive conclusion regarding the mechanical stresses in the two idealized geometries.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, using standard terminology from mechanics and pathophysiology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Flaw Checklist:**\n    - **Scientific Unsoundness:** None. The physical and mathematical basis is sound.\n    - **Non-Formalizable:** The problem is directly formalizable using standard equations.\n    - **Incomplete/Contradictory:** All necessary data for a first-principles comparison are provided. There are no contradictions.\n    - **Unrealistic/Infeasible:** The parameters are physiologically and mechanically plausible.\n    - **Ill-Posed:** The problem structure leads to a unique and meaningful analysis.\n    - **Trivial/Tautological:** The problem requires the synthesis of multiple concepts (cylindrical vs. spherical stress, stress concentration) and a numerical comparison, which is a non-trivial exercise in applied mechanics.\n    - **Unverifiable:** The conclusion can be directly verified through calculation based on the given principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The analysis may proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION AND SOLUTION\n\nThe central task is to compare the maximum wall stress in the fusiform aneurysm model with the maximum wall stress in the saccular aneurysm model. Rupture is assumed to occur when the local stress exceeds a critical failure threshold. The aneurysm geometry that produces a higher wall stress under the given conditions is at a greater risk of rupture.\n\n**1. Stress in the Fusiform Aneurysm (Cylindrical Model)**\n\nFor a thin-walled cylinder subjected to an internal pressure $P$, the circumferential stress, also known as hoop stress ($\\sigma_f$), is given by the formula:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{P R_f}{h_f} $$\nSubstituting the given values, ensuring consistent units (e.g., meters and Pascals):\n- $P = 13\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 13 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $R_f = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $h_f = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe stress is calculated as:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{(13 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.025\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{325\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}{0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 108333\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 108.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\n\n**2. Stress in the Saccular Aneurysm (Hemispherical Model)**\n\nFor a thin-walled sphere (or hemisphere) subjected to an internal pressure $P$, the membrane stress ($\\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}}$) is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} = \\frac{P R_s}{2 h_s} $$\nThis represents the nominal stress in the dome of the saccular aneurysm, away from the geometric discontinuity at the neck.\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $P = 13 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $R_s = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $h_s = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe nominal dome stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} = \\frac{(13 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (0.015\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2 \\times (0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{195\\,\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}}{0.003\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 65000\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 65.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\n\nHowever, the problem specifies a geometric discontinuity at the neck, which creates a stress concentration. The peak local stress, $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}}$, is found by multiplying the nominal stress by the stress concentration factor, $K_t$.\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = K_t \\times \\sigma_{s, \\text{nominal}} $$\nUsing the given $K_t = 2.2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = 2.2 \\times 65.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa} = 143.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\n\n**3. Comparison and Conclusion**\n\nComparing the maximum stress in each configuration:\n- Maximum stress in fusiform aneurysm: $\\sigma_f = 108.3\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n- Maximum stress in saccular aneurysm: $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} = 143.0\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nThe analysis shows that $\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} > \\sigma_f$. Despite the saccular aneurysm having a smaller radius ($R_s < R_f$), the combination of its relatively thinner wall (the ratio $R_s/h_s = 10$ is greater than $R_f/h_f \\approx 8.33$) and the significant stress concentration at its neck leads to a higher peak stress. Therefore, under these conditions, the saccular aneurysm is at a higher risk of rupture, which explains why rupture can occur at smaller-diameter saccular aneurysms compared to fusiform ones.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Using thin-walled vessel mechanics, the nominal dome stress in a saccular aneurysm scales as $P R_s / (2 h_s)$, and the local stress near the neck is amplified by $K_t$. Because $h_s$ is smaller and $K_t > 1$, the local circumferential stress can exceed the fusiform hoop stress $P R_f / h_f$ despite $R_s < R_f$, making rupture at smaller diameter plausible.**\n- This statement correctly provides the formulae for stress in a sphere ($P R_s / (2 h_s)$) and a cylinder ($P R_f / h_f$).\n- It correctly identifies the role of the stress concentration factor $K_t$ in amplifying the local stress.\n- It provides a sound and complete physical explanation for why the peak stress in the saccular aneurysm can be higher, despite its smaller radius.\n- The conclusion is fully supported by the\nderivation above ($\\sigma_{s, \\text{peak}} \\approx 143\\,\\mathrm{kPa} > \\sigma_f \\approx 108\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$).\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because spherical shapes distribute stress more evenly, the saccular dome necessarily has lower wall stress than a fusiform aneurysm at the same pressure, so rupture requires larger diameters.**\n- While a sphere has lower stress than a cylinder for the *same* $P$, $R$, and $h$, this option incorrectly generalizes this to \"necessarily has lower wall stress\" without considering that $R$ and $h$ are different in the problem.\n- Most critically, it completely ignores the stress concentration at the neck, which is explicitly mentioned in the problem setup and is the location of the peak stress. The conclusion that rupture requires larger diameters is contrary to the result of a complete analysis.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Blood pressure within a saccular pouch is higher than in the parent aorta due to flow stagnation, explaining rupture at smaller size independent of wall properties.**\n- The premise regarding fluid dynamics is flawed in its significance. While stagnation pressure exists (Bernoulli's principle), the increase in pressure due to flow stagnation in the aorta is minuscule compared to the mean arterial pressure. The dynamic pressure, $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2$, is on the order of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$, while the transmural pressure $P$ is $13\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$. This effect is not the primary driver.\n- The claim that this explains rupture \"independent of wall properties\" is fundamentally incorrect. Rupture is a mechanical failure of the wall, which is intrinsically dependent on wall properties like thickness and material strength, which determine the resulting stress.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Wall calcification increases stiffness, which raises wall stress at a given pressure, explaining earlier rupture of saccular aneurysms.**\n- This statement confuses material stiffness (Young's modulus) with stress. For a given pressure and geometry, the equilibrium stress in a thin-walled elastic structure is determined by the balance of forces, not the material's stiffness. The formulae $\\sigma = PR/h$ and $\\sigma = PR/(2h)$ do not contain the elastic modulus.\n- Increased stiffness means the material will deform less (lower strain) for a given stress. While calcification can make the wall more brittle (reducing its failure strain or toughness) and thus increase rupture risk, it does not \"raise wall stress\".\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The presence of a narrow neck reduces transmission of pressure to the dome, protecting the saccular aneurysm against rupture at small size.**\n- This statement violates Pascal's principle. In a fluid at rest or in slow-moving flow, pressure is transmitted nearly undiminished throughout the fluid. The full transmural pressure $P$ acts on the internal surface of the aneurysm dome.\n- Furthermore, the narrow neck and sharp transition are a source of stress concentration, which *increases* stress and rupture risk, the exact opposite of the \"protective\" effect claimed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's Body Surface Area (BSA) using the provided Mosteller formula:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{h \\times w}{3600}}$$\nThe patient's height is given as $h = 150 \\mathrm{ cm}$ and her weight is $w = 52 \\mathrm{ kg}$.

The problem states that the individual hazard ratios are multiplicative. The given hazard ratios are $H_1 = 1.12$ for a first-degree relative with early dissection and $H_2 = 1.03$ for a second-degree relative with an aneurysm.\nThe combined familial hazard ratio is:\n$$H_{\\text{fam}} = H_1 \\times H_2 = 1.12 \\times 1.03 = 1.1536$$\nThis combined hazard ratio is a dimensionless quantity that increases the patient's baseline risk.\n\nThird, we derive and compute the adjusted surgical threshold diameter, $d_{\\text{thr}}$. The problem is framed within a proportional hazards model, where the instantaneous risk, $R$, is proportional to the product of a geometric risk term (the Aortic Size Index, $ASI$) and the multiplicative familial hazard modifiers ($H_{\\text{fam}}$).\n$$R \\propto ASI \\times H_{\\text{fam}}$$\nThe target risk level for intervention is established by the baseline case for Turner syndrome without additional familial risk factors (i.e., $H_{\\text{fam}}=1$).
