            "problem": "A patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) develops asymmetric septal hypertrophy over time. Assume the left ventricle can be approximated as a thin-walled spherical chamber during peak systole, and that the average circumferential wall stress arises from the balance of transmural pressure-generated forces and the resisting tensile forces in the wall. Starting from the thin-wall equilibrium implied by Laplace’s law for a sphere, derive the relationship between wall stress $\\sigma$, intraventricular pressure $P$, chamber radius $r$, and wall thickness $h$.

Express your final answer in $\\text{mmHg}$. Provide the exact value; do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two parts: first, to derive the formula for wall stress in a thin-walled sphere, and second, to calculate the change in wall stress given specific physiological parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Wall Stress Formula (Laplace's Law)**\n\nWe model the left ventricle as a thin-walled sphere of radius $r$ and wall thickness $h$. The chamber is under a uniform internal pressure $P$ relative to the outside (transmural pressure). To find the circumferential stress $\\sigma$ in the wall, we consider the equilibrium of forces acting on one hemisphere.\n\nImagine dividing the sphere into two hemispheres. The force exerted by the internal pressure $P$ pushing the two hemispheres apart is equal to the pressure multiplied by the projected area of the cut, which is a circle of area $\\pi r^2$.\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = P \\cdot A_{\\text{circle}} = P (\\pi r^2)$$\nThis outward force is balanced by the internal tensile force within the material of the wall. This force acts on the cross-sectional area of the wall along the cut. For a thin wall ($h \\ll r$), this cross-sectional area can be approximated as the circumference of the cut multiplied by the wall thickness.\n$$A_{\\text{wall}} \\approx (2\\pi r)h$$\nThe total tensile force in the wall is the product of the average wall stress $\\sigma$ and this cross-sectional area.\n$$F_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma \\cdot A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nFor the sphere to be in equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = F_{\\text{wall}}$$\n$$P (\\pi r^2) = \\sigma (2\\pi r h)$$\nWe can now solve for the wall stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{P (\\pi r^2)}{2\\pi r h}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling common factors ($\\pi$ and $r$) yields the relationship known as Laplace's law for a sphere:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$$\nThis is the required relationship between wall stress $\\sigma$, pressure $P$, radius $r$, and thickness $h$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Wall Stress ($\\Delta \\sigma$)**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Pressure: $P = 120\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n- Radius: $r = 2.5\\,\\text{cm}$\n- Initial thickness: $h_{\\text{initial}} = 1.2\\,\\text{cm}$\n- Final thickness: $h_{\\text{final}} = 1.8\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nThe problem states that $P$ and $r$ remain constant. The change in wall stress, $\\Delta \\sigma$, is defined as the final stress minus the initial stress.\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\sigma_{\\text{final}} - \\sigma_{\\text{initial}}$$\nUsing the derived formula, we can express the initial and final stresses:\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{Pr}{2h_{\\text{initial}}}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{Pr}{2h_{\\text{final}}}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\Delta \\sigma$:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h_{\\text{final}}} - \\frac{Pr}{2h_{\\text{initial}}}$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{Pr}{2}$:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{h_{\\text{final}}} - \\frac{1}{h_{\\text{initial}}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression. Note that since $r$, $h_{\\text{initial}}$, and $h_{\\text{final}}$ are all in units of $\\text{cm}$, these units will cancel, leaving the stress in the same units as the pressure, $\\text{mmHg}$, as required.\n$$P = 120$$\n$$r = 2.5$$\n$$h_{\\text{initial}} = 1.2$$\n$$h_{\\text{final}} = 1.8$$\nFirst, calculate the constant term:\n$$\\frac{Pr}{2} = \\frac{120 \\times 2.5}{2} = \\frac{300}{2} = 150$$\nNext, calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$$\\frac{1}{h_{\\text{final}}} - \\frac{1}{h_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1}{1.8} - \\frac{1}{1.2}$$\nTo subtract these, we find a common denominator. First, express the decimals as fractions: $1.8 = \\frac{18}{10} = \\frac{9}{5}$ and $1.2 = \\frac{12}{10} = \\frac{6}{5}$.\n$$\\frac{1}{9/5} - \\frac{1}{6/5} = \\frac{5}{9} - \\frac{5}{6}$$\nThe least common multiple of $9$ and $6$ is $18$.\n$$\\frac{5 \\cdot 2}{9 \\cdot 2} - \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{6 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{10}{18} - \\frac{15}{18} = -\\frac{5}{18}$$\nFinally, we multiply the two parts to find $\\Delta \\sigma$:\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = 150 \\times \\left( -\\frac{5}{18} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = -\\frac{150 \\times 5}{18} = -\\frac{750}{18}$$\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $6$.\n$$\\Delta \\sigma = -\\frac{750 \\div 6}{18 \\div 6} = -\\frac{125}{3}$$\nThe change in wall stress is $-\\frac{125}{3}\\,\\text{mmHg}$. The negative sign indicates that the wall stress decreases as the wall thickness increases, which is a compensatory mechanism in response to pressure overload.",

            "solution": "The solution proceeds in three parts: derivation of the pressure gradient formula, calculation of the change in gradient, and physiological interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Pressure Gradient Expression**\n\nThe problem asks to start from the Bernoulli principle for steady, incompressible flow. The Bernoulli equation relates pressure ($P$), velocity ($v$), and height ($z$) between two points (point A, proximal to the obstruction, and point B, at the site of the high-velocity jet) along a streamline:\n$$\nP_A + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2 + \\rho g z_A = P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_B^2 + \\rho g z_B\n$$\nHere, $P$ is the static pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $z$ is the vertical height.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement:\n1.  **Negligible differences in height**: The LVOT is oriented nearly horizontally, so we can assume $z_A \\approx z_B$. This allows the potential energy terms, $\\rho g z_A$ and $\\rho g z_B$, to be cancelled from the equation:\n    $$\n    P_A + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2 = P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_B^2\n    $$\n2.  **Negligible proximal velocity**: The velocity in the main chamber of the left ventricle (point A) is much smaller than the jet velocity through the narrow obstruction (point B). Thus, we can approximate the proximal velocity $v_A \\approx 0$. The kinetic energy term $\\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_A^2$ becomes negligible.\n\nLet $v_B$ be the measured peak jet velocity, which we will denote simply as $v$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nP_A \\approx P_B + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2\n$$\nThe pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, across the LVOT is defined as the difference between the proximal pressure (in the left ventricle, $P_A$) and the pressure within the jet (in the LVOT, $P_B$).\n$$\n\\Delta P = P_A - P_B\n$$\nSubstituting the simplified Bernoulli relation, we derive the expression for the pressure gradient in terms of the jet velocity:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2\n$$\nThis is the simplified Bernoulli equation commonly used in echocardiography to estimate pressure gradients from Doppler velocity measurements.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Pressure Gradient**\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in the peak instantaneous LVOT pressure gradient, $\\Delta(\\Delta P)$, due to the Valsalva maneuver.

This rise in pressure impedes venous return to the right atrium, subsequently reducing filling of a non-compliant left ventricle. This reduction in left ventricular preload (end-diastolic volume) is a key factor in the hemodynamics of obstructive HCM. In this condition, the LVOT obstruction is dynamic, caused by the systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve leaflet toward a hypertrophied interventricular septum. A smaller, underfilled left ventricle brings the septum and mitral leaflet into closer proximity, which exacerbates SAM and worsens the functional obstruction. The increased obstruction requires the ventricle to generate a higher pressure to eject blood, leading to a higher velocity jet through the narrowed outflow tract. The calculation confirms this principle: the reduction in preload from the Valsalva maneuver increased the jet velocity from $3.5\\,\\text{m/s}$ to $4.5\\,\\text{m/s}$, resulting in a clinically significant augmentation of the peak pressure gradient by $31.8\\,\\text{mmHg}$. This response is a hallmark of dynamic LVOT obstruction.",
