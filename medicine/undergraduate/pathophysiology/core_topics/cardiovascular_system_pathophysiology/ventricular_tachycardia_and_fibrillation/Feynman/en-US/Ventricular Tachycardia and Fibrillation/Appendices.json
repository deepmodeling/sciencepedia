To convert from Volts to millivolts, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\Delta E_K \\approx 18.5153\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta E_K \\approx 18.52\\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\n\nThe positive sign of $\\Delta E_K$ indicates that the potassium equilibrium potential becomes less negative (i.e., it depolarizes). Based on the problem's assumption that the resting membrane potential (RMP) is dominated by and approximates $E_K$, the RMP will also shift in the positive direction, becoming less negative. For instance, if the initial RMP was approximately $-90\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, the new RMP would be approximately $-90\\ \\mathrm{mV} + 18.52\\ \\mathrm{mV} = -71.48\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThis shift has critical consequences for myocardial cell function:\n1.  **Direction of RMP Shift**: The RMP shifts to a less negative, or more depolarized, potential.\n2.  **Impact on Excitability**: The RMP is now closer to the threshold potential required to trigger an action potential. Initially, this proximity means that a smaller stimulus is needed to depolarize the cell to threshold, thus increasing myocyte excitability. This can lead to ectopic beats and re-entrant arrhythmias like ventricular tachycardia.\n3.  **Impact on Conduction**: The persistent depolarization has a second, crucial effect: it leads to the steady-state inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels ($Na_v$). A fraction of these channels enters an inactivated state from which they cannot be opened by a subsequent depolarization. With fewer available $Na_v$ channels, the upstroke velocity (phase $0$) of the action potential decreases significantly. According to cable theory, conduction velocity is proportional to the rate of rise of the action potential. Therefore, a slower upstroke leads to a slowing of conduction velocity. In severe hyperkalemia, profound $Na_v$ channel inactivation can render the myocardium inexcitable, leading to conduction block and asystole. This slowing of conduction is a key mechanism by which hyperkalemia promotes re-entrant circuits, which can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation.\n\nIn summary, the rise in extracellular potassium depolarizes the resting membrane potential, which has a dual effect of initially increasing excitability while simultaneously slowing conduction and potentially leading to a loss of excitability. Both effects are highly arrhythmogenic.",

By biophysical definition, the wavelength $\\lambda$ of the propagating activation is the spatial distance covered by the wavefront during the time the tissue is effectively refractory. Reentry is favored when the circuit path length exceeds this wavelength, so one can quantify reentry propensity by comparing the circuit path length to the wavelength.\n\nConsider a scar-related ventricular substrate with baseline conduction velocity $50\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$ and baseline effective refractory period $220\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.

The concepts presented—reentrant circuits, path length ($P$), conduction velocity ($CV$), effective refractory period ($ERP$), and their relationship in the form of the wavelength ($\\lambda = CV \\times ERP$)—are standard models for understanding arrhythmia mechanisms. The premise that reentry is sustained when the path length exceeds the wavelength ($P > \\lambda$) corresponds to the well-established concept of an \"excitable gap.\" The specified effects of a Class I sodium channel blocker, particularly the reduction in conduction velocity, are biophysically correct. The concurrent shortening of the ERP is characteristic of Class Ib agents, which is a plausible scenario in the context of scar-related myocardium. The numerical values for $CV$, $ERP$, and $P$ are within physiologically realistic ranges for human ventricular tissue.

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the new wavelength, $\\lambda_{new}$, and the new reentry index, $R_{new}$, after the administration of a sodium channel blocking agent.\n\nLet the baseline parameters be denoted with a subscript $0$.\nThe baseline conduction velocity is $CV_0 = 50\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$.\nThe baseline effective refractory period is $ERP_0 = 220\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nThe drug reduces the conduction velocity by $30\\%$. The new conduction velocity, $CV_{new}$, is therefore:\n$$CV_{new} = CV_0 \\times (1 - 0.30) = 0.70 \\times CV_0$$\n\nThe drug shortens the effective refractory period by $20\\%$. The new effective refractory period, $ERP_{new}$, is:\n$$ERP_{new} = ERP_0 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 \\times ERP_0$$\n\nThe wavelength, $\\lambda$, is defined as the product of conduction velocity and the effective refractory period:\n$$\\lambda = CV \\times ERP$$\n\nThe new wavelength, $\\lambda_{new}$, is calculated using the new parameters:\n$$\\lambda_{new} = CV_{new} \\times ERP_{new}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $CV_{new}$ and $ERP_{new}$:\n$$\\lambda_{new} = (0.70 \\times CV_0) \\times (0.80 \\times ERP_0)$$\n\nBefore substituting numerical values, we must ensure consistent units.

We denote the diastolic interval preceding the $n$-th beat as $DI_n$ and the action potential duration of the $n$-th beat as $APD_n$.\n\nThe restitution function gives the dependence of $APD_n$ on the preceding rest time, $DI_n$:\n$$APD_n = APD(DI_n) = 200 - 80\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI_n}{50}\\right)$$\nThe timing identity, under constant pacing with cycle length $CL$, relates the duration of one beat ($APD_n$) to the next diastolic interval ($DI_{n+1}$). The total time from the start of beat $n$ to the start of beat $n+1$ is $CL$:\n$$CL = APD_n + DI_{n+1}$$\nThis is the standard interpretation in cardiac dynamics, ensuring conservation of time over a cycle.\n\nFrom the timing identity, we can express $DI_{n+1}$ in terms of $APD_n$:\n$$DI_{n+1} = CL - APD_n$$\nSubstituting the restitution function for $APD_n$ yields the one-dimensional return map for the diastolic interval, $DI_{n+1} = F(DI_n)$:\n$$DI_{n+1} = CL - \\left(200 - 80\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI_n}{50}\\right)\\right)$$\nGiven the pacing cycle length $CL = 260$ ms, the specific return map is:\n$$DI_{n+1} = F(DI_n) = 260 - 200 + 80\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI_n}{50}\\right) = 60 + 80\\exp\\left(-\\frac{DI_n}{50}\\right)$$\nAt a steady state, the diastolic interval is constant from beat to beat, so $DI_{n+1} = DI_n = DI^{\\ast}$.

The condition for stability is $|s^{\\ast}| < 1$. Here, $|s^{\\ast}| \\approx 0.3422 < 1$, so the steady state is stable. In this regime, the system converges to a period-$1$ rhythm (constant $DI$ and $APD$ every beat) and evolves away from APD alternans. The onset of alternans occurs via a period-doubling bifurcation when $s^{\\ast}$ crosses $-1$, or $|s^{\\ast}|$ becomes greater than $1$. Since $|s^{\\ast}| < 1$, the system is not susceptible to alternans.\n\nThe final answers for the two parts, rounded to $4$ significant figures, are $APD_{100} = 189.2$ and the magnitude $s^{\\ast} = 0.3422$.",
