Its application to model the left ventricle is a standard, albeit simplified, approach in cardiovascular physiology and biomechanics to explain the concept of wall stress and the mechanisms of cardiac remodeling (e.g., hypertrophy). The physiological values provided are plausible for a human heart. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It requests a derivation, a calculation based on given parameters, and a subsequent calculation based on a defined change. The objectives are clear and lead to a unique, stable solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, precise, and objective language without subjective or opinion-based claims.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary data and conditions for a solution. The only point of consideration is the \"thin-walled\" approximation. For a structure to be considered thin-walled, the ratio of radius to thickness ($r/h$) should typically be greater than or equal to $10$. In this problem, $r/h = 3.0/1.0 = 3$. This indicates that the thin-wall assumption is a significant simplification, as the actual LV is a thick-walled structure. However, the problem explicitly states to use this model. This is a common pedagogical choice to introduce the fundamental relationship between pressure, radius, and stress before progressing to more complex thick-walled models (e.g., Lame's equations). Therefore, this is a stated premise of the simplified model, not a flaw that invalidates the problem itself.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Justification\n\n**Derivation of Circumferential Wall Stress ($\\sigma$)**\n\nWe model the left ventricle as a thin-walled sphere of radius $r$ and wall thickness $h$. The chamber is subjected to a uniform transmural pressure $P$. To find the circumferential stress $\\sigma$ in the wall, we consider the mechanical equilibrium of a hemisphere, which is obtained by conceptually bisecting the sphere.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure, $F_P$, acts on the circular cross-sectional area created by the bisection. This area is $A_P = \\pi r^2$. The force is therefore:\n$$\nF_P = P \\cdot A_P = P \\pi r^2\n$$\nThis outward-directed force must be balanced by the internal tensile force within the material of the wall, $F_W$. This force is the product of the circumferential stress, $\\sigma$, and the cross-sectional area of the wall material along the cut. For a thin-walled sphere (where $h \\ll r$), this area, $A_W$, can be approximated as the circumference of the sphere multiplied by the wall thickness:\n$$\nA_W \\approx (2 \\pi r) h\n$$\nThe total tensile force in the wall is thus:\n$$\nF_W = \\sigma \\cdot A_W = \\sigma (2 \\pi r h)\n$$\nFor the hemisphere to be in static equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$\nF_P = F_W\n$$\n$$\nP \\pi r^2 = \\sigma (2 \\pi r h)\n$$\nSolving for the circumferential wall stress, $\\sigma$, we divide both sides by $2 \\pi r h$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{P \\pi r^2}{2 \\pi r h} = \\frac{Pr}{2h}\n$$\nThis expression is the Law of Laplace for a spherical pressure vessel.\n\n**Justification of the Model in Pathophysiology**\n\nThis relationship is fundamental to understanding cardiac remodeling. Wall stress ($\\sigma$) is a primary determinant of myocardial oxygen demand and a critical signal for cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling. In pathological states such as chronic hypertension (pressure overload) or aortic regurgitation (volume overload), the heart attempts to normalize wall stress to maintain function.\n-   In response to increased pressure ($P$), the ventricle hypertrophies by increasing wall thickness ($h$), a process known as concentric hypertrophy. According to the formula $\\sigma = Pr/(2h)$, increasing $h$ reduces $\\sigma$ back towards a normal level.\n-   In response to increased volume, which leads to an increased radius ($r$), the ventricle hypertrophies by increasing its mass to maintain a proportionate wall thickness, a process known as eccentric hypertrophy.\nAlthough a simple sphere is a crude approximation of the LV's complex prolate ellipsoid geometry and anisotropic, fibrous tissue, the Laplace relationship effectively captures the core mechanical principle governing the adaptive (or maladaptive) structural changes seen in cardiovascular disease. The use of a thin-wall model, despite the LV being a thick-walled structure ($r/h \\approx 3$ in this problem), is a valid starting point for illustrating this principle clearly.\n\n### Numerical Calculations\n\n**1. Initial Wall Stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{initial}}$)**\n\nFirst, we convert the units to be consistent. The stress is required in kilopascals (kPa). The formula $\\sigma = \\frac{Pr}{2h}$ shows that if $r$ and $h$ are in the same units (e.g., cm), they cancel, and the unit of $\\sigma$ will be the same as the unit of $P$.\nGiven $P = 120$ mmHg. We convert this to kPa:\n$$\nP = 120 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{0.133322 \\text{ kPa}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 15.99864 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nThe initial parameters are $P = 15.99864$ kPa, $r = 3.0$ cm, and $h = h_{\\text{initial}} = 1.0$ cm.\nUsing the derived formula for stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{P r}{2 h_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{(15.99864 \\text{ kPa}) (3.0 \\text{ cm})}{2 (1.0 \\text{ cm})} = \\frac{47.99592}{2} \\text{ kPa} = 23.99796 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{initial}} = 24.00 \\text{ kPa}\n$$\n\n**2. New Wall Thickness ($h_{\\text{new}}$)**\n\nThe goal is to find the new wall thickness, $h_{\\text{new}}$, that reduces the wall stress by $20\\%$. The new stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$, is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\sigma_{\\text{initial}} \\times (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 \\times \\sigma_{\\text{initial}}\n$$\nThe pressure $P$ and radius $r$ are stated to remain constant. The new stress is related to the new thickness by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{P r}{2 h_{\\text{new}}}\n$$\nWe can establish a ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{new}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{Pr/(2h_{\\text{new}})}{Pr/(2h_{\\text{initial}})} = \\frac{h_{\\text{initial}}}{h_{\\text{new}}}\n$$\nWe know that $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{new}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{initial}}} = 0.80$. Therefore:\n$$\n0.80 = \\frac{h_{\\text{initial}}}{h_{\\text{new}}}\n$$\nSolving for $h_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nh_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{h_{\\text{initial}}}{0.80} = \\frac{1.0 \\text{ cm}}{0.80} = 1.25 \\text{ cm}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$\nh_{\\text{new}} = 1.250 \\text{ cm}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the principle of concentric hypertrophy: to counteract a given pressure load and reduce wall stress, the ventricular wall must thicken.",
