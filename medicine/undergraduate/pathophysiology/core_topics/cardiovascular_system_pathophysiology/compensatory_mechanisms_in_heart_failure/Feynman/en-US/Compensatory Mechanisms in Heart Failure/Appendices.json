This practice delves into the Guytonian model of circulation to quantify how neurohormonal venoconstriction accomplishes this.

            "problem": "A patient with acute decompensated heart failure exhibits neurohumoral venoconstriction that shifts a fraction of venous blood from unstressed to stressed volume. In the Guytonian framework, mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP, denoted $P_{msf}$) is the pressure throughout the systemic circulation when cardiac output is zero, and venous return depends on the pressure gradient driving flow from the systemic veins to the right atrium. Use the following physiologic assumptions as the fundamental base:\n\n- Venous compliance $C_v$ is defined by the relation between a small change in stressed volume and the accompanying change in venous pressure: $C_v = \\Delta V / \\Delta P$, where, for the systemic veins under steady-state conditions, $\\Delta P$ equals $\\Delta P_{msf}$.\n- Venous return is linearly related to the pressure gradient between the mean systemic filling pressure and right atrial pressure (RA), with proportionality given by the inverse of an effective resistance to venous return $R_{vr}$.\n\nSuppose the total systemic venous blood volume is $3000$ mL, and a compensatory venoconstrictive response shifts $10$ percent of this venous blood from unstressed to stressed volume. The venous compliance is $C_v = 100$ mL/mmHg. Right atrial pressure $P_{ra}$ is held constant at $4$ mmHg by mechanical support, and the effective resistance to venous return is $R_{vr} = 1.5$ mmHg/(L/min).\n\nStarting from the above definitions, first compute the change in mean systemic filling pressure $\\Delta P_{msf}$ induced by the shift in stressed volume. Then, assuming $P_{ra}$ remains fixed, predict the change in venous return $\\Delta VR$ produced by this $\\Delta P_{msf}$. Round your answers to three significant figures. Express the change in mean systemic filling pressure in mmHg and the change in venous return in L/min. Report your final two values as a row matrix in the order: change in mean systemic filling pressure (mmHg), change in venous return (L/min).",
            "solution": "First, we calculate the change in mean systemic filling pressure, $\\Delta P_{msf}$.\nThe total systemic venous blood volume is given as $V_{total, venous} = 3000 \\text{ mL}$.\nA venoconstrictive response shifts a fraction, $f = 10\\% = 0.10$, of this volume from the unstressed pool to the stressed pool. The stressed volume is the volume that exerts pressure on the walls of the vasculature. Therefore, the change in stressed volume, $\\Delta V_{stressed}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{stressed} = f \\times V_{total, venous} = 0.10 \\times 3000 \\text{ mL} = 300 \\text{ mL}\n$$\nThe problem defines venous compliance, $C_v$, as the ratio of the change in volume to the change in pressure, $C_v = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P}$. It is specified that for the systemic circulation, this change in volume corresponds to the change in stressed volume, and the change in pressure is the change in mean systemic filling pressure, $\\Delta P_{msf}$. Thus, the relationship is:\n$$\nC_v = \\frac{\\Delta V_{stressed}}{\\Delta P_{msf}}\n$$\nWe are given $C_v = 100 \\text{ mL/mmHg}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $\\Delta P_{msf}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{msf} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{stressed}}{C_v}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{msf} = \\frac{300 \\text{ mL}}{100 \\text{ mL/mmHg}} = 3 \\text{ mmHg}\n$$\n\nSecond, we compute the consequent change in venous return, $\\Delta VR$.\nVenous return, $VR$, is given by the formula:\n$$\nVR = \\frac{P_{msf} - P_{ra}}{R_{vr}}\n$$\nWe seek the change in venous return, $\\Delta VR$, resulting from the change in mean systemic filling pressure, $\\Delta P_{msf}$. Since the right atrial pressure, $P_{ra}$, and the resistance to venous return, $R_{vr}$, are held constant, the change in venous return simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta VR = \\frac{\\Delta P_{msf}}{R_{vr}}\n$$\nWe substitute the calculated value for $\\Delta P_{msf}$ and the given value for $R_{vr}$:\n$\\Delta P_{msf} = 3 \\text{ mmHg}$ and $R_{vr} = 1.5 \\text{ mmHg/(L/min)}$.\n$$\n\\Delta VR = \\frac{3 \\text{ mmHg}}{1.5 \\text{ mmHg/(L/min)}} = 2 \\text{ L/min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe change in mean systemic filling pressure is $\\Delta P_{msf} = 3 \\text{ mmHg}$, which, expressed to three significant figures, is $3.00 \\text{ mmHg}$.\nThe change in venous return is $\\Delta VR = 2 \\text{ L/min}$, which, expressed to three significant figures, is $2.00 \\text{ L/min}$.\n\nThe final values are $\\Delta P_{msf} = 3.00 \\text{ mmHg}$ and $\\Delta VR = 2.00 \\text{ L/min}$.",

The internal pressure is $P$, and the resulting circumferential stress in the wall is $\\sigma$. To find the relationship between these quantities, we apply the principle of mechanical equilibrium.\n\nConsider the sphere to be cut into two hemispheres. The force exerted by the internal pressure tends to push the two hemispheres apart. This force, $F_{\\text{pressure}}$, is equal to the pressure $P$ multiplied by the projected area of the hemisphere onto the plane of the cut, which is a circle of radius $r$.\n$$ F_{\\text{pressure}} = P \\times (\\pi r^2) $$\n\nThis outward force is counteracted by the tensile force within the wall material at the cut.

The wall stress is $\\sigma_0$, the systolic pressure is $P_0$, the radius is $r_0$, and the wall thickness is $h_0$.
