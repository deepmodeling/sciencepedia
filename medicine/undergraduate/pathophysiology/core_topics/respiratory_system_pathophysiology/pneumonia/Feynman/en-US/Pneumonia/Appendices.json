This process thickens the delicate alveolar-capillary membrane, the very surface across which oxygen must travel to enter the bloodstream.

            "problem": "In the context of pneumonia, inflammatory edema increases the thickness of the alveolar–capillary barrier, impairing oxygen transfer. Consider oxygen diffusing at steady state across a uniform, plane alveolar–capillary membrane of thickness $T$ and area $A$, from the alveolar gas side with oxygen partial pressure $P_{1}$ to the capillary blood side with oxygen partial pressure $P_{2}$, where $P_{1} > P_{2}$. Assume the diffusion coefficient of oxygen within the membrane material is $D_{T}$ (treated as constant across $x$), the oxygen concentration within the membrane phase is proportional to the local oxygen partial pressure by Henry’s law with solubility $\\alpha$, that there is no reactive consumption within the membrane, and that the system is at steady state with a constant flux.\n\nStarting explicitly from Fick’s first law of diffusion $J(x) = - D_{T}\\,\\frac{dC}{dx}$ and Henry’s law $C(x) = \\alpha\\,P(x)$, derive an expression for the steady-state molar flow rate of oxygen $V_{O_{2}}$ across the membrane in terms of $A$, $T$, $P_{1}$, $P_{2}$, and a single effective diffusivity parameter $D$ you define from the physical parameters of the membrane and oxygen. Then, model pneumonia-induced edema as a doubling of membrane thickness to $2T$ while $A$, $D$, $P_{1}$, and $P_{2}$ remain unchanged. Compute the fractional reduction in $V_{O_{2}}$ relative to its baseline (pre-edema) value, defined as $\\frac{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}} - V_{O_{2},\\text{edema}}}{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to derive an expression for the steady-state molar flow rate of oxygen ($V_{O_2}$) and then calculate the fractional reduction in flow when the membrane thickness doubles.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Molar Flow Rate**\n\nWe start from the two given physical laws:\n1.  **Fick's first law of diffusion**, which states that the molar flux $J(x)$ is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n    $$ J(x) = -D_T \\frac{dC}{dx} $$\n    where $D_T$ is the diffusion coefficient in the membrane tissue.\n2.  **Henry's law**, which relates the concentration of a dissolved gas $C(x)$ to its partial pressure $P(x)$:\n    $$ C(x) = \\alpha P(x) $$\n    where $\\alpha$ is the solubility coefficient.\n\nWe can substitute Henry's law into Fick's law to express the flux in terms of the partial pressure gradient. Since $\\alpha$ and $D_T$ are constants:\n$$ J(x) = -D_T \\frac{d(\\alpha P(x))}{dx} = -D_T \\alpha \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\n\nThe problem asks us to define a single effective diffusivity parameter $D$. We define it as $D = D_T \\alpha$. The equation for flux becomes:\n$$ J(x) = -D \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\n\nAt steady state, the flux $J$ is constant across the membrane (i.e., it does not change with position $x$). We can solve this ordinary differential equation by separating variables and integrating across the membrane from the alveolar side ($x=0$, pressure $P_1$) to the capillary side ($x=T$, pressure $P_2$):\n$$ J \\, dx = -D \\, dP $$\n$$ \\int_{x=0}^{x=T} J \\, dx = \\int_{P=P_1}^{P=P_2} -D \\, dP $$\nSince $J$ and $D$ are constants with respect to the integration variables:\n$$ J \\int_{0}^{T} dx = -D \\int_{P_1}^{P_2} dP $$\n$$ J [x]_0^T = -D [P]_{P_1}^{P_2} $$\n$$ J(T - 0) = -D(P_2 - P_1) $$\n$$ JT = D(P_1 - P_2) $$\n\nSolving for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{D(P_1 - P_2)}{T} $$\n\nThe total molar flow rate, $V_{O_2}$, is the flux per unit area ($J$) multiplied by the total membrane area ($A$):\n$$ V_{O_2} = J \\cdot A = \\frac{D A (P_1 - P_2)}{T} $$\nThis is the required expression for the molar flow rate.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Fractional Reduction**\n\nLet $V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}$ be the flow rate in the healthy lung with membrane thickness $T$:\n$$ V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}} = \\frac{D A (P_1 - P_2)}{T} $$\n\nIn pneumonia with edema, the membrane thickness doubles to $2T$. The new flow rate, $V_{O_{2},\\text{edema}}$, is:\n$$ V_{O_{2},\\text{edema}} = \\frac{D A (P_1 - P_2)}{2T} $$\n\nWe can see the relationship between the two flow rates:\n$$ V_{O_{2},\\text{edema}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{D A (P_1 - P_2)}{T} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}} $$\n\nThe fractional reduction is defined as $\\frac{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}} - V_{O_{2},\\text{edema}}}{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}}$. Substituting the relationship we found:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Reduction} = \\frac{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}}{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}}{V_{O_{2},\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe fractional reduction in oxygen flow rate is $0.5$.",

Calculate the oxygen content of pulmonary end-capillary blood ($C_{c'O_2}$). This requires first calculating the ideal alveolar oxygen partial pressure ($P_{AO_2}$), as end-capillary blood is assumed to be fully equilibrated with alveolar gas.\n3.  Substitute these content values into the shunt equation to find $Q_s/Q_t$.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate $C_{aO_2}$ and $C_{vO_2}$**\n\nUsing the given data for arterial blood ($S_{aO_2} = 0.88$, $P_{aO_2} = 60\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$) and the constants ($\\mathrm{Hb} = 13.0\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$, $k_{Hb} = 1.34\\ \\mathrm{mL/g}$, $\\alpha_{O_2} = 0.0031\\ \\mathrm{mL/(dL\\ mmHg)}$):\n$$ C_{aO_2} = (13.0 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.88) + (60 \\times 0.0031) $$\n$$ C_{aO_2} = 15.3296 + 0.186 = 15.5156\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL} $$\nUsing the given data for mixed venous blood ($S_{vO_2} = 0.65$, $P_{vO_2} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$):\n$$ C_{vO_2} = (13.0 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.65) + (40 \\times 0.0031) $$\n$$ C_{vO_2} = 11.323 + 0.124 = 11.447\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL} $$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate $C_{c'O_2}$**\n\nTo find $C_{c'O_2}$, we first need the partial pressure of oxygen in the end-capillaries, $P_{c'O_2}$.

We calculate $P_{AO_2}$ using the alveolar gas equation:\n$$ P_{AO_2} = F_{IO_2} \\times (P_B - P_{H_2O}) - \\frac{P_{aCO_2}}{R} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ P_{AO_2} = 0.60 \\times (760 - 47) - \\frac{50}{0.80} $$\n$$ P_{AO_2} = 0.60 \\times 713 - 62.5 $$\n$$ P_{AO_2} = 427.8 - 62.5 = 365.3\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} $$\nTherefore, $P_{c'O_2} = P_{AO_2} = 365.3\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. At this high partial pressure of oxygen, the hemoglobin in the end-capillary blood is considered fully saturated, thus $S_{c'O_2} = 1.0$.\nNow we can calculate $C_{c'O_2}$:\n$$ C_{c'O_2} = (\\mathrm{Hb} \\times k_{Hb} \\times S_{c'O_2}) + (P_{c'O_2} \\times \\alpha_{O_2}) $$\n$$ C_{c'O_2} = (13.0 \\times 1.34 \\times 1.0) + (365.3 \\times 0.0031) $$\n$$ C_{c'O_2} = 17.42 + 1.13243 = 18.55243\\ \\mathrm{mL/dL} $$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Shunt Fraction $Q_s/Q_t$**\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated oxygen contents into the shunt equation:\n$$ \\frac{Q_s}{Q_t} = \\frac{C_{c'O_2} - C_{aO_2}}{C_{c'O_2} - C_{vO_2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{Q_s}{Q_t} = \\frac{18.55243 - 15.5156}{18.55243 - 11.447} $$\n$$ \\frac{Q_s}{Q_t} = \\frac{3.03683}{7.10543} \\approx 0.42740 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $0.427$.

            "solution": "### Derivation of Elastic Work of Breathing\n\nThe mechanical work ($W$) done on the lungs during inspiration is the work done by the transpulmonary pressure ($P_L$) to expand the lung volume ($V$). From first principles in mechanics, the infinitesimal work $dW$ done by a pressure $P$ to cause a change in volume $dV$ is given by:\n$$dW = P dV$$\nThe total work done during an inspiration of tidal volume $V_T$ is the integral of pressure with respect to volume over the inspired volume range.\n$$W = \\int_{V_0}^{V_0+V_T} P_L(V) dV$$\nwhere $V_0$ is the initial volume, corresponding to the Functional Residual Capacity (FRC).\n\nThe problem states to assume a linear pressure-volume relationship. Static compliance, $C$, is defined as the change in volume per unit change in pressure:\n$$C = \\frac{dV}{dP_L}$$\nFor a linear relationship, $C$ is constant over the tidal volume range. We can express the pressure as a function of volume change. Let $\\Delta V = V - V_0$ be the volume inspired above FRC. The corresponding change in transpulmonary pressure, $\\Delta P_L$, is:\n$$\\Delta P_L = \\frac{\\Delta V}{C}$$\nWe can define the pressure axis such that the pressure required to hold the lungs at FRC is the reference pressure, $\\Delta P_L = 0$ at $\\Delta V = 0$.
