            "problem": "You are to formalize a simplified dynamical systems model of the Vicious Cycle Hypothesis in bronchiectasis as a set of dimensionless ordinary differential equations derived from mass-balance and proportionality principles. The system tracks the evolution of four state variables over a dimensionless time $t$: bacterial burden $B(t)$, inflammatory activity $I(t)$, mucus burden $M(t)$, and mucociliary clearance (MCC) function $F(t)$. The model must start from the following foundational bases: (i) population dynamics where the rate of change is the difference between production and removal, (ii) logistic growth constrained by a carrying capacity, and (iii) proportional interaction terms that reflect contact-dependent effects, leading to multiplicative terms. You must work only in dimensionless units and provide a numerical solution by time-stepping. No physical units are used in this problem.\n\nConstruct the system from the following generally accepted mechanisms in bronchiectasis pathophysiology, expressed as dimensionless rate equations:\n- Bacteria grow logistically with intrinsic rate $r_B$ and carrying capacity $K_B$, and are removed by clearance proportional to the product of $F$ and $B$, and by immunity proportional to the product of $I$ and $B$.\n- Inflammation is activated by bacteria in proportion to $B$ and decays at a rate proportional to $I$.\n- Mucus production is stimulated by inflammation in proportion to $I$ and decays at a rate proportional to $M$.\n- Mucociliary function $F$ recovers toward a baseline $F_{\\text{base}}$ at a rate proportional to the difference $F_{\\text{base}}-F$, and is impaired in proportion to the products $M F$ and $I F$.\n\nUsing these principles, implement the following dimensionless system:\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = r_B\\, B\\left(1-\\frac{B}{K_B}\\right) - k_{\\text{clear}}\\,F\\,B - a_I\\, I\\, B,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = s_B\\, B - d_I\\, I,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = s_I\\, I - d_M\\, M,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = r_F\\,(F_{\\text{base}} - F) - c_M\\, M\\, F - c_I\\, I\\, F.\n$$\n\nUse explicit Euler time-stepping with fixed step size $dt$ over a time horizon $T_{\\text{end}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the numerical solution of a system of four coupled, first-order, nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that model the Vicious Cycle Hypothesis in bronchiectasis. The state of the system is described by four dimensionless variables: bacterial burden $B(t)$, inflammatory activity $I(t)$, mucus burden $M(t)$, and mucociliary clearance (MCC) function $F(t)$. The evolution of these variables over a dimensionless time $t$ is governed by the following system:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dB}{dt} = r_B\\, B\\left(1-\\frac{B}{K_B}\\right) - k_{\\text{clear}}\\,F\\,B - a_I\\, I\\, B\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = s_B\\, B - d_I\\, I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = s_I\\, I - d_M\\, M\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = r_F\\,(F_{\\text{base}} - F) - c_M\\, M\\, F - c_I\\, I\\, F\n$$\n\nWe will solve this initial value problem numerically using the explicit Euler method. This method approximates the state of the system at time $t + dt$ based on its state and rate of change at time $t$.

The state at the next step, $\\mathbf{Y}_{n+1}$, is calculated as follows:\n$B_{n+1} = B_n + dt \\cdot \\left[ r_B\\, B_n\\left(1-\\frac{B_n}{K_B}\\right) - k_{\\text{clear}}\\,F_n\\,B_n - a_I\\, I_n\\, B_n \\right]$\n$I_{n+1} = I_n + dt \\cdot \\left[ s_B\\, B_n - d_I\\, I_n \\right]$\n$M_{n+1} = M_n + dt \\cdot \\left[ s_I\\, I_n - d_M\\, M_n \\right]$\n$F_{n+1} = F_n + dt \\cdot \\left[ r_F\\,(F_{\\text{base}} - F_n) - c_M\\, M_n\\, F_n - c_I\\, I_n\\, F_n \\right]$\n\nThe simulation starts at $t=0$ with the given initial conditions $\\{B(0), I(0), M(0), F(0)\\}$ and proceeds for a total time $T_{\\text{end}} = 50.0$ using a fixed time step of $dt = 0.01$. The number of steps is $N = T_{\\text{end}}/dt = 5000$.\n\nAfter each time step, the following biologically plausible constraints are enforced by clamping the values:\n$B_{n+1} = \\max(0, B_{n+1})$\n$I_{n+1} = \\max(0, I_{n+1})$\n$M_{n+1} = \\max(0, M_{n+1})$\n$F_{n+1} = \\max(0, \\min(F_{\\text{base}}, F_{n+1}))$\n\nThis procedure is repeated for each of the four test cases provided.

A sustained vicious cycle is declared to be present (i.e., the result is `True`) if either $B(T_{\\text{end}}) \\ge B_{\\text{crit}}$ or $F(T_{\\text{end}}) \\le F_{\\text{crit}}$, where the critical thresholds are given as $B_{\\text{crit}} = 0.3$ and $F_{\\text{crit}} = 0.5$.

            "solution": "This problem requires calculating the change in body mass over 21 days by applying the principle of energy conservation: `Change in Body Energy = Energy In - Energy Out`.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE)**\nThis is the \"Energy Out\" part of the equation. We start with the baseline Resting Energy Expenditure (REE) and apply adjustments.\n\n1.  **Baseline REE**: $REE_{base} = 1500$ kcal/day.\n2.  **Fever Adjustment**: The patient's temperature is $38.5^\\circ\\text{C}$, which is $\\Delta T = 38.5 - 37.0 = 1.5^\\circ\\text{C}$ above normal. The REE increases by $10\\%$ for each degree Celsius.\n    $$REE_{fever} = REE_{base} \\times (1 + 0.10 \\times \\Delta T) = 1500 \\times (1 + 0.10 \\times 1.5) = 1500 \\times 1.15 = 1725 \\text{ kcal/day}$$\n3.  **Work of Breathing (WOB) Adjustment**: This adds a $20\\%$ increase to the fever-adjusted REE.\n    $$REE_{adj} = REE_{fever} \\times 1.20 = 1725 \\times 1.20 = 2070 \\text{ kcal/day}$$\n4.  **Activity Adjustment**: The final TDEE is found by multiplying the adjusted REE by the activity factor.\n    $$TDEE = REE_{adj} \\times 1.10 = 2070 \\times 1.10 = 2277 \\text{ kcal/day}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Metabolizable Energy Intake ($E_{in}$)**\nThis is the \"Energy In\" part, representing the calories actually absorbed from the diet. The total consumed energy is $2200$ kcal/day.\n\n1.  **Energy from Fat**:\n    - Intake: $2200 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.45 = 990$ kcal\n    - Absorbed: $990 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.70 = 693$ kcal\n2.  **Energy from Carbohydrate**:\n    - Intake: $2200 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.40 = 880$ kcal\n    - Absorbed: $880 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.98 = 862.4$ kcal\n3.  **Energy from Protein**:\n    - Intake: $2200 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.15 = 330$ kcal\n    - Absorbed: $330 \\text{ kcal} \\times 0.95 = 313.5$ kcal\n\nTotal daily metabolizable energy is the sum of the absorbed components:\n$$E_{in} = 693 + 862.4 + 313.5 = 1868.9 \\text{ kcal/day}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Total Energy Balance and Mass Change**\nNow we can find the daily energy deficit and the total mass change over 21 days.\n\n1.  **Daily Energy Balance**:\n    $$\\Delta E_{daily} = E_{in} - TDEE = 1868.9 - 2277 = -408.1 \\text{ kcal/day}$$\n2.  **Total Energy Balance over 21 days**:\n    $$\\Delta E_{total} = \\Delta E_{daily} \\times 21 \\text{ days} = -408.1 \\times 21 = -8570.1 \\text{ kcal}$$\n3.  **Mass Change**: The energy deficit is assumed to be met by metabolizing adipose tissue, which has an energy density of $7700$ kcal/kg.\n    $$\\Delta m = \\frac{\\Delta E_{total}}{\\text{Energy density of adipose tissue}} = \\frac{-8570.1 \\text{ kcal}}{7700 \\text{ kcal/kg}} \\approx -1.113 \\text{ kg}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the predicted change in body mass is $-1.11$ kg.",
