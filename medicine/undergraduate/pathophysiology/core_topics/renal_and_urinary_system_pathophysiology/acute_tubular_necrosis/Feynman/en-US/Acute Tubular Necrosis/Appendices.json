The Fractional Excretion of Sodium ($FeNa$) is a cornerstone diagnostic index that measures what percentage of sodium filtered by the glomeruli is ultimately excreted in the urine.

Round your final value to four significant figures. Finally, based on physiological principles of sodium handling in prerenal states versus intrinsic tubular injury, state whether the computed value is consistent with ATN.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, a derivation of the formula for the Fractional Excretion of Sodium ($FeNa$); second, a calculation of $FeNa$ using the provided patient data; and third, an interpretation of the result in the clinical context of Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN) versus a prerenal state.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the FeNa Formula\n\nThe Fractional Excretion of Sodium ($FeNa$) is defined as the fraction of the sodium load filtered by the glomeruli that is ultimately excreted in the urine. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Sodium Excretion}}{\\text{Rate of Sodium Filtration}}\n$$\n\nThe rate of excretion of any substance is determined by its concentration in the urine ($U_x$) multiplied by the urine flow rate ($V$). For sodium ($Na$), the rate of excretion is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Sodium Excretion} = U_{Na} \\times V\n$$\n\nThe rate of filtration of a freely filtered substance at the glomerulus is determined by its concentration in the plasma ($P_x$) multiplied by the Glomerular Filtration Rate ($GFR$). For sodium, which is freely filtered, the rate of filtration is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Sodium Filtration} = P_{Na} \\times GFR\n$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of $FeNa$:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times GFR}\n$$\n\nTo proceed, we need an expression for $GFR$. The problem states that creatinine clearance ($C_{Cr}$) can be used to approximate $GFR$. The general formula for the renal clearance of a substance $x$ is:\n$$\nC_x = \\frac{U_x \\times V}{P_x}\n$$\n\nApplying this to creatinine ($Cr$), we get:\n$$\nC_{Cr} = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}}\n$$\n\nUsing the provided assumption that $GFR \\approx C_{Cr}$, we can substitute the expression for $C_{Cr}$ in place of $GFR$ in the $FeNa$ equation:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be cancelled out:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{Cr}}{P_{Cr}} \\right)}\n$$\n\nRearranging this expression gives the final, standard formula for $FeNa$ in terms of the four measured concentrations:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\times U_{Cr}}\n$$\nThis derived expression is dimensionless, as the units for sodium concentration (e.g., $\\mathrm{mEq/L}$) and creatinine concentration (e.g., $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$) cancel out respectively.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of FeNa\n\nWe are given the following laboratory values for the patient:\n- Urine sodium ($U_{Na}$) = $60 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- Plasma sodium ($P_{Na}$) = $140 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- Urine creatinine ($U_{Cr}$) = $80 \\, \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- Plasma creatinine ($P_{Cr}$) = $2.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{60 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L} \\times 2.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/dL}}{140 \\, \\mathrm{mEq/L} \\times 80 \\, \\mathrm{mg/dL}}\n$$\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{120}{11200}\n$$\n$$\nFeNa = \\frac{12}{1120} = \\frac{3}{280}\n$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\nFeNa \\approx 0.0107142857...\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is $1$. Counting four digits from there gives $0.01071$.\n$$\nFeNa \\approx 0.01071\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Interpretation of the Result\n\nThe calculated $FeNa$ is approximately $0.01071$, which is equivalent to $1.071 \\%$. To interpret this value, we must consider the distinct pathophysiological responses of the kidney in a prerenal state versus intrinsic tubular injury (ATN).\n\nIn a **prerenal state**, such as that caused by hypotension, the renal tubules are structurally intact and functionally responsive. The hypoperfusion triggers a strong neurohormonal response, primarily activating the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). Aldosterone acts on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts to aggressively reabsorb sodium (and water) in an attempt to restore circulating volume. This results in highly concentrated urine with a very low sodium content. Consequently, in a prerenal state, the $FeNa$ is typically very low, with a standard clinical cutoff of less than 1% (i.e., a decimal fraction less than $0.01$).\n\nIn **Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN)**, prolonged ischemia (as caused by the patient's prolonged hypotension) or nephrotoxins have caused structural damage to the tubular epithelial cells. These damaged cells lose their ability to perform their transport functions, including the reabsorption of sodium. As a result, sodium that is filtered by the glomerulus is not effectively reabsorbed and is \"wasted\" into the urine. This leads to a higher urine sodium concentration and an elevated $FeNa$. The clinical cutoff indicating intrinsic tubular damage is typically a $FeNa$ greater than 2% (a decimal fraction of $0.02$), although values greater than 1% (a decimal fraction of $0.01$) are highly suggestive of ATN, especially when a prerenal state would be expected to produce a much lower value.\n\nThe patient's calculated $FeNa$ of $1.071 \\%$ falls just above the $1 \\%$ threshold. In the context of prolonged hypotension, a healthy kidney's response would be to conserve sodium maximally, leading to a $FeNa$ well below $1 \\%$. The fact that the $FeNa$ is greater than $1 \\%$ indicates an impaired tubular capacity for sodium reabsorption. This impairment is the defining functional defect in ATN. Therefore, the computed value is consistent with the diagnosis of Acute Tubular Necrosis.",

            "problem": "A clinician is distinguishing prerenal azotemia from intrinsic Acute Tubular Injury/Necrosis (ATN) in two oliguric patients using fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa) and fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea). By definition, fractional excretion is the fraction of the filtered load of a solute that is excreted in urine, operationalized clinically as the ratio of its clearance to that of creatinine. Assume creatinine is handled as a freely filtered marker with negligible tubular reabsorption and secretion for the purposes of this question. Consider the nephron physiology that in hypovolemia there is avid proximal and collecting duct reabsorption of sodium and urea, that loop and thiazide diuretics act on tubular sodium reabsorption but do not directly inhibit urea transporters, and that antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increases urea permeability in the inner medullary collecting duct.\n\nPatient 1 (received intravenous (IV) furosemide 40 mg, given 4 hours prior to sampling): plasma sodium 140 mEq/L, plasma creatinine 2.0 mg/dL, plasma urea nitrogen 40 mg/dL; urine sodium 80 mEq/L, urine creatinine 40 mg/dL, urine urea nitrogen 200 mg/dL.

It is well-posed, providing all necessary data for calculation and interpretation. There are no scientific or logical contradictions, and the language is objective.\n\nThe core task is to calculate the fractional excretion of sodium ($FeNa$) and urea ($FeUrea$) for two patients and interpret these values in the context of their clinical presentation and known physiological principles.\n\nThe fractional excretion of a solute $X$, denoted $FeX$, is defined as the ratio of its clearance to the clearance of creatinine ($Cr$).\n$$\nFeX = \\frac{C_X}{C_{Cr}}\n$$\nWhere the clearance of a substance $S$ is given by $C_S = \\frac{U_S \\cdot V}{P_S}$, with $U_S$ being the urine concentration, $P_S$ the plasma concentration, and $V$ the urine flow rate.\nSubstituting the clearance formulas:\n$$\nFeX = \\frac{U_X \\cdot V / P_X}{U_{Cr} \\cdot V / P_{Cr}} = \\frac{U_X \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_X \\cdot U_{Cr}}\n$$\nThis formula will be used for both sodium ($Na$) and urea. For urea, we are given blood urea nitrogen ($BUN$) and urine urea nitrogen ($UUN$), which can be used as surrogates for plasma and urine urea concentrations, respectively, as the conversion factor cancels out in the ratio. We will denote these as $P_{UN}$ and $U_{UN}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the indices for Patient 1.\nPatient 1 data:\n$P_{Na} = 140 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n$U_{Na} = 80 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n$P_{Cr} = 2.0 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$U_{Cr} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$P_{UN} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$U_{UN} = 200 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nFractional Excretion of Sodium for Patient 1 ($FeNa_1$):\n$$\nFeNa_1 = \\frac{U_{Na} \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\cdot U_{Cr}} = \\frac{80 \\cdot 2.0}{140 \\cdot 40} = \\frac{160}{5600} = \\frac{1}{35} \\approx 0.0286\n$$\nAs a percentage, $FeNa_1 \\approx 2.86\\%$.\n\nFractional Excretion of Urea for Patient 1 ($FeUrea_1$):\n$$\nFeUrea_1 = \\frac{U_{UN} \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{UN} \\cdot U_{Cr}} = \\frac{200 \\cdot 2.0}{40 \\cdot 40} = \\frac{400}{1600} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\nAs a percentage, $FeUrea_1 = 25\\%$.\n\nNext, we calculate the indices for Patient 2.\nPatient 2 data:\n$P_{Na} = 138 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n$U_{Na} = 50 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n$P_{Cr} = 3.0 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$U_{Cr} = 30 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$P_{UN} = 40 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n$U_{UN} = 240 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nFractional Excretion of Sodium for Patient 2 ($FeNa_2$):\n$$\nFeNa_2 = \\frac{U_{Na} \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{Na} \\cdot U_{Cr}} = \\frac{50 \\cdot 3.0}{138 \\cdot 30} = \\frac{150}{4140} = \\frac{5}{138} \\approx 0.0362\n$$\nAs a percentage, $FeNa_2 \\approx 3.62\\%$.\n\nFractional Excretion of Urea for Patient 2 ($FeUrea_2$):\n$$\nFeUrea_2 = \\frac{U_{UN} \\cdot P_{Cr}}{P_{UN} \\cdot U_{Cr}} = \\frac{240 \\cdot 3.0}{40 \\cdot 30} = \\frac{720}{1200} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.60\n$$\nAs a percentage, $FeUrea_2 = 60\\%$.\n\nInterpretation based on physiological principles:\n- **Prerenal azotemia:** The kidneys are structurally intact but underperfused. They respond by avidly conserving sodium and water to restore volume. This leads to a low $FeNa$ (typically $ 1\\%$). The accompanying high levels of ADH enhance water and urea reabsorption in the collecting ducts, leading to a low $FeUrea$ (typically $ 35\\%$).\n- **Acute Tubular Injury/Necrosis (ATN):** The tubular cells are damaged and cannot effectively reabsorb solutes. This leads to wasting of sodium and urea, resulting in a high $FeNa$ (typically $ 2\\%$) and a high $FeUrea$ (typically $ 50\\%$).\n- **Loop Diuretics (Furosemide):** These drugs block the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle, a major site of sodium reabsorption. This action forces sodium excretion (natriuresis), thereby pharmacologically increasing the $FeNa$, regardless of the underlying physiological state.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. In Patient 1, FeNa substantially overestimates tubular damage due to the loop diuretic, whereas FeUrea more accurately indicates prerenal physiology.**\nFor Patient 1, we calculated $FeNa_1 \\approx 2.86\\%$. This value is in the range typically seen in ATN. However, the patient received furosemide, which is known to elevate $FeNa$. The patient's clinical context is volume depletion, suggestive of a prerenal state. We also calculated $FeUrea_1 = 25\\%$. This value is low and is characteristic of prerenal physiology, where urea reabsorption is enhanced. The diuretic does not directly affect urea transporters, so $FeUrea$ reflects the underlying state more accurately. The high $FeNa$ is a pharmacological artifact, thus \"overestimating tubular damage.\" This statement is fully consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Loop diuretics invalidate FeUrea by directly blocking urea transport in the inner medullary collecting duct.**\nThe problem statement explicitly notes that \"loop and thiazide diuretics act on tubular sodium reabsorption but do not directly inhibit urea transporters.\" Loop diuretics' target is the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter in the thick ascending limb, not urea transporters in the collecting duct. This statement is factually incorrect and contradicts the premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In Patient 2, both FeNa and FeUrea are consistent with intrinsic tubular injury.**\nFor Patient 2, who has sepsis-associated acute kidney injury and received no diuretics, we calculated $FeNa_2 \\approx 3.62\\%$ and $FeUrea_2 = 60\\%$. Both values are elevated well into the range characteristic of intrinsic tubular injury ($FeNa  2\\%$ and $FeUrea  50\\%$). This indicates that the tubules are damaged and are unable to properly reabsorb sodium and urea. The results align with the suspected diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. FeUrea outperforms FeNa in patients recently exposed to loop or thiazide diuretics because urea reabsorption is concentrated in the proximal tubule and inner medullary collecting duct, segments unaffected by these diuretics and potentiated by antidiuretic hormone during hypovolemia.**\nThis statement provides the physiological rationale for using $FeUrea$.\n1.  Loop diuretics act on the thick ascending limb, and thiazides on the distal convoluted tubule.\n2.  Urea reabsorption occurs mainly in the proximal tubule (passively) and the inner medullary collecting duct (actively via transporters like UT-A1).\n3.  These urea reabsorption sites are indeed anatomically and functionally distinct from the sites of action of these diuretics.\n4.  In hypovolemia (the prerenal state), ADH levels are high. ADH increases the expression and activity of urea transporters in the collecting duct, enhancing urea reabsorption and lowering $FeUrea$.\nThis entire chain of reasoning is correct and explains why $FeUrea$ remains a valid marker of the volume state when $FeNa$ is confounded by diuretics.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. FeNa remains reliable after loop diuretics because these drugs act after the majority of sodium has already been reabsorbed, so their effect on FeNa is negligible.**\nThe proximal tubule reabsorbs approximately $65\\%$ of filtered sodium. The thick ascending limb (TAL), the site of loop diuretic action, reabsorbs another $20-25\\%$ of the filtered load. While the proximal tubule absorbs the majority, the load presented to and reabsorbed by the TAL is substantial. Blocking this reabsorption has a powerful natriuretic effect. Claiming this effect is \"negligible\" is physiologically and clinically incorrect. The data from Patient $1$, where $FeNa$ is driven from a presumed prerenal value of $1\\%$ to $2.86\\%$, empirically disproves this claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A pediatric unit wants to standardize the initial diagnostic approach to acute kidney injury (AKI) in children by integrating fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FeUrea), urine osmolality, and urine sediment microscopy. The goal is to distinguish prerenal azotemia, intrinsic renal causes including acute tubular necrosis (ATN), glomerulonephritis, and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), and postrenal obstruction, in a manner robust to common confounders. The algorithm must: prioritize data with the highest immediate diagnostic specificity, account for loop diuretic exposure and neonatal tubular immaturity, and use physiologically justified thresholds for electrolyte handling and concentrating ability. Acronyms on first use: fractional excretion of sodium (FeNa), fractional excretion of urea nitrogen (FeUrea), acute tubular necrosis (ATN), acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), red blood cell (RBC), white blood cell (WBC).\n\nWhich option best describes a stepwise algorithm that meets these criteria?\n\nA. Begin with urine sediment microscopy to identify diagnostic casts or cells: dysmorphic RBCs and RBC casts suggest glomerulonephritis; WBC casts or eosinophils suggest AIN; muddy brown granular casts suggest ATN; abundant crystals with suggestive history can indicate obstructive crystalluria; a bland or hyaline cast–predominant sediment keeps prerenal versus early ATN in play. Concurrently, if oliguria or anuria is present or history suggests obstruction, rule out postrenal obstruction with bedside bladder scan and renal ultrasonography. If sediment is nondiagnostic and obstruction is excluded, then evaluate renal handling: in children not exposed to loop diuretics in the previous $24$ to $48$ hours and beyond the neonatal period, use FeNa and urine osmolality together, where FeNa  1% with urine osmolality  500 to 600 mOsm/kg favors prerenal physiology, and FeNa  2% with urine osmolality  350 mOsm/kg favors ATN; intermediate values prompt reassessment after volume optimization. If loop diuretics were given recently or the patient is a neonate, prioritize FeUrea (FeUrea  35% prerenal, FeUrea  50% intrinsic) over FeNa, and interpret neonatal FeNa cautiously because immature tubules can yield FeNa up to approximately $2$ to $3\\%$ even in prerenal states. Integrate trends over time and the clinical context to reconcile discordant results.\n\nB. Start with FeNa in all children and classify as prerenal if FeNa $1\\%$ and intrinsic if FeNa $\\geq1\\%$.

A solution can be derived by evaluating the options against established principles of pediatric nephrology.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\nA robust diagnostic algorithm for AKI must be structured logically, prioritizing tests that offer high specificity and can rapidly identify or exclude specific etiologies, while correctly handling common confounders.\n\n1.  **Initial Steps**: The first priorities should be to identify conditions that are emergent or have highly specific diagnostic markers.\n    - **Postrenal Obstruction**: This is a rapidly reversible cause of AKI. Clinical signs like anuria or a palpable bladder warrant immediate investigation with a bladder scan and renal ultrasonography. This should be a very early step.\n    - **Urine Sediment Microscopy**: This test can be pathognomonic. Red blood cell (RBC) casts point strongly to glomerulonephritis. White blood cell (WBC) casts point to tubulointerstitial inflammation (like pyelonephritis or AIN). Muddy brown granular casts are highly specific for ATN. The high diagnostic yield of these findings means sediment analysis should be performed early.\n\n2.  **Differentiating Prerenal vs. Intrinsic (ATN)**: If obstruction is ruled out and the sediment is non-diagnostic (e.g., bland sediment, hyaline casts), the next step is to assess tubular function. This is where FeNa, FeUrea, and osmolality are used.\n\n3.  **Handling Confounders (Diuretics and Age)**: The interpretation of these indices is highly dependent on clinical context.\n    - **Loop Diuretics**: These drugs block sodium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, artificially elevating FeNa. They also impair urinary concentration. Therefore, in a patient exposed to loop diuretics, FeNa and urine osmolality are unreliable for diagnosing a prerenal state. Fractional excretion of urea (FeUrea) is the preferred test, as urea handling is less affected by these diuretics.\n    - **Neonatal Physiology**: Neonates, particularly premature infants, have physiologically immature renal tubules. This leads to a reduced ability to reabsorb sodium and concentrate urine, even when hypovolemic. As a result, a \"prerenal\" neonate might have an FeNa of $2\\%-3\\%$, a value that would suggest ATN in an older child. FeUrea is therefore also preferred in this population.\n\n4.  **Physiologically Justified Thresholds**:\n    - For an older child without diuretic exposure:\n        - Prerenal: $\\text{FeNa}  1\\%$ and Urine Osmolality $ 500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$.\n        - Intrinsic (ATN): $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$ and Urine Osmolality $ 350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$.\n    - With diuretic exposure or in neonates:\n        - Prerenal: $\\text{FeUrea}  35\\%$.\n        - Intrinsic (ATN): $\\text{FeUrea}  50\\%$.\n\nBased on these principles, let's evaluate each option.\n\n**A.

Integrate trends over time and the clinical context to reconcile discordant results.**\n\nThis option describes a comprehensive and correct algorithm.\n- It correctly prioritizes high-specificity tests first: urine microscopy and imaging for obstruction.\n- It correctly describes the pathognomonic findings on sediment.\n- It employs a logical secondary step (evaluating tubular function) for non-diagnostic initial findings.\n- It correctly identifies the standard context (no diuretics, older child) for using FeNa and urine osmolality, applying the correct, physiologically justified thresholds ($\\text{FeNa}  1\\%$, $\\text{U}_{\\text{osm}}  500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$ for prerenal; $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$, $\\text{U}_{\\text{osm}}  350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$ for ATN).\n- It correctly identifies the specific situations (diuretic use, neonates) where FeNa is unreliable and FeUrea should be prioritized, using the correct thresholds ($\\text{FeUrea}  35\\%$ for prerenal).\n- It provides a correct physiological explanation for the cautious interpretation of FeNa in neonates.\n- It emphasizes the importance of clinical integration and trends.\nTherefore, this option meets all criteria specified in the problem statement.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. Start with FeNa in all children and classify as prerenal if FeNa $1\\%$ and intrinsic if FeNa $\\geq1\\%$. Use urine osmolality only if FeNa is between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$, and check sediment after these steps. Consider loop diuretics and age effects negligible for FeNa interpretation. Evaluate for obstruction only if anuria persists beyond $48$ hours.**\n\nThis option is incorrect for multiple reasons.\n- Starting with FeNa is not the optimal approach as it ignores the high immediate specificity of sediment and the need to rule out obstruction.\n- The cutoff of $\\text{FeNa} \\geq 1\\%$ for intrinsic AKI is an oversimplification and incorrect; values between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$ are typically considered indeterminate.\n- Stating that loop diuretic and age effects are \"negligible\" for FeNa interpretation is fundamentally wrong and clinically dangerous. This directly contravenes the problem requirements.\n- Delaying evaluation for obstruction for $48$ hours is inappropriate and can lead to irreversible kidney damage.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Use urine osmolality as the primary discriminator: osmolality $400$ mOsm/kg indicates prerenal azotemia, and osmolality $200$ mOsm/kg indicates intrinsic AKI. If osmolality is between $200$ and $400$ mOsm/kg, then measure FeUrea to decide. Sediment is supportive only and RBC casts are interpreted as prerenal due to hemoconcentration. Loop diuretics do not affect the interpretation of these indices.**\n\nThis option is incorrect and contains dangerous misinformation.\n- Urine osmolality is not the best primary discriminator due to confounders.\n- The stated thresholds ($400$ and $200 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$) are not standard; the typical prerenal threshold is higher ($500 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$) and the intrinsic threshold is higher as well ($350 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$).\n- Interpreting RBC casts as \"prerenal\" is a critical error; they are a hallmark of glomerulonephritis, an intrinsic renal disease.\n- The claim that loop diuretics do not affect osmolality is false. They directly impair the kidney's concentrating ability.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Rely on FeUrea alone because it is universally reliable in pediatrics: FeUrea $50\\%$ defines prerenal azotemia and FeUrea $\\geq50\\%$ defines intrinsic AKI in all ages and medication exposures. Sediment and osmolality add little and should not be used in the initial algorithm. Postrenal obstruction can be excluded clinically without imaging.**\n\nThis option is incorrect and oversimplified.\n- No single test is \"universally reliable\". While FeUrea is valuable, it does not replace other key tests.\n- The prerenal cutoff for FeUrea is typically $35\\%$, not $50\\%$.\n- Dismissing sediment microscopy and imaging for obstruction is medically unsound. Sediment can provide a definitive diagnosis (e.g., glomerulonephritis), and imaging is essential to definitively rule out obstruction.\n- Claiming obstruction can be excluded clinically without imaging is unsafe.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. First, check urine sediment for casts, then use FeNa with a universal prerenal cutoff at FeNa $2\\%$ and intrinsic if FeNa $\\geq2\\%$ regardless of diuretic exposure or age. Urine osmolality is considered only if FeNa is indeterminate. FeUrea is reserved for rare cases because it is not affected by liver disease or malnutrition and is less useful than FeNa in children.**\n\nThis option is incorrect.\n- While starting with sediment is reasonable, the subsequent steps are flawed.\n- Using a universal cutoff of $\\text{FeNa}  2\\%$ for prerenal is incorrect; the standard cutoff is $1\\%$. Using a $2\\%$ threshold would misclassify many cases of ATN as prerenal.\n- Ignoring diuretic exposure and age is a critical error that violates the problem's explicit requirements.\n- The characterization of FeUrea is misleading. Its primary utility in this context is its robustness to diuretic effects, which is a common, not rare, clinical scenario.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**",
