This can be expressed as:\n$$P = E[L] + A + \\Pi$$\n\nThe problem specifies the components $A$ and $\\Pi$ as percentages of the premium $P$. We formalize these relationships:\nThe administrative expense load is $12\\%$ of the premium, which translates to:\n$$A = 0.12 P$$\n\nThe profit margin is $3\\%$ of the premium, which translates to:\n$$\\Pi = 0.03 P$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $A$ and $\\Pi$ into the cash flow identity equation:\n$$P = E[L] + 0.12 P + 0.03 P$$\n\nThe given value for the expected annual claim cost is $E[L] = 5000$ dollars. Substituting this value into the equation gives:\n$$P = 5000 + 0.12 P + 0.03 P$$\n\nWe can combine the terms that are proportional to $P$:\n$$P = 5000 + (0.12 + 0.03) P$$\n$$P = 5000 + 0.15 P$$\n\nTo solve for $P$, we must isolate the variable. We subtract $0.15 P$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$P - 0.15 P = 5000$$\n$$P(1 - 0.15) = 5000$$\n$$0.85 P = 5000$$\n\nFinally, we solve for $P$ by dividing both sides by $0.85$:\n$$P = \\frac{5000}{0.85}$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the numerical value for $P$:\n$$P \\approx 5882.352941...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures of the result are $5$, $8$, $8$, and $2$. The fifth significant digit is $3$. Since $3$ is less than $5$, we round down, which means we truncate the value after the fourth significant digit.\n\nTherefore, the rounded indicated premium is $5882$ U.S. dollars PMPY. This value represents the full premium required to cover the medical loss ratio (which is implicitly $0.85$ or $85\\%$) as well as the administrative costs and profit margin which together constitute the remaining $15\\%$.",

            "id": "4392426",
            "problem": "Consider an employer-sponsored health insurance plan with three standard cost-sharing features: a deductible $D$, a coinsurance rate $c$ (the fraction of allowed spending paid by the patient after the deductible is met), and an annual out-of-pocket maximum $M$. Assume $0<c<1$ and $0<D<M$. Out-of-pocket (OOP) means the patient’s direct payments for covered services (out-of-pocket (OOP) excludes premiums and assumes no copayments, and that all allowed spending is in-network and counts toward the deductible and the out-of-pocket maximum).\n\nAn enrollee’s annual allowed spending $X$ follows a two-point (two-mass) distribution: $X=x_{1}$ with probability $p$ and $X=x_{2}$ with probability $1-p$, where $x_{1}<D$ and $x_{2}$ is sufficiently large that the out-of-pocket maximum binds once the deductible is met and coinsurance is applied.

The mathematical framework (expected value of a discrete random variable) is fundamental. The problem is a valid and simplified model of a real-world scenario.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information and constraints to define a function for out-of-pocket spending and to calculate its expected value. The conditions on $x_1$ and $x_2$ are precise and remove ambiguity. A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from any subjectivity.\n4.  **Consistency Check**: The condition $x_2 \\ge D + \\frac{M-D}{c}$ ensures that for the high-spending state, the enrollee's cost-sharing obligation, if uncapped, would meet or exceed the out-of-pocket maximum. The constraints $0 < c < 1$ and $0 < D < M$ are internally consistent and reflect typical insurance plan structures. The problem is free from internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe solution proceeds by first defining the enrollee's out-of-pocket spending, $O(X)$, as a function of their total allowed medical spending, $X$. This function is constructed from the definitions of deductible, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket maximum. Then, the expected value is calculated using the given probability distribution of $X$.\n\nLet $O(X)$ be the out-of-pocket spending for a given amount of total allowed spending $X$. The function $O(X)$ is piecewise, based on the relationship between $X$ and the deductible $D$.\n\n1.  **Spending below or at the deductible**: If the total spending $X$ is less than or equal to the deductible $D$, the enrollee is responsible for the full amount.\n    $$O(X) = X, \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le X \\le D$$\n\n2.  **Spending above the deductible**: If the total spending $X$ exceeds the deductible $D$, the enrollee first pays the full deductible $D$. For all spending beyond $D$, the enrollee pays a fraction $c$ (the coinsurance). The potential OOP spending in this case would be $D + c(X-D)$.\n\n3.  **The Out-of-Pocket Maximum**: The enrollee's total OOP spending for the year is capped at the maximum $M$. Therefore, the expression from step $2$ must be limited by $M$.\n\nCombining these rules, the complete function for out-of-pocket spending $O(X)$ is:\n$$\nO(X) = \\begin{cases}\nX & \\text{if } 0 \\le X \\le D \\\\\n\\min\\left(M, D + c(X-D)\\right) & \\text{if } X > D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate $O(X)$ for the two possible values of $X$: $x_1$ and $x_2$.\n\n-   **Case 1: Spending is $x_1$**.\n    The problem states that $x_1 < D$. This falls into the first part of our piecewise function for $O(X)$.\n    Therefore, the out-of-pocket spending is:\n    $$O(x_1) = x_1$$\n\n-   **Case 2: Spending is $x_2$**.\n    The problem states that $x_2 \\ge D + \\frac{M-D}{c}$. Since $M>D$ and $c>0$, it is necessary that $D + \\frac{M-D}{c} > D$. Thus, $x_2 > D$, which means this case falls into the second part of our piecewise function for $O(X)$.\n    The out-of-pocket spending is:\n    $$O(x_2) = \\min\\left(M, D + c(x_2-D)\\right)$$\n    We must evaluate the term $D + c(x_2-D)$ using the given condition on $x_2$.\n    From the condition $x_2 \\ge D + \\frac{M-D}{c}$, we can rearrange the inequality:\n    $$x_2 - D \\ge \\frac{M-D}{c}$$\n    Since $c$ is given as positive ($0 < c < 1$), we can multiply both sides by $c$ without changing the inequality direction:\n    $$c(x_2-D) \\ge M-D$$\n    Adding $D$ to both sides gives:\n    $$D + c(x_2-D) \\ge M$$\n    This result shows that the second argument of the $\\min$ function, $D + c(x_2-D)$, is greater than or equal to the first argument, $M$. The minimum of two values, where one is greater than or equal to the other, is the smaller value.\n    Therefore,\n    $$O(x_2) = \\min\\left(M, D + c(x_2-D)\\right) = M$$\n    This confirms the problem's premise that the out-of-pocket maximum binds in this state.\n\nFinally, we calculate the expected annual out-of-pocket spending, $\\mathbb{E}[O(X)]$. By definition, for a discrete random variable, the expected value is the sum of each possible outcome multiplied by its probability.\nThe random variable $O(X)$ can take two values: $O(x_1) = x_1$ with probability $p$, and $O(x_2) = M$ with probability $1-p$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[O(X)] = O(x_1) \\cdot P(X=x_1) + O(x_2) \\cdot P(X=x_2) $$\nSubstituting the values we derived:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[O(X)] = x_1 \\cdot p + M \\cdot (1-p) $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the expected annual OOP spending in terms of the given parameters. The parameters $x_2$, $D$, and $c$ were necessary to define the regime for the high-spending state but do not appear in the final expression because the spending in that state was sufficiently high to reach the OOP maximum, making the exact amount of spending (beyond that threshold) and the specific cost-sharing structure irrelevant to the final OOP cost in that state.",
