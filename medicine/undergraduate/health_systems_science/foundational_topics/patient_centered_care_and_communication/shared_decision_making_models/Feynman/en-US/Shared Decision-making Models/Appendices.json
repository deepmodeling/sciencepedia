The treatment threshold is set at $p^{*}=0.5$. The patient has a pretest probability of disease $p=0.3$ based on clinical assessment and a validated risk score. A diagnostic test is performed and returns a positive result ($+$). The test’s sensitivity is $0.9$ and its specificity is $0.8$.

The premises are factually and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: All necessary information is provided to calculate the required posterior probability. There are no missing data, and the constraints are consistent. The problem admits a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in clear, precise, and unbiased language. The terms are well-defined within the context of medical statistics.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard application of Bayesian inference.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of disease given a positive test result, denoted as $P(D \\mid +)$, where $D$ represents the event of having the disease and $+$ represents the event of a positive test result. We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe formula for Bayes' theorem is:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)} $$\n\nThe givens can be formally stated as:\n1.  The prior probability of disease, $P(D) = p = 0.3$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient has the disease, $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.9$.\n3.  The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the patient does not have the disease, $P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 0.8$. Here, $\\neg D$ represents the event of not having the disease.\n\nFrom these givens, we can derive other necessary probabilities:\n- The prior probability of not having the disease is the complement of having the disease:\n  $$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7 $$\n- The probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity:\n  $$ P(+ \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2 $$\n\nThe denominator in Bayes' theorem, $P(+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. This can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(+) = P(+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(+ \\mid \\neg D) P(\\neg D) $$\n\nSubstituting the known values into this formula:\n$$ P(+) = (0.9)(0.3) + (0.2)(0.7) $$\n$$ P(+) = 0.27 + 0.14 $$\n$$ P(+) = 0.41 $$\n\nNow we have all the components to calculate the posterior probability $P(D \\mid +)$:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)} = \\frac{(0.9)(0.3)}{0.41} $$\n$$ P(D \\mid +) = \\frac{0.27}{0.41} $$\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.65853658... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to three significant figures.\n$$ P(D \\mid +) \\approx 0.659 $$\n\nThe problem also asks to compare this to the treatment threshold, $p^{*} = 0.5$.\nSince $0.659 > 0.5$, the posterior probability of disease exceeds the treatment threshold. The initiation of treatment is justified based on this new information. The final answer required is the posterior probability itself.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to derive an expression for the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) in terms of the baseline risk ($p_{0}$) and the Relative Risk ($RR$). We are given the following definitions:\n1.  $ARR = p_{0} - p_{1}$\n2.  $RR = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}$\n\nFrom the definition of $RR$, we can express the risk with treatment, $p_{1}$, in terms of $p_{0}$ and $RR$:\n$$p_{1} = p_{0} \\times RR$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $p_{1}$ into the definition of $ARR$:\n$$ARR = p_{0} - (p_{0} \\times RR)$$\nFactoring out the common term $p_{0}$, we arrive at the desired expression for $ARR$:\n$$ARR = p_{0} (1 - RR)$$\nThis expression allows for the calculation of the individualized absolute risk reduction by applying a relative risk from a population study to an individual's specific baseline risk.\n\nThe second task is to compute the individualized $ARR$ for the patient described. The given values are $p_{0} = 0.4$ and $RR = 0.75$. Substituting these into our derived formula:\n$$ARR = 0.4 \\times (1 - 0.75)$$\n$$ARR = 0.4 \\times 0.25$$\n$$ARR = 0.1$$\nThus, the individualized absolute risk reduction for this patient is $0.1$, which means the program is expected to reduce their personal risk of readmission from $40\\%$ to $30\\%$ (since $p_{1} = p_{0} \\times RR = 0.4 \\times 0.75 = 0.3$). The absolute reduction is $0.4 - 0.3 = 0.1$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the corresponding Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$). We are given the definition:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the value of $ARR$ we just calculated:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.1}$$\n$$NNT = 10$$\nThe interpretation of this result is that, for a population of patients with this specific baseline risk, one would need to treat $10$ patients with the transitional care program to prevent one additional hospital readmission over the $90$-day period.",

            "introduction": "The ultimate decision to treat synthesizes both evidence about risk and a patient's unique values regarding potential benefits and harms. Expected utility theory provides a powerful framework for this synthesis by defining a \"treatment threshold\"—the specific probability of disease above which treatment becomes the preferred choice for that individual. This practice guides you through the derivation of this threshold, transforming subjective patient utilities into an objective and actionable decision rule .",

            "problem": "In a Shared Decision Making (SDM) conversation within health systems science, clinicians and patients can formalize the choice to treat or not treat as a decision under uncertainty using the expected utility principle. The foundational base is: the rational choice among actions is the one that maximizes the expected utility, computed as the probability-weighted sum of utilities across mutually exclusive and exhaustive states. Let $p$ denote the pretest probability of disease, and assume the standard decision states \"disease\" and \"no disease\" are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The utilities are quantified from the patient perspective on a cardinal utility scale: $u_{\\text{treat|disease}}=+10$, $u_{\\text{no treat|disease}}=-10$, $u_{\\text{treat|no disease}}=-3$, and $u_{\\text{no treat|no disease}}=0$. Starting from the expected utility principle and the law of total probability, derive the treatment threshold pretest probability $p^{\\ast}$ at which a patient would be indifferent between \"treat\" and \"no treat.\" Then, for a given pretest probability $p=0.25$, determine the preferred action by comparing expected utilities and encode the decision as $1$ for \"treat\" and $0$ for \"no treat.\" Express the final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}p^{\\ast} & \\text{decision}\\end{pmatrix}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in decision theory, well-posed with all necessary information, and stated objectively. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to apply the principle of expected utility. The expected utility of an action is the sum of the utilities of its possible outcomes, each weighted by the probability of that outcome. The two possible actions are \"treat\" and \"no treat\". The two possible states of nature are \"disease\" and \"no disease\".\n\nLet $p$ be the pretest probability of disease. Then, the probability of \"no disease\" is $1-p$, as the states are mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The given utilities are:\n-   Utility of treating when the patient has the disease: $u_{\\text{treat|disease}} = 10$\n-   Utility of not treating when the patient has the disease: $u_{\\text{no treat|disease}} = -10$\n-   Utility of treating when the patient does not have the disease: $u_{\\text{treat|no disease}} = -3$\n-   Utility of not treating when the patient does not have the disease: $u_{\\text{no treat|no disease}} = 0$\n\nFirst, we formulate the expected utility for each action as a function of $p$.\n\nThe expected utility of the \"treat\" action, $EU(\\text{treat})$, is calculated as:\n$$EU(\\text{treat}) = p \\cdot u_{\\text{treat|disease}} + (1-p) \\cdot u_{\\text{treat|no disease}}$$\nSubstituting the given utility values:\n$$EU(\\text{treat}) = p(10) + (1-p)(-3) = 10p - 3 + 3p$$\n$$EU(\\text{treat}) = 13p - 3$$\n\nThe expected utility of the \"no treat\" action, $EU(\\text{no treat})$, is calculated as:\n$$EU(\\text{no treat}) = p \\cdot u_{\\text{no treat|disease}} + (1-p) \\cdot u_{\\text{no treat|no disease}}$$\nSubstituting the given utility values:\n$$EU(\\text{no treat}) = p(-10) + (1-p)(0)$$\n$$EU(\\text{no treat}) = -10p$$\n\nThe treatment threshold probability, $p^{\\ast}$, is the value of $p$ at which a rational agent would be indifferent between the two actions. This occurs when their expected utilities are equal.\n$$EU(\\text{treat}) = EU(\\text{no treat})$$\nWe set the expressions for the expected utilities equal to each other and solve for $p = p^{\\ast}$:\n$$13p^{\\ast} - 3 = -10p^{\\ast}$$\nTo solve for $p^{\\ast}$, we gather the terms involving $p^{\\ast}$ on one side:\n$$13p^{\\ast} + 10p^{\\ast} = 3$$\n$$23p^{\\ast} = 3$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{23}$$\nThis is the first part of the answer.\n\nNext, we must determine the preferred action for a given pretest probability $p = 0.25$.\nThe decision rule is to choose the action with the higher expected utility. We can determine this by comparing $p$ to the derived threshold $p^{\\ast}$.\nLet's analyze the difference in expected utilities, $\\Delta EU = EU(\\text{treat}) - EU(\\text{no treat})$:\n$$\\Delta EU = (13p - 3) - (-10p) = 23p - 3$$\nThe \"treat\" action is preferred if $\\Delta EU > 0$, which implies $23p - 3 > 0$, or $p > \\frac{3}{23}$.\nThe \"no treat\" action is preferred if $\\Delta EU < 0$, which implies $23p - 3 < 0$, or $p < \\frac{3}{23}$.\n\nWe are given $p = 0.25$, which is $\\frac{1}{4}$. We need to compare this value to $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{23}$.\nTo compare the fractions $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{3}{23}$, we can cross-multiply:\n-   $1 \\times 23 = 23$\n-   $3 \\times 4 = 12$\nSince $23 > 12$, we have $\\frac{1}{4} > \\frac{3}{23}$.\nTherefore, the given probability $p=0.25$ is greater than the threshold probability $p^{\\ast}$.\nBecause $p > p^{\\ast}$, the inequality $\\Delta EU > 0$ holds, meaning $EU(\\text{treat}) > EU(\\text{no treat})$. The preferred action is \"treat\".\n\nFor explicit verification, we can calculate the numerical values of the expected utilities at $p=0.25$:\n$$EU(\\text{treat}) = 13(0.25) - 3 = 13\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - 3 = \\frac{13}{4} - \\frac{12}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$EU(\\text{no treat}) = -10(0.25) = -10\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{10}{4} = -\\frac{5}{2}$$\nSince $\\frac{1}{4} > -\\frac{5}{2}$, the \"treat\" action is indeed preferred.\n\nFinally, we encode the decision as requested: $1$ for \"treat\" and $0$ for \"no treat\". Since the preferred action is \"treat\", the decision code is $1$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing $p^{\\ast}$ and the encoded decision.\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{3}{23}$$\n$$\\text{decision} = 1$$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{23} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
