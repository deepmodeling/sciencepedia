This exercise introduces you to queuing theory, a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing systems where customers (patients) arrive for a service. By modeling a clinic as a basic queue, you will derive key performance metrics from first principles, connecting abstract theory to tangible outcomes like average wait time ($W$) and the number of patients in the system ($L$). This practice will build your skills in quantifying system performance and understanding the critical relationship between resource utilization and patient delays.",

            "problem": "A single-physician acute care clinic operates as a single-server queue with Poisson arrivals and exponential service times, that is, a Kendall notation $M/M/1$ model. Patients arrive at rate $\\lambda$ patients per hour and are served at rate $\\mu$ patients per hour. Assume the system is stable, meaning the traffic intensity $\\rho=\\lambda/\\mu$ satisfies $\\rho<1$. The health system’s quality improvement team wants to quantify congestion and time in system at this station to support a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) learning cycle.\n\nStarting only from fundamental birth–death steady-state balance for such a Markov chain and well-established facts from queueing theory and operations, including Little’s Law $L=\\lambda W$, derive the steady-state average number of patients in the system $L$ and the steady-state average time a patient spends in the system $W$ for the case $\\lambda=\\;10$ patients per hour and $\\mu=\\;12$ patients per hour. Use the definition of the stationary distribution induced by the birth–death process to obtain $L$ without invoking any pre-memorized closed-form queue formulas, and then apply Little’s Law to obtain $W$.\n\nBriefly interpret the operational implications of your computed $L$ and $W$ in the context of clinic flow and resource utilization to inform potential quality improvement actions. Express $W$ in hours and $L$ in patients. Give exact values; no rounding is required.\n\nReport your final numerical values for $(L,W)$ as a single row matrix in the order $(L, W)$, with no units inside the matrix.",
            "solution": "The clinic is modeled as an $M/M/1$ queue, which corresponds to a continuous-time Markov chain known as a birth-death process. Let the state of the system, $n$, be the number of patients in the clinic (both waiting and being served), where $n \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe arrival rate (birth rate) is constant for all states: $\\lambda_n = \\lambda$ for $n \\ge 0$.\nThe service rate (death rate) depends on the state. If the system is empty ($n=0$), the death rate is $\\mu_0 = 0$. If there is at least one patient ($n \\ge 1$), the single physician is busy, and the service completion rate is $\\mu_n = \\mu$.\n\nIn steady state, the rate of flow into any state $n$ must equal the rate of flow out of that state. For a birth-death process, this leads to the detailed balance equations:\n$$\n\\lambda_{n-1} P_{n-1} = \\mu_n P_n \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1\n$$\nwhere $P_n$ is the steady-state probability of being in state $n$.\n\nLet's apply these equations for our specific case:\nFor $n=1$: $\\lambda_0 P_0 = \\mu_1 P_1 \\implies \\lambda P_0 = \\mu P_1$.\nThis gives $P_1 = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\\right) P_0$. We define the traffic intensity as $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}$, so $P_1 = \\rho P_0$.\n\nFor $n=2$: $\\lambda_1 P_1 = \\mu_2 P_2 \\implies \\lambda P_1 = \\mu P_2$.\nThis gives $P_2 = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}\\right) P_1 = \\rho P_1$. Substituting the expression for $P_1$, we get $P_2 = \\rho (\\rho P_0) = \\rho^2 P_0$.\n\nBy induction, we can establish the general relationship for any state $n \\ge 0$:\n$$\nP_n = \\rho^n P_0\n$$\n\nTo find the value of $P_0$, we use the normalization condition that the sum of all probabilities must equal $1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} P_n = 1\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $P_n$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n P_0 = P_0 \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = 1\n$$\nThe summation is a geometric series. Since the system is stable, we are given that $\\rho < 1$, so the series converges:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\n$$\nTherefore, $P_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}\\right) = 1$, which implies that the probability of the system being empty is $P_0 = 1-\\rho$.\n\nThe complete stationary distribution for the number of patients in the system is:\n$$\nP_n = (1-\\rho)\\rho^n \\quad \\text{for } n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots\n$$\nThis is a geometric distribution on the non-negative integers.\n\nNext, we derive the average number of patients in the system, $L$, by calculating the expected value of the number of patients, $N$.\n$$\nL = E[N] = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n P_n = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n (1-\\rho)\\rho^n = (1-\\rho) \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n\n$$\nTo evaluate the summation $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n$, we use a standard technique involving the derivative of the geometric series. Let $S(\\rho) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = \\frac{1}{1-\\rho}$.\nDifferentiating $S(\\rho)$ with respect to $\\rho$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dS}{d\\rho} = \\frac{d}{d\\rho} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\rho^n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n \\rho^{n-1} = \\frac{1}{(1-\\rho)^2}\n$$\nMultiplying by $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{dS}{d\\rho} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n = \\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\rho)^2}\n$$\nSince the $n=0$ term in the sum is zero, $\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n \\rho^n$.\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $L$:\n$$\nL = (1-\\rho) \\left( \\frac{\\rho}{(1-\\rho)^2} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the average number of patients in an $M/M/1$ system.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\nArrival rate $\\lambda = 10$ patients per hour.\nService rate $\\mu = 12$ patients per hour.\n\nThe traffic intensity is $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} = \\frac{10}{12} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\nThe stability condition $\\rho < 1$ is met.\n\nThe average number of patients in the system, $L$, is:\n$$\nL = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{5/6}{1 - 5/6} = \\frac{5/6}{1/6} = 5\n$$\nSo, $L = 5$ patients.\n\nTo find the average time a patient spends in the system, $W$, we use Little's Law, which states $L = \\lambda W$.\n$$\nW = \\frac{L}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the values we found:\n$$\nW = \\frac{5 \\text{ patients}}{10 \\text{ patients/hour}} = 0.5 \\text{ hours}\n$$\nSo, $W = 0.5$ hours.\n\nBrief interpretation for quality improvement:\nThe calculated traffic intensity is $\\rho = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$, or $83.3\\%$. This indicates the physician is busy over $83\\%$ of the time, representing high resource utilization. The average number of patients in the clinic, $L=5$, and the average time a patient spends from arrival to departure, $W=0.5$ hours (or $30$ minutes), quantify the level of congestion. These metrics serve as a baseline for a Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle. Since queue length and waiting time are highly sensitive to utilization as it approaches $100\\%$ (due to the $1-\\rho$ denominator), the high utilization rate of $83.3\\%$ signals a risk of significant congestion if patient arrivals increase or physician service time lengthens even slightly. A quality improvement team could use these baseline values ($L=5$, $W=0.5$) to test interventions aimed at, for example, increasing the service rate $\\mu$ (e.g., through process efficiencies like scribes or improved electronic health records) and measure the impact on these key performance indicators.",

            "introduction": "Once a process is understood, the next critical question is whether it is capable of meeting its goals. This practice introduces process capability analysis, a core quality improvement technique used to determine if a process can consistently produce output within its required specification limits. By calculating the capability indices $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$ for an Emergency Department's triage process, you will learn to distinguish between a process's potential capability and its actual, centered performance. This exercise is essential for moving beyond simple process monitoring to making data-driven judgments about performance and identifying specific operational risks.",

            "problem": "A hospital’s Emergency Department (ED) is assessing the capability of its triage process time relative to an internal service specification defined by a lower specification limit (LSL) of $60$ minutes and an upper specification limit (USL) of $120$ minutes. Over the last month, with stable operations and subgroup sampling supporting approximate normality, the estimated short-term standard deviation is $\\sigma=10$ minutes and the current process mean is $\\mu=95$ minutes. Using only foundational definitions from capability analysis in quality improvement (namely, that the natural process spread is taken as $\\pm 3\\sigma$ under approximate normality and that capability compares specification width to this spread, while accounting for centering by comparing the mean to each specification boundary in standardized units), compute the process capability index $C_p$ and the centered process capability index $C_{pk}$. Report the pair $\\left(C_p,\\,C_{pk}\\right)$ as unitless numbers and round your answers to three significant figures. Then, based on capability analysis principles, briefly interpret which side (upper or lower specification) dominates the operational risk of out-of-specification performance and whether the process appears capable relative to the specification.",
            "solution": "The objective is to calculate the process capability indices $C_p$ and $C_{pk}$ and interpret the results. These indices measure how well the process output fits within the customer-defined specification limits.\n\nThe process capability index, $C_p$, measures the potential capability of the process by comparing the total specification width to the natural process spread. It does not account for the centering of the process. The problem defines the natural process spread as corresponding to a total width of $6\\sigma$.\n\nThe formula for $C_p$ is:\n$$C_p = \\frac{\\text{Specification Width}}{\\text{Process Spread}} = \\frac{USL - LSL}{6\\sigma}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $USL = 120$ minutes\n- $LSL = 60$ minutes\n- $\\sigma = 10$ minutes\n\n$$C_p = \\frac{120 - 60}{6 \\times 10} = \\frac{60}{60} = 1$$\nTo report this to three significant figures, we write $C_p = 1.00$.\n\nThe centered process capability index, $C_{pk}$, measures the actual capability of the process by accounting for its centering relative to the specification limits. It is defined as the minimum of the upper and lower capability indices, $C_{pu}$ and $C_{pl}$, respectively. These indices measure the distance from the process mean to the nearest specification limit in units of $3\\sigma$.\n\nThe formulas for $C_{pl}$ and $C_{pu}$ are:\n$$C_{pl} = \\frac{\\mu - LSL}{3\\sigma}$$\n$$C_{pu} = \\frac{USL - \\mu}{3\\sigma}$$\nAnd $C_{pk}$ is given by:\n$$C_{pk} = \\min(C_{pl}, C_{pu})$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $\\mu = 95$ minutes\n- $LSL = 60$ minutes\n- $USL = 120$ minutes\n- $\\sigma = 10$ minutes\n\nFirst, calculate $C_{pl}$:\n$$C_{pl} = \\frac{95 - 60}{3 \\times 10} = \\frac{35}{30} = \\frac{7}{6} \\approx 1.1666...$$\nNext, calculate $C_{pu}$:\n$$C_{pu} = \\frac{120 - 95}{3 \\times 10} = \\frac{25}{30} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333...$$\nNow, find $C_{pk}$ by taking the minimum of these two values:\n$$C_{pk} = \\min\\left(\\frac{7}{6}, \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$C_{pk} \\approx 0.8333... \\approx 0.833$$\nThe resulting pair is $\\left(C_p, C_{pk}\\right) = \\left(1.00, 0.833\\right)$.\n\n### Interpretation\n1.  **Dominant Operational Risk**: The operational risk is determined by a comparison of $C_{pl}$ and $C_{pu}$. Since $C_{pk}$ is the minimum of the two, the side corresponding to the minimum value is the one closer to its specification limit and thus presents the greater risk of producing out-of-specification results. Here, $C_{pu} \\approx 0.833$ is less than $C_{pl} \\approx 1.17$. This indicates that the process mean ($\\mu=95$) is closer to the upper specification limit ($USL=120$) than to the lower specification limit ($LSL=60$), in terms of process standard deviations. Therefore, the **upper specification side dominates the operational risk**, meaning there is a higher probability of triage times exceeding the $120$-minute maximum than falling below the $60$-minute minimum.\n\n2.  **Process Capability**: A widely accepted minimum value for a process to be considered \"capable\" is $C_{pk} \\ge 1.33$. A value of $C_{pk} < 1.00$ indicates that the process is not capable, as parts of the natural process distribution fall outside the specification limits. In this case, $C_{pk} \\approx 0.833$, which is significantly less than $1.00$. Therefore, the process is **not capable** of consistently meeting the specified triage time requirements. The value $C_p = 1.00$ indicates that the process variability ($6\\sigma = 60$ min) is exactly as wide as the specification range ($USL - LSL = 60$ min). This means that even if the process were perfectly centered, it would just barely fit within the limits. The fact that $C_{pk}$ is substantially lower than $C_p$ confirms that the primary issue is the process being off-center.",

            "problem": "A hospital pharmacy undertakes a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to improve safety in its medication-ordering process. The team rates three distinct failure modes using the standard $1$ to $10$ ordinal scales for severity, occurrence, and detection difficulty. Let severity be denoted by $s$, occurrence by $o$, and detection difficulty by $d$. The three failure modes and their ratings are:\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{A}$: $s=7$, $o=3$, $d=7$.\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{B}$: $s=5$, $o=8$, $d=2$.\n\nFailure mode $\\mathrm{C}$: $s=9$, $o=2$, $d=9$.\n\nUsing widely accepted practice, the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is defined as the multiplicative aggregation of the three ratings. Compute the RPN for each failure mode.\n\nNext, starting from core definitions in probability and expected value, critically examine whether multiplying three ordinal ratings yields a cardinal risk quantity that is interpretable on a meaningful scale. Then, derive a more principled prioritization metric based on expected harm per medication order under the following scientifically grounded modeling assumptions:\n\n- Severity mapping: Let the harm magnitude function be $h(s)=\\exp(\\alpha\\,(s-6))$. Calibrate $\\alpha$ using the anchor that a severity rating of $s=8$ represents four times the harm of a severity rating of $s=6$.\n\n- Occurrence mapping: Let the base probability of the failure mode occurring on a single medication order be $p(o)=\\gamma\\,o$. Assume that at $o=10$ the base probability is $p_{\\max}=0.02$ per order, and determine $\\gamma$ accordingly.\n\n- Detection mapping: Let the probability that the failure escapes detection be $q(d)=\\frac{d}{10}$.\n\nAssume independence between the occurrence of the failure and detection processes, and define the expected harm per order for failure mode $i$ as $E_i=h(s_i)\\,p(o_i)\\,q(d_i)$. For each failure mode, compute $E_i$ and identify which failure mode should be prioritized under this expected harm metric. Finally, report the expected harm of the prioritized failure mode per $1{,}000$ medication orders. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in relative harm units per $1{,}000$ orders.",
            "solution": "The first part of the problem requires the computation of the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for three failure modes. The RPN is defined as the product of the ratings for severity ($s$), occurrence ($o$), and detection difficulty ($d$). The formula is $\\text{RPN} = s \\times o \\times d$.\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{A}$, with $s_A=7$, $o_A=3$, and $d_A=7$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_A = 7 \\times 3 \\times 7 = 147 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{B}$, with $s_B=5$, $o_B=8$, and $d_B=2$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_B = 5 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 80 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{C}$, with $s_C=9$, $o_C=2$, and $d_C=9$:\n$$ \\text{RPN}_C = 9 \\times 2 \\times 9 = 162 $$\n\nBased on these RPN values, the prioritization order would be $\\mathrm{C} > \\mathrm{A} > \\mathrm{B}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a critical examination of the practice of multiplying ordinal ratings to yield a cardinal risk quantity. The ratings for severity, occurrence, and detection are provided on $1$-to-$10$ ordinal scales. Ordinal scales preserve only rank order; for instance, a severity of $s=8$ is understood to be more severe than $s=4$, but it cannot be concluded that it is \"twice as severe\". The intervals between consecutive numbers on the scale are not guaranteed to be uniform or meaningful. Arithmetic operations such as multiplication are mathematically defined for cardinal (specifically, ratio) scales, where there is a true, non-arbitrary zero and equal intervals between scale points. Multiplying numbers from ordinal scales is a mathematically invalid operation because it treats the ordinal ranks as if they were cardinal quantities. The resulting RPN is a dimensionless index, not a cardinal quantity with a clear, interpretable meaning. An RPN of $200$ is not necessarily twice the risk of an RPN of $100$. This method can also produce misleading priorities, as different combinations of $s$, $o$, and $d$ (e.g., $s=10, o=2, d=5$ versus $s=5, o=5, d=4$) can yield the same RPN ($100$) despite representing qualitatively different risk profiles. The multiplicative model implicitly assumes relationships (e.g., linearity, equal weight) between the scales and risk that are not justified a priori.\n\nThe third part requires deriving a more principled metric based on expected harm per order, $E_i=h(s_i)\\,p(o_i)\\,q(d_i)$. This requires calibrating the functions $h(s)$, $p(o)$, and $q(d)$.\n\nFirst, we calibrate the harm magnitude function, $h(s)=\\exp(\\alpha\\,(s-6))$.\nThe calibration condition is that a severity of $s=8$ represents four times the harm of $s=6$, which translates to $h(8) = 4 \\times h(6)$.\nSubstituting the function definition:\n$$ \\exp(\\alpha\\,(8-6)) = 4 \\times \\exp(\\alpha\\,(6-6)) $$\n$$ \\exp(2\\alpha) = 4 \\times \\exp(0) = 4 \\times 1 = 4 $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(\\exp(2\\alpha)) = \\ln(4) $$\n$$ 2\\alpha = \\ln(2^2) = 2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\ln(2) $$\nThus, the harm function is $h(s) = \\exp(\\ln(2)\\,(s-6)) = (\\exp(\\ln(2)))^{s-6} = 2^{s-6}$. The harm is measured in relative units where $h(6)=1$.\n\nNext, we calibrate the occurrence probability function, $p(o)=\\gamma\\,o$.\nThe condition is that at $o=10$, the probability is $p(10) = p_{\\max} = 0.02$.\n$$ \\gamma \\times 10 = 0.02 $$\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{0.02}{10} = 0.002 $$\nThus, the occurrence probability function is $p(o) = 0.002\\,o$.\n\nThe probability of a failure escaping detection is given directly as $q(d) = \\frac{d}{10}$.\n\nNow we can write the full expression for the expected harm per order, $E_i$:\n$$ E_i = h(s_i) \\, p(o_i) \\, q(d_i) = (2^{s_i-6}) \\times (0.002 \\cdot o_i) \\times \\left(\\frac{d_i}{10}\\right) $$\n$$ E_i = (0.0002) \\cdot o_i \\cdot d_i \\cdot 2^{s_i-6} $$\n\nWe now compute $E_i$ for each failure mode.\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{A}$ ($s_A=7$, $o_A=3$, $d_A=7$):\n$$ E_A = (0.0002) \\times 3 \\times 7 \\times 2^{7-6} = 0.0042 \\times 2^1 = 0.0084 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{B}$ ($s_B=5$, $o_B=8$, $d_B=2$):\n$$ E_B = (0.0002) \\times 8 \\times 2 \\times 2^{5-6} = 0.0032 \\times 2^{-1} = 0.0032 \\times 0.5 = 0.0016 $$\n\nFor Failure Mode $\\mathrm{C}$ ($s_C=9$, $o_C=2$, $d_C=9$):\n$$ E_C = (0.0002) \\times 2 \\times 9 \\times 2^{9-6} = 0.0036 \\times 2^3 = 0.0036 \\times 8 = 0.0288 $$\n\nComparing the expected harm values: $E_A = 0.0084$, $E_B = 0.0016$, and $E_C = 0.0288$.\nThe prioritization based on expected harm is $\\mathrm{C} > \\mathrm{A} > \\mathrm{B}$, since $0.0288 > 0.0084 > 0.0016$. In this specific case, the ranking matches the RPN-based ranking. However, the expected harm metric provides a cardinal measure of risk. For example, the risk of failure mode $\\mathrm{C}$ is $E_C/E_A = 0.0288 / 0.0084 \\approx 3.43$ times greater than that of mode $\\mathrm{A}$, whereas the RPN ratio of $\\text{RPN}_C/\\text{RPN}_A = 162/147 \\approx 1.10$ significantly understates this difference. The prioritized failure mode is $\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe final task is to report the expected harm of the prioritized failure mode ($\\mathrm{C}$) per $1{,}000$ medication orders. The expected harm per order is $E_C = 0.0288$ relative harm units.\nThe expected harm per $1{,}000$ orders is:\n$$ E_{C, 1000} = E_C \\times 1000 = 0.0288 \\times 1000 = 28.8 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ 28.80 $$",
