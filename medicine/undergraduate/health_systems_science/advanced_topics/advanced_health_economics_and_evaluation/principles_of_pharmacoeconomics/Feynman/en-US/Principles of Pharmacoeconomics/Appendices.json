A foundational principle is that we cannot simply sum monetary values from different time periods due to the time value of money, which encompasses both time preference and the opportunity cost of capital. This exercise  introduces the essential technique of discounting, which converts future costs into their equivalent present value, enabling a fair and accurate comparison of multi-year health programs.",

Assume costs are valued in a constant price year with no inflation and the real annual discount rate is $r=0.03$.

Express the final numerical result in dollars and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a first-principles explanation of discounting, a derivation of the present value formula, and its application to a given cost stream.\n\nFirst, we define discounting from first principles. In economics and finance, discounting is the process of determining the present value of a future payment or stream of payments. The need for discounting arises from the time value of money, a concept based on two fundamental principles: time preference and the opportunity cost of capital.\n\n1.  **Time Preference**: This is the principle that, all else being equal, individuals and societies prefer to receive benefits or incur costs sooner rather than later. A cost of $\\$1,000$ today is perceived as more impactful than a cost of $\\$1,000$ in the future. This preference for present satisfaction over future satisfaction means that future values must be adjusted, or 'discounted', to be directly comparable to present values.\n\n2.  **Opportunity Cost of Capital**: This principle recognizes that money available in the present can be invested to earn a positive rate of return. If a sum of money, which we can denote as its present value $PV$, is invested today at an annual rate of return $r$, it will grow to a future value $FV$ in one year according to the relation $FV = PV \\times (1+r)$. Conversely, a cost $C_1$ that must be paid one year from now is equivalent to a smaller amount of money today. This smaller amount is the present value, $PV$, which if invested today at the rate $r$, would grow to exactly $C_1$ in one year. The real discount rate, $r$, quantifies this opportunity cost—it is the rate of return forgone on capital that is committed to the program.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the present value ($PV$) of a stream of end-of-year costs using discrete annual compounding. Let $r$ be the annual discount rate. The relationship between a value at present ($PV$) and its equivalent value one year in the future ($FV_1$) is $FV_1 = PV \\times (1+r)$. Rearranging this, the present value of a future amount $C_1$ to be paid at the end of year $1$ is:\n$$PV_1 = \\frac{C_1}{(1+r)}$$\nFor a cost $C_2$ to be paid at the end of year $2$, we must discount it twice to bring it back to present value. Its value at the end of year $1$ is $\\frac{C_2}{1+r}$. To find its value at time $t=0$, we discount this amount once more:\n$$PV_2 = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{C_2}{1+r} \\right)}{1+r} = \\frac{C_2}{(1+r)^2}$$\nBy induction, the present value, $PV_t$, of a single cost $C_t$ incurred at the end of year $t$ is given by the formula:\n$$PV_t = \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nFor a stream of future costs $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_n$ incurred at the end of years $1, 2, \\dots, n$, the total present value, which we will denote simply as $PV$, is the sum of the present values of each individual cost:\n$$PV = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} PV_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThis is the general derived expression for the present value of a stream of discrete, end-of-year costs.\n\nFinally, we apply this formula to the specific cost stream provided in the problem. The givens are:\n-   A stream of costs: $C_1 = \\$1,000$, $C_2 = \\$1,000$, $C_3 = \\$1,000$.\n-   The time horizon is $n=3$ years.\n-   The real annual discount rate is $r=0.03$.\n\nThe costs are in a constant price year, so no inflation adjustments are necessary, and the real discount rate is appropriate. We substitute these values into the derived summation formula:\n$$PV = \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^1} + \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^2} + \\frac{1000}{(1+0.03)^3}$$\n$$PV = \\frac{1000}{1.03} + \\frac{1000}{(1.03)^2} + \\frac{1000}{(1.03)^3}$$\nWe calculate the value of each term:\n$$PV = 1000 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{1.03} + \\frac{1}{1.0609} + \\frac{1}{1.092727} \\right)$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times (0.970873786... + 0.942595908... + 0.915141658...)$$\n$$PV \\approx 1000 \\times (2.82861135...)$$\n$$PV \\approx 2828.61135$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is approximately $2828.61$. The first four significant figures are $2$, $8$, $2$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$PV \\approx 2829$$\nThe present value of the cost stream is $\\$2829$.",

            "introduction": "To measure the effectiveness of a health intervention, we need a metric that captures improvements in both length and quality of life; the Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) serves this purpose. Just as costs must be discounted to reflect their present value, so too must future health benefits to ensure a consistent comparison. This practice  challenges you to apply the same principle of discounting to QALYs, a crucial step in standardizing the evaluation of health outcomes over time.",
            "id": "4584712",
            "problem": "In clinical pharmacology, the concept of Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) is defined by weighting each unit of time by a health state utility, where utility is a cardinal value on the interval $\\left[0,1\\right]$ anchored at $0$ for death and $1$ for full health. Under the principles of pharmacoeconomics, future health effects are discounted to their present value to reflect time preference, consistent with the standard law of discrete compounding. Specifically, a benefit realized at the end of year $t$ has a present value obtained by dividing by $\\left(1 + r\\right)^{t}$, where $r$ is the annual discount rate.\n\nA national health payer evaluates a therapy that maintains a constant health state utility of $u = 0.8$ for $T = 5$ consecutive years. Assume the patient remains in this health state without mortality during the evaluation horizon, utility accrues evenly within each year but is valued at the end of each year, and discounting uses a constant annual rate $r = 0.03$ under discrete compounding.\n\nStarting from the above fundamentals and definitions, derive the appropriate present-value expression for the total discounted QALYs over $T = 5$ years for constant utility $u$, and then calculate the numerical value for $u = 0.8$, $T = 5$, and $r = 0.03$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total present value of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) over a specified period. According to the provided definitions, one year lived in a health state with utility $u$ generates $u$ QALYs for that year. The problem specifies that this utility value, $u$, is constant for $T=5$ years.\n\nFurther, the problem states that the utility gained in each year is valued at the end of that year. The principle of discrete discounting dictates that a value (or benefit) realized at the end of year $t$ must be discounted to its present value by dividing by the factor $(1+r)^t$.\n\nLet $Q_{PV}$ be the total discounted QALYs. This total is the sum of the present values of the QALYs gained in each year from year $t=1$ to year $t=T$.\n\nThe QALYs gained in year $1$, valued at the end of year $1$, have a present value of:\n$$ PV_1 = \\frac{u}{(1+r)^1} $$\nThe QALYs gained in year $2$, valued at the end of year $2$, have a present value of:\n$$ PV_2 = \\frac{u}{(1+r)^2} $$\nThis pattern continues up to the final year, $T$. The QALYs gained in year $t$ have a present value of:\n$$ PV_t = \\frac{u}{(1+r)^t} $$\nThe total discounted QALYs, $Q_{PV}$, is the sum of these present values for $t=1, 2, \\dots, T$:\n$$ Q_{PV} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} PV_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{u}{(1+r)^t} $$\nSince the utility $u$ is constant, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$ Q_{PV} = u \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} $$\nThe summation is a finite geometric series.

            "solution": "1) Definition of Dominance in Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Analysis\n\nLet there be two treatment strategies, Strategy $A$ and Strategy $B$, with associated costs $C_A$ and $C_B$, and effectiveness measures $E_A$ and $E_B$, respectively.\n\nStrict Dominance: A strategy is strictly dominated if there is another strategy that is both more effective and less costly. Specifically, Strategy $B$ is strictly dominated by Strategy $A$ if and only if $C_A  C_B$ and $E_A  E_B$. A strictly dominated strategy is unequivocally inferior and should be removed from consideration.\n\nWeak (Extended) Dominance: This concept arises in the comparison of three or more strategies. When strategies are ordered by increasing effectiveness, an intermediate strategy is considered weakly or extendedly dominated if the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to reach it from a less effective strategy is greater than the ICER to reach a more effective strategy from that same baseline. Let strategies $A$, $B$, and $C$ be ordered by increasing effectiveness, such that $E_A  E_B  E_C$. Strategy $B$ is weakly dominated if the ICER of moving from $A$ to $B$ is greater than the ICER of moving from $A$ to $C$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A}  \\frac{C_C - C_A}{E_C - E_A} $$\nThis implies that Strategy $B$ lies above the line segment connecting strategies $A$ and $C$ on the cost-effectiveness plane, making it an inefficient choice.\n\n2) Identification of Dominated Strategies\n\nFirst, the three strategies are ordered by increasing effectiveness (QALYs):\nStrategy 1: $(E_1, C_1) = (1.00, \\$9,000)$\nStrategy 3: $(E_3, C_3) = (1.08, \\$15,000)$\nStrategy 2: $(E_2, C_2) = (1.10, \\$12,000)$\n\nNext, we check for dominance based on this ordering. We compare each strategy to others to identify any that are less effective and more costly, or more effective and less costly.\n\nLet's compare Strategy 2 and Strategy 3.\nEffectiveness: $E_2 = 1.10$ QALYs and $E_3 = 1.08$ QALYs. So, $E_2  E_3$.\nCosts: $C_2 = \\$12,000$ and $C_3 = \\$15,000$. So, $C_2  C_3$.\nSince Strategy 2 is both more effective ($E_2  E_3$) and less costly ($C_2  C_3$) than Strategy 3, Strategy 3 is strictly dominated by Strategy 2. Therefore, Strategy 3 is removed from further analysis as it would never be a cost-effective choice.\n\nNo other pairs exhibit strict dominance. The remaining strategies are Strategy 1 and Strategy 2. With only two strategies, the concept of weak (extended) dominance does not apply, as it requires an intermediate option.\n\n3) Incremental Analysis of the Non-Dominated Set\n\nThe non-dominated set, which constitutes the cost-effectiveness frontier, consists of Strategy 1 and Strategy 2.\nStrategy 1: $(E_1, C_1) = (1.00, \\$9,000)$\nStrategy 2: $(E_2, C_2) = (1.10, \\$12,000)$\n\nTo determine the incremental cost per incremental QALY, we calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) for moving from the less effective/less costly strategy (Strategy 1) to the more effective/more costly strategy (Strategy 2).\n\nThe formula for the ICER is:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{E_2 - E_1} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$12,000 - \\$9,000}{1.10 - 1.00} $$\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\$3,000}{0.10 \\text{ QALYs}} $$\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\$30,000 \\text{ per QALY} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $30,000$. To express this unambiguously with $3$ significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $3.00 \\times 10^4$. This single ICER value represents the incremental cost per incremental QALY for the entire cost-effectiveness frontier beyond the baseline strategy.",
