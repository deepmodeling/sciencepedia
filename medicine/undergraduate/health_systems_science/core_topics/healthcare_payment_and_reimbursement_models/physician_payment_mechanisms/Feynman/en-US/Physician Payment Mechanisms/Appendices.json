This practice provides a foundational exercise in applying the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) formula, which is central to many fee-for-service systems. You will combine the three key components of a service's value—physician work ($RVU_w$), practice expense ($RVU_{pe}$), and malpractice insurance ($RVU_{mp}$)—and apply the necessary geographic adjustments and conversion factor to determine the final payment amount .",

            "problem": "A physician service is paid under the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS), which decomposes payment into three components: physician work, practice expense, and malpractice. For each component, a national relative value unit is adjusted by a component-specific Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI). A single national conversion factor (CF) then converts adjusted relative value units into dollars, and the total payment equals the sum across the three components. You are given the following values for a specific Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in a specified locality: physician work relative value units $RVU_{w}=2.0$, practice expense relative value units $RVU_{pe}=1.5$, malpractice relative value units $RVU_{mp}=0.2$, physician work GPCI $GPCI_{w}=1.05$, practice expense GPCI $GPCI_{pe}=0.98$, malpractice GPCI $GPCI_{mp}=1.02$, and a conversion factor equal to $36$ dollars per relative value unit. Using only the standard RBRVS aggregation of these components, compute the total payment for this service in dollars.

            "problem": "A physician payment for a single procedure under the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) within the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) is constructed from three components: work relative value units, practice expense relative value units, and malpractice relative value units. Each component is adjusted for local input prices using the Geographic Practice Cost Index (GPCI). The adjusted sum is then converted to dollars using a single national conversion factor. The fundamental base you may assume is: (i) RBRVS decomposes payment into component-specific relative value units, and (ii) each component’s relative value units are scaled by a locality-specific geographic multiplier prior to conversion into U.S. dollars.\n\nConsider a single procedure characterized by component relative value units $RVU_{w} = 3.1$, $RVU_{pe} = 1.6$, and $RVU_{mp} = 0.25$. The national conversion factor is $CF = 33.50$ (U.S. dollars per relative value unit). For Locality A, the geographic multipliers are $G_{w}^{A} = 1.08$, $G_{pe}^{A} = 1.23$, and $G_{mp}^{A} = 0.95$. For Locality B, the geographic multipliers are $G_{w}^{B} = 0.92$, $G_{pe}^{B} = 0.80$, and $G_{mp}^{B} = 1.10$. Ignore budget-neutrality adjustments, sequestration, modifiers, multiple-procedure rules, and site-of-service differentials; focus only on the geographic adjustment effect.\n\nUsing the component-wise geographic adjustment implied by the above fundamentals, derive the locality-specific payments and compute the net dollar change in payment when moving from Locality A to Locality B, defined as the Locality B payment minus the Locality A payment.
