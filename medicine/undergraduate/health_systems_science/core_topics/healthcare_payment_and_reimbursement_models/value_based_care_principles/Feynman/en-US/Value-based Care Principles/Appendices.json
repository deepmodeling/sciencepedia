            "problem": "A community primary care clinic is implementing Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) to support value-based care decisions. The clinic aggregates all monthly resource costs tied to delivering care, including clinician compensation, care team support, space and utilities, supplies, and information technology, and reports a total of $\\$300{,}000$ per month. The operations team estimates a monthly practical capacity of $15{,}000$ minutes of direct patient care time, reflecting scheduled time net of unavoidable non-patient time such as meetings, training, and unavoidable downtime. A standard chronic disease management visit is designed to consume $20$ minutes of direct patient care time under the clinic’s current process design. Starting from core definitions of TDABC and practical capacity in health systems science, derive the capacity cost rate as the cost per minute of practical capacity and use it to determine the TDABC visit cost for a $20$-minute chronic disease management encounter. Express the capacity cost rate in dollars per minute and the visit cost in dollars. Report exact values; do not round. Provide your final numerical results in the order: capacity cost rate, visit cost.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid, as it is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of management accounting as applied to health systems science, and well-posed. All data required for the solution are provided, and the terms are defined and used consistently.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key metrics within the Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) framework: the capacity cost rate and the cost of a specific clinical encounter.\n\nFirst, we define the capacity cost rate, denoted as $R_{capacity}$. This rate represents the cost of supplying one unit of time of a resource's practical capacity. It is calculated by dividing the total cost of the resources ($C_{total}$) by the practical capacity of those resources ($T_{practical}$). The formula is:\n$$\nR_{capacity} = \\frac{C_{total}}{T_{practical}}\n$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n- The total monthly resource costs, $C_{total} = \\$300,000$.\n- The monthly practical capacity of direct patient care time, $T_{practical} = 15,000$ minutes.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we can calculate the capacity cost rate:\n$$\nR_{capacity} = \\frac{\\$300,000}{15,000 \\text{ minutes}} = \\$20 \\text{ per minute}\n$$\nTherefore, the capacity cost rate for the clinic is $20$ dollars per minute of direct patient care time.\n\nNext, we must determine the TDABC cost for a standard chronic disease management visit. The core principle of TDABC is that the cost of an activity (in this case, a patient visit) is the product of the time required to perform the activity and the capacity cost rate. Let $T_{visit}$ be the time consumed by the visit and $C_{visit}$ be the cost of the visit. The formula is:\n$$\nC_{visit} = T_{visit} \\times R_{capacity}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that a standard chronic disease management visit consumes $20$ minutes of direct patient care time. Thus, we have:\n- Time for the chronic disease management visit, $T_{visit} = 20$ minutes.\n\nUsing the previously calculated capacity cost rate, $R_{capacity} = \\$20$ per minute, we can compute the cost of the visit:\n$$\nC_{visit} = 20 \\text{ minutes} \\times \\$20 \\text{ per minute} = \\$400\n$$\nThe TDABC cost for a single $20$-minute chronic disease management encounter is therefore $400$ dollars.\n\nThe problem asks for two results in a specific order: the capacity cost rate (in dollars per minute) and the visit cost (in dollars). The calculated values are $20$ and $400$, respectively.",

This exercise introduces the core tools of cost-effectiveness analysis, guiding you to calculate the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) .

            "problem": "A regional integrated delivery system is evaluating whether to adopt a new chronic heart failure management program relative to usual care. Under value-based care, the system uses a societal willingness-to-pay threshold per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) to make adoption decisions. Let the incremental health benefit be $\\Delta \\text{QALY} = 0.2$ and the incremental cost be $\\Delta C = 15{,}000$ in U.S. dollars (USD). Let the societal willingness-to-pay threshold be $\\lambda = 100{,}000$ USD per QALY. Starting from first principles that a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) represents health outcomes weighting life-years by health-related quality, and that value-based adoption compares monetized health gains to monetary costs using a threshold $\\lambda$, derive the working expressions for the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), compute their values for this intervention, and determine the adoption decision under a threshold rule.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of two key metrics in cost-effectiveness analysis, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) and the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), to determine an adoption decision for a new health program. The decision is framed under value-based care principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. The core principle is to evaluate whether the additional health benefit gained from a new intervention is worth its additional cost.\n\nThe Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost of an intervention ($\\Delta C$) to its incremental health benefit or effectiveness ($\\Delta E$). In this context, the health benefit is measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), so $\\Delta E = \\Delta \\text{QALY}$. The working expression for the ICER is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta \\text{QALY}}\n$$\nThis ratio represents the additional cost incurred to gain one additional QALY.\n\nThe given values are an incremental cost of $\\Delta C = 15{,}000$ U.S. dollars (USD) and an incremental health benefit of $\\Delta \\text{QALY} = 0.2$. Substituting these values into the expression for ICER, we compute its value:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{15{,}000}{0.2} = 75{,}000\n$$\nThe units of the ICER are USD per QALY. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures, which is represented as $7.500 \\times 10^{4}$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The adoption decision is made by comparing the ICER to a societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, which represents the maximum amount society is willing to pay for one additional QALY. The intervention is considered cost-effective and should be adopted if its ICER is less than or equal to this threshold:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} \\le \\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of ICER into this inequality gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta \\text{QALY}} \\le \\lambda\n$$\nAssuming the incremental health benefit is positive ($\\Delta \\text{QALY} > 0$), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta \\text{QALY}$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\le \\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY}\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to bring all terms to one side yields the decision rule in terms of NMB:\n$$\n(\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY}) - \\Delta C \\ge 0\n$$\nThe expression on the left-hand side is defined as the Net Monetary Benefit. It represents the net value of the intervention in monetary terms, by converting the health gain into a monetary value using the threshold $\\lambda$ and then subtracting the cost. The working expression is:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\lambda \\times \\Delta \\text{QALY}) - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe adoption rule is to adopt the intervention if $\\text{NMB} \\ge 0$. This rule is mathematically equivalent to the ICER-based rule.\n\nWe are given the willingness-to-pay threshold $\\lambda = 100{,}000$ USD per QALY. We can now compute the value of the NMB:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (100{,}000 \\times 0.2) - 15{,}000 = 20{,}000 - 15{,}000 = 5{,}000\n$$\nThe units of the NMB are USD. The problem requires rounding to four significant figures, which is represented as $5.000 \\times 10^{3}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the adoption decision, represented by the indicator $d$. Since $\\text{NMB} = 5{,}000$, which is greater than or equal to $0$, the intervention should be adopted. Equivalently, using the ICER, since $\\text{ICER} = 75{,}000$ USD per QALY, which is less than the threshold $\\lambda = 100{,}000$ USD per QALY, the intervention should be adopted. Therefore, the decision indicator is $d = 1$.\n\nThe final calculated values are $\\text{ICER} = 7.500 \\times 10^{4}$ USD per QALY, $\\text{NMB} = 5.000 \\times 10^{3}$ USD, and the decision indicator $d = 1$.",

This hands-on practice simulates a real-world scenario where a provider's payment is tied to both cost efficiency and quality outcomes for an entire episode of care .

            "id": "4404021",
            "problem": "A health system participates in a bundled payment program for elective lower-extremity joint replacement. Under value-based care, reconciliation payments must reflect both cost performance relative to a pre-set target and a quality-dependent modifier. The payer uses the following rules, consistent with the principle that payment incentives reward lower costs and higher quality:\n\n1. The bundle target price per episode is set equal to the three-year volume-weighted historical average per-episode cost, reduced by $0.03$ of that average.\n\n2. The reconciliation payment for a performance year is defined as the sum over episodes of the difference between the quality-adjusted target price per episode and the actual episode cost. A positive reconciliation payment denotes funds from payer to provider; a negative value denotes a provider repayment.\n\n3. Quality adjustment is based on a Composite Quality Score (CQS) on a $0$ to $100$ scale. The CQS is normalized to $q \\in [0,1]$ via division by $100$, and the reconciliation is multiplied by a quality multiplier equal to $0.9 + 0.2 q$.\n\nHistorical data:\n- Year $1$: $96$ episodes with a mean cost of $\\$23{,}700$ per episode.\n- Year $2$: $104$ episodes with a mean cost of $\\$24{,}100$ per episode.\n- Year $3$: $100$ episodes with a mean cost of $\\$23{,}900$ per episode.\n\nPerformance year data:\n- $40$ episodes cost $\\$22{,}500$ each,\n- $50$ episodes cost $\\$23{,}700$ each,\n- $30$ episodes cost $\\$24{,}800$ each.\n\nThe Composite Quality Score is $82$.\n\nUsing only these rules and data, compute the net reconciliation payment.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a net reconciliation payment for a health system under a value-based bundled payment program. The calculation must strictly follow the provided rules and data.\n\nFirst, we must establish a clear interpretation of the rules governing the calculation. The reconciliation payment depends on a target price, actual costs, and a quality score. There is a potential ambiguity between Rule 2, which mentions a \"quality-adjusted target price,\" and Rule 3, which states that \"the reconciliation is multiplied by a quality multiplier.\" Let the non-quality-adjusted target price be $T$, the actual cost for episode $i$ be $C_{actual,i}$, the number of episodes in the performance year be $N_{perf}$, and the quality multiplier be $M_q$. The gross savings or loss, before quality adjustment, is $S_{gross} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{perf}} (T - C_{actual,i}) = N_{perf}T - \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{perf}} C_{actual,i}$.\n\nTwo interpretations are possible:\n1. The quality multiplier is applied to the gross savings/loss: $R = S_{gross} \\times M_q$.\n2. The quality multiplier is applied directly to the target price: $R = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{perf}} (T \\times M_q - C_{actual,i}) = N_{perf} T M_q - \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{perf}} C_{actual,i}$.\n\nThe problem states that \"payment incentives reward lower costs and higher quality.\" In the second interpretation, a high-quality score could lead to a large positive payment even if costs significantly exceed the target, which weakens the incentive to control costs. The first interpretation, however, makes the provider accountable for both cost and quality simultaneously. If there are savings ($S_{gross} > 0$), high quality amplifies the reward. If there are losses ($S_{gross} < 0$), high quality can amplify the penalty. This aligns more strongly with the stated principles. Therefore, we will proceed with the first interpretation, where the statement in Rule 3 is taken as the direct operational instruction.\n\nThe calculation proceeds in several steps:\n\n1.  **Calculate the volume-weighted historical average cost ($C_{hist}$).**\n    The historical data spans three years:\n    -   Year 1: $N_1 = 96$ episodes, mean cost $C_1 = \\$23,700$.\n    -   Year 2: $N_2 = 104$ episodes, mean cost $C_2 = \\$24,100$.\n    -   Year 3: $N_3 = 100$ episodes, mean cost $C_3 = \\$23,900$.\n\n    The total number of historical episodes is $N_{hist} = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 96 + 104 + 100 = 300$.\n    The total historical cost is $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} N_j C_j = 96 \\times 23700 + 104 \\times 24100 + 100 \\times 23900 = 2275200 + 2506400 + 2390000 = \\$7,171,600$.\n    The volume-weighted historical average cost is:\n    $$C_{hist} = \\frac{\\sum N_j C_j}{\\sum N_j} = \\frac{7171600}{300} \\approx \\$23905.33$$\n\n2.  **Calculate the bundle target price per episode ($T$).**\n    According to Rule 1, this price is the historical average cost reduced by $3\\%$.\n    $$T = C_{hist} \\times (1 - 0.03) = C_{hist} \\times 0.97$$\n    $$T = \\frac{7171600}{300} \\times 0.97 \\approx \\$23188.17$$\n\n3.  **Calculate the total actual cost for the performance year ($C_{total, perf}$).**\n    The performance year includes three groups of episodes:\n    -   Group 1: $n_1 = 40$ episodes at $c_1 = \\$22,500$ each.\n    -   Group 2: $n_2 = 50$ episodes at $c_2 = \\$23,700$ each.\n    -   Group 3: $n_3 = 30$ episodes at $c_3 = \\$24,800$ each.\n    The total number of episodes is $N_{perf} = n_1 + n_2 + n_3 = 40 + 50 + 30 = 120$.\n    The total actual cost is:\n    $$C_{total, perf} = n_1 c_1 + n_2 c_2 + n_3 c_3 = 40 \\times 22500 + 50 \\times 23700 + 30 \\times 24800$$\n    $$C_{total, perf} = 900000 + 1185000 + 744000 = \\$2,829,000$$\n\n4.  **Calculate the gross savings/loss ($S_{gross}$).**\n    This is the difference between the total target spending and the total actual spending.\n    $$S_{gross} = N_{perf} \\times T - C_{total, perf}$$\n    $$S_{gross} = 120 \\times \\left(\\frac{7171600}{300} \\times 0.97\\right) - 2829000$$\n    $$S_{gross} = 0.4 \\times 7171600 \\times 0.97 - 2829000 = 2782580.8 - 2829000 = -\\$46419.20$$\n    The result is a gross loss for the provider.\n\n5.  **Calculate the quality multiplier ($M_q$).**\n    The Composite Quality Score is $CQS = 82$. This is normalized to $q = \\frac{CQS}{100} = \\frac{82}{100} = 0.82$.\n    The quality multiplier is given by the formula in Rule 3:\n    $$M_q = 0.9 + 0.2 q = 0.9 + 0.2 \\times 0.82 = 0.9 + 0.164 = 1.064$$\n\n6.  **Calculate the net reconciliation payment ($R$).**\n    Using our chosen interpretation, we multiply the gross loss by the quality multiplier.\n    $$R = S_{gross} \\times M_q = -46419.20 \\times 1.064 = -\\$49390.0288$$\n    The negative sign indicates a repayment from the provider to the payer.\n\n7.  **Final Answer and Rounding.**\n    The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n    The calculated value is $-\\$49390.0288$. The first four significant figures are $4$, $9$, $3$, and $9$. The fifth digit is $0$, so we round down (in magnitude).\n    $$R \\approx -\\$49390$$",
