            "problem": "A regional health plan’s utilization management committee is evaluating a prior authorization request for a new home-based cardiac monitoring device. From the payer perspective, the device has an incremental cost of $\\$5{,}000$ relative to standard care and confers an expected incremental benefit of $0.06$ Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), where Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a standard measure of health benefit that weights life-years by health-related quality of life. The plan’s value-based coverage policy uses a willingness-to-pay threshold of $\\$100{,}000$ per QALY to align prior authorization approvals with cost-effectiveness.\n\nUsing only core definitions from cost-effectiveness analysis, derive the decision rule that links a willingness-to-pay threshold to an approval decision for prior authorization. Then compute the corresponding net monetary benefit at the stated threshold. Assume the incremental benefit is positive and that there are no additional downstream costs or savings beyond the stated incremental cost.\n\nReport your answer as the net monetary benefit in dollars. Use scientific notation and round your answer to three significant figures. Express the final value in dollars.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard, formalizable principles of cost-effectiveness analysis within health economics. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. We can therefore proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of a decision rule for prior authorization and the calculation of the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). Let us define the relevant quantities symbolically.\nLet $\\Delta C$ represent the incremental cost of the new intervention relative to standard care.\nLet $\\Delta E$ represent the incremental effectiveness, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).\nLet $\\lambda$ represent the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, expressed in dollars per QALY.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following values:\n$\\Delta C = \\$5,000$\n$\\Delta E = 0.06 \\text{ QALYs}$\n$\\lambda = \\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}$\n\nFirst, we derive the decision rule. The core metric in cost-effectiveness analysis is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental health benefit:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n$$\nA medical intervention is considered \"cost-effective\" and thus a candidate for approval if its ICER is less than or equal to the payer's willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$. This gives the decision rule for prior authorization:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} \\le \\lambda\n$$\nAn intervention should be approved if the cost per QALY gained does not exceed the maximum amount the plan is willing to pay for that QALY.\n\nNext, we compute the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB). The NMB is an alternative formulation of the decision rule that linearizes the relationship and expresses the value of an intervention in monetary terms. We can derive the NMB formula by rearranging the decision rule inequality. Given that the incremental benefit $\\Delta E$ is positive (as stated in the problem, $\\Delta E = 0.06 > 0$), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by $\\Delta E$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\Delta C \\le \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E\n$$\nRearranging this to bring all terms to one side yields:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C \\ge 0\n$$\nThe expression on the left-hand side is defined as the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB):\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = \\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E - \\Delta C\n$$\nThe decision rule can now be expressed in terms of NMB: the intervention is cost-effective and should be approved if $\\text{NMB} \\ge 0$. The NMB represents the value of the intervention in monetary units, after accounting for its cost. A positive NMB indicates that the monetary value of the health gain exceeds the intervention's cost.\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the NMB formula to compute its value:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = (\\$100,000 \\text{ per QALY}) \\cdot (0.06 \\text{ QALYs}) - \\$5,000\n$$\nFirst, calculate the monetized incremental benefit, $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E = 100,000 \\cdot 0.06 = \\$6,000\n$$\nNow, subtract the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$:\n$$\n\\text{NMB} = \\$6,000 - \\$5,000 = \\$1,000\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures. The value $1,000$ can be written as $1.00 \\times 10^3$ to express it with three significant figures.",

            "solution": "The solution is determined by a step-by-step application of the fundamental definitions provided.\n\n**Part 1: Total Annual Clinician Time on Prior Authorization**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total time spent on PA activities per clinic day, denoted as $T_{day}$.

To express $2500$ unambiguously with three significant figures, we use scientific notation: $2.50 \\times 10^3$.\n\n**Part 2: Estimated Annual Revenue Lost**\n\nThe annual revenue loss is an opportunity cost resulting from clinician time being diverted from billable visits to PA activities. First, we determine the amount of clinician time that displaces billable visits. This is given as a fraction $\\alpha$ of the total annual PA time. Let this displaced time be $T_{displaced}$.\n$$ T_{displaced} = \\alpha \\times T_{annual} $$\nUsing the total annual time in minutes for dimensional consistency with the time per visit:\n$$ T_{displaced} = 0.20 \\times 150,000 \\text{ min} = 30,000 \\text{ min} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of billable visits lost, $N_{lost}$, by dividing the displaced time by the average time required for a single billable visit, $T_{visit}$.\n$$ N_{lost} = \\frac{T_{displaced}}{T_{visit}} $$\n$$ N_{lost} = \\frac{30,000 \\text{ min}}{20 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{visit}}} = 1,500 \\text{ visits} $$\n\nFinally, the estimated annual revenue lost, $L_{revenue}$, is the product of the number of lost visits and the average net revenue per visit, $R_{visit}$.\n$$ L_{revenue} = N_{lost} \\times R_{visit} $$\n$$ L_{revenue} = 1,500 \\text{ visits} \\times 120 \\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{visit}} = 180,000 \\text{ dollars} $$\nThis result must also be reported to three significant figures.

In gold carding, clinicians with a sufficiently high prior authorization approval history can bypass prior authorization for applicable services, thereby reducing administrative burden and potentially improving timely access to indicated care. Construct a program that, given a fixed panel of clinicians and policy parameters, computes two outcome metrics relative to a baseline of no gold carding: administrative hours reduced and patient-days of delay avoided.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- For a clinician with approval probability $r$ applied independently across requests, the expected number of approved requests among $n$ requests is $r \\cdot n$ by the law of large numbers and linearity of expectation.\n- If each prior authorization submission consumes $t_{\\text{admin}}$ hours, the total administrative time over $n$ submissions is $t_{\\text{admin}} \\cdot n$.\n- If a prior authorization causes a fixed delay of $D$ days per approved request, the total expected delay across $n$ requests with approval probability $r$ is $D \\cdot r \\cdot n$.\n\nModel assumptions and definitions to implement:\n- There are $I$ clinicians indexed by $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,I\\}$, each with a historical approval rate $r_i \\in [0,1]$ and a request volume $V_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ for a fixed time window.\n- A fixed fraction $p_{\\text{PA}} \\in [0,1]$ of all requests require prior authorization in the baseline.\n- A clinician is eligible for gold carding if and only if $r_i \\ge T$ and $V_i \\ge V_{\\min}$, where $T \\in [0,1]$ is the approval-rate threshold and $V_{\\min} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is the minimum volume requirement.\n- Under gold carding, all prior authorizations are waived for eligible clinicians on the requests that would have required prior authorization in the baseline. Ineligible clinicians continue with prior authorization as in baseline.\n- Let $t_{\\text{admin}}$ be the administrative time per prior authorization submission in hours, and $D$ be the delay per approved prior authorization in days.\n\nOutcomes to compute for each policy parameter set:\n1.
