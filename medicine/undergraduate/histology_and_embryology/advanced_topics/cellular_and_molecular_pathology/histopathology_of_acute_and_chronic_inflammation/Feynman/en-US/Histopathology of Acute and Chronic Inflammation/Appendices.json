This exercise provides a foundational overview of the diagnostic workflow, demonstrating how different laboratory techniques—from the basic H&E stain to advanced molecular probes—are used in a complementary fashion. By working through classic clinical scenarios, you will learn to integrate information from multiple sources to move from a general observation of inflammation to a specific and actionable diagnosis .",

            "problem": "A hospital receives three biopsy specimens from unrelated patients. The clinical team requests histopathologic evaluation to determine both the type of inflammation (acute versus chronic, granulomatous versus non-granulomatous, immune complex–mediated versus cell-mediated) and the likely etiologies. The specimens are as follows: Case 1 is a skin punch biopsy from the edge of a rapidly enlarging ulcer with purulent exudate; Case 2 is a lung wedge biopsy containing a firm nodule with central necrosis and surrounding epithelioid histiocytes; Case 3 is a renal core biopsy from a patient with hematuria and proteinuria.\n\nYou must decide which statement best defines the complementary roles of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\\&E), special stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) in diagnosing the types of inflammation present and inferring their etiologies across such cases, starting from fundamental principles: dyes bind tissue components by charge and chemistry, antigen–antibody interactions provide specific molecular localization, and immune complexes can be visualized by labeled antibodies. Assume the laboratory has access to well-validated special stains (for example, Periodic Acid–Schiff (PAS), Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN), Grocott Methenamine Silver (GMS), Gram stain), standard IHC panels for inflammatory cell markers, and IF panels for immunoglobulins and complement.\n\nWhich option is most accurate?\n\nA. H\\&E establishes architecture, injury patterns, and the dominant inflammatory cell type, thereby distinguishing acute (neutrophil-rich) from chronic (mononuclear and granulomatous) inflammation; special stains chemically highlight organisms and specific tissue constituents (for example, PAS and GMS for fungal walls, ZN for acid-fast bacilli, Gram for bacteria) to implicate infectious etiologies; IHC uses specific antibodies to identify cell lineage and selected antigens in tissue (for example, CD3$^+$ T cells, CD20$^+$ B cells, CD68$^+$ macrophages, or pathogen antigens), refining the nature of chronic inflammation and its drivers; IF employs fluorescently labeled antibodies to localize immunoglobulins and complement within structures (for example, glomerular basement membranes), where the pattern of deposition (linear versus granular; mesangial versus capillary loop) distinguishes autoimmune and immune complex–mediated etiologies.\n\nB. H\\&E primarily detects immunoglobulin and complement deposition patterns, special stains are used to determine inflammatory cell lineage, IHC reliably identifies microbes in all tissues, and IF is best suited to counting neutrophils to classify acute inflammation.\n\nC. H\\&E can distinguish acute from chronic inflammation but cannot inform etiology; special stains apply only to fungi, not bacteria or mycobacteria; IHC has no role in inflammatory diagnosis; IF is limited to research and lacks clinical relevance in tissue biopsies.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a clear, scientifically grounded scenario in diagnostic histopathology, providing sufficient context and accurate foundational principles to evaluate the roles of key laboratory techniques. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, asking for an assessment of established medical science without ambiguity or factual error.\n\nThe task is to determine the most accurate description of the complementary roles of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\\&E), special stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) in the context of three representative clinical cases: Case 1 (acute, likely infectious inflammation), Case 2 (granulomatous inflammation), and Case 3 (likely immune-mediated renal disease). The evaluation must be grounded in the provided first principles: $1$) dye-tissue binding based on chemistry, $2$) specific molecular localization via antigen-antibody interactions, and $3$) visualization of immune complexes with labeled antibodies.\n\nLet us derive the role of each technique based on these principles.\n\n**1. Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\\&E) Staining**\nThis is the foundational stain in histopathology. Its mechanism relies on the first principle: dye binding by charge and chemistry. Hematoxylin is a basic dye that is positively charged and stains acidic, basophilic structures like cell nuclei (rich in nucleic acids) a purplish-blue. Eosin is an acidic dye that is negatively charged and stains basic, eosinophilic structures like cytoplasm and extracellular matrix proteins (e.g., collagen) various shades of pink and red.\n*   **Application:** By rendering cellular and architectural features visible, H\\&E is the primary tool for assessing:\n    *   **Tissue Architecture:** The overall organization of the tissue, and its disruption by an inflammatory or injurious process.\n    *   **Cellular Morphology:** The identity of the predominant inflammatory cells. A predominance of neutrophils, with their characteristic multi-lobed nuclei, defines **acute inflammation** (relevant to Case 1). A predominance of mononuclear cells—lymphocytes (small, round, dark nuclei) and plasma cells (eccentric nuclei, basophilic cytoplasm)—defines **chronic inflammation**. A specific subtype of chronic inflammation, **granulomatous inflammation**, is identified by the presence of organized collections of epithelioid histiocytes (macrophages with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm), as described in Case 2.\n    *   **Patterns of Injury:** Necrosis (cell death), fibrosis (scarring), and other tissue damage.\n\nIn summary, H\\&E provides the initial, fundamental classification of the inflammatory process based on morphology and architecture.\n\n**2. Special Stains**\nThese are a diverse group of chemical staining techniques that, like H\\&E, rely on specific chemical reactions but are designed to highlight particular substances or microorganisms not well-visualized on H\\&E.\n*   **Application:** They are crucial for identifying potential etiologic agents.\n    *   In Case 1 (purulent ulcer), a **Gram stain** could identify gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria as the cause of the acute inflammation.\n    *   In Case 2 (granuloma), a **Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN)** or other acid-fast stain is used to detect *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, a classic cause. A **Grocott Methenamine Silver (GMS)** or **Periodic Acid–Schiff (PAS)** stain would be used to highlight the carbohydrate-rich walls of fungi, another important cause of granulomatous disease.\n    *   In Case 3 (renal biopsy), a **PAS** stain is excellent for delineating the delicate glomerular and tubular basement membranes, allowing for subtle changes in thickness or structure to be assessed.\n\nIn summary, special stains are ancillary chemical tests used to detect specific etiologies (primarily microbes) or highlight specific structural components to refine the H\\&E diagnosis.\n\n**3. Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**\nIHC operates on the second principle: highly specific antigen-antibody interactions. An antibody directed against a specific target antigen is applied to the tissue section. This primary antibody is then visualized using a secondary antibody conjugated to an enzyme, which deposits a colored product at the antigen's location.\n*   **Application:**\n    *   **Cell Lineage Identification:** IHC provides a precise immunophenotype of inflammatory cells, which is superior to morphological assessment alone. For example, in a chronic infiltrate, IHC can distinguish T-lymphocytes (e.g., CD3$^+$ cells) from B-lymphocytes (e.g., CD20$^+$ cells) and macrophages (e.g., CD68$^+$ cells). This is critical for characterizing chronic and granulomatous inflammatory processes (relevant to Case 2) and for distinguishing reactive inflammation from lymphoma.\n    *   **Pathogen Detection:** IHC can be used to detect specific antigens from pathogens, such as viruses (e.g., CMV, HSV), that are not detectable by traditional special stains.\n\nIn summary, IHC adds a layer of molecular specificity, refining the classification of inflammation by identifying the precise cell types involved and, in some cases, directly detecting pathogen-specific antigens.\n\n**4. Immunofluorescence (IF)**\nIF also uses the principle of antigen-antibody binding but employs a fluorescent tag (fluorophore) instead of an enzyme. When excited by light of a specific wavelength, the fluorophore emits light, which is captured by a special microscope.\n*   **Application:** IF is exceptionally sensitive and is the gold standard for detecting and localizing deposited immunoglobulins (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM) and complement proteins (e.g., C3, C1q). This relates to the third principle regarding the visualization of immune complexes.\n    *   In Case 3 (renal biopsy), IF is indispensable. The **pattern** and **location** of deposition are diagnostic. A **linear** pattern of IgG along the glomerular basement membrane is pathognomonic for anti-GBM disease. A **granular** (\"lumpy-bumpy\") pattern of immunoglobulins and complement is the hallmark of immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis. The specific location (e.g., mesangial, subendothelial, subepithelial) and the type of immunoglobulin (e.g., IgA predominance in IgA nephropathy) precisely define the disease entity.\n\nIn summary, IF is a high-sensitivity technique essential for diagnosing diseases driven by humoral immunity and immune complex deposition, particularly in nephrology and dermatology.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. H\\&E establishes architecture, injury patterns, and the dominant inflammatory cell type, thereby distinguishing acute (neutrophil-rich) from chronic (mononuclear and granulomatous) inflammation; special stains chemically highlight organisms and specific tissue constituents (for example, PAS and GMS for fungal walls, ZN for acid-fast bacilli, Gram for bacteria) to implicate infectious etiologies; IHC uses specific antibodies to identify cell lineage and selected antigens in tissue (for example, CD3$^+$ T cells, CD20$^+$ B cells, CD68$^+$ macrophages, or pathogen antigens), refining the nature of chronic inflammation and its drivers; IF employs fluorescently labeled antibodies to localize immunoglobulins and complement within structures (for example, glomerular basement membranes), where the pattern of deposition (linear versus granular; mesangial versus capillary loop) distinguishes autoimmune and immune complex–mediated etiologies.**\n    This statement accurately and comprehensively describes the distinct yet complementary roles of all four techniques. Each part aligns perfectly with the principles-based derivation above. H\\&E provides the morphologic framework. Special stains search for chemical targets and microbes. IHC provides molecular-level cell identification. IF reveals patterns of immune deposition. This option is a precise summary of the modern diagnostic workflow in histopathology for inflammatory diseases.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. H\\&E primarily detects immunoglobulin and complement deposition patterns, special stains are used to determine inflammatory cell lineage, IHC reliably identifies microbes in all tissues, and IF is best suited to counting neutrophils to classify acute inflammation.**\n    This statement is incorrect on all counts. H\\&E shows morphology, while IF detects immunoglobulin deposition. Special stains detect chemical structures/organisms, while IHC determines cell lineage. IHC is not a universal tool for identifying all microbes; special stains are often used. IF is not used for counting neutrophils; H\\&E is used for that purpose.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. H\\&E can distinguish acute from chronic inflammation but cannot inform etiology; special stains apply only to fungi, not bacteria or mycobacteria; IHC has no role in inflammatory diagnosis; IF is limited to research and lacks clinical relevance in tissue biopsies.**\n    This statement is riddled with errors. H\\&E provides significant clues to etiology (e.g., granulomas suggest mycobacteria/fungi). Special stains are explicitly used for bacteria (Gram stain) and mycobacteria (ZN stain). IHC is vital for characterizing chronic inflammation. IF is a routine and critical clinical diagnostic tool, especially in nephrology and dermatology.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. H\\&E routinely identifies specific organisms without ancillary studies; special stains determine whether inflammation is acute or chronic by color alone; IHC quantitatively measures cytokine concentrations to assign etiologies; IF is obsolete in kidney pathology and adds no value to diagnosing immune-mediated disease.**\n    This statement is profoundly incorrect. H\\&E rarely identifies specific organisms reliably. The type of inflammation is determined by cell type on H\\&E, not by the color of special stains. Standard clinical IHC is a qualitative/semi-quantitative localization technique for proteins, not a quantitative assay for cytokines. IF is the cornerstone of modern diagnostic nephrology, not obsolete.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, option A is the only one that accurately portrays the synergistic roles of these essential histopathologic techniques.",

            "problem": "A pathologist receives four biopsy specimens from patients with suspected chronic inflammatory lesions. Routine hematoxylin and eosin sections of each specimen show granulomatous inflammation defined by aggregates of epithelioid macrophages, rimmed by lymphocytes, and variably containing multinucleated giant cells. The pathologist must classify the granulomas by etiology using a principle-based diagnostic approach that leverages special stains and polarized light, grounded in the following fundamental facts:\n\n- The defining feature of a granuloma is a localized collection of activated macrophages (epithelioid histiocytes) that form in response to persistent stimuli that the innate immune system cannot easily eradicate. Infectious etiologies typically include bacteria and fungi; noninfectious etiologies include foreign material and immune-mediated diseases such as sarcoidosis.\n- The Ziehl–Neelsen (ZN) stain for acid-fast organisms depends on the high lipid content and long-chain mycolic acids in cell walls that resist decolorization by acid alcohol; organisms that retain the primary stain appear as red rods against a blue background.\n- The Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) reaction oxidizes vicinal diols to aldehydes, which then react with Schiff reagent to yield a magenta product; this highlights polysaccharide-rich structures, including fungal cell walls.\n- Under polarized light, exogenous crystalline or fibrous materials (for example, talc, silica, and some suture fragments) display birefringence due to anisotropic refractive indices; endogenous tissue components within granulomas typically do not show discrete, sharply birefringent particles.\n\nEach specimen yields the following findings:\n\nCase 1: Granulomas exhibit central caseous necrosis. Ziehl–Neelsen stain reveals numerous slender, red, acid-fast bacilli. Periodic acid–Schiff stain is negative for organisms. No birefringent particles are detected under polarized light.\n\nCase 2: Granulomas lack definite necrosis and contain multinucleated giant cells. Periodic acid–Schiff stain shows magenta-stained, round-to-oval organisms with narrow-based budding. Ziehl–Neelsen stain is negative. No birefringent particles are seen under polarized light.\n\nCase 3: Granulomas are centered around material that appears refractile on routine sections. Ziehl–Neelsen and Periodic acid–Schiff stains are both negative for organisms. Under polarized light, numerous bright, needle-like birefringent particles are present within the cytoplasm of giant cells.\n\nCase 4: Granulomas are compact, well-formed, and noncaseating. Ziehl–Neelsen and Periodic acid–Schiff stains are negative. No birefringent particles are appreciated under polarized light. Occasional asteroid bodies and laminated Schaumann bodies are noted within giant cells.\n\nWhich option best reflects a principle-based diagnostic approach using Ziehl–Neelsen stain, Periodic acid–Schiff stain, and polarized light, and correctly classifies the etiologies of Cases $1$ through $4$ in order?\n\nA. Case $1$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $2$: Fungal infection; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Sarcoidosis.\n\nB. Case $1$: Fungal infection; Case $2$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $3$: Sarcoidosis; Case $4$: Foreign-body granuloma.\n\nC. Case $1$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $2$: Sarcoidosis; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Fungal infection.\n\nD. Case $1$: Nocardia infection; Case $2$: Fungal infection; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Tuberculoid leprosy.",
            "solution": "Begin from the core definitions and facts:\n\nGranulomatous inflammation arises when macrophages differentiate into epithelioid histiocytes and form organized aggregates, often accompanied by multinucleated giant cells. Infectious causes typically present with organisms detectable by special stains, whereas noninfectious causes lack organisms and may show characteristic ancillary features. The Ziehl–Neelsen stain identifies acid-fast organisms through retention of carbol fuchsin after acid-alcohol decolorization, a property conferred by mycolic acids in the cell wall; Mycobacterium species are prototypical acid-fast organisms. The Periodic acid–Schiff reaction labels polysaccharide-rich structures, including fungal cell walls, producing magenta coloration. Polarized light reveals birefringent exogenous materials because their anisotropic structure causes differential light refraction; foreign-body granulomas commonly incorporate such polarizable particulates within giant cells.\n\nApply these principles to each case:\n\nCase 1: The presence of central caseous necrosis and numerous slender red acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl–Neelsen stain strongly indicates Mycobacterium tuberculosis or related Mycobacterium species. The negative Periodic acid–Schiff result and lack of birefringent material further support an infectious bacterial (mycobacterial) etiology rather than fungal or foreign-material induced granulomas. Therefore, Case 1 is classified as a mycobacterial infection.\n\nCase 2: Noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells are nonspecific, but the Periodic acid–Schiff stain demonstrates magenta-stained budding yeast, which is characteristic of fungi due to their polysaccharide-rich cell walls. The Ziehl–Neelsen negativity rules out acid-fast bacteria, and the lack of birefringent particles argues against foreign-body reaction. Therefore, Case 2 is classified as a fungal infection.\n\nCase 3: Both Ziehl–Neelsen and Periodic acid–Schiff stains are negative, indicating no acid-fast bacteria or fungi detected. The presence of numerous bright, needle-like birefringent particles under polarized light within giant cells is the hallmark of exogenous material (for example talc or suture fragments) eliciting a foreign-body granulomatous reaction. Therefore, Case 3 is classified as a foreign-body granuloma.\n\nCase 4: Compact, well-formed, noncaseating granulomas with negative Ziehl–Neelsen and Periodic acid–Schiff stains and absence of birefringence exclude detectable mycobacterial or fungal organisms and foreign material. The identification of asteroid bodies and Schaumann bodies within giant cells are classic though nonspecific features associated with sarcoidosis. Therefore, Case 4 is most consistent with sarcoidosis, an immune-mediated granulomatous disease of unknown etiology.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Case $1$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $2$: Fungal infection; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Sarcoidosis. This exactly matches the classifications derived from the principle-based approach: acid-fast positivity with caseation indicates mycobacterial; Periodic acid–Schiff-positive budding yeast indicates fungal; birefringent particles indicate foreign-body; organism-negative, noncaseating granulomas with asteroid and Schaumann bodies indicate sarcoidosis. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Case $1$: Fungal infection; Case $2$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $3$: Sarcoidosis; Case $4$: Foreign-body granuloma. This inverts the interpretations: Case $1$ shows acid-fast bacilli, not fungi; Case $2$ shows fungi on Periodic acid–Schiff, not acid-fast bacteria; Case $3$ has birefringent particles, not sarcoidosis; Case $4$ lacks birefringent particles and organisms, and has features of sarcoidosis, not foreign-body reaction. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Case $1$: Mycobacterial infection; Case $2$: Sarcoidosis; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Fungal infection. Case $2$ is misclassified: Periodic acid–Schiff positivity with budding yeast indicates fungal infection, not sarcoidosis. Case $4$ is misclassified: there are no Periodic acid–Schiff-positive fungal elements, and features suggest sarcoidosis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Case $1$: Nocardia infection; Case $2$: Fungal infection; Case $3$: Foreign-body granuloma; Case $4$: Tuberculoid leprosy. Although Nocardia species can be variably acid-fast (due to shorter-chain mycolic acids), the strong Ziehl–Neelsen positivity with caseating necrosis is more characteristic of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, not Nocardia. Case $4$ is misclassified: tuberculoid leprosy would typically show acid-fast organisms on more sensitive stains (for example Fite), and the clinical-pathologic pattern here favors sarcoidosis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice that aligns with the principle-based diagnostic approach using Ziehl–Neelsen stain, Periodic acid–Schiff stain, and polarized light, and correctly classifies all four cases.",

            "problem": "A gastrointestinal mucosal biopsy shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. You must decide whether to sign it out as purely chronic inflammation or chronic active inflammation. Base your reasoning on the core histopathologic definitions of acute and chronic inflammation: acute inflammation is defined by rapid onset, vascular changes with exudation, and a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), whereas chronic inflammation is defined by mononuclear cell infiltrates, ongoing tissue destruction, and attempts at repair (angiogenesis and fibrosis). Consider that the biopsy may show mononuclear cells, neutrophils, stromal changes, and epithelial injury to varying degrees and in different compartments. Which option lists the minimal set of histologic criteria that most specifically supports a diagnosis of chronic active inflammation, distinguishing it from a purely chronic process in a biopsy with mixed cellular infiltrates?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It asks to identify the most specific histologic criteria for \"chronic active inflammation\" based on fundamental pathological definitions.\n\nThe diagnosis of \"chronic active inflammation\" requires the simultaneous presence of features of both chronic and acute inflammation.\n\n1.  **The \"Chronic\" Component:** Based on the provided definition, this is established by the presence of a mononuclear cell infiltrate (primarily lymphocytes and plasma cells, with or without macrophages) in the lamina propria, which is the underlying connective tissue. Evidence of tissue remodeling, such as stromal fibrosis (scarring) and angiogenesis (new blood vessel formation), further solidifies the chronic nature of the process.\n\n2.  **The \"Active\" Component:** The definition of acute inflammation centers on polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). Therefore, the \"active\" part of \"chronic active inflammation\" is signaled by neutrophilic activity. However, the mere presence of scattered neutrophils in a mixed infiltrate within the lamina propria is not specific enough. The most definitive and specific indicator of ongoing, acute epithelial injury is the **location** of these neutrophils. Active inflammation is best demonstrated by neutrophils directly infiltrating and damaging the epithelium. This can manifest in several key ways:\n    *   **Neutrophilic Epitheliotropism:** Neutrophils migrating across the basement membrane and lodging within the epithelial layer itself (e.g., surface or glandular epithelium).\n    *   **Cryptitis:** Infiltration of glandular or crypt epithelium by neutrophils.\n    *   **Crypt Abscess:** An aggregation of neutrophils within the lumen of a gland or crypt, often leading to its destruction.\n\n3.  **Consequences of Activity:** Consequent tissue damage provides further evidence. This includes erosion (partial loss of the epithelial layer), ulceration (full-thickness defect of the mucosa), and the presence of a fibrinopurulent exudate (a meshwork of fibrin mixed with pus, i.e., abundant neutrophils and necrotic debris) on the surface.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of criteria for chronic active inflammation must include a chronic inflammatory background plus specific evidence of neutrophil-mediated epithelial injury.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Interstitial lymphocytes and plasma cells with scattered macrophages, stromal fibrosis and increased capillaries, absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils within epithelium or deep tissue, and no fibrinous exudate.** This option describes the features of chronic inflammation (mononuclear cells, fibrosis, angiogenesis) and explicitly states the *absence* of the key features of activity. This is the definition of a purely chronic, inactive process.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Background mononuclear infiltrates and fibrosis together with polymorphonuclear neutrophils infiltrating epithelium or glands forming microabscesses, surface erosion or ulceration, and a fibrinopurulent exudate indicating ongoing acute injury.** This option perfectly aligns with our derived principles. It establishes the \"chronic\" background (mononuclear infiltrates and fibrosis) and then lists the most specific and definitive hallmarks of the \"active\" component: neutrophils infiltrating epithelium, forming microabscesses, and resultant tissue destruction (erosion, ulceration, fibrinopurulent exudate).\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **C. Eosinophil-predominant infiltrates with mast cells and interstitial edema, intact surface epithelium, and no polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the tissue.** This describes a different type of inflammation (e.g., allergic or parasitic), which is characterized by eosinophils. The problem defines activity based on neutrophils. The intact epithelium also argues against active injury.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Well-formed noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells, stromal fibrosis, sparse neutrophils limited to luminal contents only, and an intact epithelial surface without erosion.** This option describes granulomatous inflammation, a subtype of chronic inflammation. The crucial disqualifier is that the neutrophils are \"limited to luminal contents only.\" Neutrophils in the lumen (e.g., in mucus) are not invading the tissue and are therefore not a sign of active mucosal inflammation. The intact epithelium further argues against activity.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Marked vascular congestion and perivascular lymphocytes with a thin layer of neutrophils admixed in luminal mucus, intact epithelium, and no fibrin deposition.** Similar to option D, the neutrophils are in the luminal mucus, not invading the tissue. This is a non-specific finding. The intact epithelium and absence of fibrin argue against significant acute injury.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
