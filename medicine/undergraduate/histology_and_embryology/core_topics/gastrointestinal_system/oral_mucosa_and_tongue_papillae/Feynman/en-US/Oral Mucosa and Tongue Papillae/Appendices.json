This exercise bridges the gap between qualitative histological observation and quantitative analysis by introducing the rete ridge index, a simple but effective metric for distinguishing between flexible lining mucosa and durable masticatory mucosa.

            "problem": "A histomorphometric analyst is tasked with classifying oral mucosal samples using structural metrics derived from stratified squamous epithelium and its interface with the underlying lamina propria. The oral mucosa comprises stratified squamous epithelium supported by a connective tissue lamina propria. In regions subjected to high mechanical loading (masticatory mucosa, such as gingiva and hard palate), the epithelium typically exhibits deeper epithelial downgrowths (rete ridges) into the lamina propria and more pronounced connective tissue papillae. In regions adapted for flexibility (lining mucosa, such as buccal and labial mucosa, soft palate, and floor of mouth), the epithelium is non-keratinized and the rete ridges are shallow or sparse. To quantify the interface morphology, define the rete ridge index as $$R = \\frac{d_{\\text{ridge}}}{t_{\\text{epithelium}}},$$ where $d_{\\text{ridge}}$ is the mean depth of rete ridges and $t_{\\text{epithelium}}$ is the mean total epithelial thickness, with both measured in micrometers. The goal is to use $R$ to classify an unknown sample as lining or masticatory mucosa by constructing a principled decision boundary between these two categories under the assumptions of equal prior probabilities and symmetric misclassification costs, and by adopting a simple, one-dimensional summary of the morphology via $R$.\n\nYou are provided with histomorphometric data (light microscopy, calibrated eyepiece reticle) for known reference samples and one unknown sample. Each listed value is a field-measured estimate in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. For each sample, compute the arithmetic mean of the listed $d_{\\text{ridge}}$ values to obtain $\\bar{d}$ and the arithmetic mean of the listed $t_{\\text{epithelium}}$ values to obtain $\\bar{t}$, then compute $R = \\bar{d}/\\bar{t}$ for that sample.\n\nKnown masticatory mucosa samples:\n- Sample $\\mathrm{M1}$: $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [180, 160, 200]$, $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [280, 260, 300]$.\n- Sample $\\mathrm{M2}$: $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [140, 150, 130]$, $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [240, 230, 250]$.\n\nKnown lining mucosa samples:\n- Sample $\\mathrm{L1}$: $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [40, 50, 35]$, $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [420, 390, 450]$.\n- Sample $\\mathrm{L2}$: $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [60, 55, 70]$, $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [350, 370, 340]$.\n\nUnknown sample:\n- Sample $\\mathrm{U}$: $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [110, 95, 105, 115]$, $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [280, 300, 290, 310]$.\n\nTasks:\n1. For each known sample, compute $\\bar{d}$, $\\bar{t}$, and $R$. Then compute the group mean indices for masticatory mucosa, $R_{\\mathrm{mast}}$, and for lining mucosa, $R_{\\mathrm{line}}$, by averaging the individual sample $R$ values within each group.\n2. Under the assumptions of equal prior probabilities, symmetric misclassification costs, and comparable within-group variability for the one-dimensional feature $R$, derive a decision boundary for classifying the unknown using these group mean indices. Justify the form of the boundary from first principles in statistical decision theory.\n3. Compute $\\bar{d}$, $\\bar{t}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ for the unknown sample $\\mathrm{U}$. Using the decision boundary, state whether the unknown is more consistent with lining or masticatory mucosa. Then, report the rete ridge index $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$.\n\nRound your reported rete ridge index for the unknown to four significant figures. Express $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ as a pure number (dimensionless), with no units in your final reported value.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the classification of an unknown oral mucosal sample based on a derived histomorphometric index, the rete ridge index $R$. The tasks involve calculating this index for known and unknown samples, deriving a decision rule based on statistical principles, and applying this rule to classify the unknown sample.\n\nThe first step is to compute the rete ridge index for each of the four known samples. The index $R$ is defined as the ratio of the mean rete ridge depth, $\\bar{d}$, to the mean total epithelial thickness, $\\bar{t}$.\n\nFor the known masticatory mucosa samples:\n\nSample $\\mathrm{M1}$: The provided data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [180, 160, 200]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [280, 260, 300]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{M1}} = \\frac{1}{3}(180 + 160 + 200) = \\frac{540}{3} = 180~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{M1}} = \\frac{1}{3}(280 + 260 + 300) = \\frac{840}{3} = 280~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index is $R_{\\mathrm{M1}} = \\frac{\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{M1}}}{\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{M1}}} = \\frac{180}{280} = \\frac{9}{14}$.\n\nSample $\\mathrm{M2}$: The provided data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [140, 150, 130]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [240, 230, 250]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{M2}} = \\frac{1}{3}(140 + 150 + 130) = \\frac{420}{3} = 140~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{M2}} = \\frac{1}{3}(240 + 230 + 250) = \\frac{720}{3} = 240~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index is $R_{\\mathrm{M2}} = \\frac{\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{M2}}}{\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{M2}}} = \\frac{140}{240} = \\frac{7}{12}$.\n\nFor the known lining mucosa samples:\n\nSample $\\mathrm{L1}$: The provided data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [40, 50, 35]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [420, 390, 450]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{L1}} = \\frac{1}{3}(40 + 50 + 35) = \\frac{125}{3}~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{L1}} = \\frac{1}{3}(420 + 390 + 450) = \\frac{1260}{3} = 420~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index is $R_{\\mathrm{L1}} = \\frac{125/3}{420} = \\frac{125}{1260} = \\frac{25}{252}$.\n\nSample $\\mathrm{L2}$: The provided data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [60, 55, 70]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [350, 370, 340]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{L2}} = \\frac{1}{3}(60 + 55 + 70) = \\frac{185}{3}~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{L2}} = \\frac{1}{3}(350 + 370 + 340) = \\frac{1060}{3}~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index is $R_{\\mathrm{L2}} = \\frac{185/3}{1060/3} = \\frac{185}{1060} = \\frac{37}{212}$.\n\nNext, we compute the group mean indices by averaging the individual sample $R$ values within each group.\nThe group mean for masticatory mucosa is $R_{\\mathrm{mast}} = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{\\mathrm{M1}} + R_{\\mathrm{M2}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{9}{14} + \\frac{7}{12}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{54+49}{84}\\right) = \\frac{103}{168}$.\nThe group mean for lining mucosa is $R_{\\mathrm{line}} = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{\\mathrm{L1}} + R_{\\mathrm{L2}}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{25}{252} + \\frac{37}{212}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1325 + 2331}{13356}\\right) = \\frac{3656}{26712} = \\frac{457}{3339}$.\n\nThe second task is to derive a decision boundary. Let the two classes be masticatory mucosa ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$) and lining mucosa ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}}$). The problem states we can assume equal prior probabilities ($P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) = P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$) and symmetric misclassification costs. Under these conditions, the Bayes optimal decision rule, which minimizes the average probability of error, is to assign an observation to the class with the maximum posterior probability. Given an observed index $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, we choose $\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ if $P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}) > P(\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}}|R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$.\nBy Bayes' theorem, $P(\\omega_i|R_{\\mathrm{obs}}) = p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_i)P(\\omega_i)/p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$. As the priors $P(\\omega_i)$ and the evidence $p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}})$ are common to both sides of the inequality, the rule simplifies to choosing the class with the maximum likelihood: choose $\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ if $p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) > p(R_{\\mathrm{obs}}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$.\nThe decision boundary, $R_{boundary}$, is the point where the likelihoods are equal: $p(R_{boundary}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{mast}}) = p(R_{boundary}|\\omega_{\\mathrm{line}})$.\nA principled choice for the form of the likelihoods, guided by the central limit theorem and the problem's hint of \"comparable within-group variability,\" is to model them as Gaussian distributions, $p(R|\\omega_i) = \\mathcal{N}(R; \\mu_i, \\sigma_i^2)$, with a common variance $\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{mast}}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{line}}^2$.\nThe equality of likelihoods becomes $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $(R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}})^2 = (R_{boundary}-\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}})^2$. The solution to this equation is the midpoint of the two means:\n$$R_{boundary} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{line}}}{2}$$\nWe use the calculated group mean indices as estimates for the true means, so $\\mu_{\\mathrm{mast}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{mast}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{line}} \\approx R_{\\mathrm{line}}$.\nThe decision boundary is $R_{boundary} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{mast}} + R_{\\mathrm{line}}}{2}$.\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$R_{boundary} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{103}{168} + \\frac{457}{3339}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{103 \\times 3339 + 457 \\times 168}{168 \\times 3339}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{343917 + 76776}{560952}\\right) = \\frac{420693}{1121904} = \\frac{20033}{53424}$.\nNumerically, $R_{boundary} \\approx 0.3750$.\n\nThe third task is to classify the unknown sample $\\mathrm{U}$. The data are $d_{\\text{ridge}} = [110, 95, 105, 115]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $t_{\\text{epithelium}} = [280, 300, 290, 310]~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean depth is $\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{4}(110 + 95 + 105 + 115) = \\frac{425}{4} = 106.25~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe mean thickness is $\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{4}(280 + 300 + 290 + 310) = \\frac{1180}{4} = 295~\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe rete ridge index for the unknown sample is $R_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{\\bar{d}_{\\mathrm{U}}}{\\bar{t}_{\\mathrm{U}}} = \\frac{106.25}{295} = \\frac{425}{1180} = \\frac{85}{236}$.\nNumerically, $R_{\\mathrm{U}} \\approx 0.360169$.\n\nTo classify the sample, we compare $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ with $R_{boundary}$.\n$R_{\\mathrm{U}} \\approx 0.3602$ and $R_{boundary} \\approx 0.3750$.\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{U}}  R_{boundary}$, the observed index falls into the region associated with lining mucosa. Therefore, the unknown sample $\\mathrm{U}$ is more consistent with lining mucosa.\nThe problem asks for the reported value of $R_{\\mathrm{U}}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$R_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{85}{236} \\approx 0.36016949$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3602$.",

The measured profiles are:\n- $I_{13}(L_1)=0.12$, $I_{13}(L_2)=0.82$, $I_{13}(L_3)=0.68$\n- $I_{4}(L_1)=0.08$, $I_{4}(L_2)=0.76$, $I_{4}(L_3)=0.61$\n\nAssume the following foundational facts:\n- Intermediate filaments (IF) composed of keratin subunits are major contributors to epithelial mechanical integrity, with specific keratin isoform pairs marking differentiation states. In oral mucosa, basal cells typically express keratin (KRT) $5$/$14$ pairs, non-keratinized suprabasal cells characteristically express keratin (KRT) $4$/$13$, and keratinized masticatory suprabasal cells characteristically express keratin (KRT) $1$/$10$ and cross-linked cornified envelope proteins.\n- The presence of a cornified layer (stratum corneum) and cross-linking of the keratin network correlates with increased abrasion resistance and typically increases surface friction under low hydration, while non-keratinized epithelium retains viable superficial cells, remains highly hydrated by saliva, and shows lower abrasion resistance and a reduced coefficient of friction under physiological conditions.\n\nUsing only the intensity profiles above and the foundational facts, infer the most likely mucosal type represented by the section and predict the expected functional properties related to friction and abrasion resistance. Choose the single best option.\n\nA.

The provided data show low normalized intensities for both KRT 13 and KRT 4 in the basal layer ($L_1$), which is consistent with the foundational fact that basal cells of oral mucosa typically express the KRT 5/14 pair. The intensities for both KRT 13 and KRT 4 are markedly elevated in the suprabasal ($L_2$) and superficial ($L_3$) layers. According to the foundational facts, the KRT 4/13 pair is the characteristic marker for non-keratinized suprabasal cells. The strong expression of both these keratins in the suprabasal and superficial compartments is the definitive diagnostic feature, ruling out a keratinized phenotype, which would express KRT 1/10. The problem reinforces this by noting that the superficial layers ($L_3$) are \"viable,\" which is inconsistent with a cornified layer of non-viable cells.\n\nSecond, we infer the functional properties. Having identified the tissue as non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, we apply the second foundational fact. This fact states that non-keratinized epithelium is characterized by lower abrasion resistance and a reduced coefficient of friction under physiological lubrication, due to high surface hydration. These properties suit tissues that require flexibility and distension, such as the lining of the cheeks (buccal mucosa) or the underside of the tongue (ventral tongue).\n\nBased on this analysis, the data unequivocally point to a non-keratinized lining mucosa with functional properties of low abrasion resistance and low friction, adapted for flexibility.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- Option A correctly identifies the tissue type as non-keratinized lining mucosa and correctly deduces the functional properties (reduced abrasion resistance, low friction, flexibility) that are direct consequences of this tissue type.\n- Option B is incorrect because the KRT 4/13 marker profile contradicts a classification of keratinized mucosa.\n- Option C is incorrect as it falsely claims the epithelium of circumvallate trench walls is \"predominantly keratinized\"; in reality, it is non-keratinized to allow access to taste buds.\n- Option D is incorrect because the heavily keratinized filiform papillae would express keratinization markers (like KRT 1/10), not the observed KRT 4/13.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only choice consistent with the provided data and foundational principles.",
