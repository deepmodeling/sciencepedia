            "introduction": "A cornerstone of histology and physiology is the principle that structure dictates function. This exercise challenges you to apply this principle to the major salivary glands by explaining why a specific histological feature—the prominent striated ducts of the submandibular gland—is a direct consequence of its primary physiological role. By integrating several foundational facts about salivary secretion, you will practice the critical skill of linking microscopic anatomy to macroscopic function .",

            "problem": "A histology team compares sections from the major salivary glands and notes that the submandibular gland shows particularly prominent striated ducts: the duct epithelial cells are tall and exhibit conspicuous basal striations corresponding to deep basal infoldings filled with mitochondria. Using only general principles of epithelial transport and salivary physiology, choose the single best explanation that links this robust striated duct architecture to the functional role of the submandibular gland during resting conditions.\n\nYou may assume the following foundational facts without proof:\n- Primary acinar secretion is approximately isotonic with plasma and is subsequently modified by the ductal epithelium.\n- Striated duct cells carry out active transmembrane ion transport driven by adenosine triphosphate (ATP), notably reabsorbing sodium and chloride while secreting potassium and bicarbonate, and their basal membrane surface area is amplified by basal infoldings packed with mitochondria.\n- Salivary ducts are relatively water-impermeable compared to their ion permeability, so electrolyte transport can render the final saliva hypotonic.\n- Flow rate sets the time available for ductal modification: low flow allows more complete electrolyte reabsorption per unit volume; high flow leaves less time for modification.\n- In the unstimulated, resting state, the submandibular glands contribute the largest fraction of total salivary volume among the major glands.\n\nWhich option best accounts for why the submandibular gland exhibits the most robust striated duct system among the major salivary glands?\n\nA. Because the submandibular glands dominate unstimulated flow at low flow rates, they must sustain substantial active sodium and chloride reabsorption to produce hypotonic saliva at rest; this demand favors extensive basal membrane infoldings and abundant mitochondria in striated ducts to power adenosine triphosphate driven transport over prolonged transit times.\n\nB. Because mucous saliva requires extensive postsecretory glycoprotein processing, the striated ducts in submandibular glands expand their Golgi apparatus, creating basal striations primarily to support glycosylation rather than ion transport.\n\nC. Because sympathetic stimulation during feeding leads to sustained potassium secretion, the submandibular glands enlarge their striated ducts mainly to accommodate stimulated, high flow conditions with elevated protein output.\n\nD. Because submandibular acini secrete hypertonic primary saliva, the striated ducts must reabsorb large amounts of water to restore isotonicity, necessitating a particularly robust ductal epithelium optimized for transcellular water uptake.\n\nE. Because submandibular glands possess fewer secretory acini than parotid glands, they compensate by expanding their duct system to increase total saliva volume, even though ductal cells do not substantially modify ionic composition at rest.",
            "solution": "This problem requires connecting the prominent striated ducts of the submandibular gland to its primary function by synthesizing the provided facts about salivary physiology.\n\n1.  **Role of Striated Ducts:** The defining features of striated ducts (basal infoldings, mitochondria) are anatomical adaptations for high-capacity, energy-intensive active ion transport. Their primary job is to modify the primary isotonic saliva into a final hypotonic product by reabsorbing ions like $\\text{Na}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$.\n2.  **Function of Submandibular Gland at Rest:** The submandibular gland provides the majority of saliva in the unstimulated, resting state. This resting state is characterized by a low flow rate.\n3.  **Synthesis:** At a low flow rate, saliva spends a long time transiting the ducts, which allows for extensive modification. Because the submandibular gland is the main producer of resting saliva, its ducts must sustain this high level of ion reabsorption for prolonged periods. This continuous, energy-demanding work (powered by ATP) necessitates the robust anatomical features observed: an extensive membrane surface area for transport (infoldings) and a dense population of cellular power plants (mitochondria).\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Correct.** This option perfectly aligns with the synthesis above. It correctly links the gland's dominance in low-flow resting saliva production to the need for sustained, substantial active ion reabsorption, which in turn explains the highly developed striated duct architecture.\n*   **B. Incorrect.** The basal striations are caused by mitochondria and membrane infoldings for ion transport, not an expanded Golgi apparatus for glycoprotein processing. This contradicts fundamental cell biology.\n*   **C. Incorrect.** This option focuses on stimulated, high-flow conditions, whereas the question asks about the resting state, which is the submandibular gland's dominant functional niche.\n*   **D. Incorrect.** Primary saliva is isotonic, not hypertonic. Furthermore, ducts are relatively impermeable to water and primarily reabsorb ions, not water.\n*   **E. Incorrect.** Ducts do not produce significant volume; acini do. The claim that ducts do not substantially modify saliva at rest is the opposite of the truth; modification is most extensive at low flow rates (i.e., at rest).",

            "introduction": "Following the principle that striated ducts actively modify the composition of saliva, this next practice asks you to quantify the outcome of this process. The active reabsorption of ions in water-impermeable ducts results in a final saliva that is hypotonic compared to the initial plasma-like secretion from the acini. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to calculate the osmolarity of a saliva sample, making the abstract concept of hypotonicity a concrete, measurable value .",

            "problem": "In the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, sublingual), acinar cells produce a primary secretion that is approximately isotonic with plasma, and ductal epithelial cells subsequently modify the ionic content through selective reabsorption and secretion while being relatively impermeable to water.

At rest, the submandibular gland contributes the largest fraction of unstimulated flow, whereas during gustatory–mechanical stimulation, the parotid gland contribution increases due to its serous acinar architecture and high ductal throughput. Use the following representative, physiologically plausible values to quantify gland-specific flow rates and to compute a time-weighted mean total saliva output per minute, invoking only the definitions of flow rate as volume per unit time and additivity of independent sources.\n\nAssume the whole saliva flow rate at rest is $Q_{\\mathrm{rest}}^{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.30$ in milliliters per minute, with fractional contributions: parotid $0.20$, submandibular $0.70$, sublingual $0.10$.
