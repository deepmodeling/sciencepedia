Its curved anterior surface is responsible for the majority of the eye's total refractive power. This first practice challenges you to build a model of this powerful lens from the ground up, starting from Snell's law of refraction.

            "problem": "Anatomically, the anterior corneal surface is a smooth, nearly spherical interface between air and the corneal stroma. Consider an eye in which the anterior corneal surface is well-approximated by a spherical refracting surface of radius of curvature $r_a$ (vertex at the corneal apex, center of curvature located inside the cornea). A collimated paraxial beam in air is incident on this surface and refracts into the corneal tissue. Take light to propagate from left (air) to right (cornea). Use the following fundamental base only: Snell’s law $n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$, the paraxial (small-angle) approximation $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$, and the geometry of a spherical refracting surface in the Gaussian (paraxial) approximation.\n\nAdopt the standard sign convention for spherical refracting surfaces: distances measured along the optical axis are positive to the right (the direction of light propagation), and the radius $r_a$ is positive when the center of curvature lies to the right of the surface (inside the cornea for an anterior convex cornea). Define the surface refracting power $F$ as the optical power of this single refracting surface under paraxial conditions.\n\nStarting from the stated fundamentals (and no additional formulas), derive an expression for $F$ in terms of the refractive indices of air $n_{\\text{air}}$, cornea $n_{\\text{cornea}}$, and the anterior radius $r_a$. Then evaluate $F$ numerically for\n- $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.0003$,\n- $n_{\\text{cornea}} = 1.376$,\n- $r_a = 7.80\\,\\text{mm}$.\n\nExpress your numerical answer in diopters ($\\text{m}^{-1}$) and round to four significant figures. The final answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the refracting power of a single spherical surface from fundamental principles and its subsequent numerical evaluation. The fundamental principles are stated as Snell's law, the paraxial approximation, and the geometry of a spherical surface.\n\nLet us model the anterior corneal surface as a single spherical interface separating two media with refractive indices $n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$ and $n_2 = n_{\\text{cornea}}$. The surface has a radius of curvature $r_a$. Let the optical axis be the axis of symmetry of the surface. Light propagates from left to right. The vertex of the surface, where it intersects the optical axis, is denoted by $V$. The center of curvature is at $C$, a distance $r_a$ to the right of $V$. According to the specified sign convention, $r_a$ is positive.\n\nConsider a paraxial ray of light, initially in air, parallel to the optical axis at a height $h$ from it. This ray represents part of a collimated beam. The ray strikes the surface at a point $P$. At point $P$, the ray is refracted into the cornea. The line normal to the surface at $P$ is the line that passes through $P$ and the center of curvature $C$.\n\nLet $\\theta_1$ be the angle of incidence and $\\theta_2$ be the angle of refraction. These are the angles between the ray and the normal at $P$. Snell's law states:\n$$n_1 \\sin \\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin \\theta_2$$\nFor paraxial rays, the angles are small, so we use the small-angle approximation $\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta$. Snell's law becomes:\n$$n_1 \\theta_1 = n_2 \\theta_2$$\nSubstituting $n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$ and $n_2 = n_{\\text{cornea}}$, we have:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} \\theta_1 = n_{\\text{cornea}} \\theta_2$$\nNow, we must express $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in terms of the geometric parameters of the system. Let $\\alpha$ be the angle that the normal line $PC$ makes with the optical axis. Since the incident ray is parallel to the optical axis, the angle of incidence is equal to $\\alpha$. Thus, $\\theta_1 = \\alpha$.\n\nAfter refraction, the ray bends towards the optical axis and intersects it at the secondary focal point, $F_2$. The distance from the vertex $V$ to this point is the secondary focal length, $f_2$. Let $\\phi'$ be the angle that the refracted ray makes with the optical axis.\n\nFrom the geometry of the triangle $\\triangle PCF_2$, the angle $\\alpha$ is an exterior angle. The interior opposite angles are $\\theta_2$ and $\\phi'$. Therefore, we have the relation:\n$$\\alpha = \\theta_2 + \\phi'$$\nwhich can be rearranged to find $\\theta_2$:\n$$\\theta_2 = \\alpha - \\phi'$$\nWe now have expressions for $\\theta_1$ and $\\theta_2$ in terms of geometric angles $\\alpha$ and $\\phi'$. We can substitute these into the paraxial form of Snell's law:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} (\\alpha) = n_{\\text{cornea}} (\\alpha - \\phi')$$\nIn the paraxial (or Gaussian) approximation, the height $h$ is small compared to $r_a$ and $f_2$. We can approximate the angles $\\alpha$ and $\\phi'$ using the tangent function, where the arc length from $V$ to $P$ is approximated by the height $h$:\n$$\\alpha \\approx \\tan \\alpha \\approx \\frac{h}{r_a}$$\n$$\\phi' \\approx \\tan \\phi' \\approx \\frac{h}{f_2}$$\nSubstituting these approximations into our equation:\n$$n_{\\text{air}} \\left(\\frac{h}{r_a}\\right) = n_{\\text{cornea}} \\left(\\frac{h}{r_a} - \\frac{h}{f_2}\\right)$$\nSince the height $h$ is arbitrary and non-zero for any off-axis ray, we can divide both sides by $h$:\n$$\\frac{n_{\\text{air}}}{r_a} = \\frac{n_{\\text{cornea}}}{r_a} - \\frac{n_{\\text{cornea}}}{f_2}$$\nThe problem defines the surface refracting power $F$ as the optical power of the surface. For a single refracting surface, the power is defined as the ratio of the refractive index of the image space to the secondary focal length, i.e., $F = n_2/f_2$. In this context, $F = n_{\\text{cornea}}/f_2$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this quantity:\n$$\\frac{n_{\\text{cornea}}}{f_2} = \\frac{n_{\\text{cornea}}}{r_a} - \\frac{n_{\\text{air}}}{r_a}$$\n$$F = \\frac{n_{\\text{cornea}} - n_{\\text{air}}}{r_a}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the refracting power $F$ of the anterior corneal surface.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n-   $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.0003$\n-   $n_{\\text{cornea}} = 1.376$\n-   $r_a = 7.80\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nThe unit of power, the diopter (D), is the reciprocal meter ($\\text{m}^{-1}$). Therefore, we must express the radius of curvature $r_a$ in meters:\n$$r_a = 7.80\\,\\text{mm} = 7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the derived formula for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{1.376 - 1.0003}{7.80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}}$$\n$$F = \\frac{0.3757}{0.00780}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$$\n$$F \\approx 48.1666... \\,\\text{D}$$\nThe problem instructs to round the numerical answer to four significant figures.\n$$F \\approx 48.17\\,\\text{D}$$",

In the pump–leak model of corneal hydration control, the endothelium generates a small hyperosmotic condition in the anterior chamber relative to the stroma, which drives net solvent transport from stroma to aqueous humor to oppose stromal swelling. Treat the endothelium as a homogeneous, planar membrane and adopt the following sign convention: a positive solvent flux $J_{w}$ is defined as directed from stroma to aqueous humor.

            "solution": "The transport of solvent across a semipermeable membrane under the influence of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure gradients is described by the principles of linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics. For a single membrane, the volume flux per unit area, $J_w$, is linearly proportional to the driving forces. The appropriate relation is a form of the Starling equation, derived from the Kedem-Katchalsky formalism:\n$$J_w = L_p (\\Delta P_{\\text{effective}})$$\nwhere $L_p$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the membrane and $\\Delta P_{\\text{effective}}$ is the net effective pressure difference across it.\n\nThe effective pressure is the sum of the hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P$, and the effective osmotic pressure difference. The osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi$, is generated by solutes, but only to the extent that they are reflected by the membrane. This is quantified by the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$. The effective osmotic pressure driving water flow is $-\\sigma \\Delta \\pi$. The negative sign is crucial: an osmotic pressure difference drives water from the region of lower osmotic pressure (lower solute concentration) to the region of higher osmotic pressure (higher solute concentration).\n\nLet us verify the sign convention. The flux $J_w$ is positive from stroma to aqueous humor. The pressure differences are defined as $\\Delta X = X_{\\text{stroma}} - X_{\\text{aqueous}}$.\n1.  A positive hydrostatic pressure difference, $\\Delta P > 0$ ($P_{\\text{stroma}} > P_{\\text{aqueous}}$), drives flow from stroma to aqueous. This corresponds to a positive flux. Thus, the hydrostatic term is $L_p \\Delta P$.\n2.  A positive osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\pi > 0$ ($\\pi_{\\text{stroma}} > \\pi_{\\text{aqueous}}$), means the stroma is hyperosmotic.
