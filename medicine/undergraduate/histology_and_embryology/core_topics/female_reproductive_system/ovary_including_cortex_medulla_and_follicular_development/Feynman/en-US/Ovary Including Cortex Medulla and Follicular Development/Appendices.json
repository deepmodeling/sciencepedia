After this peak, a substantial fraction is lost prenatally through apoptosis and atresia.

The given peak germ cell count of approximately $7$ million and the subsequent massive loss (atresia) leaving a much smaller number at birth are well-established facts in human ovarian development and histology. The statement that surviving germ cells are primary oocytes arrested in prophase I and organized into primordial follicles in the ovarian cortex is a cornerstone of reproductive biology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

Therefore, a reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the number of primordial follicles present at birth. According to the provided information, this number is equivalent to the number of germ cells that survive the prenatal attrition process.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{peak}}$ represent the peak germ cell count at mid-gestation.\n$$N_{\\text{peak}} = 7 \\times 10^{6}$$\nLet $f_{\\text{attrition}}$ be the fraction of the germ cell pool lost due to apoptosis and atresia between the mid-gestational peak and birth.\n$$f_{\\text{attrition}} = 0.70$$\nThe number of germ cells lost, $N_{\\text{lost}}$, can be calculated as the attrition fraction multiplied by the peak number of cells.\n$$N_{\\text{lost}} = f_{\\text{attrition}} \\times N_{\\text{peak}}$$\nThe number of surviving germ cells at birth, $N_{\\text{birth}}$, is the initial peak count minus the number of cells lost. The expression is:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}} - N_{\\text{lost}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\text{lost}}$, we get:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}} - (f_{\\text{attrition}} \\times N_{\\text{peak}})$$\nThis can be factored to derive a more direct expression for the number of surviving cells:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = N_{\\text{peak}}(1 - f_{\\text{attrition}})$$\nThe problem states that at birth, all surviving germ cells are accounted for as primordial follicles. Therefore, the number of primordial follicles is equal to $N_{\\text{birth}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value by substituting the given data into the derived expression.\n$$f_{\\text{attrition}} = 0.70$$\nThe fraction of surviving cells is $(1 - f_{\\text{attrition}})$.\n$$1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\nThe number of primordial follicles at birth is $30\\%$ of the peak germ cell count.\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = (7 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.30)$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$N_{\\text{birth}} = 2.1 \\times 10^{6}$$\nThus, the expected number of primordial follicles present at birth is $2,100,000$.",

            "problem": "A human ovarian follicle originates in the ovarian cortex, where primordial follicles dwell within relatively avascular stromal tissue. As the follicle transitions through primary and secondary (preantral) stages, it remains in the cortex and grows slowly. With the onset of the antral stage, vascular support from the medulla becomes functionally critical via increased perfusion through the thecal layers, and the follicle’s diameter increases more rapidly as the antral cavity expands.

The description of folliculogenesis, including the progression from primordial to preovulatory states, the anatomical context (cortex and medulla), and the role of vascularization, is accurate. The given numerical values for follicle diameters ($30\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ for primordial, $2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for early antral, $20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for preovulatory) and phase durations ($120\\,\\mathrm{days}$ for preantral, $10\\,\\mathrm{days}$ for antral) are scientifically plausible and fall within accepted ranges for a simplified model of the human menstrual cycle.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The objective is to calculate a single, well-defined quantity: the constant growth rate during the linear phase.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary data and constraints to solve for the requested quantity. There are no internal contradictions. The continuity constraint on $D(t)$ is consistent with the boundary conditions.\n- **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not metaphorical, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard mathematical modeling exercise applied to a biological process, which is a common practice in biophysics and quantitative biology. The use of an \"approximately linear\" segment is a valid and explicitly stated simplification.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe model is a piecewise function defined over two intervals.\n\n**1. Preantral Phase: $0 \\leq t \\leq T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$**\n\nThe growth in this phase is modeled as exponential:\n$$D(t) = A \\exp(kt)$$\nThe parameters $A$ and $k$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the start and end of this phase.\nAt $t=0$, we have $D(0) = D_0$.\n$$D(0) = A \\exp(k \\cdot 0) = A \\cdot 1 = A$$\nThus, $A = D_0$. The function becomes $D(t) = D_0 \\exp(kt)$.\n\nAt $t=T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$, we have $D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}$.\n$$D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = D_0 \\exp(k T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}$$\nSolving for the rate constant $k$:\n$$\\exp(k T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}}{D_0}$$\n$$k T_{\\mathrm{pre}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}}{D_0}\\right)$$\n$$k = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{pre}}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}}{D_0}\\right)$$\nThe function for the preantral phase is fully determined, although the value of $k$ is not required to answer the specific question posed.\n\n**2. Antral Phase: $T_{\\mathrm{pre}} \\leq t \\leq T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{an}}$**\n\nThe growth in this phase is modeled as \"approximately linear\". This implies a constant rate of growth. We can model the diameter using a linear function:\n$$D(t) = mt + c$$\nwhere the slope $m$ represents the constant growth rate in $\\mathrm{mm/day}$. This is the quantity we need to find.\n\nThe slope of a line is defined as the change in the vertical coordinate divided by the change in the horizontal coordinate, $m = \\frac{\\Delta D}{\\Delta t}$.\nThe time interval for this phase spans from $t_1 = T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ to $t_2 = T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{an}}$. The duration of this interval is:\n$$\\Delta t = t_2 - t_1 = (T_{\\mathrm{pre}} + T_{\\mathrm{an}}) - T_{\\mathrm{pre}} = T_{\\mathrm{an}}$$\nThe corresponding diameters are $D(t_1) = D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}) = D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}$ and $D(t_2) = D(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}+T_{\\mathrm{an}}) = D_{\\mathrm{preov}}$. The change in diameter over this interval is:\n$$\\Delta D = D(t_2) - D(t_1) = D_{\\mathrm{preov}} - D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}$$\nTherefore, the constant antral-phase growth rate $m$ is:\n$$m = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{preov}} - D_{\\mathrm{antral0}}}{T_{\\mathrm{an}}}$$\n\n**Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the expression for $m$. The units must be consistent. The required final unit is $\\mathrm{mm/day}$, so all diameters must be in $\\mathrm{mm}$ and time in $\\mathrm{days}$.\nThe given values are:\n- $D_{\\mathrm{preov}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{antral0}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{an}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{days}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$m = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{10\\,\\mathrm{days}} = \\frac{18\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{10\\,\\mathrm{days}}$$\n$$m = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $1.8$ with four significant figures, we write $1.800$.\n\nThe approximate constant antral-phase growth rate per day is $1.800\\,\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\nThe continuity of the overall function $D(t)$ at the transition point $t = T_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ is ensured by the boundary conditions, as both the exponential and linear pieces are constrained to pass through the point $(T_{\\mathrm{pre}}, D_{\\mathrm{antral0}})$.",

It is free from subjective claims or speculative science.\n\nBased on this assessment, the problem is deemed scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of follicles that survive to the antral stage from an initial recruited cohort. This can be modeled using probability theory.\n\nLet $R$ be the total number of recruited primordial follicles. We are given $R = 30$.\nLet $q$ be the probability of a single follicle undergoing atresia. This is given as the atresia fraction, so $q = 0.80$.\nLet $p$ be the probability of a single follicle surviving to the antral stage. The problem states that the survival probability is the complement of the atresia fraction. Therefore:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$$\nThe follicles are assumed to survive or undergo atresia independently of one another. We can define an indicator random variable, $X_i$, for each of the $R$ follicles, where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $30$.\nLet $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th follicle survives to the antral stage, and $X_i = 0$ if it undergoes atresia.\nThe probability distribution for each $X_i$ is a Bernoulli distribution:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p = 0.20$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = q = 0.80$$\nThe expected value of each indicator variable, $E[X_i]$, is calculated as:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot q = p$$\nSo, for each follicle, the expected value of survival is $E[X_i] = 0.20$.\n\nLet $S$ be the total number of follicles that reach the antral stage. $S$ is the sum of the individual indicator variables:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{R} X_i$$\nWe are asked to find the expected number of surviving follicles, which is the expected value of $S$, denoted $E[S]$.\nUsing the property of linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{R} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{R} E[X_i]$$\nSince each follicle has the same survival probability $p$, we have $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$.\n$$E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{R} p = R \\cdot p$$\nThis formula gives the expected number of successes in $R$ independent Bernoulli trials, which is the mean of the binomial distribution $S \\sim \\text{Binomial}(R, p)$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R = 30$$\n$$p = 0.20$$\n$$E[S] = 30 \\times 0.20 = 6$$\nThus, the expected number of follicles that reach the antral stage in that cycle is $6$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe antral follicle count (AFC) is a measure of the number of antral follicles present in the ovaries at a specific point in the menstrual cycle, typically assessed via transvaginal ultrasound. Our calculated expected value, $E[S] = 6$, represents the theoretical average number of follicles that would be observed at the antral stage, originating from the initial cohort of $30$ follicles, if the cycle were repeated many times under identical conditions. In any single, real-world cycle, the actual count is a random variable and may be slightly higher or lower than $6$ (e.g., $4$, $5$, $7$, $8$). However, $6$ is the statistically most likely outcome on average. This result demonstrates the substantial follicular attrition that occurs during folliculogenesis, where only a small fraction of the initially recruited follicles are expected to mature to the antral stage, a key pool from which a dominant follicle will later be selected for ovulation.",
