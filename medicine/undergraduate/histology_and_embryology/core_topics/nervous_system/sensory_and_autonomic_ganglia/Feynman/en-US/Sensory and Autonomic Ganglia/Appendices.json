            "introduction": "The speed at which a nerve impulse travels is a crucial determinant of an organism's reaction time and sensory processing capabilities. This velocity is not a fixed property but is intimately linked to the axon's histological features, primarily its diameter and the presence of a myelin sheath. This practice allows you to explore this fundamental structure-function relationship by applying key biophysical principles and established empirical formulas to calculate and compare the conduction velocities of different nerve fibers found in sensory and autonomic ganglia .",

            "problem": "In peripheral neuroanatomy, both sensory dorsal root ganglia and autonomic ganglia contain axons with distinct histologic features. Myelinated axons (for example, many large-diameter primary afferents and preganglionic autonomic axons) conduct action potentials by saltatory conduction, while unmyelinated axons (for example, many postganglionic autonomic axons and certain nociceptors) conduct continuously. Use the following base facts: the membrane time constant is $\\tau = R_{m} C_{m}$, the space constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$ where $r_{m}$ and $r_{i}$ are membrane and axial resistances per unit length, and electrotonic propagation speed scales as $v \\sim \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau}$. For a cylindrical axon of diameter $d$, $r_{m}$ scales as $\\frac{1}{d}$ and $r_{i}$ scales as $\\frac{1}{d^{2}}$. Myelination increases effective membrane resistance and decreases effective membrane capacitance across internodes, and saltatory conduction advances by a length approximately equal to the internode spacing, which scales approximately linearly with $d$ in peripheral nerves.\n\nFirst, use these definitions and scaling arguments to justify qualitatively why conduction velocity increases with axon diameter for both myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, and why myelinated fibers exhibit an approximately linear dependence of conduction velocity on $d$ in peripheral nerves. Then, treat the empirically established proportionality constants as given: for myelinated peripheral axons, adopt the Hursh factor so that the expected conduction velocity is $v \\approx 6 d$ when $v$ is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $d$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$; for unmyelinated peripheral axons in the physiological diameter range, adopt the empirical approximation $v \\approx 0.5 d$ with the same units.\n\nConsider the following representative axons from sensory and autonomic ganglia and their typical fiber diameters:\n1. A large myelinated primary afferent from a dorsal root ganglion (A$\\beta$ class): $d = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (myelinated).\n2. A thinly myelinated nociceptive primary afferent from a dorsal root ganglion (A$\\delta$ class): $d = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (myelinated).\n3. An unmyelinated polymodal nociceptor from a dorsal root ganglion (C class): $d = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (unmyelinated).\n4. A preganglionic autonomic axon (B class): $d = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (myelinated).\n5. A postganglionic autonomic axon (C class): $d = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (unmyelinated).\n\nCompute the expected conduction velocities for these five axons using the empirical relationships above. Express the final velocities in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$). Present the five velocities, in the order listed, as a single row vector. No rounding is required if your computed values are exact decimals.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established principles of neurophysiology and biophysics, specifically the cable theory of nerve conduction. The provided scaling laws, empirical formulas (such as the Hursh factor), and typical axon diameter values are standard and factually correct within the context of neuroscience. All information required for both the qualitative reasoning and the quantitative calculation is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: a qualitative justification of conduction velocity scaling and a quantitative calculation for specific axon types.\n\n**Part 1: Qualitative Justification of Conduction Velocity Scaling**\n\nThe velocity of signal propagation in an axon is fundamentally governed by its passive electrical properties, described by cable theory. The problem provides the key scaling relationship for electrotonic (passive) propagation speed, $v$, as a function of the axon's space constant, $\\lambda$, and time constant, $\\tau$:\n$$v \\sim \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau}$$\nThe space constant is defined as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}$, where $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{i}$ is the axial (internal) resistance per unit length. The time constant is $\\tau = r_{m}c_{m}$, where $c_{m}$ is the membrane capacitance per unit length.\n\n**Unmyelinated Axons:**\nFor an unmyelinated cylindrical axon of diameter $d$, the resistances and capacitance per unit length scale with diameter as follows:\n- The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_{m}$, is inversely proportional to the membrane surface area per unit length (the circumference), so $r_{m} \\sim \\frac{1}{d}$.\n- The axial resistance per unit length, $r_{i}$, is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the cytoplasm, so $r_{i} \\sim \\frac{1}{d^{2}}$.\n- The membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_{m}$, is directly proportional to the membrane surface area per unit length, so $c_{m} \\sim d$.\n\nFirst, we determine the scaling of the space constant, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{1/d}{1/d^{2}}} = \\sqrt{d}$$\nNext, we determine the scaling of the time constant, $\\tau$. The problem gives $\\tau = R_m C_m$, using specific membrane properties (per unit area), which are constant. However, for propagation velocity, the relevant time constant is derived from properties per unit length:\n$$\\tau = r_{m}c_{m} \\sim \\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right)(d) = d^{0}$$\nThis indicates that the time constant for an unmyelinated axon is approximately independent of its diameter.\n\nSubstituting the scaling relationships for $\\lambda$ and $\\tau$ into the velocity scaling equation:\n$$v \\sim \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau} \\sim \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{1} \\sim \\sqrt{d}$$\nThus, for unmyelinated axons, conduction velocity increases with diameter, proportional to the square root of the diameter. This justifies the qualitative statement that velocity increases with diameter.\n\n**Myelinated Axons:**\nIn myelinated axons, conduction is saltatory. The action potential is regenerated only at discrete locations called nodes of Ranvier, and it \"jumps\" from one node to the next. The velocity of conduction, $v$, is approximately the internodal distance, $L$, divided by the time it takes for the signal to propagate from one node and excite the next.\n\nThe problem provides the critical piece of information: \"saltatory conduction advances by a length approximately equal to the internode spacing, which scales approximately linearly with $d$ in peripheral nerves\". This means $L \\propto d$.\n\nThe time required to excite the next node is related to the time constant of the nodal membrane and the efficiency of the current spread along the internodal segment. Myelination drastically increases the effective membrane resistance and decreases the effective capacitance of the internodal membrane, which vastly increases the space constant $\\lambda$. This allows the current from one node to efficiently and rapidly depolarize the next node. If we make a simplifying assumption that the time delay at each node is roughly constant and independent of diameter (as all nodes are structurally similar), then the overall velocity is dominated by the internodal distance:\n$$v \\approx \\frac{L}{\\Delta t_{node}}$$\nSince $L \\propto d$ and we assume $\\Delta t_{node}$ is constant, it follows that:\n$$v \\propto d$$\nThis provides the justification for the approximately linear relationship between conduction velocity and axon diameter for myelinated fibers, as observed empirically. Myelination allows the velocity to overcome the less favorable $\\sqrt{d}$ scaling of unmyelinated fibers, achieving a much faster linear scaling.\n\n**Part 2: Quantitative Calculation of Conduction Velocities**\n\nWe now apply the given empirical formulas to calculate the conduction velocities for the five specified axons.\n\nThe formulas are:\n- For myelinated axons: $v \\approx 6d$, where $v$ is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $d$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- For unmyelinated axons: $v \\approx 0.5d$, where $v$ is in $\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $d$ is in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe axon data are:\n1.  A$\\beta$ class (myelinated): $d = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n2.  A$\\delta$ class (myelinated): $d = 2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n3.  C class, sensory (unmyelinated): $d = 0.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n4.  B class, autonomic (myelinated): $d = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n5.  C class, autonomic (unmyelinated): $d = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nThe calculations are as follows:\n\n1.  **A$\\beta$ class axon (myelinated):**\n    $v_{1} = 6 \\times d_{1} = 6 \\times 10 = 60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\n2.  **A$\\delta$ class axon (myelinated):**\n    $v_{2} = 6 \\times d_{2} = 6 \\times 2.5 = 15\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\n3.  **C class sensory axon (unmyelinated):**\n    $v_{3} = 0.5 \\times d_{3} = 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\n4.  **B class autonomic axon (myelinated):**\n    $v_{4} = 6 \\times d_{4} = 6 \\times 2.0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\n5.  **C class autonomic axon (unmyelinated):**\n    $v_{5} = 0.5 \\times d_{5} = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nThe five computed velocities, in the specified order, are $60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $15\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $0.4\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $12\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$. These will be presented as a single row vector in the final answer.",

On each section, $20$ systematically random, non-overlapping fields are sampled. Each field has a measured area of $0.05~\\mathrm{mm}^2$.
