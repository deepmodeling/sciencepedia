The rate of change of the mass of solute, $M_f$, within the fascicle volume $V_f$ is equal to the rate at which solute diffuses across the perineurium. The mass of solute in the fascicle is $M_f(t) = V_f C_f(t)$.

The flux density $J$ (mass per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the concentration gradient. Given the assumption of a homogeneous planar barrier and negligible storage within the perineurium, we can use a quasi-steady-state approximation where the concentration profile across the perineurium thickness $a$ is linear at any instant in time $t$.

Since $J_v$ is constant, this is simply:\n$$\\Delta V = J_v \\cdot T = (K_f \\cdot \\Delta P_{\\text{Starling}}) \\cdot T$$\nThe relationship between the accumulated volume $\\Delta V$ and the resulting change in endoneurial hydrostatic pressure, $\\Delta P_i$, is defined by the endoneurial compliance, $C_e$. Since $C_e$ is given as constant:\n$$C_e = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_i} \\implies \\Delta P_i = \\frac{\\Delta V}{C_e}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta V$ into the compliance equation gives the change in endoneurial pressure as a function of the system parameters:\n$$\\Delta P_i = \\frac{(K_f \\cdot \\Delta P_{\\text{Starling}}) \\cdot T}{C_e}$$\nThe problem asks for the excess increase in pressure due to the change in $K_f$.

The peripheral nerve is organized into fascicles, each enclosed by a tight, relatively non-compliant connective tissue sleeve called the perineurium. This structure creates a contained space, the endoneurium, meaning that even a small increase in fluid volume leads to a substantial rise in pressure, akin to a compartment syndrome. This elevated pressure has two primary detrimental effects on axons:\n$1$. Mechanical Compression: The increased $P_i$ physically compresses all structures within the endoneurium, including the myelinated axons. According to basic cable theory, the conduction velocity of a myelinated axon is approximately proportional to its diameter. Mechanical compression can reduce the axon's diameter, thereby slowing action potential propagation. Severe compression can deform the nodes of Ranvier or the paranodal axo-glial junctions, further disrupting saltatory conduction.\n$2$. Ischemia: The perfusion of endoneurial capillaries depends on the pressure gradient across them, specifically the arteriolar-venular pressure drop. A rise in the surrounding interstitial pressure ($P_i$) reduces the transmural pressure across capillaries and can compress them, increasing vascular resistance and decreasing blood flow. This leads to ischemia and subsequent hypoxia. The maintenance of ionic gradients across the axonal membrane, which is essential for the resting potential and repolarization after an action potential, relies on the continuous activity of ATP-dependent pumps (e.g., the $\\text{Na}^+/\\text{K}^+$-ATPase). Ischemia compromises the ATP supply, leading to pump failure. This results in a gradual decay of the resting membrane potential (depolarization), which in turn can lead to the inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, ultimately causing a failure of action potential propagation, known as conduction block.\nIn summary, an increase in endoneurial pressure is expected to cause a slowing of conduction velocity and, if sufficiently severe or prolonged, a complete block of nerve impulse transmission.",

The driving force for an ion species $X$ is the difference between the membrane potential $V_m$ and the ion's Nernst equilibrium potential $E_X$. Thus, $I_X = g_X(V_m - E_X)$. At the threshold for action potential initiation, the membrane potential is $V_m = V_{\\text{th}}$. Summing the currents for sodium, potassium, and leak at threshold yields the net nodal current:\n$$I_{\\text{net}} = I_{\\text{Na}} + I_{\\text{K}} + I_{L} = g_{\\text{Na}}(V_{\\text{th}} - E_{\\text{Na}}) + g_{\\text{K}}(V_{\\text{th}} - E_{\\text{K}}) + g_{L}(V_{\\text{th}} - E_{L})$$\nThis matches the expression given in the problem statement. By convention, an inward flow of positive charge (depolarizing current) is negative.\n\nThe propagation speed, $v$, in saltatory conduction is determined by the time it takes for an action potential at one node of Ranvier to bring the subsequent node to its threshold potential. This process involves charging the membrane capacitance of the next node, $C_{\\text{node}}$, by a voltage difference $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{th}} - V_{\\text{rest}}$. The total charge required is $\\Delta Q = C_{\\text{node}} \\Delta V$. This charge is delivered by the axial current, $I_{\\text{arriving}}$, that flows from the active node through the myelinated internode. The initial current generated at the active node is $|I_{\\text{net}}|$. The internode is modeled as a passive cable of length $d$ with a space constant $\\lambda$. According to passive cable theory, the current decays exponentially with distance, so the current arriving at the next node is $I_{\\text{arriving}} = |I_{\\text{net}}| \\exp(-d/\\lambda)$.\nThe time required to deliver the charge $\\Delta Q$ is $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta Q}{I_{\\text{arriving}}}$, assuming the current is approximately constant during this short charging phase. Substituting the expressions for $\\Delta Q$ and $I_{\\text{arriving}}$ gives:\n$$\\Delta t = \\frac{C_{\\text{node}} \\Delta V}{|I_{\\text{net}}| \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}$$\nThe propagation velocity is the internodal distance divided by this time delay: $v = \\frac{d}{\\Delta t}$. Substituting for $\\Delta t$ yields the expression provided in the problem:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{\\frac{C_{\\text{node}} \\Delta V}{|I_{\\text{net}}| \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}} = \\frac{d\\,|I_{\\text{net}}|\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}{C_{\\text{node}}\\,\\Delta V}$$\n\nNow, we proceed to compute the conduction velocity after the edema episode, $v_{\\text{edema}}$.\n\n**1. Calculate Post-Edema Extracellular Concentrations:**\nThe endoneurial volume increases by a fractional amount $\\alpha = 0.4$, diluting the extracellular ions. The new concentrations are:\n$[\\text{X}]_{\\text{o,new}} = \\frac{[\\text{X}]_{\\text{o,old}}}{1+\\alpha}$\nWith $\\alpha = 0.4$, the dilution factor is $1 + 0.4 = 1.4$.\n$$[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{o,new}} = \\frac{145\\,\\text{mM}}{1.4} \\approx 103.5714\\,\\text{mM}$$\n$$[\\text{K}]_{\\text{o,new}} = \\frac{4\\,\\text{mM}}{1.4} \\approx 2.85714\\,\\text{mM}$$\nThe intracellular concentrations, $[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{i}} = 15\\,\\text{mM}$ and $[\\text{K}]_{\\text{i}} = 140\\,\\text{mM}$, are unaffected.\n\n**2.

Simultaneously, the dilution of extracellular potassium makes the potassium equilibrium potential, $E_{\\text{K}}$, more negative, increasing the outward driving force for $\\text{K}^+$. Both effects combine to reduce the net inward current available to charge the next node, resulting in a slower conduction velocity.",
