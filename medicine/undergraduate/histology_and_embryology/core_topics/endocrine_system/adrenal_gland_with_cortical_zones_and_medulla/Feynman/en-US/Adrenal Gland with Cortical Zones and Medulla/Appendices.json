            "problem": "A paraffin-embedded human adrenal gland is sectioned along its longitudinal axis and its geometry is approximated as a right circular cylinder whose central core is the adrenal medulla and whose peripheral shell is the adrenal cortex. Histologically, the cortex comprises the zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis, and the medulla contains chromaffin cells. In a first-order geometric model, assume the medulla forms a solid inner cylinder of radius $R_{\\text{medulla}}$, and the cortex forms a cylindrical shell of uniform thickness $t_{\\text{cortex}}$ surrounding the medulla. The gland extends uniformly along the axis with height $h$.

            "problem": "An isolated mammalian adrenal gland is perfused in situ to study the coupling between the adrenal cortex and medulla. In normal physiology, the zona fasciculata of the cortex produces cortisol, which drains via the cortical–medullary portal circulation to bathe chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) gene transcription in chromaffin cells is induced by cortisol through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and induction is dose dependent via receptor–ligand binding. You may assume the following foundational facts:\n\n- Cortisol binds the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) with a dissociation constant $K_d$, and receptor occupancy increases with ligand concentration in a saturable manner characteristic of equilibrium binding.\n- The rate of PNMT transcription scales with GR activation, which is proportional to receptor occupancy, and steady-state PNMT messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) level reflects the balance between transcriptional production and first-order degradation under constant degradation kinetics.\n\nAt baseline, the medullary interstitial cortisol concentration is $[C]_0 = 8K_d$. An experimental intervention reduces zona fasciculata cortisol production by $50\\%$, and, due to the integrity of the cortical–medullary portal system and negligible systemic dilution in this preparation, the medullary interstitial cortisol concentration falls proportionally to $[C]_1 = 4K_d$.

The described biology of the adrenal cortico-medullary axis and the role of cortisol in inducing PNMT are factually correct.\n\nThe central task is to calculate the percentage change in the steady-state level of Phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). The problem states that the steady-state PNMT mRNA level is proportional to the fractional occupancy of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by its ligand, cortisol. Let the steady-state mRNA level be denoted by $[mRNA]_{ss}$ and the fractional receptor occupancy by $\\theta$. The relationship is:\n$$ [mRNA]_{ss} \\propto \\theta $$\n\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, for a ligand binding to a receptor with a Hill coefficient $n$ is given by the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[C]^n}{K_d^n + [C]^n} $$\nwhere $[C]$ is the cortisol concentration, $K_d$ is the dissociation constant, and $n$ is the Hill coefficient.\n\nThe problem specifies that the Hill coefficient is $n = 1$. This simplifies the equation to the standard Michaelis-Menten form for receptor binding:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[C]}{K_d + [C]} $$\n\nWe are given the initial (baseline) and final (post-intervention) cortisol concentrations in terms of $K_d$:\nInitial concentration: $[C]_0 = 8K_d$\nFinal concentration: $[C]_1 = 4K_d$\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial receptor occupancy, $\\theta_0$, at the baseline cortisol concentration $[C]_0$:\n$$ \\theta_0 = \\frac{[C]_0}{K_d + [C]_0} = \\frac{8K_d}{K_d + 8K_d} = \\frac{8K_d}{9K_d} = \\frac{8}{9} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the final receptor occupancy, $\\theta_1$, after the cortisol concentration is reduced to $[C]_1$:\n$$ \\theta_1 = \\frac{[C]_1}{K_d + [C]_1} = \\frac{4K_d}{K_d + 4K_d} = \\frac{4K_d}{5K_d} = \\frac{4}{5} $$\n\nSince $[mRNA]_{ss}$ is proportional to $\\theta$, the ratio of the final mRNA level to the initial mRNA level is equal to the ratio of the final occupancy to the initial occupancy:\n$$ \\frac{[mRNA]_1}{[mRNA]_0} = \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_0} $$\nThe percentage change in mRNA level is calculated as:\n$$ \\% \\text{ change} = \\left( \\frac{[mRNA]_1 - [mRNA]_0}{[mRNA]_0} \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{[mRNA]_1}{[mRNA]_0} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% $$\nSubstituting the occupancies:\n$$ \\% \\text{ change} = \\left( \\frac{\\theta_1}{\\theta_0} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% = \\left( \\frac{4/5}{8/9} - 1 \\right) \\times 100\\% $$\nWe simplify the ratio of the fractions:\n$$ \\frac{4/5}{8/9} = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{9}{8} = \\frac{36}{40} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9 $$\nNow, we can calculate the percentage change:\n$$ \\% \\text{ change} = (0.9 - 1) \\times 100\\% = -0.1 \\times 100\\% = -10\\% $$\nThe steady-state PNMT mRNA level decreases by $10\\%$.\n\nEvaluation of the options:\n\nA. PNMT mRNA decreases by approximately $10\\%$\nThis option accurately reflects the calculated result of a $-10\\%$ change.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. PNMT mRNA decreases by approximately $50\\%$\nThis would be the result if the response were directly proportional to the cortisol concentration, which itself decreased by $50\\%$ (from $8K_d$ to $4K_d$). However, the relationship is governed by saturable receptor binding. At concentrations above $K_d$, the receptor response is non-linear and dampened. The initial state is on a flatter part of the dose-response curve (occupancy is $8/9 \\approx 88.9\\%$), so a $50\\%$ drop in ligand concentration leads to a much smaller drop in effect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. PNMT mRNA increases by approximately $10\\%$\nCortisol is an inducer of PNMT transcription. A decrease in cortisol concentration must lead to a decrease, not an increase, in PNMT mRNA levels. This option has the wrong sign.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. PNMT mRNA shows negligible change (less than $1\\%$)\nThis would imply that the receptor was almost fully saturated (occupancy close to $100\\%$) and that the change in cortisol concentration did not significantly alter the occupancy. The initial occupancy is $\\theta_0 = 8/9 \\approx 88.9\\%$, and the final occupancy is $\\theta_1 = 4/5 = 80.0\\%$. The absolute change in occupancy is approximately $8.9\\%$. The relative change in the mRNA level, which is proportional to occupancy, is $-10\\%$. This is not a negligible change.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. PNMT mRNA decreases by approximately $33\\%$\nOur calculation rigorously shows a decrease of $10\\%$. A decrease of $33\\%$ (a factor of $1/3$) is numerically inconsistent with the derived result. There is no plausible misinterpretation of the receptor binding equations that would lead to this value.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

This translates to a reduction in the effective first-order rate constant for this pathway. The new, effective rate constant becomes $f \\cdot k_{21}$. The rate constant $k_L$ for the other pathway remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the rates of the two removal pathways under the genetic block are:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{21, \\text{block}} = (f \\cdot k_{21}) [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} $$\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{L} = k_{L} [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} $$\n\nThe total rate of removal is the sum of these two rates:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{removal, total}} = \\text{Rate}_{21, \\text{block}} + \\text{Rate}_{L} = (f \\cdot k_{21} + k_{L}) [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} $$\n\nAt steady state, we equate the rate of production and the total rate of removal:\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{production}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{removal, total}} $$\n$$ J_{p} = (f \\cdot k_{21} + k_{L}) [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} $$\n\nTo derive the expression for the steady-state concentration of $[17\\text{-}OHP]$ under the block, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} = \\frac{J_{p}}{f \\cdot k_{21} + k_{L}} $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided parameters:\n$J_{p} = 0.50 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}$\n$k_{21} = 0.60 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n$k_{L} = 0.15 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n$f = 0.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} = \\frac{0.50 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}}{(0.05)(0.60 \\text{ min}^{-1}) + 0.15 \\text{ min}^{-1}} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (0.05 \\times 0.60) + 0.15 \\text{ min}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 0.030 + 0.15 \\text{ min}^{-1} = 0.180 \\text{ min}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we perform the final division:\n$$ [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} = \\frac{0.50 \\text{ nmol min}^{-1} \\text{ mg}^{-1}}{0.180 \\text{ min}^{-1}} $$\n$$ [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} = \\frac{0.50}{0.180} \\text{ nmol mg}^{-1} \\approx 2.7777... \\text{ nmol mg}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ [17\\text{-}OHP]_{ss, \\text{block}} \\approx 2.778 \\text{ nmol mg}^{-1} $$\nThe final numerical answer is $2.778$.",
