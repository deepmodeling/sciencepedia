            "solution": "The problem requires the identification and calculation of the dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of inertial to viscous forces in the context of fluid flow in the embryonic node. This is achieved through the nondimensionalization of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations.\n\nThe starting point is the given equation for a Newtonian fluid:\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t}+\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\nabla \\mathbf{u}\\right)=-\\nabla p+\\mu \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u}+\\mathbf{f}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\mathbf{f}$ represents body forces. The terms on the left-hand side represent inertia (unsteady and convective), while the term $\\mu \\nabla^{2}\\mathbf{u}$ on the right-hand side represents viscous forces.\n\nTo nondimensionalize this equation, we introduce characteristic scales for velocity ($U$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). The problem specifies the time scale as $T = L/U$. We define dimensionless variables, denoted by an asterisk ($*$), as follows:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{U}, \\quad \\mathbf{x}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L}, \\quad t^* = \\frac{t}{T} = \\frac{tU}{L}\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express the differential operators in terms of the dimensionless coordinates:\n$$\n\\nabla = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{x}^*}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\mathbf{x}^*} = \\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*\n$$\n$$\n\\nabla^2 = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla = \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2}\\nabla^{*2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial t^*}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^*} = \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^*}\n$$\nWe also define a dimensionless pressure $p^*$ by scaling the pressure $p$ with a characteristic pressure $P_0$, such that $p^* = p/P_0$. The choice of $P_0$ depends on the dominant forces. In low-speed flows, the viscous stress scale, $P_0 = \\mu U / L$, is appropriate. The body force $\\mathbf{f}$ can be scaled by a characteristic value $F_0$, but since we are interested in the ratio of inertia to viscosity, we can omit this term for the core analysis.\n\nSubstituting these dimensionless variables and operators into the Navier–Stokes equation:\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\frac{\\partial (U\\mathbf{u}^*)}{\\partial t^*} + (U\\mathbf{u}^*)\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*\\right)(U\\mathbf{u}^*)\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^*\\right)p + \\mu\\left(\\frac{1}{L^2}\\nabla^{*2}\\right)(U\\mathbf{u}^*)\n$$\nFactoring out the dimensional scales gives:\n$$\n\\rho\\left(\\frac{U^2}{L}\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U^2}{L}(\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*)\\mathbf{u}^*\\right) = -\\frac{1}{L}\\nabla^* p + \\frac{\\mu U}{L^2}\\nabla^{*2}\\mathbf{u}^*\n$$\nThe terms in the parentheses multiplying $\\rho$ represent the characteristic magnitude of inertial force per unit volume, which is $\\sim \\rho U^2/L$. The term multiplying $\\mu$ represents the characteristic magnitude of viscous force per unit volume, which is $\\sim \\mu U/L^2$.\n\nThe single dimensionless group that quantifies the ratio of inertial to viscous effects is the ratio of these two magnitudes:\n$$\n\\text{Dimensionless Group} = \\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2/L}{\\mu U/L^2} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Reynolds number, denoted by $Re$.\n\nTo make this explicit in the equation, we can divide the entire equation by the characteristic viscous force per unit volume, $\\mu U/L^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho U^2/L}{\\mu U/L^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*)\\mathbf{u}^*\\right) = -\\frac{\\nabla^* p/L}{\\mu U/L^2} + \\nabla^{*2}\\mathbf{u}^*\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficients yields:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*)\\mathbf{u}^*\\right) = -\\left(\\frac{L}{\\mu U}\\right)\\nabla^*p + \\nabla^{*2}\\mathbf{u}^*\n$$\nBy defining $Re = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$ and a dimensionless pressure $p^* = \\frac{p}{\\mu U/L}$, the equation becomes fully dimensionless:\n$$\nRe\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{u}^*\\cdot\\nabla^*)\\mathbf{u}^*\\right) = -\\nabla^*p^* + \\nabla^{*2}\\mathbf{u}^*\n$$\nThis form clearly shows that the Reynolds number, $Re$, multiplies the inertial terms.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value of the Reynolds number using the provided parameters:\n- Fluid density $\\rho = 1.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- Dynamic viscosity $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}$\n- Characteristic velocity $U = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n- Characteristic length $L = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the Reynolds number:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s}}\n$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$ are equivalent to $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^{-1} \\cdot s^{-1}}$, ensuring that $Re$ is dimensionless.\n$$\nRe = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 2.0 \\times 5.0) \\times (10^3 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^{-5})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{-7}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}\n$$\n$$\nRe = 10.0 \\times 10^{-7 - (-3)} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-4} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $1.00 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nThis value, $Re = 1.00 \\times 10^{-3}$, is much less than $1$ ($Re \\ll 1$). This indicates that the inertial forces are three orders of magnitude smaller than the viscous forces. In the nondimensionalized Navier-Stokes equation, the entire left-hand side is multiplied by this small number, $Re$. It is therefore a valid approximation to neglect the inertial terms entirely. Setting the left-hand side to zero yields the Stokes equation, also known as the creeping flow equation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} \\approx -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThus, the very low value of the Reynolds number provides strong justification for using the creeping-flow approximation to model the fluid dynamics within the embryonic node.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics and developmental biology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. All data are consistent and physically plausible within the context of cellular microenvironments.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires the calculation of shear stress at the apical surface of a crown cell. The second part requires a biophysical explanation for the mechanotransduction mechanism involved in left-right axis specification.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Shear Stress\n\nThe constitutive law for a one-dimensional simple shear flow in a Newtonian fluid states that the shear stress, $\\tau$, is directly proportional to the local velocity gradient. For a fluid with velocity $u$ in the tangential direction that varies with height $y$ normal to the surface, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and $\\frac{du}{dy}$ is the rate of shear strain, or the velocity gradient.\n\nThe problem states that the velocity profile is linear. A linear velocity profile can be described by the function:\n$$\nu(y) = ay + b\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the constant velocity gradient and $b$ is the fluid velocity at the surface ($y=0$). The velocity gradient is the derivative of $u(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy}(ay + b) = a\n$$\nSince the velocity profile is linear, the gradient $a$ is constant throughout the fluid layer in the region of measurement. We can determine this constant gradient from the two given data points: $(y_1, u_1)$ and $(y_2, u_2)$.\n$$\na = \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{u_2 - u_1}{y_2 - y_1}\n$$\nThe shear stress $\\tau$ is therefore constant for all $y$ within this linear profile. The shear stress at the apical surface ($y=0$) is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{surface}} = \\mu \\left. \\frac{du}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = \\mu \\cdot a = \\mu \\left(\n\\frac{u_2 - u_1}{y_2 - y_1}\n\\right)\n$$\nThe key assumptions for this derivation are:\n1.  The nodal fluid behaves as an incompressible Newtonian fluid.\n2.  The flow is laminar and can be modeled as a one-dimensional simple shear flow.\n3.  The velocity profile is linear in the region between $y_1$ and $y_2$, as stated in the problem. This implies a constant velocity gradient, and thus a constant shear stress, in this region. The calculated shear stress is applied to the surface at $y=0$ under this linearity assumption.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of the shear stress. The given values must be converted to standard SI units (meters, seconds, Pascals).\nGiven:\n$y_1 = 3.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$u_1 = 40.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 40.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$y_2 = 7.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 7.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$u_2 = 129.6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 129.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\mu = 1.30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the velocity gradient, $a$:\n$$\na = \\frac{(129.6 - 40.0) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(7.0 - 3.0) \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{89.6 \\times 10^{-6}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 22.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the shear stress, $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\mu \\cdot a = (1.30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}) \\times (22.4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = 0.02912\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 2.912 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem specifies rounding the final answer to four significant figures, which is $2.912 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nPart 2: Biophysical Mechanism of Mechanotransduction\n\nThe sensing of fluid-flow-induced shear stress by crown cells at the embryonic node and its transduction into asymmetric molecular signals is a critical process in establishing left-right body asymmetry. The currently accepted mechanism is grounded in the \"two-cilia hypothesis\" and involves mechanotransduction via primary cilia.\n\n1.  **Sensing Apparatus**: The peripherally located crown cells possess solitary, immotile primary cilia that project into the nodal cavity. These cilia function as mechanosensors. They are distinct from the motile cilia in the center of the node that generate the fluid flow.\n\n2.  **Mechanical Actuation**: The directional, leftward flow of the nodal fluid generated by the motile cilia exerts a shear stress and a corresponding viscous drag force on the immotile cilia of the crown cells. This force causes the cilia on the left side of the node to bend, while the cilia on the right side experience significantly less or no flow and thus do not bend.\n\n3.  **Signal Transduction**: The mechanical bending of the cilium is converted into a biochemical signal. This process is mediated by a protein complex located in the ciliary membrane, composed of the polycystin proteins PKD1L1 and PKD2.\n    -   **PKD1L1 (Polycystin-1-like-1)** is hypothesized to be the primary mechanosensor that detects the physical strain of ciliary bending.\n    -   **PKD2 (Polycystin-2)** is a calcium-permeable cation channel. Upon activation by the mechanically-stimulated PKD1L1, the PKD2 channel opens.\n\n4.  **Generation of Asymmetric Signal**: The opening of the PKD2 channel allows for an influx of extracellular calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) into the cytoplasm of the crown cell. Because only the cilia on the left side of the node are bent by the flow, this $Ca^{2+}$ influx occurs specifically in the crown cells on the left, creating a localized, transient increase in intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ concentration. This asymmetric calcium signal is the first molecular event that breaks the embryo's bilateral symmetry.\n\n5.  **Downstream Molecular Cascade**: This asymmetric $Ca^{2+}$ signal on the left side initiates a downstream signaling pathway. It leads to the localized suppression of the expression of *Dand5* (also known as *Cerl2*), a gene that encodes an inhibitor of the Nodal signaling pathway. By repressing this inhibitor on the left side, the activity of the signaling molecule Nodal is permitted to increase. The resulting high concentration of Nodal on the left side of the node activates a well-characterized gene regulatory network involving transcription factors like *Lefty* and *Pitx2*, which ultimately orchestrates the asymmetric development of organs such as the heart, lungs, and gut.\n\nIn summary, the shear stress from the nodal flow is sensed by the bending of immotile primary cilia on crown cells, transduced into an asymmetric calcium signal via the PKD1L1/PKD2 channel complex, and subsequently converted into an asymmetric pattern of gene expression that defines the left-right body axis.",
