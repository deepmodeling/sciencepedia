            "problem": "A single nephron is modeled using well-tested fluid exchange principles for capillaries. The glomerular filtration barrier comprises fenestrated endothelium, a trilaminar glomerular basement membrane, and podocyte slit diaphragms; its size- and charge-selective properties can be summarized by an effective protein reflection coefficient $\\sigma$ that takes the value $\\sigma=1$ when proteins are effectively excluded from the filtrate. Under steady-state conditions, fluid flux across a semipermeable barrier is proportional to the overall filtration coefficient $K_f$ and the net driving pressure, which consists of hydrostatic forces opposed by the effective oncotic difference across the barrier. The glomerular capillary (GC) hydrostatic pressure is denoted $P_{GC}$, the Bowman's space (BS) hydrostatic pressure is $P_{BS}$, the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure is $\\pi_{GC}$, and the Bowman's space oncotic pressure is $\\pi_{BS}$. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the volumetric flow of filtrate into Bowman's space arising from this fluid flux integrated over the filtration surface.\n\nStarting from these principles and definitions, determine the numerical change in GFR when the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure $P_{GC}$ is increased by $5$ mmHg from its baseline, assuming that $K_f$ and the oncotic pressures remain unchanged and that $\\sigma=1$. Use the following baseline parameter values: $K_f = 12$ mL/min/mmHg, $\\sigma = 1$, $\\pi_{GC} = 25$ mmHg, $\\pi_{BS} = 0$ mmHg, and $P_{BS} = 10$ mmHg.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) resulting from a specific increase in the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_{GC}$). The relationship between GFR, the driving pressures, and the physical properties of the filtration barrier is described by the Starling equation, tailored for the glomerulus.\n\nThe glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the product of the filtration coefficient ($K_f$) and the net filtration pressure (NFP). This is stated as: \"fluid flux across a semipermeable barrier is proportional to the overall filtration coefficient $K_f$ and the net driving pressure\".\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f \\cdot \\text{NFP}\n$$\nThe net filtration pressure (NFP) is the sum of forces favoring filtration minus the sum of forces opposing it. The primary force favoring filtration is the glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $P_{GC}$. The forces opposing filtration are the Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure, $P_{BS}$, and the effective glomerular capillary oncotic pressure. The effective oncotic pressure is the product of the reflection coefficient, $\\sigma$, and the oncotic pressure gradient across the barrier, $(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})$. The problem states that $\\pi_{BS} = 0$, which is a standard assumption as the filtrate is nearly protein-free.\nThe NFP is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\text{NFP} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})\n$$\nSubstituting this into the GFR equation gives the full expression for glomerular filtration rate under the given model:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f [P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})]\n$$\nWe need to determine the change in GFR, which we denote as $\\Delta \\text{GFR}$, when $P_{GC}$ increases by a specified amount, $\\Delta P_{GC} = 5$ mmHg.

All other parameters ($K_f$, $P_{BS}$, $\\sigma$, $\\pi_{GC}$, $\\pi_{BS}$) are assumed to remain constant.\n\nThe change in GFR is the difference between the final and initial rates:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{GFR} = \\text{GFR}_2 - \\text{GFR}_1\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\text{GFR}_1$ and $\\text{GFR}_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{GFR} = K_f [P_{GC,2} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})] - K_f [P_{GC,1} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})]\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant filtration coefficient $K_f$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{GFR} = K_f \\left( [P_{GC,2} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})] - [P_{GC,1} - P_{BS} - \\sigma(\\pi_{GC} - \\pi_{BS})] \\right)\n$$\nExpanding the terms inside the parentheses leads to cancellation of the constant terms:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{GFR} = K_f ( P_{GC,2} - P_{BS} - \\sigma\\pi_{GC} + \\sigma\\pi_{BS} - P_{GC,1} + P_{BS} + \\sigma\\pi_{GC} - \\sigma\\pi_{BS} )\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{GFR} = K_f (P_{GC,2} - P_{GC,1})\n$$\nThe term $(P_{GC,2} - P_{GC,1})$ is precisely the change in glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, $\\Delta P_{GC}$.

Consider two dextran tracers with identical Stokes radius (thus identical hydrodynamic size): one is neutral and the other is anionic. In a steady-state filtration experiment at low Péclet number (diffusion-dominated transport through the slit diaphragm and pores), the sieving coefficient $\\theta$ of a solute is operationally defined as the filtrate-to-plasma concentration ratio across the barrier and equals the equilibrium partition ratio into the pore space. Assume that, for a solute encountering a pore, the equilibrium partition arises from two factors: a size-dependent steric partition factor and an energetic penalty $\\Delta G_{e}$ associated solely with electrostatic interactions, with the intra-pore concentration following the Boltzmann distribution at temperature $T$. The neutral dextran reports only the steric effect, while the anionic dextran reports both size and electrostatic effects. You are given measurements at physiological temperature $T$ such that the neutral dextran has sieving coefficient $\\theta_{\\mathrm{neutral}} = 0.30$ and the anionic dextran of the same Stokes radius has sieving coefficient $\\theta_{\\mathrm{anionic}} = 0.12$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of the sieving coefficient as an equilibrium partition ratio and the Boltzmann relation between concentration ratio and free energy difference, derive a relation that eliminates the steric contribution and compute the dimensionless electrostatic free energy penalty $\\Delta G_{e}/(k_{B}T)$ governing entry of the anionic dextran into the glomerular pores, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant.
