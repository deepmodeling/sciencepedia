Alveolar macrophages reside within the airspace and perform debris clearance but do not directly alter the mechanical surface tension at the air–liquid interface. Consider a single alveolus at end-expiration that is approximately spherical with radius $r$ and whose lining fluid would have a baseline surface tension $\\gamma_{0}$ in the absence of surfactant. Mechanical stability of a spherical air–liquid interface requires that the transmural pressure difference across the alveolar wall balances the curvature-dependent surface tension effect.

Carbon monoxide is used as a surrogate to quantify the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO), because its partial pressure in capillary plasma remains near zero due to rapid binding to hemoglobin.\n\nStarting from the definition of diffusing capacity for a gas as a proportionality constant between molar flux and the trans-barrier partial pressure difference, and the general physical principle that resistances in series add, reason that the overall diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide can be described as the combination of a membrane component (membrane diffusing capacity, DM) and a blood-phase reaction component characterized by the product of the specific conductance of blood for carbon monoxide, $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{CO}}$, and the pulmonary capillary blood volume, $V_{c}$.

It is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the relationship for the overall diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, $D_{L,\\mathrm{CO}}$, followed by a calculation using provided physiological data.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework. The diffusing capacity for a gas, $D$, is defined as the proportionality constant relating the molar flux of the gas, $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$, to the partial pressure difference across the barrier, $\\Delta P$.\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} = D \\cdot \\Delta P $$\nThis relationship can be rearranged to express the partial pressure difference as a function of the flux:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{1}{D} \\cdot \\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}} $$\nThis form is analogous to Ohm's Law in electrical circuits, $V = I \\cdot R$, where the voltage drop $V$ is analogous to the partial pressure difference $\\Delta P$, the current $I$ is analogous to the gas flux $\\dot{V}_{\\text{gas}}$, and the electrical resistance $R$ is analogous to the term $\\frac{1}{D}$. We can therefore define the resistance to gas transfer, $R_{\\text{gas}}$, as the reciprocal of the diffusing capacity:\n$$ R_{\\text{gas}} = \\frac{1}{D} $$\nThe problem states that the total process of carbon monoxide transfer from the alveolar gas to its binding site on hemoglobin within red blood cells can be modeled as two processes occurring in series. The first is the diffusion across the physical blood-gas barrier (the membrane), and the second is the reaction with hemoglobin within the capillary blood. Based on the general physical principle that resistances in series are additive, the total resistance, $R_{\\text{Total}}$, is the sum of the membrane resistance, $R_M$, and the blood-phase resistance, $R_B$.\n$$ R_{\\text{Total}} = R_M + R_B $$\nWe can express each resistance term as the reciprocal of its corresponding diffusing capacity.\nThe total resistance $R_{\\text{Total}}$ is the reciprocal of the overall diffusing capacity of the lung, $D_{L,\\mathrm{CO}}$:\n$$ R_{\\text{Total}} = \\frac{1}{D_{L,\\mathrm{CO}}} $$\nThe membrane resistance $R_M$ is the reciprocal of the membrane diffusing capacity, $D_{M,\\mathrm{CO}}$:\n$$ R_M = \\frac{1}{D_{M,\\mathrm{CO}}} $$\nThe resistance of the blood-phase reaction component, $R_B$, is related to the rate of CO uptake by the blood.
