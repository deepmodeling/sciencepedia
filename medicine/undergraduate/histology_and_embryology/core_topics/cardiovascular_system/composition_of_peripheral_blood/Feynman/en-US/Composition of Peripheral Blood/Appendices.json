            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated against the specified criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Definition: Hematocrit ($Hct$) is the volume fraction of red blood cells ($RBCs$) in whole blood.\n- Task 1: Derive an expression for hematocrit in terms of the red blood cell number density ($n_{RBC}$) and the mean volume per red blood cell ($\\bar{V}_{RBC}$).\n- Red blood cell number density: $n_{RBC} = 4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n- Mean corpuscular volume (MCV), equivalent to the mean volume per red blood cell: $\\bar{V}_{RBC} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL}$.\n- Unit conversion factor: $1\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Required output format: The final hematocrit value must be a unitless decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is fundamentally sound. It deals with standard, well-defined physiological parameters from hematology: hematocrit, red blood cell number density (RBC count), and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The given numerical values for $n_{RBC}$ ($4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ or $4.8\\,\\text{million}/\\mu\\text{L}$) and $\\bar{V}_{RBC}$ ($90\\,\\mathrm{fL}$) are within the typical physiological range for a healthy human adult.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is structured to have a unique and stable solution.

It is a straightforward application of physical definitions to a biological context, free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the hematocrit ($Hct$) based on foundational definitions.\n\n$1$. By definition, the hematocrit is the volume fraction of red blood cells ($V_{RBC, total}$) in a given total volume of whole blood ($V_{blood}$).\n$$Hct = \\frac{V_{RBC, total}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$2$. The total volume of red blood cells, $V_{RBC, total}$, is the product of the total number of red blood cells, $N_{RBC}$, in the sample and the mean volume of a single red blood cell, $\\bar{V}_{RBC}$.\n$$V_{RBC, total} = N_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\n\n$3$. Substituting the expression for $V_{RBC, total}$ from step $2$ into the definition of hematocrit from step $1$ yields:\n$$Hct = \\frac{N_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$4$. The red blood cell number density, $n_{RBC}$, is defined as the total number of red blood cells, $N_{RBC}$, per unit volume of whole blood, $V_{blood}$.\n$$n_{RBC} = \\frac{N_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}$$\n\n$5$. By rearranging the terms in the expression for $Hct$ from step $3$, we can isolate the term for number density.\n$$Hct = \\left(\\frac{N_{RBC}}{V_{blood}}\\right) \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\n\n$6$. Substituting the definition of number density, $n_{RBC}$, from step $4$ into the rearranged expression for $Hct$ from step $5$ gives the desired relationship.\n$$Hct = n_{RBC} \\times \\bar{V}_{RBC}$$\nThe principal assumption in this derivation is that the volume of whole blood, $V_{blood}$, is the reference volume for both the hematocrit ratio and the cell number density, which is consistent with standard clinical and physiological definitions.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided data.\nThe given values are:\n- Number density, $n_{RBC} = 4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n- Mean corpuscular volume, $\\bar{V}_{RBC} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL}$.\n\nTo ensure dimensional consistency, the volume unit must be the same for both quantities. We will convert femtoliters ($\\mathrm{fL}$) to liters ($\\mathrm{L}$) using the provided conversion factor, $1\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}$.\n$$\\bar{V}_{RBC} = 90\\,\\mathrm{fL} = 90 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nSubstitute the numerical values for $n_{RBC}$ and $\\bar{V}_{RBC}$ into the derived formula:\n$$Hct = (4.8 \\times 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (90 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{L})$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$Hct = (4.8 \\times 90) \\times (10^{12} \\times 10^{-15})$$\n$$Hct = 432 \\times 10^{-3}$$\n$$Hct = 0.432$$\n\nThe units ($\\mathrm{L}^{-1} \\times \\mathrm{L}$) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a volume fraction.\n\nThe problem explicitly requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $0.432$. To express this with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$Hct = 0.4320$$\nThis is the final answer expressed as a unitless decimal fraction.",

Rounding the calculated value of $7.600\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$ to $3$ significant figures gives $7.60\\ \\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the albumin-to-globulin ratio, denoted as $R_{A/G}$.

It is a valid quantitative problem in physiology.
