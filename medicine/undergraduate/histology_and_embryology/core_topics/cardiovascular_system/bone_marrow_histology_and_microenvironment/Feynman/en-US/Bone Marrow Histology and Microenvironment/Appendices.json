            "problem": "A posterior iliac crest bone marrow core biopsy is obtained with a measured core length of $15$ millimeters and a diameter of $2$ millimeters. Histologic evaluation indicates an adipocyte (fat) volume fraction of $0.40$, with adipocytes uniformly distributed throughout the core and no crush artifact. For this problem, define biopsy cellularity as the fraction of marrow space occupied by hematopoietic (non-adipocytic) tissue, and assume that mineralized trabecular bone volume is negligible or excluded from the measurement so that the core’s soft-tissue contents consist only of adipose and hematopoietic compartments.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and geometry, determine the biopsy cellularity as a single unitless value. Provide your answer as an exact fraction (do not use a percentage sign, and do not include units).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the biopsy cellularity, which is defined as the fraction of marrow space occupied by hematopoietic tissue. The problem provides several pieces of information, and the first step is to formalize the relationships between them.\n\nLet $V_{\\text{total}}$ represent the total volume of the soft-tissue contents of the biopsy core. This corresponds to the \"marrow space\" mentioned in the problem.\nLet $V_{\\text{adipose}}$ be the volume occupied by adipocytes (fat).\nLet $V_{\\text{hematopoietic}}$ be the volume occupied by hematopoietic tissue.\n\nThe problem states a crucial simplifying assumption: \"the core’s soft-tissue contents consist only of adipose and hematopoietic compartments.\" This allows us to write the total volume as the sum of its two components:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{adipose}} + V_{\\text{hematopoietic}}$$\n\nThe problem gives the adipocyte volume fraction as $0.40$. Let's denote this fraction as $f_{\\text{adipose}}$. By definition, a volume fraction is the ratio of the component volume to the total volume:\n$$f_{\\text{adipose}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{adipose}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} = 0.40$$\n\nThe quantity we are asked to find is the \"biopsy cellularity,\" which is defined as \"the fraction of marrow space occupied by hematopoietic (non-adipocytic) tissue.\" Let's denote this cellularity as $C_{\\text{biopsy}}$. Following the definition:\n$$C_{\\text{biopsy}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{hematopoietic}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nTo find the relationship between these fractions, we can take the equation for the total volume and divide all terms by $V_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\text{total}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{adipose}}}{V_{\\text{total}}} + \\frac{V_{\\text{hematopoietic}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions of the fractions, this equation becomes:\n$$1 = f_{\\text{adipose}} + C_{\\text{biopsy}}$$\n\nThis equation signifies that the sum of the fractions of all components must equal $1$, or $100\\%$. We can now solve for the biopsy cellularity, $C_{\\text{biopsy}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{biopsy}} = 1 - f_{\\text{adipose}}$$\n\nWe are given the value $f_{\\text{adipose}} = 0.40$. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$C_{\\text{biopsy}} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be an exact fraction. The decimal value $0.60$ can be written as:\n$$0.60 = \\frac{60}{100} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nThe problem provides the dimensions of the biopsy core: a length of $15$ millimeters and a diameter of $2$ millimeters. These values would allow for the calculation of the total volume of the core, which is modeled as a cylinder:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 l = \\pi \\left(\\frac{2 \\text{ mm}}{2}\\right)^2 (15 \\text{ mm}) = 15\\pi \\text{ mm}^3$$\nHowever, since the problem is defined in terms of volume fractions, the absolute value of the total volume $V_{\\text{total}}$ cancels out of the calculation. The geometric dimensions are therefore extraneous information, not required for finding the biopsy cellularity. The solution depends only on the relationship between the fractional components of the total volume.\n\nThus, the biopsy cellularity is $\\frac{3}{5}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the frequency of functional hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) within the total bone marrow mononuclear cell (BM-MNC) population, based on provided conditional and marginal frequencies.

The frequency of CD34$^{+}$ cells among BM-MNCs is $1\\%$. This can be expressed as a probability:\n$$P(C) = 1\\% = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\n$2$. The frequency of functional HSCs among CD34$^{+}$ cells is $1$ in $100$. This is a conditional probability, representing the probability of a cell being a functional HSC, given that it is a CD34$^{+}$ cell:\n$$P(H | C) = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\n\nThe objective is to calculate the frequency of functional HSCs among the total BM-MNC population. This corresponds to the marginal probability $P(H)$.\n\nThe problem states that HSCs are \"enriched among cells expressing the cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) surface antigen\". In the context of human hematopoiesis, this implies that the population of functional HSCs is a subset of the CD34$^{+}$ cell population. In set-theoretic terms, the set of cells corresponding to event $H$ is a subset of the set of cells corresponding to event $C$, which can be written as $H \\subseteq C$.\n\nConsequently, the intersection of events $H$ and $C$ is the event $H$ itself. This is because any cell that is a functional HSC (event $H$) must also be a CD34$^{+}$ cell (event $C$). Therefore, the event \"$H$ and $C$\" is logically equivalent to the event \"$H$\".\n$$H \\cap C = H$$\nThis implies that the probability of the intersection is equal to the probability of $H$:\n$$P(H \\cap C) = P(H)$$\n\nThe definition of conditional probability states that for any two events $A$ and $B$, with $P(B) > 0$:\n$$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our events $H$ and $C$:\n$$P(H | C) = \\frac{P(H \\cap C)}{P(C)}$$\nSubstituting $P(H \\cap C) = P(H)$ into this equation, we get:\n$$P(H | C) = \\frac{P(H)}{P(C)}$$\nWe are asked to find $P(H)$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $P(H)$:\n$$P(H) = P(H | C) \\times P(C)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this equation:\n$$P(H) = 0.01 \\times 0.01$$\n$$P(H) = 0.0001$$\nThus, the expected frequency of functional HSCs among the total bone marrow mononuclear cell population is $0.0001$.

The answer must be an analytic expression in terms of $q$, $D$, and $k$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a steady-state reaction-diffusion system. The governing equation is a one-dimensional, second-order, linear, inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation. This is a standard and fundamental model in many fields of science and engineering, including chemical kinetics and mathematical biology, for describing phenomena like morphogen gradients or chemokine distributions. The use of Fick's law for diffusion, first-order kinetics for degradation/removal, and a Dirac delta function for a point source are all well-established and scientifically sound modeling techniques. The biological context provided is accurate and serves as a realistic motivation for the mathematical model.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a differential equation and a sufficient set of boundary conditions ($C(x) \\to 0$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$) and continuity constraints ($C(x)$ continuous at $x=0$) to ensure the existence of a unique, stable solution. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and objective physical parameters. There is no subjective content.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The equation, boundary conditions, and parameters are all specified. A dimensional analysis confirms the consistency of the equation. Assuming $C$ is a volumetric concentration in $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, the terms $D C''$ and $kC$ have units of $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The problem's description of \"$q$ as a constant point-source rate\" is slightly ambiguous, but it is reasonably interpreted in this context as a source rate per unit cross-sectional area, making the setup consistent.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The model is an idealization (1D system), but it is a common and useful simplification in biophysical modeling. It does not contain physically impossible conditions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe governing differential equation for the steady-state concentration $C(x)$ is given as:\n$$ D\\,\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-k\\,C+q\\,\\delta(x)=0 $$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-\\frac{k}{D}C = -\\frac{q}{D}\\delta(x) $$\nLet us define a characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}C = -\\frac{q}{D}\\delta(x) $$\n\nFor any region where $x \\neq 0$, the Dirac delta term vanishes, and we have the homogeneous equation:\n$$ \\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}C = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this homogeneous equation is a linear combination of exponential functions:\n$$ C(x) = A_{1} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + A_{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\nwhere $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe must apply the boundary conditions separately for the regions $x > 0$ and $x < 0$.\n1.  For $x > 0$, the boundary condition $C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to \\infty$ requires the coefficient of the growing exponential term, $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$, to be zero. Thus, for $x>0$, $A_1 = 0$, and the solution is:\n    $$ C_{>}(x) = A_{R} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n2.  For $x < 0$, the boundary condition $C(x) \\to 0$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ requires the coefficient of the decaying exponential term, $\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, to be zero. Thus, for $x<0$, $A_2 = 0$, and the solution is:\n    $$ C_{<}(x) = A_{L} \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem states that the concentration profile $C(x)$ must be continuous at $x=0$.\n$$ \\lim_{x\\to 0^+} C_{>}(x) = \\lim_{x\\to 0^-} C_{<}(x) $$\n$$ A_{R} \\exp(0) = A_{L} \\exp(0) \\implies A_{R} = A_{L} $$\nLet us call this common constant $A$. The solution can be written in a single form using the absolute value function:\n$$ C(x) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|}{\\lambda}\\right) = A \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nThis form satisfies the boundary conditions at $|x|\\to\\infty$ and the continuity at $x=0$. The value of $A$ is determined by the source term $q\\delta(x)$.\n\nTo find $A$, we integrate the full inhomogeneous differential equation over a small interval $[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon]$ around the origin and then take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D\\,\\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}}-k\\,C+q\\,\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0 $$\n$$ D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}} dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx + q \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = 0 $$\nEvaluating each term in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$:\n- The first term gives the jump in the first derivative:\n  $$ D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^{2}C}{dx^{2}} dx = D \\left[\\frac{dC}{dx}\\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} = D \\left( \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=\\epsilon} - \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=-\\epsilon} \\right) $$\n- The second term vanishes because $C(x)$ is continuous and finite:\n  $$ \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0} k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx = k \\cdot C(0) \\cdot (2\\epsilon) = 0 $$\n- The third term is, by definition of the delta function:\n  $$ q \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = q \\cdot 1 = q $$\nThis procedure yields the **jump condition** for the first derivative of the concentration at the source:\n$$ D \\left( \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0^+} - \\frac{dC}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0^-} \\right) + q = 0 $$\nNow, we compute the derivatives from our solution $C(x) = A \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$:\n- For $x > 0$, $C(x) = A \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^+$, $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{A}{\\lambda}$.\n- For $x < 0$, $C(x) = A \\exp(x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\exp(x/\\lambda)$. At $x=0^-$, $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{A}{\\lambda}$.\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the jump condition:\n$$ D \\left( \\left(-\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{A}{\\lambda}\\right) \\right) + q = 0 $$\n$$ D \\left( -\\frac{2A}{\\lambda} \\right) = -q $$\n$$ A = \\frac{q\\lambda}{2D} $$\nSubstituting back $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$:\n$$ A = \\frac{q \\sqrt{D/k}}{2D} = \\frac{q}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} $$\nThus, the complete closed-form solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$ C(x) = \\frac{q}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-|x|\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nThe problem asks for the concentration at a distance $x=50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We convert this distance to base SI units: $x = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $C(x)$:\n$$ C(5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = \\frac{q}{2\\sqrt{Dk}} \\exp\\left(-(5 \\times 10^{-5})\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression in terms of the parameters $q$, $D$, and $k$. The units are $\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, as verified during validation.",
