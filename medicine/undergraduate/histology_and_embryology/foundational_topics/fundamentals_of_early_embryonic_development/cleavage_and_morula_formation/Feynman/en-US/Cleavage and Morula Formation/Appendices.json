            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the mean blastomere radius after a specified number of cell divisions, a numerical calculation for a specific case, and a qualitative explanation for potential deviations from the idealized model. The problem statement is scientifically grounded in the principles of early embryology, is well-posed with sufficient information, and uses objective language. It is therefore a valid problem.\n\nLet $R_0$ be the initial radius of the spherical ovum. The volume of the ovum, $V_0$, is given by the formula for the volume of a sphere:\n$$V_0 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3$$\nThe problem states that early cleavage occurs without net growth, meaning the total volume of the conceptus remains constant and equal to the initial volume of the ovum, $V_0$. Let $n$ be the number of symmetric cleavage divisions. Since each division doubles the number of cells, the total number of blastomeres, $N_n$, after $n$ divisions is:\n$$N_n = 2^n$$\nAs these divisions are symmetric, all $N_n$ blastomeres are of equal size. Let $R_n$ be the radius of a single blastomere after $n$ divisions, which we are asked to find. Assuming each blastomere is a sphere, its volume, $V_n$, is:\n$$V_n = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_n^3$$\nThe total volume of the conceptus after $n$ divisions is the number of blastomeres multiplied by the volume of a single blastomere:\n$$V_{total} = N_n \\cdot V_n = (2^n) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_n^3\\right)$$\nAccording to the principle of volume conservation given in the problem, this total volume must equal the initial volume $V_0$.\n$$V_0 = V_{total}$$\n$$\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_0^3 = (2^n) \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R_n^3\\right)$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$R_0^3 = 2^n R_n^3$$\nTo derive an expression for $R_n$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $R_n^3$:\n$$R_n^3 = \\frac{R_0^3}{2^n}$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides yields the expression for the blastomere radius $R_n$ in terms of the initial ovum radius $R_0$ and the number of divisions $n$:\n$$R_n = \\left(\\frac{R_0^3}{2^n}\\right)^{1/3} = \\frac{(R_0^3)^{1/3}}{(2^n)^{1/3}} = \\frac{R_0}{2^{n/3}}$$\nThis is the general expression for the mean blastomere radius.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value for an ovum of radius $R_0 = 60 \\ \\mu\\text{m}$ after $n = 8$ cleavages. Substituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$R_8 = \\frac{60}{2^{8/3}}$$\nTo evaluate the denominator, we can write $2^{8/3}$ as $(2^8)^{1/3}$ or $(\\sqrt[3]{2})^8$. Calculating $2^8 = 256$, we have:\n$$R_8 = \\frac{60}{\\sqrt[3]{256}}$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt[3]{256} \\approx 6.3496042$.

In vivo, slight deviations from perfect equality of blastomere size can still arise in an isolecithal ovum because the orientation and positioning of the mitotic spindle, which determines the plane of cleavage, are subject to minor stochastic variations and may not align perfectly with the cell's geometric center for every division. Consequently, cytokinesis can result in daughter cells of slightly unequal volume, even when the initial cytoplasmic composition is uniform.",

It is a well-posed problem in geometry. The assumptions are clearly stated, internally consistent, and sufficient to derive a solution. No scientific laws are violated. The language is objective and precise.\n\n- **Scientific/Factual Soundness**: The model is a simplification but is based on valid biophysical and geometric principles. No flaws.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is structured to find a unique, meaningful answer ($M$ and $N_{\\text{inner}}$) from the given constraints. No flaws.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is free of bias or subjective claims. No flaws.\n- **Completeness/Consistency**: The given information is sufficient. Assumption (i) (volume conservation) and assumption (ii) ($N=16$ spherical cells filling the volume) together define a crucial relationship between $R$ and $r$. Let $V_{\\text{cell}}$ be the volume of a single blastomere and $V_{\\text{ZP}}$ be the volume of the interior of the ZP.\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot V_{\\text{cell}} = 16 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right)$$\n$$V_{\\text{ZP}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$\nEquating these gives $16 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$, which simplifies to $16r^3 = R^3$. This provides a direct constraint: $R = 16^{1/3}r$. The problem is self-contained. No flaws.\n- **Feasibility**: The conditions are idealized but not physically impossible for a mathematical model. No flaws.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem is to determine the maximum number of non-overlapping spheres of radius $r$ (the outer cells) that can be arranged such that they are all tangent to an outer containing sphere of radius $R$. This is a classic geometric packing problem.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the radius of the blastomeres, $r$, and the inner radius of the Zona Pellucida, $R$. Based on the volume conservation principle (assumptions i and ii), the total volume of the $N=16$ cells must equal the volume of the sphere defined by the ZP's inner boundary.\n$$N \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$$\n$$16 r^3 = R^3$$\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives the relationship between $R$ and $r$:\n$$R = (16)^{1/3} r = (2^4)^{1/3} r = 2^{4/3} r$$\n\nNext, we consider the geometry of the outer cells. An outer cell is tangent to the inner surface of the ZP. This means the distance from the center of the ZP (which we take as the origin) to the center of an outer cell is $R-r$. The problem defines this distance as $\\rho$.\n$$\\rho = R - r = (2^{4/3} - 1)r$$\nAll outer cell centers lie on the surface of a sphere of radius $\\rho$.\n\nThe constraint that two outer cells cannot overlap implies their surfaces cannot intersect. Since they are identical spheres of radius $r$, the minimum distance between the centers of any two outer cells is $2r$.\n\nLet us consider two outer cell centers, $C_1$ and $C_2$, positioned at this minimum separation distance, $d = |C_1 C_2| = 2r$. Let $O$ be the center of the ZP. The points $O$, $C_1$, and $C_2$ form an isosceles triangle with side lengths $|OC_1| = \\rho$, $|OC_2| = \\rho$, and $|C_1 C_2| = 2r$.\n\nThe problem suggests modeling the packing limit by considering the non-overlapping spherical caps excluded by each outer cell. The \"angular radius\" $\\beta$ of such a cap corresponds to the angle subtended at the center $O$ by the radius of the `footprint` of a cell on the sphere of radius $\\rho$. Let's bisect the triangle $\\triangle OC_1 C_2$ with a line from $O$ to the midpoint of the segment $C_1 C_2$. This forms two right-angled triangles, each with hypotenuse $\\rho$, one leg of length $r$, and the angle at $O$ being $\\beta$. The angle $\\beta$ must satisfy:\n$$\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{r}{\\rho}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho$:\n$$\\sin(\\beta) = \\frac{r}{(2^{4/3} - 1)r} = \\frac{1}{2^{4/3} - 1}$$\n\nThe problem asks for an upper bound on $M$, the number of outer cells, based on the area of these spherical caps. The surface area of the sphere of radius $\\rho$ is $A_{\\text{sphere}} = 4\\pi\\rho^2$. The surface area of a single spherical cap of angular radius $\\beta$ is $A_{\\text{cap}} = 2\\pi\\rho^2(1 - \\cos\\beta)$.\n\nAn upper bound for $M$ is the ratio of the total available surface area to the area of one cap. This is known as the Rankin bound.\n$$M \\le \\frac{A_{\\text{sphere}}}{A_{\\text{cap}}} = \\frac{4\\pi\\rho^2}{2\\pi\\rho^2(1 - \\cos\\beta)} = \\frac{2}{1 - \\cos\\beta}$$\nSince $\\beta$ is an angle in a right triangle, it is acute, so $\\cos\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\beta}$.\n$$M \\le \\frac{2}{1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\beta}}$$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\sin\\beta$:\n$$M \\le \\frac{2}{1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2^{4/3} - 1}\\right)^2}}$$\n\nTo find the numerical value of $M$, we must evaluate this expression. Let $k = 2^{4/3} = (16)^{1/3}$.\nWe can approximate the value of $k$. We know $2^3=8$ and $3^3=27$. $2.5^3 = 15.625$. So $k$ is slightly larger than $2.5$. A more precise value is $k \\approx 2.51984$.\nThen, $k-1 \\approx 1.51984$.\n$\\sin\\beta = \\frac{1}{k-1} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.51984} \\approx 0.65796$.\n$\\cos\\beta = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\beta} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - (0.65796)^2} \\approx \\sqrt{1 - 0.43291} = \\sqrt{0.56709} \\approx 0.75305$.\nNow we compute the bound for $M$:\n$$M \\le \\frac{2}{1 - \\cos\\beta} \\approx \\frac{2}{1 - 0.75305} = \\frac{2}{0.24695} \\approx 8.0988$$\nSince $M$ must be an integer, the maximum possible number of outer cells is $\\lfloor 8.0988 \\rfloor = 8$.\nTherefore, the maximal number of outer cells is $M=8$.\n\nThis result can be rigorously confirmed by methods from the theory of spherical codes. The angular separation between the centers of two adjacent outer cells is $\\theta = 2\\beta$.\n$\\theta = 2\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{4/3}-1}\\right) \\approx 2 \\times \\arcsin(0.65796) \\approx 2 \\times 41.15^{\\circ} \\approx 82.3^{\\circ}$.\nThe problem is to find the maximum number of points, $M$, that can be placed on a sphere with a minimum angular separation of $\\theta \\approx 82.3^{\\circ}$. For $M=9$, the maximum possible angular separation is $\\theta_{9,opt} = \\arccos(1/3) \\approx 70.53^{\\circ}$. Since our required separation ($82.3^{\\circ}$) is greater than what is possible for $9$ points ($70.53^{\\circ}$), we cannot fit $9$ outer cells. For $M=8$, the points can be arranged as the vertices of a square antiprism, which allows for a maximum separation of $\\theta_{8,opt} \\approx 99.88^{\\circ}$. Since our required separation ($82.3^{\\circ}$) is less than this, it is possible to fit $8$ outer cells. Thus, the maximum number is indeed $M=8$.\n\nFinally, we compute the minimal number of inner cells, $N_{\\text{inner}}$. These are the cells that do not contact the ZP. The total number of cells is $N=16$.\n$$N_{\\text{inner}} = N - M = 16 - 8 = 8$$\nThus, in this idealized model, the $16$-cell embryo would consist of $8$ outer cells and $8$ inner cells. This arrangement is a known feature of the morula stage, where an inner cell mass (embryoblast) begins to form, segregated from the outer cell layer (trophectoderm).\n\nThe required answer is the ordered pair $(M, N_{\\text{inner}})$.\n$$(M, N_{\\text{inner}}) = (8, 8)$$",

For physical adhesion, $w > 0$, implying $x^{\\ast} > 0$. We assume conditions where $w < 4k$ so that $x^{\\ast} < 1$.\n\nThe compaction condition is given by $x^{\\ast} \\ge x_{c}$. Substituting our expression for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{w}{4k} \\ge x_{c}$$\nThis is the analytic condition separating loose and compacted states. It can also be expressed for the work of adhesion as $w \\ge 4 k x_{c}$.\n\n**(c) Calculation of the Critical Work of Adhesion $w_{c}$**\n\nThe critical work of adhesion, $w_{c}$, is the minimum work of adhesion required to reach the compaction threshold, i.e., the value of $w$ for which $x^{\\ast} = x_{c}$.\nUsing the relationship from part (b):\n$$w_{c} = 4 k x_{c}$$\nWe are given the numerical values:\n$$k = 0.010 \\, \\text{J/m}^{2}$$\n$$x_{c} = 0.300$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$w_{c} = 4 \\times (0.010 \\, \\text{J/m}^{2}) \\times 0.300$$\n$$w_{c} = 0.040 \\, \\text{J/m}^{2} \\times 0.300$$\n$$w_{c} = 0.012 \\, \\text{J/m}^{2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$w_{c} = 0.0120 \\, \\text{J/m}^{2}$$\nIn the requested standard scientific notation, this is $1.20 \\times 10^{-2}$ J/m$^{2}$.",
