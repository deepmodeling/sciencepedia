It is a well-formulated question based on fundamental principles of muscle physiology. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution to this problem hinges on understanding the distinct mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, with a specific focus on the role of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (L-type VGCCs, also known as dihydropyridine receptors or DHPRs) in each tissue type. The drug is a selective blocker of these channels.\n\n1.  **Skeletal Muscle (preparation i):**\n    In mature mammalian skeletal muscle, ECC involves a direct, physical coupling between the L-type VGCCs in the T-tubule membrane and the ryanodine receptors (RyR1) in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). When an action potential propagates down the T-tubule, it causes a conformational change in the L-type VGCC. This channel acts primarily as a voltage sensor. The conformational change is mechanically transmitted to the RyR1, causing it to open and release a large quantity of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR into the cytosol. This flood of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR is the primary trigger for contraction. The influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through the L-type VGCC itself is negligible and **not required** to trigger SR $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. Therefore, blocking the pore of the L-type VGCC will have little to no effect on the voltage-sensing mechanism and the subsequent mechanical activation of RyR1.\n    *Prediction:* Application of the L-type VGCC blocker will cause **no significant change** in peak isometric tension.\n\n2.  **Cardiac Muscle (preparation ii):**\n    In ventricular cardiac muscle, the ECC mechanism is fundamentally different and is known as calcium-induced calcium release (CICR). During the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, depolarization opens L-type VGCCs in the T-tubule membrane. This opening allows a significant influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the cardiomyocyte. This influx of \"trigger\" $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to and activates ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the SR. The activation of RyR2 opens these channels, leading to the release of a much larger amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR. The strength of the cardiac contraction is directly proportional to the amount of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from the SR, which in turn is dependent on the magnitude of the initial \"trigger\" $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through the L-type VGCCs.\n    *Prediction:* Blocking the L-type VGCCs will prevent the influx of trigger $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thereby preventing or severely attenuating CICR. This will lead to a failure to generate a significant rise in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and, consequently, a **marked decrease** in peak isometric tension.\n\n3.  **Vascular Smooth Muscle (preparation iii):**\n    The regulation of contraction in smooth muscle is complex, but it is highly dependent on the influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Field stimulation will cause depolarization, which opens L-type VGCCs. The resulting influx of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ contributes to the increase in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in two ways: (1) by directly binding to calmodulin to initiate the contractile cascade (activation of Myosin Light Chain Kinase), and (2) by potentially triggering CICR from the less-developed SR. Sustained contraction (tone) in vascular smooth muscle, in particular, relies heavily on a continuous influx of extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Therefore, blocking the L-type VGCCs, a major pathway for this influx, will substantially reduce the ability of the muscle to develop and maintain tension.\n    *Prediction:* Blocking the L-type VGCCs will significantly inhibit the rise in cytosolic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ necessary for contraction, leading to a **marked decrease** in isometric tone.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- Skeletal muscle: No significant change.\n- Cardiac muscle: Marked decrease.\n- Smooth muscle: Marked decrease.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Skeletal muscle: no significant change; Cardiac muscle: marked decrease; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option perfectly aligns with the derived predictions based on the distinct ECC mechanisms in the three muscle types. Skeletal muscle ECC is independent of $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through L-type channels, whereas both cardiac and vascular smooth muscle contraction are critically dependent on it.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Skeletal muscle: marked decrease comparable to cardiac; Cardiac muscle: no significant change; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option incorrectly states that skeletal muscle tension will decrease and cardiac muscle tension will not. This is the reverse of the established physiological roles of L-type VGCCs in these two tissues.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Skeletal muscle: no significant change; Cardiac muscle: no significant change except at very high stimulation frequencies; Smooth muscle: no significant change because it relies predominantly on intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release.**\nThis option is incorrect on two counts. First, cardiac muscle contraction is dependent on L-type channel influx for every beat, not just at high frequencies. A blocker would cause a marked decrease at any stimulation frequency. Second, it incorrectly claims that smooth muscle relies predominantly on intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and would be unaffected. Vascular smooth muscle tone is highly dependent on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Skeletal muscle: increase due to reduced $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ efflux; Cardiac muscle: marked decrease; Smooth muscle: marked decrease.**\nThis option makes the unfounded claim that tension in skeletal muscle will increase. The drug is an L-type VGCC *blocker*, which inhibits $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ *influx*. It has no direct effect on efflux mechanisms (like SERCA or PMCA pumps) that would lead to an increase in intracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. All three tissues exhibit equivalent decreases because they all rely equally on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx for contraction.**\nThis option incorrectly assumes that the reliance on extracellular $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is equal across all three muscle types. This ignores the fundamental difference in the ECC mechanism of skeletal muscle compared to cardiac and smooth muscle. The effect is not equivalent; it is negligible in skeletal muscle and profound in the other two.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Let $C_{\\mathrm{L}}$, $C_{\\mathrm{cell}}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{I}}$ be the glucose concentrations in the lumen, the intestinal epithelial cell, and the interstitium, respectively. According to the provided model, the flux across the apical membrane ($J_{\\mathrm{ap}}$) and the basolateral membrane ($J_{\\mathrm{bl}}$) are given by:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{ap}} = P_{\\mathrm{ap}}(C_{\\mathrm{L}} - C_{\\mathrm{cell}})$$\n$$J_{\\mathrm{bl}} = P_{\\mathrm{bl}}(C_{\\mathrm{cell}} - C_{\\mathrm{I}})$$\nAt steady state, the flux must be conserved through the series pathway, so the net transcellular flux $J_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ is equal to both $J_{\\mathrm{ap}}$ and $J_{\\mathrm{bl}}$:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{trans}} = J_{\\mathrm{ap}} = J_{\\mathrm{bl}}$$\nWe can eliminate the intermediate variable $C_{\\mathrm{cell}}$ to relate $J_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ directly to the overall concentration gradient, $C_{\\mathrm{L}} - C_{\\mathrm{I}}$.

Discussion on the Impact of Paracellular Permeability\n\nThe total permeability of the epithelial sheet is given by $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = P_{\\mathrm{trans}} + P_{\\mathrm{para}}$. The net flux is directly proportional to this total permeability, $J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = P_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\Delta C$. The paracellular permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{para}}$, represents the leakiness of the tight junctions.\n\nIf the tight junctions become \"tighter,\" their resistance to solute passage increases, which corresponds to a decrease in $P_{\\mathrm{para}}$. According to the additive relationship $P_{\\mathrm{tot}} = P_{\\mathrm{trans}} + P_{\\mathrm{para}}$, a decrease in $P_{\\mathrm{para}}$ will directly lead to a decrease in $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, assuming $P_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ is unaffected. Consequently, the net sheet flux, $J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, will decrease. An epithelium with very tight junctions (low $P_{\\mathrm{para}}$) is \"tight\" and restricts passive solute movement, with total transport dominated by the transcellular pathway.\n\nConversely, if the tight junctions become \"looser\" or \"leakier,\" their resistance to solute passage decreases, which corresponds to an increase in $P_{\\mathrma}$. This will cause an increase in $P_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and, therefore, an increase in the net sheet flux, $J_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. An epithelium with very leaky junctions (high $P_{\\mathrm{para}}$) is \"leaky,\" and the paracellular shunt pathway can contribute significantly to, or even dominate, the total solute flux across the tissue. Thus, the tightness of the junctions is a critical determinant of the barrier function of the epithelium.",
