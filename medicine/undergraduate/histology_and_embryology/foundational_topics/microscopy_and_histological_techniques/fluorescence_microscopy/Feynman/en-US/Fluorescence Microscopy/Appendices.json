They have synthesized a new fluorescent probe that has a high binding affinity specifically for lipid A. The researcher prepares two slides: one with a pure culture of *Staphylococcus aureus* and another with a pure culture of *Escherichia coli*. Both slides are treated with the new fluorescent probe under optimal binding conditions. After a washing step to remove any unbound probe, the slides are observed under a fluorescence microscope.\n\nAssuming the probe functions as designed, which of the following outcomes is expected?\n\nA. Only the *Staphylococcus aureus* cells will fluoresce.\nB. Only the *Escherichia coli* cells will fluoresce.\nC. Both the *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Escherichia coli* cells will fluoresce.\nD. Neither type of cell will fluoresce.",
            "solution": "The probe is designed to bind specifically to lipid A. Lipid A is the lipid component of lipopolysaccharide located in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria; it is not present in Gram-positive bacteria. Therefore:\n1. Identify cell envelope structures:\n- Staphylococcus aureus is Gram-positive, lacks an outer membrane, and does not contain lipopolysaccharide or lipid A; instead it has a thick peptidoglycan layer with teichoic acids.\n- Escherichia coli is Gram-negative, possesses an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide, whose hydrophobic anchor is lipid A.\n2. Apply binding specificity:\n- Under optimal binding conditions, a probe with high affinity and specificity for lipid A will bind to surfaces where lipid A is present, i.e., the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.\n- No lipid A target exists on Staphylococcus aureus; thus the probe will not bind specifically to those cells.\n3. Washing step logic:\n- The wash removes unbound probe; only probe that has bound to its specific target remains associated with cells.\n- Consequently, only the Escherichia coli cells retain the probe and will fluoresce under the microscope, while Staphylococcus aureus cells will not fluoresce.\n\nHence, only the Escherichia coli cells will fluoresce.",

The first strain has been engineered to express superfolder Green Fluorescent Protein (sfGFP), which has an excitation peak at 485 nm and an emission peak at 510 nm. The second strain has been engineered to express mCherry, a red fluorescent protein with an excitation peak at 587 nm and an emission peak at 610 nm.\n\nThe student's goal is to use a fluorescence microscope to specifically visualize and image the sfGFP-expressing cells, ensuring that no fluorescence signal from the mCherry-expressing cells is detected. The microscope's filter cube must be assembled by selecting one component from each of the three categories available in the lab's shared inventory: an excitation filter, a dichroic mirror, and an emission filter.\n\nThe specifications for the available optical components are as follows:\n- **Excitation Filters (Bandpass):** These filters transmit light within a specific range.

            "introduction": "While fluorescence microscopy allows us to see the invisible, the laws of physics impose a fundamental limit on how small a detail we can resolve.

The microscope employs an oil-immersion objective specified with Numerical Aperture (NA) $\\mathrm{NA}=1.4$, and the immersion oil has refractive index $n=1.515$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental principles of diffraction-limited imaging, namely that image detail is constrained by the wave nature of light and the geometry of a circular pupil, and using the definition of Numerical Aperture (NA) as $\\mathrm{NA}=n\\sin(\\theta)$ where $\\theta$ is the maximal half-angle of light accepted by the objective, derive the general expressions for the lateral (in-plane) resolution and an approximate axial (out-of-plane) resolution in terms of $\\lambda$, $n$, and $\\mathrm{NA}$.

            "solution": "The resolution of a microscope is fundamentally limited by the diffraction of light. A point source of light, when imaged by an objective with a circular pupil, creates a three-dimensional diffraction pattern known as the Point Spread Function (PSF). The size and shape of the central maximum of this PSF determine the smallest distance at which two distinct objects can be distinguished.\n\n**1. Lateral (In-Plane) Resolution**\n\nThe lateral resolution, $d_{xy}$, describes the minimum resolvable distance between two points in the focal plane ($xy$-plane). Its derivation is based on the Rayleigh criterion. This criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable when the central maximum of the Airy pattern (the 2D PSF in the focal plane) of one source coincides with the first minimum of the Airy pattern of the second source.\n\nThe resolution limit, corresponding to the radius of the central Airy disk in the object space, is given by the expression:\n\n$$d_{xy} = \\frac{0.61 \\lambda}{\\mathrm{NA}}$$\n\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength of the emitted light, and $\\mathrm{NA}$ is the numerical aperture of the objective lens. The problem gives the emission peak wavelength as $\\lambda = 520\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and the numerical aperture as $\\mathrm{NA} = 1.4$.\n\nWe can now evaluate this expression:\n$$d_{xy} = \\frac{0.61 \\times 520\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{1.4}$$\n$$d_{xy} = \\frac{317.2\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{1.4}$$\n$$d_{xy} \\approx 226.5714\\ \\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the lateral resolution is $227\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n**2. Axial (Out-of-Plane) Resolution**\n\nThe axial resolution, $d_z$, describes the minimum resolvable distance between two points along the optical axis ($z$-axis). It is related to the extent of the PSF along this axis, often quantified by its Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM). Compared to the lateral resolution, the axial resolution is considerably poorer.\n\nA common and useful approximation for the axial resolution in wide-field fluorescence microscopy, derived from scalar diffraction theory, is given by:\n\n$$d_z = \\frac{2 n \\lambda}{(\\mathrm{NA})^2}$$\n\nHere, $n$ is the refractive index of the medium between the objective and the specimen (the immersion oil), $\\lambda$ is the vacuum wavelength of light, and $\\mathrm{NA}$ is the numerical aperture. We are given $\\lambda = 520\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 520 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $n = 1.515$, and $\\mathrm{NA} = 1.4$.\n\nWe evaluate the expression for $d_z$:\n$$d_z = \\frac{2 \\times 1.515 \\times (520 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{(1.4)^2}$$\n$$d_z = \\frac{2 \\times 1.515 \\times 520}{1.96} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$d_z = \\frac{1575.6}{1.96} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$d_z \\approx 803.8775... \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe result is approximately $803.9\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The problem requires the axial resolution to be expressed in micrometers ($\\mu$m). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{nm}$, we have:\n$$d_z \\approx 0.8038775...\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\nRounding to three significant figures, the axial resolution is $0.804\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the lateral resolution in nanometers and the axial resolution in micrometers, rounded to three significant figures.\nLateral resolution: $227\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\nAxial resolution: $0.804\\ \\mathrm{\\mu m}$.",
