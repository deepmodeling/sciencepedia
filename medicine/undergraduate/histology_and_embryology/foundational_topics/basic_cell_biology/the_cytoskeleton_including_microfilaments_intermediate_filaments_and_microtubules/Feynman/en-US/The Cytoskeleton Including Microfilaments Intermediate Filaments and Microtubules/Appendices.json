            "introduction": "The cytoskeleton is not a static scaffold but a highly dynamic structure. This dynamism is perfectly illustrated by the phenomenon of actin treadmilling, where a filament can maintain a roughly constant length while exhibiting net polymerization at one end and net depolymerization at the other. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to calculate the growth or shrinkage rates at both ends of an actin filament from first principles, using fundamental kinetic parameters. By working through this problem, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how the free monomer concentration determines whether a filament grows, shrinks, or enters the treadmilling regime .",

            "problem": "Actin filaments exhibit polarized dynamics at their ends: the barbed (plus) end and the pointed (minus) end. In a well-mixed in vitro system containing Globular actin (G-actin), the instantaneous polymerization rate at an end is proportional to the free G-actin concentration, and depolymerization is concentration-independent. Use the following foundational definitions:\n\n- The polymerization rate at an end is $r_{\\text{on}} = k_{\\text{on}}[\\text{A}]$, where $k_{\\text{on}}$ is the second-order association rate constant and $[\\text{A}]$ is the free G-actin concentration.\n- The depolymerization rate at an end is $r_{\\text{off}} = k_{\\text{off}}$, where $k_{\\text{off}}$ is the first-order dissociation rate constant.\n- The net endwise velocity (in subunits per second) at the barbed (plus) end is $v^{+} = r_{\\text{on}}^{+} - r_{\\text{off}}^{+}$, and at the pointed (minus) end is $v^{-} = r_{\\text{on}}^{-} - r_{\\text{off}}^{-}$.\n- The critical concentration at an end is $C_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$ and indicates the threshold of $[\\text{A}]$ at which net growth at that end is zero.\n\nA single actin filament is placed into a solution with $[\\text{G-actin}] = [\\text{A}] = 1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$. The measured kinetic parameters are $k_{\\text{on}}^{+} = 11\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{off}}^{+} = 1.4\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{on}}^{-} = 1.3\\,\\mu\\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $k_{\\text{off}}^{-} = 0.8\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nStarting from the above definitions, determine whether treadmilling occurs at $[\\text{A}] = 1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and, if so, compute the treadmilling velocity and direction for this single filament. In this problem, define the treadmilling velocity $v_{\\text{tm}}$ (in subunits per second) as the steady flux of actin subunits through the filament when one end grows and the other shrinks (that is, when $v^{+} > 0$ and $v^{-}  0$). If both ends grow or both ends shrink, take $v_{\\text{tm}} = 0$ and the direction to be “none.”\n\nUse the following encoding for the direction: $+1$ for flux from the barbed (plus) end toward the pointed (minus) end, $-1$ for flux from the pointed (minus) end toward the barbed (plus) end, and $0$ if no treadmilling occurs. Express the final velocity in subunits per second. Provide the final answer as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} v_{\\text{tm}}  d \\end{pmatrix}$, with no units inside the matrix. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "To determine if treadmilling occurs, we must calculate the net polymerization velocity at both the barbed (plus) and pointed (minus) ends of the actin filament. Treadmilling is defined as the state where one end grows ($v^{+}  0$) while the other shrinks ($v^{-}  0$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the net velocity at the barbed end ($v^{+}$) using the formula $v^{+} = k_{\\text{on}}^{+}[\\text{A}] - k_{\\text{off}}^{+}$.

This situation occurs because the free monomer concentration ($1\\,\\mu\\text{M}$) is above the critical concentration for both ends ($C_{\\text{c}}^{+} \\approx 0.127\\,\\mu\\text{M}$ and $C_{\\text{c}}^{-} \\approx 0.615\\,\\mu\\text{M}$).\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, if both ends grow, the treadmilling velocity $v_{\\text{tm}}$ is 0, and the direction $d$ is also 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is $\\begin{pmatrix} v_{\\text{tm}}  d \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) measures spatially averaged molecular mobility by bleaching fluorophores in a defined region and tracking recovery driven by lateral diffusion and binding/unbinding; it yields diffusion coefficients $D$ and residence times (e.g., off-rates $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$) but does not resolve single-molecule steps. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy uses an evanescent field generated by total internal reflection at a glass–water interface; excitation decays approximately exponentially with depth $z$ and is confined to about $10^2 \\,\\mathrm{nm}$, enabling high signal-to-noise imaging of events at the cell cortex. Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) vitrifies samples and images with electrons to reconstruct near-native structures at nanometer to near-atomic resolution (often on the order of a few $\\mathrm{\\AA}$), providing structural snapshots rather than dynamic rates in live cells. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) detects cantilever deflection to measure forces via $F = k_{\\mathrm{c}} \\Delta x$ and map topography and mechanics (e.g., stiffness, adhesion) at $10^{-12}$–$10^{-9} \\,\\mathrm{N}$ scales on cells and filaments. Optical tweezers trap dielectric beads in a focused laser field by gradient forces, yielding a near-harmonic potential $U \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2} k x^2$; they resolve bead displacements $x$ and forces $F = k x$ to quantify motor step sizes and stall forces in the $1$–$100 \\,\\mathrm{pN}$ range but do not image atomic structure.\n\nB. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) resolves single-molecule step sizes within a bleached spot and provides atomic-resolution localization; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) excites fluorophores throughout several $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ into the cytoplasm using a propagating field, making it ideal for deep-tissue dynamics; Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) measures diffusion rates of filaments in live cells under physiological temperatures; Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) reconstructs atomic structures of proteins in bulk solution with electron beams; Optical tweezers rely solely on radiation pressure and cannot be calibrated to measure forces on cytoskeletal motors.\n\nC.

Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) infers cellular temperature from bleach recovery and is insensitive to diffusion; Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) uses two-photon excitation to generate the evanescent field; Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) requires heavy metal staining to achieve nanometer resolution; Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) generates topographic images only and cannot be used to measure mechanical properties; Optical tweezers provide atomic-resolution imaging of actin filaments in addition to force measurements.",
            "solution": "The problem requires matching five experimental goals with the correct descriptions of the corresponding biophysical techniques and their underlying principles.

FRAP is not a single-molecule or atomic-resolution technique. TIRF uses a shallow evanescent field, not a deep propagating one. Cryo-EM is a static structural method, not for live-cell dynamics. AFM uses a physical probe, not an electron beam. Optical tweezers are based on gradient forces (not just radiation pressure) and are used for force measurement.\n\n**Option C** is incorrect. FRAP is sensitive to mobility and kinetics. TIRF penetration is ~100 nm, not 1-2 µm. Cryo-EM avoids chemical fixation. AFM operates at pN-nN forces, not kN, and is ideal for living cells. Optical tweezers primarily measure linear forces and displacements.\n\n**Option D** is incorrect. FRAP depends on diffusion. Standard TIRF uses single-photon excitation. High-resolution Cryo-EM avoids heavy metal staining. AFM is a primary tool for measuring mechanical properties. Optical tweezers are not an atomic-resolution imaging technique.\n\nTherefore, Option A is the only choice where all five descriptions are scientifically accurate.",

            "problem": "A key morphogenetic process in early embryonic development is convergent extension, in which polarized actomyosin activity within epithelial and mesenchymal cells drives neighbor exchanges (cell intercalations) that elongate the body axis. Consider a simplified one-dimensional axis of length $L(t)$ that behaves as a viscous continuum on developmental timescales. Use the following fundamental bases and modeling assumptions:\n\n- Kinematics of axial extension: the axial strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$ relates to the axis length by $\\frac{dL}{dt} = \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\,L(t)$.\n- Well-tested observation in tissue mechanics: on long timescales embryonic tissues flow as viscous media, and actomyosin-driven intercalation provides an effective, approximately steady axial strain rate.\n- Constitutive closure for active remodeling: assume the mean axial strain rate is proportional to the product of the cell intercalation rate and the average junctional actomyosin tension, normalized by a reference tension.
