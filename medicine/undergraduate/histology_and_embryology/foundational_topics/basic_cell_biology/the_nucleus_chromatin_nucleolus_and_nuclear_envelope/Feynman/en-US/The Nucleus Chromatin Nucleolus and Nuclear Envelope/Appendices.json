The values provided for DNA axial rise, nucleosome repeat length, and the dimensions of chromatin fibers are standard, accepted approximations used in molecular biology and biophysics. The use of simplified models (beads-on-a-string, solenoid) is explicitly stated and is a common, valid pedagogical approach. The problem does not violate any scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The quantity to be calculated (compaction ratio) is clearly defined. All necessary parameters and definitions required for the calculation are provided. The instructions for calculating the \"fiber contour length\" in each case are explicit and unambiguous, ensuring that a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem exhibits no flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. It is a formalizable and solvable quantitative problem based on standard models in its field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived as follows.\n\nThe compaction ratio, $C$, is defined as the contour length of the DNA, $L_{\\text{DNA}}$, divided by the contour length of the chromatin fiber, $L_{\\text{fiber}}$, for a given segment of genetic material. We will consider a single nucleosome repeat as our unit.\n$$C = \\frac{L_{\\text{DNA}}}{L_{\\text{fiber}}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the contour length of the DNA within one nucleosome repeat, $L_{\\text{DNA,rep}}$. The nucleosome repeat length is given as $N_{rep} = 200\\,\\mathrm{bp}$, and the axial rise per base pair for B-form DNA is $L_{bp} = 0.34\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ L_{\\text{DNA,rep}} = N_{rep} \\times L_{bp} = (200\\,\\mathrm{bp}) \\times (0.34\\,\\mathrm{nm}/\\mathrm{bp}) = 68\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe information that $147\\,\\mathrm{bp}$ wrap the histone core is contextual and not required for the calculation as formulated, which depends only on the total repeat length.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Compaction Ratio for the $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ Fiber ($C_{10}$)**\n\nFor the beads-on-a-string or $10\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ fiber, the problem defines the contour length of the fiber per nucleosome repeat, $L_{\\text{fiber},10}$, as the center-to-center spacing of adjacent nucleosomes, given as $d_c = 11\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ L_{\\text{fiber},10} = 11\\,\\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe compaction ratio $C_{10}$ is therefore the ratio of the DNA contour length per repeat to this fiber length per repeat.\n$$ C_{10} = \\frac{L_{\\text{DNA,rep}}}{L_{\\text{fiber},10}} = \\frac{68\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{11\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{68}{11} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ C_{10} \\approx 6.181818... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $C_{10} \\approx 6.18$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Compaction Ratio for the $30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ Fiber ($C_{30}$)**\n\nFor the H1-stabilized $30\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ fiber, the problem models it as a solenoid. The contour length of the fiber per nucleosome repeat, $L_{\\text{fiber},30}$, is defined as the \"axial rise per nucleosome\". This is given by the pitch of the solenoid, $p$, divided by the number of nucleosomes per turn, $n$.\nGiven values are $p = 11\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $n = 6$.\n$$ L_{\\text{fiber},30} = \\frac{p}{n} = \\frac{11\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{6} $$\nThe total compaction ratio $C_{30}$ from naked DNA to this fiber is the ratio of the same DNA contour length, $L_{\\text{DNA,rep}}$, to this new fiber length.\n$$ C_{30} = \\frac{L_{\\text{DNA,rep}}}{L_{\\text{fiber},30}} = \\frac{68\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{(11/6)\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{68 \\times 6}{11} = \\frac{408}{11} $$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$ C_{30} \\approx 37.090909... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $C_{30} \\approx 37.1$.\n\nThe final answers are the calculated values for $C_{10}$ and $C_{30}$, rounded to three significant figures.",
