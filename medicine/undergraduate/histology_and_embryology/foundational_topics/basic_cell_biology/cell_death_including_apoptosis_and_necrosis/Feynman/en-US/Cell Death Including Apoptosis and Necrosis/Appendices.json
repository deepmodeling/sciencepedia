            "problem": "A histology practicum asks you to justify how specific tissue environments and molecular processes shape the dominant morphologic pattern of necrosis. Starting from core principles that necrosis features loss of plasma membrane integrity, enzymatic digestion of cellular components, and an ensuing inflammatory response, and that the observed pattern depends on whether protein denaturation or enzymatic hydrolysis predominates, match each named necrosis pattern to a prototypical tissue context with a mechanism consistent with those principles. Which option most accurately aligns all five patterns with their prototypical contexts and mechanisms?\n\nA. Coagulative: myocardial infarction with ischemia leading to protein denaturation and architectural preservation; Liquefactive: pyogenic bacterial abscess with neutrophil hydrolases digesting tissue; Caseous: ischemic infarct of the cerebrum due to lipid dissolution; Fat: tuberculous granuloma due to macrophage activation; Fibrinoid: immune complex–mediated vasculitis with deposition of antigen–antibody complexes and fibrin in vessel walls\n\nB. Coagulative: renal cortical or myocardial infarct where ischemia causes protein denaturation to exceed enzymatic proteolysis, preserving outlines; Liquefactive: cerebral infarct or bacterial abscess where high hydrolytic enzyme activity and cellular debris convert tissue into a viscous liquid; Caseous: pulmonary tuberculosis granuloma with T helper 1–driven macrophage activation producing amorphous, granular debris and tissue architecture loss; Fat: acute pancreatitis with lipase-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis and calcium soap formation in peripancreatic adipose; Fibrinoid: immune-mediated vasculitis or severe hypertension injuring vessel walls, allowing immune complexes and plasma proteins including fibrin to deposit and produce bright eosinophilic fibrinoid change\n\nC.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Core principles of necrosis:\n  1. Loss of plasma membrane integrity.\n  2. Enzymatic digestion of cellular components.\n  3. Ensuing inflammatory response.\n- The dominant morphologic pattern of necrosis depends on whether protein denaturation or enzymatic hydrolysis predominates.\n- The task is to match five named necrosis patterns to a prototypical tissue context and a consistent mechanism.\n- The five patterns are: Coagulative, Liquefactive, Caseous, Fat, and Fibrinoid.\n- The question asks to identify the option that most accurately aligns all five patterns with their contexts and mechanisms.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental and universally accepted principles of general pathology concerning cell death. The definitions provided, the causal link between molecular processes (denaturation vs. hydrolysis) and morphological patterns, and the five specific types of necrosis are all standard, core concepts in histology and pathology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is a well-defined matching task. It requests the identification of the single best option that correctly aligns five distinct pathological patterns with their corresponding etiologies, mechanisms, and tissue contexts. A unique and correct answer exists within the established framework of medical science.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise and technical. The descriptions of pathological processes are based on objective, observable microscopic and macroscopic findings. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary foundational principles to evaluate the options. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be derived based on these established principles.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Alignments\n\nBased on the provided principles and established knowledge in pathology, the correct alignments are derived as follows:\n\n1.  **Coagulative Necrosis**: This pattern arises when protein denaturation is the dominant process, overshadowing enzymatic digestion. This is characteristic of hypoxic cell death (ischemia) in most solid organs, with the notable exception of the brain. The lack of blood supply and subsequent acidosis denature not only structural proteins but also lytic enzymes, thus preserving the ghostly outlines of the dead cells and the overall tissue architecture for a period. Prototypical examples include myocardial infarcts and renal infarcts.\n\n2.  **Liquefactive Necrosis**: This pattern occurs when enzymatic digestion predominates. There are two primary contexts:\n    a) In focal bacterial or fungal infections, the recruitment of large numbers of inflammatory cells (primarily neutrophils) results in the release of potent hydrolytic enzymes. These enzymes digest the dead cells and surrounding tissue, transforming the area into a liquid, viscous mass known as pus, forming an abscess.\n    b) In the central nervous system (CNS), ischemic injury (e.g., stroke) leads to liquefactive necrosis. The brain is rich in hydrolytic enzymes and lipids and lacks a substantial fibrous stroma. Upon cell death, autolysis and enzymatic digestion prevail, leading to the liquefaction of the necrotic tissue.\n\n3.  **Caseous Necrosis**: This pattern is a distinctive form of necrosis, classically associated with tuberculosis. It is a feature of granulomatous inflammation. The term \"caseous\" means \"cheese-like,\" referring to the friable, white-yellow gross appearance of the necrotic area. Microscopically, it appears as eosinophilic, amorphous, granular debris, with a complete loss of cellular detail and tissue architecture. It is thought to result from the host's immune response, particularly involving activated macrophages (driven by T helper 1 cells), which fail to completely digest the mycobacteria and cellular debris, partly due to the lipid-rich capsule of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.\n\n4.  **Fat Necrosis**: This refers to focal areas of fat destruction. The classic example is in acute pancreatitis, where leakage of pancreatic lipases into the peripancreatic adipose tissue and the peritoneal cavity digests the cell membranes of fat cells. The enzymes hydrolyze the triglyceride esters contained within, releasing fatty acids. These fatty acids then combine with calcium ions in a process called saponification, forming chalky-white calcium soaps that are visible macroscopically and histologically as basophilic deposits. It can also be caused by trauma to fatty tissues like the breast.\n\n5.  **Fibrinoid Necrosis**: This is a special form of necrosis typically seen in blood vessel walls. It is not defined by the cell death pattern but by the deposition of a specific material. It occurs in contexts of severe vascular injury, such as immune-mediated vasculitis (e.g., type III hypersensitivity reactions where antigen-antibody complexes are deposited in vessel walls) and malignant hypertension. Plasma proteins, including fibrin, leak through the damaged endothelium and deposit within the vessel wall, creating a bright pink, amorphous appearance on H&E stain that is termed \"fibrinoid.\"\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Coagulative: myocardial infarction with ischemia leading to protein denaturation and architectural preservation; Liquefactive: pyogenic bacterial abscess with neutrophil hydrolases digesting tissue; Caseous: ischemic infarct of the cerebrum due to lipid dissolution; Fat: tuberculous granuloma due to macrophage activation; Fibrinoid: immune complex–mediated vasculitis with deposition of antigen–antibody complexes and fibrin in vessel walls**\n\n- **Coagulative**: Correct. This is the classic example and mechanism.\n- **Liquefactive**: Correct. This is a classic example and mechanism.\n- **Caseous**: Incorrect. An ischemic infarct of the cerebrum causes *liquefactive* necrosis. Caseous necrosis is characteristic of granulomas (e.g., tuberculosis).\n- **Fat**: Incorrect. A tuberculous granuloma is the site of *caseous* necrosis. Fat necrosis involves lipase activity.\n- **Fibrinoid**: Correct. This is the classic example and mechanism.\n- **Verdict**: This option is **Incorrect** due to the mischaracterization of caseous and fat necrosis.\n\n**B. Coagulative: renal cortical or myocardial infarct where ischemia causes protein denaturation to exceed enzymatic proteolysis, preserving outlines; Liquefactive: cerebral infarct or bacterial abscess where high hydrolytic enzyme activity and cellular debris convert tissue into a viscous liquid; Caseous: pulmonary tuberculosis granuloma with T helper 1–driven macrophage activation producing amorphous, granular debris and tissue architecture loss; Fat: acute pancreatitis with lipase-mediated triglyceride hydrolysis and calcium soap formation in peripancreatic adipose; Fibrinoid: immune-mediated vasculitis or severe hypertension injuring vessel walls, allowing immune complexes and plasma proteins including fibrin to deposit and produce bright eosinophilic fibrinoid change**\n\n- **Coagulative**: Correct. Accurately describes the mechanism and provides classic examples.\n- **Liquefactive**: Correct. Accurately identifies both primary contexts (cerebral infarct and abscess) and the correct underlying principle.\n- **Caseous**: Correct. Provides the classic context (pulmonary tuberculosis), the correct immunologic mechanism (T helper 1–driven macrophage activation), and the accurate morphologic description.\n- **Fat**: Correct. Perfectly describes the mechanism (lipase-mediated hydrolysis and saponification) in the classic context of acute pancreatitis.\n- **Fibrinoid**: Correct. Accurately lists both major causes (immune vasculitis, severe hypertension) and the specific histologic finding.\n- **Verdict**: This option is **Correct** as all five alignments are accurate and detailed.\n\n**C. Coagulative: brain infarct where lipid-rich tissue liquefies after ischemia; Liquefactive: splenic infarct where protein denaturation preserves architecture; Caseous: enzymatic fat necrosis in peripancreatic adipose after pancreatitis; Fat: immune complex–mediated vasculitis with fibrin deposition in vessel walls; Fibrinoid: tumor cores undergoing hypoxia with protein denaturation**\n\n- **Coagulative**: Incorrect. This describes liquefactive necrosis in the brain.\n- **Liquefactive**: Incorrect. This describes coagulative necrosis. A splenic infarct is a classic example of coagulative necrosis.\n- **Caseous**: Incorrect. This describes fat necrosis.\n- **Fat**: Incorrect. This describes fibrinoid necrosis.\n- **Fibrinoid**: Incorrect. Hypoxia in a tumor core typically causes coagulative necrosis.\n- **Verdict**: This option is **Incorrect** as all five associations are scrambled and wrong.\n\n**D. Coagulative: hepatic abscess with neutrophil enzymes digesting tissue into pus; Liquefactive: renal cortical infarct where ischemia preserves cellular outlines; Caseous: fungal hyphae colonizing adipose causing saponification; Fat: traumatic soft tissue contusion causing fibrin deposition in vessel walls; Fibrinoid: intraluminal thrombosis of veins with clot organization and recanalization producing fibrinoid appearance**\n\n- **Coagulative**: Incorrect. A hepatic abscess with pus formation is a classic example of liquefactive necrosis.\n- **Liquefactive**: Incorrect. A renal infarct with preserved outlines is a classic example of coagulative necrosis.\n- **Caseous**: Incorrect. Saponification is characteristic of fat necrosis. While some fungal infections can cause caseous necrosis within granulomas, the described mechanism is wrong.\n- **Fat**: Incorrect. Fibrin deposition in vessel walls is characteristic of fibrinoid necrosis, not fat necrosis. While trauma can cause fat necrosis, the mechanism described is incorrect.\n- **Fibrinoid**: Incorrect. This describes the organization of a thrombus *within the lumen* of a vessel. Fibrinoid necrosis is the deposition of fibrinoid material *in the vessel wall itself*.\n- **Verdict**: This option is **Incorrect** as all five associations are flawed.",

            "problem": "A hepatology laboratory receives a liver biopsy from a patient who experienced combined hypoxic injury and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. The pathologist examines Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained sections and performs Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling (TUNEL) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cleaved caspase-3 on adjacent sections. Two regions of interest are defined: Region 1 (peri-central) and Region 2 (peri-portal). In each region, the observer manually counts $n=200$ hepatocytes and records the following:\n\n- Region 1 (peri-central): H&E shows enlarged, pale hepatocytes with cytoplasmic swelling, loss of nuclear basophilia, ghost-like cells, and areas where nuclei are absent or show fading (karyolysis).

The described morphological features (cell swelling vs. shrinkage, karyolysis vs. pyknosis/karyorrhexis), the associated inflammatory response (neutrophils vs. minimal infiltrate), and the molecular markers (cleaved caspase-3 as a marker for apoptosis, TUNEL for DNA fragmentation) are all standard and textbook concepts for distinguishing necrosis and apoptosis. The clinical context (hypoxic and drug-induced liver injury) is a plausible scenario for observing both types of cell death, often with zonal distribution (necrosis being common in the oxygen-poor peri-central zone). The data is internally consistent and aligns with established scientific facts.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly structured. It provides two distinct data sets (Region 1 and Region 2) that exemplify the two processes (necrosis and apoptosis, respectively), gives the canonical definitions for each, and asks for a synthesis of these observations into a set of distinguishing criteria. A unique, correct conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and descriptive, free from subjectivity or ambiguity. The quantitative data (e.g., $20\\%$, $75\\%$) serve to illustrate qualitative differences (low vs. high expression) and are presented objectively.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. There are no identifiable flaws. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Criteria and Evaluation of Options\n\nFirst, we will deduce the type of cell death occurring in each region based on the provided definitions and observations.\n\n**Analysis of Region 1 (peri-central):**\n- **H&E Morphology**: Cell swelling, cytoplasmic pallor, loss of membrane integrity (\"indistinct borders\"), and nuclear dissolution (\"karyolysis\") are classic signs of oncosis leading to necrosis. The injury affects groups of cells (\"confluent areas\"), and the presence of neutrophils indicates an inflammatory response. This entire picture aligns perfectly with the provided definition of necrosis.\n- **Molecular Markers**: The absence of significant cleaved caspase-3 staining (mostly negative, with only ~$5\\%$ faint staining) indicates that the primary caspase-driven apoptotic pathway is not activated. The weak, patchy TUNEL signal, particularly in extracellular debris, is characteristic of the random and post-lytic DNA degradation that occurs during necrosis, contrasting sharply with the organized fragmentation in apoptosis.\n- **Conclusion for Region 1**: The findings are overwhelmingly characteristic of **necrosis**.\n\n**Analysis of Region 2 (peri-portal):**\n- **H&E Morphology**: Cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, chromatin condensation (\"pyknosis\"), and nuclear fragmentation (\"karyorrhexis\") into apoptotic bodies are the cardinal morphological features of apoptosis. The process affects single, scattered cells while maintaining the overall tissue architecture and a lack of significant inflammation. This aligns perfectly with the provided definition of apoptosis.\n- **Molecular Markers**: The robust cleaved caspase-3 positivity (~$75\\%$ of affected cells) provides direct molecular evidence of the activation of the executioner caspase cascade, a central event in apoptosis. The strong, discrete nuclear TUNEL signal corresponds to the orderly internucleosomal DNA cleavage by caspase-activated DNases, another hallmark of apoptosis.\n- **Conclusion for Region 2**: The findings are unequivocally characteristic of **apoptosis**.\n\n**Integrating the criteria:**\n- **Apoptosis** is defined by: single-cell death, cell shrinkage, cytoplasmic eosinophilia, nuclear pyknosis/karyorrhexis, formation of apoptotic bodies, maintained membrane integrity (initially), minimal inflammation, positive cleaved caspase-3, and strong, discrete nuclear TUNEL signal. This matches the findings in Region 2.\n- **Necrosis** is defined by: death of confluent cell groups, cell swelling, loss of membrane integrity, nuclear karyolysis, robust inflammation, negative or minimal cleaved caspase-3, and weak/diffuse/extracellular TUNEL signal. This matches the findings in Region 1.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against these derived criteria.\n\n**A. Apoptosis is identified by single-cell shrinkage with intact membranes, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation into apoptotic bodies on H&E, strong, discrete nuclear TUNEL signal, and cleaved caspase-3 positivity in the affected cells, with minimal inflammation; necrosis is identified by cell swelling, loss of nuclear basophilia with karyolysis, confluent zones of injury, weak or patchy TUNEL in debris, and absent cleaved caspase-3, accompanied by neutrophilic infiltration.**\n- This option accurately summarizes the criteria for apoptosis consistent with the findings in Region 2 and the general definition.\n- It also accurately summarizes the criteria for necrosis consistent with the findings in Region 1 and the general definition.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Apoptosis is identified by cell swelling, ghost cells, diffuse cytoplasmic TUNEL signal, and absence of cleaved caspase-3; necrosis is identified by cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation with strong nuclear TUNEL signal, and cleaved caspase-3 positivity in the injured cells.**\n- This option incorrectly assigns the features of necrosis (Region 1 observations) to apoptosis.\n- It incorrectly assigns the features of apoptosis (Region 2 observations) to necrosis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The descriptions for apoptosis and necrosis are swapped.\n\n**C. Apoptosis is identified by confluent zones of injury with robust neutrophilic inflammation, negative TUNEL because DNA remains intact, yet cleaved caspase-3 is positive; necrosis is identified by scattered single-cell injury with nuclear condensation and fragmentation, negative cleaved caspase-3, and strong nuclear TUNEL signal.**\n- The description of apoptosis is a contradictory mix of features. Confluent injury and neutrophils are signs of necrosis. TUNEL is typically positive in apoptosis, not negative.\n- The description of necrosis is also a contradictory mix. Single-cell injury with nuclear fragmentation is apoptotic morphology. A strong nuclear TUNEL signal is also characteristic of apoptosis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option presents a factually incorrect and illogical combination of features for both processes.\n\n**D. Apoptosis is identified by cell shrinkage and apoptotic bodies, cleaved caspase-3 positivity, and strong nuclear TUNEL signal; necrosis is identified by cell swelling and karyolysis with strong nuclear TUNEL and frequent cleaved caspase-3 positivity due to secondary necrosis, together with neutrophilic inflammation.**\n- The description of apoptosis is correct.\n- The description of necrosis, however, claims \"strong nuclear TUNEL and frequent cleaved caspase-3 positivity.\" This directly contradicts the specific experimental data provided for Region 1, which showed \"weak, patchy\" TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 that was \"negative in most cells.\" While the concept of secondary necrosis exists, the proposed criteria in this option do not match the observed data for the necrotic region in this specific problem.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The characterization of necrosis is inconsistent with the data provided in the problem statement for Region 1.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a completely accurate and integrated set of criteria that is consistent with both the fundamental definitions of apoptosis and necrosis and the specific experimental findings described in the problem.",

Proliferation generates new cells through the cell cycle, while apoptosis and necrosis remove cells through programmed cell death and catastrophic membrane failure, respectively. Let $N(t)$ denote the number of living cells at time $t$, and assume that the culture is sufficiently homogeneous that per-capita event rates can be treated as constants over defined intervals. Specifically, let $p$ be the per-capita proliferation rate, $a$ be the per-capita apoptosis rate, and $n$ be the per-capita necrosis rate.

It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Model Derivation and Analysis\nThe rate of change of the cell population, $dN(t)/dt$, is governed by the principle of mass balance: the rate of gain minus the rate of loss.\n\nThe gain in cell number is due to proliferation. Based on the assumption of first-order kinetics, the total proliferation rate is the per-capita rate $p$ multiplied by the number of cells $N(t)$, giving a gain term of $p N(t)$.\n\nThe loss in cell number is due to both apoptosis and necrosis. The total apoptosis rate is the per-capita rate $a$ multiplied by $N(t)$, giving a loss term of $a N(t)$. Similarly, the total necrosis rate gives a loss term of $n N(t)$.\n\nCombining these terms, the governing ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = p N(t) - a N(t) - n N(t)\n$$\nThis can be simplified by factoring out $N(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = (p - a - n) N(t)\n$$\nLet us define the net rate parameter, $k$, as $k = p - a - n$. The ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = k N(t)\n$$\nEquilibrium states, denoted as $N^*$, are found by setting the rate of change to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = 0\n$$\n$$\nk N^* = 0\n$$\nThis equation has the single solution $N^* = 0$, which represents the extinction of the cell population. This is the only equilibrium state for any non-zero $k$. If $k=0$, any population size is an equilibrium.\n\nThe stability of the equilibrium state $N^* = 0$ is determined by the sign of the net rate parameter $k$. We can analyze the behavior of a small perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ from the equilibrium, where $N(t) = N^* + \\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(t)$. The linearized equation for the perturbation is $\\frac{d\\epsilon}{dt} = k\\epsilon$, which has the solution $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0) \\exp(kt)$.\n- If $k > 0$ (i.e., $p > a + n$), the exponent is positive. Any small perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ will grow exponentially, causing the population to move away from $N^*=0$. The equilibrium is **unstable**. This corresponds to net population growth.\n- If $k < 0$ (i.e., $p < a + n$), the exponent is negative. Any small perturbation $\\epsilon(t)$ will decay to zero, causing the population to return to $N^*=0$. The equilibrium is **stable**. This corresponds to net population decline towards extinction.\n- If $k = 0$ (i.e., $p = a + n$), the perturbation remains constant, $\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon(0)$. The system is **neutrally stable**.\n\n### Piecewise Solution for $N(24)$\nThe general solution to the ODE $\\frac{dN}{dt} = kN$ with an initial condition $N(t_0) = N_0$ is found by separating variables and integrating:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{dN'}{N'} = \\int_{t_0}^{t} k \\,dt' \\implies \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = k(t-t_0)\n$$\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(k(t-t_0))\n$$\n\n**Interval 1: $t \\in [0, 12]$ hours**\nThe initial condition is $N(0) = 1.0 \\times 10^6$ cells.\nThe rates are $p_1 = 0.04$, $a_1 = 0.01$, and $n_1 = 0.005$, all in units of $\\text{hour}^{-1}$.\nThe net rate for this interval is:\n$$\nk_1 = p_1 - a_1 - n_1 = 0.04 - 0.01 - 0.005 = 0.025 \\text{ hour}^{-1}\n$$\nThe population at time $t$ during this interval is given by $N(t) = N(0) \\exp(k_1 t)$. We compute the population at $t = 12$ hours:\n$$\nN(12) = N(0) \\exp(k_1 \\times 12) = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp(0.025 \\times 12)\n$$\n$$\nN(12) = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp(0.3)\n$$\n\n**Interval 2: $t \\in (12, 24]$ hours**\nThe initial condition for this interval is $N(12)$, the final population from the previous interval. The duration of this interval is $24 - 12 = 12$ hours.\nThe rates are $p_2 = 0.015$, $a_2 = 0.03$, and $n_2 = 0.005$, all in units of $\\text{hour}^{-1}$.\nThe net rate for this interval is:\n$$\nk_2 = p_2 - a_2 - n_2 = 0.015 - 0.03 - 0.005 = -0.02 \\text{ hour}^{-1}\n$$\nThe population at time $t$ during this interval is given by $N(t) = N(12) \\exp(k_2 (t-12))$. We need to find the population at $t = 24$ hours:\n$$\nN(24) = N(12) \\exp(k_2 (24-12)) = N(12) \\exp(k_2 \\times 12)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N(12)$:\n$$\nN(24) = \\left[ (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp(k_1 \\times 12) \\right] \\exp(k_2 \\times 12)\n$$\n$$\nN(24) = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp((k_1 + k_2) \\times 12)\n$$\nNow, substitute the numerical values for the rates:\n$$\nk_1 + k_2 = 0.025 + (-0.02) = 0.005 \\text{ hour}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nN(24) = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp(0.005 \\times 12) = (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\exp(0.06)\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(0.06) \\approx 1.0618365465\n$$\n$$\nN(24) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\times 1.0618365465 = 1061836.5465 \\text{ cells}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nN(24) \\approx 1.062 \\times 10^6 \\text{ cells}\n$$",
