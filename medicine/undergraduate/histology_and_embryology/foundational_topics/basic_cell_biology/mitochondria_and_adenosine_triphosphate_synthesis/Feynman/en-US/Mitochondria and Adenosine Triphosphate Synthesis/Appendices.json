The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following definitions and conditions for the F1Fo-ATP synthase:\n1.  The catalytic F1 sector has three catalytic sites.\n2.  The F1 sector produces exactly one ATP molecule for each $1/3$ turn of the central stalk.\n3.  The F1 sector yields exactly $3$ ATP molecules per full revolution of the central stalk.\n4.  The Fo sector contains a ring of $n_c$ identical $c$-subunits.\n5.  Each $c$-subunit is associated with the translocation of exactly one proton ($H^{+}$) per cycle.\n6.  One full revolution of the $c$-ring is driven by the translocation of exactly $n_c$ protons.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for its validity.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a simplified but standard and widely accepted model of the F1Fo-ATP synthase, a central enzyme in cellular bioenergetics. The mechanism described, coupling proton flow to mechanical rotation and subsequent ATP synthesis, is the core of the chemiosmotic theory. The parameters given, such as $3$ ATP per revolution and a variable number of $c$-subunits ($n_c$), are consistent with current biochemical literature. For instance, the $c$-ring stoichiometry of $n_c=8$ is found in vertebrate mitochondria, while $n_c=10$ is characteristic of yeast mitochondria. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem asks for the derivation of a specific ratio and its evaluation for given parameters. The information provided is sufficient to establish a clear stoichiometric relationship between proton translocation and ATP synthesis. The question is unambiguous and leads to a unique solution.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of any subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem is self-contained and internally consistent. Point 3 is a direct consequence of point 2 ($1 \\text{ ATP} / (1/3 \\text{ turn}) = 3 \\text{ ATP} / (1 \\text{ turn})$). The F1 and Fo sectors are part of a single complex, where the rotation of the $c$-ring in Fo is mechanically coupled to the rotation of the central stalk in F1. This ensures that a \"full revolution\" is a common reference for both proton translocation and ATP synthesis. The problem statement is therefore valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\n**Derivation of the general expression for the $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio**\n\nThe F1Fo-ATP synthase functions as a rotary motor. The rotation of the central components (the $c$-ring and the attached central stalk) couples two distinct processes: the flow of protons across the membrane and the synthesis of ATP. We can determine the ratio of protons required per ATP synthesized by considering the stoichiometry of each process over one full revolution of the rotor.\n\nLet one full revolution be a rotation of $360$ degrees or $2\\pi$ radians.\n\nFrom the problem statement, one full revolution of the $c$-ring is driven by the translocation of $n_c$ protons. Let $N_{H^+}$ be the number of protons translocated per revolution.\n$$N_{H^+} = n_c$$\n\nAlso from the problem statement, one full revolution of the central stalk results in the synthesis of exactly $3$ ATP molecules. Let $N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ be the number of ATP molecules synthesized per revolution.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 3$$\n\nSince the $c$-ring and the central stalk are mechanically coupled and rotate together, a full revolution of one corresponds to a full revolution of the other. Therefore, we can directly relate the number of protons translocated to the number of ATP molecules synthesized over this common event of one full revolution.\n\nThe proton requirement per ATP, denoted by the ratio $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$, is the total number of protons translocated divided by the total number of ATP molecules synthesized during the same process interval (one revolution).\n\n$$\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{N_{H^+}}{N_{\\mathrm{ATP}}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}} = \\frac{n_c}{3}$$\nThis is the general expression for the proton-to-ATP ratio as a function of the number of $c$-subunits, $n_c$.\n\n**Evaluation for $n_c = 8$ and $n_c = 10$**\n\nThe problem requires the evaluation of this expression for two specific cases.\n\nFor a $c$-ring with $n_c = 8$ (as in vertebrates):\n$$\\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{8}{3}$$\n\nFor a $c$-ring with $n_c = 10$ (as in yeast):\n$$\\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{10}{3}$$\n\nThese are the proton costs for synthesizing one molecule of ATP in each respective system. They are requested as exact fractions.\n\n**Computation of the fold-change in ATP generated per proton**\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for the fold-change in ATP generated per proton, which is a measure of the relative efficiency of ATP synthesis. This is the ratio of the $\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}$ ratios for the two systems.\n\nThe quantity \"ATP generated per proton\" is the reciprocal of the $H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}$ ratio.\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}} = \\left(\\frac{H^{+}}{\\mathrm{ATP}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{3}{n_c}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate this efficiency for each system.\nFor $n_c = 8$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\n\nFor $n_c = 10$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n\nThe problem requires the fold-change, defined as the ratio $\\left(\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}\\right)_{n_c=8} \\big/ \\left(\\mathrm{ATP}/H^{+}\\right)_{n_c=10}$.\n\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=8}}{\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{ATP}}{H^{+}}\\right)_{n_c=10}} = \\frac{3/8}{3/10}$$\n\nWe can simplify this complex fraction:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{3}{8} \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{30}{24}$$\n\nReducing the fraction to its simplest form by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $6$:\n$$\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nThis result indicates that an ATP synthase with an $8$-subunit $c$-ring is more efficient, producing $5/4$ (or $1.25$) times as much ATP per proton as one with a $10$-subunit $c$-ring.\n\nThe three requested results, in order, are:\n1.  $\\left(H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}\\right)_{n_c=8} = \\frac{8}{3}$\n2.  $\\left(H^{+}/\\mathrm{ATP}\\right)_{n_c=10} = \\frac{10}{3}$\n3.

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objectively stated. It represents a valid application of bioenergetic principles. Therefore, a full analysis will be performed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF THE SOLUTION\n\nThe central principle guiding the system's behavior is the steady-state proton flux balance. At steady state, the rate at which protons are pumped into the intermembrane space must equal the rate at which they flow back into the matrix. The problem provides the equation:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + J_{\\mathrm{leak}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the leak flux, we get:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + g_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta p\n$$\nWe are given the following functional dependencies:\n1.  $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$ is a decreasing function of $\\Delta p$. A higher proton motive force creates a larger \"back pressure\" that makes it energetically more difficult for the ETC to pump more protons.\n2.  $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$ is an increasing function of $\\Delta p$. A higher proton motive force provides a greater thermodynamic driving force for the F$_1$F$_o$-ATP synthase to synthesize ATP.\n3.  The term $g_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta p$ is also an increasing function of $\\Delta p$ for any non-zero conductance $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of increasing the proton leak conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$. We can visualize the steady-state solution as the intersection of two curves plotted against $\\Delta p$:\n- The \"proton supply\" curve: $S(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$, which is a downward-sloping curve.\n- The \"proton consumption\" curve: $C(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + g_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta p$, which is an upward-sloping curve (as it is the sum of two increasing functions).\n\nThe steady-state $\\Delta p$ is the value where $S(\\Delta p) = C(\\Delta p)$.\n\nWhen $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ increases to a new value $g'_{\\mathrm{leak}} > g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$, the supply curve $S(\\Delta p)$ remains unchanged because it depends only on the properties of the ETC. However, the consumption curve changes to $C'(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + g'_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\Delta p$. For any $\\Delta p > 0$, $C'(\\Delta p) > C(\\Delta p)$. This means the entire consumption curve shifts upwards.\n\nGiven a downward-sloping supply curve and an upward-sloping consumption curve that has shifted up, their new intersection point must occur at a lower value of $\\Delta p$.\nTherefore, an increase in $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ causes the steady-state $\\Delta p$ to decrease.\n\nNow we can determine the consequences for the individual fluxes:\n- **ATP Synthesis Flux ($J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$)**: Since $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$ is an increasing function of $\\Delta p$, and $\\Delta p$ has decreased, the flux through ATP synthase, $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, must also **decrease**.\n- **Proton Pumping Flux ($J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$)**: Since $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$ is a decreasing function of $\\Delta p$, and $\\Delta p$ has decreased, the relief of backpressure causes the flux through the ETC pumps, $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$, to **increase**. This corresponds to an increased rate of respiration (e.g., oxygen consumption).\n- **Efficiency**: The efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is the ratio of ATP synthesized to substrate oxidized. It can be represented as being proportional to $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}} / J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ decreases and $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ increases, the efficiency must **decrease**.\n- **Heat Production**: The energy from the proton circuit that is not used for ATP synthesis is dissipated as heat. The total energy flow is related to $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ increases while the portion used for ATP synthesis ($J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$) decreases, a larger amount of energy is dissipated through the leak pathway, leading to an **increase** in heat production.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Increasing proton leak conductance $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ dissipates both $\\Delta \\psi$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, thereby reducing the total proton motive force $\\Delta p$.**\nAn increased proton leak conductance provides a pathway for protons to flow from the intermembrane space back to the matrix, down their electrochemical gradient. This flow of positive charge reduces the charge separation across the membrane, thus lowering the electrical potential difference $\\Delta \\psi$. It also transports protons into the alkaline matrix, reducing the pH difference across the membrane, thus lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$. Since the total proton motive force $\\Delta p$ is composed of these two components ($\\Delta p = \\Delta \\psi - \\frac{RT}{F}\\Delta\\mathrm{pH}$, with appropriate sign conventions for the gradients), a reduction in both will necessarily lead to a reduction in the total $\\Delta p$. This aligns perfectly with our derivation which showed that a higher $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ leads to a lower steady-state $\\Delta p$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. At steady state with fixed electron transport properties and fixed ADP availability, increasing proton leak necessarily increases ATP synthase flux $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ because the enzyme spins faster to compensate.**\nOur analysis showed that increasing proton leak reduces the steady-state $\\Delta p$. The ATP synthase flux, $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$, is explicitly stated to be an increasing function of $\\Delta p$. Therefore, a lower $\\Delta p$ results in a lower driving force for the synthase, causing it to operate more slowly, not faster. The flux $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ decreases. The notion of compensation by a single enzyme in response to a reduced driving force is thermodynamically and kinetically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. If $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ increases, the steady-state condition $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p) = J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p) + g_{\\mathrm{leak}} \\, \\Delta p$ implies a lower $\\Delta p$ and a lower $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$, provided $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$ decreases with $\\Delta p$ and $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}(\\Delta p)$ increases with $\\Delta p$.**\nThis statement is a direct and precise summary of the conclusions from the formal analysis of the steady-state equation. As derived above, increasing $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ shifts the total proton consumption curve upward. Given that the proton supply curve ($J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$) is downward sloping, the new equilibrium is established at a lower value of $\\Delta p$. Since $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ is an increasing function of $\\Delta p$, a lower $\\Delta p$ directly implies a lower $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$. The statement is a correct logical consequence of the model's premises.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. In brown adipose tissue expressing UCP1, a large proton leak reduces $\\Delta p$, increasing heat production and reducing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation; the rate of ATP synthesis tends to decrease unless respiratory capacity is upregulated to offset the leak.**\nThis statement applies the general principles to the specific physiological case of UCP1-mediated uncoupling in brown fat.\n- \"a large proton leak reduces $\\Delta p$\": Correct, as per our analysis.\n- \"increasing heat production\": Correct. The energy from increased substrate oxidation ($J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ increases) is diverted from ATP synthesis and dissipated as heat through the leak pathway. This is the primary function of brown adipose tissue.\n- \"reducing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation\": Correct. Efficiency, proportional to $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}/J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$, decreases because the numerator decreases and the denominator increases.\n- \"the rate of ATP synthesis tends to decrease\": Correct. $J_{\\mathrm{ATP}}$ decreases due to the fall in $\\Delta p$.\n- \"unless respiratory capacity is upregulated to offset the leak\": Correct. Upregulating respiratory capacity (e.g., by synthesizing more ETC complexes) would increase the maximal $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$, shifting the $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(\\Delta p)$ curve upwards. This is a known long-term adaptation that can help maintain ATP production in the face of chronic uncoupling.\nThe statement is a comprehensive and accurate description of uncoupling.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Membrane defects that increase nonspecific proton permeability leave $\\Delta p$ unchanged because the phosphate carrier compensates by importing more $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ with $\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$.**\nIncreased nonspecific proton permeability is functionally equivalent to an increase in $g_{\\mathrm{leak}}$. Our analysis has definitively shown that this must lead to a decrease in $\\Delta p$, not leave it unchanged. The phosphate carrier (PIC) is a symporter that uses the proton gradient to import phosphate into the matrix. Its action consumes the PMF, it does not generate or restore it. Forcing more flux through the PIC would further dissipate the PMF, exacerbating the effect of the leak, not compensating for it. The premise that the phosphate carrier could maintain a constant $\\Delta p$ in this scenario is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
