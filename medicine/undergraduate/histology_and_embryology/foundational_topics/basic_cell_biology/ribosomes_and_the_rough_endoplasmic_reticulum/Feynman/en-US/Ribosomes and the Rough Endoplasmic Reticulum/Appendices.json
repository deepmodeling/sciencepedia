This exercise walks you through a quantitative accounting of the high-energy phosphate bonds—in the form of $GTP$ and $ATP$—required to synthesize a polypeptide of a given length. By tallying the costs of initiation, elongation, and termination, you will gain a concrete appreciation for the molecular economy of the cell and the efficiency of the ribosomal machinery .",

            "problem": "A secreted protein is synthesized co-translationally into the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) by ribosomes bound to the RER membrane, after targeting by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP). In eukaryotic translation, the process is classically partitioned into initiation, elongation, and termination, consistent with the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, where polypeptides are built by adding amino acids one at a time to a growing chain. Consider the following well-established event costs during eukaryotic translation at the RER:\n- Initiation requires guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis by eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), counted as $1$ GTP per initiation event.\n- Each elongation cycle that adds one amino acid requires $1$ GTP for delivery of aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleic acid (aminoacyl-tRNA) by eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), and $1$ GTP for ribosomal translocation mediated by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2).\n- Each amino acid added to the polypeptide requires charging of its cognate tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, counted as the equivalent of $2$ ATP molecules per amino acid.\n- Termination requires $1$ GTP for release factor activity.\n\nStarting from these fundamental steps and counts, and using the principle that a polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids undergoes $n-1$ elongation cycles (because the first amino acid is placed during initiation), derive the total GTP and ATP molecules hydrolyzed as functions of $n$, and then evaluate these totals for a secreted protein of length $n = 400$ amino acids synthesized on the RER.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the total number of guanosine triphosphate ($GTP$) and adenosine triphosphate ($ATP$) molecules hydrolyzed during the synthesis of a secreted polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids, and then to evaluate these totals for a protein of length $n=400$.\n\nLet $N_{GTP}(n)$ be the total number of $GTP$ molecules hydrolyzed and $N_{ATP}(n)$ be the total number of $ATP$ molecules hydrolyzed for a polypeptide of length $n$.\n\nFirst, we will derive the function for the total $GTP$ hydrolysis, $N_{GTP}(n)$. The hydrolysis of $GTP$ occurs during three distinct stages of translation: initiation, elongation, and termination. We will sum the costs for each stage.\n\n1.  **Initiation:** The problem states that the initiation of translation for one polypeptide chain requires the hydrolysis of $1$ $GTP$ molecule by eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2).\n    $$GTP_{\\text{initiation}} = 1$$\n\n2.  **Elongation:** The problem specifies that a polypeptide of length $n$ amino acids requires $n-1$ elongation cycles. Each elongation cycle has two steps involving $GTP$ hydrolysis:\n    -   Delivery of an aminoacyl-tRNA by eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), costing $1$ $GTP$.\n    -   Translocation of the ribosome along the messenger RNA, mediated by eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), costing $1$ $GTP$.\n    Therefore, the cost per elongation cycle is $1 + 1 = 2$ $GTP$ molecules. For $n-1$ cycles, the total cost is:\n    $$GTP_{\\text{elongation}} = 2 \\times (n-1) = 2n - 2$$\n\n3.  **Termination:** The release of the completed polypeptide chain requires the hydrolysis of $1$ $GTP$ molecule.\n    $$GTP_{\\text{termination}} = 1$$\n\nThe total number of $GTP$ molecules hydrolyzed, $N_{GTP}(n)$, is the sum of the molecules used in these three stages:\n$$N_{GTP}(n) = GTP_{\\text{initiation}} + GTP_{\\text{elongation}} + GTP_{\\text{termination}}$$\n$$N_{GTP}(n) = 1 + (2n - 2) + 1$$\n$$N_{GTP}(n) = 2n$$\n\nNext, we will derive the function for the total $ATP$ hydrolysis, $N_{ATP}(n)$. According to the problem, $ATP$ is consumed during the charging of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.\n\n1.  **tRNA Charging:** Each amino acid must be \"charged,\" or covalently attached to its cognate tRNA molecule by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, before it can be incorporated into the polypeptide. The problem states this process costs the equivalent of $2$ $ATP$ molecules per amino acid. For a polypeptide of length $n$, there are $n$ amino acids to be incorporated. Thus, $n$ tRNA charging reactions must occur.\n    The total cost for tRNA charging is:\n    $$N_{ATP}(n) = 2 \\times n = 2n$$\n\nWe have now derived the general functions for the total number of hydrolyzed $GTP$ and $ATP$ molecules as functions of polypeptide length $n$:\n$$N_{GTP}(n) = 2n$$\n$$N_{ATP}(n) = 2n$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate these functions for a secreted protein of length $n = 400$ amino acids.\n\nFor $GTP$:\n$$N_{GTP}(400) = 2 \\times 400 = 800$$\n\nFor $ATP$:\n$$N_{ATP}(400) = 2 \\times 400 = 800$$\n\nThe total hydrolyzed molecules are $800$ $GTP$ and $800$ $ATP$.

            "introduction": "Many proteins synthesized on the rough ER are not secreted but are instead embedded within the membrane, where their specific orientation, or topology, is critical for function. This practice challenges you to act like a molecular cell biologist, using a set of rules—including the \"positive-inside\" rule and the functions of different signal sequences—to predict the final structure of single-pass membrane proteins. Mastering these principles is key to understanding how a cell builds its complex and functional membrane systems .",

            "problem": "A nascent polypeptide synthesized on cytosolic ribosomes can be targeted co-translationally to the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) by the Signal Recognition Particle (SRP), which recognizes hydrophobic signal sequences and delivers the ribosome–nascent chain complex to the Sec61 translocon. In the ER, insertion orientation for single-pass integral membrane proteins is established at the time of translocation by the interplay of (i) the presence or absence of a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide, (ii) an internal signal-anchor or stop-transfer segment, and (iii) charge distribution flanking the transmembrane helix, following the “positive-inside” rule (enrichment of lysine and arginine residues on the cytosolic side). In addition, N-linked glycosylation of the $Asn-X-Ser/Thr$ motif occurs only on segments that reside in the ER lumen.\n\nConsider the following three engineered single-pass polypeptides translated in vitro in the presence of rough microsomes:\n\n- Construct $\\alpha$: The N-terminus begins with a hydrophobic signal sequence that contains a canonical signal peptidase $-3$, $-1$ rule motif (small residues at positions $-3$ and $-1$ relative to the scissile bond). Downstream, there is one hydrophobic segment predicted to function as a stop-transfer. An N-linked glycosylation sequon placed near the extreme N-terminus becomes glycosylated.\n- Construct $\\beta$: There is no N-terminal cleavable signal peptide. A single internal hydrophobic segment serves as a signal-anchor. A cluster of lysine/arginine residues lies N-terminal to this hydrophobic segment. An N-linked glycosylation sequon introduced near the C-terminus becomes glycosylated.\n- Construct $\\gamma$: There is no N-terminal cleavable signal peptide. A single internal hydrophobic segment serves as a signal-anchor. A cluster of lysine/arginine residues lies C-terminal to this hydrophobic segment. An N-linked glycosylation sequon introduced near the N-terminus becomes glycosylated.\n\nWhich option most precisely defines type I, type II, and type III membrane protein topologies in the context of ER insertion, correctly explains the sequence determinants that dictate lumenal versus cytosolic N-termini, and consistently maps constructs $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$ to their respective types?\n\nA. Type I proteins have cytosolic N-termini and insert via internal signal-anchors; type II proteins have lumenal N-termini produced by a cleavable signal peptide; type III proteins are multi-pass with two anchors. Orientation is set solely by hydrophobicity. Construct mapping: $\\alpha$ is type II, $\\beta$ is type III, $\\gamma$ is type I.\n\nB. Type I proteins have lumenal N-termini created by an N-terminal cleavable signal peptide followed by a stop-transfer transmembrane segment; type II proteins are single-pass with an internal signal-anchor that yields a cytosolic N-terminus and lumenal C-terminus; type III proteins are single-pass with an internal signal-anchor that yields a lumenal N-terminus and cytosolic C-terminus. Orientation is determined primarily by the positive-inside rule (lysine/arginine enrichment on the cytosolic side) and by whether a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide is present; signal peptidase cleaves only N-terminal signal peptides, not internal anchors; SRP can engage either N-terminal signal peptides or internal signal-anchors. Construct mapping: $\\alpha$ is type I, $\\beta$ is type II, $\\gamma$ is type III.\n\nC. Type I and type III proteins are topologically identical except for the positions of glycosylation sequons; SRP does not bind internal hydrophobic segments. Orientation is determined solely by the presence of Asn-$X$-Ser/Thr motifs. Construct mapping: $\\alpha$ is type I, $\\beta$ is type I, $\\gamma$ is type III.\n\nD. Type II proteins carry a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide and therefore have lumenal N-termini; type I proteins lack signal peptides; type III proteins insert only after translation is complete. Orientation is dictated by net hydrophobicity and the number of transmembrane segments, not by flanking charges. Construct mapping: $\\alpha$ is type II, $\\beta$ is type I, $\\gamma$ is type III.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to determine the topology of three protein constructs ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$) and to identify the option that correctly defines the protein types and maps the constructs accordingly.\n\n**1. Analysis of Protein Topology Rules and Definitions**\n\nFirst, let's establish the canonical definitions of single-pass membrane protein types based on the principles given in the problem:\n-   **Type I:** These proteins are synthesized with a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide that targets the nascent chain to the ER. This signal sequence threads the N-terminus into the lumen. A subsequent hydrophobic stop-transfer anchor sequence spans the membrane, halting translocation. This leaves the N-terminus in the ER lumen (after cleavage of the signal peptide) and the C-terminus in the cytosol.\n-   **Type II:** These proteins lack a cleavable signal peptide. Instead, a single internal hydrophobic sequence serves as both a signal for ER targeting and a membrane anchor (a signal-anchor). For Type II proteins, the \"positive-inside rule\" dictates that a cluster of positively charged amino acids (Lys, Arg) located on the N-terminal side of the signal-anchor keeps the N-terminus in the cytosol. The C-terminus is consequently translocated into the ER lumen. The final topology is N-terminus in cytosol, C-terminus in lumen.\n-   **Type III:** These proteins also use an internal signal-anchor. However, the positive charges are located on the C-terminal side of the anchor. The positive-inside rule thus keeps the C-terminus in the cytosol, while the N-terminus is threaded into the ER lumen. The final topology is N-terminus in lumen, C-terminus in cytosol.\n-   **N-linked Glycosylation:** This modification occurs on specific sequons only on protein domains exposed to the ER lumen, serving as a reliable marker for lumenal localization.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Constructs**\n\n-   **Construct $\\alpha$:** It possesses a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide followed by a stop-transfer sequence. This is the defining characteristic of a **Type I** membrane protein. The fact that an N-terminal sequon is glycosylated confirms that the N-terminus was successfully translocated into the lumen before cleavage.\n-   **Construct $\\beta$:** It uses an internal signal-anchor. The key information is the cluster of positive charges N-terminal to this anchor. By the positive-inside rule, this N-terminal region is retained in the cytosol. The C-terminal region is translocated into the lumen. This is the definition of a **Type II** protein. The glycosylation of a C-terminal sequon confirms the lumenal location of the C-terminus.\n-   **Construct $\\gamma$:** It also uses an internal signal-anchor, but the positive charges are C-terminal to it. By the positive-inside rule, the C-terminal region is retained in the cytosol, forcing the N-terminal region to be translocated into the lumen. This is the definition of a **Type III** protein. The glycosylation of an N-terminal sequon confirms the lumenal location of the N-terminus.\n\n**3. Evaluation of the Options**\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct mapping is: $\\alpha \\rightarrow$ Type I, $\\beta \\rightarrow$ Type II, $\\gamma \\rightarrow$ Type III.\n\n-   **Option A:** Contains incorrect definitions (e.g., Type I has cytosolic N-termini) and an incorrect mapping.\n-   **Option B:** Provides correct definitions for all three types. It correctly states the mechanisms, including the role of the cleavable signal peptide, the internal signal-anchor, and the positive-inside rule. Its mapping, \"$\\alpha$ is type I, $\\beta$ is type II, $\\gamma$ is type III,\" perfectly matches our derived mapping.\n-   **Option C:** Contains several incorrect statements (e.g., SRP does not bind internal hydrophobic segments) and an incorrect mapping.\n-   **Option D:** Contains incorrect definitions (e.g., Type II has a cleavable signal peptide) and an incorrect mapping.\n\nThus, Option B is the only choice that is entirely correct in its definitions, mechanistic explanations, and mapping of the constructs.",

            "problem": "A mammalian secretory cell type with abundant Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) is used to study how ribosome behavior on RER-bound messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) shapes sucrose gradient polysome profiles. The fundamental base is as follows: according to the Central Dogma and canonical eukaryotic translation, repeated translation initiation loads ribosomes onto an mRNA while elongation advances at a finite speed. At steady state, the average number of ribosomes per mRNA depends on the initiation rate and the time required to traverse the coding sequence. In sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation, larger complexes (e.g., polysomes with more ribosomes) sediment further into the gradient than smaller complexes; prior calibration with known standards under the same rotor speed and gradient conditions showed that the index of the main absorbance peak fraction increases approximately linearly with the number of ribosomes $n$ bound per mRNA, following $f(n) = 4.5 + 0.3 n$ for $1 \\le n \\le 30$, with an accuracy of $\\pm 0.2$ fraction.\n\nYou isolate the microsomal fraction (membrane-bound ribosomes on RER) from cells expressing a single dominant secretory mRNA of coding length $L = 600 \\text{ codons}$. The measured steady-state initiation rate is $k_i = 0.10 \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the measured average elongation speed is $v_e = 5 \\text{ codons/s}$. Ribosomes are sterically excluded from overlapping; the minimal center-to-center spacing is $\\delta = 10 \\text{ codons}$, so the physical maximum occupancy is $N_{\\max} = L / \\delta$. Assume the following idealizations hold: (i) in steady state, the average ribosome occupancy per mRNA is $N \\approx k_i \\times T$, where $T$ is the average transit time $T = L / v_e$, provided $N \\le N_{\\max}$; (ii) immediately after an initiation inhibitor is added at time $t = 0$, initiation ceases ($k_i \\to 0$), but elongation continues at the same $v_e$, and ribosomes initially on the mRNA are approximately uniformly distributed along the coding sequence; (iii) an elongation inhibitor reduces the elongation speed to $v_e' = \\alpha v_e$ with $\\alpha = 0.5$ while leaving initiation otherwise permitted, so a new steady-state occupancy forms with the same idealization $N' \\approx k_i \\times (L / v_e')$ provided $N' \\le N_{\\max}$.\n\nUsing only these foundations, derive the expected direction and magnitude of shifts in the main sucrose gradient peak for the RER polysome profile in two perturbations:\n\n1.

The provided parameters are biologically plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and explicit models to calculate the required quantities. The language is objective and unambiguous.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by calculating the ribosome occupancy and corresponding peak fraction for the three specified conditions.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe solution requires three sequential calculations: the initial steady state, the state after initiation inhibition, and the new steady state under elongation inhibition.\n\n**1. Initial Steady-State Condition**\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial average number of ribosomes per mRNA, denoted as $N$. The average transit time $T$ for a ribosome to traverse the entire coding sequence is:\n$$T = \\frac{L}{v_e} = \\frac{600 \\text{ codons}}{5 \\text{ codons/s}} = 120 \\mathrm{s}$$\nAccording to the provided model (i), the average steady-state occupancy $N$ is:\n$$N \\approx k_i \\times T = 0.10 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 120 \\mathrm{s} = 12$$\nWe must verify this is below the maximum physical occupancy, $N_{\\max}$:\n$$N_{\\max} = \\frac{L}{\\delta} = \\frac{600 \\text{ codons}}{10 \\text{ codons}} = 60$$\nSince $N = 12  N_{\\max} = 60$, the initiation-limited model is applicable.\nNow, we use the calibration function $f(n) = 4.5 + 0.3 n$ to find the initial peak fraction, $f_0$. The occupancy $N = 12$ falls within the valid range of the function ($1 \\le 12 \\le 30$).\n$$f_0 = f(N) = 4.5 + 0.3 \\times 12 = 4.5 + 3.6 = 8.1$$\n\n**2. Perturbation 1: Initiation Inhibition**\n\nAt time $t=0$, initiation ceases ($k_i \\to 0$). Ribosomes already on the mRNA continue to elongate at $v_e = 5 \\text{ codons/s}$. After a time $t = 60 \\mathrm{s}$, all ribosomes that were initially within the last $v_e \\times t$ codons of the mRNA will have completed translation and dissociated. The length of this \"run-off\" region is:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{runoff}} = v_e \\times t = 5 \\text{ codons/s} \\times 60 \\mathrm{s} = 300 \\text{ codons}$$\nThe problem states to assume the initial $N=12$ ribosomes are uniformly distributed along the length $L = 600 \\text{ codons}$. Therefore, the number of ribosomes that have run off is proportional to the fraction of the mRNA length they occupied. The number of ribosomes remaining, $N_I$, will be the number that initially occupied the first $L - d_{\\mathrm{runoff}}$ codons.\n$$N_I \\approx N \\times \\left( \\frac{L - d_{\\mathrm{runoff}}}{L} \\right) = 12 \\times \\left( \\frac{600 - 300}{600} \\right) = 12 \\times \\frac{300}{600} = 12 \\times 0.5 = 6$$\nThe new average occupancy is $N_I = 6$. This is within the valid range of the calibration function ($1 \\le 6 \\le 30$). The corresponding peak fraction, $f_I$, is:\n$$f_I = f(N_I) = 4.5 + 0.3 \\times 6 = 4.5 + 1.8 = 6.3$$\nThis represents a shift to a smaller fraction index, indicating smaller polysomes, which is consistent with initiation inhibition.\n\n**3. Perturbation 2: Elongation Inhibition**\n\nIn this scenario, the elongation speed is reduced to $v_e' = \\alpha v_e$ while the initiation rate $k_i$ remains at its original value. The system reaches a new steady state.\nThe new elongation speed is:\n$$v_e' = \\alpha \\times v_e = 0.5 \\times 5 \\text{ codons/s} = 2.5 \\text{ codons/s}$$\nThe new average transit time, $T'$, is:\n$$T' = \\frac{L}{v_e'} = \\frac{600 \\text{ codons}}{2.5 \\text{ codons/s}} = 240 \\mathrm{s}$$\nUsing the steady-state model (iii), the new average occupancy, $N'$, is:\n$$N' \\approx k_i \\times T' = 0.10 \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\times 240 \\mathrm{s} = 24$$\nWe check this against the maximum occupancy: $N' = 24  N_{\\max} = 60$. The model is applicable.\nThe occupancy $N' = 24$ is also within the valid range of the calibration function ($1 \\le 24 \\le 30$). The new steady-state peak fraction, $f_E$, is:\n$$f_E = f(N') = 4.5 + 0.3 \\times 24 = 4.5 + 7.2 = 11.7$$\nThis represents a shift to a larger fraction index, indicating larger, more densely packed polysomes, which is consistent with elongation inhibition.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. Initiation inhibition ($t = 60 \\mathrm{s}$): peak shifts from $f_0$ to $f_I = 6.3$; elongation inhibition ($\\alpha = 0.5$): peak shifts to $f_E = 11.7$.**\nOur calculation for the initiation inhibition scenario yielded a new peak at $f_I = 6.3$. This matches the value provided. Our calculation for the elongation inhibition scenario yielded a new peak at $f_E = 11.7$. This also matches the value provided.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Initiation inhibition ($t = 60 \\mathrm{s}$): peak shifts to $f_I = 9.0$; elongation inhibition ($\\alpha = 0.5$): peak shifts to $f_E = 6.0$.**\nThe value for $f_I$ is stated as $9.0$, which contradicts our calculated value of $6.3$. The value for $f_E$ is stated as $6.0$, which contradicts our calculated value of $11.7$. This option reverses the direction of the expected shifts.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Initiation inhibition ($t = 60 \\mathrm{s}$): peak shifts to $f_I = 5.7$; elongation inhibition ($\\alpha = 0.5$): peak shifts to $f_E = 10.5$.**\nThe value for $f_I$ is stated as $5.7$, which contradicts our calculated value of $6.3$. The difference ($0.6$) is greater than the stated accuracy of the measurement ($\\pm 0.2$). The value for $f_E$ is stated as $10.5$, which contradicts our calculated value of $11.7$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Initiation inhibition ($t = 60 \\mathrm{s}$): no peak shift ($f_I = f_0$); elongation inhibition ($\\alpha = 0.5$): peak shifts to $f_E = 9.6$.**\nThis option claims no peak shift for initiation inhibition, which contradicts our calculation showing a shift from $f_0=8.1$ to $f_I=6.3$. The value for $f_E$ is stated as $9.6$, which contradicts our calculated value of $11.7$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
