            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium ions ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$) and its numerical calculation under specified conditions. The derivation begins with the definition of the electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$, for an ionic species.\n\nThe electrochemical potential of an ion is the sum of its chemical potential and the electrical potential energy per mole. For an ion $i$, it is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_i = \\mu_i^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(a_i) + z_i F V\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_i^{\\circ}$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $a_i$ is the activity of the ion, $z_i$ is its valence (charge number), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential of the solution.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane. This condition implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is the same on both sides of the membrane. Let the cytosolic side be denoted by 'in' and the extracellular side by 'out'. For potassium ions ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$), the equilibrium condition is:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{K, in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{K, out}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential for $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ on both sides, we get:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, in}}) + z_{\\mathrm{K}} F V_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, out}}) + z_{\\mathrm{K}} F V_{\\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}}^{\\circ}$, depends on the nature of the ion and the solvent, which are the same on both sides of the membrane. Therefore, it cancels out from the equation:\n$$\nRT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, in}}) + z_{\\mathrm{K}} F V_{\\mathrm{in}} = RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, out}}) + z_{\\mathrm{K}} F V_{\\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nWe are asked to solve for the equilibrium potential difference, defined as $E_{\\mathrm{K}} \\equiv V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}$. Rearranging the equation to group the potential terms on one side and the activity terms on the other:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{K}} F (V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_{\\mathrm{out}}) = RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, out}}) - RT \\ln(a_{\\mathrm{K, in}})\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$, we simplify the right-hand side:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{K}} F E_{\\mathrm{K}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{K, out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{K, in}}}\\right)\n$$\nIsolating the equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{K}}$ gives:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{K}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{K, out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{K, in}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states to use the ideal-solution approximation, where the activity $a_i$ of a species is approximated by its molar concentration, $[i]$. Thus, $a_{\\mathrm{K, out}} \\approx [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{K, in}} \\approx [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}$.

            "solution": "The user wants me to act as an exacting STEM professor. I will first validate the problem statement and then provide a detailed solution.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   Protein length: $120$ amino acids.\n-   Plasma membrane hydrophobic core thickness: approximately $3$ nanometers (nm).\n-   $\\alpha$-helix advance per residue: approximately $0.15$ nm per residue along its axis.\n-   Kyte–Doolittle (KD) hydropathy method: computes an averaged hydropathy score using a sliding window of $w$ residues.\n-   Rule for window size $w$: larger $w$ emphasizes contiguous stretches long enough to plausibly span the membrane.\n-   KD scale interpretation: higher positive values indicate greater hydrophobicity.\n-   Factual assumptions:\n    1.

Inclusion of multiple glycines (Gly) or prolines (Pro) often destabilizes an $\\alpha$-helix.\n    3.  Charged residues are energetically unfavorable in the hydrophobic core.\n-   KD analysis results (using window size $w = 21$ residues):\n    -   Segment $S1$: positions $12$ to $32$, average KD hydropathy $H = 1.9$; composition includes $2$ serines and a lysine at position $32$.\n    -   Segment $S2$: positions $48$ to $68$, average KD hydropathy $H = 1.4$; composition includes $5$ glycines, $2$ prolines, and $2$ aspartates within the window.\n    -   Segment $S3$: positions $85$ to $105$, average KD hydropathy $H = 2.1$; composition is rich in leucine, isoleucine, and valine, with no charged residues in the window.\n-   Question: Choose the most appropriate combination of sliding window size and hydropathy threshold, and indicate which segments are predicted to be true transmembrane helices.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of protein biophysics and bioinformatics. The dimensions of a cell membrane, the structure of an $\\alpha$-helix, the Kyte-Doolittle hydropathy scale, and the energetic considerations for amino acids in a lipid environment are all standard and factual concepts in biochemistry and molecular biology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to evaluate the candidate segments and the proposed methodologies in the options. A single best answer can be reasoned from the provided data and principles.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language. The data are quantitative ($H$ scores, positions) or based on well-accepted qualitative rules (e.g., properties of Gly, Pro, and charged residues).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify the most plausible transmembrane (TM) helices among the three candidate segments ($S1$, $S2$, $S3$) by applying fundamental biophysical principles and evaluating the proposed parameter sets.\n\n**1. Required Length of a Transmembrane Helix**\n\nFirst, we determine the number of amino acid residues required to form an $\\alpha$-helix that spans the hydrophobic core of the plasma membrane.\n-   Thickness of the hydrophobic core, $T \\approx 3$ nm.\n-   Axial advance per residue in an $\\alpha$-helix, $d \\approx 0.15$ nm/residue.\n\nThe number of residues, $N_{\\text{res}}$, required to span this thickness is:\n$$N_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{T}{d} = \\frac{3 \\text{ nm}}{0.15 \\text{ nm/residue}} = 20 \\text{ residues}$$\nTherefore, a plausible TM helix must be a continuous segment of approximately $20$ residues. All three candidate segments, $S1$, $S2$, and $S3$, are defined over a window of $21$ residues ($32-12+1=21$, $68-48+1=21$, $105-85+1=21$), which perfectly matches this physical requirement.\n\n**2. Appropriate Parameters for KD Analysis**\n\n-   **Window Size ($w$)**: The problem states that \"larger $w$ emphasizes contiguous stretches long enough to plausibly span the membrane.\" Since a TM helix is about $20$ residues long, a window size $w$ in the range of $19$ to $21$ is standard and appropriate. A window size of $w=21$ was used to generate the data and is an excellent choice. A smaller window like $w=7$ would be too sensitive to short hydrophobic patches and is not suitable for identifying TM helices. A larger window like $w=30$ might over-smooth the data, potentially causing the average hydropathy of a true $20$-residue TM helix to be diluted by adjacent non-hydrophobic flanking regions.\n-   **Hydropathy Threshold ($H$)**: This is an empirical cutoff. For the KD scale with a window of $w \\approx 20$, a commonly accepted threshold for a segment to be considered a strong TM candidate is $H \\ge 1.6$. A threshold that is too low (e.g., $H \\ge 1.0$ or $H \\ge 1.2$) will lead to many false positives, while a threshold that is too high (e.g., $H \\ge 2.3$) may lead to false negatives.\n\n**3. Analysis of Candidate Segments**\n\nWe must evaluate each segment based on its length (which we've established is appropriate for all three), its average hydropathy score, and its amino acid composition.\n\n-   **Segment $S1$ (positions $12-32$)**:\n    -   Hydropathy: $H = 1.9$. This is above the standard threshold of $H \\ge 1.6$, indicating a significantly hydrophobic character.\n    -   Composition: It contains $2$ serines and a lysine at position $32$. Serine is polar but can be accommodated within a TM helix. The lysine, a positively charged residue, is located at position $32$, which is the very end of the segment. Charged residues are frequently found at the interface between the hydrophobic core and the polar headgroups of the lipids, where they can interact with the aqueous environment or the headgroups. This positioning is not only permissible but is a common feature that helps anchor the helix.\n    -   Conclusion: $S1$ is a very strong candidate for a true TM helix.\n\n-   **Segment $S2$ (positions $48-68$)**:\n    -   Hydropathy: $H = 1.4$. This score is below the standard threshold of $H \\ge 1.6$. While hydrophobic, it is not strongly so.\n    -   Composition: It contains $5$ glycines and $2$ prolines. Glycine's conformational flexibility and proline's rigid kink-inducing structure are both known to be highly disruptive to the regular geometry of an $\\alpha$-helix. A total of $7$ such residues out of $21$ makes the formation of a stable, regular $\\alpha$-helix highly improbable. Furthermore, it contains $2$ aspartates, which are negatively charged. The presence of charged residues within the hydrophobic core is energetically very costly. Unlike the lysine at the boundary of $S1$, the positions of these aspartates are not specified as being at the ends. Their presence within the core-spanning region would be a major destabilizing factor.\n    -   Conclusion: $S2$ is a very poor candidate. It fails on both hydropathy score and, more decisively, on composition. It is highly unlikely to be a true TM helix.\n\n-   **Segment $S3$ (positions $85-105$)**:\n    -   Hydropathy: $H = 2.1$. This is a very high score, indicating strong hydrophobicity.\n    -   Composition: The segment is rich in leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which are all strongly hydrophobic and potent $\\alpha$-helix formers. Crucially, it contains no charged residues within the window.\n    -   Conclusion: $S3$ is an ideal candidate for a true TM helix. It meets all criteria perfectly.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:** Based on a rigorous application of biophysical principles, segments $S1$ and $S3$ are predicted to be true transmembrane helices, while segment $S2$ is not.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on our derived conclusions.\n\n**A. Use window $w = 7$ and threshold $H \\ge 1.2$; predict $S1$, $S2$, and $S3$ as transmembrane helices.**\n-   Parameters: The window size $w=7$ is too small for identifying membrane-spanning segments, as it would flag any short hydrophobic sequence. The threshold $H \\ge 1.2$ is too low and prone to false positives.\n-   Prediction: This option correctly identifies $S1$ and $S3$ but incorrectly includes $S2$, which our analysis showed is not a viable TM helix due to its composition.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The parameters are inappropriate, and the prediction is flawed.\n\n**B. Use window $w = 21$ and threshold $H \\ge 1.6$; predict $S1$ and $S3$ as transmembrane helices, exclude $S2$.**\n-   Parameters: The window size $w=21$ is ideal, matching the calculated length of a TM helix. The threshold $H \\ge 1.6$ is a standard, reasonable value. Using this threshold, $S1$ ($H=1.9$) and $S3$ ($H=2.1$) pass, while $S2$ ($H=1.4$) fails.\n-   Prediction: The prediction—that $S1$ and $S3$ are TM helices and $S2$ is not—perfectly aligns with our detailed analysis of all available information, including hydropathy scores and crucial compositional details.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**. Both the proposed methodology and the resulting prediction are sound.\n\n**C. Use window $w = 21$ and threshold $H \\ge 2.3$; predict only $S3$ as a transmembrane helix.**\n-   Parameters: The window size $w=21$ is appropriate. However, the threshold $H \\ge 2.3$ is excessively stringent. With this threshold, *all three* segments would be rejected, since $H_{S1}=1.9$, $H_{S2}=1.4$, and $H_{S3}=2.1$ are all less than $2.3$.\n-   Prediction: The prediction (\"predict only $S3$\") is inconsistent with the proposed threshold (which would predict zero helices). Furthermore, even if the threshold were slightly lower (e.g., $H \\ge 2.0$) to include $S3$, the exclusion of $S1$ is not justified. $S1$ is a strong candidate.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. The option is internally inconsistent and its prediction is biophysically unjustified.\n\n**D. Use window $w = 30$ and threshold $H \\ge 1.0$; predict $S2$ and $S3$ as transmembrane helices, exclude $S1$.**\n-   Parameters: The window size $w=30$ is larger than optimal and could lead to inaccuracies. The threshold $H \\ge 1.0$ is far too lenient, risking the inclusion of many false positives.\n-   Prediction: This prediction is deeply flawed. It incorrectly includes the non-viable $S2$ and incorrectly excludes the strong candidate $S1$.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**. Both the parameters and the prediction are poor choices.",

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the single-channel conductance, $g$, of a potassium-selective channel, modeled as an ideal ohmic pore. This requires determining the slope of the current-voltage ($I$-$V$) relationship from a given set of experimental data. The solution proceeds in three steps: first, calculating the theoretical reversal potential as a conceptual foundation; second, setting up the linear model for an ohmic pore; and third, performing a linear least-squares regression on the data to find the best-fit slope, which represents the conductance.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for electrochemical equilibrium. The reversal potential, or Nernst potential, $E_K$, for potassium ($K^{+}$) is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of $K^{+}$ ions across the membrane. It is given by the Nernst equation:\n$$E_K = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}}}{[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}}}\\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the Gas Constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday Constant, and $[K^{+}]_{\\text{out}}$ and $[K^{+}]_{\\text{in}}$ are the potassium concentrations on the extracellular and cytosolic sides, respectively.

The problem states the channel is an \"ideal ohmic pore\". For such a channel, the steady-state current, $I$, is directly proportional to the electrochemical driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the ion's reversal potential, $E_K$. This relationship is a form of Ohm's Law:\n$$I = g(V_m - E_K)$$\nwhere $g$ is the single-channel conductance. This equation can be rewritten in the form of a linear equation, $y = mx + c$:\n$$I = gV_m - gE_K$$\nHere, $I$ is the dependent variable ($y$), $V_m$ is the independent variable ($x$), the slope $m$ is the conductance $g$, and the y-intercept $c$ is $-gE_K$. The problem instructs us to find $g$ as the best-fit slope of the current as a function of membrane potential, using all data points. This is accomplished via a linear least-squares regression.\n\nThe $n=5$ data points $(V_m, I)$ are provided in units of $(\\text{mV}, \\text{pA})$. Let $x_i = V_m$ and $y_i = I$:\n- $(x_1, y_1) = (-120, -3.46)$\n- $(x_2, y_2) = (-80, -1.52)$\n- $(x_3, y_3) = (-40, 0.48)$\n- $(x_4, y_4) = (0, 2.56)$\n- $(x_5, y_5) = (40, 4.51)$\n\nThe formula for the slope, $g$, of the best-fit line is:\n$$g = \\frac{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i)}{n \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 - (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i)^2}$$\n\nWe compute the required sums:\n- $n = 5$\n- $\\sum x_i = -120 - 80 - 40 + 0 + 40 = -200$\n- $\\sum y_i = -3.46 - 1.52 + 0.48 + 2.56 + 4.51 = 2.57$\n- $\\sum x_i^2 = (-120)^2 + (-80)^2 + (-40)^2 + 0^2 + 40^2 = 14400 + 6400 + 1600 + 0 + 1600 = 24000$\n- $\\sum x_i y_i = (-120)(-3.46) + (-80)(-1.52) + (-40)(0.48) + (0)(2.56) + (40)(4.51)$\n- $\\sum x_i y_i = 415.2 + 121.6 - 19.2 + 0 + 180.4 = 698.0$\n\nSubstituting these sums into the slope formula:\n$$g = \\frac{5(698.0) - (-200)(2.57)}{5(24000) - (-200)^2} = \\frac{3490 + 514}{120000 - 40000} = \\frac{4004}{80000} = 0.05005$$\n\nThe units of this slope are the units of $y$ divided by the units of $x$, which is $\\text{pA}/\\text{mV}$. The problem requires the answer in picoSiemens ($\\text{pS}$). We perform a unit conversion:\n$$g = 0.05005\\,\\frac{\\text{pA}}{\\text{mV}} = 0.05005\\,\\frac{10^{-12}\\,\\text{A}}{10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}} = 0.05005 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\frac{\\text{A}}{\\text{V}}$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{Siemen} \\,(\\text{S}) = 1\\,\\text{A}/\\text{V}$, we have $g = 0.05005 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}$.\nTo convert to picoSiemens ($1\\,\\text{pS} = 10^{-12}\\,\\text{S}$):\n$$g = \\frac{0.05005 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}}{10^{-12}\\,\\text{S}/\\text{pS}} = 0.05005 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{pS} = 50.05\\,\\text{pS}$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to three significant figures as requested.\n$$g \\approx 50.1\\,\\text{pS}$$\nThe reversal potential implied by the fit is $E_{rev} = -c/g = -(\\bar{y} - g\\bar{x})/g$. With $\\bar{x} = -40\\,\\text{mV}$ and $\\bar{y} = 0.514\\,\\text{pA}$, the intercept is $c = 0.514 - (0.05005)(-40) = 2.516\\,\\text{pA}$. The reversal potential is $E_{rev} = -2.516/0.05005 \\approx -50.27\\,\\text{mV}$, which is in excellent agreement with the theoretical Nernst potential of $-49.97\\,\\text{mV}$, confirming the consistency of the data with the model.",
