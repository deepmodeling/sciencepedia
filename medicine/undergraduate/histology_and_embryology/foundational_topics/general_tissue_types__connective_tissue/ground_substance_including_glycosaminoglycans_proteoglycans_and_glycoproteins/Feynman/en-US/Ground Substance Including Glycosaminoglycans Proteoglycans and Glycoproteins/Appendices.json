            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biochemistry and physical chemistry, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated in objective, formal language. It is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nThe solution will be developed from first principles as requested. We are tasked with deriving a general expression for the fixed charge density, $c_f$, and then applying it to a specific case.\n\nThe fixed charge density, $c_f$, is defined as the total molar concentration of negative charges per liter of water.\n$$c_f = \\frac{\\text{total moles of negative charge}}{\\text{volume of water in liters}}$$\n\nLet us consider a reference volume of tissue, $V_{\\text{tissue}} = 1\\,\\text{L}$. The mass of each glycosaminoglycan (GAG) species $i$ within this volume is given by its mass concentration, $c_{m,i}$.\n$$m_i = c_{m,i} \\times V_{\\text{tissue}} = c_{m,i} \\quad (\\text{in units of g})$$\n\nEach GAG polymer of species $i$ is composed of repeating disaccharide units. The total number of moles of these disaccharide units for species $i$ can be found by dividing the total mass of the species, $m_i$, by the average molecular weight of a single disaccharide unit, $M_{\\text{dis},i}$.\nThe total number of moles of disaccharide units of species $i$ in $1\\,\\text{L}$ of tissue is:\n$$n_{\\text{dis},i} = \\frac{m_i}{M_{\\text{dis},i}} = \\frac{c_{m,i}}{M_{\\text{dis},i}} \\quad (\\text{in units of mol per L of tissue})$$\nThis value represents the molar concentration of disaccharide repeating units of species $i$ with respect to the total tissue volume. Note that the degree of polymerization, $\\text{DP}_i$, which is the number of disaccharide units per polymer chain, is not needed to calculate the total number of disaccharide units from the total mass concentration. The total number of repeating units is determined by the total mass and the mass of one unit, irrespective of how many units are linked together in a single chain.\n\nNext, we determine the number of negative charges per disaccharide unit for each species $i$. At physiological pH, sulfates ($-SO_3^−$) and carboxylates ($-COO^−$) are fully ionized and each contributes one negative charge.\nFor species $i$, the average number of sulfates per disaccharide is $s_i$.\nThe average fraction of disaccharides containing a carboxylate is $f_i$.\nTherefore, the total average number of negative charges per disaccharide unit for species $i$, denoted by $z_i$, is the sum of contributions from sulfates and carboxylates:\n$$z_i = s_i + f_i \\quad (\\text{in units of moles of charge per mole of disaccharides})$$\n\nThe molar concentration of negative charges contributed by species $i$, per liter of tissue, is the product of the molar concentration of its disaccharide units and the average charge per unit:\n$$c_{\\text{charge},i}^{\\text{tissue}} = n_{\\text{dis},i} \\times z_i = \\frac{c_{m,i}}{M_{\\text{dis},i}} (s_i + f_i)$$\n\nThe total molar concentration of negative charges from all GAG species in the mixture, per liter of tissue, is the sum of the contributions from each species:\n$$c_{\\text{charge, total}}^{\\text{tissue}} = \\sum_i c_{\\text{charge},i}^{\\text{tissue}} = \\sum_i \\frac{c_{m,i}}{M_{\\text{dis},i}} (s_i + f_i)$$\nThe units for this quantity are moles of charge per liter of tissue.\n\nThe problem requires the fixed charge density, $c_f$, in moles of charge per liter of *water*. The tissue water volume fraction, $\\phi_w$, provides the conversion factor. For our reference volume of $V_{\\text{tissue}} = 1\\,\\text{L}$, the volume of water is:\n$$V_{\\text{water}} = \\phi_w \\times V_{\\text{tissue}} = \\phi_w \\times 1\\,\\text{L} = \\phi_w \\quad (\\text{in units of L})$$\n\nThe fixed charge density $c_f$ is the total moles of charge (calculated for $1\\,\\text{L}$ of tissue) divided by the volume of water within that liter of tissue:\n$$c_f = \\frac{c_{\\text{charge, total}}^{\\text{tissue}}}{V_{\\text{water}}} = \\frac{1}{\\phi_w} \\sum_i \\frac{c_{m,i}}{M_{\\text{dis},i}} (s_i + f_i)$$\nThis is the required general expression for the fixed charge density $c_f$.\n\nRegarding the scaling of $c_f$ with the average degree of polymerization $\\text{DP}_i$: as demonstrated in the derivation, the parameter $\\text{DP}_i$ does not appear in the final expression for $c_f$. The fixed charge density depends on the total mass of the GAGs (via $c_{m,i}$) and the properties of their repeating units ($M_{\\text{dis},i}$, $s_i$, $f_i$), but not on the length of the polymer chains. Therefore, assuming all other parameters are held constant, $c_f$ is independent of $\\text{DP}_i$. Mathematically, $c_f$ scales with $(\\text{DP}_i)^0$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $c_f$ using the provided data. The mixture consists of three species: chondroitin sulfate (CS), keratan sulfate (KS), and heparan sulfate (HS).\nThe expression for $c_f$ is:\n$$c_f = \\frac{1}{\\phi_w} \\left[ \\frac{c_{m,\\text{CS}}}{M_{\\text{dis},\\text{CS}}} (s_{\\text{CS}} + f_{\\text{CS}}) + \\frac{c_{m,\\text{KS}}}{M_{\\text{dis},\\text{KS}}} (s_{\\text{KS}} + f_{\\text{KS}}) + \\frac{c_{m,\\text{HS}}}{M_{\\text{dis},\\text{HS}}} (s_{\\text{HS}} + f_{\\text{HS}}) \\right]$$\n\nWe substitute the given values:\n- $\\phi_w = 0.75$\n- For CS: $c_{m,\\text{CS}} = 3.0\\,\\text{g L}^{-1}$, $M_{\\text{dis},\\text{CS}} = 495\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$, $s_{\\text{CS}} = 1.0$, $f_{\\text{CS}} = 1.0$.\n- For KS: $c_{m,\\text{KS}} = 1.5\\,\\text{g L}^{-1}$, $M_{\\text{dis},\\text{KS}} = 400\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$, $s_{\\text{KS}} = 0.9$, $f_{\\text{KS}} = 0.0$.\n- For HS: $c_{m,\\text{HS}} = 0.5\\,\\text{g L}^{-1}$, $M_{\\text{dis},\\text{HS}} = 500\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$, $s_{\\text{HS}} = 0.8$, $f_{\\text{HS}} = 0.5$.\n\n$$c_f = \\frac{1}{0.75} \\left[ \\frac{3.0}{495} (1.0 + 1.0) + \\frac{1.5}{400} (0.9 + 0.0) + \\frac{0.5}{500} (0.8 + 0.5) \\right]$$\n$$c_f = \\frac{1}{0.75} \\left[ \\frac{3.0}{495} (2.0) + \\frac{1.5}{400} (0.9) + \\frac{0.5}{500} (1.3) \\right]$$\n$$c_f = \\frac{1}{0.75} \\left[ \\frac{6.0}{495} + \\frac{1.35}{400} + \\frac{0.65}{500} \\right]$$\n\nNow, we calculate the values of the terms inside the brackets:\n$$\\frac{6.0}{495} \\approx 0.0121212\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}_{\\text{tissue}}$$\n$$\\frac{1.35}{400} = 0.003375\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}_{\\text{tissue}}$$\n$$\\frac{0.65}{500} = 0.0013\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}_{\\text{tissue}}$$\n\nThe sum, which represents the total charge concentration per liter of tissue, is:\n$$c_{\\text{charge, total}}^{\\text{tissue}} \\approx 0.0121212 + 0.003375 + 0.0013 = 0.0167962\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}_{\\text{tissue}}$$\n\nFinally, we divide by the water volume fraction to get the fixed charge density per liter of water:\n$$c_f = \\frac{0.0167962}{0.75} \\approx 0.0223949\\,\\text{mol L}^{-1}_{\\text{water}}$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$c_f \\approx 0.02239\\,\\text{mol}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$$",

It is a formalizable, relevant, and complete problem that is solvable using the provided data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the determination of the maximum number, $N$, of aggrecan monomers that can bind to a single hyaluronan (HA) chain of a given length, subject to specific spatial constraints. This can be modeled as a one-dimensional packing problem.\n\nFirst, we must establish the parameters of the model in consistent units. The total length of the HA chain is given as $L = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We convert this to nanometers:\n$$L = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nNext, we define the size of a single aggrecan binding site. The HA contact footprint requires a minimum of $12$ contiguous disaccharides, and each disaccharide contributes $1.0\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ to the contour length. Thus, the minimum length of one binding site, which we denote as $s$, is:\n$$s = 12\\,\\text{disaccharides} \\times 1.0\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{nm}}{\\text{disaccharide}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nThe problem states a crucial constraint on the placement of these binding sites: the minimal center-to-center separation between two adjacent aggrecan binding loci is $d = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$. The additional constraint that binding sites cannot overlap is automatically satisfied if the center-to-center separation ($d=40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) is greater than the binding-site length ($s=12\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), which it is. The distance between the end of one site and the beginning of the next is $d - s = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 28\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, confirming they do not overlap. Therefore, the dominant constraint governing a dense packing arrangement is the center-to-center separation, $d$.\n\nTo find the maximum number of aggrecans, $N$, we model the HA chain as a line segment of length $L$. We want to place $N$ intervals of length $s$ (the binding sites) along this line segment, such that the distance between the centers of any two adjacent intervals is at least $d$. To maximize $N$, we should pack the binding sites as densely as possible.\n\nLet us arrange $N$ binding sites linearly, starting from one end of the HA chain. Let the start of the first binding site be at position $0$. This site occupies the interval $[0, s]$.\nTo pack as tightly as possible, the start of the second binding site will be at position $d$. It occupies the interval $[d, d+s]$.\nContinuing this pattern, the start positions of the $N$ binding sites will be $0, d, 2d, \\dots, (N-1)d$.\n\nThe $i$-th binding site starts at position $(i-1)d$ and ends at position $(i-1)d + s$.\nThe last binding site, for $i=N$, starts at position $(N-1)d$ and ends at $(N-1)d + s$.\nFor all $N$ aggrecans to fit on the HA chain, the end of the last binding site must be less than or equal to the total length $L$ of the chain. This gives us the governing inequality:\n$$(N-1)d + s \\le L$$\n\nWe can now solve for $N$.\n$$(N-1)d \\le L - s$$\n$$N-1 \\le \\frac{L - s}{d}$$\n$$N \\le \\frac{L - s}{d} + 1$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n- $L = 2000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $s = 12\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n- $d = 40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\n$$N \\le \\frac{2000 - 12}{40} + 1$$\n$$N \\le \\frac{1988}{40} + 1$$\n$$N \\le 49.7 + 1$$\n$$N \\le 50.7$$\n\nSince $N$ must be an integer representing the number of aggrecan monomers, the maximum possible value for $N$ is the largest integer that is less than or equal to $50.7$.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\lfloor 50.7 \\rfloor = 50$$\n\nThus, a maximum of $50$ aggrecan monomers can bind to a single $2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ hyaluronan chain under the given constraints.\n\nTo verify, the total length occupied by $50$ aggrecans packed in this minimal configuration is:\n$$L_{50} = (50-1) \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 49 \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1960\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1972\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nSince $1972\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\le 2000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $50$ aggrecans fit.\nFor $51$ aggrecans:\n$$L_{51} = (51-1) \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 50 \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{nm} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2012\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\nSince $2012\\,\\mathrm{nm} > 2000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, $51$ aggrecans do not fit.

The units are consistent, so we can proceed with the numerical values.\n\nCalculate the term $4c_s^2$ and $2c_s$:\n$$\n4c_s^2 = 4 \\times (0.15)^2 = 4 \\times 0.0225 = 0.09\n$$\n$$\n2c_s = 2 \\times 0.15 = 0.30\n$$\nNow calculate the denominator, which corresponds to the native state (State 0):\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{c_{F0}^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s = \\sqrt{(0.25)^2 + 0.09} - 0.30\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sqrt{0.0625 + 0.09} - 0.30 = \\sqrt{0.1525} - 0.30\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} \\approx 0.39051248 - 0.30 = 0.09051248\n$$\nNext, calculate the numerator, which corresponds to the perturbed state (State 1):\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = \\sqrt{c_{F1}^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s = \\sqrt{(0.20)^2 + 0.09} - 0.30\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = \\sqrt{0.04 + 0.09} - 0.30 = \\sqrt{0.13} - 0.30\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} \\approx 0.36055513 - 0.30 = 0.06055513\n$$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{eq},1}}{E_{\\mathrm{eq},0}} = \\frac{0.06055513...}{0.09051248...} \\approx 0.669020...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.6690$.",
