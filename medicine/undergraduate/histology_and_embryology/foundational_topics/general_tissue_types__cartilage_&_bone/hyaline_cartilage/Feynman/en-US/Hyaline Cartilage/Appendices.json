These GAGs possess a high density of negatively charged sulfate ($\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) and carboxyl ($\\text{COO}^-$) groups. At physiological pH, these groups are ionized, creating a high negative *fixed charge density* (FCD) within the cartilage matrix.\n2.  **Donnan Osmotic Pressure:** To maintain electroneutrality, mobile positive ions (cations, e.g., $\\text{Na}^+$) from the surrounding synovial fluid are attracted into the matrix, increasing the total ion concentration within the tissue relative to the external solution. This concentration difference generates a significant osmotic pressure gradient (the Donnan effect), which draws water into the tissue.\n3.  **Swelling and Prestress:** The influx of water causes the matrix to swell. This swelling is resisted by the tensile forces developed in the entangled collagen fibrillar network. The result is a state of equilibrium where the osmotic swelling pressure is balanced by the tensile stress in the collagen fibers. This internal, mechanically-induced tension is known as prestress.\n4.  **Equilibrium Compressive Modulus:** When an external compressive load is applied and the tissue reaches equilibrium (i.e., all fluid flow has ceased), the load is borne entirely by the solid matrix. The equilibrium compressive modulus reflects the intrinsic stiffness of this solid matrix.\n5.  **Effect of Increasing Proteoglycan Content:** An increase in proteoglycan content leads to a higher FCD. This, in turn, magnifies the Donnan osmotic effect, leading to a greater osmotic swelling pressure. To reach a new equilibrium, the collagen network must stretch further to generate a higher opposing tensile stress. The matrix becomes more swollen and more highly prestressed. This highly pressurized and tensioned state makes the matrix more resistant to further deformation under an external compressive load.\n6.  **Conclusion:** Therefore, increasing proteoglycan content *increases* the equilibrium compressive modulus of hyaline cartilage.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.195$, and increasing proteoglycan content increases the equilibrium compressive modulus by elevating fixed-charge-driven osmotic swelling pressure resisted by the collagen network.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The calculated value is $\\approx 0.195$. This is correct.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus increases is correct. The stated mechanism—elevated osmotic swelling pressure due to fixed charges, resisted by the collagen network—is the scientifically accepted explanation. This is correct.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The effective solid volume fraction is exactly $0.25$, and increasing proteoglycan content decreases the compressive modulus because it dilutes the collagen network.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.25$ corresponds to the solid *mass* fraction ($25\\ \\mathrm{g} / 100\\ \\mathrm{g}$), not the solid *volume* fraction. Since the densities of the solid components are not equal to $1.00\\ \\mathrm{g}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, the mass and volume fractions are different. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus *decreases* is contrary to established principles. The reasoning is also flawed; the osmotic effect is dominant over any minor \"dilution\" effect. This is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.30$, and changing proteoglycan content has negligible effect on compressive modulus because interstitial water carries compressive loads.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.30$ is the mass fraction of proteoglycans within the dry weight, not the total solid volume fraction of the hydrated tissue. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction of a negligible effect is incorrect. The reasoning that water carries the load is only applicable to the transient (high strain rate) response due to fluid pressurization, not the *equilibrium* response, where the load is fully transferred to the solid matrix. This is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.18$, and increasing proteoglycan content reduces the high-rate compressive modulus by increasing tissue permeability.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The calculated value is $0.195$. $0.18$ is a poor approximation. This is incorrect.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** This statement incorrectly addresses the *high-rate* modulus when the question asks about the *equilibrium* modulus. Furthermore, increasing proteoglycan content *decreases*, not increases, tissue permeability, which would in fact lead to a higher, not lower, high-rate modulus. The entire statement is flawed.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. The effective solid volume fraction is approximately $0.195$, and increasing proteoglycan content decreases the equilibrium compressive modulus because added water makes the tissue more compressible.**\n-   **Volume Fraction:** The value $0.195$ is correct.\n-   **Qualitative Prediction:** The prediction that the modulus *decreases* is incorrect. The reasoning is also fundamentally flawed; the osmotically drawn water creates a pressurized, prestressed state that *stiffens* the tissue against compression, rather than making it more compressible.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

You design an experiment to infer the functional contributions of these components by sequentially digesting the ECM with proteases and glycosidases under controlled conditions and then measuring the equilibrium compressive modulus.\n\nUse the following foundations:\n- Under constant enzyme concentration, enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of a single class of abundant substrate can be modeled as pseudo-first-order degradation, so that the fraction of substrate remaining after time $t$ is $f(t) = \\exp(-k\\,E\\,t)$, where $E$ is the enzyme concentration (in enzyme units, EU), and $k$ is the pseudo-first-order rate constant (in $\\text{min}^{-1}$ per EU).\n- The fibrous network contribution to the equilibrium compressive modulus scales linearly with the intact fraction of the collagen network $f_{\\text{coll}}$.\n- In the low-salt Donnan regime, the osmotic contribution to compressive stiffness scales with the square of the effective fixed charge density. If the fixed charge density is proportional to the intact GAG fraction $f_{\\text{GAG}}$, the osmotic contribution scales with $f_{\\text{GAG}}^{2}$.\n\nAssume the following sequential treatments on a single hyaline cartilage disc:\n1. Trypsin targets proteoglycan core proteins and accessory link proteins but leaves the collagen triple helix largely intact. Treat with trypsin at $E_{T} = 1.2$ EU for $t_{T} = 30$ minutes. The rate constant for trypsin acting on GAG-bearing proteoglycan cores is $k_{T} = 0.018$ $\\text{min}^{-1}$ per EU.\n2. Hyaluronidase digests hyaluronan backbone, dispersing aggrecan aggregates and further reducing the functional GAG fraction. Treat with hyaluronidase at $E_{H} = 0.8$ EU for $t_{H} = 45$ minutes. The rate constant for hyaluronidase acting on hyaluronan-associated GAG function is $k_{H} = 0.025$ $\\text{min}^{-1}$ per EU.\n3. Collagenase digests type II collagen fibrils. Treat with collagenase at $E_{C} = 1.5$ EU for $t_{C} = 60$ minutes. The rate constant for collagenase acting on collagen is $k_{C} = 0.010$ $\\text{min}^{-1}$ per EU.\n\nAssume independence of the targeted components and multiplicative combination of sequential digestions on the same component class, so that after steps $1$ and $2$ the effective intact GAG fraction is $f_{\\text{GAG}} = f_{T}\\,f_{H}$ and, after step $3$, the intact collagen fraction is $f_{\\text{coll}} = f_{C}$, with $f_{T} = \\exp(-k_{T}E_{T}t_{T})$, $f_{H} = \\exp(-k_{H}E_{H}t_{H})$, and $f_{C} = \\exp(-k_{C}E_{C}t_{C})$.\n\nLet the baseline equilibrium compressive modulus at $f_{\\text{coll}} = 1$ and $f_{\\text{GAG}} = 1$ be composed of a collagen-network term of magnitude $\\beta = 400$ kilopascals (kPa) and an osmotic term of magnitude $\\gamma = 900$ kPa, such that at baseline the modulus is $M_{0} = \\beta + \\gamma$.\n\nUsing the principles above, derive an expression for the equilibrium compressive modulus $M$ of the explant after the three sequential treatments and evaluate it numerically.

Knowing that $1\\ \\text{hour} = 3600\\ \\text{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{3333.3\\ \\text{s}}{3600\\ \\text{s/h}} \\approx 0.926\\ \\text{h}\n$$\nSo, the characteristic time is approximately $3.3 \\times 10^3$ seconds, or about $0.9$ hours.\n\nNext, we address the physiological inference. The question is whether this time scale is compatible with sustaining cellular metabolic needs. Chondrocytes in articular cartilage have a very low metabolic rate, an evolutionary adaptation to their avascular, hypoxic environment. Their energy is derived primarily from anaerobic glycolysis. A characteristic time of approximately one hour for nutrient delivery and waste removal over a millimeter distance is not instantaneous, but it is sufficiently responsive to support the slow, steady metabolic activity of these cells. The very existence of viable cartilage tissue at thicknesses of several millimeters is empirical evidence that diffusion is a sufficient transport mechanism for this specific cell type. If diffusion were \"too slow,\" necrosis would occur, and thick, avascular cartilage would not be a viable biological structure. Therefore, the correct physiological inference is that diffusion *is* sufficiently fast to meet the specialized, low metabolic demands of chondrocytes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ (about $0.9\\ \\text{h}$); diffusion is sufficiently fast to meet daily metabolic demands in avascular hyaline cartilage.**\n-   The calculated time scale $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ is correct.\n-   The physiological inference that diffusion is sufficiently fast to support the low metabolic demands of chondrocytes is also correct. The time scale is consistent with the biological reality of viable, avascular cartilage.\n-   This option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{s}$ (about $92\\ \\text{h}$); diffusion is too slow, so daily metabolic demands cannot be met without vascularization.**\n-   The calculated time scale is incorrect by a factor of $100$. This error corresponds to mistakenly using $L=1\\ \\text{cm}$ instead of $L=1\\ \\text{mm}$ (since $(1)^2/(0.1)^2 = 100$).\n-   This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{s}$ (about $9.3\\ \\text{h}$); diffusion is too slow to meet daily metabolic demands.**\n-   The calculated time scale is incorrect by a factor of $10$.\n-   This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ (about $0.9\\ \\text{h}$); even so, avascular hyaline cartilage cannot meet daily metabolic demands by diffusion alone.**\n-   The calculated time scale $\\tau \\approx 3.3\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{s}$ is correct.\n-   The physiological inference is incorrect. It makes a statement that is contrary to the established biology of cartilage. Healthy, avascular cartilage *does* meet its metabolic needs via diffusion. If it could not, the tissue would not be viable.\n-   This option is **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A presents both a correct calculation and a correct physiological interpretation.",
