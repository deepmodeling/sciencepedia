Epidemiologists use a variety of metrics to compare health outcomes between groups, but the correct choice of metric depends on the study's design. This practice  challenges you to navigate different research scenarios—a cohort study, a case-control study, and population surveillance—and apply the appropriate measures, from absolute risk differences ($RD$) that show public health impact to relative measures like the risk ratio ($RR$) and odds ratio ($OR$).",

            "problem": "A public health team is comparing cardiovascular outcomes across racial and ethnic groups to inform preventive medicine strategies. Three studies are conducted in the same county.\n\nStudy 1 (cohort): Investigators enroll $10{,}000$ Black adults and $10{,}000$ White adults without baseline hypertension and follow them for $5$ years with negligible loss to follow-up. During follow-up, $1{,}500$ Black adults and $1{,}000$ White adults develop incident hypertension.\n\nStudy 2 (case-control): Investigators sample $800$ adults with incident stroke from hospital records and $1{,}600$ stroke-free controls from the same catchment area. Among the stroke cases, $480$ self-identify as Hispanic; among the controls, $720$ self-identify as Hispanic.\n\nStudy 3 (mortality rates with age structure): Age-specific cardiovascular mortality rates per $100{,}000$ person-years are estimated from surveillance data. For Black adults: ages $35$–$54$ have $120$ per $100{,}000$, ages $\\ge 55$ have $900$ per $100{,}000$. For White adults: ages $35$–$54$ have $90$ per $100{,}000$, ages $\\ge 55$ have $800$ per $100{,}000$. The age distribution differs between groups: Black adults are $70\\%$ ages $35$–$54$ and $30\\%$ ages $\\ge 55$, while White adults are $50\\%$ ages $35$–$54$ and $50\\%$ ages $\\ge 55$. A standard population for direct standardization is proposed with $60\\%$ ages $35$–$54$ and $40\\%$ ages $\\ge 55$.\n\nWhich options correctly define the absolute risk difference, relative risk, odds ratio, and standardized rate ratio, and correctly state when each is appropriate for cross-group comparisons in these scenarios?\n\nA. The absolute risk difference (risk difference (RD)) is the difference in cumulative incidence between groups over a specified time. For Study $1$, RD equals the Black cumulative incidence minus the White cumulative incidence, yielding $0.05$ over $5$ years (about $5$ excess cases per $100$ persons), a measure especially informative for public health impact.\n\nB. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of cumulative incidence between groups over a specified time. For Study $1$, $RR$ equals the Black cumulative incidence divided by the White cumulative incidence, yielding $1.5$, appropriate for cohort or population-based designs with well-defined at-risk periods.\n\nC. The odds ratio (OR) compares the odds of exposure between cases and controls in case-control designs. For Study $2$, $OR \\approx 1.83$ for the association between Hispanic ethnicity and stroke; $OR$ approximates $RR$ only when the outcome is rare in the source population and $RR$ cannot generally be computed from case-control sampling without external incidence information.\n\nD. The standardized rate ratio (SRR) compares directly standardized rates between groups using a common standard population to control for confounding by age when age distributions differ. For Study $3$, applying the proposed standard population yields an $SRR \\approx 1.16$, preferred over a crude rate ratio because the groups’ age structures differ.\n\nE. For Study $1$, the odds ratio is preferred over the relative risk because it is more stable when the outcome is common, and in any cohort $OR$ equals $RR$; using the cohort data gives $OR \\approx 1.59$.\n\nF. Standardization should use each group’s own age distribution rather than a common standard to avoid bias; therefore, using a common standard population is unsuitable for racial comparisons and the standardized rate ratio should not be reported.",
            "solution": "The problem statement provides data from three distinct epidemiological studies and asks for an evaluation of several statements about common measures of association and impact. The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient data for the required calculations, and objective in its presentation.\n\nFirst, let's establish the necessary calculations based on the provided data.\n\n**Study 1: Cohort Study on Hypertension**\n- Population of Black adults ($N_{Black}$): $10,000$\n- Incident hypertension cases in Black adults ($C_{Black}$): $1,500$\n- Population of White adults ($N_{White}$): $10,000$\n- Incident hypertension cases in White adults ($C_{White}$): $1,000$\n- Follow-up period: $5$ years\n\nThe cumulative incidence (risk) for each group is:\n- Cumulative Incidence in Black adults: $CI_{Black} = \\frac{C_{Black}}{N_{Black}} = \\frac{1,500}{10,000} = 0.15$\n- Cumulative Incidence in White adults: $CI_{White} = \\frac{C_{White}}{N_{White}} = \\frac{1,000}{10,000} = 0.10$\n\n**Study 2: Case-Control Study on Stroke and Hispanic Ethnicity**\n- Cases (with stroke): $800$ total. Among them, $480$ are Hispanic (exposed) and $800 - 480 = 320$ are non-Hispanic (unexposed).\n- Controls (without stroke): $1,600$ total. Among them, $720$ are Hispanic (exposed) and $1,600 - 720 = 880$ are non-Hispanic (unexposed).\n\n**Study 3: Mortality Rates with Age Standardization**\n- Age-specific rates ($R$) per $100,000$ person-years:\n  - $R_{Black, 35-54} = 120$\n  - $R_{Black, \\ge 55} = 900$\n  - $R_{White, 35-54} = 90$\n  - $R_{White, \\ge 55} = 800$\n- Age distribution (proportions, $P$) in each population:\n  - $P_{Black, 35-54} = 0.70$, $P_{Black, \\ge 55} = 0.30$\n  - $P_{White, 35-54} = 0.50$, $P_{White, \\ge 55} = 0.50$\n- Standard population weights ($W$):\n  - $W_{35-54} = 0.60$\n  - $W_{\\ge 55} = 0.40$\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The absolute risk difference (risk difference (RD)) is the difference in cumulative incidence between groups over a specified time. For Study $1$, RD equals the Black cumulative incidence minus the White cumulative incidence, yielding $0.05$ over $5$ years (about $5$ excess cases per $100$ persons), a measure especially informative for public health impact.**\n\nThe definition of absolute risk difference ($RD$) as the difference in cumulative incidences is correct.\n$RD = CI_{exposed} - CI_{unexposed}$\nUsing the data from Study $1$:\n$RD = CI_{Black} - CI_{White} = 0.15 - 0.10 = 0.05$\nThis value represents an excess risk of $0.05$ over the $5$-year period. To express this per $100$ persons, we multiply by $100$: $0.05 \\times 100 = 5$. This means there are $5$ excess cases of hypertension for every $100$ Black adults followed for $5$ years compared to White adults. The statement that this measure is informative for public health impact is also correct, as it quantifies the excess burden of disease in the exposed group. All parts of this statement are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of cumulative incidence between groups over a specified time. For Study $1$, $RR$ equals the Black cumulative incidence divided by the White cumulative incidence, yielding $1.5$, appropriate for cohort or population-based designs with well-defined at-risk periods.**\n\nThe definition of relative risk ($RR$), also known as the risk ratio, is correct for a cohort study.\n$RR = \\frac{CI_{exposed}}{CI_{unexposed}}$\nUsing the data from Study $1$:\n$RR = \\frac{CI_{Black}}{CI_{White}} = \\frac{0.15}{0.10} = 1.5$\nThe calculation is correct. The statement that a cohort study is an appropriate design for calculating $RR$ is also fundamentally correct, as cohort studies directly measure incidence in exposed and unexposed groups.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The odds ratio (OR) compares the odds of exposure between cases and controls in case-control designs. For Study $2$, $OR \\approx 1.83$ for the association between Hispanic ethnicity and stroke; $OR$ approximates $RR$ only when the outcome is rare in the source population and $RR$ cannot generally be computed from case-control sampling without external incidence information.**\n\nThe definition of the odds ratio ($OR$) in a case-control study is the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases to the odds of exposure among controls. This is correct.\nThe calculation is performed as a cross-product ratio from the $2 \\times 2$ table:\n$OR = \\frac{(\\text{Exposed Cases}) \\times (\\text{Unexposed Controls})}{(\\text{Unexposed Cases}) \\times (\\text{Exposed Controls})}$\nUsing the data from Study $2$:\n$OR = \\frac{480 \\times 880}{320 \\times 720} = \\frac{422,400}{230,400} = \\frac{11}{6} \\approx 1.833...$\nThe calculated value $OR \\approx 1.83$ is correct. The statement that the $OR$ approximates the $RR$ only when the disease is rare (the \"rare disease assumption\") is a cornerstone principle of epidemiology. Furthermore, it is true that $RR$ cannot be calculated directly from a typical case-control study because the denominators for incidence rates (the total size of the exposed and unexposed populations at risk) are unknown. All assertions in this option are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The standardized rate ratio (SRR) compares directly standardized rates between groups using a common standard population to control for confounding by age when age distributions differ. For Study $3$, applying the proposed standard population yields an $SRR \\approx 1.16$, preferred over a crude rate ratio because the groups’ age structures differ.**\n\nThe definition and purpose of direct standardization and the standardized rate ratio ($SRR$) are correctly stated. We must calculate the directly standardized rates ($DSR$) for each group using the provided standard population.\n$DSR = \\sum_{i} (\\text{Age-specific rate}_i \\times \\text{Standard population weight}_i)$\nFor the Black population:\n$DSR_{Black} = (R_{Black, 35-54} \\times W_{35-54}) + (R_{Black, \\ge 55} \\times W_{\\ge 55})$\n$DSR_{Black} = (120 \\times 0.60) + (900 \\times 0.40) = 72 + 360 = 432$ per $100,000$.\nFor the White population:\n$DSR_{White} = (R_{White, 35-54} \\times W_{35-54}) + (R_{White, \\ge 55} \\times W_{\\ge 55})$\n$DSR_{White} = (90 \\times 0.60) + (800 \\times 0.40) = 54 + 320 = 374$ per $100,000$.\nThe $SRR$ is the ratio of these standardized rates:\n$SRR = \\frac{DSR_{Black}}{DSR_{White}} = \\frac{432}{374} \\approx 1.15508...$\nThe calculated value $SRR \\approx 1.16$ is correct. The justification for its use—that it is preferred over a crude rate ratio when age structures differ—is also correct. The differing age structures act as a confounder, and standardization is the appropriate method to adjust for this. All parts of the statement are correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For Study $1$, the odds ratio is preferred over the relative risk because it is more stable when the outcome is common, and in any cohort $OR$ equals $RR$; using the cohort data gives $OR \\approx 1.59$.**\n\nThis statement contains several incorrect epidemiological assertions. First, let's calculate the $OR$ from the cohort data. The $OR$ is the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group.\nOdds of hypertension in Black adults: $\\frac{\\text{Cases}}{\\text{Non-cases}} = \\frac{1,500}{10,000 - 1,500} = \\frac{1,500}{8,500} = \\frac{3}{17}$\nOdds of hypertension in White adults: $\\frac{\\text{Cases}}{\\text{Non-cases}} = \\frac{1,000}{10,000 - 1,000} = \\frac{1,000}{9,000} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n$OR = \\frac{3/17}{1/9} = \\frac{27}{17} \\approx 1.588...$\nThe calculation $OR \\approx 1.59$ is correct. However, the justifications are flawed.\n1. The claim that \"in any cohort $OR$ equals $RR$\" is false. $OR = RR$ is only an approximation when the outcome is rare. Here, the cumulative incidences are $15\\%$ and $10\\%$, which are not rare. As shown, $OR \\approx 1.59$ while $RR = 1.5$. They are not equal. The $OR$ overestimates the $RR$.\n2. The claim that the $OR$ is \"preferred over the relative risk because it is more stable when the outcome is common\" is incorrect. In a cohort study, the $RR$ is the more direct and intuitively interpretable measure of association. The $OR$ is generally used in case-control studies where the $RR$ cannot be calculated. The \"stability\" of the OR refers to its mathematical property of invariance (i.e., the OR for disease is the same as the OR for exposure), not a reason for preference in a cohort study.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. Standardization should use each group’s own age distribution rather than a common standard to avoid bias; therefore, using a common standard population is unsuitable for racial comparisons and the standardized rate ratio should not be reported.**\n\nThis statement fundamentally misunderstands the principle of standardization. Using each group's own age distribution as weights for its age-specific rates results in the *crude rate* for that group. Comparing crude rates between populations with different age structures is precisely what introduces confounding bias, if age is associated with both the exposure and the outcome. The entire purpose of direct standardization is to apply a *common* age structure (the standard population) to the age-specific rates of all groups being compared. This removes the confounding effect of differing age distributions, allowing for a fair comparison. The statement's claims are the opposite of correct epidemiological practice.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**\n- Option A: Correct\n- Option B: Correct\n- Option C: Correct\n- Option D: Correct\n- Option E: Incorrect\n- Option F: Incorrect\n\nThe correct options are A, B, C, and D.",

            "problem": "An urban county health department is comparing all-cause annual mortality between two racial groups, Group A and Group B. Each group’s deaths and mid-year populations are observed for two age strata: ages $20$–$49$ and ages $50+$, over the same one-year period. The department wants to understand how differences in age structure can distort crude comparisons and to quantify the difference after adjusting for age using the direct method of standardization.\n\nData:\n- Group A: ages $20$–$49$: $90{,}000$ persons, $180$ deaths; ages $50+$: $10{,}000$ persons, $250$ deaths.\n- Group B: ages $20$–$49$: $20{,}000$ persons, $30$ deaths; ages $50+$: $80{,}000$ persons, $1{,}600$ deaths.\n\nUse the following standard population for direct age standardization: total standard population $100{,}000$ persons with $50{,}000$ in ages $20$–$49$ and $50{,}000$ in ages $50+$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains all necessary information to perform the requested epidemiological calculations.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested. All rates are expressed per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nPart 1: Crude Mortality Rates and Explanation\n\nThe crude mortality rate (CMR) is defined as the total number of deaths in a population over a specific period divided by the total number of person-years at risk in that population, typically multiplied by a constant (in this case, $100,000$).\nLet $D_i$ be the deaths and $N_i$ be the population in age stratum $i$. The total deaths are $D = \\sum_i D_i$ and the total population is $N = \\sum_i N_i$.\nThe CMR is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{CMR} = \\frac{\\sum_i D_i}{\\sum_i N_i} \\times 100,000 $$\n\nFor Group A:\nTotal population, $N_A = 90,000 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 10,000 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 100,000$.\nTotal deaths, $D_A = 180 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 250 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 430$.\nThe crude mortality rate for Group A is:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_A = \\frac{430}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 430 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nFor Group B:\nTotal population, $N_B = 20,000 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 80,000 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 100,000$.\nTotal deaths, $D_B = 30 \\text{ (ages } 20\\text{–}49) + 1,600 \\text{ (ages } 50+) = 1,630$.\nThe crude mortality rate for Group B is:\n$$ \\text{CMR}_B = \\frac{1,630}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,630 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nThe crude comparison, showing $\\text{CMR}_B$ to be nearly four times $\\text{CMR}_A$, is misleading because the two groups have vastly different age structures. Group A is predominantly young, with $\\frac{90,000}{100,000} = 90\\%$ of its members in the $20$–$49$ age stratum. Conversely, Group B is predominantly old, with $\\frac{80,000}{100,000} = 80\\%$ of its members in the $50+$ age stratum. Since mortality is strongly associated with age, this difference in age distribution acts as a confounding variable.\n\nTo demonstrate this confounding, we calculate the age-specific mortality rates (ASMR). The ASMR for a given age stratum $i$ is $\\text{ASMR}_i = \\frac{D_i}{N_i} \\times 100,000$.\n\nFor Group A:\n$\\text{ASMR}_{A, 20-49} = \\frac{180}{90,000} \\times 100,000 = 200$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n$\\text{ASMR}_{A, 50+} = \\frac{250}{10,000} \\times 100,000 = 2,500$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nFor Group B:\n$\\text{ASMR}_{B, 20-49} = \\frac{30}{20,000} \\times 100,000 = 150$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n$\\text{ASMR}_{B, 50+} = \\frac{1,600}{80,000} \\times 100,000 = 2,000$ per $100,000$ person-years.\n\nCrucially, within each age stratum, Group A has a *higher* mortality rate than Group B ($200 > 150$ and $2,500 > 2,000$). The crude rates suggest the opposite conclusion because Group B's population is heavily weighted toward the older, higher-mortality age group. This reversal of association is a classic example of Simpson's Paradox.\n\nPart 2: Directly Age-Standardized Mortality Rates\n\nDirect standardization addresses this confounding by calculating the mortality rate that would be observed in each group if they both had the same age structure as a common standard population. Let $m_i = D_i/N_i$ be the age-specific mortality proportion for stratum $i$ in a study group, and let $N_{S,i}$ be the population of stratum $i$ in the standard population. The number of expected deaths ($D_{\\text{exp}}$) in the standard population is the sum of the expected deaths in each stratum: $D_{\\text{exp}} = \\sum_i m_i \\cdot N_{S,i}$. The directly age-standardized mortality rate (DSMR) is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR} = \\frac{D_{\\text{exp}}}{\\sum_i N_{S,i}} \\times 100,000 $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific mortality proportions ($m_i$) for each group.\nFor Group A:\n$m_{A, 20-49} = \\frac{180}{90,000} = 0.002$\n$m_{A, 50+} = \\frac{250}{10,000} = 0.025$\n\nFor Group B:\n$m_{B, 20-49} = \\frac{30}{20,000} = 0.0015$\n$m_{B, 50+} = \\frac{1,600}{80,000} = 0.020$\n\nThe standard population ($N_S=100,000$) has $N_{S, 20-49} = 50,000$ and $N_{S, 50+} = 50,000$.\n\nTo find the DSMR for Group A, we calculate the expected deaths if Group A's rates occurred in the standard population:\n$D_{\\text{exp}, A} = (m_{A, 20-49} \\times N_{S, 20-49}) + (m_{A, 50+} \\times N_{S, 50+})$\n$D_{\\text{exp}, A} = (0.002 \\times 50,000) + (0.025 \\times 50,000) = 100 + 1,250 = 1,350$.\nThe DSMR for Group A is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR}_A = \\frac{1,350}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,350 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nTo find the DSMR for Group B, we calculate the expected deaths if Group B's rates occurred in the standard population:\n$D_{\\text{exp}, B} = (m_{B, 20-49} \\times N_{S, 20-49}) + (m_{B, 50+} \\times N_{S, 50+})$\n$D_{\\text{exp}, B} = (0.0015 \\times 50,000) + (0.020 \\times 50,000) = 75 + 1,000 = 1,075$.\nThe DSMR for Group B is:\n$$ \\text{DSMR}_B = \\frac{1,075}{100,000} \\times 100,000 = 1,075 \\text{ per } 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\nAfter adjusting for age, the mortality in Group A is higher than in Group B, consistent with the age-specific rates.\n\nPart 3: Age-Standardized Mortality Rate Ratio\n\nThe age-standardized mortality rate ratio (SMRR) of Group A to Group B is the ratio of their respective DSMRs.\n$$ \\text{SMRR}_{A:B} = \\frac{\\text{DSMR}_A}{\\text{DSMR}_B} $$\nUsing the computed values:\n$$ \\text{SMRR}_{A:B} = \\frac{1,350}{1,075} $$\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{1,350}{1,075} = \\frac{270 \\times 5}{215 \\times 5} = \\frac{270}{215} = \\frac{54 \\times 5}{43 \\times 5} = \\frac{54}{43} $$\nAs a decimal, this is $1.25581395...$.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe objective is to decompose the total mean difference in blood pressure control, $\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{\\text{W}}] - \\mathbb{E}[Y_{\\text{B}}]$, into two parts: one explained by differences in observed characteristics (covariates) and one unexplained by these characteristics.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Decomposition**\n\nThe model for the outcome is given by:\n$$\nY_{ig} = \\alpha_{g} + \\mathbf{X}_{ig} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{g} + \\varepsilon_{ig}\n$$\nBy the law of total expectation and the assumption that $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{ig}] = 0$, the expected outcome for group $g$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_g] = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha_{g} + \\mathbf{X}_{ig} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{g} + \\varepsilon_{ig}] = \\alpha_{g} + \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{ig}] \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{g}\n$$\nLet $\\overline{Y}_g = \\mathbb{E}[Y_g]$ be the mean outcome and $\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_g = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{X}_{ig}]$ be the mean covariate vector for group $g$. We use the estimated coefficients as our values for $\\alpha_g$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_g$. The group-specific mean outcomes are:\n$$\n\\overline{Y}_{\\text{W}} = \\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{Y}_{\\text{B}} = \\alpha_{\\text{B}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}}\n$$\nThe total disparity in mean outcomes is:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\overline{Y}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{Y}_{\\text{B}} = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) - (\\alpha_{\\text{B}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}})\n$$\nTo decompose this disparity, we use the Oaxaca-Blinder method. We add and subtract a counterfactual term. The problem specifies using the Non-Hispanic White group (W) as the reference for the coefficient structure. The counterfactual represents the mean outcome the Black group (B) would have if they retained their own covariate distribution ($\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}}$) but benefited from the coefficient structure of the White group ($\\alpha_{\\text{W}}, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}$). This counterfactual mean is $\\overline{Y}_{\\text{B,CF}} = \\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}$.\n\nWe add and subtract this term from the disparity equation:\n$$\n\\Delta = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) - (\\alpha_{\\text{B}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}}) + (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) - (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}})\n$$\nRearranging the terms to isolate the explained and unexplained components:\n$$\n\\Delta = [(\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) - (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}})] + [(\\alpha_{\\text{W}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) - (\\alpha_{\\text{B}} + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}})]\n$$\nSimplifying each component:\nThe first term is the **explained component** ($E$), which is the part of the disparity due to differences in covariate means:\n$$\nE = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} - \\alpha_{\\text{W}}) + (\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}) = (\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}}) \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}\n$$\nThe second term is the **unexplained component** ($U$), which is the part of the disparity due to differences in the intercepts and coefficients:\n$$\nU = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} - \\alpha_{\\text{B}}) + (\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}}) = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} - \\alpha_{\\text{B}}) + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} (\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}})\n$$\nSo, the full decomposition is $\\Delta = E + U$.\n\n**2. Numerical Computation**\n\nWe now use the provided data to compute the values of $E$ and $U$.\n\n**Calculate the Explained Component ($E$):**\nFirst, find the difference in mean covariate vectors:\n$$\n\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 52 - 50 & 0.90 - 0.80 & 0.75 - 0.65 & 0.70 - 0.60 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0.10 & 0.10 & 0.10 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, compute $E = (\\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{W}} - \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}}) \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}}$:\n$$\nE = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0.10 & 0.10 & 0.10 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.002 \\\\ 0.10 \\\\ 0.25 \\\\ 0.15 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nE = (2)(-0.002) + (0.10)(0.10) + (0.10)(0.25) + (0.10)(0.15)\n$$\n$$\nE = -0.004 + 0.010 + 0.025 + 0.015 = 0.046\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the explained component is $0.04600$.\n\n**Calculate the Unexplained Component ($U$):**\nFirst, find the differences in the intercept and coefficient vectors:\n$$\n\\alpha_{\\text{W}} - \\alpha_{\\text{B}} = 0.55 - 0.45 = 0.10\n$$\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.002 - (-0.003) \\\\ 0.10 - 0.07 \\\\ 0.25 - 0.18 \\\\ 0.15 - 0.10 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.001 \\\\ 0.03 \\\\ 0.07 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, compute $U = (\\alpha_{\\text{W}} - \\alpha_{\\text{B}}) + \\overline{\\mathbf{X}}_{\\text{B}} (\\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{W}} - \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{\\text{B}})$:\n$$\nU = 0.10 + \\begin{pmatrix} 50 & 0.80 & 0.65 & 0.60 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.001 \\\\ 0.03 \\\\ 0.07 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nU = 0.10 + \\left[ (50)(0.001) + (0.80)(0.03) + (0.65)(0.07) + (0.60)(0.05) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nU = 0.10 + [0.05 + 0.024 + 0.0455 + 0.03]\n$$\n$$\nU = 0.10 + 0.1495 = 0.2495\n$$\nThe unexplained component is $0.2495$. This value already has four significant figures.\n\nThe numerical values are:\nExplained component = $0.04600$\nUnexplained component = $0.2495$\n\n**3. Interpretation of the Unexplained Component**\n\nThe total disparity in blood pressure control is $\\Delta = 0.04600 + 0.2495 = 0.2955$. This indicates that the control rate is approximately $29.6$ percentage points higher for the Non-Hispanic White group than for the Black group.\n\nThe **explained component** ($0.04600$) quantifies the portion of this disparity attributable to differences in the average values of the observed covariates (age, insurance, medication adherence, clinic quality). It reflects how much of the gap is due to the Black group having, on average, a less favorable distribution of these specific measured characteristics.\n\nThe **unexplained component** ($0.2495$) represents the portion of the disparity that remains after accounting for these differences in covariates. It arises from the groups having different coefficients ($\\alpha_g, \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_g$). In the context of race, ethnicity, and health, this component is interpreted as a proxy for the influence of **structural factors**. These factors include systemic inequities not captured by the individual-level covariates in the model. Examples include, but are not limited to, the effects of residential segregation on health, differing quality of care *within* the same insurance plan or clinic quality stratum, implicit bias in clinical decision-making, and the cumulative physiological impact of chronic stress due to discrimination (allostatic load). Because the coefficients represent the \"returns\" to certain characteristics, a difference in coefficients suggests that the system (social, economic, healthcare) translates these characteristics into health outcomes differently for different racial groups. Therefore, the unexplained component is the one that corresponds to structural factors. In this case, it accounts for the vast majority of the total disparity ($0.2495 / 0.2955 \\approx 84.4\\%$), suggesting that differences in how the groups are treated by the system are a far more significant driver of the disparity than differences in the measured individual characteristics.",
