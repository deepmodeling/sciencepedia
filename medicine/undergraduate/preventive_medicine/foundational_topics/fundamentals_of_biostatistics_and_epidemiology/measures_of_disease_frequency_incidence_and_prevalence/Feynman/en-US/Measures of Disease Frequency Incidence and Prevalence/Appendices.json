            "problem": "A prospective cohort study in preventive medicine enrolled four participants to quantify disease occurrence as incidence rate based on person-time at risk. Each participant was followed from cohort entry until either their first event or censoring, yielding follow-up times of $1.2$, $0.8$, $2.0$, and $0.5$ years. Across these follow-up intervals, there were $3$ observed first events. Assume that first events arise as a counting process compatible with the Poisson model for rare events, and that the incidence rate is defined as the expected number of first events per unit person-time at risk. Using these data:\n- Compute the point estimate of the incidence rate in events per person-year.\n- Compute the $95\\%$ Poisson exact confidence interval (first-event rate per person-year), obtained by inverting the Poisson count model for the total number of events over the observed person-time.\n\nReport your final numerical results in the unit “events per person-year,” and round all three values (the point estimate, the lower confidence limit, and the upper confidence limit) to four significant figures. Present the three numbers in the order $(\\text{point estimate}, \\text{lower limit}, \\text{upper limit})$ as a single row vector.

Point Estimate of the Incidence Rate\n\nThe incidence rate, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is the total number of observed events, $d$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n\nFirst, calculate the total person-time at risk by summing the follow-up times for all participants:\n$$\nPT = 1.2 + 0.8 + 2.0 + 0.5 = 4.5 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe point estimate of the incidence rate is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{PT} = \\frac{3}{4.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### 2. 95% Exact Confidence Interval for the Incidence Rate\n\nThe exact confidence interval for a Poisson rate is derived from the confidence interval for the mean count, $\\mu = \\lambda \\times PT$. The exact $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu$, given an observed count $d$, is based on the chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distribution:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)}\n$$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$. With $d=3$, the degrees of freedom are $2d = 6$ for the lower limit and $2(d+1) = 8$ for the upper limit.\n\nWe use the chi-squared quantiles:\n- Lower: $\\chi^2_{0.025, 6} \\approx 1.237344$\n- Upper: $\\chi^2_{0.975, 8} \\approx 17.534546$\n\nCalculate the confidence limits for the mean count $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.237344 = 0.618672\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.534546 = 8.767273\n$$\nTo find the confidence interval for the rate $\\lambda$, we divide these limits by the total person-time, $PT = 4.5$ person-years.\n$$\n\\lambda_L = \\frac{\\mu_L}{PT} = \\frac{0.618672}{4.5} \\approx 0.1374827 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_U = \\frac{\\mu_U}{PT} = \\frac{8.767273}{4.5} \\approx 1.9482829 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### 3. Final Results\n\nRounding the point estimate, the lower limit, and the upper limit to four significant figures gives:\n- Point Estimate: $0.6667$\n- Lower Confidence Limit: $0.1375$\n- Upper Confidence Limit: $1.948$\n\nThe final result is the ordered triplet $(0.6667, 0.1375, 1.948)$.",

            "solution": "The solution requires computing the directly standardized incidence rate for Harbor City using a given standard population.\n\n#### 1. Calculate Age-Specific Incidence Rates (ASIR) for Harbor City\n\nThe ASIR for each age stratum $i$ is calculated as cases ($C_i$) divided by person-time ($PT_i$).\n- $ASIR_1 (0–19 \\text{ yrs}) = \\frac{60}{120,000} = 0.0005$\n- $ASIR_2 (20–49 \\text{ yrs}) = \\frac{450}{180,000} = 0.0025$\n- $ASIR_3 (50–79 \\text{ yrs}) = \\frac{600}{90,000} \\approx 0.006667$\n- $ASIR_4 (\\geq 80 \\text{ yrs}) = \\frac{150}{15,000} = 0.01$\n\n#### 2.

The incidence of the condition is much higher in older age groups. The standard population has a proportionally older age structure than Harbor City. Direct standardization applies Harbor City's high age-specific rates to this older standard population, resulting in a higher overall rate than the crude rate observed within Harbor City's younger population structure. This adjusted rate represents what Harbor City's rate would be if it had the age structure of the standard population.",

            "problem": "A city health department introduces enhanced case-finding for a chronic, relapsing infection modeled as a Susceptible–Infectious–Susceptible (SIS) process, where individuals cycle between a healthy state and a diseased state. Over a period during which the population size is approximately constant and the disease has negligible mortality, the following is observed: case detection increases such that the incidence rate (instantaneous rate of new cases per susceptible person-time) rises from $\\lambda_{0} = 0.025$ per person-year to $\\lambda_{1} = 0.050$ per person-year. Simultaneously, a new therapy shortens the average duration of disease episodes. At mid-year cross-sectional surveys, point prevalence (the proportion of the population diseased at a specific time) is found to be stable.\n\nAssume hazards are constant over the interval considered, and that recovery returns individuals immediately to the susceptible state. Using only the core definitions of point prevalence, incidence rate, and average duration, and a conservation-of-flow argument between the healthy and diseased states under steady-state conditions, first derive the steady-state expression that links point prevalence $p$, incidence rate $\\lambda$, and mean duration $D$ for this two-state process. Then, given the baseline mean duration $D_{0} = 2$ years and the post-intervention incidence rate $\\lambda_{1} = 0.050$ per person-year, compute the post-intervention mean duration $D_{1}$ (in years) required to keep point prevalence unchanged from its baseline value implied by $\\lambda_{0}$ and $D_{0}$.

Derivation of the Steady-State Relationship\n\nLet $S$ be the number of susceptible individuals and $I$ be the number of infectious individuals in a total population of size $N = S + I$.\n-   Point prevalence is $p = I/N$. The proportion of susceptibles is $1-p = S/N$.\n-   The rate of new infections is the incidence rate ($\\lambda$) multiplied by the number of susceptibles: $\\text{Flow In} = \\lambda S = \\lambda N(1-p)$.\n-   The rate of recovery is the number of infectious individuals ($I$) divided by the mean duration of disease ($D$): $\\text{Flow Out} = I/D = pN/D$.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the flow into the infectious compartment equals the flow out:\n$$ \\text{Flow In} = \\text{Flow Out} $$\n$$ \\lambda N(1-p) = \\frac{pN}{D} $$\nThe total population size $N$ cancels out, yielding the desired relationship:\n$$ \\lambda (1-p) = \\frac{p}{D} $$\nThis can be rearranged to show that the prevalence odds equals the product of the incidence rate and duration:\n$$ \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\lambda D $$\n\n#### 2.
