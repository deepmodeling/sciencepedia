This first exercise guides you through one of the most fundamental tasks in planning a medical study: determining the required sample size. By working through the derivation for a clinical trial with a continuous outcome like blood pressure, you will see firsthand how the desired confidence ($\\alpha$), desired power ($1-\\beta$), expected effect size ($\\delta$), and data variability ($\\sigma$) are mathematically linked to decide \"how many participants do we need?\" . This practice provides a solid foundation for designing statistically robust trials.",

Investigators will use a two-sided hypothesis test of the difference in population means with type I error rate $\\alpha = 0.05$. Assume individual patient outcomes within each arm are independent and identically distributed, approximately normal, with a common and known standard deviation $\\sigma = 10$ millimeters of mercury.

The sample sizes are equal, $n_1 = n_2 = n$. The outcomes are assumed to be normally distributed with a common known standard deviation $\\sigma$. The hypotheses for a two-sided test are:\n$$ H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0 $$\n$$ H_a: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0 $$\n\nThe test statistic is the standardized difference in sample means, $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$. The sampling distribution of the difference is $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 \\sim N(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}) = N(\\mu_1 - \\mu_2, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\nUnder the null hypothesis $H_0$, the test statistic is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}} $$\nwhich follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nA Type I error occurs if we reject $H_0$ when it is true. For a two-sided test at a significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. This defines the rejection region in terms of the observed sample difference as $|\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}$.\n\nA Type II error occurs if we fail to reject $H_0$ when it is false. Statistical power, $1-\\beta$, is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is true. We calculate power for a specific alternative, namely that the true difference is $\\delta$. So, we assume $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\delta$.\n\nUnder this alternative, the sampling distribution is $\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2 \\sim N(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$. The power is the probability that the observed difference falls in the rejection region. Assuming $\\delta > 0$, the power is dominated by detections in the upper tail.

The primary analysis will test the null hypothesis $H_{0}: p_{1} - p_{0} = 0$ against the two-sided alternative $H_{1}: p_{1} - p_{0} \\neq 0$ using a large-sample normal approximation to the difference in sample proportions.

By the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_{1} - \\hat{p}_{0}$, is approximately normal.\n\nThe hypothesis test is for $H_{0}: p_{1} - p_{0} = 0$ versus $H_{1}: p_{1} - p_{0} \\neq 0$.\n\nFirst, we define the rejection region under $H_{0}$. For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_{0}$ if the observed difference is sufficiently far from $0$. Under $H_0$, there is a common proportion $p$.

By standardizing, we relate the critical value $C$ to the quantiles of the standard normal distribution under both the null and alternative hypotheses. This leads to the planning inequality:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} SE_0 \\approx (p_{1} - p_{0}) - z_{1-\\beta} SE_{1} $$\n$$ p_{1} - p_{0} \\approx z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{0}(1-p_{0})}{n}} $$\nFactoring out $1/\\sqrt{n}$ and solving for $n$ gives the sample size formula:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{0}(1-p_{0})} \\right)^2}{(p_{1} - p_{0})^2} $$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the given values: $p_{0} = 0.40$, $p_{1} = 0.50$, $\\alpha = 0.05$ (two-sided), and $\\beta = 0.20$.\n- Difference: $p_{1} - p_{0} = 0.10$.\n- Average probability: $\\bar{p} = (0.50 + 0.40)/2 = 0.45$.\n- Standard normal quantiles: $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.960$ and $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.842$.\n- Variance components:\n    - Null: $2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2(0.45)(0.55) = 0.495$.\n    - Alternative: $p_{1}(1-p_{1}) + p_{0}(1-p_{0}) = 0.50(0.50) + 0.40(0.60) = 0.25 + 0.24 = 0.49$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.960 \\sqrt{0.495} + 0.842 \\sqrt{0.49} \\right)^2}{(0.10)^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.960 \\times 0.70356 + 0.842 \\times 0.7 \\right)^2}{0.01} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.37898 + 0.5894 \\right)^2}{0.01} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{(1.96838)^2}{0.01} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{3.8745}{0.01} \\approx 387.45 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $n \\approx 387.5$.

So, $\\beta \\approx 0.82$.\nThe power is $1 - \\beta \\approx 1 - 0.82 = 0.18$.\nThis statement is **correct**. An extremely small sample size leads to very low power.\n\n**B) If $\\alpha = 0.05$ is held fixed by design, then reducing $n$ increases the probability of a Type I error.**\n\nThe Type I error rate, $\\alpha$, is the significance level of the test. It is a value chosen by the investigator *by design*. The statistical test procedure is constructed to ensure that the probability of a Type I error is controlled at this level, regardless of the sample size $n$. Reducing $n$ increases the standard error, which makes it harder to detect a true effect, thereby *increasing* the Type II error rate ($\\beta$) and decreasing power. It does not affect $\\alpha$.\nThis statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**C) To achieve at least $80\\%$ power for detecting $\\delta = 1$ with $\\sigma = 1.2$ at $\\alpha = 0.05$ (two-sided), a per-group sample size of about $n = 23$ suffices under the normal approximation.**\n\nWe need to find the minimal $n$ for power $\\ge 0.80$, which means $\\beta \\le 0.20$. This corresponds to $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.842$. Using the sample size formula derived from the power relationship:\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\delta^2} $$\n$$ n \\ge \\frac{2(1.2)^2(1.96 + 0.842)^2}{1^2} = 2(1.44)(2.802)^2 \\approx 2.88 \\times 7.851 = 22.61 $$\nSince the sample size must be an integer, we must round up to ensure the power is at least $80\\%$. Therefore, the required sample size is $n=23$.\nThis statement is **correct**.\n\n**D) For fixed $n$ and $\\alpha$, increasing the true effect size $\\delta$ decreases the Type II error probability $\\beta$.**\n\nWhen $n$ and $\\alpha$ are fixed, the standard error and the rejection region are also fixed. The Type II error probability, $\\beta$, is the area of the alternative distribution that falls within the non-rejection region. The alternative distribution is centered at the true effect size, $\\delta$. If $\\delta$ increases, the center of this distribution moves further away from the null hypothesis center (0) and further into the rejection region. This means less of the alternative distribution's probability mass will overlap with the non-rejection region. Therefore, $\\beta$ decreases, and power ($1-\\beta$) increases. A larger effect is easier to detect.\nThis statement is **correct**.",
