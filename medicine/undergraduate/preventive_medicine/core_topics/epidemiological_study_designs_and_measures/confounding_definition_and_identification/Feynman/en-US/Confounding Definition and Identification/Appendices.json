Let $E$ denote receipt of influenza vaccination, $D$ denote hospitalization due to influenza, $C$ denote age, $U$ denote general health-seeking propensity (which affects care-seeking and adherence but is not directly caused by vaccination), and $S$ denote study participation status. The team believes the following causal relations hold and can be represented in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG): $C \\to E$, $C \\to D$, $E \\to D$, $E \\to S$, $U \\to S$, and $U \\to D$. The team plans to estimate the causal effect of $E$ on $D$ using an observational cohort design and must decide which variables to adjust for.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions in causal inference applied to preventive medicine:\n- A confounder is any variable that causally influences both an exposure and an outcome and is not on the causal pathway between them, thereby creating a noncausal association if unblocked.\n- A collider is any variable that has two arrows pointing into it from distinct causes; conditioning on a collider or its descendants can induce an association between its parents even if none exists causally.\n- A valid adjustment set under the backdoor criterion blocks all backdoor paths from $E$ to $D$ without conditioning on colliders or their descendants.\n\nIn the DAG above, identify the adjustment set(s) that eliminate confounding of the causal effect of $E$ on $D$ without inducing collider bias.

            "solution": "To identify the correct adjustment set(s), we must use the backdoor criterion. This involves analyzing the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to block all non-causal (\"backdoor\") paths from the exposure $E$ to the outcome $D$, without creating new bias by conditioning on a collider.\n\n**1. Construct the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**\n\nBased on the provided causal relations, the DAG is as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{CD}\nC \\\\\n@VVV @VVV \\\\\nE @>>> D \\\\\n@VVV @AAA \\\\\nS @ U\n\\end{CD}\n$$\nThe causal path of interest is the direct arrow $E \\to D$.\n\n**2. Identify All Paths Between $E$ and $D$**\n\nWe must find all paths connecting $E$ and $D$ to identify which are open backdoor paths and which contain colliders.\n\n- **Path 1 (Causal Path):** $E \\to D$. This is the direct causal effect we wish to estimate and must not be blocked.\n\n- **Path 2 (Backdoor Path):** $E \\leftarrow C \\to D$. This is a non-causal path. Since $C$ is a common cause of $E$ and $D$, and is not a collider, this path is open and creates confounding. It must be blocked by conditioning on $C$.\n\n- **Path 3 (Collider Path):** $E \\to S \\leftarrow U \\to D$. This is another non-causal path. The variable $S$ is a collider because two arrows point into it ($E \\to S$ and $U \\to S$). A path containing an unconditioned collider is naturally blocked. Conditioning on $S$ would *open* this path and induce collider bias.\n\n**3. Apply the Backdoor Criterion and Evaluate Options**\n\nA valid adjustment set must block the path through $C$ (by including $C$) and must not open the path through $S$ (by not including $S$).\n\n*   **A. Adjust for $C$ only:** This correctly blocks the backdoor path through $C$ and avoids the collider $S$. **This set is valid.**\n*   **B. Adjust for $S$ only:** This fails to block the backdoor path through $C$ and induces collider bias. This is invalid.\n*   **C. Adjust for $C$ and $U$:** This correctly blocks the path through $C$. Conditioning on $U$ is not necessary, but it is harmless as $U$ is not a collider on any path between $E$ and $D$. **This set is valid.**\n*   **D. Adjust for $C$ and $S$:** This induces collider bias by conditioning on $S$. This is invalid.\n*   **E. No adjustment:** This fails to block the confounding path through $C$.

A minimal set is a sufficient set where no proper subset is also sufficient.\n\n**1. Identify Backdoor Paths**\n\nFirst, we identify all backdoor paths from $A$ to $Y$ in the specified DAG. A backdoor path starts with an arrow pointing into $A$.

Determine the Minimal Sufficient Adjustment Set**\n\nTo block all four open backdoor paths simultaneously, we must find a set of covariates that covers all of them.\n- To block Path 1 ($A \\leftarrow C_1 \\to Y$), the adjustment set **must contain $C_1$**.\n- To block Path 2 ($A \\leftarrow C_2 \\to Y$), the adjustment set **must contain $C_2$**.\n\nAny sufficient adjustment set must therefore contain both $C_1$ and $C_2$. Let's test the set $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$:\n- It blocks Path 1 (contains $C_1$).\n- It blocks Path 2 (contains $C_2$).\n- It blocks Paths 3 and 4 (contains both $C_1$ and $C_2$).\nSo, $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$ is a sufficient adjustment set.\n\nTo be a *minimal* sufficient set, no proper subset of it can be sufficient.\n- The subset $\\{C_1\\}$ is not sufficient because it leaves Path 2 open.\n- The subset $\\{C_2\\}$ is not sufficient because it leaves Path 1 open.\n- The empty set $\\varnothing$ is not sufficient.\n\nTherefore, $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$ is the minimal sufficient adjustment set.\n\n**3. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A. $\\{C_1\\}$:** Insufficient, leaves path $A \\leftarrow C_2 \\to Y$ open.\n*   **B. $\\{C_2\\}$:** Insufficient, leaves path $A \\leftarrow C_1 \\to Y$ open.\n*   **C. $\\{C_1, C_2\\}$:** Correct. This is the minimal sufficient adjustment set.\n*   **D. $\\varnothing$ (no covariates):** Insufficient, leaves all backdoor paths open.\n*   **E. $\\{C_1, C_2, Y\\}$:** Invalid.

A binary pre-exposure factor $C \\in \\{0,1\\}$ is measured at baseline and is plausibly related to both $A$ and $Y$. Within levels of $C$, the risks of $Y$ are empirically well-estimated (by large-sample proportions) and given as follows: in stratum $C=0$, the risk is $0.05$ for $A=1$ and $0.10$ for $A=0$; in stratum $C=1$, the risk is $0.20$ for $A=1$ and $0.30$ for $A=0$. The distribution of $C$ differs by exposure: among the $A=1$ group there are $900$ individuals with $C=1$ and $100$ with $C=0$; among the $A=0$ group there are $100$ with $C=1$ and $900$ with $C=0$.

Compute the standardized risk difference for $A=1$ versus $A=0$ by first standardizing each group’s risk to the total population distribution of $C$ (which is induced by the combined sample) and then taking their difference.\n\n4.
