This practice provides a foundational exercise in calculating cumulative incidence, the proportion of a group that develops an outcome over time, and the risk ratio, which directly compares these risks . Mastering this calculation is the first step toward interpreting the results of both prospective and retrospective cohort studies.",

            "problem": "A public health team is evaluating a screening intervention using two cohort study designs in the same population: a prospective cohort that enrolls participants at baseline and follows them forward for $2$ years, and a retrospective cohort that uses existing records to identify exposure status $2$ years ago and reconstruct outcomes up to the present. The cohort is closed, all individuals are free of the outcome at baseline, there is complete follow-up, and there are no competing risks or losses to follow-up.\n\nIn the exposed group, $2{,}000$ individuals are enrolled, and $80$ incident outcomes occur during the $2$-year period. In the unexposed group, $1{,}800$ individuals are enrolled, and $60$ incident outcomes occur during the same $2$-year period. Assume that the retrospective ascertainment yields the same counts as the prospective follow-up under these conditions.\n\nUsing only core definitions from cohort study design in preventive medicine, compute the cumulative incidence in the exposed group and in the unexposed group over $2$ years, and interpret how the difference reflects the effect of exposure in a cohort framework. Finally, report the risk ratio (ratio of cumulative incidence in the exposed to cumulative incidence in the unexposed) as a simplified fraction. Express the final risk ratio as an exact fraction; no rounding is required. Do not include units in your final reported value.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with all necessary information, and presented objectively. The scenario is a classic textbook example used to illustrate the calculation of fundamental measures of association in cohort studies. The assumptions provided—such as a closed cohort and no loss to follow-up—are standard for introductory problems to isolate the core concepts.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of cumulative incidence for two groups (exposed and unexposed) and the subsequent calculation of the risk ratio.\n\nFirst, we define cumulative incidence ($CI$), which is the proportion of a population initially at risk that develops the outcome over a specified time period. The formula is:\n$$\nCI = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases of the outcome}}{\\text{Number of individuals in the population at risk at the start of the period}}\n$$\nThe problem states that all individuals are free of the outcome at baseline, so the entire cohort in each group is at risk.\n\nFor the exposed group, the number of individuals enrolled at baseline is $N_{exp} = 2,000$. The number of incident outcomes during the $2$-year follow-up period is $A_{exp} = 80$. The cumulative incidence in the exposed group, $CI_{exp}$, is therefore:\n$$\nCI_{exp} = \\frac{A_{exp}}{N_{exp}} = \\frac{80}{2,000} = \\frac{8}{200} = \\frac{1}{25}\n$$\nThis means that the risk of developing the outcome over the $2$-year period for an individual in the exposed group is $\\frac{1}{25}$, or $4\\%$.\n\nFor the unexposed group, the number of individuals enrolled at baseline is $N_{unexp} = 1,800$. The number of incident outcomes during the same $2$-year period is $A_{unexp} = 60$. The cumulative incidence in the unexposed group, $CI_{unexp}$, is:\n$$\nCI_{unexp} = \\frac{A_{unexp}}{N_{unexp}} = \\frac{60}{1,800} = \\frac{6}{180} = \\frac{1}{30}\n$$\nThis means that the risk of developing the outcome over the $2$-year period for an individual in the unexposed group is $\\frac{1}{30}$, or approximately $3.33\\%$.\n\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of how the difference reflects the effect of exposure. A direct comparison shows that $CI_{exp} > CI_{unexp}$ ($\\frac{1}{25} > \\frac{1}{30}$). This indicates that the exposure is associated with an increased risk of developing the outcome. In the framework of a cohort study, where exposure precedes the outcome, this association suggests that the exposure is a risk factor for the outcome. The problem states that a prospective design (following individuals forward) and a retrospective design (looking back at records) yield the same counts under these ideal conditions, which underscores the theoretical equivalence of the two designs for measuring incidence.\n\nFinally, we compute the risk ratio ($RR$), also known as the relative risk. The risk ratio is the ratio of the cumulative incidence in the exposed group to the cumulative incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$\nRR = \\frac{CI_{exp}}{CI_{unexp}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for $CI_{exp}$ and $CI_{unexp}$:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{1/25}{1/30} = \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{30}{1} = \\frac{30}{25}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{30 \\div 5}{25 \\div 5} = \\frac{6}{5}\n$$\nA risk ratio of $\\frac{6}{5}$ (or $1.2$) signifies that the risk of the outcome in the exposed group is $1.2$ times the risk in the unexposed group over the specified $2$-year period.",

            "introduction": "Real-world cohort studies often involve exposures that begin or change during the follow-up period, introducing analytical challenges. This problem tackles a critical methodological pitfall known as \"immortal time bias,\" which can arise when the classification of exposure time is misaligned with the start of follow-up .

            "problem": "A cohort study asks how initiating a preventive medication affects all-cause mortality. In cohort designs, a fundamental element is the time origin that anchors follow-up. Define the index date and time origin precisely, then apply those definitions to evaluate potential bias when exposure initiation occurs after cohort entry.\n\nConsider a hospital system that assembles a cohort with index date at first clinic visit. Let $t=0$ denote this cohort entry date (time origin) for all participants. The exposure is initiation of a preventive medication. During follow-up, $800$ participants initiate the medication at $t=6$ months, and $1200$ participants never initiate. Mortality is assessed through $t=24$ months. Among the $800$ initiators, there are $20$ deaths between $t=6$ and $t=24$ months. Among the $1200$ non-initiators, there are $60$ deaths between $t=0$ and $t=24$ months. Assume complete follow-up without loss, and ignore competing risks. For simplicity, treat follow-up as fixed: initiators contribute $24$ months each, with exposure status changing at $t=6$ months; non-initiators contribute $24$ months each as unexposed.\n\nA naive time-fixed analysis classifies exposure as “ever initiated during follow-up” and counts person-time from $t=0$ for initiators as exposed. A correct time-dependent analysis classifies exposure dynamically, counting person-time prior to $t=6$ months as unexposed and person-time after $t=6$ months as exposed for the $800$ initiators. Use the definition of incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR), where the incidence rate is events divided by person-time and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) is the exposed rate divided by the unexposed rate.\n\nWhich option correctly:\n(1) defines the index date and time origin in cohort studies,\n(2) identifies how misalignment between $t=0$ and the true exposure initiation can induce immortal time bias, and\n(3) computes the naive time-fixed IRR and the correct time-dependent IRR using the data above?\n\nA. The index date is the common $t=0$ time origin at cohort entry for all participants; exposure status is defined by when the exposure actually starts. If analysis instead classifies initiators as exposed from $t=0$, the period $t \\in [0,6)$ months for initiators becomes “immortal” for the exposed group because, by definition, initiators must survive to $t=6$ months to receive the medication. This misalignment shifts event-free person-time into the exposed group, biasing the association toward a protective effect. Naive exposed person-time is $800 \\times 24 = 19200$ person-months with $20$ deaths; naive unexposed person-time is $1200 \\times 24 = 28800$ person-months with $60$ deaths. The naive IRR is $(20/19200)/(60/28800) = 0.5$. Correct time-dependent exposed person-time is $800 \\times (24-6) = 14400$ person-months with $20$ deaths; correct unexposed person-time is $(800 \\times 6) + (1200 \\times 24) = 4800 + 28800 = 33600$ person-months with $60$ deaths. The correct IRR is $(20/14400)/(60/33600) \\approx 0.78$.\n\nB. The index date should be defined separately for each group: $t=0$ is the first exposure date for the exposed and the first clinic visit for the unexposed. Misalignment primarily creates confounding by indication, not immortal time bias. With these data, both the naive and correct IRRs are identical at $0.5$ because exposure status is eventually determined for all participants and the person-time denominators are unaffected.\n\nC. In retrospective cohorts, the time origin is inherently the first exposure date, so immortal time bias cannot occur. Misalignment, if present, would inflate risk estimates. Using the data, the correct IRR exceeds $1.0$, for example about $1.3$, because assigning pre-initiation time to the unexposed dilutes the unexposed death rate.\n\nD. The index date is when the outcome is first detected, and the time origin is set by the earliest event in the dataset to maximize efficiency. Immortal time bias arises only if outcomes are rare and follow-up is short. With the given data, the naive IRR is $2.0$, since the exposed group has more person-time, and the correct IRR is $1.0$ after random reassignment of a pseudo-index date.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, specifically cohort study design and the methodological issue of immortal time bias. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided to perform the required calculations and conceptual analysis. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe core task is to evaluate the provided options based on three criteria:\n1.  Correct definition of index date and time origin.\n2.  Correct identification and explanation of immortal time bias.\n3.  Correct calculation of the naive (time-fixed) and correct (time-dependent) incidence rate ratios (IRR).\n\nLet's first establish the principles and perform the calculations from the given data.\n\n**Key Definitions**\n- **Time Origin ($t=0$)**: The start of follow-up for a participant. In this problem, it is the date of the first clinic visit. A common time origin for all participants, defined prior to exposure, is a hallmark of a valid cohort design.\n- **Index Date**: Synonymous with the time origin in this context.\n- **Incidence Rate (IR)**: The number of new events divided by the total person-time at risk.\n$$ IR = \\frac{\\text{Number of Events}}{\\text{Person-Time}} $$\n- **Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR)**: The ratio of the incidence rate in the exposed group to the incidence rate in the unexposed group.\n$$ IRR = \\frac{IR_{exposed}}{IR_{unexposed}} $$\n- **Immortal Time Bias**: A form of selection bias where a period of follow-up time for a subject is misclassified. Specifically, when a subject must survive for a certain time before initiating an exposure, that survival period is \"immortal\" time. If an analysis incorrectly classifies the subject as \"exposed\" from the beginning of follow-up ($t=0$), this immortal, event-free person-time is wrongly added to the exposed group's denominator. This artificially decreases the calculated incidence rate for the exposed group, typically biasing the IRR towards a spurious protective effect ($IRR  1$).\n\n**Given Data**\n- Total participants: $800 + 1200 = 2000$.\n- Cohort entry (time origin): $t=0$.\n- Total follow-up duration: $24$ months.\n- Initiators: $N_I = 800$. They initiate medication at $t=6$ months.\n- Non-initiators: $N_{NI} = 1200$. They never initiate.\n- Deaths in initiators: $D_I = 20$, all occurring between $t=6$ and $t=24$ months.\n- Deaths in non-initiators: $D_{NI} = 60$, all occurring between $t=0$ and $t=24$ months.\n\n**Calculation of Naive Time-Fixed IRR**\nThis analysis incorrectly classifies the $800$ initiators as \"exposed\" for their entire follow-up period from $t=0$.\n\n- **Exposed Group (Initiators)**:\n  - Events: $D_{exp} = 20$.\n  - Person-time: $PT_{exp} = 800 \\text{ persons} \\times 24 \\frac{\\text{months}}{\\text{person}} = 19200 \\text{ person-months}$.\n  - Incidence Rate: $IR_{exp} = \\frac{20}{19200} \\text{ months}^{-1}$.\n\n- **Unexposed Group (Non-initiators)**:\n  - Events: $D_{unexp} = 60$.\n  - Person-time: $PT_{unexp} = 1200 \\text{ persons} \\times 24 \\frac{\\text{months}}{\\text{person}} = 28800 \\text{ person-months}$.\n  - Incidence Rate: $IR_{unexp} = \\frac{60}{28800} \\text{ months}^{-1}$.\n\n- **Naive IRR**:\n$$ IRR_{naive} = \\frac{IR_{exp}}{IR_{unexp}} = \\frac{20/19200}{60/28800} = \\frac{20 \\times 28800}{60 \\times 19200} = \\frac{1 \\times 28800}{3 \\times 19200} = \\frac{288}{3 \\times 192} = \\frac{96}{192} = 0.5 $$\n\n**Calculation of Correct Time-Dependent IRR**\nThis analysis correctly classifies person-time according to the dynamic exposure status.\n\n- **Exposed Person-Time and Events**:\n  - Only the $800$ initiators contribute exposed person-time, and only after they initiate the medication.\n  - Period of exposure: From $t=6$ to $t=24$ months, which is $24 - 6 = 18$ months.\n  - Exposed Person-Time: $PT_{exp} = 800 \\text{ persons} \\times 18 \\frac{\\text{months}}{\\text{person}} = 14400 \\text{ person-months}$.\n  - Exposed Events: The $20$ deaths among initiators all occurred during this period. $D_{exp} = 20$.\n  - Incidence Rate: $IR_{exp} = \\frac{20}{14400} \\text{ months}^{-1}$.\n\n- **Unexposed Person-Time and Events**:\n  - Unexposed person-time comes from two sources:\n    1.  The $1200$ non-initiators for their entire follow-up: $1200 \\text{ persons} \\times 24 \\text{ months} = 28800 \\text{ person-months}$.\n    2.  The $800$ initiators *before* they initiate the medication: from $t=0$ to $t=6$ months. This is $800 \\text{ persons} \\times 6 \\text{ months} = 4800 \\text{ person-months}$.\n  - Total Unexposed Person-Time: $PT_{unexp} = 28800 + 4800 = 33600 \\text{ person-months}$.\n  - Unexposed Events: The $60$ deaths among non-initiators occurred while they were unexposed. By definition, initiators must survive the $t=0$ to $t=6$ period to initiate, so there are $0$ deaths among them during their unexposed period. Total unexposed deaths $D_{unexp} = 60 + 0 = 60$.\n  - Incidence Rate: $IR_{unexp} = \\frac{60}{33600} \\text{ months}^{-1}$.\n\n- **Correct IRR**:\n$$ IRR_{correct} = \\frac{IR_{exp}}{IR_{unexp}} = \\frac{20/14400}{60/33600} = \\frac{20 \\times 33600}{60 \\times 14400} = \\frac{1 \\times 33600}{3 \\times 14400} = \\frac{336}{3 \\times 144} = \\frac{112}{144} = \\frac{7 \\times 16}{9 \\times 16} = \\frac{7}{9} $$\n$$ IRR_{correct} \\approx 0.777... $$\n\nThe naive analysis suggests a strong protective effect ($IRR = 0.5$), while the correct analysis shows a much weaker, though still protective, effect ($IRR \\approx 0.78$). The difference is due to the immortal time bias in the naive approach.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. The index date is the common $t=0$ time origin at cohort entry for all participants; exposure status is defined by when the exposure actually starts. If analysis instead classifies initiators as exposed from $t=0$, the period $t \\in [0,6)$ months for initiators becomes “immortal” for the exposed group because, by definition, initiators must survive to $t=6$ months to receive the medication.

Correct time-dependent exposed person-time is $800 \\times (24-6) = 14400$ person-months with $20$ deaths; correct unexposed person-time is $(800 \\times 6) + (1200 \\times 24) = 4800 + 28800 = 33600$ person-months with $60$ deaths. The correct IRR is $(20/14400)/(60/33600) \\approx 0.78$.\n- This option correctly defines the index date and time origin.\n- It provides a precise and accurate explanation of immortal time bias and its effect in this specific scenario.\n- It correctly calculates the naive person-time for exposed ($19200$) and unexposed ($28800$) groups, and the resulting naive IRR of $0.5$.\n- It correctly calculates the time-dependent person-time for exposed ($14400$) and unexposed ($33600$) periods, and the resulting correct IRR of approximately $0.78$.\n- **Verdict: Correct**\n\nB.

With these data, both the naive and correct IRRs are identical at $0.5$ because exposure status is eventually determined for all participants and the person-time denominators are unaffected.\n- The proposed definition of the index date is methodologically flawed and would make the groups non-comparable.\n- It incorrectly dismisses immortal time bias, which is the central issue of the problem structure.\n- It incorrectly claims the naive and correct IRRs are identical at $0.5$. Our calculations show they are $0.5$ and $7/9 \\approx 0.78$, respectively.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. In retrospective cohorts, the time origin is inherently the first exposure date, so immortal time bias cannot occur. Misalignment, if present, would inflate risk estimates.

The reasoning about \"diluting\" the unexposed rate is a misinterpretation of the correct analytical procedure.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. The index date is when the outcome is first detected, and the time origin is set by the earliest event in the dataset to maximize efficiency.

It is a structural bias, not one limited to rare outcomes or short follow-up.\n- The calculated IRRs ($2.0$ and $1.0$) are wrong. The naive IRR is $0.5$ and the correct IRR is $7/9$. The phrase \"random reassignment of a pseudo-index date\" is methodologically nonsensical in this context.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly addresses all three components of the question.",

A full derivation and solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nLet $p_1$ and $p_0$ be the true proportions of the outcome in the exposed and unexposed cohorts, respectively. The sample sizes are $n_1$ and $n_0$. The problem states that allocation is equal, so $n_1 = n_0 = n$. The sample proportions are denoted by $\\hat{p}_1$ and $\\hat{p}_0$.\n\nFrom the givens, the risk in the unexposed cohort is $p_0 = 0.10$. The risk ratio is $RR = p_1/p_0 = 1.5$. Therefore, the hypothesized risk in the exposed cohort under the alternative hypothesis is $p_1 = RR \\times p_0 = 1.5 \\times 0.10 = 0.15$.\n\nThe study aims to test the following two-sided hypotheses:\n-   Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $p_1 = p_0$ (i.e., $p_1 - p_0 = 0$).\n-   Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$): $p_1 \\neq p_0$ (i.e., $p_1 - p_0 \\neq 0$).\n\nThe test statistic is the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{d} = \\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_0$. By the Central Limit Theorem, $\\hat{d}$ is approximately normally distributed.\n\nThe distribution of $\\hat{d}$ under the alternative hypothesis $H_a$ is:\n$$ \\hat{d} \\sim N(\\mu_a, \\sigma_a^2) $$\nwhere the mean is $\\mu_a = p_1 - p_0$ and the variance is $\\sigma_a^2 = \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_0) = \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\hat{p}_0) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n_0}$.\nWith $n_1 = n_0 = n$, the standard error under $H_a$ is $\\sigma_a = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}$.\n\nFor a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|\\hat{d}|  C$, where $C$ is the critical value. This critical value is determined by the distribution of $\\hat{d}$ under $H_0$. Under $H_0$, $p_1=p_0$, and the distribution is:\n$$ \\hat{d} \\sim N(\\mu_0, \\sigma_0^2) $$\nwhere the mean is $\\mu_0 = 0$. The variance $\\sigma_0^2$ is based on a pooled proportion, since under $H_0$ both samples come from a population with the same proportion. For study design purposes, we estimate this pooled proportion as $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1 + p_0}{2}$. The variance is thus $\\sigma_0^2 = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n} = \\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}$. The standard error is $\\sigma_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}}$.\n\nThe critical value $C$ is defined by the significance level: $P(|\\hat{d}|  C | H_0) = \\alpha$. This implies $C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma_0$.\n\nThe statistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_a$ is true: $P(|\\hat{d}|  C | H_a) = 1-\\beta$. For the case where $p_1  p_0$, the term $P(\\hat{d}  -C | H_a)$ is negligible, so the power condition can be approximated by the one-sided condition $P(\\hat{d}  C | H_a) = 1-\\beta$.\nStandardizing $\\hat{d}$ under $H_a$:\n$$ P\\left(\\frac{\\hat{d} - (p_1-p_0)}{\\sigma_a}  \\frac{C - (p_1-p_0)}{\\sigma_a}\\right) = 1-\\beta $$\nThe expression inside the probability is a standard normal variable $Z$. We know that $P(Z  -z_{1-\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$. Therefore:\n$$ \\frac{C - (p_1-p_0)}{\\sigma_a} = -z_{1-\\beta} $$\n$$ C = (p_1 - p_0) - z_{1-\\beta} \\sigma_a $$\n\nWe now have two expressions for the critical value $C$. Equating them allows us to solve for the sample size $n$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma_0 = (p_1 - p_0) - z_{1-\\beta} \\sigma_a $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma_0$ and $\\sigma_a$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} = (p_1 - p_0) - z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}{n}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $n$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)} \\right) = p_1 - p_0 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)}}{p_1 - p_0} $$\nSquaring both sides gives the final expression for the per-cohort sample size $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0)} \\right)^2}{(p_1 - p_0)^2} $$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe substitute the given parameter values into the derived formula.\n-   $p_0 = 0.10$\n-   $p_1 = 0.15$\n-   $p_1 - p_0 = 0.05$\n-   $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$\n-   $\\beta = 0.20 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.80} \\approx 0.84162$\n-   $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_0 + p_1}{2} = \\frac{0.10 + 0.15}{2} = 0.125$\n\nFirst, we calculate the variance components:\n-   The variance term under $H_0$ is $V_0 = 2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2(0.125)(1-0.125) = 2(0.125)(0.875) = 0.21875$.\n-   The variance term under $H_a$ is $V_a = p_1(1-p_1) + p_0(1-p_0) = 0.15(1-0.15) + 0.10(1-0.10) = 0.15(0.85) + 0.10(0.90) = 0.1275 + 0.09 = 0.2175$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the sample size formula:\n$$ n = \\frac{\\left( 1.96 \\sqrt{0.21875} + 0.84162 \\sqrt{0.2175} \\right)^2}{(0.05)^2} $$\nCalculate the terms in the numerator:\n$$ \\sqrt{0.21875} \\approx 0.46770717 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{0.2175} \\approx 0.46636897 $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{\\left( 1.96 \\times 0.46770717 + 0.84162 \\times 0.46636897 \\right)^2}{0.0025} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{\\left( 0.91670605 + 0.39255845 \\right)^2}{0.0025} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{\\left( 1.3092645 \\right)^2}{0.0025} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{1.714175}{0.0025} $$\n$$ n \\approx 685.67 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures.\nThe calculated per-cohort sample size is $685.7$.",
