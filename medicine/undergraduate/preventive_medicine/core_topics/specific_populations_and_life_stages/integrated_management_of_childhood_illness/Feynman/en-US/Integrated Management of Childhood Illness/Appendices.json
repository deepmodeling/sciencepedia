            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following data and conditions are extracted verbatim from the problem statement:\n-   Child's weight: $m = 14\\,\\text{kg}$\n-   Diagnosis: non-severe pneumonia\n-   Medication: oral amoxicillin\n-   Recommended dose rate: $D_{rate} = 40\\,\\text{mg/kg}$ per dose\n-   Frequency of administration: $f = 2$ times per day\n-   Duration of treatment: $T = 5$ days\n-   Maximum daily limit for amoxicillin: $D_{max} = 2000\\,\\text{mg/day}$\n-   Required output: Total amount of amoxicillin for the $5$-day course, in $\\text{mg}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the criteria for validity:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard principles of pharmacology and pediatric medicine, specifically dosage calculation based on patient weight. The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is a recognized and established public health strategy. The drug, indication, and dosage values are within a realistic clinical range. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a complete set of data and constraints (weight, dose rate, frequency, duration, and a maximum daily limit) that allows for the calculation of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution. The instruction for rounding to four significant figures ensures a single final answer.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, precise, and unbiased language, free of any subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Conclusion**: No flaws are found. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total amount of amoxicillin to be dispensed is calculated by following a sequence of logical steps, starting from the single dose calculation and accounting for all given constraints.\n\n**1. Calculate the mass of amoxicillin per single dose ($A_{single}$):**\nThe prescribed dose rate is $D_{rate} = 40\\,\\text{mg/kg}$ per dose, and the child's mass is $m = 14\\,\\text{kg}$. The mass for a single dose is the product of these two quantities.\n$$A_{single} = D_{rate} \\times m$$\n$$A_{single} = \\left(40\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}\\right) \\times (14\\,\\text{kg}) = 560\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\n**2. Calculate the total mass of amoxicillin administered per day ($A_{daily, calc}$):**\nThe medication is administered twice daily, so the frequency is $f = 2$. The calculated daily amount is the single dose amount multiplied by the frequency.\n$$A_{daily, calc} = A_{single} \\times f$$\n$$A_{daily, calc} = (560\\,\\text{mg}) \\times 2 = 1120\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\n**3. Apply the maximum daily limit:**\nThe facility's safety protocol specifies a maximum daily limit of $D_{max} = 2000\\,\\text{mg/day}$. The calculated daily amount, $A_{daily, calc}$, must be compared to this limit.\n$$A_{daily, calc} = 1120\\,\\text{mg/day}$$\n$$D_{max} = 2000\\,\\text{mg/day}$$\nSince $1120\\,\\text{mg/day} < 2000\\,\\text{mg/day}$, the calculated daily dose does not exceed the maximum limit. Therefore, the actual daily dose to be administered, $A_{daily, actual}$, is the calculated dose.\n$$A_{daily, actual} = 1120\\,\\text{mg/day}$$\n\n**4. Calculate the total amount of amoxicillin for the entire course ($A_{total}$):**\nThe treatment duration is $T = 5$ days. The total amount of amoxicillin to be dispensed is the actual daily dose multiplied by the duration of the treatment.\n$$A_{total} = A_{daily, actual} \\times T$$\n$$A_{total} = (1120\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}) \\times (5\\,\\text{days}) = 5600\\,\\text{mg}$$\n\n**5. Express the final answer with a precision of four significant figures:**\nThe calculated total amount is an exact integer, $5600$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed to four significant figures. The number $5600$ as written is ambiguous and could be interpreted as having two, three, or four significant figures. To unambiguously convey a precision of four significant figures, we express the number in scientific notation.\n$$5600 = 5.600 \\times 10^3$$\nThis representation clearly indicates four significant figures ($5, 6, 0, 0$). The value itself does not need rounding as the calculation is exact. The final answer is $5.600 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{mg}$.",

This exercise guides you through applying IMCI Plan B for a child with \"some dehydration,\" a common and potentially serious condition.

Under IMCI Plan B for \"some dehydration,\" the widely accepted dosing principle is to administer Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) at $75\\,\\text{ml/kg}$ over a $4$-hour period.\n\nStarting from the IMCI weight-based dosing principle and the definition that the total replacement volume equals the dose per unit mass multiplied by body mass, derive the total ORS volume to be given over $4$ hours for this child. Then, using the same principle of time allocation, propose a practical monitoring and reassessment framework by evenly dividing the total volume across the $4$ hours and further into $15$-minute increments, stating the per-hour and per-$15$-minute amounts.\n\nRound your computed total ORS volume to four significant figures and express the final volume in milliliters ($\\text{ml}$). Your final answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, objective, and well-posed. It is based on established clinical guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF for the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI). All data required for the calculation are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total volume of Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) for a child with \"some dehydration\" and the subsequent determination of administration rates for a monitoring framework.\n\nFirst, we define the variables based on the givens:\n- The mass of the child, $m = 10\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- The prescribed dose of ORS per unit mass, $D = 75\\,\\text{ml/kg}$.\n- The total time period for administration, $T = 4\\,\\text{h}$.\n\nThe problem states the governing principle for the total replacement volume, $V$, is the dose per unit mass multiplied by the body mass. This can be expressed as the equation:\n$$V = D \\times m$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$V = 75\\,\\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 10\\,\\text{kg}$$\n$$V = 750\\,\\text{ml}$$\nThe problem explicitly requires that the final computed total volume be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $750\\,\\text{ml}$ has two significant figures as given by the input values. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $750.0\\,\\text{ml}$.\n\nNext, we derive the practical monitoring and reassessment framework by evenly dividing this total volume over the specified time period.\n\n1.  **Volume per hour:**\n    The total volume $V = 750.0\\,\\text{ml}$ is to be administered over a total time $T = 4\\,\\text{h}$. The rate of administration per hour, denoted as $R_{\\text{hour}}$, is:\n    $$R_{\\text{hour}} = \\frac{V}{T} = \\frac{750.0\\,\\text{ml}}{4\\,\\text{h}}$$\n    $$R_{\\text{hour}} = 187.5\\,\\text{ml/h}$$\n    Therefore, the child should receive $187.5\\,\\text{ml}$ of ORS each hour for $4$ hours.\n\n2.  **Volume per $15$-minute increment:**\n    A practical framework often involves smaller, more frequent administrations, especially for a young child. We are asked to determine the volume for $15$-minute increments. Since there are four $15$-minute intervals in one hour, the volume per $15$ minutes, denoted as $R_{15\\text{-min}}$, is one-fourth of the hourly rate:\n    $$R_{15\\text{-min}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{hour}}}{4} = \\frac{187.5\\,\\text{ml/h}}{4\\,\\text{intervals/h}}$$\n    $$R_{15\\text{-min}} = 46.875\\,\\text{ml per } 15\\,\\text{min}$$\n    This means the child would be given approximately $47\\,\\text{ml}$ of ORS every $15$ minutes. Continuous reassessment of the child's hydration status, thirst, and ability to drink is a critical component of IMCI Plan B and should accompany this administration schedule.\n\nIn summary, the total volume to be administered is $750.0\\,\\text{ml}$. The proposed framework involves administering $187.5\\,\\text{ml}$ each hour, which can be broken down into smaller amounts of $46.875\\,\\text{ml}$ every $15$ minutes. The final answer required is the total ORS volume rounded to four significant figures.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is derived by applying the provided fundamental definitions to the given clinical parameters. Let $V$ represent volume, $d$ dose per unit mass, $m$ mass, $t$ time, and $R$ infusion rate.\n\nThe problem specifies two distinct phases of intravenous fluid administration.\n\n**Phase 1: Initial Rapid Bolus**\nThe dose for the first phase is $d_1 = 30\\,\\text{ml/kg}$. The child's mass is $m = 12\\,\\text{kg}$. The volume for this phase, $V_1$, is calculated using the provided definition:\n$$V_1 = d_1 \\times m$$\n$$V_1 = (30\\,\\text{ml/kg}) \\times (12\\,\\text{kg}) = 360\\,\\text{ml}$$\nThe duration of this phase is given as $t_1 = 0.5\\,\\text{h}$.

A formal clinical reassessment must occur at the end of Phase 1, which is at time $t = t_1 = 0.5\\,\\text{h}$ from the start of the infusion.\n2. Ongoing monitoring is required throughout Phase 2, from $t = 0.5\\,\\text{h}$ to the end of the full course at $t = 3.0\\,\\text{h}$.\n\n**Time-Averaged Infusion Rate**\nTo compute the single time-averaged infusion rate, $R_{avg}$, over the entire Plan C course, we must first determine the total infused volume, $V_{total}$, and the total infusion time, $t_{total}$.\n\nThe total volume is the sum of the volumes from each phase:\n$$V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 = 360\\,\\text{ml} + 840\\,\\text{ml} = 1200\\,\\text{ml}$$\nAs a consistency check, the total dose is $30\\,\\text{ml/kg} + 70\\,\\text{ml/kg} = 100\\,\\text{ml/kg}$. The total volume is then $(100\\,\\text{ml/kg}) \\times (12\\,\\text{kg}) = 1200\\,\\text{ml}$, which confirms the calculation.\n\nThe total time is the sum of the durations of each phase:\n$$t_{total} = t_1 + t_2 = 0.5\\,\\text{h} + 2.5\\,\\text{h} = 3.0\\,\\text{h}$$\n\nThe time-averaged infusion rate is the total volume divided by the total time:\n$$R_{avg} = \\frac{V_{total}}{t_{total}}$$\n$$R_{avg} = \\frac{1200\\,\\text{ml}}{3.0\\,\\text{h}} = 400\\,\\text{ml/h}$$\nThis single rate represents the constant rate that would deliver the same total volume over the same total duration.",
