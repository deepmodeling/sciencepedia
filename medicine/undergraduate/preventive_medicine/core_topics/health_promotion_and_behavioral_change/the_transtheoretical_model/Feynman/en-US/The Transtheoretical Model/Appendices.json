            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides a clinical vignette and a question about the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change.\n\n**Vignette Data:**\n-   **Patient:** A $52$-year-old man with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n-   **First Visit Statement:** \"I know smoking is hurting me, and my wife is worried. Sometimes I think I should quit, but I still enjoy it and I am not sure I am ready.\" The patient also \"asks for information about options and listens attentively but does not commit to any plan.\"\n-   **Second Visit Statement:** \"I set a quit date for three weeks from now, bought nicotine patches, told my wife and brother, removed ashtrays from home, and I am practicing delaying my first cigarette of the day. I am still smoking, but I am getting ready.\"\n\n**Question:**\n-   The task is to identify the option that \"most accurately defines each stage of change and correctly identifies the observable behavioral markers that distinguish contemplation from preparation in smoking cessation,\" based on \"well-tested facts about the TTM.\"\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement must be evaluated for scientific soundness, objectivity, and whether it is well-posed.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is centered on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change, developed by Prochaska and DiClemente. The TTM is a foundational, empirically supported, and widely used model in health psychology, behavioral medicine, and public health for understanding and promoting behavior change. The stages of change (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, Maintenance, Termination) are well-defined constructs within this established scientific framework. The question's reference to \"well-tested facts\" directs the solver to these standard definitions. The clinical scenario is a realistic application of the model. The problem is therefore scientifically grounded.\n\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem presents a clinical scenario with direct quotes from a patient, which serve as objective data for staging. The question asks for the correct definitions from a theoretical model, which is an objective task based on established knowledge in the field. The language used is precise and free of subjective or biased claims.\n\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is self-contained. It provides a scenario and asks for the correct theoretical definitions that apply to it. The existence of a single, correct set of definitions for the TTM's core stages means that a unique solution can be determined by comparing the provided options against the established model. The question is unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded question that tests knowledge of the Transtheoretical Model of behavior change. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to identify the option that correctly defines the stages of the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and accurately distinguishes the Contemplation and Preparation stages. We will first review the canonical definitions of the TTM stages and then evaluate each option against this standard.\n\n**Canonical Definitions of the TTM Stages:**\n1.  **Precontemplation:** The individual has no intention to change their behavior in the foreseeable future (typically defined as the next $6$ months). They are often unaware that their behavior is problematic.\n2.  **Contemplation:** The individual is intending to change their behavior within the next $6$ months. They are aware of the pros of changing but are also acutely aware of the cons. This conflict results in ambivalence, which can cause them to remain in this stage for long periods.\n3.  **Preparation:** The individual intends to take action in the immediate future (typically defined as the next $30$ days or one month). They have typically taken some significant behavioral step in the past year. They have a plan of action.\n4.  **Action:** The individual has made specific, overt modifications in their lifestyle within the past $6$ months. For smoking, this stage is generally defined as total abstinence.\n5.  **Maintenance:** The individual has maintained the behavior change for more than $6$ months. They work to prevent relapse.\n6.  **Termination:** The individual has $100\\%$ self-efficacy, and there is zero temptation to return to the old behavior. This stage is not often reached.\n\n**Analysis of the Vignette:**\n-   **Visit 1:** The patient acknowledges the problem (\"I know smoking is hurting me\") but expresses significant ambivalence (\"but I still enjoy it and I am not sure I am ready\"). He is gathering information but has made no concrete plan or commitment to a quit date. This is the classic presentation of the **Contemplation** stage.\n-   **Visit 2:** The patient has a definitive plan to act in the near future (\"I set a quit date for three weeks from now,\" which is within $30$ days). He has taken multiple concrete steps: acquiring pharmacotherapy (\"bought nicotine patches\"), creating social support (\"told my wife and brother\"), modifying his environment (\"removed ashtrays\"), and rehearsing new behaviors (\"practicing delaying my first cigarette\"). This is the classic presentation of the **Preparation** stage. The distinguishing feature is the move from thinking and ambivalence to concrete planning and initial preparatory actions.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n-   **Definitions:**\n    -   Precontemplation: \"no intention to change within the next $6$ months\". **Correct.**\n    -   Contemplation: \"serious consideration of change within the next $6$ months with ambivalence but no concrete plan\". **Correct.**\n    -   Preparation: \"intends to act within the next $30$ days and has begun taking preparatory steps\". The examples provided (quit date, NRT, etc.) are all text-book correct. **Correct.**\n    -   Action: \"overt behavior change in the past $6$ months (for smoking, stopping smoking completely)\". **Correct.**\n    -   Maintenance: \"sustaining change for $ > 6$ months\". **Correct.**\n    -   Termination: \"no temptation and full self-efficacy...\". **Correct.**\n-   **Distinguishing Markers:** \"contemplation is characterized by expressed ambivalence and information-seeking without a time-bound plan or concrete steps; preparation is characterized by a time-bound quit plan and observable preparatory actions.\" This distinction is precise, accurate according to the TTM, and perfectly illustrated by the two visits in the vignette.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides a fully accurate and comprehensive summary of the TTM stages and their application to smoking cessation.\n\n**Option B:**\n-   **Definitions:**\n    -   Precontemplation: \"denies harm but plans to quit in the next $30$ days\". This is a direct contradiction. Denying harm is Precontemplation, while planning to quit in $30$ days is Preparation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Contemplation: \"cutting down cigarette consumption by $50\\%$\". This is a behavioral change, which is characteristic of Action or possibly Preparation, not the cognitive state of Contemplation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   The fundamental definitions are incorrect from the start.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n-   **Definitions:**\n    -   Contemplation: \"intends to change within the next $90$ days and has set a quit date\". Setting a quit date is a hallmark of the Preparation stage, not Contemplation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Preparation: \"intends to act within the next $6$ months but has not taken any steps\". This is the definition of Contemplation, not Preparation. The timeframe for Preparation is typically within $30$ days. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Action: \"any reduction in smoking\". Action in smoking cessation is defined as complete abstinence. Reduction is typically considered a preparatory strategy or a harm reduction outcome, not the endpoint of the Action stage itself. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Maintenance: \"$ > 3$ months of sustained change\". The standard definition is $ > 6$ months. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n-   **Definitions:** This option defines stages based on a \"readiness ruler\" score. While this tool can help assess a patient's stage, the stages are defined by cognitive and behavioral criteria (intent, plans, actions), not by a specific score on a subjective scale.\n    -   Preparation: \"scores $\\ge 7$ on a readiness ruler regardless of planning\". The key criterion for Preparation is planning and taking preparatory steps. High readiness without a plan is still Contemplation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Action: \"has obtained pharmacotherapy but is still smoking\". This is a classic preparatory behavior, as illustrated in the vignette. It is not the Action stage, which requires cessation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Maintenance: \"uses fewer cigarettes than baseline\". This would be considered \"harm reduction.\" Maintenance refers to sustaining complete abstinence. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The definitions are fundamentally flawed and misrepresent the core constructs of the TTM.\n\n**Option E:**\n-   **Definitions:**\n    -   Precontemplation: \"intends to change within the next $6$ months\". This is the definition of Contemplation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Contemplation: \"has chosen a quit date but continues to smoke\". Choosing a quit date is a key component of Preparation. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Preparation: \"stops smoking completely for $7$ days\". This describes the beginning of the Action stage. **Incorrect.**\n    -   Action: \"abstinent for $ > 6$ months\". This is the definition of Maintenance. **Incorrect.**\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option demonstrates a complete confusion of the TTM stages.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, Option A is the only one that provides scientifically accurate definitions for all stages of the Transtheoretical Model and correctly identifies the behavioral markers that distinguish the Contemplation and Preparation stages, as exemplified by the provided clinical case.",

            "problem": "A preventive medicine clinic intends to stage patients for alcohol use change using the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), but for operational simplicity can only collect two self-report variables at intake: (i) current continuous abstinence duration in days, denoted $d$, and (ii) longest quit attempt duration in the past $12$ months, denoted $\\tau$ (in days). Let $n$ be the count of past-year quit attempts, but note that only $d$ and $\\tau$ are available reliably. The clinic needs a decision rule that classifies a patient as being in preparation rather than action based solely on $d$ and $\\tau$.\n\nUse the following fundamental base, which you should treat as well-tested facts underlying the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) staging:\n\n- The preparation stage is characterized by imminent intention to change (typically within $30$ days) and evidence of taking small steps toward change. In behavioral measurement, a common operationalization of “small steps” is at least one prior quit attempt lasting $\\ge 24$ hours (i.e., $\\tau \\ge 1$ day) even if the patient is not currently abstinent.\n- The action stage is characterized by overt, criterion-level behavior change that is currently being performed and has been maintained for less than $6$ months. For abstinence as the target criterion, this means the individual is currently abstinent ($d > 0$) and $d < 6$ months. For operational simplicity, take $6$ months as $180$ days.\n\nDerive a decision rule grounded in these definitions that uses only $d$ and $\\tau$ to distinguish “preparation” from “action.” Which option below most closely adheres to the fundamental base while minimizing misclassification given the data constraints?\n\nA. Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$ day; classify as action if $d > 0$ and $d < 180$ days.\n\nB.

Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $n = 0$; classify as action if $d \\ge 1$ day and $d < 180$ days.",
            "solution": "The first step is to validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Variables:**\n    -   $d$: current continuous abstinence duration in days.\n    -   $\\tau$: longest quit attempt duration in the past $12$ months, in days.\n-   **Unavailable Variable:**\n    -   $n$: count of past-year quit attempts.\n-   **Constraint:** The decision rule must classify a patient as being in preparation rather than action based solely on $d$ and $\\tau$.\n-   **Fundamental Base (Definitions):**\n    1.  **Preparation Stage:**\n        -   Characterized by imminent intention to change (within $30$ days).\n        -   Evidence of taking small steps, operationalized as at least one prior quit attempt lasting $\\ge 24$ hours. This is equivalent to $\\tau \\ge 1$ day.\n        -   Implicitly, the patient is not yet meeting the Action stage criteria.\n    2.  **Action Stage:**\n        -   Characterized by overt, criterion-level behavior change (abstinence).\n        -   Currently being performed and has been maintained for less than $6$ months.\n        -   Operationalized as: currently abstinent ($d > 0$) and $d < 6$ months.\n        -   For operational simplicity, $6$ months is taken as $180$ days. So, $d > 0$ and $d < 180$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), a standard and well-established framework in behavioral science and preventive medicine. The operational definitions provided for the stages of change are common and logical simplifications used in clinical and research settings to make the theoretical constructs measurable.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The objective is to create a classification rule using a specified set of inputs ($d, \\tau$) and a clear set of definitions. The constraints are explicit (use only $d$ and $\\tau$). The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique, logical solution to be derived.\n-   **Objective:** The problem uses precise, unbiased language and provides its definitions as a \"fundamental base\" to be treated as fact for the purpose of the exercise, eliminating ambiguity and subjectivity. The problem structure is sound and does not contain contradictions, faulty premises, or fallacious reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Decision Rule\n\nThe task is to formulate a decision rule to distinguish the \"preparation\" stage from the \"action\" stage using only the variables $d$ (current abstinence duration) and $\\tau$ (longest past-year quit attempt duration).\n\n**Analysis of the Preparation Stage:**\nAccording to the provided definition, the preparation stage requires \"evidence of taking small steps toward change.\" This is explicitly operationalized as \"at least one prior quit attempt lasting $\\ge 24$ hours.\" Since $\\tau$ is the longest quit attempt duration in the past year, this condition is directly translated into the mathematical inequality $\\tau \\ge 1$ day.\n\nFurthermore, the preparation stage precedes the action stage. A patient in preparation is preparing to act but is not yet acting at the criterion level. The action stage is defined by current abstinence ($d > 0$). Therefore, a patient in the preparation stage must not be in the action stage, which implies they are not currently abstinent. If a patient is not currently abstinent, their duration of current *continuous* abstinence is $0$. Thus, $d = 0$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the rule to classify a patient into the **preparation** stage is:\n$$d = 0 \\text{ and } \\tau \\ge 1$$\n\n**Analysis of the Action Stage:**\nThe definition for the action stage is explicit: \"overt, criterion-level behavior change that is currently being performed and has been maintained for less than $6$ months.\"\n-   \"Currently being performed\" (i.e., currently abstinent) translates to a current continuous abstinence duration greater than zero: $d > 0$.\n-   \"Maintained for less than $6$ months\" is operationalized as $d < 180$ days.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the rule to classify a patient into the **action** stage is:\n$$d > 0 \\text{ and } d < 180$$\nThis can be written more compactly as $0 < d < 180$.\n\nThe derived decision rule is therefore:\n-   **Preparation:** $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$\n-   **Action:** $0 < d < 180$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derived rule.\n\n**A. Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$ day; classify as action if $d > 0$ and $d < 180$ days.**\n-   The preparation rule, $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$, exactly matches our derived rule. It correctly identifies individuals who are not currently abstinent but have demonstrated a preparatory behavior.\n-   The action rule, $d > 0$ and $d < 180$, also exactly matches our derived rule. It correctly identifies individuals who are currently abstinent within the specified time frame for the action stage.\n-   This option perfectly adheres to the fundamental base definitions and respects the data constraints.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Classify as preparation if $n \\ge 2$ and $\\tau \\ge 7$ days; classify as action if $d \\ge 30$ days and $d < 180$ days.**\n-   This option uses the variable $n$ (count of quit attempts), which the problem statement explicitly declares is \"not available reliably.\" A rule based on an unavailable variable is operationally invalid.\n-   Furthermore, its criteria ($\\tau \\ge 7$ and $d \\ge 30$) are more stringent than the fundamental base definitions ($\\tau \\ge 1$ and $d > 0$) and would lead to misclassification. For example, a patient with $d=15$ days is clearly in the action stage by definition but would be missed by this rule.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $\\tau < 1$ day; classify as action if $d \\ge 1$ day and $d < 180$ days.**\n-   The preparation rule, $d=0$ and $\\tau < 1$, contradicts the fundamental base, which requires evidence of a small step ($\\tau \\ge 1$). This rule would misclassify individuals in the contemplation stage (who have not yet taken a step) as being in preparation.\n-   The action rule, $d \\ge 1$ and $d < 180$, is equivalent to $d > 0$ and $d < 180$ for integer days, which is correct. However, the rule for preparation is fundamentally flawed.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$ day; classify as action if $d \\ge 7$ days and $d < 180$ days.**\n-   The preparation rule, $d = 0$ and $\\tau \\ge 1$, is correct.\n-   The action rule, $d \\ge 7$ and $d < 180$, is incorrect because it is overly restrictive. The fundamental definition of action begins as soon as the behavior change is initiated ($d>0$). This rule would fail to classify a patient who has been abstinent for $1$ to $6$ days as being in the action stage, despite them meeting the established criteria. Option A is superior as it does not have this flaw.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Classify as preparation if $d = 0$ and $n = 0$; classify as action if $d \\ge 1$ day and $d < 180$ days.**\n-   Like option B, this option illegitimately uses the unavailable variable $n$.\n-   Conceptually, the preparation rule $n=0$ is also wrong. Having zero quit attempts ($n=0$) implies a longest quit attempt of zero days ($\\tau=0$), which is the opposite of the \"taking small steps\" criterion for preparation.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that correctly formalizes the provided definitions using only the allowed variables, thus minimizing misclassification as requested.",

The population is distributed across the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) stages with the following proportions:\n- Precontemplation (PC): $0.35$\n- Contemplation (C): $0.30$\n- Preparation (P): $0.15$\n- Action (A): $0.10$\n- Maintenance (M): $0.10$\n\nFrom these proportions, we can calculate the number of individuals in each stage:\n- $N_{\\text{PC}} = 0.35 \\times 100{,}000 = 35{,}000$\n- $N_{\\text{C}} = 0.30 \\times 100{,}000 = 30{,}000$\n- $N_{\\text{P}} = 0.15 \\times 100{,}000 = 15{,}000$\n- $N_{\\text{A}} = 0.10 \\times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000$\n- $N_{\\text{M}} = 0.10 \\times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000$\n\nThe total number of available outreach contacts is $R = 60{,}000$.\n\nThe baseline screening uptake, without any outreach, is stated to be equal to the Action-stage proportion.\nBaseline uptake rate = $0.10$.\nThe number of baseline screenings is therefore $0.10 \\times N = 0.10 \\times 100{,}000 = 10{,}000$.\n\nThe target is a $0.10$ absolute increase in screening uptake.\nTarget uptake rate = Baseline rate + Increase = $0.10 + 0.10 = 0.20$.\nThe target number of total screenings is $0.20 \\times N = 0.20 \\times 100{,}000 = 20{,}000$.\n\nThe number of *additional* screenings that must be generated by the outreach program is the difference between the target and baseline screenings:\n$\\Delta_{\\text{target}} = 20{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 10{,}000$.\n\nThe expected number of additional screenings for an allocation of contacts $r = (r_{\\text{PC}}, r_{\\text{C}}, r_{\\text{P}}, r_{\\text{A}}, r_{\\text{M}})$ is given by $\\Delta(r) = \\sum_{i} a_{i} r_{i}$, where the yields $a_i$ are:\n$a_{\\text{PC}} = 0.04$\n$a_{\\text{C}} = 0.20$\n$a_{\\text{P}} = 0.35$\n$a_{\\text{A}} = 0.00$\n$a_{\\text{M}} = 0.00$\n\nThe initial allocation of contacts is $r^{0} = (r_{\\text{PC}}^{0}, r_{\\text{C}}^{0}, r_{\\text{P}}^{0}, r_{\\text{A}}^{0}, r_{\\text{M}}^{0})$, where:\n$r_{\\text{PC}}^{0} = 20{,}000$\n$r_{\\text{C}}^{0} = 25{,}000$\n$r_{\\text{P}}^{0} = 10{,}000$\n$r_{\\text{A}}^{0} = 3{,}000$\n$r_{\\text{M}}^{0} = 2{,}000$\n\nLet's calculate the number of additional screenings produced by this initial allocation, $\\Delta(r^{0})$:\n$\\Delta(r^{0}) = (0.04)(20{,}000) + (0.20)(25{,}000) + (0.35)(10{,}000) + (0.00)(3{,}000) + (0.00)(2{,}000)$\n$\\Delta(r^{0}) = 800 + 5{,}000 + 3{,}500 + 0 + 0 = 9{,}300$.\n\nThe initial allocation yields $9{,}300$ screenings, which is short of the required $10{,}000$. The shortfall is:\nShortfall = $\\Delta_{\\text{target}} - \\Delta(r^{0}) = 10{,}000 - 9{,}300 = 700$.\n\nWe need to find a new allocation $r$ that increases the yield by $700$ while minimizing the number of reallocated contacts. The number of reallocated contacts, let's call it $K$, is defined as half the $L^1$-distance between the new and initial allocations, $K = \\frac{1}{2} \\|r - r^{0}\\|_{1}$. Let $\\delta_i = r_i - r_i^0$ be the change in contact allocation for stage $i$. Then $K = \\sum_{\\delta_i > 0} \\delta_i$. We want to minimize $K$.\n\nThe change in the number of screenings is $\\Delta(r) - \\Delta(r^0) = \\sum a_i r_i - \\sum a_i r_i^0 = \\sum a_i (r_i - r_i^0) = \\sum a_i \\delta_i$.\nWe require $\\sum a_i \\delta_i = 700$.\nThe total number of contacts is fixed, so $\\sum r_i = \\sum r_i^0 = R$, which implies $\\sum \\delta_i = 0$.\n\nTo minimize the number of reallocated contacts $K$ needed to achieve the yield increase of $700$, we should reallocate contacts in the most efficient way possible. Efficiency is measured by the change in yield per reallocated contact. If we move one contact from stage $j$ to stage $k$ ($\\delta_k = +1, \\delta_j = -1$), the number of reallocations is $1$ and the change in yield is $a_k - a_j$. To maximize this change, we must choose stage $k$ to have the highest possible yield and stage $j$ to have the lowest possible yield.\n\nThe yields sorted in descending order are:\n$a_{\\text{P}} = 0.35$ (highest)\n$a_{\\text{C}} = 0.20$\n$a_{\\text{PC}} = 0.04$\n$a_{\\text{A}} = 0.00$ (lowest)\n$a_{\\text{M}} = 0.00$ (lowest)\n\nThe optimal strategy is to move contacts from the stages with the lowest yield (A and M) to the stage with the highest yield (P). The gain in yield for each contact moved from A or M to P is $a_{\\text{P}} - a_{\\text{A/M}} = 0.35 - 0.00 = 0.35$.\n\nLet $K$ be the total number of contacts reallocated this way. The total increase in yield will be $K \\times 0.35$. We need this increase to be $700$:\n$K \\times 0.35 = 700$\n$K = \\frac{700}{0.35} = \\frac{700}{35/100} = 20 \\times 100 = 2{,}000$.\n\nSo, the minimum number of reallocated contacts is $2{,}000$, provided this reallocation is feasible under the given constraints.\nThe constraints are $0 \\le r_i \\le N_i$ for all $i$.\nFor the new allocation $r_i = r_i^0 + \\delta_i$, this means $-r_i^0 \\le \\delta_i \\le N_i - r_i^0$.\n\n1.  **Feasibility of Destination:** We need to add $K=2,000$ contacts to stage P. So, $\\delta_{\\text{P}} = 2,000$. We must check if stage P has enough capacity for these additional contacts.\n    The maximum number of contacts that can be added to stage P is $N_{\\text{P}} - r_{\\text{P}}^{0} = 15{,}000 - 10{,}000 = 5{,}000$.\n    Since $2{,}000 \\le 5{,}000$, there is sufficient capacity in stage P.\n\n2.  **Feasibility of Source:** We need to remove $K=2,000$ contacts from stages A and/or M. So, $\\delta_{\\text{A}} + \\delta_{\\text{M}} = -2,000$ (with $\\delta_{\\text{A}}, \\delta_{\\text{M}} \\le 0$). We must check if there are enough contacts in these stages to be removed.\n    The total number of contacts available to be removed from stages A and M is $r_{\\text{A}}^{0} + r_{\\text{M}}^{0} = 3{,}000 + 2{,}000 = 5{,}000$.\n    Since $2{,}000 \\le 5{,}000$, there are sufficient contacts to source the reallocation. For example, we could take all $2,000$ from stage A (new $r_{\\text{A}} = 1,000 \\ge 0$) or all $2,000$ from stage M (new $r_{\\text{M}} = 0 \\ge 0$).\n\nThe proposed reallocation of $2,000$ contacts is feasible and achieves the target yield increase with optimal efficiency. Therefore, this is the minimal number of reallocations required.\n\nFinal allocation example:\n$r_{\\text{P}} = r_{\\text{P}}^0 + 2000 = 12,000$\n$r_{\\text{A}} = r_{\\text{A}}^0 - 2000 = 1,000$\n$r_{\\text{PC}}, r_{\\text{C}}, r_{\\text{M}}$ remain unchanged.\n$\\sum \\delta_i = +2000 - 2000 = 0$.\nThe total number of contacts moved is $2,000$.\n\nThe minimal number of contacts that must be reallocated is $2{,}000$.",
