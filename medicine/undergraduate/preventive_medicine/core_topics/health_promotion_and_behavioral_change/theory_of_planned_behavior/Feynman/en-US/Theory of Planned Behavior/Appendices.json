This first practice focuses on quantifying a person's 'Attitude' toward a behavior. You will apply the expectancy-value model to see how beliefs about specific outcomes ($b_i$) and the evaluations of those outcomes ($e_i$) are mathematically combined into a single attitudinal score ($A$), solidifying the foundational calculation used throughout the theory .",

            "problem": "A health psychology team is using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to quantify an individual’s attitude toward receiving a seasonal influenza vaccination. In the TPB’s expectancy-value (EV) framework, the overall evaluative attitude index is constructed from a set of salient behavioral beliefs and corresponding outcome evaluations. For a given individual, three salient outcomes have been elicited, and their belief strengths and outcome evaluations are summarized as vectors $b=[0.8,\\,0.3,\\,-0.6]$ and $e=[3,\\,1,\\,2]$, where each $e_i$ is measured on a bipolar semantic differential scale from $-3$ to $+3$ and each $b_i$ is a unitless belief strength that can be positive or negative to reflect facilitative or inhibitory expectation regarding the outcome.\n\nStarting from the following foundational principles of the EV approach, derive the general form of a valid unidimensional attitude index $A$ in terms of $b_i$ and $e_i$:\n1) Independence and additivity across outcomes: the total attitude equals the sum of contributions from each outcome.\n2) Linearity in belief strength: holding the evaluation fixed, doubling $b_i$ doubles that outcome’s contribution to the attitude.\n3) Linearity and polarity in evaluation: holding the belief strength fixed, the contribution varies linearly with $e_i$ and reverses sign if $e_i$ reverses sign.\n4) Null effects: if either $b_i=0$ or $e_i=0$, the contribution of that outcome is $0$.\n\nCalibrate the overall scale so that a single outcome with $b_i=1$ and $e_i=1$ increases $A$ by exactly $1$ unit. Then, using your derived expression, compute the attitude $A$ for the given $b$ and $e$. A previously validated decision rule classifies the attitude as “positive” if $A \\ge 1.5$; otherwise it is “not positive.” After computing $A$, briefly interpret its sign and its magnitude relative to the threshold $A=1.5$.\n\nReport the numerical value of $A$ rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) posits that attitude toward a behavior is determined by behavioral beliefs about consequences and evaluations of those consequences. In the expectancy-value (EV) framework, the overall attitude index is constructed by aggregating contributions from salient outcomes. We start from the foundational properties provided.\n\nLet the contribution of a single outcome with belief-evaluation pair $(b_i,e_i)$ be denoted by $\\phi(b_i,e_i)$. The total attitude is then\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\phi(b_i,e_i).\n$$\nThe assumptions impose the following structure on $\\phi$:\n- Additivity across outcomes yields summation across $i$.\n- Linearity in belief strength: for any scalar $c$, $\\phi(c\\,b_i,e_i)=c\\,\\phi(b_i,e_i)$.\n- Linearity and polarity in evaluation: for any scalars $e_{1},e_{2}$, $\\phi(b_i,e_{1}+e_{2})=\\phi(b_i,e_{1})+\\phi(b_i,e_{2})$ and $\\phi(b_i,-e_i)=-\\phi(b_i,e_i)$.\n- Null effects: $\\phi(0,e_i)=0$ and $\\phi(b_i,0)=0$.\n\nThe linearity in each argument together with bilinearity requirements implies that $\\phi$ must be a bilinear mapping of the form\n$$\n\\phi(b_i,e_i) \\;=\\; k\\,b_i\\,e_i,\n$$\nfor some constant $k$ that sets the overall scale of $A$. This follows because $\\phi$ is linear in $b_i$ (homogeneous of degree $1$ and additive) and linear in $e_i$, and the only scalar-valued bilinear form on $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ is proportional to the product $b_i e_i$.\n\nTo set $k$, we use the calibration: a single outcome with $b_i=1$ and $e_i=1$ increases $A$ by $1$ unit.

            "problem": "A multidisciplinary clinic is evaluating how social pressure influences patients’ intention to undergo a preventive screening behavior. Within the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the construct of the subjective norm (SN) reflects perceived injunctive social expectations weighted by the individual’s motivation to comply with those expectations.\n\nAssume three salient referents: the primary care clinician, the spouse, and the peer group. For a particular patient, standardized measurement yields the following injunctive normative beliefs vector and motivation-to-comply vector:\n$$\\mathbf{n} = [0.5,\\,-0.2,\\,0.9], \\quad \\mathbf{m} = [2,\\,3,\\,1].$$\nHere, each entry $n_{i}$ represents the patient’s belief that referent $i$ thinks the patient should undergo screening, scored on a scale from $-1$ (strong perceived opposition to screening) to $+1$ (strong perceived support for screening), and each $m_{i}$ is the patient’s motivation to comply with referent $i$ on a $0$ to $3$ scale, where larger values indicate stronger motivation.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of the Theory of Planned Behavior and the general expectancy-value integration principle for normative components, derive from first principles how to aggregate the referent-specific measurements into a single composite subjective norm $SN$. Then compute the numeric value of $SN$ for the patient using the data above. Finally, on the basis of a zero-neutral point, determine whether the net social pressure toward screening is supportive or discouraging. Express the computed $SN$ as an exact decimal number with no rounding. No units are required for $SN$.",
            "solution": "The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) posits that intention to perform a behavior is jointly determined by attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm (SN), and perceived behavioral control. The subjective norm is conceptually defined as the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform the behavior. In measurement practice for injunctive norms, each salient referent contributes two elements: the perceived injunctive expectation (normative belief) and the individual’s motivation to comply with that referent.\n\nA fundamental base from social-cognitive measurement is the expectancy-value integration principle: when multiple cues contribute to a composite construct, each cue’s effect is the product of its strength (expectancy/belief) and its value/importance (weight), and the total construct is the sum over cues. Applied to injunctive norms in TPB, the strength term is the injunctive normative belief for referent $i$, denoted $n_{i}$, and the value/weight term is the motivation to comply with referent $i$, denoted $m_{i}$. Therefore, starting from these foundational principles, the composite subjective norm is the additive aggregation across $k$ salient referents:\n$$SN = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_{i}\\, m_{i}.$$\nThis expression follows directly from the expectancy-value framework: each referent’s contribution is scaled by the motivation to comply, and contributions are additive because multiple referents jointly exert social influence. The zero-neutral point arises because $n_{i}$ is centered at $0$ (no perceived push), with negative values indicating perceived opposition and positive values indicating perceived support. With $m_{i} \\geq 0$, the sign of each product $n_{i} m_{i}$ carries the referent’s directional influence, and the sum’s sign reflects the net direction.\n\nWe now compute $SN$ from the provided vectors. There are three referents ($k=3$), with\n$$\\mathbf{n} = [n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}] = [0.5,\\,-0.2,\\,0.9], \\quad \\mathbf{m} = [m_{1}, m_{2}, m_{3}] = [2,\\,3,\\,1].$$\nCompute each product:\n- For referent $1$: $$n_{1} m_{1} = 0.5 \\times 2 = 1.0.$$\n- For referent $2$: $$n_{2} m_{2} = (-0.2) \\times 3 = -0.6.$$\n- For referent $3$: $$n_{3} m_{3} = 0.9 \\times 1 = 0.9.$$\nSum these contributions:\n$$SN = 1.0 + (-0.6) + 0.9 = 1.3.$$\n\nInterpretation at the zero-neutral point: since $SN = 1.3 > 0$, the net social pressure is supportive of undergoing the screening behavior. If the sum had been negative, it would indicate net discouragement; if exactly zero, it would indicate neutrality.\n\nTherefore, the computed subjective norm is $SN = 1.3$, which corresponds to net supportive social pressure toward screening on the given measurement scales.",

This final practice brings the core constructs—Attitude ($A$), Subjective Norm ($SN$), and Perceived Behavioral Control ($PBC$)—together into a predictive model.

            "problem": "A hospital-based medical psychology team is applying the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to predict a patient's intention to adhere to a newly prescribed antihypertensive regimen. In the TPB, the intention construct is determined by three standardized psychological components: Attitude toward the behavior ($A$), Subjective Norm ($SN$), and Perceived Behavioral Control ($PBC$). The team has pre-specified policy weights reflecting the relative contribution of each component to intention, denoted by $w_{a}$ for Attitude, $w_{s}$ for Subjective Norm, and $w_{p}$ for Perceived Behavioral Control. All three component scores are standardized (zero-mean, unit-variance) $z$-scores so they are commensurate, and all weights are nonnegative real numbers.\n\nAssume the following foundational measurement-theoretic properties for the intention index aggregator used by the team:\n- Additive separability of component effects: holding two components fixed, changing one component changes intention independently of the others.\n- Positive homogeneity of degree one in the components: scaling all components by a positive constant $k$ scales intention by the same factor $k$.\n- Null contribution at zero: a component equal to zero contributes zero to intention.\n- Monotonicity in each component given nonnegative weights: increasing any of $A$, $SN$, or $PBC$ (with its weight held fixed and nonnegative) does not decrease intention.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the core TPB idea that intention is determined by the three components and their weights, derive the expression for the latent intention index $I$ and then compute its value for the following patient profile: $A = 1.2$, $SN = 0.8$, $PBC = 1.5$, with policy weights $w_{a} = 0.4$, $w_{s} = 0.3$, and $w_{p} = 0.5$.\n\nFor clinical decision-making, the hospital uses a discrete intention category $C$ on a $0$ to $3$ scale, where the observed category is the nearest integer to the latent index, clipped to the bounds. That is,\n$$\nC \\;=\\; \\min\\left\\{3, \\max\\left\\{0, \\operatorname{round}\\!\\left(I\\right)\\right\\}\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{round}(\\cdot)$ denotes rounding to the nearest integer using midpoint thresholds at $n + 0.5$ for integers $n$.\n\nCompute $I$, determine $C$, and report only $C$ as your final answer. No units are required. The final answer must be a single integer in the range $0$ to $3$.",
            "solution": "The first step is to derive the functional form for the latent intention index $I$ based on the provided measurement-theoretic properties. Let $I$ be a function of the three components $A$, $SN$, and $PBC$. The weights $w_{a}$, $w_{s}$, and $w_{p}$ are parameters of this function.\n$$I = f(A, SN, PBC)$$\n\n1.  **Additive separability**: This property implies that the function $f$ can be written as a sum of functions of each individual component.\n    $$I = f_A(A) + f_{SN}(SN) + f_{PBC}(PBC)$$\n\n2.  **Positive homogeneity of degree one**: For any positive constant $k > 0$, the function must satisfy:\n    $$f(kA, kSN, kPBC) = k \\cdot f(A, SN, PBC)$$\n    Substituting the separable form from the first property:\n    $$f_A(kA) + f_{SN}(kSN) + f_{PBC}(kPBC) = k \\cdot [f_A(A) + f_{SN}(SN) + f_{PBC}(PBC)]$$\n    This equation must hold for all values of $A$, $SN$, and $PBC$. This implies that each individual function must also be positive homogeneous of degree one. For example, by setting $SN=0$ and $PBC=0$, we get $f_A(kA) = k \\cdot f_A(A)$. A function satisfying this property is a linear function passing through the origin. Therefore, each component function must be of the form:\n    $$f_A(A) = c_A \\cdot A$$\n    $$f_{SN}(SN) = c_{SN} \\cdot SN$$\n    $$f_{PBC}(PBC) = c_{PBC} \\cdot PBC$$\n    where $c_A$, $c_{SN}$, and $c_{PBC}$ are constants of proportionality.\n\n3.  **Role of Weights**: The problem states that intention is determined by the components and their weights. It is logical to identify the constants of proportionality with the respective policy weights.\n    $$c_A = w_{a}, \\quad c_{SN} = w_{s}, \\quad c_{PBC} = w_{p}$$\n    This establishes the functional form as a weighted linear combination:\n    $$I = w_{a}A + w_{s}SN + w_{p}PBC$$\n\n4.  **Verification with remaining properties**:\n    - **Null contribution at zero**: If any component, say $A$, is zero, its contribution to the index is $w_{a} \\cdot 0 = 0$. This holds.\n    - **Monotonicity**: The partial derivative of $I$ with respect to any component, for example $A$, is $\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial A} = w_{a}$. Since the problem states that weights are non-negative ($w_{a}, w_{s}, w_{p} \\ge 0$), an increase in any component will not result in a decrease in $I$. This holds.\n\nThe derived expression for the latent intention index is therefore $I = w_{a}A + w_{s}SN + w_{p}PBC$.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $I$ for the given patient profile.\nThe given values are:\n- $A = 1.2$\n- $SN = 0.8$\n- $PBC = 1.5$\n- $w_{a} = 0.4$\n- $w_{s} = 0.3$\n- $w_{p} = 0.5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $I$:\n$$I = (0.4)(1.2) + (0.3)(0.8) + (0.5)(1.5)$$\n$$I = 0.48 + 0.24 + 0.75$$\n$$I = 0.72 + 0.75$$\n$$I = 1.47$$\n\nFinally, we determine the clinical intention category, $C$. The formula is:\n$$C = \\min\\left\\{3, \\max\\left\\{0, \\operatorname{round}(I)\\right\\}\\right\\}$$\nWith $I = 1.47$, we first compute the rounded value. Since $1.47$ is less than the midpoint $1.5$, it is rounded down to the nearest integer.\n$$\\operatorname{round}(1.47) = 1$$\nNext, we apply the $\\max$ and $\\min$ functions:\n$$C = \\min\\left\\{3, \\max\\left\\{0, 1\\right\\}\\right\\}$$\nThe inner part is:\n$$\\max\\left\\{0, 1\\right\\} = 1$$\nThe outer part is:\n$$C = \\min\\left\\{3, 1\\right\\} = 1$$\n\nThe resulting clinical intention category $C$ is $1$.",
