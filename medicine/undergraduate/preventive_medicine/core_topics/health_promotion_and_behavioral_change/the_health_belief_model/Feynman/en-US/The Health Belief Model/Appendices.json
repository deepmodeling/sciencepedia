This practice problem operationalizes the model's core constructs into a quantitative, rational-choice scenario, illustrating the fundamental trade-off an individual faces .

            "problem": "An advanced-undergraduate preventive medicine student is modeling preventive action using the Health Belief Model (HBM). The constructs are operationalized as follows: perceived susceptibility is a probability $p_{s} \\in [0,1]$, perceived severity is a loss magnitude $d > 0$ measured in a standardized burden scale, perceived benefit $b \\in [0,1]$ is the proportional efficacy of the action in reducing the expected disease burden, and perceived barriers $c \\ge 0$ is the subjective cost of acting measured in the same burden units as the expected disease burden. Assume the following decision-theoretic foundation consistent with HBM: the expected disease burden without action is $p_{s} d$, action reduces this burden proportionally by the efficacy $b$ so that the remaining burden with action is $(1-b) p_{s} d$, and the barrier cost $c$ is incurred only if action is taken. Under rational choice, action is taken if and only if the net expected change in burden due to action minus the barrier cost is positive.\n\nGiven $p_{s} = 0.2$, $d = 5$, $b = 0.6$, and $c = 0.4$ (all scaled to comparable units), determine whether action is predicted and compute the minimal benefit $b_{\\min}$ required for action to be predicted under the stated model.

The model is based on rational choice theory, where an agent acts to maximize expected utility (or, equivalently, minimize expected disutility/burden).\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The HBM is a well-established model, and its formalization using decision theory is a valid and common approach in health economics and behavioral modeling. The premises are sound within this theoretical context.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All variables, constants, and the decision rule are explicitly defined. The questions asked have unique, derivable answers based on the provided framework.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\nThe problem is internally consistent, complete, and formalizable. No flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe model posits a rational agent who decides whether to take a preventive action based on a cost-benefit analysis of expected outcomes. Let $E_{0}$ be the expected burden without action and $E_{1}$ be the expected burden with action.\n\nThe expected burden without action is given as the product of perceived susceptibility and severity:\n$$E_{0} = p_{s} d$$\n\nIf action is taken, the disease burden is reduced by a proportion $b$, but a cost $c$ is incurred. The total expected burden with action is the sum of the remaining disease burden and the barrier cost:\n$$E_{1} = (1-b) p_{s} d + c$$\n\nThe problem states that \"action is taken if and only if the net expected change in burden due to action minus the barrier cost is positive.\" Let's formalize this.\nThe \"change in burden due to action\" refers to the reduction in the disease-related burden, which is the initial burden minus the remaining burden:\n$$\\text{Reduction in disease burden} = (p_{s} d) - (1-b) p_{s} d = p_{s} d - p_{s} d + b p_{s} d = b p_{s} d$$\nThe decision rule states that action is taken if this reduction exceeds the barrier cost $c$:\n$b p_{s} d - c > 0$\nwhich simplifies to the core decision inequality:\n$b p_{s} d > c$\nThis is consistent with the rational choice criterion that action should be taken if the expected burden with action is less than the expected burden without it, i.e., $E_{1}  E_{0}$:\n$(1-b) p_{s} d + c  p_{s} d$\n$p_{s} d - b p_{s} d + c  p_{s} d$\n$-b p_{s} d + c  0$\n$c  b p_{s} d$\nThis confirms the decision inequality is correct.\n\nThere are two tasks:\n1.  Determine the action indicator $I$ for the given values.\n2.  Compute the minimal benefit $b_{\\min}$ required for action.\n\n**1. Determine the Action Indicator $I$**\nWe are given $p_{s} = 0.2$, $d = 5$, $b = 0.6$, and $c = 0.4$. We test the decision inequality $b p_{s} d > c$.\n\nFirst, calculate the product $b p_{s} d$:\n$$b p_{s} d = (0.6)(0.2)(5) = (0.6)(1) = 0.6$$\nNow, compare this value to the cost $c$:\n$$c = 0.4$$\nThe inequality is $0.6 > 0.4$, which is true.\nSince the condition is met, action is predicted. By definition, the action indicator $I$ is 1.\n$$I = 1$$\n\n**2. Compute the Minimal Benefit $b_{\\min}$**\nThe minimal benefit required for action, denoted $b_{\\min}$, is the threshold value of $b$ at which a rational agent becomes willing to act. This corresponds to the boundary condition of our decision inequality, $b p_{s} d > c$. To find this threshold, we solve for $b$:\n$$b > \\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$$\nAction is taken for any benefit $b$ strictly greater than the ratio $\\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$. The minimal value of $b$ that satisfies this condition is the infimum of the set of possible values for $b$, which is the threshold itself. Thus, we define $b_{\\min}$ as:\n$$b_{\\min} = \\frac{c}{p_{s} d}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values for $c$, $p_{s}$, and $d$:\n$$b_{\\min} = \\frac{0.4}{(0.2)(5)} = \\frac{0.4}{1.0} = 0.4$$\nThis value must be within the permissible range for benefit, $b \\in [0,1]$. Since $0 \\le 0.4 \\le 1$, this is a valid threshold for the benefit. For any benefit $b > 0.4$, action is predicted, while for $b \\le 0.4$, it is not.\n$$b_{\\min} = 0.4$$\n\nThe required outputs are $I = 1$ and $b_{\\min} = 0.4$. These are to be presented as a row matrix.",

            "introduction": "The \"perceived threat\" is a key driver of action in the HBM, but it is a composite of two distinct beliefs: perceived susceptibility and perceived severity.

            "problem": "A public health team is using the Health Belief Model (HBM) to anticipate uptake of a new screening test. In this operationalization, perceived threat is modeled as the product of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Let perceived threat be defined by the modeling assumption $T = p_{s} \\cdot d$, where $p_{s}$ represents perceived susceptibility and $d$ represents perceived severity, each scaled on a dimensionless, nonnegative interval. Suppose the baseline perceived susceptibility and perceived severity are $p_{s0}$ and $d_{0}$, respectively, giving baseline threat $T_{0} = p_{s0} \\cdot d_{0}$. A media campaign is observed to double perceived susceptibility and concurrently reduce perceived severity by $25\\%$ (for example, increased awareness raises perceived susceptibility while messaging about improved treatments reduces perceived severity). Under these changes, compute the multiplicative change factor $R = \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}$, where $T_{1}$ is the new perceived threat after the changes. Provide your final answer as an exact value. Then, briefly explain, based on the Health Belief Model, how this change in $T$ would be expected to influence the likelihood of preventive action if other constructs (perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action) are held constant.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of a multiplicative change factor for perceived threat based on a specified model and a subsequent explanation based on the Health Belief Model (HBM).\n\nThe problem defines the perceived threat, $T$, as the product of perceived susceptibility, $p_s$, and perceived severity, $d$. The modeling assumption is given as:\n$T = p_s \\cdot d$\nBoth $p_s$ and $d$ are defined on a dimensionless, nonnegative interval.\n\nThe baseline state is characterized by a perceived susceptibility $p_{s0}$ and a perceived severity $d_{0}$. The baseline perceived threat, $T_{0}$, is therefore:\n$$T_{0} = p_{s0} \\cdot d_{0}$$\nA media campaign induces changes in these perceptions. The new perceived susceptibility, $p_{s1}$, is stated to be double the baseline value:\n$$p_{s1} = 2 \\cdot p_{s0}$$\nConcurrently, the new perceived severity, $d_{1}$, is reduced by $25\\%$ from its baseline value. A reduction of $25\\%$ means the new value is $100\\% - 25\\% = 75\\%$ of the original value. This can be expressed as:\n$$d_{1} = (1 - 0.25) \\cdot d_0 = 0.75 \\cdot d_0$$\nFor exactness in calculation, we express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$d_{1} = \\frac{3}{4} d_0$$\nThe new perceived threat, $T_{1}$, is the product of these new values, consistent with the model:\n$$T_{1} = p_{s1} \\cdot d_{1}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_{s1}$ and $d_{1}$ in terms of the baseline values:\n$$T_{1} = (2 \\cdot p_{s0}) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{3}{4} d_0\\right)$$\nBy rearranging the terms, we can express $T_{1}$ in relation to the baseline threat $T_{0}$:\n$$T_{1} = \\left(2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}\\right) \\cdot (p_{s0} \\cdot d_0)$$\n$$T_{1} = \\frac{6}{4} \\cdot T_{0}$$\n$$T_{1} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot T_{0}$$\nThe problem requires the computation of the multiplicative change factor $R = \\frac{T_{1}}{T_{0}}$. Using the relationship derived above:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2} \\cdot T_{0}}{T_{0}}$$\nAssuming $T_{0} \\neq 0$ (which is implicit, as we are discussing changes from a baseline), we can cancel $T_{0}$:\n$$R = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThis value can also be expressed as $1.5$. This means the new perceived threat is $1.5$ times the baseline threat, which corresponds to a $50\\%$ increase.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for an explanation of how this change in $T$ would be expected to influence the likelihood of preventive action, assuming other constructs of the HBM are held constant. The Health Belief Model posits that an individual's readiness to take action is influenced by several core constructs. The perceived threat of a health condition is a central component. It is composed of perceived susceptibility (one's subjective assessment of the risk of developing the condition) and perceived severity (one's subjective assessment of the seriousness of the condition and its consequences). The calculation shows that $T_1 > T_0$. This increase in overall perceived threat, with all other factors (perceived benefits of action, perceived barriers to action, self-efficacy, and cues to action) held constant, serves as a stronger motivation for behavior change. Therefore, according to the HBM, the increase in perceived threat from $T_0$ to $T_1$ would increase the likelihood that an individual will undertake the preventive action, which in this case is the new screening test. The opposing effects of the campaign on susceptibility and severity (one increasing, one decreasing) did not cancel out; instead, they resulted in a net increase in the perceived threat, thereby increasing the impetus for action.",

            "problem": "An advanced undergraduate preventive medicine study operationalizes constructs from the Health Belief Model (HBM) by modeling the probability of completing a recommended screening within the next six months as a binary outcome. Perceived benefits are measured on a $7$-point scale, and other constructs (perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and cues to action) are also recorded. A widely used and well-tested approach for such binary outcomes is to use a model where the log-odds of the outcome is a linear function of predictors. In this cohort, the estimated slope for perceived benefits is $\\beta_{\\text{ben}}=0.25$ per one-point increase, with all other covariates held constant. Consider an individual whose baseline predicted screening probability is $0.4$ at their current perceived benefits level. Now suppose this individual experiences a $3$-point increase in perceived benefits (e.g., moving from $3$ to $6$ on the scale), with all other constructs unchanged.\n\nStarting from the standard definitions of odds, log-odds, and the logistic link for binary outcomes, derive the multiplicative change in odds attributable to this $3$-point increase and compute the corresponding change in predicted probability from the $0.4$ baseline. Express the odds ratio as a unitless number and the predicted probability change as a decimal. Round both quantities to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard application of logistic regression, a cornerstone of statistical modeling for binary outcomes in fields such as epidemiology and preventive medicine. All necessary parameters for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions that link probability, odds, and the logistic model. Let $p$ be the probability of the binary outcome (completing the screening). The odds of the outcome, $O$, are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring:\n$$\nO = \\frac{p}{1-p}\n$$\nThe logistic regression model, as described in the problem statement, posits a linear relationship between the natural logarithm of the odds (the log-odds or logit) and a set of predictor variables $X_k$. The general form of the model is:\n$$\n\\ln(O) = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\beta_k X_k\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\\beta_k$ are the regression coefficients for the $N$ predictors.\n\nIn this specific problem, we are interested in the effect of a change in one predictor, perceived benefits, which we will denote as $X_{\\text{ben}}$. The model can be written to isolate this predictor:\n$$\n\\ln(O) = \\beta_{\\text{ben}} X_{\\text{ben}} + C\n$$\nwhere $C = \\beta_0 + \\sum_{k \\neq \\text{ben}} \\beta_k X_k$ represents the combined contribution of the intercept and all other covariates, which are held constant.\n\nLet the initial state of the individual be denoted by subscript $0$. The log-odds at this baseline are:\n$$\n\\ln(O_0) = \\beta_{\\text{ben}} X_{\\text{ben},0} + C\n$$\nThe individual then experiences a $3$-point increase in perceived benefits.

The relationship $p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$ is derived from the definition of odds. Applying this to $O_1$:\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{O_1}{1+O_1} = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}\\exp(0.75)}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}\\exp(0.75)}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\exp(0.75)$:\n$$\np_1 \\approx \\frac{\\frac{2}{3} \\times 2.11700}{1 + \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2.11700} \\approx \\frac{1.411333}{1 + 1.411333} = \\frac{1.411333}{2.411333} \\approx 0.5852504 \\dots\n$$\nThe problem asks for the change in predicted probability, $\\Delta p$, which is the difference between the new probability and the baseline probability:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p_1 - p_0 \\approx 0.5852504 - 0.4 = 0.1852504 \\dots\n$$\nRounding this change to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\Delta p \\approx 0.1853\n$$\nThus, the multiplicative change in odds is approximately $2.117$, and the corresponding change in predicted probability is approximately $0.1853$.",
