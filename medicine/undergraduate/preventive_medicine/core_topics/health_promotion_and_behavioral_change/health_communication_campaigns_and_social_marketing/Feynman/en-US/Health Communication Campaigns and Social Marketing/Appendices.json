            "introduction": "Effective health communication hinges on finding the right message. Modern campaigns frequently use A/B testing to compare different message variants, but a common pitfall is testing with too few participants. This exercise tackles a foundational step in rigorous campaign design: calculating the minimum sample size needed to confidently determine if one message is truly more effective than another. Mastering this skill is crucial for planning studies that are both resource-efficient and statistically powerful enough to yield meaningful results .",

            "problem": "A municipal public health department plans a social marketing campaign to increase uptake of free influenza vaccination appointments among adults who use its mobile health application. Two message variants will be tested in an A/B test (split test): Variant A is a standard informational message; Variant B is a social norms message that emphasizes how many peers have already scheduled appointments. The primary outcome is engagement, defined as whether a user clicks the “Schedule Now” button within $72$ hours of first viewing the assigned message. Each message exposure to a unique user constitutes one independent Bernoulli trial with probability of success equal to the engagement rate for that message.\n\nFrom past campaigns, the department estimates the engagement rate for a standard informational message to be $p_{A} = 0.06$. Based on formative pretesting, they judge it meaningful to detect an absolute increase to $p_{B} = 0.08$ for the social norms message. They will randomize exposures $1:1$ between the two message variants and analyze the difference in engagement rates using a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, targeting power $1 - \\beta = 0.80$ under the alternative $p_{A} = 0.06$ and $p_{B} = 0.08$.\n\nAssuming independent trials, large-sample normal approximations for sample proportions, and equal allocation between arms, derive from first principles the minimum equal sample size per arm, $n$, required to detect the specified absolute difference in engagement rates with the stated $\\alpha$ and power using a two-sided test. Report the value of $n$ as the smallest integer that achieves at least the desired power under these assumptions. The final answer must be a single number (the required exposures per arm). No additional units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum sample size per arm, $n$, for a two-sample test of proportions, given a significance level $\\alpha$, power $1-\\beta$, and specific proportions under the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nFirst, we establish the statistical framework. Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the true engagement rates for message variants A and B, respectively. We are testing the null hypothesis $H_0$ against a two-sided alternative hypothesis $H_A$:\n$$ H_0: p_A = p_B $$\n$$ H_A: p_A \\neq p_B $$\nThe sample sizes for the two arms are equal, $n_A = n_B = n$. Let $\\hat{p}_A$ and $\\hat{p}_B$ be the observed sample proportions of engagement in each arm. The test is based on the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_B - \\hat{p}_A$.\n\nUnder the large-sample normal approximation, the general formula for the sample size per arm, $n$, for a two-sided test is:\n$$ n = \\left( \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_\\beta \\sqrt{p_A(1-p_A) + p_B(1-p_B)}}{p_B - p_A} \\right)^2 $$\nwhere:\n- $z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the significance level $\\alpha$.\n- $z_\\beta$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution for the desired power $1-\\beta$.\n- $p_A$ and $p_B$ are the proportions under the alternative hypothesis.\n- $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_A + p_B}{2}$ is the average proportion.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values from the problem:\n-   $p_A = 0.06$\n-   $p_B = 0.08$\n-   $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$\n-   $1-\\beta = 0.80 \\implies \\beta = 0.20 \\implies z_\\beta = z_{0.20} \\approx 0.8416$\n\nWe calculate the components of the formula:\n-   The difference in proportions: $p_B - p_A = 0.08 - 0.06 = 0.02$.\n-   The average proportion: $\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.06 + 0.08}{2} = 0.07$.\n-   The variance term related to $H_0$: $2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) = 2(0.07)(1-0.07) = 2(0.07)(0.93) = 0.1302$.\n-   The variance term related to $H_A$: $p_A(1-p_A) + p_B(1-p_B) = 0.06(1-0.06) + 0.08(1-0.08) = 0.06(0.94) + 0.08(0.92) = 0.0564 + 0.0736 = 0.13$.\n\nPlugging these into the formula:\n$$ n = \\left( \\frac{1.96 \\sqrt{0.1302} + 0.8416 \\sqrt{0.13}}{0.02} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ n \\approx \\left( \\frac{1.96(0.36083) + 0.8416(0.36056)}{0.02} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ n \\approx \\left( \\frac{0.70723 + 0.30346}{0.02} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ n \\approx \\left( \\frac{1.01069}{0.02} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ n \\approx (50.5345)^2 \\approx 2553.736 $$\n\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer and must be large enough to achieve at least the desired power of $0.80$, we must round the calculated value up to the next whole number.\n$$ n = \\lceil 2553.736 \\rceil = 2554 $$\nTherefore, the minimum required sample size per arm is $2554$.",
