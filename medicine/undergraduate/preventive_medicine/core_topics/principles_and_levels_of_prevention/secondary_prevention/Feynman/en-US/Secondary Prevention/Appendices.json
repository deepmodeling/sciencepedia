We will proceed by first defining the relevant events and parameters, then deriving the symbolic expressions, computing the numerical values, and finally interpreting the results.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has colorectal cancer, and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe given information can be expressed in terms of probabilities:\n- The prevalence of the disease, $\\pi$, is the prior probability of having the disease: $P(D) = \\pi = 0.02$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n- The sensitivity, $Se$, is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present: $P(T^+ | D) = Se = 0.90$.\n- The specificity, $Sp$, is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent: $P(T^- | D^c) = Sp = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the false negative rate and the false positive rate:\n- False negative rate: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n- False positive rate: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Symbolic Expressions**\n\nWe are asked to derive expressions for the positive predictive value ($\\mathrm{PPV}$), negative predictive value ($\\mathrm{NPV}$), and the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^{+}$).\n\n**Positive Predictive Value ($\\mathrm{PPV}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D | T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. By the law of total probability, we can express it as:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the symbolic parameters:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)\n$$\nTherefore, the symbolic expression for $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}\n$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value ($\\mathrm{NPV}$)**\nThe $\\mathrm{NPV}$ is the probability that an individual does not have the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the overall probability of a negative test. By the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting the symbolic parameters:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (Sp)(1 - \\pi) + (1 - Se)(\\pi)\n$$\nTherefore, the symbolic expression for $\\mathrm{NPV}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - \\pi) + (1 - Se) \\cdot \\pi}\n$$\n\n**Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^{+}$)**\nThe $LR^{+}$ is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual.\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}\n$$\nSubstituting the symbolic parameters:\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp}\n$$\n\n**2. Numerical Computation**\n\nWe substitute the given values $\\pi = 0.02$, $Se = 0.90$, and $Sp = 0.95$ into the derived expressions and round to $4$ significant figures.\n\n**$\\mathrm{PPV}$ Calculation:**\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.02)}{(0.90)(0.02) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.02)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + (0.05)(0.98)} = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049} = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.2686567...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $\\mathrm{PPV} \\approx 0.2687$.\n\n**$\\mathrm{NPV}$ Calculation:**\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(1 - 0.02)}{(0.95)(1 - 0.02) + (1 - 0.90)(0.02)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.98)}{(0.95)(0.98) + (0.10)(0.02)} = \\frac{0.931}{0.931 + 0.002} = \\frac{0.931}{0.933}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 0.9978563...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $\\mathrm{NPV} \\approx 0.9979$.\n\n**$LR^{+}$ Calculation:**\n$$\nLR^{+} = \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.95} = \\frac{0.90}{0.05} = 18\n$$\nExpressed with $4$ significant figures, $LR^{+} = 18.00$.\n\n**3. Interpretation in Context**\n\n-   **$\\mathrm{PPV} = 0.2687$**: The positive predictive value indicates that for an asymptomatic individual in this population who receives a positive screening test result, the probability that they actually have colorectal cancer is approximately $26.87\\%$. This relatively low $\\mathrm{PPV}$ is common in screening for diseases with low prevalence and underscores that a positive screening result is not a diagnosis but an indication for further, more definitive diagnostic testing (such as a colonoscopy).\n\n-   **$\\mathrm{NPV} = 0.9979$**: The negative predictive value indicates that for an asymptomatic individual who receives a negative screening test result, the probability that they are truly free of colorectal cancer is $99.79\\%$. This very high $\\mathrm{NPV}$ is a crucial feature of a good screening test, as it provides strong reassurance and effectively rules out the disease in test-negative individuals, fulfilling a primary goal of secondary prevention.\n\n-   **$LR^{+} = 18.00$**: The positive likelihood ratio shows that a positive test result is $18$ times more likely to come from an individual with colorectal cancer than from an individual without the disease. This value quantifies the test's power to increase the certainty of disease, independent of the disease prevalence. A large $LR^{+}$ (typically $10$) indicates that the test provides strong evidence to rule in the disease, significantly shifting the probability from the pre-test (prevalence) to the post-test probability ($\\mathrm{PPV}$).",

Because the management pathway is independent of true disease status conditional on a positive screen, the probability of complication for a false positive case is simply $P(C|T^+)$.\n\n$$E[\\text{Complications from FP}] = E[FP] \\times P(C|T^+)$$\n$$E[\\text{Complications from FP}] = 248.5 \\times 0.0027$$\n$$E[\\text{Complications from FP}] = 0.67095$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$0.67095 \\approx 0.671$$\n\nThus, the expected number of major complications attributable to false positives per $1,000$ individuals screened is $0.671$.",
