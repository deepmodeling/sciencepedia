While traditional office-based measurements are important, Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) is increasingly recognized for providing a more reliable assessment of a patient's usual blood pressure.

            "problem": "A community clinic evaluates Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM) for a patient with suspected hypertension. HBPM is defined as repeated, patient-performed blood pressure measurements at home using a validated automated device under standardized conditions (seated, back supported, feet flat, arm at heart level, after at least $5$ minutes of rest, avoiding caffeine, exercise, and smoking for at least $30$ minutes prior). To minimize initial measurement bias, the first day of readings is excluded when calculating the average. The widely accepted HBPM diagnostic threshold for hypertension is an average systolic blood pressure of at least $135 \\ \\text{mmHg}$ or an average diastolic blood pressure of at least $85 \\ \\text{mmHg}$.\n\nOver $7$ consecutive days, the patient recorded two readings per day (morning and evening). Each reading is recorded as a systolic value $S$ and a diastolic value $D$ in mmHg. The log is:\n\n- Day $1$: Morning $(S,D)=(142, 92)$; Evening $(S,D)=(138, 88)$.\n- Day $2$: Morning $(S,D)=(134, 84)$; Evening $(S,D)=(130, 82)$.\n- Day $3$: Morning $(S,D)=(136, 86)$; Evening $(S,D)=(132, 83)$.\n- Day $4$: Morning $(S,D)=(128, 80)$; Evening $(S,D)=(131, 81)$.\n- Day $5$: Morning $(S,D)=(138, 87)$; Evening $(S,D)=(135, 85)$.\n- Day $6$: Morning $(S,D)=(133, 84)$; Evening $(S,D)=(129, 82)$.\n- Day $7$: Morning $(S,D)=(137, 86)$; Evening $(S,D)=(134, 84)$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the arithmetic mean, compute the HBPM average systolic blood pressure $\\bar{S}$ and average diastolic blood pressure $\\bar{D}$ using all readings from days $2$ through $7$ inclusive. Then, using the HBPM diagnostic threshold stated above, determine the hypertension status indicator $H$, where $H=1$ if the HBPM average indicates hypertension and $H=0$ otherwise.\n\nExpress $\\bar{S}$ and $\\bar{D}$ in mmHg and round each to four significant figures.

It is scientifically grounded in established clinical guidelines for Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM), well-posed with all necessary data and clear instructions, and objective in its formulation. The provided physiological data are realistic. The task is a direct application of statistical calculation and logical decision-making based on defined criteria.\n\nThe task is to compute the average systolic blood pressure ($\\bar{S}$) and average diastolic blood pressure ($\\bar{D}$) from a set of patient recordings, and then determine a hypertension status indicator ($H$).\n\nThe problem specifies that readings from the first day are to be excluded. The data to be analyzed are from Day $2$ to Day $7$, inclusive. There are two readings per day (morning and evening) for $6$ days. Therefore, the total number of readings, $N$, to be included in the average is:\n$$N = 6 \\text{ days} \\times 2 \\text{ readings/day} = 12$$\n\nThe readings from Day $2$ through Day $7$ are as follows:\n- Day $2$: $(134, 84)$, $(130, 82)$\n- Day $3$: $(136, 86)$, $(132, 83)$\n- Day $4$: $(128, 80)$, $(131, 81)$\n- Day $5$: $(138, 87)$, $(135, 85)$\n- Day $6$: $(133, 84)$, $(129, 82)$\n- Day $7$: $(137, 86)$, $(134, 84)$\n\nThe arithmetic mean, $\\bar{x}$, of a set of $N$ values $\\{x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N\\}$ is defined as:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the average systolic blood pressure, $\\bar{S}$.

We collect all $N=12$ diastolic values, $D_i$, from Day $2$ to Day $7$:\n$$D_i \\in \\{84, 82, 86, 83, 80, 81, 87, 85, 84, 82, 86, 84\\}$$\nThe sum of these values is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} D_i = 84 + 82 + 86 + 83 + 80 + 81 + 87 + 85 + 84 + 82 + 86 + 84 = 1004$$\nThe average diastolic pressure is:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{1004}{12} \\approx 83.66666\\ldots$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\bar{D} = 83.67 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nFinally, we determine the hypertension status indicator, $H$. According to the problem, hypertension is diagnosed if the average systolic blood pressure is at least $135$ mmHg or the average diastolic blood pressure is at least $85$ mmHg. This can be expressed as a logical condition:\n$$H = 1 \\text{ if } (\\bar{S} \\ge 135) \\lor (\\bar{D} \\ge 85)$$\n$$H = 0 \\text{ otherwise}$$\nWe test this condition with our calculated and rounded values:\n1.

The condition $83.67 \\ge 85$ is false.\n\nSince both parts of the \"or\" condition are false, the overall condition is false. Therefore, the HBPM average does not indicate hypertension. The status indicator is:\n$$H = 0$$\n\nThe final result is the row vector $(\\bar{S}, \\bar{D}, H)$, which is $(133.1, 83.67, 0)$.",

This is the probability of a positive test in those with disease.\n- Specificity of the screening test, $Sp = 0.90$. This is the probability of a negative test in those without disease.\n- Initial prevalence of hypertension in a lower-risk cohort, $p_1 = 0.15$.\n- Final prevalence of hypertension in a higher-risk cohort, $p_2 = 0.35$.\n- The task is to derive the expression for the positive predictive value ($PPV$) and compute the absolute change in $PPV$ as the prevalence changes from $p_1$ to $p_2$.\n- The derivation must use only the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes’ theorem.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses standard, well-defined concepts from epidemiology and probability theory, namely sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, positive predictive value, and Bayes' theorem. The values provided ($Se=0.85$, $Sp=0.90$, $p \\in [0.15, 0.35]$) are entirely realistic for a medical screening context.

It asks for a unique, quantifiable answer based on the provided data.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from any subjective or non-formalizable elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. It is therefore deemed valid. The solution will now be developed.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has hypertension (the disease), and let $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have hypertension. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given quantities can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.85$\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.90$\n- Prevalence is the probability of disease, $P(D)$. We are given two values: $p_1 = P_1(D) = 0.15$ and $p_2 = P_2(D) = 0.35$.\n\nThe positive predictive value ($PPV$) is the probability that an individual has the disease given a positive test result. This is written as $P(D|T^+)$.\n\nAs required, we use Bayes' theorem to define $PPV$:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test. We can expand this using the law of total probability, conditioning on the disease status:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D) P(D) + P(T^+|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^+|D) = Se$ and $P(D) = p$ (where $p$ is the prevalence). The probability of not having the disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$. The term $P(T^+|D^c)$ is the false positive rate, which is the complement of the specificity, $Sp$. Since an individual without the disease can either test positive or negative, we have $P(T^+|D^c) + P(T^-|D^c) = 1$.\nTherefore, $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these components back into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1-Sp)(1-p)$$\nNow, substituting this full expression for the denominator into Bayes' theorem, we derive the general formula for $PPV$ as a function of prevalence $p$, sensitivity $Se$, and specificity $Sp$:\n$$PPV(p) = \\frac{(Se)(p)}{(Se)(p) + (1-Sp)(1-p)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the positive predictive value.\n\nNext, we compute the $PPV$ for each given prevalence. We are given $Se=0.85$ and $Sp=0.90$, which implies $1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nFor the lower-risk cohort with prevalence $p_1 = 0.15$:\n$$PPV_1 = PPV(0.15) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.15)}{(0.85)(0.15) + (0.10)(1 - 0.15)}$$\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{0.1275}{0.1275 + (0.10)(0.85)} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.1275 + 0.0850} = \\frac{0.1275}{0.2125}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write:\n$$PPV_1 = \\frac{1275}{2125} = \\frac{255}{425} = \\frac{51}{85} = \\frac{3 \\times 17}{5 \\times 17} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\nFor the higher-risk cohort with prevalence $p_2 = 0.35$:\n$$PPV_2 = PPV(0.35) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.35)}{(0.85)(0.35) + (0.10)(1 - 0.35)}$$\n$$PPV_2 = \\frac{0.2975}{0.2975 + (0.10)(0.65)} = \\frac{0.2975}{0.2975 + 0.0650} = \\frac{0.2975}{0.3625}$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can write:\n$$PPV_2 = \\frac{2975}{3625} = \\frac{595}{725} = \\frac{119}{145}$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{119}{145}$ is irreducible because $119 = 7 \\times 17$ and $145 = 5 \\times 29$, which share no common prime factors.\n\nFinally, we compute the absolute change in $PPV$, which is $\\Delta PPV = PPV_2 - PPV_1$.\n$$\\Delta PPV = \\frac{119}{145} - \\frac{3}{5}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $145$.\n$$\\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 29}{5 \\times 29} = \\frac{87}{145}$$\nNow we can compute the difference:\n$$\\Delta PPV = \\frac{119}{145} - \\frac{87}{145} = \\frac{119 - 87}{145} = \\frac{32}{145}$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{32}{145}$ is in simplest form as the prime factors of the numerator are $32 = 2^5$ and the prime factors of the denominator are $145 = 5 \\times 29$.\nThe absolute change in the positive predictive value is $\\frac{32}{145}$.\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.220689...$, which rounds to $0.2207$ to four significant figures.
