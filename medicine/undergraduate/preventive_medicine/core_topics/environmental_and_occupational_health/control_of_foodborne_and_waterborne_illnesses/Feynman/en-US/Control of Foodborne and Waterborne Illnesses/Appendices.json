            "problem": "A catered alumni dinner with a fixed guest list was held on a single evening. The organizers provided the full roster of attendees ($N=200$) and contact information. Within $48$ hours, the health department received reports of acute gastrointestinal illness among attendees and conducted a standardized questionnaire on symptoms and menu item consumption. Of the $N=200$ attendees, $96$ reported illness meeting the case definition within the relevant incubation period. For two illustrative menu items, the following counts were obtained from the completed questionnaires:\n- Chicken salad: $80$ attendees ate it, of whom $60$ became ill; $120$ did not eat it, of whom $36$ became ill.\n- Fruit tart: $50$ attendees ate it, of whom $30$ became ill; $150$ did not eat it, of whom $66$ became ill.\n\nAssume the outbreak is confined to this single event (a closed, well-defined cohort), incubation periods are short (on the order of $1$ to $2$ days), and that measured food-specific attack rates are available for all menu items from the questionnaire data.\n\nUsing core epidemiologic definitions for cumulative incidence (attack rate), risk ratio, and odds and recognizing conditions under which odds ratios approximate risk ratios, which study design is most appropriate to identify the likely implicated food item(s) in this setting, and why?\n\nA.

Cross-sectional study without using the roster, because a single-time survey of current illness status and recalled exposures can efficiently estimate prevalence ratios for each menu item.",
            "solution": "Begin from core epidemiologic definitions applicable to outbreak investigations at a single event with a fixed attendee list.\n\nDefine cumulative incidence (attack rate) over the outbreak period as $AR = \\dfrac{\\text{number of new cases in the period}}{\\text{population at risk at start of the period}}$. In a closed event cohort, all attendees present and at risk at the time of exposure compose the denominator.\n\nDefine the risk ratio for an exposure as $RR = \\dfrac{AR_{\\text{exposed}}}{AR_{\\text{unexposed}}}$. This compares the probability (risk) of disease among exposed versus unexposed persons and requires knowing denominators in both exposure strata.\n\nDefine the odds of disease in a stratum as $\\text{odds} = \\dfrac{P(\\text{disease})}{1 - P(\\text{disease})}$, and define the odds ratio as $OR = \\dfrac{\\text{odds}_{\\text{exposed}}}{\\text{odds}_{\\text{unexposed}}}$. In case-control designs, the $OR$ is the primary measure because risks (and thus $RR$) are not directly estimable from sampled cases and controls. Under the rare disease assumption, when $P(\\text{disease})$ is small (commonly $10\\%$), $OR \\approx RR$; when $P(\\text{disease})$ is large, $OR$ can substantially diverge from $RR$.\n\nApply these to the provided counts to illustrate the information available in this setting:\n\nFor chicken salad:\n- Exposed attack rate: $AR_{\\text{exp}} = \\dfrac{60}{80} = 0.75$ ($75\\%$).\n- Unexposed attack rate: $AR_{\\text{unexp}} = \\dfrac{36}{120} = 0.30$ ($30\\%$).\n- Risk ratio: $RR = \\dfrac{0.75}{0.30} = 2.5$.\n\nCompute odds to show divergence from $RR$ at high attack rates:\n- Exposed odds of illness: $\\dfrac{60}{80 - 60} = \\dfrac{60}{20} = 3$.\n- Unexposed odds of illness: $\\dfrac{36}{120 - 36} = \\dfrac{36}{84} \\approx 0.4286$.\n- Odds ratio: $OR = \\dfrac{3}{0.4286} \\approx 7.0$.\n\nThe overall proportion ill is $\\dfrac{96}{200} = 0.48$ ($48\\%$), which is not rare. The divergence between $RR = 2.5$ and $OR \\approx 7.0$ demonstrates that, in this setting, using an odds ratio as a proxy for a risk ratio would be misleading.\n\nNow evaluate design choices from first principles:\n\n- A retrospective cohort study is indicated when there is a well-defined population at risk at the time of exposure (a closed cohort), exposures have already occurred, and outcomes have occurred within a short, bounded period. With the full guest list and questionnaire data, one can enumerate denominators for each exposure (each menu item) and directly compute food-specific attack rates and risk ratios. This design handles multiple exposures simultaneously and allows stratified or multivariable analyses to control for confounding. It aligns with the need to identify the implicated item(s) by comparing risks across exposure strata.\n\n- A case-control study is most efficient when the source population cannot be fully enumerated or when the outcome is rare, making a cohort approach impractical. In this event, the roster is available, and the outcome is not rare ($48\\%$ ill), violating the rare disease condition. While a case-control study could be conducted, it would preclude direct estimation of attack rates and risk ratios and would rely on odds ratios, which here substantially overestimate the risk ratio.\n\n- A prospective cohort started after the event is inappropriate because both exposures and most outcomes have already occurred given the short incubation. Prospective follow-up would miss or misclassify events and is unnecessary when retrospective ascertainment is feasible.\n\n- A cross-sectional study measures exposure and outcome at the same point in time, estimating prevalence rather than incidence. In an acute outbreak with short incubation, cross-sectional prevalence is a moving target and can obscure temporality and incidence risk. Ignoring the roster would also invite selection bias and impede denominator-based risk estimation.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Retrospective cohort study enumerating the entire guest list, because a closed population with known exposures allows direct calculation and comparison of food-specific attack rates and risk ratios across multiple menu items, and the high proportion ill makes odds ratios a poor proxy for risk ratios.\n- This matches the core conditions: closed cohort, exposures and outcomes have already occurred, full denominators available, and the outcome is not rare. It enables computation of $AR$ and $RR$ as demonstrated. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Case-control study sampling ill attendees as cases and a subset of non-ill attendees as controls, because foodborne outbreaks are rare events and odds ratios will approximate risk ratios even when many attendees are ill.\n- The premise is incorrect here: the outcome is not rare ($48\\%$). The $OR$ does not approximate the $RR$ (approximately $7.0$ versus $2.5$ for the chicken salad example). Furthermore, the roster allows a more informative cohort analysis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Prospective cohort study beginning after the event to follow attendees forward for illness onset, because temporality must be established prospectively when multiple exposures are possible.\n- Temporality can be established retrospectively when exposure timing is known and incubation is short; starting after the event would miss cases and is unnecessary. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Cross-sectional study without using the roster, because a single-time survey of current illness status and recalled exposures can efficiently estimate prevalence ratios for each menu item.\n- Cross-sectional design is suboptimal for acute incidence and causation at a single event, and discarding the roster sacrifices denominator accuracy and increases bias. Verdict — Incorrect.",

The goal is to transform raw numbers on illness and exposure into a clear measure of risk.

            "problem": "A municipal health department investigates acute gastroenteritis following a catered training event. A cohort line list is assembled with exposure information for a specific dish, chicken liver pâté, suspected of being undercooked. A case is defined as new-onset diarrhea with at least three loose stools within $24$ to $72$ hours after the event. Among $180$ attendees, $70$ report eating the chicken liver pâté and $110$ report not eating it. Of those who ate the pâté, $35$ meet the case definition; of those who did not eat the pâté, $15$ meet the case definition. Assume independent Bernoulli outcomes within exposure strata and use large-sample approximations appropriate for cohort data.\n\nTask: From first principles grounded in the binomial model and the normal approximation on the logarithmic scale, derive the incidence (attack rate) in the exposed and unexposed groups, the relative risk (RR) of illness associated with eating the chicken liver pâté, and its ninety-five percent confidence interval (CI). Then, interpret whether the observed association is likely to be causal in this outbreak context, explicitly referencing core epidemiologic criteria such as temporality, strength of association, and biological plausibility.\n\nFor grading purposes, report only the point estimate of the relative risk as your final numeric answer, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required for the final reported quantity.",
            "solution": "The problem provides data from a cohort study of an acute gastroenteritis outbreak and asks for the calculation of key epidemiological measures and an interpretation of causality. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a complete analysis. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nFirst, we organize the provided data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Let $E+$ represent the exposed group (ate chicken liver pâté) and $E-$ represent the unexposed group. Let $D+$ represent the individuals who became ill (cases) and $D-$ represent those who did not.\n\nThe number of exposed individuals is $N_1 = 70$.\nThe number of unexposed individuals is $N_0 = 110$.\nThe total number of attendees is $N = N_1 + N_0 = 70 + 110 = 180$.\n\nThe number of cases among the exposed is $a = 35$.\nThe number of non-cases among the exposed is therefore $b = N_1 - a = 70 - 35 = 35$.\nThe number of cases among the unexposed is $c = 15$.\nThe number of non-cases among the unexposed is therefore $d = N_0 - c = 110 - 15 = 95$.\n\nThe contingency table is as follows:\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cc|c}\n  $D+$ (Cases)  $D-$ (Not Cases)  Total \\\\\n\\hline\n$E+$ (Exposed)  $a = 35$  $b = 35$  $N_1 = 70$ \\\\\n$E-$ (Unexposed)  $c = 15$  $d = 95$  $N_0 = 110$ \\\\\n\\hline\nTotal  $a+c=50$  $b+d=130$  $N=180$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\nThe task requires the following derivations and interpretations:\n\n**1. Incidence (Attack Rate)**\nThe incidence rate in a cohort study, often called the attack rate in an outbreak context, measures the risk of disease in a given group over a specified period.\n\nThe incidence in the exposed group, $I_e$, is the proportion of exposed individuals who become ill.\n$$I_e = \\frac{a}{N_1} = \\frac{35}{70} = 0.5$$\n\nThe incidence in the unexposed group, $I_u$, is the proportion of unexposed individuals who become ill.\n$$I_u = \\frac{c}{N_0} = \\frac{15}{110} = \\frac{3}{22} \\approx 0.1364$$\n\n**2. Relative Risk (RR)**\nThe relative risk is the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group. It quantifies the strength of the association between the exposure and the disease. The point estimate of the relative risk is denoted as $\\hat{RR}$.\n$$\\hat{RR} = \\frac{I_e}{I_u} = \\frac{a/N_1}{c/N_0}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values from the problem:\n$$\\hat{RR} = \\frac{35/70}{15/110} = \\frac{0.5}{15/110} = 0.5 \\times \\frac{110}{15} = \\frac{55}{15} = \\frac{11}{3}$$\nNumerically, this is $\\hat{RR} \\approx 3.6667$.\n\n**3. Ninety-Five Percent Confidence Interval (95% CI) for the RR**\nThe problem specifies using the normal approximation on the logarithmic scale. This method involves calculating the confidence interval for the natural logarithm of the relative risk, $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$, and then exponentiating the interval's endpoints.\n\nThe variance of $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is approximated as:\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{1-I_e}{a} + \\frac{1-I_u}{c}$$\nThis can be expressed using the cell counts from the contingency table:\n$$Var(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\frac{b}{a N_1} + \\frac{d}{c N_0}$$\nThe standard error of $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is the square root of this variance:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{a N_1} + \\frac{d}{c N_0}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{35}{35 \\times 70} + \\frac{95}{15 \\times 110}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{70} + \\frac{95}{1650}}$$\n$$SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR})) \\approx \\sqrt{0.0142857 + 0.0575758} = \\sqrt{0.0718615} \\approx 0.26807$$\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is calculated as $\\ln(\\hat{RR}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\ln(\\hat{RR}))$. For a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha=0.05$ and the critical value $z_{0.975}$ from the standard normal distribution is approximately $1.96$.\nThe point estimate for $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ is $\\ln(11/3) \\approx 1.29928$.\n\nThe limits for the CI of $\\ln(\\hat{RR})$ are:\nLower limit: $1.29928 - 1.96 \\times 0.26807 \\approx 1.29928 - 0.52542 \\approx 0.77386$\nUpper limit: $1.29928 + 1.96 \\times 0.26807 \\approx 1.29928 + 0.52542 \\approx 1.82470$\n\nTo find the $95\\%$ CI for the relative risk itself, we exponentiate these limits:\nLower CI limit for RR: $\\exp(0.77386) \\approx 2.17$\nUpper CI limit for RR: $\\exp(1.82470) \\approx 6.20$\nThe $95\\%$ CI for the relative risk is approximately $(2.17, 6.20)$.\n\n**4. Interpretation of Causal Association**\nThe analysis of causality involves applying established epidemiological criteria.\n\n*   **Temporality**: This criterion is satisfied. The exposure (eating the pâté) occurred at the training event, and the disease onset was subsequently observed between $24$ and $72$ hours later. The exposure preceded the outcome.\n\n*   **Strength of Association**: The calculated relative risk, $\\hat{RR} \\approx 3.67$, indicates a moderately strong association. Those who ate the pâté had a risk of illness that was over $3.6$ times higher than those who did not. The $95\\%$ CI of $(2.17, 6.20)$ does not include the null value of $1.0$, indicating that this association is statistically significant and not likely due to chance.\n\n*   **Biological Plausibility**: The proposed causal mechanism is biologically plausible. Chicken liver pâté, particularly if undercooked, is a known vehicle for foodborne pathogens like *Campylobacter* and *Salmonella*. The incubation period specified in the case definition ($24-72$ hours) is consistent with the known incubation periods for these bacterial infections.\n\nGiven the satisfaction of these fundamental criteria (temporality, strength of association, and biological plausibility), the evidence strongly suggests a causal relationship between consumption of the chicken liver pâté and the gastroenteritis outbreak.\n\nThe final answer is the point estimate of the relative risk, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\hat{RR} = 11/3 \\approx 3.6666...$, which rounds to $3.667$.",

According to the problem statement, $C_{0} = 5$ oocysts per liter.\n\nThe plant employs two unit processes in series:\n1.
