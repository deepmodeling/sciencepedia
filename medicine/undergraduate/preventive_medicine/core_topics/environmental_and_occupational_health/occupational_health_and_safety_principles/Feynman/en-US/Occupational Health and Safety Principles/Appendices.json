            "problem": "A biomedical research laboratory conducts routine work involving multiple processes and materials. The safety officer wishes to prioritize immediate controls using a severity-probability scoring matrix grounded in occupational health and safety risk assessment. A hazard is defined as any source with the potential to cause harm, and risk is the combination of the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event and the severity of its consequences. Consider ordinal severity scores $S \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, where higher values correspond to worse potential outcomes, and ordinal probability scores $P \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, where higher values correspond to greater likelihood of occurrence. Assume the following descriptors guide assignment: severity increases from minor reversible injury ($S=1$) to catastrophic or fatal outcomes ($S=5$), and probability increases from rare ($P=1$) to very likely with frequent exposure ($P=5$). Higher combined severity-probability indicates higher risk.\n\nThe safety officer has enumerated plausible hazards and, based on recent incident logs, equipment status, frequency of tasks, and inherent toxicological and physical properties, has assigned severity and probability categories for each identified hazard:\n\n1. Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens during venipuncture and tube handling in a Biosafety Cabinet (BSC; Biological Safety Cabinet) whose certification is overdue by $2$ months (daily work; one minor needle-stick in the last year): $S=4$, $P=4$.\n2.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Hazard Definition:** Any source with the potential to cause harm.\n- **Risk Definition:** The combination of the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event and the severity of its consequences.\n- **Severity Scores ($S$):** An ordinal scale $S \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, where higher values indicate worse outcomes (from minor reversible injury, $S=1$, to catastrophic/fatal, $S=5$).\n- **Probability Scores ($P$):** An ordinal scale $P \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, where higher values indicate greater likelihood (from rare, $P=1$, to very likely, $P=5$).\n- **Risk Ranking Criterion:** Higher combined severity-probability indicates higher risk.\n- **Enumerated Hazards and Assigned Scores ($S, P$):**\n    1.  **Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens:** $S=4$, $P=4$.\n    2.  **Handling $48\\%$ hydrofluoric acid (HF):** $S=5$, $P=2$.\n    3.  **Transferring liquid nitrogen (LN2):** $S=4$, $P=3$.\n    4.  **Operating an ultracentrifuge:** $S=4$, $P=2$.\n    5.  **Using a ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator:** $S=3$, $P=3$.\n    6.  **Handling powdered carbon nanotubes (CNT):** $S=3$, $P=3$.\n    7.  **Autoclave sterilization:** $S=4$, $P=2$.\n    8.  **Formaldehyde fixation:** $S=3$, $P=2$.\n    9.  **Compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinder changeouts:** $S=4$, $P=2$.\n- **Task:** Select the set of three hazards with the highest combined severity-probability ratings.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical):** The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of occupational health and safety risk assessment. The concepts of hazard, risk, severity, probability, and the use of a scoring matrix are standard in the field. The described laboratory scenarios are realistic and common in biomedical research settings.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data (the list of hazards and their respective $S$ and $P$ scores) and a clear objective (identify the top three hazards by risk rating). The phrase \"combined severity-probability\" is a standard term in risk assessment, most commonly interpreted as the product of the two scores, $R = S \\times P$, which generates a risk score or risk priority number. This interpretation yields a unique ranking. An alternative interpretation, such as a sum $R = S + P$, also produces a consistent (though less discriminating) ranking where the top three identified hazards are the same. Therefore, the problem is well-posed and leads to a unique solution for the set of top three hazards.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The problem is stated objectively. It relies on provided numerical scores for $S$ and $P$ to perform a quantitative ranking, removing subjectivity from the analysis phase. The descriptive text for each hazard serves as justification for the scores but is not required for the calculation itself.\n\nThe problem statement is free of scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradictions, or ambiguity. All required data and definitions are present to arrive at a definitive answer.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe task is to identify the three hazards with the highest risk priority. Risk is defined as a combination of severity ($S$) and probability ($P$). A standard and logical method for quantifying this combination in a risk matrix is to calculate a risk score ($R$) as the product of the severity and probability scores:\n$$R = S \\times P$$\nThis method gives appropriate weight to high scores in either category and provides good discrimination between different hazard scenarios. A higher value of $R$ indicates a higher risk that should be prioritized for control measures.\n\nWe calculate the risk score $R$ for each of the nine listed hazards:\n\n1.  **Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens:**\n    $S=4$, $P=4 \\implies R = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\n2.  **Handling $48\\%$ hydrofluoric acid (HF):**\n    $S=5$, $P=2 \\implies R = 5 \\times 2 = 10$.\n3.  **Transferring liquid nitrogen (LN2):**\n    $S=4$, $P=3 \\implies R = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n4.  **Operating an ultracentrifuge:**\n    $S=4$, $P=2 \\implies R = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n5.  **Using a ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator:**\n    $S=3$, $P=3 \\implies R = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n6.  **Handling powdered carbon nanotubes (CNT):**\n    $S=3$, $P=3 \\implies R = 3 \\times 3 = 9$.\n7.  **Autoclave sterilization:**\n    $S=4$, $P=2 \\implies R = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n8.  **Formaldehyde fixation:**\n    $S=3$, $P=2 \\implies R = 3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n9.  **Compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinder changeouts:**\n    $S=4$, $P=2 \\implies R = 4 \\times 2 = 8$.\n\nNext, we rank the hazards in descending order based on their calculated risk score $R$:\n1.  **Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens** ($R = 16$)\n2.  **Transferring liquid nitrogen (LN2)** ($R = 12$)\n3.  **Handling $48\\%$ hydrofluoric acid (HF)** ($R = 10$)\n4.  Using a ultraviolet (UV) transilluminator ($R = 9$)\n5.  Handling powdered carbon nanotubes (CNT) ($R = 9$)\n6.  Operating an ultracentrifuge ($R = 8$)\n7.  Autoclave sterilization ($R = 8$)\n8.  Compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) cylinder changeouts ($R = 8$)\n9.  Formaldehyde fixation ($R = 6$)\n\nThe three hazards with the highest combined severity-probability ratings are:\n- Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens\n- Transferring liquid nitrogen\n- Handling hydrofluoric acid\n\nNow, each option is evaluated against this result.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Percutaneous exposure to bloodborne pathogens; liquid nitrogen transfer; hydrofluoric acid handling.**\nThis option lists the hazards with the three highest risk scores: $R=16$, $R=12$, and $R=10$. This set corresponds exactly to the top three hazards identified in our ranking.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Ultraviolet transilluminator exposure; powdered carbon nanotube inhalation; hydrofluoric acid handling.**\nThis option lists hazards with risk scores of $R=9$, $R=9$, and $R=10$. This set omits the two highest-risk hazards: bloodborne pathogen exposure ($R=16$) and liquid nitrogen transfer ($R=12$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Autoclave steam burns; compressed gas cylinder changeouts; ultracentrifuge rotor failure.**\nThis option lists hazards that all have a risk score of $R=8$. These are not among the top three highest-risk hazards.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Formaldehyde vapour exposure; ultraviolet transilluminator exposure; autoclave steam burns.**\nThis option lists hazards with risk scores of $R=6$, $R=9$, and $R=8$. This collection does not represent the three hazards with the highest priority for control.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

It is well-posed, with all necessary data and clear definitions provided to allow for a unique solution. The language is objective and free of ambiguity. The provided values are physically and practically plausible within the context of occupational safety. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $P_0$ be the baseline per-task incident probability, given as $P_0 = 1 \\times 10^{-3}$.\nLet $\\eta_{PPE}$ be the efficacy of the PPE control, given as $\\eta_{PPE} = 50\\% = 0.5$.\nLet $\\eta_{EC}$ be the efficacy of the engineering control, given as $\\eta_{EC} = 90\\% = 0.9$.\n\nThe efficacy, $\\eta$, is defined as the proportion by which a control reduces the baseline incident probability. The magnitude of the reduction for a control is $\\eta \\times P_0$. Therefore, the new per-task incident probability, $P_{control}$, when a control is applied is the baseline probability minus this reduction:\n$$P_{control} = P_0 - (\\eta \\times P_0) = P_0(1 - \\eta)$$\n\nUsing this formula, we can calculate the per-task incident probability for each control strategy.\nThe probability with PPE is:\n$$P_{PPE} = P_0(1 - \\eta_{PPE})$$\nThe probability with the engineering control is:\n$$P_{EC} = P_0(1 - \\eta_{EC})$$\n\nThe problem states that the expected incident frequency, $F$, is proportional to the per-task incident probability, $P$. This can be expressed as $F = kP$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\nThus, the expected incident frequency under PPE is $F_{PPE} = k P_{PPE}$, and under the engineering control is $F_{EC} = k P_{EC}$.\n\nWe are asked to quantify the proportional reduction in incident frequency when switching from PPE to the engineering control. The problem defines this as the fraction by which the frequency decreases, relative to the frequency under PPE. Let this proportional reduction be denoted by $R$.\nThe absolute decrease in frequency is $F_{PPE} - F_{EC}$.\nThe proportional reduction relative to the initial frequency ($F_{PPE}$) is:\n$$R = \\frac{F_{PPE} - F_{EC}}{F_{PPE}}$$\nThis can be simplified as:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{F_{EC}}{F_{PPE}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for frequency in terms of probability:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{k P_{EC}}{k P_{PPE}} = 1 - \\frac{P_{EC}}{P_{PPE}}$$\nThe constant of proportionality, $k$, cancels out, indicating the result is independent of the number of tasks performed.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $P_{PPE}$ and $P_{EC}$ in terms of the baseline probability and efficacies:\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{P_0(1 - \\eta_{EC})}{P_0(1 - \\eta_{PPE})}$$\nThe baseline probability, $P_0$, also cancels out. The proportional reduction depends only on the efficacies of the two controls.\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{1 - \\eta_{EC}}{1 - \\eta_{PPE}}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values for the efficacies: $\\eta_{PPE} = 0.5$ and $\\eta_{EC} = 0.9$.\n$$R = 1 - \\frac{1 - 0.9}{1 - 0.5} = 1 - \\frac{0.1}{0.5}$$\n$$R = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be expressed as a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.8$. To express this with four significant figures, we include trailing zeros.\n$$R = 0.8000$$\nThis signifies that switching from a control with $50\\%$ efficacy to one with $90\\%$ efficacy results in an $80.00\\%$ reduction in the expected incident frequency, relative to the frequency under the initial PPE control.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principle of mass conservation, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is stated objectively.\n\nThe physical system is a single, well-mixed compartment. The concentration of the contaminant, $C$, is uniform throughout the room volume $V$ at any given time $t$. The rate of change of the total mass of the contaminant in the room, which is the product $V \\cdot C(t)$, is governed by the conservation of mass. This principle can be stated as:\n\nRate of Accumulation = Rate of Generation - Rate of Removal\n\nThe rate of accumulation of contaminant mass is $\\frac{d(VC)}{dt}$. Since the volume $V$ is constant, this term is $V \\frac{dC}{dt}$.\nThe rate of generation (emission) is given as a constant, $S$.\nThe rate of removal is due to ventilation. Since the room is well-mixed, the concentration of the contaminant in the air leaving the room is the same as the concentration inside the room, $C(t)$. The rate of removal is thus the product of the volumetric flow rate of air, $Q$, and the concentration, $C(t)$, which is $QC(t)$.\n\nThe resulting mass balance equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$V \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = S - Q C(t)$$\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Room volume: $V = 100\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$\n- Emission rate: $S = 50\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{min}$\n- Ventilation rate: $Q = 300\\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{hr}$\n- Initial concentration: $C(0) = 0$\n\nFirst, we must ensure consistency of units.

The concentration $C$ will be in $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^3$.\n\nTo find the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$, we consider the condition where the concentration no longer changes with time. At steady state, $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$.
