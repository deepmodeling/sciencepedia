            "introduction": "Effective injury prevention begins with prioritizing where to focus our efforts, a key goal when applying analytical frameworks like the Haddon Matrix. The Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) is a powerful epidemiological tool that helps us quantify the proportion of injuries in a population that can be attributed to a specific risk factor. By calculating the PAF for a pre-event factor like speeding, as explored in this problem, we can estimate the maximum possible public health gain from an intervention that successfully eliminates that risk.",

            "problem": "A municipal injury prevention team is using the Haddon matrix to prioritize countermeasures for road traffic injuries in the pre-event phase. They focus on speeding as a modifiable pre-event factor. Suppose that, at the population level, the prevalence of exposure to speeding is $P_e = 0.25$ for trips, and that the Relative Risk (RR) comparing injury incidence on speeding trips to non-speeding trips is $RR = 2.0$. Using only the fundamental definitions of risk, Relative Risk (RR), and the counterfactual concept of complete exposure removal without compensatory behavior or other changes, derive an expression for the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) in terms of $P_e$ and $RR$, then compute its value for these parameters. Finally, interpret the computed fraction in terms of the proportion of injury cases that would be prevented if speeding were eliminated under these assumptions. Provide your final numerical answer as a single decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF), compute its value for the given parameters, and interpret the result. The derivation must use fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $E$ be the event of exposure to speeding and $\\bar{E}$ be the event of non-exposure.\nLet $D$ be the outcome of interest, which is a road traffic injury.\nThe prevalence of exposure to speeding in the population of trips is given as $P_e = P(E) = 0.25$.\nThe prevalence of non-exposure is therefore $P(\\bar{E}) = 1 - P_e = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$.\n\nLet $I_e$ be the incidence (risk) of injury in the exposed group (those who are speeding). This is the conditional probability $P(D|E)$.\nLet $I_{\\bar{e}}$ be the incidence of injury in the unexposed group (those not speeding). This is the conditional probability $P(D|\\bar{E})$.\n\nThe Relative Risk ($RR$) is the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n$$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_{\\bar{e}}}$$\nWe are given $RR = 2.0$. This implies $I_e = RR \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}} = 2.0 \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}}$.\n\nThe total incidence of injury in the population, $I_{total}$, can be calculated using the law of total probability. It is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups, where the weights are the prevalences of these subgroups in the population.\n$$I_{total} = P(D) = P(D|E)P(E) + P(D|\\bar{E})P(\\bar{E})$$\nSubstituting the defined symbols:\n$$I_{total} = I_e \\cdot P_e + I_{\\bar{e}} \\cdot (1 - P_e)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $I_e$ in terms of $RR$ and $I_{\\bar{e}}$ into the equation for $I_{total}$:\n$$I_{total} = (RR \\cdot I_{\\bar{e}}) \\cdot P_e + I_{\\bar{e}} \\cdot (1 - P_e)$$\nWe can factor out $I_{\\bar{e}}$:\n$$I_{total} = I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + (1 - P_e)]$$\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) represents the proportion of all disease cases in the population that can be attributed to the exposure. It is defined as the fractional reduction in total incidence that would be achieved if the exposure were eliminated from the population. The \"counterfactual\" incidence in the population, if the exposure were eliminated, would be $I_{\\bar{e}}$, as everyone would then have the risk of the unexposed group.\nThe definition of PAF is:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{total} - (\\text{incidence if exposure is eliminated})}{I_{total}} = \\frac{I_{total} - I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{total}}$$\nThis can also be written as $PAF = 1 - \\frac{I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{total}}$.\n\nTo derive the expression for PAF in terms of $P_e$ and $RR$, we substitute the expression for $I_{total}$ into the PAF formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e] - I_{\\bar{e}}}{I_{\\bar{e}} [RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e]}$$\nThe term $I_{\\bar{e}}$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out (assuming $I_{\\bar{e}} > 0$):\n$$PAF = \\frac{[RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e] - 1}{RR \\cdot P_e + 1 - P_e}$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{RR \\cdot P_e - P_e}{RR \\cdot P_e - P_e + 1}$$\nFactoring out $P_e$ in the numerator gives the final derived expression:\n$$PAF = \\frac{P_e (RR - 1)}{P_e (RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of PAF using the given parameters: $P_e = 0.25$ and $RR = 2.0$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25 (2.0 - 1.0)}{0.25 (2.0 - 1.0) + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25 (1.0)}{0.25 (1.0) + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25}{0.25 + 1.0}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.25}{1.25}$$\n$$PAF = \\frac{1/4}{5/4} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a single decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$PAF = 0.2000$$\n\nFinally, we interpret this result. A PAF of $0.2000$ means that $20.00\\%$ of all road traffic injuries in this population are attributable to the risk factor of speeding. In the counterfactual scenario where speeding is completely eliminated (and assuming no other changes in behavior or risk), there would be a $20.00\\%$ reduction in the total incidence of road traffic injuries. This metric is crucial for the injury prevention team as it quantifies the maximum potential benefit of a successful intervention targeting speeding.",

In a fleet cohort under baseline conditions, the expected number of fatalities in a fixed exposure window is $1{,}000$ without any interventions.

This final practice problem presents a complex but realistic situation where a pre-event change increases crash risk while an event-phase intervention aims to reduce injury severity.

The pre-event change is that the mean cycling speed increases by $5\\%$ following road redesign. The event-phase change is that a helmet promotion campaign increases the helmet-wearing proportion from $50\\%$ to $80\\%$. The department wishes to estimate the net change in expected severe head injuries per trip relative to baseline.\n\nUse the following scientifically justified modeling assumptions grounded in the Haddon matrix. First, model the expected number of severe head injuries per trip as proportional to the product of two factors: the crash occurrence factor and the conditional severity factor given a crash. Second, assume the crash occurrence factor scales with the square of mean speed, reflecting the fundamental kinetic energy dependence $E \\propto v^{2}$ as a surrogate for crash risk intensity. Third, assume the conditional severity factor is reduced by $40\\%$ among helmeted cyclists and unchanged among non-helmeted cyclists, and that helmet use does not itself alter the probability of a crash. Treat all other determinants as unchanged.\n\nLet $v_{0}$ denote the baseline mean speed and $v_{1} = 1.05\\, v_{0}$ the post-change mean speed. Let the population helmet-wearing proportions be $p_{0} = 0.50$ at baseline and $p_{1} = 0.80$ post-change. For a non-helmeted cyclist, set the baseline conditional severe head injury factor to $1$, and for a helmeted cyclist use a multiplicative factor of $0.60$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, compute the net multiplicative change in expected severe head injuries per trip relative to baseline (post-change divided by baseline).

            "solution": "We apply a Haddon matrix logic, separating pre-event and event-phase determinants and modeling expected severe head injuries per trip as the product of a crash occurrence factor and a conditional severity factor. The pre-event change concerns speed, and the event-phase change concerns helmet protection.\n\nFoundational principles and definitions:\n1. Kinetic energy scales as $E \\propto v^{2}$. In injury epidemiology, speed-squared is frequently used as a surrogate that influences both the likelihood and intensity of crash forces. We adopt the modeling assumption that the crash occurrence factor scales with $v^{2}$, holding exposure otherwise constant.\n2. The conditional severity of head injury given a crash is reduced by $40\\%$ for helmeted cyclists. Interpreting this as a multiplicative relative reduction, the severity factor is $1$ for non-helmeted and $0.60$ for helmeted cyclists.\n3. Population-average severity factor is the proportion-weighted average across helmeted and non-helmeted riders.
