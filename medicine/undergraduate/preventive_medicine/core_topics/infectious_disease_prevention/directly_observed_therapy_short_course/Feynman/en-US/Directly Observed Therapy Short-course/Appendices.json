            "problem": "A public health program implements Directly Observed Therapy Short-course (DOTS) for tuberculosis and Programmatic Management of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (PMDT) for Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). In a fixed quarterly cohort, the cascade of care is defined in ordered stages from diagnosis to cure: diagnosis, completion of pre-treatment evaluation, initiation of appropriate second-line therapy, culture conversion by month six, completion of the continuation phase, and documented cure. In cohort analysis, attrition at a stage is defined as the fraction of individuals who enter that stage but do not transition to the next stage due to loss to follow-up or treatment failure; deaths are excluded from the attrition metric.\n\nYou are given the following stage-entry counts and event counts for a single cohort:\n- Diagnosed MDR-TB patients entering the diagnosis stage: $N_{0} = 560$.\n- Loss to follow-up and failure between diagnosis and pre-treatment evaluation: $\\text{LTFU}_{0} = 40$, $\\text{FAIL}_{0} = 0$; deaths in this interval: $\\text{DEATH}_{0} = 2$. The number completing pre-treatment evaluation is $N_{1} = 560 - 40 - 2 = 518$.\n- Loss to follow-up and failure between pre-treatment evaluation and treatment initiation: $\\text{LTFU}_{1} = 20$, $\\text{FAIL}_{1} = 0$; deaths: $\\text{DEATH}_{1} = 1$.

We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks to find the largest stage-specific attrition proportion in a cascade of care for MDR-TB patients. Attrition at a stage is defined as the fraction of individuals entering the stage who are lost to follow-up or experience treatment failure, excluding deaths. The formula for attrition at stage $i$, denoted $A_i$, is given by:\n$$A_i = \\frac{\\text{LTFU}_i + \\text{FAIL}_i}{N_i}$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of patients entering stage $i$, and $\\text{LTFU}_i$ and $\\text{FAIL}_i$ are the number of patients lost to follow-up and failing treatment in the interval following stage $i$, respectively.\n\nThe cascade has five intervals where attrition can occur.

Monthly facility consumption is driven by the random number of enrolled patients and is modeled as a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with constant mean and variability across months. Assume the following scientifically grounded base:\n- Monthly consumption in packs is represented by independent random variables with mean $\\mu$ packs and standard deviation $\\sigma$ packs.\n- Over a lead time of $L$ months, the cumulative demand is the sum of $L$ independent monthly demands.\n- By the Central Limit Theorem, the cumulative demand over the lead time can be treated as approximately normal, allowing service levels to be set using standard normal quantiles.\n\nThe program targets a one-sided non-stockout probability of $0.95$ during the lead time.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard statistical inventory control theory, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D_i$ be the random variable representing the number of patient-month treatment packs consumed in month $i$. According to the problem statement, the monthly consumptions are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a mean $E[D_i] = \\mu$ and a standard deviation $SD[D_i] = \\sigma$.\n\nThe procurement lead time is given as $L$ months. The cumulative demand over this lead time, which we denote as $D_{LT}$, is the sum of the demands for each of the $L$ months:\n$$D_{LT} = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} D_i$$\n\nWe first determine the mean and standard deviation of the cumulative lead-time demand, $D_{LT}$.\n\nThe mean of the sum of random variables is the sum of their means. Due to the i.i.d. property:\n$$E[D_{LT}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L} D_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} E[D_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\mu = L\\mu$$\n\nThe variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of their variances. The variance of the monthly demand is $Var(D_i) = \\sigma^2$. Therefore, the variance of the lead-time demand is:\n$$Var(D_{LT}) = Var\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{L} D_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} Var(D_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{L} \\sigma^2 = L\\sigma^2$$\n\nThe standard deviation of the lead-time demand, $\\sigma_{LT}$, is the square root of its variance:\n$$\\sigma_{LT} = \\sqrt{Var(D_{LT})} = \\sqrt{L\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{L}$$\n\nThe problem states that by the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of $D_{LT}$ can be approximated as a normal distribution with the calculated mean and variance:\n$$D_{LT} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\text{mean}=L\\mu, \\text{variance}=L\\sigma^2)$$\n\nThe minimum stock level, $B$, must be set to achieve a non-stockout probability of $0.95$. This means the probability that the lead-time demand $D_{LT}$ is less than or equal to the stock level $B$ must be $0.95$.\n$$P(D_{LT} \\le B) = 0.95$$\n\nTo evaluate this probability using the standard normal distribution, we standardize the random variable $D_{LT}$. Let $Z$ be the standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The standardization is performed as follows:\n$$Z = \\frac{D_{LT} - E[D_{LT}]}{\\sigma_{LT}} = \\frac{D_{LT} - L\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{L}}$$\nApplying this to our probability statement:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{D_{LT} - L\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{L}} \\le \\frac{B - L\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{L}}\\right) = 0.95$$\n$$P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{B - L\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{L}}\\right) = 0.95$$\n\nWe are given that $z$ is the standard normal quantile corresponding to the $0.95$ one-sided probability. This means $P(Z \\le z) = 0.95$. By comparing the two probability statements, we can set the arguments of the probability function equal:\n$$\\frac{B - L\\mu}{\\sigma\\sqrt{L}} = z$$\n\nSolving this equation for $B$ yields the general closed-form expression for the minimum stock level:\n$$B = L\\mu + z \\sigma \\sqrt{L}$$\n\nThis expression has a clear interpretation in the context of DOTS supply planning:\n1.  The term $L\\mu$ is the **cycle stock**. This is the average number of treatment packs expected to be consumed during the procurement lead time. It represents the stock needed to cover average patient needs while waiting for a new order to arrive.\n2.  The term $z \\sigma \\sqrt{L}$ is the **safety stock**. This is the additional buffer inventory held to protect against greater-than-average demand during the lead time, thereby preventing stockouts. It is the product of the safety factor $z$ (which reflects the desired service level) and the standard deviation of lead-time demand $\\sigma\\sqrt{L}$ (which quantifies demand uncertainty over the lead time). For a life-saving program like DOTS, a high service level and thus a significant safety stock are critical to ensure continuity of care.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $B$ using the provided parameters:\n-   Average monthly consumption $\\mu = 320$ packs\n-   Lead time $L = 3$ months\n-   Monthly demand standard deviation $\\sigma = 40$ packs\n-   One-sided service level quantile $z = 1.645$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$B = (3)(320) + (1.645)(40)\\sqrt{3}$$\n$$B = 960 + 65.8\\sqrt{3}$$\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{3} \\approx 1.73205$:\n$$B \\approx 960 + 65.8 \\times 1.73205$$\n$$B \\approx 960 + 113.96889$$\n$$B \\approx 1073.96889$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$B \\approx 1074$$\nTherefore, the minimum stock level required is $1074$ patient-month treatment packs.",
