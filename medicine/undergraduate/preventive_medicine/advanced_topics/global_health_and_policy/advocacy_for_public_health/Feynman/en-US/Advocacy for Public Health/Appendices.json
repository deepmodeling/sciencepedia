            "introduction": "Effective public health advocacy begins with a clear, quantitative statement of the problem. To persuade policymakers, it is not enough to say a risk factor is dangerous; we must show how much it burdens the entire community. This exercise introduces the Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$), a powerful epidemiological metric that estimates the proportion of disease cases in a population that can be attributed to a specific exposure. By working through the derivation and calculation of $PAF$ , you will learn how to translate raw data on risk and prevalence into a single, compelling figure that makes the case for intervention.",

            "problem": "A county health department is preparing an advocacy brief to prioritize obesity prevention as a strategy to reduce incident hypertension. A recent cohort study in the county reports a Relative Risk (RR) of obesity for incident hypertension of $RR=1.6$, and a community survey estimates the obesity prevalence as $p=0.35$. Assume the standard definitions of incidence in the exposed and unexposed groups, and that the overall population incidence is the weighted average of subgroup incidences by exposure prevalence.\n\nTasks:\n1) Using only core definitions, derive a closed-form expression for the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) in terms of the exposure prevalence $p$ and the Relative Risk $RR$. You may introduce symbols for the incidence in exposed and unexposed groups as needed, but do not assume any numerical values for these incidences.\n2) Compute the PAF for obesity-related hypertension using $RR=1.6$ and $p=0.35$. Express the final PAF as a decimal fraction and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.\n3) Briefly explain, in one or two sentences grounded in core definitions, the conceptual difference between Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) and Attributable Risk (AR), and why PAF is often more directly useful for public health advocacy at the population level.\n\nReport only the numerical value from Task $2$ as your final answer. Do not include units and do not use the percent sign; express the value as a pure decimal fraction rounded to $4$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded in the field of epidemiology and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. We proceed with the tasks as outlined.\n\nLet $I_e$ represent the incidence of hypertension in the exposed group (individuals with obesity) and $I_u$ be the incidence in the unexposed group (individuals without obesity). The prevalence of the exposure (obesity) in the population is given by $p$.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n1.  **Relative Risk ($RR$)**: The ratio of incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group.\n    $$RR = \\frac{I_e}{I_u}$$\n2.  **Population Incidence ($I_{pop}$)**: The overall incidence of the disease in the total population. As stated, this is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed subgroups.\n    $$I_{pop} = p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u$$\n3.  **Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$)**: The proportion of the disease incidence in the total population that is due to the exposure. It is calculated as the reduction in population incidence that would occur if the exposure were eliminated, divided by the total population incidence. If the exposure were eliminated, the entire population would have the baseline incidence of the unexposed, $I_u$.\n    $$PAF = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_u}{I_{pop}}$$\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the closed-form expression for PAF**\n\nOur objective is to express $PAF$ solely in terms of $p$ and $RR$. We begin with the definition of $PAF$ and substitute the expressions for $I_{pop}$ and $I_e$.\n\nFirst, substitute the expression for $I_{pop}$ into the $PAF$ formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u) - I_u}{p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nSimplify the numerator:\n$$(p \\cdot I_e + I_u - p \\cdot I_u) - I_u = p \\cdot I_e - p \\cdot I_u = p(I_e - I_u)$$\nThe expression for $PAF$ becomes:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(I_e - I_u)}{p \\cdot I_e + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nNow, we must eliminate $I_e$ and $I_u$. From the definition of $RR$, we have $I_e = RR \\cdot I_u$. We substitute this into the expression for $PAF$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p( (RR \\cdot I_u) - I_u)}{p(RR \\cdot I_u) + (1-p) \\cdot I_u}$$\nFactor out $I_u$ from the terms in both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot I_u (RR - 1)}{I_u [p \\cdot RR + (1-p)]}$$\nThe term $I_u$ is a common factor and cancels out, assuming $I_u \\neq 0$ (which is required for $RR$ to be well-defined and for the problem to be non-trivial). This cancellation is critical as it shows that $PAF$ is independent of the baseline incidence of the disease.\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p}$$\nThis can be rearranged into a common alternative form by factoring the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{1 + p(RR - 1)}$$\nBoth expressions are equivalent and represent the derived closed-form solution.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the PAF**\n\nWe are given the values $p = 0.35$ and $RR = 1.6$. We substitute these into the derived formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35(1.6 - 1)}{1 + 0.35(1.6 - 1)}$$\nFirst, calculate the term $(1.6 - 1)$:\n$$1.6 - 1 = 0.6$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.35(0.6)}{1 + 0.35(0.6)}$$\nCalculate the products in the numerator and denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{0.21}{1 + 0.21} = \\frac{0.21}{1.21}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$PAF \\approx 0.173553719...$$\nThe problem requires rounding to $4$ significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $7$, $3$, and $5$. The fifth digit is a $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$PAF \\approx 0.1736$$\n\n**Task 3: Conceptual Difference between PAF and Attributable Risk (AR)**\n\nAttributable Risk, $AR = I_e - I_u$, is the absolute excess incidence in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group, measuring the burden of disease among those with the risk factor. In contrast, the Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_u}{I_{pop}}$, is the proportion of a disease in the total population that is attributable to the risk factor, making it more useful for public health advocacy because it quantifies the potential impact of a population-wide intervention by incorporating both the risk factor's prevalence ($p$) and the strength of its association with the disease ($RR$).",

            "introduction": "Once a problem is defined, advocacy must articulate the tangible benefits of a proposed solution. To compare different health interventions and justify investments, we need a common currency for health outcomes. This practice focuses on the Disability-Adjusted Life Year ($DALY$), the global standard for measuring the burden of disease. By calculating the total $DALYs$ averted by a hypothetical policy , you will gain a practical understanding of how to quantify the comprehensive value of a public health program, combining its impact on both mortality and morbidity.",

            "problem": "A public health advocacy coalition is preparing an impact brief to support a preventive policy that reduces exposure to a known risk factor. Over a period of $10$ years, the policy is credibly projected to avert $200$ premature deaths, where the average standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death for these individuals is $25$ years. Over the same period, the policy is also expected to avert $1{,}000$ incident nonfatal cases of a specific condition, each episode lasting $2$ years with a constant disability weight of $0.2$.\n\nAssume the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework, with Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) defined as the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD). Assume no discounting and no age-weighting. For each averted death, attribute the full standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death. For each averted nonfatal case, attribute the full episode duration at the stated disability weight. Do not truncate durations at the end of the $10$-year period.\n\nUsing only these core definitions, compute the total number of DALYs averted by the policy attributable to these outcomes. Express your final answer in years as an exact integer (no rounding).",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be sound. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of public health and epidemiology, specifically the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) framework. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and quantitative. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the total Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted by a public health policy. According to the GBD framework definition provided, the DALY is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability (YLD) due to morbidity.\nThe total DALYs averted, denoted as $DALY_{averted}$, can be expressed as:\n$$DALY_{averted} = YLL_{averted} + YLD_{averted}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total YLL averted. This component represents the years of life saved by preventing premature deaths.\nThe problem states that the number of premature deaths averted, $N_{deaths}$, is $200$.\nThe average standard remaining life expectancy at the age of death, $L$, is $25$ years.\nThe problem specifies that there is no age-weighting or discounting. Therefore, the total YLL averted is the simple product of the number of deaths averted and the life expectancy lost per death.\n$$YLL_{averted} = N_{deaths} \\times L$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$YLL_{averted} = 200 \\times 25 = 5000 \\text{ years}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total YLD averted. This component represents the years of healthy life gained by preventing nonfatal cases of a specific condition.\nThe number of averted incident nonfatal cases, $N_{cases}$, is $1,000$.\nThe duration of each disease episode, $d$, is $2$ years.\nThe disability weight, $DW$, for the condition is $0.2$. The disability weight is a factor on a scale from $0$ (perfect health) to $1$ (equivalent to death).\nThe total YLD averted is the product of the number of cases averted, the duration of each case, and the disability weight. The problem instruction to not truncate durations at the end of the $10$-year period means we use the full episode duration for the calculation.\n$$YLD_{averted} = N_{cases} \\times d \\times DW$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$YLD_{averted} = 1,000 \\times 2 \\times 0.2$$\n$$YLD_{averted} = 1,000 \\times 0.4 = 400 \\text{ years}$$\n\nFinally, to find the total DALYs averted, we sum the YLL and YLD components.\n$$DALY_{averted} = YLL_{averted} + YLD_{averted}$$\n$$DALY_{averted} = 5000 + 400$$\n$$DALY_{averted} = 5400 \\text{ years}$$\n\nThe $10$-year period mentioned in the problem statement is the time frame during which the $200$ deaths and $1,000$ cases are averted. It does not act as a limiter on the calculation of years of life lost or lived with disability stemming from those events. The calculation correctly adheres to this by attributing the full $25$ years of life expectancy and the full $2$-year episode duration. The final answer is an exact integer as required.",

This quantitative approach helps transform strategic intuition into a transparent and defensible action plan.",

            "problem": "A municipal coalition focused on preventive medicine is planning an advocacy campaign for a policy that restricts placement and promotion of sugar-sweetened beverages within school zones to reduce childhood obesity and long-term cardiometabolic risk. The coalition must prioritize which stakeholders to engage first. They have quantified each stakeholder’s decision-making influence and policy alignment on normalized scales where $0$ denotes no influence or complete misalignment and $1$ denotes maximal influence or complete alignment.\n\nFoundational principles from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) dictate that when criteria are on commensurate, normalized scales and judged to contribute independently to the overall objective, a linear additive value model can be constructed. In such a model, each criterion receives a nonnegative weight that reflects its relative importance to achieving the advocacy objective, and the weights sum to $1$. The coalition’s objective is to maximize the expected progress toward policy adoption under limited resources, and they judge that decision-making influence should have greater weight than policy alignment, while still valuing alignment substantially. Based on this objective, they set the weights for influence and alignment as $w_I = 0.6$ and $w_A = 0.4$, respectively, with $w_I + w_A = 1$.\n\nThe stakeholders and their scores are:\n- City Council Chair: influence $I = 0.95$, alignment $A = 0.60$.\n- Health Department Director: influence $I = 0.80$, alignment $A = 0.90$.\n- Retailers Association Leader: influence $I = 0.70$, alignment $A = 0.20$.\n- Parent-Teacher Association President: influence $I = 0.50$, alignment $A = 0.85$.\n- Youth Advocacy Group Coordinator: influence $I = 0.40$, alignment $A = 0.95$.\n\nUsing only the MCDA additive value model with the stated weights, first derive the prioritization score $S$ as a function of $I$ and $A$. Then compute the prioritization score for each stakeholder, identify the highest-priority stakeholder, and report the maximum prioritization score. Round your reported maximum prioritization score to four significant figures. Express your final numerical answer as unitless.",
            "solution": "The coalition aims to select stakeholders to maximize expected progress toward policy adoption under resource constraints. A suitable fundamental base is the additive value function from Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which is appropriate when:\n1. Criteria are normalized to a common interval, here $[0,1]$ for both influence and alignment.\n2. Criteria are preferentially independent with respect to the advocacy objective, meaning the trade-offs between the criteria do not depend on the levels of other criteria.\n3. Weights reflect the relative importance of each criterion and sum to $1$.\n\nUnder MCDA, the overall prioritization score $S$ for a stakeholder is given by a weighted sum of criterion-specific value scores. Let $I$ denote influence and $A$ denote alignment, with weights $w_I$ and $w_A$ such that $w_I + w_A = 1$ and $w_I, w_A \\geq 0$. The additive value model is:\n$$\nS(I,A) = w_I \\, I + w_A \\, A.\n$$\nGiven $w_I = 0.6$ and $w_A = 0.4$, the prioritization score becomes:\n$$\nS(I,A) = 0.6\\,I + 0.4\\,A.\n$$\n\nJustification of the weights based on advocacy objectives: In public health advocacy, policy adoption frequently depends on gatekeepers and decision-makers whose choices can be pivotal. The marginal effect of increasing engagement with a highly influential stakeholder on the probability of policy success can exceed the marginal effect of increasing alignment among less influential stakeholders. However, alignment remains critical because highly influential but misaligned stakeholders can impede progress. Therefore, assigning $w_I = 0.6$ and $w_A = 0.4$ reflects a strategy to prioritize engagement where it most increases expected policy success while maintaining sufficient attention to alignment to secure cooperation and minimize opposition.\n\nWe now compute $S$ for each stakeholder:\n\n1. City Council Chair: $I = 0.95$, $A = 0.60$.\n$$\nS = 0.6 \\times 0.95 + 0.4 \\times 0.60 = 0.57 + 0.24 = 0.81.\n$$\n\n2. Health Department Director: $I = 0.80$, $A = 0.90$.\n$$\nS = 0.6 \\times 0.80 + 0.4 \\times 0.90 = 0.48 + 0.36 = 0.84.\n$$\n\n3. Retailers Association Leader: $I = 0.70$, $A = 0.20$.\n$$\nS = 0.6 \\times 0.70 + 0.4 \\times 0.20 = 0.42 + 0.08 = 0.50.\n$$\n\n4. Parent-Teacher Association President: $I = 0.50$, $A = 0.85$.\n$$\nS = 0.6 \\times 0.50 + 0.4 \\times 0.85 = 0.30 + 0.34 = 0.64.\n$$\n\n5. Youth Advocacy Group Coordinator: $I = 0.40$, $A = 0.95$.\n$$\nS = 0.6 \\times 0.40 + 0.4 \\times 0.95 = 0.24 + 0.38 = 0.62.\n$$\n\nThe scores are: City Council Chair $0.81$, Health Department Director $0.84$, Retailers Association Leader $0.50$, Parent-Teacher Association President $0.64$, Youth Advocacy Group Coordinator $0.62$.\n\nThe highest-priority stakeholder is the Health Department Director with $S = 0.84$.
