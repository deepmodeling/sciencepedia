            "introduction": "A key step in prioritizing public health interventions is to understand how much of a disease burden is linked to a specific, modifiable risk factor. The Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$) is a fundamental metric for this purpose, connecting the prevalence of an exposure and its associated risk to the overall health of a population. This exercise  provides hands-on practice in calculating the $PAF$ and demonstrates how a Health in All Policies (HiAP) intervention that reduces exposure prevalence can directly lower the proportion of the disease burden attributable to that risk factor.",

            "problem": "A metropolitan government adopts the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach to integrate public health objectives into urban transport regulation by lowering residential street speed limits. Consider a dichotomous exposure, where individuals are classified as either exposed to high-speed travel (above the new limit) or unexposed (at or below the new limit). Let $p$ denote the prevalence of exposure to high-speed travel, $I_{1}$ denote the incidence of severe road traffic injury among the exposed, $I_{0}$ denote the incidence among the unexposed, and $RR$ denote the relative risk defined by $RR = I_{1}/I_{0}$. The population incidence is $I_{\\text{pop}} = p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}$, and the population attributable fraction is defined as the fraction of the population incidence that would be avoided if exposure were eliminated: $PAF = \\dfrac{I_{\\text{pop}} - I_{0}}{I_{\\text{pop}}}$.\n\nA city called Metrovia reduces the prevalence of high-speed exposure from $p_{0} = 0.40$ to $p_{1} = 0.25$ under the speed limit policy. Empirical studies in similar contexts estimate the relative risk of severe injury for high-speed exposure versus unexposed travel as $RR = 2.5$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and standard properties of ratios, derive an expression for $PAF$ in terms of $p$ and $RR$, then compute the change in population attributable fraction $\\Delta PAF = PAF(p_{1}) - PAF(p_{0})$ for Metrovia.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$) in terms of prevalence ($p$) and relative risk ($RR$); second, the computation of the change in $PAF$ ($\\Delta PAF$); and third, a brief interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of PAF in terms of $p$ and $RR$**\n\nThe definition of the Population Attributable Fraction ($PAF$) is given as:\n$$PAF = \\frac{I_{\\text{pop}} - I_{0}}{I_{\\text{pop}}}$$\nwhere $I_{\\text{pop}}$ is the population incidence and $I_{0}$ is the incidence in the unexposed group.\n\nThe population incidence $I_{\\text{pop}}$ is defined as a weighted average of the incidence in the exposed group ($I_{1}$) and the unexposed group ($I_{0}$), with the prevalence of exposure ($p$) as the weighting factor:\n$$I_{\\text{pop}} = p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $I_{\\text{pop}}$ into the $PAF$ formula:\n$$PAF = \\frac{(p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}) - I_{0}}{p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}}$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p I_{1} + I_{0} - p I_{0} - I_{0}}{p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}} = \\frac{p I_{1} - p I_{0}}{p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}}$$\nFactoring out $p$ from the numerator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(I_{1} - I_{0})}{p I_{1} + (1-p) I_{0}}$$\nThe relative risk ($RR$) is defined as the ratio of incidence in the exposed to the unexposed:\n$$RR = \\frac{I_{1}}{I_{0}}$$\nThis implies $I_{1} = RR \\cdot I_{0}$. We can substitute this into the expression for $PAF$ to eliminate $I_{1}$ and $I_{0}$.\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR \\cdot I_{0} - I_{0})}{p(RR \\cdot I_{0}) + (1-p)I_{0}}$$\nAssuming the incidence in the unexposed is non-zero ($I_{0} \\neq 0$), which is necessary for the problem to be meaningful, we can factor $I_{0}$ out of both the numerator and the denominator:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p \\cdot I_{0}(RR - 1)}{I_{0}[p \\cdot RR + (1-p)]}$$\nCanceling the common term $I_{0}$:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p \\cdot RR + 1 - p}$$\nThis can be rearranged slightly for clarity:\n$$PAF = \\frac{p(RR - 1)}{p(RR - 1) + 1}$$\nThis is the required expression for $PAF$ in terms of the prevalence of exposure $p$ and the relative risk $RR$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\Delta PAF$ for Metrovia**\n\nWe are given the initial prevalence $p_{0} = 0.40$, the final prevalence after the policy intervention $p_{1} = 0.25$, and the relative risk $RR = 2.5$. We use the derived formula to compute the $PAF$ before and after the intervention.\n\nThe initial Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF(p_{0})$, is:\n$$PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{p_{0}(RR - 1)}{p_{0}(RR - 1) + 1} = \\frac{0.40(2.5 - 1)}{0.40(2.5 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{0.40(1.5)}{0.40(1.5) + 1} = \\frac{0.6}{0.6 + 1} = \\frac{0.6}{1.6} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\nSo, initially, $37.5\\%$ of severe injuries were attributable to high-speed travel.\n\nThe final Population Attributable Fraction, $PAF(p_{1})$, is:\n$$PAF(p_{1}) = \\frac{p_{1}(RR - 1)}{p_{1}(RR - 1) + 1} = \\frac{0.25(2.5 - 1)}{0.25(2.5 - 1) + 1}$$\n$$PAF(p_{1}) = \\frac{0.25(1.5)}{0.25(1.5) + 1} = \\frac{0.375}{0.375 + 1} = \\frac{0.375}{1.375} = \\frac{3}{11}$$\nAs a decimal, $PAF(p_{1}) \\approx 0.2727...$ So, after the intervention, approximately $27.3\\%$ of severe injuries are attributable to high-speed travel.\n\nThe change in the Population Attributable Fraction, $\\Delta PAF$, is the difference between the final and initial values:\n$$\\Delta PAF = PAF(p_{1}) - PAF(p_{0}) = \\frac{3}{11} - \\frac{3}{8}$$\n$$\\Delta PAF = \\frac{24 - 33}{88} = -\\frac{9}{88} \\approx -0.1022727...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta PAF \\approx -0.1023$$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe sign of $\\Delta PAF$ is negative, indicating a reduction in the population attributable fraction. The magnitude of $-0.1023$ means that the Health in All Policies (HiAP) intervention, by lowering the prevalence of the risk factor (high-speed travel), reduced the proportion of the total severe injury burden attributable to that risk factor by approximately $10.23$ percentage points.\n\nThis reduction represents a significant public health achievement. From an equity perspective, PAF quantifies the burden of disease that is, in theory, preventable and unevenly distributed (i.e., it falls upon the exposed group). By reducing the PAF, the policy has not only lowered the overall injury burden but has also made the distribution of risk more equitable across the population, as a smaller fraction of the total health outcome is now explained by this specific, modifiable exposure.",

A Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is commissioned to estimate the expected annual number of avoided all-cause deaths attributable to a reduction in fine particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to $2.5$ micrometers ($\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$). Assume the following scientifically grounded inputs and relationships:\n\n- The adult population size is $N = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$ persons.\n- The baseline all-cause mortality rate is $y_{0} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ deaths per person per year.\n- The proposed policy is expected to reduce annual average $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ by $\\Delta C = 3.2\\ \\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n- The concentration–response relationship for all-cause mortality follows a widely used log-linear form with a relative risk $\\mathrm{RR}_{10} = 1.06$ per $10\\ \\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ increase in $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a linearized expression for the expected number of avoided deaths due to a reduction in $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration, the calculation of this number, and an explanation of uncertainty propagation.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem.\nThe givens are:\n- Adult population size: $N = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$ persons.\n- Baseline all-cause mortality rate: $y_{0} = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ deaths per person per year.\n- $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction: $\\Delta C = 3.2\\ \\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$.\n- Relative risk per $10\\ \\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3}$ increase: $\\mathrm{RR}_{10} = 1.06$.\n- Log-linear model: $\\mathrm{RR}(\\Delta C) = \\exp(\\theta \\,\\Delta C)$ with $\\theta = \\ln(\\mathrm{RR}_{10})/10$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using standard models and plausible data from environmental epidemiology and health impact assessment. The terms are well-defined, and the setup is internally consistent and complete for the tasks required. It is a well-posed problem. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Avoided Deaths\n\nThe number of deaths is the product of the population size and the mortality rate. The baseline number of deaths per year is $D_0 = N y_0$. After the policy reduces the $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ concentration, the new mortality rate is $y_1$, and the new number of deaths is $D_1 = N y_1$. The number of deaths avoided per year, $\\Delta D$, is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_0 - D_1 = N (y_0 - y_1)\n$$\nThe relationship between the mortality rates $y_0$ and $y_1$ is given by the relative risk. The relative risk of the baseline concentration compared to the new, lower concentration is the ratio of the mortality rates, $y_0 / y_1$. The change in concentration from the new state to the baseline state is an increase of $\\Delta C$. Using the provided log-linear model, this relative risk is:\n$$\n\\frac{y_0}{y_1} = \\mathrm{RR}(\\Delta C) = \\exp(\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the new mortality rate $y_1$ in terms of the baseline rate $y_0$:\n$$\ny_1 = y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for avoided deaths gives the exact formula under the log-linear model:\n$$\n\\Delta D = N(y_0 - y_0 \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - \\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C))\n$$\nThe problem asks for a linearized expression, which is obtained by a first-order Taylor series approximation of the exponential term. For a small argument $x$, $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$. Here, the argument is $x = -\\theta \\Delta C$. The approximation is valid if $|\\theta \\Delta C| \\ll 1$. We can verify this condition. The parameter $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{RR}_{10})}{10} = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10} \\approx \\frac{0.05827}{10} = 0.005827\\ (\\mu \\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{m}^{3})^{-1}\n$$\nThe argument is $-\\theta \\Delta C \\approx -0.005827 \\times 3.2 \\approx -0.0186$. Since $|-0.0186| \\ll 1$, the linear approximation is well-justified.\nApplying the approximation $\\exp(-\\theta \\Delta C) \\approx 1 - \\theta \\Delta C$ to the formula for $\\Delta D$:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 (1 - (1 - \\theta \\Delta C)) = N y_0 (1 - 1 + \\theta \\Delta C)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the derived linearized exposure–response expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D \\approx N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the expected annual avoided deaths using the provided inputs:\n- $N = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}$\n- $y_0 = 7.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\Delta C = 3.2$\n- $\\theta = \\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the linearized expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2\n$$\nThe baseline number of annual deaths is $D_0 = N y_0 = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (7.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = 9000$.\n$$\n\\Delta D = 9000 \\times \\left(\\frac{\\ln(1.06)}{10}\\right) \\times 3.2 = 900 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\times 3.2\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta D = 2880 \\times \\ln(1.06) \\approx 2880 \\times 0.0582689 \\approx 167.81445...\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $168$ avoided deaths per year.\n\nPart 2: Uncertainty Propagation\n\nTo propagate uncertainty, we consider the estimate of avoided deaths, $\\Delta D$, as a function of the uncertain parameters, which are the concentration-response slope $\\theta$ and the $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction $\\Delta C$. The population $N$ and baseline mortality rate $y_0$ are treated as known constants. The linearized model is $\\Delta D(\\theta, \\Delta C) = N y_0 \\theta \\Delta C$.\n\nLet $\\mu_\\theta$ and $\\sigma_\\theta^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\theta$, and let $\\mu_{\\Delta C}$ and $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$ be the mean and variance of the estimate for $\\Delta C$. The central estimate for avoided deaths is $\\Delta \\hat{D} = N y_0 \\mu_\\theta \\mu_{\\Delta C}$.\n\nUsing a first-order Taylor series expansion (the delta method) to approximate the variance of $\\Delta D$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2 + 2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} \\right) \\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)\n$$\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the mean values, are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\theta} = N y_0 \\Delta C \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\Delta D)}{\\partial \\Delta C} = N y_0 \\theta \\implies (N y_0 \\mu_{\\theta})\n$$\nUnder the given independence assumption, the covariance term $\\mathrm{Cov}(\\theta, \\Delta C)$ is $0$. Substituting the partial derivatives into the variance formula yields:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta D) \\approx (N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2 + (N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2\n$$\nThis expression identifies the two primary components of variance in the final estimate.\n1.  The first term, $(N y_0 \\mu_{\\Delta C})^2 \\sigma_\\theta^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the scientific evidence base, specifically the concentration-response slope $\\sigma_\\theta^2$. This is often termed \"parameter uncertainty\".\n2.  The second term, $(N y_0 \\mu_\\theta)^2 \\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$, represents the contribution from the uncertainty in the projected effectiveness of the policy, $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$. This is often termed \"exposure uncertainty\".\n\nIn the context of HiAP decision-making, this decomposition is highly valuable. It distinguishes between uncertainty inherent in the current state of scientific knowledge (from $\\sigma_\\theta^2$) and uncertainty related to the specific policy's implementation and impact (from $\\sigma_{\\Delta C}^2$). If the overall uncertainty, often represented by a $95\\%$ confidence interval around $\\Delta \\hat{D}$, is large, decision-makers can use this decomposition to understand the primary driver. If exposure uncertainty is dominant, they might invest in better modeling or monitoring of the policy's impact. If parameter uncertainty is dominant, they must accept the limitations of the current science while making a decision, perhaps opting for more precautionary measures.",

The standard method for this is linear min-max normalization:\n$$v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\frac{x_{k} - \\min_{j}(x_{k}(T_j))}{\\max_{j}(x_{k}(T_j)) - \\min_{j}(x_{k}(T_j))}$$\nHere, the minimum and maximum are taken over the set of policies $\\{T1, T2, T3\\}$ for each criterion $k$.\n\n- **Criterion 1 ($\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction, $x_1$):** Values are $\\{1.2, 2.0, 1.6\\}$. $\\min(x_1) = 1.2$, $\\max(x_1) = 2.0$.\n  $v_1(T1) = (1.2 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 0$.\n  $v_1(T2) = (2.0 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 1$.\n  $v_1(T3) = (1.6 - 1.2) / (2.0 - 1.2) = 0.4 / 0.8 = 0.5$.\n\n- **Criterion 2 (Physical activity, $x_2$):** Values are $\\{35, 10, 20\\}$. $\\min(x_2) = 10$, $\\max(x_2) = 35$.\n  $v_2(T1) = (35 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 1$.\n  $v_2(T2) = (10 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 0$.\n  $v_2(T3) = (20 - 10) / (35 - 10) = 10 / 25 = 0.4$.\n\n- **Criterion 3 (Injury reduction, $x_3$):** Values are $\\{8, 5, 12\\}$. $\\min(x_3) = 5$, $\\max(x_3) = 12$.\n  $v_3(T1) = (8 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 3/7 \\approx 0.4286$.\n  $v_3(T2) = (5 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 0$.\n  $v_3(T3) = (12 - 5) / (12 - 5) = 1$.\n\n- **Criterion 4 ($\\mathrm{CO}_2$ reduction, $x_4$):** Values are $\\{110, 180, 150\\}$. $\\min(x_4) = 110$, $\\max(x_4) = 180$.\n  $v_4(T1) = (110 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 0$.\n  $v_4(T2) = (180 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 1$.\n  $v_4(T3) = (150 - 110) / (180 - 110) = 40 / 70 = 4/7 \\approx 0.5714$.\n\n- **Criterion 5 (Equity improvement, $x_5$):** Values are $\\{0.08, 0.12, 0.15\\}$. $\\min(x_5) = 0.08$, $\\max(x_5) = 0.15$.\n  $v_5(T1) = (0.08 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 0$.\n  $v_5(T2) = (0.12 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 0.04 / 0.07 = 4/7 \\approx 0.5714$.\n  $v_5(T3) = (0.15 - 0.08) / (0.15 - 0.08) = 1$.\n\n**2. Elicitation of Criterion Weights, $w_k$**\n\nThe stakeholder swing scores are given as $S_1=30$, $S_2=25$, $S_3=20$, $S_4=10$, $S_5=15$. The total score is $\\sum_k S_k = 30 + 25 + 20 + 10 + 15 = 100$. The weights $w_k$ are found by normalizing these scores to sum to $1$:\n$$w_k = \\frac{S_k}{\\sum_j S_j}$$\n- $w_1 = 30 / 100 = 0.30$ ($\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$)\n- $w_2 = 25 / 100 = 0.25$ (Physical activity)\n- $w_3 = 20 / 100 = 0.20$ (Injury reduction)\n- $w_4 = 10 / 100 = 0.10$ ($\\mathrm{CO}_2$ reduction)\n- $w_5 = 15 / 100 = 0.15$ (Equity)\n\n**3. Computation of Overall Value, $V$**\n\nThe overall value for each policy is $V(T_j) = \\sum_{k=1}^5 w_k v_k(T_j)$.\n\n- **Policy $T1$**:\n$V(T1) = w_1 v_1(T1) + w_2 v_2(T1) + w_3 v_3(T1) + w_4 v_4(T1) + w_5 v_5(T1)$\n$V(T1) = (0.30)(0) + (0.25)(1) + (0.20)(3/7) + (0.10)(0) + (0.15)(0)$\n$V(T1) = 0 + 0.25 + 0.6/7 \\approx 0.25 + 0.08571 = 0.33571... \\approx 0.336$\n\n- **Policy $T2$**:\n$V(T2) = w_1 v_1(T2) + w_2 v_2(T2) + w_3 v_3(T2) + w_4 v_4(T2) + w_5 v_5(T2)$\n$V(T2) = (0.30)(1) + (0.25)(0) + (0.20)(0) + (0.10)(1) + (0.15)(4/7)$\n$V(T2) = 0.30 + 0 + 0 + 0.10 + 0.6/7 \\approx 0.40 + 0.08571 = 0.48571... \\approx 0.486$\n\n- **Policy $T3$**:\n$V(T3) = w_1 v_1(T3) + w_2 v_2(T3) + w_3 v_3(T3) + w_4 v_4(T3) + w_5 v_5(T3)$\n$V(T3) = (0.30)(0.5) + (0.25)(0.4) + (0.20)(1) + (0.10)(4/7) + (0.15)(1)$\n$V(T3) = 0.15 + 0.10 + 0.20 + 0.4/7 + 0.15$\n$V(T3) = 0.60 + 4/70 \\approx 0.60 + 0.05714 = 0.65714... \\approx 0.657$\n\n**Ranking of Policies**:\nBased on the overall values, $V(T3) > V(T2) > V(T1)$. The ranking is $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$.\n\n**4. Alignment with HiAP Principles**\nThe process described aligns with the Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach by:\n- **Intersectoral Collaboration**: Involving a panel with representatives from public health, transport, environment, urban planning, and the community.\n- **Evidence-Informed and Transparent Decision-Making**: Using a formal, quantitative method (MCDA) that makes trade-offs explicit through weights and documents the evidence (outcome data).\n- **Health Equity as a Goal**: Explicitly including an equity criterion and assigning it a significant weight, thus integrating equity considerations directly into the decision.\n- **Co-benefits**: The framework is explicitly designed to evaluate multiple co-benefits (air quality, physical activity, safety, climate, equity) simultaneously.\n- **Accountability**: The structured process creates a traceable record of how the decision was made. The problem's mention of ex-ante and ex-post evaluation reinforces this.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Use min–max normalization $v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\dfrac{x_{k} - \\min(x_{k})}{\\max(x_{k}) - \\min(x_{k})}$ computed over $\\{T1,T2,T3\\}$ for each criterion; compute weights by normalizing the swing scores to $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$. Then $V(T1) \\approx 0.336$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.486$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.657$, giving $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement includes an intersectoral panel (health, transport, environment, planning) plus community representatives, explicit equity consideration via a criterion and its weight, transparent documentation, and plans for ex-ante and ex-post evaluation.**\n- This option correctly identifies min-max normalization as the appropriate method.\n- It correctly normalizes the swing scores to obtain the weights $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$.\n- It correctly computes the overall values $V(T1) \\approx 0.336$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.486$, and $V(T3) \\approx 0.657$.\n- It correctly determines the ranking $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$.\n- Its description of stakeholder involvement and governance is fully consistent with HiAP principles and the details provided in the problem.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use ratio-to-maximum normalization $v_{k}(x_{k}) = \\dfrac{x_{k}}{\\max(x_{k})}$ for all criteria; assign equal weights $w_{k} = 0.20$; compute $V(T1) \\approx 0.682$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.701$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.841$, ranking $T3 \\succ T2 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement is limited to transport and finance agencies to streamline decisions, with no public health or community participation.**\n- The choice of ratio-to-maximum normalization is less consistent with the swing weighting setup, which focuses on the range from worst to best.\n- Assigning equal weights ($w_k=0.20$) is incorrect; it ignores the explicit stakeholder swing scores provided.\n- The description of stakeholder involvement directly contradicts the problem statement and the core tenets of HiAP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use min–max normalization but set weights directly equal to the swing scores $w = (30, 25, 20, 10, 15)$ without normalization; compute $V(T1) \\approx 33.6$, $V(T2) \\approx 48.6$, $V(T3) \\approx 65.7$ and declare $T2$ best because it has the largest single-criterion performance on $\\mathrm{PM}_{2.5}$ reduction; stakeholder involvement includes public health and transport only.**\n- Setting weights equal to raw scores is incorrect; the model requires weights that sum to $1$.\n- Declaring $T2$ as the winner based on a single criterion violates the fundamental purpose of MCDA, which is to aggregate across all criteria according to their respective importance.\n- The description of stakeholder involvement is an incorrect simplification of the panel described in the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Use min–max normalization for most criteria but invert injury reduction so $v_{3}(x_{3}) = 1 - \\dfrac{x_{3} - \\min(x_{3})}{\\max(x_{3}) - \\min(x_{3})}$; normalize weights to $w = (0.30, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.15)$; compute $V(T1) \\approx 0.249$, $V(T2) \\approx 0.571$, $V(T3) \\approx 0.512$, ranking $T2 \\succ T3 \\succ T1$. Stakeholder involvement emphasizes transparency but drops the equity criterion to avoid “politicization.”**\n- The inversion of the value function for injury reduction is incorrect. The problem states that all criteria are oriented so \"larger values are better,\" meaning $v_k(x_k)$ must be an increasing function of $x_k$. Inverting the function violates this requirement.\n- Dropping the equity criterion contradicts the problem data and violates a key principle of the HiAP approach.\n- The computed V values are incorrect, even under the flawed assumption of an inverted value function.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
