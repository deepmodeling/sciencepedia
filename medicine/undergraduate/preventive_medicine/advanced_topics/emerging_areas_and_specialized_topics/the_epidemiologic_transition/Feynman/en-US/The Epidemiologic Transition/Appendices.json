The ASMR allows for a fair comparison of underlying mortality risk by controlling for differences in the age composition of the populations.

The crude absolute difference is $|207.26 - 66.0| = 141.26$.\nThe age-standardized mortality rates are $ASMR_Y = 99.9$ and $ASMR_O = 144.87$. The standardized absolute difference is $44.97$.\n\nThe comparison reveals a significant discrepancy. The crude rate comparison suggests that the mortality burden from IHD in Country O is vastly greater than in Country Y. However, the age-standardized comparison shows a much smaller, though still substantial, difference. This disparity is a direct consequence of confounding by age structure. Country O is an \"older\" country, with a larger proportion of its population in the higher age groups where IHD mortality is extremely high (e.g., $18\\%$ of the population is $\\geq 65$, where the rate is $800$ per $100,000$). This amplifies its crude rate. Conversely, Country Y is a \"younger\" country, with a larger proportion of its population in low-mortality age groups (e.g., $32\\%$ is $0-14$, where the rate is $5$ per $100,000$). This depresses its crude rate.\n\nAge-standardization removes this confounding effect by calculating the rate that would be observed if both countries had the same (standard) age structure. The resulting ASMRs provide a more accurate measure of the underlying difference in mortality risk between the two populations, attributable to factors other than age distribution (e.g., lifestyle, healthcare access, genetics). In the context of the epidemiologic transition, as a country ages (like Country O), its crude mortality rate from noncommunicable diseases like IHD will rise dramatically simply due to demographic shifts, even if its age-specific risks remain constant. This makes direct standardization essential for tracking true changes in disease risk over time or between populations at different stages of the transition.",
