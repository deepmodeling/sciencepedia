            "problem": "In wastewater-based epidemiology, concentrations of target nucleic acids are often quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), where the cycle threshold $C_t$ is measured for serial dilutions to construct a standard curve. Consider a standard curve described by $C_t = a - b \\log_{10}(N)$, where $N$ is the initial copy number and $b$ is the positive slope. A trained analyst obtains an estimate $b = 3.4 \\pm 0.1$ (one standard uncertainty) from a linear fit.\n\nStarting from the definition that each qPCR cycle multiplies the target quantity by a constant cycle efficiency factor $(1+E)$, and that the fluorescence threshold is crossed when $T = N (1+E)^{C_t}$ for a fixed threshold $T$, do the following:\n\n1. Using only these base definitions and logarithm laws, derive an expression for the slope $b$ in terms of the amplification efficiency $E$.\n\n2.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Standard curve equation: $C_t = a - b \\log_{10}(N)$\n- $C_t$: cycle threshold\n- $N$: initial copy number\n- $b$: a positive parameter, given as $b = 3.4 \\pm 0.1$ (one standard uncertainty, $\\sigma_b = 0.1$)\n- Amplification equation: $T = N (1+E)^{C_t}$\n- $T$: fixed fluorescence threshold\n- $E$: cycle amplification efficiency\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the fundamental principles of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The exponential amplification model $T = N (1+E)^{C_t}$ and the resulting log-linear standard curve $C_t = a - b \\log_{10}(N)$ are standard and correct representations used in molecular diagnostics and epidemiology. The numerical value provided for the parameter $b$ is realistic for typical qPCR experiments.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with distinct, sequential tasks: derivation of relationships between variables, uncertainty propagation, and numerical evaluation. All necessary equations and data are provided.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Flaw Check**: The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and presents a non-trivial, verifiable task. The statement that \"$b$ is the positive slope\" is a common, though slightly imprecise, convention in the field; the slope of $C_t$ vs. $\\log_{10}(N)$ is actually $-b$, so this implies $b > 0$, which is consistent with the physics of the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $b$ in terms of $E$**\nWe start from the base definition of amplification reaching a fixed threshold $T$:\n$$T = N (1+E)^{C_t}$$\nTo relate this to the standard curve equation, we must isolate $C_t$. We take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\log_{10}(T) = \\log_{10}\\left(N (1+E)^{C_t}\\right)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$, this becomes:\n$$\\log_{10}(T) = \\log_{10}(N) + \\log_{10}\\left((1+E)^{C_t}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\log(x^p) = p \\log(x)$, we have:\n$$\\log_{10}(T) = \\log_{10}(N) + C_t \\log_{10}(1+E)$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $C_t$:\n$$C_t \\log_{10}(1+E) = \\log_{10}(T) - \\log_{10}(N)$$\n$$C_t = \\frac{\\log_{10}(T)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)} - \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)} \\log_{10}(N)$$\nThis derived equation has the linear form $y = m x + c$, where $y=C_t$ and $x=\\log_{10}(N)$. We compare it to the given standard curve equation, $C_t = a - b \\log_{10}(N)$. By matching the terms, we can identify the intercept $a$ and the parameter $b$.\nThe intercept is $a = \\frac{\\log_{10}(T)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$.\nThe coefficient of the $\\log_{10}(N)$ term gives us the relationship for $b$:\n$$-b = - \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\nTherefore, the expression for $b$ in terms of $E$ is:\n$$b = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\n\n**Part 2: Inversion to obtain $E$ as a function of $b$**\nWe start with the result from Part 1 and algebraically solve for $E$:\n$$b = \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)}$$\n$$\\log_{10}(1+E) = \\frac{1}{b}$$\nTo eliminate the logarithm, we use the definition of the base-$10$ logarithm, which means we raise $10$ to the power of both sides:\n$$10^{\\log_{10}(1+E)} = 10^{1/b}$$\n$$1+E = 10^{1/b}$$\nFinally, isolating $E$ gives:\n$$E = 10^{1/b} - 1$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the standard uncertainty of $E$**\nWe use first-order Gaussian error propagation to find the standard uncertainty in $E$, denoted $\\sigma_E$, resulting from the standard uncertainty in $b$, denoted $\\sigma_b$. The formula is:\n$$\\sigma_E \\approx \\left| \\frac{dE}{db} \\right| \\sigma_b$$\nWe must compute the derivative of $E$ with respect to $b$:\n$$E(b) = 10^{1/b} - 1 = 10^{b^{-1}} - 1$$\nUsing the chain rule, and recalling that the derivative of $k^u$ is $k^u \\ln(k)$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{db} = \\frac{d}{db}(10^{b^{-1}}) - \\frac{d}{db}(1)$$\n$$\\frac{dE}{db} = \\left( 10^{b^{-1}} \\ln(10) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{d}{db}(b^{-1})$$\nThe derivative of $b^{-1}$ is $-1 \\cdot b^{-2} = - \\frac{1}{b^2}$. Substituting this back, we get:\n$$\\frac{dE}{db} = \\left( 10^{1/b} \\ln(10) \\right) \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{1}{b^2} \\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{1/b}}{b^2}$$\nSince all terms ($b^2$, $10^{1/b}$, $\\ln(10)$) are positive, the absolute value is:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dE}{db} \\right| = \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{1/b}}{b^2}$$\nThus, the expression for the standard uncertainty of $E$ is:\n$$\\sigma_E = \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{1/b}}{b^2} \\sigma_b$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given $b = 3.4$ and $\\sigma_b = 0.1$. We now substitute these values into the expressions for $E$ and $\\sigma_E$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amplification efficiency $E$:\n$$E = 10^{1/3.4} - 1 \\approx 10^{0.2941176} - 1 \\approx 1.96845 - 1 = 0.96845$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $E \\approx 0.968$.\n\nNext, we calculate the standard uncertainty $\\sigma_E$:\n$$\\sigma_E = \\frac{\\ln(10) \\cdot 10^{1/3.4}}{(3.4)^2} (0.1)$$\nUsing the intermediate value $10^{1/3.4} \\approx 1.96845$, and $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$, and $(3.4)^2=11.56$:\n$$\\sigma_E \\approx \\frac{(2.302585) \\cdot (1.96845)}{11.56} \\cdot (0.1)$$\n$$\\sigma_E \\approx \\frac{4.5323}{11.56} \\cdot (0.1) \\approx (0.392069) \\cdot (0.1) \\approx 0.0392069$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, we get $\\sigma_E \\approx 0.0392$.\n\n**Implications for Low-Copy Quantification**\nThe calculated efficiency $E = 0.968$ corresponds to a reaction efficiency of $96.8\\%$. This is a high value, close to the theoretical maximum of $100\\%$ ($E=1$), which is indicative of a well-optimized qPCR assay. High efficiency is crucial for sensitive detection, especially of low-concentration targets common in wastewater.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty of $\\sigma_E = 0.0392$ (or approximately $3.9\\%$) has significant implications. Because amplification is an exponential process over approximately $20$ to $40$ cycles, even a small uncertainty in the single-cycle efficiency compounds into a large uncertainty in the final result. Wastewater is a complex sample matrix that often contains PCR inhibitors (e.g., humic acids, salts), which can lower the amplification efficiency $E$ in a variable, sample-dependent manner. The determined uncertainty $\\sigma_E$ reflects the precision of the standard curve under controlled conditions, but does not account for this additional sample-to-sample variability. For low-copy quantification, where $C_t$ values are high, the impact of efficiency variations is magnified. This makes it challenging to achieve high precision when estimating the initial copy number $N$. The logarithmic relationship between $N$ and $C_t$ means that a moderate uncertainty in the slope parameter $b$ (and thus in $E$) translates into a substantial relative uncertainty in the calculated concentration $N$, compromising the reliability of quantitative estimates at the detection limit.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of wastewater-based epidemiology and environmental engineering, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objective in its formulation. All necessary parameters, models for uncertainty, and assumptions are provided to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the four tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nTask 1: Derive the estimator $\\hat{N}$ for the contributing population.\nThe derivation begins with a mass balance on ammonium nitrogen in the sewershed. The total observed mass load of ammonium nitrogen over a $24$-hour period, denoted $M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the product of the average wastewater flow rate, $Q$, and the average concentration, $C$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q \\times C$$\nThe units must be consistent. Given $Q$ in m$^3$/day and $C$ in mg N/L, we use the provided conversion $1$ mg/L $= 1$ g/m$^3$.\n$$C \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\right] = C \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} \\right]$$\nThus, the load is in g/day:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{day}} \\right] = Q \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{m}^3}{\\mathrm{day}} \\right] \\times C \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{m}^3} \\right]$$\nThis total observed load, $M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the sum of the load from human sources, $M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}}$, and the load from non-human (industrial) sources, $M_{\\mathrm{ind}}$. The problem states that the non-human contribution is a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ of the total observed load.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{ind}} = f_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\times M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$$\nTherefore, the observed load from human sources is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = M_{\\mathrm{obs}} - M_{\\mathrm{ind}} = M_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})$$\nThe problem also specifies that the ammonium nitrogen from human sources undergoes in-sewer biogeochemical loss, modeled by a fractional loss $L$. Let $M_{\\mathrm{human, source}}$ be the total mass of ammonium nitrogen excreted by the population at the source. The observed human load is the source load attenuated by this fractional loss.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = M_{\\mathrm{human, source}}(1 - L)$$\nThe total source human load is the product of the contributing population size, $N$, and the per-capita excretion rate, $E$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, source}} = N \\times E$$\nBy combining these equations, we can establish a relationship between the observed quantities and the population $N$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = (N \\times E)(1 - L)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}}$ in terms of $M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) = N \\times E \\times (1 - L)$$\nFinally, substituting $M_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q C$:\n$$Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) = N E (1 - L)$$\nSolving for the population estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\\hat{N} = \\frac{Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})}{E (1 - L)}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the estimator of the contributing population.\n\nTask 2: Derive an expression for $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}]$.\nTo analyze the propagation of uncertainty, we first take the natural logarithm of the estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\\ln \\hat{N} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})}{E (1 - L)} \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expression expands to:\n$$\\ln \\hat{N} = \\ln Q + \\ln C + \\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) - \\ln E - \\ln(1 - L)$$\nThe problem states that all sources of uncertainty are independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln Q] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln C] + \\mathrm{Var}[-\\ln E] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})] + \\mathrm{Var}[-\\ln(1 - L)]$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}[-X] = (-1)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mathrm{Var}[X]$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln Q] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln C] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln E] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - L)]$$\nWe now evaluate each variance term based on the given uncertainty models.\nFor a variable $X$ with a small relative standard deviation $\\sigma_{X, \\mathrm{rel}}$, the variance of its natural logarithm can be approximated as $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln X] \\approx (\\sigma_{X, \\mathrm{rel}})^2$. This applies to $Q$ and $C$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln Q] \\approx (\\sigma_{Q, \\mathrm{rel}})^2$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln C] \\approx (\\sigma_{C, \\mathrm{rel}})^2$$\nFor the per-capita excretion rate $E$, which is lognormally distributed with geometric standard deviation $\\mathrm{GSD}_E$, its natural logarithm $\\ln E$ is normally distributed. The standard deviation of $\\ln E$ is $\\sigma_{\\ln E} = \\ln(\\mathrm{GSD}_E)$. Therefore, the variance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln E] = (\\sigma_{\\ln E})^2 = (\\ln(\\mathrm{GSD}_E))^2$$\nFor the terms involving $f_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ and $L$, we use a first-order Taylor series approximation for the variance of a function of a random variable.

The main goal is to compute $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}]$ and then the CV.

The daily influent flow is\n$$\nQ = N \\times w = 120{,}000 \\times 150 = 18{,}000{,}000 \\text{ L/day}.\n$$\nThe total daily viral load entering the sewer from infected individuals is\n$$\nL = p \\times N \\times S = p \\times 120{,}000 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{7} = 6.0 \\times 10^{12} \\times p \\text{ copies/day}.\n$$\nDuring transit, first-order decay reduces this load by the survival factor $\\exp(-k \\tau_{d})$, with\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{0.75} \\text{ day}^{-1}, \\quad \\tau_{d} = \\frac{\\tau}{24} = \\frac{8}{24} = \\frac{1}{3} \\text{ day}.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nk \\tau_{d} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{0.75} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{\\ln 2}{2.25} \\approx 0.308065,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\exp(-k \\tau_{d}) \\approx \\exp(-0.308065) \\approx 0.7349.\n$$\nIn addition, the analytical recovery fraction is $r = 0.35$. Therefore, the expected true influent concentration $C$ (in copies/L) at the sampling point is obtained by mass balance:\n$$\nC = \\frac{L \\times r \\times \\exp(-k \\tau_{d})}{Q} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{12} \\times p) \\times 0.35 \\times 0.7349}{18{,}000{,}000}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p = p_{\\min} = 0.003$ gives\n$$\nL = 6.0 \\times 10^{12} \\times 0.003 = 1.8 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ copies/day},\n$$\nso\n$$\nL \\times r \\times \\exp(-k \\tau_{d}) \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^{10} \\times 0.35 \\times 0.7349 \\approx 4.6299 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ copies/day}.\n$$\nDividing by $Q = 1.8 \\times 10^{7}$ L/day yields\n$$\nC \\approx \\frac{4.6299 \\times 10^{9}}{1.8 \\times 10^{7}} \\approx 257.22 \\text{ copies/L}.\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the one-sample detection probability under lognormal measurement error. Let $\\log_{10}(\\text{measured}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\log_{10}(C), \\sigma_{10}^{2})$ with $\\sigma_{10} = 0.50$. A single grab sample is positive if the measured concentration is at least $\\mathrm{LOD} = 300$ copies/L. Therefore, the one-sample detection probability $p_{1}$ is\n$$\np_{1} = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\log_{10}(\\text{measured}) \\geq \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{LOD})\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\!\\left( \\frac{\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{LOD}) - \\log_{10}(C)}{\\sigma_{10}} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. Compute the logarithms:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(C) \\approx \\log_{10}(257.22) \\approx 2.4103, \\quad \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{LOD}) = \\log_{10}(300) \\approx 2.4771.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nz = \\frac{2.4771 - 2.4103}{0.50} = \\frac{0.0668}{0.50} = 0.1336,\n$$\nand\n$$\np_{1} \\approx 1 - \\Phi(0.1336).\n$$\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, $\\Phi(0.1336) \\approx 0.5531$, hence\n$$\np_{1} \\approx 1 - 0.5531 = 0.4469.\n$$\n\nWith $n$ independent samples in a week, the probability of at least one detection is\n$$\nP_{\\text{week}}(n) = 1 - (1 - p_{1})^{n}.\n$$\nWe require $P_{\\text{week}}(n) \\geq 0.95$, which is equivalent to\n$$\n(1 - p_{1})^{n} \\leq 0.05 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad n \\geq \\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\ln(1 - p_{1})}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p_{1} \\approx 0.4469$ gives\n$$\n\\ln(1 - p_{1}) = \\ln(0.5531) \\approx -0.5922, \\quad \\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.9957,\n$$\nso\n$$\nn \\geq \\frac{-2.9957}{-0.5922} \\approx 5.059.\n$$\nThe minimal integer number of samples per week is the ceiling,\n$$\nn^{\\ast} = 6.\n$$\n\nTherefore, under the specified sentinel site and noise parameters, $n^{\\ast} = 6$ evenly spaced grab samples per week are required to achieve at least $0.95$ probability of detecting at least one positive sample when the true prevalence equals $p_{\\min} = 0.003$.",
