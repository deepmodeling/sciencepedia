Assume continuous time discounting at a constant instantaneous discount rate $r=0.03$ per year, and measure time $t$ in years from treatment initiation at $t=0$.

The calculation must account for a piecewise constant utility function and continuous time discounting.\n\nThe foundational definition of present-discounted QALYs is given by the integral of the utility function $U(t)$, weighted by a continuous discount factor $e^{-rt}$, over the specified time period. The quantity $r$ is the constant instantaneous discount rate, and $t$ is time.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given information. Time $t$ is measured in years, starting from $t=0$ at the initiation of treatment. The discount rate is given as $r=0.03$ per year.\n\nThe utility function, $U(t)$, is piecewise constant. We must convert the time intervals from months to years.\n1.  For the first $6$ months, which is $6/12 = 0.5$ years, the utility is $0.6$. So, for $t \\in [0, 0.5]$, $U(t) = 0.6$.\n2.  For the subsequent $18$ months, which is $18/12 = 1.5$ years, the utility is $0.8$. This period starts after the first $0.5$ years and lasts for $1.5$ years, so it covers the time interval $t \\in (0.5, 0.5+1.5] = (0.5, 2.0]$. For this interval, $U(t) = 0.8$.\n\nThe total period of analysis is $24$ months, which is $2$ years. The total present-discounted QALYs are calculated by integrating the discounted utility flow from $t=0$ to $t=2$:\n$$ \\text{QALYs} = \\int_{0}^{2} U(t) e^{-rt} dt $$\nGiven that $U(t)$ is a piecewise function, we must split the integral into two parts corresponding to the two time intervals:\n$$ \\text{QALYs} = \\int_{0}^{0.5} 0.6 \\cdot e^{-0.03t} dt + \\int_{0.5}^{2} 0.8 \\cdot e^{-0.03t} dt $$\nWe evaluate each integral separately.

We are given the incremental cost, $\\Delta C$, and the incremental effectiveness, $\\Delta E$, of a new therapy compared to a standard of care.\n\n1.  **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)**\n    The ICER is a primary metric in cost-effectiveness analysis. It represents the additional cost per unit of additional health outcome gained. By its fundamental definition, it is the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effectiveness.\n    \n    The expression for the ICER is:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E}\n    $$\n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    \n    The numerical value of the ICER is calculated as:\n    $$\n    ICER = \\frac{12000}{0.4} = \\frac{120000}{4} = 30000\n    $$\n    The units of the ICER are dollars per QALY, or $\\$30,000/\\text{QALY}$.\n\n2.  **Net Monetary Benefit (NMB)**\n    The NMB is an alternative metric that quantifies the value of an intervention in monetary terms. It is derived by first monetizing the incremental health gain using the societal willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda$, and then subtracting the incremental cost. The value $\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E$ represents the monetary worth of the health gain, and $\\Delta C$ is its cost. The net benefit is the difference.\n    \n    The expression for the NMB is:\n    $$\n    NMB = (\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C\n    $$\n    An intervention is considered cost-effective if its NMB is positive ($NMB > 0$), meaning the monetized value of the health gain exceeds the cost.\n    \n    Using the provided numerical values:\n    $\\lambda = 30000$ (in dollars per QALY)\n    $\\Delta E = 0.4$ (in QALYs)\n    $\\Delta C = 12000$ (in dollars)\n    \n    The numerical value of the NMB is calculated as:\n    $$\n    NMB = (30000 \\cdot 0.4) - 12000 = 12000 - 12000 = 0\n    $$\n    The unit of the NMB is dollars ($\\$$). An NMB of $0$ indicates that the monetized health gain is exactly equal to the cost of the intervention.\n\n3.  **Decision Indicator (D)**\n    The decision indicator $D$ is to be formalized based on the NMB and the specified decision rules. The intervention is:\n    - Cost-effective if $NMB > 0$.\n    - Indifferent if $NMB = 0$.\n    - Not cost-effective if $NMB  0$.\n    \n    The indicator $D$ is defined with the values $1$, $0$, and $-1$ corresponding to these three cases. This structure mathematically corresponds to the signum function, denoted $\\text{sgn}(x)$, which extracts the sign of a real number.\n    \n    Therefore, the decision indicator $D$ can be formalized as:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(NMB) = \\text{sgn}((\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta E) - \\Delta C)\n    $$\n    where the signum function is defined as:\n    $$\n    \\text{sgn}(x) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x > 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ -1  \\text{if } x  0 \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    We have already calculated that $NMB = 0$. Therefore, the value of the decision indicator is:\n    $$\n    D = \\text{sgn}(0) = 0\n    $$\n    A value of $D=0$ signifies that the therapy is exactly on the cusp of cost-effectiveness at the given willingness-to-pay threshold.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to select between two public health programs, Program M and Program F, for which the health outcomes are considered equivalent. Let the effectiveness (QALYs gained) of the programs be $E_M$ and $E_F$, and their costs per enrollee be $C_M$ and $C_F$, respectively.\n\nWe are given that the programs are equally effective, which we formalize as:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_F - E_M = 0 $$\nThe costs per enrollee are given as $C_M = \\$63.50$ and $C_F = \\$67.50$. The difference in cost is:\n$$ \\Delta C = C_F - C_M = \\$67.50 - \\$63.50 = \\$4.00 $$\nThe standard tool for comparing two interventions is the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), defined as:\n$$ ICER = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_F - C_M}{E_F - E_M} $$\nAs correctly noted in the problem statement, when $\\Delta E = 0$ and $\\Delta C \\neq 0$, the $ICER$ is undefined (division by zero). Therefore, a different decision rule is necessary.\n\nIn the framework of cost-effectiveness analysis, when two or more alternatives are demonstrated to produce equivalent health outcomes ($\\Delta E = 0$), the analysis simplifies to a **Cost-Minimization Analysis (CMA)**. The decision rule for CMA is straightforward: select the alternative with the lowest total cost.\n\nIn this case, we compare the total cost per enrollee:\n$$ C_M = \\$63.50 $$\n$$ C_F = \\$67.50 $$\nSince $C_M  C_F$, Program M is the more efficient choice. It achieves the same health outcome as Program F but at a lower cost. Over the planned enrollment of $N = 100{,}000$ adults, choosing Program M over Program F would result in a total cost saving of:\n$$ \\text{Total Savings} = N \\times (C_F - C_M) = 100{,}000 \\times \\$4.00 = \\$400{,}000 $$\nThis saving represents an opportunity cost; the funds could be reallocated to other health-promoting activities.\n\nTherefore, the appropriate decision rule is cost-minimization, and its application leads to the selection of Program M.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. When $\\Delta E = 0$, adopt a cost-minimization decision rule: among alternatives with equal health outcomes, select the one with the lowest expected total cost per enrollee; therefore choose Program M at $\\$63.50$ over Program F at $\\$67.50$. If costs were equal, use secondary implementation considerations to break the tie.**\nThis option correctly identifies cost-minimization as the appropriate decision rule when health outcomes are equivalent. It correctly compares the total per-enrollee costs ($C_M = \\$63.50$ and $C_F = \\$67.50$) and correctly concludes that Program M should be chosen because it is less expensive. The mention of using secondary criteria (like feasibility or provider preference) as a tie-breaker is also a standard and sound practice in health economic evaluation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Compute an average cost per QALY for each program and pick the program with the lower ratio; since both have equal QALY gains, select Program F because higher overhead implies more reliable administration even if per-enrollee cost is higher.**\nThis option proposes using the Average Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ($ACER = C/E$). For two mutually exclusive programs, the ICER is the standard comparative tool, not the ACER. However, even if we were to use the ACER, let the equal QALY gain be $E_{gain} > 0$. The ACERs would be $ACER_M = C_M / E_{gain}$ and $ACER_F = C_F / E_{gain}$. Since $C_M  C_F$, it follows that $ACER_M  ACER_F$. This rule would lead to selecting Program M, not Program F. The reasoning provided for choosing Program F—that \"higher overhead implies more reliable administration\"—is a subjective, unsupported assertion not based on the data provided.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Use a net monetary benefit approach with willingness-to-pay $\\lambda = \\$50{,}000$ per QALY; since $\\Delta E = 0$, calculate $\\Delta E \\cdot \\lambda - \\Delta C$ and choose the program with the greater cost because higher cost makes the net monetary benefit larger when effects are equal.**\nThe Net Monetary Benefit (NMB) framework is a valid alternative to ICER. The incremental NMB of switching from Program M to Program F is $INMB_{F \\text{ vs } M} = (\\Delta E \\cdot \\lambda) - \\Delta C$. Given $\\Delta E = 0$ and a willingness-to-pay of $\\lambda = \\$50{,}000$ per QALY, the calculation is:\n$$ INMB = (0 \\cdot \\$50{,}000) - (\\$67.50 - \\$63.50) = \\$0 - \\$4.00 = -\\$4.00 $$\nA negative INMB indicates that the new program (Program F) is not cost-effective compared to the current one (Program M). The decision rule is to choose the program that maximizes NMB, which in this case means sticking with Program M. The option's claim that one should \"choose the program with the greater cost\" because it \"makes the net monetary benefit larger\" is the opposite of the truth. A higher cost (positive $\\Delta C$) reduces the INMB when effects are equal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because the incremental ratio cannot be computed when $\\Delta E = 0$, defer the economic decision and choose based on clinical preference, ignoring costs, since equal effectiveness implies economics is irrelevant.**\nThis position is fundamentally at odds with the principles of health economics and responsible resource allocation. Equal effectiveness does not make economics irrelevant; on the contrary, it simplifies the economic decision to one of pure cost comparison. Ignoring a cost difference of $\\$400{,}000$ for a program with equivalent health outcomes is fiscally irresponsible and represents a significant opportunity cost. The economic aspect is highly relevant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Apply cost-minimization but exclude overhead as a non-incremental fixed cost; compare variable costs only ($\\$60.50$ for Program M versus $\\$57.50$ for Program F), and choose Program F as the lower-cost option under this adjusted comparison.**\nThis option correctly suggests cost-minimization but incorrectly re-categorizes a stated variable cost as a fixed cost. The problem explicitly defines overhead as a \"per-enrollee\" cost (Program M: $\\$3$, Program F: $\\$10$). This means the total overhead is directly proportional to the number of people enrolled, making it a variable or marginal cost, not a fixed cost. A fixed cost would not change with the number of enrollees. All costs listed are explicitly part of the marginal cost of enrolling an additional person and must be included in the comparison. The option's calculation is based on this false premise:\n*   Adjusted Cost M: $\\$63.50 - \\$3 = \\$60.50$\n*   Adjusted Cost F: $\\$67.50 - \\$10 = \\$57.50$\nThis leads to the erroneous conclusion that Program F is the lower-cost option. The correct approach is to include all per-enrollee costs.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
