            "problem": "A district health authority is planning the community health workforce needed to deliver preventive services. A national guideline recommends a coverage ratio of $1$ community health worker per $1{,}000$ people ($1:1{,}000$). The district population is $350{,}000$. Planning is based on the following core definitions and well-tested workforce concepts: the coverage ratio defines the target number of full-time equivalent community health workers needed, the Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) is the fraction of full-time workload a single worker provides (e.g., $1.0$ for full-time, $0.5$ for half-time), and the attrition rate is the fraction of workers who leave or are otherwise unavailable during the planning horizon, reducing the effective workforce.\n\nUsing these foundations, determine the required number of individual community health workers to meet the coverage target under four scenarios:\n1. Baseline: no attrition and all workers at $1.0$ FTE.\n2. Attrition only: an attrition rate of $10\\%$ with all workers at $1.0$ FTE.\n3. Part-time only: no attrition, but all workers at $0.5$ FTE.\n4. Combined: an attrition rate of $10\\%$ with all workers at $0.5$ FTE.\n\nYou must derive your calculations from first principles starting from the definitions above, not by quoting any pre-derived workforce formula. Round each final headcount to three significant figures. Express your final answer as a single row matrix in the order (baseline, attrition only, part-time only, combined), and report the headcounts as pure numbers without units in the final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The coverage ratio of $1$ community health worker per $1{,}000$ people implies that the target number of full-time equivalent (FTE) community health workers required, denoted by $T$, is the population divided by $1{,}000$. Let the district population be $P$.

Let $H$ be the headcount, $f$ be the FTE contribution per worker, and $s$ be the retention fraction (the fraction of workers remaining available during the planning horizon). If attrition is $a$ (expressed as a fraction), then $s = 1 - a$. The effective supplied FTEs are the product of headcount, FTE per worker, and retention:\n$$\n\\text{effective FTE supply} \\;=\\; H \\times f \\times s.\n$$\nTo meet the target $T$, the effective FTE supply must equal $T$, therefore\n$$\nH \\times f \\times s \\;=\\; T \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad H \\;=\\; \\frac{T}{f\\,s}.\n$$\n\nWe now evaluate $H$ for each scenario:\n\n1.

This practice introduces the concept of \"Effective Coverage,\" a crucial metric for evaluating a health program's true impact on population health.

In the health systems framework, coverage is defined as the proportion of individuals in need who receive the appropriate service, and quality-adjusted success is defined as the probability that an individual who received the service achieves the intended health outcome. For hypertension control, let $C$ denote the proportion of adults with hypertension who receive guideline-concordant antihypertensive care, and let $Q$ denote the probability that an adult who received such care achieves controlled blood pressure within the monitoring period, reflecting clinical quality.\n\nStarting from the foundational probability identity that the joint probability of two events equals the probability of one event times the conditional probability of the second event given the first, and the health systems definition that Effective Coverage (EC) is the probability that an individual in need both receives appropriate care and achieves the intended health outcome in the relevant period, derive an expression for $EC$ in terms of $C$ and $Q$. Then compute the numerical value of $EC$ given $C = 0.7$ and $Q = 0.6$.

Therefore, $P(A) = C$.\n- The quality, $Q$, is the probability that an individual who received care achieves the desired outcome. This is the conditional probability of event $B$ given event $A$. Therefore, $P(B|A) = Q$.\n\nEffective Coverage ($EC$) is defined as the probability that an individual in need both receives appropriate care and achieves the intended health outcome. This corresponds to the joint probability of events $A$ and $B$, so $EC = P(A \\cap B)$.\n\nThe problem states we should use the fundamental probability identity for joint probability, which connects it to conditional probability:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A) \\times P(A)$$\nBy substituting our problem-specific variables into this identity, we derive the expression for Effective Coverage:\n$$EC = Q \\times C$$\nThis shows that effective coverage is the product of coverage and quality.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $EC$ using the given data: $C = 0.7$ and $Q = 0.6$.\n$$EC = 0.6 \\times 0.7 = 0.42$$\nFinally, we interpret this result.

Derivation of the Selection Rule**\n\nTo maximize health gains from a limited budget, we must prioritize the most efficient interventions. The efficiency of an intervention is measured by how much health it buys per dollar spent, which is the inverse of its Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), where $ICER_i = \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{\\Delta Q_i}$. Therefore, interventions with lower ICERs are more efficient.\n\nHowever, we must also consider the opportunity cost, represented by the threshold $k$. The health system should only fund a new intervention if it is more efficient than the services it would displace at the margin. An intervention provides a positive Net Health Benefit only if it generates more health than the health foregone by its cost. The health foregone is $\\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k}$. Thus, we require:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_i > \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{k} \\implies k > \\frac{\\Delta C_i}{\\Delta Q_i} \\implies ICER_i  k\n$$\nAny intervention with an $ICER_i \\ge k$ is not cost-effective and should be excluded.\n\nThe optimal selection strategy is therefore:\n1. Calculate the ICER for all candidate interventions.\n2. Exclude all interventions that are not cost-effective (i.e., where $ICER_i \\ge k$).\n3. Rank the remaining, cost-effective interventions in increasing order of their ICER (from most to least efficient).\n4.
