The concepts of pretest probability, sensitivity, and specificity are fundamental to epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The provided numerical values are realistic for a modern diagnostic test like a NAAT for TB.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data ($p$, $S$, $C$) to calculate a unique quantity (the post-test probability).

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Post-Test Probability**\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that the patient has the disease (tuberculosis).\n- $D^c$: The event that the patient does not have the disease.\n- $T$: The event that the NAAT result is positive.\n- $T^c$: The event that the NAAT result is negative.\n\nThe given information can be translated into the language of conditional probability:\n- The pretest probability of disease is $P(D) = p$.\n- The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n- Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disease: $S = P(T|D)$.\n- Specificity is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disease: $C = P(T^c|D^c)$.\n\nWe are asked to find the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, we can express $P(D|T)$ as:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\n\nThe terms in the numerator are known: $P(T|D) = S$ and $P(D) = p$. The denominator, $P(T)$, is the overall probability of a positive test result, regardless of the patient's true disease status. To find $P(T)$, we use the law of total probability, partitioning the event $T$ by the events $D$ and $D^c$:\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nWe need to determine the term $P(T|D^c)$, which represents the probability of a positive test given the patient does not have the disease (the false positive rate). This can be derived from the definition of specificity, $C$. For a given condition (in this case, $D^c$), the event of a positive test ($T$) and a negative test ($T^c$) are complementary. Therefore:\n$$\nP(T|D^c) + P(T^c|D^c) = 1\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of specificity, $C = P(T^c|D^c)$, we find the false positive rate:\n$$\nP(T|D^c) = 1 - C\n$$\nNow we can write the full expression for $P(T)$ using the provided symbols:\n$$\nP(T) = (S)(p) + (1 - C)(1 - p)\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $P(T)$ back into Bayes' theorem, we arrive at the general formula for the post-test probability of disease given a positive test (also known as the Positive Predictive Value, PPV):\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{S \\cdot p}{S \\cdot p + (1 - C)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- $p = 0.25$\n- $S = 0.90$\n- $C = 0.98$\n\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.25)}{(0.90)(0.25) + (1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.25)}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the terms:\n- Numerator: $(0.90)(0.25) = 0.225$. This term represents the true positives.\n- Denominator, first term: $(0.90)(0.25) = 0.225$.\n- Denominator, second term: $(1 - 0.98)(1 - 0.25) = (0.02)(0.75) = 0.015$. This term represents the false positives.\n- Denominator, total: $0.225 + 0.015 = 0.240$. This is the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$.\n\nNow, compute the final fraction:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{0.225}{0.240}\n$$\nTo simplify, we can write this as $\\frac{225}{240} = \\frac{15 \\times 15}{15 \\times 16} = \\frac{15}{16}$.\n\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{15}{16} = 0.9375\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.9375$ already has exactly four significant figures.",

In Cohort L, the $PPV$ is less than $10\\%$.**\n- From our calculations for Cohort L, $PPV_L \\approx 0.086837$.\n- This corresponds to approximately $8.68\\%$.\n- The statement asserts that $PPV_L < 0.10$ (or $10\\%$).\n- $0.086837 < 0.10$, so the statement holds.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The $NPV$ in Cohort H is lower than the $NPV$ in Cohort L.**\n- From our calculations: $NPV_H \\approx 0.997348$ and $NPV_L \\approx 0.999949$.\n- The statement asserts that $NPV_H < NPV_L$.\n- Indeed, $0.997348 < 0.999949$. As prevalence increases, the expected number of diseased individuals rises, leading to more potential false negatives relative to the number of true negatives, which reduces the NPV.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If, in Cohort L, specificity were increased from $0.99$ to $0.999$ (with sensitivity and prevalence unchanged), the $PPV$ would necessarily exceed $50\\%$.**\n- We must re-calculate PPV for Cohort L with the new specificity, $S_p' = 0.999$.\n- Prevalence $p_L = 0.001$ and sensitivity $S_e = 0.95$ are unchanged.\n- The number of true positives remains $TP_L = 95$.\n- The number of non-diseased individuals remains $99{,}900$.\n- The new expected number of false positives is $FP_L' = 99{,}900 \\times (1 - S_p') = 99{,}900 \\times (1 - 0.999) = 99{,}900 \\times 0.001 = 99.9$.\n- The new PPV is $PPV_L' = \\frac{TP_L}{TP_L + FP_L'} = \\frac{95}{95 + 99.9} = \\frac{95}{194.9} \\approx 0.4874$.\n- This value corresponds to approximately $48.7\\%$.\n- The statement asserts that $PPV_L' > 0.50$ (or $50\\%$).\n- Our calculation shows $0.4874 \\not> 0.50$. The statement is false.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. In Cohort H, the $PPV$ is approximately $83\\%$.**\n- From our calculations for Cohort H, $PPV_H = \\frac{95}{114} \\approx 0.833333$.\n- This corresponds to $83.33...\\%$.\n- The statement claims the value is \"approximately $83\\%$\". $83.33...\\%$ is a value that can be reasonably approximated as $83\\%$.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.",
