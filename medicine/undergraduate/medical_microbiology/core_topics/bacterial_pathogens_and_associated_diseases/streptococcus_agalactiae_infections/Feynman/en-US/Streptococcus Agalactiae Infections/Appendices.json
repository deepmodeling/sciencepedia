            "problem": "Antenatal clinics routinely screen for maternal colonization with Group B Streptococcus (GBS), scientifically known as Streptococcus agalactiae, because colonization can lead to neonatal disease. Consider a clinic that enrolls $n = 500$ pregnant women for screening. Suppose epidemiologic surveillance establishes a true prevalence $p = 0.20$ for GBS colonization in this clinic population, and the chosen screening culture has sensitivity $s = 0.90$. Prevalence is defined as the probability that a randomly selected individual is colonized, and sensitivity is defined as the conditional probability that the test is positive given that an individual is truly colonized. Assume each woman's colonization status is independent and that, conditional on colonization, detections by the culture are independent across individuals. For simplicity, ignore false positives (that is, assume specificity is effectively $1$ for the purpose of counting detected colonization events).\n\nStarting from these definitions and the laws of expectation for independent Bernoulli trials, derive expressions for the expected number of truly colonized women and the expected number of colonized women detected by the screening culture in terms of $n$, $p$, and $s$, and then compute their numerical values for $n = 500$, $p = 0.20$, and $s = 0.90$. Report the final answer as a two-entry row matrix using the LaTeX $\\texttt{pmatrix}$ environment, in the order $\\left(C_{\\text{true}}, C_{\\text{detected}}\\right)$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Number of women screened: $n = 500$\n- True prevalence of GBS colonization: $p = 0.20$\n- Sensitivity of the screening culture: $s = 0.90$\n- Definition of prevalence: The probability that a randomly selected individual is colonized, $P(\\text{colonized}) = p$.\n- Definition of sensitivity: The conditional probability that the test is positive given that an individual is truly colonized, $P(\\text{test positive} | \\text{colonized}) = s$.\n- Assumption: Each woman's colonization status is independent.\n- Assumption: Conditional on colonization, detections by the culture are independent across individuals.\n- Assumption: Ignore false positives (specificity is effectively $1$). This implies $P(\\text{test positive} | \\text{not colonized}) = 0$.\n- Objective: Derive expressions for the expected number of truly colonized women ($E[C_{\\text{true}}]$) and the expected number of colonized women detected by the screening culture ($E[C_{\\text{detected}}]$) in terms of $n$, $p$, and $s$.\n- Objective: Compute the numerical values for these expectations.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the fields of epidemiology and medical microbiology. The concepts of prevalence, sensitivity, and screening are standard and well-defined. The numerical values provided ($p=0.20$, $s=0.90$) are realistic for *Streptococcus agalactiae* screening. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and assumptions (e.g., independence, specificity of $1$) to construct a solvable probabilistic model. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles of mathematics or science, is formalizable, complete, and internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the fundamental definitions of probability and expectation for Bernoulli trials.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the expected number of truly colonized women, which we denote as $E[C_{\\text{true}}]$.\nLet $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th woman in the cohort, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We define $X_i = 1$ if the $i$-th woman is truly colonized with GBS, and $X_i = 0$ if she is not.\nThe problem states that the prevalence of colonization is $p$. This is the probability that a randomly selected woman is colonized. Therefore, for any woman $i$:\n$$P(X_i = 1) = p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - p$$\nEach $X_i$ is a Bernoulli-distributed random variable with parameter $p$. The expectation of a single such variable is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$$\nThe total number of truly colonized women in the sample of size $n$, denoted by the random variable $C_{\\text{true}}$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected number of truly colonized women is the sum of the individual expectations. Since the women's colonization statuses are independent, this property holds.\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nAs $E[X_i] = p$ for all $i$, we have:\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = np$$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the expected number of colonized women detected by the screening, denoted $E[C_{\\text{detected}}]$.\nLet $D_i$ be an indicator random variable such that $D_i = 1$ if the $i$-th woman is detected as being colonized (i.e., her test is positive), and $D_i=0$ otherwise.\nTo find the expectation $E[D_i]$, we must find the probability $P(D_i=1)$. A woman is detected if her test result is positive. We use the law of total probability, conditioning on the true colonization status. Let $C_i$ represent the event that woman $i$ is colonized, and $\\neg C_i$ the event she is not. Let $T_i^+$ be the event her test is positive.\n$$P(D_i=1) = P(T_i^+) = P(T_i^+ | C_i)P(C_i) + P(T_i^+ | \\neg C_i)P(\\neg C_i)$$\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- The prevalence, $P(C_i) = p$. Consequently, $P(\\neg C_i) = 1-p$.\n- The sensitivity, $P(T_i^+ | C_i) = s$.\n- The specificity is $1$, which means the false positive rate is $0$. Thus, $P(T_i^+ | \\neg C_i) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these definitions into the equation for $P(D_i=1)$:\n$$P(D_i=1) = (s)(p) + (0)(1-p) = sp$$\nSo, $D_i$ is a Bernoulli-distributed random variable with parameter $sp$. The expectation of $D_i$ is:\n$$E[D_i] = sp$$\nThe total number of detected colonized women, $C_{\\text{detected}}$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$C_{\\text{detected}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i$$\nThe independence of colonization status and the conditional independence of detection imply that the events $D_i$ are independent. Using the linearity of expectation again:\n$$E[C_{\\text{detected}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} D_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[D_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} sp = nsp$$\nThis is the second required expression.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical values using the given data: $n = 500$, $p = 0.20$, and $s = 0.90$.\n\nExpected number of truly colonized women:\n$$E[C_{\\text{true}}] = np = 500 \\times 0.20 = 100$$\nExpected number of detected colonized women:\n$$E[C_{\\text{detected}}] = nsp = 500 \\times 0.20 \\times 0.90 = 100 \\times 0.90 = 90$$\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a two-entry row matrix with the values for the expected number of truly colonized women and detected colonized women, in that order.",

            "introduction": "Following from our understanding of screening, it is crucial to interpret the results of a diagnostic test correctly. A positive result does not always mean the person is truly colonized.

Express your answer as a decimal (not a fraction) and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are realistic for an infectious disease diagnostic test.\n\nWe are tasked with calculating the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of a Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) for *Streptococcus agalactiae*. The PPV is defined as the probability that a patient is truly colonized given that they have tested positive.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D+$: The event that a patient is truly colonized with *Streptococcus agalactiae*.\n- $D-$: The event that a patient is not colonized.\n- $T+$: The event that the NAAT result is positive.\n- $T-$: The event that the NAAT result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of colonization, which is the prior probability of a randomly selected patient being colonized: $P(D+) = 0.20$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is colonized: $P(T+|D+) = 0.95$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given that the patient is not colonized: $P(T-|D-) = 0.97$.\n\nFrom these initial probabilities, we can deduce two other essential probabilities:\n- The probability of a patient not being colonized is the complement of the prevalence: $P(D-) = 1 - P(D+) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n- The probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test given that the patient is not colonized. This is the complement of the specificity: $P(T+|D-) = 1 - P(T-|D-) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$.\n\nThe goal is to compute the Positive Predictive Value, $P(D+|T+)$. According to the core definition of conditional probability, this is given by:\n$$P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nwhere $P(D+ \\cap T+)$ is the joint probability of a patient being colonized and testing positive, and $P(T+)$ is the overall probability of any patient testing positive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(D+ \\cap T+)$. This is the probability of a true positive result. Using the definition of conditional probability, $P(T+|D+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(D+)}$, we can rearrange it to find the joint probability:\n$$P(D+ \\cap T+) = P(T+|D+) \\times P(D+)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(D+ \\cap T+) = 0.95 \\times 0.20 = 0.19$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T+)$. A positive test can occur in two mutually exclusive ways: a true positive (the patient is colonized and tests positive) or a false positive (the patient is not colonized but tests positive). We can express the total probability of a positive test using the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D+) + P(T+ \\cap D-)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $P(T+ \\cap D+) = 0.19$. We now calculate the second term, which is the probability of a false positive, $P(T+ \\cap D-)$. Using the same logic as for the true positives:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D-) = P(T+|D-) \\times P(D-)$$\nSubstituting the values we have:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D-) = 0.03 \\times 0.80 = 0.024$$\nNow, we sum these to find the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T+) = 0.19 + 0.024 = 0.214$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the PPV, $P(D+|T+)$, by substituting the values for the numerator and denominator into our original formula:\n$$P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(D+ \\cap T+)}{P(T+)} = \\frac{0.19}{0.214}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D+|T+) \\approx 0.887850467...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$P(D+|T+) \\approx 0.8879$$\nThis is the positive predictive value of the test in this patient population.",
