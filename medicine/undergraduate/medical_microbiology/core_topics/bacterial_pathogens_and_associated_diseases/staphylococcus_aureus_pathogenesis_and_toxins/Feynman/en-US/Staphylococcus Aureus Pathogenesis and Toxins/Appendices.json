Consider a red blood cell (RBC) membrane surface with a homogeneous density of independent binding sites accessible to Hla monomers. Assume the following physically grounded scenario based on mass-action kinetics and nucleation–polymerization:\n\n- A stable nucleus requires the collision and association of $s$ monomers on a single site, after which pore completion proceeds rapidly and does not limit the overall pore formation rate. This implies nucleation-limited kinetics where the pore formation rate per site is proportional to $c^{s}$, with $c$ being the bulk monomer concentration.\n- The surface binding sites are not saturated and the near-membrane monomer concentration is approximately equal to the bulk $c$ due to rapid diffusion.\n- The total pore formation rate per unit membrane area is proportional to the number of available sites per area, $A_{0}$.\n\nYou are given:\n- Nucleus size $s = 3$.\n- Nucleation rate constant $k_{n} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ $\\mathrm{s^{-1}\\,\\mu M^{-3}}$.\n- Binding site density $A_{0} = 1000$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m^{-2}}$.\n- Critical pore density for lysis $D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 100$ $\\mathrm{\\mu m^{-2}}$.\n- Target time window for observable lysis $T^{*} = 60$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nStarting from mass-action kinetics and the nucleation–polymerization framework described above, derive the functional relationship between the pore formation rate per unit area $R(c)$ and the monomer concentration $c$. Then, use this relationship to determine the threshold monomer concentration $c_{\\mathrm{th}}$ such that the system reaches $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ within time $T^{*}$ (assume a constant rate and negligible pore decay over $T^{*}$).
