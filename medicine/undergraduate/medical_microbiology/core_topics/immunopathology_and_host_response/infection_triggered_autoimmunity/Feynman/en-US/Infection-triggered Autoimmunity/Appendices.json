            "introduction": "Before exploring the molecular and cellular details of autoimmunity, the first step is often to establish a statistical link between a potential trigger, like an infection, and a disease. This practice introduces a fundamental tool from epidemiology, the odds ratio, used in case-control studies to quantify the strength of such associations. By working through the data from a hypothetical study on Guillain-Barré syndrome and *Campylobacter jejuni* infection , you will gain hands-on experience in calculating and interpreting this crucial measure of risk.",

            "problem": "A hospital-based case-control study investigates infection-triggered autoimmunity by assessing whether recent Campylobacter jejuni infection is associated with subsequent Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Recent infection is defined by serologic evidence of Campylobacter jejuni exposure within the prior four weeks. Among $100$ patients diagnosed with GBS (cases), $40$ have evidence of recent Campylobacter jejuni exposure. Among $100$ matched patients without neuropathy (controls), $10$ have evidence of recent Campylobacter jejuni exposure. Using the core definition that the odds ratio compares the odds of exposure in cases versus controls in a case-control design, compute the odds ratio for GBS following recent Campylobacter jejuni infection. Report the odds ratio as an exact value with no units. Then, based on established criteria for causal inference in epidemiology and known mechanisms of infection-triggered autoimmunity, briefly assess whether the magnitude of this association provides strong, moderate, or weak support for a causal relationship. The numerical answer must be a single number; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The odds ratio (OR) is calculated from the provided case-control study data. The association between *Campylobacter jejuni* infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a classic example of infection-triggered autoimmunity, mediated by molecular mimicry.\n\nFirst, we organize the data into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table:\n- Number of cases (with GBS): $100$\n- Exposed cases ($a$): $40$\n- Unexposed cases ($c$): $100 - 40 = 60$\n- Number of controls (without neuropathy): $100$\n- Exposed controls ($b$): $10$\n- Unexposed controls ($d$): $100 - 10 = 90$\n\nThe odds of exposure among cases is the ratio of exposed to unexposed cases:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}} = \\frac{a}{c} = \\frac{40}{60}\n$$\nThe odds of exposure among controls is the ratio of exposed to unexposed controls:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}} = \\frac{b}{d} = \\frac{10}{90}\n$$\nThe odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{cases}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{controls}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{40 \\times 90}{10 \\times 60} = \\frac{3600}{600} = 6\n$$\nAn odds ratio of $6$ indicates a strong association. In epidemiology, OR values greater than $3.0$ are typically considered strong evidence that the finding is not due to chance or confounding variables. This strong statistical link, combined with the well-established biological plausibility (molecular mimicry between *C. jejuni* lipooligosaccharides and human nerve gangliosides), provides compelling support for a causal relationship.",

            "introduction": "Infections can provoke self-destructive immune responses through several distinct mechanisms. One of the most potent and rapid is activation by bacterial superantigens, which bypass the normal rules of T cell activation to trigger a massive, polyclonal response. This exercise  requires you to act as an immunologist, interpreting flow cytometry data to deduce the underlying mechanism of T cell expansion. You will learn to recognize the characteristic signature of a superantigen response and distinguish it from a conventional or bystander response, a critical skill in both clinical diagnostics and research.",

            "problem": "A clinician collects peripheral blood from a patient with acute pharyngitis at day $0$, day $5$, and week $4$. Flow cytometry (FC) with a panel of anti–T cell receptor (TCR) V$\\beta$ family antibodies shows that TCR V$\\beta$ $2$-positive T cells rise from $5\\%$ of total T cells at day $0$ to $25\\%$ at day $5$, then fall to $7\\%$ by week $4$. The absolute T cell count remains within $10\\%$ of baseline across time points. The patient’s symptoms resolve without immunosuppression. No other V$\\beta$ family shows a change greater than $3\\%$ in absolute frequency over the same interval.\n\nUsing first principles of antigen recognition and T cell activation in medical microbiology, evaluate whether a bacterial superantigen is a likely driver of the observed V$\\beta$ skewing, and identify the most informative additional evidence to test this mechanism and to link the event to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. The marked but transient V$\\beta$ $2$ expansion is characteristic of superantigen exposure because superantigens cross-link Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II on antigen-presenting cells with the TCR V$\\beta$ region independent of peptide, activating many clones that share V$\\beta$ $2$. Additional evidence should include: demonstration that the patient’s isolate encodes and secretes a V$\\beta$ $2$-reactive superantigen (for example, toxic shock syndrome toxin $1$) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); in vitro proliferation of the patient’s T cells to the isolate in a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II–dependent manner with blockade by anti–HLA-DR and anti–V$\\beta$ $2$ antibodies; TCR sequencing showing polyclonality within the V$\\beta$ $2$ compartment; and a temporal rise in autoreactivity (for example, new autoantibodies or self-antigen–reactive T cells) following the burst.\n\nB. The pattern is more consistent with a conventional peptide-specific response because antigen-driven clonal selection often enriches a single V$\\beta$ family. Additional evidence should show a single dominant complementarity-determining region (CDR) $3$ clonotype within V$\\beta$ $2$, MHC class I restriction demonstrated by HLA class I tetramers, and lack of response when MHC class II is blocked.\n\nC. The pattern indicates nonspecific bystander activation driven by cytokines, which should cause global increases across many V$\\beta$ families rather than a single family. Additional evidence should include low-level, widespread V$\\beta$ expansions, reduced expression of activation markers due to anergy, and normalization without any pathogen-derived factor detection.\n\nD. The pattern best supports molecular mimicry between a pathogen peptide and a self peptide. Additional evidence should focus on sequence homology between pathogen and self peptides, binding of these peptides to the same HLA class I molecule, and expansion limited to CD$8^+$ V$\\beta$ $2$ cells detected by peptide–MHC class I tetramers.",
            "solution": "The correct option is A. The patient's data show a massive, rapid, and transient expansion of T cells expressing the V$\\beta$ $2$ T-cell receptor (TCR) chain, increasing from $5\\%$ to $25\\%$ of the total T cell population in five days before contracting. This expansion is highly focused on a single V$\\beta$ family. This pattern is the classic signature of a superantigen response. Superantigens are microbial toxins that bypass normal antigen presentation by cross-linking MHC class II molecules directly to specific V$\\beta$ regions of TCRs, leading to polyclonal activation of all T cells bearing that V$\\beta$ chain.\n\n- **Option A** correctly identifies this mechanism and proposes a comprehensive experimental plan to confirm it: (1) identify a superantigen-producing pathogen in the patient; (2) demonstrate in vitro that T cell proliferation is dependent on MHC class II and the V$\\beta$ $2$ chain; (3) confirm the polyclonal nature of the expanded T cells via TCR sequencing; and (4) look for the subsequent development of autoreactivity, which connects the superantigen event to infection-triggered autoimmunity.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect because a conventional peptide response would be oligoclonal, not polyclonal, and would not typically cause such a massive expansion of an entire V$\\beta$ family.\n\n- **Option C** is incorrect because bystander activation is generally non-specific and would cause a broader, less dramatic expansion across multiple V$\\beta$ families, which contradicts the data.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because molecular mimicry is a mechanism of specific antigen recognition and cannot explain the polyclonal, V$\\beta$-specific activation observed. It is a potential downstream consequence, not the initial trigger for this type of T cell expansion.",

            "introduction": "Autoimmunity is often not a static event but a dynamic process that can evolve and expand over time. An initial immune response against a single part of a self-protein can \"spread\" to target other parts of the same protein or even different proteins, a phenomenon known as epitope spreading. This practice  presents a clinical timeline of an emerging autoimmune response following a streptococcal infection. By analyzing the sequential appearance of different autoantibodies, you will learn to identify intramolecular epitope spreading and devise an experimental strategy to track and characterize this critical process in the progression of chronic autoimmune disease.",

            "problem": "A previously healthy student presents with pharyngitis due to Group A Streptococcus (GAS), confirmed by throat culture and rapid antigen testing at time $t=0$ weeks. Serum collected at $t=0$ weeks shows no autoantibodies. Beginning at $t=2$ weeks, a laboratory panel detects Immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies targeting a defined self-peptide A derived from the cardiac myosin heavy chain. By $t=4$ weeks, Immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies to peptide A are present. At $t=8$ weeks, a new IgG autoantibody specificity emerges, targeting a non-overlapping peptide B that maps to a distinct epitope on the same cardiac myosin heavy chain protein. The pharyngitis resolves clinically by $t=1$ week, and GAS-specific antibodies peak at $t=3$ weeks. No autoantibodies were observed to proteins outside cardiac myosin up to $t=4$ weeks. \n\nUsing only foundational immunology principles—antibodies recognize specific epitopes on antigens; infections can cause tissue damage and antigen release; germinal center reactions and linked recognition by T helper cells can drive diversification of B-cell specificities over time—decide whether the observed pattern indicates spreading, and identify the most appropriate sampling strategy to test and classify the spreading. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. The pattern indicates intramolecular epitope spreading within cardiac myosin; test this by serially sampling serum at $t=0,4,8,12$ weeks and performing overlapping peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) spanning the full cardiac myosin sequence, plus parallel assays to a panel of other cardiac autoantigens, to track the emergence order of new specificities and discriminate intra- versus intermolecular spread.\n\nB. The pattern does not indicate spreading; anti-peptide B emergence reflects normal isotype maturation; test this by a single late sample at $t=8$ weeks measuring only Immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass distribution to peptide A.\n\nC. The pattern indicates intermolecular epitope spreading to unrelated proteins; test this by measuring antibodies to GAS proteins at $t=8$ weeks in a single cross-sectional sample, because pathogen-specific responses determine autoimmunity breadth.\n\nD. The pattern is indeterminate; the only way to test for spreading is to measure serum cytokines and complement levels at $t=8$ weeks, because humoral specificity is not informative for spreading classification.",
            "solution": "The correct option is A. The observed pattern is a classic example of intramolecular epitope spreading. The immune response begins against a single epitope (peptide A) on the cardiac myosin protein, evidenced by the initial IgM and subsequent IgG response. Weeks later, the response diversifies to include a new specificity against a different epitope (peptide B) on the *same* protein. This diversification, where the autoimmune attack broadens its targets within the original autoantigen molecule, is the definition of intramolecular spreading. It is often driven by initial tissue damage, which exposes new parts of the protein to the immune system.\n\n- **Option A** provides the most appropriate and comprehensive strategy to test and classify this phenomenon. Serial sampling is essential to track the temporal evolution of the response. Using overlapping peptide ELISAs is the gold-standard method for high-resolution mapping of epitopes across the entire cardiac myosin protein. Crucially, assaying for reactivity against other cardiac autoantigens in parallel allows for the critical distinction between intramolecular (reactivity confined to myosin) and intermolecular (reactivity spreading to other proteins) spreading.\n\n- **Option B** is incorrect. The emergence of a new epitope specificity (anti-peptide B) is not 'normal isotype maturation'; isotype maturation (or class switching) refers to the change from IgM to IgG for the same epitope.\n\n- **Option C** incorrectly classifies the event as intermolecular spreading, whereas the data explicitly state both epitopes are on the same protein.\n\n- **Option D** is incorrect because epitope spreading is fundamentally defined by changes in antigenic specificity; therefore, tracking humoral (antibody) specificity is not only informative but is the primary method for its classification.",
