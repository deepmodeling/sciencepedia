            "problem": "Cryptococcus neoformans is a thermotolerant yeast whose ability to sustain exponential growth at human body temperature is a key virulence trait. In rich medium such as Sabouraud dextrose broth, optical density (OD) at $600$ nm, an optical density (OD) measurement, is proportional to viable biomass during the exponential (log) phase. Exponential biomass accumulation in well-mixed batch culture is modeled by the first-order kinetic law $dX/dt=\\mu X$, where $X$ is biomass and $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate. Because $OD(t)\\propto X(t)$, the same exponential law applies to $OD(t)$ during log phase.\n\nA clinical isolate of Cryptococcus neoformans is inoculated into Sabouraud dextrose broth and incubated at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with aeration. OD at $600$ nm is recorded as $OD_{0}=0.05$ at $t=0$ hours and $OD_{t}=0.40$ at $t=6$ hours, and the culture remains in exponential phase over this interval.\n\nUsing the exponential growth law and the proportionality of OD to biomass, derive an expression for the specific growth rate $\\mu$ in terms of $OD_{t}$, $OD_{0}$, and $t$, and compute its value for the given data. Round your final numerical value for $\\mu$ to three significant figures, and express $\\mu$ in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThen, based on the computed $\\mu$, assess whether thermotolerance is operationally adequate under the following assay criterion: thermotolerance is considered adequate if the exponential-phase doubling time at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in rich medium is less than $3$ hours. Provide your interpretation in words, but the final answer should be only the numerical value of $\\mu$.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, well-posed, objective, and consistent with principles of microbiology and bioprocess kinetics.\n\nThe problem states that the growth of *Cryptococcus neoformans* follows a first-order kinetic law during the exponential phase. Since the optical density, $OD$, is proportional to the biomass concentration, $X$, the rate of change of $OD$ also follows this law. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(OD)}{dt} = \\mu \\cdot OD\n$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate and $t$ is time.\n\nTo find an expression for $\\mu$, we must solve this first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by the method of separation of variables.\n$$\n\\frac{d(OD)}{OD} = \\mu \\, dt\n$$\nWe then integrate both sides of the equation over the time interval from $t=0$ to a general time $t$. The corresponding optical densities are $OD_0$ at $t=0$ and $OD_t$ at time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{OD_0}^{OD_t} \\frac{1}{OD} \\, d(OD) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mu \\, d\\tau\n$$\nThe left-hand side integrates to the natural logarithm of $OD$, and the right-hand side integrates to $\\mu$ multiplied by time, as $\\mu$ is constant during exponential growth.\n$$\n[\\ln(OD)]_{OD_0}^{OD_t} = [\\mu \\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(OD_t) - \\ln(OD_0) = \\mu t - \\mu \\cdot 0\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{OD_t}{OD_0}\\right) = \\mu t\n$$\nThis is the integrated form of the exponential growth law. Now, we derive the expression for the specific growth rate $\\mu$ by rearranging the equation:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{t} \\ln\\left(\\frac{OD_t}{OD_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression gives $\\mu$ in terms of the initial optical density $OD_0$, the optical density $OD_t$ at time $t$, and the elapsed time $t$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\mu$ using the data provided in the problem. The given values are:\nInitial time: $t_0 = 0 \\, \\mathrm{h}$\nInitial OD: $OD_0 = 0.05$\nFinal time: $t = 6 \\, \\mathrm{h}$\nFinal OD: $OD_t = 0.40$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{6 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.40}{0.05}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{6 \\, \\mathrm{h}} \\ln(8)\n$$\nThe natural logarithm of $8$ can be expressed as $\\ln(2^3) = 3 \\ln(2)$.\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{3 \\ln(2)}{6 \\, \\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2 \\, \\mathrm{h}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$, we can calculate the numerical value of $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{2} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.3465735... \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\mu \\approx 0.347 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we must assess whether the thermotolerance is adequate. The criterion is that the doubling time, $t_d$, at $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ must be less than $3$ hours. The doubling time is the time required for the biomass, and thus the OD, to double its value, i.e., $OD_{t_d} = 2 \\cdot OD_0$. We can find the relationship between $t_d$ and $\\mu$ using our integrated growth equation:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{2 \\cdot OD_0}{OD_0}\\right) = \\mu t_d\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\mu t_d\n$$\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}\n$$\nUsing our exact expression for $\\mu = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{2} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{2 \\, \\mathrm{h}}} = 2 \\, \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe calculated doubling time is exactly $2$ hours. We now compare this value to the assay criterion:\n$$\nt_d = 2 \\, \\mathrm{h} < 3 \\, \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nSince the doubling time of $2$ hours is less than the threshold of $3$ hours, the thermotolerance of this clinical isolate is considered operationally adequate under the specified criterion. The final answer required is only the numerical value for $\\mu$.",

It is scientifically grounded in standard microbiological techniques, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and expressed in objective, formal language. All necessary information and definitions are provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the fungal burden, denoted as $B$, in units of colony-forming units per gram of lung tissue ($\\mathrm{CFU/g}$). This quantity is defined as the total number of CFUs in the original tissue sample divided by the mass of that sample.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided:\n- Mass of the lung fragment: $m_{\\text{tissue}} = 0.50$ g.\n- Final volume of the tissue homogenate: $V_{\\text{homogenate}} = 1.0$ mL.\n- Dilution factor used for plating: $D = 10^{-3}$.\n- Volume of the diluted homogenate plated: $V_{\\text{plated}} = 0.10$ mL.\n- Number of colonies observed on the plate: $N_{\\text{colonies}} = 50$.\n\nThe problem states that each colony arises from a single colony-forming unit (CFU) and that the plating efficiency is $1$. Therefore, the number of CFUs in the plated volume is equal to the number of colonies counted:\n$$ N_{\\text{CFU\\_plated}} = N_{\\text{colonies}} = 50 $$\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as follows:\n\n1.  First, we determine the concentration of CFUs in the diluted sample that was plated.

Next, we calculate the concentration of CFUs in the original, undiluted homogenate, $C_{\\text{homogenate}}$. The diluted sample was prepared from the original homogenate using a dilution factor $D$. Therefore, the concentration of the original homogenate is greater than the diluted concentration by a factor of $1/D$. This follows from the principle of conservation of particles during dilution, and is stated as a core definition in the problem.\n    $$ C_{\\text{homogenate}} = C_{\\text{diluted}} \\times \\frac{1}{D} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $C_{\\text{diluted}}$:\n    $$ C_{\\text{homogenate}} = \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{colonies}}}{V_{\\text{plated}}} \\right) \\frac{1}{D} = \\frac{N_{\\text{colonies}}}{V_{\\text{plated}} D} $$\n\n3.

This is the concentration of the homogenate multiplied by its total volume.\n    $$ N_{\\text{total\\_CFU}} = C_{\\text{homogenate}} \\times V_{\\text{homogenate}} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $C_{\\text{homogenate}}$:\n    $$ N_{\\text{total\\_CFU}} = \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{colonies}}}{V_{\\text{plated}} D} \\right) V_{\\text{homogenate}} $$\n\n4.
