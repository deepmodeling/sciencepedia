It is well-posed, with sufficient information and clear objectives, leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and the solution process can proceed.\n\nTo derive the expression for the periplasmic concentration, $C_{\\text{peri}}$, we begin by establishing a mass balance equation for the antibiotic within the periplasmic compartment. The rate of change of $C_{\\text{peri}}$ with respect to time, $t$, is the sum of the rate of influx and the rate of efflux.\n\nLet $\\frac{d C_{\\text{peri}}}{dt}$ be the net rate of change of the periplasmic concentration.

The effective rate constant $P$ (with units of $\\text{s}^{-1}$) incorporates geometric factors and permeability, allowing us to write the rate of concentration change due to net influx through the porins as $P(C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{peri}})$.\n\nThe active efflux is modeled as a first-order removal process, meaning the rate of concentration decrease is proportional to the current periplasmic concentration $C_{\\text{peri}}$. This is described by the term $k_{\\text{eff}} C_{\\text{peri}}$, where $k_{\\text{eff}}$ is the first-order efflux rate constant.\n\nCombining these terms, we construct the differential equation for mass balance:\n$$\n\\frac{d C_{\\text{peri}}}{dt} = P (C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{peri}}) - k_{\\text{eff}} C_{\\text{peri}}\n$$\n\nAt steady-state, the periplasmic concentration is constant, which implies that its time derivative is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d C_{\\text{peri}}}{dt} = 0\n$$\n\nSetting the mass balance equation to zero allows us to solve for the steady-state concentration, $C_{\\text{peri}}$:\n$$\n0 = P (C_{\\text{out}} - C_{\\text{peri}}) - k_{\\text{eff}} C_{\\text{peri}}\n$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$\n0 = P C_{\\text{out}} - P C_{\\text{peri}} - k_{\\text{eff}} C_{\\text{peri}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange the equation to solve for $C_{\\text{peri}}$:\n$$\nP C_{\\text{peri}} + k_{\\text{eff}} C_{\\text{peri}} = P C_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nFactoring out $C_{\\text{peri}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri}} (P + k_{\\text{eff}}) = P C_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nIsolating $C_{\\text{peri}}$ yields the desired analytic expression:\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri}} = \\frac{P}{P + k_{\\text{eff}}} C_{\\text{out}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that the steady-state periplasmic concentration is a fraction of the external concentration, determined by the ratio of the influx rate constant to the sum of the influx and efflux rate constants.\n\nNext, we use this expression to evaluate the periplasmic concentrations for Strain $A$ and Strain $B$ with the given parameters: $C_{\\text{out}} = 50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nFor Strain $A$:\n$P_A = 0.12\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{eff},A} = 0.08\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri},A} = \\frac{P_A}{P_A + k_{\\text{eff},A}} C_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{0.12}{0.12 + 0.08} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri},A} = \\frac{0.12}{0.20} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 0.6 \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 30\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\n\nFor Strain $B$:\n$P_B = 0.03\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\text{eff},B} = 0.15\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri},B} = \\frac{P_B}{P_B + k_{\\text{eff},B}} C_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.15} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{peri},B} = \\frac{0.03}{0.18} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\text{M} = \\frac{50}{6}\\,\\mu\\text{M} = \\frac{25}{3}\\,\\mu\\text{M} \\approx 8.333...\\,\\mu\\text{M}\n$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the fold difference $\\frac{C_{\\text{peri},A}}{C_{\\text{peri},B}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{C_{\\text{peri},A}}{C_{\\text{peri},B}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{\\frac{25}{3}\\,\\mu\\text{M}} = \\frac{30 \\times 3}{25} = \\frac{90}{25}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{90}{25} = \\frac{18 \\times 5}{5 \\times 5} = \\frac{18}{5} = 3.6\n$$\nThe problem requires this final value to be rounded to four significant figures.

The relative resistance $R_{A/B}$ is defined as the ratio of the hydrolytic half-lives of antibiotic $A$ to antibiotic $B$, $t_{1/2, A}/t_{1/2, B}$, under conditions of low substrate concentration.\n\nWe begin with the Michaelis-Menten equation, which describes the velocity $v$ of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction:\n$$v = -\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{cat}[E]_T[S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $[E]_T$ is the total enzyme concentration, $k_{cat}$ is the turnover number, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe problem specifies that the reaction occurs in the low-substrate regime, where the substrate concentration is much less than the Michaelis constant, i.e., $[S] \\ll K_m$.

We interpolate to find $\\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})} = 5 + (6 - 5) \\frac{5.0 - (\\log_{10}(1.2) + 5)}{(\\log_{10}(8) + 4) - (\\log_{10}(1.2) + 5)} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})} = 5 + \\frac{-\\log_{10}(1.2)}{\\log_{10}(8) - \\log_{10}(1.2) - 1} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})} = 5 + \\frac{-\\log_{10}(1.2)}{\\log_{10}(8/1.2) - 1} = 5 + \\frac{-\\log_{10}(1.2)}{\\log_{10}(20/3) - 1} $$\nSubstituting values $\\log_{10}(1.2) \\approx 0.07918$ and $\\log_{10}(8) \\approx 0.90309$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})} \\approx 5 + \\frac{-0.07918}{0.90309 - 0.07918 - 1} = 5 + \\frac{-0.07918}{-0.17609} \\approx 5 + 0.44966 = 5.44966\\,\\mathrm{h} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Tolerance Index (TI)**\n\nThe tolerance index is defined as the ratio of the MDK values:\n$$ \\mathrm{TI} = \\frac{\\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(ppGpp\\text{-induced})}}{\\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}^{(\\text{wild-type})}} $$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$ \\mathrm{TI} = \\frac{5.44966\\,\\mathrm{h}}{2.75647\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 1.97703 $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the tolerance index is $1.98$.\n\n**3. Conceptual Explanation**\n\nThe observation that $\\mathrm{TI} > 1$ despite identical MICs can be explained by the fundamental difference between what MIC and MDK measure, combined with the specific mechanisms of the antibiotic and the cellular response.\n\n- **MIC vs. MDK:** The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is a measure of **growth inhibition**. It is determined at an endpoint ($18$–$24\\,\\mathrm{h}$) and represents the lowest drug concentration that prevents a net increase in bacterial population to a visible density. It does not measure the rate of cell death. In contrast, the Minimum Duration for Killing ($\\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}$) is a kinetic parameter that measures the **rate of bactericidal activity**. A higher MDK indicates a slower killing rate.\n\n- **$\\beta$-Lactam Mechanism of Action:** Penicillin and other $\\beta$-lactams are bactericidal because they inhibit penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are essential enzymes for peptidoglycan synthesis. This disruption of cell wall construction is lethal primarily to actively growing and dividing cells, which are constantly remodeling their peptidoglycan. In non-growing or slowly growing cells, the cell wall is more static, and inhibition of its synthesis has a much less immediate and potent lethal effect.\n\n- **Stringent Response ($ppGpp$):** The stringent response, mediated by the alarmone $ppGpp$, is a global bacterial stress response system. Its activation leads to a widespread shutdown of growth-related activities, including ribosome production, DNA replication, and, crucially, cell wall synthesis.\n\n- **Synthesis:** The problem states that the engineered strain induces $ppGpp$ upon antibiotic exposure. When this strain is exposed to the $\\beta$-lactam, it activates the stringent response. This response dramatically slows down or halts cell growth and peptidoglycan synthesis. By ceasing the very process the antibiotic targets for its lethal effect, the cells become phenotypically **tolerant**—they are not killed, or are killed much more slowly. This directly leads to a slower decline in viable counts and thus a significantly larger $\\mathrm{MDK}_{99.9}$ value, resulting in a $\\mathrm{TI} > 1$.\n\nThe **MIC remains unchanged** because it reflects the inherent susceptibility of the PBP targets to the antibiotic. In both strains, the antibiotic concentration required to bind the PBPs and prevent cell division—thereby halting net population growth over $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$—is the same. The MIC assay is insensitive to the *rate* at which cells die, only to whether the population can ultimately expand. Since the drug is equally effective at *inhibiting* the cellular machinery for growth in both strains, the MIC is identical. The observed phenomenon is a classic example of antibiotic tolerance, where susceptibility (MIC) is divorced from the killing rate (MDK).",
