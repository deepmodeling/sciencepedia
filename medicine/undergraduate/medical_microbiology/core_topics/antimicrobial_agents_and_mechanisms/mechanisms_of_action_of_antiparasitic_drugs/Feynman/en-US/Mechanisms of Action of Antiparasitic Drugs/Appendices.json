            "problem": "A central feature of the mechanism of action of the antiparasitic drug chloroquine is its accumulation in the acidic digestive vacuole of the malaria parasite, where it interferes with heme detoxification. Chloroquine is a diprotic weak base with two sequential protonation steps, and only its neutral form permeates the vacuolar membrane; protonated forms are effectively membrane-impermeant and become trapped. Starting from the Henderson–Hasselbalch (HH) relation and mass-action equilibria for a diprotic base, derive an expression for the ratio of total chloroquine concentration in the vacuole to that in the cytosol as a function of the vacuolar pH, cytosolic pH, and the two acid dissociation constants of its conjugate acids. Assume:\n- Only the neutral base, denoted by $B$, can cross the membrane and therefore satisfies $[B]_{\\text{vacuole}} = [B]_{\\text{cytosol}}$ at equilibrium.\n- The two protonation equilibria are $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}$ with acid dissociation constant $K_{a1}$ and $BH_{2}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons BH^{+} + H^{+}$ with acid dissociation constant $K_{a2}$.\n- The Henderson–Hasselbalch (HH) relation applies in each compartment for both protonation steps.\n\nThen, using $pK_{a1} = 8.1$, $pK_{a2} = 10.2$, a vacuolar pH of $5.0$, and a cytosolic pH of $7.2$, evaluate your derived expression to predict the vacuole-to-cytosol total concentration ratio.

The following solution is derived based on the provided principles and data.\n\nLet $B$ represent the neutral form of the diprotic weak base chloroquine. Let $BH^{+}$ be its singly protonated form and $BH_{2}^{2+}$ be its doubly protonated form. The total concentration of chloroquine, $[C]_{\\text{total}}$, in any compartment is the sum of the concentrations of all its forms:\n$$[C]_{\\text{total}} = [B] + [BH^{+}] + [BH_{2}^{2+}]$$\n\nThe problem provides the acid dissociation equilibria and their corresponding constants:\n1.  $BH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}$ with a constant $K_{a1}$. The law of mass action for this equilibrium is:\n    $$K_{a1} = \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{[BH^{+}]}$$\n2.  $BH_{2}^{2+} \\rightleftharpoons BH^{+} + H^{+}$ with a constant $K_{a2}$. The law of mass action for this equilibrium is:\n    $$K_{a2} = \\frac{[BH^{+}][H^{+}]}{[BH_{2}^{2+}]}$$\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the protonated forms, $[BH^{+}]$ and $[BH_{2}^{2+}]$, in terms of the neutral form, $[B]$, and the proton concentration, $[H^{+}]$. Rearranging the equilibrium expressions:\nFrom the first equilibrium:\n$$[BH^{+}] = \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{K_{a1}}$$\nFrom the second equilibrium:\n$$[BH_{2}^{2+}] = \\frac{[BH^{+}][H^{+}]}{K_{a2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[BH^{+}]$ into the equation for $[BH_{2}^{2+}]$:\n$$[BH_{2}^{2+}] = \\frac{1}{K_{a2}} \\left( \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{K_{a1}} \\right) [H^{+}] = \\frac{[B][H^{+}]^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $[BH^{+}]$ and $[BH_{2}^{2+}]$ into the equation for the total concentration:\n$$[C]_{\\text{total}} = [B] + \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{K_{a1}} + \\frac{[B][H^{+}]^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}}$$\nFactoring out $[B]$, we obtain a general expression for the total concentration in a given compartment:\n$$[C]_{\\text{total}} = [B] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_{a1}} + \\frac{[H^{+}]^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} \\right)$$\nThis verifies that the total concentration is a function of the local proton concentration $[H^{+}]$ and the concentration of the neutral base $[B]$.\n\nThe goal is to find the ratio $R$ of the total chloroquine concentration in the vacuole to that in the cytosol:\n$$R = \\frac{[C]_{\\text{total, vacuole}}}{[C]_{\\text{total, cytosol}}}$$\nApplying the general expression to each compartment:\n$$R = \\frac{[B]_{\\text{vacuole}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{vacuole}}}{K_{a1}} + \\frac{([H^{+}]_{\\text{vacuole}})^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} \\right)}{[B]_{\\text{cytosol}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]_{\\text{cytosol}}}{K_{a1}} + \\frac{([H^{+}]_{\\text{cytosol}})^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} \\right)}$$\nThe problem states that only the neutral form $B$ can cross the membrane, which leads to the equilibrium condition $[B]_{\\text{vacuole}} = [B]_{\\text{cytosol}}$.

These imply $[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}$ and $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$.

            "problem": "Albendazole binds to the parasite protein $\\beta$-tubulin and inhibits microtubule polymerization. Consider a simplified equilibrium model in which albendazole ($D$) binds to $\\beta$-tubulin ($T$) in a $1:1$ complex ($TD$), and only unbound $\\beta$-tubulin ($T$) can incorporate into growing microtubules. Assume steady state and that the free drug concentration is maintained at $200$ nM by the extracellular medium. The dissociation constant is given as $K_{d} = 50$ nM for the albendazole–$\\beta$-tubulin interaction. Use the law of mass action and the definition of the dissociation constant $K_{d}$, which at equilibrium satisfies $K_{d} \\equiv \\frac{[T][D]}{[TD]}$, and assume a homogeneous population of binding sites without cooperativity.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the normalized microtubule polymerization velocity under the influence of the drug albendazole. This can be solved by applying the principles of chemical equilibrium and receptor binding theory.\n\nFirst, we formalize the components of the system. Let $D$ represent albendazole, $T$ represent free $\\beta$-tubulin, and $TD$ represent the albendazole-$\\beta$-tubulin complex. The concentrations of these species are denoted by $[D]$, $[T]$, and $[TD]$, respectively. The total concentration of $\\beta$-tubulin, $[T]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of its free and bound forms:\n$$ [T]_{\\text{total}} = [T] + [TD] $$\n\nThe problem states that the binding interaction follows the law of mass action and is characterized by a dissociation constant, $K_d$, defined as:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[T][D]}{[TD]} $$\nThe given values are a constant free drug concentration of $[D] = 200$ nM and a dissociation constant of $K_d = 50$ nM.\n\nThe first step is to determine the fraction of $\\beta$-tubulin sites occupied by albendazole.

We can write this relationship as $v = c[T]$, where $c$ is a constant of proportionality.\nThe baseline velocity, $v_0$, occurs in the absence of the drug (i.e., $[D] = 0$). In this no-drug condition, all tubulin is free, so the concentration of free tubulin is $[T]_{\\text{total}}$. Thus, the baseline velocity is $v_0 = c[T]_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe normalized polymerization velocity is the ratio of the velocity with the drug to the baseline velocity without the drug:\n$$ \\text{Normalized Velocity} = \\frac{v}{v_0} = \\frac{c[T]}{c[T]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[T]}{[T]_{\\text{total}}} $$\nThis ratio is the fraction of $\\beta$-tubulin that is free (unbound).
