It is a valid quantitative problem in biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem is divided into two parts: first, deriving the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ and evaluating it; second, using this result to compute the expected change in leakage current $\\Delta I$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Evaluation of Fractional Occupancy $\\theta$**\n\nThe fractional occupancy $\\theta$ is defined as the ratio of the concentration of drug-bound sites, $[DR]$, to the total concentration of available sites, $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$\n\\theta \\equiv \\frac{[DR]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nThe total concentration of sites is the sum of unoccupied sites, $[R]$, and occupied sites, $[DR]$:\n$$\n[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R] + [DR]\n$$\nFrom this conservation relation, we can express the concentration of unoccupied sites as:\n$$\n[R] = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [DR]\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the equilibrium condition of the binding reaction:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{[D][R]}{[DR]}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[R]$ into the definition of $K_D$:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{[D]([R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [DR])}{[DR]}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation to isolate the term $\\frac{[DR]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$.\n$$\nK_{D}[DR] = [D][R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [D][DR]\n$$\n$$\nK_{D}[DR] + [D][DR] = [D][R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\n$$\n[DR](K_{D} + [D]) = [D][R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nDividing both sides by $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and by $(K_{D} + [D])$ yields the expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$\n\\frac{[DR]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{[D]}{[D] + K_{D}}\n$$\nThus,\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[D]}{[D] + K_{D}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for fractional occupancy as a function of $[D]$ and $K_{D}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\theta$ for the given values $[D] = 0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_{D} = 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{0.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M} + 0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Expected Change in Leakage Current $\\Delta I$**\n\nThe total current, $I_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the baseline current, $I_{\\mathrm{base}}$, and the current induced by the amphotericin B pores, $I_{\\mathrm{pore}}$.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{total}} = I_{\\mathrm{base}} + I_{\\mathrm{pore}}\n$$\nThe change in leakage current, $\\Delta I$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta I = I_{\\mathrm{total}} - I_{\\mathrm{base}} = I_{\\mathrm{pore}}\n$$\nThe current through the pores is given by $I_{\\mathrm{pore}} = n_{\\mathrm{open}}\\,\\gamma\\,V$, where $n_{\\mathrm{open}}$ is the number of open pores. We need to find the *expected* number of open pores, $\\langle n_{\\mathrm{open}} \\rangle$.\n\nThe total number of potential pore sites is $N_s$. The probability of any given site being occupied by a drug molecule is the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$. Thus, the expected number of drug-bound sites is $N_s \\theta$.\nGiven that a site is occupied, the probability of it forming an open, conducting pore is $p$. Therefore, the expected number of open pores is the product of the expected number of bound sites and the probability $p$:\n$$\n\\langle n_{\\mathrm{open}} \\rangle = (N_s \\theta) \\cdot p = N_s p \\theta\n$$\nThe expected change in leakage current is then:\n$$\n\\Delta I = \\langle n_{\\mathrm{open}} \\rangle \\gamma V = N_s p \\theta \\gamma V\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Delta I = N_s p \\gamma V \\left( \\frac{[D]}{[D] + K_D} \\right)\n$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $N_s = 120$\n-   $p = 0.6$\n-   $\\gamma = 200\\,\\mathrm{pS} = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n-   $V = 50\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $\\theta = 5/6$ (as calculated previously)\n\nFirst, let's calculate the expected number of open pores:\n$$\n\\langle n_{\\mathrm{open}} \\rangle = N_s p \\theta = 120 \\times 0.6 \\times \\frac{5}{6} = (120/6) \\times 0.6 \\times 5 = 20 \\times 0.6 \\times 5 = 60\n$$\nSo, we expect $60$ pores to be open on average.\n\nNext, we calculate the current through a single open pore, $I_{\\mathrm{single}}$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{single}} = \\gamma V = (200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 10000 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 10 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A} = 10\\,\\mathrm{pA}\n$$\nThe total expected change in current is the product of the expected number of open pores and the single-pore current:\n$$\n\\Delta I = \\langle n_{\\mathrm{open}} \\rangle \\times I_{\\mathrm{single}} = 60 \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{pA} = 600\\,\\mathrm{pA}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in nanoamperes ($\\mathrm{nA}$). Using the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{nA} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{pA}$:\n$$\n\\Delta I = 600\\,\\mathrm{pA} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{nA}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{pA}} = 0.6\\,\\mathrm{nA}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures gives $0.600\\,\\mathrm{nA}$.",
