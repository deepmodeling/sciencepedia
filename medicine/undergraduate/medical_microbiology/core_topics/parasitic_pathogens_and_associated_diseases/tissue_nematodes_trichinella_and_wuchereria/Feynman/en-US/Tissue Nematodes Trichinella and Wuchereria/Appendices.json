            "introduction": "A cornerstone of public health strategy against trichinellosis is preventing infection at its source: the consumption of contaminated meat. This is achieved by ensuring that meat is cooked to a temperature sufficient to kill any encysted *Trichinella* larvae. This hands-on practice explores the quantitative side of food safety by modeling the thermal inactivation of larvae. By applying the principles of first-order death kinetics, you will calculate the specific time required at a given temperature to ensure the parasite is rendered non-viable, providing a robust, science-based foundation for safe cooking guidelines .",

            "problem": "A batch of pork is suspected to harbor viable encysted larvae of Trichinella spiralis. To ensure food safety by cooking, the core of the meat is held isothermally at $71^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Assume that thermal inactivation of viable Trichinella larvae at a fixed temperature follows first-order death kinetics, so that the viable count $N(t)$ satisfies the ordinary differential equation $\\frac{dN}{dt}=-k\\,N$ with a constant rate parameter $k$ at that temperature. A $5\\log_{10}$ reduction means that the surviving fraction satisfies $\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}=10^{-5}$. At $71^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, an experimentally determined rate constant is $k=0.8\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Using only these assumptions and definitions, derive an expression for the holding time $t$ needed to achieve a $5\\log_{10}$ reduction, then evaluate it numerically for $k=0.8\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem describes the thermal inactivation of *Trichinella spiralis* larvae, which is stated to follow first-order death kinetics. The governing ordinary differential equation for the viable count $N$ as a function of time $t$ is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k N\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant rate parameter at a fixed temperature. This is a first-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients. It is also separable.\n\nTo find the relationship between the viable count and time, we can separate the variables and integrate. We arrange the equation so that terms involving $N$ are on one side and terms involving $t$ are on the other:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The viable count changes from an initial count $N(0)$ at time $t=0$ to a count $N(t)$ at a later time $t$. The corresponding definite integrals are:\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(N')]_{N(0)}^{N(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N(0)) = -k(t) - (-k(0))\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -k t\n$$\nThis equation relates the surviving fraction of larvae, $\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}$, to the holding time $t$ and the rate constant $k$.\n\nThe problem requires determining the holding time $t$ needed to achieve a $5\\log_{10}$ reduction. A $5\\log_{10}$ reduction is defined as the state where the surviving fraction is $10^{-5}$. Thus, we set:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)} = 10^{-5}\n$$\nSubstituting this condition into our integrated rate equation:\n$$\n\\ln(10^{-5}) = -k t\n$$\nWe use the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(x^y) = y\\ln(x)$, to simplify the left-hand side:\n$$\n-5 \\ln(10) = -k t\n$$\nNow, we solve for the holding time $t$. Dividing both sides by $-k$ (assuming $k \\neq 0$, which must be true for any inactivation process), we obtain the symbolic expression for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{5 \\ln(10)}{k}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the time required to achieve a $5\\log_{10}$ reduction for any first-order process with rate constant $k$.\n\nThe problem provides the numerical value for the rate constant at $71^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ as $k = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. We substitute this value into our expression for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{5 \\ln(10)}{0.8} \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically. The natural logarithm of $10$ is approximately $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$.\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{5 \\times 2.302585}{0.8} \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{11.512925}{0.8} \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\n$$\nt \\approx 14.39115625 \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $4$, $3$, and $9$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\nt \\approx 14.39 \\, \\mathrm{min}\n$$",
