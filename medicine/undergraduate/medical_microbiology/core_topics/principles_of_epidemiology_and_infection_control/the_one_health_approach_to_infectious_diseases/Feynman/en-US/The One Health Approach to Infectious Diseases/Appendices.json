Assume standard Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered dynamics where infectious individuals recover at per-capita rates $\\gamma_{H}$ and $\\gamma_{L}$, and new infections arise via effective contacts characterized by transmission coefficients $\\beta_{ij}$ from infectious individuals in population $j \\in \\{H,L\\}$ to susceptible individuals in population $i \\in \\{H,L\\}$. Heterogeneous interspecies and intraspecies mixing is represented by dimensionless contact scaling factors $c_{ij}$ that modulate the effective contact rate between populations $i$ and $j$.\n\nAt the disease-free equilibrium, take the following empirically plausible parameters (per day for rates):\n- Human recovery rate: $\\gamma_{H} = 0.2$.\n- Livestock recovery rate: $\\gamma_{L} = 0.1$.\n- Human-to-human transmission coefficient: $\\beta_{HH} = 0.18$.\n- Livestock-to-human transmission coefficient: $\\beta_{HL} = 0.06$.\n- Human-to-livestock transmission coefficient: $\\beta_{LH} = 0.10$.\n- Livestock-to-livestock transmission coefficient: $\\beta_{LL} = 0.12$.\n- Contact scaling factors: $c_{HH} = 1.0$, $c_{HL} = 0.6$, $c_{LH} = 0.4$, $c_{LL} = 1.2$.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions that the basic reproduction number $R_0$ for a multi-host system equals the dominant eigenvalue (spectral radius) of the next-generation operator that maps infectious individuals to their expected secondary infections at the disease-free state, construct the appropriate $2 \\times 2$ next-generation matrix from the provided parameters and compute $R_0$ for the coupled human–livestock system.

The value of $R_0$ is defined as the dominant eigenvalue (spectral radius) of the next-generation matrix (NGM).\n\nFirst, we must construct the $2 \\times 2$ next-generation matrix, let's call it $K$. The element $K_{ij}$ of this matrix represents the average number of new infections in population $i$ generated by a single infectious individual from population $j$ over their entire infectious period, assuming the population $i$ is entirely susceptible. This is calculated as the product of the per-capita rate at which an infectious individual in population $j$ infects individuals in population $i$, and the average duration of the infectious period for an individual in population $j$.\n\nThe effective transmission rate from population $j$ to population $i$ is $c_{ij}\\beta_{ij}$, and the average infectious duration in population $j$ is $1/\\gamma_j$.\nThe matrix elements $K_{ij}$ are thus defined as:\n$$ K_{ij} = \\frac{c_{ij}\\beta_{ij}}{\\gamma_j} $$\nThe next-generation matrix $K$ is therefore:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} K_{HH} & K_{HL} \\\\ K_{LH} & K_{LL} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{c_{HH}\\beta_{HH}}{\\gamma_H} & \\frac{c_{HL}\\beta_{HL}}{\\gamma_L} \\\\ \\frac{c_{LH}\\beta_{LH}}{\\gamma_H} & \\frac{c_{LL}\\beta_{LL}}{\\gamma_L} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, substitute the given numerical values into the matrix elements:\n- $K_{HH} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 0.18}{0.2} = 0.9$\n- $K_{HL} = \\frac{0.6 \\times 0.06}{0.1} = 0.36$\n- $K_{LH} = \\frac{0.4 \\times 0.10}{0.2} = 0.2$\n- $K_{LL} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 0.12}{0.1} = 1.44$\n\nThus, the numerical next-generation matrix is:\n$$ K = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.9 & 0.36 \\\\ 0.2 & 1.44 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the dominant eigenvalue of $K$.
