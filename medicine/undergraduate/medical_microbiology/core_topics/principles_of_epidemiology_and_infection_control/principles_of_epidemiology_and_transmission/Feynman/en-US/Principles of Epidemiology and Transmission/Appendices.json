            "problem": "A hospital laboratory evaluates a new rapid antigen detection assay for a respiratory pathogen using a reference standard of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). In a validation cohort, the assay is applied to two groups identified by the reference standard: the first group consists of $180$ individuals with confirmed infection, of whom $168$ return a positive assay result; the second group consists of $220$ individuals confirmed uninfected, of whom $198$ return a negative assay result. Subsequently, the assay is planned for use in a community screening program where the infection prevalence is known to be $P = 0.15$.\n\nStarting from the foundational epidemiologic definitions that sensitivity is the conditional probability $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$, specificity is the conditional probability $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, and prevalence is the marginal probability $P(\\text{disease})$, first derive expressions for sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$ in terms of observed counts in the validation cohort.

The scenario of validating a diagnostic test is a routine and fundamental task in medical science. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data for the derivations and calculations. The data are internally consistent (e.g., $168 \\leq 180$ and $198 \\leq 220$). The language is objective and the terms are formally defined. The problem is complete and non-contradictory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease and $\\bar{D}$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution:\n1.  Derivation of expressions for sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$) from the validation cohort data.\n2.  Derivation of analytic expressions for the positive predictive value ($PPV$) and negative predictive value ($NPV$) in terms of prevalence ($P$), $Se$, and $Sp$.\n3.  Computation of the numerical values for $Se$, $Sp$, $PPV$, and $NPV$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Sensitivity ($Se$) and Specificity ($Sp$)**\n\nFrom the validation cohort data, we can define the counts of true positives ($TP$), true negatives ($TN$), false positives ($FP$), and false negatives ($FN$).\n- True Positives ($TP$): The number of diseased individuals who test positive. We are given $TP = 168$.\n- False Negatives ($FN$): The number of diseased individuals who test negative. This is the total number of diseased individuals minus the true positives. $FN = N_D - TP = 180 - 168 = 12$.\n- True Negatives ($TN$): The number of non-diseased individuals who test negative. We are given $TN = 198$.\n- False Positives ($FP$): The number of non-diseased individuals who test positive. This is the total number of non-diseased individuals minus the true negatives. $FP = N_{\\bar{D}} - TN = 220 - 198 = 22$.\n\nSensitivity, $Se$, is the conditional probability of a positive test given the presence of disease, $P(T^+ \\mid D)$. This probability is estimated from the validation data as the proportion of diseased individuals who tested positive.\n$$Se = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Total Number with Disease}} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$\nSpecificity, $Sp$, is the conditional probability of a negative test given the absence of disease, $P(T^- \\mid \\bar{D})$. This is estimated as the proportion of non-diseased individuals who tested negative.\n$$Sp = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Number without Disease}} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}$$\nThese are the required expressions in terms of observed counts.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)**\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $PPV = P(D \\mid T^+)$, is the conditional probability of having the disease given a positive test result. We use Bayes' theorem to derive its expression:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe term $P(D)$ is the prevalence, given as $P$. The term $P(T^+ \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$. The denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the marginal probability of a positive test, which can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D)P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid \\bar{D})P(\\bar{D})$$\nWe have $P(D) = P$ and $P(\\bar{D}) = 1 - P$. We know $P(T^+ \\mid D) = Se$. The term $P(T^+ \\mid \\bar{D})$ is the false positive rate, which is related to specificity by $P(T^+ \\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid \\bar{D}) = 1 - Sp$.\nSubstituting these into the expansion for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(P) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P}{Se \\cdot P + (1 - Sp)(1 - P)}$$\nThe Negative Predictive Value, $NPV = P(\\bar{D} \\mid T^-)$, is the conditional probability of not having the disease given a negative test result. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(\\bar{D} \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid \\bar{D}) P(\\bar{D})}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe term $P(\\bar{D}) = 1 - P$. The term $P(T^- \\mid \\bar{D})$ is the specificity, $Sp$. The denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the marginal probability of a negative test, expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- \\mid \\bar{D})P(\\bar{D}) + P(T^- \\mid D)P(D)$$\nThe term $P(T^- \\mid D)$ is the false negative rate, which is related to sensitivity by $P(T^- \\mid D) = 1 - P(T^+ \\mid D) = 1 - Se$.\nSubstituting these into the expansion for $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp)(1 - P) + (1 - Se)(P)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - P)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - P) + (1 - Se)P}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation**\n\nFirst, we compute the values for $Se$ and $Sp$ from the validation cohort data.\n$$Se = \\frac{168}{180} = \\frac{14}{15} \\approx 0.933333...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $Se = 0.9333$.\n$$Sp = \\frac{198}{220} = \\frac{9}{10} = 0.9$$\nExpressed to four significant figures, $Sp = 0.9000$.\n\nNext, we compute $PPV$ and $NPV$ for the community screening program where the prevalence is $P = 0.15$. Consequently, $1 - P = 0.85$.\nUsing the derived formulas and the calculated values of $Se$ and $Sp$:\nFor $PPV$, we use $Se = \\frac{14}{15}$ and $Sp = \\frac{9}{10}$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(\\frac{14}{15}) \\cdot 0.15}{(\\frac{14}{15}) \\cdot 0.15 + (1 - \\frac{9}{10})(1 - 0.15)} = \\frac{\\frac{14}{15} \\cdot \\frac{15}{100}}{\\frac{14}{15} \\cdot \\frac{15}{100} + (\\frac{1}{10})(0.85)} = \\frac{\\frac{14}{100}}{\\frac{14}{100} + \\frac{8.5}{100}} = \\frac{0.14}{0.14 + 0.085} = \\frac{0.140}{0.225}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{140}{225} = \\frac{28}{45} \\approx 0.622222...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.6222$.\n\nFor $NPV$, we use $Se = \\frac{14}{15}$ and $Sp = \\frac{9}{10}$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{\\frac{9}{10} \\cdot (1 - 0.15)}{\\frac{9}{10} \\cdot (1 - 0.15) + (1 - \\frac{14}{15}) \\cdot 0.15} = \\frac{0.9 \\cdot 0.85}{0.9 \\cdot 0.85 + (\\frac{1}{15})(0.15)} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + (\\frac{1}{15}) \\frac{15}{100}} = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + \\frac{1}{100}}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.765}{0.765 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.765}{0.775} = \\frac{765}{775} = \\frac{153}{155} \\approx 0.987096...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9871$.\n\nThe four computed numerical values are:\n- Sensitivity ($Se$): $0.9333$\n- Specificity ($Sp$): $0.9000$\n- Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$): $0.6222$\n- Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$): $0.9871$\nThese values are presented in the final answer as a row matrix in the order ($Se$, $Sp$, $PPV$, $NPV$).",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of mathematical epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objectively stated. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address each in sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $R_t$.\n\nThe problem states that the daily incidence, $I_t$, follows a Poisson distribution. The parameter of this distribution, its mean $\\lambda_t$, is given by the renewal equation:\n$$\n\\lambda_t = R_t \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{\\infty} I_{t-\\tau} g(\\tau)\n$$\nWe are asked to define $\\Lambda_t = \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{\\infty} I_{t-\\tau} g(\\tau)$, which represents the total infectiousness produced by previously infected individuals, weighted by the generation interval distribution $g(\\tau)$. With this definition, the mean of the Poisson distribution becomes $\\lambda_t = R_t \\Lambda_t$.\n\nThe number of new cases at time $t$, denoted $I_t$, is thus a random variable drawn from a Poisson distribution with this mean:\n$$\nI_t \\sim \\text{Poisson}(R_t \\Lambda_t)\n$$\nThe likelihood function, $L(R_t)$, for the single observation of incidence $I_t$ at time $t$, is given by the probability mass function (PMF) of the Poisson distribution evaluated at $I_t$:\n$$\nL(R_t; I_t, \\Lambda_t) = \\frac{(\\lambda_t)^{I_t} \\exp(-\\lambda_t)}{I_t!} = \\frac{(R_t \\Lambda_t)^{I_t} \\exp(-R_t \\Lambda_t)}{I_t!}\n$$\nTo find the MLE, it is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(R_t) = \\ln(L(R_t))$:\n$$\n\\ell(R_t) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{(R_t \\Lambda_t)^{I_t} \\exp(-R_t \\Lambda_t)}{I_t!} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ell(R_t) = \\ln((R_t \\Lambda_t)^{I_t}) - \\ln(\\exp(R_t \\Lambda_t)) - \\ln(I_t!)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(R_t) = I_t \\ln(R_t \\Lambda_t) - R_t \\Lambda_t - \\ln(I_t!)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(R_t) = I_t (\\ln(R_t) + \\ln(\\Lambda_t)) - R_t \\Lambda_t - \\ln(I_t!)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(R_t) = I_t \\ln(R_t) + I_t \\ln(\\Lambda_t) - R_t \\Lambda_t - \\ln(I_t!)\n$$\nTo find the value of $R_t$ that maximizes this function, we take the first derivative of $\\ell(R_t)$ with respect to $R_t$ and set it to zero. In this differentiation, $I_t$ and $\\Lambda_t$ are treated as constants, as $\\Lambda_t$ depends on past incidence data, not on $R_t$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell(R_t)}{dR_t} = \\frac{d}{dR_t} \\left( I_t \\ln(R_t) + I_t \\ln(\\Lambda_t) - R_t \\Lambda_t - \\ln(I_t!) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell(R_t)}{dR_t} = \\frac{I_t}{R_t} + 0 - \\Lambda_t - 0 = \\frac{I_t}{R_t} - \\Lambda_t\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the equation for the MLE, which we denote $\\hat{R}_t$:\n$$\n\\frac{I_t}{\\hat{R}_t} - \\Lambda_t = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{I_t}{\\hat{R}_t} = \\Lambda_t\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{R}_t$, we obtain the MLE:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_t = \\frac{I_t}{\\Lambda_t}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\Lambda_t$, the full expression is:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_t = \\frac{I_t}{\\sum_{\\tau=1}^{\\infty} I_{t-\\tau} g(\\tau)}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\ell(R_t)}{dR_t^2} = \\frac{d}{dR_t} \\left( \\frac{I_t}{R_t} - \\Lambda_t \\right) = -\\frac{I_t}{R_t^2}\n$$\nSince incidence $I_t$ must be non-negative ($I_t \\ge 0$) and $R_t$ must be positive ($R_t  0$), the second derivative is non-positive. For any $I_t  0$, it is strictly negative, confirming that our solution corresponds to a maximum of the likelihood function.\n\nPart 2: Numerical Calculation of the MLE for $R_t$.\n\nWe are given the following data:\nThe generation interval distribution is $g(1) = 0.5$, $g(2) = 0.3$, $g(3) = 0.2$, and $g(\\tau) = 0$ for all $\\tau \\ge 4$.\nThe incidence data are $I_{t-1} = 18$, $I_{t-2} = 12$, $I_{t-3} = 9$, and $I_t = 17$.\n\nFirst, we compute the total infectiousness, $\\Lambda_t$. Since $g(\\tau)=0$ for $\\tau \\ge 4$, the infinite sum truncates after $\\tau=3$:\n$$\n\\Lambda_t = \\sum_{\\tau=1}^{3} I_{t-\\tau} g(\\tau) = I_{t-1} g(1) + I_{t-2} g(2) + I_{t-3} g(3)\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\Lambda_t = (18)(0.5) + (12)(0.3) + (9)(0.2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda_t = 9.0 + 3.6 + 1.8 = 14.4\n$$\nNow, we use the MLE formula derived in Part 1 to compute $\\hat{R}_t$:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_t = \\frac{I_t}{\\Lambda_t}\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $I_t$ and the calculated $\\Lambda_t$:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_t = \\frac{17}{14.4} \\approx 1.180555...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $5$, so we round up.\n$$\n\\hat{R}_t \\approx 1.181\n$$\n\nPart 3: Overdispersion and the Negative Binomial Model.\n\nThe Poisson distribution has a defining property that its mean is equal to its variance, i.e., $E[I_t] = \\text{Var}(I_t) = \\lambda_t$. Overdispersion is the phenomenon observed in many real-world count datasets where the sample variance is significantly larger than the sample mean. This violates the Poisson assumption.\n\nOne standard way to correct for overdispersion is to replace the Poisson observation model with a Negative Binomial (NB) model. The NB distribution has two parameters and allows the variance to be greater than the mean. A common parameterization is in terms of a mean $\\mu$ and an overdispersion parameter $\\phi  0$, such that the variance is given by $\\text{Var}(I_t) = \\mu + \\phi \\mu^2$. As $\\phi \\to 0$, the NB distribution converges to the Poisson distribution.\n\nTo apply this to our problem, we would model $I_t$ as:\n$$\nI_t \\sim \\text{NB}(\\mu_t, \\phi)\n$$\nwhere the mean $\\mu_t$ is specified by the same renewal process model, $\\mu_t = R_t \\Lambda_t$. The problem asks if this change affects the MLE for $R_t$ under the assumption of a *fixed* overdispersion parameter $\\phi$.\n\nTo determine this, we examine the MLE for the mean parameter of the NB distribution. For a single observation $y$ from a NB distribution with mean $\\mu$ and fixed size parameter $k = 1/\\phi$, the log-likelihood is $\\ell_{NB}(\\mu) = \\ln(f(y; \\mu, k))$. The derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to the mean $\\mu$ is $\\frac{\\partial \\ell_{NB}}{\\partial \\mu} = \\frac{y-\\mu}{\\mu(1+\\mu/k)}$. Setting this score function to zero to find the MLE for the mean, $\\hat{\\mu}$, yields:\n$$\n\\frac{y - \\hat{\\mu}}{\\hat{\\mu}(1+\\hat{\\mu}/k)} = 0 \\implies y - \\hat{\\mu} = 0 \\implies \\hat{\\mu} = y\n$$\nHence, for a single observation, the MLE of the mean of an NB distribution (with a fixed dispersion parameter) is simply the observation itself. In our case, with the single observation $I_t$, the MLE for the mean $\\mu_t$ is $\\hat{\\mu}_t = I_t$.\n\nThis result is identical to the MLE for the mean of a Poisson distribution, which is also the observation itself. Since in both models the mean is related to $R_t$ by the same equation ($\\mu_t = R_t \\Lambda_t$), and the MLE for the mean is the same ($\\hat{\\mu}_t = I_t$), the resulting MLE for $R_t$ must also be the same. Setting $\\hat{\\mu}_t = \\hat{R}_t \\Lambda_t$ and using $\\hat{\\mu}_t = I_t$, we get:\n$$\nI_t = \\hat{R}_t \\Lambda_t \\implies \\hat{R}_t = \\frac{I_t}{\\Lambda_t}\n$$\nTherefore, under the condition that the overdispersion parameter $\\phi$ is fixed and known, replacing the Poisson observation model with a Negative Binomial model does *not* change the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for $R_t$. The estimator remains the ratio of the current incidence to the total past infectiousness.",

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep analysis of a binomial transmission process. Let $p$ represent the secondary attack rate (SAR), which is the probability that a given susceptible contact becomes infected. Let $N$ be the total number of susceptible contacts and $k$ be the number of contacts who become infected.\n\nUnder the assumptions of homogeneous exposure and independent outcomes, the number of secondary infections, $k$, among $N$ susceptible individuals can be modeled as a random variable following a binomial distribution, $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$P(k|N, p) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nThis function, when viewed as a function of the parameter $p$ for observed data $(k, N)$, is the likelihood function, $L(p|k, N)$.\n\nThe first task is to derive the point estimator for the SAR. The standard approach is maximum likelihood estimation. We find the value of $p$ that maximizes the likelihood function. It is often more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ln L(p|k, N)$:\n$$\\ln L(p|k, N) = \\ln\\binom{N}{k} + k\\ln(p) + (N-k)\\ln(1-p)$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative with respect to $p$ and set it to zero:\n$$\\frac{d}{dp}\\ln L(p|k, N) = \\frac{k}{p} - \\frac{N-k}{1-p} = 0$$\nSolving for $p$ yields the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), denoted as $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\\frac{k}{\\hat{p}} = \\frac{N-k}{1-\\hat{p}} \\implies k(1-\\hat{p}) = \\hat{p}(N-k) \\implies k - k\\hat{p} = N\\hat{p} - k\\hat{p} \\implies k = N\\hat{p}$$\n$$\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{N}$$\nThe probabilistic basis for this estimator is that it is the value for the SAR that makes the observed outcome ( $k$ infections among $N$ contacts) most probable. For the given data, $N=120$ and $k=36$, the MLE for the SAR is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{36}{120} = 0.3$.\n\nNext, we address the Bayesian formulation. We are asked to use a Beta distribution as the prior for $p$. Let the prior distribution be $p \\sim \\text{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, with the probability density function (PDF):\n$$f(p; \\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{p^{\\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\\beta-1}}{B(\\alpha, \\beta)}$$\nwhere $B(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the Beta function. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$f(p|k, N, \\alpha, \\beta) \\propto P(k|N, p) \\times f(p; \\alpha, \\beta)$$\n$$f(p|k, N, \\alpha, \\beta) \\propto \\left[p^k (1-p)^{N-k}\\right] \\times \\left[p^{\\alpha-1}(1-p)^{\\beta-1}\\right]$$\n$$f(p|k, N, \\alpha, \\beta) \\propto p^{k+\\alpha-1}(1-p)^{N-k+\\beta-1}$$\nThis resulting functional form is the kernel of a Beta distribution. Thus, the posterior distribution for $p$ is also a Beta distribution:\n$$p|k, N \\sim \\text{Beta}(k+\\alpha, N-k+\\beta)$$\nThis demonstrates that the Beta distribution is a conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood. A $95\\%$ equal-tailed credible interval for $p$ is an interval $(p_L, p_U)$ such that $P(p  p_L | k, N) = 0.025$ and $P(p  p_U | k, N) = 0.025$. These bounds correspond to the $2.5^{th}$ and $97.5^{th}$ percentiles of the posterior distribution. The general form of this interval is:\n$$(p_L, p_U) = (F^{-1}_{\\text{Beta}}(0.025; k+\\alpha, N-k+\\beta), F^{-1}_{\\text{Beta}}(0.975; k+\\alpha, N-k+\\beta))$$\nwhere $F^{-1}_{\\text{Beta}}$ is the quantile function (inverse CDF) of the Beta distribution with the specified posterior parameters.\n\nIndependently, we derive the score-test-based (Wilson) $95\\%$ confidence interval. This interval is derived by inverting the score test for a proportion. The score test statistic for the null hypothesis $H_0: p = p_0$ is:\n$$Z = \\frac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p_0(1-p_0)}{N}}}$$\nThe $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval consists of all values $p_0$ for which we do not reject $H_0$ at significance level $\\alpha$. This corresponds to the set of $p_0$ values for which $|Z| \\le z_{\\alpha/2}$, or $Z^2 \\le z_{\\alpha/2}^2$. For a $95\\%$ interval, $\\alpha=0.05$ and $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025}$.\nLet $p$ be the parameter and $z = z_{\\alpha/2}$. The equation to solve for the interval endpoints is:\n$$(\\hat{p} - p)^2 = z^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{N}$$\n$$N(\\hat{p}^2 - 2\\hat{p}p + p^2) = z^2(p - p^2)$$\nRearranging this into a quadratic equation of the form $Ap^2 + Bp + C = 0$:\n$$(N+z^2)p^2 - (2N\\hat{p} + z^2)p + N\\hat{p}^2 = 0$$\nDividing by $N$ gives:\n$$\\left(1+\\frac{z^2}{N}\\right)p^2 - \\left(2\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{N}\\right)p + \\hat{p}^2 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula $p = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2-4AC}}{2A}$, with $A = 1+\\frac{z^2}{N}$, $B = -(2\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{N})$, and $C = \\hat{p}^2$, we obtain the endpoints of the interval:\n$$p = \\frac{\\left(2\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{N}\\right) \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(2\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{N}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(1+\\frac{z^2}{N}\\right)\\hat{p}^2}}{2\\left(1+\\frac{z^2}{N}\\right)}$$\nAfter algebraic simplification of the term under the square root, the expression for the interval is:\n$$p = \\frac{\\hat{p} + \\frac{z^2}{2N}}{1+\\frac{z^2}{N}} \\pm \\frac{z}{1+\\frac{z^2}{N}}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{N} + \\frac{z^2}{4N^2}}$$\n\nWe are asked to compute the Wilson $95\\%$ lower confidence limit using the provided data.\nThe given data are:\nNumber of susceptible contacts, $N = 120$.\nNumber of secondary infections, $k = 36$.\nThe sample proportion is $\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{N} = \\frac{36}{120} = 0.3$.\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, the significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$, and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.959964$.\nThe lower confidence limit, $p_L$, is given by:\n$$p_L = \\frac{\\hat{p} + \\frac{z_{0.025}^2}{2N} - z_{0.025}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{N} + \\frac{z_{0.025}^2}{4N^2}}}{1+\\frac{z_{0.025}^2}{N}}$$\nWe substitute the numerical values:\n$z_{0.025}^2 \\approx (1.959964)^2 \\approx 3.841459$.\nThe numerator is:\n$0.3 + \\frac{3.841459}{2(120)} - 1.959964\\sqrt{\\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{120} + \\frac{3.841459}{4(120)^2}}$\n$= 0.3 + \\frac{3.841459}{240} - 1.959964\\sqrt{\\frac{0.21}{120} + \\frac{3.841459}{57600}}$\n$= 0.3 + 0.016006 - 1.959964\\sqrt{0.00175 + 0.00006669}$\n$= 0.316006 - 1.959964\\sqrt{0.00181669}$\n$= 0.316006 - 1.959964(0.0426227)$\n$= 0.316006 - 0.083539$\n$= 0.232467$\nThe denominator is:\n$1 + \\frac{3.841459}{120} = 1 + 0.032012 = 1.032012$\nSo, the lower limit is:\n$$p_L = \\frac{0.232467}{1.032012} \\approx 0.2252561$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.2253$.",
