A wet mount with Calcofluor white (CFW) highlights oval cells showing narrow-based budding; multiple discrete budding scars are evident on individual cells.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Source**: Bloodstream isolate.\n- **Culture 1**: Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) incubated for $48$ hours at $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Macroscopic Morphology (Culture 1)**: Smooth, creamy, pasty, nonpigmented colonies.\n- **Microscopic Morphology (Culture 1)**: Wet mount with Calcofluor white (CFW) shows oval cells, narrow-based budding, and multiple discrete budding scars on individual cells.\n- **Culture 2**: Slide culture on cornmeal agar with Tween incubated at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ for $72$ hours.\n- **Microscopic Morphology (Culture 2)**: Lactophenol cotton blue (LPCB) preparation shows scant pseudohyphae.\n- **Negative Findings**: No true hyphae, no aerial hyphae, no conidiophores, no sporangia, no arthroconidia, and no septate hyphae observed in any preparation.\n- **Task**: To determine the most accurate classification (yeast vs. mold) and justification based on standardized morphological benchmarks in medical mycology.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is assessed against the required criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on the established principles and standard laboratory procedures of clinical mycology. The media (SDA, cornmeal agar with Tween), staining methods (CFW, LPCB), incubation conditions ($35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), and morphological terms (yeast, mold, budding, pseudohyphae, true hyphae, blastoconidia, arthroconidia) are all standard and factually correct within the discipline. The described findings are characteristic of a common clinical isolate, such as a *Candida* species.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a detailed and coherent set of macroscopic and microscopic observations. The question asks for a classification based directly on these observations, which is a standard diagnostic task in microbiology. The data are sufficient to arrive at a unique and logical conclusion.\n- **Objective**: The description of the fungal isolate is entirely objective and based on observable characteristics (e.g., \"smooth, creamy colonies,\" \"oval cells showing narrow-based budding\"). It is free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The combination of observations—creamy colonies, budding unicellular forms, presence of pseudohyphae, and the explicit absence of true hyphae and mold-specific structures—is internally consistent and points towards a specific morphological group. The use of two different temperatures is critical for assessing dimorphism, and the results from both are provided.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic. Isolating a fungus from a bloodstream (fungemia) and subjecting it to this battery of tests is a routine procedure in a clinical microbiology laboratory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formed question in medical mycology that is scientifically sound, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental distinction between yeasts and molds is based on their morphology.\n- **Yeasts** are unicellular fungi that typically reproduce asexually by budding or fission. Macroscopically, they form colonies that are moist, creamy, and opaque, similar in appearance to bacterial colonies. Microscopically, they are seen as individual round to oval cells. Some yeasts, under certain conditions, can form pseudohyphae, which are chains of elongated budding cells that remain attached.\n- **Molds** are filamentous fungi composed of a network of branching, thread-like structures called hyphae. A mass of hyphae is a mycelium. Molds typically have a fuzzy or cottony appearance due to the formation of aerial hyphae. They reproduce via spores (such as conidia) produced on specialized hyphal structures.\n\nThe problem describes an isolate with the following key features:\n1.  **Macroscopic Appearance**: At $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the colonies are \"smooth, creamy, pasty,\" which is the classic description of yeast colonies.\n2.  **Microscopic Appearance (Cellular level)**: The organism is composed of \"oval cells\" that reproduce by \"narrow-based budding,\" producing daughter cells known as blastoconidia. The presence of \"multiple discrete budding scars\" is also a hallmark of yeast cells. This is the definition of a unicellular yeast form.\n3.  **Filamentous Structures**: The problem explicitly states there are \"no true hyphae\" and \"no aerial hyphae.\" True hyphae are the fundamental structural unit of molds. The observation of \"scant pseudohyphae\" is significant; pseudohyphae are characteristic of many yeasts (e.g., *Candida*) and are distinct from the true hyphae of molds.\n4.  **Reproductive Structures**: The absence of mold-specific reproductive structures (\"conidiophores, sporangia, or arthroconidia\") further excludes a mold classification.\n5.  **Temperature Study**: The organism grows as a yeast (creamy colonies, budding cells) at $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. At $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, it does not convert to a mold form (as it still lacks true hyphae), but instead shows yeast cells and some pseudohyphae. This behavior rules out thermal dimorphism, where a fungus typically exists as a mold at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ and a yeast at $35-37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nBased on this comprehensive set of observations, the isolate consistently exhibits the characteristics of a yeast across all tested conditions. It is a unicellular, budding organism that forms yeast-like colonies and lacks the defining features of a mold (true hyphae and mold-type sporulation).\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Yeast form, because the isolate is unicellular with reproduction by budding producing blastoconidia and persistent budding scars, forms creamy colonies, and lacks true and aerial hyphae or hypha-derived conidiation.**\nThis option correctly classifies the organism as a yeast form. The justification provides a perfect summary of the evidence presented in the problem statement:\n- The isolate is unicellular and reproduces by budding (oval cells, budding, budding scars, forming blastoconidia).\n- It forms creamy colonies (the macroscopic description).\n- It lacks the defining features of a mold (no true hyphae, no aerial hyphae, no conidiation from hyphae).\nEvery part of this justification is directly supported by the givens.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Mold form, because the presence of conidia (blastoconidia) defines molds; the absence of aerial hyphae can occur in some molds under nutrient-rich conditions.**\nThis option is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed. While blastoconidia are technically a type of asexual conidium, their formation by budding from a single yeast cell is the defining characteristic of yeast reproduction, not mold reproduction. Molds produce conidia from specialized hyphae (conidiophores). The primary criterion for a mold is the presence of true hyphae, which are explicitly absent in this isolate. The claim that blastoconidia define molds is a fundamental misinterpretation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Dimorphic fungus in the mold phase, because growth at $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with creamy colonies indicates a temperature-dependent switch; the lack of aerial hyphae confirms the filamentous phase is present but suppressed.**\nThis option is incorrect. For a classic dimorphic pathogen, growth at $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ would yield the yeast phase, not the mold phase. The described growth at $35\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (creamy colonies, budding cells) *is* the yeast phase. Furthermore, incubation at $25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ failed to produce a mold phase (no true hyphae were observed), which contradicts the definition of a dimorphic fungus. The reasoning presented is illogical and factually backward.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Yeast-like mold (for example, Geotrichum species), because creamy colony texture is non-discriminatory, and hyphae with arthroconidia can be overlooked on routine mounts.**\nThis option is incorrect. A yeast-like mold, such as *Geotrichum*, is characterized by the formation of true hyphae that fragment into arthroconidia. The problem explicitly states that there are \"no true hyphae\" and \"no arthroconidia.\" The isolate's primary mode of reproduction is budding, which is not a feature of *Geotrichum*. Relying on the speculative argument that definitive features \"can be overlooked\" is unscientific; classification must be based on the evidence provided, not on what might be missing.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Yeast form only if a germ tube test is positive; without germ tube formation the organism cannot be classified morphologically as yeast.**\nThis option is incorrect. The germ tube test is a specific, rapid test for the presumptive identification of *Candida albicans* and *Candida dubliniensis*. It is not a criterion for classifying an organism as a yeast. The general classification of \"yeast\" is based on the primary morphological features of being a unicellular, budding fungus. Many well-known yeasts, such as *Candida tropicalis*, *Candida glabrata*, and *Cryptococcus neoformans*, are germ tube negative. This statement creates an invalid and false prerequisite for a fundamental morphological classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "A pathology lab is asked to evaluate tissue from two patients with suspected endemic mycoses. Patient 1 developed pneumonia after working in a dusty construction site in the desert Southwest. Patient 2 developed a verrucous cutaneous lesion and lung nodules after camping near river valleys in the Upper Midwest. Culture is deferred due to laboratory safety concerns. The lab will use routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), and Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stains.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n\n- Dimorphic fungi undergo temperature-dependent morphogenetic switching, with environmental forms at approximately $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (often hyphae with conidia) and parasitic tissue forms at approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (often yeast or specialized non-hyphal structures).\n- Fungal cell walls contain polysaccharides (including chitin and glucans) that can be oxidized to aldehydes; Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) uses periodic acid to oxidize vicinal diols to aldehydes and Schiff reagent to detect those aldehydes as a magenta reaction product, while Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) uses chromic acid oxidation and silver impregnation to reduce silver onto aldehyde-rich sites, rendering fungal walls black on a pale green background.\n- Mucicarmine specifically stains acidic mucopolysaccharide capsules (e.g., prominent in Cryptococcus) rather than generic fungal cell walls.\n- Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) highlights general tissue architecture but is less sensitive for detecting fungal cell wall polysaccharides than PAS or GMS.\n\nWhich option most accurately predicts the diagnostic tissue morphology and justifies the differential staining features for Coccidioides versus Blastomyces?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient 1 Scenario**: Develops pneumonia after working at a dusty construction site in the desert Southwest.\n-   **Patient 2 Scenario**: Develops a verrucous cutaneous lesion and lung nodules after camping near river valleys in the Upper Midwest.\n-   **Laboratory Methods**: Routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS), and Gomori methenamine silver (GMS) stains are used. Culture is deferred.\n-   **Fundamental Basis 1 (Dimorphism)**: Dimorphic fungi exhibit temperature-dependent morphology. At approximately $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (environment), they are often hyphae with conidia. At approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (parasitic tissue), they are often yeast or other specialized non-hyphal structures.\n-   **Fundamental Basis 2 (Fungal Stains)**: Fungal cell walls contain polysaccharides. PAS oxidizes vicinal diols to aldehydes, which Schiff reagent detects as a magenta product. GMS uses chromic acid oxidation followed by silver impregnation, reducing silver onto aldehyde-rich sites and staining fungal walls black.\n-   **Fundamental Basis 3 (Capsular Stain)**: Mucicarmine specifically stains acidic mucopolysaccharide capsules, typified by *Cryptococcus*. It does not stain generic fungal cell walls.\n-   **Fundamental Basis 4 (Routine Stain)**: H&E reveals general tissue architecture but is less sensitive for fungal detection than PAS or GMS.\n-   **Question**: Predict the diagnostic tissue morphology and justify the staining features for *Coccidioides* versus *Blastomyces*.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical vignettes for Patient 1 and Patient 2 are classic presentations of coccidioidomycosis (caused by *Coccidioides* spp.) and blastomycosis (caused by *Blastomyces dermatitidis*), respectively. The geographical distributions and clinical manifestations described are textbook examples for these endemic mycoses. The descriptions of the histological stains (H&E, PAS, GMS, mucicarmine) and the principle of thermal dimorphism are fundamental and accurate concepts in medical microbiology and pathology.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requires the application of the provided fundamental principles to deduce the expected findings for two specific pathogens strongly suggested by the clinical data. The question asks for the most accurate prediction among the given options, implying a single best answer can be derived.\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is objective, technical, and free from bias or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. The solution will proceed by deducing the expected findings and then evaluating each option.\n\n### Derivation of Expected Findings\n\nThe problem requires identifying the etiologic agents based on the clinical and epidemiological data, then predicting their microscopic appearance and staining characteristics in tissue based on the provided fundamental principles.\n\n1.  **Identification of Organisms**:\n    -   Patient 1: The combination of pneumonia and exposure to dust in the desert Southwest is pathognomonic for **coccidioidomycosis**, caused by *Coccidioides* species.\n    -   Patient 2: The triad of verrucous skin lesions, pulmonary involvement, and exposure to river valleys in the Upper Midwest is a classic presentation of **blastomycosis**, caused by *Blastomyces dermatitidis*.\n\n2.  **Prediction of Tissue Morphology and Staining**:\n\n    -   ***Coccidioides*** **species**:\n        -   **Morphology**: According to Principle 1, the tissue form at approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is a specialized, non-hyphal structure. For *Coccidioides*, this is not a yeast but a unique, large, thick-walled **spherule**. Mature spherules undergo internal cleavage to form numerous small **endospores**. Upon rupture, these endospores are released into the tissue. The size of mature spherules is substantial, typically ranging from $20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ to over $80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n        -   **Staining**:\n            -   **H&E** (Principle 4): Spherules may appear as large, circular structures with a variably staining wall. The internal endospores are often small and basophilic (blue). The sensitivity is lower than with special stains.\n            -   **PAS & GMS** (Principle 2): The polysaccharide-rich walls of the spherules and endospores are strongly stained. PAS will render them magenta, and GMS will render them black.\n            -   **Mucicarmine** (Principle 3): *Coccidioides* does not possess an acidic mucopolysaccharide capsule. Therefore, it will be negative with mucicarmine stain.\n\n    -   ***Blastomyces dermatitidis***:\n        -   **Morphology**: According to Principle 1, the tissue form at approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is a yeast. The yeast of *B. dermatitidis* is characteristically large (approximately $8$–$15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ in diameter), spherical, and thick-walled. Its pathognomonic feature is reproduction by a single **broad-based bud**.\n        -   **Staining**:\n            -   **H&E** (Principle 4): The yeast is often visible due to its thick, refractile wall, which may give a \"double-contoured\" appearance. The cytoplasm and nucleus will stain with hematoxylin.\n            -   **PAS & GMS** (Principle 2): The thick, polysaccharide-rich cell wall will stain intensely with PAS (magenta) and GMS (black), highlighting the yeast and its broad-based budding.\n            -   **Mucicarmine** (Principle 3): *B. dermatitidis* does not have a mucopolysaccharide capsule. Therefore, it will be negative with mucicarmine stain.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **Option A**:\n    -   *Coccidioides*: Described as \"large spherules measuring approximately $20$–$80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ that contain numerous endospores\". This is morphologically correct. States they are \"highlighted strongly by GMS (black) and PAS (magenta), while mucicarmine is negative\". This is correct based on staining principles.\n    -   *Blastomyces*: Described as \"thick-walled yeast measuring approximately $8$–$15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ with broad-based budding\". This is morphologically correct. States the walls are \"strongly positive on GMS and PAS, often showing a 'double-contoured' appearance on H&E, and mucicarmine is negative\". This is also entirely correct based on morphology and staining principles.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately describes all features for both organisms.\n\n-   **Option B**:\n    -   *Coccidioides*: Described as \"hyphae with arthroconidia at approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\". This is incorrect. This describes the environmental mold form ($25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$), not the tissue form ($37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). It also incorrectly claims it has a \"mucicarmine-positive capsule\".\n    -   *Blastomyces*: Described as \"small intracellular yeast measuring approximately $2$–$5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ with narrow-based budding\". This description fits *Histoplasma capsulatum*, not *Blastomyces dermatitidis*. The claim that they are \"GMS and PAS negative\" is fundamentally incorrect as these are fungal stains.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option C**:\n    -   Claims \"Both organisms are best visualized solely on H&E because PAS and GMS are non-specific\". This premise is false. Principle 4 states H&E is *less* sensitive, and Principle 2 details the specific reactions of PAS and GMS with fungal walls, making them the preferred stains.\n    -   *Coccidioides*: Describes \"$5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ coccobacillary bodies without internal structures\". This is morphologically incorrect; it misses the characteristic spherules.\n    -   *Blastomyces*: Correctly notes \"broad-based budding yeast\" but incorrectly claims it is \"mucicarmine positive\".\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **Option D**:\n    -   *Coccidioides*: Describes \"spherules measuring approximately $10$–$20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ but lacks endospores\". This describes immature spherules and misses the key diagnostic feature of large, endospore-containing mature forms. The claim that it \"stain strongly with mucicarmine and only weakly with silver\" is incorrect; it is mucicarmine-negative and stains strongly with GMS (silver).\n    -   *Blastomyces*: Described as \"hyphae in tissue at approximately $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\". This is incorrect. The typical tissue form is yeast. It also incorrectly claims \"PAS stains only Blastomyces but not Coccidioides\". PAS stains both.\n    -   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that presents a fully accurate description of the morphology and staining reactions for both *Coccidioides* and *Blastomyces* in tissue, consistent with the provided fundamental principles.",

We can combine the logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\ln\\left|\\frac{N}{K-N}\\right| = rt + C\n$$\nSince the population $N$ starts at $N_0 < K$ and approaches $K$ from below, both $N$ and $K-N$ are positive for all $t \\ge 0$. We can thus drop the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\frac{N}{K-N} = \\exp(rt+C) = \\exp(C)\\exp(rt)\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $N(0)=N_0$ to determine the constant $\\exp(C)$.\n$$\n\\frac{N_0}{K-N_0} = \\exp(C)\\exp(0) \\implies \\exp(C) = \\frac{N_0}{K-N_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{K-N(t)} = \\frac{N_0}{K-N_0}\\exp(rt)\n$$\nTo solve for $N(t)$, we can invert the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{K-N(t)}{N(t)} = \\frac{K}{N(t)} - 1 = \\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}\\exp(-rt)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{K}{N(t)} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}\\right)\\exp(-rt) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{K}{N_0}-1\\right)\\exp(-rt)\n$$\nFinally, inverting to find $N(t)$ yields the closed-form solution:\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{K}{1 + \\left(\\frac{K}{N_0}-1\\right)\\exp(-rt)}\n$$\nThis can be written in an alternative, but equivalent, form by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $N_0\\exp(rt)$:\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{KN_0\\exp(rt)}{N_0\\exp(rt) + (K-N_0)} = \\frac{KN_0}{N_0 + (K-N_0)\\exp(-rt)}\n$$\nThis is the required solution for Part 1.\n\n### Part 2: Fitting the parameter $r$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$N_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$\n$K = 1.00 \\times 10^{7}$\n$N(4) = 8.0 \\times 10^{5}$ at $t=4$ h.\n$N(8) = 4.28 \\times 10^{6}$ at $t=8$ h.\n\nTo find $r$, we can rearrange the solution from Part 1. Let's start from the form $\\frac{N(t)}{K-N(t)} = \\frac{N_0}{K-N_0}\\exp(rt)$.\nSolving for $r$ gives:\n$$\n\\exp(rt) = \\frac{N(t)(K-N_0)}{N_0(K-N(t))}\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{t}\\ln\\left[\\frac{N(t)(K-N_0)}{N_0(K-N(t))}\\right]\n$$\nLet's use the data point at $t=4$ h:\n$N_0 = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$\n$K = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}$\n$t = 4$\n$N(4) = 8.0 \\times 10^{5}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ratios and differences:\n$\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7} - 1.0 \\times 10^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{9.9 \\times 10^{6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{5}} = 99$.\n$\\frac{N(4)}{K-N(4)} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5}}{1.0 \\times 10^{7} - 8.0 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{8.0 \\times 10^{5}}{9.2 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{8}{92} = \\frac{2}{23}$.\n\nUsing the rearranged equation for $\\exp(rt)$:\n$\\exp(4r) = \\frac{N(4)(K-N_0)}{N_0(K-N(4))} = \\left(\\frac{N(4)}{K-N(4)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2}{23}\\right)(99) = \\frac{198}{23}$.\nSolving for $r$:\n$$\n4r = \\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)\n$$\nAs a check, we can verify this with the second data point at $t=8$ h:\n$N(8) = 4.28 \\times 10^{6}$.\n$\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0} = 99$.\n$\\frac{N(8)}{K-N(8)} = \\frac{4.28 \\times 10^{6}}{1.00 \\times 10^{7} - 4.28 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{4.28 \\times 10^{6}}{5.72 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{4.28}{5.72} \\approx 0.74825$.\n$\\exp(8r) = \\left(\\frac{4.28}{5.72}\\right)(99) \\approx 74.077$.\n$8r \\approx \\ln(74.077) \\approx 4.305$.\n$r \\approx \\frac{4.305}{8} \\approx 0.5381$ h$^{-1}$.\nFor comparison, the value from the first data point is $r = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{4}\\ln(8.6087) \\approx \\frac{2.1528}{4} \\approx 0.5382$ h$^{-1}$.\nThe values are highly consistent, confirming the validity of the model for this dataset. We will use the exact expression for $r$ from the first data point for subsequent calculations. The fitted parameter is $r = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)$ h$^{-1}$.\n\n### Part 3: Computing the time $t^{\\star}$ to reach $0.95\\,K$\n\nWe need to find the time $t^{\\star}$ such that $N(t^{\\star}) = 0.95K$. We use the expression for $t$ derived from the solution:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln\\left[\\frac{N(t)(K-N_0)}{N_0(K-N(t))}\\right]\n$$\nSubstitute $N(t) = N(t^{\\star}) = 0.95K$:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln\\left[\\frac{0.95K(K-N_0)}{N_0(K-0.95K)}\\right]\n$$\nSimplify the expression inside the logarithm:\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln\\left[\\frac{0.95K(K-N_0)}{N_0(0.05K)}\\right] = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln\\left[\\frac{0.95}{0.05}\\left(\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nWe know $\\frac{0.95}{0.05}=19$ and from Part 2, we calculated $\\frac{K-N_0}{N_0} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^7 - 1.0 \\times 10^5}{1.0 \\times 10^5} = 99$.\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln(19 \\times 99) = \\frac{1}{r}\\ln(1881)\n$$\nNow, substitute the exact expression for $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt^{\\star} = \\frac{\\ln(1881)}{\\frac{1}{4}\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)} = \\frac{4\\ln(1881)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right)}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$\\ln(1881) \\approx 7.539578$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{198}{23}\\right) \\approx \\ln(8.60869565) \\approx 2.152813$\n$$\nt^{\\star} \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 7.539578}{2.152813} \\approx \\frac{30.158312}{2.152813} \\approx 14.00878 \\text{ h}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt^{\\star} \\approx 14.0 \\text{ h}\n$$",
