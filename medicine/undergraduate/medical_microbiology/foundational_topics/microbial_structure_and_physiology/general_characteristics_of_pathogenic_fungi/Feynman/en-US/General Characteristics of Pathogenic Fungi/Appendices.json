The chitin mass fraction, $f$, is defined as:\n$$f = \\frac{m_{\\text{chitin}}}{M}$$\nFrom this definition, the mass of chitin in a sample can be expressed as:\n$$m_{\\text{chitin}} = f \\cdot M$$\nThe problem states that the fluorescence signal originating from the bound dye is proportional to the mass of chitin. We can denote this component of the intensity as $I_{\\text{chitin}}$. The proportionality constant is given as $k$.\n$$I_{\\text{chitin}} = k \\cdot m_{\\text{chitin}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_{\\text{chitin}}$, we get:\n$$I_{\\text{chitin}} = k \\cdot f \\cdot M$$\nThe total observed fluorescence intensity, $I$, is the sum of the signal from the chitin-bound dye and the constant optical background, $B$.\n$$I = I_{\\text{chitin}} + B$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{\\text{chitin}}$, we arrive at the general formula for the observed fluorescence intensity:\n$$I = k \\cdot f \\cdot M + B$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second task is to compute the difference in the raw measured fluorescence intensities between isolate B and isolate A, $\\Delta I = I_{B} - I_{A}$.\n\nUsing the derived expression, we can write the intensities for isolate A ($I_{A}$) and isolate B ($I_{B}$):\n$$I_{A} = k \\cdot f_{A} \\cdot M + B$$\n$$I_{B} = k \\cdot f_{B} \\cdot M + B$$\nThe difference, $\\Delta I$, is then:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{B} - I_{A} = (k \\cdot f_{B} \\cdot M + B) - (k \\cdot f_{A} \\cdot M + B)$$\nThe background term $B$ cancels out:\n$$\\Delta I = k \\cdot f_{B} \\cdot M - k \\cdot f_{A} \\cdot M$$\nFactoring out the common terms $k$ and $M$ yields the final symbolic expression for the difference in intensities:\n$$\\Delta I = k \\cdot M \\cdot (f_{B} - f_{A})$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression for the calculation.\nGiven:\n$k = 5.00 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\text{RFU/mg}$\n$M = 2.00 \\, \\text{mg}$\n$f_{A} = 0.10$\n$f_{B} = 0.20$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\\Delta I = (5.00 \\times 10^{5}) \\cdot (2.00) \\cdot (0.20 - 0.10)$$\n$$\\Delta I = (5.00 \\times 10^{5}) \\cdot (2.00) \\cdot (0.10)$$\n$$\\Delta I = (10.0 \\times 10^{5}) \\cdot (0.10)$$\n$$\\Delta I = 1.00 \\times 10^{6} \\cdot 0.10$$\n$$\\Delta I = 1.00 \\times 10^{5}$$\nThe result is $100,000$ RFU.

Amphotericin B is a polyene macrolide antifungal agent that binds to membrane sterols and can form transmembrane pores when sufficient binding sites are occupied. Consider a simplified, scientifically realistic model in which amphotericin B binds reversibly and independently to identical sterol binding sites with one-to-one stoichiometry, and assume that pore formation likelihood increases monotonically with the fractional occupancy of sterol binding sites.\n\nBegin from the law of mass action for a reversible binding reaction $L + S \\rightleftharpoons LS$ and the definition of the dissociation constant ($K_d$) for this interaction.
