It is a standard, didactic problem in quantitative microbiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Generation Time $g$**\n\nThe exponential growth of the bacterial population is described by the equation:\n$$\nN(t) = N_{0}\\exp(\\mu t)\n$$\nwhere $N(t)$ is the population size at time $t$, $N_{0}$ is the initial population size at $t=0$, and $\\mu$ is the specific growth rate.\n\nThe generation time, $g$, is defined as the time it takes for the population to double. Therefore, at time $t=g$, the population size is $N(g) = 2N_{0}$. We substitute this condition into the growth equation:\n$$\n2N_{0} = N_{0}\\exp(\\mu g)\n$$\nSince $N_{0}$ must be positive for a population to exist, we can divide both sides by $N_{0}$:\n$$\n2 = \\exp(\\mu g)\n$$\nTo solve for $g$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\ln(\\exp(\\mu g))\n$$\nUsing the property that $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = \\mu g\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $g$ to find its expression in terms of $\\mu$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Effective Generation Time $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$**\n\nIn the presence of the aminoglycoside, the dynamics of the viable cell population, $N_{v}(t)$, are governed by the linear birth-death equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{v}}{dt} = (\\mu - k_{d})N_{v}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can define an effective specific growth rate, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mu - k_{d}$. The equation then becomes formally identical to the one in Part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{v}}{dt} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}N_{v}\n$$\nThe solution to this differential equation is:\n$$\nN_{v}(t) = N_{v}(0)\\exp(\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} t) = N_{v}(0)\\exp((\\mu - k_{d})t)\n$$\nwhere $N_{v}(0)$ is the initial number of viable cells.\n\nThe effective generation time, $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the time required for the viable cell population to double. At $t = g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, we have $N_{v}(g_{\\mathrm{eff}}) = 2N_{v}(0)$. Substituting this into the solution:\n$$\n2N_{v}(0) = N_{v}(0)\\exp((\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}})\n$$\nDividing by $N_{v}(0)$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n2 = \\exp((\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}})\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln(2) = (\\mu - k_{d})g_{\\mathrm{eff}}\n$$\nSolving for $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ yields the analytic expression:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu - k_{d}}\n$$\nFor the viable cell population to double, its size must increase over time. This requires the effective growth rate to be positive. Therefore, the condition under which doubling is possible is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} > 0 \\implies \\mu - k_{d} > 0 \\implies \\mu > k_{d}\n$$\nIf $\\mu \\le k_{d}$, the viable population will either remain constant or decline, and no doubling will occur. A positive, finite generation time $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is only defined if the birth rate exceeds the death rate.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in minutes**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Specific growth rate: $\\mu = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Per-capita death rate: $k_{d} = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we check the condition for doubling: $\\mu > k_{d}$. Here, $0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} > 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, so the condition is satisfied and the viable population will grow.\n\nNext, we calculate the effective growth rate, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mu - k_{d} = 0.95\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} - 0.45\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we use the expression for $g_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ derived in Part 2:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.50}\\,\\mathrm{h} = 1.386294\\,\\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in minutes. We convert hours to minutes by multiplying by $60$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} (\\text{in minutes}) = 1.386294\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times 60\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\approx 83.17764\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 83.18\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$",

It provides two independent pieces of information about the final state of the culture: the final optical density ($\\mathrm{OD}_{600,f}$) and the initial conditions ($X_0$, $S_0$) along with the yield coefficient ($Y_{X/S}$). The final OD measurement allows for a direct calculation of the final biomass concentration, $X_f$. The definition of the yield coefficient provides a mass balance relationship connecting the change in biomass to the change in substrate. This relationship can then be used to calculate the final substrate concentration, $S_f$, once $X_f$ is known. The problem is not contradictory or overconstrained, as it provides exactly enough information to determine the two requested unknowns, $X_f$ and $S_f$. The statement that \"growth ceases\" signifies the end of the experimental run at which point the final measurements were taken, not necessarily that the substrate concentration is zero.

The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data and parameters provided, and represents a realistic, formalizable challenge in biostatistical analysis. Therefore, a complete solution is warranted.\n\nThe solution is designed to precisely follow the algorithm described in the problem statement. The core of the solution is a function, `analyze_growth_curve`, that implements a three-stage process for each time-series dataset: window search, window selection, and parameter estimation.\n\n**Step 1: Window Search and Validation**\n\nThe program first generates all possible contiguous time windows from the input data that have a length of at least $L_{\\min} = 5$ points. Each of these potential windows is subjected to three validation checks to determine if it qualifies as a \"candidate\" for the exponential growth phase:\n\n1.  **Monotonicity**: The Optical Density (OD) values within the window must be non-decreasing. This is checked by verifying that $\\text{OD}_{i+1} \\ge \\text{OD}_i$ for all adjacent points in the window. This constraint reflects the nature of biomass accumulation during a growth phase.\n2.  **Dynamic Range**: The ratio of the final OD to the initial OD in the window must be at least $r_{\\min} = 1.30$. This ensures the window captures a significant amount of growth, filtering out periods of near-stasis that might otherwise appear linear on a logarithmic scale. The condition is $\\frac{\\text{OD}_{\\text{end}}}{\\text{OD}_{\\text{start}}} \\ge r_{\\min}$.\n3.  **Positive Growth Rate**: The exponential growth model $\\frac{dX}{dt} = \\mu X$ implies that after a logarithmic transformation, $Y(t) = \\ln(\\text{OD}(t))$, the data should follow a linear trend $Y(t) = \\mu t + C$. A valid growth phase must have a positive specific growth rate, $\\mu > 0$. Therefore, a simple linear regression of $Y(t)$ on time $t$ is performed for the window, and the estimated slope, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, must be positive.\n\nFor each window that passes all three validation checks, a full linear regression is performed.\n\n**Step 2: Linear Regression and Window Selection**\n\nFor each valid candidate window, we perform a simple linear regression of $Y_i = \\ln(\\text{OD}_i)$ on $t_i$. The key statistical outputs are the slope ($\\hat{\\beta}_1$), intercept ($\\hat{\\beta}_0$), and the coefficient of determination ($R^2$). The $R^2$ value measures the goodness of fit of the linear model and is calculated as specified:\n$$R^2 = 1 - \\frac{\\text{SSE}}{\\text{SST}}$$\nwhere SST (Total Sum of Squares) is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2$ and SSE (Sum of Squared Errors) is $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (\\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 t_i))^2$. An $R^2$ value close to $1$ indicates that the data points fall very close to the fitted regression line, which is expected for a true exponential phase.\n\nThe best window is chosen according to the specified hierarchical rule:\n1.  First, all candidate windows are partitioned into two groups: those with $R^2 \\ge R^2_{\\min} = 0.90$ and those with $R^2 < R^2_{\\min}$. The first group is preferred. If it is non-empty, the selection proceeds from this group; otherwise, the second group is used.\n2.  From the selected group, the window with the **maximal $R^2$** is chosen.\n3.  If multiple windows are tied for the maximal $R^2$, the **longest window** (i.e., the one with the most data points) is chosen among them.\n4.  If a tie still persists, the window that appears **earliest** in the time series (i.e., has the smallest starting index) is selected.\n\nThis deterministic selection rule guarantees a unique and optimal window for any given dataset.\n\n**Step 3: Parameter Estimation and Confidence Intervals**\n\nOnce the optimal exponential window is identified, the final parameters are calculated from its regression statistics.\n\n-   **Specific Growth Rate ($\\hat{\\mu}$)**: The estimated specific growth rate, $\\hat{\\mu}$, is the slope of the linear regression, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, for the selected window. Its unit is $h^{-1}$.\n-   **Doubling Time ($\\hat{t}_d$)**: The doubling time is derived from the growth rate using the fundamental relationship $t_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}$. The estimate is thus $\\hat{t}_d = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\hat{\\mu}}$, with units of $h$.\n-   **Confidence Interval for $\\mu$**: A two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for the true growth rate $\\mu$ is constructed using standard statistical inference for a linear regression slope. The interval is given by:\n    $$\\hat{\\beta}_1 \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$$\n    where:\n    -   $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ is the estimated slope ($\\hat{\\mu}$).\n    -   $n$ is the number of data points in the selected window.\n    -   $t_{\\alpha/2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom for a confidence level of $1-\\alpha = 0.95$. This is the $(1 - \\alpha/2) = 0.975$ quantile, obtained using `scipy.stats.t.ppf`.\n    -   $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1)$ is the standard error of the slope estimate, calculated as $SE(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\sqrt{\\frac{MSE}{S_{xx}}}$, where $MSE = \\frac{SSE}{n-2}$ is the Mean Squared Error and $S_{xx} = \\sum (t_i - \\bar{t})^2$.\n-   **Confidence Interval for $t_d$**: The function $t_d(\\mu) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu}$ is monotonically decreasing for $\\mu > 0$. Therefore, the confidence interval for $t_d$ can be obtained by transforming the endpoints of the confidence interval for $\\mu$. If the CI for $\\mu$ is $[\\mu_{\\text{lower}}, \\mu_{\\text{upper}}]$, the corresponding CI for $t_d$ is $[\\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu_{\\text{upper}}}, \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu_{\\text{lower}}}]$, which becomes $[t_{d,\\text{lower}}, t_{d,\\text{upper}}]$.\n\nThe final program implements this entire logic, applying it to each test case provided and formatting the comprehensive output as a single-line string.",
