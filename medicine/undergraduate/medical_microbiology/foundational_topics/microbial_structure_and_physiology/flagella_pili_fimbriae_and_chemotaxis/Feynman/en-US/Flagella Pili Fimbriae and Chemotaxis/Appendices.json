            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding with a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System 1**: A *Neisseria* strain that normally expresses type IV pili.\n- **Mutation 1**: Deletion of the gene `pilE`, which encodes the major pilin subunit of the pilus fiber.\n- **Assay 1**: A twitching motility assay on semi-solid medium.\n- **System 2**: A uropathogenic *Escherichia coli* (UPEC) strain that normally expresses type $1$ fimbriae via the chaperone-usher pathway.\n- **Mutation 2**: Deletion of the gene `fimA`, which encodes the major fimbrial shaft subunit.\n- **Assay 2**: A static adhesion assay to human bladder epithelial cells.\n- **Constraint**: The prediction must be based only on first principles of how polymeric surface structures are assembled and how they generate function.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in established principles of medical microbiology and bacterial genetics. *Neisseria* spp. use type IV pili, with PilE as the major subunit, for twitching motility. Uropathogenic *E. coli* (UPEC) uses type $1$ fimbriae, with FimA as the major shaft subunit and FimH as the terminal adhesin, to bind to mannosylated receptors on bladder epithelial cells. The genes (`pilE`, `fimA`), structures (type IV pili, type $1$ fimbriae), assembly pathway (chaperone-usher), and functions (twitching motility, adhesion) are all described correctly. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly formulated. It asks for the phenotypic consequences of specific gene deletions that target the primary structural components of two distinct appendages. The relationship between the deleted gene and the assayed function is direct, allowing for a unique and logical solution based on first principles.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem provides all necessary information to deduce the outcome based on the specified constraints. It describes the wild-type state, the specific genetic modification, the function of the gene product, and the functional assay being performed for each mutant.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core principle to be applied is that the function of a macroscopic biological structure is contingent upon its proper assembly from its constituent molecular components. Both type IV pili and type $1$ fimbriae are polymeric fibers composed primarily of repeating subunits, known as the major pilin/fimbrial subunits.\n\n1.  **Analysis of the *Neisseria pilE* Mutant**:\n    - Type IV pili are dynamic polymers that mediate twitching motility through cycles of extension, surface attachment, and retraction.\n    - The pilus fiber is a helical polymer composed of thousands of copies of the major pilin subunit, PilE.\n    - The gene `pilE` encodes this major subunit. A deletion of `pilE` (`\\Delta pilE`) results in the inability to produce the primary building block of the pilus fiber.\n    - **First Principle Application**: Without the major subunit, the pilus fiber cannot be assembled. Minor pilins, which are present in much smaller quantities and have specialized roles (e.g., initiation, adhesion), cannot substitute for the major structural protein to form a functional fiber. The machinery for pilus retraction (e.g., the ATPase PilT) is irrelevant if there is no pilus to retract.\n    - **Conclusion**: The absence of the pilus fiber means the physical structure required for twitching motility is absent. Therefore, a `\\Delta pilE` mutant will be completely deficient in twitching motility.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the UPEC *fimA* Mutant**:\n    - Type $1$ fimbriae are surface appendages that mediate adhesion of UPEC to host cells.\n    - The structure consists of a long, rigid rod (or shaft) and a short, flexible tip fibrillum. The rod is a polymer of the major subunit, FimA. The tip contains the adhesin FimH, which binds to mannose-containing glycoproteins on host cells, such as the bladder epithelium.\n    - The gene `fimA` encodes the FimA subunit. A deletion of `fimA` (`\\Delta fimA`) results in the inability to produce the major component of the fimbrial rod.\n    - **First Principle Application**: Without the FimA subunit, the long rod structure cannot be assembled. The chaperone-usher system may assemble a minimal structure at the bacterial surface consisting of the minor subunits (FimG, FimF) and the FimH adhesin, but this structure lacks the lengthy projection provided by the FimA rod. This projection is critical for overcoming electrostatic repulsion between the bacterium and host cell and for presenting the FimH adhesin in a functionally accessible position.\n    - **Conclusion**: The absence of the fimbrial rod will severely impair or completely abolish the ability of the bacterium to adhere to bladder epithelial cells via the type $1$ fimbrial mechanism. This adhesion is specifically known as mannose-sensitive adhesion because it can be inhibited by free mannose. Therefore, a `\\Delta fimA` mutant will have its mannose-sensitive adhesion phenotype abolished.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Deleting pilE abolishes twitching motility in Neisseria; deleting fimA abolishes mannose-sensitive adhesion to bladder epithelial cells in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Correct. As derived above, deleting the gene for the major pilin subunit (`pilE`) prevents the assembly of the pilus fiber, thus abolishing the motility that depends on it.\n- UPEC prediction: Correct. As derived above, deleting the gene for the major shaft subunit (`fimA`) prevents the formation of the fimbrial rod, which is essential for presenting the FimH adhesin and mediating adhesion. This specific adhesion is mannose-sensitive.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**B. Deleting pilE retains twitching in Neisseria via compensation by minor pilins and PilT retraction; deleting fimA yields little change in bladder adhesion because P pili compensate in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Minor pilins cannot functionally replace the major subunit to form a polymer of sufficient length for twitching. The PilT retraction motor cannot function without a pilus to act upon.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. This invokes an assumption not provided in the problem statement—the presence and expression of P pili. The question requires a prediction based on the described system. Furthermore, P pili mediate a different type of adhesion (to globoside receptors), so they would not \"compensate\" for the loss of mannose-sensitive adhesion; they would constitute a different function.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**C. Deleting pilE primarily impairs chemotaxis sensing but preserves twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA increases bladder adhesion in UPEC by exposing FimH directly on the outer membrane.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. While pilus-mediated motility can be directed, the primary function of the pilus itself is motility, not sensing. The definitive phenotype of a `pilE` mutant is the loss of the pilus structure and therefore the complete loss of twitching motility. It is not preserved.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. Exposing FimH directly at the outer membrane, without the FimA shaft, would drastically *decrease* adhesion due to steric hindrance and the inability to bridge the gap to the host cell surface.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Deleting pilE reduces flagellar swimming but not twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA reduces biofilm formation but not bladder epithelial adhesion in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Pathogenic *Neisseria* species are typically non-flagellated; they do not perform flagellar swimming. Pili are distinct from flagella. The statement that twitching is *not* reduced is the exact opposite of the expected outcome.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. Initial adhesion is a prerequisite for biofilm formation on host cells. The loss of the primary adhesion mechanism (type $1$ fimbriae) would necessarily reduce or abolish both adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation. Claiming that adhesion is not reduced is fundamentally wrong.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Deleting pilE affects only DNA uptake (natural competence) but not twitching in Neisseria; deleting fimA alters lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and thereby increases adhesion in UPEC.**\n- *Neisseria* prediction: Incorrect. Type IV pili are multifunctional, mediating twitching motility, adhesion, and natural competence (DNA uptake). Deleting `pilE` ablates all these functions. The claim that twitching is not affected is false.\n- UPEC prediction: Incorrect. The `fimA` gene encodes a fimbrial protein subunit and is not involved in the biosynthesis or structure of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). There is no first-principle basis for this pleiotropic effect. The prediction of increased adhesion is also incorrect.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.",

            "introduction": "Having established the structural basis of appendages, we now turn to the physics governing their function. A bacterium swimming through a fluid experiences a world dominated by viscosity, a regime described by a low Reynolds number. This practice  challenges you to use first principles of physics to predict how a change in the fluid environment quantitatively affects a bacterium's swimming speed and the rotation of its flagellar motor.",

            "problem": "A rod-shaped bacterium swims using a single rotating helical flagellum in a Newtonian fluid at a low Reynolds number (Re). Use only the following foundational facts:\n- At low Reynolds number, hydrodynamic drag forces and torques on a rigid body are linear in the translational velocity and angular velocity, and the corresponding resistance coefficients are proportional to the dynamic viscosity $ \\eta $ for fixed geometry.\n- A freely swimming bacterium experiences zero net external force at steady state.\n- The bacterial flagellar motor produces approximately constant torque $ \\tau_{0} $ that is load-independent up to a knee angular frequency $ \\omega_{k} $.\n\nAssume the bacterium is initially swimming steadily in a fluid of viscosity $ \\eta $, with angular rotation rate $ \\omega $ and swimming speed $ v $, and that $ |\\omega| < \\omega_{k} $. The medium viscosity is then increased twofold to $ 2\\eta $, without changing the flagellar or cell geometry. The motor torque remains approximately constant because the operating angular frequency stays below the knee frequency.\n\nUsing only the principles stated, determine how the steady-state angular rotation rate and swimming speed scale with the viscosity change. Report your final result as a unitless row matrix in the order $ \\left( \\frac{\\omega_{\\text{new}}}{\\omega_{\\text{old}}}, \\frac{v_{\\text{new}}}{v_{\\text{old}}} \\right) $. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of low Reynolds number hydrodynamics, is well-posed, and uses objective, formalizable language. We can proceed with a solution based on the provided principles.\n\nLet the bacterium consist of two rigid parts: the cell body and the flagellum. Let their angular velocities in the laboratory frame be $\\Omega_{\\text{body}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$, respectively, along the axis of swimming. The quantity $\\omega$ given in the problem is the relative angular velocity between the flagellum and the body, which is the rotation rate of the motor itself: $\\omega = \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} - \\Omega_{\\text{body}}$. The bacterium as a whole translates with a steady-state speed $v$.\n\nAccording to the provided principles, the system is in mechanical equilibrium at steady state, meaning there is no net external force and no net external torque acting on the bacterium. The motor provides an internal torque $\\tau_0$ on the flagellum and, by Newton's third law, a torque $-\\tau_0$ on the cell body.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the rotational motion using a torque balance.\nFor a freely swimming bacterium, the total external torque is zero. The only external torques are the hydrodynamic drag torques on the body and the flagellum.\nLet the hydrodynamic drag torque on the body be $T_{\\text{d,body}}$ and on the flagellum be $T_{\\text{d,flag}}$. The net external torque is zero:\n$$ T_{\\text{d,body}} + T_{\\text{d,flag}} = 0 $$\nNow, consider the torque balance on each component individually.\nFor the cell body, the sum of the torque from the motor and the hydrodynamic drag torque is zero:\n$$ -\\tau_0 + T_{\\text{d,body}} = 0 \\implies T_{\\text{d,body}} = \\tau_0 $$\nFor the flagellum, the sum of the motor torque and the hydrodynamic drag torque is zero:\n$$ \\tau_0 + T_{\\text{d,flag}} = 0 \\implies T_{\\text{d,flag}} = -\\tau_0 $$\nThis is consistent with the zero net external torque condition.\n\nFrom the first principle, hydrodynamic torques are linear in angular velocity:\n$T_{\\text{d,body}} = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}} \\Omega_{\\text{body}}$\n$T_{\\text{d,flag}} = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}} \\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$\nwhere $\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}$ and $\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}$ are the rotational resistance coefficients. The negative sign indicates that drag opposes rotation.\n\nSubstituting these into the balance equations:\n$\\tau_0 = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}} \\Omega_{\\text{body}} \\implies \\Omega_{\\text{body}} = -\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}}$\n$-\\tau_0 = -\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}} \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} \\implies \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}}$\n\nThe relative angular velocity $\\omega$ is then:\n$$ \\omega = \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} - \\Omega_{\\text{body}} = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}} - \\left(-\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}}\\right) = \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}} + \\frac{1}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nAccording to the problem statement, resistance coefficients are proportional to the dynamic viscosity $\\eta$. Thus, we can write $\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}} = k_{R,\\text{body}} \\eta$ and $\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}} = k_{R,\\text{flag}} \\eta$, where the $k$ factors depend only on the fixed geometry. Substituting these into the expression for $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega = \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{R,\\text{flag}} \\eta} + \\frac{1}{k_{R,\\text{body}} \\eta} \\right) = \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\eta} \\left( \\frac{1}{k_{R,\\text{flag}}} + \\frac{1}{k_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nThe motor torque $\\tau_0$ is constant, and the geometric factors $k$ are constant. Therefore, the angular rotation rate $\\omega$ is inversely proportional to the viscosity $\\eta$:\n$$ \\omega \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta} $$\nWhen the viscosity is changed from $\\eta_{\\text{old}} = \\eta$ to $\\eta_{\\text{new}} = 2\\eta$, the ratio of the new angular rate to the old one is:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega_{\\text{new}}}{\\omega_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{1/\\eta_{\\text{new}}}{1/\\eta_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{old}}}{\\eta_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\eta}{2\\eta} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nNext, let us analyze the translational motion using a force balance.\nAt steady state, the net force on the bacterium is zero. This means the total propulsive thrust force, $F_{\\text{thrust}}$, must be equal and opposite to the total hydrodynamic drag force, $F_{\\text{drag}}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} + F_{\\text{drag}} = 0 $$\nThe total drag force on the bacterium moving at speed $v$ is $F_{\\text{drag}} = -\\gamma_T v$, where $\\gamma_T$ is the total translational resistance coefficient. We have $\\gamma_T = k_T \\eta$.\nThe thrust is generated by the rotation of the helical flagellum and the counter-rotation of the body. At low Reynolds number, forces and torques are linearly related to velocities. This means the thrust force is a linear combination of the angular velocities:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = c_{\\text{flag}} \\Omega_{\\text{flag}} + c_{\\text{body}} \\Omega_{\\text{body}} $$\nThe coefficients $c_{\\text{flag}}$ and $c_{\\text{body}}$ are coupling coefficients that relate angular velocity to translational force. As part of the generalized resistance matrix describing the hydrodynamics, these coefficients are also proportional to viscosity $\\eta$. So, $c_{\\text{flag}} = j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta$ and $c_{\\text{body}} = j_{\\text{body}} \\eta$, where $j$ factors depend on geometry.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Omega_{\\text{flag}}$ and $\\Omega_{\\text{body}}$:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = (j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{flag}}} \\right) + (j_{\\text{body}} \\eta) \\left( -\\frac{\\tau_0}{\\gamma_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nSubstitute $\\gamma_R = k_R \\eta$:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = (j_{\\text{flag}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{k_{R,\\text{flag}} \\eta} \\right) - (j_{\\text{body}} \\eta) \\left( \\frac{\\tau_0}{k_{R,\\text{body}} \\eta} \\right) $$\nThe viscosity $\\eta$ cancels out in the expression for thrust:\n$$ F_{\\text{thrust}} = \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{j_{\\text{flag}}}{k_{R,\\text{flag}}} - \\frac{j_{\\text{body}}}{k_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) $$\nSince $\\tau_0$ and all $j$ and $k$ factors are constant, the thrust force $F_{\\text{thrust}}$ is constant and independent of viscosity.\n\nThe force balance is $F_{\\text{thrust}} + F_{\\text{drag}} = 0$, so $F_{\\text{thrust}} = -F_{\\text{drag}} = \\gamma_T v$.\n$$ \\tau_0 \\left( \\frac{j_{\\text{flag}}}{k_{R,\\text{flag}}} - \\frac{j_{\\text{body}}}{k_{R,\\text{body}}} \\right) = (k_T \\eta) v $$\nThe left side is constant. Let's call it $C$. Then $C = k_T \\eta v$.\nSolving for the swimming speed $v$:\n$$ v = \\frac{C}{k_T \\eta} $$\nThis shows that the swimming speed $v$ is inversely proportional to the viscosity $\\eta$:\n$$ v \\propto \\frac{1}{\\eta} $$\nWhen the viscosity changes from $\\eta_{\\text{old}} = \\eta$ to $\\eta_{\\text{new}} = 2\\eta$, the ratio of the new swimming speed to the old one is:\n$$ \\frac{v_{\\text{new}}}{v_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{1/\\eta_{\\text{new}}}{1/\\eta_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{old}}}{\\eta_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{\\eta}{2\\eta} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nBoth the angular rotation rate and the swimming speed are reduced by a factor of $2$.

For notational convenience, let $A_p = [{\\mathrm{A\\text{-}P}}]$, $Y_p = [{\\mathrm{Y\\text{-}P}}]$, $A = [{\\mathrm{A}}]$, and $Y = [{\\mathrm{Y}}]$.\n\nThe system is described by the following reactions:\n$1.$ Autophosphorylation of CheA: $A \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{ap}}} A_p$\n$2.$ Autodephosphorylation of CheA-P: $A_p \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{Adep}}} A$\n$3.$ Phosphotransfer from CheA-P to CheY: $A_p + Y \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{AY}}} A + Y_p$\n$4.$ Spontaneous dephosphorylation of CheY-P: $Y_p \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{dp}}} Y$\n$5.$ CheZ-mediated dephosphorylation of CheY-P: $Y_p \\xrightarrow{k_{\\mathrm{Z}}Z_T} Y$\n\nBased on mass-action kinetics, we can write the ordinary differential equations for the concentrations of the phosphorylated species $A_p$ and $Y_p$:\n$$\n\\frac{d A_p}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A - k_{\\mathrm{Adep}} A_p - k_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p Y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d Y_p}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p Y - k_{\\mathrm{dp}} Y_p - k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T Y_p = k_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p Y - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\n\nThe total concentrations of CheA and CheY are conserved:\n$$\nA_T = A + A_p \\implies A = A_T - A_p\n$$\n$$\nY_T = Y + Y_p \\implies Y = Y_T - Y_p\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{d A_p}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{d Y_p}{dt} = 0$.\nThe steady-state equations are:\n$$\n(1) \\quad 0 = k_{\\mathrm{ap}}(A_T - A_p) - k_{\\mathrm{Adep}} A_p - k_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p (Y_T - Y_p)\n$$\n$$\n(2) \\quad 0 = k_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p (Y_T - Y_p) - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\n\nFrom equation $(2)$, we can express the term for phosphotransfer in terms of $Y_p$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{AY}} A_p (Y_T - Y_p) = (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\nThis relation signifies that at steady state, the rate of formation of $Y_p$ equals its rate of removal.\n\nWe can substitute this expression into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n0 = k_{\\mathrm{ap}}(A_T - A_p) - k_{\\mathrm{Adep}} A_p - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $A_p$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T - (k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}}) A_p = (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\n$$\n(k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}}) A_p = k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\n$$\n(3) \\quad A_p = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p}{k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}}}\n$$\nNow, we can also rearrange the phosphotransfer balance from equation $(2)$ to express $A_p$ in terms of $Y_p$:\n$$\n(4) \\quad A_p = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p}{k_{\\mathrm{AY}}(Y_T - Y_p)}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $A_p$ from $(3)$ and $(4)$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p}{k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}}} = \\frac{(k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p}{k_{\\mathrm{AY}}(Y_T - Y_p)}\n$$\nThis is an equation solely for the unknown $Y_p$. To solve it, we cross-multiply:\n$$\n\\left( k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p \\right) k_{\\mathrm{AY}}(Y_T - Y_p) = \\left( k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}} \\right) (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) Y_p\n$$\nExpanding the left side:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_T - k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_p - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_T Y_p + (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_p^2\n$$\nLet's group the terms to form a standard quadratic equation $a Y_p^2 + b Y_p + c = 0$.\nThe $Y_p^2$ term coefficient is:\n$a = (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) k_{\\mathrm{AY}}$\n\nThe $Y_p$ term coefficient is:\n$b = -k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T k_{\\mathrm{AY}} - (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_T - (k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}})(k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T)$\n$b = - \\left[ k_{\\mathrm{AY}} (k_{\\mathrm{ap}}A_T + (k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T)Y_T) + (k_{\\mathrm{ap}} + k_{\\mathrm{Adep}})(k_{\\mathrm{dp}} + k_{\\mathrm{Z}} Z_T) \\right]$\n\nThe constant term is:\n$c = k_{\\mathrm{ap}} A_T k_{\\mathrm{AY}} Y_T$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided.
