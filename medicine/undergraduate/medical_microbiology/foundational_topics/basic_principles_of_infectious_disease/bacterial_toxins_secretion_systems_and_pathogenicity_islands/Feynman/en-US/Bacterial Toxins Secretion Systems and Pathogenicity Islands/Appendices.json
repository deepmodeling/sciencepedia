            "problem": "An enteric bacterial pathogen carries a pathogenicity island that encodes a Type III Secretion System (T3SS) and multiple cytotoxins. In a well-mixed, constant environment with ongoing exposure to integrative genetic elements, assume that the island undergoes site-specific excision from the chromosome and reintegration into the chromosome as independent, memoryless events. Specifically, excision occurs with a constant per-cell rate $k_{ex}$ and integration occurs with a constant per-cell rate $k_{in}$, both having units of $\\mathrm{time}^{-1}$.

Horizontal gene transfer, including the gain and loss of pathogenicity islands via mechanisms like phage-mediated transduction or excision/integration of mobile genetic elements, is a fundamental process in bacterial evolution and pathogenesis. Modeling this process using first-order kinetics is a standard and valid approach in mathematical biology, representing the macroscopic behavior of a large population undergoing stochastic, independent events at the single-cell level. The concepts of T3SS, cytotoxins, and PAIs are central to medical microbiology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It defines two mutually exclusive states (island-present and island-absent), provides constant rates for the transitions between them, and asks for the governing differential equation and its steady-state solution. This structure guarantees that a unique and stable steady-state solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by defining the system. The total population is divided into two mutually exclusive subpopulations: cells that possess the pathogenicity island, with a fraction $P(t)$, and cells that lack it. By the principle of conservation, the fraction of cells lacking the island is $1 - P(t)$. The rate of change of the fraction of island-positive cells, $\\frac{dP}{dt}$, is determined by the balance between the rate at which cells acquire the island (inflow) and the rate at which they lose it (outflow).\n\n**1. Derivation of the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nThe model is based on first-order transitions between two states: island-absent and island-present.\n$$ \\text{island-absent} \\xrightarrow{k_{in}} \\text{island-present} $$\n$$ \\text{island-present} \\xrightarrow{k_{ex}} \\text{island-absent} $$\n\nThe inflow term corresponds to the conversion of island-absent cells to island-present cells. The rate of this process is the product of the per-cell integration rate constant, $k_{in}$, and the fraction of cells available to undergo integration, which is the island-absent fraction, $1 - P(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Inflow Rate} = k_{in} (1 - P(t)) $$\n\nThe outflow term corresponds to the conversion of island-present cells to island-absent cells. The rate of this process is the product of the per-cell excision rate constant, $k_{ex}$, and the fraction of cells that currently possess the island, $P(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Outflow Rate} = k_{ex} P(t) $$\n\nThe net rate of change of $P(t)$ is the difference between the inflow and outflow rates:\n$$ \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = (\\text{Inflow Rate}) - (\\text{Outflow Rate}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the inflow and outflow terms yields the governing ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_{in} (1 - P(t)) - k_{ex} P(t) $$\n\n**2. Solution for the Steady-State Fraction ($P^{\\ast}$)**\n\nThe steady state is the condition where the system reaches equilibrium, and the net rate of change is zero. At this point, the fraction $P(t)$ becomes constant. We denote this steady-state fraction as $P^{\\ast}$. Mathematically, this condition is expressed as $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$.\n\nSetting the ODE to zero, we replace $P(t)$ with $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ 0 = k_{in} (1 - P^{\\ast}) - k_{ex} P^{\\ast} $$\nThis equation signifies that at steady state, the rate of island acquisition equals the rate of island loss. We now solve for $P^{\\ast}$ algebraically.\n$$ k_{in} (1 - P^{\\ast}) = k_{ex} P^{\\ast} $$\n$$ k_{in} - k_{in} P^{\\ast} = k_{ex} P^{\\ast} $$\n$$ k_{in} = k_{in} P^{\\ast} + k_{ex} P^{\\ast} $$\nFactoring out $P^{\\ast}$ from the right-hand side:\n$$ k_{in} = (k_{in} + k_{ex}) P^{\\ast} $$\nIsolating $P^{\\ast}$ gives the expression for the steady-state fraction:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_{in} + k_{ex}} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation of $P^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe are given the numerical values for the rate constants:\n$$ k_{in} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{ex} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3} + 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction, as expected. To simplify the calculation, we express both terms with the same power of ten.\n$$ k_{in} = 15 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\n$$ k_{ex} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nNow, substitute these into the equation for $P^{\\ast}$:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = \\frac{15 \\times 10^{-4}}{15 \\times 10^{-4} + 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{15 \\times 10^{-4}}{(15 + 2.5) \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{15}{17.5} $$\nTo evaluate the fraction:\n$$ P^{\\ast} = \\frac{15}{17.5} = \\frac{30}{35} = \\frac{6}{7} $$\nConverting this exact fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$ P^{\\ast} \\approx 0.857142857... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $5$, $7$, and $1$. The fifth significant figure is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$ P^{\\ast} \\approx 0.8571 $$",
