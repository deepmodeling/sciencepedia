            "problem": "A human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecule mediates humoral immunity by binding antigens through variable domains and recruiting effector functions through constant domains. The IgG architecture consists of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Each heavy chain comprises one Variable Heavy (V_H) domain, followed by Constant Heavy domains $C_{H1}$, hinge, $C_{H2}$, and $C_{H3}$, whereas each light chain comprises one Variable Light (V_L) domain followed by one Constant Light (C_L) domain. Immunoglobulin domains are folded structures stabilized by intrachain disulfide bonds, and additional interchain disulfide bonds join heavy and light chains and the two heavy chains. A disulfide bond is formed by the oxidation of two cysteine residues, so each disulfide bond consumes exactly two cysteines.\n\nConsider a human IgG subclass $1$ (IgG1) in which the two polypeptides are presented as amino acid sequence segments (for schematic mapping only) with the following plausible segment lengths: for each heavy chain, $V_{H}$ is $110$ residues, $C_{H1}$ is $110$ residues, hinge is $15$ residues, $C_{H2}$ is $110$ residues, and $C_{H3}$ is $110$ residues; for each light chain, $V_{L}$ is $110$ residues and $C_{L}$ is $110$ residues. Map these segments to the structural features $V_{H}$, $V_{L}$, $C_{H1}$–$C_{H3}$, $C_{L}$, and hinge. Then, using canonical and well-tested immunoglobulin facts as the fundamental base:\n- Each immunoglobulin domain (variable or constant) contains exactly one intrachain disulfide bond.\n- Each light chain is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by one interchain disulfide bond between regions adjacent to $C_{H1}$ and $C_{L}$.\n- Human IgG1 contains $2$ inter-heavy disulfide bonds within the hinge region joining the two heavy chains.\n\nCompute the total number of cysteine residues required across all four chains to satisfy all intrachain and interchain disulfide bonds of the intact IgG1 molecule. Express your answer as an exact integer; no rounding is necessary. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Molecule**: Human Immunoglobulin G, subclass $1$ (IgG1).\n- **Structure**: Two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains.\n- **Heavy Chain Components**: One Variable Heavy ($V_H$) domain, one Constant Heavy domain $1$ ($C_{H1}$), a hinge region, one Constant Heavy domain $2$ ($C_{H2}$), and one Constant Heavy domain $3$ ($C_{H3}$).\n- **Light Chain Components**: One Variable Light ($V_L$) domain and one Constant Light ($C_L$) domain.\n- **Disulfide Bond Chemistry**: $1$ disulfide bond is formed from $2$ cysteine residues.\n- **Segment Lengths**: The problem provides segment lengths for heavy chain components ($V_{H}$: $110$, $C_{H1}$: $110$, hinge: $15$, $C_{H2}$: $110$, $C_{H3}$: $110$) and light chain components ($V_{L}$: $110$, $C_{L}$: $110$). This information is noted but will be assessed for relevance.\n- **Disulfide Bond Rules**:\n    1.  Each immunoglobulin domain (variable or constant) contains exactly one intrachain disulfide bond.\n    2.  Each light chain is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by one interchain disulfide bond.\n    3.  Human IgG1 contains $2$ inter-heavy disulfide bonds within the hinge region.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The description of IgG1 structure, including the types and arrangement of polypeptide chains ($2$ heavy, $2$ light), the domain organization ($V_H, V_L, C_{H1-3}, C_L$), the presence of a hinge region, and the role of disulfide bonds, is entirely consistent with established principles of immunology and protein biochemistry. The specified disulfide bond pattern for human IgG1 (one intrachain per domain, two inter-heavy chain, one heavy-light per pair) is a canonical representation found in scientific literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness and Completeness**: The problem asks for a definite quantity, the total number of cysteine residues, and provides a complete set of rules to calculate it. The relationship between disulfide bonds and cysteine residues is explicitly defined ($1$ bond = $2$ cysteines). The number of intrachain and interchain bonds is fully specified by the rules. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The segment lengths are extraneous to the calculation but do not invalidate the problem; they are plausible distractor values.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in clear, factual, and unbiased scientific language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a well-defined calculation based on canonical biological facts. A step-by-step solution can be constructed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to calculate the total number of cysteine residues in a single, intact human IgG1 molecule based on the provided structural rules.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the number of disulfide bonds and the number of cysteine residues. As stated, each disulfide bond is formed from the oxidation of two cysteine residues. Therefore, the total number of cysteine residues, $N_{\\text{cysteine}}$, is twice the total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$.\n$$N_{\\text{cysteine}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{bonds}}$$\nThe total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$, is the sum of all intrachain bonds ($N_{\\text{intrachain}}$) and all interchain bonds ($N_{\\text{interchain}}$).\n$$N_{\\text{bonds}} = N_{\\text{intrachain}} + N_{\\text{interchain}}$$\n\nWe will calculate each component separately.\n\n**1. Calculation of Intrachain Disulfide Bonds ($N_{\\text{intrachain}}$)**\nThe problem states that each immunoglobulin domain, whether variable or constant, contains exactly one intrachain disulfide bond. We must therefore count the total number of such domains in the IgG1 molecule.\n\n- An IgG1 molecule has $2$ identical heavy chains and $2$ identical light chains.\n- Each heavy chain consists of the domains $V_H$, $C_{H1}$, $C_{H2}$, and $C_{H3}$. The hinge is a flexible region and is not classified as a canonical immunoglobulin domain in this context. Thus, each heavy chain contains $4$ immunoglobulin domains.\n- Total domains in the two heavy chains = $2 \\text{ chains} \\times 4 \\text{ domains/chain} = 8 \\text{ domains}$.\n- Each light chain consists of the domains $V_L$ and $C_L$. Thus, each light chain contains $2$ immunoglobulin domains.\n- Total domains in the two light chains = $2 \\text{ chains} \\times 2 \\text{ domains/chain} = 4 \\text{ domains}$.\n\nThe total number of immunoglobulin domains in one IgG1 molecule is the sum of domains from all chains:\n$$N_{\\text{domains}} = 8 + 4 = 12 \\text{ domains}$$\nSince each domain has one intrachain disulfide bond:\n$$N_{\\text{intrachain}} = N_{\\text{domains}} = 12 \\text{ bonds}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Interchain Disulfide Bonds ($N_{\\text{interchain}}$)**\nThe problem specifies the number and location of interchain bonds. These bonds link the separate polypeptide chains together.\n\n- **Heavy-Light (H-L) Bonds**: \"Each light chain is linked to its corresponding heavy chain by one interchain disulfide bond.\" Since there are two light chains, there are $2$ such bonds in total.\n- **Heavy-Heavy (H-H) Bonds**: \"Human IgG1 contains $2$ inter-heavy disulfide bonds within the hinge region.\"\n\nThe total number of interchain disulfide bonds is the sum of these two types:\n$$N_{\\text{interchain}} = 2 \\text{ (H-L bonds)} + 2 \\text{ (H-H bonds)} = 4 \\text{ bonds}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Total Cysteines**\nNow we can find the total number of disulfide bonds, $N_{\\text{bonds}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{bonds}} = N_{\\text{intrachain}} + N_{\\text{interchain}} = 12 + 4 = 16 \\text{ bonds}$$\nFinally, we calculate the total number of cysteine residues, $N_{\\text{cysteine}}$, required to form these $16$ bonds:\n$$N_{\\text{cysteine}} = 2 \\times N_{\\text{bonds}} = 2 \\times 16 = 32$$\n\nThe amino acid sequence lengths provided for each domain and the hinge region are consistent with typical values but are not required for the calculation, which depends only on the count of domains and the specified number of interchain bonds. The total number of cysteine residues is $32$.",

            "introduction": "An antibody's structure is not arbitrary; it is precisely tailored to its dual roles of antigen recognition and immune system activation. This problem presents a hypothetical scenario—a mutation that prevents the two heavy chains of an IgG molecule from linking together—to explore the direct consequences of structural integrity on function . By reasoning through the effects of this change, you will learn to distinguish between antigen affinity and avidity and appreciate why the complete, Y-shaped structure is essential for most antibody effector functions.",

            "problem": "A recombinant human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody is engineered such that a conserved inter-chain cysteine in the heavy chain hinge region is replaced by serine. The hinge normally contains cysteine residues that form inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds, stabilizing the heterotetrameric structure $H_2L_2$. The antibody is expressed in a B cell line and secreted under physiological oxidizing conditions of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Use the following fundamental bases to reason your prediction: protein chemistry of cysteine thiol oxidation to disulfide bonds, immunoglobulin architecture with antigen-binding sites in the variable domains of the Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) and effector functions mediated by the Fragment crystallizable (Fc) (constant region of the heavy chains), and the distinction between antigen-binding affinity versus avidity. Based on these principles, select the best description of the resulting structural configuration and its functional consequences for antigen binding and Fc-mediated effector functions, including Complement component 1q (C1q) binding in the classical pathway, Fc receptor interactions for opsonization, and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n\nA. The antibody assembles as an intact $H_2L_2$ tetramer via noncovalent interactions alone; antigen-binding affinity and Fc-mediated effector functions remain normal because disulfide bonds are not required for stability or function.\n\nB. The antibody is secreted predominantly as Heavy-Light (HL) “half-antibody” monomers lacking covalent heavy–heavy linkage; Fab-mediated antigen affinity per site is preserved, but avidity and antigen cross-linking decrease due to reduced valency from $2$ to $1$; Fc-mediated effector functions (C1q binding, Fc receptor engagement for opsonization, and ADCC) are markedly impaired or lost because the Fc requires the paired CH$2$/CH$3$ domains from two heavy chains.\n\nC. The mutation increases hinge flexibility, improving antigen-binding affinity by better paratope–epitope fit and enhancing Fc receptor binding due to greater exposure of CH$2$ domains.\n\nD. The antibody fails to bind antigen because the antigen-binding site is located within the Fc; however, cell-mediated immunity by T cells compensates, restoring overall protective function.\n\nE. The mutation triggers class switching to Immunoglobulin M (IgM), yielding a pentameric assembly that fully restores disulfide bonding and augments complement activation via increased C1q engagement.",
            "solution": "Begin from protein chemistry and immunoglobulin architecture. Cysteine residues in proteins possess thiol groups that, in an oxidizing environment, form disulfide bonds through oxidation of two cysteine thiols to a covalent linkage. In antibodies, conserved cysteines in the hinge region of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) link the two heavy chains. The canonical secreted IgG structure is $H_2L_2$: two heavy chains and two light chains. The stability and geometry of this heterotetramer rely on both noncovalent interactions and covalent disulfide bonds. Replacing a cysteine with serine removes the thiol, preventing disulfide bond formation at that position.\n\nAntigen binding is mediated by the variable domains (VH and VL) of the Fragment antigen-binding (Fab) arms; the Fc (Fragment crystallizable) region comprises the constant domains of the heavy chains (CH$2$ and CH$3$ for IgG). Antigen-binding affinity is the strength of binding between one paratope and one epitope; avidity reflects the combined strength from multiple binding sites. IgG normally has valency $2$. Fc-mediated effector functions require proper Fc structural integrity: Complement component 1q (C1q) binds clustered Fc regions to initiate the classical pathway, and Fc gamma receptors on effector cells bind the CH$2$/CH$3$ interface to mediate opsonization and Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC).\n\nWith the hinge cysteine removed, heavy–heavy covalent linkage is disrupted. Noncovalent interactions between heavy chains can exist but are typically insufficient to reliably maintain an intact $H_2L_2$ in secretion and circulation. A common outcome is secretion of “half-antibodies” comprising one heavy chain paired with one light chain (HL), lacking the paired heavy chain necessary to form the dimeric Fc. Each HL half retains one Fab arm, so the intrinsic antigen-binding affinity per Fab is preserved. However, valency drops from $2$ to $1$, diminishing avidity and antigen cross-linking. Moreover, the Fc region requires two heavy chains; a monomeric HL lacks the juxtaposed CH$2$/CH$3$ domains needed for C1q binding and Fc receptor engagement, severely impairing complement activation, opsonization, and ADCC. These changes reduce humoral effector mechanisms, whereas cell-mediated immunity (e.g., T cell responses) is not directly enhanced or restored by this antibody alteration.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Claims that noncovalent interactions alone are sufficient to maintain an intact $H_2L_2$ with normal function. This ignores the essential role of hinge disulfide bonds for heavy–heavy stabilization and correct Fc geometry. Empirically, elimination of hinge cysteines leads to instability and half-antibody formation. Antigen affinity per Fab may be normal, but Fc functions are not preserved. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. States secretion as HL half-antibodies lacking heavy–heavy disulfide linkage, with preserved Fab affinity per site, reduced avidity due to valency dropping from $2$ to $1$, and loss of Fc-mediated functions (C1q binding, Fc receptor engagement, ADCC) because a functional Fc requires two heavy chains. This aligns with protein chemistry and immunoglobulin architecture. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. Suggests increased hinge flexibility improves antigen affinity and enhances Fc receptor binding by exposing CH$2$ domains. While hinge flexibility can modulate geometry, removing a cysteine prevents disulfide formation and destabilizes heavy–heavy linkage rather than enhancing Fc function. Affinity is primarily determined by variable domain complementarity, not hinge flexibility alone, and Fc engagement requires intact dimeric CH$2$/CH$3$—compromised here. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Asserts antigen-binding sites are in the Fc and that T cells compensate. Antigen-binding sites are in the Fab variable regions, not the Fc. The mutation does not relocate binding. Further, antibody alterations do not automatically enhance T cell-mediated immunity. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Proposes that the mutation triggers class switching to Immunoglobulin M (IgM). Class switch recombination is a regulated genomic process controlled by activation-induced cytidine deaminase and cytokine signals, not an immediate consequence of a point mutation in the IgG heavy chain protein sequence. Therefore, spontaneous switching to IgM with restored complement activation is unsupported. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is B.",

From first principles of humoral immunity, Class-Switch Recombination (CSR) in B cells requires CD40L on $T_H$ cells engaging Cluster of Differentiation 40 (CD40) on B cells, and Germinal Center (GC) formation in secondary lymphoid organs depends on this interaction. In the absence of CD40L, CSR fails, GCs do not form, and long-lived class-switched plasma cells are not generated.

This yields:\n$$\nk_i C_{i,ss} = \\frac{P_i}{V} \\implies C_{i,ss} = \\frac{P_i}{V k_i}\n$$\nwhere $C_{i,ss}$ is the steady-state concentration. The problem provides the relationship between the rate constant $k_i$ and the half-life $t_{1/2,i}$:\n$$\nk_i = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,i}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $C_{i,ss}$ gives:\n$$\nC_{i,ss} = \\frac{P_i}{V} \\frac{t_{1/2,i}}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the steady-state concentration of IgM to IgG in the CD40L-deficient state, denoted by the superscript 'defect'.\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}}}{C_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}}} = \\frac{\\frac{P_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}}}{V} \\frac{t_{1/2,M}}{\\ln(2)}}{\\frac{P_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}}}{V} \\frac{t_{1/2,G}}{\\ln(2)}}\n$$\nThe constants $V$ and $\\ln(2)$ cancel, simplifying the ratio to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}} \\cdot t_{1/2,M}}{P_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}} \\cdot t_{1/2,G}}\n$$\nThe next step is to determine the production rates $P_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}}$ and $P_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}}$.\n\n**Production of IgG in the CD40L-deficient state ($P_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}}$):**\nIn a healthy individual, IgG production has two sources: T-dependent CSR and T-independent production. In CD40L deficiency, the T-dependent CSR pathway fails. The problem states that the TI contributions are unchanged. Therefore, the only source of IgG production is the residual TI pathway.\n$$\nP_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = r_{G,\\mathrm{TI}} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\nUsing the given value $r_{G,\\mathrm{TI}} = 0.02$, we have:\n$$\nP_{G}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = 0.02\\, P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\n\n**Production of IgM in the CD40L-deficient state ($P_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}}$):**\nIn the deficient state, the total IgM production is the sum of three components:\n$1$. The baseline TI IgM production, which is unchanged: $P_{\\mathrm{TI},M} = 0.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$2$. The fraction of the T-dependent response that would have been IgM even in a healthy individual (the unswitched plasmablasts): $(1-s)P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n$3$. The fraction of the T-dependent response that fails to undergo CSR and defaults to IgM production: $s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nThe problem states that \"all CSR that would have occurred from the $s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}$ pool fails... and these... contribute as IgM-secreting plasmablasts instead\". This means the entire antigen-driven T-dependent response, which has a total rate of $(1-s)P_{\\mathrm{total}} + s\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}} = P_{\\mathrm{total}}$, now secretes only IgM.\n\nThus, the total IgM production rate in the deficient state is the sum of the T-dependent component (which is now all IgM) and the baseline TI component:\n$$\nP_{M}^{\\mathrm{defect}} = P_{\\mathrm{total}} + P_{\\mathrm{TI},M} = P_{\\mathrm{total}} + 0.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}} = 1.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio $R$:**\nNow we substitute the expressions for the production rates and the given half-lives into the ratio formula:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(1.10\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}) \\cdot t_{1/2,M}}{(0.02\\,P_{\\mathrm{total}}) \\cdot t_{1/2,G}}\n$$\nThe $P_{\\mathrm{total}}$ terms cancel, as expected.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.10 \\cdot t_{1/2,M}}{0.02 \\cdot t_{1/2,G}}\n$$\nWe are given $t_{1/2,M} = 5$ days and $t_{1/2,G} = 21$ days.\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.10 \\times 5}{0.02 \\times 21} = \\frac{5.5}{0.42}\n$$\nTo express this as an exact fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{5.5 \\times 100}{0.42 \\times 100} = \\frac{550}{42}\n$$\nFinally, we simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{550 \\div 2}{42 \\div 2} = \\frac{275}{21}\n$$\nThe number $21$ has prime factors $3$ and $7$. The sum of the digits of $275$ is $2+7+5 = 14$, which is not divisible by $3$. Also, $275 = 7 \\times 39 + 2$, so it is not divisible by $7$. Therefore, the fraction is in its simplest form.",
