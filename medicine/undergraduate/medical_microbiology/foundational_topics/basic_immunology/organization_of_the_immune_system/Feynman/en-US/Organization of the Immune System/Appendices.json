            "problem": "A cohort of thymocytes developing in the thymus undergoes sequential selection steps that organize the T cell repertoire: first, positive selection that ensures T cell receptor recognition of self-major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and second, negative selection that removes thymocytes bearing T cell receptors (TCRs) with high affinity for self-peptide. Consider an idealized, well-mixed thymocyte population in which each cell experiences these two steps in order, with the following empirically observed failure rates: $80\\%$ fail positive selection, and among those that pass positive selection, $10\\%$ fail negative selection. Assume that all thymocytes are subject to the same selection regime, selection is applied sequentially with no additional steps, and thymocytes that pass both steps exit as mature T cells.\n\nUsing the foundational definition of conditional probability and the interpretation of sequential selection as successive filters on the population, compute the surviving fraction of the initial thymocyte population that exits the thymus as mature T cells.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A cohort of thymocytes undergoes sequential selection: first positive selection, then negative selection.\n- The failure rate for positive selection is $80\\%$.\n- The failure rate for negative selection, among those that pass positive selection, is $10\\%$.\n- The goal is to compute the surviving fraction of the initial thymocyte population.\n- The answer should be expressed as a simplified fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in fundamental immunology. Positive and negative selection are the core, established mechanisms for T cell repertoire development in the thymus. The stated sequence (positive then negative) and the high attrition rate, particularly at the positive selection stage, are consistent with biological reality. The problem is a valid, albeit simplified, model of a real biological process.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate a unique, meaningful answer. The rates are clearly defined, and the sequence of events is specified.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, using standard biological terminology. It is free of ambiguity and subjective claims.\n4.  **Complete and Consistent**: The problem is self-contained. The provided failure rates are sufficient for the calculation, and there are no contradictory statements.\n5.  **Feasible and Realistic**: The numerical values are plausible for a simplified biological model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be furnished.\n\n### Solution\nLet $S_0$ represent the initial population of thymocytes entering the selection process. The selection process consists of two sequential steps, which can be modeled as successive filters acting on the population. We are asked to find the fraction of the initial population that successfully passes both filters.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a randomly chosen thymocyte passes positive selection.\nLet $B$ be the event that a randomly chosen thymocyte passes negative selection.\n\nWe are looking for the probability that a thymocyte passes both positive and negative selection, which is $P(A \\cap B)$.\n\nThe problem states that the failure rate for positive selection is $80\\%$. This is the probability of *not* passing positive selection.\n$$P(\\neg A) = 80\\% = 0.8$$\nThe probability of passing positive selection is therefore the complement:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(\\neg A) = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\n\nNext, we consider negative selection. The problem states that among those thymocytes that pass positive selection, $10\\%$ fail negative selection. This is a conditional probability. It is the probability of failing negative selection *given* that positive selection has been passed.\n$$P(\\neg B | A) = 10\\% = 0.1$$\nThe probability of passing negative selection, given that positive selection has been passed, is the complement of this conditional probability:\n$$P(B | A) = 1 - P(\\neg B | A) = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9$$\n\nOur goal is to find the probability of a thymocyte passing both steps, $P(A \\cap B)$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we know that:\n$$P(B | A) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(A)}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the joint probability $P(A \\cap B)$ gives the multiplication rule:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = P(B | A) \\times P(A)$$\nWe can now substitute the probabilities we have determined:\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 0.9 \\times 0.2$$\n$$P(A \\cap B) = 0.18$$\nThis probability represents the fraction of the initial thymocyte population that survives both selection steps to become mature T cells.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a simplified fraction. We convert the decimal to a fraction:\n$$0.18 = \\frac{18}{100}$$\nTo simplify this fraction, we divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$:\n$$\\frac{18 \\div 2}{100 \\div 2} = \\frac{9}{50}$$\nThus, the surviving fraction of the initial thymocyte population is $\\frac{9}{50}$.",

The parameters given, such as a high scanning rate and a very low cognate frequency, are consistent with established empirical data in immunology. The modeling of this search as a series of random, independent trials is a standard and well-accepted simplification in quantitative biology.

This scenario is precisely modeled by a binomial distribution. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of cognate encounters. Then, $X$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $p$, denoted as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\n\nThe question asks for the expected number of encounters, which is the expected value of the random variable $X$, denoted $E[X]$. For a binomial distribution, the expected value is given by the product of the number of trials and the probability of success per trial.\n$$E[X] = N \\times p$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $N$ and $p$:\n$$E[X] = (R \\times T_{res}) \\times p$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values to compute the final answer.\n$$E[X] = (24 \\times 10^{4}) \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$E[X] = 24 \\times 10^{4-6}$$\n$$E[X] = 24 \\times 10^{-2}$$\n$$E[X] = 0.24$$\n\nThe expected number of encounters with cognate dendritic cells during the residence time is $0.24$. The problem's mention of \"rare\" encounters ($p \\ll 1$) and \"random\" occurrences justifies the use of this probabilistic model and also implies that a Poisson approximation with parameter $\\lambda = Np = 0.24$ would be highly accurate. The expected value of a Poisson distribution is $\\lambda$, which yields the same result. The calculation based on the fundamental binomial model is exact and sufficient.",
