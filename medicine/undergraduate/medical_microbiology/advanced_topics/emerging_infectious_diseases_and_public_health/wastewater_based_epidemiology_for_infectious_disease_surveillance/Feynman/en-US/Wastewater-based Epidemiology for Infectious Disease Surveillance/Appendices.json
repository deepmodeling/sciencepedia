The \"observed concentration,\" $C_{\\text{obs}}$, is the apparent concentration after these losses have occurred, but without having been mathematically corrected for them.\n\nThe workflow consists of three sequential, independent steps: concentration, nucleic acid extraction, and RT-qPCR amplification. The efficiency of each step represents the fraction of the target molecules that are successfully passed on to the next stage. Since the steps are independent and sequential, the total efficiency of the entire process, $\\eta_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the individual step efficiencies.\n\nLet $\\eta_{\\text{conc}}$ be the concentration efficiency, $\\eta_{\\text{extr}}$ be the extraction efficiency, and $\\eta_{\\text{amp}}$ be the amplification efficiency.

Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression**\n\nWe fit the linear model $y = a + bx + \\varepsilon$, where $a$ is the intercept, $b$ is the slope, and $\\varepsilon$ represents the error term. The OLS estimates for $a$ and $b$ are found by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary summary statistics:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 21 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = 20.1 + 23.3 + 26.7 + 29.9 + 33.3 + 36.6 = 169.9 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = 6^2 + 5^2 + 4^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 25 + 16 + 9 + 4 + 1 = 91 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i = (6)(20.1) + (5)(23.3) + (4)(26.7) + (3)(29.9) + (2)(33.3) + (1)(36.6) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i = 120.6 + 116.5 + 106.8 + 89.7 + 66.6 + 36.6 = 536.8 $$\n\nThe sample means are:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{\\sum y_i}{n} = \\frac{169.9}{6} \\approx 28.3167 $$\n\nThe slope $b$ is calculated as:\n$$ S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = \\sum x_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum x_i)^2}{n} = 91 - \\frac{21^2}{6} = 91 - 73.5 = 17.5 $$\n$$ S_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = \\sum x_i y_i - \\frac{(\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n} = 536.8 - \\frac{(21)(169.9)}{6} = 536.8 - 594.65 = -57.85 $$\n$$ b = \\frac{S_{xy}}{S_{xx}} = \\frac{-57.85}{17.5} \\approx -3.305714 $$\n\nThe intercept $a$ is calculated as:\n$$ a = \\bar{y} - b\\bar{x} \\approx 28.3167 - (-3.305714)(3.5) \\approx 28.3167 + 11.57 = 39.8867 $$\nThe fitted regression line is $C_t \\approx 39.8867 - 3.3057 \\log_{10} N_{0}$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Relationship between Slope $b$ and Efficiency $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe threshold condition for qPCR is given by $N_{0}(1+\\epsilon)^{C_t} = T$, where $N_0$ is the initial copy number, $\\epsilon$ is the amplification efficiency, $C_t$ is the cycle threshold, and $T$ is the fluorescence threshold constant.\n\nTo derive the relationship, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(N_{0}(1+\\epsilon)^{C_t}\\right) = \\ln(T) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(uv) = \\ln(u) + \\ln(v)$:\n$$ \\ln(N_0) + \\ln\\left((1+\\epsilon)^{C_t}\\right) = \\ln(T) $$\nUsing the property $\\ln(u^k) = k\\ln(u)$:\n$$ \\ln(N_0) + C_t \\ln(1+\\epsilon) = \\ln(T) $$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $C_t$:\n$$ C_t \\ln(1+\\epsilon) = \\ln(T) - \\ln(N_0) $$\n$$ C_t = \\frac{\\ln(T)}{\\ln(1+\\epsilon)} - \\frac{\\ln(N_0)}{\\ln(1+\\epsilon)} $$\nThe regression is performed on $x = \\log_{10}(N_0)$. We use the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\ln(u) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(u)$, to express $\\ln(N_0)$ in terms of $\\log_{10}(N_0)$:\n$$ \\ln(N_0) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $C_t$:\n$$ C_t = \\frac{\\ln(T)}{\\ln(1+\\epsilon)} - \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(1+\\epsilon)} \\log_{10}(N_0) $$\nThis equation is of the linear form $y = a + bx$, where $y=C_t$ and $x=\\log_{10}(N_0)$. By comparing the coefficients, we identify the slope $b$:\n$$ b = -\\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(1+\\epsilon)} $$\nThis is the analytical relationship between the slope $b$ and the amplification efficiency $\\epsilon$.\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Construction**\n\nTo construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for $b$, we first need its standard error, $SE(b)$.\nThe sum of squared errors ($SSE$) is computed. First, we compute the sum of squares for $y$:\n$$ \\sum y_i^2 = 20.1^2 + 23.3^2 + 26.7^2 + 29.9^2 + 33.3^2 + 36.6^2 = 5002.25 $$\n$$ S_{yy} = \\sum y_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum y_i)^2}{n} = 5002.25 - \\frac{(169.9)^2}{6} = 5002.25 - 4811.00166... \\approx 191.24833 $$\nNow, the sum of squared errors:\n$$ SSE = S_{yy} - b S_{xy} = 191.24833 - (-3.305714...)(-57.85) \\approx 191.24833 - 191.23557 \\approx 0.01276 $$\nThe standard error of the regression is $s_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{SSE}{n-2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.01276}{4}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00319} \\approx 0.05648$.\nThe standard error of the slope is $SE(b) = \\frac{s_e}{\\sqrt{S_{xx}}} = \\frac{0.05648}{\\sqrt{17.5}} \\approx \\frac{0.05648}{4.1833} \\approx 0.013502$.\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for $b$ is $b \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} \\cdot SE(b)$, with $n-2=4$ degrees of freedom. The critical value is $t_{0.025, 4} = 2.776$.\nCI for $b$: $-3.3057 \\pm 2.776 \\times 0.013502 \\Rightarrow -3.3057 \\pm 0.03748 \\Rightarrow [-3.3432, -3.2682]$.\nTo transform this to a CI for $\\epsilon$, we use the derived relation $\\epsilon(b) = 10^{-1/b} - 1$. This is a monotonically increasing function for $b<0$. Applying it to the endpoints:\n$\\epsilon_{lower} = 10^{-1/(-3.3432)} - 1 \\approx 10^{0.2991} - 1 \\approx 1.9912 - 1 = 0.9912$.\n$\\epsilon_{upper} = 10^{-1/(-3.2682)} - 1 \\approx 10^{0.3060} - 1 \\approx 2.023 - 1 = 1.023$.\nThe $95\\%$ CI for $\\epsilon$ is approximately $[0.991, 1.023]$.\n\n**4. Point Estimate of Amplification Efficiency $\\epsilon$**\n\nThe final task is to report the point estimate of $\\epsilon$. We use the calculated slope $b$ and the derived relationship from Part 2.\nFrom Part 1, the point estimate for the slope is $b \\approx -3.305714$.\nUsing the relationship derived in Part 2:\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{-1/b} - 1 $$\nSubstitute the value of $b$:\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{-1/(-3.305714...)} - 1 = 10^{1/3.305714...} - 1 $$\n$$ \\epsilon = 10^{0.302507...} - 1 $$\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 2.0069076 - 1 = 1.0069076 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe number is $1.0069076...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $0$, $6$. The fifth digit is $9$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 1.007 $$\nThis is the point estimate of the amplification efficiency. A value of $\\epsilon=1$ corresponds to a perfect $100\\%$ doubling of product each cycle. The calculated value is physically plausible and indicates a highly efficient reaction.",

The total observed mass load of ammonium nitrogen over a $24$-hour period, denoted $M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, is the product of the average wastewater flow rate, $Q$, and the average concentration, $C$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q \\times C$$\nThe units must be consistent.

The problem states that the non-human contribution is a fraction $f_{\\mathrm{ind}}$ of the total observed load.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{ind}} = f_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\times M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$$\nTherefore, the observed load from human sources is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = M_{\\mathrm{obs}} - M_{\\mathrm{ind}} = M_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})$$\nThe problem also specifies that the ammonium nitrogen from human sources undergoes in-sewer biogeochemical loss, modeled by a fractional loss $L$. Let $M_{\\mathrm{human, source}}$ be the total mass of ammonium nitrogen excreted by the population at the source. The observed human load is the source load attenuated by this fractional loss.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = M_{\\mathrm{human, source}}(1 - L)$$\nThe total source human load is the product of the contributing population size, $N$, and the per-capita excretion rate, $E$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, source}} = N \\times E$$\nBy combining these equations, we can establish a relationship between the observed quantities and the population $N$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}} = (N \\times E)(1 - L)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{\\mathrm{human, obs}}$ in terms of $M_{\\mathrm{obs}}$:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{obs}}(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) = N \\times E \\times (1 - L)$$\nFinally, substituting $M_{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q C$:\n$$Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) = N E (1 - L)$$\nSolving for the population estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\\hat{N} = \\frac{Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})}{E (1 - L)}$$\nThis is the desired expression for the estimator of the contributing population.\n\nTask 2: Derive an expression for $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}]$.\nTo analyze the propagation of uncertainty, we first take the natural logarithm of the estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\\ln \\hat{N} = \\ln \\left( \\frac{Q C (1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})}{E (1 - L)} \\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expression expands to:\n$$\\ln \\hat{N} = \\ln Q + \\ln C + \\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}}) - \\ln E - \\ln(1 - L)$$\nThe problem states that all sources of uncertainty are independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln Q] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln C] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})] + \\mathrm{Var}[-\\ln E] + \\mathrm{Var}[-\\ln(1 - L)]$$\nSince $\\mathrm{Var}[-X] = (-1)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[X] = \\mathrm{Var}[X]$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln Q] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln C] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln E] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})] + \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - L)]$$\nWe now evaluate each variance term based on the given uncertainty models.\nFor a variable $X$ with a small relative standard deviation $\\sigma_{X, \\mathrm{rel}}$, the variance of its natural logarithm can be approximated as $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln X] \\approx (\\sigma_{X, \\mathrm{rel}})^2$.

Evaluating at the mean $\\mu_f$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - f_{\\mathrm{ind}})] \\approx \\left( \\frac{-1}{1 - \\mu_f} \\right)^2 \\sigma_f^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_f^2}{(1 - \\mu_f)^2}$$\nSimilarly, for the term $\\ln(1 - L)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln(1 - L)] \\approx \\left( \\frac{-1}{1 - \\mu_L} \\right)^2 \\sigma_L^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_L^2}{(1 - \\mu_L)^2}$$\nCombining all the terms, we arrive at the final expression for the variance of $\\ln \\hat{N}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] = (\\sigma_{Q, \\mathrm{rel}})^2 + (\\sigma_{C, \\mathrm{rel}})^2 + (\\ln(\\mathrm{GSD}_E))^2 + \\frac{\\sigma_f^2}{(1 - \\mu_f)^2} + \\frac{\\sigma_L^2}{(1 - \\mu_L)^2}$$\n\nTask 3 & 4: Compute the point estimate $\\hat{N}$ and the coefficient of variation (CV) of $\\hat{N}$.\nThe problem does not require the point estimate as a final answer, but it is an intermediate conceptual step. The main goal is to compute $\\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}]$ and then the CV. We use the expression derived in Task 2 and substitute the given values.\n\nGiven parameters:\n$\\sigma_{Q, \\mathrm{rel}} = 0.03$\n$\\sigma_{C, \\mathrm{rel}} = 0.05$\n$\\mathrm{GSD}_E = 1.25$\n$\\mu_f = 0.12$, $\\sigma_f = 0.04$\n$\\mu_L = 0.10$, $\\sigma_L = 0.03$\n\nNow, we compute each term in the variance expression:\n$$(\\sigma_{Q, \\mathrm{rel}})^2 = (0.03)^2 = 0.0009$$\n$$(\\sigma_{C, \\mathrm{rel}})^2 = (0.05)^2 = 0.0025$$\n$$(\\ln(\\mathrm{GSD}_E))^2 = (\\ln(1.25))^2 \\approx (0.22314355)^2 \\approx 0.04979255$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_f^2}{(1 - \\mu_f)^2} = \\frac{(0.04)^2}{(1 - 0.12)^2} = \\frac{0.0016}{(0.88)^2} = \\frac{0.0016}{0.7744} \\approx 0.00206610$$\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_L^2}{(1 - \\mu_L)^2} = \\frac{(0.03)^2}{(1 - 0.10)^2} = \\frac{0.0009}{(0.90)^2} = \\frac{0.0009}{0.81} \\approx 0.00111111$$\nSumming these values gives the total variance of $\\ln \\hat{N}$, which we denote as $\\sigma_{\\ln N}^2$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\ln N}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}[\\ln \\hat{N}] \\approx 0.0009 + 0.0025 + 0.04979255 + 0.00206610 + 0.00111111$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\ln N}^2 \\approx 0.05636976$$\nThe problem states to treat $\\hat{N}$ as approximately lognormally distributed. The coefficient of variation (CV) for a lognormal random variable $X$ with log-variance $\\sigma_{\\ln X}^2$ is given by the exact relationship:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_X = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[X]}}{\\mathbb{E}[X]} = \\sqrt{\\exp(\\sigma_{\\ln X}^2) - 1}$$\nApplying this formula to our estimator $\\hat{N}$:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\hat{N}} = \\sqrt{\\exp(\\sigma_{\\ln N}^2) - 1}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $\\sigma_{\\ln N}^2$:\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\hat{N}} = \\sqrt{\\exp(0.05636976) - 1}$$\n$$\\mathrm{CV}_{\\hat{N}} = \\sqrt{1.0579892 - 1} = \\sqrt{0.0579892} \\approx 0.2408094$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get $0.241$.",
