This exercise challenges you to think like a public health virologist, prioritizing the initial steps of a risk assessment when faced with a newly isolated filovirus .

            "problem": "A team of virologists conducting surveillance in Southeast Asia has isolated a novel virus from tissue samples of *Rousettus* fruit bats. Preliminary analysis using electron microscopy reveals a filamentous morphology characteristic of the *Filoviridae* family, which includes the Ebola and Marburg viruses. The researchers have successfully propagated the new viral isolate in a bat-derived cell line. The immediate priority is to conduct an initial risk assessment to determine the virus's zoonotic potential, defined as its capacity to be transmitted from its animal reservoir to humans and cause disease. From a scientific and public health perspective, which of the following actions represents the most critical and logical *first* step in this assessment?\n\nA. Sequence the complete viral genome and perform bioinformatic analysis to compare its glycoprotein gene with those of known human-pathogenic filoviruses.\n\nB. Immediately initiate the development of a recombinant protein subunit vaccine based on the presumed viral surface proteins.\n\nC. Conduct experimental infection studies in non-human primates, such as macaques, to characterize the disease pathology and determine the lethal dose.\n\nD. Map the geographic distribution of the infected bat population and begin public health campaigns advising local communities to avoid contact with bats.\n\nE. Attempt to infect various human cell lines (e.g., HeLa, Vero E6, Huh7) with the viral isolate in a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) facility to test for cell entry and replication.",
            "solution": "Goal: Determine the most critical and logical first step to assess zoonotic potential (ability to transmit from bats to humans and cause disease) of a newly isolated, filamentous virus consistent with Filoviridae.\n\nPrinciple for prioritization: An initial risk assessment should begin with actions that are (i) maximally informative about host range and pathogenic potential, (ii) minimally risky and ethically acceptable, (iii) rapid and feasible, and (iv) capable of guiding subsequent laboratory, animal, and public health actions. In virology, early genomic characterization provides taxonomy, phylogeny, and molecular features related to host entry and pathogenicity, informing diagnostics and biosafety levels, while avoiding immediate high-risk manipulation of live virus in complex models.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A: Sequencing the complete viral genome and bioinformatic comparison, particularly of the glycoprotein gene, directly addresses determinants of host range and entry (e.g., conserved receptor-binding motifs, cleavage sites, glycosylation patterns, mucin-like domains) and allows phylogenetic placement relative to known human-pathogenic filoviruses. This step is low-risk, rapid, and foundational; it informs whether further high-containment functional assays or animal studies are warranted and guides assay and countermeasure development. As such, it is the most logical first step.\n\n- Option B: Immediate vaccine development is premature without established human risk, antigenic characterization, or evidence of human infectivity. It is neither the most informative nor the most resource-rational first action.\n\n- Option C: Experimental infection in non-human primates is high ethical, logistical, and biosafety burden and is typically reserved for later stages after genomic and cell-based evidence suggests significant zoonotic risk.\n\n- Option D: Mapping bat distributions and public advisories can be valuable, but initiating broad campaigns before establishing the virus’s human risk and basic characterization may misallocate resources and cause unintended consequences. Such measures are better informed by initial laboratory findings.\n\n- Option E: Infection of human cell lines provides functional evidence of human cell entry and replication but requires live virus work in high containment and carries higher risk than genomic analysis. It is usually undertaken after sequencing and in silico risk indicators suggest likely human tropism.\n\nConclusion: The most critical and logical first step is comprehensive genome sequencing with bioinformatic analysis, focusing on the glycoprotein gene to assess similarity to known human-pathogenic filoviruses and infer potential for human cell entry, which then guides subsequent, higher-risk studies and public health actions.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.",

            "introduction": "The geographic range of vector-borne diseases like Dengue is expanding due to factors like climate change and globalization, often raising questions about whether local insects can act as new vectors. This problem asks you to design the core laboratory workflow to definitively prove that a mosquito species can transmit a virus, a concept known as vector competence . Mastering this experimental logic is crucial for assessing transmission risk in new areas and distinguishing simple pathogen detection from true transmission capability.",
            "id": "2063076",
            "problem": "In a temperate region previously free from Dengue outbreaks, public health officials are investigating a recent cluster of cases. The typical vectors, *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus*, are not found in the area. However, a local mosquito species, *Culex australis*, is abundant. Preliminary screening of wild-caught *Cx. australis* using Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) has detected Dengue Virus (DENV) RNA. This initial finding suggests a possible link but does not confirm that *Cx. australis* is a competent vector capable of sustaining transmission.\n\nTo definitively establish the vector competence of *Cx. australis* for DENV, a series of laboratory experiments must be performed. From the list of potential studies below, select all options that represent an essential experimental step in proving vector competence.\n\nA. Sequence the DENV genome isolated from the wild-caught mosquitoes to confirm it is identical to the strain currently circulating in the local human population.\n\nB. Establish a laboratory colony of *Cx. australis* from the local population and perform controlled oral infection studies by feeding them a blood meal containing a known titer of DENV.\n\nC. At multiple time points following an infectious blood meal, dissect mosquitoes and use RT-PCR to detect the presence of DENV RNA in isolated tissues, specifically the midgut and the head/salivary glands.\n\nD. Conduct host-preference studies in a laboratory olfactometer to determine if *Cx. australis* is more attracted to human scent than to the scent of other local vertebrates (e.g., birds, rodents).\n\nE. Perform plaque assays on homogenized whole-mosquito bodies 14 days post-infection to quantify the total number of infectious DENV particles per mosquito.\n\nF. After an appropriate extrinsic incubation period, induce mosquitoes to salivate onto a substrate and use a sensitive cell culture method, such as a plaque assay, to test the saliva for the presence of infectious DENV particles.\n\nG. Compare the 21-day survival rate of mosquitoes fed a DENV-infected blood meal to that of a control group fed a non-infected blood meal.",
            "solution": "Define vector competence for a mosquito species and a given arbovirus as the ability to (i) become infected after ingesting an infectious blood meal, (ii) support viral replication and dissemination from the midgut to secondary tissues including salivary glands, and (iii) expectorate infectious virions in saliva, enabling transmission to a vertebrate host. Let the logically necessary events be denoted as $E_{1}$ (infection after oral exposure), $E_{2}$ (dissemination to and infection of salivary glands), and $E_{3}$ (presence of infectious virions in saliva). To prove competence, one must establish that $E_{1} \\land E_{2} \\land E_{3}$ holds under controlled exposure to the virus.\n\nTo test $E_{1}$ (oral susceptibility to infection), mosquitoes must be fed a blood meal with a known DENV titer under controlled laboratory conditions to ensure exposure via the natural route. This requires a laboratory colony derived from the local population to control age, prior history, and environmental conditions and to provide reproducible oral infection. Therefore, option B is essential, because it operationalizes the controlled oral infection required to evaluate $E_{1}$.\n\nTo test $E_{2}$ (dissemination and salivary gland infection), one must determine whether virus escapes the midgut and reaches distal tissues relevant to transmission. Dissecting mosquitoes at defined intervals after the infectious blood meal and detecting DENV in the midgut and the head/salivary glands provides tissue-specific evidence for midgut infection and dissemination to salivary glands. While detection modality can vary, the essential step is tissue-resolved virological assessment that differentiates midgut-limited infection from disseminated infection. Thus, option C represents an essential step for establishing $E_{2}$.\n\nTo test $E_{3}$ (transmission potential), the definitive criterion is the presence of infectious virions in saliva after an appropriate extrinsic incubation period. Collecting saliva and assaying it on susceptible cells to demonstrate infectious DENV directly tests whether the mosquito can expectorate transmissible virus. Therefore, option F is essential, as it establishes $E_{3}$ by demonstrating infectious virus in saliva.\n\nFor completeness, the remaining options are not essential to prove vector competence. Option A (genome sequencing for strain identity) informs epidemiological linkage but does not test $E_{1}$–$E_{3}$. Option D (host preference) and option G (survival) affect vectorial capacity parameters but are orthogonal to competence; formally, competence pertains to $E_{1}$–$E_{3}$, whereas capacity incorporates biting rate and survival. Option E (whole-body infectious titer) lacks tissue resolution and cannot distinguish midgut-limited infection from salivary gland infection; without saliva testing it cannot establish $E_{3}$.\n\nBy necessity and sufficiency with respect to $E_{1}$, $E_{2}$, and $E_{3}$, the essential experimental steps are those in B, C, and F.",

            "introduction": "Pathogens are not static; they constantly evolve, often by acquiring new genes that make them more dangerous, a process known as horizontal gene transfer. This advanced challenge puts you in the role of a paleogenomicist, using data from ancient human remains to trace the deep history of a key virulence factor . You will need to synthesize multiple lines of evidence—phylogenetic trees, molecular clocks, and genomic context—to solve an evolutionary puzzle and link the emergence of a pathogen's weapon to a major turning point in human history.",

            "problem": "A research group is investigating the evolutionary origins of a re-emerging periodontal pathogen, *Porphyromonas catenulae*, using metagenomic data recovered from ancient human dental calculus. Their focus is on a key virulence factor, the collagenase-adhesin fusion protein `cafA`, which is crucial for tissue destruction in severe periodontitis. The team has generated several Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs) of *P. catenulae* from human remains of different eras and compared them with modern isolates and related bacterial species. The Neolithic agricultural revolution, which began approximately 10,000 years ago, is a critical time point for this study, as the dietary shift to high-carbohydrate foods is hypothesized to have selected for new virulence strategies in oral pathogens.\n\nThe team has compiled the following key findings:\n\n1.  **Species Phylogeny**: A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the concatenated sequences of 50 conserved, single-copy core proteins. This \"species tree\" shows that all ancient and modern *P. catenulae* isolates form a single, monophyletic clade. Molecular clock analysis, calibrated with host archaeological dates, indicates that the lineage leading to a *P. catenulae* MAG recovered from a Mesolithic (pre-agricultural) individual (dated to 12,000 years ago) diverged from the lineage leading to all Neolithic (post-agricultural) and modern isolates approximately 15,000 years ago.\n\n2.  **Virulence Gene Phylogeny**: A separate phylogenetic tree was constructed for the `cafA` gene. All *P. catenulae* `cafA` sequences (from Neolithic and modern isolates) form a distinct, highly-supported monophyletic group. However, this *P. catenulae* `cafA` clade is found to be deeply nested within a larger clade of `cafA` orthologs from various species of the genus *Tannerella*, another prominent periodontal pathogen. The `cafA` gene was not detected in the Mesolithic *P. catenulae* MAG. Molecular clock dating of the `cafA` gene tree places the divergence of the *P. catenulae* `cafA` lineage from its closest *Tannerella* `cafA` relative at approximately 8,500 years ago.\n\n3.  **Genomic Context**: In all *Tannerella* species analyzed, the `cafA` gene is located in a stable, conserved region of the main chromosome. In all `cafA`-positive *P. catenulae* isolates, the `cafA` gene is located on the chromosome but is immediately flanked by gene remnants characteristic of a mobile Integrative and Conjugative Element (ICE).\n\nBased *only* on the evidence presented, what is the most robust conclusion regarding the evolutionary history of the `cafA` virulence factor in *Porphyromonas catenulae*?\n\nA. The `cafA` gene was present in the last common ancestor of *Porphyromonas* and *Tannerella* and was subsequently lost in most *Porphyromonas* lineages, but retained in the *P. catenulae* lineage since its divergence 15,000 years ago.\n\nB. *P. catenulae* acquired the `cafA` gene from a *Tannerella* species via horizontal gene transfer after the start of the Neolithic revolution.\n\nC. The `cafA` gene arose independently in both *P. catenulae* and *Tannerella* through convergent evolution, driven by the similar environmental pressures of the human oral cavity.\n\nD. The `cafA` gene was originally a *P. catenulae* gene that was transferred to an ancestral *Tannerella* species around 8,500 years ago.\n\nE. The `cafA` gene has been vertically inherited within the *P. catenulae* lineage, and the molecular clock dating of the gene tree is likely flawed, explaining the discrepancy with the species tree.",
            "solution": "We begin with the species phylogeny inference. The concatenated core-protein species tree shows that all ancient and modern Porphyromonas catenulae isolates form a single monophyletic clade, with a divergence between the Mesolithic lineage and the lineage leading to all Neolithic and modern isolates at approximately 15,000 years ago. This establishes a baseline for vertical inheritance expectations for genes present in the lineage prior to 15,000 years ago.\n\nNext, we consider the virulence gene phylogeny for cafA. The cafA sequences from P. catenulae (only in Neolithic and modern isolates) form a monophyletic group but are deeply nested within a broader clade of Tannerella cafA orthologs. Such a topology, where the gene clade of one genus is nested within the diversity of another genus, is a classic signature of horizontal gene transfer rather than vertical inheritance or convergent evolution. Furthermore, the cafA gene was not detected in the Mesolithic P. catenulae MAG. This presence/absence pattern indicates that cafA was not part of the P. catenulae lineage at least as of 12,000 years ago, contradicting any hypothesis of continuous vertical inheritance within P. catenulae since before the Mesolithic.\n\nThird, the molecular clock dating of the cafA gene tree places the split between the P. catenulae cafA lineage and its closest Tannerella cafA relative at approximately 8,500 years ago. This timing postdates the start of the Neolithic revolution (approximately 10,000 years ago) and, combined with the absence of cafA in the Mesolithic P. catenulae MAG, places the acquisition of cafA in P. catenulae after the Mesolithic and within the Neolithic timeframe.\n\nFourth, the genomic context provides mechanistic support for horizontal gene transfer. In Tannerella, cafA resides in a stable, conserved chromosomal region, consistent with long-standing vertical inheritance within Tannerella. In contrast, in all cafA-positive P. catenulae isolates, cafA is chromosomal but flanked by remnants of an integrative and conjugative element (ICE), which are hallmark features of mobile genetic element-mediated acquisition. This differential context strongly favors Tannerella as the long-term host and P. catenulae as the recent recipient via ICE-mediated transfer.\n\nWe now evaluate the options against these lines of evidence:\n- Option A posits ancestral presence with losses in Porphyromonas and retention in P. catenulae since 15,000 years ago. This is contradicted by the absence of cafA in the Mesolithic P. catenulae MAG and by the nested placement within Tannerella, as well as the ICE signatures inconsistent with simple vertical retention.\n- Option B posits horizontal acquisition by P. catenulae from Tannerella after the start of the Neolithic. This is supported by (i) gene-tree nesting within Tannerella, (ii) absence in Mesolithic P. catenulae, (iii) molecular clock timing around 8,500 years ago (postdating the Neolithic onset), and (iv) ICE-flanked genomic context in P. catenulae.\n- Option C invokes convergent evolution. The monophyletic placement of P. catenulae cafA within Tannerella cafA diversity argues for shared ancestry, not independent origins, and the ICE context indicates transfer rather than convergence.\n- Option D claims P. catenulae was the donor to Tannerella around 8,500 years ago. This is contradicted by the topology (P. catenulae cafA nested within Tannerella, not basal to it), the stable chromosomal context in Tannerella suggesting long-term residence, and the absence of cafA in Mesolithic P. catenulae.\n- Option E asserts vertical inheritance within P. catenulae with a flawed molecular clock. Multiple independent lines of evidence—gene-tree incongruence, absence in Mesolithic genomes, and ICE context—oppose vertical inheritance irrespective of clock calibration.\n\nTherefore, the most robust conclusion, based only on the presented evidence, is that P. catenulae acquired cafA from a Tannerella species via horizontal gene transfer after the start of the Neolithic revolution.",
