            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n1.  **Organism Type**: A clinical isolate of a Gram-negative pathogen.\n2.  **Observed Phenomenon**: Rapid efflux of cationic fluorescent dyes (ethidium and acriflavine).\n3.  **Experimental Data (from purified inner membrane vesicles)**:\n    -   Dye efflux is abolished by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), a protonophore that collapses the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$).\n    -   Dye efflux is unaffected by sodium orthovanadate, a transition-state analog inhibitor of adenosine triphosphate ($\\mathrm{ATP}$) hydrolysis.\n4.  **Genomic/Phylogenetic Data**: Homologs of the pump are detected broadly in Gram-negative bacteria but are rarely found or are functionally absent in Gram-positive species.\n5.  **Fundamental Principles (provided for context)**:\n    -   Secondary active transporters couple substrate movement to an electrochemical ion gradient (e.g., the proton motive force, $\\Delta p$).\n    -   Primary active transporters couple to adenosine triphosphate ($\\mathrm{ATP}$) hydrolysis.\n    -   The proton motive force is defined as $\\Delta p=\\Delta \\psi-\\left(\\dfrac{2.303RT}{F}\\right)\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n    -   Many Gram-negative efflux systems are tripartite, spanning the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane.\n    -   Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is a well-constructed question in microbial physiology and biochemistry.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of membrane transport, bioenergetics, and bacterial cell wall structure. The roles of CCCP as a protonophore, vanadate as an ATPase inhibitor, and the different energy sources for primary and secondary transporters are all standard textbook facts. The major efflux pump superfamilies (ABC, RND, MFS, MATE, SMR) and their general characteristics are central to the field of antibiotic resistance. The architectural difference between Gram-negative (with an outer membrane) and Gram-positive (without an outer membrane) bacteria is a foundational concept in microbiology.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The information provided is sufficient, consistent, and structured to allow for a unique, logical deduction. The experimental data (inhibitor effects) constrains the possible energy source, and the phylogenetic/structural data constrains the possible superfamily based on its distribution and architectural requirements.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and free of subjective claims. The data are presented as experimental observations (\"efflux is abolished by...\", \"unaffected by...\"), which form the basis for a logical inference.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a scientifically sound, complete, and objective problem that can be solved by applying first principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to identify the efflux pump superfamily based on the provided experimental and structural information. We will analyze each piece of evidence.\n\n1.  **Energy Source Analysis**: The problem states that the pump's activity is coupled to the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$) and not to $\\mathrm{ATP}$ hydrolysis.\n    -   **Evidence for $\\Delta p$ dependence**: Dye efflux is \"abolished by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP)\". CCCP is a protonophore, a chemical that shuttles protons across the membrane, thereby dissipating the transmembrane proton gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and often the membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$). Together, these components constitute the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$). Abolishing efflux by collapsing $\\Delta p$ demonstrates that the pump is a secondary active transporter that uses the proton gradient as its energy source. As it's an efflux pump, it most likely functions as a drug/$\\mathrm{H}^+$ antiporter, using the influx of protons down their electrochemical gradient to power the efflux of the substrate against its concentration gradient.\n    -   **Evidence against $\\mathrm{ATP}$ dependence**: Dye efflux is \"unaffected by sodium orthovanadate\". Vanadate is a phosphate analog that inhibits several classes of ATPases, including the P-type ATPases and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, by locking them in a post-hydrolysis transition state. Insensitivity to vanadate strongly indicates that the transporter is not a primary active transporter that relies on $\\mathrm{ATP}$ hydrolysis.\n\n    **Conclusion on Energy Source**: The pump is a secondary active transporter that utilizes the proton motive force ($\\Delta p$).\n\n2.  **Structural and Phylogenetic Analysis**: The problem provides clues related to the pump's structure and distribution.\n    -   **Evidence**: The pump is \"broadly in Gram-negative bacteria but are rarely found or are functionally absent in Gram-positive species\". The problem explicitly links this to bacterial envelope architecture, noting that Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane allowing for tripartite systems, while Gram-positives do not.\n\n    **Conclusion on Structure**: This distribution pattern strongly suggests that the pump is an integral component of a tripartite efflux system. Such systems consist of three proteins: an inner membrane transporter (the pump itself), a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP), and an outer membrane factor (OMF). This entire complex spans from the cytoplasm to the cell exterior, allowing Gram-negative bacteria to bypass the periplasm and expel substrates directly into the external medium. The requirement for an outer membrane protein (OMF) explains why these systems are characteristic of Gram-negative bacteria and absent in Gram-positives.\n\n3.  **Synthesis**: We are looking for a superfamily of efflux pumps that are:\n    -   $\\Delta p$-driven secondary active transporters.\n    -   Typically form tripartite systems.\n    -   Are therefore found almost exclusively in Gram-negative bacteria.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe will evaluate each option against the derived profile.\n\n**A. Adenosine Triphosphate-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters; they extrude cationic dyes and are unaffected by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone ($\\mathrm{CCCP}$), consistent with primary active transport, and they are generally absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: ABC transporters are primary active transporters that hydrolyze $\\mathrm{ATP}$ for energy. They would be inhibited by vanadate and would be largely unaffected by CCCP. The problem statement explicitly shows the opposite: the pump is *abolished* by CCCP and *unaffected* by vanadate. Furthermore, ABC transporters are ubiquitous and are found in great numbers in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, so the claim that they are \"generally absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is factually incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) transporters; they are proton motive force ($\\Delta p$)-dependent secondary active antiporters inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, generally insensitive to vanadate because they do not hydrolyze $\\mathrm{ATP}$, and are largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria due to their requirement for a tripartite assembly with an outer-membrane channel.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option matches all the evidence perfectly.\n    -   **Energy Source**: RND transporters are indeed drug/$\\mathrm{H}^+$ antiporters that utilize $\\Delta p$. They are therefore inhibited by protonophores like CCCP and are not inhibited by ATPase inhibitors like vanadate.\n    -   **Structure and Distribution**: The RND family is the archetypal example of transporters that form tripartite efflux systems in Gram-negative bacteria (e.g., AcrAB-TolC in *Escherichia coli*). Their functional reliance on an outer membrane channel (the OMF, e.g., TolC) explains why this family is almost entirely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) transporters; they are $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, not inhibited by vanadate, and are absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: MFS transporters are indeed often $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, which fits the inhibitor profile (CCCP-sensitive, vanadate-insensitive). However, the claim that they are \"absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is patently false. The MFS is one of the largest and most diverse superfamilies of transporters, with numerous members in Gram-positive species that are major contributors to antibiotic resistance (e.g., NorA in *Staphylococcus aureus*). Therefore, MFS transporters do not fit the phylogenetic distribution described in the problem.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Multidrug And Toxic Compound Extrusion (MATE) transporters; they are typically $\\mathrm{Na}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, thus inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$ but not by vanadate, and they are largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: MATE transporters are secondary active antiporters, but they can be coupled to either $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ or $\\mathrm{H}^+$ gradients. The problem's data (abolition by CCCP, a *protonophore*) points more directly to $\\mathrm{H}^+$ coupling than $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ coupling. More importantly, the claim that they are \"largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria\" is false. MATE transporters are found widely in all three domains of life, including in Gram-positive bacteria. Thus, they do not fit the phylogenetic distribution.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Small Multidrug Resistance (SMR) transporters; they are $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled and inhibited by $\\mathrm{CCCP}$, not inhibited by vanadate, and are absent from Gram-positive bacteria.**\n-   **Analysis**: The SMR family consists of small, $\\mathrm{H}^+$-coupled secondary transporters, so the inhibitor profile is consistent with the data. However, as with MFS and MATE, the claim that they are \"absent from Gram-positive bacteria\" is false. The SMR family is found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. They are also single-component inner-membrane proteins (though they form oligomers) and do not form tripartite systems, failing to match the structural inference.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of kinetic data for an efflux pump, assuming it follows the Michaelis–Menten model. The task involves deriving two common linear transformations of the Michaelis–Menten equation, using them to determine the kinetic parameters $V_{\\max}$ (maximum efflux rate) and $K_{m}$ (Michaelis constant), qualitatively assessing the statistical reliability of each transformation, and computing the specificity constant, $V_{\\max}/K_{m}$.\n\nThe standard Michaelis–Menten equation relates the initial rate of reaction, $v$, to the substrate concentration, $[S]$:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum rate at saturating substrate concentration and $K_{m}$ is the substrate concentration at which the rate is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, we will derive and apply the Lineweaver–Burk (LB) transformation. We start by taking the reciprocal of the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_{m} + [S]}{V_{\\max} [S]}$$\nSeparating the terms on the right-hand side yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{v} = \\frac{K_{m}}{V_{\\max} [S]} + \\frac{[S]}{V_{\\max} [S]}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{v} = \\left(\\frac{K_{m}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) \\frac{1}{[S]} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\frac{1}{v}$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\frac{1}{[S]}$.\n- The slope is $m = \\frac{K_{m}}{V_{\\max}}$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}$.\n\nThe given data pairs of $([S], v)$ are:\n($10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $30\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$)\n($20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $48\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$)\n($30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $60\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$)\n($60\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $80\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$)\n($120\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $96\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$)\n\nWe transform these data into Lineweaver–Burk coordinates $(1/[S], 1/v)$:\n- $(1/10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}, 1/30\\ (\\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1})^{-1}) = (0.1, 0.0333...)$\n- $(1/20\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}, 1/48\\ (\\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1})^{-1}) = (0.05, 0.02083...)$\n- $(1/30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}, 1/60\\ (\\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1})^{-1}) \\approx (0.0333, 0.0166...)$\n- $(1/60\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}, 1/80\\ (\\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1})^{-1}) \\approx (0.0167, 0.0125)$\n- $(1/120\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}, 1/96\\ (\\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1})^{-1}) \\approx (0.0083, 0.01041...)$\n\nSince the provided data are noise-free (they perfectly fit the model, as will be shown), we can determine the line's parameters exactly using any two points. Let's use the first and third points.\nSlope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{1/60 - 1/30}{1/30 - 1/10} = \\frac{(1-2)/60}{(1-3)/30} = \\frac{-1/60}{-2/30} = \\frac{-1/60}{-1/15} = \\frac{15}{60} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\nSo, $\\frac{K_{m}}{V_{\\max}} = 0.25$.\nThe y-intercept $c$ can be found using $y = mx + c$:\n$\\frac{1}{30} = (0.25)\\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right) + c \\implies \\frac{1}{30} = \\frac{1}{40} + c \\implies c = \\frac{1}{30} - \\frac{1}{40} = \\frac{4-3}{120} = \\frac{1}{120}$.\nFrom the intercept, $c = \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{120}$, which gives $V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\nUsing the slope, $K_{m} = 0.25 \\times V_{\\max} = 0.25 \\times 120 = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThese parameters are confirmed to fit all other data points perfectly.\n\nNext, we derive and apply the Eadie–Hofstee (EH) transformation to independently verify these parameters. We start again with the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nMultiply both sides by $(K_{m} + [S])$:\n$$v(K_{m} + [S]) = V_{\\max} [S]$$\n$$v K_{m} + v[S] = V_{\\max} [S]$$\nDivide by $[S]$:\n$$v \\frac{K_{m}}{[S]} + v = V_{\\max}$$\nRearrange to match the linear form $y = mx + c$:\n$$v = -K_{m} \\frac{v}{[S]} + V_{\\max}$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = v$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\frac{v}{[S]}$.\n- The slope is $m = -K_{m}$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = V_{\\max}$.\n\nWe transform the original data into Eadie–Hofstee coordinates $(v/[S], v)$:\n- $(30/10, 30) = (3, 30)$\n- $(48/20, 48) = (2.4, 48)$\n- $(60/30, 60) = (2, 60)$\n- $(80/60, 80) \\approx (1.333, 80)$\n- $(96/120, 96) = (0.8, 96)$\n\nAgain, using any two points, we find the slope and intercept. Using points 1 and 3:\nSlope $m = \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{60 - 30}{2 - 3} = \\frac{30}{-1} = -30$.\nFrom the slope, $m = -K_{m} = -30$, which gives $K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\nThe y-intercept $c$ is found using $y = mx + c$:\n$30 = (-30)(3) + c \\implies 30 = -90 + c \\implies c = 120$.\nFrom the intercept, $c = V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.\nThe parameters obtained from the Eadie–Hofstee analysis ($V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$, $K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$) are identical to those from the Lineweaver–Burk analysis, thus providing the required verification.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a qualitative discussion of which linear transformation is more biased, assuming the dominant experimental variance is approximately constant in $v$. Let this constant variance be $\\sigma^2(v) \\approx \\sigma^2$.\n\nThe Lineweaver–Burk (LB) plot uses the transformed variables $y_{LB} = 1/v$ and $x_{LB} = 1/[S]$. Using standard error propagation, the variance of the transformed dependent variable, $\\sigma^2(1/v)$, is approximated by $(\\frac{d(1/v)}{dv})^2 \\sigma^2(v) = (-\\frac{1}{v^2})^2 \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{v^4}$. This transformation makes the variance of the data points highly unequal (heteroscedastic). Measurements at low substrate concentrations, where $v$ is small, will have their errors magnified enormously. For example, a measurement of $v$ at $1/10$ of its maximal value will have an error variance in the LB plot that is $10^4$ times larger than a measurement near saturation. An unweighted linear regression, which assumes equal variance for all points, will be heavily biased by these high-error, high-leverage points at large values of $1/[S]$ and $1/v$.\n\nThe Eadie–Hofstee (EH) plot uses the variables $y_{EH} = v$ and $x_{EH} = v/[S]$. The dependent variable, $y_{EH}$, is $v$ itself. Therefore, its variance is constant, $\\sigma^2(v)=\\sigma^2$, which is ideal for the assumptions of linear regression concerning the dependent variable. However, the independent variable, $x_{EH} = v/[S]$, now contains the experimental error from $v$. The variance of $x_{EH}$ is approximately $\\sigma^2(v)/[S]^2 = \\sigma^2/[S]^2$. Standard linear regression assumes the independent variable is error-free. While the EH plot violates this assumption, the distortion of the error structure is generally less severe than in the LB plot. The LB plot's $1/v^4$ weighting of variance is an extreme distortion. Therefore, under the condition of constant variance in $v$, the **Lineweaver-Burk plot is expected to be significantly more biased** than the Eadie-Hofstee plot.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $V_{\\max}/K_{m}$. Using the consistent values obtained from both methods:\n$V_{\\max} = 120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n$K_{m} = 30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\nThe ratio, often called the specificity constant, is:\n$$\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{m}} = \\frac{120\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{30\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 4\\ \\mathrm{nmol}\\ \\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{min}^{-1}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}^{-1}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\nThus, the final numerical answer is $4.00$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a logical conclusion based on established principles of bacterial physiology and pharmacology.\n\nThe core of this problem is to evaluate the specificity of two efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs), phenyl-arginine β-naphthylamide (PAβN) and reserpine, by interpreting data from a series of well-designed experiments. Intracellular accumulation of a fluorescent dye like ethidium bromide (EtBr) at a quasi-steady state is a balance between its rate of influx across the cell envelope and its rate of active efflux.\n$$\n\\frac{d[\\text{EtBr}]_{\\text{in}}}{dt} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{influx}} - \\text{Rate}_{\\text{efflux}}\n$$\nAt steady state, the net rate of change is zero, so $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{influx}} \\approx \\text{Rate}_{\\text{efflux}}$. An increase in the steady-state intracellular concentration, measured as fluorescence, can result from either an increase in $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{influx}}$ or a decrease in $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{efflux}}$. A specific EPI should only decrease $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{efflux}}$ by directly acting on the pump, without affecting influx or the cell's general energy state.\n\nThe provided data allows for a systematic evaluation of these factors for each compound.\n1.  **Baseline comparison:** The isogenic $\\Delta acrB$ mutant shows a baseline fluorescence of $2.0$, which is higher than the wild-type (WT) baseline of $1.0$. This is expected, as `AcrB` is a principal component of the major multidrug efflux pump AcrAB-TolC in *Escherichia coli*. Its deletion cripples a primary efflux pathway for EtBr, leading to higher basal accumulation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Reserpine:**\n    -   In WT cells, reserpine at $20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ causes a modest increase in fluorescence from $1.0$ to $1.3$. This suggests it is inhibiting efflux, leading to greater accumulation of EtBr.\n    -   In the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant, reserpine causes no change in fluorescence (it remains $2.0$). This is a crucial control. The lack of effect in a strain missing AcrB strongly implies that reserpine's target is the AcrB-containing pump system.\n    -   The N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN) assay shows no change in fluorescence (remains $1.0$), indicating that reserpine at this concentration does not disrupt or permeabilize the outer membrane (OM). This rules out an increase in $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{influx}}$ as the cause of accumulation.\n    -   The membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$) is unchanged ($0\\%$ change), meaning reserpine does not affect the primary energy source for the AcrAB-TolC pump. This rules out a non-specific effect through energy dissipation.\n    -   Conclusion: The data collectively and consistently indicate that reserpine at $20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ acts as a relatively specific inhibitor of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump.\n\n3.  **Analysis of PAβN:**\n    -   In WT cells, PAβN at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ causes a large increase in fluorescence from $1.0$ to $3.0$.\n    -   In the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant, PAβN still causes a significant increase in fluorescence, from $2.0$ to $2.9$. Since the primary target, AcrB, is absent, this proves that PAβN has at least one other mechanism of action that increases dye accumulation. This is an \"off-target\" effect.\n    -   The NPN assay provides the explanation for this off-target effect. NPN fluorescence increases from $1.0$ to $4.0$, which is a classic indicator of significant OM permeabilization. An increase in OM permeability will increase the $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{influx}}$ of EtBr.\n    -   Furthermore, PAβN causes a $15\\%$ decrease in $\\Delta \\psi$. This indicates a partial depolarization of the inner membrane, which reduces the proton motive force (PMF). While this would non-specifically inhibit all PMF-dependent efflux pumps and contribute to increased accumulation, the primary confounding factor is the large increase in permeability.\n    -   Conclusion: PAβN at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ is a non-specific agent. The observed increase in EtBr accumulation in WT cells is a composite of (i) potential inhibition of the AcrAB-TolC pump, (ii) a significant increase in drug influx due to OM permeabilization, and (iii) a general, non-specific reduction in efflux activity due to partial dissipation of the PMF.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this analysis.\n\n**A. The $3.0$-fold increase in ethidium fluorescence in wild-type cells upon addition of PAβN at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ can be attributed solely to inhibition of AcrAB-TolC–mediated efflux.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The data from the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant (fluorescence increase from $2.0$ to $2.9$) and the NPN assay (fluorescence increase from $1.0$ to $4.0$) prove that PAβN has significant off-target effects, most notably membrane permeabilization, which increases influx. Therefore, the effect cannot be attributed \"solely\" to efflux inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ PAβN condition likely increases outer membrane permeability, so the increased ethidium fluorescence cannot be attributed solely to efflux inhibition without additional controls to disentangle permeability from efflux.**\nThis statement is strongly supported by the data. The NPN assay result (fluorescence increase from $1.0$ to $4.0$) is direct evidence that PAβN at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ increases OM permeability. This permeabilization increases dye influx, which is a confounding variable. Consequently, the observed fluorescence increase in WT cells is a combination of effects, and one cannot attribute it solely to efflux inhibition based on this experiment alone.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The modest increase in wild-type ethidium fluorescence with reserpine at $20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, together with no change in the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant and unchanged NPN signal, most parsimoniously reflects inhibition of an efflux function present in wild-type but absent in the $\\Delta acrB$ strain, rather than altered permeability at this concentration.**\nThis is an accurate and logical interpretation of the reserpine data. The effect of reserpine is observed only in the WT strain ($1.0 \\to 1.3$) and is absent in the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant, pointing to AcrB as the target. The unchanged NPN signal confirms that permeability is not altered. The unchanged $\\Delta \\psi$ confirms no general energy disruption. Therefore, the principle of parsimony (simplest explanation) supports specific inhibition of an AcrB-dependent function.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. The increase in ethidium fluorescence in the $\\Delta acrB$ mutant upon PAβN addition indicates that PAβN’s effect includes a permeability component; therefore, in wild-type cells, increased accumulation with PAβN cannot be interpreted as pure efflux inhibition.**\nThis statement presents a sound logical deduction. The effect of PAβN in the $\\Delta acrB$ strain (fluorescence increase from $2.0$ to $2.9$) demonstrates an effect independent of AcrB. This effect is best explained as increased influx due to membrane permeabilization, which is confirmed by the NPN assay. Since this effect occurs in the mutant, it must also occur in the wild-type. Therefore, the effect in the wild-type is necessarily a mixed one and cannot be considered \"pure efflux inhibition.\"\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Because PAβN causes a $15\\%$ decrease in $\\Delta \\psi$, any increase in ethidium accumulation must reflect reduced influx, proving that efflux was specifically inhibited by PAβN.**\nThis statement is flawed in its reasoning. First, a decrease in $\\Delta \\psi$ would decrease the energy for PMF-dependent efflux, which would lead to *increased* accumulation, not decreased. Second, claiming that an increase in accumulation must reflect *reduced influx* is a contradiction; reduced influx would lead to lower accumulation. Third, dissipating the PMF is a *non-specific* mechanism affecting many cellular processes and does not \"prove\" *specific* inhibition of a particular pump. The logic of this statement is entirely incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
