Mobile genetic elements like Insertion Sequences can provide new promoters that dramatically upregulate resistance genes.

            "problem": "A clinical isolate of a bacterial pathogen acquires an Insertion Sequence (IS) element upstream of a chromosomal antibiotic resistance gene. The IS carries an outward-facing promoter that increases the gene’s transcription rate by a factor of $8$ relative to the ancestral strain. Assume steady-state messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) abundance $M$ is proportional to transcription rate and that mRNA degradation kinetics are unchanged by the IS insertion. The resistance phenotype is quantified by the Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), denoted $I$. Over the relevant operating range, an empirically established elasticity relates MIC to transcript abundance via a constant exponent $\\alpha$ defined by\n$$\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{d \\ln I}{d \\ln M}.$$\nAssume $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$ is valid across the $8$-fold change in $M$ caused by the IS-provided promoter.\n\nStarting from the definition of elasticity and using only standard facts from the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), derive the closed-form relationship between the MIC fold-change and the transcript fold-change. Then compute the expected MIC fold increase given the $8$-fold increase in $M$. Express your final result as a unitless fold-change and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form relationship between the fold-change in Minimal Inhibitory Concentration ($I$) and the fold-change in messenger RNA abundance ($M$), starting from the definition of elasticity, $\\alpha$.\n\nThe elasticity is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{d \\ln I}{d \\ln M} $$\nThis is a differential equation relating the natural logarithm of $I$ to the natural logarithm of $M$. We are given that $\\alpha$ is a constant, specifically $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables:\n$$ d \\ln I = \\alpha \\, d \\ln M $$\nTo find the relationship between the initial and final states, we integrate this equation from the ancestral state (denoted by subscript $0$) to the new state with the IS element (denoted by subscript $1$).\n$$ \\int_{\\ln I_0}^{\\ln I_1} d(\\ln I) = \\int_{\\ln M_0}^{\\ln M_1} \\alpha \\, d(\\ln M) $$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a constant, it can be taken outside the integral on the right side:\n$$ \\int_{\\ln I_0}^{\\ln I_1} d(\\ln I) = \\alpha \\int_{\\ln M_0}^{\\ln M_1} d(\\ln M) $$\nThe integrals are elementary: $\\int d x = x$. Evaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$ [\\ln I]_{\\ln I_0}^{\\ln I_1} = \\alpha [\\ln M]_{\\ln M_0}^{\\ln M_1} $$\n$$ \\ln(I_1) - \\ln(I_0) = \\alpha \\left( \\ln(M_1) - \\ln(M_0) \\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we can simplify the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_1}{I_0}\\right) = \\alpha \\ln\\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_0}\\right) $$\nThis equation relates the logarithm of the fold-change in $I$ to the logarithm of the fold-change in $M$. To find the closed-form relationship for the fold-changes themselves, we can use another logarithmic property, $c \\ln(a) = \\ln(a^c)$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{I_1}{I_0}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_0}\\right)^\\alpha\\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides of the equation with base $e$ gives the final closed-form relationship:\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} = \\left(\\frac{M_1}{M_0}\\right)^\\alpha $$\nThis is the derived relationship between the MIC fold-change ($\\frac{I_1}{I_0}$) and the transcript fold-change ($\\frac{M_1}{M_0}$).\n\nNext, we compute the expected MIC fold increase. The problem states that the transcription rate increases by a factor of $8$. Since the steady-state mRNA abundance $M$ is proportional to the transcription rate (i.e., $M = k \\times \\text{transcription rate}$ for some constant $k$), the fold-change in $M$ is also $8$:\n$$ \\frac{M_1}{M_0} = \\frac{k \\times (\\text{rate}_1)}{k \\times (\\text{rate}_0)} = \\frac{8 \\times (\\text{rate}_0)}{(\\text{rate}_0)} = 8 $$\nWe are given the value of the elasticity exponent:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} = (8)^{\\frac{1}{2}} $$\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} = \\sqrt{8} $$\nTo express this as a numerical value, we calculate the square root of $8$:\n$$ \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 2} = 2\\sqrt{2} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} \\approx 2 \\times 1.41421356... = 2.82842712... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $8$, and $2$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the third digit.\n$$ \\frac{I_1}{I_0} \\approx 2.83 $$\nThe expected MIC fold increase is $2.83$.",

            "introduction": "For resistance to become widespread, the mobile genetic elements that carry resistance genes, such as plasmids, must be stably inherited. Bacteria have evolved fascinating \"plasmid addiction\" modules, known as toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems, which ensure that cells that lose the plasmid are killed. This practice  uses basic probability to calculate the effectiveness of such a system, revealing how it dramatically reduces the rate of plasmid loss and promotes the persistence of resistance in a population.",

            "problem": "A clinical isolate of a bacterial pathogen carries a conjugative plasmid encoding multiple antibiotic resistance genes. During cell division, plasmid partitioning errors can generate plasmid-free progeny (segregants). Post-segregational killing is mediated by a plasmid-encoded toxin-antitoxin (TA) system, which kills plasmid-free cells because they no longer produce the antitoxin supplied by the plasmid. Assume the following:\n\n1. In any given division, the probability that a plasmid-free segregant is produced is $p = 0.02$.\n2. Conditional on a progeny cell being plasmid-free, the TA system kills that cell with probability $k = 0.9$.\n3. Killing events act independently of the initial segregation event and are specific to plasmid-free cells.\n\nUsing the multiplication rule for probabilities of sequential events, derive from first principles the effective per-division rate at which the lineage loses plasmid-encoded resistance due to the emergence of a viable plasmid-free cell. Express your final answer as a single real-valued number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the effective per-division rate at which a viable, plasmid-free cell emerges. This is equivalent to finding the joint probability of two sequential events:\n1.  A progeny cell is plasmid-free.\n2.  This plasmid-free cell survives the post-segregational killing mechanism.\n\nLet us define the events formally.\nLet $S$ be the event that a progeny cell is a plasmid-free segregant. From the problem statement, the probability of this event is given as:\n$$P(S) = p = 0.02$$\n\nLet $V$ be the event that a progeny cell is viable (i.e., it survives). We are interested in the survival of a plasmid-free cell. The problem provides the probability of a plasmid-free cell being killed by the TA system. Let $K$ be the event that a plasmid-free cell is killed. The problem gives this as a conditional probability:\n$$P(K|S) = k = 0.9$$\nThe event that a plasmid-free cell is viable, $V$, is the complement of the event that it is killed, $K$, given that it is plasmid-free. Therefore, the probability of a plasmid-free cell surviving is:\n$$P(V|S) = 1 - P(K|S) = 1 - k$$\nSubstituting the given value of $k$:\n$$P(V|S) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$$\n\nThe objective is to find the probability that a cell is both plasmid-free and viable. This is the probability of the intersection of events $S$ and $V$, denoted as $P(S \\cap V)$.\n\nThe problem explicitly instructs to use the multiplication rule for probabilities, which states that for any two events $A$ and $B$, the probability of their intersection is $P(A \\cap B) = P(B|A)P(A)$.\nApplying this rule to our defined events $S$ and $V$:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = P(V|S) P(S)$$\nWe have already determined the expressions for the probabilities on the right-hand side. Substituting these expressions gives the symbolic form of the answer:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = (1 - k)p$$\nThis expression represents the effective per-division rate of the emergence of viable, plasmid-free cells.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement, $p = 0.02$ and $k = 0.9$, into this expression:\n$$P(S \\cap V) = (1 - 0.9) \\times 0.02$$\n$$P(S \\cap V) = 0.1 \\times 0.02$$\n$$P(S \\cap V) = 0.002$$\n\nThus, the effective per-division rate at which a viable, plasmid-free cell emerges is $0.002$.
