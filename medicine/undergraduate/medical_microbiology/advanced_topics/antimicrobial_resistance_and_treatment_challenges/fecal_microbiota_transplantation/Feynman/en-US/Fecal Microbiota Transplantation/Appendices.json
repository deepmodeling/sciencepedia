            "introduction": "A primary goal of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) is to restore a healthy, diverse gut ecosystem from a state of dysbiosis. To track this restoration, we need quantitative tools. The Shannon index is a cornerstone of ecology that measures biodiversity by accounting for both the number of different species (richness) and their relative population sizes (evenness). This practice provides a direct application of this principle, allowing you to calculate and compare the diversity of a hypothetical patient's gut microbiota before and after FMT, thereby quantifying the treatment's ecological impact.",

            "problem": "A clinical research lab is evaluating the impact of Fecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) on gut microbial diversity in a patient with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. They obtained high-quality amplicon sequencing counts for two fecal communities: one before FMT (Community A) and one after FMT (Community B). For each community, the taxa and read counts are as follows, where each community’s total is the sum of its listed counts.\n\nCommunity A (pre-FMT) counts:\n- Bacteroides: $2800$\n- Prevotella: $2200$\n- Faecalibacterium: $1500$\n- Clostridium sensu stricto: $1200$\n- Escherichia/Shigella: $800$\n- Other obligate anaerobes: $500$\n\nCommunity B (post-FMT) counts:\n- Bacteroides: $1700$\n- Prevotella: $1600$\n- Faecalibacterium: $1500$\n- Clostridium sensu stricto: $1400$\n- Escherichia/Shigella: $1400$\n- Other obligate anaerobes: $1400$\n\nUsing the core ecological definition of Shannon diversity, the Shannon index $H$ for a community with species-level relative abundances $\\{p_i\\}$ is\n$$\nH \\;=\\; -\\sum_{i} p_i \\,\\ln(p_i),\n$$\nwhere $\\ln$ denotes the natural logarithm, and $p_i = n_i/N$ with $n_i$ the count for species $i$ and $N$ the community total.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in established ecological principles, mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation and comparison of the Shannon diversity index for two microbial communities, A (pre-FMT) and B (post-FMT). The Shannon index, $H$, is a metric used in ecology to quantify the diversity within a community. It accounts for both the number of different species (richness) and their relative abundances (evenness). The formula is given as:\n$$\nH = -\\sum_{i=1}^{S} p_i \\ln(p_i)\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the number of species (taxa), $p_i$ is the relative abundance of species $i$, and $\\ln$ is the natural logarithm. The relative abundance $p_i$ is calculated as $p_i = n_i / N$, where $n_i$ is the number of individuals of species $i$ (read count) and $N$ is the total number of individuals in the community.

This is consistent with a successful FMT, which aims to restore a healthy, diverse gut microbiota. The increased diversity in this case is due to greater evenness, as the relative abundances of the taxa in Community B are more similar to each other than in Community A, where a few taxa are highly dominant.\n\n**Task 3: Define and compute the difference $\\Delta H = H_B - H_A$**\nThe difference in Shannon diversity is defined as $\\Delta H = H_B - H_A$.

            "problem": "In fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), clinicians often quantify the viable donor microbiota administered as colony-forming units (CFU). Consider a conceptual model in which the clinical efficacy, denoted by $E$ and interpreted as a dimensionless fraction between $0$ and $1$, increases monotonically with dose $D$ (measured in CFU) and saturates at a maximal efficacy $E_{\\max}$. Assume a simple law-of-mass-action framework for engraftment into a finite set of identical, independent ecological niches, with the following foundational definitions and constraints: (i) efficacy is proportional to the fraction of occupied niches at equilibrium, (ii) the half-maximal effective dose $ED_{50}$ is defined such that $E$ equals $\\frac{E_{\\max}}{2}$ at $D=ED_{50}$, and (iii) the response saturates to $E_{\\max}$ as $D \\to \\infty$ and is $0$ at $D=0$.

            "solution": "This problem requires the derivation of a dose-response relationship for FMT efficacy using a model analogous to receptor-ligand binding kinetics, followed by a numerical calculation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Dose-Response Model**\n\nThe model describes the engraftment of donor microbiota (dose, $D$) into a finite number of independent ecological niches. This can be represented as a reversible binding process:\n$$\n\\text{Dose} + \\text{Unoccupied Niche} \\rightleftharpoons \\text{Occupied Niche}\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the fraction of occupied niches, $f$, as a function of dose $D$ follows the law of mass action, which results in a hyperbolic binding curve:\n$$\nf(D) = \\frac{D}{K_D + D}\n$$\nwhere $K_D$ is the dissociation constant, representing the dose at which half of the niches are occupied.\n\nThe problem states that efficacy, $E$, is proportional to the fraction of occupied niches. Let the proportionality constant be $E_{\\max}$, which represents the maximal efficacy when all available niches contributing to the effect are occupied ($D \\to \\infty$).\n$$\nE(D) = E_{\\max} \\cdot f(D) = E_{\\max} \\frac{D}{K_D + D}\n$$\nThis equation satisfies the condition that $E=0$ when $D=0$ and $E \\to E_{\\max}$ as $D \\to \\infty$.\n\nNext, we use the definition of the half-maximal effective dose, $ED_{50}$. At dose $D = ED_{50}$, the efficacy is $E = E_{\\max}/2$. Substituting this into our model:\n$$\n\\frac{E_{\\max}}{2} = E_{\\max} \\frac{ED_{50}}{K_D + ED_{50}}\n$$\nAssuming $E_{\\max} \\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $E_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{ED_{50}}{K_D + ED_{50}}\n$$\n$$\nK_D + ED_{50} = 2 \\cdot ED_{50}\n$$\n$$\nK_D = ED_{50}\n$$\nThis shows that the dissociation constant $K_D$ in our mechanistic model is equivalent to the phenomenological parameter $ED_{50}$.\n\nBy substituting $K_D = ED_{50}$ back into the efficacy equation, we arrive at the final analytic expression:\n$$\nE(D) = E_{\\max} \\frac{D}{ED_{50} + D}\n$$\n\n**2.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the post-test probability that a donor has a specific pathogen, given a negative test result. This is a classic application of Bayes' theorem in the context of medical diagnostics.\n\nFirst, we must formally define the events and probabilities based on the problem statement.\nLet $D$ denote the event that the donor has the pathogen.\nLet $D^c$ denote the event that the donor does not have the pathogen.\nLet $T^-$ denote the event that the laboratory screening result is negative.\nLet $T^+$ denote the event that the laboratory screening result is positive.\n\nThe givens can be translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe pretest prevalence of the pathogen is $1$ in $10{,}000$. This is the prior probability of a donor having the pathogen, $P(D)$.\n$$P(D) = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001$$\nThe probability of a donor not having the pathogen is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.0001 = 0.9999$$\n\nThe test sensitivity is given as $99.5\\%$.

This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^-)$.\n\nWe will derive this probability using Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(D | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D) \\cdot P(D)}{P(T^-)}$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need to determine the values for the terms on the right-hand side.\nThe term $P(D)$ is the prevalence, which is given as $0.0001$.\nThe term $P(T^- | D)$ is the probability of a negative test given that the donor has the pathogen. This is the complement of the sensitivity. Since a donor with the pathogen can either test positive or negative, the sum of these probabilities is $1$.\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$$\nThis value is also known as the false negative rate of the test.\n\nThe term $P(T^-)$ is the total probability of obtaining a negative test result, regardless of the donor's true disease status.
