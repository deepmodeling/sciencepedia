The problem describes the process of negative selection in the thymus, a core concept in immunology. The categories of self-antigens (ubiquitous, tissue-restricted via AIRE, etc.) and the idea that antigen display probability dictates deletion are fundamentally correct and well-established in medical microbiology and immunology. The values for frequencies and probabilities seem plausible within a simplified model.\n2.  **Well-Posed?** Yes. The problem asks for the expected fraction of eliminated autoreactive T cells. The provided data (frequencies and probabilities) are sufficient to calculate this expectation using the law of total probability. A unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objective?** Yes. The language is precise and uses established scientific terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness?** No. The premises are sound.\n5.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant?** No. The problem is directly formalizable using probability theory and is relevant to the specified topic (immunological self-tolerance).\n6.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup?** No. The setup is complete. Let me check if the frequencies sum to 1. $f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4 + f_5 = 0.22 + 0.38 + 0.12 + 0.18 + 0.10 = 0.60 + 0.12 + 0.18 + 0.10 = 0.72 + 0.18 + 0.10 = 0.90 + 0.10 = 1.00$. The frequencies are consistent and sum to $1$, as stated. The probabilities $p_i$ are all between $0$ and $1$, which is correct. There are no contradictions.\n7.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible?** No. The model is a simplification, but the conditions and data are not physically impossible or scientifically implausible. The probabilities reflect current understanding: ubiquitous antigens are highly likely to be presented ($p_1=0.95$), while peripheral-only antigens are very unlikely to be presented in the thymus ($p_5=0.05$). AIRE-dependent antigens have a lower but significant probability of presentation ($p_2=0.65$), which is also consistent with the known function of AIRE.\n8.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured?** No. The question is clearly stated.\n9.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological?** No. The problem requires a straightforward application of probability theory, but it is not trivial. It tests the understanding of how to combine probabilities from different sub-populations to find an overall average or expectation.\n10. **Outside Scientific Verifiability?** No. The calculation is based on standard probability theory.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is **valid**.\n\nNow, I will proceed to solve it.\n\n**Solution Plan:**\nThe problem asks for the expected fraction of autoreactive T cells eliminated by negative selection. This can be interpreted as the overall probability that a randomly chosen autoreactive T cell is eliminated.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a randomly chosen autoreactive T cell is eliminated.\nLet $C_i$ be the event that the T cell belongs to category $i$, for $i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nThe problem gives us the frequencies $\\{f_i\\}$, which are the probabilities that a randomly chosen autoreactive T cell belongs to category $i$. So, $P(C_i) = f_i$.\nThe categories are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, which means $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} P(C_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} f_i = 1$.\n\nThe problem also gives us the probability $p_i$ that the cognate self-antigen is displayed at a sufficient level to induce deletion, for a clone specific to category $i$. This is the conditional probability of elimination given that the cell is in category $i$. So, $P(E | C_i) = p_i$.\n\nWe need to compute the total probability of elimination, $P(E)$. The law of total probability states:\n$P(E) = \\sum_{i} P(E | C_i) P(C_i)$\n\nIn our notation, this is:\n$P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i f_i$\n\nThis value $P(E)$ represents the expected fraction of autoreactive T cells that are eliminated.\n\nLet me plug in the given values:\n$f_1 = 0.22$, $p_1 = 0.95$\n$f_2 = 0.38$, $p_2 = 0.65$\n$f_3 = 0.12$, $p_3 = 0.30$\n$f_4 = 0.18$, $p_4 = 0.15$\n$f_5 = 0.10$, $p_5 = 0.05$\n\nCalculation:\n$P(E) = f_1 p_1 + f_2 p_2 + f_3 p_3 + f_4 p_4 + f_5 p_5$\n$P(E) = (0.22)(0.95) + (0.38)(0.65) + (0.12)(0.30) + (0.18)(0.15) + (0.10)(0.05)$\n\nLet's do the multiplication for each term:\n$f_1 p_1 = 0.22 \\times 0.95 = 0.209$\n$f_2 p_2 = 0.38 \\times 0.65 = 0.247$\n$f_3 p_3 = 0.12 \\times 0.30 = 0.036$\n$f_4 p_4 = 0.18 \\times 0.15 = 0.027$\n$f_5 p_5 = 0.10 \\times 0.05 = 0.005$\n\nNow, sum these products:\n$P(E) = 0.209 + 0.247 + 0.036 + 0.027 + 0.005$\n$P(E) = 0.456 + 0.036 + 0.027 + 0.005$\n$P(E) = 0.492 + 0.027 + 0.005$\n$P(E) = 0.519 + 0.005$\n$P(E) = 0.524$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. My result, $0.524$, already has three significant figures. So, no further rounding is needed.\n\nThe final answer is $0.524$.\n\n**Detailed explanation structure:**\n1.  State the problem asks for the expected fraction of eliminated autoreactive T cells.\n2.  Define the relevant events and probabilities based on the problem statement.\n    - Let $C_i$ be the event that a randomly selected autoreactive T cell belongs to category $i$. The probability is given by the frequency $f_i$, so $P(C_i) = f_i$.\n    - Let $E$ be the event that an autoreactive T cell is eliminated.\n    - The probability that a T cell from category $i$ is eliminated is given as $p_i$. This is the conditional probability $P(E|C_i) = p_i$.\n3.  Explain that since the categories $\\{C_i\\}$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the law of total probability can be applied to find the overall probability of elimination, $P(E)$.\n4.  Write the formula for the law of total probability: $P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} P(E|C_i)P(C_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i f_i$.\n5.  Explain that this total probability $P(E)$ is equivalent to the expected fraction of the total population that is eliminated. This is because for an indicator random variable $I_j$ for the $j$-th cell (where $I_j=1$ if eliminated, $0$ otherwise), the expected number of eliminated cells is $E[\\sum_j I_j] = \\sum_j E[I_j] = \\sum_j P(I_j=1) = N \\times P(E)$, where $N$ is the total number of cells. The expected fraction is then $(N \\times P(E)) / N = P(E)$.\n6.  Substitute the given values for $f_i$ and $p_i$ into the formula.\n7.  Perform the calculation step-by-step.\n8.  State the final numerical result and apply the required rounding to three significant figures.\n\nAll mathematical entities must be in LaTeX.\n- $f_i$, $p_i$, $C_i$, $E$, $P(E)$, $P(C_i)$, $P(E|C_i)$.\n- Numbers: $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $0.22$, $0.95$, $0.38$, $0.65$, $0.12$, $0.30$, $0.18$, $0.15$, $0.10$, $0.05$.\n- Summation: $\\sum$.\n- Result: $0.524$.\n\nLooks good. The logic is sound and the calculation is straightforward. The validation was successful and the problem is well-posed. I will now write the full response following the required structure.\nThe problem requires the calculation of the expected fraction of autoreactive T cells eliminated by negative selection in the thymus. This can be understood as the overall probability of a randomly selected autoreactive T cell being eliminated.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the problem. Let $E$ be the event that a randomly chosen autoreactive T cell is eliminated. The population of autoreactive T cells is partitioned into $5$ mutually exclusive and exhaustive categories. Let $C_i$ be the event that a T cell belongs to category $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nThe problem provides the frequencies $\\{f_i\\}$ of these categories. The frequency $f_i$ is the probability that a randomly selected autoreactive T cell belongs to category $i$. Thus, we have:\n$P(C_i) = f_i$\n\nThe problem also provides the probabilities $\\{p_i\\}$, where $p_i$ is the probability that a T cell from category $i$ is eliminated. This is a conditional probability: the probability of elimination $E$ given that the cell belongs to category $C_i$. We can write this as:\n$P(E | C_i) = p_i$\n\nThe categories $\\{C_i\\}$ are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, which means they form a partition of the sample space of autoreactive T cells. Therefore, we can apply the law of total probability to find the overall probability of elimination, $P(E)$. The law states:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} P(E|C_i) P(C_i)$$\n\nSubstituting the given notation, the formula becomes:\n$$P(E) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_i f_i$$\n\nThis probability, $P(E)$, represents the fraction of the total population of autoreactive T cells that is expected to be eliminated. To see this, consider an indicator random variable $X$ for a single cell, where $X=1$ if the cell is eliminated and $X=0$ otherwise. The expectation of $X$ is $E[X] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X=0) = P(E)$. For a large population, the expected fraction of eliminated cells is equal to this probability.\n\nThe given data are:\nFor category $1$ (Ubiquitous): $f_1 = 0.22$, $p_1 = 0.95$\nFor category $2$ (AIRE-dependent TRA): $f_2 = 0.38$, $p_2 = 0.65$\nFor category $3$ (AIRE-independent TRA): $f_3 = 0.12$, $p_3 = 0.30$\nFor category $4$ (Post-translationally modified): $f_4 = 0.18$, $p_4 = 0.15$\nFor category $5$ (Peripheral-only): $f_5 = 0.10$, $p_5 = 0.05$\n\nWe can now compute the sum of the products $p_i f_i$:\n$$P(E) = f_1 p_1 + f_2 p_2 + f_3 p_3 + f_4 p_4 + f_5 p_5$$\n$$P(E) = (0.22)(0.95) + (0.38)(0.65) + (0.12)(0.30) + (0.18)(0.15) + (0.10)(0.05)$$\n\nLet's calculate each term individually:\nThe contribution from category $1$ is $0.22 \\times 0.95 = 0.209$.\nThe contribution from category $2$ is $0.38 \\times 0.65 = 0.247$.\nThe contribution from category $3$ is $0.12 \\times 0.30 = 0.036$.\nThe contribution from category $4$ is $0.18 \\times 0.15 = 0.027$.\nThe contribution from category $5$ is $0.10 \\times 0.05 = 0.005$.\n\nNow, we sum these contributions to find the total probability:\n$$P(E) = 0.209 + 0.247 + 0.036 + 0.027 + 0.005$$\n$$P(E) = 0.524$$\n\nThis value represents the expected fraction of autoreactive T cells eliminated by negative selection. The problem asks for the answer as a single decimal number rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.524$ already has exactly three significant figures ($5$, $2$, and $4$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\n\nThe expected fraction of eliminated autoreactive T cells is $0.524$.",

Consider a simplified, monotonic mapping from TCR–pMHC affinity to fate: let TCR affinity be a scalar $a \\ge 0$. Assume there exist two ($2$) affinity thresholds $a_1$ and $a_2$ with $0a_1a_2$ such that, for a fixed cytokine environment, the following outcomes occur: if $aa_1$ the cell becomes a conventional T cell (Tconv); if $a_1aa_2$ the cell becomes a thymus-derived regulatory T cell (tTreg); if $aa_2$ the cell undergoes deletion by negative selection. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) availability is represented by a nonnegative scalar $I \\ge 0$. Use the following well-tested principles as the fundamental base for your reasoning: (i) TCR signal strength increases monotonically with $a$, and high signal strength promotes negative selection via pro-apoptotic programs; (ii) TCR signals of intermediate-to-high strength can prime precursors that are competent to become tTreg by inducing interleukin-2 receptor alpha (CD25) and transcriptional accessibility at the Foxp3 locus; (iii) IL-2 activates Janus kinase (JAK)–Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5), which both promotes survival (for example, via B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family induction) and directly supports Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression; (iv) these IL-2–derived signals act synergistically with TCR signaling. In a minimal phenomenological model consistent with these principles, one can describe the boundary for tTreg induction as the set of $(a,I)$ where a composite “Foxp3-driving” signal crosses a threshold, and the boundary for deletion as the set of $(a,I)$ where a composite “death-driving” signal crosses a threshold.

            "solution": "We are asked to reason from first principles about how interleukin-2 (IL-2) availability $I$ should shift two ($2$) T cell receptor (TCR) affinity thresholds, $a_1(I)$ and $a_2(I)$, that delimit three fates as a function of affinity $a$: conventional T cell (Tconv) when $aa_1(I)$, thymus-derived regulatory T cell (tTreg) when $a_1(I)aa_2(I)$, and deletion when $aa_2(I)$. The base principles are: TCR signal strength grows with $a$; high TCR signal alone promotes apoptosis (negative selection); intermediate-to-high TCR signals can prime a tTreg-competent precursor state; IL-2 via Janus kinase (JAK)–Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5) both enhances survival and directly promotes Forkhead box P3 (Foxp3) expression; and IL-2 synergizes with TCR signaling.\n\nWe formalize this minimally without committing to specific functional forms, to preserve generality. Let the “Foxp3-driving” input be an increasing function $F(a,I)$ with $\\partial F/\\partial a0$ and $\\partial F/\\partial I0$, reflecting synergy of TCR and IL-2 signals in promoting tTreg differentiation. Let the “death-driving” input be an increasing function of TCR and a decreasing function of IL-2, $D(a,I)$ with $\\partial D/\\partial a0$ and $\\partial D/\\partial I0$, reflecting that stronger TCR signals promote deletion while IL-2 supports survival. Define two ($2$) fixed thresholds: a Foxp3 induction threshold $\\Theta_F0$ and a deletion threshold $\\Theta_D0$. The tTreg window consists of values of $a$ for which $F(a,I)\\ge \\Theta_F$ (tTreg-competent) and $D(a,I)\\Theta_D$ (not deleted). For a fixed $I$, the lower boundary $a_1(I)$ is the minimal $a$ such that $F(a_1(I),I)=\\Theta_F$ and $D(a_1(I),I)\\Theta_D$. The upper boundary $a_2(I)$ is the maximal $a$ such that $D(a_2(I),I)=\\Theta_D$ while still $F(a_2(I),I)\\ge\\Theta_F$.\n\nWe now differentiate the implicit definitions with respect to $I$ using the implicit function theorem.

Conversely, reduced IL-2 shrinks the window by increasing $a_1$ and decreasing $a_2$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. $a_1$ increases and $a_2$ increases. This implies more IL-2 would demand higher TCR affinity to induce tTreg (contrary to IL-2’s role in aiding Foxp3 induction) while also allowing higher affinity before deletion (partially consistent with survival support). Because the first clause contradicts $\\frac{d a_1}{d I}0$, this is Incorrect.\n\nB. $a_1$ decreases and $a_2$ increases. This matches $\\frac{d a_1}{d I}0$ and $\\frac{d a_2}{d I}0$ derived above: IL-2 lowers the tTreg induction threshold and raises the deletion threshold, widening the tTreg window. Correct.\n\nC. $a_1$ decreases and $a_2$ decreases. The first clause matches the effect of IL-2 on Foxp3 induction, but the second contradicts the survival-promoting action of IL-2 with respect to deletion. This is Incorrect.\n\nD. $a_1$ increases and $a_2$ decreases. Both directions are opposite to the derived effects and would imply that IL-2 both impairs tTreg induction and enhances deletion, which is inconsistent with known IL-2 biology.

Since $C' = C_0$, it directly follows that $n(C') = n(C_0)$.\nTherefore, the ratio of the active NFAT fractions is:\n$$\n\\frac{n(C')}{n(C_0)} = 1\n$$\nThis simplifies the expression for the fold-change $F$ to depend only on the change in AP-1 activity:\n$$\nF = \\frac{a(M_0)}{a(M')}\n$$\nThe active fraction of AP-1, $a(M)$, is given by the cooperative Hill equation:\n$$\na(M) = \\frac{M^{h}}{K_M^{h} + M^{h}}\n$$\nWe can now calculate the values for $a(M_0)$ and $a(M')$. The problem provides the following parameters: baseline MAPK activity $M_0 = 1$, Hill coefficient $h = 2$, and the constant $K_M = 0.5$. For calculations involving fractions, it is best to convert decimals to fractions: $K_M = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline activity $a(M_0)$:\n$$\na(M_0) = \\frac{M_0^{h}}{K_M^{h} + M_0^{h}} = \\frac{1^{2}}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{2} + 1^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1+4}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{4}} = \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\nNext, we determine the perturbed MAPK activity, $M'$. The inhibition fraction is given as $I = 0.8$, or $I = \\frac{4}{5}$. The perturbed activity is $M' = (1 - I) M_0$.\n$$\nM' = \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the perturbed AP-1 activity $a(M')$ using $M' = \\frac{1}{5}$:\n$$\na(M') = \\frac{(M')^{h}}{K_M^{h} + (M')^{h}} = \\frac{(\\frac{1}{5})^{2}}{(\\frac{1}{2})^{2} + (\\frac{1}{5})^{2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{25}}{\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{25}}\n$$\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $100$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{25}{100} + \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{29}{100}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $a(M')$:\n$$\na(M') = \\frac{\\frac{1}{25}}{\\frac{29}{100}} = \\frac{1}{25} \\cdot \\frac{100}{29} = \\frac{4}{29}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the fold-change $F$ by taking the ratio of $a(M_0)$ to $a(M')$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{a(M_0)}{a(M')} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{5}}{\\frac{4}{29}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\cdot \\frac{29}{4} = \\frac{29}{5}\n$$\nThe result is a unitless number, as required. The increase in the ratio ($F  1$) indicates that inhibiting MAPK signaling shifts the balance towards NFAT dominance, which, according to the model's premise, promotes anergy.",
