However, not every cell exposed to the virus will be successfully transduced. This exercise  uses the Poisson distribution, a fundamental tool in probability theory, to model this stochastic process and predict the fraction of cells that will express the antigen based on the multiplicity of infection (MOI). Mastering this calculation provides a quantitative foundation for understanding and optimizing the efficiency of gene delivery systems.",

            "problem": "A replication-deficient adenoviral vector is used to deliver a gene encoding a viral antigen to a homogeneous population of mammalian cells in vitro. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is defined as the mean number of viral particles added per cell and is denoted by $m$. Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- Each cell receives an integer number $K$ of viral particles, where $K$ is a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution with mean $m$, justified by independent and rare viral particle–cell encounters at the time of inoculation.\n- A single successful genome delivery event ($K \\geq 1$) is sufficient to initiate antigen expression via the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, and multiple delivery events do not change the binary outcome of expression on a per-cell basis.\n- Delivery events to different cells are independent.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the definition of the Poisson distribution, derive an expression for the expected fraction of cells that become transduced (i.e., receive at least one viral genome) as a function of $m$. Then evaluate this fraction at $m = 3$. Express the final fraction as a decimal and round to four significant figures. No percent sign is permitted in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of virology and probability theory, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of the Poisson distribution to model viral transduction, a common and accepted approach in the field.\n\nLet $K$ be the random variable representing the number of viral particles that successfully enter a single cell. The problem states that $K$ follows a Poisson distribution with a mean equal to the multiplicity of infection (MOI), denoted by $m$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{m^k e^{-m}}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) representing the number of events (in this case, viral particles entering a cell), and $m$ is the average number of events.\n\nA cell is considered \"transduced\" if it receives at least one viral particle. This corresponds to the event $K \\geq 1$. The fraction of cells that are transduced is equivalent to the probability of this event, $P(K \\geq 1)$.\n\nDirectly calculating this probability would involve summing an infinite series:\n$$P(K \\geq 1) = P(K=1) + P(K=2) + P(K=3) + \\dots = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{m^k e^{-m}}{k!}$$\nA more direct approach is to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is that a cell is *not* transduced. A cell is not transduced if it receives exactly zero viral particles, corresponding to the event $K=0$.\n\nUsing the PMF for the Poisson distribution, we can calculate the probability $P(K=0)$:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{m^0 e^{-m}}{0!}$$\nBy mathematical definition, $m^0 = 1$ for any non-zero $m$, and $0! = 1$. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{1 \\cdot e^{-m}}{1} = e^{-m}$$\nThis is the fraction of cells that remain untransduced.\n\nThe fraction of transduced cells, $F_T$, is the probability that a cell receives one or more particles. This is the complement of receiving zero particles. By the law of total probability:\n$$P(K \\geq 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(K=0)$, we derive the general expression for the fraction of transduced cells as a function of the MOI, $m$:\n$$F_T(m) = 1 - e^{-m}$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires evaluating this fraction for an MOI of $m=3$. Substituting $m=3$ into the derived expression:\n$$F_T(3) = 1 - e^{-3}$$\nNow, we must compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures.\nFirst, we evaluate $e^{-3}$:\n$$e^{-3} \\approx 0.04978706836$$\nThen, we calculate the fraction:\n$$F_T(3) = 1 - 0.04978706836 \\approx 0.95021293163$$\nTo round this value to four significant figures, we identify the first four significant digits, which are $9$, $5$, $0$, and $2$. The fifth significant digit is $1$. Since $1$ is less than $5$, we round down, meaning we keep the fourth digit as is.\nTherefore, the fraction of transduced cells at an MOI of $3$, rounded to four significant figures, is $0.9502$.",

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe rate of change of the protein concentration, $\\frac{dP(t)}{dt}$, is governed by the balance between its rate of production (translation) and its rate of degradation. Based on the provided premises, this relationship can be formulated as a differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Production}) - (\\text{Rate of Degradation})\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given rate expressions:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{tl} m(t) - k_{deg} P(t)\n$$\n\nWe are given that $m(t) = m_{0} \\exp(-k_{m} t)$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k_{tl} m_{0} \\exp(-k_{m} t) - k_{deg} P(t)\n$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form of a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, $y' + p(x)y = q(x)$:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} + k_{deg} P(t) = k_{tl} m_{0} \\exp(-k_{m} t)\n$$\n\nThis type of equation can be solved using the method of an integrating factor, $I(t)$. The integrating factor is defined as $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{deg} \\, dt\\right)$.\n\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp(k_{deg} t)\n$$\n\nMultiplying the entire differential equation by the integrating factor $I(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\exp(k_{deg} t) \\frac{dP}{dt} + k_{deg} \\exp(k_{deg} t) P(t) = k_{tl} m_{0} \\exp(-k_{m} t) \\exp(k_{deg} t)\n$$\n\nThe left-hand side of the equation is now the derivative of the product $P(t) I(t)$ with respect to $t$, by the product rule for differentiation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ P(t) \\exp(k_{deg} t) \\right] = k_{tl} m_{0} \\exp((k_{deg} - k_{m}) t)\n$$\n\nTo find $P(t)$, we integrate both sides of the equation with respect to $t$:\n\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ P(t) \\exp(k_{deg} t) \\right] dt = \\int k_{tl} m_{0} \\exp((k_{deg} - k_{m}) t) dt\n$$\n\n$$\nP(t) \\exp(k_{deg} t) = k_{tl} m_{0} \\int \\exp((k_{deg} - k_{m}) t) dt\n$$\n\nThe integration on the right-hand side is straightforward. The condition $k_{deg} \\neq k_{m}$ is crucial here, as it ensures the denominator of the resulting expression is non-zero.\n\n$$\nP(t) \\exp(k_{deg} t) = \\frac{k_{tl} m_{0}}{k_{deg} - k_{m}} \\exp((k_{deg} - k_{m}) t) + C\n$$\n\nHere, $C$ is the constant of integration. To obtain the expression for $P(t)$, we multiply the entire equation by $\\exp(-k_{deg} t)$:\n\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{tl} m_{0}}{k_{deg} - k_{m}} \\exp((k_{deg} - k_{m}) t) \\exp(-k_{deg} t) + C \\exp(-k_{deg} t)\n$$\n\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{tl} m_{0}}{k_{deg} - k_{m}} \\exp(-k_{m} t) + C \\exp(-k_{deg} t)\n$$\n\nThe value of the integration constant $C$ is determined by applying the initial condition $P(0) = 0$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical epidemiology, well-posed with clear definitions and sufficient data, objective, and free from internal contradictions or implausible assumptions. The task is to derive a standard formula and apply it, which is a standard exercise in biostatistics and epidemiology.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the definitions provided in the problem statement from first principles.\n\nLet $N_v$ be the number of initially susceptible participants in the vaccinated arm of the randomized controlled trial (RCT), and let $I_v$ be the number of these participants who develop symptomatic infection over the specified follow-up period.\nLet $N_p$ be the number of initially susceptible participants in the placebo (unvaccinated) arm, and let $I_p$ be the number of these participants who develop symptomatic infection over the same follow-up period.\n\nAccording to the problem, cumulative incidence ($CI$), also known as risk, is defined as the proportion of initially susceptible individuals who develop the outcome of interest over a fixed period.\nThe cumulative incidence in the vaccinated group, $CI_v$, is therefore:\n$$CI_v = \\frac{I_v}{N_v}$$\nThe cumulative incidence in the placebo group, $CI_p$, is:\n$$CI_p = \\frac{I_p}{N_p}$$\nThe value $CI_p$ represents the baseline risk of infection in the population under study without the intervention (the vaccine). The value $CI_v$ represents the risk of infection when protected by the vaccine.\n\nVaccine efficacy ($VE$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk (cumulative incidence) in the vaccinated group relative to the placebo group.\nThe absolute reduction in risk is the difference between the risk in the placebo group and the risk in the vaccinated group:\n$$\\text{Absolute Risk Reduction} = CI_p - CI_v$$\nTo find the proportional reduction, this absolute reduction is expressed as a fraction of the baseline risk, $CI_p$:\n$$VE = \\frac{CI_p - CI_v}{CI_p}$$\nThis expression fulfills the first part of the task, defining $VE$ as a proportional reduction in risk. The problem further requests this expression in terms of the ratio of cumulative incidences. We can rearrange the equation algebraically:\n$$VE = \\frac{CI_p}{CI_p} - \\frac{CI_v}{CI_p}$$\n$$VE = 1 - \\frac{CI_v}{CI_p}$$\nThe term $\\frac{CI_v}{CI_p}$ is the ratio of the cumulative incidences, which is commonly known as the Relative Risk ($RR$) or Risk Ratio.
