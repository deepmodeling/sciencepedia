The outcome in both arms is assumed to be independently and identically distributed with a common variance $\\sigma^{2}$, which is treated as known for planning purposes.

The derivation will be based on first principles of hypothesis testing, including the definitions of Type I and Type II errors, and the large-sample properties of the sample mean guaranteed by the Central Limit Theorem (CLT).\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1.1: Extract Givens**\n-   Trial Design: Parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n-   Arms: Experimental (Treatment, T) and Control (C).\n-   Outcome: Continuous, with true means $\\mu_{T}$ and $\\mu_{C}$.\n-   Variance: Common, known variance $\\sigma^{2}$ for both arms.\n-   Allocation Ratio: $r:1$ (experimental:control), where $r$ is a fixed constant.\n-   Hypotheses: Null $H_{0}: \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = 0$ versus the two-sided alternative $H_{1}: \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} \\neq 0$.\n-   Significance Level (Type I Error Rate): $\\alpha$.\n-   Power: $1-\\beta$ (Type II Error Rate is $\\beta$).\n-   Effect Size: The trial is designed to detect a true difference of magnitude $|\\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C}| = \\Delta$, where $\\Delta > 0$.\n-   Statistical Framework: Large-sample normal approximation (CLT).\n-   Notation: $z_{p}$ is the $p$-th quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\n**Step 1.2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is a canonical task in biostatistics for the design of clinical trials. It rests on fundamental and universally accepted statistical principles (hypothesis testing, Central Limit Theorem). The setup is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($\\alpha, \\beta, \\sigma, \\Delta, r$) and a clear objective (derive $N$). It is structured to yield a unique analytical solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem statement is formulated using precise, quantitative, and standard statistical terminology. It is free from ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n**Step 1.3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded, and objective problem in biostatistics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\n**2.1: Sample Sizes and Estimators**\nLet $n_{T}$ and $n_{C}$ be the sample sizes for the experimental and control arms, respectively. The total sample size is $N = n_{T} + n_{C}$.\nThe allocation ratio is given as $n_{T}/n_{C} = r$, so $n_{T} = r n_{C}$.\nWe can express $n_{T}$ and $n_{C}$ in terms of the total sample size $N$:\n$$N = r n_{C} + n_{C} = (r+1)n_{C} \\implies n_{C} = \\frac{N}{r+1}$$\n$$n_{T} = r n_{C} = \\frac{rN}{r+1}$$\nThe sample means, $\\bar{X}_{T}$ and $\\bar{X}_{C}$, are the estimators for the true population means, $\\mu_{T}$ and $\\mu_{C}$. The estimator for the difference in means is $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}$.\n\n**2.2: Distribution of the Estimator**\nAccording to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), for large sample sizes, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. Given that the individual observations are independent and identically distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, we have:\n$$\\bar{X}_{T} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{T}, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{T}}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\bar{X}_{C} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{C}, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{C}}\\right)$$\nSince the two trial arms are independent, the difference of the sample means, $\\hat{\\Delta}$, is also approximately normally distributed. The mean of the difference is the difference of the means, and the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C}, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{T}} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_{C}}\\right)$$\nThe variance of the estimator can be simplified:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}) = \\sigma^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{n_{T}} + \\frac{1}{n_{C}}\\right) = \\sigma^2 \\left(\\frac{r+1}{rN} + \\frac{r+1}{N}\\right) = \\sigma^2 \\frac{r+1}{N}\\left(\\frac{1}{r} + 1\\right) = \\sigma^2 \\frac{r+1}{N}\\left(\\frac{1+r}{r}\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2(r+1)^2}{rN}$$\n\n**2.3: Condition for Type I Error (Significance Level)**\nThe null hypothesis is $H_{0}: \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = 0$. Under $H_{0}$, the test statistic $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution:\n$$Z = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta})}} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\nA Type I error occurs if we reject $H_{0}$ when it is true. For a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_{0}$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$. This is equivalent to rejecting if:\n$$|\\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}$$\nThis inequality defines the rejection region for the test.\n\n**2.4: Condition for Power (Type II Error)**\nPower is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_{0}$ when the alternative hypothesis $H_{1}$ is true. We are designing the trial to have power $1-\\beta$ to detect a specific alternative where the true difference is $|\\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C}| = \\Delta$. Without loss of generality, let's consider the case where $\\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = \\Delta > 0$.\nUnder this specific alternative, the estimator $\\hat{\\Delta} = \\bar{X}_{T} - \\bar{X}_{C}$ is distributed as:\n$$\\hat{\\Delta} \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\Delta, \\frac{\\sigma^2(r+1)^2}{rN}\\right)$$\nPower is the probability that $\\hat{\\Delta}$ falls into the rejection region, given this alternative is true.\n$$\\text{Power} = 1-\\beta = P\\left(|\\hat{\\Delta}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}} \\;\\bigg|\\; \\mu_{T} - \\mu_{C} = \\Delta\\right)$$\nThis expands to two terms:\n$$1-\\beta = P\\left(\\hat{\\Delta} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}\\right) + P\\left(\\hat{\\Delta}  -z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}\\right)$$\nFor a well-powered study, the mean of the distribution under the alternative, $\\Delta$, is far from the mean under the null, $0$. The second term corresponds to observing a large negative difference when the true difference is large and positive, which is an event with negligible probability. Therefore, we can accurately approximate the power using only the first term:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(\\hat{\\Delta} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}\\right)$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the variable $\\hat{\\Delta}$ using its distribution under the alternative hypothesis:\n$$Z' = \\frac{\\hat{\\Delta} - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$\nRewriting the inequality in terms of $Z'$:\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(Z' > \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}} - \\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}}\\right)$$\n$$1-\\beta \\approx P\\left(Z' > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}}\\right)$$\nFor a standard normal variable $Z'$, the statement $P(Z' > k) = 1-\\beta$ implies that $k$ is the $\\beta$-th quantile, $z_{\\beta}$. By the symmetry of the normal distribution, $z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$. Thus, we must have:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}} = -z_{1-\\beta}$$\n\n**2.5: Solving for the Total Sample Size N**\nWe now rearrange the equation to solve for $N$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{(r+1)^2}{rN}}} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta \\sqrt{rN}}{\\sigma(r+1)} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta}$$\nIsolating $\\sqrt{N}$:\n$$\\sqrt{N} = \\frac{\\sigma(r+1)}{\\Delta\\sqrt{r}} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})$$\nSquaring both sides gives the final expression for the minimum total sample size $N$:\n$$N = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma(r+1)}{\\Delta\\sqrt{r}}\\right)^2 (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2$$\n$$N = \\frac{\\sigma^2 (r+1)^2}{r \\Delta^2} (z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2$$\nThis formula provides the minimum total number of participants required to achieve a power of $1-\\beta$ for detecting a true mean difference of $\\Delta$ with a two-sided significance level of $\\alpha$, given a common variance $\\sigma^2$ and an allocation ratio of $r:1$.",

A unique, stable solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The definitions and constraints are consistent with one another. For example, the $1:1$ allocation ratio is consistent with having $2$ T and $2$ C assignments in a block of size $4$.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective question in the field of biostatistics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nLet the set of strata be $\\mathcal{S} = \\{\\text{MM, MS, FM, FS}\\}$. For each stratum $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$, let $N_s$ be the total number of participants, $T_s$ be the number allocated to the new therapy, and $C_s$ be the number allocated to standard care. The imbalance within stratum $s$ is $D_s = T_s - C_s$. The total number of participants in stratum $s$ is fixed, so $T_s + C_s = N_s$.\n\nThe overall allocation imbalance is the sum of the imbalances across all strata:\n$$D = T_{\\mathrm{total}} - C_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\left(\\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} T_s\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} C_s\\right) = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} (T_s - C_s) = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} D_s$$\n\nWe are asked to find $\\mathbb{E}[D^2]$. Substituting the expression for $D$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} D_s\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} D_s^2 + \\sum_{s \\neq s'} D_s D_{s'}\\right]$$\nBy linearity of expectation, this becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D^2] = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mathbb{E}[D_s^2] + \\sum_{s \\neq s'} \\mathbb{E}[D_s D_{s'}]$$\nThe problem states that randomization is independent across strata. Therefore, for any two distinct strata $s$ and $s'$, the random variables $D_s$ and $D_{s'}$ are independent. This implies $\\mathbb{E}[D_s D_{s'}] = \\mathbb{E}[D_s]\\mathbb{E}[D_{s'}]$.\n\nLet us analyze the imbalance $D_s$ for a single stratum $s$ with $N_s$ participants and block size $b=4$. The number of complete blocks is $k_s = \\lfloor N_s / b \\rfloor$. The number of participants in the final, possibly incomplete, block is $r_s = N_s \\pmod b$. Thus, $N_s = k_s b + r_s$.\n\nWithin the $k_s$ complete blocks, the allocation is perfectly balanced due to the $1:1$ ratio within each block. The number of participants allocated to T is $k_s \\times (b/2)$ and to C is $k_s \\times (b/2)$. The imbalance from these complete blocks is $0$. Any imbalance in the stratum arises solely from the final block of size $r_s$.\n\nLet $T_{s, \\text{final}}$ and $C_{s, \\text{final}}$ be the number of T and C allocations in this final block. We have $T_{s, \\text{final}} + C_{s, \\text{final}} = r_s$. The total number of T and C allocations in the stratum are:\n$$T_s = k_s \\frac{b}{2} + T_{s, \\text{final}}$$\n$$C_s = k_s \\frac{b}{2} + C_{s, \\text{final}}$$\nThe imbalance for stratum $s$ is:\n$$D_s = T_s - C_s = T_{s, \\text{final}} - C_{s, \\text{final}}$$\nSubstituting $C_{s, \\text{final}} = r_s - T_{s, \\text{final}}$, we get:\n$$D_s = T_{s, \\text{final}} - (r_s - T_{s, \\text{final}}) = 2T_{s, \\text{final}} - r_s$$\nThe final block of size $r_s$ consists of the first $r_s$ assignments from a random permutation of a full block containing $b/2=2$ T's and $b/2=2$ C's. The random variable $T_{s, \\text{final}}$ represents the number of T's in a random sample of size $r_s$ drawn without replacement from a population of size $b=4$ containing $b/2=2$ T's. This follows a hypergeometric distribution with parameters (population size $N=4$, number of successes in population $K=2$, sample size $n=r_s$).\n\nThe expectation of a hypergeometric random variable is $\\mathbb{E}[T_{s, \\text{final}}] = r_s \\frac{K}{N} = r_s \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{r_s}{2}$.\nThe expectation of the stratum imbalance $D_s$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_s] = \\mathbb{E}[2T_{s, \\text{final}} - r_s] = 2\\mathbb{E}[T_{s, \\text{final}}] - r_s = 2\\left(\\frac{r_s}{2}\\right) - r_s = 0$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[D_s]=0$ for all strata, the cross-product terms in the expansion of $\\mathbb{E}[D^2]$ are all zero: $\\mathbb{E}[D_s D_{s'}] = \\mathbb{E}[D_s]\\mathbb{E}[D_{s'}] = 0 \\times 0 = 0$ for $s \\neq s'$.\nThe expression for $\\mathbb{E}[D^2]$ simplifies to:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D^2] = \\sum_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\mathbb{E}[D_s^2]$$\nAlso, since $\\mathbb{E}[D_s]=0$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[D_s^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(D_s) + (\\mathbb{E}[D_s])^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(D_s)$.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D_s) = \\mathrm{Var}(2T_{s, \\text{final}} - r_s) = \\mathrm{Var}(2T_{s, \\text{final}}) = 4\\mathrm{Var}(T_{s, \\text{final}})$$\nThe variance of a hypergeometric random variable is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(T_{s, \\text{final}}) = r_s \\frac{K}{N}\\left(1-\\frac{K}{N}\\right)\\frac{N-r_s}{N-1}$.\nSubstituting $N=b=4$ and $K=b/2=2$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(T_{s, \\text{final}}) = r_s \\frac{2}{4}\\left(1-\\frac{2}{4}\\right)\\frac{4-r_s}{4-1} = r_s \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\frac{4-r_s}{3} = \\frac{r_s(4-r_s)}{12}$$\nSo, the expected squared imbalance for a single stratum is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[D_s^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(D_s) = 4 \\times \\frac{r_s(4-r_s)}{12} = \\frac{r_s(4-r_s)}{3}$$\nNow we compute this value for each of the four strata.\n\n1.  **Stratum MM (Male-Mild):**\n    $N_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 45$. Block size $b=4$.\n    $r_{\\mathrm{MM}} = 45 \\pmod 4 = 1$.\n    $\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\mathrm{MM}}^2] = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{MM}}(4-r_{\\mathrm{MM}})}{3} = \\frac{1(4-1)}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$.\n\n2.  **Stratum MS (Male-Severe):**\n    $N_{\\mathrm{MS}} = 27$. Block size $b=4$.\n    $r_{\\mathrm{MS}} = 27 \\pmod 4 = 3$.\n    $\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\mathrm{MS}}^2] = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{MS}}(4-r_{\\mathrm{MS}})}{3} = \\frac{3(4-3)}{3} = \\frac{3}{3} = 1$.\n\n3.  **Stratum FM (Female-Mild):**\n    $N_{\\mathrm{FM}} = 38$. Block size $b=4$.\n    $r_{\\mathrm{FM}} = 38 \\pmod 4 = 2$.\n    $\\mathbb{E}[D_{\\mathrm{FM}}^2] = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{FM}}(4-r_{\\mathrm{FM}})}{3} = \\frac{2(4-2)}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$.\n\n4.  **Stratum FS (Female-Severe):**\n    $N_{\\mathrm{FS}} = 18$.

This constant $K$ is the same for all scenarios (ideal, ITT, PP) since we preserve the error rates.\n\n**1. The Ideal Case (Baseline)**\nIn an ideal trial with perfect adherence and no loss to follow-up, we randomize $n_0$ subjects per arm.\n- **Effect Size**: The intervention causes a shift of $\\Delta$. The true mean difference between arms is $\\delta_{\\text{ideal}} = \\Delta$.\n- **Variance of Estimator**: The estimator for the difference in means is $\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ideal}} = \\bar{Y}_I - \\bar{Y}_C$. Its variance is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\text{ideal}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_0} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_0} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n_0}$.\n- **Sample Size Formula**: From the core principle, we can establish the baseline relationship:\n$$n_0 = K \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\Delta^2}$$\n\n**2. Intention-To-Treat (ITT) Analysis**\nLet $n_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$ be the number of subjects randomized per arm.\n- **Effective Sample Size**: Due to loss to follow-up at rate $L$, only a fraction $1-L$ of subjects provide data. The effective sample size per arm for the analysis is $n'_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = n_{\\mathrm{ITT}}(1-L)$.\n- **ITT Effect Size**: The ITT analysis compares outcomes by original randomized assignment.\n    - Expected mean in the intervention arm: A fraction $(1-p)$ receives treatment (mean $\\mu+\\Delta$) and a fraction $p$ does not (mean $\\mu$). The expectation is $\\mu_{I, \\text{ITT}} = (1-p)(\\mu+\\Delta) + p(\\mu) = \\mu + (1-p)\\Delta$.\n    - Expected mean in the control arm: A fraction $(1-p)$ does not receive treatment (mean $\\mu$) and a fraction $p$ does (contamination, mean $\\mu+\\Delta$). The expectation is $\\mu_{C, \\text{ITT}} = (1-p)\\mu + p(\\mu+\\Delta) = \\mu + p\\Delta$.\n    - The ITT effect is the difference in these expectations: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = \\mu_{I, \\text{ITT}} - \\mu_{C, \\text{ITT}} = (\\mu + (1-p)\\Delta) - (\\mu + p\\Delta) = \\Delta(1-2p)$.\n- **Variance of ITT Estimator**: The variance is based on the effective sample size $n'_{\\mathrm{ITT}}$. The per-subject outcome variance is still $\\sigma^2$.\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{ITT}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n'_{\\mathrm{ITT}}} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n'_{\\mathrm{ITT}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n_{\\mathrm{ITT}}(1-L)}$$\n- **Required Sample Size for ITT**: We apply the core principle again:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = K \\frac{2\\sigma^2 / (1-L)}{(\\delta_{\\mathrm{ITT}})^2} = K \\frac{2\\sigma^2 / (1-L)}{(\\Delta(1-2p))^2} = \\left(K \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\Delta^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-2p)^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_0$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = n_0 \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-2p)^2}$$\nThe inflation factor is $F_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{ITT}}}{n_0} = \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-2p)^2}$.\n\n**3. Per-Protocol (PP) Analysis**\nLet $n_{\\mathrm{PP}}$ be the number of subjects randomized per arm. The PP analysis includes only subjects who adhered and were not lost to follow-up.\n- **Effective Sample Size**: In each arm, a fraction $(1-p)$ are adherers, and of these, a fraction $(1-L)$ provide data. The effective sample size per arm is $n'_{\\mathrm{PP}} = n_{\\mathrm{PP}}(1-p)(1-L)$.\n- **PP Effect Size**: The PP analysis compares outcomes only among adherers.\n    - Adherers in the intervention arm receive the intervention (mean $\\mu+\\Delta$).\n    - Adherers in the control arm do not receive the intervention (mean $\\mu$).\n    - The PP effect is the true treatment effect: $\\delta_{\\mathrm{PP}} = (\\mu+\\Delta) - \\mu = \\Delta$.\n- **Variance of PP Estimator**: The variance is based on the effective PP sample size $n'_{\\mathrm{PP}}$.\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{PP}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n'_{\\mathrm{PP}}} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n'_{\\mathrm{PP}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n_{\\mathrm{PP}}(1-p)(1-L)}$$\n- **Required Sample Size for PP**:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{PP}} = K \\frac{2\\sigma^2 / ((1-p)(1-L))}{(\\delta_{\\mathrm{PP}})^2} = K \\frac{2\\sigma^2 / ((1-p)(1-L))}{\\Delta^2} = \\left(K \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{\\Delta^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{(1-p)(1-L)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $n_0$:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{PP}} = n_0 \\frac{1}{(1-p)(1-L)}$$\nThe inflation factor is $F_{\\mathrm{PP}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{PP}}}{n_0} = \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-p)}$.\n\nThe final derived inflation factors are $F_{\\mathrm{ITT}} = \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-2p)^2}$ and $F_{\\mathrm{PP}} = \\frac{1}{(1-L)(1-p)}$.",
