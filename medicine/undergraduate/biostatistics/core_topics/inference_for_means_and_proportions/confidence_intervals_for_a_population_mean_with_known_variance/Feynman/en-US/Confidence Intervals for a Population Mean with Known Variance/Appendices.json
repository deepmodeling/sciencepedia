            "problem": "A clinical research team plans a cross-sectional study to estimate the population mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after a new dietary intervention. Prior meta-analytic data indicate that the population standard deviation of the reduction can be treated as known and equal to $\\sigma = 18$ mg/dL for planning purposes. The team desires a two-sided confidence interval (CI) with confidence level $0.95$ for the mean reduction whose half-width does not exceed $m = 3$ mg/dL.\n\nStarting from the sampling distribution of the sample mean under a normal model with known variance and the definition of a two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval, derive the inequality on the sample size $n$ that guarantees the CI half-width does not exceed $m$, and solve algebraically for the minimum $n$ consistent with that constraint. Then evaluate the resulting expression numerically for $\\alpha = 0.05$, $\\sigma = 18$ mg/dL, and $m = 3$ mg/dL. Carry any standard normal quantile values to at least four significant figures; you may use $z_{0.975} = 1.960$. Report the minimum integer sample size $n$ required. Finally, briefly discuss why $n$ must be rounded in a particular direction and the implications for planning (for example, allowing for attrition or uncertainty in $\\sigma$).\n\nYour final answer must be a single integer equal to the minimum $n$ that satisfies the requirement. Do not include units in your final answer. If you perform any intermediate rounding, use at least four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the sample size formula starting from the definition of a confidence interval. Let $\\bar{X}$ be the sample mean from a random sample of size $n$ from a population with unknown mean $\\mu$ and known standard deviation $\\sigma$. Assuming a normal model for the underlying data, or by appeal to the Central Limit Theorem for a sufficiently large $n$, the sampling distribution of the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ is normal with mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$. This is denoted as $\\bar{X} \\sim N(\\mu, \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n})$.\n\nThe standardized variable, $Z = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}$, follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n\nA two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for the population mean $\\mu$ is constructed from the pivotal quantity $Z$. We find a value $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ such that the area under the standard normal curve between $-z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ and $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is $1-\\alpha$. This is expressed as the probability statement:\n$$P(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} < Z < z_{1-\\alpha/2}) = 1-\\alpha$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Z$:\n$$P\\left(-z_{1-\\alpha/2} < \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}} < z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right) = 1-\\alpha$$\nTo derive the confidence interval for $\\mu$, we perform algebraic rearrangement to isolate $\\mu$ in the center of the inequality. First, multiply all parts by the standard error, $\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$-z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} < \\bar{X} - \\mu < z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nNext, subtract the sample mean $\\bar{X}$ from all parts:\n$$-\\bar{X} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} < -\\mu < -\\bar{X} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nFinally, multiply all parts by $-1$, which reverses the direction of the inequalities:\n$$\\bar{X} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\mu > \\bar{X} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nRewriting in the standard order, the $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\mu$ is:\n$$\\left( \\bar{X} - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\bar{X} + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\right)$$\nThe interval can be expressed as $\\bar{X} \\pm W$, where $W$ is the half-width (also known as the margin of error). From the expression above, the half-width $W$ is:\n$$W = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\nThe problem requires that this half-width does not exceed a specified maximum value $m$. This condition gives us the following inequality:\n$$z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}} \\le m$$\nTo find the minimum sample size $n$ that satisfies this constraint, we solve this inequality for $n$.\nFirst, we isolate $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$\\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma}{m} \\le \\sqrt{n}$$\nSquaring both sides preserves the inequality:\n$$\\left( \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma}{m} \\right)^2 \\le n$$\nThis is the general inequality for the minimum sample size $n$. To find the specific required sample size, we substitute the given values.\nThe confidence level is $0.95$, so $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, which gives $\\alpha = 0.05$. The quantile needed is $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1 - 0.05/2} = z_{0.975}$. The problem states to use the value $z_{0.975} = 1.960$.\nThe other given values are the population standard deviation, $\\sigma = 18$ mg/dL, and the maximum desired half-width, $m = 3$ mg/dL.\nSubstituting these into the inequality:\n$$n \\ge \\left( \\frac{1.960 \\times 18}{3} \\right)^2$$\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$n \\ge \\left( 1.960 \\times 6 \\right)^2$$\n$$n \\ge (11.76)^2$$\n$$n \\ge 138.3076$$\nSince the sample size $n$ must be an integer, we must choose the smallest integer that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $138.3076$ is $139$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for a discussion on rounding and planning implications.\nThe sample size $n$ must be rounded up to the next whole number. The inequality $n \\ge 138.3076$ dictates that any sample size less than this value, including the integer $n=138$, will fail to meet the specified precision. A sample size of $n=138$ would result in a confidence interval half-width of $1.960 \\times \\frac{18}{\\sqrt{138}} \\approx 3.0066$ mg/dL, which exceeds the required maximum of $3$ mg/dL. Therefore, we must always round up to ensure the study's objective for precision is met.\n\nFor planning purposes, this calculated value, $n=139$, represents the minimum number of analysable subjects required at the end of the study. Clinical studies are invariably subject to participant attrition (e.g., subjects dropping out, failing to adhere to the protocol, or having missing data). To account for this, researchers must enroll a larger number of subjects than the calculated minimum. For instance, if an attrition rate of $10\\%$ is anticipated, the target enrollment would be $n_{\\text{enroll}} = \\frac{139}{1-0.10} \\approx 154.4$, meaning at least $155$ subjects should be enrolled. Additionally, the calculation depends on the estimate of the population standard deviation $\\sigma = 18$ mg/dL, which is taken from prior data and may not be exact for the study's population. If the true standard deviation is larger than $18$, the study will be underpowered (i.e., the confidence interval will be wider than desired) with $n=139$. Prudent study planning might involve using a slightly more conservative (larger) estimate for $\\sigma$ to build a buffer against this uncertainty.\nThe minimum integer sample size required is $139$.",
