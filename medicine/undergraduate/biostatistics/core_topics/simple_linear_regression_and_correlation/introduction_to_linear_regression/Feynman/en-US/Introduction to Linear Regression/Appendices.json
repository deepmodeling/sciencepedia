            "introduction": "Before drawing conclusions from a linear regression model, we must first assess how well the model fits the data. The coefficient of determination, or $R^2$, is one of the most fundamental measures for this purpose. This practice will help you calculate and interpret $R^2$ as the proportion of total variability in the outcome that is explained by the regression model, providing a crucial first look at your model's explanatory power .",

            "problem": "An agricultural scientist is investigating the relationship between the amount of a specific nutrient supplement (in grams) added to the soil and the subsequent height of a newly developed plant species (in centimeters). A simple linear regression model is fitted to the collected data. To assess the goodness-of-fit of the model, an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) is performed. The analysis yields a Regression Sum of Squares (SSR) of 90.0 cm$^2$ and a Total Sum of Squares (SST) of 120.0 cm$^2$.\n\nCalculate the coefficient of determination, denoted as $R^2$, for this linear regression model. Express your answer as a decimal value.",
            "solution": "The coefficient of determination for a linear regression is defined by the proportion of total variability explained by the regression:\n$$\nR^{2}=\\frac{\\text{SSR}}{\\text{SST}}.\n$$\nGiven $\\text{SSR}=90.0$ and $\\text{SST}=120.0$, substitute into the formula:\n$$\nR^{2}=\\frac{90.0}{120.0}=\\frac{9}{12}=\\frac{3}{4}=0.75.\n$$\nThus, the coefficient of determination is $0.75$.",

            "introduction": "In many scientific contexts, the effect of one variable is not constant but depends on the level of another. Linear regression can model such complex relationships using interaction terms. This exercise  challenges you to move beyond simple additive effects and explore how including an interaction term fundamentally changes the interpretation of the main coefficients, a critical skill for building more nuanced and realistic statistical models.",

            "problem": "A clinical trial investigates how a lipid-lowering medication affects low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Let the outcome be the fasting LDL-C level, denoted by $Y$. Two predictors are considered: a binary indicator $X_{1}$ for medication assignment ($X_{1}=1$ if patient received the medication, $X_{1}=0$ otherwise) and age in years, $X_{2}$. To allow the effect of medication to vary with age, an interaction term between $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ is included. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimate of the conditional mean function is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_{1}, X_{2}] = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} X_{1} + \\beta_{2} X_{2} + \\beta_{3} X_{1} X_{2},\n$$\nwith fitted coefficients $\\beta_{0} = 160$, $\\beta_{1} = -30$, $\\beta_{2} = 0.6$, and $\\beta_{3} = 0.2$.\n\nStarting from the definition of the conditional mean in the linear model and the meaning of an interaction term, explain how the inclusion of the product $X_{1} X_{2}$ changes the interpretation of the main-effect coefficients $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ relative to a model that omits the interaction term. Then, using the fitted coefficients above, compute the marginal effect of $X_{1}$ on the expected LDL-C at $X_{2} = 60$, defined as the change in $\\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_{1}, X_{2}]$ when $X_{1}$ increases by one unit while holding $X_{2}$ fixed. Express your numerical answer in mg/dL and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "To understand how the interaction term $X_{1}X_{2}$ alters the interpretation of the main-effect coefficients $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$, we first consider a model without this term (an additive model). In an additive model, the coefficient for $X_1$ is its main effect, representing the constant difference in mean $Y$ between the two groups, regardless of $X_2$.\n\nIn the model with the interaction term, the effect of each predictor depends on the level of the other. The effect of the medication ($X_1$) on expected LDL-C is the difference in the conditional expectation when $X_1$ changes from 0 to 1:\n$$\n\\text{Effect of } X_1 = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_1=1, X_2] - \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_1=0, X_2]\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Effect of } X_1 = (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\beta_3 X_2) - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_2 X_2) = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 X_2\n$$\nThe coefficient $\\beta_1$ is no longer the overall main effect. Instead, it represents the effect of the medication only when $X_2=0$.\n\nSimilarly, the effect of a one-unit increase in age ($X_2$) is the partial derivative of the conditional mean function with respect to $X_2$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_2} \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mid X_1, X_2] = \\beta_2 + \\beta_3 X_1\n$$\nThis effect depends on the medication status, $X_1$. The coefficient $\\beta_2$ now represents the effect of a one-year increase in age on LDL-C for the control group ($X_1=0$) only.\n\nIn summary, the interaction term changes the interpretation of $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ from *main* effects to *conditional* effects, specific to the case where the other variable in the interaction is zero.\n\nTo compute the marginal effect of $X_1$ at age $X_2 = 60$, we use the derived formula for the effect of $X_1$:\n$$\n\\text{Marginal Effect of } X_1 = \\beta_1 + \\beta_3 X_2\n$$\nSubstituting the fitted coefficients ($\\beta_1 = -30$, $\\beta_3 = 0.2$) and age ($X_2 = 60$):\n$$\n\\text{Marginal Effect at } X_2=60 = -30 + (0.2)(60) = -30 + 12 = -18\n$$\nFor a $60$-year-old patient, receiving the medication is associated with an average decrease of $18$ mg/dL in LDL-C. Rounding to four significant figures, the answer is $-18.00$.",

            "introduction": "Real-world data is often imperfect and may contain unusual observations that can disproportionately influence our regression results. The key is to distinguish between valid but extreme data points and actual errors. This practice  guides you through a realistic scenario, teaching you to use diagnostic statistics like leverage and Cook's distance not as automatic rules for exclusion, but as tools that prompt a principled investigation combining statistical evidence with scientific plausibility.",

            "problem": "A biostatistics team models fasting plasma glucose, denoted by $Y$ (in milligrams per deciliter), as a linear function of age, denoted by $X$ (in years), among non-diabetic adults in a community study with sample size $n=120$. The team fits the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) simple linear regression model $Y_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_i + \\varepsilon_i$ and uses standard diagnostics to assess unusual or influential observations. Two observations raise concerns:\n\n1. Subject A has $X=92$ and $Y=95$. The diagnostics for Subject A show leverage $h_{ii}=0.30$, studentized residual $r_i=0.4$, and Cook’s distance $D_i=0.08$. The subject’s age of $92$ years is within the study’s intended population, and repeat checks confirm the measurement procedures were followed correctly. The fitted model’s point prediction at $X=92$ is $98$, which is close to the observed $Y$.\n\n2. Subject B has $X=34$ and $Y=540$. The diagnostics for Subject B show leverage $h_{ii}=0.10$, studentized residual $r_i=5.2$, and Cook’s distance $D_i=1.1$. For non-diabetic fasting measurements, laboratory reference materials indicate that values above $400$ milligrams per deciliter are physiologically implausible without acute pathology inconsistent with the study’s inclusion criteria. A laboratory audit notes that the sample was severely hemolyzed and a calibration flag was triggered on the analyzer for this specimen.\n\nBased on first principles of linear regression and a scientifically grounded approach to outlier assessment, which option most appropriately distinguishes an outlier in $X$ from an outlier in $Y \\mid X$ and sets a principled course of action for possible exclusion?\n\nA. Exclude both subjects immediately because they are influential, as indicated by the diagnostics.\n\nB. Retain Subject A after confirming measurement validity and scientific plausibility; for Subject B, investigate data provenance, consider physiological plausibility and documented measurement error, and if a measurement error is substantiated or the value is implausible for the target population, exclude Subject B; otherwise, conduct sensitivity analyses by refitting with and without Subject B and report the impact.\n\nC. Exclude any observation with high leverage $h_{ii}$ regardless of its residual or plausibility, because high leverage always biases the slope estimate.\n\nD. Keep both observations and collect more data until their influence becomes negligible; exclusion is never justified because it can introduce bias.",
            "solution": "The core principle in handling unusual observations is that statistical diagnostics are tools for identification, not automatic arbiters for exclusion. The decision to remove a data point must be justified by evidence of data invalidity.\n\n**Analysis of Subject A:**\nThis subject has high leverage ($h_{ii}=0.30$), indicating their age ($X=92$) is an outlier in the predictor space. However, their studentized residual is small ($r_i=0.4$), meaning the glucose value ($Y=95$) is very close to the model's prediction. The context confirms the age is plausible and the measurement is valid. This is a \"good\" high-leverage point that reinforces the model's trend and should be retained. There is no principled reason for exclusion.\n\n**Analysis of Subject B:**\nThis subject has an extremely large studentized residual ($r_i=5.2$), indicating their glucose value ($Y=540$) is a major outlier in the response space, given their age ($X=34$). This results in a high Cook's distance ($D_i=1.1$), making the point highly influential. Critically, the external information confirms this is an invalid data point: the value is physiologically implausible for the study population, and a lab audit found a \"severely hemolyzed\" sample and an instrument flag. This is a documented measurement error. Including known-to-be-false data will bias the model. Therefore, this point should be excluded.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n- Option A is incorrect because influence alone is not grounds for exclusion; Subject A is a valid point.\n- Option C is incorrect because high leverage points are not inherently bad; they can be beneficial if they conform to the model trend.\n- Option D is incorrect because it is necessary to exclude data points that are confirmed to be measurement errors to avoid corrupting the analysis.\n- Option B correctly describes the principled approach: retain the valid but influential point (Subject A), and investigate the problematic point (Subject B), leading to its exclusion based on substantiated measurement error and implausibility. This option also correctly suggests sensitivity analysis as the alternative if the investigation were inconclusive.\n\nTherefore, Option B represents the most appropriate and scientifically rigorous course of action.",
