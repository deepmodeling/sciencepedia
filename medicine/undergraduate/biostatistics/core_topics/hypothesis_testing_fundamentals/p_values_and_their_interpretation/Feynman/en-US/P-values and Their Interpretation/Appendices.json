This exercise grounds the concept of a p-value in a practical quality control scenario within pharmaceutical manufacturing . By working through the calculation of a $Z$-statistic and its corresponding two-sided p-value, you will build a core skill for hypothesis testing when the population variance is known, a common starting point for learning statistical inference.",

            "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is manufacturing a liquid medication where the precise dosage is critical for patient safety. The automated filling machines are calibrated to dispense a mean volume of $\\mu_0 = 75.0$ mL per vial. The filling process is known to have a stable population standard deviation of $\\sigma = 1.5$ mL. As part of a routine quality control check, a random sample of $n = 36$ vials is selected from the production line. The average volume of medication in this sample is measured to be $\\bar{x} = 75.6$ mL.\n\nYour task is to conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate whether the filling process is still centered at the target volume. Specifically, calculate the p-value associated with a test where the alternative hypothesis is that the true mean fill volume differs from $75.0$ mL.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.",

            "introduction": "Classical statistical tests often rely on assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data, such as normality, which may not always hold true. This practice introduces a powerful, assumption-free computational method: the permutation test . By understanding how to estimate a p-value by simulating the null hypothesis through data shuffling, you will learn a robust and intuitive approach to assess significance, especially valuable in modern biostatistics with small sample sizes or non-standard data.",

            "problem": "An e-commerce company is conducting an A/B test to determine if a new checkout page design (Design B) is faster than their current design (Design A). A small group of volunteer users is randomly assigned to one of the two designs. The time, in seconds, for each user to complete a purchase is recorded.\n\nThe recorded times for the 4 users assigned to Design A are: {110, 125, 130, 150}.\nThe recorded times for the 5 users assigned to Design B are: {95, 100, 105, 115, 140}.\n\nThe company is interested in the difference between the median completion times, defined as $D = \\text{Median}(A) - \\text{Median}(B)$. A positive value of $D$ would suggest that Design A is slower than Design B.\n\nTo assess the statistical significance of the observed result without making assumptions about the underlying distribution of checkout times, a computational analysis was performed. All 9 recorded times were pooled together. From this combined set, every possible unique group of 4 measurements was designated as a \"simulated Group A,\" with the remaining 5 measurements forming the corresponding \"simulated Group B,\" resulting in a total of 126 distinct re-assignments. For each of these 126 re-assignments, the difference in medians was calculated. The analysis revealed that 10 of these simulated differences were greater than or equal to the difference originally observed in the experiment.\n\nBased on the results of this computational analysis, what is the estimated p-value for testing whether the new design significantly reduces the median checkout time? Express your answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.",

The number of distinct reassignments is\n$$\nN = \\binom{9}{4} = 126.\n$$\n\nFor each reassignment, the difference in medians is computed in the same way as $D$.

            "introduction": "While a small p-value signals that your data is surprising under the null hypothesis, what does an extremely *large* p-value signify?

It teaches the crucial skill of critical interpretation, revealing how an unusually 'perfect' fit between data and theory can be a red flag that warrants deeper scrutiny of the experimental process itself.",

            "problem": "An agricultural scientist is investigating a new variety of pea plant, which, according to Mendelian genetics, is expected to produce round yellow, round green, wrinkled yellow, and wrinkled green peas in a phenotypic ratio of 9:3:3:1. To test this hypothesis, the scientist grows a large number of these plants and records the phenotypes of 1600 observed peas. The results are exceptionally close to the theoretical expectation: 901 round yellow, 299 round green, 301 wrinkled yellow, and 99 wrinkled green.\n\nA chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is performed on this data to compare the observed frequencies with the frequencies expected under the 9:3:3:1 hypothesis.

The null hypothesis is definitively proven to be true; the peas follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio exactly.\n\nB. The data fits the null hypothesis so perfectly that it raises suspicions about the integrity of the data collection or potential unconscious bias in recording the results.\n\nC. There is strong evidence that the peas do not follow the 9:3:3:1 ratio.\n\nD. There is a 99.8% probability that the null hypothesis (the 9:3:3:1 ratio) is correct.\n\nE. The experiment lacks the statistical power to detect any meaningful deviation from the hypothesized ratio.",

The p-value is defined as\n$$\np=\\Pr\\!\\left(\\chi^{2}_{3}\\ge \\chi^{2}_{\\text{obs}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich, for the extremely small observed $\\chi^{2}_{\\text{obs}}=\\frac{4}{225}$, is very close to $1$. The problem states the computed p-value is $0.998$, which is consistent with the above calculation.\n\nStatistical interpretation:\n- A very large p-value indicates that the data are not inconsistent with the null; it does not prove the null hypothesis is exactly true. Therefore, option A is incorrect.\n- Interpreting the p-value as the probability the null is correct (option D) is a common but incorrect frequentist interpretation.\n- A large p-value does not provide evidence against the null, so option C is incorrect.\n- With $n=1600$, the test has high power to detect meaningful deviations; thus option E is not supported by the circumstances.\n- An exceptionally high p-value, arising from an unusually small chi-squared statistic (i.e., underdispersion relative to what randomness would typically produce), can suggest that the fit is suspiciously good. Historically, such “too good to be true” agreement has been noted as a possible sign of unconscious selection or bias in data recording. Hence, the most astute interpretation is option B.",
