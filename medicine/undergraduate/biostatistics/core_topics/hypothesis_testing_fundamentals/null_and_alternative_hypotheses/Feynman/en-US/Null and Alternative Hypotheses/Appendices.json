            "problem": "An entomologist is studying the foraging behavior of a particular species of honeybee. The number of flowers a bee visits until it successfully finds one with nectar can be modeled by a random variable $X$ following a geometric distribution with a parameter $p$, where $p$ is the probability of success (finding nectar) at any single flower.\n\nFor years, it was assumed that the bees' environment provided a stable nectar probability of $p=0.3$. However, due to recent changes in local flora, the entomologist suspects that the foraging has become more difficult, meaning the success probability has decreased. The entomologist decides to conduct a statistical test to determine if there is significant evidence for this suspicion.\n\nYour task is to formulate the null hypothesis ($H_0$) and the alternative hypothesis ($H_A$) for testing the claim that the success probability $p$ is now less than 0.3. Which of the following represents the correct pair of hypotheses?\n\nA. $H_0: p = 0.3$ vs. $H_A: p \\ne 0.3$\n\nB. $H_0: p = 0.3$ vs. $H_A: p  0.3$\n\nC. $H_0: p  0.3$ vs. $H_A: p = 0.3$\n\nD. $H_0: \\hat{p} = 0.3$ vs. $H_A: \\hat{p}  0.3$\n\nE. $H_0: p = 0.3$ vs. $H_A: p > 0.3$",
            "solution": "Let $p$ denote the probability that a bee finds nectar at a single flower. Historically, the baseline is $p=0.3$. The entomologist suspects the environment has made foraging more difficult, which implies a decrease in success probability, i.e., the research claim is $p0.3$.\n\nIn hypothesis testing for a parameter $p$, the null hypothesis $H_{0}$ is formulated to represent the status quo or baseline value and includes equality. Therefore, we set $H_{0}: p=0.3$. The alternative hypothesis $H_{A}$ encodes the directional research claim; here it is left-tailed: $H_{A}: p0.3$.\n\nChecking the options:\n- Option A uses a two-sided alternative $p \\ne 0.3$, which does not match the directional claim $p0.3$.\n- Option B sets $H_{0}: p=0.3$ and $H_{A}: p0.3$, which matches the research claim and proper hypothesis structure.\n- Option C reverses the roles and incorrectly places $p0.3$ in $H_{0}$; the null should contain the equality case.\n- Option D improperly states hypotheses in terms of the sample statistic $\\hat{p}$ rather than the population parameter $p$.\n- Option E tests for $p>0.3$, the opposite of the claim.\n\nTherefore, the correct pair is $H_{0}: p=0.3$ versus $H_{A}: p0.3$, which is Option B.",

            "problem": "An aerospace engineering team is developing a new type of radioisotope thermoelectric generator for a long-duration deep-space mission. The design specification states that the mean time to failure (MTTF) of these generators must be greater than 5000 hours. To verify this, the team conducts a life-test on a random sample of $n=10$ prototype generators. The lifetimes of these generators are assumed to be independent and to follow an exponential distribution. The test is run until all 10 generators fail, and the sum of their lifetimes is recorded as 60,000 hours.\n\nThe team decides to perform a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis that the true MTTF is exactly 5000 hours, against the alternative hypothesis that it is greater than 5000 hours.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to perform a hypothesis test for the mean of an exponential distribution. Let the random variable $X$ represent the lifetime of a generator. We are given that $X$ follows an exponential distribution. The probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution can be parameterized by its mean $\\mu$, or by its rate parameter $\\lambda = 1/\\mu$. The PDF in terms of $\\mu$ is $f(x; \\mu) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\frac{x}{\\mu})$ for $x \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we state the null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the mean time to failure (MTTF), $\\mu$.\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that the MTTF is exactly 5000 hours.\n$$H_0: \\mu = 5000$$\nThe alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is that the MTTF is greater than 5000 hours.\n$$H_a: \\mu > 5000$$\n\nFor an exponential distribution, a powerful and commonly used test statistic is based on the sum of the observations. Let $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ be the lifetimes of the $n$ generators in the sample. A key result in mathematical statistics states that if $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed as $\\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda=1/\\mu$, then the quantity $2\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$ follows a chi-squared distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom, i.e., $2\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \\sim \\chi^2_{2n}$.\n\nWe construct our test based on this property. Under the null hypothesis, the mean is $\\mu_0 = 5000$, which corresponds to a rate parameter of $\\lambda_0 = 1/\\mu_0 = 1/5000$. So, under $H_0$, the test statistic\n$$S = 2\\lambda_0 \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = \\frac{2}{\\mu_0} \\sum_{i=1}^n X_i$$\nfollows a chi-squared distribution with $2n$ degrees of freedom. In our case, the sample size is $n=10$, so the degrees of freedom are $2n = 2(10) = 20$.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is $H_a: \\mu > 5000$. A larger sample mean, $\\bar{X} = (\\sum X_i)/n$, provides evidence in favor of $H_a$. A large sample mean corresponds to a large sum $\\sum X_i$, which in turn corresponds to a large value of the test statistic $S$. Therefore, we have a right-tailed test. We will reject $H_0$ if the observed value of our statistic, $s_{obs}$, is greater than a certain critical value. The problem provides this critical value as 31.410 for a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nNow, we calculate the observed value of the test statistic, $s_{obs}$, using the given data:\nSample size, $n=10$.\nSum of lifetimes, $\\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = 60,000$ hours.\nNull hypothesis mean, $\\mu_0 = 5000$ hours.\n\n$$s_{obs} = \\frac{2}{\\mu_0} \\sum_{i=1}^{10} x_i = \\frac{2}{5000} \\times 60,000 = \\frac{120,000}{5000} = 24$$\n\nFinally, we compare the observed statistic to the critical value.\nObserved statistic: $s_{obs} = 24$.\nCritical value (from the problem statement): $c = 31.410$.\n\nSince $s_{obs} = 24$ is not greater than the critical value of $31.410$, the test statistic does not fall into the rejection region. Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level to reject the null hypothesis. The correct conclusion is to \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\".\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. The team should reject the null hypothesis. This is incorrect.\nB. The team should fail to reject the null hypothesis. This is the correct conclusion.\nC. The results are inconclusive because the sample size is too small. This is a misinterpretation. Hypothesis testing provides a definite conclusion (reject or fail to reject) based on the chosen framework.\nD. The test cannot be performed because both the population mean and variance are unknown. This is incorrect. The test is specifically designed for this situation. For an exponential distribution, the variance is $\\mu^2$, so knowing the mean determines the variance. The test makes an assumption about the mean under the null hypothesis to proceed.\nE. The team should accept the null hypothesis as proven true. This is a common logical fallacy. Failing to reject the null hypothesis simply means there is not enough evidence to discard it, not that it has been proven true.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is B.",

            "problem": "A computational biology team uses Ribonucleic Acid sequencing (RNA-seq) to test whether a transcription factor knockdown changes the mean normalized expression of a target gene relative to an untreated control. They collect biological replicates from two independent groups (knockdown and control), with $n_{\\text{KD}}=4$ and $n_{\\text{CTRL}}=4$ replicates, respectively. They perform a pre-specified two-sided test comparing group means at significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ and obtain a $p$-value of $p=0.12$. Based on this non-significant result, a team member writes in the draft: “there is no effect.”\n\nWhich option both correctly states the null and alternative hypotheses at the population level for this analysis and gives the most accurate reason why the team cannot conclude “there is no effect”?\n\nA. $H_0$: the difference in population mean expression is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population mean expression is $\\neq 0$. Because $p=0.12 > \\alpha=0.05$, the test fails to reject $H_0$.

Because $p=0.12 > \\alpha=0.05$, we accept $H_0$ and conclude there is no effect.\n\nC. $H_0$: the sample means are equal; $H_A$: the sample means differ.

Since $p=0.12$, there is a $12\\%$ chance the null hypothesis is true; this large probability indicates there is likely no effect.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem lies in the correct formulation and interpretation of a null hypothesis significance test (NHST). Let $\\mu_{\\text{KD}}$ represent the true population mean of normalized expression for the target gene in the knockdown condition, and let $\\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$ represent the true population mean in the control condition. The goal is to test for a difference between these two population means.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is the hypothesis of \"no effect\" or \"no difference\". It posits that the knockdown has no effect on the mean expression level. Mathematically, this is expressed as the equality of the population means.\n$$H_0: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} = \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$H_0: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} - \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}} = 0$$\n\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, is the hypothesis that there is an effect. The problem specifies a \"two-sided test\", which means we are interested in detecting a difference in either direction (an increase or a decrease in expression). Mathematically, this is expressed as an inequality of the population means.\n$$H_A: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} \\neq \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$H_A: \\mu_{\\text{KD}} - \\mu_{\\text{CTRL}} \\neq 0$$\n\nThe test was conducted at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$. This value, $\\alpha$, is the pre-defined threshold for the probability of a Type I error (incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis). The test yielded a $p$-value of $p=0.12$. The decision rule in NHST is to compare the $p$-value to $\\alpha$.\nSince $p = 0.12 > \\alpha = 0.05$, the result is not statistically significant. The correct conclusion from this is that we \"fail to reject the null hypothesis\".\n\nIt is a grave logical error to interpret \"failing to reject $H_0$\" as \"accepting $H_0$\" or \"proving $H_0$ is true\". The absence of evidence against $H_0$ is not evidence for the truth of $H_0$. This is particularly important in studies with low statistical power.\n\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect). It is equal to $1-\\beta$, where $\\beta$ is the probability of a Type II error (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). Power is positively correlated with sample size ($n$), effect size, and the significance level ($\\alpha$). In this experiment, the sample sizes are extremely small ($n_{\\text{KD}}=4$, $n_{\\text{CTRL}}=4$). Such small sample sizes result in very low statistical power. A low-powered study has a high probability ($\\beta$) of failing to detect a true effect, even if one exists.\n\nTherefore, the non-significant result ($p=0.12$) is inconclusive. It could mean that there is truly no effect (i.e., $H_0$ is true), or it could mean that there is a real effect, but the experiment was too underpowered to detect it (a Type II error). To conclude \"there is no effect\" is an overstatement that the data do not support.\n\nLet's evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\nA. $H_0$: the difference in population mean expression is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population mean expression is $\\neq 0$. Because $p=0.12 > \\alpha=0.05$, the test fails to reject $H_0$. With small $n$, statistical power is low (higher probability of Type II error), so a non-significant result is not evidence that the true effect is exactly $0$.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are correctly stated for a two-sided test on population means.\n- **Reasoning**: The comparison $p > \\alpha$ and the conclusion \"fails to reject $H_0$\" are correct. The explanation, linking small sample size ($n$) to low statistical power and a higher probability of Type II error, is the precise reason why one cannot conclude there is \"no effect\". This statement is entirely correct and provides the most accurate and complete explanation.\n\nB. $H_0$: there is a true effect; $H_A$: there is no true effect. Because $p=0.12 > \\alpha=0.05$, we accept $H_0$ and conclude there is no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The formulation of $H_0$ and $H_A$ is fundamentally reversed. The null hypothesis must be the statement of no effect.\n- **Reasoning**: The conclusion \"we accept $H_0$\" is a common but profound statistical error. Furthermore, accepting their incorrectly stated $H_0$ (\"there is a true effect\") would lead to the opposite conclusion of what they wrote (\"conclude there is no effect\"). This option is a cascade of errors.\n\nC. $H_0$: the sample means are equal; $H_A$: the sample means differ. Because the sample size is small, the Type I error rate is inflated, so we cannot trust the test and should assume there is no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are stated in terms of *sample* means, not *population* means. Hypothesis tests make inferences about populations, not describe samples. We can directly calculate and compare sample means; no test is needed for that.\n- **Reasoning**: The claim that small sample size inflates the Type I error rate is false. The Type I error rate is controlled by the chosen $\\alpha$, which is fixed at $0.05$. Small sample size increases the Type II error rate (reduces power), not the Type I error rate. The final assertion \"should assume there is no effect\" is an unsubstantiated leap.\n\nD. $H_0$: the difference in population medians is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population medians is $>0$. Given a prior expectation of up-regulation, a two-sided test proving non-significance implies no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The problem specifies a test of *means*, not *medians*. It also specifies a *two-sided* test ($\\neq$), while this option presents a *one-sided* test ($>$).\n- **Reasoning**: The logic is flawed. A non-significant result from any test does not \"prove\" or \"imply\" no effect. The mention of a two-sided test is contradicted by the stated one-sided $H_A$.\n\nE. $H_0$: the difference in population mean expression is $0$; $H_A$: the difference in population mean expression is $\\neq 0$. Since $p=0.12$, there is a $12\\%$ chance the null hypothesis is true; this large probability indicates there is likely no effect.\n- **Hypotheses**: The hypotheses are stated correctly.\n- **Reasoning**: The interpretation of the $p$-value is fundamentally wrong. The $p$-value is $P(\\text{data as or more extreme} | H_0 \\text{ is true})$, not $P(H_0 \\text{ is true} | \\text{data})$. Asserting that the $p$-value is the probability of the null hypothesis being true is one of the most common and serious misinterpretations in statistics.",
