Under the null hypothesis of independence with fixed margins (the conditional model underlying Fisher’s exact test (FET)), the distribution of the top-left cell count is determined by sampling without replacement.\n\nUsing only the definitions of a $2 \\times 2$ table, fixed row and column margins, and elementary combinatorial counting for sampling without replacement, do the following:\n\n- Compute the row totals $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$, the column totals $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, and the grand total $N$.\n- From the fixed margins, determine the set of all feasible values of the top-left cell $a'$ that preserve the margins.\n- Using the counting argument for sampling without replacement, express the conditional probability of observing a table with $a'=k$ as a function of the margins and $k$.\n- For testing $H_{0}$ (independence) versus the one-sided alternative of positive association (i.e., larger $a'$ indicates stronger evidence against $H_{0}$), compute the one-sided Fisher’s exact $p$-value $\\Pr(A \\ge a \\mid \\text{margins fixed})$ for the observed table.\n\nReport only the one-sided Fisher’s exact $p$-value as your final numeric answer, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it presents a standard, well-posed question in biostatistics with all necessary data for a unique solution. We will proceed by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe observed $2 \\times 2$ contingency table is given by the cell counts $(a, b; c, d) = (3, 1; 0, 4)$. We can represent this table as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n  \\text{Outcome 1}  \\text{Outcome 2}  \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Group 1}  a=3  b=1  n_1 \\\\\n\\text{Group 2}  c=0  d=4  n_2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total}  m_1  m_2  N\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the row totals ($n_{1}$, $n_{2}$), column totals ($m_{1}$, $m_{2}$), and the grand total ($N$). These are the fixed margins for the conditional test.\nRow totals:\n$n_{1} = a + b = 3 + 1 = 4$\n$n_{2} = c + d = 0 + 4 = 4$\n\nColumn totals:\n$m_{1} = a + c = 3 + 0 = 3$\n$m_{2} = b + d = 1 + 4 = 5$\n\nGrand total:\n$N = n_{1} + n_{2} = 4 + 4 = 8$\nAs a check, $N = m_{1} + m_{2} = 3 + 5 = 8$, which is consistent.\n\nSecond, we determine the set of all feasible values for the top-left cell count, which we will denote by $a'$, that preserve these fixed margins. A general table with these margins can be written as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n  \\text{Col 1}  \\text{Col 2}  \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Row 1}  a'  4-a'  4 \\\\\n\\text{Row 2}  3-a'  1+a'  4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total}  3  5  8\n\\end{array}\n$$\nSince each cell count must be a non-negative integer, we have the following constraints on $a'$:\n$a' \\ge 0$\n$4 - a' \\ge 0 \\implies a' \\le 4$\n$3 - a' \\ge 0 \\implies a' \\le 3$\n$1 + a' \\ge 0 \\implies a' \\ge -1$\n\nCombining these inequalities, we find that $0 \\le a' \\le 3$. Thus, the set of all feasible integer values for the top-left cell is $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThird, we express the conditional probability of observing a table with $a' = k$ for some value $k$. Under the null hypothesis of independence with fixed margins, the count $a'$ follows a hypergeometric distribution. This arises from a combinatorial argument of sampling without replacement. The total number of ways to choose $m_{1}=3$ individuals for the first column from a total of $N=8$ individuals is $\\binom{N}{m_{1}} = \\binom{8}{3}$. The number of ways to form a specific table with $a'=k$ is to choose $k$ individuals from the first row (with $n_{1}=4$ individuals) for the first column, which is $\\binom{n_{1}}{k} = \\binom{4}{k}$, and to choose the remaining $m_{1}-k=3-k$ individuals for the first column from the second row (with $n_{2}=4$ individuals), which is $\\binom{n_{2}}{m_{1}-k} = \\binom{4}{3-k}$.\n\nThe probability of observing a table with the top-left cell equal to $k$ is therefore:\n$$ P(A=k) = \\frac{\\binom{n_1}{k} \\binom{n_2}{m_1-k}}{\\binom{N}{m_1}} = \\frac{\\binom{4}{k}\\binom{4}{3-k}}{\\binom{8}{3}} $$\n\nFourth, we compute the one-sided Fisher's exact $p$-value. The observed table has $a=3$. The alternative hypothesis is for positive association, which corresponds to larger values of the top-left cell count $a'$. The $p$-value is the probability of observing a table with a count as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, in the direction of the alternative.\n$$ p\\text{-value} = \\Pr(A \\ge a \\mid \\text{margins fixed}) = \\Pr(A \\ge 3) $$\nSince the possible values for the random variable $A$ are $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, the event $A \\ge 3$ consists of only the outcome $A=3$. Therefore, the $p$-value is simply $P(A=3)$.\n\nWe calculate this probability using the formula derived above:\n$$ p\\text{-value} = P(A=3) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{3-3}}{\\binom{8}{3}} = \\frac{\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{4}{0}}{\\binom{8}{3}} $$\nWe compute the binomial coefficients:\n$\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = 4$\n$\\binom{4}{0} = \\frac{4!}{0!(4-0)!} = 1$\n$\\binom{8}{3} = \\frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 56$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ p\\text{-value} = \\frac{4 \\times 1}{56} = \\frac{4}{56} = \\frac{1}{14} $$\n\nThe problem asks for a numeric answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{1}{14} \\approx 0.07142857\\dots $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.07143$.",

            "problem": "A small randomized pilot study evaluates whether a prophylactic treatment reduces the risk of a binary infection outcome. The $2 \\times 2$ table of counts is:\n\n- Treated group: $0$ infected, $8$ not infected.\n- Control group: $4$ infected, $2$ not infected.\n\nAssume the study design yields fixed margins on treatment allocation and on total number of infections. Consider the odds ratio (OR) parameter for association and the conditional approach underlying Fisher’s exact test.\n\nFrom first principles:\n\n- Define the odds in each group and the odds ratio (OR) as the ratio of odds between treated and control groups. Use the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the OR based on the cell counts, and reason about its behavior when a cell count is zero.\n- Under the null hypothesis of no association between treatment and infection and conditioning on the fixed margins, derive the exact distribution of the number of infected subjects in the treated group and use it to compute the exact one-sided $p$-value for the alternative that the treatment is protective.\n- Explain whether any continuity corrections or small-sample adjustments are required for Fisher’s exact $p$-value, and contrast this with small-sample adjustments commonly used for estimation of the OR when a zero cell occurs.\n\nWhich option best captures the correct conclusions for this dataset and context?\n\nA.

The MLE of the odds ratio equals $0$ for these counts; Fisher’s exact test is valid without any continuity correction, and the one-sided exact $p$-value for a protective effect is approximately $0.015$; adding $0.5$ to each cell (a Haldane–Anscombe correction) yields a finite odds ratio estimate useful for small-sample estimation.\n\nC.

The MLE of the odds ratio equals $0$, and Fisher’s exact two-sided $p$-value is exactly $0.03$ for any definition of “two-sided”; adding $1$ only to the zero cell produces an unbiased odds ratio estimate in small samples.",
            "solution": "Begin with the core definitions. For a binary outcome, the odds in a group are defined as $p/(1-p)$, where $p$ is the group’s event probability. In a $2 \\times 2$ table with cell counts\n$\n\\begin{array}{cc}\na  b \\\\\nc  d\n\\end{array}\n$\ncorresponding to treated infected $(a)$, treated not infected $(b)$, control infected $(c)$, and control not infected $(d)$, the sample odds in the treated group are $a/b$ (events over non-events), and in the control group are $c/d$. The odds ratio (OR) is the ratio of these odds, which simplifies to $\\text{OR} = (a d)/(b c)$. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the OR under a multinomial sampling model coincides with this sample odds ratio.\n\nFor the given data, we have $a = 0$, $b = 8$, $c = 4$, and $d = 2$. Therefore,\n$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{a d}{b c} = \\frac{0 \\cdot 2}{8 \\cdot 4} = 0.\n$\nThis is a boundary estimate: the log-odds ratio $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is $-\\infty$, and large-sample Wald procedures for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ are not applicable because they require finite counts in all cells to form the usual variance estimate (which involves reciprocals of the cell counts). A commonly used small-sample adjustment for estimation is the Haldane–Anscombe correction, which adds $0.5$ to each cell to reduce bias and avoid infinities. With this correction, the adjusted counts are $a^{*} = 0.5$, $b^{*} = 8.5$, $c^{*} = 4.5$, and $d^{*} = 2.5$, yielding an adjusted odds ratio\n$\n\\widetilde{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{a^{*} d^{*}}{b^{*} c^{*}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 2.5}{8.5 \\times 4.5} = \\frac{1.25}{38.25} \\approx 0.03268,\n$\na finite value that reflects the strong apparent protective effect while enabling approximate interval estimation.\n\nNext, consider Fisher’s exact test. Under the null hypothesis of no association between treatment and infection, and conditioning on the fixed margins (total treated $= 8$, total control $= 6$, total infected $= 4$, total not infected $= 10$), the random variable $X$ equal to the number of infected in the treated group follows a hypergeometric distribution. The support of $X$ is $\\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, and for each $k$,\n$\n\\mathbb{P}(X = k) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{k} \\binom{10}{8 - k}}{\\binom{14}{8}}.\n$\nThe observed value is $x_{\\text{obs}} = 0$. For the one-sided alternative that the treatment is protective (fewer infections among treated), the exact one-sided $p$-value is\n$\np_{\\text{one-sided}} = \\mathbb{P}(X \\le 0) = \\mathbb{P}(X = 0) = \\frac{\\binom{4}{0} \\binom{10}{8}}{\\binom{14}{8}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot 45}{3003} \\approx 0.01498.\n$\nThus, the one-sided exact $p$-value is approximately $0.015$. Importantly, this calculation is valid as stated; Fisher’s exact test does not require any continuity correction or small-sample adjustment to compute $p$-values, even when a cell count is zero, because the test is based on the exact hypergeometric distribution conditioned on the margins.\n\nTwo-sided exact $p$-values in Fisher’s test depend on how “tables as or more extreme than observed” are defined. A common approach sums the probabilities of all tables with hypergeometric probability less than or equal to the observed table’s probability, which in this dataset yields a two-sided $p=0.01498$ because no other table has a probability less than or equal to $\\mathbb{P}(X=0)$. Another approach doubles the smaller one-sided $p$-value, giving approximately $0.02996$. The key point is that the exact test itself remains well-defined without continuity corrections; small-sample adjustments like adding $0.5$ are principally for estimation of the odds ratio or for asymptotic approximations, not for the exact $p$-value. An additional small-sample technique sometimes used to reduce conservatism is the mid-$p$, which, for a one-sided test, can be defined as $\\mathbb{P}(X  x_{\\text{obs}}) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\mathbb{P}(X = x_{\\text{obs}})$; this yields a value between the classical exact $p$-value and the nominal level but is not strictly exact in the sense of guaranteed type I error control at or below the nominal level.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: It asserts the MLE is infinite. Here, with $a = 0$ (and $b, c, d  0$), $\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = 0$, not infinite; infinities arise when $b = 0$ or $c = 0$ (division by zero), or when $a$ or $d$ are positive while the opposing non-event cell is zero. It also incorrectly claims Fisher’s test requires adding $0.5$, which it does not. The fixed statement that the two-sided exact $p$-value is approximately $0.03$ “regardless of definition” is incorrect because two-sided definitions differ. Incorrect.\n\n- Option B: It correctly states that $\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = 0$ for these counts; that Fisher’s exact test is valid without continuity corrections; that the one-sided protective $p$-value is approximately $0.015$; and that adding $0.5$ to each cell (Haldane–Anscombe) yields a finite small-sample odds ratio estimate. Correct.\n\n- Option C: The odds ratio is not equal to the risk ratio in general; they coincide only under special circumstances. Fisher’s exact test is an exact conditional test, not an approximation to a chi-square $p$-value, and this is especially important with small samples or zero cells. Mid-$p$ values are typically smaller (less conservative) than classical exact $p$-values, not larger. Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: Both the odds ratio and Fisher’s exact $p$-value are defined here; dropping a row to analyze a $1 \\times 2$ table discards information and is not standard. Mid-$p$ adjustments are used by some practitioners as a compromise in small samples; they are not “invalid” per se, though they are not strictly exact. Incorrect.\n\n- Option E: While $\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = 0$ is correct, the claim that the two-sided $p$-value is exactly $0.03$ “for any definition” is false; two-sided definitions differ. Adding $1$ only to the zero cell is not a standard bias-reducing small-sample adjustment and does not yield an unbiased odds ratio; the Haldane–Anscombe correction adds $0.5$ to all cells. Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the option that best captures the correct conclusions is Option B.",

            "solution": "### Solution\n\nThe problem requires a detailed analysis of a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table using Fisher's exact test, starting from first principles.\n\nLet the general $2 \\times 2$ table be represented as:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n  \\text{Outcome}  \\text{No Outcome}  \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Exposed}  a  b  r_1 \\\\\n\\text{Unexposed}  c  d  r_2 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total}  c_1  c_2  N\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe given margins are $r_1=5$, $r_2=4$, $c_1=5$, $c_2=4$, and $N=9$. Under the null hypothesis of independence, with fixed margins, the probability of observing a particular table is given by the hypergeometric distribution. This arises from considering the number of ways to choose the $c_1$ individuals with the outcome from the $N$ total individuals, such that $a$ of them come from the $r_1$ exposed individuals and $c_1-a$ come from the $r_2$ unexposed individuals.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose $c_1=5$ individuals from $N=9$ to have the outcome is $\\binom{N}{c_1} = \\binom{9}{5}$.\nThe number of ways to choose $a$ individuals from the $r_1=5$ exposed individuals is $\\binom{r_1}{a} = \\binom{5}{a}$.\nThe number of ways to choose the remaining $c_1-a = 5-a$ individuals from the $r_2=4$ unexposed individuals is $\\binom{r_2}{c_1-a} = \\binom{4}{5-a}$.\n\n**1. Probability Mass Function and Enumeration**\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the random variable $A$ (the count in the upper-left cell) is the ratio of the number of ways to form a table with count $a$ to the total number of ways to form a table with the given margins:\n$$ P(A=a) = \\frac{\\binom{r_1}{a} \\binom{r_2}{c_1-a}}{\\binom{N}{c_1}} = \\frac{\\binom{5}{a} \\binom{4}{5-a}}{\\binom{9}{5}} $$\nThe denominator is $\\binom{9}{5} = \\frac{9!}{5!4!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126$.\n\nThe attainable values for $a$ are constrained by the requirement that all cell counts must be non-negative:\n- $a \\ge 0$\n- $b = r_1 - a = 5 - a \\ge 0 \\implies a \\le 5$\n- $c = c_1 - a = 5 - a \\ge 0 \\implies a \\le 5$\n- $d = r_2 - c = 4 - (5-a) = a - 1 \\ge 0 \\implies a \\ge 1$\nCombining these constraints, the support for $A$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nNow, we enumerate the probabilities for each attainable value of $a$:\n- For $a=1$: $P(A=1) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{1}\\binom{4}{4}}{126} = \\frac{5 \\times 1}{126} = \\frac{5}{126}$\n- For $a=2$: $P(A=2) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{2}\\binom{4}{3}}{126} = \\frac{10 \\times 4}{126} = \\frac{40}{126}$\n- For $a=3$: $P(A=3) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{3}\\binom{4}{2}}{126} = \\frac{10 \\times 6}{126} = \\frac{60}{126}$\n- For $a=4$: $P(A=4) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{4}\\binom{4}{1}}{126} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{126} = \\frac{20}{126}$\n- For $a=5$: $P(A=5) = \\frac{\\binom{5}{5}\\binom{4}{0}}{126} = \\frac{1 \\times 1}{126} = \\frac{1}{126}$\nThe sum of probabilities is $\\frac{5+40+60+20+1}{126} = \\frac{126}{126} = 1$, confirming correctness.\n\n**2. One-Sided Tail Probabilities**\n\nThe observed value is $a_{obs} = 3$. We compute the one-sided cumulative probabilities based on this observation.\n- The left-tail probability is $P(A \\leq 3)$:\n$$ P(A \\leq 3) = P(A=1) + P(A=2) + P(A=3) = \\frac{5}{126} + \\frac{40}{126} + \\frac{60}{126} = \\frac{105}{126} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\n- The right-tail probability is $P(A \\geq 3)$:\n$$ P(A \\geq 3) = P(A=3) + P(A=4) + P(A=5) = \\frac{60}{126} + \\frac{20}{126} + \\frac{1}{126} = \\frac{81}{126} = \\frac{9}{14} $$\n\n**3. Counterexample to Naive Doubling**\n\nThe naive method for a two-sided p-value involves doubling the smaller one-sided tail probability. A common definition for one-sided p-values is $P(A \\ge a_{obs})$ for a right-tailed test and $P(A \\le a_{obs})$ for a left-tailed test. Let's use these definitions as implied. The smaller of the two is $P(A \\geq 3) = \\frac{81}{126}$.\nDoubling this value gives:\n$$ 2 \\times P(A \\geq 3) = 2 \\times \\frac{81}{126} = \\frac{162}{126} \\approx 1.2857 $$\nThis value is greater than $1$, which is impossible for a probability or p-value. This serves as a counterexample.\n\nThis anomaly occurs because the distribution is discrete and, in this case, the observed value $a=3$ is the mode of the distribution. The \"left tail\" $P(A \\leq 3)$ and the \"right tail\" $P(A \\geq 3)$ are not disjoint; they overlap at the point mass $P(A=3)$. Their sum is:\n$$ P(A \\leq 3) + P(A \\geq 3) = \\sum_{k=1}^{5} P(A=k) + P(A=3) = 1 + P(A=3) $$\nIn this case, $1 + \\frac{60}{126} = \\frac{186}{126}$. When both $P(A \\leq a_{obs})$ and $P(A \\geq a_{obs})$ are greater than $0.5$, as they are here ($105/126 \\approx 0.833$ and $81/126 \\approx 0.643$), doubling the minimum of the two must result in a value greater than $1$. This situation is common when the observed value is at or near the center of a discrete probability distribution, making the point probability $P(A=a_{obs})$ large.\n\n**4. Correct Two-Sided p-value**\n\nThe correct two-sided p-value for Fisher's exact test is defined as the sum of the probabilities of all tables that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed table. \"More extreme\" is interpreted as having a probability less than or equal to the probability of the observed table.\nThe observed table has $a=3$, and its probability is $P(A=3) = \\frac{60}{126}$.\nWe must sum the probabilities $P(A=a)$ for all attainable values of $a$ such that $P(A=a) \\leq P(A=3)$.\n\nLet's compare the probability of each possible table to the probability of the observed table:\n- $P(A=1) = \\frac{5}{126} \\leq \\frac{60}{126}$ (True)\n- $P(A=2) = \\frac{40}{126} \\leq \\frac{60}{126}$ (True)\n- $P(A=3) = \\frac{60}{126} \\leq \\frac{60}{126}$ (True)\n- $P(A=4) = \\frac{20}{126} \\leq \\frac{60}{126}$ (True)\n- $P(A=5) = \\frac{1}{126} \\leq \\frac{60}{126}$ (True)\n\nThe condition $P(A=a) \\leq P(A=3)$ is satisfied for all possible values of $a$ in its support, because $a=3$ corresponds to the mode of the distribution (the most probable outcome).\nTherefore, the two-sided p-value is the sum of the probabilities of all possible tables:\n$$ p_{\\text{two-sided}} = P(A=1) + P(A=2) + P(A=3) + P(A=4) + P(A=5) $$\n$$ p_{\\text{two-sided}} = \\frac{5}{126} + \\frac{40}{126} + \\frac{60}{126} + \\frac{20}{126} + \\frac{1}{126} = \\frac{126}{126} = 1 $$\nThe result is exactly $1$. The problem requires this value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n\nFinal value: $1.000$",
