It describes a standard scenario in survival analysis involving a stratified Cox model with time-dependent covariates. All necessary information is provided, the data is consistent, and the terminology is precise. The problem is a textbook application of established statistical theory and does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires two parts: constructing the start-stop data for Subject A and then deriving its contribution to the partial likelihood.\n\n#### Part 1: Start-Stop Representation for Subject A\n\nFor a subject with a time-dependent covariate, the observation period is broken into intervals defined by the covariate measurement times and the final event or censoring time. Each interval forms a separate record in the \"start-stop\" format. Subject A has measurements at times $t=0, 2, 5$ and experiences the event at $t=6$. The covariate value is constant within each interval. The problem states the covariate is \"constant on open intervals between measurement times and takes the updated value on the right-closed endpoints,\" which is standardly interpreted as the value being constant on intervals of the form $(t_{start}, t_{stop}]$.\n\nFor Subject A, the intervals are $(0, 2]$, $(2, 5]$, and $(5, 6]$.\n1.  **Interval 1**: From $t=0$ to $t=2$. The start time is $0$ and the stop time is $2$. The covariate value is taken from the beginning of the interval, $X(t) = Z(0) = 0$ for $t \\in (0, 2]$. No event occurs in this interval, so the event indicator $\\delta$ is $0$.\n2.  **Interval 2**: From $t=2$ to $t=5$. The start time is $2$ and the stop time is $5$. The covariate value is updated to $X(t) = Z(2) = 1$ for $t \\in (2, 5]$. No event occurs, so $\\delta=0$.\n3.  **Interval 3**: From $t=5$ to the event time $t=6$. The start time is $5$ and the stop time is $6$. The covariate value is updated to $X(t) = Z(5) = 0$ for $t \\in (5, 6]$. The event occurs at the end of this interval, so $\\delta=1$.\n\nThe start-stop representation for Subject A is as follows:\n| Start Time ($t_{start}$) | Stop Time ($t_{stop}$) | Covariate Value ($X$) | Event Indicator ($\\delta$) |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|\n| $0$                      | $2$                    | $0$                   | $0$                        |\n| $2$                      | $5$                    | $1$                   | $0$                        |\n| $5$                      | $6$                    | $0$                   | $1$                        |\n\n#### Part 2: Contribution to the Partial Likelihood\n\nThe Cox partial likelihood is constructed from terms corresponding to each observed event. For an event occurring at time $t_i$ for individual $i$ in stratum $s$, the contribution to the likelihood is the probability that this specific individual fails, given that one failure occurred at $t_i$ among the set of individuals at risk in stratum $s$. This is given by the ratio of the hazard of the failing individual to the sum of the hazards of all individuals in the risk set.\n\nThe contribution for individual $i$ failing at time $t_i$ in stratum $s_i$ is:\n$$\nL_i = \\frac{h_i(t_i | X_i(t_i))}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i, s_i)} h_j(t_i | X_j(t_i))}\n$$\nwhere $R(t_i, s_i)$ is the risk set at time $t_i$ in stratum $s_i$.\n\nSubstituting the given model $h_{s}(t \\mid X(t)) = h_{0,s}(t)\\exp(\\beta X(t))$:\n$$\nL_i = \\frac{h_{0,s_i}(t_i)\\exp(\\beta X_i(t_i))}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i, s_i)} h_{0,s_i}(t_i)\\exp(\\beta X_j(t_i))}\n$$\nThe common baseline hazard term $h_{0,s_i}(t_i)$ for stratum $s_i$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\nL_i = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta X_i(t_i))}{\\sum_{j \\in R(t_i, s_i)} \\exp(\\beta X_j(t_i))}\n$$\n\nWe need to calculate this contribution for Subject A's event at $t=6$ in stratum $s=1$. The risk set $R(6, 1)$ is given as $\\{A, B, C\\}$. We must determine the value of the covariate for each of these subjects at the event time $t=6$.\n\n- **Subject A**: The event is at $t=6$. The last covariate update was $Z(5)=0$. Thus, the covariate value for Subject A at $t=6$ is $X_A(6)=0$.\n\n- **Subject B**: The last covariate update before $t=6$ was $W(4)=2$. Thus, the covariate value for Subject B at $t=6$ is $X_B(6)=2$.\n\n- **Subject C**: The covariate is constant, $U(t) \\equiv 0.5$. Thus, the covariate value for Subject C at $t=6$ is $X_C(6)=0.5$.\n\nNow, we can construct the likelihood term for Subject A's event.\n\nThe numerator is for Subject A, the individual who had the event:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = \\exp(\\beta X_A(6)) = \\exp(\\beta \\cdot 0) = 1\n$$\n\nThe denominator is the sum over all individuals in the risk set $R(6, 1) = \\{A, B, C\\}$:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\sum_{j \\in \\{A, B, C\\}} \\exp(\\beta X_j(6)) = \\exp(\\beta X_A(6)) + \\exp(\\beta X_B(6)) + \\exp(\\beta X_C(6))\n$$\nSubstituting the covariate values:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\exp(\\beta \\cdot 0) + \\exp(\\beta \\cdot 2) + \\exp(\\beta \\cdot 0.5)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = 1 + \\exp(2\\beta) + \\exp(0.5\\beta)\n$$\n\nThe contribution of Subject A's event to the partial likelihood is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\nL_A = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2\\beta) + \\exp(0.5\\beta)}\n$$\nThis is the final simplified analytic expression in terms of $\\beta$.",

For an event at time $t$, the corresponding term in the likelihood is the probability that the specific subject who failed was the one to fail, conditioned on the set of subjects at risk at that time (the risk set) and the fact that one failure occurred.\n\nThe Cox proportional hazards model specifies the hazard for subject $i$ at time $t$ as:\n$$ h(t \\mid X_i(t)) = h_0(t) \\exp(\\beta X_i(t)) $$\nwhere $h_0(t)$ is the baseline hazard, $X_i(t)$ is the value of the time-dependent covariate for subject $i$ at time $t$, and $\\beta$ is the regression coefficient.\n\nThe general formula for the partial likelihood, assuming no tied event times, is:\n$$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{h(t_{(j)} \\mid X_{i_j}(t_{(j)}))}{\\sum_{l \\in R(t_{(j)})} h(t_{(j)} \\mid X_l(t_{(j)}))} $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of distinct event times, $t_{(j)}$ are the ordered event times, $i_j$ is the index of the subject who fails at time $t_{(j)}$, and $R(t_{(j)})$ is the risk set at time $t_{(j)}$ (i.e., the set of all subjects who have not yet failed or been censored just prior to $t_{(j)}$).\n\nSubstituting the Cox model hazard function into this formula, the baseline hazard term $h_0(t_{(j)})$ cancels out from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ L(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{h_0(t_{(j)}) \\exp(\\beta X_{i_j}(t_{(j)}))}{\\sum_{l \\in R(t_{(j)})} h_0(t_{(j)}) \\exp(\\beta X_l(t_{(j)}))} = \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\frac{\\exp(\\beta X_{i_j}(t_{(j)}))}{\\sum_{l \\in R(t_{(j)})} \\exp(\\beta X_l(t_{(j)}))} $$\nWe are given three subjects with distinct event times $T_1=2$, $T_2=4$, and $T_3=6$.

Define the weights $\\exp\\{\\beta X_i(5)\\}$ for each $i \\in \\mathcal{R}_A(5)$.\n\nCompute the weights for the three failures:\n- For subject 1: $X_1(5)=1$, so $\\exp\\{\\beta X_1(5)\\}=\\exp\\{0.4\\times 1\\}=\\exp(0.4)\\approx 1.4918246976412703$.\n- For subject 2: $X_2(5)=3$, so $\\exp\\{\\beta X_2(5)\\}=\\exp\\{0.4\\times 3\\}=\\exp(1.2)\\approx 3.3201169227365472$.\n- For subject 3: $X_3(5)=2$, so $\\exp\\{\\beta X_3(5)\\}=\\exp\\{0.4\\times 2\\}=\\exp(0.8)\\approx 2.225540928492468$.\n\nLet\n$$\nD \\equiv \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{D}_A(5)} \\exp\\{\\beta X_i(5)\\} \\approx 1.4918246976412703 + 3.3201169227365472 + 2.225540928492468 = 7.037482548870285.\n$$\nThe numerator of both approximations is the product of the failing individuals’ relative risks,\n$$\nN \\equiv \\prod_{i\\in \\mathcal{D}_A(5)} \\exp\\{\\beta X_i(5)\\} = \\exp\\{\\beta[X_1(5)+X_2(5)+X_3(5)]\\} = \\exp(0.4\\times 6)=\\exp(2.4)\\approx 11.023176380641601.\n$$\n\nCompute the weights for the additional five at-risk, non-failing subjects:\n- Subject 4: $X_4(5)=0$, weight $\\exp(0.4\\times 0)=\\exp(0)=1$.\n- Subject 5: $X_5(5)=1.5$, weight $\\exp(0.4\\times 1.5)=\\exp(0.6)\\approx 1.822118800390509$.\n- Subject 6: $X_6(5)=2.2$, weight $\\exp(0.4\\times 2.2)=\\exp(0.88)\\approx 2.410899706417119$.\n- Subject 7: $X_7(5)=-0.5$, weight $\\exp(0.4\\times (-0.5))=\\exp(-0.2)\\approx 0.8187307530779818$.\n- Subject 8: $X_8(5)=3.1$, weight $\\exp(0.4\\times 3.1)=\\exp(1.24)\\approx 3.455613845$ (using $\\exp(1.24)=\\exp(1.2)\\exp(0.04)\\approx 3.3201169227365472\\times 1.0408107741923889$).\n\nSum over the stratum-specific risk set at $t=5$:\n$$\nW \\equiv \\sum_{i\\in \\mathcal{R}_A(5)} \\exp\\{\\beta X_i(5)\\} = D + \\sum_{j=4}^{8} \\exp\\{\\beta X_j(5)\\} \\approx 7.037482548870285 + (1 + 1.822118800390509 + 2.410899706417119 + 0.8187307530779818 + 3.455613845)\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nW \\approx 7.037482548870285 + 9.50736310488561 = 16.544845653755895.\n$$\n\nBreslow approximation: with $d=3$ tied failures, the contribution is\n$$\nL_{\\text{Breslow}}(5) = \\frac{N}{W^{d}} = \\frac{\\exp(2.4)}{W^{3}}.\n$$\nCompute $W^{3}$:\nFirst $W^{2}\\approx 273.731916582$ (from $(16.544845653755895)^{2}$), then\n$$\nW^{3} = W^{2}\\cdot W \\approx 273.731916582 \\times 16.544845653755895 \\approx 4{,}528.852303465874.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nL_{\\text{Breslow}}(5) \\approx \\frac{11.023176380641601}{4{,}528.852303465874} \\approx 0.0024330.\n$$\n\nEfron approximation: with $d=3$, the denominator is the product over $r=0,1,2$ of $\\left(W - \\frac{r}{d}D\\right)$, so the contribution is\n$$\nL_{\\text{Efron}}(5)=\\frac{N}{\\prod_{r=0}^{2}\\left(W - \\frac{r}{3}D\\right)}.\n$$\nCompute the three factors:\n$$\n\\frac{D}{3} \\approx \\frac{7.037482548870285}{3} \\approx 2.345827516290095,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{term}_{0} &= W \\approx 16.544845653755895,\\\\\n\\text{term}_{1} &= W - \\frac{1}{3}D \\approx 16.544845653755895 - 2.345827516290095 \\approx 14.199018137465800,\\\\\n\\text{term}_{2} &= W - \\frac{2}{3}D \\approx 16.544845653755895 - 4.691655032580190 \\approx 11.853190621175705.\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nMultiply the denominator:\n$$\n\\prod_{r=0}^{2}\\left(W - \\frac{r}{3}D\\right) \\approx 16.544845653755895 \\times 14.199018137465800 \\times 11.853190621175705 \\approx 2{,}784.558009.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nL_{\\text{Efron}}(5) \\approx \\frac{11.023176380641601}{2{,}784.558009} \\approx 0.0039601.\n$$\n\nThe requested ratio of the Efron to Breslow contributions is\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{L_{\\text{Efron}}(5)}{L_{\\text{Breslow}}(5)} = \\frac{W^{3}}{\\prod_{r=0}^{2}\\left(W - \\frac{r}{3}D\\right)} \\approx \\frac{4{,}528.852303465874}{2{,}784.558009} \\approx 1.62642.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the ratio is $1.626$. This numerical demonstration shows that when the tied failures have differing covariate values (affecting $D$), the Efron correction yields a larger contribution than Breslow in this setting, because the Efron denominator reduces the risk set sum progressively by fractions of the total failing risk, rather than raising the full risk set sum to the power $d$.",
