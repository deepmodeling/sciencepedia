The weight for study $i$ is $w_i = \\frac{1}{s_i^2}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the variances and corresponding weights for the three studies.\nThe given study estimates are $y_1=0.2$, $y_2=0.5$, and $y_3=-0.1$.\nThe given standard errors are $s_1=0.1$, $s_2=0.2$, and $s_3=0.15$.\n\nThe variances are:\n$s_1^2 = (0.1)^2 = 0.01$\n$s_2^2 = (0.2)^2 = 0.04$\n$s_3^2 = (0.15)^2 = 0.0225$\n\nThe inverse-variance weights are:\n$w_1 = \\frac{1}{s_1^2} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100$\n$w_2 = \\frac{1}{s_2^2} = \\frac{1}{0.04} = 25$\n$w_3 = \\frac{1}{s_3^2} = \\frac{1}{0.0225} = \\frac{1}{225/10000} = \\frac{10000}{225} = \\frac{400}{9}$\n\nThe pooled estimator $\\hat{\\mu}$ is calculated as:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i} $$\nFirst, we compute the sum of the weights, $\\sum w_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i = w_1 + w_2 + w_3 = 100 + 25 + \\frac{400}{9} = 125 + \\frac{400}{9} = \\frac{1125 + 400}{9} = \\frac{1525}{9} $$\nNext, we compute the sum of the weighted estimates, $\\sum w_i y_i$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i y_i = w_1 y_1 + w_2 y_2 + w_3 y_3 = 100(0.2) + 25(0.5) + \\frac{400}{9}(-0.1) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^3 w_i y_i = 20 + 12.5 - \\frac{40}{9} = 32.5 - \\frac{40}{9} = \\frac{65}{2} - \\frac{40}{9} = \\frac{585 - 80}{18} = \\frac{505}{18} $$\nNow, we can compute $\\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu} = \\frac{505/18}{1525/9} = \\frac{505}{18} \\cdot \\frac{9}{1525} = \\frac{505}{2 \\cdot 1525} = \\frac{505}{3050} = \\frac{101}{610} \\approx 0.16557377... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\mu} \\approx 0.1656$.\n\nThe variance of the pooled estimator is the reciprocal of the sum of the weights:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i} = \\frac{1}{1525/9} = \\frac{9}{1525} $$\nThe standard error of the pooled estimator is the square root of its variance:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{1525}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{1525}} \\approx 0.07682212... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $SE(\\hat{\\mu}) \\approx 0.07682$.\n\nA large-sample $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$ CI = \\hat{\\mu} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE(\\hat{\\mu}) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha = 0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$.

The principle is to choose the weights such that the estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ is unbiased and has minimum variance.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Fixed-Effect Weights\n\nThe fixed-effect model assumes a single common true effect $\\theta$ across all studies. Thus, the expected value of each study estimate is $E[y_i] = \\theta$. The variance of each study estimate is given as $\\text{Var}(y_i) = \\sigma_i^2$.\n\nThe expected value of the pooled estimator is:\n$$\nE[\\hat{\\theta}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i E[y_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \\theta = \\theta \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i\n$$\nFor the estimator to be unbiased, i.e., $E[\\hat{\\theta}] = \\theta$, the weights must sum to unity:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i = 1\n$$\nThe variance of the pooled estimator, assuming independence between studies, is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\text{Var}(y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\sigma_i^2\n$$\nWe must minimize this variance subject to the constraint $\\sum w_i = 1$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function is:\n$$\nL(w_1, \\dots, w_k, \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\sigma_i^2 - \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i - 1\\right)\n$$\nTaking the partial derivative with respect to an arbitrary weight $w_j$ and setting it to zero gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial w_j} = 2 w_j \\sigma_j^2 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies w_j = \\frac{\\lambda}{2 \\sigma_j^2}\n$$\nThis shows that the optimal (normalized) weights $w_j$ are proportional to the inverse of the within-study variances, $1/\\sigma_j^2$. The problem asks for the unnormalized weights. The unnormalized fixed-effect weight for study $i$, denoted $w_{i,FE}$, is therefore:\n$$\nw_{i,FE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i^2}\n$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of Random-Effects Weights\n\nThe random-effects model assumes that the true effects $\\theta_i$ are not identical but are drawn from a distribution with a common mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\tau^2$. The model for an observed effect $y_i$ is hierarchical:\n1. True effect: $\\theta_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\tau^2)$\n2. Observed effect given true effect: $y_i|\\theta_i \\sim N(\\theta_i, \\sigma_i^2)$\n\nThe marginal (unconditional) distribution of $y_i$ has an expected value $E[y_i] = E[E[y_i|\\theta_i]] = E[\\theta_i] = \\mu$. The marginal variance is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(y_i) = E[\\text{Var}(y_i|\\theta_i)] + \\text{Var}(E[y_i|\\theta_i]) = \\sigma_i^2 + \\text{Var}(\\theta_i) = \\sigma_i^2 + \\tau^2\n$$\nThis total variance for study $i$ incorporates both within-study sampling error ($\\sigma_i^2$) and between-study heterogeneity ($\\tau^2$). The goal is to estimate the overall mean effect $\\mu$.\n\nThe pooled estimator is $\\hat{\\mu} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i$. The unbiasedness constraint, $E[\\hat{\\mu}] = \\mu$, again requires $\\sum w_i = 1$. We must minimize the variance of $\\hat{\\mu}$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i y_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\text{Var}(y_i) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 (\\sigma_i^2 + \\tau^2)\n$$\nThe optimization problem is identical in form to the fixed-effect case, but the variance term is now $\\sigma_i^2 + \\tau^2$. Applying the same Lagrange multiplier method, we find that the optimal weights are proportional to the inverse of this total variance. In practice, the unknown $\\tau^2$ is replaced by its estimate, $\\hat{\\tau}^2$. The unnormalized random-effects weight for study $i$, denoted $w_{i,RE}$, is:\n$$\nw_{i,RE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_i^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2}\n$$\n\n### 3. Computation of Numerical Weights\n\nGiven data:\n- Within-study variances: $\\sigma^2 = (0.01, 0.04, 0.09, 0.16)$. Specifically, $\\sigma_1^2=0.01$, $\\sigma_2^2=0.04$, $\\sigma_3^2=0.09$, $\\sigma_4^2=0.16$.\n- Estimated between-study variance: $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = 0.05$.\n\n**Fixed-Effect Weights:**\n$$\nw_{1,FE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2} = \\frac{1}{0.01} = 100\n$$\n$$\nw_{2,FE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2} = \\frac{1}{0.04} = 25\n$$\n$$\nw_{3,FE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_3^2} = \\frac{1}{0.09} = \\frac{1}{9/100} = \\frac{100}{9}\n$$\n$$\nw_{4,FE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_4^2} = \\frac{1}{0.16} = \\frac{1}{16/100} = \\frac{100}{16} = \\frac{25}{4}\n$$\n\n**Random-Effects Weights:**\n$$\nw_{1,RE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_1^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} = \\frac{1}{0.01 + 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.06} = \\frac{1}{6/100} = \\frac{100}{6} = \\frac{50}{3}\n$$\n$$\nw_{2,RE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_2^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} = \\frac{1}{0.04 + 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.09} = \\frac{1}{9/100} = \\frac{100}{9}\n$$\n$$\nw_{3,RE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_3^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} = \\frac{1}{0.09 + 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.14} = \\frac{1}{14/100} = \\frac{100}{14} = \\frac{50}{7}\n$$\n$$\nw_{4,RE} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_4^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2} = \\frac{1}{0.16 + 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.21} = \\frac{1}{21/100} = \\frac{100}{21}\n$$\n\n### 4. Explanation of Weight Redistribution\n\nIn a fixed-effect meta-analysis, the weights $w_{i,FE} = 1/\\sigma_i^2$ are determined solely by the precision of each study. Studies with small sampling variance $\\sigma_i^2$ (typically large studies) receive substantially more weight than studies with large $\\sigma_i^2$.\n\nThe introduction of the between-study variance estimate $\\hat{\\tau}^2 > 0$ in the random-effects model fundamentally changes the weighting scheme. The presence of heterogeneity, as indicated by a non-zero $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ and a corresponding $I^2 > 0$, implies that the total variation in an observed effect $y_i$ is not just from sampling error ($\\sigma_i^2$) but also from true differences between the studies' underlying effects ($\\tau^2$). The random-effects model assumes each study is an estimate of a different true effect $\\theta_i$, and that these $\\theta_i$ are themselves samples from a super-population of effects.\n\nMathematically, the weight becomes $w_{i,RE} = 1/(\\sigma_i^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2)$. By adding a constant positive value $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ to each study's variance in the denominator, the total variances $(\\sigma_i^2 + \\hat{\\tau}^2)$ become more similar to each other than the original sampling variances $\\sigma_i^2$. This makes the random-effects weights more uniform than the fixed-effect weights. The ratio of weights between two studies $i$ and $j$ in the random-effects model is closer to $1$ than in the fixed-effect model.\n\nConsequently, influence is redistributed. The most precise studies (smallest $\\sigma_i^2$), which dominate the fixed-effect analysis, have their influence reduced. Conversely, the least precise studies (largest $\\sigma_i^2$) have their influence increased. The random-effects model effectively \"discounts\" the information from any single study, no matter how precise, because it is only one draw from the distribution of true effects. This redistribution results in a pooled estimate that is less dominated by a few large studies and gives more consideration to the full range of evidence. In a forest plot, where the size of the square for each study is often proportional to its weight, the squares become more equal in size when moving from a fixed-effect to a random-effects summary. The magnitude of this redistribution is directly related to the magnitude of heterogeneity: a larger $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ (and larger $I^2$) leads to a more pronounced evening-out of the weights.",

To maintain precision, calculations will be performed with exact fractions.\n\n- Study $1$: $\\hat{\\theta}_1=0.10$, $\\mathrm{SE}_1=0.05$. $v_1=(0.05)^2=0.0025=\\frac{1}{400}$. $w_1=400$. $w_1\\hat{\\theta}_1=40$. $w_1\\hat{\\theta}_1^2=4$.\n- Study $2$: $\\hat{\\theta}_2=0.12$, $\\mathrm{SE}_2=0.04$. $v_2=(0.04)^2=0.0016=\\frac{1}{625}$. $w_2=625$. $w_2\\hat{\\theta}_2=75$. $w_2\\hat{\\theta}_2^2=9$.\n- Study $3$: $\\hat{\\theta}_3=0.09$, $\\mathrm{SE}_3=0.06$. $v_3=(0.06)^2=0.0036=\\frac{9}{2500}$. $w_3=\\frac{2500}{9}$. $w_3\\hat{\\theta}_3=25$. $w_3\\hat{\\theta}_3^2=2.25=\\frac{9}{4}$.\n- Study $4$: $\\hat{\\theta}_4=0.15$, $\\mathrm{SE}_4=0.05$. $v_4=(0.05)^2=0.0025=\\frac{1}{400}$. $w_4=400$. $w_4\\hat{\\theta}_4=60$. $w_4\\hat{\\theta}_4^2=9$.\n- Study $5$: $\\hat{\\theta}_5=0.11$, $\\mathrm{SE}_5=0.05$. $v_5=(0.05)^2=0.0025=\\frac{1}{400}$. $w_5=400$. $w_5\\hat{\\theta}_5=44$. $w_5\\hat{\\theta}_5^2=4.84=\\frac{121}{25}$.\n- Study $6$: $\\hat{\\theta}_6=0.40$, $\\mathrm{SE}_6=0.07$. $v_6=(0.07)^2=0.0049=\\frac{49}{10000}$. $w_6=\\frac{10000}{49}$. $w_6\\hat{\\theta}_6=\\frac{4000}{49}$. $w_6\\hat{\\theta}_6^2=\\frac{1600}{49}$.\n\n**Part 1: Analysis of all $k=6$ studies**\n\nWe compute the required sums:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i = 400 + 625 + \\frac{2500}{9} + 400 + 400 + \\frac{10000}{49} = 1825 + \\frac{2500}{9} + \\frac{10000}{49} = \\frac{1825 \\cdot 441 + 2500 \\cdot 49 + 10000 \\cdot 9}{441} = \\frac{804825 + 122500 + 90000}{441} = \\frac{1017325}{441} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i = 40 + 75 + 25 + 60 + 44 + \\frac{4000}{49} = 244 + \\frac{4000}{49} = \\frac{244 \\cdot 49 + 4000}{49} = \\frac{11956 + 4000}{49} = \\frac{15956}{49} $$\nThe pooled estimate is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_{FE} = \\frac{\\sum w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i}{\\sum w_i} = \\frac{15956/49}{1017325/441} = \\frac{15956}{49} \\cdot \\frac{441}{1017325} = \\frac{15956 \\cdot 9}{1017325} = \\frac{143604}{1017325} \\approx 0.14116 $$\nTo compute $Q$, we need a third sum:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i^2 = 4 + 9 + \\frac{9}{4} + 9 + \\frac{121}{25} + \\frac{1600}{49} = 22 + \\frac{9}{4} + \\frac{121}{25} + \\frac{1600}{49} = \\frac{22 \\cdot 4900 + 9 \\cdot 1225 + 121 \\cdot 196 + 1600 \\cdot 100}{4900} = \\frac{107800 + 11025 + 23716 + 160000}{4900} = \\frac{302541}{4900} $$\nNow we compute $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\sum w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i)^2}{\\sum w_i} = \\frac{302541}{4900} - \\frac{(15956/49)^2}{1017325/441} = \\frac{302541}{4900} - \\frac{254593936/2401}{1017325/441} = \\frac{302541}{4900} - \\frac{9 \\cdot 254593936}{49 \\cdot 1017325} \\approx 61.74306 - 45.96484 \\approx 15.77822 $$\nThe degrees of freedom are $df = k-1 = 6-1=5$.\nThe $I^2$ statistic is:\n$$ I^2 = \\frac{Q - df}{Q} = \\frac{15.77822 - 5}{15.77822} = \\frac{10.77822}{15.77822} \\approx 0.68310 $$\nAn $I^2$ value of approximately $68\\%$ indicates substantial heterogeneity.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis after removing Study $6$ ($k=5$)**\n\nWe recompute the sums for the remaining $k=5$ studies.\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i\\right) - w_6 = \\frac{1017325}{441} - \\frac{10000}{49} = \\frac{1017325 - 90000}{441} = \\frac{927325}{441} = \\frac{18925}{9} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i\\right) - w_6 \\hat{\\theta}_6 = \\frac{15956}{49} - \\frac{4000}{49} = \\frac{11956}{49} = 244 $$\nThe new pooled estimate is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}'_{FE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i} = \\frac{244}{18925/9} = \\frac{244 \\cdot 9}{18925} = \\frac{2196}{18925} \\approx 0.11604 $$\nFor the new $Q$ statistic, $Q'$, we need the sum of squared terms:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i^2 = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^6 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i^2\\right) - w_6 \\hat{\\theta}_6^2 = \\frac{302541}{4900} - \\frac{1600}{49} = \\frac{302541 - 160000}{4900} = \\frac{142541}{4900} = \\frac{2909}{100} $$\nNow we compute $Q'$:\n$$ Q' = \\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i \\hat{\\theta}_i)^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^5 w_i} = \\frac{2909}{100} - \\frac{244^2}{18925/9} = \\frac{2909}{100} - \\frac{59536 \\cdot 9}{18925} = \\frac{2909}{100} - \\frac{535824}{18925} $$\nUsing a common denominator of $75700$:\n$$ Q' = \\frac{2909 \\cdot 757 - 535824 \\cdot 4}{75700} = \\frac{2202113 - 2143296}{75700} = \\frac{58817}{75700} \\approx 0.7770 $$\nThe degrees of freedom for this analysis are $df' = k-1 = 5-1=4$.\nWe compute the new $I^2$ statistic, $I'^2$:\n$$ I'^2 = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{Q' - df'}{Q'}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{58817/75700 - 4}{58817/75700}\\right) $$\nThe term inside the fraction is $Q' - df' \\approx 0.7770 - 4 = -3.223$. Since this value is negative, the ratio $(Q' - df')/Q'$ is also negative. Therefore, by its definition, the $I^2$ statistic is zero.\n$$ I'^2 = 0 $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe initial analysis of all six studies yielded a large and statistically significant heterogeneity ($Q \\approx 15.78$ on $5$ degrees of freedom), with an $I^2$ of approximately $68\\%$. This indicates that a substantial majority of the total variation in effect estimates is due to true heterogeneity rather than sampling error. The source of this heterogeneity is clearly Study $6$, with its much larger effect estimate ($\\hat{\\theta}_6=0.40$) compared to the others, which are clustered in the range $[0.09, 0.15]$.\n\nAfter removing Study $6$, the analysis of the remaining five studies shows a dramatic change. The new heterogeneity statistic $Q'$ is approximately $0.78$ on $4$ degrees of freedom. This value is much smaller than its expected value under the null hypothesis of homogeneity (which is $df'=4$). Consequently, the calculated $I^2$ value is $0$. This indicates that the observed variability among the first five studies is entirely consistent with what would be expected from sampling error alone. The removal of the single outlier study has resolved all evidence of heterogeneity, transforming the assessment from \"substantial\" to \"none\".",
