In a cohort of $n=48$ adults, the partial correlation between systolic blood pressure ($Y$) and urinary sodium ($X$) controlling for $p=5$ covariates (age, sex, Body Mass Index (BMI), smoking status, and physical activity) is estimated as $r=0.35$. Assume that the joint distribution of all variables is multivariate normal and that the usual linear model assumptions (independent observations, linearity, homoscedasticity) hold.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions, justify how the exact finite-sample null distribution for a test of $H_{0}: \\rho_{XY\\cdot Z}=0$ can be obtained by exploiting the equivalence between partial correlation and the significance test for a regression coefficient in a linear model that adjusts for the $p$ control variables. Then, using this exact null distribution, compute the two-sided p-value for the observed $r$.\n\nYour final answer should be a single decimal number corresponding to the two-sided p-value, rounded to $3$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The primary task is to justify the use of a t-test for a partial correlation coefficient by relating it to a test on a regression coefficient, and then to compute the corresponding p-value.\n\nLet $Y$ represent systolic blood pressure, $X$ represent urinary sodium, and $Z = (Z_1, Z_2, \\dots, Z_p)$ represent the vector of $p=5$ covariates. The partial correlation coefficient, $\\rho_{XY\\cdot Z}$, quantifies the linear association between $Y$ and $X$ after adjusting for the linear effects of the variables in $Z$. The null hypothesis to be tested is $H_0: \\rho_{XY\\cdot Z} = 0$.\n\nThe equivalence between partial correlation and multiple regression provides the justification for the exact null distribution. This equivalence arises because testing for a partial correlation is conceptually identical to testing for the significance of a predictor in a multiple linear regression model that includes the variables being controlled for.\n\nConsider the multiple linear regression model where $Y$ is predicted by $X$ and all the covariates in $Z$:\n$$\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_X X + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} \\beta_j Z_j + \\epsilon\n$$\nIn this model, the coefficient $\\beta_X$ represents the expected change in $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$, while holding all the covariates $Z_1, \\dots, Z_p$ constant. This is precisely the interpretation of the association between $Y$ and $X$ after controlling for $Z$. Therefore, testing the null hypothesis that there is no partial correlation between $Y$ and $X$ given $Z$ ($H_0: \\rho_{XY\\cdot Z} = 0$) is mathematically equivalent to testing the null hypothesis that the regression coefficient for $X$ is zero ($H_0: \\beta_X = 0$) in the specified multiple regression model.\n\nFor a multiple linear regression model, the significance of any individual coefficient $\\hat{\\beta}_k$ is tested using a t-test. The test statistic is given by:\n$$\nt = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_k - 0}{\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_k)}\n$$\nwhere $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_k)$ is the standard error of the estimated coefficient. Under the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_k=0$ and the standard assumptions of linear regression (which are given in the problem), this test statistic follows a Student's t-distribution.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for this t-distribution are given by $df = n - k - 1$, where $n$ is the sample size and $k$ is the total number of predictors in the model. In our model, we have $X$ as one predictor and the $p$ covariates in $Z$ as the other predictors. Thus, the total number of predictors is $k = 1 + p$. The number of parameters estimated in the model is $(1+p)$ slope coefficients plus one intercept, for a total of $p+2$ parameters. The degrees of freedom for the error term, and consequently for the t-test, are:\n$$\ndf = n - (1 + p) - 1 = n - p - 2\n$$\nIt can be shown that the t-statistic for testing $H_0: \\beta_X=0$ can be expressed directly in terms of the sample partial correlation coefficient, $r$ (which is an estimate of $\\rho_{XY\\cdot Z}$). The formula is:\n$$\nt = r \\sqrt{\\frac{n - p - 2}{1 - r^2}}\n$$\nThis formula provides the test statistic for $H_0: \\rho_{XY\\cdot Z}=0$, and its null distribution is a Student's t-distribution with $df = n - p - 2$ degrees of freedom.

The fourth moment is $\\text{E}[X^4] = 3$.\nGiven $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$, we have $\\text{E}[\\epsilon] = 0$ and $\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$.\nGiven $\\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)$, we have $\\text{E}[\\delta] = 0$ and $\\text{Var}(\\delta) = \\tau^2$.\n\nFor the predictor variable $Z_{\\tau} = X + \\delta$:\n$\\text{E}[Z_{\\tau}] = \\text{E}[X] + \\text{E}[\\delta] = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n$\\text{Var}(Z_{\\tau}) = \\text{Var}(X+\\delta) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(\\delta) = 1 + \\tau^2$ (due to independence of $X, \\delta$).\n\nFor the outcome variable $Y = X^2 + \\epsilon$:\n$\\text{E}[Y] = \\text{E}[X^2 + \\epsilon] = \\text{E}[X^2] + \\text{E}[\\epsilon] = 1 + 0 = 1$.\n\nNow we compute the covariances needed for the OLS coefficients:\n$\\text{Cov}(X, Z_{\\tau}) = \\text{Cov}(X, X+\\delta) = \\text{Cov}(X,X) + \\text{Cov}(X,\\delta) = \\text{Var}(X) + 0 = 1$.\n$\\text{Cov}(Y, Z_{\\tau}) = \\text{Cov}(X^2+\\epsilon, X+\\delta) = \\text{Cov}(X^2, X) + \\text{Cov}(X^2, \\delta) + \\text{Cov}(\\epsilon, X) + \\text{Cov}(\\epsilon, \\delta)$.\nDue to independence, $\\text{Cov}(X^2, \\delta)=0$, $\\text{Cov}(\\epsilon, X)=0$, and $\\text{Cov}(\\epsilon, \\delta)=0$.\n$\\text{Cov}(X^2, X) = \\text{E}[X^2 \\cdot X] - \\text{E}[X^2]\\text{E}[X] = \\text{E}[X^3] - (1)(0) = 0 - 0 = 0$.\nTherefore, $\\text{Cov}(Y, Z_{\\tau}) = 0$.\n\nNow we can find the OLS residuals.\nFor the regression of $X$ on $Z_{\\tau}$:\nThe slope is $\\beta_{X|Z_{\\tau}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Z_{\\tau})}{\\text{Var}(Z_{\\tau})} = \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}$.\nThe intercept is $\\beta_{0, X|Z_{\\tau}} = \\text{E}[X] - \\beta_{X|Z_{\\tau}} \\text{E}[Z_{\\tau}] = 0$.\nThe residual is $\\tilde{X}_{\\tau} = X - \\beta_{X|Z_{\\tau}}Z_{\\tau} = X - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}(X+\\delta) = \\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2}X - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}\\delta$.\n\nFor the regression of $Y$ on $Z_{\\tau}$:\nThe slope is $\\beta_{Y|Z_{\\tau}} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y,Z_{\\tau})}{\\text{Var}(Z_{\\tau})} = \\frac{0}{1+\\tau^2} = 0$.\nThe intercept is $\\beta_{0, Y|Z_{\\tau}} = \\text{E}[Y] - \\beta_{Y|Z_{\\tau}}\\text{E}[Z_{\\tau}] = 1 - 0 \\cdot 0 = 1$.\nThe OLS 'fit' is just the mean of $Y$.\nThe residual is $\\tilde{Y}_{\\tau} = Y - (\\beta_{0, Y|Z_{\\tau}} + \\beta_{Y|Z_{\\tau}}Z_{\\tau}) = Y - 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the covariance of the residuals, $\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{X}_{\\tau}, \\tilde{Y}_{\\tau})$.\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{X}_{\\tau}, \\tilde{Y}_{\\tau}) = \\text{Cov}\\left(\\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2}X - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}\\delta, Y-1\\right)\n$$\nSince $Y-1 = X^2+\\epsilon-1$, we have:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{X}_{\\tau}, \\tilde{Y}_{\\tau}) = \\text{Cov}\\left(\\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2}X - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}\\delta, X^2+\\epsilon-1\\right)\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of covariance and removing the constant $-1$:\n$$\n= \\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2}\\text{Cov}(X, X^2+\\epsilon) - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}\\text{Cov}(\\delta, X^2+\\epsilon)\n$$\nWe expand the covariance terms:\n$\\text{Cov}(X, X^2+\\epsilon) = \\text{Cov}(X,X^2) + \\text{Cov}(X,\\epsilon) = 0 + 0 = 0$.\n$\\text{Cov}(\\delta, X^2+\\epsilon) = \\text{Cov}(\\delta,X^2) + \\text{Cov}(\\delta,\\epsilon) = 0 + 0 = 0$ (due to mutual independence).\nThus, $\\text{Cov}(\\tilde{X}_{\\tau}, \\tilde{Y}_{\\tau}) = 0$ for any $\\tau^2 > 0$.\n\nSince the numerator of the partial correlation is zero, $\\rho_{XY \\cdot Z_{\\tau}} = 0$ for all $\\tau > 0$, provided the variances of the residuals are non-zero.\n$\\text{Var}(\\tilde{Y}_{\\tau}) = \\text{Var}(Y-1) = \\text{Var}(X^2+\\epsilon) = \\text{Var}(X^2)+\\text{Var}(\\epsilon) = (\\text{E}[X^4] - (\\text{E}[X^2])^2) + \\sigma^2 = (3 - 1^2) + \\sigma^2 = 2+\\sigma^2 > 0$.\n$\\text{Var}(\\tilde{X}_{\\tau}) = \\text{Var}(\\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2}X - \\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2}\\delta) = (\\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2})^2\\text{Var}(X) + (\\frac{1}{1+\\tau^2})^2\\text{Var}(\\delta) = \\frac{\\tau^4}{(1+\\tau^2)^2}(1) + \\frac{1}{(1+\\tau^2)^2}(\\tau^2) = \\frac{\\tau^4+\\tau^2}{(1+\\tau^2)^2} = \\frac{\\tau^2(1+\\tau^2)}{(1+\\tau^2)^2} = \\frac{\\tau^2}{1+\\tau^2} > 0$ for $\\tau > 0$.\nSince the variances are non-zero, the partial correlation is well-defined and equal to zero.\n\nFinally, we take the limit as $\\tau \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\rho_{XY \\cdot Z} = \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0} \\rho_{XY \\cdot Z_{\\tau}} = \\lim_{\\tau \\to 0} 0 = 0\n$$\n\nPart 2: Argument for Persistent Conditional Dependence\n\nThe result $\\rho_{XY \\cdot Z} = 0$ indicates that there is no *linear* association between $X$ and $Y$ after linearly adjusting for $Z=X$. However, partial correlation is not a general measure of conditional dependence. The equivalence between zero partial correlation and conditional independence ($\\rho_{AB \\cdot C}=0 \\iff A \\perp B | C$) holds only for variables that follow a multivariate normal distribution.\n\nIn this problem, the joint distribution of $(X,Y,Z)$ is not multivariate normal because the relationship $Y = X^2 + \\epsilon$ is nonlinear. Therefore, we cannot conclude conditional independence from the zero partial correlation.\n\nTo demonstrate the persistence of conditional dependence, we must examine the conditional distribution of one variable given the others. Let us analyze the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $Z=z$. Since $Z = X$, this is equivalent to examining the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$.\n\nThe data-generating model is $Y = X^2 + \\epsilon$. When we condition on a specific value $X=x$, the model becomes:\n$$\nY | (X=x) = x^2 + \\epsilon\n$$\nSince $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ is independent of $X$, the distribution of $Y$ conditional on $X=x$ is a normal distribution with mean $x^2$ and variance $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\nY | (X=x) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(x^2, \\sigma^2)\n$$\nThe conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X=x$ is:\n$$\n\\text{E}[Y | X=x] = x^2\n$$\nStatistical dependence between two variables $Y$ and $X$ is defined by the property that the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=x$ changes with $x$. A direct consequence is that if $\\text{E}[Y | X=x]$ is not a constant, the variables are dependent.\nIn this case, $\\text{E}[Y | X=x] = x^2$ is a non-constant function of $x$. For example, $\\text{E}[Y | X=1] = 1$ while $\\text{E}[Y | X=2] = 4$. This demonstrates that knowing the value of $X$ changes our expectation of the value of $Y$. This is the very definition of statistical dependence.\n\nIn conclusion, although the partial correlation $\\rho_{XY \\cdot Z}$ is zero, the variables $Y$ and $X$ (and therefore $Y$ and $Z$) are strongly dependent. The partial correlation method, being based on linear regressions, fails to detect the purely quadratic nature of the relationship. The conditional dependence between $Y$ and $X$ not only persists but is a defining feature of the data-generating mechanism.",
