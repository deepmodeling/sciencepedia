The test statistic for the null hypothesis $H_{0}: \\Delta = 0$ is the Z-statistic:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{(\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}) - 0}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_1} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_2}}} = \\frac{\\bar{X}_{1} - \\bar{X}_{2}}{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}}\n$$\nFor a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha$, the null hypothesis is rejected if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nPower ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_{0}$ when the true difference is $\\Delta \\neq 0$.

This value is compared to the specified Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of $5$ mmHg.\n\n**Clinical Relevance:** The MDE is the smallest true effect size that the study has a high probability ($80\\%$ power) of detecting as statistically significant. In this case, the MDE ($3.88$ mmHg) is less than the MCID ($5$ mmHg). This is a desirable feature for a clinical trial's design. It implies that the study is adequately powered to detect not only effects that are clinically important (i.e., $\\ge 5$ mmHg) but also effects that may be statistically significant yet fall short of clinical importance (e.g., a true effect of $4$ mmHg).\n\nThe primary benefit of having MDE $<$ MCID is that if the trial yields a non-significant result (i.e., fails to reject $H_{0}$), investigators can be reasonably confident that the true effect of the drug, if any, is likely less than $3.88$ mmHg. Since this value is already below the threshold for clinical importance, a null result from this study would provide strong evidence that the new drug does not offer a clinically meaningful advantage over the standard of care. The study is large enough to \"rule out\" a clinically important benefit, which is a valuable scientific conclusion.\n\n**Ethical Implications and the Role of the IRB:** The choice of sample size is a critical ethical issue in biostatistics, directly overseen by the Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB's mandate is to protect the rights and welfare of human research participants.\n\n$1$. **Protecting Participants from Futile Research:** An **underpowered** study, where the MDE would be much larger than the MCID (e.g., an MDE of $10$ mmHg for an MCID of $5$ mmHg), is unethical. Such a study would have a low probability of detecting a true, clinically important effect. It would thus expose participants to the risks, burdens, and inconvenience of research without a reasonable chance of producing scientifically valid and useful results. The IRB would reject such a protocol because it fails to satisfy the principle of beneficence (maximizing benefits and minimizing harms) and squanders participant contributions.\n\n$2$. **Ensuring Efficient Use of Resources:** Conversely, a grossly **overpowered** study (e.g., MDE = $1$ mmHg) might be seen as unethical because it enrolls more participants than necessary to answer the key clinical question. This exposes an unnecessary number of individuals to research-related risks and consumes finite resources (funding, time, patient populations) that could have been allocated to other pressing scientific questions.\n\n$3$. **The Role of the IRB and Biostatistical Justification:** The power calculation, leading to the MDE, is a cornerstone of the ethical justification for a proposed trial. Investigators must present this analysis to the IRB to demonstrate that the study design is scientifically sound and has been optimized. In this case, the sample size of $n=150$ per group leads to an MDE of $3.88$ mmHg, which is reasonably close to, and appropriately smaller than, the MCID of $5$ mmHg. This demonstrates a well-considered balance. It ensures the study is not futile (it can detect a clinically important effect with high probability) without being excessively large or wasteful. The biostatistical design thereby upholds the ethical principles of scientific validity and respect for persons by ensuring that participant involvement is meaningful and necessary.",

            "introduction": "While randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for causal inference, they are not always ethical or feasible to conduct. Consequently, much of our medical knowledge comes from observational studies, which are susceptible to unmeasured confounding. This exercise introduces the E-value, a modern sensitivity analysis tool that quantifies the strength of association an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and outcome to explain away an observed effect . Mastering this concept is an ethical imperative, equipping biostatisticians to responsibly communicate the robustness and residual uncertainty of findings from non-randomized data.",

            "problem": "A nonrandomized cohort study evaluates whether initiating a new antihypertensive drug within $30$ days of diagnosis is associated with one-year stroke incidence. Randomization was not feasible because withholding indicated therapy would be unethical under standard clinical practice. After adjustment for measured confounders (age, sex, baseline blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and socioeconomic status), the adjusted Risk Ratio (RR) for stroke comparing initiators versus non-initiators is $0.65$ with a $95\\%$ Confidence Interval (CI) of $\\left[0.50,\\,0.85\\right]$. The research team wishes to assess the robustness of this protective association to unmeasured confounding before making practice recommendations, in keeping with ethical obligations to avoid overstating effectiveness from observational data.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions and well-tested sensitivity analysis results for unmeasured confounding on the risk ratio scale, do the following without invoking any pre-memorized shortcut formulas.\n\n1) Starting from the definition of a bias factor due to an unmeasured confounder on the risk ratio scale and the requirement for “explaining away” an observed association, derive an analytic expression for the evidence value (E-value) corresponding to the confidence limit closest to the null when the point estimate indicates a protective effect. Clearly state any transformations you apply to handle protective versus harmful directions.\n\n2) Compute the exact E-value for the upper limit $0.85$ of the reported $95\\%$ CI.

Do not round.\n\n3) In one sentence, interpret what the magnitude of this E-value implies for the practical and ethical significance of translating these findings into clinical guidance, explicitly referencing the role of biostatistics in responsibly communicating residual uncertainty from unmeasured confounding.\n\nOnly the calculation in part $2$ will be graded numerically. Express the final answer for part $2$ as a simplified exact expression with no rounding and no units.",
            "solution": "This problem requires the derivation and application of the E-value, a sensitivity analysis parameter used to quantify the potential influence of an unmeasured confounder.\n\n**1) Derivation of the E-value Expression**\n\nLet $RR_{obs}$ be the observed risk ratio, adjusted for measured confounders. Let $RR_{true}$ be the true, causal risk ratio that would be observed in the absence of all confounding (measured and unmeasured). The relationship between them can be modeled as $RR_{obs} = RR_{true} \\times B$, where $B$ is the bias factor due to unmeasured confounding.\n\nThe task is to find the parameters of an unmeasured confounder $U$ that would be sufficient to \"explain away\" the observed association. Explaining away the association means reducing the true risk ratio to the null value, $RR_{true} = 1$. Substituting this into the equation gives $RR_{obs} = 1 \\times B$, or $B = RR_{obs}$.\n\nA foundational result in sensitivity analysis for a single, unmeasured, binary confounder $U$ provides an expression for the maximum bias factor $B$ it can produce. Let $RR_{EU}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the exposure $E$ and the confounder $U$. Let $RR_{UD}$ be the risk ratio for the association between the confounder $U$ and the outcome $D$, conditional on the exposure. The maximal bias factor is given by:\n$$ B = \\frac{RR_{EU} \\cdot RR_{UD}}{RR_{EU} + RR_{UD} - 1} $$\nThe E-value is defined as the minimum value that both $RR_{EU}$ and $RR_{UD}$ would need to take to explain away the observed association. To find this minimum common value, we set $RR_{EU} = RR_{UD} = E$, where $E$ represents the E-value. Substituting this into the bias formula:\n$$ B = \\frac{E \\cdot E}{E + E - 1} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nTo explain away the association, this bias factor must equal the observed risk ratio, $B = RR_{obs}$. We can therefore set up the equation:\n$$ RR_{obs} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\nThis derivation assumes $RR_{obs} > 1$. We rearrange this into a quadratic equation for $E$:\n$$ RR_{obs}(2E - 1) = E^2 $$\n$$ 2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\cdot E - RR_{obs} = E^2 $$\n$$ E^2 - (2 \\cdot RR_{obs}) \\cdot E + RR_{obs} = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ with $a=1$, $b = -2 \\cdot RR_{obs}$, and $c = RR_{obs}$:\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{(-2 \\cdot RR_{obs})^2 - 4(1)(RR_{obs})}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{4 \\cdot RR_{obs}^2 - 4 \\cdot RR_{obs}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\cdot RR_{obs} \\pm 2\\sqrt{RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)} $$\nSince the E-value is defined as a risk ratio, it must be greater than or equal to $1$. The larger root, $E = RR_{obs} + \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs}-1)}$, is taken as the solution as it represents the required strength of association.\n\nThe problem provides a protective risk ratio ($RR_{obs} < 1$). The derived formula requires its argument to be greater than $1$. To handle this, we perform a standard transformation by inverting the risk ratio to express it on the scale of harm. If the protective risk ratio is $r < 1$, its equivalent harmful counterpart is $r' = 1/r > 1$. We then apply the formula to $r'$.\n\nThe problem asks for the E-value corresponding to the confidence limit closest to the null value of $1$. For a protective effect with $RR < 1$ and a $CI = [lower, upper]$, the limit closest to the null is the upper limit, $RR_{CI-upper}$. Let this limit be denoted as $r_{lim}$. Since $r_{lim} < 1$ in this case, we use the transformed value $1/r_{lim}$ in our formula.\n\nThus, for a protective $RR$ limit $r_{lim}$, the analytic expression for the E-value is:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{1}{r_{lim}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r_{lim}}\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{lim}} - 1\\right)} $$\n\n**2) Computation of the E-value**\n\nWe are asked to compute the E-value for the upper $95\\%$ confidence limit, which is given as $0.85$.\nLet $r_{lim} = 0.85$. To compute an exact expression, we convert this decimal to a fraction:\n$$ r_{lim} = 0.85 = \\frac{85}{100} = \\frac{17}{20} $$\nThe transformed risk ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r_{lim}} = \\frac{1}{17/20} = \\frac{20}{17} $$\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived E-value formula:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{17}\\left(\\frac{20}{17} - 1\\right)} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{17}\\left(\\frac{20}{17} - \\frac{17}{17}\\right)} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\sqrt{\\frac{20}{17}\\left(\\frac{3}{17}\\right)} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\sqrt{\\frac{60}{17^2}} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\frac{\\sqrt{60}}{17} $$\nTo simplify the radical, we find the largest perfect square factor of $60$: $\\sqrt{60} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 15} = 2\\sqrt{15}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression:\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20}{17} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{15}}{17} $$\n$$ E\\text{-value} = \\frac{20 + 2\\sqrt{15}}{17} $$\nThis is the simplified exact expression for the E-value.\n\n**3) Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated E-value of $\\frac{20 + 2\\sqrt{15}}{17}$ (approximately $1.63$) for the confidence interval limit implies that an unmeasured confounder associated with both drug initiation and stroke by a risk ratio of at least $1.63$ each, above and beyond the measured confounders, could explain away the observed protective effect, thus highlighting the biostatistical and ethical imperative to communicate this non-trivial residual uncertainty before translating these observational findings into clinical guidance.",

            "introduction": "In many health studies, patients are at risk of multiple outcomes.

In a competing risks framework, an individual is at risk of several distinct events. The overall hazard of any event occurring at time $t$, denoted $\\lambda(t)$, is the sum of the cause-specific hazards. Given that the cause-specific hazards for the event of interest (cause $1$) and the competing event (cause $2$) are constant, $\\lambda_{1}(t) = \\lambda_{1}$ and $\\lambda_{2}(t) = \\lambda_{2}$, the overall hazard is also constant:\n$$ \\lambda(t) = \\lambda_{1}(t) + \\lambda_{2}(t) = \\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2} $$\nThe overall survival function, $S(t)$, is the probability that an individual has not experienced *any* event by time $t$.

It is defined by integrating the cause-specific hazard rate for event $k$ over time, weighted by the probability of being event-free up to that time:\n$$ F_{k}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} S(u)\\,\\lambda_{k}(u)\\,du $$\nFor the event of interest (cause $1$), with constant hazard $\\lambda_{1}$, the CIF is:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})u) \\, \\lambda_{1} \\, du $$\nSince $\\lambda_{1}$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\lambda_{1} \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})u) \\, du $$\nThe integral of the exponential function is straightforward:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\lambda_{1} \\left[ \\frac{-\\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})u)}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration ($t$ and $0$):\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\frac{-\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) - \\exp(0) \\right) $$\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\frac{-\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) - 1 \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the true cumulative incidence of cause $1$:\n$$ F_{1}(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_{1}}{\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2}} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1} + \\lambda_{2})t) \\right) $$\nThis quantity is often referred to as the \"crude\" probability of the event.\n\n### Task 2: Derivation of the \"Naive\" Risk Estimate ($F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t)$)\n\nWhen the competing event (cause $2$) is incorrectly treated as non-informative censoring, the Kaplan-Meier (KM) estimator is used. The KM method estimates the survival function for the event of interest *as if it were the only event possible*. It estimates the survival function in a hypothetical scenario where the competing risk is eliminated without altering the hazard of the primary event.\n\nIn this naive framework, the only hazard considered is $\\lambda_{1}$. The survival function estimated by the KM method, which we can denote $S_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t)$, would correspond to a world with only this hazard:\n$$ S_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda_{1}(u)\\,du\\right) $$\nGiven the constant hazard $\\lambda_{1}$:\n$$ S_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{1}t) $$\nThe naive risk estimate, $F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t)$, is then calculated as $1$ minus this survival probability. This represents the cumulative probability of failure from cause $1$ in the absence of any competing causes.\n$$ F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t) = 1 - S_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{1}t) $$\nThis quantity is often referred to as the \"net\" probability of the event and is known to be a biased (overestimated) representation of the true risk in the presence of competing events.\n\n### Task 3: Calculation of the Bias ($B$)\n\nThe bias is defined as the difference between the naive estimate and the true estimate at the decision horizon $t^{\\star} = 3\\ \\text{years}$. The given parameters are $\\lambda_{1} = 0.08\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = 0.12\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the true cumulative incidence $F_{1}(t^{\\star})$:\nThe sum of hazards is $\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = 0.08 + 0.12 = 0.20\\ \\text{year}^{-1}$.\n$$ F_{1}(3) = \\frac{0.08}{0.20} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(0.20)(3)) \\right) $$\n$$ F_{1}(3) = 0.4 \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.6) \\right) $$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.6) \\approx 0.5488116$:\n$$ F_{1}(3) \\approx 0.4 \\times (1 - 0.5488116) = 0.4 \\times 0.4511884 = 0.18047536 $$\n\nNext, we compute the naive risk estimate $F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t^{\\star})$:\n$$ F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(3) = 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{1})(t^{\\star})) = 1 - \\exp(-(0.08)(3)) $$\n$$ F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(3) = 1 - \\exp(-0.24) $$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-0.24) \\approx 0.78662786$:\n$$ F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(3) \\approx 1 - 0.78662786 = 0.21337214 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the bias $B = F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(t^{\\star}) - F_{1}(t^{\\star})$:\n$$ B = 0.21337214 - 0.18047536 = 0.03289678 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ B \\approx 0.03290 $$\n\n### Task 4: Explanation of Clinical and Ethical Implications\n\nThe hospital's current policy is to initiate treatment if the estimated $3$-year risk of the adverse event exceeds the threshold of $0.20$.\n\n1.  **Correct Analysis (Competing Risks Model)**: The true $3$-year risk is $F_{1}(3) \\approx 0.1805$. Since $0.1805 < 0.20$, a decision based on this correct analysis would be to **not** administer the prophylactic therapy.\n\n2.  **Incorrect Analysis (Naive Kaplan-Meier)**: The naive risk estimate, obtained by improperly treating death as non-informative censoring, is $F_{1}^{\\text{KM}}(3) \\approx 0.2134$. Since $0.2134 > 0.20$, a decision based on this flawed analysis would be to **administer** the therapy.\n\nThe choice of statistical methodology directly alters the clinical decision. The consultant's warning is substantiated: the naive method inflates the risk estimate, pushing it across the decision threshold.\n\nThis raises a significant **ethical concern**: **over-treatment**. By using an inappropriate statistical model, clinicians would subject patients to a therapy that, according to a more accurate model of reality, they do not qualify for. This violates the fundamental ethical principle of **non-maleficence** (\"first, do no harm\"), as patients are exposed to the potential side effects, financial costs, and personal burden of a treatment without a sufficient probability of benefit to justify those risks. Furthermore, providing patients with an inflated risk estimate (e.g., a $21.3\\%$ risk instead of an $18.1\\%$ risk) compromises the process of **informed consent**, as their decision is based on inaccurate information. From a public health perspective, this misapplication of statistics leads to a misallocation of healthcare resources, an issue of **distributive justice**.",
