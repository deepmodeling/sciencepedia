            "problem": "A diploid mammalian germline genome contains $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs. In a single generation, suppose each base independently experiences a point mutation with probability $p = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$. Let $X$ denote the total number of mutated bases in that generation. The exact distribution of $X$ is binomial under the assumptions stated, and, by the law of rare events, a Poisson approximation with mean $\\lambda = n p$ is often used for calculations when the genome is large and $p$ is small.\n\nStarting from the foundational definitions of independent Bernoulli trials, the binomial count, and the total variation distance between two probability distributions, use the principle underlying the law of rare events to justify a Poisson approximation to $X$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The values for genome size and mutation rate are realistic, and the application of the binomial and Poisson distributions to model mutation counts is a standard and fundamental technique in biostatistics and population genetics. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three parts: first, a justification of the Poisson approximation to the binomial distribution starting from foundational principles; second, the use of a specific inequality to bound the approximation error; and third, the numerical evaluation of this bound.\n\n**1. Justification of the Poisson Approximation (Law of Rare Events)**\n\nLet $n$ be the number of independent trials, and $p$ be the probability of success for each trial. In this context, a \"trial\" is the potential mutation of a single base pair, so $n = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$. A \"success\" is a mutation event, with probability $p = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$. The total number of mutations, $X$, is the sum of the outcomes of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nThe exact distribution of $X$ is the binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n, p)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for observing exactly $k$ mutations is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nThe Poisson approximation is valid in the limit where $n \\to \\infty$ and $p \\to 0$ such that their product, $\\lambda = np$, remains constant and finite. We can demonstrate this by taking the limit of the binomial PMF. Let's substitute $p = \\lambda/n$ into the expression:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^k \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{n-k}$$\nWe can rewrite the factorial term and rearrange the expression:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!} \\frac{\\lambda^k}{n^k} \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{-k}$$\nCollecting terms, we get:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} \\left[\\frac{n(n-1)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{n^k}\\right] \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^n \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{-k}$$\nNow, we analyze the behavior of each part as $n \\to \\infty$ for a fixed $k$:\n- The term $\\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!}$ is constant with respect to $n$.\n- The term in brackets can be expanded as:\n$$\\frac{n}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-1}{n} \\cdot \\frac{n-2}{n} \\cdots \\frac{n-k+1}{n} = 1 \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\cdot \\left(1-\\frac{2}{n}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{n}\\right)$$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, each term in this product approaches $1$, so the entire product approaches $1$.\n- The term $\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^n$ is a standard limit definition for the exponential function:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^n = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n- The term $\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{-k}$ approaches $(1-0)^{-k} = 1$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nCombining these results, we find the limiting PMF:\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThis is the PMF of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$. This derivation justifies using the Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda = np$ as an approximation for the binomial distribution when $n$ is large and $p$ is small.\n\n**2. Bounding the Approximation Error**\n\nThe quality of the approximation can be quantified using the total variation distance, $d_{TV}$, between the exact binomial probability distribution ($P_{Bin}$) and the approximating Poisson distribution ($P_{Po}$). For two discrete probability distributions $P_1$ and $P_2$ on a countable set $\\Omega$, the total variation distance is defined as:\n$$d_{TV}(P_1, P_2) = \\sup_{A \\subseteq \\Omega} |P_1(A) - P_2(A)|$$\nThis value represents the largest possible absolute difference between the probabilities of any single event $A$ under the two distributions. It thus provides the upper bound on the error requested in the problem.\n\nFor the approximation of a sum of independent Bernoulli trials by a Poisson distribution, a powerful result (often derived using the Chen-Stein method or from Le Cam's theorem) provides a quantitative bound on this distance. Let $I_1, I_2, \\ldots, I_n$ be independent Bernoulli random variables with $P(I_i=1) = p_i$. Let $W = \\sum_{i=1}^n I_i$ and $\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i$. The total variation distance between the distribution of $W$ and a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ is bounded by:\n$$d_{TV}(\\mathcal{L}(W), \\text{Po}(\\lambda)) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2$$\nThe problem asks to specialize this to the case where all trials have the same probability, i.e., $p_i = p$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$. In this case, the sum of Bernoulli trials $W$ is a binomial random variable $X \\sim \\text{Bin}(n,p)$, and the sum in the bound simplifies to:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n p^2 = np^2$$\nThus, the specific inequality for our problem is:\n$$d_{TV}(\\text{Bin}(n,p), \\text{Po}(np)) \\le np^2$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation of the Bound**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Number of trials (base pairs), $n = 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$\n- Probability of success (mutation), $p = 1.2 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\nWe now substitute these values into the inequality's bound:\n$$\\text{Error Bound} = np^2 = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (1.2 \\times 10^{-8})^2$$\nFirst, calculate $p^2$:\n$$p^2 = (1.2 \\times 10^{-8})^2 = (1.2)^2 \\times (10^{-8})^2 = 1.44 \\times 10^{-16}$$\nNow, multiply by $n$:\n$$\\text{Error Bound} = (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (1.44 \\times 10^{-16})$$\n$$\\text{Error Bound} = (3.2 \\times 1.44) \\times (10^{9} \\times 10^{-16})$$\n$$\\text{Error Bound} = 4.608 \\times 10^{9-16}$$\n$$\\text{Error Bound} = 4.608 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThis value is an upper bound on the absolute difference between the true binomial probability and the Poisson approximation for any event concerning the number of mutations $X$. For example, the error in calculating $P(X \\le 50)$ is guaranteed to be no more than $4.608 \\times 10^{-7}$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $4.608 \\times 10^{-7}$ already has exactly four significant figures (4, 6, 0, 8). In standard decimal form, this is $0.0000004608$.",

The terminology is precise and objective, and the task is a standard, non-trivial exercise in statistical theory and application. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Score Equations\n\nThe first task is to construct the score equations for the parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)$. The score equations are obtained by setting the first partial derivatives of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameters to zero.\n\nLet $Y_i$ be the observed count for unit $i$, which is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_i$, i.e., $Y_i \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_i)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for a single observation $Y_i=y_i$ is:\n$$\nP(Y_i = y_i | \\mu_i) = \\frac{\\mu_i^{y_i} \\exp(-\\mu_i)}{y_i!}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood for a single observation, $\\ell_i$, is the natural logarithm of the PMF:\n$$\n\\ell_i(\\mu_i | y_i) = \\log\\left( P(Y_i = y_i | \\mu_i) \\right) = y_i \\log(\\mu_i) - \\mu_i - \\log(y_i!)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a GLM with a log link function and an offset term for exposure $E_i$. The linear predictor is $\\eta_i = \\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\beta x_i$. The link function connects the mean $\\mu_i$ to the linear predictor:\n$$\n\\log(\\mu_i) = \\eta_i = \\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\beta x_i\n$$\nFrom this, we can express $\\mu_i$ as:\n$$\n\\mu_i = \\exp(\\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\beta x_i) = E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\log(\\mu_i)$ and $\\mu_i$ into the expression for $\\ell_i$, we obtain the log-likelihood for observation $i$ in terms of the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\ell_i(\\alpha, \\beta) = y_i (\\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\beta x_i) - E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) - \\log(y_i!)\n$$\nAssuming the $n$ observations are independent, the total log-likelihood $L(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is the sum of the individual log-likelihoods:\n$$\nL(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ell_i(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i (\\log(E_i) + \\alpha + \\beta x_i) - E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) - \\log(y_i!) \\right]\n$$\nThe score vector consists of the partial derivatives of $L(\\alpha, \\beta)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\alpha} \\left[ y_i \\alpha - E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i - E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right]\n$$\nRecalling that $\\mu_i = E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i)$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\alpha} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\mu_i)\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $\\beta$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta} \\left[ y_i \\beta x_i - E_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ y_i x_i - E_i x_i \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta x_i) \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\beta} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i (y_i - \\mu_i)\n$$\nThe score equations are found by setting these partial derivatives to zero.

Derivation of Closed-Form MLEs\n\nThe second task is to find closed-form expressions for $\\widehat{\\alpha}$ and $\\widehat{\\beta}$ for the specific case where $x_i$ is a binary predictor, $x_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.

Notice that the second part of the first equation, $\\sum_{i \\in I_1} (Y_i - E_i \\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha} + \\widehat{\\beta}))$, is exactly what the second score equation sets to zero. Thus, the first equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in I_0} (Y_i - E_i \\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha})) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha})$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in I_0} Y_i = \\sum_{i \\in I_0} E_i \\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha}) = \\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha}) \\sum_{i \\in I_0} E_i\n$$\n$$\n\\implies \\exp(\\widehat{\\alpha}) = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in I_0} Y_i}{\\sum_{i \\in I_0} E_i}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both expressions provides the closed-form MLEs.

There are no contradictions in the given information.\n5.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The parameter values are plausible for a biological study and are mathematically consistent.\n6.  **Trivial or Tautological:** The problem is non-trivial. It requires the correct application of the law of total expectation and the law of total variance to two different, nuanced stochastic models and an understanding of the sources of variance in each.\n7.  **No other flaws identified.**\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed with the derivation and option analysis.\n\n### Derivations from First Principles\n\n**Hypothesis 1: Compound Poisson Sum ($S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i$)**\n\nThe problem requires deriving $E(S)$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(S)$ using the laws of total expectation and variance.\n\n**1. Mean of S, $E(S)$:**\nUsing the law of total expectation: $E(S) = E[E(S \\mid N)]$.\nFirst, we find the conditional expectation of $S$ given $N=n$:\n$E(S \\mid N=n) = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\mid N=n\\right]$.\nSince the $Y_i$ are independent of $N$, this simplifies to $E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right]$.\nBy linearity of expectation and because the $Y_i$ are identically distributed, we have:\n$E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E(Y_i) = n E(Y)$.\nSo, the random variable $E(S \\mid N)$ is $N E(Y)$.\nNow, we take the expectation over $N$:\n$E(S) = E[N E(Y)] = E(N) E(Y)$.\nSince $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, its mean is $E(N) = \\lambda$.\nTherefore, $E(S) = \\lambda E(Y)$.\n\n**2. Variance of S, $\\operatorname{Var}(S)$:**\nUsing the law of total variance: $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = E[\\operatorname{Var}(S \\mid N)] + \\operatorname{Var}[E(S \\mid N)]$.\nWe evaluate each term:\n-   **First term: $E[\\operatorname{Var}(S \\mid N)]$**\n    We need the conditional variance of $S$ given $N=n$:\n    $\\operatorname{Var}(S \\mid N=n) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i \\mid N=n\\right]$.\n    Since $Y_i$ are independent of $N$ and are i.i.d., the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n    $\\operatorname{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\operatorname{Var}(Y_i) = n \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\n    So, the random variable $\\operatorname{Var}(S \\mid N)$ is $N \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\n    Taking the expectation over $N$: $E[N \\operatorname{Var}(Y)] = E(N) \\operatorname{Var}(Y) = \\lambda \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$.\n-   **Second term: $\\operatorname{Var}[E(S \\mid N)]$**\n    From the mean calculation, we know $E(S \\mid N) = N E(Y)$.\n    We need the variance of this random variable:\n    $\\operatorname{Var}[N E(Y)] = [E(Y)]^2 \\operatorname{Var}(N)$.\n    Since $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, its variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(N) = \\lambda$.\n    So, $\\operatorname{Var}[E(S \\mid N)] = [E(Y)]^2 \\lambda$.\nCombining the two terms:\n$\\operatorname{Var}(S) = \\lambda \\operatorname{Var(Y)} + \\lambda [E(Y)]^2 = \\lambda (\\operatorname{Var}(Y) + [E(Y)]^2)$.\n\n**Hypothesis 2: Mixed Poisson Count ($N$)**\n\nThe problem requires deriving $E(N)$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(N)$ using the laws of total expectation and variance.\n\n**1. Mean of N, $E(N)$:**\nUsing the law of total expectation: $E(N) = E[E(N \\mid \\Lambda)]$.\nFor a Poisson distribution with rate $\\Lambda$, the conditional mean is $E(N \\mid \\Lambda) = \\Lambda$.\nTaking the expectation over the distribution of $\\Lambda$:\n$E(N) = E[\\Lambda]$.\nThe problem defines $E(\\Lambda) = \\mu$. So, $E(N) = \\mu$.\n\n**2. Variance of N, $\\operatorname{Var}(N)$:**\nUsing the law of total variance: $\\operatorname{Var}(N) = E[\\operatorname{Var}(N \\mid \\Lambda)] + \\operatorname{Var}[E(N \\mid \\Lambda)]$.\nWe evaluate each term:\n-   **First term: $E[\\operatorname{Var}(N \\mid \\Lambda)]$**\n    For a Poisson distribution with rate $\\Lambda$, the conditional variance is equal to the mean: $\\operatorname{Var}(N \\mid \\Lambda) = \\Lambda$.\n    Taking the expectation over the distribution of $\\Lambda$: $E[\\Lambda] = \\mu$.\n-   **Second term: $\\operatorname{Var}[E(N \\mid \\Lambda)]$**\n    From the mean calculation, we know $E(N \\mid \\Lambda) = \\Lambda$.\n    The variance of this random variable is simply $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Lambda)$.\n    The problem defines $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Lambda) = \\sigma^2$.\nCombining the two terms:\n$\\operatorname{Var}(N) = \\mu + \\sigma^2$.\n\n### Numerical Calculations and Option Analysis\n\n**Applying values for Hypothesis 1:**\n$\\lambda = 5$, $E(Y) = 3$, $\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = 2$.\n$E(S) = \\lambda E(Y) = 5 \\times 3 = 15$.\n$\\operatorname{Var}(S) = \\lambda (\\operatorname{Var}(Y) + [E(Y)]^2) = 5 \\times (2 + 3^2) = 5 \\times (2+9) = 5 \\times 11 = 55$.\n\n**Applying values for Hypothesis 2:**\n$\\mu = 15$, $\\sigma^2 = 40$.\n$E(N) = \\mu = 15$.\n$\\operatorname{Var}(N) = \\mu + \\sigma^2 = 15 + 40 = 55$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Under Hypothesis $1$ with $\\lambda = 5$, $E(S) = 15$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = 55$, and the excess variance beyond the mean reflects randomness in event sizes $Y$ in addition to the Poisson counting variation.**\nOur calculations confirm $E(S) = 15$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = 55$. The variance is greater than the mean ($55  15$), a condition known as overdispersion. The variance formula $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = \\lambda \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + \\lambda [E(Y)]^2$ shows two sources of variation. The term $\\lambda [E(Y)]^2$ can be interpreted as variance arising from the random number of events ($N$), scaled by the squared mean event size. The term $\\lambda \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$ is variance arising from the variability of event sizes themselves. The statement correctly identifies that the total variance, and thus the overdispersion, is due to randomness in $Y$ (both its mean being greater than $1$ and its own variance) acting on top of the fundamental randomness of the Poisson event counter $N$. The statement is an accurate qualitative description.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under Hypothesis $2$ with $E(\\Lambda) = 15$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(\\Lambda) = 40$, $E(N) = 15$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(N) = 55$, and the excess variance beyond the mean reflects heterogeneity in the arrival rate $\\Lambda$ across hosts.**\nOur calculations confirm $E(N) = 15$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(N) = 55$. The excess variance (or overdispersion) is $\\operatorname{Var}(N) - E(N) = 55 - 15 = 40$. Our derived formula for variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(N) = E(\\Lambda) + \\operatorname{Var}(\\Lambda)$. Thus, the overdispersion is $\\operatorname{Var}(N) - E(N) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\Lambda) = \\sigma^2$. The value given for $\\sigma^2$ is $40$. The statement that the excess variance reflects heterogeneity in the arrival rate $\\Lambda$ is precisely correct; the overdispersion is mathematically identical to the variance of the rate parameter $\\Lambda$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Because Hypotheses $1$ and $2$ yield the same mean and variance in this numerical example, they necessarily imply the same full distribution for counts and are therefore mechanistically indistinguishable from any dataset.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A probability distribution is not uniquely defined by its first two moments (mean and variance). While some specific choices of sub-distributions (e.g., a Logarithmic series for $Y$ in H1 and a Gamma for $\\Lambda$ in H2) can both lead to a Negative Binomial distribution, this is not a general rule. In general, the full distributions will be different. For example, we can compare the probability of observing a zero count.\n- Under H1: $P(S=0) = P(N=0) = e^{-\\lambda} = e^{-5} \\approx 0.0067$.\n- Under H2: $P(N=0) = E[P(N=0 \\mid \\Lambda)] = E[e^{-\\Lambda}]$. By Jensen's inequality, for the convex function $f(x)=e^{-x}$, we have $E[e^{-\\Lambda}] \\ge e^{-E[\\Lambda]} = e^{-15}$. The inequality is strict if $\\Lambda$ is not a constant.\nThe probabilities of zero counts are different ($e^{-5} \\neq E[e^{-\\Lambda}]$), so the distributions are not the same. Therefore, the models are, in principle, distinguishable with sufficient data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If event size were deterministic with $Y \\equiv 1$ in Hypothesis $1$, then $S$ would have variance equal to its mean ($\\operatorname{Var}(S) = E(S)$), eliminating overdispersion unless rate heterogeneity is introduced.**\nIf $Y_i \\equiv 1$ for all $i$, then $E(Y)=1$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(Y)=0$. The total burden $S$ becomes $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 1 = N$. Since $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, it follows that $S \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$. For a Poisson distribution, the mean is $E(S) = \\lambda$ and the variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = \\lambda$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = E(S)$. This property is called equidispersion. Overdispersion ($\\operatorname{Var}(S)  E(S)$) is indeed eliminated. To re-introduce overdispersion, a different mechanism would be needed, such as the rate heterogeneity described in Hypothesis 2. The statement is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. In Hypothesis $1$ with $N \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ and independent i.i.d. event sizes $Y$, the variance of $S$ is simply $\\lambda \\operatorname{Var}(Y)$; any contribution involving $[E(Y)]^2$ occurs only in mixtures of Poisson rates.**\nThis statement is false. As derived from first principles, the variance under Hypothesis 1 is $\\operatorname{Var}(S) = \\lambda \\operatorname{Var}(Y) + \\lambda [E(Y)]^2$. The statement incorrectly omits the second term, $\\lambda [E(Y)]^2$. This term arises directly from the compound Poisson model structure, specifically from the variance of the conditional expectation, $\\operatorname{Var}[E(S \\mid N)]$. The claim that such a term only occurs in mixtures of Poisson rates is also false; this model is a compounding model, not a mixture model in the sense of Hypothesis 2.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
