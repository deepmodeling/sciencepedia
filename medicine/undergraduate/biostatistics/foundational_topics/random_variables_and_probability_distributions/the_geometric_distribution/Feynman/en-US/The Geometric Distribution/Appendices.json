            "introduction": "The geometric distribution is fundamental for modeling the 'waiting time' for a first success in a series of trials. This first exercise grounds our understanding by connecting an observable average—the expected number of attempts—directly to the distribution's core parameter, the probability of success $p$. By working backward from the expected value, you'll practice a key skill in statistical inference: deducing the properties of a process from its outcomes. ",

            "problem": "A quality control engineer at a semiconductor manufacturing plant is tasked with inspecting newly produced microchips. The procedure involves selecting chips one by one from a very large production batch and testing them sequentially until the first defective chip is found. The detection of a defect in one chip is statistically independent of the status of any other chip. Based on historical data from the manufacturing process, the expected number of chips the engineer needs to test to find the first defective one is exactly 4.\n\nWhat is the probability that any single, randomly selected microchip is defective? Express your answer as a decimal or a simple fraction.",
            "solution": "We model the testing as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials with constant probability of defect. Let $p$ be the probability that any single chip is defective, and let $N$ be the trial on which the first defective chip is found. Then $N$ follows a geometric distribution on $\\{1,2,\\dots\\}$ with parameter $p$, for which\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(N=n)=(1-p)^{n-1}p \\quad \\text{for } n\\in\\{1,2,\\dots\\}.\n$$\nThe expected value is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N]=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n\\,\\mathbb{P}(N=n)=\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n(1-p)^{\\,n-1}p.\n$$\nUsing the standard series identity for $|r|1$,\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} n r^{\\,n-1}=\\frac{1}{(1-r)^{2}},\n$$\nwith $r=1-p$, we obtain\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N]=p\\cdot \\frac{1}{\\bigl(1-(1-p)\\bigr)^{2}}=p\\cdot \\frac{1}{p^{2}}=\\frac{1}{p}.\n$$\nGiven $\\mathbb{E}[N]=4$, we solve\n$$\n\\frac{1}{p}=4 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad p=\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThus, the probability that a randomly selected chip is defective is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (equivalently, $0.25$).",

            "introduction": "A unique and powerful feature of the geometric distribution is its 'memoryless' property, which implies that the past has no bearing on the future probability of waiting. This exercise challenges you to explore this concept through conditional probability, calculating the likelihood of a future success given that it hasn't happened yet. Mastering this idea is key to understanding why the geometric distribution is a cornerstone in modeling phenomena like reliability and queuing theory. ",

            "problem": "Consider a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial results in either a \"success\" or a \"failure\". The probability of a success on any given trial is a constant, denoted by $p$, where $0  p  1$. The probability of a failure is therefore $(1-p)$.\n\nLet the random variable $K$ represent the trial number on which the first success occurs. The probability distribution of $K$ is known as the geometric distribution, with the probability mass function given by:\n$$\nP(K=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p \\quad \\text{for } k = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThis formula represents the probability that the first $k-1$ trials are failures and the $k$-th trial is a success.\n\nDerive the probability that the first success occurs on the fifth trial, given that it did not occur in the first two trials.

            "introduction": "Real-world processes often involve more complexity than a single, constant probability. This advanced problem models a scenario with alternating success probabilities, a common situation in fields like communications engineering or clinical trials.

            "problem": "In a data network, a critical data packet must be transmitted across a noisy channel. Two different transmission protocols, Protocol Alpha and Protocol Beta, are available. The system attempts to send the packet by alternating between these two protocols. The process begins with an attempt using Protocol Alpha. If this attempt fails, the system tries Protocol Beta. If Beta fails, it reverts to Alpha, and this alternating sequence of attempts continues until the packet is successfully transmitted.\n\nAssume that for any single attempt, the probability of a successful transmission is $p_A$ for Protocol Alpha and $p_B$ for Protocol Beta. The outcome of each attempt is independent of all other attempts.\n\nFind a closed-form analytic expression for the expected total number of attempts required until the packet is successfully transmitted. Your expression should be in terms of $p_A$ and $p_B$.",
