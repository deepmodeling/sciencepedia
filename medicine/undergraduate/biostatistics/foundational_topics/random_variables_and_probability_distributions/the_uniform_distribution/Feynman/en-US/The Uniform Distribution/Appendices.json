            "introduction": "The cornerstone of understanding any probability distribution is learning how to calculate probabilities from its probability density function (PDF). This first exercise focuses on the most fundamental property of the uniform distribution. By applying the definition of the PDF, you will see how the probability of a random variable falling within a specific range corresponds directly to the ratio of the sub-interval's length to the total interval's length, reinforcing the distribution's intuitive, geometric nature .",

This practice problem elevates our analysis from a single random variable to two independent ones. You will explore how to determine the probability of one event occurring before another by visualizing their joint distribution in a two-dimensional space and calculating the area of the region of interest .

            "problem": "In the field of signal processing, the characterization of noise is a fundamental task. Consider a system where the total noise is the superposition of two independent noise sources. Let the contribution from the first source be represented by a random variable $X$, and the contribution from the second source by a random variable $Y$. Both $X$ and $Y$ are normalized and found to be independently and uniformly distributed over the interval $[0, 1]$. An analyst is studying the composite noise signal, a new random variable $Z$ defined as the sum of the individual contributions, $Z = X + Y$.\n\nCalculate the value of the probability density function for the composite noise, $f_Z(z)$, evaluated at $z = 1.4$.",
            "solution": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be two independent random variables, both uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1]$. Their probability density functions (PDFs) are given by:\n$$f_X(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n$$f_Y(y) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } 0 \\le y \\le 1 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe random variable $Z$ is defined as the sum $Z = X + Y$. The PDF of the sum of two independent continuous random variables is given by the convolution of their individual PDFs. The convolution integral is:\n$$f_Z(z) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_X(x) f_Y(z-x) \\, dx$$\n\nThe integrand $f_X(x) f_Y(z-x)$ is non-zero only when both $f_X(x)$ and $f_Y(z-x)$ are non-zero. This requires two conditions to be met simultaneously:\n1.  $0 \\le x \\le 1$ (from the definition of $f_X(x)$)\n2.  $0 \\le z-x \\le 1$ (from the definition of $f_Y(z-x)$)\n\nThe second condition can be rewritten in terms of $x$ as $z-1 \\le x \\le z$.\nFor the integral to be non-zero, the variable of integration $x$ must satisfy both conditions:\n$$0 \\le x \\le 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad z-1 \\le x \\le z$$\nThis means we need to find the intersection of the interval $[0, 1]$ and the interval $[z-1, z]$. The nature of this intersection depends on the value of $z$. We also note that since $X$ and $Y$ are non-negative, their sum $Z$ must be non-negative. Since their maximum values are 1, the maximum value of $Z$ is 2. So, $f_Z(z) = 0$ for $z < 0$ or $z > 2$. We only need to consider $z \\in [0, 2]$.\n\nWe analyze the problem in two cases based on the value of $z$.\n\n**Case 1: $0 \\le z < 1$**\nIn this case, the interval for $x$ is the intersection of $[0, 1]$ and $[z-1, z]$. Since $z < 1$, we have $z-1 < 0$. The intersection is thus $[\\max(0, z-1), \\min(1, z)] = [0, z]$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$f_Z(z) = \\int_{0}^{z} (1)(1) \\, dx = [x]_{0}^{z} = z$$\n\n**Case 2: $1 \\le z \\le 2$**\nIn this case, the interval for $x$ is the intersection of $[0, 1]$ and $[z-1, z]$. Since $z \\ge 1$, we have $z-1 \\ge 0$. Also, since $z \\le 2$, we have $z-1 \\le 1$. The intersection is $[\\max(0, z-1), \\min(1, z)] = [z-1, 1]$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$f_Z(z) = \\int_{z-1}^{1} (1)(1) \\, dx = [x]_{z-1}^{1} = 1 - (z-1) = 2-z$$\n\nCombining these results, we get the complete PDF for $Z$, which is known as the triangular distribution:\n$$f_Z(z) = \\begin{cases} z & \\text{if } 0 \\le z < 1 \\\\ 2-z & \\text{if } 1 \\le z \\le 2 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the value of this PDF at $z = 1.4$. Since $1 \\le 1.4 \\le 2$, we use the expression for the second case:\n$$f_Z(1.4) = 2 - 1.4 = 0.6$$",
