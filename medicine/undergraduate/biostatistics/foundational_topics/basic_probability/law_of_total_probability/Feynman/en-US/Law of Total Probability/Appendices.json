This problem explores how to calculate the probability of a certain number of successes when the probability of success for any single trial is itself determined by a random initial setup. By applying the Law of Total Probability, we can find an \"effective\" success probability that simplifies the entire multi-trial experiment into a standard binomial distribution framework. ",

At the beginning of each trial, the system is randomly initialized into one of two configurations, $C_1$ or $C_2$. The initialization for any given trial is independent of all other trials. Configuration $C_1$ is selected with a probability $\\alpha$, and configuration $C_2$ with a probability $1-\\alpha$.\n\nAfter initialization, the system may transition to a specific target state, $A$. This transition is contingent on its initial configuration:\n- A system initialized in configuration $C_1$ transitions to state $A$ with probability $p_1$.\n- A system initialized in configuration $C_2$ transitions to state $A$ with probability $p_2$.\n\nA \"success\" is recorded for a trial if the system transitions to state $A$. Otherwise, the trial is a \"failure\".\n\nDerive the probability, denoted $P(k; n)$, of observing exactly $k$ successes in the $n$ trials.
