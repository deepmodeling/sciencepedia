            "introduction": "Before diving into calculations, it's crucial to build an intuition for what quartiles tell us about the shape of a dataset. This exercise challenges you to think conceptually about how data points are distributed. By considering a hypothetical scenario of a polarized survey, you'll connect the visual idea of a U-shaped distribution to the expected positions of the quartiles and the size of the interquartile range, a vital skill for interpreting real-world data summaries.

            "problem": "A political science research institute is analyzing public opinion on a highly divisive new policy. They survey a large, representative sample of the population and ask each participant to rate their level of support on a continuous scale from 0 (strongest opposition) to 10 (strongest support). After collecting the data, analysts find that the distribution of support scores is well-approximated by a symmetric U-shaped probability distribution. This indicates that most opinions are polarized, clustering near the extremes of 0 and 10, while very few people hold a neutral or moderate view around the midpoint of 5.\n\nLet $Q_1$ be the first quartile (25th percentile), $Q_2$ be the median (50th percentile), and $Q_3$ be the third quartile (75th percentile) of the support scores. The Interquartile Range (IQR) is defined as $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$.\n\nBased on the described symmetric U-shaped distribution of scores, which one of the following statements most accurately characterizes the expected values of the quartiles and the IQR?\n\nA. $Q_1$ will be close to 2.5, $Q_3$ will be close to 7.5, and the IQR will be approximately 5.\n\nB. The median ($Q_2$) will be close to 5, but $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ will also be close to 5, resulting in a very small IQR.\n\nC. $Q_1$ will be close to 0, $Q_3$ will be close to 10, and the IQR will be large, covering a significant portion of the total data range.\n\nD. The median ($Q_2$) will be close to 0, and both $Q_1$ and $Q_3$ will be in the lower half of the range.\n\nE. The IQR will be nearly zero because almost all respondents gave the same score.",
            "solution": "We model the support score as a continuous random variable $X$ on $[0,10]$ with a symmetric U-shaped distribution about the midpoint $m=5$. Symmetry implies the probability density function $f$ satisfies $f(5+x)=f(5-x)$ for all $x$ in its domain, and the cumulative distribution function $F$ satisfies $F(5+x)=1-F(5-x)$. From this symmetry, the median is at the center:\n$$\nF(5)=\\frac{1}{2}\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad Q_{2}=5.\n$$\nA U-shaped distribution means $f(x)$ is relatively large near the endpoints $0$ and $10$ and relatively small near the center $5$. Consequently, the CDF $F(x)$ increases rapidly near $0$, increases slowly around $5$, and then increases rapidly again near $10$. Therefore, the first quartile $Q_{1}$, defined by $F(Q_{1})=\\frac{1}{4}$, must lie close to the lower endpoint because the first $\\frac{1}{4}$ of probability mass accumulates near $0$. Similarly, the third quartile $Q_{3}$, defined by $F(Q_{3})=\\frac{3}{4}$, must lie close to the upper endpoint $10$.\n\nRelative to a uniform distribution on $[0,10]$ (which has $Q_{1}=2.5$, $Q_{3}=7.5$, and $IQR=5$), the U-shaped distribution shifts $Q_{1}$ downward and $Q_{3}$ upward, implying\n$$\nQ_{1}<2.5,\\quad Q_{3}>7.5,\\quad \\text{so}\\quad IQR=Q_{3}-Q_{1}>5.\n$$\nIn the extreme limit of perfect polarization at the endpoints, one would have $Q_{1}\\to 0$ and $Q_{3}\\to 10$, so $IQR\\to 10$. Thus, for a symmetric U-shaped distribution on $[0,10]$, the median is near $5$, $Q_{1}$ is near $0$, $Q_{3}$ is near $10$, and the IQR is large, spanning a substantial portion of the range.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A corresponds to a uniform distribution, not U-shaped.\n- B contradicts the U-shape by placing all quartiles near the center, implying a small IQR.\n- C correctly states $Q_{1}$ near $0$, $Q_{3}$ near $10$, and a large IQR.\n- D contradicts symmetry by placing the median near $0$.\n- E is false because polarization near both extremes does not imply identical scores, and the IQR is not near zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.",

Report only the final symbolic expression for $\\mathrm{IQR}$ as a function of $\\lambda$ in your final answer. Do not include units in your final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the interquartile range (IQR) for a random variable $T$ that follows an exponential distribution. The derivation must proceed from first principles. The time-to-event variable $T$ is characterized by a constant hazard rate parameter $\\lambda > 0$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the exponential distribution. The probability density function (PDF) for a random variable $T$ following an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is given by $f_T(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, and $f_T(t) = 0$ for $t < 0$. The CDF, $F_T(t)$, is the probability that the event occurs by time $t$, i.e., $P(T \\le t)$. It is found by integrating the PDF from $0$ to $t$:\n$$F_T(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) \\, d\\tau$$\nEvaluating this integral, we obtain:\n$$F_T(t) = \\left[ -\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) \\right]_{0}^{t} = -\\exp(-\\lambda t) - (-\\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0)) = -\\exp(-\\lambda t) - (-1)$$\nThus, the CDF for the exponential distribution is:\n$$F_T(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0$$\nFor $t < 0$, $F_T(t)=0$. Since time-to-event cannot be negative, we are concerned with the domain $t \\ge 0$. The CDF is strictly increasing for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe problem states that the $p$-th quantile, which we denote as $t_p$, is the value such that $F_T(t_p) = p$, where $p \\in (0,1)$. We can use this definition to find a general expression for the quantiles of the exponential distribution. We set the CDF equal to $p$ and solve for $t_p$:\n$$1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t_p) = p$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $t_p$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda t_p) = 1 - p$$\nTo isolate the exponent, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda t_p)) = \\ln(1 - p)$$\n$$-\\lambda t_p = \\ln(1 - p)$$\nSolving for $t_p$, we arrive at the quantile function for the exponential distribution:\n$$t_p = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(1 - p) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)$$\n\nNext, we apply this derived formula to find the first and third quartiles. The first quartile, $Q_1$, corresponds to the $p = \\frac{1}{4}$ quantile:\n$$Q_1 = t_{1/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, this can be written as:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$$\n\nThe third quartile, $Q_3$, corresponds to the $p = \\frac{3}{4}$ quantile:\n$$Q_3 = t_{3/4} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{3}{4}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\nSimilarly, this can be written as:\n$$Q_3 = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(4)$$\n\nFinally, the interquartile range (IQR) is defined as the difference between the third and first quartiles, $\\mathrm{IQR} = Q_3 - Q_1$. Substituting the expressions we found for $Q_1$ and $Q_3$:\n$$\\mathrm{IQR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(4) - \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$:\n$$\\mathrm{IQR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\left( \\ln(4) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\right)$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$\\mathrm{IQR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{4/3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln\\left(4 \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the interquartile range:\n$$\\mathrm{IQR} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\ln(3)$$\nThis result shows that, for an exponential distribution, the interquartile range is a constant value determined solely by the rate parameter $\\lambda$ and is independent of time.",
