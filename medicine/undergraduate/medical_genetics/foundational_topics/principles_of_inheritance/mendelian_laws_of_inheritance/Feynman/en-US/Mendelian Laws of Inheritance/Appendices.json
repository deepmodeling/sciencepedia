It describes a classic scenario of autosomal recessive inheritance. The problem is well-posed, stating all necessary assumptions and providing all data required for a unique solution. These assumptions—Mendel's laws, random gamete fusion, complete penetrance, no mutation, and independence of events—are standard and necessary for creating a formal, solvable model. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of any scientific or factual unsoundness, incompleteness, contradictions, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of a probability for a sequence of independent events, which can be modeled using the principles of Mendelian genetics and binomial probability.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability of a single child being affected by the autosomal recessive disease. The parents are both heterozygous carriers, with genotypes $Aa$. According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces two types of gametes, $A$ and $a$, each with a probability of $1/2$.\n\nThe possible genotypes of an offspring are determined by the random union of these gametes. We can use a Punnett square to visualize the outcomes and their associated probabilities:\n\n-   Probability of genotype $AA$: $P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   Probability of genotype $Aa$: $(P(A \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother})) + (P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(A \\text{ from mother})) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   Probability of genotype $aa$: $P(a \\text{ from father}) \\times P(a \\text{ from mother}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThe disease is expressed only in individuals with the genotype $aa$, and penetrance is complete. Therefore, the probability that any given child is affected is equal to the probability of that child having the $aa$ genotype. Let $p$ be the probability of a child being affected.\n$$p = P(\\text{affected}) = P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nConsequently, the probability that a child is unaffected (having genotype $AA$ or $Aa$) is $q$.\n$$q = P(\\text{unaffected}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$$\nAlternatively, $q = 1 - p = 1 - \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}$.\n\nThe couple plans to have $n=3$ children. The outcome for each child is an independent event. We need to find the probability that exactly $k=1$ of these $3$ children will be affected. This scenario is described by the binomial probability distribution. The probability of observing exactly $k$ successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials is given by the formula:\n$$P(X=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k q^{n-k}$$\nHere, a \"success\" is defined as a child being affected. We substitute the values $n=3$, $k=1$, $p=1/4$, and $q=3/4$ into the formula:\n$$P(X=1) = \\binom{3}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^1 \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{3-1}$$\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{1}$ represents the number of ways to choose $1$ affected child out of $3$ children, which is calculated as:\n$$\\binom{3}{1} = \\frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = \\frac{3!}{1!2!} = 3$$\nNow, we can compute the final probability:\n$$P(X=1) = 3 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^2$$\n$$P(X=1) = 3 \\times \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{9}{16}$$\n$$P(X=1) = \\frac{3 \\times 1 \\times 9}{4 \\times 16} = \\frac{27}{64}$$\nThis is the probability that exactly one of the three children will be affected. The result is an exact fraction as requested.",

            "introduction": "Mendel's laws extend beyond simple two-allele, dominant-recessive systems.

The description of alleles, dominance, codominance, and segregation is factually correct and a standard example in genetics education. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The parental genotypes are specified ($AO$ and $BO$), and the rules of inheritance (Mendel's laws) are explicitly stated.

There are no missing data, undefined terms, or internal contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a clear and standard problem in Mendelian genetics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution is derived from the fundamental principles of Mendelian inheritance as stated in the problem.\n\n1.  **Parental Genotypes and Gamete Formation**:\n    The mating is between two individuals with genotypes $AO$ and $BO$. According to Mendel's Law of Segregation, a heterozygous individual produces gametes containing each of its two alleles with equal probability.\n\n    -   The parent with genotype $AO$ is heterozygous. This individual will produce two types of gametes: those carrying the $A$ allele and those carrying the $O$ allele. The probability for each gamete type is $P(\\text{gamete } A) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{gamete } O) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    -   The parent with genotype $BO$ is also heterozygous. This individual will produce two types of gametes: those carrying the $B$ allele and those carrying the $O$ allele. The probability for each gamete type is $P(\\text{gamete } B) = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $P(\\text{gamete } O) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Offspring Genotypes**:\n    The random union of these gametes at fertilization determines the genotypes of the offspring. The probabilities of the resulting genotypes can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the uniting gametes. A Punnett square is a systematic way to represent this process.\n\n    |                 | Parent 2: Gamete $B$ ($P = \\frac{1}{2}$) | Parent 2: Gamete $O$ ($P = \\frac{1}{2}$) |\n    | :-------------- | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------- |\n    | **Parent 1: Gamete $A$ ($P = \\frac{1}{2}$)** | Genotype $AB$ ($P = \\frac{1}{4}$)          | Genotype $AO$ ($P = \\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n    | **Parent 1: Gamete $O$ ($P = \\frac{1}{2}$)** | Genotype $BO$ ($P = \\frac{1}{4}$)          | Genotype $OO$ ($P = \\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n\n    The four possible offspring genotypes are $AB$, $AO$, $BO$, and $OO$. Each occurs with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected.\n\n    -   $P(\\text{genotype } AB) = P(\\text{gamete } A) \\times P(\\text{gamete } B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(\\text{genotype } AO) = P(\\text{gamete } A) \\times P(\\text{gamete } O) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(\\text{genotype } BO) = P(\\text{gamete } O) \\times P(\\text{gamete } B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(\\text{genotype } OO) = P(\\text{gamete } O) \\times P(\\text{gamete } O) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n3.  **Mapping Genotypes to Phenotypes**:\n    The phenotype is the observable characteristic, which is determined by the genotype according to the rules of dominance and codominance.\n    -   Alleles $A$ and $B$ are codominant: Genotype $AB$ results in phenotype AB, where both A and B antigens are expressed.\n    -   Allele $A$ is dominant over $O$: Genotype $AO$ results in phenotype A.\n    -   Allele $B$ is dominant over $O$: Genotype $BO$ results in phenotype B.\n    -   Allele $O$ is recessive: Genotype $OO$ results in phenotype O.\n\n    The mapping is as follows:\n    -   Genotype $AB \\rightarrow$ Phenotype AB\n    -   Genotype $AO \\rightarrow$ Phenotype A\n    -   Genotype $BO \\rightarrow$ Phenotype B\n    -   Genotype $OO \\rightarrow$ Phenotype O\n\n4.  **Calculating Phenotype Probabilities**:\n    The probability of each phenotype is the sum of the probabilities of the genotypes that produce it. In this specific cross, each phenotype corresponds to a unique genotype.\n\n    -   **Phenotype A**: This phenotype arises only from the genotype $AO$.\n        $P(\\text{Phenotype A}) = P(\\text{genotype } AO) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   **Phenotype B**: This phenotype arises only from the genotype $BO$.\n        $P(\\text{Phenotype B}) = P(\\text{genotype } BO) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   **Phenotype AB**: This phenotype arises only from the genotype $AB$.\n        $P(\\text{Phenotype AB}) = P(\\text{genotype } AB) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n    -   **Phenotype O**: This phenotype arises only from the genotype $OO$.\n        $P(\\text{Phenotype O}) = P(\\text{genotype } OO) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\n5.  **Final Probability Vector**:\n    The problem requests an ordered probability vector for the phenotypes $\\{A, B, AB, O\\}$. The calculated probabilities are assembled in this specified order.\n\n    -   $P(A) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(B) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(AB) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n    -   $P(O) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n    The resulting vector is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} \\end{pmatrix}$.",

Such alleles are well-documented in biology (e.g., the allele for yellow coat color in mice). The principles cited (Mendel's laws, penetrance, lethality) are fundamental to the field. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary information to determine a unique solution. The parental genotypes are specified, the genetic effects of each offspring genotype are defined, and the population for the probability calculation (\"liveborn offspring\") is explicitly identified.\n-   **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in medical genetics that can be solved using fundamental principles of probability and inheritance. A solution will now be provided.\n\nThe problem describes a cross between two heterozygous parents, both of genotype $Aa$.\n$$\nAa \\times Aa\n$$\nAccording to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent produces gametes containing allele $A$ and allele $a$ with equal probability. Thus, for each parent, the probability of producing a gamete with allele $A$ is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of producing a gamete with allele $a$ is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring at conception and their corresponding probabilities can be determined by considering the random combination of these gametes. A Punnett square is a useful tool for this analysis.\n\n|          | Parent 2: $A$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | Parent 2: $a$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) |\n|----------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Parent 1: $A$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $AA$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          | $Aa$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n| Parent 1: $a$ ($P=\\frac{1}{2}$) | $aA$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          | $aa$ ($P=\\frac{1}{4}$)          |\n\nThe probabilities for each offspring genotype at conception are:\n-   Probability of genotype $AA$: $P(AA) = P(A) \\times P(A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n-   Probability of genotype $Aa$: $P(Aa) = (P(A) \\times P(a)) + (P(a) \\times P(A)) = (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) + (\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   Probability of genotype $aa$: $P(aa) = P(a) \\times P(a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, as expected. The initial Mendelian genotypic ratio is $1:2:1$ for $AA:Aa:aa$.\n\nThe problem states that the genotype $AA$ is embryonic lethal. This means that individuals with this genotype do not survive to be born. Therefore, they are excluded from the population of liveborn offspring. The viable (liveborn) genotypes are $Aa$ and $aa$.\n\nThe total probability of an offspring being liveborn is the sum of the probabilities of the viable genotypes:\n$$\nP(\\text{liveborn}) = P(Aa) + P(aa) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe problem asks for $p$, the probability that a randomly selected **liveborn** offspring exhibits the phenotype. This is a conditional probability. The event of exhibiting the phenotype corresponds to the genotype $Aa$, as given in the problem statement.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that a liveborn offspring exhibits the phenotype, and let $L$ be the event that an offspring is liveborn. We are asked to compute $p = P(E|L)$.\nBy the definition of conditional probability:\n$$\np = P(E|L) = \\frac{P(E \\cap L)}{P(L)}\n$$\nThe event $E \\cap L$ is \"the offspring exhibits the phenotype AND is liveborn\". The only genotype that satisfies both conditions is $Aa$. Therefore, the event $E \\cap L$ is equivalent to the offspring having the genotype $Aa$. The probability of this event at conception is $P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting the probabilities into the conditional probability formula:\n$$\np = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(\\text{liveborn})} = \\frac{P(Aa)}{P(Aa) + P(aa)}\n$$\nUsing the values we calculated:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{3}{4}}\n$$\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThus, among the liveborn offspring, the expected genotypic ratio is $2:1$ for $Aa:aa$. The probability that a randomly selected liveborn offspring has the genotype $Aa$ (and thus exhibits the phenotype) is $\\frac{2}{3}$.",
