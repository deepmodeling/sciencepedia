            "problem": "A rare autosomal recessive disorder at a single locus $L$ is caused by a mutant allele $a$; individuals with genotype $aa$ are affected under complete penetrance, whereas $AA$ and $Aa$ are clinically unaffected. Consider a mating between two first cousins (consanguineous union): one partner is clinically affected and molecularly confirmed to be genotype $aa$, and the other partner is clinically unaffected but molecularly confirmed to be a heterozygous carrier, genotype $Aa$. Assume equal viability of all gametes, random union of gametes, and no new mutation.\n\nUsing the foundational principles that gametes carry one allele from each parent and alleles segregate randomly during meiosis (Mendel’s law of segregation), construct the Punnett square for this $aa \\times Aa$ mating and, from first principles, derive the probabilities for each offspring genotype $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Then, under complete penetrance, compute the probability that an offspring will be clinically unaffected.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single row matrix in the order $P(AA)$, $P(Aa)$, $P(aa)$, $P(\\text{unaffected})$, using exact fractions or decimals without a percentage sign. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Disorder type**: Autosomal recessive, single locus $L$.\n- **Alleles**: Mutant allele $a$, wild-type allele $A$.\n- **Genotype-Phenotype Correlation**:\n    - Genotype $aa$: Affected (complete penetrance).\n    - Genotype $AA$: Clinically unaffected.\n    - Genotype $Aa$: Clinically unaffected (heterozygous carrier).\n- **Parental Information**:\n    - The mating is a consanguineous union between two first cousins.\n    - Partner 1: Clinically affected, genotype is $aa$.\n    - Partner 2: Clinically unaffected, heterozygous carrier, genotype is $Aa$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    - Equal viability of all gametes.\n    - Random union of gametes.\n    - No new mutation.\n- **Principles to be used**: Mendel’s law of segregation.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-defined and scientifically grounded.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based on fundamental Mendelian genetics, specifically autosomal recessive inheritance. This is a standard and well-understood mode of inheritance. The concepts of alleles, genotypes, phenotypes, and complete penetrance are core to medical genetics. The scenario involves a specific cross for which the parental genotypes are explicitly provided, which is a standard textbook problem.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information to determine the probabilities of offspring genotypes. The parental genotypes ($aa$ and $Aa$) are unequivocally stated. The assumptions (no new mutation, random segregation and union of gametes) are standard for such problems and ensure a unique, stable solution. The information that the parents are first cousins is contextually relevant for a rare recessive disease but is not required for the calculation itself, as the parental genotypes are given. It does not introduce any contradiction.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a straightforward application of Mendelian principles. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of offspring genotype probabilities from the mating of an affected individual (genotype $aa$) and a heterozygous carrier (genotype $Aa$). This will be done from first principles using Mendel's law of segregation.\n\n1.  **Gamete Formation**: According to Mendel's law of segregation, each parent contributes one allele from the locus $L$ to each of their gametes.\n    -   The first parent has genotype $aa$. During meiosis, the two $a$ alleles segregate. Consequently, all gametes produced by this individual must carry the allele $a$. The probability of this parent producing a gamete with the $a$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete is } a | \\text{parent is } aa) = 1$. The probability of producing a gamete with the $A$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete is } A | \\text{parent is } aa) = 0$.\n    -   The second parent has genotype $Aa$. During meiosis, the $A$ and $a$ alleles segregate into different gametes. Assuming equal viability, half of the gametes will carry the $A$ allele and the other half will carry the $a$ allele. Therefore, the probability of this parent producing a gamete with the $A$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete is } A | \\text{parent is } Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of producing one with the $a$ allele is $P(\\text{gamete is } a | \\text{parent is } Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n2.  **Punnett Square Construction**: A Punnett square is used to visualize the possible genotypes of the offspring resulting from the random union of these parental gametes. The gametes from the $Aa$ parent are listed along one axis, and the gametes from the $aa$ parent are listed along the other.\n\n|                  | Gamete from parent 1 ($a$) |\n|------------------|:--------------------------:|\n| Gamete from parent 2 ($A$) | $Aa$                       |\n| Gamete from parent 2 ($a$) | $aa$                       |\n\nThe Punnett square shows two possible outcomes for the offspring's genotype: $Aa$ and $aa$.\n\n3.  **Offspring Genotype Probabilities**: The probability of each offspring genotype is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the contributing gametes, based on the principle of independent events (random union of gametes).\n    -   **Probability of genotype $AA$**: An offspring with genotype $AA$ would require an $A$ allele from parent 1 ($aa$) and an $A$ allele from parent 2 ($Aa$).\n        $P(AA) = P(\\text{gamete is } A | \\text{parent is } aa) \\times P(\\text{gamete is } A | \\text{parent is } Aa) = 0 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 0$.\n    -   **Probability of genotype $Aa$**: An offspring with genotype $Aa$ would require an $A$ allele from one parent and an $a$ allele from the other. In this specific cross, this can only occur if the $A$ allele comes from the $Aa$ parent and the $a$ allele comes from the $aa$ parent.\n        $P(Aa) = P(\\text{gamete is } a | \\text{parent is } aa) \\times P(\\text{gamete is } A | \\text{parent is } Aa) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    -   **Probability of genotype $aa$**: An offspring with genotype $aa$ would require an $a$ allele from parent 1 ($aa$) and an $a$ allele from parent 2 ($Aa$).\n        $P(aa) = P(\\text{gamete is } a | \\text{parent is } aa) \\times P(\\text{gamete is } a | \\text{parent is } Aa) = 1 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n    The sum of probabilities is $P(AA) + P(Aa) + P(aa) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$, as expected.\n\n4.  **Probability of Unaffected Offspring**: The problem states that individuals with genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ are clinically unaffected. The probability of an offspring being unaffected is the sum of the probabilities of these genotypes.\n    $P(\\text{unaffected}) = P(AA) + P(Aa) = 0 + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe derived probabilities are:\n-   $P(AA) = 0$\n-   $P(Aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(aa) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(\\text{unaffected}) = \\frac{1}{2}$",

            "introduction": "In clinical genetics, risk assessment often involves updating probabilities based on new information, a process central to genetic counseling. This practice problem presents a classic scenario: calculating the recurrence risk for an autosomal recessive disorder after a couple has had an affected child . While the problem notes the parents are first cousins—a key factor for calculating *prior* risk—you will discover how the definitive evidence of an affected child allows you to determine the exact parental genotypes and calculate the *posterior* risk with certainty.",

            "problem": "In a large randomly mating population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, a single-locus Autosomal Recessive (AR) disorder is caused by a mutant allele $a$ at the locus with alleles $A$ and $a$. Assume complete penetrance, no phenocopies, negligible de novo mutation rate, and accurate diagnosis. A first-cousin couple are both clinically unaffected and have exactly one child who is affected by the AR disorder, thereby having genotype $aa$. Treat siblings’ genotypes as conditionally independent given parental genotypes. Using only fundamental principles of Mendelian segregation and the axioms of conditional probability (without invoking any memorized recurrence-risk shortcuts), derive the exact posterior probability that the couple’s next child will be affected by the disorder. Express your final probability as a fraction. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability that a couple's next child will be affected by an autosomal recessive disorder, given that the parents are unaffected but have already had one affected child. We will derive this probability from fundamental principles of genetics and probability theory.\n\nLet $A$ be the dominant allele and $a$ be the recessive allele responsible for the disorder. The possible genotypes are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Given complete penetrance, individuals with genotype $aa$ are affected, while individuals with genotypes $AA$ or $Aa$ are unaffected.\n\nLet $G_1$ and $G_2$ denote the genotypes of the two parents. Let $C_1$ and $C_2$ denote the genotypes of their first and second children, respectively.\n\nWe are given the following information, which we define as the evidence, $E$:\n$1$. The first parent is unaffected.\n$2$. The second parent is unaffected.\n$3$. The first child is affected, meaning $C_1 = aa$.\n\nWe are asked to calculate the probability that the second child is affected, conditioned on this evidence. This is the posterior probability $P(C_2 = aa | E)$.\n\nBy the law of total probability, we can express this by conditioning on all possible parental genotype pairs, $(G_1, G_2)$:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\sum_{(G_1, G_2)} P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2), E) \\cdot P((G_1, G_2) | E)$$\nThe sum is over all nine possible ordered pairs of parental genotypes: $(AA, AA)$, $(AA, Aa)$, $(AA, aa)$, $(Aa, AA)$, $(Aa, Aa)$, $(Aa, aa)$, $(aa, AA)$, $(aa, Aa)$, and $(aa, aa)$.\n\nThe problem states that siblings' genotypes are conditionally independent given parental genotypes. This is a standard assumption in genetics and means that knowing the genotype of one child provides no additional information about another child if the parents' genotypes are already known. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2), E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2))$$\nThe evidence $E$ about the first child is redundant for predicting the second child's genotype once $(G_1, G_2)$ is specified.\nOur expression simplifies to:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\sum_{(G_1, G_2)} P(C_2 = aa | (G_1, G_2)) \\cdot P((G_1, G_2) | E)$$\n\nNow, we must determine the posterior probability distribution of the parental genotypes, $P((G_1, G_2) | E)$. This term represents the probability of the parents having a particular genotype pair, given the evidence $E$.\n\nLet us analyze the evidence $E$ to constrain the possible parental genotypes:\n-   From the fact that the first child is affected ($C_1 = aa$), we can deduce that the child must have inherited one $a$ allele from each parent. Therefore, both parents must be carriers of the $a$ allele.\n-   From the fact that both parents are clinically unaffected, we know that neither parent can have the genotype $aa$.\n\nCombining these two logical deductions, the genotype of each parent must include one $a$ allele (to be a carrier) but cannot be $aa$ (to be unaffected). The only genotype that satisfies these conditions is $Aa$.\nTherefore, the evidence $E$ leads to the logical certainty that both parents have the genotype $Aa$.\n$$G_1 = Aa \\quad \\text{and} \\quad G_2 = Aa$$\nThere is no other possibility for the parental genotypes. This means the posterior probability distribution $P((G_1, G_2) | E)$ is:\n$$P((G_1, G_2) = (Aa, Aa) | E) = 1$$\n$$P((G_1, G_2) | E) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all other pairs } (G_1, G_2) \\neq (Aa, Aa)$$\n\nSubstituting this into our summation, all terms where $(G_1, G_2)$ is not $(Aa, Aa)$ become zero. The sum collapses to a single term:\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa)) \\cdot P((G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa) | E)$$\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = P(C_2 = aa | (G_1=Aa, G_2=Aa)) \\cdot 1$$\n\nThe problem is now reduced to finding the probability of an offspring being $aa$ from a mating between two heterozygous parents ($Aa \\times Aa$). This is a fundamental principle of Mendelian segregation. We can visualize this with a Punnett square:\n\n|       | $A$   | $a$   |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **$A$** | $AA$  | $Aa$  |\n| **$a$** | $Aa$  | $aa$  |\n\nThe possible genotypes of the offspring are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. Assuming fair Mendelian segregation, these genotypes occur with the following probabilities:\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = AA) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = Aa) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $P(\\text{genotype} = aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\nThus, the probability that the next child will be affected (genotype $aa$) is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$$P(C_2 = aa | E) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nIt is important to note that information such as the couple being first cousins and the population being in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium would be necessary to calculate the *prior* probability that two unaffected individuals are both carriers. However, the problem provides definitive *posterior* evidence: the existence of an affected child. This evidence updates our knowledge of the parental genotypes to certainty, rendering the prior probabilities associated with consanguinity and population allele frequencies irrelevant for calculating the recurrence risk. The derivation confirms that the conditioning on observed evidence is the crucial step.",

This practice will allow you to see precisely how and why consanguinity increases the incidence of rare autosomal recessive diseases at the population level.",

Let the population frequency of $a$ be $q$ and the population frequency of $A$ be $p = 1 - q$.

The genotype of interest is the homozygous recessive $aa$, which corresponds to the affected phenotype.\n\nScenario 1: Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE)\n\nUnder HWE, the population is assumed to be mating randomly. The frequency of a genotype is determined by the chance combination of alleles drawn from the population's gene pool. An individual with genotype $aa$ must inherit one $a$ allele from each parent. The probability of inheriting an $a$ allele from a randomly chosen gamete is equal to its frequency in the gene pool, which is $q$.\n\nSince the selections of alleles from each parent are independent events under random mating, the probability of an individual having the genotype $aa$ is the product of these individual probabilities:\n$$\n\\text{freq}(aa)_{\\text{HWE}} = q \\times q = q^2\n$$\nThe expected number of affected individuals, $E_{\\text{HWE}}(N_{aa})$, in a cohort of $N$ individuals is the total number of individuals multiplied by the probability of any single individual being affected.\n$$\nE_{\\text{HWE}}(N_{aa}) = N \\times \\text{freq}(aa)_{\\text{HWE}} = Nq^2\n$$\n\nScenario 2: Uniform Inbreeding Coefficient $F$\n\nThe inbreeding coefficient, $F$, is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in an individual are identical by descent (IBD). This means they are copies of the same ancestral allele. The probability that the two alleles are not IBD is therefore $1 - F$.\n\nTo find the frequency of the $aa$ genotype, $\\text{freq}(aa)_F$, we can consider two mutually exclusive ways an individual can be homozygous for the $a$ allele:\n\n1.  The two alleles are identical by descent (IBD).\n    The probability of this event is, by definition, $F$. If the two alleles are IBD, they are guaranteed to be identical. For the individual to be of genotype $aa$, this common ancestral allele must have been an $a$ allele. The probability of drawing such an ancestral allele from the gene pool is its frequency, $q$. Therefore, the probability of an individual being homozygous $aa$ due to IBD is the product of these probabilities:\n    $$\n    P(aa \\text{ and IBD}) = P(\\text{alleles are IBD}) \\times P(\\text{the common ancestral allele is } a) = F \\times q\n    $$\n\n2.  The two alleles are not identical by descent (not IBD).\n    The probability of this event is $1 - F$. If the alleles are not IBD, they can be considered as two independent draws from the population's gene pool. The probability of drawing an $a$ allele is $q$. The probability of independently drawing two $a$ alleles is $q \\times q = q^2$. Therefore, the probability of an individual being homozygous $aa$ when the alleles are not IBD is:\n    $$\n    P(aa \\text{ and not IBD}) = P(\\text{alleles are not IBD}) \\times P(aa \\text{ given not IBD}) = (1 - F) \\times q^2\n    $$\n\nThe total frequency of the $aa$ genotype is the sum of the probabilities of these two disjoint events:\n$$\n\\text{freq}(aa)_F = P(aa \\text{ and IBD}) + P(aa \\text{ and not IBD})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{freq}(aa)_F = Fq + (1 - F)q^2\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the deviation from HWE.
