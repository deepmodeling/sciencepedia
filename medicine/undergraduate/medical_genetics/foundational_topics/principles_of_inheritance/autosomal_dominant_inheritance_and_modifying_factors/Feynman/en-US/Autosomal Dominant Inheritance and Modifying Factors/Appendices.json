            "problem": "An autosomal gene encodes a homodimeric receptor whose function requires proper assembly of two identical subunits. Consider a family segregating a dominant-negative mutant allele, where the mutant subunit disrupts receptor function whenever it is present in a dimer. Individuals who are heterozygous carry one wild-type allele and one mutant allele. Assume the following foundational facts and conditions grounded in medical genetics and probability:\n\n- Mendelian segregation and equal allele dosage in a heterozygote imply equal production of wild-type and mutant monomeric subunits in the cell, so the fraction of wild-type monomers is $p_{W}$ and the fraction of mutant monomers is $p_{M}$, with $p_{W} = p_{M}$.\n- A modifier gene in the background can, in principle, skew monomer proportions by preferentially stabilizing one subunit type; however, in this pedigree the modifier is neutral, so there is no preferential stabilization or degradation of either subunit type.\n- Dimer assembly is random, with no preferential pairing, and the cellular pool is sufficiently large that drawing two subunits for assembly can be treated as independent sampling.\n- Only dimers composed of two wild-type subunits are functional, whereas any dimer containing at least one mutant subunit is non-functional due to the dominant-negative effect.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from first principles of Mendelian inheritance and the rules of probability for independent events, derive the fraction $f$ of functional dimers in a heterozygote. Express your final answer as an exact fraction with no rounding and no units.",
            "solution": "The user wants to solve the problem, and I've validated it. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction, $f$, of functional homodimeric receptors in a heterozygous individual. The individual carries one wild-type allele and one dominant-negative mutant allele.\n\nFirst, we must determine the relative proportions of the wild-type and mutant monomeric subunits available for assembly within the cell. Let $p_W$ be the fraction of wild-type subunits and $p_M$ be the fraction of mutant subunits. The problem states that due to Mendelian segregation and equal allele dosage in a heterozygote, there is equal production of both subunit types. This gives us the relation:\n$$p_W = p_M$$\nSince the wild-type and mutant monomers are the only two types of subunits that constitute the receptor, their fractions must sum to unity.\n$$p_W + p_M = 1$$\nWe have a system of two linear equations. Substituting the first equation into the second gives:\n$$p_W + p_W = 1$$\n$$2p_W = 1$$\nSolving for $p_W$, we find:\n$$p_W = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAnd consequently, the fraction of mutant subunits is also:\n$$p_M = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, the cellular pool of subunits consists of $50\\%$ wild-type and $50\\%$ mutant monomers.\n\nNext, we consider the process of dimer assembly. A functional receptor is a homodimer, meaning it is composed of two subunits. The problem states that dimer assembly is random and that the two subunits are drawn independently from the large cellular pool.\n\nThe problem defines a functional receptor as a dimer composed of two wild-type subunits. Any dimer containing at least one mutant subunit is non-functional due to the dominant-negative effect. We need to calculate the probability of forming a functional dimer, which we denote as $f$.\n\nA functional dimer has the composition (Wild-type, Wild-type), which we can represent as WW. The formation of such a dimer requires two independent events:\n$1$. The first subunit selected is a wild-type. The probability of this event is $p_W$.\n$2$. The second subunit selected is also a wild-type. The probability of this event is also $p_W$, as the selections are independent.\n\nThe probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. Therefore, the fraction $f$ of functional WW dimers is:\n$$f = P(\\text{WW}) = P(\\text{1st is W}) \\times P(\\text{2nd is W})$$\nSubstituting the probability $p_W$ for each event:\n$$f = p_W \\times p_W = (p_W)^2$$\nNow, we substitute the value of $p_W$ we calculated earlier:\n$$f = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2$$\n$$f = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nThus, the fraction of functional dimers in the heterozygote is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFor completeness, we can also calculate the fractions of the non-functional dimers. There are two types of non-functional dimers:\n- Hybrid dimers, containing one wild-type and one mutant subunit (WM or MW). The probability of forming a WM dimer is $p_W \\times p_M = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The probability of forming an MW dimer is $p_M \\times p_W = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$. The total fraction of hybrid dimers is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Mutant homodimers, containing two mutant subunits (MM). The probability of forming an MM dimer is $p_M \\times p_M = (p_M)^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThe sum of the fractions of all possible dimer types is:\n$$P(\\text{WW}) + P(\\text{WM or MW}) + P(\\text{MM}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the calculations. The fraction of functional receptors is solely the fraction of WW dimers.",

Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in transmission genetics, using clearly defined terms and well-established principles of Mendelian inheritance and probability theory. The assumptions provided are standard simplifications used to make the problem tractable. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**.\n\n**3. Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $A$ be the event that at least one of the $n$ offspring is affected by the condition. The most direct method to calculate the probability of this event, $P(A)$, is to first calculate the probability of its complement, $A^c$, which is the event that *none* of the $n$ offspring are affected. The desired probability is then given by the relation $P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the probability that a single offspring is affected. For a single offspring to be affected, two sequential and independent events must occur:\n1. The offspring must inherit the disease-causing allele.\n2. The offspring must phenotypically express the condition, given they have inherited the allele.\n\nLet us denote the disease-causing allele by $D$ and the normal allele by $d$. The transmitting parent is heterozygous ($Dd$) and the other parent is homozygous for the normal allele ($dd$). According to Mendelian segregation, the probability that an offspring inherits the disease allele $D$ and is therefore of genotype $Dd$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Let $G_i$ be the event that the $i$-th offspring has the $Dd$ genotype. The probability of this event is:\n$$P(G_i) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nThe penetrance of the condition is given as $p$. Penetrance is defined as the conditional probability that an individual with the disease-causing genotype expresses the associated phenotype. Let $E_i$ be the event that the $i$-th offspring is phenotypically affected. The problem defines penetrance as:\n$$P(E_i | G_i) = p$$\n\nThe probability that the $i$-th offspring is affected is a joint probability: the offspring must have a disease genotype AND express the phenotype. Since an individual must have the genotype $Dd$ to be affected in this scenario (as the $dd$ genotype is normal and there are no new mutations), the event $E_i$ is a subset of the event $G_i$. Therefore, the probability of an offspring being affected, $P(E_i)$, is:\n$$P(E_i) = P(E_i \\cap G_i)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(E_i) = P(E_i | G_i) \\times P(G_i)$$\nSubstituting the known probabilities:\n$$P(E_i) = p \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{p}{2}$$\nThis is the probability that any single offspring is affected.\n\nNext, we calculate the probability that a single offspring is *not* affected. Let this be the event $E_i^c$.\n$$P(E_i^c) = 1 - P(E_i) = 1 - \\frac{p}{2}$$\n\nNow we consider the event $A^c$, that none of the $n$ offspring are affected. This corresponds to the joint event that the first offspring is not affected, AND the second is not affected, ..., AND the $n$-th is not affected.\n$$A^c = E_1^c \\cap E_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap E_n^c$$\nThe problem states that the outcomes for each offspring are independent. Therefore, the probability of this joint-event is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(E_1^c) \\times P(E_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(E_n^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i^c)$$\nSince the probability of being unaffected is the same for all offspring, we have:\n$$P(A^c) = \\left(1 - \\frac{p}{2}\\right)^n$$\n\nFinally, we can find the probability of the event of interest, $A$, which is that at least one offspring is affected.\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A^c)$:\n$$P(A) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{p}{2}\\right)^n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the probability that at least one of $n$ offspring is affected, in terms of the number of offspring $n$ and the penetrance $p$.",

            "problem": "A family is seen in clinic for risk counseling regarding an autosomal dominant (AD) disorder caused by a single pathogenic variant. One parent is clinically affected and known to be heterozygous for the pathogenic variant; the other parent is unaffected and unrelated to the affected parent.

Let $p$ denote the lifetime penetrance, defined as the probability that an individual who carries the pathogenic variant manifests the disorder at some point in their lifetime.

No numerical evaluation is required. Do not include any units. If you introduce any additional symbols, define them explicitly. Express all probabilities as decimals or fractions, not as percentages.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a posterior probability using fundamental principles of genetics and probability theory. We are asked to find the probability that a clinically unaffected child of an affected heterozygous parent carries the pathogenic variant for an autosomal dominant disorder.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the child carries the pathogenic variant.\n- $C^c$: The event that the child does not carry the pathogenic variant.\n- $U_a$: The event that the child is clinically unaffected at their current age $a$.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability $P(C | U_a)$. To achieve this, we will use Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{P(U_a | C) P(C)}{P(U_a)}$$\nWe must determine each of the three terms on the right-hand side of the equation from first principles.\n\nFirst, let us establish the prior probability, $P(C)$. The problem states that one parent is heterozygous for the pathogenic variant, let us denote their genotype as $Gg$, where $G$ is the pathogenic allele and $g$ is the wild-type allele. The other parent is unaffected, unrelated, and the problem specifies no phenocopies, which implies this parent has the genotype $gg$. According to the principles of Mendelian segregation for this $Gg \\times gg$ cross, each child has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of inheriting the $G$ allele from the affected parent. Therefore, the prior probability of the child carrying the pathogenic variant is:\n$$P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe probability of the child not carrying the variant is the complement:\n$$P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nAs requested, we will first develop the logic using lifetime penetrance, $p$, before refining it for the age-specific case. Let $U$ be the event that a person is unaffected throughout their lifetime. The probability we would seek in this context is $P(C|U)$. The lifetime penetrance, $p$, is the probability that a carrier ($C$) becomes affected ($U^c$) at some point in their life, so $P(U^c|C) = p$. The probability of a carrier remaining unaffected for life is the complement, $P(U|C) = 1 - p$. For a non-carrier ($C^c$), the absence of phenocopies ensures they will remain unaffected, so $P(U|C^c) = 1$. By the law of total probability, the overall probability of being unaffected is $P(U) = P(U|C)P(C) + P(U|C^c)P(C^c) = (1-p) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{2-p}{2}$. Applying Bayes' theorem, the posterior probability of being a carrier given one is unaffected for life is $P(C|U) = \\frac{P(U|C)P(C)}{P(U)} = \\frac{(1-p)\\frac{1}{2}}{(2-p)\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1-p}{2-p}$. This establishes the general form of the solution.\n\nNow, we refine this derivation using the age-specific information provided. The logic remains identical, but the events and probabilities are now conditioned on the child's current age, $a$. We are given the event $U_a$, that the child is unaffected at age $a$.\n\nNext, we determine the conditional probability, $P(U_a | C)$. This is the likelihood of the evidence (being unaffected at age $a$) given the hypothesis (the child is a carrier). The problem defines the age-specific cumulative penetrance, $p(a)$, as the probability that a variant carrier has manifested the disorder by age $a$. Let $A_a$ be the event that a carrier is affected by age $a$. Then, by definition, $P(A_a | C) = p(a)$. The event $U_a$ for a carrier is the complement of $A_a$. Therefore:\n$$P(U_a | C) = 1 - P(A_a | C) = 1 - p(a)$$\n\nFinally, we determine the marginal probability of the evidence, $P(U_a)$, using the law of total probability. We partition the sample space based on the child's carrier status ($C$ or $C^c$):\n$$P(U_a) = P(U_a | C) P(C) + P(U_a | C^c) P(C^c)$$\nWe need to find $P(U_a | C^c)$, which is the probability of being unaffected at age $a$ given the child does not carry the pathogenic variant. The problem's assumption of \"no phenocopies\" implies that an individual without the variant cannot develop the disorder. Thus, a non-carrier is guaranteed to be unaffected.\n$$P(U_a | C^c) = 1$$\nSubstituting the known values into the law of total probability:\n$$P(U_a) = (1 - p(a)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(U_a) = \\frac{1 - p(a)}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1 - p(a) + 1}{2} = \\frac{2 - p(a)}{2}$$\n\nWe now have all the necessary components to calculate the posterior probability $P(C | U_a)$ using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{P(U_a | C) P(C)}{P(U_a)}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{(1 - p(a)) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{2 - p(a)}{2}}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the numerator and denominator yields the final closed-form expression:\n$$P(C | U_a) = \\frac{1 - p(a)}{2 - p(a)}$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the clinically unaffected child of age $a$ carries the pathogenic variant, expressed as a function of the age-specific cumulative penetrance $p(a)$.",
