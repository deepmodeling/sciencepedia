The fidelity of this process hinges on the specific base-pairing rules between the mRNA's codons and the tRNA's anticodons. This first exercise delves into Crick's wobble hypothesis, a key concept explaining how the genetic code's redundancy is managed with elegant efficiency, allowing a single tRNA to recognize multiple codons.  By applying principles of molecular geometry and thermodynamic stability, you will deduce the decoding capabilities of a specific tRNA, gaining insight into the mixture of precision and flexibility that governs protein synthesis.",

            "problem": "A core framework in molecular genetics is the Central Dogma, which asserts that nucleotide triplets in messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) are decoded by transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) anticodons within the ribosome. Decoding relies on hydrogen-bonded base pairing with antiparallel geometry and on the thermodynamic stability of the codon-anticodon duplex. In canonical Watson–Crick pairing, guanine pairs with cytosine via $3$ hydrogen bonds and adenine pairs with uracil via $2$ hydrogen bonds. In the ribosomal decoding center, the first two positions of the codon (positions $1$ and $2$, read $5'$ to $3'$ on the mRNA) are geometrically constrained so that only near-ideal Watson–Crick pairs are accepted, whereas the third position (position $3$) exhibits reduced geometric stringency. Let the net free energy of pairing be modeled qualitatively as\n$$\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\Delta G_1 + \\Delta G_2 + \\Delta G_3,$$\nwhere each $\\Delta G_i$ reflects the contribution of base pairing at codon position $i$; decoding is favored when $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$ is sufficiently negative to overcome entropic and kinetic costs.\n\nConsider a tRNA whose anticodon (written $5'$ to $3'$) is $5'$-I A U-$3'$, where I denotes inosine (the ribonucleoside of hypoxanthine produced by adenosine deamination in tRNA). The anticodon binds antiparallel to the mRNA codon, such that the anticodon base at the $5'$ end contacts the codon base at the $3'$ end (codon position $3$). You may assume:\n- Near-ideal Watson–Crick geometry is required at codon positions $1$ and $2$ for accurate recognition by the ribosome.\n- Inosine can form noncanonical but geometrically compatible pairs at the wobble position with certain bases if the resulting $\\Delta G_3$ penalty is small enough to keep $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$ negative.\n\nFrom these geometric and thermodynamic principles, derive the logic of Crick’s wobble hypothesis and use it to predict which set of mRNA codons (written $5'$ to $3'$) can be read by this $5'$-I A U-$3'$ anticodon without inducing a decoding error.\n\nChoose the single best option.\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid application of the principles of molecular genetics, specifically concerning codon-anticodon recognition within the ribosome. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to determine the set of messenger RNA (mRNA) codons, read in the $5' \\to 3'$ direction, that can be recognized by a transfer RNA (tRNA) molecule with the anticodon sequence $5'$-I A U-$3'$. The analysis will be based on the principles of base pairing provided: antiparallel binding geometry, strict Watson-Crick pairing at the first two codon positions, and relaxed \"wobble\" pairing at the third codon position.\n\nFirst, let's establish the pairing arrangement. The problem states that the codon and anticodon bind with antiparallel geometry. This means the $5'$ end of the codon pairs with the $3'$ end of the anticodon, and vice versa. Let the mRNA codon be represented as $5'$-N$_1$N$_2$N$_3$-$3'$, where N$_1$, N$_2$, and N$_3$ are the bases at codon positions $1$, $2$, and $3$, respectively. The tRNA anticodon is given as $5'$-I A U-$3'$.\n\nThe antiparallel alignment is as follows:\nmRNA codon:     $5' \\quad \\text{N}_1 - \\text{N}_2 - \\text{N}_3 \\quad 3'$\n                $\\quad \\quad | \\quad \\quad | \\quad \\quad |$\ntRNA anticodon: $3' \\quad \\text{U} - \\text{A} - \\text{I} \\quad 5'$\n\nThis shows the following pairings:\n1.  mRNA position $1$ (N$_1$) pairs with anticodon position $3$ (U).\n2.  mRNA position $2$ (N$_2$) pairs with anticodon position $2$ (A).\n3.  mRNA position $3$ (N$_3$) pairs with anticodon position $1$ (I).\n\nNext, we apply the geometric and thermodynamic constraints. The problem states that near-ideal Watson-Crick geometry is required for pairing at codon positions $1$ and $2$. This corresponds to the interactions governed by $\\Delta G_1$ and $\\Delta G_2$ in the provided qualitative model $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\Delta G_1 + \\Delta G_2 + \\Delta G_3$. A strong, stable interaction (negative $\\Delta G_1$ and $\\Delta G_2$) is required here.\n\n- **Pairing at Codon Position 1:** The base N$_1$ must form a standard Watson-Crick pair with Uracil (U). The canonical partner for U is Adenine (A). Therefore, N$_1$ must be A.\n\n- **Pairing at Codon Position 2:** The base N$_2$ must form a standard Watson-Crick pair with Adenine (A). The canonical partner for A is Uracil (U). Therefore, N$_2$ must be U.\n\nCombining these two results, any codon recognized by this tRNA must have the sequence $5'$-A U N$_3$-$3'$.\n\nFinally, we consider the pairing at codon position $3$, the \"wobble\" position. The base N$_3$ pairs with Inosine (I) from the anticodon's $5'$ end. The problem states that this position has reduced geometric stringency, allowing noncanonical pairs if the thermodynamic penalty (a less-negative or positive $\\Delta G_3$) is small enough. Inosine (I) is the nucleoside of the base hypoxanthine. Hypoxanthine is structurally similar to guanine but lacks the exocyclic amino group at the C$2$ position. This structural difference allows it to form stable hydrogen-bonded pairs with more than one base.\n\nAccording to the established wobble rules, which we are asked to derive the logic of:\n- **I-C pairing:** Inosine can form two hydrogen bonds with Cytosine (C). This pair is geometrically acceptable within the relaxed constraints of the wobble position.\n- **I-U pairing:** Inosine can form two hydrogen bonds with Uracil (U). This pair is also geometrically sound.\n- **I-A pairing:** Inosine can form two hydrogen bonds with Adenine (A). This pair is also permissible.\n- **I-G pairing:** A pairing between Inosine (a purine) and Guanine (a purine) would be sterically unfavorable, causing significant distortion of the RNA duplex. Such a purine-purine pair would lead to a large, positive $\\Delta G_3$, making the overall $\\Delta G_{\\text{total}}$ unfavorable for decoding. Thus, Inosine does not pair with Guanine (G).\n\nTherefore, the base N$_3$ at the third codon position can be C, U, or A.\n\nSynthesizing all three positions, the set of mRNA codons that can be read by the $5'$-I A U-$3'$ tRNA anticodon is:\n- $5'$-A U C-$3'$\n- $5'$-A U U-$3'$\n- $5'$-A U A-$3'$\n\nThese three codons all code for the amino acid Isoleucine. The mechanism prevents the misreading of the Methionine codon, $5'$-A U G-$3'$, which is crucial for cellular function.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. AUU, AUC, AUA**\nThis option lists the three codons derived from our analysis: $5'$-AUU-$3'$, $5'$-AUC-$3'$, and $5'$-AUA-$3'$. Each of these codons has the required $5'$-AU-$3'$ sequence for positions $1$ and $2$ and a base at position $3$ (U, C, or A) that can form a stable wobble pair with Inosine. This matches our derived set perfectly.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. AUU, AUC**\nThis option is an incomplete set. It correctly identifies $5'$-AUU-$3'$ and $5'$-AUC-$3'$ as being read by the tRNA. However, it omits $5'$-AUA-$3'$. As derived, the I-A pair at the wobble position is a valid interaction according to Crick's wobble hypothesis. Therefore, this option does not represent the full set of codons that can be read.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. AUU, AUC, AUG**\nThis option includes two correct codons ($5'$-AUU-$3'$ and $5'$-AUC-$3'$) but incorrectly includes $5'$-AUG-$3'$. As explained in the derivation, the pairing of Inosine (I) with Guanine (G) at the wobble position is sterically disallowed. This would result in a decoding error, misinterpreting the Methionine codon as Isoleucine. The wobble mechanism is specifically evolved to prevent such errors.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. UAU, UAC, UAA**\nThis option proposes codons beginning with Uracil (U) at position $1$. For the codon $5'$-UAU-$3'$, the base at position $1$ (U) would have to pair with the base at the anticodon's third position (U). A U-U pair is not a Watson-Crick pair. The problem explicitly requires near-ideal Watson-Crick pairing at codon positions $1$ and $2$. Since all codons in this option start with U, they all fail this first condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The derivation will be based on the law of mass action for a reversible binding equilibrium.\n\nLet $R$ represent the active siRNA–RISC complex and $M$ represent the target mRNA.
