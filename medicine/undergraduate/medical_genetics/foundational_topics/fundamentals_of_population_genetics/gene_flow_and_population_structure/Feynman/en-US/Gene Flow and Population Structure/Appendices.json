While theoretical formulas are straightforward, applying them to real-world data requires careful handling of statistical details. This exercise demonstrates how to move from raw sample allele frequencies to a robust estimate of $F_{ST}$ by first deriving and applying an essential correction for the downward bias that affects heterozygosity estimates from finite samples . This practice builds the critical skill of accounting for sampling effects, a necessary step in any empirical population genetic analysis.",

Two subpopulations have been sampled with equal sizes. Subpopulation $1$ has sample allele frequency $p_{1} = 0.2$, and subpopulation $2$ has sample allele frequency $p_{2} = 0.5$. Each subpopulation contributes $n = 40$ diploid individuals, so there are $m = 80$ gene copies sampled per subpopulation, and $M = 160$ gene copies in the pooled sample.\n\nAssume Hardy–Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) within subpopulations and that allele frequency estimates arise from sampling gene copies without replacement. Starting from the probabilistic definition of gene diversity (heterozygosity) as the probability that two randomly drawn gene copies are of different allelic types, and using the fact that the naive sample estimator $2\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})$ is biased downward in finite samples, derive unbiased estimators for the within-subpopulation gene diversity $H_{S}$ and the total (pooled) gene diversity $H_{T}$, and then compute the fixation index ($F_{ST}$) defined by the ratio of the excess of total over within-subpopulation diversity to the total diversity, namely $F_{ST} = \\dfrac{H_{T} - H_{S}}{H_{T}}$. Treat the sample sizes as the numbers of gene copies ($m$ for subpopulations and $M$ for the pooled sample) wherever finite-sample bias corrections are required.\n\nCompute $H_{S}$, $H_{T}$, and $F_{ST}$ exactly and express your final values as fractions (do not round).

            "problem": "A neutral, biallelic variant influencing a pharmacogenomic trait is segregating in a metapopulation of human subpopulations connected by symmetric migration. Consider the following scientifically grounded setting: an effectively infinite number of exchangeable demes, each with constant effective population size ($N_e$) equal to $2{,}000$, exchange migrants each generation at rate $m = 0.0025$, and have reached migration–drift equilibrium. Let the global allele frequency be $\\bar{p}$, and let $p_i$ denote the allele frequency in deme $i$. Assume no mutation and no selection. Using only core definitions and the sequential action of migration and genetic drift in one discrete generation, proceed as follows.\n\n1) Define the among-deme variance $V_t = \\operatorname{Var}(p_i)$ at generation $t$ and Wright’s fixation index ($F_{ST}$) as the standardized among-deme variance $F_{ST} = \\dfrac{V_t}{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}$.\n\n2) Starting from these definitions and the law of total variance, write the recursion that combines the variance-reducing effect of migration and the variance-inflating effect of binomial genetic drift in demes of size $N_e$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of Wright's fixation index, $F_{ST}$, in an infinite island model at migration-drift equilibrium. The solution proceeds in four stages as requested: (1) stating the given definitions, (2) deriving the equilibrium expression for $F_{ST}$, (3) calculating its numerical value for the given parameters, and (4) interpreting the result.\n\n### 1. Problem Definitions\n\nThe problem defines the among-deme variance in allele frequency at generation $t$ as $V_t = \\operatorname{Var}(p_i)$, where $p_i$ is the allele frequency in deme $i$. Wright's fixation index, $F_{ST}$, is defined as the standardized variance:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{V_t}{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar{p}$ is the constant global allele frequency across the metapopulation. The effective population size of each deme is $N_e = 2{,}000$, and the symmetric migration rate is $m = 0.0025$.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Recursion and Equilibrium Solution\n\nWe model the change in the among-deme variance, $V_t$, over one discrete generation. A generation consists of two sequential processes: migration followed by genetic drift.\n\n#### Effect of Migration\n\nLet $p_i(t)$ be the allele frequency in deme $i$ at the start of generation $t$. Following an exchange of a fraction $m$ of individuals with a migrant pool, the allele frequency in deme $i$ becomes $p'_i(t)$. In the infinite island model, the migrant pool is assumed to be a perfect sample of the entire metapopulation, so its allele frequency is the global average, $\\bar{p}$. The post-migration frequency is a weighted average:\n$$\np'_i(t) = (1-m)p_i(t) + m\\bar{p}\n$$\nThe variance of these post-migration frequencies across demes, denoted $V'_t$, is:\n$$\nV'_t = \\operatorname{Var}(p'_i(t)) = \\operatorname{Var}((1-m)p_i(t) + m\\bar{p})\n$$\nUsing the property $\\operatorname{Var}(aX + b) = a^2\\operatorname{Var}(X)$, and noting that $m$ and $\\bar{p}$ are constants across demes:\n$$\nV'_t = (1-m)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t)) = (1-m)^2 V_t\n$$\nMigration acts to reduce the variance among demes, homogenizing allele frequencies.\n\n#### Effect of Genetic Drift\n\nFollowing migration, the next generation within each deme is formed by random sampling of $2N_e$ gametes from the deme's gene pool, which has an allele frequency of $p'_i(t)$. This process is binomial sampling, which introduces a new component of variance. We use the law of total variance to find the variance of allele frequencies at the start of the next generation, $V_{t+1} = \\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t+1))$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t+1)) = E[\\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t))] + \\operatorname{Var}(E[p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t)])\n$$\nThe two terms are evaluated as follows:\n1.  The expectation of the conditional variance: The variance from binomial sampling within a deme is $\\frac{p'_i(t)(1-p'_i(t))}{2N_e}$. We take the expectation of this quantity over all demes.\n    $$\n    E[\\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t))] = E\\left[ \\frac{p'_i(t)(1-p'_i(t))}{2N_e} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2N_e} E[p'_i(t) - (p'_i(t))^2]\n    $$\n    We know $E[p'_i(t)] = \\bar{p}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(p'_i(t)) = E[(p'_i(t))^2] - (E[p'_i(t)])^2 = V'_t$. Thus, $E[(p'_i(t))^2] = V'_t + \\bar{p}^2$. Substituting these in:\n    $$\n    E[\\operatorname{Var}(p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t))] = \\frac{1}{2N_e} (\\bar{p} - (V'_t + \\bar{p}^2)) = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - V'_t}{2N_e}\n    $$\n2.  The variance of the conditional expectation: The expected allele frequency after drift is simply the frequency before drift, so $E[p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t)] = p'_i(t)$.\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Var}(E[p_i(t+1) | p'_i(t)]) = \\operatorname{Var}(p'_i(t)) = V'_t\n    $$\nCombining the two terms gives the full recursion for the variance:\n$$\nV_{t+1} = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p}) - V'_t}{2N_e} + V'_t = V'_t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N_e}\n$$\nSubstituting $V'_t = (1-m)^2 V_t$, we obtain the complete one-generation recurrence relation for $V_t$:\n$$\nV_{t+1} = (1-m)^2 V_t \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N_e}\n$$\n\n#### Equilibrium Solution\n\nAt migration-drift equilibrium, the variance is constant, so $V_{t+1} = V_t = V_{eq}$.\n$$\nV_{eq} = (1-m)^2 V_{eq} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) + \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N_e}\n$$\nSolving for $V_{eq}$:\n$$\nV_{eq} \\left[1 - (1-m)^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N_e}\n$$\nLet's analyze the term in the brackets. Given that $m$ is small ($m=0.0025$), we can use the approximation $(1-m)^2 \\approx 1 - 2m$. This is justified as $m^2 = 6.25 \\times 10^{-6}$ is negligible.\n$$\n1 - (1-2m)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e}\\right) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2N_e} - 2m + \\frac{2m}{2N_e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2N_e} + 2m - \\frac{m}{N_e}\n$$\nSince both $m$ and $1/N_e$ are small, the product term $m/N_e$ is of a smaller order of magnitude and can be neglected. So, the bracketed term is approximately $\\frac{1}{2N_e} + 2m$.\nThis leads to:\n$$\nV_{eq} \\left( \\frac{1}{2N_e} + 2m \\right) \\approx \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{2N_e}\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $2N_e$:\n$$\nV_{eq} (1 + 4N_e m) \\approx \\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})\n$$\n$$\nV_{eq} \\approx \\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{1 + 4N_e m}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the definition of $F_{ST}$ at equilibrium:\n$$\nF_{ST} = \\frac{V_{eq}}{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{1 + 4N_e m}}{\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4N_e m}\n$$\nThis is the classic equilibrium expression for $F_{ST}$ in the infinite island model.\n\n### 3. Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given $N_e = 2{,}000$ and $m = 0.0025$. We compute the product $4N_e m$:\n$$\n4N_e m = 4 \\times 2{,}000 \\times 0.0025 = 8{,}000 \\times 0.0025 = 20\n$$\nNow, we calculate the expected $F_{ST}$:\n$$\nF_{ST} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 20} = \\frac{1}{21}\n$$\nConverting this to a decimal and rounding to $3$ significant figures:\n$$\nF_{ST} \\approx 0.047619... \\approx 0.0476\n$$\n\n### 4. Interpretation\n\nAn $F_{ST}$ value of $0.0476$ indicates that approximately $4.8\\%$ of the total genetic variation for this neutral variant is due to allele frequency differences *among* subpopulations, while the remaining $95.2\\%$ resides *within* subpopulations. According to conventional benchmarks (e.g., those proposed by Wright), an $F_{ST}$ value between $0$ and $0.05$ signifies little genetic differentiation. This value is on the cusp of being considered 'moderate' differentiation.\n\nIn the context of medical genetics and pharmacogenomics, even this level of differentiation can be clinically meaningful. It implies that while populations are largely similar, there are measurable differences in allele frequencies. Relying on genetic risk associations or drug-response predictions from one population and applying them to another might be misleading. For instance, a drug dosage optimized for a population with one allele frequency might not be optimal for another population where the frequency is different. Therefore, this level of differentiation suggests that the cross-population portability of pharmacogenomic findings cannot be assumed and may require population-specific validation or adjustment.",
