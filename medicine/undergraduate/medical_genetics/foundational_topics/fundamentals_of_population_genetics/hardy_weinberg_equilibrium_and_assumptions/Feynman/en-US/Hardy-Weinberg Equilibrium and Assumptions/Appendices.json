            "introduction": "The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a powerful tool for estimating genetic parameters from observable traits. This first exercise focuses on a foundational skill: calculating allele frequencies when only the frequency of the recessive phenotype is known, a common scenario in medical genetics when studying recessive disorders. By working through this hypothetical case, you will practice the essential step of moving from population-level observations to the underlying allele frequencies, assuming the population meets the equilibrium criteria.

            "problem": "A species of deep-sea cnidarian, *Cryofax abyssalis*, commonly known as 'Abyssal Flares', exhibits variation in its bioluminescent properties. The ability to produce a bright, continuous glow is controlled by a single gene with two alleles. The allele for a bright glow ($G$) is dominant over the allele for a faint, pulsating glow ($g$). A large, isolated population of these organisms is studied by marine biologists. It is assumed that the population mates randomly and is not subject to mutation, gene flow, or natural selection with respect to this trait. A recent survey of the population reveals that 16% of the individuals exhibit the faint, pulsating glow phenotype.\n\nBased on these observations, what is the frequency of the dominant allele for a bright glow ($G$) in this population? Express your answer as a decimal.",
            "solution": "Assuming Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (random mating, no mutation, no migration, no selection), let $p$ be the frequency of the dominant allele $G$ and $q$ be the frequency of the recessive allele $g$. The Hardy–Weinberg conditions imply:\n$$\np+q=1,\\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\text{genotype frequencies } G G : p^{2},\\; G g : 2pq,\\; g g : q^{2}.\n$$\nThe faint, pulsating glow phenotype is recessive ($g g$), and its observed frequency is $0.16$. Therefore,\n$$\nq^{2}=0.16 \\implies q=\\sqrt{0.16}=0.4.\n$$\nUsing $p=1-q$, we obtain\n$$\np=1-0.4=0.6.\n$$\nThus, the frequency of the dominant allele $G$ is $0.6$.",

            "introduction": "A core tenet of the Hardy-Weinberg principle is its predictive power; it states that for a given set of allele frequencies in a gene pool, genotype frequencies will reach a stable equilibrium after just one generation of random mating. This practice problem simulates a conservation genetics scenario to demonstrate this key concept. You will calculate the initial allele frequencies from a mixed founding population and then predict the expected genotype frequencies in their offspring, illustrating how populations establish genetic equilibrium.

The crucial question for a geneticist is whether an observed deviation from the model is due to chance or the action of an evolutionary force. This exercise introduces the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) test, the statistical method used to answer that question, bridging the gap between theory and practical data analysis.

The genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes are as follows:\n- $B_1B_1$: High-intensity glow\n- $B_1B_2$: Medium-intensity glow\n- $B_2B_2$: Low-intensity glow\n\nA recent field survey collected and categorized a random sample of 1000 adult crabs from this population.

            "solution": "The process to calculate the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) statistic involves three main steps: first, determining the allele frequencies from the observed population data; second, using these frequencies to calculate the expected number of individuals for each genotype under the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE); and third, using the observed and expected values to compute the $\\chi^2$ statistic.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the allele frequencies.**\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the $B_1$ allele and $q$ be the frequency of the $B_2$ allele. The total number of individuals in the sample is $N = 348 + 489 + 163 = 1000$. Since each diploid individual has two alleles, the total number of alleles in the gene pool is $2N = 2000$.\n\nThe number of $B_1$ alleles is calculated from the homozygous ($B_1B_1$) and heterozygous ($B_1B_2$) individuals:\nNumber of $B_1$ alleles = $2 \\times (\\text{count of } B_1B_1) + 1 \\times (\\text{count of } B_1B_2)$\nNumber of $B_1$ alleles = $2 \\times 348 + 489 = 696 + 489 = 1185$\n\nThe frequency $p$ of the $B_1$ allele is the number of $B_1$ alleles divided by the total number of alleles:\n$$p = \\frac{1185}{2000} = 0.5925$$\n\nSince there are only two alleles for this gene, the sum of their frequencies must be 1. Therefore, the frequency $q$ of the $B_2$ allele is:\n$$q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.5925 = 0.4075$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expected genotype counts under HWE.**\n\nAccording to the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequencies of the genotypes in a population at equilibrium are $p^2$ for $B_1B_1$, $2pq$ for $B_1B_2$, and $q^2$ for $B_2B_2$. We can use our calculated allele frequencies to find the expected counts for each genotype in our sample of $N=1000$ individuals.\n\nExpected count of $B_1B_1$ ($E_{B_1B_1}$) = $p^2 \\times N$\n$$E_{B_1B_1} = (0.5925)^2 \\times 1000 = 0.35105625 \\times 1000 = 351.05625$$\n\nExpected count of $B_1B_2$ ($E_{B_1B_2}$) = $2pq \\times N$\n$$E_{B_1B_2} = 2 \\times 0.5925 \\times 0.4075 \\times 1000 = 0.4828875 \\times 1000 = 482.8875$$\n\nExpected count of $B_2B_2$ ($E_{B_2B_2}$) = $q^2 \\times N$\n$$E_{B_2B_2} = (0.4075)^2 \\times 1000 = 0.16605625 \\times 1000 = 166.05625$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the chi-square ($\\chi^2$) statistic.**\n\nThe chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(\\text{Observed} - \\text{Expected})^2}{\\text{Expected}}$$\n\nWe apply this formula for each genotype and sum the results.\n\nFor $B_1B_1$:\nObserved ($O_{B_1B_1}$) = 348\nExpected ($E_{B_1B_1}$) = 351.05625\n$$\\frac{(348 - 351.05625)^2}{351.05625} = \\frac{(-3.05625)^2}{351.05625} = \\frac{9.3406640625}{351.05625} \\approx 0.026607$$\n\nFor $B_1B_2$:\nObserved ($O_{B_1B_2}$) = 489\nExpected ($E_{B_1B_2}$) = 482.8875\n$$\\frac{(489 - 482.8875)^2}{482.8875} = \\frac{(6.1125)^2}{482.8875} = \\frac{37.36265625}{482.8875} \\approx 0.077375$$\n\nFor $B_2B_2$:\nObserved ($O_{B_2B_2}$) = 163\nExpected ($E_{B_2B_2}$) = 166.05625\n$$\\frac{(163 - 166.05625)^2}{166.05625} = \\frac{(-3.05625)^2}{166.05625} = \\frac{9.3406640625}{166.05625} \\approx 0.056250$$\n\nNow, we sum these values to get the total $\\chi^2$ statistic:\n$$\\chi^2 = 0.026607 + 0.077375 + 0.056250 = 0.160232$$\n\nFinally, we round the result to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\\chi^2 \\approx 0.160$$",
