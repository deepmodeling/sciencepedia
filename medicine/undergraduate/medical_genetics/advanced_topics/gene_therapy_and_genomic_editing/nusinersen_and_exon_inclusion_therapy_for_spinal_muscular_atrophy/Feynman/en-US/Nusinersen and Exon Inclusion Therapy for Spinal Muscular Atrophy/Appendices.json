The underlying model is a standard competitive binding equilibrium, a fundamental concept in biochemistry and biophysics. The provided biological context and numerical values are realistic. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the “displacement fraction of hnRNP A$1$”, which is defined as the fractional decrease in the occupancy of the intronic splicing silencer N$1$ (ISS-N$1$) site by the protein hnRNP A$1$ upon the introduction of the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), nusinersen.\n\nLet $S$ represent the free ISS-N$1$ binding site on a pre-mRNA transcript. Let $H$ represent the free hnRNP A$1$ protein and $A$ represent the free ASO. The problem states that binding is mutually exclusive, leading to two possible bound states: $SH$ (site bound by hnRNP A$1$) and $SA$ (site bound by ASO).\n\nThe system is governed by two equilibrium reactions described by the law of mass action:\n$1$. Binding of hnRNP A$1$: $S + H \\rightleftharpoons SH$\n$2$. Binding of ASO: $S + A \\rightleftharpoons SA$\n\nThe corresponding dissociation constants are given by:\n$$K_{d,H} = \\frac{[S][H]}{[SH]}$$\n$$K_{d,A} = \\frac{[S][A]}{[SA]}$$\nwhere $[H]$ and $[A]$ are the free concentrations of hnRNP A$1$ and ASO, respectively. The problem states these can be treated as constant.\n\nThe fractional occupancy of the binding site by a ligand is the concentration of sites bound by that ligand divided by the total concentration of binding sites, $[S]_{total}$.\nThe total concentration of sites is the sum of free and bound sites: $[S]_{total} = [S] + [SH] + [SA]$.\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional occupancy of the site by hnRNP A$1$ in the absence of the ASO. In this case, $[A] = 0$, which implies $[SA] = 0$.

            "problem": "A researcher studying spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) uses a splice-switching antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), analogous to nusinersen, that targets the intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) in the survival motor neuron 2 (*SMN2*) pre-messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA). In the wild-type context, the ISS-N1 region is occupied by heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1/A2, which represses inclusion of exon 7. The ASO binds the same region and relieves repression by occluding hnRNP binding, thereby promoting exon 7 inclusion.\n\nAssume a single binding site on the ISS-N1 region where the ASO and hnRNP competitively bind at equilibrium. Let the free concentrations be $[A]$ for ASO and $[H]$ for hnRNP, with dissociation constants $K_{d,A}$ and $K_{d,H}$, respectively. Under a standard competitive binding model, the fraction of ISS-N1 sites occupied by the ASO is\n$$\nf_A = \\frac{[A]/K_{d,A}}{1 + [A]/K_{d,A} + [H]/K_{d,H}}.\n$$\nAssume that exon 7 inclusion responds monotonically to $f_A$ such that the observed inclusion $E([A])$ can be represented as\n$$\nE([A]) = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\max}\\, f_A,\n$$\nwhere $E_0$ is the baseline inclusion when $[A]=0$ (reflecting residual repression by hnRNP) and $\\Delta E_{\\max}$ is the maximal increment in inclusion achievable when ASO saturates the site (thus the plateau is $E_{\\max} = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\max}$). Further assume $K_{d,A}$ and $[H]$ are unchanged between genotypes, the ASO remains fully complementary to ISS-N1, and there is no change in downstream spliceosome capacity at saturation.\n\nNow consider a mutant ISS-N1 in which specific nucleotide changes weaken hnRNP binding without affecting ASO complementarity, formally increasing $K_{d,H}$ while keeping $K_{d,A}$ constant. Predict how this mutation alters the ASO dose-response curve $E([A])$ compared with the wild-type ISS-N1, focusing on $EC_{50}$, baseline $E_0$, the maximal plateau $E_{\\max}$, and the Hill slope (steepness).\n\nWhich option best describes the expected changes to the dose-response?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posedness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System**: An antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) and a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) competitively bind to a single site on the intronic splicing silencer N1 (ISS-N1) of the SMN2 pre-mRNA.\n- **Function**: hnRNP binding represses exon 7 inclusion. ASO binding relieves this repression, promoting exon 7 inclusion.\n- **Model**: Equilibrium competitive binding.\n- **Variables and Constants**:\n  - `[A]`: Free concentration of ASO.\n  - `[H]`: Free concentration of hnRNP.\n  - `$K_{d,A}$`: Dissociation constant for ASO-ISS-N1 binding.\n  - `$K_{d,H}$`: Dissociation constant for hnRNP-ISS-N1 binding.\n- **Equation for Fractional Occupancy by ASO**: The fraction of ISS-N1 sites occupied by the ASO, `$f_A$`, is given by:\n$$\nf_A = \\frac{[A]/K_{d,A}}{1 + [A]/K_{d,A} + [H]/K_{d,H}}\n$$\n- **Equation for Exon 7 Inclusion**: The observed exon 7 inclusion, `$E([A])$`, is a function of ASO concentration:\n$$\nE([A]) = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\max}\\, f_A\n$$\n- **Parameter Definitions**:\n  - `$E_0$`: Baseline inclusion at `$[A]=0$`.\n  - `$\\Delta E_{\\max}$`: Maximal increment in inclusion.\n  - `$E_{\\max} = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\max}$`: Maximal plateau inclusion at ASO saturation.\n- **Assumptions**:\n  1. `$K_{d,A}$` and `$[H]$` are constant between wild-type and mutant genotypes.\n  2. The ASO remains fully complementary to the mutant ISS-N1.\n  3. The downstream spliceosome capacity at saturation is unchanged.\n- **Perturbation**: A mutation in ISS-N1 weakens hnRNP binding. This is formally modeled as an increase in `$K_{d,H}$`, while `$K_{d,A}$` remains constant.\n- **Question**: Predict the changes in the ASO dose-response curve `$E([A])$` for the mutant compared to the wild-type, specifically concerning the parameters `$EC_{50}$`, `$E_0$`, `$E_{\\max}$`, and the Hill slope.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the established biology of spinal muscular atrophy, the function of the SMN2 gene, and the therapeutic mechanism of splice-switching oligonucleotides like nusinersen. The use of a competitive binding model with dissociation constants is a standard and valid approach in pharmacology and biochemistry to describe such interactions. The mathematical models for fractional occupancy and response are standard forms (specifically, a Schild-type competitive model linked to a linear response). The assumptions are clearly stated and create a self-contained, well-posed problem. The perturbation (mutation affecting binding affinity) is a realistic biological scenario. The problem is objective, unambiguous, and solvable through logical derivation from the premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will be derived based on the provided model and assumptions.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe analysis requires evaluating how an increase in `$K_{d,H}$` affects the key parameters of the dose-response curve: `$E_0$`, `$E_{\\max}$`, `$EC_{50}$`, and the Hill slope.\n\n**1. Analysis of Baseline Inclusion, `$E_0$`**\n\nThe baseline inclusion `$E_0$` occurs at an ASO concentration of `$[A]=0$`. At this point, the system is at equilibrium with only hnRNP binding to the ISS-N1 site. The fraction of sites occupied by the repressor hnRNP is\n$$\nf_H(\\text{at } [A]=0) = \\frac{[H]/K_{d,H}}{1 + [H]/K_{d,H}}\n$$\nSince hnRNP is a repressor of exon 7 inclusion, the baseline inclusion `$E_0$` is inversely related to the fractional occupancy by hnRNP. A higher `$f_H$` means more repression and a lower `$E_0$`.\n\nThe mutation causes `$K_{d,H}$` to increase, signifying weaker binding of the repressor. This causes the ratio `$[H]/K_{d,H}$` to decrease. Consequently, the fraction of sites occupied by the repressor at baseline, `$f_H(\\text{at } [A]=0)$`, decreases. With less repressor bound, there is less repression of exon 7 splicing. Therefore, the baseline level of exon 7 inclusion, `$E_0$`, will be higher for the mutant than for the wild-type.\n\n**Conclusion:** `$E_0$` is elevated.\n\n**2. Analysis of Maximal Plateau, `$E_{\\max}$`**\n\nThe maximal plateau, `$E_{\\max}$`, is the inclusion level achieved at a saturating concentration of ASO (as `$[A] \\to \\infty$`). To find this, we evaluate the limit of `$f_A$` as `$[A] \\to \\infty$`:\n$$\n\\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} f_A = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} \\frac{[A]/K_{d,A}}{1 + [A]/K_{d,A} + [H]/K_{d,H}} = \\lim_{[A]\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d,A}}{[A]} + 1 + \\frac{K_{d,A}[H]}{[A]K_{d,H}}} = \\frac{1}{0 + 1 + 0} = 1\n$$\nAt saturation, `$f_A = 1$`, meaning the ASO fully occupies the ISS-N1 site, completely displacing the hnRNP. The resulting inclusion level is `$E_{\\max} = E_0 + \\Delta E_{\\max}$`. Crucially, the problem states that there is \"no change in downstream spliceosome capacity at saturation\". Because the maximal inclusion is dictated by this fixed spliceosome capacity when the site is fully activated (i.e., when `$f_A = 1$`), this maximal achievable level is a biological constant for both wild-type and mutant.\n\n**Conclusion:** `$E_{\\max}$` is unchanged.\n\n**3. Analysis of Potency, `$EC_{50}$`**\n\nThe `$EC_{50}$` is the concentration of ASO that produces an effect halfway between baseline and maximum. The effect is the increase above baseline, `$E([A]) - E_0 = \\Delta E_{\\max} f_A$`. The half-maximal effect occurs when this term equals `$\\frac{1}{2} \\Delta E_{\\max}$`, which requires `$f_A = 1/2$`. We solve for `$[A]$` when `$f_A = 1/2$`:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{[A]/K_{d,A}}{1 + [A]/K_{d,A} + [H]/K_{d,H}}\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}} + \\frac{[H]}{K_{d,H}} = 2 \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}}\n$$\n$$\n1 + \\frac{[H]}{K_{d,H}} = \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}}\n$$\n$$\n[A] = K_{d,A} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[H]}{K_{d,H}} \\right)\n$$\nThis concentration of `$[A]$` is the `$EC_{50}$`.\n$$\nEC_{50} = K_{d,A} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[H]}{K_{d,H}} \\right)\n$$\nThe mutation increases `$K_{d,H}$`. Since `$K_{d,A}$` and `$[H]$` are constant, the term `$[H]/K_{d,H}$` decreases. This causes the entire expression for `$EC_{50}$` to decrease. A lower `$EC_{50}$` corresponds to higher potency and a left-shift of the dose-response curve. This is intuitive: with a weaker competitor (hnRNP), less ASO is required to achieve 50% site occupancy.\n\n**Conclusion:** `$EC_{50}$` is reduced (left-shift).\n\n**4. Analysis of Hill Slope (Steepness)**\n\nThe steepness of the dose-response curve is described by the Hill slope. To assess this, we examine the functional form of the response. The effect, `$E([A]) - E_0$`, can be written as:\n$$\nE([A]) - E_0 = \\Delta E_{\\max} f_A = \\Delta E_{\\max} \\frac{[A]/K_{d,A}}{1 + [H]/K_{d,H} + [A]/K_{d,A}}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by `$K_{d,A}$`:\n$$\nE([A]) - E_0 = \\Delta E_{\\max} \\frac{[A]}{K_{d,A}(1 + [H]/K_{d,H}) + [A]}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for `$EC_{50}$`:\n$$\nE([A]) - E_0 = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\max} [A]}{EC_{50} + [A]}\n$$\nThis is the standard Michaelis-Menten or Langmuir binding equation, which corresponds to a Hill-Langmuir equation with a Hill coefficient (slope) of `$n=1$`. The mutation only changes the value of the parameter `$EC_{50}$` (and also `$E_0$` and `$\\Delta E_{\\max}$`), but it does not alter the underlying `$1:1$` binding stoichiometry or the functional form of the model.\n\n**Conclusion:** The Hill slope is unchanged (it remains `$1$`).\n\n**5. Analysis of Apparent Dynamic Range**\n\nThe apparent dynamic range is the difference between the maximal and minimal response, which is `$E_{\\max} - E_0$`.\nAs determined above:\n- `$E_{\\max}$` is unchanged.\n- `$E_0$` is elevated.\nTherefore, the difference `$E_{\\max} - E_0$` must decrease.\n\n**Conclusion:** The apparent dynamic range decreases.\n\n**Summary of Changes:**\n- **`$EC_{50}$`**: Reduced (left-shift).\n- **`$E_0$`**: Elevated.\n- **`$E_{\\max}$`**: Unchanged.\n- **Hill Slope**: Unchanged.\n- **Dynamic Range (`$E_{\\max} - E_0$`)**: Decreased.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n- **A. Left-shift with reduced `$EC_{50}$`, elevated `$E_0$`, increased `$E_{\\max}$`, and unchanged Hill slope; the apparent dynamic range increases.**\n  - **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly states that `$E_{\\max}$` increases and that the dynamic range increases. Our analysis shows `$E_{\\max}$` is unchanged and the dynamic range decreases.\n\n- **B. Right-shift with increased `$EC_{50}$` due to loss of ASO complementarity, reduced `$E_0$`, unchanged `$E_{\\max}$`, and unchanged Hill slope.**\n  - **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly claims a right-shift (increased `$EC_{50}$`), attributes it to loss of ASO complementarity (which is explicitly ruled out by the problem statement), and states that `$E_0$` is reduced.\n\n- **C. Left-shift with reduced `$EC_{50}$` and increased `$E_{\\max}$` because less competition permits a higher maximal effect; baseline `$E_0$` is unchanged; Hill slope is unchanged.**\n  - **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly claims that `$E_{\\max}$` increases and that `$E_0$` is unchanged. The reasoning for the increased `$E_{\\max}$` is also flawed; at saturation, the competitor is fully displaced regardless of its initial affinity, and the maximum effect is limited by downstream factors.\n\n- **D. No change in `$EC_{50}$`; baseline `$E_0$` decreases because repression is weakened; `$E_{\\max}$` and Hill slope remain unchanged.**\n  - **Incorrect**. This option incorrectly claims no change in `$EC_{50}$`. It also contains a logical contradiction, stating that `$E_0$` decreases *because* repression is weakened; weakened repression should *increase* the baseline.\n\n- **E. Left-shift with reduced `$EC_{50}$`, elevated `$E_0$`, unchanged `$E_{\\max}$`, and unchanged Hill slope; the apparent dynamic range `$E_{\\max} - E_0$` decreases.**\n  - **Correct**. This option accurately describes all the predicted changes based on our derivation: reduced `$EC_{50}$` (left-shift), elevated baseline `$E_0$`, unchanged maximal plateau `$E_{\\max}$`, unchanged Hill slope, and a decreased dynamic range.",

We perform statistical inference on these transformed samples.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean and sample variance for each log-transformed dataset.\nFor the pre-treatment log-transformed data ($x_i$):\nThe sample mean is $\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n_1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} x_i$.\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{6} (\\ln(1.25) + \\ln(1.31) + \\ln(1.47) + \\ln(1.38) + \\ln(1.29) + \\ln(1.42)) \\approx 0.300970 $$\nThe unbiased sample variance is $s_x^2 = \\frac{1}{n_1-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_1} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$.\n$$ s_x^2 \\approx 0.0038366 $$\n\nFor the post-treatment log-transformed data ($y_i$):\nThe sample mean is $\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n_2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_2} y_i$.\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{6} (\\ln(2.17) + \\ln(2.35) + \\ln(2.51) + \\ln(2.22) + \\ln(2.40) + \\ln(2.46)) \\approx 0.853762 $$\nThe unbiased sample variance is $s_y^2 = \\frac{1}{n_2-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n_2} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$.\n$$ s_y^2 \\approx 0.0032925 $$\n\nThe geometric mean fold-change is the ratio of the geometric mean of the post-treatment concentrations to that of the pre-treatment concentrations. This corresponds to exponentiating the difference of the means of the log-transformed data. The point estimate for the fold-change is $\\exp(\\bar{y} - \\bar{x})$.\nThe point estimate for the difference of the log-means is $\\bar{y} - \\bar{x} \\approx 0.853762 - 0.300970 = 0.552792$.\n\nTo construct the confidence interval, we use Welch's method for a two-sample $t$-test. The standard error of the difference between the means is:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{s_x^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_y^2}{n_2}} \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0038366}{6} + \\frac{0.0032925}{6}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00063943 + 0.00054875} \\approx \\sqrt{0.00118818} \\approx 0.034470 $$\nThe effective degrees of freedom, $\\nu$, are calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite equation:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{s_x^2}{n_1} + \\frac{s_y^2}{n_2}\\right)^2}{\\frac{(s_x^2/n_1)^2}{n_1-1} + \\frac{(s_y^2/n_2)^2}{n_2-1}} \\approx \\frac{(0.00118818)^2}{\\frac{(0.00063943)^2}{5} + \\frac{(0.00054875)^2}{5}} \\approx \\frac{1.4118 \\times 10^{-6}}{8.177 \\times 10^{-8} + 6.023 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 9.942 $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, the significance level is $\\alpha = 0.05$. We need the critical $t$-value for a two-sided test, $t_{\\alpha/2, \\nu} = t_{0.025, 9.942}$. From a $t$-distribution, this value is approximately $2.230$.\n\nThe margin of error ($ME$) for the difference of the log-means is:\n$$ ME = t_{0.025, 9.942} \\times SE \\approx 2.230 \\times 0.034470 \\approx 0.07685 $$\nThe $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference of population log-means, $\\mu_y - \\mu_x$, is given by $(\\bar{y} - \\bar{x}) \\pm ME$.\n$$ 0.552792 \\pm 0.07685 $$\nThe lower bound is $L = 0.552792 - 0.07685 = 0.475942$.\nThe upper bound is $U = 0.552792 + 0.07685 = 0.629642$.\n\nTo find the $95\\%$ confidence interval for the geometric mean fold-change, we exponentiate these bounds: $[\\exp(L), \\exp(U)]$.\nThe lower bound of the confidence interval for the fold-change is:\n$$ \\text{Lower Bound} = \\exp(L) = \\exp(0.475942) \\approx 1.60956 $$\nThe problem requires this answer to be reported to three significant figures. The value $1.60956$ rounded to three significant figures is $1.61$.",
