This strategy relies on manipulating pre-mRNA splicing to restore the triplet reading frame, allowing for the production of a partially functional protein.

            "problem": "An autosomal recessive disease due to a frameshifting deletion in the coding sequence of a large muscle protein is being considered for treatment with Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can induce exon skipping at the pre-messenger RNA stage, thereby altering the set of exons that are spliced into the mature messenger RNA. The Central Dogma of molecular biology and the triplet nature of the genetic code imply that the reading frame is preserved if and only if the net number of coding nucleotides removed is a multiple of $3$.\n\nA patient harbors a deletion spanning exons $46$–$50$ of the gene. For the purpose of this problem, model the coding consequence using the length-modulo-$3$ rule: the reading frame downstream of a deletion or skip remains intact if the cumulative number of removed coding nucleotides is congruent to $0$ modulo $3$. Exon lengths (coding nucleotides) are as follows: exon $46$ is $246$ $\\text{nt}$, exon $47$ is $117$ $\\text{nt}$, exon $48$ is $125$ $\\text{nt}$, exon $49$ is $100$ $\\text{nt}$, and exon $50$ is $155$ $\\text{nt}$. Three ASO strategies are considered: skipping exon $44$ ($129$ $\\text{nt}$), skipping exon $45$ ($154$ $\\text{nt}$), or skipping exon $51$ ($111$ $\\text{nt}$).\n\nStarting from first principles, determine the residue modulo $3$ of the cumulative removed length for the deletion of exons $46$–$50$, and then determine the new residue modulo $3$ after additionally skipping exon $44$, exon $45$, or exon $51$. Report your final answer as a single row matrix containing the three residues in the order $(44, 45, 51)$. A residue of $0$ indicates a restored reading frame. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, specifically the consequence of frameshift mutations and the mechanism of action for antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics aimed at exon skipping. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data—the lengths of the relevant exons in coding nucleotides—and a clear, formalizable rule based on modular arithmetic to determine the outcome.\n\nThe central principle guiding the solution is derived from the triplet nature of the genetic code. A sequence of coding nucleotides is translated into a sequence of amino acids in non-overlapping groups of three, known as codons. An insertion or deletion (indel) of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of $3$ will shift the translational reading frame, leading to a completely different and typically non-functional protein product downstream of the mutation. The problem formalizes this as a \"length-modulo-$3$ rule\": the reading frame is preserved if and only if the total number of removed nucleotides, $L$, is congruent to $0$ modulo $3$, written as $L \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the effect of the patient's existing deletion, which spans exons $46$ through $50$. Let $L_{\\text{del}}$ be the total number of coding nucleotides removed by this deletion. This is the sum of the lengths of the individual exons involved.\nThe given lengths are:\n- Length of exon $46$, $L_{46} = 246$\n- Length of exon $47$, $L_{47} = 117$\n- Length of exon $48$, $L_{48} = 125$\n- Length of exon $49$, $L_{49} = 100$\n- Length of exon $50$, $L_{50} = 155$\n\nThe total length of the deletion is:\n$$L_{\\text{del}} = L_{46} + L_{47} + L_{48} + L_{49} + L_{50} = 246 + 117 + 125 + 100 + 155$$\nTo determine the impact on the reading frame, we must calculate the residue of $L_{\\text{del}}$ modulo $3$. We can use the property of modular arithmetic that states $(a+b) \\pmod{n} = ((a \\pmod{n}) + (b \\pmod{n})) \\pmod{n}$. We find the residue of each exon length modulo $3$:\n- $L_{46} \\pmod{3} = 246 \\pmod{3} = 0$ (since $2+4+6=12$, which is divisible by $3$)\n- $L_{47} \\pmod{3} = 117 \\pmod{3} = 0$ (since $1+1+7=9$, which is divisible by $3$)\n- $L_{48} \\pmod{3} = 125 \\pmod{3} = 2$ (since $1+2+5=8$, and $8=2 \\times 3 + 2$)\n- $L_{49} \\pmod{3} = 100 \\pmod{3} = 1$ (since $100 = 33 \\times 3 + 1$)\n- $L_{50} \\pmod{3} = 155 \\pmod{3} = 2$ (since $1+5+5=11$, and $11=3 \\times 3 + 2$)\n\nThe residue of the total deleted length, $R_{\\text{del}}$, is the sum of these individual residues, modulo $3$:\n$$R_{\\text{del}} = L_{\\text{del}} \\pmod{3} \\equiv (0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 2) \\pmod{3}$$\n$$R_{\\text{del}} \\equiv 5 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 2$$\nThe initial deletion results in a frameshift because the residue is $2$, not $0$.\n\nNext, we evaluate the three proposed ASO strategies. Each strategy involves skipping an additional exon, which adds to the total number of removed nucleotides. For each strategy, we calculate the new total removed length modulo $3$. Let $R_{\\text{new}}$ be the new residue.\nThe new residue for skipping an exon with length $L_{\\text{skip}}$ is given by:\n$$R_{\\text{new}} = (L_{\\text{del}} + L_{\\text{skip}}) \\pmod{3} \\equiv (R_{\\text{del}} + (L_{\\text{skip}} \\pmod{3})) \\pmod{3}$$\nSince we found $R_{\\text{del}} \\equiv 2$, this simplifies to:\n$$R_{\\text{new}} \\equiv (2 + (L_{\\text{skip}} \\pmod{3})) \\pmod{3}$$\n\nStrategy 1: Skip exon $44$.\nThe length of exon $44$ is $L_{44} = 129$ nucleotides.\nFirst, we find the residue of $L_{44}$ modulo $3$:\n$$L_{44} \\pmod{3} = 129 \\pmod{3} = 0 \\text{ (since } 1+2+9=12 \\text{)}$$\nThe new cumulative residue, $R_{44}$, is:\n$$R_{44} \\equiv (2 + 0) \\pmod{3} \\equiv 2$$\n\nStrategy 2: Skip exon $45$.\nThe length of exon $45$ is $L_{45} = 154$ nucleotides.\nFirst, we find the residue of $L_{45}$ modulo $3$:\n$$L_{45} \\pmod{3} = 154 \\pmod{3} = 1 \\text{ (since } 1+5+4=10 \\text{)}$$\nThe new cumulative residue, $R_{45}$, is:\n$$R_{45} \\equiv (2 + 1) \\pmod{3} \\equiv 3 \\pmod{3} \\equiv 0$$\nThis strategy restores the reading frame.\n\nStrategy 3: Skip exon $51$.\nThe length of exon $51$ is $L_{51} = 111$ nucleotides.\nFirst, we find the residue of $L_{51}$ modulo $3$:\n$$L_{51} \\pmod{3} = 111 \\pmod{3} = 0 \\text{ (since } 1+1+1=3 \\text{)}$$\nThe new cumulative residue, $R_{51}$, is:\n$$R_{51} \\equiv (2 + 0) \\pmod{3} \\equiv 2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the three residues for skipping exon $44$, exon $45$, and exon $51$, respectively, presented as a single row matrix.\nThe calculated residues are:\n- For exon $44$: $R_{44} = 2$\n- For exon $45$: $R_{45} = 0$\n- For exon $51$: $R_{51} = 2$\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix containing these three values in the specified order.",

            "solution": "The problem statement poses a task of identifying the best computational pipeline for designing a gapmer antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) intended to induce ribonuclease H1 (RNase H1) cleavage of a specific RNA transcript. The problem is well-defined, scientifically grounded, and objective, providing clear criteria for what constitutes a successful pipeline. These criteria include ensuring strong on-target binding to accessible sites, maintaining thermal stability at physiological conditions, and minimizing potential off-target effects. The foundational principles provided—the Central Dogma, Watson–Crick pairing, statistical thermodynamics, the nearest-neighbor (NN) model, and the BLAST heuristic—are the correct and standard tools for this task. The problem is valid.\n\nA scientifically sound pipeline for ASO design must integrate several computational steps in a logical order, using state-of-the-art models and realistic parameters. The key components of an ideal pipeline are:\n\n1.  **Target Site Accessibility**: An ASO cannot bind effectively to a region of the target RNA that is sequestered in a stable secondary structure (e.g., a hairpin stem). A sophisticated approach does not rely on a single Minimum Free Energy (MFE) structure, which is often a poor predictor of the in-vivo state. Instead, it should use a partition function calculation to determine the ensemble probability, $p_{u}$, that the target nucleotides are unpaired across all thermally accessible structures. This provides a quantitative measure of accessibility.\n2.  **On-Target Binding Affinity**: The intrinsic strength of the ASO:RNA duplex formation is best predicted using the nearest-neighbor (NN) thermodynamic model. This model sums the enthalpy ($\\Delta H^{\\circ}$) and entropy ($\\Delta S^{\\circ}$) contributions of adjacent base-pair stacks to calculate the standard Gibbs free energy of hybridization, $\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T\\Delta S^{\\circ}$.\n3.  **Effective Free Energy**: A holistic prediction of binding must combine the intrinsic affinity with the energy required to disrupt the local RNA structure. The free energy cost of un-structuring the target site is given by $\\Delta G_{\\text{disrupt}} = -RT \\ln p_{u}$, where $R$ is the gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The effective binding free energy is thus $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{hybrid}} + \\Delta G_{\\text{disrupt}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{hybrid}} - RT \\ln p_{u}$. A more negative $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ indicates a more favorable interaction.\n4.  **Thermal Stability ($T_m$)**: The ASO:RNA duplex must be stable at physiological temperature ($37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$). This is assessed by calculating the melting temperature, $T_m$. Accurate $T_m$ calculation requires NN models that are corrected for physiological salt concentrations (e.g., $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] \\approx 150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $[\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}] \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and account for the specific chemical modifications (e.g., 2'-O-Methoxyethyl) in the gapmer's \"wings,\" as these significantly alter duplex stability. A $T_m$ significantly above $37^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, such as $\\geq 60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, is desirable.\n5.  **Off-Target Analysis**: The ASO must be specific to its intended target. An exhaustive search for potential off-targets across the entire relevant transcriptome (including both pre-mRNAs and mature mRNAs) is critical. Due to the size of the transcriptome, a fast heuristic like the BLAST seed-and-extend algorithm is necessary. Filtering potential off-targets should be based on biophysically meaningful criteria: (i) high sequence identity, especially long contiguous perfect matches, which can strongly nucleate binding, and (ii) a sufficiently favorable hybridization free energy ($\\Delta G_{\\text{off}}$), which indicates a thermodynamically stable off-target duplex capable of recruiting RNase H1.\n\nWith these principles established, we can evaluate the provided options.\n\n**A.

Perform transcriptome-wide off-target search against all annotated mature and pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) sequences using a BLAST-like heuristic with seed length $s=11$ requiring a contiguous perfect seed anywhere in the ASO, then ungapped extension followed by gapped extension if needed with an $X$-drop parameter, and compute off-target hybridization energies. Discard any ASO that has an off-target with either a contiguous match of $\\geq 14$ bases or predicted $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{off}}\\leq -15\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ within any transcript isoform. Rank survivors by more favorable (more negative) $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and absence of risky near-matches.**\n\nThis option describes a pipeline that is robust, modern, and scientifically sound in every particular.\n-   **ASO Length**: $L \\in [16,20]$ is the standard, effective range for RNase H1-dependent ASOs.\n-   **Accessibility**: Correctly uses the superior partition-function method to calculate $p_{u}$.\n-   **Energetics**: Correctly uses the NN model and correctly formulates the effective binding free energy $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ by incorporating the accessibility penalty.\n-   **Filtering**: The thresholds $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}\\leq -18\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$ and $T_{m}\\geq 60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ are reasonable and empirically validated benchmarks for potent ASOs. The specification of physiological salt concentrations and the need for modification-specific corrections is critical for accuracy.\n-   **Off-Target Search**: Correctly targets the transcriptome (pre-mRNA and mature mRNA). The BLAST-like strategy with a seed length of $s=11$ is a standard and effective balance of speed and sensitivity.\n-   **Off-Target Filtering**: Uses two complementary and biophysically relevant criteria: a stringent contiguous match length ($\\geq 14$ bases) and a thermodynamic stability threshold ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{off}}\\leq -15\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$). This is far superior to using statistical BLAST scores alone.\n-   **Ranking**: Ranks by on-target potency ($\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) and safety (off-target profile), which directly addresses the primary goals of the design.\n**Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Enumerate candidate ASOs of length $L\\in [12,14]$ and identify target accessibility using only the single minimum free energy (MFE) secondary structure; accept windows that are unpaired in that MFE. Compute DNA:RNA binding using NN to obtain $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}$ and combine with accessibility by adding $R T \\ln p_{u}$ (i.e., $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}+R T \\ln p_{u}$). Require $T_{m}\\geq 50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ assuming $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]=50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ without modification-specific corrections. For off-targets, search the human genome reference sequence with a BLAST-like heuristic allowing one mismatch within an $s=11$ seed and screen out any candidates whose best off-target has expectation value (E-value) $<10$. Rank by the smallest E-value.**\n\nThis option has multiple severe flaws.\n-   **ASO Length**: $L \\in [12,14]$ is generally too short for specific and potent RNase H1 activity in vivo.\n-   **Accessibility**: Relies on the less accurate MFE structure model.\n-   **Energetics**: The formula $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{eff}}=\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{37}+R T \\ln p_{u}$ is physically incorrect. Since $p_u$ (probability of being unpaired) is between $0$ and $1$, $\\ln p_u$ is negative. This formula would incorrectly make binding to structured regions (low $p_u$, more negative $\\ln p_u$) appear more favorable, which is the opposite of reality.\n-   **$T_m$ Calculation**: Uses a non-physiological salt concentration ($[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]=50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) and incorrectly ignores corrections for chemical modifications, leading to inaccurate predictions. The $T_m$ threshold of $50^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ is also less stringent.\n-   **Off-Target Search**: Incorrectly searches the genome (DNA) instead of the transcriptome (RNA). ASOs target RNA.\n-   **Off-Target Filtering**: Uses BLAST E-value, a statistical score, not a biophysical one. An E-value of $<10$ is an exceptionally loose filter that would fail to remove any significant hits. Ranking by E-value is also inappropriate.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Choose ASOs by maximizing percent guanine–cytosine (GC) content in $L=20$ windows and estimate melting temperature by the “$2$–$4$ rule” ($2^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ per adenine/thymine and $4^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ per guanine/cytosine). Ignore RNA secondary structure and treat all sites as equally accessible. For off-targets, require no matches to any $k=7$-mer “seed” corresponding to ASO positions $2$–$8$, by analogy to microRNA targeting, and otherwise skip extension and energetic evaluation. Rank by GC content.**\n\nThis option relies on overly simplistic and inappropriate heuristics.\n-   **Design Principle**: Maximizing GC content is a crude proxy for stability and ignores sequence-specific effects. It is not a sound design principle.\n-   **$T_m$ Calculation**: The \"$2$–$4$ rule\" is a primitive approximation that ignores NN effects and salt dependence. It is not used in serious therapeutic design.\n-   **Accessibility**: Ignoring RNA secondary structure is a critical flaw, as it's a primary determinant of efficacy.\n-   **Off-Target Analysis**: The analogy to microRNA seeding ($7$-mer at positions $2$–$8$) is biologically false. ASOs and microRNAs have different mechanisms of action and protein partners. This method would miss the vast majority of relevant off-targets. Skipping energetic evaluation is a major omission.\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Predict secondary structure accessibility by folding the ASO itself and eliminating candidates with any intramolecular hairpin of MFE $\\leq -3\\,\\mathrm{kcal\\,mol^{-1}}$, without modeling the target RNA. Use Wallace’s rule to approximate $\\Delta G$ and set $T_{m}\\geq 70^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ with no salt corrections. For off-targets, run a nucleotide BLAST with default word size $w=28$ against protein-coding complementary DNA (cDNA) only and exclude any hit with $\\geq 80\\%$ identity; do not compute hybridization free energies. Rank by fewest BLAST hits.**\n\nThis option demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the problem.\n-   **Accessibility**: It completely misidentifies the problem. The critical barrier is the structure of the *target RNA*, not (primarily) the ASO itself. While ASO self-folding is a secondary concern, ignoring the target's structure is a fatal design error.\n-   **$T_m$ Calculation**: Wallace's rule is another crude approximation (`$T_m \\approx 2(A+T) + 4(G+C)`), similar to the \"$2$–$4$ rule,\" and is inadequate. It also incorrectly omits salt corrections.\n-   **Off-Target Search**: Using a BLAST word size of $w=28$ is nonsensical for typical ASO lengths ($16-20$ nt), as it's longer than the query, ensuring no hits. Searching only protein-coding cDNA ignores pre-mRNA and non-coding RNA targets.\n-   **Off-Target Filtering**: Using `% identity` is less informative than thermodynamic stability ($\\Delta G$).\n**Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only one that presents a comprehensive, scientifically rigorous, and computationally modern approach that correctly integrates all the required components for ASO design.",
