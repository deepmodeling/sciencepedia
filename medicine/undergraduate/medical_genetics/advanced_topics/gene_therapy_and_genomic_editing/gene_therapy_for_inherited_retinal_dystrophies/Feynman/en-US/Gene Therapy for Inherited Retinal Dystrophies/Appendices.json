            "solution": "The user-provided problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe verbatim givens extracted from the problem statement are:\n- Total allowable length of the sequence between Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) for a single-stranded Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) vector: $4.7\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n- Length of the therapeutic coding sequence (Open Reading Frame, ORF): $3.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n- Length of noncoding regulatory elements: $300\\,\\mathrm{bp}$.\n- Length of the polyadenylation signal (polyA): $150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$.\n- The vector genome between ITRs must accommodate the sum of the promoter, ORF, regulatory elements, and polyadenylation signal.\n- The total length must not exceed the AAV capacity.\n- The ITRs are not included in the length budget.\n- The conversion factor is $1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$.\n- The objective is to compute the maximum allowable promoter length in base pairs (bp).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental and well-established principles of molecular biology and virology, specifically concerning the design of AAV vectors for gene therapy. The packaging capacity of AAV vectors, typically around $4.7\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, is a critical and realistic constraint in the field.

There are no contradictions within the problem statement.\n- **Realistic:** The scenario represents a routine calculation performed by molecular biologists when designing viral vectors, making it a realistic and practical problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe core principle is that the sum of the lengths of all genetic elements packaged between the AAV Inverted Terminal Repeats (ITRs) cannot exceed the vector's packaging capacity. We are asked to find the maximum possible length for the promoter element.\n\nLet $L_{\\text{total}}$ be the total packaging capacity of the AAV vector.\nLet $L_{\\text{promoter}}$ be the length of the promoter.\nLet $L_{\\text{ORF}}$ be the length of the Open Reading Frame.\nLet $L_{\\text{reg}}$ be the length of the regulatory elements.\nLet $L_{\\text{polyA}}$ be the length of the polyadenylation signal.\n\nThe relationship between these lengths is given by the inequality:\n$$L_{\\text{promoter}} + L_{\\text{ORF}} + L_{\\text{reg}} + L_{\\text{polyA}} \\le L_{\\text{total}}$$\nTo find the maximum allowable promoter length, denoted as $L_{\\text{promoter, max}}$, we set the total length of the components equal to the maximum packaging capacity:\n$$L_{\\text{promoter, max}} + L_{\\text{ORF}} + L_{\\text{reg}} + L_{\\text{polyA}} = L_{\\text{total}}$$\nSolving for $L_{\\text{promoter, max}}$ gives:\n$$L_{\\text{promoter, max}} = L_{\\text{total}} - (L_{\\text{ORF}} + L_{\\text{reg}} + L_{\\text{polyA}})$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in base pairs (bp). First, we must convert all given lengths to this common unit using the provided conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp}$.\n\nThe given lengths are:\n- $L_{\\text{total}} = 4.7\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 4.7 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 4700\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n- $L_{\\text{ORF}} = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 3.2 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 3200\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n- $L_{\\text{reg}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n- $L_{\\text{polyA}} = 150\\,\\mathrm{bp}$\n\nNow, we substitute these numerical values into the equation for $L_{\\text{promoter, max}}$:\n$$L_{\\text{promoter, max}} = 4700\\,\\mathrm{bp} - (3200\\,\\mathrm{bp} + 300\\,\\mathrm{bp} + 150\\,\\mathrm{bp})$$\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the lengths of the known components:\n$$L_{\\text{ORF}} + L_{\\text{reg}} + L_{\\text{polyA}} = 3200 + 300 + 150 = 3650\\,\\mathrm{bp}$$\nFinally, we subtract this sum from the total capacity to find the maximum promoter length:\n$$L_{\\text{promoter, max}} = 4700\\,\\mathrm{bp} - 3650\\,\\mathrm{bp} = 1050\\,\\mathrm{bp}$$\nThus, the maximum allowable promoter length that fits within the AAV vector's packaging constraint is $1050$ base pairs.",

It provides a clear, formalizable scenario based on established principles in virology and probability theory.

The probability mass function (PMF) for $K$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^k}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is a non-negative integer ($k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$) representing the number of vector genomes.\n\nThe clinical objective is for a photoreceptor to receive *at least one* vector genome. This corresponds to the event $K \\ge 1$. The probability of this event, which we denote as $p(\\lambda)$, can be calculated using the law of complementary events. The complement of the event $K \\ge 1$ is the event that the cell receives *exactly zero* vector genomes, i.e., $K=0$.\n\nTherefore, the probability of a cell receiving at least one genome is:\n$$p(\\lambda) = P(K \\ge 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\n\nWe can find the probability $P(K=0)$ by substituting $k=0$ into the Poisson PMF:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)\\lambda^0}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $\\lambda^0 = 1$), and the factorial of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $0! = 1$). Substituting these values, we get:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda) \\cdot 1}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $p(\\lambda)$:\n$$p(\\lambda) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the probability that a photoreceptor receives at least one vector genome as a function of the MOI, $\\lambda$. This probability also represents the fraction of transduced cells in the population under the assumption of a large number of cells.\n\nThe problem specifies that the target fraction of transduced cells is $p = 0.9$. To find the minimal MOI $\\lambda$ required to achieve this, we set our derived expression equal to this value:\n$$0.9 = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n\nWe now solve this equation for $\\lambda$. First, we isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = 1 - 0.9$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = 0.1$$\n\nTo solve for $\\lambda$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda)) = \\ln(0.1)$$\n\nUsing the property that the natural logarithm is the inverse function of the exponential function, $\\ln(\\exp(x)) = x$, we have:\n$$-\\lambda = \\ln(0.1)$$\n\nMultiplying by $-1$ gives:\n$$\\lambda = -\\ln(0.1)$$\n\nTo provide the answer in its simplest closed form, we can use the logarithm property $\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(a) - \\ln(b)$.

            "problem": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-delivered cytidine base editors are being explored to correct pathogenic point variants causing inherited retinal dystrophies by installing a cytidine-to-thymidine ($\\mathrm{C}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{T}$) transition at a specified genomic cytidine. Consider a design using the Streptococcus pyogenes CRISPR-associated protein 9 (SpCas9) cytidine base editor, which binds a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) of the form $\\mathrm{NGG}$ and uses a guide RNA to direct binding to a $20$-nucleotide protospacer immediately $5^{\\prime}$ of the PAM on the edited strand. For the SpCas9 cytidine base editor considered here, the experimentally defined active editing window spans protospacer positions $4$ through $8$ (inclusive), where position indexing is defined such that the base immediately adjacent to the PAM within the protospacer is position $1$, and indices increase moving away from the PAM within the protospacer.\n\nYou are targeting a pathogenic cytidine in an exon of a photoreceptor gene implicated in inherited retinal dystrophy. A candidate on-target site on the edited strand is:\n\n5′–GCTACGTACGCCACGTCCAG–AGG–3′\n\nwhere the $20$-nucleotide protospacer is 5′–GCTACGTACGCCACGTCCAG–3′ and the PAM is 5′–AGG–3′.

No rounding is required. The answer is unitless.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, specifically using a cytidine base editor. The parameters, such as the protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM) sequence for SpCas9 ($NGG$), the protospacer length ($20$ nucleotides), and the concept of an editing window, are all standard and well-established in the field. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information, clear definitions for the coordinate systems used (indices $j$ and $k$), and a specific, unambiguous question to be answered. The language used is objective and technical. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for two main tasks: first, to derive a general expression relating two different coordinate systems for nucleotide positions within a protospacer, and second, to use this relationship to determine if a specific target nucleotide falls within a defined active window.\n\nLet $L$ be the length of the protospacer. The problem states that the protospacer is $20$ nucleotides long, so $L=20$.\n\nThe problem defines two indexing systems for nucleotide positions within this protospacer:\n1.  The index $j$ is counted from the $5^{\\prime}$ end of the protospacer, which is the PAM-distal end. The first nucleotide at the $5^{\\prime}$ end is at position $j=1$, and the last nucleotide at the $3^{\\prime}$ end (PAM-proximal) is at position $j=L$.\n2.  The index $k$ is counted from the $3^{\\prime}$ end of the protospacer, which is the PAM-proximal end. The base immediately adjacent to the PAM is at position $k=1$. The indices increase moving away from the PAM towards the $5^{\\prime}$ end. Thus, the nucleotide at the $5^{\\prime}$ end (PAM-distal) is at position $k=L$.\n\nWe can visualize the two indexing schemes for a protospacer of length $L$:\n$$\n\\text{Protospacer Sequence: } 5^{\\prime} - N_1 N_2 \\dots N_{L-1} N_L - 3^{\\prime}\n$$\n$$\nj\\text{-index (from } 5^{\\prime} \\text{ end): } 1, 2, \\dots, L-1, L\n$$\n$$\nk\\text{-index (from } 3^{\\prime} \\text{ end): } L, L-1, \\dots, 2, 1\n$$\n\nLet us consider a single nucleotide at an arbitrary position within the protospacer. If this nucleotide is at position $j$ when counting from the $5^{\\prime}$ end, there are $j-1$ nucleotides before it and $L-j$ nucleotides after it (towards the $3^{\\prime}$ end). The index $k$ counts the position from the $3^{\\prime}$ end. The nucleotide at position $k$ has $k-1$ nucleotides between it and the $3^{\\prime}$ end. Therefore, the number of nucleotides from our arbitrary position to the $3^{\\prime}$ end, inclusive, is $(L-j)+1$. This count is, by definition, the index $k$.\n\nThus, we arrive at the general expression relating $k$ and $j$:\n$$\nk = (L - j) + 1 = L + 1 - j\n$$\nThis is the expression for the position $k$ as a function of the position $j$ and the protospacer length $L$. This completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we must determine if the target cytidine ($C$) located at position $j=14$ falls within the base editor's active window.\nThe given values are:\nProtospacer length, $L = 20$.\nPosition of the target cytidine, $j = 14$.\n\nWe use the derived formula to find the position $k$ of this target cytidine:\n$$\nk = L + 1 - j = 20 + 1 - 14\n$$\n$$\nk = 21 - 14\n$$\n$$\nk = 7\n$$\nThe position of the target cytidine in the PAM-proximal coordinate system is $k=7$.\n\nThe problem states that the active editing window for the SpCas9 cytidine base editor spans protospacer positions $4$ through $8$, inclusive. In terms of the $k$-index, this window is described by the interval $[4, 8]$. We must check if our calculated value of $k$ falls within this interval.\nThe condition to be met is:\n$$\n4 \\le k \\le 8\n$$\nSubstituting our calculated value $k=7$:\n$$\n4 \\le 7 \\le 8\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the target cytidine at $j=14$ lies within the active editing window.\n\nFinally, we must compute the indicator variable $I$, which is defined as:\n$$\nI = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } k \\in [4, 8] \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nSince we found that $k=7$ is within the inclusive interval $[4, 8]$, the value of the indicator variable is $I=1$.",
