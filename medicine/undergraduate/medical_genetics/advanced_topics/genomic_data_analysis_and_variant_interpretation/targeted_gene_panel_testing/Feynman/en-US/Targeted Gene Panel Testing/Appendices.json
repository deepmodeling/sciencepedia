Consider a single genomic site covered by $C$ independent reads, each yielding either a reference or alternate base call. Let the per-read probability of a base-calling error that specifically produces the alternate allele when the true state is reference be $\\epsilon$, assumed constant across reads and independent between reads. Suppose a mosaic variant is present at true alternate-allele fraction $a$, so that a read is sampled from a variant molecule with probability $a$ and from a reference molecule with probability $1-a$. Reads from variant molecules are called as alternate with probability $1-\\epsilon$, and reads from reference molecules are called as alternate with probability $\\epsilon$.\n\nDefine the null hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_0$ as “no true variant at the site,” and the alternative hypothesis $\\mathcal{H}_1$ as “a mosaic variant with allele fraction $a$ is present.” Under either hypothesis, let $X$ denote the number of reads supporting the alternate allele out of $C$ total reads.

No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of statistical power for a hypothesis test concerning a single-nucleotide variant. The number of reads, $X$, supporting the alternate allele out of a total of $C$ independent reads follows a binomial distribution, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, p)$, where $p$ is the probability that a single read is called as the alternate allele.\n\nFirst, we must derive the expression for the success probability $p$ for a single Bernoulli trial (a single read). A read is sampled from a variant DNA molecule with probability $a$ and from a reference DNA molecule with probability $1-a$. The probability of a read being called as alternate depends on its true origin. Let $A$ be the event that a read is called as alternate. Let $V$ be the event that a read is sampled from a variant molecule, and $R$ be the event that it is sampled from a reference molecule. By the law of total probability:\n$$\np = \\Pr(A) = \\Pr(A|V)\\Pr(V) + \\Pr(A|R)\\Pr(R)\n$$\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- $\\Pr(V) = a$\n- $\\Pr(R) = 1-a$\n- $\\Pr(A|V) = 1-\\epsilon$ (a true variant read is correctly identified as alternate)\n- $\\Pr(A|R) = \\epsilon$ (a true reference read is incorrectly identified as alternate)\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $p$ yields the general expression for the success probability:\n$$\np(a, \\epsilon) = (1-\\epsilon)a + \\epsilon(1-a) = a - a\\epsilon + \\epsilon - a\\epsilon = a(1-2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon\n$$\n\nNow, we derive the specific success probabilities under the null and alternative hypotheses.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, $\\mathcal{H}_0$, there is no true variant, which corresponds to an allele fraction $a=0$. The success probability, $p_0$, is:\n$$\np_0 = p(0, \\epsilon) = 0 \\cdot (1-2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon = \\epsilon\n$$\nThus, under $\\mathcal{H}_0$, the number of alternate reads $X$ is distributed as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, \\epsilon)$.\n\nUnder the alternative hypothesis, $\\mathcal{H}_1$, a mosaic variant is present with a true allele fraction $a$. The success probability, $p_1$, is:\n$$\np_1 = p(a, \\epsilon) = a(1-2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon\n$$\nThus, under $\\mathcal{H}_1$, the number of alternate reads $X$ is distributed as $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, p_1)$.\n\nNext, we must determine the critical value $k^{\\ast}$ for the test. The test calls a variant if $X \\geq k^{\\ast}$. The value of $k^{\\ast}$ is chosen to control the Type I error rate at significance level $\\alpha=0.05$. The criterion is:\n$$\n\\Pr_{\\mathcal{H}_0}\\!\\left(X \\geq k^{\\ast}\\right) \\leq \\alpha \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\Pr_{\\mathcal{H}_0}\\!\\left(X \\geq k^{\\ast}-1\\right) > \\alpha\n$$\nWe use the distribution under $\\mathcal{H}_0$, which is $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, p_0)$ with parameters $C=500$ and $p_0 = \\epsilon = 0.005$.\nThe expected number of alternate reads under $\\mathcal{H}_0$ is $\\mu_0 = C p_0 = 500 \\times 0.005 = 2.5$.\nSince $C$ is large and $p_0$ is small, we can accurately approximate this binomial distribution with a Poisson distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda_0 = C p_0 = 2.5$. The use of this approximation is justified as $C=500 > 50$ and $C p_0 = 2.5 < 5$, which are common heuristics for a good Poisson approximation to the binomial.\nSo, under $\\mathcal{H}_0$, $X \\approx \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_0=2.5)$. The probability mass function is $\\Pr(X=k) = \\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda_0)\\lambda_0^k}{k!}$. We need to find $k^{\\ast}$ such that $\\sum_{k=k^{\\ast}}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\exp(-2.5)2.5^k}{k!} \\leq 0.05$. We can compute the survival function $\\Pr(X \\geq k)$ for successive values of $k$:\n- $\\Pr(X \\geq 5) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\frac{\\exp(-2.5)2.5^k}{k!} \\approx 1 - 0.8912 = 0.1088$\n- $\\Pr(X \\geq 6) = 1 - \\sum_{k=0}^{5} \\frac{\\exp(-2.5)2.5^k}{k!} \\approx 1 - 0.9580 = 0.0420$\nSince $\\Pr(X \\geq 6) \\approx 0.0420 \\leq 0.05$ and $\\Pr(X \\geq 5) \\approx 0.1088 > 0.05$, the critical value is $k^{\\ast}=6$.\n\nNow we calculate the statistical power, which is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative is true. The power is $\\Pr_{\\mathcal{H}_1}(X \\geq k^{\\ast})$.\nUnder $\\mathcal{H}_1$, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, p_1)$. We first calculate $p_1$ using the given parameters $a=0.1$, $C=500$, and $\\epsilon=0.005$.\n$$\np_1 = a(1-2\\epsilon) + \\epsilon = 0.1(1 - 2 \\times 0.005) + 0.005 = 0.1(0.99) + 0.005 = 0.099 + 0.005 = 0.104\n$$\nSo, under $\\mathcal{H}_1$, $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(500, 0.104)$. The power is $\\Pr(X \\geq 6)$ for this distribution.\nThe expected value under $\\mathcal{H}_1$ is $\\mu_1 = C p_1 = 500 \\times 0.104 = 52$. The variance is $\\sigma_1^2 = C p_1 (1-p_1) = 52 \\times (1-0.104) = 52 \\times 0.896 = 46.592$.\nThe standard deviation is $\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{46.592} \\approx 6.826$.\nSince both $C p_1 = 52 > 5$ and $C (1-p_1) = 448 > 5$, we can use a normal approximation to the binomial distribution, with a continuity correction.\n$X \\approx \\text{Normal}(\\mu_1=52, \\sigma_1^2=46.592)$.\nThe power is $\\Pr(X \\geq 6)$, which is approximated by $\\Pr(Y \\geq 5.5)$ where $Y$ is the corresponding normal random variable. We standardize this variable:\n$$\n\\text{Power} = \\Pr(Y \\geq 5.5) = \\Pr\\left(\\frac{Y-\\mu_1}{\\sigma_1} \\geq \\frac{5.5 - 52}{6.826}\\right) = \\Pr\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{-46.5}{6.826}\\right) \\approx \\Pr(Z \\geq -6.812)\n$$\nwhere $Z$ is a standard normal random variable. The probability of a standard normal variable being greater than $-6.812$ is extremely close to $1$. Using exact binomial calculation tools yields a value of approximately $0.999999999999998$. Rounded to four significant figures, the power is $1.000$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the effect of increasing $C$ on statistical power. The power is given by $\\Pr_{\\mathcal{H}_1}(X \\geq k^{\\ast})$. For fixed $\\alpha$ and $\\epsilon$, increasing $C$ has two main effects:\n1.  The critical value $k^{\\ast}$ increases. The null distribution\n    $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, \\epsilon)$ has a mean $\\mu_0 = C\\epsilon$. To keep the right-tail probability $\\alpha$ constant, $k^{\\ast}$ must increase as $C$ increases. Roughly, $k^{\\ast}$ scales in proportion to $C$, staying a certain number of standard deviations above the mean $\\mu_0$. Specifically, $k^{\\ast} \\approx C\\epsilon + z_\\alpha \\sqrt{C\\epsilon(1-\\epsilon)}$, where $z_\\alpha$ is the standard normal quantile for $\\alpha$.\n2.  The alternative distribution $X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(C, p_1)$ with mean $\\mu_1 = C p_1$ also shifts to the right and becomes narrower relative to its mean. The separation between the means of the null and alternative distributions, $\\mu_1 - \\mu_0 = C(p_1 - \\epsilon) = C(a(1-2\\epsilon))$, grows linearly with $C$. However, their standard deviations, $\\sigma_0 = \\sqrt{C\\epsilon(1-\\epsilon)}$ and $\\sigma_1 = \\sqrt{Cp_1(1-p_1)}$, grow only with $\\sqrt{C}$.\nThe result is that the separation between the distributions, measured in units of standard deviations, increases proportionally to $\\sqrt{C}$. This increased separation drastically reduces the overlap between the two distributions. The alternative distribution becomes almost entirely concentrated to the right of the critical value $k^{\\ast}$, causing the Type II error rate $\\beta = \\Pr_{\\mathcal{H}_1}(X < k^{\\ast})$ to approach $0$, and consequently, the power $(1-\\beta)$ to approach $1$.\n\nIn summary, increasing the coverage $C$ enhances the ability to distinguish the true signal (allele fraction $a$) from the background noise (error rate $\\epsilon$), thus increasing the statistical power.\n\nThe calculated power for the given parameters is:\n$$\n\\text{Power} = \\Pr(X \\geq 6) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad X \\sim \\text{Binomial}(500, 0.104) = \\sum_{k=6}^{500} \\binom{500}{k} (0.104)^k (1-0.104)^{500-k}\n$$\nThis value is $0.999999...$, which rounds to $1.000$ at four significant figures.",
