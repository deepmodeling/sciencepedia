            "problem": "A clinical Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) report identifies a single-base duplication within a homopolymer run in a protein-coding gene. In clinical practice, laboratories must describe variants using the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature at genomic ($g.$), coding ($c.$), and protein ($p.$) levels. Foundational principles include the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), exon–intron gene structure, and HGVS rules that coding deoxyribonucleic acid numbering starts at the adenosine of the translation initiation codon ($c.1$ at the $A$ in the canonical $ATG$), proceeds across exons, and that small insertions and deletions in repetitive sequence are left-normalized to the most 5-prime position on the reference sequence. Reference transcript selection must prioritize a stable, curated, protein-coding transcript appropriate for clinical reporting (for example, a National Center for Biotechnology Information Reference Sequence (RefSeq) NM accession or a Locus Reference Genomic (LRG) mapping when available).\n\nConsider a gene on chromosome $17$ (Genome Reference Consortium Human build $38$). The gene is on the forward strand and has three exons with genomic coordinates:\n- Exon $1$: $g.430{,}100$ to $g.430{,}199$.\n- Exon $2$: $g.430{,}300$ to $g.430{,}449$.\n- Exon $3$: $g.430{,}600$ to $g.430{,}849$.\n\nThe coding sequence (CDS) for curated transcript $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$ starts at $g.430{,}130$ (within exon $1$) and ends at $g.430{,}820$ (within exon $3$). An alternative transcript $\\mathrm{NM\\_000002}$ exists with a different translation start at $g.430{,}135$, but both transcripts share the same exon coordinates and gene orientation.\n\nThe WGS pipeline reports a raw variant call $g.430{,}380dupA$ within exon $2$. The local forward-strand reference sequence from $g.430{,}374$ to $g.430{,}384$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Position } g.430{,}374\\text{ to }g.430{,}384: \\quad \\text{A A A A A A A G T C G}\n$$\nso there are seven consecutive adenosines from $g.430{,}374$ through $g.430{,}380$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using the foundational principles above, identify the appropriate transcript for clinical HGVS reporting and explain the implications for $c.$-level numbering.\n2. Apply HGVS left-normalization to the reported duplication in this homopolymer context and determine the left-normalized genomic description.\n3. Map the left-normalized genomic position to the coding coordinate for $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$ and construct the corresponding $c.$-level HGVS expression. Briefly indicate the conceptual $p.$-level consequence (frame-preserving or frameshifting), without requiring a specific amino acid sequence.\n4. Let $n$ denote the integer coding position used in the $c.$-level duplication after left-normalization for $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$. Compute $n$. Report only the integer value of $n$ as your final answer. No rounding is necessary; express your result as an exact integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and clinical genetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multi-step analysis involving transcript selection, variant normalization, and coordinate mapping, based on the provided gene structure and Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature rules.\n\nFirst, we address the selection of the appropriate transcript for clinical reporting (Task $1$). The problem provides two transcripts, $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$ and $\\mathrm{NM\\_000002}$. Clinical practice, as stated, requires the use of a stable, curated, protein-coding transcript. While both are RefSeq transcripts, subsequent tasks specifically direct the analysis to be performed on $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$ is selected as the reference transcript for this analysis. The implication for coding DNA ($c.$) level numbering is that the start of the numbering, $c.1$, corresponds to the adenosine ($A$) of the translation initiation codon ($ATG$). For $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$, the coding sequence (CDS) starts at genomic position $g.430{,}130$. Thus, $g.430{,}130$ is equivalent to $c.1$.\n\nSecond, we apply the HGVS left-normalization rule to the reported variant (Task $2$). The raw variant is given as $g.430{,}380dupA$. This variant occurs within a homopolymer run of seven consecutive adenosine bases, which the problem specifies spans from $g.430{,}374$ to $g.430{,}380$. The sequence is $\\text{A}_7$. A duplication of the adenosine at the 3'-most position ($g.430{,}380$) results in an allele with eight consecutive adenosines, $\\text{A}_8$. This resultant sequence is biologically indistinguishable from an allele where the duplication occurred at any other position within the homopolymer. The HGVS rules state that such variants in repetitive sequences must be \"left-normalized,\" meaning the variant is described at the most 5' (leftmost, or numerically smallest) possible coordinate. For the homopolymer run from $g.430{,}374$ to $g.430{,}380$, the most 5' position is $g.430{,}374$. Therefore, the left-normalized genomic description of the variant is $g.430{,}374dupA$.\n\nThird, we map this normalized genomic position to its corresponding coding DNA coordinate for transcript $\\mathrm{NM\\_000001}$ (Task $3$). The gene is on the forward strand, so CDS numbering increases with the genomic coordinates, accounting for introns. The normalized variant position, $g.430{,}374$, falls within exon $2$ (which spans $g.430{,}300$ to $g.430{,}449$). To find the coding position, we must calculate the number of coding bases that precede it.\n\n1.  Calculate the length of the coding sequence in exon $1$.\n    The CDS begins at $g.430{,}130$ within exon $1$ (which ends at $g.430{,}199$). The number of coding bases in exon $1$ is:\n    $$ L_1 = (g_{\\text{exon1\\_end}} - g_{\\text{CDS\\_start}}) + 1 $$\n    $$ L_1 = (430{,}199 - 430{,}130) + 1 = 69 + 1 = 70 \\text{ bases} $$\n    These bases correspond to positions $c.1$ through $c.70$.\n\n2.  Calculate the number of coding bases in exon $2$ up to the variant's position.\n    The CDS continues at the start of exon $2$, $g.430{,}300$. This position corresponds to coding position $c.71$. The normalized variant is at $g.430{,}374$. The number of coding bases from the start of exon $2$ up to and including the variant position is:\n    $$ L_2 = (g_{\\text{variant}} - g_{\\text{exon2\\_start}}) + 1 $$\n    $$ L_2 = (430{,}374 - 430{,}300) + 1 = 74 + 1 = 75 \\text{ bases} $$\n\n3.  Sum the contributions to find the final coding position, $n$.\n    The coding position of the variant is the sum of the coding length of the prior exon(s) and the offset within the current exon.\n    $$ n = L_1 + L_2 $$\n    $$ n = 70 + 75 = 145 $$\n    Thus, the genomic position $g.430{,}374$ corresponds to the coding position $c.145$.\n\nThe $c.$-level HGVS expression for the variant is therefore $c.145dupA$ (or more formally, $c.145dup$). This is a single-base duplication. Since the number of inserted bases ($1$) is not a multiple of three, this variant disrupts the translational reading frame. The conceptual consequence at the protein ($p.$) level is a **frameshift**.\n\nFourth, we identify the integer $n$ as requested (Task $4$). The problem defines $n$ as the integer coding position in the $c.$-level description of the left-normalized duplication. Based on our calculation, this value is $145$.",

            "solution": "The foundational principle in Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) coverage modeling is that, under uniform sampling, the expected number of reads aligning to a genomic interval is proportional to the amount of DNA present in that interval. For bulk samples, the amount of DNA per locus is proportional to the average copy number across cells. GC content introduces a multiplicative bias in coverage that can be modeled by a function $b(g)$ of the GC proportion $g$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian statistics as applied to medical genetics, specifically the ACMG/AMP framework for variant classification. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe core of this problem rests on Bayes' theorem, which provides a mathematical framework for updating the probability of a hypothesis in light of new evidence. In this context, the hypothesis is that a genetic variant is pathogenic.\n\nLet $D$ represent the event that the variant is pathogenic, and $\\neg D$ represent the event that the variant is benign (not pathogenic). The prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $P_0 = P(D) = 0.02$. The prior probability of the variant being benign is therefore $P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n\nIt is often more convenient to work with odds rather than probabilities. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring. The prior odds of pathogenicity, $O_{\\text{prior}}$, are:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(\\neg D)} = \\frac{P_0}{1 - P_0}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$\nO_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{1}{49}\n$$\nEvidence is incorporated into this framework using a likelihood ratio ($LR$). For a piece of evidence $E$, the likelihood ratio is defined as:\n$$\nLR = \\frac{P(E|D)}{P(E|\\neg D)}\n$$\nThis ratio quantifies how much more likely the observed evidence is if the variant is pathogenic compared to if it is benign. Bayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds, $O_{\\text{post}}$, are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio:\n$$\nO_{\\text{post}} = O_{\\text{prior}} \\times LR\n$$\nThe problem states that when multiple independent pieces of evidence are considered, their likelihood ratios are multiplied.
