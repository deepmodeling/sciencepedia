            "problem": "In human females, X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage-compensation mechanism in which one of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced in each cell early in embryogenesis. Under the null model of random X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), each progenitor cell independently inactivates the maternal or paternal X chromosome with equal probability, which can be modeled as identically distributed Bernoulli trials with success probability $1/2$. Consider a tissue in which clonal contributions from $N$ independent progenitor cells are equal, and sampling noise at the cell level is negligible compared to the progenitor bottleneck, so that the observed mosaic ratio reflects the fraction of progenitors that chose each X chromosome for inactivation.\n\nClinically, skewed XCI is often defined as at least an $80:20$ ratio. Assume that “exceeds $80:20$” means the observed fraction of cells expressing one parental X is greater than or equal to $0.8$ (equivalently, less than or equal to $0.2$), and that there is no post-inactivation selection. For $N = 20$ independent progenitor cells, use the binomial model to calculate the exact probability that the observed skew equals or exceeds $80:20$ purely by chance under the null of random XCI.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem to be solved. As per the instructions, the first step is to perform a rigorous validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Biological Process**: X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) in human females.\n- **Null Model**: Random XCI, where each progenitor cell independently inactivates the maternal or paternal X chromosome with equal probability. This is modeled as a series of identically distributed Bernoulli trials.\n- **Probability**: The probability of inactivating either the maternal or paternal X chromosome in a single trial is $p = 1/2$.\n- **Progenitor Cells**: A tissue develops from $N = 20$ independent progenitor cells.\n- **Mosaic Ratio Assumption**: The observed mosaic ratio in the tissue is assumed to be equal to the fraction of progenitors that chose each X chromosome for inactivation.\n- **Clinical Definition of Skew**: Skewed XCI is defined as an inactivation ratio of at least $80:20$. This is specified to mean that the fraction of cells expressing one parental X chromosome is greater than or equal to $0.8$ or less than or equal to $0.2$.\n- **Assumption**: No post-inactivation selection occurs.\n- **Objective**: Calculate the exact probability that the observed skew equals or exceeds the $80:20$ threshold purely by chance under the null model of random XCI.\n- **Required Format**: The answer must be a single reduced fraction.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in medical genetics and population genetics. The concept of X-chromosome inactivation, Lyon's hypothesis, and the modeling of random XCI using a binomial distribution are standard and fundamental principles in the field. The $80:20$ threshold is a commonly used, albeit not universally standardized, clinical benchmark for significant skew. The assumptions, such as no post-inactivation selection and the progenitor bottleneck being the primary source of variance, are standard simplifications for such a model.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-posed. It defines a clear stochastic process (a sequence of Bernoulli trials), provides all necessary parameters (number of trials $N=20$, success probability $p=1/2$), and specifies a precise condition (skew $\\ge 80:20$) for which a probability is to be calculated. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective and precise language. All terms are clearly defined within the context of the problem (e.g., the meaning of \"exceeds $80:20$\"). It is free of subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (Scientific Unsoundness, Non-Formalizable, Incomplete Setup, Unrealistic, Ill-Posed, Pseudo-Profound, Outside Scientific Verifiability).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the probability of observing skewed X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by chance in a tissue derived from $N=20$ progenitor cells, assuming a random inactivation process.\n\nLet $K$ be a random variable representing the number of progenitor cells out of the total $N=20$ that inactivate a specific parental X chromosome (e.g., the paternal X). Since each of the $N$ cells makes an independent choice with a constant probability $p=1/2$, the random variable $K$ follows a binomial distribution, denoted as $K \\sim B(n, p)$, where the number of trials is $n=N=20$ and the probability of success (inactivating the chosen parental X) is $p=1/2$.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nFor our specific case, this becomes:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^k \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20-k} = \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nSkewed XCI is defined as a ratio of at least $80:20$. This means the fraction of cells inactivating one parental X, which is $K/N$, satisfies either $K/N \\ge 0.8$ or $K/N \\le 0.2$. With $N=20$, we can convert these fractions into integer counts for $K$:\n1.  High skew: $\\frac{K}{20} \\ge 0.8 \\implies K \\ge 16$.\n2.  Low skew: $\\frac{K}{20} \\le 0.2 \\implies K \\le 4$.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability of this event, which is $P(K \\le 4 \\text{ or } K \\ge 16)$. Since the events $\\{K \\le 4\\}$ and $\\{K \\ge 16\\}$ are mutually exclusive, the total probability is the sum of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = P(K \\le 4) + P(K \\ge 16)$$\n\nWe can express these probabilities as sums of PMF values:\n$$P(K \\le 4) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = \\sum_{k=16}^{20} P(K=k) = \\sum_{k=16}^{20} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nFor a binomial distribution with $p=1/2$, the distribution of probabilities is symmetric around the mean $n/2 = 10$. This symmetry is a consequence of the identity $\\binom{n}{k} = \\binom{n}{n-k}$. Therefore, $P(K=k) = P(K=n-k)$.\nApplying this symmetry to our problem ($n=20$):\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = P(K=16) + P(K=17) + P(K=18) + P(K=19) + P(K=20)$$\n$$P(K \\ge 16) = P(K=4) + P(K=3) + P(K=2) + P(K=1) + P(K=0) = P(K \\le 4)$$\nThus, the total probability of skew is:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = 2 \\times P(K \\le 4) = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20}$$\n\nNow, we compute the sum of the binomial coefficients:\n$\\binom{20}{0} = 1$\n$\\binom{20}{1} = 20$\n$\\binom{20}{2} = \\frac{20 \\times 19}{2 \\times 1} = 190$\n$\\binom{20}{3} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 1140$\n$\\binom{20}{4} = \\frac{20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 4845$\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^{4} \\binom{20}{k} = 1 + 20 + 190 + 1140 + 4845 = 6196$$\n\nSubstituting this sum back into the probability expression:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = 2 \\times 6196 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{20} = \\frac{2 \\times 6196}{2^{20}} = \\frac{6196}{2^{19}}$$\n\nTo express this as a reduced fraction, we find the prime factorization of the numerator.\n$6196 = 4 \\times 1549 = 2^2 \\times 1549$. The number $1549$ is not divisible by small primes (e.g., $3, 5, 7, 11, ...$). The denominator is a power of $2$.\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = \\frac{2^2 \\times 1549}{2^{19}} = \\frac{1549}{2^{17}}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the value of the denominator:\n$2^{10} = 1024$\n$2^{7} = 128$\n$2^{17} = 2^{10} \\times 2^{7} = 1024 \\times 128 = 131072$.\n\nSo the exact probability is:\n$$P(\\text{skew}) = \\frac{1549}{131072}$$\nSince $1549$ is an odd number and the denominator is a power of $2$, this fraction is in its simplest (reduced) form.",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the steady-state serum CK concentration, $C$, for a manifesting carrier and then calculate its value.\n\nFirst, we determine the fraction of dystrophin-deficient domains, $f$. The problem states that the ratio of nuclei with the mutant X active to those with the wild-type X active is $85:15$. The fraction $f$ is the number of mutant-active nuclei divided by the total number of nuclei.\n$$f = \\frac{85}{85 + 15} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$$\nConsequently, the fraction of normal, dystrophin-positive domains is $1-f = 1-0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe model states that the total tissue is a mosaic composed of two populations of sarcolemmal domains: normal domains with a CK leakage rate of $r_n$ and deficient domains with a leakage rate of $r_m$. The average CK leakage rate for the entire muscle mass, $\\bar{r}$, is the weighted average of the rates from these two populations, where the weights are their respective fractions.\n$$\\bar{r} = (1-f) \\cdot r_n + f \\cdot r_m$$\n\nWe are given the relationship $r_m = \\lambda r_n$. Substituting this into the expression for the average leakage rate:\n$$\\bar{r} = (1-f) r_n + f (\\lambda r_n)$$\nFactoring out the common term $r_n$:\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( (1-f) + f\\lambda \\right)$$\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( 1 - f + f\\lambda \\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\\bar{r} = r_n \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the steady-state serum CK concentration, $C$, is proportional to the average leakage rate, $\\bar{r}$. Let $k$ be the constant of proportionality, which encapsulates factors such as total muscle mass and the clearance rate of CK from the serum.\n$$C = k \\bar{r}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\bar{r}$:\n$$C = k r_n \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n\nTo determine the term $k r_n$, we use the baseline condition for a healthy female. In this case, there are no mutant alleles, so $f=0$. The corresponding serum CK concentration is $C_b$.\n$$C_b = k r_n \\left( 1 + (0)(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\n$$C_b = k r_n (1)$$\n$$C_b = k r_n$$\nThis result is biologically intuitive: the baseline CK concentration is proportional to the baseline leakage rate from healthy muscle tissue.\n\nNow, we substitute $C_b$ for $k r_n$ in the general expression for $C$:\n$$C = C_b \\left( 1 + f(\\lambda - 1) \\right)$$\nThis is the final derived expression for the carrier's serum CK concentration in terms of the baseline concentration $C_b$, the fraction of deficient cells $f$, and the membrane fragility multiplier $\\lambda$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value for $C$ using the given parameters:\n- $C_b = 100\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$\n- $f = 0.85$\n- $\\lambda = 15$\n\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 0.85 (15 - 1) \\right)$$\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 0.85 \\cdot 14 \\right)$$\nThe product $0.85 \\times 14$ is calculated:\n$$0.85 \\times 14 = 11.9$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $C$:\n$$C = 100 \\left( 1 + 11.9 \\right)$$\n$$C = 100 (12.9)$$\n$$C = 1290\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value, $1290$, is already expressed with three significant figures (the trailing zero is not significant in this context). In scientific notation, this is $1.29 \\times 10^3$.

A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe goal is to determine the expected Factor VIII activity in the patient as a fraction of a non-carrier's activity. Let $A_{patient}$ be the patient's activity and $A_{normal}$ be the reference normal activity. Based on the given information, activity is proportional to the total production rate, $P$. Therefore, the desired fractional activity is the ratio of the production rates:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{patient}}{A_{normal}} = \\frac{P_{patient}}{P_{normal}}\n$$\nLet's model the total production in a normal individual, $P_{normal}$. The problem defines $\\alpha$ as the fraction of this total production originating from LSECs. Thus, we can partition $P_{normal}$ into two components:\n- Production from LSECs in a normal individual: $P_{LSEC, normal} = \\alpha P_{normal}$.\n- Production from extrahepatic sources in a normal individual: $P_{extra, normal} = (1-\\alpha) P_{normal}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total production in the heterozygous patient, $P_{patient}$. Production is the sum of contributions from LSECs and extrahepatic sources.\n$$\nP_{patient} = P_{LSEC, patient} + P_{extra, patient}\n$$\nIn the patient's LSECs, XCI is skewed such that only a fraction $0.20$ of cells express the normal allele. The remaining fraction, $0.80$, expresses the loss-of-function allele and produces no Factor VIII. Therefore, the production from LSECs in the patient is $0.20$ times the production from LSECs in a normal individual:\n$$\nP_{LSEC, patient} = 0.20 \\cdot P_{LSEC, normal} = 0.20 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot P_{normal}\n$$\nIn the patient's extrahepatic sources, XCI is random. This means a fraction $0.50$ of cells express the normal allele, and $0.50$ express the mutant allele. The production from these sources is thus $0.50$ times the production from the same sources in a normal individual:\n$$\nP_{extra, patient} = 0.50 \\cdot P_{extra, normal} = 0.50 \\cdot (1-\\alpha) \\cdot P_{normal}\n$$\nThe patient's total production, $P_{patient}$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$\nP_{patient} = (0.20 \\cdot \\alpha \\cdot P_{normal}) + (0.50 \\cdot (1-\\alpha) \\cdot P_{normal})\n$$\nFactoring out $P_{normal}$ gives:\n$$\nP_{patient} = [0.20\\alpha + 0.50(1-\\alpha)] \\cdot P_{normal}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression within the brackets provides the relationship between $P_{patient}$ and $P_{normal}$:\n$$\nP_{patient} = [0.20\\alpha + 0.50 - 0.50\\alpha] \\cdot P_{normal} = (0.50 - 0.30\\alpha) \\cdot P_{normal}\n$$\nThe expression for the patient's Factor VIII activity as a fraction of normal, which we denote as $F(\\alpha)$, is the ratio $P_{patient} / P_{normal}$:\n$$\nF(\\alpha) = \\frac{P_{patient}}{P_{normal}} = 0.50 - 0.30\\alpha\n$$\nThis is the derived expression in terms of $\\alpha$.\n\nTo find the lower and upper bounds of this activity, we use the given range for $\\alpha$, which is $[0.70, 0.90]$. The function $F(\\alpha)$ is a linear function with a negative slope ($-0.30$), indicating it is monotonically decreasing. Consequently, the minimum value of $F(\\alpha)$ will occur at the maximum value of $\\alpha$, and vice versa.\n\nThe upper bound of the activity, $F_{upper}$, occurs at $\\alpha = 0.70$:\n$$\nF_{upper} = F(0.70) = 0.50 - 0.30(0.70) = 0.50 - 0.21 = 0.29\n$$\nThe lower bound of the activity, $F_{lower}$, occurs at $\\alpha = 0.90$:\n$$\nF_{lower} = F(0.90) = 0.50 - 0.30(0.90) = 0.50 - 0.27 = 0.23\n$$\nThe problem requires that these decimal fractions be rounded to three significant figures.\n- The upper bound, $0.29$, is rounded to $0.290$.\n- The lower bound, $0.23$, is rounded to $0.230$.\n\nThus, the range for the expected Factor VIII activity is $[0.230, 0.290]$ of normal.",
