            "problem": "Whole-Genome Bisulfite Sequencing (WGBS) quantifies the fraction of methylated cytosines at specific genomic regions, yielding methylation proportions between $0$ and $1$. In mammalian cells, promoter methylation is generally associated with reduced transcription initiation, while gene body methylation is often associated with ongoing transcriptional elongation. Consider WGBS-derived averages for a cohort of tumor suppressor genes measured in a single tumor sample: average promoter methylation $m_{\\mathrm{prom}}=0.15$ and average gene body methylation $m_{\\mathrm{body}}=0.65$. Define a dimensionless differential methylation index that captures the direction and magnitude of the imbalance between gene body and promoter methylation subject to the following axioms: it must (i) return $0$ when $m_{\\mathrm{body}}=m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$, (ii) be strictly increasing in $m_{\\mathrm{body}}$ and strictly decreasing in $m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$, (iii) be bounded between $-1$ and $1$, with positive values indicating greater methylation in gene bodies than in promoters and negative values indicating the opposite, and (iv) depend only on the pair $\\left(m_{\\mathrm{body}},m_{\\mathrm{prom}}\\right)$ via a homogeneous, scale-free contrast of the two magnitudes. Derive the simplest analytic expression that satisfies these axioms, compute its value for the given data, and, based on established epigenetic principles, briefly state whether the result is more consistent with promoter-driven epigenetic silencing or with transcriptionally active tumor suppressors in this sample. Round your computed index to four significant figures and report it as a pure number without units.",
            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to find the simplest analytic expression for an index $I(m_{\\mathrm{body}}, m_{\\mathrm{prom}})$ that satisfies the four given axioms.\n\nAxiom (iv) is the most constraining. It requires the index to be a \"homogeneous, scale-free contrast\". A scale-free function of two variables $x$ and $y$ is a function that is homogeneous of degree $0$, meaning $f(\\lambda x, \\lambda y) = \\lambda^0 f(x, y) = f(x, y)$ for any scaling factor $\\lambda > 0$. Such functions typically depend on the ratio of the variables. The simplest way to construct a contrast between two positive quantities $a$ and $b$ that is also scale-free and normalized is the normalized difference. We propose the following form for the index:\n$$\nI(m_{\\mathrm{body}}, m_{\\mathrm{prom}}) = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}{m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}\n$$\nThis expression is arguably the simplest non-trivial analytic function that meets the structural requirement of a scale-free contrast. We must verify that it satisfies all four axioms.\n\n1.  **Axiom (i):** If $m_{\\mathrm{body}} = m_{\\mathrm{prom}} = m$, then:\n    $$\n    I(m, m) = \\frac{m - m}{m + m} = \\frac{0}{2m} = 0\n    $$\n    This holds for any $m > 0$. If $m_{\\mathrm{body}}=m_{\\mathrm{prom}}=0$, the expression is indeterminate, but the natural limit is $0$. Thus, the axiom is satisfied.\n\n2.  **Axiom (ii):** We compute the partial derivatives.\n    -   With respect to $m_{\\mathrm{body}}$:\n        $$\n        \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial m_{\\mathrm{body}}} = \\frac{(1)(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}) - (m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}})(1)}{(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}})^2} = \\frac{2m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}{(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}})^2}\n        $$\n        Since methylation proportions are non-negative ($0 \\le m_{\\mathrm{prom}} \\le 1$), and the denominator is a squared term (hence non-negative), this derivative is $\\ge 0$. It is strictly positive for $m_{\\mathrm{prom}} > 0$, a condition which is biologically certain for an average over a cohort of genes.\n    -   With respect to $m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$:\n        $$\n        \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial m_{\\mathrm{prom}}} = \\frac{(-1)(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}) - (m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}})(1)}{(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}})^2} = \\frac{-2m_{\\mathrm{body}}}{(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}})^2}\n        $$\n        Similarly, for $m_{\\mathrm{body}} > 0$, this derivative is strictly negative. Both conditions of Axiom (ii) are satisfied.\n\n3.  **Axiom (iii):** Since $m_{\\mathrm{body}} \\ge 0$ and $m_{\\mathrm{prom}} \\ge 0$, by the triangle inequality, $|m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}| \\le m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$. Therefore:\n    $$\n    |I| = \\left|\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}{m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}\\right| = \\frac{|m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}|}{m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}} \\le 1\n    $$\n    This confirms the index is bounded between $-1$ and $1$. The sign of $I$ is determined by the sign of the numerator, $m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$. Thus, $I > 0$ if $m_{\\mathrm{body}} > m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$ and $I < 0$ if $m_{\\mathrm{body}} < m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$. This axiom is satisfied.\n\n4.  **Axiom (iv):** We test for scale-invariance (homogeneity of degree $0$). Let $\\lambda > 0$ be a scaling factor:\n    $$\n    I(\\lambda m_{\\mathrm{body}}, \\lambda m_{\\mathrm{prom}}) = \\frac{\\lambda m_{\\mathrm{body}} - \\lambda m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}{\\lambda m_{\\mathrm{body}} + \\lambda m_{\\mathrm{prom}}} = \\frac{\\lambda(m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}})}{\\lambda(m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}})} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{body}} - m_{\\mathrm{prom}}}{m_{\\mathrm{body}} + m_{\\mathrm{prom}}} = I(m_{\\mathrm{body}}, m_{\\mathrm{prom}})\n    $$\n    The index is indeed a homogeneous function of degree $0$ and thus is a scale-free contrast. This axiom is satisfied.\n\nHaving confirmed the validity of the expression, we proceed to compute its value for the given data.\n\n### Calculation\nGiven $m_{\\mathrm{prom}} = 0.15$ and $m_{\\mathrm{body}} = 0.65$, we substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nI = \\frac{0.65 - 0.15}{0.65 + 0.15} = \\frac{0.50}{0.80} = \\frac{5}{8} = 0.625\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures.\n$$\nI = 0.6250\n$$\n\n### Interpretation\nThe computed index is $I = 0.6250$. This is a positive value, indicating that gene body methylation is substantially greater than promoter methylation ($m_{\\mathrm{body}} > m_{\\mathrm{prom}}$). Specifically, the data show low promoter methylation ($m_{\\mathrm{prom}} = 0.15$) and high gene body methylation ($m_{\\mathrm{body}} = 0.65$).\n\nIn the context of epigenetic regulation, particularly for tumor suppressor genes, silencing is classically driven by hypermethylation of the promoter region. Conversely, a state of low promoter methylation is permissive for transcription, and high gene body methylation is often correlated with active transcriptional elongation.\n\nTherefore, the observed methylation pattern and the resulting positive index are consistent with the tumor suppressor genes being in a transcriptionally active state, not a state of promoter-driven epigenetic silencing.",

            "problem": "A diploid human locus under Genomic Imprinting (GI) is regulated by an Imprinting Control Region (ICR). In healthy somatic cells, the ICR is methylated on exactly one parental allele and unmethylated on the other allele, yielding approximately $50\\%$ methylation by bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) in a bulk sample. For this locus, methylation at the ICR silences the associated allele, whereas an unmethylated ICR permits transcription. Assume that in each cell each allele’s ICR methylation state is binary (fully methylated or unmethylated), that there is no copy number variation, and that each unmethylated allele produces exactly one unit of transcript while a methylated allele produces zero.\n\nA patient sample shows $80\\%$ methylation at the same ICR by BS-seq. Assume this $80\\%$ arises from a mixture of two cellular states: a normal imprinted state with one methylated and one unmethylated allele per cell, and a pathologic hypermethylated state with both alleles methylated per cell.

            "solution": "Begin with the core definitions:\n\n- In a normally imprinted diploid cell at this locus, one allele’s Imprinting Control Region (ICR) is methylated and the other is unmethylated. Therefore, in such a cell, the ICR methylation fraction is $0.5$ (one methylated allele out of two).\n- In a pathologic hypermethylated cell at this locus, both alleles are methylated. Therefore, in such a cell, the ICR methylation fraction is $1.0$.\n- Bulk bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) reports the average methylation across all alleles and cells, which under a two-state mixture model is a convex combination of the per-state methylation fractions, weighted by their cellular fractions.\n- Transcriptional output per cell is determined additively by allelic states: an unmethylated ICR allele contributes $1$ unit and a methylated ICR allele contributes $0$ units. Thus, a normal imprinted cell produces $1$ unit (one unmethylated allele), while a hypermethylated cell produces $0$ units (both alleles methylated).\n- The allelic methylation imbalance index is defined as $I \\equiv f$, the fraction of cells in the hypermethylated state.\n\nLet $f$ denote the fraction of hypermethylated cells and $1 - f$ the fraction of normal imprinted cells. The bulk methylation fraction $M_{\\text{bulk}}$ observed by bisulfite sequencing is then\n$$\nM_{\\text{bulk}} = f \\cdot 1 + (1 - f) \\cdot 0.5.\n$$\nWe are given $M_{\\text{bulk}} = 0.8$.

A normal imprinted cell produces $1$ unit, and a hypermethylated cell produces $0$ units, so the average expression per cell is\n$$\nE_{\\text{avg}} = (1 - f) \\cdot 1 + f \\cdot 0 = 1 - f.\n$$\nNormalize this by the normal monoallelic state (which is already $1$ unit), so the normalized expected average expression is simply\n$$\n\\tilde{E} = 1 - f = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4.\n$$\n\nThus, using the methylation imbalance inferred from the BS-seq measurement, the predicted expected average transcript output per cell, normalized to the normal monoallelic state, is $0.4$.",

            "problem": "A research group is mapping enhancer states in an inflammatory disease cohort using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). They quantify the enhancer-associated histone modifications H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) and H3 lysine 4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) as normalized read density in counts per million mapped reads (CPM). Biologically, H3K27ac is enriched at active enhancers, whereas H3K4me1 marks enhancer priming. For a classification task, they propose constructing a single scalar “activity score” that increases from repressed to poised to active enhancers, and then choosing quantitative thresholds on this score to delineate the three states.\n\nAssume the following empirically measured and widely used modeling assumptions:\n- Genome-wide, each mark is standardized to a $z$-score using its mean and standard deviation across enhancers: $z = (x - \\mu)/\\sigma$.\n- Within each enhancer state (active, poised, repressed), the joint distribution of the $z$-scores for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 is approximately Gaussian with an isotropic covariance matrix and similar variance across classes, and the class priors are approximately equal in this disease cohort.\n\nFrom a labeled training set of enhancers, the mean $z$-score vectors for each state are estimated as:\n- Repressed mean vector $m_{R} = \\left( -0.8,\\,-1.0 \\right)$,\n- Poised mean vector $m_{P} = \\left( 0.2,\\,1.8 \\right)$,\n- Active mean vector $m_{A} = \\left( 2.8,\\,2.3 \\right)$,\n\nwhere each vector is ordered as $\\left( z_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, z_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} \\right)$. The proposed one-dimensional “activity axis” is defined biologically and statistically as the vector from repressed to active mean, i.e., the difference $m_{A} - m_{R}$.\n\nFor a specific enhancer in a patient sample, the observed normalized signals are:\n- H3K27ac $x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 5.2$,\n- H3K4me1 $x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 6.3$,\n\nwith genome-wide normalization parameters:\n- H3K27ac mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 3.0$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = 2.0$,\n- H3K4me1 mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 4.5$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = 1.5$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the Gaussian equal-covariance, equal-prior modeling assumption, do the following:\n- Construct a scalar activity score $s$ by projecting the enhancer’s two-dimensional $z$-score vector onto the activity axis defined by $m_{A} - m_{R}$.\n- Using only first principles under the stated assumptions, justify how two decision thresholds on $s$ can be placed to separate repressed from poised and poised from active regions.\n- Compute the scalar activity score $s$ for the given enhancer.\n\nReport only the numerical value of $s$ as a dimensionless quantity, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "First, the raw Chromatin Immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) signals for the given enhancer are converted into standard scores, or $z$-scores. The $z$-score for a variable is calculated as $z = (x - \\mu)/\\sigma$, where $x$ is the observed value, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nThe observed signals are given as a vector $x = (x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (5.2,\\, 6.3)$.\nThe genome-wide means are given as a vector $\\mu = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (3.0,\\, 4.5)$.\nThe genome-wide standard deviations are given as a vector $\\sigma = (\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}},\\, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}) = (2.0,\\, 1.5)$.\n\nThe $z$-score for the H3K27ac mark is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K27ac}}} = \\frac{5.2 - 3.0}{2.0} = \\frac{2.2}{2.0} = 1.1$$\n\nThe $z$-score for the H3K4me1 mark is:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{H3K4me1}}} = \\frac{6.3 - 4.5}{1.5} = \\frac{1.8}{1.5} = 1.2$$\n\nThus, the two-dimensional $z$-score vector for the enhancer is $z = (1.1,\\, 1.2)$.\n\nNext, we define the \"activity axis\". The problem states this axis is the vector from the mean of the repressed state to the mean of the active state. The mean $z$-score vectors for these states are given as $m_{R} = (-0.8,\\, -1.0)$ and $m_{A} = (2.8,\\, 2.3)$.\n\nThe activity axis vector, denoted by $v$, is therefore:\n$$v = m_{A} - m_{R} = (2.8 - (-0.8),\\, 2.3 - (-1.0)) = (3.6,\\, 3.3)$$\n\nThe scalar activity score, $s$, is obtained by projecting the enhancer's $z$-score vector onto this activity axis. The standard definition of this scalar projection in this context is the dot product of the data vector $z$ and the direction vector $v$:\n$$s = z \\cdot v$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated values of $z$ and $v$:\n$$s = (1.1,\\, 1.2) \\cdot (3.6,\\, 3.3) = (1.1)(3.6) + (1.2)(3.3) = 3.96 + 3.96 = 7.92$$\n\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $s = 7.920$.\n\nFinally, we must justify a method for placing two decision thresholds on the score $s$ to separate the three enhancer states: repressed, poised, and active. The justification stems from the principles of Bayesian decision theory and, more specifically, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), for which the problem's assumptions are tailor-made.\n\nThe problem assumes that for each of the three classes (Repressed $R$, Poised $P$, Active $A$), the joint distribution of $z$-scores is a multivariate Gaussian, with an isotropic covariance matrix that is the same for all classes (i.e., $\\Sigma_R = \\Sigma_P = \\Sigma_A = \\sigma_{iso}^2 I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\sigma_{iso}^2$ is a constant variance). It also assumes that the prior probabilities of the classes are equal, $P(R) = P(P) = P(A)$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the Bayes optimal discriminant function simplifies significantly. To classify a new point $z$, we assign it to the class $k \\in \\{R, P, A\\}$ that has the maximum posterior probability, $P(k|z)$. By Bayes' theorem, $P(k|z) \\propto p(z|k)P(k)$. Since the priors $P(k)$ are equal, this is equivalent to maximizing the class-conditional likelihood $p(z|k)$. Maximizing $p(z|k)$ is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which, for a Gaussian distribution with covariance $\\sigma_{iso}^2 I$, is equivalent to minimizing the squared Euclidean distance $\\|z - m_k\\|^2$.\n\nThe decision boundary between any two classes, say class $i$ and class $j$, is the set of points $z$ that are equidistant from the two class means, $m_i$ and $m_j$:\n$$\\|z - m_i\\|^2 = \\|z - m_j\\|^2$$\nExpanding this equation gives:\n$$(z - m_i) \\cdot (z - m_i) = (z - m_j) \\cdot (z - m_j)$$\n$$\\|z\\|^2 - 2 z \\cdot m_i + \\|m_i\\|^2 = \\|z\\|^2 - 2 z \\cdot m_j + \\|m_j\\|^2$$\n$$2 z \\cdot (m_j - m_i) = \\|m_j\\|^2 - \\|m_i\\|^2$$\nThis equation defines a hyperplane (a line in this $2$D case) that is perpendicular to the vector connecting the two class means, $m_j - m_i$.\n\nThe problem simplifies the $2$D classification problem to a $1$D problem by projecting all data onto the single activity axis $v = m_A - m_R$. The score $s = z \\cdot v$ represents the coordinate of the point $z$ in this new $1$D space. A linear projection of a Gaussian distribution is also a Gaussian distribution. Therefore, in the $1$D space of the score $s$, each class is represented by a Gaussian distribution with an equal variance. The means of these $1$D distributions are the projections of the original means: $s_R = m_R \\cdot v$, $s_P = m_P \\cdot v$, and $s_A = m_A \\cdot v$.\n\nTo separate two $1$D Gaussian distributions with equal variance and equal priors, the optimal decision point (threshold) is simply the midpoint between their means.\nTherefore, the threshold $t_{RP}$ to separate the repressed and poised states is the midpoint of their projected means:\n$$t_{RP} = \\frac{s_R + s_P}{2} = \\frac{m_R \\cdot v + m_P \\cdot v}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(m_R + m_P) \\cdot v$$\nSimilarly, the threshold $t_{PA}$ to separate the poised and active states is the midpoint of their projected means:\n$$t_{PA} = \\frac{s_P + s_A}{2} = \\frac{m_P \\cdot v + m_A \\cdot v}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}(m_P + m_A) \\cdot v$$\n\nThis provides a principled, statistically optimal method (under the given assumptions) for placing two thresholds on the scalar score $s$ to define decision boundaries that separate the three enhancer states. An enhancer with score $s$ would be classified as repressed if $s < t_{RP}$, poised if $t_{RP} \\le s < t_{PA}$, and active if $s \\ge t_{PA}$.",
