            "problem": "A cohort study sought to estimate the causal effect of coffee consumption on cancer incidence using Mendelian randomization (MR). The investigators selected a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in a bitter taste receptor gene as an instrumental variable (IV) for coffee intake. Let $G$ denote the genotype at this SNP, $E$ the coffee intake, $Y$ the cancer outcome, and $U$ unmeasured confounders. Participants were unrelated adults drawn from mixed continental ancestries, and the primary analyses adjusted for age and sex only. The authors claim that $G$ is a valid instrument for $E$ in estimating the causal effect of $E$ on $Y$.\n\nWhich of the following critiques identify likely threats to the validity of using $G$ as an instrument in this setting?\n\nA. The SNP may influence other dietary behaviors and physiological pathways that affect cancer risk independently of coffee intake, violating the requirement that $G$ affects $Y$ only through $E$.\n\nB.

If the SNP has only a very small effect on coffee intake, then instrument strength is weak, which can bias the causal estimate in finite samples toward the confounded observational association.\n\nD. Because alleles are randomly assigned at conception, $G$ is necessarily independent of all confounders, so population stratification cannot bias the estimate.\n\nE. Individuals may respond heterogeneously to the bitter-taste genotype; some reduce coffee, while others add sugar and do not reduce or may increase intake. This heterogeneity necessarily violates the monotonicity condition required to identify a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE).",
            "solution": "To evaluate the validity of using a genetic variant as an instrumental variable (IV) within Mendelian randomization (MR), one applies the core IV assumptions in terms of the variables $G$ (genotype), $E$ (exposure, here coffee intake), $Y$ (outcome, here cancer incidence), and $U$ (unmeasured confounders):\n\n- Relevance: $G$ must causally influence $E$, formally $G \\not\\!\\perp E$ or, equivalently, $\\mathbb{E}[E \\mid G]$ differs across levels of $G$.\n- Independence: $G \\perp U$, meaning the genotype is independent of all unmeasured confounders of $E$ and $Y$, conditional on appropriate design and covariates.\n- Exclusion restriction: $G$ affects $Y$ only through $E$, expressed as $G \\perp Y \\mid E, U$ in a causal directed acyclic graph framework.\n- For certain causal parameter interpretations (such as the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) under a nonparametric model), a monotonicity condition is invoked: the effect of $G$ on $E$ is in the same direction for all individuals (no “defiers”), e.g., $\\Delta E(G{=}1) \\ge 0$ for every individual if $G{=}1$ is the allele expected to increase $E$.\n\nIn the present setting, $G$ is a SNP in a bitter taste receptor gene (for example, in the TAS2R family). Such receptors have documented effects on perceived bitterness, which plausibly modifies beverage choices including coffee. However, there are several biological and epidemiological considerations that can threaten the IV assumptions:\n\n- Horizontal pleiotropy: bitter taste receptor variants may influence a range of dietary behaviors beyond coffee, including consumption of cruciferous vegetables, alcohol, and other bitter or sweet foods, and may even have extraoral expression influencing gastrointestinal or airway physiology. If any of these pathways affect cancer independent of coffee intake, the exclusion restriction is violated.\n- Population stratification: allele frequencies of $G$, coffee consumption patterns, and baseline cancer risks can all differ across ancestry groups. Without adequate control for genetic ancestry (for example, principal components of genome-wide genotype data), the independence condition $G \\perp U$ is not guaranteed at the sample level.\n- Weak instrument: taste receptor variants often explain a very small proportion of variance in coffee intake. Weak instruments inflate variance and, in finite samples with residual confounding, can bias ratio estimates toward the confounded observational association.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. The statement targets the exclusion restriction. If $G$ alters $Y$ through pathways other than $E$ (coffee intake), then $G \\not\\perp Y \\mid E, U$. Bitter taste receptor SNPs plausibly influence multiple dietary preferences and possibly physiological processes that may bear on cancer risk independently of coffee (horizontal pleiotropy). This is a credible and common concern in Mendelian randomization. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This statement targets the independence assumption. Although, in principle, Mendelian assortment makes $G$ independent of environmental confounders at conception, in practice $G \\perp U$ can be violated in samples with mixed ancestries if one does not control adequately for genetic ancestry, because $G$, $E$, and $Y$ can all vary by ancestry for reasons unrelated to the causal question. Thus, population stratification can induce $G$–$U$ associations. Verdict — Correct.\n\nC. This statement addresses the relevance assumption and finite-sample bias of weak instruments. When the effect of $G$ on $E$ is small, tests and estimators based on the IV ratio or two-stage least squares can suffer from weak instrument bias, pulling estimates toward the confounded observational association in finite samples. This is a well-known threat when using behavioral proxies such as taste perception. Verdict — Correct.\n\nD. This statement overstates the protection afforded by Mendelian assortment. While meiosis randomizes alleles within families, in a heterogeneous sample $G \\perp U$ can fail due to population stratification, assortative mating, or dynastic effects (for example, parental genotypes shaping the household environment). Therefore, it is incorrect to claim that population stratification cannot bias the estimate. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. This statement invokes the monotonicity condition. Heterogeneous responses (some individuals reduce coffee, others do not change) do not by themselves violate monotonicity; monotonicity requires ruling out “defiers,” individuals for whom the causal effect of $G$ on $E$ is in the opposite direction from the majority. The scenario described (some add sugar to maintain intake) is compatible with a weak or null effect in some people and a reduction in others, which preserves monotonicity. Moreover, the primary threats to IV validity here are exclusion, independence, and relevance; monotonicity is needed for a specific LATE interpretation but its violation is neither necessary nor clearly established by the stated behavior. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the likely threats to the validity of the bitter taste SNP as an instrument in this study are the potential violation of the exclusion restriction due to horizontal pleiotropy (Option A), violation of independence via population stratification (Option B), and weak instrument concerns (Option C).",
