            "problem": "A genome-wide association study (GWAS) quality-control pipeline requires computing the minor allele frequency and checking consistency with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) expectations. Consider a single-nucleotide polymorphism with two alleles, denoted by $A$ and $a$, genotyped in $N$ unrelated individuals drawn from a large, randomly mating population. In a sample of $N = 1000$ individuals, the observed genotype counts are $n_{AA} = 540$, $n_{Aa} = 420$, and $n_{aa} = 40$.\n\nUsing only core definitions from population genetics and Mendelian segregation, proceed as follows:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part analysis of genotype data from a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based on the principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The analysis proceeds by first deriving the formula for allele frequency, then deriving the HWE principle for genotype frequencies, and finally applying these to the provided data.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Minor Allele Frequency Expression\n\nThe first task is to express the sample minor allele frequency, $p$, for allele $a$ in terms of the observed genotype counts $n_{AA}$, $n_{Aa}$, $n_{aa}$, and the total sample size $N$.\n\nThe definition of allele frequency is the total number of copies of that allele in a population sample divided by the total number of all allele copies for that gene. Since humans are diploid organisms, each individual carries two alleles for any autosomal gene.\n\nGiven a sample of $N$ individuals, the total number of alleles in the sample is $2N$. The problem states that the genotype counts are $n_{AA}$ for genotype $AA$, $n_{Aa}$ for genotype $Aa$, and $n_{aa}$ for genotype $aa$. The total number of individuals is the sum of these counts:\n$$N = n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa}$$\n\nThe allele $a$ is carried by individuals with genotypes $Aa$ and $aa$.\n- Each individual with genotype $Aa$ carries one copy of the allele $a$. Thus, the total number of $a$ alleles from heterozygotes is $1 \\times n_{Aa} = n_{Aa}$.\n- Each individual with genotype $aa$ carries two copies of the allele $a$. Thus, the total number of $a$ alleles from homozygotes is $2 \\times n_{aa}$.\n\nThe total count of allele $a$ in the sample, let's call it $C_a$, is the sum of copies from both genotype groups:\n$$C_a = n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}$$\n\nThe frequency of allele $a$, denoted by $p$, is therefore the ratio of the total count of allele $a$ to the total number of all alleles in the sample ($2N$):\n$$p = \\frac{C_a}{2N} = \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{2N}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N$ in terms of the genotype counts yields the full expression requested:\n$$p = \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{2(n_{AA} + n_{Aa} + n_{aa})}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of Expected Genotype Frequencies under HWE\n\nThe second task is to derive the expected genotype frequencies for $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ under the assumptions of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium. The core assumptions are a large, randomly mating population with no evolutionary influences such as mutation, migration, or natural selection.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of allele $a$ and $q$ be the frequency of allele $A$ in the population's gene pool. Since these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\nUnder the assumption of random mating, the formation of genotypes for the next generation can be modeled as the random union of gametes (sperm and eggs) drawn from this gene pool. The frequency of gametes carrying allele $a$ is $p$, and the frequency of gametes carrying allele $A$ is $q$.\n\nThe probability of an offspring receiving a specific genotype is determined by the product of the frequencies of the alleles contributed by the two gametes that form the zygote.\n\n- The expected frequency of the homozygous genotype $AA$, denoted $P(AA)$, is the probability that a gamete carrying $A$ combines with another gamete carrying $A$. This probability is:\n  $$P(AA) = q \\times q = q^2$$\n\n- The expected frequency of the homozygous genotype $aa$, denoted $P(aa)$, is the probability that a gamete carrying $a$ combines with another gamete carrying $a$. This probability is:\n  $$P(aa) = p \\times p = p^2$$\n\n- The expected frequency of the heterozygous genotype $Aa$, denoted $P(Aa)$, can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n  1. A gamete carrying $A$ combines with a gamete carrying $a$. The probability of this is $q \\times p$.\n  2. A gamete carrying $a$ combines with a gamete carrying $A$. The probability of this is $p \\times q$.\n  The total probability for the heterozygous genotype is the sum of these two probabilities:\n  $$P(Aa) = (q \\times p) + (p \\times q) = 2pq$$\n\nThus, the expected genotype frequencies under HWE are:\n$$P(AA) = q^2$$\n$$P(Aa) = 2pq$$\n$$P(aa) = p^2$$\nAs a verification, the sum of these frequencies is $(q+p)^2 = 1^2 = 1$, as expected. This completes the second part.\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation of Expected Frequencies\n\nThe final task is to compute the numerical values for these expected frequencies using the provided data and round them to $4$ significant figures.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the sample allele frequencies $p$ and $q$ from the observed genotype counts: $N = 1000$, $n_{AA} = 540$, $n_{Aa} = 420$, and $n_{aa} = 40$. Note that $540+420+40 = 1000$, so the counts are consistent.\n\nUsing the formula from Part 1 for the frequency of allele $a$:\n$$p = \\frac{n_{Aa} + 2n_{aa}}{2N} = \\frac{420 + 2(40)}{2(1000)} = \\frac{420 + 80}{2000} = \\frac{500}{2000} = 0.25$$\nThe frequency of allele $A$, denoted by $q$, can be calculated similarly:\n$$q = \\frac{2n_{AA} + n_{Aa}}{2N} = \\frac{2(540) + 420}{2(1000)} = \\frac{1080 + 420}{2000} = \\frac{1500}{2000} = 0.75$$\nAlternatively, since $p+q=1$, we have $q = 1 - p = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$. Since $p  q$, allele $a$ is indeed the minor allele.\n\nNow, we use these allele frequencies to calculate the HWE-expected genotype frequencies using the formulas from Part 2.\n\n- Expected frequency of $AA$:\n  $$P(AA) = q^2 = (0.75)^2 = 0.5625$$\n\n- Expected frequency of $Aa$:\n  $$P(Aa) = 2pq = 2 \\times 0.25 \\times 0.75 = 0.5 \\times 0.75 = 0.375$$\n\n- Expected frequency of $aa$:\n  $$P(aa) = p^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625$$\n\nThe problem requires these probabilities to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n- $P(AA) = 0.5625$. This number already has exactly $4$ significant figures.\n- $P(Aa) = 0.375$. To express this with $4$ significant figures, we add a trailing zero: $0.3750$.\n- $P(aa) = 0.0625$. The leading zero is not significant. The digits $6$, $2$, $5$ are significant. To show $4$ significant figures, we add a trailing zero: $0.06250$.\n\nThe final results for the expected frequencies are $0.5625$, $0.3750$, and $0.06250$ for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively. These are presented as a row matrix as requested.",

Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is the non-random association of alleles at different loci. The squared correlation $r^2$ is a common measure of LD.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for $r^2$. Let us define two indicator random variables, $X_A$ and $X_B$, for a randomly selected chromosome from the population sample.\n$X_A = 1$ if the allele at variant $1$ is $A$, and $X_A=0$ if the allele is $a$.\n$X_B = 1$ if the allele at variant $2$ is $B$, and $X_B=0$ if the allele is $b$.\n\nThe probabilities of these events are given by the marginal allele frequencies. Let $p_A$ be the frequency of allele $A$, $p_a$ be the frequency of allele $a$, $p_B$ be the frequency of allele $B$, and $p_b$ be the frequency of allele $b$. By definition, $p_a = 1 - p_A$ and $p_b = 1 - p_B$.\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates.\n$$E[X_A] = 1 \\cdot P(X_A=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_A=0) = P(X_A=1) = p_A$$\n$$E[X_B] = P(X_B=1) = p_B$$\nThe variance of an indicator variable $X$ is $\\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$.

The expectation of this product is therefore the frequency of the $AB$ haplotype, denoted as $p_{AB}$.\n$$E[X_A X_B] = P(X_A=1 \\text{ and } X_B=1) = p_{AB}$$\nSubstituting this into the covariance formula:\n$$\\text{Cov}(X_A, X_B) = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nThis covariance term is the standard definition of the linkage disequilibrium coefficient, $D$.\n$$D = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nNow we can write the correlation coefficient $r$ in terms of $D$ and the allele frequencies:\n$$r = \\frac{D}{\\sqrt{p_A p_a p_B p_b}}$$\nThe problem asks for the squared correlation, $r^2$:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A p_a p_B p_b} = \\frac{(p_{AB} - p_A p_B)^2}{p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)}$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we calculate the value of $r^2$ using the given data.

The analysis uses a two-step procedure: first, the quantitative trait is residualized with respect to a set of covariates, and second, these residuals are regressed on the SNP genotype.\n\nThe full linear model for a GWAS is specified as:\n$$y_i = \\mathbf{x}_i^T \\boldsymbol{\\gamma} + \\beta g_i + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere $y_i$ is the trait value for individual $i$, $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is a vector of covariates including an intercept, $\\boldsymbol{\\gamma}$ is the vector of covariate effects, $g_i$ is the SNP genotype, $\\beta$ is the SNP effect size, and $\\epsilon_i$ is an error term.\n\nThe Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem states that the OLS estimate of $\\beta$ in the full model above is numerically identical to the slope coefficient obtained from a simple regression of the residuals of $y$ on the residuals of $g$, where both are residualized with respect to the covariates $\\mathbf{x}$.
