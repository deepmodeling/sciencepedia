            "problem": "In a population study of a specific species of wildflower, a geneticist examines two gene loci on the same chromosome. The first locus, which we can call locus 'A', determines petal color, with allele 'A' conferring red petals and allele 'a' conferring white petals.

After sampling a large number of plants from the population, the geneticist determines the counts of the four possible haplotypes.

            "introduction": "While the $D$ coefficient is the cornerstone of LD, its value is dependent on the allele frequencies at the loci, which can make comparisons challenging. This practice introduces the squared correlation coefficient, $r^2$, a normalized measure of LD that is widely used in population genetics and disease-mapping studies. Calculating $r^2$ allows you to assess the statistical strength of the association between two loci, independent of their allele frequencies .",
