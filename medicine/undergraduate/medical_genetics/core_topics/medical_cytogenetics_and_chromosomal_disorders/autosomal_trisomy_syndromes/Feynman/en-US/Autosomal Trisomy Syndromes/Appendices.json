            "problem": "In medical genetics, the maternal-age effect on the incidence of autosomal trisomy syndromes (for example, trisomy $21$, trisomy $18$, trisomy $13$) is widely observed and is commonly modeled by assuming that the risk increases proportionally per year of maternal age due to increasing meiotic nondisjunction rates. Let $r(a)$ denote the absolute risk at maternal age $a$ and define the Relative Risk (RR) as $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0}) = r(a)/r(a_{0})$, where $a_{0}$ is a specified reference age. Assume a log-linear age effect, meaning that the instantaneous proportional change in risk per year is constant and equal to $\\beta = 0.12$ per year. \n\nStarting from the definition of $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0})$ and the log-linear assumption (constant proportional increase per unit age), derive an expression for $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0})$ as a function of $\\beta$ and $\\Delta a = a - a_{0}$. Then, using your derived expression, compute the relative risk of autosomal trisomy for a $40$-year-old versus a $25$-year-old.\n\nRound your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it as a dimensionless ratio (no units).",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The absolute risk at maternal age $a$ is denoted by $r(a)$.\n- The Relative Risk (RR) is defined as $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0}) = \\frac{r(a)}{r(a_{0})}$, where $a_{0}$ is a reference age.\n- The model assumes a log-linear age effect, which is defined as a constant instantaneous proportional change in risk per year.\n- This constant is given as $\\beta = 0.12$ per year.\n- The age difference is defined as $\\Delta a = a - a_{0}$.\n- The specific ages for computation are $a = 40$ years and $a_{0} = 25$ years.\n- The final numerical answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes the maternal-age effect on autosomal trisomy risk, a well-established phenomenon in medical genetics. The use of a log-linear or exponential model to describe this relationship is a standard and widely accepted epidemiological approach. The value of $\\beta = 0.12$ is consistent with published estimates for trisomy risk models. The problem is therefore scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear definition of the risk function's behavior (constant proportional increase), a definition for relative risk, and all necessary constants and values to derive an expression and compute a specific numerical result. The task is unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, formal language common to quantitative sciences. It is free of subjectivity or opinion.\n- All other criteria for validity are met. The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem states that the instantaneous proportional change in risk per year is a constant, $\\beta$. This can be expressed as a differential equation. The risk is $r(a)$, the change in risk with respect to age is $\\frac{dr(a)}{da}$, and the proportional change is $\\frac{1}{r(a)}\\frac{dr(a)}{da}$. Setting this equal to the constant $\\beta$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r(a)} \\frac{dr(a)}{da} = \\beta\n$$\nThis is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange it to separate the variables $r$ and $a$:\n$$\n\\frac{dr}{r} = \\beta \\, da\n$$\nTo find the function $r(a)$, we integrate both sides of the equation. We can perform a definite integration from a reference age $a_{0}$ with risk $r(a_{0})$ to a general age $a$ with risk $r(a)$:\n$$\n\\int_{r(a_{0})}^{r(a)} \\frac{1}{r'} dr' = \\int_{a_{0}}^{a} \\beta \\, da'\n$$\nThe integral on the left side is $\\ln(r')$, and the integral on the right side is $\\beta a'$:\n$$\n\\left[ \\ln(r') \\right]_{r(a_{0})}^{r(a)} = \\left[ \\beta a' \\right]_{a_{0}}^{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(r(a)) - \\ln(r(a_0)) = \\beta a - \\beta a_0\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$, we can combine the terms on the left:\n$$\n\\ln\\left( \\frac{r(a)}{r(a_{0})} \\right) = \\beta (a - a_{0})\n$$\nThe problem defines the Relative Risk (RR) as $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0}) = \\frac{r(a)}{r(a_{0})}$ and the age difference as $\\Delta a = a - a_{0}$. Substituting these definitions into our equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln(RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0})) = \\beta \\Delta a\n$$\nTo find the expression for $RR(a \\,|\\, a_{0})$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\nRR(a \\,|\\, a_{0}) = \\exp(\\beta \\Delta a)\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the relative risk as a function of $\\beta$ and $\\Delta a$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nNext, we compute the relative risk for a $40$-year-old versus a $25$-year-old.\nThe given values are:\n- Maternal age $a = 40$ years.\n- Reference maternal age $a_{0} = 25$ years.\n- Proportional increase constant $\\beta = 0.12$ per year.\n\nFirst, we calculate the age difference, $\\Delta a$:\n$$\n\\Delta a = a - a_{0} = 40 - 25 = 15 \\text{ years}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values of $\\beta$ and $\\Delta a$ into the derived expression for relative risk:\n$$\nRR(40 \\,|\\, 25) = \\exp(\\beta \\Delta a) = \\exp(0.12 \\times 15)\n$$\nThe value of the exponent is:\n$$\n0.12 \\times 15 = 1.8\n$$\nThus, the relative risk is:\n$$\nRR(40 \\,|\\, 25) = \\exp(1.8)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(1.8) \\approx 6.04964746\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $0$, $4$, and $9$. The fifth significant digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit. The digit $9$ rounds up to $10$, which means we change the $9$ to a $0$ and carry over to the preceding digit, changing $4$ to $5$.\nTherefore, the rounded value is $6.050$.",

            "problem": "In autosomal trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), somatic cells carry three copies of chromosome 21. Consider a representative protein-coding gene located on chromosome 21 with a per-copy basal transcription rate $r$ (in arbitrary mRNA units per unit time) and a first-order mRNA degradation rate constant $d$ (per unit time). Assume that steady-state transcript abundance arises from the balance between transcription and degradation, that transcripts from each gene copy are produced independently, and that $r$ and $d$ are unchanged across karyotypes under the linear dosage assumption. Starting from these core definitions and facts, derive the steady-state expression level $E(n)$ for $n$ gene copies and then compute the fold-change $F$ between trisomy ($n=3$) and disomy ($n=2$). Report $F$ as an exact fraction.\n\nIn addition, using mechanistic reasoning grounded in the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and well-tested observations about transcriptional regulation and mRNA turnover, explain why empirical measurements may deviate from the exact linear expectation. To formalize one source of deviation, suppose that global resource limitation or feedback introduces an attenuation of the per-copy transcription rate such that the effective rate depends on total dosage according to $r_{\\text{eff}}(n)=\\frac{r}{1+\\beta n}$, where $\\beta>0$ is a constant that is unchanged across karyotypes. Under this attenuation model, derive the analytic expression for the trisomy-to-disomy fold-change $F_{\\beta}$ in terms of $\\beta$ and $d$. Do not round any expressions. The final reported numerical answer should be the linear-dosage fold-change $F$ only; express it as an exact fraction with no units.",
            "solution": "The foundational starting point is the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology and the steady-state kinetics of mRNA, which state that mRNA abundance for a gene at steady state is determined by the balance between production and degradation. For a gene with $n$ copies, if each copy contributes independently and identically to transcription, and mRNA degradation is first order with rate constant $d$, then the net mRNA dynamics can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = n r - d m,\n$$\nwhere $m$ denotes the total mRNA abundance attributable to the gene. At steady state, $\\frac{dm}{dt}=0$, so\n$$\n0 = n r - d m \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad m = \\frac{n r}{d}.\n$$\nThus, the steady-state expression level as a function of copy number is\n$$\nE(n) = \\frac{n r}{d}.\n$$\nUnder the linear dosage assumption, the parameters $r$ and $d$ do not change across karyotypes, so the fold-change comparing trisomy ($n=3$) to disomy ($n=2$) is\n$$\nF = \\frac{E(3)}{E(2)} = \\frac{\\frac{3 r}{d}}{\\frac{2 r}{d}} = \\frac{3}{2}.\n$$\nThis exact fraction arises directly from the ratio of gene copies when per-copy transcription and degradation are held constant.\n\nNext, we explain why empirical measurements may deviate from this exact linear expectation. Several mechanistic factors can produce nonlinearity:\n\n- Transcriptional feedback and resource limitation: The cellular pool of general transcription factors, RNA polymerase II, nucleotides, and chromatin remodeling complexes is finite. Increasing the number of templates (copies) can reduce per-copy transcriptional efficiency via competition, leading to attenuation of $r$ as $n$ increases.\n- Post-transcriptional regulation: MicroRNAs and RNA-binding proteins, including those encoded on chromosome $21$, can alter mRNA stability and translation. If the abundance of destabilizing factors increases with $n$, the effective degradation rate $d$ may increase in trisomy, reducing the observed fold-change.\n- Chromatin and nuclear organization: Changes in three-dimensional genome organization and epigenetic marks with aneuploidy can alter promoter accessibility and transcriptional burst kinetics, decoupling expression from copy number.\n- Proteostasis and stoichiometry: Imbalances in protein complexes due to dosage changes can trigger stress responses that globally modulate transcription and mRNA decay, further buffering expression.\n\nTo formalize one such attenuation effect, consider the minimal model in which the per-copy transcription rate is reduced with total dosage:\n$$\nr_{\\text{eff}}(n) = \\frac{r}{1+\\beta n}, \\quad \\beta>0.\n$$\nThe steady-state expression with this attenuation is\n$$\nE_{\\beta}(n) = \\frac{n \\, r_{\\text{eff}}(n)}{d} = \\frac{n}{d} \\cdot \\frac{r}{1+\\beta n} = \\frac{n r}{d(1+\\beta n)}.\n$$\nTherefore, the trisomy-to-disomy fold-change under attenuation is\n$$\nF_{\\beta} = \\frac{E_{\\beta}(3)}{E_{\\beta}(2)} = \\frac{\\frac{3 r}{d(1+3\\beta)}}{\\frac{2 r}{d(1+2\\beta)}} = \\frac{3(1+2\\beta)}{2(1+3\\beta)}.\n$$\nThis expression shows how attenuation lowers the fold-change relative to the linear value. Specifically, when $\\beta=0$, attenuation vanishes and $F_{\\beta}=\\frac{3}{2}$; when $\\beta>0$, we have $F_{\\beta}<\\frac{3}{2}$ because the denominator $2(1+3\\beta)$ grows faster than the numerator $3(1+2\\beta)$ as $\\beta$ increases. Analogously, if changes in mRNA stability are modeled as an $n$-dependent degradation rate $d(n)$ that increases with $n$, then $F$ would also be reduced relative to the linear expectation.\n\nIn summary, the linear-dosage fold-change derived from first principles under constant $r$ and $d$ is $\\frac{3}{2}$, while biologically realistic attenuation mechanisms yield analytic deviations such as $F_{\\beta}=\\frac{3(1+2\\beta)}{2(1+3\\beta)}$.",

Their previous child had Down syndrome due to standard free trisomy $21$ arising from meiotic nondisjunction, and parental karyotypes were normal (no balanced translocation).
