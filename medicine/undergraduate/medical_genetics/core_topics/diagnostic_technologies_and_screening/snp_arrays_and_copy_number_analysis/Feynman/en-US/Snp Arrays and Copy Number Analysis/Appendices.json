            "problem": "In single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays used for copy number analysis, the total probe intensity at a locus reflects the amount of hybridized genomic DNA. To compare a sample to a diploid expectation, intensities are normalized to a reference. The Log R Ratio (LRR) is defined as the base-$2$ logarithm of the ratio of the sample’s total probe intensity to the reference intensity. Consider a locus where the measured total intensity is $R=800$ and the matched reference intensity is $R_{\\text{ref}}=1000$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Log R Ratio (LRR) for a given locus and an assessment of whether this value indicates a copy number gain or loss.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  The definition of Log R Ratio: $LRR = \\log_2(\\frac{R_{\\text{sample}}}{R_{\\text{reference}}})$.\n2.  The sample's total probe intensity: $R = 800$. In this context, $R$ is equivalent to $R_{\\text{sample}}$.\n3.  The reference intensity: $R_{\\text{ref}} = 1000$.\n4.  A requirement to round the final numerical answer to $4$ significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as the definition of LRR is a standard concept in the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data for detecting copy number variations. It is well-posed, with all necessary information provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe first step is to compute the LRR using its definition. The total probe intensity of the sample is given as $R = 800$, and the reference intensity is $R_{\\text{ref}} = 1000$. The LRR is calculated as follows:\n$$LRR = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{R}{R_{\\text{ref}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$LRR = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{800}{1000}\\right)$$\n$$LRR = \\log_{2}(0.8)$$\nTo compute the base-$2$ logarithm, we can use the change of base formula, which states that $\\log_{b}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(b)}$ for any base $b > 0, b \\neq 1$. Using the natural logarithm (base $e$):\n$$LRR = \\frac{\\ln(0.8)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical values of the logarithms.\nThe natural logarithm of $0.8$ is approximately:\n$$\\ln(0.8) \\approx -0.22314355$$\nThe natural logarithm of $2$ is approximately:\n$$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$$\nDividing these values gives the LRR:\n$$LRR \\approx \\frac{-0.22314355}{0.69314718} \\approx -0.32192809$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first significant figure is the $3$ in the tenths place. Counting four figures leads to keeping $-0.3219$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we do not round up.\n$$LRR \\approx -0.3219$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine if this LRR value indicates a copy number gain or loss. A normal diploid region has a copy number of 2, resulting in an LRR of $\\log_2(2/2) = 0$. An LRR value less than 0 indicates a copy number less than 2, which is a loss. An LRR value greater than 0 indicates a copy number greater than 2, which is a gain. Since the computed LRR is -0.3219, which is negative, it indicates a copy number loss at this locus.\n\nThe final answer requested is the computed LRR as a unitless decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures.",

To truly understand BAF plots, it is essential to grasp the theoretical relationship between allele counts and the resulting BAF signal.

            "problem": "A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array measures allele-specific hybridization intensities at a locus using two probe sets, one targeting allele $A$ and the other targeting allele $B$. The B Allele Frequency (BAF) is defined as the relative contribution of the $B$-allele signal to the total allelic signal after normalization, and for expected values can be modeled by the ratio of expected $B$-specific intensity to the sum of expected $A$- and $B$-specific intensities.\n\nAssume the following foundational model:\n- At a locus with total copy number $C$, the genotype consists of $n_A$ copies of allele $A$ and $n_B$ copies of allele $B$, with $n_A + n_B = C$.\n- Each copy contributes additively to the probe intensity, with per-copy sensitivity constants $s_A$ for the $A$-probe and $s_B$ for the $B$-probe.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to first derive a general formula for the expected B Allele Frequency ($BAF$) and then apply it to specific cases under a simplifying assumption.\n\nThe definition of the expected $BAF$ is given as:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{I_B}{I_A + I_B}\n$$\nThe expected intensities for the $A$ and $B$ alleles are modeled as linear functions of their respective copy numbers, $n_A$ and $n_B$, and sensitivity constants, $s_A$ and $s_B$:\n$$\nI_A = s_A n_A\n$$\n$$\nI_B = s_B n_B\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $I_A$ and $I_B$ into the definition of $BAF$ yields the general formula for the expected $BAF$ as a function of the model parameters:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{s_B n_B}{s_A n_A + s_B n_B}\n$$\nThis is the general formula derived from the initial premises.\n\nNext, we impose the condition of equal probe sensitivity, which is a common assumption for an idealized, well-calibrated SNP array. This condition is stated as $s_A = s_B$. Let us denote this common sensitivity constant by $s$, where $s > 0$ for a signal to be detectable. Substituting $s_A = s$ and $s_B = s$ into the general $BAF$ formula:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{s \\cdot n_B}{s \\cdot n_A + s \\cdot n_B}\n$$\nThe sensitivity constant $s$ can be factored out from the denominator:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{s \\cdot n_B}{s (n_A + n_B)}\n$$\nSince $s \\neq 0$, it can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{n_B}{n_A + n_B}\n$$\nThe problem also states that the sum of the allele copy numbers equals the total copy number, $C = n_A + n_B$. Therefore, the simplified formula for expected $BAF$ under the condition of equal probe sensitivity is:\n$$\nBAF = \\frac{n_B}{C}\n$$\nThis formula shows that for an idealized array, the expected $BAF$ is simply the proportion of $B$ alleles out of the total number of alleles at the locus.\n\nThe final step is to compute the expected $BAF$ cluster positions for a total copy number of $C = 3$ for the two specified allele configurations.\n\n1.  **Genotype AAB**:\n    For this configuration, the number of $A$ alleles is $n_A = 2$ and the number of $B$ alleles is $n_B = 1$. The total copy number is $C = n_A + n_B = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n    Using the simplified formula, the expected $BAF$ is:\n    $$\n    BAF_{AAB} = \\frac{n_B}{C} = \\frac{1}{3}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Genotype ABB**:\n    For this configuration, the number of $A$ alleles is $n_A = 1$ and the number of $B$ alleles is $n_B = 2$. The total copy number is $C = n_A + n_B = 1 + 2 = 3$.\n    Using the simplified formula, the expected $BAF$ is:\n    $$\n    BAF_{ABB} = \\frac{n_B}{C} = \\frac{2}{3}\n    $$\n\nThe problem requires reporting these two values, $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ and $\\dfrac{2}{3}$, in the specified order ($AAB$ then $ABB$) as a row vector.",

            "problem": "A tumor sample is profiled on a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of SNP array-based copy number analysis, is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first establishing a general formula for the log R ratio (LRR) as a function of the average copy number, and then as a function of tumor purity for the specific case of a hemizygous deletion.\n\n**Step 1: General Formula for LRR in terms of Copy Number**\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the total probe intensity, $R$, is linearly proportional to the total DNA copy number, which we will denote as $C$. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$R = kC$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe reference intensity, $R_{0}$, corresponds to a purely diploid reference sample, for which the copy number is $C=2$. Therefore:\n$$R_{0} = k \\cdot 2$$\n\nThe LRR is defined as LRR $= \\log_{2}(R/R_{0})$. For a sample with an average copy number $C_{\\text{avg}}$, the corresponding intensity is $R = k \\cdot C_{\\text{avg}}$. Substituting the expressions for $R$ and $R_{0}$ into the LRR definition, we get:\n$$\\text{LRR} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{k \\cdot C_{\\text{avg}}}{k \\cdot 2}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{avg}}}{2}\\right)$$\nThis equation relates the observed LRR directly to the underlying average copy number of the sample being measured. An LRR of $0$ corresponds to $C_{\\text{avg}}=2$.\n\n**Step 2: Average Copy Number as a Function of Purity**\n\nThe problem specifies a mixed sample containing a fraction $p$ of tumor cells and a fraction $1-p$ of normal cells. The expected average copy number, $C_{\\text{avg}}$, is given by the mixture model:\n$$C_{\\text{avg}} = p \\cdot C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p) \\cdot C_{\\text{normal}}$$\nWe are given that the normal cells are diploid, so $C_{\\text{normal}}=2$. The genomic segment in the tumor cells has a hemizygous deletion, meaning one of the two parental copies is lost, so $C_{\\text{tumor}}=1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the mixture model gives the average copy number as a function of purity $p$:\n$$C_{\\text{avg}}(p) = p(1) + (1-p)(2) = p + 2 - 2p = 2 - p$$\n\n**Step 3: LRR as a Function of Purity for a Hemizygous Deletion**\n\nBy combining the results from Step 1 and Step 2, we can express the expected LRR for a hemizygous deletion as a function of tumor purity $p$:\n$$\\text{LRR}(p) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{C_{\\text{avg}}(p)}{2}\\right) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2-p}{2}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Numerical Calculation for $p=0.6$**\n\nFor a tumor purity of $p=0.6$, the average copy number is:\n$$C_{\\text{avg}}(0.6) = 2 - 0.6 = 1.4$$\nThe corresponding expected LRR is:\n$$\\text{LRR}(0.6) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1.4}{2}\\right) = \\log_{2}(0.7)$$\nTo evaluate this numerically:\n$$\\text{LRR}(0.6) = \\frac{\\ln(0.7)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{-0.3566749}{0.6931472} \\approx -0.514573$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $-0.5146$.\n\n**Step 5: Numerical Calculation for $p=0.2$**\n\nFor a tumor purity of $p=0.2$, the average copy number is:\n$$C_{\\text{avg}}(0.2) = 2 - 0.2 = 1.8$$\nThe corresponding expected LRR is:\n$$\\text{LRR}(0.2) = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{1.8}{2}\\right) = \\log_{2}(0.9)$$\nTo evaluate this numerically:\n$$\\text{LRR}(0.2) = \\frac{\\ln(0.9)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{-0.1053605}{0.6931472} \\approx -0.152003$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $-0.1520$. The trailing zero is significant.\n\n**Qualitative Interpretation**\n\nThe LRR measures the deviation from the diploid state (copy number $2$), which has an LRR of $\\log_{2}(2/2) = \\log_{2}(1)=0$. The deviation from this baseline is caused by the presence of tumor cells, which have an aberrant copy number of $1$. The formula for the average copy number, $C_{\\text{avg}} = 2 - p$, shows that the sample's copy number is a weighted average of the normal component (at copy number $2$) and the tumor component (at copy number $1$). As tumor purity $p$ decreases, the weight of the abnormal tumor component diminishes, and the overall average copy number $C_{\\text{avg}}$ becomes closer to the normal value of $2$. Consequently, the ratio $C_{\\text{avg}}/2$ moves closer to $1$, and its base-$2$ logarithm, the LRR, moves closer to $0$. This phenomenon is described as attenuation: the signal of the biological event (the deletion) is diluted by the larger fraction of normal cells, resulting in a weaker, less-pronounced LRR value.",
