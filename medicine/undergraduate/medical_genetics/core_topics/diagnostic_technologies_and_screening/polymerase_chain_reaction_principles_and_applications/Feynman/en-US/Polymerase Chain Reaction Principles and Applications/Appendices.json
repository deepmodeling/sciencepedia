In qPCR, fluorescent signal arises from reporter molecules bound to newly formed double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and the signal is monitored each cycle. The laboratory applies signal baselining and thresholding to determine the threshold cycle, which is defined as the cycle at which the baseline-corrected fluorescence first exceeds a fixed threshold.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded model of the qPCR signal per cycle $c$:\n- The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifies the number of target molecules according to $N(c) = N_{0}(1+E)^{c}$, where $N_{0}$ is the initial target copy number and $E$ is the per-cycle amplification efficiency ($0 \\leq E \\leq 1$).\n- The measured fluorescence is $F(c) = B(c) + \\alpha N(c) + \\varepsilon_{c}$, where $B(c) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} c$ is a baseline drift term due to gradual dye photobleaching, $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant relating amplicon quantity to fluorescence, and $\\varepsilon_{c}$ is zero-mean instrument noise with variance $\\sigma^{2}$.\n- The baseline-corrected signal is defined as $S(c) = F(c) - B(c)$.\n- The laboratory’s thresholding rule sets a fixed threshold on the baseline-corrected signal given by $\\theta = \\tau \\sigma$, where $\\tau$ is a positive constant chosen by quality assurance to exceed baseline noise fluctuations.\n\nStarting from the core facts above and without assuming any shortcut formulas, determine the threshold cycle $c_{t}$ at which the expected baseline-corrected signal equals the threshold, that is, at $\\mathbb{E}[S(c_{t})] = \\theta$, using the following experimentally determined parameters:\n- $N_{0} = 25$ copies,\n- $E = 0.90$,\n- $\\alpha = 3.5 \\times 10^{-9}$ relative fluorescence units (RFU) per copy,\n- $\\beta_{0} = 0.15$ RFU,\n- $\\beta_{1} = -1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ RFU per cycle,\n- $\\sigma = 6.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ RFU,\n- $\\tau = 12$.\n\nCompute $c_{t}$ as a pure number of cycles.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the threshold cycle, $c_t$, in a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) experiment. The threshold cycle is defined as the cycle at which the expected value of the baseline-corrected signal, $\\mathbb{E}[S(c_t)]$, equals a fixed threshold, $\\theta$.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical expressions for the quantities involved, based on the provided model. The measured fluorescence signal at cycle $c$ is given by:\n$$\nF(c) = B(c) + \\alpha N(c) + \\varepsilon_{c}\n$$\nwhere $B(c)$ is the baseline drift, $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant, $N(c)$ is the number of target molecules, and $\\varepsilon_{c}$ is instrument noise.\n\nThe baseline drift is modeled as a linear function of the cycle number:\n$$\nB(c) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1} c\n$$\n\nThe number of target DNA molecules is amplified exponentially with cycle number:\n$$\nN(c) = N_{0}(1+E)^{c}\n$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of copies and $E$ is the amplification efficiency.\n\nThe baseline-corrected signal, $S(c)$, is defined as:\n$$\nS(c) = F(c) - B(c)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $F(c)$, we get:\n$$\nS(c) = (B(c) + \\alpha N(c) + \\varepsilon_{c}) - B(c) = \\alpha N(c) + \\varepsilon_{c}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the threshold cycle $c_t$ is found when the *expected* baseline-corrected signal equals the threshold $\\theta$. We must therefore compute the expected value of $S(c)$, denoted $\\mathbb{E}[S(c)]$. Using the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S(c)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha N(c) + \\varepsilon_{c}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha N(c)] + \\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{c}]\n$$\nIn this model, the amplification process $N(c) = N_0(1+E)^c$ is deterministic, with $N_0$ and $E$ being fixed parameters. The constant $\\alpha$ is also a fixed parameter. Therefore, the term $\\alpha N(c)$ is not a random variable, and its expected value is itself:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\alpha N(c)] = \\alpha N(c) = \\alpha N_{0}(1+E)^{c}\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\varepsilon_{c}$ is zero-mean instrument noise, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_{c}] = 0$.\nThus, the expected baseline-corrected signal is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S(c)] = \\alpha N_{0}(1+E)^{c}\n$$\nIt is noteworthy that the baseline parameters, $\\beta_{0}$ and $\\beta_{1}$, do not appear in the final expression for the expected baseline-corrected signal. This is a direct consequence of the definition of baseline correction, which is designed to mathematically remove the baseline drift.\n\nThe fluorescence threshold, $\\theta$, is given by the rule:\n$$\n\\theta = \\tau \\sigma\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is a constant multiplier and $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the instrument noise.\n\nThe threshold cycle $c_t$ is the cycle number that satisfies the condition $\\mathbb{E}[S(c_{t})] = \\theta$.

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory is quantifying the relative messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) abundance of a disease-associated gene in a patient compared to a matched healthy control using reverse transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), where quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) measures the cycle at which the fluorescence of amplified complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) exceeds a fixed detection threshold. Assume fluorescence is directly proportional to the quantity of amplicon cDNA and the detection threshold is identical across all runs.\n\nConsider the following fundamental facts:\n- In Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), if the per-cycle amplification factor is $F$ (with $F = 1 + \\eta$ and $0 \\leq \\eta \\leq 1$ denoting the efficiency), then after $n$ cycles the amplicon quantity is $Q_{n} = Q_{0} \\, F^{n}$, where $Q_{0}$ is the initial template quantity.\n- In qPCR, the cycle threshold $C_{t}$ is the smallest cycle number at which the amplicon quantity surpasses the fixed threshold $Q_{T}$.\n\nA standard curve generated from $10$-fold serial dilutions yields a linear relationship between $C_{t}$ and $\\log_{10}(Q_{0})$ with slope $m$ (negative in practice). From the exponential growth law above and the definition of $C_{t}$, derive the relationship between $m$ and the per-cycle amplification factor $F$, and use it to correct the relative quantification for amplification efficiency.\n\nYou are given the following empirically measured slopes for the standard curves:\n- Target gene slope: $m_{t} = -3.50$.\n- Reference gene slope: $m_{r} = -3.40$.\n\nYou are given mean cycle threshold measurements for the patient ($P$) and healthy control ($C$):\n- Target gene $C_{t}$ values: $C_{t,t}^{(P)} = 23.10$ and $C_{t,t}^{(C)} = 24.00$.\n- Reference gene $C_{t}$ values: $C_{t,r}^{(P)} = 19.50$ and $C_{t,r}^{(C)} = 19.20$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental exponential amplification model and the definition of $C_{t}$ and the standard curve slope, derive from first principles an expression for the patient-to-control fold change in target gene initial abundance normalized to the reference gene, and compute its numerical value. Express the fold change as a unitless decimal and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relative quantification formula for RT-qPCR from first principles and its application to a given dataset. The derivation and calculation will proceed in three stages: first, establishing the relationship between the standard curve slope $m$ and the amplification factor $F$; second, deriving the formula for normalized relative gene expression; and third, computing the numerical result.\n\n**1. Relationship between Standard Curve Slope ($m$) and Amplification Factor ($F$)**\n\nThe exponential growth of the amplicon (cDNA) in PCR is described by the equation:\n$$\nQ_n = Q_0 F^n\n$$\nwhere $Q_n$ is the quantity of amplicon after $n$ cycles, $Q_0$ is the initial quantity of template, and $F$ is the per-cycle amplification factor. The factor $F$ is related to the amplification efficiency $\\eta$ by $F = 1 + \\eta$, where an ideal reaction has $\\eta=1$ and thus $F=2$.\n\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence, proportional to $Q_n$, crosses a fixed threshold. Let the amplicon quantity at this threshold be $Q_T$. At $n=C_t$, we have:\n$$\nQ_T = Q_0 F^{C_t}\n$$\nThe problem states that a standard curve is generated by plotting $C_t$ against $\\log_{10}(Q_0)$, yielding a linear relationship with slope $m$. To derive this relationship, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of the equation above:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(Q_T) = \\log_{10}(Q_0 F^{C_t})\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this expands to:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(Q_T) = \\log_{10}(Q_0) + \\log_{10}(F^{C_t})\n$$\n$$\n\\log_{10}(Q_T) = \\log_{10}(Q_0) + C_t \\log_{10}(F)\n$$\nTo express $C_t$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(Q_0)$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\nC_t \\log_{10}(F) = \\log_{10}(Q_T) - \\log_{10}(Q_0)\n$$\n$$\nC_t = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(F)}\\right) \\log_{10}(Q_0) + \\frac{\\log_{10}(Q_T)}{\\log_{10}(F)}\n$$\nThis is an equation of a straight line, $y=mx+b$, where $y = C_t$, $x = \\log_{10}(Q_0)$, the intercept is $b = \\frac{\\log_{10}(Q_T)}{\\log_{10}(F)}$, and the slope $m$ is:\n$$\nm = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(F)}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the amplification factor $F$ in terms of the experimentally determined slope $m$:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(F) = -\\frac{1}{m} \\implies F = 10^{-1/m}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Relative Quantification Formula**\n\nThe goal is to find the patient-to-control fold change in the initial abundance of the target gene's mRNA, normalized to a reference gene. Let $t$ denote the target gene and $r$ the reference gene. Let the superscript $(P)$ denote the patient sample and $(C)$ denote the healthy control sample. The desired relative quantification ratio, $R$, is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\text{Normalized abundance in Patient}}{\\text{Normalized abundance in Control}} = \\frac{ \\left( Q_{0,t}^{(P)} / Q_{0,r}^{(P)} \\right) }{ \\left( Q_{0,t}^{(C)} / Q_{0,r}^{(C)} \\right) }\n$$\nFrom the threshold equation $Q_T = Q_0 F^{C_t}$, we can express the initial quantity as $Q_0 = Q_T F^{-C_t}$. The problem specifies that the detection threshold $Q_T$ is identical across all runs. Let $F_t$ and $F_r$ be the amplification factors for the target and reference genes, respectively, which are determined by their corresponding standard curve slopes ($m_t, m_r$).\n\nWe can write the initial quantities for each gene in each sample:\n- Patient, target gene: $Q_{0,t}^{(P)} = Q_T (F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}}$\n- Control, target gene: $Q_{0,t}^{(C)} = Q_T (F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}}$\n- Patient, reference gene: $Q_{0,r}^{(P)} = Q_T (F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(P)}}$\n- Control, reference gene: $Q_{0,r}^{(C)} = Q_T (F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(C)}}$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{ \\left( Q_T(F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}} / Q_T(F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(P)}} \\right) }{ \\left( Q_T(F_t)^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}} / Q_T(F_r)^{-C_{t,r}^{(C)}} \\right) }\n$$\nThe $Q_T$ terms cancel out:\n$$\nR = \\frac{ F_t^{-C_{t,t}^{(P)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(P)}} }{ F_t^{-C_{t,t}^{(C)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(C)}} } = F_t^{C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)}} \\cdot F_r^{C_{t,r}^{(P)} - C_{t,r}^{(C)}}\n$$\nThis expression, known as the Pfaffl equation, provides the efficiency-corrected relative quantification. To make it more compact, let's define the difference in $C_t$ values between the control and patient samples for each gene:\n- Target gene: $\\Delta C_{t,t} = C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)}$\n- Reference gene: $\\Delta C_{t,r} = C_{t,r}^{(C)} - C_{t,r}^{(P)}$\n\nSubstituting these into the formula gives:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(F_t)^{\\Delta C_{t,t}}}{(F_r)^{-\\Delta C_{t,r}}}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Slopes: $m_t = -3.50$ and $m_r = -3.40$.\n- Target gene $C_t$ values: $C_{t,t}^{(P)} = 23.10$ and $C_{t,t}^{(C)} = 24.00$.\n- Reference gene $C_t$ values: $C_{t,r}^{(P)} = 19.50$ and $C_{t,r}^{(C)} = 19.20$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the amplification factors $F_t$ and $F_r$ using the derived relation $F = 10^{-1/m}$:\n$$\nF_t = 10^{-1/(-3.50)} = 10^{1/3.50}\n$$\n$$\nF_r = 10^{-1/(-3.40)} = 10^{1/3.40}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the $\\Delta C_t$ values:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{t,t} = C_{t,t}^{(C)} - C_{t,t}^{(P)} = 24.00 - 23.10 = 0.90\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta C_{t,r} = C_{t,r}^{(C)} - C_{t,r}^{(P)} = 19.20 - 19.50 = -0.30\n$$\nNow, substitute all values into the final expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{(10^{1/3.50})^{0.90}}{(10^{1/3.40})^{-0.30}} = \\frac{10^{0.90/3.50}}{10^{-0.30/3.40}}\n$$\nUsing the property $a^x / a^y = a^{x-y}$:\n$$\nR = 10^{\\left(\\frac{0.90}{3.50} - \\left(-\\frac{0.30}{3.40}\\right)\\right)} = 10^{\\left(\\frac{0.90}{3.50} + \\frac{0.30}{3.40}\\right)}\n$$\nWe compute the exponent:\n$$\n\\frac{0.90}{3.50} + \\frac{0.30}{3.40} = \\frac{9}{35} + \\frac{3}{34} = \\frac{9 \\times 34 + 3 \\times 35}{35 \\times 34} = \\frac{306 + 105}{1190} = \\frac{411}{1190}\n$$\nSo, the fold change is:\n$$\nR = 10^{411/1190} \\approx 10^{0.34537815...} \\approx 2.215093...\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures yields $2.215$.",
