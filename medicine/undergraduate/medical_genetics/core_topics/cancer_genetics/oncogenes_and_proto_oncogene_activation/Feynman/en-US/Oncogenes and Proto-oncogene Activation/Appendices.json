This first exercise builds this foundation from first principles. By starting with a known tumor composition—including purity and the fraction of cancer cells with a specific subclonal mutation—you will calculate the expected variant allele fraction (VAF) that a sequencing assay would report, providing a clear link between tumor heterogeneity and genomic measurements .",

            "problem": "A bulk sequencing assay is performed on a solid tumor biopsy to characterize an activating mutation in the proto-oncogene KRAS. In the specimen, the fraction of cancer cells (tumor purity) is $0.50$, with the remaining cells being normal stromal cells. Within the cancer cell population, a subclone comprising $0.20$ of cancer cells harbors a single-nucleotide variant (SNV). Assume the following fundamental facts: (i) KRAS is located on an autosome and is diploid in both normal and cancer cells in this sample, (ii) the mutation is heterozygous in each mutated cancer cell, (iii) there is no copy-number alteration or loss of heterozygosity at the KRAS locus, and (iv) sequencing reads sample alleles in proportion to their underlying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) copy counts.\n\nUsing only the definition that the variant allele fraction (VAF) is the fraction of all alleles at the locus that carry the variant in the bulk mixture, compute the expected VAF for this KRAS mutation in the sample. Express your answer as a decimal fraction. No rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of the expected variant allele fraction (VAF) for a specific KRAS mutation in a heterogeneous tumor sample. The VAF is defined as the fraction of all alleles at a given genetic locus that carry the variant sequence. We can express this mathematically as:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{\\text{variant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{variant}}$ is the total number of variant alleles and $N_{\\text{total}}$ is the total number of alleles at that locus in the entire sample.\n\nThe sample is a bulk mixture composed of two main populations: normal stromal cells and cancer cells. The cancer cell population itself is heterogeneous, containing a subpopulation with the mutation and another without it. To compute the VAF, we must account for the allelic contribution of each cell type.\n\nLet's define the given parameters:\n- The fraction of cancer cells in the sample (tumor purity) is $P = 0.50$.\n- The fraction of normal cells in the sample is therefore $1 - P = 1 - 0.50 = 0.50$.\n- The fraction of cancer cells that harbor the mutation (subclone fraction) is $S_c = 0.20$.\n\nThe problem states that the KRAS gene is on an autosome and is diploid in all cells (both normal and cancer). This means every cell contains exactly $2$ copies (alleles) of the KRAS gene.\n\nLet's consider a representative total number of cells, $C$, in the biopsy. The total number of KRAS alleles in the sample is the total number of cells multiplied by the number of alleles per cell:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = C \\times 2\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the number of variant alleles, $N_{\\text{variant}}$. These alleles only exist in the mutated cancer cells.\nThe number of cancer cells in the sample is $C \\times P$.\nThe number of cancer cells that have the mutation is the number of cancer cells multiplied by the subclone fraction:\n$$\n\\text{Number of mutant cancer cells} = (C \\times P) \\times S_c\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the mutation is heterozygous in these cells. This means each mutant cell has one variant allele and one wild-type allele. Therefore, the number of variant alleles contributed by each mutant cancer cell is $1$.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample is:\n$$\nN_{\\text{variant}} = (\\text{Number of mutant cancer cells}) \\times (\\text{number of variant alleles per mutant cell})\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{variant}} = (C \\times P \\times S_c) \\times 1 = C \\times P \\times S_c\n$$\nNormal cells and non-mutant cancer cells are wild-type and contribute $0$ variant alleles.\n\nNow we can compute the VAF by substituting the expressions for $N_{\\text{variant}}$ and $N_{\\text{total}}$ into the VAF definition:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{\\text{variant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{C \\times P \\times S_c}{C \\times 2}\n$$\nThe total cell count $C$ cancels out, as the VAF is an intensive property of the mixture:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{P \\times S_c}{2}\n$$\nThis formula encapsulates the contributions of tumor purity ($P$), the fraction of cells carrying the mutation ($S_c$), the zygosity of the mutation (the numerator would be $P \\times S_c \\times 2$ for a homozygous mutation), and the overall ploidy of the locus (the denominator, representing the average number of alleles per cell in the sample, which is $2$ since all cells are diploid).\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n$P = 0.50$\n$S_c = 0.20$\n\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{0.50 \\times 0.20}{2} = \\frac{0.10}{2} = 0.05\n$$\nThe expected variant allele fraction for this KRAS mutation in the sample is $0.05$.",

            "introduction": "Having established how tumor biology dictates sequencing results, we now tackle the more common real-world task: inferring biological properties from the sequencing data itself. In this practice, you will use the measured variant allele fraction (VAF) from a colorectal cancer sample, along with an estimate of tumor purity, to deduce the cancer cell fraction ($f$) for a KRAS mutation. This analysis reveals whether the mutation is likely 'clonal'—an early driver event present in all tumor cells—a critical insight for understanding the cancer's evolutionary history .",

            "problem": "A surgically resected colorectal adenocarcinoma is profiled by targeted deep sequencing. At the proto-oncogene Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) locus, a Gly12Asp point mutation (G12D) is detected with an observed variant allele fraction (VAF) of $V=0.35$. Pathology and computational deconvolution estimate the tumor purity to be $0.70$, meaning a fraction $p=0.70$ of the DNA in the sample originates from tumor cells, with the remaining fraction $1-p$ from admixed normal tissue. Shallow whole-genome copy-number profiling indicates no copy-number alteration (CNA) at the KRAS locus in either the tumor or the normal compartment, so both compartments are diploid at this locus.\n\nUse only fundamental definitions:\n- Variant allele fraction (VAF) at a locus is the proportion of allelic reads carrying the variant among all reads at that locus in the bulk sample.\n- Tumor purity $p$ is the fraction of DNA originating from tumor cells.\n- Let $f$ denote the cancer cell fraction, the proportion of tumor cells that carry the KRAS mutation.\n- Let $m$ denote the mutant allele multiplicity, the number of mutant copies per mutated tumor cell at the locus.\n- Assume the normal cells do not carry the mutation.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the assumption of diploidy in both compartments at the locus, derive the general relationship linking the observed VAF $V$, the purity $p$, the cancer cell fraction $f$, and the mutant multiplicity $m$. Then, using the measured $V=0.35$, $p=0.70$, and assuming a heterozygous state at the locus ($m=1$) with no copy-number alteration, compute the inferred cancer cell fraction $f$.

Derivation of the General Relationship**\n\nThe variant allele fraction ($V$) is defined as the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles at a specific locus in a bulk sample.\n$$V = \\frac{\\text{number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{total number of alleles}}$$\nLet's model the contributions to the numerator and denominator from the different cell populations in the sample. The sample consists of a fraction $p$ of tumor cells and a fraction $(1-p)$ of normal cells.\n\n*   **Total Number of Alleles:** Both normal and tumor cells are diploid at the KRAS locus, meaning each cell has 2 alleles. The total number of alleles in the sample is proportional to the weighted average of alleles per cell:\n    $$ \\text{Total Alleles} \\propto p \\times (\\text{alleles in tumor cell}) + (1-p) \\times (\\text{alleles in normal cell}) $$\n    $$ \\text{Total Alleles} \\propto p \\times 2 + (1-p) \\times 2 = 2p + 2 - 2p = 2 $$\n\n*   **Number of Mutant Alleles:** The mutation is only present in the tumor cells. Within the tumor cell population (fraction $p$), a fraction $f$ of cells carry the mutation. Each of these mutated cells contains $m$ mutant alleles. Normal cells contain 0 mutant alleles.\n    $$ \\text{Mutant Alleles} \\propto p \\times f \\times m + (1-p) \\times 0 = pfm $$\n\nCombining these, we get the general relationship for VAF at a diploid locus:\n$$ V = \\frac{p \\times f \\times m}{2} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of Cancer Cell Fraction (f)**\n\nWe can now use this formula to solve for the cancer cell fraction, $f$. First, we rearrange the equation:\n$$ f = \\frac{2V}{pm} $$\n\nNext, we substitute the values given in the problem:\n- Observed variant allele fraction, $V = 0.35$\n- Tumor purity, $p = 0.70$\n- Mutant allele multiplicity, $m = 1$ (since the mutation is heterozygous in the diploid tumor cells)\n\n$$ f = \\frac{2 \\times 0.35}{0.70 \\times 1} $$\n$$ f = \\frac{0.70}{0.70} $$\n$$ f = 1 $$\n\nThe calculated cancer cell fraction is $1$. This result indicates that the KRAS G12D mutation is clonal, meaning it is present in 100% of the tumor cells in the sample.
