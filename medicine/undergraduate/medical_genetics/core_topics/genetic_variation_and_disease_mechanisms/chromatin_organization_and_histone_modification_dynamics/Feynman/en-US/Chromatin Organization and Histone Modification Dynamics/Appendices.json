This practice explores the fundamental concept of nucleosome \"breathing,\" where DNA transiently unwraps from the histone core, using a simple but powerful two-state equilibrium model. By working through this problem, you will learn to quantify \"chromatin accessibility\" at its most basic level and see how post-translational modifications can shift this equilibrium to control DNA access for regulatory proteins .",

            "problem": "A simplified two-state model of nucleosome dynamics treats each nucleosome as occupying either a wrapped state $W$ or an unwrapped state $U$. In equilibrium, the unwrapping equilibrium constant $K_u$ is defined by $K_u = \\frac{[U]}{[W]}$, where $[U]$ and $[W]$ denote the equilibrium occupancies (or probabilities) of the unwrapped and wrapped states, respectively. Accessibility is operationally defined as the probability that a nucleosome is in the unwrapped state. Begin from the core facts that (i) equilibrium constants relate state occupancies in two-state systems by $K = \\frac{p_{\\text{state 2}}}{p_{\\text{state 1}}}$, and (ii) probabilities sum to one in a complete two-state system, so $p_U + p_W = 1$. Derive an expression for accessibility $A(K_u)$ as a function of $K_u$, and then use this expression to compute the absolute change in accessibility $\\Delta A = A(K_u^{\\text{acetylated}}) - A(K_u^{\\text{unacetylated}})$ when histone acetylation increases the equilibrium constant from $K_u^{\\text{unacetylated}} = 0.05$ to $K_u^{\\text{acetylated}} = 0.2$. Round your final numerical answer for $\\Delta A$ to four significant figures. Express the answer as a unitless decimal. Additionally, discuss how sensitive $A(K_u)$ is to changes in $K_u$ by deriving $\\frac{dA}{dK_u}$ and interpreting its value at the two given $K_u$ values, but report only the single numerical value for $\\Delta A$ as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The system is defined by two relationships: the equilibrium constant $K_u = \\frac{p_U}{p_W}$ and the conservation of probability $p_U + p_W = 1$, where $p_U$ and $p_W$ are the probabilities of the unwrapped and wrapped states, respectively. Accessibility is defined as $A \\equiv p_U$.\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $A$ as a function of $K_u$. We substitute $A$ for $p_U$ and use the conservation equation to write $p_W = 1 - A$. Substituting this into the equilibrium constant definition gives:\n$$K_u = \\frac{A}{1 - A}$$\nWe solve this equation for $A$:\n$$K_u (1 - A) = A$$\n$$K_u - K_u A = A$$\n$$K_u = A(1 + K_u)$$\n$$A(K_u) = \\frac{K_u}{1 + K_u}$$\nThis is the expression for accessibility as a function of the unwrapping equilibrium constant.\n\nNext, we calculate the accessibility for the unacetylated state ($K_u = 0.05$) and the acetylated state ($K_u = 0.2$):\n$$A^{\\text{unacetylated}} = A(0.05) = \\frac{0.05}{1 + 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{1.05} = \\frac{1}{21}$$\n$$A^{\\text{acetylated}} = A(0.2) = \\frac{0.2}{1 + 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{1.2} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\nThe absolute change in accessibility, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between these two values:\n$$\\Delta A = A^{\\text{acetylated}} - A^{\\text{unacetylated}} = \\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{1}{21}$$\nUsing a common denominator of 42:\n$$\\Delta A = \\frac{7}{42} - \\frac{2}{42} = \\frac{5}{42}$$\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, this is:\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 0.1190$$\nThe sensitivity analysis requested involves deriving $\\frac{dA}{dK_u}$. Using the quotient rule:\n$$\\frac{dA}{dK_u} = \\frac{1}{(1 + K_u)^2}$$\nThis derivative shows that sensitivity is higher for smaller $K_u$, meaning accessibility is more responsive to changes when the nucleosome is initially more stable (wrapped).",

Assume first-order kinetics under mass-action for both the addition of ubiquitin by ubiquitin ligases and its removal by deubiquitinating enzymes, with constant per-molecule rates.

This final practice connects local chromatin dynamics to the ultimate functional output: gene expression.

            "problem": "A lineage-specific enhancer situated within a topologically associating domain is insulated from its target promoter by CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) boundaries. Removal of this insulation increases the enhancer–promoter spatial contact probability per observation window from $p_{\\mathrm{insulated}} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $p_{\\mathrm{uninsulated}} = 6 \\times 10^{-4}$. In a simplified biophysical model of gene regulation, the promoter switches between an OFF state and an ON state. The ON state corresponds to a chromatin configuration enriched for histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation ($H_3K27ac$) deposited by CREB-binding protein (CBP) and E1A-binding protein p300 (p300) during enhancer contact, while the OFF state corresponds to deacetylated chromatin maintained by histone deacetylases. Assume the following foundational elements:\n\n- The promoter exists in two states, ON and OFF, and at steady state the fraction of time in the ON state equals the relative statistical weight of the ON state divided by the sum of weights of ON and OFF states.\n- Enhancer contact promotes ON-state formation in a cooperative manner requiring $n$ independent contact-mediated recruitment events before productive transcriptional initiation can occur.\n- Let $K$ be an effective contact-probability scale at which the ON and OFF states have equal statistical weight in the absence of additional biases.\n\nUsing these principles, derive an expression for the normalized transcriptional output $E(p)$ as a function of the contact probability $p$, the cooperativity order $n$, and the threshold $K$, and then compute the ratio of steady-state expression after insulation removal to before insulation removal, $E(p_{\\mathrm{uninsulated}})/E(p_{\\mathrm{insulated}})$, for $n = 2$ and $K = 2 \\times 10^{-4}$. In your reasoning, first quantify the expected change in contact frequency due to insulation removal, and then link contact probability to expression via your derived nonlinear mapping.

            "solution": "We begin from a two-state description of promoter activity. Let the promoter have an OFF state and an ON state. At steady state, the normalized transcriptional output $E$ equals the fraction of time in the ON state. From statistical equilibrium, the ON-state probability equals the relative statistical weight of the ON state divided by the sum of the weights of ON and OFF states.\n\nTo link the enhancer–promoter contact probability $p$ to these weights, we posit cooperative activation requiring $n$ independent contact-mediated recruitment events. If each event scales with the availability of contact with probability $p$, the relative propensity of forming the ON state scales as $p^{n}$. Introducing an effective threshold $K$ that sets the scale where ON and OFF have equal weight, the ratio of ON to OFF statistical weights becomes\n$$\nR(p) = \\left(\\frac{p}{K}\\right)^{n}.\n$$\nThis form ensures that when $p = K$, $R(p) = 1$, so the ON and OFF states are equally likely. The steady-state fraction in the ON state, which is the normalized expression $E(p)$, is then\n$$\nE(p) = \\frac{R(p)}{1 + R(p)} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{p}{K}\\right)^{n}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{p}{K}\\right)^{n}} = \\frac{p^{n}}{K^{n} + p^{n}}.\n$$\n\nNext, we quantify the expected change in contact frequency upon insulation removal. The contact probability increases from $p_{\\mathrm{insulated}} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$ to $p_{\\mathrm{uninsulated}} = 6 \\times 10^{-4}$.

When $p \\ll K$, the mapping is strongly sublinear ($E(p) \\approx p^{n}/K^{n}$), while for $p \\gg K$ it approaches saturation ($E(p) \\approx 1$). Here, $p_{\\mathrm{insulated}} < K$ but $p_{\\mathrm{uninsulated}} > K$, placing the system in a regime where additional increases in contact probability produce diminishing returns in expression.\n\nRounding the final ratio to three significant figures yields $4.50$.",
