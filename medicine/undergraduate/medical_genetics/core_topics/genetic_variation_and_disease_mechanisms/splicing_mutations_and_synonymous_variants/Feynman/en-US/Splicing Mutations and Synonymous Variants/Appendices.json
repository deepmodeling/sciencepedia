This first exercise explores the direct consequence of such an event on the resulting protein. By applying the fundamental principle of the triplet genetic code, you will determine whether an exon skipping event maintains the protein's reading frame and quantify the damage to a critical functional domain, providing a tangible link between a splicing error and its impact on protein structure and function .",

            "problem": "A hypothetical serine/threonine protein kinase gene contains a synonymous single-nucleotide variant within exon $12$ that is predicted, by splicing assays, to cause complete skipping of exon $12$. Exon $12$ has length $93$ nucleotides ($\\mathrm{nt}$). The canonical protein is $520$ amino acids ($\\mathrm{aa}$) long, and the kinase catalytic domain spans residues $170$ through $410$ (inclusive). In the canonical transcript, exon $12$ encodes residues $210$ through $240$ (inclusive).\n\nUsing only foundational principles, including the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (CDMB) and the definition that translation proceeds by reading codons of length $3$ nucleotides per amino acid, determine whether the exon $12$ skipping event preserves the reading frame and deduce the immediate amino acid change. Then, quantify its domain impact as follows: let $f$ be the fraction of the kinase catalytic domain removed by this exon skipping event, defined as the number of amino acids deleted within the catalytic domain divided by the total number of amino acids in the catalytic domain.\n\nReport $f$ as a decimal, rounding your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The solution proceeds by applying foundational principles of molecular biology to the provided data.\n\n**Part 1: Reading Frame Preservation**\nThe first step is to determine if the skipping of exon $12$ preserves the translational reading frame. The reading frame is maintained if the number of nucleotides deleted is a multiple of $3$. The problem states that exon $12$, which is skipped in its entirety, has a length of $93$ nucleotides. We check if $93$ is divisible by $3$:\n$$\n\\frac{93}{3} = 31\n$$\nSince $93$ is an integer multiple of $3$, the deletion of exon $12$ from the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript is an in-frame deletion. This means that the codons in the downstream exon (exon $13$) will be read in the correct frame, and translation will continue normally after the deletion. The immediate amino acid change is the deletion of the $31$ amino acids encoded by exon $12$. This is consistent with the problem statement, which says exon $12$ encodes residues $210$ through $240$ ($240 - 210 + 1 = 31$ amino acids).\n\n**Part 2: Quantification of Domain Impact**\nThe main task is to calculate the fraction, $f$, of the kinase catalytic domain that is removed by this exon skipping event. The fraction $f$ is defined as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}}{N_{\\text{domain}}}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}$ is the number of amino acids deleted that are within the catalytic domain, and $N_{\\text{domain}}$ is the total number of amino acids in the catalytic domain.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of amino acids in the catalytic domain, $N_{\\text{domain}}$. The domain spans residues $170$ to $410$, inclusive.\n$$\nN_{\\text{domain}} = 410 - 170 + 1 = 241 \\text{ amino acids}\n$$\nNext, we determine the number of deleted amino acids that lie within this domain, $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}}$. The deleted residues are from position $210$ to $240$. The domain spans from position $170$ to $410$. The interval of deleted residues is $[210, 240]$. The interval of the catalytic domain is $[170, 410]$. Since $170 \\le 210$ and $240 \\le 410$, the entire block of $31$ deleted amino acids is located within the catalytic domain.\nTherefore, $N_{\\text{deleted\\_in\\_domain}} = 31$.\n\nNow we can calculate the fraction $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{31}{241}\n$$\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the decimal value of this fraction and round it to four significant figures.\n$$\nf \\approx 0.128630705...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nf \\approx 0.1286\n$$\nThis result indicates that approximately $12.86\\%$ of the kinase catalytic domain is removed, which would almost certainly lead to a non-functional or severely impaired enzyme.",

            "introduction": "Altered splicing does not just risk producing a non-functional protein; it can also create transcripts that are actively targeted for destruction by the cell. This practice introduces the crucial quality control pathway of Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD), which degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons.

            "problem": "A protein-coding gene comprised of multiple exons undergoes pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing to form mature messenger RNA (mRNA), in accordance with the Central Dogma of molecular biology. A synonymous single-nucleotide variant within a coding exon disrupts an exonic splicing enhancer, leading to exon skipping during splicing. The skipping event removes $87$ nucleotides from the coding sequence. This altered splicing pattern results in a premature termination codon (PTC) located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction in the mature mRNA.\n\nRecall the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) model of Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD): during splicing, EJCs are deposited on mRNA approximately one EJC per exon–exon junction, and a widely observed rule is that NMD is generally elicited if the ribosome terminates at a PTC located more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of the final exon–exon junction, leaving at least one downstream EJC bound during the pioneering round of translation.\n\nUsing this EJC-based framework, determine whether NMD is expected for the described transcript by computing an indicator variable $I$ defined as $I = 1$ if NMD is expected and $I = 0$ if NMD is not expected. Derive your answer from first principles of splicing, EJC deposition, and NMD triggering, and explicitly justify why the chosen threshold applies. Express the final answer as the single number $I$. No rounding is required; $I$ is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "This problem requires an assessment of whether a specific mRNA transcript, altered by an exon skipping event, will be targeted for degradation by the Nonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway. The decision is based on the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) model of NMD.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental principles. In eukaryotes, after introns are spliced out of a pre-mRNA, a multi-protein complex known as the Exon Junction Complex (EJC) is deposited on the mRNA approximately $20$ to $24$ nucleotides upstream of each newly formed exon-exon junction. These EJCs serve as markers of the splicing process and are cleared by the ribosome during the first (\"pioneer\") round of translation.\n\nNonsense-Mediated Decay (NMD) is a surveillance pathway that detects and degrades mRNAs containing premature termination codons (PTCs). The trigger for NMD is the presence of an EJC remaining on the mRNA after the ribosome has terminated translation at a PTC. This occurs if the PTC is located sufficiently far upstream of an EJC, such that the terminating ribosome does not displace it.\n\nThe problem provides a specific rule for NMD activation: NMD is elicited if the ribosome terminates at a PTC located more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides upstream of a downstream exon-exon junction. This distance ensures that the terminating ribosome complex is unable to interact with and displace the EJC associated with that downstream junction. The presence of this \"leftover\" EJC on the mRNA is the signal that recruits the NMD machinery to degrade the transcript.\n\nLet us analyze the specific data provided in the problem statement.\n1.  A synonymous variant leads to exon skipping. This is a known mechanism where a mutation alters a splicing regulatory element. The problem states the skipped exon has a length of $87$ nucleotides. Since $87$ is a multiple of $3$ ($87 = 3 \\times 29$), this would typically result in an in-frame deletion. However, the problem explicitly states that a PTC is formed, which is plausible if the new junction of flanking exons creates a stop codon. The existence of the PTC is a given premise.\n2.  The PTC is located $120$ nucleotides upstream of the *final* exon–exon junction in the mature mRNA. Let's define this distance as $d_{PTC}$. So, $d_{PTC} = 120$ nucleotides.\n3.  The NMD trigger threshold is a PTC-to-junction distance of more than $50$ to $55$ nucleotides. Let's denote the critical threshold distance as $d_{threshold}$. We can use the more conservative upper bound of this range, meaning NMD is triggered if $d_{PTC} > 55$ nucleotides.\n\nWe must now compare the given position of the PTC with the threshold for NMD.\nThe distance of the PTC from the final exon-exon junction is $d_{PTC} = 120$ nucleotides.\nThe threshold distance for triggering NMD is $d_{threshold} = 55$ nucleotides.\n\nThe condition for NMD activation is $d_{PTC} > d_{threshold}$.\nSubstituting the values, we evaluate the inequality:\n$$120 > 55$$\nThis inequality is true. The PTC is located significantly further upstream of the final exon-exon junction than the critical threshold distance. Consequently, during the pioneering round of translation, the ribosome will terminate at the PTC and dissociate from the mRNA without displacing the EJC associated with that final junction. The persistence of this EJC on the mRNA will signal that the transcript is aberrant, leading to its degradation via the NMD pathway.\n\nTherefore, NMD is expected for the described transcript.\n\nThe problem asks for an indicator variable $I$, where $I=1$ if NMD is expected and $I=0$ if NMD is not expected. Based on our analysis, NMD is expected.\nThus, the value of the indicator variable is $I=1$.",

The mutation from `GAA` to `GAG` is synonymous, as both codons specify glutamic acid. However, we calculated a non-zero change in the total ESE score, $\\Delta S \\approx -0.2231$. Within this model, the ESE score reflects the binding affinity of a splicing regulatory protein. A change in this score implies a change in splicing regulation. The negative value of $\\Delta S$ suggests a weakening of the ESE, which could reduce the inclusion of the exon and lead to disease. This demonstrates that the nucleotide sequence carries regulatory information for splicing that is distinct from its protein-coding function.",
