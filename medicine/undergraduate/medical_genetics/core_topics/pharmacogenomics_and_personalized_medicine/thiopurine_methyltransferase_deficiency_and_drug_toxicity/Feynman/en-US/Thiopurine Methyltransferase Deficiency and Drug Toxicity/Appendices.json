This exercise  will guide you through a calculation that demonstrates how a variant-associated reduction in $V_{\\max}$ directly translates into a decreased rate of drug metabolism, providing a clear biochemical basis for the observed clinical phenotype.",

            "problem": "Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes methylation of thiopurine drugs such as 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP), generating inactive metabolites. In medical genetics, allelic variation in TPMT can reduce catalytic capacity and thereby increase intracellular levels of cytotoxic thioguanine nucleotides. Consider a single-substrate, enzyme-catalyzed reaction under steady-state conditions in which TPMT methylates 6-MP. The wild-type TPMT has catalytic parameters $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}}=100$ units and $K_{m,\\mathrm{WT}}=50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. A variant TPMT associated with drug toxicity has $V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}}=25$ units with the same $K_{m,\\mathrm{VAR}}=50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.

The context of TPMT deficiency and its impact on thiopurine drug metabolism is scientifically accurate and a classic example in pharmacogenetics. All necessary parameters ($V_{\\max}$, $K_m$, $[S]$) are provided, and their values and units are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, as a unique solution can be derived from the provided information. The language is precise and objective. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or scientific flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe velocity of a single-substrate enzyme-catalyzed reaction under steady-state conditions is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nwhere $v$ is the reaction velocity, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum velocity, $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant, and $[S]$ is the substrate concentration.\n\nWe apply this equation to both the wild-type (WT) and variant (VAR) forms of the enzyme TPMT.\n\nFor the wild-type enzyme, the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}} [S]}{K_{m,\\mathrm{WT}} + [S]} $$\nFor the variant enzyme, the velocity $v_{\\mathrm{VAR}}$ is:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}} [S]}{K_{m,\\mathrm{VAR}} + [S]} $$\nThe problem asks for the relative methylation velocity, which is the ratio $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{VAR}}}{v_{\\mathrm{WT}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_{\\mathrm{VAR}}$ and $v_{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}} [S]}{K_{m,\\mathrm{VAR}} + [S]}}{\\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}} [S]}{K_{m,\\mathrm{WT}} + [S]}} $$\nFrom the problem statement, we have $K_{m,\\mathrm{WT}} = K_{m,\\mathrm{VAR}}$. Let's denote this common Michaelis constant as $K_m$. The expression for $R$ can be simplified:\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\times \\frac{K_m + [S]}{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}} [S]} $$\nThe terms $(K_m + [S])$ and $[S]$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}}}{V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}}} $$\nThis shows that when the $K_m$ values are identical, the ratio of the reaction velocities is independent of the substrate concentration and is equal to the ratio of their maximum velocities.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$V_{\\max,\\mathrm{WT}} = 100$ units\n$V_{\\max,\\mathrm{VAR}} = 25$ units\n\n$$ R = \\frac{25}{100} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a unitless decimal rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as:\n$$ R = 0.2500 $$\nAs a verification, we can also calculate the individual velocities first.\nGiven $[S] = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $K_m = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{(100)(100)}{50 + 100} = \\frac{10000}{150} = \\frac{200}{3} \\text{ units} $$\n$$ v_{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{(25)(100)}{50 + 100} = \\frac{2500}{150} = \\frac{50}{3} \\text{ units} $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ R = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{VAR}}}{v_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{50/3}{200/3} = \\frac{50}{200} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nThis confirms the previous result. Expressed with four significant figures, the answer is $0.2500$.",
