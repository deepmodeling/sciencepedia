            "problem": "A morphogen involved in key developmental signaling pathways such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP), or Wingless-related integration site (Wnt) often establishes positional information by forming a concentration gradient. Consider a one-dimensional tissue in which a morphogen is produced at a localized source at $x=0$, diffuses with diffusion coefficient $D$ and is removed by first-order degradation with rate constant $k$. At steady state, conservation of mass together with Fickian diffusion and first-order degradation yields the partial differential equation\n$$D \\nabla^{2} C(x) - k\\,C(x) + S\\,\\delta(x) = 0,$$\nwhere $C(x)$ is the morphogen concentration, $S$ is the source strength, and $\\delta(x)$ is the Dirac delta function representing the localized source.\n\nStarting from the above steady-state equation and using only physically justified boundary conditions (finite concentration as $|x|\\to \\infty$), do the following:\n- Derive the one-dimensional concentration profile $C(x)$ for $x>0$ and identify the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$ that emerges from the diffusion-degradation balance. Your derivation must start from the differential equation and appropriate boundary and matching conditions, without invoking pre-memorized solution forms.\n- Using the jump condition implied by the Dirac delta term, relate the near-source amplitude $C_{0} \\equiv C(0^{+})$ to the source strength $S$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, and the degradation rate constant $k$.\n- Define a positional threshold $C_{T}$ for target cell fate specification and, using your derived profile, obtain the exact analytic expression for the position $x_{T}$ at which $C(x_{T}) = C_{T}$.\n\nFinally, report only the closed-form analytic expression for $x_{T}$ as a function of $D$, $k$, $C_{0}$, and $C_{T}$.

The equation becomes $D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC = 0$.\n        *   This is a homogeneous second-order linear ODE.\n        *   The characteristic equation is $D r^2 - k = 0$, which gives $r^2 = k/D$.\n        *   The roots are $r = \\pm \\sqrt{k/D}$.\n        *   The general solution is $C(x) = A \\exp(\\sqrt{k/D}x) + B \\exp(-\\sqrt{k/D}x)$.\n        *   Let's define the characteristic length scale $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This simplifies the solution to $C(x) = A \\exp(x/\\lambda) + B \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Now apply the boundary conditions. The problem is symmetric around $x=0$, so we can solve for $x>0$ and use symmetry.\n        *   For $x > 0$, the boundary condition is that $C(x)$ must be finite as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $A \\exp(x/\\lambda)$ diverges as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, we must have $A=0$.\n        *   So, for $x > 0$, the solution has the form $C(x) = C_R \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $C_R$ is a constant.\n        *   Similarly, for $x < 0$, the boundary condition is that $C(x)$ must be finite as $x \\to -\\infty$. The term $B \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ diverges. So, we must have $B=0$.\n        *   The solution for $x < 0$ has the form $C(x) = C_L \\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Due to the symmetry of the problem (source at origin, uniform medium), we expect $C(x) = C(-x)$. This implies $C_L = C_R$. Let's call this constant $C_0$.\n        *   So, the general solution for all $x \\neq 0$ is $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Note that $C_0$ is the concentration at $x=0$. More precisely, $C_0 = C(0^+) = C(0^-)$. This matches the definition in the problem.\n        *   The characteristic length scale is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$. This is the distance over which the concentration decays by a factor of $1/e$. It represents the balance between diffusion (which spreads the morphogen) and degradation (which removes it).\n\n    *   **Part 2: Relate C₀ to S, D, and k**\n        *   To find the constant $C_0$, we need to use the source term $S\\delta(x)$. We integrate the full differential equation over a small interval around the origin, from $-\\epsilon$ to $+\\epsilon$, and then take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$.\n        *   $\\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\left( D \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} - kC(x) + S\\delta(x) \\right) dx = 0$.\n        *   $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} dx - k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx + S \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = 0$.\n        *   Let's evaluate each term:\n            *   $D \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{d^2 C}{dx^2} dx = D \\left[ \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right]_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} = D \\left( \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=\\epsilon} - \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=-\\epsilon} \\right)$. This is the jump in the flux at the origin.\n            *   $-k \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} C(x) dx$. As $\\epsilon \\to 0$, if $C(x)$ is finite at $x=0$, this integral goes to zero. $C(x)$ is continuous at $x=0$, so this term vanishes.\n            *   $S \\int_{-\\epsilon}^{\\epsilon} \\delta(x) dx = S \\times 1 = S$.\n        *   So, in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the equation becomes: $D \\left( \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^+} - \\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^-} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   This is the \"jump condition\" for the derivative.\n        *   Now we need the derivatives of our solution $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-|x|/\\lambda)$.\n            *   For $x > 0$, $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n            *   At $x=0^+$, $\\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^+} = -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda}$.\n            *   For $x < 0$, $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(x/\\lambda)$, so $\\frac{dC}{dx} = \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(x/\\lambda)$.\n            *   At $x=0^-$, $\\left. \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right|_{x=0^-} = \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   Substitute these into the jump condition:\n        *   $D \\left( -\\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} - \\frac{C_0}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   $D \\left( -\\frac{2C_0}{\\lambda} \\right) + S = 0$.\n        *   $S = \\frac{2DC_0}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   We need to relate $C_0$ to $S, D, k$. So rearrange: $C_0 = \\frac{S\\lambda}{2D}$.\n        *   Substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$: $C_0 = \\frac{S \\sqrt{D/k}}{2D} = \\frac{S}{2D} \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$.\n        *   This gives the relationship between the peak concentration $C_0$ and the system parameters. The problem asks to relate $C_0$ to $S, D, k$, which we have done. Let's explicitly check the problem statement: \"relate the near-source amplitude $C_{0} \\equiv C(0^{+})$ to the source strength $S$, the diffusion coefficient $D$, and the degradation rate constant $k$\". This is it.\n\n    *   **Part 3: Find x_T**\n        *   We have the concentration profile for $x > 0$: $C(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.\n        *   We are given a threshold concentration $C_T$. We need to find the position $x_T$ where $C(x_T) = C_T$.\n        *   $C_T = C_0 \\exp(-x_T/\\lambda)$.\n        *   We need to solve for $x_T$.\n        *   $\\frac{C_T}{C_0} = \\exp(-x_T/\\lambda)$.\n        *   Take the natural logarithm of both sides: $\\ln \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right) = -\\frac{x_T}{\\lambda}$.\n        *   $x_T = -\\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right)$.\n        *   Using log properties, $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\left( \\frac{C_T}{C_0} \\right)^{-1} \\right) = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   This makes physical sense: since $C_T < C_0$ for a boundary to exist, the argument of the logarithm is greater than 1, and $x_T$ is positive.\n\n    *   **Part 4: Final expression for x_T and robustness explanation**\n        *   The problem asks for $x_T$ as a function of $D, k, C_0, C_T$.\n        *   We have $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   We need to substitute $\\lambda = \\sqrt{D/k}$.\n        *   So, $x_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}} \\ln \\left( \\frac{C_0}{C_T} \\right)$.\n        *   This is the final analytical expression for $x_T$. The variables are $D, k, C_0, C_T$. This is exactly what the problem asks for.\n\n    *   **Part 5: Robustness explanation**\n        *   The question asks how $\\lambda$ influences the robustness of positional information.\n        *   The position of the threshold, $x_T$, is given by $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C_T)$.\n        *   Positional information is \"robust\" if the position $x_T$ is insensitive to fluctuations in the parameters, particularly the source strength $S$.\n        *   Let's look at the sensitivity of $x_T$ to changes in $S$. From Part 2, we found $C_0 = \\frac{S}{2\\sqrt{Dk}}$.\n        *   Substitute this into the expression for $x_T$:\n            $x_T = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{S / (2\\sqrt{Dk})}{C_T} \\right) = \\lambda \\ln \\left( \\frac{S}{2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk}} \\right)$.\n        *   The position $x_T$ depends logarithmically on the source strength $S$.\n        *   Let's calculate the sensitivity of $x_T$ to a change in source strength $S$ by computing the derivative $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S}$.\n        *   $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} = \\lambda \\frac{1}{S / (2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk})} \\frac{1}{2 C_T \\sqrt{Dk}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{S}$.\n        *   So, a small change $\\Delta S$ leads to a change $\\Delta x_T \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{S} \\Delta S$.\n        *   The absolute shift in the boundary position $x_T$ is directly proportional to $\\lambda$. So a larger $\\lambda$ (a longer gradient) leads to a larger absolute shift in the boundary for the same fluctuation in source strength $S$.\n        *   This means that a system with a smaller characteristic length $\\lambda$ (steeper gradient) is more robust in the sense that the absolute positions of its boundaries are less affected by fluctuations in the source production rate $S$.\n        *   This seems like a solid, principled explanation grounded in the derivation.\n        *   So, the explanation should be:\n                1.  The derived expression is $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C_T)$.\n                2.  The peak concentration is $C_0 = S/(2\\sqrt{Dk}) = S\\lambda/(2D)$.\n                3.  So $x_T = \\lambda \\ln(S\\lambda / (2DC_T))$.\n                4.  The sensitivity of $x_T$ to a change in source strength $S$ is given by the derivative $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S}$.\n                5.  $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} = \\lambda \\frac{1}{S\\lambda / (2DC_T)} \\frac{\\lambda}{2DC_T} = \\lambda \\frac{2DC_T}{S\\lambda} \\frac{\\lambda}{2DC_T} = \\frac{\\lambda}{S}$.\n                6.  For a small fluctuation $\\Delta S$ in the source, the shift in boundary position is $\\Delta x_T \\approx \\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial S} \\Delta S = \\frac{\\lambda}{S} \\Delta S$.\n                7.  This shows that the absolute shift $\\Delta x_T$ is directly proportional to the characteristic length scale $\\lambda$.\n                8.  Therefore, a smaller $\\lambda$ (resulting from lower diffusion $D$ or higher degradation $k$) creates a steeper gradient that is more robust to fluctuations in source strength, meaning the absolute position of the threshold boundary shifts less.\n                9.  What about tissue properties $D,k$? They affect $\\lambda$ itself. We want robustness of $x_T$ to fluctuations in $D,k$.\n                    *   $\\frac{\\partial x_T}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{C_0} \\frac{\\partial C_0}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + \\lambda \\frac{1}{S\\lambda/2D} \\frac{S}{2D} = \\ln(C_0/C_T) + 1$.\n                    *   Since $\\lambda = (D/k)^{1/2}$, fluctuations in $D$ and $k$ cause fluctuations in $\\lambda$.\n                    *   The shift $\\Delta x_T \\approx (\\ln(C_0/C_T) + 1)\\Delta \\lambda$. The position of the boundary is quite sensitive to fluctuations in the parameters that define the length scale itself. This is expected.\n                10. The question specifically asks about robustness to fluctuations in *source strength and tissue properties*. The relationship $\\Delta x_T \\propto \\lambda \\frac{\\Delta S}{S}$ is the key insight for source strength. A smaller $\\lambda$ improves robustness against source fluctuations.\n                11. A smaller $\\lambda$ also implies a steeper gradient, which means that any noise in the *reading* of the concentration $C$ by a cell translates into a smaller error in the inferred position $x$. Let's quantify this. From $C = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, we get $x = \\lambda \\ln(C_0/C)$. So $\\frac{dx}{dC} = \\lambda ( \\frac{1}{C_0/C} ) (-\\frac{C_0}{C^2}) = -\\frac{\\lambda}{C}$. So $\\Delta x \\approx -\\frac{\\lambda}{C} \\Delta C$, or $|\\Delta x| \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{C} |\\Delta C|$. The positional error due to noise in concentration reading is proportional to $\\lambda$. Again, a smaller $\\lambda$ is more robust.\n\nOk, this all seems consistent. I have a clear path for the derivation and the explanation. I will write it all out following the specified formatting rules. Every number, variable, symbol needs to be in LaTeX. All looks good.

Let $C_c$ and $C_n$ denote the steady-state concentrations.\n$$ \\frac{dC_c}{dt} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dC_n}{dt} = 0 $$\n\nThis yields a system of two linear algebraic equations:\n1.  $0 = P + k_{\\text{out}}C_n - (k_{\\text{in}} + k_{\\deg,c})C_c$\n2.  $0 = k_{\\text{in}}C_c - (k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})C_n$\n\nTo find the expression for $C_n$, we can first solve equation (2) for $C_c$:\n$$ k_{\\text{in}}C_c = (k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})C_n $$\n$$ C_c = \\frac{k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n}}{k_{\\text{in}}} C_n $$\n\nNext, substitute this expression for $C_c$ into equation (1):\n$$ 0 = P + k_{\\text{out}}C_n - (k_{\\text{in}} + k_{\\deg,c})\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n}}{k_{\\text{in}}} C_n\\right) $$\n\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $C_n$:\n$$ P = (k_{\\text{in}} + k_{\\deg,c})\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n}}{k_{\\text{in}}}\\right)C_n - k_{\\text{out}}C_n $$\n$$ P = \\left[ \\frac{(k_{\\text{in}} + k_{\\deg,c})(k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})}{k_{\\text{in}}} - k_{\\text{out}} \\right] C_n $$\n\nTo simplify the term in the brackets:\n$$ \\frac{(k_{\\text{in}} + k_{\\deg,c})(k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n}) - k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\text{out}}}{k_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\deg,n} + k_{\\deg,c}k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,c}k_{\\deg,n} - k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\text{out}}}{k_{\\text{in}}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\deg,n} + k_{\\deg,c}k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,c}k_{\\deg,n}}{k_{\\text{in}}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\deg,n} + k_{\\deg,c}(k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})}{k_{\\text{in}}} $$\n\nSubstituting this simplified term back into the equation for $P$:\n$$ P = \\left( \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\deg,n} + k_{\\deg,c}(k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})}{k_{\\text{in}}} \\right) C_n $$\n\nFinally, isolating $C_n$ gives the desired expression:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{P \\cdot k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{in}}k_{\\deg,n} + k_{\\deg,c}(k_{\\text{out}} + k_{\\deg,n})} $$\n\nThis completes the first part of the task. Now, we compute the numerical value for $C_n$ under the specified condition. The wild-type cytosolic degradation rate is $k_{\\deg,c} = 1.3\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$. An APC loss-of-function reduces this by $50\\%$. The new rate, which we will call $k'_{\\deg,c}$, is:\n$$ k'_{\\deg,c} = (1 - 0.5) \\cdot k_{\\deg,c} = 0.5 \\cdot 1.3\\ \\text{min}^{-1} = 0.65\\ \\text{min}^{-1} $$\n\nThe other parameters remain unchanged:\n- $P = 10\\ \\text{nM}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{in}} = 1.0\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\text{out}} = 0.5\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n- $k_{\\deg,n} = 0.2\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $C_n$, using $k'_{\\deg,c}$ in place of $k_{\\deg,c}$:\n$$ C_n = \\frac{10 \\cdot 1.0}{(1.0 \\cdot 0.2) + 0.65(0.5 + 0.2)} $$\n$$ C_n = \\frac{10}{0.2 + 0.65(0.7)} $$\n$$ C_n = \\frac{10}{0.2 + 0.455} $$\n$$ C_n = \\frac{10}{0.655} $$\n$$ C_n \\approx 15.26717557... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ C_n \\approx 15.27 $$\nThe units are in $\\text{nM}$, as expected.",

The French Flag model proposes that cells activate different gene programs based on whether the local morphogen concentration crosses specific thresholds. In this final practice, you will apply this concept to the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gradient in the developing limb bud to see how digit identities are specified, and you will quantitatively explore how altering the cellular *interpretation* of the gradient can lead to a clinically significant developmental abnormality like polydactyly (the formation of extra digits).

            "problem": "In vertebrate limb development, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) acts as a posteriorly localized morphogen along the posterior-to-anterior axis of the limb bud. A standard one-dimensional steady-state diffusion-decay field from a localized source yields a monotonically decreasing concentration profile $c(x)$ of the form $c(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ for $0 \\le x \\le L$, where $C_0$ is the posterior concentration at $x=0$, $\\lambda$ is the decay length, and $L$ is the anterior boundary of the field. In a multi-threshold decoding model (French flag model), digit identities are specified by $N$ monotonically decreasing decoding thresholds $T_i$ for $i=1,\\dots,N$, with $T_{i+1} < T_i$, and identities are assigned to spatial intervals where $c(x)$ lies between successive thresholds.\n\nConsider a geometric threshold series $T_i = T_0 r^{i-1}$ with $0<r<1$. Starting from the stated gradient and threshold definitions (and no other shortcut formulas), derive the general expression for the boundary positions $x_i$ at which $c(x)=T_i$, and use this to infer the condition under which a given threshold is realized within the limb domain $[0,L]$. Then, model a uniform decoder shift in which every threshold is multiplied by a factor $s>0$ (for example, due to altered transcriptional activator/repressor balance downstream of Shh), and determine the minimal $s$ that increases by exactly one the number of realized identity boundaries within $[0,L]$ (i.e., produces one additional digit domain).\n\nUse the parameters $C_0 = 12$ concentration units, $\\lambda = 0.25$ millimeters, $L = 1.0$ millimeters, $T_0 = 6$ concentration units, $r = 0.5$, and $N = 6$. Express your final answer for $s$ as a pure number without units, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated against the required criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Morphogen concentration profile: $c(x) = C_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$ for $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n-   Posterior concentration at $x=0$: $C_0$.\n-   Decay length: $\\lambda$.\n-   Anterior boundary: $L$.\n-   Decoding thresholds: $T_i = T_0 r^{i-1}$ for $i=1,\\dots,N$.\n-   Threshold ordering: $T_{i+1} < T_i$ (implies $0<r<1$).\n-   Boundary positions: $x_i$ defined by $c(x_i) = T_i$.\n-   Domain of interest: $[0,L]$.\n-   Decoder shift: New thresholds $T'_i = s \\cdot T_i$ with $s>0$.\n-   Objective: Find the minimal $s$ that increases the number of realized boundaries within $[0,L]$ by exactly one.\n-   Parameters: $C_0 = 12$, $\\lambda = 0.25$, $L = 1.0$, $T_0 = 6$, $r = 0.5$, $N = 6$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is based on the French flag model of morphogen interpretation and a standard one-dimensional diffusion-decay equation. This is a canonical and scientifically sound model in developmental biology used to explain pattern formation.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary equations, parameters, and a specific, quantifiable objective. The conditions ($T_{i+1} < T_i$ is satisfied by $0<r<1$; $c(x)$ is monotonic, matching the monotonic thresholds) are internally consistent. The existence of a unique, minimal $s$ is demonstrable. The parameters are physically plausible for the scale of a vertebrate limb bud.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, mathematical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Boundary Positions**\nThe boundary position $x_i$ is defined by the condition $c(x_i) = T_i$. Substituting the given expressions for the concentration profile and the thresholds:\n$$C_0 \\exp(-x_i/\\lambda) = T_0 r^{i-1}$$\nTo solve for $x_i$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\exp(-x_i/\\lambda)\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{C_0} r^{i-1}\\right)$$\n$$-\\frac{x_i}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{C_0}\\right) + \\ln(r^{i-1})$$\n$$-\\frac{x_i}{\\lambda} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{C_0}\\right) + (i-1)\\ln(r)$$\nMultiplying by $-\\lambda$ yields the general expression for the boundary positions:\n$$x_i = -\\lambda \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{C_0}\\right) + (i-1)\\ln(r) \\right]$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$x_i = \\lambda \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T_0}\\right) - (i-1)\\ln(r) \\right] = \\lambda \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{T_0}\\right) + (i-1)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\right]$$\n\n**Condition for Threshold Realization and Initial State**\nA boundary $x_i$ is realized within the domain $[0,L]$ if two conditions are met:\n$1.$ The threshold concentration is not above the source concentration, i.e., $T_i \\le C_0$. This ensures that $x_i \\ge 0$.\n$2.$ The boundary position falls within the physical length of the tissue, i.e., $x_i \\le L$.\n\nWe first determine the initial number of realized boundaries using the given parameters: $C_0 = 12$, $T_0 = 6$, $r = 0.5$, $\\lambda = 0.25$, and $L = 1.0$.\n\nFirst, check the condition $T_i \\le C_0$. The highest threshold is $T_1 = T_0 = 6$. Since $C_0=12$, $T_1 < C_0$, and all subsequent thresholds $T_i$ (for $i>1$) are smaller, so this condition is met for all $i=1,\\ldots,6$. This guarantees $x_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$.\n\nNext, we find the number of boundaries satisfying $x_i \\le L$. Let's substitute the specific parameters into the expression for $x_i$:\n$$x_i = 0.25 \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{6}\\right) + (i-1)\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.5}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$x_i = 0.25 \\left[ \\ln(2) + (i-1)\\ln(2) \\right] = 0.25 \\ln(2) (1+i-1) = 0.25 \\cdot i \\cdot \\ln(2)$$\nThe condition $x_i \\le L$ becomes:\n$$0.25 \\cdot i \\cdot \\ln(2) \\le 1.0$$\n$$i \\le \\frac{1.0}{0.25 \\ln(2)} = \\frac{4}{\\ln(2)}$$\nUsing the approximation $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$, we find:\n$$i \\le \\frac{4}{0.6931} \\approx 5.77$$\nSince $i$ must be an integer, the maximum value of $i$ for which the boundary is realized is $\\lfloor 5.77 \\rfloor = 5$. Thus, initially there are $5$ realized boundaries, corresponding to $i=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$. The boundary $x_6$ is not realized as it lies outside the domain: $x_6 = 0.25 \\cdot 6 \\cdot \\ln(2) = 1.5 \\ln(2) \\approx 1.0397 > 1.0 = L$.\n\n**Determining the Minimal Shift Factor $s$**\nThe decoder shift modifies the thresholds to $T'_i = s \\cdot T_i$. The new boundary positions, $x'_i$, are given by:\n$$C_0 \\exp(-x'_i/\\lambda) = T'_i = s T_i$$\nSolving for $x'_i$ similarly to before:\n$$x'_i = -\\lambda \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{s T_i}{C_0}\\right) \\right] = -\\lambda \\left[ \\ln(s) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_i}{C_0}\\right) \\right]$$\nRecognizing that $-\\lambda \\ln(T_i/C_0) = x_i$, we get the simple relation:\n$$x'_i = x_i - \\lambda \\ln(s)$$\nThe goal is to increase the number of realized boundaries by one, from $5$ to $6$. This requires bringing the 6th boundary, which is currently outside the domain ($x_6 > L$), into the domain. To do this, we need to make $x'_6 \\le L$.\n$$x_6 - \\lambda \\ln(s) \\le L$$\nRearranging the inequality to solve for the condition on $s$:\n$$\\lambda \\ln(s) \\ge x_6 - L$$\n$$\\ln(s) \\ge \\frac{x_6 - L}{\\lambda}$$\n$$s \\ge \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_6 - L}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis shows that we need $s>1$ (since $x_6 > L$), which shifts all boundaries towards the source (smaller $x$). The minimal value of $s$ that achieves this corresponds to the equality, where the new 6th boundary is positioned exactly at the anterior edge of the domain, $x'_6 = L$.\n$$s_{min} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{x_6 - L}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe must also confirm that this shift does not cause the loss of any boundaries at the source ($x=0$). A boundary $x'_i$ is lost if $x'_i<0$, which occurs if $T'_i > C_0$. The most restrictive case is for $i=1$:\n$s T_1 \\le C_0 \\implies s T_0 \\le C_0 \\implies s \\le \\frac{C_0}{T_0} = \\frac{12}{6}=2$.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $s_{min}$:\n$$s_{min} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1.5 \\ln(2) - 1.0}{0.25}\\right)$$\n$$s_{min} = \\exp(4 \\cdot (1.5 \\ln(2) - 1.0)) = \\exp(6 \\ln(2) - 4)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$s_{min} = \\exp(\\ln(2^6)) \\cdot \\exp(-4) = 64 \\exp(-4)$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$s_{min} \\approx 64 \\times 0.0183156 \\approx 1.17219897$$\nThis value satisfies the condition $s_{min} \\le 2$, so no boundaries are lost.\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.172$.",
