It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe goal is to compute two values: the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) and the total number of cases prevented in the given cohort.\n\nLet $P_0$ be the baseline risk (prevalence) and $P_1$ be the post-intervention risk. We are given $P_0 = \\frac{1}{1000}$.\n\nThe Relative Risk Reduction ($RRR$) is defined as the proportional reduction in risk from the baseline.\n$$RRR = \\frac{P_0 - P_1}{P_0}$$\nWe are given $RRR = 0.5$.\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is defined as the simple difference in risk.\n$$ARR = P_0 - P_1$$\nBy rearranging the definition of $RRR$, we can express the $ARR$ in terms of $P_0$ and $RRR$.\n$$P_0 - P_1 = P_0 \\times RRR$$\nThus,\n$$ARR = P_0 \\times RRR$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ARR = \\frac{1}{1000} \\times 0.5 = \\frac{1}{1000} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2000}$$\nSo, the absolute risk reduction is $1$ in $2000$.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is defined as the reciprocal of the $ARR$.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{1/2000} = 2000$$\nThis result is an exact integer. This means that, on average, $2000$ pregnancies must be supplemented with folic acid according to the specified regimen to prevent one case of NTD.\n\nNext, we compute the expected number of NTD cases prevented in a cohort of $N = 1,000,000$ pregnancies. The number of prevented cases, let's call it $N_{\\text{prevented}}$, is the total size of the cohort multiplied by the per-pregnancy reduction in risk, which is the $ARR$.\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = N \\times ARR$$\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = 1,000,000 \\times \\frac{1}{2000}$$\n$$N_{\\text{prevented}} = \\frac{1,000,000}{2000} = \\frac{1000}{2} = 500$$\nTherefore, in a cohort of $1,000,000$ pregnancies, the intervention is expected to prevent $500$ cases of NTD.\n\nThe two required values are the $NNT$ and the number of prevented cases, which are $2000$ and $500$, respectively.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we derive the HWE genotype frequencies. Let the allele frequency of the $677\\text{T}$ allele be $p$ and that of the $677\\text{C}$ allele be $q$. Given that the population is in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three genotypes ($677\\text{CC}$, $677\\text{CT}$, $677\\text{TT}$) are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(q+p)^2$.\nThe frequency of the $677\\text{CC}$ genotype is $f(CC) = q^2$. Since $q = 1-p$, this is $f(CC) = (1-p)^2$.\nThe frequency of the $677\\text{CT}$ genotype is $f(CT) = 2pq = 2p(1-p)$.\nThe frequency of the $677\\text{TT}$ genotype is $f(TT) = p^2$.\nThe sum of these frequencies is $f(CC) + f(CT) + f(TT) = (1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) + p^2 = 1 - 2p + p^2 + 2p - 2p^2 + p^2 = 1$, as expected. The proportion of the population with $677\\text{TT}$ homozygosity is therefore $p^2$.\n\nSecond, we derive an expression for the absolute increase in the population NTD incidence. Let $r_{CC}$, $r_{CT}$, and $r_{TT}$ denote the absolute risk of NTD for individuals with genotypes $677\\text{CC}$, $677\\text{CT}$, and $677\\text{TT}$, respectively.\nWe are given the baseline risk, $r_{CC}$.\nThe problem states that heterozygotes have no excess risk, so their risk is equal to the baseline risk: $r_{CT} = r_{CC}$.\nThe relative risk for the $677\\text{TT}$ genotype is defined as $RR = \\frac{r_{TT}}{r_{CC}}$. From this, we can express the absolute risk for the $677\\text{TT}$ genotype as $r_{TT} = RR \\cdot r_{CC}$.\n\nThe overall population incidence of NTD, denoted as $I_{pop}$, is the weighted average of the genotype-specific risks, with the weights being the genotype frequencies:\n$$I_{pop} = f(CC) \\cdot r_{CC} + f(CT) \\cdot r_{CT} + f(TT) \\cdot r_{TT}$$\nSubstituting the HWE frequencies and the risk expressions:\n$$I_{pop} = (1-p)^2 r_{CC} + 2p(1-p) r_{CC} + p^2 (RR \\cdot r_{CC})$$\nWe can factor out $r_{CC}$:\n$$I_{pop} = r_{CC} \\left[ (1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) + p^2 \\cdot RR \\right]$$\nNow, consider the counterfactual scenario where the $677\\text{TT}$ genotype carries no excess risk, meaning its relative risk would be $RR=1$. In this case, $r_{TT}$ would be equal to $r_{CC}$, and thus all genotypes would have the same risk $r_{CC}$. The population incidence in this counterfactual case, $I_{counterfactual}$, would be:\n$$I_{counterfactual} = ( (1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) + p^2 ) \\cdot r_{CC} = (1) \\cdot r_{CC} = r_{CC}$$\nThe absolute increase in population incidence attributable to the excess risk in the $677\\text{TT}$ genotype is the difference $\\Delta I = I_{pop} - I_{counterfactual}$.\n$$\\Delta I = \\left( r_{CC} \\left[ (1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) + p^2 \\cdot RR \\right] \\right) - r_{CC}$$\nUsing the identity $(1-p)^2 + 2p(1-p) = 1 - p^2$:\n$$\\Delta I = r_{CC} \\left[ (1 - p^2) + p^2 \\cdot RR \\right] - r_{CC}$$\n$$\\Delta I = r_{CC} - p^2 r_{CC} + p^2 \\cdot RR \\cdot r_{CC} - r_{CC}$$\nThe $r_{CC}$ terms cancel out:\n$$\\Delta I = p^2 \\cdot RR \\cdot r_{CC} - p^2 r_{CC}$$\nFactoring out the common terms $p^2$ and $r_{CC}$ yields the final expression:\n$$\\Delta I = p^2 r_{CC} (RR - 1)$$\nThis expression represents the population-attributable risk increase, which is the product of the prevalence of the high-risk genotype ($p^2$) and the excess absolute risk in that genotype ($r_{CC}(RR-1)$).\n\nThird, we evaluate this absolute increase for the given numerical values: $p = 0.30$, $RR = 1.4$, and $r_{CC} = 0.001$.\n$$\\Delta I = (0.30)^2 \\cdot (0.001) \\cdot (1.4 - 1)$$\n$$\\Delta I = (0.09) \\cdot (0.001) \\cdot (0.4)$$\n$$\\Delta I = 0.09 \\cdot 0.0004$$\n$$\\Delta I = 0.000036$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $0.000036$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.00003600$. In standard scientific notation, this is $3.600 \\times 10^{-5}$.",

The reaction velocity, $v$, as a function of the concentration of a substrate or cofactor, $[S]$, is given by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nHere, the velocity is dependent on the concentration of the FAD cofactor, $[S]$.\n\nFirst, we write the expression for the reaction velocity of the wild-type (WT) enzyme, $v^{\\mathrm{WT}}$, using its specific parameters, $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} [S]}{K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}} + [S]}$$\nThe problem states that the velocity should be evaluated at a physiological FAD concentration of $[S] = K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$. Substituting this condition into the equation for $v^{\\mathrm{WT}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} (K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}})}{K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}} + K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}} K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}{2 K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}}$$\nThe term $K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$ cancels, yielding:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{WT}}$$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of $K_m$ as the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nNext, we write the expression for the reaction velocity of the variant (VAR) enzyme, $v^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$, using its parameters, $V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$ and $K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}}$:\n$$v^{\\mathrm{VAR}} = \\frac{V_{\\max}^{\\mathrm{VAR}} [S]}{K_m^{\\mathrm{VAR}} + [S]}$$\nWe evaluate this velocity at the same physiological FAD concentration, $[S] = K_m^{\\mathrm{WT}}$.
