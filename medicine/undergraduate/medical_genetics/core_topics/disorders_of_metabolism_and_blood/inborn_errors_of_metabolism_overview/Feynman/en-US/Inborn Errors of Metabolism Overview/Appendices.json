This exercise applies the fundamental Hardy-Weinberg principle, a cornerstone of population genetics, to a common question in genetic counseling and public health.

Express the final answer as a row matrix containing, in order, the values for $q$ and $2pq$. Use decimal or scientific notation as appropriate, and do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario in population genetics based on the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) principle, providing sufficient and consistent information to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of genotype frequencies from allele frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and then a calculation of specific frequencies based on provided data.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions. In a diploid population, for a gene with two alleles at a single locus, let the dominant (wild-type) allele be denoted by $A$ and the recessive (mutant) allele be denoted by $a$. Let the frequency of allele $A$ in the gene pool be $p$ and the frequency of allele $a$ be $q$. Since these are the only two alleles at this locus, their frequencies must sum to unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle states that if a population is large, undergoes random mating, and is not affected by evolutionary forces such as mutation, gene flow (migration), natural selection, or genetic drift, then the allele and genotype frequencies will remain constant from generation to generation.\n\nUnder these conditions, the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes ($AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$) in the next generation are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n$$(p + q)^2 = p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1$$\nThis equation provides the relationship between the allele frequencies ($p$ and $q$) and the expected genotype frequencies:\n-   The frequency of the homozygous dominant genotype ($AA$) is $p^2$. Individuals with this genotype are phenotypically unaffected.\n-   The frequency of the heterozygous genotype ($Aa$) is $2pq$. Since the disorder is autosomal recessive, these individuals are phenotypically unaffected carriers of the mutant allele. This is the **heterozygous carrier frequency**.\n-   The frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype ($aa$) is $q^2$. These individuals are affected by the autosomal recessive disorder. This is the **expected affected genotype frequency**.\n\nThis completes the first part of the problem, which asks for the derivation of the expected genotype frequencies and their relationship to the underlying allele frequencies.\n\nNext, we use the specific data provided in the problem. The reported incidence of the autosomal recessive disorder is $1/10{,}000$. This incidence corresponds to the frequency of affected individuals in the population, which is the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, $q^2$.\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{10{,}000} = 0.0001 = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nFrom this, we can directly infer the frequency of the mutant allele, $q$, by taking the square root of the affected genotype frequency:\n$$q = \\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.01$$\nThis is the mutant allele frequency.\n\nThe frequency of the wild-type allele, $p$, can then be calculated exactly:\n$$p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$$\n\nThe problem then asks to infer the carrier frequency, $2pq$, using the approximation that the wild-type allele frequency $p \\approx 1$ for rare autosomal recessive conditions. This approximation is justified because $q=0.01$ is small, making $p=0.99$ very close to $1$.\n\nThe exact carrier frequency is $2pq$. Applying the specified approximation $p \\approx 1$:\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} = 2pq \\approx 2(1)q = 2q $$\nSubstituting the calculated value of $q$:\n$$ \\text{Carrier Frequency} \\approx 2(0.01) = 0.02 $$\n\nFor completeness, we can assess the error introduced by this approximation. The exact carrier frequency is $2pq = 2(0.99)(0.01) = 0.0198$. The approximation yields $0.02$. The relative error is $|0.02 - 0.0198| / 0.0198 \\approx 0.0101$, or about $1\\%$. The approximation is therefore quite accurate for this rare allele.\n\nFollowing the problem's instructions, we report the values for $q$ and the approximated carrier frequency. Both must be rounded to four significant figures.\n-   Mutant allele frequency, $q = 0.01$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.01000$.\n-   Approximated carrier frequency, $2pq \\approx 0.02$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.02000$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix containing these two values in order.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a realistic clinical scenario involving a suspected inborn error of metabolism and provides all necessary laboratory data to perform the requested calculations of the anion gap and osmolar gap. The underlying principles for these calculations are fundamental concepts in clinical chemistry and physiology. The data are internally consistent for a diagnosis of organic acidemia with metabolic acidosis. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution is provided below.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two key clinical metrics, the anion gap and the osmolar gap, and subsequent interpretation based on the provided laboratory data for an infant with a suspected organic acidemia.\n\nFirst, we calculate the anion gap ($AG$). The anion gap is an estimate of the unmeasured anions in the plasma, calculated as the difference between the measured major cation ($\\text{Na}^+$) and the measured major anions ($\\text{Cl}^-$ and $\\text{HCO}_3^-$). The problem specifies using the convention that excludes potassium ($\\text{K}^+$).\n\nThe formula for the anion gap is:\n$$\nAG = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-])\n$$\n\nThe given serum concentrations are:\n- Serum sodium, $[\\text{Na}^+]$ = $140$ mEq/L\n- Serum chloride, $[\\text{Cl}^-]$ = $100$ mEq/L\n- Serum bicarbonate, $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ = $10$ mEq/L\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\nAG = 140 \\, \\text{mEq/L} - (100 \\, \\text{mEq/L} + 10 \\, \\text{mEq/L})\n$$\n$$\nAG = 140 \\, \\text{mEq/L} - 110 \\, \\text{mEq/L} = 30 \\, \\text{mEq/L}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the anion gap is $30.0$ mEq/L.\n\nSecond, we calculate the osmolar gap ($OG$). The osmolar gap is the difference between the measured serum osmolality ($Osm_{meas}$) and the calculated serum osmolality ($Osm_{calc}$).\n\nThe formula for calculated osmolality is based on the major osmotically active solutes in the serum: sodium, glucose, and urea.\n$$\nOsm_{calc} = 2 \\times [\\text{Na}^+] + \\frac{[\\text{Glucose}]}{18} + \\frac{[\\text{BUN}]}{2.8}\n$$\nIn this formula, the concentration of sodium is given in mEq/L, which is equivalent to mmol/L. The factor of $2$ accounts for the accompanying anions (primarily chloride and bicarbonate). The concentrations of glucose and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) are given in mg/dL and must be converted to mmol/L to represent their molar contribution to osmolality. The conversion factor for glucose is its molecular weight ($\\approx 180.16$ g/mol), which leads to a division by approximately $18$. The factor for BUN is based on the molecular weight of the two nitrogen atoms in urea ($2 \\times 14.007$ g/mol), leading to a division by approximately $2.8$. Note that the calculated value is technically an osmolarity (mOsm/L), but for serum, this is a clinically accepted approximation for osmolality (mOsm/kg).\n\nThe given values are:\n- Measured serum osmolality, $Osm_{meas}$ = $310$ mOsm/kg\n- Serum sodium, $[\\text{Na}^+]$ = $140$ mEq/L\n- Serum glucose, $[\\text{Glucose}]$ = $90$ mg/dL\n- Blood Urea Nitrogen, $[\\text{BUN}]$ = $14$ mg/dL\n\nSubstituting these values to find the calculated osmolality:\n$$\nOsm_{calc} = 2 \\times 140 + \\frac{90}{18} + \\frac{14}{2.8}\n$$\n$$\nOsm_{calc} = 280 + 5 + 5 = 290 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg}\n$$\n\nNow, the osmolar gap is calculated:\n$$\nOG = Osm_{meas} - Osm_{calc}\n$$\n$$\nOG = 310 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} - 290 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} = 20 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the osmolar gap is $20.0$ mOsm/kg.\n\nFinally, we provide a brief interpretation of these findings.\nA normal anion gap is typically in the range of $8-12$ mEq/L. The calculated anion gap of $30.0$ mEq/L is significantly elevated, indicating a high anion gap metabolic acidosis (HAGMA). This condition arises from the accumulation of endogenous or exogenous acids. The protons ($H^+$) from these acids are buffered by bicarbonate ($\\text{HCO}_3^-$), lowering its concentration and thereby increasing the anion gap, as the acid's conjugate base becomes an \"unmeasured anion\". The provided data show elevated levels of several organic acids: lactate ($6$ mmol/L), beta-hydroxybutyrate ($4$ mmol/L), and methylmalonate ($8$ mmol/L). At physiological pH, these acids exist as anions. The sum of these specific unmeasured anions is $6 + 4 + 8 = 18$ mEq/L, which accounts for the majority of the elevation in the anion gap above its normal baseline.\n\nA normal osmolar gap is typically less than $10-15$ mOsm/kg. The calculated osmolar gap of $20.0$ mOsm/kg is also elevated. An elevated osmolar gap signifies the presence of a significant concentration of unmeasured, osmotically active solutes. In cases of intoxication, these are typically toxic alcohols. However, in an organic acidemia, the \"intoxication-like pathophysiology\" is caused by the accumulation of endogenous small organic molecules. The very organic acids causing the anion gap are also osmotically active solutes. Their contribution to osmolality is approximately equal to their molar concentration. The total concentration of the measured abnormal metabolites is $6 \\, \\text{mmol/L} + 4 \\, \\text{mmol/L} + 8 \\, \\text{mmol/L} = 18 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$, which corresponds to an osmotic contribution of approximately $18$ mOsm/kg. This value very closely accounts for the calculated osmolar gap of $20.0$ mOsm/kg.\n\nIn summary, the high anion gap is caused by the anionic forms of accumulated organic acids, while the high osmolar gap is caused by the osmotic activity of these same small molecules. The concordance between the sum of measured organic acids ($18$ mOsm/kg) and the observed osmolar gap ($20.0$ mOsm/kg) strongly supports the diagnosis of an organic acidemia (specifically, methylmalonic acidemia, given the markedly elevated methylmalonate) as the cause of this clinical presentation, rather than an exogenous intoxication.",
