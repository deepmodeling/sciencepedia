            "problem": "A hepatocyte receives a single input of one mole of galactose and processes it via the Leloir pathway into glycolysis. The Leloir pathway consists of phosphorylation of galactose by galactokinase, uridylyl transfer to form glucose-$1$-phosphate via galactose-$1$-phosphate uridylyltransferase, epimerization of uridine diphosphate (UDP) galactose to UDP glucose by UDP-galactose $4$-epimerase, and conversion of glucose-$1$-phosphate to glucose-$6$-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase, which then enters glycolysis. Assume the UDP sugar transformations operate as a catalytic cycle with no net consumption of uridine triphosphate (UTP), and that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ($NAD^{+}$) used by UDP-galactose $4$-epimerase is an enzyme-bound cofactor with no net production or consumption of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). Consider only cytosolic glycolysis to pyruvate under conditions where NADH is produced at the glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate dehydrogenase step and is not reoxidized within glycolysis; ignore oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial shuttles. For glucose entering glycolysis directly, account for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) investments and substrate-level ATP generation in the canonical pathway.\n\nStarting from first principles of mass balance and nucleotide energetics at the level of individual enzymatic steps (phosphorylation investments and substrate-level phosphorylations), derive the net ATP and NADH yield per mole of galactose entering glycolysis via the Leloir pathway, explicitly accounting for the ATP consumed by galactokinase, and compare it to the net ATP and NADH yield per mole of glucose entering glycolysis.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of the net adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) yields from the complete cytosolic glycolysis of one mole of galactose versus one mole of glucose. The final products of glycolysis are assumed to be two moles of pyruvate per mole of hexose sugar. The analysis will proceed by stoichiometric accounting of high-energy phosphate bonds and redox equivalents at each relevant enzymatic step.\n\nFirst, let us analyze the canonical glycolytic pathway for one mole of glucose. The pathway can be divided into an investment phase and a payoff phase.\n\n**Metabolism of Glucose:**\n\n1.  **Investment Phase:** This phase consumes ATP to activate the glucose molecule.\n    *   **Hexokinase/Glucokinase:** The first step is the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose-$6$-phosphate. This reaction is catalyzed by hexokinase (or glucokinase in hepatocytes) and consumes one molecule of ATP.\n        $$ \\text{Glucose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Glucose-}6\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{ADP} $$\n        This step represents a cost of $1$ mole of ATP per mole of glucose.\n    *   **Phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1):** After isomerization to fructose-$6$-phosphate, a second phosphorylation occurs, producing fructose-$1$,$6$-bisphosphate. This irreversible step is a key regulatory point and consumes a second molecule of ATP.\n        $$ \\text{Fructose-}6\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-}1,6\\text{-bisphosphate} + \\text{ADP} $$\n        This step represents an additional cost of $1$ mole of ATP per mole of glucose.\n    *   The total investment for one mole of glucose is $1 + 1 = 2$ moles of ATP.\n\n2.  **Payoff Phase:** In this phase, the $6$-carbon fructose-$1$,$6$-bisphosphate is cleaved into two $3$-carbon molecules, which are both converted to pyruvate. The following yields are therefore multiplied by a factor of $2$.\n    *   **Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Dehydrogenase (GAPDH):** This step oxidizes and phosphorylates two molecules of glyceraldehyde-$3$-phosphate to two molecules of $1$,$3$-bisphosphoglycerate. This is the sole oxidative step in glycolysis, producing two molecules of NADH.\n        $$ 2 \\times (\\text{Glyceraldehyde-}3\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{NAD}^+ + \\text{P}_i \\rightarrow 1,3\\text{-Bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{NADH} + \\text{H}^+) $$\n        This step produces a total of $2$ moles of NADH per mole of glucose. The problem specifies that this NADH is not reoxidized.\n    *   **Phosphoglycerate Kinase (PGK):** The high-energy acyl-phosphate bond of $1$,$3$-bisphosphoglycerate is used to generate ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation.\n        $$ 2 \\times (1,3\\text{-Bisphosphoglycerate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow 3\\text{-Phosphoglycerate} + \\text{ATP}) $$\n        This step produces a total of $2$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose.\n    *   **Pyruvate Kinase (PK):** The final step of glycolysis involves the transfer of a phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate to ADP, another substrate-level phosphorylation.\n        $$ 2 \\times (\\text{Phosphoenolpyruvate} + \\text{ADP} \\rightarrow \\text{Pyruvate} + \\text{ATP}) $$\n        This step produces another $2$ moles of ATP per mole of glucose.\n    *   The total yield in the payoff phase is $2 + 2 = 4$ moles of ATP and $2$ moles of NADH.\n\n3.  **Net Yield for Glucose ($\\text{ATP}_{\\text{glc}}$, $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{glc}}$):**\n    *   Net ATP = (ATP produced) - (ATP consumed) = $4 - 2 = 2$ moles.\n    *   Net NADH = (NADH produced) - (NADH consumed) = $2 - 0 = 2$ moles.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{ATP}_{\\text{glc}} = 2$ and $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{glc}} = 2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the metabolism of one mole of galactose via the Leloir pathway, followed by glycolysis.\n\n**Metabolism of Galactose:**\n\n1.  **Leloir Pathway:** This pathway converts galactose into glucose-$6$-phosphate.\n    *   **Galactokinase (GALK):** Galactose is first phosphorylated to galactose-$1$-phosphate. This step consumes one molecule of ATP.\n        $$ \\text{Galactose} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Galactose-}1\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{ADP} $$\n        This step represents a cost of $1$ mole of ATP per mole of galactose.\n    *   **Galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT):** Galactose-$1$-phosphate is converted to glucose-$1$-phosphate.\n        $$ \\text{Galactose-}1\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{UDP-glucose} \\rightarrow \\text{UDP-galactose} + \\text{Glucose-}1\\text{-phosphate} $$\n    *   **UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GALE):** UDP-galactose is epimerized back to UDP-glucose, regenerating the substrate for the GALT reaction.\n        $$ \\text{UDP-galactose} \\leftrightarrow \\text{UDP-glucose} $$\n        The problem states that the $NAD^+$ cofactor for this enzyme is enzyme-bound and its redox state has no net change, so there is no net production or consumption of NADH from this step.\n    *   The problem also states that the UDP sugar transformations operate as a catalytic cycle with no net consumption of UTP. This is a simplifying assumption that renders the GALT/GALE cycle energetically neutral with respect to high-energy phosphates.\n    *   **Phosphoglucomutase (PGM):** Glucose-$1$-phosphate is isomerized to glucose-$6$-phosphate, which can then enter the main glycolytic pathway.\n        $$ \\text{Glucose-}1\\text{-phosphate} \\leftrightarrow \\text{Glucose-}6\\text{-phosphate} $$\n        This reaction is freely reversible and does not involve ATP or NADH.\n    *   The net cost of the Leloir pathway to convert $1$ mole of galactose to $1$ mole of glucose-$6$-phosphate is therefore $1$ mole of ATP.\n\n2.  **Glycolysis from Glucose-6-phosphate:**\n    *   The molecule enters glycolysis at the glucose-$6$-phosphate stage, thus bypassing the first ATP investment step (hexokinase), which is specific to glucose.\n    *   **Investment Phase:** The only investment step remaining is the one catalyzed by PFK-1.\n        $$ \\text{Fructose-}6\\text{-phosphate} + \\text{ATP} \\rightarrow \\text{Fructose-}1,6\\text{-bisphosphate} + \\text{ADP} $$\n        This consumes $1$ mole of ATP.\n    *   **Payoff Phase:** The payoff phase is identical to that for glucose, as the pathway from fructose-$1$,$6$-bisphosphate to pyruvate is the same. This phase yields $4$ moles of ATP and $2$ moles of NADH.\n\n3.  **Net Yield for Galactose ($\\text{ATP}_{\\text{gal}}$, $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{gal}}$):**\n    *   Total ATP consumed = ($1$ ATP from GALK) + ($1$ ATP from PFK-1) = $2$ moles.\n    *   Total ATP produced = $4$ moles (from PGK and PK).\n    *   Net ATP = $4 - 2 = 2$ moles.\n    *   Total NADH produced = $2$ moles (from GAPDH). There is no NADH consumption.\n    *   Net NADH = $2$ moles.\n    *   Therefore, $\\text{ATP}_{\\text{gal}} = 2$ and $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{gal}} = 2$.\n\nIn summary, under the specified conditions, the net energetic yield from the conversion of one mole of either glucose or galactose to two moles of pyruvate is identical. For both sugars, the net yield is $2$ moles of ATP and $2$ moles of NADH.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}\\text{ATP}_{\\text{gal}} & \\text{NADH}_{\\text{gal}} & \\text{ATP}_{\\text{glc}} & \\text{NADH}_{\\text{glc}}\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe values are $\\text{ATP}_{\\text{gal}}=2$, $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{gal}}=2$, $\\text{ATP}_{\\text{glc}}=2$, and $\\text{NADH}_{\\text{glc}}=2$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}2 & 2 & 2 & 2\\end{pmatrix}$.",

In hepatocytes, galactokinase (GALK) converts galactose to galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), while GALT consumes Gal-1-P. Assume:\n- The measured flux through galactokinase is $v_{\\text{GALK}} = 1.5$ mmol/kg/day.\n- The residual flux through galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase is $v_{\\text{GALT}} = 0.1$ mmol/kg/day.\n- No other significant pathways for Gal-1-P production or disposal are operative.\n- The effective hepatic volume of distribution for Gal-1-P is $1$ L per kg body weight, so that a $1$ kg compartment corresponds to $1$ L.\n\nUsing conservation of mass for the Gal-1-P pool, compute the net daily increase in the hepatic concentration of galactose-1-phosphate, $[\\text{Gal-1-P}]$, under these conditions. Express your answer in mmol/L/day. No rounding is required; report the numeric value only.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the net daily increase in the hepatic concentration of galactose-1-phosphate ($[\\text{Gal-1-P}]$). This is a mass balance problem, and its solution is governed by the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}(t)$ be the amount of galactose-1-phosphate in the hepatic compartment at time $t$. The rate of change of this amount, $\\frac{dN_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of its production and the rate of its consumption.\n\nThe problem states that galactose-1-phosphate is produced by the action of galactokinase (GALK) and consumed by the action of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (GALT). The fluxes are given on a per kilogram body weight basis. Let us consider a reference compartment of $1$ kg of body weight. The rate of production is the flux through GALK, $v_{\\text{GALK}}$, and the rate of consumption is the flux through GALT, $v_{\\text{GALT}}$. The problem specifies that no other significant pathways for Gal-1-P production or disposal are operative.\n\nTherefore, the net rate of accumulation of the amount of Gal-1-P per kilogram of body weight is:\n$$ \\frac{d(N_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}/\\text{kg})}{dt} = v_{\\text{GALK}} - v_{\\text{GALT}} $$\n\nWe are given the following values for the fluxes:\n- Flux through galactokinase, $v_{\\text{GALK}} = 1.5$ mmol/kg/day.\n- Residual flux through galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, $v_{\\text{GALT}} = 0.1$ mmol/kg/day.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation gives the net rate of change of the amount of Gal-1-P per kilogram:\n$$ \\frac{d(N_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}/\\text{kg})}{dt} = 1.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} - 0.1 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 1.4 \\, \\frac{\\text{mmol}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the rate of change of the *concentration* of Gal-1-P, which is denoted as $[\\text{Gal-1-P}]$.

Assuming the volume of distribution $V_{\\text{dist}}$ is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\text{Gal-1-P}]}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{N_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}}{V_{\\text{dist}}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{V_{\\text{dist}}} \\frac{dN_{\\text{Gal-1-P}}}{dt} $$\n\nThis equation relates the rate of change of concentration to the rate of change of amount. The problem provides the effective hepatic volume of distribution for Gal-1-P as $1$ L per kg body weight.
