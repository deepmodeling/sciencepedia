It contains no logical contradictions or missing information. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the recurrence risk for an autosomal recessive disorder given that both parents are heterozygous carriers. The principles of Mendelian genetics govern the transmission of alleles from parents to offspring.\n\nThe parental genotypes are given as $A a$, where $A$ is the normal allele and $a$ is the pathogenic allele. Since the disorder is recessive, an individual must have the genotype $aa$ to be affected. The genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$ result in an unaffected phenotype, though $Aa$ individuals are carriers.\n\nAccording to Mendel's first law (the Law of Segregation), during gamete formation (meiosis), the two alleles for a heritable character segregate from each other so that each gamete ends up with only one allele. For a heterozygous parent with genotype $Aa$, there is an equal probability of passing on either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele.\nTherefore, for each parent, the probability of producing a gamete with the $A$ allele is $P(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$, and the probability of producing a gamete with the $a$ allele is $P(a) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe genotype of a child is determined by the random fusion of one gamete from the father and one from the mother. The probability of each offspring genotype can be calculated by applying the product rule of probability, as the choice of allele from each parent is an independent event.\n\nWe can construct a Punnett square to visualize the possible combinations of alleles in the offspring:\n\n|             | Gamete from Parent 2 ($A$) | Gamete from Parent 2 ($a$) |\n|-------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| Gamete from Parent 1 ($A$) | $AA$                       | $Aa$                       |\n| Gamete from Parent 1 ($a$) | $aA$ (i.e., $Aa$)          | $aa$                       |\n\nThe probabilities for each genotype are calculated as follows:\n1.  Probability of genotype $AA$: This requires inheriting an $A$ allele from Parent 1 (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) and an $A$ allele from Parent 2 (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n    $$P(AA) = P(A_{\\text{parent 1}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{parent 2}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n2.  Probability of genotype $Aa$: This can occur in two ways. Inheriting $A$ from Parent 1 and $a$ from Parent 2, or inheriting $a$ from Parent 1 and $A$ from Parent 2.\n    $$P(Aa) = [P(A_{\\text{parent 1}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{parent 2}})] + [P(a_{\\text{parent 1}}) \\times P(A_{\\text{parent 2}})] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n3.  Probability of genotype $aa$: This requires inheriting an $a$ allele from Parent 1 (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$) and an $a$ allele from Parent 2 (probability $\\frac{1}{2}$).\n    $$P(aa) = P(a_{\\text{parent 1}}) \\times P(a_{\\text{parent 2}}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe sum of these probabilities must be $1$: $P(AA) + P(Aa) + P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected distribution of offspring genotypes. Based on the calculations above, the distribution of genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$ is expected to be in the ratio $1:2:1$, with corresponding probabilities of $\\frac{1}{4}$, $\\frac{1}{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{4}$, respectively.\n\nThe problem also asks for the per-child recurrence risk that a future child will be affected with the autosomal recessive UCD. An individual is affected only if they have the genotype $aa$. The problem specifies complete penetrance, meaning every individual with the $aa$ genotype will exhibit the disease phenotype.\nTherefore, the recurrence risk is equal to the probability of an offspring having the $aa$ genotype.\n\nRecurrence risk $= P(\\text{affected child}) = P(\\text{genotype } aa)$.\n\nFrom our calculation, this probability is:\n$$P(aa) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThis probability applies to each child independently of the outcomes of previous children, due to the assumption of random Mendelian segregation and independent assortment across meioses. The fraction $\\frac{1}{4}$ is in its simplest form.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem describes a two-allele system for an autosomal gene in a population under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. Let $p$ be the frequency of the normal allele and $q$ be the frequency of the pathogenic (recessive) allele. The sum of the allele frequencies must be unity:\n$$p + q = 1$$\n\nUnder Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the three possible genotypes are given by the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^2$:\n-   Frequency of homozygous dominant (unaffected non-carriers): $p^2$\n-   Frequency of heterozygous (unaffected carriers): $2pq$\n-   Frequency of homozygous recessive (affected individuals): $q^2$\n\nThe problem states that the incidence of the UCD is equal to the homozygous recessive genotype frequency, which is given as:\n$$q^2 = \\frac{1}{50{,}000}$$\n\nOur goal is to find the carrier frequency, which is given by the term $2pq$. First, we can write an exact expression for the carrier frequency by substituting for $p$. From $p+q=1$, we have $p=1-q$. Therefore, the exact carrier frequency is:\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} = 2pq = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for an approximation appropriate for rare alleles. A rare allele is one for which the frequency $q$ is very small, i.e., $q \\ll 1$. We can verify this condition from the given data:\n$$q = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{50{,}000}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{-5}} \\approx 0.00447$$\nSince $q \\approx 0.00447 \\ll 1$, the allele is indeed rare.\n\nFor a rare allele, the frequency of the normal allele, $p = 1 - q$, is very close to $1$. Formally, $p = 1 - q \\approx 1$. This is the rare-allele approximation. Substituting this approximation into the expression for the carrier frequency, $2pq$, we get:\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 2(1)q = 2q$$\nThis expression, $2q$, is the standard rare-allele approximation for the carrier frequency. This approximation is justified because the term we are neglecting, $2q^2$, is the incidence of the disease, which is very small compared to $2q$. Specifically, $2q^2 = 2(\\frac{1}{50{,}000}) = \\frac{1}{25{,}000} = 0.00004$, whereas $2q \\approx 0.00894$. The relative error of the approximation is $q$, which is less than $0.5\\%$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this approximated carrier frequency.\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 2q = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{50{,}000}}$$\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 2 \\times \\sqrt{0.00002}$$\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 2 \\times 0.00447213595...$$\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 0.0089442719...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first significant figure is $8$, followed by $9$, $4$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $2$. Since $2 < 5$, we round down.\n$$F_{\\text{carrier}} \\approx 0.008944$$\n\nThis value represents the estimated fraction of the population that are heterozygous carriers of the pathogenic allele for this specific urea cycle disorder.",

It is the complement of the specificity, $S_p = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - S_p$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (S_e)(p) + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)$$\nNow, substituting this complete expression for $P(T^+)$ into Bayes' theorem gives the analytic expression for the PPV:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the required general analytic expression for the PPV in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n$S_e = 0.90$\n$S_p = 0.995$\n$p = \\frac{1}{70{,}000}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.90) \\left(\\frac{1}{70{,}000}\\right)}{(0.90) \\left(\\frac{1}{70{,}000}\\right) + (1 - 0.995) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{70{,}000}\\right)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{\\frac{0.90}{70{,}000}}{\\frac{0.90}{70{,}000} + (0.005) \\left(\\frac{69{,}999}{70{,}000}\\right)}$$\nWe can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $70{,}000$ to simplify the expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.90}{0.90 + (0.005)(69{,}999)}$$\nNow, we calculate the value of the denominator:\n$$0.90 + (0.005)(69{,}999) = 0.90 + 349.995 = 350.895$$\nSo, the PPV is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.90}{350.895}$$\nCalculating the final value:\n$$PPV \\approx 0.00256471197...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
