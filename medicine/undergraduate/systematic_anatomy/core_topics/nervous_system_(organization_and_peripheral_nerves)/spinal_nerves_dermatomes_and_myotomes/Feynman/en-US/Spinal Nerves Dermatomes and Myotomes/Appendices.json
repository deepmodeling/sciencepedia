This first practice challenges you to apply your knowledge of the $C7$ myotome to a common clinical scenario: a cervical disc herniation. By reasoning from a known anatomical lesion to the expected pattern of muscle weakness, you will strengthen your ability to connect abstract anatomical maps to tangible patient signs. ",

Magnetic resonance imaging reveals a focal right paracentral intervertebral disc protrusion at the $C6-C7$ level that compresses the exiting $C7$ spinal nerve root. Using core definitions that a myotome is the set of muscles primarily innervated by a single spinal nerve root and that radiculopathy produces weakness proportional to the root’s contribution to each movement, predict the motor pattern most consistent with an isolated right $C7$ radiculopathy. Assume no coexisting peripheral mononeuropathies and no upper motor neuron signs, and focus on gross joint actions rather than fine muscle testing.\n\nWhich option best describes the expected pattern of weakness and relative preservation across upper limb movements?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the motor pattern consistent with an isolated $C7$ radiculopathy. This requires identifying the key movements for which the $C7$ spinal nerve provides the primary innervation, known as the $C7$ myotome.\n\n**Derivation of the $C7$ Myotome Pattern**\n\n1.  **Movements primarily controlled by $C7$**:\n    *   **Elbow Extension**: The triceps brachii muscle, the primary extensor of the elbow, is predominantly innervated by the $C7$ root (with contributions from $C6$ and $C8$). Therefore, weakness in elbow extension is a cardinal sign of $C7$ radiculopathy. The triceps reflex, a $C7$-mediated reflex, would also be expected to be diminished or absent.\n    *   **Wrist Flexion**: The wrist flexors, particularly the flexor carpi radialis, receive significant $C7$ innervation (along with $C6$). Thus, wrist flexion weakness is expected.\n    *   **Finger Extension**: The extensors of the fingers located in the posterior compartment of the forearm (e.g., extensor digitorum communis) are primarily innervated by $C7$ (and $C8$). Weakness in extending the fingers at the metacarpophalangeal joints is a key finding.\n\n2.  **Movements with minimal $C7$ contribution (relatively preserved)**:\n    *   **Shoulder Abduction**: This action is performed by the deltoid and supraspinatus muscles, which are primarily innervated by the $C5$ root (with some $C6$ contribution). Strength should be largely preserved.\n    *   **Elbow Flexion**: This action is carried out by the biceps brachii and brachialis muscles, which are primarily innervated by the $C5$ and $C6$ roots. Strength should be largely preserved.\n    *   **Intrinsic Hand Muscle Function**: The small muscles of the hand (interossei, lumbricals, thenar and hypothenar muscles) are primarily innervated by the $C8$ and $T1$ roots. Actions like finger abduction/adduction should be unaffected.\n\n**Summary of Expected Pattern for $C7$ Radiculopathy:**\n*   **Weakness**: Elbow extension, wrist flexion, finger extension.\n*   **Preserved Strength**: Shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, intrinsic hand movements.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Weak elbow extension, weak wrist flexion, and weak finger extension, with relative preservation of shoulder abduction and elbow flexion; no primary deficit of intrinsic hand abduction:** This option perfectly matches the expected clinical presentation of an isolated $C7$ radiculopathy.\n\n*   **B. Weak shoulder abduction and elbow flexion, with preserved elbow extension and wrist flexion; marked weakness of deltoid and supraspinatus:** This describes a classic $C5$ or $C5/C6$ radiculopathy, not a $C7$ radiculopathy.\n\n*   **C. Weak wrist extension and thumb abduction with preserved elbow extension and wrist flexion; brachioradialis reflex diminished while triceps strength intact:** This describes a classic $C6$ radiculopathy. The preservation of elbow extension is a key feature that points away from a $C7$ lesion.\n\n*   **D. Profound weakness of distal finger flexion and intrinsic hand abduction with intact elbow extension and wrist flexion; thenar and interosseous wasting predominates:** This describes a $C8/T1$ radiculopathy or a lower trunk brachial plexus injury. The intact elbow extension contradicts a $C7$ lesion.\n\n*   **E. Marked weakness of forearm supination and elbow flexion with normal triceps strength; shoulder abduction preserved and wrist flexion intact:** This pattern points to a $C5/C6$ radiculopathy. The normal triceps strength and intact wrist flexion are inconsistent with a $C7$ lesion.\n\nBased on this analysis, option A is the only one that accurately describes the myotomal pattern of a $C7$ radiculopathy.",

            "introduction": "Just as myotomes map motor control, dermatomes provide a blueprint for cutaneous sensation. However, localizing a lesion based on sensory symptoms requires a careful and systematic examination technique to avoid being misled by overlapping nerve territories. This exercise asks you to design a robust sensory testing strategy to differentiate between two adjacent cervical radiculopathies, forcing you to consider not just *what* to test, but *how* to test it to ensure a reliable diagnosis.

            "problem": "A patient presents with unilateral paresthesia and subjective sensory change in the hand without overt motor weakness. You are asked to differentiate cervical nerve root pathology between $C6$ and $C7$ at the bedside using only sensory testing, specifically discriminative touch for the thumb and pinprick for the middle finger, as equipment is limited and motor testing is deferred. Use the following fundamental bases: (i) a dermatome is the cutaneous territory primarily innervated by a single spinal nerve root; (ii) radiculopathy is dysfunction of a spinal nerve root that compromises all primary afferent modalities entering that root from the affected dermatome; (iii) discriminative (fine) touch and two-point discrimination are conveyed by the Dorsal Column–Medial Lemniscus (DCML) pathway; (iv) pinprick and temperature are conveyed by the Anterolateral System (ALS), also called the Spinothalamic Tract; and (v) the commonly accepted mapping places the thumb in the $C6$ dermatome and the middle finger in the $C7$ dermatome, with the little finger in the $C8$ dermatome. Design a bedside strategy that uses these principles to distinguish $C6$ from $C7$ radiculopathy and minimizes confounding by peripheral nerve lesions (for example, median or radial neuropathy) and cortical factors. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Perform bilateral, side-to-side comparison of discriminative touch over both the pulp and dorsum of the thumb ($C6$) and pinprick over both the pulp and dorsum of the middle finger ($C7$), adding a control pinprick on the little finger ($C8$). Interpret as follows: if discriminative touch loss is localized to the thumb with preserved pinprick at the middle finger and normal control at the little finger, suspect $C6$ radiculopathy; if pinprick loss is localized to the middle finger with preserved thumb discriminative touch and normal control, suspect $C7$ radiculopathy. Palmar–dorsal concordance strengthens a root-level localization and reduces the likelihood of an isolated peripheral nerve lesion.\n\nB. Test only the palmar pads of the thumb and middle finger on the symptomatic side: perform pinprick on the thumb and discriminative touch on the middle finger. If either is reduced, infer the corresponding root ($C6$ for the thumb, $C7$ for the middle finger).\n\nC. Test discriminative touch over the middle finger and pinprick over the thumb bilaterally, focusing on the pulp surfaces. If discriminative touch is reduced at the middle finger, assign $C7$; if pinprick is reduced at the thumb, assign $C6$.\n\nD. Rely on two-point discrimination across all digits of the symptomatic hand and select the root based on the single worst-performing digit, without contralateral comparison or dorsal–palmar assessment, as two-point discrimination is considered the most sensitive bedside measure of DCML integrity.",
            "solution": "To design an optimal bedside strategy, we must integrate all the given principles to maximize diagnostic accuracy and minimize confounders.\n\n1.  **Localize by Dermatome:** According to principle (v), testing the thumb targets the $C6$ root, and testing the middle finger targets the $C7$ root. The problem specifies testing discriminative touch for the thumb and pinprick for the middle finger.\n\n2.  **Control for Cortical Factors:** Sensory perception is subjective. A **bilateral, side-to-side comparison** is essential to use the asymptomatic side as the patient's own baseline, controlling for attention and non-organic factors.\n\n3.  **Differentiate from Peripheral Neuropathy:** This is a crucial step. A radiculopathy is a lesion of the nerve root, proximal to where the median and radial nerves are formed. A radiculopathy should affect the *entire* sensory territory of that root. For a digit, this means sensory loss should be present on **both the palmar (pulp) and dorsal aspects**. In contrast, a lesion of the median nerve would spare the dorsal surface of the digit, while a radial nerve lesion would spare the palmar surface. Therefore, assessing for **palmar–dorsal concordance** is a powerful tool to distinguish a radiculopathy from a peripheral neuropathy.\n\n4.  **Confirm Lesion Specificity:** A single-level radiculopathy (e.g., $C6$) should spare adjacent levels. Adding a **control test** in an unaffected dermatome, such as $C8$ (the little finger), helps confirm that the deficit is focal to the suspected root and not part of a more widespread process like a polyneuropathy.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Perform bilateral, side-to-side comparison of discriminative touch over both the pulp and dorsum of the thumb ($C6$) and pinprick over both the pulp and dorsum of the middle finger ($C7$), adding a control pinprick on the little finger ($C8$). Interpret as follows: if discriminative touch loss is localized to the thumb with preserved pinprick at the middle finger and normal control at the little finger, suspect $C6$ radiculopathy; if pinprick loss is localized to the middle finger with preserved thumb discriminative touch and normal control, suspect $C7$ radiculopathy. Palmar–dorsal concordance strengthens a root-level localization and reduces the likelihood of an isolated peripheral nerve lesion.**\n    This option perfectly aligns with the derived optimal strategy. It includes bilateral comparison, testing of both palmar and dorsal surfaces, use of a control dermatome ($C8$), and a correct interpretation scheme. This is the most robust and clinically sound approach.\n\n*   **B. Test only the palmar pads of the thumb and middle finger on the symptomatic side: perform pinprick on the thumb and discriminative touch on the middle finger. If either is reduced, infer the corresponding root ($C6$ for the thumb, $C7$ for the middle finger).**\n    This option is flawed. It reverses the assigned tests, omits essential bilateral comparison, and fails to test the dorsal surfaces, making it impossible to rule out a median neuropathy.\n\n*   **C. Test discriminative touch over the middle finger and pinprick over the thumb bilaterally, focusing on the pulp surfaces. If discriminative touch is reduced at the middle finger, assign $C7$; if pinprick is reduced at the thumb, assign $C6$.**\n    This option is also flawed. It reverses the assigned tests and fails to assess the dorsal surfaces, thus failing to address the peripheral nerve confounder.\n\n*   **D. Rely on two-point discrimination across all digits of the symptomatic hand and select the root based on the single worst-performing digit, without contralateral comparison or dorsal–palmar assessment, as two-point discrimination is considered the most sensitive bedside measure of DCML integrity.**\n    This option is clinically unsound. It abandons the mandatory contralateral comparison and dorsal-palmar assessment. It also ignores the instruction to test the ALS pathway with pinprick.\n\n**Conclusion:** Option A describes the most methodologically rigorous strategy to differentiate between $C6$ and $C7$ radiculopathies based on the provided principles.",

Use the core definitions of dermatomes (segmental cutaneous sensory territories), myotomes (segmental motor territories), and named peripheral nerve territories, along with the mapping of spinal segments to muscle actions, to reason from first principles about the likely lesion site.\n\nA $38$-year-old man develops progressive right-sided foot drop over $2$ weeks. He denies trauma but reports episodic low back pain. Neurological examination (Medical Research Council (MRC) $0$–$5$ scale) shows the following on the right: ankle dorsiflexion $3/5$, great toe extension $3/5$, foot eversion $2/5$, foot inversion $4-/5$, plantarflexion $5/5$, and hip abduction $4/5$.

Sciatic neuropathy predominantly affecting the fibular division",
            "solution": "The patient's clinical presentation points towards a single, unifying diagnosis that can be deduced by methodically mapping the signs and symptoms to the neuroanatomical structures of the lumbosacral plexus and its peripheral nerves.\n\n**1. Analysis of Motor Findings:**\nThe pattern of weakness is the most crucial localizing information.\n*   **Foot Drop Components:** Weakness in ankle dorsiflexion (Tibialis Anterior, primarily $L4$, **$L5$**), great toe extension (Extensor Hallucis Longus, primarily **$L5$**), and foot eversion (Fibularis muscles, primarily **$L5$**, $S1$) is evident. This pattern points strongly to dysfunction of the $L5$ myotome or the common fibular nerve.\n*   **Foot Inversion Weakness ($4-/5$):** Foot inversion is performed by the Tibialis Posterior (innervated by the Tibial Nerve, $L4$, **$L5$**). The presence of mild weakness in this muscle is inconsistent with a pure common fibular nerve palsy (which would spare this muscle) and supports a more proximal lesion involving the $L5$ root.\n*   **Hip Abduction Weakness ($4/5$):** This is a critical finding. Hip abduction is performed by the Gluteus Medius and Minimus muscles, innervated by the Superior Gluteal Nerve ($L4$, **$L5$**, $S1$). This nerve branches off the sacral plexus high in the pelvis. Any lesion distal to this point, such as a sciatic neuropathy in the thigh or a common fibular neuropathy at the knee, cannot cause hip abduction weakness. This localizes the lesion proximally to the nerve root or the lumbosacral plexus itself.\n\n**2. Analysis of Sensory Findings:**\nThe area of reduced sensation—over the lateral aspect of the leg and the dorsum of the foot, including the first dorsal web space—is the classic sensory distribution of the **$L5$ dermatome**.\n\n**3. Analysis of Reflex Findings:**\n*   The **normal Patellar Tendon Reflex** ($L4$) argues against a significant $L4$ radiculopathy.\n*   The **normal Achilles Tendon Reflex** ($S1$) argues against a significant $S1$ radiculopathy.\n*   The **diminished Medial Hamstring Reflex** ($L5$, $S1$) is consistent with an $L5$ root lesion, as the $L5$ root contributes to this reflex arc.\n\n**4. Synthesis and Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. $L5$ radiculopathy due to $L4-L5$ disc herniation compressing the $L5$ root:** This diagnosis perfectly explains all the patient's findings: weakness in the $L5$ myotome (including the crucial hip abductors and mild tibialis posterior weakness), sensory loss in the $L5$ dermatome, and the specific pattern of preserved and diminished reflexes. The history of low back pain further supports this etiology.\n\n*   **B. Common fibular (peroneal) nerve compression at the fibular neck:** This diagnosis is excluded by the presence of hip abduction weakness and foot inversion weakness. The absence of local signs at the fibular head also makes it less likely.\n\n*   **C. Deep fibular (peroneal) nerve entrapment at the ankle:** This is incorrect as it would not cause weakness in foot eversion and would result in a much smaller sensory deficit.\n\n*   **D. $L4$ radiculopathy:** This is excluded by the normal patellar reflex and the $L5$ (not $L4$) pattern of sensory and motor loss.\n\n*   **E. Sciatic neuropathy predominantly affecting the fibular division:** This is excluded by the hip abduction weakness, as the superior gluteal nerve branches off proximal to the sciatic nerve proper.\n\n**Conclusion:** A single $L5$ radiculopathy is the only lesion among the choices that accounts for the entire constellation of motor, sensory, and reflex findings.",
