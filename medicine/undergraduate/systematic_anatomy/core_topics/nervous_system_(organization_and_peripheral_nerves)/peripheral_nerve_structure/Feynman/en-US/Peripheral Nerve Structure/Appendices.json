            "problem": "In the context of peripheral nerve structure, conduction velocity in axons depends on diameter and whether the axon is myelinated by Schwann cells. Well-tested empirical relationships in systematic anatomy and neurophysiology state that for a myelinated peripheral axon of diameter $d$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), the conduction velocity scales approximately linearly with diameter as $v \\approx 6d$, while for an unmyelinated axon of the same diameter, the conduction velocity scales as $v \\approx 0.5d$. These relationships arise from cable properties of axons and structural specializations such as myelin sheaths and nodes of Ranvier.

            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and objectivity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- For a myelinated peripheral axon, the conduction velocity $v_{\\mathrm{myel}}$ is related to diameter $d$ (in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) by the empirical formula $v_{\\mathrm{myel}} \\approx 6d$.

This is the required final answer.\n- Task 3: Provide a qualitative, structurally-grounded explanation for the difference in conduction velocities.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of neurophysiology and systematic anatomy. The linear scaling of conduction velocity with diameter ($v \\propto d$) is a well-documented empirical approximation for myelinated axons (the Hursh factor). The scaling for unmyelinated axons is often cited as $v \\propto \\sqrt{d}$, but a linear approximation is acceptable for a simplified model and is not factually incorrect, merely a different level of approximation. The numerical constants ($6$ and $0.5$) are physiologically plausible. The reference to myelin, Schwann cells, and nodes of Ranvier is accurate. The problem is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary information. The empirical formulas are given, the diameter is specified, and the tasks are unambiguous. A unique solution for the requested ratio can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. It presents established empirical relationships without subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis based on the provided empirical scaling laws for axonal conduction velocity.\n\n**Task 1: Computation of Individual Conduction Velocities**\n\nWe are given the diameter of the axon as $d = 7\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The empirical relationships relate diameter in micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) directly to conduction velocity in meters per second ($\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$).\n\nFor the myelinated axon, the conduction velocity $v_{\\mathrm{myel}}$ is given by:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{myel}} \\approx 6d$$\nSubstituting the given diameter $d=7$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{myel}} \\approx 6 \\times 7 = 42\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nFor the unmyelinated axon, the conduction velocity $v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}}$ is given by:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}} \\approx 0.5d$$\nSubstituting the given diameter $d=7$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}} \\approx 0.5 \\times 7 = 3.5\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of the Velocity Ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the myelinated to unmyelinated conduction velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{myel}}/v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}}$. Using the symbolic expressions for the velocities:\n$$\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{myel}}}{v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}}} \\approx \\frac{6d}{0.5d}$$\nThe diameter $d$ is a common factor in the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This demonstrates that, for these linear scaling laws, the ratio of conduction velocities is independent of the specific axon diameter.\n$$\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{myel}}}{v_{\\mathrm{unmyel}}} \\approx \\frac{6}{0.5} = 12$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $12$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $12.00$.\n\n**Task 3: Qualitative Explanation of Velocity Difference**\n\nThe substantial difference in conduction velocity between myelinated and unmyelinated axons of the same diameter is a direct consequence of the structural specializations of the myelinated axon. This can be explained by examining how the myelin sheath alters the passive cable properties of the axon and facilitates a different mode of action potential propagation.\n\n1.  **Alteration of Membrane Properties**: The myelin sheath, formed by the wrapping of Schwann cell membranes (in the peripheral nervous system) around the axon, acts as an electrical insulator. This has two critical effects on the axon's electrical properties in the internodal regions (the myelinated segments):\n    *   **Increased Membrane Resistance ($R_m$)**: Myelin vastly increases the resistance to ion flow across the axonal membrane. This effectively \"plugs the leaks,\" preventing the ionic current that propagates the action potential from dissipating out of the axon. A higher $R_m$ increases the length constant ($\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_m/R_i}$, where $R_i$ is the internal axial resistance), allowing the depolarizing current to travel much further down the axoplasm before decaying.\n    *   **Decreased Membrane Capacitance ($C_m$)**: The myelin sheath increases the effective thickness of the membrane, separating the conductive intracellular and extracellular fluids. In a capacitor, capacitance is inversely proportional to the distance between the plates. Therefore, myelination significantly decreases the membrane capacitance. A lower $C_m$ means that less charge needs to be moved to change the membrane potential, allowing for a much faster change in voltage for a given current.\n\n2.  **Nodal Architecture and Saltatory Conduction**: The myelin sheath is not continuous; it is interrupted by gaps called the nodes of Ranvier. These nodes are highly specialized, containing a very high density of voltage-gated sodium channels. The internodal membrane, by contrast, has a very low density of these channels.\n    *   This architecture leads to **saltatory conduction**. An action potential generated at one node of Ranvier creates a rapid flow of ionic current down the well-insulated axoplasm of the internode. Due to the high length constant and low time constant ($ \\tau = R_m C_m $, which is reduced because the decrease in $C_m$ is proportionally greater than the increase in $R_m$), this current rapidly depolarizes the next node of Ranvier to its threshold potential.\n    *   The action potential is then regenerated at this next node, effectively \"jumping\" from node to node. This is a much faster and more metabolically efficient process than the continuous propagation seen in unmyelinated axons, where the action potential must be regenerated at every adjacent point along the entire length of the membrane, a comparatively slow and energy-intensive process.\n\nIn summary, the myelinated axon is faster because the myelin sheath improves the passive cable properties of the axon (increasing $R_m$, decreasing $C_m$), and the nodal architecture allows the action potential to be regenerated only at discrete, widely spaced points, resulting in rapid saltatory conduction.\n\nThe final answer required is the numerical ratio calculated in Task 2.",

We compare our calculated g-ratio to this range:\n$$0.6 \\le 0.6667 \\le 0.7$$\nThe calculated g-ratio, $g \\approx 0.6667$, falls squarely within the specified optimal range.\n\nThe g-ratio is an index of myelination. To understand its relationship with myelin thickness, we can analyze the provided definition for myelin thickness, $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{d_{\\mathrm{fiber}} - d_{\\mathrm{axon}}}{2}$$\nWe can express $t$ as a function of the g-ratio $g$ and the axon diameter $d_{\\mathrm{axon}}$.

The data provided are consistent and sufficient for the tasks required, and the problem is well-posed, objective, and mathematically formalizable.\n\nThe tasks will be addressed sequentially as requested.\n\n**1. Identification of Fascicles**\n\nThe problem asks to identify which fascicle is more likely sensory-dominant and which is motor-dominant based on the provided fiber diameter distributions. This identification relies on a fundamental principle of neurophysiology: the function of a neuron is correlated with its structure, particularly the diameter and myelination of its axon, which together determine its conduction velocity.\n\n-   **Motor (efferent) nerve fibers** that innervate skeletal muscle, known as A$\\alpha$ fibers, are among the largest and fastest-conducting neurons in the peripheral nervous system. This is a functional requirement for rapid, synchronized muscle contraction. Therefore, a nerve fascicle that is predominantly motor would be expected to have a distribution skewed towards larger diameter fibers.\n-   **Sensory (afferent) nerve fibers** serve a wider range of modalities, from fast proprioception (also A$\\alpha$ fibers) to touch (A$\\beta$ fibers) and slower pain and temperature (A$\\delta$ fibers). This functional diversity results in a broader distribution of fiber diameters, often with a significant population of smaller-diameter myelinated fibers. Unmyelinated C-fibers, which are the most numerous for pain and temperature, are not included in this dataset as it only considers myelinated axons.\n\nObserving the provided data:\n-   **Fascicle A** has a total of $395$ fibers. The distribution is heavily weighted towards smaller diameters, with the modal (most frequent) bin being $3$–$5$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (count of $120$) and a large number of fibers ($80$) in the smallest $1$–$3$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ bin.\n-   **Fascicle B** has a total of $460$ fibers. Its distribution is skewed towards larger diameters. The modal bin is $7$–$9$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ (count of $110$), with a substantial number of fibers in the even larger $9$–$11$, $11$–$13$, and $13$–$15$ $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ bins.\n\nBased on this analysis, **Fascicle B**, with its preponderance of large-diameter fibers, is characteristic of a **motor-dominant** fascicle.
