This practice problem focuses on the glutamate-glutamine cycle, a vital metabolic partnership between astrocytes and neurons that prevents the toxic buildup of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. By building a quantitative model from fundamental principles of transporter stoichiometry and enzyme kinetics, you will calculate the energetic cost, in terms of ATP, that an astrocyte must pay to perform this essential housekeeping function . This exercise sharpens your ability to connect molecular-level mechanisms to the overall metabolic demands of the brain.",

            "problem": "In the central nervous system, astrocytes maintain neurotransmitter homeostasis by clearing extracellular glutamate and converting it to glutamine, which neurons then reuse. Consider a cortical microdomain where neurons release glutamate into the extracellular space at a mean flux $F$ (in nmol/min). Astrocytes and neurons both express Excitatory Amino Acid Transporters (EAATs), and their glutamate uptake kinetics follow the same Michaelis–Menten relation with a shared half-saturation constant $K_m$ but distinct maximal velocities: $V_a$ for astrocytes and $V_n$ for neurons (each in nmol/min). Let the steady state be defined by equality of the glutamate release flux and the total uptake flux, and assume negligible non-specific clearance.\n\nUse the following well-established facts:\n- Each EAAT cycle in astrocytes co-transports $3$ extracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $1$ extracellular $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ into the astrocyte and exchanges $1$ intracellular $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ to the extracellular space per $1$ glutamate molecule transported.\n- Sodium-Potassium Adenosine Triphosphatase ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase) extrudes $3$ intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and imports $2$ extracellular $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ per $1$ adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolyzed.\n- Astrocytic glutamine synthetase consumes $1$ ATP per $1$ glutamate converted to glutamine.\n\nAssume astrocytes restore exactly the $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ per glutamate transported via one $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase cycle, ignore other ionic and metabolic costs, and assume that neuronal EAATs do not engage glutamine synthetase.\n\nDerive, from first principles and the given facts, the steady-state astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate (in nmol/min) in terms of $F$, $V_a$, $V_n$, and $K_m$. Then evaluate it for $F = 2.4$ nmol/min, $V_a = 3.0$ nmol/min, $V_n = 1.2$ nmol/min, and $K_m = 30$ $\\mu$M. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in nmol/min.",
            "solution": "The total steady-state ATP hydrolysis rate in astrocytes, $R_{ATP,a}$, consists of two components: ATP consumed by the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase ($R_{ATP,pump}$) and ATP consumed by glutamine synthetase ($R_{ATP,GS}$).\n$$R_{ATP,a} = R_{ATP,pump} + R_{ATP,GS}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the ATP cost per molecule of glutamate taken up by an astrocyte.\n- Each glutamate molecule transported into an astrocyte brings with it $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions.\n- To restore the sodium gradient, the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase must extrude these $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions. One cycle of this pump extrudes $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions and consumes $1$ ATP. Thus, the pump cost is $1$ ATP per glutamate.\n- Glutamine synthetase consumes $1$ ATP to convert $1$ glutamate molecule to glutamine.\n- The total astrocytic ATP cost per glutamate molecule is $1 + 1 = 2$ ATP.\n\nLet $J_a$ be the steady-state glutamate uptake flux into astrocytes (in nmol/min). The total astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate is then:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = 2 J_a$$\nTo find $J_a$, we model the system at steady state. Let $[Glu]$ be the steady-state extracellular glutamate concentration. The uptake fluxes for astrocytes ($J_a$) and neurons ($J_n$) follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics:\n$$J_a = V_a \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\n$$J_n = V_n \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\nAt steady state, the total glutamate release flux, $F$, must equal the total uptake flux, $J_{total} = J_a + J_n$.\n$$F = J_a + J_n = (V_a + V_n) \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]}$$\nWe can solve for the fractional saturation term:\n$$\\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} = \\frac{F}{V_a + V_n}$$\nNow, substitute this term back into the equation for $J_a$:\n$$J_a = V_a \\left( \\frac{[Glu]}{K_m + [Glu]} \\right) = V_a \\left( \\frac{F}{V_a + V_n} \\right) = \\frac{V_a F}{V_a + V_n}$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $J_a$ into the ATP rate equation:\n$$R_{ATP,a} = 2 J_a = \\frac{2 V_a F}{V_a + V_n}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady-state astrocytic ATP hydrolysis rate. The value of $K_m$ is not needed for the final calculation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the expression with the given values:\n- $F = 2.4$ nmol/min\n- $V_a = 3.0$ nmol/min\n- $V_n = 1.2$ nmol/min\n\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{2 \\times 3.0 \\times 2.4}{3.0 + 1.2} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\n$$R_{ATP,a} = \\frac{14.4}{4.2} \\, \\text{nmol/min} = \\frac{24}{7} \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\n$$R_{ATP,a} \\approx 3.4285714... \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$R_{ATP,a} \\approx 3.429 \\, \\text{nmol/min}$$",

This raises a fundamental question of biological design: how much myelin is the optimal amount?

Using a utility function that models the trade-off between the benefit of fast conduction and the metabolic cost of maintaining the myelin sheath, you will use calculus to derive the ideal $g$-ratio. This practice provides a powerful example of how optimization principles can reveal the efficiency underlying neuroanatomical structures.",

            "problem": "In systematic anatomy of the nervous system, myelination by neuroglia modulates axonal conduction while incurring metabolic maintenance costs. In the Central Nervous System (CNS), oligodendrocytes wrap axons to form myelin; in the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS), Schwann cells perform an analogous role. Consider a single myelinated axon with inner (axon) diameter $d$ and outer (fiber) diameter $D$, where the myelin sheath thickness is $t$ so that $D = d + 2t$. The $g$-ratio is defined as $g = \\frac{d}{D}$.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- For myelinated axons under fixed internodal architecture, the conduction velocity is empirically well approximated as increasing linearly with outer fiber diameter, that is, $v(D) \\propto D$.\n- The neuroglial metabolic maintenance cost per unit length for myelin is proportional to the myelin cross-sectional area, which is $A_{m} = \\pi \\left(D^{2} - d^{2}\\right)$.\n\nSuppose the net utility per unit length of the fiber is modeled as a weighted difference between conduction utility and glial maintenance cost:\n$$U(D) = \\gamma D - \\beta \\left(D^{2} - d^{2}\\right),$$\nwhere $\\gamma > 0$ subsumes the proportionality between conduction velocity and $D$ and the weighting of conduction utility, and $\\beta > 0$ is the metabolic cost density coefficient per unit cross-sectional area of myelin.

Express the final $g$-ratio as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the optimal $g$-ratio, denoted as $g^{*}$, that maximizes the net utility function $U(D)$ for a myelinated axon. Subsequently, this optimal $g$-ratio is to be calculated for a specific set of parameters. The inner axon diameter is denoted by $d$ and the outer fiber diameter is $D$. The utility function is given as:\n$$U(D) = \\gamma D - \\beta \\left(D^{2} - d^{2}\\right)$$\nThis function is to be maximized with respect to $D$, under the physical constraint that $D > d$. The parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants, and $d$ is treated as a fixed parameter.\n\nFirst, we find the value of $D$ that maximizes $U(D)$. This is a standard optimization problem that can be solved using differential calculus. We compute the first derivative of $U(D)$ with respect to $D$:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dD} = \\frac{d}{dD} \\left[ \\gamma D - \\beta \\left(D^{2} - d^{2}\\right) \\right]$$\n$$= \\frac{d}{dD} \\left[ \\gamma D - \\beta D^{2} + \\beta d^{2} \\right]$$\nSince $d$ is a constant, $\\beta d^{2}$ is also a constant. The derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dU}{dD} = \\gamma - 2\\beta D$$\nTo find the critical points, we set the first derivative equal to zero:\n$$\\gamma - 2\\beta D = 0$$\nSolving for $D$, we find the optimal outer diameter, which we denote as $D^{*}$:\n$$2\\beta D^{*} = \\gamma$$\n$$D^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\beta}$$\nTo confirm that this value of $D$ corresponds to a maximum, we examine the second derivative of the utility function:\n$$\\frac{d^2U}{dD^2} = \\frac{d}{dD} \\left( \\gamma - 2\\beta D \\right) = -2\\beta$$\nGiven that $\\beta > 0$, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2U}{dD^2}$ is strictly negative. This confirms that $D^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\beta}$ yields a local maximum. As $U(D)$ is a quadratic function of $D$ with a negative leading coefficient ($-\\beta$), this local maximum is the global maximum.\n\nThe physical constraint $D > d$ must be satisfied. Therefore, our solution for $D^{*}$ is valid if $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\beta} > d$. If this condition were not met, the maximum utility would occur at the boundary of the feasible domain, i.e., as $D$ approaches $d$. However, we proceed assuming an interior maximum.\n\nThe $g$-ratio is defined as $g = \\frac{d}{D}$. The optimal $g$-ratio, $g^{*}$, corresponds to the optimal outer diameter $D^{*}$:\n$$g^{*} = \\frac{d}{D^{*}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D^{*}$:\n$$g^{*} = \\frac{d}{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\beta}} = \\frac{2\\beta d}{\\gamma}$$\nThis is the general expression for the optimal $g$-ratio that maximizes the net utility per unit length of the fiber.\n\nNext, we are tasked with computing the numerical value of $g^{*}$ using the provided data:\n- Inner axon diameter, $d = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Conduction utility coefficient, $\\gamma = 1.0$ (in consistent units)\n- Metabolic cost coefficient, $\\beta = 0.3$ (in consistent units)\n\nFirst, let's verify the physical validity constraint with these numbers. The optimal diameter is:\n$$D^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\beta} = \\frac{1.0}{2 \\times 0.3} = \\frac{1.0}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{3} \\approx 1.667\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nSince $d = 1.0\\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, the condition $D^{*} > d$ is satisfied ($1.667 > 1.0$), confirming that the unconstrained maximum is physically permissible.\n\nNow we can compute the optimal $g$-ratio using the derived formula:\n$$g^{*} = \\frac{2\\beta d}{\\gamma}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$g^{*} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.3 \\times 1.0}{1.0} = \\frac{0.6}{1.0} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
