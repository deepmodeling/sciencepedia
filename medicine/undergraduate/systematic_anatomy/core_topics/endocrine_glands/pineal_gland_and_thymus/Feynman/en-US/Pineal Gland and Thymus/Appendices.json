The thymus provides a classic example, originating in the neck and migrating caudally to the superior mediastinum. This exercise models this crucial developmental process by linking the thymus's displacement to the overall axial growth of the embryo, represented by a logistic function for Crown-Rump Length (CRL) . By applying principles of calculus, you will calculate the duration of this migration, gaining insight into how organogenesis is dynamically coordinated with the body's changing dimensions.",

            "problem": "A core anatomical observation is that the thymus originates from the third pharyngeal pouch in the embryonic neck and undergoes a caudal migration to reach the superior mediastinum, whereas the pineal gland forms in the diencephalon and does not undergo comparable axial migration. In developmental anatomy, a first-principles approximation models organ positional change driven by differential axial growth (elongation of the neck and thorax). Let the thymic primordium begin migrating at gestational age $t_{0}$, and suppose its instantaneous caudal displacement speed $v(t)$ is proportional to the axial growth rate of the Crown–Rump Length (CRL), written as $L(t)$, so that $v(t) = \\alpha \\frac{dL}{dt}$, where $0 < \\alpha < 1$ is a dimensionless anatomical proportionality factor capturing how much CRL elongation maps to the neck-to-superior-mediastinum descent pathway.

Let this quantity be denoted by $E[S]$.\n\nFirst, we determine the probability of a single thymocyte surviving. Let $A$ be the event that a thymocyte passes positive selection. The problem states this probability is:\n$$P(A) = p_{+}$$\nLet $E_N$ be the event that a thymocyte is eliminated by negative selection. The problem states that this elimination is conditional upon passing positive selection. This gives us the conditional probability:\n$$P(E_N | A) = p_{-}$$\nA thymocyte survives if it passes positive selection (event $A$) and is *not* eliminated by negative selection (the complementary event $E_N^c$). We want to find the probability of the intersection of these two events, $P(A \\cap E_N^c)$.\n\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$P(A \\cap E_N^c) = P(E_N^c | A) \\cdot P(A)$$\nThe probability of not being eliminated by negative selection, given that positive selection was passed, is:\n$$P(E_N^c | A) = 1 - P(E_N | A) = 1 - p_{-}$$\nSubstituting the known probabilities, the survival probability for a single thymocyte, which we denote as $p_{\\text{survive}}$, is:\n$$p_{\\text{survive}} = P(A \\cap E_N^c) = (1 - p_{-}) \\cdot p_{+}$$\n\nNow, consider the cohort of $N$ thymocytes entering the thymus. Each thymocyte's fate is an independent Bernoulli trial. For each thymocyte $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$), let us define a random variable $X_i$ such that:\n- $X_i = 1$ if thymocyte $i$ survives both selection processes.\n- $X_i = 0$ if thymocyte $i$ does not survive.\n\nThe probability of success for each trial is $p_{\\text{survive}}$. Therefore, the expected value of $X_i$ is:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = P(X_i=1) = p_{\\text{survive}}$$\n$$E[X_i] = p_{+} (1 - p_{-})$$\nThe total number of surviving thymocytes, $S$, is the sum of the outcomes for all $N$ thymocytes:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nAccording to the problem, we must use the property of the expected value of a sum of random variables. By the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of survivors is the sum of the individual expected values:\n$$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince each thymocyte is an independent and identically distributed trial, $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$. Thus, we have:\n$$E[S] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{\\text{survive}} = N \\cdot p_{\\text{survive}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{\\text{survive}}$, we arrive at the final expression for the expected number of surviving thymocytes per day:\n$$E[S] = N p_{+} (1 - p_{-})$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles as required.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $N = 10^{8}$, $p_{+} = 0.1$, and $p_{-} = 0.9$.\n$$E[S] = 10^{8} \\cdot (0.1) \\cdot (1 - 0.9)$$\n$$E[S] = 10^{8} \\cdot (0.1) \\cdot (0.1)$$\n$$E[S] = 10^{8} \\cdot 10^{-1} \\cdot 10^{-1}$$\n$$E[S] = 10^{8-1-1} = 10^{6}$$\nThe expected number of surviving thymocytes per day is $1,000,000$.",
