            "problem": "A spinal nerve is formed by the union of a dorsal (posterior) root and a ventral (anterior) root, with the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) located on the dorsal root. Each mixed spinal nerve exits the vertebral column through an intervertebral foramen bounded superiorly and inferiorly by the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae. The vertebral column has $7$ cervical vertebrae, $12$ thoracic vertebrae, $5$ lumbar vertebrae, $5$ sacral segments fused into the sacrum, and a coccyx, while there are $31$ pairs of spinal nerves: $8$ cervical, $12$ thoracic, $5$ lumbar, $5$ sacral, and $1$ coccygeal. The anatomical naming convention links spinal nerve numbering to vertebral numbering, but the geometry of the foramina and the count mismatch in the cervical region constrain how the nerves must exit.\n\nBased on these fundamental definitions and counts, select all statements that must be true about the numbering and exits of human spinal nerves and the clinical implications for common posterolateral disc herniations:\n\nA.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- A spinal nerve is formed by the union of a dorsal (posterior) root and a ventral (anterior) root.\n- The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) is located on the dorsal root.\n- Each mixed spinal nerve exits the vertebral column through an intervertebral foramen.\n- An intervertebral foramen is bounded superiorly and inferiorly by the pedicles of adjacent vertebrae.\n- Vertebral column composition: $7$ cervical vertebrae ($C1$ to $C7$), $12$ thoracic vertebrae ($T1$ to $T12$), $5$ lumbar vertebrae ($L1$ to $L5$), $5$ sacral segments fused into the sacrum, and a coccyx.\n- Spinal nerve pairs count: $31$ pairs total, consisting of $8$ cervical ($C1$ to $C8$), $12$ thoracic ($T1$ to $T12$), $5$ lumbar ($L1$ to $L5$), $5$ sacral ($S1$ to $S5$), and $1$ coccygeal ($Co1$).\n- The problem states that nerve and vertebral numbering are linked, but the exit pattern is constrained by foramen geometry and the count mismatch in the cervical region ($7$ vertebrae vs. $8$ nerve pairs).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem statement is based on fundamental and factually correct principles of human gross anatomy. The counts of vertebrae and spinal nerves are standard.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of facts and asks for necessary logical consequences of these facts. The core of the problem, the mismatch between cervical vertebrae count ($7$) and cervical spinal nerve count ($8$), is a key constraint that makes the problem solvable through deduction rather than being underspecified.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjectivity or bias.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically sound, and objective question rooted in systematic anatomy. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis hinges on deducing the spinal nerve exit pattern from the provided counts. We have $N_C = 7$ cervical vertebrae and $n_C = 8$ cervical spinal nerve pairs. Spinal nerves exit through intervertebral foramina, which are formed between adjacent vertebrae. An additional exit pathway must exist to accommodate the extra cervical nerve.\n\n1.  **Cervical Exit Pattern**: There are $7$ cervical vertebrae, creating $7$ primary intervertebral foramina below each corresponding pedicle (from $C1-C2$ to $C7-T1$). To accommodate $8$ nerves, an eighth exit path is needed. This path is located between the occiput (skull) and the first cervical vertebra, $C1$ (the atlas). Logically, the nerves are numbered sequentially from superior to inferior.\n    - The $C1$ spinal nerve exits between the occiput and the $C1$ vertebra. It exits *superior* to the $C1$ vertebra.\n    - The $C2$ spinal nerve exits through the $C1-C2$ intervertebral foramen, which is *superior* to the $C2$ vertebra.\n    - This pattern continues downward: the spinal nerve $C_k$ (for $k \\in \\{1, 2, ..., 7\\}$) exits through the foramen between vertebrae $C_{k-1}$ and $C_k$ (with $C_0$ representing the occiput), meaning it exits *superior* to the vertebra $C_k$.\n    - This rule accounts for the first $7$ cervical nerves. The last cervical nerve, $C8$, must exit below the last cervical vertebra, $C7$. There is no $C8$ vertebra. The next vertebra is $T1$. Therefore, the $C8$ spinal nerve exits through the intervertebral foramen between $C7$ and $T1$. This exit is *inferior* to the $C7$ vertebra.\n\n2.  **Thoracic, Lumbar, and Sacral Exit Pattern**: The exit of the $C8$ nerve inferior to the $C7$ vertebra establishes a new pattern that continues for the rest of the spinal column.\n    - The $T1$ spinal nerve exits through the foramen between $T1$ and $T2$, which is *inferior* to the $T1$ vertebra.\n    - In general, for any thoracic ($T_k$), lumbar ($L_k$), or sacral ($S_k$) spinal nerve, it exits through the foramen between vertebra $V_k$ and $V_{k+1}$, where $V$ represents the vertebra type ($T$, $L$). Thus, the nerve exits *inferior* to its same-numbered vertebra.\n\n3.  **Clinical Implication for Disc Herniation**: A posterolateral herniation of an intervertebral disc at level $V_k-V_{k+1}$ typically compresses the nerve root that is traversing the spinal canal at that level to exit at a lower foramen.\n    - In the **cervical spine**, nerve roots take a relatively horizontal path to their nearby exit foramen. A herniation at $C6-C7$ will directly impinge on the nerve structures in the $C6-C7$ foramen, which is the exiting $C7$ nerve root.\n    - In the **lumbar spine**, the spinal cord ends around the $L1-L2$ level (conus medullaris). Below this, the cauda equina, a collection of descending nerve roots, travels inferiorly to reach respective exit foramina. At the $L4-L5$ disc level, the $L4$ nerve root is already exiting high in the lateral part of the $L4-L5$ foramen. The $L5$ nerve root, however, is traversing the canal at this level, passing directly posterior to the $L4-L5$ disc on its way to the $L5-S1$ foramen. Therefore, a typical posterolateral $L4-L5$ disc herniation will compress the traversing $L5$ nerve root.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The $C1$ spinal nerve exits between the occiput and the atlas, superior to the $C1$ vertebra.**\n- As derived above, to account for $8$ cervical nerves with only $7$ cervical vertebrae, the numbering scheme must begin with the $C1$ nerve exiting above the first cervical vertebra ($C1$, the atlas). The space for this exit is between the atlas and the occipital bone of the skull. This statement is a direct consequence of the anatomical counts.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The $C7$ spinal nerve exits superior to the $C7$ vertebral pedicle, and the $C8$ spinal nerve exits between $C7$ and $T1$.**\n- First part: Following the cervical rule, the $C7$ nerve exits superior to the $C7$ vertebra. It passes through the intervertebral foramen between the $C6$ and $C7$ vertebrae. The inferior border of this foramen is the pedicle of $C7$. Thus, the $C7$ nerve exits superior to the $C7$ pedicle. This is correct.\n- Second part: As derived, the $C8$ nerve is the \"extra\" cervical nerve without a corresponding vertebra. It must exit below the last cervical vertebra ($C7$) and above the first thoracic vertebra ($T1$). This occurs through the $C7-T1$ intervertebral foramen. This is also correct.\n- Since both parts of the statement are true, the entire statement is true.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. All thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves exit inferior to the pedicle of their same-numbered vertebra (for example, the $L4$ spinal nerve exits below the $L4$ pedicle within the $L4$–$L5$ foramen).**\n- The transition occurs with the $C8$ nerve exiting below $C7$. This establishes the rule for all subsequent levels. The $T1$ nerve exits below $T1$, $T2$ below $T2$, and so on. The $L4$ spinal nerve exits below the $L4$ vertebra. The foramen for its exit is the $L4-L5$ intervertebral foramen, which is bounded superiorly by the pedicle of the $L4$ vertebra. Therefore, the nerve passes inferior to the pedicle of the $L4$ vertebra. The general statement and the example are both accurate descriptions of the anatomy inferior to the cervical region.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. A posterolateral disc herniation at $C6$–$C7$ typically compresses the $C7$ spinal nerve, whereas at $L4$–$L5$ it compresses the $L4$ spinal nerve.**\n- First part: A posterolateral herniation of the $C6-C7$ disc will impinge on the neural structures at that level. The nerve exiting the $C6-C7$ foramen is the $C7$ spinal nerve. This part is correct.\n- Second part: A posterolateral herniation of the $L4-L5$ disc will impinge on the nerve root crossing the disc at that level. As explained in the derivation, due to the descending path of the cauda equina roots, the nerve crossing the posterior aspect of the $L4-L5$ disc is the *traversing L5 nerve root*, not the exiting $L4$ nerve root. The statement that it compresses the $L4$ spinal nerve is incorrect for a typical posterolateral herniation.\n- Because one part of the conjunction is false, the entire statement is false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The coccygeal spinal nerve ($Co1$) exits below the coccyx through an intervertebral foramen between $Co1$ and $Co2$.**\n- The problem states the coccyx is composed of fused segments. In a fused structure, there are no intervertebral foramina. The coccygeal vertebrae ($Co1$, $Co2$, etc.) are fused into a single bone, so no foramen exists between them. The $S5$ and $Co1$ spinal nerves actually exit the vertebral canal via an opening at the inferior end of the sacrum called the sacral hiatus. The premise of exiting through a $Co1-Co2$ intervertebral foramen is anatomically false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the shear component of a compressive force acting on a cervical facet joint. The solution will be derived from the first principles of vector decomposition.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the geometry and the forces involved. Let the transverse plane be the horizontal reference plane. The compressive joint reaction force, denoted by the vector $\\vec{F}$, has a magnitude $F = 200\\ \\mathrm{N}$ and acts along the superior-inferior axis. By definition, this axis is perpendicular to the transverse plane. Therefore, the force vector $\\vec{F}$ is normal to the transverse plane.\n\nThe facet surface is oriented at an angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$ relative to the transverse plane. We are tasked with decomposing the force $\\vec{F}$ into two orthogonal components:\n$1$. A component perpendicular to the facet surface, known as the normal force, $\\vec{F}_N$.\n$2$. A component parallel (tangential) to the facet surface, known as the shear force, $\\vec{F}_S$.\n\nThe sum of these two vector components must equal the original force vector:\n$$ \\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_N + \\vec{F}_S $$\n\nLet us analyze the angles involved. The force vector $\\vec{F}$ is perpendicular to the transverse plane. The facet surface forms an angle $\\theta$ with the transverse plane. Consider a line normal to the facet surface. The angle between this normal line and the force vector $\\vec{F}$ can be determined. Since $\\vec{F}$ is perpendicular to the transverse plane, and the normal to the facet surface makes an angle $\\theta$ with the line perpendicular to the transverse plane, the angle between the force vector $\\vec{F}$ and the normal to the facet surface is precisely $\\theta$.\n\nThe magnitude of the normal force component, $F_N$, is the projection of the total force $\\vec{F}$ onto the direction normal to the facet surface. This projection is given by:\n$$ F_N = F \\cos(\\theta) $$\nwhere $F_N$ is the magnitude of $\\vec{F}_N$.\n\nThe shear force component, $\\vec{F}_S$, and the normal force component, $\\vec{F}_N$, are orthogonal by definition. Therefore, the magnitudes of the vectors $\\vec{F}$, $\\vec{F}_N$, and $\\vec{F}_S$ form a right-angled triangle, with $F$ as the hypotenuse. According to the Pythagorean theorem:\n$$ F^2 = F_N^2 + F_S^2 $$\n\nWe can now derive the expression for the magnitude of the shear force, $F_S$. Rearranging the equation:\n$$ F_S^2 = F^2 - F_N^2 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $F_N$:\n$$ F_S^2 = F^2 - (F \\cos(\\theta))^2 = F^2(1 - \\cos^2(\\theta)) $$\nUsing the fundamental trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) + \\cos^2(\\theta) = 1$, we have $1 - \\cos^2(\\theta) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$. Substituting this into the equation for $F_S^2$:\n$$ F_S^2 = F^2 \\sin^2(\\theta) $$\nTaking the square root of both sides, and considering that magnitudes are non-negative, we arrive at the general expression for the shear force component:\n$$ F_S = F \\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the component of the compressive force that acts tangentially along the facet surface.\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the numerical value for the given parameters:\n- Magnitude of the compressive force, $F = 200\\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n- Orientation angle of the facet surface, $\\theta = 45^\\circ$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $F_S$:\n$$ F_S = (200\\ \\mathrm{N}) \\times \\sin(45^\\circ) $$\nThe exact value of $\\sin(45^\\circ)$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n$$ F_S = 200 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 100\\sqrt{2}\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we use the approximation for $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$.\n$$ F_S \\approx 100 \\times 1.41421356... = 141.421356...\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "A typical cervical or thoracic motion segment comprises an intervertebral disc and a pair of zygapophyseal (facet) joints that share compressive loads under static equilibrium. Under static equilibrium, the sum of vertical reaction forces transmitted through the disc and both facet joints equals the externally applied compressive load.
