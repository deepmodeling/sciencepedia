            "problem": "Cervical mucus within the cervical canal is a viscoelastic secretion whose viscosity depends on the structure and hydration of its mucin network.

As per the instructions, the first step is to perform a rigorous validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and conditions provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n- Modeling assumption: The fractional rate of change of viscosity ($\\eta$) with respect to estrogen concentration ($[E]$) is a negative constant, $-k$. This can be written in the limit as: $\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{d\\eta}{d[E]} = -k$.\n- The sensitivity parameter $k$ is positive, $k > 0$.\n- Boundary condition (early follicular phase): At an estrogen concentration of $[E]_F = 0.200$ nM, the viscosity is $\\eta_F = 0.650$ Pa·s.\n- Target concentration (preovulatory peak): $[E]_O = 1.200$ nM.\n- Value of the sensitivity parameter: $k = 4.00$ nM$^{-1}$.\n- Task 1: Derive the functional form of $\\eta([E])$ and express its constant of integration in terms of the given boundary condition.\n- Task 2: Calculate the viscosity $\\eta([E]_O)$ at the preovulatory estrogen concentration and round the final numerical answer to four significant figures.\n- Task 3: Provide a brief anatomical/microstructural interpretation of the parameter $k$ and the multiplicative constant in the derived expression for $\\eta([E])$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of reproductive physiology and biophysics. The inverse relationship between estrogen levels and cervical mucus viscosity is a well-documented biological phenomenon critical for fertility. Modeling this relationship with a first-order differential equation, which leads to an exponential decay model, is a standard and valid simplification in biophysical modeling. The provided numerical values for estrogen concentrations and viscosity are within physiologically plausible ranges.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a first-order ordinary differential equation and a specific boundary condition ($\\eta_F$ at $[E]_F$), which allows for the determination of a unique solution. All necessary parameters ($k$, $[E]_F$, $\\eta_F$, $[E]_O$) are provided to solve for the requested quantities.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in clear, objective, and quantitative language. It is free from ambiguity, subjective claims, or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, infeasibility, or ambiguity). It is a formalizable and solvable problem in applied mathematics and biophysics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: deriving a formula for viscosity, calculating a specific value, and interpreting the model's parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Viscosity Function $\\eta([E])$**\n\nThe core modeling assumption is that the fractional rate of change of viscosity $\\eta$ with respect to estrogen concentration $[E]$ is a negative constant $-k$. This is expressed mathematically as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\frac{d\\eta}{d[E]} = -k $$\nThis equation is separable. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $\\eta$ and $[E]$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\eta}{\\eta} = -k \\, d[E] $$\nTo find the relationship between $\\eta$ and $[E]$, we integrate both sides of the equation.\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{\\eta} \\, d\\eta = \\int -k \\, d[E] $$\nSince $k$ is stated to be a constant, the integration yields:\n$$ \\ln(\\eta) = -k[E] + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To solve for $\\eta([E])$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$ \\eta([E]) = \\exp(-k[E] + C) = \\exp(C) \\exp(-k[E]) $$\nLet us define a new constant $A = \\exp(C)$. The general solution for the viscosity is thus:\n$$ \\eta([E]) = A \\exp(-k[E]) $$\nNext, we must fix the constant $A$ using the provided boundary condition: at $[E] = [E]_F$, the viscosity is $\\eta = \\eta_F$. Substituting these values into the general solution:\n$$ \\eta_F = A \\exp(-k[E]_F) $$\nSolving for the constant $A$:\n$$ A = \\eta_F \\exp(k[E]_F) $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $A$ back into the general solution to obtain the specific solution for $\\eta([E])$ expressed in terms of the known boundary condition:\n$$ \\eta([E]) = (\\eta_F \\exp(k[E]_F)) \\exp(-k[E]) $$\nUsing the properties of exponential functions, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\eta([E]) = \\eta_F \\exp(k[E]_F - k[E]) = \\eta_F \\exp(k([E]_F - [E])) $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Viscosity at Preovulatory Estrogen Concentration**\n\nWe are asked to calculate the viscosity $\\eta([E]_O)$ at the preovulatory estrogen concentration $[E]_O = 1.200$ nM. We use the derived formula and substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\eta_F = 0.650$ Pa·s\n- $k = 4.00$ nM$^{-1}$\n- $[E]_F = 0.200$ nM\n- $[E]_O = 1.200$ nM\n\nThe expression for $\\eta([E]_O)$ is:\n$$ \\eta([E]_O) = \\eta_F \\exp(k([E]_F - [E]_O)) $$\nFirst, we calculate the argument of the exponential function. The units must be consistent; here, the unit of $k$ (nM$^{-1}$) and the units of concentration (nM) cancel to produce a dimensionless exponent, as required.\n$$ k([E]_F - [E]_O) = (4.00 \\, \\text{nM}^{-1}) \\times (0.200 \\, \\text{nM} - 1.200 \\, \\text{nM}) $$\n$$ = (4.00 \\, \\text{nM}^{-1}) \\times (-1.00 \\, \\text{nM}) $$\n$$ = -4.00 $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $\\eta([E]_O)$:\n$$ \\eta([E]_O) = (0.650 \\, \\text{Pa·s}) \\times \\exp(-4.00) $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\eta([E]_O) \\approx (0.650) \\times (0.0183156) \\, \\text{Pa·s} $$\n$$ \\eta([E]_O) \\approx 0.01190514 \\, \\text{Pa·s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\eta([E]_O) \\approx 0.01191 \\, \\text{Pa·s} $$\nThis completes the second task.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of Parameters**\n\nThe final task is to interpret the parameters $k$ and the multiplicative constant $A$.\n- **Interpretation of $k$**: The parameter $k$ is the sensitivity constant. From the originating differential equation, $k = -\\frac{1}{\\eta}\\frac{d\\eta}{d[E]}$, it represents the fractional decrease in viscosity per unit increase in estrogen concentration. In anatomical and microstructural terms, $k$ quantifies the responsiveness of the cervical mucus's mucin network to estrogenic stimulation. A higher value of $k$ indicates that the mucus microstructure is highly sensitive to rising estrogen, leading to a more rapid dissociation of mucin polymers, increased hydration, and a faster drop in viscosity. This high sensitivity is crucial for the rapid transformation of the mucus from a thick, infertile barrier to a thin, watery medium that facilitates sperm transport through the cervical canal around the time of ovulation.\n\n- **Interpretation of the multiplicative constant $A$**: The constant $A$ appears in the general solution $\\eta([E]) = A \\exp(-k[E])$. From this form, we can see that if we were to extrapolate to a hypothetical state of zero estrogen concentration ($[E]=0$), the viscosity would be $\\eta(0) = A \\exp(0) = A$. Thus, $A$ represents the theoretical maximum viscosity of the cervical mucus in the complete absence of estrogen. Anatomically, this constant corresponds to the intrinsic viscosity of the fully assembled, densely cross-linked, and minimally hydrated mucin network. It is a baseline property determined by the molecular structure of the mucin glycoproteins themselves, before modulation by hormonal signals. We calculated it as $A = \\eta_F \\exp(k[E]_F)$. Using the given values, $A = (0.650) \\exp(4.00 \\times 0.200) = 0.650 \\exp(0.800) \\approx 1.446$ Pa·s. This represents the extrapolated viscosity at $[E]=0$.",

Use the following foundational bases without introducing shortcut end-results: (i) secretion is a volumetric inflow quantified by a rate $Q_{\\text{in}}$, (ii) obstruction sets the outflow $Q_{\\text{out}}$ to $0$, so the net rate of change of luminal volume satisfies $\\frac{dV}{dt}=Q_{\\text{in}}-Q_{\\text{out}}$, (iii) tissue compliance relates small changes in volume and pressure via $dV=C\\,dP$, and (iv) thin-walled structures experience wall tension $T$ that scales with luminal pressure $P$ and radius $r$ (for a spherical approximation, $T=\\frac{P\\,r}{2}$).

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following foundational bases and conditions:\n- **Anatomy and Pathology:** A mucous-secreting cervical gland duct, lined by columnar epithelium, becomes obstructed at its ostium by squamous metaplastic epithelium.\n- **Fluid Dynamics:**\n    - Secretion is a volumetric inflow rate, $Q_{\\text{in}}$.\n    - Obstruction sets outflow rate to zero: $Q_{\\text{out}} = 0$.\n    - Net rate of change of luminal volume: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = Q_{\\text{in}} - Q_{\\text{out}}$.\n- **Biophysics:**\n    - Tissue compliance relates volume and pressure changes: $dV = C\\,dP$.\n    - Wall tension $T$ in a thin-walled spherical structure scales with luminal pressure $P$ and radius $r$: $T = \\frac{P\\,r}{2}$.\n- **Histological Response:** Sustained mechanical strain on the stroma leads to fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and a relative reduction in water content.\n- **Ultrasound Physics:**\n    - Fluid with low particulate content has low acoustic backscatter (implying it is anechoic) and low attenuation relative to soft tissue (implying it causes posterior acoustic enhancement).\n- **MRI Physics:**\n    - Free water has long transverse relaxation times ($T_2$), appearing hyperintense on $T_2$-weighted images.\n    - Proteinaceous fluid shortens $T_2$ and may raise longitudinal relaxation signal ($T_1$).\n    - Dense fibrous tissue exhibits low $T_2$ signal.\n    - Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) is high in free fluid and is reduced by viscosity, cellularity, or proteinaceous crowding.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem asks to deduce the sequence of events from gland obstruction to cyst formation, including the stromal response and the correlation with imaging findings, based on the provided principles.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes the pathogenesis of a Nabothian cyst (a benign cervical retention cyst), which is a common and well-understood clinical entity. The provided principles from fluid dynamics ($\\frac{dV}{dt}$), biophysics ($dV=C\\,dP$, Law of Laplace), histology (fibrosis in response to strain), and imaging physics (ultrasound and MRI characteristics of fluid and fibrous tissue) are all standard and fundamentally correct. The scenario is scientifically realistic and grounded in established medical science.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a set of axioms and asks for their logical integration to describe a multi-stage process and its observable characteristics. It is structured to guide the reasoning toward a specific, verifiable conclusion. A unique and meaningful solution can be derived from the premises.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or controversial claims. All bases for reasoning are explicitly stated.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or unrealistic. It poses a substantive question that requires the integration of multiple concepts, making it a valid and well-posed problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of Solution\nBased on the provided principles, we can construct the sequence of events and their imaging correlates.\n\n1.  **Cyst Formation and Expansion:**\n    - With the duct obstructed, $Q_{\\text{out}} = 0$.\n    - The gland continues to secrete mucus, so $Q_{\\text{in}} > 0$.\n    - The net rate of volume change is $\\frac{dV}{dt} = Q_{\\text{in}} - Q_{\\text{out}} = Q_{\\text{in}} > 0$. This means the volume $V$ of the gland lumen continuously increases, leading to cystic dilatation.\n    - The compliance relationship, $dV = C\\,dP$, can be rewritten as $\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{1}{C}\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{in}}}{C}$. Since $Q_{\\text{in}} > 0$ and compliance $C > 0$, the pressure $P$ inside the lumen must rise as it fills with fluid.\n    - The law of Laplace for a sphere, $T = \\frac{Pr}{2}$, indicates that the rising internal pressure $P$ and increasing radius $r$ lead to a significant increase in wall tension $T$. This tension is the mechanical strain exerted on the surrounding cervical stroma.\n\n2.  **Stromal Response:**\n    - The problem explicitly states that \"sustained mechanical strain\" (i.e., the wall tension) induces \"fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, and relative reduction in water content\" in the surrounding stroma.\n    - This is the definition of fibrosis. The result is the formation of a dense, collagen-rich, relatively dehydrated fibrous capsule or rim around the expanding cyst.\n\n3.  **Correlation with Imaging Findings:**\n\n    - **Ultrasound:**\n        - **Cyst Contents:** The accumulated mucus is primarily fluid. Based on the given principle, \"fluid with low particulate content has low acoustic backscatter,\" the contents of the cyst will appear dark, i.e., **anechoic**.\n        - **Posterior Phenomenon:** The principle also states that such fluid has \"low acoustic attenuation.\" This means ultrasound waves pass through the cyst with less energy loss compared to the surrounding solid tissue. The tissue plane posterior to the cyst therefore receives stronger returning echoes, appearing brighter. This phenomenon is known as **posterior acoustic enhancement**.\n        - **Wall:** The cyst will be a well-defined, spherical or ovoid structure. The fibrotic rim may be visible as a thin, well-circumscribed wall.\n\n    - **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):**\n        - **Cyst Contents (Signal Intensity):** The primary component is fluid (water). The principle states that \"long transverse relaxation times ($T_2$) are typical of free water.\" This results in a very high signal on $T_2$-weighted images, i.e., the cyst lumen will be **$T_2$ hyperintense** (bright). Simple fluid is typically low signal on $T_1$-weighted images ($T_1$ hypointense, dark). However, the problem notes that \"proteinaceous fluid shortens $T_2$ and may raise longitudinal relaxation signal ($T_1$),\" so a $T_1$ hyperintense signal is possible but not universal.\n        - **Cyst Wall/Rim:** The stromal response is fibrosis, creating a dense fibrous capsule. The principle states that \"dense fibrous tissue commonly exhibits low $T_2$ signal.\" Therefore, the fibrotic rim will appear as a thin, dark ring on $T_2$-weighted images, i.e., **$T_2$ hypointense**.\n        - **Diffusion (ADC):** The principle states that \"Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) is high in free fluid.\" The cystic fluid, unless extremely viscous, consists of relatively mobile water molecules. Therefore, it will show unrestricted diffusion, corresponding to a **high ADC value**.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With $Q_{\\text{out}}=0$, $\\frac{dV}{dt}=Q_{\\text{in}}$ drives volume increase; via $dV=C\\,dP$, luminal pressure $P$ rises, and by $T=\\frac{P\\,r}{2}$ the wall stress expands the gland until stromal counterpressure develops. Sustained circumferential strain induces fibroblast activation and collagen deposition in a thin rim, reducing local water content. On ultrasound, the lesion appears well-circumscribed and anechoic with posterior acoustic enhancement, often with a thin hypoechoic rim due to compressed or fibrous stroma. On MRI, the cyst lumen is $T_2$ hyperintense and usually $T_1$ hypointense unless protein-rich, the fibrous rim is $T_2$ hypointense, and ADC is high in simple fluid.**\n- This option correctly follows the entire logical chain derived from the first principles.\n    - The biophysical mechanism of expansion ($\\frac{dV}{dt} > 0$, rising $P$ and $T$) is correct.\n    - The stromal response (fibrosis) is correct.\n    - The ultrasound findings (anechoic, posterior enhancement) are correct.\n    - The MRI findings ($T_2$ hyperintense lumen, $T_2$ hypointense rim, and high ADC) are correct.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Obstruction converts secretions into a uniformly solid mucin mass, so volume does not rise and $P$ remains constant; ultrasound shows a homogeneously hyperechoic solid nodule with posterior acoustic shadowing, while MRI demonstrates global $T_2$ hypointensity and marked diffusion restriction due to protein content.**\n- This option contradicts the provided principles. $\\frac{dV}{dt} = Q_{\\text{in}} > 0$ means volume *must* rise. A hyperechoic nodule with shadowing is the opposite of the expected anechoic lesion with enhancement. Global $T_2$ hypointensity is characteristic of dense fibrosis, not a fluid-filled cyst.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Pressure elevation directly triggers neoplastic epithelial proliferation rather than cystic dilatation, forming a solid adenoma; ultrasound reveals a vascular solid mass on Doppler with no posterior enhancement, and MRI shows global $T_2$ hypointensity and low ADC typical of high-cellularity tumors.**\n- This option introduces a biological pathway (neoplasia) that is not a direct consequence of the given biophysical principles. The primary result of obstruction is retention and dilatation. The imaging findings described are for a solid, high-cellularity tumor, not a simple retention cyst.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Expanding luminal pressure causes stromal edema that increases echogenicity so fluid-containing lesions produce posterior shadowing on ultrasound; on MRI, edema forms a $T_2$ hypointense rim around a universally $T_1$ hyperintense cystic core.**\n- This option contains multiple errors. The long-term stromal response is given as fibrosis (reduced water), not edema (increased water). Fluid-containing lesions cause posterior *enhancement*, not shadowing. Edema (water) is $T_2$ *hyperintense*, not hypointense. A fibrous rim would be hypointense, but it is not edema.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With $\\frac{dV}{dt}=Q_{\\text{in}}$ and $dV=C\\,dP$, pressure rises until rupture into the stroma is obligatory; while intact, ultrasound shows a hyperechoic lesion without enhancement, and MRI shows $T_2$ hypointense cyst contents due to water, with universally low ADC regardless of viscosity.**\n- This option makes an incorrect assertion (\"rupture...is obligatory\"). More importantly, it completely misstates the imaging physics. A fluid cyst is anechoic, not hyperechoic, and shows enhancement. Water is the reason for a $T_2$ *hyperintense* signal, not hypointense. ADC is high in free fluid and is dependent on viscosity, not universally low.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Therefore:\n$$dT_{r} \\approx 2T(t) \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{2}\\right) = T(t) d\\theta$$\nFor the ring to be in equilibrium, the outward and inward radial forces on the element must be equal:\n$$dF_{r} = dT_{r}$$\n$$\\frac{F}{2\\pi} d\\theta = T(t) d\\theta$$\nThis yields the relationship between the hoop tension $T(t)$ and the total applied traction $F$:\n$$T(t) = \\frac{F}{2\\pi}$$\nSince $F$ is a constant, the hoop tension $T$ is also constant for $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Step 2: Governing Differential Equation**\nThe problem provides the following relationships:\n- The hoop stress $\\sigma(t)$ is related to the hoop tension $T$ by $\\sigma(t) = \\frac{T}{A}$. Since $T$ and $A$ are constants, the stress $\\sigma = \\frac{F}{2\\pi A}$ is also constant for $t \\ge 0$.\n- The circumferential strain $\\varepsilon(t)$ is defined as $\\varepsilon(t) = \\frac{r(t) - r_0}{r_0}$.\n- The time derivative of the strain is $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{r(t) - r_0}{r_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r_0} \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n- The material obeys the Kelvin–Voigt constitutive law: $\\sigma(t) = E\\,\\varepsilon(t) + \\eta\\,\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}(t)$.\n\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\sigma$, $\\varepsilon$, and $\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}$ into the constitutive equation:\n$$\\frac{F}{2\\pi A} = E\\left(\\frac{r(t) - r_0}{r_0}\\right) + \\eta\\left(\\frac{1}{r_0} \\frac{dr}{dt}\\right)$$\nThis is the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $r(t)$. To solve it, we rearrange the equation into a standard form $\\frac{dy}{dx} + P(x)y = Q(x)$.\n$$\\frac{\\eta}{r_0} \\frac{dr}{dt} + \\frac{E}{r_0} r(t) = \\frac{F}{2\\pi A} + \\frac{E r_0}{r_0}$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{r_0}{\\eta}$:\n$$\\frac{dr}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta} r(t) = \\frac{r_0}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{F}{2\\pi A} + E\\right)$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients. Let $p = \\frac{E}{\\eta}$ and $q = \\frac{r_0}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{F}{2\\pi A} + E\\right)$. The equation is $\\frac{dr}{dt} + p\\,r = q$.\n\n**Step 3: Solution of the ODE**\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution $r_h(t)$ and a particular solution $r_p(t)$.\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dr_h}{dt} + \\frac{E}{\\eta} r_h = 0$, which has the solution:\n$$r_h(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{\\eta}t\\right)$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration.\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side $q$ is constant, we assume a constant particular solution $r_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the ODE:\n$$0 + \\frac{E}{\\eta} K = \\frac{r_0}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{F}{2\\pi A} + E\\right)$$\n$$K = \\frac{\\eta}{E} \\left[\\frac{r_0}{\\eta}\\left(\\frac{F}{2\\pi A} + E\\right)\\right] = r_0\\left(\\frac{F}{2\\pi AE} + 1\\right)$$\nThe general solution is $r(t) = r_h(t) + r_p(t)$:\n$$r(t) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E t}{\\eta}\\right) + r_0\\left(1 + \\frac{F}{2\\pi AE}\\right)$$\nNow we apply the initial condition $r(0) = r_0$ to find the constant $C$.\n$$r(0) = C \\exp(0) + r_0\\left(1 + \\frac{F}{2\\pi AE}\\right)$$\n$$r_0 = C + r_0 + \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE}$$\n$$C = - \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE}$$\nSubstituting the value of $C$ back into the general solution gives the final expression for $r(t)$:\n$$r(t) = - \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Et}{\\eta}\\right) + r_0\\left(1 + \\frac{F}{2\\pi AE}\\right)$$\nFactoring the expression to present it more clearly:\n$$r(t) = r_0 + \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE} - \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Et}{\\eta}\\right)$$\n$$r(t) = r_0 + \\frac{r_0 F}{2\\pi AE} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Et}{\\eta}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$r(t) = r_0 \\left[1 + \\frac{F}{2\\pi AE} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Et}{\\eta}\\right)\\right)\\right]$$\nThis expression describes the time-dependent radius of the cervical ring, starting at $r_0$ and exponentially approaching a final equilibrium radius of $r_0\\left(1 + \\frac{F}{2\\pi AE}\\right)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. This behavior is characteristic of the creep response of a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic solid under a constant load.",
