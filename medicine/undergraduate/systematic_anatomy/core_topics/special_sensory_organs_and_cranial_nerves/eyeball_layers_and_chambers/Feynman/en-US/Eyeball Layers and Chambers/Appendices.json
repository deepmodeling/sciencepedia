            "problem": "Anatomically, the outer fibrous layer of the eyeball comprises the cornea anteriorly and the sclera posteriorly. The anterior corneal surface forms the first dioptric interface of the optical system, where light transitions from air into the corneal tissue before reaching the anterior chamber. For a small, locally planar patch of the anterior cornea, assume an idealized interface between air and cornea and neglect the tear film and surface curvature over the region of interaction. A collimated light ray in air approaches the corneal surface with an incident angle of $30^{\\circ}$ measured from the surface normal. The refractive index of air is $n_{\\text{air}} = 1.0$, and the refractive index of the corneal stroma is $n_{\\text{cornea}} = 1.376$.\n\nStarting from the definition of refractive index $n = c/v$ (where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum and $v$ is the speed in the medium) and the principle that the optical path length $n \\times s$ is stationary (Fermat’s principle), use the interface refraction law that follows from these fundamentals to determine the angle of refraction $\\theta_{2}$ inside the cornea, measured from the surface normal.

            "solution": "The solution begins with the derivation of Snell's Law from Fermat's principle, as requested by the problem's framing. Fermat's principle states that the path taken by a light ray between two points is the path that can be traversed in the least time. This is equivalent to stating the optical path length (OPL) is stationary.\n\nLet the interface between air (medium 1, refractive index $n_1 = n_{\\text{air}}$) and the cornea (medium 2, refractive index $n_2 = n_{\\text{cornea}}$) be the x-axis. A light ray travels from a point $A(x_A, y_A)$ in medium 1 to a point $B(x_B, y_B)$ in medium 2, crossing the interface at an arbitrary point $P(x, 0)$. The OPL of this path is:\n$$ \\text{OPL}(x) = n_1 \\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2} + n_2 \\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2} $$\nTo find the path of stationary OPL, we take the derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d(\\text{OPL})}{dx} = n_1 \\frac{x - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} - n_2 \\frac{x_B - x}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2}} = 0 $$\nFrom the geometry, we can see that:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_1) = \\frac{x - x_A}{\\sqrt{(x - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{x_B - x}{\\sqrt{(x_B - x)^2 + y_B^2}} $$\nSubstituting these into the derivative equation gives Snell's Law:\n$$ n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) - n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) = 0 \\implies n_1 \\sin(\\theta_1) = n_2 \\sin(\\theta_2) $$\nThis law governs the refraction of light at the interface. We can now use it to solve for the angle of refraction, $\\theta_2$.\n\nThe given values are:\nRefractive index of air, $n_1 = 1.0$\nRefractive index of cornea, $n_2 = 1.376$\nAngle of incidence, $\\theta_1 = 30^{\\circ}$\n\nRearranging Snell's Law to solve for $\\sin(\\theta_2)$:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{n_1}{n_2} \\sin(\\theta_1) $$\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{1.0}{1.376} \\sin(30^{\\circ}) $$\nSince $\\sin(30^{\\circ}) = 0.5$, the equation becomes:\n$$ \\sin(\\theta_2) = \\frac{1.0 \\times 0.5}{1.376} = \\frac{0.5}{1.376} \\approx 0.363372 $$\nTo find the angle $\\theta_2$, we take the arcsin (inverse sine) of this value:\n$$ \\theta_2 = \\arcsin(0.363372) \\approx 21.3135^{\\circ} $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\theta_2 = 21.31^{\\circ} $$",

            "problem": "In the human eye, the aqueous humor is secreted by the ciliary processes into the posterior chamber, passes through the pupil into the anterior chamber, and drains primarily through the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal into the episcleral veins. The anterior chamber is bounded anteriorly by the cornea and posteriorly by the iris and lens, and its pressure, the intraocular pressure (IOP), reflects a steady-state balance between formation and outflow. Assume a linear outflow pathway where the outflow rate is proportional to the pressure difference between the IOP and the episcleral venous pressure. Let $F$ denote the aqueous humor formation rate, $C$ denote the outflow facility (proportionality constant of the outflow pathway), $P$ denote the IOP, and $P_{e}$ denote the episcleral venous pressure. At steady state, the mass balance requires that the inflow equals the outflow, and the proportional outflow relation defines the outflow rate in terms of $C$ and the trans-outflow pressure difference. Using only these fundamental statements, derive the IOP as a function of $F$, $C$, and $P_{e}$, then compute the net change in IOP, defined as $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{final}} - P_{\\text{initial}}$, when the formation rate decreases from $F_{\\text{initial}} = 2.5$ μL/min to $F_{\\text{final}} = 1.5$ μL/min, given an outflow facility $C = 0.25$ μL/min/mmHg and an episcleral venous pressure $P_{e} = 9$ mmHg.

The eyeball is considered a thin-walled spherical shell whose outer fibrous coat (sclera) is part of the fibrous tunic and encloses the inner vascular tunic (uvea) and neural tunic (retina). The posterior sclera forms the peripapillary region that anchors the lamina cribrosa at the optic nerve head. Intraocular pressure (IOP) applies a quasi-static, hydrostatic load to the inner surface of the globe.\n\nStarting from mechanical equilibrium of a thin-walled spherical shell with uniform thickness, derive the circumferential (hoop) stress in the sclera as a function of intraocular pressure $P$, globe radius $R$, and scleral thickness $t$.

This tension is not just a uniform stress in a perfect sphere; it has profound implications at the optic nerve head. The sclera has an opening, the scleral canal, which is bridged by the porous lamina cribrosa. The hoop stress in the peripapillary sclera surrounding this canal creates an outward radial pull on the walls of the canal. This force is transmitted to the lamina cribrosa, placing it under tension. Therefore, an increase in IOP directly leads to an increase in scleral hoop stress, which in turn increases the mechanical load and strain on the lamina cribrosa. This biomechanical pathway is central to the pathophysiology of glaucoma, where chronic, excessive strain on the lamina deforms its pores, compresses the traversing nerve fibers, and ultimately leads to their damage and death.",
