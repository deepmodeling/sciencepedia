The basilar membrane acts like a frequency spectrum analyzer, with different locations vibrating maximally to different frequencies. This exercise  invites you to derive this 'tonotopic map' from first principles, by modeling the membrane as a simple mass-spring system with properties that vary along its length. By working through this model, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how the physical structure of the inner ear directly gives rise to our perception of pitch.",

            "problem": "A simplified but anatomically grounded model of the human cochlea treats the basilar membrane (BM) as a position-dependent, locally resonant mechanical system. Empirically, the longitudinal stiffness of the BM decreases from base to apex, and across much of its length can be approximated by an exponential profile. Assume that at position $x$ (measured in $\\mathrm{mm}$ from the base toward the apex), the local transverse stiffness per unit area is $K(x)$ and the effective mass per unit area is $m$, which is approximately constant along $x$ over the region of interest. The local resonant frequency $f(x)$ at which the partition most efficiently vibrates is governed by the resonance of a mass–spring system. Numerous measurements support an exponential decay of stiffness with distance in the form $K(x)=K_{0}\\exp(-2\\alpha x)$, where $K_{0}$ and $\\alpha$ are positive constants, and $\\alpha$ characterizes the longitudinal gradient of BM stiffness. Let the characteristic (best) frequency at the base ($x=0$) be $f_{0}$.\n\nStarting only from these assumptions and the fundamental resonance relation for a mass–spring oscillator, derive an expression for the characteristic frequency map $f(x)$ in terms of $f_{0}$, $\\alpha$, and $x$, and then use it to calculate the predicted characteristic frequency at $x=12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for a cochlea with $f_{0}=20\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$ and $\\alpha=0.12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Characteristic Frequency Map $f(x)$**\n\nThe problem states that the local resonant frequency $f(x)$ of the basilar membrane is governed by the resonance of a mass–spring system. The resonant angular frequency, $\\omega$, of a simple harmonic oscillator with stiffness $k$ and mass $m$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\nThe frequency $f$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the resonant frequency is:\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}} $$\nIn this model, the relevant quantities are the stiffness per unit area, $K(x)$, and the mass per unit area, $m$. The same resonance relationship applies to these local densities. Thus, the local resonant frequency at position $x$ along the basilar membrane is:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K(x)}{m}} $$\nWe are given the explicit functional form for the stiffness:\n$$ K(x) = K_{0}\\exp(-2\\alpha x) $$\nwhere $K_{0}$ is the stiffness at the base ($x=0$), and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant describing the exponential decay rate. The mass per unit area, $m$, is assumed to be constant. Substituting the expression for $K(x)$ into the equation for $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}\\exp(-2\\alpha x)}{m}} $$\nWe can separate the terms inside the square root:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\sqrt{\\exp(-2\\alpha x)} $$\nThe square root of the exponential term simplifies as follows:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\exp(-2\\alpha x)} = \\left( \\exp(-2\\alpha x) \\right)^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\alpha x}{2}\\right) = \\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $f(x)$:\n$$ f(x) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nNow, we use the given condition for the characteristic frequency at the base, $f_{0}$, which corresponds to the frequency at $x=0$.\n$$ f_{0} = f(0) $$\nEvaluating our expression for $f(x)$ at $x=0$:\n$$ f(0) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot 0) = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} \\right) \\cdot 1 $$\nTherefore, the term in the parenthesis is equal to $f_{0}$:\n$$ f_{0} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{0}}{m}} $$\nSubstituting $f_{0}$ back into the general equation for $f(x)$, we obtain the desired expression for the characteristic frequency map:\n$$ f(x) = f_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha x) $$\nThis expression, often referred to as the Greenwood function, describes how the characteristic frequency decreases exponentially from the base to the apex of the cochlea.\n\n**Calculation of the Characteristic Frequency**\n\nNow, we use the derived formula to calculate the frequency at the specified position. We are given:\n- Position: $x = 12\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Base frequency: $f_{0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$\n- Decay constant: $\\alpha = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless exponent $\\alpha x$:\n$$ \\alpha x = (0.12\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{-1}) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{mm}) = 1.44 $$\nNow substitute the values into the frequency map equation. Since $f_{0}$ is in $\\mathrm{kHz}$, the resulting $f(x)$ will also be in $\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n$$ f(12) = 20 \\cdot \\exp(-1.44) $$\nWe calculate the value of the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp(-1.44) \\approx 0.2369277688 $$\nThen, we multiply by the base frequency:\n$$ f(12) \\approx 20 \\times 0.2369277688 \\approx 4.738555376\\,\\mathrm{kHz} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The first three significant digits are $4$, $7$, and $3$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third digit.\n$$ f(12) \\approx 4.74\\,\\mathrm{kHz} $$",

            "introduction": "Beyond hearing, the inner ear is also the seat of our sense of balance and spatial orientation. The otolith organs—the utricle and saccule—act as biological accelerometers, detecting both linear motion and the constant pull of gravity.

            "problem": "A healthy adult stands upright with the head in the anatomical position. The otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule) sense linear acceleration, including the constant gravitational acceleration $\\vec{g}$ of magnitude approximately $9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$. Hair cells in both maculae depolarize when stereocilia are deflected toward the kinocilium and hyperpolarize when deflected away. The macular polarity map is organized around the curved central striola: in the utricle, kinocilia are oriented toward the striola; in the saccule, kinocilia are oriented away from the striola. In the upright head, the utricular macula lies approximately in a horizontal plane, whereas the saccular macula lies approximately in a vertical parasagittal plane. Consider a slow, controlled forward head pitch of $15^\\circ$ that is then held steady for several seconds, with no linear translation of the body.

Predominant increase in firing from anterior utricular hemi-macula afferents (with concomitant decrease in posterior utricular hemi-macula), accompanied by increased firing in inferior saccular hemi-macula; net effect conveyed mainly by the inferior division of the vestibular nerve.",
            "solution": "This problem requires a step-by-step deduction based on the anatomy and physiology of the otolith organs.\n\n**1. Scientific Grounding and Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically valid and well-posed. It accurately describes:\n- The anatomical orientation of the utricular (horizontal) and saccular (vertical) maculae in the upright head.\n- The correct mechanism of hair cell transduction (deflection towards kinocilium is excitatory).\n- The established morphological polarity map of the utricle (kinocilia point toward the striola) and saccule (kinocilia point away from the striola).\n- The physical principle that a maintained head tilt relative to gravity induces a shear force on the otolithic membrane.\nThe problem provides all necessary information to deduce the resulting pattern of neural activity.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Stimulus (Forward Head Pitch)**\n- **Initial State (Upright):** The gravitational vector $\\vec{g}$ is perpendicular to the horizontal utricular macula, resulting in no shear force and a baseline tonic firing rate. The same vector $\\vec{g}$ is parallel to the vertical saccular macula, creating a constant downward shear and a corresponding baseline firing pattern.\n- **Maneuver (Slow $15^\\circ$ Forward Pitch):** The head and its embedded otolith organs are tilted forward by an angle $\\theta = 15^\\circ$. We analyze the change in shear force on each macula relative to its baseline.\n    - **Utricular Macula:** The initially horizontal plane is now tilted. The gravitational vector $\\vec{g}$ now has a component parallel to the macular surface, creating a new shear force. This shear force is directed posteriorly (opposite the direction of pitch). The magnitude of the change in shear force is proportional to $g \\sin(\\theta) = g \\sin(15^\\circ) \\approx 0.259g$. This is a substantial change from the zero-shear baseline.\n    - **Saccular Macula:** The initially vertical plane is now tilted. The shear force component parallel to its surface changes from being proportional to $g \\cos(0^\\circ) = g$ to $g \\cos(15^\\circ) \\approx 0.966g$. The *change* in shear force magnitude is therefore proportional to $g(1 - \\cos(15^\\circ)) \\approx 0.034g$. This is a very small change compared to the stimulus change experienced by the utricle.\n- **Conclusion:** The maneuver predominantly stimulates the utricle, while causing minimal change in the saccule's activation state.\n\n**3. Applying the Polarity Map to the Utricle**\n- The stimulus on the utricle is a **posteriorly directed shear force**.\n- The problem states that in the utricle, hair cell kinocilia are oriented **toward** the central striola. This means that cells in the posterior part of the macula have their kinocilia oriented posteriorly, while cells in the anterior part have their kinocilia oriented anteriorly.\n- A posterior shear force will deflect the stereocilia of the posterior hair cells **toward** their kinocilia, causing **depolarization** and an **increase** in afferent firing rate.\n- The same posterior shear force will deflect the stereocilia of the anterior hair cells **away** from their kinocilia, causing **hyperpolarization** and a **decrease** in afferent firing rate.\n- Therefore, the predicted pattern for the utricle is an increased firing from the posterior hemi-macula and a decreased firing from the anterior hemi-macula.\n\n**4. Considering Neural Innervation**\n- The vestibular nerve has two main divisions: superior and inferior.\n- The **superior division** innervates the utricle, the horizontal semicircular canal, and the anterior semicircular canal.\n- The **inferior division** innervates the saccule and the posterior semicircular canal.\n- Since the dominant response originates from the utricle, the net effect will be conveyed primarily by the **superior division of the vestibular nerve**.\n\n**5. Evaluating the Options**\n- **A:** States a predominant increase in posterior utricular firing, decrease in anterior utricular firing, minimal change in saccular afferents, and signal conveyed by the superior division. This perfectly matches our deduction.\n- **B:** Incorrectly identifies the saccule as the predominant responder and the inferior division as the main pathway.\n- **C:** Incorrectly claims equal activation and ignores the crucial role of polarity.\n- **D:** Incorrectly reverses the utricular activation pattern (claims anterior increase) and misidentifies the neural pathway.\n\nBased on this detailed analysis, option A is the only one consistent with the known anatomy and physiology of the vestibular system.",
