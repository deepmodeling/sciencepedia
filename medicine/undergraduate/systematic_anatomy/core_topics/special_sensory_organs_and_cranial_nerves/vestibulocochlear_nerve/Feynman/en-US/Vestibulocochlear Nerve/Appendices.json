These remarkable cells perform mechanotransduction, converting the physical vibration of sound into an electrical signal the brain can interpret. This practice  challenges you to quantify this process by calculating the change in ion current flowing into a hair cell in response to a precise mechanical stimulus, providing a concrete look at the biophysical foundation of hearing.",

            "problem": "An inner hair cell of the cochlear division of the Vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) transduces mechanical deflections of its stereocilia into ionic current through mechanotransduction (MET) channels located at the stereociliary tips. Consider a small deflection of the stereocilia, for which the open probability of the MET channels changes approximately linearly with displacement. The endolymph bathing the stereocilia has an endocochlear potential of $+80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ relative to perilymph, and the hair cell intracellular potential is $-45\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ relative to perilymph. Assume the driving voltage across the MET channels equals the difference between the endolymph potential and the intracellular potential.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the change in receptor current in an inner hair cell following a specified mechanical deflection. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The provided physiological values are standard and consistent.\n\nThe total ionic current, $I$, flowing through the population of mechanotransduction (MET) channels can be modeled as the product of the total number of channels, $N_{ch}$, the probability that a single channel is open, $P_o$, and the current flowing through a single open channel, $i_{ch}$.\n$$I = N_{ch} \\cdot P_o \\cdot i_{ch}$$\nThe single-channel current, $i_{ch}$, is determined by the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$, and the electrochemical driving voltage across the channel, $V_{driving}$, according to Ohm's law:\n$$i_{ch} = \\gamma \\cdot V_{driving}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total current gives:\n$$I = N_{ch} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot V_{driving} \\cdot P_o$$\nWe are asked to find the change in current, $\\Delta I$, resulting from a stimulus. Since $N_{ch}$, $\\gamma$, and $V_{driving}$ are constants for a given state of the system, the change in current is solely due to the change in open probability, $\\Delta P_o$:\n$$\\Delta I = N_{ch} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot V_{driving} \\cdot \\Delta P_o$$\nWe proceed by calculating the terms on the right-hand side.\n\nFirst, we determine the driving voltage, $V_{driving}$. This is the difference between the endocochlear potential, $V_{endo}$, and the intracellular potential of the hair cell, $V_{cell}$, both given relative to the perilymph.\n$$V_{driving} = V_{endo} - V_{cell}$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$V_{endo} = +80\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{cell} = -45\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -45 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{driving} = (80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) - (-45 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 125 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the change in open probability, $\\Delta P_o$. The problem states that for small deflections, the change in open probability is approximately linear with the displacement of the stereocilia, $\\Delta x$. The sensitivity, or change in open probability per unit displacement, is given as $k_p = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.

            "introduction": "Once a sensory hair cell generates a neural signal, that signal must travel swiftly and faithfully along the auditory division of the vestibulocochlear nerve to the brainstem. Clinicians can measure the timing of this transmission to diagnose neurological problems, such as a lesion or tumor compressing the nerve.

            "problem": "An advanced undergraduate is studying the auditory brainstem response (ABR) to localize lesions along the auditory pathway carried by the vestibulocochlear nerve. The widely accepted physiological bases are that ABR waves arise from serially ordered neural generators (wave I from the distal cochlear division of the vestibulocochlear nerve, wave III from lower pontine relays such as the superior olivary complex, and wave V from rostral brainstem pathways such as the lateral lemniscus and inferior colliculus), and that conduction times across serial segments add linearly. Consequently, for interpeak latencies, the latency between wave I and wave V equals the sum of the latencies between wave I and wave III and between wave III and wave V.\n\nA patient’s ABR, compared to age-matched normative values, shows an interpeak latency prolongation of wave I–III by $0.5$ milliseconds and wave I–V by $1.2$ milliseconds. Using only the definitional additivity of serial conduction times, compute the prolongation attributable to the wave III–V segment that would be most indicative of retrocochlear brainstem involvement.\n\nExpress your final answer in milliseconds and round your answer to two significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical neurophysiology, specifically the interpretation of auditory brainstem response (ABR), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language.\n\nThe core principle provided is that the conduction times across serial segments of the auditory pathway add linearly. This can be expressed as an equation for the interpeak latencies (IPL). Let $L_I$, $L_{III}$, and $L_V$ represent the absolute latencies of waves I, III, and V, respectively. The interpeak latencies are defined as:\n$$IPL_{I-III} = L_{III} - L_I$$\n$$IPL_{III-V} = L_V - L_{III}$$\n$$IPL_{I-V} = L_V - L_I$$\n\nThe problem states the additive relationship:\n$$IPL_{I-V} = IPL_{I-III} + IPL_{III-V}$$\nThis is an identity, as substituting the definitions confirms: $(L_V - L_I) = (L_{III} - L_I) + (L_V - L_{III})$.\n\nThe problem is concerned with the prolongation of these latencies in a patient compared to normative values. Let $\\Delta(X)$ represent the prolongation of a quantity $X$, which is the patient's value minus the normative value. The given data are:\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{I-III}) = 0.5 \\text{ ms} $$\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{I-V}) = 1.2 \\text{ ms} $$\n\nWe are asked to compute the prolongation of the wave III–V segment, which is $\\Delta(IPL_{III-V})$.\n\nSince the fundamental relationship $IPL_{I-V} = IPL_{I-III} + IPL_{III-V}$ holds for both the patient and the normative data, we can apply the prolongation operator $\\Delta$ to the entire equation. The $\\Delta$ operator, being a difference, is a linear operator. Therefore, it distributes over the sum:\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{I-V}) = \\Delta(IPL_{I-III} + IPL_{III-V}) $$\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{I-V}) = \\Delta(IPL_{I-III}) + \\Delta(IPL_{III-V}) $$\n\nWe need to solve for $\\Delta(IPL_{III-V})$. Rearranging the equation algebraically gives:\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{III-V}) = \\Delta(IPL_{I-V}) - \\Delta(IPL_{I-III}) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this equation:\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{III-V}) = 1.2 \\text{ ms} - 0.5 \\text{ ms} $$\n$$ \\Delta(IPL_{III-V}) = 0.7 \\text{ ms} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The calculated value, $0.7$, has one significant figure. To express this value with two significant figures, we must include a trailing zero. Therefore, the value is $0.70$.",

From there, signals propagate through the medial longitudinal fasciculus to ocular motor nuclei to drive compensatory eye movements. The cerebellar flocculus and paraflocculus modulate the reflex gain through Purkinje cell outputs onto vestibular nuclei, providing adaptive control.\n\nAssume small-angle, near-linear operation of the reflex such that the reflex gain $G$ is defined as the dimensionless ratio of the slow-phase eye angular velocity $V_{s}$ to the head angular velocity $\\omega$ during steady sinusoidal yaw head rotation.
