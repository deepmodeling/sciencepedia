Treating blood as a Newtonian fluid is a standard and valid approximation for flow in large arteries where shear rates are high. The concepts of vasoconstriction (reduction in vessel radius), perfusion pressure, and hydrodynamic resistance are cornerstone principles of cardiovascular physiology. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear physical model, a governing equation, and a specific change in one parameter ($r$).

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires an analysis based on the principles of laminar flow in a rigid cylinder, as described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for a steady, laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid with dynamic viscosity $\\eta$ through a cylindrical pipe of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure difference $\\Delta P$, is given by:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis equation establishes the relationship between flow rate and the physical parameters of the system. We are asked to determine how $Q$ scales with the radius $r$. Assuming $\\Delta P$, $\\eta$, and $L$ are constant, we can express this relationship as a proportionality:\n$$Q \\propto r^4$$\nThis indicates that the volumetric flow rate is extremely sensitive to changes in the vessel radius, scaling with the fourth power of the radius.\n\nNext, we consider the hydrodynamic resistance, $R$, which is defined in the problem statement as:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{Q}$$\nTo find the expression for $R$ in terms of the system's geometric and fluid properties, we substitute the Poiseuille equation for $Q$ into this definition:\n$$R = \\frac{\\Delta P}{\\left(\\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}\\right)} = \\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r^4}$$\nFrom this expression, we can determine the scaling of resistance $R$ with the radius $r$. Assuming $\\eta$ and $L$ are constant, the proportionality is:\n$$R \\propto \\frac{1}{r^4} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad R \\propto r^{-4}$$\nThis shows that hydrodynamic resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius.\n\nNow, we can calculate the multiplicative change factors for $R$ and $Q$ given the vasoconstrictive stimulus. Let the initial state be denoted by the subscript 'old' and the final state by 'new'. We are given:\n$$r_{\\text{new}} = 0.8 \\, r_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{4}{5} \\, r_{\\text{old}}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the change factor for resistance, $R_{\\text{new}}/R_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{new}}^4}}{\\frac{8 \\eta L}{\\pi r_{\\text{old}}^4}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{old}}^4}{r_{\\text{new}}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{old}}}{r_{\\text{new}}}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the given relationship between $r_{\\text{new}}$ and $r_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{old}}}{0.8 \\, r_{\\text{old}}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{0.8}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{4/5}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4$$\nCalculating the exact value:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\text{new}}}{R_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{5^4}{4^4} = \\frac{625}{256}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the change factor for volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{new}}/Q_{\\text{old}}$. The problem states that the perfusion pressure $\\Delta P$ is constant.\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_{\\text{new}}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_{\\text{old}}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}} = \\frac{r_{\\text{new}}^4}{r_{\\text{old}}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{new}}}{r_{\\text{old}}}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the given relationship:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}} = \\left(\\frac{0.8 \\, r_{\\text{old}}}{r_{\\text{old}}}\\right)^4 = (0.8)^4 = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4$$\nCalculating the exact value:\n$$\\frac{Q_{\\text{new}}}{Q_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{4^4}{5^4} = \\frac{256}{625}$$\n\nThus, a $20\\%$ reduction in the arterial radius leads to a significant increase in resistance (by a factor of approximately $2.44$) and a drastic decrease in blood flow (to approximately $41\\%$ of its original value). This demonstrates the profound impact of vessel diameter on perfusion, a critical concept in physiological regulation. The two ratios are reciprocals, which is expected since $Q = \\Delta P/R$ and $\\Delta P$ is constant, implying $Q_{\\text{new}}/Q_{\\text{old}} = (R_{\\text{new}}/R_{\\text{old}})^{-1}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the two calculated ratios, formatted as a row matrix.",

All necessary parameters are provided, the values are physiologically plausible, and the problem is well-posed, leading to a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe process of glomerular filtration involves the movement of fluid from the glomerular capillaries into Bowman's space. This movement is governed by the balance of hydrostatic and colloid osmotic (oncotic) pressures across the glomerular filtration barrier. This relationship is described by the Starling equation, which can be adapted for the glomerulus.\n\nThe net filtration pressure, denoted as $P_{\\text{net}}$ or NFP, is the difference between the forces favoring filtration and the forces opposing it.\n\nForces favoring filtration are:\n1.  The glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure ($P_G$), which is the blood pressure within the glomerular capillaries. This force pushes fluid out of the capillaries.\n2.  The colloid osmotic pressure of the fluid in Bowman's space ($\\pi_B$). This pressure would pull fluid out of the capillaries, but it is typically negligible because the glomerular barrier is nearly impermeable to proteins under normal physiological conditions.\n\nForces opposing filtration (favoring reabsorption) are:\n1.  The hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space ($P_B$), which is the fluid pressure in the space surrounding the capillaries. This force pushes fluid back into the capillaries.\n2.  The colloid osmotic pressure of the blood plasma within the glomerular capillaries ($\\pi_G$).

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem can be modeled as a simple series resistance circuit. The afferent arteriole (resistance $R_A$) and the efferent arteriole (resistance $R_E$) are two resistors in series. The total pressure drop across this system is from the renal artery to the renal vein, $\\Delta P_{total} = P_A - P_V$.\n\nThe glomerular hydrostatic pressure, $P_G$, is the pressure at the node between these two resistors. The assumption that the intrinsic resistance of the glomerular capillaries is negligible justifies treating the glomerulus as a single point or node in the circuit with a uniform pressure $P_G$.\n\nSince the resistors are in series, the flow, $Q$, is the same through both. We can express the flow in two ways:\n$1$. Across the afferent arteriole: $Q = \\frac{P_A - P_G}{R_A}$\n$2$. Across the efferent arteriole: $Q = \\frac{P_G - P_V}{R_E}$\n\nThis model applies to any steady state. We are asked to find the new glomerular pressure after a change in resistance. Let the new afferent resistance be $R'_A$ and the new efferent resistance be $R'_E$. The new glomerular pressure, which the problem statement asks us to denote as $P_G$, is determined by the same physical principles.\n\nThe afferent resistance rises by $30$ percent:\n$$R'_A = R_A + 0.30 R_A = 1.3 R_A$$\nThe efferent resistance remains unchanged:\n$$R'_E = R_E$$\n\nUnder these new conditions, the flow $Q'$ through the new resistances is given by:\n$$Q' = \\frac{P_A - P_G}{R'_A} = \\frac{P_G - P_V}{R'_E}$$\nTo solve for the new $P_G$, we equate the flow expressions:\n$$\\frac{P_A - P_G}{1.3 R_A} = \\frac{P_G - P_V}{R_E}$$\nTo solve for $P_G$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$R_E (P_A - P_G) = 1.3 R_A (P_G - P_V)$$\n$$R_E P_A - R_E P_G = 1.3 R_A P_G - 1.3 R_A P_V$$\nGroup the terms containing $P_G$:\n$$R_E P_A + 1.3 R_A P_V = P_G (1.3 R_A + R_E)$$\nIsolating $P_G$ yields the analytic expression in terms of the baseline resistances $R_A$ and $R_E$ and the boundary pressures $P_A$ and $P_V$:\n$$P_G = \\frac{R_E P_A + 1.3 R_A P_V}{1.3 R_A + R_E}$$\nThis is the general expression for the new glomerular hydrostatic pressure. The problem requires substituting the given numerical values for $P_A$ and $P_V$.\nGiven $P_A = 100$ mmHg and $P_V = 10$ mmHg:\n$$P_G = \\frac{R_E (100) + 1.3 R_A (10)}{1.3 R_A + R_E}$$\nSimplifying the numerical coefficients gives the final expression for $P_G$ in millimeters of mercury (mmHg):\n$$P_G = \\frac{100 R_E + 13 R_A}{1.3 R_A + R_E}$$\nSince the baseline resistance values $R_A$ and $R_E$ (or their ratio) are not provided, a single numerical value for $P_G$ cannot be determined. The problem asks for the analytic expression in terms of $R_A$ and $R_E$, which has been derived. This is the final form of the answer.",
