            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid application of fundamental principles of fluid mechanics to a biophysical system. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. I will therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation as requested.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for a steady, fully developed laminar flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid through a rigid cylindrical conduit of radius $r$ and length $L$, driven by a pressure drop $\\Delta P$. The derivation must begin from a radial force balance.\n\nLet the cylindrical coordinate system be $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, with the $z$-axis aligned with the cylinder's central axis. The flow is in the positive $z$-direction. Due to the axial symmetry and fully developed nature of the flow, the axial velocity $u_z$ is a function of the radial coordinate $\\rho$ only, i.e., $u_z = u_z(\\rho)$.\n\nFirst, consider a cylindrical fluid element of radius $\\rho$ (where $0 \\le \\rho \\le r$) and length $L$. For steady flow, the net force on this element must be zero. The forces acting in the $z$-direction are the pressure forces on the two circular faces and the viscous shear force on the cylindrical surface.\n\nThe pressure force, $F_P$, is the difference between the force on the face at $z=0$ and the face at $z=L$.\n$$ F_P = P(0) \\cdot \\pi\\rho^2 - P(L) \\cdot \\pi\\rho^2 = (P(0) - P(L))\\pi\\rho^2 $$\nWe define the pressure drop over the length $L$ as $\\Delta P = P(0) - P(L)$. For a steady flow, the pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is constant and can be written as $-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\nThus, the pressure force is $F_P = \\Delta P \\pi\\rho^2$.\n\nThe viscous shear force, $F_S$, acts on the surface area $A_S = 2\\pi\\rho L$ of the fluid cylinder. The shear stress, $\\tau_{\\rho z}$, is the $z$-component of force acting on a surface with its normal in the $\\rho$-direction. This stress is exerted by the fluid at radial position $\\rho_2 > \\rho$ on the fluid at $\\rho_1 < \\rho$. It opposes the motion of the inner fluid cylinder relative to the outer fluid layers. The total shear force is $F_S = \\tau_{\\rho z} \\cdot (2\\pi\\rho L)$.\n\nThe force balance in the $z$-direction requires the sum of all forces to be zero:\n$$ \\sum F_z = F_P + F_S = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta P \\pi\\rho^2 + \\tau_{\\rho z} (2\\pi\\rho L) = 0 $$\nSolving for the shear stress $\\tau_{\\rho z}$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\rho z} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nThis equation shows that the shear stress is a linear function of the radial position, being zero at the centerline ($\\rho=0$) and maximum at the wall ($\\rho=r$).\n\nNext, we use the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid, which states that shear stress is proportional to the rate of shear strain (the velocity gradient). For this geometry, the relation is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\rho z} = \\eta \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho} $$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nEquating the two expressions for $\\tau_{\\rho z}$:\n$$ \\eta \\frac{du_z}{d\\rho} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2L} \\rho $$\nTo find the velocity profile $u_z(\\rho)$, we separate variables and integrate with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$ du_z = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ \\int du_z = \\int -\\frac{\\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\rho \\, d\\rho $$\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} \\rho^2 + C $$\nThe integration constant $C$ is determined by the no-slip boundary condition at the cylinder wall, which states that the fluid velocity is zero at the wall, i.e., $u_z(r) = 0$.\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} r^2 + C \\implies C = \\frac{\\Delta P r^2}{4\\eta L} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C$ back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u_z(\\rho) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (r^2 - \\rho^2) $$\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is found by integrating this velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the pipe. The differential area element is an annulus of radius $\\rho$ and thickness $d\\rho$, so $dA = 2\\pi\\rho \\, d\\rho$.\n$$ Q = \\int_A u_z(\\rho) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{r} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\eta L} (r^2 - \\rho^2) \\right) (2\\pi\\rho) \\, d\\rho $$\nWe can take the constant terms outside the integral:\n$$ Q = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\eta L} \\int_{0}^{r} (r^2\\rho - \\rho^3) \\, d\\rho = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\int_{0}^{r} (r^2\\rho - \\rho^3) \\, d\\rho $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left[ \\frac{r^2\\rho^2}{2} - \\frac{\\rho^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{r} $$\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\left(\\frac{r^2 \\cdot r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4}\\right) - (0 - 0) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\eta L} \\left( \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right) $$\nThis yields the Hagen-Poiseuille equation for volumetric flow rate:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r^4}{8 \\eta L} $$\nThis is the required analytic expression for $Q$ as a function of $\\Delta P$, $r$, $\\eta$, and $L$.\n\nNow, we use this expression to calculate the numerical values requested.\nFirst, we compute the baseline volumetric flow rate, $Q_{\\text{baseline}}$.

The fractional decrease is defined as $(Q_{\\text{baseline}} - Q_{\\text{spasm}})/Q_{\\text{baseline}}$.\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{baseline}} - Q_{\\text{spasm}}}{Q_{\\text{baseline}}} = 1 - \\frac{Q_{\\text{spasm}}}{Q_{\\text{baseline}}} $$\nSince $Q$ is directly proportional to $r^4$ and all other parameters are constant, the ratio of flow rates is:\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{spasm}}}{Q_{\\text{baseline}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{\\text{spasm}}^4}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_{\\text{baseline}}^4}{8 \\eta L}} = \\left(\\frac{r_{\\text{spasm}}}{r_{\\text{baseline}}}\\right)^4 $$\nThe ratio of radii is $\\frac{0.8 \\text{ mm}}{1.0 \\text{ mm}} = 0.8$.\n$$ \\frac{Q_{\\text{spasm}}}{Q_{\\text{baseline}}} = (0.8)^4 = 0.4096 $$\nThe fractional decrease is therefore:\n$$ 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904 $$\nThis result has four significant figures.\n\nThe two quantities to be reported are the baseline flow rate, $Q_{\\text{baseline}} = 1.122 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ m}^3\\text{s}^{-1}$, and the fractional decrease, $0.5904$.",

            "problem": "A $68$-year-old patient with transient neurologic symptoms undergoes duplex Doppler ultrasound of the carotid bifurcation. Angle-corrected peak systolic velocities (PSV) are recorded in the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) as follows: proximal, pre-stenotic ICA PSV $v_{0} = 88$ cm/s; at the tightest stenotic segment ICA PSV $v_{s} = 352$ cm/s. The ipsilateral Common Carotid Artery (CCA) PSV is $v_{\\text{CCA}} = 72$ cm/s. Assume a short, focal lesion with laminar flow during systole, negligible viscosity, and conservation of volumetric flow rate $Q$ across the lesion during the instant of peak systole, with the vessel cross-section approximated as circular. Use these hemodynamic assumptions to compute the area stenosis fraction $\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}}$ in the ICA, where $A_{0}$ is the cross-sectional area of the pre-stenotic segment and $A_{s}$ is the cross-sectional area at the stenosis. Express the final answer as a dimensionless decimal fraction without a percentage sign, and round your answer to four significant figures.\n\nIn your reasoning, you may also consider well-tested clinical Doppler criteria for suspicion of significant ICA stenosis, such as ICA peak systolic velocity exceeding $125$ cm/s suggesting greater than $0.50$ diameter stenosis and exceeding $230$ cm/s suggesting greater than $0.70$ diameter stenosis, and an ICA-to-CCA PSV ratio greater than $4$ suggesting greater than $0.70$ diameter stenosis. Based on your computed result and these accepted thresholds, propose an appropriate confirmatory imaging modality in your solution. The final numeric answer must be only the computed area stenosis fraction $\\alpha$.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid. The provided values are physiologically plausible for the described clinical scenario. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to compute the requested quantity based on the stated assumptions.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be applied is the conservation of volumetric flow rate, $Q$, for an incompressible fluid flowing through a tube of varying cross-sectional area. The problem specifies that we should assume conservation of $Q$ across the stenotic lesion at the instant of peak systole. The volumetric flow rate is given by the product of the cross-sectional area, $A$, and the average fluid velocity, $v$, perpendicular to that area.\n\nLet the subscript $0$ denote the pre-stenotic segment of the Internal Carotid Artery (ICA) and the subscript $s$ denote the segment at the point of maximum stenosis. The given variables are the peak systolic velocities (PSV) in these segments: $v_{0} = 88 \\text{ cm/s}$ and $v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$. The cross-sectional areas are $A_{0}$ and $A_{s}$, respectively.\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass, simplified as the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid, states that the volumetric flow rate must be constant along the vessel.\n$$Q_{0} = Q_{s}$$\nSubstituting the expression for flow rate, $Q = A \\cdot v$, we have:\n$$A_{0} v_{0} = A_{s} v_{s}$$\nThis equation relates the areas and velocities in the two segments. The problem asks for the area stenosis fraction, $\\alpha$, which is defined as:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}}$$\nTo compute $\\alpha$, we first need to find the ratio of the areas, $\\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}}$. We can rearrange the continuity equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\\frac{A_{s}}{A_{0}} = \\frac{v_{0}}{v_{s}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression back into the definition of the area stenosis fraction $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{v_{0}}{v_{s}}$$\nUsing the provided numerical values for the velocities:\n$$v_{0} = 88 \\text{ cm/s}$$\n$$v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$$\nWe can calculate the value of $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - \\frac{88}{352}$$\nThe ratio of the velocities is:\n$$\\frac{88}{352} = \\frac{88}{4 \\times 88} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\nTherefore, the area stenosis fraction is:\n$$\\alpha = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, we express the result as $0.7500$. This value corresponds to a $75\\%$ reduction in the cross-sectional area of the artery at the site of the stenosis.\n\nFor completeness, we consider the additional clinical context provided. The stenotic peak systolic velocity is $v_{s} = 352 \\text{ cm/s}$, which is significantly greater than the widely accepted threshold of $230 \\text{ cm/s}$ used to suggest a hemodynamically severe stenosis (often correlated with a diameter stenosis greater than $0.70$).\n\nFurthermore, we can calculate the ICA-to-CCA PSV ratio:\n$$\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{v_{s}}{v_{\\text{CCA}}} = \\frac{352 \\text{ cm/s}}{72 \\text{ cm/s}} \\approx 4.889$$\nThis ratio is substantially greater than the threshold of $4.0$, which also strongly indicates a severe stenosis (greater than $0.70$ diameter stenosis).\n\nIt is important to note that the simplified continuity equation used for this calculation relates a $0.75$ area stenosis to a $0.50$ diameter stenosis (since $\\alpha = 1 - (1-\\delta)^2 \\implies \\delta = 1 - \\sqrt{1-\\alpha} = 1 - \\sqrt{1-0.75} = 0.5$, where $\\delta$ is diameter stenosis). This apparent discrepancy with the empirical Doppler criteria (which suggest a $>0.70$ diameter stenosis for these velocities) highlights the limitations of the ideal fluid model. The model neglects energy losses due to viscosity and turbulence, which are significant in high-grade stenosis and are implicitly accounted for in the empirically derived clinical velocity thresholds.\n\nGiven the strong suggestion of a high-grade, hemodynamically significant stenosis based on the duplex ultrasound findings (both absolute PSV and ICA/CCA ratio), a confirmatory imaging study is clinically warranted to provide precise anatomical detail for potential intervention (e.g., carotid endarterectomy or stenting). The most appropriate and commonly used non-invasive modality for this purpose is CT Angiography (CTA) of the neck. CTA provides excellent spatial resolution, allowing for accurate measurement of the stenosis, assessment of plaque morphology, and evaluation of the aortic arch and intracranial vessels.",

To the MCA territory (and then to the venous sink): $Q_{\\text{out,M}} = \\frac{P_M - P_v}{R_{\\text{tM}}} = \\frac{P_M}{R_{\\text{tM}}}$\n\nConservation of flow at node M implies:\n$$\\frac{P_L - P_M}{R_{\\text{LM}}'} + \\frac{P_B - P_M}{R_{\\text{PCom}}} = \\frac{P_M}{R_{\\text{tM}}}$$\nRearranging to solve for $P_M$:\n$$P_M = \\frac{\\frac{P_L}{R_{\\text{LM}}'} + \\frac{P_B}{R_{\\text{PCom}}}}{\\frac{1}{R_{\\text{LM}}'} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{PCom}}} + \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tM}}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$P_M = \\frac{\\frac{90}{9} + \\frac{85}{6}}{\\frac{1}{9} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{8}} = \\frac{10 + \\frac{85}{6}}{\\frac{8}{72} + \\frac{12}{72} + \\frac{9}{72}} = \\frac{\\frac{60+85}{6}}{\\frac{29}{72}} = \\frac{\\frac{145}{6}}{\\frac{29}{72}} = \\frac{145}{6} \\cdot \\frac{72}{29} = 5 \\cdot 12 = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\nThe post-stenosis flows into the ACA and MCA territories, denoted $Q_{\\text{ACA}}'$ and $Q_{\\text{MCA}}'$, are the flows through the terminal resistances $R_{\\text{tA}}$ and $R_{\\text{tM}}$, respectively.\n$$Q_{\\text{ACA}}' = \\frac{P_A}{R_{\\text{tA}}} = \\frac{5040/71}{12} = \\frac{420}{71} \\ \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{s}}$$\n$$Q_{\\text{MCA}}' = \\frac{P_M}{R_{\\text{tM}}} = \\frac{60}{8} = \\frac{15}{2} \\ \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{s}}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the required fraction $f_{\\text{ACA}}$:\n$$f_{\\text{ACA}} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{ACA}}'}{Q_{\\text{ACA}}' + Q_{\\text{MCA}}'} = \\frac{\\frac{420}{71}}{\\frac{420}{71} + \\frac{15}{2}}$$\nTo simplify, we find a common denominator for the sum in the denominator:\n$$f_{\\text{ACA}} = \\frac{\\frac{420}{71}}{\\frac{2 \\cdot 420 + 15 \\cdot 71}{2 \\cdot 71}} = \\frac{\\frac{420}{71}}{\\frac{840 + 1065}{142}} = \\frac{\\frac{420}{71}}{\\frac{1905}{142}}$$\n$$f_{\\text{ACA}} = \\frac{420}{71} \\cdot \\frac{142}{1905} = \\frac{420 \\cdot 2}{1905} = \\frac{840}{1905}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by $5$ and $3$, so they are divisible by $15$.\n$$f_{\\text{ACA}} = \\frac{840 \\div 15}{1905 \\div 15} = \\frac{56}{127}$$\nTo provide the final answer, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n$$f_{\\text{ACA}} = \\frac{56}{127} \\approx 0.44094488...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.4409$.",
