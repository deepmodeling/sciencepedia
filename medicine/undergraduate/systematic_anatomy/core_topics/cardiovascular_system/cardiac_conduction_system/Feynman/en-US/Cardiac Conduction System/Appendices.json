            "problem": "A surface Electrocardiogram (ECG) records the timing of electrical events driven by the cardiac conduction system. The PR interval is defined anatomically and physiologically as the time from the onset of atrial depolarization (the beginning of the P wave) to the onset of ventricular depolarization (the beginning of the QRS complex). In sequence, this interval encompasses intra-atrial conduction across the atrial myocardium, delay within the Atrioventricular (AV) node, and rapid conduction through the His bundle and Purkinje fibers to the earliest activating ventricular myocardium at the interventricular septum. \n\nIn an adult subject, separate compartmental measurements of conduction and delay are obtained: atrial conduction time $40\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, AV nodal delay $90\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and His–Purkinje conduction time to septal activation $30\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Based on the foundational definitions above and the sequential nature of these events, determine the PR interval. Express your final numerical answer in seconds, rounded to three significant figures. Then, using the widely accepted normal adult PR interval range of $120$ to $200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ at rest, assess whether the computed interval falls within the normal range. State any comparisons or interpretations in your reasoning, but provide only the computed PR interval as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The PR interval encompasses the sequential electrical events of atrial conduction, AV nodal delay, and His-Purkinje conduction. The total duration of a series of sequential events is their sum. Therefore, the PR interval, denoted as $T_{PR}$, can be calculated by summing the durations of its constituent parts.\n\nLet $T_{atrial}$ be the atrial conduction time, $T_{AV}$ be the AV nodal delay, and $T_{HP}$ be the His-Purkinje conduction time. The total PR interval is given by the equation:\n$$T_{PR} = T_{atrial} + T_{AV} + T_{HP}$$\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$T_{atrial} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$T_{AV} = 90\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n$$T_{HP} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe calculation in units of milliseconds is:\n$$T_{PR} = 40\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 90\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 30\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 160\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in seconds. The conversion from milliseconds to seconds is based on the relation $1\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$T_{PR} = 160\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{ms}} = 0.160\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe result, $0.160\\,\\mathrm{s}$, has three significant figures as required.\n\nAs an assessment based on the problem's prompt for interpretation, the calculated interval of $160\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ satisfies the condition $120\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\le 160\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\le 200\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.
