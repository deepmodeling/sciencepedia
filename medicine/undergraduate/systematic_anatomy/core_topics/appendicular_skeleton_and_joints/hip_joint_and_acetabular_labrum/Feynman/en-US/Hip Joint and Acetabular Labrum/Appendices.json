            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of anatomy and radiography, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The task is to calculate the Wiberg center-edge angle using vector analysis based on provided coordinates.\n\nLet the center of the femoral head be denoted by the point $H$ and the lateral acetabular rim by the point $R$. The coordinates are given as:\n$$ H = (x_{h}, y_{h}) = (40.0\\,\\text{mm}, 60.0\\,\\text{mm}) $$\n$$ R = (x_{r}, y_{r}) = (55.0\\,\\text{mm}, 80.0\\,\\text{mm}) $$\n\nThe center-edge angle is defined as the angle between two vectors originating from the femoral head center, $H$. Let's define these two vectors.\n\nThe first vector, let's call it $\\vec{u}$, is the vector from the femoral head center $H$ to the lateral acetabular rim $R$. It is calculated as the difference between the coordinates of $R$ and $H$:\n$$ \\vec{u} = R - H = (x_{r} - x_{h}, y_{r} - y_{h}) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\vec{u} = (55.0 - 40.0, 80.0 - 60.0) = (15.0, 20.0) $$\nThe units for the components of this vector are millimeters, but they will cancel out in the angle calculation.\n\nThe second vector, let's call it $\\vec{v}$, represents the superior vertical direction originating from $H$. In the given Cartesian coordinate system, the $y$-axis increases superiorly. Therefore, a vector pointing directly in the superior direction is any vector of the form $(0, k)$ where $k > 0$. The simplest such unit vector is:\n$$ \\vec{v} = (0, 1) $$\n\nThe angle $\\theta$ between two non-zero vectors $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$ can be determined using the dot product formula:\n$$ \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = ||\\vec{u}|| \\, ||\\vec{v}|| \\cos(\\theta) $$\nRearranging for $\\theta$, we get:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}}{||\\vec{u}|| \\, ||\\vec{v}||}\\right) $$\n\nWe now calculate the three components of this expression: the dot product $\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}$, and the magnitudes $||\\vec{u}||$ and $||\\vec{v}||$.\n\n1.  The dot product of $\\vec{u} = (15.0, 20.0)$ and $\\vec{v} = (0, 1)$:\n    $$ \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v} = (15.0)(0) + (20.0)(1) = 0 + 20.0 = 20.0 $$\n\n2.  The magnitude of vector $\\vec{u}$:\n    $$ ||\\vec{u}|| = \\sqrt{(15.0)^{2} + (20.0)^{2}} = \\sqrt{225.0 + 400.0} = \\sqrt{625.0} = 25.0 $$\n\n3.  The magnitude of vector $\\vec{v}$:\n    $$ ||\\vec{v}|| = \\sqrt{(0)^{2} + (1)^{2}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1 $$\n\nNow, substitute these values back into the formula for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{20.0}{25.0 \\times 1}\\right) = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{20.0}{25.0}\\right) = \\arccos(0.8) $$\n\nThe problem requires the angle to be expressed in degrees. We convert the result from radians to degrees:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{deg}} = \\arccos(0.8) \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} $$\nUsing a calculator, we find the value:\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{deg}} \\approx 36.8698976...^{\\circ} $$\n\nThe final step is to round the answer to four significant figures as requested.\n$$ \\theta_{\\text{deg}} \\approx 36.87^{\\circ} $$\nThis value is consistent with the clinically normal range for the Wiberg center-edge angle.",

            "problem": "An advanced-undergraduate anatomy student is analyzing how acetabular labral deepening alters load distribution across the hip joint.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Model: Right hip in single-leg stance.\n-   Femoral head geometry: Sphere of radius $R = 25\\,\\text{mm}$.\n-   Initial contact patch: Spherical cap with half-angle $\\varphi_{0} = 0.60\\,\\text{rad}$.\n-   Joint reaction force: Magnitude $F = 2400\\,\\text{N}$, acting approximately normal to the contact patch.\n-   Surgical modification: Labral deepening by $d = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$.\n-   Definition of deepening: Measured along the spherical articular surface at the rim.\n-   Effect of modification: Increases the cap half-angle.\n-   Post-modification geometry: Contact patch remains a spherical cap on the same sphere.\n-   Objective: Determine the new peak contact stress.\n-   Required output format: Megapascals (MPa), rounded to three significant figures.\n-   Constraint: Use only the definition of normal stress and first principles of differential geometry. Treat all angles in radians.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a well-defined application of solid mechanics and geometry to a simplified biomechanical model of the human hip joint.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The model utilizes standard simplifications (spherical joint, spherical cap contact area, uniform stress assumption) and physiologically reasonable parameters for a biomechanics problem. It adheres to fundamental principles of mechanics and geometry.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate the new contact area and the resulting stress. The relationship between the labral deepening and the change in contact angle is unambiguously defined by the geometry of the sphere. The question asks for a single numerical value.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language.\n\nThe term \"peak contact stress\" could imply a non-uniform stress distribution. However, the problem's constraint to use only first principles of stress and geometry, without providing a stress distribution model (e.g., Hertzian), strongly implies that a uniform stress distribution should be assumed. In this standard simplification, the peak stress is equal to the average stress. With this clarification, the problem is entirely self-contained and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the new contact stress on the femoral head after a surgical procedure increases the contact area.\n\n$1$. **Normal Stress Definition**: Mechanical stress, $\\sigma$, is defined as force per unit area. Since the force $F$ is stated to act normally to the contact patch of area $A$, the normal stress is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\nAs discussed in the validation, we assume the stress is uniformly distributed over the contact area. Therefore, the peak stress is equal to the average stress calculated by this formula.\n\n$2$. **Contact Area Geometry**: The contact patch is a spherical cap on a sphere of radius $R$. The area of a spherical cap is a standard result from differential geometry. For a cap defined by a half-angle $\\varphi$ (measured from the pole of the cap), its area $A$ is given by:\n$$\nA(\\varphi) = 2 \\pi R^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\varphi))\n$$\n\n$3$. **Determining the New Geometry**: The initial contact patch has a half-angle of $\\varphi_{0}$. The acetabular labrum is deepened by an amount $d = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$, described as \"coverage measured along the spherical articular surface\". This description corresponds to an arc length on the surface of the sphere. This added arc length increases the half-angle of the spherical cap. Let the new half-angle be $\\varphi_{\\text{new}}$.\n\nThe relationship between an arc length $s$ on a great circle of a sphere of radius $R$ and the angle $\\theta$ it subtends at the center is $s = R\\theta$. The deepening $d$ represents the additional arc length by which the contact patch extends from its original rim. This corresponds to an angular increase $\\Delta\\varphi$ such that:\n$$\nd = R (\\Delta\\varphi)\n$$\nTherefore, the change in angle is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\varphi = \\frac{d}{R}\n$$\nThe new half-angle of the contact patch is the sum of the original half-angle and this increment:\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\text{new}} = \\varphi_{0} + \\Delta\\varphi = \\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\n$$\n\n$4$. **Calculating the New Contact Stress**: We can now formulate an expression for the new stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$, by combining the equations above. The force $F$ is assumed to remain constant. The new area, $A_{\\text{new}}$, is calculated using the new angle, $\\varphi_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{new}} = 2 \\pi R^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\varphi_{\\text{new}})) = 2 \\pi R^{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe new stress is then:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{F}{A_{\\text{new}}} = \\frac{F}{2 \\pi R^{2} \\left(1 - \\cos\\left(\\varphi_{0} + \\frac{d}{R}\\right)\\right)}\n$$\n\n$5$. **Numerical Calculation**: We now substitute the given values. The final answer is requested in megapascals (MPa). We recognize that $1\\,\\text{MPa} = 10^{6}\\,\\text{Pa} = 10^{6}\\,\\text{N/m}^{2} = 1\\,\\text{N/mm}^{2}$. Using units of Newtons for force and millimeters for length will directly yield the stress in MPa.\n\nGiven:\n-   $F = 2400\\,\\text{N}$\n-   $R = 25\\,\\text{mm}$\n-   $\\varphi_{0} = 0.60\\,\\text{rad}$\n-   $d = 2.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nFirst, calculate the new half-angle $\\varphi_{\\text{new}}$ in radians:\n$$\n\\varphi_{\\text{new}} = 0.60\\,\\text{rad} + \\frac{2.0\\,\\text{mm}}{25\\,\\text{mm}} = 0.60\\,\\text{rad} + 0.08\\,\\text{rad} = 0.68\\,\\text{rad}\n$$\nNext, calculate the new contact area $A_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{new}} = 2 \\pi (25\\,\\text{mm})^{2} (1 - \\cos(0.68\\,\\text{rad}))\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\text{new}} = 2 \\pi (625\\,\\text{mm}^{2}) (1 - \\cos(0.68)) = 1250 \\pi (1 - \\cos(0.68))\\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the trigonometric function (with the angle in radians):\n$$\n\\cos(0.68) \\approx 0.777861\n$$\n$$\nA_{\\text{new}} \\approx 1250 \\pi (1 - 0.777861)\\,\\text{mm}^{2} \\approx 1250 \\pi (0.222139)\\,\\text{mm}^{2} \\approx 872.33\\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nFinally, calculate the new stress $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{2400\\,\\text{N}}{A_{\\text{new}}} \\approx \\frac{2400\\,\\text{N}}{872.33\\,\\text{mm}^{2}} \\approx 2.7512\\,\\text{N/mm}^{2}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{N/mm}^{2} = 1\\,\\text{MPa}$, the new stress is approximately $2.7512\\,\\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{new}} \\approx 2.75\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe labral deepening increased the contact area, thereby reducing the contact stress from its initial value.

            "problem": "A clinician evaluates two adult hips using standardized anteroposterior pelvis and cross-table lateral radiographs. The acetabular center-edge angle (CEA) is defined as the angle between a vertical line through the femoral head center and a line connecting the femoral head center to the lateral edge of the acetabular sourcil; it quantifies superolateral acetabular coverage of the femoral head. The alpha angle is defined on the radial plane about the femoral neck axis as the angle between a line from the femoral head center to the point where the head-neck contour first departs from a best-fit circle and a reference line along the femoral neck axis; it quantifies femoral head-neck asphericity. Use the following well-accepted thresholds: developmental dysplasia of the hip is suggested when $\\text{CEA} < 20^\\circ$, and a cam deformity is suggested when the alpha angle $> 55^\\circ$.\n\nAssume the following biomechanical principles and observations:\n- During single-leg stance in neutral hip position, the hip joint reaction force resultant passes through the femoral head center toward the superior load-bearing dome of the acetabulum, biasing contact toward the superolateral rim when osseous coverage is reduced. The acetabular labrum acts as a fibrocartilaginous ring that deepens the socket and resists rim-directed loads by hoop stress.\n- During deep hip flexion to approximately $90^\\circ$ with internal rotation of approximately $20^\\circ$, the anterosuperior femoral head-neck junction approaches the anterosuperior acetabular rim; in the presence of an increased alpha angle, the aspheric head-neck junction abuts the rim, imparting shear forces to the anterosuperior labrum.\n\nRadiographic measurements for two hips are:\n- Hip X: $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$, alpha angle $= 48^\\circ$.\n- Hip Y: $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$, alpha angle $= 62^\\circ$.\n\nWhich option best classifies each hip and predicts the predominant labral loading pattern in single-leg stance and in deep flexion with internal rotation?\n\nA. Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; in single-leg stance, the superolateral to anterosuperior labrum experiences increased compressive edge loading and hoop tension; Hip Y shows cam-type femoroacetabular impingement; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the anterosuperior labrum is subjected primarily to shear from femoral head-neck abutment, while quiet stance produces relatively lower labral load than the dysplastic hip.\n\nB. Hip X has normal coverage; in single-leg stance, the labrum is unloaded relative to cartilage; Hip Y shows pincer-type impingement; the labrum is primarily compressed circumferentially both in stance and flexion.\n\nC. Hip X demonstrates acetabular overcoverage; the posteroinferior labrum is preferentially loaded in single-leg stance; Hip Y shows cam deformity; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the posteroinferior labrum is primarily stressed.\n\nD. Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; however, the labrum is unloaded in stance because reduced coverage shifts all load to cartilage; Hip Y shows cam deformity; the principal labral injury occurs posteroinferiorly during hip extension rather than flexion with internal rotation.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All definitions, principles, and data are standard within the fields of orthopedic radiology and biomechanics. The problem is self-contained and allows for a unique solution based on the provided information.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying the given definitions, thresholds, and biomechanical principles to each hip individually.\n\nAnalysis of Hip X:\nGivens for Hip X are $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$ and alpha angle $= 48^\\circ$.\n1.  **Classification:** The problem defines developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) as suggested when $\\text{CEA} < 20^\\circ$. For Hip X, $\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ$, which satisfies the condition $18^\\circ < 20^\\circ$. Therefore, Hip X is classified as having developmental dysplasia of the hip. The problem defines a cam deformity as suggested when the alpha angle $> 55^\\circ$. For Hip X, the alpha angle is $48^\\circ$, which does not satisfy the condition $48^\\circ > 55^\\circ$. Thus, Hip X does not have a cam deformity. The primary diagnosis is acetabular dysplasia.\n\n2.  **Loading Pattern:** The problem's first biomechanical principle states that in single-leg stance, reduced osseous coverage (as in DDH) biases contact forces toward the superolateral rim. The labrum resists these rim-directed loads. This increased loading on the labral rim results in both direct compressive stress (edge loading) and tensile stress along its circumference (hoop stress). This pathological loading predominantly affects the superolateral and anterosuperior aspects of the labrum, which are most under-covered in dysplastic hips.\n\nAnalysis of Hip Y:\nGivens for Hip Y are $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$ and alpha angle $= 62^\\circ$.\n1.  **Classification:** For Hip Y, $\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$. This does not meet the criterion for DDH ($\\text{CEA} < 20^\\circ$). A $\\text{CEA}$ of $30^\\circ$ is within the normal range (typically considered $25^\\circ$ to $39^\\circ$), indicating adequate acetabular coverage. For Hip Y, the alpha angle is $62^\\circ$. This satisfies the condition for a cam deformity, $62^\\circ > 55^\\circ$. Therefore, Hip Y is classified as having a cam deformity, which is the characteristic feature of cam-type femoroacetabular impingement (FAI).\n\n2.  **Loading Pattern:** The problem's second biomechanical principle describes the loading pattern in the presence of an increased alpha angle. During deep hip flexion (approximately $90^\\circ$) with internal rotation (approximately $20^\\circ$), the aspheric femoral head-neck junction abuts the anterosuperior acetabular rim, imparting shear forces to the anterosuperior labrum. This is the classic mechanism of injury in cam-type FAI. In single-leg stance, because Hip Y has normal osseous coverage ($\\text{CEA} = 30^\\circ$), the joint reaction force is expected to be distributed more centrally over the superior acetabular cartilage dome, leading to relatively lower labral loading compared to the dysplastic Hip X, where forces are concentrated on the rim.\n\nEvaluation of Options:\n\nA. **Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; in single-leg stance, the superolateral to anterosuperior labrum experiences increased compressive edge loading and hoop tension; Hip Y shows cam-type femoroacetabular impingement; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the anterosuperior labrum is subjected primarily to shear from femoral head-neck abutment, while quiet stance produces relatively lower labral load than the dysplastic hip.**\nThis option correctly classifies Hip X as dysplastic ($\\text{CEA} = 18^\\circ < 20^\\circ$) and accurately describes the resultant labral loading in stance (increased compressive and hoop stress on the superolateral rim). It correctly classifies Hip Y as having a cam deformity/impingement ($\\text{alpha angle} = 62^\\circ > 55^\\circ$) and accurately describes the loading in flexion/internal rotation (anterosuperior shear). It also correctly infers that the labral load in stance for the normally-covered Hip Y is lower than for the dysplastic Hip X. All statements are consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. **Hip X has normal coverage; in single-leg stance, the labrum is unloaded relative to cartilage; Hip Y shows pincer-type impingement; the labrum is primarily compressed circumferentially both in stance and flexion.**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Hip X as having normal coverage; its $\\text{CEA}$ of $18^\\circ$ is dysplastic. The claim that the labrum is unloaded is contrary to the provided principles for dysplastic hips. It incorrectly classifies Hip Y as having pincer-type impingement, which is associated with acetabular overcoverage, not the femoral cam deformity present here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. **Hip X demonstrates acetabular overcoverage; the posteroinferior labrum is preferentially loaded in single-leg stance; Hip Y shows cam deformity; in deep flexion with internal rotation, the posteroinferior labrum is primarily stressed.**\nThis option incorrectly classifies Hip X as having overcoverage; its $\\text{CEA}$ of $18^\\circ$ represents undercoverage. It incorrectly identifies the posteroinferior labrum as the loaded region in stance for a dysplastic hip; the load is superolateral. While it correctly identifies the cam deformity in Hip Y, it incorrectly states the impingement and stress occur on the posteroinferior labrum; the problem and established mechanics specify the anterosuperior region.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. **Hip X shows developmental dysplasia of the hip; however, the labrum is unloaded in stance because reduced coverage shifts all load to cartilage; Hip Y shows cam deformity; the principal labral injury occurs posteroinferiorly during hip extension rather than flexion with internal rotation.**\nThis option correctly identifies Hip X as dysplastic but makes a false claim about labral loading. Reduced coverage shifts load *onto* the labral rim, not away from it. While it correctly identifies the cam deformity in Hip Y, it describes an incorrect location and mechanism of injury, contradicting the specific mechanism provided in the problem statement (anterosuperior impingement during flexion/internal rotation).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
