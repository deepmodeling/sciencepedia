This practice demonstrates this principle quantitatively by applying the fundamental concept of pressure, $p = F/A$, to compare the stress on the tibial cartilage with and without a meniscus. By working through this hypothetical scenario , you will gain a clear, numerical appreciation for why protecting the menisci is critical for preventing degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis.",

            "problem": "A healthy adult knee joint transmits axial load from the femur to the tibial plateau. The lateral meniscus increases tibiofemoral congruence and distributes load over a larger contact area, thereby reducing compressive stress borne by the articular cartilage. Consider an axial load of $F=2000\\ \\mathrm{N}$ applied to the lateral compartment during a functional activity. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)-based morphometrics provide the following effective load-bearing contact areas for the lateral compartment: with the lateral meniscus intact, $A_{1}=800\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$; after lateral meniscectomy, $A_{2}=300\\ \\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. Assume the load is transmitted as a uniform normal compressive stress over the stated contact areas and neglect shear friction.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and standard International System of Units (SI) conversions, determine the expected peak contact pressure in the lateral compartment for the two conditions (with the lateral meniscus and after meniscectomy).

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem statement directs the use of a fundamental linear elasticity relationship to model the behavior of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL). The ACL is modeled as a single linear elastic element, which is mathematically equivalent to an ideal spring. The governing equation for such an element is Hooke's Law.\n\nHooke's Law states that the force, $F$, required to stretch or compress a spring by some distance, $x$, from its equilibrium position is directly proportional to that distance. The constant of proportionality is the stiffness, $k$, of the spring. The relationship is expressed as:\n$$F = kx$$\n\nIn this problem:\n-   $F$ is the applied anterior drawer force, given as $F = 150 \\ \\mathrm{N}$.\n-   $k$ is the effective stiffness of the ACL, given as $k = 200 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}$.\n-   $x$ is the deformation of the ligament. The problem states that for the small displacements considered, the ligament elongation is equal to the anterior tibial translation. Therefore, $x$ represents the anterior tibial translation we need to find.\n\nTo solve for the anterior tibial translation, $x$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$x = \\frac{F}{k}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into the equation:\n$$x = \\frac{150 \\ \\mathrm{N}}{200 \\ \\mathrm{N/mm}}$$\n\nPerforming the division:\n$$x = 0.75 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in millimeters and rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.75$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$x = 0.750 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThis value represents the anterior tibial translation under the specified load and modeling assumptions.",

The resultant quadriceps force has magnitude $F_q$ and is aligned from the anterior superior iliac spine to the center of the patella.
