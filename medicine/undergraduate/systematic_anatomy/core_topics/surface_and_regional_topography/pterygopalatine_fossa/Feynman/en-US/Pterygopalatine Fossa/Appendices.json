In Case X, high-resolution imaging shows focal narrowing at the foramen rotundum compressing the maxillary nerve ($V_{2}$) proximal to its branching.

You are asked to design a bedside sensory examination and dental pulp testing panel that could empirically distinguish the two cases by predicting which cutaneous, mucosal, and dental territories would be anesthetic in each.\n\nUsing only the following foundational facts: (i) a lesion proximal to branching interrupts all downstream branches, whereas a lesion distal to a branch spares that branch’s territory; (ii) the maxillary division $V_{2}$ enters the pterygopalatine fossa via the foramen rotundum, where it gives off the zygomatic nerve (to the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal skin), ganglionic branches to the pterygopalatine ganglion (source of greater and lesser palatine and nasopalatine nerves to the palate and posterior nasal cavity), and the posterior superior alveolar nerve (to maxillary molar teeth and adjacent buccal gingiva), and then continues as the infraorbital nerve, which in the infraorbital canal gives rise to the anterior and middle superior alveolar nerves (to maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars) before emerging to supply the lower eyelid, lateral nose, and upper lip; select the option that best states a testable prediction distinguishing Case X from Case Y.\n\nA.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n\n**Case Descriptions:**\n*   **Case X:** A benign mass causes focal narrowing at the foramen rotundum, compressing the maxillary nerve ($V_{2}$) proximal to its branching.\n*   **Case Y:** A cyst within the pterygopalatine fossa abuts the distal continuation of $V_{2}$ after it has given off its major branches in the fossa, just before the nerve enters the infraorbital groove as the infraorbital nerve.\n\n**Foundational Facts:**\n*   **(i)** A lesion proximal to branching interrupts all downstream branches, whereas a lesion distal to a branch spares that branch’s territory.\n*   **(ii)** The maxillary division $V_{2}$ enters the pterygopalatine fossa via the foramen rotundum.\n    *   In the fossa, it gives off the following branches:\n        *   Zygomatic nerve (to the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal skin).\n        *   Ganglionic branches to the pterygopalatine ganglion (which is the source of the greater and lesser palatine and nasopalatine nerves to the palate and posterior nasal cavity).\n        *   Posterior superior alveolar nerve (to maxillary molar teeth and adjacent buccal gingiva).\n    *   $V_{2}$ then continues as the infraorbital nerve.\n    *   The infraorbital nerve, in the infraorbital canal, gives rise to the anterior and middle superior alveolar nerves (to maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars).\n    *   The infraorbital nerve emerges to supply the lower eyelid, lateral nose, and upper lip.\n\n**Question:**\nSelect the option that best states a testable prediction distinguishing Case X from Case Y based on the expected sensory deficits.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in standard human neuroanatomy, specifically the course and distribution of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve ($V_{2}$). The anatomical structures (foramen rotundum, pterygopalatine fossa, infraorbital canal), nerve branches (zygomatic, superior alveolar, palatine), and their sensory territories are described accurately according to established anatomical knowledge. The clinical scenarios (compression by a mass) are realistic.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides two distinct lesion locations and a set of anatomical rules. The task is to apply these rules to predict the resulting sensory deficits, which allows for a unique and logical solution. The information provided is sufficient to distinguish between the two cases.\n*   **Objective:** The problem uses precise, objective anatomical and clinical terminology. The question asks for a \"testable prediction,\" which is a request for a logical deduction based on the provided facts, free of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The premises are clear, consistent, and scientifically valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires applying the principle of proximal versus distal nerve injury to the specific anatomical locations described for Case X and Case Y, using the provided branching pattern of the maxillary nerve ($V_{2}$).\n\n### Analysis of Case X\n\n*   **Lesion Location:** The lesion is at the foramen rotundum, compressing the maxillary nerve ($V_{2}$) *proximal* to its branching within the pterygopalatine fossa.\n*   **Application of Principle (i):** A lesion proximal to branching interrupts all downstream branches. Since the lesion is on the main trunk of $V_{2}$ before it gives off any of its branches in the pterygopalatine fossa, all sensory functions supplied by $V_{2}$ will be compromised.\n*   **Predicted Deficits:**\n    1.  **Zygomatic nerve:** Sensation will be lost from the zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal skin (numbness over the cheek prominence).\n    2.  **Ganglionic branches to pterygopalatine ganglion:** Sensation will be lost from the hard palate and posterior nasal cavity.\n    3.  **Posterior superior alveolar (PSA) nerve:** Sensation will be lost from the maxillary molar teeth and adjacent buccal gingiva.\n    4.  **Infraorbital nerve and its branches:**\n        *   **Anterior and Middle Superior Alveolar (ASA/MSA) nerves:** Sensation will be lost from the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars.\n        *   **Terminal cutaneous branches:** Sensation will be lost from the skin of the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, and the upper lip.\n*   **Conclusion for Case X:** There will be a complete loss of sensation in the entire distribution of the maxillary nerve. This includes the mid-facial skin, the entire maxillary dentition, the palate, and portions of the nasal mucosa.\n\n### Analysis of Case Y\n\n*   **Lesion Location:** The lesion is within the pterygopalatine fossa, affecting the distal continuation of $V_{2}$ *after* it has given off its major branches in the fossa. Specifically, it affects the nerve just before it becomes the infraorbital nerve.\n*   **Application of Principle (i):** A lesion distal to a branch spares that branch’s territory. The branches given off in the fossa, proximal to the lesion, will be unaffected. The nerve trunk that continues, and all its subsequent branches, will be affected.\n*   **Spared Branches and Territories:**\n    1.  **Zygomatic nerve:** Sensation over the cheek prominence will be preserved.\n    2.  **Ganglionic branches:** Sensation of the palate and posterior nasal cavity will be preserved.\n    3.  **Posterior superior alveolar (PSA) nerve:** Sensation of the maxillary molar teeth will be preserved.\n*   **Affected Nerve and Territories:** The lesion directly impacts the nerve as it becomes the infraorbital nerve. Therefore, the infraorbital nerve and all its branches will be compromised.\n    1.  **Anterior and Middle Superior Alveolar (ASA/MSA) nerves:** Sensation will be lost from the maxillary incisors, canines, and premolars.\n    2.  **Terminal cutaneous branches:** Sensation will be lost from the skin of the lower eyelid, the side of the nose, and the upper lip.\n*   **Conclusion for Case Y:** Sensory loss will be confined to the distribution of the infraorbital nerve. The cheek prominence (zygomatic), palate, posterior nasal cavity, and maxillary molars will have normal sensation. The lower eyelid, side of nose, upper lip, and anterior/middle maxillary teeth will be numb.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Case X will show loss of pinprick over the hard palate and posterior lateral nasal wall, numbness over the zygomatic prominence, anesthesia of the entire maxillary dentition including molars, and reduced sensation over the lower eyelid, lateral nose, and upper lip; Case Y will show reduced sensation over the lower eyelid, lateral nose, and upper lip with loss of dental pulp sensation in incisors, canines, and premolars, but preserved palatal and posterior nasal sensation, preserved sensation over the zygomatic prominence, and preserved molar pulps.**\n*   The description for Case X matches our derivation perfectly, listing deficits from all branches of $V_{2}$.\n*   The description for Case Y also matches our derivation perfectly, citing deficits only in the infraorbital nerve distribution while noting that sensation supplied by the zygomatic, palatine, and posterior superior alveolar nerves is preserved.\n*   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In both cases, dental pulp testing will be normal because $V_{2}$ does not innervate teeth; the only reliable distinction is that tearing will be reduced in Case X but normal in Case Y.**\n*   This statement claims that \"$V_{2}$ does not innervate teeth,\" which is directly contradicted by foundational fact (ii). Fact (ii) explicitly states that the posterior superior alveolar nerve (from $V_{2}$) innervates maxillary molars, and the anterior/middle superior alveolar nerves (from the infraorbital nerve, a continuation of $V_{2}$) innervate the other maxillary teeth. The premise of this option is false based on the information provided in the problem.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Case Y will show isolated palatal anesthesia with intact facial skin and normal dental pulps, whereas Case X will have only mild facial hypoesthesia limited to the upper lip.**\n*   The prediction for Case Y is incorrect. Palatal sensation should be preserved in Case Y, as the lesion is distal to the ganglionic branches.\n*   The prediction for Case X is incorrect. A lesion of the entire $V_{2}$ trunk would cause widespread, not limited, sensory loss.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Case X will selectively numb the zygomatic region and lower eyelid but spare the palate and all dental pulps, whereas Case Y will abolish sensation from the upper lip and nasal vestibule only.**\n*   The prediction for Case X is incorrect. A proximal lesion would not spare the palate and teeth.\n*   The prediction for Case Y is incomplete and therefore inaccurate. The lesion would affect the entire infraorbital distribution, including the lower eyelid and anterior/middle teeth, not just the upper lip and nasal vestibule.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Case Y will abolish molar and palatal sensation while sparing the midface skin, whereas Case X will affect only the nasal cavity mucosa with no dental or cutaneous changes.**\n*   The prediction for Case Y is the opposite of what is expected. Case Y spares molar and palatal sensation but affects the midface skin.\n*   The prediction for Case X is grossly incorrect. A lesion of the main trunk of $V_{2}$ would cause extensive dental and cutaneous deficits, not just isolated mucosal changes.\n*   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The clinical scenario of an iatrogenic nerve injury during orbital floor surgery is realistic and well-documented.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific lesion and asks for a specific functional consequence. It clearly delineates which structures are damaged and which are preserved, creating a solvable problem with a unique, anatomically-derived solution.\n-   **Objective:** The terminology is precise and anatomical (e.g., \"zygomaticotemporal branch,\" \"pterygopalatine ganglion\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is a standard, albeit complex, question of applied neuroanatomy.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution from First Principles**\n\nTo predict the outcome, we must trace the relevant neural pathways.\n\n1.  **Parasympathetic Pathway for Lacrimation (Secretomotor):**\n    -   **Origin:** Preganglionic parasympathetic cell bodies are located in the superior salivatory nucleus in the pons.\n    -   **Course to Ganglion:** These fibers travel as part of the facial nerve (CN VII), then branch off as the greater petrosal nerve. The greater petrosal nerve joins the deep petrosal nerve (carrying postganglionic sympathetic fibers) to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal (Vidian nerve). This nerve enters the pterygopalatine fossa.\n    -   **Synapse:** The preganglionic parasympathetic fibers synapse in the pterygopalatine ganglion. The problem states this ganglion is preserved.\n    -   **Postganglionic Course:** This is the critical part of the pathway relevant to the injury. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers exit the ganglion and join the maxillary nerve (CN $V_{2}$). They then enter its zygomatic branch. The zygomatic nerve passes into the orbit and divides into zygomaticofacial and zygomaticotemporal branches. The postganglionic secretomotor fibers travel with the zygomaticotemporal nerve.\n    -   **Final Delivery:** The fibers leave the zygomaticotemporal nerve via the specified **communicating branch** to join the lacrimal nerve (a branch of CN $V_{1}$). They then travel within the lacrimal nerve to reach the lacrimal gland and stimulate aqueous tear secretion.\n    -   **Effect of Lesion:** Severing the communicating branch between the zygomaticotemporal nerve and the lacrimal nerve physically interrupts the final common pathway for these postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to reach the lacrimal gland. Therefore, secretomotor innervation to the gland is lost, resulting in a marked reduction of tear production (specifically, the aqueous component of tears).\n\n2.  **Somatic Sensory Pathway for the Lateral Eyelid/Lacrimal Gland Region:**\n    -   **Origin of Sensation:** General somatic sensation (touch, pain, temperature) from the skin of the lateral upper eyelid, the conjunctiva, and the lacrimal gland itself is carried by the lacrimal nerve.\n    -   **Course:** The lacrimal nerve is a primary branch of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (CN $V_{1}$). Sensory fibers travel proximally along the main trunk of the lacrimal nerve, through the superior orbital fissure, into the middle cranial fossa, to the trigeminal ganglion (where their cell bodies reside), and finally into the brainstem.\n    -   **Effect of Lesion:** The problem explicitly states that the \"main trunk of the lacrimal nerve\" is preserved. The communicating branch that was severed carries fibers *to* the lacrimal nerve, not *from* it in the context of this sensory pathway. Therefore, the pathway for somatic sensation from the regions supplied by the lacrimal nerve remains intact. Sensation should be preserved.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on fundamental neuroanatomical principles, severing the communicating branch will lead to a **marked reduction in ipsilateral tear secretion** (due to interruption of the parasympathetic pathway) and **preserved somatic sensation** over the area supplied by the lacrimal nerve (because its main trunk is intact).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Marked reduction of tear secretion from the ipsilateral lacrimal gland with preserved cutaneous and conjunctival sensation over the lateral upper eyelid and lacrimal gland region**\n-   This option states that tear secretion is markedly reduced, which is consistent with the interruption of the postganglionic parasympathetic supply to the lacrimal gland.\n-   It also states that sensation is preserved, which is consistent with the preservation of the main trunk of the lacrimal nerve (CN $V_{1}$).\n-   This outcome perfectly aligns with the derived prediction.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Normal tear secretion due to an alternate parasympathetic route, but loss of sensation over the lacrimal gland region and lateral upper eyelid**\n-   This option claims normal tear secretion. This is incorrect. While anatomical variations exist, the described pathway is the principal route, and its interruption would cause a significant deficit. The problem asks for the most likely effect based on fundamental organization, which is the interruption.\n-   It claims loss of sensation. This is incorrect. Sensation is carried by the main trunk of the lacrimal nerve ($V_{1}$), which is stated to be preserved. The communicating branch does not carry the primary sensory fibers from this region.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Loss of the afferent limb of the corneal reflex with normal tear secretion at rest and during reflex stimulation**\n-   The afferent (sensory) limb of the corneal reflex is mediated primarily by the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic nerve ($V_{1}$), which detects the stimulus on the cornea. The lacrimal nerve is not the primary carrier of this reflex's afferent limb.\n-   It claims normal tear secretion, which is incorrect as the efferent secretomotor pathway is cut. Both basal and reflex tearing would be compromised.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Decreased nasal mucous gland secretion with normal lacrimal gland secretion**\n-   Nasal mucous glands are innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from the pterygopalatine ganglion that travel via different branches of $V_{2}$ (e.g., posterior superior nasal nerves). The lesion to the communicating branch of the zygomatic nerve is too distal to affect these nasal branches.\n-   It claims normal lacrimal gland secretion, which has been established as incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Decreased parotid salivation with increased lacrimal secretion due to unopposed sympathetic influence**\n-   Parotid gland innervation is from the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) and the otic ganglion, a completely separate pathway. It would not be affected.\n-   It claims *increased* lacrimal secretion. This is physiologically and anatomically incorrect. Loss of the primary secretomotor (parasympathetic) drive would lead to a profound decrease, not an increase, in secretion. Sympathetic stimulation produces a scant, viscous secretion, and its \"unopposed\" influence would not compensate for the loss of parasympathetic drive.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

The goal is to distinguish injuries at three sequential levels along the secretomotor pathway to the lacrimal gland that traverse the pterygopalatine fossa: the pterygopalatine ganglion, the zygomatic nerve of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, and the lacrimal nerve of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. Use only clinical examination maneuvers that probe functions logically tied to each level.\n\nYou may assume the following well-established anatomic facts as the starting base. Secretomotor parasympathetic fibers to the lacrimal gland originate in the superior salivatory nucleus and travel in the greater petrosal nerve of the facial nerve to the pterygopalatine ganglion in the pterygopalatine fossa, where they synapse. Postganglionic fibers then hitchhike on branches of the maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, specifically the zygomatic nerve and its zygomaticotemporal branch, and subsequently reach the lacrimal gland via a communicating branch to the lacrimal nerve of the ophthalmic division. The pterygopalatine ganglion also distributes parasympathetic fibers to the nasal and palatal mucosal glands. The zygomatic nerve carries general somatic sensation from the malar prominence and anterior temporal region. The lacrimal nerve carries general somatic sensation from the lateral upper eyelid and adjacent bulbar conjunctiva, and a communicating branch conveys secretomotor fibers to the lacrimal gland.\n\nCandidate clinical tests available to include in the algorithm are: a tear production assessment such as the Schirmer test or reflex tearing to a standard stimulus; inspection and endoscopic assessment of ipsilateral nasal and palatal mucosal moisture; light touch and pinprick testing over the zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial skin; and light touch testing over the lateral upper eyelid and adjacent bulbar conjunctiva.\n\nWhich option below presents a logically minimal decision pathway that, if followed, can uniquely localize the lesion to one of the three specified levels in a patient with unilateral hypolacrimation?\n\nA. First, confirm decreased tear production to establish hypolacrimation. Next, assess ipsilateral nasal and palatal mucosal moisture; if these are also dry, localize to the pterygopalatine ganglion.

We must build a decision tree using the provided clinical tests.\n\n1.  **Analysis of a Lesion at the Pterygopalatine Ganglion (PPG):** The PPG is the most proximal of the three sites. It functions as a distribution hub for postganglionic parasympathetic fibers to multiple targets.\n    *   A lesion here would interrupt fibers to the lacrimal gland, causing hypolacrimation.\n    *   Crucially, it would also interrupt fibers to the nasal and palatal mucosal glands, causing ipsilateral dryness of the nose and palate.\n    *   This combination of signs (hypolacrimation + dry nasal/palatal mucosa) is unique to a lesion at or proximal to the PPG.\n\n2.  **Analysis of a Lesion at the Zygomatic Nerve (ZN):** This lesion is distal to the PPG.\n    *   It would interrupt the \"hitchhiking\" postganglionic parasympathetic fibers en route to the lacrimal gland, causing hypolacrimation.\n    *   Since the fibers to the nasal and palatal glands branch off at the PPG, a lesion of the ZN *after* it leaves the pterygopalatine fossa would spare these glands. Thus, nasal and palatal moisture would be normal.\n    *   The ZN also carries its own somatic sensory fibers. A lesion of the ZN would cause sensory loss in its distribution (malar and anterior temporal skin).\n    *   This combination (hypolacrimation + normal nasal/palatal moisture + sensory loss in ZN territory) is unique to a ZN lesion.\n\n3.  **Analysis of a Lesion at the Lacrimal Nerve (LN):** This is the most distal site involving a nerve trunk.\n    *   A lesion here would interrupt the secretomotor fibers just before they enter the lacrimal gland, causing hypolacrimation.\n    *   The lesion is far distal to the PPG, so nasal and palatal moisture would be normal.\n    *   The lesion is also distal to the ZN trunk, so sensation in the ZN territory would be normal.\n    *   The LN carries its own somatic sensory fibers. A lesion affecting the nerve trunk would cause sensory loss in its distribution (lateral upper eyelid and adjacent conjunctiva).\n    *   This combination (hypolacrimation + normal nasal/palatal moisture + normal ZN sensation + sensory loss in LN territory) is unique to an LN lesion.\n\n**Optimal Decision Algorithm:**\n\nBased on this analysis, the most efficient and logical algorithm is as follows:\n*   **Start:** Patient has unilateral hypolacrimation.\n*   **Step 1:** Assess ipsilateral nasal and palatal mucosal moisture.\n    *   If **dry**, the lesion is at the **Pterygopalatine Ganglion** (or proximal). The algorithm can stop.\n    *   If **moist**, the lesion is distal to the PPG. Proceed to Step 2.\n*   **Step 2:** Assess sensation in the ZN territory (malar/temporal).\n    *   If **reduced**, the lesion involves the **Zygomatic Nerve**. The algorithm can stop.\n    *   If **normal**, the lesion is distal to the main ZN trunk. Proceed to Step 3.\n*   **Step 3:** Assess sensation in the LN territory (lateral upper eyelid).\n    *   If **reduced**, the lesion involves the **Lacrimal Nerve**.\n    *   If **normal**, the lesion is highly specific to the communicating branch or is intrinsic to the lacrimal gland itself, which is outside the scope of localizing to the three specified nerve levels.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. First, confirm decreased tear production to establish hypolacrimation. Next, assess ipsilateral nasal and palatal mucosal moisture; if these are also dry, localize to the pterygopalatine ganglion. If nasal and palatal moisture are normal, test cutaneous sensation in the zygomaticotemporal and zygomaticofacial territories; if reduced, localize to the zygomatic nerve. If those are normal, test sensation in the lateral upper eyelid and adjacent bulbar conjunctiva; if reduced, localize to the lacrimal nerve. If all sensory territories are normal, suspect a non-neural lacrimal gland disorder.**\n\nThis option precisely follows the logical, step-by-step algorithm derived from the anatomical first principles. It correctly identifies the key differentiating sign at each step: nasal/palatal dryness for PPG lesions, ZN sensory loss for ZN lesions, and LN sensory loss for LN lesions, in the correct hierarchical order. The final statement about a non-neural disorder is a reasonable clinical conclusion if the neural pathways test normal.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. First, test the corneal blink reflex; if absent, attribute dry eye to a facial nerve lesion and localize to the pterygopalatine ganglion. If present, test sensation over the lateral upper eyelid; if reduced, localize to the zygomatic nerve. If normal, infer a lacrimal nerve lesion.**\n\nThis option contains multiple errors.\n1.  An absent motor component of the corneal blink reflex indicates a lesion of the facial nerve's motor branches to the orbicularis oculi, not a lesion of the PPG. The preganglionic fibers for lacrimation leave the facial nerve (as the greater petrosal nerve) well before the branches to the facial muscles. This initial step is logically flawed.\n2.  Testing sensation over the lateral upper eyelid probes the lacrimal nerve ($V_1$), not the zygomatic nerve ($V_2$). The option incorrectly associates this finding with a ZN lesion.\n3.  Inferring a lacrimal nerve lesion when sensation in its territory is normal is illogical.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. First, administer a topical ocular anesthetic; if tearing increases, localize to the lacrimal nerve. If tearing does not increase, inspect nasal mucosa; if moist, localize to the pterygopalatine ganglion; if dry, localize to the zygomatic nerve.**\n\nThis option is flawed both physiologically and anatomically.\n1.  A topical ocular anesthetic blocks afferent nerve signals from the cornea and conjunctiva. This would *decrease* reflex tearing, not increase it. The initial premise is physiologically false.\n2.  The subsequent logic is inverted. Moist nasal mucosa indicates the PPG is intact, yet the option localizes to the PPG. Dry nasal mucosa indicates a PPG lesion, yet the option localizes to the ZN.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. First, assess taste on the anterior tongue and hyperacusis; if either is abnormal, localize to the pterygopalatine ganglion. If both are normal, assess palatal moisture; if reduced, localize to the zygomatic nerve; if normal, localize to the lacrimal nerve.**\n\nThis option contains anatomical errors in localization.\n1.  Taste to the anterior tongue (chorda tympani) and innervation of the stapedius muscle (nerve to stapedius) are functions of the facial nerve *distal* to the origin of the greater petrosal nerve. A lesion affecting these would spare lacrimation. A lesion of the greater petrosal nerve or PPG would spare taste and stapedius function. Associating these signs with a PPG lesion is incorrect.\n2.  Reduced palatal moisture is a sign of a PPG lesion, not a ZN lesion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
