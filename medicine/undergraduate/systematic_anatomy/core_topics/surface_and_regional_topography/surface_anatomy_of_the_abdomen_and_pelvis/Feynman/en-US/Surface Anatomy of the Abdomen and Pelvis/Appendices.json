This exercise demonstrates this principle by creating a simplified model of the torso, allowing you to calculate the vertical spacing between key abdominal planes.

            "problem": "A clinician is evaluating surface landmarks along the anterior midline of an adult torso for procedural planning. Use the following well-tested anatomical facts as the starting point: the subcostal plane corresponds to the inferior border of the tenth costal cartilage and lies at approximately $L_3$; the intertubercular plane passes through the iliac tubercles and lies at approximately $L_5$; the transumbilical plane (umbilicus) lies at approximately the $L_3–L_4$ intervertebral disc. Additionally, for anchoring the skin–spine mapping, assume the suprasternal notch lies opposite approximately $T_2$ and the pubic symphysis lies opposite approximately $S_1$.\n\nModel the vertical position of skin landmarks along the midline as linearly proportional to successive vertebral levels between $T_2$ and $S_1$. That is, treat each adjacent vertebral level transition (for example, $T_2$ to $T_3$, $T_3$ to $T_4$, …, $L_4$ to $L_5$, $L_5$ to $S_1$) as one equal “step” along the skin. The torso length from $T_2$ to $S_1$ along the midline is measured to be $60$ cm.\n\nUnder these assumptions, compute the vertical spacings, in centimeters, between:\n- the umbilicus and the subcostal plane,\n- the subcostal plane and the intertubercular plane,\n- the umbilicus and the intertubercular plane.\n\nExpress all three distances as positive values in centimeters and round your final answers to four significant figures. Provide your final answer as a single row of three numbers (a row matrix), in the order listed above.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in anatomical principles, well-posed with a clear mathematical model, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of vertical distances between specified anatomical landmarks on the anterior torso. The solution is based on a provided linear model where the vertical position along the midline is proportional to the vertebral levels, spanning from the suprasternal notch (approximated at vertebral level $T_2$) to the pubic symphysis (approximated at $S_1$).\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of discrete, equal \"steps\" in our model. The vertebral column segment of interest includes vertebrae from $T_2$ to $S_1$. The specific vertebral levels are:\n- Thoracic vertebrae: $T_2, T_3, T_4, T_5, T_6, T_7, T_8, T_9, T_{10}, T_{11}, T_{12}$. The number of these vertebrae is $12 - 2 + 1 = 11$.\n- Lumbar vertebrae: $L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4, L_5$. The number of these is $5$.\n- Sacral vertebra: $S_1$. The number is $1$.\n\nThe total number of vertebral levels in this sequence, $N_{vert}$, is the sum:\n$$N_{vert} = 11 + 5 + 1 = 17$$\nA \"step\" is defined as the transition between adjacent vertebral levels. For a sequence of $N_{vert}$ levels, there are $N_{vert} - 1$ such transitions.\nThus, the total number of equal steps, $N_{steps}$, within the specified segment is:\n$$N_{steps} = 17 - 1 = 16$$\nThe total vertical distance along the midline is given as $L_{total} = 60 \\text{ cm}$. Since these $16$ steps are of equal length, the length of a single step, $\\Delta z$, is calculated as:\n$$\\Delta z = \\frac{L_{total}}{N_{steps}} = \\frac{60 \\text{ cm}}{16} = 3.75 \\text{ cm}$$\nNext, we establish a one-dimensional coordinate system with the origin at the level of $T_2$. The position of any vertebral level is determined by the number of steps from $T_2$. Let $s(V)$ denote the number of steps from $T_2$ to a given vertebra $V$.\n\nThe positions of the relevant vertebral levels are:\n- The starting point $T_2$ is at $s(T_2) = 0$ steps.\n- The position of $L_3$: To reach $L_3$ from $T_2$, we traverse the segments from $T_2$ to $T_{12}$ ($10$ steps), from $T_{12}$ to $L_1$ ($1$ step), and from $L_1$ to $L_3$ ($2$ steps). The total number of steps to $L_3$ is $s(L_3) = 10 + 1 + 2 = 13$ steps.\n- The position of $L_5$: Similarly, the number of steps to $L_5$ is $s(L_5) = 10 + 1 + 4 = 15$ steps.\n\nNow, we map the anatomical landmarks to their positions in this step-based coordinate system:\n- The subcostal plane ($SC$) lies at level $L_3$. Its position is $s_{SC} = s(L_3) = 13$ steps.\n- The intertubercular plane ($IT$) lies at level $L_5$. Its position is $s_{IT} = s(L_5) = 15$ steps.\n- The umbilicus ($U$) lies at the $L_3-L_4$ intervertebral disc. In a linear model, the position of the disc between two levels is axiomatically placed at their midpoint. The position of $L_4$ is $s(L_4) = s(L_3) + 1 = 14$ steps. Therefore, the position of the umbilicus is:\n$$s_U = \\frac{s(L_3) + s(L_4)}{2} = \\frac{13 + 14}{2} = 13.5 \\text{ steps}$$\nWith the positions of all landmarks defined, we can compute the separations in steps, and then convert them to physical distances in centimeters.\n\n1.  **Umbilicus to Subcostal Plane ($d_{U-SC}$):**\n    The separation in steps is $\\Delta s_{U-SC} = |s_U - s_{SC}| = |13.5 - 13| = 0.5$ steps.\n    The physical distance is:\n    $$d_{U-SC} = \\Delta s_{U-SC} \\times \\Delta z = 0.5 \\times 3.75 \\text{ cm} = 1.875 \\text{ cm}$$\n2.  **Subcostal Plane to Intertubercular Plane ($d_{SC-IT}$):**\n    The separation in steps is $\\Delta s_{SC-IT} = |s_{IT} - s_{SC}| = |15 - 13| = 2$ steps.\n    The physical distance is:\n    $$d_{SC-IT} = \\Delta s_{SC-IT} \\times \\Delta z = 2 \\times 3.75 \\text{ cm} = 7.5 \\text{ cm}$$\n3.  **Umbilicus to Intertubercular Plane ($d_{U-IT}$):**\n    The separation in steps is $\\Delta s_{U-IT} = |s_{IT} - s_U| = |15 - 13.5| = 1.5$ steps.\n    The physical distance is:\n    $$d_{U-IT} = \\Delta s_{U-IT} \\times \\Delta z = 1.5 \\times 3.75 \\text{ cm} = 5.625 \\text{ cm}$$\n\nThe problem demands that the final answers be rounded to four significant figures.\n- $1.875$ has four significant figures ($1, 8, 7, 5$). No rounding is necessary. The value is $1.875$.\n- $7.5$ has two significant figures ($7, 5$). To express this value to four significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point. The value is $7.500$.\n- $5.625$ has four significant figures ($5, 6, 2, 5$). No rounding is necessary. The value is $5.625$.\n\nThe three distances, in the requested order (umbilicus–subcostal, subcostal–intertubercular, umbilicus–intertubercular), are $1.875$ cm, $7.500$ cm, and $5.625$ cm.",

We can express the position vector of $\\mathbf{M}$ as a linear combination of the position vectors of $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{U}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\mathbf{A} + \\frac{1}{3}(\\mathbf{U} - \\mathbf{A})\n$$\nSubstituting the given coordinates:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = (0,0) + \\frac{1}{3}((12,9) - (0,0)) = \\frac{1}{3}(12,9) = (4,3)\n$$\nThe coordinates of McBurney's point are $\\mathbf{M}=(4,3)$.\n\nThe orientation of Langer's lines, given by the angle $\\alpha$ relative to the positive $x$-axis, is assumed to vary linearly along the segment $\\overline{AU}$. We are given the angles at the endpoints of this segment:\n- At the ASIS, $\\mathbf{A}$, the angle is $\\alpha_{A} = -20^{\\circ}$.\n- At the umbilicus, $\\mathbf{U}$, the angle is $\\alpha_{U} = 0^{\\circ}$.\n\nWe can model this linear variation using a parameter $s$ representing the fractional distance along the segment from $\\mathbf{A}$ ($s=0$) to $\\mathbf{U}$ ($s=1$). The angle $\\alpha(s)$ is given by the linear interpolation formula:\n$$\n\\alpha(s) = (1-s)\\alpha_{A} + s\\alpha_{U}\n$$\nBy its definition, McBurney's point corresponds to a fractional distance of $s = \\frac{1}{3}$.
