For a representative subject, the measured internal width is $w=5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, the internal height is $h=15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and the internal anteroposterior length is $l=30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Using only fundamental definitions of geometric volume and standard unit conversions, compute the volume of the third ventricle under this approximation.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the volume of a rectangular prism, which is used as a geometric approximation for the third ventricle of the diencephalon. The solution involves calculating the volume using the provided dimensions and then converting the result into the specified units.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n-   The shape is approximated as a rectangular prism.\n-   The internal width is $w = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   The internal height is $h = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   The internal anteroposterior length is $l = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   The final answer must be in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n\nThe volume $V$ of a rectangular prism is defined as the product of its length, width, and height. The formula is:\n$$V = l \\cdot w \\cdot h$$\nSubstituting the given dimensions into this formula:\n$$V = (30\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot (5\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\cdot (15\\,\\mathrm{mm})$$\nThe calculation of the numerical value is performed as follows:\n$$V = (150) \\cdot (15) \\, \\mathrm{mm}^3$$\n$$V = 2250 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^3$$\nThe volume is thus $2250$ cubic millimeters.\n\nThe next step is to convert this volume from cubic millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}^3$) to milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$). This requires established conversion factors. By definition, one milliliter is equivalent to one cubic centimeter ($1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$):\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$$\nThe relationship between centimeters and millimeters is:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nTo establish the relationship between the corresponding volume units, we must cube the linear conversion factor:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3 = (10\\,\\mathrm{mm})^3 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3$$\nBy combining these two identities, we obtain the direct conversion factor between milliliters and cubic millimeters:\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3$$\nTo convert the calculated volume $V$ from $\\mathrm{mm}^3$ to $\\mathrm{mL}$, we divide the value in $\\mathrm{mm}^3$ by the conversion factor $1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3/\\mathrm{mL}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{2250\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}^3/\\mathrm{mL}} = 2.25\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $2.25$ is composed of the digits $2$, $2$, and $5$, which are all significant. The number already has exactly three significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the third ventricle, under the given approximation, is $2.25\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.",

Neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (part of the diencephalon) increase synthesis of arginine vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which is released from the posterior pituitary and increases renal water reabsorption. Assume ADH causes an acute net gain of pure water $\\Delta V = 1\\,\\mathrm{L}$ without changing the total exchangeable sodium content of the body.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the concentration profile $C(t)$, and second, the calculation of the concentration at a specific time.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Concentration Expression $C(t)$**\n\nThe problem states that melatonin elimination follows first-order kinetics. This means the rate of change of the plasma melatonin concentration, $C(t)$, is directly proportional to the concentration itself. As this is an elimination process, the rate is negative. This can be expressed as a first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive elimination rate constant, and $t$ is time. The initial condition is given as $C(t=0) = C_0$.\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $C$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nTo find the concentration as a function of time, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial state $(t=0, C=C_0)$ to a general state $(t, C(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms on the left side:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis equation describes the concentration at any time $t$ in terms of the initial concentration $C_0$ and the rate constant $k$. However, the problem requires the expression in terms of the half-life, $t_{1/2}$.\n\nThe half-life is defined as the time at which the concentration drops to half of its initial value: $C(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}C_0$. We substitute this definition into our derived equation for $C(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}C_0 = C_0 \\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing both sides by $C_0$ (which is non-zero) gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kt_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $k$ in terms of $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{1/2}\n$$\nSince $\\ln(\\frac{1}{2}) = -\\ln(2)$, this becomes:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -kt_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for $k$ back into the general solution $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}t\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity $a\\exp(b\\ln(c)) = a c^b$, we can rewrite the expression. Let $c=2$, $b = -t/t_{1/2}$:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp\\left(\\ln(2) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right) = C_0 \\left(\\exp(\\ln(2))\\right)^{-t/t_{1/2}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\cdot 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}\n$$\nThis can also be written as $C(t) = C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}$. This is the desired expression for $C(t)$ in terms of $C_0$, $t$, and $t_{1/2}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Concentration at $t=2\\,\\mathrm{h}$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nInitial concentration, $C_0 = 80\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.\nHalf-life, $t_{1/2} = 40\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\nTime point of interest, $t = 2\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\nFirst, we must ensure that the units for $t$ and $t_{1/2}$ are consistent. We convert $t$ from hours to minutes:\n$$\nt = 2\\,\\mathrm{h} \\times \\frac{60\\,\\mathrm{min}}{1\\,\\mathrm{h}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{min}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the exponent in our derived formula. The term $t/t_{1/2}$ represents the number of half-lives that have elapsed:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{min}}{40\\,\\mathrm{min}} = 3\n$$\nThis indicates that the time elapsed is exactly $3$ half-lives.\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived equation for $C(t)$:\n$$\nC(120\\,\\mathrm{min}) = C_0 \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{t/t_{1/2}} = (80\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{3}\n$$\n$$\nC(120\\,\\mathrm{min}) = 80 \\times \\frac{1}{8} \\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}\n$$\n$$\nC(120\\,\\mathrm{min}) = 10\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact answer is $10$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $10.0$.\nTherefore, the plasma melatonin concentration at $t=2\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is $10.0\\,\\mathrm{pg/mL}$.",
