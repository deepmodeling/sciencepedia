            "introduction": "When a major cerebral artery is blocked, the brain's survival depends on collateral circulation—a network of smaller vessels that can reroute blood flow. This exercise explores the fundamental physics governing this critical compensatory mechanism. By applying a simplified model based on the Hagen–Poiseuille law, you will quantitatively discover why even a small increase in the radius of these collateral vessels can lead to a dramatic increase in blood flow, a principle that underscores the physiological importance of vasodilation in mitigating the effects of ischemic stroke.

Assume the dominant collateral segment supplying this branch is a straight, cylindrical vessel with laminar flow of a Newtonian fluid and that systemic autoregulation maintains a constant pressure drop across the collateral. The vessel length and blood viscosity remain unchanged during an acute vasodilatory response, so the only parameter that can change is the vessel radius. Starting from the Hagen–Poiseuille law for laminar flow in a cylindrical tube and using the described physiological constraints, determine the minimal fractional increase in collateral vessel radius required to double the volumetric flow to the affected MCA cortical branch.\n\nExpress your final answer as a decimal fraction without a percent sign, and round your answer to four significant figures.",

This process is not guesswork; it is a sophisticated form of logical inference where clinicians weigh the probability of different anatomical locations against the patient's specific symptoms.

            "problem": "A patient presents with a constellation of deficits consistent with brainstem localization: contralateral pure motor hemiparesis without sensory loss, ipsilateral horizontal gaze palsy consistent with involvement of the abducens nucleus, and dysarthria. The medial (paramedian) pontine region supplied by paramedian perforators of the basilar artery contains the corticospinal tract and the abducens nucleus and is classically implicated in such a pattern, whereas the lateral pontine region supplied by circumferential branches more commonly affects spinothalamic and trigeminal systems resulting in sensory deficits rather than isolated motor signs.\n\nFrom a curated registry of basilar artery territory ischemic events, the prior occlusion rates of pontine branches are as follows: paramedian pontine penetrating branches, $14$ per $1000$ events; circumferential pontine branches, $26$ per $1000$ events.

This exercise provides a powerful example of this principle by connecting a specific vascular lesion—an infarct in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery—to its precise consequence for vision. Using a mathematical model of the retinotopic map in the primary visual cortex, you will calculate the exact portion of the visual field lost due to a defined area of cortical damage.

This fraction, $F$, is the ratio of the lost visual field area, $A_{\\mathrm{lost}}$, to the total area of the contralateral hemifield, $A_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the cortical distance from the occipital pole, $s$, and the visual eccentricity, $e$.
