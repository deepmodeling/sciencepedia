            "problem": "A near-term fetus depends on placental gas exchange, with oxygenated blood returning to the fetus via the umbilical vein. Consider a fetus with hemoglobin (Hb) concentration $[\\text{Hb}] = 16\\,\\text{g/dL}$, an umbilical venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation $S_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.75$, and an umbilical venous partial pressure of oxygen $P_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$. The volume flow in the umbilical vein (placental venous return to the fetus) is $400\\,\\text{mL/min}$. After birth, umbilical flow ceases due to functional closure of the umbilical vessels, but before birth it represents the dominant source of oxygen delivery to the fetal systemic circulation.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of oxygen content and delivery grounded in well-tested physiological facts, where hemoglobin-bound oxygen depends on $[\\text{Hb}]$, $S_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, and the hemoglobin oxygen-carrying capacity, and dissolved oxygen depends on $P_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$ and the solubility of oxygen in plasma, compute the net rate of oxygen delivered to the fetus via the umbilical vein before birth.\n\nAssume the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin is $1.34\\,\\text{mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}$ and the solubility of oxygen in plasma is $0.003\\,\\text{mL O}_2/(\\text{dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg})$.

All necessary data are provided, and the values are physiologically plausible for a near-term fetus. The question asks for a calculation based on fundamental principles of respiratory gas transport, which is a standard procedure in physiology. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be computed.\n\nThe net rate of oxygen delivered to the fetus via the umbilical vein, which we will denote as $\\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, is calculated by multiplying the total oxygen content of the blood in the umbilical vein ($C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$) by the volume flow rate of blood in that vessel ($\\dot{Q}$).\n$$ \\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times \\dot{Q} $$\nThe total oxygen content ($C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$) is the sum of two components: the oxygen that is chemically bound to hemoglobin and the oxygen that is physically dissolved in the plasma.\n\n1.  **Oxygen Bound to Hemoglobin:**\n    This component is calculated as the product of the hemoglobin concentration, $[\\text{Hb}]$, the specific oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin, and the hemoglobin oxygen saturation, $S_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n    The problem provides the following values:\n    - Hemoglobin concentration: $[\\text{Hb}] = 16\\,\\text{g/dL}$\n    - Oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin: $k_{\\text{Hb}} = 1.34\\,\\text{mL O}_2/\\text{g Hb}$\n    - Umbilical venous hemoglobin oxygen saturation: $S_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.75$\n\n    The concentration of hemoglobin-bound oxygen ($C_{\\mathrm{Hb-O}_2}$) is therefore:\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb-O}_2} = [\\text{Hb}] \\times k_{\\text{Hb}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{O}_2} $$\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb-O}_2} = 16\\,\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{dL}} \\times 1.34\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{g}} \\times 0.75 $$\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{Hb-O}_2} = 16.08\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\n2.  **Dissolved Oxygen:**\n    This component is determined by Henry's Law, which states that the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure in the fluid. The constant of proportionality is the solubility of the gas.\n    The problem provides:\n    - Solubility of oxygen in plasma: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.003\\,\\text{mL O}_2/(\\text{dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg})$\n    - Umbilical venous partial pressure of oxygen: $P_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 35\\,\\text{mmHg}$\n\n    The concentration of dissolved oxygen ($C_{\\mathrm{diss-O}_2}$) is:\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{diss-O}_2} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{O}_2} \\times P_{\\mathrm{O}_2} $$\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{diss-O}_2} = 0.003\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}} \\times 35\\,\\text{mmHg} $$\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{diss-O}_2} = 0.105\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\n3.  **Total Oxygen Content:**\n    The total oxygen content, $C_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, is the sum of the bound and dissolved components.\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{\\mathrm{Hb-O}_2} + C_{\\mathrm{diss-O}_2} $$\n    $$ C_{\\mathrm{O}_2} = 16.08\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} + 0.105\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} = 16.185\\,\\frac{\\text{mL O}_2}{\\text{dL}} $$\n\n4.  **Net Rate of Oxygen Delivery:**\n    Finally, we calculate the rate of oxygen delivery, $\\dot{D}_{\\mathrm{O}_2}$, using the total oxygen content and the given umbilical vein flow rate, $\\dot{Q} = 400\\,\\text{mL/min}$.
