A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires finding the tensile load, or force $F$, at the onset of yielding. The fundamental relationship connecting normal stress $\\sigma$, force $F$, and cross-sectional area $A$ is given by the definition of stress:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{F}{A} $$\nTo find the force $F$, this equation is rearranged:\n$$ F = \\sigma \\cdot A $$\nThe problem provides the axial stress at yielding, $\\sigma = 2.10 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. The cross-sectional area $A$ must be calculated from the given diameter $d$.\n\nThe hair's cross-section is stated to be approximately circular. Using basic Euclidean geometry, the area $A$ of a circle with radius $r$ is:\n$$ A = \\pi r^2 $$\nThe radius $r$ is half of the diameter $d$:\n$$ r = \\frac{d}{2} $$\nSubstituting this into the area formula gives the area in terms of the diameter:\n$$ A = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} $$\nThe given diameter is $d = 80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. To maintain consistency with the SI units of stress (Pascals, which are $\\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2$), the diameter must be converted from micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n$$ 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nTherefore, the diameter in meters is:\n$$ d = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nNow, the cross-sectional area $A$ can be calculated:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\pi (80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi (6400 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)}{4} = 1600\\pi \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $A = 1.6\\pi \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nWith the stress $\\sigma$ and area $A$ known, the force $F$ can be calculated:\n$$ F = \\sigma \\cdot A = (2.10 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) \\cdot (1600\\pi \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) $$\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2$:\n$$ F = (2.10 \\times 10^{8}\\ \\mathrm{N}/\\mathrm{m}^2) \\cdot (1600\\pi \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) $$\nThe units $\\mathrm{m}^2$ cancel, leaving the force in newtons ($\\mathrm{N}$).\n$$ F = (2.10 \\times 10^{8}) \\cdot (1600\\pi \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F = (2.10) \\cdot (1.6 \\times 10^{3}) \\cdot \\pi \\cdot (10^{8} \\times 10^{-12})\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F = (2.10 \\times 1.6) \\cdot \\pi \\times 10^{3+8-12}\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F = 3.36 \\pi \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{N} = 0.336\\pi\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ F \\approx 0.336 \\times 3.14159265... \\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F \\approx 1.0555875...\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1.05$. The fourth significant digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the third digit.\n$$ F \\approx 1.06\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\nThe tensile load at the onset of yielding is $1.06\\ \\mathrm{N}$.",

It contains no inconsistencies, missing information, or other logical flaws.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Steady-State Probabilities**\n\nLet $p_{A}$, $p_{C}$, and $p_{T}$ be the steady-state probabilities of a hair follicle being in the anagen, catagen, and telogen states, respectively. According to the problem statement, we must use the principle that at steady state, the total probability flux into any given state must equal the total probability flux out of that same state. The probability flux from a state $X$ to a state $Y$ is given by the product of the probability of being in state $X$, $p_X$, and the transition rate from $X$ to $Y$, $k_{XY}$.\n\nThe system of balance equations is derived by considering each state:\n\n1.  For state $A$ (Anagen):\n    - The flux into state $A$ is from state $T$: $p_{T} k_{TA}$.\n    - The flux out of state $A$ is to state $C$: $p_{A} k_{AC}$.\n    - Equating these fluxes gives the balance equation for state $A$:\n    $$p_{T} k_{TA} = p_{A} k_{AC}$$\n\n2.  For state $C$ (Catagen):\n    - The flux into state $C$ is from state $A$: $p_{A} k_{AC}$.\n    - The flux out of state $C$ is to state $T$: $p_{C} k_{CT}$.\n    - Equating these fluxes gives the balance equation for state $C$:\n    $$p_{A} k_{AC} = p_{C} k_{CT}$$\n\n3.  For state $T$ (Telogen):\n    - The flux into state $T$ is from state $C$: $p_{C} k_{CT}$.\n    - The flux out of state $T$ is to state $A$: $p_{T} k_{TA}$.\n    - Equating these fluxes gives the balance equation for state $T$:\n    $$p_{C} k_{CT} = p_{T} k_{TA}$$\n\nNotice that these three equations are linearly dependent. Any one of them can be derived from the other two. For example, from the first two equations, we have $p_{T} k_{TA} = p_{A} k_{AC}$ and $p_{A} k_{AC} = p_{C} k_{CT}$, which implies $p_{T} k_{TA} = p_{C} k_{CT}$, the third equation. Therefore, we will use the first two independent equations and the normalization condition.\n\nThe normalization condition states that the sum of all steady-state probabilities must equal $1$:\n$$p_{A} + p_{C} + p_{T} = 1$$\n\nWe now have a system of three linear equations with three unknowns ($p_{A}$, $p_{C}$, $p_{T}$). We can solve this system by expressing $p_C$ and $p_T$ in terms of $p_A$.\n\nFrom the balance equation for state $A$, we solve for $p_{T}$:\n$$p_{T} = p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{TA}}$$\n\nFrom the balance equation for state $C$, we solve for $p_{C}$:\n$$p_{C} = p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{CT}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $p_{C}$ and $p_{T}$ into the normalization equation:\n$$p_{A} + \\left(p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{CT}}\\right) + \\left(p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{TA}}\\right) = 1$$\n\nFactor out $p_{A}$:\n$$p_{A} \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{CT}} + \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{TA}}\\right) = 1$$\n\nTo solve for $p_{A}$, we first combine the terms in the parenthesis over a common denominator, which is $k_{CT} k_{TA}$:\n$$p_{A} \\left(\\frac{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}{k_{CT} k_{TA}}\\right) = 1$$\n\nIsolating $p_{A}$ gives its steady-state probability:\n$$p_{A} = \\frac{k_{CT} k_{TA}}{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}$$\n\nNow we can find $p_{C}$ and $p_{T}$ by substituting this expression for $p_A$ back into our earlier relations.\n\nFor $p_{C}$:\n$$p_{C} = p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{CT}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{CT} k_{TA}}{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}\\right) \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{CT}}$$\nThe $k_{CT}$ term cancels, yielding:\n$$p_{C} = \\frac{k_{AC} k_{TA}}{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}$$\n\nFor $p_{T}$:\n$$p_{T} = p_{A} \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{TA}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{CT} k_{TA}}{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}\\right) \\frac{k_{AC}}{k_{TA}}$$\nThe $k_{TA}$ term cancels, yielding:\n$$p_{T} = \\frac{k_{AC} k_{CT}}{k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}}$$\n\nThe steady-state probability vector $(p_{A}, p_{C}, p_{T})$ is therefore given by these three expressions, which share a common denominator. Let this denominator be $D = k_{CT} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{TA} + k_{AC} k_{CT}$. The solution is:\n$$p_{A} = \\frac{k_{CT} k_{TA}}{D}$$\n$$p_{C} = \\frac{k_{AC} k_{TA}}{D}$$\n$$p_{T} = \\frac{k_{AC} k_{CT}}{D}$$\nThis is the final, simplified, closed-form solution.",
