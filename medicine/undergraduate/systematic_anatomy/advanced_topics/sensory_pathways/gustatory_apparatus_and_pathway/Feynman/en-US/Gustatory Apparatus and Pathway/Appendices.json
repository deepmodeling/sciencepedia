Use the following well-tested anatomical facts as your starting point: Type II cells of the gustatory epithelium are receptor cells for sweet, umami, and bitter stimuli and release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via non-synaptic mechanisms to activate primary gustatory afferents; Type III cells form conventional synapses with gustatory afferents and release serotonin as a principal transmitter; Type I and basal cells do not make a primary transmitter contribution to afferent synaptic drive.

The cell proportions are biologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a complete set of data and a clear objective. The total cell count and the percentages for the relevant cell types are given. The instruction to \"infer the expected composition... as the ratio of ... contributions,\" combined with the provided assumptions, directs the solver to a specific calculation. The most direct and logical interpretation, given the absence of information on the relative signaling strength per cell across different types, is that the ratio of contributions is to be modeled as the ratio of the number of contributing cells. This simplification is a common feature of quantitative problems in biology designed to test proportional reasoning. With this reasonable interpretation, a unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using factual, unbiased language. All necessary assumptions for the calculation are explicitly provided.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet $N_{\\text{total}}$ be the total number of cells in the taste bud, given as $N_{\\text{total}} = 80$.\nLet $P_{\\text{II}}$ and $P_{\\text{III}}$ be the percentages of Type II and Type III cells, respectively.\n$P_{\\text{II}} = 25\\% = 0.25$\n$P_{\\text{III}} = 15\\% = 0.15$\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the number of ATP-releasing cells and the number of serotonin-releasing cells, and then the ratio of their contributions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of Type II cells, $N_{\\text{II}}$, which are identified as the ATP-releasing cells.\n$$N_{\\text{II}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times P_{\\text{II}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{II}} = 80 \\times 0.25 = 20$$\nSo, there are $20$ ATP-releasing cells.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of Type III cells, $N_{\\text{III}}$, which are identified as the serotonin-releasing cells.\n$$N_{\\text{III}} = N_{\\text{total}} \\times P_{\\text{III}}$$\n$$N_{\\text{III}} = 80 \\times 0.15 = 12$$\nSo, there are $12$ serotonin-releasing cells.\n\nThe problem states that Type I and basal cells do not make a primary transmitter contribution, so they are not considered in the output ratio.\n\nThe final task is to infer the ratio of ATP-mediated to serotonin-mediated contributions. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{ATP-mediated contribution}}{\\text{serotonin-mediated contribution}}$$\n\nThe problem includes the assumption that each cell of a given type contributes equally to its respective transmitter output. Let $c_{\\text{ATP}}$ be the contribution of a single Type II cell and $c_{\\text{sero}}$ be the contribution of a single Type III cell.\nThe total ATP contribution is $N_{\\text{II}} \\times c_{\\text{ATP}}$.\nThe total serotonin contribution is $N_{\\text{III}} \\times c_{\\text{sero}}$.\nThus, the ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{N_{\\text{II}} \\times c_{\\text{ATP}}}{N_{\\text{III}} \\times c_{\\text{sero}}}$$\n\nThe problem does not provide the values for $c_{\\text{ATP}}$ and $c_{\\text{sero}}$ or their ratio. The wording \"infer the expected composition... as the ratio of ... contributions\" using *only* the base facts and given proportions implies that the ratio of contributions is to be taken as directly proportional to the number of cells of each type. This is equivalent to assuming that the average signaling contribution per cell is the same for both types, i.e., $c_{\\text{ATP}} = c_{\\text{sero}}$. Under this necessary simplifying assumption, the constants cancel out, and the ratio of contributions becomes the ratio of the number of contributing cells.\n\n$$R = \\frac{N_{\\text{II}}}{N_{\\text{III}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated cell numbers:\n$$R = \\frac{20}{12}$$\n\nTo provide the answer as a simplified, reduced fraction, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. The greatest common divisor of $20$ and $12$ is $4$.\n$$R = \\frac{20 \\div 4}{12 \\div 4} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\n\nThe expected composition of afferent synaptic output, expressed as the ratio of ATP-mediated to serotonin-mediated contributions, is $\\frac{5}{3}$.",

            "problem": "A gustatory stimulus applied to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue activates taste receptor cells that synapse onto primary afferent fibers traveling in the facial nerve pathway to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). From the NTS, gustatory information ascends via the central tegmental tract to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus, parvicellular part, and then reaches the primary gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum via thalamocortical projections.

This total latency, denoted as $T_{total}$, is the sum of two components: the total time spent traversing the nerve fiber segments (conduction time) and the total time lost due to synaptic transmission (synaptic delay).\n\nThe total latency can be expressed as:\n$$T_{total} = T_{cond} + T_{syn}$$\nwhere $T_{cond}$ is the total conduction time and $T_{syn}$ is the total synaptic delay.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total synaptic delay, $T_{syn}$. The problem states there are $N_{syn} = 3$ synapses in the pathway, each contributing a fixed delay of $t_{syn} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The total synaptic delay is therefore the product of the number of synapses and the delay per synapse:\n$$T_{syn} = N_{syn} \\times t_{syn} = 3 \\times 2\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 6\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total conduction time, $T_{cond}$. The pathway is modeled as three serial segments. The total conduction time is the sum of the individual conduction times for each segment, $t_1$, $t_2$, and $t_3$:\n$$T_{cond} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3$$\nThe conduction time for any given segment $i$ is calculated by dividing the path length $L_i$ by the conduction velocity $v_i$:\n$$t_i = \\frac{L_i}{v_i}$$\n\nThe parameters for the three segments are given as:\n1.

Thalamocortical path: $L_3 = 40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $v_3 = 20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n\nTo perform the calculations correctly, all units must be consistent. We will convert all lengths to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) and velocities to meters per second ($\\mathrm{m/s}$), which will yield time in seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n\nUnit conversions for the lengths:\n$L_1 = 12\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 12 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_2 = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 30 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$L_3 = 40\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 40 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nNow, we calculate the conduction time for each segment in seconds:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{L_1}{v_1} = \\frac{0.12\\,\\mathrm{m}}{15\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$t_2 = \\frac{L_2}{v_2} = \\frac{0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}}{20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$t_3 = \\frac{L_3}{v_3} = \\frac{0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}}{20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.002\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe total conduction time, $T_{cond}$, is the sum of these individual times:\n$$T_{cond} = t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{s} + 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{s} + 0.002\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.0115\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$).

The classification of taste receptor cells into Type $I$, $II$, and $III$ is standard. The described transduction pathways for the different taste modalities are consistent with current scientific consensus: sweet, umami, and bitter via Type $II$ cells involving GPCRs, PLC$\\beta$ $2$, and ATP release; sour via Type $III$ cells involving proton channels (OTOP$1$). The use of specific molecular markers (PLC$\\beta$ $2$ for Type $II$, PKD$2$L$1$ for Type $III$) to confirm the genetic ablation is a valid and common experimental approach. The anatomical detail (chorda tympani innervating the anterior tongue) is correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It describes a clear initial state (baseline recordings), a specific, well-defined intervention (selective ablation of Type $II$ cells), and asks for a predictable outcome based on a provided set of foundational facts. The setup allows for a unique, logical deduction.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative (stimulus concentrations), and free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the following flaws:\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness**: The premises are factually sound and reflect current models in the field.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is a direct test of knowledge in systematic anatomy and physiology, specifically the gustatory system.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem provides all necessary information. The histological confirmation (loss of PLC$\\beta$ $2$ cells, preservation of PKD$2$L$1$ cells) aligns perfectly with the stated intervention (ablation of Type $II$ cells, sparing of Type $III$ cells).\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: Selective cell ablation using genetic techniques is a standard and feasible experimental paradigm in modern biology.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: A unique solution can be logically derived from the given principles.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires genuine application of physiological principles to a specific experimental scenario.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The experimental outcome is, in principle, verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n## DERIVATION OF SOLUTION\n\nThe problem asks to predict the pattern of nerve activity in the chorda tympani following the selective ablation of Type $II$ taste receptor cells (TRCs). The solution can be derived by applying the provided foundational facts to the experimental conditions.\n\n1.  **Identify the functions of the ablated cells**: The problem states that Type $II$ TRCs are ablated. The foundational facts specify that Type $II$ cells are responsible for transducing sweet, umami, and bitter stimuli. The transduction cascade involves GPCRs, PLC signaling (the marker for these cells is PLC$\\beta$ $2$), and eventual release of ATP as a neurotransmitter to excite afferent nerve fibers of the chorda tympani.\n\n2.  **Predict the consequence of ablating Type II cells**: Since the cells that perform the initial detection and signal transduction for sweet, umami, and bitter tastes are eliminated, the nervous system will no longer receive a signal when these stimuli are applied to the tongue. The application of sucrose (sweet), monosodium glutamate + inosine monophosphate (umami), and denatonium benzoate (bitter) will fail to elicit a response in the gustatory afferent nerves. Therefore, the compound nerve activity recorded from the chorda tympani in response to these three stimuli should be abolished, or reduced to the level of spontaneous baseline activity.\n\n3.  **Identify the functions of the spared cells**: The problem states that Type $III$ presynaptic cells are spared. This is confirmed by the preservation of PKD$2$L$1$-positive cells, a marker for this cell type. The foundational facts specify that Type $III$ cells are responsible for transducing the sour modality. The mechanism involves proton entry through OTOP$1$ channels and communication with nerve fibers via conventional synaptic vesicle release.\n\n4.  **Predict the consequence of sparing Type III cells**: Since the cells responsible for sour taste transduction (Type $III$ cells) and their downstream signaling machinery are intact, the application of hydrochloric acid (sour) should still evoke a response. As the problem states that other conditions remain unchanged, the response to sour stimuli should be largely preserved, remaining comparable in its characteristics (e.g., amplitude, latency) to the pre-ablation recordings.\n\n5.  **Synthesize the final prediction**: The selective ablation of Type $II$ TRCs will lead to a loss of nerve responses to sweet, umami, and bitter stimuli, while the response to sour stimuli will be preserved.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Near abolition (marked reduction toward baseline) of responses to sweet, umami, and bitter, with sour responses remaining comparable in amplitude and latency to pre-ablation values.**\nThis option aligns perfectly with the derivation. The loss of Type $II$ cells removes the transduction mechanism for sweet, umami, and bitter. The preservation of Type $III$ cells maintains the transduction mechanism for sour. Thus, responses to the first three modalities are abolished, while the sour response persists.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Selective loss of sour responses, with preserved sweet, umami, and bitter, because Type II cells provide ATP that is obligatory for all taste modalities.**\nThis option incorrectly assigns the roles of the cell types. Sour is transduced by Type $III$ cells, not Type $II$. Sweet, umami, and bitter are transduced by Type $II$ cells. Therefore, ablating Type $II$ cells would affect the latter three, not sour. The claim that ATP from Type $II$ cells is obligatory for all modalities is not supported by the foundational facts, which describe a separate pathway for sour transduction in Type $III$ cells.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Global reduction of all four modalities due to removal of Type I glial support, even though Type II cells are the only population ablated.**\nThis option contradicts a key premise of the problem. The problem statement explicitly says the intervention spares \"Type $I$ supporting cells\". Therefore, the reason provided (\"removal of Type $I$ glial support\") is factually incorrect within the context of the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Sweet and umami responses remain robust because central circuits compensate, bitter responses diminish due to trigeminal activation being absent in chorda tympani recordings, and sour is unchanged.**\nThis option introduces several incorrect lines of reasoning. First, \"central circuit compensation\" is irrelevant to recordings from a peripheral nerve (chorda tympani). Compensation occurs in the brain, not at the primary afferent level. Second, it makes an arbitrary distinction between sweet/umami and bitter, whereas the provided facts state all three are transduced by the same cell type (Type $II$) and would therefore be equally affected by their ablation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Bitter responses persist via nociceptive free endings, while sweet and umami responses are lost; sour responses are enhanced due to removal of purinergic inhibition from Type II cells.**\nThis option makes unsubstantiated claims. While some chemicals can activate nociceptors, the primary *taste* response to denatonium, an archetypal bitter compound, is mediated by Type $II$ cells. The ablation of these cells should abolish the bitter taste signal recorded in the chorda tympani. The claim of sour enhancement due to removal of purinergic inhibition is a hypothesis about lateral interactions not included in the provided foundational facts. The most parsimonious prediction based on the given principles is preservation, not enhancement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
