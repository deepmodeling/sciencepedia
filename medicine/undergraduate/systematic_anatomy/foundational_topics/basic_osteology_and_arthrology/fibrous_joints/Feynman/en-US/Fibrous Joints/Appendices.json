            "problem": "A fibrous joint known as a gomphosis connects a tooth to its alveolar bone via the periodontal ligament (PDL), whose principal fiber groups include the oblique fibers. In a controlled mastication simulation, an instantaneous tensile load of magnitude $F=120\\,\\mathrm{N}$ is borne by the oblique fiber group across an effective load-bearing area $A=25\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$, defined as the sum of cross-sectional areas of engaged collagen bundles aligned within an oblique trajectory and transmitting tension at the time of measurement.

The description of the PDL's oblique fibers, the magnitude of the force (a reasonable bite force), and the effective area are all plausible within the context of dental biomechanics. The provided stress tolerance range is consistent with established literature on the mechanical properties of ligamentous tissues.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data ($F$ and $A$) and a clear formula ($\\sigma = F/A$) to compute a unique solution for the stress. The requirements for units (MPa) and significant figures are explicitly stated, removing ambiguity.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. The quantities are defined, and the task is a direct computation followed by an interpretation based on a supplied, objective criterion. It is free from subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with a complete and consistent setup. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the average tensile stress, $\\sigma$, in the oblique fiber group of the periodontal ligament. The fundamental definition of average normal stress is provided as the force, $F$, applied perpendicularly to an area, $A$.\n\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}\n$$\n\nThe given values are an applied load of $F = 120\\,\\mathrm{N}$ and an effective load-bearing area of $A = 25\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{120\\,\\mathrm{N}}{25\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}}\n$$\n\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$\n\\sigma = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in units of megapascals (MPa). We must perform a unit conversion. The definition of a Pascal (Pa) is $1\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$. A megapascal is $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nTo convert from $\\mathrm{N/mm^2}$ to $\\mathrm{MPa}$, we establish the relationship between $\\mathrm{mm^2}$ and $\\mathrm{m^2}$:\n$1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = (10^3\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}\n$$\nTherefore, $1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n\nSubstituting this into our calculated stress unit:\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{N}}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThis establishes the direct equivalence: $1\\,\\mathrm{N/mm^2} = 1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThus, the calculated stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma = 4.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThe final step in the calculation is to adhere to the specified precision of three significant figures. The value $4.8$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a trailing zero.\n$$\n\\sigma = 4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret this result. The computed stress is $\\sigma = 4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The problem states that such tissues \"typically tolerate single-episode physiological tensile stresses in the single-digit megapascals before microfailure becomes likely\".\n\nThe term \"single-digit megapascals\" refers to the range from $1\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ up to, but not including, $10\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$. The calculated stress of $4.80\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ falls squarely within this range. It is not an insignificant value; it is approximately half of the maximum value in this nominal tolerance band. Therefore, the computed stress represents a substantial load condition that approaches the physiological stress limits of the tissue. While it may not cause immediate, catastrophic failure, it is high enough that repeated or sustained application could lead to the onset of microfailure, inflammation, and tissue remodeling, consistent with biomechanical principles of tissue adaptation and injury.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of linear elasticity, a fundamental theory in continuum mechanics. The provided data ($E = 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$, $\\nu = 0.3$) are physically realistic for stiff biological tissue. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient information to derive the requested relationship and compute a unique numerical answer. The terminology is precise and objective. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the shear modulus, $G$, in terms of Young's modulus, $E$, and Poisson's ratio, $\\nu$, for a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic material. We will then use this expression to calculate the value of $G$. The derivation will proceed by analyzing a state of pure shear.\n\nConsider a small element of the material subjected to a state of pure shear in the $xy$-plane, characterized by a shear stress $\\tau$. The stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, in the $xyz$ coordinate system is:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\tau & 0 \\\\ \\tau & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nBy definition, the shear modulus $G$ relates this shear stress $\\tau$ to the resulting engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$:\n$$ G = \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma_{xy}} $$\nThe engineering shear strain $\\gamma_{xy}$ is related to the tensor strain components $\\epsilon_{xy}$ and $\\epsilon_{yx}$ by $\\gamma_{xy} = \\epsilon_{xy} + \\epsilon_{yx}$. For an isotropic material, $\\epsilon_{xy} = \\epsilon_{yx}$, so $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\epsilon_{xy}$.\n\nA state of pure shear is equivalent to a state of tension and compression of equal magnitude on planes oriented at $45^\\circ$ to the planes of shear. To demonstrate this, we find the principal stresses by rotating the coordinate system. The principal stresses, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$, are the eigenvalues of the stress tensor. For the given stress state, the characteristic equation is:\n$$ \\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\sigma \\mathbf{I}) = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\sigma & \\tau & 0 \\\\ \\tau & -\\sigma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -\\sigma \\end{pmatrix} = -\\sigma(\\sigma^2 - \\tau^2) = 0 $$\nThe roots are $\\sigma_3 = 0$, $\\sigma_1 = \\tau$, and $\\sigma_2 = -\\tau$. This confirms that the pure shear state is equivalent to a tensile stress $\\tau$ and a compressive stress $-\\tau$ in the principal directions. The corresponding principal axes are rotated by $\\pm 45^\\circ$ from the original axes.\n\nNow, we can express the strain in the direction of the principal stress $\\sigma_1$ using the generalized Hooke's law for an isotropic material. The strain $\\epsilon_1$ along the principal direction of $\\sigma_1$ is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_1 = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_1 - \\nu(\\sigma_2 + \\sigma_3)) $$\nSubstituting the values of the principal stresses, $\\sigma_1 = \\tau$, $\\sigma_2 = -\\tau$, and $\\sigma_3 = 0$:\n$$ \\epsilon_1 = \\frac{1}{E}(\\tau - \\nu(-\\tau + 0)) = \\frac{\\tau}{E}(1 + \\nu) $$\n\nNext, we relate this principal strain $\\epsilon_1$ to the shear strain components in the original $xy$-coordinate system using strain transformation equations. The strain $\\epsilon_{x'}$ in a coordinate system rotated by an angle $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_{x'} = \\epsilon_x \\cos^2\\theta + \\epsilon_y \\sin^2\\theta + 2\\epsilon_{xy} \\sin\\theta \\cos\\theta $$\nIn a state of pure shear, the normal strains $\\epsilon_x$ and $\\epsilon_y$ are zero. The principal direction for $\\sigma_1 = \\tau$ corresponds to an angle $\\theta = 45^\\circ$. Thus, the principal strain $\\epsilon_1$ is equal to $\\epsilon_{x'}$ at $\\theta = 45^\\circ$:\n$$ \\epsilon_1 = \\epsilon_{x'}|_{\\theta=45^\\circ} = 2\\epsilon_{xy} \\sin(45^\\circ) \\cos(45^\\circ) = 2\\epsilon_{xy} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\epsilon_{xy} $$\nSince the engineering shear strain is $\\gamma_{xy} = 2\\epsilon_{xy}$, we have $\\epsilon_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_{xy}}{2}$.\n\nWe now have two expressions for the principal strain $\\epsilon_1$:\n1. From Hooke's law in terms of principal stresses: $\\epsilon_1 = \\frac{\\tau}{E}(1 + \\nu)$\n2. From strain transformation: $\\epsilon_1 = \\frac{\\gamma_{xy}}{2}$\n\nEquating these two expressions gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma_{xy}}{2} = \\frac{\\tau}{E}(1 + \\nu) $$\nRearranging this equation to find the ratio of shear stress to shear strain:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma_{xy}} = \\frac{E}{2(1 + \\nu)} $$\nBy definition, $G = \\frac{\\tau}{\\gamma_{xy}}$. Therefore, we have derived the relationship:\n$$ G = \\frac{E}{2(1 + \\nu)} $$\nThis is the required expression for the shear modulus in terms of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $G$ using the given values $E = 600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $\\nu = 0.3$.\n$$ G = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{2(1 + 0.3)} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{2(1.3)} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{MPa}}{2.6} $$\n$$ G \\approx 230.76923...\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ G \\approx 230.8\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nFinally, a brief mechanistic explanation for the relevance of $G$ to torsional loads in a fibrous syndesmosis is as follows. Torsion is a twisting load. Mechanically, twisting an object, such as the forearm where the syndesmosis is located, induces shear stresses in the material. The interosseous membrane is oriented between the radius and ulna, and during pronation or supination of the forearm, these bones move relative to each other, subjecting the fibers of the membrane to a shearing deformation. The shear modulus, $G$, is the fundamental material property that quantifies a material's stiffness or resistance to this type of shearing deformation. It is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear strain. A higher value of $G$ indicates a stiffer material in shear, meaning it will deform less under a given torsional or shearing load. Therefore, for analyzing the mechanical response of the syndesmosis to forearm rotation, the shear modulus is the most direct and relevant elastic property.",
