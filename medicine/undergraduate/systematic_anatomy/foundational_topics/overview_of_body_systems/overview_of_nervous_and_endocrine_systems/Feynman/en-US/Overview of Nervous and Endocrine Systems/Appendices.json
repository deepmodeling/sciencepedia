            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Nernst equilibrium potential for potassium ($K^{+}$) ions across a neuronal membrane, starting from the principle of electrochemical equilibrium, followed by a numerical calculation and interpretation.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of thermodynamics and electrophysiology. All necessary data and constants ($[K]_{i}$, $[K]_{o}$, $T$, $z_{K}$, $R$, $F$) are provided, and their values are physiologically realistic. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. It requests a derivation from first principles, which is a standard procedure in physical chemistry and biophysics. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Equilibrium Potential**\n\nThe electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, of an ionic species $j$ in a solution is the sum of its chemical potential, $\\mu_j$, and the potential energy associated with its charge in an electric field, $z_j F \\psi$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j + z_j F \\psi $$\nHere, $z_j$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential of the solution.\n\nFor a dilute solution, the chemical potential can be expressed as:\n$$ \\mu_j = \\mu_j^0 + R T \\ln C_j $$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C_j$ is the molar concentration of the ion.\n\nCombining these two equations gives the full expression for the electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + R T \\ln C_j + z_j F \\psi $$\n\nWe apply this relationship to the potassium ions ($K^{+}$) in the intracellular (subscript $i$) and extracellular (subscript $o$) compartments of the neuron.\nThe electrochemical potential for potassium inside the cell is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{K,i} = \\mu_K^0 + R T \\ln [K]_i + z_K F \\psi_i $$\nAnd outside the cell:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{K,o} = \\mu_K^0 + R T \\ln [K]_o + z_K F \\psi_o $$\nIt is assumed that the standard chemical potential $\\mu_K^0$ is the same in both compartments.\n\nAt electrochemical equilibrium, the problem states that there is no net movement of the ion across the membrane. This occurs when the electrochemical potential is the same on both sides of the membrane:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{K,i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{K,o} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the electrochemical potentials:\n$$ \\mu_K^0 + R T \\ln [K]_i + z_K F \\psi_i = \\mu_K^0 + R T \\ln [K]_o + z_K F \\psi_o $$\nThe standard chemical potential term $\\mu_K^0$ cancels out:\n$$ R T \\ln [K]_i + z_K F \\psi_i = R T \\ln [K]_o + z_K F \\psi_o $$\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for the membrane potential difference, $\\Delta\\psi = \\psi_i - \\psi_o$, which is defined as the equilibrium potential for potassium, $E_K$.\n$$ z_K F \\psi_i - z_K F \\psi_o = R T \\ln [K]_o - R T \\ln [K]_i $$\n$$ z_K F (\\psi_i - \\psi_o) = R T (\\ln [K]_o - \\ln [K]_i) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$ z_K F E_K = R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K]_o}{[K]_i}\\right) $$\nFinally, isolating $E_K$ yields the Nernst equation for the potassium equilibrium potential:\n$$ E_K = \\frac{R T}{z_K F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[K]_o}{[K]_i}\\right) $$\nThis expression is the derived equilibrium potential for potassium.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived equation:\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $z_K = +1$\n- $F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n- $[K]_o = 4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n- $[K]_i = 140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\n$$ E_K = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(+1) \\times (96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{140\\,\\mathrm{mM}}\\right) $$\nThe concentration units ($\\mathrm{mM}$) cancel out. Note that the unit $\\mathrm{J/C}$ is equivalent to Volts ($\\mathrm{V}$).\n$$ E_K = \\frac{2577.34}{96485} \\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{140}\\right) $$\n$$ E_K \\approx 0.026713\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{35}\\right) $$\n$$ E_K \\approx 0.026713\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times (-\\ln(35)) $$\n$$ E_K \\approx 0.026713\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times (-3.555348) $$\n$$ E_K \\approx -0.094975\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer in millivolts ($mV$) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ E_K \\approx -94.975\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\n$$ E_K \\approx -95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\n\n**Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated equilibrium potential for potassium, $E_K$, is approximately $-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\n- **Sign**: The negative sign indicates that the inside of the cell must be negative with respect to the outside to achieve electrochemical equilibrium for potassium. The concentration of $K^+$ is much higher inside ($140\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) than outside ($4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$), creating a strong chemical gradient that drives $K^+$ out of the cell. The efflux of positive ions leaves a net negative charge on the inner side of the membrane. This creates an inwardly directed electrical gradient that opposes the further outward movement of $K^+$. The value of $-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is the precise electrical potential difference that exactly balances the chemical driving force.\n\n- **Magnitude and Context**: The magnitude of $-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ is significant. A typical neuron's resting membrane potential is around $-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The fact that $E_K$ is very close to the resting potential signifies that the neuronal membrane at rest is highly permeable to potassium ions. The resting potential is primarily established by potassium ions leaking out of the cell through \"leak\" channels, moving down their steep concentration gradient. The small difference between $E_K$ ($-95.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) and the typical resting potential ($-70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$) is due to the minor but non-zero permeability of the membrane to other ions, most notably sodium ($Na^+$), which has a positive equilibrium potential and leaks slowly into the cell, making the resting potential slightly more positive than $E_K$.",

The problem is a direct application of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) model for electrodiffusion across a cell membrane, a cornerstone of cellular electrophysiology.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state membrane potential, $V_m$, under conditions where the net ionic current across the membrane is zero. The given assumptions—specifically, the constant-field approximation—lead directly to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation. This equation relates the membrane potential to the concentrations and permeabilities of the ions to which the membrane is permeable.\n\nThe GHK voltage equation for a system of monovalent cations and anions is:\n$$V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i} P_{C_i^+} [C_i^+]_o + \\sum_{j} P_{A_j^-} [A_j^-]_i}{\\sum_{i} P_{C_i^+} [C_i^+]_i + \\sum_{j} P_{A_j^-} [A_j^-]_o} \\right)$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $P_{ion}$ is the membrane permeability for a given ion, $[ion]_o$ is the extracellular concentration, and $[ion]_i$ is the intracellular concentration.

Note the inverted position of intracellular and extracellular concentrations for the anions ($A_j^-$), which arise from their negative charge.\n\nThe ions specified in the problem are potassium ($K^+$), sodium ($Na^+$), and chloride ($Cl^-$).
