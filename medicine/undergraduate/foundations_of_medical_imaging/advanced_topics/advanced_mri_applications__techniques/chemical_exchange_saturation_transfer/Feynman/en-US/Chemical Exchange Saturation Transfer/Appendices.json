This exercise introduces the Magnetization Transfer Ratio Asymmetry ($\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}$), a fundamental metric used to isolate the specific signal from exchanging protons by comparing the signal loss at symmetric positive and negative frequency offsets. By working through this problem, you will learn how to calculate this key metric from raw Z-spectrum data and begin to dissect how different biological phenomena, like amide proton transfer and the relayed Nuclear Overhauser Effect (rNOE), contribute to the final contrast .",

            "problem": "A chemical exchange saturation transfer experiment produces a Z-spectrum, defined by the ratio of the radiofrequency-saturated signal to the unsaturated baseline, $Z(\\Delta) = S_{\\mathrm{sat}}(\\Delta)/S_{0}$, where $\\Delta$ is the frequency offset in parts per million relative to water and $S_{0}$ is the equilibrium signal without saturation. The magnetization transfer ratio is defined as $\\mathrm{MTR}(\\Delta) = 1 - Z(\\Delta)$, which quantifies the saturation-induced signal loss at offset $\\Delta$. Using these definitions, construct an asymmetry metric between the downfield ($+\\Delta$) and upfield ($-\\Delta$) offsets by taking the difference of the magnetization transfer ratios, and evaluate it at $\\Delta = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ for measured values $Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.88$ and $Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.93$. Then, assuming that semi-solid magnetization transfer and direct water saturation form a symmetric background around water, approximate the symmetric baseline at $\\pm 3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$ by $Z_{\\mathrm{sym}} = \\big(Z(+\\Delta) + Z(-\\Delta)\\big)/2$, and use this to estimate the fraction of the asymmetry that can be attributed to the upfield relayed Nuclear Overhauser Effect (rNOE) at $-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. Express both the asymmetry and the fractional contribution as unitless decimals, and give the final numerical values without rounding instructions.",
            "solution": "The problem requires calculating two quantities: an asymmetry metric derived from the magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), and the fractional contribution of the upfield relayed Nuclear Overhauser Effect (rNOE) to this asymmetry.\n\nFirst, we define the asymmetry metric, which we will denote as $\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\Delta)$. It is defined as the difference of the MTRs at the downfield ($+\\Delta$) and upfield ($-\\Delta$) offsets:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\Delta) = \\mathrm{MTR}(+\\Delta) - \\mathrm{MTR}(-\\Delta) $$\nThe MTR itself is defined in terms of the Z-spectrum, $Z(\\Delta)$, as $\\mathrm{MTR}(\\Delta) = 1 - Z(\\Delta)$. Substituting this into the asymmetry definition gives an equivalent expression in terms of $Z$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(\\Delta) = (1 - Z(+\\Delta)) - (1 - Z(-\\Delta)) = Z(-\\Delta) - Z(+\\Delta) $$\nWe are given the values at the specific offset $\\Delta = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$:\n- $Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.88$\n- $Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.93$\n\nFirst, we calculate the MTR values at these offsets:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.88 = 0.12 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07 $$\nNow, we can calculate the asymmetry metric, which is the first required answer:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.12 - 0.07 = 0.05 $$\n\nNext, we must estimate the fraction of this asymmetry that is attributable to the upfield rNOE at $-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}$. The problem states that the background signal, composed of semi-solid magnetization transfer and direct water saturation, is symmetric. We can approximate this symmetric component of the Z-spectrum, $Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, by averaging the measured values at the positive and negative offsets:\n$$ Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = \\frac{Z(+3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) + Z(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm})}{2} = \\frac{0.88 + 0.93}{2} = \\frac{1.81}{2} = 0.905 $$\nThe corresponding symmetric MTR baseline, $\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}$, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - Z_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 1 - 0.905 = 0.095 $$\nThe total measured MTR at any offset is the sum of this symmetric baseline and an asymmetric component due to specific chemical exchange effects (like amide proton transfer) or rNOE. The asymmetric component of the MTR at the upfield offset, which is attributed to the rNOE, is the deviation of the measured MTR from the symmetric baseline:\n$$ \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}} = \\mathrm{MTR}(-3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) - \\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{sym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.07 - 0.095 = -0.025 $$\nThe magnitude of the rNOE's contribution to the asymmetry is the absolute value of this deviation:\n$$ |\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}| = |-0.025| = 0.025 $$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total asymmetry that this contribution represents. The total asymmetry metric was calculated as $\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm}) = 0.05$. The required fraction, $F_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}$, is the ratio of the magnitude of the rNOE contribution to the total asymmetry metric:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{rNOE}} = \\frac{|\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{rNOE}}|}{\\mathrm{MTR}_{\\mathrm{asym}}(3.5\\,\\mathrm{ppm})} = \\frac{0.025}{0.05} = 0.5 $$\nThis result signifies that the downfield amide effect and the upfield rNOE effect contributed equally in magnitude to the overall observed asymmetry. The downfield effect increases the MTR by $0.025$ relative to the symmetric baseline ($0.12 = 0.095 + 0.025$), while the upfield effect decreases the MTR by $0.025$ relative to the baseline ($0.07 = 0.095 - 0.025$). Their difference creates the total asymmetry of $0.05$.\n\nThe two required values are the asymmetry metric, $0.05$, and the fractional contribution from the rNOE, $0.5$.",
