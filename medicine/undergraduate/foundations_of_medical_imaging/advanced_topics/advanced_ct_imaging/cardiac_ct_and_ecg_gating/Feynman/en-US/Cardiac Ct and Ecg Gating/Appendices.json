It is a standard-form physics and engineering problem in the field of medical imaging. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the effective temporal resolution and the corresponding motion blur distance.\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective temporal resolution, $\\Delta t_{eff}$.\nThe gantry rotates at a constant angular speed, $\\omega$. The gantry completes a full rotation of $360^{\\circ}$ in the time $T$. The angular speed is therefore:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{T} $$\nThe problem states that for exact half-scan fan-beam reconstruction, a minimum angular range of projections, $\\Delta\\theta_{min}$, is required. This range is given by:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{min} = 180^{\\circ} + \\Phi $$\nWith the given full fan angle $\\Phi = 50^{\\circ}$, the minimum required angular range is:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_{min} = 180^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ} = 230^{\\circ} $$\nThe effective temporal resolution, $\\Delta t_{eff}$, is defined as the time required to acquire this angular range. Since the rotation is uniform, the time is the ratio of the required angle to the angular speed:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_{min}}{\\omega} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta\\theta_{min}$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{180^{\\circ} + \\Phi}{\\frac{360^{\\circ}}{T}} = T \\left( \\frac{180^{\\circ} + \\Phi}{360^{\\circ}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $T = 280\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\Phi = 50^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = (280\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\left( \\frac{180^{\\circ} + 50^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\right) = (280\\,\\mathrm{ms}) \\left( \\frac{230}{360} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = 280 \\times \\frac{23}{36}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{70 \\times 23}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{1610}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nThe numerical value is $\\Delta t_{eff} \\approx 178.888... \\,\\mathrm{ms}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} \\approx 178.9\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the motion blur distance, $d_{blur}$.\nThis is defined as the product of the object's speed, $v$, and the effective temporal resolution, $\\Delta t_{eff}$.\n$$ d_{blur} = v \\times \\Delta t_{eff} $$\nThe given speed is $v = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm/s}$. The calculated temporal resolution is $\\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{1610}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. To maintain consistent units, we must convert the time from milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$ \\Delta t_{eff} = \\frac{1610}{9}\\,\\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{1610}{9 \\times 1000}\\,\\mathrms = \\frac{161}{900}\\,\\mathrms $$\nNow we can calculate the blur distance:\n$$ d_{blur} = (20\\,\\mathrm{mm/s}) \\times \\left( \\frac{161}{900}\\,\\mathrms \\right) = \\frac{20 \\times 161}{900}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{161}{45}\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe numerical value is $d_{blur} \\approx 3.5777... \\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ d_{blur} \\approx 3.578\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\nThe requested answer is an ordered pair of the temporal resolution in $\\mathrm{ms}$ and the blur distance in $\\mathrm{mm}$, both rounded to four significant figures.\nThe pair is $[178.9, 3.578]$.",

            "introduction": "Simply acquiring data quickly is not enough; we must also acquire it at the right time, during phases of minimal cardiac motion. This exercise models a critical clinical decision: choosing the optimal phase within the cardiac cycle for image reconstruction based on patient physiology. By analyzing a simplified but insightful model of coronary artery speed , you will quantitatively determine a heart rate threshold that dictates whether diastolic or systolic gating is preferable, illuminating the logic behind adapting imaging protocols to individual patients.",

            "problem": "A coronary computed tomography angiography (CT) acquisition uses retrospective electrocardiogram (ECG) gating with half-scan reconstruction. The gantry rotation period is $T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0.280$ s, giving an effective exposure window duration $T_{w} = T_{\\mathrm{rot}}/2$. Let the cardiac cycle duration be $T_{c} = 60/H$ s, where $H$ is the heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).\n\nTo assess motion blur of a coronary segment, model the local coronary artery centerline speed near the quiescent phases as follows. In a small neighborhood around mid-diastole (time $t_{d}$), the speed is approximated by\n$$\nv_{d}(t;H) = a_{d}(H)\\,|t - t_{d}|, \\quad a_{d}(H) = \\alpha\\, H,\n$$\nand in a small neighborhood around mid-systole (time $t_{s}$), the speed is approximated by\n$$\nv_{s}(t;H) = a_{s}\\,|t - t_{s}|, \\quad a_{s} = \\beta,\n$$\nwith $t$ measured in seconds, and $v_{d}$ and $v_{s}$ in millimeters per second. The parameters are $\\alpha = 0.50$ mm s$^{-2}$ per bpm and $\\beta = 40.0$ mm s$^{-2}$. Assume that in each neighborhood the linear approximation holds over an interval that is wide compared to $T_{w}$ so that the exposure window is fully contained in the validity region.\n\nMotion blur for a reconstruction window of width $T_{w}$ centered at time $t_{0}$ is modeled as the magnitude of displacement during the window,\n$$\nB(t_{0};H) = \\int_{t_{0}-\\frac{T_{w}}{2}}^{t_{0}+\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} |v(t;H)|\\,\\mathrm{d}t.\n$$\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting from the definition of displacement as the time integral of speed, derive expressions for the motion blur when centering the window at mid-diastole and at mid-systole, denoted $B_{d}(H)$ and $B_{s}(H)$, respectively. Use only the models for $v_{d}$ and $v_{s}$ given above.\n2. Using your expressions, show how increasing $H$ shortens the effective diastolic quiescent interval by examining how the time span over which $|v_{d}(t;H)| \\le v_{q}$ depends on $H$ for a fixed small velocity threshold $v_{q} > 0$.\n3. Derive the threshold heart rate $H^{\\ast}$ at which mid-systolic gating becomes preferable to mid-diastolic gating in the sense that $B_{s}(H^{\\ast}) = B_{d}(H^{\\ast})$, and mid-systole yields smaller blur for $H > H^{\\ast}$. Compute the numerical value of $H^{\\ast}$ using the supplied parameters. Round your final heart rate to three significant figures. Express the final heart rate in beats per minute (bpm).",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid based on the provided criteria. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The model, while a simplification of complex physiological motion, is a standard and appropriate representation for this type of analysis in medical imaging physics.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the three tasks in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish the values of the given constants.\nThe gantry rotation period is $T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0.280$ s.\nThe effective exposure window duration is $T_{w} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{rot}}}{2} = \\frac{0.280 \\text{ s}}{2} = 0.140$ s.\nThe model parameters are $\\alpha = 0.50$ mm s$^{-2}$ per bpm and $\\beta = 40.0$ mm s$^{-2}$.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Motion Blur Expressions**\n\nThe motion blur, $B$, for a reconstruction window of width $T_{w}$ centered at time $t_{0}$ is defined as the total displacement during the exposure:\n$$B(t_{0};H) = \\int_{t_{0}-\\frac{T_{w}}{2}}^{t_{0}+\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} |v(t;H)|\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nSince the given velocity models $v_d(t;H)$ and $v_s(t;H)$ represent speed, they are already non-negative. Thus, the absolute value on $v(t;H)$ can be removed.\n\nFor a window centered at mid-diastole ($t_{0} = t_{d}$), the velocity is given by $v_d(t;H) = a_d(H) |t - t_d|$, where $a_d(H) = \\alpha H$. The motion blur, $B_{d}(H)$, is:\n$$B_{d}(H) = \\int_{t_{d}-\\frac{T_{w}}{2}}^{t_{d}+\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} \\alpha H |t - t_{d}|\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = t - t_{d}$. Then $\\mathrm{d}u = \\mathrm{d}t$. When $t = t_{d} - \\frac{T_{w}}{2}$, $u = -\\frac{T_{w}}{2}$. When $t = t_{d} + \\frac{T_{w}}{2}$, $u = \\frac{T_{w}}{2}$. The integral becomes:\n$$B_{d}(H) = \\alpha H \\int_{-\\frac{T_{w}}{2}}^{\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} |u|\\,\\mathrm{d}u$$\nThe integrand $|u|$ is an even function, so we can write the integral as:\n$$B_{d}(H) = \\alpha H \\left( 2 \\int_{0}^{\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} u\\,\\mathrm{d}u \\right)$$\n$$B_{d}(H) = \\alpha H \\left( 2 \\left[ \\frac{u^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} \\right) = \\alpha H \\left( \\left(\\frac{T_{w}}{2}\\right)^{2} - 0^2 \\right)$$\nThis yields the expression for diastolic motion blur:\n$$B_{d}(H) = \\alpha H \\frac{T_{w}^{2}}{4}$$\n\nSimilarly, for a window centered at mid-systole ($t_{0} = t_{s}$), the velocity is $v_s(t;H) = a_s |t - t_s|$, where $a_s = \\beta$. The motion blur, $B_{s}(H)$, is:\n$$B_{s}(H) = \\int_{t_{s}-\\frac{T_{w}}{2}}^{t_{s}+\\frac{T_{w}}{2}} \\beta |t - t_{s}|\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThe structure of this integral is identical to the diastolic case. Replacing $\\alpha H$ with $\\beta$, we obtain the expression for systolic motion blur:\n$$B_{s}(H) = \\beta \\frac{T_{w}^{2}}{4}$$\nNote that while denoted $B_s(H)$, this expression is in fact independent of the heart rate $H$.\n\n**Task 2: Analysis of the Diastolic Quiescent Interval**\n\nThe diastolic quiescent interval is defined as the time span during which the coronary artery speed is below a certain small threshold, $v_q > 0$. We use the condition $|v_d(t;H)| \\le v_q$. As $v_d$ is a speed, this is $v_d(t;H) \\le v_q$.\nSubstituting the model for diastolic speed:\n$$\\alpha H |t - t_d| \\le v_q$$\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and $H > 0$, we can divide by $\\alpha H$ without changing the inequality direction:\n$$|t - t_d| \\le \\frac{v_q}{\\alpha H}$$\nThis inequality defines a symmetric time interval around mid-diastole, $t_d$:\n$$t_d - \\frac{v_q}{\\alpha H} \\le t \\le t_d + \\frac{v_q}{\\alpha H}$$\nThe duration of this quiescent interval, $\\Delta t_d$, is the length of this interval:\n$$\\Delta t_d(H) = \\left( t_d + \\frac{v_q}{\\alpha H} \\right) - \\left( t_d - \\frac{v_q}{\\alpha H} \\right) = \\frac{2 v_q}{\\alpha H}$$\nThis expression shows that the duration of the diastolic quiescent interval, $\\Delta t_d(H)$, is inversely proportional to the heart rate $H$. As the heart rate $H$ increases, the denominator $\\alpha H$ increases, causing the duration $\\Delta t_d(H)$ to decrease. This demonstrates that an increased heart rate shortens the effective diastolic quiescent interval.\n\n**Task 3: Derivation of the Threshold Heart Rate**\n\nThe threshold heart rate $H^{\\ast}$ is the heart rate at which the motion blur from mid-diastolic gating is equal to the motion blur from mid-systolic gating. This is defined by the condition $B_{d}(H^{\\ast}) = B_{s}(H^{\\ast})$.\nUsing the expressions derived in Task 1:\n$$\\alpha H^{\\ast} \\frac{T_{w}^{2}}{4} = \\beta \\frac{T_{w}^{2}}{4}$$\nSince $T_{w} = 0.140$ s is non-zero, we can cancel the term $\\frac{T_{w}^{2}}{4}$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$\\alpha H^{\\ast} = \\beta$$\nSolving for $H^{\\ast}$ gives the analytical expression for the threshold heart rate:\n$$H^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}$$\nFor heart rates $H > H^{\\ast}$, since $\\alpha > 0$, we have $\\alpha H > \\alpha H^{\\ast} = \\beta$. Multiplying by the positive constant $\\frac{T_{w}^2}{4}$ gives $\\alpha H \\frac{T_{w}^2}{4} > \\beta \\frac{T_{w}^2}{4}$, which implies $B_{d}(H) > B_{s}(H)$. Thus, for heart rates above $H^{\\ast}$, mid-systolic gating is preferable as it results in less motion blur.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $H^{\\ast}$ using the provided parameters $\\alpha = 0.50$ mm s$^{-2}$ per bpm and $\\beta = 40.0$ mm s$^{-2}$.\n$$H^{\\ast} = \\frac{40.0 \\text{ mm s}^{-2}}{0.50 \\text{ mm s}^{-2} \\text{ bpm}^{-1}} = 80 \\text{ bpm}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. While standard propagation of significant figures would suggest two figures (from $0.50$), we follow the explicit instruction.\n$$H^{\\ast} = 80.0 \\text{ bpm}$$\nThis is the threshold heart rate at which mid-systolic gating becomes the preferred strategy for minimizing motion blur in coronary CT angiography under this model.",

It is therefore deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the root-mean-square (RMS) temporal misregistration, which is defined as the standard deviation of the temporal difference $\\Delta T$. We denote this quantity by $\\sigma_{\\Delta T}$.\n\nThe temporal misregistration between the two segments is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_1 - T_2\n$$\nThe target times $T_1$ and $T_2$ are defined as a fixed fraction $p$ of their respective $R$–$R$ intervals, $RR_1$ and $RR_2$:\n$$\nT_1 = p \\cdot RR_1\n$$\n$$\nT_2 = p \\cdot RR_2\n$$\nSubstituting these definitions into the expression for $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = p \\cdot RR_1 - p \\cdot RR_2 = p(RR_1 - RR_2)\n$$\nThe RMS value $\\sigma_{\\Delta T}$ is the standard deviation of $\\Delta T$, which is the square root of the variance of $\\Delta T$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta T} = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\Delta T)}\n$$\nWe now compute the variance of $\\Delta T$. Using the property that for a constant $c$ and a random variable $X$, $\\text{Var}(cX) = c^2\\text{Var}(X)$, we have:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\Delta T) = \\text{Var}(p(RR_1 - RR_2)) = p^2 \\text{Var}(RR_1 - RR_2)\n$$\nThe problem states that the beat-to-beat $R$–$R$ intervals $RR_i$ are independent. For two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, the variance of their difference is the sum of their variances: $\\text{Var}(X - Y) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y)$. Applying this property to $\\text{Var}(RR_1 - RR_2)$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(RR_1 - RR_2) = \\text{Var}(RR_1) + \\text{Var}(RR_2)\n$$\nThe problem also states that the $R$–$R$ intervals fluctuate with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{RR}$. Since $RR_1$ and $RR_2$ are consecutive heartbeats from the same physiological process, they are considered to be identically distributed. Therefore, they share the same variance, which is the square of the standard deviation:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(RR_1) = \\text{Var}(RR_2) = \\sigma_{RR}^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the variance of the difference:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(RR_1 - RR_2) = \\sigma_{RR}^2 + \\sigma_{RR}^2 = 2\\sigma_{RR}^2\n$$\nNow, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\text{Var}(\\Delta T)$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\Delta T) = p^2 (2\\sigma_{RR}^2) = 2p^2\\sigma_{RR}^2\n$$\nFinally, we take the square root to find the standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\Delta T}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta T} = \\sqrt{2p^2\\sigma_{RR}^2}\n$$\nSince $p$ and $\\sigma_{RR}$ are non-negative quantities, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\Delta T} = p\\sqrt{2}\\sigma_{RR}\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the RMS temporal misregistration.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the numerical values $p = 0.75$ and $\\sigma_{RR} = 15\\,\\text{ms}$.
