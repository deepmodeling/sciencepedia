            "problem": "An Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) system injects a sinusoidal drive current of Root Mean Square (RMS) amplitude $I$ through a pair of electrodes and measures the resulting boundary voltage between another electrode pair. The measured transfer impedance magnitude is $|Z_{t}|$, defined by the relation $|Z_{t}| = |V|/|I|$. The voltmeter front end can be modeled as having an input-referred white voltage noise spectral density $S_{v}$ (RMS per square-root Hertz) and a measurement bandwidth $B$ set by synchronous detection around the drive frequency. To improve precision, $N$ statistically independent averages of the demodulated voltage are performed, which reduces the noise in the averaged estimate.\n\nAssume the following scientifically typical and self-consistent parameters for a thoracic EIT boundary measurement:\n- Drive current amplitude is $I = 1.0~\\mathrm{mA}$ (RMS).\n- Transfer impedance magnitude is $|Z_{t}| = 0.200~\\Omega$.\n- Voltmeter input-referred white noise spectral density is $S_{v} = 100~\\mathrm{nV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ (RMS).\n- Measurement bandwidth is $B = 200~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n- Number of independent averages is $N = 100$.\n\nStarting from first principles—Ohm’s law and the definition of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), the relation between white noise spectral density and integrated RMS noise over bandwidth, and the $\\sqrt{N}$ improvement in RMS noise with averaging—do the following:\n\n1.

It is based on established principles of electrical engineering and signal processing, contains all necessary information, and is free of ambiguity.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested.\n\n### Part 1: Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for a Single Measurement\n\nThis part requires the computation of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in decibels for a single measurement, where the number of averages is $N=1$. The calculation proceeds from first principles.\n\n**1. Signal Amplitude Calculation**\nThe signal is the RMS voltage, $|V|$, generated at the measurement electrodes. According to Ohm's law applied to impedances, this voltage is the product of the RMS drive current magnitude, $|I|$, and the transfer impedance magnitude, $|Z_t|$.\n$$|V| = |I| |Z_t|$$\nUsing the provided values:\n-   Drive current amplitude $|I| = 1.0~\\mathrm{mA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}$.\n-   Transfer impedance magnitude $|Z_t| = 0.200~\\Omega$.\n\nThe signal RMS voltage is:\n$$|V| = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}) \\times (0.200~\\Omega) = 0.200 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{V} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. Noise Amplitude Calculation**\nThe noise is modeled as input-referred white voltage noise with a spectral density $S_v$. The total RMS noise voltage, $V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}}$, in a measurement bandwidth $B$ is given by the relation:\n$$V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} = S_v \\sqrt{B}$$\nUsing the provided values:\n-   Noise spectral density $S_v = 100~\\mathrm{nV}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$.\n-   Measurement bandwidth $B = 200~\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nThe RMS noise voltage for a single measurement ($N=1$) is:\n$$V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}) \\times \\sqrt{200~\\mathrm{Hz}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 10\\sqrt{2}~\\mathrm{V} = \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}$$\nNumerically, this is approximately $V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}} \\approx 1.4142 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**3. SNR Calculation**\nThe Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) is defined as the ratio of signal power to noise power. For voltage signals measured across the same impedance, this is equivalent to the square of the ratio of their RMS amplitudes. However, a common convention in signal processing, which we adopt here, is to express SNR as the ratio of the RMS signal amplitude to the RMS noise amplitude.\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} = \\frac{|V|}{V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the signal and noise amplitudes:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{V}}{\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{2.00 \\times 10^2}{\\sqrt{2}} = 100\\sqrt{2}$$\nNumerically, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}} \\approx 141.42$.\n\n**4. Conversion to Decibels (dB)**\nThe SNR is requested in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$). The conversion from an amplitude ratio to decibels is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{amp}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(100\\sqrt{2}) = 20 \\left( \\log_{10}(10^2) + \\log_{10}(2^{1/2}) \\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\left( 2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\log_{10}(2) \\right) = 40 + 10\\log_{10}(2)$$\nUsing the approximation $\\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103$:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} \\approx 40 + 10 \\times 0.30103 = 40 + 3.0103 = 43.0103~\\mathrm{dB}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the SNR for a single measurement is $43.01~\\mathrm{dB}$.\n\n### Part 2: Minimum Detectable Transfer Impedance Change\n\nThis part requires the derivation of an expression for the minimum detectable transfer impedance change, $|\\Delta Z_{\\min}|$, and its numerical evaluation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Expression**\nThe signal of interest for this detection problem is the change in voltage, $|\\Delta V|$, caused by a small change in the transfer impedance, $|\\Delta Z|$. From Ohm's law, assuming the drive current $|I|$ is constant, this relationship is:\n$$|\\Delta V| = |I| |\\Delta Z|$$\nThe noise that limits the detection of this signal is the averaged RMS noise voltage, $V_{n, \\mathrm{avg}}$. Taking $N$ statistically independent averages of the voltage reduces the RMS noise by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$:\n$$V_{n, \\mathrm{avg}} = \\frac{V_{n, \\mathrm{rms}}}{\\sqrt{N}} = \\frac{S_v \\sqrt{B}}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\nThe minimum detectable change is defined as the condition where the signal magnitude equals the averaged noise magnitude, i.e., when the signal-to-noise ratio for the change is unity.\n$$|\\Delta V|_{\\min} = V_{n, \\mathrm{avg}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the voltage change and the averaged noise:\n$$|I| |\\Delta Z|_{\\min} = \\frac{S_v \\sqrt{B}}{\\sqrt{N}}$$\nSolving for the minimum detectable transfer impedance change, $|\\Delta Z|_{\\min}$, yields the closed-form expression:\n$$|\\Delta Z|_{\\min} = \\frac{S_v \\sqrt{B}}{|I| \\sqrt{N}}$$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the following parameters:\n-   $S_v = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$\n-   $B = 200~\\mathrm{Hz}$\n-   $|I| = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $N = 100$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$|\\Delta Z|_{\\min} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-7}~\\mathrm{V}/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}) \\sqrt{200~\\mathrm{Hz}}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A}) \\sqrt{100}}$$\n$$|\\Delta Z|_{\\min} = \\frac{(1.00 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 10\\sqrt{2}}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 10}~\\Omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-6}}{10^{-2}}~\\Omega = \\sqrt{2} \\times 10^{-4}~\\Omega$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$|\\Delta Z|_{\\min} \\approx 1.41421356 \\times 10^{-4}~\\Omega$$\nThe question asks for the result in micro-ohms ($\\mu\\Omega$). The conversion is $1~\\Omega = 10^6~\\mu\\Omega$.\n$$|\\Delta Z|_{\\min} \\approx (1.41421356 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 10^6~\\mu\\Omega = 141.421356~\\mu\\Omega$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimum detectable transfer impedance change is $141.4~\\mu\\Omega$.",

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires deriving the phase shift $\\phi(\\omega)$ of the total measured transfer impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)$. The total impedance is composed of three elements connected in series: the first electrode-skin interface, the bulk tissue, and the second electrode-skin interface.\n\nFirst, we define the impedance of a single electrode-skin interface, $z_{\\ell}(\\omega)$. The problem states this is a series combination of a contact resistance $r_{\\ell}$ and a capacitance $c_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe impedance of a resistor is its resistance, which is a real number. So, the impedance of the contact resistance is $r_{\\ell}$.\n\nThe impedance of a capacitor with capacitance $c_{\\ell}$ at an angular frequency $\\omega$ is a complex quantity given by:\n$$\nZ_{c} = \\frac{1}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\nwhere $j$ is the imaginary unit, defined as $j = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\nSince the resistance $r_{\\ell}$ and capacitance $c_{\\ell}$ are in series for a single electrode interface, their impedances add up. The impedance of one electrode, $z_{\\ell}(\\omega)$, is:\n$$\nz_{\\ell}(\\omega) = r_{\\ell} + \\frac{1}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nThe total circuit consists of the first electrode, the tissue bulk, and the second electrode, all in series. Therefore, the total transfer impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)$ is the sum of their individual impedances:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega) = z_{\\ell}(\\omega) + R_{t} + z_{\\ell}(\\omega)\n$$\nwhere $R_{t}$ is the impedance of the purely resistive tissue bulk.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $z_{\\ell}(\\omega)$, we get:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega) = 2 z_{\\ell}(\\omega) + R_{t} = 2 \\left( r_{\\ell} + \\frac{1}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}} \\right) + R_{t}\n$$\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega) = 2r_{\\ell} + \\frac{2}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}} + R_{t}\n$$\n\nTo find the phase shift, we must first express the complex impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)$ in its rectangular form, $Z = \\mathrm{Re}(Z) + j \\mathrm{Im}(Z)$. We use the identity $\\frac{1}{j} = -j$:\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega) = (R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}) + \\frac{2}{j \\omega c_{\\ell}} = (R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}) - j \\frac{2}{\\omega c_{\\ell}}\n$$\n\nFrom this form, we can identify the real and imaginary parts of the total transfer impedance:\nThe real part is $\\mathrm{Re}(Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)) = R_{t} + 2r_{\\ell}$.\nThe imaginary part is $\\mathrm{Im}(Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)) = -\\frac{2}{\\omega c_{\\ell}}$.\n\nThe phase shift $\\phi(\\omega)$ is the argument of the complex impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\omega)$. For a complex number $Z = x+jy$, the argument is given by $\\phi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{y}{x}\\right)$.

It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in two-dimensional potential theory, which is a foundational model in electrical impedance tomography. The provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient to derive a unique solution for the current density.\n\nThe problem asks for the current density distribution $j(x)$ on a single electrode placed on the boundary of a homogeneous, isotropic conducting half-plane. The governing physics is described by the conductivity equation in a quasi-static regime.\n\nThe domain is the upper half-plane $\\Omega = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : y > 0\\}$. The conductivity $\\gamma$ is a positive constant. The governing equation for the electric potential $u(x,y)$ is $\\nabla \\cdot (\\gamma \\nabla u) = 0$.

The remainder of the boundary, $\\{(x,0) : |x| > a\\}$, is electrically insulating. This means the normal component of the current density is zero.

The condition is $\\gamma \\partial_{\\mathbf{n}} u = \\gamma (\\nabla u \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) = -\\gamma \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = 0$. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0) = 0$ for $|x| > a$.\n3.  Physically, we expect the potential disturbance to vanish far from the source, so we assume $u(x,y)$ is bounded as $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\to \\infty$.\n\nThis is a classic mixed boundary value problem for Laplace's equation. We can solve it efficiently using methods from complex analysis. Let $z = x+iy$ be a complex variable and let $F(z) = u(x,y) + iv(x,y)$ be the complex potential, which is an analytic function in the upper half-plane. The functions $u$ and $v$ are related by the Cauchy-Riemann equations: $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y}$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}$.\n\nThe derivative of the complex potential is $F'(z) = \\frac{dF}{dz} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. We can translate the boundary conditions on $u$ into conditions on the real and imaginary parts of $F'(z)$ on the real axis ($z=x$):\n- For $|x| < a$, $u(x,0)=V_0$ is constant, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x,0) = 0$. This implies $F'(x) = -i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0)$, which means $F'(x)$ is purely imaginary.\n- For $|x| > a$, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0)=0$. This implies $F'(x) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x,0)$, which means $F'(x)$ is purely real.\n\nWe need to find an analytic function $F'(z)$ that is real on the real axis for $|x|>a$ and purely imaginary for $|x|<a$. A function of the form $F'(z) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{z^2 - a^2}}$ for some constant $A$ has this property. We choose the branch cut for the square root to lie on the segment $[-a, a]$ of the real axis, so that $F'(z)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane. For $z$ in the upper half-plane approaching a point $x$ on the real axis:\n- If $|x| > a$, $x^2-a^2 > 0$, so $\\sqrt{x^2-a^2}$ is real. $F'(x)$ is real.\n- If $|x| < a$, $x^2-a^2 < 0$. Approaching from the upper half-plane, $\\arg(z-a) \\approx \\pi$ and $\\arg(z+a) \\approx 0$, so $\\arg(z^2-a^2) \\approx \\pi$. Thus, $\\sqrt{z^2-a^2}$ on the cut is of the form $i\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}$. So $F'(x) = \\frac{A}{i\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} = -i\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$. This is purely imaginary.\n\nThe proposed form for $F'(z)$ is therefore correct. Now we relate this to the current density. The current density on the electrode is defined as $j(x) = \\gamma \\partial_{\\mathbf{n}} u(x,0) = -\\gamma \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0)$ for $|x| \\leq a$.\nFrom the expression for the complex derivative, $F'(z) = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} - i\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$, we can identify $-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ as the imaginary part of $F'(z)$.\nOn the electrode, for $|x| < a$, we have $F'(x) = -i\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$.\nThe imaginary part is $\\text{Im}(F'(x)) = -\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$.\nThus, for $|x|<a$, we have $-\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0) = \\text{Im}(F'(x)) = -\\frac{A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$.\nThe current density is then $j(x) = \\gamma \\left( -\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}(x,0) \\right) = -\\frac{\\gamma A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$.\n\nTo determine the constant $A$, we use the condition that the total injected current is $I$:\n$$I = \\int_{-a}^{a} j(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-a}^{a} -\\frac{\\gamma A}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} \\, dx$$\nThis is a standard integral:\n$$I = -\\gamma A \\left[ \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right) \\right]_{-a}^{a} = -\\gamma A (\\arcsin(1) - \\arcsin(-1)) = -\\gamma A \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) = -\\gamma A \\pi$$\nSolving for $A$, we find $A = -\\frac{I}{\\gamma \\pi}$.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the formula for $j(x)$:\n$$j(x) = -\\frac{\\gamma}{\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}} \\left(-\\frac{I}{\\gamma \\pi}\\right) = \\frac{I}{\\pi\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the current density on the electrode for $|x|<a$.\n\nThis result demonstrates that the current density $j(x)$ is highly non-uniform. It is symmetric about $x=0$, has its minimum value at the center of the electrode, $j(0) = \\frac{I}{\\pi a}$, and increases towards the edges, becoming singular as $x \\to \\pm a$. This phenomenon is known as the \"edge effect\" or \"current crowding,\" and it is a fundamental consequence of the physics of potential fields at geometric discontinuities in boundary conditions (here, the sharp transition from a perfect conductor to a perfect insulator). The singularities are an artifact of the idealized model; in any real physical system, the current density would be very large but finite at the edges.\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the simplistic lumped model, which assumes a uniform current density $j_{\\text{lumped}} = \\frac{I}{2a}$. This model ignores the underlying field distribution dictated by Laplace's equation. The analytical solution shows the lumped model is incorrect, underestimating the current density at the edges (where it is infinite in the model) and overestimating it at the center, since $j(0) = \\frac{I}{\\pi a} \\approx 0.637 \\frac{I}{2a} < j_{\\text{lumped}}$.
