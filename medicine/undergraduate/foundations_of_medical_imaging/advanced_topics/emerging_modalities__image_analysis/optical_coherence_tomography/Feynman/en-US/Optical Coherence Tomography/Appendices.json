            "introduction": "In Optical Coherence Tomography, we can build a three-dimensional image by measuring the time it takes for light to reflect from different depths within a sample. This first practice explores the fundamental principle of time-domain OCT, where a moving reference mirror scans for these reflections. By timing the appearance of interference peaks, we can directly calculate the optical thickness of a structure, a crucial first step in characterizing a sample. ",

            "problem": "An engineer is using a time-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) system to perform a non-invasive quality control measurement on a batch of flat, parallel glass slides. The OCT system is based on a Michelson interferometer. In this setup, light from a low-coherence source is split into two paths: a reference arm and a sample arm. The light in the reference arm reflects from a mirror, while the light in the sample arm reflects from the glass slide. The reflected light from both arms is then recombined at a detector.\n\nTo perform a depth scan (known as an A-scan), the reference mirror is moved along the optical axis at a constant velocity, $v_m$. An interferometric signal is generated at the detector only when the optical path length of the reference arm is nearly identical to the optical path length of the sample arm. During a scan of one particular slide, the system's detector registers two distinct, sharp interference peaks. The first peak, corresponding to the reflection from the top surface of the slide, is detected at time $t_1 = 1.25$ ms. The second peak, corresponding to the reflection from the bottom surface, is detected at time $t_2 = 4.28$ ms. The reference mirror moves at a constant velocity of $v_m = 0.500$ m/s throughout the scan. The time measurement starts at $t=0$ when the mirror starts moving from its initial position.\n\nCalculate the optical thickness of the glass slide. The optical thickness is defined as the product of the refractive index of the material and its physical thickness. Express your answer in millimeters (mm), rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "In a Michelson interferometer, translating the reference mirror by a distance changes the reference arm optical path length by twice that distance. With the mirror moving at constant velocity $v_{m}$, the reference arm optical path length is\n$$\n\\text{OPL}_{\\text{ref}}(t) = L_{r0} + 2 v_{m} t,\n$$\nwhere $L_{r0}$ is the initial reference arm optical path length at $t=0$.\n\nInterference occurs when the reference and sample arm optical path lengths are equal. Let the sample arm optical path length for the top-surface reflection be $L_{s0}$. The bottom-surface reflection adds a round-trip optical path inside the glass equal to $2 n d$, where $n$ is the refractive index and $d$ is the physical thickness.

            "introduction": "While measuring the distance between two surfaces is useful, an OCT system's true power lies in its ability to distinguish between very closely spaced layers. This ability is called axial resolution, and it is fundamentally determined by the properties of the light source.
