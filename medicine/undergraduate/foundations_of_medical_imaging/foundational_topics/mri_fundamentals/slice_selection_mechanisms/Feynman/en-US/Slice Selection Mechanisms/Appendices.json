This is achieved by applying a magnetic field gradient, $G_z$, which ensures that only a specific slice of tissue is resonant with the applied radiofrequency (RF) pulse. This hands-on problem, , allows you to calculate the most crucial parameter in this process: the slice thickness, $\\Delta z$. By working through the direct relationship between the RF pulse bandwidth, $\\Delta f$, and the gradient strength, you will solidify your understanding of how scanner parameters directly control the geometry of the acquired image.",
