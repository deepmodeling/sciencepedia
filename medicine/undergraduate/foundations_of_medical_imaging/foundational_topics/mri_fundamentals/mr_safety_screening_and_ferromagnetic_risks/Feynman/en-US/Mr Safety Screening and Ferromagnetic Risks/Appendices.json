The context of a ferromagnetic object experiencing a strong force in an MRI scanner's fringe field is a well-established and critical safety issue in medical physics.

It is a straightforward and physically meaningful application of classical mechanics in the context of MRI safety. A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n### Part 1: Calculation of Instantaneous Acceleration (Negligible Friction)\n\nThe motion of the tool is governed by Newton's Second Law of Motion, which states that the net force acting on an object is equal to the product of its mass and acceleration:\n$$\n\\sum \\vec{F} = m\\vec{a}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the motion occurs along the bore axis, which we can define as the $x$-axis. Let the direction toward the isocenter be the positive $x$-direction. The only force acting on the tool in this direction is the magnetic force, $\\vec{F}_{mag}$, as frictional effects are considered negligible. Therefore, the net force is:\n$$\n\\sum \\vec{F} = \\vec{F}_{mag}\n$$\nIn scalar form, along the $x$-axis, the equation becomes:\n$$\nF_{mag} = ma\n$$\nWe are asked to find the instantaneous acceleration, $a$. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$\na = \\frac{F_{mag}}{m}\n$$\nThe problem provides the values for the magnetic force, $F_{mag} = 30.0\\,\\text{N}$, and the mass of the tool, $m = 1.000\\,\\text{kg}$. Substituting these values into the equation yields:\n$$\na = \\frac{30.0\\,\\text{N}}{1.000\\,\\text{kg}}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{N} = 1\\,\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$, the units are consistent:\n$$\na = 30.0\\,\\frac{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}}{\\text{kg}} = 30.0\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}\n$$\nThe given value for force, $30.0\\,\\text{N}$, has three significant figures. The mass, $1.000\\,\\text{kg}$, has four. The result of the division should be reported to the lesser number of significant figures, which is three. The calculated value is already $30.0$, which has three significant figures.\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of Frictional Effects (Symbolic)\n\nThis part requires a first-principles explanation of how friction can prevent motion. We begin by considering the forces acting on the tool when it is at rest on the horizontal patient table.\n\nLet $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity. The forces acting in the vertical direction are the gravitational force, $F_g = mg$, acting downward, and the normal force, $N$, exerted by the table on the tool, acting upward. For the tool to be in equilibrium in the vertical direction (i.e., not accelerating up or down), these forces must balance:\n$$\n\\sum F_{y} = N - mg = 0 \\implies N = mg\n$$\nIn the horizontal direction (along the bore axis), the magnetic force, $F_{mag}$, pulls the tool toward the isocenter. To counteract this force and keep the tool at rest, the force of static friction, $f_s$, must act in the opposite direction. For equilibrium in the horizontal direction:\n$$\n\\sum F_{x} = F_{mag} - f_s = 0 \\implies f_s = F_{mag}\n$$\nThe Coulomb model of static friction states that the static friction force can adjust its magnitude to be equal and opposite to the applied force, up to a maximum possible value, $f_{s,max}$. This maximum value is proportional to the normal force, $N$:\n$$\nf_{s,max} = \\mu_s N\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction between the tool and the table surface. For the tool to remain at rest, the required static friction force ($f_s = F_{mag}$) cannot exceed this maximum possible value. This condition gives the inequality that must be satisfied for the tool to remain stationary:\n$$\nf_s \\le f_{s,max}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_s$ and $f_{s,max}$ (with $N=mg$), we obtain the precise inequality:\n$$\nF_{mag} \\le \\mu_s mg\n$$\nIf this inequality holds, the tool remains at rest. If the magnetic force exceeds this threshold ($F_{mag} > \\mu_s mg$), the static friction is overcome, and the tool begins to slip and accelerate.\n\nOnce slip begins, the friction force is no longer static but kinetic. The kinetic friction force, $f_k$, opposes the motion and, according to the Coulomb model, has a magnitude given by:\n$$\nf_k = \\mu_k N = \\mu_k mg\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction. The net force on the tool along the bore axis is now the difference between the magnetic force and the kinetic friction force:\n$$\n\\sum F_x = F_{mag} - f_k\n$$\nApplying Newton's Second Law, $ \\sum F_x = ma $:\n$$\nF_{mag} - \\mu_k mg = ma\n$$\nSolving for the acceleration, $a$, of the tool once it starts slipping gives its symbolic form:\n$$\na = \\frac{F_{mag} - \\mu_k mg}{m}\n$$\nThis expression describes the instantaneous acceleration of the tool as it slides towards the isocenter under the influence of both the magnetic force and kinetic friction.",

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation of Kinetic Energy**\n\nThe work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy, $K$.\n$$W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K = K_{f} - K_{i}$$\nSince the object starts from rest, its initial kinetic energy is $K_{i} = 0$. The net work is done by the magnetic force, as other forces are neglected. Thus, the final kinetic energy $K$ is equal to the work done by the magnetic force, $W_{\\text{mag}}$, as the object moves from $x_{i}$ to $x_{f}$.\n$$K = K_{f} = W_{\\text{mag}}$$\nThe work can be found by integrating the force over the path or from the change in potential energy. Using the potential energy approach is more direct. The potential energy $U$ of a magnetic dipole moment $\\vec{m}$ in an external magnetic field $\\vec{B}$ is given by:\n$$U = -\\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{B}$$\nThe problem states that the object's magnetic moment $\\vec{m}$ saturates and aligns with the local field $\\vec{B}$. Since the field is directed along the $x$-axis, $\\vec{B} = B(x)\\hat{x}$, the dipole moment is also $\\vec{m} = m\\hat{x}$, where $m$ is its magnitude. The dot product simplifies to:\n$$U(x) = -m B(x)$$\nThe work done by the conservative magnetic force is equal to the negative change in potential energy:\n$$W_{\\text{mag}} = -\\Delta U = -(U(x_{f}) - U(x_{i}))$$\nSubstituting the expression for $U(x)$:\n$$W_{\\text{mag}} = -(-m B(x_{f}) - (-m B(x_{i}))) = m(B(x_{f}) - B(x_{i}))$$\nTherefore, the final kinetic energy is:\n$$K = m(B(x_{f}) - B(x_{i}))$$\nAs a check, we can derive this from the force. The force on the dipole is $F_x = -\\frac{dU}{dx}$:\n$$F_x(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx}(-m B(x)) = m \\frac{dB(x)}{dx}$$\nThe work done is the integral of this force:\n$$W_{\\text{mag}} = \\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} F_x(x) dx = \\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} m \\frac{dB}{dx} dx = m \\int_{B(x_{i})}^{B(x_{f})} dB = m [B(x)]_{x_{i}}^{x_{f}} = m(B(x_{f}) - B(x_{i}))$$\nThis confirms the result obtained from the potential energy difference.\n\nNow we determine the terms in the expression for $K$.\nThe magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment, $m$, is given by $m = M_s V$. The volume $V$ of the object is its mass $m_{\\mathrm{obj}}$ divided by its density $\\rho$:\n$$V = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}$$\nSo, the magnetic moment is:\n$$m = M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}$$\nNext, we evaluate the magnetic field at the initial and final positions using the given profile $B(x) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L}\\right)\\right)$.\nAt the initial position $x_{i} = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$B(x_{i}) = B(0) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{L}\\right)\\right) = B_{0}(1 - \\exp(0)) = B_{0}(1-1) = 0\\,\\mathrm{T}$$\nAt the final position $x_{f} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$B(x_{f}) = B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right)$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for kinetic energy:\n$$K = \\left(M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho}\\right) \\left( B_{0}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right) - 0 \\right)$$\n$$K = M_{s} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}{\\rho} B_{0} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{f}}{L}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$m_{\\mathrm{obj}} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n$\\rho = 7.8 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}$\n$M_{s} = 1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}$\n$B_{0} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$\n$L = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$x_{f} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the magnetic moment $m$:\n$$m = (1.6 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{A/m}) \\frac{0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{7.8 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^{3}}} \\approx 1.02564 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}$$\nNext, the ratio in the exponential:\n$$\\frac{x_{f}}{L} = \\frac{2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 4.0$$\nNow, we calculate the final kinetic energy $K$:\n$$K = (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{A \\cdot m^2}) \\times (1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-4.0))$$\n$$K \\approx (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}) \\times (1.5) \\times (1 - 0.0183156)\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$K \\approx (1.02564 \\times 10^{2}) \\times (1.5) \\times (0.9816844)\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$K \\approx 151.031\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$K \\approx 151\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\nA kinetic energy of $151\\,\\mathrm{J}$ for a $0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ object (approximately $1.1\\,\\mathrm{lbs}$) constitutes a lethal projectile risk. To contextualize this energy, we can calculate the object's final velocity, $v_f$:\n$$K = \\frac{1}{2} m_{\\mathrm{obj}} v_f^2 \\implies v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2K}{m_{\\mathrm{obj}}}}$$\n$$v_f = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 151\\,\\mathrm{J}}{0.50\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} = \\sqrt{604}\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 24.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThis velocity corresponds to approximately $88.5\\,\\mathrm{km/h}$ or $55\\,\\mathrm{mph}$. An object of this mass traveling at this speed can cause catastrophic impact damage, equivalent to or exceeding the impact energy of many hand tools swung with maximal force. If such a projectile were to strike a person (e.g., a patient inside the MRI bore or a healthcare worker), it would almost certainly result in severe trauma or death. This calculation, although based on a simplified model, quantitatively demonstrates the immense danger posed by the magnetic forces in an MRI environment on seemingly small ferromagnetic objects. It underscores the absolute necessity for rigorous and comprehensive MR safety screening procedures to prevent any such objects from entering the high-field area. The \"missile effect\" is one of the most severe and well-documented physical hazards associated with MRI technology.",

For a small particle where magnetization $\\mathbf{M}$ is uniform and aligned with the external field, and the field has a gradient only along the $z$-axis, this simplifies to a force along the $z$-axis:\n$$ F_z = m_z \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_z}{\\mathrm{d}z} $$\nwhere $m_z$ is the $z$-component of the total magnetic moment of the particle.

Quantitative Comparison (Ratio)**\nFinally, we compute the ratio $F_{\\text{sphere}}/F_{\\text{needle}}$. Using the derived expressions for the forces:\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{sphere}}}{F_{\\text{needle}}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{sphere}} V \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}z}}{M_{\\text{needle}} V \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B}{\\mathrm{d}z}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{sphere}}}{M_{\\text{needle}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for magnetization:\n$$ \\frac{M_{\\text{sphere}}}{M_{\\text{needle}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{1 + \\chi N_{\\text{sphere}}}\\right) H_{\\text{ext}}}{\\left(\\frac{\\chi}{1 + \\chi N_{\\text{needle}}}\\right) H_{\\text{ext}}} = \\frac{1 + \\chi N_{\\text{needle}}}{1 + \\chi N_{\\text{sphere}}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this exact symbolic ratio: $\\chi = 100$, $N_{\\text{sphere}} = 1/3$, and $N_{\\text{needle}} = 0$.\n$$ \\frac{F_{\\text{sphere}}}{F_{\\text{needle}}} = \\frac{1 + (100)(0)}{1 + (100)(\\frac{1}{3})} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{100}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3+100}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{103}{3}} = \\frac{3}{103} $$\nThe numerical value of the ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{3}{103} \\approx 0.0291262... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is $0.0291$. This shows that the demagnetizing field in the sphere significantly reduces its magnetization and the resulting translational force compared to an elongated object of the same volume.",
