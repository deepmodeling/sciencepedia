It is a standard, well-posed problem in applied physics that is scientifically grounded and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe superconducting magnet in persistent mode is modeled as a simple RL circuit with no external voltage source. Applying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), the sum of voltage drops across the components in the closed loop must be zero. The voltage drop across the inductor is $V_L = L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt}$ and the voltage drop across the residual resistance is $V_R = I(t)R_j$.\n\nTherefore, the KVL equation is:\n$$L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t)R_{j} = 0$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$L \\frac{dI}{dt} = -I R_j$$\n$$\\frac{1}{I} dI = -\\frac{R_j}{L} dt$$\nWe integrate both sides. Let the initial current at time $t=0$ be $I_0$. We integrate the current from $I_0$ to $I(t)$ and time from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\\int_{I_0}^{I(t)} \\frac{1}{I'} dI' = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\frac{R_j}{L} dt'$$\n$$[\\ln|I'|]_{I_0}^{I(t)} = -\\frac{R_j}{L} [t']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$\\ln(I(t)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\frac{R_j}{L} t$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(t)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\frac{R_j}{L} t$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the time dependence of the current:\n$$I(t) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_j}{L}t\\right)$$\nThe problem states that the magnetic field $B$ is proportional to the current $I$. Let this proportionality be represented by a constant $k$, such that $B(t) = k I(t)$.\nAt $t=0$, the initial field is $B_0$ and the initial current is $I_0$, so $B_0 = k I_0$. From this, we have $k = B_0/I_0$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B(t)$:\n$$B(t) = \\left(\\frac{B_0}{I_0}\\right) I(t) = \\left(\\frac{B_0}{I_0}\\right) \\left(I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_j}{L}t\\right)\\right)$$\n$$B(t) = B_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_j}{L}t\\right)$$\nThis is the time dependence of the magnetic field. Both the current and magnetic field exhibit exponential decay.\n\nThe standard form for exponential decay is $A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\tau$ is the time constant. By comparing our derived expression for $B(t)$ with the standard form, we identify the time constant $\\tau$ for this RL circuit as:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{L}{R_j}$$\nUsing the given values $L = 500$ $\\mathrm{H}$ and $R_j = 10^{-12}$ $\\Omega$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{500}{10^{-12}} = 5 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time constant is $\\tau = 5.00 \\times 10^{14}$ $\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the percentage field drift over a period of $t = 24$ hours. First, we convert this time to seconds:\n$$t = 24 \\, \\mathrm{h} \\times 60 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{min}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\times 60 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{min}} = 86400 \\, \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe field drift is the change in the magnetic field, $\\Delta B = B_0 - B(t)$. The fractional drift is $\\frac{\\Delta B}{B_0}$. The percentage field drift, which we denote as $D_{\\%}$, is this fraction multiplied by $100$:\n$$D_{\\%} = \\frac{B_0 - B(t)}{B_0} \\times 100 = \\left(1 - \\frac{B(t)}{B_0}\\right) \\times 100$$\nSubstituting the expression for $B(t)$:\n$$D_{\\%} = \\left(1 - \\frac{B_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau)}{B_0}\\right) \\times 100 = \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) \\times 100$$\nNow we compute the value of the exponent's argument:\n$$\\frac{t}{\\tau} = \\frac{86400 \\, \\mathrm{s}}{5.00 \\times 10^{14} \\, \\mathrm{s}} = 1.728 \\times 10^{-10}$$\nSince this value is much less than $1$ ($t/\\tau \\ll 1$), we can use the first-order Taylor series approximation for the exponential function, $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$. This approximation is highly accurate in this case.\n$$D_{\\%} \\approx \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{t}{\\tau} \\times 100$$\n$$D_{\\%} \\approx (1.728 \\times 10^{-10}) \\times 100 = 1.728 \\times 10^{-8}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{\\%} \\approx 1.73 \\times 10^{-8}$$\nThis value represents the requested \"decimal number of percent,\" meaning if the drift were $0.25\\%$, the answer would be $0.25$. Our answer is $1.73 \\times 10^{-8}$.\n\nThe two quantities to be reported are the time constant $\\tau = 5.00 \\times 10^{14}$ s and the percentage field drift $1.73 \\times 10^{-8}$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and circuit theory, specifically as they apply to the critical engineering concern of quench protection in superconducting magnets. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique and meaningful solution. The provided physical values are realistic for a high-field medical imaging magnet.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts: calculation of the stored energy, determination of the minimum dump resistance and peak voltage, calculation of the decay time constant, and a justification of the relevance of these parameters to MRI magnet design.\n\n**1. Stored Electromagnetic Energy**\n\nThe total electromagnetic energy $E$ stored in an inductor with inductance $L$ carrying a current $I$ is given by the fundamental relation:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} L I^2$$\nThe problem provides the steady-state operating current $I_{0} = 250\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and the magnet inductance $L = 500\\,\\mathrm{H}$.

Circuit Analysis and Minimum Dump Resistance**\n\nWhen a quench occurs, the power supply is isolated, and the magnet current is shunted through a dump resistor $R_{dump}$. The magnet and resistor form a simple series RL circuit. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law to this loop, we have:\n$$V_L(t) + V_R(t) = 0$$\nwhere $V_L(t)$ is the voltage across the inductor and $V_R(t)$ is the voltage across the resistor. These are given by $V_L(t) = L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt}$ and $V_R(t) = I(t)R_{dump}$. The resulting differential equation is:\n$$L \\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + I(t)R_{dump} = 0$$\nThe solution to this first-order homogeneous differential equation, with the initial condition $I(t=0) = I_0$, is an exponential decay:\n$$I(t) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R_{dump}}{L}t\\right) = I_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{dump}}$ is the exponential time constant of the current decay.\n\nThe voltage across the magnet terminals during this discharge is $V_L(t)$. From the circuit equation, $V_L(t) = -V_R(t) = -I(t)R_{dump}$. Substituting the expression for $I(t)$:\n$$V_L(t) = -(I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau))R_{dump} = -I_0 R_{dump} \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nThe magnitude of this voltage is $|V_L(t)| = I_0 R_{dump} \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. The peak voltage magnitude occurs at the instant the discharge begins, $t=0$, because the exponential term is maximal at this time ($\\exp(0)=1$).\n$$|V_L|_{peak} = I_0 R_{dump}$$\nThe problem states that this peak voltage must not exceed the insulation rating $V_{max} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{kV}$.\n$$|V_L|_{peak} \\le V_{max}$$\n$$I_0 R_{dump} \\le V_{max}$$\nTo find the minimum required dump resistance, $R_{dump, min}$, we must select the resistance that produces the maximum allowable voltage. A resistor smaller than this would produce a lower voltage, but the problem seeks the minimum resistance that still satisfies the constraint, which implies we should operate at the boundary. Therefore, we set the peak voltage equal to $V_{max}$:\n$$I_0 R_{dump, min} = V_{max}$$\nSolving for $R_{dump, min}$:\n$$R_{dump, min} = \\frac{V_{max}}{I_0}$$\nUsing the given values $V_{max} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{kV} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $I_0 = 250\\,\\mathrm{A}$:\n$$R_{dump, min} = \\frac{1500\\,\\mathrm{V}}{250\\,\\mathrm{A}} = 6.00\\,\\Omega$$\nThe corresponding peak voltage magnitude is, by this definition, exactly the maximum allowable voltage, $V_{max} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{kV}$.\n\n**3. Exponential Time Constant**\n\nThe time constant $\\tau$ for the current decay is calculated using the minimum resistance $R_{dump, min}$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{L}{R_{dump, min}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{H}}{6.00\\,\\Omega} = 83.333...\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the time constant is $\\tau \\approx 83.3\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**4. Justification and Relation to Field Strength**\n\nThe parameters in this problem are directly linked to the fundamental requirements and operational safety of an MRI magnet.\nThe primary goal of an MRI magnet is to generate a strong, homogeneous magnetic field $B_0$ over the imaging volume. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MRI is approximately proportional to $B_0$, so higher fields (e.g., $1.5\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $3\\,\\mathrm{T}$, $7\\,\\mathrm{T}$) are highly desirable. The energy stored in the magnetic field is proportional to the square of the field strength and the volume it occupies ($E \\propto B_0^2 \\times Volume$). This means that high-field, whole-body MRI magnets store an immense amount of energy, on the order of megajoules, as calculated in part 1. This energy is a direct consequence of the required high field strength.\n\nA \"quench\" is an uncontrolled loss of superconductivity in the magnet coil, where a section of the coil transitions to its normal, resistive state. This resistive zone generates intense Joule heat ($P=I^2R_{\\text{zone}}$), which can boil off the liquid helium cryogen and, more critically, cause permanent thermal damage or melting of the magnet windings if the energy is not dissipated quickly and safely.\n\nThe quench protection system, involving the dump resistor $R_{dump}$, is designed to rapidly extract the magnet's stored energy and dissipate it as heat externally, away from the delicate magnet coils. The rate of energy extraction is governed by the time constant $\\tau = L/R_{dump}$. A rapid discharge (small $\\tau$) requires a large $R_{dump}$.\n\nHowever, a large $R_{dump}$ creates a high peak voltage across the magnet terminals ($|V_L|_{peak} = I_0 R_{dump}$). If this voltage exceeds the dielectric strength of the magnet's insulation, $V_{max}$, it can cause an electrical arc between windings, short-circuiting and catastrophically destroying the magnet.\n\nTherefore, the design of the quench protection system involves a critical trade-off. The dump resistance $R_{dump}$ must be small enough to keep the terminal voltage below the insulation rating $V_{max}$, yet large enough to ensure the time constant $\\tau$ is short enough to prevent thermal damage to the coil. The calculation of a minimum resistance based on a maximum voltage, as performed here, is a central part of this engineering safety analysis.\n\nIn summary, the high stored energy is a consequence of the required high magnetic field for imaging. The voltage limit $V_{max}$ is a physical constraint of the magnet's construction. Together, these factors dictate the parameters ($R_{dump}$, $\\tau$) of the mandatory quench protection system.\n\nThe final computed values, rounded to three significant figures, are:\n- Stored Energy: $E = 15.6\\,\\mathrm{MJ}$\n- Minimum Dump Resistance: $R_{dump, min} = 6.00\\,\\Omega$\n- Peak Voltage Magnitude: $|V_L|_{peak} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{kV}$\n- Time Constant: $\\tau = 83.3\\,\\mathrm{s}$",
