The exponential decay model for wave amplitude in a lossy medium is fundamental. The relationship between intensity and pressure ($I \\propto p^2$) is correct for acoustic waves. The use of decibels for specifying attenuation and the frequency dependence of attenuation in tissue (approximated as linear with frequency, hence the $\\mathrm{dB/cm/MHz}$ unit) are standard concepts in the field.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and definitions to uniquely determine the value of $\\alpha$. The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from any subjective or opinion-based claims.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided information is self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for a solution. There are no missing parameters or contradictions. The numerical values are physically realistic for soft tissue.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard unit conversion and concept-application problem in acoustics. I will proceed with the detailed solution.\n\n---\n\nThe solution begins by relating the decibel (dB) scale to the physical quantities of intensity and pressure. The attenuation in decibels, $A_{\\mathrm{dB}}$, of an acoustic wave is defined based on the ratio of intensities.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_0}{I(z)}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the intensity at the reference position (depth $z=0$) and $I(z)$ is the intensity at depth $z$.\n\nThe problem states that acoustic intensity $I(z)$ is proportional to the square of the pressure amplitude $p(z)$, i.e., $I(z) = k \\cdot p(z)^2$ for some constant $k$. Therefore, the ratio of intensities is:\n$$\\frac{I_0}{I(z)} = \\frac{k \\cdot p(0)^2}{k \\cdot p(z)^2} = \\left(\\frac{p_0}{p(z)}\\right)^2$$\nwhere $p_0 = p(0)$. Substituting this into the decibel definition gives the expression for attenuation in terms of pressure amplitude:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p(z)}\\right)^2\\right) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p(z)}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem provides the physical model for pressure decay as $p(z) = p_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$, where $\\alpha$ is the linear attenuation coefficient in units of Nepers per unit length. The unit 'Neper' is intrinsically linked to the natural exponential and logarithm. From this model, the pressure ratio is:\n$$\\frac{p_0}{p(z)} = \\frac{p_0}{p_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)} = \\exp(\\alpha z)$$\nThe attenuation of the amplitude in Nepers, $A_{\\mathrm{Np}}$, is defined as the natural logarithm of the amplitude ratio.\n$$A_{\\mathrm{Np}} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{p(z)}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(\\alpha z)) = \\alpha z$$\nThis confirms that the coefficient $\\alpha$ in the given exponential model is indeed the attenuation in Nepers per unit length.\n\nNow, we will establish the relationship between $\\alpha$ and the decibel attenuation. We substitute the expression for the pressure ratio into the decibel formula:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(\\exp(\\alpha z))$$\nUsing the change of base property for logarithms, $\\log_{10}(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(10)}$, we get:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\frac{\\ln(\\exp(\\alpha z))}{\\ln(10)} = 20 \\frac{\\alpha z}{\\ln(10)}$$\nThe attenuation in decibels per unit length, which we denote as $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}}$, is therefore related to the attenuation in Nepers per unit length, $\\alpha$, by:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{dB}}}{z} = \\frac{20}{\\ln(10)} \\alpha$$\nRearranging this equation gives the conversion from $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ to $\\alpha$:\n$$\\alpha = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the specific value of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ for the given conditions. The attenuation is specified as a frequency-dependent coefficient, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{spec}} = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{dB/(cm \\cdot MHz)}$. At the operating frequency $f = 5 \\ \\mathrm{MHz}$, the attenuation coefficient in dB per centimeter is:\n$$\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{spec}} \\cdot f = (0.5 \\ \\mathrm{dB/(cm \\cdot MHz)}) \\cdot (5 \\ \\mathrm{MHz}) = 2.5 \\ \\mathrm{dB/cm}$$\n\nNow, we can convert this value to Nepers per centimeter using the derived conversion factor:\n$$\\alpha \\ [\\mathrm{Np/cm}] = (2.5 \\ \\mathrm{dB/cm}) \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(10)}{20}$$\n$$\\alpha \\ [\\mathrm{Np/cm}] = 0.125 \\cdot \\ln(10)$$\n\nThe final step is to convert the units from Nepers per centimeter to the required Nepers per meter. Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{m} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the conversion is:\n$$\\alpha \\ [\\mathrm{Np/m}] = (\\alpha \\ [\\mathrm{Np/cm}]) \\cdot (100 \\ \\mathrm{cm/m})$$\n$$\\alpha = (0.125 \\cdot \\ln(10)) \\cdot 100 \\ \\mathrm{Np/m}$$\n$$\\alpha = 12.5 \\cdot \\ln(10) \\ \\mathrm{Np/m}$$\n\nWe now calculate the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 12.5 \\cdot (2.30258509...)$$\n$$\\alpha \\approx 28.7823136... \\ \\mathrm{Np/m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\\alpha \\approx 28.78 \\ \\mathrm{Np/m}$$\nThis is the value of the linear attenuation coefficient in the exponential decay model $p(z) = p_0 \\exp(-\\alpha z)$ when $z$ is measured in meters.",

It meets all criteria for a valid problem statement. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the relationship between $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ and $G$**\n\nLet $A_{ref}$ represent the reference amplitude of an echo signal, which is the hypothetical amplitude that would be received at the transducer in the absence of any attenuation. Let $A_{att}$ be the actual amplitude of the signal received from a reflector at depth $z$, which has been reduced due to attenuation.\n\nThe purpose of Time Gain Compensation (TGC) is to apply a depth-dependent linear gain, $G$, to the attenuated signal $A_{att}$ to restore its amplitude to the reference level $A_{ref}$. The compensated amplitude, $A_{comp}$, is given by:\n$$ A_{comp} = G \\cdot A_{att} $$\n\nFor perfect compensation, the compensated amplitude must equal the reference amplitude:\n$$ A_{comp} = A_{ref} $$\n$$ G \\cdot A_{att} = A_{ref} $$\n\nFrom this, the required linear gain is:\n$$ G = \\frac{A_{ref}}{A_{att}} $$\n\nThe problem requires relating this linear gain $G$ to its corresponding value in decibels, $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$. By the definition of the decibel scale for amplitude ratios, the gain $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ is given by:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(G) $$\nThis equation is the fundamental relationship between the linear amplitude gain factor $G$ and its expression in decibels, $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$.\n\nTo connect this to the physics of attenuation, we can note that the signal loss, or attenuation, in decibels ($L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$) is defined as the ratio of the reference amplitude to the attenuated amplitude, expressed on the decibel scale:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_{ref}}{A_{att}}\\right) $$\nBy substituting $G = \\frac{A_{ref}}{A_{att}}$ into the expression for $L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$, we find:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(G) = G_{\\mathrm{dB}} $$\nThis confirms the intuitive result that the required gain in decibels must be exactly equal to the signal loss in decibels.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical computation of $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$**\n\nTo find the numerical value of $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$, we must first calculate the total attenuation of the echo signal in decibels, $L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$. As established, $G_{\\mathrm{dB}} = L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$.\n\nThe problem states that attenuation in decibels is proportional to both frequency and path length. The attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha$, is the constant of proportionality. The total attenuation $L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$ is therefore given by the formula:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = \\alpha \\cdot f_0 \\cdot d $$\nwhere $f_0$ is the center frequency of the pulse and $d$ is the total path length traveled by the pulse.\n\nFor pulse-echo imaging, the ultrasound pulse travels from the transducer to the reflector at depth $z$ and then echoes back to the transducer. The total path length is therefore the round-trip distance:\n$$ d = 2z $$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\alpha = 0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$\n- $f_{0} = 5 \\, \\text{MHz}$\n- $z = 5 \\, \\text{cm}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the round-trip distance $d$:\n$$ d = 2 \\times 5 \\, \\text{cm} = 10 \\, \\text{cm} $$\n\nNext, we substitute the given values into the attenuation formula to find $L_{\\mathrm{dB}}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = \\left(0.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{dB}}{\\text{cm} \\cdot \\text{MHz}}\\right) \\times (5 \\, \\text{MHz}) \\times (10 \\, \\text{cm}) $$\nThe units of cm and MHz cancel, leaving the result in dB.\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = (0.5 \\times 5 \\times 10) \\, \\text{dB} $$\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 25 \\, \\text{dB} $$\n\nSince the TGC gain in decibels, $G_{\\mathrm{dB}}$, must exactly compensate for the total attenuation, we have:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{dB}} = L_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 25 \\, \\text{dB} $$\nThe result is an exact integer based on the input values.",

Express the two-way echo time-of-flight $t$ in terms of $z$, $\\theta$, and $c$.**\n\nThe problem states that the one-way geometric path length from the transducer to the point reflector is $L$. The path is along the steered beam, at an angle $\\theta$ to the normal. This path length is given as:\n$$L = \\frac{z}{\\cos\\theta}$$\nThe ultrasonic pulse travels from the transducer to the reflector and the echo travels back from the reflector to the transducer. The total distance traveled, or the round-trip path length, is $2L$.\n$$ \\text{Round-trip path length} = 2L = \\frac{2z}{\\cos\\theta} $$\nThe problem provides the kinematic relationship for wave propagation in a homogeneous medium with speed $c$: distance $=$ speed $\\times$ time. For the round-trip path, the distance is $2L$ and the time is the two-way echo time-of-flight, $t$.\n$$ 2L = c t $$\nTo find $t$ in terms of $z$, $\\theta$, and $c$, we substitute the expression for $2L$:\n$$ \\frac{2z}{\\cos\\theta} = c t $$\nSolving for $t$ gives the expression for the time-of-flight:\n$$ t = \\frac{2z}{c \\cos\\theta} $$\n\n**2. Determine the functional form of the gain $G$ that exactly inverts the propagation loss.**\n\nLet $A_{ref}$ be the intrinsic amplitude of the echo generated by the point reflector. This corresponds to $A_0$ in the Beer-Lambert law context, where the propagation path starts at the reflector. The uncorrected received amplitude, which we will denote as $A_{rx}$, is the result of this initial amplitude $A_{ref}$ being attenuated over the round-trip path length of $2L$.\n\nUsing the Beer-Lambert law, $A(s) = A_0 \\exp(-\\mu s)$, for a total propagation distance $s = 2L$ and an initial amplitude of $A_{ref}$, the received amplitude is:\n$$ A_{rx} = A_{ref} \\exp(-\\mu (2L)) = A_{ref} \\exp(-2\\mu L) $$\nThe compensated amplitude, $A_{comp}$, is the product of the received amplitude $A_{rx}$ and the applied TGC gain $G$.\n$$ A_{comp} = A_{rx} \\cdot G = \\left( A_{ref} \\exp(-2\\mu L) \\right) \\cdot G $$\nThe design objective is that the compensated amplitude should be independent of depth-dependent factors, meaning it should be independent of $z$ and $\\theta$. The propagation loss is the only such factor considered. Therefore, the gain $G$ must be chosen to make $A_{comp}$ equal to a constant value proportional to the reflector's intrinsic properties, which we can set to $A_{ref}$ without loss of generality.\n$$ A_{comp} = A_{ref} $$\nSubstituting this into the previous equation:\n$$ A_{ref} = \\left( A_{ref} \\exp(-2\\mu L) \\right) \\cdot G $$\nAssuming $A_{ref}$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $A_{ref} \\exp(-2\\mu L)$ to solve for the required gain $G$:\n$$ G = \\frac{A_{ref}}{A_{ref} \\exp(-2\\mu L)} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(-2\\mu L)} $$\nTherefore, the functional form of the gain that exactly inverts the propagation loss is:\n$$ G = \\exp(2\\mu L) $$\n\n**3. Obtain a closed-form expression for the required TGC timing law $G(t(\\theta))$.**\n\nThe final step is to express the gain $G$ as a function of the measurable quantities: the echo time-of-flight $t$ and the known steering angle $\\theta$. The current expression for gain, $G = \\exp(2\\mu L)$, depends on the path length $L$. We must relate $L$ to $t$ and $\\theta$.\n\nFrom the kinematic relation established in Part 1, we have $2L = ct$.\nThis equation directly relates the round-trip path length $2L$ to the time-of-flight $t$. We can substitute $2L$ in the gain equation $G = \\exp(\\mu (2L))$ with $ct$.\n$$ G = \\exp(\\mu (ct)) $$\nThis gives the gain $G$ as a function of time $t$. Let us verify this result by following the problem's prompt to \"eliminate $z$ in favor of the measured $t$ and the steering angle $\\theta$\".\n\nWe start with the gain expression from Part 2, but substitute $L = z/\\cos\\theta$:\n$$ G = \\exp\\left(2\\mu \\frac{z}{\\cos\\theta}\\right) $$\nNext, from Part 1, we have the expression for time $t$: $t = \\frac{2z}{c \\cos\\theta}$. We solve this equation for the depth $z$:\n$$ z = \\frac{c t \\cos\\theta}{2} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $z$ into our equation for $G$:\n$$ G = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2\\mu}{\\cos\\theta} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{c t \\cos\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right) $$\nSimplifying the expression inside the exponential:\n$$ G = \\exp\\left( \\frac{2 \\mu c t \\cos\\theta}{2 \\cos\\theta} \\right) $$\nThe terms $2$ and $\\cos\\theta$ cancel in the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n$$ G(t) = \\exp(\\mu c t) $$\nThe final expression for the gain $G$ is a function of time $t$ only. The dependence on the steering angle $\\theta$ is implicitly contained within the time variable $t$ (since for a fixed depth $z$, a larger $\\theta$ results in a longer time $t$). However, the explicit functional form of the TGC timing law, $G(t)$, does not contain $\\theta$. This means the TGC amplifier can apply the correct gain based only on the time elapsed since the pulse was transmitted, without needing to know the steering angle for that particular pulse. This is a significant result for practical system implementation. The notation $G(t(\\theta))$ acknowledges that $t$ depends on $\\theta$, but the final function for the gain circuitry depends only on its input $t$.\n\nThe final closed-form analytic expression for the TGC timing law is $G = \\exp(\\mu c t)$.",
