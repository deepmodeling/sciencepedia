Before we can understand complex artifacts like shadowing and enhancement, we must master the basic calculation of how an ultrasound signal loses intensity as it travels through tissue. This practice provides a scenario to calculate the total signal loss in decibels (dB) over a round-trip path and convert this logarithmic measure back into a linear intensity decay factor, a core skill for any imaging scientist.",

            "problem": "An unfocused pulse-echo ultrasound system images a homogeneous soft tissue region with frequency-dependent attenuation. A plane wave pulse of center frequency $f=5$ megahertz travels from the transducer to a small, perfectly reflecting target located at an axial depth of $6$ centimeters and returns along the same path. The medium’s attenuation coefficient, expressed in decibels, is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{dB}}=0.5$ decibel per centimeter per megahertz. Assume that attenuation is linear in both propagation distance and frequency, and neglect any effects other than propagation loss (for example, ignore scattering other than at the target, beam divergence, and interface losses). Using the definition of the decibel (dB) for intensity ratios, determine:\n- the total round-trip attenuation in decibels, and\n- the corresponding intensity decay factor (the ratio of returned intensity to emitted intensity) as a pure decimal number without a percentage sign.\n\nReport your two results as a single row vector $\\big[$attenuation in decibels, intensity decay factor$\\big]$. If rounding is needed, round to four significant figures. The attenuation must be expressed in decibels (dB), while the decay factor is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to ultrasound attenuation: the total round-trip attenuation in decibels, and the corresponding intensity decay factor.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total attenuation. The problem provides a frequency-dependent attenuation coefficient, which we denote as $\\alpha_c$, for the soft tissue. The value is given as $\\alpha_c = 0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$. The problem states that attenuation is linear in both propagation distance and frequency.\n\nThe total attenuation in decibels, which we will call $A_{\\text{total, dB}}$, is calculated using the formula:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = \\alpha_c \\times x \\times f $$\nwhere $x$ is the total propagation distance and $f$ is the center frequency of the ultrasound pulse.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Center frequency, $f = 5 \\, \\text{MHz}$.\n- Attenuation coefficient, $\\alpha_c = 0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}$.\n- Axial depth of the target, $d = 6 \\, \\text{cm}$.\n\nThe ultrasound pulse travels from the transducer to the target and then reflects back to the transducer. This is a round-trip path. The total distance $x$ traveled by the pulse is therefore twice the axial depth $d$:\n$$ x = 2d = 2 \\times 6 \\, \\text{cm} = 12 \\, \\text{cm} $$\n\nWe can now substitute the numerical values of $\\alpha_c$, $x$, and $f$ into the attenuation formula:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = (0.5 \\, \\text{dB} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{MHz}^{-1}) \\times (12 \\, \\text{cm}) \\times (5 \\, \\text{MHz}) $$\nThe units cancel out, leaving the result in decibels:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = (0.5 \\times 12 \\times 5) \\, \\text{dB} = 30 \\, \\text{dB} $$\nThis is the first required quantity, the total round-trip attenuation.\n\nSecond, we determine the intensity decay factor. This factor is defined as the ratio of the returned intensity, $I_r$, to the emitted intensity, $I_e$. The definition of attenuation in decibels (dB) relates the intensity ratio to $A_{\\text{total, dB}}$:\n$$ A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nWe have already calculated $A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 30 \\, \\text{dB}$. Substituting this value into the equation yields:\n$$ 30 = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nTo isolate the logarithmic term, we divide both sides by $10$:\n$$ 3 = \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{I_e}{I_r} \\right) $$\nTo solve for the intensity ratio, we apply the inverse function of the base-$10$ logarithm, which is exponentiation with base $10$, to both sides of the equation:\n$$ 10^3 = \\frac{I_e}{I_r} $$\n$$ 1000 = \\frac{I_e}{I_r} $$\nThe problem asks for the intensity decay factor, which is the ratio of the returned intensity to the emitted intensity, $\\frac{I_r}{I_e}$. This is the reciprocal of the ratio we have just calculated:\n$$ \\text{Intensity decay factor} = \\frac{I_r}{I_e} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001 $$\nThis is the second required quantity.\n\nThe problem specifies that if rounding is needed, the result should be to four significant figures. The calculation from the given parameters yields exact results: $A_{\\text{total, dB}} = 30$ and the decay factor is $0.001$. To express these exact values to four significant figures, we write them as $30.00$ and $0.001000$.\n\nThe final results are an attenuation of $30.00 \\, \\text{dB}$ and a dimensionless intensity decay factor of $0.001000$. These are to be reported as a single row vector.",

            "introduction": "Building on the basic principles of attenuation, this problem explores the phenomenon of acoustic enhancement. When ultrasound waves pass through a structure with significantly lower attenuation than the surrounding tissue, such as a fluid-filled cyst, the echoes from structures located distally appear brighter than expected.

            "introduction": "This practice delves into acoustic shadowing, the counterpart to enhancement, and introduces the crucial role of Time Gain Compensation ($TGC$). Ultrasound systems apply $TGC$ to counteract attenuation and maintain uniform brightness with depth, but this compensation is based on an assumed average tissue attenuation. This exercise presents a realistic scenario where a highly attenuating lesion disrupts this balance, allowing you to calculate the resulting \"gain mismatch\" that creates a dark shadow, a key indicator for certain pathologies.",

The system's Time Gain Compensation (TGC) is calibrated so that, in this background, echoes from all depths are amplitude-equalized; that is, the TGC applies depth-dependent gain that exactly compensates the two-way (out-and-back) amplitude loss in the background medium.\n\nNow consider a planar lesion that fully occupies the ultrasound beam cross-section from the transducer surface down to a back face at depth $L=5$ centimeters (cm). The lesion has a higher attenuation coefficient $\\alpha_{\\ell}=1.2$ dB/(cm MHz). Immediately distal to the lesion’s back face (that is, just “behind” the lesion), there exists a weak point scatterer embedded in the same background material as above.

The TGC is designed to counteract the expected attenuation, but when the actual attenuation differs, a mismatch occurs.\n\nFirst, let's define the two-way amplitude attenuation in decibels (dB) for a path of length $D$ through a medium with an amplitude attenuation coefficient $\\alpha$ (in dB/(cm MHz)) at frequency $f$. The ultrasound pulse travels to the depth $D$ and back, for a total distance of $2D$. The total two-way attenuation, $A_{\\text{2-way}}$, is therefore:\n$$ A_{\\text{2-way}}(D) = 2 \\alpha f D $$\nThis is based on the problem's statement that the attenuation coefficient characterizes pressure-amplitude decay.\n\nThe system's TGC is calibrated for the background tissue, which has an attenuation coefficient $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{bg}}$.
