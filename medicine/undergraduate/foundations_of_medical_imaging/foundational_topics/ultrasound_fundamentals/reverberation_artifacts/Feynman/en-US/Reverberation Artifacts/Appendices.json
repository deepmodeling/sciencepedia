This first practice establishes the most fundamental rule governing their appearance: the relationship between the physical separation of two parallel reflectors and the resulting artifact's spacing on the ultrasound image. By deriving this relationship from first principles, you will gain a core skill for identifying reverberation and, in some cases, even deducing the distance between the structures that cause it .",

            "problem": "A focused pulsed ultrasound system forms one-dimensional axial images by mapping received echo time-of-flight to apparent depth using the constant-speed-of-sound model. Reverberation artifact arises when an emitted pulse undergoes multiple specular reflections between strong impedance mismatches, producing a sequence of delayed echoes that the imager interprets as progressively deeper structures. \n\nStarting from the following foundational facts:\n- The system maps echo arrival time $t$ to apparent depth $z$ by $z = \\frac{c t}{2}$, where $c$ is the assumed speed of sound in soft tissue.\n- For specular reflections, a round trip between two plane-parallel interfaces separated by distance $d$ adds a propagation path length of $2d$ and thus a temporal delay of $\\Delta t = \\frac{2d}{c}$ per round trip.\n\nPerform the following:\n1. Define reverberation artifact in terms of repeated specular reflections and the time-of-flight depth mapping.\n2. Derive, from the above base, an analytic expression for the characteristic axial spacing $\\Delta z$ (in depth) between successive reverberation lines produced by two parallel, perfectly specular interfaces separated by distance $d$, expressed in terms of $c$, $d$, and the round-trip time.\n3.

The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n1.  **Definition of Reverberation Artifact**\n\nReverberation artifact is a phenomenon in pulsed ultrasound imaging where false structures are displayed on the image at depths greater than a real, strongly reflecting interface. It arises when a segment of the ultrasound pulse energy becomes trapped between two highly reflective surfaces and undergoes multiple specular reflections.\n\nConsider a primary pulse emitted from the transducer. An echo is generated at a real interface and returns to the transducer. The system correctly maps its round-trip time-of-flight, $t$, to an apparent depth, $z$, using the relation $z = \\frac{ct}{2}$. However, if a portion of the pulse energy is reflected back from the transducer face (or another proximal interface) toward the real interface, it will reflect again and return to the transducer at a later time. This second echo, having traveled an extra round-trip distance, will have a total time-of-flight of $t + \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the delay from the additional round trip. The imaging system, unaware of this reverberation, misinterprets this delayed echo as originating from a deeper, fictitious interface at an apparent depth of $z + \\Delta z$. This process can repeat, creating a series of false echoes, or reverberation lines, that appear at regularly spaced intervals deeper than the true structure.\n\n2.  **Derivation of Axial Spacing ($\\Delta z$)**\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the characteristic axial spacing, $\\Delta z$, between successive reverberation lines produced by two parallel interfaces separated by a distance $d$.\n\nLet two successive echoes resulting from reverberation between these interfaces arrive at the transducer at times $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$. The time difference between their arrivals corresponds to exactly one additional round trip of the ultrasound pulse between the two interfaces.\n\nBased on the problem statement, the time delay for one round trip over the distance $d$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta t = t_{n+1} - t_n = \\frac{2d}{c}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the assumed speed of sound.\n\nThe ultrasound system maps any arrival time $t$ to an apparent depth $z$ using the formula:\n$$\nz = \\frac{ct}{2}\n$$\n\nLet $z_n$ and $z_{n+1}$ be the apparent depths corresponding to the arrival times $t_n$ and $t_{n+1}$, respectively.\n$$\nz_n = \\frac{c t_n}{2}\n$$\n$$\nz_{n+1} = \\frac{c t_{n+1}}{2}\n$$\n\nThe axial spacing, $\\Delta z$, between these successive reverberation lines is the difference in their apparent depths:\n$$\n\\Delta z = z_{n+1} - z_n\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $z_n$ and $z_{n+1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{c t_{n+1}}{2} - \\frac{c t_n}{2} = \\frac{c}{2} (t_{n+1} - t_n)\n$$\nWe know that the time difference $t_{n+1} - t_n$ is the round-trip delay $\\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{c}{2} \\Delta t\n$$\nNow, substituting the given expression for the round-trip time, $\\Delta t = \\frac{2d}{c}$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{c}{2} \\left( \\frac{2d}{c} \\right)\n$$\nThe speed of sound, $c$, cancels out, yielding the final expression:\n$$\n\\Delta z = d\n$$\nThis remarkably simple result indicates that the apparent axial spacing between successive reverberation artifacts is exactly equal to the physical distance between the two reflecting interfaces causing the reverberation. The expression has been derived from and is consistent with the given parameters $c$, $d$, and the round-trip time $\\Delta t$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n-   Separation distance, $d = 2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Speed of sound in soft tissue, $c = 1540 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n-   Center frequency, $f = 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{MHz}$\n\nUsing the derived expression from Part 2:\n$$\n\\Delta z = d\n$$\nSubstituting the given value for $d$:\n$$\n\\Delta z = 2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}\n$$\n\n**Justification of Parameter Relevance:**\n-   The distance $d = 2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ is directly used in the final expression and is the sole determinant of the artifact spacing $\\Delta z$.\n-   The speed of sound $c = 1540 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ is a fundamental parameter in the underlying physical model. It is required to relate the time delay $\\Delta t$ to the apparent depth spacing $\\Delta z$ during the derivation. However, it algebraically cancels out in the final expression for $\\Delta z$ in terms of $d$. Therefore, its specific numerical value is not needed for the final calculation if $d$ is known.\n-   The center frequency $f = 7.5 \\ \\mathrm{MHz}$ is irrelevant to this calculation. The position of reverberation artifacts is determined by the time-of-flight of echoes, which depends on path length and the speed of sound. Frequency and its corresponding wavelength ($\\lambda = c/f$) determine the *axial resolution* of the image (the ability to distinguish closely spaced objects) but do not affect the geometric mapping of time to depth in this model.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures and expressed in millimeters. The calculated value is exactly $2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $2.00 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.",

            "problem": "An ultrasound pulse-echo system uses a one-dimensional linear array transducer whose elements lie along the lateral coordinate $x$ at axial location $z=0$. Each small element is approximated as a point source that transmits and receives along its local $z$-normal line. The medium is homogeneous with constant sound speed $c$. In such systems, range reconstruction maps an echo arrival time $t$ to axial depth $z$ using $z = c t / 2$. Reverberation artifacts arise when a strong interface repeatedly returns echoes due to multiple back-and-forth bounces between the transducer face and the interface, producing a sequence of reconstructed lines separated by a constant time increment equal to the round-trip time between the transducer and the interface point involved in the ping-pong.\n\nConsider a rigid spherical reflector of radius $R$ with center at $(0, z_c)$ in the $x$-$z$ imaging plane, with $z_c  R$. Assume the following modeling assumptions, appropriate for first-principles analysis of reverberation spacing in foundational medical imaging:\n- Each array element at lateral position $x$ transmits and receives predominantly along the vertical $z$ axis (paraxial approximation).\n- The apparent reverberation at lateral position $x$ is dominated by the nearest intersection of the element’s vertical line-of-sight with the spherical surface.\n- Successive reverberation echoes for that element are separated in time by the same round-trip time between the element and the intersection point, so their axial spacing in the reconstructed image equals the one-way distance from the element to that point.\n\nUsing only these bases—the constant sound speed mapping $z = c t / 2$, the definition of reverberation ping-pong timing, and the geometry of a sphere in the $x$-$z$ plane—derive how a spherical reflector produces nonuniform reverberation spacing across lateral position. Specifically, compute the closed-form analytic expression for the axial spacing $\\Delta z(x)$ between adjacent reverberation lines as a function of the lateral coordinate $x$.

            "solution": "The derivation of the axial spacing $\\Delta z(x)$ proceeds by finding the distance from the transducer to the nearest point on the spherical reflector for each lateral position $x$.\n\n1.  **Geometric Setup**: An arbitrary transducer element is located at coordinates $(x, 0)$. The spherical reflector has radius $R$ and is centered at $(0, z_c)$, described by the equation $x_{sphere}^2 + (z_{sphere} - z_c)^2 = R^2$.\n\n2.  **Intersection Calculation**: Based on the paraxial approximation, the element at $x$ images along a vertical line. To find the intersection of this line with the sphere, we set $x_{sphere} = x$ in the sphere's equation: $x^2 + (z_{sphere} - z_c)^2 = R^2$. Solving for $z_{sphere}$ gives: $z_{sphere} = z_c \\pm \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$. This is valid for $|x| \\le R$.\n\n3.  **Determining the Reverberation Spacing**: The problem states that reverberation is dominated by the nearest intersection point. Since $z_c > R$, the nearest point to the transducer at $z=0$ is the one with the smaller axial coordinate: $z_{intersect}(x) = z_c - \\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}$.

            "problem": "An Ultrasound (US) system reconstructs axial depth from Time-of-Flight (TOF) under a homogeneous speed-of-sound assumption: it maps an echo arriving at time $t$ to displayed depth $z_{\\text{disp}} = \\frac{c_{0} t}{2}$, where $c_{0}$ is the constant assumed speed of sound. Consider a layered medium: Layer $1$ occupies $0 \\le z \\le d$ with speed $c_{1}$ and thickness $d$, and Layer $2$ occupies $z \\ge d$ with speed $c_{2}$.
