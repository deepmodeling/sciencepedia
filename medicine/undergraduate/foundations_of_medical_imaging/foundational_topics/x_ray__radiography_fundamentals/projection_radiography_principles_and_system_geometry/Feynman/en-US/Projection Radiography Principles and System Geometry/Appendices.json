Between source and detector is a stack of three planar, laterally uniform slabs placed in sequence along a single ray: an aluminum filter, a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) cover, and soft tissue.

            "problem": "A point X-ray source, detector, and patient anatomy constitute a standard projection radiography geometry. Let the source be a point $S$, the detector be an infinite plane $\\Pi_{d}$ with unit normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{d}$, and the central ray be the line through $S$ perpendicular to $\\Pi_{d}$. A small, approximately planar anatomical region of interest is modeled as a patch in a plane $\\Pi_{o}$ with unit normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_{o}$, whose center is located on the central ray.

If the maximum allowable fractional foreshortening is $0.01$, determine the maximum allowable tilt $\\theta_{\\max}$ that satisfies this tolerance. Express your answer in degrees and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let the point X-ray source $S$ be at the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, $S = (0,0,0)$. The central ray lies along the $z$-axis. The detector plane $\\Pi_d$ is perpendicular to the central ray and located at the source-to-image distance (SID) of $D_{sd} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{cm}$. The equation for the detector plane is therefore $z=D_{sd}$, and its unit normal vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_d = \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = (0,0,1)$.\n\nThe center of the object patch, denoted as $O$, is on the central ray at a source-to-object distance $D_{so}$. Its coordinates are $O = (0,0,D_{so})$. The object patch lies in a plane $\\Pi_o$ passing through $O$ with a unit normal vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_o$. The angle between the object plane and the detector plane is $\\theta$, which is the angle between their respective normal vectors, defined by $\\cos(\\theta) = \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_o \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_d$.\n\n**1. Condition for Undistorted Shape**\n\nAn object appears with an undistorted shape if the magnification is isotropic, meaning it is the same in all directions within the object plane. We can determine the condition for this by analyzing the magnification for two orthogonal directions in the object plane $\\Pi_o$.\n\nLet us orient the coordinate system such that the tilt of the object plane occurs around the $x$-axis. The normal vector to the tilted object plane is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_o = (0, \\sin\\theta, \\cos\\theta)$.\n\nFirst, consider a small vector $\\mathbf{v}_1$ in the object plane that is parallel to the axis of tilt (the $x$-axis). Let $\\mathbf{v}_1 = (\\delta x, 0, 0)$. This vector satisfies the condition $\\mathbf{v}_1 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_o = 0$. The endpoint of this vector from the object center is $P_1 = O + \\mathbf{v}_1 = (\\delta x, 0, D_{so})$. An X-ray from the source $S(0,0,0)$ passes through $P_1$ and strikes the detector plane $z=D_{sd}$ at point $P_{d1}$. By similar triangles, the coordinates of $P_{d1}$ are $(\\delta x \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}}, 0, D_{sd})$. The corresponding image vector, relative to the image center $O_d = (0,0,D_{sd})$, is $\\mathbf{v}_{d1} = (\\delta x \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}}, 0, 0)$. The magnification $M_1$ in this direction is the ratio of the magnitudes of the image and object vectors:\n$$ M_1 = \\frac{|\\mathbf{v}_{d1}|}{|\\mathbf{v}_1|} = \\frac{\\delta x \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}}}{\\delta x} = \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}} $$\nThis is the standard magnification factor, often denoted as $M$.\n\nSecond, consider a small vector $\\mathbf{v}_2$ in the object plane that is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{v}_1$ and lies in the plane of tilt (the $yz$-plane). This vector must be orthogonal to $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}_o$, so its form is $\\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, \\delta y \\cos\\theta, -\\delta y \\sin\\theta)$. The magnitude of this vector is $|\\mathbf{v}_2| = \\sqrt{(\\delta y \\cos\\theta)^2 + (-\\delta y \\sin\\theta)^2} = \\delta y$. The endpoint is $P_2 = O + \\mathbf{v}_2 = (0, \\delta y \\cos\\theta, D_{so} - \\delta y \\sin\\theta)$. The ray from $S$ through $P_2$ strikes the detector at $P_{d2}$. By similar triangles, the $y$-coordinate of the image point $P_{d2}$ is $y_{d2} = y_2 \\frac{D_{sd}}{z_2} = (\\delta y \\cos\\theta) \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so} - \\delta y \\sin\\theta}$.\nThe magnification $M_2$ in this direction is found by taking the limit as the vector becomes infinitesimally small ($\\delta y \\to 0$):\n$$ M_2 = \\lim_{\\delta y \\to 0} \\frac{|y_{d2}|}{|\\mathbf{v}_2|} = \\lim_{\\delta y \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\delta y} \\left| (\\delta y \\cos\\theta) \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so} - \\delta y \\sin\\theta} \\right| = \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}} \\cos\\theta $$\nThis effect, where the magnification depends on the orientation of the feature relative to the tilt, is known as perspective foreshortening.\n\nFor the shape to be undistorted, the magnification must be isotropic, i.e., $M_1=M_2$.\n$$ \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}} = \\frac{D_{sd}}{D_{so}} \\cos\\theta $$\nThis equation is satisfied only if $\\cos\\theta = 1$, which implies that the angle $\\theta$ must be $0$. An angle of $\\theta=0$ between the normal vectors means the object plane $\\Pi_o$ must be parallel to the detector plane $\\Pi_d$. This is the condition under which the object patch appears undistorted.\n\n**2. Maximum Allowable Tilt**\n\nThe problem defines the fractional foreshortening as $1 - \\cos(\\theta)$. This is consistent with our analysis, where the magnification along the tilt direction is reduced by a factor of $\\cos\\theta$ compared to the magnification perpendicular to the tilt direction. The fractional reduction in magnification is $\\frac{M_1 - M_2}{M_1} = 1 - \\frac{M_2}{M_1} = 1 - \\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe maximum allowable fractional foreshortening is given as $0.01$. We need to find the maximum allowable tilt angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ that satisfies this clinical tolerance. The governing equation is:\n$$ 1 - \\cos(\\theta_{\\max}) = 0.01 $$\nSolving for $\\cos(\\theta_{\\max})$ gives:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta_{\\max}) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 $$\nThe maximum angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ is the arccosine of this value. We take the principal value, as the tilt angle is physically non-negative.\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} = \\arccos(0.99) $$\nThe problem requires the answer in degrees. Using a calculator, we find the value in radians:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max, \\text{rad}} \\approx 0.1415417 \\, \\mathrm{rad} $$\nConverting this to degrees:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max, \\text{deg}} = \\theta_{\\max, \\text{rad}} \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx (0.1415417) \\times \\frac{180}{3.14159265...} \\approx 8.10984^\\circ $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested yields:\n$$ \\theta_{\\max} \\approx 8.11^\\circ $$\nThis calculation is independent of the SID, as foreshortening is a purely angular effect determined by the relative orientation of the object and detector planes.",

The grid’s lead strips are angled so that their geometric centerlines converge to a focal distance $F$ along the central axis.

            "solution": "**Part 1: Grid Cutoff Analysis**\nA focused anti-scatter grid is designed with its internal lead septa angled to align with the paths of primary X-rays originating from a specific point in space, known as the focal point. The distance from the grid to this focal point, measured along the central axis, is the grid's focal distance, denoted by $F$. The purpose of this design is to allow primary radiation to pass through the inter-septa channels unimpeded while absorbing scattered radiation, which travels at different angles.\n\nGrid cutoff occurs when the primary X-rays are intercepted by the lead septa. This happens if the X-ray source is not positioned at the grid's focal point. In this problem, the X-ray source is at a source-to-image distance $\\mathrm{SID}$ from the detector, and the grid has a focal distance $F$. The condition to be analyzed is $\\mathrm{SID} = F$.\n\nBy definition, the septa of the focused grid are angled such that their geometric extensions converge at the focal distance $F$. When the X-ray source is placed at a distance $\\mathrm{SID}$ from the detector, and it is given that $\\mathrm{SID} = F$, the source lies exactly at the convergence point of the grid septa. Since X-rays travel in straight lines, the path of every primary ray from the source to any point on the detector is perfectly aligned with the orientation of the inter-septa channel at that corresponding point on the grid. Consequently, no primary ray is blocked by the lead septa. Therefore, under the ideal conditions specified (perfect centering, $\\mathrm{SID} = F$), there is no grid cutoff of primary radiation anywhere within the field of view.\n\n**Part 2: Primary Intensity Variation**\nLet us establish a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.
