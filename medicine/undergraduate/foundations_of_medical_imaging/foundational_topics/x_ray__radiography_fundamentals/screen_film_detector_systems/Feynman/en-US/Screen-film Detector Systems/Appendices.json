For cascaded LSI systems, the overall point-spread function (PSF), which we denote as $h_{total}(x)$, is the convolution of the individual PSFs. Let $h_s(x)$ be the PSF of the screen-film system and $h_c(x)$ be the PSF of the contact imperfection.

Thinning a Poisson process results in another Poisson process.
