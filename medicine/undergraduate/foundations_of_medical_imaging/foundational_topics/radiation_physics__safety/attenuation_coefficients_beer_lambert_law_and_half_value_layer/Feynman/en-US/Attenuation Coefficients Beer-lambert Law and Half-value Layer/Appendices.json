I will proceed with the solution derivation and calculation.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nLet $I(x)$ represent the intensity of the X-ray beam at a depth $x$ into the material. The intensity is proportional to the number of photons per unit area per unit time. We consider the change in intensity, $dI$, as the beam traverses an infinitesimal thickness $dx$. This change is due to photons being removed from the beam via interactions.\n\nThe problem states that the probability, $dP$, of a single photon interacting within the path length $dx$ is given by the total effective area of the targets in a volume element of thickness $dx$ divided by the area of the beam. Consider a beam of cross-sectional area $A$. The volume of the slab with this area and thickness $dx$ is $dV = A \\cdot dx$. The number of targets within this volume is $N_{targets} = n \\cdot dV = n A \\, dx$. The total effective area presented by these targets is $A_{targets} = N_{targets} \\cdot \\sigma = (n A \\, dx) \\sigma$. The probability of interaction for a single photon is the ratio of this target area to the beam area:\n$$\ndP = \\frac{A_{targets}}{A} = \\frac{n A \\sigma \\, dx}{A} = n \\sigma \\, dx\n$$\nThe number of photons interacting in the slab $dx$, which corresponds to the decrease in beam intensity $-dI$, is proportional to the incident intensity $I(x)$ and the probability of interaction $dP$.\n$$\n-dI \\propto I(x) \\cdot dP = I(x) (n \\sigma \\, dx)\n$$\nIntroducing a constant of proportionality of $1$, we obtain the differential equation:\n$$\ndI = -I(x) (n \\sigma) \\, dx\n$$\nWe define the macroscopic linear attenuation coefficient, $\\mu$, as the product of the target number density $n$ and the microscopic cross-section $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\mu \\equiv n \\sigma\n$$\nThis allows us to write the differential equation in its standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{I(x)} = -\\mu \\, dx\n$$\nTo find the intensity $I(x)$ after the beam has traveled a distance $x$ into the material, we integrate this equation from the initial position $x=0$ (where the intensity is $I_0$) to a final position $x$.\n$$\n\\int_{I_0}^{I(x)} \\frac{dI'}{I'} = -\\int_0^x \\mu \\, dx'\n$$\nSince the material is uniform, $\\mu$ is constant with respect to position.\n$$\n[\\ln(I')]_{I_0}^{I(x)} = -\\mu [x']_0^x\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(I(x)) - \\ln(I_0) = -\\mu x\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{I(x)}{I_0}\\right) = -\\mu x\n$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the macroscopic attenuation law, also known as the Beer-Lambert law:\n$$\nI(x) = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu x)\n$$\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is defined as the average distance a photon travels before undergoing an interaction. The probability that a photon survives to a depth $x$ without interaction is $P(x) = \\frac{I(x)}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu x)$. The probability density function $p(x)$ for an interaction occurring at depth $x$ is the rate of change of the cumulative failure probability, which is $p(x) = -\\frac{dP(x)}{dx} = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu x)$.

In other words, for an infinitesimally small path length $dx$, the probability of interaction is $0.07500 \\times dx$.

It provides a characteristic length scale for the attenuation process. After traveling one mean free path, the beam's intensity is reduced to $I(\\lambda) = I_0 \\exp(-\\mu\\lambda) = I_0 \\exp(-1) \\approx 0.37 I_0$, or about $37\\%$ of its initial intensity.",

Both parts of the statement—that the HVLs are identical and that their value is approximately $1.16\\,\\mathrm{cm}$—are correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The half-value areal density (mass thickness) $m_{1/2} = \\rho\\,x_{1/2}$ is identical for A and B.**\n\nThe half-value areal density, $m_{1/2}$, is the product of the density $\\rho$ and the HVL thickness $x_{1/2}$. We can analyze this in two ways.\n\nMethod 1: Direct Calculation\nFor material A: $m_{1/2,\\mathrm{A}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{A}} \\cdot x_{1/2} = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^3) \\times (1.155...\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\approx 3.466\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\nFor material B: $m_{1/2,\\mathrm{B}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{B}} \\cdot x_{1/2} = (4.0\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^3) \\times (1.155...\\,\\mathrm{cm}) \\approx 4.621\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^2$.\nThe values are not identical.\n\nMethod 2: Derivation from First Principles\n$$ m_{1/2} = \\rho \\cdot x_{1/2} = \\rho \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\mu} $$\nSubstitute $\\mu = (\\mu/\\rho) \\cdot \\rho$:\n$$ m_{1/2} = \\rho \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{(\\mu/\\rho) \\cdot \\rho} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{(\\mu/\\rho)} $$\nThis shows that the half-value areal density is inversely proportional to the mass attenuation coefficient.\nThe problem provides $(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{A}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$ and $(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{B}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$. Since $(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{A}} \\neq (\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{B}}$, their half-value areal densities cannot be identical.\nThe statement is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. With a single, fixed photon energy and uniform slab thickness, transmission measurements alone cannot distinguish materials A and B; multi-energy measurements that exploit differences in $(\\mu/\\rho)$ as a function of $E$ can enable discrimination.**\n\nThis statement consists of two parts.\nPart 1: At a single energy ($E = 70\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), transmission measurements cannot distinguish the materials. As shown in the analysis for option A, the transmitted fraction $I/I_0$ is identical for both materials because their linear attenuation coefficients $\\mu$ are identical at this specific energy. Therefore, a simple transmission measurement cannot distinguish between them. This part is correct.\n\nPart 2: Multi-energy measurements can enable discrimination. The mass attenuation coefficients of materials are functions of photon energy, $(\\mu/\\rho)(E)$. The physical basis for attenuation (photoelectric effect, Compton scattering) has different dependencies on energy $E$ and atomic number $Z$. Materials A and B have different densities and mass attenuation coefficients at $70\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, which implies they are physically different materials (different elemental composition or mixture). The equality of their linear attenuation coefficients, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}(70\\,\\mathrm{keV}) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}(70\\,\\mathrm{keV})$, is a specific condition at one energy. It is axiomatically unlikely that this equality, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{A}}(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{A}}(E) = \\rho_{\\mathrm{B}}(\\mu/\\rho)_{\\mathrm{B}}(E)$, would hold for all energies $E$.\nBy choosing a different energy $E' \\neq 70\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, it is virtually certain that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}(E') \\neq \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}(E')$. A transmission measurement at energy $E'$ would then yield different results ($e^{-\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}(E')x} \\neq e^{-\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}(E')x}$), allowing the materials to be distinguished. This is the fundamental principle of dual-energy imaging techniques. This part is correct.\nSince both parts of the statement are correct, the entire statement is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. If $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ at one effective energy, then for a polyenergetic X-ray spectrum the two materials necessarily attenuate identically across the spectrum.**\n\nThis statement is a scientifically unsound generalization. A polyenergetic spectrum is a continuum of photon energies. The attenuation of such a beam is the sum (or integral) of the attenuation of each energy component. The total transmitted intensity is given by $I = \\int S_0(E) e^{-\\mu(E)x} dE$, where $S_0(E)$ is the incident spectrum.\nThe condition $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}$ holds only at a single energy, $E = 70\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. As argued in the analysis of option D, the functions $\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}(E)$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}(E)$ will be different at other energies. Therefore, the integrands $S_0(E) e^{-\\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}(E)x}$ and $S_0(E) e^{-\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}(E)x}$ will not be identical functions of $E$. Consequently, their integrals over the entire spectrum will not be equal in general. The two materials will not attenuate a polyenergetic beam identically. This phenomenon, known as beam hardening, leads to a different effective attenuation for different materials, even if their linear attenuation coefficients match at one particular energy.\nThe statement is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
