The solution is the radionuclide generator, where a long-lived parent isotope is shipped and decays into the desired short-lived daughter isotope, which can then be chemically separated on-site. This practice delves into the mathematical heart of this process, deriving the exact time at which the daughter's activity reaches its maximum—a critical calculation for ensuring the highest possible yield when preparing a radiopharmaceutical .",

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Law of Radioactive Decay**\nThe problem states that the per-nucleus hazard of decay, $\\lambda$, is constant. This means the probability of any given nucleus decaying in a small time interval $dt$ is $\\lambda dt$. For a large population of $N(t)$ independent radioactive nuclei at time $t$, the expected number of decays in $dt$ is the product of the number of nuclei and the probability of decay for a single nucleus. This change, $dN$, is a decrease, so we write:\n$$ dN = - (\\lambda dt) N(t) $$\nRearranging this gives the fundamental differential equation for radioactive decay:\n$$ \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables, with the initial condition that at $t=0$, the number of nuclei is $N_0$.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -\\lambda dt $$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state $(0, N_0)$ to a state $(t, N(t))$:\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} dN' = \\int_0^t -\\lambda dt' $$\n$$ \\left[ \\ln(N') \\right]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = -\\lambda [t']_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = -\\lambda t $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = -\\lambda t $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the law of radioactive decay for the number of nuclei as a function of time:\n$$ N(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\n**Derivation of Activity, $A(t)$**\nActivity, $A(t)$, is defined as the expected number of decays per unit time. This is the absolute value of the rate of change of the number of radioactive nuclei:\n$$ A(t) = \\left| \\frac{dN(t)}{dt} \\right| $$\nFrom the differential equation, we have $\\frac{dN(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda N(t)$. Substituting this into the definition of activity:\n$$ A(t) = |-\\lambda N(t)| = \\lambda N(t) $$\n(since both $\\lambda$ and $N(t)$ are non-negative quantities).\nNow, we substitute the expression for $N(t)$:\n$$ A(t) = \\lambda (N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)) = (\\lambda N_0) \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nThe initial activity, $A_0$, is the activity at $t=0$:\n$$ A_0 = A(0) = \\lambda N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot 0) = \\lambda N_0 $$\nThus, the activity as a function of time can also be written as:\n$$ A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\n\n**Justification of Units**\nThe decay constant $\\lambda$ is given in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The number of nuclei $N_0$ is a dimensionless count (atoms). Therefore, the activity $A = \\lambda N$ has units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In the context of radioactive decay, one decay per second is defined as one becquerel ($1\\ \\text{Bq} = 1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$). The exponential term $\\exp(-\\lambda t)$ is dimensionless because its argument, $\\lambda t$, has units of $(\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{s})$, which cancel out. Thus, the unit of activity throughout the process is the becquerel (Bq), consistent with its physical definition.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given:\n-   $N_0 = 2.60 \\times 10^{13}$\n-   $\\lambda = 3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $t = 2.50\\ \\text{hours}$\n\nFirst, we convert the time $t$ from hours to seconds to be consistent with the units of $\\lambda$:\n$$ t = 2.50\\ \\text{hours} \\times \\frac{3600\\ \\text{s}}{1\\ \\text{hour}} = 9000\\ \\text{s} $$\nNext, we calculate the initial activity, $A_0$, in becquerels. This is an intermediate step.\n$$ A_0 = \\lambda N_0 = (3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.60 \\times 10^{13}) $$\n$$ A_0 = 8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq} $$\nNow we can calculate the activity at $t = 9000\\ \\text{s}$:\n$$ A(t=9000\\ \\text{s}) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) $$\nFirst, compute the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\lambda t = (3.21 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (9000\\ \\text{s}) = 0.2889 $$\nNow, substitute the values into the activity equation:\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) = (8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}) \\times \\exp(-0.2889) $$\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx (8.346 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}) \\times 0.749090 $$\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx 6.251918 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in megabecquerels (MBq), where $1\\ \\text{MBq} = 10^6\\ \\text{Bq}$.\n$$ A(9000\\ \\text{s}) \\approx \\frac{6.251918 \\times 10^8\\ \\text{Bq}}{10^6\\ \\text{Bq/MBq}} \\approx 625.1918\\ \\text{MBq} $$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures as requested in the problem statement.\n$$ A(t=2.50\\ \\text{hours}) \\approx 625.2\\ \\text{MBq} $$",

The assumptions of negligible dead time and background are idealizations, but they are appropriate for creating a foundational problem to test core principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a clear and well-formulated question based on fundamental principles of radiation physics and statistics. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\n1.  **Modeling Radioactive Decay**: The problem states that decay is a memoryless process. This is the defining property of events that occur at a constant average rate, independent of past events. Such a process is a Poisson process. The activity, $A$, is defined as the expected number of decays per unit time. This is the rate parameter of the Poisson process.\n    Let $N_d(T)$ be the random variable representing the number of decays in a fixed time interval of duration $T$. Since the decay is a Poisson process with rate $A$ (in decays per second), the probability distribution of $N_d(T)$ is a Poisson distribution with mean parameter $\\lambda_d = A T$.\n    $$P(N_d(T) = k) = \\frac{(A T)^k e^{-A T}}{k!}$$\n    The expected number of decays in the interval $T$ is $E[N_d(T)] = A T$.\n\n2.  **Modeling Detection**: For each decay event, which results in the emission of one gamma photon, there is an independent probability $\\epsilon$ that this photon will be detected. This is a Bernoulli trial for each emitted photon.\n    Let $N_c(T)$ be the random variable for the number of detected counts in the interval $T$. If we knew that exactly $n$ decays occurred (i.e., $N_d(T)=n$), then $N_c(T)$ would be the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials, which follows a binomial distribution:\n    $$P(N_c(T) = j | N_d(T) = n) = \\binom{n}{j} \\epsilon^j (1-\\epsilon)^{n-j}$$\n\n3.  **Combining Decay and Detection (Thinning a Poisson Process)**: We have a random number of decays $N_d(T)$ which is Poisson-distributed, and for each of these decays, there is a probability $\\epsilon$ of detection. The resulting distribution of detected counts, $N_c(T)$, is found by considering all possible numbers of decays. This is a well-known result in probability theory: a Poisson-distributed random variable, when subjected to independent Bernoulli thinning with probability $\\epsilon$, results in another Poisson-distributed random variable.\n    The rate of the original process is $A$. The rate of the thinned process (the detection process) is $\\epsilon A$.\n    Therefore, the number of detected counts $N_c(T)$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean parameter $\\lambda_c = (\\epsilon A) T = \\epsilon A T$.\n    $$P(N_c(T) = j) = \\frac{(\\epsilon A T)^j e^{-\\epsilon A T}}{j!}$$\n\n4.  **Calculating the Expected Count Rate $R$**: The problem defines $R$ as the expected number of registered counts per unit time.\n    The expected number of counts in time $T$ is the mean of the distribution of $N_c(T)$:\n    $$E[N_c(T)] = \\lambda_c = \\epsilon A T$$\n    The expected number of counts *per unit time* is then:\n    $$R = \\frac{E[N_c(T)]}{T} = \\frac{\\epsilon A T}{T} = \\epsilon A$$\n\n5.  **Verifying Units**: The activity $A$ has units of Bq, which is $s^{-1}$. The efficiency $\\epsilon$ is a dimensionless probability. Therefore, the count rate $R = \\epsilon A$ has units of $s^{-1}$. This is consistent.\n\n**Summary of Derived Results**:\n-   The relationship between the expected count rate $R$ and the activity $A$ is $R = \\epsilon A$.\n-   The units of both $R$ and $A$ are $s^{-1}$.\n-   The number of detected counts in a fixed time gate $T$ is a random variable following a Poisson distribution with mean $\\epsilon A T$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $R = \\epsilon A$, with $R$ and $A$ both in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and the detected counts in a gate of duration $T$ are Poisson-distributed with mean $\\epsilon A T$ due to independent thinning of a Poisson process.**\n-   **Relation and Units**: The relation $R = \\epsilon A$ and the units of $s^{-1}$ for both are correct, as derived above.\n-   **Distribution**: The statement that the detected counts are Poisson-distributed with mean $\\epsilon A T$ is correct.\n-   **Reasoning**: The justification, \"independent thinning of a Poisson process,\" is the correct statistical principle that governs this phenomenon.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. $R = A/\\epsilon$, with $R$ and $A$ both in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and the detected counts in a gate of duration $T$ are binomial with parameters $n = A T$ and $p = \\epsilon$, because each decay is a Bernoulli trial.**\n-   **Relation and Units**: The relation $R = A/\\epsilon$ is incorrect. Detection efficiency is less than one, so the detected count rate must be less than the source activity, not greater.\n-   **Distribution**: The characterization of the distribution is incorrect. The number of trials for the binomial distribution, $n$, cannot be $A T$, because $A T$ is the *expected* number of decays, not a fixed integer number of decays. The number of decays is itself a random variable. The final count distribution is Poisson, not binomial.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $R = \\epsilon^{2} A$ for alpha or beta emitters due to two independent selection stages, and the detected counts in a gate of duration $T$ are Poisson-distributed with mean $\\epsilon^{2} A T$.**\n-   **Relation and Units**: The problem specifies a gamma-emitting source, making the premise about alpha or beta emitters irrelevant. Even if it were relevant, the relationship $R = \\epsilon^{2} A$ is not generally true and would require a specific physical justification for two independent selection stages, each with efficiency $\\epsilon$, which is not provided or implied. The single efficiency parameter $\\epsilon$ is defined to encapsulate *all* contributions.\n-   **Distribution**: While the form of the distribution (Poisson with mean matching the rate) is internally consistent with the faulty rate, the rate itself is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $R = A$ regardless of $\\epsilon$, because the detector samples the activity without altering it; the detected counts in a gate of duration $T$ are Poisson-distributed with mean $A T$.**\n-   **Relation and Units**: The relation $R = A$ is incorrect. It ignores the detection efficiency $\\epsilon$, which is explicitly defined as a value in $[0,1]$ that is not necessarily $1$. The detected count rate $R$ is not equal to the activity $A$ unless detection is perfect ($\\epsilon=1$).\n-   **Distribution**: The mean of the detected count distribution is given as $A T$. This is the mean of the *decay* distribution, not the *detection* distribution. The correct mean for detected counts is $\\epsilon A T$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
