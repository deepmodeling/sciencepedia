Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the exponent $n$ in the power-law relationship for the photoelectric cross-section, $\\sigma_{pe} \\propto Z^n$.\n\nThe attenuation of a monochromatic X-ray beam is described by the Beer–Lambert law. The fraction of transmitted photons, or transmission $T$, is given by:\n$$T = \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\exp(-\\mu x)$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the incident intensity, $I$ is the transmitted intensity, $\\mu$ is the linear attenuation coefficient, and $x$ is the thickness of the material.\n\nThe linear attenuation coefficient $\\mu$ can be expressed in terms of the microscopic per-atom cross-section $\\sigma$ and the number of atoms per unit volume $\\rho_a$:\n$$\\mu = \\rho_a \\sigma$$\nSubstituting this into the Beer–Lambert law gives:\n$$T = \\exp(-\\rho_a \\sigma x)$$\nThe product $\\rho_a x$ represents the number of atoms per unit area, which is defined in the problem as the atomic areal density, $N$. Thus, we can write the transmission as:\n$$T = \\exp(-N \\sigma)$$\nAccording to the problem statement, we can neglect all interactions except for photoelectric absorption. Therefore, the total cross-section $\\sigma$ is equal to the photoelectric cross-section per atom, $\\sigma_{pe}$. The equation becomes:\n$$T = \\exp(-N \\sigma_{pe})$$\nWe can solve this equation for the photoelectric cross-section $\\sigma_{pe}$:\n$$\\ln(T) = -N \\sigma_{pe}$$\n$$\\sigma_{pe} = -\\frac{\\ln(T)}{N}$$\nWe can apply this formula to both the aluminum (Al) and iodine (I) foils using the provided data:\nFor aluminum:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}} = -\\frac{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{Al}})}{N_{\\mathrm{Al}}}$$\nFor iodine:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}} = -\\frac{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{I}})}{N_{\\mathrm{I}}}$$\nThe problem states that the photoelectric cross-section follows a power-law dependence on the atomic number $Z$:\n$$\\sigma_{pe}(Z) = k Z^n$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on photon energy but is the same for both materials since the energy is fixed at $35\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. Applying this relationship to aluminum and iodine gives:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}} = k Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}^n$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}} = k Z_{\\mathrm{I}}^n$$\nTo find the exponent $n$, we can eliminate the unknown constant $k$ by taking the ratio of these two equations:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}}} = \\frac{k Z_{\\mathrm{I}}^n}{k Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}^n} = \\left(\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{I}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}}\\right)^n$$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}}}\\right) = \\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{I}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}}\\right)^n\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm power rule, $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we obtain:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}}}\\right) = n \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{I}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}}\\right)$$\nIsolating $n$ gives the final symbolic expression for the exponent:\n$$n = \\frac{\\ln(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}} / \\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}})}{\\ln(Z_{\\mathrm{I}} / Z_{\\mathrm{Al}})}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Al}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{I}}$ into this equation:\n$$n = \\frac{\\ln\\left( \\frac{-\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{I}}) / N_{\\mathrm{I}}}{-\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{Al}}) / N_{\\mathrm{Al}}} \\right)}{\\ln(Z_{\\mathrm{I}} / Z_{\\mathrm{Al}})} = \\frac{\\ln\\left( \\frac{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{I}})}{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{Al}})} \\cdot \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Al}}}{N_{\\mathrm{I}}} \\right)}{\\ln(Z_{\\mathrm{I}} / Z_{\\mathrm{Al}})}$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$Z_{\\mathrm{Al}} = 13$\n$Z_{\\mathrm{I}} = 53$\n$N_{\\mathrm{Al}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n$N_{\\mathrm{I}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{Al}} = 0.900$\n$T_{\\mathrm{I}} = 0.0560$\n\nFirst, let's evaluate the argument of the logarithm in the numerator:\n$$\\frac{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{I}})}{\\ln(T_{\\mathrm{Al}})} \\cdot \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{Al}}}{N_{\\mathrm{I}}} = \\frac{\\ln(0.0560)}{\\ln(0.900)} \\cdot \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^{19}}{1.00 \\times 10^{19}}$$\n$$\\frac{-2.88240356}{-0.10536051} \\cdot 5.00 = 27.35706 \\cdot 5.00 = 136.7853$$\nNow, let's evaluate the argument of the logarithm in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{Z_{\\mathrm{I}}}{Z_{\\mathrm{Al}}} = \\frac{53}{13} \\approx 4.076923$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{\\ln(136.7853)}{\\ln(4.076923)} = \\frac{4.91841}{1.40535} \\approx 3.4997$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested, gives:\n$$n \\approx 3.50$$",

Equivalently, it is the spatial average of the point dose $D(x)$ from $x=0$ to $x=t$.\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{t} \\int_{0}^{t} D(x) dx$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D(x)$:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{t} \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{\\text{tr}}}{\\rho} \\Phi_{0} E_{\\gamma} \\exp(-\\mu x)\\right) dx$$\nThe terms $\\Phi_{0}$, $E_{\\gamma}$, and $(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho)$ are constants with respect to $x$, so they can be moved outside the integral.\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{\\Phi_{0} E_{\\gamma} (\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho)}{t} \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-\\mu x) dx$$\nThe integral is evaluated as:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-\\mu x) dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\exp(-\\mu x) \\right]_{0}^{t} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu} (\\exp(-\\mu t) - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} (1 - \\exp(-\\mu t))$$\nSubstituting the result of the integral back into the expression for $\\bar{D}$, we obtain the final derived expression for the average dose:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{\\Phi_{0} E_{\\gamma} (\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho)}{t} \\left(\\frac{1 - \\exp(-\\mu t)}{\\mu}\\right) = \\frac{\\Phi_{0} E_{\\gamma} (\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho)}{\\mu t} (1 - \\exp(-\\mu t))$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value. First, we find the total mass energy-transfer coefficient $(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho)$ by summing the given partial coefficients:\n$$(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho) = (\\mu_{\\text{tr,pe}}/\\rho) + (\\mu_{\\text{tr,coh}}/\\rho) + (\\mu_{\\text{tr,comp}}/\\rho) + (\\mu_{\\text{tr,pp}}/\\rho)$$\n$$(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho) = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5} + 0 + 2.60 \\times 10^{-3} + 3.50 \\times 10^{-4})\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$$\n$$(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho) = (0.025 \\times 10^{-3} + 2.60 \\times 10^{-3} + 0.350 \\times 10^{-3})\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1} = 2.975 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$$\nThe given parameters in SI units are:\n- $E_{\\gamma} = 1.5\\ \\text{MeV} = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\text{J/eV}) = 2.403264951 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{J}$\n- $\\Phi_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}$\n- $t = 0.050\\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\mu = 4.40\\ \\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $(\\mu_{\\text{tr}}/\\rho) = 2.975 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$\n\nWe calculate the dimensionless term $\\mu t$:\n$$\\mu t = (4.40\\ \\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (0.050\\ \\text{m}) = 0.22$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the expression for $\\bar{D}$:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{(5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}) \\times (2.403264951 \\times 10^{-13}\\ \\text{J}) \\times (2.975 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1})}{0.22} \\times (1 - \\exp(-0.22))$$\nLet's compute the numerator and the exponential term separately.\nNumerator = $(5.0 \\times 10^{12}) \\times (2.403264951 \\times 10^{-13}) \\times (2.975 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.003574849...\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$\nExponential term = $1 - \\exp(-0.22) = 1 - 0.802518796... = 0.197481203...$\nNow, combine the parts:\n$$\\bar{D} = \\frac{0.003574849...\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}}{0.22} \\times 0.197481203...$$\n$$\\bar{D} = (0.016249315...\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}) \\times 0.197481203...$$\n$$\\bar{D} = 0.003209121...\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$$\nThe unit Joule per kilogram ($\\text{J}\\ \\text{kg}^{-1}$) is defined as the Gray ($\\text{Gy}$).\n$$\\bar{D} = 0.003209121...\\ \\text{Gy}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\bar{D} \\approx 0.003209\\ \\text{Gy}$$",
