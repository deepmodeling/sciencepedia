            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information to determine the true in situ peak rarefactional pressure. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the distinction between the \"derated\" pressure used for the on-screen display of the Mechanical Index ($MI$) and the \"true\" in situ pressure within the patient's tissue. The scanner computes the displayed $MI$ assuming a standard attenuation coefficient, which may not match the actual attenuation of the tissue being imaged.\n\nLet's define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $MI_{\\mathrm{display}}$: The Mechanical Index displayed by the scanner, given as $0.7$.\n- $f$: The center frequency of the ultrasound, given as $2\\ \\mathrm{MHz}$. We use the numerical value $f_{\\mathrm{MHz}} = 2$ in the $MI$ formula.\n- $d$: The focus depth, given as $3\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{std}}$: The standard attenuation coefficient used by the scanner for derating, given as $0.3\\ \\mathrm{dB/cm/MHz}$.\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{actual}}$: The actual attenuation coefficient of the patient's tissue, given as $0.7\\ \\mathrm{dB/cm/MHz}$.\n- $P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}}$: The peak rarefactional pressure at the focus depth, calculated using the standard attenuation model. This is the pressure value from which $MI_{\\mathrm{display}}$ is derived.\n- $P_{\\mathrm{r,true}}$: The true in situ peak rarefactional pressure at the focus in the patient's tissue, which we need to compute.\n- $P_0$: The initial peak rarefactional pressure at the transducer surface (at $d=0$), before any attenuation.\n\nThe relationship between pressure amplitude $P$ at depth $d$ and the initial pressure $P_0$ is given by the attenuation formula. The attenuation in decibels (dB) is $A = \\alpha f d$. The corresponding pressure amplitude is $P = P_0 \\times 10^{-A/20}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the derated pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}}$, from the displayed $MI$. The definition of the Mechanical Index is:\n$$MI = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}}}{\\sqrt{f_{\\mathrm{MHz}}}}$$\nRearranging for $P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}}$ and substituting the given values:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} = MI_{\\mathrm{display}} \\times \\sqrt{f_{\\mathrm{MHz}}} = 0.7 \\times \\sqrt{2}\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\n\nNext, we relate this derated pressure to the initial pressure $P_0$ using the standard attenuation model. The attenuation in decibels for the standard model is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{std}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{std}} f d$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{std}} = (0.3\\ \\mathrm{dB/cm/MHz}) \\times (2\\ \\mathrm{MHz}) \\times (3\\ \\mathrm{cm}) = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{dB}$$\nThe derated pressure is the result of applying this attenuation to the source pressure $P_0$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} = P_0 \\times 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{std}}/20}$$\nWe can solve for the initial pressure $P_0$:\n$$P_0 = P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} \\times 10^{A_{\\mathrm{std}}/20}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the true in situ pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{r,true}}$, by applying the actual tissue attenuation to the same initial pressure $P_0$. First, we compute the attenuation in decibels for the actual tissue:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{actual}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{actual}} f d$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{actual}} = (0.7\\ \\mathrm{dB/cm/MHz}) \\times (2\\ \\mathrm{MHz}) \\times (3\\ \\mathrm{cm}) = 4.2\\ \\mathrm{dB}$$\nThe true pressure is thus:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} = P_0 \\times 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{actual}}/20}$$\n\nTo find the final expression for $P_{\\mathrm{r,true}}$, we substitute the expression for $P_0$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} = (P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} \\times 10^{A_{\\mathrm{std}}/20}) \\times 10^{-A_{\\mathrm{actual}}/20}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} = P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} \\times 10^{(A_{\\mathrm{std}} - A_{\\mathrm{actual}})/20}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} = (MI_{\\mathrm{display}} \\times \\sqrt{f_{\\mathrm{MHz}}}) \\times 10^{(A_{\\mathrm{std}} - A_{\\mathrm{actual}})/20}$$\n\nLet's plug in the numerical values.\nThe difference in attenuation is:\n$$A_{\\mathrm{std}} - A_{\\mathrm{actual}} = 1.8\\ \\mathrm{dB} - 4.2\\ \\mathrm{dB} = -2.4\\ \\mathrm{dB}$$\nThe exponent in the formula becomes:\n$$\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{std}} - A_{\\mathrm{actual}}}{20} = \\frac{-2.4}{20} = -0.12$$\nNow we can compute the value of $P_{\\mathrm{r,true}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} = (0.7 \\times \\sqrt{2}) \\times 10^{-0.12}\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms:\n$$0.7 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.7 \\times 1.41421356 \\approx 0.98994949\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\n$$10^{-0.12} \\approx 0.75857758$$\nMultiplying these results:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} \\approx 0.98994949 \\times 0.75857758 \\approx 0.751036\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{r,true}} \\approx 0.751\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$$\nThe true in situ pressure is lower than the derated pressure that the machine calculates ($P_{\\mathrm{r,derated}} \\approx 0.990\\ \\mathrm{MPa}$), which is expected since the actual tissue attenuation is higher than the standard attenuation assumed by the scanner.",

Consider a weakly nonlinear tissue where the baseband, discrete-time echo from an input sequence is modeled by a second-order Volterra approximation: the output is the sum of a linear convolution and a small quadratic term. Let the PI input sequence be $x[n]$ followed by $-x[n]$.

This involves determining the peak signal from a contrast agent, $A_c$, and the peak signal from tissue leakage, $L$, in the contrast-only channel. The penalty factor is defined as $P = \\frac{A_c - L}{A_c}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the principle of Pulse Inversion for a system with a second-order nonlinearity. The system response $y$ to an input $x$ is modeled as the sum of a linear component and a quadratic component: $y(x) \\approx H_1(x) + H_2(x,x)$. The operator $H_1$ is linear, meaning $H_1(-x) = -H_1(x)$, while the operator $H_2$ is quadratic, meaning $H_2(-x, -x) = (-1)^2 H_2(x,x) = H_2(x,x)$. The PI technique sums the responses to two input pulses of opposite polarity, $x$ and $-x$. The resulting PI signal is:\n$$y_{PI} = y(x) + y(-x) = [H_1(x) + H_2(x,x)] + [H_1(-x) + H_2(-x,-x)]$$\n$$y_{PI} = [H_1(x) + H_2(x,x)] + [-H_1(x) + H_2(x,x)] = 2 H_2(x,x)$$\nThis demonstrates that the PI process cancels the linear component and doubles the quadratic component. The \"contrast-only\" channel thus contains the doubled second-order harmonic signals from both tissue and contrast agent.\n\nWe begin by calculating the peak tissue leakage amplitude, $L$. The tissue's quadratic response to a single pulse $x[n]$ is given as $\\alpha (h_2 * x^2)[n]$. Following the PI principle, the summed response from tissue in the contrast channel, which we denote as the tissue leakage signal $y_{T,PI}[n]$, is twice this quadratic component:\n$$y_{T,PI}[n] = 2 \\alpha (h_2 * (x^2))[n]$$\nThe input transmit sequence is $x[n]$, with non-zero values $x[0]=1$, $x[1]=2$, $x[2]=2$, and $x[3]=1$.\nFirst, we compute the pointwise square of this sequence, $x^2[n]$:\n$$x^2[0] = 1^2 = 1$$\n$$x^2[1] = 2^2 = 4$$\n$$x^2[2] = 2^2 = 4$$\n$$x^2[3] = 1^2 = 1$$\nSo, the sequence $x^2[n]$ has non-zero values $\\{1, 4, 4, 1\\}$.\nNext, we convolve $x^2[n]$ with the effective second-order impulse response of the tissue, $h_2[n]$, which has non-zero values $h_2[0]=0.2$, $h_2[1]=0.6$, and $h_2[2]=0.2$.
