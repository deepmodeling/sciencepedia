            "introduction": "In clinical settings, blood vessels are rarely parallel to the skin surface. To obtain a reliable Doppler signal, sonographers must electronically steer the ultrasound beam to create an appropriate angle with the vessel. This exercise explores the fundamental geometry of beam steering and its direct impact on the measured Doppler frequency shift, which is governed by the projection of the velocity vector onto the beam's propagation direction. Mastering this concept is crucial for understanding how modern ultrasound systems acquire flow data and for correctly interpreting the resulting velocities. ",

            "problem": "An ultrasound linear array is used for Color Flow Doppler imaging (CFD) in a homogeneous medium with speed of sound $c$. The array face is aligned so that the imaging vertical axis coincides with the array acoustic normal pointing into the tissue. The beam is electronically steered in-plane by an angle $\\beta$ relative to the acoustic normal, with positive $\\beta$ defined as clockwise rotation in the imaging plane. A straight vessel carries blood with constant speed magnitude $v$ whose in-plane flow direction makes an angle $\\varphi$ relative to the acoustic normal, with positive $\\varphi$ defined as clockwise rotation in the same plane. The transmit center frequency is $f_{0}$. Assume point-like backscatterers moving rigidly with the blood and neglect any out-of-plane motion.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate for a pulse-echo system, namely the definition of instantaneous frequency as the time derivative of the received signal phase and the projection of velocity onto the propagation direction, derive how beam steering changes the effective angle between the propagation direction and the flow direction. Then obtain the measured pulse-echo Doppler frequency shift $f_{d}$ as an explicit function of $\\beta$, $\\varphi$, $v$, $f_{0}$, and $c$, including the sign implied by the chosen geometry. Clearly state the sign convention for flow direction relative to the transducer in terms of the derived $f_{d}$.\n\nFinally, evaluate $f_{d}$ for the following two steering angles:\n- Case $1$: $c = 1540\\,\\text{m/s}$, $f_{0} = 5.0\\,\\text{MHz}$, $v = 0.40\\,\\text{m/s}$, $\\varphi = +30^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = +20^{\\circ}$.\n- Case $2$: $c = 1540\\,\\text{m/s}$, $f_{0} = 5.0\\,\\text{MHz}$, $v = 0.40\\,\\text{m/s}$, $\\varphi = +30^{\\circ}$, $\\beta = -25^{\\circ}$.\n\nAngles are given in degrees; when evaluating trigonometric functions, convert angles to radians.

            "solution": "The phase of the complex baseband signal, $\\phi(t)$, is determined by the round-trip path length to the scatterer. For a scatterer at position $\\boldsymbol{r}_s(t)$, this phase is:\n$$\n\\phi(t) = -2k (\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{r}_s(t))\n$$\nwhere $k = 2\\pi f_0 / c$ is the wavenumber, the factor of 2 accounts for the two-way path, and the negative sign indicates a phase lag due to propagation.

Many display conventions map positive $f_{d}$ (toward) and negative $f_{d}$ (away) to distinct colors; for example, the commonly used “Blue Away, Red Toward” mapping assigns negative shifts to blue and positive shifts to red.\n\nWe now express $v_{r}$ in terms of geometry. Let the imaging vertical axis coincide with the acoustic normal into tissue. The beam steering angle $\\beta$ rotates the propagation direction $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$ by $\\beta$ clockwise from the acoustic normal. Likewise, the flow direction is rotated by $\\varphi$ clockwise from the acoustic normal.

The sign remains negative in both cases because $\\theta_{\\text{eff}}$ stays below $90^{\\circ}$, meaning the radial component is still directed away from the transducer. In practice, the sign convention derived here informs color assignment: if the system maps positive $f_{d}$ to “toward,” then these negative shifts would be displayed as “away.” Beam steering that pushes $\\theta_{\\text{eff}}$ past $90^{\\circ}$ would flip the sign, but typical linear array steering limits (approximately $\\pm 20^{\\circ}$ to $\\pm 30^{\\circ}$) often prevent such flips for a given vessel orientation.",

            "solution": "To determine which strategies can mitigate aliasing, we must analyze the relationship between the Doppler frequency shift ($f_d$), the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF), and the imaging depth ($d$).\n\n1.  **Doppler Shift Equation:** The Doppler shift, $f_d$, is given by the formula:\n    $$f_d = \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos\\theta}{c}$$\n    where $f_0$ is the transducer's center frequency, $v$ is the velocity of the reflector (blood), $\\theta$ is the angle between the ultrasound beam and the direction of flow, and $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.

Derivation of Volumetric Flow Rate**\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q$, is defined as the volume of fluid passing through a given cross-sectional area, $A$, per unit time. From first principles, for an incompressible fluid with velocity field $\\mathbf{v}$, this is the flux of the velocity field through the surface $A$:\n$$Q = \\iint_A \\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A}$$\nIn this problem, the flow is axial within a cylindrical vessel of radius $R$. We can set up a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\phi, z)$ where the $z$-axis aligns with the vessel's axis. The velocity field is given as purely axial, so $\\mathbf{v} = v(r,t) \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The cross-sectional area is a disk in the $r-\\phi$ plane, for which the differential area element is $d\\mathbf{A} = r \\, dr \\, d\\phi \\, \\mathbf{\\hat{z}}$. The dot product thus simplifies to $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = v(r,t) r \\, dr \\, d\\phi$.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q(t)$ is obtained by integrating over the entire cross-section:\n$$Q(t) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R v(r,t) \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\phi$$\nSince the velocity field $v(r,t)$ is axisymmetric (i.e., it does not depend on the azimuthal angle $\\phi$), the integration over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$Q(t) = 2\\pi \\int_0^R v(r,t) \\, r \\, dr$$\nThis expression, derived from the fundamental definition of fluid flux, represents the volumetric flow rate in terms of the cross-sectional integration of the axial velocity field.\n\n**2. Effect of CFD Time-Averaging and Beam Angle**\n\nThe Color Flow Doppler (CFD) system operates based on the Doppler effect. The measured Doppler frequency shift, $f_D$, is related to the velocity of scatterers (red blood cells) and the geometry of insonation. The foundational relationship is:\n$$f_D = \\frac{2 f_0 v_{\\text{beam}}}{c}$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the transmitted ultrasound frequency, $c$ is the speed of sound, and $v_{\\text{beam}}$ is the component of the blood velocity vector along the direction of the ultrasound beam. For an axial velocity $v(r,t)$ and a beam angle $\\theta$ relative to the vessel axis, this component is $v_{\\text{beam}} = v(r,t) \\cos\\theta$.\n\nA CFD system estimates velocity by processing a sequence of ultrasound pulses over a finite time window. The reported color velocity at a specific spatial location represents an average over this time interval. Let the duration of the averaging window be $\\Delta t$, centered at time $t_0$. The system measures an average Doppler shift $\\bar{f}_D(r,t_0)$ and uses it to compute an estimated velocity along the beam, $\\bar{v}_{\\text{est}}(r, t_0)$.\n$$\\bar{v}_{\\text{est}}(r,t_0) = \\frac{\\bar{f}_D(r,t_0) c}{2 f_0} = \\frac{c}{2 f_0} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} \\frac{2 f_0 v(r,t) \\cos\\theta}{c} \\, dt \\right) = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} v(r,t) \\, dt$$\nTo provide a meaningful representation of the blood flow velocity, the system applies an \"angle correction,\" dividing this estimated beam-direction velocity by $\\cos\\theta$. The resulting angle-corrected CFD velocity, $\\bar{v}_{\\text{CFD}}(r, t_0)$, is what is displayed on the screen.\n$$\\bar{v}_{\\text{CFD}}(r, t_0) = \\frac{\\bar{v}_{\\text{est}}(r, t_0)}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta} \\left( \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} v(r,t) \\, dt \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} v(r,t) \\, dt$$\nThis shows that the ideal, angle-corrected CFD velocity map represents the time-average of the true axial velocity field over the window $\\Delta t$. The beam angle $\\theta$ is explicitly factored out, assuming it is known and applied correctly.\n\nThe volumetric flow calculation derived from the CFD data, $Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0)$, would therefore be the integral of this time-averaged velocity map over the cross-section:\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\iint_A \\bar{v}_{\\text{CFD}}(r, t_0) \\, dA = \\iint_A \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} v(r,t) \\, dt\\right) dA$$\nBy changing the order of integration (Fubini's theorem), this becomes:\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} \\left( \\iint_A v(r,t) \\, dA \\right) dt = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} Q(t) \\, dt$$\nThus, the CFD-derived volumetric flow is the time-average of the true instantaneous volumetric flow rate. This temporal averaging acts as a low-pass filter on the flow waveform.\n\n**3. Flow Rate Computations and Bias Analysis**\n\nFirst, we compute the instantaneous volumetric flow rate, $Q(t_0)$. We substitute the given Poiseuille velocity profile into the expression for $Q(t)$:\n$$Q(t) = 2\\pi \\int_0^R V_{\\max}(t)\\left(1 - \\frac{r^2}{R^2}\\right) r \\, dr = 2\\pi V_{\\max}(t) \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4R^2} \\right]_0^R$$\n$$Q(t) = 2\\pi V_{\\max}(t) \\left( \\frac{R^2}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4R^2} \\right) = 2\\pi V_{\\max}(t) \\left( \\frac{R^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} V_{\\max}(t)$$\nWe need the value at $t_0 = \\frac{1}{4f}$. The peak velocity at this time is:\n$$V_{\\max}(t_0) = V_0 + V_1\\sin(2\\pi f t_0) = V_0 + V_1\\sin\\left(2\\pi f \\cdot \\frac{1}{4f}\\right) = V_0 + V_1\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = V_0 + V_1$$\nUsing the given values $V_0 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$ and $V_1 = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$:\n$$V_{\\max}(t_0) = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m/s} + 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m/s} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe radius is $R = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The instantaneous flow rate is:\n$$Q(t_0) = \\frac{\\pi (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{2} (0.60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = \\frac{\\pi (9.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2)}{2} (0.60\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) = 2.7\\pi \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\nTo convert to $\\mathrm{mL/s}$, we use $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3 = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{mL}$:\n$$Q(t_0) = 2.7\\pi\\,\\mathrm{mL/s} \\approx 8.4823\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\n\nNext, we compute the CFD-derived volumetric flow, $Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0)$. Using the expression $Q(t) = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} (V_0 + V_1\\sin(2\\pi f t))$:\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\int_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2} \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} (V_0 + V_1\\sin(2\\pi f t)) \\, dt$$\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2\\Delta t} \\left[ V_0 t - \\frac{V_1}{2\\pi f} \\cos(2\\pi f t) \\right]_{t_0 - \\Delta t/2}^{t_0 + \\Delta t/2}$$\nThe first term gives $\\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} V_0$. The second term gives:\n$$\\frac{\\pi R^2 V_1}{2\\Delta t} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\pi f}\\right) [\\cos(2\\pi f(t_0+\\Delta t/2)) - \\cos(2\\pi f(t_0-\\Delta t/2))]$$\nUsing $t_0=\\frac{1}{4f}$, the arguments of the cosine are $\\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\pi f \\Delta t$ and $\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\pi f \\Delta t$. Using $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+x)=-\\sin(x)$ and $\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-x)=\\sin(x)$:\n$$-\\left[-\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t) - \\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)\\right] = 2\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)$$\nThe second part of the flow rate is $\\frac{\\pi R^2 V_1}{2\\Delta t (2\\pi f)} [2\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)] = \\frac{\\pi R^2 V_1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)}{\\pi f \\Delta t}$.\nThus,\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\frac{\\pi R^2}{2} \\left[ V_0 + V_1 \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)}{\\pi f \\Delta t} \\right]$$\nGiven $f = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ and $\\Delta t = 12\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the argument is $\\pi f \\Delta t = \\pi(4.0)(0.012) = 0.048\\pi$.\n$$\\frac{\\sin(0.048\\pi)}{0.048\\pi} \\approx \\frac{0.15016}{0.15080} \\approx 0.99576$$\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = \\frac{\\pi (3.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2}{2} \\left[ 0.40 + 0.20 \\cdot (0.99576) \\right] \\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) = 4.5\\pi \\times 10^{-6} [0.40 + 0.19915] = 4.5\\pi \\times 10^{-6} [0.59915] \\,\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s} \\approx 8.4699\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\n\nBrief comment on bias:\nThe instantaneous peak flow rate is $Q(t_0) \\approx 8.482\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$, while the CFD-derived flow rate is $Q_{\\text{CFD}}(t_0) \\approx 8.470\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$. The bias introduced by time-averaging is an underestimation of the peak flow. This occurs because the averaging window $\\Delta t$ smooths the pulsatile component of the flow. Since $t_0$ is the time of peak flow, any averaging around this point will necessarily include values lower than the peak, resulting in an average value that is less than the true instantaneous peak. This is quantified by the factor $\\frac{\\sin(\\pi f \\Delta t)}{\\pi f \\Delta t}$ being less than $1$. Regarding angle dependence, while ideal angle correction removes bias, any error in the operator's estimation of $\\theta$ would introduce a significant systematic error, as the correction factor $1/\\cos\\theta$ is highly sensitive to changes in $\\theta$, especially for large angles.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe problem asks for the instantaneous volumetric flow rate at $t_0$, rounded to four significant figures and expressed in $\\mathrm{mL/s}$. As calculated in Part 3:\n$$Q(t_0) = 2.7\\pi\\,\\mathrm{mL/s} \\approx 8.482300... \\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $8.482\\,\\mathrm{mL/s}$.",
