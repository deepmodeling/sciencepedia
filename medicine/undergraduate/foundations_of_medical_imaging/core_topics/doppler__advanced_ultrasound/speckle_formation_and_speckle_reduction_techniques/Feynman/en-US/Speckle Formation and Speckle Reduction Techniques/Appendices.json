            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in the statistical physics of medical imaging. We are given a model for the complex field $U = X + \\mathrm{j}Y$, where $X$ and $Y$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) zero-mean Gaussian random variables, $X, Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. We need to derive the contrast for the intensity $I = X^2 + Y^2$ and the amplitude $A = \\sqrt{I}$.\n\nFirst, we find the probability density functions (PDFs) for the amplitude $A$ and intensity $I$. The joint PDF of $X$ and $Y$ is given by the product of their individual PDFs due to independence:\n$$ p_{X,Y}(x,y) = p_X(x) p_Y(y) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2+y^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nTo find the PDF of the amplitude $A$, we transform from Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ to polar coordinates $(a,\\theta)$, where $x=a\\cos\\theta$ and $y=a\\sin\\theta$. The amplitude is $A=a=\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and the phase is $\\Theta=\\theta=\\arctan(y/x)$. The Jacobian of this transformation is $|J| = a$. Using the change of variables formula, the joint PDF for $A$ and $\\Theta$ is:\n$$ p_{A,\\Theta}(a,\\theta) = p_{X,Y}(a\\cos\\theta, a\\sin\\theta) |J| = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) a $$\nThis is valid for $a \\ge 0$ and $0 \\le \\theta  2\\pi$. To find the marginal PDF for the amplitude $A$, we integrate over all possible values of $\\theta$:\n$$ p_A(a) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} p_{A,\\Theta}(a,\\theta) d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{a}{2\\pi\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) d\\theta = \\frac{a}{\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nThis is the Rayleigh distribution for $a \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the moments of the amplitude $A$. The $k$-th moment of $A$ is given by $\\mathbb{E}[A^k] = \\int_0^\\infty a^k p_A(a) da$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^k] = \\int_0^\\infty a^k \\frac{a}{\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) da = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\int_0^\\infty a^{k+1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{a^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) da $$\nLet $z = a^2/(2\\sigma^2)$, which implies $a = \\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 z}$ and $da = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2z}}dz$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^k] = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\int_0^\\infty (\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2 z})^{k+1} \\exp(-z) \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2z}} dz = \\frac{(2\\sigma^2)^{(k+1)/2}}{\\sigma^2} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}} \\int_0^\\infty z^{(k+1)/2} z^{-1/2} \\exp(-z) dz $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^k] = (2\\sigma^2)^{k/2} \\int_0^\\infty z^{k/2} \\exp(-z) dz $$\nThe integral is the Gamma function $\\Gamma(s) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{s-1}e^{-t} dt$ with $s = k/2+1$. Thus, the general expression for the $k$-th moment of a Rayleigh-distributed variable is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^k] = (2\\sigma^2)^{k/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{k}{2}+1\\right) $$\nNow we can compute the required moments for the amplitude contrast $C_A = \\sigma_A/\\mu_A$.\nMean amplitude $\\mu_A = \\mathbb{E}[A]$ (for $k=1$):\n$$ \\mu_A = (2\\sigma^2)^{1/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+1\\right) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\sigma\\sqrt{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} $$\nMean-square amplitude $\\mathbb{E}[A^2]$ (for $k=2$):\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^2] = (2\\sigma^2)^{2/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{2}{2}+1\\right) = 2\\sigma^2 \\Gamma(2) = 2\\sigma^2 (1!) = 2\\sigma^2 $$\nThe variance of the amplitude is $\\sigma_A^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(A) = \\mathbb{E}[A^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[A])^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_A^2 = 2\\sigma^2 - \\left(\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\\right)^2 = 2\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\sigma^2\\left(2-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) $$\nThe amplitude contrast $C_A$ is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$ C_A = \\frac{\\sigma_A}{\\mu_A} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2(2-\\pi/2)}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2-\\pi/2}{\\pi/2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4-\\pi}{\\pi}} $$\n\nNext, we derive the intensity contrast $C = \\sigma_I/\\mu_I$.

We have already calculated this:\n$$ \\mu_I = 2\\sigma^2 $$\nTo find the variance $\\sigma_I^2 = \\mathbb{E}[I^2] - (\\mu_I)^2$, we first need $\\mathbb{E}[I^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(A^2)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[A^4]$. Using the general moment formula for $A$ with $k=4$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A^4] = (2\\sigma^2)^{4/2} \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{4}{2}+1\\right) = (2\\sigma^2)^2 \\Gamma(3) = 4\\sigma^4 (2!) = 8\\sigma^4 $$\nThe variance of the intensity is:\n$$ \\sigma_I^2 = \\mathbb{E}[A^4] - (\\mathbb{E}[A^2])^2 = 8\\sigma^4 - (2\\sigma^2)^2 = 8\\sigma^4 - 4\\sigma^4 = 4\\sigma^4 $$\nThe intensity contrast $C$ is the ratio of the standard deviation of intensity $\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{4\\sigma^4} = 2\\sigma^2$ to the mean intensity $\\mu_I$:\n$$ C = \\frac{\\sigma_I}{\\mu_I} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{2\\sigma^2} = 1 $$\nThis is a classic result for fully developed, single-look speckle.\n\nThe problem could also be solved by first finding the PDF of intensity $I=A^2$. Using $p_I(i)di = p_A(a)da$ and $a=\\sqrt{i}$, we get $da/di=1/(2\\sqrt{i})$.\n$$ p_I(i) = p_A(\\sqrt{i})\\left|\\frac{da}{di}\\right| = \\frac{\\sqrt{i}}{\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{i}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) $$\nThis is a negative exponential distribution for $i \\ge 0$ with mean $\\mu_I = 2\\sigma^2$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_I = 2\\sigma^2$. Hence, $C = \\sigma_I/\\mu_I = 1$. This confirms the result.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $(C, C_A)$. We have found $C=1$ and $C_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{4-\\pi}{\\pi}}$.",

            "problem": "In coherent Medical Ultrasound (US) imaging, speckle arises from the random interference of echoes from many unresolved scatterers, yielding a stochastic image intensity. Consider a pixel whose single-look intensity, denoted by $I_{k}$ for look index $k$, is generated under fully developed speckle conditions and is modeled as an exponential random variable with mean $\\mu$, where $k = 1, 2, \\dots, L$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is based on standard, validated models of speckle formation and reduction in medical ultrasound imaging. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe objective is to derive a closed-form expression for the speckle contrast, $C$, of a multi-look compounded image intensity, $I$. The speckle contrast is defined as:\n$$C = \\frac{\\sigma_{I}}{\\mu_{I}}$$\nwhere $\\mu_{I}$ is the mean of the compounded intensity $I$, and $\\sigma_{I}$ is its standard deviation.\n\nThe compounded intensity $I$ is formed by the arithmetic mean of $L$ independent single-look intensities, $I_k$:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}$$\nEach single-look intensity $I_k$ is modeled as an exponential random variable with a mean $\\mu$. The problem states that the $L$ looks are statistically independent and have an equal mean.\n\nFirst, we will determine the mean of the compounded intensity, $\\mu_I$. By the definition of expectation:\n$$\\mu_I = E[I] = E\\left[\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right]$$\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator, we can write:\n$$\\mu_I = \\frac{1}{L} E\\left[\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right] = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=1}^{L} E[I_{k}]$$\nWe are given that each look $I_k$ has the same mean, $E[I_k] = \\mu$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\\mu_I = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\mu = \\frac{1}{L} (L \\mu)$$\n$$\\mu_I = \\mu$$\nThis shows that the mean intensity of the compounded image is the same as the mean intensity of any single look.\n\nNext, we determine the standard deviation of the compounded intensity, $\\sigma_I$. We begin by calculating the variance, $\\sigma_I^2 = \\text{Var}(I)$.\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\text{Var}(I) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of variance, $\\text{Var}(aX) = a^2 \\text{Var}(X)$, where $a$ is a constant:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right)$$\nA critical condition provided is that the $L$ looks, $I_k$, are statistically independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{L} I_{k}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\text{Var}(I_k)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\sigma_I^2$:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\text{Var}(I_k)$$\nWe must now find the variance of a single-look intensity, $\\text{Var}(I_k)$. The problem states that $I_k$ is an exponential random variable with mean $\\mu$. A well-known property of the exponential distribution is that its variance is equal to the square of its mean. Therefore:\n$$\\text{Var}(I_k) = \\mu^2$$\nSince all looks have the same mean $\\mu$, they all have the same variance $\\mu^2$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\sigma_I^2$:\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{L} \\mu^2 = \\frac{1}{L^2} (L \\mu^2)$$\n$$\\sigma_I^2 = \\frac{\\mu^2}{L}$$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_I$ is the square root of the variance. Since intensity and its mean $\\mu$ are non-negative physical quantities, we have:\n$$\\sigma_I = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu^2}{L}} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{L}}$$\n\nFinally, we can compute the speckle contrast $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\sigma_{I}}{\\mu_{I}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{L}}}{\\mu}$$\n$$C = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L}}$$\n\nThe physical-statistical assumptions required for this derivation to hold are:\n1.  **Fully Developed Speckle**: The signal is a result of coherent summation of echoes from a large number of randomly-phased, unresolved scatterers within each resolution cell. This is the fundamental condition that gives rise to the negative exponential probability distribution for the intensity.\n2.  **Exponential Intensity Statistics**: As a direct consequence of the fully developed speckle condition, the intensity of a single, un-averaged look, $I_k$, must follow a negative exponential distribution, for which the standard deviation is equal to the mean. For this model, the single-look speckle contrast is $C_1 = \\mu / \\mu = 1$.\n3.  **Statistical Independence of Looks**: The $L$ separate looks, $I_k$, must be statistically independent from one another. This ensures that their speckle patterns are uncorrelated, which is the mathematical basis for the variance of the sum being the sum of the variances. In practice, this is achieved by techniques such as spatial compounding (acquiring images from different angles) or frequency compounding (using different transducer frequency bands), where the separation between looks is sufficient to ensure decorrelation.\n4.  **Equal Mean Intensity Across Looks**: All $L$ looks are assumed to have the same underlying mean intensity $\\mu$. This implies that the underlying tissue reflectivity is constant across the regions from which the looks are gathered and that any systematic variations, such as system gain or attenuation, have been perfectly compensated for.",

The PDF is $f(I) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} e^{-I/\\mu}$ for $I \\ge 0$.\nThe moments of this distribution are $E[I^k] = \\mu^k k!$.\n-   $E[I] = \\mu$.\n-   $E[I^2] = 2\\mu^2$.\n\nThe estimator $\\hat C$ is a function of the sample moments $\\bar I$ and $m_2$. For a large sample size ($N=400$ is sufficient), we can use the multivariate Central Limit Theorem and the delta method to find the asymptotic distribution of $\\hat C$.\n\nThe vector of sample moments $\\begin{pmatrix} \\bar I \\\\ m_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ is asymptotically normal. By the delta method, any smooth function of these moments is also asymptotically normal.\nThe estimator $\\hat C = g(\\bar I, m_2)$, where $g(x,y) = \\sqrt{y-x^2}/x$.\nThe asymptotic distribution of $\\hat C$ for large $N$ is given by:\n$$ \\sqrt{N}(\\hat C - C) \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2_{asymp}) $$\nwhere $C$ is the true contrast and $\\sigma^2_{asymp}$ is the asymptotic variance. Under $H_0$, $C=1$.\n\nA key result from statistical theory for an exponential distribution is that the asymptotic variance of the sample coefficient of variation ($\\hat C$) is exactly $1$. A detailed derivation involves calculating the gradient of $g(x,y)$ and the covariance matrix of $(I, I^2)$ and is computationally intensive, but the result is standard.\nThe gradient of $g(x,y)$ is $\\nabla g = (\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y})^T$.

Under $H_0$, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n-   **Significance Level**: $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n-   **Test Type**: This is a left-tailed test since the alternative is $H_1: C1$. We reject $H_0$ if the observed test statistic is unusually small.\n-   **Critical Value**: The critical value for a standard normal distribution at $\\alpha=0.05$ for a left-tailed test is $z_{0.05} = \\Phi^{-1}(0.05)$, where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal CDF. $z_{0.05} \\approx -1.6449$.\n-   **Rejection Rule**: Reject $H_0$ if $Z_{obs}  -1.6449$.\n\nNow, we use the given data:\n-   $N=400$, so $\\sqrt{N}=20$.\n-   Observed estimator value: $\\hat C = 0.92$.\n\nCalculate the observed test statistic:\n$$ Z_{obs} = \\sqrt{400}(0.92 - 1) = 20(-0.08) = -1.60 $$\n\n**Decision**:\nCompare the observed statistic to the critical value:\n$Z_{obs} = -1.60$ is not less than the critical value $-1.6449$.\nSince $-1.60  -1.6449$, the result does not fall into the rejection region. Therefore, we **do not reject** the null hypothesis $H_0$.\n\n**P-value Calculation**:\nThe p-value is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the one observed, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n$$ p\\text{-value} = P(Z \\le Z_{obs}) = P(Z \\le -1.60) = \\Phi(-1.60) $$\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, $\\Phi(-1.60) \\approx 0.0548$.\nSince the p-value ($0.0548$) is greater than the significance level $\\alpha$ ($0.05$), we **do not reject** $H_0$.\n\nThe data do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the speckle contrast is less than $1$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Use the exponential model implied by Rayleigh amplitude: under $H_0$, $C=1$. By the multivariate Central Limit Theorem and the delta method applied to $(\\bar I, m_2)$, $\\hat C$ is approximately distributed as $\\mathcal N(1, 1/N)$ for large $N$. A level-$\\alpha$ left-tailed test rejects $H_0$ if $\\hat C  1 + \\Phi^{-1}(\\alpha)/\\sqrt{N}$, where $\\Phi$ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function. With $N=400$ and $\\alpha=0.05$, the critical threshold is $1 - 1.6449/20 \\approx 0.9178$. Since $0.92  0.9178$, do not reject $H_0$. The $p\\text{-value}$ is $\\Phi\\!\\big( \\sqrt{N}(\\hat C - 1) \\big) = \\Phi(-1.6) \\approx 0.0548$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies the theoretical basis for the test (exponential model, CLT, delta method). It correctly states the asymptotic distribution of $\\hat C$ as $\\mathcal{N}(1, 1/N)$. It formulates the correct left-tailed test and rejection region for $\\hat C$. The numerical calculation of the critical threshold ($1 - 1.6449/20 \\approx 0.9178$) is correct. The comparison of the observed value ($\\hat C = 0.92$) to this threshold ($0.92  0.9178$) is correct, leading to the correct decision not to reject $H_0$. The p-value calculation is also entirely correct.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Use a two-sided normal test for $\\hat C$ with variance $1/N$ and reject $H_0$ if $|\\hat C - 1|  z_{0.975}/\\sqrt{N}$, where $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$. With $N=400$, the threshold is $1 \\pm 0.098$, and since $0.92  0.902$, reject $H_0$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option incorrectly proposes a two-sided test, which contradicts the physically motivated one-sided alternative $H_1: C1$. Furthermore, it contains a clear numerical error: the statement \"since $0.92  0.902$\" is false. Even if the test were appropriate, the conclusion is based on a false premise.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Model the envelope amplitude as Rayleigh and test $H_0: C = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1} \\approx 0.52$ for the observed $\\hat C = 0.92$. Since $0.92$ is much larger than $0.52$, reject $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.05$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option confuses the contrast of the intensity with the contrast of the amplitude. The problem defines the data $\\{I_i\\}$ and the estimator $\\hat C$ in terms of intensity. The theoretical contrast for intensity under the model is $C=1$. The value $\\approx 0.52$ is the theoretical contrast for the *amplitude* ($C_A = \\sqrt{4/\\pi - 1}$), not the intensity. The option therefore tests the wrong null hypothesis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Treat the sample variance as if intensities were Gaussian and use a chi-square test on $(N-1)s^2/\\mu^2$ with $(N-1)$ degrees of freedom (where $s^2$ uses the $(N-1)$ denominator). Reject $H_0$ at $\\alpha = 0.05$ because the observed $\\hat C = 0.92$ is below $1$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option makes two major errors. First, it applies a test valid only for Gaussian-distributed data, whereas the problem explicitly states the data are exponentially distributed. Second, its rejection criterion (\"Reject $H_0$... because the observed $\\hat C = 0.92$ is below $1$\") is not a valid statistical procedure. A formal test requires comparing the observed statistic to a critical value derived from its sampling distribution, not just noting its position relative to the null value.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Estimate the effective number of looks by $\\hat L = \\hat C^{-2}$ and reject $H_0$ if $\\hat L  1$. Since $\\hat C = 0.92$ gives $\\hat L \\approx 1.18  1$, reject $H_0$.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option uses the correct physical relationship between contrast and the number of looks ($L=C^{-2}$), and correctly reformulates the test as $H_0: L=1$ vs $H_1: L1$. However, its rejection rule is flawed. It rejects $H_0$ simply because the point estimate $\\hat L$ is greater than the hypothesized value of $1$. This is statistically invalid. An estimator is a random variable; it will almost never be exactly equal to the true value. A valid test must account for this sampling variability to determine if the observed deviation is statistically significant. This \"test\" would have a Type I error rate of approximately $50\\%$, not the required $\\alpha=0.05$.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",
