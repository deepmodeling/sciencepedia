A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of two key performance limits of a pulsed-wave Doppler system from first principles.\n\n**1. Maximum Unaliased Doppler Frequency ($f_{D,max}$)**\n\nThe a priori principle is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem, which states that to reconstruct a signal without aliasing, its sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice its highest frequency component. The problem states that the Doppler signal is sampled once every transmit pulse. Therefore, the sampling frequency of the Doppler signal is equal to the pulse repetition frequency ($\\text{PRF}$).\n$$f_s = \\text{PRF}$$\nLet $f_D$ be the Doppler frequency shift. The Nyquist criterion requires that:\n$$f_s > 2 |f_D|$$\nThe maximum Doppler frequency that can be measured without aliasing, $f_{D,max}$, corresponds to the limit of this inequality, known as the Nyquist frequency.\n$$f_s = 2 f_{D,max}$$\nSubstituting $f_s = \\text{PRF}$, we derive the relationship for the maximum unaliased Doppler frequency:\n$$\\text{PRF} = 2 f_{D,max}$$\n$$f_{D,max} = \\frac{\\text{PRF}}{2}$$\nGiven $\\text{PRF} = 8\\ \\mathrm{kHz} = 8000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$f_{D,max} = \\frac{8000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}}{2} = 4000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nExpressing this in kilohertz as requested and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$f_{D,max} = 4.000\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\n\n**2. Maximum Unambiguous Range Depth ($d_{max}$)**\n\nThe a priori principle is based on the time of flight of an ultrasound pulse. The system transmits a pulse and then \"listens\" for the returning echo. To avoid range ambiguity, the echo from a target at a given depth must be received before the next pulse is transmitted.\n\nThe time interval between consecutive pulses is the pulse repetition period, $T_{PRP}$, which is the reciprocal of the pulse repetition frequency:\n$$T_{PRP} = \\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}$$\nAn ultrasound pulse travels a total distance of $2d$ for a target at depth $d$ (down and back). The time required for this two-way travel, or time of flight $t_{flight}$, is given by:\n$$t_{flight} = \\frac{2d}{c}$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of sound.\n\nThe condition for unambiguous range is that the time of flight from the maximum depth, $d_{max}$, must be equal to the pulse repetition period:\n$$t_{flight} = T_{PRP}$$\n$$\\frac{2 d_{max}}{c} = \\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}$$\nSolving for $d_{max}$, we derive the formula for the maximum unambiguous range:\n$$d_{max} = \\frac{c}{2 \\cdot \\text{PRF}}$$\nGiven $c = 1540\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ and $\\text{PRF} = 8000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$ (or $8000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$):\n$$d_{max} = \\frac{1540\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{2 \\times 8000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1540}{16000}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 0.09625\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting this to centimeters as requested:\n$$d_{max} = 0.09625\\ \\mathrm{m} \\times 100\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}}{\\mathrm{m}} = 9.625\\ \\mathrm{cm}$$\nThis value is already at four significant figures.\n\n**Effect of PRF on Depth Reach**\n\nFrom the derived equation $d_{max} = \\frac{c}{2 \\cdot \\text{PRF}}$, it is evident that the maximum unambiguous depth, $d_{max}$, is inversely proportional to the pulse repetition frequency, $\\text{PRF}$. Increasing the $\\text{PRF}$ reduces the time interval between pulses ($T_{PRP}$). This shorter \"listening\" window means that echoes from deeper structures do not have enough time to return to the transducer before the next pulse is sent out, leading to range ambiguity. Consequently, a higher $\\text{PRF}$ allows for the measurement of higher Doppler frequencies but simultaneously reduces the maximum depth that can be unambiguously examined. This fundamental trade-off is known as the range-velocity ambiguity in Doppler ultrasound.\n\nThe final two numbers to be reported are:\n(i) Maximum unaliased Doppler frequency: $4.000\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$\n(ii) Maximum unambiguous depth: $9.625\\ \\mathrm{cm}$",

The task is to find the range of PRF values that satisfies both constraints and then to select a specific value based on a clearly defined optimization goal (maximize depth margin while satisfying the velocity requirement). This structure allows for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution. There are no contradictions or missing parameters.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard and well-posed problem in the field of medical imaging physics that tests the understanding of the fundamental trade-off between maximum measurable velocity and maximum unambiguous imaging depth. The solution process may now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe goal is to determine the admissible range for the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) that avoids both range ambiguity and Doppler aliasing, and then select an optimal PRF based on the given criteria. This requires establishing an upper and a lower bound on the PRF.\n\n**1. Upper Bound on PRF due to Range Ambiguity**\n\nThe first constraint is the requirement to image unambiguously to a depth $d_{\\mathrm{req}}$. This is governed by the principle of two-way time-of-flight.\n- An ultrasound pulse is transmitted and travels to a scatterer at depth $d$. The pulse is reflected and travels back to the transducer. The total travel distance is $2d$.\n- The time taken for this round trip, $t_{\\text{round-trip}}$, is given by:\n$$t_{\\text{round-trip}} = \\frac{2d}{c}$$\n- To avoid range ambiguity, the echo from the maximum required depth, $d_{\\mathrm{req}}$, must be received before the next pulse is transmitted. The time between consecutive pulses is the pulse repetition period, $T_p$, which is the reciprocal of the PRF.\n$$T_p = \\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}$$\n- The condition to prevent range ambiguity is thus $t_{\\text{round-trip}} \\le T_p$ for $d = d_{\\mathrm{req}}$.\n$$\\frac{2d_{\\mathrm{req}}}{c} \\le \\frac{1}{\\text{PRF}}$$\n- Rearranging this inequality provides the upper bound on the PRF:\n$$\\text{PRF} \\le \\frac{c}{2d_{\\mathrm{req}}}$$\n\n**2. Lower Bound on PRF due to Doppler Aliasing**\n\nThe second constraint is the requirement to measure blood velocities up to $v_{\\max}$ without aliasing. This is governed by the Doppler effect and the Nyquist sampling theorem.\n- According to the classical Doppler frequency shift relation for backscattered ultrasound, the Doppler shift $f_d$ is proportional to the component of the scatterer's velocity $v$ along the ultrasound beam axis.\n- The velocity component along the beam is $v \\cos(\\theta)$. The Doppler shift for a moving scatterer is given by:\n$$f_d = \\frac{2 f_0 v \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\n- To measure the maximum expected velocity $v_{\\max}$ without aliasing, we must be able to properly sample the maximum corresponding Doppler frequency shift, $f_{d,\\max}$.\n$$f_{d,\\max} = \\frac{2 f_0 v_{\\max} \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\n- The Shannon–Nyquist sampling theorem states that to reconstruct a signal containing frequencies up to a maximum of $f_{d,\\max}$, the sampling rate must be at least twice this maximum frequency. In pulsed Doppler, the sampling rate is the PRF.\n$$\\text{PRF} \\ge 2 f_{d,\\max}$$\n- Substituting the expression for $f_{d,\\max}$ gives the lower bound on the PRF:\n$$\\text{PRF} \\ge 2 \\left( \\frac{2 f_0 v_{\\max} \\cos(\\theta)}{c} \\right) = \\frac{4 f_0 v_{\\max} \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\n\n**3. Admissible PRF Range**\n\nCombining the upper and lower bounds yields the full admissible range for the PRF:\n$$\\frac{4 f_0 v_{\\max} \\cos(\\theta)}{c} \\le \\text{PRF} \\le \\frac{c}{2d_{\\mathrm{req}}}$$\nFor a solution to exist, the lower bound must be less than or equal to the upper bound.\n\n**4. Principled PRF Selection and Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for a selection strategy that \"guarantees unaliased measurement of the expected maximum speed while preserving as much depth margin as possible.\"\n- The maximum unambiguous imaging depth, $d_{\\max}$, is related to the PRF by $d_{\\max} = \\frac{c}{2 \\cdot \\text{PRF}}$.\n- To maximize the depth ($d_{\\max}$) and thus the depth margin, the PRF must be minimized.\n- The minimum possible PRF that still guarantees unaliased measurement of $v_{\\max}$ is the lower bound of the admissible range.\n- Therefore, the recommended PRF, $\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}}$, is:\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{4 f_0 v_{\\max} \\cos(\\theta)}{c}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $f_{0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}$ Hz\n- $v_{\\max} = 0.90$ m/s\n- $\\theta = 20^{\\circ}$\n- $c = 1540$ m/s\n\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{4 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{6}) \\times (0.90) \\times \\cos(20^{\\circ})}{1540}$$\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{7} \\times \\cos(20^{\\circ})}{1540}$$\nUsing the value $\\cos(20^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.9396926$:\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} \\approx \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{7} \\times 0.9396926}{1540}$$\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} \\approx \\frac{16914467.17}{1540}$$\n$$\\text{PRF}_{\\text{rec}} \\approx 10983.42 \\text{ Hz}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $10980$ Hz.

Tissue (clutter) echoes are concentrated near zero frequency.

The filter has a stopband for $0 \\leq f \\leq f_{s}$ with $f_{s} = 100$ Hz, a transition band for $f_{s} < f < f_{p}$ with $f_{p} = 200$ Hz, and a passband for $f \\geq f_{p}$.

We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compare the mean velocity estimated from an ideal, unfiltered Doppler spectrum with the mean velocity estimated from a spectrum that has been altered by a high-pass filter. The difference between these two estimates is the velocity bias.\n\nFirst, we determine the \"true\" mean velocity, which is derived from the unfiltered Doppler power spectral density, $S_{b}(f)$. The problem states that $S_{b}(f)$ is a rectangular spectrum of constant amplitude, which we can denote as $A$, on the interval $[f_{L}, f_{U}]$, and zero elsewhere. The lower and upper frequency limits are given as $f_{L} = 150$ Hz and $f_{U} = 450$ Hz.\n\nThe true mean Doppler frequency, $\\bar{f}_{\\text{true}}$, is the first spectral moment of $S_{b}(f)$ normalized by its total power (zeroth spectral moment).
