For a wave propagating in a stationary medium with speed $c$, the round-trip propagation delay to a scatterer at range $r(t)$ is $\\tau(t) = \\frac{2 r(t)}{c}$.

The instantaneous phase of $s_{r}(t)$ is $\\phi(t) = 2\\pi f_{0}\\big(t - \\tau(t)\\big)$. The instantaneous frequency is $f_{\\text{inst}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{d\\phi}{dt} = f_{0}\\big(1 - \\frac{d\\tau}{dt}\\big)$, so the baseband Doppler shift (difference from $f_{0}$) is $f_{D}(t) = - f_{0}\\,\\frac{d\\tau}{dt}$.\n\n3.

            "problem": "An ultrasound system configured for pulsed wave Doppler samples the backscattered signal at the Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF). The spectral display shows the frequency content of the sampled Doppler signal relative to a baseline, where positive Doppler frequencies are plotted above the baseline (interpreted as flow toward the transducer) and negative Doppler frequencies are plotted below the baseline (interpreted as flow away from the transducer). Consider a vessel with a true continuous Doppler frequency shift of $f_{D} = 3.2\\ \\text{kHz}$ and a sampling PRF of $\\text{PRF} = 5\\ \\text{kHz}$. Starting from the fundamental idea that sampling at frequency $f_{s}$ maps any continuous spectral component at frequency $f$ into the discrete-time baseband interval $[-f_{s}/2,\\, f_{s}/2]$ by integer shifts of $f_{s}$, determine the aliased Doppler frequency that will appear in the spectral trace. Use the sign of your reported frequency to indicate the apparent flow direction relative to the baseline convention described above. Express your final answer as a single signed value in hertz (Hz). No rounding is required; report an exact integer value if applicable.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in understanding the consequences of sampling a continuous-time signal. According to the principles of signal processing, when a signal with a frequency component $f$ is sampled at a rate $f_s$, its frequency content in the discrete-time domain is periodic with period $f_s$. The principal alias, which is what is typically displayed, is the frequency component that falls within the baseband interval, defined as $[-f_s/2, f_s/2]$. This interval is bounded by the Nyquist frequency, $f_{Nyquist} = f_s/2$.\n\nThe aliased frequency, $f_{alias}$, is related to the true frequency, $f$, by the equation:\n$$f_{alias} = f - k \\cdot f_s$$\nwhere $k$ is an integer chosen such that $f_{alias}$ is within the principal range:\n$$- \\frac{f_s}{2} \\leq f_{alias} \\leq \\frac{f_s}{2}$$\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\nThe true Doppler frequency, $f = f_D = 3.2\\ \\text{kHz} = 3200\\ \\text{Hz}$.\nThe sampling frequency, $f_s = \\text{PRF} = 5\\ \\text{kHz} = 5000\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Nyquist frequency and the corresponding baseband interval.\n$$f_{Nyquist} = \\frac{f_s}{2} = \\frac{5000\\ \\text{Hz}}{2} = 2500\\ \\text{Hz}$$\nThe baseband interval is therefore $[-2500\\ \\text{Hz}, 2500\\ \\text{Hz}]$.\n\nThe true frequency $f_D = 3200\\ \\text{Hz}$ lies outside this interval, as $|f_D| > f_{Nyquist}$. This confirms that aliasing will occur.\n\nWe must find an integer $k$ such that the value of $f_{alias} = 3200 - k \\cdot 5000$ falls within the range $[-2500, 2500]$.\nLet's test integer values for $k$:\n- If $k=0$, then $f_{alias} = 3200 - 0 \\cdot 5000 = 3200\\ \\text{Hz}$. This is outside the interval.\n- If $k=1$, then $f_{alias} = 3200 - 1 \\cdot 5000 = -1800\\ \\text{Hz}$. This value lies within the interval $[-2500\\ \\text{Hz}, 2500\\ \\text{Hz}]$.\n- If $k=-1$, then $f_{alias} = 3200 - (-1) \\cdot 5000 = 8200\\ \\text{Hz}$. This is outside the interval.\n\nThe integer $k=1$ is the unique choice that maps the true frequency into the principal alias range.\nTherefore, the aliased Doppler frequency is $f_{alias} = -1800\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n\nThe sign of the result is negative. According to the convention provided, a positive frequency corresponds to flow toward the transducer, and a negative frequency corresponds to flow away. The true flow is toward the transducer ($f_D > 0$). Due to aliasing, the measured frequency is negative, which would be incorrectly interpreted as flow away from the transducer. This phenomenon is known as \"aliasing wrap-around\" in Doppler spectral displays.\n\nThe final answer is the calculated aliased frequency, including its sign.",

            "solution": "The solution is divided into two parts: first, determining the maximum Pulse Repetition Frequency ($PRF$) for unambiguous range, and second, assessing if this $PRF$ is sufficient to measure the given blood velocity without aliasing.\n\nPart 1: Unambiguous Range and Maximum PRF\n\nFor an ultrasound system to unambiguously determine the location of an echo, the system must wait for the echo from the maximum desired depth to return before transmitting the next pulse. The time interval between successive transmitted pulses is the Pulse Repetition Interval, denoted as $T_{PRI}$. The time required for an ultrasound pulse to travel to an axial depth $d$ and return is the two-way time-of-flight, $T_{flight}$. This is given by:\n$$\nT_{flight} = \\frac{2d}{c}\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the speed of sound in the medium.\n\nThe condition for unambiguous range is that the $T_{PRI}$ must be greater than or equal to the time-of-flight from the maximum depth of interest.\n$$\nT_{PRI} \\ge T_{flight} = \\frac{2d}{c}\n$$\nThe Pulse Repetition Frequency ($PRF$) is the reciprocal of the $T_{PRI}$:\n$$\nPRF = \\frac{1}{T_{PRI}}\n$$\nTo find the highest possible $PRF$ that still guarantees unambiguous ranging, we must use the smallest possible $T_{PRI}$, which corresponds to the equality in the condition above. Let this maximum $PRF$ be denoted as $PRF_{max}$.\n$$\nT_{PRI, min} = \\frac{2d}{c}\n$$\n$$\nPRF_{max} = \\frac{1}{T_{PRI, min}} = \\frac{c}{2d}\n$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$d = 12\\ \\text{cm} = 0.12\\ \\text{m}$\n$c = 1540\\ \\text{m/s}$\n\nWe calculate $PRF_{max}$:\n$$\nPRF_{max} = \\frac{1540\\ \\text{m/s}}{2 \\times 0.12\\ \\text{m}} = \\frac{1540}{0.24}\\ \\text{Hz} \\approx 6416.67\\ \\text{Hz}\n$$\nExpressed in kilohertz, this is approximately $6.41667\\ \\text{kHz}$.\n\nPart 2: Doppler Aliasing Assessment\n\nThe Doppler effect causes a shift in the frequency of the backscattered ultrasound wave due to the motion of the scatterers (blood cells). The Doppler shift frequency, $f_D$, is given by the Doppler equation:\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{2 v f_0 \\cos\\theta}{c}\n$$\nwhere $v$ is the velocity of the scatterers, $f_0$ is the transmitted center frequency, and $\\theta$ is the insonation angle (the angle between the ultrasound beam direction and the velocity vector of the blood flow).\n\nIn pulsed-wave Doppler, the Doppler signal is sampled at a rate equal to the $PRF$. According to the Nyquist sampling theorem, to avoid aliasing, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the absolute value of the highest frequency component in the signal. In this context, the condition to avoid aliasing is:\n$$\nPRF \\ge 2|f_D|\n$$\nThe frequency $2|f_D|$ is often referred to as the Nyquist rate, and half the PRF, $PRF/2$, is called the Nyquist limit.\n\nLet us calculate the Doppler shift for the given parameters:\n$v = 2\\ \\text{m/s}$\n$f_0 = 6\\ \\text{MHz} = 6 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Hz}$\n$\\theta = 45^\\circ$, so $\\cos(45^\\circ) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$\n$c = 1540\\ \\text{m/s}$\n\n$$\nf_D = \\frac{2 \\times (2\\ \\text{m/s}) \\times (6 \\times 10^6\\ \\text{Hz}) \\times \\cos(45^\\circ)}{1540\\ \\text{m/s}} = \\frac{24 \\times 10^6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{1540}\\ \\text{Hz} \\approx 11019.5\\ \\text{Hz}\n$$\nThe required minimum $PRF$ to avoid aliasing would be:\n$$\nPRF_{min, Doppler} = 2 |f_D| \\approx 2 \\times 11019.5\\ \\text{Hz} = 22039\\ \\text{Hz}\n$$\nThis required $PRF$ is approximately $22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$.\n\nConclusion: Joint Satisfiability\n\nThe maximum $PRF$ that allows for unambiguous range determination at a depth of $12\\ \\text{cm}$ is $PRF_{max} \\approx 6.417\\ \\text{kHz}$.\nThe minimum $PRF$ required to measure the specified velocity without aliasing is $PRF_{min, Doppler} \\approx 22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$.\n\nSince $PRF_{max} < PRF_{min, Doppler}$ ($6.417\\ \\text{kHz} < 22.04\\ \\text{kHz}$), it is not possible to simultaneously satisfy both conditions. The maximum PRF permitted by the depth constraint is insufficient to sample the high Doppler shift frequency without aliasing. This scenario exemplifies the fundamental range-velocity ambiguity in pulsed Doppler ultrasound: increasing the depth of interrogation (which decreases the maximum allowable $PRF$) reduces the maximum velocity that can be measured without aliasing.\n\nThe final answer requested is the largest PRF consistent with unambiguous range, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nPRF_{max} \\approx 6416.67\\ \\text{Hz} = 6.41667\\ \\text{kHz}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $6.417\\ \\text{kHz}$.",
