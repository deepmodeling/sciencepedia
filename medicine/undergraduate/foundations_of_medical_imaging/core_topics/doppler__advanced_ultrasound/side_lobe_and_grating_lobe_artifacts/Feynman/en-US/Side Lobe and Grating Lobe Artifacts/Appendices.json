The aperture has a width $D$ and is subject to uniform illumination. The far-field pressure amplitude pattern is proportional to the spatial Fourier transform of this aperture function.\n\nLet the spatial coordinate along the aperture be $x$.

We must find the angle $\\theta_{h}$ for which $I(\\theta_h) = 0.5$.\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\sin(u_h)}{u_h} \\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{\\sin(u_h)}{u_h} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $u_h$. Solving it numerically yields:\n$$\nu_h \\approx 1.39155\n$$\nThis value of $u_h$ corresponds to the half-width angle $\\theta_h$. We can find $\\theta_h$ from the definition of $u$:\n$$\nu_h = \\frac{\\pi D \\sin(\\theta_h)}{\\lambda} \\implies \\sin(\\theta_h) = \\frac{u_h \\lambda}{\\pi D}\n$$\nThe full $-3 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ beamwidth, $\\mathrm{BW}_{3dB}$, is $2\\theta_h$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of wave physics and array signal processing, well-posed with sufficient information, and objective in its formulation.\n\nWe begin by establishing the fundamental principles governing beam formation by a phased linear array transducer. For a one-dimensional linear array with a uniform inter-element spacing of $d$, the direction of the main beam and any grating lobes is determined by the condition for constructive interference. When the beam is steered to an angle $\\theta_s$ relative to the array normal, the angular locations $\\theta$ of constructive interference maxima are given by the array equation:\n$$d (\\sin\\theta - \\sin\\theta_s) = m\\lambda$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the ultrasound wave, and $m$ is an integer ($m = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots$) representing the order of the interference maximum.\n\nThe main lobe, which is the intended steered beam, corresponds to the case where $m=0$, which yields $\\sin\\theta = \\sin\\theta_s$, and thus $\\theta = \\theta_s$.\nGrating lobes are spurious, secondary maxima corresponding to non-zero integer values of $m$. The angular position of the $m$-th order grating lobe, $\\theta_{g,m}$, can be found by rearranging the equation:\n$$\\sin\\theta_{g,m} = \\sin\\theta_s + m\\frac{\\lambda}{d}$$\nA grating lobe becomes a significant artifact if it appears in the \"visible\" or \"physical\" angular range, which corresponds to real propagating waves. This range is defined by $|\\theta_{g,m}| \\le 90^\\circ$, which is equivalent to the condition $|\\sin\\theta_{g,m}| \\le 1$. To prevent grating lobes, we must ensure that for all non-zero integers $m$, the calculated value of $\\sin\\theta_{g,m}$ falls outside this range. That is, we must enforce the condition:\n$$|\\sin\\theta_{g,m}| > 1 \\quad \\text{for all } m \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\ldots\\}$$\nIf this condition holds for the first-order grating lobes ($m = \\pm 1$), it will also hold for all higher-order lobes ($|m| > 1$), since they are located even farther from the main lobe in sine-space. Therefore, we only need to consider the $m=+1$ and $m=-1$ cases.\n\nThe two conditions are:\n1. For $m=+1$: $|\\sin\\theta_s + \\frac{\\lambda}{d}| > 1$\n2. For $m=-1$: $|\\sin\\theta_s - \\frac{\\lambda}{d}| > 1$\n\nThese conditions must be satisfied for all steering angles $\\theta_s$ within the specified range $|\\theta_s| \\le \\theta_{\\max}$. We must therefore consider the \"worst-case\" scenario, which occurs when the grating lobe is shifted closest to the visible region $[-1, 1]$.\n\nLet's analyze the first condition, involving $m=+1$. The term is $\\sin\\theta_s + \\frac{\\lambda}{d}$. To ensure this is greater than $1$, we must check the case where it has its smallest value. This occurs when $\\sin\\theta_s$ is most negative, i.e., at $\\theta_s = -\\theta_{\\max}$. The condition becomes:\n$$\\sin(-\\theta_{\\max}) + \\frac{\\lambda}{d} > 1$$\n$$-\\sin\\theta_{\\max} + \\frac{\\lambda}{d} > 1$$\n\nNow let's analyze the second condition, involving $m=-1$. The term is $\\sin\\theta_s - \\frac{\\lambda}{d}$. To ensure this is less than $-1$, we must check the case where it has its largest (least negative) value. This occurs when $\\sin\\theta_s$ is most positive, i.e., at $\\theta_s = +\\theta_{\\max}$. The condition becomes:\n$$\\sin\\theta_{\\max} - \\frac{\\lambda}{d} < -1$$\n\nBoth of these inequalities must be satisfied. Let's rearrange them:\nFrom the first: $\\frac{\\lambda}{d} > 1 + \\sin\\theta_{\\max}$\nFrom the second: $1 + \\sin\\theta_{\\max} < \\frac{\\lambda}{d}$\nBoth inequalities are identical. Thus, the single, comprehensive condition to prevent grating lobes from entering the visible field for all steering angles up to $\\pm\\theta_{\\max}$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{d} > 1 + \\sin\\theta_{\\max}$$\nThis can be expressed as a condition on the element pitch $d$:\n$$d < \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + \\sin\\theta_{\\max}}$$\nThis is the required derivation. The maximum allowable element pitch, $d_{\\max}$, is the value that makes this an equality, although in practice $d$ must be strictly less than this value.

            "solution": "This problem is analyzed based on the principles of linear systems theory applied to wave propagation in pulse-echo ultrasound. The total system response to a point scatterer, which defines the point spread function (PSF), is the cascade of the transmit and receive processes.\n\nLet the one-way angular sensitivity, or field beampattern, be denoted by $B_{1W}(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the angle relative to the main beam axis. This function describes the relative field amplitude transmitted to, or received from, a point at a given angle. The problem states that the transmit and receive apodizations are identical, which implies that the transmit beampattern, $B_{Tx}(\\theta)$, and the receive beampattern, $B_{Rx}(\\theta)$, are identical.\n$$B_{Tx}(\\theta) = B_{Rx}(\\theta) = B_{1W}(\\theta)$$\nThe principle of superposition for a linear system dictates that the overall two-way field beampattern, $B_{2W}(\\theta)$, is the product of the transmit and receive field beampatterns. This is because the transmitted wave's amplitude at the scatterer is proportional to $B_{Tx}(\\theta)$, and the sensitivity to the scattered wave returning from that direction is proportional to $B_{Rx}(\\theta)$.\n$$B_{2W}(\\theta) = B_{Tx}(\\theta) \\cdot B_{Rx}(\\theta)$$\nSubstituting the equality of the one-way patterns, we have:\n$$B_{2W}(\\theta) = B_{1W}(\\theta) \\cdot B_{1W}(\\theta) = [B_{1W}(\\theta)]^2$$\nThis equation shows that the two-way field pattern is the squared version of the one-way field pattern.\n\nNext, we relate the field pattern to the intensity pattern. The acoustic intensity, $I$, is proportional to the square of the acoustic field amplitude, $B$. The one-way intensity pattern, $I_{1W}(\\theta)$, is therefore proportional to $[B_{1W}(\\theta)]^2$. The two-way intensity pattern, $I_{2W}(\\theta)$, which corresponds to the lateral profile of the PSF for a point scatterer, is proportional to $[B_{2W}(\\theta)]^2$.\n$$I_{2W}(\\theta) \\propto [B_{2W}(\\theta)]^2 = \\left([B_{1W}(\\theta)]^2\\right)^2 = [B_{1W}(\\theta)]^4$$\nSince $I_{1W}(\\theta) \\propto [B_{1W}(\\theta)]^2$, it follows that $[B_{1W}(\\theta)]^4 \\propto [I_{1W}(\\theta)]^2$. We can therefore establish a direct relationship between the one-way and two-way intensity patterns:\n$$I_{2W}(\\theta) \\propto [I_{1W}(\\theta)]^2$$\nThis is the fundamental relationship: the two-way intensity pattern is the square of the one-way intensity pattern.\n\nThe side lobe level (SLL) in decibels (dB) is defined for power or intensity quantities as:\n$$SLL_{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{SL}}{I_{ML}}\\right)$$\nwhere $I_{SL}$ is the peak intensity of the side lobe and $I_{ML}$ is the peak intensity of the main lobe.\n\nThe problem provides the one-way side lobe level, $SLL_{1W, dB} = -25 \\text{ dB}$. We need to find the two-way side lobe level, $SLL_{2W, dB}$.\nUsing our derived relationship, the ratio of the two-way side lobe to the two-way main lobe intensity is:\n$$\\frac{I_{2W, SL}}{I_{2W, ML}} = \\frac{[I_{1W, SL}]^2}{[I_{1W, ML}]^2} = \\left(\\frac{I_{1W, SL}}{I_{1W, ML}}\\right)^2$$\nNow, substitute this into the decibel formula for $SLL_{2W, dB}$:\n$$SLL_{2W, dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\left[\\left(\\frac{I_{1W, SL}}{I_{1W, ML}}\\right)^2\\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\log(x^p) = p \\log(x)$:\n$$SLL_{2W, dB} = 2 \\cdot \\left[10 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I_{1W, SL}}{I_{1W, ML}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe expression in the brackets is the definition of $SLL_{1W, dB}$.
