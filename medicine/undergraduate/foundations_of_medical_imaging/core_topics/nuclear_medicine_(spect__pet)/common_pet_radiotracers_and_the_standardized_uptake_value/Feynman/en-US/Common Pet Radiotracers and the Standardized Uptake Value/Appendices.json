The assumption regarding tissue density is explicitly stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe Standardized Uptake Value normalized by body weight, $SUV_{bw}$, is defined as the ratio of the decay-corrected activity concentration in a region of interest (tissue) to the total decay-corrected administered activity distributed over the entire body mass. This is expressed as:\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{C_{\\text{tissue}}(t)}{\\frac{A_{\\text{administered, decay-corrected}}(t)}{W}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{tissue}}(t)$ is the activity concentration in the tissue at scan time $t$, $A_{\\text{administered, decay-corrected}}(t)$ is the total administered activity corrected for radioactive decay to time $t$, and $W$ is the patient's body weight.\n\nFirst, we determine the net activity that was actually administered to the patient at time $t=0$. This is the prepared injection activity, $A_{inj}$, minus the residual activity left in the syringe, $A_{res}$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,0}} = A_{inj} - A_{res}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,0}} = 300 \\text{ MBq} - 2 \\text{ MBq} = 298 \\text{ MBq}\n$$\n\nNext, we must account for the radioactive decay of $^{18}\\mathrm{F}$ between the time of injection ($t=0$) and the time of the scan ($t=60$ min). The activity at time $t$, denoted $A(t)$, is given by the radioactive decay law:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the initial activity and $\\lambda$ is the decay constant. The decay constant is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$.\nThe net administered activity, decay-corrected to the scan time $t$, is therefore:\n$$\nA_{\\text{net,t}} = A_{\\text{net,0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\n\nThe denominator of the $SUV_{bw}$ formula is the \"concentration\" of the decay-corrected activity if it were uniformly distributed throughout the patient's body mass $W$.\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = \\frac{A_{\\text{net,t}}}{W} = \\frac{A_{\\text{net,0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)}{W}\n$$\n\nThe numerator is the measured activity concentration in the lesion at the scan time, $C_t$. The problem asks for a dimensionless $SUV_{bw}$. To achieve this, the units of the numerator and denominator must be consistent. The standard convention is to express both in units of activity per unit mass (e.g., Bq/g).\n\nThe given tissue concentration is $C_t = 8$ kBq/ml. Using the provided assumption that soft tissue density $\\rho \\approx 1$ g/ml, we can convert the volume-based concentration to a mass-based concentration:\n$$\nC_t = 8 \\frac{\\text{kBq}}{\\text{ml}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ ml}}{1 \\text{ g}} = 8 \\frac{\\text{kBq}}{\\text{g}}\n$$\n\nNow we formulate the full expression for $SUV_{bw}$ and ensure consistent units for the denominator.\nWe have:\n- $C_t = 8$ kBq/g\n- $A_{\\text{net,0}} = 298 \\text{ MBq} = 298 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kBq}$\n- $W = 75 \\text{ kg} = 75 \\times 10^3 \\text{ g}$\n- $t_{1/2} = 110$ min\n- $t = 60$ min\n\nThe $SUV_{bw}$ expression is:\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{C_t}{\\frac{A_{\\text{net,t}}}{W}} = \\frac{C_t \\cdot W}{A_{\\text{net,t}}} = \\frac{C_t \\cdot W}{A_{\\text{net,0}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot t}{t_{1/2}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the numerical values with consistent units (kBq for activity, g for mass):\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{\\left(8 \\frac{\\text{kBq}}{\\text{g}}\\right) \\cdot (75 \\times 10^3 \\text{ g})}{(298 \\times 10^3 \\text{ kBq}) \\cdot \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot 60 \\text{ min}}{110 \\text{ min}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe factors of $10^3$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, as do the units, leaving a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{8 \\cdot 75}{298} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{6}{11} \\ln(2)\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{600}{298} \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{6}{11} \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction $\\frac{600}{298} = \\frac{300}{149}$.\n$$\nSUV_{bw} = \\frac{300}{149} \\exp\\left(\\frac{6}{11} \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\nThe pre-factor is $\\frac{300}{149} \\approx 2.01342$.\nThe exponential term is $\\exp\\left(\\frac{6}{11} \\ln(2)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{6/11}\\right)\\right) = 2^{6/11}$.\n$2^{6/11} \\approx 2^{0.545454...} \\approx 1.45952$.\nTherefore:\n$$\nSUV_{bw} \\approx 2.01342 \\times 1.45952 \\approx 2.93874\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nSUV_{bw} \\approx 2.94\n$$\nThe standardized uptake value for the lesion is approximately $2.94$.",

The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains a complete and consistent setup.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem requires two outputs: a derivation of the blood-volume correction for the tissue SUV, and its numerical computation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Blood-Volume Correction Formula**\n\nThe Standardized Uptake Value, $\\mathrm{SUV}$, is defined as the decay-corrected tissue concentration of a radiotracer, $C(t)$, normalized by the injected activity, $A_{\\mathrm{inj}}$, distributed over the patient's body mass, $M$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}(t) = \\frac{C(t)}{A_{\\mathrm{inj}}/M}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the units for this calculation: $C(t)$ is in $\\mathrm{kBq/mL}$, $A_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ is in $\\mathrm{kBq}$, and $M$ is in $\\mathrm{g}$. The assumption that soft tissue density is $1 \\ \\mathrm{g/mL}$ allows for the cancellation of units, rendering the SUV dimensionless.\n\nWe can apply this definition to the concentrations in the total ROI ($C_t$), the pure tissue compartment ($C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$), and the plasma ($C_p$). Let the normalization factor be $D = A_{\\mathrm{inj}}/M$.\n- The SUV of the entire ROI is $\\mathrm{SUV}_t = \\frac{C_t}{D}$.\n- The SUV of the pure tissue is $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}}{D}$.\n- The SUV of the plasma is $\\mathrm{SUV}_p = \\frac{C_p}{D}$.\n\nThe problem provides a mixture model for the measured activity concentration in the ROI, which accounts for the partial volume effect from the intravascular blood volume fraction, $v_b$:\n$$\nC_t = (1 - v_b) C_{\\mathrm{tissue}} + v_b C_p\n$$\nTo derive a relationship between the corresponding SUVs, we divide the entire equation by the normalization factor $D = A_{\\mathrm{inj}}/M$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_t}{D} = \\frac{(1 - v_b) C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}}{D} + \\frac{v_b C_p}{D}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{C_t}{D} = (1 - v_b) \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}}{D} + v_b \\frac{C_p}{D}\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of the various SUVs, we obtain a linear relationship between them:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_t = (1 - v_b) \\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} + v_b \\mathrm{SUV}_p\n$$\nThe goal is to find the corrected tissue SUV, $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$. We can rearrange the above equation to solve for $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$:\n$$\n(1 - v_b) \\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\mathrm{SUV}_t - v_b \\mathrm{SUV}_p\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SUV}_t - v_b \\mathrm{SUV}_p}{1 - v_b}\n$$\nThis is the derived formula for the blood-volume correction. It allows the estimation of the true tissue SUV from the measured ROI SUV ($\\mathrm{SUV}_t$), the plasma SUV ($\\mathrm{SUV}_p$), and the blood volume fraction ($v_b$).\n\n**2. Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the value of $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$ at $t=60$ minutes using the given data. An efficient method is to first compute the corrected tissue concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$, and then normalize it to obtain $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$.\n\nFirst, we solve the mixture model for $C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{C_t - v_b C_p}{1 - v_b}\n$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n- $C_t = 6.0 \\ \\mathrm{kBq/mL}$\n- $C_p = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{kBq/mL}$\n- $v_b = 0.05$\n\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{6.0 - (0.05)(1.2)}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{6.0 - 0.06}{0.95} = \\frac{5.94}{0.95} \\ \\mathrm{kBq/mL}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the normalization factor, $D = A_{\\mathrm{inj}}/M$. We must ensure the units are consistent with the problem definition ($A_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ in $\\mathrm{kBq}$, $M$ in $\\mathrm{g}$).\n- $A_{\\mathrm{inj}} = 370 \\ \\mathrm{MBq} = 370 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}$\n- $M = 70 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 70 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{g}$\n\n$$\nD = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{inj}}}{M} = \\frac{370 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{kBq}}{70 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{370}{70} \\ \\mathrm{kBq/g} = \\frac{37}{7} \\ \\mathrm{kBq/g}\n$$\nNow we compute the final $\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{tissue}}}{D} = \\frac{\\frac{5.94}{0.95} \\ \\mathrm{kBq/mL}}{\\frac{37}{7} \\ \\mathrm{kBq/g}}\n$$\nUsing the assumption that $1 \\ \\mathrm{mL} \\approx 1 \\ \\mathrm{g}$, the units cancel, and the value is dimensionless.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} = \\frac{5.94 / 0.95}{37 / 7} = \\frac{5.94 \\times 7}{0.95 \\times 37} = \\frac{41.58}{35.15}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} \\approx 1.18292176...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathrm{SUV}_{\\mathrm{tissue}} \\approx 1.183\n$$\nThis value represents the estimated SUV of the pure skeletal muscle tissue after correcting for the contribution of activity from the blood pool within the ROI. As expected, the corrected tissue SUV ($1.183$) is slightly higher than the uncorrected ROI SUV ($\\mathrm{SUV}_t = \\frac{6.0}{37/7} \\approx 1.135$), because the correction removes the contribution of the less active blood pool ($C_p < C_t$).",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe Standardized Uptake Value on a body-weight basis, $SUV_{\\mathrm{bw}}$, is a semi-quantitative metric that normalizes the measured tissue activity concentration to the average activity concentration distributed throughout the patient's body. It is defined as a unitless ratio:\n$$\nSUV_{\\mathrm{bw}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}}{A_{\\text{inj}} / M}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}$ is the activity concentration in the tissue of interest (the lesion), decay-corrected to the time of injection ($t=0$), $A_{\\text{inj}}$ is the total injected activity, and $M$ is the patient's body mass.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the decay-corrected activity concentration, $C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}$. The radioactive decay law states that the activity $A(t)$ at time $t$ is related to the initial activity $A_0$ by:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the decay constant. The decay constant is related to the half-life $T_{1/2}$ by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}}\n$$\nIn our case, the measured concentration at time $t=72\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is $C_{\\text{lesion,measured}}(t)$. The decay-corrected concentration, $C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}$, corresponds to the hypothetical concentration at $t=0$. We can find it by rearranging the decay formula:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lesion, corrected}} = C_{\\text{lesion,measured}}(t) \\exp(\\lambda t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$ and the given values:\n- $C_{\\text{lesion,measured}}(t) = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kBq/mL}$\n- $t = 72\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- $T_{1/2} = 78.41\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\n$$\nC_{\\text{lesion, corrected}} = (5.0\\,\\mathrm{kBq/mL}) \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{78.41\\,\\mathrm{h}} \\times 72\\,\\mathrm{h}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe denominator of the $SUV_{\\mathrm{bw}}$ formula is the injected dose normalized by body mass, which represents the average activity concentration if the tracer were uniformly distributed. To ensure the $SUV_{\\mathrm{bw}}$ is unitless, a consistent set of units must be used for the numerator and denominator. The standard convention in $SUV$ calculations implicitly assumes a tissue density of $1.0\\,\\mathrm{g/mL}$, which is explicitly provided in this problem. This allows for the equivalency of units: $1\\,\\mathrm{kBq/mL} = 1\\,\\mathrm{kBq/g}$. We will work in units of $\\mathrm{kBq}$ and $\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nThe numerator, $C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}$, becomes:\n$$\nC_{\\text{lesion, corrected}} = (5.0\\,\\mathrm{kBq/g}) \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{72}{78.41} \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\n\nThe denominator, the average body concentration, is:\n- $A_{\\text{inj}} = 185\\,\\mathrm{MBq} = 185 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kBq}$\n- $M = 75\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 75 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrmg$\n\n$$\n\\frac{A_{\\text{inj}}}{M} = \\frac{185 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{kBq}}{75 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrmg} = \\frac{185}{75}\\,\\mathrm{kBq/g}\n$$\n\nNow we assemble the full expression for $SUV_{\\mathrm{bw}}$:\n$$\nSUV_{\\mathrm{bw}} = \\frac{(5.0) \\times \\exp\\left(\\frac{72}{78.41} \\ln(2)\\right)}{\\frac{185}{75}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite $\\exp(x \\ln(2))$ as $2^x$:\n$$\nSUV_{\\mathrm{bw}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 2^{(72/78.41)}}{185/75} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 75}{185} \\times 2^{(72/78.41)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\frac{72}{78.41} \\approx 0.9182502\n$$\n$$\n2^{0.9182502} \\approx 1.890633\n$$\n$$\nSUV_{\\mathrm{bw}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 75}{185} \\times 1.890633 \\approx \\frac{375}{185} \\times 1.890633 \\approx 2.027027 \\times 1.890633 \\approx 3.8327\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $3.83$.\n\n### Explanation of Biological Processes\n\nThe calculation of $SUV_{\\mathrm{bw}}$ applies a correction only for the physical decay of the radionuclide. However, the value of the measured lesion concentration at $t=72\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $C_{\\text{lesion,measured}}(t=72\\,\\mathrm{h})$, is profoundly shaped by a series of complex, time-dependent biological processes that occur between the injection at $t=0$ and the measurement time.\n\nThe key processes are:\n1.  **Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution**: After injection, the $^{89}\\mathrm{Zr}$-labeled antibody circulates in the bloodstream. Its concentration in the blood decreases over time due to uptake by various organs and, crucially, clearance from the body, primarily by the liver and spleen (the reticuloendothelial system). This systemic clearance is a biological process.\n2.  **Tumor Targeting and Uptake**: For the antibody to accumulate in the lesion, it must be transported by blood flow to the tumor, pass from blood vessels into the tumor tissue (extravasation), and bind specifically to its target antigen on cancer cells. This uptake is a biological phenomenon that competes with the systemic clearance.\n3.  **Retention and Biological Clearance from Lesion**: Once bound in the tumor, the antibody is not permanently trapped. It can be internalized by the cell and catabolized, or the antigen-antibody complex can be shed from the cell surface. This constitutes a biological clearance process directly from the lesion, which has its own biological half-life.\n\nThe concentration measured at $72\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $C_{\\text{lesion,measured}} = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{kBq/mL}$, is the net result of this multi-day interplay between delivery, uptake, retention, and clearance (both systemic and local), all superimposed on the continuous physical decay of $^{89}\\mathrm{Zr}$. A high measured concentration at a late time point like $72\\,\\mathrm{h}$ is indicative of successful targeting: the rate of biological uptake and retention in the tumor has significantly outpaced the rates of biological clearance from the tumor and the body.\n\nThe $SUV$ calculation intentionally isolates and reverses *only* the physical decay component. The resulting decay-corrected value, $C_{\\text{lesion, corrected}}$, does not represent a real physical concentration at $t=0$. Instead, it is a standardized metric that reflects the *net biological outcome* at the time of the scan. By removing the time-of-scan dependence due to physical decay, the $SUV$ provides a more comparable measure of the tracer's biological avidity in the tissue, which is the very thing of clinical and research interest. Therefore, even though biological clearance is not explicitly in the $SUV$ formula, its effects are implicitly present and are, in fact, the dominant determinant of the magnitude of the concentration value that serves as the input to the formula.",
