While 'true' coincidences provide useful anatomical and physiological information, 'random' coincidences are a fundamental source of noise that arises from unrelated gamma rays happening to strike opposing detectors within the system's timing window. This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to derive the classic formula for the random coincidence rate from first principles and to calculate its significance in a realistic brain imaging scenario, giving you a tangible understanding of how this noise corrupts the raw data.

            "problem": "A positron emission tomography (PET) study of Parkinson's Disease (PD) monitoring employs a brain protocol using a dopamine transporter radiotracer. Consider a single line of response (LOR) traversing the striatal region of interest (ROI) for which two opposing detector blocks register independent singles streams modeled as stationary Poisson processes with constant rates $S_1$ and $S_2$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). The electronics define a symmetric coincidence time window of half-width $\\tau$ (so coincidences are accepted when the arrival times differ by at most $\\tau$ seconds). The measured true coincidence rate for this LOR is $T$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$), and the scatter coincidence rate is $S$ (in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$). Random coincidences arise when unrelated singles from the two detectors fall within the time window.\n\nStarting from the Poisson process framework and the definition of the coincidence window, derive the leading-order expression for the random coincidence rate for this LOR in terms of $S_1$, $S_2$, and $\\tau$ under the small-window approximation. Then, using the following experimentally observed values:\n- $S_1 = 3.2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $S_2 = 2.8 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $\\tau = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$,\n- $T = 6.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n- $S = 3.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$,\n\ncompute the random-to-true-plus-scatter ratio $r$ defined by $r = R/(T+S)$, where $R$ is the random coincidence rate you have derived. Express $r$ as a dimensionless decimal and round your final result to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, establishing a standard scenario in positron emission tomography (PET) physics. The modeling of detector singles events as independent stationary Poisson processes is a cornerstone of PET data analysis, and the provided numerical values for event rates and timing parameters are physically realistic for a modern clinical scanner. We can therefore proceed with the derivation and subsequent calculation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the random coincidence rate, $R$. A random coincidence occurs when two unrelated single detection events, one in each of the opposing detectors, are registered within the specified coincidence time window.\n\nLet the two independent streams of single events be modeled as stationary Poisson processes with constant rates $S_1$ and $S_2$, respectively. Consider a single event registered by detector 1 at a time $t_1$. For a random coincidence to be recorded for this specific event, an unrelated event must be registered by detector 2 at a time $t_2$ such that the absolute difference in their arrival times is less than or equal to the half-width of the coincidence window, $\\tau$. This condition is expressed as $|t_1 - t_2| \\le \\tau$, which is equivalent to $t_1 - \\tau \\le t_2 \\le t_1 + \\tau$.\n\nThe time interval during which an event from detector 2 can form a random coincidence with the event at $t_1$ is $[t_1 - \\tau, t_1 + \\tau]$. The total duration of this interval is $(t_1 + \\tau) - (t_1 - \\tau) = 2\\tau$.\n\nSince the events at detector 2 form a Poisson process with rate $S_2$, the probability of observing $k$ events in any time interval of duration $\\Delta t$ is given by the Poisson probability mass function:\n$$P(k \\text{ events in } \\Delta t) = \\frac{(\\lambda \\Delta t)^k e^{-\\lambda \\Delta t}}{k!}$$\nwhere the rate is $\\lambda = S_2$.\n\nFor our case, $\\Delta t = 2\\tau$. The probability of at least one event from detector 2 occurring in this window is $P(k \\ge 1)$. It is simpler to calculate the complement, the probability of zero events, $P(k=0)$.\n$$P(k=0 \\text{ in } 2\\tau) = \\frac{(S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau)^0 e^{-S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau}}{0!} = e^{-S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau}$$\nTherefore, the probability of at least one event is:\n$$P(k \\ge 1 \\text{ in } 2\\tau) = 1 - P(k=0) = 1 - e^{-S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau}$$\nThis is the probability that a given single event from detector 1 will be part of a random coincidence.\n\nThe problem specifies the \"small-window approximation\". This implies that the product of the singles rate and the full time window is much less than $1$, i.e., $S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau \\ll 1$. Under this condition, we can use the first-order Taylor series expansion for the exponential function, $e^{-x} \\approx 1 - x$ for small $x$.\nApplying this approximation with $x = S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau$:\n$$P(k \\ge 1) \\approx 1 - (1 - S_2 \\cdot 2\\tau) = 2\\tau S_2$$\nThe rate of random coincidences, $R$, is the rate at which singles arrive at detector 1 ($S_1$) multiplied by the probability that each such single forms a random coincidence with an event from detector 2.\n$$R = (\\text{Rate of singles at detector 1}) \\times (\\text{Probability of a random coincidence per single})$$\n$$R = S_1 \\times P(k \\ge 1) \\approx S_1 (2\\tau S_2)$$\nThus, the leading-order expression for the random coincidence rate is:\n$$R = 2\\tau S_1 S_2$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $R$ using the provided experimental values:\n- $S_1 = 3.2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $S_2 = 2.8 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nSubstituting these into the derived expression for $R$:\n$$R = 2 \\times (4.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\times (3.2 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (2.8 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})$$\n$$R = 2 \\times 4.0 \\times 3.2 \\times 2.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 10^{5} \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$R = 71.68 \\times 10^{(-9+5+5)}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$R = 71.68 \\times 10^{1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 716.8\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to compute the random-to-true-plus-scatter ratio, $r$, defined as $r = R/(T+S)$. We use the calculated value of $R$ and the given values for the true coincidence rate, $T$, and the scatter coincidence rate, $S$:\n- $T = 6.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 650\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $S = 3.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 350\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator, which is the sum of the true and scatter coincidence rates:\n$$T + S = 650\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 350\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 1.00 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, we can compute the ratio $r$:\n$$r = \\frac{R}{T+S} = \\frac{716.8\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}$$\n$$r = 0.7168$$\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as a dimensionless decimal rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $7$, $1$, and $6$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third digit.\n$$r \\approx 0.717$$\nThis completes the required calculations.",

In the main coincidence timing window, the total prompt counts recorded in that bin are $P=4.8\\times 10^{4}$. In a delayed coincidence timing window, which samples only the accidental (random) coincidences from the same underlying process but with a time shift, the recorded counts are $D=1.5\\times 10^{4}$. Due to a known small mismatch of timing electronics between the main and delayed windows, the delayed-window counts must be scaled by a calibration factor $\\alpha=0.95$ to yield an unbiased estimate of the randoms contribution in the main window.\n\nAssume the following foundational model:\n- The prompt counts arise from the superposition of three independent Poisson processes: true coincidences $T$, scattered coincidences $S$, and random coincidences $R$, so the prompt process is $T+S+R$.\n- The delayed-window counts $D$ are samples from the randoms process, independent of the main-window prompt process, and after scaling by $\\alpha$, $\\alpha D$ is an unbiased estimator of the randoms contribution in the main window.\n- For a Poisson process with mean $\\mu$, the variance equals the mean, i.e., $\\operatorname{Var}=\\mu$.\n\nUsing only these principles:\n1) Define the randoms fraction for this bin as the ratio of the expected random coincidences to the expected total prompt coincidences.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, self-contained, and scientifically grounded in the principles of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data analysis. The assumptions, data, and questions are consistent with standard practices in the field.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities based on the provided data and statistical model. Let the prompt counts be the random variable $P_{rv}$ and the delayed counts be the random variable $D_{rv}$. The given measurements are single realizations of these random variables: $P = 4.8 \\times 10^{4}$ and $D = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$. The calibration factor is $\\alpha=0.95$.\n\nAccording to the model:\n-   $P_{rv}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_P = E[P_{rv}] = T+S+R$, where $T$, $S$, and $R$ are the expected counts for true, scattered, and random coincidences, respectively. Thus, $P_{rv} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\mu_P)$. The variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(P_{rv}) = \\mu_P$.\n-   $D_{rv}$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu_D = E[D_{rv}]$.

The maximum likelihood and method of moments estimator for the mean of a Poisson distribution is the sample value itself. Therefore, a suitable point estimate for $\\mu_P$ is $\\hat{\\mu}_P = P$.\n-   The expected random count, $R$, is given by $R = \\alpha \\mu_D$. The mean of the delayed-count distribution, $\\mu_D$, can be estimated by the measurement $D$, so $\\hat{\\mu}_D = D$. This gives a point estimate for $R$ as $\\hat{R} = \\alpha D$.\n\nSubstituting these estimates into the definition of the randoms fraction gives the point estimate $\\widehat{RF}$:\n$$\\widehat{RF} = \\frac{\\hat{R}}{\\hat{\\mu}_P} = \\frac{\\alpha D}{P}$$\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n$$P = 4.8 \\times 10^{4}$$\n$$D = 1.5 \\times 10^{4}$$\n$$\\alpha = 0.95$$\nThe estimated randoms fraction is:\n$$\\widehat{RF} = \\frac{0.95 \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{4})}{4.8 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{1.425 \\times 10^{4}}{4.8 \\times 10^{4}} = \\frac{1.425}{4.8} = 0.296875$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.2969$.\n\n**2) Variance of the Randoms-Corrected Bin Value**\n\nThe randoms-corrected bin value, $C$, is defined as:\n$$C = P_{rv} - \\alpha D_{rv}$$\nWe are asked to derive the variance of this quantity, $\\operatorname{Var}(C)$.

Therefore, we will proceed with a full derivation.\n\n### Derivations\n\nFirst, we derive the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{C})$ of the estimator $\\hat{C} = P - \\beta D$.\n\nThe expectation of a Poisson random variable is equal to its mean parameter. Using the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}] = \\mathbb{E}[P - \\beta D] = \\mathbb{E}[P] - \\beta \\mathbb{E}[D]\n$$\nGiven $\\mathbb{E}[P] = \\mu_p = (T+S+R)\\tau$ and $\\mathbb{E}[D] = \\mu_d = R\\tau$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}] = (T+S+R)\\tau - \\beta (R\\tau) = (T+S)\\tau + (1-\\beta)R\\tau\n$$\n\nThe variance of a Poisson random variable is also equal to its mean parameter.

The true-plus-scatter counts over the interval $\\tau$ have an expected value of $(T+S)\\tau$. For $\\hat{C}$ to be an unbiased estimator of this quantity, its expectation must be equal to this value:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}] = (T+S)\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\mathbb{E}[\\hat{C}]$:\n$$\n(T+S)\\tau + (1-\\beta)R\\tau = (T+S)\\tau\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n(1-\\beta)R\\tau = 0\n$$\nAssuming non-trivial conditions where $R > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, we must have $1-\\beta = 0$, which yields $\\beta=1$.\n\nWe now use this unbiased choice, $\\beta=1$, for the subsequent parts of the problem.

The problem defines NECR as the rate $X$ of an idealized Poisson process (containing only true counts) that has the same squared signal-to-noise ratio ($(\\text{SNR})^2$) for detecting the true contribution as the corrected bin $\\hat{C}$.\n\nFor the idealized scenario, we have a count $N_X$ from a process with rate $X$, so $N_X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(X\\tau)$. The signal is the expected count, $\\mathbb{E}[N_X] = X\\tau$, and the variance is $\\mathrm{Var}(N_X) = X\\tau$.

The variance of the measurement is the variance of the estimator, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{C})$. Using the unbiased estimator, we found $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{C}) = (T+S+2R)\\tau$. The squared SNR for the corrected bin is:\n$$\n(\\text{SNR})_{\\hat{C}}^2 = \\frac{(\\text{Signal})^2}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{C})} = \\frac{(T\\tau)^2}{(T+S+2R)\\tau} = \\frac{T^2\\tau^2}{(T+S+2R)\\tau} = \\frac{T^2\\tau}{T+S+2R}\n$$\n\nAccording to the definition of NECR, we set $X = \\text{NECR}$ and equate the two squared SNRs:\n$$\n(\\text{SNR})_{\\text{ideal}}^2 = (\\text{SNR})_{\\hat{C}}^2\n$$\n$$\n(\\text{NECR})\\tau = \\frac{T^2\\tau}{T+S+2R}\n$$\nAssuming the measurement duration $\\tau > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\tau$ to solve for NECR:\n$$\n\\text{NECR} = \\frac{T^2}{T+S+2R}\n$$\nThis expression provides the noise-equivalent count rate in terms of the underlying true, scatter, and random coincidence rates, in the required units of counts per second.",
