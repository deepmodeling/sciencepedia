This resolution is not a single number; it is a composite of the detector's own intrinsic resolution and the geometric resolution of the collimator, which itself changes with distance from the source. This practice  guides you through deriving the total system resolution $R_{\\text{sys}}$ from these fundamental components, providing essential insight into how and why image quality degrades as the source moves farther from the detector.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical imaging, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language. It is free from scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradiction. We may therefore proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the system resolution, $R_{\\text{sys}}(z)$, of a gamma camera system and its numerical calculation at three specified distances from the collimator face. The total system resolution is determined by the combination of the collimator's geometric resolution, $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$, and the detector's intrinsic resolution, $R_{\\text{int}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the geometric resolution of the parallel-hole collimator, $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$. The problem states we should start from fundamental geometric considerations. The geometric resolution at a distance $z$ from the collimator face is defined as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the geometric component of the point spread function (PSF). By the principle of reciprocity, this is equivalent to the diameter of the region on the source plane (at distance $z$) from which photons can pass through a single collimator hole to reach a single point on the detector crystal.\n\nLet's consider a point on the detector crystal located on the central axis of a single collimator hole. This hole has a diameter $d$ and a length $L$. The detector point is at one end of the hole (the exit), and the entrance of the hole is at a distance $L$ from the detector. The source plane is at a distance $z$ from the hole entrance.\n\nWe can use similar triangles to determine the diameter of the field of view, which corresponds to $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$. One triangle is formed with its vertex at the detector point, its height being the collimator length $L$, and its base being the diameter of the hole entrance, $d$. A second, larger triangle shares the same vertex. Its height is the distance from the detector to the source plane, which is $L+z$. Its base is the diameter of the region on the source plane that can be \"seen\" by the detector point, which we define as $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$.\n\nBased on the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the base to the height is constant. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\text{col}}(z)}{L+z} = \\frac{d}{L}\n$$\nSolving for $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$, we obtain the expression for the collimator's geometric resolution:\n$$\nR_{\\text{col}}(z) = d \\frac{L+z}{L} = d \\left(1 + \\frac{z}{L}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the geometric resolution degrades linearly with increasing distance $z$ from the collimator face. At the face of the collimator, where $z=0$, the geometric resolution is simply the diameter of the hole, $R_{\\text{col}}(0) = d$.\n\nNext, we determine the total system resolution, $R_{\\text{sys}}(z)$. The problem states that the measured point spread function is dominated by geometric factors and intrinsic detector blur, and that these independent Gaussian-like blurs combine in quadrature for FWHM. The total system resolution is therefore the square root of the sum of the squares of the component resolutions:\n$$\nR_{\\text{sys}}(z) = \\sqrt{R_{\\text{col}}(z)^2 + R_{\\text{int}}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $R_{\\text{col}}(z)$:\n$$\nR_{\\text{sys}}(z) = \\sqrt{\\left(d \\frac{L+z}{L}\\right)^2 + R_{\\text{int}}^2}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the system resolution as a function of distance $z$.\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical values for the given parameters:\nIntrinsic resolution: $R_{\\text{int}} = 3.5 \\text{ mm}$\nCollimator hole diameter: $d = 1.5 \\text{ mm}$\nCollimator hole length: $L = 25 \\text{ mm}$\n\nThe distances must be in consistent units.

            "solution": "The problem will be addressed by first validating its premises and then proceeding through a logical sequence of steps: 1. Deriving the sampling adequacy condition from the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, 2. Calculating the pixel size for the given acquisition-system parameters, 3. Defining a dimensionless adequacy factor, and 4. Computing the value of this factor.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem statement is validated as follows:\n**Givens Extracted Verbatim:**\n- Gamma camera FOV dimension: $40\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- Acquisition matrix size: $256\\times 256$\n- System spatial resolution (FWHM): $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}=8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Task 1: Derive the condition connecting pixel size $p$ and system resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ for adequate sampling, starting from the Nyquist sampling theorem.\n- Task 2: Compute the pixel size $p$ in $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Task 3: Define a dimensionless adequacy factor $A$ that equals $1$ at the boundary of adequacy.\n- Task 4: Compute $A$ for the given parameters and round to three significant figures.\n- The final answer must be a unitless numerical value.\n\n**Validation Against Criteria:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of digital signal processing as applied to medical imaging, specifically nuclear medicine. The concepts of spatial resolution (FWHM), pixel size, and the Nyquist sampling theorem are standard in this field. The provided values are realistic for a clinical gamma camera. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated, with all necessary information provided to derive the condition and compute the required values. The tasks are sequential and logically connected, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The givens (FOV, matrix size, resolution) are sufficient and consistent. There are no contradictions.\n- **Feasibility:** The parameters describe a physically realistic imaging scenario.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Adequacy Condition\n\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that to reconstruct a bandlimited signal without loss of information (i.e., without aliasing), the sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice the maximum frequency component of the signal, $f_{\\text{max}}$. This is expressed as the Nyquist criterion:\n$$f_s \\ge 2 f_{\\text{max}}$$\nIn the context of spatial imaging, we consider spatial frequencies, typically denoted by $k$. The sampling interval is the pixel size, $p$. The spatial sampling frequency, $k_s$, is the reciprocal of the pixel size:\n$$k_s = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nThe Nyquist criterion in the spatial domain is therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{p} \\ge 2 k_{\\text{max}}$$\nThis can be rearranged to define the maximum allowable pixel size for alias-free sampling:\n$$p \\le \\frac{1}{2 k_{\\text{max}}}$$\nThe next step is to relate the maximum spatial frequency of the signal, $k_{\\text{max}}$, to the system's spatial resolution, $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. The system resolution, given as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF), blurs the image and thus acts as a low-pass filter, limiting the high-frequency content of the final image. A system with resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ cannot resolve details significantly smaller than this dimension.\n\nWhile an imaging system with a Gaussian-like PSF technically passes all frequencies (its Modulation Transfer Function, or MTF, is also a Gaussian that never reaches zero), we must define an effective maximum frequency, $k_{\\text{max}}$, that contains the significant information passed by the system. A standard convention in medical imaging is to relate $k_{\\text{max}}$ to the reciprocal of the spatial resolution. We define the effective maximum frequency of the signal to be sampled as:\n$$k_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}$$\nThis convention associates the highest relevant frequency with a spatial period equal to the system's FWHM. Substituting this expression for $k_{\\text{max}}$ into the Nyquist condition for pixel size gives:\n$$p \\le \\frac{1}{2 \\left(\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}\\right)}$$\n$$p \\le \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2}$$\nThis is the derived condition for adequate sampling. It states that the pixel size $p$ must be less than or equal to one-half of the system's spatial resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}}$. This is equivalent to requiring at least two pixels to span the FWHM of the system resolution.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Pixel Size $p$\n\nThe pixel size $p$ is determined by the Field of View (FOV) and the size of the acquisition matrix. The givens are:\n- FOV dimension $L = 40\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Number of pixels along one dimension $N = 256$\n\nThe pixel size $p$ is calculated as the ratio of the FOV length to the number of pixels:\n$$p = \\frac{L}{N} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{256}$$\n$$p = \\frac{100}{64}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = \\frac{25}{16}\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\n### Step 4: Definition and Computation of Adequacy Factor $A$\n\nThe problem requires a dimensionless adequacy factor, $A$, that equals $1$ at the boundary of adequacy. The boundary condition derived in Step 2 is:\n$$p = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2}$$\nTo define a factor $A$ that is equal to $1$ at this boundary, we can rearrange the equation as:\n$$1 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2p}$$\nThus, we define the adequacy factor $A$ as:\n$$A = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{sys}}}{2p}$$\nThis factor is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of two lengths. For adequate sampling ($p \\le R_{\\mathrm{sys}}/2$), this factor is $A \\ge 1$. For inadequate sampling ($p > R_{\\mathrm{sys}}/2$), $A < 1$.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $A$ using the given parameters:\n- System resolution $R_{\\mathrm{sys}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Calculated pixel size $p = 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition of $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2 \\times 1.5625\\,\\mathrm{mm}}$$\n$$A = \\frac{8}{3.125}$$\n$$A = 2.56$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $2.56$ already has exactly three significant figures.",

In a uniform Region of Interest (ROI), the measured photopeak window counts are $C_{p}$ and the measured lower window counts are $L$. An independent energy calibration study provides an empirically determined proportionality constant $k$ relating scatter in the photopeak window to the lower window activity, together with a standard uncertainty $u_{k}$ associated with $k$. Assume the following measurement data for a single static acquisition: $C_{p} = 64{,}000$ counts, $L = 18{,}000$ counts, $k = 0.45$, and $u_{k} = 0.02$ (dimensionless).\n\nStarting from the foundations of counting statistics and acquisition protocols, use the following principles:\n- In photon counting, under stationary conditions, the number of detected events in a fixed time interval follows a Poisson distribution whose mean equals its variance.\n- Counts recorded in non-overlapping energy windows can be modeled as independent Poisson random variables when pile-up and cross-talk are negligible.\n- A linear estimator for the true photopeak counts is constructed by subtracting a proportional estimate of the scatter contribution inferred from the lower window.\n\nUsing these principles, first construct the estimator for the corrected photopeak counts and then derive, via first-order Taylor expansion (law of propagation of uncertainty) under the independence assumptions, the combined standard uncertainty for the corrected counts.

It describes a standard scatter correction technique in nuclear medicine imaging (the dual-energy window method) and correctly invokes the principles of Poisson counting statistics and the propagation of uncertainty. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the combined standard uncertainty of the scatter-corrected photopeak counts. First, we construct the estimator for these corrected counts. Let $C_{true}$ be the estimator for the true (primary) photopeak counts. The measured photopeak window counts, $C_p$, include both true counts and a contribution from scattered photons. The problem states that a linear estimator is used to correct for this scatter, where the scatter contribution is estimated based on the counts in a lower-energy scatter window, $L$. The relationship is defined by a proportionality constant, $k$.\n\nThe estimated number of scatter counts in the photopeak window is given by the product $kL$. Therefore, the estimator for the true counts is the measured photopeak counts minus the estimated scatter counts:\n$$ C_{true} = C_p - kL $$\nThe quantity $C_{true}$ is a function of three measured or calibrated quantities: $C_p$, $L$, and $k$. Each of these has an associated uncertainty. The problem directs that we treat $C_p$ and $L$ as independent Poisson random variables and $k$ as an independent calibration parameter with a given standard uncertainty $u_k$.\n\nTo find the combined standard uncertainty of $C_{true}$, we use the law of propagation of uncertainty, derived from a first-order Taylor series expansion. For a function $f(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$ of independent random variables $X_i$, the variance of $f$, denoted $\\sigma_f^2$, is approximated by:\n$$ \\sigma_f^2 \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X_i} \\right)^2 \\sigma_{X_i}^2 $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{X_i}^2$ is the variance of the variable $X_i$.\n\nIn our case, the function is $C_{true}(C_p, L, k)$, and the variables are $C_p$, $L$, and $k$. We must first determine the variance for each variable:\n$1$. For the photopeak counts $C_p$: The problem states that photon counting follows a Poisson distribution, for which the variance is equal to the mean. The best estimate of the mean number of counts is the measured value itself. Thus, the variance of $C_p$ is $\\sigma_{C_p}^2 = C_p$.\n$2$. For the lower window counts $L$: Similarly, $L$ is a Poisson random variable, so its variance is $\\sigma_L^2 = L$.\n$3$. For the scatter fraction $k$: This is given as a parameter with a specified standard uncertainty $u_k$. Its variance is therefore $\\sigma_k^2 = u_k^2$.\n\nNext, we compute the partial derivatives of $C_{true}$ with respect to each variable:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial C_p} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial C_p}(C_p - kL) = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial L} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L}(C_p - kL) = -k $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial k} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k}(C_p - kL) = -L $$\n\nNow we substitute these derivatives and variances into the propagation of uncertainty formula to find the variance of $C_{true}$, denoted $\\sigma_{C_{true}}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{C_{true}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial C_p}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{C_p}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial L}\\right)^2 \\sigma_L^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial C_{true}}{\\partial k}\\right)^2 \\sigma_k^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{C_{true}}^2 = (1)^2 (C_p) + (-k)^2 (L) + (-L)^2 (u_k^2) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{C_{true}}^2 = C_p + k^2 L + L^2 u_k^2 $$\n\nThe combined standard uncertainty of the corrected counts, $u_c(C_{true})$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$ u_c(C_{true}) = \\sqrt{C_p + k^2 L + L^2 u_k^2} $$\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$C_{p} = 64000$ counts\n$L = 18000$ counts\n$k = 0.45$ (dimensionless)\n$u_{k} = 0.02$ (dimensionless)\n\nSubstituting these values into the uncertainty equation:\n$$ u_c(C_{true}) = \\sqrt{64000 + (0.45)^2(18000) + (18000)^2(0.02)^2} $$\n\nLet's calculate the terms inside the square root:\nThe contribution from the photopeak counts' variance is $C_p = 64000$.\nThe contribution from the lower window counts' variance, propagated through $k$, is $k^2 L = (0.2025)(18000) = 3645$.\nThe contribution from the uncertainty in the scatter constant $k$ is $L^2 u_k^2 = (18000)^2(0.02)^2 = (324 \\times 10^6)(0.0004) = 129600$.\n\nSumming these terms gives the total variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{C_{true}}^2 = 64000 + 3645 + 129600 = 197245 $$\n\nThe combined standard uncertainty is the square root of this value:\n$$ u_c(C_{true}) = \\sqrt{197245} \\approx 444.12273 \\text{ counts} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ u_c(C_{true}) \\approx 444.1 \\text{ counts} $$\nThis value represents the combined standard uncertainty of the corrected photopeak counts.",
