The cross section $\\sigma(E)$ for each $(p,2n)$ channel exhibits threshold behavior: it is effectively zero below the reaction threshold and rises above it.

The concepts of Q-value, reaction threshold energy, and energy loss of a charged particle in matter are fundamental principles of nuclear physics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear, objective constraints to find a solution. The provided numerical values for masses and Q-values are physically realistic. The request to use nonrelativistic mechanics is a valid approximation for proton kinetic energies in the tens of $\\mathrm{MeV}$ range, where the proton's kinetic energy is a small fraction ($\\approx 2\\%$) of its rest mass energy ($\\approx 938\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2$). The problem is free of scientific flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of Threshold Energy\nWe are asked to derive the laboratory-frame threshold energy, $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$, for an endothermic reaction ($Q<0$) where a projectile of mass $m$ and kinetic energy $E_{\\mathrm{in}}$ strikes a stationary target of mass $M$. At the threshold energy, the final state particles are produced with zero kinetic energy in the center-of-mass (CM) frame.\n\nIn the laboratory frame, the projectile has momentum $p_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\sqrt{2mE_{\\mathrm{in}}}$ and the target is at rest. The total momentum is $P_{\\mathrm{lab}} = p_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The velocity of the CM is given by $v_{\\mathrm{CM}} = \\frac{m v_{\\mathrm{in}}}{m+M}$. The total kinetic energy in the lab frame ($E_{\\mathrm{in}}$) can be partitioned into the kinetic energy of the CM motion and the kinetic energy available within the CM frame, $E'_{\\mathrm{kin}}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} = K_{\\mathrm{CM}} + E'_{\\mathrm{kin}} = \\frac{1}{2}(m+M)v_{\\mathrm{CM}}^2 + E'_{\\mathrm{kin}}$$\nSubstituting $v_{\\mathrm{CM}}$, we get:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{CM}} = \\frac{1}{2}(m+M)\\left(\\frac{m v_{\\mathrm{in}}}{m+M}\\right)^2 = \\frac{m^2 v_{\\mathrm{in}}^2}{2(m+M)} = \\frac{m}{m+M}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}mv_{\\mathrm{in}}^2\\right) = \\frac{m}{m+M}E_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThe kinetic energy available in the CM frame is therefore:\n$$E'_{\\mathrm{kin}} = E_{\\mathrm{in}} - K_{\\mathrm{CM}} = E_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\frac{m}{m+M}E_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{M}{m+M}E_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\nThis is the energy available to initiate the reaction (i.e., to be converted into rest mass). For an endothermic reaction with $Q < 0$, this available energy must at least compensate for the mass deficit, $|Q| = -Q$. The total energy conservation in the CM frame states that the initial total energy (kinetic + rest) equals the final total energy (kinetic + rest). At threshold, the final kinetic energy in the CM frame is zero.\n$$E'_{\\mathrm{kin, th}} + (m+M)c^2 = E'_{\\mathrm{kin, final}} + m_{\\mathrm{final}}c^2$$\n$$E'_{\\mathrm{kin, th}} + (m+M)c^2 = 0 + m_{\\mathrm{final}}c^2$$\n$$E'_{\\mathrm{kin, th}} = (m_{\\mathrm{final}} - (m+M))c^2 = -Q = |Q|$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E'_{\\mathrm{kin}}$ at the threshold energy $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$:\n$$\\frac{M}{m+M}E_{\\mathrm{th}} = |Q|$$\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ gives the required lab-frame threshold energy:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{th}} = |Q|\\frac{m+M}{M} = |Q|\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{M}\\right)$$\n\n### Calculation of Threshold Energies\nWe apply this formula to the two reactions.\n\n1.  **Desired Reaction:** $^{124}\\mathrm{Te}(p,2n){}^{123}\\mathrm{I}$\n    - $Q_{1} = -13.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, so $|Q_1| = 13.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n    - $m = m_{p} \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n    - $M = M(^{124}\\mathrm{Te}) \\approx 124\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n    - The threshold energy is:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{th},1} = (13.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{124}\\right) = (13.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})\\left(\\frac{125}{124}\\right) \\approx 13.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\n2.  **Impurity Reaction:** $^{125}\\mathrm{Te}(p,2n){}^{124}\\mathrm{I}$\n    - $Q_{2} = -17.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, so $|Q_2| = 17.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n    - $m = m_{p} \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n    - $M = M(^{125}\\mathrm{Te}) \\approx 125\\,\\mathrm{u}$.\n    - The threshold energy is:\n    $$E_{\\mathrm{th},2} = (17.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV})\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{125}\\right) = (17.2\\,\\mathrm{MeV})\\left(\\frac{126}{125}\\right) = 17.3376\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\n### Determining the Allowed Incident Energy Range\nThe problem imposes two conditions on the energy of the proton as it traverses the target. The energy window inside the target is $[E_{\\mathrm{out}}, E_{\\mathrm{in}}]$.\n\n- **Constraint 1:** The energy must be sufficient to produce $^{123}\\mathrm{I}$ throughout the target. This means even at the exit, the proton energy must be above the threshold $E_{\\mathrm{th},1}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{out}} \\ge E_{\\mathrm{th},1}$$\nGiven $E_{\\mathrm{out}} = E_{\\mathrm{in}} - S t = E_{\\mathrm{in}} - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, we have:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV} \\ge 13.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} \\ge 16.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\n- **Constraint 2:** The energy must be low enough to avoid producing any of the $^{124}\\mathrm{I}$ impurity. This means even the highest energy (at the entrance of the target) must be below the threshold $E_{\\mathrm{th},2}$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} \\le E_{\\mathrm{th},2}$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} \\le 17.3376\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\nCombining these two constraints, we find the allowed range for the incident proton energy:\n$$16.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV} \\le E_{\\mathrm{in}} \\le 17.3376\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$$\n\n### Evaluation of Options\nWe now check which of the given options for $E_{\\mathrm{in}}$ falls within this allowed range.\n\n- **A. $E_{\\mathrm{in}} = 16.9\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$:**\nThe value $16.9$ lies within the interval $[16.6089, 17.3376]$.\n- Condition 1: $16.9 \\ge 16.6089$. This is true.\n- Condition 2: $16.9 \\le 17.3376$. This is true.\nThus, this incident energy satisfies both constraints.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. $E_{\\mathrm{in}} = 15.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$:**\nThe value $15.0$ is less than the required minimum of $16.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. With this energy, $E_{\\mathrm{out}} = 15.0 - 3.0 = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. Since $12.0\\,\\mathrm{MeV} < E_{\\mathrm{th},1}$, the desired reaction would cease before the proton exits the target, violating the \"throughout the target\" condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. $E_{\\mathrm{in}} = 17.8\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$:**\nThe value $17.8$ is greater than the maximum allowed energy of $17.3376\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. This incident energy exceeds the threshold for the impurity reaction, $E_{\\mathrm{th},2}$, and would lead to the production of the unwanted $^{124}\\mathrm{I}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. $E_{\\mathrm{in}} = 16.6\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$:**\nThe value $16.6$ is less than the calculated lower bound of $16.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. With this energy, $E_{\\mathrm{out}} = 16.6 - 3.0 = 13.6\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. The condition for production throughout the target is $E_{\\mathrm{out}} \\ge E_{\\mathrm{th},1}$. Here, $13.6\\,\\mathrm{MeV} < 13.6089\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. This condition is not met, so production of $^{123}\\mathrm{I}$ would stop just before the proton exits the target.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nOnly option A provides an incident energy that satisfies all the stated conditions.",

To derive the expression for $Y$, we consider a thin slab of the target with thickness $dx$. The number of reactions, $dN_{reac}$, occurring in this slab is given by the product of the number of incident particles, $N_{p}$, the number of target nuclei per unit area, $n \\cdot dx$, and the reaction cross section, $\\sigma(E)$.\n$$\ndN_{reac} = N_{p} \\cdot (n \\cdot dx) \\cdot \\sigma(E)\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of target nuclei per unit volume. The yield in this thin slab, $dY$, is the number of reactions per incident particle:\n$$\ndY = \\frac{dN_{reac}}{N_{p}} = n \\, \\sigma(E) \\, dx\n$$\nThe cross section $\\sigma$ is a function of the proton energy $E$, which changes as the beam penetrates the target. The relationship between depth $x$ and energy $E$ is given by the stopping power, $S(E)$, defined as the energy loss per unit path length:\n$$\nS(E) = -\\frac{dE}{dx}\n$$\nWe can express the differential thickness $dx$ in terms of the energy differential $dE$ as $dx = -dE/S(E)$. Substituting this into the expression for $dY$:\n$$\ndY = -n \\frac{\\sigma(E)}{S(E)} dE\n$$\nTo find the total thick-target yield, we integrate this expression over the energy range of the protons within the target, from the initial energy $E_{0}$ down to the final energy $E_{f}$:\n$$\nY = \\int_{E_{0}}^{E_{f}} -n \\frac{\\sigma(E)}{S(E)} dE = \\int_{E_{f}}^{E_{0}} n \\frac{\\sigma(E)}{S(E)} dE\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the thick-target yield is dependent on the integral of the ratio of the energy-dependent cross section to the stopping power.\n\nIn this problem, the target is a mixture of two isotopes, $^{100}\\mathrm{Mo}$ and $^{98}\\mathrm{Mo}$. The number density of each isotope is $n_{100} = f_{100} n_{target}$ and $n_{98} = f_{98} n_{target}$, where $n_{target}$ is the total number density of molybdenum atoms. The stopping power $S(E)$ is assumed to be a constant, $S_{0}$, for both isotopes.\n\nThe yield of the desired product, $Y_d$, from the $^{100}\\mathrm{Mo}(\\mathrm{p},2\\mathrm{n})$ reaction is:\n$$\nY_{d} = \\int_{E_{f}}^{E_{0}} n_{100} \\frac{\\sigma_{d}(E)}{S_{0}} dE = \\frac{f_{100} n_{target}}{S_{0}} \\int_{14}^{22} \\sigma_{d}(E) dE\n$$\nThe yield of the impurity product, $Y_i$, from the $^{98}\\mathrm{Mo}(\\mathrm{p},2\\mathrm{n})$ reaction is:\n$$\nY_{i} = \\int_{E_{f}}^{E_{0}} n_{98} \\frac{\\sigma_{i}(E)}{S_{0}} dE = \\frac{f_{98} n_{target}}{S_{0}} \\int_{14}^{22} \\sigma_{i}(E) dE\n$$\nThe radionuclidic purity $P$ is given by $P = \\frac{Y_{d}}{Y_{d} + Y_{i}}$.

The parent half-life is $T_{P} = 66.0$ hours and the daughter half-life is $T_{D} = 6.01$ hours. Using only fundamental radioactive decay laws and the coupled production–decay relationship between parent and daughter in a generator, derive from first principles an expression for the daughter activity in the column at time $t_{s}$ and compute the activity that will be collected in the eluent at the second elution at time $t_{s}$, taking into account both the finite elution efficiency at $t_{e}$ and at $t_{s}$.\n\nExpress the final collected activity at time $t_{s}$ in megabecquerel (MBq) and round your answer to four significant figures.",

I will write down the solution clearly, showing all the derivations from first principles as requested.\n\nThe derivation from first principles involves stating the differential equation for the daughter radionuclide.\n$\\frac{dN_D}{dt} = \\text{rate of formation} - \\text{rate of decay}$\n$\\frac{dN_D}{dt} = f\\lambda_P N_P(t) - \\lambda_D N_D(t)$\nwhere $N_P(t) = N_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_P t)$.\nMultiplying by $\\lambda_D$ gives:\n$\\lambda_D \\frac{dN_D}{dt} = f \\lambda_D \\lambda_P N_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_P t) - \\lambda_D (\\lambda_D N_D(t))$.\nRecognizing $A_D = \\lambda_D N_D$ and $A_P = \\lambda_P N_P$:\n$\\frac{dA_D}{dt} + \\lambda_D A_D(t) = f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_P} A_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_P t)$.\nThis is a first-order linear differential equation.\nThe integrating factor is $I(t) = \\exp(\\int \\lambda_D dt) = \\exp(\\lambda_D t)$.\n$\\frac{d}{dt}(A_D(t) \\exp(\\lambda_D t)) = f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_P} A_P(0) \\exp((\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P)t)$.\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n$A_D(t) \\exp(\\lambda_D t) - A_D(0) \\exp(0) = f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_P} A_P(0) \\int_0^t \\exp((\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P)t') dt'$.\n$A_D(t) \\exp(\\lambda_D t) - A_D(0) = f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_P} A_P(0) \\left[ \\frac{\\exp((\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P)t')}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} \\right]_0^t$.\n$A_D(t) \\exp(\\lambda_D t) = A_D(0) + f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(0) (\\exp((\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P)t) - 1)$.\n$A_D(t) = A_D(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_D t) + f \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(0) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D t))$.\nThis is the required derivation \"from first principles\".\n\nThen, I will apply this derived equation for the two time intervals.\n1.  Interval 1: $t \\in [0, t_e]$. Initial conditions: $A_P(0)$, $A_D(0)=0$. $f=1$.\n    $A_D(t) = \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(0) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P t) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D t))$.\n    Calculate $A_D(t_e^{-})$, where $t_e^{-}$ is the time just before elution.\n\n2.  First Elution at $t_e$:\n    Activity removed: $\\eta A_D(t_e^{-})$.\n    Activity remaining: $A_D(t_e^{+}) = (1-\\eta) A_D(t_e^{-})$.\n\n3.  Interval 2: $t \\in [t_e, t_s]$. Let's use a new time variable $\\tau = t - t_e$. The interval is $\\tau \\in [0, t_s - t_e]$.\n    Initial conditions at $\\tau=0$ (i.e., $t=t_e$):\n    Parent activity: $A_P(\\tau=0) = A_P(t_e) = A_P(0)\\exp(-\\lambda_P t_e)$.\n    Daughter activity: $A_D(\\tau=0) = A_D(t_e^{+})$.\n    Now we apply the general formula for this interval:\n    $A_D(\\tau) = A_D(0)\\exp(-\\lambda_D \\tau) + \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(0) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P \\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D \\tau))$.\n    Replace '0' with the start of the interval quantities, and $t$ with $\\tau$:\n    $A_D(\\tau) = A_D(\\text{at } \\tau=0) \\exp(-\\lambda_D \\tau) + \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(\\text{at } \\tau=0) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P \\tau) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D \\tau))$.\n    $A_D(t_s^{-}) = A_D(t_e^{+}) \\exp(-\\lambda_D (t_s - t_e)) + \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(t_e) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P (t_s - t_e)) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D (t_s - t_e)))$.\n    This is the expression the problem asks for: \"an expression for the daughter activity in the column at time $t_s$\".\n    Let's write it out fully in terms of initial parameters.\n    Let $A_{D1} = A_D(t_e^{-}) = \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_P} A_P(0) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P t_e) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D t_e))$.\n    Then $A_D(t_e^{+}) = (1-\\eta) A_{D1}$.\n    And $A_P(t_e) = A_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_P t_e)$.\n    So, $A_D(t_s^{-}) = (1-\\eta) A_{D1} \\exp(-\\lambda_D(t_s - t_e)) + \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D-\\lambda_P} A_P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda_P t_e) (\\exp(-\\lambda_P(t_s - t_e)) - \\exp(-\\lambda_D(t_s - t_e)))$.\n    This is a bit unwieldy. I'll break it down into steps in the solution text. The logic is correct.\n\n4.  Calculate the eluted activity at $t_s$:\n    $A_{collected}(t_s) = \\eta A_D(t_s^{-})$.\n\nAll components are in place. The formatting requirements are strict. Every number, variable, etc., in LaTeX. No markdown headers. The final answer should be in a specific format (`pmatrix` if multiple, but here it's a single value). Single value in a `\\boxed{}`. Final answer is a single number, rounded.\n\nThe problem asks for \"an expression for the daughter activity in the column at time $t_s$\". I should provide this symbolic expression before the numerical calculation. The derivation part covers this.\n\nThe question asks for the collected activity in MBq.\n$A_{P}(0) = 15.0$ GBq $= 1.50 \\times 10^4$ MBq.\nI'll perform the calculations in GBq as it's cleaner with smaller numbers, then convert at the final step. Or I can use MBq throughout. Using MBq from the start is likely better to avoid conversion errors.\n$A_P(0) = 15000$ MBq.\n\nLet's re-run with MBq.\n$A_{D, \\text{pre-elution}}(t_e) \\approx 11.78996$ GBq $= 11789.96$ MBq.\n$A'_D(t_e) = 0.10 \\times 11789.96 = 1178.996$ MBq.\n$A_P(t_e) = 11.65785$ GBq $= 11657.85$ MBq.\nGrowth term: $(1.10018336) \\times (11657.85) \\times (0.6310138) \\approx 12825.6 \\times 0.6310138 \\approx 8093.12$ MBq.\nDecay term: $(1178.996) \\times (0.2505797) \\approx 295.42$ MBq.\n$A_{D, \\text{pre-elution}}(t_s) = 8093.12 + 295.42 = 8388.54$ MBq.\n$A_{D, \\text{collected}}(t_s) = 0.90 \\times 8388.54 = 7549.686$ MBq.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $7550$.\nThis seems correct.",
