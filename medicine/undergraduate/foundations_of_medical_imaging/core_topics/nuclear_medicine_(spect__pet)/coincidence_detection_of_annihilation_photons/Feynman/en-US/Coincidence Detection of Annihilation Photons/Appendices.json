Assume the photon undergoes at most one Compton scatter before either being absorbed or escaping.\n\nStarting from conservation of relativistic energy and momentum for a photon incident on a stationary electron of rest energy $m_e c^2$, derive a general expression for the maximum kinetic energy transferred to the recoil electron in a single Compton interaction as a function of the incident photon energy $E_0$ and $m_e c^2$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete derivation and calculation. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the maximum kinetic energy transferred to a recoil electron in a Compton scattering event, followed by its evaluation for an incident photon energy of $E_0 = 511\\,\\mathrm{keV}$. Let the incident photon have energy $E_0$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_0$, the scattered photon have energy $E'$ and momentum $\\vec{p}'$, and the recoil electron have final kinetic energy $K_e$ and momentum $\\vec{p}_e$. The electron is assumed to be initially at rest, so its initial energy is its rest energy, $m_e c^2$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the principles of conservation of relativistic energy and momentum.\n\nThe conservation of energy is given by:\n$$E_0 + m_e c^2 = E' + E_e$$\nwhere $E_e$ is the total final energy of the electron. The total energy of the electron is the sum of its rest energy and its kinetic energy, $E_e = m_e c^2 + K_e$. Substituting this into the energy conservation equation gives:\n$$E_0 + m_e c^2 = E' + (m_e c^2 + K_e)$$\n$$E_0 = E' + K_e$$\nThis shows that the kinetic energy of the recoil electron is equal to the energy lost by the photon: $K_e = E_0 - E'$.\n\nThe conservation of momentum is a vector equation:\n$$\\vec{p}_0 = \\vec{p}' + \\vec{p}_e$$\nThis can be rearranged to isolate the electron momentum:\n$$\\vec{p}_e = \\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}'$$\nWe can find the magnitude squared of the electron momentum by taking the dot product of this equation with itself:\n$$p_e^2 = (\\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}') \\cdot (\\vec{p}_0 - \\vec{p}') = p_0^2 + p'^2 - 2 \\vec{p}_0 \\cdot \\vec{p}'$$\n$$p_e^2 = p_0^2 + p'^2 - 2 p_0 p' \\cos\\theta$$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the angle between the incident and scattered photon directions. For a photon, energy and momentum are related by $E=pc$. Thus, we can write the above equation in terms of energy:\n$$(p_e c)^2 = (p_0 c)^2 + (p' c)^2 - 2 (p_0 c)(p' c) \\cos\\theta$$\n$$(p_e c)^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\n\nNow we use the relativistic energy-momentum relation for the electron:\n$$E_e^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$$\nSubstituting $E_e = K_e + m_e c^2$:\n$$(K_e + m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$$\n$$K_e^2 + 2 K_e m_e c^2 + (m_e c^2)^2 = (p_e c)^2 + (m_e c^2)^2$$\n$$(p_e c)^2 = K_e^2 + 2 K_e m_e c^2$$\n\nNow we have two expressions for $(p_e c)^2$. Equating them gives:\n$$K_e^2 + 2 K_e m_e c^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\nSubstitute $K_e = E_0 - E'$ into the left side:\n$$(E_0 - E')^2 + 2 (E_0 - E') m_e c^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\n$$E_0^2 - 2 E_0 E' + E'^2 + 2 (E_0 - E') m_e c^2 = E_0^2 + E'^2 - 2 E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\nCanceling terms ($E_0^2$ and $E'^2$) from both sides:\n$$-2 E_0 E' + 2 (E_0 - E') m_e c^2 = -2 E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\nDividing by $2$:\n$$-E_0 E' + (E_0 - E') m_e c^2 = -E_0 E' \\cos\\theta$$\n$$(E_0 - E') m_e c^2 = E_0 E' (1 - \\cos\\theta)$$\nDividing by $E_0 E' m_e c^2$:\n$$\\frac{1}{E'} - \\frac{1}{E_0} = \\frac{1}{m_e c^2} (1 - \\cos\\theta)$$\nThis is the famous Compton scattering formula, which relates the scattered photon energy $E'$ to the incident energy $E_0$ and the scattering angle $\\theta$.\n\nTo find the kinetic energy of the electron, we first solve for $E'$:\n$$\\frac{1}{E'} = \\frac{1}{E_0} + \\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{m_e c^2} = \\frac{m_e c^2 + E_0(1 - \\cos\\theta)}{E_0 m_e c^2}$$\n$$E' = \\frac{E_0 m_e c^2}{m_e c^2 + E_0(1 - \\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$$\nNow, the kinetic energy of the electron is $K_e = E_0 - E'$:\n$$K_e = E_0 - \\frac{E_0}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} = E_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} \\right)$$\n$$K_e = E_0 \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta) - 1}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)} \\right) = E_0 \\frac{\\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(1 - \\cos\\theta)}$$\nThe kinetic energy $K_e$ is maximized when the term $(1 - \\cos\\theta)$ is maximized. This occurs when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which corresponds to the photon backscattering at an angle of $\\theta = \\pi$ or $180^\\circ$. At this angle, $1 - \\cos\\theta = 2$.\nThe maximum kinetic energy, $K_{e,max}$, often called the Compton edge energy, is therefore:\n$$K_{e,max} = E_0 \\frac{\\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(2)}{1 + \\frac{E_0}{m_e c^2}(2)}$$\nThis can be rewritten by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $m_e c^2$:\n$$K_{e,max} = \\frac{2 E_0^2}{m_e c^2 + 2 E_0}$$\nThis is the general expression for the maximum kinetic energy transferred to the recoil electron.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given values: $E_0 = 511\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and $m_e c^2 = 511\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n$$K_{e,max} = \\frac{2 (511\\,\\mathrm{keV})^2}{511\\,\\mathrm{keV} + 2 (511\\,\\mathrm{keV})} = \\frac{2 \\times 511^2}{3 \\times 511}\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\n$$K_{e,max} = \\frac{2 \\times 511}{3}\\,\\mathrm{keV} = \\frac{1022}{3}\\,\\mathrm{keV} \\approx 340.666...\\,\\mathrm{keV}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $340.7\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n\nFinally, we address the complication of multi-site interactions in a thick crystal. The Compton edge at $K_{e,max} \\approx 340.7\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ represents the maximum energy deposited in a *single* Compton scattering event. In an ideal, thin detector, any energy deposition above this value (but below the photopeak) could be attributed to a photon that has already scattered in the patient and thus should be rejected.\n\nHowever, in a thick scintillation crystal (e.g., $\\geq 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the photon scattered inside the crystal has a high probability of interacting again before escaping. The detector's electronics integrate the light produced by all interactions occurring within a very short time window into a single pulse. This pulse's height is proportional to the *sum* of the energies deposited in all interactions. For example, a $511\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ photon might undergo a first Compton scatter, depositing energy $K_{e1}$, and the scattered photon might then undergo a second Compton scatter, depositing $K_{e2}$, before the second scattered photon escapes. The total energy registered by the detector would be $E_{dep} = K_{e1} + K_{e2}$.\n\nThis summed energy $E_{dep}$ can exceed the single-scatter Compton edge, $K_{e,max}$. For instance, a series of two or more forward-scattering events can cumulatively deposit more energy than a single backscattering event. This phenomenon \"fills in\" the region of the energy spectrum between the Compton edge and the full-energy photopeak. As a result, the clean theoretical cutoff at the Compton edge is smeared out. This complicates energy-based scatter rejection because it is no longer possible to cleanly separate true (unscattered in the patient) events that undergo partial energy deposition via multiple scatters in the crystal from events where the photon was scattered in the patient and then detected. Setting an energy window to reject patient scatter becomes a trade-off: a narrow window around the photopeak might incorrectly reject true events with partial energy deposition, reducing sensitivity, while a wider window might incorrectly accept more patient-scattered events, reducing image contrast.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters ($\\lambda$, $\\tau$) and clear, objective conditions for event rejection due to pileup. The parameters are physically realistic for a modern PET scanner. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of true coincidences lost due to pulse pileup. A true coincidence is registered by two detectors, which we will label $D_1$ and $D_2$. The arrival of photons at each detector is modeled as an independent homogeneous Poisson process with a rate of $\\lambda = 2.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. When a photon arrives at a detector, it triggers a shaping circuit that remains active for a fixed time interval $\\tau = 300\\,\\mathrm{ns}$. If a second photon arrives at the same detector during this interval, a pileup event occurs, and the initial event is rejected. A true coincidence is considered lost if pileup occurs in either $D_1$ or $D_2$.\n\nFirst, let us derive the probability of pileup occurring in a single detector. The fundamental property of a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$ is that the time intervals between consecutive events (inter-arrival times) are independent and identically distributed random variables following an exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda$. Let $T$ be the random variable representing the time from the arrival of a triggering photon to the arrival of the next photon at the same detector. The probability density function (PDF) of $T$ is given by:\n$$f_T(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge 0$$\nPileup occurs if this inter-arrival time $T$ is less than the shaping time $\\tau$. The probability of this event, which we denote as $P_{\\text{pileup}}$, is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $T$ evaluated at $t=\\tau$.\n$$P_{\\text{pileup}} = P(T < \\tau) = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\, dt$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$P_{\\text{pileup}} = [-\\exp(-\\lambda t)]_{0}^{\\tau} = (-\\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)) - (-\\exp(0)) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$$\nThis is the probability that a second photon arrives within the shaping time $\\tau$ of a triggered photon, causing pileup in a single detector.\n\nConversely, the probability that a detector does *not* experience pileup for a given triggered event is the probability that the next photon arrives *after* the shaping time $\\tau$ has elapsed.

Let $A_1$ be the event that detector $D_1$ does not experience pileup, and $A_2$ be the event that detector $D_2$ does not experience pileup. The probabilities are:\n$$P(A_1) = P_{\\text{no-pileup}} = \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$$\n$$P(A_2) = P_{\\text{no-pileup}} = \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$$\nSince the arrival processes at the two detectors are independent, the events $A_1$ and $A_2$ are independent. The probability that a true coincidence is correctly classified, $P_{\\text{correct}}$, is the probability that both events occur:\n$$P_{\\text{correct}} = P(A_1 \\cap A_2) = P(A_1) \\times P(A_2) = \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) \\times \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau) = \\exp(-2\\lambda \\tau)$$\n\nThe fraction of true coincidences lost due to pileup, $F_{\\text{lost}}$, is the complement of the probability of a correct classification. This corresponds to the case where pileup occurs in at least one of the detectors (i.e., the union of pileup in $D_1$ and pileup in $D_2$).\n$$F_{\\text{lost}} = 1 - P_{\\text{correct}} = 1 - \\exp(-2\\lambda \\tau)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameters:\n$\\lambda = 2.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\tau = 300\\,\\mathrm{ns} = 300 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless exponent $2\\lambda\\tau$:\n$$2\\lambda\\tau = 2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{s})$$\n$$2\\lambda\\tau = 2 \\times (2.0 \\times 3.0) \\times 10^{5-7} = 12.0 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.12$$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $F_{\\text{lost}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{lost}} = 1 - \\exp(-0.12)$$\nUsing a calculator, we find the value of $\\exp(-0.12)$:\n$$\\exp(-0.12) \\approx 0.886920436$$\nTherefore, the fraction of lost coincidences is:\n$$F_{\\text{lost}} \\approx 1 - 0.886920436 = 0.113079564$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F_{\\text{lost}} \\approx 0.1131$$\nThis is the fraction of true coincidences that are lost due to pulse pileup in either of the two detectors.",
