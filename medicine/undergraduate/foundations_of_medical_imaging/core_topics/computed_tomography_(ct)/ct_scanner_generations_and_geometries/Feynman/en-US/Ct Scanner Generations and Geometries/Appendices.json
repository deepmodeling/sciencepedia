The fan half-angle is $\\gamma$.\n- **Object Geometry**: A disk of radius $R_o$ centered at the isocenter $O$.\n- **Illumination Condition**: The object must be fully illuminated by the fan-beam at every projection angle.\n- **Assumptions**: The detector is sufficiently large; geometric penumbra and finite focal spot size are neglected.\n- **Task 1 (Derivation)**: Derive an expression for the maximal object radius $R_o$ in terms of $R$ and $\\gamma$.\n- **Task 2 (Evaluation)**: Calculate the numerical value of $R_o$ for the specific case where $\\gamma = 48^{\\circ}$ and $R = 550 \\text{ mm}$.\n- **Task 3 (Formatting)**: Round the numerical result to four significant figures and provide it as a single value.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The model described is a standard and fundamental idealization of a fan-beam CT scanner geometry used in medical imaging physics and engineering. The principles involved are from Euclidean geometry and trigonometry, which are mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the *maximal* object radius satisfying a specific geometric constraint, which defines a unique limiting case. The provided information ($R$, $\\gamma$, and the geometric setup) is sufficient to determine a unique solution for $R_o$. Due to the rotational symmetry of the source trajectory and the object, analyzing a single projection view is sufficient.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from the field of medical imaging (e.g., \"isocenter,\" \"fan-beam,\" \"transaxial plane\"). It is free from subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem based on established principles of CT scanner geometry. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nWe begin by modeling the geometry in the transaxial plane. Let the isocenter $O$ be the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system. The X-ray source, denoted by $S$, moves on a circle of radius $R$ centered at $O$. Without loss of generality, we can analyze the geometry at an instant when the source is located at a specific position, for instance, $S = (0, -R)$.\n\nThe object is a disk of radius $R_o$ centered at the origin, so its boundary is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = R_o^2$.\n\nThe fan-beam originates at $S$ and has a total angular width of $2\\gamma$. The central ray of the fan passes from the source $S$ through the isocenter $O$. The two rays at the edges of the fan each make an angle $\\gamma$ with this central ray.\n\nThe condition that the object is \"fully illuminated\" means that the entire object disk must lie within the angular span of the fan-beam. The maximal radius $R_o$ for which this condition holds occurs when the edge rays of the fan-beam are exactly tangent to the boundary of the object disk. If $R_o$ were any larger, parts of the object would lie outside the fan-beam, violating the condition.\n\nLet us consider one of the edge rays, originating from $S$ and tangent to the object disk at a point $T$. We can form a triangle $\\triangle SOT$ with vertices at the source $S$, the isocenter $O$, and the point of tangency $T$.\n\nThe geometric properties of this triangle are as follows:\n1.  The length of the side $SO$ is the distance from the source to the isocenter, which is given as the radius of the source trajectory, so $|SO| = R$.\n2.  The length of the side $OT$ is the radius of the object disk, so $|OT| = R_o$.\n3.  Since the ray $ST$ is tangent to the circular object at point $T$, the radius $OT$ is perpendicular to the tangent line $ST$. Therefore, the triangle $\\triangle SOT$ is a right-angled triangle, with the right angle at vertex $T$.\n4.  The angle $\\angle TSO$ is the angle between the edge ray $ST$ and the central ray $SO$. By definition, this angle is the fan half-angle, $\\gamma$.\n\nIn the right-angled triangle $\\triangle SOT$, the side $OT$ is opposite to the angle $\\angle TSO$, and the side $SO$ is the hypotenuse. The trigonometric relationship between the angle, the opposite side, and the hypotenuse is given by the sine function:\n$$ \\sin(\\angle TSO) = \\frac{\\text{length of opposite side}}{\\text{length of hypotenuse}} $$\nSubstituting the known quantities:\n$$ \\sin(\\gamma) = \\frac{|OT|}{|SO|} = \\frac{R_o}{R} $$\nThis equation relates the maximal object radius $R_o$ to the source-to-isocenter distance $R$ and the fan half-angle $\\gamma$. To find the expression for $R_o$, we simply rearrange the equation:\n$$ R_o = R \\sin(\\gamma) $$\nThis is the derived expression for the maximal object radius from first principles.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are asked to evaluate this expression for the given values $R = 550 \\text{ mm}$ and $\\gamma = 48^{\\circ}$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ R_o = 550 \\times \\sin(48^{\\circ}) $$\nUsing a calculator to find the value of $\\sin(48^{\\circ})$:\n$$ \\sin(48^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.743144825... $$\nNow, we compute the product:\n$$ R_o \\approx 550 \\times 0.743144825... \\text{ mm} $$\n$$ R_o \\approx 408.7296538... \\text{ mm} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $0$, $8$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down by truncating the number after the fourth significant figure.\n$$ R_o \\approx 408.7 \\text{ mm} $$\nThe final numerical answer is $408.7$.",

            "introduction": "A key goal in medical imaging is to acquire the highest quality images with the lowest possible radiation dose. In modern multi-detector CT systems, physical beam characteristics introduce a challenge known as \"overbeaming,\" where the X-ray beam is slightly wider than the active detector area. This practice provides a model to quantify the fraction of radiation dose that does not contribute to image formation, offering critical insight into the concept of dose efficiency in advanced scanner design .",
            "id": "4874526",
            "problem": "A modern third-generation fan-beam Computed Tomography (CT) scanner in a rotate-rotate geometry uses collimation to define the longitudinal beam width at the isocenter. In multi-detector configurations (Multi-Detector Computed Tomography (MDCT)), the finite size of the focal spot and collimator edges produces a penumbra, widening the beam beyond the active detector width and causing overbeaming. Consider a one-dimensional longitudinal ($z$-axis) model in which the beam intensity profile at the isocenter consists of a central top-hat region and linear penumbra on both sides:\n- The central region has uniform intensity $I_{0}$ over width $W$.\n- On each side of the central region, the intensity falls linearly from $I_{0}$ to $0$ over a penumbra width $u$.\n\nThe active detector width is exactly $W$, so only the central region contributes to measured data. Assume the patient’s energy deposition per rotation is proportional to the line integral of beam intensity across the full longitudinal profile (central region plus penumbra on both sides), and that dose scales linearly with intensity and path length in this one-dimensional model.\n\nUsing these assumptions and definitions, derive from first principles an expression for the overbeaming fraction $f_{\\text{over}}$, defined as the fraction of the patient’s delivered dose that provides no image benefit (i.e., dose originating in the penumbra regions that lie outside the active detector width), expressed in terms of $u$ and $W$. Then compute $f_{\\text{over}}$ for $u = 2 \\text{ mm}$ and $W = 40 \\text{ mm}$. Express your final answer as a dimensionless decimal fraction and round to four significant figures.",

The terminology is standard. The problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet the longitudinal axis be the $z$-axis, with the origin at the center of the beam profile. The total dose delivered to the patient, $D_{\\text{total}}$, is proportional to the total integrated intensity across the entire beam profile. The beam profile consists of a central rectangular region and two triangular penumbra regions.\n\n1.  **Dose from the Central Region ($D_{\\text{central}}$)**:\n    This region has a constant intensity $I_0$ over a width $W$. The integrated intensity is the area of this rectangle.\n    $$ \\text{Integrated Intensity (central)} = I_0 \\times W $$\n    So, $D_{\\text{central}} \\propto I_0 W$. This is the useful dose that contributes to the image.\n\n2.  **Dose from the Penumbra Regions ($D_{\\text{over}}$)**:\n    There are two penumbra regions, one on each side of the central region. Each has a width $u$ and an intensity profile that falls linearly from $I_0$ to 0. The shape of each profile is a triangle with base $u$ and height $I_0$. The integrated intensity for one penumbra region is its area:\n    $$ \\text{Area of one triangle} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} u I_0 $$\n    Since there are two such regions, the total integrated intensity from the penumbrae is:\n    $$ \\text{Integrated Intensity (penumbra)} = 2 \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} u I_0 \\right) = u I_0 $$\n    This corresponds to the wasted dose, or overbeaming dose, as it falls outside the active detector area. Thus, $D_{\\text{over}} \\propto u I_0$.\n\n3.  **Total Dose ($D_{\\text{total}}$)**:\n    The total dose is the sum of the dose from the central and penumbra regions.\n    $$ D_{\\text{total}} = D_{\\text{central}} + D_{\\text{over}} $$\n    $$ D_{\\text{total}} \\propto I_0 W + u I_0 = I_0 (W + u) $$\n\n4.  **Overbeaming Fraction ($f_{\\text{over}}$)**:\n    The overbeaming fraction is defined as the ratio of the wasted dose to the total dose.\n    $$ f_{\\text{over}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{over}}}{D_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{u I_0}{I_0 (W + u)} $$\n    The intensity $I_0$ cancels out, leaving the expression purely in terms of the geometric parameters:\n    $$ f_{\\text{over}} = \\frac{u}{W + u} $$\n    This is the derived expression.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nWe are given $u = 2 \\text{ mm}$ and $W = 40 \\text{ mm}$. Substituting these values into our expression:\n$$ f_{\\text{over}} = \\frac{2}{40 + 2} = \\frac{2}{42} = \\frac{1}{21} $$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ f_{\\text{over}} = \\frac{1}{21} \\approx 0.0476190476... $$\nThe problem asks to round the result to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are 4, 7, 6, and 1.
