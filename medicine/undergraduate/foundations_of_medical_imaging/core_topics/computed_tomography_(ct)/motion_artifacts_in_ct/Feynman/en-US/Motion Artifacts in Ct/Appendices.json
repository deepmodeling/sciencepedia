The gantry rotates at constant angular velocity $\\omega=2\\pi$ $\\mathrm{rad/s}$, and projection angles $\\theta$ are measured in radians. The sinogram uses coordinates $(s,\\theta)$, where $s$ is the signed perpendicular distance from the origin to the integration line associated with angle $\\theta$, and $\\theta$ is the projection angle with respect to a fixed laboratory frame.\n\nAssume the anterior direction is the positive $y$-axis.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of the Radon transform and rigid body motion, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe two-dimensional ($2$-D) Radon transform models the data acquisition process in parallel-beam Computed Tomography (CT). The sinogram, denoted by $p(s, \\theta)$, is the set of line integrals of the object's attenuation function, $f(x, y)$. A line is parameterized by its signed perpendicular distance from the origin, $s$, and the angle $\\theta$ its normal vector makes with the positive $x$-axis. The definition of the Radon transform is:\n$$p(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x, y) \\delta(x \\cos\\theta + y \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx \\, dy$$\nwhere $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function.\n\nThe problem states that the object undergoes a rigid anterior translation. The anterior direction is defined as the positive $y$-axis. The translation vector is therefore $\\mathbf{d}(t) = (0, d_y(t))$. The magnitude of this translation, $d_y(t)$, increases linearly with time $t$ from $0$ mm at $t=0$ to $5$ mm at $t=0.2$ s. We can model this linear relationship as $d_y(t) = kt$ for some constant $k$. Using the given conditions:\n$d_y(0.2) = k(0.2 \\text{ s}) = 5 \\text{ mm}$.\nSolving for $k$, we find the rate of translation:\n$$k = \\frac{5 \\text{ mm}}{0.2 \\text{ s}} = 25 \\text{ mm/s}$$\nThus, the displacement of the object along the $y$-axis at any time $t$ in the interval $0 \\leq t \\leq 0.2$ s is given by:\n$$d_y(t) = 25t$$\nwhere $t$ is in seconds and $d_y(t)$ is in millimeters.\n\nA rigid translation of the object by a vector $\\mathbf{d}(t) = (d_x(t), d_y(t))$ transforms the object's attenuation function from $f(x, y)$ to a time-dependent function $f_t(x, y) = f(x - d_x(t), y - d_y(t))$. For the given motion, this becomes:\n$$f_t(x, y) = f(x, y - d_y(t))$$\nThe sinogram measured at time $t$, denoted $p_t(s, \\theta)$, is the Radon transform of this translated function:\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x, y - d_y(t)) \\delta(x \\cos\\theta + y \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx \\, dy$$\nTo relate this to the original sinogram $p(s, \\theta)$, we perform a change of variables in the integral: let $x' = x$ and $y' = y - d_y(t)$. This implies $y = y' + d_y(t)$, and the Jacobian of this transformation is $1$. Substituting these into the integral gives:\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x', y') \\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + (y' + d_y(t)) \\sin\\theta - s) \\, dx' \\, dy'$$\nWe can rearrange the argument of the Dirac delta function:\n$$\\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + y' \\sin\\theta + d_y(t)\\sin\\theta - s) = \\delta(x' \\cos\\theta + y' \\sin\\theta - (s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta))$$\nThe integral now takes the form of the original Radon transform of $f(x', y')$, but evaluated at a shifted $s$ coordinate, $s' = s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta$.\n$$p_t(s, \\theta) = p(s - d_y(t)\\sin\\theta, \\theta)$$\nThis result demonstrates the shift property of the Radon transform: a translation of the object by a vector $(d_x, d_y)$ causes a shift, $\\Delta s$, in the sinogram's $s$-coordinate given by $\\Delta s = d_x \\cos\\theta + d_y \\sin\\theta$. For our problem, $d_x=0$ and $d_y=d_y(t)$, so the sinogram displacement at a given time $t$ and angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$\\Delta s(t, \\theta) = d_y(t) \\sin\\theta$$\nThe problem requires the displacement as a function of time $t$ only. The projection angle $\\theta$ is related to time by $\\theta(t) = \\omega t$, where the angular velocity is given as $\\omega = 2\\pi$ rad/s. Substituting the expressions for $d_y(t)$ and $\\theta(t)$:\n$$\\Delta s(t) = (25t) \\sin(2\\pi t)$$\nThis is the expression for the sinogram displacement in millimeters for $t$ in the interval $[0, 0.2]$.\n\nTo justify the orientation of the predominant blur, we analyze the derived sinogram displacement, $\\Delta s(t) = d_y(t) \\sin(\\theta(t))$. This displacement represents the error or inconsistency in the acquired sinogram data due to the motion. The magnitude of this error is modulated by the term $\\sin(\\theta(t))$.\nThe error is maximized when $|\\sin(\\theta)| = 1$, which occurs at projection angles $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$. At these angles, the parallel X-ray beams are horizontal, meaning they are perpendicular to the direction of motion (the anterior, or $y$, direction). A vertical shift of the object causes the largest possible shift in the horizontal projection data.\nConversely, the error is minimized (zero) when $\\sin(\\theta) = 0$, which occurs at angles $\\theta = 0$ and $\\theta = \\pi$. At these angles, the X-ray beams are vertical, parallel to the direction of motion. A vertical shift of the object merely moves it along the integration paths, which does not change the values of the line integrals. Thus, these projections are not corrupted by the motion.\nIn filtered backprojection (FBP), the algorithm processes all projections. The projections that are most corrupted (those near $\\theta = \\pi/2$ and $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$) introduce significant high-frequency errors into the reconstruction process. When these corrupted and filtered projections are backprojected, they create prominent streaking artifacts. The streaks from an inconsistent projection at angle $\\theta$ are oriented perpendicular to the ray direction at that angle. For corrupted projections near $\\theta = \\pi/2$, the rays are horizontal, and the resulting streaks are vertical (i.e., along the $y$-axis).\nThe cumulative effect of these streaks across the corrupted angular range is a blurring and smearing of features in the reconstructed image. Since the artifacts are most pronounced in the direction perpendicular to the most corrupted views, and those views are perpendicular to the motion, the artifacts are most prominent in the direction of the motion itself. Therefore, a rigid anterior translation (along the $+y$-axis) will produce a predominant blur oriented along the anterior-posterior direction (the $y$-axis).",

In this problem, the two sources are object motion and the finite detector aperture. We are modeling both effects along the detector coordinate $s$.\n\n1.  **Motion Blur PSF**: The object translates at a constant speed $v$ for a duration $\\Delta t$. The total distance of motion projected onto the detector is $d_m$. This distance is given by:\n    $$\n    d_m = v \\cdot \\Delta t\n    $$\n    The problem states that this motion is modeled as a uniform distribution. This corresponds to a rectangular PSF, $p_m(s)$, of width $d_m$. For this to be a valid probability density function, its integral must be $1$. We can express this function, centered at $s=0$, as:\n    $$\n    p_m(s) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{d_m} & \\text{if } |s| \\le \\frac{d_m}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Detector Aperture PSF**: The detector bin has a finite width $w$. This is modeled as a uniform rectangular aperture, which corresponds to a rectangular PSF, $p_d(s)$, of width $w$. Similar to the motion PSF, we write:\n    $$\n    p_d(s) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{w} & \\text{if } |s| \\le \\frac{w}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Variance of a Uniform Distribution**: The RMS blur is the standard deviation, $\\sigma$, which is the square root of the variance, $\\sigma^2$. For a general continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[a, b]$, the variance is $\\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}$. For a rectangular PSF of width $L$ centered at the origin (i.e., on the interval $[-L/2, L/2]$), the variance is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma^2 = \\frac{((L/2) - (-L/2))^2}{12} = \\frac{L^2}{12}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Variances of Individual PSFs**:\n    - The variance of the motion blur PSF, $\\sigma_m^2$, is found by setting $L = d_m$:\n      $$\n      \\sigma_m^2 = \\frac{d_m^2}{12}\n      $$\n    - The variance of the detector aperture PSF, $\\sigma_d^2$, is found by setting $L = w$.

A fundamental property of convolution for independent probability distributions is that the variance of the resulting distribution is the sum of the variances of the individual distributions.\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\text{combined}}^2 = \\sigma_m^2 + \\sigma_{\\text{detector}}^2\n    $$\n    Substituting the expressions for the individual variances:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\text{combined}}^2 = \\frac{d_m^2}{12} + \\frac{w^2}{12} = \\frac{d_m^2 + w^2}{12}\n    $$\n    The RMS blur (standard deviation) of the combined PSF is therefore:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\text{combined}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_m^2 + w^2}{12}}\n    $$\n\n6.  **Ratio Calculation**: The problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{combined}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{detector}}}$.\n    $$\n    R = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{combined}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{detector}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{d_m^2 + w^2}{12}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{w^2}{12}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\frac{d_m^2 + w^2}{12}}{\\frac{w^2}{12}}}\n    $$\n    Simplifying the expression, we get:\n    $$\n    R = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_m^2 + w^2}{w^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_m^2}{w^2} + 1}\n    $$\n\n7.  **Numerical Substitution**: We now substitute the given values into our derived expression for $R$.\n    - Speed: $v = 30 \\text{ mm/s}$.\n    - Acquisition duration: $\\Delta t = 50 \\text{ ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ s} = 0.05 \\text{ s}$.\n    - Detector bin width: $w = 1.0 \\text{ mm}$.\n\n    First, calculate the motion distance $d_m$:\n    $$\n    d_m = v \\cdot \\Delta t = (30 \\text{ mm/s}) \\cdot (0.05 \\text{ s}) = 1.5 \\text{ mm}\n    $$\n    Now, substitute $d_m=1.5$ and $w=1.0$ into the expression for $R$.
