            "introduction": "An ideal imaging system would use a perfect point source of X-rays to create infinitely sharp images. In reality, all X-ray tubes have a source of finite size, known as the focal spot. This exercise guides you through the fundamental geometric principles that determine how the focal spot size translates into image blur, a key factor limiting the spatial resolution of a CT scanner . Understanding this relationship is the first step in appreciating the physical constraints of CT system design.",

            "problem": "A multi-slice fan-beam Computed Tomography (CT) system consists of an X-ray source with a finite focal spot and a flat detector. The source-to-isocenter distance is $R$ and the source-to-detector distance is $D$, so the system magnification is $M = D/R$. Consider in-plane image blur caused solely by the finite size of the X-ray focal spot, with all other blur sources (such as detector bin width, motion, or reconstruction filtering) neglected. Assume the focal spot intensity distribution at the source plane is a one-dimensional Gaussian along the transverse direction with full width at half maximum (FWHM) $s$. A point object is located at the isocenter plane. Under linear projection and backprojection, model the blur induced by the focal spot as the propagation of this Gaussian through the fan-beam geometry, followed by demagnification back to the isocenter plane.\n\nStarting from geometric ray relationships (similar triangles) and properties of Gaussian scaling under linear mappings, derive the effective focal spot blur at isocenter, defined as the FWHM of the point spread function at the isocenter plane due to the finite focal spot. Express your final result as a symbolic expression in terms of $s$ and $M$. Do not introduce any additional approximations beyond the stated Gaussian model and linear geometric propagation. Provide your final answer as a single closed-form expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. If you introduce intermediate quantities such as standard deviation, ensure you clearly relate them to $s$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the effective focal spot blur at the isocenter of a multi-slice fan-beam CT system. This quantity is defined as the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function (PSF) at the isocenter plane, considering only the blur from the finite size of the X-ray source. The givens are the source-to-isocenter distance $R$, the source-to-detector distance $D$, the system magnification $M = D/R$, and the FWHM of the one-dimensional Gaussian focal spot intensity distribution, $s$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two main steps:\n1.  Determine the size of the blur cast by the focal spot onto the detector for a point object at the isocenter. This is the penumbra effect.\n2.  Map this blur size from the detector plane back to the isocenter plane, which corresponds to its representation in the reconstructed image. This involves a demagnification.\n\nLet us model the geometry of the system. We can place the X-ray source on the z-axis at $z=0$. The isocenter plane is at $z=R$, and the flat detector plane is at $z=D$. The transverse direction is represented by the $x$-axis. The point object is located at the isocenter, so its coordinates are $(x, z) = (0, R)$.\n\nThe focal spot is not a single point but has a finite spatial extent at the source plane ($z=0$). The problem states its intensity profile is a Gaussian with FWHM $s$. We can model this by considering the rays emanating from the \"edges\" of the focal spot, which we define by its FWHM width $s$.\n\nLet's analyze the projection using geometric optics and similar triangles. The vertex of the triangles is the point object at the isocenter, $(0, R)$.\nOne triangle is formed by the focal spot and the object point. Its base is the width of the focal spot, $s$, located at the source plane $z=0$. Its height is the distance from the source plane to the object plane, which is $R$.\nA second, larger triangle is formed by the projection of the blur onto the detector and the object point. Its base is the width of the blur profile on the detector, which we will call $s_{\\text{det}}$. This blur profile is located at the detector plane $z=D$. Its height is the distance from the object plane to the detector plane, which is $D-R$.\n\nBy the property of similar triangles, the ratio of the base to the height is the same for both triangles:\n$$\n\\frac{s}{R} = \\frac{s_{\\text{det}}}{D-R}\n$$\nWe can solve this equation for $s_{\\text{det}}$, the FWHM of the blur on the detector:\n$$\ns_{\\text{det}} = s \\frac{D-R}{R}\n$$\nThe problem provides the system magnification $M = D/R$. We can express the blur on the detector in terms of $M$:\n$$\ns_{\\text{det}} = s \\left(\\frac{D}{R} - \\frac{R}{R}\\right) = s(M-1)\n$$\nThe problem states that the focal spot has a Gaussian profile. The geometric projection described by similar triangles is a linear scaling operation. A linear scaling of a Gaussian function results in another Gaussian function. Therefore, if the focal spot profile has a FWHM of $s$, the projected blur profile on the detector is also a Gaussian with its FWHM scaled by the geometric factor, which is precisely $s_{\\text{det}} = s(M-1)$. The use of FWHM directly in the similar triangles argument is valid because FWHM is a linear measure of width that scales identically to the standard deviation for a Gaussian function.\n\nThe second step is to relate this blur at the detector to the effective blur in the reconstructed image. The image is reconstructed in the object's coordinate system, centered at the isocenter. A feature of a certain size at the detector plane corresponds to a feature in the object plane that has been magnified. The magnification for an object at the isocenter is $M$.\n\nAn object of size $L_{\\text{iso}}$ at the isocenter plane is projected to a size $L_{\\text{det}}$ at the detector plane according to the relation:\n$$\nL_{\\text{det}} = M \\cdot L_{\\text{iso}}\n$$\nConversely, to map a feature of size $s_{\\text{det}}$ observed at the detector back to its equivalent size at the isocenter, we must divide by the magnification factor $M$. This process is referred to as demagnification.\n\nLet $s_{\\text{iso}}$ be the effective FWHM of the blur at the isocenter. It is obtained by demagnifying $s_{\\text{det}}$:\n$$\ns_{\\text{iso}} = \\frac{s_{\\text{det}}}{M}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $s_{\\text{det}}$:\n$$\ns_{\\text{iso}} = \\frac{s(M-1)}{M}\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the effective focal spot blur at the isocenter, representing the FWHM of the PSF caused by the finite source size. It is expressed solely in terms of the given parameters $s$ and $M$.\nThe result can also be written as $s \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{M}\\right)$. Since in any physical CT system, the detector is placed beyond the object, we have $D > R$, which implies $M > 1$. Therefore, the term $(M-1)/M$ is a positive fraction less than $1$, indicating that the effective blur at the isocenter is a fraction of the physical focal spot size $s$.",

In short-scan fan-beam image reconstruction, a complete image requires a contiguous span of projection angles equivalent to $180^{\\circ}$ (ignore the fan angle for this problem). The effective temporal resolution is defined as the time duration of the projection data actually used to reconstruct one image at a given phase. Assume the gantry rotates at constant angular speed with rotation time $T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0.28\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nUsing only first-principles reasoning about angular coverage and constant angular velocity, determine the effective temporal resolution for:\n1. single-segment reconstruction on the dual-source system, and\n2. two-segment reconstruction on the same dual-source system, where the required angular span is evenly partitioned across two consecutive heartbeats reconstructed at the same cardiac phase.\n\nExpress each temporal resolution in seconds and round your answers to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the effective temporal resolution of a dual-source computed tomography (CT) scanner for two different reconstruction schemes. The solution will be derived from first principles concerning angular velocity and data acquisition coverage.\n\nFirst, let's establish the fundamental parameters given in the problem.\nThe gantry rotates through $360^{\\circ}$ in a time $T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 0.28\\ \\mathrm{s}$. Since the angular speed is constant, the angular velocity $\\omega$ is given by:\n$$ \\omega = \\frac{360^{\\circ}}{T_{\\mathrm{rot}}} $$\n\nThe CT system is a dual-source scanner with two source-detector systems mounted at a fixed angular separation of $90^{\\circ}$. This means that at any instant in time, projection data is acquired simultaneously from two distinct angular positions. Let the gantry's orientation be described by an angle $\\theta(t)$. Then one source is at $\\theta(t)$ and the second source is at $\\theta(t) + 90^{\\circ}$.\n\nThe core principle for determining temporal resolution in this system is to understand the rate of data acquisition. When the gantry rotates by a small angle $d\\theta$, the first source acquires data over this angular increment, and the second source simultaneously acquires data over the same increment but at a different angular location. Therefore, for a gantry rotation of $\\Delta\\theta$, the total *amount* of unique angular projection data collected is twice the amount collected by a single source, which is $2\\Delta\\theta$. This effectively doubles the speed of angular data acquisition compared to a single-source system.\n\nThe problem states that a complete image reconstruction requires a contiguous span of projection angles equivalent to $180^{\\circ}$ (a \"short scan\" or half-scan). The effective temporal resolution is the time required to acquire the necessary data for the reconstruction.\n\n**1. Single-Segment Reconstruction**\n\nIn a single-segment reconstruction, the entire required angular dataset must be acquired in one continuous time interval.\nThe required angular data span is $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{req}} = 180^{\\circ}$.\nLet $\\Delta\\theta_1$ be the necessary gantry rotation angle to acquire this data. Using our established principle that the amount of data acquired is $2\\Delta\\theta$, we can set up the following equation:\n$$ 2\\Delta\\theta_1 = \\Theta_{\\mathrm{req}} = 180^{\\circ} $$\nSolving for the required gantry rotation:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_1 = \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{2} = 90^{\\circ} $$\nTo verify this, consider a gantry rotation of $90^{\\circ}$. Let the first source start at $0^{\\circ}$ and rotate to $90^{\\circ}$. It covers the angular range $[0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}]$. Simultaneously, the second source, starting at $90^{\\circ}$, rotates to $180^{\\circ}$, covering the angular range $[90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$. The union of these two datasets, $[0^{\\circ}, 90^{\\circ}] \\cup [90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$, forms a complete contiguous span of $[0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$. Thus, a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation is indeed sufficient.\n\nThe effective temporal resolution, $T_{\\mathrm{eff},1}$, is the time taken to perform this $90^{\\circ}$ rotation at the gantry's angular velocity $\\omega$.\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_1}{\\omega} = \\frac{90^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}/T_{\\mathrm{rot}}} = \\frac{90^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = \\frac{1}{4} T_{\\mathrm{rot}} $$\nSubstituting the given value for $T_{\\mathrm{rot}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times 0.28\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.07\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, this is $0.07000\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**2. Two-Segment Reconstruction**\n\nIn a two-segment reconstruction, the required $180^{\\circ}$ angular span is evenly partitioned and acquired over two separate heartbeats. This means the data acquisition is split into two segments, with each segment contributing half of the total required data.\nThe amount of angular data required per segment, $\\Theta_{\\mathrm{seg}}$, is:\n$$ \\Theta_{\\mathrm{seg}} = \\frac{\\Theta_{\\mathrm{req}}}{2} = \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{2} = 90^{\\circ} $$\nThe effective temporal resolution in a multi-segment reconstruction is determined by the time it takes to acquire a single segment of data. Let $\\Delta\\theta_2$ be the necessary gantry rotation to acquire one $90^{\\circ}$ segment of data. Using the same principle as before:\n$$ 2\\Delta\\theta_2 = \\Theta_{\\mathrm{seg}} = 90^{\\circ} $$\nSolving for the required gantry rotation per segment:\n$$ \\Delta\\theta_2 = \\frac{90^{\\circ}}{2} = 45^{\\circ} $$\nThe effective temporal resolution, $T_{\\mathrm{eff},2}$, is the time taken for this $45^{\\circ}$ gantry rotation.\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff},2} = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta_2}{\\omega} = \\frac{45^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}/T_{\\mathrm{rot}}} = \\frac{45^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} T_{\\mathrm{rot}} = \\frac{1}{8} T_{\\mathrm{rot}} $$\nSubstituting the given value for $T_{\\mathrm{rot}}$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{eff},2} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 0.28\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.035\\ \\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, this is $0.03500\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe final answers are the calculated temporal resolutions for the single-segment and two-segment reconstructions, respectively.\nFor single-segment: $T_{\\mathrm{eff},1} = 0.07000\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nFor two-segment: $T_{\\mathrm{eff},2} = 0.03500\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",
