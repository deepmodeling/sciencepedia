            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the time at which the proton signals from water and fat become perfectly out of phase ($180^{\\circ}$) due to the chemical shift effect in a magnetic field, followed by a numerical calculation and an explanation of its significance in MRI.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the phase of a spin precessing harmonically at a constant angular frequency $\\omega$ is that the phase $\\phi$ accumulated over a time $t$ is directly proportional to both frequency and time. Assuming the phase is zero at time $t=0$, the phase at a later time $t$ is given by:\n$$ \\phi(t) = \\omega t $$\nIn MRI, the precession frequency is the Larmor frequency, which is proportional to the local magnetic field experienced by the nucleus. Due to differences in the molecular electronic environment, fat protons are shielded more effectively than water protons. This results in a slightly lower effective magnetic field for fat protons and thus a lower precession frequency.\n\nLet the angular precession frequencies of water and fat protons be $\\omega_W$ and $\\omega_F$, respectively. At time $t=0$, immediately following an radiofrequency (RF) excitation pulse, all spins are in phase. Their respective phases at a later time $t$ are:\n$$ \\phi_W(t) = \\omega_W t $$\n$$ \\phi_F(t) = \\omega_F t $$\nThe relative phase difference $\\Delta \\phi(t)$ between the water and fat magnetization vectors is the difference between their individual phases:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = \\phi_W(t) - \\phi_F(t) = (\\omega_W - \\omega_F) t $$\nThis can be written in terms of the difference in angular frequency, $\\Delta \\omega = \\omega_W - \\omega_F$:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = \\Delta \\omega \\cdot t $$\nThe relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ (in radians per second) and cyclical frequency $f$ (in Hertz) is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Therefore, the difference in angular frequency can be expressed using the difference in cyclical frequency, $\\Delta f = f_W - f_F$:\n$$ \\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\Delta f $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the relative phase difference gives:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi(t) = 2\\pi \\Delta f \\cdot t $$\nWe are asked to find the time $t$ at which the water and fat signals are exactly opposed in phase. This corresponds to a relative phase difference of $180^{\\circ}$, which must be expressed in radians for consistency in the equation. A phase difference of $180^{\\circ}$ is equivalent to $\\pi$ radians.\nSetting $\\Delta \\phi(t) = \\pi$, we can solve for the time $t$:\n$$ \\pi = 2\\pi \\Delta f \\cdot t $$\nSolving for $t$ yields the symbolic expression:\n$$ t = \\frac{\\pi}{2\\pi \\Delta f} = \\frac{1}{2 \\Delta f} $$\nThis is the general expression for the first time at which water and fat protons are in opposed phase.\n\nNow, we evaluate this time numerically using the given water–fat frequency difference, $\\Delta f = 215\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n$$ t = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 215\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = \\frac{1}{430\\,\\mathrm{s}} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ t \\approx 0.00232558... \\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$) and rounded to $4$ significant figures. To convert from seconds to milliseconds, we multiply by $1000$:\n$$ t \\approx 2.32558... \\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives:\n$$ t \\approx 2.326\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\n\nThe significance of this time in gradient-echo MRI is profound. The echo time, denoted as TE, is the time from the center of the RF excitation pulse to the center of the acquired echo. By setting the TE of a gradient-echo sequence equal to the time $t$ we just calculated, the data is acquired precisely when the water and fat signals are opposed in phase. This technique is known as **opposed-phase imaging** (or out-of-phase imaging).\n\nIn a voxel containing a mixture of water and fat, the net signal acquired at an opposed-phase TE will be proportional to the magnitude of the difference between the water signal ($S_W$) and the fat signal ($S_F$), i.e., $|S_W - S_F|$. This signal cancellation at boundaries between fatty and non-fatty tissues creates a characteristic dark boundary artifact, often called the \"India ink\" or \"black boundary\" artifact. This effect is a powerful diagnostic tool. For example, it is used to detect microscopic (intracytoplasmic) fat in tissues, which is a key feature for diagnosing hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) or for distinguishing lipid-rich adrenal adenomas from other adrenal masses.\n\nConversely, if the TE is set to a time when water and fat are back in phase, the signals add constructively. The first time this occurs is at $t' = 2t = \\frac{1}{\\Delta f}$. At this TE, the relative phase is $2\\pi$ radians ($360^{\\circ}$), and the net signal is proportional to the sum of the individual signals, $S_W + S_F$. This is known as **in-phase imaging**. By acquiring two separate gradient-echo images, one at an opposed-phase TE and one at an in-phase TE, clinicians can visually identify and even quantify the amount of fat in a tissue. This dual-echo chemical shift imaging technique is a cornerstone of abdominal and body MRI. The choice of TE is therefore a fundamental parameter that directly controls the fat-related contrast in the final image.",

            "introduction": "Before exploring active fat suppression, it's crucial to understand the passive artifacts that chemical shift creates. This practice demonstrates how a simple frequency difference between tissue types translates into a spatial misregistration in the final image, a phenomenon known as the chemical shift artifact.

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional frequency-encoding (readout) in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) under a constant readout gradient $G_{x}$. Spins with a chemical shift offset experience an off-resonance frequency $\\Delta f$ relative to the receiver reference frequency.

Compute the pixel shift produced by this off-resonance. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures and express the result in pixels (dimensionless).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the chemical shift artifact in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a calculation of the resulting spatial shift in pixels for a given set of acquisition parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Spatial Misregistration**\n\nThe analysis begins with the Larmor equation, which states that the precessional frequency $\\omega$ of a nuclear spin is proportional to the magnetic field strength $B$ it experiences, $\\omega = \\gamma B$, where $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nIn a one-dimensional frequency-encoding experiment, a magnetic field gradient $G_x$ is applied along the $x$-direction, such that the total magnetic field at position $x$ is $B(x) = B_0 + G_x x$. Here, $B_0$ is the static main magnetic field. The Larmor frequency of a spin at position $x$ is therefore position-dependent: $\\omega(x) = \\gamma(B_0 + G_x x)$.\n\nThe MRI signal is typically detected in a frame rotating at the Larmor frequency of the isocenter ($\\omega_0 = \\gamma B_0$). In this rotating frame, the frequency of a spin at position $x$ is $\\omega_{G}(x) = \\omega(x) - \\omega_0 = \\gamma G_x x$.\n\nIf a spin population (e.g., fat) has a chemical shift, it experiences a slightly different local magnetic field, leading to an additional frequency offset $\\Delta \\omega = 2\\pi \\Delta f$ relative to the reference species (e.g., water). This offset is independent of the applied gradient. The total frequency of such a spin in the rotating frame is:\n$$ \\omega_{rot}(x) = \\gamma G_x x + \\Delta \\omega = \\gamma G_x x + 2\\pi \\Delta f $$\nThe complex signal $S(t)$ acquired over a time interval $t$ is the integral of the contributions from all spins across the object, whose spatial distribution is described by the spin density function $\\rho(x)$:\n$$ S(t) = \\int \\rho(x) \\exp(-i \\omega_{rot}(x) t) \\, dx = \\int \\rho(x) \\exp[-i(\\gamma G_x x + 2\\pi \\Delta f)t] \\, dx $$\nThis equation can be separated into two exponential terms:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp(-i 2\\pi \\Delta f t) \\int \\rho(x) \\exp(-i \\gamma G_x x t) \\, dx $$\nThe integral part represents the ideal signal that would be measured in the absence of chemical shift. The core of MRI signal encoding is the relationship between the acquired signal $S(t)$ and the spatial frequency domain, or $k$-space. The $k$-space coordinate $k_x$ is defined by the time integral of the gradient:\n$$ k_x(t) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} \\int_0^t G_x(\\tau) \\, d\\tau $$\nFor a constant readout gradient $G_x$, this simplifies to $k_x(t) = \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} t$. This establishes a linear relationship between acquisition time $t$ and spatial frequency $k_x$. We can express the time dependence of the ideal signal integral as a function of $k_x$:\n$$ \\int \\rho(x) \\exp(-i \\gamma G_x x t) \\, dx = \\int \\rho(x) \\exp(-i 2\\pi k_x x) \\, dx \\equiv S_{ideal}(k_x) $$\nThis shows that the ideal signal in $k$-space, $S_{ideal}(k_x)$, is the Fourier transform of the spin density $\\rho(x)$.\n\nThe measured signal, $S_{meas}$, includes the off-resonance phase term $\\exp(-i 2\\pi \\Delta f t)$. We can express this term as a function of $k_x$ by substituting $t = \\frac{2\\pi k_x}{\\gamma G_x}$:\n$$ S_{meas}(k_x) = S_{ideal}(k_x) \\exp\\left(-i 2\\pi \\Delta f \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_x}{\\gamma G_x}\\right)\\right) = S_{ideal}(k_x) \\exp\\left(-i 2\\pi k_x \\left[\\frac{2\\pi \\Delta f}{\\gamma G_x}\\right]\\right) $$\nThis demonstrates that the off-resonance $\\Delta f$ introduces a linear phase ramp in $k$-space. The phase is directly proportional to $k_x$.\n\nTo understand the consequence in the image domain, we apply the inverse Fourier transform to the measured $k$-space signal to reconstruct the image $I_{meas}(x')$. We use the Fourier shift theorem, which states that multiplication by a complex exponential $\\exp(-i 2\\pi k_x x_0)$ in the frequency domain corresponds to a spatial shift $x_0$ in the spatial domain.\nLet's define the spatial shift $\\Delta x$ as:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta f}{\\gamma G_x} $$\nThen the measured signal is $S_{meas}(k_x) = S_{ideal}(k_x) \\exp(-i 2\\pi k_x \\Delta x)$. The reconstructed image is:\n$$ I_{meas}(x') = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{S_{meas}(k_x)\\} = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{S_{ideal}(k_x) \\exp(-i 2\\pi k_x \\Delta x)\\} $$\nApplying the shift theorem, with $I_{ideal}(x') = \\mathcal{F}^{-1}\\{S_{ideal}(k_x)\\} = \\rho(x')$, we get:\n$$ I_{meas}(x') = \\rho(x' - \\Delta x) $$\nThis result shows that the chemical shift $\\Delta f$ causes the reconstructed image of the off-resonant species to be spatially misregistered by an amount $\\Delta x$ along the frequency-encoding direction.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Misregistration in Pixels**\n\nTo express the spatial shift $\\Delta x$ in terms of pixels, we must first determine the size of a single pixel, $\\delta x$. In a discrete acquisition with $N$ samples, the pixel size is the field of view ($FOV_x$) divided by the number of pixels, $\\delta x = FOV_x / N$.\n\nThe $FOV_x$ is related to the readout (sampling) bandwidth, which is given as the sampling frequency $f_s$. The gradient $G_x$ maps the spatial extent of the $FOV_x$ to this frequency range:\n$$ f_s = BW_{readout} = \\frac{\\gamma G_x}{2\\pi} FOV_x $$\nFrom this, we can express the $FOV_x$ in terms of the acquisition parameters:\n$$ FOV_x = \\frac{2\\pi f_s}{\\gamma G_x} $$\nThe pixel size is therefore:\n$$ \\delta x = \\frac{FOV_x}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{2\\pi f_s}{\\gamma G_x} $$\nThe misregistration in pixels, $\\Delta p$, is the ratio of the spatial shift $\\Delta x$ to the pixel size $\\delta x$:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\delta x} = \\frac{\\frac{2\\pi \\Delta f}{\\gamma G_x}}{\\frac{1}{N} \\frac{2\\pi f_s}{\\gamma G_x}} $$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling the common terms ($2\\pi$, $\\gamma$, $G_x$) yields the final formula for the pixel shift:\n$$ \\Delta p = \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s / N} = N \\frac{\\Delta f}{f_s} $$\nThis shows that the pixel shift is the ratio of the off-resonance frequency to the bandwidth per pixel ($f_s/N$).\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Number of readout samples: $N = 256$\n- Sampling frequency: $f_s = 5.0 \\times 10^4 \\text{ Hz}$\n- Off-resonance frequency: $\\Delta f = 100 \\text{ Hz}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ \\Delta p = 256 \\times \\frac{100}{5.0 \\times 10^4} = 256 \\times \\frac{1}{500} = \\frac{256}{500} = 0.512 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $0.512$ already meets this requirement. The resulting misregistration is $0.512$ pixels.",

The longitudinal component is $M_z(0^{-}) = M_0^{\\mathrm{fat}}$, and we assume the transverse components are zero. The magnetization vector is $\\mathbf{M}(0^{-}) = (0, 0, M_0^{\\mathrm{fat}})$.\n\n2.  **Effect of the RF Pulse**: The spectrally selective RF pulse is designed to invert the fat magnetization. This is modeled as a rigid rotation of the magnetization vector. An ideal inversion corresponds to a flip angle of $\\theta = 180^{\\circ}$. Due to $B_1$ inhomogeneity, the actual flip angle is $\\theta = 150^{\\circ}$. The rotation occurs about an axis in the transverse ($x$-$y$) plane. Let's assume the rotation is about the $x$-axis.
