By deriving the spacing of signal nulls as a function of the repetition time ($TR$), you will gain a core understanding of how bSSFP's signal intensity is modulated by off-resonance effects .

            "problem": "A Balanced Steady-State Free Precession (bSSFP) magnetic resonance imaging sequence uses fully balanced gradients within each repetition time so that net gradient moment per repetition is zero. Consider a single isochromat in the rotating frame with longitudinal relaxation time $T_1$, transverse relaxation time $T_2$, repetition time $TR$, flip angle $\\alpha$, and off-resonance frequency $f$ (in Hz). Over each $TR$, the isochromat accrues an off-resonance phase $\\Delta \\phi = 2\\pi f TR$ due solely to $f$ because the gradients are balanced.\n\nStarting from the Bloch equation in the rotating frame and the fact that balanced gradients produce a time-symmetric refocusing at echo time $TR/2$, reason from first principles about the coherence pathways to derive an analytic expression for the frequency spacing between successive magnitude nulls of the steady-state transverse signal in bSSFP as a function of $TR$. Then, using your expression, compute the spacing in Hz when $TR = 3.0$ ms. Express the frequency spacing in Hz and round your numerical answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the frequency spacing between successive magnitude nulls in a Balanced Steady-State Free Precession (bSSFP) signal as a function of the repetition time $TR$, and then a numerical calculation for a given $TR$.\n\nThe foundation of the bSSFP sequence is the establishment of a dynamic equilibrium, or steady state, for the magnetization. In this state, the magnetization vector at the beginning of any given repetition time ($TR$) interval is identical to the vector at the beginning of any other $TR$ interval, except for a phase shift in the transverse plane.\n\nLet's analyze the evolution of a single isochromat with an off-resonance frequency $f$. In the rotating frame, this off-resonance causes the magnetization vector to precess at an angular frequency of $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Over the course of one repetition time, $TR$, the total phase accrued by the transverse component of the magnetization due to this off-resonance is $\\Delta \\phi = \\omega TR = 2\\pi f TR$. The problem statement correctly notes that because the imaging gradients are fully balanced, their net contribution to the phase over one $TR$ is zero. Therefore, the only source of net phase accumulation from one $TR$ to the next is the off-resonance $f$.\n\nThe steady-state signal in bSSFP is a function of the tissue parameters ($T_1$, $T_2$), the sequence parameters ($\\alpha$, $TR$), and the off-resonance phase $\\Delta\\phi$. The signal arises from the coherent sum of multiple coherence pathways. The crucial insight is that the steady-state response of the magnetization must be periodic with respect to the off-resonance phase $\\Delta\\phi$. Any physical state of the magnetization, and thus the signal magnitude $|S|$, must be identical if the phase $\\Delta\\phi$ is shifted by an integer multiple of $2\\pi$. That is, $|S(\\Delta\\phi)| = |S(\\Delta\\phi + 2\\pi n)|$ for any integer $n$.\n\nThe bSSFP signal profile exhibits bands of high signal (passbands) separated by signal nulls (stopbands). A signal null represents maximum destructive interference. For a sequence with constant RF pulse phase, maximum constructive interference occurs at on-resonance ($f=0$, thus $\\Delta\\phi=0$). The first signal null occurs when the phase accumulated over one $TR$ is an odd multiple of $\\pi$. Specifically, the first null occurs at $\\Delta\\phi = \\pi$. Subsequent nulls appear each time the phase increases by another $2\\pi$ from a previous null's position. In general, the signal nulls are located at off-resonance frequencies $f_{null}$ that satisfy the condition:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi f_{null} TR = (2n+1)\\pi $$\nwhere $n$ is an integer. Solving for $f_{null}$ gives the frequencies of the nulls:\n$$ f_{null, n} = \\frac{2n+1}{2TR} $$\n\nTo find the frequency spacing between successive nulls, we calculate the difference between the frequencies of the $(n+1)$-th null and the $n$-th null. Let this spacing be denoted by $\\Delta f_{spacing}$.\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = f_{null, n+1} - f_{null, n} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $f_{null}$:\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = \\frac{2(n+1)+1}{2TR} - \\frac{2n+1}{2TR} $$\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = \\frac{(2n+2+1) - (2n+1)}{2TR} = \\frac{2n+3 - 2n-1}{2TR} = \\frac{2}{2TR} $$\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = \\frac{1}{TR} $$\nThis is the analytic expression for the frequency spacing between successive magnitude nulls. It depends solely on the repetition time $TR$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this spacing for the given $TR$.\nThe repetition time is given as $TR = 3.0$ ms. We must convert this to SI units (seconds) for the frequency to be in Hertz (Hz).\n$$ TR = 3.0 \\, \\text{ms} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s} $$\nUsing the derived expression for the spacing:\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = \\frac{1}{TR} = \\frac{1}{3.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{s}} $$\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} = \\frac{1000}{3.0} \\, \\text{Hz} \\approx 333.333... \\, \\text{Hz} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta f_{spacing} \\approx 333 \\, \\text{Hz} $$",

Being constrained to a low flip angle by the SAR limit means the sequence is operating in a SAR-limited regime, not a contrast-optimized one. This will result in lower overall SNR compared to what could be achieved with a higher flip angle. While the fundamental $T_2/T_1$ contrast is preserved, the reduced SNR degrades the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), potentially making anatomical borders (like that between blood and myocardium) less distinct and impairing diagnostic quality.
