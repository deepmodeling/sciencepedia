It is a valid problem in the foundations of medical imaging, specifically concerning motion artifacts in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the phase accrual of a spin in the presence of a magnetic field gradient is that the gradient superimposes a spatially dependent shift on the Larmor frequency. The instantaneous angular frequency shift, $\\omega(t)$, for a spin at position $x(t)$ along a one-dimensional gradient $G(t)$ is given as:\n$$ \\omega(t) = \\gamma \\, G(t) \\, x(t) $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio.\n\nThe problem specifies the following models:\n1.  The position of the moving spin ensemble along the phase-encoding axis is $x(t) = x_0 + v \\, t$, where $x_0$ is the initial position at $t=0$ and $v$ is the constant velocity.\n2.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetic resonance imaging, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from ambiguity or contradiction. The provided parameters are physically realistic for a clinical MRI setting. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of three quantities related to motion artifacts in a gradient-echo MRI sequence: the displacement of spins during readout, the resulting frequency broadening, and the spatial smearing in terms of voxels.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Spin Displacement, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{ro}}$**\n\nWe are given that spins are moving with a constant velocity $v$ along the $+x$-direction. The definition of constant velocity is given as $v = \\frac{dx}{dt}$. To find the total displacement, $\\Delta x$, over a given time interval, $\\Delta t$, we can integrate this equation:\n$$ \\Delta x = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} v \\, dt $$\nSince $v$ is constant, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta x = v \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} dt = v \\Delta t $$\nThe time interval during which the motion affects the readout is the readout duration itself, which is given as $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$. Therefore, the displacement of spins during the readout, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{ro}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{ro}} = v T_{\\mathrm{ro}} $$\nThis expression gives the displacement in terms of the spin velocity $v$ and the readout duration $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$, as required.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Frequency Broadening, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}}$**\n\nThe frequency of a spin is determined by the local magnetic field it experiences, according to the Larmor relationship $f = (\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}) B$. The problem states that the total magnetic field $B(x)$ along the $x$-direction is the sum of the static field $B_0$ and the field from the frequency-encoding gradient $G_x$:\n$$ B(x) = B_0 + G_x x $$\nSubstituting this into the Larmor equation gives the frequency of a stationary spin at position $x$:\n$$ f(x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_0 + G_x x) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x $$\nNow, consider a spin moving with constant velocity $v$. Its position at time $t$ during the readout (where $t$ ranges from $0$ to $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$) can be described as $x(t) = x_{\\mathrm{start}} + v t$, where $x_{\\mathrm{start}}$ is the position at the beginning of the readout. The instantaneous frequency of this moving spin is therefore a function of time:\n$$ f(t) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B(x(t)) = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} (B_0 + G_x (x_{\\mathrm{start}} + v t)) $$\n$$ f(t) = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x_{\\mathrm{start}}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x v\\right) t $$\nThe frequency of the moving spin changes linearly with time during the readout. The \"frequency broadening\" or \"span of the instantaneous frequency\" caused by this motion is the total change in frequency over the duration $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$. This is the difference between the frequency at the end of the readout ($t = T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$) and the frequency at the start of the readout ($t = 0$):\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}} = f(T_{\\mathrm{ro}}) - f(0) $$\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}} = \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x_{\\mathrm{start}}\\right) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x v T_{\\mathrm{ro}}\\right] - \\left[\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} B_0 + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x x_{\\mathrm{start}}\\right) + \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x v \\cdot 0\\right] $$\nSimplifying this expression, we find:\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x v T_{\\mathrm{ro}} $$\nThis expression gives the frequency broadening in terms of $\\gamma$, $G_x$, $v$, and $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$, as required.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of Edge Smearing, $L_{\\mathrm{vox}}$**\n\nEdge smearing in the reconstructed image is the spatial manifestation of the frequency broadening. To express this smearing in units of voxels, we must first determine the size of a voxel in the frequency domain and in the spatial domain.\n\nThe spatial resolution along the readout direction, or the voxel size $\\delta x$, is determined by the field of view $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$ and the number of samples (which corresponds to the number of voxels) $N_x$:\n$$ \\delta x = \\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{N_x} $$\nThe total bandwidth of the readout, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{total}}$, required to encode the entire $\\mathrm{FOV}_x$ is given by the change in frequency across the FOV:\n$$ \\Delta f_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x $$\nThis total bandwidth is divided into $N_x$ frequency bins, so the frequency width per voxel, $\\delta f_{\\mathrm{vox}}$, is:\n$$ \\delta f_{\\mathrm{vox}} = \\frac{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{total}}}{N_x} = \\frac{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x}{N_x} $$\nThe extent of smearing in voxels, $L_{\\mathrm{vox}}$, is the motion-induced frequency broadening $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}}$ divided by the frequency width of a single voxel, $\\delta f_{\\mathrm{vox}}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{vox}} = \\frac{\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}}}{\\delta f_{\\mathrm{vox}}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{broad}}$ and $\\delta f_{\\mathrm{vox}}$:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{vox}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x v T_{\\mathrm{ro}}}{\\frac{\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi} G_x \\mathrm{FOV}_x}{N_x}} $$\nThe terms $\\frac{\\gamma}{2\\pi}$ and $G_x$ cancel, yielding:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{vox}} = \\frac{v T_{\\mathrm{ro}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{FOV}_x}{N_x}} $$\nRecognizing that the numerator is the displacement $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{ro}}$ from Part 1, we get:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{vox}} = \\frac{\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{ro}} N_x}{\\mathrm{FOV}_x} $$\nThis is the required expression for the smearing extent in voxels.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe now evaluate these quantities using the provided parameters.
