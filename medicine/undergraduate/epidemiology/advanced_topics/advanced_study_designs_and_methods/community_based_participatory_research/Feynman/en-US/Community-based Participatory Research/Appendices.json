            "problem": "In a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) environmental health project, pairs of trained community data collectors independently classified each household’s dust hazard severity into one of $3$ ordered categories: low risk $(L)$, moderate risk $(M)$, and high risk $(H)$. For a single instrument reliability audit, one representative pair (Rater A and Rater B) independently assessed the same set of households. Their joint classifications are summarized by the following $3 \\times 3$ contingency counts, where rows correspond to Rater A’s category and columns correspond to Rater B’s category:\n- $c_{LL} = 48$, $c_{LM} = 6$, $c_{LH} = 3$\n- $c_{ML} = 8$, $c_{MM} = 32$, $c_{MH} = 5$\n- $c_{HL} = 2$, $c_{HM} = 9$, $c_{HH} = 10$\n\nUsing first principles from probability and measurement in epidemiology, derive the chance-corrected inter-rater agreement coefficient for these categorical assessments by:\n- Defining and computing the observed agreement probability from the contingency data.\n- Constructing the expected agreement probability under independence from the marginal category distributions.\n- Normalizing the observed agreement beyond chance by the maximum possible agreement beyond chance to obtain the coefficient.\n\nExpress the final coefficient as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a chance-corrected inter-rater agreement coefficient. This coefficient is commonly known as Cohen's Kappa ($\\kappa$). It measures the agreement between two raters, accounting for the agreement that would be expected purely by chance. The derivation will follow the three steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we organize the provided data into a $3 \\times 3$ contingency table. Let the rows represent the ratings of Rater A and the columns represent the ratings of Rater B. The categories are Low risk ($L$), Moderate risk ($M$), and High risk ($H$). The cell counts, $c_{ij}$, represent the number of households classified in category $i$ by Rater A and category $j$ by Rater B.\n\nThe contingency table is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc|c}\n\\text{Rater A} & \\text{Rater B: } L & \\text{Rater B: } M & \\text{Rater B: } H & \\text{Row Total} \\\\\n\\hline\nL & 48 & 6 & 3 & r_L = 57 \\\\\nM & 8 & 32 & 5 & r_M = 45 \\\\\nH & 2 & 9 & 10 & r_H = 21 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Col Total} & c_L = 58 & c_M = 47 & c_H = 18 & N = 123\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe total number of households assessed, $N$, is the sum of all cell counts:\n$$N = c_{LL} + c_{LM} + c_{LH} + c_{ML} + c_{MM} + c_{MH} + c_{HL} + c_{HM} + c_{HH}$$\n$$N = 48 + 6 + 3 + 8 + 32 + 5 + 2 + 9 + 10 = 123$$\nWe also calculate the row totals ($r_i$) and column totals ($c_j$), which represent the marginal frequencies for each rater.\nRow totals:\n$r_L = 48+6+3 = 57$\n$r_M = 8+32+5 = 45$\n$r_H = 2+9+10 = 21$\nSum of row totals: $57+45+21 = 123 = N$.\n\nColumn totals:\n$c_L = 48+8+2 = 58$\n$c_M = 6+32+9 = 47$\n$c_H = 3+5+10 = 18$\nSum of column totals: $58+47+18 = 123 = N$.\n\nStep 1: Define and compute the observed agreement probability ($p_o$).\nThe observed agreement is the proportion of households for which both raters assigned the same category. These are the counts along the main diagonal of the contingency table.\nThe number of agreements is the sum of diagonal elements:\n$$N_{agree} = c_{LL} + c_{MM} + c_{HH} = 48 + 32 + 10 = 90$$\nThe observed probability of agreement, $p_o$, is the ratio of the number of agreements to the total number of observations:\n$$p_o = \\frac{N_{agree}}{N} = \\frac{90}{123}$$\n\nStep 2: Construct the expected agreement probability ($p_e$) under independence.\nThe expected probability of agreement by chance is calculated based on the marginal distributions of the raters' classifications. Under the assumption of independence, the probability that both raters classify a household into a specific category $k$ is the product of their individual probabilities of choosing that category.\nThe probability for Rater A to choose category $k$ is $p_{A,k} = \\frac{r_k}{N}$.\nThe probability for Rater B to choose category $k$ is $p_{B,k} = \\frac{c_k}{N}$.\nThe total expected probability of agreement, $p_e$, is the sum of the probabilities of chance agreement for each category:\n$$p_e = \\sum_{k \\in \\{L, M, H\\}} p_{A,k} \\cdot p_{B,k} = p_{A,L}p_{B,L} + p_{A,M}p_{B,M} + p_{A,H}p_{B,H}$$\n$$p_e = \\left(\\frac{r_L}{N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{c_L}{N}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{r_M}{N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{c_M}{N}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{r_H}{N}\\right)\\left(\\frac{c_H}{N}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$p_e = \\frac{1}{N^2} (r_L c_L + r_M c_M + r_H c_H)$$\n$$p_e = \\frac{1}{123^2} ((57)(58) + (45)(47) + (21)(18))$$\n$$p_e = \\frac{1}{15129} (3306 + 2115 + 378)$$\n$$p_e = \\frac{5799}{15129}$$\n\nStep 3: Normalize to obtain the coefficient.\nThe problem defines the coefficient as the normalization of \"observed agreement beyond chance\" by the \"maximum possible agreement beyond chance\".\nThe observed agreement beyond chance is the difference between the observed agreement and the expected agreement: $p_o - p_e$.\nThe maximum possible agreement is $1$. Therefore, the maximum possible agreement beyond chance is $1 - p_e$.\nThe coefficient, $\\kappa$, is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e}$$\nNow, we substitute the calculated values of $p_o$ and $p_e$:\n$$p_o = \\frac{90}{123} = \\frac{90 \\times 123}{123 \\times 123} = \\frac{11070}{15129}$$\n$$p_e = \\frac{5799}{15129}$$\nNow substitute these into the kappa formula:\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{\\frac{11070}{15129} - \\frac{5799}{15129}}{1 - \\frac{5799}{15129}} = \\frac{\\frac{11070 - 5799}{15129}}{\\frac{15129 - 5799}{15129}}$$\n$$\\kappa = \\frac{5271}{9330}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures:\n$$\\kappa = 0.564951768...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\kappa \\approx 0.5650$$\nThe trailing zero is significant.",

The sample variance $s^2$ of a set of observations $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ with mean $\\bar{x}$ is given by $s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{k=1}^n(x_k - \\bar{x})^2$.\n\nFor the Intervention community:\nThe changes are $\\{-0.1, -0.102632, -0.1, -0.1, -0.07\\}$ with mean $\\overline{\\Delta Y_I} \\approx -0.094526$.\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_I} = \\frac{1}{5-1} \\left[ (-0.1 - (-0.094526))^2 + (-0.102632 - (-0.094526))^2 + (-0.1 - (-0.094526))^2 + (-0.1 - (-0.094526))^2 + (-0.07 - (-0.094526))^2 \\right] $$\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_I} \\approx \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (-0.005474)^2 + (-0.008106)^2 + (-0.005474)^2 + (-0.005474)^2 + (0.024526)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_I} \\approx \\frac{1}{4} [2.996 \\times 10^{-5} + 6.571 \\times 10^{-5} + 2.996 \\times 10^{-5} + 2.996 \\times 10^{-5} + 6.0152 \\times 10^{-4}] \\approx \\frac{0.0007571}{4} \\approx 0.00018928 $$\n\nFor the Comparison community:\nThe changes are $\\{0, -0.05, 0, -0.04, -0.05\\}$ with mean $\\overline{\\Delta Y_C} = -0.028$.\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_C} = \\frac{1}{5-1} \\left[ (0 - (-0.028))^2 + (-0.05 - (-0.028))^2 + (0 - (-0.028))^2 + (-0.04 - (-0.028))^2 + (-0.05 - (-0.028))^2 \\right] $$\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_C} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (0.028)^2 + (-0.022)^2 + (0.028)^2 + (-0.012)^2 + (-0.022)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ s^2_{\\Delta Y_C} = \\frac{1}{4} [0.000784 + 0.000484 + 0.000784 + 0.000144 + 0.000484] = \\frac{0.00268}{4} = 0.00067 $$\n\nThe variance of the ATT estimator is the sum of the variances of the two sample means:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\text{ATT}}) = \\text{Var}(\\overline{\\Delta Y_I}) + \\text{Var}(\\overline{\\Delta Y_C}) = \\frac{s^2_{\\Delta Y_I}}{N_I} + \\frac{s^2_{\\Delta Y_C}}{N_C} $$\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\text{ATT}}) \\approx \\frac{0.00018928}{5} + \\frac{0.00067}{5} \\approx 0.000037856 + 0.000134 = 0.000171856 $$\n\nThe cluster-robust standard error is the square root of this variance:\n$$ SE(\\hat{\\text{ATT}}) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\text{ATT}})} \\approx \\sqrt{0.000171856} \\approx 0.013109 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $SE(\\hat{\\text{ATT}}) \\approx 0.01311$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the estimated ATT and its cluster-robust standard error.\nEstimated ATT $\\approx -0.06653$.\nCluster-robust standard error $\\approx 0.01311$.",
