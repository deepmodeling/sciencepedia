            "introduction": "Before we can model changes over time, we must first be able to quantify outcomes from discrete samples. This exercise uses a quality control scenario, analogous to evaluating the impact of a public health intervention by sampling individuals from a population. By calculating the probability of finding a certain number of flawed items, you will practice the combinatorial logic that underpins the statistical tests used to determine an intervention's significance in an Interrupted Time Series (ITS) analysis .",

            "problem": "An electronics factory produces microchips. A batch of these chips contains $N_f$ flawed chips and $N_p$ perfect chips. For a quality control check, a sample of $n$ chips is drawn at random and without replacement from the batch.\n\nLet $X$ be the discrete random variable representing the number of flawed chips found in the sample. We are interested in the probability of finding exactly $x$ flawed chips in the sample, denoted by $P(X=x)$.\n\n**Task:**\nFirst, derive a general symbolic expression for the probability mass function (PMF) of $X$, $P(X=x)$, in terms of $N_f$, $N_p$, $n$, and $x$. Assume that the value of $x$ is a possible outcome.\n\nThen, using the general formula you derived, calculate the specific probability of finding exactly $x=2$ flawed chips when sampling $n=3$ chips from a batch containing $N_f=5$ flawed chips and $N_p=5$ perfect chips.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the probability of a specific composition in a sample drawn without replacement. We approach this using the fundamental principles of combinatorial probability. The probability of an event is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n$P(\\text{Event}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of possible outcomes.**\n\nThe total number of items in the batch is $N = N_f + N_p$. We are drawing a sample of size $n$ from these $N$ items without replacement. The total number of ways to choose $n$ items from a set of $N$ items is given by the binomial coefficient \"N choose n\", which is written as $\\binom{N}{n}$.\n\nTotal number of outcomes = $\\binom{N_f + N_p}{n}$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the number of favorable outcomes.**\n\nA favorable outcome is one where the sample contains exactly $x$ flawed chips and, consequently, $n-x$ perfect chips. We can calculate the number of ways to achieve this by using the multiplication principle of counting.\n\nFirst, we find the number of ways to choose $x$ flawed chips from the available $N_f$ flawed chips. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N_f}{x}$.\nNumber of ways to choose flawed chips = $\\binom{N_f}{x}$\n\nSecond, we find the number of ways to choose the remaining $n-x$ chips from the available $N_p$ perfect chips. This is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{N_p}{n-x}$.\nNumber of ways to choose perfect chips = $\\binom{N_p}{n-x}$\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is the product of these two quantities:\nNumber of favorable outcomes = $\\binom{N_f}{x} \\binom{N_p}{n-x}$\n\n**Step 3: Derive the general expression for the probability $P(X=x)$.**\n\nBy combining the results from Step 1 and Step 2, we can write the expression for the probability mass function (PMF) of the random variable $X$:\n\n$$P(X=x) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{\\binom{N_f}{x} \\binom{N_p}{n-x}}{\\binom{N_f + N_p}{n}}$$\n\nThis is the general symbolic expression for the PMF.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the specific probability for the given values.**\n\nWe are asked to calculate $P(X=2)$ for the case where $N_f=5$, $N_p=5$, and $n=3$.

The formula for $\\binom{n}{k}$ is $\\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$.\n\n$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10$\n\n$\\binom{5}{1} = \\frac{5!}{1!(5-1)!} = \\frac{5!}{1!4!} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5$\n\n$\\binom{10}{3} = \\frac{10!}{3!(10-3)!} = \\frac{10!}{3!7!} = \\frac{10 \\times 9 \\times 8}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 10 \\times 3 \\times 4 = 120$\n\nFinally, substitute these values back into the probability expression:\n\n$P(X=2) = \\frac{10 \\times 5}{120} = \\frac{50}{120}$\n\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final result:\n\n$P(X=2) = \\frac{5}{12}$",

This practice problem illustrates the concept of variable transformation, a common technique in regression to better capture the underlying data structure.
