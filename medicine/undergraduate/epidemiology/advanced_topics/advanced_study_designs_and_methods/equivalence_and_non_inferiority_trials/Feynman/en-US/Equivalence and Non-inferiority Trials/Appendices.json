This approach assesses whether a new treatment is 'not unacceptably worse' by determining if the CI for the treatment difference lies on the acceptable side of a pre-defined non-inferiority margin, $\\Delta$. This practice provides a direct application of this core principle, challenging you to perform the fundamental calculation for assessing non-inferiority. ",

Let the risk difference be defined as $\\Delta = p_{\\text{new}} - p_{\\text{standard}}$, where larger $\\Delta$ indicates a higher response rate with the new agent. Investigators prespecified an equivalence margin $\\delta = 0.10$ (ten percentage points). At significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, they performed a superiority analysis and also assessed equivalence using the Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) framework. The estimated difference produced a 95% confidence interval $[-0.14, 0.18]$ and a 90% confidence interval $[-0.12, 0.16]$.

            "solution": "The problem requires interpreting confidence intervals to distinguish between the outcomes of a superiority test and an equivalence test.\n\n**1.

Failure to show superiority means we fail to reject $H_{0, \\text{sup}}$.\n*   **Equivalence Test (TOST):** Aims to prove the new agent is clinically similar to the standard, i.e., $-\\delta  \\Delta  \\delta$. The null hypothesis is that they are not equivalent: $H_{0, \\text{eq}}: \\Delta \\le -\\delta \\text{ or } \\Delta \\ge \\delta$.\n\n**2. Link to Confidence Intervals**\n\nThe Two One-Sided Tests (TOST) procedure at significance level $\\alpha$ is equivalent to checking if the $(1-2\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\Delta$ is entirely contained within the equivalence margin $(-\\delta, \\delta)$.\n- Given $\\alpha = 0.05$, the required confidence interval is the $(1 - 2 \\times 0.05) = 90\\%$ CI.\n- The equivalence margin is $\\delta = 0.10$, so the equivalence region is $(-0.10, 0.10)$.\n\n**3. Apply to the Data**\n\n- The provided 90% CI for $\\Delta$ is $[-0.12, 0.16]$.\n- To check for equivalence, we compare this CI to the region $(-0.10, 0.10)$.\n  - The lower bound of the CI, $-0.12$, is *not* greater than $-0.10$.\n  - The upper bound of the CI, $0.16$, is *not* less than $0.10$.\n- Since the 90% CI is not fully contained within $(-0.10, 0.10)$, we fail to reject $H_{0, \\text{eq}}$. Equivalence is **not** established.\n\nThe problem states superiority was not demonstrated. This is consistent with the CI, as the lower bound of the 90% CI ($-0.12$) is not greater than $0$.\nThe study is therefore inconclusive: it failed to show superiority and also failed to show equivalence. This happens because the CI is too wide, reflecting insufficient precision.\n\n**4. Evaluate the Options**\n\n*   **A:** Correctly states the hypotheses for superiority and equivalence, correctly uses the 90% CI for TOST at $\\alpha=0.05$, and correctly concludes that equivalence is not established because the CI $[-0.12, 0.16]$ is not contained within $(-0.10, 0.10)$. This option accurately describes the situation.\n*   **B:** Incorrectly equates \"CI includes 0\" with equivalence.\n*   **C:** Incorrectly refers to the 95% CI for the TOST procedure and incorrectly suggests a wide interval helps establish equivalence.\n*   **D:** Makes several false claims about the relationship between superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence.\n\nThus, option A provides the correct explanation.",

Therefore, the ITT analysis demonstrates non-inferiority.\n\n**3. Comparison and Option Evaluation**\n\n- **Dilution Effect:** The PP risk difference is $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}} = -0.09$. The ITT risk difference is $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.054$. Since $|\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}|  |\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}|$, the symmetric cross-over has diluted the observed effect estimate towards the null value of $0$.\n- **Effect on Conclusion:** The PP analysis failed to show non-inferiority, while the ITT analysis succeeded. In this scenario, using the ITT principle favors the conclusion of non-inferiority compared to using the PP principle.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under symmetric 20% cross-over, the ITT estimate is diluted toward $0$ compared with the PP effect; with $n=500$ per arm and $M=-0.10$, the ITT $95\\%$ confidence interval lies entirely above $-0.10$ while the PP $95\\%$ confidence interval does not, so ITT favors concluding non-inferiority relative to PP.**\n- This statement accurately summarizes the derived results. The ITT estimate ($-0.054$) is indeed diluted toward $0$ compared to the PP estimate ($-0.09$). The ITT CI lower bound ($-0.09875$) is above $-0.10$, while the PP CI lower bound ($-0.13976$) is not. Consequently, the ITT analysis leads to a non-inferiority conclusion where the PP analysis does not.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under symmetric 20% cross-over, the ITT estimate exaggerates differences away from $0$ and is less likely than PP to conclude non-inferiority.**\n- The ITT estimate of the difference, $\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}}=-0.054$, is smaller in magnitude than the PP estimate, $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}}=-0.09$. Thus, it represents a dilution toward $0$, not an exaggeration. In this specific case, it was more likely, not less likely, to conclude non-inferiority.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. With 20% non-adherence in both arms, ITT and PP produce identical risk differences and confidence intervals, so non-inferiority conclusions are unaffected.**\n- The calculations clearly show that the risk differences ($\\Delta_{\\text{ITT}} = -0.054$ vs. $\\Delta_{\\text{PP}} = -0.09$) and the confidence intervals ($CI_{\\text{ITT}} \\approx [-0.099, -0.009]$ vs. $CI_{\\text{PP}} \\approx [-0.140, -0.040]$) are not identical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Because non-inferiority trials must always prefer ITT for conservatism, the ITT analysis is the only valid basis for concluding non-inferiority even if PP fails.**\n- This statement contains a critical flaw in reasoning. In superiority trials, ITT is generally conservative because dilution biases the effect toward the null, making it harder to show a difference. However, in non-inferiority trials, this same dilution toward the null can be *anti-conservative*, making it easier to claim that a new, inferior treatment is non-inferior (as demonstrated in this problem). For this reason, regulatory bodies often require that non-inferiority be demonstrated in both the ITT and PP populations to ensure a robust conclusion. The premise that ITT is \"always\" preferred for \"conservatism\" in non-inferiority trials is false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
