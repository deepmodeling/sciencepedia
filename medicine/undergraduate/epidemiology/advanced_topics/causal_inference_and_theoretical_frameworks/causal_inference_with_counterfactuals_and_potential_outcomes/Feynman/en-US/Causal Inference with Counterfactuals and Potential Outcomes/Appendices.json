Let $Y^1$ and $Y^0$ denote the potential outcomes under treatment and no treatment, respectively, and assume the following core definitions hold throughout the study: consistency ($Y = Y^A$), exchangeability ($Y^a \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A$ for $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$), conditional exchangeability ($Y^a \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A \\mid X$ for $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$), and positivity ($0  P(A=a \\mid X=x)$ for all $x$ with $P(X=x) > 0$). The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is defined as $E(Y^1) - E(Y^0)$.\n\nSuppose the following data-generating mechanism holds:\n- $P(X=1) = 0.5$ and $P(X=0) = 0.5$.\n- $P(A=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.8$ and $P(A=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.2$.\n- $E(Y^1 \\mid X=1) = 0.9$, $E(Y^1 \\mid X=0) = 0.5$; $E(Y^0 \\mid X=1) = 0.7$, $E(Y^0 \\mid X=0) = 0.2$.\n\nAssume that treatment assignment depends on $X$ but, given $X$, is otherwise unrelated to the potential outcomes, and that all modeling assumptions are scientifically plausible in an epidemiologic setting.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and the given probabilities, evaluate which statements below are correct:\n\nA. Because consistency and positivity hold, the unadjusted difference in observed means $E(Y \\mid A=1) - E(Y \\mid A=0)$ identifies $E(Y^1) - E(Y^0)$, so unconditional exchangeability is not required. \n\nB. Unconditional exchangeability fails in this setting because $E(Y^1 \\mid A=1) \\neq E(Y^1)$, specifically $E(Y^1 \\mid A=1) = 0.82$ while $E(Y^1) = 0.7$.

Within levels of $X$, the difference in observed outcomes between $A=1$ and $A=0$ equals the causal effect in that stratum, and averaging these stratum-specific causal effects by $P(X=x)$ yields the true Average Treatment Effect.\n\nSelect all that apply.",
            "solution": "This problem requires us to distinguish the true Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from the unadjusted associational difference and to verify how adjustment for a confounder, $X$, allows us to recover the ATE.\n\n### 1. Calculate the True Average Treatment Effect (ATE)\n\nThe ATE is $E(Y^1) - E(Y^0)$. Since conditional exchangeability holds, we can identify these marginal expectations by standardizing over the distribution of the confounder $X$.\nThe formula for standardization is $E(Y^a) = \\sum_{x} E(Y^a \\mid X=x) P(X=x)$.\n\nFor $Y^1$:\n$$ E(Y^1) = E(Y^1 \\mid X=1)P(X=1) + E(Y^1 \\mid X=0)P(X=0) $$\n$$ E(Y^1) = (0.9)(0.5) + (0.5)(0.5) = 0.45 + 0.25 = 0.70 $$\n\nFor $Y^0$:\n$$ E(Y^0) = E(Y^0 \\mid X=1)P(X=1) + E(Y^0 \\mid X=0)P(X=0) $$\n$$ E(Y^0) = (0.7)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.35 + 0.10 = 0.45 $$\n\nThe true ATE is:\n$$ \\text{ATE} = E(Y^1) - E(Y^0) = 0.70 - 0.45 = 0.25 $$\n\n### 2. Calculate the Unadjusted Associational Difference\n\nThis is the \"crude\" difference: $E(Y \\mid A=1) - E(Y \\mid A=0)$. To calculate this, we first need to find the composition of the treated and untreated groups using Bayes' rule.\n\nFirst, find the marginal probability of treatment, $P(A=1)$:\n$P(A=1) = P(A=1 \\mid X=1)P(X=1) + P(A=1 \\mid X=0)P(X=0) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5$.\nSo, $P(A=0) = 0.5$.\n\nNext, find the proportion of each stratum of $X$ within each treatment group:\n$P(X=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{P(A=1 \\mid X=1) P(X=1)}{P(A=1)} = \\frac{(0.8)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.8$. Thus, $P(X=0 \\mid A=1) = 0.2$.\n$P(X=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{P(A=0 \\mid X=1) P(X=1)}{P(A=0)} = \\frac{(0.2)(0.5)}{0.5} = 0.2$. Thus, $P(X=0 \\mid A=0) = 0.8$.\n\nNow, calculate the observed mean outcomes in each treatment group using the law of total expectation:\n$E(Y \\mid A=1) = E(Y \\mid A=1, X=1)P(X=1 \\mid A=1) + E(Y \\mid A=1, X=0)P(X=0 \\mid A=1)$.\nUnder consistency and conditional exchangeability, $E(Y \\mid A=1, X=x) = E(Y^1 \\mid X=x)$.\n$E(Y \\mid A=1) = (0.9)(0.8) + (0.5)(0.2) = 0.72 + 0.10 = 0.82$.\n\n$E(Y \\mid A=0) = E(Y \\mid A=0, X=1)P(X=1 \\mid A=0) + E(Y \\mid A=0, X=0)P(X=0 \\mid A=0)$.\nUnder consistency and conditional exchangeability, $E(Y \\mid A=0, X=x) = E(Y^0 \\mid X=x)$.\n$E(Y \\mid A=0) = (0.7)(0.2) + (0.2)(0.8) = 0.14 + 0.16 = 0.30$.\n\nThe unadjusted associational difference is $0.82 - 0.30 = 0.52$.\n\n### 3. Evaluate the Options\n\n**A:** Incorrect. The unadjusted difference ($0.52$) does not equal the ATE ($0.25$). This is because unconditional exchangeability fails due to confounding by $X$.\n**B:** Correct. This statement correctly identifies that unconditional exchangeability fails by showing $E(Y^1 \\mid A=1) \\neq E(Y^1)$. Our calculation for $E(Y \\mid A=1)$ is $0.82$. Since consistency holds for the treated, $E(Y|A=1) = E(Y^1|A=1)$, so $E(Y^1|A=1)=0.82$. This is not equal to $E(Y^1)=0.7$. The statement also correctly reports the standardized means and the resulting ATE of $0.25$.\n**C:** Incorrect. $X$ is a baseline variable measured before treatment, making it a common cause of $A$ and $Y$ (a confounder), not a collider. Adjusting for a confounder is the correct procedure to remove bias.\n**D:** Incorrect. The given probabilities are $P(A=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.8$, $P(A=0 \\mid X=1) = 0.2$, $P(A=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.2$, and $P(A=0 \\mid X=0) = 0.8$. All are greater than 0, so positivity holds.\n**E:** Correct. This statement accurately describes identification by stratification. The first part, \"the difference in observed outcomes... equals the causal effect in that stratum,\" is true due to conditional exchangeability. The second part, \"averaging these stratum-specific causal effects by $P(X=x)$ yields the true Average Treatment Effect,\" is the definition of standardization. Our calculation confirms this: $[(0.9-0.7) \\times 0.5] + [(0.5-0.2) \\times 0.5] = [0.2 \\times 0.5] + [0.3 \\times 0.5] = 0.1 + 0.15 = 0.25$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks to frame the observation of potential outcomes as a missing data problem and classify the missingness mechanism under the given assumptions.\n\nFirst, we formalize the missing data setup. For each individual, the \"complete data\" can be thought of as the pair of potential outcomes $(Y(0), Y(1))$ and covariates $X$. The observed outcome $Y$ is determined by the treatment received, $A$, according to the consistency assumption $Y = Y(A)$. This means:\n- If an individual receives treatment $A=1$, we observe $Y(1)$, and $Y(0)$ is missing.\n- If an individual receives treatment $A=0$, we observe $Y(0)$, and $Y(1)$ is missing.\n\nThe observation indicator for a potential outcome $Y(a)$, denoted $R_a$, is thus defined by the treatment assignment. $Y(a)$ is observed if and only if the individual received treatment $a$. Therefore, the indicator is correctly defined as $R_a = \\mathbb{I}(A=a)$, where $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n\nNext, we classify the missingness mechanism based on the relationship between the probability of observation and the data. The standard definitions are:\n- **Missing Completely At Random (MCAR):** The probability of missingness is independent of all data, observed or unobserved. Formally, $\\Pr(R_a = 1 \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X)$ is constant.\n- **Missing At Random (MAR):** The probability of missingness is independent of the unobserved data, conditional on the observed data. For the missingness of $Y(a)$, this means the probability of observing $Y(a)$ can depend on observed variables like $X$, but not on the value of $Y(a)$ itself.\n- **Missing Not At Random (MNAR):** The probability of missingness depends on the unobserved data, even after conditioning on observed data.\n\nLet's evaluate the probability of observing $Y(a)$ under the assumption of **conditional exchangeability**, $(Y(0), Y(1)) \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A \\mid X$.\nThe event $\\{R_a=1\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{A=a\\}$. We are examining the probability $\\Pr(A=a \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X)$.\n$$ \\Pr(R_a = 1 \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X) = \\Pr(A=a \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X) $$\nBy conditional exchangeability, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Pr(A=a \\mid X) $$\nThis resulting probability depends on the covariate vector $X$ (which is fully observed) but does not depend on the potential outcomes $Y(0)$ or $Y(1)$. This fits the definition of **Missing At Random (MAR)**, where the missingness for $Y(a)$ is conditional on the observed variable $X$.\n\nNow, let's consider the special case of a **completely randomized trial**. Here, treatment assignment $A$ is independent of all pre-treatment variables, both measured ($X$) and unmeasured (the potential outcomes $Y(0), Y(1)$). This corresponds to the stronger assumption of unconditional exchangeability: $(X, Y(0), Y(1)) \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp A$.\nUnder this assumption:\n$$ \\Pr(R_a = 1 \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X) = \\Pr(A=a \\mid Y(0), Y(1), X) = \\Pr(A=a) $$\nThe probability of observing $Y(a)$ is a constant, which does not depend on $X$ or the potential outcomes. This is the definition of **MCAR**.\n\nWith this derivation, we can evaluate the options:\n- **A:** Correctly defines $R_a = \\mathbb{I}(A=a)$, correctly classifies the observational study case as MAR given $X$ under conditional exchangeability, and correctly classifies the randomized trial case as MCAR. This aligns perfectly with our derivation.\n- **B:** Incorrectly classifies the mechanism as MNAR. Conditional exchangeability is precisely the assumption that ensures the missingness is MAR (given $X$), not MNAR.\n- **C:** Incorrectly claims the mechanism is MCAR in any observational study and incorrectly claims that positivity implies randomization. Positivity ensures overlap, but not random assignment.\n- **D:** Uses a nonsensical definition for the observation indicator, $R_a = \\mathbb{I}(Y=a)$. The indicator for observing $Y(a)$ depends on treatment assignment $A$, not the outcome $Y$.\n\nTherefore, option A is the only one that correctly frames the problem and accurately classifies the missingness mechanisms under the specified conditions.",

By SUTVA, the observed outcome $Y$ is always determined by the *true* exposure, so $Y = Y(A)$. If an individual is misclassified ($A \\neq A^\\ast$), the analyst's assumed consistency relation $Y=Y(A^\\ast)$ would only hold if $Y(A) = Y(A^\\ast)$. This is not guaranteed. For example, consider a \"responder\" individual for whom $(Y(1),Y(0))=(0,1)$. If their true exposure is $A=0$ but they are misclassified as $A^\\ast=1$, their observed outcome is $Y=Y(0)=1$. The analyst, using $A^\\ast$, would expect the outcome to be $Y(A^\\ast)=Y(1)=0$. Since $1 \\neq 0$, the consistency relation based on the mismeasured exposure fails. This happens for any individual with $Y(0) \\neq Y(1)$ who is misclassified. Therefore, the statement is **correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C:**\nThis statement presents a hypothetical case. If sensitivity and specificity were both 1, then $\\Pr(A^\\ast=1|A=1)=1$ and $\\Pr(A^\\ast=0|A=0)=1$. This implies $\\Pr(A^\\ast \\neq A) = 0$, so $A^\\ast = A$ almost surely. The true consistency relation from SUTVA is $Y=Y(A)$. Since $A^\\ast$ is identical to $A$, we can substitute it directly, yielding $Y=Y(A^\\ast)$. Thus, the consistency relation for the proxy would hold. The statement is **correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B:**\nThis statement claims that because the error is nondifferential, the causal effect estimate using $A^\\ast$ is unbiased. This is generally false; nondifferential misclassification of a binary exposure typically biases the association towards the null. Let's calculate and verify.\n- **True Average Treatment Effect (ATE):**\n  ATE $= E[Y(1)-Y(0)] = 0.4 \\times (Y(1)-Y(0))_{\\text{responder}} + 0.6 \\times (Y(1)-Y(0))_{\\text{non-case}}$\n  ATE $= 0.4 \\times (0-1) + 0.6 \\times (0-0) = -0.4$.\n- **Naive Associational \"Effect\":**\n  We need to calculate $E[Y|A^\\ast=1] - E[Y|A^\\ast=0] = \\Pr(Y=1|A^\\ast=1) - \\Pr(Y=1|A^\\ast=0)$.\n  An outcome of $Y=1$ occurs only for responders with true exposure $A=0$.\n  $\\Pr(Y=1) = \\Pr(Y=1|A=0) \\Pr(A=0) = \\Pr(Y(0)=1)\\Pr(A=0)$.\n  $\\Pr(Y(0)=1) = \\Pr(\\text{responder}) = 0.4$. So, $\\Pr(Y=1) = 0.4 \\times 0.5 = 0.2$.\n  Now, let's find the joint probabilities using the law of total probability, conditioning on $A$:\n  $\\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1) = \\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1|A=0)\\Pr(A=0) + \\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1|A=1)\\Pr(A=1)$.\n  The second term is 0, since $Y=1$ only if $A=0$.\n  $\\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1) = \\Pr(Y=1|A=0)\\Pr(A^\\ast=1|A=0)\\Pr(A=0)$ (using nondifferential error and exchangeability).\n  $\\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1) = (0.4) \\times (1-0.8) \\times (0.5) = 0.4 \\times 0.2 \\times 0.5 = 0.04$.\n  We also need $\\Pr(A^\\ast=1) = \\Pr(A^\\ast=1|A=1)\\Pr(A=1) + \\Pr(A^\\ast=1|A=0)\\Pr(A=0) = (0.8)(0.5) + (0.2)(0.5) = 0.4 + 0.1 = 0.5$.\n  So, $\\Pr(Y=1|A^\\ast=1) = \\frac{\\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1)}{\\Pr(A^\\ast=1)} = \\frac{0.04}{0.5} = 0.08$.\n  Similarly, $\\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=0) = \\Pr(Y=1) - \\Pr(Y=1, A^\\ast=1) = 0.2 - 0.04 = 0.16$.\n  $\\Pr(A^\\ast=0) = 1 - \\Pr(A^\\ast=1) = 0.5$.\n  So, $\\Pr(Y=1|A^\\ast=0) = \\frac{0.16}{0.5} = 0.32$.\n  The naive estimate is $0.08 - 0.32 = -0.24$.\n  Since $-0.24 \\neq -0.4$, the estimate is biased. The statement is **incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D:**\nThis statement claims the ATE is identified from the joint distribution of $(Y, A^\\ast)$ alone, without further assumptions. To identify a causal effect, two steps are needed: 1) relate the observed data to the distribution under the true exposure (e.g., correct for measurement error to find $\\Pr(Y|A)$), and 2) relate this associational measure to a causal effect, which requires an untestable causal assumption like exchangeability ($A \\perp\\!\\!\\!\\perp (Y(1),Y(0))$). The statement explicitly forbids using this crucial assumption (\"without any further assumptions...\"). Without exchangeability, one cannot equate an associational measure with the causal ATE. Therefore, identification is impossible from the observables alone under these constraints. The statement is **incorrect**.\n\nThe correct options are A and C.",
