            "problem": "A hospital quality assessment study seeks to compare hospital-level mortality while accounting for differences in patient case-mix. In epidemiology, stratification and standardization are used to control for confounding by variables such as severity. Begin from the fundamental definitions: a stratum-specific mortality rate is defined as $r_{i} = \\frac{d_{i}}{n_{i}}$, where $d_{i}$ is the number of deaths and $n_{i}$ is the number of individuals at risk (for example, admissions) in stratum $i$. In direct standardization, the goal is to estimate a mortality rate that would apply to a common reference population by weighting the hospital’s stratum-specific rates by a fixed set of stratum weights from a standard population. In indirect standardization, the goal is to compare the observed number of deaths in the hospital to the number expected if the hospital had experienced the stratum-specific rates from a standard (reference) population; expected deaths are obtained by applying the standard stratum-specific rates to the hospital’s stratum-specific counts.\n\nConsider Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ with $3$ severity strata defined by a validated risk score. Over a fixed $30$-day in-hospital follow-up window, the following data are observed:\n\n- Stratum $1$: hospital admissions $n_{1} = 1500$, observed deaths $d_{1} = 12$; standard (reference) mortality rate $r^{\\text{std}}_{1} = 0.010$.\n- Stratum $2$: hospital admissions $n_{2} = 900$, observed deaths $d_{2} = 35$; standard (reference) mortality rate $r^{\\text{std}}_{2} = 0.030$.\n- Stratum $3$: hospital admissions $n_{3} = 150$, observed deaths $d_{3} = 36$; standard (reference) mortality rate $r^{\\text{std}}_{3} = 0.120$.\n\nUsing only the above fundamental definitions, first justify the conceptual distinction between direct and indirect standardization in terms of which rates and which weights are applied. Then, derive from first principles an analytic expression for the standardized mortality ratio (Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)) as the ratio of total observed deaths to total expected deaths under indirect standardization. Finally, compute Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$’s SMR using the data provided. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final result as a unitless decimal.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario in epidemiology and health services research, providing all necessary data and definitions for a complete and unambiguous solution. The data are internally consistent and plausible within the given context. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, a conceptual justification of the distinction between direct and indirect standardization; second, a derivation of the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) from first principles; and third, the computation of the SMR for Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$.\n\n### 1. Conceptual Distinction Between Direct and Indirect Standardization\n\nThe core objective of standardization is to enable a fair comparison of rates (e.g., mortality rates) between different populations by adjusting for differences in the distribution of one or more confounding variables, such as age, sex, or, in this case, disease severity. The distinction between direct and indirect standardization lies in the reference point and the components used for adjustment.\n\nLet there be $I$ strata, indexed by $i=1, \\dots, I$. For a study population (e.g., Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$), let $d_i$ be the number of events (deaths) and $n_i$ be the population size in stratum $i$. The stratum-specific rate is $r_i = d_i / n_i$. For a standard population, let $r^{\\text{std}}_i$ be the stratum-specific rate and $N^{\\text{std}}_i$ be the population size in stratum $i$.\n\n**Direct Standardization:**\nDirect standardization calculates an overall rate that the study population would have if it had the same population structure as the standard population. It applies the study population's stratum-specific rates ($r_i$) to the standard population's stratum-specific weights. The weight for stratum $i$, $w^{\\text{std}}_i$, is its proportion in the standard population, $w^{\\text{std}}_i = N^{\\text{std}}_i / \\sum_{k=1}^{I} N^{\\text{std}}_k$. The Directly Standardized Rate (DSR) is a weighted average of the study population's rates:\n$$\n\\text{DSR} = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} w^{\\text{std}}_i r_i\n$$\nThe DSR is an adjusted rate and has units of rate (e.g., deaths per person-time). It answers the counterfactual question: \"What would the mortality rate of Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ be if its patient mix were identical to that of the standard population?\" This method requires that the stratum-specific rates ($r_i$) in the study population are stable (i.e., not based on very small numbers of deaths or individuals).\n\n**Indirect Standardization:**\nIndirect standardization calculates the ratio of observed events to expected events. It applies the standard population's stratum-specific rates ($r^{\\text{std}}_i$) to the study population's stratum-specific sizes ($n_i$) to calculate the number of \"expected\" events. The total observed events are $O = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} d_i$. The total expected events are $E = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} n_i r^{\\text{std}}_i$. The resulting measure is the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), a unitless ratio:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} d_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} n_i r^{\\text{std}}_i}\n$$\nThe SMR answers the counterfactual question: \"How does the number of observed deaths in Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ compare to the number that would be expected if its patients had experienced the mortality rates of the standard population, given Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$'s actual patient mix?\" An SMR greater than $1$ indicates higher mortality than expected, while an SMR less than $1$ indicates lower mortality than expected. This method is preferred when stratum-specific rates in the study population are unstable or unavailable.\n\n**In summary:** The conceptual distinction is which components are from the study versus the standard population. Direct standardization applies **local rates** to a **standard population structure (weights)**. Indirect standardization applies **standard rates** to a **local population structure (counts)**.\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)\n\nThe SMR is derived from the principles of indirect standardization. The goal is to compare the observed mortality in a specific population (Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$) to the mortality that would be expected if that population were subject to the mortality rates of a standard reference population.\n\n**Step 1: Define Total Observed Deaths ($O$)**\nThe total number of observed deaths in Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ is the sum of deaths across all $I$ strata. Let $d_i$ be the observed number of deaths in stratum $i$.\n$$\nO = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} d_i\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Define Total Expected Deaths ($E$)**\nThe number of expected deaths is a hypothetical quantity. It is the number of deaths that would have occurred in Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ if its patients in each stratum had died at the same rate as the patients in the corresponding stratum of the standard population.\nLet $n_i$ be the number of individuals (admissions) in stratum $i$ in Hospital $\\mathcalH$.\nLet $r^{\\text{std}}_i$ be the mortality rate in stratum $i$ of the standard population.\nThe expected number of deaths in stratum $i$, denoted $e_i$, is the product of the number of individuals in that stratum and the standard rate for that stratum:\n$$\ne_i = n_i \\times r^{\\text{std}}_i\n$$\nThe total number of expected deaths, $E$, is the sum of the expected deaths across all strata:\n$$\nE = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} e_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{I} (n_i r^{\\text{std}}_i)\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Define the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)**\nThe SMR is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed deaths to the total number of expected deaths.\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{\\text{Total Observed Deaths}}{\\text{Total Expected Deaths}} = \\frac{O}{E}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $O$ and $E$ gives the final analytic expression for the SMR:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} d_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{I} n_i r^{\\text{std}}_i}\n$$\nThis expression is the required derivation from first principles.\n\n### 3. Computation of SMR for Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$\n\nThe problem provides data for Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ across $I=3$ severity strata.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- Stratum $1$: $n_{1} = 1500$, $d_{1} = 12$, $r^{\\text{std}}_{1} = 0.010$\n- Stratum $2$: $n_{2} = 900$, $d_{2} = 35$, $r^{\\text{std}}_{2} = 0.030$\n- Stratum $3$: $n_{3} = 150$, $d_{3} = 36$, $r^{\\text{std}}_{3} = 0.120$\n\n**Step A: Calculate Total Observed Deaths ($O$)**\nThe total observed deaths are the sum of deaths in each stratum.\n$$\nO = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 12 + 35 + 36 = 83\n$$\n\n**Step B: Calculate Total Expected Deaths ($E$)**\nThe total expected deaths are calculated by applying the standard rates to the hospital's patient counts in each stratum and summing the results.\n- Expected deaths in Stratum $1$: $e_1 = n_1 \\times r^{\\text{std}}_1 = 1500 \\times 0.010 = 15$\n- Expected deaths in Stratum $2$: $e_2 = n_2 \\times r^{\\text{std}}_2 = 900 \\times 0.030 = 27$\n- Expected deaths in Stratum $3$: $e_3 = n_3 \\times r^{\\text{std}}_3 = 150 \\times 0.120 = 18$\n\nThe total expected deaths are:\n$$\nE = e_1 + e_2 + e_3 = 15 + 27 + 18 = 60\n$$\n\n**Step C: Calculate the SMR**\nUsing the derived formula and the calculated values for $O$ and $E$:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E} = \\frac{83}{60}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = 1.383333\\dots\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $3$, $8$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, so we do not round up.\n$$\n\\text{SMR} \\approx 1.383\n$$\nThis SMR value indicates that Hospital $\\mathcal{H}$ observed approximately $38.3\\%$ more deaths than would be expected if its patients experienced the mortality rates of the standard reference population, after accounting for its specific case-mix of patient severity.",

            "problem": "A health system is evaluating three mutually exclusive service delivery strategies for managing a chronic condition. For each strategy, you are given the average total cost per patient in dollars and average effectiveness per patient measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY), where Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a standard measure of health benefit combining survival and quality of life. Let the strategies be labeled $A$, $B$, and $C$. The cost and effectiveness pairs are: $A$: cost $C_A = 20{,}000$, effect $E_A = 2.0$; $B$: cost $C_B = 34{,}000$, effect $E_B = 2.3$; $C$: cost $C_C = 42{,}000$, effect $E_C = 2.7$.

            "solution": "This is a problem in cost-effectiveness analysis, a core component of health services and outcomes research. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established health economic principles, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed objectively.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts as requested.\n\n1.  Derivation of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)\n\nLet there be two mutually exclusive strategies, $S_1$ and $S_2$, with associated costs $C_1$ and $C_2$, and health effects $E_1$ and $E_2$, respectively. Assume, without loss of generality, that strategy $S_2$ is more effective than strategy $S_1$, i.e., $E_2 > E_1$. For $S_2$ to be a considerable alternative to $S_1$, it must also be more costly, i.e., $C_2 > C_1$. If it were less costly ($C_2 < C_1$), strategy $S_1$ would be strictly dominated and would be discarded.\n\nThe incremental cost of choosing $S_2$ over $S_1$ is defined as the difference in their costs:\n$$ \\Delta C = C_2 - C_1 $$\n\nThe incremental effect of choosing $S_2$ over $S_1$ is defined as the difference in their effects:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_2 - E_1 $$\n\nThe incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is defined as the ratio of the incremental cost to the incremental effect:\n$$ ICER_{S_2 \\text{ vs } S_1} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta E} = \\frac{C_2 - C_1}{E_2 - E_1} $$\n\nThe units of this ratio are cost per unit of effect (e.g., dollars per QALY). Therefore, the ICER quantifies the additional cost that must be incurred to gain one additional unit of health effectiveness by adopting strategy $S_2$ instead of strategy $S_1$. It is the marginal cost of producing health with $S_2$ relative to $S_1$.\n\n2.  Assessment of Dominance and Extended Dominance\n\nThe given strategies are:\n- Strategy A: $C_A = 20{,}000$, $E_A = 2.0$\n- Strategy B: $C_B = 34{,}000$, $E_B = 2.3$\n- Strategy C: $C_C = 42{,}000$, $E_C = 2.7$\n\nFirst, we order the strategies by increasing effectiveness: $A \\rightarrow B \\rightarrow C$. The costs are also increasing along this order: $C_A < C_B < C_C$.\n\nA strategy $S_i$ is strictly dominated if there exists another strategy $S_j$ that is both more effective ($E_j > E_i$) and less costly ($C_j < C_i$). In this dataset, no strategy is more effective and simultaneously less costly than another. Therefore, no strategy is strictly dominated.\n\nA strategy is ruled out by extended dominance if it is part of a sequence of strategies ordered by effectiveness, but its ICER relative to the preceding strategy is greater than the ICER of a subsequent, more effective strategy. This implies that the strategy lies above the cost-effectiveness frontier formed by other strategies. To check this, we calculate the sequential ICERs.\n\nThe ICER for moving from strategy $A$ to strategy $B$ is:\n$$ ICER_{B \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{C_B - C_A}{E_B - E_A} = \\frac{34{,}000 - 20{,}000}{2.3 - 2.0} = \\frac{14{,}000}{0.3} = \\frac{140{,}000}{3} \\approx 46{,}666.67 \\text{ dollars/QALY} $$\n\nThe ICER for moving from strategy $B$ to strategy $C$ is:\n$$ ICER_{C \\text{ vs } B} = \\frac{C_C - C_B}{E_C - E_B} = \\frac{42{,}000 - 34{,}000}{2.7 - 2.3} = \\frac{8{,}000}{0.4} = 20{,}000 \\text{ dollars/QALY} $$\n\nWe observe that $ICER_{B \\text{ vs } A} > ICER_{C \\text{ vs } B}$. This condition indicates that strategy $B$ is subject to extended dominance. The cost per additional QALY is higher to switch from $A$ to $B$ than it is to switch from $B$ to $C$. This means that strategy $B$ is inefficient relative to a combination of strategies $A$ and $C$. The cost-effectiveness frontier is the convex hull of the points in the cost-effectiveness plane, and strategy $B$ lies above the line segment connecting strategies $A$ and $C$.\n\nTherefore, strategy $B$ should be excluded from consideration. The efficient set of strategies, which form the cost-effectiveness frontier, consists of only $A$ and $C$.\n\n3.  Derivation of the Decision Rule based on Willingness-to-Pay\n\nThe willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold, denoted by $\\lambda$, represents the maximum price a decision-maker is willing to pay for an additional unit of health effect (e.g., a QALY).\n\nThe optimal strategy is the one that maximizes the net value. A common metric for this is the Net Monetary Benefit (NMB), which converts health effects into monetary units using the WTP threshold $\\lambda$. For a strategy $S_i$ with cost $C_i$ and effect $E_i$, the NMB is:\n$$ NMB_i = (\\lambda \\times E_i) - C_i $$\nThe term $\\lambda \\times E_i$ represents the value of the health outcome in monetary terms.\n\nTo choose between two non-dominated strategies, $S_i$ and a more effective and more costly strategy $S_j$ ($E_j > E_i$, $C_j > C_i$), we should adopt $S_j$ if its NMB is greater than the NMB of $S_i$:\n$$ NMB_j > NMB_i $$\n$$ (\\lambda \\times E_j) - C_j > (\\lambda \\times E_i) - C_i $$\nRearranging the terms to isolate $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda \\times E_j - \\lambda \\times E_i > C_j - C_i $$\n$$ \\lambda (E_j - E_i) > C_j - C_i $$\nSince $E_j > E_i$, the term $(E_j - E_i)$ is positive, so we can divide by it without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$ \\lambda > \\frac{C_j - C_i}{E_j - E_i} $$\nThe right-hand side of the inequality is the definition of the ICER of $S_j$ versus $S_i$. Thus, the decision rule is: Choose the more costly and more effective strategy $S_j$ over $S_i$ if the willingness-to-pay threshold $\\lambda$ is greater than the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between them.\n\nThis rule is applied incrementally along the cost-effectiveness frontier. Starting with the least costly option ($A$), one considers moving to the next option on the frontier ($C$). This move is justified if $\\lambda > ICER_{C \\text{ vs } A}$. If $\\lambda < ICER_{C \\text{ vs } A}$, the additional cost is not justified by the willingness-to-pay, and the less costly strategy ($A$) remains the optimal choice.\n\n4.  Calculation of the Critical Willingness-to-Pay Threshold $\\lambda^*$\n\nThe critical willingness-to-pay threshold, $\\lambda^*$, is the specific value of $\\lambda$ at which a decision-maker is indifferent between two adjacent strategies on the efficient frontier. This occurs when their Net Monetary Benefits are equal.\n$$ NMB_j = NMB_i $$\nBased on the derivation in part $3$, this equality holds when:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{C_j - C_i}{E_j - E_i} = ICER_{j \\text{ vs } i} $$\n\nAfter eliminating strategy $B$ due to extended dominance, the remaining strategies on the efficient frontier are $A$ and $C$. There is only one incremental step on this frontier: from $A$ to $C$. Therefore, there is a single critical threshold $\\lambda^*$ that determines the switch from preferring $A$ to preferring $C$. This threshold is the ICER of strategy $C$ versus strategy $A$.\n\n$$ \\lambda^* = ICER_{C \\text{ vs } A} = \\frac{C_C - C_A}{E_C - E_A} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\lambda^* = \\frac{42{,}000 - 20{,}000}{2.7 - 2.0} = \\frac{22{,}000}{0.7} $$\n\nTo express this as an exact value, we write the denominator as a fraction:\n$$ \\lambda^* = \\frac{22{,}000}{\\frac{7}{10}} = 22{,}000 \\times \\frac{10}{7} = \\frac{220{,}000}{7} $$\n\nThis is the exact value of the critical WTP threshold in dollars per QALY. If the societal WTP for a QALY is less than this value, strategy $A$ is optimal. If it is greater than this value, strategy $C$ is optimal.",

From these, we can calculate the corrected risk difference. The relationship between the observed counts ($n_{t^*y}^*$) and the true counts ($n_{ty}$) is governed by the misclassification parameters, sensitivity ($Se$) and specificity ($Sp$).\n\nThe assumption of nondifferential misclassification implies that the probabilities of misclassification are independent of the outcome $Y$. This allows us to work separately within each stratum of the outcome $Y$.\n\nLet's establish the system of linear equations that relates the observed counts to the true counts for a given outcome level $j \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\nThe number of individuals observed with $T^*=1$ and $Y=j$ is the sum of true positives (correctly classified treated individuals) and false positives (incorrectly classified untreated individuals):\n$$ n_{1j}^* = n_{1j} \\cdot P(T^*=1 \\mid T=1) + n_{0j} \\cdot P(T^*=1 \\mid T=0) $$\nUsing the definitions of $Se$ and $Sp$:\n$$ n_{1j}^* = n_{1j} \\cdot Se + n_{0j} \\cdot (1-Sp) $$\nSimilarly, the number of individuals observed with $T^*=0$ and $Y=j$ is the sum of true negatives (correctly classified untreated) and false negatives (incorrectly classified treated):\n$$ n_{0j}^* = n_{0j} \\cdot P(T^*=0 \\mid T=0) + n_{1j} \\cdot P(T^*=0 \\mid T=1) $$\n$$ n_{0j}^* = n_{0j} \\cdot Sp + n_{1j} \\cdot (1-Se) $$\n\nWe can express this system in matrix form as specified in the problem. Let $\\mathbf{N}_j^* = \\begin{pmatrix} n_{0j}^* \\\\ n_{1j}^* \\end{pmatrix}$ be the vector of observed counts and $\\mathbf{N}_j = \\begin{pmatrix} n_{0j} \\\\ n_{1j} \\end{pmatrix}$ be the vector of true counts for outcome stratum $Y=j$. The relationship is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} n_{0j}^* \\\\ n_{1j}^* \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} Sp & 1-Se \\\\ 1-Sp & Se \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} n_{0j} \\\\ n_{1j} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet the misclassification matrix be $\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} Sp & 1-Se \\\\ 1-Sp & Se \\end{pmatrix}$. The equation is $\\mathbf{N}_j^* = \\mathbf{M} \\mathbf{N}_j$. To find the true counts $\\mathbf{N}_j$, we must compute the inverse of $\\mathbf{M}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{N}_j = \\mathbf{M}^{-1} \\mathbf{N}_j^* $$\nThe determinant of $\\mathbf{M}$ is $\\det(\\mathbf{M}) = (Sp)(Se) - (1-Se)(1-Sp) = Se \\cdot Sp - (1 - Sp - Se + Se \\cdot Sp) = Se + Sp - 1$.\nThe inverse matrix $\\mathbf{M}^{-1}$ is:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{Se+Sp-1} \\begin{pmatrix} Se & -(1-Se) \\\\ -(1-Sp) & Sp \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{Se+Sp-1} \\begin{pmatrix} Se & Se-1 \\\\ Sp-1 & Sp \\end{pmatrix} $$\nGiven $Se = 0.90$ and $Sp = 0.95$, we have:\n$$ Se+Sp-1 = 0.90 + 0.95 - 1 = 0.85 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{M}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.85} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.90 & 0.90-1 \\\\ 0.95-1 & 0.95 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.85} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.90 & -0.10 \\\\ -0.05 & 0.95 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow we apply this to find the true counts for each outcome stratum.\n\n**Stratum 1: Outcome $Y=1$**\nThe observed counts are $n_{01}^* = 53$ and $n_{11}^* = 137$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} n_{01} \\\\ n_{11} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.85} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.90 & -0.10 \\\\ -0.05 & 0.95 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 53 \\\\ 137 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ n_{01} = \\frac{1}{0.85} (0.90 \\times 53 - 0.10 \\times 137) = \\frac{1}{0.85} (47.7 - 13.7) = \\frac{34}{0.85} = 40 $$\n$$ n_{11} = \\frac{1}{0.85} (-0.05 \\times 53 + 0.95 \\times 137) = \\frac{1}{0.85} (-2.65 + 130.15) = \\frac{127.5}{0.85} = 150 $$\nSo, the corrected counts for $Y=1$ are $n_{01}=40$ and $n_{11}=150$.\n\n**Stratum 2: Outcome $Y=0$**\nThe observed counts are $n_{00}^* = 387$ and $n_{10}^* = 423$.\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} n_{00} \\\\ n_{10} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{0.85} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.90 & -0.10 \\\\ -0.05 & 0.95 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 387 \\\\ 423 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n$$ n_{00} = \\frac{1}{0.85} (0.90 \\times 387 - 0.10 \\times 423) = \\frac{1}{0.85} (348.3 - 42.3) = \\frac{306}{0.85} = 360 $$\n$$ n_{10} = \\frac{1}{0.85} (-0.05 \\times 387 + 0.95 \\times 423) = \\frac{1}{0.85} (-19.35 + 401.85) = \\frac{382.5}{0.85} = 450 $$\nSo, the corrected counts for $Y=0$ are $n_{00}=360$ and $n_{10}=450$.\n\n**Corrected $2 \\times 2$ Table:**\nThe table of true counts $n_{ty}$ is:\n-   $T=1, Y=1$: $n_{11} = 150$\n-   $T=1, Y=0$: $n_{10} = 450$\n-   $T=0, Y=1$: $n_{01} = 40$\n-   $T=0, Y=0$: $n_{00} = 360$\n\n**Calculate Corrected Risk Difference (RD)**\nThe total number of truly treated individuals ($T=1$) is $N_1 = n_{11} + n_{10} = 150 + 450 = 600$.\nThe total number of truly untreated individuals ($T=0$) is $N_0 = n_{01} + n_{00} = 40 + 360 = 400$.\n\nThe risk of the outcome among the truly treated is:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid T=1) = \\frac{n_{11}}{N_1} = \\frac{150}{600} = 0.25 $$\nThe risk of the outcome among the truly untreated is:\n$$ P(Y=1 \\mid T=0) = \\frac{n_{01}}{N_0} = \\frac{40}{400} = 0.10 $$\nThe corrected risk difference is:\n$$ \\text{RD} = P(Y=1 \\mid T=1) - P(Y=1 \\mid T=0) = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
