            "problem": "A health system cohort study using Electronic Health Records (EHR) investigates whether initiating a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor (Drug X) versus a non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Drug Y) affects the incidence rate of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Among new initiators, follow-up begins at treatment initiation and ends at the earliest of outcome occurrence, treatment discontinuation, switching, loss to follow-up, death, or administrative end of study. Assume independent censoring. The design includes restriction and adjustment to address measured confounding. Investigators report that the Drug X group accumulated $2600$ person-years with $52$ first-event hospitalizations, and the Drug Y group accumulated $4200$ person-years with $38$ first-event hospitalizations. Both groups contributed positive person-time and the recorded outcome is well-defined under either treatment. Starting from the definition of an incidence rate as the count of events per unit person-time within an exposure group, derive the incidence rate ratio comparing Drug X to Drug Y. Under exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding of the treatment–outcome relation given the design), positivity (non-zero probability of receiving either treatment at the levels of covariates in the study population), and consistency (each individual’s observed outcome under the treatment received equals that individual’s corresponding potential outcome), interpret this numerical ratio as an estimate of a causal effect.

It uses standard definitions and concepts such as cohort studies, person-time, incidence rates, and incidence rate ratios. The context—comparing gastrointestinal risks of a selective COX-2 inhibitor versus a non-selective NSAID—is a classic and valid topic in pharmacoepidemiology.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the requested measure ($E_X, PT_X, E_Y, PT_Y$). The question is unambiguous. The conditions under which the calculated associational measure can be interpreted as a causal effect are explicitly stated (exchangeability, positivity, consistency), which is standard practice in modern epidemiology. The data are internally consistent and plausible for an electronic health records study. There are no contradictions, no reliance on pseudoscience, and the wording is objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe fundamental quantity to be calculated is the incidence rate ($IR$), which measures the occurrence of new events in a population over a specified period of time. It is defined as the number of new events divided by the total person-time at risk.\n\nThe incidence rate for the group initiating Drug X, denoted as $IR_X$, is given by:\n$$\nIR_X = \\frac{\\text{Number of events in group X}}{\\text{Total person-time in group X}} = \\frac{E_X}{PT_X}\n$$\nUsing the provided data, we have $E_X = 52$ events and $PT_X = 2600$ person-years.\n$$\nIR_X = \\frac{52}{2600} \\text{ years}^{-1} = 0.02 \\text{ years}^{-1}\n$$\n\nSimilarly, the incidence rate for the group initiating Drug Y, denoted as $IR_Y$, is:\n$$\nIR_Y = \\frac{\\text{Number of events in group Y}}{\\text{Total person-time in group Y}} = \\frac{E_Y}{PT_Y}\n$$\nUsing the provided data, we have $E_Y = 38$ events and $PT_Y = 4200$ person-years.\n$$\nIR_Y = \\frac{38}{4200} \\text{ years}^{-1} = \\frac{19}{2100} \\text{ years}^{-1}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the incidence rate ratio ($IRR$) comparing Drug X to Drug Y. This is the ratio of the incidence rate in the Drug X group to the incidence rate in the Drug Y group.\n$$\nIRR = \\frac{IR_X}{IR_Y}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $IR_X$ and $IR_Y$:\n$$\nIRR = \\frac{E_X / PT_X}{E_Y / PT_Y} = \\frac{52 / 2600}{38 / 4200}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values to calculate the ratio:\n$$\nIRR = \\frac{0.02}{38 / 4200} = \\frac{0.02 \\times 4200}{38} = \\frac{84}{38} = \\frac{42}{19}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nIRR \\approx 2.2105263...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $2$, and $1$. The fourth significant figure is $0$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\nIRR \\approx 2.21\n$$\n\nThe problem states that this numerical ratio should be interpreted as an estimate of a causal effect. This interpretation is contingent upon the stated assumptions:\n1.  **Exchangeability**: It is assumed that there is no unmeasured confounding after the study design employed restriction and adjustment. This means the risk of the outcome in the Drug Y group is the same as the risk of the outcome would have been in the Drug X group, had they received Drug Y instead (and vice-versa), conditional on the measured covariates.\n2.  **Positivity**: All individuals in the study population had a non-zero probability of receiving either Drug X or Drug Y.\n3.  **Consistency**: An individual's observed outcome under the treatment they actually received is the same as their potential outcome would have been under that same treatment.\n\nUnder these three assumptions, the associational incidence rate ratio is a valid estimate of the causal incidence rate ratio. Therefore, the value $2.21$ is the estimated causal effect. This suggests that initiating Drug X causes the incidence rate of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal bleeding to be $2.21$ times the rate that would be observed if the same population had initiated Drug Y.",

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($a$, $b$, $c$, $d$) and a clear, objective methodology for calculating the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) and its confidence interval. The data are internally consistent and the required computations are mathematically sound.\n\nThe analysis is based on a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table summarizing the counts of reports for a drug-event pair of interest:\n\n|                 | Event of Interest | Other Events  |\n|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|\n| Drug of Interest| $a$               | $b$           |\n| Other Drugs     | $c$               | $d$           |\n\nThe provided counts are:\n- $a = 47$\n- $b = 1203$\n- $c = 320$\n- $d = 75410$\n\nThe first step is to compute the Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR). The ROR is defined as the ratio of the odds of the event of interest occurring with the drug of interest to the odds of the event of interest occurring with other drugs.\n\nThe odds of the event of interest among reports for the drug of interest is given by the ratio of the number of reports with the event to the number of reports without the event for that specific drug:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{drug}} = \\frac{a}{b} $$\nThe odds of the event of interest among reports for all other drugs is:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{other}} = \\frac{c}{d} $$\nThe Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR) is the ratio of these two odds:\n$$ ROR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{drug}}}{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{other}}} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ ROR = \\frac{47 \\times 75410}{1203 \\times 320} = \\frac{3544270}{384960} \\approx 9.20683 $$\nRounded to four significant figures, the $ROR$ is $9.207$.\n\nThe next step is to construct a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval ($CI$) for the $ROR$.

The criteria for a signal are:\n1. The lower bound of the two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for the $ROR$ is greater than $1$.\n2. The number of cases, $a$, is at least $3$.\n\nWe check these conditions with our results:\n1. The lower bound of the $CI$ is $6.743$. Since $6.743 > 1$, this condition is met.\n2. The number of cases is $a = 47$. Since $47 \\geq 3$, this condition is met.\n\nAs both conditions are satisfied, we conclude that a statistical signal is present for this drug–event pair.

            "problem": "In a nationwide post-marketing active surveillance cohort evaluating a newly approved antihypertensive (exposure $A$) and the risk of hospitalization for hyperkalemia (outcome $Y$), investigators estimate a risk ratio $RR$ from a propensity score–adjusted analysis. Suppose the study reports an observed $RR = 2.05$ with a $95$% confidence interval (CI) from $1.31$ to $3.20$. To assess robustness to unmeasured confounding by a single binary factor $U$ not included in the adjustment set, epidemiologists use the E-value, defined conceptually as the minimal strength of association, on the risk ratio scale and conditional on measured covariates, that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome, to fully explain away the observed association if the true causal effect were null.\n\nStarting from standard definitions of the risk ratio and a well-tested bound on confounding bias on the risk ratio scale for a single binary unmeasured confounder, derive a closed-form expression for the E-value when the observed $RR>1$ under the simplifying assumption that the confounder–outcome and exposure–confounder risk ratios are equal to the same value $R \\geq 1$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part response: first, the derivation of a closed-form expression for the E-value, and second, the computation of this value for the lower limit of the given confidence interval.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the E-value Expression\n\nThe E-value quantifies the required strength of association for an unmeasured confounder to fully explain away an observed exposure-outcome association. Let $RR_{obs}$ be the observed risk ratio, which in this problem is greater than $1$. Let $RR_{true}$ be the true causal risk ratio. In the presence of confounding by a single unmeasured factor $U$, the observed risk ratio is related to the true risk ratio by a bias factor, $B$. To fully explain away the observed association implies that the true causal risk ratio is null ($RR_{true} = 1$), and the entire observed effect is due to confounding. This requires the bias factor $B$ to be equal to or greater than the observed risk ratio, $B \\ge RR_{obs}$.\n\nA well-established sharp bound for the bias factor $B$ due to a single binary unmeasured confounder $U$ is given by:\n$$ B \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1} $$\nHere, $RR_{AU}$ is the risk ratio relating the exposure $A$ to the confounder $U$, defined as $\\frac{P(U=1|A=1)}{P(U=1|A=0)}$ (assuming this ratio is $\\ge 1$). $RR_{UY}$ is the risk ratio relating the confounder $U$ to the outcome $Y$, conditional on the exposure $A$ (and any other measured covariates). For the confounder to explain away the association, the maximum possible bias must be at least as large as the observed risk ratio:\n$$ RR_{obs} \\le \\frac{RR_{AU} \\cdot RR_{UY}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UY} - 1} $$\nThe problem specifies the simplifying assumption that the confounder-exposure and confounder-outcome risk ratios are equal, i.e., $RR_{AU} = RR_{UY} = R$, for some $R \\ge 1$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$ RR_{obs} \\le \\frac{R \\cdot R}{R + R - 1} = \\frac{R^2}{2R - 1} $$\nThe E-value is defined as the *minimal* value of $R$ that satisfies this condition. To find this minimum, we solve the equation for the boundary condition:\n$$ RR_{obs} = \\frac{R^2}{2R - 1} $$\nSince we assume $R \\ge 1$, the denominator $2R - 1$ is positive. We can multiply both sides by $2R - 1$ to get:\n$$ RR_{obs} (2R - 1) = R^2 $$\nRearranging this into a standard quadratic form $aR^2+bR+c=0$ yields:\n$$ R^2 - 2(RR_{obs})R + RR_{obs} = 0 $$\nWe solve for $R$ using the quadratic formula, $R = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=-2(RR_{obs})$, and $c=RR_{obs}$:\n$$ R = \\frac{-(-2(RR_{obs})) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2(RR_{obs}))^2 - 4(1)(RR_{obs})}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{2(RR_{obs}) \\pm \\sqrt{4(RR_{obs})^2 - 4(RR_{obs})}}{2} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{2(RR_{obs}) \\pm 2\\sqrt{(RR_{obs})^2 - RR_{obs}}}{2} $$\n$$ R = RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{obs}^2 - RR_{obs}} $$\n$$ R = RR_{obs} \\pm \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)} $$\nThis gives two potential solutions for $R$. Let $f(R) = R^2 - 2(RR_{obs})R + RR_{obs}$. The inequality we need to satisfy is $\\frac{R^2}{2R - 1} \\ge RR_{obs}$, which is equivalent to $f(R) \\ge 0$ for $R \\ge 1$. Since $f(R)$ is a parabola opening upwards, the inequality holds for values of $R$ greater than or equal to the larger root, or less than or equal to the smaller root.\n\nThe problem states $RR_{obs} > 1$, which ensures the term under the square root is positive. We must choose the correct root. The smaller root is $R_1 = RR_{obs} - \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)}$. Let's check if $R_1 \\ge 1$. This is true if $RR_{obs} - 1 \\ge \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)}$. Squaring both sides (which are positive for $RR_{obs} > 1$) gives $(RR_{obs} - 1)^2 \\ge RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)$, which simplifies to $RR_{obs} - 1 \\ge RR_{obs}$, or $-1 \\ge 0$, a contradiction. Therefore, the smaller root is always less than $1$.\n\nGiven the constraint that $R \\ge 1$, we must choose the larger root. The smallest value of $R \\ge 1$ for which the inequality holds is therefore the larger root itself. This is the E-value.\nThe derived closed-form expression for the E-value for an observed risk ratio $RR_{obs} > 1$ is:\n$$ \\text{E-value} = RR_{obs} + \\sqrt{RR_{obs}(RR_{obs} - 1)} $$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the E-value\n\nThe problem provides an observed risk ratio of $RR = 2.05$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) of $(1.31, 3.20)$. We are asked to compute the E-value corresponding to the CI limit closest to the null value of $1$. This limit is the lower bound of the CI, which is $1.31$.\n\nWe set $RR_{obs} = 1.31$ and use the derived formula:\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.31 + \\sqrt{1.31(1.31 - 1)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.31 + \\sqrt{1.31(0.31)} $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} = 1.31 + \\sqrt{0.4061} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\sqrt{0.4061} \\approx 0.6372597... $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 1.31 + 0.6372597... $$\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 1.9472597... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $9$, and $4$. The fourth digit is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the third digit.\n$$ \\text{E-value} \\approx 1.95 $$\nThis E-value of $1.95$ means that to explain away the lower confidence limit of the observed association, an unmeasured confounder would need to be associated with both the exposure and the outcome with a risk ratio of at least $1.95$ each, above and beyond the measured covariates.",
