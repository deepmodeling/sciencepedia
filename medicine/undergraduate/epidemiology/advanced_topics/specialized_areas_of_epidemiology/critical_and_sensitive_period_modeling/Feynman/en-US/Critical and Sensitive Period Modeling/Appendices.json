This practice bridges that crucial gap between continuous theory and discrete data .

This exercise demystifies the coefficients from such models, revealing them as scaled representations of the average sensitivity within each time window.",

Specifically, let $t$ denote age in years during childhood, let $X(t)$ denote the exposure intensity at age $t$, and let $w(t)$ denote the age-specific weight encoding sensitivity at age $t$ such that larger $w(t)$ indicates greater sensitivity.

            "problem": "A public health team seeks to estimate the short-term effect of ambient particulate matter exposure on acute asthma hospitalizations and to identify whether there is a sensitive period of a few hours preceding the event. Consider the following simplified causal data-generating structure: for person $i$ at hour $t$, define $Y_{it}$ as an indicator of hospitalization onset during hour $t$, $E_{it}$ as exposure, $U_i$ as time-invariant characteristics (for example, baseline susceptibility), and $Z_{it}$ as time-varying covariates (for example, temperature). Suppose the true causal effect of exposure operates over a sensitive period of the previous $6$ hours, so that the risk at time $t$ depends on $\\sum_{h=1}^{6} E_{i,t-h}$ and $Z_{it}$, while $U_i$ affects baseline risk but not exposure effects. The population experiences strong seasonal and day-of-week cycles in both exposure and risk.\n\nThe team considers two designs:\n\n- Design A (prospective cohort with repeated measures): A cohort of $N = 2{,}000$ adults is followed for $T = 120$ days. Each day, individual-level outcomes are recorded, and exposure is available only as $24$-hour averages (midnight-to-midnight). Modeling is planned at the day level with adjustment for calendar time and daily mean temperature using flexible functions. No individual fixed effects are planned.\n\n- Design B (time-stratified case-crossover): Among $M = 1{,}200$ hospitalization cases in the same region, for each case hour $t$ several referent hours are sampled for the same individual from the same calendar month, matched on day-of-week and hour-of-day. Hourly exposure and hourly temperature are available and included as covariates in a conditional logistic model.\n\nAssume that outcome onset can be localized to the hour and that the sensitive period truly spans the last $6$ hours before onset, with negligible effect outside this window. Also assume that unmeasured time-invariant characteristics $U_i$ are strong determinants of baseline risk, and that some time-varying covariates $Z_{it}$ (for example, temperature) vary meaningfully at the hourly scale.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct under these conditions?\n\nA.

            "solution": "This problem requires an analysis of two epidemiological study designs in the context of identifying a short-term environmental trigger.\n\n#### **Analysis of Option A**\n*   **Statement:** Design B’s within-person matching removes confounding by $U_i$, and with hourly exposure and covariates it provides superior ability to localize a $6$-hour sensitive window compared with Design A, which only has $24$-hour averages.\n*   **Reasoning:**\n    1.  **Confounding by $U_i$**: The case-crossover design (Design B) compares exposure in the case period to exposure in referent periods for the same individual. This within-person comparison, formalized by conditional logistic regression, automatically controls for all time-invariant individual characteristics, such as genetics or baseline health status ($U_i$).\n    2.  **Ability to Localize Sensitive Window**: The true exposure window is 6 hours long. Design B uses hourly data, which allows for the direct modeling of exposure in this 6-hour window (and other short windows) to identify the true effect. Design A uses 24-hour average exposure, making it impossible to distinguish the effect of exposure in a specific 6-hour period from exposure at other times of the day. Thus, Design B's temporal resolution is far superior for this research question.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n#### **Analysis of Option B**\n*   **Statement:** Even with perfect control of daily mean temperature, Design A’s use of $24$-hour average exposure when the true sensitive window is $6$ hours will tend to attenuate the estimated short-term effect toward the null due to temporal aggregation.\n*   **Reasoning:** The etiologic exposure is a high-frequency 6-hour signal. Design A measures a low-frequency 24-hour average. This mismatch is a form of exposure measurement error known as temporal aggregation. This type of error averages out the \"signal\" (the short, high-exposure period) with \"noise\" (the other 18 hours of lower exposure), leading to a measured exposure that is less variable and less correlated with the outcome than the true exposure. This classically leads to attenuation, or bias towards the null, of the estimated effect coefficient.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n#### **Analysis of Option C**\n*   **Statement:** As specified, Design B will necessarily be biased by seasonal trends in exposure because matching within the same month and day-of-week cannot control confounding by season.\n*   **Reasoning:** This is incorrect. The time-stratified case-crossover design is specifically constructed to control for confounding by slow-moving time trends like seasonality. By selecting referent periods from the same calendar month and day-of-the-week as the case period, the design ensures that long-term trends are balanced between the comparison periods and do not bias the estimate of the acute effect.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n#### **Analysis of Option D**\n*   **Statement:** Because Design A uses repeated measures, it inherently controls for time-invariant confounders $U_i$ even without including individual fixed effects.\n*   **Reasoning:** This is incorrect. A study with repeated measures (a cohort or panel design) *allows* for the control of time-invariant confounders, but it does not do so \"inherently\". Control is achieved by using an appropriate analytical model, such as a fixed-effects model. The problem explicitly states that \"No individual fixed effects are planned\" for Design A. Without fixed effects, a standard regression model will be subject to confounding by any time-invariant factors ($U_i$) that are correlated with the individuals' average exposure levels.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n#### **Analysis of Option E**\n*   **Statement:** When acute events are rare and the true induction period is short, Design B can be more statistically efficient than Design A for estimating short-term effects, because it focuses on exposure contrasts in close temporal proximity to the event and conditions on the individual.\n*   **Reasoning:** This statement correctly identifies a key advantage of the case-crossover design. For rare events, a cohort study (Design A) spends most of its resources on non-informative person-time (periods with no event). The case-crossover design (Design B) focuses only on individuals who experienced an event (cases), comparing their exposure just before the event to their exposure at other times. This focus on the most informative periods and individuals makes the design highly efficient for studying acute triggers of rare events.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.",
