This exercise provides a classic scenario analogous to many public health situations, such as monitoring whether a population's average blood pressure has deviated from a known baseline. By working through this problem, you will practice conducting a one-sample $z$-test, a foundational statistical procedure for determining if a sample mean provides significant evidence to conclude that the true population mean is different from a hypothesized value .",

            "problem": "A pharmaceutical company is manufacturing a liquid medication where the precise dosage is critical for patient safety. The automated filling machines are calibrated to dispense a mean volume of $\\mu_0 = 75.0$ mL per vial. The filling process is known to have a stable population standard deviation of $\\sigma = 1.5$ mL. As part of a routine quality control check, a random sample of $n = 36$ vials is selected from the production line. The average volume of medication in this sample is measured to be $\\bar{x} = 75.6$ mL.\n\nYour task is to conduct a hypothesis test to evaluate whether the filling process is still centered at the target volume. Specifically, calculate the p-value associated with a test where the alternative hypothesis is that the true mean fill volume differs from $75.0$ mL.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.",

            "introduction": "Moving beyond continuous data like means, epidemiologists frequently work with binary outcomes: a patient survives or does not, an individual is exposed or unexposed. This practice demonstrates how the concept of a p-value extends to proportions and count data using an exact binomial test. Here, we investigate whether a new treatment improves survival rates, a common objective in clinical trials, providing you with the skills to assess evidence when dealing with discrete outcomes .",

            "problem": "A materials science lab is testing a new gene-editing technique designed to increase the stress resistance of a particular bacterial strain used in bioremediation. With the standard, unedited strain, the probability of a single bacterium surviving a specific high-stress test is exactly 0.5. The researchers hypothesize that their new technique improves this survival rate.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, they subject a sample of 12 edited bacteria to the high-stress test. They observe that 9 of the 12 bacteria survive. Assume that the survival of each bacterium is an independent event. The researchers set up a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 0.5$, representing no improvement, and the alternative hypothesis $H_a: p > 0.5$, representing an improvement in the survival rate.\n\nCalculate the exact p-value corresponding to this experimental outcome.

            "introduction": "Calculating a p-value is a technical skill, but interpreting it correctly is an essential scientific art. This final exercise shifts our focus from calculation to critical thinking, addressing one of the most common and consequential misinterpretations of statistical results.

            "problem": "Two independent medical research teams, Team Alpha and Team Beta, are investigating the effectiveness of a new experimental drug intended to improve cognitive function in patients with mild memory loss. Both teams establish the same null hypothesis ($H_0$), which states that the drug has no effect on cognitive scores compared to a placebo. The corresponding alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) for both is that the drug does have an effect.\n\nAfter conducting their respective randomized controlled trials, Team Alpha reports a p-value of $0.04$ for their primary cognitive endpoint. Team Beta, in their independent study, reports a p-value of $0.06$ for the same endpoint.\n\nA science journalist reviews both studies and writes an article with the headline: \"Conflicting Results on New Memory Drug: Team Alpha Finds a Significant Effect, Team Beta Finds None.\" The article concludes that Team Alpha's study supports the drug's use while Team Beta's study does not.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most statistically sound critique of the journalist's conclusion?\n\nA. The journalist is entirely correct. Using the standard scientific convention of a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, Team Alpha's result is statistically significant while Team Beta's is not. Therefore, the studies have produced opposing conclusions.\n\nB. The p-value of $0.04$ indicates there is a 4% probability that the drug is ineffective (the null hypothesis is true), while the p-value of $0.06$ indicates a 6% probability that the drug is ineffective. The journalist is correct that the 4% risk is acceptable but the 6% risk is not.\n\nC. The two p-values are very close to each other and provide a similar weight of evidence against the null hypothesis. The journalist's conclusion of \"a significant effect\" versus \"no effect\" is a poor interpretation that exaggerates the minor difference between the two results.\n\nD. Both studies failed to prove the drug is effective. Since neither p-value is zero, there is still a chance that the observed results were due to random variation, and therefore no conclusions should be drawn from either study.",
            "solution": "We formalize the hypotheses shared by both studies as $H_{0}$: no drug effect on cognitive scores versus $H_{a}$: some drug effect. A $p$-value is defined as\n$$\np=\\Pr(\\text{test statistic at least as extreme as observed} \\mid H_{0}),\n$$\nwhich quantifies how incompatible the observed data are with $H_{0}$. It is not equal to $\\Pr(H_{0}\\mid \\text{data})$.\n\nA conventional decision rule at significance level $\\alpha$ rejects $H_{0}$ when $p \\le \\alpha$. With $\\alpha=0.05$, Team Alpha’s $p=0.04$ would lead to rejecting $H_{0}$, while Team Beta’s $p=0.06$ would lead to not rejecting $H_{0}$. However, the threshold $\\alpha=0.05$ is arbitrary, and the two $p$-values $0.04$ and $0.06$ are very close, implying similar and weak-to-moderate evidence against $H_{0}$. Treating these results as “opposing” is a dichotomization artifact rather than a substantive difference in evidence.\n\nAssessing the options:\n- Option A appeals to the mechanical $\\alpha=0.05$ rule but incorrectly characterizes the studies as having opposing conclusions; in reality, the evidential strength is similar, and dichotomizing exaggerates differences.\n- Option B misinterprets $p$-values as $\\Pr(H_{0}\\text{ true}\\mid \\text{data})$, which is incorrect; $p$-values are $\\Pr(\\text{data} \\mid H_{0})$-type quantities, not posterior probabilities of $H_{0}$.\n- Option C correctly notes that the two $p$-values are close and provide similar weight of evidence, and that the journalist’s “significant vs none” framing is a poor interpretation that overstates a minor difference.\n- Option D is too strong and misleading: $p$-values virtually never equal zero, and one can still draw graded evidential conclusions; failing to reject $H_{0}$ does not mean “no conclusions,” only that evidence is insufficient at the chosen threshold.\n\nTherefore, the most statistically sound critique is Option C.",
