The per-protocol estimand is the difference in the risk of the outcome had all participants fully adhered to the protocol in the intervention arm versus the control arm. In practice, nonadherence occurs, and investigators use Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to reweight adherent participants so that their covariate distribution approximates that of the full trial population under each arm. Assume the following:\n\n- The binary outcome is denoted by $Y$, with $Y=1$ indicating the occurrence of the outcome by $12$ weeks and $Y=0$ otherwise.\n- In the intervention arm, there are four adherent participants indexed by $i=1,\\dots,4$ with weights $w_i=(1.0,\\,1.5,\\,3.0,\\,0.8)$ and observed outcomes $Y_i=(1,\\,0,\\,1,\\,0)$.\n- In the control arm, there are four adherent participants indexed by $j=1,\\dots,4$ with weights $v_j=(0.9,\\,1.2,\\,2.5,\\,0.7)$ and observed outcomes $Z_j=(0,\\,1,\\,0,\\,1)$.\n\nStarting from first principles in epidemiology, use the definition of risk as an expectation of the indicator outcome under each protocol and the concept that IPW reweights adherent individuals to recover the target arm-specific population risk.

It describes a standard epidemiological scenario involving a randomized trial with nonadherence, a common issue addressed using established causal inference methods like IPW. The data provided are complete and consistent for the task. The quantities to be calculated are clearly defined. The terms are used precisely within the context of clinical trial analysis. Therefore, a problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to estimate the per-protocol risk difference. This requires estimating the risk in each arm under the hypothetical condition that all participants adhered to their assigned protocol. We use Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to adjust for the selection bias introduced by nonadherence.\n\nLet $A$ be the indicator for the randomized arm, with $A=1$ for intervention and $A=0$ for control. Let $Y$ be the binary outcome. Let $C$ be the indicator for adherence, with $C=1$ for adherents and $C=0$ for nonadherents. The weights, $w_i$ for the intervention arm and $v_j$ for the control arm, are the inverse probabilities of adherence for each participant, i.e., $w_i = 1/P(C=1 \\mid A=1, X_i)$ for a participant $i$ in the intervention arm with covariates $X_i$.\n\nThe risk in an arm is the expectation of the outcome variable, $E[Y]$. For a binary outcome, this is equivalent to the probability of the outcome occurring, $P(Y=1)$. The IPW approach estimates this population risk by calculating a weighted average of the outcomes observed among the adherent subgroup. The weights are designed to make the adherent subgroup \"representative\" of the full randomized group.\n\nThe appropriate sample analog for the risk in a given arm is the stabilized IPW estimator of the mean. For the intervention arm, the risk, $\\hat{R}_{int}$, is the sum of the weighted outcomes divided by the sum of the weights:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{int} = \\frac{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{adherent, int}} w_i Y_i}{\\sum_{i \\in \\text{adherent, int}} w_i}\n$$\nThe numerator, $\\sum w_i Y_i$, represents the estimated number of events in the full target population (the entire intervention arm), and the denominator, $\\sum w_i$, represents the estimated total size of this target population.\n\nSimilarly, for the control arm, the risk, $\\hat{R}_{ctrl}$, is:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{ctrl} = \\frac{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{adherent, ctrl}} v_j Z_j}{\\sum_{j \\in \\text{adherent, ctrl}} v_j}\n$$\nThe per-protocol weighted risk difference, $\\Delta\\hat{R}_{PP}$, is then the difference between these two estimated risks:\n$$\n\\Delta\\hat{R}_{PP} = \\hat{R}_{int} - \\hat{R}_{ctrl}\n$$\n\n### Calculation\nUsing the data provided:\n\nFor the intervention arm:\n- The observed outcomes are $Y_i = (1, 0, 1, 0)$.\n- The corresponding weights are $w_i = (1.0, 1.5, 3.0, 0.8)$.\n- The sum of the weighted outcomes is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i Y_i = (1.0 \\times 1) + (1.5 \\times 0) + (3.0 \\times 1) + (0.8 \\times 0) = 1.0 + 0 + 3.0 + 0 = 4.0\n$$\n- The sum of the weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i = 1.0 + 1.5 + 3.0 + 0.8 = 6.3\n$$\n- The estimated risk in the intervention arm is:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{int} = \\frac{4.0}{6.3}\n$$\n\nFor the control arm:\n- The observed outcomes are $Z_j = (0, 1, 0, 1)$.\n- The corresponding weights are $v_j = (0.9, 1.2, 2.5, 0.7)$.\n- The sum of the weighted outcomes is:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^4 v_j Z_j = (0.9 \\times 0) + (1.2 \\times 1) + (2.5 \\times 0) + (0.7 \\times 1) = 0 + 1.2 + 0 + 0.7 = 1.9\n$$\n- The sum of the weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^4 v_j = 0.9 + 1.2 + 2.5 + 0.7 = 5.3\n$$\n- The estimated risk in the control arm is:\n$$\n\\hat{R}_{ctrl} = \\frac{1.9}{5.3}\n$$\n\nThe per-protocol weighted risk difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta\\hat{R}_{PP} = \\hat{R}_{int} - \\hat{R}_{ctrl} = \\frac{4.0}{6.3} - \\frac{1.9}{5.3}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\Delta\\hat{R}_{PP} \\approx 0.63492063... - 0.35849056... = 0.27643007...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.2764$.\n\n### Explanation of Weight Instability\nInverse probability weighted estimators, such as the one used here, can be unstable when some weights are extremely large or when the weights are highly variable. The variance of the IPW estimator is sensitive to the second moment of the weight distribution. An estimator of the arm-specific risk, $\\hat{R} = \\frac{\\sum w_i Y_i}{\\sum w_i}$, is a weighted average where each individual $i$'s contribution to the final estimate is proportional to their weight $w_i$.\n\nIf one individual, say participant $k$, has a weight $w_k$ that is much larger than all other weights, this individual will have a disproportionate influence on the estimate. The total estimated risk becomes heavily dependent on that single individual's outcome, $Y_k$. In the extreme case where $w_k \\gg \\sum_{i \\neq k} w_i$, the estimator approaches $\\hat{R} \\approx \\frac{w_k Y_k}{w_k} = Y_k$. The entire population risk estimate hinges on the binary outcome of a single person. This leads to a high-variance (unstable) estimator, as a small change in the data (e.g., if that one person's outcome had been different) would cause a large swing in the final estimate.\n\nIn the provided data, we can observe this phenomenon. In the intervention arm, participant $i=3$ has a weight of $w_3 = 3.0$. The sum of all weights is $\\sum w_i = 6.3$. This single participant accounts for $3.0/6.3 \\approx 47.6\\%$ of the total weight in the arm. Their outcome is $Y_3=1$, and they contribute $3.0$ to the numerator sum of $4.0$. If this participant's outcome had been $Y_3=0$, the risk estimate for the intervention arm would have plummeted from $\\hat{R}_{int} = 4.0/6.3 \\approx 0.635$ to $\\hat{R}_{int} = (4.0 - 3.0)/6.3 = 1.0/6.3 \\approx 0.159$. This dramatic change, contingent on one data point, exemplifies the instability caused by an influential, high-weight observation. Similarly, in the control arm, participant $j=3$ has a weight of $v_3 = 2.5$ on a total of $5.3$, accounting for $\\approx 47.2\\%$ of the weight. The high variability and presence of large relative weights in this small dataset contribute to the potential for an imprecise and unstable estimate of the per-protocol effect.",

Our task is to find the minimum confounder associations that can generate a bias of this magnitude.\n\nA key result from the theory of confounding (based on the work of Cornfield and others, and formalized by Ding & VanderWeele) provides an upper bound on the magnitude of the bias factor $B$ that can be produced by a single unmeasured confounder. This bound is a function of the strength of the confounder's associations with the exposure and the outcome. The maximum bias, $B_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is given by:\n$$ B_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\frac{RR_{AU} \\times RR_{UD}}{RR_{AU} + RR_{UD} - 1} $$\nThis bound is achievable under a worst-case scenario for the confounder's prevalence.\n\nTo fully explain the observed risk ratio $\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$, the bias factor $B$ must be at least $\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$.

Substituting this into the boundary of the inequality gives:\n$$ \\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} = \\frac{E \\times E}{E + E - 1} = \\frac{E^2}{2E - 1} $$\n\nWe now derive the closed-form expression for $E$ by solving this equation for $E$ in terms of $\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$.\n$$ \\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} (2E - 1) = E^2 $$\nRearranging the terms yields a quadratic equation in $E$:\n$$ E^2 - (2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}})E + \\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this equation for $E$ using the quadratic formula, $E = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a=1$, $b=-2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$, and $c=\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{-(-2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}})^2 - 4(1)(\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}})}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} \\pm \\sqrt{4\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}^2 - 4\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} \\pm \\sqrt{4\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}(\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} - 1)}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\frac{2\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} \\pm 2\\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}(\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} - 1)}}{2} $$\n$$ E = \\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} \\pm \\sqrt{\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}}(\\widehat{RR}_{\\mathrm{PP}} - 1)} $$\n\nThis gives two potential solutions for $E$.
