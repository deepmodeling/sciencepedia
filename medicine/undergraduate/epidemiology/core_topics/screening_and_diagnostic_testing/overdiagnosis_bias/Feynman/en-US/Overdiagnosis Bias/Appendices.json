Cumulative incidence (CI) is defined as $CI = \\frac{\\text{new cases during follow-up}}{\\text{population at risk at start}}$ scaled to a chosen population base. In the screened arm, the cumulative incidence is $CI_{\\text{screen}} = 420$ cases per $100{,}000$, and in the concurrent control arm, the cumulative incidence is $CI_{\\text{control}} = 310$ cases per $100{,}000$.\n\nFrom first principles, overdiagnosis bias in screening arises when detection includes cases that would not have presented clinically during the follow-up, inflating the observed cumulative incidence in the screened arm relative to the control arm.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to overdiagnosis bias using data from a randomized controlled trial. Let $CI_{\\text{screen}}$ be the cumulative incidence of the disease in the screened group and $CI_{\\text{control}}$ be the cumulative incidence in the control group.\n\nThe given values are:\n$$\nCI_{\\text{screen}} = 420 \\text{ cases per } 100{,}000\n$$\n$$\nCI_{\\text{control}} = 310 \\text{ cases per } 100{,}000\n$$\n\nThe fundamental assumption in this analysis is that the control arm's cumulative incidence, $CI_{\\text{control}}$, represents the background rate of disease diagnosis that would occur naturally (i.e., become clinically apparent) in the population over the follow-up period $T$. The screened arm is subject to this same background rate, but the screening test may detect additional cases. These additional cases—those that would not have become clinically apparent during the period $T$—are considered to be overdiagnosed, according to the problem's framework.\n\n**1. Absolute Overdiagnosis**\n\nThe problem defines absolute overdiagnosis as \"the excess cumulative incidence attributable to screening.\" This is the arithmetic difference between the cumulative incidence observed in the screened arm and that in the control arm. This excess represents the number of additional cases detected per $100{,}000$ people due to the screening intervention.\n\nLet $OD_{\\text{abs}}$ denote the absolute overdiagnosis. The formula is:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{abs}} = CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{abs}} = 420 - 310 = 110\n$$\nThe absolute overdiagnosis is $110$ cases per $100{,}000$ population.\n\n**2. Relative Overdiagnosis**\n\nThe problem defines relative overdiagnosis as \"the excess normalized by the screened arm’s cumulative incidence.\" This metric expresses the number of overdiagnosed cases as a fraction of the total number of cases detected in the screened arm. It answers the question: \"Of all the cases found by screening, what proportion is due to overdiagnosis?\"\n\nLet $OD_{\\text{rel}}$ denote the relative overdiagnosis. The formula is:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\text{Absolute Overdiagnosis}}{CI_{\\text{screen}}} = \\frac{CI_{\\text{screen}} - CI_{\\text{control}}}{CI_{\\text{screen}}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values and the previously calculated absolute overdiagnosis:\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{110}{420}\n$$\n\nTo express this as a fraction in simplest terms, we find the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator. Both $110$ and $420$ are divisible by $10$.\n$$\nOD_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{110 \\div 10}{420 \\div 10} = \\frac{11}{42}\n$$\nThe numerator, $11$, is a prime number. The denominator, $42$, is not divisible by $11$ ($42 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 7$). Therefore, the fraction $\\frac{11}{42}$ is in its simplest terms.\n\nThe two requested quantities are an absolute overdiagnosis of $110$ cases per $100{,}000$ and a relative overdiagnosis of $\\frac{11}{42}$.",

            "introduction": "Beyond trial data, the statistical properties of a screening test itself play a crucial role in the potential for harm.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. There are no contradictions, unrealistic conditions, or ambiguities in the terminology. The question about overdiagnosis is a well-established and important topic in public health and medical screening. The problem is a straightforward application of fundamental principles and is not trivial or tautological.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and then use it to analyze the effects of prevalence on screening outcomes. The $PPV$ is defined as the probability that a subject has the disease given that they have a positive test result. Let $D$ be the event that a person has the disease, and $D^c$ be the event that they do not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given definitions can be expressed as:\n-   Prevalence: $\\pi = P(D)$\n-   Sensitivity: $Se = P(T^+ \\mid D)$\n-   Specificity: $Sp = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$\n-   Positive Predictive Value: $PPV = P(D \\mid T^+)$\n\nWe use Bayes' theorem to derive the expression for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe numerator terms are given directly: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = Se$ and $P(D) = \\pi$.\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We can expand this using the law of total probability over the partition of the population into those with the disease ($D$) and those without ($D^c$):\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe need to express the terms $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ and $P(D^c)$ using the given parameters.\nThe probability of not having the disease is simply $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - \\pi$.\nThe term $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual, which is the false positive rate. It can be derived from the specificity, $Sp$. Since for any given state (like $D^c$), the test can only be positive or negative, the probabilities must sum to $1$:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$$\nGiven $Sp = P(T^- \\mid D^c)$, we have:\n$$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\nNow we can substitute these back into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(\\pi) + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)$$\nFinally, substituting this denominator and the numerator terms into the Bayes' theorem formula for $PPV$ yields the desired analytic expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}$$\nThis is the expression for the positive predictive value in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $PPV$ using the given data: $\\pi=0.02$, $Se=0.90$, and $Sp=0.95$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.02)}{(0.90)(0.02) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.02)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + (0.05)(0.98)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.018}{0.018 + 0.049}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.018}{0.067}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.2686567...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $PPV = 0.2687$. This means that for this screening program, only about $26.87\\%$ of individuals who test positive actually have the condition.\n\nFinally, we explain how lowering prevalence ($\\pi$) affects the fraction of positive tests that are false positives and increases the risk of overdiagnosis.\n\nThe fraction of positive results that are true positives is the $PPV$. Consequently, the fraction of positive results that are false positives is $1 - PPV$. Using our derived expression:\n$$\\text{Fraction of False Positives} = 1 - PPV = 1 - \\frac{Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}$$\n$$\\text{Fraction of False Positives} = \\frac{(Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)) - Se \\cdot \\pi}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)} = \\frac{(1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}{Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)}$$\nLet's analyze this expression as prevalence, $\\pi$, decreases, holding $Se$ and $Sp$ fixed. The term $Se \\cdot \\pi$ represents the rate of true positives in the total population, while the term $(1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)$ represents the rate of false positives. The denominator of the $PPV$ formula, $P(T^+)$, is the sum of these two rates.\n\nAs $\\pi$ is lowered (i.e., $\\pi \\to 0$), the numerator of the $PPV$ expression, $Se \\cdot \\pi$, approaches $0$. The denominator, $Se \\cdot \\pi + (1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi)$, approaches $(1 - Sp)$. Thus, $PPV \\to 0$ as $\\pi \\to 0$. This means that in a population with very low prevalence, a positive test result is increasingly unlikely to indicate the true presence of disease.\n\nCorrespondingly, the fraction of positive tests that are false positives, $1 - PPV$, approaches $1$ as $\\pi \\to 0$. In a low-prevalence setting, the absolute number of true positives ($Se \\cdot \\pi \\cdot N$, for a population of size $N$) becomes very small, while the absolute number of false positives ($(1 - Sp)(1 - \\pi) \\cdot N$) remains relatively large because it is drawn from the vast majority of the population that is disease-free. The result is that the pool of individuals with positive test results becomes dominated by false positives.\n\nThis mechanism directly increases the risk of overdiagnosis and other harms of screening. A large number of healthy individuals receive a false positive result, triggering a cascade of further investigations (e.g., confirmatory tests, imaging, biopsies) that are often invasive, costly, and carry their own risks of complications and psychological distress. While a false positive (misdiagnosis) is distinct from overdiagnosis (correct diagnosis of a clinically insignificant condition), the flood of false positives in a low-prevalence screening program is a primary driver of the harms often grouped under the umbrella of overdiagnosis. It burdens the healthcare system and exposes a large number of healthy people to unnecessary medical procedures and anxiety, with little to no chance of benefit.",

            "introduction": "To truly understand overdiagnosis, we must consider the natural history of the disease. Not all diseases progress at the same rate, and screening is inherently more likely to detect slow-growing, indolent conditions simply because they exist in a detectable, asymptomatic state for a longer period.

Tumors enter a preclinical (screen-detectable but asymptomatic) state at a constant onset rate $\\alpha$ per unit time in a large, steady-state population.

Here $\\mathrm{Exp}(\\lambda)$ denotes the exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.

            "solution": "The problem is to determine the expected fraction of screen-detected tumors that are of the indolent subtype in a steady-state population, and then to evaluate this fraction for a given set of parameters.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement confirms that it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard epidemiological model for length-biased sampling in cancer screening. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem lies in the relationship between incidence, prevalence, and duration for a condition in a steady-state system. For a condition with a constant incidence rate and a mean duration, the number of individuals with that condition at any given time (the prevalence) is the product of the incidence rate and the mean duration.\n$$\n\\text{Prevalence} = \\text{Incidence Rate} \\times \\text{Mean Duration}\n$$\nIn this context, the \"condition\" is the presence of a preclinical, screen-detectable tumor. The screening program at time $t=0$ identifies all prevalent preclinical cases. Therefore, the set of screen-detected tumors corresponds to the entire pool of prevalent preclinical tumors at $t=0$.\n\nLet $N$ be the total size of the population and $\\alpha$ be the per-capita onset rate of preclinical tumors. The total incidence rate of new tumors in the population is $N\\alpha$.\n\nThe problem specifies two subtypes of tumors:\n1.  Indolent tumors: Occur with probability $p$.

Aggressive tumors: Occur with probability $1-p$. The preclinical sojourn time, $S_A$, follows an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda_A$, i.e., $S_A \\sim \\mathrm{Exp}(\\lambda_A)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the incidence rates for each subtype.\nThe incidence rate of new indolent tumors, $I_I$, is:\n$$\nI_I = N \\alpha p\n$$\nThe incidence rate of new aggressive tumors, $I_A$, is:\n$$\nI_A = N \\alpha (1-p)\n$$\n\nNext, we find the mean sojourn time, $E[S]$, for each subtype.
