            "problem": "A municipality launches a breast cancer screening program for its eligible target population. At the start of the year, the eligible target population is $25{,}000$ individuals, of whom $20{,}000$ individuals undergo screening during the year. Among those screened, $35$ cancers are identified as screen-detected cases. Using core epidemiologic definitions, proceed as follows:\n\n1. State the fundamental definitions of screening coverage and screening yield in terms of counts and denominators.\n\n2. Based on those definitions alone, formally define the detection rate per $1{,}000$ screened as a quantity that represents the expected number of screen-detected cases per $1{,}000$ individuals screened.

Using the given data for this program, compute the detection rate per $1{,}000$ screened.\n\nProvide your final answer as a single number. Do not use a percentage sign. Express the quantity in the unit “cases per $1{,}000$ screened.” No rounding is required; report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The problem requires the application of standard definitions for screening program evaluation metrics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part response: defining key terms, deriving a relationship, and performing a calculation. We will address each part in sequence.\n\nLet us first define the variables based on the data provided:\n- $N_{target}$: The size of the eligible target population. In this problem, $N_{target} = 25,000$.\n- $N_{screened}$: The number of individuals who undergo screening. In this problem, $N_{screened} = 20,000$.\n- $N_{cases}$: The number of screen-detected cases, which are cases of the disease identified among the screened population. In this problem, $N_{cases} = 35$.\n\n**Part 1: Fundamental Definitions**\n\nWe are asked to state the fundamental definitions of screening coverage and screening yield.\n\n**Screening Coverage ($C$)** is defined as the proportion of the eligible target population that undergoes the screening test during a specified time period. It is a measure of the program's reach. Mathematically, it is expressed as the ratio of the number of individuals screened to the number of individuals in the eligible target population:\n$$\nC = \\frac{N_{screened}}{N_{target}}\n$$\n\n**Screening Yield ($Y$)** is defined as the proportion of individuals screened who are identified as having the disease. It is a measure of the number of cases detected by the screening process among those tested. It is also known as the case-detection rate. Mathematically, it is expressed as the ratio of the number of screen-detected cases to the number of individuals screened:\n$$\nY = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Detection Rate per $1,000$ Screened**\n\nWe are asked to formally define the detection rate per $1,000$ screened and derive its relationship to the yield.\n\nThe **detection rate per $k$ individuals screened** is a standardized measure that expresses the number of cases detected for a standard population size of $k$. This allows for comparison across programs or populations of different sizes. In this problem, the scaling factor is $k=1,000$.\n\nFormally, the detection rate per $1,000$ screened, which we denote as $R_{1000}$, is the number of screen-detected cases divided by the number of individuals screened, with the resulting proportion multiplied by $1,000$:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}} \\times 1000\n$$\nThe quantity $R_{1000}$ represents the expected number of cases that would be detected if $1,000$ individuals were screened, assuming a constant rate of detection.\n\nTo derive the relationship between the detection rate per $1,000$ screened ($R_{1000}$) and the screening yield ($Y$), we can directly substitute the definition of yield into the expression for the detection rate. From Part 1, we have $Y = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $R_{1000}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{1000} = Y \\times 1000\n$$\nThis general expression shows that the detection rate per $1,000$ screened is simply the screening yield multiplied by a scaling factor of $1,000$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the detection rate per $1,000$ screened for the given program. We will use the formula for $R_{1000}$ derived in Part 2 and the data provided in the problem statement.\n\nThe given data are:\n- Number of screen-detected cases, $N_{cases} = 35$.\n- Number of individuals screened, $N_{screened} = 20,000$.\n\nThe information about the eligible target population, $N_{target} = 25,000$, is necessary for calculating screening coverage but is not required for calculating the detection rate per $1,000$ screened.\n\nUsing the formula for $R_{1000}$:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{N_{cases}}{N_{screened}} \\times 1000\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{35}{20,000} \\times 1000\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression:\n$$\nR_{1000} = \\frac{35}{20}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives the final numerical answer:\n$$\nR_{1000} = 1.75\n$$\nTherefore, the detection rate is $1.75$ cases per $1,000$ individuals screened.",

This practice introduces the Number Needed to Screen (NNS), an intuitive and powerful metric that answers the question: \"On average, how many people must we screen to detect one true case of the disease?\" By deriving the formula for NNS from the principles of prevalence and detection probability, you will gain a deeper insight into how population characteristics and test accuracy determine a program's practical efficiency .",

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the Number Needed to Screen ($\\text{NNS}$). The $\\text{NNS}$ is defined as the expected number of individuals to screen to find one true case. This can be framed as a \"waiting time\" problem in probability theory.\n\nLet $S$ be the event of a \"success\" in a single screening trial, where success is defined as screening an individual who is a detected true case. We need to find the probability of this event, $P(S)$.\n\nFor a success to occur, two independent events must happen for a randomly selected individual from the target population who is screened:\n1.  The individual must have the disease. The probability of this event is the prevalence, $P(\\text{diseased}) = \\pi$.\n2.  Given that the individual has the disease, they must be successfully detected by the screening program. The problem defines this conditional probability as $P(\\text{detected} | \\text{diseased}) = \\theta$.\n\nThe probability of success, $P(S)$, is the joint probability of an individual being both diseased and detected. Using the definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(S) = P(\\text{detected} \\cap \\text{diseased}) = P(\\text{detected} | \\text{diseased}) \\times P(\\text{diseased})$$\nSubstituting the given symbols, the probability of success for any single Bernoulli trial is:\n$$p = \\theta \\pi$$\nThe screening process is modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials, each with a success probability of $p$. The number of trials, $N$, required to achieve the first success follows a geometric distribution with parameter $p$. The probability mass function is $P(N=k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$.\n\nThe $\\text{NNS}$ is the expected value of this random variable $N$. The expected value of a geometric distribution is the reciprocal of the success probability:\n$$\\text{NNS} = E[N] = \\frac{1}{p}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p$, we obtain the closed-form expression for $\\text{NNS}$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $\\pi$:\n$$\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\theta \\pi}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values: $\\theta = 0.9$ and $\\pi = 0.005$.\n$$\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{(0.9) \\times (0.005)}$$\nFirst, calculate the product in the denominator:\n$$0.9 \\times 0.005 = 0.0045$$\nNow, calculate the NNS:\n$$\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{0.0045}$$\nTo perform the division, we can write this as a fraction:\n$$\\text{NNS} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{45}{10000}} = \\frac{10000}{45} = \\frac{2000}{9}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\\text{NNS} = 222.222...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $2$, $2$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate at the fourth significant digit).\nThe final numerical answer is $222.2$.",

            "introduction": "In the real world, optimizing a screening program involves more than just maximizing the number of cases detected. Program managers must confront difficult trade-offs, most notably the balance between finding true cases (yield) and the harm caused by false alarms (false positives).

            "problem": "A population-based screening program for a target condition is conducted in a single round among attendees with disease prevalence $\\pi = 0.01$. The program adopts a binary test with two possible operating points determined by the positivity threshold. The positivity threshold determines the referral (recall) rate, defined as the probability that a screened individual is referred for diagnostic workup. Two operating points are considered:\n\n- Operating point A: referral rate $r_{A} = 0.04$ with sensitivity $\\mathrm{Se}_{A} = 0.80$.\n- Operating point B: referral rate $r_{B} = 0.08$ with sensitivity $\\mathrm{Se}_{B} = 0.90$.\n\nAssume that the disease prevalence $\\pi$ is the same among attendees at both operating points and that the specificity adjusts with the threshold as needed to attain the stated referral rates.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, disease prevalence, and the law of total probability, justify conceptually why optimizing the referral rate solely to increase yield (true cases detected) can be harmful if false-positive consequences are not considered. Then, derive and compute the expected change in the number of false positives per $1{,}000$ screened individuals when moving from operating point A to operating point B.\n\nExpress the final numeric answer as a count per $1{,}000$ individuals screened and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, internally consistent, and possesses all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two parts: a conceptual justification and a quantitative derivation.\n\n**Part 1: Conceptual Justification**\n\nYield, in the context of a screening program, refers to the number of true cases of a disease that are detected. For a population of size $N$ with disease prevalence $\\pi$, the total number of individuals with the disease is $N\\pi$. The sensitivity of the test, $\\mathrm{Se}$, is the probability of a positive test given the presence of disease, $P(T^+|D^+)$. Therefore, the expected number of true positives, or the yield, is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Yield} = N_{TP} = N \\times \\pi \\times \\mathrm{Se}\n$$\nMoving from operating point A to operating point B involves increasing the sensitivity from $\\mathrm{Se}_{A} = 0.80$ to $\\mathrm{Se}_{B} = 0.90$. This change directly increases the yield, as more of the existing cases will be detected.\n\nHowever, the referral rate, $r$, which is the total probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, also increases from $r_{A} = 0.04$ to $r_{B} = 0.08$. The total number of referrals is composed of both true positives (individuals with the disease who test positive) and false positives (individuals without the disease who test positive). By the law of total probability, the referral rate can be expressed as:\n$$\nr = P(T^+) = P(T^+, D^+) + P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nHere, $P(T^+, D^+)$ is the proportion of the population that are true positives, given by $P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+) = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi$. The term $P(T^+, D^-)$ is the proportion of the population that are false positives, given by $P(T^+|D^-)P(D^-) = (1-\\mathrm{Sp}) \\cdot (1-\\pi)$, where $\\mathrm{Sp}$ is the test's specificity.\n\nWhen moving from operating point A to B, the increase in the proportion of true positives is:\n$$\n\\Delta P(TP) = (\\mathrm{Se}_{B} - \\mathrm{Se}_{A})\\pi = (0.90 - 0.80) \\times 0.01 = 0.10 \\times 0.01 = 0.001\n$$\nThe total increase in the referral rate is:\n$$\n\\Delta r = r_{B} - r_{A} = 0.08 - 0.04 = 0.04\n$$\nSince the increase in the overall referral rate ($\\Delta r = 0.04$) is substantially larger than the increase in the true positive rate ($\\Delta P(TP) = 0.001$), the difference must be accounted for by an increase in the false positive rate. Specifically, the change in the false positive proportion of the population is:\n$$\n\\Delta P(FP) = \\Delta r - \\Delta P(TP) = 0.04 - 0.001 = 0.039\n$$\nThis means that for every $1$ additional true case detected per $1000$ people, there are $39$ additional false positives. Optimizing the referral rate solely to maximize yield (true positives) ignores the substantial concurrent increase in false positives. False positives are harmful because they cause psychological distress and anxiety for the affected individuals, lead to costly and potentially invasive follow-up diagnostic procedures that carry their own risks, and place a significant unnecessary burden on healthcare resources. A rational screening policy must therefore balance the benefit of increased yield against the harm and cost of increased false positives.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Computation**\n\nThe objective is to calculate the change in the number of false positives, $\\Delta N_{FP}$, per $N=1000$ screened individuals when moving from operating point A to operating point B.\n\nA false positive occurs when an individual tests positive ($T^+$) but does not have the disease ($D^-$). The number of false positives, $N_{FP}$, in a screened population of size $N$ is:\n$$\nN_{FP} = N \\times P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nAs established from the law of total probability, the referral rate $r = P(T^+)$ can be decomposed as:\n$$\nr = P(T^+, D^+) + P(T^+, D^-)\n$$\nRearranging this equation allows us to express the probability of a false positive, $P(T^+, D^-)$, in terms of the referral rate and the probability of a true positive:\n$$\nP(T^+, D^-) = r - P(T^+, D^+)\n$$\nThe probability of a true positive is $P(T^+, D^+) = P(T^+|D^+)P(D^+) = \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi$. Substituting this into the equation for $P(T^+, D^-)$ gives:\n$$\nP(T^+, D^-) = r - \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi\n$$\nTherefore, the number of false positives for a given operating point is:\n$$\nN_{FP} = N \\times (r - \\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nWe can now calculate the number of false positives for operating points A and B.\nFor point A:\n$$\nN_{FP, A} = N \\times (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nFor point B:\n$$\nN_{FP, B} = N \\times (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi)\n$$\nThe change in the number of false positives when moving from A to B is $\\Delta N_{FP} = N_{FP, B} - N_{FP, A}$:\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = \\left[ N \\times (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi) \\right] - \\left[ N \\times (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = N \\times \\left[ (r_B - \\mathrm{Se}_B \\cdot \\pi) - (r_A - \\mathrm{Se}_A \\cdot \\pi) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = N \\times \\left[ (r_B - r_A) - (\\mathrm{Se}_B - \\mathrm{Se}_A) \\cdot \\pi \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $N=1000$, $\\pi=0.01$, $r_A=0.04$, $\\mathrm{Se}_A=0.80$, $r_B=0.08$, and $\\mathrm{Se}_B=0.90$.\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ (0.08 - 0.04) - (0.90 - 0.80) \\times 0.01 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ 0.04 - (0.10) \\times 0.01 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times \\left[ 0.04 - 0.001 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 1000 \\times [0.039]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta N_{FP} = 39\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. As an integer, $39$ can be written as $39.00$.\nThe expected change in the number of false positives is an increase of $39.00$ per $1000$ individuals screened.",
