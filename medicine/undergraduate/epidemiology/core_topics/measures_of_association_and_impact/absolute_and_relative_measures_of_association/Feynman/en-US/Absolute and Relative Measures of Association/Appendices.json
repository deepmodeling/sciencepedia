            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique and meaningful solution. It is a standard problem in introductory epidemiology and biostatistics. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\n### Part 1: First Principles, Definitions, and Confidence Interval Construction\n\nFrom first principles, **risk** is defined as the probability of a new event (e.g., disease onset) occurring within a specified time period among a population of individuals who are at risk at the beginning of the period.\n\nLet $R_1$ be the risk in the exposed group (solvent-exposed workers) and $R_0$ be the risk in the unexposed group. The point estimates for these risks, denoted $\\hat{R}_1$ and $\\hat{R}_0$, are calculated from the sample data:\n-   $a = 128$ is the number of incident cases in the exposed group.\n-   $n_1 = 6400$ is the total number of individuals in the exposed group.\n-   $c = 60$ is the number of incident cases in the unexposed group.\n-   $n_0 = 4800$ is the total number of individuals in the unexposed group.\n\nThe estimated risk in the exposed group is:\n$$ \\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} $$\nThe estimated risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$ \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} $$\nThe **risk ratio (RR)** is a relative measure of association that compares the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group. It is defined as:\n$$ RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} $$\nThe point estimate for the risk ratio, $\\widehat{RR}$, is calculated using the sample estimates of the risks:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{a/n_1}{c/n_0} $$\nFor large samples, the sampling distribution of $\\widehat{RR}$ is skewed. However, the sampling distribution of the natural logarithm of the risk ratio, $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$, is approximately normal. We therefore construct the confidence interval on the log scale and then transform the limits back to the original scale by exponentiation.\n\nThe variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ is derived from the variances of the individual risk estimates using the delta method. For a cohort study, the estimated variance of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$ is given by:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1-\\hat{R}_1}{a} + \\frac{1-\\hat{R}_0}{c} = \\frac{1 - a/n_1}{a} + \\frac{1-c/n_0}{c} $$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0} $$\nThe standard error, $\\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} - \\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{n_0}} $$\nA $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for $\\ln(RR)$ is constructed as:\n$$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) \\pm Z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha=0.05$, and the critical value from the standard normal distribution is $Z_{1-0.05/2} = Z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nThe limits for the $95\\%$ CI of $\\ln(RR)$ are:\n-   Lower Limit $(\\ln)$: $L_{\\ln} = \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$\n-   Upper Limit $(\\ln)$: $U_{\\ln} = \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$\n\nTo obtain the $95\\%$ CI for the risk ratio $RR$, we exponentiate these limits:\n-   Lower Confidence Limit (LCL): $LCL = \\exp(L_{\\ln}) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right) = \\widehat{RR} \\times \\exp\\left( -1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right)$\n-   Upper Confidence Limit (UCL): $UCL = \\exp(U_{\\ln}) = \\exp\\left( \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right) = \\widehat{RR} \\times \\exp\\left( 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) \\right)$\n\n### Part 2: Explanation of Log-Scale Transformation and Symmetry\n\nThe use of the natural logarithm scale for constructing the confidence interval is crucial for ratio measures like the RR. The confidence interval on the log scale, $[\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - E, \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + E]$ where $E = 1.96 \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}))$, is symmetric by construction. The margin of error, $E$, is added to and subtracted from the point estimate $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$.\n\nWhen we transform this interval back to the original risk ratio scale by exponentiation, the limits become $[\\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) - E), \\exp(\\ln(\\widehat{RR}) + E)]$. Using the properties of exponential functions, this interval is $[\\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{-E}, \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{E}]$, which can be written as $[\\widehat{RR} / e^E, \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^E]$.\n\nOn the original scale, this interval is not arithmetically symmetric around $\\widehat{RR}$. The distance from the point estimate to the upper limit is $\\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^E - \\widehat{RR} = \\widehat{RR}(e^E - 1)$, while the distance from the point estimate to the lower limit is $\\widehat{RR} - \\widehat{RR} \\cdot e^{-E} = \\widehat{RR}(1 - e^{-E})$. Since $e^E - 1 \\neq 1 - e^{-E}$ for any $E > 0$, the interval is arithmetically asymmetric.\n\nHowever, the interval is symmetric on a multiplicative (or ratio) scale. The upper limit is obtained by multiplying the point estimate by a factor of $e^E$, and the lower limit is obtained by dividing the point estimate by the same factor, $e^E$. That is:\n$$ \\frac{UCL}{\\widehat{RR}} = e^E \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\widehat{RR}}{LCL} = e^E $$\nThis multiplicative symmetry is conceptually appropriate for a ratio measure, as it implies that the uncertainty is proportional to the magnitude of the estimate. Furthermore, this structure ensures that the confidence interval for a risk ratio (which must be non-negative) will never include negative values. The point estimate $\\widehat{RR}$ is the geometric mean of the confidence limits, $\\widehat{RR} = \\sqrt{LCL \\times UCL}$, not the arithmetic mean.\n\n### Numerical Computations\n\nGiven the data: $a=128$, $n_1=6400$, $c=60$, $n_0=4800$.\n\n1.  **Calculate Risk Estimates:**\n    $$ \\hat{R}_1 = \\frac{128}{6400} = 0.02 $$\n    $$ \\hat{R}_0 = \\frac{60}{4800} = 0.0125 $$\n\n2.  **Calculate Point Estimate of RR:**\n    $$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{0.02}{0.0125} = 1.6 $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Standard Error of $\\ln(\\widehat{RR})$:**\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{128} - \\frac{1}{6400} + \\frac{1}{60} - \\frac{1}{4800}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.0078125 - 0.00015625 + 0.0166666\\overline{6} - 0.0002083\\overline{3}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.00765625 + 0.0164583\\overline{3}} $$\n    $$ \\widehat{SE}(\\ln(\\widehat{RR})) = \\sqrt{0.02411458\\overline{3}} \\approx 0.155288706 $$\n\n4.  **Construct 95% CI on Log Scale:**\n    $$ \\ln(\\widehat{RR}) = \\ln(1.6) \\approx 0.470003629 $$\n    Margin of error $E = 1.96 \\times 0.155288706 \\approx 0.304365864$.\n    $$ L_{\\ln} = 0.470003629 - 0.304365864 = 0.165637765 $$\n    $$ U_{\\ln} = 0.470003629 + 0.304365864 = 0.774369493 $$\n\n5.  **Transform CI to Original Scale:**\n    $$ LCL = \\exp(0.165637765) \\approx 1.180145 $$\n    $$ UCL = \\exp(0.774369493) \\approx 2.169190 $$\n\n6.  **Round to Four Significant Figures:**\n    -   Risk Ratio ($\\widehat{RR}$): $1.600$\n    -   Lower Confidence Limit (LCL): $1.180$\n    -   Upper Confidence Limit (UCL): $2.169$\n\nThe final result is a risk ratio of $1.600$ with a $95\\%$ confidence interval of ($1.180$, $2.169$). Since the interval does not contain the null value of $1.0$, the observed association is statistically significant at the $\\alpha=0.05$ level.",

The setup is a classic textbook example used to illustrate these principles. There are no scientific or factual violations.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is a quantitative, formalizable exercise in epidemiology, directly related to absolute and relative measures of association.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The data provided is complete and internally consistent.\n    - For stratum $S=H$, exposed: $180 + 720 = 900$. This matches the total $n_{1H}=900$.\n    - For stratum $S=H$, unexposed: $40 + 60 = 100$. This matches the total $n_{0H}=100$.\n    - For stratum $S=L$, exposed: $5 + 95 = 100$.

The definitions of risk and risk ratio are standard, and the data allows for a unique calculation. The question is precise.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem is not trivial; it requires careful calculation and a correct understanding of the distinction between confounding and non-collapsibility, which is a key concept in epidemiology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis requires calculating stratum-specific risk ratios and the crude risk ratio.\n\n**1. Definitions**\n- The risk of an outcome is the proportion of individuals in a group who experience the outcome. For a group of size $n$ with $k$ cases, the risk is $R = k/n$.\n- The Risk Ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group ($R_1$) to the risk in the unexposed group ($R_0$):\n  $$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{P(Y=1|E=1)}{P(Y=1|E=0)}$$\n\n**2. Stratum-Specific Risk Ratios**\n\n- **For Stratum $S=H$ (High Risk):**\n  - Risk in exposed ($E=1$): $R_{1H} = \\frac{180}{900} = 0.20$.\n  - Risk in unexposed ($E=0$): $R_{0H} = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.40$.\n  - Stratum-specific Risk Ratio:\n    $$RR_H = \\frac{R_{1H}}{R_{0H}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.40} = 0.50$$\n\n- **For Stratum $S=L$ (Low Risk):**\n  - Risk in exposed ($E=1$): $R_{1L} = \\frac{5}{100} = 0.05$.\n  - Risk in unexposed ($E=0$): $R_{0L} = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.10$.\n  - Stratum-specific Risk Ratio:\n    $$RR_L = \\frac{R_{1L}}{R_{0L}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.10} = 0.50$$\n\nWithin each stratum, the exposure appears to be protective, reducing the risk by $50\\%$. The stratum-specific risk ratios are homogeneous (equal), with $RR_H = RR_L = 0.50$.\n\n**3. Marginal (Crude) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo calculate the crude $RR$, we must first pool the data from both strata.\n\n- **Total Exposed Group ($E=1$):**\n  - Total subjects: $n_1 = n_{1H} + n_{1L} = 900 + 100 = 1000$.\n  - Total cases: $a = a_H + a_L = 180 + 5 = 185$.\n  - Marginal risk in exposed: $R_1 = \\frac{a}{n_1} = \\frac{185}{1000} = 0.185$.\n\n- **Total Unexposed Group ($E=0$):**\n  - Total subjects: $n_0 = n_{0H} + n_{0L} = 100 + 900 = 1000$.\n  - Total cases: $c = c_H + c_L = 40 + 90 = 130$.\n  - Marginal risk in unexposed: $R_0 = \\frac{c}{n_0} = \\frac{130}{1000} = 0.130$.\n\n- **Crude Risk Ratio:**\n  $$RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_1}{R_0} = \\frac{0.185}{0.130} \\approx 1.42307...$$\nThe crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$.\n\n**4. Interpretation: Confounding vs. Non-collapsibility**\n\nWe observe a reversal of association: the stratum-specific RRs are $0.50$ (protective), while the crude RR is $\\approx 1.42$ (harmful). This phenomenon is known as **Simpson's Paradox**. The task is to determine whether this is due to confounding or non-collapsibility.\n\n- **Confounding:** A variable $S$ is a confounder if it is associated with both the exposure $E$ and the outcome $Y$ (independent of $E$), and is not on the causal pathway from $E$ to $Y$.\n  - **Association between $S$ and $E$**:\n    - Proportion exposed in stratum $H$: $P(E=1|S=H) = \\frac{900}{900+100} = \\frac{900}{1000} = 0.9$.\n    - Proportion exposed in stratum $L$: $P(E=1|S=L) = \\frac{100}{100+900} = \\frac{100}{1000} = 0.1$.\n    - Since $P(E=1|S=H) \\neq P(E=1|S=L)$, $S$ is strongly associated with $E$.\n  - **Association between $S$ and $Y$ (among the unexposed)**:\n    - Risk in stratum $H$ (unexposed): $P(Y=1|S=H, E=0) = \\frac{40}{100} = 0.4$.\n    - Risk in stratum $L$ (unexposed): $P(Y=1|S=L, E=0) = \\frac{90}{900} = 0.1$.\n    - Since $P(Y=1|S=H, E=0) \\neq P(Y=1|S=L, E=0)$, $S$ is a risk factor for $Y$.\n  - The variable $S$ is a baseline risk factor, so it is not on the causal pathway.\n  - Since all conditions are met, **$S$ is a confounder**. The crude (marginal) association is distorted because the exposed group is disproportionately composed of high-risk individuals ($90\\%$ of exposed are in stratum $H$) while the unexposed group is disproportionately composed of low-risk individuals ($90\\%$ of unexposed are in stratum $L$). This creates a spurious harmful association in the crude analysis.\n\n- **Collapsibility:** This is a mathematical property of an effect measure. A measure is collapsible if the crude measure is a weighted average of the stratum-specific measures. More formally, a measure is collapsible if, for a constant stratum-specific measure, the crude measure will equal that common value if and only if the stratifying variable is not associated with the exposure.\n  - The **Risk Ratio ($RR$) is a collapsible measure**. When the stratum-specific RRs are constant (as they are here: $0.50$), any difference between this common value and the crude RR must be due to confounding (i.e., an association between the stratification variable and the exposure).\n  - The **Odds Ratio ($OR$) is non-collapsible**. For the OR, the crude measure can differ from a common stratum-specific measure even in the absence of confounding, simply as a mathematical consequence of the measure's non-linearity.\n\nIn this problem, the measure is the Risk Ratio. Because the RR is collapsible, the observed discrepancy between the adjusted ($0.50$) and crude ($\\approx 1.42$) values is entirely attributable to the confounding by $S$. It is not an issue of non-collapsibility.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n- **A. The stratum-specific $RR$s are each $0.50$, while the crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$; this is Simpson’s paradox driven by confounding by $S$, not by non-collapsibility.**\n  - Our calculations confirm the stratum-specific $RR$s are $0.50$ and the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$.\n  - The reversal of effect direction is indeed Simpson's paradox.\n  - Our analysis shows that $S$ is a strong confounder.\n  - The discrepancy is due to confounding because the Risk Ratio is a collapsible measure. The statement that it is *not* by non-collapsibility is correct.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. The stratum-specific $RR$s are each $0.50$, while the crude $RR$ is approximately $1.42$; this occurs because the risk ratio is non-collapsible.**\n  - The numerical values are correct.\n  - The interpretation is incorrect. The risk ratio is collapsible, not non-collapsible. The phenomenon is caused by confounding.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. The stratum-specific and crude $RR$s are all equal (approximately $0.50$); there is no Simpson’s paradox and no confounding.**\n  - This is factually incorrect. Our calculation shows the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$, which is not equal to $0.50$.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The stratum-specific $RR$s exceed $1$ in both strata, but the crude $RR$ is less than $1$; this reversal is due to confounding by $S$.**\n  - This states the numerical pattern in reverse. The stratum-specific $RR$s are $0.50$ (less than $1$) and the crude $RR$ is $\\approx 1.42$ (greater than $1$).\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. A reversal of direction for the risk ratio cannot occur; such reversals only occur for the odds ratio, so the pattern described is impossible for the risk ratio.**\n  - This is a false claim. Simpson's paradox, including a full reversal of the direction of association, can occur for the risk ratio, risk difference, and odds ratio. We have just demonstrated it for the risk ratio.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Let the subscript $i$ denote the stratum, where $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nThe fundamental definitions are:\n- Risk: $R = \\frac{A}{N}$\n- Odds: $Odds = \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{R}{1-R}$\n- Risk Difference (RD): $RD = R_E - R_U$\n- Risk Ratio (RR): $RR = \\frac{R_E}{R_U}$\n- Odds Ratio (OR): $OR = \\frac{A_E/B_E}{A_U/B_U} = \\frac{A_E B_U}{B_E A_U}$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Stratum $1$ ($18$–$39$ years):\n  - Exposed: $A_{E1} = 60$, $N_{E1} = 600$. Thus, $B_{E1} = 600 - 60 = 540$.\n  - Unexposed: $A_{U1} = 20$, $N_{U1} = 400$. Thus, $B_{U1} = 400 - 20 = 380$.\n  - Total in stratum $1$: $N_1 = 600 + 400 = 1000$.\n- Stratum $2$ ($40$–$65$ years):\n  - Exposed: $A_{E2} = 160$, $N_{E2} = 400$. Thus, $B_{E2} = 400 - 160 = 240$.\n  - Unexposed: $A_{U2} = 120$, $N_{U2} = 600$. Thus, $B_{U2} = 600 - 120 = 480$.\n  - Total in stratum $2$: $N_2 = 400 + 600 = 1000$.\n- External standard weights: $w_1 = 0.50$, $w_2 = 0.50$.\n\nFirst, we compute the stratum-specific measures.\n\nFor Stratum $1$:\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E1} = \\frac{A_{E1}}{N_{E1}} = \\frac{60}{600} = 0.10$\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{U1} = \\frac{A_{U1}}{N_{U1}} = \\frac{20}{400} = 0.05$\n- Stratum-specific Risk Difference: $RD_1 = R_{E1} - R_{U1} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05$\n- Stratum-specific Risk Ratio: $RR_1 = \\frac{R_{E1}}{R_{U1}} = \\frac{0.10}{0.05} = 2.0$\n- Stratum-specific Odds Ratio: $OR_1 = \\frac{A_{E1} B_{U1}}{B_{E1} A_{U1}} = \\frac{60 \\times 380}{540 \\times 20} = \\frac{22800}{10800} \\approx 2.111$\n\nFor Stratum $2$:\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{E2} = \\frac{A_{E2}}{N_{E2}} = \\frac{160}{400} = 0.40$\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{U2} = \\frac{A_{U2}}{N_{U2}} = \\frac{120}{600} = 0.20$\n- Stratum-specific Risk Difference: $RD_2 = R_{E2} - R_{U2} = 0.40 - 0.20 = 0.20$\n- Stratum-specific Risk Ratio: $RR_2 = \\frac{R_{E2}}{R_{U2}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.20} = 2.0$\n- Stratum-specific Odds Ratio: $OR_2 = \\frac{A_{E2} B_{U2}}{B_{E2} A_{U2}} = \\frac{160 \\times 480}{240 \\times 120} = \\frac{76800}{28800} \\approx 2.667$\n\nSecond, we compute the crude (unstratified) measures by collapsing the data into a single $2 \\times 2$ table.\n- Total exposed: $A_E = A_{E1} + A_{E2} = 60 + 160 = 220$; $N_E = N_{E1} + N_{E2} = 600 + 400 = 1000$. So, $B_E = 1000 - 220 = 780$.\n- Total unexposed: $A_U = A_{U1} + A_{U2} = 20 + 120 = 140$; $N_U = N_{U1} + N_{U2} = 400 + 600 = 1000$. So, $B_U = 1000 - 140 = 860$.\n\n- Crude risk in exposed: $R_{E,crude} = \\frac{A_E}{N_E} = \\frac{220}{1000} = 0.22$\n- Crude risk in unexposed: $R_{U,crude} = \\frac{A_U}{N_U} = \\frac{140}{1000} = 0.14$\n- Crude Risk Difference: $RD_{crude} = R_{E,crude} - R_{U,crude} = 0.22 - 0.14 = 0.08$\n- Crude Risk Ratio: $RR_{crude} = \\frac{R_{E,crude}}{R_{U,crude}} = \\frac{0.22}{0.14} \\approx 1.571$\n- Crude Odds Ratio: $OR_{crude} = \\frac{A_E B_U}{B_E A_U} = \\frac{220 \\times 860}{780 \\times 140} = \\frac{189200}{109200} \\approx 1.733$\n\nThird, we compute the directly standardized measures using the external weights $w_1=0.50$ and $w_2=0.50$.\n- Standardized risk in exposed: $R_{E,adj} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i R_{Ei} = w_1 R_{E1} + w_2 R_{E2} = (0.50 \\times 0.10) + (0.50 \\times 0.40) = 0.05 + 0.20 = 0.25$\n- Standardized risk in unexposed: $R_{U,adj} = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_i R_{Ui} = w_1 R_{U1} + w_2 R_{U2} = (0.50 \\times 0.05) + (0.50 \\times 0.20) = 0.025 + 0.10 = 0.125$\n- Standardized Risk Difference: $RD_{adj} = R_{E,adj} - R_{U,adj} = 0.25 - 0.125 = 0.125$\n- Standardized Risk Ratio: $RR_{adj} = \\frac{R_{E,adj}}{R_{U,adj}} = \\frac{0.25}{0.125} = 2.0$\n\nFourth, we compute the adjusted Odds Ratio using the Mantel-Haenszel (M-H) estimator.\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{A_{Ei} B_{Ui}}{N_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{B_{Ei} A_{Ui}}{N_i}} = \\frac{\\frac{60 \\times 380}{1000} + \\frac{160 \\times 480}{1000}}{\\frac{540 \\times 20}{1000} + \\frac{240 \\times 120}{1000}} = \\frac{22.8 + 76.8}{10.8 + 28.8} = \\frac{99.6}{39.6} \\approx 2.515$$\n\nFinally, we analyze the source of discrepancies.\nThe crude risk ratio, $RR_{crude} \\approx 1.57$, is substantially different from the adjusted risk ratio, $RR_{adj} = 2.0$. This discrepancy is due to confounding by age. For confounding to be present, the variable (age) must be associated with both the exposure (Solvent Y) and the outcome (asthma).\n$1$. Association between age and exposure: The proportion of exposed workers is $600/1000 = 0.60$ in the younger stratum ($1$), but only $400/1000 = 0.40$ in the older stratum ($2$). Thus, age is associated with exposure.\n$2$. Association between age and outcome: The risk of asthma in the unexposed group (the background risk) is $0.05$ in the younger stratum but $0.20$ in the older stratum. Thus, age is a risk factor for asthma.\nSince age is associated with both exposure and outcome, it is a confounder. In this case, younger workers (lower baseline risk) are more likely to be exposed, while older workers (higher baseline risk) are more likely to be unexposed. This imbalance distorts the crude comparison, biasing the crude RR towards the null value of $1$. The crude RR ($1.57$) is an underestimate of the true association ($2.0$).\n\nThe problem also demonstrates effect measure modification (interaction).\n- On the risk ratio (multiplicative) scale, the effect is uniform: $RR_1 = 2.0$ and $RR_2 = 2.0$. There is no effect modification for the RR.\n- On the risk difference (additive) scale, the effect is not uniform: $RD_1 = 0.05$ while $RD_2 = 0.20$. This indicates that the absolute increase in risk due to exposure is four times larger in the older stratum.\n- On the odds ratio scale, the effect is also not uniform: $OR_1 \\approx 2.11$ while $OR_2 \\approx 2.67$.\n\nThis pattern, where the RR is constant but the RD and OR vary, is a mathematical consequence of the measures' definitions when the baseline risk ($R_U$) varies across strata. Specifically, $RD_i = RR_i \\cdot R_{Ui} - R_{Ui} = (RR_i - 1)R_{Ui}$. Since $RR_i$ is constant ($RR=2$) and $R_{Ui}$ increases with age, $RD_i$ must also increase. Similarly, $OR_i = RR_i \\frac{1-R_{Ui}}{1-R_{Ei}} = RR \\frac{1-R_{Ui}}{1-RR \\cdot R_{Ui}}$. Since $R_{Ui}$ varies, $OR_i$ must also vary.\n\nWeighting and standardization correct for confounding. The crude RR is a ratio of weighted averages of stratum-specific risks, where the weights are different for the exposed and unexposed groups, reflecting the confounded study population structure:\n$$RR_{crude} = \\frac{ ( N_{E1}/N_E ) R_{E1} + ( N_{E2}/N_E ) R_{E2} }{ ( N_{U1}/N_U ) R_{U1} + ( N_{U2}/N_U ) R_{U2} } = \\frac{ (0.6) R_{E1} + (0.4) R_{E2} }{ (0.4) R_{U1} + (0.6) R_{U2} } \\approx 1.57$$\nDirect standardization applies a common set of weights ($w_1=0.5, w_2=0.5$) to the stratum-specific risks of both the exposed and unexposed groups, creating a summary measure for a hypothetical population with that standard age distribution. This removes the confounding.\n$$RR_{adj} = \\frac{ w_1 R_{E1} + w_2 R_{E2} }{ w_1 R_{U1} + w_2 R_{U2} } = \\frac{ 0.5 R_{E1} + 0.5 R_{E2} }{ 0.5 R_{U1} + 0.5 R_{U2} }$$\nBecause there is no effect modification on the RR scale ($R_{E1} = 2.0 \\cdot R_{U1}$ and $R_{E2} = 2.0 \\cdot R_{U2}$), this simplifies to:\n$$RR_{adj} = \\frac{ 0.5 (2.0 \\cdot R_{U1}) + 0.5 (2.0 \\cdot R_{U2}) }{ 0.5 R_{U1} + 0.5 R_{U2} } = \\frac{ 2.0 (0.5 R_{U1} + 0.5 R_{U2}) }{ 0.5 R_{U1} + 0.5 R_{U2} } = 2.0$$\nThe adjusted RD ($0.125$) and adjusted OR ($2.52$) are also summary measures, representing weighted averages of their respective stratum-specific values. Since there is effect modification on these scales, their values depend on the chosen weighting scheme (e.g., standard population for RD, M-H weights for OR) and represent an average effect, which obscures the stratum-specific differences.\n\nThe final question asks for the directly standardized risk ratio, which we have computed to be exactly $2.0$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $2.000$.",
