            "problem": "An investigator studies a binary health outcome $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ over one year in relation to a binary exposure $A \\in \\{0,1\\}$, with a categorical stratification variable $Z$ taking $3$ disjoint values $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Standardized Risk Difference\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the population-level risk difference standardized to the overall population distribution of the stratification variable $Z$. We are given that the outcome $Y$ and exposure $A$ are binary, $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ and $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The risk of the outcome for a given exposure level $a$ and stratum $z$ is the conditional expectation $E[Y \\mid A=a, Z=z]$. For brevity, let's denote this as $R(a, z)$.\n\nStandardization is a method to compute a summary measure of association that would be observed in a target population if it had the same stratum-specific risks as the study population but the stratum distribution of the target population. In this problem, the target population is the overall study population itself, for which the distribution of $Z$ is given by the prevalences $P(Z=z)$.\n\nThe standardized risk for the exposed group ($A=1$), denoted $R_{1}^{\\text{std}}$, is the expected risk if the entire population were exposed. This is calculated by taking the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks among the exposed, $R(1, z)$, where the weights are the prevalences of the strata, $P(Z=z)$. This is a direct application of the law of total expectation, where we average the conditional expectations over the distribution of the conditioning variable:\n$$ R_{1}^{\\text{std}} = E_{\\text{std}}[Y \\mid A=1] = \\sum_{z} E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z] P(Z=z) = \\sum_{z} R(1, z) P(Z=z) $$\n\nSimilarly, the standardized risk for the unexposed group ($A=0$), denoted $R_{0}^{\\text{std}}$, is the expected risk if the entire population were unexposed. This is the weighted average of the stratum-specific risks among the unexposed, $R(0, z)$:\n$$ R_{0}^{\\text{std}} = E_{\\text{std}}[Y \\mid A=0] = \\sum_{z} E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z] P(Z=z) = \\sum_{z} R(0, z) P(Z=z) $$\n\nThe standardized population risk difference, which we denote as $\\text{SRD}$, is the difference between these two standardized risks:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = R_{1}^{\\text{std}} - R_{0}^{\\text{std}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_{1}^{\\text{std}}$ and $R_{0}^{\\text{std}}$:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\left( \\sum_{z} R(1, z) P(Z=z) \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{z} R(0, z) P(Z=z) \\right) $$\n\nBy the linearity of summation, we can combine the two sums:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\left( R(1, z) P(Z=z) - R(0, z) P(Z=z) \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $P(Z=z)$:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\left( R(1, z) - R(0, z) \\right) P(Z=z) $$\n\nThe term inside the parentheses is precisely the definition of the stratum-specific risk difference provided in the problem statement: $\\text{RD}(z) = E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z] - E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z] = R(1, z) - R(0, z)$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the standardized risk difference is:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\sum_{z} \\text{RD}(z) P(Z=z) $$\nThis expression clarifies that the standardized population risk difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences, where the weights are the prevalences of the respective strata in the target population (here, the overall population).\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Standardized Risk Difference\n\nWe now apply this derived formula to the provided data. The categorical variable $Z$ has $3$ levels: $z_{1}, z_{2}, z_{3}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the stratum-specific risk differences, $\\text{RD}(z)$, for each stratum.\nFor stratum $z_{1}$:\n$$ \\text{RD}(z_{1}) = E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z_{1}] - E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z_{1}] = 0.18 - 0.12 = 0.06 $$\nFor stratum $z_{2}$:\n$$ \\text{RD}(z_{2}) = E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z_{2}] - E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z_{2}] = 0.10 - 0.06 = 0.04 $$\nFor stratum $z_{3}$:\n$$ \\text{RD}(z_{3}) = E[Y \\mid A=1, Z=z_{3}] - E[Y \\mid A=0, Z=z_{3}] = 0.25 - 0.20 = 0.05 $$\n\nThe prevalences of the strata are given as:\n$P(Z=z_{1}) = 0.5$\n$P(Z=z_{2}) = 0.3$\n$P(Z=z_{3}) = 0.2$\nNote that $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(Z=z_i) = 0.5 + 0.3 + 0.2 = 1.0$, as required for a probability distribution.\n\nUsing the derived formula for the standardized risk difference:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = \\text{RD}(z_{1})P(Z=z_{1}) + \\text{RD}(z_{2})P(Z=z_{2}) + \\text{RD}(z_{3})P(Z=z_{3}) $$\nSubstitute the calculated values:\n$$ \\text{SRD} = (0.06)(0.5) + (0.04)(0.3) + (0.05)(0.2) $$\n$$ \\text{SRD} = 0.030 + 0.012 + 0.010 $$\n$$ \\text{SRD} = 0.052 $$\n\nThe standardized population risk difference is $0.052$.",

However, the crude risk ratio ($RR_{crude} \\approx 3.36$) indicates a strong harmful effect. This reversal in the direction of the association is a classic demonstration of Simpson's paradox. The paradox arises because $Z$ is a confounder: it is associated with the exposure ($P(Z=1 \\mid E=1) \\neq P(Z=1 \\mid E=0)$) and is an independent risk factor for the outcome (the risks in stratum $Z=1$ are much higher than in $Z=2$). The crude analysis is misleading because the exposed group is disproportionately composed of individuals from the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$), while the unexposed group is primarily from the low-risk stratum ($Z=2$).\n\n3) Computation of population-standardized RD.\n\nTo compute the standardized risk difference, we first calculate the standardized risks for the exposed and unexposed. This is done by applying the stratum-specific risks to a common, standard population structure, given by $P(Z=1) = 0.30$ and $P(Z=2) = 0.70$.\n\nStandardized risk if the entire population were exposed ($E=1$):\n$$R_{std, E=1} = \\sum_{z=1}^{2} P(Y=1 \\mid E=1, Z=z)P(Z=z)$$\n$$R_{std, E=1} = R_{11}P(Z=1) + R_{12}P(Z=2)$$\n$$R_{std, E=1} = (0.30)(0.30) + (0.02)(0.70) = 0.090 + 0.014 = 0.104$$\n\nStandardized risk if the entire population were unexposed ($E=0$):\n$$R_{std, E=0} = \\sum_{z=1}^{2} P(Y=1 \\mid E=0, Z=z)P(Z=z)$$\n$$R_{std, E=0} = R_{01}P(Z=1) + R_{02}P(Z=2)$$\n$$R_{std, E=0} = (0.40)(0.30) + (0.05)(0.70) = 0.120 + 0.035 = 0.155$$\n\nThe population-standardized risk difference ($RD_{std}$) is the difference between these two standardized risks:\n$$RD_{std} = R_{std, E=1} - R_{std, E=0} = 0.104 - 0.155 = -0.051$$\nA reversal of direction does not occur under standardization on the additive scale. This can be shown by rearranging the formula for $RD_{std}$:\n$$RD_{std} = \\left( R_{11}P(Z=1) + R_{12}P(Z=2) \\right) - \\left( R_{01}P(Z=1) + R_{02}P(Z=2) \\right)$$\n$$RD_{std} = (R_{11} - R_{01})P(Z=1) + (R_{12} - R_{02})P(Z=2)$$\n$$RD_{std} = RD_1 P(Z=1) + RD_2 P(Z=2)$$\nThis shows that the standardized risk difference is a weighted average of the stratum-specific risk differences, where the weights ($P(Z=1)$ and $P(Z=2)$) are non-negative. Since both stratum-specific RDs were negative ($RD_1=-0.10$ and $RD_2=-0.03$), their weighted average must also be negative. The standardized measure must lie between the stratum-specific measures. In this case, $-0.10 \\le -0.051 \\le -0.03$. Therefore, a reversal of sign is mathematically impossible for the risk difference when standardizing, assuming no qualitative interaction across strata (i.e., all stratum-specific RDs have the same sign). The calculated value $RD_{std} = -0.051$ correctly reflects the protective effect seen within each stratum.\nThe numerical value requested is the population-standardized RD, which is $-0.051$. Expressed to four significant figures, this is $-0.05100$.",

Rounding to four significant figures gives $1.659$.\n\n### Step 3: Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe observation that $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A} + \\mathrm{PAF}_{B} \\approx 1.659 > 1$ does not violate any mathematical or probabilistic laws. This phenomenon arises from the synergistic interaction between exposures $A$ and $B$.\n\nA Population Attributable Fraction ($\\mathrm{PAF}$) is not a measure of the proportion of cases exclusively *caused* by an exposure, but rather the proportion of cases that would be *averted* if the exposure were removed from the population. The key to understanding the sum is to recognize that the sets of cases averted by eliminating $A$ and by eliminating $B$ are not mutually exclusive.\n\nThe data clearly demonstrates strong positive interaction (synergy) on the additive scale. The baseline risk (no exposures) is $r_{00}=0.01$. The risk added by $A$ alone is $r_{10} - r_{00} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$. The risk added by $B$ alone is $r_{01} - r_{00} = 0.02 - 0.01 = 0.01$. If the effects were simply additive, the risk with both exposures would be expected to be $r_{00} + (r_{10} - r_{00}) + (r_{01} - r_{00}) = 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 = 0.03$. However, the actual risk is $r_{11} = 0.20$, which is substantially higher. The excess risk, $r_{11} - (r_{10} + r_{01} - r_{00}) = 0.20 - (0.02 + 0.02 - 0.01) = 0.17$, is due to the synergistic interaction between $A$ and $B$.\n\nConsider the cases that occur only because both $A$ and $B$ are present—the \"interaction cases.\"\n- When we calculate $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A}$, we are calculating the proportion of cases that would be prevented if $A$ were eliminated. Eliminating $A$ would prevent cases caused by $A$ alone, and it would also prevent the interaction cases, since the interaction cannot occur without $A$.\n- When we calculate $\\mathrm{PAF}_{B}$, we are calculating the proportion of cases that would be prevented if $B$ were eliminated. Eliminating $B$ would prevent cases caused by $B$ alone, and it would also prevent the same interaction cases, since the interaction cannot occur without $B$.\n\nTherefore, the disease burden attributable to the synergistic interaction is counted in the numerator of $\\mathrm{PAF}_{A}$ *and* in the numerator of $\\mathrm{PAF}_{B}$. This \"double counting\" of the jointly determined cases is why the sum of the PAFs can exceed $1$ (or $100\\%$). It reflects the fact that for a substantial portion of the disease burden (the interaction cases), there are two distinct, sufficient interventions (eliminating $A$ or eliminating $B$) that would lead to their prevention. The sum exceeding $1$ is a hallmark of positive interaction between risk factors. It does not imply a logical contradiction but rather highlights the overlapping causal responsibility for disease in the population.",
