This exercise provides a powerful hands-on demonstration of this principle through a classic case of Simpson's paradox, where the association observed in an entire population is reversed within its subgroups.

            "problem": "A cohort study investigates the effect of a binary exposure $E$ (treatment) on a binary outcome $Y$ (death within $30$ days), with a suspected confounder $S$ (baseline severity) taking two levels: low severity ($S=\\text{L}$) and high severity ($S=\\text{H}$). The following stratified data are observed:\n\n- In the low-severity stratum $S=\\text{L}$:\n  - Exposed: $1$ outcome among $10$ exposed individuals.\n  - Unexposed: $45$ outcomes among $300$ unexposed individuals.\n\n- In the high-severity stratum $S=\\text{H}$:\n  - Exposed: $400$ outcomes among $800$ exposed individuals.\n  - Unexposed: $90$ outcomes among $150$ unexposed individuals.\n\nUsing only core definitions from epidemiology, do the following:\n- Compute the stratum-specific risk ratios for $E$ versus $\\neg E$ within $S=\\text{L}$ and within $S=\\text{H}$.\n- Compute the crude (aggregated over $S$) risk ratio for $E$ versus $\\neg E$ by combining counts across the two strata.\n- Based on these calculations, explain whether this dataset exhibits Simpson’s paradox and interpret the bias mechanism in terms of confounding by $S$ and the distribution of $S$ across $E$.\n\nReport as your final numerical answer the crude risk ratio computed by aggregating over $S$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of epidemiological data from a cohort study to assess the effect of an exposure $E$ on an outcome $Y$, considering a potential confounder $S$. The analysis involves computing stratum-specific and crude risk ratios and interpreting the results in the context of confounding and Simpson's paradox.\n\nLet $E=1$ denote exposure and $E=0$ denote non-exposure. Let $Y=1$ denote an outcome (death) and $Y=0$ denote no outcome. Let $S \\in \\{\\text{L}, \\text{H}\\}$ denote the stratum, with $S=\\text{L}$ for low severity and $S=\\text{H}$ for high severity.\n\nThe risk of an outcome is defined as the conditional probability of the outcome given the exposure status and stratum: $R = P(Y=1 | E, S)$. The risk ratio ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n$$\nRR = \\frac{P(Y=1 | E=1, S)}{P(Y=1 | E=0, S)}\n$$\n\nFirst, we will compute the stratum-specific risk ratios.\n\n**1. Stratum-Specific Risk Ratios**\n\nFor the low-severity stratum, $S=\\text{L}$:\n- The risk among the exposed is $R_{E|S=\\text{L}} = P(Y=1|E=1, S=\\text{L})$. The data provide $1$ outcome among $10$ exposed individuals.\n$$R_{E|S=\\text{L}} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1$$\n- The risk among the unexposed is $R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{L}} = P(Y=1|E=0, S=\\text{L})$. The data provide $45$ outcomes among $300$ unexposed individuals.\n$$R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{L}} = \\frac{45}{300} = \\frac{15}{100} = 0.15$$\n- The stratum-specific risk ratio for the low-severity group is:\n$$RR_{S=\\text{L}} = \\frac{R_{E|S=\\text{L}}}{R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{L}}} = \\frac{0.1}{0.15} = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667$$\n\nFor the high-severity stratum, $S=\\text{H}$:\n- The risk among the exposed is $R_{E|S=\\text{H}} = P(Y=1|E=1, S=\\text{H})$. The data provide $400$ outcomes among $800$ exposed individuals.\n$$R_{E|S=\\text{H}} = \\frac{400}{800} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n- The risk among the unexposed is $R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{H}} = P(Y=1|E=0, S=\\text{H})$. The data provide $90$ outcomes among $150$ unexposed individuals.\n$$R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{H}} = \\frac{90}{150} = \\frac{9}{15} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$\n- The stratum-specific risk ratio for the high-severity group is:\n$$RR_{S=\\text{H}} = \\frac{R_{E|S=\\text{H}}}{R_{\\neg E|S=\\text{H}}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833$$\n\nIn both strata, the risk ratio is less than $1$, suggesting that the exposure $E$ is protective.\n\n**2. Crude (Aggregated) Risk Ratio**\n\nTo compute the crude risk ratio, we first aggregate the counts across both strata.\n- Total number of exposed individuals: $N_E = 10 + 800 = 810$.\n- Total number of outcomes among the exposed: $O_E = 1 + 400 = 401$.\n- Total number of unexposed individuals: $N_{\\neg E} = 300 + 150 = 450$.\n- Total number of outcomes among the unexposed: $O_{\\neg E} = 45 + 90 = 135$.\n\nThe crude risk in the exposed group is:\n$$R_{E,\\text{crude}} = \\frac{O_E}{N_E} = \\frac{401}{810}$$\nThe crude risk in the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{\\neg E,\\text{crude}} = \\frac{O_{\\neg E}}{N_{\\neg E}} = \\frac{135}{450} = \\frac{13.5}{45} = \\frac{27}{90} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3$$\nThe crude risk ratio is:\n$$RR_{\\text{crude}} = \\frac{R_{E,\\text{crude}}}{R_{\\neg E,\\text{crude}}} = \\frac{401/810}{0.3} = \\frac{401}{810 \\times 0.3} = \\frac{401}{243}$$\n$$RR_{\\text{crude}} \\approx 1.65020576...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the crude risk ratio is $1.650$.\n\n**3. Interpretation: Simpson's Paradox and Confounding**\n\nThe analysis reveals a stark contradiction. The stratum-specific risk ratios ($RR_{S=\\text{L}} \\approx 0.667$ and $RR_{S=\\text{H}} \\approx 0.833$) both indicate that the exposure is protective (i.e., reduces the risk of death). However, the crude risk ratio ($RR_{\\text{crude}} \\approx 1.650$) suggests that the exposure is harmful (i.e., increases the risk of death). This reversal of the direction of association when a lurking variable is ignored is a classic example of **Simpson's paradox**.\n\nThe paradox arises due to confounding by the variable $S$ (baseline severity). For a variable to be a confounder, it must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome.\n\na) **Association between confounder ($S$) and exposure ($E$):**\nWe examine the distribution of severity levels within the exposed and unexposed groups.\n- Proportion of high-severity individuals among the exposed:\n$$P(S=\\text{H}|E=1) = \\frac{800}{10+800} = \\frac{800}{810} \\approx 0.988$$\n- Proportion of high-severity individuals among the unexposed:\n$$P(S=\\text{H}|E=0) = \\frac{150}{300+150} = \\frac{150}{450} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$$\nThere is a strong association. Exposed individuals are far more likely to have high baseline severity. This indicates that the treatment (exposure) was not assigned randomly but was preferentially given to sicker patients, a phenomenon known as confounding by indication.\n\nb) **Association between confounder ($S$) and outcome ($Y$):**\nWe examine if severity is an independent risk factor for the outcome. We can check this within the unexposed group to see the effect of $S$ without influence from $E$.\n- Risk of outcome in high-severity unexposed: $P(Y=1|E=0, S=\\text{H}) = 0.6$.\n- Risk of outcome in low-severity unexposed: $P(Y=1|E=0, S=\\text{L}) = 0.15$.\nThe risk of death is $4$ times higher in the high-severity group than in the low-severity group ($0.6/0.15=4$), confirming that $S$ is a strong risk factor for the outcome $Y$.\n\n**Conclusion on bias mechanism:**\nThe crude risk ratio is severely biased because it compares two groups that are fundamentally different in their baseline risk. The \"exposed\" group is disproportionately composed of high-severity patients (a high-risk group), while the \"unexposed\" group has a much larger proportion of low-severity patients (a low-risk group). The crude analysis incorrectly attributes the higher death rate in the exposed group to the exposure itself, when in fact it is driven by the underlying high severity of the patients receiving the treatment. The stratified analysis controls for this confounding by comparing exposed and unexposed individuals of similar severity. This reveals the true, protective effect of the exposure within each stratum. The crude risk ratio is a misleading, confounded estimate, whereas the stratum-specific risk ratios provide a more valid measure of the exposure's effect.",

            "solution": "### Solution\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Marginal Association between $A$ and $Y$ in the Source Population**\n\nWe are given that the exposure $A$ and outcome $Y$ are independent in the source population. We will verify this and compute the marginal odds ratio. By the definition of independence, the conditional probability of $Y$ given $A$ is equal to the marginal probability of $Y$.\n\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid A=1) = P(Y=1) = 0.2$$\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid A=0) = P(Y=1) = 0.2$$\n\nThis confirms that the risk of the outcome is the same regardless of exposure status, indicating no association.\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group. First, we compute the odds for each group.\n\nThe odds of $Y=1$ given $A=1$ is:\n$$Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=1) = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid A=1)}{P(Y=0 \\mid A=1)} = \\frac{0.2}{1 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = 0.25$$\n\nThe odds of $Y=1$ given $A=0$ is:\n$$Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=0) = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid A=0)}{P(Y=0 \\mid A=0)} = \\frac{0.2}{1 - 0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.8} = 0.25$$\n\nThe marginal odds ratio, $OR_{AY}$, is the ratio of these odds:\n$$OR_{AY} = \\frac{Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=1)}{Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=0)} = \\frac{0.25}{0.25} = 1$$\n\nAn odds ratio of $1$ signifies no association between $A$ and $Y$ in the source population, which is consistent with their independence.\n\n**2. Conditional Association between $A$ and $Y$ within the Stratum $C=1$**\n\nTo compute the odds ratio of $Y$ with respect to $A$ conditional on $C=1$, we must first compute the conditional probabilities $P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1)$ and $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1)$. We use Bayes' theorem for this purpose.\n\nThe general form of the required conditional probability is:\n$$P(Y=y \\mid A=a, C=1) = \\frac{P(C=1 \\mid Y=y, A=a) P(Y=y \\mid A=a)}{P(C=1 \\mid A=a)}$$\nSince $A$ and $Y$ are marginally independent, $P(Y=y \\mid A=a) = P(Y=y)$. The denominator is found using the law of total probability, summing over the states of $Y$:\n$$P(C=1 \\mid A=a) = \\sum_{y \\in \\{0,1\\}} P(C=1 \\mid Y=y, A=a) P(Y=y)$$\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary terms for the stratum $A=1$:\n$$P(C=1 \\mid A=1) = P(C=1 \\mid Y=0, A=1)P(Y=0) + P(C=1 \\mid Y=1, A=1)P(Y=1)$$\n$$P(C=1 \\mid A=1) = (0.20)(0.8) + (0.50)(0.2) = 0.16 + 0.10 = 0.26$$\nNow we can compute $P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1)$:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1) = \\frac{P(C=1 \\mid Y=1, A=1)P(Y=1)}{P(C=1 \\mid A=1)} = \\frac{(0.50)(0.2)}{0.26} = \\frac{0.10}{0.26} = \\frac{5}{13}$$\n\nNext, we compute the analogous terms for the stratum $A=0$:\n$$P(C=1 \\mid A=0) = P(C=1 \\mid Y=0, A=0)P(Y=0) + P(C=1 \\mid Y=1, A=0)P(Y=1)$$\n$$P(C=1 \\mid A=0) = (0.05)(0.8) + (0.25)(0.2) = 0.04 + 0.05 = 0.09$$\nNow we can compute $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1)$:\n$$P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1) = \\frac{P(C=1 \\mid Y=1, A=0)P(Y=1)}{P(C=1 \\mid A=0)} = \\frac{(0.25)(0.2)}{0.09} = \\frac{0.05}{0.09} = \\frac{5}{9}$$\n\nWith these conditional probabilities, we can compute the odds ratio conditional on $C=1$, denoted $OR_{AY \\mid C=1}$.\nFirst, the odds of $Y=1$ given $A=1$ and $C=1$:\n$$Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1) = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1)}{P(Y=0 \\mid A=1, C=1)} = \\frac{5/13}{1 - 5/13} = \\frac{5/13}{8/13} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\n\nSecond, the odds of $Y=1$ given $A=0$ and $C=1$:\n$$Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1) = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1)}{P(Y=0 \\mid A=0, C=1)} = \\frac{5/9}{1 - 5/9} = \\frac{5/9}{4/9} = \\frac{5}{4}$$\n\nFinally, the conditional odds ratio is the ratio of these odds:\n$$OR_{AY \\mid C=1} = \\frac{Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1)}{Odds(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1)} = \\frac{5/8}{5/4} = \\frac{5}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{20}{40} = 0.5$$\n\n**3. Qualitative Explanation of the Change in Association**\n\nThe change from no association ($OR_{AY} = 1$) in the overall population to an inverse association ($OR_{AY \\mid C=1} = 0.5$) within the subpopulation of clinic attendees ($C=1$) is a classic example of **collider stratification bias**, also known as selection bias.\n\nThe causal structure is represented by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) as $A \\rightarrow C \\leftarrow Y$. In this graph, $C$ is a **collider** because it has two arrows pointing into it from $A$ and $Y$. In the source population, $A$ and $Y$ are independent because the path between them is blocked by this collider. There is no open, non-causal path creating a statistical association.\n\nHowever, when we **condition on the collider** by restricting our analysis to the stratum where $C=1$ (i.e., only clinic attendees), we open the previously blocked path. This creates a spurious, non-causal statistical association between $A$ and $Y$.\n\nIn this specific problem, both the exposure ($A=1$) and the outcome ($Y=1$) increase the probability of clinic attendance ($C=1$). This leads to a phenomenon known as \"explaining away\". Within the group of clinic attendees ($C=1$), if we observe that a person has the exposure ($A=1$), the exposure itself provides an explanation for why they are in the clinic. This makes the other potential cause, the outcome ($Y=1$), less likely as an explanation for their presence. Conversely, if a clinic attendee is unexposed ($A=0$), the absence of this cause makes it more probable that the other cause ($Y=1$) must be present to explain their attendance.\n\nThis is reflected in our calculations: the probability of the outcome is lower among the exposed compared to the unexposed *within the clinic population* ($P(Y=1 \\mid A=1, C=1) \\approx 0.385$ vs. $P(Y=1 \\mid A=0, C=1) \\approx 0.556$). This induced inverse association ($OR_{AY \\mid C=1} = 0.5$) is an artifact of the selection process (stratifying on $C$) and does not represent a true causal effect of $A$ on $Y$.",
