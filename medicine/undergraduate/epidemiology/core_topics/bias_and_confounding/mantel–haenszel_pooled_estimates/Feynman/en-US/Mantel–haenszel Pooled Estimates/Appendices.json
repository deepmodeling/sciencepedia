            "problem": "Consider a cohort study of an exposure $E$ and a binary outcome $D$, with a binary stratification variable $Z$ that is suspected to confound the $E$–$D$ association. The population is divided into $2$ strata: $Z=0$ (low baseline risk) and $Z=1$ (high baseline risk). Within each stratum, the following $2 \\times 2$ counts are observed:\n\nFor $Z=0$: among the exposed, $a_{0} = 5$ cases ($D=1$) and $b_{0} = 15$ non-cases ($D=0$); among the unexposed, $c_{0} = 10$ cases and $d_{0} = 90$ non-cases.\n\nFor $Z=1$: among the exposed, $a_{1} = 60$ cases and $b_{1} = 30$ non-cases; among the unexposed, $c_{1} = 40$ cases and $d_{1} = 60$ non-cases.\n\nUsing only core definitions of odds and odds ratio, first compute the marginal (crude) odds ratio between $E$ and $D$ ignoring $Z$.

This can distort the marginal association between $E$ and $D$. Let's examine if $Z$ meets the criteria for a confounder in this dataset.\n\n1.  **Association between $Z$ and $D$:** $Z$ must be a risk factor for the outcome $D$. We can check this by comparing the risk (or odds) of disease across the strata of $Z$, holding exposure constant (e.g., among the unexposed).\n    - Odds of disease in stratum $Z=0$ (low risk), among unexposed: $\\frac{c_{0}}{d_{0}} = \\frac{10}{90} = \\frac{1}{9}$\n    - Odds of disease in stratum $Z=1$ (high risk), among unexposed: $\\frac{c_{1}}{d_{1}} = \\frac{40}{60} = \\frac{2}{3}$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{9} \\neq \\frac{2}{3}$, $Z$ is associated with the outcome $D$. The baseline odds of disease are higher in the $Z=1$ stratum.\n\n2.  **Association between $Z$ and $E$:** The distribution of the exposure $E$ must differ across the strata of $Z$.\n    - Proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=0$: $P(E=1|Z=0) = \\frac{a_{0}+b_{0}}{a_{0}+b_{0}+c_{0}+d_{0}} = \\frac{5+15}{120} = \\frac{20}{120} = \\frac{1}{6}$\n    - Proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=1$: $P(E=1|Z=1) = \\frac{a_{1}+b_{1}}{a_{1}+b_{1}+c_{1}+d_{1}} = \\frac{60+30}{190} = \\frac{90}{190} = \\frac{9}{19}$\n    Since $\\frac{1}{6} \\neq \\frac{9}{19}$, the exposure is not distributed equally across the strata of $Z$. Specifically, exposed individuals are more prevalent in the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$).\n\nBecause $Z$ is associated with both $D$ and $E$, it is a confounder. The marginal odds ratio is a distorted measure of the $E-D$ association. To see the undistorted association, we compute the odds ratio within each stratum.\n\n- Stratum $Z=0$: $OR_{0} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{b_{0}c_{0}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 90}{15 \\cdot 10} = \\frac{450}{150} = 3$\n- Stratum $Z=1$: $OR_{1} = \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{b_{1}c_{1}} = \\frac{60 \\cdot 60}{30 \\cdot 40} = \\frac{3600}{1200} = 3$\n\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are both equal to $3$. This common value represents the association between $E$ and $D$ after controlling for $Z$. The crude odds ratio ($13/3 \\approx 4.33$) is greater than the stratum-specific odds ratios ($3$). This inflation, known as positive confounding, occurred because the exposed group had a higher proportion of individuals from the high-risk stratum ($Z=1$), artificially increasing the overall disease frequency in the exposed group compared to the unexposed.\n\n**Part 3: Mantel-Haenszel (MH) Pooled Odds Ratio**\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel method provides a pooled odds ratio that adjusts for the confounding by $Z$. It is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} \\frac{a_{i}d_{i}}{n_{i}}}{\\sum_{i} \\frac{b_{i}c_{i}}{n_{i}}} $$\nwhere $i$ indexes the strata (here, $i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$) and $n_{i} = a_{i}+b_{i}+c_{i}+d_{i}$ is the total number of subjects in stratum $i$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total subjects in each stratum:\n- $n_{0} = 5 + 15 + 10 + 90 = 120$\n- $n_{1} = 60 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 190$\n\nNow, we compute the numerator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{a_{i}d_{i}}{n_{i}} = \\frac{a_{0}d_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{a_{1}d_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 90}{120} + \\frac{60 \\cdot 60}{190} = \\frac{450}{120} + \\frac{3600}{190} $$\n$$ = \\frac{45}{12} + \\frac{360}{19} = \\frac{15}{4} + \\frac{360}{19} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 19 + 360 \\cdot 4}{4 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{285 + 1440}{76} = \\frac{1725}{76} $$\n\nNext, we compute the denominator of the $OR_{MH}$ formula:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\frac{b_{i}c_{i}}{n_{i}} = \\frac{b_{0}c_{0}}{n_{0}} + \\frac{b_{1}c_{1}}{n_{1}} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 10}{120} + \\frac{30 \\cdot 40}{190} = \\frac{150}{120} + \\frac{1200}{190} $$\n$$ = \\frac{15}{12} + \\frac{120}{19} = \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{120}{19} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 19 + 120 \\cdot 4}{4 \\cdot 19} = \\frac{95 + 480}{76} = \\frac{575}{76} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio:\n$$ OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{1725}{76}}{\\frac{575}{76}} = \\frac{1725}{575} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by common factors. Both are divisible by $25$:\n$$ \\frac{1725 \\div 25}{575 \\div 25} = \\frac{69}{23} $$\nRecognizing that $69 = 3 \\times 23$:\n$$ OR_{MH} = 3 $$\nThe Mantel-Haenszel pooled odds ratio is $3$. This value correctly reflects the common stratum-specific odds ratio, providing an adjusted measure of association free from the confounding effect of $Z$.",

            "problem": "An investigator studies the association between a binary exposure $E$ and a binary disease outcome $D$ within two strata of a binary covariate $S \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The covariate $S$ is a strong predictor of the outcome but is independent of the exposure by design. The investigator is interested in the odds ratio as the effect measure.\n\nUsing only the definitions of odds, odds ratio, conditional versus marginal association, and the concept of collapsibility in effect measures, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Provide a precise definition (in words) of non-collapsibility of an effect measure in the context of conditional versus marginal associations.\n2.

Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a multi-part analysis of epidemiological data stratified by a covariate $S$. We will address each part of the problem sequentially using fundamental definitions.\n\n1. Definition of Non-collapsibility\nAn effect measure, such as an odds ratio ($OR$) or risk ratio ($RR$), is said to be non-collapsible if the marginal (crude) measure is not equal to the common value of the stratum-specific (conditional) measures, even when the stratum-specific measures are homogeneous across strata and there is no confounding. Confounding is absent if the stratification variable is independent of the exposure. In such a scenario, any difference between the marginal and the common conditional effect measure is attributable to the mathematical properties of the measure itself, not to a confounding effect. This phenomenon typically occurs when the stratification variable is a risk factor for the outcome.\n\n2. Verification of Data Properties\nThe problem provides data for two strata, $S=0$ and $S=1$. The counts are given in the format $(a_s, b_s; c_s, d_s)$ corresponding to $(E=1, D=1)$, $(E=1, D=0)$; $(E=0, D=1)$, $(E=0, D=0)$ for each stratum $s$.\nFor $S=0$: $(a_0, b_0; c_0, d_0) = (200, 900; 110, 990)$.\nFor $S=1$: $(a_1, b_1; c_1, d_1) = (825, 275; 660, 440)$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the exposure distribution is identical across strata. This confirms the problem's statement that the covariate $S$ is independent of the exposure $E$. The total number of subjects in each stratum is:\n$N_0 = a_0 + b_0 + c_0 + d_0 = 200 + 900 + 110 + 990 = 2200$.\n$N_1 = a_1 + b_1 + c_1 + d_1 = 825 + 275 + 660 + 440 = 2200$.\n\nThe proportion of exposed individuals ($E=1$) in each stratum is:\n$P(E=1 | S=0) = \\frac{a_0 + b_0}{N_0} = \\frac{200 + 900}{2200} = \\frac{1100}{2200} = 0.5$.\n$P(E=1 | S=1) = \\frac{a_1 + b_1}{N_1} = \\frac{825 + 275}{2200} = \\frac{1100}{2200} = 0.5$.\nSince $P(E=1 | S=0) = P(E=1 | S=1)$, the exposure distribution is identical across strata, and $S$ is independent of $E$.\n\nNext, we verify that the stratum-specific odds ratios are equal. The odds ratio for stratum $s$ is calculated as $OR_s = \\frac{a_s d_s}{b_s c_s}$.\nFor stratum $S=0$:\n$$OR_0 = \\frac{a_0 d_0}{b_0 c_0} = \\frac{200 \\times 990}{900 \\times 110} = \\frac{198000}{99000} = 2$$\nFor stratum $S=1$:\n$$OR_1 = \\frac{a_1 d_1}{b_1 c_1} = \\frac{825 \\times 440}{275 \\times 660} = \\frac{363000}{181500} = 2$$\nThe stratum-specific odds ratios are indeed equal: $OR_0 = OR_1 = 2$. This condition is known as homogeneity of the odds ratio across strata.\n\n3. Computation of Pooled and Crude Odds Ratios\nThe Mantel–Haenszel (MH) pooled odds ratio is a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios. The formula is:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{s} \\frac{a_s d_s}{N_s}}{\\sum_{s} \\frac{b_s c_s}{N_s}}$$\nUsing the data:\n$$OR_{MH} = \\frac{\\frac{200 \\times 990}{2200} + \\frac{825 \\times 440}{2200}}{\\frac{900 \\times 110}{2200} + \\frac{275 \\times 660}{2200}} = \\frac{\\frac{198000}{2200} + \\frac{363000}{2200}}{\\frac{99000}{2200} + \\frac{181500}{2200}} = \\frac{90 + 165}{45 + 82.5} = \\frac{255}{127.5} = 2$$\nAs expected, when the stratum-specific odds ratios are homogeneous, the MH estimate equals their common value.\n\nTo compute the crude (marginal) odds ratio, we first collapse the data over the stratifying variable $S$:\n$a_{crude} = a_0 + a_1 = 200 + 825 = 1025$.\n$b_{crude} = b_0 + b_1 = 900 + 275 = 1175$.\n$c_{crude} = c_0 + c_1 = 110 + 660 = 770$.\n$d_{crude} = d_0 + d_1 = 990 + 440 = 1430$.\nThe marginal $2 \\times 2$ table is $(1025, 1175; 770, 1430)$.\n\nThe crude odds ratio is calculated from this collapsed table:\n$$OR_{crude} = \\frac{a_{crude} d_{crude}}{b_{crude} c_{crude}} = \\frac{1025 \\times 1430}{1175 \\times 770} = \\frac{1465750}{904750} \\approx 1.61999447...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $OR_{crude} \\approx 1.620$.\n\n4. Explanation of the Difference\nThe crude odds ratio ($OR_{crude} \\approx 1.620$) is different from the common conditional odds ratio ($OR_0 = OR_1 = OR_{MH} = 2$). This difference is not due to confounding. A confounder must be associated with both the exposure and the outcome. Here, we have shown that the stratifying variable $S$ is independent of the exposure $E$, so a necessary condition for confounding is not met.\n\nThe observed difference is a direct illustration of the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio. This mathematical property arises because the crude odds ratio is a ratio of crude odds, which are not simple weighted averages of the stratum-specific odds in a way that preserves the ratio. This happens when the stratifying variable ($S$) is a predictor of the outcome ($D$), even if it's not a confounder. We can verify that $S$ is a strong predictor of $D$:\nThe risk of disease in stratum $S=0$ is $P(D=1|S=0) = \\frac{a_0+c_0}{N_0} = \\frac{200+110}{2200} = \\frac{310}{2200} \\approx 0.141$.\nThe risk of disease in stratum $S=1$ is $P(D=1|S=1) = \\frac{a_1+c_1}{N_1} = \\frac{825+660}{2200} = \\frac{1485}{2200} \\approx 0.675$.\nSince these risks are vastly different, $S$ is a strong predictor of $D$.\n\nIn summary, the difference between the marginal $OR$ ($1.620$) and the conditional $OR$ ($2$) is due to the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio, which occurs because the covariate $S$ is associated with the outcome $D$ while being independent of the exposure $E$. The marginal $OR$ is a distorted measure of association in this case, and the conditional (or pooled) $OR$ is the appropriate measure of effect.\n\nThe problem asks for the crude (marginal) odds ratio collapsed over $S$.\n$OR_{crude} = \\frac{1025 \\times 1430}{1175 \\times 770} \\approx 1.61999447...$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $1.620$.",

The most commonly used is the Robins-Greenland-Breslow (RGB) estimator. While the full formula is complex, the crucial point is that $\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH})$ is a function derived from the cell counts $(a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i)$ across all $k$ strata. The estimated standard error is the square root of this variance:\n    $$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH})} $$\n\n4.  **Normal Approximation and Interval on Log Scale:** Based on large-sample theory, the statistic\n    $$ Z = \\frac{\\log(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) - \\log(\\theta)}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH})} $$\n    is approximately distributed as a standard normal variable, $N(0, 1)$. This allows for the construction of a $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\log(\\theta)$ as:\n    $$ \\log(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) $$\n    where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution corresponding to a cumulative probability of $1 - \\alpha/2$ (e.g., for a $95\\%$ CI, $\\alpha=0.05$ and $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$).\n\n5.  **Back-Transformation:** To obtain the confidence interval for the odds ratio $\\theta$, we exponentiate the lower and upper bounds of the interval for $\\log(\\theta)$. The resulting CI for $\\theta$ is:\n    $$ \\left( \\exp \\left[ \\log(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) \\right], \\exp \\left[ \\log(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) + z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}) \\right] \\right) $$\n\n6.  **Conditions for Validity:** The validity of this procedure rests on three key assumptions:\n    a.  **Homogeneity of the Odds Ratio:** The MH method assumes that the true odds ratio $\\theta$ is constant across all strata. If there is significant heterogeneity (effect modification), the interpretation of $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ becomes complex, as it represents a weighted average of differing effects.\n    b.  **Large-Sample Approximation:** The normal approximation is valid for large samples. This does not strictly mean each stratum must be large, but rather that the total information across all strata is sufficient. The approximation can be poor if the data are sparse (i.e., many cells have small counts, especially zeros).\n    c.  **Independence of Strata:** The observations in different strata must be independent, a condition typically met by study design.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Take the natural logarithm of $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ to obtain $\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$. Use an estimated standard error for $\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ derived from the stratified $2 \\times 2$ counts under the MH framework. Form the interval on the log scale as $\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH})$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the standard normal quantile, and then exponentiate the endpoints to return to the odds ratio scale. This method is valid when strata are independent, there is a reasonably large total information (for example, moderate cell counts without pervasive zeros), and the common-odds-ratio assumption across strata is tenable; otherwise, small-sample or exact methods may be preferable.**\nThis option accurately and comprehensively describes the standard procedure. It correctly specifies the log transformation, the use of a standard error derived from the data, the use of the normal distribution ($z$-quantile), and the final exponentiation step. Crucially, it also correctly enumerates the primary conditions for validity: independence, large-sample size (sufficient information), and the common-odds-ratio assumption. It correctly notes that other methods are needed when these conditions fail.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Do not transform. Assume $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ is approximately normal on its original scale and form $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH})$. This approach is valid for all sample sizes and even when strata are highly heterogeneous.**\nThe distribution of $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ is known to be skewed, so the normal approximation for it is inferior to the approximation for $\\log(\\hat{\\theta}_{MH})$. The claims that the method is valid for \"all sample sizes\" and with \"highly heterogeneous\" strata are patently false. This method is a large-sample method, and its fundamental assumption is homogeneity, not heterogeneity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Take $\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ and assume it follows a Student’s $t$ distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom. Form $\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH} \\pm t_{k-1,1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\mathrm{SE}}(\\log \\hat{\\theta}_{MH})$, then back-transform by taking the reciprocal of the endpoints. This is valid when $k$ is small.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The large-sample theory for the MH estimator points to a normal distribution, not a Student's $t$ distribution. While $t$-distributions are used in some meta-analytic contexts, it is not the standard for this fixed-effect estimator. Furthermore, the back-transformation from a logarithmic scale is exponentiation, not taking the reciprocal.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Transform the cell proportions in each stratum using the logit function, pool them with inverse-variance weights to obtain a single pooled logit, and then convert this pooled logit to a CI for $\\theta$ by applying the rare disease approximation. This is valid primarily when the disease is rare.**\nThis describes a different method of pooling, specifically an inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis of stratum-specific log-odds ratios. While related, it is not the procedure for constructing a confidence interval based on the Mantel-Haenszel estimator $\\hat{\\theta}_{MH}$ and its specific variance formula. The MH estimator uses a different, non-inverse-variance weighting scheme. The mention of the rare disease approximation is irrelevant to the general construction of the MH confidence interval.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Compute the logarithms of the stratum-specific odds ratios, take their unweighted mean as the pooled log estimate, compute the standard error as if these $k$ log odds ratios were independent and identically distributed, and exponentiate the endpoints. This is valid regardless of whether stratum sizes differ or whether the common-effect assumption holds.**\nThis describes a naive, unweighted pooling method. The Mantel-Haenszel method is explicitly a *weighted* procedure, which gives more weight to more informative (typically larger) strata. An unweighted mean is statistically inefficient. The claim that it is valid regardless of differing stratum sizes is false—weighting is done precisely to account for such differences. The claim of validity when the common-effect assumption fails is also false for a fixed-effect method.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
