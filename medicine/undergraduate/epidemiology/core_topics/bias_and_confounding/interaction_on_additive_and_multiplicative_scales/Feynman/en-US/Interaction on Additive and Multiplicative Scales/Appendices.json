            "problem": "A prospective cohort of $10000$ participants is followed for $10$ years to study incident lung cancer $Y$. Two binary exposures are recorded at baseline: cigarette smoking $A \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and occupational asbestos exposure $B \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The cohort is partitioned into four mutually exclusive groups by $(A,B)$, each with the following counts of lung cancer cases and total participants over follow-up:\n- $(A=0,B=0)$: $25$ cases among $2500$ participants,\n- $(A=1,B=0)$: $75$ cases among $2500$ participants,\n- $(A=0,B=1)$: $50$ cases among $2500$ participants,\n- $(A=1,B=1)$: $150$ cases among $2500$ participants.\n\nAssume there is no loss to follow-up and no competing risks that differentially affect group comparisons. Based only on these data and using the foundational definitions of risk, risk difference, and risk ratio, which option best reflects the presence or absence of interaction on the additive and multiplicative scales and how that should be communicated to a public health audience?\n\nA. There is no interaction because the joint effect equals the product of the individual effects; communication should simply state “no interaction.”\n\nB.

Interaction should only be assessed using odds ratios; because the disease is relatively rare, risk ratios are misleading for interaction assessment.\n\nD. Because the combined risk difference equals the sum of individual risk differences, there is no interaction on any scale; one should summarize findings with a single “synergy index” without distinguishing scales.",
            "solution": "We proceed from core epidemiologic definitions. Let $R_{ab} = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid A=a,B=b)$ denote the risk in group $(a,b)$. The risk difference (RD) for exposure $A$ at $B=b$ is $\\text{RD}_{A \\mid b} = R_{1b} - R_{0b}$, and the risk ratio (RR) for exposure $A$ at $B=b$ is $\\text{RR}_{A \\mid b} = R_{1b} / R_{0b}$. Analogous quantities are defined for exposure $B$. The notion of “no interaction” depends on scale:\n- On the additive scale (risk difference), “no interaction” implies that the joint excess risk equals the sum of the individual excess risks, i.e., $R_{11} - R_{00} = (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00})$. Departures from this relationship indicate additive interaction, often summarized by the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI), defined as $\\text{RERI} = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$.\n- On the multiplicative scale (risk ratio), “no interaction” implies that the joint risk ratio equals the product of the individual risk ratios, i.e., $R_{11}/R_{00} = (R_{10}/R_{00}) \\times (R_{01}/R_{00})$.\n\nStep 1: Compute risks in each group from the counts.\n- $R_{00} = 25/2500 = 0.01$,\n- $R_{10} = 75/2500 = 0.03$,\n- $R_{01} = 50/2500 = 0.02$,\n- $R_{11} = 150/2500 = 0.06$.\n\nStep 2: Assess additive interaction via risk differences and the Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI).\n- Joint excess risk: $R_{11} - R_{00} = 0.06 - 0.01 = 0.05$.\n- Sum of individual excess risks: $(R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00}) = (0.03 - 0.01) + (0.02 - 0.01) = 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03$.\n- Departure from additivity: $0.05 - 0.03 = 0.02 > 0$, indicating positive additive interaction.\n- Equivalently, $\\text{RERI} = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00} = 0.06 - 0.03 - 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.02 > 0$, confirming positive additive interaction.\n\nStep 3: Assess multiplicative interaction via risk ratios.\n- $\\text{RR}_{A \\mid B=0} = R_{10}/R_{00} = 0.03/0.01 = 3$.\n- $\\text{RR}_{B \\mid A=0} = R_{01}/R_{00} = 0.02/0.01 = 2$.\n- Joint risk ratio: $R_{11}/R_{00} = 0.06/0.01 = 6$.\n- Product of individual risk ratios: $3 \\times 2 = 6$.\n- Since $R_{11}/R_{00}$ equals $(R_{10}/R_{00}) \\times (R_{01}/R_{00})$, there is no multiplicative interaction.\n\nStep 4: Communication implications. Best practice is to specify the scale on which interaction is assessed and to align the message with the audience. For public health decision-making, additive interaction is often more directly interpretable because it relates to excess cases attributable to joint exposure beyond the sum of individual exposures. Here, the excess absolute risk due to interaction is $0.02$, which in a population of $2500$ jointly exposed corresponds to $0.02 \\times 2500 = 50$ additional cases beyond additivity over $10$ years.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- A. States “no interaction” without specifying scale and justifies it because the joint effect equals the product of individual effects. While it is true that there is no multiplicative interaction, there is positive additive interaction. Declaring “no interaction” without scale specification is a common communication pitfall. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- B. Accurately identifies positive interaction on the additive scale but none on the multiplicative scale and recommends specifying the scale and emphasizing excess absolute risk beyond the sum of individual risks, which aligns with best practice. Verdict: Correct.\n- C. Claims interaction should only be assessed using odds ratios and that risk ratios are misleading when disease is rare. In a cohort with directly estimated risks, risk ratios are appropriate. Odds ratios approximate risk ratios only under a rare disease assumption and are not required for interaction assessment; moreover, interaction can and should be assessed on clearly defined scales (additive or multiplicative) using risks or rates when available. Verdict: Incorrect.\n- D. Claims the combined risk difference equals the sum of individual risk differences and thus no interaction on any scale, and suggests using a single “synergy index” without distinguishing scales. The premise is false because $0.05 \\neq 0.03$; there is positive additive interaction. Additionally, reducing communication to a single index obscures the critical distinction between scales.

            "solution": "Interaction, or effect modification, assesses whether the effect of one exposure on an outcome is dependent on the presence of another exposure. The assessment depends on the scale of measurement: additive (based on risk differences) or multiplicative (based on risk ratios). The reference category for all comparisons is the group unexposed to both factors ($E_1=0, E_2=0$), which has a baseline risk of $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n\n#### 1. Additive Scale Interaction Analysis\n\nOn an additive scale, we compare risk differences (RD). The absence of interaction implies that the excess risk from the joint exposure is equal to the sum of the excess risks from each individual exposure.\n\n- The baseline risk is $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n- The excess risk due to $E_1$ alone is:\n  $$RD_{10} = p_{10} - p_{00} = 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.10$$\n- The excess risk due to $E_2$ alone is:\n  $$RD_{01} = p_{01} - p_{00} = 0.25 - 0.10 = 0.15$$\n- The expected excess risk for the joint exposure ($E_1=1, E_2=1$) under an additive model (i.e., no additive interaction) is the sum of the individual excess risks:\n  $$RD_{\\text{expected}} = RD_{10} + RD_{01} = 0.10 + 0.15 = 0.25$$\n- The observed excess risk for the joint exposure is:\n  $$RD_{11} = p_{11} - p_{00} = 0.40 - 0.10 = 0.30$$\n- To assess for interaction, we compare the observed joint excess risk ($RD_{11}$) with the expected joint excess risk ($RD_{10} + RD_{01}$):\n  $$RD_{11} \\text{ vs. } RD_{10} + RD_{01}$$\n  $$0.30 \\text{ vs. } 0.25$$\n- Since $0.30 > 0.25$, the observed joint excess risk is greater than the sum of the individual excess risks. This indicates a **positive interaction on the additive scale** (also called synergism). The magnitude of the interaction is $RD_{11} - (RD_{10} + RD_{01}) = 0.30 - 0.25 = 0.05$.\n\n#### 2. Multiplicative Scale Interaction Analysis\n\nOn a multiplicative scale, we compare risk ratios (RR). The absence of interaction implies that the joint risk ratio is equal to the product of the individual risk ratios.\n\n- The baseline risk is $p_{00} = 0.10$.\n- The risk ratio for $E_1$ alone is:\n  $$RR_{10} = \\frac{p_{10}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.20}{0.10} = 2.0$$\n- The risk ratio for $E_2$ alone is:\n  $$RR_{01} = \\frac{p_{01}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.25}{0.10} = 2.5$$\n- The expected risk ratio for the joint exposure ($E_1=1, E_2=1$) under a multiplicative model (i.e., no multiplicative interaction) is the product of the individual risk ratios:\n  $$RR_{\\text{expected}} = RR_{10} \\times RR_{01} = 2.0 \\times 2.5 = 5.0$$\n- The observed risk ratio for the joint exposure is:\n  $$RR_{11} = \\frac{p_{11}}{p_{00}} = \\frac{0.40}{0.10} = 4.0$$\n- To assess for interaction, we compare the observed joint risk ratio ($RR_{11}$) with the expected joint risk ratio ($RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$):\n  $$RR_{11} \\text{ vs. } RR_{10} \\times RR_{01}$$\n  $$4.0 \\text{ vs. } 5.0$$\n- Since $4.0 < 5.0$, the observed joint risk ratio is less than the product of the individual risk ratios. This indicates a **negative interaction on the multiplicative scale** (also called antagonism).\n\n#### 3. Explanation for Discrepancy\n\nThe conclusion about interaction (presence, absence, or direction) can differ between the additive and multiplicative scales because the definition of \"no interaction\" is mathematically different for each scale.\n- **Additive no-interaction model:** $p_{11} - p_{00} = (p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00})$\n- **Multiplicative no-interaction model:** $p_{11} / p_{00} = (p_{10} / p_{00}) \\times (p_{01} / p_{00})$\nThese two conditions are not equivalent. A dataset that satisfies one will generally not satisfy the other. Therefore, the same set of risks can demonstrate positive interaction on one scale and negative interaction on the other, as seen in this problem.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Interpret this contrast conceptually as the departure of the observed joint risk from what would be expected if the effects of $A$ and $B$ simply added relative to the baseline risk.

This contrast, denoted as $I_A$, measures the deviation from additivity of the individual effects of exposures $A$ and $B$ on the risk scale. It is defined as the difference between the risk when both exposures are present and the risk expected if their individual excess risks were simply additive. The formula for the additive interaction contrast is:\n$$I_A = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$$\nThis can also be expressed as $(R_{11} - R_{00}) - (R_{10} - R_{00}) - (R_{01} - R_{00})$, which is the risk difference due to both exposures minus the sum of the risk differences due to each exposure individually.\n\nTo calculate $I_A$, we must first determine the unconditional risks $R_{00}$, $R_{10}$, $R_{01}$, and $R_{11}$ for the combined population. These are calculated from the stratum-specific risks and the stratum probabilities using the law of total probability.

This positive value indicates a synergistic interaction on the additive scale in the crude (unstratified) analysis. The risk for the doubly exposed group is $0.0055$ units higher than what would be expected if the individual excess risks of exposures $A$ and $B$ were simply additive. It is worth noting that within each stratum, there is no additive interaction ($I_{A,0} = 0.045 - 0.03 - 0.035 + 0.02 = 0$ and $I_{A,1} = 0.10 - 0.07 - 0.08 + 0.05 = 0$). The observed interaction in the combined population is therefore an artifact of confounding by $S$, which has a different distribution across the exposure groups.",
