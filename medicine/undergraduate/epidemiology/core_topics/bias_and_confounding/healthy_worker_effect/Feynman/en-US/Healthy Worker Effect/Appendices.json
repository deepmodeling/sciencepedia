This first practice exercise challenges you to quantify the magnitude of the bias directly. By working through a hypothetical cohort study, you will derive an expression for the observed Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) and see how it is systematically distorted by selection factors ($s_i$) that represent the \"healthiness\" of the workers compared to the general population.

            "problem": "A manufacturing cohort study seeks to quantify the magnitude of selection bias due to the healthy worker effect when estimating the effect of a hazardous exposure on all-cause mortality. Consider a cohort of exposed workers, partitioned into $2$ strata by time since hire: stratum $i=1$ with $t<5$ years and stratum $i=2$ with $t \\ge 5$ years. Let $r_{g,i}$ denote the all-cause mortality rate in the general population for stratum $i$, $s_i$ denote the multiplicative selection factor capturing the healthy worker effect such that unexposed workers in stratum $i$ have baseline rate $r_{u,i} = s_i \\, r_{g,i}$ with $0 < s_i < 1$, and $RR_{\\text{true}}$ denote the true causal rate ratio for exposure relative to no exposure within workers that is constant across strata. Let $\\text{PY}_i$ denote the person-years (PY) contributed by the exposed workers in stratum $i$.\n\nUsing only core definitions of incidence rate, expected events under indirect standardization, and the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), derive an expression for the observed SMR of the exposed cohort versus the general population as a function of $RR_{\\text{true}}$, $\\{s_i\\}$, $\\{r_{g,i}\\}$, and $\\{\\text{PY}_i\\}$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is determined to be a valid, well-posed problem in epidemiology. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cohort studies, selection bias (specifically, the healthy worker effect), and indirect standardization. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and the numerical values are plausible.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the observed Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) and then to compute the bias magnitude, $B$, defined as the ratio of the observed SMR to the true causal rate ratio, $RR_{\\text{true}}$.\n\nFirst, we define the components of the SMR. The SMR is the ratio of the total observed deaths in the cohort to the total expected deaths.\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{\\text{Observed Events}}{\\text{Expected Events}} = \\frac{O_{\\text{total}}}{E_{\\text{total}}}\n$$\n\nThe total observed events, $O_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of observed events across all strata. The number of observed events in a given stratum $i$, denoted $O_i$, is the product of the mortality rate in the exposed workers of that stratum, $r_{e,i}$, and the person-years, $\\text{PY}_i$.\n$$\nO_i = r_{e,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i\n$$\nThe rate $r_{e,i}$ is related to the rate in unexposed workers, $r_{u,i}$, by the true causal rate ratio, $RR_{\\text{true}}$. The problem states this relationship is constant across strata:\n$$\nRR_{\\text{true}} = \\frac{r_{e,i}}{r_{u,i}} \\implies r_{e,i} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot r_{u,i}\n$$\nThe rate in unexposed workers, $r_{u,i}$, is influenced by the healthy worker effect, represented by the selection factor $s_i$, relative to the general population rate $r_{g,i}$:\n$$\nr_{u,i} = s_i \\cdot r_{g,i}\n$$\nBy substitution, we find the mortality rate in the exposed workers as a function of the general population rate, the selection factor, and the true rate ratio:\n$$\nr_{e,i} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot (s_i \\cdot r_{g,i})\n$$\nThe total number of observed events is the sum over all strata:\n$$\nO_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i} O_i = \\sum_{i} (r_{e,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i) = \\sum_{i} (RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total expected events, $E_{\\text{total}}$. This is determined by applying the stratum-specific mortality rates of the reference (general) population, $r_{g,i}$, to the person-years of the study cohort in each stratum. The expected events in stratum $i$, denoted $E_i$, is:\n$$\nE_i = r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i\n$$\nThe total expected events is the sum over all strata:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i} E_i = \\sum_{i} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the expression for the SMR by substituting the expressions for $O_{\\text{total}}$ and $E_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}\n$$\nSince $RR_{\\text{true}}$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the summation in the numerator:\n$$\n\\text{SMR} = RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i} (s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the observed SMR.\n\nThe problem defines the observed rate ratio as $RR_{\\text{obs}} = \\text{SMR}$ and the bias magnitude as $B = RR_{\\text{obs}}/RR_{\\text{true}}$. Substituting our expression for SMR gives:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\text{SMR}}{RR_{\\text{true}}} = \\frac{1}{RR_{\\text{true}}} \\left( RR_{\\text{true}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sum_{i} (s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)} \\right)\n$$\nThe $RR_{\\text{true}}$ terms cancel, yielding the expression for the bias magnitude:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\sum_{i} (s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}{\\sum_{i} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that the bias factor $B$ is a weighted average of the stratum-specific selection factors $\\{s_i\\}$, where the weights are the stratum-specific expected numbers of deaths, $E_i = r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i$.\n\nWe now compute $B$ using the provided numerical values for the two strata ($i=1, 2$):\nFor stratum $1$: $\\text{PY}_1 = 30{,}000$, $r_{g,1} = 0.004$, $s_1 = 0.50$.\nFor stratum $2$: $\\text{PY}_2 = 70{,}000$, $r_{g,2} = 0.010$, $s_2 = 0.80$.\n\nFirst, calculate the numerator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} (s_i \\cdot r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)$:\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (s_1 \\cdot r_{g,1} \\cdot \\text{PY}_1) + (s_2 \\cdot r_{g,2} \\cdot \\text{PY}_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (0.50 \\cdot 0.004 \\cdot 30{,}000) + (0.80 \\cdot 0.010 \\cdot 70{,}000)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Numerator} = (60) + (560) = 620\n$$\n\nNext, calculate the denominator, $\\sum_{i=1}^{2} (r_{g,i} \\cdot \\text{PY}_i)$:\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = (r_{g,1} \\cdot \\text{PY}_1) + (r_{g,2} \\cdot \\text{PY}_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = (0.004 \\cdot 30{,}000) + (0.010 \\cdot 70{,}000)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Denominator} = (120) + (700) = 820\n$$\nThese terms represent the expected deaths in each stratum, $E_1=120$ and $E_2=700$.\n\nFinally, compute the bias magnitude $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{620}{820} = \\frac{62}{82} = \\frac{31}{41}\n$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.75609756...$.
