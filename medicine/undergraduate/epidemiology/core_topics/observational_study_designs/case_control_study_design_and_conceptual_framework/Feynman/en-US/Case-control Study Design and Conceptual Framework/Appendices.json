            "problem": "A case-control study investigates the association between a binary exposure and a binary disease. Investigators enroll $N_{D} = a + c$ cases and $N_{\\bar{D}} = b + d$ controls, recording exposure status to form a two-by-two $2 \\times 2$ table with cell counts $a$ (exposed cases), $b$ (exposed controls), $c$ (unexposed cases), and $d$ (unexposed controls). Assume independent sampling of cases and controls, non-differential exposure measurement, and large-sample conditions under which the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the log odds ratio is asymptotically normal.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of odds and odds ratio, where the odds of exposure among cases is $\\text{odds}_{D} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid D)}$ and the odds of exposure among controls is $\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})}$, the odds ratio (OR) is defined as $\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_{D}}{\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}}}$.

Using the case-control study conceptual framework and large-sample approximations, proceed as follows:\n- Derive the estimator of the odds ratio from the definitions.\n- Derive the large-sample variance of the estimator of $\\log(\\text{OR})$ from the cell counts.\n- Use the asymptotic normality of $\\log(\\text{OR})$ to construct a two-sided Confidence Interval (CI) with confidence level $0.95$ for the odds ratio by transforming the CI on the log scale back to the odds ratio scale.\n\nFinally, report only the lower limit of the two-sided $0.95$ CI for the odds ratio as a decimal, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required in the answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the lower limit of a $0.95$ confidence interval for an odds ratio (OR) from a case-control study. The solution will proceed in three stages as requested: first, the derivation of the odds ratio estimator; second, the derivation of the large-sample variance for the logarithm of this estimator; and third, the construction of the confidence interval and calculation of its lower bound using the provided data.\n\nThe problem is validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and biostatistics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Odds Ratio Estimator**\n\nThe odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the odds of exposure among cases ($D$) to the odds of exposure among controls ($\\bar{D}$).\nLet $E$ denote exposure and $\\bar{E}$ denote non-exposure. The odds of exposure in the case group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{D} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{P(E \\mid D)}{1 - P(E \\mid D)}\n$$\nThe odds of exposure in the control group is:\n$$\n\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{P(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{1 - P(E \\mid \\bar{D})}\n$$\nThe true odds ratio is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_{D}}{\\text{odds}_{\\bar{D}}}\n$$\nIn a case-control study, we sample a fixed number of cases, $N_{D} = a+c$, and a fixed number of controls, $N_{\\bar{D}} = b+d$. Within these samples, we can directly estimate the conditional probabilities of exposure. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the probability of exposure given case status, $P(E \\mid D)$, is the sample proportion of exposed cases:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid D) = \\frac{a}{a+c}\n$$\nSimilarly, the MLE for the probability of non-exposure given case status is:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D) = \\frac{c}{a+c}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among cases is therefore:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid D)}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid D)} = \\frac{a / (a+c)}{c / (a+c)} = \\frac{a}{c}\n$$\nAnalogous logic applies to the control group:\n$$\n\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{b}{b+d} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D}) = \\frac{d}{b+d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds of exposure among controls is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}} = \\frac{\\hat{P}(E \\mid \\bar{D})}{\\hat{P}(\\bar{E} \\mid \\bar{D})} = \\frac{b / (b+d)}{d / (b+d)} = \\frac{b}{d}\n$$\nThe estimator for the odds ratio, denoted $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$, is the ratio of these estimated odds, commonly known as the cross-product ratio:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{D}}{\\widehat{\\text{odds}}_{\\bar{D}}} = \\frac{a/c}{b/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Large-Sample Variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$**\n\nThe distribution of $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$ is typically skewed. However, its natural logarithm, $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$, is approximately normally distributed for large sample sizes. Let $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta} = \\log\\left(\\frac{ad}{bc}\\right) = \\log(a) + \\log(d) - \\log(b) - \\log(c)\n$$\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be derived using the delta method. A standard result, known as the Woolf method, is that the large-sample approximation for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the cell counts. This can be justified by considering that under independent sampling of cases and controls, the counts of exposed subjects, $a$ and $b$, are independent binomial random variables: $a \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_D, p_1)$ and $b \\sim \\text{Bin}(N_{\\bar{D}}, p_2)$, where $p_1 = P(E|D)$ and $p_2 = P(E|\\bar{D})$. The quantity $\\hat{\\theta}$ can be written as $\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1) - \\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)$, where $\\hat{p}_1 = a/N_D$ and $\\hat{p}_2=b/N_{\\bar{D}}$.\nBy the delta method, the variance of the logit of a binomial proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$ is approximately $\\frac{1}{np(1-p)}$. This is estimated by substituting observed counts, yielding $\\frac{1}{k} + \\frac{1}{n-k}$.\nApplying this to our independent samples:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_1)) + \\text{Var}(\\text{logit}(\\hat{p}_2)) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{c}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{d}\\right)\n$$\nThus, the estimator for the variance of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}\n$$\n\n**3. Confidence Interval Construction and Calculation**\n\nUnder the large-sample assumption, the estimator $\\hat{\\theta} = \\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ follows a normal distribution:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\log(\\text{OR}), \\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right)\n$$\nThe standard error (SE) of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$ is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{d}}\n$$\nA two-sided $100(1-\\alpha)\\%$ confidence interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is constructed as:\n$$\n\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\n$$\nwhere $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution. For a $0.95$ confidence level, $\\alpha=0.05$, so $1-\\alpha/2 = 0.975$. The corresponding critical value is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.96$.\n\nTo obtain the confidence interval for the $\\text{OR}$ itself, we exponentiate the lower and upper bounds of the interval for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp\\left[\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) - z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}))\\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given cell counts: $a = 75$, $b = 30$, $c = 25$, and $d = 70$.\n\nFirst, calculate the point estimate $\\widehat{\\text{OR}}$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{OR}} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{75 \\times 70}{30 \\times 25} = \\frac{5250}{750} = 7\n$$\nNext, calculate the variance and standard error of $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{1}{75} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{25} + \\frac{1}{70}\n$$\nUsing a common denominator of $1050$:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\frac{14}{1050} + \\frac{35}{1050} + \\frac{42}{1050} + \\frac{15}{1050} = \\frac{14+35+42+15}{1050} = \\frac{106}{1050} = \\frac{53}{525}\n$$\nNumerically, $\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) \\approx 0.10095238$.\nThe standard error is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{SE}}(\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}})) = \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 0.3177300\n$$\nNow we construct the $0.95$ CI for $\\log(\\text{OR})$. The point estimate is $\\log(\\widehat{\\text{OR}}) = \\ln(7) \\approx 1.945910$.\nThe lower limit for $\\log(\\text{OR})$ is:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\log(\\text{OR})} = \\ln(7) - 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{53}{525}} \\approx 1.945910 - 1.96 \\times 0.3177300 \\approx 1.945910 - 0.6227508 \\approx 1.3231592\n$$\nFinally, we compute the lower limit for the $\\text{OR}$ by exponentiating this value:\n$$\n\\text{LL}_{\\text{OR}} = \\exp(1.3231592) \\approx 3.75515\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the lower limit is $3.755$.",

            "problem": "A population is in demographic and epidemiologic steady state, with rare disease $D$ and binary exposure $E$. You plan a case-control study to estimate the association between $E$ and $D$. Controls would be sampled at a fixed calendar time from the population at risk.

            "solution": "The target estimand in an incident case-control design with density sampling is the incidence rate ratio, which is the ratio of incidence rates among the exposed and unexposed.

The incident case-control odds ratio under proper density sampling is consistent for the incidence rate ratio, so the target is $I_{E}/I_{U}$.\n\nWhen cases are sampled as prevalent at a single point in calendar time, selection into the case set is proportional to how long diseased individuals remain alive with the disease. Under demographic and epidemiologic steady state with rare disease, the prevalence at a point is proportional to the product of the incidence rate and the mean duration with disease. Formally, for group $g \\in \\{E, U\\}$, the point prevalence satisfies $P_{g} \\propto I_{g} \\times L_{g}$, where $L_{g}$ is the mean post-diagnosis survival time for cases in group $g$.\n\nTherefore, the odds ratio from a prevalent case-control study with controls sampled from the population at risk at the same time is proportional to\n$$\n\\frac{I_{E} \\times L_{E}}{I_{U} \\times L_{U}}.\n$$\nRelative to the incident case-control target odds ratio $I_{E}/I_{U}$, the multiplicative bias factor $B$ induced by using prevalent cases is\n$$\nB \\equiv \\frac{\\left(I_{E} \\times L_{E}\\right)/\\left(I_{U} \\times L_{U}\\right)}{I_{E}/I_{U}} = \\frac{L_{E}}{L_{U}}.\n$$\n\nTo compute $L_{E}$ and $L_{U}$ from the survival hazards, note that the mean of an exponential distribution with hazard (rate) parameter $\\mu$ is the reciprocal of the hazard:\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} S(t)\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\mu t)\\,dt = \\frac{1}{\\mu}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\nL_{E} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{E}} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10,\n\\quad\nL_{U} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_{U}} = \\frac{1}{0.25} = 4.\n$$\nThe bias factor is then\n$$\nB = \\frac{L_{E}}{L_{U}} = \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5.\n$$\n\nInterpreting the direction, $B > 1$ indicates that using prevalent cases would inflate the odds ratio relative to the incident case target because exposed cases survive longer on average, making them overrepresented among prevalent cases.

            "introduction": "To address challenges related to the timing of disease onset and create a more robust estimate, epidemiologists often use advanced sampling strategies. This practice delves into risk-set sampling (also known as incidence density sampling), where controls are selected from the population at risk at the precise moment each case is diagnosed.

            "problem": "A dynamic cohort of $N=1000$ workers is assembled at calendar time $0$ and followed for $12$ months for a rare incident respiratory outcome. At baseline, exposure to a volatile solvent is binary and time-fixed: $E=400$ workers are exposed (denoted $E$) and $U=600$ workers are unexposed (denoted $U$). There is no loss to follow-up and no competing risks. Incident cases are time-stamped at their failure times. You are to construct a case-control sample using risk-set (incidence density) sampling matched on time at risk, and then compute the incidence density odds ratio.\n\nFundamental setup and data:\n- Incident cases occur at calendar times $t=\\{1,3,4,8,9,11\\}$ months, with exposure statuses at failure: at $t=1$ the case is $E$; at $t=3$ the case is $U$; at $t=4$ the case is $E$; at $t=8$ the case is $E$; at $t=9$ the case is $U$; at $t=11$ the case is $E$.\n- There are $m=2$ controls selected per case time.

Controls are sampled uniformly without replacement within each $R(t_i)$, with sampling across different times allowing the same person to be sampled multiple times and allowing a sampled control to later become a case.

            "solution": "This problem consists of two tasks: first, to provide a theoretical justification for the validity of risk-set sampling in a case-control study, and second, to compute the incidence density odds ratio from the provided data.\n\n### Task 1: Justification of Risk-Set Sampling\n\nThe objective of a cohort study is often to estimate the ratio of incidence rates between an exposed group and an unexposed group. This quantity is known as the incidence rate ratio ($IRR$), or sometimes the incidence density ratio.\n\nThe incidence rate ($IR$) in a population is defined as the number of new cases of a disease divided by the total person-time at risk. For the exposed and unexposed subgroups of the cohort, the incidence rates are:\n$$ IR_E = \\frac{\\text{Cases among Exposed}}{\\text{Person-Time of Exposed}} = \\frac{A_{cohort}}{PT_E} $$\n$$ IR_U = \\frac{\\text{Cases among Unexposed}}{\\text{Person-Time of Unexposed}} = \\frac{B_{cohort}}{PT_U} $$\nwhere $A_{cohort}$ and $B_{cohort}$ are the total number of cases that arise from the exposed and unexposed members of the cohort, respectively, and $PT_E$ and $PT_U$ represent the total person-time at risk for each group. The person-time is the sum of the time each individual remains at risk of becoming a case.\n\nThe incidence rate ratio is the ratio of these two rates:\n$$ IRR = \\frac{IR_E}{IR_U} = \\frac{A_{cohort} / PT_E}{B_{cohort} / PT_U} $$\nThis can be rearranged to separate the ratio of cases from the ratio of person-time:\n$$ IRR = \\frac{A_{cohort}}{B_{cohort}} \\times \\frac{PT_U}{PT_E} $$\nIn a full cohort study, all quantities ($A_{cohort}$, $B_{cohort}$, $PT_E$, $PT_U$) are directly measured. However, collecting full cohort data, especially person-time, can be resource-intensive. The case-control study nested within a cohort is a more efficient design.\n\nIn a case-control study, we identify all cases ($A_{cohort}$ and $B_{cohort}$) and sample a small group of controls from the source population that gave rise to the cases. The key challenge is to select controls in such a way that they provide an unbiased estimate of the exposure distribution in the underlying source population's person-time.\n\nRisk-set (or incidence-density) sampling achieves this. At each time $t_i$ that a case occurs, we define a risk set, $R(t_i)$, which comprises all individuals in the cohort who are still at risk of becoming a case just prior to time $t_i$. A small number of controls are then randomly sampled from this risk set.\n\nLet's analyze the composition of the person-time. The total person-time is the integral of the number of individuals at risk over the follow-up period. Let $N_E(t)$ and $N_U(t)$ be the number of exposed and unexposed individuals at risk at time $t$. Then:\n$$ PT_E = \\int N_E(t) dt \\quad \\text{and} \\quad PT_U = \\int N_U(t) dt $$\nThe ratio of person-time is:\n$$ \\frac{PT_E}{PT_U} = \\frac{\\int N_E(t) dt}{\\int N_U(t) dt} $$\n\nIn risk-set sampling, when a case occurs at time $t_i$, the controls are sampled from a population of $N_E(t_i)$ exposed and $N_U(t_i)$ unexposed individuals (after excluding the case itself, which has a negligible effect if the cohort is large). The probability that a randomly selected control is exposed is $p(E|t_i) = \\frac{N_E(t_i)}{N_E(t_i) + N_U(t_i)}$. The odds of a control being exposed at time $t_i$ is:\n$$ \\frac{p(E|t_i)}{1-p(E|t_i)} = \\frac{N_E(t_i)}{N_U(t_i)} $$\n\nWhen we pool the controls selected across all case occurrence times, the ratio of the total number of exposed controls ($C$) to unexposed controls ($D$) reflects a weighted average of these instantaneous exposure odds over the time periods when cases occurred. If the disease is rare, the timing of cases can be considered a stochastic process that effectively samples person-time. Thus, the ratio of exposed to unexposed controls, $C/D$, provides an unbiased estimate of the ratio of exposed to unexposed person-time in the cohort:\n$$ \\frac{C}{D} \\approx \\frac{PT_E}{PT_U} $$\nNow, let's look at the case-control odds ratio ($OR_{cc}$). We assemble a $2 \\times 2$ table with the cases ($A$ exposed, $B$ unexposed) and the sampled controls ($C$ exposed, $D$ unexposed). The odds ratio is calculated as:\n$$ OR_{cc} = \\frac{\\text{Odds of exposure in cases}}{\\text{Odds of exposure in controls}} = \\frac{A/B}{C/D} $$\nSubstituting our finding that $C/D$ estimates the person-time ratio $PT_E/PT_U$:\n$$ OR_{cc} \\approx \\frac{A/B}{PT_E/PT_U} = \\frac{A}{B} \\times \\frac{PT_U}{PT_E} $$\nSince the cases in the case-control study are all the cases from the cohort, $A = A_{cohort}$ and $B = B_{cohort}$. Therefore:\n$$ OR_{cc} \\approx \\frac{A_{cohort}}{B_{cohort}} \\times \\frac{PT_U}{PT_E} = IRR $$\nThis demonstrates that the odds ratio from a case-control study with time-matched risk-set sampling is a valid and unbiased estimator of the incidence rate ratio of the source cohort. The control group, by being sampled from the risk sets concurrent with case occurrence, correctly represents the person-time experience of the cohort.\n\n### Task 2: Computation of the Incidence Density Odds Ratio\n\nThe problem provides the necessary data to compute the incidence density odds ratio. The calculation requires us to classify all cases and all sampled controls by their exposure status.\n\nFirst, we compile the data for the cases. There are $6$ incident cases.\n-   Cases with exposure status $E$: occur at $t=\\{1, 4, 8, 11\\}$. Number of exposed cases, $A = 4$.\n-   Cases with exposure status $U$: occur at $t=\\{3, 9\\}$. Number of unexposed cases, $B = 2$.\nThe total number of cases is $A+B = 4+2=6$, which matches the provided data.\nThe odds of exposure among cases is:\n$$ \\frac{A}{B} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2 $$\n\nSecond, we compile the data for the controls. At each of the $6$ case times, $m=2$ controls were sampled. This gives a total of $6 \\times 2 = 12$ controls.\n-   At $t=1$: controls are $\\{E,U\\}$ $\\implies 1$ exposed, $1$ unexposed.\n-   At $t=3$: controls are $\\{E,U\\}$ $\\implies 1$ exposed, $1$ unexposed.\n-   At $t=4$: controls are $\\{U,U\\}$ $\\implies 0$ exposed, $2$ unexposed.\n-   At $t=8$: controls are $\\{E,U\\}$ $\\implies 1$ exposed, $1$ unexposed.\n-   At $t=9$: controls are $\\{U,U\\}$ $\\implies 0$ exposed, $2$ unexposed.\n-   At $t=11$: controls are $\\{E,U\\}$ $\\implies 1$ exposed, $1$ unexposed.\n\nWe sum the number of exposed and unexposed controls across all sampling times.\n-   Total number of exposed controls, $C = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4$.\n-   Total number of unexposed controls, $D = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8$.\nThe total number of controls is $C+D = 4+8=12$, which is correct.\nThe odds of exposure among the sampled controls is:\n$$ \\frac{C}{D} = \\frac{4}{8} = 0.5 $$\n\nThe incidence density odds ratio is defined as the ratio of the exposure odds among cases to the exposure odds among controls.\n$$ OR = \\frac{A/B}{C/D} $$\nSubstituting the values we calculated:\n$$ OR = \\frac{4/2}{4/8} = \\frac{2}{0.5} = 4 $$\nThe resulting incidence density odds ratio is $4$. This suggests that the incidence rate of the respiratory outcome is $4$ times higher among exposed workers compared to unexposed workers, based on this sample.\nThe data can be summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ table:\n\\begin{array}{c|cc|c}\n& \\text{Exposed} & \\text{Unexposed} & \\text{Total} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Cases} & A=4 & B=2 & 6 \\\\\n\\text{Controls} & C=4 & D=8 & 12 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Total} & 8 & 10 & 18\n\\end{array}\n\nThe calculation from the table is:\n$$ OR = \\frac{A \\times D}{B \\times C} = \\frac{4 \\times 8}{2 \\times 4} = \\frac{32}{8} = 4 $$\nThis confirms the result.",
