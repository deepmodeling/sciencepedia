Exposure status is fixed at entry and does not change during follow-up. The event of interest is the first incident diagnosis of Disease $X$; once Disease $X$ occurs, the individual stops contributing person-time.

The problem is scientifically grounded in standard epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution can be computed.\n\nThe incidence density, also known as the incidence rate, is a measure of the rate at which new cases of a disease occur in a population at risk over a specified period. It is calculated as the total number of new cases divided by the total person-time of observation. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{Incidence Density} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Total person-time at risk}}\n$$\nPerson-time for each individual is calculated as the duration from their entry into the study until they experience the event of interest (incident Disease $X$) or are censored (due to loss to follow-up, unrelated death, or the administrative end of the study). Let $t_{entry}$ be the time of entry and $t_{exit}$ be the time of exit for an individual. The person-time contributed by that individual is $t_{exit} - t_{entry}$.\n\nWe will calculate the incidence density separately for the exposed group and the unexposed group.\n\n**1. Calculation for the Exposed Group**\n\nFirst, we identify the number of incident cases of Disease $X$ in the exposed group. The individuals who developed the disease are $E_1$, $E_3$, $E_4$, and $E_6$.\n- Number of cases in the exposed group, $N_E = 4$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total person-time contributed by all individuals in the exposed group, $PT_E$. Each individual's contribution is calculated as follows:\n- $E_1$: Enters at $t=0$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=3.2$. Person-time = $3.2 - 0.0 = 3.2$ years.\n- $E_2$: Enters at $t=1.0$, exit due to loss to follow-up at $t=4.5$. Person-time = $4.5 - 1.0 = 3.5$ years.\n- $E_3$: Enters at $t=0.5$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=2.0$. Person-time = $2.0 - 0.5 = 1.5$ years.\n- $E_4$: Enters at $t=2.0$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=4.0$. Person-time = $4.0 - 2.0 = 2.0$ years.\n- $E_5$: Enters at $t=1.7$, exit due to administrative censoring at $t=5.0$. Person-time = $5.0 - 1.7 = 3.3$ years.\n- $E_6$: Enters at $t=3.0$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=4.2$. Person-time = $4.2 - 3.0 = 1.2$ years.\n\nThe total person-time for the exposed group is the sum of these individual contributions:\n$$\nPT_E = 3.2 + 3.5 + 1.5 + 2.0 + 3.3 + 1.2 = 14.7 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe incidence density for the exposed group, $ID_E$, is:\n$$\nID_E = \\frac{N_E}{PT_E} = \\frac{4}{14.7} \\approx 0.2721088...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $ID_E = 0.2721$ cases per person-year.\n\n**2. Calculation for the Unexposed Group**\n\nFirst, we identify the number of incident cases of Disease $X$ in the unexposed group. The individuals who developed the disease are $U_1$, $U_4$, and $U_5$.\n- Number of cases in the unexposed group, $N_U = 3$.\n\nNext, we calculate the total person-time contributed by all individuals in the unexposed group, $PT_U$.\n- $U_1$: Enters at $t=0.2$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=3.0$. Person-time = $3.0 - 0.2 = 2.8$ years.\n- $U_2$: Enters at $t=0.0$, exit due to unrelated death at $t=2.5$. Person-time = $2.5 - 0.0 = 2.5$ years.\n- $U_3$: Enters at $t=2.0$, exit due to administrative censoring at $t=5.0$. Person-time = $5.0 - 2.0 = 3.0$ years.\n- $U_4$: Enters at $t=1.2$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=1.7$. Person-time = $1.7 - 1.2 = 0.5$ years.\n- $U_5$: Enters at $t=4.0$, exit due to Disease $X$ at $t=4.6$. Person-time = $4.6 - 4.0 = 0.6$ years.\n- $U_6$: Enters at $t=3.5$, exit due to loss to follow-up at $t=4.0$. Person-time = $4.0 - 3.5 = 0.5$ years.\n\nThe total person-time for the unexposed group is the sum of these individual contributions:\n$$\nPT_U = 2.8 + 2.5 + 3.0 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.5 = 9.9 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe incidence density for the unexposed group, $ID_U$, is:\n$$\nID_U = \\frac{N_U}{PT_U} = \\frac{3}{9.9} = \\frac{30}{99} = \\frac{10}{33} \\approx 0.303030...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $ID_U = 0.3030$ cases per person-year.\n\nThe final results for the incidence densities, expressed in cases per person-year and rounded to four significant figures, are $0.2721$ for the exposed group and $0.3030$ for the unexposed group.",

The concepts of survival functions, hazard functions, and right-censoring are well-established.

A unique solution exists and can be derived directly from the provided data and definitions.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and quantitative.

There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The scenario (a small cohort study of cardiovascular mortality) and the data are plausible for an illustrative example in this field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires calculating the survival probability at time $t=3$ years using two different non-parametric methods: the Kaplan-Meier (product-limit) estimator and a survival estimate derived from the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator.\n\nFirst, we must organize the data by ordering the observed times and identifying the distinct event times. The unique event times are the points at which the survival function estimate will change.\n\nThe ordered times ($T_i$) and event indicators ($\\delta_i=1$ for event, $\\delta_i=0$ for censored) are:\n$0.7$ ($\\delta=1$), $1.2$ ($\\delta=0$), $1.6$ ($\\delta=1$), $2.0$ ($\\delta=0$), $2.5$ ($\\delta=0$), $2.9$ ($\\delta=1$), $3.0$ ($\\delta=0$), $3.8$ ($\\delta=1$), $4.5$ ($\\delta=0$), $5.0$ ($\\delta=0$).\n\nThe distinct event times are $t_1=0.7$, $t_2=1.6$, $t_3=2.9$, and $t_4=3.8$.\n\nTo compute both estimators, we construct a life table that tracks the number of individuals at risk ($n_i$), the number of events ($d_i$), and the number censored ($c_i$) in the intervals between event times.\n\n**1. Kaplan-Meier (KM) Survival Estimate**\n\nThe Kaplan-Meier estimator for the survival function $S(t)$ is given by the product-limit formula:\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(t) = \\prod_{i: t_i \\leq t} \\left(1 - \\frac{d_i}{n_i}\\right) $$\nwhere $t_i$ are the distinct event times, $d_i$ is the number of events at time $t_i$, and $n_i$ is the number of individuals at risk (not yet having an event or being censored) just prior to time $t_i$.\n\nWe need to calculate $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3)$. This involves considering all event times less than or equal to $3$. These are $t_1=0.7$, $t_2=1.6$, and $t_3=2.9$.\n\n- **At event time $t_1 = 0.7$**:\n  - All $10$ participants are at risk. So, $n_1 = 10$.\n  - One event occurs. So, $d_1 = 1$.\n  - The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_1}{n_1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{9}{10}$.\n\n- **At event time $t_2 = 1.6$**:\n  - To find the number at risk, $n_2$, we start with the $10$ participants and subtract those who had an event or were censored before $t_2$.\n  - One event occurred at $t=0.7$. One participant was censored at $t=1.2$.\n  - So, the number at risk is $n_2 = 10 - 1 - 1 = 8$.\n  - One event occurs at $t=1.6$. So, $d_2 = 1$.\n  - The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_2}{n_2} = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$.\n\n- **At event time $t_3 = 2.9$**:\n  - To find the number at risk, $n_3$, we start with the $8$ individuals at risk before $t_2=1.6$ and subtract those who had an event or were censored between $t=1.6$ and $t=2.9$.\n  - One event occurred at $t=1.6$. Two participants were censored at $t=2.0$ and $t=2.5$.\n  - So, the number at risk is $n_3 = 8 - 1 - 2 = 5$.\n  - One event occurs at $t=2.9$. So, $d_3 = 1$.\n  - The survival factor is $1 - \\frac{d_3}{n_3} = 1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe next event occurs at $t_4=3.8$, which is greater than $3$. The KM estimate is a step function, constant between event times. Therefore, $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3)$ is the value of the survival function after the last event at or before time $3$, which is the event at $t=2.9$.\n\nWe calculate $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3)$ by multiplying the survival factors for all event times up to $t=3$:\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{10}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{8}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) $$\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3) = \\frac{9}{10} \\times \\frac{7}{8} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{9 \\times 7 \\times 4}{10 \\times 8 \\times 5} = \\frac{252}{400} $$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3) = \\frac{63}{100} $$\n\n**2. Nelson-Aalen (NA) Based Survival Estimate**\n\nThe Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard function $H(t)$ is given by:\n$$ \\widehat{H}_{\\text{NA}}(t) = \\sum_{i: t_i \\leq t} \\frac{d_i}{n_i} $$\nUsing the same values for $t_i$, $d_i$, and $n_i$ as in the KM calculation, we sum the hazard contributions for all event times less than or equal to $3$.\n\n$$ \\widehat{H}_{\\text{NA}}(3) = \\frac{d_1}{n_1} + \\frac{d_2}{n_2} + \\frac{d_3}{n_3} $$\n$$ \\widehat{H}_{\\text{NA}}(3) = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{5} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $40$.\n$$ \\widehat{H}_{\\text{NA}}(3) = \\frac{4}{40} + \\frac{5}{40} + \\frac{8}{40} = \\frac{17}{40} $$\nThe problem asks for the survival probability obtained by transforming this cumulative hazard estimate using the relationship $S(t) = \\exp(-H(t))$.\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{NA}}(t) = \\exp(-\\widehat{H}_{\\text{NA}}(t)) $$\nSubstituting the value at $t=3$:\n$$ \\widehat{S}_{\\text{NA}}(3) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{17}{40}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the results to be expressed as a rational fraction for the KM estimate and as an exponential expression for the NA-based estimate.\n\nThe two computed values are:\n- Kaplan-Meier survival at $3$ years: $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{KM}}(3) = \\frac{63}{100}$\n- Nelson-Aalen based survival at $3$ years: $\\widehat{S}_{\\text{NA}}(3) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{17}{40}\\right)$",

The overall survival probability, $S(t)$, is the probability of being free of *any* event (A or B) up to time $t$.\n\nFirst, we define the overall hazard rate, $\\lambda_{all}(t)$, as the sum of all cause-specific hazard rates:\n$$ \\lambda_{all}(t) = \\lambda_A(t) + \\lambda_B(t) $$\nThe overall survival function $S(t)$ is then given by:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_{all}(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\right) $$\nThe CIF for event $A$ at time $t$ is:\n$$ I_A(t) = P(T \\le t, \\text{Event}=A) = \\int_0^t \\lambda_A(u) S(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\nSince the hazard functions are piecewise constant, we must split the integral at $t=2$.\n$$ I_A(3) = \\int_0^2 \\lambda_A(u) S(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u + \\int_2^3 \\lambda_A(u) S(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\n\n**Interval 1: $0 \\le t < 2$ years**\nThe cause-specific hazards are $\\lambda_A(t) = 0.05$ and $\\lambda_B(t) = 0.02$.\nThe overall hazard is $\\lambda_{all}(t) = 0.05 + 0.02 = 0.07$.\nFor $t$ in this interval, the overall survival function is:\n$$ S(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t 0.07 \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\right) = \\exp(-0.07t) $$\nThe contribution to the CIF from this interval is:\n$$ \\int_0^2 \\lambda_A(u) S(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\int_0^2 0.05 \\exp(-0.07u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\n$$ = 0.05 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-0.07u)}{-0.07} \\right]_0^2 = -\\frac{0.05}{0.07} (\\exp(-0.07 \\times 2) - \\exp(0)) = \\frac{5}{7} (1 - \\exp(-0.14)) $$\n\n**Interval 2: $2 \\le t \\le 5$ years**\nThe cause-specific hazards are $\\lambda_A(t) = 0.02$ and $\\lambda_B(t) = 0.03$.\nThe overall hazard is $\\lambda_{all}(t) = 0.02 + 0.03 = 0.05$.\nFor $t \\ge 2$, the overall survival function is:\n$$ S(t) = S(2) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\int_2^t 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{d}u\\right) $$\nFirst, we find $S(2)$ using the parameters from the first interval:\n$$ S(2) = \\exp(-0.07 \\times 2) = \\exp(-0.14) $$\nSo, for $t \\ge 2$, the survival function is $S(t) = \\exp(-0.14) \\exp(-0.05(t-2))$.\nThe contribution to the CIF from the interval $[2, 3]$ is:\n$$ \\int_2^3 \\lambda_A(u) S(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = \\int_2^3 0.02 \\exp(-0.14) \\exp(-0.05(u-2)) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\n$$ = 0.02 \\exp(-0.14) \\int_2^3 \\exp(-0.05(u-2)) \\, \\mathrm{d}u $$\n$$ = 0.02 \\exp(-0.14) \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-0.05(u-2))}{-0.05} \\right]_2^3 $$\n$$ = -\\frac{0.02}{0.05} \\exp(-0.14) (\\exp(-0.05(3-2)) - \\exp(-0.05(2-2))) $$\n$$ = -0.4 \\exp(-0.14) (\\exp(-0.05) - 1) = 0.4 \\exp(-0.14) (1 - \\exp(-0.05)) $$\n\n**Total Cumulative Incidence at $t=3$ years**\nWe sum the two parts:\n$$ I_A(3) = \\frac{5}{7} (1 - \\exp(-0.14)) + 0.4 \\exp(-0.14) (1 - \\exp(-0.05)) $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\exp(-0.14) \\approx 0.869358 $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.951229 $$\n$$ I_A(3) \\approx \\frac{5}{7} (1 - 0.869358) + 0.4(0.869358)(1 - 0.951229) $$\n$$ I_A(3) \\approx \\frac{5}{7} (0.130642) + 0.4(0.869358)(0.048771) $$\n$$ I_A(3) \\approx 0.093316 + 0.016935 \\approx 0.110251 $$\nTo three decimal places, the $3$-year probability of event $A$ is $0.110$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. When competing risks exist and the estimand is the absolute probability of a specific event by time $t$, CIF should be used because treating other event types as censored in Kaplan–Meier overestimates risk. The $3$-year probability of event $A$ is approximately $0.110$.**\n- **Justification:** The conceptual part is entirely correct. In a competing risks setting, the CIF is the proper estimator for absolute risk. The standard Kaplan-Meier (KM) approach, if used naively by treating competing events as censored, estimates the risk in a hypothetical scenario where competing risks are eliminated. Because the KM method doesn't account for subjects being removed from the risk pool by competing events, it leads to an overestimation of the probability of the event of interest. The numerical calculation matches our derived value of $I_A(3) \\approx 0.110$.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Kaplan–Meier is appropriate regardless of competing risks if competing events are treated as censored. The $3$-year probability of event $A$ is $1-\\exp\\!\\big(-[0.05 \\times 2 + 0.02 \\times 1]\\big)\\approx 0.113$.**\n- **Justification:** The theoretical claim is false. The naive KM approach is not appropriate for estimating absolute risk in the presence of competing risks. The calculation shown is for $1 - \\exp(-\\int_0^3 \\lambda_A(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u)$, which is the risk in the absence of competing events. The integral is $\\int_0^2 0.05\\,\\mathrm{d}u + \\int_2^3 0.02\\,\\mathrm{d}u = 0.10 + 0.02 = 0.12$. The value $1-\\exp(-0.12) \\approx 0.113$ is calculated correctly for this wrong quantity.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. CIF is only appropriate if hazards are constant over all time; otherwise, one should approximate the $3$-year probability of event $A$ by $\\int_0^3 \\lambda_A(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u = 0.12$.**\n- **Justification:** The first premise is false; the CIF method is general and not restricted to constant hazards. The second premise is also false; the integral of the cause-specific hazard, $\\int \\lambda_A(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u$, is the cumulative cause-specific hazard, not the probability (CIF). This quantity ignores the reduction in the at-risk population due to all events, including competing ones. The calculation of the integral is correct ($\\int_0^3 \\lambda_A(u) \\, \\mathrm{d}u = 0.12$), but it does not represent the desired probability.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. CIF is unnecessary when any event precludes the disease; the $3$-year probability of event $A$ is $1-\\exp\\!\\big(-[(0.05+0.02)\\times 2 + (0.02+0.03)\\times 1]\\big)\\approx 0.173$.**\n- **Justification:** The premise, \"CIF is unnecessary when any event precludes the disease,\" is the definition of a competing risks setting, which is precisely where CIF is necessary. The statement is backward and thus false. The calculation shown computes $1-S(3) = 1-\\exp(-\\int_0^3 \\lambda_{all}(u)\\,\\mathrm{d}u)$. The integral is $\\int_0^2 0.07\\,\\mathrm{d}u + \\int_2^3 0.05\\,\\mathrm{d}u = 0.14 + 0.05 = 0.19$. The value $1-\\exp(-0.19) \\approx 0.173$ is correct for this quantity. However, this is the probability of experiencing *any* event (A or B), not the probability of event A specifically.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
