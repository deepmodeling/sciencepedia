            "problem": "An ecologic study is conducted across $G=5$ regions to compare all-cause mortality relative to a national standard using indirect standardization. For each region $g \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, investigators have the observed number of deaths $O_g$ and the expected number of deaths $E_g$, where $E_g$ is computed by applying national age-specific mortality rates to the age structure of region $g$. The data are:\n- Region $1$: $O_1 = 145$, $E_1 = 130$\n- Region $2$: $O_2 = 98$, $E_2 = 110$\n- Region $3$: $O_3 = 210$, $E_3 = 190$\n- Region $4$: $O_4 = 75$, $E_4 = 95$\n- Region $5$: $O_5 = 160$, $E_5 = 175$\n\nUsing the fundamental definition of indirect standardization and the concept of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), do the following:\n1.

Derive an expression for the pooled SMR and compute its value.\n- The final answer is to be the pooled SMR, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard application of fundamental epidemiological methods (indirect standardization and SMR). The data are complete and consistent, and the terminology is unambiguous. The problem structure is sound, leading to a unique, verifiable solution. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of mortality data from $G=5$ regions using the concept of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR).\n\n**Part 1: Region-Specific SMR and Interpretation**\n\nThe SMR for a given population (or region $g$) is defined as the ratio of the total number of observed deaths ($O_g$) to the total number of expected deaths ($E_g$). The expected deaths are calculated by applying the age-specific mortality rates from a standard population (in this case, the national population) to the age structure of the study population (region $g$). The formula is:\n$$ SMR_g = \\frac{O_g}{E_g} $$\nAn $SMR$ value of $1$ indicates that the mortality in the study population is the same as in the standard population, after accounting for age differences. An $SMR > 1$ indicates excess mortality (excess risk), while an $SMR  1$ indicates lower-than-expected mortality (deficit risk or protective effect).\n\nWe calculate the SMR for each of the $G=5$ regions using the provided data.\n\nFor Region $1$:\n$$ SMR_1 = \\frac{O_1}{E_1} = \\frac{145}{130} \\approx 1.1154 $$\nSince $SMR_1 > 1$, Region $1$ experienced approximately $11.5\\%$ more deaths than would be expected based on national rates, indicating an excess mortality risk.\n\nFor Region $2$:\n$$ SMR_2 = \\frac{O_2}{E_2} = \\frac{98}{110} \\approx 0.8909 $$\nSince $SMR_2  1$, Region $2$ experienced approximately $10.9\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a deficit risk.\n\nFor Region $3$:\n$$ SMR_3 = \\frac{O_3}{E_3} = \\frac{210}{190} \\approx 1.1053 $$\nSince $SMR_3 > 1$, Region $3$ experienced approximately $10.5\\%$ more deaths than expected, indicating an excess mortality risk.\n\nFor Region $4$:\n$$ SMR_4 = \\frac{O_4}{E_4} = \\frac{75}{95} \\approx 0.7895 $$\nSince $SMR_4  1$, Region $4$ experienced approximately $21.1\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a significant deficit risk.\n\nFor Region $5$:\n$$ SMR_5 = \\frac{O_5}{E_5} = \\frac{160}{175} \\approx 0.9143 $$\nSince $SMR_5  1$, Region $5$ experienced approximately $8.6\\%$ fewer deaths than expected, indicating a deficit risk.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Computation of the Pooled SMR**\n\nThe second task is to derive, from first principles, an expression for the pooled SMR across all regions and to compute its value. The \"first principle\" for pooling SMRs is to treat the combined regions as a single, larger population. The SMR for this combined population is the ratio of the total observed deaths across all regions to the total expected deaths across all regions.\n\nLet $O_{total}$ be the sum of observed deaths and $E_{total}$ be the sum of expected deaths over all $G$ regions.\n$$ O_{total} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} O_g $$\n$$ E_{total} = \\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g $$\nThe pooled SMR, denoted $SMR_{pooled}$, is then defined as:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{O_{total}}{E_{total}} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} O_g}{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g} $$\nThis formula represents a weighted average of the individual region SMRs, where the weights are the expected number of deaths in each region, $E_g$:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} (SMR_g \\cdot E_g)}{\\sum_{g=1}^{G} E_g} $$\nThis derivation from the principle of aggregation is fundamental.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the given data for $G=5$.\nFirst, we calculate the total observed deaths:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{5} O_g = O_1 + O_2 + O_3 + O_4 + O_5 = 145 + 98 + 210 + 75 + 160 = 688 $$\nNext, we calculate the total expected deaths:\n$$ \\sum_{g=1}^{5} E_g = E_1 + E_2 + E_3 + E_4 + E_5 = 130 + 110 + 190 + 95 + 175 = 700 $$\nNow, we can compute the pooled SMR:\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{688}{700} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures.\n$$ SMR_{pooled} = \\frac{688}{700} \\approx 0.98285714... $$\nThe first four significant figures are $9$, $8$, $2$, and $8$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ SMR_{pooled} \\approx 0.9829 $$\nThe pooled SMR is less than $1$, indicating that, overall, the combined five regions have a slightly lower mortality rate (approximately $1.7\\%$ lower) than the national standard, after accounting for age structure.",

This is a clear positive ecologic association. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion $3$: Numerical Self-Consistency.**\n    The problem states there are \"two equally sized individual subgroups\" in each region. The regional average should be the mean of the subgroups.\n    -   $\\mathrm{L1}$: Average income = $(40 + 60)/2 = 50$. Average life expectancy = $(79 + 77)/2 = 78$.

This is consistent.\n    This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion $2$: Null or Negative Individual-Level Association.**\n    We must examine the association within the cost-of-living strata. The data is provided for each region, which implicitly allows us to check within the low-cost stratum ($\\mathrm{L1}$, $\\mathrm{L2}$) and the high-cost stratum ($\\mathrm{H1}$, $\\mathrm{H2}$).\n    -   **Within Low-Cost Regions:**\n        -   In region $\\mathrm{L1}$: income increases from $40$ to $60$, while life expectancy decreases from $79$ to $77$. This is a negative association.\n        -   In region $\\mathrm{L2}$: income increases from $45$ to $65$, while life expectancy decreases from $80$ to $78$. This is a negative association.\n    -   **Within High-Cost Regions:**\n        -   In region $\\mathrm{H1}$: income increases from $75$ to $95$, while life expectancy decreases from $83$ to $81$.

This is a negative association.\n    In every case, within each region (and thus within each stratum), a higher individual nominal income is associated with a lower life expectancy. This is a negative individual-level association. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n-   **Verdict for Option A:** All three criteria are met. Option A provides a perfectly self-consistent dataset that demonstrates a positive ecologic association coexisting with a negative individual-level association, a classic example of Simpson's paradox due to confounding. **Correct**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option B\n\n-   **Criterion $1$: Positive Ecologic Association.**\n    The region-level data points are: $\\mathrm{R1}: (50, 78)$, $\\mathrm{R2}: (60, 80)$, $\\mathrm{R3}: (70, 82)$, $\\mathrm{R4}: (80, 84)$. As income increases, life expectancy increases. This criterion is **satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion $2$: Null or Negative Individual-Level Association.**\n    The option states: \"In every region, higher individual nominal income is associated with higher life expectancy by about $+2$ years per $+10$ nominal income.\" This describes a *positive* individual-level association. The problem requires a null or negative individual-level association. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n-   **Verdict for Option B:** This option describes a scenario where the ecologic and individual-level associations are in the same direction (concordant). It does not demonstrate the required paradox. **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option C\n\n-   **Criterion $1$: Positive Ecologic Association.**\n    The region-level data points are: $\\mathrm{L1}: (55, 79)$, $\\mathrm{L2}: (60, 79)$, $\\mathrm{H1}: (85, 80)$, $\\mathrm{H2}: (90, 80)$. The life expectancy barely changes (from $79$ to $80$) as income increases substantially (from $55$ to $90$). The option itself states, \"the ecologic association across regions is approximately zero.\" The problem requires a *positive* association. A null or near-null association does not meet this condition. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion $2$: Null or Negative Individual-Level Association.**\n    The option states that within each stratum, the association is negative ($-2$ years per $+10$ income). This part of the condition would be met.\n\n-   **Verdict for Option C:** This option fails to provide the required positive ecologic association. **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Evaluation of Option D\n\n-   **Criterion $1$: Positive Ecologic Association.**\n    The region-level data points are: $\\mathrm{L1}: (50, 80)$, $\\mathrm{L2}: (55, 80)$, $\\mathrm{H1}: (85, 80)$, $\\mathrm{H2}: (90, 80)$. The average life expectancy is constant at $80$ across all regions, regardless of average income. The ecologic association is exactly zero (null). The problem requires a *positive* association. This criterion is **not satisfied**.\n\n-   **Criterion $2$: Null or Negative Individual-Level Association.**\n    The option states: \"No relationship between individual nominal income and life expectancy within any region (flat).\" This is a null association, which is permitted by the problem's \"null or negative\" requirement. This part of the condition would be met.\n\n-   **Additional Flaw:** The option concludes that cost of living is not a confounder because it does not relate to life expectancy. This is a correct interpretation of the provided data, as a confounder must be associated with the outcome. Since the average life expectancy is $80$ in both low-cost and high-cost strata, there is no association between cost of living and life expectancy. Therefore, this dataset does not represent confounding by cost of living, which is the mechanism the problem seeks to illustrate.\n\n-   **Verdict for Option D:** This option fails to provide the required positive ecologic association. It also describes a situation where there is no confounding by the proposed variable, contrary to the premise of the question. **Incorrect**.",
