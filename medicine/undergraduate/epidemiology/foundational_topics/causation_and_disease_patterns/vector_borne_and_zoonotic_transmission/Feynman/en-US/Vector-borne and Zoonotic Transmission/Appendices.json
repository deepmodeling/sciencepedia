            "solution": "The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the expected number of secondary human infections generated by a single infectious human in a completely susceptible population. The transmission cycle is from Human $\\to$ Vector $\\to$ Human. We can derive the expression for $R_0$ by decomposing the cycle into two parts.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of vectors that become infectious from a single infectious human.\nThe rate at which a single infectious human produces new vector infections is the product of the number of vectors per human, $m$, the per-vector biting rate, $a$, and the probability of transmission per bite to the vector, $c$. The rate is $mac$.\nThe infectious human remains in the infectious state for an average duration of $\\frac{1}{r+\\mu}$, where $r$ is the recovery rate and $\\mu$ is the human mortality rate.\nFor an infected vector to become infectious, it must survive the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of $n$ days. The probability of surviving one day is $p$, so the probability of surviving $n$ days is $p^n$.\nTherefore, the expected number of vectors that become infectious from a single primary human case is:\n$$N_{V \\leftarrow H} = (mac) \\times \\frac{1}{r+\\mu} \\times p^n = \\frac{m a c p^n}{r+\\mu}$$\n\nSecond, we determine the expected number of secondary human infections generated by a single infectious vector over its lifetime.\nOnce a vector becomes infectious (after surviving the EIP), it remains so for the rest of its life. The daily mortality rate of the vector, $\\gamma_v$, is related to the daily survival probability $p$ by $p = \\exp(-\\gamma_v)$, so $\\gamma_v = -\\ln(p)$. The expected infectious lifetime of the vector is $\\frac{1}{\\gamma_v} = \\frac{1}{-\\ln(p)}$.\nDuring this infectious lifetime, the vector bites humans at a rate $a$. Each bite on a susceptible human has a probability $b$ of causing infection.\nThus, the total number of humans infected by a single infectious vector is:\n$$N_{H \\leftarrow V} = a \\cdot b \\cdot \\frac{1}{-\\ln(p)} = \\frac{ab}{-\\ln(p)}$$\n\nThe basic reproduction number $R_0$ is the product of these two quantities:\n$$R_0 = N_{V \\leftarrow H} \\times N_{H \\leftarrow V} = \\left( \\frac{m a c p^n}{r+\\mu} \\right) \\left( \\frac{ab}{-\\ln(p)} \\right) = \\frac{m a^2 b c p^n}{(r+\\mu)(-\\ln(p))}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values: $m=4$, $a=0.3$, $b=0.5$, $c=0.4$, $p=0.85$, $n=12$, $r=0.2$, and $\\mu=0.1$.\n$$R_0 = \\frac{4 \\cdot (0.3)^2 \\cdot 0.5 \\cdot 0.4 \\cdot (0.85)^{12}}{(0.2+0.1) \\cdot (-\\ln(0.85))}$$\n$$R_0 = \\frac{0.072 \\cdot (0.85)^{12}}{0.3 \\cdot (-\\ln(0.85))}$$\n$$R_0 \\approx \\frac{0.072 \\cdot 0.1422417}{0.3 \\cdot 0.1625189} \\approx \\frac{0.0102414}{0.0487557} \\approx 0.210058$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R_0 \\approx 0.2101$.\n\nThe condition for sustained transmission is $R_0 > 1$.

The basic reproduction number, denoted by $R_0$, quantifies the expected number of secondary human infections produced by a single infectious human in a fully susceptible population. In this framework, the parameters are defined as follows: $m$ is the mosquito-to-human ratio, $a$ is the mosquito biting rate per day, $b$ is the probability of transmission from mosquito to human per bite, $c$ is the probability of transmission from human to mosquito per bite, $p$ is the daily survival probability of the mosquito, $n$ is the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) in days, $r$ is the per capita recovery rate of humans per day, and $\\mu$ is the instantaneous per capita mortality rate of mosquitoes per day.

The framework is the Ross–Macdonald model.\n\nFirst, we must establish the formula for the basic reproduction number, $R_0$, using the parameters provided. $R_0$ is defined as the product of the number of mosquitoes infected by a single infectious human and the number of humans infected by a single infectious mosquito.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- $m$: mosquito-to-human ratio\n- $a$: mosquito biting rate per day\n- $b$: probability of transmission from mosquito to human per bite\n- $c$: probability of transmission from human to mosquito per bite\n- $p$: daily survival probability of the mosquito\n- $n$: extrinsic incubation period (EIP) in days\n- $r$: per capita recovery rate of humans per day\n- $\\mu$: instantaneous per capita mortality rate of mosquitoes per day\n\nThe average infectious period for a human is $1/r$. The number of mosquitoes that bite an infectious human during this period is $m \\times a \\times (1/r)$. The number of these mosquitoes that become infected is $m \\times a \\times c \\times (1/r)$.\n\nAn infected mosquito must survive the extrinsic incubation period of $n$ days to become infectious. The probability of surviving this period is $p^n$. The instantaneous mortality rate $\\mu$ is related to the daily survival probability $p$ by $\\mu = -\\ln(p)$. The average lifespan of a mosquito is $1/\\mu$. Thus, the expected duration of infectiousness for a mosquito that survives the EIP is also $1/\\mu$.

            "problem": "A vector-borne zoonosis circulates in a wildlife reservoir and occasionally spills over to humans via a hematophagous vector. Assume a homogeneous environment with two host classes only: humans and the wildlife reservoir. Each vector takes $a$ bites per vector per day, survives day-to-day with probability $s$, and requires $n$ days of extrinsic incubation before it becomes infectious after acquiring the pathogen. On any bite, the vector chooses a human with probability $p_{h}$ and a reservoir host with probability $p_{r}$, with $p_{h}+p_{r}=1$. Let $m$ denote vectors per human, $b_{vh}$ the per-bite transmission probability from an infectious vector to a human, $b_{vr}$ the per-bite probability that a susceptible vector acquires infection from an infectious reservoir host, and $\\pi_{r}$ the prevalence of infectious hosts in the reservoir.\n\nUse only the following foundational facts to build your derivation:\n1. The human force of infection (FOI) $\\lambda_{h}$ is the product of the per-vector biting rate on humans, the per-bite transmission probability to humans, the vector-to-human ratio, and the fraction of vectors that are infectious at a given time.\n2. The fraction of vectors that are infectious at a given time equals the incidence rate at which susceptible vectors become infectious multiplied by the mean duration they remain infectious, adjusted for the necessity of surviving the extrinsic incubation period.\n3. For a vector with independent daily survival probability $s$, the probability of surviving $n$ days is $s^{n}$, and conditional on being alive at a given day, the expected remaining lifespan in days is $s/(1-s)$.\n\nBefore any intervention, the system parameters are:\n- $a=0.3$ bites per vector per day,\n- $m=5$ vectors per human,\n- $b_{vh}=0.1$,\n- $b_{vr}=0.2$,\n- $s=0.9$,\n- $n=10$ days,\n- $p_{h,0}=0.2$ so $p_{r,0}=0.8$,\n- reservoir infectious prevalence $\\pi_{r,0}=0.2$.\n\nAn intervention is implemented that vaccinates the reservoir, reducing its infectious prevalence to $\\pi_{r,1}=0.05$. Due to changes in host availability, the vector feeding preference for humans increases to $p_{h,1}=0.3$ so $p_{r,1}=0.7$. All other parameters remain unchanged.\n\nStarting from the foundational facts listed above and without invoking any additional pre-packaged formulas, derive an expression for the multiplicative change in human spillover FOI, defined as the ratio $R=\\lambda_{h,1}/\\lambda_{h,0}$ after versus before the intervention, and then compute its numerical value under the given parameters.

According to Foundational Fact 1, $\\lambda_h$ is the product of four terms:\n1.  The per-vector biting rate on humans: This is the total biting rate per vector, $a$, multiplied by the probability of choosing a human host, $p_h$. The rate is $a p_h$.\n2.  The per-bite transmission probability from an infectious vector to a human: This is given as $b_{vh}$.\n3.  The vector-to-human ratio: This is given as $m$.\n4.

The rate of new vector infections is given by the vector's biting rate on the reservoir ($a p_r$), the prevalence of infection in the reservoir ($\\pi_r$), and the probability of acquisition ($b_{vr}$). Assuming most vectors are susceptible, the incidence rate of new infections among vectors is $a p_r \\pi_r b_{vr}$.\n\nFor a newly infected vector to become infectious, it must survive the EIP of $n$ days. Based on Foundational Fact 3, this probability is $s^n$.\nThe daily mortality rate of vectors is $(1-s)$.
