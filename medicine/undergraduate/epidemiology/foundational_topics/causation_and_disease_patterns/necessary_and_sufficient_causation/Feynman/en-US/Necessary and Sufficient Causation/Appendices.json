This exercise uses data from a hypothetical vaccine trial to demonstrate how, under a specific assumption called monotonicity, the proportion of cases attributable to an exposure is identical to the Probability of Necessity ($PN$). This practice provides a solid foundation by linking an intuitive statistical quantity to the deeper logic of the potential outcomes framework .",

            "problem": "A vaccine candidate is evaluated for its causal effect on infection in a randomized, individually randomized trial with no interference between participants, satisfying the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). Let $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate receipt of the vaccine ($X=1$ for vaccinated, $X=0$ for unvaccinated), and let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate infection within $30$ days ($Y=1$ for infected, $Y=0$ otherwise). Denote the potential outcomes by $Y_{1}$ and $Y_{0}$, representing infection status if vaccinated or unvaccinated, respectively.

The concepts of SUTVA, exchangeability, potential outcomes, risk, attributable fraction, probability of necessity, and probability of sufficiency are all well-established. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The scenario where a \"vaccine candidate\" increases risk ($p_1 > p_0$) is scientifically plausible (e.g., antibody-dependent enhancement) and serves as a valid context to apply causal measures for harmful exposures. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not incomplete or contradictory, and is not trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first task is to derive a symbolic expression for the attributable fraction among the exposed, $AF_e$, and compute its value. The problem defines $AF_e$ as \"the proportion of infection cases among vaccinated participants that would not have occurred had they instead been unvaccinated\".\n\nLet's formalize this definition. The group of interest is the vaccinated participants, i.e., those with $X=1$. The risk of infection in this group is $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)$. Due to randomization, the observed risk in the treated group is an unbiased estimator of the risk had everyone been treated, so $P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_1=1) = p_1$. This is the total risk of infection among the vaccinated.\n\nThe risk of infection that *would have occurred* in this same group of people had they been unvaccinated is a counterfactual quantity. For the group in which $X=1$ was assigned, their risk had they been assigned $X=0$ is given by $P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=1)$. Because randomization makes the potential outcomes independent of treatment assignment (exchangeability), we have $P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_0=1) = p_0$.\n\nThe \"excess risk\" among the vaccinated—the portion of the risk that is due to the vaccination—is the difference between the observed risk and the counterfactual risk: $p_1 - p_0$.\n\nThe attributable fraction among the exposed, $AF_e$, is this excess risk expressed as a proportion of the total risk among the exposed.\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{exposed}} - \\text{Counterfactual Risk}_{\\text{exposed}}}{\\text{Risk}_{\\text{exposed}}} = \\frac{P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) - P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=1)}{P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)}\n$$\nUsing the identities derived from the randomization assumption:\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_1} = 1 - \\frac{p_0}{p_1}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for $AF_e$.\n\nNow, we compute its value using the given data $p_1 = 0.5$ and $p_0 = 0.2$.\n$$\nAF_e = \\frac{0.5 - 0.2}{0.5} = \\frac{0.3}{0.5} = 0.6\n$$\nThis means that $60\\%$ of the infections observed in the vaccinated group are attributable to the vaccine candidate itself.\n\nNext, we relate $AF_e$ to the Probability of Necessity ($PN$) under the assumption of monotonicity. Monotonicity here means $Y_1 \\geq Y_0$ for every individual, which implies that the vaccine candidate does not prevent infection for anyone; it can only have no effect or cause an infection. This rules out the existence of individuals for whom $(Y_1=0, Y_0=1)$, so $P(Y_1=0, Y_0=1) = 0$.\n\nThe Probability of Necessity ($PN$) is defined as the probability that the exposure was a necessary cause of the outcome for an individual who was exposed and had the outcome. Formally:\n$$\nPN = P(Y_0=0 \\mid X=1, Y=1)\n$$\nBy the consistency assumption ($Y=Y_X$), for those with $X=1$, $Y=1$ implies $Y_1=1$. By exchangeability, potential outcomes are independent of $X$. Thus:\n$$\nPN = P(Y_0=0 \\mid Y_1=1) = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)}{P(Y_1=1)}\n$$\nThe denominator is $P(Y_1=1) = p_1$. The numerator, $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)$, is the probability of the joint potential outcome corresponding to individuals for whom the vaccine causes infection. This term is generally not identifiable from the marginal probabilities $p_1$ and $p_0$ alone.\n\nHowever, with the monotonicity assumption ($P(Y_1=0, Y_0=1)=0$), we can identify this term. We know:\n$$\np_0 = P(Y_0=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1) + P(Y_1=0, Y_0=1)\n$$\nUnder monotonicity, this simplifies to $p_0 = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$.\nFurthermore, we have:\n$$\np_1 = P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)\n$$\nSubstituting $p_0$ for $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$, we get:\n$$\np_1 = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + p_0 \\implies P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) = p_1 - p_0\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this identified probability back into the expression for $PN$:\n$$\nPN = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_1}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that under the assumption of monotonicity, the Probability of Necessity ($PN$) is identical to the attributable fraction among the exposed ($AF_e$).\n\nFinally, we briefly explain the Probability of Sufficiency ($PS$). $PS$ addresses the question of whether the exposure is a sufficient cause for the outcome among those not fated to have it. It is the probability that an individual who would not have been infected without the vaccine ($Y_0=0$) becomes infected upon receiving it ($Y_1=1$).\n$$\nPS = P(Y_1=1 \\mid Y_0=0)\n$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, we can write its symbolic form:\n$$\nPS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)}{P(Y_0=0)}\n$$\nThe denominator is $P(Y_0=0) = 1 - P(Y_0=1) = 1 - p_0$. The numerator, as shown before, is identified as $p_1 - p_0$ under the monotonicity assumption. Therefore, under monotonicity, the symbolic expression for $PS$ is:\n$$\nPS = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{1 - p_0}\n$$\nThis quantity represents the risk of vaccine-induced infection among the sub-population that is susceptible to it (i.e., those who would not have been infected otherwise).\n\nThe problem, however, asks only for the final computed value of $AF_e$.",

The observed risks are $p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = 0.35$ in the exposed arm and $p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = 0.10$ in the unexposed arm. Work within the potential outcomes framework with potential outcomes $Y_1$ and $Y_0$, and assume the following foundational conditions: (i) randomization implies $X \\perp (Y_0,Y_1)$, (ii) the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds so that $Y = Y_X$, and (iii) monotonicity (no preventers) holds, so $Y_1 \\ge Y_0$ almost surely.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and the core definitions of the probabilities of necessity, sufficiency, and necessity-and-sufficiency, where\n- the probability of necessity is $PN = P(Y_0 = 0 \\mid X=1, Y=1)$,\n- the probability of sufficiency is $PS = P(Y_1 = 1 \\mid X=0, Y=0)$,\n- the probability of necessity-and-sufficiency is $PNS = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)$,\n\nfirst derive expressions for $PN$, $PS$, and $PNS$ in terms of $p_1$ and $p_0$ under the stated assumptions, and then evaluate them for $p_1=0.35$ and $p_0=0.10$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and evaluation of three causal quantities—the probability of necessity ($PN$), the probability of sufficiency ($PS$), and the probability of necessity-and-sufficiency ($PNS$)—from data from a randomized trial under the potential outcomes framework.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationship between the observed risks and the potential outcomes. The problem provides the observed risk in the exposed arm, $p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1)$, and in the unexposed arm, $p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0)$.\n\nUnder the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), an individual's observed outcome $Y$ is equal to their potential outcome under the exposure they actually received, i.e., $Y = Y_X$. This allows us to write:\n$p_1 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_1=1 \\mid X=1)$\n$p_0 = P(Y=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=0)$\n\nThe assumption of randomization, $X \\perp (Y_0, Y_1)$, implies that the exposure assignment is independent of the potential outcomes. This allows us to remove the conditioning on $X$:\n$P(Y_1=1 \\mid X=1) = P(Y_1=1)$\n$P(Y_0=1 \\mid X=0) = P(Y_0=1)$\n\nCombining these results, we establish the fundamental connection between the observable probabilities and the unobservable potential outcome probabilities:\n$p_1 = P(Y_1=1)$\n$p_0 = P(Y_0=1)$\n\nThe third crucial assumption is monotonicity, $Y_1 \\ge Y_0$, which states that the exposure does not prevent the outcome for any individual. This implies that the potential outcome pair $(Y_1=0, Y_0=1)$ cannot occur, so $P(Y_1=0, Y_0=1) = 0$. Consequently, the event $\\{Y_0=1\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{Y_1=1\\}$, meaning that anyone who would have the outcome without exposure must also have it with exposure. This leads to the identity $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1) = P(Y_0=1) = p_0$.\n\nNow we derive the expressions for $PNS$, $PN$, and $PS$.\n\n**1. Probability of Necessity-and-Sufficiency ($PNS$)**\n$PNS$ is defined as $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)$. This is the unconditional probability of an individual for whom the exposure is both a necessary cause (they would not have the outcome without it, $Y_0=0$) and a sufficient cause (they would have the outcome with it, $Y_1=1$). This group is often called \"compliers\" or the \"causally-affected\" subgroup.\nWe can express $P(Y_1=1)$ using the law of total probability, partitioning on the value of $Y_0$:\n$P(Y_1=1) = P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) + P(Y_1=1, Y_0=1)$\nSubstituting the known quantities:\n$p_1 = PNS + P(Y_0=1)$\n$p_1 = PNS + p_0$\nSolving for $PNS$, we get:\n$PNS = p_1 - p_0$\n\nFor the given values $p_1 = 0.35$ and $p_0 = 0.10$:\n$PNS = 0.35 - 0.10 = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$\n\n**2. Probability of Necessity ($PN$)**\n$PN$ is defined as $P(Y_0 = 0 \\mid X=1, Y=1)$.

Probability of Sufficiency ($PS$)**\n$PS$ is defined as $P(Y_1 = 1 \\mid X=0, Y=0)$. This represents the probability that the exposure would have been sufficient to cause the outcome, for an individual who was not exposed and did not develop the outcome.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, X=0, Y=0)}{P(X=0, Y=0)}$\nApplying SUTVA, the event $\\{X=0, Y=0\\}$ is equivalent to $\\{X=0, Y_0=0\\}$. The numerator event becomes $\\{Y_1=1, X=0, Y_0=0\\}$.\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0, X=0)}{P(Y_0=0, X=0)}$\nBy randomization, $X$ is independent of $(Y_0, Y_1)$:\n$PS = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)P(X=0)}{P(Y_0=0)P(X=0)} = \\frac{P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0)}{P(Y_0=0)}$\nWe know $P(Y_1=1, Y_0=0) = PNS = p_1 - p_0$. The denominator is $P(Y_0=0) = 1 - P(Y_0=1) = 1 - p_0$.\nTherefore, the expression for $PS$ is:\n$PS = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{1 - p_0}$\n\nFor the given values:\n$PS = \\frac{0.35 - 0.10}{1 - 0.10} = \\frac{0.25}{0.90} = \\frac{25}{90} = \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nIn summary, the derived expressions are:\n$PNS = p_1 - p_0$\n$PN = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_1}$\n$PS = \\frac{p_1 - p_0}{1 - p_0}$\n\nAnd their numerical values are:\n$PNS = \\frac{1}{4}$\n$PN = \\frac{5}{7}$\n$PS = \\frac{5}{18}$\n\nThe final answer is required as a row matrix in the order $(PN, PS, PNS)$.",

Let $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ represent the true counts in the cells $(E=1, Y=1)$, $(E=1, Y=0)$, $(E=0, Y=1)$, and $(E=0, Y=0)$ respectively.

Substituting this into the first equation:\n$$1840 = 0.9b + 0.05(4600 - b)$$\n$$1840 = 0.9b + 230 - 0.05b$$\n$$1610 = 0.85b$$\n$$b = \\frac{1610}{0.85} = \\frac{161000}{85} = \\frac{32200}{17}$$\nThen, the true number of unexposed noncases is:\n$$d = 4600 - \\frac{32200}{17} = \\frac{78200 - 32200}{17} = \\frac{46000}{17}$$\n\nNow we have the corrected (true) counts:\n$a = N(E=1, Y=1) = \\frac{4400}{17}$\n$b = N(E=1, Y=0) = \\frac{32200}{17}$\n$c = N(E=0, Y=1) = \\frac{2400}{17}$\n$d = N(E=0, Y=0) = \\frac{46000}{17}$\n\nWith these true counts, we can calculate the true risks in the exposed ($R_1$) and unexposed ($R_0$) populations.\nThe total number of truly exposed individuals is $N_{E=1} = a + b = \\frac{4400}{17} + \\frac{32200}{17} = \\frac{36600}{17}$.\nThe total number of truly unexposed individuals is $N_{E=0} = c + d = \\frac{2400}{17} + \\frac{46000}{17} = \\frac{48400}{17}$.\n\nThe true risk among the exposed is:\n$$R_1 = P(Y=1|E=1) = \\frac{a}{a+b} = \\frac{4400/17}{36600/17} = \\frac{4400}{36600} = \\frac{44}{366} = \\frac{22}{183}$$\nThe true risk among the unexposed is:\n$$R_0 = P(Y=1|E=0) = \\frac{c}{c+d} = \\frac{2400/17}{48400/17} = \\frac{2400}{48400} = \\frac{24}{484} = \\frac{6}{121}$$\n\nThe attributable fraction among the exposed, $AF_{e}$, is defined as the proportion of risk in the exposed group that is due to the exposure:\n$$AF_{e} = \\frac{R_1 - R_0}{R_1} = 1 - \\frac{R_0}{R_1}$$\nSubstituting the corrected risks:\n$$AF_{e} = 1 - \\frac{6/121}{22/183} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{6}{121} \\cdot \\frac{183}{22}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{3}{121} \\cdot \\frac{183}{11}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{549}{1331}$$\n$$AF_{e} = \\frac{1331 - 549}{1331} = \\frac{782}{1331}$$\n\nThe problem states that under the assumptions of no unmeasured confounding, consistency, positivity, and monotonicity of the exposure effect, the $AF_{e}$ is a valid estimator for the probability of necessity, $PN = P(Y_{e=0}=0|Y=1, E=1)$. This is a standard result in causal inference. The condition of monotonicity ensures that we can interpret the excess risk $R_1 - R_0$ as representing the proportion of individuals for whom the exposure was a necessary cause of the disease. Therefore, $PN = AF_e$.\n\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$PN = AF_e = \\frac{782}{1331} \\approx 0.58752817...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5875$.",
