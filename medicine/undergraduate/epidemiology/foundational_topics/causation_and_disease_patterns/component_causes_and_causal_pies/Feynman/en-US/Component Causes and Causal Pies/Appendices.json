This exercise guides you through a first-principles derivation of the \"necessary cause fraction\" using data from an idealized randomized controlled trial. By understanding how the risk difference ($I_{1} - I_{0}$) directly isolates the proportion of individuals for whom a component cause is necessary, you will build a foundational link between the causal pie model and practical public health metrics .",

            "problem": "Consider the sufficient-cause (causal pies) framework for a binary disease outcome over a fixed follow-up period. A \"sufficient cause\" is defined as a minimal set of \"component causes\" whose joint occurrence is sufficient to produce the disease within the time window of interest. A \"component cause\" is any individual element of a sufficient cause. For a given individual, a particular component cause $C$ is \"necessary\" if every sufficient cause that could produce that individual's disease within the time window includes $C$.\n\nSuppose a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) is conducted in a population where $C$ is believed to be involved in at least some sufficient causes. Individuals are randomly assigned at baseline either to an intervention that entirely eliminates $C$ for the duration of follow-up without affecting the occurrence of other component causes, or to a control condition in which $C$ is left unaltered. Let $I_{1}$ denote the cumulative incidence of the disease in the control arm over the follow-up period, and let $I_{0}$ denote the cumulative incidence in the intervention arm over the same period. Assume the trial satisfies consistency, exchangeability, and positivity, and assume monotonicity over the time window in the sense that eliminating $C$ cannot increase an individual's risk of disease during follow-up relative to leaving $C$ unaltered.\n\nUnder these conditions, derive from first principles an expression for the necessary cause fraction among cases in the population during the follow-up period—that is, the proportion of cases for whom $C$ was necessary—and then compute its value given $I_{1} = 0.24$ and $I_{0} = 0.09$. Express your final answer as a decimal, and no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the necessary cause fraction among cases from first principles within the sufficient-cause framework, and its calculation given specific incidence data from a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT).\n\nFirst, let us formalize the concepts outlined in the problem statement. The setting is an RCT where a population is randomized into two arms.\n-   Control arm ($X=1$): Component cause $C$ is left unaltered. The cumulative incidence of the disease is $I_{1}$.\n-   Intervention arm ($X=0$): Component cause $C$ is entirely eliminated. The cumulative incidence of the disease is $I_{0}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following critical assumptions:\n1.  **Exchangeability**: Because of randomization, the two arms are comparable on average with respect to all other factors that could cause the disease. This means the underlying risk profiles are the same in both groups, apart from the presence or absence of $C$.\n2.  **Consistency**: The observed outcome for an individual corresponds to the potential outcome under the exposure they actually received.\n3.  **Monotonicity**: The elimination of $C$ cannot cause the disease in any individual. That is, if an individual develops the disease when $C$ is absent, they would also have developed it if $C$ had been present.\n\nLet's use the potential outcomes framework to formalize the problem. Let $D_x$ be the potential outcome for disease for an individual, where $x$ indicates the exposure status. $D_{1}=1$ if the person gets the disease when $C$ is present (control condition), and $D_{1}=0$ otherwise. $D_{0}=1$ if the person gets the disease when $C$ is eliminated (intervention condition), and $D_{0}=0$ otherwise.\n\nDue to exchangeability and consistency, the observed incidences in the study arms are equal to the population probabilities of the corresponding potential outcomes:\n$$I_{1} = P(D = 1 | X=1) = P(D_{1}=1)$$\n$$I_{0} = P(D = 1 | X=0) = P(D_{0}=1)$$\n\nThe monotonicity assumption implies that for any individual in the population, $D_{0} \\le D_{1}$. This forbids the case where an individual would get the disease only when $C$ is eliminated (i.e., $D_{0}=1$ and $D_{1}=0$).\n\nThe population can be stratified into four mutually exclusive groups based on their potential outcome pairs $(D_{1}, D_{0})$:\n1.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1)$: These individuals develop the disease regardless of the presence of $C$. Their disease is caused by sufficient causes that do not include $C$.\n2.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$: These individuals develop the disease only if $C$ is present. For this group, $C$ is a necessary component of the sufficient cause that results in their disease within the follow-up period.\n3.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1)$: The monotonicity assumption ensures that the proportion of such individuals in the population is zero.\n4.  Individuals for whom $(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=0)$: These individuals do not develop the disease under either condition during the follow-up.\n\nThe incidence in the control arm, $I_{1}$, represents the total proportion of individuals who would get the disease if $C$ were present. This includes those who get sick regardless of $C$ and those who get sick only because of $C$.\n$$I_{1} = P(D_{1}=1) = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) + P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$$\n\nThe incidence in the intervention arm, $I_{0}$, represents the proportion of individuals who get the disease even when $C$ is eliminated. These are the individuals whose disease is caused by mechanisms not involving $C$.\n$$I_{0} = P(D_{0}=1) = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) + P(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1)$$\nBy the monotonicity assumption, $P(D_{1}=0, D_{0}=1) = 0$, so this simplifies to:\n$$I_{0} = P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1)$$\n\nThis term, $I_{0}$, represents the \"background\" incidence—the incidence due to sufficient causes that do not contain $C$.\n\nWe can now express the proportion of individuals for whom $C$ is a necessary component cause. These are the individuals corresponding to the stratum $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$.\n$$P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0) = I_{1} - P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=1) = I_{1} - I_{0}$$\nThis quantity, $I_{1} - I_{0}$, is the risk difference. It isolates the incidence of disease that is causally attributable to the presence of $C$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"necessary cause fraction among cases\". This is the proportion of individuals who develop the disease in the control condition (i.e., the \"cases\") for whom $C$ was a necessary cause. We can express this as a conditional probability:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = P(\\text{C is necessary} | \\text{Disease occurs}) $$\nIn our notation, this is the probability that an individual is of type $(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)$, given that they are a case, i.e., $D_{1}=1$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = P(D_{0}=0 | D_{1}=1) = \\frac{P(D_{1}=1, D_{0}=0)}{P(D_{1}=1)} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{I_{1} - I_{0}}{I_{1}} $$\nThis is the general expression for the necessary cause fraction among cases, also known as the attributable fraction or etiologic fraction.\n\nNow, we compute the value using the given data: $I_{1} = 0.24$ and $I_{0} = 0.09$.\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{0.24 - 0.09}{0.24} $$\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{0.15}{0.24} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = \\frac{15}{24} = \\frac{3 \\times 5}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{5}{8} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\text{Fraction} = 0.625 $$\nThus, among those who develop the disease in the population, $62.5\\%$ do so via a causal mechanism for which $C$ is a necessary component.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the lower bound on the fraction of disease cases among individuals with both exposures $A=1$ and $B=1$ that are attributable to a causal mechanism requiring the presence of both $A$ and $B$. We will solve this using the Sufficient-Component Cause (SCC) model, under the stated assumptions of no uncontrolled confounding and monotonicity.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem using the potential outcomes framework, which is a rigorous interpretation of the SCC model. Let $Y_{ab}$ denote the potential outcome for disease ($Y=1$ for disease, $Y=0$ for no disease) if an individual were exposed to level $a$ of factor $A$ and level $b$ of factor $B$, where $a, b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The assumption of no uncontrolled confounding allows us to equate the observed risk, $R_{ab}$, with the probability of the corresponding potential outcome in the population: $R_{ab} = P(Y_{ab}=1)$.\n\nThe assumption of monotonicity of effects for both $A$ and $B$ means that for any individual, exposure to either factor cannot prevent the disease. Formally, this means $Y_{1b} \\ge Y_{0b}$ and $Y_{a1} \\ge Y_{a0}$ for any $a, b \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. This constraint limits the possible types of individuals, defined by their vector of potential outcomes $(Y_{00}, Y_{10}, Y_{01}, Y_{11})$. The valid response types are:\n- Type I (Immune): $(0, 0, 0, 0)$. These individuals never get the disease.\n- Type D (Doomed): $(1, 1, 1, 1)$. These individuals always get the disease, regardless of exposure to $A$ or $B$. Their disease is caused by factors other than $A$ or $B$. Let their proportion in the population be $p_D$.\n- Type A: $(0, 1, 0, 1)$. These individuals get the disease if exposed to $A$ but not if exposed to $B$ alone. Let their proportion be $p_A$.\n- Type B: $(0, 0, 1, 1)$. These individuals get the disease if exposed to $B$ but not if exposed to $A$ alone. Let their proportion be $p_B$.\n- Type AB: $(0, 1, 1, 1)$. These individuals get the disease if exposed to $A$ or $B$. Let their proportion be $p_{AB}$.\n- Type S (Synergistic): $(0, 0, 0, 1)$. These individuals get the disease only if exposed to both $A$ and $B$. This type corresponds to individuals whose disease is caused by a sufficient cause that requires both $A$ and $B$ as component causes. Let their proportion be $p_S$.\n\nNow, we express the observed risks in terms of the proportions of these mutually exclusive population types.\nThe risk $R_{00}$ is the probability of disease when $A=0$ and $B=0$. Only Type D individuals get sick.\n$$R_{00} = P(Y_{00}=1) = p_D$$\nThe risk $R_{10}$ is the probability of disease when $A=1$ and $B=0$. Individuals of Type D, Type A, and Type AB get sick.\n$$R_{10} = P(Y_{10}=1) = p_D + p_A + p_{AB}$$\nThe risk $R_{01}$ is the probability of disease when $A=0$ and $B=1$. Individuals of Type D, Type B, and Type AB get sick.\n$$R_{01} = P(Y_{01}=1) = p_D + p_B + p_{AB}$$\nThe risk $R_{11}$ is the probability of disease when $A=1$ and $B=1$. Individuals of all types except Type I get sick.\n$$R_{11} = P(Y_{11}=1) = p_D + p_A + p_B + p_{AB} + p_S$$\n\nUsing the provided data: $R_{00} = 0.02$, $R_{10} = 0.06$, $R_{01} = 0.07$, and $R_{11} = 0.17$.\nWe can derive expressions for sums of proportions:\n1. $p_D = R_{00} = 0.02$\n2. $p_A + p_{AB} = R_{10} - p_D = R_{10} - R_{00} = 0.06 - 0.02 = 0.04$\n3. $p_B + p_{AB} = R_{01} - p_D = R_{01} - R_{00} = 0.07 - 0.02 = 0.05$\n\nNow we analyze $R_{11}$:\n$$R_{11} = (p_D + p_A + p_{AB}) + (p_B) + (p_S)$$\nSubstituting $R_{10}$ for the first term:\n$$R_{11} = R_{10} + p_B + p_S$$\nWe can also write:\n$$R_{11} = (p_D + p_B + p_{AB}) + (p_A) + (p_S)$$\nSubstituting $R_{01}$ for the first term:\n$$R_{11} = R_{01} + p_A + p_S$$\nA more useful relationship is found by substituting the component risk differences into the expression for $R_{11}$:\n$$R_{11} = p_D + (p_A+p_{AB}) + (p_B+p_{AB}) - p_{AB} + p_S$$\n$$R_{11} = R_{00} + (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00}) - p_{AB} + p_S$$\n$$R_{11} = R_{10} + R_{01} - R_{00} - p_{AB} + p_S$$\nRearranging this gives an expression for the difference between the synergistic and overlapping proportions:\n$$p_S - p_{AB} = R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$$\nThis expression, $R_{11} - R_{10} - R_{01} + R_{00}$, is known as the interaction term on the risk difference scale. Let's calculate its value:\n$$p_S - p_{AB} = 0.17 - 0.06 - 0.07 + 0.02 = 0.06$$\n\nThe problem asks for the lower bound on the fraction of disease cases among those with $A=1$ and $B=1$ that are due to the synergistic action of $A$ and $B$. This corresponds to the proportion of Type S individuals among all diseased individuals in this stratum. The fraction is $\\frac{p_S}{R_{11}}$. To find the lower bound of this fraction, we must find the minimum possible value of $p_S$.\n\nFrom the relation $p_S - p_{AB} = 0.06$, we have $p_S = 0.06 + p_{AB}$.\nTo minimize $p_S$, we must minimize $p_{AB}$.\nThe proportions $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_{AB}$ must all be non-negative.\nFrom equation (2): $p_A = 0.04 - p_{AB}$. The constraint $p_A \\ge 0$ implies $0.04 - p_{AB} \\ge 0$, so $p_{AB} \\le 0.04$.\nFrom equation (3): $p_B = 0.05 - p_{AB}$. The constraint $p_B \\ge 0$ implies $0.05 - p_{AB} \\ge 0$, so $p_{AB} \\le 0.05$.\nSince $p_{AB}$ must also be non-negative, we have the full constraints on $p_{AB}$:\n$$0 \\le p_{AB} \\le 0.04$$\nThe minimum value of $p_{AB}$ is $p_{AB, \\text{min}} = 0$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p_S$:\n$$p_{S, \\text{min}} = 0.06 + p_{AB, \\text{min}} = 0.06 + 0 = 0.06$$\nThis is the minimum proportion of the total population that must be of the synergistic type (Type S).\n\nThe question asks for the fraction of cases in the $A=1, B=1$ group. The total risk in this group is $R_{11} = 0.17$. The risk attributable to the synergistic mechanism is $p_S$. The fraction is $\\frac{p_S}{R_{11}}$.\nThe lower bound for this fraction is:\n$$ \\text{Lower Bound} = \\frac{p_{S, \\text{min}}}{R_{11}} = \\frac{0.06}{0.17} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{0.06}{0.17} = \\frac{6}{17} \\approx 0.352941176... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3529$.\nThis means that at least $35.29\\%$ of the disease cases in the population exposed to both $A$ and $B$ must be caused by a mechanism that requires both factors.",

We use Bayes' theorem for this, starting with the marginal probability of exposure $P(E=1)$.\n$$P(E=1) = P(E=1 \\mid C=1)P(C=1) + P(E=1 \\mid C=0)P(C=0)$$\n$$P(E=1) = \\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{2}{10}\\right) = \\frac{9}{20}$$\n$$P(E=0) = 1 - P(E=1) = 1 - \\frac{9}{20} = \\frac{11}{20}$$\nNow, we find the conditional probabilities of $C$ given $E$:\n$$P(C=1 \\mid E=1) = \\frac{P(E=1 \\mid C=1)P(C=1)}{P(E=1)} = \\frac{(\\frac{7}{10})(\\frac{1}{2})}{\\frac{9}{20}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{20}}{\\frac{9}{20}} = \\frac{7}{9}$$\n$$P(C=0 \\mid E=1) = 1 - P(C=1 \\mid E=1) = 1 - \\frac{7}{9} = \\frac{2}{9}$$\n$$P(C=1 \\mid E=0) = \\frac{P(E=0 \\mid C=1)P(C=1)}{P(E=0)} = \\frac{(1 - \\frac{7}{10})(\\frac{1}{2})}{\\frac{11}{20}} = \\frac{(\\frac{3}{10})(\\frac{1}{2})}{\\frac{11}{20}} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{20}}{\\frac{11}{20}} = \\frac{3}{11}$$\n$$P(C=0 \\mid E=0) = 1 - P(C=1 \\mid E=0) = 1 - \\frac{3}{11} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\nNow we compute the marginal risks:\n$$P(D=1 \\mid E=1) = R_{1,1}P(C=1 \\mid E=1) + R_{1,0}P(C=0 \\mid E=1)$$\n$$P(D=1 \\mid E=1) = \\left(\\frac{37}{100}\\right)\\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{69}{1000}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{9}\\right) = \\frac{259}{900} + \\frac{138}{9000} = \\frac{2590 + 138}{9000} = \\frac{2728}{9000}$$\n$$P(D=1 \\mid E=0) = R_{0,1}P(C=1 \\mid E=0) + R_{0,0}P(C=0 \\mid E=0)$$\n$$P(D=1 \\mid E=0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{11}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{11}\\right) = \\frac{3}{110} + \\frac{8}{550} = \\frac{15}{550} + \\frac{8}{550} = \\frac{23}{550}$$\nFinally, we compute the crude risk difference:\n$$RD_{crude} = P(D=1 \\mid E=1) - P(D=1 \\mid E=0) = \\frac{2728}{9000} - \\frac{23}{550}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $99000$.\n$$RD_{crude} = \\frac{2728 \\times 11}{99000} - \\frac{23 \\times 180}{99000} = \\frac{30008}{99000} - \\frac{4140}{99000} = \\frac{25868}{99000}$$\n\n### 4. Confounding Bias\nThe confounding bias is the crude risk difference minus the standardized risk difference.\n$$Bias = RD_{crude} - RD_{std} = \\frac{25868}{99000} - \\frac{319}{2000}$$\nThe least common denominator of $99000$ and $2000$ is $198000$.\n$$Bias = \\frac{25868 \\times 2}{198000} - \\frac{319 \\times 99}{198000} = \\frac{51736}{198000} - \\frac{31581}{198000} = \\frac{20155}{198000}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$Bias = \\frac{20155}{198000} \\approx 0.10179292...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $1$, $7$. The fifth digit is $9$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$Bias \\approx 0.1018$$",
