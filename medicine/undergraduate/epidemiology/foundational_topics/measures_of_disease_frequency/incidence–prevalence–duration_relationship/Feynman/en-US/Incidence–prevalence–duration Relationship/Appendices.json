This exercise takes you back to first principles, using a simple mass-balance model to derive both the familiar approximation and the more precise, exact steady-state formula. By working through this derivation and quantifying the approximation error for a given scenario, you will gain a much deeper appreciation for the assumptions that underpin this vital public health tool .",
