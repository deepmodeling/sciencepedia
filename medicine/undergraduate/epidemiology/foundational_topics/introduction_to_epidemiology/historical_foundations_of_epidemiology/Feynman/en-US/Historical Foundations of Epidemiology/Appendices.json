This practice invites you to step into Graunt's shoes, using historical data on baptisms and burials to estimate population size, a foundational act of demographic and public health surveillance. By deriving the estimator from first principles and then examining its bias under changing fertility rates, you will gain a deeper appreciation for the power and the inherent assumptions of early quantitative methods .",

            "problem": "John Graunt used annual tallies of baptisms and burials to infer the size of a city’s population, implicitly relying on properties of closed, approximately stationary populations. Consider a city in year $t_0$ that recorded $C_B = 7{,}950$ baptisms and $C_D = 7{,}880$ burials. An external demographic study, under conditions judged similar to the city, estimates life expectancy at birth as $e_0 = 32$ years.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate to closed populations, use only the following foundational elements:\n- The definitions of crude birth rate $b$ and crude death rate $d$ as per-capita annual rates of birth and death, respectively.\n- The characterization of a stationary population as one with constant size and age structure, satisfying $b = d$ and no migration.\n- The life table interpretation that the expected person-years lived per birth equals the life expectancy at birth $e_0$.\n- The demographic bookkeeping identity that for an age-structured, closed population with births $B(t)$ and survivorship function $l(a)$, the total population size at time $t$ is given by $N(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} B(t-a)\\,l(a)\\,da$.\n\nTask A (derivation under stationarity): Derive, from the elements above, a formula that estimates the total population size at $t_0$ using the annual count of baptisms and the life expectancy at birth. Clearly state the estimator in symbolic form (do not compute a number). Explain why the availability of $C_D$ offers a plausibility check for the stationarity assumption at $t_0$.\n\nTask B (bias under varying fertility): Now suppose the city is not stationary because fertility has been changing smoothly so that annual births follow an exponential trend $B(t) = B_0 \\exp(rt)$ with constant proportional growth rate $r$ (per year), while mortality is memoryless with constant hazard $\\lambda$, so that $l(a) = \\exp(-\\lambda a)$ and $e_0 = 1/\\lambda$ remains constant. If one nevertheless applies the Graunt-style estimator from Task A to the current baptisms $B(t)$, derive the multiplicative relative bias of this estimator with respect to the true $N(t)$, defined as\n$$\\text{RelativeBias}(t) \\equiv \\frac{\\widehat{N}(t)}{N(t)} - 1.$$\nThen evaluate this relative bias for $r = 0.01$ per year and $e_0 = 32$ years. Express the final result for the relative bias as a decimal (unitless), and round your answer to $4$ significant figures. Your final reported answer must be this single rounded number.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed internally consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All data and definitions required for a complete solution are provided.\n\n**Task A: Derivation under stationarity**\n\nThe derivation begins from the foundational demographic bookkeeping identity for the total population size $N(t)$ in a closed population:\n$$N(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} B(t-a)\\,l(a)\\,da$$\nwhere $B(t-a)$ is the number of births at time $t-a$ (i.e., $a$ years ago) and $l(a)$ is the survivorship function, representing the probability of surviving from birth to age $a$.\n\nThe problem requires us to assume the population is stationary. A key characteristic of a stationary population is that the number of births per year is constant over time. We denote this constant number of births as $B$. Therefore, for any time $t$ and age $a$, we have $B(t-a) = B$.\n\nSubstituting this into the population identity gives:\n$$N = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} B\\,l(a)\\,da$$\nSince $B$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$N = B \\int_{0}^{\\infty} l(a)\\,da$$\nThe problem provides the life table interpretation that \"the expected person-years lived per birth equals the life expectancy at birth $e_0$.\" The total person-years lived by a cohort of $B$ births is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} B \\cdot l(a)\\,da$. Therefore, the person-years lived per birth is $\\frac{1}{B}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} B \\cdot l(a)\\,da = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} l(a)\\,da$. This quantity is, by definition, the life expectancy at birth, $e_0$.\n$$e_0 = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} l(a)\\,da$$\nSubstituting this result back into the equation for the population size $N$ yields:\n$$N = B \\cdot e_0$$\nThis equation states that in a stationary population, the total population size is the product of the constant annual number of births and the life expectancy at birth.\n\nTo form an estimator for the population at time $t_0$, we use the observed data. The annual count of baptisms $C_B$ is used as the measure for the annual number of births. Thus, we set $B = C_B$. The resulting estimator, which we can denote as $\\widehat{N}(t_0)$, is:\n$$\\widehat{N}(t_0) = C_B \\cdot e_0$$\n\nThe availability of the annual burials count, $C_D$, provides a plausibility check for the crucial assumption of stationarity. In a stationary population, not only are the age structure and total size constant, but the crude birth rate $b$ must equal the crude death rate $d$. The definitions are $b = B/N$ and $d = D/N$, where $D$ is the total annual number of deaths. The condition $b=d$ thus implies $B/N = D/N$, which simplifies to $B=D$. This means a stationary population must have an equal number of births and deaths each year.\n\nAt time $t_0$, the problem provides the observed data $C_B = 7{,}950$ baptisms and $C_D = 7{,}880$ burials. These values are very close to each other, with a relative difference of approximately $(7950-7880)/7950 \\approx 0.9\\%$. Since the data shows $C_B \\approx C_D$, it is consistent with the necessary condition $B=D$ for a stationary population. If $C_B$ and $C_D$ were substantially different, the stationarity assumption would be immediately undermined.\n\n**Task B: Bias under varying fertility**\n\nWe now consider a non-stationary scenario where annual births follow an exponential trend, $B(t) = B_0 \\exp(rt)$, and mortality is memoryless with a constant hazard $\\lambda$, such that the survivorship function is $l(a) = \\exp(-\\lambda a)$. The life expectancy for this mortality model is $e_0 = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\lambda a) \\, da = 1/\\lambda$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the true population size, $N(t)$, using the bookkeeping identity:\n$$N(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} B(t-a)\\,l(a)\\,da$$\nSubstituting the given forms for $B(t)$ and $l(a)$:\n$$N(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} [B_0 \\exp(r(t-a))] \\cdot [\\exp(-\\lambda a)]\\,da$$\nWe can factor out terms not dependent on the integration variable $a$:\n$$N(t) = B_0 \\exp(rt) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ra) \\exp(-\\lambda a)\\,da$$\nRecognizing that $B(t) = B_0 \\exp(rt)$, we have:\n$$N(t) = B(t) \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(r+\\lambda)a)\\,da$$\nThe integral is a standard exponential integral. Assuming $r+\\lambda > 0$, which is true for a growing ($r>0$) population with positive life expectancy ($\\lambda>0$):\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-(r+\\lambda)a)\\,da = \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(r+\\lambda)a)}{-(r+\\lambda)} \\right]_{a=0}^{\\infty} = 0 - \\frac{1}{-(r+\\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{r+\\lambda}$$\nThus, the true population size is:\n$$N(t) = \\frac{B(t)}{r+\\lambda}$$\n\nNext, we define the Graunt-style estimator from Task A, applied at time $t$. This estimator, $\\widehat{N}(t)$, uses the current number of births $B(t)$ and the life expectancy $e_0$:\n$$\\widehat{N}(t) = B(t) \\cdot e_0$$\n\nThe multiplicative relative bias is defined as $\\text{RelativeBias}(t) = \\frac{\\widehat{N}(t)}{N(t)} - 1$. Substituting our expressions for $\\widehat{N}(t)$ and $N(t)$:\n$$\\text{RelativeBias}(t) = \\frac{B(t) \\cdot e_0}{\\frac{B(t)}{r+\\lambda}} - 1$$\nThe $B(t)$ term cancels, showing the bias is constant over time:\n$$\\text{RelativeBias} = e_0(r+\\lambda) - 1$$\nNow, we use the relationship $e_0 = 1/\\lambda$, which implies $\\lambda = 1/e_0$.\n$$\\text{RelativeBias} = e_0\\left(r + \\frac{1}{e_0}\\right) - 1 = r e_0 + e_0\\left(\\frac{1}{e_0}\\right) - 1 = r e_0 + 1 - 1$$\nThe symbolic expression for the relative bias simplifies to:\n$$\\text{RelativeBias} = r \\cdot e_0$$\nThis result shows that in an exponentially growing population, the Graunt-style estimator has a positive bias directly proportional to both the population growth rate $r$ and the life expectancy $e_0$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this bias for the given values: $r = 0.01$ per year and $e_0 = 32$ years.\n$$\\text{RelativeBias} = (0.01) \\cdot (32) = 0.32$$\nThe problem requires the answer rounded to $4$ significant figures. Expressing $0.32$ with four significant figures gives $0.3200$.",
