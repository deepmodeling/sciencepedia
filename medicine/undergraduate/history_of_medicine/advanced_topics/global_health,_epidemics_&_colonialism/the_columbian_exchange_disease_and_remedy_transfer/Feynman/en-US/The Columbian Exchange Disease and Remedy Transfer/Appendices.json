This exercise demystifies this crucial parameter by building it from the ground up using the classic Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. By connecting $R_0$ to tangible factors like contact rates and infectious duration, you will gain an intuitive understanding of the mechanics that governed the spread of diseases like smallpox in previously unexposed populations.

The basic reproduction number, by definition, is the expected number of new infections generated by one typical infectious individual introduced into a fully susceptible population.\n\nNear the disease-free state (early invasion), the susceptible population satisfies $S(t)\\approx N$, so $\\frac{S(t)}{N}\\approx 1$.

            "problem": "During the early phases of the Columbian Exchange, Old World pathogens such as smallpox and measles entered populations in the Americas that had no prior exposure, a condition often termed virgin soil. Consider the standard epidemiological definitions: the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is the expected number of secondary infections produced by one typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population, and the herd immunity threshold $H$ is the minimal immune fraction in the population that prevents sustained transmission. Assume homogeneous mixing and sterilizing immunity upon infection or vaccination so that immunity removes individuals from the susceptible pool without affecting transmission among the remaining susceptibles.\n\nStarting from these definitions, derive the minimal immune fraction $H$ required to prevent sustained transmission as a function of $R_0$. Then, using historically plausible values, take smallpox to have $R_0$ in the interval $[3,6]$ and measles in the interval $[12,18]$. Evaluate $H$ at the endpoints of each interval.

Finally, briefly interpret the meaning of these thresholds for virgin soil populations in the context of the Columbian Exchange, based only on the definitions and assumptions stated.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the herd immunity threshold $H$ as a function of the basic reproduction number $R_0$, followed by a calculation of $H$ for specified values of $R_0$ corresponding to smallpox and measles, and an interpretation of the results in a historical context.\n\n**Derivation of $H$ as a function of $R_0$**\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, represents the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population.\n\nLet $s$ be the fraction of the population that is susceptible. In a population where a fraction of individuals are immune, not all contacts of an infectious person will be with a susceptible person. Due to the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the probability that a contact is with a susceptible individual is simply $s$.\n\nThe effective reproduction number, $R_e$, is the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious individual in a population with some level of immunity. It is given by the product of the basic reproduction number and the fraction of the population that is susceptible:\n$$R_e = R_0 \\cdot s$$\n\nSustained transmission of a disease occurs if, on average, each infected individual infects at least one other person, i.e., if $R_e \\ge 1$. To prevent sustained transmission, the number of secondary infections must be, on average, less than one. The critical threshold for preventing an epidemic from growing is when each infected person produces exactly one new infection. This condition is $R_e = 1$.\n$$R_0 \\cdot s_{crit} = 1$$\nHere, $s_{crit}$ is the critical fraction of susceptible individuals in the population below which sustained transmission does not occur. Solving for $s_{crit}$ gives:\n$$s_{crit} = \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\nThe population is composed of susceptible and immune individuals. Let $H$ be the fraction of the population that is immune. Assuming no other population states, the sum of the susceptible and immune fractions must be unity:\n$$s + H = 1$$\nThe herd immunity threshold, $H$, is defined as the minimal immune fraction required to prevent sustained transmission. This corresponds to the immune fraction when the susceptible fraction is at its critical value, $s_{crit}$.\n$$H = 1 - s_{crit}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s_{crit}$ yields the relationship between the herd immunity threshold and the basic reproduction number:\n$$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\n**Calculation of $H$ for Smallpox and Measles**\n\nUsing the derived formula, we can now calculate the herd immunity thresholds for the given $R_0$ values.\n\n1.  **Smallpox at $R_0 = 3$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.6667$.\n\n2.  **Smallpox at $R_0 = 6$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.833333...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.8333$.\n\n3.  **Measles at $R_0 = 12$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\approx 0.916666...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.9167$.\n\n4.  **Measles at $R_0 = 18$**:\n    $$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{18} = \\frac{17}{18} \\approx 0.944444...$$\n    Rounded to four significant figures, $H = 0.9444$.\n\n**Interpretation for Virgin Soil Populations**\n\nA \"virgin soil\" population is one with no pre-existing immunity to a given pathogen. In such a population, the initial immune fraction is $H = 0$, and the susceptible fraction is $s = 1$. When a pathogen like smallpox or measles is introduced, the epidemic will spread rapidly because $R_e = R_0 \\cdot s = R_0 \\cdot 1 = R_0$, which is much greater than $1$.\n\nThe calculated herd immunity thresholds ($H$) represent the proportion of the population that must become immune for the epidemic to cease its sustained spread. In the historical context of the Columbian Exchange, before the advent of vaccination, immunity could only be acquired through infection and subsequent recovery. Therefore, the high herd immunity thresholds calculated—ranging from $66.67\\%$ to $83.33\\%$ for smallpox and from $91.67\\%$ to $94.44\\%$ for measles—quantify the immense scale of the outbreak required for the disease to \"burn out\" in a non-immune population. These figures imply that a catastrophic proportion of the population would have to contract the disease to reach the threshold where transmission naturally declines. This mathematical relationship explains why the introduction of these highly transmissible pathogens to the immunologically naive populations of the Americas resulted in devastating demographic collapse.",

            "problem": "In the early phase of the Columbian Exchange, smallpox moved from Afro-Eurasia to the Americas, with substantial mortality in coastal settlements that were first exposed to transoceanic traffic. Consider a coastal settlement in $1721$ with total population size $N$. During a smallpox outbreak, let the attack rate be defined as the probability $A$ that a randomly selected individual becomes infected over the course of the outbreak, and let the case fatality ratio (CFR) be defined as the conditional probability $f$ that an infected individual dies of smallpox. Both $A$ and $f$ are widely used epidemiological quantities.\n\nA historically documented remedy transfer, smallpox variolation, was adopted by a fraction of the settlement as the outbreak unfolded. Variolation involved deliberate infection with material from smallpox pustules to induce a milder course, which historically reduced the probability of death given infection but did not avoid infection itself. Assume the following for this settlement:\n- Total population size $N = 8{,}750$ persons.\n- Fraction of the population receiving variolation $p = 0.20$.\n- For those who did not receive variolation, the outbreak attack rate was $A_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.64$ and the case fatality ratio for naturally acquired smallpox was $f_{\\mathrm{n}} = 0.28$.\n- For those who received variolation, treat infection as certain due to the procedure, so the attack rate is $A_{\\mathrm{v}} = 1$, and the case fatality ratio under variolation was $f_{\\mathrm{v}} = 0.015$.\n\nAssume that, for each individual, the event of infection and the subsequent outcome are governed by the multiplication rule of probability, with death occurring with probability $f$ conditional on infection.

The total population can be partitioned into two mutually exclusive groups: those who received variolation and those who did not. By the linearity of expectation, the total expected number of deaths is the sum of the expected number of deaths in each group.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of people in each subgroup based on the total population $N = 8,750$ and the fraction variolated $p = 0.20$.\n-   **Un-variolated population ($N_{\\mathrm{u}}$):** This is the fraction of the population that did not receive variolation, which is $1 - p = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{u}} = 0.80 \\times 8,750 = 7,000 \\text{ persons}$$\n-   **Variolated population ($N_{\\mathrm{v}}$):** This is the fraction that did receive it.\n    $$N_{\\mathrm{v}} = 0.20 \\times 8,750 = 1,750 \\text{ persons}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of death for an individual in each group. According to the problem, the probability of dying is the attack rate (probability of infection) multiplied by the case fatality ratio (probability of death given infection).\n-   **For an un-variolated individual:** The probability of death ($P_{\\text{death, u}}$) is the product of the attack rate for the un-variolated, $A_{\\mathrm{u}}=0.64$, and the case fatality ratio for natural infection, $f_{\\mathrm{n}}=0.28$.\n    $$P_{\\text{death, u}} = A_{\\mathrm{u}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{n}} = 0.64 \\times 0.28 = 0.1792$$\n-   **For a variolated individual:** The probability of death ($P_{\\text{death, v}}$) is the product of the attack rate for the variolated, $A_{\\mathrm{v}}=1$, and the case fatality ratio for variolation, $f_{\\mathrm{v}}=0.015$.\n    $$P_{\\text{death, v}} = A_{\\mathrm{v}} \\times f_{\\mathrm{v}} = 1 \\times 0.015 = 0.015$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the expected number of deaths in each subgroup.
