            "problem": "A city in the United States (U.S.) experienced entrenched residential segregation during the early to mid twentieth century as a result of discriminatory mortgage lending practices commonly referred to as redlining. Historical public health records indicate marked disparities in pediatric asthma outcomes linked to neighborhood-level access to preventive care and environmental exposures (for example, traffic-related air pollution and older housing stock with persistent indoor allergens). Consider a one-year community study that sampled two neighborhood groups:\n\n- Group 1: Residents of historically redlined neighborhoods that received fewer investments in clinical infrastructure.\n- Group 2: Residents of non-redlined neighborhoods with comparatively greater access to primary care and environmental remediation.\n\nThe study’s $2\\times2$ table, for a one-year observation of pediatric asthma hospitalizations (defined as at least one hospitalization during the year), reports the following counts:\n- Cases in Group $1$: $a=24$\n- Non-cases in Group $1$: $b=76$\n- Cases in Group $2$: $c=12$\n- Non-cases in Group $2$: $d=88$\n\nStarting from core epidemiologic definitions appropriate to this historical health context:\n- The one-year risk in any group equals the number of cases in that group divided by the total number of individuals observed in that group over the year.\n- The relative risk between two groups equals the ratio of those risks.\n- The risk difference equals the difference of those risks.\n\nUse these definitions to derive expressions for the one-year risk in each group, the relative risk, and the risk difference, and then compute their values for the data above. Finally, report the single numeric quantity $RR-RD$ as a dimensionless decimal. If you carry out any decimal computations, do not round; provide the exact decimal value. Explain, in your derivation, how each measure (relative risk versus risk difference) supports interpretation of structural inequities in this historical setting, but report only the requested numeric quantity $RR-RD$ as your final output.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of several epidemiologic measures of association and impact based on provided count data from a one-year community study on pediatric asthma hospitalizations. The study compares a group from historically redlined neighborhoods (Group $1$) with a group from non-redlined neighborhoods (Group $2$).\n\nFirst, we formalize the given quantities. Let $a$ be the number of cases (hospitalized children) and $b$ be the number of non-cases in Group $1$. Let $c$ be the number of cases and $d$ be the number of non-cases in Group $2$.\nThe given data are:\n- $a = 24$\n- $b = 76$\n- $c = 12$\n- $d = 88$\n\nThe total number of individuals observed in each group are:\n- Total in Group $1$: $N_1 = a + b = 24 + 76 = 100$\n- Total in Group $2$: $N_2 = c + d = 12 + 88 = 100$\n\nThe problem defines the one-year risk in a group as the number of cases divided by the total number of individuals in that group. We denote the risk in Group $1$ as $R_1$ and in Group $2$ as $R_2$.\n\nThe expression for the risk in Group $1$ is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{a}{a+b}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{24}{24+76} = \\frac{24}{100} = 0.24$$\n\nThe expression for the risk in Group $2$ is:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{c}{c+d}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{12}{12+88} = \\frac{12}{100} = 0.12$$\n\nNext, we address the measures of association. The problem defines relative risk ($RR$) as the ratio of the risks.\nThe expression for the relative risk is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_1}{R_2} = \\frac{a / (a+b)}{c / (c+d)}$$\nUsing the computed risk values:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.24}{0.12} = 2$$\n\nThe problem defines risk difference ($RD$) as the difference between the risks.\nThe expression for the risk difference is:\n$$RD = R_1 - R_2 = \\frac{a}{a+b} - \\frac{c}{c+d}$$\nUsing the computed risk values:\n$$RD = 0.24 - 0.12 = 0.12$$\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of how each measure supports the interpretation of structural inequities. The relative risk ($RR$) is a measure of the strength of association. An $RR$ of $2$ indicates that children in the historically redlined neighborhoods had twice the risk of being hospitalized for asthma compared to children in non-redlined neighborhoods. This metric highlights the magnitude of the disparity in relative terms.\n\nThe risk difference ($RD$), also known as attributable risk, is an absolute measure of impact. An $RD$ of $0.12$ signifies an excess risk of $12$ hospitalizations per $100$ children in Group $1$ attributable to the conditions differentiating it from Group $2$. This metric quantifies the absolute burden of disease on the community and illustrates the concrete public health consequences of discriminatory practices.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the computation of the single numeric quantity $RR - RD$.\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$RR - RD = 2 - 0.12 = 1.88$$\nThis quantity is dimensionless, as requested. The calculation is exact and requires no rounding.",

This practice demonstrates the critical method of direct age standardization, a cornerstone of public health research.

            "problem": "A mid-twentieth-century public health archive from the United States (U.S.) records age-specific all-cause mortality rates for two racialized populations, labeled Group B and Group W, during a one-year interval. Because structural inequities shaped different age distributions across these groups, crude mortality rates are not directly comparable. To ensure a fair comparison grounded in the history of medicine and epidemiologic practice, use direct age standardization with the following historically plausible data.\n\nAge-specific mortality rates (deaths per $100{,}000$ person-years):\n- Ages $0$–$14$: Group B $85$, Group W $60$.\n- Ages $15$–$44$: Group B $155$, Group W $130$.\n- Ages $45$–$64$: Group B $780$, Group W $720$.\n- Ages $\\geq 65$: Group B $5200$, Group W $4800$.\n\nStandard population counts for a large city (one-year observation window; treat counts as person-years):\n- Ages $0$–$14$: $300{,}000$.\n- Ages $15$–$44$: $500{,}000$.\n- Ages $45$–$64$: $250{,}000$.\n- Ages $\\geq 65$: $150{,}000$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "Direct age standardization is a method used to compare mortality rates between populations with different age structures. It is necessary here because structural inequities can lead to different age distributions in Group B and Group W. For instance, if one group is significantly younger on average, its crude (overall) mortality rate might appear deceptively low, as mortality risk is strongly dependent on age. By applying the age-specific death rates from each group to a single, common standard population, we can calculate age-standardized rates. These hypothetical rates show what the mortality would be if both groups had the same age structure, thus allowing for a fair comparison of their underlying mortality risks.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\nFirst, we determine the total size of the standard population:\n$$ P_S = 300{,}000 + 500{,}000 + 250{,}000 + 150{,}000 = 1{,}200{,}000 \\text{ person-years} $$\nNext, for each group, we calculate the number of deaths that would be expected if its age-specific mortality rates occurred in the standard population.

            "problem": "Cortisol secretion follows a diurnal rhythm governed by the Hypothalamic–Pituitary–Adrenal (HPA) axis, with higher levels upon waking and a decline across the day. In the history of medicine, the weathering hypothesis, articulated by Arline Geronimus, posits that chronic exposure to structural racism and inequities accumulates physiological stress, potentially dysregulating systems such as the HPA axis. One quantitative way to compare diurnal profiles is to compute the area under the cortisol–time curve (AUC) across waking to bedtime. Consider two groups of advanced-undergraduate research participants sampled at identical time points after waking: a group experiencing high chronic exposures to structural racism (Group S) and a group with comparatively lower chronic exposures (Group L). Assume cortisol varies linearly between sampled times. The sampled times (in hours since waking) are $t_0=0$, $t_1=0.5$, $t_2=5$, $t_3=11$, and $t_4=15.5$. Salivary cortisol concentrations are measured in nanomoles per liter (nmol/L).

Comparing the data, Group S shows a lower morning peak ($14$ vs. $20$ for Group L) and remains more elevated at the end of the day ($5$ vs. $2$ for Group L). This flatter profile in Group S results in a higher total cortisol exposure over the day, as reflected by its larger AUC ($132.8$ vs. $115.3$). Therefore, Group S exhibits the profile consistent with dysregulation. The final answer requires the two AUC values.",
