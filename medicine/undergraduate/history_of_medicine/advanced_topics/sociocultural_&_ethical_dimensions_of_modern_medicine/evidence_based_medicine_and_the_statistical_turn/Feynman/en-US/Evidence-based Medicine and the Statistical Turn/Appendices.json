            "problem": "In the mid-twentieth century, the rise of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) relied increasingly on formal statistical reasoning to adjudicate the effects of therapies in realistic clinical populations. Consider an observational cohort study from a pre-randomization era investigating a new therapy for an infectious disease. Patients are grouped by baseline severity into $2$ strata: \"mild\" and \"severe.\" Outcomes are measured as survival at $30$ days. The observed counts are as follows:\n\n- Mild stratum:\n  - Treated: $19$ survivors out of $20$ patients.\n  - Untreated: $180$ survivors out of $200$ patients.\n- Severe stratum:\n  - Treated: $2$ survivors out of $20$ patients.\n  - Untreated: $1$ survivor out of $20$ patients.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions of risk and contrast measures, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Define the risk (probability of survival) in each group within each stratum as the ratio of survivors to total patients, and define the risk difference as $RD = r_{\\text{treated}} - r_{\\text{untreated}}$. Compute the stratum-specific risks and risk differences, and determine whether the treatment is beneficial within each stratum.\n\n2. Compute the pooled overall risks for the treated and untreated groups by aggregating across both strata, and then compute the pooled overall risk difference ignoring stratification.\n\n3. Define the \"Simpson reversal magnitude\" for this dataset as the absolute difference between the pooled overall risk difference and the simple average of the two stratum-specific risk differences. Compute this magnitude.\n\n4. In a short argument within your solution, articulate the causal conditions that can generate a reversal in sign between stratum-specific and pooled contrasts in observational data, grounding your explanation in the historical motivations for the statistical turn in EBM. You may invoke core definitions from probability and causal reasoning (e.g., confounding by indication) but do not assume randomized assignment.\n\nExpress the final numerical result for the Simpson reversal magnitude in decimal form and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not include units in the final result.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in elementary probability, statistics, and causal reasoning, presenting a classic case of Simpson's paradox. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All data and definitions required for the solution are provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a four-part analysis of observational data from a hypothetical clinical study. We will address each part in sequence, using the provided definitions.\n\nLet $S=1$ denote survival and $S=0$ denote non-survival. Let $T=1$ for treated patients and $T=0$ for untreated patients. Let $Z=\\text{mild}$ for the mild stratum and $Z=\\text{severe}$ for the severe stratum. The risk of survival is the conditional probability $P(S=1 | T=t, Z=z)$ for a given treatment status $t$ and stratum $z$.\n\n**Part 1: Stratum-Specific Risks and Risk Differences**\n\nFirst, we analyze the \"mild\" stratum ($Z=\\text{mild}$).\nThe number of treated patients is $n_{T, \\text{mild}} = 20$, with $19$ survivors.\nThe number of untreated patients is $n_{UT, \\text{mild}} = 200$, with $180$ survivors.\n\nThe risk for the treated group in the mild stratum is:\n$$r_{T, \\text{mild}} = P(S=1 | T=1, Z=\\text{mild}) = \\frac{19}{20} = 0.95$$\nThe risk for the untreated group in the mild stratum is:\n$$r_{UT, \\text{mild}} = P(S=1 | T=0, Z=\\text{mild}) = \\frac{180}{200} = 0.90$$\nThe stratum-specific risk difference for the mild stratum, $RD_{\\text{mild}}$, is:\n$$RD_{\\text{mild}} = r_{T, \\text{mild}} - r_{UT, \\text{mild}} = 0.95 - 0.90 = 0.05$$\nSince $RD_{\\text{mild}} > 0$, the treatment appears beneficial within the mild stratum.\n\nNext, we analyze the \"severe\" stratum ($Z=\\text{severe}$).\nThe number of treated patients is $n_{T, \\text{severe}} = 20$, with $2$ survivors.\nThe number of untreated patients is $n_{UT, \\text{severe}} = 20$, with $1$ survivor.\n\nThe risk for the treated group in the severe stratum is:\n$$r_{T, \\text{severe}} = P(S=1 | T=1, Z=\\text{severe}) = \\frac{2}{20} = 0.10$$\nThe risk for the untreated group in the severe stratum is:\n$$r_{UT, \\text{severe}} = P(S=1 | T=0, Z=\\text{severe}) = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05$$\nThe stratum-specific risk difference for the severe stratum, $RD_{\\text{severe}}$, is:\n$$RD_{\\text{severe}} = r_{T, \\text{severe}} - r_{UT, \\text{severe}} = 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05$$\nSince $RD_{\\text{severe}} > 0$, the treatment also appears beneficial within the severe stratum. In both strata, the treatment is associated with a 5 percentage point increase in survival probability.\n\n**Part 2: Pooled Overall Risks and Risk Difference**\n\nTo compute the pooled (overall) risks, we aggregate the data across both strata, ignoring the severity variable.\n\nTotal number of treated patients:\n$$N_T = n_{T, \\text{mild}} + n_{T, \\text{severe}} = 20 + 20 = 40$$\nTotal number of survivors among treated patients:\n$$S_T = 19 + 2 = 21$$\nTotal number of untreated patients:\n$$N_{UT} = n_{UT, \\text{mild}} + n_{UT, \\text{severe}} = 200 + 20 = 220$$\nTotal number of survivors among untreated patients:\n$$S_{UT} = 180 + 1 = 181$$\n\nThe pooled risk for the treated group is:\n$$r_{T, \\text{pooled}} = \\frac{S_T}{N_T} = \\frac{21}{40} = 0.525$$\nThe pooled risk for the untreated group is:\n$$r_{UT, \\text{pooled}} = \\frac{S_{UT}}{N_{UT}} = \\frac{181}{220}$$\nThe pooled overall risk difference, $RD_{\\text{pooled}}$, is:\n$$RD_{\\text{pooled}} = r_{T, \\text{pooled}} - r_{UT, \\text{pooled}} = \\frac{21}{40} - \\frac{181}{220}$$\nTo subtract these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $440$.\n$$RD_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{21 \\times 11}{40 \\times 11} - \\frac{181 \\times 2}{220 \\times 2} = \\frac{231}{440} - \\frac{362}{440} = \\frac{231 - 362}{440} = -\\frac{131}{440}$$\nIn decimal form, this is approximately $-0.2977$. Here, the sign is reversed: the pooled analysis suggests the treatment is harmful. This is a classic demonstration of Simpson's Paradox.\n\n**Part 3: Simpson Reversal Magnitude**\n\nThe problem defines the Simpson reversal magnitude, $M$, as the absolute difference between the pooled overall risk difference and the simple average of the two stratum-specific risk differences.\nFirst, we find the average of the stratum-specific risk differences:\n$$\\text{Average}(RD_{\\text{stratum}}) = \\frac{RD_{\\text{mild}} + RD_{\\text{severe}}}{2} = \\frac{0.05 + 0.05}{2} = 0.05$$\nNow, we compute the magnitude $M$:\n$$M = |RD_{\\text{pooled}} - \\text{Average}(RD_{\\text{stratum}})| = \\left|-\\frac{131}{440} - 0.05\\right|$$\nConverting $0.05$ to a fraction, $0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n$$M = \\left|-\\frac{131}{440} - \\frac{1}{20}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{131}{440} - \\frac{22}{440}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{131 + 22}{440}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{153}{440}\\right|$$\n$$M = \\frac{153}{440} \\approx 0.34772727...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the Simpson reversal magnitude is $0.3477$.\n\n**Part 4: Causal Conditions for a Reversal (Simpson's Paradox)**\n\nA reversal in sign between stratum-specific and pooled contrasts, known as Simpson's Paradox, arises in observational data due to **confounding**. A confounder is a third variable that is associated with both the exposure (treatment) and the outcome (survival), creating a spurious association between them. In this dataset, the **baseline severity** of the disease is the confounder.\n\nFor a variable $Z$ (severity) to be a confounder of the effect of $X$ (treatment) on $Y$ (survival), two conditions must be met in the data:\n1.  $Z$ must be associated with the exposure $X$. In this study, we must check if the proportion of treated patients differs between severity strata.\n    -   Proportion of patients treated in the mild stratum: $\\frac{20}{20+200} = \\frac{20}{220} \\approx 0.091$ or $9.1\\%$.\n    -   Proportion of patients treated in the severe stratum: $\\frac{20}{20+20} = \\frac{20}{40} = 0.50$ or $50\\%$.\n    There is a strong association: severe patients are far more likely to receive the treatment. This is often termed \"confounding by indication,\" where the clinical reason for giving a treatment (severe illness) is itself a strong predictor of the outcome.\n2.  $Z$ must be a cause of the outcome $Y$, independent of the exposure $X$. We check if severity is associated with survival, for instance, in the untreated group.\n    -   Survival risk in untreated mild patients: $r_{UT, \\text{mild}} = 0.90$.\n    -   Survival risk in untreated severe patients: $r_{UT, \\text{severe}} = 0.05$.\n    The association is extremely strong: severely ill patients have a much lower intrinsic probability of survival.\n\nThe paradox arises because the pooled analysis \"crude\" comparison is not a fair one. The pooled \"treated\" group is composed of $50\\%$ severe patients ($20/40$) and $50\\%$ mild patients ($20/40$). The pooled \"untreated\" group is overwhelmingly composed of mild patients ($200/220 \\approx 91\\%$) and only a few severe patients ($20/220 \\approx 9\\%$). Therefore, the pooled analysis is effectively comparing a high-risk group (the treated) to a low-risk group (the untreated). The apparent harmful effect of the treatment in the pooled data is not due to the treatment itself but is caused by the fact that the treatment was preferentially given to sicker patients who were destined for poor outcomes regardless.\n\nThe historical motivation for the \"statistical turn\" in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) was precisely to address such failures of naive observational analysis. The realization that confounding by indication could lead to completely wrong conclusions (e.g., a beneficial drug appearing harmful) drove the development and adoption of the **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT)**. In an RCT, treatment is assigned randomly. This procedure, by its very design, breaks the association between the confounder ($Z$) and the exposure ($X$), ensuring that, on average, the treated and untreated groups have the same distribution of patient severities. This allows for an unbiased estimation of the causal effect of the treatment. The paradox in this problem illustrates why stratifying on confounders or, more robustly, randomizing treatment became a cornerstone of modern clinical evidence.",

This practice explores the foundational logic of how randomization allows us to make valid causal claims about a treatment's average effect on a population.

            "problem": "In the historical shift toward Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM), randomized comparative trials became central because randomization made causal claims about populations defensible without relying on mechanistic certainties. Consider an ethically and scientifically sound, parallel-group Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing a novel therapy to usual care for a dichotomous clinical outcome, where each participant is conceptualized within the potential outcomes framework as having two well-defined potential outcomes: $Y(1)$ under treatment and $Y(0)$ under control. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is defined as the population quantity $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0)]$. Assume the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), consistency, positivity, and that treatment assignment is randomized, so that assignment is independent of the potential outcomes. In this study, the observed sample mean outcomes in the two randomized arms are $\\bar{Y}_{1}=0.72$ for the treated arm and $\\bar{Y}_{0}=0.60$ for the control arm, where $\\bar{Y}_{t}$ denotes the empirical mean of the observed $Y$ among participants assigned treatment status $t \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

Express the final value of the ATE as a decimal, without a percentage sign. No rounding is required beyond what is implied by the given values.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of causal inference and statistics, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\nThe problem asks for two components: first, the computation of the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) from the provided sample data, and second, an explanation of the epistemic justification for this procedure within the context of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM).\n\nFirst, we compute the numerical value of the ATE. The ATE is defined as the population average of the difference between the potential outcome under treatment, $Y(1)$, and the potential outcome under control, $Y(0)$.\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]\n$$\nBy the linearity of the expectation operator, this can be written as:\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)] - \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]\n$$\nThis expression involves population averages of potential outcomes, which are not directly observed. The crucial step is to connect these quantities to the observable data from the Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Let $T$ represent the treatment assignment, where $T=1$ for the therapy group and $T=0$ for the usual care (control) group. The problem states that the assignment is randomized. This formally means that the treatment assignment $T$ is statistically independent of the potential outcomes $(Y(1), Y(0))$. This is written as:\n$$\n(Y(1), Y(0)) \\perp T\n$$\nThis independence assumption implies that the expected potential outcome under treatment is the same for the entire population as it is for the sub-population that actually received the treatment. Mathematically:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | T=1]\n$$\nSimilarly, for the control condition:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y(0)] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | T=0]\n$$\nThe problem also states the consistency assumption (part of SUTVA), which links potential outcomes to observed outcomes. For an individual who received treatment ($T=1$), their observed outcome $Y$ is $Y(1)$. For an individual who received control ($T=0$), their observed outcome $Y$ is $Y(0)$. This can be formally stated as $Y = Y(T)$.\n\nTherefore, the expected *observed* outcome in the treated group is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y | T=1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1) | T=1]\n$$\nCombining this with the randomization assumption, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y | T=1] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(1)]\n$$\nAnd similarly for the control group:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y | T=0] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0) | T=0] = \\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]\n$$\nWe have now shown that the unobservable population expectations of potential outcomes, $\\mathbb{E}[Y(1)]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y(0)]$, are equal to the observable population expectations of outcomes conditional on treatment assignment, $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T=1]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[Y | T=0]$, respectively. This equality is known as *identifiability*.\n\nSubstituting these identified quantities back into the definition of the ATE:\n$$\n\\text{ATE} = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T=1] - \\mathbb{E}[Y | T=0]\n$$\nThe problem provides the sample means from the two randomized arms, $\\bar{Y}_{1} = 0.72$ and $\\bar{Y}_{0} = 0.60$. These sample means are unbiased estimators for the respective population conditional expectations:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Y}_{1}] = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T=1] \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{Y}_{0}] = \\mathbb{E}[Y | T=0]\n$$\nTherefore, an unbiased estimator for the ATE, denoted $\\widehat{\\text{ATE}}$, is the simple difference in sample means:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{ATE}} = \\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0}\n$$\nThe value of the ATE implied by the data is this point estimate. Substituting the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{ATE}} = 0.72 - 0.60 = 0.12\n$$\n\nSecond, we explain the epistemic warrant for this calculation. The justification rests on the conceptual shift central to EBM and the broader \"statistical turn\" in science. The core challenge of causal inference, sometimes called the \"fundamental problem of causal inference,\" is that for any individual unit $i$, we can only ever observe one of its potential outcomes, either $Y_i(1)$ or $Y_i(0)$, but never both. Consequently, the individual treatment effect, $\\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$, is fundamentally unobservable.\n\nEBM addresses this by shifting the epistemic goal away from certainty about individuals (a deterministic, mechanistic goal) and toward probabilistic statements about populations. The ATE is precisely such a population-level quantity. It represents the average of all individual causal effects, $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_i]$, across the population.\n\nThe key is that while individual effects are unobservable and may be heterogeneous (i.e., $\\tau_i$ can vary from person to person), the average effect can be rigorously estimated under the procedural safeguard of randomization. Randomization creates two groups that are, in expectation, identical with respect to all pre-treatment characteristics, both measured and unmeasured. This is the power of the assumption $(Y(1), Y(0)) \\perp T$. It ensures there is no systematic difference between the groups other than the intervention itself. In non-randomized (observational) studies, this assumption is often violated due to confounding, where factors that influence treatment selection also influence the outcome.\n\nBecause the treatment and control groups are probabilistically equivalent at baseline, the control group serves as a valid statistical counterfactual for the treatment group. Any observed difference in average outcomes, $\\bar{Y}_{1} - \\bar{Y}_{0}$, is therefore an unbiased estimate of the average causal effect of the treatment. The statistical procedure bypasses the need to know any individual's causal effect or the specific biological mechanisms at play. EBM's epistemic commitment is to trust well-designed processes like RCTs to generate evidence. The validity of the causal claim about the population stems not from mechanistic certainty, but from the statistical properties of the experimental design which guarantee that, on average, the only thing differing between the groups is the treatment itself.",

            "problem": "A pivotal feature of the twentieth-century “statistical turn” in the history of medicine was the rise of randomized experiments that enabled causal claims about therapies under minimal assumptions. Consider an early Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) investigating a new therapy for a serious infectious disease. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the therapy or usual care at a $1:1$ allocation ratio, with no loss to follow-up. Let $Z$ denote treatment assignment, with $Z=1$ for therapy and $Z=0$ for usual care, and let $Y$ denote the binary outcome of $30$-day mortality, where $Y=1$ indicates death within $30$ days and $Y=0$ indicates survival.\n\nIn the therapy arm, $20$ of $100$ patients experienced $Y=1$. In the usual care arm, $35$ of $100$ patients experienced $Y=1$.

Compute the risk difference between therapy and usual care, defined as the difference in risks.\n2. Compute the risk ratio between therapy and usual care, defined as the ratio of risks.\n3. Provide a brief causal interpretation consistent with the logic of randomization and the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), stating what these estimates mean about the effect of therapy on $30$-day mortality under random assignment.\n\nExpress the numerical answers for the risk difference and risk ratio as exact fractions or decimals. If you choose decimals, round to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign; express proportions as decimals or fractions.",

It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a formal solution can be constructed.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of two \"effect measures\"—the risk difference and the risk ratio—and a causal interpretation of these estimates. We will proceed by first defining the relevant quantities and then computing the estimates from the provided data.\n\nLet $Z$ be the random variable for treatment assignment, where $Z=1$ indicates assignment to the therapy arm and $Z=0$ indicates assignment to the usual care arm. Let $Y$ be the binary outcome, where $Y=1$ denotes death within $30$ days and $Y=0$ denotes survival.\n\nThe data provided are:\n-   In the therapy arm ($Z=1$): $n_1 = 100$ patients, of whom $y_1 = 20$ experienced the outcome $Y=1$.\n-   In the usual care arm ($Z=0$): $n_0 = 100$ patients, of whom $y_0 = 35$ experienced the outcome $Y=1$.\n\nThe problem defines the risk in a group as the probability of the outcome in that group, which is estimated by the observed proportion.\n\nThe risk in the therapy arm, $R_1$, is estimated by $\\hat{R}_1$:\n$$ \\hat{R}_1 = P(Y=1|Z=1) = \\frac{y_1}{n_1} = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.20 $$\nThe risk in the usual care arm, $R_0$, is estimated by $\\hat{R}_0$:\n$$ \\hat{R}_0 = P(Y=1|Z=0) = \\frac{y_0}{n_0} = \\frac{35}{100} = 0.35 $$\n\nWith these estimated risks, we can address the three parts of the problem.\n\n1.  **Compute the risk difference (RD).**\nThe risk difference is defined as the difference in risks, $RD = R_1 - R_0$. Its estimate, $\\widehat{RD}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\widehat{RD} = \\hat{R}_1 - \\hat{R}_0 = 0.20 - 0.35 = -0.15 $$\nThis value is an exact decimal.\n\n2.  **Compute the risk ratio (RR).**\nThe risk ratio is defined as the ratio of risks, $RR = R_1 / R_0$. Its estimate, $\\widehat{RR}$, is calculated as:\n$$ \\widehat{RR} = \\frac{\\hat{R}_1}{\\hat{R}_0} = \\frac{0.20}{0.35} = \\frac{20}{35} = \\frac{4}{7} $$\nThis value is an exact fraction. As a decimal rounded to four significant figures, it is approximately $0.5714$. The exact fractional form is preferred for precision.\n\n3.  **Provide a brief causal interpretation.**\nThe power of an RCT lies in its ability to yield estimates that have a causal interpretation. This relies on the potential outcomes framework, where each patient $i$ has a potential outcome under therapy, $Y_i(1)$, and a potential outcome under usual care, $Y_i(0)$. The causal effect for patient $i$ is the difference $Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$, which is fundamentally unobservable. We instead estimate the Average Causal Effect (ACE), $E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$.\n\nRandomization ensures that, in expectation, the two groups are comparable with respect to all baseline characteristics, both measured and unmeasured. Formally, it makes the treatment assignment $Z$ independent of the potential outcomes $\\{Y(1), Y(0)\\}$. This implies $E[Y(1)|Z=1] = E[Y(1)]$ and $E[Y(0)|Z=0] = E[Y(0)]$.\n\nThe Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) posits that (a) there is no interference between patients and (b) there is only one version of the treatment and control. SUTVA allows us to equate the observed outcomes to the potential outcomes for each arm: for patients with $Z=1$, their observed outcome is $Y=Y(1)$, and for patients with $Z=0$, their observed outcome is $Y=Y(0)$.\n\nBecause of randomization and SUTVA, the expected value of the outcome in the therapy arm is the average potential outcome under therapy, $E[Y|Z=1] = E[Y(1)|Z=1] = E[Y(1)]$. Similarly, $E[Y|Z=0] = E[Y(0)|Z=0] = E[Y(0)]$. The risks $R_1$ and $R_0$ are these expected values, $R_1=E[Y(1)]$ and $R_0=E[Y(0)]$.\n\nTherefore, our statistical estimates are unbiased estimates of causal parameters:\n-   The risk difference estimate, $\\widehat{RD} = -0.15$, is an estimate of the Average Causal Effect: $ACE = E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)]$.\n-   The risk ratio estimate, $\\widehat{RR} = 4/7$, is an estimate of the causal risk ratio: $E[Y(1)] / E[Y(0)]$.\n\n**Causal Interpretation:**\nBased on this randomized experiment, we can infer the causal effect of the therapy.\n-   The risk difference of $-0.15$ implies that, on average, receiving the therapy caused an absolute reduction in the $30$-day mortality risk by $0.15$, or $15$ percentage points, compared to receiving usual care.\n-   The risk ratio of $4/7$ (approximately $0.5714$) implies that the therapy caused the risk of $30$-day mortality to be just over half of what it would have been under usual care. This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of $1 - 4/7 = 3/7$, or approximately $42.9\\%$.\n\nIn summary, the estimates derived from this RCT suggest that the new therapy has a substantial protective causal effect on $30$-day mortality.",
