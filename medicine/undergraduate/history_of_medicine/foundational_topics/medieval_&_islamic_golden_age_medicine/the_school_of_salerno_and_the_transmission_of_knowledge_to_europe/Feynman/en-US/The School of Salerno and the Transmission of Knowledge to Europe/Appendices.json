            "problem": "In the twelfth to thirteenth centuries, the School of Salerno (Schola Medica Salernitana) served as a hub for the formalization and transmission of medical training norms across Europe. Statutes associated with this tradition, later codified in the Kingdom of Sicily under Emperor Frederick II, required sequential stages of education: a period of formal study in logic, followed by extended medical instruction, and finally supervised practice before licensure. Assume a candidate begins formal studies at age $14$ and, in accordance with such statutes, completes $3$ years of logic, $5$ years of medicine, and $1$ year of supervised practice, with each stage occurring consecutively and without overlap or interruption. Using only the assumption that consecutive, non-overlapping durations add linearly, compute the total training time and determine the minimum age at which licensure would first be possible under these conditions. For grading, report only the minimum licensure age in years as an exact integer (no rounding required), expressed in years.",

You will use a system of \"degrees\" to balance the qualities of a compound remedy, applying a simple algebraic model to achieve a specific therapeutic effect.

            "id": "4778999",
            "problem": "In the twelfth-century framework used at the School of Salerno, remedies were compounded by balancing the four primary qualities—hot, cold, wet, and dry—each carried by simple ingredients in integer “degrees.” Within this Galenic tradition, widely adopted across Latin Europe, an apothecary evaluated a composite medicine along orthogonal axes: hot versus cold on one axis and wet versus dry on the other. A historically attested working rule in this tradition is linear additivity of degrees with respect to quantity: when combining simples, the contribution of each quality scales with the amount used and sums across the ingredients. Opposing qualities on the same axis offset one another, while qualities on different axes (for example, hot versus dry) do not directly interact.\n\nConsider reconstructing a Salernitan compound using this model. Assume per dram contributions as follows: ginger is assigned heat degree 2; cinnamon is assigned dryness degree 1; mint is assigned cold degree 1. Let $q_{g}$, $q_{c}$, and $q_{m}$ denote the number of drams of ginger, cinnamon, and mint, respectively. The apothecary fixes $q_{g} = 2$ to achieve a robust warming base and selects $q_{c} = 1$ to set dryness to degree $1$ for the vehicle; dryness does not affect the hot–cold axis. The therapeutic goal is a targeted net heat of degree $2$ on the hot–cold axis.\n\nUsing the additive model described above, determine the integer value of $q_{m}$ that achieves a net heat degree of $2$. Express your final answer as the number of drams of mint (a pure number). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem will first be validated against the specified criteria before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information and rules:\n-   **Model**: A twelfth-century Salernitan model based on four qualities (hot, cold, wet, dry) organized on two orthogonal axes (hot-cold and wet-dry).\n-   **Rule of Composition**: Linear additivity of \"degrees\" with respect to quantity. The contribution of each quality scales with the amount used and sums across ingredients.\n-   **Rule of Interaction**: Opposing qualities on the same axis (e.g., hot and cold) offset one another. Qualities on different axes (e.g., hot and dry) do not directly interact.\n-   **Ingredient Properties (per dram)**:\n    -   Ginger: heat degree $2$.\n    -   Cinnamon: dryness degree $1$.\n    -   Mint: cold degree $1$.\n-   **Variables**:\n    -   $q_g$: number of drams of ginger.\n    -   $q_c$: number of drams of cinnamon.\n    -   $q_m$: number of drams of mint.\n-   **Fixed Conditions**:\n    -   $q_g = 2$.\n    -   $q_c = 1$.\n-   **Therapeutic Goal**:\n    -   Achieve a net heat of degree $2$ on the hot-cold axis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is not scientifically unsound. It is framed within a historical medical theory (Galenic tradition), which is a historical fact. The task is not to validate this outdated theory against modern science but to perform a calculation based on the explicit rules of that historical model. The problem is therefore a valid exercise in applied mathematics and logic within a specified, self-contained system.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: the initial properties of the ingredients, the rules for their combination (linear additivity, orthogonality of axes), fixed quantities for some ingredients, and a clear, single objective. This structure allows for the determination of a unique solution.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language, free of subjective claims. Terms like \"degree\" and \"net heat\" are defined by their function within the model described.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is a formalizable logical puzzle, not a statement about physical reality.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\n### Solution Formulation\nThe problem requires balancing qualities on the hot-cold axis. The wet-dry axis is orthogonal and, as stated, qualities on it do not interact with the hot-cold axis. Therefore, the dryness of cinnamon is irrelevant to the calculation of net heat.\n\nLet's establish a numerical scale for the hot-cold axis. We can define 'heat' as a positive value and 'cold' as a negative value.\n-   The \"heat degree $2$\" of ginger corresponds to a value of $+2$.\n-   The \"cold degree $1$\" of mint corresponds to a value of $-1$.\n-   Cinnamon has a \"dryness degree $1$\", which lies on the orthogonal axis. Its contribution to the hot-cold axis is therefore $0$.\n\nLet $d_g$, $d_c$, and $d_m$ be the degrees of ginger, cinnamon, and mint on the hot-cold axis, respectively.\n-   $d_g = +2$\n-   $d_c = 0$\n-   $d_m = -1$\n\nThe quantities of each ingredient are given as $q_g$, $q_c$, and $q_m$.\n-   $q_g = 2$ drams.\n-   $q_c = 1$ dram.\n-   $q_m$ is the unknown number of drams of mint.\n\nAccording to the rule of linear additivity, the net degree on the hot-cold axis, which we denote as $H_{net}$, is the sum of the products of the quantity of each ingredient and its corresponding degree on that axis.\n$$H_{net} = (q_g \\cdot d_g) + (q_c \\cdot d_c) + (q_m \\cdot d_m)$$\n\nThe therapeutic goal is a net heat of degree $2$, so $H_{net} = 2$. We can now substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$2 = (2 \\cdot 2) + (1 \\cdot 0) + (q_m \\cdot (-1))$$\n\nSimplifying the expression on the right-hand side:\n$$2 = 4 + 0 - q_m$$\n$$2 = 4 - q_m$$\n\nNow, we solve for the unknown variable $q_m$:\n$$q_m = 4 - 2$$\n$$q_m = 2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the integer value of $q_m$. The calculation yields $q_m = 2$, which is an integer. Thus, $2$ drams of mint are required to achieve the desired net heat of degree $2$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of the fever hypothesis $F$ given the uroscopic observation $D$, denoted as $P(F \\mid D)$. The derivation will begin from the fundamental axioms and definitions of probability theory.\n\nThe definition of conditional probability states that for any two events $A$ and $B$, where $P(B) > 0$, the probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n$$\nP(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n$$\nApplying this definition to the events $F$ and $D$, we have:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{P(F \\cap D)}{P(D)}\n$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(F \\cap D)$, is the joint probability of both $F$ and $D$ occurring. It can be expressed using the multiplication rule, which is a rearrangement of the conditional probability definition: $P(F \\cap D) = P(D \\mid F)P(F)$. Substituting this into our expression gives:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid F)P(F)}{P(D)}\n$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(D)$, is the total probability of observing $D$. Since the events $F$ and $\\neg F$ form a partition of the sample space (i.e., they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive), the Law of Total Probability can be applied to express $P(D)$ as:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D \\cap F) + P(D \\cap \\neg F)\n$$\nAgain, using the multiplication rule for each term in the sum:\n$$\nP(D) = P(D \\mid F)P(F) + P(D \\mid \\neg F)P(\\neg F)\n$$\nSubstituting this full expression for $P(D)$ into our equation for $P(F \\mid D)$ yields the desired form, which is Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{P(D \\mid F)P(F)}{P(D \\mid F)P(F) + P(D \\mid \\neg F)P(\\neg F)}\n$$\nThis expression gives the posterior probability $P(F \\mid D)$ in terms of the provided quantities $P(D \\mid F)$, $P(D \\mid \\neg F)$, and $P(F)$, as well as the derivable term $P(\\neg F)$.\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Prior probability of fever: $P(F) = 0.3$\n-   Likelihood of observation $D$ given fever: $P(D \\mid F) = 0.6$\n-   Likelihood of observation $D$ given no fever: $P(D \\mid \\neg F) = 0.2$\n\nFrom the axiom that the sum of probabilities of a complete set of mutually exclusive events is $1$, we can find the prior probability of not having a fever, $P(\\neg F)$:\n$$\nP(\\neg F) = 1 - P(F) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7\n$$\nNow we substitute these numerical values into the derived formula for $P(F \\mid D)$:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{(0.6)(0.3)}{(0.6)(0.3) + (0.2)(0.7)}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n-   Numerator: $P(D \\mid F)P(F) = (0.6)(0.3) = 0.18$\n-   Denominator term 1: $(0.6)(0.3) = 0.18$\n-   Denominator term 2: $P(D \\mid \\neg F)P(\\neg F) = (0.2)(0.7) = 0.14$\n\nThe expression becomes:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.14} = \\frac{0.18}{0.32}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can write it as $\\frac{18}{32}$, which reduces to $\\frac{9}{16}$.\n\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\nP(F \\mid D) = \\frac{9}{16} = 0.5625\n$$\nThis value has exactly four significant figures.\n\nTo determine which hypothesis is more likely after observing $D$, we must also calculate the posterior probability of not having a fever, $P(\\neg F \\mid D)$. Since $F$ and $\\neg F$ are complementary events, it follows that:\n$$\nP(\\neg F \\mid D) = 1 - P(F \\mid D) = 1 - 0.5625 = 0.4375\n$$\nComparing the two posterior probabilities, $P(F \\mid D) = 0.5625$ and $P(\\neg F \\mid D) = 0.4375$, we find that $0.5625 > 0.4375$. Therefore, after the uroscopic observation $D$, the hypothesis of fever ($F$) is more likely than the hypothesis of no fever ($\\neg F$).\n\nThe problem, however, asks only for the numerical value of $P(F \\mid D)$.",
