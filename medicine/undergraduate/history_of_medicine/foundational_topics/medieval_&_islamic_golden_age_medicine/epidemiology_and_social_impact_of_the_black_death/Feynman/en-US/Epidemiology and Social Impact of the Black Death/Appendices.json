            "introduction": "Understanding how a pandemic moves across a landscape is a cornerstone of historical epidemiology. By tracking the timing of outbreaks in different locations, historians can map a disease's 'wavefront' and estimate its speed of advance. This exercise allows you to calculate this wavefront speed for the Black Death, a key piece of data that helps distinguish its transmission pattern from that of other major infectious diseases. ",

            "problem": "In reconstructing the epidemiological wavefront of the mid-fourteenth-century Black Death from chronicle-based first-mention and burial spike timings, historians often approximate the front’s overland advance by dividing overland distance by elapsed time between initial entry and the first mortality spike in a target city. Consider an inland city located $1{,}500$ km from the initial entry point of the pandemic into a given region, with the first clear mortality spike recorded $400$ days after that entry. Using the fundamental definition of average speed as distance divided by elapsed time, compute the average wavefront speed of the Black Death in kilometers per day.\n\nTo compare this with faster-spreading premodern diseases whose transmission was not tightly constrained by vector ecology, use the following historically grounded benchmarks: documentary syntheses place overland wavefronts for premodern influenza-like pandemics in the range $12$ to $18$ kilometers per day, and nineteenth-century cholera along inland waterways in the range $20$ to $30$ kilometers per day in the absence of rail and steamship acceleration. Take the midpoint of each range to represent each disease’s characteristic wavefront speed, then take the arithmetic mean of those two midpoints to construct a single composite benchmark speed.\n\nFinally, compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ defined as the Black Death’s average wavefront speed divided by this composite benchmark speed. Round your final result for $R$ to four significant figures. Express the final ratio as a pure decimal (no units).",

            "introduction": "Estimating the total mortality of the Black Death is complicated by the nature of medieval records, which are often more complete for urban centers than for rural areas. To overcome this bias, historians use stratified analysis to create a more robust picture of the overall impact. This practice demonstrates how to calculate a weighted average mortality rate, a crucial skill for synthesizing fragmented historical data into a coherent estimate. ",

            "problem": "A historian of medicine wishes to estimate the overall mortality proportion during the fourteenth-century Black Death by combining stratified evidence from urban and rural sources. In this period, urban ecclesiastical and municipal records were generally more complete than rural manorial records, creating unequal coverage across subpopulations. Let the total population be partitioned into an urban stratum and a rural stratum with subpopulation sizes $N_{u}$ and $N_{r}$ and death counts $D_{u}$ and $D_{r}$ during the epidemic. The mortality proportion in each stratum is defined by the fundamental epidemiological identity $m_{s} = D_{s}/N_{s}$ for stratum $s \\in \\{u,r\\}$, and the total mortality proportion is $m = D/N$ where $D = D_{u} + D_{r}$ and $N = N_{u} + N_{r}$. Assume that the available sources cover fractions $w_{u}$ and $w_{r}$ of the total population such that $w_{u} + w_{r} = 1$, and that the covered subpopulations are representative of their respective strata. Using only these definitions and the stratification $N = N_{u} + N_{r}$ and $D = D_{u} + D_{r}$, derive the expression for the overall mortality proportion $m$ in terms of $w_{u}$, $w_{r}$, $m_{u}$, and $m_{r}$. Then, for an empirical reconstruction in which urban sources cover $w_{u} = 0.70$ of the population with recorded mortality $m_{u} = 0.40$ and rural sources cover $w_{r} = 0.30$ with recorded mortality $m_{r} = 0.20$, compute the point estimate of the overall mortality proportion $m$ as a decimal fraction. Finally, discuss the sensitivity of this estimator to small errors in the coverage fractions by treating $w_{r} = 1 - w_{u}$ and considering the first-order change in $m$ due to a small perturbation in $w_{u}$. Express the overall mortality proportion as a decimal fraction (no percentage sign). No rounding requirement is imposed.",
            "solution": "**Part 1: Derivation of the overall mortality proportion $m$**\nThe overall mortality proportion is $m = D/N = (D_u + D_r) / (N_u + N_r)$. Using the stratum-specific mortality rates $m_u = D_u/N_u$ and $m_r = D_r/N_r$, we can write:\n$$m = \\frac{m_u N_u + m_r N_r}{N} = m_u \\left(\\frac{N_u}{N}\\right) + m_r \\left(\\frac{N_r}{N}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines $w_u$ and $w_r$ as coverage fractions of the total population that sum to one. This implies they represent the population weights of the strata, i.e., $w_u = N_u/N$ and $w_r = N_r/N$. Substituting these gives the standard formula for a weighted average:\n$$m = m_u w_u + m_r w_r$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the point estimate for $m$**\nThe problem states that sources for the urban stratum, with weight $w_u = 0.70$, show a mortality of $m_u = 0.40$, while sources for the rural stratum, with weight $w_r = 0.30$, show a mortality of $m_r = 0.20$.\n$$m = (0.40)(0.70) + (0.20)(0.30) = 0.28 + 0.06 = 0.34$$\nThe overall mortality proportion is $0.34$.\n\n**Part 3: Sensitivity analysis**\nTo discuss the sensitivity of the estimator, we express $m$ as a function of $w_u$, using the constraint $w_r = 1 - w_u$:\n$$m(w_u) = m_u w_u + m_r(1 - w_u) = (m_u - m_r)w_u + m_r$$\nThe sensitivity is the derivative $\\frac{dm}{dw_u} = m_u - m_r$.\nUsing the empirical values, the sensitivity is $0.40 - 0.20 = 0.20$. This means the overall estimate's sensitivity to errors in the population weights is the difference between the strata's mortality rates. Since urban mortality is higher, any error overestimating the urban population share will increase the overall mortality estimate. Specifically, for every percentage point of population weight shifted from rural to urban, the overall mortality estimate increases by 0.2 percentage points.",

            "introduction": "Beyond its demographic toll, the Black Death triggered profound economic changes, particularly for the laboring class. The sudden scarcity of workers dramatically altered the balance of power between laborers and lords, leading to significant shifts in wages. This exercise introduces the critical distinction between nominal wages (the currency amount) and real wages (purchasing power), guiding you through a calculation that reveals the tangible impact of the plague on the economic well-being of survivors.

            "problem": "In the immediate decades following the first wave of the Black Death in mid-fourteenth-century Europe, chroniclers and manorial accounts report substantial shifts in the economic conditions of rural laborers. Consider a stylized but historically plausible scenario: before the plague, the nominal daily wage of an agricultural worker is $w_0$ and the general price level (indexed to a pre-plague base) is $P_0 = 1$. After the demographic shock reduces the labor force and contracts output, nominal daily wages rise by $40\\%$ while the general price level rises by $10\\%$ relative to the base, yielding post-plague values $w_1$ and $P_1$. Using the standard economic-history definitions grounded in price index normalization and the concept of purchasing power, derive from first principles the proportional change in the real wage between the pre-plague and post-plague situations, and then, relying on core epidemiological facts about mortality-induced labor scarcity during the Black Death, infer in one sentence how this change plausibly affected living standards among agricultural workers. Express the final numerical quantity for the proportional change in real wages as a decimal or an exact fraction without a percent sign; if you choose a decimal, round to four significant figures.",
