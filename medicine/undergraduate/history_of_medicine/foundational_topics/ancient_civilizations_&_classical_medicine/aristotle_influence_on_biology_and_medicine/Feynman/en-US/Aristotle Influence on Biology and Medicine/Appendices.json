            "problem": "You are to select the decision tree that best conforms to Aristotle’s own classificatory practice in biology and yields correct classifications for three test animals: octopus, dolphin, and bee. Use as the fundamental base the following Aristotelian commitments, which you may assume as given: animals are first divided into those with red blood (enaima) and those without red blood (anaima); among red-blooded animals, differences in respiratory organ (lungs versus gills) and mode of reproduction (viviparous versus oviparous) are salient; among bloodless animals, Aristotle distinguishes cephalopods, crustaceans, testaceans, and insects by body covering, limb form, and segmentation. Do not prioritize modern taxonomic concepts or thermoregulation, and do not begin classification by habitat alone. Choose the option whose tree both reflects these principles and, when applied stepwise, correctly justifies the branch choices and end-classifications for all three cases: octopus, dolphin, and bee.\n\nWhich option provides a valid Aristotelian decision tree and correctly applies it to the three test cases?\n\nA. Decision tree:\n- First split: presence of red blood (enaima) versus absence of red blood (anaima).\n- Among red-blooded: split by respiratory organ into lungs versus gills; among lung-breathers, split by reproduction into viviparous versus oviparous.\n- Among bloodless: split by body condition and limb form into soft-bodied with arms and suckers (cephalopods), jointed-limbed with a crust-like covering (crustaceans), fixed external shells (testaceans), and segmented many-legged forms, sometimes winged (insects).\nApplication:\n- Octopus: no red blood → bloodless; soft-bodied with arms and suckers → cephalopod.\n- Dolphin: has red blood → red-blooded; breathes air with lungs → lung-breather; gives live birth → viviparous lung-breather (cetacean).\n- Bee: no red blood → bloodless; segmented with many legs and wings → insect (winged insect).\n\nB.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem asking to identify the correct Aristotelian decision tree for biological classification and to verify its application to three specific animals: an octopus, a dolphin, and a bee. The problem specifies the core principles of Aristotle's classification method to be used.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following principles and constraints for constructing the decision tree:\n1.  **Primary Division**: \"animals are first divided into those with red blood (enaima) and those without red blood (anaima)\".\n2.  **Division of Red-Blooded Animals (Enaima)**: \"among red-blooded animals, differences in respiratory organ (lungs versus gills) and mode of reproduction (viviparous versus oviparous) are salient\".\n3.  **Division of Bloodless Animals (Anaima)**: \"among bloodless animals, Aristotle distinguishes cephalopods, crustaceans, testaceans, and insects by body covering, limb form, and segmentation\".\n4.  **Exclusions and Constraints**:\n    *   \"Do not prioritize modern taxonomic concepts or thermoregulation\".\n    *   \"do not begin classification by habitat alone\".\n5.  **Test Cases**: The tree must yield correct classifications for three animals: octopus, dolphin, and bee.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is to be validated for its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is grounded in the history of science, specifically the biological work of Aristotle. The principles cited (enaima/anaima, viviparity/oviparity, lungs/gills) are accurate representations of his classificatory methods as detailed in texts like *Historia Animalium* and *De Partibus Animalium*. The problem does not present these as modern scientific facts but as the basis for a historical-logical exercise. It is therefore scientifically sound within its specified historical context.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear set of rules and asks for the evaluation of given options against these rules. The task is to identify the option that both follows the rules for building a decision tree and correctly applies it. This structure allows for a unique and verifiable solution among the choices.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, precise language. It defines the criteria for classification clearly and provides explicit constraints.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The provided information is sufficient to build a canonical Aristotelian decision tree and test the given cases. The constraints are consistent with the primary principles.\n5.  **Relevance**: The problem is directly relevant to the topic of Aristotle's influence on biology and can be formalized into a solvable logical problem.\n\n**Verdict**: The problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined, historically-grounded problem of applied logic. The process will now proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Correct Classification Scheme\nBased on the provided givens, an Aristotelian decision tree can be constructed.\n\n1.  The first and most fundamental division is between animals with red blood (enaima) and those without (anaima).\n    *   **Dolphin**: Has red blood. It is **enaima**.\n    *   **Octopus**: Lacks red blood (its blood is hemocyanin-based, not hemoglobin-based, and appears clear or blue). It is **anaima**.\n    *   **Bee**: Lacks red blood. It is **anaima**.\n\n2.  For **enaima** animals like the dolphin, the next salient divisions are by respiratory organ and mode of reproduction.\n    *   **Dolphin**: Breathes with **lungs** (not gills). It gives **live birth** (is viviparous). Therefore, Aristotle would classify it as a viviparous, lung-breathing animal. He grouped cetaceans (dolphins, whales) in a category with land mammals on this basis, explicitly separating them from fish.\n\n3.  For **anaima** animals like the octopus and the bee, the divisions are based on body characteristics.\n    *   **Octopus**: It is a soft-bodied animal (*malakia* in Greek) with prominent limbs (arms) and suckers. This places it in the group Aristotle called **Cephalopoda**.\n    *   **Bee**: It is an animal with a segmented body and multiple jointed legs (an *entomon*). This places it in the group Aristotle called **Insecta**. The presence of wings is a further differentiating characteristic within this group.\n\nThis derived scheme will serve as the standard against which the options are evaluated.\n\n### Step 4: Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A**\n*   **Decision Tree**:\n    *   The first split is \"presence of red blood (enaima) versus absence of red blood (anaima)\". This matches the primary division specified in the problem givens.\n    *   The path for red-blooded animals splits by \"respiratory organ into lungs versus gills\" and then by \"reproduction into viviparous versus oviparous\". This matches the specified criteria for enaima.\n    *   The path for bloodless animals splits into \"cephalopods, crustaceans, testaceans, and insects\" based on body condition. This matches the specified criteria for anaima.\n    The decision tree is fully compliant with the problem's rules.\n*   **Application**:\n    *   **Octopus**: correctly identified as bloodless (anaima) and then classified as a cephalopod based on its soft body and arms. This is correct.\n    *   **Dolphin**: correctly identified as red-blooded (enaima), a lung-breather, and viviparous. The classification as a \"viviparous lung-breather (cetacean)\" is historically accurate to Aristotle's careful distinction. This is correct.\n    *   **Bee**: correctly identified as bloodless (anaima) and then classified as an insect based on its segmented body and legs. This is correct.\n*   **Verdict**: **Correct**. Both the tree structure and its application are valid according to the problem's premises.\n\n**Option B**\n*   **Decision Tree**: The first split is based on habitat (\"aquatic versus terrestrial versus aerial\"). This directly violates the constraint \"do not begin classification by habitat alone\". Aristotle used habitat as a characteristic, but not as the primary division of all animals.\n*   **Application**:\n    *   **Octopus: aquatic → fish**. Incorrect. Aristotle distinguished cephalopods from fish.\n    *   **Dolphin: aquatic → fish**. Incorrect. This is a major error, as Aristotle's fame in biology partly rests on his recognition that dolphins are not fish (they are viviparous lung-breathers).\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The fundamental principle of the decision tree violates an explicit constraint, and the resulting classifications are wrong.\n\n**Option C**\n*   **Decision Tree**: The first split is based on reproduction (\"viviparous versus oviparous\"). While this is a key Aristotelian differentia, the problem states it is salient *among red-blooded animals*, not that it is the first division for *all* animals. The primary division is specified as enaima/anaima.\n*   **Application**:\n    *   **Dolphin: viviparous → fish that are viviparous**. Incorrect. This classification is confusing and contradicts Aristotle's work, which placed cetaceans *apart* from fish.\n    *   **Bee: oviparous → grouped with birds and fishes**. Incorrect. This grouping violates the primary enaima/anaima division, as bees are anaima while birds and fishes are enaima.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The primary division is wrong, and the applications lead to groupings that contradict fundamental Aristotelian categories.\n\n**Option D**\n*   **Decision Tree**: The first split is by the number of legs (0, 2, 4, or >4). This is not the primary division specified in the givens. Like habitat and reproduction, locomotion was a differentia used by Aristotle, but not the foundational one.\n*   **Application**:\n    *   **Octopus: has 8 limbs → >4 → insect**. Grossly incorrect. Aristotle had a distinct and correct category for the octopus (Cephalopoda) and would not have classified it as an insect.\n    *   **Dolphin: no legs → 0 → fish-like**. Incorrect. This ignores the more significant (to Aristotle) features of having lungs and being viviparous, which separates dolphins from fish.\n    *   **Bee: has 6 legs → >4 → insect**. While the final classification is correct, it is reached via a flawed and oversimplified tree that fails for the other cases.\n*   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The decision tree's primary division is inconsistent with the problem statement, and it produces demonstrably false classifications from an Aristotelian standpoint.\n\n### Conclusion\nOnly Option A presents a decision tree that is consistent with the stipulated Aristotelian principles and correctly applies that tree to classify the octopus, dolphin, and bee.",

            "introduction": "A scientific framework is defined as much by the questions it cannot easily answer as by those it can. Aristotle, a meticulous observer, noted that cetaceans (like dolphins) possessed features that defied his neat categories—they lived in water like fish but breathed air and gave live birth like land animals.

            "problem": "Aristotle’s natural philosophy emphasized classification by essence, using a genus–differentia structure where stable, causally explanatory features were treated as essential and habitat or locomotion could be treated as accidental. In his biological works, Aristotle distinguishes animals with blood from those without, and records observations relevant to cetaceans such as air-breathing with lungs, live-bearing reproduction, and nursing of young. Assume as a fundamental base that: (i) in Aristotelian method, essential features are those that explain an animal’s capacities and development, while accidental features are those contingent on environment; (ii) Aristotle lacked experimental dissection at scale and formal trait-weighting procedures; and (iii) any classification rule must be framed in concepts and observations available to a philosopher-naturalist of his era.\n\nWhich option best identifies the epistemic constraints that made it difficult for Aristotle to group cetaceans with what we now call mammals, and also proposes a historically plausible counterfactual classification rule (expressible in Aristotelian terms) that would have led to cetaceans being grouped with mammals rather than with fish?\n\nA. Constraints: An essentialist commitment to form and teleology that privileged mode of locomotion and habitat in identifying higher genera, limited systematic access to internal anatomy, and no formal method for weighting conflicting traits. Counterfactual rule: Define the highest relevant genus by reproductive and neonatal-nutritional features and respiration—animals that are viviparous, feed their young with milk, and breathe air with lungs belong together—while treating aquatic habitat and swimming as accidental differentiae.\n\nB.

Constraints: Absence of the concept of common ancestry and evolutionary descent, which made natural groupings impossible. Counterfactual rule: Adopt a phylogenetic criterion of shared descent, grouping taxa by hypothesized genealogical trees inferred from inherited traits.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is historically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It presents a solvable problem in the history and philosophy of science.\n\nThe central task is to identify the epistemic barriers within Aristotle's own philosophical system that prevented him from grouping cetaceans (dolphins, whales) with land-dwelling viviparous quadrupeds (what we now call mammals), despite his own recorded observations of their shared key biological functions. Furthermore, a counterfactual classificatory rule must be proposed that is consistent with the concepts and observations available to Aristotle.\n\nBased on the problem statement, Aristotle's methodology relies on a genus-differentia structure to classify organisms by their \"essence.\" Essential features are those that are stable and causally explanatory, while accidental features are contingent. The problem states that Aristotle observed that cetaceans breathe air with lungs, bear live young (viviparity), and nurse their young. These are profound biological characteristics related to reproduction and life maintenance, which, according to premise (i), should qualify as \"essential.\" However, cetaceans also possess a fish-like external form, inhabit the water, and use fins for locomotion.\n\nThe puzzle arises from this conflict of characters. Why did the latter set of traits (habitat, form, locomotion) effectively overrule the former set (respiration, reproduction, lactation) in Aristotle's practical classification, leading him to place cetaceans in a category closer to fish? Premise (ii) provides the crucial clue: Aristotle \"lacked... formal trait-weighting procedures.\" In the absence of a rigorous method for deciding which traits are more fundamental when they conflict, the most visually salient features—overall body form and habitat—could easily take precedence, even if his own philosophy suggested that features like mode of reproduction were more essential. Premise (iii) requires that any proposed alternative rule must be framed in concepts available to Aristotle.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. Constraints: \"An essentialist commitment to form and teleology that privileged mode of locomotion and habitat in identifying higher genera, limited systematic access to internal anatomy, and no formal method for weighting conflicting traits.\" This correctly identifies the core issue. While Aristotle's theory allowed for habitat and locomotion to be \"accidental,\" in practice, the overall form (*morphe*) and way of life were given immense weight. The lack of a formal weighting method meant that when the \"mammalian\" reproductive and respiratory traits conflicted with the \"fish-like\" morphological and environmental traits, there was no clear procedure to resolve the conflict, leading to a classification based on the more obvious external features.\nCounterfactual rule: \"Define the highest relevant genus by reproductive and neonatal-nutritional features and respiration—animals that are viviparous, feed their young with milk, and breathe air with lungs belong together—while treating aquatic habitat and swimming as accidental differentiae.\" This rule is historically plausible and consistent with Aristotelian thought. It uses only the observations he made. It resolves the conflict by explicitly elevating the features related to reproduction and respiration to the status of primary, essential differentiae for defining the highest genus, while demoting habitat and locomotion to the status of secondary, accidental differentiae used to distinguish species within that genus. This is a change in weighting, not a change in fundamental philosophy or available data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Constraints: \"Absence of microscopes to resolve cellular structure of mammary alveoli and lack of knowledge of the 3 middle ear bones, which prevented the recognition of uniquely mammalian microanatomy.\" These are anachronistic constraints. The problem asks for the epistemic constraints *within Aristotle's system*. Pointing to technology he did not have is an external critique, not an internal analysis. The core classification problem existed with the macroscopic data he already possessed.\nCounterfactual rule: \"Classify animals by microscopic glandular histology and ossicular chain morphology.\" This rule is impossible for Aristotle to have formulated or applied. It directly violates premise (iii), which requires concepts and observations available in his era.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nC. Constraints: \"Commitment to Hippocratic–Galenic 4-humor physiology that imposed humoral balance as the master explanatory scheme for all organic phenomena.\" This is historically imprecise. The rigid 4-humor system is more characteristic of Galen, who lived centuries after Aristotle. While Aristotle used qualities like \"hot/cold\" and \"wet/dry,\" his physiological framework was centered on the soul (`psyche`) and vital heat, not the Galenic humoral system.\nCounterfactual rule: \"Group animals primarily by relative “heat” and moisture, such that the warm and moist kinds form a single highest genus distinct from the cold and dry.\" Although Aristotle did consider viviparous animals \"hotter\" than egg-laying ones, this criterion is less specific and comprehensive than a rule based on the triad of viviparity, lactation, and lung-breathing. This rule does not resolve the conflict with external form as directly as the rule in option A. The issue was not that he couldn't conceive of \"hot\" animals as a group, but that this was one criterion among many without a clear hierarchy.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. Constraints: \"Absence of the concept of common ancestry and evolutionary descent, which made natural groupings impossible.\" This is another anachronistic constraint. Aristotle's system was explicitly static and non-evolutionary, based on an eternal hierarchy of forms (*scala naturae*). To critique it for lacking a concept of evolution is to misunderstand its fundamental goals and premises. The question is about the internal logic of his static system, not its failure to be a modern evolutionary one.\nCounterfactual rule: \"Adopt a phylogenetic criterion of shared descent, grouping taxa by hypothesized genealogical trees inferred from inherited traits.\" This is a modern, post-Darwinian concept. It is fundamentally non-Aristotelian and violates premise (iii).\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A accurately identifies the methodological and epistemic constraints within Aristotle's own framework—specifically, the problem of weighting conflicting characters—and proposes a counterfactual rule that is a plausible and logical modification of his own principles, using only observations he had available. It is the only option that correctly operates within the historical and philosophical boundaries set by the problem.",

            "introduction": "The scientific revolution was driven by a new emphasis on quantitative measurement to test long-held theories. This practice provides a powerful example of this principle by contrasting Aristotle’s physiological model of blood production with William Harvey’s model of circulation. By creating a simplified quantitative prediction based on Aristotle's qualitative ideas, you can calculate a \"discrepancy metric\" against modern data, offering a concrete measure of how and why Harvey's work supplanted a two-thousand-year-old doctrine .",

            "problem": "A central difference between Aristotle’s heart-centric physiology and William Harvey’s circulatory physiology is whether blood recirculates in a closed loop. Aristotle held that the heart is the source of vital heat and motion and that veins (arising from the liver) distribute nutritive blood to tissues without true return, while arteries are primarily conduits of pneuma with only incidental blood. In contrast, Harvey demonstrated a closed circulatory loop in which volumetric flow is conserved: total venous return equals total cardiac output, and blood transits organs and returns to the heart.\n\nConsider a healthy adult at rest with cardiac output $Q = 5.0$ L/min. Modern measurements (taken here as observed values) at four sites are:\n- Aortic root just distal to the heart: observed magnitude $F_{A}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q$.\n- Vena cava just proximal to the right atrium: observed magnitude $F_{V}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q$.\n- Hepatic vein (total hepatic venous outflow): observed magnitude $F_{H}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.25\\,Q$.\n- Renal artery (total inflow to both kidneys): observed magnitude $F_{R}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.20\\,Q$.\n\nUse steady-state conservation of mass for flow as the fundamental base: in a closed loop, inflow equals outflow at the system level, and at each organ, inflow equals outflow plus net consumption. To create a quantitative Aristotelian prediction for comparison, adopt the following simplifying assumptions consistent with his qualitative model:\n- At rest, arteries carry negligible blood volume compared to pneuma; take predicted aortic blood flow $F_{A}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0$.\n- Blood is generated in the liver at a constant rate $P$ and consumed by tissues at rate $P$ with no recirculation; take $P = 2.0$ L/day and convert to L/min.\n- The venous system is distributive from the liver; the magnitude of venous flow in the segment measured at the hepatic vein and in the vena cava near the heart is $F_{H}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = P$ and $F_{V}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = P$, respectively (direction may be opposite to modern observations; compare magnitudes).\n- The renal artery carries negligible blood in this model; take $F_{R}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0$.\n\nDefine the discrepancy metric $M$ as the sum over these four sites of the squared relative deviation between predicted and observed magnitudes,\n$$\nM \\equiv \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,V,H,R\\}} \\left(\\frac{F_{i}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{i}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{i}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2}.\n$$\nCompute $M$ using the above data and assumptions.

It is a well-structured, scientifically-grounded exercise in quantitative model comparison.

The metric is defined as:\n$$\nM = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,V,H,R\\}} \\left(\\frac{F_{i}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{i}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{i}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nwhere the index $i$ corresponds to four measurement sites: Aortic root ($A$), Vena cava ($V$), Hepatic vein ($H$), and Renal artery ($R$).\n\nFirst, we establish the numerical values for the observed flows ($F_{i}^{\\mathrm{obs}}$) based on the given cardiac output, $Q = 5.0$ L/min.\n*   Aortic root observed flow: $F_{A}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q = 5.0$ L/min.\n*   Vena cava observed flow: $F_{V}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = Q = 5.0$ L/min.\n*   Hepatic vein observed flow: $F_{H}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.25\\,Q = 0.25 \\times 5.0 \\text{ L/min} = 1.25$ L/min.\n*   Renal artery observed flow: $F_{R}^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 0.20\\,Q = 0.20 \\times 5.0 \\text{ L/min} = 1.0$ L/min.\n\nNext, we establish the numerical values for the predicted flows ($F_{i}^{\\mathrm{pred}}$) based on the assumptions for the Aristotelian model. The blood generation rate $P$ is given as $2.0$ L/day. We must convert this to L/min.\n$$\n1 \\text{ day} = 24 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{hour}} = 1440 \\text{ min}\n$$\nTherefore, the rate $P$ in L/min is:\n$$\nP = \\frac{2.0 \\text{ L}}{1 \\text{ day}} = \\frac{2.0 \\text{ L}}{1440 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{1}{720} \\text{ L/min}\n$$\nNow, we can state the predicted flows:\n*   Aortic root predicted flow: $F_{A}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0$ L/min.\n*   Vena cava predicted flow: $F_{V}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = P = \\frac{1}{720}$ L/min.\n*   Hepatic vein predicted flow: $F_{H}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = P = \\frac{1}{720}$ L/min.\n*   Renal artery predicted flow: $F_{R}^{\\mathrm{pred}} = 0$ L/min.\n\nWith all observed and predicted values determined, we can compute each term of the sum for $M$.\n\nTerm for Aorta ($i=A$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{F_{A}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{A}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{A}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0 - 5.0}{5.0}\\right)^{2} = (-1)^{2} = 1\n$$\n\nTerm for Vena Cava ($i=V$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{F_{V}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{V}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{V}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{720} - 5.0}{5.0}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{720 \\times 5.0} - 1\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{3600} - 1\\right)^{2} = \\left(-\\frac{3599}{3600}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNumerically, this term is approximately $( -0.999722... )^{2} \\approx 0.9994445987...$\n\nTerm for Hepatic Vein ($i=H$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{F_{H}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{H}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{H}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{720} - 1.25}{1.25}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{720 \\times 1.25} - 1\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{900} - 1\\right)^{2} = \\left(-\\frac{899}{900}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNumerically, this term is approximately $( -0.99888... )^{2} \\approx 0.9977790123...$\n\nTerm for Renal Artery ($i=R$):\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{F_{R}^{\\mathrm{pred}} - F_{R}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}{F_{R}^{\\mathrm{obs}}}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{0 - 1.0}{1.0}\\right)^{2} = (-1)^{2} = 1\n$$\n\nFinally, we sum the four terms to find $M$:\n$$\nM = 1 + \\left(-\\frac{3599}{3600}\\right)^{2} + \\left(-\\frac{899}{900}\\right)^{2} + 1\n$$\n$$\nM \\approx 1 + 0.9994445987 + 0.9977790123 + 1\n$$\n$$\nM \\approx 3.997223611\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $3$, $9$, $9$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\nM \\approx 3.997\n$$\nThe dimensionless discrepancy metric $M$ is a large number, close to the maximum possible value of $4$ for this specific set of assumptions, indicating a very poor fit of the Aristotelian model to the observed data.",
