Dioscorides noted the pain-relieving properties of willow bark, a fact we now attribute to the compound salicin, a natural precursor to salicylic acid.

            "problem": "In Pedanius Dioscorides’s treatise De materia medica, willow bark is described as useful for alleviating pain. Modern analysis connects this efficacy to the glycoside salicin, which can yield the pharmacologically active salicylic acid under hydrolysis and subsequent oxidation. Consider a historically plausible decoction scenario: dried willow bark contains a mean salicin mass fraction $f_{s} = 0.0125$; the simmering extraction brings a fraction $E = 0.60$ of the bark’s salicin into the water; and the fraction that is ultimately converted to salicylic acid (that is, the overall hydrolysis plus oxidation yield relevant to “salicylic equivalent”) is $F_{\\text{conv}} = 0.90$. Assume complete stoichiometric conversion of extracted salicin to salicylic acid on a per-mole basis, modulated by $F_{\\text{conv}}$ as an efficiency factor, and neglect other losses.\n\nUse mass conservation and chemical stoichiometry to determine the mass of dried willow bark required to prepare a decoction that delivers a salicylic acid equivalent of $300$ mg. For molar mass calculations, use the chemical formulas salicin $\\text{C}_{13}\\text{H}_{18}\\text{O}_7$ and salicylic acid $\\text{C}_{7}\\text{H}_{6}\\text{O}_3$, with atomic weights $M_{\\text{C}} = 12.011 \\text{ g/mol}$, $M_{\\text{H}} = 1.008 \\text{ g/mol}$, and $M_{\\text{O}} = 15.999 \\text{ g/mol}$.\n\nExpress your final answer in grams and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the mass of dried willow bark, denoted as $m_{\\text{bark}}$, required to produce a decoction containing a salicylic acid equivalent of $m_{\\text{SA, target}} = 300$ mg. The solution requires a step-by-step calculation that works backward from the final product (salicylic acid) to the initial raw material (willow bark), accounting for stoichiometric relationships and process efficiencies.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the molar masses of salicin ($\\text{C}_{13}\\text{H}_{18}\\text{O}_7$) and salicylic acid ($\\text{C}_{7}\\text{H}_{6}\\text{O}_3$) using the provided atomic weights.\n\nThe molar mass of salicin, $M_{\\text{salicin}}$, is:\n$$M_{\\text{salicin}} = 13 \\times M_{\\text{C}} + 18 \\times M_{\\text{H}} + 7 \\times M_{\\text{O}}$$\n$$M_{\\text{salicin}} = 13 \\times 12.011 + 18 \\times 1.008 + 7 \\times 15.999$$\n$$M_{\\text{salicin}} = 156.143 + 18.144 + 111.993 = 286.280 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n\nThe molar mass of salicylic acid, $M_{\\text{SA}}$, is:\n$$M_{\\text{SA}} = 7 \\times M_{\\text{C}} + 6 \\times M_{\\text{H}} + 3 \\times M_{\\text{O}}$$\n$$M_{\\text{SA}} = 7 \\times 12.011 + 6 \\times 1.008 + 3 \\times 15.999$$\n$$M_{\\text{SA}} = 84.077 + 6.048 + 47.997 = 138.122 \\text{ g/mol}$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the mass of the starting material and the final product. The process involves three main stages: the presence of salicin in the bark, its extraction into water, and its conversion to salicylic acid.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{bark}}$ be the mass of the dried willow bark.\nThe mass of salicin contained within this bark, $m_{\\text{salicin, in bark}}$, is given by the mass fraction $f_{s} = 0.0125$:\n$$m_{\\text{salicin, in bark}} = m_{\\text{bark}} \\times f_{s}$$\nDuring the simmering decoction, only a fraction $E = 0.60$ of this salicin is extracted. The mass of extracted salicin is:\n$$m_{\\text{salicin, extracted}} = m_{\\text{salicin, in bark}} \\times E = m_{\\text{bark}} \\times f_{s} \\times E$$\n\nThe conversion from salicin to salicylic acid is based on a $1:1$ molar stoichiometry. The actual mass of salicylic acid produced, $m_{\\text{SA, target}}$, is found by converting the mass of extracted salicin to moles, applying the molar ratio and the conversion yield ($F_{\\text{conv}} = 0.90$), and then converting back to the mass of salicylic acid.\n$$m_{\\text{SA, target}} = \\left( (m_{\\text{bark}} \\times f_{s} \\times E) \\times \\frac{1}{M_{\\text{salicin}}} \\right) \\times \\frac{M_{\\text{SA}}}{1} \\times F_{\\text{conv}}$$\n\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the required mass of willow bark, $m_{\\text{bark}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{bark}} = m_{\\text{SA, target}} \\times \\left( \\frac{M_{\\text{salicin}}}{M_{\\text{SA}}} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{f_{s} \\times E \\times F_{\\text{conv}}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression. The target mass $m_{\\text{SA, target}} = 300$ mg must be converted to grams: $m_{\\text{SA, target}} = 0.300$ g.\n$$m_{\\text{bark}} = 0.300 \\text{ g} \\times \\left( \\frac{286.280 \\text{ g/mol}}{138.122 \\text{ g/mol}} \\right) \\times \\frac{1}{0.0125 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.90}$$\n\nLet's calculate the components of the expression:\nThe mass ratio adjusted for stoichiometry is:\n$$\\frac{M_{\\text{salicin}}}{M_{\\text{SA}}} = \\frac{286.280}{138.122} \\approx 2.07267$$\nThe combined efficiency factor in the denominator is:\n$$f_{s} \\times E \\times F_{\\text{conv}} = 0.0125 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.90 = 0.00675$$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $m_{\\text{bark}}$:\n$$m_{\\text{bark}} = 0.300 \\times 2.07267 \\times \\frac{1}{0.00675}$$\n$$m_{\\text{bark}} = \\frac{0.300 \\times 2.07267}{0.00675} \\approx \\frac{0.621801}{0.00675} \\approx 92.11866 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$m_{\\text{bark}} \\approx 92.1 \\text{ g}$$\n\nThus, approximately $92.1$ grams of dried willow bark would be required to prepare a decoction delivering a salicylic acid equivalent of $300$ mg under the specified conditions.",

            "problem": "In the first century, Pedanius Dioscorides compiled \"De materia medica,\" a systematic pharmacognosy in which crude plant preparations were described by qualitative actions and typical amounts for adult users. Consider a historically plausible modeling exercise: suppose Dioscorides described a typical adult dose of dried willow bark (Salix) preparation as $2.0$ grams for an adult of body mass $64$ kilograms. You wish to formalize an allometric dose function $d(w) = k w^{\\alpha}$ that scales dose $d$ with body mass $w$, where $k$ and $\\alpha$ are constants to be determined from pharmacokinetic reasoning.\n\nUse a fundamental base consisting of widely accepted principles of Pharmacokinetics (PK) and comparative physiology, without appealing to untested shortcuts:\n\n- In a one-compartment, first-order elimination framework, maintaining comparable average exposure across body sizes for the same dosing interval and formulation requires that the administered dose covary proportionally with systemic clearance when bioavailability and dosing interval are held fixed across sizes.\n\n- For perfusion-limited, hepatically metabolized xenobiotics with similar formulation and route, systemic clearance exhibits allometric scaling across mammalian body sizes with an exponent near the metabolic-rate exponent, which is well supported to be approximately $\\frac{3}{4}$, whereas geometric similarity implies surface-area scaling with exponent $\\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nYour tasks are:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of an allometric dose function $d(w) = k w^{\\alpha}$ for a willow bark preparation. This involves two steps: first, justifying the choice of the scaling exponent $\\alpha$, and second, calibrating the constant $k$ to compute a specific dose. The analysis will be based on the provided pharmacokinetic and physiological principles.\n\n**1. Justification of the Scaling Exponent $\\alpha$**\n\nThe problem provides a fundamental principle of pharmacokinetics (PK) for maintaining comparable drug exposure across different body sizes. For a given bioavailability $F$ and dosing interval $\\tau$, the average steady-state drug concentration, which is a measure of exposure, is proportional to the ratio of dose $D$ to systemic clearance $CL$. To maintain constant exposure across a range of body masses $w$, this ratio must be held constant:\n$$ \\frac{D(w)}{CL(w)} = \\text{constant} $$\nThis implies that the dose $D(w)$ must be scaled in direct proportion to the systemic clearance $CL(w)$:\n$$ D(w) \\propto CL(w) $$\nThe problem states that the dose function is of the allometric form $d(w) = k w^{\\alpha}$. For this to be consistent with the PK principle, the systemic clearance $CL(w)$ must also follow an allometric relationship with the same exponent:\n$$ CL(w) \\propto w^{\\alpha} $$\nThe problem presents two potential scaling exponents for physiological variables based on body mass: $\\frac{2}{3}$ and $\\frac{3}{4}$. The exponent $\\frac{2}{3}$ arises from simple geometric similarity, where physiological parameters are assumed to scale with surface area. The exponent $\\frac{3}{4}$ arises from the scaling of metabolic rate across species (Kleiber's law).\n\nThe problem specifies that for \"perfusion-limited, hepatically metabolized xenobiotics,\" systemic clearance scales with an exponent \"near the metabolic-rate exponent.\" Willow bark's active component, salicin, is converted to salicylic acid, which is primarily metabolized in the liver. This is the relevant physiological scenario. Systemic clearance is a measure of the body's efficiency in eliminating a drug, a process driven by metabolic activity. Consequently, scaling clearance according to metabolic rate is mechanistically superior to scaling by surface area.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the scaling exponent for clearance, and thus for dose, should be the metabolic-rate exponent. Therefore, we must choose:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{3}{4} $$\n\n**2. Calibration of $k$ and Calculation of the Dose**\n\nWith the exponent determined, the dose function is:\n$$ d(w) = k w^{3/4} $$\nWe are given a reference point: a dose $d_{\\text{ref}} = 2.0\\,\\text{g}$ for an adult with body mass $w_{\\text{ref}} = 64\\,\\text{kg}$. We can use a ratiometric approach to find the new dose. Let $d_1$ and $w_1$ be the reference dose and weight, and $d_2$ and $w_2$ be the child's dose and weight.\n$$ d_1 = 2.0\\,\\text{g} \\quad \\text{at} \\quad w_1 = 64\\,\\text{kg} $$\n$$ d_2 = ? \\quad \\text{at} \\quad w_2 = 16\\,\\text{kg} $$\nThe ratio of the two doses is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d_2}{d_1} = \\frac{k w_2^{\\alpha}}{k w_1^{\\alpha}} = \\left(\\frac{w_2}{w_1}\\right)^{\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting the known values and the chosen exponent $\\alpha = \\frac{3}{4}$:\n$$ d_2 = d_1 \\left(\\frac{w_2}{w_1}\\right)^{3/4} = 2.0 \\left(\\frac{16}{64}\\right)^{3/4} $$\nFirst, simplify the ratio of the masses:\n$$ \\frac{16}{64} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $d_2$:\n$$ d_2 = 2.0 \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{3/4} $$\nTo evaluate the term $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{3/4}$, we can use exponent rules:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^{3/4} = \\frac{1^{3/4}}{4^{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{(2^2)^{3/4}} = \\frac{1}{2^{2 \\times 3/4}} = \\frac{1}{2^{3/2}} $$\nThe term $2^{3/2}$ is $2^{1} \\cdot 2^{1/2} = 2\\sqrt{2}$. So, the scaling factor is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} $$\nNow we can compute the final dose for the child:\n$$ d_2 = 2.0 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we use the value of $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$:\n$$ d_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.70710678... \\text{ g} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ d_2 \\approx 0.7071\\,\\text{g} $$",
