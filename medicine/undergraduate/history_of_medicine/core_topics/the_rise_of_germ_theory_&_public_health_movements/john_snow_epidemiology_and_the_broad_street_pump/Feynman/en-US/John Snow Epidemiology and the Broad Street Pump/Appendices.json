To address confounding by SES, you will pool stratum-specific information using the Mantel–Haenszel approach.\n\nTwo SES strata were constructed from parish records:\n\n- Lower SES stratum: among households that drank primarily from the Broad Street pump, there were $a_{1} = 90$ cholera cases out of $N_{1,1} = 180$ exposed households; among households that did not drink from the Broad Street pump, there were $c_{1} = 12$ cholera cases out of $N_{0,1} = 120$ unexposed households.\n- Higher SES stratum: among households that drank primarily from the Broad Street pump, there were $a_{2} = 18$ cholera cases out of $N_{1,2} = 60$ exposed households; among households that did not drink from the Broad Street pump, there were $c_{2} = 12$ cholera cases out of $N_{0,2} = 240$ unexposed households.\n\nUsing Mantel–Haenszel pooling across these two SES strata, compute the adjusted RR for Broad Street pump exposure.

It violates none of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe Mantel-Haenszel estimator for the adjusted Relative Risk ($RR_{MH}$) across $k$ strata in a cohort study is a weighted average given by the formula:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{a_i N_{0,i}}{T_i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\frac{c_i N_{1,i}}{T_i}} $$\nwhere for each stratum $i$:\n- $a_i$ is the number of cases in the exposed group.\n- $c_i$ is the number of cases in the unexposed group.\n- $N_{1,i}$ is the total number of individuals in the exposed group.\n- $N_{0,i}$ is the total number of individuals in the unexposed group.\n- $T_i = N_{1,i} + N_{0,i}$ is the total number of individuals in the stratum.\n\nWe have two strata ($k=2$).\n\n**Stratum 1 (Lower SES):**\n- Cases in exposed, $a_1 = 90$\n- Total exposed, $N_{1,1} = 180$\n- Cases in unexposed, $c_1 = 12$\n- Total unexposed, $N_{0,1} = 120$\n- Total in stratum 1, $T_1 = N_{1,1} + N_{0,1} = 180 + 120 = 300$\n\n**Stratum 2 (Higher SES):**\n- Cases in exposed, $a_2 = 18$\n- Total exposed, $N_{1,2} = 60$\n- Cases in unexposed, $c_2 = 12$\n- Total unexposed, $N_{0,2} = 240$\n- Total in stratum 2, $T_2 = N_{1,2} + N_{0,2} = 60 + 240 = 300$\n\nNow, we compute the terms for the numerator and denominator of the $RR_{MH}$ formula.\n\nNumerator contribution from stratum 1:\n$$ \\frac{a_1 N_{0,1}}{T_1} = \\frac{90 \\times 120}{300} = \\frac{10800}{300} = 36 $$\nNumerator contribution from stratum 2:\n$$ \\frac{a_2 N_{0,2}}{T_2} = \\frac{18 \\times 240}{300} = \\frac{4320}{300} = 14.4 $$\nTotal numerator:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{a_i N_{0,i}}{T_i} = 36 + 14.4 = 50.4 $$\n\nDenominator contribution from stratum 1:\n$$ \\frac{c_1 N_{1,1}}{T_1} = \\frac{12 \\times 180}{300} = \\frac{2160}{300} = 7.2 $$\nDenominator contribution from stratum 2:\n$$ \\frac{c_2 N_{1,2}}{T_2} = \\frac{12 \\times 60}{300} = \\frac{720}{300} = 2.4 $$\nTotal denominator:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\frac{c_i N_{1,i}}{T_i} = 7.2 + 2.4 = 9.6 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the Mantel-Haenszel adjusted Relative Risk:\n$$ RR_{MH} = \\frac{50.4}{9.6} = 5.25 $$\nThe problem requests the result rounded to three significant figures. The value $5.25$ already has three significant figures.\n\nTo comment on the robustness of the pooled estimate and the likelihood of effect modification, we compute the stratum-specific Relative Risks ($RR_i$).\nThe risk is defined as cases divided by total individuals.\n$RR_i = \\frac{\\text{Risk in exposed}}{\\text{Risk in unexposed}} = \\frac{a_i/N_{1,i}}{c_i/N_{0,i}}$\n\nFor stratum 1 (Lower SES):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{1,1} = \\frac{a_1}{N_{1,1}} = \\frac{90}{180} = 0.5$\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{0,1} = \\frac{c_1}{N_{0,1}} = \\frac{12}{120} = 0.1$\n- Stratum-specific RR: $RR_1 = \\frac{R_{1,1}}{R_{0,1}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.1} = 5.0$\n\nFor stratum 2 (Higher SES):\n- Risk in exposed: $R_{1,2} = \\frac{a_2}{N_{1,2}} = \\frac{18}{60} = 0.3$\n- Risk in unexposed: $R_{0,2} = \\frac{c_2}{N_{0,2}} = \\frac{12}{240} = 0.05$\n- Stratum-specific RR: $RR_2 = \\frac{R_{1,2}}{R_{0,2}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.05} = 6.0$\n\nThe stratum-specific RRs are $RR_1 = 5.0$ and $RR_2 = 6.0$.\nEffect modification (or interaction) is present when the measure of effect (here, the RR) differs across strata of a third variable (here, SES). The RRs are not identical ($5.0$ versus $6.0$), which suggests some degree of effect modification. The effect of the Broad Street pump water appears slightly stronger in the higher SES stratum. However, this difference is modest. Without a formal statistical test for homogeneity (such as a Breslow-Day test adapted for RRs), we can only make a qualitative judgment. Given that the values are reasonably close, it is often considered acceptable to present a single, pooled estimate.\n\nThe adjusted estimate, $RR_{MH} = 5.25$, lies between the two stratum-specific RRs ($5.0$ and $6.0$). This is a required property of the Mantel-Haenszel estimator, which is a weighted average. Because the stratum-specific RRs are not drastically different, the pooled estimate of $5.25$ can be considered a robust summary measure of the association between drinking from the Broad Street pump and cholera, after adjusting for SES as a confounder.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the adjusted RR.",

The problem is self-contained, consistent, and feasible.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to estimate the causal effect of removing the Broad Street pump handle on cholera incidence. A simple and common estimand for such a pre-post study design is the ratio of the average daily incidence in the post-intervention period to that in the pre-intervention period. Let $I_{pre}$ and $I_{post}$ be the average daily incidence rates for the respective periods. The estimand is the ratio $R = \\frac{I_{post}}{I_{pre}}$.\n\nGiven that the problem states the population at risk remained stable, the daily case count $C_t$ is directly proportional to the daily incidence rate. Therefore, the ratio of average daily case counts can be used as a valid proxy for the ratio of average daily incidence rates. Let $\\bar{C}_{pre}$ and $\\bar{C}_{post}$ be the average daily case counts. The estimand is then calculated as $R = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{post}}{\\bar{C}_{pre}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average daily case count for the pre-intervention period, which spans $7$ days from $t=-7$ to $t=-1$.\nThe total number of cases in the pre-period is:\n$$ \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = C_{-7} + C_{-6} + C_{-5} + C_{-4} + C_{-3} + C_{-2} + C_{-1} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = 3 + 5 + 12 + 28 + 45 + 52 + 40 = 185 $$\nThe average daily case count over these $7$ days is:\n$$ \\bar{C}_{pre} = \\frac{1}{7} \\sum_{t=-7}^{-1} C_t = \\frac{185}{7} $$\n\nNext, we must define the post-intervention period. A naive approach would be to use all available post-removal data, from $t=+1$ to $t=+7$. The total cases in this naive post-period are:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{7} C_t = 38 + 30 + 20 + 12 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 116 $$\nThe naive average daily case count over these $7$ days is:\n$$ \\bar{C}_{post, naive} = \\frac{1}{7} \\sum_{t=1}^{7} C_t = \\frac{116}{7} $$\nThe naive ratio would be $R_{naive} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{post, naive}}{\\bar{C}_{pre}} = \\frac{116/7}{185/7} = \\frac{116}{185} \\approx 0.6270$.\n\nHowever, this naive approach is flawed because it ignores the disease's incubation period. The incubation period is the time delay between exposure to a pathogen and the onset of symptoms. For cholera, with a median incubation lag of $L=2$ days, a person who becomes a case on day $t_{case}$ was most likely infected on or around day $t_{infection} = t_{case} - L = t_{case} - 2$. The intervention—removal of the pump handle at $t=0$—stopped new exposures from this source. Therefore, cases observed shortly after $t=0$ are attributable to infections that occurred *before* the intervention. Specifically:\n-   Cases on day $t=+1$ likely resulted from infections around $t = +1 - 2 = -1$.\n-   Cases on day $t=+2$ likely resulted from infections around $t = +2 - 2 = 0$.\n\nSince these cases arise from pre-intervention or peri-intervention exposures, they do not reflect the effect of the intervention itself (the absence of contaminated water). To properly estimate the intervention's effect, we must analyze a post-intervention period where the observed cases correspond to a time window of infection that is fully post-intervention. A case observed on day $t=+3$ corresponds to an infection around day $t=+1$, which is after the pump was disabled. Therefore, to isolate the effect, the analysis of the post-intervention period should begin after the incubation lag has passed.\n\nAs specified, we use the lag-adjusted post-intervention period from $t=+3$ to $t=+7$. This period includes $5$ days. We calculate the average daily case count for this adjusted period, $\\bar{C}_{post, adj}$.\nThe total number of cases in the lag-adjusted post-period is:\n$$ \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = C_{+3} + C_{+4} + C_{+5} + C_{+6} + C_{+7} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = 20 + 12 + 8 + 5 + 3 = 48 $$\nThe average daily case count over these $5$ days is:\n$$ \\bar{C}_{post, adj} = \\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{t=3}^{7} C_t = \\frac{48}{5} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the lag-adjusted post–pre ratio, $R_{adj}$, which is the required final quantity.\n$$ R_{adj} = \\frac{\\bar{C}_{post, adj}}{\\bar{C}_{pre}} = \\frac{48/5}{185/7} $$\n$$ R_{adj} = \\frac{48 \\times 7}{5 \\times 185} = \\frac{336}{925} $$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we perform the division and round to four significant figures.\n$$ R_{adj} \\approx 0.36324324... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.3632$. This value, which is substantially lower than the naive estimate, indicates a more pronounced reduction in cholera incidence following the removal of the pump handle, correctly accounted for by the biological reality of the incubation period.",
