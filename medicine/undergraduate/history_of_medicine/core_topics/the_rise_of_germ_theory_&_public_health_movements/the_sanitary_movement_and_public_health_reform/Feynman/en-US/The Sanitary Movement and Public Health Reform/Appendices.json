            "problem": "William Farr, a leading figure in the nineteenth-century sanitary movement, emphasized the need to compare mortality experiences of districts after removing the confounding effect of different age structures. Consider three age bands indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$: ages $0$–$14$, $15$–$64$, and $\\geq 65$. Let a district $j$ have age-specific mortality rates $r_{ij}$ given in deaths per $K$ persons (with $K=1000$). A chosen standard population has age-band counts $S_i$ and total size $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i$. From the definitional base that a mortality rate for age band $i$ is deaths divided by population exposed, and that comparability requires applying district-specific age-specific rates to a common standard population composition, derive an expression for the Direct Age-Standardized Rate (DASR) for district $j$ in terms of $r_{ij}$, $S_i$, and $S$.\n\nThen, illustrate Farr’s method using the following hypothetical data:\n- Standard population counts: $S_1 = 28000$, $S_2 = 62000$, $S_3 = 10000$ (so $S=100000$).\n- District A age-specific mortality rates per $1000$: $r_{1A} = 2.5$, $r_{2A} = 6.0$, $r_{3A} = 45.0$.\n- District B age-specific mortality rates per $1000$: $r_{1B} = 3.0$, $r_{2B} = 5.5$, $r_{3B} = 40.0$.\n\nCompute the Standardized Rate Ratio (SRR), defined as $\\mathrm{SRR} = \\mathrm{DASR}_A / \\mathrm{DASR}_B$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nThe task is twofold: first, to derive a general expression for the Direct Age-Standardized Rate (DASR) for a district $j$, and second, to apply this to compute the Standardized Rate Ratio (SRR) for two specific districts, A and B.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Direct Age-Standardized Rate (DASR)**\n\nThe goal of direct age standardization is to determine the overall mortality rate that a district would have if its population had the same age structure as a \"standard\" population. This allows for a fair comparison of mortality between districts, free from the confounding effect of differing age distributions.\n\nLet $i$ be the index for the age band, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nLet $j$ be the index for the district.\nThe age-specific mortality rate for age band $i$ in district $j$ is given as $r_{ij}$, expressed in deaths per $K$ persons, where $K=1000$. This means that the mortality rate as a simple proportion, let's call it $m_{ij}$, is given by $m_{ij} = \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}$.\n\nThe standard population has a known count of individuals, $S_i$, in each age band $i$. The total size of the standard population is $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i$.\n\nTo find the DASR for district $j$, we calculate the total number of deaths that would be *expected* to occur in the standard population if it were subject to the age-specific mortality rates of district $j$.\n\nThe number of expected deaths in age band $i$, denoted $E_{ij}$, is the product of the number of people in that age band in the standard population ($S_i$) and the age-specific mortality proportion for district $j$ ($m_{ij}$):\n$$E_{ij} = S_i \\times m_{ij} = S_i \\times \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}$$\n\nThe total number of expected deaths for district $j$, denoted $E_j$, is the sum of the expected deaths across all age bands:\n$$E_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} E_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(S_i \\times \\frac{r_{ij}}{K}\\right) = \\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}$$\n\nThe DASR is the total number of expected deaths per person in the standard population, typically scaled to be expressed per $K$ persons to maintain consistency with the input rates.\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{E_j}{S} \\times K$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_j$:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}}{S} \\times K$$\nThe factors of $K$ cancel, yielding the general expression for the DASR for district $j$:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} S_i r_{ij}}{S}$$\nThis can also be expressed as a weighted average of the age-specific rates, where the weights $w_i = \\frac{S_i}{S}$ are the proportions of the standard population in each age band:\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\left(\\frac{S_i}{S}\\right) r_{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i r_{ij}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for Districts A and B**\n\nWe are given the following data:\nStandard population counts: $S_1 = 28000$, $S_2 = 62000$, $S_3 = 10000$.\nTotal standard population: $S = 28000 + 62000 + 10000 = 100000$.\nThe rates are per $K=1000$ persons.\n\nDistrict A rates: $r_{1A} = 2.5$, $r_{2A} = 6.0$, $r_{3A} = 45.0$.\nDistrict B rates: $r_{1B} = 3.0$, $r_{2B} = 5.5$, $r_{3B} = 40.0$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the DASR for District A ($\\mathrm{DASR}_A$):\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{S_1 r_{1A} + S_2 r_{2A} + S_3 r_{3A}}{S}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{(28000 \\times 2.5) + (62000 \\times 6.0) + (10000 \\times 45.0)}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{70000 + 372000 + 450000}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_A = \\frac{892000}{100000} = 8.92$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{DASR}_A$ are deaths per $1000$ persons.\n\nNext, we calculate the DASR for District B ($\\mathrm{DASR}_B$):\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{S_1 r_{1B} + S_2 r_{2B} + S_3 r_{3B}}{S}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{(28000 \\times 3.0) + (62000 \\times 5.5) + (10000 \\times 40.0)}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{84000 + 341000 + 400000}{100000}$$\n$$\\mathrm{DASR}_B = \\frac{825000}{100000} = 8.25$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{DASR}_B$ are also deaths per $1000$ persons.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Standardized Rate Ratio (SRR)**\n\nThe SRR is defined as the ratio of the two standardized rates:\n$$\\mathrm{SRR} = \\frac{\\mathrm{DASR}_A}{\\mathrm{DASR}_B}$$\n$$\\mathrm{SRR} = \\frac{8.92}{8.25} \\approx 1.08121212...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to four significant figures.

            "problem": "In a mid-nineteenth-century city implementing sewerage as part of the Sanitary Movement, public health officials recorded cholera counts and populations in three wards during a single outbreak. Some blocks were sewered, others were not. The historical question is whether sewer coverage reduced cholera risk, and how aggregation across wards might mislead interpretation. You are given the following ward-level data, where the cholera incidence rate in any stratum is defined as the ratio of cholera cases to the population in that stratum:\n\nWard $1$ (high baseline risk):\n- Sewered: $N_{1,S} = 3000$ residents, $C_{1,S} = 270$ cholera cases.\n- Non-sewered: $N_{1,\\neg S} = 1000$ residents, $C_{1,\\neg S} = 120$ cholera cases.\n\nWard $2$ (moderate baseline risk):\n- Sewered: $N_{2,S} = 2000$ residents, $C_{2,S} = 80$ cholera cases.\n- Non-sewered: $N_{2,\\neg S} = 3000$ residents, $C_{2,\\neg S} = 180$ cholera cases.\n\nWard $3$ (low baseline risk):\n- Sewered: $N_{3,S} = 500$ residents, $C_{3,S} = 5$ cholera cases.\n- Non-sewered: $N_{3,\\neg S} = 4000$ residents, $C_{3,\\neg S} = 80$ cholera cases.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions—incidence rate $I = C/N$ and conditional probability $P(D|\\cdot)$ (with $D$ denoting cholera), and without invoking any shortcut formulas—do the following conceptually and numerically:\n\n1. Compute the overall aggregated cholera incidence among sewered residents, $I_{S}$, and among non-sewered residents, $I_{\\neg S}$, by pooling across all wards. Interpret whether aggregation suggests that sewer coverage increases or decreases cholera risk.\n\n2.

Reconcile any apparent contradiction between the aggregated comparison and the ward-stratified comparisons by appropriate conditioning. Specifically, explain how Simpson’s paradox can arise from differences in the distribution of ward membership between sewered and non-sewered residents, and resolve it by conditioning on ward (and, equivalently, by direct standardization to a common ward distribution). Then compute the direct standardized incidence for sewered and non-sewered residents using the city’s combined ward distribution as the standard, that is, weights $w_{1} = N_{1}/N$, $w_{2} = N_{2}/N$, $w_{3} = N_{3}/N$, where $N_{w} = N_{w,S} + N_{w,\\neg S}$ and $N = \\sum_{w} N_{w}$.\n\nWhich option below correctly reports the aggregated and stratified findings, identifies the source of Simpson’s paradox in this context, and provides the correct standardized incidences with the proper interpretation?\n\nA. Aggregation shows that sewered residents have a lower cholera incidence than non-sewered residents, so sewers are uniformly protective; stratification is unnecessary.\n\nB. Aggregation misleadingly shows higher cholera incidence among sewered residents, but stratification by ward reveals lower incidence among sewered residents in every ward; the paradox arises because sewered residents are disproportionately in the highest-risk ward. Direct standardization to the city’s combined ward distribution yields a standardized sewered incidence of approximately $0.0448$ and a standardized non-sewered incidence of approximately $0.0644$, correctly indicating a protective effect of sewers.\n\nC. Simpson’s paradox is caused by using incidence per $100$ residents rather than per $1000$, and unit conversion alone resolves the contradiction without stratification; standardized incidences for sewered and non-sewered residents are equal.\n\nD. Conditioning on ward does not change the conclusion because sewer placement was random; aggregated differences are causal and persist after standardization, showing sewers increased cholera risk.",
            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in epidemiology and statistics that requires an analysis of Simpson's paradox.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data provided for a single cholera outbreak across three city wards are as follows:\n\nWard $1$ (high baseline risk):\n- Sewered block: Population $N_{1,S} = 3000$, Cholera cases $C_{1,S} = 270$.\n- Non-sewered block: Population $N_{1,\\neg S} = 1000$, Cholera cases $C_{1,\\neg S} = 120$.\n\nWard $2$ (moderate baseline risk):\n- Sewered block: Population $N_{2,S} = 2000$, Cholera cases $C_{2,S} = 80$.\n- Non-sewered block: Population $N_{2,\\neg S} = 3000$, Cholera cases $C_{2,\\neg S} = 180$.\n\nWard $3$ (low baseline risk):\n- Sewered block: Population $N_{3,S} = 500$, Cholera cases $C_{3,S} = 5$.\n- Non-sewered block: Population $N_{3,\\neg S} = 4000$, Cholera cases $C_{3,\\neg S} = 80$.\n\nDefinitions:\n- Cholera incidence rate: $I = C/N$, where $C$ is the number of cases and $N$ is the population.\n- The task requires computing aggregated incidences, stratified incidences, explaining the paradox, and performing direct standardization using a specific weighting scheme.\n- Standardization weights are defined as $w_{i} = N_{i}/N$, where $N_i = N_{i,S} + N_{i, \\neg S}$ is the total population of ward $i$, and $N = \\sum_i N_i$ is the total city population.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic, formalizable scenario for demonstrating Simpson's paradox, a fundamental concept in statistics and epidemiology. The data are self-contained and consistent, with no missing information or contradictions. The numbers, while representing a severe historical outbreak, are not physically or mathematically impossible. The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for three distinct calculations and interpretations.\n\n**1. Aggregated Cholera Incidence**\n\nFirst, we pool the data across all three wards to compute the overall incidence rates for sewered and non-sewered populations.\n\nThe total population of sewered residents is:\n$$N_S = N_{1,S} + N_{2,S} + N_{3,S} = 3000 + 2000 + 500 = 5500$$\nThe total number of cholera cases among sewered residents is:\n$$C_S = C_{1,S} + C_{2,S} + C_{3,S} = 270 + 80 + 5 = 355$$\nThe aggregated cholera incidence among sewered residents is:\n$$I_S = \\frac{C_S}{N_S} = \\frac{355}{5500} = \\frac{71}{1100} \\approx 0.0645$$\n\nThe total population of non-sewered residents is:\n$$N_{\\neg S} = N_{1,\\neg S} + N_{2,\\neg S} + N_{3,\\neg S} = 1000 + 3000 + 4000 = 8000$$\nThe total number of cholera cases among non-sewered residents is:\n$$C_{\\neg S} = C_{1,\\neg S} + C_{2,\\neg S} + C_{3,\\neg S} = 120 + 180 + 80 = 380$$\nThe aggregated cholera incidence among non-sewered residents is:\n$$I_{\\neg S} = \\frac{C_{\\neg S}}{N_{\\neg S}} = \\frac{380}{8000} = \\frac{19}{400} = 0.0475$$\n\n**Interpretation of Aggregated Data:**\nComparing the two rates, we find $I_S \\approx 0.0645 > I_{\\neg S} = 0.0475$. The aggregated data misleadingly suggest that having a sewer connection is associated with a *higher* risk of cholera.\n\n**2. Ward-Stratified Incidences**\n\nNext, we compute the incidence rates within each ward (stratum).\n\n**Ward 1:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=1} = \\frac{C_{1,S}}{N_{1,S}} = \\frac{270}{3000} = 0.09$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=1} = \\frac{C_{1,\\neg S}}{N_{1,\\neg S}} = \\frac{120}{1000} = 0.12$.\n- In Ward $1$, $I_{S|W=1} < I_{\\neg S|W=1}$.\n\n**Ward 2:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=2} = \\frac{C_{2,S}}{N_{2,S}} = \\frac{80}{2000} = 0.04$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=2} = \\frac{C_{2,\\neg S}}{N_{2,\\neg S}} = \\frac{180}{3000} = 0.06$.\n- In Ward $2$, $I_{S|W=2} < I_{\\neg S|W=2}$.\n\n**Ward 3:**\n- Sewered incidence: $I_{S|W=3} = \\frac{C_{3,S}}{N_{3,S}} = \\frac{5}{500} = 0.01$.\n- Non-sewered incidence: $I_{\\neg S|W=3} = \\frac{C_{3,\\neg S}}{N_{3,\\neg S}} = \\frac{80}{4000} = 0.02$.\n- In Ward $3$, $I_{S|W=3} < I_{\\neg S|W=3}$.\n\n**Interpretation of Stratified Data:**\nIn every single ward, the cholera incidence is lower for sewered residents than for non-sewered residents. This directly contradicts the conclusion from the aggregated data. This reversal of association is the defining characteristic of Simpson's paradox.\n\n**3. Reconciliation via Conditioning and Standardization**\n\nThe paradox arises because the confounding variable—ward membership, which serves as a proxy for baseline risk—is correlated with both the exposure (sewerage) and the outcome (cholera). Specifically, the distribution of the population across wards is different for the sewered and non-sewered groups.\n\nLet's examine the distributions:\n- Proportion of sewered residents in high-risk Ward 1: $3000/5500 \\approx 54.5\\%$.\n- Proportion of sewered residents in low-risk Ward 3: $500/5500 \\approx 9.1\\%$.\n- Proportion of non-sewered residents in high-risk Ward 1: $1000/8000 = 12.5\\%$.\n- Proportion of non-sewered residents in low-risk Ward 3: $4000/8000 = 50\\%$.\n\nThe sewered population is concentrated in the highest-risk ward, while the non-sewered population is concentrated in the lowest-risk ward. The aggregated rate for the sewered group is thus inflated by the high baseline risk of Ward $1$, while the aggregated rate for the non-sewered group is deflated by the low baseline risk of Ward $3$.\n\nTo resolve this, we perform direct standardization, creating adjusted incidence rates by applying the stratum-specific rates to a standard population distribution. The problem specifies using the city's overall ward distribution as the standard.\n\nFirst, calculate the standard weights ($w_i$):\n- Total population of Ward 1: $N_1 = 3000 + 1000 = 4000$.\n- Total population of Ward 2: $N_2 = 2000 + 3000 = 5000$.\n- Total population of Ward 3: $N_3 = 500 + 4000 = 4500$.\n- Total city population: $N = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 4000 + 5000 + 4500 = 13500$.\n- Standard weights:\n  - $w_1 = N_1/N = 4000/13500 = 8/27$.\n  - $w_2 = N_2/N = 5000/13500 = 10/27$.\n  - $w_3 = N_3/N = 4500/13500 = 9/27$.\n\nNow, compute the standardized incidences ($I_{std}$) by taking the weighted average of the stratum-specific rates.\n\nStandardized incidence for sewered residents:\n$$I_{S, std} = \\sum_{w=1}^3 w_w I_{S|W=w} = w_1 I_{S|W=1} + w_2 I_{S|W=2} + w_3 I_{S|W=3}$$\n$$I_{S, std} = \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) (0.09) + \\left(\\frac{10}{27}\\right) (0.04) + \\left(\\frac{9}{27}\\right) (0.01)$$\n$$I_{S, std} = \\frac{1}{27} (8 \\times 0.09 + 10 \\times 0.04 + 9 \\times 0.01) = \\frac{1}{27} (0.72 + 0.40 + 0.09) = \\frac{1.21}{27} \\approx 0.04481$$\n\nStandardized incidence for non-sewered residents:\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\sum_{w=1}^3 w_w I_{\\neg S|W=w} = w_1 I_{\\neg S|W=1} + w_2 I_{\\neg S|W=2} + w_3 I_{\\neg S|W=3}$$\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\left(\\frac{8}{27}\\right) (0.12) + \\left(\\frac{10}{27}\\right) (0.06) + \\left(\\frac{9}{27}\\right) (0.02)$$\n$$I_{\\neg S, std} = \\frac{1}{27} (8 \\times 0.12 + 10 \\times 0.06 + 9 \\times 0.02) = \\frac{1}{27} (0.96 + 0.60 + 0.18) = \\frac{1.74}{27} \\approx 0.06444$$\n\n**Interpretation of Standardized Data:**\nAfter adjusting for the confounding effect of ward distribution, the standardized incidence for sewered residents ($I_{S, std} \\approx 0.0448$) is clearly lower than that for non-sewered residents ($I_{\\neg S, std} \\approx 0.0644$). This confirms the finding from the stratified analysis: sewers have a protective effect.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Aggregation shows that sewered residents have a lower cholera incidence than non-sewered residents, so sewers are uniformly protective; stratification is unnecessary.**\nThis is factually incorrect. The aggregated incidence for sewered residents ($I_S \\approx 0.0645$) is higher than for non-sewered residents ($I_{\\neg S} = 0.0475$). Furthermore, the claim that stratification is unnecessary is a misunderstanding of confounding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Aggregation misleadingly shows higher cholera incidence among sewered residents, but stratification by ward reveals lower incidence among sewered residents in every ward; the paradox arises because sewered residents are disproportionately in the highest-risk ward. Direct standardization to the city’s combined ward distribution yields a standardized sewered incidence of approximately $0.0448$ and a standardized non-sewered incidence of approximately $0.0644$, correctly indicating a protective effect of sewers.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the results of the derivation. It correctly identifies the direction of the aggregated relationship ($I_S > I_{\\neg S}$), the direction of the stratified relationship ($I_{S|W} < I_{\\neg S|W}$ for all wards), the correct mechanism for the paradox (confounding by ward risk), and the correct numerical results for direct standardization ($I_{S, std} \\approx 0.0448$ and $I_{\\neg S, std} \\approx 0.0644$), along with the correct final interpretation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Simpson’s paradox is caused by using incidence per $100$ residents rather than per $1000$, and unit conversion alone resolves the contradiction without stratification; standardized incidences for sewered and non-sewered residents are equal.**\nThis is conceptually flawed. Changing the units of an incidence rate (e.g., from per capita to per $1000$) is a simple multiplicative scaling that does not alter the direction of an inequality and cannot resolve Simpson's paradox. The claim that standardized incidences are equal is also numerically false, as shown by the calculations.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Conditioning on ward does not change the conclusion because sewer placement was random; aggregated differences are causal and persist after standardization, showing sewers increased cholera risk.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. Conditioning on ward fundamentally *reverses* the conclusion. Sewer placement was demonstrably non-random, as shown by the unequal distributions. The aggregated differences are not causal but are artifacts of confounding, and the standardized results show a protective effect, not an increased risk.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The present value of this annuity is the sum of the present values of each individual net cash flow:\n$$ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{B-M}{(1+r)^t} $$\nWe can factor out the constant term $(B-M)$:\n$$ PV_{\\text{annuity}} = (B-M) \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} = (B-M) \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t $$\nThe summation is a finite geometric series with $n$ terms, a first term of $a = \\frac{1}{1+r}$, and a common ratio of $q = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The sum of such a series is given by the formula $S_n = a \\frac{1-q^n}{1-q}$. Substituting our terms for $a$ and $q$:\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^n}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{\\frac{1+r-1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\cdot \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} $$\n$$ \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} $$\nThis expression is the present value interest factor for an annuity (PVIFA).\n\nThe total NPV of the project is the sum of the present value of the initial outlay and the present value of the annuity:\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV} = -K + (B-M) \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} \\right] $$\nThis is the required general derivation of the NPV for the project.\n\nNow, we evaluate the NPV for the two given discount rates using the provided values: $K = 80$ million, $B = 6.5$ million, $M = 1.8$ million, and $n = 30$ years. The net annual benefit is $B-M = 6.5 - 1.8 = 4.7$ million. All calculations will be performed in millions of USD.\n\nCase 1: $r = 0.03$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+0.03)^{-30}}{0.03} \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.03)^{-30}}{0.03} \\right] $$\nFirst, we compute $(1.03)^{-30} \\approx 0.41198676$.\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) \\approx -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - 0.41198676}{0.03} \\right] = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{0.58801324}{0.03} \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) \\approx -80 + (4.7)(19.60044135) \\approx -80 + 92.12207435 \\approx 12.12207435 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) > 0$, the project's expected benefits outweigh its costs in present value terms. Therefore, at a discount rate of $3\\%$, the project would be undertaken.\n\nCase 2: $r = 0.07$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.07) = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+0.07)^{-30}}{0.07} \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.07) = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1.07)^{-30}}{0.07} \\right] $$\nFirst, we compute $(1.07)^{-30} \\approx 0.13136733$.\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.07) \\approx -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{1 - 0.13136733}{0.07} \\right] = -80 + (4.7) \\left[ \\frac{0.86863267}{0.07} \\right] $$\n$$ \\mathrm{NPV}(0.07) \\approx -80 + (4.7)(12.40903813) \\approx -80 + 58.32247921 \\approx -21.67752079 $$\nSince $\\mathrm{NPV}(0.07) < 0$, the project's costs outweigh its benefits in present value terms. A higher discount rate diminishes the present value of future benefits more severely. At a discount rate of $7\\%$, the project would not be undertaken.\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta = \\mathrm{NPV}(0.03) - \\mathrm{NPV}(0.07)$:\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 12.12207435 - (-21.67752079) $$\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 12.12207435 + 21.67752079 = 33.79959514 $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 33.80 $$\nThe result is in units of million United States dollars.",
