            "introduction": "The Enlightenment's passion for reason found a powerful outlet in \"political arithmetic\"—the use of statistics to govern and understand the state. To truly compare the health of different communities, however, early demographers had to learn that raw numbers can deceive. This practice guides you through the crucial insight of age-standardization, a technique developed to correct for confounding variables and make fair comparisons of mortality rates, laying a cornerstone for modern epidemiology.

            "problem": "In the late eighteenth century, quantitative demography emerging from the Bills of Mortality exemplified the Enlightenment’s drive to measure and compare. Consider two English parishes, $A$ and $B$, whose crude mortality rates are reported as $C_A = 50$ deaths per $1{,}000$ and $C_B = 60$ deaths per $1{,}000$. Each parish’s population is partitioned into two age groups: young ($Y$) and elderly ($E$). Parish $B$ has twice the proportion of elderly as parish $A$. Contemporary observations indicate that the age-specific mortality rate among the elderly is $3$ times the age-specific mortality rate among the young, and that the age-specific rates are approximately the same in both parishes owing to similar living conditions.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions that a crude rate is the number of events divided by the total population, that age-specific rates are events divided by population within age categories, and that a crude rate over categories equals a weighted mean of category-specific rates with category proportions as weights, do the following:\n\n1) Derive from first principles an expression for a directly age-standardized mortality rate using an arbitrary fixed standard age distribution, and explain why choosing a common set of weights is necessary to achieve comparability when age compositions differ.\n\n2) Using the given data and the constraint that the elderly rate is $3$ times the young rate, determine the elderly proportion in parish $A$ and the consistent age-specific mortality rates for $Y$ and $E$.\n\n3) Let the standard age distribution be the average of the two parishes’ age compositions. Compute the directly age-standardized mortality rate (common value) under this standard distribution. Express your final answer in deaths per $1{,}000$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of demography and epidemiology, self-contained, and mathematically well-posed, providing sufficient information to determine a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: a theoretical derivation of direct standardization, the calculation of specific demographic parameters from the given data, and the computation of a standardized mortality rate.\n\n1) Derivation of the Age-Standardized Rate and Rationale for Its Use\n\nLet a population $i$ be partitioned into $j$ age groups. Let $P_{ij}$ be the population count in age group $j$ of population $i$, and let $D_{ij}$ be the number of deaths in that same subgroup. The total population is $P_i = \\sum_j P_{ij}$ and the total number of deaths is $D_i = \\sum_j D_{ij}$.\n\nThe age-specific mortality rate for group $j$ in population $i$ is defined as:\n$$m_{ij} = \\frac{D_{ij}}{P_{ij}}$$\nThe crude mortality rate for population $i$ is defined as the total number of deaths divided by the total population:\n$$C_i = \\frac{D_i}{P_i} = \\frac{\\sum_j D_{ij}}{\\sum_j P_{ij}}$$\nBy substituting $D_{ij} = m_{ij} P_{ij}$, we can express the crude rate as:\n$$C_i = \\frac{\\sum_j m_{ij} P_{ij}}{P_i}$$\nLet $p_{ij} = \\frac{P_{ij}}{P_i}$ be the proportion of the total population of $i$ that belongs to age group $j$. The set of proportions $\\{p_{i1}, p_{i2}, \\dots\\}$ represents the age composition of population $i$, with $\\sum_j p_{ij} = 1$. The crude rate can then be written as a weighted mean of the age-specific mortality rates:\n$$C_i = \\sum_j m_{ij} \\left(\\frac{P_{ij}}{P_i}\\right) = \\sum_j m_{ij} p_{ij}$$\nIn the given problem, the age-specific rates are the same in both parishes, so $m_{Aj} = m_{Bj} = m_j$. Therefore, the crude rates are $C_A = \\sum_j m_j p_{Aj}$ and $C_B = \\sum_j m_j p_{Bj}$. The observed difference between $C_A$ and $C_B$ does not arise from a difference in the underlying mortality risks ($m_j$), but from the difference in the age compositions ($p_{Aj}$ vs. $p_{Bj}$). This illustrates the principle of confounding, where the effect of age structure obscures the comparison of intrinsic mortality.\n\nTo achieve a fair comparison, a method of direct age-standardization is employed. This method calculates what the overall mortality rate would be in each population if they both had the same, common age structure, referred to as a \"standard population\". Let the age composition of this standard population be given by a set of weights $\\{w_1, w_2, \\dots\\}$, where $w_j$ is the proportion of the standard population in age group $j$ and $\\sum_j w_j = 1$.\n\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) for population $i$ is derived by applying these standard weights to population $i$'s age-specific mortality rates:\n$$ASMR_i = \\sum_j m_{ij} w_j$$\nThis expression provides a mortality rate that is adjusted for age, allowing for a comparison between populations free from the confounding effect of differing age compositions. Choosing a common set of weights $\\{w_j\\}$ is necessary because it establishes a common baseline for comparison, thereby isolating the true differences in age-specific mortality rates ($m_{ij}$) as the sole source of any remaining variation in the standardized rates.\n\n2) Determination of Age Proportions and Age-Specific Mortality Rates\n\nThe population is partitioned into two groups: young ($Y$) and elderly ($E$). Let $p_A$ and $p_B$ be the proportions of the elderly population in parishes $A$ and $B$, respectively. The proportions of the young population are then ($1-p_A$) and ($1-p_B$). Let $m_Y$ and $m_E$ be the age-specific mortality rates for the young and elderly, respectively, assumed to be the same for both parishes.\n\nThe givens are:\n- Crude mortality rate for parish $A$: $C_A = 50$ per $1{,}000$, or $0.050$.\n- Crude mortality rate for parish $B$: $C_B = 60$ per $1{,}000$, or $0.060$.\n- Relation of elderly proportions: $p_B = 2p_A$.\n- Relation of age-specific rates: $m_E = 3m_Y$.\n\nUsing the formula for the crude rate as a weighted average:\nFor parish $A$: $C_A = m_Y(1-p_A) + m_E p_A = 0.050$\nFor parish $B$: $C_B = m_Y(1-p_B) + m_E p_B = 0.060$\n\nSubstitute $m_E = 3m_Y$ into the equations:\n$0.050 = m_Y(1-p_A) + (3m_Y)p_A = m_Y(1 - p_A + 3p_A) = m_Y(1+2p_A)$\n$0.060 = m_Y(1-p_B) + (3m_Y)p_B = m_Y(1 - p_B + 3p_B) = m_Y(1+2p_B)$\n\nNow substitute $p_B = 2p_A$ into the second equation:\n$0.060 = m_Y(1 + 2(2p_A)) = m_Y(1+4p_A)$\n\nWe have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $p_A$ and $m_Y$:\n1) $0.050 = m_Y(1+2p_A)$\n2) $0.060 = m_Y(1+4p_A)$\n\nTo solve, we take the ratio of equation (2) to equation (1) to eliminate $m_Y$:\n$$\\frac{0.060}{0.050} = \\frac{m_Y(1+4p_A)}{m_Y(1+2p_A)}$$\n$$\\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{1+4p_A}{1+2p_A}$$\n$$6(1+2p_A) = 5(1+4p_A)$$\n$$6 + 12p_A = 5 + 20p_A$$\n$$1 = 8p_A$$\n$$p_A = \\frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$\nThe elderly proportion in parish $A$ is $\\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nNow, substitute $p_A = \\frac{1}{8}$ back into equation (1) to find $m_Y$:\n$$0.050 = m_Y\\left(1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)\\right) = m_Y\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = m_Y\\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)$$\n$$m_Y = 0.050 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 0.040$$\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the young is $m_Y = 0.040$, or $40$ deaths per $1{,}000$.\n\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the elderly is:\n$$m_E = 3m_Y = 3 \\times 0.040 = 0.120$$\nThe age-specific mortality rate for the elderly is $m_E = 0.120$, or $120$ deaths per $1{,}000$.\n\n3) Computation of the Directly Age-Standardized Mortality Rate\n\nThe standard age distribution is the average of the two parishes' age compositions.\nFirst, determine the age composition of both parishes:\nParish $A$:\n- Elderly proportion: $p_A = \\frac{1}{8}$\n- Young proportion: $1-p_A = \\frac{7}{8}$\nParish $B$:\n- Elderly proportion: $p_B = 2p_A = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$\n- Young proportion: $1-p_B = \\frac{3}{4}$\n\nThe standard weights, $w_Y$ and $w_E$, are the averages of these proportions:\n$$w_Y = \\frac{(1-p_A) + (1-p_B)}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{3}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{8} + \\frac{6}{8}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{13}{8}}{2} = \\frac{13}{16}$$\n$$w_E = \\frac{p_A + p_B}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{8}}{2} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{8}}{2} = \\frac{3}{16}$$\n(As a check, $w_Y + w_E = \\frac{13}{16} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$).\n\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) is calculated using these standard weights and the derived age-specific mortality rates, $m_Y = 0.040$ and $m_E = 0.120$. Since the age-specific rates are the same for both parishes, the ASMR will be a single common value.\n$$ASMR = m_Y w_Y + m_E w_E$$\n$$ASMR = (0.040)\\left(\\frac{13}{16}\\right) + (0.120)\\left(\\frac{3}{16}\\right)$$\n$$ASMR = \\frac{0.040 \\times 13 + 0.120 \\times 3}{16} = \\frac{0.520 + 0.360}{16} = \\frac{0.880}{16}$$\n$$ASMR = 0.055$$\nTo express this value in deaths per $1{,}000$, we multiply by $1{,}000$:\n$$0.055 \\times 1000 = 55$$\nThe directly age-standardized mortality rate is $55$ deaths per $1{,}000$.",

This practice in nosology challenges you to construct a logical system for classifying diseases based on their observable signs. By weighing the discriminative power of different symptoms, you will engage in the fundamental process of defining diseases, a necessary prerequisite for studying their causes and testing potential cures. ",
            "id": "4768650",
            "problem": "You are a physician in the late eighteenth century influenced by the Linnaean ideal of classification by observable, stable characters, and by the Enlightenment emphasis on empirical regularity and probabilistic caution. You wish to construct a nosology that maximizes discriminative power (separating diseases by features that yield the greatest number of distinct, non-overlapping groups at each step) while minimizing false positives (avoiding assigning a case to a category when its distinguishing character is not specific). You have compiled the following symptom matrix for eruptive fevers commonly discussed by eighteenth-century nosologists such as François Boissier de Sauvages de Lacroix and William Cullen:\n\n- Variola (smallpox): fever intensity high; rash morphology vesicular; typical duration $14$–$21$ days.\n- Rubeola (measles): fever intensity high; rash morphology maculopapular; typical duration $7$–$10$ days.\n- Rubella (German measles): fever intensity low to moderate; rash morphology maculopapular; typical duration $3$–$5$ days.\n- Scarlatina (scarlet fever): fever intensity high; rash morphology scarlatiniform (diffuse fine erythema); typical duration $7$–$10$ days.\n- Typhus (spotted fever): fever intensity high; rash morphology petechial; typical duration $7$–$14$ days.\n\nAssume the following for the sake of classification: rash morphologies are as observed, durations are typical ranges but there is day-to-day variation within the listed ranges, and fever intensity is a categorical observation (high, moderate, low) rather than a temperature measurement. Using foundational Enlightenment commitments to classification by specific characters and empiricism, and using the core definitions of specificity (probability of correctly rejecting non-cases) and pathognomonic sign (a sign that is uniquely characteristic of a disease), which of the following hierarchical schemes best satisfies the dual aim of maximizing discriminative power at the top split and minimizing false positives across the tree?\n\nA. First split by rash morphology: vesicular, scarlatiniform, petechial, maculopapular. Classify vesicular as Variola, scarlatiniform as Scarlatina, petechial as Typhus. For maculopapular cases, split by duration: $3$–$5$ days as Rubella; $7$–$10$ days as Rubeola. Use fever intensity only as a tertiary tie-breaker if a case straddles duration boundaries. Rationale: prioritize the most specific, stable morphological characters to reduce false positives; then use duration to separate the two maculopapular diseases that overlap in rash but diverge in length.\n\nB. First split by fever intensity (high versus not high), then split by duration (greater than $10$ days versus $10$ days or fewer), and only then use rash morphology to refine. Rationale: fever is the most salient presenting feature; duration thresholds further sharpen categories before final morphological confirmation.\n\nC. Compute a weighted additive score for each disease using the three features (assign weights: fever intensity high $=2$, maculopapular rash $=1$, vesicular or petechial rash $=2$, duration greater than $10$ days $=2$, duration $7$–$10$ days $=1$, duration $3$–$5$ days $=1$), then classify a case to the disease with the highest score. Rationale: integrating multiple characters numerically yields a more balanced classification and reduces dependence on any single feature.\n\nD. Group diseases by presumed causes into inflammatory versus putrid classes first, then refine using overall fever severity and patient constitution, leaving rash morphology and duration to later corroboration. Rationale: humoral and miasmatic causes provide the most fundamental distinctions, with signs serving to support causal categories.\n\nSelect the single best option.",
            "solution": "This problem requires selecting the classification scheme that best reflects Enlightenment principles of empirical, hierarchical classification (nosology) as practiced by figures like Linnaeus and de Sauvages. The goal is to prioritize observable, stable characters that provide the most discriminative power.\n\n1.  **Analyze Discriminative Power of First Split:**\n    *   **Option A (Rash Morphology):** This is the strongest first split. Rash morphology is a highly specific observable sign. It immediately separates the diseases into four groups. Three of these groups contain only one disease (Vesicular → Variola; Scarlatiniform → Scarlatina; Petechial → Typhus), making these signs nearly pathognomonic within this set. This provides maximum initial discriminative power.\n    *   **Option B (Fever Intensity):** This is a weak first split. Four of the five diseases present with \"high\" fever intensity. This split would create one group of four diseases and one group of one (Rubella), offering very little initial discrimination.\n    *   **Option D (Presumed Causes):** This approach runs counter to the Enlightenment's empirical shift. It relies on theoretical, unobservable causes (\"inflammatory versus putrid classes\") rather than on direct observation of signs, which is the very method the new nosologists were trying to establish.\n    *   **Option C (Weighted Score):** This method of creating a numerical score is a more modern, holistic approach (related to clinical prediction rules) and does not reflect the hierarchical, branching-tree classification method favored by 18th-century nosologists attempting to mimic Linnaean botany.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Hierarchy:**\n    *   Option A follows a logical hierarchy. After the powerful initial split on morphology, it uses a secondary observable characteristic (duration) to resolve the remaining ambiguity in the \"maculopapular\" group, correctly separating Rubeola (longer duration) from Rubella (shorter duration). This two-step process is efficient and empirically grounded.\n\n3.  **Conclusion:**\n    *   Option A best embodies the principles of Enlightenment nosology by using the most specific and stable observable character (rash morphology) for the primary classification, thereby maximizing discriminative power and minimizing ambiguity at the outset. It then uses a second empirical character to resolve the remaining ambiguity, creating a clean, logical, and effective hierarchy.",

            "introduction": "Moving beyond anecdotal reports and ancient authority, Enlightenment thinkers championed the \"fair test\" as the ultimate arbiter of a treatment's effectiveness. This exercise places you in the role of a forward-thinking naval surgeon tasked with evaluating a new remedy for scurvy under the challenging conditions of an 18th-century sea voyage. You must design an experiment from first principles, making critical decisions about controls, allocation, and bias that are foundational to the modern clinical trial. ",
            "id": "4768655",
            "problem": "A Royal Navy surgeon in the mid-eighteenth century, influenced by Enlightenment commitments to systematic observation and fair comparison, wishes to test a new herbal infusion claimed to prevent and treat scurvy. On a voyage, he identifies a group of sailors with clearly defined scorbutic signs (spongy gums, petechiae, lassitude, and delayed wound healing). Citrus is in very short supply and used only sparingly for the most debilitated; common remedies in circulation include cider, vinegar, and diluted “elixir of vitriol.” The surgeon can standardize rations and hammocks for the sickbay but cannot guarantee identical flavors among remedies. He has one assistant who could administer doses and another who could perform clinical examinations.\n\nFrom first principles relevant to Enlightenment medical method—namely, the need for controlled comparison, minimizing confounding by balanced allocation, reducing expectation bias via feasible blinding, and selecting valid and reliable outcomes—choose the minimally sufficient experimental design that would allow a credible test of the new infusion under these constraints. Pay attention to allocation, the feasibility and target of blinding, standardization of co-interventions, and outcome measures that can be observed onboard without laboratory equipment.\n\nWhich option best satisfies these requirements?\n\nA. Enroll approximately $24$ sailors with moderate scurvy and similar baseline severity; keep all on identical rations and rest in the sickbay. Allocate them in a $1\\!:\\!1$ ratio to either the new infusion or to a commonly used comparator (for example, diluted “elixir of vitriol”) by drawing lots from a hat to ensure chance allocation. Have one assistant dispense pre-labeled bottles so that the examining surgeon does not know which remedy each man receives, acknowledging that sailors themselves will likely discern differences in taste and thus cannot be blinded. Predefine primary outcomes as time (in days) to resolution of a composite of clinical signs (reduced gum swelling and bleeding, improved ability to stand and work a light watch) assessed twice daily using a standardized checklist, with secondary outcomes of relapse within one week after apparent recovery and any adverse effects recorded. Avoid crossover before the primary endpoint unless safety requires rescue treatment.\n\nB. Enroll a group of sick sailors and keep their care as usual for one week while recording their symptoms; then give all of them the new infusion for one additional week and compare the average change in symptoms before versus after the infusion. Permit men to improve their diet if they feel stronger and to take additional remedies if requested. Because taste cannot be masked, do not attempt any blinding.\n\nC. Assign the sickest sailors to the new infusion to maximize the chance of observing an effect and keep the less severe cases on the ship’s standard remedies. Because the ship’s cooks vary rations by mess, allow diet to vary naturally, as this reflects “real-world” practice. Use survival until the end of the voyage as the primary outcome, reasoning that death is the most objective endpoint and requires no blinding.\n\nD. To preserve order, give the new infusion to all men in the starboard watch who become scorbutic and maintain the port watch on usual remedies. Do not constrain rations or duties beyond what the officers assign for seamanship. After one month, compare the proportion “recovered” between watches based on reports from each watch’s petty officer, who knows which men received the new infusion.\n\nE. Prepare two beverages of identical appearance and taste by flavoring both with strong bitters; give one to all scorbutic sailors and the other to healthy sailors as a placebo. Ensure both the sailors and the surgeon are unaware of who receives which beverage. Use laboratory quantification of “anti-scorbutic principle” in the blood as the primary outcome, with clinical symptoms as a secondary outcome, and plan sample size calculations to detect small differences with high power.",
            "solution": "Begin from core Enlightenment methodological commitments and related definitions that form a valid base for designing a fair test in the history of medicine context:\n\n1. Fair comparison requires concurrent controls to distinguish treatment effects from natural history and time-varying influences. Absent laboratory theory of “vitamins,” the Enlightenment emphasis on empiricism dictates side-by-side observation under as similar conditions as possible.\n\n2. Allocation by chance reduces confounding by balancing prognostic factors, especially when the sample size $n$ is small. Drawing lots implements chance allocation consistent with period practice and the concept that unknown causes are, in expectation, balanced across groups.\n\n3. Blinding reduces expectation and observer bias. When participant blinding is infeasible because of taste and odor, outcome-assessor blinding remains a feasible and valuable safeguard, provided dispensing and assessing roles are separated.\n\n4. Standardization of co-interventions (diet, rest, exposure) reduces performance bias and isolates the treatment contrast to the remedies under test.\n\n5. Outcome measures should be valid (reflect scurvy severity) and reliable (consistently observable in the shipboard setting). Time-to-clinical-improvement and return-to-duty are observable without instruments and are meaningful to naval practice.\n\nApply these principles to each option:\n\nOption A analysis:\n- Allocation: Uses drawing lots to achieve chance allocation in a $1\\!:\\!1$ ratio across approximately $24$ sailors, which is historically plausible and balances known and unknown prognostic factors in expectation. With $n \\approx 24$, exact balance on every factor is not guaranteed, but chance allocation is the minimally sufficient method to reduce systematic bias compared to judgmental assignment.\n- Blinding: Recognizes that participant blinding is likely infeasible due to taste differences, but preserves assessor blinding by separating dispensing (coded bottles) from examining. This directly targets observer bias while acknowledging constraints.\n- Co-interventions: Keeps rations and rest standardized in the sickbay, reducing performance bias and isolating the treatment effect to the remedies.\n- Outcomes: Predefines a clinically valid composite (gum changes, bleeding, functional capacity) and measures time to event (days), assessed at regular intervals with a checklist. This increases reliability and makes the endpoint directly relevant (fitness for duty), with a reasonable secondary outcome of short-term relapse and safety.\n- Ethical and practical sufficiency: Avoids crossover until a primary endpoint is reached, with allowance for rescue if needed. Given constraints on citrus, using a commonly accepted comparator is realistic. This embodies Enlightenment empiricism and the early “fair test” ideal.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption B analysis:\n- Allocation: No concurrent control group; a before-after design confounds treatment effect with natural history, regression to the mean, and time-varying factors (changes in weather, rations, workload).\n- Blinding: None; expectation effects on symptom reporting and observer bias are unmitigated.\n- Co-interventions: Permits diet and other remedies to vary after improvement, introducing performance bias precisely when improvement is attributed to the new infusion.\n- Outcomes: Symptom averages without standardization are vulnerable to measurement bias; no predefined objective threshold for improvement.\nVerdict: Incorrect, because it violates the need for a concurrent control and fails to minimize bias.\n\nOption C analysis:\n- Allocation: Intentionally assigns the sickest to the new infusion and less severe cases to control, guaranteeing baseline imbalance. Any difference in outcomes could reflect baseline severity rather than treatment effect; this inflates confounding rather than reducing it.\n- Blinding: None; both performance and observer biases are unchecked.\n- Co-interventions: Allows diet to vary by mess, introducing systematic differences unrelated to the infusion.\n- Outcomes: Mortality at voyage end is a coarse endpoint affected by many external factors (storms, infections, combat) and introduces variable follow-up time; it is not specific to scurvy recovery and fails the validity criterion for the question at hand.\nVerdict: Incorrect, due to severe confounding and outcome invalidity for the question at hand.\n\nOption D analysis:\n- Allocation: Assigns by watch, effectively clustering by duty schedule without randomization. With only $2$ clusters, differences in workload, exposure, and officer practices will drive between-group differences; cluster-level confounding is extreme, and chance balance is not achieved.\n- Blinding: Outcome reports come from petty officers who know treatment status, maximizing observer and expectation bias.\n- Co-interventions: Rations and duties are unconstrained, so systematic differences in exposure and nutrition are likely between watches.\n- Outcomes: “Recovered” is not operationally defined or standardized, decreasing reliability and increasing subjectivity.\nVerdict: Incorrect, because of non-random cluster allocation, lack of blinding, and nonstandardized outcomes.\n\nOption E analysis:\n- Allocation and blinding: Proposes double blinding with taste-matching via strong bitters; however, the design is fundamentally flawed because it allocates the treatment to scorbutic sailors and the \"placebo\" to healthy sailors. This does not create a valid control group for evaluating treatment efficacy, as the two groups are not comparable at baseline (sick vs. healthy).\n- Feasibility: The primary outcome, \"laboratory quantification of ‘anti-scorbutic principle’,\" is anachronistic and impossible with 18th-century technology. Concepts like formal sample size calculations to achieve high power are also modern statistical refinements not available at the time.\nVerdict: Incorrect, due to a fatal flaw in the comparison groups and reliance on anachronistic methods.\n\nBy derivation from first principles—concurrent control, chance allocation, feasible blinding of assessors, standardized co-interventions, and valid shipboard outcomes—Option A achieves a minimally sufficient, historically plausible Enlightenment-style fair test within constraints. The other options fail one or more foundational criteria in ways that would predictably bias results or render them uninterpretable.",
