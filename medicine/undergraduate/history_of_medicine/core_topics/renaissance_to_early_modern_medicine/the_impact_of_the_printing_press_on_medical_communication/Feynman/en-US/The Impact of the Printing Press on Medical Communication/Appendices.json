            "problem": "In the mid-fifteenth to sixteenth centuries, the adoption of the printing press transformed the dissemination of medical knowledge by enabling large print runs of standardized texts. Consider a medical printer who faces a fixed setup cost for typesetting and press preparation, denoted by $F$, and a constant variable cost per printed copy, denoted by $v$. By contrast, manuscript copying of the same text involves no setup cost but incurs a constant cost per copy, denoted by $m$, reflecting the labor-intensive process of clerical reproduction.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of total cost and average cost, let $T(n)$ be the total cost to produce $n$ copies by the printing press, and let $C(n)$ be the average cost per printed copy. Derive $C(n)$ from $T(n)$ using the definition of average cost as the total cost divided by the number of copies. Then, using a first-principles inequality comparison between $C(n)$ and the manuscript copying cost $m$, determine the exact closed-form expression for the continuous threshold number of copies $n$ at which printing becomes cheaper than manuscript copying. Express your final answer as an analytic function of $F$, $v$, and $m$, representing the smallest real-valued number of copies for which printing strictly undercuts manuscript copying in average cost.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the threshold number of copies at which mechanical printing becomes more cost-effective than manual manuscript copying. We shall approach this from first principles, beginning with the definitions of total and average costs.\n\nThe givens are:\n- $F$: the fixed setup cost for the printing press. This cost is incurred once, irrespective of the number of copies produced. We assume $F > 0$.\n- $v$: the variable cost per printed copy. This is a constant cost for each additional copy.\n- $m$: the constant cost per manuscript copy. This represents the cost of manual reproduction.\n- $n$: the number of copies produced. We consider $n$ as a continuous real-valued variable for the purpose of finding the threshold.\n\nFirst, we define the total cost function, $T(n)$, for producing $n$ copies using the printing press. The total cost is the sum of the fixed cost and the total variable cost. The total variable cost is the product of the per-copy variable cost, $v$, and the number of copies, $n$.\n$$T(n) = F + vn$$\n\nNext, we derive the average cost per printed copy, $C(n)$. The problem states that the average cost is the total cost divided by the number of copies.\n$$C(n) = \\frac{T(n)}{n}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T(n)$, we obtain:\n$$C(n) = \\frac{F + vn}{n}$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing each term in the numerator by $n$:\n$$C(n) = \\frac{F}{n} + v$$\nThis equation shows that the average cost of a printed copy is a decreasing function of $n$, approaching the variable cost $v$ as $n$ becomes very large.\n\nThe cost of producing one copy via manuscript is given as a constant, $m$. This can be viewed as the average cost of manuscript production, which is independent of the number of copies.\n\nTo determine the threshold at which printing becomes cheaper than manuscript copying, we need to find the number of copies $n$ for which the average cost of printing, $C(n)$, is strictly less than the cost of a manuscript copy, $m$. This condition is expressed by the inequality:\n$$C(n) < m$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $C(n)$:\n$$\\frac{F}{n} + v < m$$\nTo solve for $n$, we first must consider the condition for a non-trivial solution to exist. If the variable cost of printing $v$ were greater than or equal to the cost of a manuscript copy $m$ (i.e., $v \\ge m$), then since $\\frac{F}{n}$ is always positive for $F > 0$ and $n > 0$, the inequality $\\frac{F}{n} + v < m$ could never be satisfied. Therefore, for printing to ever become more economical, it is a necessary precondition that the variable cost of printing is less than the cost of manual copying, i.e., $v < m$. This ensures that the term $m - v$ is a positive quantity.\n\nProceeding with the solution of the inequality under the condition $v < m$:\n$$\\frac{F}{n} < m - v$$\nSince we are seeking a positive number of copies, $n > 0$. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $n$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$F < n(m - v)$$\nNow, to isolate $n$, we divide both sides by the positive quantity $(m - v)$:\n$$n > \\frac{F}{m-v}$$\nThis inequality specifies the condition on the number of copies, $n$, for the average cost of printing to be strictly lower than the cost of manuscript copying. The \"threshold number of copies\" is the boundary value of this condition. It represents the exact, continuous value of $n$ where the costs are equal, and for any number of copies infinitesimally larger than this value, printing becomes the cheaper option. Thus, the threshold is the smallest value of $n$ that satisfies the boundary of the strict inequality.\n\nThe exact closed-form expression for this continuous threshold number of copies is therefore:\n$$n_{threshold} = \\frac{F}{m-v}$$",

            "problem": "In the manuscript era preceding typographic standardization, medical recipes were transmitted through serial copying by scribes. Consider a single recipe undergoing $n$ sequential reproductions in such a chain.

Using only the complement rule in probability and the independence of trials, derive an analytic expression for the probability that by the end of the $n$th reproduction the recipe contains at least one clinically relevant copying error relative to the original source.

No numerical evaluation is required, and no units are needed. Do not express your answer as a percentage.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probability that a recipe contains at least one clinically relevant copying error after $n$ sequential reproductions. We are given the following:\n- The number of reproductions is $n$.\n- Each reproduction is an independent Bernoulli trial.\n- The probability of introducing at least one error in a single reproduction is $p$.\n- The probability of not introducing any error in a single reproduction is $1-p$.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that the recipe contains at least one clinically relevant copying error after the full chain of $n$ reproductions, relative to the original source. The problem asks for the probability of this event, $P(A)$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the derivation must use the complement rule. The complement of event $A$, denoted $A^c$, is the event that the recipe contains *no* clinically relevant copying errors after $n$ reproductions. By the complement rule, the probability of event $A$ is given by:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\n\nThe event $A^c$ occurs if and only if no errors are introduced in the first reproduction, AND no errors are introduced in the second reproduction, AND so on, for all $n$ reproductions.\n\nLet $E_i$ be the event that at least one error is introduced in the $i$-th reproduction, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We are given $P(E_i) = p$.\nLet $E_i^c$ be the complement event, meaning no error is introduced in the $i$-th reproduction. The probability of this event is $P(E_i^c) = 1-p$.\n\nThe event $A^c$ can be expressed as the intersection of all the individual \"no error\" events:\n$$A^c = E_1^c \\cap E_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap E_n^c = \\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} E_i^c$$\n\nThe problem states that each reproduction is an independent trial. Therefore, the events $E_1^c, E_2^c, \\dots, E_n^c$ are mutually independent. The probability of the intersection of independent events is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} E_i^c\\right) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i^c)$$\n\nSince $P(E_i^c) = 1-p$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$, we have:\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} (1-p) = (1-p)^n$$\n\nNow, substituting this result back into the expression for $P(A)$ using the complement rule:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c) = 1 - (1-p)^n$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the probability that the recipe contains at least one error after $n$ reproductions.\n\nFor the interpretation, let us denote this probability as $P_{\\text{total}}(p, n) = 1 - (1-p)^n$. The printing press is characterized by a much smaller per-reproduction error probability, $p_{\\text{print}}$, where $p_{\\text{print}} \\ll p$. The total probability of error in a chain of $n$ printed reproductions is therefore $P_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{print}}, n) = 1 - (1-p_{\\text{print}})^n$.\n\nTo understand the implication, we examine the function $f(p) = 1 - (1-p)^n$ for a fixed $n > 0$ and $p \\in [0, 1]$. Its derivative with respect to $p$ is:\n$$\\frac{df}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\left(1 - (1-p)^n\\right) = -n(1-p)^{n-1}(-1) = n(1-p)^{n-1}$$\nFor $p \\in [0, 1)$ and $n \\ge 1$, this derivative is non-negative, meaning $P_{\\text{total}}(p, n)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $p$. Since $p_{\\text{print}} \\ll p$, it follows directly that $P_{\\text{total}}(p_{\\text{print}}, n) \\ll P_{\\text{total}}(p, n)$.\n\nThis mathematical result has a profound implication for clinical reliability. In the manuscript era, even a small scribal error probability $p$ could accumulate over a chain of $n$ copies, leading to a high probability that the final recipe was corrupted. For instance, if $p=0.05$ and a recipe is copied $n=20$ times, the probability of at least one error is $1 - (1-0.05)^{20} \\approx 1 - (0.95)^{20} \\approx 1 - 0.358 = 0.642$.\nWith the printing press, typographic standardization drastically reduces the error rate to $p_{\\text{print}}$. If $p_{\\text{print}}$ were, for example, $0.001$, the probability of error over the same number of reproductions becomes $1 - (1-0.001)^{20} \\approx 1 - (0.999)^{20} \\approx 1 - 0.980 = 0.02$.\n\nThe printing press, by replacing a high-error process (manual copying) with a low-error one (mechanical reproduction), fundamentally increased the fidelity of medical information transmission. This ensured that texts, including crucial medical recipes and anatomical descriptions, could be disseminated widely without significant degradation, thereby fostering a more stable and reliable foundation for medical practice and education across vast geographical areas. The expression $1 - (1-p)^n$ precisely quantifies this exponential improvement in reliability.",

            "introduction": "The ability to mass-produce standardized documents opened the door to new forms of data analysis and public health surveillance. Early modern cities began printing \"Bills of Mortality,\" which allowed authorities to track deaths and detect patterns, such as the outbreak of an epidemic. This exercise places you in the role of an early epidemiologist, using basic statistical tools to analyze mortality data and identify significant deviations from the norm, a practice made possible by the printing press .",
            "id": "4774057",
            "problem": "In the mid-seventeenth century, the spread of movable-type printing enabled cities to issue standardized annual Bills of Mortality (BoM), which reported total deaths and population counts using consistent categories. This standardization allowed physicians and civic authorities to compare mortality across years and cities and to detect unusual patterns that might signal epidemics. Consider a city whose printed BoM reports $2{,}000$ deaths in a population of $100{,}000$ for a single year. Historical aggregation of printed BoM over two prior decades across comparable cities yields an annual crude mortality baseline described by an average rate of $0.018$ and a standard deviation of $0.002$, both expressed as decimal fractions of the population per year. Using core definitions and standardization grounded in widely accepted statistical practice, compute the city’s annual crude mortality rate for that year and then quantify its position relative to the historical baseline by producing a single standardized deviation value. Express the crude rate as a decimal (do not use a percentage sign) and report only the standardized deviation as your final answer. Round your final reported value to four significant figures. No units are required for the final reported value.",
            "solution": "The first step is to compute the city's annual crude mortality rate for the specified year. The crude mortality rate, denoted here as $r$, is defined as the total number of deaths ($D$) in a population ($P$) over a given time period, divided by the size of the population.\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{D}{P}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $D = 2,000$ deaths\n-   $P = 100,000$ persons\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{2,000}{100,000} = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02\n$$\n\nThe city's annual crude mortality rate for the year is $0.02$.\n\nThe second step is to quantify the position of this observed rate relative to the historical baseline. This is accomplished by calculating the standardized deviation, commonly known as a z-score. The z-score measures how many standard deviations an observation is from the mean of the distribution. The formula for the z-score, $z$, is:\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\n\nIn this context:\n-   $x$ is the observed data point, which is the city's calculated crude mortality rate, $r = 0.02$.\n-   $\\mu$ is the mean of the historical distribution, given as $\\mu = 0.018$.\n-   $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the historical distribution, given as $\\sigma = 0.002$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the z-score formula:\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{0.02 - 0.018}{0.002}\n$$\n\n$$\nz = \\frac{0.002}{0.002}\n$$\n\n$$\nz = 1\n$$\n\nThe calculated standardized deviation is exactly $1$. The problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express the integer $1$ with four significant figures, it is written as $1.000$. This value indicates that the city's mortality rate for the year was exactly one standard deviation above the historical average.",
