This exercise demonstrates how the concentrations of a few key substances—sodium, glucose, and urea—can provide a robust estimate of the osmotic pressure that all cells in the body experience. This practice  connects the abstract concept of the *milieu intérieur* to a tangible, clinically relevant calculation.",

            "problem": "Claude Bernard framed the stability of the organism as dependent on the constancy of the internal environment (the \"milieu intérieur\"), a theme that later became central to physiological homeostasis. One quantitative lens on this constancy is plasma osmolarity, which reflects the total concentration of osmotically active particles. Starting from the ideal dilute-solution assumption and the colligative property that osmotic pressure depends only on the number of particles irrespective of their identity, use the van 't Hoff perspective that each solute contributes a number of particles equal to its effective dissociation count to derive a practical expression for plasma osmolarity in terms of dominant small solutes. In typical plasma, sodium salts (for example, sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate) dissociate nearly completely into cations and anions, while glucose and urea do not dissociate.\n \nAssume:\n- Electroneutrality ensures that the total anion concentration approximately matches the total cation concentration from sodium salts, so each mole of sodium salts contributes approximately two moles of particles.\n- Glucose and urea are present as non-dissociated solutes, contributing one particle per molecule.\n- Contributions from other solutes (for example, potassium, calcium, proteins) are negligible for this approximation.\n\nGiven the following measured concentrations in a nineteenth-century style physiology lab replicating Bernard’s approach to quantifying the internal environment:\n- Sodium ion concentration $[Na^{+}] = 140$ millimolar,\n- Glucose concentration $[Glucose] = 5$ millimolar,\n- Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) concentration $[BUN] = 5$ millimolar,\n\nderive the approximate plasma osmolarity from first principles as outlined and calculate its numerical value. Express your final answer in milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L). No rounding specification is required; provide the exact integer if it arises naturally from the calculation.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of osmolarity and colligative properties, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe task is to derive a practical expression for plasma osmolarity, $\\text{Osm}_p$, and calculate its value based on the contributions of the dominant small solutes as outlined. Plasma osmolarity is a measure of the total concentration of osmotically active particles in a solution. According to the van 't Hoff principle for ideal dilute solutions, the total osmolarity is the sum of the osmolar contributions of each individual solute.\n\nThe osmolar contribution of a solute is its molar concentration, $C$, multiplied by the number of particles, $n$, it dissociates into in solution. The general expression is:\n$$ \\text{Osm} = \\sum_{i} n_i C_i $$\nwhere $i$ ranges over all solutes. The problem specifies that we should consider only sodium salts, glucose, and urea, and that we can neglect the contributions of other solutes. Therefore, the approximate plasma osmolarity, $\\text{Osm}_p$, can be written as:\n$$ \\text{Osm}_p \\approx (\\text{Osm}_{\\text{sodium salts}}) + (\\text{Osm}_{\\text{glucose}}) + (\\text{Osm}_{\\text{urea}}) $$\n\nWe will now analyze each term based on the provided assumptions.\n\n1.  **Contribution from Sodium Salts**: The primary sodium salts in plasma are sodium chloride ($NaCl$) and sodium bicarbonate ($NaHCO_3$). The problem states these dissociate nearly completely. Crucially, it is assumed that for the purpose of this approximation, electroneutrality ensures that the concentration of the corresponding anions ($[Cl^{-}]$, $[HCO_3^{-}]$, etc.) is approximately equal to the concentration of sodium cations, $[Na^{+}]$. This means that for every sodium ion, there is effectively one anion, leading to a total of two osmotically active particles for each formula unit of sodium salt. Thus, the number of particles $n_{Na^+} = 2$. The total osmolar contribution from sodium salts can therefore be approximated as twice the sodium ion concentration.\n    $$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{sodium salts}} \\approx 2 \\times [Na^{+}] $$\n\n2.  **Contribution from Glucose**: The problem states that glucose, $[Glucose]$, does not dissociate. This means each molecule of glucose contributes one osmotically active particle. Therefore, its van 't Hoff factor is $n_{glucose} = 1$.\n    $$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{glucose}} = 1 \\times [Glucose] = [Glucose] $$\n\n3.  **Contribution from Urea**: Similarly, urea is described as a non-dissociating solute. Each molecule of urea contributes one osmotically active particle, so its van 't Hoff factor is $n_{urea} = 1$. The problem provides the concentration as Blood Urea Nitrogen, $[BUN]$. In this context, where the concentration is given in millimolar units ($mmol/L$), $[BUN]$ is taken to represent the molar concentration of the urea molecule itself, $[Urea]$.\n    $$ \\text{Osm}_{\\text{urea}} = 1 \\times [Urea] = [Urea] \\approx [BUN] $$\n\nCombining these contributions, we derive the practical expression for approximate plasma osmolarity:\n$$ \\text{Osm}_p \\approx 2 \\times [Na^{+}] + [Glucose] + [BUN] $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this derived formula:\n-   Sodium ion concentration: $[Na^{+}] = 140 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$\n-   Glucose concentration: $[Glucose] = 5 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$\n-   Blood Urea Nitrogen concentration: $[BUN] = 5 \\, \\text{mmol/L}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ \\text{Osm}_p \\approx 2 \\times (140) + 5 + 5 $$\n$$ \\text{Osm}_p \\approx 280 + 5 + 5 $$\n$$ \\text{Osm}_p \\approx 290 $$\n\nThe units for concentration are millimolar ($mmol/L$). Since osmolarity measures the moles of solute particles, the resulting unit is milliosmoles per liter ($mOsm/L$), as requested. The calculation yields an exact integer.",

Consider the plasma glucose concentration, denoted by $G(t)$ in units of $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}}$, treated as a single well-mixed compartment of the inner environment. Starting from the conservation of mass principle for a control volume, construct the time-evolution equation for $G(t)$ by identifying sources and sinks of glucose in plasma.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the steady-state fasting glucose concentration, denoted $G^{\\ast}$, based on a simplified model of glucose homeostasis, which is a quantitative representation of Claude Bernard's concept of the *milieu intérieur*. We begin by applying the fundamental principle of conservation of mass.\n\nLet $G(t)$ be the plasma glucose concentration in a single, well-mixed compartment of constant volume $V$. The total mass of glucose in this compartment is $M(t) = V G(t)$. The conservation of mass principle states that the time rate of change of the total mass of glucose is the sum of all source rates minus the sum of all sink rates.\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = \\sum (\\text{Mass Influx Rate}) - \\sum (\\text{Mass Efflux Rate})\n$$\nSubstituting $M(t) = V G(t)$ and assuming $V$ is constant, we get:\n$$\nV \\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = \\dot{M}_{\\text{sources}} - \\dot{M}_{\\text{sinks}}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{M}$ denotes a rate of change of mass (e.g., in units of $\\mathrm{mmol\\,s^{-1}}$). The problem defines the source and sink terms, $R$ and $U$, as functions of the concentration $G$. For the standard kinetic equation for concentration $\\frac{dG}{dt}$ to hold, these terms must represent rates of change of concentration (e.g., in units of $\\mathrm{mmol\\,L^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$). These are related to the mass rates by $\\dot{M} / V$. Dividing the mass balance equation by the volume $V$, we obtain the time-evolution equation for the concentration $G(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\dot{M}_{\\text{sources}}}{V} - \\frac{\\dot{M}_{\\text{sinks}}}{V}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the sources as hepatic production, $R_{\\text{hepatic}}(G)$, and dietary input, $R_{\\text{diet}}(t)$. The sink is specified as tissue uptake, $U_{\\text{tissue}}(G)$. Therefore, the governing ordinary differential equation for $G(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = R_{\\text{hepatic}}(G) + R_{\\text{diet}}(t) - U_{\\text{tissue}}(G)\n$$\nWe are given the explicit functional forms for these terms:\n1.  Hepatic production: $R_{\\text{hepatic}}(G) = R_{b} - k_{h} G$, where $R_{b} > 0$ is a basal production rate and $k_{h} > 0$ is the feedback gain constant.\n2.  Dietary input: $R_{\\text{diet}}(t)$.\n3.  Tissue uptake: $U_{\\text{tissue}}(G) = k_{u} G$, where $k_{u} > 0$ is the uptake rate constant.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the governing equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = (R_{b} - k_{h} G) + R_{\\text{diet}}(t) - (k_{u} G)\n$$\nThe problem requires the analysis to be performed under the fasting condition. Under fasting, the dietary input of glucose is zero. Thus, we set $R_{\\text{diet}}(t) = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = R_{b} - k_{h} G - k_{u} G\n$$\nWe can collect the terms proportional to $G$:\n$$\n\\frac{dG(t)}{dt} = R_{b} - (k_{h} + k_{u}) G\n$$\nThe steady-state concentration, denoted $G^{\\ast}$, is the value of the concentration for which the system is in equilibrium, meaning the concentration does not change with time. This is mathematically defined by the condition $\\frac{dG}{dt} = 0$. Applying this condition to our equation, with $G = G^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n0 = R_{b} - (k_{h} + k_{u}) G^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for $G^{\\ast}$. Rearranging the terms, we move the part containing $G^{\\ast}$ to the left-hand side:\n$$\n(k_{h} + k_{u}) G^{\\ast} = R_{b}\n$$\nFinally, to isolate $G^{\\ast}$, we divide by the coefficient $(k_{h} + k_{u})$. Since it is given that $k_{h} > 0$ and $k_{u} > 0$, their sum $(k_{h} + k_{u})$ is strictly positive, and the division is well-defined.\n$$\nG^{\\ast} = \\frac{R_{b}}{k_{h} + k_{u}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the steady-state fasting glucose concentration in terms of the given parameters $R_{b}$, $k_{h}$, and $k_{u}$. The result is physically reasonable as all parameters are positive, yielding a positive concentration $G^{\\ast} > 0$.",
