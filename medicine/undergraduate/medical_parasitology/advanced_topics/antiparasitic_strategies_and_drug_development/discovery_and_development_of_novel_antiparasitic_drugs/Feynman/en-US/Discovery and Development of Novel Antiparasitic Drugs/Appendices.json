            "problem": "A helminth motility assay is configured on a $384$-well plate to evaluate the suitability of the readout for high-throughput screening. The assay quantifies motility as a continuous motility index per well (arbitrary units) using an image-based tracker. On the same plate, wells containing a strong paralytic reference drug (positive control, expected low motility) and wells containing vehicle alone (negative control, expected high motility) are interleaved to estimate the assay’s dynamic range and noise.\n\nAcross $64$ negative-control wells (vehicle), the plate-level summary yields a mean motility index of $\\mu_{n} = 93.1$ and a sample variance of $s_{n}^{2} = 38.44$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and high-throughput screening (HTS) assay validation. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data ($\\mu_n, s_n^2, \\mu_p, s_p^2$) to calculate the requested metric, the Z-prime factor. The terminology, while using $\\mu$ to denote a sample mean rather than the more rigorous $\\bar{x}$, is standard practice in the relevant biological literature and its meaning is unambiguous in this context. The problem is therefore solvable.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Z-prime factor ($Z'$-factor), a statistical parameter used to assess the quality of an HTS assay. It quantifies the separation between the distributions of the positive and negative controls. The formula for the $Z'$-factor is:\n$$ Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(\\sigma_p + \\sigma_n)}{|\\mu_p - \\mu_n|} $$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ and $\\sigma_n$ are the mean and standard deviation of the negative controls, and $\\mu_p$ and $\\sigma_p$ are the mean and standard deviation of the positive controls. The sample statistics provided are used as estimates for these population parameters.\n\nThe given data from the problem statement are:\nFor the negative controls (vehicle):\nMean motility index, $\\mu_n = 93.1$\nSample variance, $s_n^2 = 38.44$\nNumber of wells, $N_n = 64$\n\nFor the positive controls (drug):\nMean motility index, $\\mu_p = 13.7$\nSample variance, $s_p^2 = 19.36$\nNumber of wells, $N_p = 64$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the sample standard deviations, $s_n$ and $s_p$, from the given sample variances. The sample standard deviation is the square root of the sample variance. The problem notes that the provided sample variances include the Bessel correction ($n-1$ denominator), which is appropriate.\n\nThe standard deviation for the negative controls is:\n$$ s_n = \\sqrt{s_n^2} = \\sqrt{38.44} = 6.2 $$\nThe standard deviation for the positive controls is:\n$$ s_p = \\sqrt{s_p^2} = \\sqrt{19.36} = 4.4 $$\n\nNow, these values can be substituted into the $Z'$-factor formula. We use the sample means $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$ and the sample standard deviations $s_n$ and $s_p$.\n$$ Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(s_p + s_n)}{|\\mu_p - \\mu_n|} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(4.4 + 6.2)}{|13.7 - 93.1|} $$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms in the numerator and the denominator.\nThe sum of the standard deviations is:\n$$ s_p + s_n = 4.4 + 6.2 = 10.6 $$\nThe absolute difference between the means is:\n$$ |\\mu_p - \\mu_n| = |13.7 - 93.1| = |-79.4| = 79.4 $$\nNow, these results are substituted back into the expression for $Z'$:\n$$ Z' = 1 - \\frac{3(10.6)}{79.4} = 1 - \\frac{31.8}{79.4} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ \\frac{31.8}{79.4} \\approx 0.400503778... $$\nFinally, we complete the calculation for the $Z'$-factor:\n$$ Z' = 1 - 0.400503778... \\approx 0.599496221... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ Z' \\approx 0.5995 $$\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an interpretation of this result regarding the assay's suitability for HTS. The $Z'$-factor is a widely accepted benchmark for assay quality, with the following standard criteria:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $Z' = 1$: An ideal assay with no variability.\n    \\item $1 > Z' \\geq 0.5$: An excellent assay, robust and suitable for HTS.\n    \\item $0.5 > Z' > 0$: A marginal assay. Screening might be possible, but the assay may be sensitive to experimental noise and produce a high rate of false positives or false negatives.\n    \\item $Z' \\leq 0$: The assay is unsuitable for screening, as the signal from the controls excessively overlaps.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe calculated value, $Z' \\approx 0.5995$, falls comfortably within the range for an excellent assay ($1 > Z' \\geq 0.5$). This indicates a large dynamic range (separation between $\\mu_n$ and $\\mu_p$) relative to the data variability (represented by $s_n$ and $s_p$). Therefore, this helminth motility assay configuration demonstrates a clear and robust separation between the positive and negative controls and is considered highly suitable for use in a high-throughput screening campaign to identify novel antiparasitic compounds.",
