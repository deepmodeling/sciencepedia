            "problem": "A chronic infection by the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini is epidemiologically linked to cholangiocarcinoma. A key mechanistic hypothesis is that persistent inflammation elevates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which oxidize guanine in DNA to form 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). Let a single cholangiocyte experience an expected daily rate of ROS microbursts denoted by $\\rho$ (events per cell per day). Each ROS microburst produces an expected yield of $\\eta$ 8-oxodG lesions per cell.

A hypothesized mechanism involves persistent inflammation, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) from guanine oxidation in DNA.\n- **$\\rho$**: The expected daily rate of ROS microbursts, in units of events per cell per day.\n- **$\\eta$**: The expected yield of 8-oxodG lesions per ROS microburst, in units of lesions per event.\n- **$r$**: The fraction of newly formed 8-oxodG lesions removed by the base excision repair (BER) pathway within the same day.\n- **$(1-r)$**: The fraction of newly formed 8-oxodG lesions that remain unrepaired.\n- **Assumptions**: Stationarity (constant $\\rho$, $\\eta$, $r$), independence of repair events, and linearity of expectation.\n- **Time Interval**: $365$ days.\n- **Objective 1**: Derive the expected annual burden $B$ of 8-oxodG lesions per cell in terms of $\\rho$, $\\eta$, and $r$.\n- **Objective 2**: Evaluate $B$ for the parameter values $\\rho = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$ events per cell per day, $\\eta = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ lesions per event, and $r = 0.92$.\n- **Constraint**: Round the final numerical answer to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against the specified criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of molecular biology, toxicology, and carcinogenesis. The link between *O. viverrini* infection, chronic inflammation, ROS, DNA damage (specifically 8-oxodG), and cholangiocarcinoma is a well-documented and researched topic in medical parasitology. The model presented is a simplified but mechanistically plausible representation of these processes.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($\\rho$, $\\eta$, $r$), a time frame ($365$ days), and explicit assumptions (stationarity, independence, linearity) required to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The objectives are clearly stated.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\nNo flaws are detected. The problem is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, pseudo-profound, or outside the realm of scientific verifiability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe derivation proceeds by establishing the daily rate of lesion formation, accounting for repair, and then integrating over the specified time period.\n\n1.  **Expected Daily Formation of Lesions**:\n    The expected number of ROS microbursts occurring in a single cell per day is given by $\\rho$. Each event produces an expected yield of $\\eta$ lesions. By the law of total expectation (or the assumption of linearity of expectation), the total expected number of 8-oxodG lesions formed per cell per day, which we shall denote as $L_{formed}$, is the product of the rate of events and the yield per event.\n    $$L_{formed} = \\rho \\eta$$\n\n2.  **Expected Daily Accumulation of Unrepaired Lesions**:\n    The base excision repair (BER) pathway removes a fraction $r$ of these newly formed lesions on the day they are created. Consequently, a fraction $(1-r)$ of the lesions escape repair and contribute to the cumulative burden. The expected number of lesions that remain unrepaired per cell per day, denoted as $L_{unrepaired}$, is:\n    $$L_{unrepaired} = L_{formed} \\times (1 - r) = \\rho \\eta (1 - r)$$\n\n3.  **Expected Annual Burden of Lesions**:\n    The problem asks for the expected annual burden, $B$, over a period of $365$ days. The assumption of stationarity implies that the daily rate of accumulation, $L_{unrepaired}$, is constant for each of the $365$ days. Therefore, the total cumulative burden over the year is the daily accumulation rate multiplied by the number of days.\n    $$B = L_{unrepaired} \\times 365$$\n    Substituting the expression for $L_{unrepaired}$, we arrive at the symbolic formula for the expected annual burden:\n    $$B = 365 \\rho \\eta (1 - r)$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the provided parameter values:\n- $\\rho = 1.8 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $\\eta = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $r = 0.92$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $B$:\n$$B = 365 \\times (1.8 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (1 - 0.92)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the product of $\\rho$ and $\\eta$:\n$$\\rho \\eta = (1.8 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) = (1.8 \\times 2.5) \\times 10^{4-3} = 4.5 \\times 10^{1} = 45$$\nThis is the expected number of lesions formed per cell per day.\n\nNext, we calculate the fraction of unrepaired lesions:\n$$1 - r = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$$\n\nNow, we compute the daily accumulation of unrepaired lesions:\n$$L_{unrepaired} = \\rho \\eta (1-r) = 45 \\times 0.08 = 3.6$$\nThis is the expected number of unrepaired lesions accumulating per cell per day.\n\nFinally, we calculate the total annual burden, $B$:\n$$B = 365 \\times L_{unrepaired} = 365 \\times 3.6 = 1314$$\n\nThe result is $1314$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number $1314$ already consists of four significant figures ($1$, $3$, $1$, $4$), so no further rounding is necessary. The final answer is $1314$ lesions per cell per year.",

This practice places you in the role of a cell biologist tasked with interpreting experimental data to differentiate these dual mechanisms .

They fractionate the ESPs into two biochemically distinct pools, Fraction X (enriched for proteolytic enzymes and oxidized lipids) and Fraction Y (enriched for a granulin-like peptide). The team seeks to classify which fraction behaves as a toxin-like effector that directly damages host epithelia versus which behaves as a growth factor-like effector that drives host epithelial proliferation and survival, contributing to parasite-induced carcinogenesis. They expose primary human cholangiocyte monolayers to each fraction separately and perform readouts that include: (i) plasma membrane integrity assays, (ii) mitochondrial polarization, (iii) intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), (iv) DNA damage markers, including phosphorylated histone H2AX ($\\gamma$-H2AX) foci and alkaline comet assay, (v) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation profiling, focusing on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), (vi) downstream kinase signaling, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase B (AKT), (vii) cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and E, and (viii) apoptosis/survival effectors such as B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and caspase-3 cleavage. Pharmacologic tools include an EGFR kinase inhibitor and a pan-caspase inhibitor. \n\nUse the following foundational facts: \n- Ligand–receptor binding to RTKs (for example, EGFR) induces receptor autophosphorylation and activation of canonical survival and proliferation cascades (for example, RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and phosphoinositide $3$-kinase–AKT), promoting cell cycle entry (for example, cyclin D1 induction and G$_1$–S transition) and anti-apoptotic programs (for example, Bcl-2 upregulation, reduced caspase-3 cleavage).\n- Direct cytotoxic injury is characterized by early membrane damage, mitochondrial depolarization, increased ROS, and DNA lesions (for example, increased $\\gamma$-H2AX foci and comet tail moments), often leading to p53 activation and apoptosis that may be transiently suppressed by caspase inhibition. \n- A key discriminator is specificity and reversibility by receptor blockade: growth factor-like effects depend on cognate receptor signaling and are attenuated by RTK inhibition, whereas toxin-like direct injury is not reversed by RTK inhibition.\n\nWhich option most consistently distinguishes a toxin-like fraction from a growth factor-like fraction in this experimental system?\n\nA. Fraction X rapidly increases intracellular ROS, elevates $\\gamma$-H2AX foci, increases lactate dehydrogenase release, and causes mitochondrial depolarization, with minimal change in ERK or AKT phosphorylation; pan-caspase inhibitor reduces death but EGFR inhibition has no effect. Fraction Y induces EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream ERK and AKT activation, upregulates cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, increases S-phase entry, and reduces caspase-3 cleavage in serum-deprived cells; these effects are abrogated by EGFR inhibition. \n\nB. Fraction X induces robust EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation accompanied by increased cyclin D1 and reduced apoptosis after genotoxic stress; these effects persist despite EGFR inhibition but are reversed by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Fraction Y causes marked ROS, $\\gamma$-H2AX foci, and membrane rupture that are prevented by EGFR inhibition.\n\nC. Fraction X elevates secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from cholangiocytes, with no changes in RTK signaling or cell cycle regulators and no DNA damage. Fraction Y increases neutrophil migration in a transwell assay and induces p53 accumulation with increased apoptosis; both effects are blocked by EGFR inhibition.\n\nD. Fraction X causes DNA interstrand crosslinking and bulky adduct formation with increased comet tail moments, p53 stabilization, and caspase-3 cleavage; EGFR inhibition does not alter these outcomes but a pan-caspase inhibitor transiently reduces cell death. Fraction Y induces immediate early gene expression and sustained ERK and AKT phosphorylation with increased cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 and decreased apoptosis under serum starvation; these effects are lost with EGFR inhibition and reproduced by epidermal growth factor as a positive control.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Biological System:** A carcinogenesis-associated trematode colonizing biliary epithelium.\n- **Substances Studied:** Excretory–secretory products (ESPs) from the trematode, fractionated into two pools.\n- **Fraction X Composition:** Enriched for proteolytic enzymes and oxidized lipids.\n- **Fraction Y Composition:** Enriched for a granulin-like peptide.\n- **Objective:** Classify each fraction as either a \"toxin-like effector\" (direct damage) or a \"growth factor-like effector\" (proliferation/survival driver).\n- **Experimental Model:** Primary human cholangiocyte monolayers.\n- **Experimental Readouts:** (i) plasma membrane integrity, (ii) mitochondrial polarization, (iii) intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), (iv) DNA damage markers ($\\gamma$-H2AX, alkaline comet assay), (v) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) phosphorylation (EGFR), (vi) downstream signaling (ERK, AKT), (vii) cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, cyclin E), (viii) apoptosis/survival effectors (Bcl-2, caspase-3 cleavage).\n- **Pharmacologic Tools:** An EGFR kinase inhibitor and a pan-caspase inhibitor.\n- **Foundational Fact 1 (Growth Factor-like):** Ligand binding to RTKs (e.g., EGFR) leads to receptor autophosphorylation, activation of RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and phosphoinositide $3$-kinase–AKT pathways, promoting cell cycle entry (e.g., cyclin D1 induction, G$_1$–S transition) and survival (e.g., Bcl-2 upregulation, reduced caspase-3 cleavage).\n- **Foundational Fact 2 (Toxin-like):** Direct cytotoxic injury is characterized by early membrane damage, mitochondrial depolarization, increased ROS, and DNA lesions (e.g., increased $\\gamma$-H2AX foci, comet tails), leading to p53 activation and apoptosis, which can be suppressed by caspase inhibition.\n- **Foundational Fact 3 (Key Discriminator):** Growth factor-like effects are attenuated by RTK inhibition, whereas toxin-like direct injury is not.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically valid.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The scenario is highly realistic. Liver flukes like *Opisthorchis viverrini* are Group $1$ carcinogens known to cause cholangiocarcinoma. Their ESPs contain a mixture of mitogenic factors (like granulin, which can activate EGFR) and damaging factors (proteases, ROS-generating molecules) that collectively drive carcinogenesis through a combination of chronic inflammation, direct cytotoxicity, and promotion of cell proliferation. The described experimental assays and signaling pathways are standard in modern cancer cell biology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear, distinct definitions for \"toxin-like\" and \"growth factor-like\" effects and explicitly states the \"key discriminator\" (sensitivity to RTK inhibition) required to differentiate them. The question asks for the option that presents a set of experimental results consistent with these definitions. A unique and meaningful answer can be derived.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n- **Conclusion of Validation:** The problem is free from scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, and ambiguity. It is a valid, well-posed problem in medical cell biology.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Solution\nThe task is to identify the option that presents a set of experimental outcomes correctly classifying one fraction as a toxin-like effector and the other as a growth factor-like effector, according to the provided definitions.\n\n**Defining the Expected Profiles:**\n1.  A **toxin-like effector** (predicted for Fraction X, given its composition of proteases and oxidized lipids) should cause direct cellular damage. The expected experimental signature is:\n    - Increased markers of damage: ↑ROS, ↑DNA damage ($\\gamma$-H2AX, comet tails), ↓mitochondrial polarization, ↑membrane permeability (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase release).\n    - Consequence: Apoptosis (e.g., ↑caspase-3 cleavage), which is suppressible by a pan-caspase inhibitor.\n    - **Key Discriminator:** These effects must be **independent** of EGFR signaling, meaning they are **not** blocked by an EGFR inhibitor.\n\n2.  A **growth factor-like effector** (predicted for Fraction Y, given its granulin-like peptide composition) should activate specific signaling pathways to promote cell proliferation and survival. The expected experimental signature is:\n    - Activation of specific signaling: ↑EGFR phosphorylation, ↑ERK and ↑AKT phosphorylation.\n    - Pro-proliferative and pro-survival effects: ↑cyclin D1/E, ↑S-phase entry, ↑Bcl-2, ↓caspase-3 cleavage.\n    - **Key Discriminator:** These effects must be **dependent** on EGFR signaling, meaning they are **abrogated** by an EGFR inhibitor.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Fraction X rapidly increases intracellular ROS, elevates $\\gamma$-H2AX foci, increases lactate dehydrogenase release, and causes mitochondrial depolarization, with minimal change in ERK or AKT phosphorylation; pan-caspase inhibitor reduces death but EGFR inhibition has no effect. Fraction Y induces EGFR autophosphorylation and downstream ERK and AKT activation, upregulates cyclin D1 and Bcl-2, increases S-phase entry, and reduces caspase-3 cleavage in serum-deprived cells; these effects are abrogated by EGFR inhibition.**\n\n- **Fraction X Analysis:** The observed effects (↑ROS, ↑$\\gamma$-H2AX, membrane damage, mitochondrial depolarization) are the hallmarks of direct cytotoxic injury. The lack of effect of the EGFR inhibitor confirms the action is independent of RTK signaling. This perfectly matches the \"toxin-like\" profile.\n- **Fraction Y Analysis:** The observed effects (↑EGFR, ↑ERK/AKT phosphorylation, ↑cyclin D1, ↑Bcl-2, ↑S-phase entry, ↓caspase-3 cleavage) are the hallmarks of growth factor signaling. The fact that an EGFR inhibitor abrogates these effects confirms the action is dependent on RTK signaling. This perfectly matches the \"growth factor-like\" profile.\n- **Verdict: Correct.** This option provides a set of results that is entirely consistent with the definitions and the key discriminator.\n\n**B. Fraction X induces robust EGFR phosphorylation and ERK activation accompanied by increased cyclin D1 and reduced apoptosis after genotoxic stress; these effects persist despite EGFR inhibition but are reversed by a pan-caspase inhibitor. Fraction Y causes marked ROS, $\\gamma$-H2AX foci, and membrane rupture that are prevented by EGFR inhibition.**\n\n- **Fraction X Analysis:** This description is internally contradictory. It states that Fraction X induces EGFR phosphorylation and downstream ERK activation, which are hallmarks of a growth factor-like effect. However, it then claims these effects persist despite EGFR inhibition. An EGFR inhibitor should block effects that are downstream of EGFR activation.\n- **Fraction Y Analysis:** This description is also contradictory. It assigns a damage profile (↑ROS, ↑$\\gamma$-H2AX, membrane rupture) characteristic of a toxin-like effector to Fraction Y, but then claims these effects are prevented by EGFR inhibition. The definition of a direct toxin-like injury is that it is independent of such receptor signaling.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** This option contains fundamental logical inconsistencies regarding the mechanism of action of the inhibitors.\n\n**C. Fraction X elevates secretion of proinflammatory cytokines from cholangiocytes, with no changes in RTK signaling or cell cycle regulators and no DNA damage. Fraction Y increases neutrophil migration in a transwell assay and induces p53 accumulation with increased apoptosis; both effects are blocked by EGFR inhibition.**\n\n- **Fraction X Analysis:** This describes an inflammatory, but not a directly cytotoxic, effector. The problem's definition of \"toxin-like\" specifies direct damage (membrane, mitochondrial, DNA), which this profile explicitly lacks (\"no DNA damage\").\n- **Fraction Y Analysis:** This describes a pro-apoptotic effect (↑p53, ↑apoptosis), which is the opposite of the defined \"growth factor-like\" effect (pro-survival, anti-apoptotic). A growth factor should promote proliferation, not cell death.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.** The described phenotypes for both fractions do not align with the definitions of \"toxin-like\" and \"growth factor-like\" provided in the problem statement.\n\n**D. Fraction X causes DNA interstrand crosslinking and bulky adduct formation with increased comet tail moments, p53 stabilization, and caspase-3 cleavage; EGFR inhibition does not alter these outcomes but a pan-caspase inhibitor transiently reduces cell death. Fraction Y induces immediate early gene expression and sustained ERK and AKT phosphorylation with increased cyclin D1 and Bcl-2 and decreased apoptosis under serum starvation; these effects are lost with EGFR inhibition and reproduced by epidermal growth factor as a positive control.**\n\n- **Fraction X Analysis:** The observed effects (specific DNA damage, ↑p53, ↑caspase-3 cleavage) are a clear signature of genotoxicity leading to apoptosis. The insensitivity to EGFR inhibition correctly identifies this as a direct, toxin-like action.\n- **Fraction Y Analysis:** The observed effects (↑ERK/AKT phosphorylation, ↑cyclin D1, ↑Bcl-2, ↓apoptosis) are a classic signature of a growth factor. The dependence on EGFR activity (effects lost with inhibitor) and mimicry by the natural ligand EGF as a positive control provide a robust confirmation of this classification. This perfectly matches the \"growth factor-like\" profile.\n- **Verdict: Correct.** This option, like option A, provides a set of results that is entirely consistent with the definitions and the key discriminator. It describes a slightly different flavor of genotoxicity for Fraction X and adds the methodologically sound detail of a positive control for Fraction Y, but the core logic is identical and correct.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBoth options A and D present scientifically sound and internally consistent scenarios that correctly distinguish a toxin-like fraction from a growth factor-like fraction based on the provided principles. Both correctly apply the key discriminator of EGFR inhibitor sensitivity. Therefore, both options A and D are correct answers to the question.",

It provides all necessary information and assumptions required for a formal derivation and numerical calculation in the field of epidemiology. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Population Attributable Fraction ($\\mathrm{PAF}$) in terms of the prevalence of an exposure ($p$) and the relative risk ($\\mathrm{RR}$) associated with that exposure. We will then compute its value using the provided data.\n\nFirst, let us define the key epidemiological terms.\nLet $E$ denote the exposure, which in this context is infection with *Clonorchis sinensis*, and let $\\bar{E}$ denote the absence of exposure.\nLet $D$ denote the disease, which is cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nThe incidence of the disease in the exposed population is denoted by $I_E$. This is the conditional probability of developing the disease given exposure, $P(D|E)$.\nThe incidence of the disease in the unexposed population is denoted by $I_{\\bar{E}}$. This is the conditional probability of developing the disease given no exposure, $P(D|\\bar{E})$.\nThe total incidence of the disease in the entire population is denoted by $I_{pop}$, which corresponds to the marginal probability $P(D)$.\n\nThe prevalence of the exposure in the population, $P(E)$, is given as $p$. Consequently, the proportion of the unexposed population, $P(\\bar{E})$, is $1-p$.\n\nThe Relative Risk ($\\mathrm{RR}$) is defined as the ratio of the incidence in the exposed group to the incidence in the unexposed group:\n$$ \\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{I_E}{I_{\\bar{E}}} $$\n\nThe Population Attributable Fraction ($\\mathrm{PAF}$) is defined as the proportion of all disease cases in the total population that is attributable to the exposure. It is the fraction by which the incidence in the population would be reduced if the exposure were eliminated. Mathematically, it is expressed as:\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_{\\bar{E}}}{I_{pop}} $$\nHere, $I_{pop} - I_{\\bar{E}}$ represents the excess incidence in the population due to the exposure, and we divide by the total population incidence, $I_{pop}$, to get the proportion.\n\nTo derive the $\\mathrm{PAF}$ in terms of $p$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$, we must first express $I_{pop}$ using the law of total probability. The overall incidence in the population is the weighted average of the incidences in the exposed and unexposed strata, where the weights are the proportions of the population in each stratum:\n$$ I_{pop} = P(D) = P(D|E) P(E) + P(D|\\bar{E}) P(\\bar{E}) $$\nSubstituting our epidemiological notation:\n$$ I_{pop} = I_E \\cdot p + I_{\\bar{E}} \\cdot (1-p) $$\n\nNow, we use the definition of $\\mathrm{RR}$ to express $I_E$ in terms of $I_{\\bar{E}}$ and $\\mathrm{RR}$:\n$$ I_E = \\mathrm{RR} \\cdot I_{\\bar{E}} $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $I_{pop}$:\n$$ I_{pop} = (\\mathrm{RR} \\cdot I_{\\bar{E}}) \\cdot p + I_{\\bar{E}} \\cdot (1-p) $$\nWe can factor out the baseline incidence, $I_{\\bar{E}}$:\n$$ I_{pop} = I_{\\bar{E}} [p \\cdot \\mathrm{RR} + (1-p)] $$\n\nNow we can substitute this expression for $I_{pop}$ back into the definition of $\\mathrm{PAF}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{I_{pop} - I_{\\bar{E}}}{I_{pop}} = 1 - \\frac{I_{\\bar{E}}}{I_{pop}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{I_{\\bar{E}}}{I_{\\bar{E}} [p \\cdot \\mathrm{RR} + (1-p)]} $$\nAssuming $I_{\\bar{E}} > 0$ (i.e., the disease can occur without the exposure, which is true for cholangiocarcinoma), we can cancel the $I_{\\bar{E}}$ term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{1}{p \\cdot \\mathrm{RR} + 1 - p} $$\nThis expression can be algebraically simplified. We can rearrange the denominator as $1 + p \\cdot \\mathrm{RR} - p = 1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)} $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)}{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)} - \\frac{1}{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1) - 1}{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PAF} = \\frac{p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)}{1 + p(\\mathrm{RR}-1)} $$\nThis is the required expression for the Population Attributable Fraction in terms of the prevalence of exposure $p$ and the relative risk $\\mathrm{RR}$.
