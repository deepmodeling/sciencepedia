In this setting, the Peptide-Spectrum Match (PSM) score is a continuous, higher-is-better metric derived from a probabilistic scoring function. The study aims to control the global error rate using the Target-Decoy Approach (TDA) under the assumption of equal-sized target and decoy search spaces and independently and identically distributed false matches across target and decoy.\n\nYou are provided with the cumulative numbers of target and decoy PSMs at or above a set of discrete score thresholds $s$:\n- For $s \\geq 95$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 120$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 0$.\n- For $s \\geq 90$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 310$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 2$.\n- For $s \\geq 85$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 590$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 7$.\n- For $s \\geq 80$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 920$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 13$.\n- For $s \\geq 75$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 1310$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 24$.\n- For $s \\geq 70$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 1780$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 36$.\n- For $s \\geq 65$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 2250$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 52$.\n- For $s \\geq 60$: $N_{\\mathrm{target}} = 2700$, $N_{\\mathrm{decoy}} = 73$.\n\nAdopt the following standard definitions for a concatenated Target-Decoy Approach in proteomics:\n- The estimated false discovery rate at threshold $s$ is $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}(s) = \\dfrac{N_{\\mathrm{decoy}}(S \\geq s)}{N_{\\mathrm{target}}(S \\geq s)}$.\n- The $q$-value at threshold $s$ is $q(s) = \\min_{u \\leq s} \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}(u)$, that is, the minimal estimated false discovery rate among all thresholds that would include PSMs with score at least $s$.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It describes a standard application of the Target-Decoy Approach (TDA) for controlling the False Discovery Rate (FDR) in mass spectrometry-based proteomics. The provided definitions for estimated FDR and $q$-value are standard in the field. The data are consistent and sufficient to answer the posed questions. Therefore, I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe objective is to determine the smallest score threshold $s_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ from the provided list such that the associated $q$-value is less than or equal to a target rate of $1\\%$, i.e., $q(s_{\\mathrm{cut}}) \\leq 0.01$. The problem specifies that if multiple thresholds qualify, we must select the one with the lowest score value, which corresponds to the least stringent criterion.\n\nThe solution process involves three steps:\n1.  For each given score threshold $s$, calculate the estimated False Discovery Rate, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}(s)$.\n2.  For each threshold $s$, calculate the corresponding $q$-value, $q(s)$, using the provided definition.\n3.  Identify the set of thresholds that satisfy the condition $q(s) \\leq 0.01$ and select the one with the lowest score value.\n\nLet $S$ denote the PSM score.

As a result, the calculation of the $q$-value simplifies to $q(s) = \\widehat{\\mathrm{FDR}}(s)$ for all thresholds $s$ in the provided list.\n\nStep 3: Select the cutoff score $s_{\\mathrm{cut}}$.\nWe need to find the smallest score threshold $s_{\\mathrm{cut}}$ such that $q(s_{\\mathrm{cut}}) \\leq 0.01$. Let's examine the computed $q$-values:\n- $q(95) = 0 \\leq 0.01$ (Condition met)\n- $q(90) = \\frac{2}{310} \\approx 0.00645 \\leq 0.01$ (Condition met)\n- $q(85) = \\frac{7}{590} \\approx 0.01186 > 0.01$ (Condition not met)\n- $q(80) = \\frac{13}{920} \\approx 0.01413 > 0.01$ (Condition not met)\n- ... and so on for all lower scores, as the $q$-values are even larger.\n\nThe set of score thresholds that satisfy the condition $q(s) \\leq 0.01$ is $\\{90, 95\\}$.\nThe problem requires us to choose the least stringent threshold, which corresponds to the lowest score value among the qualifying thresholds.\nComparing the values in the set $\\{90, 95\\}$, the lowest score is $90$.\nTherefore, the desired cutoff score is $s_{\\mathrm{cut}} = 90$.",

This cumulative probability is given by:\n$$ p = P(X \\ge k) = \\sum_{i=k}^{\\min(n, K)} P(X=i) = \\sum_{i=k}^{\\min(n, K)} \\frac{\\binom{K}{i} \\binom{N-K}{n-i}}{\\binom{N}{n}} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the denominator $\\binom{N}{n}$, which is constant for all tests:\n$$ \\binom{40}{8} = \\frac{40!}{8!(40-8)!} = 76904685 $$\n\nNow, we compute the raw $p$-value for each of the four GO terms.\n\n1.  **GO: heme metabolic process**: $K = 6$, $k = 4$.\n    The $p$-value is $p_1 = P(X \\ge 4)$ for $X \\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(N=40, K=6, n=8)$.\n    $$ p_1 = \\sum_{i=4}^{6} \\frac{\\binom{6}{i}\\binom{34}{8-i}}{\\binom{40}{8}} = \\frac{\\binom{6}{4}\\binom{34}{4} + \\binom{6}{5}\\binom{34}{3} + \\binom{6}{6}\\binom{34}{2}}{76904685} $$\n    $$ p_1 = \\frac{(15)(46376) + (6)(5984) + (1)(561)}{76904685} = \\frac{695640 + 35904 + 561}{76904685} = \\frac{732105}{76904685} \\approx 0.00951964 $$\n\n2.  **GO: glycolytic process**: $K = 10$, $k = 5$.\n    The $p$-value is $p_2 = P(X \\ge 5)$ for $X \\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(N=40, K=10, n=8)$.\n    $$ p_2 = \\sum_{i=5}^{8} \\frac{\\binom{10}{i}\\binom{30}{8-i}}{\\binom{40}{8}} = \\frac{\\binom{10}{5}\\binom{30}{3} + \\binom{10}{6}\\binom{30}{2} + \\binom{10}{7}\\binom{30}{1} + \\binom{10}{8}\\binom{30}{0}}{76904685} $$\n    $$ p_2 = \\frac{(252)(4060) + (210)(435) + (120)(30) + (45)(1)}{76904685} = \\frac{1023120 + 91350 + 3600 + 45}{76904685} = \\frac{1118115}{76904685} \\approx 0.0145389 $$\n\n3.  **GO: microtubule-based movement**: $K = 5$, $k = 1$.\n    The $p$-value is $p_3 = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$ for $X \\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(N=40, K=5, n=8)$.\n    $$ p_3 = 1 - \\frac{\\binom{5}{0}\\binom{35}{8}}{\\binom{40}{8}} = 1 - \\frac{(1)(23535820)}{76904685} \\approx 1 - 0.3060373 = 0.6939627 $$\n\n4.  **GO: mitochondrial translation**: $K = 12$, $k = 4$.\n    The $p$-value is $p_4 = P(X \\ge 4)$ for $X \\sim \\text{Hypergeometric}(N=40, K=12, n=8)$.\n    $$ p_4 = \\sum_{i=4}^{8} \\frac{\\binom{12}{i}\\binom{28}{8-i}}{\\binom{40}{8}} = \\frac{\\binom{12}{4}\\binom{28}{4} + \\binom{12}{5}\\binom{28}{3} + \\binom{12}{6}\\binom{28}{2} + \\binom{12}{7}\\binom{28}{1} + \\binom{12}{8}\\binom{28}{0}}{76904685} $$\n    $$ p_4 = \\frac{(495)(20475) + (792)(3276) + (924)(378) + (792)(28) + (495)(1)}{76904685} = \\frac{13101660}{76904685} \\approx 0.1703631 $$\n\nWith the four raw $p$-values calculated, we now apply the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to the set of $m=4$ tests.\n1.  Order the raw $p$-values from smallest to largest, noting their original identity:\n    - $p_{(1)} = p_1 \\approx 0.00951964$ (heme)\n    - $p_{(2)} = p_2 \\approx 0.0145389$ (glycolytic)\n    - $p_{(3)} = p_4 \\approx 0.1703631$ (mitochondrial)\n    - $p_{(4)} = p_3 \\approx 0.6939627$ (microtubule)\nThe rank of each $p$-value is its position $i$ in this sorted list.\n\n2.  Calculate the adjusted $p$-value for each rank. The BH adjusted $p$-value for the test with rank $i$, denoted $p_{adj,(i)}$, is calculated by starting from the largest rank and enforcing monotonicity.\n    The rule is: $p_{adj,(i)} = \\min\\left( p_{(i)} \\times \\frac{m}{i}, p_{adj,(i+1)} \\right)$, with the base case $p_{adj,(m)} = p_{(m)}$.\n\n    - For rank $i=4$:\n      $p_{adj,(4)} = p_{(4)} \\times \\frac{4}{4} = 0.6939627 \\times 1 = 0.6939627$.\n    - For rank $i=3$:\n      The intermediate value is $p_{(3)} \\times \\frac{4}{3} = 0.1703631 \\times \\frac{4}{3} \\approx 0.2271508$.\n      $p_{adj,(3)} = \\min(0.2271508, p_{adj,(4)}) = \\min(0.2271508, 0.6939627) = 0.2271508$.\n    - For rank $i=2$:\n      The intermediate value is $p_{(2)} \\times \\frac{4}{2} = 0.0145389 \\times 2 = 0.0290778$.\n      $p_{adj,(2)} = \\min(0.0290778, p_{adj,(3)}) = \\min(0.0290778, 0.2271508) = 0.0290778$.\n    - For rank $i=1$:\n      The intermediate value is $p_{(1)} \\times \\frac{4}{1} = 0.00951964 \\times 4 = 0.03807856$.\n      $p_{adj,(1)} = \\min(0.03807856, p_{adj,(2)}) = \\min(0.03807856, 0.0290778) = 0.0290778$.\n\nThe inquiry is for the adjusted $p$-value for **GO: glycolytic process**. This term's raw $p$-value was $p_2$, which holds the rank $i=2$ in the sorted list. Its adjusted $p$-value is therefore $p_{adj,(2)}$.\n$$ p_{\\text{adj, glycolytic}} = p_{adj,(2)} \\approx 0.0290778 $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $0.02908$.",
