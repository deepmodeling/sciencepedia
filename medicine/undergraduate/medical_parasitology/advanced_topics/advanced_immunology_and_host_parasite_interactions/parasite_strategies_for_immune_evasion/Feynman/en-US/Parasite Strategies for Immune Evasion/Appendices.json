There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The scenario describing a parasite protease cleaving IgG is a recognized mechanism in medical parasitology, and the application of Michaelis-Menten kinetics is the standard approach for modeling such a system.\n\nWe begin by stating the Michaelis–Menten equation, which describes the rate of reaction, $v$, for an enzyme-catalyzed process under steady-state assumptions. The rate of substrate consumption, in this case, the cleavage of intact Immunoglobulin G ($IgG$), is given by:\n$$v = -\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the substrate concentration (here, $[IgG]$), $t$ is time, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, and $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction rate. The maximum rate is related to the total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ and the turnover number $k_{cat}$ by the equation $V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_T$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{max}$ into the rate law gives:\n$$-\\frac{d[S]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{cat}[E]_T[S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nThis is the differential equation governing the concentration of intact IgG over time. To find the time required for a specific change in concentration, we must integrate this equation. We can rearrange the equation to separate the variables $[S]$ and $t$:\n$$dt = -\\frac{K_M + [S]}{k_{cat}[E]_T[S]} d[S]$$\nThis can be expanded into two terms for easier integration:\n$$dt = -\\left( \\frac{K_M}{k_{cat}[E]_T[S]} + \\frac{[S]}{k_{cat}[E]_T[S]} \\right) d[S] = -\\frac{1}{k_{cat}[E]_T} \\left( \\frac{K_M}{[S]} + 1 \\right) d[S]$$\nWe now integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate time from $t=0$ to a final time $t$, and the substrate concentration from its initial value $[S]_0$ to its final value $[S]$:\n$$\\int_0^t d\\tau = -\\frac{1}{k_{cat}[E]_T} \\int_{[S]_0}^{[S]} \\left( \\frac{K_M}{[\\Sigma]} + 1 \\right) d[\\Sigma]$$\nwhere $\\tau$ and $[\\Sigma]$ are dummy variables of integration.\n\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$t = -\\frac{1}{k_{cat}[E]_T} \\left[ K_M \\ln([\\Sigma]) + [\\Sigma] \\right]_{[S]_0}^{[S]}$$\n$$t = -\\frac{1}{k_{cat}[E]_T} \\left( (K_M \\ln([S]) + [S]) - (K_M \\ln([S]_0) + [S]_0) \\right)$$\nRearranging the terms for clarity and combining the logarithms, we obtain the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$t = \\frac{([S]_0 - [S]) + K_M \\ln\\left(\\frac{[S]_0}{[S]}\\right)}{k_{cat}[E]_T}$$\nThis is the required expression for the time $t$ to reduce the substrate concentration from $[S]_0$ to $[S]$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values.\nThe substrate is IgG, so $[S] = [IgG]$.\nGiven parameters:\nInitial IgG concentration, $[IgG]_0 = 50\\,\\mu\\text{M}$\nFinal IgG concentration, $[IgG] = 25\\,\\mu\\text{M}$\nMichaelis constant, $K_M = 5\\,\\mu\\text{M}$\nTurnover number, $k_{cat} = 10\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\nTotal enzyme concentration, $[E]_T = 1.0\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nFor consistency in units, we convert all concentrations to micromolar ($\\mu\\text{M}$):\n$[E]_T = 1.0\\,\\text{nM} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 0.001\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator term:\n$$([IgG]_0 - [IgG]) = (50\\,\\mu\\text{M} - 25\\,\\mu\\text{M}) = 25\\,\\mu\\text{M}$$\n$$K_M \\ln\\left(\\frac{[IgG]_0}{[IgG]}\\right) = (5\\,\\mu\\text{M}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{50\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{25\\,\\mu\\text{M}}\\right) = (5\\,\\mu\\text{M}) \\ln(2)$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69315$, this term is approximately $5 \\times 0.69315\\,\\mu\\text{M} \\approx 3.46575\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nThe sum in the numerator is:\n$25\\,\\mu\\text{M} + 3.46575\\,\\mu\\text{M} = 28.46575\\,\\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator term, which represents $V_{max}$:\n$$V_{max} = k_{cat}[E]_T = (10\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.001\\,\\mu\\text{M}) = 0.01\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the time $t$:\n$$t = \\frac{28.46575\\,\\mu\\text{M}}{0.01\\,\\mu\\text{M}\\cdot\\text{s}^{-1}} = 2846.575\\,\\text{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t \\approx 2850\\,\\text{s}$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $2.85 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{s}$.

We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system describes the stochastic switching of a single gene between two states, \"on\" and \"off\", modeled as a continuous-time Markov chain. Let $P_{on}(t)$ and $P_{off}(t)$ represent the fraction of cells with the gene in the \"on\" and \"off\" states, respectively, at time $t$. The transition rates are given as constants: $k_{on}$ for the \"off\" $\\to$ \"on\" transition and $k_{off}$ for the \"on\" $\\to$ \"off\" transition.\n\nThe time evolution of the probabilities $P_{on}(t)$ and $P_{off}(t)$ is governed by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations, known as the forward or master equations. These equations describe the net change in the population of each state as the balance of flux into and out of that state.\n\nFor the \"on\" state, the population fraction $P_{on}(t)$ increases due to cells switching from \"off\" to \"on\" at a rate proportional to the fraction of cells in the \"off\" state, $k_{on}P_{off}(t)$. It decreases due to cells switching from \"on\" to \"off\" at a rate proportional to the fraction of cells in the \"on\" state, $k_{off}P_{on}(t)$. The rate of change of $P_{on}(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_{on}(t)}{dt} = k_{on}P_{off}(t) - k_{off}P_{on}(t)\n$$\n\nSimilarly, for the \"off\" state, the population fraction $P_{off}(t)$ increases due to cells switching from \"on\" to \"off\" ($k_{off}P_{on}(t)$) and decreases due to cells switching from \"off\" to \"on\" ($k_{on}P_{off}(t)$). The rate of change of $P_{off}(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_{off}(t)}{dt} = k_{off}P_{on}(t) - k_{on}P_{off}(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the total probability is conserved, i.e., $P_{on}(t) + P_{off}(t) = 1$ for all $t \\geq 0$. We can verify that our system of equations is consistent with this constraint by summing them:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( P_{on}(t) + P_{off}(t) \\right) = \\frac{dP_{on}(t)}{dt} + \\frac{dP_{off}(t)}{dt} = (k_{on}P_{off}(t) - k_{off}P_{on}(t)) + (k_{off}P_{on}(t) - k_{on}P_{off}(t)) = 0\n$$\nThis confirms that $P_{on}(t) + P_{off}(t)$ is a constant. Given the initial conditions $P_{on}(0) = p_{0}$ and $P_{off}(0) = 1 - p_{0}$, the constant is $p_{0} + (1 - p_{0}) = 1$.\n\nTo solve for $P_{on}(t)$, we can use the conservation law to eliminate $P_{off}(t)$ from the first differential equation.

The general solution is the sum of a particular solution, $P_{on,p}(t)$, and the solution to the homogeneous equation, $P_{on,h}(t)$.\n\nThe particular solution can be found by assuming a steady state where $\\frac{dP_{on}}{dt} = 0$. This gives the equilibrium fraction, which we denote as $P_{on,eq}$:\n$$\n0 = k_{on} - (k_{on} + k_{off})P_{on,eq} \\implies P_{on,eq} = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\n$$\nSo, a particular solution is $P_{on,p}(t) = P_{on,eq}$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_{on,h}(t)}{dt} + (k_{on} + k_{off})P_{on,h}(t) = 0\n$$\nThis has the solution $P_{on,h}(t) = C \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t)$ for some constant $C$.\n\nThe general solution for $P_{on}(t)$ is the sum of the particular and homogeneous solutions:\n$$\nP_{on}(t) = P_{on,p}(t) + P_{on,h}(t) = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + C \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t)\n$$\nTo determine the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition $P_{on}(0) = p_{0}$:\n$$\np_{0} = P_{on}(0) = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + C \\exp(0) = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + C\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = p_{0} - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the general solution gives the explicit time-dependent expression for $P_{on}(t)$:\n$$\nP_{on}(t) = \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + \\left(p_{0} - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t)\n$$\n\nNow we find the expression for $P_{off}(t)$ using the conservation relation $P_{off}(t) = 1 - P_{on}(t)$:\n$$\nP_{off}(t) = 1 - \\left[ \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + \\left(p_{0} - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP_{off}(t) = \\left(1 - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) - \\left(p_{0} - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t)\n$$\nThe first term simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} = \\frac{k_{on} + k_{off} - k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\n$$\nThis is the equilibrium fraction for the \"off\" state, $P_{off,eq}$.\nThe coefficient of the exponential term can be rewritten in terms of the initial condition for the \"off\" state, $P_{off}(0) = 1 - p_{0}$:\n$$\n-\\left(p_{0} - \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) = -p_{0} + \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} = (1 - p_{0}) - 1 + \\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} = (1 - p_{0}) - \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\n$$\nSo, the final expression for $P_{off}(t)$ is:\n$$\nP_{off}(t) = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on} + k_{off}} + \\left((1 - p_{0}) - \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on} + k_{off}}\\right) \\exp(-(k_{on} + k_{off})t)\n$$\nThis expression is symmetric in form to the one for $P_{on}(t)$, with \"on\" and \"off\" indices and initial conditions interchanged, as expected.\n\nThe derived expressions for $P_{on}(t)$ and $P_{off}(t)$ represent the complete solution to the problem. They describe how the fraction of cells in each state evolves from an initial arbitrary distribution $(p_{0}, 1-p_{0})$ towards a stable equilibrium distribution $(\\frac{k_{on}}{k_{on}+k_{off}}, \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}+k_{off}})$, with a characteristic relaxation time of $\\tau = 1/(k_{on} + k_{off})$.",
