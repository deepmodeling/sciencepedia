            "problem": "A protozoan parasite undergoing intracellular replication within human hepatocytes is initially constrained by innate immune mechanisms (for example, interferon-mediated restriction), resulting in an effective per capita replication rate $r$ for the population of infected cells. Once the adaptive immune response is engaged, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize and lyse infected cells. Let $I(t)$ denote the number of infected cells at time $t$, let $E$ denote the dimensionless CTL frequency (the fraction of CTLs among lymphocytes), and let $k$ denote the per capita lysis rate constant, such that CTL-mediated killing scales as mass action with term $k E I$. Assume the dynamics of infected cells are governed by the ordinary differential equation\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = r I - k E I.$$\nUsing first principles of exponential growth and mass-action killing, derive the minimal CTL frequency $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$ that guarantees control of infection, defined as a monotonic decline of $I(t)$ for all $I(t) > 0$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimal cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) frequency, denoted as $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$, that guarantees the control of an intracellular parasitic infection. The dynamics of the number of infected cells, $I(t)$, are provided by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = r I - k E I\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the effective per capita replication rate of the infected cell population, $k$ is the per capita lysis rate constant mediated by CTLs, $E$ is the dimensionless CTL frequency, and $I$ is the number of infected cells. All parameters $r$ and $k$ are inherently positive constants, representing a biological rate of production and clearance, respectively.\n\nThe condition for \"control of infection\" is explicitly defined in the problem statement as a \"monotonic decline of $I(t)$ for all $I(t) > 0$\". A monotonic decline of a function implies that its first derivative is strictly negative. Applying this definition to $I(t)$, the mathematical condition for control is:\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt}  0\n$$\nTo find the condition on $E$ that satisfies this requirement, we substitute the given differential equation into the inequality:\n$$\nr I - k E I  0\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for any positive number of infected cells, i.e., for all $I > 0$. We can factor out the term $I$ from the left-hand side of the inequality:\n$$\nI (r - k E)  0\n$$\nGiven that $I > 0$, the term $I$ is a positive quantity. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $I$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign. This yields:\n$$\nr - k E  0\n$$\nTo determine the required CTL frequency $E$, we solve this linear inequality for $E$. Adding $k E$ to both sides, we get:\n$$\nr  k E\n$$\nSince the lysis rate constant $k$ is a positive physical parameter ($k>0$), we can divide both sides by $k$ without altering the inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{k}  E\n$$\nThis inequality, $E > \\frac{r}{k}$, provides the condition that the CTL frequency $E$ must satisfy to ensure that the infected cell population $I(t)$ declines over time. The ratio $\\frac{r}{k}$ represents a critical threshold. If the CTL frequency is above this value, the rate of CTL-mediated killing ($kEI$) is greater than the rate of production of new infected cells ($rI$), resulting in a net decrease in the infected cell population.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal CTL frequency, $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$, that guarantees control. This quantity corresponds to the critical threshold value that separates the regime of infection growth ($E  \\frac{r}{k}$) from the regime of infection control ($E > \\frac{r}{k}$). This boundary value is the greatest lower bound (infimum) of the set of all frequencies $E$ that ensure control. Therefore, the minimal frequency is defined by the equality case:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{r}{k}\n$$\nAt this specific frequency, $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$, representing an equilibrium where the infection is held in check but not cleared. Any frequency $E$ strictly greater than $E_{\\mathrm{min}}$ will lead to the monotonic decline stipulated in the problem. Thus, $E_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{r}{k}$ is the minimal required threshold for initiating control.",

This is $P(N|I^c)$. We can find this using the complement rule. For a person who is not infected, the test can either be positive (a false positive) or negative (a true negative). Therefore, the sum of their probabilities must be 1:\n  $$\n  P(P|I^c) + P(N|I^c) = 1\n  $$\n  We know $P(P|I^c) = FPR$.

We can use Bayes' theorem to derive this:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(I|P) = \\frac{P(P|I)P(I)}{P(P)}\n$$\nTo use this formula, we first need to find the overall probability of a positive test, $P(P)$, using the law of total probability.

I will proceed with the full solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem states that the antibody titer $T(t)$ follows first-order decay kinetics. This means the rate of change of the titer is directly proportional to the current titer. Mathematically, this is expressed as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -k T(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive constant fractional decay rate. The negative sign indicates that the titer is decreasing over time.\n\nTo find the functional form of $T(t)$, we solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{T} = -k \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. We integrate the titer from its initial value $T(0) = T_0$ at time $t=0$ to its value $T(t)$ at a general time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^{T(t)} \\frac{1}{T'} \\, dT' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, d\\tau\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln|T'|]_{T_0}^{T(t)} = [-k\\tau]_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince antibody titer is a positive quantity, we can drop the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T_0) = -kt\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write this as:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{T(t)}{T_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $T(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{T(t)}{T_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis yields the general functional form for first-order decay:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks to relate this to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t = t_{1/2}$, the titer is half of its initial value, i.e., $T(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{T_0}{2}$. Substituting this into our derived equation:\n$$\n\\frac{T_0}{2} = T_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $T_0$ (which is non-zero):\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nThus, the decay constant $k$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ back into our equation for $T(t)$, we obtain the functional form of $T(t)$ in terms of the half-life, which was the first part of the request:\n$$\nT(t) = T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in the intuitive form $T(t) = T_0 \\cdot 2^{-t/t_{1/2}}$.\n\nThe second part of the request is to find an expression for the time $t_{\\text{prot}}$ at which the titer reaches the protective threshold $T^*$. We set $T(t_{\\text{prot}}) = T^*$:\n$$\nT^* = T_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t_{\\text{prot}}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{\\text{prot}}$, we first divide by $T_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{T^*}{T_0} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t_{\\text{prot}}\\right)\n$$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{T^*}{T_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t_{\\text{prot}}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\n-\\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T^*}\\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} t_{\\text{prot}}\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{\\text{prot}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{T_0}{T^*}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the duration of protection.\n\nThe third part is to compute $t_{\\text{prot}}$ for the given values: $T_0 = 640$, $T^* = 80$, and $t_{1/2} = 21$ days.\nFirst, we compute the ratio of the initial titer to the threshold titer:\n$$\n\\frac{T_0}{T^*} = \\frac{640}{80} = 8\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the derived expression for $t_{\\text{prot}}$:\n$$\nt_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{21 \\, \\text{days}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(8)\n$$\nWe can simplify $\\ln(8)$ by recognizing that $8 = 2^3$. Therefore, $\\ln(8) = \\ln(2^3) = 3 \\ln(2)$.\nSubstituting this into the equation:\n$$\nt_{\\text{prot}} = \\frac{21 \\, \\text{days}}{\\ln(2)} \\left(3 \\ln(2)\\right)\n$$\nThe terms $\\ln(2)$ cancel out, leading to a simple calculation:\n$$\nt_{\\text{prot}} = 21 \\cdot 3 \\, \\text{days} = 63 \\, \\text{days}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The exact answer is $63$. To express this to three significant figures, we write it as $63.0$.",
