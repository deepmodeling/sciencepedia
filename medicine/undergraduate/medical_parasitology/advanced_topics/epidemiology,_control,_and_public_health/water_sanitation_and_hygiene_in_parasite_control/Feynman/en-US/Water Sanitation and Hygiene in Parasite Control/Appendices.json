The survival fraction for organism $j \\in \\{G, C\\}$ through filter $X \\in \\{N, A\\}$, denoted $s_{j,X}$, is the probability that the organism passes through the filter.

Analysis of the Nominal Filter (Filter N)**\n\nFor Filter N, the pore size $P_N$ is a random variable. The survival of an organism of diameter $D_j$ occurs if $D_j \\le P_N$, or equivalently, if the difference $\\delta_j = D_j - P_N$ is less than or equal to $0$. Since $D_j$ and $P_N$ are independent normal random variables, their difference $\\delta_j$ is also a normal random variable.\nThe distribution of $\\delta_j$ is $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\delta_j}, \\sigma_{\\delta_j}^2)$, where:\n$$\\mu_{\\delta_j} = E[D_j - P_N] = \\mu_j - \\mu_P$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\delta_j}^2 = \\mathrm{Var}(D_j - P_N) = \\mathrm{Var}(D_j) + \\mathrm{Var}(P_N) = \\sigma_j^2 + \\sigma_P^2$$\nThe survival fraction is $s_{j,N} = P(\\delta_j \\le 0)$.\n\nFor Giardia:\n$$\\mu_{\\delta_G} = \\mu_G - \\mu_P = 10.0 - 3.5 = 6.5$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\delta_G}^2 = \\sigma_G^2 + \\sigma_P^2 = (1.5)^2 + (0.7)^2 = 2.25 + 0.49 = 2.74$$\nThe survival fraction is:\n$$s_{G,N} = P(\\delta_G \\le 0) = P\\left(\\frac{\\delta_G - \\mu_{\\delta_G}}{\\sigma_{\\delta_G}} \\le \\frac{0 - \\mu_{\\delta_G}}{\\sigma_{\\delta_G}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-6.5}{\\sqrt{2.74}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-3.9267)$$\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, $s_{G,N} \\approx 4.301 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\nFor Cryptosporidium:\n$$\\mu_{\\delta_C} = \\mu_C - \\mu_P = 5.0 - 3.5 = 1.5$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\delta_C}^2 = \\sigma_C^2 + \\sigma_P^2 = (0.5)^2 + (0.7)^2 = 0.25 + 0.49 = 0.74$$\nThe survival fraction is:\n$$s_{C,N} = P(\\delta_C \\le 0) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-1.5}{\\sqrt{0.74}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(-1.7437)$$\nUsing a standard normal table or calculator, $s_{C,N} \\approx 0.04060$.\n\nThe mixture survival fraction for Filter N is:\n$$S_N = w_G s_{G,N} + w_C s_{C,N} \\approx (0.3)(4.301 \\times 10^{-5}) + (0.7)(0.04060)$$\n$$S_N \\approx 1.2903 \\times 10^{-5} + 0.02842 \\approx 0.028433$$\nThe Log Removal Value for Filter N is:\n$$\\mathrm{LRV}_N = -\\log_{10}(S_N) \\approx -\\log_{10}(0.028433) \\approx 1.5462$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Improvement in Log Removal**\n\nThe improvement is the difference in LRV:\n$$\\Delta = \\mathrm{LRV}_{A} - \\mathrm{LRV}_{N} \\approx 4.6455 - 1.5462 = 3.0993$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures, the result is $3.10$.\n\n**4. Justification of Scientific Limitations**\n\nThe calculation above relies on a highly idealized model. The primary limitations, in the context of interpreting nominal versus absolute pore size ratings, are as follows:\n\n- **Oversimplification of Removal Mechanisms:** The model assumes removal occurs exclusively through sieving ($D > P$). In practice, depth filters, which are typically nominally rated, rely on a combination of mechanisms. These include inertial impaction, interception, and, crucially for microbial removal, adsorption via electrostatic and van der Waals forces. These mechanisms can remove particles much smaller than the average pore size. The model's neglect of these phenomena likely underestimates the true performance of the nominal filter (Filter N), meaning the calculated $s_{j,N}$ is artificially high and $\\mathrm{LRV}_N$ is artificially low.\n\n- **Interpretation of 'Pore Size':** For a nominally rated depth filter, there is no single 'pore' a particle encounters. The filter is a complex, tortuous matrix of fibers. The problem models this by treating the encountered pore size as a single draw from a normal distribution. This does not capture the reality of a particle navigating a path with multiple constrictions. A particle might pass an initial wider opening only to be captured by a smaller one deeper in the filter. Thus, the probability of passage is not a single-event probability. For an absolute-rated membrane filter, the 'pore' is a more well-defined physical channel, and the model of a maximum pore size ($p_0$) is a more reasonable, albeit still idealized, representation of its function under specific test conditions (e.g., bubble point test). Standard test definitions for absolute ratings (e.g., ASTM F838) are based on demonstrating a very high retention efficiency (e.g., $10^7$ reduction of $0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ *Brevundimonas diminuta* for sterilizing-grade filters), which is a performance-based, not purely geometric, standard.\n\n- **Geometric Idealization:** The model assumes spherical particles and circular pores. Giardia cysts are typically ovoid, and Cryptosporidium oocysts are nearly spherical. The pores in a depth filter are highly irregular. The condition $D > P$ is a simplification that ignores particle orientation and a pore's complex three-dimensional geometry, which can affect passage.\n\nIn summary, the pure sieving model provides a first-order approximation but misrepresents the dominant capture physics in a nominal depth filter and oversimplifies the nature of both filter types' ratings. The calculated $\\Delta$ should be seen as an estimate based on a purely geometric exclusion framework, not a comprehensive prediction of real-world performance.",

The effluent concentration can be calculated by rearranging the definition: $C_{out} = C_{in} \\cdot 10^{-LRV_{total}}$.\n\nThe problem describes a treatment train consisting of coagulation–flocculation–sedimentation (C-F-S), rapid sand filtration, and UV disinfection. It is a critical, established fact that chlorination, at the doses used in drinking water treatment, is ineffective against *Cryptosporidium* oocysts. Therefore, the $LRV$ for chlorination in this context is $LRV_{Cl_2} = 0$.\n\n**A. Optimized Steady-State Conditions**\n\nUnder optimized conditions, the stage performances are:\n-   $LRV_{C-F-S, opt} = 1.2$\n-   $LRV_{filt, opt} = 2.0$\n-   $LRV_{UV, opt} = 1.8$\n\nThe total $LRV$ for *Cryptosporidium* is the sum of these values:\n$$LRV_{total, opt} = LRV_{C-F-S, opt} + LRV_{filt, opt} + LRV_{UV, opt}$$\n$$LRV_{total, opt} = 1.2 + 2.0 + 1.8 = 5.0$$\n\nWith an influent concentration $C_{in} = 5$ oocysts/L, the finished water concentration $C_{out}$ is:\n$$C_{out, opt} = C_{in} \\cdot 10^{-LRV_{total, opt}}$$\n$$C_{out, opt} = (5 \\text{ oocysts/L}) \\cdot 10^{-5.0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ oocysts/L}$$\nThis is equivalent to $1$ oocyst per $20,000$ liters of water.\n\n**B. Turbidity Spike Event (No Operational Changes)**\n\nDuring the turbidity spike, with coagulation destabilized, the stage performances degrade to:\n-   $LRV_{C-F-S, deg} = 0.4$\n-   $LRV_{filt, deg} = 0.8$\n-   $LRV_{UV, deg} = 1.8$ (performance stated as unchanged)\n\nThe total $LRV$ under these degraded conditions is:\n$$LRV_{total, deg} = LRV_{C-F-S, deg} + LRV_{filt, deg} + LRV_{UV, deg}$$\n$$LRV_{total, deg} = 0.4 + 0.8 + 1.8 = 3.0$$\n\nAssuming the influent concentration $C_{in}$ remains at $5$ oocysts/L, the finished water concentration is:\n$$C_{out, deg} = C_{in} \\cdot 10^{-LRV_{total, deg}}$$\n$$C_{out, deg} = (5 \\text{ oocysts/L}) \\cdot 10^{-3.0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ oocysts/L} = 0.005 \\text{ oocysts/L}$$\nThis is equivalent to $1$ oocyst per $200$ liters of water.\n\n**C. Interpretation**\n\nThe turbidity spike causes the total parasite removal capability of the plant to decrease from $LRV_{total, opt} = 5.0$ to $LRV_{total, deg} = 3.0$. This is a drop of $2.0$ log units. Since the log scale is base-$10$, this means that the fraction of pathogens passing through the treatment system increases by a factor of $10^2 = 100$.\n\nConsequently, the effluent concentration of *Cryptosporidium* oocysts increases from $5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ oocysts/L to $5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ oocysts/L, a $100$-fold increase. This represents a significant and acute increase in the public health risk, as the infectious dose for *Cryptosporidium* is low.\n\n### Task 2: Evaluation of Operational Responses\n\nThe goal is to select the operational response that best protects the total $LRV$ and minimizes the risk of *Cryptosporidium* breakthrough. This requires applying fundamental principles of water treatment process control.\n\n**A. Immediately reduce the filtration loading rate by $25\\%$, retune coagulant dose and pH to restore stable floc formation, backwash the worst-performing filter with air scour and keep it on filter-to-waste for $15$ minutes during ripening, and temporarily increase the UV dose to its validated setting yielding $2.3$-log inactivation; do not rely on increased chlorination for Cryptosporidium control.**\n\nThis option presents a comprehensive, multi-barrier strategy.\n-   `retune coagulant dose and pH`: This is the most critical action. The problem states there is under-dosing. Correcting this addresses the root cause of the C-F-S and filtration performance degradation, aiming to restore $LRV_{C-F-S}$ and $LRV_{filt}$.\n-   `reduce the filtration loading rate`: Lowering the hydraulic velocity through the filters improves their particle capture efficiency, which would increase $LRV_{filt}$. This is a standard defensive measure during an upset.\n-   `backwash the worst-performing filter... with filter-to-waste`: This removes a failing filter from service and correctly manages the subsequent high-risk ripening period by diverting the initial, poor-quality filtrate to waste, preventing a concentrated pulse of pathogens from entering the treated water supply.\n-   `increase the UV dose to... 2.3-log inactivation`: This enhances the final, robust barrier against *Cryptosporidium*. Increasing the $LRV_{UV}$ from $1.8$ to $2.3$ provides an immediate gain of $0.5$-log protection, compensating for the temporary lapse in physical removal.\n-   `do not rely on increased chlorination`: This acknowledges the scientific fact of *Cryptosporidium*'s high chlorine resistance.\n\nThis strategy is proactive, addresses the root cause, mitigates immediate threats, and enhances downstream barriers.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Maintain current coagulant settings to avoid over-dosing; raise the free chlorine residual from $1.0$ mg/L to $2.5$ mg/L; keep all filters in service at normal loading rates to meet demand; do not use filter-to-waste.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally flawed.\n-   `Maintain current coagulant settings`: This ignores the primary indication of a process failure (\"under-dosing\"). This ensures the physical removal barriers (C-F-S and filtration) remain compromised.\n-   `raise the free chlorine residual`: This is an ineffective measure against *Cryptosporidium* and provides a false sense of security. The $LRV_{Cl_2}$ for *Cryptosporidium* is essentially zero.\n-   `keep all filters in service at normal loading rates`: This allows a failing process to continue operating, risking massive pathogen breakthrough, especially when filter effluent turbidity is already elevated.\n\nThis strategy fails to address the actual problem and relies on an ineffective control.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Bypass sedimentation to speed response and reduce sludge carryover; increase filtration rate by $20\\%$ to maintain supply; keep UV dose unchanged and depend on higher chlorine residual to compensate.**\n\nThis option describes a series of actions that would be catastrophic.\n-   `Bypass sedimentation`: Sedimentation is a major removal step ($LRV_{C-F-S, opt} = 1.2$). Bypassing it would massively increase the solids and pathogen load on the filters, causing them to fail rapidly and completely.\n-   `increase filtration rate by 20%`: This would further decrease filter efficiency by increasing hydraulic shear and reducing contact time, guaranteeing a collapse of $LRV_{filt}$.\n-   `depend on higher chlorine residual`: As established, this is irrelevant for *Cryptosporidium*.\n\nThis strategy would amplify, not mitigate, the pathogen breakthrough.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Backwash all filters at once and return them immediately to service without filter-to-waste to conserve water; hold coagulant dose constant; rely on on-line turbidity alarms set at $0.5$ NTU to warn of any breakthrough; increase free chlorine residual.**\n\nThis option demonstrates exceptionally poor operational practice.\n-   `Backwash all filters at once`: This takes the entire filtration barrier offline simultaneously. More importantly, it synchronizes the vulnerable \"ripening\" phase for all filters, creating a plant-wide period of maximum risk.\n-   `return them immediately to service without filter-to-waste`: This action guarantees that the high-turbidity, pathogen-laden water produced during filter ripening is sent into the final treated water.\n-   `hold coagulant dose constant`: This again fails to address the root cause of the upset.\n-   `rely on... alarms set at 0.5 NTU`: This is a reactive, not proactive, stance. For *Cryptosporidium* control, an individual filter effluent turbidity of $0.3$ NTU is already a serious alarm condition; waiting for $0.5$ NTU is inadequate.\n\nThis strategy would create a larger, more certain risk than doing nothing.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nSummary: Option A is the only response that aligns with best practices for water treatment plant operation during a process upset and demonstrates a correct understanding of the multi-barrier principle for controlling chlorine-resistant pathogens like *Cryptosporidium*.",
