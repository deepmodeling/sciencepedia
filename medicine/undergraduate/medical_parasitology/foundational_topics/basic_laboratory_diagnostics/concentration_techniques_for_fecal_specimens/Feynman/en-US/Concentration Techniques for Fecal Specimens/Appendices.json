Starting from the definition of centripetal acceleration and the relationship between angular speed and rotations per minute (rpm), derive the analytic expression for the required rpm, compute its numerical value, and then, based on first principles, explain how operating at this RCF affects pellet compaction and recovery of diagnostic stages in fecal concentration.\n\nUse $g = 9.80665\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$ and $r = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m}$ for calculations.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard laboratory procedure in medical parasitology and requires a calculation based on fundamental principles of circular motion, followed by a biophysical explanation. All necessary data are provided and are consistent. Therefore, a complete solution can be derived. The solution involves three parts: deriving the analytic expression for the centrifuge speed in rotations per minute (rpm), calculating its numerical value, and explaining the physical and biological implications of the specified Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF).\n\nFirst, we derive the analytic expression for the required speed in rpm, denoted by $N$. The Relative Centrifugal Force (RCF) is defined as the ratio of the centripetal acceleration, $a_c$, to the standard gravitational acceleration, $g$.\n$$\n\\text{RCF} = \\frac{a_c}{g}\n$$\nThe problem states that the desired RCF is $500$ times the force of gravity, which means the value of this ratio is $500$.\n$$\n\\frac{a_c}{g} = 500\n$$\nThe centripetal acceleration of an object in a circular path is given by $a_c = \\omega^2 r$, where $\\omega$ is the angular speed in radians per second and $r$ is the radius of the circular path.\n$$\na_c = \\omega^2 r\n$$\nSubstituting this into the RCF expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\omega^2 r}{g} = 500\n$$\nThe angular speed $\\omega$ must be related to the rotational speed $N$ in rpm. One revolution corresponds to $2\\pi$ radians, and one minute is equal to $60$ seconds. Therefore, the conversion is:\n$$\n\\omega \\, (\\text{rad/s}) = N \\, (\\text{rpm}) \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\, \\text{rad}}{1 \\, \\text{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\, \\text{min}}{60 \\, \\text{s}} = \\frac{2\\pi N}{60} = \\frac{\\pi N}{30}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\omega$ into the RCF equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\pi N}{30}\\right)^2 r}{g} = 500\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2 N^2 r}{900 g} = 500\n$$\nWe can now solve for $N$ to obtain the analytic expression for the required rpm:\n$$\nN^2 = \\frac{500 \\times 900 g}{\\pi^2 r}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\sqrt{\\frac{450000 g}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{450000}}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{r}} = \\frac{30 \\sqrt{50}}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{r}}\n$$\nA more general form using a variable for the RCF value (let's call it $RCF_{val}$) is:\n$$\nN = \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF_{val} \\times 900 g}{\\pi^2 r}} = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{RCF_{val} \\times g}{r}}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical value for $N$ using the provided constants: $r = 0.12 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and $g = 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$. The specified RCF value is $500$.\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{500 \\times 9.80665 \\, \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}}{0.12 \\, \\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{4903.325}{0.12} \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nN = \\frac{30}{\\pi} \\sqrt{40861.04167 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-2}}}\n$$\n$$\nN \\approx \\frac{30}{\\pi} (202.14114 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nN \\approx 9.549296 \\times 202.14114 \\, \\mathrm{min^{-1}} \\approx 1930.34 \\, \\mathrm{min^{-1}}\n$$\nThe speed is in rotations per minute, so the units are correct. Rounding the result to three significant figures gives:\n$$\nN \\approx 1930 \\, \\mathrm{rpm}\n$$\n\nThird, we explain from first principles how this RCF affects pellet compaction and recovery. The fundamental principle governing the sedimentation of particles in a fluid is Stokes' Law. For a particle in a centrifugal field, the sedimentation velocity, $v_s$, is given by:\n$$\nv_s = \\frac{d^2 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f) a_c}{18 \\eta}\n$$\nwhere $d$ is the particle diameter, $\\rho_p$ is the particle density, $\\rho_f$ is the fluid density, $\\eta$ is the fluid's dynamic viscosity, and $a_c$ is the centripetal acceleration ($a_c = RCF \\times g$).\n\nThis equation reveals that the sedimentation velocity is directly proportional to the applied acceleration ($a_c$). The choice of RCF is therefore a critical parameter that must be optimized to balance two competing requirements: recovery efficiency and sample integrity.\n\n1.  **Pellet Compaction and Sample Integrity**: A higher RCF results in a greater sedimentation velocity and a larger force compacting particles into the pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\n    *   **If RCF is too high (e.g.,  $1000 \\times g$):** This leads to overcompaction. The pellet becomes very hard and dense. Resuspending this pellet for microscopic analysis becomes difficult, which may result in diagnostic stages (eggs, cysts) being trapped and lost within the packed fecal debris. Furthermore, excessive force can damage or lyse fragile protozoan cysts (e.g., *Giardia lamblia*, *Dientamoeba fragilis*), distorting their morphology and rendering them unidentifiable. This reduces diagnostic sensitivity.\n    *   **If RCF is too low (e.g.,  $300 \\times g$):** Sedimentation is inefficient. The force may be insufficient to pellet all diagnostic stages within the given centrifugation time, especially for smaller or less dense cysts. Parasites may remain in the supernatant, which is discarded, leading to a low recovery rate and a high probability of a false-negative result. The resulting pellet is often loose and easily disturbed.\n\n2.  **Recovery of Diagnostic Stages**: The primary goal is to separate the denser parasites from the less dense components of the fecal suspension. Helminth eggs and protozoan cysts generally have a higher specific gravity (e.g., $\\approx 1.06-1.20$) than the aqueous formalin solution (specific gravity $\\approx 1.0$). The ethyl acetate layer removes fats and lipids (which are less dense and float), further cleaning the sample.\n    *   The RCF of $500 \\times g$ is an empirically established optimum. It provides sufficient force to efficiently sediment the target parasites in a reasonable time (typically $1-10$ minutes), maximizing the number of parasites recovered in the pellet. At the same time, it is gentle enough to prevent the overcompaction and organism damage associated with higher forces. This balance maximizes the probability of detecting parasites if they are present (high sensitivity) while preserving their morphology for accurate identification (high specificity).\n\nIn summary, the specified RCF of $500 \\times g$ is not an arbitrary value but a carefully chosen compromise, grounded in the physics of sedimentation, to maximize the recovery of intact, identifiable parasites from a complex biological sample.",
