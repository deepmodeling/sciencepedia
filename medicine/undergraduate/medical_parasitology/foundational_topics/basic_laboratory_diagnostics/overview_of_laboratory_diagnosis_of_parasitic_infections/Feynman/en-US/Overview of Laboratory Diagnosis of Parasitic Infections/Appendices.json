Many protozoan cysts and helminth eggs have overlapping morphologies but distinct size ranges, making micrometry a critical skill for differential diagnosis. This practice exercise  simulates the process of using a calibrated ocular micrometer to measure a protozoan cyst and applying this measurement to determine its compatibility with known species, reinforcing both calculation and diagnostic reasoning.",

            "problem": "An ocular micrometer is a measuring scale built into the eyepiece of a light microscope. When calibrated with a stage micrometer, the conversion from ocular divisions to actual length depends on the objective lens in use. In quantitative parasitology, micrometry is used to distinguish protozoan cysts whose diagnostic size ranges are well established. Assume the following foundational facts: (i) the measured linear dimension of an object on the microscope using an ocular micrometer equals the product of the number of observed ocular divisions and the calibration length per division; and (ii) cyst size ranges are biologically characteristic and are used for preliminary identification.\n\nA stool wet mount is examined under a $40\\times$ objective. The ocular micrometer has been calibrated under this objective to $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ per division. A spherical protozoan cyst spans $4.5$ ocular divisions across its maximal diameter. Accepted size ranges for two candidate protozoa are: Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, $10$–$15\\,\\mu\\text{m}$; Endolimax nana, $5$–$10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nUsing only the foundational facts stated, compute the cyst’s measured diameter and determine compatibility with the listed taxa based on size alone. Define an indicator variable $I$ as follows: $I=1$ if the measured diameter is compatible with Entamoeba histolytica/dispar, $I=2$ if compatible with Endolimax nana, and $I=0$ if incompatible with both. Express the measured diameter in micrometers and, if rounding is needed, round to four significant figures. Present your final answer as a row matrix with two entries, where the first entry is the measured diameter (numeric, in micrometers) and the second entry is $I$ (numeric). Do not include units inside the final boxed answer; use micrometers in your working.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a protozoan cyst's diameter based on microscopic measurement and subsequent comparison with known diagnostic size ranges to determine compatibility. The solution will proceed by first validating the problem statement and then, if valid, executing the required calculations and logical steps.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Foundational Fact (i): The measured linear dimension of an object on the microscope using an ocular micrometer equals the product of the number of observed ocular divisions and the calibration length per division.\n- Foundational Fact (ii): Cyst size ranges are biologically characteristic and are used for preliminary identification.\n- Objective lens magnification: $40\\times$.\n- Ocular micrometer calibration factor under the $40\\times$ objective: $2.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ per division.\n- Observed measurement of cyst diameter: $4.5$ ocular divisions.\n- Size range for *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar*: $10$–$15\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Size range for *Endolimax nana*: $5$–$10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Definition of indicator variable $I$: $I=1$ if compatible with *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar*, $I=2$ if compatible with *Endolimax nana*, and $I=0$ if incompatible with both.\n- Output requirements: The measured diameter in micrometers (rounded to four significant figures if needed) and the value of $I$, presented as a row matrix.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The principles of ocular micrometry and the use of size for identification of protozoan cysts are standard practices in diagnostic medical parasitology. The given size ranges for *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar* and *Endolimax nana* are consistent with established biological data. The calibration factor is plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear definitions to compute a unique answer. The language is objective and precise. There are no internal contradictions or missing information required to solve the problem as stated. The instructions for the final output format are explicit. A potential ambiguity could arise if a measurement fell on the exact boundary of two ranges (e.g., $10\\,\\mu\\text{m}$), but the given data do not present this issue.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $D$ represent the measured diameter of the spherical protozoan cyst in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$).\nLet $N$ be the number of ocular divisions spanned by the cyst's diameter.\nLet $C$ be the calibration factor for the ocular micrometer at the given objective magnification, in units of $\\mu\\text{m}$ per division.\n\nAccording to the foundational fact (i) provided in the problem statement, the relationship between these quantities is:\n$$D = N \\times C$$\n\nThe givens from the problem are:\n- $N = 4.5$ divisions\n- $C = 2.5 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{division}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$D = 4.5 \\times 2.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$$\n$$D = 11.25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures if rounding is needed. The calculated value of $11.25$ already has four significant figures, so no rounding is necessary. Thus, the measured diameter to be used for comparison is $D = 11.25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the compatibility of this measured diameter with the provided diagnostic size ranges.\nLet $R_E$ be the size range for *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar*, and $R_N$ be the size range for *Endolimax nana*.\n- $R_E = [10, 15] \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n- $R_N = [5, 10] \\, \\mu\\text{m}$\n\nWe check if $D$ falls within either of these intervals.\n1.  **Compatibility with *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar***:\n    Is $D \\in R_E$? This is equivalent to asking if $10 \\le 11.25 \\le 15$. This condition is true.\n\n2.  **Compatibility with *Endolimax nana***:\n    Is $D \\in R_N$? This is equivalent to asking if $5 \\le 11.25 \\le 10$. This condition is false, as $11.25 > 10$.\n\nThe measured diameter is compatible with *Entamoeba histolytica/dispar* but not with *Endolimax nana*.\n\nFinally, we determine the value of the indicator variable $I$ based on its definition:\n- $I=1$ if compatible with *E. histolytica/dispar*\n- $I=2$ if compatible with *E. nana*\n- $I=0$ if incompatible with both\n\nSince the cyst's diameter is compatible only with *E. histolytica/dispar*, the value of the indicator variable is:\n$$I = 1$$\n\nThe final answer consists of the measured diameter ($11.25 \\, \\mu\\text{m}$) and the indicator variable ($I=1$), presented as a row matrix.",

Round each computed EPG to four significant figures and express the final results in eggs per gram (EPG).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative laboratory diagnostics in medical parasitology, specifically the Kato-Katz method. The terms are well-defined, the data are realistic and self-consistent, and the problem is well-posed, asking for a derivation and application of a formula for concentration, which admits a unique solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for the concentration of parasitic eggs in a stool sample, measured in eggs per gram (EPG), and then apply this expression to specific data sets.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental relationship. The concentration, which in this context is the EPG, is defined as the number of entities (eggs) per unit mass of the medium (stool).\n$$\n\\text{EPG} = \\frac{\\text{Number of eggs}}{\\text{Mass of stool in grams}}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following variables:\n- $n$: the number of eggs counted on a single slide.\n- $m$: the mass of the stool sample on the slide, given in milligrams (mg).\n\nThe mass $m$ is given in milligrams, but the definition of EPG requires the mass to be in grams (g). We must therefore convert the mass from milligrams to grams. The problem provides the conversion factor:\n$$\n1 \\text{ g} = 1000 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nFrom this, we can write the conversion for a mass $M_{\\text{g}}$ in grams to a mass $M_{\\text{mg}}$ in milligrams as $M_{\\text{g}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{mg}}}{1000}$. Let the mass of the stool sample be $M$. In our case, $M_{\\text{mg}} = m$. Thus, the mass in grams is:\n$$\nM_{\\text{g}} = \\frac{m}{1000}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the count $n$ and the mass in grams into the EPG definition gives the general expression for a single slide:\n$$\n\\text{EPG} = \\frac{n}{M_{\\text{g}}} = \\frac{n}{\\frac{m}{1000}}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the general formula for EPG based on a count $n$ from a sample of mass $m$ in milligrams:\n$$\n\\text{EPG} = \\frac{1000 \\times n}{m}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the multiplication factor used in the Kato-Katz technique, where the factor is $\\frac{1000}{m}$.\n\nFor the first part of the problem, we apply this formula to a single slide where the egg count is $n = 12$ and the template mass is $m = 41.7 \\text{ mg}$.\n$$\n\\text{EPG} = \\frac{1000 \\times 12}{41.7} = \\frac{12000}{41.7} \\approx 287.76978...\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\text{EPG} \\approx 287.8\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we extend the calculation to two slides prepared with the same template mass, $m = 41.7 \\text{ mg}$. The egg counts are $n_{1} = 12$ and $n_{2} = 20$. The problem asks for a derivation based on either the average egg count or the total eggs over the total mass. We shall demonstrate their equivalence.\n\nMethod 1: Total eggs over total mass.\nThe total number of eggs counted is the sum of the counts from each slide:\n$$\nn_{\\text{total}} = n_{1} + n_{2} = 12 + 20 = 32\n$$\nThe total mass examined is the sum of the masses from each slide:\n$$\nm_{\\text{total}} = m + m = 2m = 2 \\times 41.7 \\text{ mg} = 83.4 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nUsing the general EPG formula with these total values:\n$$\n\\text{EPG}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1000 \\times n_{\\text{total}}}{m_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1000 \\times (n_{1} + n_{2})}{2m}\n$$\n\nMethod 2: Average egg count per slide.\nThe average number of eggs per slide is:\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{n_{1} + n_{2}}{2}\n$$\nThis average count $\\bar{n}$ is considered representative of a single slide of mass $m$.

This is equivalent to averaging the individual EPG values calculated for each slide: $\\text{EPG}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{EPG}_1 + \\text{EPG}_2)$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided data: $n_{1} = 12$, $n_{2} = 20$, and $m = 41.7 \\text{ mg}$.\n$$\n\\text{EPG}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1000 \\times (12 + 20)}{2 \\times 41.7} = \\frac{1000 \\times 32}{83.4} = \\frac{32000}{83.4} \\approx 383.69304...\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\text{EPG}_{\\text{avg}} \\approx 383.7\n$$\n\nThe two computed values are $287.8$ EPG for the single slide and $383.7$ EPG for the two-slide average.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nLet us establish the framework using conditional probability. Let $D$ be the event that an individual has the disease (malaria) and $D^c$ be the event that the individual does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result. The prevalence of the disease is the prior probability of having the disease, $P(D)$.\n\nFirst, we define the primary test characteristics based on these events.\nSensitivity ($Se$) is the probability that the test is positive, given that the individual has the disease. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease.\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D)$$\n\nSpecificity ($Sp$) is the probability that the test is negative, given that the individual does not have the disease. It measures the test's ability to correctly identify those without the disease.\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c)$$\n\nFrom these, two other probabilities can be derived:\nThe false positive rate is the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp$.\nThe false negative rate is the probability of a negative test in a diseased individual: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se$.\n\nNext, we define the predictive values, which are post-test probabilities.\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that an individual has the disease, given that the test result is positive.\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+)$$\n\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that an individual does not have the disease, given that the test result is negative.\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-)$$\n\nThe Likelihood Ratios (LR) quantify the diagnostic power of a test for a given result.\nThe Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^+$) is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual.\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)} = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp}$$\n\nThe Negative Likelihood Ratio ($LR^-$) is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in a diseased individual to the probability of a negative test in a non-diseased individual.\n$$LR^- = \\frac{P(T^- | D)}{P(T^- | D^c)} = \\frac{1 - Se}{Sp}$$\n\nNow, we derive the relationship between pre-test odds and post-test odds. Odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of an event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\nThe pre-test odds of disease are given by:\n$$Odds_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)}$$\n\nThe post-test odds of disease, given a positive test result ($T^+$), are:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{P(D | T^+)}{P(D^c | T^+)}$$\n\nTo connect these, we use Bayes' theorem for conditional probability, which states $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$. Applying this to the numerator and denominator of the post-test odds expression:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(D^c | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for post-test odds:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}}{\\frac{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this expression to separate the likelihood ratio and the pre-test odds:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\left( \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} \\right)$$\n\nRecognizing the terms, we arrive at the desired relationship:\n$$Odds_{post} = LR^+ \\times Odds_{pre}$$\nThis equation shows that the post-test odds of disease are obtained by multiplying the pre-test odds by the positive likelihood ratio. A similar derivation for a negative test result would show $Odds_{post} = LR^- \\times Odds_{pre}$.\n\nNow, we apply this derived relationship to the specific scenario provided.\nThe givens are:\nSensitivity, $Se = 0.95$\nSpecificity, $Sp = 0.98$\nPrevalence (pre-test probability), $P(D) = 0.05$\n\nStep 1: Calculate the pre-test odds of malaria.\n$$Odds_{pre} = \\frac{P(D)}{1 - P(D)} = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$).\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{Se}{1 - Sp} = \\frac{0.95}{1 - 0.98} = \\frac{0.95}{0.02}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the post-test odds of malaria given a positive RDT.\n$$Odds_{post} = LR^+ \\times Odds_{pre} = \\left( \\frac{0.95}{0.02} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{0.05}{0.95} \\right)$$\nThe $0.95$ terms cancel out:\n$$Odds_{post} = \\frac{0.05}{0.02} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5$$\n\nStep 4: Convert the post-test odds back to a probability. The problem asks for the post-test probability of malaria, which is $P(D | T^+)$, the PPV. The relationship between probability $p$ and odds is $p = \\frac{Odds}{1 + Odds}$.\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{Odds_{post}}{1 + Odds_{post}} = \\frac{2.5}{1 + 2.5} = \\frac{2.5}{3.5}$$\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{25}{35} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\n\nStep 5: Compute the final numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{5}{7} \\approx 0.7142857...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7143$.
