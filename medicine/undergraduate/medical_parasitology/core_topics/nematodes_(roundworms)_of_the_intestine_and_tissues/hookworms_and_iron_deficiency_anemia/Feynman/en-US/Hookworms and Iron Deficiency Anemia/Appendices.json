Stool examination reveals a mixed hookworm infection with $N_{A}=40$ adult worms of Ancylostoma duodenale and $N_{N}=120$ adult worms of Necator americanus. Empirically determined per-worm daily blood extraction rates are $b_{A}=0.20$ milliliters per day for Ancylostoma duodenale and $b_{N}=0.04$ milliliters per day for Necator americanus.

Consider the body’s iron stores as a compartment with amount $S(t)$, where inputs arise from dietary iron and outputs arise from physiologic routes and helminth-induced intestinal blood loss. Using the following definitions:\n- Dietary iron intake is $I$ in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n- The fractional absorption of dietary iron is $a$ (unitless, expressed as a decimal).\n- Physiologic iron losses from desquamation, bile, urine, and minimal gastrointestinal bleeding are $L$ in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n- Hookworm-induced intestinal blood loss is $B$ in $\\mathrm{mL/day}$.\n- The iron content of whole blood is $c$ in $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n\nBased on conservation of mass, derive the steady-state iron balance equation relating $\\frac{dS}{dt}$ to the above quantities, and from this, define the net iron deficit per day as the shortfall when total losses exceed absorbed dietary iron.

The pathophysiology of iron deficiency anemia due to hookworm-induced blood loss is a cornerstone of medical parasitology. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear objectives for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Calculation\nThe problem will be solved in two parts as requested: first, deriving the iron balance equation, and second, calculating the net iron deficit for the specific patient data provided.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Iron Balance Equation\nThe principle of conservation of mass states that the rate of change of the amount of a substance in a compartment is equal to the rate of input minus the rate of output. The compartment in this model is the body's total iron stores, $S(t)$.\n\nThe rate of iron input into the body is determined by the dietary intake and the fraction that is absorbed.\n- Rate of Input = (Fractional absorption) $\\times$ (Dietary intake)\n- Rate of Input = $aI$\n\nThe rate of iron output (loss) from the body occurs through two distinct routes: normal physiologic processes and pathological blood loss from the hookworm infection.\n- Physiologic Loss Rate = $L$\n- Hookworm-induced Loss Rate: This is the product of the volume of blood lost per day and the concentration of iron in that blood.\n- Hookworm-induced Loss Rate = $B \\times c$\n- Total Rate of Output = (Physiologic Loss Rate) + (Hookworm-induced Loss Rate)\n- Total Rate of Output = $L + Bc$\n\nThe iron balance equation describes the net rate of change of the body's iron stores, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$.\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Input}) - (\\text{Total Rate of Output}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the general iron balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = aI - (L + Bc) $$\nA net iron deficit occurs when the total rate of output exceeds the rate of input, leading to a negative value for $\\frac{dS}{dt}$. The problem defines the net iron deficit as the positive value of this shortfall.\n$$ \\text{Net Iron Deficit} = (\\text{Total Rate of Output}) - (\\text{Rate of Input}) = (L + Bc) - aI $$\nThis is equivalent to $-\\frac{dS}{dt}$ when a deficit exists.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Daily Net Iron Deficit\nWe are given the following values for a specific patient:\n- $I = 14$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$\n- $a = 0.10$\n- $L = 1.5$ $\\mathrm{mg/day}$\n- $B = 3.0$ $\\mathrm{mL/day}$\n- $c = 0.50$ $\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the rate of iron input (absorption):\n$$ \\text{Rate of Input} = aI = (0.10) \\times (14 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}) = 1.4 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the total rate of iron output (loss):\n$$ \\text{Total Rate of Output} = L + Bc = 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} + (3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL/day}) \\times (0.50 \\, \\mathrm{mg/mL}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Rate of Output} = 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} + 1.5 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} $$\n\nThe total output ($3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$) is greater than the input ($1.4 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day}$), so there is a net deficit. We calculate this deficit using the definition derived in Part 1:\n$$ \\text{Net Iron Deficit} = (L + Bc) - aI = 3.0 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} - 1.4 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} = 1.6 \\, \\mathrm{mg/day} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1.6$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $1.600$.",

Each *Ancylostoma duodenale* worm causes an average blood loss of $0.2$ $\\text{mL/day}$, each *Necator americanus* worm causes $0.03$ $\\text{mL/day}$, and whole blood contains approximately $0.5$ $\\text{mg}$ iron per $\\text{mL}$ due to the iron content of red blood cells (RBCs).

The average blood loss per worm is given by the function $b(f)$, where $f$ is the proportion of *A. duodenale*. The iron content of blood is $c$. Therefore, the iron loss due to worms is the product of the number of worms, the average blood loss per worm, and the iron concentration in blood.\n$$L_{\\text{worms}} = W \\cdot b(f) \\cdot c$$\nThus, the total loss is:\n$$L_{\\text{total}} = L_0 + W \\cdot b(f) \\cdot c$$\nFor a net iron balance of zero, we set intake equal to loss:\n$$I_0 + A_{\\text{supp}}(S) = L_0 + W \\cdot b(f) \\cdot c$$\nThe problem defines the threshold worm burden, $W^*$, as the specific burden $W$ at which the net iron balance is zero even when the patient receives the maximum tolerated supplement dose, $S = S_{\\max}$.
