            "problem": "A hospitalized patient with chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection is at imminent risk of hyperinfection syndrome due to planned corticosteroid therapy. To minimize missed detection before immunosuppression, the care team orders serial stool Ova and Parasite (O&P) examinations on three consecutive days. Assume the following fundamental base: sensitivity is defined as the single-specimen probability of detection conditioned on true infection, and independence means successive test outcomes do not influence each other. Let the per-test stool sensitivity be $s=0.3$ and the number of tests be $n=3$. Starting from the definition of sensitivity and the complement rule for probabilities, derive the cumulative probability that at least one of the $n$ tests will detect infection under the assumption of independence. Then compute the value for the given $s$ and $n$. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. Finally, discuss qualitatively, using first principles of probability and the biological features of Strongyloides stercoralis autoinfection and hyperinfection (for example, temporally correlated larval output), how dependence between tests would alter the independence-based estimate you derived.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The scenario described is a standard clinical problem in infectious disease and medical parasitology. The parameters provided ($s=0.3$ for single-test sensitivity of stool O&P for *Strongyloides*, $n=3$ serial tests) are realistic. The task involves a standard probability derivation, a numerical calculation, and a qualitative analysis linking the mathematical model to the underlying biology of the parasite. All components are clearly defined and formalizable. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe solution is approached in three parts as requested: derivation of the cumulative probability, computation of the numerical value, and a qualitative discussion of the independence assumption.\n\n**1. Derivation of Cumulative Probability**\n\nLet $s$ be the sensitivity of a single test, defined as the probability of detecting the infection given that the patient is truly infected. Let $n$ be the number of independent tests performed.\nLet $D_i$ be the event that the $i$-th test is positive (detects the infection), for $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$.\nAccording to the definition provided, the probability of any single test being positive is $P(D_i) = s$.\n\nWe are asked to find the cumulative probability that at least one of the $n$ tests will be positive. This corresponds to the probability of the union of the events $D_1, D_2, \\dots, D_n$.\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = P(D_1 \\cup D_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup D_n)$$\n\nCalculating this union directly is cumbersome. It is more efficient to use the complement rule. The complement of the event \"at least one test is positive\" is the event \"all tests are negative\".\nLet $D_i^c$ denote the complement of $D_i$, which is the event that test $i$ is negative.\nThe probability of a single test being negative is:\n$$P(D_i^c) = 1 - P(D_i) = 1 - s$$\nThis quantity, $1-s$, represents the false negative rate for a single test.\n\nThe event \"all tests are negative\" is the intersection of the individual negative test events: $D_1^c \\cap D_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap D_n^c$.\nThe problem specifies that the tests are to be considered independent. The assumption of independence means that the outcome of one test does not influence the outcome of any other. Mathematically, this allows us to write the probability of the intersection as the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$P(\\text{all negative}) = P(D_1^c \\cap D_2^c \\cap \\dots \\cap D_n^c) = P(D_1^c) \\times P(D_2^c) \\times \\dots \\times P(D_n^c)$$\nSince $P(D_i^c) = 1 - s$ for all $i$, this product becomes:\n$$P(\\text{all negative}) = (1 - s)^n$$\n\nThe cumulative probability of at least one positive test, $P_{\\text{cum}}$, is the complement of all tests being negative.\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - P(\\text{all negative})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(\\text{all negative})$, we arrive at the general formula for the cumulative probability of detection:\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - (1 - s)^n$$\n\n**2. Numerical Computation**\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nPer-test sensitivity, $s = 0.3$.\nNumber of tests, $n = 3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - (1 - 0.3)^3$$\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - (0.7)^3$$\nFirst, we compute the power:\n$$(0.7)^3 = 0.7 \\times 0.7 \\times 0.7 = 0.49 \\times 0.7 = 0.343$$\nNow, we complete the calculation for $P_{\\text{cum}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - 0.343 = 0.657$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $0.657$, which has three significant figures. To express this with four, we append a zero.\n$$P_{\\text{cum}} \\approx 0.6570$$\n\n**3. Qualitative Discussion on the Independence Assumption**\n\nThe assumption of independence, while mathematically convenient, is unlikely to hold true for serial stool examinations for *Strongyloides stercoralis*. The biological features of the parasite's life cycle, particularly its autoinfective capability and the resulting pattern of larval excretion, introduce temporal dependence.\n\nThe output of *S. stercoralis* larvae in stool is notoriously intermittent and variable in quantity. A patient may experience periods of higher larval shedding followed by periods of very low or no shedding. This fluctuation is not purely random from day to day. A state of low larval output on one day is likely to be correlated with a state of low larval output on the subsequent day. This is a form of positive temporal correlation.\n\nLet's analyze the impact of this positive correlation on the calculated probability. The derivation for the independent case relies on the equality $P(D_2^c | D_1^c) = P(D_2^c) = 1-s$. This states that the probability of the second test being negative is unaffected by the first test being negative.\n\nWith positive correlation, if the first test is negative ($D_1^c$), it provides evidence that the patient might be in a low-shedding state. Therefore, the conditional probability of the second test also being negative is higher than the average, unconditional probability.\n$$P(D_2^c | D_1^c) > 1-s$$\nSimilarly, if the first two tests are negative, it reinforces the evidence of a low-shedding state, so $P(D_3^c | D_1^c \\cap D_2^c) > 1-s$.\n\nThe true probability of all three tests being negative is given by the chain rule of probability:\n$$P(\\text{all negative})_{\\text{dep}} = P(D_1^c) \\times P(D_2^c | D_1^c) \\times P(D_3^c | D_1^c \\cap D_2^c)$$\nDue to positive correlation, each conditional probability term is greater than its independent counterpart ($1-s$), except for the first term. This means the overall product will be larger:\n$$P(\\text{all negative})_{\\text{dep}} > P(D_1^c) \\times P(D_2^c) \\times P(D_3^c) = (1 - s)^n$$\nTherefore, the true probability of all tests being negative is higher than what the independence model predicts.\n\nThe cumulative probability of at least one detection is $P_{\\text{cum}} = 1 - P(\\text{all negative})$. Since positive dependence increases the probability of an all-negative outcome, it must decrease the probability of its complement (at least one positive).\n$$P_{\\text{cum, dep}} = 1 - P(\\text{all negative})_{\\text{dep}}  1 - (1 - s)^n$$\nIn conclusion, the independence-based estimate of $0.6570$ is an **overestimate** of the true cumulative probability of detection. The biological reality of correlated larval shedding means that negative results tend to cluster together, making a string of three consecutive negative tests more probable than assumed, and consequently making the event of \"at least one positive test\" less probable.",

This case study challenges you to apply the formal definitions of hyperinfection syndrome and disseminated strongyloidiasis, two conditions that are often confused.

He started high-dose prednisone $2$ weeks ago for a flare of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). On admission he is in shock requiring vasopressors; blood cultures grow Gram-negative rods. A stool agar plate culture shows migrating tracks with motile larvae consistent with Strongyloides species. Concentrated sputum microscopy reveals filariform larvae. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is unremarkable, and cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Strongyloides deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is negative. No larvae are detected in urine or other sterile body fluids. \n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of the Strongyloides stercoralis life cycle and disease states, decide which classification best fits this presentation and why. The base facts to employ are: autoinfection is intrinsic to the life cycle; hyperinfection syndrome represents an increase in intrahost larval burden with amplification of the normal gastrointestinal–pulmonary migration; disseminated strongyloidiasis is defined by the presence of larvae in organs or body fluids not typically involved in the autoinfection route (for example, central nervous system (CNS), liver, kidney, or in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or urine). Mucosal translocation of enteric bacteria can occur along migrating larvae and may cause Gram-negative bacteremia and shock.\n\nWhich option best classifies this case and justifies the classification?\n\nA. Hyperinfection syndrome without dissemination, because increased larval migration along the usual gastrointestinal–pulmonary route is evidenced by larvae in stool and sputum, and Gram-negative bacteremia can result from enteric translocation during hyperinfection; the absence of larvae in sites outside this route (for example, negative CSF) argues against dissemination.\n\nB. Disseminated strongyloidiasis without hyperinfection, because the presence of septic shock with Gram-negative bacteremia indicates hematogenous spread of larvae beyond the usual route, even if larvae are confined to stool and sputum.\n\nC. Both hyperinfection and dissemination, because sputum larvae prove hyperinfection and the concomitant Gram-negative bacteremia and shock establish dissemination, regardless of negative CSF findings.\n\nD. Neither hyperinfection nor dissemination, because larvae in sputum may be seen in chronic pulmonary colonization and the bacteremia is likely unrelated to Strongyloides migration.",
            "solution": "First principles and core definitions relevant to Strongyloides stercoralis disease states:\n\n1. Life cycle and autoinfection: Strongyloides stercoralis can complete an autoinfection cycle in the human host. Rhabditiform larvae in the intestine can develop into filariform larvae that penetrate the intestinal mucosa or perianal skin, enter the venous circulation, migrate to the lungs, ascend the tracheobronchial tree, and are swallowed back to the intestine. This gastrointestinal–pulmonary route is the normal autoinfection pathway, and it permits persistence for decades.\n\n2. Hyperinfection syndrome: Hyperinfection denotes an increase in the number of migrating larvae and an acceleration of the normal autoinfection cycle, typically precipitated by immunosuppression such as corticosteroids. Clinically, hyperinfection is characterized by increased larval burden in sites along the usual route (gastrointestinal tract and lungs), for example, abundant larvae in stool and sputum, and can be accompanied by severe gastrointestinal and pulmonary symptoms.\n\n3. Disseminated strongyloidiasis: Dissemination is defined by the presence of larvae in organs or body fluids not involved in the usual autoinfection pathway, such as the central nervous system (CNS), liver, kidney, or detection of larvae in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or urine. While disseminated disease often coexists with hyperinfection in profoundly immunocompromised patients, the diagnostic criterion is larval presence outside the gastrointestinal–pulmonary axis.\n\n4. Bacterial translocation and sepsis: Migrating larvae can carry enteric bacteria transmurally and hematogenously, causing Gram-negative bacteremia and septic shock. The occurrence of Gram-negative bacteremia is a complication that can accompany hyperinfection or dissemination; however, bacteremia alone does not demonstrate larval presence in non-autoinfection sites.\n\nApply these principles to the case:\n\n- The patient has risk factors for hyperinfection (recent initiation of high-dose corticosteroids).\n- Stool agar culture with characteristic tracks and larvae indicates heavy intestinal larval output.\n- Sputum microscopy with filariform larvae provides direct evidence of larval migration along the pulmonary component of the normal autoinfection route, consistent with hyperinfection.\n- Gram-negative bacteremia and shock can be explained by bacterial translocation along migrating larvae and are not, by themselves, proof of dissemination.\n- There is no evidence that larvae are present in non-autoinfection sites: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is negative, and no larvae are reported in urine, blood, or other sterile compartments. Therefore, the defining criterion for dissemination is not met.\n\nThus, the best classification is hyperinfection syndrome without proven dissemination.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Hyperinfection syndrome without dissemination, because increased larval migration along the usual gastrointestinal–pulmonary route is evidenced by larvae in stool and sputum, and Gram-negative bacteremia can result from enteric translocation during hyperinfection; the absence of larvae in sites outside this route (for example, negative CSF) argues against dissemination.\nEvaluation: This aligns with the definitions. The findings localize to the gastrointestinal–pulmonary pathway and there is no detection of larvae in non-autoinfection sites. Gram-negative bacteremia is an expected complication of hyperinfection via bacterial translocation and does not, on its own, establish dissemination. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Disseminated strongyloidiasis without hyperinfection, because the presence of septic shock with Gram-negative bacteremia indicates hematogenous spread of larvae beyond the usual route, even if larvae are confined to stool and sputum.\nEvaluation: This misinterprets bacteremia as proof of larval dissemination. Dissemination requires demonstration of larvae in non-autoinfection sites; bacteremia shows bacterial, not larval, spread. The presence of larvae in sputum, a usual-route site, supports hyperinfection rather than exclusive dissemination. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Both hyperinfection and dissemination, because sputum larvae prove hyperinfection and the concomitant Gram-negative bacteremia and shock establish dissemination, regardless of negative CSF findings.\nEvaluation: While sputum larvae support hyperinfection, bacteremia and shock do not fulfill the criterion for dissemination without evidence of larvae in extra–autoinfection sites (for example, CNS, urine, blood with larvae). Negative CSF testing and absence of larvae elsewhere argue against dissemination. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Neither hyperinfection nor dissemination, because larvae in sputum may be seen in chronic pulmonary colonization and the bacteremia is likely unrelated to Strongyloides migration.\nEvaluation: Chronic Strongyloides infection does not typically feature larvae in sputum; larval detection in sputum implies increased pulmonary migration consistent with hyperinfection. The temporal association with steroids and the known pathophysiology support a causal link to bacteremia via translocation. Verdict: Incorrect.",

            "problem": "A hematology-oncology service must decide on a ward policy for empiric administration of ivermectin to prevent Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection syndrome in patients who will start high-dose corticosteroids within $24$ to $48$ hours, while diagnostic turnaround for Strongyloides stercoralis testing is delayed. The clinical challenge is to minimize expected severe harm, defined as either death from hyperinfection or severe drug-related adverse events, under realistic constraints of diagnostic sensitivity and timing. Use the following fundamental base and well-tested facts to reason from first principles:\n\n- Autoinfection in Strongyloides stercoralis permits internal amplification of infective filariform larvae, enabling persistent infection. High-dose corticosteroids accelerate larval production and suppress host immunity, which increases the probability of hyperinfection and disseminated disease.\n- In immunosuppressed patients with untreated Strongyloides stercoralis infection, hyperinfection can occur rapidly after corticosteroid initiation and carries high mortality.\n- Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) serology for Strongyloides stercoralis has high sensitivity but a turnaround time of approximately $5$ days; stool culture on agar has a turnaround of approximately $7$ days; direct stool microscopy can be available within $1$ day but has low sensitivity (approximately $30\\%$).\n- Ivermectin is the first-line therapy; severe adverse events are rare, but risk increases markedly in patients with Loa loa exposure due to potential encephalopathy in the setting of high microfilarial loads. Loa loa exposure is credible in individuals with residence or prolonged travel in rainforested regions of Central and West Africa.\n\nFor decision analysis, adopt the following plausible, ward-level parameterization:\n- Pre-test probability of chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection in patients with epidemiologic exposure (residence or prolonged travel in endemic regions) without eosinophilia: $p_{e} = 0.15$; with unexplained eosinophilia: $p_{e,\\,eos} = 0.30$.\n- Pre-test probability in patients without epidemiologic exposure: $p_{l} = 0.005$; with unexplained eosinophilia: $p_{l,\\,eos} = 0.02$.\n- Probability of hyperinfection in an infected patient given imminent high-dose corticosteroids: $r_{h} = 0.10$.\n- Case fatality (mortality) for hyperinfection if untreated: $m = 0.60$.\n- Severe adverse event probability for ivermectin in general patients: $r_{sev} = 0.001$; in patients with credible Loa loa exposure: $r_{sev,\\,Loa} = 0.02$.\n- Ivermectin efficacy in preventing hyperinfection if administered before steroids: reduce hyperinfection risk by approximately $90\\%$ (residual proportion $0.10$).\n\nAssume the ward must choose a single policy to apply before test results are available.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is a clinical decision analysis scenario. I will first validate the problem statement according to the specified protocol.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n- **Clinical Scenario**: A hematology-oncology service needs a policy for empiric ivermectin administration to patients starting high-dose corticosteroids within $24$ to $48$ hours, due to delayed diagnostic test turnaround.\n- **Goal**: Minimize expected severe harm, defined as death from *Strongyloides stercoralis* hyperinfection or severe drug-related adverse events.\n- **Pathophysiological Facts**:\n    - *S. stercoralis* autoinfection enables persistent infection via internal amplification of filariform larvae.\n    - High-dose corticosteroids accelerate larval production and suppress immunity, increasing the risk of hyperinfection and disseminated disease.\n    - Untreated hyperinfection in immunosuppressed patients has high mortality.\n- **Diagnostic Parameters**:\n    - ELISA serology: High sensitivity, turnaround time ~$5$ days.\n    - Stool culture (agar): Turnaround time ~$7$ days.\n    - Direct stool microscopy: Turnaround time ~$1$ day, sensitivity ~$30\\%$.\n- **Therapeutic and Risk Parameters**:\n    - Ivermectin is first-line therapy.\n    - Severe adverse event risk increases with *Loa loa* co-exposure, which is credible for individuals from Central/West African rainforest regions.\n- **Quantitative Parameters**:\n    - Pre-test probability of *S. stercoralis* infection ($p$):\n        - With epidemiologic exposure, no eosinophilia: $p_{e} = 0.15$\n        - With epidemiologic exposure and unexplained eosinophilia: $p_{e,\\,eos} = 0.30$\n        - Without epidemiologic exposure, no eosinophilia: $p_{l} = 0.005$\n        - Without epidemiologic exposure and unexplained eosinophilia: $p_{l,\\,eos} = 0.02$\n    - Probability of hyperinfection in an infected, untreated patient on corticosteroids: $r_{h} = 0.10$.\n    - Case fatality rate for untreated hyperinfection: $m = 0.60$.\n    - Probability of severe adverse event (SAE) from ivermectin:\n        - General patient: $r_{sev} = 0.001$\n        - Patient with credible *Loa loa* exposure: $r_{sev,\\,Loa} = 0.02$\n    - Ivermectin efficacy in preventing hyperinfection: risk reduction of $90\\%$ (residual proportion of risk is $0.10$).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: Yes. The problem is based on established principles of medical parasitology, infectious diseases, and clinical pharmacology. The information regarding *S. stercoralis* life cycle, corticosteroid-induced hyperinfection, ivermectin's efficacy and its specific risks in *Loa loa* co-infection are all factually correct and represent standard medical knowledge.\n- **Well-Posed**: Yes. The problem is a classic decision analysis task. It provides a clear objective (minimize expected severe harm) and all necessary quantitative parameters (probabilities, efficacies, risks) to mathematically model the decision and derive an optimal policy.\n- **Objective**: Yes. The problem is stated in precise, technical, and unbiased language. The parameters, while stylized for a model, are presented as given facts for the analysis.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The time-critical nature of starting corticosteroids ($24-48$ hours) versus the long turnaround for sensitive tests ($ 5$ days) establishes the central dilemma justifying consideration of empiric therapy. The parameters are internally consistent.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is highly realistic. Managing the risk of *Strongyloides* hyperinfection is a significant concern in clinical settings where potent immunosuppressants like high-dose corticosteroids are used. The provided probabilities are plausible for a risk-stratified patient population.\n- **Structure**: The problem is well-structured, guiding the solver to derive a decision threshold and apply it to patient subgroups, which is the standard method for such analyses.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound, and solvable decision analysis problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Decision Threshold\n\nThe decision to administer empiric ivermectin hinges on a comparison of expected harms. Empiric therapy is justified if the expected severe harm from not treating is greater than the expected severe harm from treating. Let $p$ be the pre-test probability of a patient being infected with *S. stercoralis*.\n\n**1. Expected Harm of NOT Treating Empirically ($Harm_{NT}$)**\n\nIf we do not treat, harm occurs only if the patient is infected. The chain of events is: patient is infected (probability $p$) $\\rightarrow$ develops hyperinfection (probability $r_h$) $\\rightarrow$ dies from hyperinfection (probability $m$).\nThe total expected harm (mortality risk) is the product of these probabilities:\n$$Harm_{NT} = p \\times r_{h} \\times m$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Harm_{NT} = p \\times 0.10 \\times 0.60 = 0.06p$$\n\n**2. Expected Harm of Treating Empirically ($Harm_{T}$)**\n\nIf we treat, there are two sources of potential harm:\na) Harm from the drug itself: A severe adverse event (SAE) can occur with probability $r_{sev}$, regardless of the patient's infection status.\nb) Harm from treatment failure: If the patient is infected (probability $p$), the treatment might fail to prevent hyperinfection. Ivermectin reduces the hyperinfection risk by $90\\%$, so the residual risk is $10\\%$ of the original risk.\nThe probability of hyperinfection despite treatment is $r_h \\times (1 - 0.90) = 0.10 \\times 0.10 = 0.01$.\nThe expected harm from treatment failure is then: $p \\times (0.01) \\times m = p \\times 0.01 \\times 0.60 = 0.006p$.\n\nThe total expected harm from treating is the sum of these two components:\n$$Harm_{T} = r_{sev} + (p \\times (\\text{residual hyperinfection risk}) \\times m)$$\n$$Harm_{T} = r_{sev} + 0.006p$$\n\n**3. Decision Threshold Calculation**\n\nEmpiric therapy is favored when $Harm_{NT}  Harm_{T}$.\n$$0.06p  r_{sev} + 0.006p$$\nTo find the threshold probability $p_{threshold}$, we solve this inequality for $p$:\n$$0.06p - 0.006p  r_{sev}$$\n$$0.054p  r_{sev}$$\n$$p  \\frac{r_{sev}}{0.054}$$\nThis is the decision rule: treat if the patient's pre-test probability of infection $p$ is greater than the threshold $\\frac{r_{sev}}{0.054}$.\n\nWe must calculate this threshold for the two different risk scenarios for ivermectin.\n\n- **Case 1: General Patient (no *Loa loa* exposure)**\n    The risk of a severe adverse event is $r_{sev} = 0.001$.\n    $$p_{threshold}  \\frac{0.001}{0.054} \\approx 0.0185$$\n    For a general patient, empiric therapy is warranted if their probability of *S. stercoralis* infection is greater than approximately $1.85\\%$.\n\n- **Case 2: Patient with credible *Loa loa* exposure**\n    The risk of a severe adverse event is much higher: $r_{sev,\\,Loa} = 0.02$.\n    $$p_{threshold, \\, Loa}  \\frac{0.02}{0.054} \\approx 0.370$$\n    For a patient with *Loa loa* exposure, empiric therapy is only warranted if their probability of *S. stercoralis* infection is greater than approximately $37.0\\%$.\n\n### Application to Patient Subgroups\n\nNow, we compare the pre-test probabilities ($p$) of the defined patient subgroups to the derived thresholds. We assume no *Loa loa* exposure unless specified.\n\n- **Subgroup 1**: Epidemiologic exposure, no eosinophilia ($p_{e} = 0.15$)\n  $0.15  0.0185 \\implies$ Treatment is indicated.\n- **Subgroup 2**: Epidemiologic exposure and eosinophilia ($p_{e,\\,eos} = 0.30$)\n  $0.30  0.0185 \\implies$ Treatment is indicated.\n- **Subgroup 3**: No epidemiologic exposure, no eosinophilia ($p_{l} = 0.005$)\n  $0.005  0.0185 \\implies$ Treatment is NOT indicated.\n- **Subgroup 4**: No epidemiologic exposure, but with eosinophilia ($p_{l,\\,eos} = 0.02$)\n  $0.02  0.0185 \\implies$ Treatment is indicated.\n\nBased on this analysis, the optimal policy (for patients without *Loa loa* exposure) is to administer empiric ivermectin to any patient with either epidemiologic exposure (Subgroups 1 and 2) or unexplained eosinophilia (Subgroups 2 and 4).\n\nFor patients with *Loa loa* exposure, the treatment threshold is $p  0.37$. None of the defined subgroups meet this high threshold (the highest pre-test probability is $p_{e,\\,eos}=0.30$). Therefore, for any patient with credible *Loa loa* exposure, empiric ivermectin is contraindicated as the risk of the drug outweighs its potential benefit.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Administer empiric ivermectin to all patients who will start high-dose corticosteroids within $48$ hours, regardless of epidemiologic exposure or eosinophil count.**\nThis policy would treat Subgroup 3 patients ($p_l = 0.005$), for whom our analysis shows treatment is not indicated ($0.005  0.0185$). This constitutes overtreatment. Furthermore, it fails to make an exception for patients with *Loa loa* exposure, for whom empiric ivermectin carries an unacceptably high risk of severe adverse events.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Administer empiric ivermectin only to patients with peripheral eosinophilia, regardless of travel or residence history; for others, defer therapy and await ELISA or stool culture.**\nThis policy would correctly treat Subgroups 2 and 4 (with eosinophilia) but would fail to treat Subgroup 1 (exposure, no eosinophilia). For Subgroup 1, the pre-test probability is $p_e=0.15$, which is well above the treatment threshold of $0.0185$. This policy constitutes undertreatment, exposing this high-risk group to the possibility of hyperinfection. It also fails to account for the *Loa loa* contraindication.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Administer empiric ivermectin to any patient with epidemiologic exposure to Strongyloides stercoralis (residence or prolonged travel in endemic regions) or unexplained eosinophilia who must start high-dose corticosteroids within $48$ hours, but defer empiric ivermectin and obtain rapid microfilarial testing when there is credible Loa loa exposure in Central/West Africa.**\nThis policy has two parts.\n1. The indication for treatment is \"epidemiologic exposure OR unexplained eosinophilia.\" This correctly identifies Subgroups 1, 2, and 4 as needing treatment, as their pre-test probabilities ($0.15$, $0.30$, and $0.02$, respectively) all exceed the threshold of $0.0185$. It correctly excludes Subgroup 3 ($p_l=0.005$). This part of the policy is optimal based on our derivation.\n2. The policy creates a specific exception for patients with credible *Loa loa* exposure, recommending deferral of empiric therapy. Our analysis showed that for this group, the risk of ivermectin-induced SAEs is high, leading to a high treatment threshold ($p  0.37$) that is not met by any patient subgroup. Deferring and seeking more diagnostic information (e.g., rapid testing for *Loa loa* microfilariae) is the most prudent course of action to minimize harm.\nThis policy perfectly aligns with our quantitative decision analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Defer empiric therapy for all patients; await ELISA or stool culture before initiating ivermectin, even if high-dose corticosteroids must start within $48$ hours.**\nThis policy is equivalent to never treating empirically. It ignores the fact that for several subgroups, the expected harm of not treating far exceeds the expected harm of treating. For example, for a patient with exposure and eosinophilia ($p=0.30$), the expected harm of not treating is $0.06 \\times 0.30 = 0.018$, while the expected harm of treating (assuming no *Loa loa* risk) is $0.001 + 0.006 \\times 0.30 = 0.0028$. Not treating is clearly the more dangerous option. Given that steroid initiation is imminent and test results are delayed for days, this policy would directly lead to preventable cases of hyperinfection and death.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
