Since these flies are poikilothermic, their rate of development is critically dependent on ambient temperature. This exercise introduces the degree-day model, a powerful quantitative tool for predicting the time required for a larva to reach a specific developmental stage, such as pupation, based on accumulated thermal energy .",

            "problem": "In medical parasitology, many myiasis-causing blowflies exhibit temperature-dependent larval development that can be approximated as linear above a species-specific base temperature. Consider the degree-day (DD) framework, in which daily developmental accumulation for day index $t$ with mean air temperature $T_{t}$ and base temperature $T_{0}$ is given by the effective temperature surplus $T_{t}-T_{0}$ whenever $T_{t}>T_{0}$, and zero otherwise. The accumulated degree-days after $n$ days is $DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\max\\{0,\\,T_{t}-T_{0}\\}$. Empirically, a species reaches pupation once a threshold $DD^{*}$ of accumulated degree-days has been attained.\n\nStarting from these definitions, derive an expression for the expected time to pupation, denoted $t^{*}$ (in days), under the assumption that the daily mean temperature is constant at $T$ with $T>T_{0}$. Your derivation should begin from the accumulation rule and proceed to a closed-form expression for $t^{*}$ in terms of $DD^{*}$, $T$, and $T_{0}$, without invoking any result not derivable from the given definitions.\n\nThen, for a myiasis-causing fly whose larval stage requires $DD^{*}=180$ degree-days above a base temperature $T_{0}=10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and in an environment where the mean daily temperature is constant at $T=25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ during the larval period, compute the expected time to pupation. Express your final numerical answer in days as an exact value (no rounding needed).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the expected time to pupation, $t^{*}$, under the degree-day model, followed by a specific calculation. The validation of the problem statement is the mandatory first step.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The daily developmental accumulation for a day with index $t$ is given by $\\max\\{0,\\,T_{t}-T_{0}\\}$, where $T_{t}$ is the mean air temperature on day $t$ and $T_{0}$ is the base temperature.\n- The accumulated degree-days (DD) after $n$ days is defined as $DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\max\\{0,\\,T_{t}-T_{0}\\}$.\n- Pupation occurs when a threshold of accumulated degree-days, $DD^{*}$, is reached.\n- For the derivation, the daily mean temperature is assumed to be constant, $T_{t} = T$, for all $t$.\n- It is also assumed that $T > T_{0}$.\n- The goal of the first part is to derive a closed-form expression for the time to pupation, $t^{*}$, in terms of $DD^{*}$, $T$, and $T_{0}$.\n- For the numerical calculation, the following values are provided: $DD^{*} = 180$ degree-days, $T_{0} = 10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, and $T=25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The degree-day model is a fundamental and widely accepted tool in entomology, including its application in medical and forensic contexts like myiasis. The linear approximation of development rate above a base temperature is a standard and scientifically valid simplification used in such models. The problem is grounded in established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides a set of definitions and assumptions and asks for a derivation and subsequent calculation. The assumptions of constant temperature ($T$) and $T > T_{0}$ ensure that a unique and meaningful solution can be found.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and formal mathematical language. The terms are well-defined, and there is no subjective or ambiguous phrasing.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental definition of accumulated degree-days after $n$ days:\n$$DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\max\\{0,\\,T_{t}-T_{0}\\}$$\nThe problem states that for the derivation, we must assume the daily mean temperature is a constant value, $T$, for all days. Thus, we can substitute $T_{t} = T$ into the equation:\n$$DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}\\max\\{0,\\,T-T_{0}\\}$$\nWe are also given the condition that $T > T_{0}$. This implies that the difference $T-T_{0}$ is a positive value. Consequently, the maximum of $0$ and $T-T_{0}$ is simply $T-T_{0}$:\n$$\\max\\{0,\\,T-T_{0}\\} = T-T_{0}$$\nSubstituting this back into the summation, we get:\n$$DD(n)=\\sum_{t=1}^{n}(T-T_{0})$$\nThe term $(T-T_{0})$ is a constant with respect to the summation index $t$. The sum of a constant term over $n$ iterations is equal to $n$ times the constant term. Therefore, the expression for accumulated degree-days simplifies to:\n$$DD(n) = n(T-T_{0})$$\nPupation is defined to occur at the time $t^{*}$ when the accumulated degree-days, $DD(t^{*})$, reach the species-specific threshold, $DD^{*}$. We set $n=t^{*}$ and $DD(t^{*})=DD^{*}$ in our simplified equation:\n$$DD^{*} = t^{*}(T-T_{0})$$\nTo find the expression for the time to pupation, $t^{*}$, we rearrange this equation. Since we know $T > T_{0}$, the term $(T-T_{0})$ is non-zero, and we can legally divide by it:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{DD^{*}}{T-T_{0}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the expected time to pupation.\n\nNext, we must compute the numerical value of $t^{*}$ for the specific case provided. The given parameters are:\n- $DD^{*} = 180$ degree-days\n- $T = 25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{0} = 10^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{180}{25 - 10}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the denominator:\n$$25 - 10 = 15$$\nNow we perform the division:\n$$t^{*} = \\frac{180}{15}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can note that $180 = 10 \\times 18$ and $15 = 1.5 \\times 10$, or more simply, $180 = 12 \\times 15$.\n$$t^{*} = 12$$\nThe expected time to pupation is $12$ days.",
