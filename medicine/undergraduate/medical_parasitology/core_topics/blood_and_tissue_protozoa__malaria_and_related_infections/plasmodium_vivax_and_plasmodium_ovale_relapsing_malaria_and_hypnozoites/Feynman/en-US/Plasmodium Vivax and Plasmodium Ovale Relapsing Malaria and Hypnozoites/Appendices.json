            "problem": "A patient presents with a febrile illness consistent with relapsing malaria following prior treatment. In the region from which the patient recently returned, both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale are endemic and are known to form dormant hypnozoites in the liver that can later reactivate and cause relapse. A thin blood smear is examined to differentiate species based on two microscopy features associated with Plasmodium ovale: (i) an oval red blood cell (RBC) with fimbriated edges, and (ii) a mature schizont with at most $12$ merozoites. Let feature $A$ denote the presence of an oval RBC with fimbriation, and feature $B$ denote the observation that a mature schizont has at most $12$ merozoites. Assume that, conditional on the true species, the events $A$ and $B$ are independent.\n\nIn this clinic’s performance study, the following conditional probabilities were measured:\n- For Plasmodium ovale: $\\Pr(A \\mid \\text{ovale}) = 0.82$ and $\\Pr(B \\mid \\text{ovale}) = 0.88$.\n- For Plasmodium vivax: $\\Pr(A \\mid \\text{vivax}) = 0.07$ and $\\Pr(B \\mid \\text{vivax}) = 0.20$.\n\nThe pre-test probabilities for a relapsing case in this setting are $\\Pr(\\text{ovale}) = 0.35$ and $\\Pr(\\text{vivax}) = 0.65$. On the patient’s smear, both $A$ and $B$ are observed to be present.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions of probability and conditional independence, compute the posterior probability that the infection is due to Plasmodium ovale given the observed features $A$ and $B$. Express your answer as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of medical parasitology, mathematically well-posed, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. All necessary data, including prior probabilities and conditional likelihoods, are provided to determine a unique solution.\n\nLet $O$ denote the event that the infection is due to *Plasmodium ovale* and $V$ denote the event that it is due to *Plasmodium vivax*. Let $A$ be the event corresponding to the presence of an oval red blood cell (RBC) with fimbriation, and let $B$ be the event corresponding to the observation of a mature schizont with at most $12$ merozoites.\n\nThe problem provides the following pre-test (prior) probabilities:\n$$ \\Pr(O) = 0.35 $$\n$$ \\Pr(V) = 0.65 $$\nNote that $\\Pr(O) + \\Pr(V) = 0.35 + 0.65 = 1.0$, which confirms that these are the only two possibilities considered.\n\nThe problem also provides the conditional probabilities of observing features $A$ and $B$ given the species, which are the likelihoods:\nFor *P. ovale*: $\\Pr(A \\mid O) = 0.82$ and $\\Pr(B \\mid O) = 0.88$.\nFor *P. vivax*: $\\Pr(A \\mid V) = 0.07$ and $\\Pr(B \\mid V) = 0.20$.\n\nWe are tasked with computing the posterior probability of an infection being due to *P. ovale* given the observation of both features $A$ and $B$. This is denoted as $\\Pr(O \\mid A \\cap B)$.\n\nWe apply Bayes' theorem to find this posterior probability:\n$$ \\Pr(O \\mid A \\cap B) = \\frac{\\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) \\Pr(O)}{\\Pr(A \\cap B)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(A \\cap B)$, represents the total probability of observing both $A$ and $B$. It can be calculated using the law of total probability, marginalizing over the possible species ($O$ and $V$):\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) \\Pr(O) + \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid V) \\Pr(V) $$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into Bayes' theorem yields the full expression:\n$$ \\Pr(O \\mid A \\cap B) = \\frac{\\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) \\Pr(O)}{\\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) \\Pr(O) + \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid V) \\Pr(V)} $$\n\nA key piece of information is the assumption that events $A$ and $B$ are conditionally independent given the true species. This allows us to express the joint conditional probabilities as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) = \\Pr(A \\mid O) \\times \\Pr(B \\mid O) $$\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid V) = \\Pr(A \\mid V) \\times \\Pr(B \\mid V) $$\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values to calculate these joint likelihoods:\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) = 0.82 \\times 0.88 = 0.7216 $$\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid V) = 0.07 \\times 0.20 = 0.0140 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator of the Bayesian formula.\nThe numerator is the joint likelihood for *P. ovale* multiplied by its prior probability:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid O) \\Pr(O) = 0.7216 \\times 0.35 = 0.25256 $$\n\nThe denominator consists of two terms. The first term is identical to the numerator, $0.25256$. The second term is the joint likelihood for *P. vivax* multiplied by its prior probability:\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B \\mid V) \\Pr(V) = 0.0140 \\times 0.65 = 0.0091 $$\n\nThe total probability in the denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$ \\Pr(A \\cap B) = 0.25256 + 0.0091 = 0.26166 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability by dividing the numerator by the denominator:\n$$ \\Pr(O \\mid A \\cap B) = \\frac{0.25256}{0.26166} \\approx 0.965233605... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Pr(O \\mid A \\cap B) \\approx 0.9652 $$\nThis result indicates a very high probability that the patient's relapsing malaria is caused by *Plasmodium ovale*, given the microscopic findings.",

            "problem": "A traveler presents with uncomplicated malaria due to Plasmodium vivax after returning from a region where historical surveillance data indicate the probability of chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium vivax is $0.20$. For Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale, relapses are caused by dormant liver hypnozoites, but symptomatic disease arises from blood-stage schizogony in red blood cells. Blood-stage treatment is chosen to clear circulating asexual parasites; radical cure of hypnozoites is a separate consideration. In chloroquine-sensitive regions, a widely accepted regimen for blood-stage Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale is a total chloroquine base dose of $25$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ over $3$ days, administered as $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $1$, $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $2$, and $5$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $3$.

Based on the fundamental distinctions between blood-stage and liver-stage therapy, the chloroquine-sensitive blood-stage dosing guideline, and the salt-to-base equivalence for the tablet formulation, determine the total number of chloroquine phosphate tablets required to complete the $3$-day blood-stage course for this patient. Express your final answer as a pure number of tablets. No rounding instruction is required if an exact integer is obtained.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be evaluated for its validity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Diagnosis: Uncomplicated malaria due to *Plasmodium vivax*.\n- Source region characteristic: Probability of chloroquine-resistant *P. vivax* is $0.20$.\n- Pathophysiological context: Relapses are caused by liver-stage hypnozoites; symptomatic disease is from blood-stage schizogony. The requested calculation pertains only to blood-stage treatment.\n- Dosing regimen for chloroquine-sensitive *P. vivax* and *P. ovale*: Total dose of $25$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ chloroquine base over $3$ days.\n- Daily dose schedule: $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $1$, $10$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $2$, and $5$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ on day $3$.\n- Patient weight: $60$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Medication formulation: Tablets of $250$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ chloroquine phosphate, equivalent to $150$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ chloroquine base per tablet.\n- Decision rule: Use chloroquine if resistance probability is below $0.30$; otherwise, use an Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is scientifically sound. The pathophysiology of *P. vivax* (blood stages vs. hypnozoites), the standard chloroquine dosing regimens, the concept of regional drug resistance guiding therapy, the switch to ACTs, and the chemical distinction between chloroquine salt (phosphate) and base are all fundamental and correct principles in medical parasitology and clinical pharmacology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary numerical data ($60$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, $25$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ total dose, $150$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ base per tablet) and a clear, unambiguous decision rule to determine the course of action. A unique numerical solution can be determined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical, and scientific language. It is free from subjective claims or bias.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. The daily doses ($10+10+5$) correctly sum to the total dose of $25$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$. All information required for the calculation is provided. The extraneous information regarding hypnozoites serves a valid purpose: to ensure the solver correctly focuses on the blood-stage treatment calculation, which is a critical distinction in practice.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe solution requires a sequence of logical steps: applying the decision rule, calculating the total required dose of chloroquine base, and converting this dose into the number of tablets.\n\n1.  **Apply the Treatment Decision Rule:**\n    Let $P_{res}$ be the probability of chloroquine resistance. The problem states $P_{res} = 0.20$. The decision threshold is $0.30$.\n    Since $0.20 < 0.30$, the specified decision rule indicates that treatment with chloroquine is appropriate. The alternative, ACT, is not to be used. The problem therefore requires calculating the chloroquine dose.\n\n2.  **Calculate the Total Mass of Chloroquine Base:**\n    The dosing is based on the patient's body mass and is specified in terms of chloroquine base.\n    Let the patient's mass be $m = 60$ $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n    Let the total specific dose be $d_{total} = 25$ $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ of chloroquine base.\n    The total required mass of chloroquine base, $M_{base}$, is the product of the specific dose and the patient's mass:\n    $$M_{base} = m \\times d_{total}$$\n    $$M_{base} = 60 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 25 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg} = 1500 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\n    Thus, the patient requires a total of $1500$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ of chloroquine base over the $3$-day course.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Total Number of Tablets:**\n    The available tablets are formulated as chloroquine phosphate, but their effective dose is given by their chloroquine base content. It is critical to use the base content for this calculation, as the dosage was specified in terms of the base.\n    Let the amount of chloroquine base per tablet be $b_{tablet} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n    The total number of tablets, $N_{tablets}$, required to deliver the total mass of chloroquine base is given by the ratio:\n    $$N_{tablets} = \\frac{M_{base}}{b_{tablet}}$$\n    $$N_{tablets} = \\frac{1500 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{150 \\ \\mathrm{mg/tablet}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{tablets}$$\n\n    As a verification step, we can calculate the number of tablets for each day based on the daily dosing schedule.\n    - Day $1$: Dose is $10 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 600 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ base. Number of tablets = $\\frac{600 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{150 \\ \\mathrm{mg/tablet}} = 4$ tablets.\n    - Day $2$: Dose is $10 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 600 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ base. Number of tablets = $\\frac{600 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{150 \\ \\mathrm{mg/tablet}} = 4$ tablets.\n    - Day $3$: Dose is $5 \\ \\mathrm{mg/kg} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ base. Number of tablets = $\\frac{300 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{150 \\ \\mathrm{mg/tablet}} = 2$ tablets.\n    The sum of the tablets administered daily is $4 + 4 + 2 = 10$ tablets, which confirms the total calculation.\n\nThe total number of chloroquine phosphate tablets required to complete the $3$-day course is $10$.",

            "problem": "A clinician seeks to implement safe radical cure for hypnozoite eradication in malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium ovale by using primaquine. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency predisposes to clinically significant oxidative hemolysis when exposed to primaquine. To decide whether a patient should receive primaquine, a point-of-care test is used to classify patients as “deficient” or “non-deficient” with performance described by sensitivity and specificity. Assume the following scientifically grounded modeling assumptions.\n\n1. Let $a$ denote G6PD enzymatic activity as a fraction of the population normal. Clinically significant hemolysis probability under a full primaquine course is modeled as a piecewise function $p_h(a)$ reflecting high risk in severe deficiency that declines to near zero as activity approaches adequacy:\n   - For $a \\in [0,\\,0.1]$, $p_h(a) = 1$.\n   - For $a \\in (0.1,\\,0.3]$, $p_h(a) = \\frac{0.3 - a}{0.2}$.\n   - For $a \\ge 0.3$, $p_h(a) = 0$.\n\n2.

Using sensitivity and specificity:\n- Sensitivity $S$ is the probability of a “deficient” test result given true deficiency. Therefore, the probability of a “non-deficient” test result among truly deficient patients is $1 - S$.\n- Specificity $C$ is the probability of a “non-deficient” test result given true non-deficiency.\n\nHence, the probability that a randomly selected patient is treated is\n$$\nT = w_d\\,(1 - S) + w_n\\,C.\n$$\n\nOnly treated patients can incur hemolysis under primaquine.
