            "introduction": "A hallmark of the immune response to invasive helminth infections like fasciolopsiasis is an increase in a specific type of white blood cell, the eosinophil. Interpreting laboratory results is a key clinical skill, and this practice will guide you through converting absolute cell counts from a blood test into a relative fraction. This exercise  helps bridge the gap between raw laboratory data and a clinically meaningful interpretation of the body's reaction to the parasite.",

            "problem": "An adult patient presents after consuming raw aquatic plants, with clinical features suggestive of intestinal fluke infection by Fasciolopsis buski and laboratory evidence of leukocytosis. A peripheral blood count reports a total white blood cell (WBC) count of $9.0 \\times 10^{9}$ per liter and an absolute eosinophil count of $1.2 \\times 10^{9}$ per liter. Using foundational definitions from hematology and immunoparasitology (cell proportions derived from counts and typical eosinophil response to helminthic tissue invasion), compute the expected eosinophil fraction in peripheral blood. Express the eosinophil fraction as a unit-less decimal (i.e., a fraction of $1$), and round your final answer to three significant figures. Then, based on standard adult reference categories for eosinophilia severity defined by absolute eosinophil count, interpret the degree of eosinophilia in words in your reasoning. Your final answer must be only the numerical fraction.",
            "solution": "The problem posed is a quantitative analysis of hematological data within a clinical parasitology context. The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It requires the application of fundamental definitions from hematology to compute a cell fraction from absolute counts.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the eosinophil fraction in the peripheral blood. This fraction, which we shall denote as $f_{eos}$, is defined as the ratio of the absolute eosinophil count to the total white blood cell (WBC) count.\n\nLet $N_{eos}$ represent the absolute eosinophil count and $N_{WBC}$ represent the total white blood cell count. The values provided in the problem statement are:\n- Total WBC count: $N_{WBC} = 9.0 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ L}^{-1}$\n- Absolute eosinophil count: $N_{eos} = 1.2 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ L}^{-1}$\n\nThe eosinophil fraction, $f_{eos}$, is a dimensionless quantity calculated as:\n$$f_{eos} = \\frac{N_{eos}}{N_{WBC}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this expression yields:\n$$f_{eos} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ L}^{-1}}{9.0 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ L}^{-1}}$$\n\nThe factor of $10^{9}$ and the units of $\\text{L}^{-1}$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to a simple ratio of the numerical coefficients:\n$$f_{eos} = \\frac{1.2}{9.0}$$\n\nThis fraction can be evaluated as a decimal:\n$$f_{eos} = \\frac{1.2}{9.0} = \\frac{12}{90} = \\frac{2}{15} \\approx 0.13333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $1$, $3$, and $3$. The fourth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$f_{eos} \\approx 0.133$$\n\nThis value represents the fraction of total white blood cells that are eosinophils. To express this as a percentage, one would multiply by $100$, resulting in $13.3\\%$.\n\nAdditionally, the problem requests an interpretation of the degree of eosinophilia based on the absolute eosinophil count. The given count is $N_{eos} = 1.2 \\times 10^{9} \\text{ L}^{-1}$. Standard clinical hematology defines eosinophilia severity in adults based on the absolute count, typically measured in cells per microliter (cells/µL). Since $1 \\text{ L} = 10^{6} \\text{ µL}$, we can convert the units:\n$$N_{eos} = 1.2 \\times 10^{9} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{10^{6} \\text{ µL}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{3} \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{µL}} = 1200 \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\text{µL}}$$\nStandard adult reference categories for eosinophilia are:\n- Normal: $ 500$ cells/µL (or $ 0.5 \\times 10^{9}$ cells/L)\n- Mild: $500 - 1500$ cells/µL (or $0.5 - 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$ cells/L)\n- Moderate: $1500 - 5000$ cells/µL (or $1.5 - 5.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cells/L)\n- Severe: $ 5000$ cells/µL (or $ 5.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cells/L)\n\nThe patient's absolute eosinophil count of $1200$ cells/µL falls within the range for **mild eosinophilia**. This finding is consistent with the host immune response to a helminthic infection such as fasciolopsiasis, as parasitic invasion of tissues or mucosal surfaces characteristically elicits an increase in circulating eosinophils.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiology and medical diagnostics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with the derivation of the positive predictive values (PPV).\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has active fasciolopsiasis, and let $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result. The problem provides the following information:\n\nThe prevalence of the disease, $P(D)$, is given as $0.25$.\n$$P(D) = 0.25$$\nFrom this, the probability of not having the disease is:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75$$\n\nThe diagnostic characteristics of the two tests are:\n\nFor the ELISA test:\nThe sensitivity, $Se_{ELISA}$, is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present:\n$$Se_{ELISA} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.88$$\nThe specificity, $Sp_{ELISA}$, is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent:\n$$Sp_{ELISA} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nFor the PCR test:\nThe sensitivity, $Se_{PCR}$, is:\n$$Se_{PCR} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$$\nThe specificity, $Sp_{PCR}$, is:\n$$Sp_{PCR} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.98$$\n\nThe quantity to be derived is the positive predictive value, $PPV$, which is the probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to define the $PPV$:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n\nThe term $P(T^+ | D)$ is the sensitivity, $Se$. The term $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the false positive rate, which is equal to $1 - Sp$, where $Sp$ is the specificity. Substituting these into the law of total probability gives:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot P(D^c))$$\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of $P(T^+)$ back into the Bayes' theorem expression for $PPV$ yields the general formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot P(D)}{(Se \\cdot P(D)) + ((1 - Sp) \\cdot (1 - P(D)))}$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to each test, using the respective sensitivity and specificity values.\n\nCalculation for the ELISA test:\nWe substitute $Se_{ELISA} = 0.88$, $Sp_{ELISA} = 0.95$, and $P(D) = 0.25$ into the formula.\n$$PPV_{ELISA} = \\frac{0.88 \\cdot 0.25}{(0.88 \\cdot 0.25) + ((1 - 0.95) \\cdot (1 - 0.25))}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n$$0.88 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.22$$\n$$(1 - 0.95) \\cdot (1 - 0.25) = 0.05 \\cdot 0.75 = 0.0375$$\nSubstituting these values back:\n$$PPV_{ELISA} = \\frac{0.22}{0.22 + 0.0375} = \\frac{0.22}{0.2575}$$\n$$PPV_{ELISA} \\approx 0.854368932...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV_{ELISA} \\approx 0.8544$$\n\nCalculation for the PCR test:\nWe substitute $Se_{PCR} = 0.92$, $Sp_{PCR} = 0.98$, and $P(D) = 0.25$ into the formula.\n$$PPV_{PCR} = \\frac{0.92 \\cdot 0.25}{(0.92 \\cdot 0.25) + ((1 - 0.98) \\cdot (1 - 0.25))}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator:\n$$0.92 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.23$$\n$$(1 - 0.98) \\cdot (1 - 0.25) = 0.02 \\cdot 0.75 = 0.015$$\nSubstituting these values back:\n$$PPV_{PCR} = \\frac{0.23}{0.23 + 0.015} = \\frac{0.23}{0.245}$$\n$$PPV_{PCR} \\approx 0.938775510...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$PPV_{PCR} \\approx 0.9388$$\n\nThe positive predictive values for the ELISA and PCR tests are approximately $0.8544$ and $0.9388$, respectively.",
