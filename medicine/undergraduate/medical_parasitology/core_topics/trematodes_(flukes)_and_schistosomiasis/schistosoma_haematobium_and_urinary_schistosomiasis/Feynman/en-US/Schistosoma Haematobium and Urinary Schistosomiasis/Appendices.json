            "problem": "A field laboratory is quantifying the intensity of infection with the blood fluke Schistosoma haematobium in a patient by counting eggs in urine using the standard filtration of a $10$ milliliter aliquot. The lab technician notes that hydration status may alter urine volume and therefore the measured egg concentration. Assume the following well-tested facts and definitions in medical parasitology: (i) over a short, fixed sampling window of duration $T$, the egg excretion rate is approximately constant, so the total eggs voided $E$ in that window satisfy $E = r T$ for some rate $r$; (ii) concentration is defined by $c = E / V$, where $V$ is the total urine volume for the void over the sampling window; and (iii) the measured count $n$ obtained from a single well-mixed $10$ milliliter aliquot equals $n = c \\times 10$ milliliters.\n\nThe same patient provides two mid-day voids collected over equal fixed durations $T$ on two consecutive days:\n\n- Day $1$ (well hydrated): total urine volume $V_{1} = 600$ milliliters; measured eggs in a $10$ milliliter aliquot $n_{1} = 18$.\n- Day $2$ (dehydrated): total urine volume $V_{2} = 240$ milliliters; measured eggs in a $10$ milliliter aliquot $n_{2} = 45$.\n\nAssuming $E$ is the same across the two days because $T$ is the same and the egg excretion rate is constant over $T$, use only the fundamental definitions above to infer the void-specific total egg output $E$ and then compute the dilution-corrected expected aliquot count $n_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ that would be observed if the same void had instead a reference total volume $V_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 400$ milliliters. Express your final result as eggs per $10$ milliliters and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The starting point is the definition of concentration and the conservation of total egg number in a fixed sampling window. Let $E$ denote the total number of eggs voided in the sampling window of duration $T$. Let $V$ denote the total urine volume produced over that window. By the definition of concentration,\n$$\nc = \\frac{E}{V}.\n$$\nThe laboratory procedure counts eggs in a well-mixed aliquot of $10$ milliliters. If the sample is well mixed, the expected number of eggs in a $10$ milliliter aliquot, $n$, is\n$$\nn = c \\times 10 = \\left(\\frac{E}{V}\\right) \\times 10.\n$$\nSolving this for $E$ in terms of $n$ and $V$ gives\n$$\nE = \\frac{n}{10} \\times V.\n$$\n\nUnder the assumption that the sampling duration $T$ is the same for both days and that the egg excretion rate is approximately constant over $T$, the total number of eggs voided $E$ is the same for both days. We can compute $E$ from either day using the relation above.\n\nFor Day $1$,\n$$\nE_{1} = \\frac{n_{1}}{10} \\times V_{1} = \\frac{18}{10} \\times 600 = 1.8 \\times 600 = 1080.\n$$\n\nFor Day $2$,\n$$\nE_{2} = \\frac{n_{2}}{10} \\times V_{2} = \\frac{45}{10} \\times 240 = 4.5 \\times 240 = 1080.\n$$\n\nThese agree, consistent with the assumption, so we take $E = 1080$ eggs per void for the sampling window.\n\nTo compute the expected $10$ milliliter aliquot count at the reference volume $V_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 400$ milliliters, we use\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\left(\\frac{E}{V_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\times 10 = \\left(\\frac{1080}{400}\\right) \\times 10.\n$$\nCompute the quotient:\n$$\n\\frac{1080}{400} = 2.7,\n$$\nso\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2.7 \\times 10 = 27.\n$$\n\nRounded to three significant figures, $27$ becomes $27.0$. Interpreting hydration effects, this shows that the measured eggs per $10$ milliliters scale inversely with total urine volume for a fixed total egg output; dilution correction via $n = (E/V)\\times 10$ standardizes the analytical interpretation to a reference volume.",

            "problem": "A field team in an endemic region evaluates urinary tract morbidity associated with Schistosoma haematobium using ultrasound. Chronic deposition of Schistosoma haematobium eggs causes inflammatory granulomas, submucosal fibrosis, and obstructive changes that manifest as bladder wall thickening, intravesical masses, and ureteral dilation. Ultrasound-based classification of morbidity relies on thresholds that indicate pathologic changes consistent with the World Health Organization (WHO) Niamey protocol for urinary schistosomiasis, such as a bladder wall thickness threshold near $5$ mm (in a partially filled bladder) and recognition that dilated ureters reflect obstructive uropathy.\n\nConsider the following standardized composite morbidity score $S$, defined as the sum of three components, each grounded in these established ultrasound thresholds:\n\n1. Bladder wall thickness component $S_{w}$ (assessed with a partially filled bladder):\n   - If thickness $t \\leq 5$ mm, $S_{w} = 0$.\n   - If $5 < t \\leq 7$ mm, $S_{w} = 2$.\n   - If $7 < t \\leq 10$ mm, $S_{w} = 4$.\n   - If $t > 10$ mm, $S_{w} = 6$.\n\n2.

Distal ureteral dilation component $S_{u}$ (maximum distal ureteral diameter on either side):\n   - If diameter $d \\leq 5$ mm, $S_{u} = 0$.\n   - If $5 < d \\leq 7$ mm, $S_{u} = 3$.\n   - If $d > 7$ mm, $S_{u} = 6$.\n\nTotal score is $S = S_{w} + S_{m} + S_{u}$, and disease severity is classified as:\n- Mild: $0 \\leq S \\leq 5$,\n- Moderate: $6 \\leq S \\leq 11$,\n- Severe: $S \\geq 12$.\n\nA $16$-year-old adolescent presents with terminal hematuria.

Report only the numerical value of $S$ as your final answer (unitless). No rounding is required because $S$ is an integer by construction.",
            "solution": "The fundamental basis for ultrasound morbidity assessment in urinary schistosomiasis is that Schistosoma haematobium eggs deposited in the bladder wall induce inflammation, granuloma formation, and fibrosis, which manifest as bladder wall thickening and intravesical lesions, while obstructive changes can cause ureteral dilation. The World Health Organization (WHO) Niamey protocol uses a bladder wall thickness threshold near $5$ mm (in a partially filled bladder) to indicate pathologic thickening, and ureteral dilation reflects obstructive uropathy. The score $S$ defined in the problem leverages these established thresholds and assigns discrete points to stratify morbidity severity.\n\nWe compute each component:\n\n1.

            "problem": "In urinary schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium, egg excretion varies by time of day, with higher excretion near midday. In a limited-resource survey using urine filtration microscopy, assume that for a single infected participant the mean true egg concentration in urine over three disjoint collection windows is approximately constant within each window, with values (from a pilot study) of $c_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.5$ eggs per $10$ milliliters, $c_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 5.0$ eggs per $10$ milliliters, and $c_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.8$ eggs per $10$ milliliters. Each field sample is exactly $10$ milliliters, and the filter has an egg retention efficiency of $\\eta = 0.75$. The number of eggs retained on the filter from any one sample collected in window $w$ is modeled as a Poisson random variable with mean $\\mu_{w}$, where $\\mu_{w}$ equals the expected number of eggs entering the filter multiplied by the retention efficiency. Samples collected in different windows are independent conditional on their means.

You may choose the remaining sample or samples in any window while respecting these constraints.\n\nUsing only these assumptions and fundamental properties of the Poisson distribution and independence, first compute the expected retained egg count per single $10$ milliliter sample for each window. Then determine the sampling allocation that maximizes the detection probability for this participant under the stated constraints, and compute the maximum achievable detection probability under that allocation. Express the final detection probability as a unitless decimal, and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The first step is to compute the expected number of eggs retained on the filter per single $10$ milliliter sample for each of the three collection windows. This is the mean, $\\mu_w$, of the Poisson distribution for a sample from window $w$. The problem states that $\\mu_w$ is the product of the true mean egg concentration, $c_w$, and the filter retention efficiency, $\\eta$.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Morning concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.5$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Midday concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 5.0$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Evening concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.8$ eggs per $10$ mL\n- Filter retention efficiency: $\\eta = 0.75$\n\nThe expected retained egg counts per sample are:\nFor the morning window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} = c_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\times \\eta = 1.5 \\times 0.75 = 1.125\n$$\nFor the midday window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} = c_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\times \\eta = 5.0 \\times 0.75 = 3.75\n$$\nFor the evening window:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}} = c_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\times \\eta = 0.8 \\times 0.75 = 0.6\n$$\n\nA participant is classified as detected-positive if at least one egg is observed across all collected samples. Let $n_{\\mathrm{morning}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{midday}}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{evening}}$ be the number of samples collected in the morning, midday, and evening windows, respectively. Let $X_i$ be the number of eggs counted in the $i$-th sample, where $X_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\mu_i)$, with $\\mu_i$ being the appropriate mean for the window in which sample $i$ was collected.\n\nDue to the property that the sum of independent Poisson random variables is also a Poisson random variable, the total number of eggs observed, $S$, across all samples follows a Poisson distribution with a mean, $\\lambda$, equal to the sum of the means of the individual samples.\n$$\nS \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)\n$$\nwhere\n$$\n\\lambda = n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}\n$$\nThe probability of detecting the infection is the probability of observing at least one egg, $P(S > 0)$. This is the complement of observing zero eggs, $P(S=0)$. For a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, the probability of observing $k$ events is $P(S=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$.\nTherefore, $P(S=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$. The detection probability, $P_{\\text{detect}}$, is:\n$$\nP_{\\text{detect}} = P(S > 0) = 1 - P(S=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nTo maximize the detection probability, we must maximize the value of $\\lambda$, since $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$ is a monotonically increasing function of $\\lambda$ for $\\lambda \\ge 0$. The task reduces to an optimization problem: maximize $\\lambda$ subject to the given logistical constraints.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  Total number of samples: $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} \\le 3$\n2.  Midday samples: $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$\n3.  Morning samples: $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$\n4.  Non-negativity: $n_{\\mathrm{morning}}, n_{\\mathrm{midday}}, n_{\\mathrm{evening}}$ are non-negative integers.\n\nTo maximize the linear combination $\\lambda = n_{\\mathrm{morning}}(1.125) + n_{\\mathrm{midday}}(3.75) + n_{\\mathrm{evening}}(0.6)$, we should allocate samples to the windows with the highest $\\mu_w$ values, respecting the constraints. The order of the means is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}$. Furthermore, to maximize $\\lambda$, we should use the maximum total number of samples allowed, which is $3$. So, $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} + n_{\\mathrm{midday}} + n_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 3$.\n\nWe apply a greedy strategy:\n1.  The window with the highest mean is midday ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 3.75$). The constraint is $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$. To maximize $\\lambda$, we should choose $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 1$. This uses $1$ of our $3$ samples.\n2.  The problem requires at least one morning sample ($n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$). Since we have not yet allocated a morning sample, we must allocate at least one. This uses a second sample.\n3.  We have used $2$ samples and have $1$ remaining sample to allocate. The required constraints ($n_{\\mathrm{midday}}=1$, $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$) are satisfied. The remaining choices for the third sample are an additional morning sample or an evening sample. Comparing their means, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 1.125$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0.6$. Since $\\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}} > \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}}$, we allocate the final sample to the morning window to maximize $\\lambda$.\n\nThis results in the optimal sampling allocation:\n- $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} = 2$ samples\n- $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} = 1$ sample\n- $n_{\\mathrm{evening}} = 0$ samples\n\nLet's verify this allocation against the constraints:\n- Total samples: $2 + 1 + 0 = 3$. This satisfies $n_{\\text{total}} \\le 3$.\n- Midday samples: $1$. This satisfies $n_{\\mathrm{midday}} \\le 1$.\n- Morning samples: $2$. This satisfies $n_{\\mathrm{morning}} \\ge 1$.\nThe allocation is valid.\n\nNow, we compute the maximum total mean, $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$, for this optimal allocation:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = (2 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{morning}}) + (1 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{midday}}) + (0 \\times \\mu_{\\mathrm{evening}})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{max}} = (2 \\times 1.125) + (1 \\times 3.75) + 0 = 2.25 + 3.75 = 6.0\n$$\nFinally, we compute the maximum achievable detection probability using this value of $\\lambda_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{max}}) = 1 - \\exp(-6.0)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} \\approx 1 - 0.0024787521... = 0.997521247...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nP_{\\text{max}} \\approx 0.9975\n$$",
