This exercise demonstrates how to use Bayes' theorem to determine the true probability of having cutaneous leishmaniasis after receiving a positive smear result . By integrating the test's known accuracy with the disease's prevalence in the population, we can move beyond a simple 'positive' or 'negative' and quantify our diagnostic certainty, a core skill in evidence-based medicine.",

            "problem": "A clinician practicing in an endemic region suspects cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in a patient presenting with a painless ulcer. The clinician orders a Giemsa-stained smear microscopy for amastigotes. Assume that the test has sensitivity $0.70$ and specificity $0.95$ for detecting CL in lesion smears in this setting. Based on local epidemiological data for similar patients, the pretest probability of CL is $0.30$. The patient’s smear returns positive.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and standard definitions of sensitivity and specificity as conditional probabilities, derive from first principles the expression for the post-test probability that the patient truly has CL given the positive smear result, and compute its value for the parameters above. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "We begin by formalizing the events and probabilities. Let $D$ denote the event that the patient truly has cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), and let $T$ denote the event that the smear test result is positive. The pretest (prior) probability is $P(D)=0.30$, so $P(\\neg D)=1-P(D)=0.70$.\n\nBy definition, the sensitivity is the conditional probability of a positive test given disease:\n$$\\text{sensitivity} = P(T \\mid D) = 0.70.$$\nThe specificity is the conditional probability of a negative test given no disease:\n$$\\text{specificity} = P(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 0.95.$$\nTherefore, the false positive probability is\n$$P(T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05.$$\n\nBy Bayes’ theorem, the post-test (posterior) probability of disease given a positive result is\n$$P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{P(T \\mid D) \\, P(D)}{P(T \\mid D)\\, P(D) + P(T \\mid \\neg D)\\, P(\\neg D)}.$$\n\nSubstituting the given values,\n$$P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{0.70 \\times 0.30}{0.70 \\times 0.30 + 0.05 \\times 0.70}.$$\n\nCompute the numerator:\n$$0.70 \\times 0.30 = 0.21.$$\n\nCompute the denominator:\n$$0.70 \\times 0.30 + 0.05 \\times 0.70 = 0.21 + 0.035 = 0.245.$$\n\nThus,\n$$P(D \\mid T) = \\frac{0.21}{0.245} = \\frac{21}{24.5} = \\frac{210}{245} = \\frac{6}{7}.$$\n\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{6}{7}$ equals $0.857142\\ldots$.

Consider a preparation labeled as $100$ milligrams antimony in the pentavalent form per milliliter (pentavalent antimonial, SbV), supplied in $5$ milliliters (mL) per vial. The patient weighs $50$ kilograms (kg). The planned regimen is $20$ milligrams (mg) of SbV per kilogram per day for $20$ days.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard pharmaceutical practice, well-posed with all necessary information, and presented objectively. We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimal whole number of vials required for a complete course of treatment. This requires a multi-step calculation starting from the patient's weight and the prescribed dosing regimen.\n\nLet us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- Patient's weight: $W = 50 \\text{ kg}$\n- Prescribed dose rate: $D_r = 20 \\frac{\\text{mg SbV}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$\n- Duration of treatment: $T = 20 \\text{ days}$\n- Wastage factor: $f_w = 0.10$ (dimensionless)\n- Drug concentration per vial: $C = 100 \\frac{\\text{mg SbV}}{\\text{mL}}$\n- Volume per vial: $V_{\\text{vial}} = 5 \\text{ mL}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the daily dose of the pentavalent antimonial ($SbV$) required for the patient.

This is the product of the daily dose and the duration of the treatment.\n$$\n\\text{Total Course Dose} = \\text{Daily Dose} \\times T\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated daily dose and the given duration:\n$$\n\\text{Total Course Dose} = 1000 \\frac{\\text{mg SbV}}{\\text{day}} \\times 20 \\text{ days} = 20000 \\text{ mg SbV}\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies a wastage factor, $f_w$, of $0.10$. This factor accounts for drug loss during preparation and administration. The total amount of drug that must be dispensed by the pharmacy must be increased by this factor. The total required amount, $A_{\\text{req}}$, is therefore the total course dose multiplied by $(1 + f_w)$.\n$$\nA_{\\text{req}} = (\\text{Total Course Dose}) \\times (1 + f_w)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nA_{\\text{req}} = 20000 \\text{ mg SbV} \\times (1 + 0.10) = 20000 \\text{ mg SbV} \\times 1.1 = 22000 \\text{ mg SbV}\n$$\n\nNow, we must determine the amount of $SbV$ contained in a single vial. This is the product of the drug concentration and the volume of the vial.\n$$\n\\text{Amount per Vial} = C \\times V_{\\text{vial}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given vial parameters:\n$$\n\\text{Amount per Vial} = 100 \\frac{\\text{mg SbV}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 5 \\text{ mL} = 500 \\text{ mg SbV}\n$$\n\nFinally, to find the number of vials needed, $N_{\\text{vials}}$, we divide the total required amount of $SbV$ by the amount of $SbV$ per vial.\n$$\nN_{\\text{vials}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{req}}}{\\text{Amount per Vial}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nN_{\\text{vials}} = \\frac{22000 \\text{ mg SbV}}{500 \\text{ mg SbV}} = \\frac{220}{5} = 44\n$$\n\nThe problem provides a specific rounding rule: \"If your computation yields a fractional vial count, round up to the next whole vial; otherwise, report the exact integer.\" Since the calculated number of vials, $44$, is an exact integer, no rounding is necessary. The minimal whole number of vials required is $44$.",

            "problem": "In a longitudinal study of cutaneous leishmaniasis lesion healing under standard therapy, serial caliper measurements of lesion diameter are recorded to quantify treatment response. Assume that, over relatively short follow-up (weeks) and under stable host and treatment conditions, the instantaneous rate of change of the lesion diameter $L(t)$ is proportional to the current diameter. This first-order healing assumption is expressed by the differential equation $\\frac{dL}{dt}=-k\\,L$, where $k>0$ is the healing rate constant and $t$ is time in days. A patient’s lesion diameter is measured as $L(0)=30$ mm at treatment initiation and $L(56)=12$ mm after $56$ days ($8$ weeks).

This is a standard and scientifically sound approximation for many biological processes, including wound healing, under simplified assumptions. The context of cutaneous leishmaniasis is appropriate for a medical biophysics problem.

It is deemed **valid**. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires us to solve the differential equation that models the healing of the lesion. The governing equation is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = -k L(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. It is also a separable equation. To solve it, we separate the variables $L$ and $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L} dL = -k dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. Since the lesion diameter $L$ is a physical quantity, it must be positive, so we can integrate from the initial diameter $L_0 = L(0)$ to a diameter $L(t)$ at a later time $t$.\n$$\n\\int_{L_0}^{L(t)} \\frac{1}{L'} dL' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(L')]_{L_0}^{L(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(L(t)) - \\ln(L_0) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{L(t)}{L_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo find the explicit form for $L(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{L(t)}{L_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThus, the general solution for $L(t)$ is:\n$$\nL(t) = L_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem provides the initial condition $L(0) = 30$ mm. Substituting $L_0 = 30$, we obtain the specific form of $L(t)$ for this patient:\n$$\nL(t) = 30 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis expression represents the diameter of the lesion as a function of time, as requested. Next, we must determine the value of the healing rate constant $k$. We are given a second data point: at $t=56$ days, the diameter is $L(56)=12$ mm. We substitute these values into our equation for $L(t)$:\n$$\n12 = 30 \\exp(-k \\cdot 56)\n$$\nTo solve for $k$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(-56k) = \\frac{12}{30} = \\frac{2}{5}\n$$\nNow, we take the natural logarithm of both sides to solve for the exponent:\n$$\n\\ln(\\exp(-56k)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-56k = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)\n$$\nWe can use the logarithm property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$ to simplify the expression:\n$$\n-56k = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n56k = \\ln(2.5)\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $k$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\ln(2.5)}{56}\n$$\nThe units of $t$ are days, so the units of $k$ are day$^{-1}$. Now, we calculate the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as required.\nUsing a calculator for the value of the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln(2.5) \\approx 0.9162907\n$$\n$$\nk \\approx \\frac{0.9162907}{56} \\approx 0.016362334\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nk \\approx 0.01636\n$$",
