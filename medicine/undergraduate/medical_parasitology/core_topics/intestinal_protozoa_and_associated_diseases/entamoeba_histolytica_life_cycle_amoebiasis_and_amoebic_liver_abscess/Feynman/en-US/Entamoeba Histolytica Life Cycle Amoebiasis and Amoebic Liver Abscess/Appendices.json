            "introduction": "The accuracy of a diagnostic test is often described by its sensitivity and specificity, which are intrinsic characteristics. However, a test's true clinical utility is determined by its predictive values—the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)—which are heavily influenced by the prevalence of the disease in the population being tested. This exercise  demonstrates how the performance of a highly accurate PCR assay for *Entamoeba histolytica* changes dramatically across different clinical settings, from general screening to an outbreak investigation.",

            "problem": "A hospital parasitology laboratory is evaluating a real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay for detection of Entamoeba histolytica deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in stool. The assay has sensitivity $Se = 0.98$ and specificity $Sp = 0.97$.

It presents a standard application of Bayesian probability theory to the evaluation of a medical diagnostic test, a common task in epidemiology and laboratory medicine.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n$D$: The event that a randomly selected individual from the population has the disease (infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*).\n$D^c$: The event that the individual does not have the disease.\n$T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n$T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following information, which we translate into probabilistic terms:\nThe prevalence of the disease is $p$, so the prior probability of having the disease is $P(D) = p$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - p$.\n\nThe sensitivity of the assay is $Se = 0.98$. Sensitivity is defined as the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease.\n$$Se = P(T^+ | D) = 0.98$$\nFrom this, we can deduce the probability of a false negative, which is the probability of a negative test given that the individual has the disease:\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$$\n\nThe specificity of the assay is $Sp = 0.97$. Specificity is defined as the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disease.\n$$Sp = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.97$$\nFrom this, we can deduce the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test given that the individual does not have the disease:\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$$\n\nThe first task is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$).\n\n$PPV$ is the probability that an individual with a positive test result actually has the disease. This is the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to derive its expression:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. We find it using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $P(T^+)$ back into the formula for $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\nThis is the general expression for $PPV$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n\n$NPV$ is the probability that an individual with a negative test result is actually disease-free. This is the conditional probability $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test result. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$P(T^-) = (1 - Se)(p) + (Sp)(1 - p)$$\nNow, substituting this expression for $P(T^-)$ back into the formula for $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - Se) \\cdot p}$$\nThis is the general expression for $NPV$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate $PPV$ and $NPV$ for each given prevalence $p \\in \\{0.05, 0.20, 0.50\\}$, using $Se=0.98$ and $Sp=0.97$.\n\nCase 1: Prevalence $p = 0.05$\n$$PPV(p=0.05) = \\frac{(0.98)(0.05)}{(0.98)(0.05) + (1 - 0.97)(1 - 0.05)} = \\frac{0.049}{0.049 + (0.03)(0.95)} = \\frac{0.049}{0.049 + 0.0285} = \\frac{0.049}{0.0775} \\approx 0.632258...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV(p=0.05) = 0.6323$.\n$$NPV(p=0.05) = \\frac{(0.97)(1 - 0.05)}{(0.97)(1 - 0.05) + (1 - 0.98)(0.05)} = \\frac{(0.97)(0.95)}{(0.97)(0.95) + (0.02)(0.05)} = \\frac{0.9215}{0.9215 + 0.001} = \\frac{0.9215}{0.9225} \\approx 0.9989159...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV(p=0.05) = 0.9989$.\n\nCase 2: Prevalence $p = 0.20$\n$$PPV(p=0.20) = \\frac{(0.98)(0.20)}{(0.98)(0.20) + (0.03)(1 - 0.20)} = \\frac{0.196}{0.196 + (0.03)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.196}{0.196 + 0.024} = \\frac{0.196}{0.220} \\approx 0.890909...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV(p=0.20) = 0.8909$.\n$$NPV(p=0.20) = \\frac{(0.97)(1 - 0.20)}{(0.97)(1 - 0.20) + (0.02)(0.20)} = \\frac{(0.97)(0.80)}{(0.97)(0.80) + 0.004} = \\frac{0.776}{0.776 + 0.004} = \\frac{0.776}{0.780} \\approx 0.994871...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV(p=0.20) = 0.9949$.\n\nCase 3: Prevalence $p = 0.50$\n$$PPV(p=0.50) = \\frac{(0.98)(0.50)}{(0.98)(0.50) + (0.03)(1 - 0.50)} = \\frac{0.49}{0.49 + (0.03)(0.50)} = \\frac{0.49}{0.49 + 0.015} = \\frac{0.49}{0.505} \\approx 0.970297...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV(p=0.50) = 0.9703$.\n$$NPV(p=0.50) = \\frac{(0.97)(1 - 0.50)}{(0.97)(1 - 0.50) + (0.02)(0.50)} = \\frac{(0.97)(0.50)}{(0.97)(0.50) + 0.01} = \\frac{0.485}{0.485 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.485}{0.495} \\approx 0.979797...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV(p=0.50) = 0.9798$.\n\nThe final results are compiled into a single row matrix as requested.

The volume $V$ of a sphere with radius $r$ is given by the standard geometric formula:\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$$\nThe problem provides the maximal diameters ($d$) of the lesions, not the radii.
