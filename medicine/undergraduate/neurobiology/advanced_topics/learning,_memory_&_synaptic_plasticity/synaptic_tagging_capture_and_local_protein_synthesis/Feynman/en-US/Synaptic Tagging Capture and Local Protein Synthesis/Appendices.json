            "introduction": "The Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis elegantly solves the puzzle of how a neuron-wide signal can lead to synapse-specific strengthening. This first practice exercise asks you to apply the core principle of STC: the distinction between setting a local \"tag\" and triggering the global synthesis of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). By considering why a weak stimulus fails to induce long-lasting changes on its own, you will solidify your understanding of the two-factor requirement for memory consolidation .",

            "problem": "A neuroscientist is investigating synaptic plasticity in an isolated hippocampal neuron. They apply a weak tetanic stimulation (WTS) to a single dendritic spine, which we'll call Synapse A. This stimulation is sufficient to induce a temporary increase in synaptic strength, known as early-phase Long-Term Potentiation (E-LTP), which fades away after approximately two hours. According to the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis, this weak stimulation successfully creates a \"synaptic tag\" at Synapse A. However, the more permanent, protein synthesis-dependent late-phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP) does not occur.\n\nAccording to the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis, which of the following is the primary reason that the weak stimulation at Synapse A, by itself, is insufficient to induce L-LTP?\n\nA. The WTS is insufficient to trigger the somatic synthesis of new plasticity-related proteins (PRPs) necessary for the structural and functional changes of L-LTP.\n\nB. The WTS fails to generate a synaptic tag at Synapse A; tags are only created by strong, L-LTP-inducing stimuli.\n\nC. The E-LTP induced by the WTS is mediated by a different set of receptors than L-LTP, making the synapse ineligible for protein capture.\n\nD. The WTS activates local protein degradation pathways that immediately destroy the synaptic tag before any proteins can be captured.\n\nE. The WTS does not lead to the initial influx of calcium through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors required for any form of potentiation.",
            "solution": "We apply the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis. The key principles are:\n- A weak tetanic stimulation (WTS) at a synapse can induce early-phase LTP (E-LTP) and set a synaptic tag at that synapse.\n- Late-phase LTP (L-LTP) requires newly synthesized plasticity-related proteins (PRPs), typically generated by strong stimulation that engages somatic transcription and translation processes. These PRPs are then available for capture by tagged synapses to stabilize long-term changes.\n- A weak stimulation alone generally does not trigger the somatic synthesis of PRPs; thus, although a tag is set, there are no PRPs to capture, and only E-LTP is expressed and then decays.\n\nApplying this to Synapse A:\n- The WTS is sufficient to create a synaptic tag and induce E-LTP that fades after approximately two hours, consistent with the absence of PRP capture.\n- Since no strong, protein-synthesis-inducing event occurred, the pool of PRPs is not generated, and L-LTP is not established at Synapse A.\n\nEvaluate options:\n- A is correct: WTS fails to trigger somatic synthesis of PRPs, so the tag cannot capture proteins and L-LTP does not occur.\n- B is incorrect: weak stimulation can create synaptic tags; tags are not exclusive to strong stimuli.\n- C is incorrect: eligibility for capture is determined by the tag, not a fundamentally different receptor set for E-LTP versus L-LTP.\n- D is incorrect: the hypothesis does not posit that weak stimulation activates immediate tag-destroying degradation; rather, the limitation is lack of PRPs.\n- E is incorrect: E-LTP did occur, implying the necessary NMDA receptor-mediated calcium influx was present.\n\nTherefore, the primary reason is the lack of PRP synthesis following WTS.",

This practice delves into the \"capture\" mechanism, exploring the critical role of local protein synthesis in consolidating long-term potentiation.

            "problem": "The Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) hypothesis provides a framework for understanding how synapses are selectively strengthened during learning and memory. This process underlies the consolidation of Late-Phase Long-Term Potentiation (L-LTP), a persistent, protein synthesis-dependent increase in synaptic efficacy. The hypothesis posits that a \"weak\" synaptic stimulation can create a local, transient \"synaptic tag.\" If a \"strong\" stimulation occurs elsewhere in the same neuron within a certain time window, the neuron's soma synthesizes a pool of Plasticity-Related Products (PRPs). These PRPs, which include key messenger RNAs (mRNAs), diffuse throughout the dendritic tree and are \"captured\" by any tagged synapse, enabling its conversion to L-LTP.\n\nConsider a model pyramidal neuron with two independent, spatially separate dendritic spines, Spine A and Spine B.\n- At time $t=0$, Spine A receives a weak tetanic stimulation. This stimulation is sufficient to induce a synaptic tag but is too weak to trigger the somatic synthesis of PRPs or to induce L-LTP on its own.\n- At time $t=45$ minutes, Spine B receives a strong tetanic stimulation, which is sufficient to induce L-LTP at Spine B and to initiate the transcription and translation of PRPs in the cell's soma.\n- Crucially, an experimental compound that selectively and irreversibly deactivates all ribosomal subunits has been microinjected into the dendritic shaft supporting Spine A prior to the experiment. This compound is localized and does not affect ribosomes in the soma, in the dendrite supporting Spine B, or anywhere else in the neuron. All other cellular machinery, including mRNA transport and the tagging mechanism itself, remains fully functional.\n\nBased on the principles of the Synaptic Tagging and Capture hypothesis, what is the most likely fate of the synaptic potentiation at Spine A several hours after the stimulation protocol?\n\nA. Spine A will fail to show any potentiation, as the deactivated ribosomes prevent the formation of the synaptic tag.\n\nB. Spine A will exhibit robust and stable L-LTP, as the necessary PRP-encoding mRNAs from the soma are successfully captured by the tag.\n\nC. Spine A will exhibit an initial, transient potentiation that decays back to its baseline state, failing to consolidate into L-LTP.\n\nD. Spine A will exhibit robust and stable L-LTP, as fully-formed PRP proteins synthesized in the soma will diffuse to and be utilized by the tagged synapse.\n\nE. Both Spine A and Spine B will fail to consolidate L-LTP due to a retrograde signal from the deactivated ribosomes at Spine A that inhibits global protein synthesis.",
            "solution": "We model the events using the Synaptic Tagging and Capture (STC) framework.\n\n1) Weak stimulation at Spine A at $t=0$ sets a synaptic tag without requiring new protein synthesis. Denote the tag at A by $T_{A}(t)$, with $T_{A}(t)>0$ for $0 \\le t \\le \\tau_{\\text{tag}}$ and $T_{A}(t)=0$ for $t>\\tau_{\\text{tag}}$. Formation of $T_{A}(t)$ does not depend on ribosomal function, so local ribosomal deactivation does not prevent tagging.\n\n2) Strong stimulation at Spine B at $t=t_{s}$ with $t_{s}=45$ minutes induces L-LTP at B and triggers somatic synthesis of plasticity-related products (PRPs). Let the somatic PRP pool be $P(t)$, which increases after $t_{s}$ and diffuses into dendrites. STC posits that tagged synapses capture PRPs, giving an effective availability at A of $C_{A}(t)=T_{A}(t)P(t)$ during the tag’s lifetime if transport is intact. The problem states that mRNA transport and tagging remain fully functional, so capture can occur in principle.\n\n3) Consolidation of L-LTP at a tagged synapse requires translation of captured PRP-encoding mRNAs or utilization of locally available protein PRPs to produce the effectors that stabilize potentiation. Denote the local translation capacity at A by $r_{A}$. The irreversible deactivation of all ribosomal subunits in the dendritic shaft supporting Spine A implies $r_{A}=0$ at and near Spine A. Therefore, even if PRP-encoding mRNAs are captured at A (so $C_{A}(t)>0$ within the time window), they cannot be translated locally into proteins needed to convert the transient potentiation into late, protein synthesis-dependent L-LTP.\n\n4) As tagging is intact, Spine A can still exhibit an early-phase potentiation (E-LTP) induced by the initial weak stimulation. Let the synaptic strength at A be $S_{A}(t)$. E-LTP is transient and decays on a timescale $\\tau_{\\text{E}}$ in the absence of the protein synthesis-dependent processes required for stabilization. With $r_{A}=0$, the condition for consolidation to L-LTP at A is not satisfied, so $S_{A}(t)$ returns to baseline for $t \\gg \\tau_{\\text{E}}$ (that is, several hours later).\n\n5) Potential alternatives are ruled out as follows:\n- The tag formation does not require protein synthesis, so the premise of option A is false.\n- Capturing PRP-encoding mRNAs without the ability to translate them locally does not yield robust L-LTP, so option B is false.\n- Although some PRPs can be proteins synthesized in the soma, the canonical STC literature and local translation requirements for spine-specific consolidation indicate that local protein synthesis at the tagged synapse is necessary; blocking ribosomes locally prevents L-LTP at that input even with intact somatic synthesis, so option D is not supported.\n- There is no mechanism given for a retrograde signal from A to suppress global protein synthesis; B and soma are unaffected, so option E is false.\n\nTherefore, the most likely fate of Spine A is an initial, transient potentiation that decays back to baseline, failing to consolidate into L-LTP.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for three derivations based on the provided model.\n\n**1. Time Course $T(t)$ and Half-Life $t_{1/2}$**\n\nThe decay of the synaptic tag concentration $T(t)$ is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -k_T T\n$$\nThis equation has the initial condition $T(0) = T_0$. We can solve this separable differential equation by integration:\n$$\n\\int_{T_0}^{T(t)} \\frac{dT'}{T'} = \\int_0^t -k_T dt'\n$$\nwhere $T'$ and $t'$ are the integration variables. Performing the integration on both sides yields:\n$$\n[\\ln(T')]_{T_0}^{T(t)} = [-k_T t']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(T(t)) - \\ln(T_0) = -k_T t\n$$\nRearranging and exponentiating gives the explicit time course of the tag concentration:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{T(t)}{T_0}\\right) = -k_T t \\implies T(t) = T_0 \\exp(-k_T t)\n$$\nThe half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is the time required for the concentration to fall to one-half of its initial value, i.e., $T(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{T_0}{2}$. Substituting this condition into the time course equation:\n$$\n\\frac{T_0}{2} = T_0 \\exp(-k_T t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $T_0$ (which is non-zero) and taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_T t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we get:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k_T t_{1/2}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ gives the expression for the half-life in terms of the decay rate constant $k_T$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_T}\n$$\n\n**2. Capture Window $t_w$**\n\nThe capture window, $t_w$, is the time duration for which the tag concentration $T(t)$ remains above the capture threshold $T_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The window closes at time $t_w$ when $T(t_w) = T_{\\mathrm{th}}$. Given that $T_{\\mathrm{th}} = f T_0$ for some fraction $f$ such that $0  f  1$, we can set:\n$$\nT(t_w) = T_0 \\exp(-k_T t_w) = f T_0\n$$\nDividing by $T_0$ and taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\exp(-k_T t_w) = f\n$$\n$$\n-k_T t_w = \\ln(f)\n$$\nSolving for $t_w$ yields the expression for the capture window:\n$$\nt_w = -\\frac{\\ln(f)}{k_T} = \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{k_T}\n$$\n\n**3. Fold-Change $R$ Calculation**\n\nWe are given a baseline rate constant $k_T^{(0)} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$ and a threshold fraction $f = 0.15$. We need to compare the capture window $t_w$ under two conditions.\n\nThe first condition involves a kinase that reduces the decay rate to $k_T^{\\mathrm{kinase}} = 0.60\\,k_T^{(0)}$. The capture window under this condition is:\n$$\nt_w^{\\mathrm{kinase}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{k_T^{\\mathrm{kinase}}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{0.60\\,k_T^{(0)}}\n$$\n\nThe second condition involves a phosphatase that increases the decay rate to $k_T^{\\mathrm{phosphatase}} = 1.25\\,k_T^{(0)}$. The capture window is:\n$$\nt_w^{\\mathrm{phosphatase}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{k_T^{\\mathrm{phosphatase}}} = \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{1.25\\,k_T^{(0)}}\n$$\n\nThe fold-change $R$ is defined as the ratio of these two capture windows:\n$$\nR = \\frac{t_w^{\\mathrm{kinase}}}{t_w^{\\mathrm{phosphatase}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the capture windows:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{0.60\\,k_T^{(0)}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{\\ln(1/f)}{1.25\\,k_T^{(0)}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe terms $\\ln(1/f)$ and $k_T^{(0)}$ are common to both the numerator and denominator and can be cancelled. This shows that the fold-change $R$ is independent of the specific values of $f$ and $k_T^{(0)}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{1}{0.60}}{\\frac{1}{1.25}} = \\frac{1.25}{0.60}\n$$\nWe now perform the numerical calculation:\n$$\nR = \\frac{1.25}{0.60} = \\frac{125}{60} = \\frac{25}{12} \\approx 2.08333...\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 2.083\n$$\nThis result indicates that the kinase-mediated stabilization of the synaptic tag extends the capture window by a factor of approximately $2.083$ compared to the phosphatase-mediated destabilization.",
