            "solution": "The problem asks for two things: first, to derive the expression for the potassium equilibrium potential, and second, to calculate the change in this potential given a change in extracellular potassium concentration.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Potassium Equilibrium Potential\n\nThe foundation for this derivation is the concept of electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ionic species $j$. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_j + z_j F \\psi\n$$\nIn this equation, $\\mu_j^{\\circ}$ represents the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin, $a_j$ is the chemical activity of the ion, $z_j$ is its valence (charge number), $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential of the compartment (e.g., intracellular or extracellular space).\n\nFor an ion to be in equilibrium across a permeable membrane, there must be no net flux. This condition is satisfied when the electrochemical potential of the ion is identical in the intracellular and extracellular compartments. For the potassium ion, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, we set its intracellular electrochemical potential equal to its extracellular electrochemical potential:\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}, \\mathrm{in}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}, \\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of electrochemical potential for the intracellular (in) and extracellular (out) compartments:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} + z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\\circ} + RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} + z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}\n$$\nThe standard chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{\\circ}$, depends on the nature of the ion and the solvent but not its location, so it is the same on both sides of the equation and can be canceled. After cancellation, we rearrange the terms to isolate the electrical potential difference, $\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}$, which is by definition the membrane potential, $V_m$:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}} = RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} - RT \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F (\\psi_{\\mathrm{in}} - \\psi_{\\mathrm{out}}) = RT \\left( \\ln a_{\\mathrm{out}} - \\ln a_{\\mathrm{in}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithmic property $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$:\n$$\nz_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} F V_m = RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{out}}}{a_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe membrane potential at which this equilibrium for a specific ion is achieved is called the equilibrium potential for that ion, denoted $E_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.

We need to calculate the change in this potential, $\\Delta V_m$, as the extracellular potassium concentration, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out}}$, changes.\n\nLet the initial and final membrane potentials be $V_{m, \\text{initial}}$ and $V_{m, \\text{final}}$, corresponding to the initial and final extracellular potassium concentrations, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}}$ and $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}}$, respectively.\n$$\nV_{m, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nV_{m, \\text{final}} = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe signed change in membrane potential is $\\Delta V_m = V_{m, \\text{final}} - V_{m, \\text{initial}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) - \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the term $\\frac{RT}{zF}$ and applying the logarithmic subtraction rule again:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\left[ \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) - \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}} / [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}} / [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe intracellular concentration $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{in}}$ cancels, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{RT}{zF} \\ln \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}}} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided values into this final expression:\n$R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$z = +1$\n$F = 96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, initial}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n$[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{out, final}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{mM}$\n\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(310\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(1)(96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})} \\ln \\left( \\frac{6\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{3\\,\\mathrm{mM}} \\right)\n$$\nThe units of concentration cancel, and the resulting unit is Joules per Coulomb, which is Volts ($V$).\n$$\n\\Delta V_m = \\frac{2577.34}{96485} \\,\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_m \\approx (0.0267123\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\cdot (0.693147)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta V_m \\approx 0.0185168\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$).

While upstream arterioles may dilate to increase overall flow to a region, pericytes—cells that wrap around individual capillaries—can create localized constrictions, leading to a maldistribution of blood.

During a localized neural activation, upstream smooth muscle dilation increases the driving pressure drop across the capillary bed from $\\Delta P$ to $2\\Delta P$ (net arteriolar dilation). Simultaneously, a pericyte on capillary $1$ constricts its lumen radius to $\\alpha r$ with $\\alpha = 0.7$, while capillary $2$ remains at radius $r$. Assume laminar flow, an incompressible Newtonian plasma, and that red blood cell (RBC) flux partitions proportionally to volumetric flow in each capillary. Arterial oxygen content $C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$ is constant, capillary wall permeability per unit area is uniform, and tissue oxygen consumption demand remains fixed over the time scale considered.\n\nWhich option best predicts and explains how pericyte-mediated constrictions at select capillaries could paradoxically impair tissue oxygenation even during net arteriolar dilation?\n\nA. Local increases in capillary resistance from the pericyte constriction create a maldistribution of RBC flux (capillary transit time heterogeneity), so flow is shunted into faster channels with shorter RBC transit times. Because oxygen extraction efficiency declines as transit times shorten and surface area is not proportionally increased, the whole-bed oxygen extraction fraction can fall, impairing tissue oxygenation despite the higher upstream driving pressure.\n\nB. Net arteriolar dilation necessarily increases oxygen delivery $Q \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$ enough to raise tissue oxygen partial pressure regardless of downstream microvascular heterogeneity, so tissue oxygenation must improve.\n\nC. The pericyte constriction slows blood in the affected capillary, increasing its diffusion time and thus end-capillary oxygen tension, which improves overall tissue oxygenation during arteriolar dilation.\n\nD.

Flow in the unconstricted capillary doubles.\n        *   This demonstrates a significant **maldistribution of flow**. The majority of the blood flow is shunted through capillary 2, the path of lower resistance.\n        *   Total flow: $Q_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{final}} = Q_1^{\\text{final}} + Q_2^{\\text{final}} = (2\\alpha^4 + 2)\\frac{\\Delta P}{R_0} = (1+\\alpha^4) \\frac{2\\Delta P}{R_0} = (1+\\alpha^4)Q_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{initial}}$.\n        *   $Q_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{final}} = (1+0.2401)Q_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{initial}} \\approx 1.24 Q_{\\text{total}}^{\\text{initial}}$. The total blood flow increases by about $24\\%$.\n\n    *   **Implications for Oxygen Extraction**:\n        *   The efficiency of oxygen extraction from blood depends critically on the **transit time** ($T$) of red blood cells (RBCs) in the capillary. Transit time is the capillary volume ($V_{\\text{cap}}$) divided by the volumetric flow rate ($Q$):\n            $$ T = \\frac{V_{\\text{cap}}}{Q} = \\frac{\\pi r^2 L}{Q} $$\n        *   A longer transit time allows for more complete diffusion of oxygen from RBCs to the tissue. The oxygen extraction fraction, $E_{O_2}$, is a monotonically increasing function of transit time, often modeled by the Renkin-Crone equation: $E_{O_2} = 1 - \\exp(-PS/Q)$, where $PS$ is the permeability-surface area product. Since $PS/Q$ is proportional to transit time, we can write $E_{O_2} = 1 - \\exp(-kT)$ for some constant $k$.\n        *   Let's analyze the transit times:\n            *   Baseline: $T_1^{\\text{initial}} = T_2^{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2 L}{Q_1^{\\text{initial}}}$. Let this be $T_0$.\n            *   Final State Capillary 1: $T_1^{\\text{final}} = \\frac{\\pi (\\alpha r)^2 L}{Q_1^{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{\\alpha^2 \\pi r^2 L}{2\\alpha^4 Q_1^{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^2} \\frac{\\pi r^2 L}{Q_1^{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1}{2(0.7)^2} T_0 = \\frac{1}{0.98} T_0 \\approx 1.02 T_0$. The transit time in the constricted capillary is nearly unchanged (slightly longer).\n            *   Final State Capillary 2: $T_2^{\\text{final}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2 L}{Q_2^{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{\\pi r^2 L}{2 Q_2^{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1}{2} T_0$. The transit time in the unconstricted, high-flow capillary is *halved*.\n        *   The system now exhibits significant **transit time heterogeneity**.\n        *   The majority of the blood flow (and thus RBCs, as per the problem statement) is shunted into capillary 2, which has a very short transit time. The halving of transit time leads to a significant reduction in oxygen extraction efficiency, $E_{O_2}$, in that capillary. A large fraction of the oxygen delivered through this channel will remain in the blood and exit into the venule, having been \"wasted\" from the perspective of the tissue.\n        *   Meanwhile, capillary 1 is \"starved\" of flow. Although its transit time is long, allowing for efficient extraction, the total amount of oxygen delivered to it ($Q_1^{\\text{final}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$) is severely reduced.\n        *   The net effect is that even though total blood flow has increased by $24\\%$, the total amount of oxygen extracted by the tissue ($(\\sum E_{O_2,i} Q_i) C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$) can decrease. The inefficiency of extraction in the high-flow \"shunt\" pathway can overwhelm the modest increase in total flow, leading to a net deficit in oxygen supply to the tissue. This impairment of oxygenation, despite increased total flow, is the central paradox.\n\n3.  **Option-by-Option Analysis**:\n    *   **A. Local increases in capillary resistance from the pericyte constriction create a maldistribution of RBC flux (capillary transit time heterogeneity), so flow is shunted into faster channels with shorter RBC transit times. Because oxygen extraction efficiency declines as transit times shorten and surface area is not proportionally increased, the whole-bed oxygen extraction fraction can fall, impairing tissue oxygenation despite the higher upstream driving pressure.**\n        *   This option accurately describes the entire chain of events derived above. The pericyte constriction increases resistance in one capillary, causing a maldistribution of flow (shunting). This creates heterogeneity in transit times, with the shunted channel becoming a fast pathway. It correctly identifies that oxygen extraction efficiency is a function of transit time and that shorter times lead to lower efficiency. The conclusion that this can impair overall tissue oxygenation despite an increase in total flow is the correct resolution to the paradox.\n        *   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n    *   **B. Net arteriolar dilation necessarily increases oxygen delivery $Q \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$ enough to raise tissue oxygen partial pressure regardless of downstream microvascular heterogeneity, so tissue oxygenation must improve.**\n        *   This option incorrectly equates increased total oxygen delivery ($Q_{\\text{total}} \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{a}O_2}$) with improved tissue oxygenation. Tissue oxygenation depends on oxygen *extraction*, which is a function of flow distribution and transit times. The phrase \"regardless of downstream microvascular heterogeneity\" is a fatal flaw, as this heterogeneity is the very mechanism that can uncouple total flow from tissue oxygenation.\n        *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n    *   **C. The pericyte constriction slows blood in the affected capillary, increasing its diffusion time and thus end-capillary oxygen tension, which improves overall tissue oxygenation during arteriolar dilation.**\n        *   This option contains multiple errors. While the constriction does increase transit time in the affected capillary (from $T_0$ to $\\approx 1.02 T_0$), this leads to *more* oxygen extraction, which would *lower* the end-capillary oxygen tension, not increase it. More importantly, it completely ignores the drastic reduction in flow to this capillary and the shunting effect in the parallel capillary, which are the dominant factors determining overall tissue oxygenation. The improvement in extraction efficiency in the starved capillary cannot compensate for the huge loss of efficiency in the flooded one.\n        *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n    *   **D. Pericyte constrictions only influence venous outflow and do not affect oxygen extraction, so tissue oxygenation will be unchanged.**\n        *   This statement is factually incorrect. Pericyte constrictions are a primary local control mechanism for capillary resistance and flow, which directly determines the conditions for oxygen exchange (e.g., transit time, surface area to perfusion ratio). To claim they do not affect oxygen extraction is a direct contradiction of fundamental physiological principles.\n        *   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
