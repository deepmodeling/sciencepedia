It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by first calculating the baseline degradation rate constants for the two pathways, then determining how these constants change under proteotoxic stress, and finally calculating the new half-life and its change from baseline.\n\nLet $k_{\\text{total},0}$ be the total degradation rate constant at baseline. According to the given formula for half-life, this is related to the baseline half-life $t_{1/2,0}$ as:\n$$k_{\\text{total},0} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,0}}$$\nGiven $t_{1/2,0} = 10$ days, the baseline total rate constant is:\n$$k_{\\text{total},0} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{10} \\text{ days}^{-1}$$\nThe total rate constant is the sum of the rate constants for the Ubiquitin-Proteasome System (UPS) and autophagy (A):\n$$k_{\\text{total},0} = k_{\\text{UPS},0} + k_{\\text{A},0}$$\nThe problem states that at baseline, the UPS accounts for a fraction $f = 0.70$ of the total degradation flux. Since the degradation rate for each pathway is proportional to its rate constant (i.e., $v_i = k_i [P]$), the fraction of flux is equal to the fraction of the total rate constant.\nThus, the baseline rate constant for the UPS is:\n$$k_{\\text{UPS},0} = f \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0} = 0.70 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}$$\nThe remaining fraction is due to autophagy, so the baseline rate constant for autophagy is:\n$$k_{\\text{A},0} = (1 - f) \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0} = (1 - 0.70) \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0} = 0.30 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}$$\n\nNext, we consider the state under proteotoxic stress. Let the new rate constants be denoted with a subscript $1$.\nThe problem states that autophagic flux remains unchanged, which implies its effective rate constant is also unchanged:\n$$k_{\\text{A},1} = k_{\\text{A},0} = 0.30 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}$$\nFor the UPS pathway, the effective rate constant is $k_{\\text{UPS}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max,\\text{UPS}}}{K_{m,\\text{UPS}}}$. The problem states that $V_{\\max,\\text{UPS}}$ declines by a fraction $0.30$, while $K_{m,\\text{UPS}}$ is unchanged. The new maximum rate is:\n$$V_{\\max,\\text{UPS},1} = (1 - 0.30) \\cdot V_{\\max,\\text{UPS},0} = 0.70 \\cdot V_{\\max,\\text{UPS},0}$$\nTherefore, the new UPS rate constant, $k_{\\text{UPS},1}$, is:\n$$k_{\\text{UPS},1} = \\dfrac{V_{\\max,\\text{UPS},1}}{K_{m,\\text{UPS}}} = \\dfrac{0.70 \\cdot V_{\\max,\\text{UPS},0}}{K_{m,\\text{UPS}}} = 0.70 \\cdot k_{\\text{UPS},0}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{UPS},0}$ in terms of $k_{\\text{total},0}$:\n$$k_{\\text{UPS},1} = 0.70 \\cdot (0.70 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}) = 0.49 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}$$\n\nThe new total degradation rate constant, $k_{\\text{total},1}$, is the sum of the new component rate constants:\n$$k_{\\text{total},1} = k_{\\text{UPS},1} + k_{\\text{A},1}$$\n$$k_{\\text{total},1} = (0.49 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}) + (0.30 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}) = (0.49 + 0.30) \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0} = 0.79 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}$$\nThe new half-life, $t_{1/2,1}$, is given by:\n$$t_{1/2,1} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{total},1}} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{0.79 \\cdot k_{\\text{total},0}}$$\nSince $t_{1/2,0} = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{total},0}}$, we can write the new half-life in terms of the baseline half-life:\n$$t_{1/2,1} = \\dfrac{1}{0.79} \\cdot \\left(\\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{total},0}}\\right) = \\dfrac{t_{1/2,0}}{0.79}$$\nSubstituting the given value $t_{1/2,0} = 10$ days:\n$$t_{1/2,1} = \\dfrac{10}{0.79} \\text{ days}$$\nThe problem asks for the change in half-life, $\\Delta t_{1/2}$, defined as $t_{1/2,1} - t_{1/2,0}$.\n$$\\Delta t_{1/2} = t_{1/2,1} - t_{1/2,0} = \\dfrac{10}{0.79} - 10$$\n$$\\Delta t_{1/2} = 10 \\left( \\dfrac{1}{0.79} - 1 \\right) = 10 \\left( \\dfrac{1 - 0.79}{0.79} \\right) = 10 \\left( \\dfrac{0.21}{0.79} \\right)$$\nNow, we perform the calculation:\n$$\\Delta t_{1/2} = \\dfrac{2.1}{0.79} \\approx 2.6582278...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe fifth significant figure is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\\Delta t_{1/2} \\approx 2.658 \\text{ days}$$",

The problem is feasible.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed. The objective is clearly stated, and the provided information is sufficient to find a unique solution for $s^{\\star}$.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires a multi-step derivation and calculation, involving calculus and the application of queueing theory principles. It is not trivial or tautological.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The model's predictions are, in principle, verifiable against more complex simulations or experimental data on protein turnover rates under stress.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem describes a queueing system with Poisson arrivals at rate $\\lambda(s)$ and a single server with exponential service times at rate $\\mu$. This is a classic M/M/1 queue. The quantity of interest, $L(s)$, is the average number of \"customers\" (misfolded proteins) in the system at steady state.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $L(s)$. The problem states we can use Little's law, which relates the average number of customers in a system, $L$, to the arrival rate, $\\lambda$, and the average time a customer spends in the system, $W$. The law is stated as $L = \\lambda W$.\n\nFor an M/M/1 queue, the average time a customer spends in the system, $W$ (which includes waiting time and service time), is a standard result given by:\n$$W(s) = \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda(s)}$$\nThis formula is valid under the steady-state condition $\\lambda(s) < \\mu$, which ensures the denominator is positive.\n\nApplying Little's Law, we find the average number of proteins in the system, $L(s)$:\n$$L(s) = \\lambda(s) W(s) = \\lambda(s) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda(s)} \\right) = \\frac{\\lambda(s)}{\\mu - \\lambda(s)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given expression for the arrival rate, $\\lambda(s) = \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)$:\n$$L(s) = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)}$$\nThis is the expression for the steady-state pool of misfolded proteins as a function of stress, $s$.\n\nNext, we need to find the marginal sensitivity of this pool to stress, $\\frac{dL}{ds}$. We differentiate $L(s)$ with respect to $s$ using the quotient rule, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right) = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$.\nLet $u(s) = \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)$ and $v(s) = \\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)$.\nThe derivatives with respect to $s$ are:\n$$\\frac{du}{ds} = \\lambda_{0}\\beta$$\n$$\\frac{dv}{ds} = -\\lambda_{0}\\beta$$\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\frac{(\\lambda_{0}\\beta)[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)] - [\\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)](-\\lambda_{0}\\beta)}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)]^2}$$\n$$\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu - \\lambda_{0}^2\\beta(1 + \\beta s) + \\lambda_{0}^2\\beta(1 + \\beta s)}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)]^2}$$\nThe two terms in the numerator cancel, leaving:\n$$\\frac{dL}{ds} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s)]^2}$$\n\nThe problem defines the onset of a \"non-linear surge\" at a stress level $s^{\\star}$ satisfying the condition:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dL}{ds}\\right|_{s = s^{\\star}} = \\gamma \\left.\\frac{dL}{ds}\\right|_{s = 0}$$\nWe evaluate the derivative at $s = s^{\\star}$ and $s = 0$.\nAt $s = s^{\\star}$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{dL}{ds}\\right|_{s = s^{\\star}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star})]^2}$$\nAt $s = 0$ (baseline):\n$$\\left.\\frac{dL}{ds}\\right|_{s = 0} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + 0)]^2} = \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{(\\mu - \\lambda_{0})^2}$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the condition for $s^{\\star}$:\n$$\\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star})]^2} = \\gamma \\frac{\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu}{(\\mu - \\lambda_{0})^2}$$\nSince $\\lambda_0$, $\\beta$, and $\\mu$ are all positive, the term $\\lambda_{0}\\beta\\mu$ is non-zero and can be canceled from both sides:\n$$\\frac{1}{[\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star})]^2} = \\frac{\\gamma}{(\\mu - \\lambda_{0})^2}$$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$(\\mu - \\lambda_{0})^2 = \\gamma [\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star})]^2$$\nWe take the square root of both sides. The steady-state condition $\\lambda(s) < \\mu$ implies that both bases, $(\\mu - \\lambda_{0})$ and $(\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star}))$, are positive. Therefore, we can take the positive root without ambiguity:\n$$\\mu - \\lambda_{0} = \\sqrt{\\gamma} [\\mu - \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star})]$$\nNow, we solve for $s^{\\star}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}} = \\mu - \\lambda_{0} - \\lambda_{0}\\beta s^{\\star}$$\n$$\\lambda_{0}\\beta s^{\\star} = (\\mu - \\lambda_{0}) - \\frac{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}$$\n$$\\lambda_{0}\\beta s^{\\star} = (\\mu - \\lambda_{0})\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}\\right)$$\n$$s^{\\star} = \\frac{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}{\\lambda_{0}\\beta}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}}\\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for $s^{\\star}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\lambda_{0} = 1.0$, $\\beta = 0.5$, $\\mu = 1.5$, and $\\gamma = 9$.\n$$s^{\\star} = \\frac{1.5 - 1.0}{1.0 \\times 0.5}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{9}}\\right)$$\n$$s^{\\star} = \\frac{0.5}{0.5}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right)$$\n$$s^{\\star} = 1 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)$$\n$$s^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$s^{\\star} \\approx 0.666666...$$\n$$s^{\\star} \\approx 0.6667$$\n\nWe must verify that the steady-state condition $\\lambda(s^{\\star}) < \\mu$ is satisfied.\n$$\\lambda(s^{\\star}) = \\lambda_{0}(1 + \\beta s^{\\star}) = 1.0\\left(1 + 0.5 \\times \\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nThe value of $\\mu$ is $1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$. The condition is $\\frac{4}{3} < \\frac{3}{2}$, which is equivalent to $8 < 9$. The condition holds.\nThe final answer is $s^{\\star}$ rounded to four significant figures.",
