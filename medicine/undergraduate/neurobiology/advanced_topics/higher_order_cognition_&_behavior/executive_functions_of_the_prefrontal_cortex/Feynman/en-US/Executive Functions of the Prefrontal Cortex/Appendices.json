This exercise explores the critical role of the neuromodulator dopamine, whose relationship with executive performance is famously described by an inverted-U curve. By modeling dopamine kinetics, you will quantitatively link variations in the Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene to the brain's dopamine levels and, in turn, predict how these genetic differences impact cognitive performance . This practice provides a powerful example of how we can connect phenomena across biological scales, from genes to behavior.",

            "problem": "Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) modulates extracellular dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Across COMT genotypes, enzyme activity changes cortical dopamine clearance, thereby shifting the steady-state dopamine level. Executive performance supported by the PFC is widely observed to follow an inverted-U dependence on dopamine, which can be locally captured by a concave quadratic approximation of a smooth performance-versus-dopamine curve. Consider the following biophysically grounded model composed of two parts.\n\nPart 1 (dopamine kinetics): Assume extracellular dopamine concentration in cortex, denoted by $D(t)$, follows first-order mass-action kinetics\n$$\\frac{dD}{dt} = S - k D,$$\nwhere $S$ is the effective dopamine input rate (release plus synthesis into the extracellular space) with units $\\text{nM}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}$, and $k$ is the first-order clearance rate constant with units $\\text{min}^{-1}$ that aggregates uptake, diffusion, and enzymatic degradation. Let $k$ be decomposed as $k = k_{\\text{base}} + k_{\\text{COMT}}$, where $k_{\\text{base}}$ captures non-COMT processes (e.g., the dopamine transporter (DAT) and diffusion) and $k_{\\text{COMT}}$ captures genotype-dependent COMT activity.\n\nPart 2 (executive performance): Let the executive performance index be modeled as\n$$P(D) = P_{\\max} - c\\,(D - D_{\\text{opt}})^{2},$$\nwhere $P_{\\max}$ is the maximal achievable performance index (unitless), $c$ is a curvature parameter (units $\\text{index}\\cdot\\text{nM}^{-2}$), and $D_{\\text{opt}}$ is the dopamine concentration that maximizes performance.\n\nUse the following parameter values grounded in empirical ranges:\n- $S = 0.50\\ \\text{nM}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\text{base}} = 0.08\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$,\n- $k_{\\text{COMT}}^{\\text{Val/Val}} = 0.12\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{COMT}}^{\\text{Val/Met}} = 0.08\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{COMT}}^{\\text{Met/Met}} = 0.04\\ \\text{min}^{-1}$,\n- $P_{\\max} = 100$ (unitless),\n- $c = 8\\ \\text{nM}^{-2}$ (index units per $\\text{nM}^{2}$),\n- $D_{\\text{opt}} = 3.5\\ \\text{nM}$.\n\nStarting from the kinetic equation and the performance mapping above, determine the predicted change in the executive performance index between the Met/Met genotype and the Val/Val genotype, defined as $P(D^{*}_{\\text{Met/Met}}) - P(D^{*}_{\\text{Val/Val}})$, where $D^{*}$ denotes the steady-state dopamine concentration.

            "problem": "A canonical neurobiological account of response inhibition in the stop-signal task posits an independent race between a fast \"go\" process and a slower \"stop\" process supported by prefrontal cortex circuits, including the right inferior frontal gyrus and the pre-supplementary motor area. In the independent race model, a response is produced if and only if the go process finishes before the stop process completes. The stop process is initiated at a stop-signal delay (SSD) after the go stimulus. Let the \"go\" finishing times be represented by the empirical distribution of go reaction times (RTs) from no-stop trials, and let the stop process have a characteristic latency, the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT).\n\nStarting from the following foundational definitions and facts:\n- The race model assumes stochastic independence between the go finishing time and the stop finishing time.\n- A response on a stop trial occurs if the go finishing time is less than the stop finishing time. Under the assumption that the stop finishing time equals $\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$, the probability of responding given a stop signal equals the probability that the go finishing time is less than $\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$.\n- The empirical cumulative distribution function of go RTs, denoted $F_{\\mathrm{go}}(t)$, gives the probability that the go finishing time is less than or equal to $t$.\n\nUse these principles to derive the integration-based estimator of the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT), and then compute it for the dataset below. You must treat the empirical go RTs as the go finishing times and use the overall probability of responding on stop trials. For the empirical quantile, use the discrete integration rule that selects the $\\lceil p \\cdot N \\rceil$th smallest go RT, where $p$ is the probability of responding on stop trials and $N$ is the number of go RTs.\n\nData:\n- No-stop (go) RTs in milliseconds (ms) across $N = 30$ trials:\n$\\{520, 480, 610, 455, 590, 540, 500, 470, 630, 560, 445, 575, 600, 485, 530, 615, 490, 465, 580, 510, 435, 605, 570, 495, 550, 475, 625, 440, 465, 515\\}$.\n- Stop trials: $120$ trials in total, with $70$ successful inhibitions.\n- Stop-signal delays (SSD) used across stop trials with frequencies:\n$200$ ms used on $30$ trials, $250$ ms used on $60$ trials, and $300$ ms used on $30$ trials.\n\nCompute the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) using the integration method derived from the race model assumptions above.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the integration-based estimator for the Stop-Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) from the principles of the independent race model, followed by its computation using the provided dataset.\n\nFirst, the derivation of the estimator will be established. The independent race model posits that on a stop-signal trial, a \"go\" process, initiated by a go stimulus, races against a \"stop\" process, initiated by a stop signal. A motor response is executed if and only if the go process finishes before the stop process.\n\nLet $T_{go}$ be the random variable representing the finishing time of the go process. The distribution of $T_{go}$ is given by the empirical distribution of reaction times (RTs) from no-stop (go-only) trials.\nLet $T_{stop}$ be the random variable representing the finishing time of the stop process.\nThe stop signal is presented at a Stop-Signal Delay (SSD) after the go stimulus. The stop process itself has a latency, the SSRT. A core assumption of the model for estimation purposes is that the finishing time of the stop process is the sum of the SSD and the SSRT.\n$$T_{stop} = \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$$\nThis formulation often treats SSRT as a constant parameter to be estimated, rather than a random variable.\n\nA response is made if $T_{go} < T_{stop}$. Substituting the expression for $T_{stop}$, this condition becomes:\n$$T_{go} < \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$$\nThe probability of this event occurring on a stop trial with a given SSD, which is the probability of responding, is:\n$$p(\\text{respond} | \\mathrm{SSD}) = P(T_{go} < \\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nThis probability can be expressed using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the go finishing times, $F_{go}(t) = P(T_{go} \\le t)$. Assuming a continuous distribution for $T_{go}$ (or for a discrete distribution where the inequality is treated as non-strict, as is common), we have:\n$$p(\\text{respond} | \\mathrm{SSD}) = F_{go}(\\mathrm{SSD} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nThe \"integration method\" for estimating SSRT over a block of trials with varying SSDs uses the overall probability of responding, $p(\\text{respond})$, and the mean stop-signal delay, $\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$. The model equation is thus approximated as:\n$$p(\\text{respond}) \\approx F_{go}(\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}} + \\mathrm{SSRT})$$\nTo solve for SSRT, we must isolate it. This is achieved by inverting the CDF, $F_{go}$, which gives the quantile function, $F_{go}^{-1}$. Applying the quantile function to the probability $p(\\text{respond})$ yields the value of $T_{go}$ at which the go process has finished in $p(\\text{respond})$ proportion of trials.\n$$F_{go}^{-1}(p(\\text{respond})) \\approx \\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}} + \\mathrm{SSRT}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the integration-based estimator for SSRT:\n$$\\mathrm{SSRT} \\approx F_{go}^{-1}(p(\\text{respond})) - \\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$$\nThis completes the derivation. Now, we compute the SSRT using the provided data.\n\nThe computation proceeds in four steps:\n1.  Calculate the overall probability of responding, $p(\\text{respond})$.\n2.  Calculate the mean stop-signal delay, $\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$.\n3.  Determine the go RT quantile, $F_{go}^{-1}(p(\\text{respond}))$.\n4.  Calculate the SSRT using the derived formula.\n\nStep 1: Calculate $p(\\text{respond})$.\nThe total number of stop trials is $N_{stop} = 120$.\nThe number of successful inhibitions is $N_{inhibited} = 70$.\nThe number of trials where a response was made (failed inhibitions) is $N_{response} = N_{stop} - N_{inhibited} = 120 - 70 = 50$.\nThe overall probability of responding is the ratio of response trials to total stop trials:\n$$p(\\text{respond}) = \\frac{N_{response}}{N_{stop}} = \\frac{50}{120} = \\frac{5}{12}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate $\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$.\nThe SSDs and their respective frequencies are given: $200$ ms for $30$ trials, $250$ ms for $60$ trials, and $300$ ms for $30$ trials. The total number of stop trials is $30+60+30=120$.\nThe mean SSD is the weighted average:\n$$\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}} = \\frac{(200 \\times 30) + (250 \\times 60) + (300 \\times 30)}{30 + 60 + 30} \\text{ ms}$$\n$$\\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}} = \\frac{6000 + 15000 + 9000}{120} \\text{ ms} = \\frac{30000}{120} \\text{ ms} = 250 \\text{ ms}$$\n\nStep 3: Determine the go RT quantile.\nThe problem specifies using the empirical distribution of the $N = 30$ go RTs. The required quantile corresponds to $p = p(\\text{respond}) = 5/12$. The rule for finding the quantile is to take the $\\lceil p \\cdot N \\rceil$-th smallest go RT.\nWe calculate the index $k$:\n$$k = \\left\\lceil p \\cdot N \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{5}{12} \\cdot 30 \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 12.5 \\rceil = 13$$\nWe must find the $13$-th value in the sorted list of go RTs. The provided go RTs are:\n$\\{520, 480, 610, 455, 590, 540, 500, 470, 630, 560, 445, 575, 600, 485, 530, 615, 490, 465, 580, 510, 435, 605, 570, 495, 550, 475, 625, 440, 465, 515\\}$.\nSorting these values in ascending order:\n$435, 440, 445, 455, 465, 465, 470, 475, 480, 485, 490, 495, \\mathbf{500}, 510, 515, 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, 570, 575, 580, 590, 600, 605, 610, 615, 625, 630$.\nThe $13$-th value in this ordered list is $500$.\nTherefore, the go RT quantile is $F_{go}^{-1}(5/12) = 500$ ms.\n\nStep 4: Calculate SSRT.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\\mathrm{SSRT} = F_{go}^{-1}(p(\\text{respond})) - \\overline{\\mathrm{SSD}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\mathrm{SSRT} = 500 \\text{ ms} - 250 \\text{ ms} = 250 \\text{ ms}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Derivation of the one-step prediction error ($\\delta_t$)**\n\nThe derivation is based on the principle of temporal consistency articulated in the Bellman equation.\n\n- The value of a state, $V(s_t)$, is the expected sum of all future discounted rewards starting from that state. This can be written recursively:\n  $$V(s_t) = \\mathbb{E}[r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})]$$\n  This equation states that the value of being in state $s_t$ is the expected immediate reward $r_t$ plus the discounted value of the next state $s_{t+1}$. This is the ideal value prediction.\n\n- At time $t$, the learner's current estimate of the value is $V(s_t)$. After taking an action, the learner observes the actual immediate reward $r_t$ and transitions to the next state $s_{t+1}$.\n\n- The learner can then form an updated, more accurate, single-sample estimate of what $V(s_t)$ should have been. This is the **Temporal Difference (TD) target**:\n  $$ \\text{TD Target} = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) $$\n  This target combines the actual reward received ($r_t$) with the estimated value of the resulting state ($V(s_{t+1})$).\n\n- The **prediction error**, $\\delta_t$, is the difference between this new target and the original prediction:\n  $$ \\delta_t = (\\text{TD Target}) - (\\text{Current Prediction}) = (r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1})) - V(s_t) $$\n\nThis formula precisely matches the one presented in option A.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Neurobiological Justification and Options**\n\n- **The Task Context:** The task involves *latent states*, meaning the animal cannot directly observe the current \"rule\" or \"context\". It must infer this state from a history of ambiguous cues and outcomes. This requires a \"cognitive map\" or an internal model of the task structure.\n\n- **The Role of the OFC:** A large body of research implicates the OFC in representing the value of states, especially when these states are abstract or must be inferred from context, as is the case here. The OFC is crucial for flexibly updating these value representations when the environment changes (e.g., when the latent state switches). It allows the animal to adapt its behavior based on an updated model of the world, rather than relying on slow, rigid stimulus-response habits.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n-   **A. $\\delta_t = r_t + \\gamma V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$; OFC represents an inferred belief-state $s_t$ and its value $V(s_t)$ when cues are ambiguous, enabling flexible revaluation under latent state switches.**\n    -   **Formula:** Correct, as derived above.\n    -   **Justification:** Correct. This aligns perfectly with the modern understanding of OFC function in model-based reinforcement learning and cognitive flexibility.\n    -   **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n-   **B. $\\delta_t = r_t + V(s_t) - \\gamma V(s_{t+1})$; OFC primarily gates motor output and is unnecessary for computing state values under ambiguity.**\n    -   **Formula:** Incorrect. The signs on the value terms are reversed.\n    -   **Justification:** Incorrect. The OFC is not primarily a motor gating structure, and it is considered essential, not unnecessary, for value computation under ambiguity.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **C. $\\delta_t = r_t - V(s_{t+1})$; striatal learning alone suffices for value updates, so OFC is dispensable when cues do not fully reveal the state.**\n    -   **Formula:** Incorrect. It is missing the discount factor $\\gamma$ and the current value term $V(s_t)$.\n    -   **Justification:** Incorrect. While the striatum is involved in value learning, tasks with latent states are thought to require the cognitive map representations provided by the OFC, making it indispensable.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **D. $\\delta_t = \\gamma r_t + V(s_{t+1}) - V(s_t)$; OFC encodes only action values $Q(s,a)$ in fully observable tasks and is not suited to represent values tied to latent inferences.**\n    -   **Formula:** Incorrect. The discount factor $\\gamma$ should apply to the future value, not the immediate reward.\n    -   **Justification:** Incorrect. The OFC is known to encode state and outcome values, and it is specifically implicated in tasks requiring latent state inference.\n    -   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n-   **E. $\\delta_t = r_t$; midbrain signals render cortical value representations superfluous, so OFC is not implicated in tasks requiring latent-state inference.**\n    -   **Formula:** Incorrect. This is just the reward signal, not a prediction error.\n    -   **Justification:** Incorrect. Midbrain dopamine signals are thought to *be* the prediction error signal that is used to *update* value representations in cortical areas like the OFC.
