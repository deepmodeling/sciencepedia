            "introduction": "One of the most fundamental ways neuromodulators regulate brain states is by directly altering the strength of communication at individual synapses. This exercise provides a quantitative look at how norepinephrine, a key modulator for arousal and attention, can potentiate an excitatory synapse by modifying the underlying ion channels. By tracing the signal from receptor binding through an intracellular signaling cascade to the biophysical properties of AMPA receptors, you will see precisely how a neuromodulator amplifies a synaptic current .",

            "problem": "Arousal-promoting firing of the Locus Coeruleus (LC) elevates extracellular norepinephrine (NE), which engages the beta-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) on pyramidal neurons. β-AR is a G protein-coupled receptor that activates the G subunit alpha s (G_s), increases cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and activates Protein Kinase A (PKA). PKA phosphorylates the Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor (particularly GluA1), thereby increasing synaptic efficacy during excitatory transmission. The excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) at its peak can be modeled from first principles as the product of synaptic conductance and driving force: $I = g_{\\text{syn}}\\,(V_{m} - E_{\\text{AMPA}})$, and the synaptic conductance at peak can be approximated by $g_{\\text{syn}} \\approx N\\,\\gamma\\,P_{\\text{open}}$ for $N$ identical receptors of single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ and peak open probability $P_{\\text{open}}$. β-AR occupancy by NE follows standard receptor-ligand binding with Hill coefficient $1$, with fractional occupancy $\\theta = \\frac{[{\\text{NE}}]}{K_{d} + [{\\text{NE}}]}$. Assume that the steady-state fraction of AMPA receptors phosphorylated by PKA is proportional to β-AR occupancy, $\\phi = \\eta\\,\\theta$, where $\\eta$ is an effective coupling efficiency encapsulating the cascade from β-AR through cAMP to PKA substrate phosphorylation.\n\nConsider a cortical excitatory synapse at a membrane potential $V_{m} = -65\\,\\text{mV}$, with an AMPA reversal potential $E_{\\text{AMPA}} = 0\\,\\text{mV}$. Baseline parameters are: $N = 80$, baseline single-channel conductance $\\gamma_{0} = 12\\,\\text{pS}$, and baseline peak open probability $P_{0} = 0.25$. An LC burst elevates $[{\\text{NE}}]$ to $300\\,\\text{nM}$; the β-AR dissociation constant is $K_{d} = 100\\,\\text{nM}$. The coupling efficiency is $\\eta = 0.80$. For each phosphorylated AMPA receptor, the single-channel conductance and peak open probability are multiplicatively scaled relative to baseline by $(1+\\alpha)$ and $(1+\\beta)$, respectively, with $\\alpha = 0.15$ and $\\beta = 0.20$. Unphosphorylated receptors remain at baseline values. Assume the driving force does not change between baseline and β-AR activation. Using only the foregoing fundamental relations and assumptions, derive how β-AR activation increases synaptic efficacy via PKA phosphorylation of AMPA receptors and calculate the predicted fold-change in peak EPSC magnitude under LC-evoked β-AR activation relative to baseline. Report the fold-change as a pure number (unitless). If your answer requires rounding, round to four significant figures.",

This quantity $Z$ represents the effective signal-to-noise control parameter, as it combines the strength of the signal (drift $\\mu$), the decision threshold (boundary $b$), and the level of noise (variance $\\sigma^2$). A larger $Z$ leads to a higher probability of choosing the correct alternative (associated with the positive drift), corresponding to an \"exploit\" strategy. A value of $Z$ near zero leads to a probability near $\\frac{1}{2}$, representing chance-level performance or an \"explore\" strategy.\n\nThe problem specifies the gain-dependent parameterizations: $\\mu(g) = g\\,\\mu_{0}$, $\\sigma(g) = g\\,\\sigma_{0}$, and $b(g) = b_{0}\\,g^{-q}$. We can substitute these into the expression for the control parameter $Z$ to determine its dependence on the gain $g$. Let's denote this gain-dependent control parameter as $Z(g)$.\n$$\nZ(g) = \\frac{\\mu(g) b(g)}{\\sigma(g)^2} = \\frac{(g\\,\\mu_{0})(b_{0}\\,g^{-q})}{(g\\,\\sigma_{0})^2} = \\frac{g^{1-q} \\mu_{0} b_{0}}{g^2 \\sigma_{0}^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} b_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^2}\\right) g^{1-q-2}\n$$\n$$\nZ(g) = \\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} b_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^2}\\right) g^{-(1+q)}\n$$\nLet's define the baseline control parameter as $Z_0 = \\frac{\\mu_{0} b_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^2}$. Then, $Z(g) = Z_0 \\, g^{-(1+q)}$. Since the problem states that $q > 0$, the exponent $-(1+q)$ is strictly negative. This implies that $Z(g)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $g$ for $g > 0$. As the LC-mediated gain $g$ increases, the effective signal-to-noise control parameter $Z(g)$ decreases towards zero. Consequently, the probability of hitting the upper boundary, $P_{\\text{up}}(g) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-2 Z(g))}$, approaches $\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(0)} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This shift from a high-probability, evidence-driven choice (exploitation) to a chance-level choice (exploration) is mediated by the reduction in the effective control parameter $Z(g)$ as gain $g$ increases.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires finding the smallest gain $g^{\\ast}$ that satisfies the exploration criterion $\\lvert P_{\\text{up}}(g) - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\rvert \\le \\delta$, where $\\delta = 0.05$.\nGiven that $\\mu_0 > 0$, the drift $\\mu(g)$ is positive, which means $Z(g)>0$ and thus $P_{\\text{up}}(g) > \\frac{1}{2}$. We can therefore remove the absolute value, and the criterion becomes:\n$$\nP_{\\text{up}}(g) - \\frac{1}{2} \\le \\delta \\implies P_{\\text{up}}(g) \\le \\frac{1}{2} + \\delta\n$$\nSince $P_{\\text{up}}(g)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $g$ (because $Z(g)$ is decreasing in $g$ and $P_{\\text{up}}(Z)$ is increasing in $Z$), the inequality will be satisfied for all $g$ greater than or equal to a certain critical value. The smallest such gain, $g^{\\ast}$, is found by solving the equality:\n$$\nP_{\\text{up}}(g^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\delta\n$$\nSubstituting the formula for $P_{\\text{up}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-2 Z(g^{\\ast}))} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\delta\n$$\nWe solve for $Z(g^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n1 + \\exp(-2 Z(g^{\\ast})) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-2 Z(g^{\\ast})) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta)}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-2 Z(g^{\\ast}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nZ(g^{\\ast}) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} + \\delta}{\\frac{1}{2} - \\delta}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2\\delta}{1-2\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute $Z(g^{\\ast}) = Z_0 (g^{\\ast})^{-(1+q)}$:\n$$\nZ_0 (g^{\\ast})^{-(1+q)} = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2\\delta}{1-2\\delta}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for $g^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n(g^{\\ast})^{1+q} = \\frac{2 Z_0}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2\\delta}{1-2\\delta}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\ng^{\\ast} = \\left[ \\frac{2 Z_0}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1+2\\delta}{1-2\\delta}\\right)} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{1+q}}\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values: $\\mu_{0} = 0.2$, $\\sigma_{0}^{2} = 0.5$, $b_{0} = 1.0$, $q = 1$, and $\\delta = 0.05$.\nFirst, calculate the baseline control parameter $Z_0$:\n$$\nZ_0 = \\frac{\\mu_{0} b_{0}}{\\sigma_{0}^2} = \\frac{0.2 \\times 1.0}{0.5} = 0.4\n$$\nNext, calculate the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{1+2\\delta}{1-2\\delta} = \\frac{1+2(0.05)}{1-2(0.05)} = \\frac{1.1}{0.9} = \\frac{11}{9}\n$$\nThe exponent is $\\frac{1}{1+q} = \\frac{1}{1+1} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $g^{\\ast}$:\n$$\ng^{\\ast} = \\left[ \\frac{2 \\times 0.4}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right)} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\left[ \\frac{0.8}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right)} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right) \\approx 0.2006707\n$$\n$$\ng^{\\ast} \\approx \\left[ \\frac{0.8}{0.2006707} \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx \\left[ 3.98663 \\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 1.996655\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $g^{\\ast} \\approx 2.00$.",
