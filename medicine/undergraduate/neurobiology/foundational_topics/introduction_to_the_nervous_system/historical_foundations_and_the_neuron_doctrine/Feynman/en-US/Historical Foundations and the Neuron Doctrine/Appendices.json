            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Historical Context:** A nineteenth-century anatomist observes nervous tissue using then-standard light microscopy.\n- **Observation:** \"extensive continuity of silver-impregnated fibers\".\n- **Initial Hypothesis:** The anatomist tentatively endorses the \"reticular theory\", which posits a \"syncytial network\".\n- **Task:** Craft and select a historically grounded critique that explains the empirical motivation for the reticular theory and identifies the decisive counter-evidence that favored the neuron doctrine.\n- **Provided Foundational Bases:**\n    1.  **Cell Theory (CT):** Cells are the fundamental units of life, bounded by membranes maintaining discrete cytoplasmic compartments.\n    2.  **Optical Resolution Limit:** The Abbe diffraction limit, $d \\approx \\lambda/(2\\,\\mathrm{NA})$, where $d$ is the minimum resolvable distance. Given visible light $\\lambda \\approx 500$ nanometers and a high numerical aperture $\\mathrm{NA} \\approx 1.4$, the resolution limit $d$ is on the order of $200$ nanometers. This constrains light microscopy from resolving closely apposed membranes.\n    3.  **Golgi \"black reaction\":** Sparsely impregnates subsets of cells, revealing neuronal morphology.\n    4.  **Inferential Evidence:** Degeneration experiments (e.g., Wallerian degeneration) and developmental observations (e.g., growth cones) provide causal tests of structural hypotheses.\n    5.  **Ultrastructural Evidence:** Electron Microscopy (EM), specifically Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), later provided evidence of membrane-bounded neurons and synaptic clefts at a scale below the light microscope's resolution limit.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the history of neuroscience and established principles of biology and physics. The reticular theory versus neuron doctrine debate was a central, historical scientific controversy. The provided \"foundational bases\" are all factually correct: Cell Theory is fundamental to biology; the Abbe diffraction limit is a core principle of optics, and the numerical values provided ($\\lambda \\approx 500$ nm, $\\mathrm{NA} \\approx 1.4$, $d \\approx 200$ nm) are standard and correctly calculated ($d \\approx 500 / (2 \\times 1.4) \\approx 178.6$ nm); the roles of the Golgi stain, degeneration experiments, and electron microscopy are all historically accurate. The statement is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks to identify the best critique from a list of options based on a clear set of provided facts. A unique and best solution can be determined through logical deduction and knowledge of the subject.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, unbiased, and free of subjective claims. It describes a historical scenario and provides the scientific context needed for its analysis.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It provides all necessary information to evaluate the historical and scientific merits of the competing theories and the evidence used to resolve the debate. There are no contradictions.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated, historically and scientifically accurate question. I will now proceed with the solution derivation and option evaluation.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe core task is to identify the critique that correctly balances two aspects: ($1$) the rational, evidence-based reasons for the reticular theory's plausibility at the time, and ($2$) the decisive evidence that led to its rejection in favor of the neuron doctrine.\n\n**1. Justification for Reticular Theory:**\nThe primary evidence for the reticular theory was observational. Using staining techniques like the silver nitrate methods available at the time, nervous tissue appeared as a dense, tangled net of fibers. The foundational basis regarding the Abbe diffraction limit provides the physical explanation. A typical synaptic cleft, the gap between two neurons, is approximately $20-40$ nanometers wide. A high-quality light microscope from that era, limited by diffraction, had a maximum resolution of $d \\approx 200$ nanometers. Since the gap between neurons ($20-40$ nm) is an order of magnitude smaller than the minimum resolvable distance ($~200$ nm), it was physically impossible to visualize the synaptic cleft. Therefore, observing an apparently continuous network and inferring a physical continuity (a syncytium) was a rational, albeit ultimately incorrect, conclusion based on the available data and instrumentation.\n\n**2. Evidence Favoring the Neuron Doctrine:**\nThe provided bases point to several lines of evidence championed by Santiago Ramón y Cajal, who is the principal figure associated with the neuron doctrine.\n- **Anatomical Evidence (Golgi Method):** Camillo Golgi himself invented the \"black reaction\" but interpreted its results as supporting the reticular theory. Cajal's critical insight was to use this same method, which stains only a small fraction of neurons, to trace individual cells from end to end. He meticulously documented that axons and dendrites had free endings (e.g., terminal boutons on axons, dendritic spines) and were not fused with neighboring cells.\n- **Developmental Evidence (Growth Cones):** Cajal's observations of developing nerve tissue revealed that axons terminate in a structure he named the growth cone, which appeared to be an independent, motile structure navigating its environment to form connections. This strongly suggested that neurons develop as individual units, not as parts of a pre-formed network.\n- **Pathological Evidence (Wallerian Degeneration):** When an axon is severed from its parent cell body, the distal segment degenerates. This experiment (Wallerian degeneration) demonstrates that the neuron is a single trophic and metabolic unit. If the nervous system were a true syncytium, nutrients and signals from the surrounding network might be expected to prevent or alter this distinct, compartmentalized degeneration.\n- **Definitive Confirmation (Electron Microscopy):** While Cajal's evidence was overwhelmingly convincing, the debate was not formally and visually settled until the development of the electron microscope in the mid-20th century. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) had the necessary resolution to directly visualize the synaptic cleft, showing a clear physical separation between the presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron membranes, thus providing incontrovertible proof for the neuron doctrine.\n\nA complete critique must incorporate these points.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Reticular theory arose as a rational inference from continuous-appearing preparations seen under light microscopy constrained by the Abbe limit, $d \\approx \\lambda/(2\\,\\mathrm{NA})$, which could not resolve synaptic clefts on the order of $20$-$40$ nanometers. However, careful application of the Golgi method by Santiago Ramón y Cajal revealed axonal endings that terminate as discrete boutons and developmental growth cones that do not fuse into a network; Wallerian degeneration demonstrated compartmentalized failure restricted to the distal axon; and later TEM showed apposed membranes separated by a synaptic cleft, confirming discrete, membrane-bounded neurons. While electrical coupling via gap junctions exists, it represents local exceptions and does not re-establish a global syncytium.**\n\nThis option is a textbook summary of the historical and scientific resolution of the debate. It correctly identifies the role of the Abbe limit in explaining the initial reticularist observations. It then accurately lists the multiple lines of evidence used by Cajal (anatomical, developmental, pathological) that supported neuronal discreteness. It correctly positions TEM as the final, definitive proof. Finally, it includes the sophisticated nuance that gap junctions exist but do not support the original global syncytium concept. This option aligns perfectly with the provided foundational bases and the derived analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Reticular theory lacked any empirical motivation and was a purely metaphysical claim. The Golgi method immediately proved neurons are discrete even before Cajal’s work, and electron microscopy was irrelevant to resolving the debate because synapses were already obvious in early light microscopy.**\n\nThis option contains multiple factual errors. The reticular theory was not metaphysical; it was based on empirical (though limited) observation. The Golgi method was invented by Golgi, a leading reticularist; it did not \"immediately prove\" discreteness, and certainly not before Cajal's work, which was the crucial interpretative step. The claim that synapses were \"obvious\" in light microscopy is a direct contradiction of optical physics (the Abbe limit) and historical fact. EM was critically relevant.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Reticular theory was defensible because of continuous fiber staining under light microscopy, but it was decisively refuted primarily by the discovery of the all-or-none action potential, since an all-or-none response can only occur if cells are fully discrete; therefore, electrophysiology alone settled the question without any need for ultrastructural evidence.**\n\nThis option misrepresents the key evidence. While electrophysiology (e.g., Sherrington's work on synaptic delay) provided important functional evidence for a gap between neurons, the debate was primarily anatomical. The \"decisive\" refutation in the minds of anatomists came from Cajal's work, confirmed by EM. The logical leap that all-or-none potentials *require* discrete cells is an oversimplification; syncytial tissues like cardiac muscle also exhibit all-or-none action potentials. The claim that electrophysiology *alone* settled the question and that ultrastructural evidence was not needed is historically false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Reticular theory was supported by silver staining that revealed continuous neurofibrils, but it was ultimately disproven when later silver stains demonstrated uninterrupted continuity throughout the central nervous system (CNS) that paradoxically made the network too uniform to be functional, forcing scientists to abandon the theory.**\n\nThis option is illogical and factually backward. The \"later silver stains\" (i.e., Cajal's use of the Golgi method) demonstrated the *opposite* of uninterrupted continuity—they showed free endings. The reasoning for abandoning the theory is nonsensical; a theory is not disproven by evidence that appears to confirm it \"too much.\"\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Reticular theory emerged due to fixation artifacts that interrupted true continuity; modern live imaging has revealed that neuronal processes are in fact continuous cytoplasm and synaptic clefts are artifacts of tissue shrinkage, meaning neuron doctrine is an artifact of preparation technique.**\n\nThis option promotes a thoroughly debunked, pseudoscientific claim. It inverts reality. The neuron doctrine is one of the most robustly confirmed principles in all of biology. Modern live imaging, super-resolution microscopy, and multiple EM techniques (including those designed to minimize artifacts, like freeze-fracture) have repeatedly and definitively confirmed the existence of discrete neurons and synaptic clefts. This statement is factually and scientifically baseless.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that is historically accurate, scientifically sound, and comprehensive. It correctly captures the rationale for the reticular view's emergence and the multi-pronged evidence that led to its replacement by the neuron doctrine, exactly as requested by the problem statement and its foundational bases.",

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem asks for an experimental design and decision criterion to distinguish between a neural syncytium and discrete neural cells, based on the following givens:\n-   **Objective**: To decide whether neural processes form a cytoplasmic syncytium or are parts of discrete, cytoplasmically separated cells.\n-   **Methodology**: A hypothetical experiment using serial sections of nervous tissue, imaged with stains for cytoplasm and plasma membrane.\n-   **Fundamental Axiom**: The cell theory's definition that the cytoplasm of a cell is bounded by a plasma membrane is assumed to be true.\n-   **Constraint**: The decision must be made without presupposing either the reticular theory (syncytium) or the neuron doctrine (discrete cells).\n-   **Imaging Limitation**: Gaps narrower than the imaging resolution may not be resolved.\n-   **Definitions**:\n    -   $N$: The number of neuronal somata in the tissue volume.\n    -   Path: A contiguous set of voxels labeled as cytoplasm, where successive voxels are adjacent. A path is interrupted if it crosses any voxel labeled as membrane.\n-   **Physical and Experimental Parameters**:\n    -   $w$: The characteristic minimum separation distance between apposed cells (i.e., the width of the extracellular space or synaptic cleft).\n    -   $\\rho$: The lateral imaging resolution.\n    -   $\\delta$: The section thickness, which represents the axial sampling step.\n    -   $f_m$: The per-voxel false negative rate for membrane labeling (i.e., probability of missing a membrane that is present).\n    -   $f_c$: The per-voxel false positive rate for cytoplasm labeling (i.e., probability of labeling a non-cytoplasmic voxel as cytoplasm).\n    -   $N_s$: The number of close appositions within the volume where a false continuity might be inferred.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is scrutinized for validity.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The question addresses the historical and fundamental debate between the reticular theory and the neuron doctrine. It frames the debate in terms of modern cell theory and the practical limitations of microscopy (resolution, sampling, staining artifacts). This is a well-established topic in neurobiology. The principles are sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a method to distinguish between two mutually exclusive hypotheses (syncytium vs. discrete cells) based on a defined set of tools and axioms. It formalizes the challenge by introducing variables for resolution, sampling, and error rates, which allows for a quantitative and logical evaluation of potential solutions.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased. It explicitly forbids \"presupposing either the reticular theory or the neuron doctrine,\" forcing a solution based only on the provided axioms and data.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic in its conception of experimental challenges, well-posed, and non-trivial. It requires a rigorous understanding of experimental design, imaging principles, and statistical error control.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed to derive the solution and evaluate each option.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to devise an experiment that can reliably test for cytoplasmic continuity between neurons. According to the provided axiom from cell theory, two neuronal somata, $A$ and $B$, belong to discrete cells if their respective cytoplasmic volumes are fully enclosed by their own plasma membranes and are not continuous. They form a syncytium if there is a path of cytoplasm connecting them that is not interrupted by a plasma membrane.\n\nAn ideal experiment must therefore be able to:\n1.  Simultaneously visualize both the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane.\n2.  Have sufficient resolution and sampling frequency to reliably detect the presence or absence of a membrane in the gap between two closely apposed neuronal processes. The characteristic width of this gap is given as $w$.\n3.  Account for and control the rate of artifacts (false continuities) that arise from experimental errors, such as imperfect staining.\n\nLet's analyze the requirements for resolution and sampling.\n-   **Lateral Resolution ($\\rho$)**: To distinguish a gap of width $w$ from a continuous structure, the imaging resolution must be significantly better than $w$. The condition $\\rho < w$ is necessary. If $\\rho \\ge w$, the gap would be blurred and could be indistinguishable from a continuous cytoplasmic bridge.\n-   **Axial Sampling ($\\delta$)**: Serial sectioning is a sampling process in the axial ($z$) dimension. A gap (a membrane-bounded space) could potentially lie entirely between two consecutive sections if the sections are too thick. To guarantee that a feature of axial extent $w$ is intersected by at least one section plane, the sampling interval (section thickness $\\delta$) must be less than $w$. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem suggests that for faithful reconstruction, the sampling rate should be more than twice the highest frequency in the signal. A conservative and robust condition is to require $\\delta < w/2$, which ensures that any gap of width $w$ is sampled multiple times axially, preventing it from being missed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the requirement for artifact control.\nA false continuity between two separate cells can occur if, at a point of close apposition, the membranes are present but not labeled (a false negative, probability $f_m$) and/or the extracellular space is mislabeled as cytoplasm (a false positive, probability $f_c$). The problem states there are $N_s$ such potential sites in the volume. If we assume the two error types can independently lead to a spurious bridge at a site, the probability of an artifactual connection at any one site is related to $f_m$ and $f_c$. A simple upper-bound estimate for the probability of a spurious connection at one site is $(f_m + f_c)$. The expected number of false connections across the entire volume is thus approximately $N_s(f_m + f_c)$. For any observed continuity to be considered genuine, the expected number of artifactual continuities must be very low, ideally much less than $1$. The condition $N_s(f_m + f_c) < 1$ sets a rigorous threshold, ensuring that the entire experiment is expected to produce less than one false positive connection.\n\nWith these principles established, we can evaluate the options.\n\n**A. Dual-label cytoplasm and plasma membrane in ultrathin serial sections, reconstruct the volume, and test for cytoplasmic connectivity between distinct somata: declare a syncytium if there exists at least one cytoplasmic path connecting soma $A$ to soma $B$ without crossing any membrane voxels; otherwise declare discrete cells. Require $\\rho < w$, $\\delta < w/2$, and error rates satisfying $N_s\\,(f_m + f_c) < 1$ to keep the expected number of spurious cross-cell links below $1$.**\n-   **Method**: This approach directly implements the test derived from the cell theory axiom. It uses dual labeling to see both the \"content\" (cytoplasm) and the \"boundary\" (membrane).\n-   **Decision Rule**: The rule is a direct and logical application of the definition of cellular discreteness.\n-   **Conditions**: The proposed conditions are precisely those derived above as necessary for a rigorous experiment. $\\rho < w$ for lateral resolution, $\\delta < w/2$ for adequate axial sampling, and $N_s(f_m + f_c) < 1$ for quantitative control of artifacts. This design is robust, logical, and non-presumptive.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option describes a complete and scientifically rigorous experimental design that directly addresses the question while controlling for the primary sources of error.\n\n**B. Use a single cytoplasmic stain that randomly fills neuronal processes in serial sections, reconstruct apparent overlaps, and declare a syncytium if any process profiles visually overlap in adjacent sections. Imaging may be done at $\\rho \\approx 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ with $\\delta \\approx 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$; random, partial filling is acceptable because overlap implies continuity.**\n-   **Method**: This is analogous to classical light microscopy with Golgi staining. It uses only a cytoplasmic stain, so it cannot test for the presence of a bounding membrane.\n-   **Decision Rule**: \"Visual overlap\" is an ambiguous criterion. At the specified resolution ($\\rho \\approx 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$) and section thickness ($\\delta = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), one cannot resolve the synaptic cleft (typically $w \\approx 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}$). Therefore, $\\rho \\gg w$ and $\\delta \\gg w$. Apparent overlap is guaranteed, irrespective of actual continuity.\n-   **Conditions**: The imaging parameters are explicitly insufficient to resolve the critical structures. The claim \"overlap implies continuity\" is precisely the fallacy that this experiment is supposed to avoid.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This method is fundamentally flawed due to the lack of membrane labeling and inadequate resolution and sampling.\n\n**C. Label only plasma membranes in serial sections and count closed membrane loops in each section; if many closed loops are observed, declare discrete cells because closed rings indicate isolated compartments. Resolution and section thickness may be chosen such that $\\rho \\gg w$ and $\\delta \\gg w$ to maximize contrast.**\n-   **Method**: This method abandons the cytoplasm label, making it impossible to check for cytoplasmic continuity. A \"closed loop\" in a 2D section is just a cross-section of a 3D object; it does not prove that the object is a discrete cell. For example, a single, continuous, branched reticulum could produce many such \"closed loops\" in cross-section.\n-   **Conditions**: The explicit choice of poor resolution ($\\rho \\gg w$) and coarse sampling ($\\delta \\gg w$) makes it impossible to trace the fine structure of membranes and determine if they form truly closed surfaces.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The method is indirect, inconclusive, and employs intentionally inadequate imaging parameters.\n\n**D. In serial sections, count the number of geometric intersections between axonal and dendritic profiles; if the intersection count per unit volume exceeds a threshold, declare a syncytium because intersection implies continuity. Imaging parameters may be arbitrary as long as profiles can be segmented.**\n-   **Method**: This method confuses geometric proximity with cytoplasmic continuity. An \"intersection\" of two process profiles in a 3D model means they pass close to each other. This is a prerequisite for a synapse in the neuron doctrine, but it is not evidence for a syncytium.\n-   **Decision Rule**: The rule is based on a false premise. A high density of connections is characteristic of a complex, discretely wired brain, not a syncytium. \"Intersection\" does not imply \"continuity.\"\n-   **Conditions**: Stating that imaging parameters can be \"arbitrary\" is unscientific.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option fundamentally misinterprets the biological question.\n\n**E. Dual-label cytoplasm and a specialized synaptic protein in serial sections; declare discrete cells if protein puncta co-localize with membrane appositions, because this indicates specialized junctions rather than continuity. Use $\\rho \\approx w$ and arbitrary $\\delta$; artifact control is not required because specialized proteins define the junction type.**\n-   **Method**: This method relies on labeling a \"specialized synaptic protein.\"\n-   **Decision Rule**: The rule is that the presence of this protein signifies a junction between discrete cells. This is circular reasoning. It presupposes the neuron doctrine by assuming that such proteins are markers of a non-continuous junction. The goal is to determine *if* cells are discrete, not to assume it based on molecular markers whose function is interpreted under that very assumption.\n-   **Conditions**: The condition $\\rho \\approx w$ is marginal, not sufficient. An \"arbitrary $\\delta$\" is unacceptable for 3D reconstruction. The dismissal of artifact control (\"not required\") is a hallmark of poor experimental design.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This approach is invalid due to circular reasoning (presupposing the neuron doctrine) and flawed experimental parameters.\n\nIn summary, only Option A presents a comprehensive, logically sound, and rigorous experimental protocol that respects the problem's constraints. It relies solely on the fundamental definition of a cell, employs appropriate technology and parameters, and correctly incorporates quantitative controls for potential artifacts.",

The fact that $R_i$ and $a$ are unchanged is explicitly stated.\n- **Consistency**: The definitions and data are internally consistent and do not present any contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in biophysics. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe task is to determine the fold-change in conduction velocity, $$\\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}}$$. We start from the given scaling relationship $$v \\propto \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau}$$. This implies that the ratio of velocities can be written as:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}} / \\tau^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}} / \\tau^{\\text{un}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}}\\right) $$\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the length constant $$\\lambda$$ in terms of the specific parameters.\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} $$\nSubstitute the definitions for $$r_m$$ and $$r_i$$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^{2}}{R_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}a}{2R_{i}}} $$\nSince the axon radius $$a$$ and internal resistivity $$R_i$$ are constant, $$\\lambda$$ is proportional to $$\\sqrt{R_m}$$. The ratio of the length constants is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}a / (2R_{i})}}{\\sqrt{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}a / (2R_{i})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}} $$\n\nNext, we find the ratio of the time constants. The time constant $$\\tau$$ is defined as:\n$$ \\tau = R_{m}C_{m} $$\nThe ratio of the unmyelinated to the myelinated time constant is:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}} = \\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\n\nNow, we combine these two ratios to find the fold-change in velocity:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^{\\text{my}}}{\\lambda^{\\text{un}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\tau^{\\text{un}}}{\\tau^{\\text{my}}}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}} \\cdot \\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified. Let $$x = R_{m}^{\\text{my}}$$ and $$y = R_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$. The resistance-dependent part of the expression is $$\\sqrt{x/y} \\cdot (y/x) = x^{1/2}y^{-1/2} \\cdot y^{1}x^{-1} = y^{1/2}x^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{y/x}$$. Thus, the final symbolic expression for the velocity ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{R_{m}^{\\text{my}}}} \\cdot \\frac{C_{m}^{\\text{un}}}{C_{m}^{\\text{my}}} $$\n\nThe neuron doctrine, which posits that neurons are discrete, individual cells, is the foundational concept that allows for the structural and functional specialization of axons necessary for saltatory conduction. An axon is a continuous process of a single neuron, but it is not uniform. In myelinated axons, this discrete cellular unit is modified, with glial cells wrapping internodal sections while leaving small gaps, the nodes of Ranvier. This specialization is directly captured by the parameters $$R_{m}$$ and $$C_{m}$$. The myelin sheath functions as an electrical insulator, drastically increasing the effective membrane resistance ($$R_{m}^{\\text{my}} \\gg R_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$) because it restricts ion flow across the internodal membrane. Concurrently, by increasing the effective thickness of the membrane capacitor, myelin decreases the effective specific membrane capacitance ($$C_{m}^{\\text{my}} \\ll C_{m}^{\\text{un}}$$). At the nodes of Ranvier—the unmyelinated gaps between discrete glial wrappings—the axonal membrane has a high density of voltage-gated ion channels, allowing for the regeneration of the action potential. Saltatory conduction is the process whereby the action potential propagates rapidly and passively across the high-$$R_m$$, low-$$C_m$$ internode to the next node, where it is actively regenerated. This \"jumping\" is a direct consequence of the non-uniform, segmented structure of the axon, a specialization built upon the fundamental discreteness of the neuron as a cell.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the fold-change using the provided data:\n$$ R_{m}^{\\text{un}} = 1.0 \\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ R_{m}^{\\text{my}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{2} \\,\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^{2} $$\n$$ C_{m}^{\\text{un}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\text{F} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} $$\n$$ C_{m}^{\\text{my}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{F} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} $$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0}{5.0 \\times 10^{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} $$\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{500}} \\cdot \\frac{10^{-2}}{10^{-4}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{500}} \\cdot 10^{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{1}{10\\sqrt{5}} \\cdot 100 = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{5}} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $$\\sqrt{5}$$:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\\sqrt{5} $$\nThe numerical value is:\n$$ \\frac{v^{\\text{my}}}{v^{\\text{un}}} \\approx 2 \\times 2.2360679... = 4.4721359... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the final result is $4.47$.",
