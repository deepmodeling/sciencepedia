This exercise explores the two most fundamental descriptions: the binomial model, which assumes a fixed number of release sites each with an independent probability of release, and its widely used simplification, the Poisson approximation.

The total error is defined as the sum of the absolute errors in the failure probability and the expected amplitude.\n\nFirst, we analyze the exact binomial model. The number of released vesicles, $A$, is a random variable following a binomial distribution, as each of the $n$ release sites acts as an independent Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. We denote this as $A \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$.\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for the binomial distribution is given by:\n$$P(A=k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of vesicles released, and $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$.\nThe given parameters are $n=5$ and $p=0.2$.\n\nThe failure probability, $P_{0, \\text{binom}}$, is the probability that no vesicles are released, i.e., $P(A=0)$.\n$$P_{0, \\text{binom}} = P(A=0) = \\binom{5}{0} (0.2)^0 (1-0.2)^{5-0} = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (0.8)^5$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$P_{0, \\text{binom}} = 0.8^5 = 0.32768$$\n\nThe expected amplitude, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{binom}}[A]$, for a binomial distribution is given by the product of the number of trials and the probability of success.\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{binom}}[A] = n p = 5 \\times 0.2 = 1$$\n\nNext, we analyze the Poisson approximation. The problem specifies that the Poisson process has a mean rate parameter $\\lambda$ equal to the product $n p$.\n$$\\lambda = n p = 5 \\times 0.2 = 1$$\nLet the number of released vesicles under this approximation be $A'$.

            "problem": "A central glutamatergic synapse is modeled as having $n$ independent release sites. On each presynaptic action potential, each site releases a single vesicle with probability $p$, independently of other sites and trials. Each successful vesicle release generates a fixed quantal excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) of amplitude $q$, and the postsynaptic response summates linearly across release sites within a trial. Let $A$ denote the evoked EPSC amplitude measured on a single trial, and suppose that $A$ is measured over many identical trials to estimate its mean $E[A]$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$. An independent quantal analysis provides an estimate of the quantal size $q$.\n\nIn one experiment, the following estimates are obtained: $E[A] = 40$ pA, $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = 160\\,\\mathrm{pA}^2$, and $q = 8$ pA.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of expressions for the number of release sites, $n$, and the release probability, $p$, based on the mean and variance of the evoked excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), $A$, and the quantal size, $q$. It also requires the calculation of $n$ and $p$ from provided data and a discussion of the model's constraints.\n\nThe model assumes that a synapse has $n$ independent release sites. For a single presynaptic action potential, each site $i$ (for $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$) either releases a vesicle or it does not. We can model this with a Bernoulli random variable, $X_i$, for each site:\n$X_i = 1$ if a vesicle is released (with probability $p$).\n$X_i = 0$ if no vesicle is released (with probability $1-p$).\n\nThe total number of vesicles released in a single trial, let's call it $k$, is the sum of these independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli random variables:\n$$k = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\nSince $k$ is a sum of $n$ i.i.d. Bernoulli trials, it follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$.\n\nThe total postsynaptic amplitude, $A$, is the sum of the responses from each vesicle. Since each vesicle contributes a fixed quantal amplitude $q$, and the responses summate linearly, the total amplitude is:\n$$A = qk = q \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$$\n\nOur goal is to find $p$ and $n$ in terms of the mean $E[A]$, variance $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and quantal size $q$. We will use the fundamental properties of expectation and variance.\n\nFirst, let's find the expectation and variance of a single Bernoulli variable $X_i$:\nThe expectation is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = p$.\nThe variance is $\\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = E[X_i^2] - (E[X_i])^2$.\n$E[X_i^2] = 1^2 \\cdot p + 0^2 \\cdot (1-p) = p$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = p - p^2 = p(1-p)$.\n\nNow we can find the expectation of the total amplitude $A$:\nUsing the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[A] = E[qk] = q E[k] = q E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right]$$\n$$E[A] = q \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i] = q \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p = qnp$$\nThis gives our first equation:\n$$E[A] = qnp \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we find the variance of the total amplitude $A$. A key property of variance is that for a constant $c$ and random variable $X$, $\\mathrm{Var}[cX] = c^2 \\mathrm{Var}[X]$. Also, for independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances.\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = \\mathrm{Var}[qk] = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}[k] = q^2 \\mathrm{Var}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right]$$\nSince the $X_i$ are independent:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mathrm{Var}[X_i] = q^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} p(1-p) = q^2 np(1-p)$$\nThis gives our second equation:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np(1-p) \\quad (2)$$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $n$ and $p$. We can solve for them using the measurable quantities $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$.\nLet's rearrange equation $(2)$ by expanding the term $(1-p)$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np - q^2 np^2$$\nNotice that the term $qnp$ is equal to $E[A]$ from equation $(1)$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q(qnp) - q^2 np^2 = qE[A] - q^2 np^2$$\nWe also know $E[A]^2 = (qnp)^2 = q^2 n^2 p^2$. Let's try a different approach by dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$, assuming $E[A] \\neq 0$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]} = \\frac{q^2 np(1-p)}{qnp} = q(1-p)$$\nFrom this ratio, we can solve for $p$:\n$$1-p = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}$$\n$$p = 1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $p$.\n\nTo find $n$, we can substitute this expression for $p$ back into equation $(1)$:\n$$E[A] = qn\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}\\right)$$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$n = \\frac{E[A]}{q\\left(1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]}\\right)} = \\frac{E[A]}{q - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]}}$$\nTo simplify, multiply the numerator and denominator by $E[A]$:\n$$n = \\frac{(E[A])^2}{qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A]}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $n$.\n\nNow we compute the numerical values for the provided data: $E[A] = 40$ pA, $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = 160\\,\\mathrm{pA}^2$, and $q = 8$ pA.\n$$p = 1 - \\frac{160}{8 \\cdot 40} = 1 - \\frac{160}{320} = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n$$n = \\frac{(40)^2}{8 \\cdot 40 - 160} = \\frac{1600}{320 - 160} = \\frac{1600}{160} = 10$$\nSo, the release probability is $p=0.5$ and the number of release sites is $n=10$.\n\nFor a physically meaningful solution under this model, certain constraints on $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$ must hold:\n1.  The number of sites $n$ must be a positive integer, $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$. From its formula, this requires the denominator to be positive: $qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A] > 0$, which means $\\mathrm{Var}[A]  qE[A]$. It also requires the resulting value to be an integer.\n2.  The probability $p$ must be in the range $[0, 1]$.\n    -   $p \\ge 0$ implies $1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\ge 0$, which rearranges to $\\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$. This is consistent with the condition for $n$.\n    -   $p \\le 1$ implies $1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\le 1$, which means $-\\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{qE[A]} \\le 0$. Since variance, mean amplitude, and quantal size are non-negative, this condition is always met.\nTherefore, the primary constraint is $\\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$. We can see this from first principles: $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2 np(1-p)$ and $E[A] = qnp$. The ratio $\\mathrm{Var}[A]/E[A] = q(1-p)$. Since $0 \\le p \\le 1$, we have $0 \\le 1-p \\le 1$, which implies $0 \\le \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}[A]}{E[A]} \\le q$, or $0 \\le \\mathrm{Var}[A] \\le qE[A]$.\n\nRegarding identifiability, the pair $(p, n)$ is uniquely determined by the derived formulas as long as the measured quantities $E[A]$, $\\mathrm{Var}[A]$, and $q$ satisfy the constraints. Specifically, a unique solution exists if $\\mathrm{Var}[A]  qE[A]$.\n- If $\\mathrm{Var}[A] > qE[A]$, the model yields a negative value for $p$, which is non-physical. This implies that the simple binomial model is not a correct description of the synaptic transmission (e.g., $q$ might not be constant, leading to additional variance).\n- If $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = qE[A]$, the formula for $p$ gives $p=0$. If $E[A] > 0$, this is a contradiction, as $p=0$ implies $E[A]=0$. If $E[A]=0$ (and thus $\\mathrm{Var}[A]=0$), $n$ is indeterminate.\n- If $qE[A] - \\mathrm{Var}[A] = 0$ (so $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = qE[A]$) but with $E[A]>0$, this implies from our formula that $p=1-1=0$, which is a contradiction. The only way variance can be zero in this model for a non-zero mean is if $p=1$, not $p=0$. If $p=1$, then $\\mathrm{Var}[A] = q^2n(1)(1-1) = 0$. In this case, $E[A] = qn$, so $n = E[A]/q$. The general formula for $n$ becomes undefined (division by zero), indicating a boundary case where one parameter ($p$) is fixed at its limit.\n- If the calculated value for $n$ is not an integer, it signifies that the experimental data (which contains measurement noise) do not perfectly fit the idealized model. In practice, researchers would assess if the result is close enough to an integer to be plausible or if the deviation suggests the model is inappropriate.",

This relationship is given as:\n$$\np \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^m\n$$\nThis proportionality can be converted into an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, $k$. The constant $k$ encapsulates all other factors that influence release probability, such as the number of available release sites, the density of calcium channels, and intrinsic properties of the release sensor, which are all assumed to be constant in this problem.\n$$\np = k [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]^m\n$$\nWe are given two conditions: an initial (old) state and a final (new) state.\n\nFor the initial state, the calcium concentration is $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{old}} = C$. The corresponding release probability, $p_{\\text{old}}$, is given by:\n$$\np_{\\text{old}} = k (C)^{m}\n$$\nFor the final state, the calcium concentration is increased by a factor of $2$, so $[\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\text{new}} = 2C$. The corresponding new release probability, $p_{\\text{new}}$, is:\n$$\np_{\\text{new}} = k (2C)^{m}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the multiplicative change in release probability, which is the ratio $p_{\\text{new}}/p_{\\text{old}}$.
