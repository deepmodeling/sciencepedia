The values provided for volume, concentration, transporter count, and turnover rate are within plausible biophysical ranges for a model system. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and clear, simplifying assumptions (zero initial concentration, constant rate) that lead to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a standard calculation in biophysics and is directly relevant to the topic of neurotransmitter vesicle filling.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to determine the minimum time, $t$, required for the liposome to reach the specified target concentration of glutamate. The solution proceeds in three stages:\n1.  Calculate the total number of glutamate molecules, $N_{Glu}$, that corresponds to the target concentration in the given lumenal volume.\n2.  Calculate the total rate of transport, $R_{total}$, by which glutamate molecules are pumped into the liposome.\n3.  Calculate the required time $t$ by dividing the total number of molecules by the total transport rate.\n\nFirst, we determine the target number of glutamate molecules, $N_{Glu}$. This is based on the definition of molarity, which relates concentration ($C$), volume ($V$), and the number of moles ($n$). The number of molecules is then found using Avogadro's number, $N_A$.\n\nThe target number of moles of glutamate is:\n$$n_{Glu} = [Glu]_{target} \\times V$$\nThe target number of individual glutamate molecules is:\n$$N_{Glu} = n_{Glu} \\times N_A = [Glu]_{target} \\times V \\times N_A$$\n\nWe must use a consistent set of units. The given values are:\n- $[Glu]_{target} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 100 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}$\n- $V = 30\\,\\mathrm{aL} = 30 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $N_{Glu}$:\n$$N_{Glu} = (0.1\\,\\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$N_{Glu} = (3 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{mol}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$N_{Glu} = 18.066 \\times 10^{5} = 1.8066 \\times 10^{6}$$\n\nSo, $1.8066 \\times 10^{6}$ molecules of glutamate must be transported into the liposome.\n\nNext, we calculate the total transport rate, $R_{total}$. The liposome membrane contains $N=50$ transporters, each with a catalytic turnover number of $k_{cat} = 20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The problem states that each catalytic cycle transports one glutamate molecule. Thus, $k_{cat}$ represents the number of molecules transported per transporter per second. The total rate is the product of the number of transporters and the rate of each individual transporter.\n$$R_{total} = N \\times k_{cat}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{total} = 50 \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$$\nThis means that a total of $1000$ glutamate molecules are transported into the liposome every second.\n\nFinally, we calculate the time $t$ required to reach the target. The problem assumes the process starts with no glutamate in the lumen and the transport rate is constant. Therefore, the time is the total number of molecules required divided by the rate of transport.\n$$t = \\frac{N_{Glu}}{R_{total}}$$\n$$t = \\frac{1.8066 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{molecules}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{molecules \\cdot s^{-1}}}$$\n$$t = 1806.6\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$t \\approx 1810\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nIn scientific notation, this is expressed as $1.81 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",

Vesicles are acidified by the Vacuolar-type Hydrogen Adenosine Triphosphatase (V-ATPase), which generates a proton electrochemical gradient composed of a pH gradient $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ and a transmembrane potential $\\Delta \\psi$. VGAT operates as a proton antiporter, exchanging cytosolic GABA for luminal protons.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in neurobiology concerning the packaging of the neurotransmitter GABA into synaptic vesicles and the downstream consequences of a specific pharmacological manipulation. The task is to validate the problem statement, and if valid, to derive the solution from first principles and evaluate the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   **System**: A presynaptic terminal.\n-   **Neurotransmitter**: Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).\n-   **Vesicular transporter**: Vesicular GABA/glycine Transporter (VGAT), also known as Vesicular Inhibitory Amino Acid Transporter (VIAAT).\n-   **Vesicle acidification**: Mediated by Vacuolar-type Hydrogen Adenosine Triphosphatase (V-ATPase).\n-   **Proton electrochemical gradient**: Generated by V-ATPase, composed of a pH gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and a transmembrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$).\n-   **VGAT mechanism**: Proton antiporter, exchanging cytosolic GABA for luminal protons.\n-   **Stoichiometry**: $n$ protons are exchanged per GABA molecule.\n-   **Driving force**: The proton electrochemical potential difference, $\\Delta \\mu_{H^+}$.\n-   **Steady state condition**: The sum of coupled chemical potential changes for transported species is zero.\n-   **Pharmacological manipulation**: Selective alkalinization of the vesicle lumen.\n-   **Direct effect of manipulation**: Decrease in $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n-   **Constraints/Assumptions**:\n    -   Presynaptic calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) influx is unchanged.\n    -   Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor Attachment protein REceptor (SNARE) complex function is unchanged.\n    -   Vesicle docking status is unchanged.\n    -   Release probability is unchanged.\n    -   Cytosolic GABA concentration is constant.\n    -   Vesicle membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$) is not increased to compensate for the loss of $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n-   **Quantities to predict**:\n    -   GABA quantal content ($Q$), defined as the number of GABA molecules per vesicle.\n    -   Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSC) amplitude.\n    -   mIPSC frequency.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in the established principles of biophysics and neurophysiology. The chemiosmotic coupling model, wherein a primary pump (V-ATPase) establishes a proton electrochemical gradient that is then used by a secondary transporter (VGAT), is the canonical mechanism for loading most small-molecule neurotransmitters into vesicles. All components mentioned (V-ATPase, VGAT, SNAREs) and concepts ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$, $\\Delta \\psi$, mIPSCs) are standard in the field.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines the system, the manipulation, and crucial boundary conditions (e.g., constant cytosolic GABA, no compensation by $\\Delta \\psi$, unchanged release machinery). This allows for the isolation of the variable of interest ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and the deduction of its specific consequences.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms, free from ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no discernible flaws. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution from First Principles\n\n1.  **Electrochemical Potential and Driving Force**: The transport of substances across a membrane is governed by their electrochemical potential difference. For an ion, this includes both a chemical (concentration) component and an electrical (potential) component. The total free energy change for moving a mole of protons ($H^+$) from the cytosol ('cyto') into the vesicle lumen ('lumen') is given by the change in their electrochemical potential, $\\Delta \\mu_{H^+}$:\n    $$ \\Delta \\mu_{H^+} = R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} + z F (\\psi_{lumen} - \\psi_{cyto}) $$\n    where $R$ is the gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $z$ is the charge of the ion (for $H^+$, $z = +1$), $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential.\n\n2.  **Relating to $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ and $\\Delta \\psi$**: The terms in the equation can be expressed using the given variables.\n    -   The electrical potential difference across the vesicle membrane is $\\Delta \\psi = \\psi_{lumen} - \\psi_{cyto}$. The V-ATPase pumps protons into the vesicle, making the lumen electrically positive relative to the cytosol, so $\\Delta \\psi > 0$.\n    -   The pH is defined as $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}[H^+]$. The logarithmic term can be rewritten as:\n        $$ R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} = R T \\ln(10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}} / 10^{-\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto}}) = R T \\ln(10^{\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}}) $$\n        $$ = (\\ln 10) R T (\\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}) = -2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen-cyto} $$\n        The problem defines $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ such that a more acidic lumen ($\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}  \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto}$) corresponds to a positive energy contribution. Let's define $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen} > 0$. The potential energy stored in the pH gradient for inward proton movement is thus $-2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$. The energy for *outward* proton movement, which drives GABA import, is $+2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n\n3.  **Thermodynamics of VGAT Antiport**: VGAT is an antiporter that couples the efflux of $n$ protons from the lumen to the influx of one molecule of GABA into the lumen. At physiological pH, GABA is primarily a zwitterion and is electrically neutral. Its transport is driven solely by its chemical potential difference.\n    -   The free energy change to move one mole of GABA from the cytosol to the lumen is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{GABA} = R T \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} $$\n    -   The free energy change to move $n$ moles of protons from the lumen to the cytosol is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{H^+} = -n \\Delta \\mu_{H^+} = -n \\left( R T \\ln\\frac{[H^+]_{lumen}}{[H^+]_{cyto}} + F \\Delta \\psi \\right) = -n \\left(-2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi \\right) $$\n        However, the total driving force provided by the proton gradient (the \"proton-motive force\") is harvested by the transporter. The energy available from moving $n$ protons **out** is:\n        $$ \\Delta G_{H^+ \\ (driving)} = -n(2.303 RT \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) $$\n        This is the energy term that pays for GABA accumulation.\n\n4.  **Steady-State Condition**: The problem states that at steady state, the net free energy change for the coupled transport process is zero. This occurs when the energy required to accumulate GABA against its concentration gradient exactly balances the energy provided by the proton gradient.\n    $$ \\Delta G_{GABA} + \\Delta G_{H^+ \\ (driving)} = 0 $$\n    $$ R T \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} - n(2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) = 0 $$\n    Solving for the steady-state GABA concentration ratio:\n    $$ \\ln\\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} = \\frac{n}{RT} (2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi) $$\n    $$ \\frac{[GABA]_{lumen}}{[GABA]_{cyto}} = \\exp\\left[ n \\left( 2.303 \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + \\frac{F \\Delta \\psi}{RT} \\right) \\right] $$\n    This equation demonstrates that the ability of the vesicle to concentrate GABA is exponentially dependent on the weighted sum of both the pH gradient ($\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$) and the membrane potential ($\\Delta \\psi$).\n\n5.  **Effect of Vesicle Alkalinization**:\n    -   The manipulation \"alkalinizes the vesicle lumen,\" which means $\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$ increases.\n    -   Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH} = \\mathrm{pH}_{cyto} - \\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$, an increase in $\\mathrm{pH}_{lumen}$ causes a **decrease** in $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$.\n    -   According to the problem, $\\Delta \\psi$ does not increase to compensate.\n    -   Therefore, the total driving force for GABA accumulation, which is proportional to $(2.303 R T \\Delta \\mathrm{pH} + F \\Delta \\psi)$, unequivocally **decreases**.\n    -   With a lower driving force, the steady-state concentration of GABA in the vesicle, $[GABA]_{lumen}$, will be lower.\n\n6.  **Consequences for mIPSCs**:\n    -   **Quantal Content ($Q$)**: $Q$ is the number of GABA molecules per vesicle. Since vesicle volume is constant, $Q$ is directly proportional to $[GABA]_{lumen}$. A decrease in $[GABA]_{lumen}$ directly causes a **decrease** in $Q$.\n    -   **mIPSC Amplitude**: The amplitude of an mIPSC is determined by the postsynaptic current generated by the contents of a single vesicle. A lower $Q$ means fewer GABA molecules are released into the synaptic cleft upon vesicle fusion. This leads to a lower peak transient concentration of GABA in the cleft, reduced activation of postsynaptic GABA receptors, and consequently, a **decrease** in the mean mIPSC amplitude.\n    -   **mIPSC Frequency**: The frequency of mIPSCs reflects the rate of spontaneous, action-potential-independent vesicle fusion. The problem explicitly states that the manipulation does not affect the core machinery of exocytosis (SNAREs, docking, release probability). Therefore, the rate of spontaneous fusion events should be unaffected, and mIPSC frequency will **remain unchanged**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Mean mIPSC amplitude decreases while mIPSC frequency remains unchanged, because lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ reduces VGAT’s driving force and lowers $Q$ without altering vesicle release probability or docking.**\n-   This option posits a decrease in mIPSC amplitude and no change in frequency. The reasoning provided is that lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ (correctly interpreted from alkalinization) reduces the driving force for VGAT, which lowers quantal content ($Q$), while release probability is unaltered. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Mean mIPSC amplitude increases while mIPSC frequency remains unchanged, because lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ increases VGAT’s exchange rate and raises $Q$ independently of exocytosis.**\n-   This option incorrectly claims that lowering $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ increases the driving force and raises $Q$. This contradicts the thermodynamic analysis. A lower driving force will lead to less, not more, accumulation of GABA. Consequently, the prediction of increased mIPSC amplitude is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Mean mIPSC amplitude remains unchanged while mIPSC frequency decreases, because vesicle alkalinization impairs SNARE-mediated docking, reducing release probability without affecting packaging.**\n-   This option makes two false claims based on the problem statement. First, it asserts that release probability is reduced, directly contradicting the given constraint that SNARE function, docking, and release probability are unchanged. Second, it claims that packaging is unaffected, which is the primary process altered by changing the proton gradient.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. No change in mean mIPSC amplitude or frequency, because vesicle packaging by VGAT depends only on $\\Delta \\psi$ and not on $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ when cytosolic GABA is constant.**\n-   The core premise that VGAT depends only on $\\Delta \\psi$ is fundamentally flawed. VGAT, as a proton antiporter, utilizes the *entire* proton electrochemical gradient, which has both $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ (chemical) and $\\Delta \\psi$ (electrical) components. Ignoring the $\\Delta \\mathrm{pH}$ component is incorrect. Therefore, the prediction of no change in amplitude is invalid.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Both mean mIPSC amplitude and frequency increase, because alkalinizing the vesicle increases the energy available for VGAT antiport and accelerates vesicle fusion.**\n-   This option is incorrect on two counts. First, alkalinizing the vesicle *decreases* the energy available from the pH gradient component of the proton-motive force. Second, it baselessly assumes that alkalinization accelerates vesicle fusion, a claim for which no support is given and which is implicitly ruled out by the problem's constraints.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Postsynaptic $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPA receptors) operate in a linear, non-saturating regime, so that the miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude $A$ is proportional to the number of glutamate molecules released per vesicle, $N$, i.e., $A = k N$, for some constant $k$ that does not change across the conditions considered.\n\nAssume that osmotic equilibrium makes the internal osmolarity of impermeant solutes equal to the external bath osmolarity, so that the vesicle volume $V$ adjusts accordingly while the number of impermeant molecules inside each vesicle remains fixed.

The concentration (osmolarity) of these impermeant molecules inside the vesicle is $C_{\\mathrm{imp,in}} = N_{\\mathrm{imp}} / V$.\n    The problem provides a key simplifying assumption for osmotic equilibrium: the internal osmolarity of impermeant solutes equals the external bath osmolarity, $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n    $$\n    C_{\\mathrm{imp,in}} = C_{\\mathrm{out}}\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{imp,in}}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{imp}}}{V} = C_{\\mathrm{out}}\n    $$\n    Since $N_{\\mathrm{imp}}$ is constant for each vesicle, we can solve for the volume $V$:\n    $$\n    V = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{imp}}}{C_{\\mathrm{out}}}\n    $$\n    This equation shows that the vesicle volume $V$ is inversely proportional to the external osmolarity $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n    $$\n    V \\propto \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{out}}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Number of Glutamate Molecules and mEPSC Amplitude:**\n    The problem states that the vesicular glutamate transporter maintains a constant luminal glutamate concentration, $C^*$. The total number of glutamate molecules, $N$, in a vesicle of volume $V$ is therefore:\n    $$\n    N = C^* V\n    $$\n    The mEPSC amplitude, $A$, is directly proportional to the number of glutamate molecules released, $N$, with a proportionality constant $k$:\n    $$\n    A = k N\n    $$\n    Substituting the expression for $N$:\n    $$\n    A = k C^* V\n    $$\n\n3.  **Relating mEPSC Amplitude to External Osmolarity:**\n    We can combine the relationships from steps 1 and 2. Since $A \\propto V$ and $V \\propto 1/C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, it follows that the mEPSC amplitude is inversely proportional to the external osmolarity:\n    $$\n    A \\propto \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{out}}}\n    $$\n    We can write this relationship as a ratio. Let $A_0$ be the amplitude at the baseline osmolarity $C_{\\mathrm{out},0}$, and $A_i$ be the amplitude at a new osmolarity $C_{\\mathrm{out},i}$. Then:\n    $$\n    \\frac{A_i}{A_0} = \\frac{1/C_{\\mathrm{out},i}}{1/C_{\\mathrm{out},0}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out},0}}{C_{\\mathrm{out},i}}\n    $$\n    This allows us to calculate the new mean amplitudes.\n\n4.  **Calculating Mean Amplitudes:**\n    The given baseline values are $\\mu_0 = 10$ pA at $C_{\\mathrm{out},0} = 300$ mOsm. Note that $\\mu$ denotes the mean amplitude, which follows the same proportionality.\n\n    -   **Hypotonic Condition ($C_{\\mathrm{out},1} = 200$ mOsm):**\n        The new mean amplitude, $\\mu_1$, is:\n        $$\n        \\mu_1 = \\mu_0 \\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out},0}}{C_{\\mathrm{out},1}} \\right) = (10 \\text{ pA}) \\left( \\frac{300 \\text{ mOsm}}{200 \\text{ mOsm}} \\right) = 10 \\times 1.5 = 15 \\text{ pA}\n        $$\n\n    -   **Hypertonic Condition ($C_{\\mathrm{out},2} = 450$ mOsm):**\n        The new mean amplitude, $\\mu_2$, is:\n        $$\n        \\mu_2 = \\mu_0 \\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{out},0}}{C_{\\mathrm{out},2}} \\right) = (10 \\text{ pA}) \\left( \\frac{300 \\text{ mOsm}}{450 \\text{ mOsm}} \\right) = 10 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 6.67 \\text{ pA} \\text{ or } 6.\\overline{6} \\text{ pA}\n        $$\n\n5.  **Effect on Amplitude Distribution Shape:**\n    The problem states that all vesicle volumes are scaled by the same factor. Let this scaling factor be $\\alpha = V_{\\mathrm{new}}/V_{\\mathrm{old}} = C_{\\mathrm{out,old}}/C_{\\mathrm{out,new}}$. Since $A \\propto V$, the amplitude of every individual mEPSC is also scaled by this factor: $A_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\alpha A_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n    This is a linear transformation of the random variable representing the amplitude distribution.\n    -   The new mean is $\\mu_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\mathbb{E}[\\alpha A_{\\mathrm{old}}] = \\alpha \\mathbb{E}[A_{\\mathrm{old}}] = \\alpha \\mu_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n    -   The new variance is $\\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\text{Var}(\\alpha A_{\\mathrm{old}}) = \\alpha^2 \\text{Var}(A_{\\mathrm{old}}) = \\alpha^2 \\sigma^2_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n    -   The new standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\alpha \\sigma_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n    The coefficient of variation (CV) is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, $CV = \\sigma / \\mu$.\n    The new CV is $CV_{\\mathrm{new}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{new}} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{new}} = (\\alpha \\sigma_{\\mathrm{old}}) / (\\alpha \\mu_{\\mathrm{old}}) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{old}} / \\mu_{\\mathrm{old}} = CV_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n    Thus, the coefficient of variation remains unchanged. This means the shape of the distribution, relative to its mean, is preserved. The distribution is simply stretched or compressed.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Under $C_{\\mathrm{out},1} = 200$ mOsm, the mean mEPSC amplitude increases to $15$ pA, and under $C_{\\mathrm{out},2} = 450$ mOsm, it decreases to $6.\\overline{6}$ pA; the amplitude distribution scales proportionally (its mean and standard deviation are multiplied by the same factor), leaving the coefficient of variation approximately unchanged, because $N = C^{*} V$ and $V \\propto 1/C_{\\mathrm{out}}$.**\n- **Amplitude Predictions:** The predicted amplitudes of $15$ pA and $6.\\overline{6}$ pA exactly match the calculations derived from the problem's premises.\n- **Reasoning:** The provided reason, that $N = C^{*} V$ and $V \\propto 1/C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, is precisely the logic used in the derivation.\n- **Distribution Shape:** The statement that the distribution scales proportionally and the coefficient of variation remains unchanged is also correct, as derived above.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The mean mEPSC amplitudes remain near $10$ pA under both $C_{\\mathrm{out},1} = 200$ mOsm and $C_{\\mathrm{out},2} = 450$ mOsm, because the number of vesicular transporters is unchanged; osmotic manipulations primarily affect mEPSC frequency, not amplitude.**\n- **Amplitude Predictions:** Predicts no change in amplitude, which contradicts the derivation.\n- **Reasoning:** The reasoning is flawed. While the number of transporters is fixed, they maintain a constant *concentration* $C^*$. Since the volume $V$ changes, the total number of glutamate molecules $N = C^* V$ must change. The claim that osmotic manipulations only affect frequency is also an unsubstantiated assertion that contradicts the direct consequences of the model's premises.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Under $C_{\\mathrm{out},1} = 200$ mOsm, the mean mEPSC amplitude decreases to $6.\\overline{6}$ pA, and under $C_{\\mathrm{out},2} = 450$ mOsm, it increases to $15$ pA, because hypotonic conditions dilute the proton gradient and reduce filling, whereas hypertonic conditions concentrate the gradient and enhance filling, with little change in distribution shape.**\n- **Amplitude Predictions:** Predicts the opposite effect (decrease in hypotonic, increase in hypertonic), which directly contradicts the derivation.\n- **Reasoning:** The reasoning introduces a new physical mechanism (osmolarity affecting the proton gradient and thus the filling concentration $C^*$). This mechanism contradicts the problem's explicit premise that $C^*$ is constant. We must solve based on the stated assumptions, not by introducing alternative biophysical models.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Under $C_{\\mathrm{out},1} = 200$ mOsm, the mean mEPSC amplitude increases modestly to $12$ pA, and under $C_{\\mathrm{out},2} = 450$ mOsm, it decreases to $8$ pA, because changes in vesicle surface area slightly alter transporter density per unit area even though transporter number is fixed; the amplitude distribution becomes broader in both conditions due to added variability in volume.**\n- **Amplitude Predictions:** The values of $12$ pA and $8$ pA do not match the derivation.\n- **Reasoning:** Like option C, this option introduces an unstated mechanism (surface area/density effects influencing filling) that would imply $C^*$ is not constant, contradicting the problem's premises.\n- **Distribution Shape:** The claim that the distribution becomes \"broader in both conditions due to added variability\" is incorrect. The model implies a deterministic scaling of all volumes, which preserves the coefficient of variation, not an \"added variability.\"\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
