            "problem": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) primarily acts via the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA-A), a chloride-selective ligand-gated ion channel. In developing neurons, GABA can be depolarizing due to elevated intracellular chloride concentration, whereas in mature neurons, upregulation of the Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter 2 (KCC2) lowers intracellular chloride and renders GABA hyperpolarizing. Consider a neuron where early in development the intracellular chloride concentration is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,early}} = 25$ mM and the extracellular chloride concentration is $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 135$ mM. The temperature is $T = 310$ K. The resting membrane potential is $V_{\\mathrm{m}} = -65$ mV. The KCC2 transporter is electroneutral with a stoichiometry of $1\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+} : 1\\,\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and, at steady state when maximally upregulated, drives the sum of the chemical potentials of potassium and chloride to equality across the membrane, implying an equilibrium relation between concentrations. Assume activity coefficients are approximately unity so that activities equal concentrations.\n\nStarting from the definition of electrochemical potential for an ion species, and the condition for equilibrium (no net electrochemical potential difference), derive the expression for the chloride equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ in terms of $R$, $T$, $F$, valence $z$, and the ratio of extracellular to intracellular chloride concentrations. Separately, starting from the electroneutral cotransporter equilibrium condition for $1\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+} : 1\\,\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, derive the relation linking $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}$, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}$, and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}$ at steady state. Use this to predict the late-stage intracellular chloride concentration $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}}$ given $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = 140$ mM and $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 4$ mM, with $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}$ unchanged.\n\nUsing your derived $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ expression, compute $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,early}}$ and $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,late}}$ and determine whether the action of GABA via GABA-A is depolarizing or hyperpolarizing in each case by comparing $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the chloride equilibrium potential, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$, also known as the Nernst potential for chloride. The electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}_j$, for an ion species $j$ is given by the sum of its chemical potential and its electrical potential energy per mole:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln[j] + z_j F V $$\nwhere $\\mu_j^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $[j]$ is the molar concentration of the ion (assuming activity coefficient is unity), $z_j$ is the valence of the ion, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $V$ is the electrical potential.\n\nAt equilibrium, there is no net flux of the ion across the membrane, which implies that the electrochemical potential of the ion is the same on both sides of the membrane (intracellular, 'i', and extracellular, 'o'). For chloride ions ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), this condition is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl,i}} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{\\mathrm{Cl,o}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for electrochemical potential:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F V_{\\mathrm{i}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} + z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F V_{\\mathrm{o}} $$\nThe standard chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0$ is identical on both sides and cancels out. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference across the membrane, $V_{\\mathrm{m}} = V_{\\mathrm{i}} - V_{\\mathrm{o}}$, which at equilibrium is the equilibrium potential $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$:\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F (V_{\\mathrm{i}} - V_{\\mathrm{o}}) = RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} - RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} $$\n$$ z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} F E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right) $$\nSolving for $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$ yields the Nernst equation for chloride:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right) $$\nThis completes the first required derivation.\n\nNext, we derive the equilibrium relation for the electroneutral Potassium-Chloride Cotransporter 2 (KCC2), which has a stoichiometry of $1\\,\\mathrm{K}^{+}:1\\,\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The problem states that at steady state, the sum of the chemical potentials of potassium and chloride is equal across the membrane. This means that the combined chemical potential of the transported species is the same inside and outside the cell. Note that since the transporter is electroneutral (transporting charges $z_{\\mathrm{K}}=+1$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}=-1$ together), the process is independent of the membrane potential. The equilibrium condition can be written as:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{K,i}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl,i}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{K,o}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl,o}} $$\nwhere $\\mu_j = \\mu_j^0 + RT \\ln[j]$ is the chemical potential.\n$$ (\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}) + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}) = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{K}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}) + (\\mu_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^0 + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}) $$\nThe standard potentials cancel.\n$$ RT \\ln[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = RT \\ln[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}} + RT \\ln[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} $$\n$$ RT \\ln([\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}}) = RT \\ln([\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}) $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the desired relation:\n$$ [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} $$\n\nUsing this relation, we predict the late-stage intracellular chloride concentration, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}}$, given the mature neuron concentrations.\n$$ [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}}} $$\nSubstituting the provided values: $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{i}} = 140$ mM, $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 4$ mM, and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 135$ mM.\n$$ [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}} = \\frac{(4\\,\\text{mM})(135\\,\\text{mM})}{140\\,\\text{mM}} = \\frac{540}{140}\\,\\text{mM} = \\frac{27}{7}\\,\\text{mM} \\approx 3.857\\,\\text{mM} $$\n\nNow, we compute the chloride equilibrium potentials for both the early and late developmental stages.

This is a depolarizing effect.\n\nFor the late stage: $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}} = \\frac{27}{7}$ mM and $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}} = 135$ mM.\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl,late}} = (-26.712\\,\\text{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{135}{27/7}\\right) = (-26.712\\,\\text{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{135 \\times 7}{27}\\right) = (-26.712\\,\\text{mV}) \\ln(35) \\approx -94.96\\,\\text{mV} $$\nSince $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,late}}  V_{\\mathrm{m}}$, opening GABA-A channels will cause an influx of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ ions, shifting the membrane potential towards $E_{\\mathrm{Cl,late}}$. This is a hyperpolarizing effect.\n\nFinally, we compute the shift in the chloride equilibrium potential, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = E_{\\mathrm{Cl,late}} - E_{\\mathrm{Cl,early}}$.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\left[ \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}}}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,early}}}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}F} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{o}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,early}}}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}F} \\ln\\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,early}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{i,late}}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the values and constants, with $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{(8.314)(310)}{(-1)(96485)} \\ln\\left( \\frac{25}{27/7} \\right) = (-0.026712\\,\\text{V}) \\ln\\left( \\frac{175}{27} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\approx (-0.026712\\,\\text{V}) \\times (1.86895) \\approx -0.0499214\\,\\text{V} = -49.9214\\,\\text{mV} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the shift is $-49.92$ mV.",

The $g$-ratio is defined as $g = \\frac{d}{D}$. A well-tested empirical observation in neurobiology is that, for myelinated fibers, the conduction velocity $v$ scales approximately linearly with the outer fiber diameter $D$ over a broad range of diameters, reflecting how internodal length and nodal dynamics scale with fiber size.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the scaling observation, derive the proportional dependence of $v$ on $d$ and $g$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the proportional dependence of conduction velocity $v$ on axon diameter $d$ and g-ratio $g$, and subsequently, the calculation of a specific ratio of velocities under given conditions. The solution proceeds in two parts.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between $v$, $d$, and $g$. The problem provides two key pieces of information:\n1.  The definition of the g-ratio, $g$, as the ratio of the inner axon diameter $d$ to the outer fiber diameter $D$:\n    $$g = \\frac{d}{D}$$\n2.  An empirical scaling law stating that the conduction velocity $v$ is approximately proportional to the outer fiber diameter $D$:\n    $$v \\propto D$$\n\nThe proportionality $v \\propto D$ can be expressed as an equation by introducing a constant of proportionality, $k$. This constant encapsulates biophysical parameters that are not dependent on the fiber geometry for this analysis.\n$$v = kD$$\n\nOur goal is to express $v$ in terms of $d$ and $g$. To do this, we first rearrange the definition of the g-ratio to solve for the outer diameter $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{d}{g}$$\nThis expression is valid for any non-zero $g$, which is a physical necessity for an axon.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $D$ into our equation for the conduction velocity $v$:\n$$v = k \\left( \\frac{d}{g} \\right)$$\nThis equation reveals the proportional dependence of $v$ on both $d$ and $g$. The relationship can be stated as:\n$$v \\propto \\frac{d}{g}$$\nThis proportionality indicates that for a fixed g-ratio, conduction velocity scales linearly with the axon diameter. Conversely, for a fixed axon diameter, conduction velocity is inversely proportional to the g-ratio.\n\nSecond, we compute the ratio of the conduction velocities for two different g-ratios, while the axon diameter $d$ is held constant. The specific value $d = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is provided, but as we will demonstrate, its value is not required for the final ratio.\n\nLet $v_1$ be the conduction velocity when the g-ratio is $g_1 = 0.7$, and let $v_2$ be the conduction velocity when the g-ratio is $g_2 = 0.8$. The problem asks for the ratio of the velocity at $g=0.8$ to the velocity at $g=0.7$, which is $\\frac{v_2}{v_1}$.\n\nUsing the relationship $v = k \\frac{d}{g}$, we can write expressions for $v_1$ and $v_2$:\n$$v_1 = k \\frac{d}{g_1}$$\n$$v_2 = k \\frac{d}{g_2}$$\n\nNow, we form the ratio $\\frac{v_2}{v_1}$:\n$$\\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{k \\frac{d}{g_2}}{k \\frac{d}{g_1}}$$\nSince the proportionality constant $k$ and the axon diameter $d$ are the same for both conditions, they cancel out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{g_2}}{\\frac{1}{g_1}} = \\frac{g_1}{g_2}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values for the g-ratios, $g_1 = 0.7$ and $g_2 = 0.8$:\n$$\\frac{v_2}{v_1} = \\frac{0.7}{0.8}$$\nTo express this value as a simplified fraction, we convert the decimals to fractions and simplify:\n$$\\frac{0.7}{0.8} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{10}}{\\frac{8}{10}} = \\frac{7}{10} \\times \\frac{10}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$$\nThus, the ratio of the conduction velocity when $g = 0.8$ to the conduction velocity when $g = 0.7$ is $\\frac{7}{8}$.
