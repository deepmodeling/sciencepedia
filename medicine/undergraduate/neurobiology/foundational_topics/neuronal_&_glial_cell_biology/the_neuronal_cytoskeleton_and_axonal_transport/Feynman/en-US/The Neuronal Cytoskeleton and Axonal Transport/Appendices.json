            "problem": "An axonal vesicle is simultaneously engaged by plus-end-directed kinesin-1 motors and minus-end-directed cytoplasmic dynein motors on a uniformly polarized axonal microtubule, whose plus ends point distally. In a simplified tug-of-war model, assume the following: (i) each engaged motor contributes up to its stall force before detachment, (ii) forces sum linearly within a team and the load is shared equally among motors on the same team, (iii) there is no regulatory coordination beyond mechanical coupling, and (iv) the vesicle’s inertia is negligible so that the instantaneous direction of motion is determined by the sign of the net motor-generated force.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the likely direction of motion of an axonal vesicle and to compute the signed net excess stall force acting upon it. The vesicle is subject to forces from two opposing teams of molecular motors: plus-end-directed kinesin-1 and minus-end-directed cytoplasmic dynein.\n\nLet us define the variables and constants as provided:\n- Number of kinesin-1 motors: $N_k = 2$.\n- Stall force of a single kinesin-1 motor: $F_k = 6\\,\\text{pN}$.\n- Number of cytoplasmic dynein motors: $N_d = 3$.\n- Stall force of a single dynein motor: $F_d = 1.2\\,\\text{pN}$.\n\nThe problem establishes a sign convention where the plus-end (anterograde) direction is positive. Therefore, forces generated by kinesin motors are positive, and forces generated by dynein motors are negative.\n\nAccording to the model's assumption (ii), the forces generated by motors within a team sum linearly. Thus, we can calculate the total stall capacity for each team. The total stall capacity of a team represents the maximum force that team can generate in its preferred direction.\n\nThe total stall capacity of the plus-end-directed kinesin team, $F_{\\text{team}, k}$, is the product of the number of kinesin motors and the stall force per motor:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, k} = N_k \\times F_k$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, k} = 2 \\times 6\\,\\text{pN} = 12\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nThe total stall capacity of the minus-end-directed dynein team, $F_{\\text{team}, d}$, is the product of the number of dynein motors and the stall force per motor:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, d} = N_d \\times F_d$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F_{\\text{team}, d} = 3 \\times 1.2\\,\\text{pN} = 3.6\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the \"signed net excess stall force,\" which is explicitly defined as \"the total plus-end team stall capacity minus the total minus-end team stall capacity.\" Let us denote this quantity as $F_{\\text{excess}}$. Applying the sign convention, the kinesin team's capacity is positive and the dynein team's capacity is effectively a negative contribution to the net force, though the definition asks for the difference of their magnitudes.\n$$F_{\\text{excess}} = F_{\\text{team}, k} - F_{\\text{team}, d}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated total stall capacities:\n$$F_{\\text{excess}} = 12\\,\\text{pN} - 3.6\\,\\text{pN} = 8.4\\,\\text{pN}$$\n\nAccording to assumption (iv), the vesicle's inertia is negligible, and the instantaneous direction of motion is determined by the sign of the net motor-generated force. In this tug-of-war model, the net force is represented by the signed net excess stall force. Since $F_{\\text{excess}} = +8.4\\,\\text{pN}$ is a positive value, the net force is directed towards the plus-end of the microtubule. Therefore, the likely direction of motion is anterograde (distal).\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the value of the signed net excess stall force in picoNewtons.",

            "introduction": "Once the \"tug-of-war\" is won and a cargo begins its journey, the type of motor dictates the travel time. Neurons employ a diverse fleet of motors, not a one-size-fits-all solution, with different families of kinesin and dynein exhibiting distinct speeds and force-generating capacities. This practice explores the functional consequences of this diversity by comparing the delivery times of two different kinesin motors, prompting a deeper analysis of the trade-offs between speed, reliability, and energy use that govern motor selection for different cellular tasks .",

            "problem": "A spherical cargo bound to a single anterograde motor travels along axonal microtubules from the soma to a synaptic terminal located at a distance of $1.00\\,\\text{cm}$. The cargo is transported either by a kinesin-3 family motor (e.g., KIF1A) with measured steady-state velocity $2\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}$ or by a kinesin-1 family motor (e.g., KIF5) with measured steady-state velocity $0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}$.

In your reasoning, discuss the mechanistic trade-offs between faster versus slower anterograde transport in terms of speed, processivity, load tolerance, and energy use per delivered distance.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the calculation of transport times for two different kinesin motors and the ratio of these times. The motion is stipulated to be at a constant velocity, with no pauses or detours. The fundamental relationship governing this motion is the definition of average velocity, which for constant velocity $v$ over a distance $d$ simplifies to:\n$$d = v \\cdot t$$\nwhere $t$ is the time elapsed. The delivery time $t$ can therefore be calculated as:\n$$t = \\frac{d}{v}$$\n\nFirst, we must establish a consistent set of units. The distance $d$ is given as $1.00\\,\\text{cm}$, and the velocities are given in $\\mu\\text{m/s}$. We will convert the distance to micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) to match the velocity units.\n$$d = 1.00\\,\\text{cm} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{m}$$\nSince $1\\,\\text{m} = 10^6\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, the distance is:\n$$d = (1.00 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times 10^6\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n\nLet $v_3$ be the velocity of the kinesin-3 family motor and $v_1$ be the velocity of the kinesin-1 family motor. The given values are:\n$$v_3 = 2\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}$$\n$$v_1 = 0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}$$\n\nNow we can compute the delivery time for each motor.\nFor the kinesin-3 motor, the delivery time $t_3$ is:\n$$t_3 = \\frac{d}{v_3} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{2\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}} = 5000\\,\\text{s}$$\nFor the kinesin-1 motor, the delivery time $t_1$ is:\n$$t_1 = \\frac{d}{v_1} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}} = 12500\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nThe problem requires the ratio of the kinesin-1 delivery time to the kinesin-3 delivery time. Let this ratio be $R$.\n$$R = \\frac{t_1}{t_3}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for time, we find that the ratio is inversely proportional to the ratio of the velocities:\n$$R = \\frac{d/v_1}{d/v_3} = \\frac{v_3}{v_1}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the velocities:\n$$R = \\frac{2\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}}{0.8\\,\\mu\\text{m/s}} = 2.5$$\nThe problem specifies that the reported ratio should be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the ratio is $2.500$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to discuss the mechanistic trade-offs between faster (kinesin-3) and slower (kinesin-1) anterograde transport. These calculated times, $5000\\,\\text{s}$ (approximately $1.4$ hours) and $12500\\,\\text{s}$ (approximately $3.5$ hours), illustrate the significant time scales involved in axonal transport, even under idealized, continuous-motion conditions. The cell employs a diversity of motors to balance competing physiological demands.\n\n1.  **Speed vs. Reliability (Processivity)**:\n    *   **Speed**: Kinesin-3 (e.g., KIF1A) is one of the fastest known molecular motors. This high speed is critical for the rapid delivery of time-sensitive cargoes, such as synaptic vesicle precursors, which are needed to replenish synaptic components and sustain neuronal activity. The slower speed of kinesin-1 (e.g., KIF5) may be a disadvantage where rapid response is required.\n    *   **Processivity**: Processivity refers to a motor's ability to undergo many consecutive stepping cycles before detaching from its microtubule track. Kinesin-1 is a highly processive motor, often considered a \"workhorse\" for its reliable, long-distance transport. This high processivity minimizes the probability of cargo detachment mid-journey, which would delay or prevent delivery. While kinesin-3 is also processive, its specialization for speed may involve different mechanistic adaptations, and the canonical example of robust processivity remains kinesin-1. The trade-off is between getting there quickly (kinesin-3) and ensuring the cargo gets there reliably without detachment (a key feature of kinesin-1).\n\n2.  **Load Tolerance (Force Generation)**:\n    *   Molecular motors must work against the viscous drag of the cytoplasm and navigate a crowded cellular environment. Kinesin-1 motors are known for their ability to generate substantial force and often work in teams to transport large organelles like mitochondria. They exhibit high load tolerance, meaning their velocity and function are less impaired by opposing forces.\n    *   Kinesin-3 motors, conversely, are often monomeric in their inactive state and function as dimers for transport, typically carrying smaller cargoes. They are generally considered less powerful than kinesin-1 and are more sensitive to mechanical loads. Thus, the trade-off is speed for strength: kinesin-3 provides rapid transport for smaller, lighter cargoes, while kinesin-1 provides slower but more forceful transport for larger, heavier cargoes.\n\n3.  **Energy Use (ATP Hydrolysis)**:\n    *   Both kinesin-1 and kinesin-3 are ATPases, hydrolyzing one molecule of ATP per mechanical step along the microtubule. The step size for both motors is approximately $8\\,\\text{nm}$, corresponding to the length of a tubulin dimer.\n    *   Therefore, the energy cost *per unit distance* (e.g., ATP molecules hydrolyzed per micrometer of transport) is fundamentally similar for both motors: approximately $1\\,\\text{ATP} / 8\\,\\text{nm}$. There is no significant trade-off in terms of energy efficiency over a given distance.\n    *   However, the energy cost *per unit time* (i.e., power) is directly related to velocity. The faster kinesin-3 motor hydrolyzes ATP at a higher rate than the slower kinesin-1 motor to sustain its greater speed. The trade-off, then, is not in overall energy cost for a delivery, but in the instantaneous power demand placed on the cell's metabolic resources. Fast transport requires a higher rate of energy supply.\n\nIn summary, the neuron utilizes a diverse fleet of molecular motors, with faster, less forceful motors like kinesin-3 specialized for rapid delivery of small cargoes, and slower, more powerful motors like kinesin-1 acting as robust transporters for larger cargoes, ensuring reliable delivery over long distances.",
