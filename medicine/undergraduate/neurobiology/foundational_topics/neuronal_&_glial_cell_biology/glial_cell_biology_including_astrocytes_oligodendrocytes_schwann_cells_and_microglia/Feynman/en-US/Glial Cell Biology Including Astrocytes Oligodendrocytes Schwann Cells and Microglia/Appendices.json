            "introduction": "Myelination is a cornerstone of vertebrate nervous system evolution, enabling rapid signal transmission over long distances. The efficiency of this process depends critically on the thickness of the myelin sheath relative to the axon's diameter, a relationship quantified by the g-ratio, $g = d_{a} / d_{\\text{fiber}}$. This practice problem allows you to connect the microscopic structure of myelin—the number of times a glial cell wraps an axon—to this crucial physiological parameter, providing a concrete understanding of how myelin's geometry is optimized for function .",

            "problem": "Oligodendrocytes in the Central Nervous System (CNS) form myelin by wrapping multiple concentric lamellae around an axon. The g-ratio is defined as $g = d_{a} / d_{\\text{fiber}}$, where $d_{a}$ is the axon diameter and $d_{\\text{fiber}}$ is the total diameter of the myelinated fiber (axon plus myelin). Empirically, conduction velocity is optimized near $g \\approx 0.6$ to $g \\approx 0.8$. Consider an axon with diameter $d_{a} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and a myelin lamella thickness $t = 10\\,\\text{nm}$. Model the myelin sheath as $N$ concentric wraps, each contributing a uniform radial thickness $t$, with negligible periaxonal space and no gaps between lamellae. Using geometric reasoning based on these definitions, determine the smallest integer number of wraps $N$ that achieves a target g-ratio $g = 0.7$. Express your final answer as a single number with no units. No rounding by significant figures is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the smallest integer number of myelin wraps, $N$, needed to achieve a target g-ratio, $g$, for a given axon. The validation of the problem statement confirms its scientific soundness, consistency, and well-posed nature. We may therefore proceed with a quantitative solution.\n\nThe g-ratio is defined as the ratio of the axon diameter, $d_{a}$, to the total myelinated fiber diameter, $d_{\\text{fiber}}$:\n$$g = \\frac{d_{a}}{d_{\\text{fiber}}}$$\nThe givens are:\n- Axon diameter, $d_{a} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- Myelin lamella thickness, $t = 10\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- Target g-ratio, $g_{\\text{target}} = 0.7$.\n\nThe model assumes the myelin sheath consists of $N$ concentric wraps, each of thickness $t$. The total thickness of the myelin sheath, denoted $M$, is the product of the number of wraps and the thickness of each wrap. As the sheath surrounds the axon, its thickness is added to the axon radius on both sides to determine the total fiber diameter.\nThe total myelin thickness on one side of the axon is:\n$$M = N \\times t$$\nThe total fiber diameter, $d_{\\text{fiber}}$, is the sum of the axon diameter and twice the myelin sheath thickness (once for each side of the axon's cross-section):\n$$d_{\\text{fiber}} = d_{a} + 2M = d_{a} + 2Nt$$\nSubstituting this expression for $d_{\\text{fiber}}$ into the g-ratio formula yields:\n$$g = \\frac{d_{a}}{d_{a} + 2Nt}$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer $N$ that achieves a target g-ratio of $g = 0.7$. As the number of wraps $N$ increases, the myelin sheath becomes thicker, $d_{\\text{fiber}}$ increases, and consequently the g-ratio $g$ decreases. Therefore, \"achieving\" the target ratio means reaching a g-ratio that is less than or equal to the target value. We must find the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$g \\le g_{\\text{target}}$$\n$$\\frac{d_{a}}{d_{a} + 2Nt} \\le 0.7$$\nBefore solving for $N$, it is imperative to ensure dimensional consistency. The axon diameter is given in micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) and the lamella thickness is in nanometers ($\\text{nm}$). We will convert all length units to nanometers.\n- $d_{a} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{nm} = 1000\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- $t = 10\\,\\text{nm}$.\n\nSubstituting these numerical values into the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1000}{1000 + 2N(10)} \\le 0.7$$\n$$\\frac{1000}{1000 + 20N} \\le 0.7$$\nSince $N$ must be a non-negative integer, the denominator $(1000 + 20N)$ is strictly positive. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by the denominator without reversing the inequality sign:\n$$1000 \\le 0.7 \\times (1000 + 20N)$$\n$$1000 \\le 700 + 14N$$\nTo isolate $N$, we subtract $700$ from both sides:\n$$1000 - 700 \\le 14N$$\n$$300 \\le 14N$$\nFinally, we divide by $14$:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{300}{14}$$\n$$N \\ge \\frac{150}{7}$$\nTo find the numerical value:\n$$N \\ge 21.42857...$$\nThe number of wraps, $N$, must be an integer. The smallest integer value of $N$ that satisfies this condition is the next integer greater than $21.42857...$.\n$$N_{\\text{min}} = 22$$\nTo verify, for $N=21$, the g-ratio would be $g = \\frac{1000}{1000 + 20(21)} = \\frac{1000}{1420} \\approx 0.704$, which is greater than $0.7$. For $N=22$, the g-ratio is $g = \\frac{1000}{1000 + 20(22)} = \\frac{1000}{1440} \\approx 0.694$, which is less than $0.7$. Thus, $N=22$ is indeed the smallest integer number of wraps to achieve the target g-ratio.",

By slowing action potential conduction, the loss of myelin disrupts the precise timing required for complex neural computations.

            "problem": "A retinal ganglion cell axon in the human optic nerve is myelinated by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). In healthy myelinated axons, saltatory conduction arises because myelin increases membrane resistance and decreases membrane capacitance, shaping current flow between nodes of Ranvier. Demyelination caused by oligodendrocyte dysfunction removes this myelin, converting conduction to a slower, continuous mode that requires charging more membrane capacitance and incurs greater leak, thereby reducing conduction velocity. Consider an optic nerve segment of length $2\\,\\text{cm}$ where the local conduction velocity falls from $20\\,\\text{m/s}$ (healthy, myelinated) to $2\\,\\text{m/s}$ (demyelinated), while conduction elsewhere in the pathway remains unchanged. Using only the fundamental definition that velocity is the rate of change of position, derive from first principles the total conduction delay introduced by demyelination across this segment compared to the healthy case, and compute its numerical value. Express the final delay in seconds ($\\text{s}$) and round your answer to $3$ significant figures. After computing the delay, briefly interpret how such an added latency would impact temporal aspects of visual processing such as timing of the visual evoked potential and synchrony of feature integration.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\nThe explicit data and conditions provided in the problem statement are:\n-   A segment of a retinal ganglion cell axon has a length $L = 2\\,\\text{cm}$.\n-   The healthy, myelinated conduction velocity is $v_h = 20\\,\\text{m/s}$.\n-   The demyelinated conduction velocity is $v_d = 2\\,\\text{m/s}$.\n-   The derivation must use the fundamental definition that velocity is the rate of change of position.\n-   The final numerical answer for the delay must be computed, expressed in seconds ($\\text{s}$), and rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n-   A brief interpretation of the result's impact on visual processing is required.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is evaluated based on the established criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in fundamental principles of neurobiology and physics. The description of saltatory conduction, the roles of myelin and oligodendrocytes, and the consequences of demyelination (reduced conduction velocity) are factually correct. The provided numerical values for axon length and velocities are physiologically plausible for the human optic nerve.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It requests the calculation of a time difference based on a given distance and two distinct, constant velocities. The setup allows for a unique and meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a derivation from first principles. Let $x(t)$ represent the position of the action potential along the axon at time $t$. The instantaneous velocity, $v$, is defined as the derivative of position with respect to time:\n$$ v = \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nTo determine the total time, $T$, required for the action potential to traverse a segment of length $L$, we can rearrange and integrate this expression. Separating the variables yields:\n$$ dt = \\frac{1}{v} dx $$\nWe integrate this expression over the length of the axon segment, from an initial position $x=0$ to a final position $x=L$. The corresponding time interval is from $t=0$ to $t=T$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} dt = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{1}{v} dx $$\nFor both the healthy and demyelinated cases, the problem provides a single velocity value, implying that the velocity is constant along the entire $2\\,\\text{cm}$ segment. Therefore, the term $\\frac{1}{v}$ is a constant and can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ T [1]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{1}{v} \\int_{0}^{L} dx $$\n$$ T = \\frac{1}{v} [x]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{1}{v} (L - 0) = \\frac{L}{v} $$\nThis derivation from first principles confirms the standard kinematic formula relating time, distance, and constant velocity.\n\nWe now apply this result to calculate the conduction times for the healthy and demyelinated cases. The given parameters must be in consistent units. We convert the length $L$ to meters:\n$L = 2\\,\\text{cm} = 0.02\\,\\text{m}$.\nThe given velocities are $v_h = 20\\,\\text{m/s}$ (healthy) and $v_d = 2\\,\\text{m/s}$ (demyelinated).\n\nThe conduction time for the healthy, myelinated axon, $T_h$, is:\n$$ T_h = \\frac{L}{v_h} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{m}}{20\\,\\text{m/s}} = 0.001\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe conduction time for the demyelinated axon, $T_d$, is:\n$$ T_d = \\frac{L}{v_d} = \\frac{0.02\\,\\text{m}}{2\\,\\text{m/s}} = 0.01\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe conduction delay introduced by demyelination, $\\Delta T$, is the difference between these two times:\n$$ \\Delta T = T_d - T_h $$\nSubstituting the symbolic expressions:\n$$ \\Delta T = \\frac{L}{v_d} - \\frac{L}{v_h} = L \\left( \\frac{1}{v_d} - \\frac{1}{v_h} \\right) $$\nWe can now insert the numerical values to compute the delay:\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02\\,\\text{m} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\,\\text{m/s}} - \\frac{1}{20\\,\\text{m/s}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02 \\left( 0.5 - 0.05 \\right)\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.02 \\left( 0.45 \\right)\\,\\text{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta T = 0.009\\,\\text{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. To express $0.009$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.00900$.\nTherefore, the total conduction delay is $0.00900\\,\\text{s}$.\n\n**Interpretation of the Result**\nAn additional delay of $\\Delta T = 0.00900\\,\\text{s}$, or $9.00\\,\\text{ms}$, is highly significant in the context of neural processing, where timing is critical.\n$1$. **Impact on Visual Evoked Potential (VEP):** The VEP is an electrophysiological signal recorded from the scalp that reflects the processing of a visual stimulus by the brain. The latency of its components, such as the P100 wave which normally peaks around $100\\,\\text{ms}$ after the stimulus, is a direct measure of conduction time along the visual pathway. A delay of $9.00\\,\\text{ms}$ would cause a measurable and clinically significant increase in the P100 latency, a hallmark diagnostic criterion for demyelinating diseases affecting the optic nerve, like optic neuritis in multiple sclerosis.\n$2$. **Impact on Synchrony and Feature Integration:** Coherent visual perception requires the brain to bind together different features of an object (e.g., its color, shape, and motion), which are processed in parallel neural pathways. This \"binding\" process is thought to depend critically on the synchronous arrival of signals at higher-order cortical areas. If signals from one part of the visual field are delayed relative to others due to focal demyelination, this temporal synchrony is lost. This can impair complex visual functions, such as the perception of rapid motion and the correct integration of form and movement, leading to symptoms like blurred vision and difficulty tracking objects.",

The cell membrane is modeled as a collection of infinitesimally small membrane patches, each with area $dA$. The problem states that the conductances of these patches add in parallel.
