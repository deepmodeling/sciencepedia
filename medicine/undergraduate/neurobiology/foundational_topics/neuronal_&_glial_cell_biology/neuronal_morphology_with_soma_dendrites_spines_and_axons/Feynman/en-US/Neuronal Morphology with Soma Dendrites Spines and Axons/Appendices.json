The problem defines this quantity as the \"intersection-weighted average radial distance from the soma.\" This is a direct instruction to calculate a weighted average.\n\nLet the set of discrete radii be $\\{r_i\\}_{i=1}^k$ and the corresponding number of dendritic intersections be $\\{N_i\\}_{i=1}^k$, where $N_i = N(r_i)$. Here, $k=4$.

This is derived from the first principles of calculating the mean of a discrete weighted distribution.\nThe formula is:\n$$\n\\bar{r}_c = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} r_i N_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} N_i}\n$$\n\nFirst, we address step 1 of the problem: computing the Sholl profile $N(r)$ at the given radii.

It is a well-posed problem rooted in the classical principles of neurobiological cable theory, specifically addressing Rall's condition for impedance-matched branching in dendrites. The given parameters are scientifically realistic and sufficient to determine a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe central principle for solving this problem is the condition for impedance matching at a dendritic bifurcation. For a parent dendrite branching into two daughter dendrites, under the assumptions of classical cable theory (uniform specific membrane resistivity $R_{m}$ and internal resistivity $R_{i}$, and semi-infinite cable lengths), impedance matching occurs when the input conductance of the parent branch, $G_{p}$, is equal to the sum of the input conductances of the daughter branches, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. The problem explicitly states this condition as \"input conductances at the branch point combine additively.\"\n\n$$G_{p} = G_{1} + G_{2}$$\n\nThe input conductance, $G_{in}$, of a semi-infinite cylindrical cable is a function of its radius, $r$, and the material properties of the membrane and cytoplasm. The input resistance, $R_{in}$, is given by $R_{in} = \\sqrt{r_{a} r_{m}}$, where $r_{a}$ is the axial resistance per unit length and $r_{m}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length.\n\nFor a cylinder of radius $r$:\nThe axial resistance per unit length is $r_{a} = \\frac{R_{i}}{\\pi r^2}$.\nThe membrane resistance per unit length is $r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2 \\pi r}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $R_{in}$:\n$$R_{in} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{R_{i}}{\\pi r^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_{m}}{2 \\pi r}\\right)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{i} R_{m}}{2 \\pi^2 r^3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_{i} R_{m}}}{\\sqrt{2} \\pi r^{3/2}}$$\n\nThe input conductance is the reciprocal of the input resistance, $G_{in} = \\frac{1}{R_{in}}$:\n$$G_{in} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\pi r^{3/2}}{\\sqrt{R_{i} R_{m}}}$$\n\nSince $R_{m}$ and $R_{i}$ are assumed to be uniform across all branches, the input conductance of any branch is directly proportional to its radius raised to the power of $3/2$:\n$$G_{in} \\propto r^{3/2}$$\n\nLet $k$ be the constant of proportionality, $k = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} \\pi}{\\sqrt{R_{i} R_{m}}}$. The impedance matching condition $G_{p} = G_{1} + G_{2}$ can be written as:\n$$k \\cdot r_{p}^{3/2} = k \\cdot r_{1}^{3/2} + k \\cdot r_{2}^{3/2}$$\n\nThe constant $k$ cancels, yielding Rall's $3/2$ power rule for dendritic branching:\n$$r_{p}^{3/2} = r_{1}^{3/2} + r_{2}^{3/2}$$\n\nThe problem provides the radii for the parent branch, $r_{p} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, and the first daughter branch, $r_{1} = 0.7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

The overall approach consists of two main steps: first, determining the synaptic current injected into the dendrite, and second, determining how this current affects the membrane potential at the soma.\n\nThe current injected by the synapse into the dendrite, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is governed by Ohm's law. It is the product of the synaptic conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, and the driving force, which is the difference between the membrane potential at the synapse, $V_{\\mathrm{local}}$, and the synaptic reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$. The problem specifies that the analysis is in the subthreshold regime, which allows for a linear approximation where the local membrane potential is assumed to be approximately equal to the resting potential, $V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\approx V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$. This simplifies the expression for the synaptic current injected into the cell to:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}} (E_{\\mathrm{rev}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}})$$\nA positive current corresponds to an inflow of positive charge (depolarization), while a negative current corresponds to a net outflow of positive charge (hyperpolarization).\n\nThe change in membrane potential at the soma, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{soma}}$, due to a current $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ injected at a distance $d$ is given by $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{soma}} = I_{\\mathrm{inj}} \\cdot Z_{0,d}$, where $Z_{0,d}$ is the transfer resistance between the synaptic location (distance $d$) and the soma (distance $0$). For a passive, linear cable, the reciprocity theorem states that the transfer resistance is symmetrical, i.e., $Z_{0,d} = Z_{d,0}$.\n\nThe term $Z_{d,0}$ represents the voltage change at location $d$ in response to a unit of current injected at the soma. If a current $I_{\\mathrm{test}}$ is injected at the soma, the resulting somatic voltage change is, by definition of the somatic input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{soma}}$, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{soma}} = I_{\\mathrm{test}} R_{\\mathrm{soma}}$.
