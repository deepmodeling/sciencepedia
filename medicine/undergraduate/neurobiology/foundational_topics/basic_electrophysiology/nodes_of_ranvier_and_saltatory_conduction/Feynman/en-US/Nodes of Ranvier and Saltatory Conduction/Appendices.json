Neurobiologists use the g-ratio—the ratio of the inner axon diameter to the total outer diameter—as a key metric to assess the thickness of the myelin sheath.

            "problem": "Myelinated axons conduct action potentials via saltatory conduction, in which depolarization regenerates at discrete nodes of Ranvier while the internodal, myelinated segments support rapid passive spread. A well-tested biophysical observation is that the thickness of myelin, relative to the axon caliber, modulates conduction velocity by decreasing membrane capacitance and increasing membrane resistance, thereby optimizing the speed of the saltatory process. A standard geometric descriptor of myelination is the g-ratio, defined as the ratio of the inner axon diameter to the total fiber diameter. Specifically, if the inner axon diameter is $d$ and the total fiber diameter (axon plus myelin) is $D$, then the g-ratio $g$ is $g = d/D$. Empirical and theoretical studies of mammalian myelinated axons predict that conduction velocity is optimized when the g-ratio lies within an interval that we take here as $[0.6,\\,0.7]$. \n\nConsider a myelinated axon with inner axon diameter $d = 2.0$ micrometers and total fiber diameter $D = 3.2$ micrometers. Using the core definition of g-ratio $g = d/D$, first compute $g$. Then, to quantitatively assess how close this axon is to the predicted optimal range for conduction velocity, define the deviation function\n$$\\Delta(g) = \\max\\{0,\\, 0.6 - g,\\, g - 0.7\\},$$\nwhich returns the shortest distance of $g$ to the interval $[0.6,\\,0.7]$ (zero if $g$ lies inside the interval, a positive value otherwise). \n\nCompute $\\Delta(g)$ for this axon. Express your final answer as a unitless number. No rounding instruction applies unless necessary; report the exact value if it is exact.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of neurobiology, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, objective in its language, and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of a deviation function, $\\Delta(g)$, for a myelinated axon with specified dimensions. The solution proceeds in two steps: first, computing the g-ratio, $g$, and second, evaluating the deviation function $\\Delta(g)$ using this value.\n\nThe given parameters are:\nInner axon diameter, $d = 2.0$ micrometers.\nTotal fiber diameter, $D = 3.2$ micrometers.\n\nThe g-ratio, $g$, is defined as the ratio of the inner axon diameter to the total fiber diameter:\n$$g = \\frac{d}{D}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$g = \\frac{2.0}{3.2}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $10$ to remove the decimals:\n$$g = \\frac{20}{32}$$\nDividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $4$, we get:\n$$g = \\frac{5}{8}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$g = 0.625$$\nThe g-ratio for this axon is $0.625$. Since $d$ and $D$ have the same units (micrometers), the g-ratio is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nThe problem states that the optimal range for the g-ratio is the interval $[0.6, 0.7]$. The calculated value $g = 0.625$ falls within this interval, as $0.6 \\le 0.625 \\le 0.7$.\n\nNext, we must compute the deviation function $\\Delta(g)$, which is defined as:\n$$\\Delta(g) = \\max\\{0, 0.6 - g, g - 0.7\\}$$\nThis function calculates the shortest distance from the value $g$ to the interval $[0.6, 0.7]$.\n- If $g$ is within the interval $[0.6, 0.7]$, both $0.6 - g$ and $g - 0.7$ will be less than or equal to $0$. In this case, the maximum of the set $\\{0, 0.6 - g, g - 0.7\\}$ will be $0$.\n- If $g$ is less than $0.6$, then $0.6 - g$ will be positive, and $g - 0.7$ will be negative. The maximum will be $0.6 - g$, which is the distance from $g$ to the interval's left endpoint.\n- If $g$ is greater than $0.7$, then $g - 0.7$ will be positive, and $0.6 - g$ will be negative. The maximum will be $g - 0.7$, which is the distance from $g$ to the interval's right endpoint.\n\nWe substitute our calculated value $g = 0.625$ into the deviation function:\n$$\\Delta(0.625) = \\max\\{0, 0.6 - 0.625, 0.625 - 0.7\\}$$\nNow, we evaluate the arguments of the $\\max$ function:\nThe first argument is $0$.\nThe second argument is $0.6 - 0.625 = -0.025$.\nThe third argument is $0.625 - 0.7 = -0.075$.\n\nSo, we need to find the maximum of the set $\\{0, -0.025, -0.075\\}$.\n$$\\Delta(0.625) = \\max\\{0, -0.025, -0.075\\}$$\nThe largest value in this set is $0$.\n$$\\Delta(0.625) = 0$$\nThis result is consistent with the interpretation of the function, as the calculated g-ratio $g=0.625$ lies within the optimal interval $[0.6, 0.7]$, and thus its deviation from the interval is zero.",

The concepts of nodes of Ranvier, internodal passive current spread, and nodal latencies are fundamental principles. The model's simplification (e.g., treating the passive depolarization time as a single time constant $\\tau_p$ and keeping it constant even when length changes) is a modeling assumption for a tractable problem, not a violation of scientific law.
