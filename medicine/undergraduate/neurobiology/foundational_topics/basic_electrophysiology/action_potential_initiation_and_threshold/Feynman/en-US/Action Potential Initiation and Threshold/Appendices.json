            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All givens are extracted verbatim: a single-compartment, spatially isopotential neuron model with passive leak conductance ($g_L$) and membrane capacitance ($C_m$); total membrane current is the sum of capacitive ($I_C$) and ionic leak ($I_L$) currents; a long-duration constant injected current $I$ is applied; the leak is ohmic with reversal potential equal to the resting potential $V_{rest}$; input resistance is defined as $R_{in} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial I}\\right|_{\\text{steady}}$. The numerical values provided are $g_{L} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, $V_{rest} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $V_{\\theta} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The problem is scientifically sound as it is based on the standard passive membrane model (RC circuit), a fundamental concept in neurobiology. The definitions are standard, the parameters are realistic, and the question is well-posed, leading to a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe first step is to establish the governing differential equation for the membrane potential $V$ based on the principle of charge conservation. The total current crossing the membrane is the sum of the capacitive current, $I_C$, and the ionic leak current, $I_L$. This sum must be equal to the externally applied injected current, $I$.\n$$\nI = I_C + I_L\n$$\nThe capacitive current is defined by the relation $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$, where $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance and $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the membrane potential.\nThe ionic leak current, $I_L$, is given as ohmic with a conductance $g_L$ and a reversal potential equal to $V_{rest}$. Thus, its form is $I_L = g_L (V - V_{rest})$.\nSubstituting these expressions into the current balance equation yields the governing differential equation for the membrane potential:\n$$\nI = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_L (V - V_{rest})\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state membrane voltage, which we denote as $V_{ss}$. In the steady state, the membrane potential is constant, which implies that its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. Consequently, the capacitive current $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV}{dt}$ also becomes zero. The governing equation simplifies to:\n$$\nI = g_L (V_{ss} - V_{rest})\n$$\nWe can solve this algebraic equation for $V_{ss}$:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{rest} + \\frac{I}{g_L}\n$$\nNext, we must express this solution in terms of the input resistance, $R_{in}$, as defined in the problem statement: $R_{in} = \\left.\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial I}\\right|_{\\text{steady}}$. We apply this definition to our steady-state solution for $V$. The steady-state voltage is $V_{ss}$, so we compute the partial derivative of $V_{ss}$ with respect to $I$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I} \\left( V_{rest} + \\frac{I}{g_L} \\right)\n$$\nSince $V_{rest}$ and $g_L$ are constants with respect to the injected current $I$, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial I} = \\frac{1}{g_L}\n$$\nBy the definition given, this derivative is the input resistance $R_{in}$. Therefore, we have the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nR_{in} = \\frac{1}{g_L}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this back into the expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{rest} + I \\left(\\frac{1}{g_L}\\right) = V_{rest} + I R_{in}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the steady-state membrane voltage under constant current injection, expressed in terms of $V_{rest}$, $I$, and $R_{in}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the minimal constant current, $I_{min}$, required such that the steady-state voltage meets or exceeds a fixed threshold $V_{\\theta}$. This condition is $V_{ss} \\ge V_{\\theta}$. The minimum current corresponds to the case of equality:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $V_{ss}$ with $I = I_{min}$:\n$$\nV_{rest} + I_{min} R_{in} = V_{\\theta}\n$$\nSolving for $I_{min}$:\n$$\nI_{min} R_{in} = V_{\\theta} - V_{rest}\n$$\n$$\nI_{min} = \\frac{V_{\\theta} - V_{rest}}{R_{in}}\n$$\nSince $R_{in} = 1/g_L$, this can also be written as:\n$$\nI_{min} = (V_{\\theta} - V_{rest}) g_L\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $I_{min}$ using the provided parameters: $g_{L} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nS}$, $V_{rest} = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $V_{\\theta} = -50\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle governing the membrane potential ($V_m$) of a single-compartment neuron at steady state is the conservation of charge, expressed as a current balance equation. At steady state, the time derivative of the membrane potential is zero ($\\frac{dV_m}{dt} = 0$), which implies the capacitive current is zero. Therefore, the sum of all transmembrane ionic currents must be equal and opposite to the injected current.\n\nBy convention, outward ionic currents are positive. An injected current $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ that causes depolarization is considered positive. The current balance equation at steady state is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = \\sum_{k} I_k$$\nwhere $I_k$ represents each type of ionic current flowing out of the cell. In this model, the ionic currents are the leak current ($I_L$) and the GABAergic current ($I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$).\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = I_L + I_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$$\nEach ionic current is described by Ohm's law for a conductance-based model:\n$$I_k = g_k (V_m - E_k)$$\nwhere $g_k$ is the conductance and $E_k$ is the reversal potential for the $k$-th ion channel.\n\nApplying this to our specific currents:\n1.  Leak Current: $I_L = g_L (V_m - E_L)$\n2.  GABA Current: $I_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$\n\nSubstituting these into the current balance equation gives the steady-state current-voltage relationship for the neuron:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = g_L (V_m - E_L) + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$$\nThis equation explicitly accounts for the effects of the tonic GABA conductance. The term $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ adds to the total membrane conductance, thereby reducing the neuron's input resistance (this is known as shunting inhibition). The reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ influences the resting potential and the net current flow at any given $V_m$.\n\nTo determine the new resting potential, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}, new}$, we set $I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = 0$ and solve for $V_m$:\n$$0 = g_L (V_{\\mathrm{rest}, new} - E_L) + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} (V_{\\mathrm{rest}, new} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rest}, new} = \\frac{g_L E_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}}{g_L + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{rest}, new} = \\frac{(10 \\ \\mathrm{nS})(-70 \\ \\mathrm{mV}) + (5 \\ \\mathrm{nS})(-52 \\ \\mathrm{mV})}{10 \\ \\mathrm{nS} + 5 \\ \\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{-700 - 260}{15} \\ \\mathrm{mV} = \\frac{-960}{15} \\ \\mathrm{mV} = -64 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe tonic GABA conductance depolarizes the resting potential from $E_L = -70 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$ to $-64 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nThe problem requires finding the steady current $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ that brings the membrane potential to the action potential threshold, $V_{\\theta}$. This means we must find the value of $I_{\\mathrm{inj}}$ that results in a steady-state membrane potential of $V_m = V_{\\theta} = -50 \\ \\mathrm{mV}$. We substitute $V_m = V_{\\theta}$ into the primary current-voltage equation:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = g_L (V_{\\theta} - E_L) + g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} (V_{\\theta} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, ensuring consistent units (Siemens for conductance, Volts for potential, Amperes for current).\n- $g_{L} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nS} = 10 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}$\n- $E_{L} = -70 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.070 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $g_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = 5 \\ \\mathrm{nS} = 5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}$\n- $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = -52 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.052 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\theta} = -50 \\ \\mathrm{mV} = -0.050 \\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = (10 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}) \\times (-0.050 \\ \\mathrm{V} - (-0.070 \\ \\mathrm{V})) + (5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}) \\times (-0.050 \\ \\mathrm{V} - (-0.052 \\ \\mathrm{V}))$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = (10 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}) \\times (0.020 \\ \\mathrm{V}) + (5 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{S}) \\times (0.002 \\ \\mathrm{V})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = (200 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}) + (10 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = 210 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in picoamperes ($\\mathrm{pA}$), where $1 \\ \\mathrm{pA} = 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{A}$.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{inj}} = 210 \\ \\mathrm{pA}$$\nThe value $210$ has three significant figures ($2.10 \\times 10^{2}$), which satisfies the rounding requirement.",
