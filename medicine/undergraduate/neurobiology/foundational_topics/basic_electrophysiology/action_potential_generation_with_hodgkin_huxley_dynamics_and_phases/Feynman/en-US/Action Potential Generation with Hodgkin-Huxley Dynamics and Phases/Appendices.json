This fundamental practice uses dimensional analysis to verify that every term in the model's central equation—the capacitive current, the ionic currents, and any externally applied current—consistently represents a current density. By confirming this unit homogeneity, you will reinforce your understanding of the principle of charge conservation at the membrane and appreciate the model's solid grounding in biophysics .",

            "problem": "A classical single-compartment Hodgkin–Huxley membrane patch obeys current balance per unit area, where the capacitive term and the ionic terms are expressed as current densities. Let the membrane capacitance per unit area be denoted by $C_{m}$ with units of farads per square centimeter $(\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$, the maximum conductance per unit area for a generic ionic pathway by $\\bar{g}$ with units of siemens per square centimeter $(\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$, the transmembrane potential by $V$ with units of volts $(\\mathrm{V})$, the ionic reversal potential by $E$ with units of volts $(\\mathrm{V})$, time by $t$ with units of seconds $(\\mathrm{s})$, and any applied current density by $I$ with units of amperes per square centimeter $(\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2})$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a dimensional analysis of the terms in the current balance equation for a Hodgkin-Huxley style membrane model to verify their unit consistency. The fundamental principle being tested is that of dimensional homogeneity, which states that any physically meaningful equation must have the same units for all terms that are summed or equated. The governing equation for the membrane patch is of the form $I = C_{m}\\,\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t + \\sum_k I_k$, where the ionic currents $I_k$ are of the form $\\bar{g}_k(V-E_k)$. We must demonstrate that the applied current density $I$, the capacitive current density $C_{m}\\,\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t$, and any generic ionic current density $\\bar{g}\\,(V-E)$ all share the same physical dimensions. We will express this common unit in terms of the base SI units: kilogram ($\\mathrm{kg}$), meter ($\\mathrm{m}$), second ($\\mathrm{s}$), and ampere ($\\mathrm{A}$).\n\nLet $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$. The problem provides the following units and definitions:\n- $[C_{m}] = \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $[\\bar{g}] = \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- $[V] = [E] = \\mathrm{V}$\n- $[t] = \\mathrm{s}$\n- $[I] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$\n- Derived units: $1\\,\\mathrm{F} = 1\\,\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V}$, $1\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$\n- Base unit relation: $1\\,\\mathrm{C} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$\n- The base unit for length in the SI system is the meter ($\\mathrm{m}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$. Therefore, $1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2} = (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n\nWe will now analyze each term.\n\n1.  **Applied Current Density, $I$**:\n    The units of $I$ are given directly as amperes per square centimeter, $[I] = \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. To express this in base SI units, we convert the area from $\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n    $$ [I] = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} $$\n    Dimensionally, this is equivalent to $\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$. In terms of the specified base units, this is $\\mathrm{kg}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{A}^{1}$.\n\n2.  **Ionic Current Density, $\\bar{g}\\,(V-E)$**:\n    The units of this term are the product of the units of conductance density $\\bar{g}$ and potential difference $(V-E)$. Since $V$ and $E$ have the same units ($\\mathrm{V}$), their difference also has units of $\\mathrm{V}$.\n    $$ [\\bar{g}\\,(V-E)] = [\\bar{g}] \\cdot [V-E] = \\frac{\\mathrm{S}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\mathrm{V} $$\n    Using the definition $1\\,\\mathrm{S} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$, we substitute for the siemens unit:\n    $$ [\\bar{g}\\,(V-E)] = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} $$\n    This result, $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, is identical to the units of the applied current density $I$. Converting to base SI units yields $\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is $\\mathrm{kg}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{A}^{1}$.\n\n3.  **Capacitive Current Density, $C_{m}\\,\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t$**:\n    The units of this term are the product of the units of capacitance density $C_{m}$ and the rate of change of voltage $\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t$.\n    $$ [C_{m}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}] = [C_{m}] \\cdot [\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}} $$\n    Using the definition $1\\,\\mathrm{F} = 1\\,\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V}$, we substitute for the farad unit:\n    $$ [C_{m}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{C}}{\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{C}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} $$\n    Next, we use the relation $1\\,\\mathrm{C} = 1\\,\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$ to substitute for the coulomb unit:\n    $$ [C_{m}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}] = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}} $$\n    This result, $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$, is again identical to the units of $I$ and the ionic current density. Converting to base SI units yields $\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which is $\\mathrm{kg}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{0}\\,\\mathrm{A}^{1}$.\n\nThe dimensional analysis confirms that all three terms—$I$, $\\bar{g}\\,(V-E)$, and $C_{m}\\,\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}t$—possess the same units of current density, $\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. In the International System of Units (SI), this common unit is $\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nTo conclude, we express this unit as a function of the base units $\\mathrm{kg}$, $\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\mathrm{A}$. The unit is $\\mathrm{A}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, which can be written as $\\mathrm{kg}^{0}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{0}\\cdot\\mathrm{A}^{1}$. The problem asks for the tuple of exponents in the order $(\\mathrm{kg}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{s}, \\mathrm{A})$. These exponents are $0$, $-2$, $0$, and $1$.",

A fundamental property of such systems is that the state variables must be continuous functions of time, provided the inputs are not impulses.
