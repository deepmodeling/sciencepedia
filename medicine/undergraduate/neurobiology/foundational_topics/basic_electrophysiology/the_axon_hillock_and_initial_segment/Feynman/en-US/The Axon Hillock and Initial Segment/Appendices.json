            "problem": "A central feature of the axon hillock and axon initial segment (AIS) is the high density of voltage-gated sodium channels that underlies action potential initiation. Consider two neurons: an inhibitory interneuron and an excitatory pyramidal neuron. Both have axon initial segments (AIS) of equal diameter $d$ and are modeled as right circular cylindrical membrane segments with lateral surface area only (neglecting end caps). The measured AIS lengths are $L_{\\mathrm{int}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for the interneuron and $L_{\\mathrm{pyr}} = 40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ for the pyramidal neuron. Assume that voltage-gated sodium channel density over the AIS membrane, denoted $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ in $\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, is uniform along each AIS and equal across the two neuron types, and that the single-channel properties are the same in both cells. Let the total AIS sodium conductance be $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$.\n\nUsing only core definitions that connect conductance density and membrane area, and idealizing the AIS as described:\n- Derive a general expression for the ratio $R = \\dfrac{G_{\\mathrm{Na,pyr}}}{G_{\\mathrm{Na,int}}}$ in terms of $L_{\\mathrm{pyr}}$, $L_{\\mathrm{int}}$, and any shared geometric parameters.\n- Evaluate $R$ for the given AIS lengths.

Your final reported answer must be only the numerical value of $R$.",
            "solution": "The analysis of this problem begins with the fundamental relationship between total ionic conductance, conductance density, and membrane surface area. The total conductance, $G$, of a population of ion channels distributed over a membrane area $A$ is the product of the conductance density, $\\gamma$, and the area $A$. The problem specifies a uniform voltage-gated sodium channel conductance density, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, in units of $\\mathrm{S}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n\nThe relationship is expressed as:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times A$$\n\nThe axon initial segment (AIS) for both neurons is modeled as a right circular cylinder of diameter $d$ and length $L$. The problem specifies that only the lateral surface area is to be considered. The lateral surface area, $A$, of such a cylinder is given by:\n$$A = \\pi d L$$\n\nBy substituting the expression for the area $A$ into the equation for total conductance, we derive a general expression for the total sodium conductance $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ of an AIS:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\pi d L$$\n\nThis general expression can be applied to both the pyramidal neuron and the inhibitory interneuron. The problem states that the conductance density $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ and the AIS diameter $d$ are identical for both neuron types.\n\nFor the pyramidal neuron, with an AIS length of $L_{\\mathrm{pyr}}$, the total sodium conductance is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{Na,pyr}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\pi d L_{\\mathrm{pyr}}$$\n\nFor the inhibitory interneuron, with an AIS length of $L_{\\mathrm{int}}$, the total sodium conductance is:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{Na,int}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\pi d L_{\\mathrm{int}}$$\n\nThe aim is to find the ratio $R = \\dfrac{G_{\\mathrm{Na,pyr}}}{G_{\\mathrm{Na,int}}}$. We construct this ratio using the specific expressions for each neuron:\n$$R = \\frac{G_{\\mathrm{Na,pyr}}}{G_{\\mathrm{Na,int}}} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\pi d L_{\\mathrm{pyr}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\pi d L_{\\mathrm{int}}}$$\n\nThe terms common to both the numerator and the denominator, namely $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, $\\pi$, and $d$, cancel out. This simplification yields the general expression for the ratio $R$ purely in terms of the AIS lengths:\n$$R = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{pyr}}}{L_{\\mathrm{int}}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task, the derivation of the general expression for the ratio.\n\nNext, we evaluate this ratio using the specific lengths provided in the problem statement: $L_{\\mathrm{pyr}} = 40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{int}} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$R = \\frac{40\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 2$$\nThe ratio $R$ is a dimensionless quantity with a value of $2$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for a brief justification of which neuron would exhibit more robust action potential initiation. The initiation of an action potential depends critically on the regenerative influx of sodium ions ($\\mathrm{Na}^+$). The total inward sodium current, $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, that can be generated at the AIS is proportional to the total sodium conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$, as described by the relation $I_{\\mathrm{Na}} = G_{\\mathrm{Na}}(V_{\\mathrm{m}} - E_{\\mathrm{Na}})$, where $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the membrane potential and $E_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ is the Nernst equilibrium potential for sodium.\n\nOur calculation shows that $G_{\\mathrm{Na,pyr}} = 2 \\times G_{\\mathrm{Na,int}}$, meaning the pyramidal neuron's AIS has double the total sodium conductance of the interneuron's AIS. With all other properties being comparable, a larger $G_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ allows for a larger depolarizing current $I_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ to be generated in response to a threshold voltage stimulus. This larger current leads to a faster rate of depolarization ($dV_{\\mathrm{m}}/dt$) and a lower threshold for firing, factors that contribute to more robust and reliable action potential initiation. Therefore, the pyramidal neuron, possessing a longer AIS and thus a greater total sodium conductance, is expected to exhibit more robust action potential initiation.",

Express your final answer in $\\text{mV}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The solution is derived from two core biophysical principles: the equation for ionic current across a membrane and the linear current-voltage relationship for a patch of membrane (Ohm's law).\n\nFirst, we calculate the current flowing through the GABA-activated chloride channels, denoted as $I_{GABA}$. The current through a population of ion channels is given by the product of the total conductance ($g$) and the electrochemical driving force ($V_m - E_{ion}$), where $V_m$ is the membrane potential and $E_{ion}$ is the reversal potential for the specific ion.\n\nFor the chloride channels activated by GABA, this is:\n$$I_{GABA} = g_{GABA} (V_m - E_{Cl})$$\n\nThe driving force for chloride ions is $(V_m - E_{Cl})$. Given $V_m = -55\\,\\text{mV}$ and $E_{Cl} = -70\\,\\text{mV}$, the driving force is positive:\n$$V_m - E_{Cl} = -55\\,\\text{mV} - (-70\\,\\text{mV}) = 15\\,\\text{mV}$$\nSince chloride ions ($Cl^-$) are negatively charged, a positive driving force causes an influx of $Cl^-$ into the cell. By convention, electric current is the direction of positive charge flow. An influx of negative charge is equivalent to an outward current of positive charge. Thus, $I_{GABA}$ is an outward, hyperpolarizing current.\n\nLet's substitute the given values, converting them to base SI units for consistency:\n- Conductance: $g_{GABA} = 2\\,\\text{nS} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}$\n- Membrane potential: $V_m = -55\\,\\text{mV} = -0.055\\,\\text{V}$\n- Reversal potential: $E_{Cl} = -70\\,\\text{mV} = -0.070\\,\\text{V}$\n\nThe current $I_{GABA}$ is:\n$$I_{GABA} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}) \\times (-0.055\\,\\text{V} - (-0.070\\,\\text{V}))$$\n$$I_{GABA} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{S}) \\times (0.015\\,\\text{V})$$\n$$I_{GABA} = 3 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{A} = 30\\,\\text{pA}$$\n\nNext, we determine the effect of this current on the local membrane potential. The problem states that the AIS responds linearly with a local input resistance $R_{in}$. According to Ohm's law applied to the membrane, the change in membrane potential, $\\Delta V_m$, due to an injected current, $I_{inj}$, is $\\Delta V_m = I_{inj} \\times R_{in}$.\nThe outward membrane current $I_{GABA}$ has the same effect on the membrane potential as injecting a negative current of the same magnitude, i.e., $I_{inj} = -I_{GABA}$. Therefore, the resulting change in membrane potential is:\n$$\\Delta V_m = -I_{GABA} \\times R_{in}$$\n\nWe are given the input resistance $R_{in} = 100\\,\\text{M}\\Omega = 100 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega = 1 \\times 10^8\\,\\Omega$.\nSubstituting the values for $I_{GABA}$ and $R_{in}$:\n$$\\Delta V_m = -(3 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\text{A}) \\times (1 \\times 10^8\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$\\Delta V_m = -3 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V} = -3\\,\\text{mV}$$\n\nThis $\\Delta V_m = -3\\,\\text{mV}$ represents the hyperpolarization of the AIS membrane caused by the GABAergic inhibition. This is the \"inhibitory effect\" mentioned in the problem.\n\nFinally, the problem defines the \"change in the effective threshold\" as the additional depolarization required to counteract this inhibitory effect. To counteract a hyperpolarization of $-3\\,\\text{mV}$, an equal and opposite depolarization is needed. The magnitude of this required depolarization is therefore the magnitude of the calculated voltage change.\n\nMagnitude of change in effective threshold $= |\\Delta V_m| = |-3\\,\\text{mV}| = 3\\,\\text{mV}$.\n\nThe problem requests the answer to be expressed in $\\text{mV}$ and rounded to four significant figures.
