The problem states that the open probability of the channels is proportional to this activation variable.\n\nWe are given the following parameters for the two channel types:\nFor the T-type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC):\n$V_{1/2, T} = -60 \\text{ mV}$\n$k = 6 \\text{ mV}$\n\nFor the L-type Voltage-Gated Calcium Channel (VGCC):\n$V_{1/2, L} = -15 \\text{ mV}$\n$k = 6 \\text{ mV}$\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of open probabilities, $R$, at a specific membrane potential of $V = -50 \\text{ mV}$.

This is consistent with their physiological roles: T-type channels are low-voltage activated and contribute to calcium influx near the resting potential and during subthreshold depolarizations, whereas L-type channels are high-voltage activated and require stronger depolarization (e.g., during an action potential) to open significantly. At $-50 \\text{ mV}$, the neuron is significantly depolarized from a typical rest potential (e.g., $-70 \\text{ mV}$), which is sufficient to substantially activate T-type channels but is still far below the activation threshold for most L-type channels. Therefore, calcium entry at this potential would be overwhelmingly dominated by T-type channels, assuming channel numbers and single-channel conductances are comparable.",

It is based on the standard Hodgkin-Huxley formalism for describing voltage-gated ion channels. The parameters provided are physiologically realistic for T-type calcium channels. The concept of a window current arising from the overlap of activation and inactivation curves is a fundamental topic in neurophysiology. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free from ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nTo determine the membrane potential $V^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the T-type window current, we must find the maximum of the function representing the steady-state open probability, which is proportional to the window current.

Solving this equation for $V$ yields:\n$$V^{\\ast} \\approx -67.90~\\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $V^{\\ast} = -67.90~\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nFor the second part of the question, we must explain qualitatively how reaching $V^{\\ast}$ affects the membrane input resistance, $R_{in}$.\nThe input resistance of a neuron at a steady potential is the inverse of its total membrane conductance, $G_{total}$, at that potential: $R_{in} = 1/G_{total}$.\nThe total conductance is the sum of the leak conductance, $G_{leak}$, and the conductances of all active ion channels:\n$$G_{total}(V) = G_{leak} + \\sum_i g_i(V)$$\nwhere $g_i(V)$ is the conductance of the i-th type of ion channel. The conductance for a specific channel type is given by its maximal conductance, $\\bar{g}_i$, multiplied by its open probability, $P_{open,i}(V)$. For the T-type channels, the conductance is $G_{T-type}(V) = \\bar{g}_{T-type} \\cdot m_{\\infty}(V)h_{\\infty}(V)$.\nThe problem states that L-type channel activation is negligible near $V^{\\ast}$, so the dominant voltage-dependent conductance in this region is from the T-type channels.\n$$G_{total}(V) \\approx G_{leak} + G_{T-type}(V) = G_{leak} + \\bar{g}_{T-type} m_{\\infty}(V)h_{\\infty}(V)$$\nWe determined that $V = V^{\\ast}$ is the potential that maximizes the product $m_{\\infty}(V)h_{\\infty}(V)$. Consequently, at $V^{\\ast}$, the T-type channel conductance, $G_{T-type}(V)$, is at its maximum value.\nThis maximization of $G_{T-type}$ leads to a local maximum in the total membrane conductance, $G_{total}$, assuming $\\bar{g}_{T-type}$ is non-zero.\nSince $R_{in} = 1/G_{total}$, a maximum in total conductance corresponds to a minimum in input resistance.\nTherefore, as the membrane potential approaches $V^{\\ast}$, the T-type channel conductance increases, causing the total membrane conductance to rise and the input resistance to decrease. At $V^{\\ast}$, the cell membrane is most \"leaky\" due to the T-type channels, resulting in the lowest input resistance in this voltage range.",
