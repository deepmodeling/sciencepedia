            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective problem in the field of neurobiology, suitable for a quantitative solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, and the membrane time constant, $\\tau$, for a passive cylindrical axon, followed by their numerical evaluation and a physiological interpretation.\n\nFirst, we must express the resistance and capacitance per unit length of the axon in terms of the given specific parameters. The axon is modeled as a cylinder of radius $a$.\n\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_a$, depends on the intracellular resistivity, $r_i$, and the cross-sectional area of the cytoplasm, $A = \\pi a^2$. The resistance of a conductor is given by resistivity times length divided by area. For a unit length ($L=1$), this becomes:\n$$r_a = \\frac{r_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\nThe units are resistance per length, for instance, $\\mathrm{\\Omega/cm}$.\n\nThe membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, depends on the specific membrane resistance, $R_m$ (units of $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot cm^2}$), and the membrane surface area per unit length, which is the circumference of the cylinder, $2\\pi a$. The specific resistance $R_m$ is the resistance of a unit area of the membrane. To find the resistance for a strip of membrane of unit length, we divide $R_m$ by the circumference:\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\nThe units are resistance times length, for instance, $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot cm}$.\n\nThe membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_m$, depends on the specific membrane capacitance, $C_m$ (units of $\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$), and the circumference, $2\\pi a$. The specific capacitance $C_m$ is the capacitance of a unit area of membrane. To find the capacitance of a strip of membrane of unit length, we multiply $C_m$ by the circumference:\n$$c_m = C_m \\cdot 2\\pi a$$\nThe units are capacitance per length, for instance, $\\mathrm{F/cm}$.\n\nAccording to standard passive cable theory, the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, is defined as:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_a$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (2\\pi a)}{r_i / (\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^2}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 r_i}}$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\lambda$ in terms of the given parameters.\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau$, is defined as the product of the membrane resistance and capacitance. For the parameters per unit length, this is:\n$$\\tau = r_m c_m$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $c_m$:\n$$\\tau = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}\\right) (C_m \\cdot 2\\pi a) = R_m C_m$$\nThis is the required expression for $\\tau$. Note that $\\tau$ is independent of the axon's geometry ($a$) and depends only on the intrinsic properties of the membrane itself.\n\nNext, we evaluate these quantities using the provided numerical values. We must first ensure all units are consistent. We will use the cgs system (centimeter, gram, second) as a base, with electrical units of Volts, Amperes, Ohms, and Farads.\n\nGiven values:\n$a = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$R_m = 1\\,\\mathrm{k\\Omega\\,cm^2} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}$\n$C_m = 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F/cm^2} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$\n$r_i = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm}$\n\nCalculation of $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = R_m C_m = (1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm^2}) = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F}$$\nSince the time constant of an RC circuit is $\\tau = RC$, the unit $\\mathrm{\\Omega \\cdot F}$ is equivalent to seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$).\n$$\\tau = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nTo three significant figures, this is $1.00\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nCalculation of $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1000\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^2}) \\cdot (0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm})}{2 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm})}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{500 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm^3}}{200\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega\\,cm}}} = \\sqrt{2.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}} = \\sqrt{2.5} \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{2.5} \\approx 1.5811388...$$\n$$\\lambda \\approx 1.5811 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.015811\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$). Since $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\\lambda \\approx 0.015811\\,\\mathrm{cm} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{mm/cm} = 0.15811\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\lambda \\approx 0.158\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFinally, the physiological meaning and effects of parameter changes:\n\nThe electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, represents the distance over which a steady-state, subthreshold voltage change across the membrane decays to $1/e$ (approximately $37.3\\%$) of its original value. It is a measure of how effectively a passive electrical signal propagates along the axon before it attenuates. A larger $\\lambda$ indicates that voltage spreads farther, facilitating the spatial summation of synaptic potentials and increasing the speed of action potential propagation in myelinated axons.\n\nThe membrane time constant, $\\tau$, characterizes the speed at which the membrane potential changes in response to an input current. It is the time required for the membrane potential to reach $(1 - 1/e)$ (approximately $63.2\\%$) of its final steady-state value after a step change in current. A shorter $\\tau$ allows for a faster response to stimuli and supports higher frequencies of action potential firing, while a longer $\\tau$ promotes the temporal summation of slow or repeated inputs.\n\nQualitative effects of changing parameters:\n- Increasing axon radius $a$: $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{a}$, so $\\lambda$ increases. $\\tau$ is independent of $a$. Larger axons have better passive current spread.\n- Increasing specific membrane resistance $R_m$: $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{R_m}$ and $\\tau \\propto R_m$. Both constants increase. A less \"leaky\" membrane improves voltage spread but slows the membrane's response time.\n- Increasing specific membrane capacitance $C_m$: $\\lambda$ is independent of $C_m$. $\\tau \\propto C_m$, so $\\tau$ increases. A higher capacitance means more charge must be moved to change the voltage, slowing the membrane's response.\n- Increasing intracellular resistivity $r_i$: $\\lambda \\propto 1/\\sqrt{r_i}$, so $\\lambda$ decreases. $\\tau$ is independent of $r_i$. A more resistive cytoplasm hinders current flow along the axon.\n\nMyelination involves wrapping the axon with insulating myelin sheaths. This process drastically increases the effective specific membrane resistance $R_m$ and decreases the effective specific membrane capacitance $C_m$ of the internodal regions. The increase in $R_m$ is much more significant than the decrease in $C_m$.\n- Effect on $\\lambda$: The large increase in $R_m$ leads to a very large increase in $\\lambda$. This allows the passive current generated at one node of Ranvier to spread much farther down the axon to depolarize the next node to threshold, which is the basis for rapid saltatory conduction.\n- Effect on $\\tau$: Myelination increases $R_m$ and decreases $C_m$. The time constant $\\tau = R_m C_m$ may not change as dramatically as $\\lambda$, and the decrease in $C_m$ helps to speed up the charging of the membrane. However, the dominant effect of myelination on propagation speed is the enormous increase in the length constant $\\lambda$.",

We can now calculate the nodal delay $t_{d}$.\n$$t_{d} = \\frac{t_{p}}{S} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{s}}{4.5931} \\approx 6.5317 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the delay in microseconds ($\\mu \\mathrm{s}$).\n$$t_{d} = (6.5317 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot (10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}/\\mathrm{s}) = 65.317 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the delay is $t_{d} = 65.3 \\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$.\n\nThe required ordered pair is $(S, t_{d})$.\n$S = 4.59$\n$t_{d} = 65.3$",
