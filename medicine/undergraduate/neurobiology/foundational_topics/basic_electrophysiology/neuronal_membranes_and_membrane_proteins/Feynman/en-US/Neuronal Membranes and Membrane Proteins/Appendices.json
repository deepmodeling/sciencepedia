            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism and biophysics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is free of any inconsistencies or ambiguities.\n\nWe begin by deriving the membrane capacitance per unit area, $C_m$. The neuronal membrane is modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor. Let the area of the capacitor plates be $A$ and the separation between them (the membrane thickness) be $d$. The space between the plates is filled with a dielectric material (the lipid bilayer) with absolute permittivity $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$. Let a charge $+Q$ be on one side of the membrane (e.g., the extracellular side) and $-Q$ on the other (intracellular side). The surface charge density is $\\sigma = Q/A$.\n\nWe apply Gauss's law for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$, which states that for any closed surface, $\\oint \\mathbf{D} \\cdot d\\mathbf{A} = Q_{free,enc}$, where $Q_{free,enc}$ is the total free charge enclosed. We construct a cylindrical Gaussian surface (a \"pillbox\") that pierces one of the conductive surfaces and has one cap inside the conductor (where the field is zero) and the other cap inside the dielectric membrane. The area of the cap is $A_g$. Due to the planar symmetry, the displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is uniform and perpendicular to the membrane surface. Thus, the flux is non-zero only through the cap inside the dielectric. Gauss's law simplifies to $D A_g = \\sigma A_g$, which gives the magnitude of the displacement field as:\n$$\nD = \\sigma\n$$\nThe relationship between the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ and the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ in a linear, isotropic dielectric material is given by the constitutive relation $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$. Therefore, the magnitude of the electric field within the membrane is constant and given by:\n$$\nE = \\frac{D}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe potential difference $V$ across the membrane is the integral of the electric field across the thickness $d$:\n$$\nV = \\int_{0}^{d} E \\, dz = E \\cdot d = \\frac{\\sigma d}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma = Q/A$, we get:\n$$\nV = \\frac{(Q/A)d}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{Qd}{A\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe capacitance $C$ is defined as $C = Q/V$. Rearranging the above equation to solve for $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{Q}{V} = \\frac{A\\epsilon}{d}\n$$\nThe membrane capacitance per unit area, $C_m$, is defined as $C/A$. Dividing the expression for $C$ by the area $A$, we obtain the desired formula:\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{C}{A} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{d}\n$$\nThe absolute permittivity $\\epsilon$ is given by $\\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0$. So, the formula becomes:\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{\\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0}{d}\n$$\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $C_m$ using the provided data:\nMembrane thickness, $d = 4 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nRelative permittivity, $\\epsilon_r = 2$.\nPermittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $C_m$:\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{2 \\times (8.85 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m})}{4 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{17.7 \\times 10^{-12}}{4 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2} = 4.425 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}\n$$\nThe problem requires $C_m$ to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{F/cm^2}$. We perform the unit conversion, noting that $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, and thus $1\\ \\mathrm{m^2} = (100\\ \\mathrm{cm})^2 = 10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}$.\n$$\nC_m = 4.425 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m^2}} \\times \\left(\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m}}{10^2\\ \\mathrm{cm}}\\right)^2 = 4.425 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{\\mathrm{m^2}} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{m^2}}{10^4\\ \\mathrm{cm^2}} = 4.425 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm^2}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless ratio $R$, which compares our calculated value of $C_m$ to the canonical value of $1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm^2}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{C_m}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm^2}} = \\frac{4.425 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm^2}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm^2}}\n$$\n$$\nR = 0.4425\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The magnitude of an equilibrium potential, as given by the Nernst equation, is principally determined by the valence of the ion ($z_i$) and the logarithm of its concentration ratio across the membrane. The magnitude of $E_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is large because it is proportional to the logarithm of the concentration ratio $([\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{out}} / [\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]_{\\mathrm{in}})$, which for calcium is exceptionally large (on the order of $10^4$) compared to the ratios for typical monovalent ions such as $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ or $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$.",
