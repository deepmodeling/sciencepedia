            "problem": "A neuron behaves passively over small voltage excursions around rest, so graded synaptic potentials add linearly when they occur within the membrane time window that allows their peaks to coincide at the soma. Consider a cortical pyramidal neuron with resting membrane potential $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}=-68.3\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and action potential threshold at the axon initial segment $\\theta=-49.1\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. A single excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from an identical proximal synapse produces a peak depolarization at the soma of $A_{\\mathrm{EPSP}}=0.62\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ when evoked at rest.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of identical, simultaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), denoted by $N$, required to depolarize a neuron from its resting membrane potential to its action potential threshold.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe given parameters are:\n- Resting membrane potential: $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = -68.3\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Action potential threshold: $\\theta = -49.1\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n- Peak depolarization from a single EPSP: $A_{\\mathrm{EPSP}} = 0.62\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\nThe problem is based on the principle of linear summation of graded potentials, a standard and fundamental concept in neurobiology. The provided values are physiologically realistic for a cortical neuron. The assumptions of linearity, synchrony, and invariant EPSP amplitude are explicitly stated simplifications that render the problem well-posed and solvable. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains all necessary information. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe can now proceed with the solution.\nThe total amount of depolarization required for the neuron's membrane potential to reach the threshold $\\theta$ starting from the resting potential $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ is the difference between these two values. Let us denote this required voltage change as $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{threshold}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = \\theta - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{threshold}} = (-49.1\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-68.3\\,\\mathrm{mV}) = -49.1\\,\\mathrm{mV} + 68.3\\,\\mathrm{mV} = 19.2\\,\\mathrm{mV}\n$$\nThe problem states that the EPSPs are identical and occur simultaneously, allowing their peak amplitudes to sum linearly at the soma.

The smallest integer greater than or equal to $30.9677...$ is $31$.

            "problem": "A single-compartment neuron is modeled as a passive, isopotential membrane with membrane capacitance $C_m$, leak conductance $g_L$, and resting potential $E_L$. Synaptic currents obey Ohm’s law, where the current through a conductance $g$ with reversal potential $E$ is given by $I = g \\,(V_m - E)$, with $V_m$ the membrane potential. Kirchhoff’s current law states that the algebraic sum of currents at a node is zero, so the membrane current balance is constrained by the sum of capacitive and resistive currents equaling the externally applied and synaptic currents. The driving force is defined as the difference between the membrane potential and a channel’s reversal potential, i.e., $V_m - E$.\n\nTwo alternative inhibitory synapse models are considered:\n- Current-based inhibitory synapse: the synapse is represented as an injected current $I_{inh}(t)$ that does not depend on $V_m$.\n- Conductance-based inhibitory synapse: the synapse is represented as a time-varying conductance $g_{inh}(t)$ with reversal potential $E_{inh}$, so the inhibitory synaptic current is $I_{inh}(t) = g_{inh}(t)\\,(V_m - E_{inh})$.\n\nAn excitatory drive is represented as a constant current $I_{exc}$.\n\nConsider the following parameter values:\n- $C_m = 200$ pF,\n- $g_L = 10$ nS,\n- $E_L = -65$ mV,\n- $I_{exc} = 20$ pA.\n\nCompare the following two inhibitory cases applied together with the excitatory drive:\n- Case $1$ (current-based inhibition): $I_{inh} = -10$ pA, constant in time.\n- Case $2$ (conductance-based inhibition): $g_{inh} = 20$ nS, constant in time, with $E_{inh} = -65$ mV.\n\nAssume the neuron starts at rest and all inputs are maintained long enough to reach the steady state. Using only the definitions above (Kirchhoff’s current law, Ohm’s law, and the definition of driving force), select all statements that are correct about the distinction between current-based and conductance-based synaptic models and why conductance-based models are necessary to capture shunting effects:\n\nA. In Case $1$, because $I_{inh}$ is independent of $V_m$, the inhibitory current does not depend on driving force and cannot alter the neuron’s input resistance $R_{in}$; therefore inhibition cannot produce shunting of $I_{exc}$.\n\nB.

In Case 1, because $I_{inh}$ is independent of $V_m$, the inhibitory current does not depend on driving force and cannot alter the neuron’s input resistance $R_{in}$; therefore inhibition cannot produce shunting of $I_{exc}$.**\n- The premises are correct: the current-based injection $I_{inh}$ is defined to be independent of $V_m$ and thus independent of the driving force $V_m - E$.\n- The input resistance $R_{in}$ is the inverse of the total membrane conductance, $R_{in} = 1/g_{tot}$. In Case $1$, the model adds a current source but does not add any conductance, so $g_{tot} = g_L$ and $R_{in}$ is unaltered.\n- \"Shunting\" refers to the process by which an increase in membrane conductance provides a \"shunt\" for current, thereby reducing the voltage response to a given current input ($\\Delta V = I R_{in}$). Since $R_{in}$ is not reduced in Case $1$, this model cannot produce shunting. The inhibition is purely subtractive.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In Case 2, because $g_{inh}$ increases the total membrane conductance and $E_{inh} = E_L$, the inhibitory synapse reduces both the steady-state depolarization due to $I_{exc}$ and the membrane time constant $\\tau$, even though it injects no net current at rest; this is the essence of shunting inhibition.**\n- The opening of inhibitory channels, represented by $g_{inh}$, increases the total membrane conductance from $g_L$ to $g_L + g_{inh}$. This is correct.\n- With $E_{inh} = E_L$, if the neuron is at rest ($V_m = E_L$), the inhibitory current $I_{inh} = g_{inh}(V_m - E_{inh}) = g_{inh}(E_L - E_L) = 0$. So, it injects no current at rest. This is correct.\n- The steady-state depolarization due to $I_{exc}$ is $\\Delta V = I_{exc} / g_{tot}$. Since $g_{tot}$ increases, $\\Delta V$ decreases (from $2 \\text{ mV}$ to $\\approx 0.67 \\text{ mV}$). This is correct.\n- The membrane time constant is $\\tau_m = C_m / g_{tot}$. Since $g_{tot}$ increases, $\\tau_m$ decreases. The baseline $\\tau_m$ is $200 \\text{ pF} / 10 \\text{ nS} = 20 \\text{ ms}$. In Case $2$, $\\tau_m = 200 \\text{ pF} / 30 \\text{ nS} \\approx 6.67 \\text{ ms}$. This is correct.\n- This entire description—an increase in conductance that reduces input resistance and time constant, thereby diminishing the effect of other inputs without necessarily causing hyperpolarization—is the precise definition of shunting inhibition.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The steady-state depolarization from $E_L$ with $I_{exc}$ alone is approximately $2$ mV; with Case $1$ it becomes approximately $1$ mV; with Case $2$ it becomes approximately $0.67$ mV.**\n- Our calculations confirm these values precisely.\n- With $I_{exc}$ alone: $\\Delta V = 2 \\text{ mV}$.\n- With Case $1$: $\\Delta V = 1 \\text{ mV}$.\n- With Case $2$: $\\Delta V = 2/3 \\text{ mV} \\approx 0.67 \\text{ mV}$.\nThe statement is a factual summary of the results derived from the model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Shunting requires that $E_{inh}$ be far below $E_L$ so that the inhibitory synapse can directly hyperpolarize the membrane; otherwise no reduction of excitatory depolarization occurs.**\n- This statement claims shunting requires hyperpolarization ($E_{inh} \\ll E_L$). Case $2$ provides a direct counterexample where shunting occurs with $E_{inh} = E_L$. The key mechanism of shunting is the increase in conductance ($g_{tot} \\uparrow$), leading to a decrease in input resistance ($R_{in} \\downarrow$), which in turn reduces the voltage change for a given current input ($\\Delta V \\downarrow = I R_{in} \\downarrow$).\n- The clause \"otherwise no reduction of excitatory depolarization occurs\" is demonstrably false. In Case $2$, where no hyperpolarizing current is generated at rest, the excitatory depolarization is reduced from $2 \\text{ mV}$ to $\\approx 0.67 \\text{ mV}$. This reduction is the shunting effect. While inhibition is often hyperpolarizing ($E_{inh}  E_L$), shunting itself does not require it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\nThe solution requires a multi-step calculation to trace the propagation and transformation of the voltage signal from the distal dendrite to the axon initial segment (AIS).\n\n**Step 1: Attenuation of the EPSP from the Synaptic Site to the Soma**\nThe voltage attenuation along a passive cable is described by the steady-state cable equation, which, for a signal propagating from its origin, is given by:\n$$V(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $V_0$ is the initial voltage change at the origin ($x=0$), $\\lambda$ is the spatial length constant of the cable, and $V(x)$ is the voltage at a distance $x$ from the origin.\n\nFor the dendritic segment, the initial voltage is $V_{\\text{syn}} = 5.0$ mV, the distance to the soma is $x_{\\text{dend}} = 600$ $\\mu$m, and the dendritic length constant is $\\lambda_{\\text{dend}} = 250$ $\\mu$m. The voltage arriving at the soma, before considering the effect of the inhibitory synapse, which we denote as $V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} = V_{\\text{syn}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{\\text{dend}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{dend}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{x_{\\text{dend}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{dend}}} = \\frac{600 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}}{250 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}} = 2.4$$\n$$V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} = (5.0 \\text{ mV}) \\exp(-2.4)$$\n\n**Step 2: Effect of Shunting Inhibition at the Soma**\nThe arriving EPSP drives a synaptic current that depolarizes the soma. In the absence of inhibition, this current, $I_{\\text{syn, eff}}$, flows through the somatic leak resistance $R_{\\text{in}} = 1/g_L$ to produce the voltage $V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}$. According to Ohm's law:\n$$I_{\\text{syn, eff}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}}}{R_{\\text{in}}} = V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot g_L$$\nThe problem states that a co-active shunting inhibitory synapse adds a conductance $g_{\\text{inh}} = 20$ nS at the soma. Since it is a shunting synapse, its reversal potential is at the resting potential, so it only adds conductance without driving current itself. The new total somatic conductance, $g_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the leak conductance and the inhibitory conductance:\n$$g_{\\text{total}} = g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}$$\nThe same effective synaptic current $I_{\\text{syn, eff}}$ now flows through this larger total conductance, resulting in a smaller peak voltage at the soma, $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{syn, eff}}}{g_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot g_L}{g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}}$$\nThis equation shows that the shunting inhibition acts as a voltage divider, scaling the preshunt voltage by the factor $g_L / (g_L + g_{\\text{inh}})$.\nSubstituting the given conductance values ($g_L = 10 \\text{ nS}$, $g_{\\text{inh}} = 20 \\text{ nS}$):\n$$\\frac{g_L}{g_L + g_{\\text{inh}}} = \\frac{10 \\text{ nS}}{10 \\text{ nS} + 20 \\text{ nS}} = \\frac{10}{30} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nTherefore, the voltage at the soma in the presence of shunting inhibition is:\n$$V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}} = V_{\\text{soma, pre-shunt}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} (5.0 \\text{ mV}) \\exp(-2.4)$$\n\n**Step 3: Attenuation from the Soma to the AIS**\nThis somatic voltage, $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$, then propagates passively down the axon to the AIS. We apply the cable equation again, this time using the axonal parameters. The starting voltage is $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$, the distance is $x_{\\text{axon}} = 40$ $\\mu$m, and the axonal length constant is $\\lambda_{\\text{axon}} = 200$ $\\mu$m. The peak voltage at the AIS, $V_{\\text{AIS, peak}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{AIS, peak}} = V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{\\text{axon}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{axon}}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{soma, post-shunt}}$ and the axonal parameters:\n$$V_{\\text{AIS, peak}} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} (5.0 \\text{ mV}) \\exp(-2.4) \\right] \\exp\\left(-\\frac{40 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}}{200 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{m}}\\right)$$\nThe axonal exponent is $\\frac{40}{200} = 0.2$. Combining the exponential terms:\n$$V_{\\text{AIS, peak}} = \\frac{5.0}{3} \\exp(-2.4 - 0.2) \\text{ mV} = \\frac{5.0}{3} \\exp(-2.6) \\text{ mV}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of the Threshold Margin**\nThe threshold margin, $\\Delta$, is defined as the difference between the peak AIS depolarization and the spike threshold, $V_{\\text{th}} = 15.0$ mV.\n$$\\Delta = V_{\\text{AIS, peak}} - V_{\\text{th}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{AIS, peak}}$ and the value for $V_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left(\\frac{5.0}{3} \\exp(-2.6) - 15.0\\right) \\text{ mV}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\exp(-2.6) \\approx 0.074273578 \\dots$$\n$$V_{\\text{AIS, peak}} \\approx \\frac{5.0}{3} \\times 0.074273578 \\dots \\approx 1.6666\\dots \\times 0.074273578 \\dots \\approx 0.12378929 \\dots \\text{ mV}$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx (0.12378929 \\dots - 15.0) \\text{ mV}$$\n$$\\Delta \\approx -14.8762107 \\dots \\text{ mV}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta \\approx -14.88 \\text{ mV}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the peak depolarization at the AIS is well below the threshold for firing an action potential.",
