This practice guides you through the process of calculating both the individual equilibrium potentials for the key players—potassium ($K^+$), sodium ($Na^+$), and chloride ($Cl^-$)—using the Nernst equation, and then integrating them to find the overall resting potential with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary physical constants, biological parameters, and boundary conditions are provided, and they are consistent with established principles of electrophysiology and physical chemistry. The data are physically realistic for a mammalian neuron. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a reasoned solution can be constructed.\n\nThe task is to derive the Nernst and Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equations and use them to compute the single-ion equilibrium potentials and the overall resting membrane potential, respectively.\n\n(i) Derivation of the Single-Ion Equilibrium Potential (Nernst Potential)\n\nThe movement of an ion across a permeable membrane is governed by its electrochemical potential, $\\tilde{\\mu}$. For an ionic species $s$, this potential is the sum of its chemical potential (related to concentration) and its electrical potential (related to charge in an electric field):\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_s = \\mu_s^0 + RT \\ln[s] + z_s F \\phi $$\nHere, $\\mu_s^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $[s]$ is the molar concentration of the ion, $z_s$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, and $\\phi$ is the local electric potential.\n\nAn equilibrium potential for a single ionic species, $E_s$, is the membrane potential at which there is no net flux of that ion across the membrane. This occurs when the electrochemical potential for the ion is the same on both sides of the membrane. Equating the electrochemical potential inside the cell (subscript $i$) with that outside the cell (subscript $o$):\n$$ \\tilde{\\mu}_{s,i} = \\tilde{\\mu}_{s,o} $$\n$$ \\mu_s^0 + RT \\ln[s]_i + z_s F \\phi_i = \\mu_s^0 + RT \\ln[s]_o + z_s F \\phi_o $$\nThe standard chemical potential term $\\mu_s^0$ cancels. Rearranging the terms to solve for the potential difference across the membrane, $V_m = \\phi_i - \\phi_o$, which at this specific equilibrium is the Nernst potential, $E_s$:\n$$ z_s F (\\phi_i - \\phi_o) = RT \\ln[s]_o - RT \\ln[s]_i $$\n$$ z_s F E_s = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{[s]_o}{[s]_i}\\right) $$\nThis yields the Nernst equation for the equilibrium potential of ion $s$:\n$$ E_s = \\frac{RT}{z_s F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[s]_o}{[s]_i}\\right) $$\n\nTo compute the potentials, we first calculate the pre-factor $\\frac{RT}{F}$ at $T = 310.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$ \\frac{RT}{F} = \\frac{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})(310.15\\,\\mathrm{K})}{96485\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} \\approx 0.02673\\,\\mathrm{V} = 26.73\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nUsing the given concentrations:\nFor potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$), with $z_{\\mathrm{K}} = +1$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{K}} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{F}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_o}{[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_i}\\right) = (26.73\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{4}{140}\\right) \\approx -95.02\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nFor sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), with $z_{\\mathrm{Na}} = +1$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Na}} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{F}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_o}{[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_i}\\right) = (26.73\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{145}{12}\\right) \\approx +66.61\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nFor chloride ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), with $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = -1$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\left(\\frac{RT}{-1 \\cdot F}\\right) \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_o}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_i}\\right) = -(26.73\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{110}{10}\\right) \\approx -64.10\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\n\n(ii) Derivation of the Steady-State Membrane Potential (Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation)\n\nWhen the membrane is permeable to multiple ions, the steady-state membrane potential $V_m$ is not an equilibrium potential. Instead, it is a steady state where the net electric current across the membrane is zero ($\\sum_s I_s = 0$), while individual ions may still have non-zero fluxes. The derivation starts from the Nernst-Planck equation for ionic flux, incorporating both diffusion and drift in an electric field. Under the constant-field approximation (the electric field is constant across the membrane), this equation can be integrated to yield an expression for the current $I_s$ carried by each ion $s$, known as the GHK current equation.\n\nFor a system with monovalent cations ($C_i^+$) and anions ($A_j^-$), the condition of zero total current, $\\sum_i I_{C_i^+} + \\sum_j I_{A_j^-} = 0$, can be solved for the steady-state potential $V_m$. This procedure, after algebraic manipulation, yields the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation. For the ions $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, all of which are monovalent ($|z| = 1$), the equation is:\n$$ V_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln \\left( \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_i}{P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_o} \\right) $$\nNote that for the anion ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), the intracellular and extracellular concentrations are inverted in the expression, a direct consequence of its negative valence.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $V_m$. The relative permeabilities $P_{\\mathrm{K}} : P_{\\mathrm{Na}} : P_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = 1.00 : 0.040 : 0.45$ can be used directly, as any scaling factor would cancel in the fraction. Let $P_{\\mathrm{K}}=1.00$, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}=0.040$, and $P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}=0.45$.\n\nWe compute the numerator of the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_o + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_i $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = (1.00)(4\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.040)(145\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.45)(10\\,\\mathrm{mM}) = 4 + 5.8 + 4.5 = 14.3\\,\\mathrm{mM} $$\n\nWe compute the denominator of the argument of the logarithm:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = P_{\\mathrm{K}}[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Na}}[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]_i + P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_o $$\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = (1.00)(140\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.040)(12\\,\\mathrm{mM}) + (0.45)(110\\,\\mathrm{mM}) = 140 + 0.48 + 49.5 = 189.98\\,\\mathrm{mM} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the GHK equation:\n$$ V_m = (26.7308\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{14.3}{189.98}\\right) $$\n$$ V_m = (26.7308\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\ln(0.075271) $$\n$$ V_m \\approx (26.7308\\,\\mathrm{mV}) (-2.5866) \\approx -69.136\\,\\mathrm{mV} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the resting membrane potential is $V_m = -69.14\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n\nInterpretation of Driving Forces:\nThe electrochemical driving force on an ion is the difference between the membrane potential and the ion's equilibrium potential, $(V_m - E_{ion})$.\n-   For $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$: Driving force = $(-69.14) - (-95.02) = +25.88\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The positive sign indicates an outward driving force, causing a passive efflux of $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ from the cell.\n-   For $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$: Driving force = $(-69.14) - (+66.61) = -135.75\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The large negative sign indicates a strong inward driving force, causing a passive influx of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ into the cell.\n-   For $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$: Driving force = $(-69.14) - (-64.10) = -5.04\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. The small negative sign indicates a weak inward driving force, causing a passive influx of $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ into the cell.\n\nAt the steady-state resting potential of $-69.14\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the small inward currents of $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ are balanced by an outward current of $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, such that the total net current is zero. The maintenance of these concentration gradients in the face of these passive fluxes requires active transport mechanisms, such as the $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}/\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ pump. The resting potential is closest to the Nernst potentials of the most permeable ions, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and furthest from that of the least permeable ion, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.",

Substituting $z=-1$ gives the Nernst potential for chloride, $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{(-1)F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) = -\\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we can write this as:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression used for computation.\n\n**2. Derivation of the GABAergic Synaptic Reversal Potential ($E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$)**\n\nThis task requires deriving the reversal potential for a membrane permeable to two monovalent anions, chloride ($\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) and bicarbonate ($\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}$), using the constant-field assumption. The reversal potential is the membrane potential at which the total net current carried by these ions is zero.\n\nThe Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation describes the current $I_S$ for an ionic species $S$ with valence $z_S$ and permeability $P_S$ under the constant-field assumption:\n$$\nI_S = P_S z_S^2 \\frac{F^2V_m}{RT} \\frac{[S]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [S]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{-z_S F V_m / RT}}{1 - e^{-z_S F V_m / RT}}\n$$\nFor a monovalent anion like $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ or $\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}$, the valence $z$ is $-1$. The current equation becomes:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{anion}} = P_{\\mathrm{anion}} (-1)^2 \\frac{F^2V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{anion}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{anion}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{-(-1) F V_m / RT}}{1 - e^{-(-1) F V_m / RT}} = P_{\\mathrm{anion}} \\frac{F^2V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{anion}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{anion}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{F V_m / RT}}{1 - e^{F V_m / RT}}\n$$\nThe reversal potential, $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$, is the membrane potential $V_m$ where the sum of currents from all permeable ions is zero.\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{total}} = I_{\\mathrm{Cl}} + I_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the GHK current expression for each ion:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Cl}} \\frac{F^2V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{F V_m / RT}}{1 - e^{F V_m / RT}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}} \\frac{F^2V_m}{RT} \\frac{[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{F V_m / RT}}{1 - e^{F V_m / RT}} = 0\n$$\nAt the reversal potential $V_m = E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} \\neq 0$, the common pre-factor $\\frac{F^2V_m}{RT(1 - e^{F V_m / RT})}$ is non-zero and can be cancelled.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\left([\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{F E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} / RT}\\right) + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}\\left([\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} - [\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} e^{F E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} / RT}\\right) = 0\n$$\nWe now solve for $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$. Group terms containing $e^{F E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} / RT}$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\left(P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}\\right) e^{F E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} / RT}\n$$\nIsolate the exponential term:\n$$\ne^{F E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} / RT} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and solving for $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ gives the GHK-like equation for anions:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{GABA}} = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the expression used for computation.\n\n**3. Derivation of the Small-Signal Postsynaptic Voltage Deflection ($\\Delta V$)**\n\nThis task requires expressing the initial voltage deflection caused by the activation of a synaptic conductance $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$. The \"small-signal, isopotential membrane approximation\" treats the neuron near rest as a simple resistor $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nThe current flowing through the open synaptic channels, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, is given by an ohmic relationship:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{syn}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V_m - E_{\\mathrm{syn}})\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the synaptic conductance, $V_m$ is the membrane potential, and $E_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ is the synaptic reversal potential, which is $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ in this case.\n\nAccording to the problem, we approximate the initial voltage deflection when the synapse opens while the neuron is at its resting potential, $V_m = V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$. The initial synaptic current is therefore:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{syn}, \\text{initial}} = g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}})\n$$\nBy convention, an outward flow of positive charge (or inward flow of negative charge) from the cell is a positive current and causes hyperpolarization (a negative change in $V_m$). This injected current flows across the cell's input resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The resulting voltage change, $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{final}} - V_{\\text{initial}}$, is given by Ohm's law applied to the cell, with a negative sign to account for the current convention:\n$$\n\\Delta V = -I_{\\mathrm{syn}, \\text{initial}} R_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the initial synaptic current:\n$$\n\\Delta V = -g_{\\mathrm{syn}}(V_{\\mathrm{rest}} - E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}) R_{\\mathrm{in}}\n$$\nDistributing the negative sign gives the final expression for the voltage deflection:\n$$\n\\Delta V = g_{\\text{syn}} R_{\\mathrm{in}} (E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}})\n$$\nThis formulation is a small-signal approximation, valid when the synaptic conductance is small compared to the cell's resting conductance ($g_{\\mathrm{syn}} \\ll 1/R_{\\mathrm{in}}$). The term $(E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}})$ is the effective driving force for the voltage change. The product $g_{\\mathrm{syn}} R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is a dimensionless factor. The units of $\\Delta V$ will be the same as the units used for $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$. We will perform calculations in millivolts.\n\n**Summary of Computational Formulae:**\n1.  $E_{\\mathrm{Cl}} [\\text{mV}] = 1000 \\times \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)$\n2.  $E_{\\mathrm{GABA}} [\\text{mV}] = 1000 \\times \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{in}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Cl}}[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}} + P_{\\mathrm{HCO_3}}[\\mathrm{HCO_3}^{-}]_{\\mathrm{out}}}\\right)$\n3.  $\\Delta V [\\text{mV}] = (g_{\\mathrm{syn}} R_{\\mathrm{in}}) (E_{\\mathrm{GABA}}[\\text{mV}] - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}[\\text{mV}])$",
