            "problem": "In the mammalian olfactory bulb glomerulus, many olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) converge onto the principal dendrites of a single mitral or tufted cell. Consider a brief, synchronous activation of ORN axon terminals onto one mitral cell. Assume the following fundamental principles: (i) the quantal model of synaptic transmission for independent release sites, where each of $N$ sites releases a single vesicle with probability $p_\\mathrm{release}$ and each vesicle produces a postsynaptic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) of quantal amplitude $q$, and (ii) a passive single-compartment neuron where the instantaneous change in membrane voltage follows Ohm’s law, so that an injected current $I$ produces an approximate voltage change $\\Delta V \\approx I R_\\mathrm{in}$ when the current is brief relative to the membrane time constant and the driving force does not change appreciably.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the expected excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) and the resulting membrane voltage change in a mitral cell, based on the principles of quantal synaptic transmission and a passive neuron model.\n\nFirst, we derive the expected peak EPSC amplitude, denoted as $\\mathbb{E}[I_\\mathrm{EPSC}]$. The problem states that there are $N$ independent synaptic release sites, and each site releases a vesicle with a probability $p_\\mathrm{release}$. This process can be modeled as a series of $N$ independent Bernoulli trials. The total number of vesicles released, let's call this random variable $k$, therefore follows a binomial distribution, $k \\sim B(N, p_\\mathrm{release})$.\n\nThe total current, $I_\\mathrm{EPSC}$, is the sum of the currents from each vesicle released.

It is valid to proceed with a solution.\n\nThe evolution of the membrane potential, $V(t)$, of a neuron modeled as a parallel resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit is described by the fundamental membrane equation. According to Kirchhoff's current law, the total input current $I$ is partitioned into a current through the membrane resistance ($I_R$) and a current through the membrane capacitance ($I_C$):\n$$I = I_R + I_C$$\nThe resistive current is given by Ohm's law, where the potential difference across the resistor is $V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$. Thus, $I_R = \\frac{V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_m}$. The capacitive current is defined by $I_C = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$. Substituting these into the current balance equation yields:\n$$I = \\frac{V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{R_m} + C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nThis is the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the membrane potential.
