            "problem": "In vertebrate rod photoreceptors, photon capture by rhodopsin produces an activated rhodopsin state, denoted $R^{\\ast}$, that catalytically activates the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein transducin (Gt). Activated transducin in turn activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-specific phosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6), which hydrolyzes Guanosine $3',5'$-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). Consider the following experimentally grounded facts about the cascade dynamics during the active lifetime of a single $R^{\\ast}$ in a rod:\n\n- During its active lifetime, a single $R^{\\ast}$ activates approximately $N_{T} = 100$ transducin molecules.\n- Each activated transducin produces one activated PDE6 catalytic unit, and each such activated PDE6 hydrolyzes cGMP at an average catalytic rate $k_{\\text{cat}} = 2000$ molecules per second per activated PDE6.\n- The $R^{\\ast}$ lifetime is $\\tau_{R} = 50\\,\\text{ms}$.\n\nAssume that the number of activated PDE6 catalytic units equals the number of activated transducin molecules and, for the purpose of estimation, that these PDE6 units are effectively active over the entire $R^{\\ast}$ lifetime $\\tau_{R}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of neurobiological signal transduction, is well-posed with all necessary data and simplifying assumptions provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total number of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) molecules hydrolyzed as a consequence of the activation of a single rhodopsin molecule, $R^{\\ast}$, over its active lifetime. The problem is approached by applying the fundamental definition provided: the total number of substrate molecules converted equals the product of the catalytic rate and the time of activity.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$ be the total number of cGMP molecules hydrolyzed. This quantity can be expressed as the product of the total rate of cGMP hydrolysis and the duration over which this hydrolysis occurs.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of active enzyme units. The problem states that a single $R^{\\ast}$ activates $N_{T}$ transducin molecules. It is also given that each activated transducin produces one activated phosphodiesterase (PDE6) catalytic unit. Therefore, the number of activated PDE6 units, which we can denote as $N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}}$, is equal to the number of activated transducin molecules, $N_{T}$.\n$$N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}} = N_{T}$$\nGiven the value $N_{T} = 100$, we have:\n$$N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}} = 100$$\n\nSecond, we determine the total catalytic rate of cGMP hydrolysis. The rate for a single activated PDE6 unit is given as $k_{\\text{cat}}$. With $N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}}$ active units acting in parallel, the total rate of hydrolysis, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the number of active units and the rate per unit.\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}$$\nSubstituting $N_{\\text{PDE}^{\\ast}} = N_T$, we get:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = N_{T} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}$$\n\nThird, we use the provided fundamental definition to calculate the total number of hydrolyzed molecules. The problem states to assume that the PDE6 units are active for a duration equal to the lifetime of $R^{\\ast}$, which is $\\tau_{R}$. Thus, the total number of cGMP molecules hydrolyzed, $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$, is the product of the total rate $V_{\\text{total}}$ and the duration $\\tau_{R}$.\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = V_{\\text{total}} \\times \\tau_{R}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\text{total}}$, we arrive at the general formula:\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (N_{T} \\times k_{\\text{cat}}) \\times \\tau_{R}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this equation. The given values are:\n-   Number of activated transducins, $N_{T} = 100$.\n-   Catalytic rate per PDE6, $k_{\\text{cat}} = 2000 \\text{ s}^{-1}$.\n-   Lifetime of $R^{\\ast}$, $\\tau_{R} = 50\\,\\text{ms}$.\n\nBefore performing the calculation, we must ensure consistency of units. The catalytic rate $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is given in units of inverse seconds ($\\text{s}^{-1}$), while the lifetime $\\tau_{R}$ is in milliseconds ($\\text{ms}$). We convert $\\tau_{R}$ to seconds:\n$$\\tau_{R} = 50\\,\\text{ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n\nWe can now calculate $N_{\\text{cGMP}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 100 \\times 2000\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 200000\\,\\text{s}^{-1} \\times 0.05\\,\\text{s}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (2 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-2})$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = (2 \\times 5) \\times 10^{5-2}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 10 \\times 10^{3}$$\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 10000$$\n\nThe result is $10000$ molecules. The problem requires this to be expressed in scientific notation and rounded to two significant figures.\n$$N_{\\text{cGMP}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4$$\nThis represents the total number of cGMP molecules hydrolyzed due to a single photon capture event, demonstrating the significant amplification inherent in the phototransduction cascade.",

Consider a simplified two-state model in which the channel is either closed or open, and opening is promoted by binding of $n$ cGMP molecules in a cooperative manner. Assume the following well-tested facts and definitions: (i) at thermodynamic equilibrium, the ratio of probabilities of two states is given by the Boltzmann factor of their free-energy difference; (ii) cooperative ligand control of a two-state output is often captured by the Hill-Langmuir formalism, in which the concentration-dependence of the effective opening equilibrium constant scales as a power law in ligand concentration; and (iii) the half-activation concentration $K_{1/2}$ is defined by the unique $c$ for which the open probability is $1/2$.\n\nStarting from these bases, derive an expression for the steady-state open probability $P_{o}(c)$ as a function of the cGMP concentration $c$, the Hill coefficient $n$, and the half-activation $K_{1/2}$, without assuming any specific shortcut formula for $P_{o}(c)$ in advance.

Consider a minimal stochastic model that captures multi-site phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) and Arr binding kinetics, focusing on how replacing G protein-coupled receptor kinase 1 (GRK1) with G protein-coupled receptor kinase 7 (GRK7) alters the expected recovery time of an individual opsin under saturating flash conditions.\n\nModel the number of phosphates on a single active opsin as a state variable $i \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,m\\}$, where $m$ is the total number of available phosphorylation sites.

Under a bright flash, GRK is not rate-limited by binding, and phosphorylation of any unoccupied site proceeds with a per-site rate constant $k_p$ (units $s^{-1}$).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The problem describes a simplified but biophysically plausible model of a key process in visual neuroscience, the deactivation of photo-excited opsin molecules. The model is cast as a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC), a standard and rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing such stochastic processes. The task is to calculate the mean first passage time to an absorbing state, which is a well-defined problem in the theory of stochastic processes. All parameters, rates, and initial conditions are specified unambiguously, allowing for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the expected recovery time, $E[T]$, of a single photo-activated opsin molecule. This process is modeled as a CTMC where the states, indexed by $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, represent the number of phosphates attached to the opsin. The process begins in state $i=0$ at time $t=0$.\n\nFrom any state $i < m$, the opsin can be further phosphorylated, transitioning to state $i+1$. This occurs with a rate $\\lambda_i = k_p(m-i)$. This rate is proportional to the number of available phosphorylation sites, $(m-i)$, consistent with the assumption that each site is phosphorylated independently with rate $k_p$.\n\nFrom any state $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, the opsin can bind an arrestin molecule and become inactive. This is an absorbing event, meaning the process terminates. This transition occurs with a rate $\\mu_i = k_{a0} \\exp(\\beta i)$. This exponential dependence captures the cooperative effect where existing phosphates on the opsin enhance the binding rate of arrestin.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the expected time to absorption, starting from state $i=0$. Let $E_i$ denote the expected time to be absorbed, given that the process starts in state $i$. Our goal is to compute $E_0$. We can derive a system of equations for the quantities $E_i$ using a first-step analysis.\n\nFor any state $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m\\}$, the process remains in this state for a random time that is exponentially distributed with a mean of $1/(\\lambda_i + \\mu_i)$, as the total rate of exiting state $i$ is $q_i = \\lambda_i + \\mu_i$. After this sojourn time, the process transitions to state $i+1$ with probability $p_{i \\to i+1} = \\lambda_i / q_i$ or to the absorbing arrestin-bound state with probability $p_{i \\to A} = \\mu_i / q_i$.\n\nThe expected time to absorption from state $i$, $E_i$, can be expressed as the sum of the expected time spent in state $i$ and the expected remaining time from the subsequent state. For $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, m-1\\}$, this leads to the following recurrence relation:\n$$ E_i = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_i + \\mu_i}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\lambda_i + \\mu_i}\\right)E_{i+1} + \\left(\\frac{\\mu_i}{\\lambda_i + \\mu_i}\\right) \\cdot 0 $$\nThe final term is zero because no further time accumulates after absorption. This equation simplifies to:\n$$ E_i = \\frac{1 + \\lambda_i E_{i+1}}{\\lambda_i + \\mu_i} $$\n\nWe must also define a boundary condition. For the state $i=m$, all phosphorylation sites are occupied, so the rate of further phosphorylation is $\\lambda_m = k_p(m-m) = 0$. The only possible exit from state $m$ is absorption, which occurs at rate $\\mu_m$. Therefore, the expected time to absorption from state $m$ is simply the mean of the exponential waiting time in this state, which is:\n$$ E_m = \\frac{1}{\\mu_m} = \\frac{1}{k_{a0} \\exp(\\beta m)} $$\n\nThis system of linear equations can be solved efficiently using backward substitution. The algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For a given set of parameters $(m, k_p, k_{a0}, \\beta)$, first compute the value of $E_m$.\n2.  Iterate backward from $i = m-1$ down to $i=0$, at each step calculating $E_i$ using the previously computed value of $E_{i+1}$ and the recurrence relation:\n    $$ E_i = \\frac{1 + k_p(m-i) E_{i+1}}{k_p(m-i) + k_{a0} \\exp(\\beta i)} $$\n3.  The final result is $E_0$, which gives the expected time in seconds.\n4.  This value is then converted to milliseconds by multiplying by $1000$ and rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the five test cases to obtain the final numerical answers.",
