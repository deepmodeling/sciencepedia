            "introduction": "This first practice introduces the fundamental equations governing gaze stability during head movement. By calculating the ideal eye velocity needed to track a moving target during head rotation, and the resulting error (retinal slip) from an imperfect reflex, you will develop a quantitative understanding of how the brain must coordinate eye and head movements to keep the world in focus. This scenario, where the head and target move together, is a classic example of VOR cancellation, a critical function for everyday tasks like looking at the speedometer while driving. ",

            "problem": "A head-imposed rotation engages the Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR), which produces an eye-in-head angular velocity opposing head motion. Consider a subject with the following rightward motions defined in the world frame: head angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ and target angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. Adopt the sign convention that rightward angular velocities are positive. Use the following fundamental definitions:\n\n- The gaze (eye-in-world) angular velocity is the sum of the eye-in-head and head-in-world angular velocities: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\n- The retinal slip is the target angular velocity relative to the gaze: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$.\n- Perfect fixation on the target requires $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0$.\n- The VOR generates an eye-in-head angular velocity opposing head motion that scales with the VOR gain $g$ as $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\n\nFirst, derive the eye-in-head angular velocity $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$ required for perfect fixation on this moving target during the given head rotation. Second, assuming the only active oculomotor contribution is the VOR with gain $g = 0.9$ (i.e., no smooth pursuit or other voluntary signals), predict the resulting retinal slip $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$.\n\nExpress both requested quantities in $\\mathrm{deg/s}$, with the sign indicating direction according to the stated convention. Provide exact values; no rounding is required. Report your final answer as two numbers in a single row matrix in the order $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$. Angle units are degrees per second.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities related to eye movements: first, the eye-in-head angular velocity required for perfect target fixation ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$), and second, the resulting retinal slip ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$) when the eye movement is driven solely by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). All angular velocities are given in $\\mathrm{deg/s}$, and the sign convention is that rightward motion is positive.\n\nThe given data and definitions are:\nHead-in-world angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nTarget-in-world angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nGaze angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\nRetinal slip angular velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$.\nCondition for perfect fixation: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0$.\nVOR eye velocity: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$.\nVOR gain for the second part of the problem: $g = 0.9$.\n\nFirst, we determine the required eye-in-head angular velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$, for perfect fixation. Perfect fixation requires the retinal slip to be zero:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 0 $$\nUsing the definition of retinal slip, we set it to zero to find the required gaze velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the gaze angular velocity must be equal to the target angular velocity:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} $$\nGiven $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$, the required gaze velocity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\nNow, we use the relationship between gaze, eye, and head velocities to solve for the required eye-in-head velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nRearranging for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nSubstituting the known values for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze,req}}$ (which is equal to $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}}$) and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} - 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe first required quantity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. This means that to perfectly track a target moving at the same angular velocity as the head, the eyes must remain stationary within the head (i.e., in their orbits). This scenario is known as VOR cancellation.\n\nSecond, we calculate the retinal slip, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$, under the assumption that the only active oculomotor contribution is the VOR with a gain $g = 0.9$. In this case, the actual eye-in-head velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}}$, is equal to the velocity generated by the VOR, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{VOR}} = -g\\,\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} $$\nUsing the given values $g = 0.9$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} = -(0.9) \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}) = -18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe negative sign indicates a leftward eye rotation, correctly opposing the rightward head rotation. Now, we calculate the actual resulting gaze velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$, using this eye velocity:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye}} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{head}} = -18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} + 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe gaze (eye in world) moves rightward at $2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. Finally, we can compute the retinal slip using its definition:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\omega_{\\mathrm{target}} - \\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}} $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\omega_{\\mathrm{target}}$ and the calculated $\\omega_{\\mathrm{gaze}}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} - 2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\nThe second required quantity is $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$. The positive value indicates that the target's image slips across the retina in the rightward direction, as the gaze velocity of $2\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$ is insufficient to keep up with the target's velocity of $20\\,\\mathrm{deg/s}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the two answers in order: $\\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}}$.\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{eye,req}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{slip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{deg/s} $$",

Immediately after a visually guided saccade to an eccentric target, the recorded horizontal eye position is $\\theta(t)$, with $\\theta(0)=\\theta_{0}$. In a healthy but slightly leaky integrator, the gaze-evoked drift is well approximated by first-order linear relaxational dynamics consistent with a leaky integrator: the time evolution of $\\theta(t)$ is governed by a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with a single real eigenvalue, and the solution exhibits exponential relaxation toward zero.

The system is modeled as a leaky neural integrator, whose dynamics are governed by a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.\n\nThe statement that the system exhibits \"exponential relaxation toward zero\" implies that the rate of change of the eye position, $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, is proportional to its current deviation from the center, $\\theta(t)$.
