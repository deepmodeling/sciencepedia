The application of these principles to model transport in a biological microenvironment like a taste pore is a standard and valid approach in biophysics and neurobiology.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It asks for a characteristic time scale derived from the governing equation and parameters, followed by a numerical calculation. The provided information is sufficient and consistent for these tasks. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. The parameters provided are scientifically plausible for the specified biological context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, for diffusion over a distance $L$. The process is governed by Fick's second law, which in one dimension is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 C(x,t)}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $C(x,t)$ is the concentration of the tastant at position $x$ and time $t$, and $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nTo find the characteristic time scale, we use dimensional analysis. The physical quantities involved have the following dimensions, where $[L]$ denotes length and $[T]$ denotes time:\n- Position $x$: $[x] = [L]$\n- Time $t$: $[t] = [T]$\n- Diffusion coefficient $D$: $[D] = [L]^2 [T]^{-1}$\n\nThe problem has a single characteristic length scale, the pore length $L$. We seek a characteristic time scale, $\\tau$, that can be constructed from $L$ and $D$. We propose a relationship of the form:\n$$\n\\tau \\propto L^a D^b\n$$\nwhere $a$ and $b$ are dimensionless exponents. To ensure dimensional consistency, the dimensions on both sides must match:\n$$\n[T] = ([L])^a ([L]^2 [T]^{-1})^b = [L]^{a+2b} [T]^{-b}\n$$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n- For time $[T]$: $1 = -b \\implies b = -1$\n- For length $[L]$: $0 = a+2b \\implies a = -2b = -2(-1) = 2$\n\nThus, the characteristic time scale must be proportional to $L^2/D$. By convention in such scaling arguments, the proportionality constant is taken to be of order unity. We define the characteristic time as:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{D}\n$$\nThis expression represents the typical time it takes for a particle to diffuse across a distance $L$.\n\nThe second step is to find an expression for the diffusion coefficient, $D$. The problem instructs us to use the Stokes-Einstein relation, which describes the diffusion of a spherical particle of radius $r$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ at absolute temperature $T$:\n$$\nD = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nCombining the two expressions, we obtain a formula for the characteristic time $\\tau$ in terms of the given physical parameters:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{L^2}{\\left( \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta r} \\right)} = \\frac{6 \\pi \\eta r L^2}{k_B T}\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the numerical value of $\\tau$.

The function is differentiable, and the steps required to reach the solution are logical and unambiguous.

It is free from subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the sensitivity $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$ and then calculate the ratio of sensitivities for Hill coefficients $n=2$ and $n=1$.\n\nFirst, we must find the derivative of the firing rate function $F(C)$ with respect to the concentration $C$. The function is:\n$$ F(C) = \\dfrac{F_{\\max} C^{n}}{K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}} $$\nWe use the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for a function $f(x) = \\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}$, its derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}$.\nLet $u(C) = F_{\\max} C^{n}$ and $v(C) = K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}$.\nThe derivatives of $u(C)$ and $v(C)$ with respect to $C$ are:\n$$ \\dfrac{du}{dC} = n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} $$\n$$ \\dfrac{dv}{dC} = n C^{n-1} $$\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{(n F_{\\max} C^{n-1})(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}) - (F_{\\max} C^{n})(n C^{n-1})}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nWe can simplify the numerator by factoring out the common term $n F_{\\max} C^{n-1}$:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} [(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n}) - C^{n}]}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nThe $C^n$ terms in the bracket cancel out:\n$$ \\dfrac{dF}{dC} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} C^{n-1} K_{d}^{n}}{(K_{d}^{n} + C^{n})^2} $$\nThis expression represents the slope of the dose-response curve at any concentration $C$.\n\nThe sensitivity at the threshold, $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$, is defined as this derivative evaluated at $C = K_{d}$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\left.\\dfrac{dF}{dC}\\right|_{C = K_{d}} = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} (K_{d})^{n-1} K_{d}^{n}}{(K_{d}^{n} + (K_{d})^{n})^2} $$\nNow we simplify this expression. In the numerator, we combine the powers of $K_{d}$:\n$$ (K_{d})^{n-1} K_{d}^{n} = K_{d}^{(n-1)+n} = K_{d}^{2n-1} $$\nIn the denominator, we combine the terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$ (K_{d}^{n} + K_{d}^{n})^2 = (2 K_{d}^{n})^2 = 4 (K_{d}^{n})^2 = 4 K_{d}^{2n} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max} K_{d}^{2n-1}}{4 K_{d}^{2n}} $$\nUsing the law of exponents $\\frac{a^x}{a^y} = a^{x-y}$, we simplify the $K_d$ terms:\n$$ \\dfrac{K_{d}^{2n-1}}{K_{d}^{2n}} = K_{d}^{(2n-1) - 2n} = K_{d}^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{K_{d}} $$\nThus, the final expression for the sensitivity at the threshold is:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n) = \\dfrac{n F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} $$\nThis shows that the sensitivity at $C=K_d$ is directly proportional to the Hill coefficient.\n\nNext, we must compute the multiplicative change in sensitivity when $n$ increases from $1$ to $2$. This is the ratio $\\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)}$.\nUsing our derived formula for $S_{\\mathrm{th}}(n)$:\nFor $n = 1$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1) = \\dfrac{(1) F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} = \\dfrac{F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} $$\nFor $n = 2$:\n$$ S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2) = \\dfrac{(2) F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}} = \\dfrac{F_{\\max}}{2 K_{d}} $$\nNow, we calculate the ratio:\n$$ \\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)} = \\dfrac{\\frac{F_{\\max}}{2 K_{d}}}{\\frac{F_{\\max}}{4 K_{d}}} $$\nThe constants $F_{\\max}$ and $K_{d}$ are fixed and non-zero, so they cancel out:\n$$ \\dfrac{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(2)}{S_{\\mathrm{th}}(1)} = \\dfrac{1/2}{1/4} = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\times \\dfrac{4}{1} = 2 $$\nThe multiplicative change in sensitivity is $2$.\n\nFinally, we provide a brief interpretation. The sensitivity, as the slope of the response curve, quantifies how much the neural firing rate changes for a small change in stimulus concentration. An increase in the Hill coefficient $n$ from $1$ to $2$ doubles this sensitivity at the detection threshold ($C=K_d$). This means that for a small change in sucrose concentration near $K_d$, the afferent nerve fibers will exhibit a twofold larger change in their firing rate. This amplified signal is then transmitted to the Nucleus of the Solitary Tract (NTS) and relayed to higher brain centers like the gustatory cortex. A larger neural signal difference for a given stimulus difference enhances the system's ability to discriminate between similar concentrations, making the system act more like a sharp, switch-like detector. Therefore, higher cooperativity ($n > 1$) in receptor activation leads to enhanced sensory discrimination near the threshold.",

The problem states that this parameter is unchanged (50 mM), but asks for its computation. This serves as a verification of the definition of $C_{50}$. By definition, $C_{50}$ is the concentration that produces a half-maximal response. For the post-drug condition, the maximal response is $R_{\\max,1} = 20$ spikes/s. The half-maximal response is therefore $\\frac{R_{\\max,1}}{2} = \\frac{20}{2} = 10$ spikes/s.

The solution is $C = 50$ mM. This calculation formally demonstrates, from the definition of $C_{50}$, that the post-drug value is indeed $C_{50,1} = 50$ mM.\nRounding this value to three significant figures gives $50.0$ mM.\n\nThe required final values are the fold-shift $\\alpha = 3.00$ and the post-drug concentration for half-maximal response $C_{50,1} = 50.0$ mM.",
