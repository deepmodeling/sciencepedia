Assume both media are homogeneous, isotropic, and lossless, and that the wave fields are time-harmonic. Using the boundary conditions of linear acoustics at a fluid–fluid interface (continuity of pressure and continuity of normal particle velocity) and the definition of specific acoustic impedance $Z$ for a plane wave in a lossless fluid, derive an expression for the reflectance $R$ (the ratio of reflected to incident intensity) at normal incidence in terms of the specific acoustic impedances $Z_1$ (air) and $Z_2$ (cochlear fluid).

            "problem": "A plane acoustic wave at the tympanic membrane produces a Sound Pressure Level (SPL) that drives the ossicular chain and displaces the stapes. In the low-frequency, quasi-static regime where inertial and viscous effects are negligible, model the stapes–annular ligament–cochlear input as a linear spring so that stapes displacement amplitude is proportional to the applied force and inversely proportional to the effective stiffness. Consider the stapedius reflex, which increases the effective stiffness of the middle ear transmission.\n\nAssume a free-field input of $90\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ Sound Pressure Level (SPL) at the tympanic membrane, an effective tympanic membrane area $A_{\\mathrm{TM}} = 55 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, and an ossicular lever ratio $r = 1.3$ that increases force at the stapes relative to the force on the tympanic membrane.

            "solution": "First, we determine the amplitude of the acoustic pressure at the tympanic membrane, $p_{\\mathrm{TM}}$, from the given Sound Pressure Level, $SPL_{\\mathrm{TM}}$. The standard definition of SPL in decibels is:\n$$SPL = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{p}{p_{0}}\\right)$$\nwhere $p$ is the root-mean-square pressure and $p_0$ is the reference pressure. For a sinusoidal wave, the amplitude is $\\sqrt{2}$ times the RMS value. However, in acoustics, it is common practice to use amplitude directly in this formula, and we will follow that convention as it does not affect the final ratio.

This force is the product of the pressure amplitude and the effective area of the tympanic membrane, $A_{\\mathrm{TM}} = 55 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{TM}} = p_{\\mathrm{TM}} \\times A_{\\mathrm{TM}} = (2 \\times 10^{-0.5}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}) \\times (55 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2})$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{TM}} = 110 \\times 10^{-6.5} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-4.5}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n\nThe ossicular chain acts as a lever, amplifying this force. The force at the stapes, $F_{\\mathrm{S}}$, is given by multiplying the tympanic membrane force by the ossicular lever ratio, $r = 1.3$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{S}} = F_{\\mathrm{TM}} \\times r = (1.1 \\times 10^{-4.5}) \\times 1.3 = 1.43 \\times 10^{-4.5}\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\n\nThe problem models the stapes-cochlea interface as a linear spring.
