            "solution": "The user has requested a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a detailed derivation and evaluation of the provided options for an electrophysiology experiment.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information and constraints:\n- **Experiment Type:** Whole-cell voltage clamp recording of glutamatergic synaptic currents from a hippocampal pyramidal neuron in an acute brain slice.\n- **Stimulation:** Schaffer collateral axon stimulation to evoke excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs).\n- **Objective:** To isolate currents carried by AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in separate recording conditions.\n- **Synaptic Current Equation:** $I_{\\text{syn}} = g_{\\text{syn}}\\,(V_m - E_{\\text{rev}})$, where $V_m$ is the holding potential, $g_{\\text{syn}}$ is synaptic conductance, and $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversal potential.\n- **Reversal Potential:** For glutamatergic synapses, $E_{\\text{rev}} \\approx 0\\ \\mathrm{mV}$.\n- **AMPAR Properties:**\n    - Rapid opening.\n    - No significant $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block at negative potentials.\n    - Largely voltage-independent conductance in the subthreshold range.\n- **NMDAR Properties:**\n    - Requires a co-agonist (glycine or D-serine).\n    - Exhibits voltage-dependent block by extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$.\n    - Strongly blocked at negative $V_m$.\n    - Unblocked at depolarized $V_m$.\n- **Standard ACSF Composition:** Contains approximately $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$.\n- **General Condition:** $\\gamma$-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA$_\\text{A}$) receptor-mediated inhibition is suppressed with a selective antagonist in all recordings.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the required criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the fundamental principles of synaptic electrophysiology. The descriptions of AMPAR and NMDAR properties, the use of voltage clamp, the synaptic current equation, the composition of ACSF, and the specified pharmacological agents (D-AP5, NBQX, gabazine) are all standard, factually correct, and central to the field of neurobiology.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines a goal (isolate AMPAR and NMDAR currents) and provides the necessary biophysical and pharmacological principles to logically deduce a correct experimental design. The question asks for a \"scientifically sound and internally consistent pair of protocols,\" which allows for a unique best answer to be identified from the options.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity, ambiguity, or opinion. All terms are standard within the discipline.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by deriving the principles for isolating each current type and then evaluating the given options.\n\n### Derivation of Correct Protocols\n\nThe total synaptic current, $I_{\\text{syn}}$, evoked by glutamate release is the sum of the currents through AMPARs and NMDARs: $I_{\\text{syn}} = I_{\\text{AMPAR}} + I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. To isolate one component, the other must be eliminated or minimized.\n\n**Isolation of AMPAR-mediated Current ($I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$):**\nTo measure $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$, we must eliminate $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. This can be achieved in two primary ways:\n\n1.  **Biophysical Isolation:** The most common method leverages the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block of NMDARs.\n    - In the presence of physiological extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ (e.g., $1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ as in standard ACSF), setting the holding potential $V_m$ to a negative value (e.g., $-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) will cause $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ions to enter and block the NMDAR pore.\n    - This drastically reduces NMDAR conductance ($g_{\\text{NMDAR}} \\to 0$), effectively silencing the NMDAR component of the current.\n    - AMPARs are not blocked under these conditions and will mediate an inward current, since $V_m (-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}) < E_{\\text{rev}} (0\\ \\mathrm{mV})$.\n    - Thus, the recorded current is almost purely $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$.\n\n2.  **Pharmacological Isolation:** Apply a selective NMDAR antagonist, such as D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5). This will block NMDARs regardless of the holding potential, leaving only $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$.\n\nThe first method is often preferred for its simplicity in separating the two components based on voltage alone.\n\n**Isolation of NMDAR-mediated Current ($I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$):**\nTo measure $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$, we must eliminate $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ and ensure conditions are permissive for NMDAR activation.\n\n1.  **Pharmacological Block of AMPARs:** $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ must be blocked using a selective AMPAR antagonist, such as 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) or a similar compound (e.g., CNQX). This sets $g_{\\text{AMPAR}}$ to $0$.\n\n2.  **Relief of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ Block:** To allow NMDARs to pass current, the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block must be removed. This is achieved by setting the holding potential $V_m$ to a positive, depolarized value (e.g., $+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$). At this potential, the positively charged $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ion is electrostatically repelled from the pore, allowing other cations to flow. The resulting current will be outward, as $V_m (+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}) > E_{\\text{rev}} (0\\ \\mathrm{mV})$.\n\n3.  **Co-agonist Requirement:** NMDARs require a co-agonist (glycine or D-serine). While endogenous levels may be present, adding a saturating concentration of a co-agonist (e.g., glycine at $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to the ACSF ensures that NMDAR activation is not limited by co-agonist availability, leading to a more robust and reliable measurement.\n\n**General Requirement:** Since recordings are made at both negative and positive potentials, and inhibitory currents can contaminate the recordings, blocking GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors with an antagonist like gabazine is crucial, especially at depolarized potentials where the driving force for $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$ is large. The problem statement correctly notes this is a general condition for all recordings.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and $2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, include gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to block GABA$_\\text{A}$ receptors; apply D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5) $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ as a control to confirm insensitivity to NMDAR blockade. NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, $2\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$, and glycine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$, include 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) $5\\text{–}10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to block AMPARs and gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** Holding at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in standard ACSF containing $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ correctly utilizes the voltage-dependent $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block to minimize $I_{\\text{NMDAR}}$. The inclusion of gabazine is appropriate. The mention of applying D-AP5 as a control is a correct description of a validation step, confirming the success of the biophysical isolation. This protocol is sound.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** Holding at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ correctly relieves the $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ block. Using NBQX correctly blocks $I_{\\text{AMPAR}}$. Adding glycine correctly ensures co-agonist saturation. Including gabazine correctly blocks inhibitory currents. This protocol is sound.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option presents the canonical, scientifically sound, and internally consistent pair of protocols for isolating AMPAR and NMDAR currents.\n\n**B. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF and add NBQX $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF with no AMPAR blocker.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is nonsensical. It proposes to measure AMPAR current while blocking AMPARs with NBQX. This would measure no AMPAR current.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol fails to isolate NMDARs. At $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and without an AMPAR blocker, the current would be heavily dominated by the fast, large AMPAR component. The removal of $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ would allow some NMDAR current to flow, but it would be mixed with, and much smaller than, the AMPAR current.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both protocols are fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF with gabazine $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ only; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ and add D-AP5 $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$ without any AMPAR blocker.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** The use of $0\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ ACSF is a critical error. Without extracellular $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, NMDARs are not blocked at negative potentials. Therefore, holding at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ would result in a mixed current of both AMPARs and NMDARs, failing the isolation objective.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is also incorrect. It proposes to isolate NMDAR current by adding D-AP5, which is an NMDAR *blocker*. This would eliminate the very current it aims to measure. The current recorded under these conditions (at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ with no AMPAR blocker) would be a pure AMPAR current.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Both protocols are fundamentally flawed and demonstrate a misunderstanding of the required conditions.\n\n**D. AMPAR isolation: hold at $V_m=+40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and add D-AP5 $50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$; NMDAR isolation: hold at $V_m=-70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in ACSF with $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$ and add NBQX $10\\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.**\n- **AMPAR isolation protocol:** This protocol *is* a valid way to isolate an AMPAR current. By pharmacologically blocking NMDARs with D-AP5, the remaining current at any voltage is purely from AMPARs. Measuring at $V_m = +40\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ would yield an outward AMPAR current.\n- **NMDAR isolation protocol:** This protocol is critically flawed. While it correctly blocks AMPARs with NBQX, it attempts to measure NMDAR current at $V_m = -70\\ \\mathrm{mV}$ in the presence of $1\\ \\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$. Under these conditions, the NMDARs are biophysically blocked by $\\mathrm{Mg^{2+}}$, so virtually no current would be recorded.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Because the pair of protocols must be internally consistent and sound, the failure of the NMDAR isolation protocol invalidates this option as a whole.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the fractional contributions of the AMPA and NMDA receptor components to the total charge transferred during an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). The total charge $Q$ is defined as the time integral of the current $I(t)$ from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I(t)\\,dt$$\nThe total current $I(t)$ is the sum of the AMPA and NMDA components, $I(t) = I_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}(t) + I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(t)$. By the linearity of the integral operator, the total charge $Q_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is the sum of the charges transferred by each component receptor:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (I_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}(t) + I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(t))\\,dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}(t)\\,dt + \\int_{0}^{\\infty} I_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(t)\\,dt = Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} + Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$$\nThe problem provides the functional forms for the currents for time $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}\\left(\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,AMPA}}}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r,AMPA}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}(t) = A_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}\\left(\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,NMDA}}}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{r,NMDA}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that for a decay time constant $\\tau_d$ greater than a rise time constant $\\tau_r$, the current $I(t)$ is unidirectional. For the given positive amplitude coefficients $A_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, this implies the currents are non-negative. The parameters satisfy this condition for both components (for AMPA, $3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} > 0.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$; for NMDA, $80.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} > 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$), because $\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,AMPA}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{r,AMPA}}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,NMDA}} > \\tau_{\\mathrm{r,NMDA}}$. Consequently, the instruction to use the magnitude of the current is satisfied by direct integration of the given functions, which are non-negative for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we find a general analytical formula for the charge $Q$ for a current of the form $I(t) = A\\left(\\exp(-t/\\tau_d) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_r)\\right)$.\n$$Q = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_r}\\right)\\right) dt$$\n$$Q = A \\left[ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_d}\\right) dt - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_r}\\right) dt \\right]$$\nWe use the standard definite integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-kt) dt = \\left[-\\frac{1}{k}\\exp(-kt)\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = 0 - (-\\frac{1}{k}) = \\frac{1}{k}$, which is valid for any positive constant $k>0$.\nBy applying this result to our integral with the substitutions $k = 1/\\tau_d$ and $k = 1/\\tau_r$, we obtain:\n$$Q = A \\left( \\tau_d - \\tau_r \\right)$$\nThis simple result demonstrates that the total charge is proportional to the amplitude coefficient and the difference between the decay and rise time constants.\n\nNow, we calculate the charge transferred by the AMPA receptors, $Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$, using the provided parameters: $A_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{r,AMPA}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,AMPA}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = A_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} (\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,AMPA}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{r,AMPA}}) = (120\\,\\mathrm{pA}) \\times (3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} - 0.4\\,\\mathrm{ms})$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = 120 \\times 2.6 \\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms} = 312\\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the charge transferred by the NMDA receptors, $Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$, using its parameters: $A_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{pA}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{r,NMDA}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,NMDA}} = 80.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = A_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} (\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,NMDA}} - \\tau_{\\mathrm{r,NMDA}}) = (40\\,\\mathrm{pA}) \\times (80.0\\,\\mathrm{ms} - 3.0\\,\\mathrm{ms})$$\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 40 \\times 77.0 \\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms} = 3080\\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms}$$\nThe unit of charge is the picoampere-millisecond ($\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms}$), which is equivalent to the femtocoulomb ($\\mathrm{fC}$), since $1\\,\\mathrm{pA} \\cdot 1\\,\\mathrm{ms} = (10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThe total charge transferred is the sum of the two components:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} + Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 312\\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms} + 3080\\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms} = 3392\\,\\mathrm{pA \\cdot ms}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required fractions, $f_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}$. These are unitless quantities.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{312}{3392}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{NMDA}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{3080}{3392}$$\n\nWe compute the numerical values and round them to four significant figures as requested.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = \\frac{312}{3392} \\approx 0.091981132...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $f_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} \\approx 0.09198$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = \\frac{3080}{3392} \\approx 0.908018867...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $f_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx 0.9080$.\n\nAs a consistency check, the sum of the rounded fractions is $f_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} + f_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} \\approx 0.09198 + 0.9080 = 0.99998$, which is consistent with the theoretical sum of $1$ given the independent rounding of each term. The results show that although the peak amplitude of the AMPA component current is significantly larger ($A_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} = 120\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ versus $A_{\\mathrm{NMDA}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{pA}$), the much slower kinetics of the NMDA component (specifically its long decay time constant $\\tau_{\\mathrm{d,NMDA}} = 80.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) cause it to dominate the total charge transfer, contributing over $90\\%$ of the total charge.",
