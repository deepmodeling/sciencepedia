The model assumptions are standard simplifications used in computational neuroscience:\n(i) $P_r \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}]^n$ is the classic power law model of calcium-dependent vesicle release.\n(ii) $[\\mathrm{Ca}] \\propto I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$ is a reasonable first-order approximation for the relationship between ion flux and local concentration.\n(iii) $IPSC \\propto P_r$ is definitional under conditions of constant quantal size and number of available vesicles.\nThe numerical values provided (a $30\\%$ reduction in $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current and a cooperativity of $n=4$) are biologically plausible. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet us denote the instantaneous vesicle release probability as $P_r$, the local presynaptic calcium concentration as $[\\mathrm{Ca}]$, the presynaptic calcium current as $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$, the inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude as $IPSC$, and the cooperativity of calcium binding as $n$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following proportionalities:\n1. $P_r \\propto [\\mathrm{Ca}]^n$\n2. $[\\mathrm{Ca}] \\propto I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$\n3. $IPSC \\propto P_r$\n\nWe can combine these relationships to find a direct proportionality between the observable $IPSC$ and the modulated variable $I_{\\mathrm{Ca}}$.\nSubstituting the second proportionality into the first, we get:\n$$P_r \\propto (I_{\\mathrm{Ca}})^n$$\nNow, substituting this result into the third proportionality, we obtain:\n$$IPSC \\propto (I_{\\mathrm{Ca}})^n$$\nThis relationship indicates that the $IPSC$ amplitude is proportional to the presynaptic calcium current raised to the power of the cooperativity factor, $n$.\n\nThis proportionality can be expressed as an equation with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$IPSC = k (I_{\\mathrm{Ca}})^n$$\nLet the baseline (control) state be denoted by the subscript 'base' and the state during DSI be denoted by the subscript 'DSI'. We can then write expressions for the $IPSC$ in both states:\n$$IPSC_{\\text{base}} = k (I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}})^n$$\n$$IPSC_{\\text{DSI}} = k (I_{\\mathrm{Ca, DSI}})^n$$\n\nTo determine the effect of the modulation, we can calculate the ratio of the $IPSC$ during DSI to the baseline $IPSC$:\n$$\\frac{IPSC_{\\text{DSI}}}{IPSC_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{k (I_{\\mathrm{Ca, DSI}})^n}{k (I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}})^n} = \\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{Ca, DSI}}}{I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}}}\\right)^n$$\nThe problem states that there is a CB1-mediated reduction of presynaptic $\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current by $30$ percent. This means the current during DSI is $70\\%$ of the baseline current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{Ca, DSI}} = I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}} - 0.30 \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}} = (1 - 0.30) \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}} = 0.70 \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}}$$\nTherefore, the ratio of the currents is:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{Ca, DSI}}}{I_{\\mathrm{Ca, base}}} = 0.70$$\nWe are given a cooperativity of $n = 4$. Substituting these values into the expression for the $IPSC$ ratio:\n$$\\frac{IPSC_{\\text{DSI}}}{IPSC_{\\text{base}}} = (0.70)^4$$\nCalculating this value:\n$$(0.70)^4 = 0.70 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.70 = 0.2401$$\nThis means the $IPSC$ amplitude during DSI is $24.01\\%$ of the baseline amplitude.\n\nThe question asks for the fractional reduction, which we denote as $F_R$. This is defined as the difference between the baseline and modulated values, divided by the baseline value:\n$$F_R = \\frac{IPSC_{\\text{base}} - IPSC_{\\text{DSI}}}{IPSC_{\\text{base}}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$F_R = 1 - \\frac{IPSC_{\\text{DSI}}}{IPSC_{\\text{base}}}$$\nSubstituting the value of the ratio we calculated:\n$$F_R = 1 - 0.2401 = 0.7599$$\nThis corresponds to a $75.99\\%$ reduction in the inhibitory postsynaptic current.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of synaptic physiology and biophysics, presenting a well-posed quantitative question with a self-contained and consistent set of definitions, assumptions, and data. The parameters provided are realistic, and the model described is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of paired-pulse plasticity.\n\nThe objective is to compute the change in the paired-pulse ratio, $\\Delta PPR = PPR' - PPR$, resulting from endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (eCB-LTD).\n\nLet us begin by formalizing the model of synaptic transmission. According to the quantal hypothesis provided, the amplitude of an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), $A$, is given by:\n$$A = N q p$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of functional presynaptic release sites, $q$ is the quantal size (the postsynaptic response to a single vesicle), and $p$ is the probability of release from any given site in response to an action potential.\n\nFor the first presynaptic pulse in the paired-pulse protocol, the EPSC amplitude, $A_1$, is:\n$$A_1 = N q p$$\nwhere $p$ is the baseline probability of release.\n\nFor the second pulse, we must account for two competing short-term plasticity mechanisms:\n$1$. **Vesicle Depletion**: The problem states that replenishment is negligible. Therefore, sites that released a vesicle on the first pulse are unavailable for the second. The number of sites that released is $Np$. The number of available sites for the second pulse is $N - Np = N(1-p)$.\n$2$. **Facilitation**: Residual calcium from the first pulse increases the release probability for the second pulse. The problem defines a facilitation factor $\\phi$ as a multiplicative increase in release probability. Thus, the release probability at an available site during the second pulse, $p_2$, is $p_2 = p(1+\\phi)$.\n\nCombining these effects, the amplitude of the second EPSC, $A_2$, is the product of the number of available sites, the quantal size, and the facilitated release probability:\n$$A_2 = [N(1-p)] \\times q \\times [p(1+\\phi)] = Nqp(1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\n\nThe paired-pulse ratio, $PPR$, is defined as the ratio of the second amplitude to the first:\n$$PPR = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{Nqp(1-p)(1+\\phi)}{Nqp} = (1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\n\nFirst, we determine the baseline release probability, $p$, using the provided experimental data. The baseline amplitudes are $A_1 = 200\\,\\mathrm{pA}$ and $A_2 = 240\\,\\mathrm{pA}$. The baseline $PPR$ is:\n$$PPR = \\frac{240\\,\\mathrm{pA}}{200\\,\\mathrm{pA}} = 1.2$$\nWe are also given the facilitation factor $\\phi = 0.5$. We can now solve for $p$:\n$$1.2 = (1-p)(1+0.5)$$\n$$1.2 = 1.5(1-p)$$\n$$1-p = \\frac{1.2}{1.5} = 0.8$$\n$$p = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\nThe initial probability of release is $p=0.2$.\n\nNext, we model the effect of eCB-LTD. This process reduces the presynaptic release probability by a multiplicative factor $r = 0.6$. The new release probability, $p'$, is:\n$$p' = r \\times p = 0.6 \\times 0.2 = 0.12$$\nThe problem states that eCB-LTD does not alter $N$, $q$, or the facilitation factor $\\phi$. Therefore, we can calculate the new paired-pulse ratio, $PPR'$, using the same formula with the new release probability $p'$:\n$$PPR' = (1-p')(1+\\phi)$$\n$$PPR' = (1 - 0.12)(1 + 0.5) = (0.88)(1.5) = 1.32$$\n\nFinally, we compute the change in the paired-pulse ratio, $\\Delta PPR$:\n$$\\Delta PPR = PPR' - PPR = 1.32 - 1.2 = 0.12$$\n\nAlternatively, we can derive a general expression for $\\Delta PPR$.\n$$\\Delta PPR = PPR' - PPR = (1-p')(1+\\phi) - (1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\nSubstituting $p' = rp$:\n$$\\Delta PPR = (1-rp)(1+\\phi) - (1-p)(1+\\phi)$$\n$$\\Delta PPR = (1+\\phi) \\times [(1-rp) - (1-p)]$$\n$$\\Delta PPR = (1+\\phi) \\times [p - rp] = p(1-r)(1+\\phi)$$\nUsing the previously calculated value of $p=0.2$ and the given values for $r$ and $\\phi$:\n$$\\Delta PPR = 0.2 \\times (1-0.6) \\times (1+0.5) = 0.2 \\times 0.4 \\times 1.5 = 0.08 \\times 1.5 = 0.12$$\nThis confirms the result.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta PPR = 0.120$$\n\nThe sign of $\\Delta PPR$ is positive, indicating that the paired-pulse ratio increases during eCB-LTD. This is a characteristic signature of a presynaptic locus of expression. A reduction in the initial release probability ($p$) lessens the degree of vesicle depletion on the first pulse (the term $1-p$ becomes larger), which causes the underlying facilitation to be more prominent in the paired-pulse interaction, thus increasing the $PPR$. A purely postsynaptic mechanism would affect $A_1$ and $A_2$ proportionally, resulting in no change to the $PPR$ ($\\Delta PPR = 0$).",
