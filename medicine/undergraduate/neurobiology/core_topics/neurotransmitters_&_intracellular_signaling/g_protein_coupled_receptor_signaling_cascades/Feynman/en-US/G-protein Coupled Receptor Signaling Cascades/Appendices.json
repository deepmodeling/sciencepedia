The $G\\alpha$ subunit is 'on' when bound to guanosine triphosphate ($GTP$) and 'off' when bound to guanosine diphosphate ($GDP$). Mastering this concept is the first step toward understanding the entire cascade. This exercise () presents a thought experiment involving a hypothetical neurotoxin that disrupts this fundamental on-off cycle, testing your qualitative understanding of how signal initiation and termination are controlled.",

            "problem": "A team of neurobiologists discovers a novel neurotoxin, which they name Persistotoxin, isolated from the venom of a rare deep-sea snail. Their initial studies reveal that Persistotoxin affects neuronal signaling pathways mediated by G-protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). Specifically, the toxin acts on the stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit ($G\\alpha_s$). The normal function of the $G\\alpha_s$ subunit, when activated, is to stimulate the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. Persistotoxin has been shown to irreversibly inhibit the intrinsic GTPase activity of the $G\\alpha_s$ subunit, preventing it from hydrolyzing its bound Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP) to Guanosine Diphosphate (GDP).\n\nAssuming a neuron is exposed to a saturating dose of Persistotoxin and then briefly stimulated by a neurotransmitter that activates the relevant GPCR, which of the following statements most accurately describes the primary and sustained consequence for the intracellular signaling cascade?\n\nA. The $G\\alpha_s$ subunit will fail to dissociate from the GPCR, preventing any downstream signal from being generated.\n\nB. The $G\\alpha_s$ subunit will remain permanently bound to adenylyl cyclase, leading to a persistent and abnormally high level of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).\n\nC. The $G\\beta\\gamma$ subunit complex will be unable to reassociate with the $G\\alpha_s$ subunit, causing it to activate other independent signaling pathways.\n\nD. Adenylyl cyclase will be immediately inhibited upon its first interaction with the toxin-modified $G\\alpha_s$ subunit, preventing the formation of cAMP.\n\nE. The neuron's membrane potential will rapidly hyperpolarize due to the direct action of the $G\\alpha_s$ subunit on ion channels.",
            "solution": "Normal $G_s$-coupled GPCR signaling proceeds as follows: in the resting state, the $G\\alpha_s$ subunit is GDP-bound and associated with $G\\beta\\gamma$. Upon neurotransmitter binding, the activated GPCR serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, promoting exchange of GDP for GTP on $G\\alpha_s$. The GTP-bound $G\\alpha_s$ dissociates from both the receptor and $G\\beta\\gamma$ and binds to and stimulates adenylyl cyclase, increasing intracellular cAMP. Termination of this signal requires the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G\\alpha_s$ to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, often accelerated by regulators of G-protein signaling; the GDP-bound $G\\alpha_s$ then reassociates with $G\\beta\\gamma$, turning off adenylyl cyclase.\n\nPersistotoxin irreversibly inhibits the intrinsic GTPase activity of $G\\alpha_s$, so after a brief neurotransmitter stimulus activates the GPCR and loads $G\\alpha_s$ with GTP, the $G\\alpha_s$ cannot hydrolyze GTP back to GDP. Consequently, $G\\alpha_s$ remains in its active, GTP-bound state, persistently dissociated from $G\\beta\\gamma$ and continuously stimulating adenylyl cyclase. The primary and sustained intracellular consequence is a prolonged, abnormally elevated cAMP level due to ongoing adenylyl cyclase activation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because $G\\alpha_s$ does dissociate from the GPCR upon GTP loading; the block is in hydrolysis, not dissociation.\n- B is correct in capturing the key sustained effect: persistent activation of adenylyl cyclase and elevated cAMP due to $G\\alpha_s$ remaining GTP-bound. Whether described as “permanently bound” or persistently activating, the net sustained outcome is abnormally high cAMP.\n- C, while the $G\\beta\\gamma$ complex would remain free as long as $G\\alpha_s$ is GTP-bound, the primary sustained effect emphasized in Gs signaling is persistent adenylyl cyclase activation and elevated cAMP, making B the most accurate primary consequence.\n- D is the opposite of what occurs; adenylyl cyclase is stimulated, not inhibited.\n- E is incorrect; $G\\alpha_s$ primarily regulates adenylyl cyclase and cAMP, not directly hyperpolarizing ion channels.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice is B.",

Consider a simplified, well-mixed two-state cycle for the $G\\alpha$ subunit: the inactive guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state and the active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state. Let the GDP-to-GTP exchange be governed by a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{ex}}$ and the GTP hydrolysis (GTP-to-GDP) be governed by a first-order rate constant $k_{\\text{hyd}}$. Assume conservation of total $G\\alpha$ such that the fractions of GDP-bound and GTP-bound $G\\alpha$ sum to $1$, and sustained activation fixes $k_{\\text{ex}}$ at a constant value.

The rate of change of the concentration of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$ is governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ \\frac{d[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{dt} = k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} - k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe problem asks for the steady-state fractions. At steady state, the net rate of change for all species is zero. Therefore, we set $\\frac{d[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}}}{dt} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} - k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThis implies that the rate of formation of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$ is equal to its rate of removal:\n$$ k_{\\text{ex}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} = k_{\\text{hyd}}[G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe problem states that the total concentration of $G\\alpha$, denoted as $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved. We can express this as:\n$$ [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GDP}} + [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} = [G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}} $$\nLet $f_{\\text{GTP}}$ be the fraction of $G\\alpha$ in the $GTP$-bound state, and $f_{\\text{GDP}}$ be the fraction in the $GDP$-bound state.

The problem states that $G\\beta\\gamma$ is free when $G\\alpha$ is bound to $GTP$, with $1:1$ stoichiometry. This means that for every molecule of $G\\alpha\\text{-GTP}$, there is one free $G\\beta\\gamma$ dimer. Let $[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{free}}$ be the concentration of free $G\\beta\\gamma$. The stoichiometric relationship is:\n$$ [G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{free}} = [G\\alpha]_{\\text{GTP}} $$\nThe total concentration of $G\\beta\\gamma$, $[G\\beta\\gamma]_{\\text{total}}$, is equal to the total concentration of $G\\alpha$, $[G\\alpha]_{\\text{total}}$, because they form a heterotrimer.
