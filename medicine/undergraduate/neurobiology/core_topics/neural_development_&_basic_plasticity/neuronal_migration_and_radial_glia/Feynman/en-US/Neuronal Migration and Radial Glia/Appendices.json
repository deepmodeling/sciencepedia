This practice places you in the role of an experimental neurobiologist, tasked with interpreting data from sophisticated genetic experiments . By analyzing the distinct outcomes of deleting the adhesion protein $\\beta_1$ integrin in either neurons or radial glia, you will develop the critical skill of deducing cell-specific functions from phenotypic evidence, a cornerstone of modern biological research.",

            "problem": "A research group investigates whether $\\beta_1$ integrin-mediated adhesion requirements differ between postmitotic cortical neurons and radial glial cells during corticogenesis. They generate two conditional knockouts using floxed $\\beta_1$ integrin alleles: a neuron-specific knockout with neuronal helix-loop-helix protein Nex promoter-driven Cre (Nex-Cre) that deletes $\\beta_1$ integrin in excitatory postmitotic neurons, and a radial glia-specific knockout with human Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein promoter-driven Cre (hGFAP-Cre) that deletes $\\beta_1$ integrin in radial glia. The cortex is analyzed at embryonic day $16.5$ and postnatal day $7$ using extracellular matrix (ECM) laminin immunostaining to assess pial basement membrane integrity, radial glial markers to assess endfeet attachment, and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) birthdating to quantify lamination accuracy.\n\nFoundational facts and definitions:\n- In the cerebral cortex, radial migration of excitatory neurons proceeds along radial glial fibers to establish an inside-out lamination: earlier-born neurons settle in deeper layers and later-born neurons migrate past them to occupy upper layers. The marginal zone contains Cajal-Retzius cells, and correct lamination depends on intact guidance by radial glia and adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM).\n- Integrins are transmembrane receptors that mediate cell adhesion to the ECM. $\\beta_1$ integrin pairs with multiple $\\alpha$ subunits and binds ECM proteins such as laminin and fibronectin. Adhesion via $\\beta_1$ integrin can be required in different cell types for distinct interfaces: radial glial endfeet to the pial basement membrane and migrating neurons to radial glial fibers and ECM.\n- An intact pial basement membrane, which is a laminin-rich basal lamina, constrains radial migration; breaches permit overmigration and ectopias. Disruption of glia-pial adhesion can produce cobblestone-like malformations and widespread lamination failure.\n\nQuantitative measures are defined as follows for each genotype:\n- Basement membrane continuity fraction $f_{\\mathrm{BM}}$ is the fraction of the pial surface length with continuous laminin signal; $f_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\in [0,1]$.\n- Radial glial endfeet attachment fraction $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}}$ is the proportion of identified endfeet in contact with the laminin-positive basement membrane; $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}} \\in [0,1]$.\n- Ectopia rate $e$ is the number of neuronal clusters observed beyond the pial basement membrane per $\\mathrm{mm}$ of pial length; $e \\ge 0$.\n- Mislocalization fractions for BrdU-birthdated cohorts: $m_{\\mathrm{deep}}$ is the fraction of embryonic day $12$ labeled neurons located above the canonical deep-layer boundary at postnatal day $7$, and $m_{\\mathrm{upper}}$ is the fraction of embryonic day $15$ labeled neurons located below the canonical upper-layer boundary; $m_{\\mathrm{deep}}, m_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\in [0,1]$.\n\nEmpirical observations:\n- Control (no Cre): $f_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\approx 0.95$, $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}} \\approx 0.90$, $e \\approx 0$, $m_{\\mathrm{deep}} \\approx 0.05$, $m_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\approx 0.05$.\n- Neuron-specific knockout (Nex-Cre; $\\beta_1^{\\mathrm{fl/fl}}$): $f_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\approx 0.93$, $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}} \\approx 0.88$, $e \\approx 0$, $m_{\\mathrm{deep}} \\approx 0.10$, $m_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\approx 0.35$. In addition, density of neurons in the intermediate zone is increased relative to control by approximately $30\\%$ at embryonic day $16.5$.\n- Radial glia-specific knockout (hGFAP-Cre; $\\beta_1^{\\mathrm{fl/fl}}$): $f_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\approx 0.50$, $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}} \\approx 0.40$, $e \\approx 2.0$ per $\\mathrm{mm}$, $m_{\\mathrm{deep}} \\approx 0.60$, $m_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\approx 0.70$. Laminin staining reveals frequent breaches and undulations of the pial surface, and radial glial fibers appear discontinuous near the marginal zone.\n\nBased solely on these observations and the foundational facts given above, which conclusion is most consistent with the data regarding cell-type-specific adhesion requirements mediated by $\\beta_1$ integrin?\n\nA. $\\beta_1$ integrin function in radial glia is essential for endfeet anchoring to the laminin-rich pial basement membrane and for preventing overmigration and global lamination failure, whereas $\\beta_1$ integrin in neurons primarily supports glia-guided locomotion and later-stage migration fidelity without compromising basement membrane integrity.\n\nB. Neuronal $\\beta_1$ integrin is the principal determinant of basement membrane continuity and endfeet attachment; deleting it in neurons reduces $f_{\\mathrm{BM}}$ and increases $e$, while deleting it in radial glia only modestly increases $m_{\\mathrm{deep}}$.\n\nC. The similar values of $f_{\\mathrm{BM}}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}}$ across both conditional knockouts indicate redundant roles of $\\beta_1$ integrin in neurons and radial glia, with no specific requirement for glia-pial adhesion; lamination defects must be driven by non-adhesion pathways.\n\nD. The observed defects are best explained by changes in adherens junctions in the ventricular zone through cadherin pathways independent of $\\beta_1$ integrin; therefore, neither neuronal nor radial glial $\\beta_1$ integrin is required for pial basement membrane interactions or migration along radial glia, and the differences in $m_{\\mathrm{upper}}$ and $e$ are incidental.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem is to deduce the specific roles of $\\beta_1$ integrin in two different cell types—postmitotic neurons and radial glia—by comparing the phenotypes resulting from cell-type-specific gene deletion.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Radial Glia-Specific Knockout (hGFAP-Cre)**\nThis knockout reveals the function of $\\beta_1$ integrin in radial glial cells.\n-   **Structural Integrity:** Deleting $\\beta_1$ integrin in radial glia causes the basement membrane continuity fraction ($f_{\\mathrm{BM}}$) to drop from $\\approx 0.95$ to $\\approx 0.50$ and the endfeet attachment fraction ($p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}}$) to drop from $\\approx 0.90$ to $\\approx 0.40$. This demonstrates that $\\beta_1$ integrin is essential for anchoring radial glial endfeet to the pial basement membrane.\n-   **Consequences of Failure:** This structural failure leads to severe secondary defects. Neurons overmigrate through the compromised basement membrane, shown by an ectopia rate ($e$) of $\\approx 2.0$ per $\\mathrm{mm}$ (up from zero). The entire lamination process fails, as indicated by the massive mislocalization of both early-born ($m_{\\mathrm{deep}} \\approx 0.60$) and late-born ($m_{\\mathrm{upper}} \\approx 0.70$) neurons.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Neuron-Specific Knockout (Nex-Cre)**\nThis knockout reveals the function of $\\beta_1$ integrin in migrating neurons.\n-   **Structural Integrity:** Deleting $\\beta_1$ integrin in neurons has almost no effect on the basement membrane or glial endfeet attachment ($f_{\\mathrm{BM}} \\approx 0.93$, $p_{\\mathrm{endfeet}} \\approx 0.88$, $e \\approx 0$). This shows that neuronal $\\beta_1$ integrin is not required for the overall structural integrity of the cortex.\n-   **Migration Fidelity:** There is a significant defect in neuronal positioning. The mislocalization of late-born neurons ($m_{\\mathrm{upper}}$) rises to $\\approx 0.35$. This, along with the increased neuron density in the intermediate zone, points to a migration stall. Neurons are unable to move efficiently along the glial scaffold.\n\n**3. Evaluating the Options**\n-   **Option A** accurately summarizes these distinct roles: $\\beta_1$ integrin in radial glia is crucial for anchoring and structural integrity, while in neurons, it is for locomotion and migration fidelity. This matches our analysis.\n-   **Option B** is incorrect. It wrongly attributes basement membrane integrity to neuronal $\\beta_1$ integrin and understates the severe defects in the radial glia knockout.\n-   **Option C** is incorrect because the experimental values are drastically different between the two knockouts, indicating distinct, not redundant, roles.\n-   **Option D** is incorrect as it introduces an unsupported hypothesis about cadherins and wrongly dismisses the clear, systematic effects of deleting $\\beta_1$ integrin.\n\nTherefore, the data most strongly support the conclusion in Option A.",

            "problem": "Neurons migrating along Radial Glial cells (radial glia) often exhibit contact-guided motion with intermittent reorientations. A commonly used framework for such behavior is the Persistent Random Walk (PRW). In a PRW, the instantaneous velocity vector is modeled as $\\mathbf{v}(t) = v \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t)$, where $v$ is a constant speed and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is a unit direction vector whose orientation decorrelates over time due to stochastic reorientations. In two-dimensional motion, assume isotropy and stationarity, and that the direction autocorrelation decays exponentially with a characteristic persistence time $P$, so that $\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(0) \\rangle = \\exp(-t/P)$.

Then, interpret this result in the context of neuronal migration guided by radial glia.\n\nFinally, use your derived expression to evaluate the MSD numerically for a neuron with speed $v = 0.5$ micrometers per minute, persistence time $P = 30$ minutes, evaluated at $t = 120$ minutes. Express the final MSD in micrometers squared and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "We begin with the definition of the Mean Squared Displacement, $\\mathrm{MSD}(t)$, for a particle whose position at time $t$ is given by the vector $\\mathbf{r}(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\equiv \\langle |\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)|^{2} \\rangle\n$$\nHere, $\\mathbf{r}(0)$ is the initial position and the angle brackets $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$ denote an ensemble average over all possible trajectories.\n\nThe displacement vector, $\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0)$, is given by the time integral of the instantaneous velocity vector, $\\mathbf{v}(t)$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbf{v}(s)\\,ds\n$$\nSubstituting this into the MSD definition, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\left\\langle \\left| \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbf{v}(s)\\,ds \\right|^2 \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe squared magnitude of the integral can be written as a dot product of the integral with itself. To avoid confusion of variables, we use two different dummy variables of integration, $s$ and $s'$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbf{v}(s)\\,ds \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbf{v}(s')\\,ds' \\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThis product of integrals can be expressed as a double integral:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\left\\langle \\int_{0}^{t} ds \\int_{0}^{t} ds' \\, \\mathbf{v}(s) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(s') \\right\\rangle\n$$\nSince the ensemble average and the integration are both linear operations, their order can be interchanged:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} ds \\int_{0}^{t} ds' \\, \\langle \\mathbf{v}(s) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(s') \\rangle\n$$\nThe term inside the integral, $\\langle \\mathbf{v}(s) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}(s') \\rangle$, is the velocity autocorrelation function. The problem states that the velocity is $\\mathbf{v}(t) = v \\,\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t)$, where the speed $v$ is a constant and $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t)$ is a unit direction vector.

The problem states that the process is stationary, meaning the correlation depends only on the time difference $\\tau = s - s'$. Furthermore, it provides the explicit form for this correlation: $\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(t) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(0) \\rangle = \\exp(-t/P)$. For arbitrary times $s$ and $s'$, due to stationarity, this becomes $\\langle \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(s) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}}(s') \\rangle = \\exp(-|s-s'|/P)$, where $P$ is the persistence time.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the MSD, we have:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = v^2 \\int_{0}^{t} ds \\int_{0}^{t} ds' \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|s-s'|}{P}\\right)\n$$\nTo evaluate this double integral, we can split the square domain of integration ($0 \\le s \\le t$, $0 \\le s' \\le t$) into two triangular regions: one where $s' < s$ and one where $s' > s$. Due to the symmetry of the integrand with respect to $s$ and $s'$, the integral over both regions is identical. We can therefore calculate the integral over one region and multiply the result by $2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 \\int_{0}^{t} ds \\int_{0}^{s} ds' \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s-s'}{P}\\right)\n$$\nWe first evaluate the inner integral with respect to $s'$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{s} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s-s'}{P}\\right) ds' = \\int_{0}^{s} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{s'}{P}\\right) ds' = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\left[ P \\exp\\left(\\frac{s'}{P}\\right) \\right]_{s'=0}^{s'=s}\n$$\n$$\n= \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\left( P \\exp\\left(\\frac{s}{P}\\right) - P \\exp(0) \\right) = P \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the outer integral and evaluate with respect to $s$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 \\int_{0}^{t} P \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\right) ds\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P \\left[ s - (-P) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\right]_{s=0}^{s=t} = 2v^2 P \\left[ s + P \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{P}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P \\left\\{ \\left( t + P \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{P}\\right) \\right) - \\left( 0 + P \\exp(0) \\right) \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P \\left( t + P \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{P}\\right) - P \\right)\n$$\nThis gives the closed-form expression for the Mean Squared Displacement:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P^2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{P}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can also be written in the form $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P^2 \\left[ \\frac{t}{P} - 1 + \\exp(-\\frac{t}{P}) \\right]$.\n\nThe interpretation of this result in the context of neuronal migration is as follows. The equation reveals two distinct regimes of motion depending on the relationship between the elapsed time $t$ and the persistence time $P$.\n1.  **Short-time (ballistic) regime ($t \\ll P$):** For times much shorter than the persistence time, we can Taylor expand the exponential term: $\\exp(-t/P) \\approx 1 - t/P + \\frac{1}{2}(t/P)^2$.\n    Substituting this into the derived expression:\n    $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P^2 \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{t}{P} + \\frac{t^2}{2P^2}\\right)\\right) = 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P^2 \\left(\\frac{t}{P} - \\frac{t^2}{2P^2}\\right) = 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P t + v^2 t^2 = (vt)^2$.\n    This quadratic dependence on time, $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\propto t^2$, is characteristic of ballistic motion. In the biological context, this corresponds to a neuron moving persistently along a radial glial fiber, almost in a straight line, before it has had a chance to reorient. Its displacement is simply its speed multiplied by time.\n2.  **Long-time (diffusive) regime ($t \\gg P$):** For times much longer than the persistence time, the exponential term $\\exp(-t/P)$ approaches zero.\n    The MSD expression becomes: $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\approx 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P^2$.\n    In this limit, the MSD is dominated by the term linear in time, $\\mathrm{MSD}(t) \\propto t$, which is characteristic of diffusive or random-walk-like motion. Biologically, this represents the neuron's trajectory after it has undergone many reorientations. While its short-term motion is directed, its long-term path becomes randomized. The effective diffusion coefficient for this process is $D_{eff} = v^2 P/2$ (in $2$D, $\\mathrm{MSD} \\approx 4 D_{eff} t = 2v^2Pt$). The persistence time $P$ dictates the timescale for the transition from directed, efficient motion to random, diffusive-like behavior. A longer $P$ implies the neuron adheres to its path on the glial fiber for longer periods before reorienting.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the MSD for the given numerical values: $v = 0.5 \\, \\mu\\text{m/min}$, $P = 30 \\, \\text{min}$, and $t = 120 \\, \\text{min}$.\nThe dimensionless time is $t/P = 120/30 = 4$.\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(t) = 2v^2 P t - 2v^2 P^2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{P}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) = 2(0.5)^2(30)(120) - 2(0.5)^2(30)^2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{120}{30}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) = 2(0.25)(3600) - 2(0.25)(900) \\left(1 - \\exp(-4)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) = (0.5)(3600) - (0.5)(900) \\left(1 - \\exp(-4)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) = 1800 - 450 \\left(1 - \\exp(-4)\\right)\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(-4) \\approx 0.0183156$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) \\approx 1800 - 450 (1 - 0.0183156) = 1800 - 450 (0.9816844)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{MSD}(120) \\approx 1800 - 441.75798 = 1358.24202\n$$\nThe units are $(\\mu\\text{m/min})^2 \\cdot (\\text{min})^2 = \\mu\\text{m}^2$.

            "problem": "You are given a scientifically grounded scenario involving neuronal migration along Radial Glia during cortical development, modeled in patient-derived induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) organoids. Doublecortin (DCX) is a microtubule-associated protein whose mutation is known to destabilize microtubules, increasing intermittency of movement during migration. You will formalize this as a two-state renewal process that generates per-track average velocities and then perform a one-sided test to assess whether the variance of the velocity distribution increases in DCX-mutant organoids relative to controls.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- Neuronal migration along the Radial Glia scaffold is modeled as alternating \"run\" and \"pause\" states that repeat until a fixed observation window ends. The instantaneous \"run\" state yields displacement along the scaffold, while the \"pause\" state yields zero displacement.\n- Average velocity over a track is defined as $v = \\Delta x / \\Delta t$. With total displacement $x(T)$ accumulated over observation duration $T$ (in minutes), the average velocity expressed in micrometers per hour is $v_{\\mu \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}} = \\left(\\dfrac{x(T)}{T}\\right) \\times 60$.\n- Run durations are modeled by a Gamma distribution $\\mathrm{Gamma}(k_r, \\theta_r)$, where $k_r$ is the shape and $\\theta_r$ is the scale, with mean $\\mu_r = k_r \\theta_r$ and variance $\\sigma_r^2 = k_r \\theta_r^2$.\n- Pause durations are modeled by a Gamma distribution $\\mathrm{Gamma}(k_p, \\theta_p)$, where $k_p$ is the shape and $\\theta_p$ is the scale, with mean $\\mu_p = k_p \\theta_p$ and variance $\\sigma_p^2 = k_p \\theta_p^2$.\n- During the run state, displacement accumulates at constant speed $s$ (in micrometers per minute), so a run of duration $\\tau_r$ contributes displacement $\\Delta x = s \\tau_r$. Pauses contribute $\\Delta x = 0$.\n- You will assume that the per-track average velocities are approximately normally distributed across tracks due to the Central Limit Theorem under renewal processes with finite-variance waiting times.\n\nTask:\n1.

Modeling and Simulation of a Single Neuronal Track**\n\nThe migration of a single neuron is modeled as a two-state renewal process, where the neuron alternates between a 'run' state and a 'pause' state.\n\n- **Run State**: The neuron moves at a constant speed $s$ (in $\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{min}$). The durations of these runs, $\\tau_r$, are random variables drawn from a Gamma distribution, $\\tau_r \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_r, \\theta_r)$.\n- **Pause State**: The neuron is stationary. The durations of these pauses, $\\tau_p$, are also random variables drawn from a different Gamma distribution, $\\tau_p \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_p, \\theta_p)$.\n\nThe simulation for a single track proceeds for a fixed total observation time $T$ (in minutes). The algorithm to compute the total displacement $x(T)$ for one track is as follows:\n1. Initialize total time elapsed, $t_{total} = 0$, and total displacement, $x_{total} = 0$.\n2. Use a pseudo-random number generator, initialized with a fixed seed of $42$ for reproducibility.\n3. Begin in the 'run' state.\n4. Loop until $t_{total} \\ge T$:\n    a. In the current state (run or pause), draw the corresponding duration $\\tau$ from its Gamma distribution. For a run, $\\tau \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_r, \\theta_r)$; for a pause, $\\tau \\sim \\mathrm{Gamma}(k_p, \\theta_p)$.\n    b. The time remaining in the observation window is $t_{rem} = T - t_{total}$.\n    c. The duration of the current step, $\\tau_{step}$, is the minimum of the drawn duration and the remaining time: $\\tau_{step} = \\min(\\tau, t_{rem})$.\n    d. If the current state is a 'run', update the displacement: $x_{total} = x_{total} + s \\times \\tau_{step}$.\n    e. Update the total time: $t_{total} = t_{total} + \\tau_{step}$.\n    f. Switch to the alternate state for the next iteration.\n\nOnce the loop terminates (i.e., $t_{total} = T$), we have the total displacement $x(T)$. The average velocity for this track, in units of micrometers per hour, is calculated using the provided formula:\n$$\nv_{\\mu \\mathrm{m}/\\mathrm{h}} = \\left( \\frac{x(T)}{T} \\right) \\times 60\n$$\n\n**2. Population Simulation**\n\nThis single-track simulation is repeated to generate populations of neurons for both the control and DCX-mutant groups. For each of the four test cases:\n- We simulate $n_c$ tracks using the control group parameters ($s_c, k_{r,c}, \\theta_{r,c}, k_{p,c}, \\theta_{p,c}$) to obtain a set of control velocities $\\{v_{c,1}, v_{c,2}, \\dots, v_{c, n_c}\\}$.\n- We simulate $n_m$ tracks using the mutant group parameters ($s_m, k_{r,m}, \\theta_{r,m}, k_{p,m}, \\theta_{p,m}$) to obtain a set of mutant velocities $\\{v_{m,1}, v_{m,2}, \\dots, v_{m, n_m}\\}$.\nThe problem states that these average velocities are assumed to be approximately normally distributed, which is a key assumption for the subsequent statistical test.\n\n**3. Statistical Analysis: F-test for Variance Comparison**\n\nThe central task is to test whether the variance of average velocities is greater in the mutant group. This is a one-sided hypothesis test for the ratio of two variances.\n\nThe hypotheses are:\n- Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): The population variances are equal, $\\sigma_m^2 = \\sigma_c^2$.\n- Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$): The mutant group variance is greater than the control group variance, $\\sigma_m^2 > \\sigma_c^2$.\n\nThe procedure is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the unbiased sample variance for each group. For a sample $\\{y_1, \\dots, y_n\\}$ with mean $\\bar{y}$, the unbiased sample variance is $\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \\bar{y})^2$. We compute $\\hat{\\sigma}_c^2$ for the control group and $\\hat{\\sigma}_m^2$ for the mutant group.\n2.  Compute the F-test statistic, which is the ratio of the sample variances:\n    $$\n    F = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_m^2}{\\hat{\\sigma}_c^2}\n    $$\n    Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows an F-distribution.\n3.  The degrees of freedom for the F-distribution are derived from the sample sizes: $d_m = n_m - 1$ for the numerator and $d_c = n_c - 1$ for the denominator.\n4.  The $p$-value for this one-sided test is the probability of observing an F-statistic as large or larger than the one computed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This corresponds to the survival function (SF) of the F-distribution, evaluated at the observed statistic $F$:\n    $$\n    p\\text{-value} = P(X \\ge F \\mid X \\sim F(d_m, d_c)) = \\text{sf}(F, d_m, d_c)\n    $$\n5.  Finally, we compare the $p$-value to the given significance level, $\\alpha = 0.05$. If $p < \\alpha$, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is significant evidence that the variance in the mutant group is greater. The result for the test case is $\\text{True}$. Otherwise, if $p \\ge \\alpha$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and the result is $\\text{False}$.\n\nThis entire process is computationally implemented for each of the four test cases to determine the final boolean outcome.",
