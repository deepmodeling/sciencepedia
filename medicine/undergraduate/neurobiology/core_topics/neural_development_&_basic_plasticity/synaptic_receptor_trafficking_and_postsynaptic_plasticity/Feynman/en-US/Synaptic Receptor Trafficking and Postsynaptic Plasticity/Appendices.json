This exercise demonstrates how to quantitatively link molecular modifications of AMPA receptors, a key event in Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), to the resulting change in the excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC). By performing this calculation, you will solidify your understanding of the fundamental equation of synaptic transmission and see how specific phosphorylation events fine-tune synaptic efficacy .",

            "problem": "A glutamatergic synapse in a cultured hippocampal neuron expresses $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors containing the glutamate receptor 1 (GluA1) subunit. During a brief synaptic glutamate transient, the peak Excitatory Postsynaptic Current (EPSC) magnitude is determined by the number of available receptors, their probability of being open at the peak, the single-channel conductance, and the electrochemical driving force. Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) engages Calcium/Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase II (CaMKII) and Protein Kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylate GluA1 at serine $831$ (S831) and serine $845$ (S845), respectively. Empirically, S831 phosphorylation enhances single-channel conductance, and S845 phosphorylation increases the peak open probability.\n\nAssume the following baseline parameters before phosphorylation: the number of functional synaptic receptors is $N = 100$, the baseline single-channel conductance is $\\gamma_{0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{pS}$, the baseline peak open probability is $p_{o,0} = 0.30$, the membrane holding potential is $V_{m} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and the AMPA reversal potential is $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. After LTP induction, S831 phosphorylation increases the single-channel conductance by $0.20$ relative to baseline, and S845 phosphorylation increases the peak open probability by $0.15$ relative to baseline. Assume $N$, $V_{m}$, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ do not change with phosphorylation.\n\nUsing only fundamental electrophysiological principles, compute the new EPSC peak amplitude magnitude after phosphorylation and express your final result in picoamperes. Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The peak Excitatory Postsynaptic Current ($I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}}$) at a synapse is the collective result of current flowing through multiple individual ion channels. This macroscopic current can be described by the following fundamental relationship:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}} = N \\cdot p_{o} \\cdot i$$\nIn this equation, $N$ represents the total number of functional receptors, $p_{o}$ is the probability that a single channel is open at the peak of the synaptic event, and $i$ is the current flowing through a single open channel.\n\nThe single-channel current, $i$, is governed by Ohm's law, where it is the product of the single-channel conductance, $\\gamma$, and the electrochemical driving force. The driving force is the difference between the membrane potential, $V_m$, and the reversal potential for the ions conducted by the channel, $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$.\n$$i = \\gamma \\cdot (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nCombining these two equations provides a comprehensive model for the peak synaptic current:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC}} = N \\cdot p_{o} \\cdot \\gamma \\cdot (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nThe problem provides the following baseline parameters:\n-   Number of receptors: $N = 100$\n-   Baseline single-channel conductance: $\\gamma_{0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{pS}$\n-   Baseline peak open probability: $p_{o,0} = 0.30$\n-   Membrane holding potential: $V_{m} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n-   AMPA reversal potential: $E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nFollowing the induction of Long-Term Potentiation (LTP), phosphorylation modifies some of these parameters. We need to calculate the new values for conductance and open probability.\n\nThe problem states that S831 phosphorylation increases the single-channel conductance by $0.20$ relative to baseline. This is interpreted as a $20\\%$ increase. The new conductance, $\\gamma_1$, is therefore:\n$$\\gamma_1 = \\gamma_0 \\cdot (1 + 0.20) = 12\\,\\mathrm{pS} \\cdot 1.20 = 14.4\\,\\mathrm{pS}$$\n\nSimilarly, S845 phosphorylation increases the peak open probability by $0.15$ relative to baseline, which is a $15\\%$ increase. The new peak open probability, $p_{o,1}$, is:\n$$p_{o,1} = p_{o,0} \\cdot (1 + 0.15) = 0.30 \\cdot 1.15 = 0.345$$\n\nThe number of receptors ($N$), membrane potential ($V_m$), and reversal potential ($E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$) are stated to be constant. We can now compute the new EPSC peak amplitude, $I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1}$, using the post-LTP parameters.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = N \\cdot p_{o,1} \\cdot \\gamma_1 \\cdot (V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into the equation:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = 100 \\cdot 0.345 \\cdot (14.4\\,\\mathrm{pS}) \\cdot (-70\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = 100 \\cdot 0.345 \\cdot 14.4\\,\\mathrm{pS} \\cdot (-70\\,\\mathrm{mV})$$\n\nTo perform the calculation and obtain the final answer in picoamperes ($pA$), we must manage the units correctly. A convenient identity in electrophysiology is that current in picoamperes equals conductance in picoSiemens ($pS$) multiplied by the potential difference in Volts ($V$). First, we convert the driving force from millivolts to volts:\n$$V_m - E_{\\mathrm{rev}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV} = -0.070\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nNow, we can calculate the current in picoamperes:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = 100 \\cdot 0.345 \\cdot 14.4 \\cdot (-0.070)\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = 34.5 \\cdot 14.4 \\cdot (-0.070)\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = 496.8 \\cdot (-0.070)\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\n$$I_{\\mathrm{EPSC},1} = -34.776\\,\\mathrm{pA}$$\nThe negative sign indicates an inward flow of positive charge (cations), consistent with an excitatory current at this membrane potential.

Two-photon fluorescence imaging of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluA1 in the same synapses shows that synaptic GluA1 signal increases by a factor of $1.30$. Assume the following scientifically realistic conditions: the holding potential $V$ and the AMPA receptor reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are unchanged across measurements, presynaptic release properties are unchanged, and the synaptic GluA1 signal scales linearly with the number of functional AMPA receptors $N$ at the synapse. Further assume that, in addition to the change in $N$, either the open probability $p_{o}$ or the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ changed (but not both), and that gating kinetics other than $p_{o}$ are unchanged.\n\nUsing foundational definitions of macroscopic current for ligand-gated ion channels and the above assumptions, determine the single multiplicative factor by which either $p_{o}$ or $\\gamma$ must have changed to reconcile the observed electrophysiological and imaging data. Express your answer as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the multiplicative factor by which either the single-channel open probability or the single-channel conductance of AMPA receptors has changed, given macroscopic electrophysiological and microscopic imaging data before and after a long-term potentiation (LTP) protocol.\n\nThe foundational principle connecting microscopic channel properties to macroscopic current is the biophysical model for current flow through a population of ion channels. The peak macroscopic excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), denoted as $I$, is given by the product of the number of functional channels ($N$), the peak open probability of a single channel ($p_o$), and the current that flows through a single open channel ($i$):\n$$I = N \\times p_o \\times i$$\nThe single-channel current, $i$, is governed by Ohm's law for an ion channel:\n$$i = \\gamma (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the single-channel conductance, $V$ is the membrane holding potential, and $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ is the reversal potential for the ions permeating the channel.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $i$ into the equation for $I$, we obtain the full expression for the macroscopic current:\n$$I = N \\times p_o \\times \\gamma \\times (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\n\nWe can write specific equations for the baseline state (before LTP) and the potentiated state (after LTP). Let the subscript 'base' denote the baseline state and 'LTP' denote the potentiated state.\n\nThe baseline EPSC amplitude is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{base}} = N_{\\mathrm{base}} \\times p_{o, \\mathrm{base}} \\times \\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}} \\times (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\nThe potentiated EPSC amplitude is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = N_{\\mathrm{LTP}} \\times p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}} \\times \\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}} \\times (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$$\n\nThe problem states that the holding potential $V$ and the reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}$ are unchanged. To determine the relationship between the changes in the parameters, we can take the ratio of the potentiated current to the baseline current:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{LTP}} \\times p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}} \\times \\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}} \\times (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})}{N_{\\mathrm{base}} \\times p_{o, \\mathrm{base}} \\times \\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}} \\times (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})}$$\nThe term $(V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}})$ is a constant factor and cancels out, simplifying the equation to:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\left(\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{N_{\\mathrm{base}}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}}}{p_{o, \\mathrm{base}}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}}}\\right)$$\nThis equation states that the potentiation of the macroscopic current is the product of the fold-change in the number of receptors, the fold-change in the open probability, and the fold-change in the single-channel conductance.\n\nWe are given the following information from the problem statement:\n1.  The EPSC amplitude increases by a factor of $1.50$. This means:\n    $$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{I_{\\mathrm{base}}} = 1.50$$\n2.  The synaptic GluA1 signal increases by a factor of $1.30$. Since this signal is assumed to scale linearly with the number of functional AMPA receptors $N$, the number of receptors also increases by this factor:\n    $$\\frac{N_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{N_{\\mathrm{base}}} = 1.30$$\n\nLet $f$ be the single multiplicative factor by which either $p_o$ or $\\gamma$ changed. The problem states that only one of these two parameters changes. We can analyze this condition:\n- If only $p_o$ changes, then $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}}$, which implies $\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}}} = 1$. The change in $p_o$ is thus $\\frac{p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}}}{p_{o, \\mathrm{base}}} = f$.\n- If only $\\gamma$ changes, then $p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}} = p_{o, \\mathrm{base}}$, which implies $\\frac{p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}}}{p_{o, \\mathrm{base}}} = 1$. The change in $\\gamma$ is thus $\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}}} = f$.\n\nIn both cases, the product of the two ratios concerning channel properties is equal to $f$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{p_{o, \\mathrm{LTP}}}{p_{o, \\mathrm{base}}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{LTP}}}{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{base}}}\\right) = f$$\nNow we can substitute the known values into our main ratio equation:\n$$1.50 = (1.30) \\times f$$\nWe can solve for $f$, which represents the portion of the electrophysiological potentiation that is not accounted for by the increase in receptor number:\n$$f = \\frac{1.50}{1.30}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$f = \\frac{15}{13} \\approx 1.153846...$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $8$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$f \\approx 1.154$$\nThis dimensionless factor of approximately $1.154$ represents the necessary increase in either the channel open probability $p_o$ or the single-channel conductance $\\gamma$ to reconcile the observed $1.50$-fold increase in synaptic current with the measured $1.30$-fold increase in synaptic AMPA receptor number.",

            "problem": "Synaptic receptor trafficking during postsynaptic plasticity often relies on lateral diffusion of membrane proteins along the continuous plasma membrane from the dendritic shaft into a dendritic spine head. Consider a dendritic spine head whose membrane is treated as a well-mixed compartment of area $S_{h}$, connected to the dendritic shaft by a narrow cylindrical neck of length $L$ and radius $r$. Let the areal density of a freely diffusing membrane protein on the spine head be $\\sigma_{h}(t)$ and on the shaft (just outside the neck) be clamped at a constant value $\\sigma_{0}$ by a large reservoir. Assume the following:\n- Diffusion of the protein is purely lateral within the membrane with constant surface diffusion coefficient $D_{m}$.\n- Transport through the neck is effectively one-dimensional along the neck axis due to axial symmetry and small radius, with the neck surface area given by $2\\pi r L$.\n- The neck is narrow enough that the axial profile of areal density across it can be approximated as linear between $\\sigma_{h}(t)$ at the head entrance and $\\sigma_{0}$ at the shaft entrance at any given time.\n- No binding, endocytosis, exocytosis, or synthesis occurs during the time window considered, and the spine head remains well-mixed.\n\nUsing Fick’s first law on surfaces, $ \\mathbf{j}_{s} = - D_{m} \\nabla_{s} \\sigma$, and conservation of protein number in the spine head, derive the first-order relaxation of $\\sigma_{h}(t)$ toward $\\sigma_{0}$ and compute the characteristic time constant $\\tau$ of this exponential relaxation. Express your final answer as a closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $L$, $r$, $S_{h}$, and $D_{m}$. Do not include units in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The core principle governing the change in the number of protein molecules in the dendritic spine head is the conservation of mass. The rate of change of the total number of proteins on the spine head, $N_{h}(t)$, must equal the net flux of proteins, $J$, entering the head from the dendritic shaft through the connecting neck. This can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{h}(t)}{dt} = J\n$$\n\nThe spine head is treated as a well-mixed compartment of area $S_{h}$. The total number of proteins is the product of its areal density, $\\sigma_{h}(t)$, and its area:\n$$\nN_{h}(t) = S_{h} \\sigma_{h}(t)\n$$\nSince the area $S_{h}$ is constant, the rate of change of the protein number is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_{h}(t)}{dt} = S_{h} \\frac{d\\sigma_{h}(t)}{dt}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the flux $J$. The flux occurs through the cylindrical neck of length $L$ and radius $r$. The problem states that protein transport through the neck is effectively one-dimensional along the neck's axis. We can use Fick's first law for surface diffusion, which is given as $\\mathbf{j}_{s} = - D_{m} \\nabla_{s} \\sigma$, where $\\mathbf{j}_{s}$ is the flux density (number of particles per unit length per unit time), $D_{m}$ is the surface diffusion coefficient, and $\\nabla_{s} \\sigma$ is the surface gradient of the areal density $\\sigma$.\n\nIn the one-dimensional case along the neck axis, let's denote the coordinate by $x$, where $x=0$ corresponds to the entrance from the shaft and $x=L$ corresponds to the entrance to the head. The gradient becomes $\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}$. The flux density directed along the positive $x$-axis (towards the head) is:\n$$\nj_{x} = -D_{m} \\frac{d\\sigma}{dx}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the areal density profile across the neck is linear. The boundary conditions for the density in the neck are $\\sigma(x=0) = \\sigma_{0}$ and $\\sigma(x=L) = \\sigma_{h}(t)$. A linear profile connecting these two points is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = \\sigma_{0} + \\frac{\\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}}{L} x\n$$\nThe gradient of the density along the neck is therefore constant:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = \\frac{\\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this gradient into the expression for the flux density gives:\n$$\nj_{x} = -D_{m} \\frac{\\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}}{L}\n$$\nThe total flux $J$ (number of particles per unit time) entering the head is the flux density $j_{x}$ multiplied by the perimeter of the neck through which diffusion occurs, which is the circumference $2\\pi r$.\n$$\nJ = (2\\pi r) j_{x} = (2\\pi r) \\left(-D_{m} \\frac{\\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}}{L}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{L} (\\sigma_{0} - \\sigma_{h}(t))\n$$\nThis expression is physically consistent: if the density in the shaft, $\\sigma_{0}$, is greater than in the head, $\\sigma_{h}(t)$, the flux $J$ is positive, indicating a net flow into the head.\n\nNow, we equate the rate of change of the number of proteins in the head with this flux:\n$$\nS_{h} \\frac{d\\sigma_{h}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{L} (\\sigma_{0} - \\sigma_{h}(t))\n$$\nTo identify the characteristic time constant, we rearrange this equation into the standard form of a first-order relaxation process. Let's isolate the derivative term:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{h}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{S_{h} L} (\\sigma_{0} - \\sigma_{h}(t))\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. To see the relaxation form clearly, let's define a new variable representing the deviation from the equilibrium density $\\sigma_{0}$: $\\Delta\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}$. The time derivative is $\\frac{d(\\Delta\\sigma)}{dt} = \\frac{d\\sigma_{h}}{dt}$, since $\\sigma_{0}$ is a constant. Substituting $\\Delta\\sigma$ into the equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\Delta\\sigma(t))}{dt} = -\\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{S_{h} L} (\\sigma_{h}(t) - \\sigma_{0}) = -\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{S_{h} L}\\right) \\Delta\\sigma(t)\n$$\nThis equation is in the canonical form for exponential decay: $\\frac{dy}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}y$, where $y(t) = \\Delta\\sigma(t)$ and $\\tau$ is the characteristic time constant of the relaxation. By comparison, we can identify the term $\\frac{1}{\\tau}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{2\\pi r D_{m}}{S_{h} L}\n$$\nSolving for the time constant $\\tau$ by taking the reciprocal gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{S_{h} L}{2\\pi r D_{m}}\n$$\nThis result shows that the system exhibits first-order relaxation, and the time constant $\\tau$ depends directly on the spine head area $S_{h}$ and neck length $L$, and inversely on the neck radius $r$ and the diffusion coefficient $D_{m}$, which is consistent with physical intuition for a diffusion-limited process.",
