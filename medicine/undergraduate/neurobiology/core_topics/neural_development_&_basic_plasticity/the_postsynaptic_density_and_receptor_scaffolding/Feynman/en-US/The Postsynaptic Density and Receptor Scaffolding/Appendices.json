A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to first derive a general symbolic expression for the number of CaMKII molecules, $N$, and then to calculate its numerical value using the provided parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Symbolic Expression**\n\nWe begin with the core definitions provided in the problem statement.\n1. The definition of molar concentration, $c$, is the number of moles, $n$, per unit volume, $V$:\n$$c = \\frac{n}{V}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the number of moles, $n$, in terms of concentration and volume:\n$$n = cV$$\n\n2. The number of molecules, $N$, is related to the number of moles, $n$, by Avogadro's number, $N_{A}$:\n$$N = n N_{A}$$\n\n3. Substituting the expression for $n$ from the first step into the second equation yields an expression for $N$ in terms of $c$, $V$, and $N_{A}$:\n$$N = (cV) N_{A}$$\n\n4. The PSD is modeled as a slab with area $A$ and thickness $t$. The volume, $V$, of such a slab is given by:\n$$V = At$$\n\n5. Finally, we substitute this geometric relation for the volume $V$ into our expression for $N$:\n$$N = c(At)N_{A}$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the number of CaMKII holoenzymes, $N$, in the PSD.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nTo evaluate $N$, we must use a consistent set of units for all parameters. We will convert all quantities to SI base units (meters, moles).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- $A = 0.085 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $t = 38 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n- $c = 130 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $N_{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we convert the area $A$ from square micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$) to square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^2$). Since $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$A = 0.085 \\ (\\mu\\mathrm{m})^{2} = 0.085 \\times (10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m})^{2} = 0.085 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$$\n\nNext, we convert the thickness $t$ from nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$). Since $1 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$t = 38 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 38 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNow, we convert the concentration $c$ from micromolar ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) to moles per cubic meter ($\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$). The molar unit is moles per liter ($\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$). First, $1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{M} = 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Second, we use the conversion factor $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}^3$.\n$$c = 130 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} = 130 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n$$c = 130 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mol}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{3}} = 130 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n\nWith all parameters in SI units, we can substitute them into our derived formula $N = c A t N_{A}$:\n$$N = (130 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (0.085 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\times (38 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1})$$\n\nThe units cancel as expected: $(\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{m} \\cdot \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} = 1$, yielding a dimensionless count for $N$.\n\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n$$N = (130)(0.085)(38)(6.022) \\times 10^{(-3 - 12 - 9 + 23)}$$\n$$N = (130 \\times 0.085 \\times 38 \\times 6.022) \\times 10^{-1}$$\nThe product of the coefficients is:\n$$130 \\times 0.085 \\times 38 \\times 6.022 \\approx 2528.5578$$\nTherefore:\n$$N \\approx 2528.5578 \\times 10^{-1} = 252.85578$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$N \\approx 252.9$$\nThus, the approximate number of CaMKII holoenzymes in the idealized PSD is $252.9$.",

First, we determine the new dissociation constant, $K_d^{(p)}$, after phosphorylation. The basal dissociation constant is $K_d^{(0)} = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{mM}$. Phosphorylation reduces this value by a fraction of $0.40$.\nThe reduction amount is $0.40 \\times K_d^{(0)}$.

The objective is clearly stated, and a unique solution for $r^{*}$ exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe emergence of a giant component in a random network can be analyzed by considering a branching process. We start at a random node and explore its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, to map out the cluster to which it belongs. A giant component exists if this process has a non-zero probability of continuing indefinitely.\n\nLet the degree distribution of the network be $P(k)$, where $k$ is the number of potential connections (degree) of a node. The first moment (mean degree) is $\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_{k} k P(k)$, and the second moment is $\\langle k^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{k} k^2 P(k)$.\n\nThe critical insight for percolation on random networks involves analyzing the cluster from the perspective of a traversed edge. The probability that a randomly chosen edge leads to a node of degree $k$ is proportional to $kP(k)$. This is because nodes with higher degrees have more edges connected to them. Normalizing this, the degree distribution of a node reached by following a random edge is $P_{\\text{neighbor}}(k) = \\frac{k P(k)}{\\sum_{k'} k' P(k')} = \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle}$.\n\nWhen we arrive at a node of degree $k$ by traversing one of its edges, there are $k-1$ other edges extending from it. These are often called \"outgoing\" edges in the context of the branching process. The average number of such outgoing edges from a neighbor node is the mean of the \"excess degree\" distribution, $k-1$.\n$$\n\\langle k-1 \\rangle_{\\text{neighbor}} = \\sum_{k} (k-1) P_{\\text{neighbor}}(k) = \\sum_{k} (k-1) \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle k-1 \\rangle_{\\text{neighbor}} = \\frac{1}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\sum_{k} (k^2 - k) P(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{k} k^2 P(k) - \\sum_{k} k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n$$\nThis quantity represents the average number of *potential* new paths from a node reached along an existing path. In bond percolation, each of these potential bonds is actually present (occupied) with an independent probability $p$. Therefore, the average number of *occupied* outgoing edges from a node reached via an occupied edge is the branching ratio, $Q$.\n$$\nQ = p \\times \\langle k-1 \\rangle_{\\text{neighbor}} = p \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n$$\nA giant component emerges if and only if this branching process is supercritical, meaning that on average, each step leads to more than one new branch. The condition for the emergence of a giant component is therefore $Q > 1$.\n$$\np \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle} > 1\n$$\nThis is the general condition for the existence of a giant component in a random network with a given degree distribution and bond occupation probability $p$. The critical probability for percolation, $p_c$, is the value of $p$ for which $Q=1$, giving $p_c = \\frac{\\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}$.\n\nNext, we apply this result to the specific case where the degree distribution is Poisson with mean $\\lambda$. For a Poisson distribution, the moments are well-known:\nThe first moment is $\\langle k \\rangle = \\lambda$.\nThe second moment is $\\langle k^2 \\rangle = \\lambda^2 + \\lambda$.\n\nSubstituting these moments into our general condition for percolation:\n$$\np \\frac{(\\lambda^2 + \\lambda) - \\lambda}{\\lambda} > 1\n$$\n$$\np \\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda} > 1\n$$\n$$\np\\lambda > 1\n$$\nThis is the simplified condition for percolation in a network with a Poisson degree distribution. The critical probability is $p_c = 1/\\lambda$.\n\nThe problem requires that *both* the NMDA and AMPA receptor layers are above their respective percolation thresholds. The problem states that the bond formation probability $p$ is scaled by the fraction of functional PDZ sites, $r$, such that $p=r$.\n\nFor the NMDA receptor layer, we have a mean degree of $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{N}} = 3.2$. The percolation condition is:\n$$\nr \\lambda_{\\mathrm{N}} > 1 \\implies r > \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{N}}}\n$$\n$$\nr > \\frac{1}{3.2} = 0.3125\n$$\n\nFor the AMPA receptor layer, we have a mean degree of $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1.8$. The percolation condition is:\n$$\nr \\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}} > 1 \\implies r > \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}}\n$$\n$$\nr > \\frac{1}{1.8} = \\frac{1}{18/10} = \\frac{10}{18} = \\frac{5}{9}\n$$\nNumerically, $5/9 \\approx 0.5555...$\n\nFor both layers to be simultaneously above the percolation threshold, the fraction of functional sites $r$ must satisfy both inequalities:\n$$\nr > 0.3125 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad r > \\frac{5}{9}\n$$\nTo satisfy both conditions, $r$ must be greater than the larger of the two thresholds.\n$$\nr > \\max\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{N}}}, \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{A}}}\\right) = \\max\\left(0.3125, \\frac{5}{9}\\right)\n$$\nSince $5/9 \\approx 0.5556 > 0.3125$, the governing constraint is set by the AMPA receptor layer.
