A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Cable Equation**\n\nWe model the dendrite as a cylinder of radius $a$. We consider a small segment of the dendrite of infinitesimal length $dx$ located at position $x$. We must first define the electrical properties of this segment in terms of the given specific properties.\n\n1.  **Axial Resistance**: The intracellular medium (axoplasm) has a specific resistivity $R_{i}$. Current flows along the $x$-axis through a cross-sectional area $A = \\pi a^{2}$. The resistance of a segment of length $dx$ is $R_{i} \\frac{dx}{A}$. Thus, the axial resistance per unit length, denoted $r_{i}$, is:\n    $$r_{i} = \\frac{R_{i}}{\\pi a^{2}}$$\n\n2.  **Membrane Resistance**: The specific membrane resistance $R_{m}$ has units of resistance times area. For a segment of length $dx$, the surface area of the membrane is $2\\pi a dx$. The total membrane resistance of this segment is $\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a dx}$. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_{m}$, is defined as the resistance of a unit length of the membrane cylinder, which is this quantity multiplied by $dx$:\n    $$r_{m} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a}$$\n\n3.  **Membrane Capacitance**: The specific membrane capacitance $C_{m}$ has units of capacitance per area. The membrane capacitance of the segment of length $dx$ is $C_{m} (2\\pi a dx)$. Thus, the membrane capacitance per unit length, $c_{m}$, is:\n    $$c_{m} = 2\\pi a C_{m}$$\n\nNow, we apply the principle of conservation of current. Let $I_{i}(x,t)$ be the axial current flowing inside the dendrite. For the segment between $x$ and $x+dx$, the change in axial current must equal the current flowing out through the membrane, $i_{m} dx$, where $i_{m}$ is the membrane current per unit length.\n$$I_{i}(x,t) - I_{i}(x+dx, t) = i_{m}(x,t) dx$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this becomes:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial I_{i}}{\\partial x} = i_{m}$$\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the axial current $I_{i}$ is driven by the negative gradient of the intracellular voltage $V(x,t)$. The resistance for this current flow is the axial resistance per unit length, $r_{i}$.\n$$V(x) - V(x+dx) = I_{i} (r_{i} dx)$$\nIn the limit as $dx \\to 0$, this yields:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = I_{i} r_{i} \\implies I_{i} = -\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $I_{i}$ into the current conservation equation:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}\\right) = i_{m}$$\nSince $r_{i}$ is constant for a uniform cable, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = i_{m}$$\n\nThe membrane current per unit length, $i_{m}$, has two components as specified: a resistive leak component, $i_{leak}$, and a capacitive component, $i_{cap}$.\n- The leak current flows through the membrane resistance $r_{m}$: $i_{leak} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}}$, where $V$ is the voltage relative to the resting potential.\n- The capacitive current is proportional to the rate of change of voltage across the membrane capacitance $c_{m}$: $i_{cap} = c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$.\nThus, the total membrane current per unit length is:\n$$i_{m} = i_{leak} + i_{cap} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}} + c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $i_{m}$ back into our differential equation gives the cable equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{V}{r_{m}} + c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nTo match the requested form, we can write this as:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{r_{i}}{r_{m}} V + r_{i} c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\n\n**Identification of $\\lambda$ and $\\tau_m$**\nThe canonical form of the one-dimensional cable equation is:\n$$\\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + V$$\nRearranging our derived equation by multiplying by $r_{m}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} \\frac{\\partial^{2}V}{\\partial x^{2}} = V + r_{m} c_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nBy comparing this to the canonical form, we can identify the space constant $\\lambda$ and the time constant $\\tau_m$.\n$$\\lambda^{2} = \\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_m = r_{m} c_{m}$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $r_{m}$, $r_{i}$, and $c_{m}$ in terms of the fundamental parameters $R_{m}$, $C_{m}$, $R_{i}$, and $a$.\n\nFor the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$:\n$$\\tau_m = r_{m} c_{m} = \\left(\\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a}\\right) (2\\pi a C_{m}) = R_{m} C_{m}$$\n\nFor the dendritic space constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda^{2} = \\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}} = \\frac{R_{m}/(2\\pi a)}{R_{i}/(\\pi a^{2})} = \\frac{R_{m}}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^{2}}{R_{i}} = \\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given the following values (converted to SI base units):\n- $a = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $R_{m} = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $R_{i} = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n- $C_{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nFirst, we compute the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$:\n$$\\tau_m = R_{m} C_{m} = (1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}) = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nTo express this in milliseconds (ms), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\tau_m = (1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{ms}/\\mathrm{s}) = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\tau_m = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nNext, we compute the dendritic space constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m} a}{2 R_{i}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{2}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2 (1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m})}}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.0}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}} = \\sqrt{0.5 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{m} = \\sqrt{50 \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$\\lambda \\approx 7.0710678... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nTo express this in millimeters (mm), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\lambda \\approx (7.0710678... \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}/\\mathrm{m}) = 0.70710678...\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $\\lambda = 0.707\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $(\\lambda, \\tau_m)$.",

The length constant is defined as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m / r_i}$, where $r_m$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_i$ is the axial resistance per unit length.\n\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\nV(z) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{z}{\\lambda}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by boundary conditions.\n\nThe problem asks us to derive the spatial attenuation factor. We model the dendrite as being infinitely long, which is a good approximation for a synapse on a long \"semi-infinite\" dendrite, as this idealization neglects reflections from the distal tips. Let's place the synaptic input at the origin of our coordinate system, $z=0$. The voltage must remain finite as $z \\to \\pm\\infty$.\nFor $z > 0$, the term $\\exp(z/\\lambda)$ becomes unbounded, so we must have $A=0$. The solution is $V(z) = B \\exp(-z/\\lambda)$.\nFor $z < 0$, the term $\\exp(-z/\\lambda)$ becomes unbounded, so we must have $B=0$. The solution is $V(z) = A \\exp(z/\\lambda)$.\n\nThe voltage profile must be continuous at the point of synaptic input, $z=0$. The voltage at this point is the local EPSP amplitude, $V_{\\mathrm{local}}$.\nSo, for $z > 0$, $V(0) = B = V_{\\mathrm{local}}$.\nAnd for $z < 0$, $V(0) = A = V_{\\mathrm{local}}$.\nThis gives the voltage profile along an infinite cable due to a local potential $V_{\\mathrm{local}}$ at $z=0$:\n$$\nV(z) = V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|z|}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation describes how the voltage decays exponentially with distance $|z|$ from the synapse. The spatial attenuation factor for a signal traveling a distance $d$ is therefore $\\exp(-d/\\lambda)$.\n\nIn the problem, the synapse is located at a distance $x$ from the soma. Thus, the voltage at the soma, $V_{\\mathrm{soma}}$, is the attenuated version of the local voltage at the synapse, $V_{\\mathrm{local}}$, after it has propagated the distance $x$.\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{soma}} = V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we apply this relationship to the two specified neurons.\nFor the Purkinje cell (P), the somatic EPSP amplitude is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{soma, P}} = V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right)\n$$\nFor the cortical neuron (C), the somatic EPSP amplitude is:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{soma, C}} = V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that $V_{\\mathrm{local}}$ is the same for both neurons.\n\nWe need to compute the ratio of the somatic EPSP amplitude in the Purkinje cell to that in the cortical neuron, which is $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{soma, P}}}{V_{\\mathrm{soma, C}}}$.\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{soma, P}}}{V_{\\mathrm{soma, C}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right)}{V_{\\mathrm{local}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $\\frac{\\exp(a)}{\\exp(b)} = \\exp(a-b)$, the ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}} - \\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} - \\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(x \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values: $x = 500\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}} = 150\\ \\mu\\text{m}$, and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}} = 250\\ \\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$\n\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} = \\frac{500\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{250\\ \\mu\\text{m}} = 2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{x}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}} = \\frac{500\\ \\mu\\text{m}}{150\\ \\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{10}{3}\n$$\nThe exponent is:\n$$\nx \\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{C}}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{P}}}\\right) = 2 - \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{6}{3} - \\frac{10}{3} = -\\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nSo, the ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right)\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} \\approx 0.263597...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.264$.

The axial resistance per unit length is $r_i = \\frac{R_i}{A} = \\frac{4 R_i}{\\pi d^2}$.\n-   The surface area per unit length is the circumference $P = \\pi d$. The membrane resistance for a unit length is $r_m = \\frac{R_m}{P} = \\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}$.\n-   The membrane capacitance per unit length is $c_m = C_m P = C_m \\pi d$.\n\nThe **characteristic spatial decay length**, $\\lambda$, governs the steady-state voltage decay. It is defined as:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m/(\\pi d)}{4 R_i/(\\pi d^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m d}{4 R_i}} $$\nThe **membrane time constant**, $\\tau_m$, governs the temporal response of the membrane voltage. It is defined as:\n$$ \\tau_m = r_m c_m = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{\\pi d}\\right) (C_m \\pi d) = R_m C_m $$\n\nThe problem states that $R_m$ decreases by a factor of $2$, while $R_i$, $d$, and $C_m$ remain constant. Let the initial state be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state by subscript $2$. Thus, $R_{m,2} = R_{m,1}/2$.\n\nWe analyze the consequences for $\\lambda$ and $\\tau_m$:\n-   **Change in $\\lambda$**: Since $\\lambda \\propto \\sqrt{R_m}$, the new space constant $\\lambda_2$ is related to the old one $\\lambda_1$ by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m,2}}{R_{m,1}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n    So, the space constant decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n-   **Change in $\\tau_m$**: Since $\\tau_m \\propto R_m$, the new time constant $\\tau_{m,2}$ is related to the old one $\\tau_{m,1}$ by:\n    $$ \\frac{\\tau_{m,2}}{\\tau_{m,1}} = \\frac{R_{m,2}}{R_{m,1}} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n    So, the time constant decreases by a factor of $2$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The characteristic spatial decay length increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, and distal synaptic efficacy at the soma improves.**\nOur derivation shows that the spatial decay length $\\lambda$ *decreases* by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. A shorter $\\lambda$ means that voltage attenuates more strongly with distance. This would make distal synapses *less* effective at influencing the soma, not improve their efficacy.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The characteristic spatial decay length decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, making distal synapses less effective at the soma for a given distance.**\nOur derivation confirms that $\\lambda$ decreases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. In steady-state, voltage from a distal input decays with distance $x$ as $\\sim e^{-x/\\lambda}$. A smaller $\\lambda$ results in a faster decay, so a smaller fraction of the voltage generated at a distal site reaches the soma. This reduces the efficacy of distal synapses.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The membrane time constant decreases by a factor of $2$, tending to shorten the local EPSP time course.**\nOur derivation confirms that $\\tau_m$ decreases by a factor of $2$. The time constant $\\tau_m$ dictates how quickly the membrane potential changes in response to current. A smaller $\\tau_m$ means the membrane charges and discharges more quickly. This leads to a faster rise and, more significantly, a faster decay of the EPSP, thereby shortening its overall duration.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For the same local synaptic current injected at a site a distance $x$ from the soma, the fraction of that current’s steady-state voltage that reaches the soma is unchanged because $R_i$ did not change.**\nThe fraction of voltage that propagates from a location $x$ to the soma (at $x=0$) is known as the voltage transfer ratio, $V_{soma}/V_{synapse}$. This ratio is a function of the distance $x$ and the space constant $\\lambda$. Since $\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_m d / 4 R_i}$ depends on $R_m$, and $R_m$ changes, $\\lambda$ must change. Therefore, the voltage transfer ratio must also change. The reasoning provided (\"because $R_i$ did not change\") is flawed, as $\\lambda$ depends on both $R_m$ and $R_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The input resistance measured at the soma decreases, so for a given distal transmembrane current the somatic voltage change is smaller, compounding the effect of spatial attenuation.**\nThe input resistance of the neuron decreases because the membrane is more \"leaky\" (lower $R_m$). For a semi-infinite cable, the input resistance is $R_{in, \\infty} = \\sqrt{r_m r_i}$, which is proportional to $\\sqrt{R_m}$. For a finite cable with a sealed end at the soma, the input resistance at the soma is $R_{in,0} = \\sqrt{r_m r_i} \\coth(L/\\lambda)$. As $R_m$ decreases, both $\\sqrt{r_m}$ and $\\lambda$ decrease. The decrease in $\\lambda$ increases the argument $L/\\lambda$, which causes $\\coth(L/\\lambda)$ to decrease (for $L>0$). Both factors lead to a decrease in $R_{in,0}$.\nThe somatic voltage change $\\Delta V_{soma}$ due to a distal synaptic current $I_{syn}$ is determined by the transfer impedance, $Z_{transfer}$, where $\\Delta V_{soma} = I_{syn} Z_{transfer}$. This transfer impedance depends on both the local input resistance at the synapse and the spatial decay, both of which decrease when $R_m$ is lowered. A lower $R_m$ means:\n1.  The local voltage depolarization at the synapse for a given current is smaller (as local input resistance is lower).\n2.  The attenuation of this voltage as it propagates to the soma is stronger (as $\\lambda$ is smaller).\nThese two effects compound to significantly reduce the somatic impact of the distal synapse. The statement accurately captures this compound effect and correctly identifies that the somatic input resistance decreases.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. With $d = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $R_i = 150 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}$, and $R_m$ halved from $2.0 \\times 10^4$ to $1.0 \\times 10^4 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$, the characteristic spatial decay length decreases from approximately $0.82 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ to approximately $0.58 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.**\nWe perform the numerical calculation for $\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_m d / 4 R_i}$. All units must be in the same system, e.g., centimeters.\n- $d = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- $R_i = 150 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}$.\n- $R_{m,1} = 2.0 \\times 10^4 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n- $R_{m,2} = 1.0 \\times 10^4 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nInitial space constant, $\\lambda_1$:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^4 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{cm})}{4 \\times (150 \\ \\Omega\\cdot \\mathrm{cm})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{600} \\ \\mathrm{cm}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{150}} \\ \\mathrm{cm} \\approx 0.08165 \\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nConverting to millimeters: $\\lambda_1 \\approx 0.8165 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, which is approximately $0.82 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nFinal space constant, $\\lambda_2$:\nWe know $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1 / \\sqrt{2}$.\n$$ \\lambda_2 \\approx \\frac{0.8165 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{0.8165 \\ \\mathrm{mm}}{1.4142} \\approx 0.5773 \\ \\mathrm{mm} $$\nThis is approximately $0.58 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The calculations corroborate the statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**G. Because the membrane time constant decreases, temporal summation of distal EPSPs at low frequencies becomes more effective at the soma.**\nA decrease in the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ means that membrane voltage decays more rapidly after a synaptic input. Temporal summation relies on the postsynaptic potential from one input persisting long enough to summate with the potential from a subsequent input. A shorter $\\tau_m$ reduces the duration of individual EPSPs, thus making it *harder* for them to summate. Therefore, a decrease in $\\tau_m$ makes temporal summation *less* effective, not more.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
