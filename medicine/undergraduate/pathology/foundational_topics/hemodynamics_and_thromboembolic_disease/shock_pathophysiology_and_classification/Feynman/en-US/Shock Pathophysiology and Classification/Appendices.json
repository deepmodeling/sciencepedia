A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematically calculating the three requested quantities: arterial oxygen content ($\\text{CaO}_2$), systemic oxygen delivery ($\\text{DO}_2$), and maximum sustainable oxygen consumption ($\\text{VO}_2$).\n\n**1. Calculation of Arterial Oxygen Content ($\\text{CaO}_{2}$)**\n\nThe arterial oxygen content is the total amount of oxygen carried in a deciliter of arterial blood. It is the sum of two components: oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin and oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma. The governing equation is:\n$$\n\\text{CaO}_2 = (\\text{O}_2 \\text{ bound to Hb}) + (\\text{O}_2 \\text{ dissolved in plasma})\n$$\nSymbolically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{CaO}_2 = (\\text{Hb} \\times k_{\\text{Hb}} \\times \\text{SaO}_2) + (\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\times \\text{PaO}_2)\n$$\nWhere:\n- $\\text{Hb} = 8\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$\n- $k_{\\text{Hb}} = 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/g}$\n- $\\text{SaO}_2 = 0.90$ (dimensionless ratio)\n- $\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} = 0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/(dL \\cdot mmHg)}$\n- $\\text{PaO}_2 = 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$\n\\text{CaO}_2 = (8\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} \\times 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/g} \\times 0.90) + (0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/(dL \\cdot mmHg)} \\times 60\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})\n$$\nCalculating each component separately:\n- Hemoglobin-bound oxygen: $8 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.90 = 9.648\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}$\n- Dissolved oxygen: $0.003 \\times 60 = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}$\n\nSumming the components gives the total arterial oxygen content:\n$$\n\\text{CaO}_2 = 9.648\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL} + 0.18\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL} = 9.828\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of Systemic Oxygen Delivery ($\\text{DO}_{2}$)**\n\nSystemic oxygen delivery is the total volume of oxygen delivered to the tissues per unit time. It is the product of the cardiac output ($\\text{CO}$) and the arterial oxygen content ($\\text{CaO}_2$).\n$$\n\\text{DO}_2 = \\text{CO} \\times \\text{CaO}_2\n$$\nThe units must be consistent. The cardiac output is given in $\\mathrm{L/min}$, while the oxygen content is in $\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}$. We must convert the cardiac output to $\\mathrm{dL/min}$ using the provided conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{dL}$.\n$$\n\\text{CO} = 4\\,\\mathrm{L/min} = 4\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{dL}}{1\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{dL/min}\n$$\nNow we can calculate $\\text{DO}_2$:\n$$\n\\text{DO}_2 = (40\\,\\mathrm{dL/min}) \\times (9.828\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{DO}_2 = 393.12\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Highest Sustainable Oxygen Consumption ($\\text{VO}_{2}$)**\n\nWhole-body oxygen consumption ($\\text{VO}_2$) is related to oxygen delivery ($\\text{DO}_2$) and the oxygen extraction ratio ($E$) by the Fick principle:\n$$\n\\text{VO}_2 = \\text{DO}_2 \\times E\n$$\nThe problem asks for the highest $\\text{VO}_2$ that can be sustained without the body entering a state of supply-dependent oxygen consumption. This critical point occurs when the oxygen extraction ratio reaches its maximum physiologically sustainable value, given as $E_{\\max} = 0.60$. Therefore, we calculate the critical oxygen consumption, $\\text{VO}_{2,\\text{crit}}$, as:\n$$\n\\text{VO}_{2,\\text{crit}} = \\text{DO}_2 \\times E_{\\max}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $\\text{DO}_2$ and the given value for $E_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\text{VO}_{2,\\text{crit}} = (393.12\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}) \\times 0.60\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VO}_{2,\\text{crit}} = 235.872\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}\n$$\n\n**Final Results and Rounding**\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical results to be rounded to three significant figures.\n- $\\text{CaO}_2 = 9.828\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL} \\approx 9.83\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL}$\n- $\\text{DO}_2 = 393.12\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min} \\approx 393\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}$\n- $\\text{VO}_2 = 235.872\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min} \\approx 236\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/min}$\n\nThe final answer should report these three values in the specified order.",

Assuming that zero circulating volume corresponds to zero stroke volume, $\\text{SV}$ is directly proportional to the total blood volume. Thus, the ratio of post-hemorrhage stroke volume, $\\text{SV}_p$, to baseline stroke volume, $\\text{SV}_b$, is equal to the ratio of their respective blood volumes:\n$$\\frac{\\text{SV}_p}{\\text{SV}_b} = \\frac{\\text{TBV}_p}{\\text{TBV}_b} = 0.70$$\nTherefore, $\\text{SV}_p = 0.70 \\times \\text{SV}_b$.\n\nAccording to assumption (ii), the heart rate remains unchanged: $\\text{HR}_p = \\text{HR}_b$.\n\nWe can now calculate the post-hemorrhage cardiac output, $\\text{CO}_p$:\n$$\\text{CO}_p = \\text{HR}_p \\times \\text{SV}_p = \\text{HR}_b \\times (0.70 \\times \\text{SV}_b) = 0.70 \\times (\\text{HR}_b \\times \\text{SV}_b) = 0.70 \\times \\text{CO}_b$$\n\nThe fractional decrease in cardiac output is defined as $\\frac{\\text{CO}_b - \\text{CO}_p}{\\text{CO}_b}$.\n$$\\text{Fractional decrease in } \\text{CO} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{CO}_p}{\\text{CO}_b} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\n\nNext, we determine the fractional decrease in oxygen delivery, $DO_2$. Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac output and the arterial oxygen content, $CaO_2$.\n$$DO_2 = \\text{CO} \\times CaO_2$$\nThe arterial oxygen content is calculated as:\n$$CaO_2 = (k \\times \\text{Hb} \\times \\text{SaO}_2) + (\\alpha \\times \\text{PaO}_2)$$\nwhere $k$ is the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin (approximately $1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,O_2\\mathrm{/g}\\,Hb$) and $\\alpha$ is the solubility of oxygen in plasma (approximately $0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,O_2\\mathrm{/dL/mmHg}$).\nAccording to assumption (iv), $\\text{Hb}$, $\\text{SaO}_2$, and $\\text{PaO}_2$ are unchanged immediately after the hemorrhage. This implies that the arterial oxygen content is also unchanged: $CaO_{2,p} = CaO_{2,b}$.\n\nThe ratio of post-hemorrhage oxygen delivery to baseline oxygen delivery is therefore:\n$$\\frac{DO_{2,p}}{DO_{2,b}} = \\frac{\\text{CO}_p \\times CaO_{2,p}}{\\text{CO}_b \\times CaO_{2,b}} = \\frac{\\text{CO}_p}{\\text{CO}_b} = 0.70$$\nThe fractional decrease in oxygen delivery is:\n$$\\text{Fractional decrease in } DO_2 = 1 - \\frac{DO_{2,p}}{DO_{2,b}} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$$\n\nFinally, we compute the post-hemorrhage shock index, $\\text{SI}_p$, defined as $\\frac{\\text{HR}_p}{\\text{SAP}_p}$. We have $\\text{HR}_p = \\text{HR}_b = 70\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. We need to find the post-hemorrhage systolic arterial pressure, $\\text{SAP}_p$.\n\nThe relationship between mean arterial pressure ($\\text{MAP}$), cardiac output ($\\text{CO}$), and systemic vascular resistance ($\\text{SVR}$) is $\\text{MAP} = \\text{CO} \\times \\text{SVR}$.\nAccording to assumption (iii), $\\text{SVR}$ is unchanged, so $\\text{SVR}_p = \\text{SVR}_b$.\nThe ratio of post-hemorrhage $\\text{MAP}$ to baseline $\\text{MAP}$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{MAP}_p}{\\text{MAP}_b} = \\frac{\\text{CO}_p \\times \\text{SVR}_p}{\\text{CO}_b \\times \\text{SVR}_b} = \\frac{\\text{CO}_p}{\\text{CO}_b} = 0.70$$\nThus, $\\text{MAP}_p = 0.70 \\times \\text{MAP}_b$.\n\nAccording to assumption (v), $\\text{SAP}$ is proportional to $\\text{MAP}$, i.e., $\\text{SAP} = c \\cdot \\text{MAP}$ for some constant $c$. This proportionality is preserved from baseline.\n$$\\frac{\\text{SAP}_p}{\\text{MAP}_p} = \\frac{\\text{SAP}_b}{\\text{MAP}_b}$$\nRearranging for $\\text{SAP}_p$:\n$$\\text{SAP}_p = \\text{SAP}_b \\times \\frac{\\text{MAP}_p}{\\text{MAP}_b} = \\text{SAP}_b \\times 0.70$$\nUsing the given baseline systolic pressure, $\\text{SAP}_b = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$:\n$$\\text{SAP}_p = 120\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.70 = 84\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nIt is not necessary to calculate the absolute value of $\\text{MAP}_b$.\n\nWe can now calculate the post-hemorrhage shock index, $\\text{SI}_p$:\n$$\\text{SI}_p = \\frac{\\text{HR}_p}{\\text{SAP}_p} = \\frac{70\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}{84\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}} = \\frac{70}{84} = \\frac{5}{6}$$\nAs a decimal, $\\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333...$.\n\nThe three requested quantities are:\n1.  Fractional decrease in cardiac output: $0.30$\n2.  Fractional decrease in oxygen delivery: $0.30$\n3.  Post-hemorrhage shock index: $\\frac{5}{6}$\n\nRounding each entry to three significant figures, we get:\n1.  Fractional decrease in $\\text{CO}$: $0.300$\n2.  Fractional decrease in $DO_2$: $0.300$\n3.  Post-hemorrhage shock index: $0.833$\n\nThese are reported as a single row vector.",
