This practice introduces you to this quantitative approach by using data from immunohistochemistry (IHC), a technique that visualizes specific proteins in tissue. You will learn to calculate H-scores from raw cell counts and then use these scores to derive a logical index that classifies the type of metaplasia present . This exercise demonstrates how to transform qualitative staining patterns into an objective metric for distinguishing between intestinal and gastric phenotypes, a critical step in evaluating biopsies from the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "problem": "A gastric biopsy is evaluated by Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mucin phenotype using four markers: Mucin 2 (MUC2), Transcription factor Caudal Type Homeobox 2 (CDX2), Mucin 5AC (MUC5AC), and Mucin 6 (MUC6). For each marker, a total of $N$ epithelial cells are scored by intensity on a $0$ to $3$ ordinal scale, where $0$ indicates no staining and $3$ indicates strong staining. Assume $N$ is the same for each marker and equals $N = 200$.\n\nUse the standard Histochemical score (H-score) definition: the H-score for a marker is the sum over intensity categories of the intensity multiplied by the percentage of cells at that intensity, that is, if $P_{i}$ is the percentage of cells staining at intensity $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$ (with $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} P_{i} = 100$), then the H-score is $\\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\times P_{i}$.\n\nThe raw counts of cells at each intensity for this case are:\n- MUC2: $0$: $0$ cells, $1$: $60$ cells, $2$: $60$ cells, $3$: $80$ cells.\n- CDX2: $0$: $10$ cells, $1$: $70$ cells, $2$: $50$ cells, $3$: $70$ cells.\n- MUC5AC: $0$: $60$ cells, $1$: $40$ cells, $2$: $40$ cells, $3$: $60$ cells.\n- MUC6: $0$: $110$ cells, $1$: $30$ cells, $2$: $30$ cells, $3$: $30$ cells.\n\nFrom first principles, construct a quantitative mucin subtype index $S$ that contrasts the intestinal phenotype (represented by the pair of intestinal markers MUC2 and CDX2) against the gastric phenotype (represented by the pair of gastric markers MUC5AC and MUC6) under the following constraints grounded in biological interpretation and measurement invariances:\n1. $S$ depends only on the aggregated intestinal signal $I$ and aggregated gastric signal $G$ formed from the H-scores of their respective marker sets.\n2. $S$ is bounded between $-1$ and $+1$; $S=+1$ corresponds to a purely intestinal phenotype ($G=0$, $I>0$), $S=-1$ corresponds to a purely gastric phenotype ($I=0$, $G>0$), and $S=0$ corresponds to equal aggregated signals ($I=G>0$).\n3. $S$ is invariant under common positive rescaling of $I$ and $G$ (that is, replacing $(I,G)$ by $(\\alpha I,\\alpha G)$ for any $\\alpha>0$ leaves $S$ unchanged).\n4. $S$ changes sign upon exchanging the roles of intestinal and gastric aggregates (that is, swapping $I$ and $G$ multiplies $S$ by $-1$).\n5. $S$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function of the ratio $I/G$ for $G>0$.\n\nUsing these constraints, derive an explicit analytic expression for $S$ in terms of $I$ and $G$, compute $S$ for the data above, and (in your reasoning only) decide whether the mucin profile is more consistent with intestinal metaplasia, gastric-type metaplasia, or a mixed pattern using the following rule-of-thumb: $S > 0.2$ indicates intestinal metaplasia, $S < -0.2$ indicates gastric-type metaplasia, and values between $-0.2$ and $0.2$ indicate a mixed pattern.\n\nReport only the numerical value of the computed index $S$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the field of pathology, mathematically well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the Histochemical score (H-score) for each of the four markers. The H-score is defined as $H = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\times P_{i}$, where $P_{i}$ is the percentage of cells staining at intensity $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The total number of cells scored for each marker is $N = 200$. The percentage $P_{i}$ can be expressed in terms of the raw cell count $n_{i}$ at intensity $i$ as $P_{i} = \\frac{n_{i}}{N} \\times 100$.\n\nSubstituting this into the H-score formula:\n$$ H = \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\left( \\frac{n_{i}}{N} \\times 100 \\right) = \\frac{100}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot n_{i} $$\nGiven $N = 200$, the pre-factor is $\\frac{100}{200} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, the formula simplifies to:\n$$ H = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=0}^{3} i \\cdot n_{i} $$\n\nUsing the provided raw cell counts, we calculate the H-score for each marker:\n\n1.  **MUC2 (Intestinal marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=0$, $n_{1}=60$, $n_{2}=60$, $n_{3}=80$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 0 + 1 \\times 60 + 2 \\times 60 + 3 \\times 80) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 60 + 120 + 240) = \\frac{1}{2} (420) = 210 $$\n\n2.  **CDX2 (Intestinal marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=10$, $n_{1}=70$, $n_{2}=50$, $n_{3}=70$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{CDX2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 10 + 1 \\times 70 + 2 \\times 50 + 3 \\times 70) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 70 + 100 + 210) = \\frac{1}{2} (380) = 190 $$\n\n3.  **MUC5AC (Gastric marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=60$, $n_{1}=40$, $n_{2}=40$, $n_{3}=60$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC5AC}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 60 + 1 \\times 40 + 2 \\times 40 + 3 \\times 60) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 40 + 80 + 180) = \\frac{1}{2} (300) = 150 $$\n\n4.  **MUC6 (Gastric marker):**\n    Counts are $n_{0}=110$, $n_{1}=30$, $n_{2}=30$, $n_{3}=30$.\n    $$ H_{\\text{MUC6}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0 \\times 110 + 1 \\times 30 + 2 \\times 30 + 3 \\times 30) = \\frac{1}{2} (0 + 30 + 60 + 90) = \\frac{1}{2} (180) = 90 $$\n\nNext, we aggregate these scores into a total intestinal signal $I$ and a total gastric signal $G$. As the problem asks to construct the index from first principles without specifying the aggregation method, we choose summation as the most direct and simple approach.\n$$ I = H_{\\text{MUC2}} + H_{\\text{CDX2}} = 210 + 190 = 400 $$\n$$ G = H_{\\text{MUC5AC}} + H_{\\text{MUC6}} = 150 + 90 = 240 $$\n\nNow we derive the analytic expression for the mucin subtype index $S$ in terms of $I$ and $G$ using the five given constraints.\n1.  $S$ depends only on $I$ and $G$.\n2.  $-1 \\le S \\le +1$. $S(I>0, G=0) = +1$, $S(I=0, G>0) = -1$, and $S(I=G>0) = 0$.\n3.  $S(\\alpha I, \\alpha G) = S(I, G)$ for any $\\alpha > 0$.\n4.  $S(I, G) = -S(G, I)$.\n5.  $S$ is a continuous, strictly increasing function of the ratio $I/G$ (for $G>0$).\n\nConstraint 3 (scale invariance) implies that $S$ must be a function of the ratio of its arguments. Let $S(I,G) = f(I/G)$. Let $r = I/G$.\n\nWe translate the other constraints into properties of $f(r)$:\n- From constraint 2:\n  - $S(I>0, G=0)$ corresponds to $r \\to \\infty$, so $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} f(r) = 1$.\n  - $S(I=0, G>0)$ corresponds to $r = 0$, so $f(0) = -1$.\n  - $S(I=G>0)$ corresponds to $r = 1$, so $f(1) = 0$.\n- From constraint 4: $S(I,G) = -S(G,I)$ implies $f(I/G) = -f(G/I)$, or $f(r) = -f(1/r)$.\n- From constraint 5: $f(r)$ is continuous and strictly increasing for $r>0$.\n\nWe seek the simplest functional form satisfying these conditions. A rational function is a prime candidate. Let's try to construct such a function. The condition $f(1)=0$ suggests a factor of $(r-1)$ in the numerator. The condition $f(0)=-1$ suggests a simple form like $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{g(r)}$ with $g(0)=1$. The condition $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} f(r) = 1$ suggests that the numerator and denominator have the same degree in $r$. A simple choice fulfilling these is $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{r+1}$.\n\nLet's verify this function against all constraints:\n- $S(I,G) = f(I/G) = \\frac{I/G-1}{I/G+1} = \\frac{I-G}{I+G}$. This depends only on $I$ and $G$. (Constraint 1)\n- For $I, G \\ge 0$, if $I > G$, $S>0$. If $I < G$, $S<0$. The maximum value occurs as $G/I \\to 0$ (i.e., $G=0, I>0$), giving $S=1$. The minimum occurs as $I/G \\to 0$ (i.e., $I=0, G>0$), giving $S=-1$. If $I=G$, $S=0$. The range is $[-1, 1]$. (Constraint 2)\n- $S(\\alpha I, \\alpha G) = \\frac{\\alpha I - \\alpha G}{\\alpha I + \\alpha G} = \\frac{\\alpha(I-G)}{\\alpha(I+G)} = \\frac{I-G}{I+G} = S(I,G)$. (Constraint 3)\n- $S(G,I) = \\frac{G-I}{G+I} = -\\frac{I-G}{I+G} = -S(I,G)$. (Constraint 4)\n- The derivative of $f(r) = \\frac{r-1}{r+1}$ is $f'(r) = \\frac{(1)(r+1) - (r-1)(1)}{(r+1)^2} = \\frac{2}{(r+1)^2}$. For $r=I/G > 0$, $f'(r)>0$, so the function is strictly increasing. It is also continuous for $r \\ge 0$. (Constraint 5)\n\nThe function $S(I,G) = \\frac{I-G}{I+G}$ uniquely satisfies all the required properties in the simplest possible form and is the derived analytic expression for the index.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of $S$ for this case using $I=400$ and $G=240$:\n$$ S = \\frac{400 - 240}{400 + 240} = \\frac{160}{640} = \\frac{16}{64} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\n\nThe problem asks for a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures, which is $0.2500$.\n\nFor reasoning purposes, we use the interpretation rule provided. Since $S = 0.25 > 0.2$, the mucin profile is most consistent with intestinal metaplasia.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a composite dysplasia score, $S$, from given histopathological data and its subsequent classification into a dysplasia grade. The process involves several steps, beginning with the calculation of sample means from the observed data, followed by standardization of these means against provided normal reference values, weighting these standardized scores, and finally combining them into a single composite score.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sample means for the two features: atypical mitoses per high-power field (HPF) and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio.\n\nThe observed data for atypical mitoses per HPF across $10$ fields are: $[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]$.\nThe number of observations is $N = 10$.\nThe sample mean for atypical mitoses, denoted as $\\bar{x}_m$, is the sum of the observations divided by the number of observations:\n$$\n\\bar{x}_m = \\frac{0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1}{10} = \\frac{5}{10} = 0.50\n$$\n\nThe observed data for the N:C ratio across the same $10$ HPFs are: $[0.64, 0.68, 0.66, 0.69, 0.65, 0.67, 0.70, 0.66, 0.68, 0.67]$.\nThe sample mean for the N:C ratio, denoted as $\\bar{x}_n$, is calculated similarly:\n$$\n\\bar{x}_n = \\frac{0.64 + 0.68 + 0.66 + 0.69 + 0.65 + 0.67 + 0.70 + 0.66 + 0.68 + 0.67}{10} = \\frac{6.70}{10} = 0.67\n$$\n\nNext, we standardize the deviation of these sample means from their respective normal reference means.

The process is modeled as a two-step sequence: LGD $\\rightarrow$ HGD $\\rightarrow$ Carcinoma. Let $T_1$ be the random variable representing the waiting time from LGD to high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and let $T_2$ be the random variable representing the waiting time from HGD to carcinoma. The total time, $T$, from LGD to carcinoma is the sum of these two waiting times: $T = T_1 + T_2$. The problem states that $T_1$ and $T_2$ are independent.\n\nWe are asked to find the expectation of the total time, $E[T]$. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$E[T] = E[T_1 + T_2] = E[T_1] + E[T_2]$$\nThe task thus reduces to finding the expected waiting time for each step and summing them. The problem requires a derivation from foundational principles, starting with the definition of the hazard rate.\n\nLet us consider a general non-negative continuous random variable $T_{wait}$ representing a waiting time, governed by a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$. The hazard rate, $h(t)$, is defined as the instantaneous conditional probability of an event (e.g., disease progression) at time $t$, given that the event has not yet occurred. It is related to the probability density function (PDF) $f(t)$ and the survival function $S(t) = P(T_{wait} \\ge t)$ by:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$$\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is related to its PDF $f(t)$ by $f(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}$. Substituting this into the hazard rate definition gives:\n$$h(t) = \\frac{-\\frac{dS(t)}{dt}}{S(t)} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t))$$\nIn this problem, the hazard rate is a constant, $h(t) = \\lambda$. Therefore, we have the differential equation:\n$$-\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) = \\lambda$$\nWe can solve this for $S(t)$ by integrating both sides with respect to time from $0$ to a variable upper limit $\\tau$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\tau} -\\frac{d}{dt} \\ln(S(t)) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\lambda dt$$\n$$-[\\ln(S(t))]_0^\\tau = \\lambda \\tau$$\n$$-(\\ln(S(\\tau)) - \\ln(S(0))) = \\lambda \\tau$$\nFor a waiting-time process, the probability of having survived to time $t=0$ is $1$, so $S(0) = P(T_{wait} \\ge 0) = 1$. Consequently, $\\ln(S(0)) = \\ln(1) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$-\\ln(S(\\tau)) = \\lambda \\tau \\implies \\ln(S(\\tau)) = -\\lambda \\tau$$\nExponentiating both sides yields the survival function:\n$$S(\\tau) = \\exp(-\\lambda \\tau)$$\nReplacing the dummy variable $\\tau$ with $t$, we have $S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$. This is the survival function of the exponential distribution.\n\nNext, we derive the PDF $f(t)$ from the survival function:\n$$f(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{d}{dt} \\exp(-\\lambda t) = -(-\\lambda) \\exp(-\\lambda t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis is the PDF of the exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$, for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we derive the expected value, $E[T_{wait}]$, for this distribution from its foundational definition.

At $t=0$, the term is $0$. At $t \\to \\infty$, we evaluate the limit $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{t}{\\exp(\\lambda t)}$.
