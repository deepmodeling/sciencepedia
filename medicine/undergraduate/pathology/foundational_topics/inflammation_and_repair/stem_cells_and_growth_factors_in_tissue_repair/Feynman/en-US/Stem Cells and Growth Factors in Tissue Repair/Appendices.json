This process, known as paracrine signaling, is inherently local. This practice explores the fundamental biophysical limits of this communication by modeling how a growth factor spreads from a single source cell, balancing the outward push of diffusion with constant removal by degradation. By solving the governing equation, you will derive the steady-state concentration gradient and uncover the characteristic length scale that defines the signaling microenvironment. ",

            "problem": "A single activated stem cell embedded in a thin planar tissue secretes a pro-repair growth factor at a constant rate. In isotropic tissue, transport of soluble factors is governed by Fickian diffusion and first-order degradation. Let $c(\\mathbf{r})$ denote the steady-state concentration of the growth factor at planar position $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, let $D>0$ be the diffusion coefficient, and let $k>0$ be the first-order degradation rate constant. The secretion by the single cell located at the origin is modeled as a point source of strength $Q>0$, so that the source term is $S(\\mathbf{r}) = Q \\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$ is the Dirac delta function. Starting from Fick’s law of diffusion and mass conservation, the governing steady-state partial differential equation (PDE) is\n$$\nD\\,\\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) - k\\,c(\\mathbf{r}) + Q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) = 0,\n$$\nwith the physical boundary condition $c(\\mathbf{r}) \\to 0$ as $|\\mathbf{r}| \\to \\infty$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a standard application of partial differential equations to a biophysical model of diffusion and reaction, which is valid and solvable.\n\nWe begin with the governing steady-state partial differential equation (PDE) in two dimensions:\n$$\nD\\,\\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) - k\\,c(\\mathbf{r}) + Q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) = 0\n$$\nHere, $c(\\mathbf{r})$ is the concentration, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, $k$ is the degradation rate constant, $Q$ is the source strength, and $\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$ is the two-dimensional Dirac delta function.\n\nThe problem assumes radial symmetry, so the concentration $c$ depends only on the distance $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$ from the origin, i.e., $c(\\mathbf{r}) = c(r)$. In two-dimensional polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$, the Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ is given by $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} + \\frac{1}{r^2}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\theta^2}$. Due to radial symmetry, the derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is zero, so the Laplacian simplifies to $\\nabla^2 c(r) = \\frac{d^2c}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc}{dr}$.\n\nFor any position $r > 0$, the source term $\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$ is zero. The PDE thus becomes a homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\nD\\left(\\frac{d^2c}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) - k\\,c(r) = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc}{dr} - \\frac{k}{D}c(r) = 0\n$$\nLet us define a constant $\\lambda = \\sqrt{k/D}$. The equation is then:\n$$\nr^2\\frac{d^2c}{dr^2} + r\\frac{dc}{dr} - (\\lambda r)^2 c(r) = 0\n$$\nThis is the modified Bessel's equation of order zero. The general solution is a linear combination of the modified Bessel functions of the first kind, $I_0(\\lambda r)$, and the second kind, $K_0(\\lambda r)$:\n$$\nc(r) = A\\,I_0(\\lambda r) + B\\,K_0(\\lambda r)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined.\n\nWe must apply the boundary condition $c(r) \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. We examine the asymptotic behavior of the Bessel functions for large arguments:\n- $I_0(z) \\sim \\frac{e^z}{\\sqrt{2\\pi z}}$ as $z \\to \\infty$, which diverges.\n- $K_0(z) \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{2z}} e^{-z}$ as $z \\to \\infty$, which converges to zero.\n\nTo satisfy the boundary condition, the coefficient of the divergent term must be zero. Therefore, we must have $A=0$. The solution for $r>0$ must take the form:\n$$\nc(r) = B\\,K_0(\\lambda r) = B\\,K_0\\left(r\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\n\nTo determine the constant $B$, we use the information about the point source at $r=0$, as suggested in the problem statement. We integrate the full, inhomogeneous PDE over a small disk, $\\Omega_\\epsilon$, of radius $\\epsilon$ centered at the origin.\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\left( D\\,\\nabla^2 c - k\\,c + Q\\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\right) d^2\\mathbf{r} = 0\n$$\nWe can separate this into three terms:\n$$\nD \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\nabla^2 c \\, d^2\\mathbf{r} - k \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} c \\, d^2\\mathbf{r} + Q \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^2\\mathbf{r} = 0\n$$\nBy the definition of the Dirac delta function, $\\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) \\, d^2\\mathbf{r} = 1$. The third term is simply $Q$.\n\nFor the first term, we apply the 2D divergence theorem (which is a form of Green's theorem), $\\int_A \\nabla^2 c \\, dA = \\oint_{\\partial A} (\\nabla c) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\, dL$. The boundary $\\partial \\Omega_\\epsilon$ is a circle of radius $\\epsilon$. The outward unit normal is $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$, and the gradient in polar coordinates for a radial function is $\\nabla c = \\frac{dc}{dr}\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. The line element is $dL = \\epsilon \\, d\\theta$.\n$$\nD \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\nabla^2 c \\, d^2\\mathbf{r} = D \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega_\\epsilon} \\frac{dc}{dr} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\, dL = D \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{dc}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\epsilon} (\\epsilon \\, d\\theta) = 2\\pi\\epsilon D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\epsilon}\n$$\nThe integrated equation is now:\n$$\n2\\pi\\epsilon D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\epsilon} - k \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\epsilon c(r) \\, r \\, dr \\, d\\theta + Q = 0\n$$\n$$\n2\\pi\\epsilon D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\epsilon} - 2\\pi k \\int_0^\\epsilon c(r) \\, r \\, dr + Q = 0\n$$\nNow we take the limit as $\\epsilon \\to 0$. To do this, we need the behavior of our solution $c(r) = B\\,K_0(\\lambda r)$ and its derivative for small arguments.\nThe small-argument asymptotic forms are $K_0(z) \\approx -\\ln(z)$ and $K_1(z) \\approx 1/z$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dc}{dr} = B \\frac{d}{dr}K_0(\\lambda r) = B(-\\lambda K_1(\\lambda r))$.\nFor small $r$, $\\frac{dc}{dr} \\approx B(-\\lambda) \\frac{1}{\\lambda r} = -\\frac{B}{r}$.\nSubstituting this into the first term:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} 2\\pi\\epsilon D \\frac{dc}{dr}\\bigg|_{r=\\epsilon} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} 2\\pi\\epsilon D \\left(-\\frac{B}{\\epsilon}\\right) = -2\\pi D B\n$$\nFor the second term, we have $c(r) \\approx -B \\ln(\\lambda r)$ for small $r$. The integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\epsilon c(r) r \\, dr \\approx -B \\int_0^\\epsilon r \\ln(\\lambda r) \\, dr = -B \\left[ \\frac{r^2}{2}\\ln(\\lambda r) - \\frac{r^2}{4} \\right]_0^\\epsilon\n$$\nThis evaluates to $-B \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\ln(\\lambda \\epsilon) - \\frac{\\epsilon^2}{4} \\right)$, which goes to $0$ as $\\epsilon \\to 0$ (since $\\lim_{x\\to0} x^2\\ln x = 0$).\nThus, in the limit $\\epsilon \\to 0$, the integrated equation becomes:\n$$\n-2\\pi D B - 0 + Q = 0\n$$\nSolving for $B$ yields:\n$$\nB = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi D}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $c(r)$:\n$$\nc(r) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi D} K_0\\left(r\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state concentration profile.\n\nThe characteristic length scale of this system is found in the argument of the Bessel function, $r\\sqrt{k/D}$. For the argument to be dimensionless, the term $\\sqrt{k/D}$ must have units of inverse length. Therefore, the characteristic length scale, let's call it $L$, is:\n$$\nL = \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{k}}\n$$\nThis length scale is highly relevant to paracrine signaling. It represents a balance between two competing processes: diffusion, which transports the growth factor away from the source, and degradation, which removes it from the system. The value of $L$ defines the spatial range over which the growth factor concentration is significant. For distances $r \\gg L$, the concentration decays exponentially, meaning the signal is effectively localized within a radius of a few multiples of $L$. In tissue repair, this is crucial for ensuring that pro-repair signals act locally at the site of injury without causing unintended effects, such as fibrosis or abnormal proliferation, in distant, healthy tissue. The scale $L$ thus defines the effective radius of the local signaling microenvironment created by the stem cell.",

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe task is to derive the equilibrium fraction of occupied receptors and compute its value. The derivation begins from the law of mass action for the specified binding equilibrium.\n\nThe reversible binding of a ligand, $L$ (EGF), to a receptor, $R$ (EGFR), to form a receptor-ligand complex, $RL$, is described by the reaction:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the free reactants to the concentration of the complex:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is conserved.
