This first exercise demonstrates how to quantitatively link a systemic patient factor, such as anemia, to the local availability of oxygen. By calculating the arterial oxygen content, you will see precisely how a lower hemoglobin concentration impairs the blood's capacity to transport oxygen, a foundational concept for understanding why anemic patients often experience delayed wound healing .",

            "problem": "A surgical wound’s early healing depends critically on oxygen availability at the tissue level. Consider two otherwise similar patients whose arterial blood is supplying a healing wound. Assume that tissue oxygen delivery is proportional to arterial oxygen content, which is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma. Use the following well-tested biophysical facts: each gram of hemoglobin binds approximately $1.34$ mL of oxygen when fully saturated, and the solubility of oxygen in blood plasma is approximately $0.0031$ mL $\\mathrm{O_2}$ per dL blood per mmHg of oxygen partial pressure (Henry’s law). Let the variables be hemoglobin concentration $\\mathrm{Hb}$ (g/dL), arterial oxygen saturation $\\mathrm{SaO_2}$ (fraction), and arterial oxygen partial pressure $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$ (mmHg). \n\nPatient A is anemic with $\\mathrm{Hb}=9$ g/dL, while Patient B has $\\mathrm{Hb}=14$ g/dL. Both have the same $\\mathrm{SaO_2}=0.95$ and $\\mathrm{PaO_2}=80$ mmHg. Starting from the definition that total arterial oxygen content equals the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma, first construct an analytical expression for the oxygen content in mL $\\mathrm{O_2}$/dL as a function of $\\mathrm{Hb}$, $\\mathrm{SaO_2}$, and $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$. Then use it to compute the absolute decrease in arterial oxygen content (in mL $\\mathrm{O_2}$/dL) from Patient B to Patient A.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single number in mL $\\mathrm{O_2}$/dL and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of respiratory physiology, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific or mathematical logic.\n\nThe task is to first construct an analytical expression for the total arterial oxygen content ($C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$) and then use it to calculate the absolute decrease in this content between Patient B and Patient A.\n\nThe total arterial oxygen content, $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$, measured in milliliters of $\\mathrm{O}_2$ per deciliter of blood (mL $\\mathrm{O}_2$/dL), is the sum of two components: the oxygen bound to hemoglobin ($C_{Hb\\mathrm{O}_2}$) and the oxygen dissolved in blood plasma ($C_{p\\mathrm{O}_2}$).\n$$C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{Hb\\mathrm{O}_2} + C_{p\\mathrm{O}_2}$$\n\nFirst, let us formulate the expression for the oxygen bound to hemoglobin, $C_{Hb\\mathrm{O}_2}$. This quantity is the product of the hemoglobin concentration ($\\mathrm{Hb}$), the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin, and the arterial oxygen saturation ($\\mathrm{SaO_2}$).\nThe given values are:\n- Hemoglobin concentration, $\\mathrm{Hb}$, in g/dL.\n- Oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin, which we will denote as $k_{Hb}$. The problem states this is $k_{Hb} = 1.34$ mL $\\mathrm{O}_2$/g Hb.\n- Arterial oxygen saturation, $\\mathrm{SaO_2}$, which is a dimensionless fraction.\n\nTherefore, the oxygen bound to hemoglobin is:\n$$C_{Hb\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\mathrm{Hb} \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}$$\nThe units are $(\\text{g/dL}) \\times (\\text{mL/g}) \\times (\\text{dimensionless}) = \\text{mL/dL}$, which is correct.\n\nSecond, we formulate the expression for the oxygen dissolved in plasma, $C_{p\\mathrm{O}_2}$. According to Henry's law, this is the product of the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood ($\\mathrm{PaO_2}$) and the solubility of oxygen in plasma.\nThe given values are:\n- Arterial oxygen partial pressure, $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$, in mmHg.\n- Solubility of oxygen, which we will denote as $k_{sol}$. The problem states this is $k_{sol} = 0.0031$ mL $\\mathrm{O}_2$/(dL $\\cdot$ mmHg).\n\nTherefore, the dissolved oxygen is:\n$$C_{p\\mathrm{O}_2} = \\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol}$$\nThe units are $(\\text{mmHg}) \\times (\\text{mL/(dL}\\cdot\\text{mmHg)}) = \\text{mL/dL}$, which is also correct.\n\nCombining these two components gives the general analytical expression for the total arterial oxygen content, which is the first part of the problem's requirement:\n$$C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = (\\mathrm{Hb} \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol})$$\n\nNow, we must compute the absolute decrease in arterial oxygen content from Patient B to Patient A. This is the difference $\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2, B} - C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2, A}$.\nLet the variables for Patient A be $\\mathrm{Hb}_A$, $\\mathrm{SaO_2}_A$, and $\\mathrm{PaO_2}_A$.\nLet the variables for Patient B be $\\mathrm{Hb}_B$, $\\mathrm{SaO_2}_B$, and $\\mathrm{PaO_2}_B$.\n\nThe difference is:\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = [(\\mathrm{Hb}_B \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}_B) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2}_B \\times k_{sol})] - [(\\mathrm{Hb}_A \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}_A) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2}_A \\times k_{sol})]$$\n\nThe problem states that both patients have the same arterial saturation and partial pressure of oxygen:\n$\\mathrm{SaO_2}_A = \\mathrm{SaO_2}_B = 0.95$\n$\\mathrm{PaO_2}_A = \\mathrm{PaO_2}_B = 80$ mmHg\n\nLet's denote the common saturation as $\\mathrm{SaO_2}$ and the common partial pressure as $\\mathrm{PaO_2}$. Substituting these into the difference equation:\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = [(\\mathrm{Hb}_B \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol})] - [(\\mathrm{Hb}_A \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol})]$$\n\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = (\\mathrm{Hb}_B \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}) - (\\mathrm{Hb}_A \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}) + (\\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol}) - (\\mathrm{PaO_2} \\times k_{sol})$$\n\nThe dissolved oxygen terms cancel out, simplifying the expression significantly:\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = (\\mathrm{Hb}_B - \\mathrm{Hb}_A) \\times k_{Hb} \\times \\mathrm{SaO_2}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the numerical values into this simplified expression.\n- $\\mathrm{Hb}_A = 9$ g/dL\n- $\\mathrm{Hb}_B = 14$ g/dL\n- $k_{Hb} = 1.34$ mL/g\n- $\\mathrm{SaO_2} = 0.95$\n\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = (14 - 9) \\times 1.34 \\times 0.95$$\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 5 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.95$$\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 6.7 \\times 0.95$$\n$$\\Delta C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 6.365$$\n\nThe absolute decrease in arterial oxygen content is $6.365$ mL $\\mathrm{O}_2$/dL. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $6.365$ already has exactly four significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.",

The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{synth} - R_{degrad}\n$$\n\nThe term on the right-hand side, $R_{synth} - R_{degrad}$, represents the net collagen deposition rate, which we can denote as $R_{net}$.\n$$\nR_{net} = R_{synth} - R_{degrad}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$R_{synth} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{day})$\n$R_{degrad} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{day})$\n\nThe net collagen deposition rate is:\n$$\nR_{net} = 5 - 2 = 3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/(\\mathrm{cm}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{day})\n$$\nThis is the first requested value.\n\nNow, we solve for the time required to reach the threshold. The differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = R_{net} = 3\n$$\nSince $R_{net}$ is constant, we can solve this equation by direct integration with respect to time $t$. We integrate from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$, and from the initial collagen content $C(0)$ to the content $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} R_{net} \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\nC(t) - C(0) = R_{net} (t - 0)\n$$\n\nGiven the initial condition $C(0) = 0$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nC(t) = R_{net} \\cdot t\n$$\nThis equation describes the linear increase of collagen content over time.\n\nWe need to find the time, $t_{thresh}$, at which the collagen content reaches the specified threshold, $C_{thresh} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.
