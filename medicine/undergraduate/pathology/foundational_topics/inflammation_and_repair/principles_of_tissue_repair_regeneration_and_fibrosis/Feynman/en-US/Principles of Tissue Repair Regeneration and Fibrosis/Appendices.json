This exercise allows us to quantify this difference by building simple but powerful kinetic models for wound closure . By applying fundamental principles of rates and motion, we can derive the time required for closure in both scenarios, providing a clear mathematical rationale for why healing by secondary intention is a far slower and more complex process.",

            "problem": "A biomedical engineer proposes a minimal mechanistic model to compare closure kinetics of two surgically similar skin wounds in a healthy adult under standardized conditions. The two wounds differ only in geometry and intention type. Wound A is a clean, sutured linear incision healing by primary intention; after suturing, the opposing epithelial fronts are separated by a uniform gap of width $g$. Wound B is an unsutured circular defect of initial radius $r_0$ healing by secondary intention.\n\nUse the following foundational modeling assumptions rooted in core definitions of rates and well-tested kinetic laws in tissue repair:\n1. Epithelial migration is modeled as a constant per-front crawl speed $s$ relative to the stationary dermal bed. For a linear gap with two opposing fronts, the gap width $W(t)$ obeys $dW/dt=-2s$ until closure. For a circular wound, the epithelial edge advances radially inward at speed $s$, contributing $dr/dt=-s$.\n2. Myofibroblast-mediated wound contraction in secondary intention produces an inward radial velocity proportional to the current radius, consistent with a first-order linear law for geometrically self-similar contraction. Specifically, the contraction contribution to radial velocity is $-k r(t)$, where $k$ is a constant with units of inverse time.\n3. Over the time to re-epithelial closure, $s$ and $k$ remain constant, and other processes (inflammation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and proliferation) do not alter these effective rates.\n\nLet Wound A have gap $g=0.5$ mm and Wound B have initial radius $r_0=5$ mm. Let the per-front epithelial migration speed be $s=0.05$ mm/h and the contraction coefficient be $k=0.02$ h$^{-1}$. Define $t_1$ as the time to closure for Wound A and $t_2$ as the time to closure for Wound B. Using only the assumptions above and fundamental definitions of rates and solutions to first-order linear differential equations, derive expressions for $t_1$ and $t_2$ and compute the ratio $R=t_2/t_1$.\n\nRound your final numerical answer for $R$ to four significant figures. Express your final answer as a pure number (no units).",

Healing occurs by epithelial migration from two opposing fronts, each moving at speed $s$. The rate of closure of the gap width $W(t)$ is the sum of the speeds of the two fronts:\n$$ \\frac{dW}{dt} = -2s $$\nTo find the closure time $t_1$, we integrate this equation from the initial condition $W(0) = g$ to the final condition $W(t_1) = 0$:\n$$ \\int_{g}^{0} dW = \\int_{0}^{t_1} -2s \\, dt $$\n$$ 0 - g = -2s(t_1 - 0) $$\nSolving for $t_1$:\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{g}{2s} $$\n\n**Analysis of Wound B: Secondary Intention Healing**\nWound B is a circular defect of initial radius $r_0$. The radius $r(t)$ decreases due to two processes: epithelial migration (inward speed $s$) and wound contraction (inward speed proportional to the radius, $k r(t)$). The total rate of change of the radius is:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} = -s - k r(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it into standard form:\n$$ \\frac{dr}{dt} + k r(t) = -s $$\nThe solution to this equation with the initial condition $r(0) = r_0$ is:\n$$ r(t) = \\left(r_0 + \\frac{s}{k}\\right) e^{-kt} - \\frac{s}{k} $$\nClosure occurs at time $t_2$ when $r(t_2) = 0$.
