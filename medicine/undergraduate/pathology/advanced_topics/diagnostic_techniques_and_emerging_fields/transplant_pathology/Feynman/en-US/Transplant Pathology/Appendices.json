            "problem": "A $45$-year-old patient is $21$ days post deceased-donor kidney transplantation. The baseline serum creatinine was $1.2$ mg/dL and has risen steadily to $2.3$ mg/dL over the past $72$ hours. There is no fever, urinary obstruction, or dehydration, and tacrolimus levels are within the target range. An allograft biopsy is performed. According to semiquantitative scoring and standardized reporting, the biopsy shows: interstitial inflammation $i=3$ (inflammation involving greater than $50\\%$ of non-sclerotic cortex), tubulitis $t=3$ (severe tubulitis), intimal arteritis $v=1$ (arteritis present in at least one artery without luminal occlusion), glomerulitis $g=0$ (absent), peritubular capillaritis $ptc=0$ (absent), and complement split product C4d ($C4d$) is negative by immunohistochemistry.\n\nUsing the standardized framework for kidney allograft rejection that classifies lesions based on the patterns and severity of interstitial inflammation, tubulitis, intimal arteritis, microvascular inflammation, and complement deposition, determine the most appropriate diagnostic category for rejection and the corresponding management implication regarding anti-rejection therapy in this clinical context.\n\nWhich of the following is the best interpretation and next step?\n\nA.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe diagnosis of kidney allograft rejection is made using the Banff Classification, which integrates clinical, serological, and histopathological findings. The provided biopsy scores are key to this process.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Biopsy Scores for T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR)**:\n    - The Banff classification grades TCMR based on the severity of interstitial inflammation ($i$), tubulitis ($t$), and intimal arteritis ($v$).\n    - The patient has interstitial inflammation score $i=3$ (>50% of cortex inflamed) and tubulitis score $t=3$ (severe tubulitis). Based on these two scores alone, the findings meet the criteria for at least Banff TCMR Grade IB (inflammation in >$25\\%$ of cortex and severe tubulitis).\n    - Critically, the biopsy also shows intimal arteritis $v=1$ (mild-to-moderate inflammation of the arterial intima). The presence of any intimal arteritis ($v>0$) signifies vascular rejection.\n    - According to the Banff criteria, $v=1$ defines **TCMR Grade IIA**.\n    - When criteria for multiple grades of TCMR are met, the highest (most severe) grade is assigned. Grade IIA (vascular rejection) is more severe than Grade IB (tubulointerstitial rejection). Therefore, the definitive diagnosis for the T-cell mediated component is TCMR Grade IIA.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Biopsy Scores for Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR)**:\n    - The diagnosis of active ABMR requires three criteria to be met:\n        1.  Histologic evidence of acute tissue injury. This can include microvascular inflammation ($g>0$ or $ptc>0$), intimal or transmural arteritis ($v>0$), or thrombotic microangiopathy. The patient has $v=1$, so this criterion is technically met.\n        2.  Evidence of antibody interaction with the endothelium. The primary finding is C4d deposition in peritubular capillaries ($C4d > 0$ by IHC or IF). In C4d-negative cases, this criterion can be met if there is at least moderate microvascular inflammation ($g+ptc \\ge 2$) and positive donor-specific antibodies (DSAs).\n        3.  Serologic evidence of circulating DSAs.\n    - In this case, the key findings for ABMR are negative. Microvascular inflammation is absent ($g=0$, $ptc=0$). C4d deposition is negative. While information on DSAs is not provided, the complete absence of microvascular inflammation and C4d makes a diagnosis of active ABMR highly unlikely and unsubstantiated by the biopsy. The arteritis ($v=1$) in this context is attributed to the TCMR process.\n\n3.  **Conclusion on Diagnosis**: Based on the definitive finding of $v=1$, the diagnosis is **T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), Grade IIA**. There is no evidence to support a diagnosis of ABMR or borderline changes.\n\n4.  **Management Implications**:\n    - The management of acute rejection depends on its type and grade.\n    - TCMR Grade IIA (vascular rejection) is a serious form of rejection that requires prompt and aggressive treatment.\n    - The first-line therapy for TCMR, including Grade IIA, is high-dose intravenous corticosteroids (e.g., \"pulse\" methylprednisolone).\n    - If the rejection does not respond to corticosteroids (steroid-refractory rejection), or in some cases as initial therapy for severe vascular rejection, treatment is escalated to a lymphocyte-depleting agent, such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) grade IB; initiate supportive care and close observation without anti-rejection therapy**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. While the $i=3$ and $t=3$ scores meet the criteria for Grade IB, the presence of $v=1$ elevates the diagnosis to Grade IIA, which is the more severe and overriding diagnosis.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Active rejection, especially of this severity, is an absolute indication for potent anti-rejection therapy. Supportive care alone would lead to graft loss.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**B. T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR) grade IIA; initiate high-dose corticosteroids and consider lymphocyte-depleting therapy if steroid-refractory**\n- **Diagnosis**: Correct. The finding of $v=1$ (mild-to-moderate intimal arteritis) is the defining feature of TCMR Grade IIA.\n- **Management**: Correct. The standard treatment algorithm for TCMR Grade IIA is to start with high-dose corticosteroids, with lymphocyte-depleting agents reserved for cases that are refractory to steroid therapy.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\n**C. Antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR); initiate plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and anti-CD20 therapy**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. There is no evidence of ABMR. The key markers, microvascular inflammation ($g=0, ptc=0$) and C4d deposition ($C4d$ negative), are absent.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. The proposed therapy is for ABMR, not TCMR.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**D. Borderline changes suspicious for acute T cell–mediated rejection; intensify maintenance immunosuppression only**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The finding of $i=3$, $t=3$, and $v=1$ far exceeds the Banff criteria for \"borderline changes,\" which involve milder inflammation with no arteritis. The findings are diagnostic of definite, not suspicious, rejection.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Intensifying maintenance immunosuppression is a strategy for borderline changes, not for severe, established vascular rejection.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\n**E. Mixed rejection (TCMR IIA and ABMR); initiate combined therapy for TCMR and ABMR**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. While there is clear evidence for TCMR Grade IIA, there is no evidence to support a concurrent diagnosis of ABMR.\n- **Management**: Incorrect. Since there is no ABMR component, therapy directed against antibodies and B cells is not indicated.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.",

            "introduction": "A crucial skill in pathology is distinguishing a primary disease from its mimics. This exercise presents a common and high-stakes diagnostic challenge: differentiating T-cell mediated rejection from BK polyomavirus nephropathy (BKPyVN), as both can present with inflammation and graft dysfunction. By carefully integrating histologic findings, immunohistochemistry, and molecular virology data, you will learn to identify the true pathogenic driver, a distinction that fundamentally alters patient management from increasing immunosuppression to decreasing it.

            "id": "4459903",
            "problem": "A patient is $6$ months post kidney allograft transplantation and presents with a rise in serum creatinine from $1.4$ to $2.1$ mg/dL. The patient is maintained on tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisone. A percutaneous kidney allograft biopsy shows interstitial inflammation and tubular epithelial injury. Using standardized histologic scoring, the pathologist records interstitial inflammation $i=2$, tubulitis $t=2$, intimal arteritis $v=0$. Peritubular capillaritis is minimal, and complement component $4$d (C4d) staining in peritubular capillaries is negative. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) with an antibody to Simian Virus $40$ (SV40) large T antigen shows strong nuclear staining in multiple tubular epithelial cells. Viral cytopathic changes with enlarged nuclei and basophilic inclusions are noted. Concurrent plasma polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is $1.2 \\times 10^{4}$ copies per mL.\n\nStarting from fundamental immunopathologic principles that define allograft rejection as an alloantigen-driven T cell–mediated or antibody-mediated injury, and define viral nephropathy as direct pathogen-induced cytopathic injury with accompanying inflammation, determine the most appropriate interpretation of the biopsy to avoid misdiagnosis and select the best initial management. Consider the role of Banff criteria for T cell–mediated rejection (TCMR), the significance of positive SV40 large T antigen staining, and the expected effect of altering immunosuppression versus intensifying it. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Diagnose acute T cell–mediated rejection grade IA based on $i=2$/$t=2$ and administer pulse methylprednisone ($500$ mg daily for $3$ days) with an increase in tacrolimus target trough.\n\nB.

Diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection due to microvascular inflammation and treat with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab; maintain current immunosuppression.\n\nD. Diagnose adenoviral nephritis based on tubular injury and treat with ribavirin; increase mycophenolate mofetil dose to control inflammation.\n\nE. Diagnose cytomegalovirus (CMV) nephritis on the basis of nuclear inclusions and treat with intravenous ganciclovir; add high-dose steroids to control concomitant rejection.",
            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to interpret the constellation of clinical and pathological findings to arrive at the most accurate diagnosis and, consequently, the correct initial management plan. The key is to correctly weigh the evidence for allograft rejection versus viral nephropathy.\n\n**1. Analysis of Evidence for Allograft Rejection:**\n\n*   **T Cell–Mediated Rejection (TCMR):** The Banff classification provides criteria for diagnosing TCMR. The biopsy shows interstitial inflammation $i=2$ (inflammation in $26-50\\%$ of cortical area) and tubulitis $t=2$ (foci with $5-10$ mononuclear cells per tubular cross-section). According to the Banff 2019 criteria, the combination of $i \\ge 2$ and $t \\ge 2$ meets the minimum criteria for Acute TCMR, Grade IA. However, the Banff classification states that these criteria are only valid in the absence of other causes of injury. The presence of intimal arteritis ($v$ score) would indicate a more severe grade of TCMR, but here $v=0$ indicates no arteritis, which is an important negative finding.\n*   **Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR):** The diagnosis of active AMR requires evidence of microvascular inflammation and antibody interaction with the endothelium. The biopsy findings argue strongly against AMR: peritubular capillaritis (a key sign of microvascular inflammation) is minimal, and the C4d stain (a marker for classical complement pathway activation by antibodies) is negative. While C4d-negative AMR exists, it would require other evidence not provided here (e.g., donor-specific antibodies, more significant microvascular inflammation scores). Therefore, AMR is highly unlikely.\n\n**2. Analysis of Evidence for Viral Nephropathy:**\n\n*   **Histology and IHC:** The biopsy shows two definitive features of polyomavirus nephropathy:\n    1.  **Viral cytopathic changes:** Enlarged tubular epithelial cell nuclei with large, homogeneous, basophilic (\"smudgy\") inclusions are the classic morphologic hallmark of BKPyV infection.\n    2.  **Positive SV40 IHC:** The antibody against SV40 large T antigen shows high cross-reactivity with the large T antigen of BKPyV. Strong nuclear staining in tubular cells is a specific and sensitive method to confirm a polyomavirus infection in tissue.\n*   **Quantitative Virology:** The plasma BKPyV PCR result is $1.2 \\times 10^{4}$ copies/mL. A plasma viral load exceeding $10^{4}$ copies/mL is a widely accepted threshold that strongly indicates the presence of BKPyV-associated nephropathy (BKPyVN), as opposed to mere viremia without kidney involvement.\n\n**3. Synthesis and Final Diagnosis:**\n\nThe patient presents with a classic diagnostic conundrum: features of inflammation that meet histologic criteria for TCMR Grade IA ($i=2$/$t=2$) coexisting with pathognomonic evidence of active BKPyV nephropathy (viral cytopathic effect, positive IHC, high viral load). In this scenario, the inflammation is understood to be the host's immune response directed against virally infected cells, rather than an alloimmune response against the graft itself. The viral infection is the primary pathogenic driver. Therefore, misdiagnosing this as primary TCMR and ignoring the viral etiology would be a grave error. The correct diagnosis is **BK polyomavirus nephropathy**. The inflammatory pattern is a secondary feature of the viral disease.\n\n**4. Determining the Correct Management:**\n\n*   **Principle:** BKPyV is an opportunistic pathogen that proliferates in the setting of excessive immunosuppression. Therefore, the cornerstone of management is to **reduce the net state of immunosuppression**, allowing the host's immune system to regain control over the virus.\n*   **Incorrect Management:** Intensifying immunosuppression (e.g., with pulse steroids, increased tacrolimus) is contraindicated. This would fuel viral replication, worsen the nephropathy, and likely lead to irreversible graft damage and loss.\n*   **Correct Management:** The standard approach is to first reduce the dose of or discontinue the antimetabolite agent (mycophenolate mofetil). If viremia persists, the calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus) dose may also be reduced. Concurrently, the patient's renal function and BKPyV plasma viral load must be serially monitored to gauge the response to the reduced immunosuppression. Adjunctive therapies like leflunomide, cidofovir, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are sometimes considered, but reduction of immunosuppression remains the primary and most effective intervention.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Diagnose acute T cell–mediated rejection grade IA based on $i=2$/$t=2$ and administer pulse methylprednisone ($500$ mg daily for $3$ days) with an increase in tacrolimus target trough.**\n*   **Analysis:** This option incorrectly identifies TCMR as the primary diagnosis by ignoring the overwhelming evidence for BKPyVN. The proposed treatment—intensifying immunosuppression—is the opposite of the correct management and would be highly detrimental to the patient.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Diagnose BK polyomavirus nephropathy given SV40 positivity and viral cytopathic changes; reduce immunosuppression and consider an antiviral strategy such as leflunomide or low-dose cidofovir, while monitoring BKPyV PCR.**\n*   **Analysis:** This option provides the correct diagnosis based on the definitive virologic evidence. The proposed management strategy aligns perfectly with established clinical guidelines: reduction of immunosuppression is the primary step, adjunctive antiviral agents are a consideration, and monitoring the viral load is essential for follow-up.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. Diagnose acute antibody-mediated rejection due to microvascular inflammation and treat with plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and rituximab; maintain current immunosuppression.**\n*   **Analysis:** The diagnosis of AMR is not supported by the biopsy findings (minimal capillaritis, C4d negative). The proposed aggressive and expensive treatment for AMR is inappropriate and would not address the underlying viral pathology.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Diagnose adenoviral nephritis based on tubular injury and treat with ribavirin; increase mycophenolate mofetil dose to control inflammation.**\n*   **Analysis:** The diagnosis of adenoviral nephritis is incorrect. The positive SV40 IHC and BKPyV PCR specifically identify BK polyomavirus as the etiologic agent. Furthermore, increasing the mycophenolate dose would worsen the condition.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Diagnose cytomegalovirus (CMV) nephritis on the basis of nuclear inclusions and treat with intravenous ganciclovir; add high-dose steroids to control concomitant rejection.**\n*   **Analysis:** While CMV also causes viral inclusions, the specific IHC and PCR results rule out CMV and confirm BKPyV. The proposed treatment with ganciclovir is for CMV, and the addition of high-dose steroids would be harmful.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "introduction": "Diagnosing antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) is a multi-faceted process that requires a logical and systematic approach. This problem moves beyond simple interpretation to test your ability to design a diagnostic workup for a patient with suspected ABMR. You will need to decide the appropriate sequence for ordering tests—including microvascular inflammation scoring, C4d staining, donor-specific antibody (DSA) analysis, and electron microscopy—justifying each step based on the underlying immunopathology of ABMR.

            "problem": "A patient is $9$ months after a deceased-donor kidney transplant. Serum creatinine has risen from $1.2$ mg/dL to $2.1$ mg/dL over $4$ weeks, with new proteinuria of $1.0$ g/day. Blood pressure is controlled, and there is no evidence of urinary tract infection. A for-cause kidney allograft biopsy shows capillary-based inflammation without significant interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates or intimal arteritis. Specifically, multiple glomerular capillary loops contain mononuclear cells consistent with endotheliitis, and peritubular capillaries show leukocyte margination; no fibrinoid necrosis or thrombi are identified. The pathologist’s preliminary read raises concern for antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR), but complement component $4$d (C4d) staining has not yet been performed, microvascular inflammation has not yet been scored using Banff criteria, and serology for donor-specific antibodies (DSA) has not yet been ordered. Light microscopy does not definitively show double contours of glomerular basement membranes. The laboratory can perform both immunofluorescence (IF) for C4d and single-antigen bead assays for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DSA. Electron microscopy (EM) is available.\n\nYou must decide on a scientifically justified, stepwise workup to confirm or refute active versus chronic/active ABMR in this biopsy. Base your reasoning on fundamental immunology and well-established transplant pathology principles: antigen–antibody binding to endothelium can activate the classical complement pathway, generating covalently bound C4d; microvascular inflammation reflects endothelial injury; serologic DSA identify circulating alloantibodies; and chronic ABMR is supported by ultrastructural remodeling, such as glomerular basement membrane duplication.\n\nWhich option outlines the most appropriate sequence of actions and decision criteria?\n\nA. Order DSA testing immediately and initiate empiric therapy if DSA are detected; perform C4d only if DSA are positive; microvascular inflammation scoring is optional because serology is the determinant of ABMR.\n\nB. First, quantify microvascular inflammation by assigning Banff glomerulitis ($g$) and peritubular capillaritis ($ptc$) scores and summing to an $MVI$ score; second, perform C4d IF on peritubular capillaries to assess antibody–endothelial interaction; third, obtain HLA DSA serology; finally, reserve EM to evaluate for chronicity (e.g., transplant glomerulopathy) if proteinuria and morphologic suspicion persist or if chronic/active ABMR classification is considered.\n\nC. Skip C4d because endothelial transcript assays have fully replaced it; rely solely on an endothelial gene expression panel to prove antibody interaction; perform EM routinely in all suspected ABMR cases regardless of clinical or morphologic features.\n\nD. Perform EM first to look for peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering and glomerular basement membrane duplication; if these are present, ABMR is confirmed and no DSA testing is necessary.\n\nE. Prioritize arteritis and tubulitis scoring to classify T cell–mediated rejection; treat with high-dose steroids; order C4d after therapy to see if complement activation persists, since ABMR cannot be present without arteritis.",
            "solution": "The workup of suspected antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) in kidney allograft pathology rests on integrating three domains derived from foundational immunology and validated histopathologic criteria:\n\n1. Antigen–antibody interactions at the endothelial surface can activate the classical complement pathway. When an alloantibody binds donor endothelium, complement component $1$q ($C1q$) is recruited, leading to cleavage of complement component $4$ ($C4$) into $C4b$, which covalently attaches to nearby surfaces and is further degraded to complement component $4$d (C4d). C4d remains covalently bound and is detectable by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence, serving as a footprint of recent or ongoing antibody–endothelial interaction.\n\n2. Endothelial injury due to alloantibody activity leads to microvascular inflammation (MVI), captured by Banff glomerulitis ($g$) and peritubular capillaritis ($ptc$) scores. Microvascular inflammation, reflected by leukocytes within glomerular capillary loops and peritubular capillaries, is a tissue manifestation of antibody-mediated endothelial activation and damage.\n\n3. Circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSA) against human leukocyte antigen (HLA) validate the presence of alloantibodies. Detection is typically by single-antigen bead assays that quantify mean fluorescence intensity and specificity. The presence of DSA supports the serologic criterion for ABMR.\n\nA complete evaluation must thus establish:\n- Histologic evidence of microvascular injury (e.g., $g$ and $ptc$ with a clinically meaningful $MVI$ burden).\n- Evidence of antibody interaction with endothelium (e.g., C4d positivity by immunofluorescence or validated endothelial transcript upregulation).\n- Serologic evidence of circulating DSA.\n\nElectron microscopy (EM) is justified when assessing chronic ABMR, which involves ultrastructural remodeling such as glomerular basement membrane duplication (transplant glomerulopathy) and peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering. EM is most informative when light microscopy is equivocal or when clinical features (e.g., proteinuria) suggest chronic microvascular damage.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation of the stepwise workup:\n- Start at the tissue level: quantify microvascular injury because it directly reflects endothelial pathology, independent of serology. Assign Banff $g$ and $ptc$ scores and consider the aggregate microvascular inflammation burden (commonly summarized as $MVI = g + ptc$). A higher $MVI$ supports active endothelial injury.\n- Establish antibody interaction with endothelium via C4d immunofluorescence in peritubular capillaries. C4d is a covalent footprint of classical complement activation following antigen–antibody binding; its detection relies on the biochemical property of $C4b$ attaching to endothelium and persisting as C4d.\n- Confirm circulating alloantibodies by ordering HLA DSA serology. This step connects tissue injury to a systemic source of effector molecules (antibodies).\n- Consider EM when chronicity is suspected based on clinical indicators (e.g., proteinuria) or equivocal light microscopic findings for basement membrane duplication. EM reveals ultrastructural chronic changes that cannot be resolved at the level of light microscopy alone, directly testing for chronic ABMR features.\n\nApplying these principles to the case:\n- The biopsy shows glomerular capillary endotheliitis and peritubular capillary inflammation, so measuring $g$ and $ptc$ is essential to quantify $MVI$. Given proteinuria of $1.0$ g/day and rising creatinine, chronicity is possible, but light microscopy does not definitively show double contours, making EM potentially useful after initial criteria are assessed.\n- C4d IF should be performed to determine whether complement-fixing antibody–endothelial interactions are present.\n- DSA testing is needed to establish a serologic source of alloantibody. Even if C4d is negative, non–complement-fixing antibodies can still cause ABMR; therefore, serology remains necessary.\n- EM should be reserved for scenarios where there is suspicion of chronic ABMR (e.g., proteinuria, time post-transplant, equivocal or absent light microscopic double contours), to assess for transplant glomerulopathy and peritubular capillary basement membrane changes.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: Incorrect. Prioritizing DSA and empiric therapy without quantifying microvascular injury neglects the tissue criterion central to ABMR. C4d is not contingent on DSA positivity; it independently evidences antibody interaction with endothelium. Microvascular inflammation scoring is not optional; it is requisite for classification and guides the distinction between active and chronic/active ABMR.\n\n- Option B: Correct. This sequence begins with tissue-level quantification ($g$, $ptc$, and $MVI$), then tests for antibody–endothelial interaction (C4d IF), followed by serologic confirmation (HLA DSA), and finally applies EM in the appropriate context to assess chronicity (transplant glomerulopathy) when proteinuria and morphologic suspicion warrant it. Each step is justified by foundational immunology (antigen–antibody binding and complement) and validated Banff-style pathology criteria.\n\n- Option C: Incorrect. Although endothelial transcript assays can indicate antibody interaction, they have not universally replaced C4d, and skipping C4d removes a well-established, biochemically grounded marker of classical complement activation. EM should not be performed routinely in all suspected ABMR; it is best reserved for assessing chronic changes or clarifying equivocal light microscopy.\n\n- Option D: Incorrect. EM is not the first step and cannot by itself confirm ABMR, as ultrastructural chronic changes do not establish active antibody-mediated endothelial injury or the presence of circulating alloantibody. DSA testing remains necessary to fulfill the serologic criterion, and tissue/serologic correlation is essential for ABMR classification.\n\n- Option E: Incorrect. Arteritis and tubulitis characterize T cell–mediated rejection, not ABMR. ABMR can occur without arteritis, and treating as T cell–mediated rejection while postponing C4d undermines the correct immunopathologic framework. ABMR does not require arteritis, and C4d should be performed promptly to assess antibody interaction.\n\nTherefore, Option B most accurately reflects a scientifically justified, stepwise workup and decision-making pathway for suspected ABMR, integrating microvascular inflammation quantification, C4d assessment, DSA testing, and judicious EM use for chronicity.",
