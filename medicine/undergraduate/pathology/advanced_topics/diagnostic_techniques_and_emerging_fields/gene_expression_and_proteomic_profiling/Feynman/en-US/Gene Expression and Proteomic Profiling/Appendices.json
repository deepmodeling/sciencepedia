This exercise deconstructs the instrument's fundamental measurement—the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$)—and explores how the natural isotopic composition of elements creates characteristic peak patterns. By working through this problem , you will gain crucial intuition for reading mass spectra and learn how an ion's charge state can be determined directly from the data.",

            "problem": "A pathology proteomics laboratory uses Electrospray Ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry to analyze a tryptic peptide. The peptide’s neutral monoisotopic mass is $M = 1648.845$ daltons (Da). In ESI, the peptide acquires positive charges through protonation, where the mass of a proton is $m_{H} = 1.007276$ Da. The instrument reports mass-to-charge ratio $m/z$ in Thomson (Th), where $1$ Th corresponds to $1$ Da per unit charge.\n\nStarting from the definitions of mass-to-charge ratio and protonation, and treating the observed precursor ion as a doubly protonated species, derive the expression for the theoretical $m/z$ of the ion and compute its value.

In particular, analyze conditions under which the monoisotopic peak may not be the most intense member of the isotopic cluster and how charge state influences peak spacing. Provide this analysis as part of your solution. Your final boxed answer must be only the computed numerical $m/z$.",
            "solution": "The problem presents two tasks. The first is to derive an expression for the theoretical mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) of a doubly protonated peptide and compute its value. The second is to provide a theoretical analysis of the peptide's isotopic envelope.\n\nFirst, we address the calculation of the mass-to-charge ratio.\nThe neutral monoisotopic mass of the peptide is given as $M = 1648.845$ daltons (Da).\nIn Electrospray Ionization (ESI), the peptide molecule becomes an ion by acquiring one or more protons. The mass of a single proton is given as $m_{H} = 1.007276$ Da.\nLet $z$ be the charge state of the ion, which represents the number of protons added to the neutral molecule. The mass of the resulting ion, $m_{ion}$, is the sum of the neutral mass and the mass of the added protons.\n$$m_{ion} = M + z \\cdot m_{H}$$\nThe mass-to-charge ratio, denoted as $m/z$, is defined as the mass of the ion divided by its charge state.\n$$(m/z) = \\frac{m_{ion}}{z} = \\frac{M + z \\cdot m_{H}}{z}$$\nIn this problem, the peptide is specified to be a doubly protonated species. Therefore, the charge state is $z = 2$.\nSubstituting the given values into the expression for $m/z$:\n$$M = 1648.845 \\text{ Da}$$\n$$m_{H} = 1.007276 \\text{ Da}$$\n$$z = 2$$\nThe mass of the doubly protonated ion is:\n$$m_{ion} = 1648.845 + 2 \\times 1.007276 = 1648.845 + 2.014552 = 1650.859552 \\text{ Da}$$\nThe theoretical $m/z$ is then calculated as:\n$$(m/z) = \\frac{1650.859552}{2} = 825.429776 \\text{ Th}$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to six significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $825.429776$. The first six significant figures are $8$, $2$, $5$, $4$, $2$, and $9$. The seventh digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the sixth digit. This gives $825.430$. The trailing zero is significant.\n\nSecond, we analyze the isotopic envelope. Peptides are composed of elements (primarily C, H, N, O, S) that have naturally occurring stable isotopes. The monoisotopic peak corresponds to the molecule containing only the most abundant isotope of each element (e.g., $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$, $^{1}\\mathrm{H}$, $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$, $^{16}\\mathrm{O}$). Subsequent peaks in the isotopic cluster, often labeled A+1, A+2, etc., correspond to molecules containing one, two, etc., heavy isotopes, respectively. The most significant contributor to the A+1 peak is the substitution of a single $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ atom with a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ atom, due to the high number of carbon atoms in a peptide and the natural abundance of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$, which is given as $p_{13} = 0.0109$.\n\nThe relative intensities of the isotopic peaks can be approximated using a binomial (or Poisson) distribution. For a peptide containing $N_{C}$ carbon atoms, the probability $P(k)$ of having exactly $k$ atoms of $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ is given by the binomial probability formula:\n$$P(k) = \\binom{N_{C}}{k} p_{13}^{k} (1 - p_{13})^{N_{C}-k}$$\nThe intensity of the monoisotopic peak (A0) is proportional to $P(0)$, and the intensity of the A+1 peak is proportional to $P(1)$. The monoisotopic peak is the most intense member of the cluster only if its intensity is greater than that of all other isotopic peaks, particularly the A+1 peak. We analyze the condition under which the A+1 peak becomes more intense than the A0 peak. This occurs when the ratio of their probabilities $P(1)/P(0)$ is greater than $1$.\n$$\\frac{P(1)}{P(0)} = \\frac{\\binom{N_{C}}{1} p_{13}^{1} (1 - p_{13})^{N_{C}-1}}{\\binom{N_{C}}{0} p_{13}^{0} (1 - p_{13})^{N_{C}}} = \\frac{N_{C} \\cdot p_{13} \\cdot (1 - p_{13})^{N_{C}-1}}{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot (1 - p_{13})^{N_{C}}} = \\frac{N_{C} \\cdot p_{13}}{1 - p_{13}}$$\nThe A+1 peak will be more intense than the A0 peak when this ratio exceeds $1$.\n$$N_{C} > \\frac{1 - p_{13}}{p_{13}}$$\nSubstituting the given abundance $p_{13} = 0.0109$:\n$$N_{C} > \\frac{1 - 0.0109}{0.0109} = \\frac{0.9891}{0.0109} \\approx 90.74$$\nThus, for molecules containing approximately $91$ or more carbon atoms, the A+1 isotopic peak is predicted to be more intense than the monoisotopic peak. For large biomolecules like proteins, the monoisotopic peak can be vanishingly small or non-existent in the measured spectrum.\n\nFinally, we analyze the influence of charge state on peak spacing. The isotopic peaks are separated by a mass difference, $\\Delta M$, which is primarily due to the mass difference between a $^{13}\\mathrm{C}$ and a $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ nucleus. This mass difference is $\\Delta M = M(^{13}\\mathrm{C}) - M(^{12}\\mathrm{C}) \\approx 1.00335$ Da. For simplicity, this is often approximated as $1$ Da. In the mass spectrum, we observe peaks at $m/z$ values. The spacing between adjacent isotopic peaks, $\\Delta(m/z)$, is the difference in their $m/z$ values.\nLet $(m/z)_{A0}$ be the m/z of the monoisotopic ion and $(m/z)_{A+1}$ be the m/z of the A+1 ion.\n$$(m/z)_{A0} = \\frac{M + z m_{H}}{z}$$\n$$(m/z)_{A+1} = \\frac{(M + \\Delta M) + z m_{H}}{z}$$\nThe spacing is:\n$$\\Delta(m/z) = (m/z)_{A+1} - (m/z)_{A0} = \\frac{(M + \\Delta M) + z m_{H}}{z} - \\frac{M + z m_{H}}{z} = \\frac{\\Delta M}{z}$$\nUsing the approximation $\\Delta M \\approx 1$ Da, the spacing is:\n$$\\Delta(m/z) \\approx \\frac{1}{z} \\text{ Th}$$\nThis equation shows that the spacing between isotopic peaks in an $m/z$ spectrum is inversely proportional to the charge state $z$.\nFor a singly charged ion ($z=1$), the peaks are separated by $\\approx 1$ Th.\nFor a doubly charged ion ($z=2$), as in this problem, the peaks are separated by $\\approx \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ Th.\nFor a triply charged ion ($z=3$), the peaks are separated by $\\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.33$ Th.\nThis property is fundamental in high-resolution mass spectrometry, as it allows for the unambiguous determination of an ion's charge state directly from the spacing of its resolved isotopic peaks.",

            "problem": "In a pathology study of gene expression using Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) microarrays, investigators compare log₂ expression values between tumor tissue and patient-matched adjacent normal tissue to detect a mean difference in expression. Consider two experimental designs that use the same total number of tissue samples, $N$: (i) an unpaired design with $N/2$ independent tumor samples and $N/2$ independent normal samples, and (ii) a paired design with $N/2$ matched pairs, each pair consisting of a tumor and its adjacent normal from the same patient.\n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic and widely used modeling assumptions for log₂ expression of a given gene:\n- Within each condition (tumor or normal), individual-level expression has the same variance, denoted $\\sigma^{2}$.\n- Across conditions within the same patient, the tumor and normal expression measurements have correlation $\\rho$ and covariance $\\rho \\sigma^{2}$.\n- The true mean difference in expression (tumor minus normal) is $\\delta$.\n- Large-sample normal approximations apply for test statistics based on sample means.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of variance, covariance, and correlation, derive how the paired design reduces the variance of the estimator of the mean difference compared to the unpaired design.

            "solution": "The objective is to compare the statistical properties of the estimators for the mean difference, $\\delta$, under two different experimental designs.\n\n**1. Unpaired Design Analysis**\n\nIn the unpaired design, we have two independent groups of samples: tumor samples $T_1, T_2, \\ldots, T_{N/2}$ and normal samples $N_1, N_2, \\ldots, N_{N/2}$.\nThe sample mean for the tumor group is $\\bar{T} = \\frac{2}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} T_i$, and for the normal group is $\\bar{N} = \\frac{2}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N/2} N_j$.\nThe estimator for the mean difference $\\delta$ is $\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{unpaired}} = \\bar{T} - \\bar{N}$.\n\nTo assess the precision of this estimator, we compute its variance. Since the two groups of samples are independent, their sample means $\\bar{T}$ and $\\bar{N}$ are also independent. The variance of a difference of independent random variables is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{unpaired}}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{T} - \\bar{N}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{T}) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{N})\n$$\nThe variance of a sample mean of $k$ independent, identically distributed random variables with variance $\\sigma^2$ is $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{k}$.\nFor the tumor group, with $k = N/2$ samples:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{T}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(T_i)}{N/2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N/2} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N}\n$$\nSimilarly, for the normal group, with $k = N/2$ samples:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\bar{N}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(N_j)}{N/2} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N/2} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the variance of the estimator:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{unpaired}}) = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N} + \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{N} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2}{N}\n$$\n\n**2. Paired Design Analysis**\n\nIn the paired design, we have $n_p = N/2$ pairs of samples $(T_i, N_i)$ for $i=1, 2, \\ldots, N/2$. The key difference from the unpaired design is that $T_i$ and $N_i$ are correlated. We analyze the differences within each pair, $D_i = T_i - N_i$.\nThe estimator for the mean difference $\\delta$ is the mean of these individual differences:\n$$\n\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{paired}} = \\bar{D} = \\frac{1}{N/2}\\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} D_i = \\frac{2}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} (T_i - N_i)\n$$\nThe variance of this estimator is the variance of the sample mean of the differences:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{paired}}) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{D}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(D_i)}{N/2}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must find the variance of a single difference, $\\text{Var}(D_i) = \\text{Var}(T_i - N_i)$. Using the general formula for the variance of a difference of two random variables, $\\text{Var}(X - Y) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y) - 2\\text{Cov}(X, Y)$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(D_i) = \\text{Var}(T_i) + \\text{Var}(N_i) - 2\\text{Cov}(T_i, N_i)\n$$\nWe are given $\\text{Var}(T_i) = \\sigma^2$, $\\text{Var}(N_i) = \\sigma^2$, and $\\text{Cov}(T_i, N_i) = \\rho\\sigma^2$. Substituting these values:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(D_i) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 - 2\\rho\\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2 - 2\\rho\\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2(1 - \\rho)\n$$\nNow we can find the variance of the estimator for the paired design:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{paired}}) = \\frac{\\text{Var}(D_i)}{N/2} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(1 - \\rho)}{N/2} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2(1 - \\rho)}{N}\n$$\n\n**3. Variance Reduction and Power Gain Factor**\n\nFirst, we compare the variances to show the reduction. The ratio of the variances is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{paired}})}{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{unpaired}})} = \\frac{4\\sigma^2(1 - \\rho)/N}{4\\sigma^2/N} = 1 - \\rho\n$$\nSince patient-matched tissues typically exhibit positive correlation ($\\rho > 0$), the factor $(1 - \\rho)$ is less than $1$. This demonstrates that the paired design reduces the variance of the estimator of the mean difference by a factor of $(1 - \\rho)$ compared to an unpaired design with the same total number of samples.\n\nNext, we address the power gain factor. Under large-sample assumptions, the statistical power of a test is a monotonically increasing function of the magnitude of its noncentrality parameter (NCP), typically denoted $\\lambda$. The NCP for a z-test of a mean is defined as the true mean divided by the standard error of the estimator: $\\lambda = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta})}}$.\n\nFor the unpaired design, the NCP is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{unpaired}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{unpaired}})}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2/N}} = \\frac{\\delta\\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma}\n$$\nFor the paired design, the NCP is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{paired}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{\\text{paired}})}} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\sqrt{4\\sigma^2(1-\\rho)/N}} = \\frac{\\delta\\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{1-\\rho}}\n$$\nThe power gain factor is defined as the ratio of these noncentrality parameters:\n$$\n\\text{Power Gain Factor} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{paired}}}{\\lambda_{\\text{unpaired}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\delta\\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{1-\\rho}}}{\\frac{\\delta\\sqrt{N}}{2\\sigma}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\rho}}\n$$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to compute this factor for a correlation of $\\rho = 0.60$:\n$$\n\\text{Power Gain Factor} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 - 0.60}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.40}}\n$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.40}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.6324555...} \\approx 1.5811388...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.581$.",

Therefore, $k = 11$.\n\nAccording to the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, we reject the null hypotheses for the first $k=11$ genes. This means we declare the $11$ genes with the smallest $p$-values as being differentially expressed, while controlling the False Discovery Rate at or below the target level of $5\\%$. The number of genes to declare differentially expressed is $11$.",
