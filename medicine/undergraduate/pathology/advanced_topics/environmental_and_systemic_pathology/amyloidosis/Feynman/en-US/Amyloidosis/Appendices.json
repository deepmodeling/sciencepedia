            "introduction": "In pathology, diagnosis is rarely a certainty but rather a process of weighing probabilities based on available evidence. We often ask, \"Given this set of symptoms or biopsy findings, what is the probability of a specific disease?\" This question is answered using conditional probability, a cornerstone of diagnostic reasoning. This practice problem  will sharpen your skills in calculating these probabilities, a crucial ability for interpreting complex clinical scenarios in amyloidosis.",

            "introduction": "The formation of amyloid fibrils is a complex process that initiates with random, stochastic events at the molecular level. To understand how these microscopic uncertainties can lead to macroscopic disease, pathologists can use simplified probabilistic models. This exercise  explores the concept of an expected minimum, providing a conceptual model for \"weakest link\" failures, such as when the least stable of several protein domains initiates a misfolding cascade.",

We can model this concept by thinking of the amyloid load as a variable that is bounded by physiological rates of protein synthesis and clearance.
