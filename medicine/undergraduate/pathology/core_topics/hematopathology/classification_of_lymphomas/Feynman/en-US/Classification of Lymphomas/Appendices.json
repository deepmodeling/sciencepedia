Excisional biopsy shows complete effacement of nodal architecture by a diffuse proliferation of medium to large atypical lymphoid cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates positivity for cluster of differentiation $20$ (CD20), negativity for cluster of differentiation $3$ (CD3), negativity for cluster of differentiation $10$ (CD10), positivity for B-cell lymphoma $6$ (BCL6), positivity for multiple myeloma oncogene $1$ (MUM1; Interferon Regulatory Factor $4$), and negativity for cyclin D$1$.

            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement is established as follows.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient Age: $62$ years\n- Clinical Presentation: Rapidly enlarging cervical lymph node\n- Histology: Complete effacement of nodal architecture by a diffuse proliferation of medium to large atypical lymphoid cells with vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.\n- Immunohistochemistry (IHC):\n    - Cluster of Differentiation $20$ (CD20): Positive\n    - Cluster of Differentiation $3$ (CD3): Negative\n    - Cluster of Differentiation $10$ (CD10): Negative\n    - B-cell lymphoma $6$ (BCL6): Positive\n    - Multiple Myeloma Oncogene $1$ (MUM1)/Interferon Regulatory Factor $4$ (IRF4): Positive\n    - Cyclin D$1$: Negative\n- Additional Information: No mediastinal mass mentioned; Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) not performed.\n- Required Framework: World Health Organization (WHO) classification; cell-of-origin framework.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, presenting a standard clinical scenario in hematopathology. The provided histological and immunophenotypic data is coherent and represents a plausible case. The terminology and diagnostic principles cited (WHO classification, cell-of-origin) are central to modern lymphoma pathology. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine the most likely diagnosis and evaluate the differential diagnoses provided in the options. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors in the problem statement.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Diagnosis**\n\nThe presented case is a lymphoma characterized by a diffuse proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells. The first step is to determine the cell lineage.\n\n$1$. **Lineage Determination**: The tumor cells are positive for CD$20$, a B-cell marker, and negative for CD$3$, a T-cell marker. This combination establishes the diagnosis of a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL).\n\n$2$. **Subclassification of Large B-cell Lymphoma**: The morphology (diffuse proliferation of large cells) in an older adult strongly suggests an aggressive B-cell lymphoma, with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) being the most common type. Other major differentials for a large B-cell lymphoma include Burkitt lymphoma (BL), high-grade follicular lymphoma (FL G$3$B), and the blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The IHC panel is used to differentiate these entities and to subclassify DLBCL based on the cell-of-origin (COO).\n\n$3$. **Cell-of-Origin (COO) Classification for DLBCL**: The Hans algorithm is a commonly used IHC-based surrogate for COO classification, dividing DLBCL into germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) and activated B-cell-like (ABC) or non-GCB types. The algorithm uses CD$10$, BCL$6$, and MUM$1$.\n    - GCB phenotype: CD$10$+ or (CD$10$- and BCL$6$+ and MUM$1$-)\n    - Non-GCB/ABC phenotype: CD$10$- and BCL$6$- or (CD$10$- and BCL$6$+ and MUM$1$+)\n\nApplying the patient's IHC results to the Hans algorithm:\n- CD$10$: Negative\n- BCL$6$: Positive\n- MUM$1$: Positive\n\nThe pattern (CD$10$-, BCL$6$+, MUM$1$+) corresponds to the **non-GCB/ABC phenotype** of DLBCL. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is DLBCL, not otherwise specified (NOS), of the ABC subtype.\n\n$4$. **Evaluation of Differential Diagnoses**:\n- **Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)**: The vast majority of MCL cases, including the aggressive blastoid variant, are characterized by the t($11$;$14$) translocation, leading to overexpression of Cyclin D$1$. The provided result of **Cyclin D1 negativity** is a strong and virtually definitive feature against the diagnosis of MCL.\n- **Burkitt Lymphoma (BL)**: Classic BL is characterized by a specific immunophenotype: CD$10$+, BCL$6$+, BCL$2$-, and a Ki-$67$ proliferation index near $100\\%$. Critically, classic BL is **MUM1 negative**. The patient's phenotype of **CD10 negativity** and **MUM1 positivity** effectively excludes classic BL.\n- **Follicular Lymphoma (FL)**: FL is typically a germinal center-derived lymphoma, characterized by positivity for CD$10$ and BCL$6$. While high-grade FL (Grade $3$B) consists of diffuse sheets of large B-cells, the expected phenotype is CD$10$+. The **CD10 negativity** in this case makes FL an unlikely diagnosis. The overall profile points more strongly to an ABC-type DLBCL.\n- **Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma (PTCL)**: This is a malignancy of T-cells. The tumor cells must express T-cell lineage markers, such as CD$3$. This case is definitively **CD3 negative** and **CD20 positive**, thus it is a B-cell lymphoma, and PTCL is ruled out.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The combination of clinical, morphological, and immunophenotypic features points unequivocally to a diagnosis of Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma, Not Otherwise Specified (DLBCL, NOS), of the Activated B-cell (ABC) or non-GCB subtype.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL, NOS), activated B-cell (ABC) phenotype; ruled in by CD20 positivity, CD3 negativity, diffuse architecture, and CD10 negativity with BCL6 positivity and MUM1 positivity; ruled out alternatives by cyclin D$1$ negativity (excluding mantle cell lymphoma), lack of follicular architecture and CD10 negativity (excluding follicular lymphoma), and MUM1 positivity with CD10 negativity (excluding Burkitt lymphoma).**\n- This option correctly identifies the diagnosis as DLBCL, ABC-type.\n- The reasoning for inclusion is sound: it correctly identifies the lineage (CD$20$+, CD$3$-), morphology (diffuse, large cells), and the specific IHC pattern (CD$10$-, BCL$6$+, MUM$1$+) that defines the ABC subtype via the Hans algorithm.\n- The reasoning for exclusion of alternatives is also correct and precise: Cyclin D$1$ negativity rules out MCL; CD$10$ negativity makes FL unlikely; and the combination of CD$10$ negativity and MUM$1$ positivity rules out classic BL.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Follicular lymphoma grade $3$B; supported by BCL6 positivity and diffuse sheets of large cells; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity; the absence of cyclin D$1$ is non-contributory.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect. While FL grade $3$B can have diffuse architecture and expresses BCL$6$, it is typically CD$10$ positive. The presented phenotype is more consistent with DLBCL, ABC-type.\n- The reasoning is flawed. Stating that alternatives are \"ruled out by CD$20$ positivity\" is nonsensical, as CD$20$ is positive in almost all B-cell lymphomas, which are the main alternatives.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Burkitt lymphoma; supported by large cell size and BCL6 positivity; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity and CD3 negativity; CD10 negativity and MUM1 positivity are not decisive.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The statement that \"CD$10$ negativity and MUM$1$ positivity are not decisive\" is factually wrong. These two markers are critical for the differential diagnosis with BL and are strong evidence against it. Furthermore, ruling out other B-cell lymphomas via CD$20$ positivity is illogical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Mantle cell lymphoma, blastoid variant; supported by diffuse architecture and large cells; ruled out alternatives by CD20 positivity; cyclin D$1$ negativity does not exclude this subtype.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. The claim that \"cyclin D$1$ negativity does not exclude this subtype\" is misleading in this context. While exceedingly rare exceptions exist, for all standard diagnostic purposes, cyclin D$1$ negativity is considered a definitive feature to rule out MCL. The rule-out criteria (\"by CD$20$ positivity\") are also nonsensical.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS); supported by diffuse architecture and large cells; ruled out alternatives by negativity for CD10 and cyclin D$1$; CD3 negativity is not definitive.**\n- The diagnosis is incorrect. This is a B-cell lymphoma.\n- The reasoning is fundamentally flawed. The statement that \"CD$3$ negativity is not definitive\" is incorrect. The absence of the pan-T-cell marker CD$3$ on the neoplastic cells absolutely excludes a T-cell lymphoma. The reasoning for ruling out alternatives is also irrelevant.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Ki-$67$ labeling index of approximately $95\\%$.\n*   **Genetics (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization - FISH):** Rearrangement of MYC detected; rearrangement of BCL2 detected; no rearrangement of BCL6 detected.\n*   **Instruction:** Select the most precise classification for this neoplasm within the high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBL) categories, based on modern classification principles integrating immunophenotype and genetics.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of modern hematopathology. It uses standard diagnostic modalities (histology, IHC, FISH) and terminology (CD markers, gene names like MYC, BCL2, BCL6) that are central to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours. The described constellation of findings represents a recognized clinical entity.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The provided data is comprehensive and sufficient to arrive at a specific diagnosis according to established international classification schemes. The question asks for the \"most precise classification,\" which directs the solver to use the hierarchical logic of the WHO classification to find the single best-fit diagnosis.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem presents a set of objective laboratory and pathological findings without subjective interpretation or bias.\n4.  **Flaw Analysis:**\n    *   The problem does not violate any scientific principles. The combination of a GCB-phenotype (CD10+, BCL6+), high proliferation (Ki-67 $\\approx 95\\%$), and concurrent MYC and BCL2 rearrangements is a well-documented, albeit aggressive, form of lymphoma.\n    *   The problem is not incomplete or contradictory. The high Ki-$67$ index is consistent with the numerous mitoses and the high-grade nature of the lymphoma. The IHC profile points to a germinal center B-cell origin, and the genetic findings are the definitive feature for subclassification.\n    *   The scenario is clinically realistic.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It presents a classic diagnostic challenge in hematopathology that can be resolved by applying the established rules of the current WHO classification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe diagnosis of lymphomas is a multi-step process that integrates morphology, immunophenotype, and genetic findings, as stipulated by the WHO classification.\n\n1.  **Initial Assessment (Morphology and Lineage):** The biopsy shows a diffuse proliferation of large lymphoid cells, confirming a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma-like morphology. The expression of CD20 confirms the B-cell lineage. The high mitotic rate, high Ki-$67$ index of approximately $95\\%$, and presence of tangible-body macrophages (giving a \"starry-sky\" appearance) all point towards a very aggressive, high-grade lymphoma.\n\n2.  **Cell-of-Origin (COO) Assessment (Immunophenotype):** The lymphoma cells express both CD10 and BCL6. This immunoprofile is characteristic of a germinal center B-cell (GCB) origin. The expression of BCL2 protein is also noted.\n\n3.  **Genetic Assessment (FISH):** This is the most critical step for precise classification in this case. The FISH analysis reveals rearrangements of both the *MYC* gene and the *BCL2* gene. There is no *BCL6* rearrangement.\n\n4.  **Integration and Final Classification (Applying WHO Criteria):** The WHO classification for haematolymphoid tumors has a specific category for B-cell lymphomas that possess rearrangements of *MYC* in combination with rearrangements of *BCL2* and/or *BCL6*. These are colloquially known as \"double-hit\" or \"triple-hit\" lymphomas.\n    *   The definitive diagnostic criterion for \"High-grade B-cell lymphoma with *MYC* and *BCL2* rearrangements\" is the presence of a high-grade B-cell lymphoma (typically with morphology of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma) that demonstrates, by FISH or other cytogenetic methods, rearrangements of the *MYC* gene and the *BCL2* gene.\n    *   The case presented fulfills these criteria precisely: it is a high-grade B-cell neoplasm with documented rearrangements of *MYC* and *BCL2*.\n\nThis specific genetic finding defines the entity and takes precedence over less specific classifications like \"DLBCL, NOS.\"\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, germinal center B-cell–type (DLBCL, NOS, GCB subtype):** This diagnosis is incorrect. While the lymphoma has the morphology and GCB-immunophenotype of a DLBCL, the term \"Not Otherwise Specified\" (NOS) is reserved for cases that do not meet the criteria for specific, genetically-defined entities. Since this lymphoma has concurrent *MYC* and *BCL2* rearrangements, it must be classified into the more specific HGBL category. The presence of the \"double hit\" genetics precludes a diagnosis of DLBCL, NOS. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Burkitt lymphoma:** This diagnosis is incorrect. While the high Ki-$67$ index ($>95\\%$) and \"starry sky\" morphology are characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), a defining feature of classic BL is an isolated *MYC* rearrangement without a concurrent *BCL2* or *BCL6* rearrangement. The presence of a *BCL2* rearrangement in this case explicitly excludes the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. High-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements:** This diagnosis is correct. It is the specific entity defined by the WHO classification for high-grade B-cell lymphomas that harbor rearrangements of both the *MYC* and *BCL2* genes. All the features described in the problem—the morphology, immunophenotype, and, most importantly, the specific genetic profile—are the defining characteristics of this diagnosis. This is the most precise classification possible. **Correct.**\n\n*   **D. High-grade B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (HGBL, NOS):** This diagnosis is incorrect. The HGBL, NOS category is a diagnosis of exclusion for cases that have morphological features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (\"blastoid\" or \"Burkitt-like\" features) but *lack* the *MYC* and *BCL2*/*BCL6* rearrangements that define double/triple-hit lymphomas. Since this case *has* the definitive rearrangements, it does not belong in the NOS category. **Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Follicular lymphoma grade 3B with transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma:** This diagnosis is incorrect. A key piece of evidence for this diagnosis would be the presence of a follicular growth pattern, at least focally, representing the underlying follicular lymphoma. The problem statement explicitly notes that \"There is no follicular architectural pattern identified in the biopsy,\" which rules out this diagnosis. **Incorrect.**",

Peripheral blood smears show small to intermediate, mature-appearing lymphocytes without cytoplasmic villi. Bone marrow biopsy demonstrates interstitial and nodular lymphoid aggregates. Flow cytometry on peripheral blood shows a clonal B-cell population with the following immunophenotype: CD$19$+, CD$20$ bright, CD$5$+, CD$23$−, surface immunoglobulin (sIg) strong, CD$79$b bright, FMC$7$+, CD$10$−, CD$43$ variable, CD$200$ low, CD$103$−, CD$11$c+.

The data is sufficient and clear, allowing for a rigorous differential diagnosis.\n\nThe problem requires a stepwise exclusion based on the provided data to arrive at the most appropriate integrated diagnosis for a CD$5$-positive small B-cell neoplasm. The primary differential diagnoses for a CD$5$+ clonal B-cell population include Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). However, as stated in the problem's preamble, other lymphomas can aberrantly express CD$5$.\n\nLet us analyze the patient's data against the differential diagnoses. The patient is a $65$-year-old male with splenomegaly and lymphocytosis. The clonal B-cells have the following key features:\n- **Immunophenotype**: CD$19$+, CD$20$ bright, CD$5$+, CD$23$−, strong surface immunoglobulin (sIg), CD$79$b bright, FMC$7$+, CD$10$−, CD$43$ variable, CD$200$ low, CD$103$−, CD$11$c+.\n- **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**: Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor $1$ (LEF$1$) negative, cyclin D$1$ negative, SRY-related HMG-box gene $11$ (SOX$11$) negative.\n- **Genetics**: No $t(11;14)$, no del(13q), no trisomy 12. Presence of del(7q).\n- **Molecular**: Negative for MYD88 p.L265P mutation.\n- **Serology**: No IgM paraprotein.\n\n**1. Evaluation against Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL):**\nA typical immunophenotype for CLL/SLL includes the expression of CD$5$ and CD$23$, with dim expression of CD$20$, dim sIg, and negativity for FMC$7$. Furthermore, CLL/SLL is typically characterized by high expression of CD$200$ and nuclear staining for LEF$1$. The patient's phenotype is strikingly discordant with CLL/SLL:\n- CD$23$ is negative (classic CLL/SLL is CD$23$+).\n- CD$20$ is bright and sIg is strong (classic CLL/SLL is dim).\n- FMC$7$ is positive (classic CLL/SLL is negative).\n- CD$200$ is low (classic CLL/SLL shows high expression).\n- LEF$1$ IHC is negative (classic CLL/SLL is positive).\n- Common cytogenetic abnormalities like del(13q) and trisomy 12 are absent.\nThe combination of these findings, particularly the negative CD$23$, bright CD$20$, strong sIg, positive FMC$7$, low CD$200$, and negative LEF$1$, makes a diagnosis of CLL/SLL, even an atypical variant, untenable.\n\n**2. Evaluation against Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL):**\nThe typical immunophenotype of MCL (CD$5$+, CD$23$−, bright CD$20$, strong sIg, FMC$7$+) matches the patient's profile well. However, MCL is defined by the overexpression of cyclin D$1$, most commonly due to the $t(11;14)$ translocation.\n- The patient is negative for the $t(11;14)$ translocation by FISH.\n- IHC for cyclin D$1$ is negative.\nThis rules out classic, cyclin D$1$-positive MCL. A small subset of MCL cases are cyclin D$1$-negative and lack $t(11;14)$. These cases are often positive for SOX$11$ by IHC and/or harbor rearrangements of the cyclin D$2$ (*CCND2*) or D$3$ (*CCND3*) genes.\n- The patient's lymphoma is SOX$11$ negative.\nWithout positivity for cyclin D$1$ or SOX$11$, and in the absence of $t(11;14)$, a diagnosis of MCL is extremely unlikely.\n\n**3. Evaluation against Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL):**\nLPL can occasionally be CD$5$ positive. However, it is defined by plasmacytoid differentiation and, in over $90$% of cases, the presence of the MYD$88$ p.L265P mutation. When associated with an IgM paraprotein, it is termed Waldenström Macroglobulinemia.\n- The patient's lymphoma is negative for the MYD88 p.L265P mutation.\n- Serum protein electrophoresis does not show an IgM paraprotein.\n- The reported morphology does not mention plasmacytoid features.\nThese findings effectively exclude a diagnosis of LPL.\n\n**4. Evaluation against Splenic B-cell lymphomas (Hairy Cell Leukemia and variants):**\n- Classic Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is characterized by a specific immunophenotype (CD$11$c+, CD$25$+, CD$103$+, Annexin A$1$+) and is nearly always driven by the BRAF V$600$E mutation. The patient's cells are CD$103$−, which argues strongly against HCL.\n- Hairy Cell Leukemia variant (HCL-v) or the related entity Splenic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia with prominent nucleoli should be considered. These are typically CD$11$c+, CD$103$+, but CD$25$− and Annexin A$1$−. The patient's lymphoma cells are CD$103$−, which is a strong feature against this diagnosis as well.\n\n**5. Evaluation against Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL):**\nSMZL typically presents with progressive splenomegaly in older adults. The immunophenotype is that of a mature B-cell (CD$19$+, bright CD$20$, strong sIg), and it is characteristically negative for CD$5$, CD$10$, CD$23$, and CD$103$. FMC$7$ is often positive, and CD$11$c can be positive. Aberrant CD$5$ expression, while not typical, is well-documented in a subset of SMZL cases. The most crucial findings are genetic: SMZL lacks specific translocations like $t(11;14)$ but frequently shows deletions of chromosome $7$q (del$7$q), which is seen in approximately $40$% of cases.\n- **Clinical Presentation**: Progressive splenomegaly. (Consistent)\n- **Immunophenotype**: Bright CD$20$, strong sIg, FMC$7$+, CD$23$−, CD$103$−, CD$11$c+. (Consistent)\n- **Aberrant Marker**: CD$5$+. (Acceptable as an aberrant finding)\n- **Key Negative Markers**: LEF$1$−, cyclin D$1$−, SOX$11$−. (Effectively rules out CLL and MCL)\n- **Cytogenetics**: Absence of $t(11;14)$, del(13q), trisomy 12 is consistent. The presence of del(7q) is a strong, positive piece of evidence for SMZL.\nThe complete clinical, morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic picture is highly consistent with a diagnosis of SMZL with aberrant CD$5$ expression.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A. Atypical Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (CLL/SLL) characterized by CD$5$+, LEF$1$ positivity, high CD$200$, dim sIg, FMC$7$−, and typical del(13q) or trisomy 12**: **Incorrect**. This option describes features of typical CLL/SLL, which are the opposite of the patient's findings. The patient is LEF$1$ negative, has low CD$200$, strong sIg, is FMC$7$ positive, and lacks del(13q) or trisomy 12.\n\n- **B. Cyclin D$1$-negative Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) characterized by CD$5$+, CD$23$−, SOX$11$ positivity, and alternative CCND$2$ rearrangements despite absent $t(11;14)$**: **Incorrect**. This option states the tumor would be SOX$11$ positive. The patient's IHC results explicitly show SOX$11$ negativity, which makes this diagnosis highly improbable.\n\n- **C. Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL) with aberrant CD$5$ expression, supported by splenomegaly, CD$11$c positivity, strong sIg, FMC$7$+, LEF$1$ negativity, SOX$11$ negativity, absence of $t(11;14)$, and del(7q)**: **Correct**. This option accurately integrates all the provided data. It correctly identifies the diagnosis based on the combination of clinical presentation (splenomegaly), immunophenotype (strong sIg, FMC$7$+, CD$11$c+), exclusion of other entities (LEF$1$−, SOX$11$−, no $t(11;14)$), and the presence of a characteristic genetic marker (del(7q)). It properly contextualizes the CD$5$ positivity as an aberrant finding.\n\n- **D. Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma (LPL)/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia characterized by plasmacytoid differentiation, MYD88 p.L265P mutation, and IgM paraproteinemia**: **Incorrect**. The patient's workup was explicitly negative for the MYD88 p.L265P mutation and for an IgM paraprotein, which are defining features of the vast majority of LPL/WM cases.\n\n- **E. Hairy Cell Leukemia variant (HCL-v) or splenic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia with prominent nucleoli, characterized by CD$103$+, CD$11$c+, CD$25$−, Annexin A$1$ negative, and frequent splenomegaly**: **Incorrect**. HCL-v is typically CD$103$ positive. The patient's lymphoma is explicitly CD$103$ negative, ruling out this diagnosis.",
