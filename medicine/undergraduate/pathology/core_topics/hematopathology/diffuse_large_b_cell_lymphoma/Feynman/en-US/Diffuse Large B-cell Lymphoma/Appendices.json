            "problem": "A patient presents with a rapidly enlarging cervical lymph node clinically and radiologically suspicious for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL). An ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy yields $3$ intact cores, each approximately $1.5$ cm in length. The laboratory has capacity for three downstream modalities: flow cytometry, histomorphology with immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue, and targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for somatic mutations. You are asked to design a tissue triage workflow that maximizes diagnostic yield across all modalities.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions as your starting base:\n\n- Flow cytometry requires intact, viable cells suspended in a physiologic medium. Viability decreases with time and temperature above $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$; transport in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ is standard practice. Formalin kills cells by cross-linking proteins and nucleic acids, rendering tissue unsuitable for flow cytometry.\n- Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) blocks are made by fixing tissue in $10\\%$ neutral buffered formalin (NBF), followed by processing and paraffin embedding. This preserves morphology and antigenicity for immunohistochemistry, and DNA targets for FISH probes are robustly assessable on FFPE sections. Overfixation and underfixation can compromise antigenicity; small cores typically require on the order of $6$ to $24$ hours in $10\\%$ NBF.\n- Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) requires high-quality nucleic acids. Formalin fixation causes cross-linking and sequence artifacts; therefore, fresh tissue is optimally preserved by immediate snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen or placement into a validated nucleic acid preservative, then cold storage (e.g., at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). Cross-contamination with formalin fumes should be avoided before freezing or preservative placement.\n- FISH for DLBCL commonly targets rearrangements in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6. These assays are routinely performed on FFPE sections.\n\nHospital logistics: the flow cytometry laboratory accepts fresh tissue within $6$ hours of biopsy and recommends continuous cold chain at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$; the histology lab can process FFPE specimens fixed in $10\\%$ NBF for between $6$ and $24$ hours; the molecular lab can bank snap-frozen tissue at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ within $30$ minutes of collection or accept tissue placed immediately into an approved nucleic acid preservative.\n\nWhich of the following triage workflows best satisfies the modality-specific requirements and constraints, given the limited tissue?\n\nA. Immediately allocate one core into RPMI on ice at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and courier it to flow cytometry within $1$ hour (processing by $<6$ hours). Place a second core into $10\\%$ NBF for approximately $8$ hours, then process to FFPE for immunohistochemistry and FISH. Snap-freeze the third core in liquid nitrogen within $15$ minutes of biopsy and store at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ for NGS, ensuring it is never exposed to formalin fumes.\n\nB. Pool two cores and mince them; keep the minced tissue in normal saline at room temperature for $2$ hours before transport to flow cytometry. Fix the remaining core in $10\\%$ NBF for approximately $24$ hours for FFPE. For NGS, place half of the pooled tissue into $10\\%$ NBF for $6$ hours and then transfer to a $-20^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ freezer until sequencing.\n\nC. Place all three cores into $10\\%$ NBF for $6$ hours to standardize fixation. After fixation, allocate one to FFPE for immunohistochemistry and FISH, one to flow cytometry, and one to NGS by freezing the fixed tissue at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nD. Keep one core dry on gauze at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ for $12$ hours, then place into RPMI for flow cytometry. Fix the second core in an alcohol-based fixative (e.g., $70\\%$ ethanol) for immunohistochemistry and FISH.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Clinical Scenario**: Patient with a rapidly enlarging cervical lymph node, clinically suspicious for Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).\n- **Sample**: $3$ intact core needle biopsy cores, each approximately $1.5$ cm in length.\n- **Available Modalities**:\n    1. Flow cytometry\n    2. Histomorphology with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue\n    3. Targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for somatic mutations\n- **Goal**: Design a tissue triage workflow that maximizes diagnostic yield across all modalities.\n\n- **Foundational Fact 1 (Flow Cytometry)**: Requires intact, viable cells in a physiologic medium. Viability decreases with time and temperature above $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Standard practice is transport in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. Formalin kills cells by cross-linking and renders tissue unsuitable for flow cytometry.\n- **Foundational Fact 2 (FFPE)**: FFPE blocks are made by fixing tissue in $10\\%$ neutral buffered formalin (NBF), followed by processing and paraffin embedding. This preserves morphology and antigenicity for IHC. DNA targets for FISH are robustly assessable on FFPE sections. Fixation time for small cores is on the order of $6$ to $24$ hours.\n- **Foundational Fact 3 (NGS)**: NGS requires high-quality nucleic acids. Formalin fixation causes cross-linking and artifacts. Optimal preservation is immediate snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen or placement into a validated nucleic acid preservative, followed by cold storage (e.g., at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$). Cross-contamination with formalin fumes should be avoided.\n- **Foundational Fact 4 (FISH for DLBCL)**: Commonly targets rearrangements in MYC, BCL2, and BCL6. These assays are routinely performed on FFPE sections.\n- **Hospital Logistics 1 (Flow Cytometry)**: Accepts fresh tissue within $6$ hours of biopsy; recommends continuous cold chain at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Hospital Logistics 2 (Histology)**: Can process FFPE specimens fixed in $10\\%$ NBF for between $6$ and $24$ hours.\n- **Hospital Logistics 3 (Molecular)**: Can bank snap-frozen tissue at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ within $30$ minutes of collection or accept tissue placed immediately into an approved nucleic acid preservative.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem statement will be assessed against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of modern pathology and molecular diagnostics. The pre-analytical requirements described for flow cytometry, FFPE-based assays (histology, IHC, FISH), and NGS are accurate and reflect standard laboratory practices. The effects of fixatives (formalin) on cells and nucleic acids are correctly stated. The target genes for DLBCL FISH analysis (MYC, BCL2, BCL6) are standard.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a finite number of tissue samples ($3$ cores) and a finite number of analytical modalities ($3$), each with a clear and distinct set of pre-analytical requirements. The goal is to find the best workflow among a given set of options by logically applying the specified constraints. This structure allows for a unique, optimal solution to be identified from the choices.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and technical language. There are no subjective statements or opinions. The constraints are quantitative (e.g., time, temperature) or based on established scientific facts (e.g., effect of formalin).\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained and consistent. It provides all necessary information to evaluate the options: the number of cores, the requirements for each test, and the logistical constraints. There are no contradictions between the \"foundational facts\" and the \"hospital logistics\".\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The scenario is highly realistic. Tissue triage for small biopsies like core needles is a common and critical challenge in pathology, especially in lymphoma workups where multiple ancillary studies are required. The provided timeframes and temperatures are standard in clinical laboratories.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or ill-posed. It requires a logical application of multiple constraints to arrive at the correct answer, which is a common form of reasoning in STEM fields.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information to determine a solution. It is a valid problem. The solution process may proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe goal is to find a triage workflow that correctly allocates one core for each of the three required modalities, satisfying all pre-analytical requirements. We will first synthesize the requirements for each modality and then evaluate each option against these criteria.\n\n**Summary of Pre-analytical Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Flow Cytometry**:\n    - Specimen: Fresh, non-fixed tissue.\n    - Medium: Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium.\n    - Temperature: $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (on ice).\n    - Time: To lab within $6$ hours of biopsy.\n    - Prohibitions: No formalin exposure.\n\n2.  **Histomorphology/IHC/FISH**:\n    - Specimen: Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue.\n    - Fixative: $10\\%$ neutral buffered formalin (NBF).\n    - Fixation Time: $6$ to $24$ hours.\n    - Note: FISH for MYC, BCL2, BCL6 is performed on these FFPE sections.\n\n3.  **Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)**:\n    - Specimen: Fresh tissue.\n    - Preservation: Immediate snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ (within $30$ minutes of collection) OR immediate placement in a nucleic acid preservative with subsequent cold storage.\n    - Prohibitions: No formalin exposure (fixation or fumes).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n**A. Immediately allocate one core into RPMI on ice at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and courier it to flow cytometry within $1$ hour (processing by $<6$ hours). Place a second core into $10\\%$ NBF for approximately $8$ hours, then process to FFPE for immunohistochemistry and FISH. Snap-freeze the third core in liquid nitrogen within $15$ minutes of biopsy and store at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ for NGS, ensuring it is never exposed to formalin fumes.**\n\n- **Flow Cytometry Handling**: The core is placed immediately in RPMI at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ and transported within $1$ hour. This perfectly satisfies all requirements for viability, medium, temperature, and timeliness.\n- **Histo/IHC/FISH Handling**: The core is placed in $10\\%$ NBF for $8$ hours. This is the correct fixative, and the fixation duration is within the required $6$ to $24$ hour window. This will yield a valid FFPE block for all specified downstream tests.\n- **NGS Handling**: The core is snap-frozen within $15$ minutes, which is well within the required $30$ minute window, and stored at the correct $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$. The crucial instruction to avoid formalin fumes is included. This provides optimal material for NGS.\n\nThis workflow correctly and optimally allocates one core to each modality, satisfying all specified constraints.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Pool two cores and mince them; keep the minced tissue in normal saline at room temperature for $2$ hours before transport to flow cytometry. Fix the remaining core in $10\\%$ NBF for approximately $24$ hours for FFPE. For NGS, place half of the pooled tissue into $10\\%$ NBF for $6$ hours and then transfer to a $-20^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ freezer until sequencing.**\n\n- **Flow Cytometry Handling**: This procedure has multiple critical flaws. (1) Normal saline is used instead of the specified RPMI medium. (2) Tissue is kept at \"room temperature\" instead of the required $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, which compromises cell viability. (3) Pooling two cores is wasteful, leaving only one core for the other two modalities.\n- **Histo/IHC/FISH Handling**: Fixing the remaining core in $10\\%$ NBF for $24$ hours is acceptable, as it is within the $6-24$ hour window.\n- **NGS Handling**: This procedure is fundamentally incorrect. The tissue is fixed in $10\\%$ NBF. As stated in the problem, formalin fixation degrades nucleic acids and is unsuitable for high-quality NGS. Furthermore, storage is at $-20^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$, not the required $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.\n\nThis workflow critically fails to provide appropriate material for both flow cytometry and NGS.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Place all three cores into $10\\%$ NBF for $6$ hours to standardize fixation. After fixation, allocate one to FFPE for immunohistochemistry and FISH, one to flow cytometry, and one to NGS by freezing the fixed tissue at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.**\n\n- **Initial Step**: The initial step of placing all cores in formalin is a fatal error.\n- **Flow Cytometry Handling**: Formalin kills cells by cross-linking proteins. Formalin-fixed tissue is non-viable and entirely unsuitable for flow cytometry, as explicitly stated in the problem.\n- **NGS Handling**: Formalin fixation causes cross-linking and sequencing artifacts, rendering the tissue suboptimal for NGS. This is also explicitly stated in the problem.\n- **Histo/IHC/FISH Handling**: This part is correct; $6$ hours of formalin fixation is appropriate for generating an FFPE block.\n\nThis workflow makes it impossible to perform flow cytometry and severely compromises the quality of NGS. It fails to meet the requirements for two of the three modalities.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Keep one core dry on gauze at $4^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$ for $12$ hours, then place into RPMI for flow cytometry. Fix the second core in an alcohol-based fixative (e.g., $70\\%$ ethanol) for immunohistochemistry and FISH. Place the third core into a nucleic acid preservative and leave it at room temperature for $24$ hours before freezing at $-80^\\circ \\mathrm{C}$.**\n\n- **Flow Cytometry Handling**: This procedure has multiple flaws. (1) Keeping the core \"dry on gauze\" for $12$ hours will lead to significant desiccation and cell death, compromising viability. Viable cells are required. (2) The $12$-hour delay exceeds the $6$-hour transport window specified by the hospital logistics.\n- **Histo/IHC/FISH Handling**: The use of an alcohol-based fixative deviates from the specified protocol, which defines FFPE as being prepared from tissue fixed in $10\\%$ NBF. Alcohol fixation can alter morphology and antigenicity, potentially compromising IHC.\n- **NGS Handling**: While using a nucleic acid preservative is a valid approach, leaving the sample a-t room temperature for $24$ hours before freezing is highly questionable. The problem states preservation should be \"immediate\" followed by cold storage. A prolonged period at room temperature risks nucleic acid degradation.\n\nThis workflow uses suboptimal or incorrect procedures for all three modalities, compromising the quality of the diagnostic material for each test.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on this analysis, Option A is the only workflow that adheres strictly to all the scientific and logistical requirements laid out in the problem statement for all three diagnostic modalities.",

The proliferation index by Ki-67 is approximately $90\\%$. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) studies for *MYC*, *BCL2*, and *BCL6* rearrangements are pending.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Patient Context**: Suspected Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma (DLBCL).\n-   **Histology**: Lymph node excision shows sheets of large lymphoid cells.\n-   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC) Data**:\n    -   Nuclear MYC staining: Strong in approximately $60\\%$ of tumor cells.\n    -   Cytoplasmic BCL2 staining: Strong in approximately $80\\%$ of tumor cells.\n-   **Proliferation Index**: Ki-67 is approximately $90\\%$.\n-   **Genetic Testing Status**: Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for *MYC*, *BCL2*, and *BCL6* rearrangements is pending.\n-   **Core Principles**: The explanation must be based on the Central Dogma of molecular biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein) and the methodological differences between IHC and FISH.\n-   **Question**: To identify the statement that best differentiates a “double expresser” DLBCL from a “double-hit” lymphoma and guides the next steps.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of pathology, molecular biology, and oncology. The entities (DLBCL, \"double-hit lymphoma\", \"double expresser\" lymphoma), genes (*MYC*, *BCL2*, *BCL6*), laboratory techniques (IHC, FISH), and cellular markers (Ki-67) are standard in the diagnosis and classification of B-cell lymphomas. The presented IHC and Ki-67 values are clinically realistic for a high-grade lymphoma. The reference to the Central Dogma as a foundational principle is appropriate. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a common clinical scenario where initial protein-level data (IHC) is available, but definitive genetic data (FISH) is pending. The question asks for a conceptual clarification between two distinct but related entities, which is critical for diagnosis, prognostication, and management. A unique, correct answer exists based on current medical and scientific definitions (specifically, the WHO Classification of Haematolymphoid Tumours).\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the relationship between a gene, its rearrangement, and its protein product, as dictated by the Central Dogma of molecular biology, and how different laboratory techniques probe different stages of this process.\n\n1.  **The Central Dogma and Associated Techniques**:\n    -   The Central Dogma states the flow of genetic information is from DNA (gene) to RNA (transcription) to protein (translation).\n    -   **Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)** is a cytogenetic technique that assesses the DNA level. It uses fluorescent DNA probes to locate, quantify, or detect structural abnormalities of specific genes or chromosomal regions. A **gene rearrangement**, such as a translocation where a gene is moved to a new chromosomal location, is a change at the DNA level detected by FISH.\n    -   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)** is a technique that detects proteins in tissue sections. It uses antibodies that specifically bind to the target protein, which is then visualized. IHC measures the level and location of **protein expression**, the final product of the gene expression pathway.\n\n2.  **Defining the Pathologic Entities**:\n    -   **\"Double-Hit\" Lymphoma (DHL)**: This is a formal diagnostic category of High-Grade B-cell Lymphoma (HGBL). By definition, its diagnosis *requires* the demonstration of specific **gene rearrangements** at the DNA level. Specifically, it is defined as a B-cell lymphoma with a rearrangement of the *MYC* gene plus a rearrangement of the *BCL2* gene and/or the *BCL6* gene. The diagnosis is therefore dependent on the results of a genetic test like FISH.\n    -   **\"Double Expresser\" Lymphoma (DEL)**: This is not a distinct disease entity in the same way as DHL, but rather a prognostic descriptor for a subset of DLBCL, Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). It is defined by the co-overexpression of the MYC and BCL2 **proteins**, as measured by IHC. The commonly accepted, albeit not universally standardized, thresholds are MYC protein expression in $\\geq 40\\%$ of tumor cells and BCL2 protein expression in $\\geq 50\\%$ of tumor cells.\n\n3.  **Relating DHL and DEL**:\n    -   A gene rearrangement (e.g., a translocation of *MYC* to an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene locus) is a frequent cause of its constitutive and high-level transcription, leading to protein overexpression. Thus, a \"double-hit\" lymphoma (with *MYC* and *BCL2* rearrangements) will almost invariably show overexpression of MYC and BCL2 proteins and thus be a \"double expresser\" by IHC.\n    -   However, the converse is not true. Protein overexpression (the \"double expresser\" phenotype) can be caused by mechanisms other than gene rearrangement. These mechanisms include gene amplification, mutations in promoter or enhancer regions, or dysregulation of upstream signaling pathways that increase transcription or post-translational modifications that increase protein stability.\n    -   Therefore, demonstrating protein overexpression via IHC (a \"double expresser\") does not prove the existence of an underlying gene rearrangement (a \"double-hit\"). The \"double expresser\" category is larger and contains the \"double-hit\" category as a subset.\n\n4.  **Application to the Present Case**:\n    -   IHC shows MYC in ~$60\\%$ of cells and BCL2 in ~$80\\%$ of cells. Both values exceed the conventional thresholds ($40\\%$ for MYC, $50\\%$ for BCL2$). Thus, this case **is a \"double expresser\" lymphoma** based on the provided IHC data.\n    -   The FISH studies, which are required to detect the gene rearrangements that define a \"double-hit\" lymphoma, are pending.\n    -   Therefore, we cannot diagnose \"double-hit\" lymphoma at this time. The IHC findings are a strong indicator that \"double-hit\" lymphoma is a possibility, which justifies performing the FISH test. The primary task is to wait for the FISH results to establish or rule out the definitive diagnosis of HGBL with *MYC* and *BCL2*/*BCL6* rearrangements.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A “double expresser” is defined by protein overexpression thresholds on IHC and does not by itself establish the presence of MYC or BCL2 gene rearrangements; a “double-hit” requires demonstration of MYC rearrangement with BCL2 and/or BCL6 by FISH.**\nThis statement is perfectly accurate. It correctly defines \"double expresser\" by its methodology (IHC) and biological level (protein), and \"double-hit\" by its methodology (FISH) and biological level (DNA rearrangement). It correctly states that protein-level data is not sufficient to diagnose a gene-level alteration. This aligns precisely with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Any tumor with MYC protein expression in more than $40\\%$ of cells must harbor a *MYC* gene rearrangement, so FISH is unnecessary.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It posits a direct and absolute equivalence between protein overexpression and gene rearrangement. As explained, MYC protein overexpression can occur via multiple mechanisms, rearrangement being only one. Therefore, FISH testing is not unnecessary; it is mandatory to test for the gene rearrangement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. BCL2 protein overexpression is pathognomonic for a *BCL2* gene rearrangement; thus this case meets criteria for “double-hit lymphoma.”**\nThis statement contains two errors. First, similar to option B, BCL2 protein overexpression is not pathognomonic for a *BCL2* gene rearrangement. Second, even if it were, a \"double-hit lymphoma\" requires a *MYC* rearrangement *in addition* to a *BCL2* rearrangement. The diagnosis cannot be made on the basis of *BCL2* status alone, and it requires genetic confirmation for both hits.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. “Double expresser” and “double-hit” lymphomas are interchangeable terms describing the same biologic entity; both are defined solely by a high proliferation index.**\nThis statement is incorrect on all counts. \"Double expresser\" and \"double-hit\" are not interchangeable; they are distinct categories defined at the protein and DNA levels, respectively, with different clinical implications. Furthermore, neither is defined by the proliferation index (Ki-67). While they typically have a high proliferation rate (as seen in this case with Ki-67 of $90\\%$), this is a common feature, not the defining criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. If FISH testing does not detect a *MYC* rearrangement, the MYC IHC result must be a false positive and the case cannot be a “double expresser.”**\nThis statement misunderstands the relationship between the tests. If FISH is negative for a *MYC* rearrangement, it means the observed MYC protein overexpression is due to a non-rearrangement mechanism. The IHC result, which measures the actual protein present, is a true positive for protein overexpression. The case would still be classified as a \"double expresser\" (defined by IHC) but would be ruled out as a \"double-hit\" lymphoma (unless a *BCL6* rearrangement was present with *MYC*, but the premise focuses on the *MYC* rearrangement being absent).\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

This criterion is met.\n    Score for Stage = $1$.\n\n3.  **Serum LDH:** The criterion for an adverse feature is an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level. The problem states the patient has \"elevated serum LDH\". This criterion is met.\n    Score for LDH = $1$.\n\n4.  **ECOG Performance Status:** The criterion for an adverse feature is an ECOG performance status greater than or equal to $2$. The patient's ECOG status is $2$. Since $2 \\ge 2$, this criterion is met.\n    Score for ECOG Status = $1$.\n\n5.  **Number of Extranodal Sites:** The criterion for an adverse feature is involvement of more than $1$ extranodal site. The patient has involvement of $2$ extranodal sites. Since $2 > 1$, this criterion is met.\n    Score for Extranodal Sites = $1$.\n\nThe total IPI score is the sum of the scores for each of the five features.\n$$ \\text{IPI Score} = (\\text{Score for Age}) + (\\text{Score for Stage}) + (\\text{Score for LDH}) + (\\text{Score for ECOG}) + (\\text{Score for Extranodal Sites}) $$\n$$ \\text{IPI Score} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 $$\nThe IPI score for this patient is $5$.",
