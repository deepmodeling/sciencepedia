This first practice challenges you to distinguish between the two main subtypes of granulosa cell tumor—adult and juvenile—based on a set of classic histopathologic features .

            "problem": "A pathologist is asked to create a rule-based histopathologic rubric to separate juvenile granulosa cell tumor from adult granulosa cell tumor of the ovary using four attributes: follicle morphology, cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, and reticulin network distribution. The rubric must be internally consistent with core definitions in tumor pathology, specifically that proliferative rate is reflected by the mitotic index, that cytologic atypia is assessed by nuclear size, shape, chromatin, and nucleoli, and that reticulin staining highlights the extracellular matrix pattern produced by sex cord–stromal elements rather than investing individual granulosa cells. The pathologist will apply a threshold mitotic index measured as the number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields (HPF).\n\nWhich option most accurately specifies a rubric that distinguishes juvenile granulosa cell tumor from adult granulosa cell tumor along these four axes?\n\nA. Adult granulosa cell tumor: predominantly microfollicular architecture with Call-Exner-like bodies; nuclei with characteristic longitudinal grooves and generally mild cytologic atypia; mitotic index typically low, $\\leq 5$ per 10 HPF; reticulin staining shows a fine network rim accentuating the periphery of microfollicles and small nests rather than investing individual tumor cells. Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: predominantly macrofollicular or nodular architecture with irregular, larger follicle-like spaces and absence of classic Call-Exner bodies; rounder nuclei lacking grooves with moderate to marked atypia; mitotic index commonly elevated, $\\geq 10$ per 10 HPF; reticulin staining shows a coarser, thicker network encasing larger lobules and follicle-like structures, not pericellular.\n\nB. Adult granulosa cell tumor: predominantly macrofollicular architecture without call-Exner bodies; nuclei round without grooves and moderate atypia; mitotic index commonly elevated, $\\geq 10$ per 10 HPF; reticulin staining is coarse around lobules. Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: predominantly microfollicular with frequent Call-Exner bodies; nuclei with grooves and mild atypia; mitotic index low, $\\leq 5$ per 10 HPF; reticulin staining delicate around small nests.\n\nC. Adult granulosa cell tumor: marked cytologic atypia with pleomorphic nuclei lacking grooves; mitotic index very high, $\\geq 15$ per 10 HPF; reticulin invests individual tumor cells in a pericellular pattern. Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: mild cytologic atypia with nuclear grooves; mitotic index low, $\\leq 3$ per 10 HPF; reticulin only highlights the periphery of nests.\n\nD. Adult granulosa cell tumor: microfollicular architecture but with reticulin strictly pericellular investing individual tumor cells; mitotic index elevated, $\\geq 10$ per 10 HPF; nuclei round without grooves and moderate atypia. Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: macrofollicular architecture with Call-Exner bodies; mitotic index low, $\\leq 5$ per 10 HPF; reticulin network delicate around microfollicles.\n\nE. Adult granulosa cell tumor: microfollicular architecture with Call-Exner bodies and nuclear grooves but with moderate cytologic atypia and mitotic index commonly elevated, $\\geq 12$ per 10 HPF; reticulin coarse and lobule-encasing.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Context**: A pathologist needs to create a rubric to distinguish juvenile granulosa cell tumor (JGCT) from adult granulosa cell tumor (AGCT).\n- **Attributes for Rubric**: Follicle morphology, cytologic atypia, mitotic activity, and reticulin network distribution.\n- **Core Definitions**:\n    - Mitotic index reflects proliferation rate.\n    - Cytologic atypia is judged on nuclear features (size, shape, chromatin, nucleoli).\n    - Reticulin stain highlights extracellular matrix patterns, not individual granulosa cells.\n- **Objective**: Identify the option that accurately specifies a rubric distinguishing JGCT from AGCT based on these attributes and definitions.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of gynecologic pathology. The distinction between AGCT and JGCT is a classic and clinically important one, and the features listed (follicle type, nuclear morphology, mitotic rate, reticulin pattern) are the standard criteria used in diagnosis.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated. It provides a set of criteria and asks the user to select the correct combination of features for each tumor type. The core definitions provided act as axioms to guide the choice, ensuring a single best answer can be logically deduced.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses standard, objective pathological terminology. It quantifies mitotic index (mitoses per 10 HPF) to provide a clear threshold.\n\nThe problem is valid as it presents a realistic and well-defined diagnostic challenge. The solution will proceed by establishing the canonical features of AGCT and JGCT and comparing them against the options.\n\n### Derivation of a Principle-Based Rubric\nFrom the principles of ovarian tumor pathology:\n- **Adult Granulosa Cell Tumor (AGCT)** is characterized by:\n    - **Follicle Morphology**: Predominantly microfollicular, featuring the pathognomonic **Call-Exner bodies** (small, rosette-like structures with eosinophilic material). Other patterns like trabecular or solid can be seen.\n    - **Cytologic Atypia**: Generally mild. The key feature is the nucleus: pale, oval, and exhibiting characteristic longitudinal **nuclear grooves (\"coffee-bean nuclei\")**.\n    - **Mitotic Activity**: Typically low. A threshold of $\\leq 5$ mitoses per 10 HPF is a common guide.\n    - **Reticulin Network**: The stain highlights the basement membrane material, outlining small nests and the periphery of microfollicles. It does not typically surround individual tumor cells (a pericellular pattern is absent).\n- **Juvenile Granulosa Cell Tumor (JGCT)** is characterized by:\n    - **Follicle Morphology**: Predominantly macrofollicular (large, irregular, fluid-filled follicles) or a solid, nodular growth pattern. Classic Call-Exner bodies are absent.\n    - **Cytologic Atypia**: Often moderate to marked. The nuclei are round, hyperchromatic, lack grooves, and frequently show prominent nucleoli.\n    - **Mitotic Activity**: Commonly elevated and often brisk. A threshold of $\\geq 10$ mitoses per 10 HPF is frequently met or exceeded.\n    - **Reticulin Network**: The network is often coarser, encasing larger nodules or the large, irregular follicle-like structures.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Adult granulosa cell tumor: predominantly microfollicular architecture with Call-Exner-like bodies; nuclei with characteristic longitudinal grooves and generally mild cytologic atypia; mitotic index typically low, $\\leq 5$ per $10$ HPF; reticulin staining shows a fine network rim accentuating the periphery of microfollicles and small nests... Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: predominantly macrofollicular or nodular architecture... rounder nuclei lacking grooves with moderate to marked atypia; mitotic index commonly elevated, $\\geq 10$ per $10$ HPF; reticulin staining shows a coarser, thicker network...**\n- **Analysis**: This option accurately describes all four features for both AGCT and JGCT, consistent with the established pathological criteria derived above.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Adult granulosa cell tumor: predominantly macrofollicular architecture without call-Exner bodies; ... mitotic index commonly elevated... Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: predominantly microfollicular with frequent Call-Exner bodies; ... mitotic index low...**\n- **Analysis**: This option incorrectly swaps the key features of AGCT and JGCT.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Adult granulosa cell tumor: marked cytologic atypia with pleomorphic nuclei lacking grooves; mitotic index very high... reticulin invests individual tumor cells...**\n- **Analysis**: This option incorrectly describes AGCT. Marked atypia, high mitoses, and pericellular reticulin are not features of typical AGCT.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Adult granulosa cell tumor: microfollicular architecture but with reticulin strictly pericellular investing individual tumor cells; mitotic index elevated... nuclei round without grooves...**\n- **Analysis**: This option mischaracterizes AGCT with pericellular reticulin, high mitoses, and round nuclei. It also incorrectly associates Call-Exner bodies with JGCT in the second half of the option.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Adult granulosa cell tumor: ...mitotic index commonly elevated, $\\geq 12$ per $10$ HPF... Juvenile granulosa cell tumor: ...mild cytologic atypia with nuclear grooves; mitotic index low...**\n- **Analysis**: This option incorrectly assigns a high mitotic index to AGCT and incorrectly assigns nuclear grooves and low mitotic index to JGCT.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

This problem asks you to construct a step-wise, tiered IHC algorithm to solve a common diagnostic dilemma: separating a sex cord–stromal tumor from a mimicking epithelial carcinoma . This exercise will build your understanding of how to use a panel of protein markers in a logical sequence to maximize diagnostic certainty and conserve precious tissue.",

            "problem": "A diagnostician is asked to classify an ovarian neoplasm on limited biopsy. The hematoxylin and eosin sections show solid nests and trabeculae with scant cytoplasm and grooved nuclei, but the morphology is not definitive for either a sex cord–stromal tumor (SCST) or a Müllerian epithelial tumor. Because tissue is scarce, the pathologist plans a tiered immunohistochemistry (IHC) workflow to maximize specificity while minimizing false positives. The workflow will be staged in three tiers: first Inhibin and Calretinin; second Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF1) and Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1); and finally Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and Cytokeratin 7 (CK7). For the purposes of the decision rules, “diffuse positivity” is defined as staining in greater than 50% of lesional cells, and “focal” is less than or equal to 50%.\n\nUse the following foundational facts to construct your answer:\n- Immunohistochemistry detects lineage-defining proteins whose expression reflects differentiation programs governed by transcriptional regulation; thus, steroidogenic lineage differentiation typically yields Inhibin, Calretinin, and SF1 expression, while epithelial differentiation typically yields EMA and CK7 expression.\n- Specificity generally increases when multiple independent lineage-concordant markers are concordantly positive and conflicting lineage markers are absent; conversely, isolated or focal reactivity to a single marker can be nonspecific.\n- WT1 is a nuclear transcription factor commonly expressed in serous Müllerian epithelium and can be positive in some SCST; therefore, WT1 must be interpreted in the context of SF1 and epithelial marker status.\n\nWhich of the following tiered decision algorithms best operationalizes these principles to distinguish SCST from Müllerian epithelial tumors in a conservative, specificity-preserving manner?\n\nA. Tier $1$: If at least one of Inhibin or Calretinin is diffuse positive, suspect SCST; if both are negative or only focal, remain noncommittal. Tier $2$: Require SF1 nuclear positivity to confirm SCST; if SF1 is negative and WT1 is diffusely positive, favor Müllerian serous lineage; if WT1 is negative or only focal, remain noncommittal without SF1 support. Tier $3$: Finalize the call by requiring EMA negativity and CK7 negativity or only focal CK7 to support SCST; if EMA and CK7 are both diffuse positive, classify as Müllerian even if Calretinin was positive in Tier $1$.\n\nB. Tier $1$: Any Calretinin positivity (diffuse or focal) is sufficient to diagnose SCST and no further tiers are necessary; if Calretinin is negative, proceed to Tier $2$. Tier $2$: If WT1 is positive, diagnose SCST; if WT1 is negative, diagnose Müllerian. Tier $3$: EMA and CK7 are not needed.\n\nC. Tier $1$: If both Inhibin and Calretinin are negative, diagnose Müllerian; if either is positive, proceed to Tier $2$. Tier $2$: If WT1 is positive, diagnose SCST; if WT1 is negative, diagnose Müllerian. Tier $3$: Use EMA and CK7 only to subclassify Müllerian tumors and do not use them to adjudicate SCST versus Müllerian.\n\nD. Tier $1$: Diagnose SCST only if both Inhibin and Calretinin are diffuse positive; otherwise diagnose Müllerian. Tier $2$: SF1 negativity strengthens the SCST diagnosis; WT1 positivity also supports SCST because WT1 is a gonadal marker. Tier $3$: EMA or CK7 positivity should be ignored due to frequent keratin expression in SCST.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated for validity before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Context**: Classification of an ovarian neoplasm with ambiguous morphology between a sex cord–stromal tumor (SCST) and a Müllerian epithelial tumor.\n- **Morphology**: \"solid nests and trabeculae with scant cytoplasm and grooved nuclei\".\n- **Method**: A tiered immunohistochemistry (IHC) workflow on a scarce tissue sample.\n- **IHC Tiers**:\n  - Tier $1$: Inhibin, Calretinin.\n  - Tier $2$: Steroidogenic Factor $1$ (SF1), Wilms Tumor $1$ (WT1).\n  - Tier $3$: Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA), Cytokeratin $7$ (CK7).\n- **Definitions**:\n  - \"diffuse positivity\": staining in greater than 50% of lesional cells.\n  - \"focal\" positivity: staining in less than or equal to 50% of lesional cells.\n- **Foundational Fact 1**: Steroidogenic lineage (SCST) typically expresses Inhibin, Calretinin, and SF1. Epithelial lineage (Müllerian) typically expresses EMA and CK7.\n- **Foundational Fact 2**: Specificity increases with multiple concordant positive markers and absence of conflicting lineage markers. Isolated or focal reactivity can be nonspecific.\n- **Foundational Fact 3**: WT1 is expressed in serous Müllerian epithelium and some SCSTs. Its interpretation requires context from SF1 and epithelial markers.\n- **Objective**: Identify the tiered decision algorithm that best operationalizes these principles in a \"conservative, specificity-preserving manner\".\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly grounded in diagnostic pathology, a field within biomedical science. The differential diagnosis between SCST and Müllerian epithelial tumors (especially carcinomas) is a common and important one. The chosen IHC markers (Inhibin, Calretinin, SF1, WT1, EMA, CK7) are standard and their described lineage associations are factually correct. The principles of tiered testing, marker specificity, and interpretation of marker panels are central to modern pathology practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of facts and principles and asks for the logical application of these to select the best algorithm from a list of options. A unique best answer can be determined by systematically comparing each option against the provided rules.\n- **Objective**: The problem uses precise, objective, and technical language common to the field. It provides a quantitative definition for \"diffuse\" versus \"focal\" staining ($>50\\%$ vs. $\\le 50\\%$). The foundational facts are presented as axioms for the purpose of solving the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective, presenting a realistic and solvable challenge in diagnostic reasoning based on established principles of pathology. The solution will proceed by deriving the optimal algorithm from the given principles and then evaluating each option.\n\n### Derivation of a Principle-Based Algorithm\nTo be \"conservative\" and \"specificity-preserving\", the algorithm must prioritize avoiding false-positive diagnoses of SCST. This entails requiring strong, concordant positive evidence for SCST while also demanding negative evidence for the primary alternative, a Müllerian tumor.\n\n1.  **Initial Screen (Tier $1$)**: Based on Fact $1$, Inhibin and Calretinin are SCST markers. Fact $2$ cautions against relying on \"isolated or focal reactivity\". Therefore, a conservative first step is to look for strong expression of these markers. Diffuse positivity ($>50\\%$) in at least one would be sufficient to \"suspect\" SCST and warrant further workup. If both are negative or only focally positive, the evidence for SCST is weak, and one should remain noncommittal or lean towards the alternative diagnosis, pending more data.\n\n2.  **Confirmation and Context (Tier $2$)**: This tier should use more specific markers to confirm the suspected lineage and resolve ambiguity.\n    -   **SF1**: Fact $1$ lists SF1 as a steroidogenic lineage marker. In pathology, it is known to be a highly specific nuclear transcription factor for gonadal stromal and adrenocortical cells. Thus, SF1 positivity serves as excellent confirmation for an SCST diagnosis.\n    -   **WT1**: Fact $3$ states WT1 is tricky, being positive in both serous Müllerian tumors and some SCSTs, and must be interpreted in context. If SF1 is positive (strong SCST evidence), WT1 positivity is merely consistent. However, if SF1 is *negative*, then diffuse WT1 positivity becomes highly suspicious for a serous Müllerian tumor. A conservative algorithm must use WT1 this way, not as a primary marker for SCST.\n\n3.  **Exclusion and Finalization (Tier $3$)**: To maximize specificity for SCST, the algorithm must demonstrate the absence of the conflicting lineage. Fact $2$ emphasizes this.\n    -   **EMA and CK7**: These are epithelial markers (Fact $1$). A definitive SCST diagnosis should ideally show negativity for both EMA and CK7. Aberrant focal expression can sometimes occur, so negativity or only focal staining for these markers would be required to support an SCST diagnosis.\n    -   Conversely, diffuse positivity for both EMA and CK7 is strong evidence for a Müllerian epithelial tumor. This finding should override ambiguous or weak evidence for an SCST (e.g., focal Calretinin positivity alone).\n\nThis logical construction provides a robust framework against which the options can be judged.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Tier $1$: If at least one of Inhibin or Calretinin is diffuse positive, suspect SCST; if both are negative or only focal, remain noncommittal. Tier $2$: Require SF1 nuclear positivity to confirm SCST; if SF1 is negative and WT1 is diffusely positive, favor Müllerian serous lineage; if WT1 is negative or only focal, remain noncommittal without SF1 support. Tier $3$: Finalize the call by requiring EMA negativity and CK7 negativity or only focal CK7 to support SCST; if EMA and CK7 are both diffuse positive, classify as Müllerian even if Calretinin was positive in Tier $1$.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This algorithm aligns perfectly with the derived principles.\n    - Tier $1$ correctly uses diffuse positivity as a meaningful threshold and appropriately handles weak or negative results by remaining noncommittal, consistent with Fact $2$.\n    - Tier $2$ correctly employs the highly specific marker SF1 for confirmation and accurately interprets WT1 in a context-dependent manner, as mandated by Fact $3$.\n    - Tier $3$ correctly uses epithelial markers (EMA, CK7) as exclusionary criteria to finalize the SCST diagnosis and rightly gives strong, diffuse epithelial marker expression the power to override earlier, weaker evidence for SCST. This embodies the specificity-preserving approach from Fact $2$.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Tier $1$: Any Calretinin positivity (diffuse or focal) is sufficient to diagnose SCST and no further tiers are necessary; if Calretinin is negative, proceed to Tier $2$. Tier $2$: If WT1 is positive, diagnose SCST; if WT1 is negative, diagnose Müllerian. Tier $3$: EMA and CK7 are not needed.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This algorithm is severely flawed.\n    - Tier $1$ violates Fact $2$ by making a final diagnosis based on potentially nonspecific focal staining of a single marker. This is not a conservative approach.\n    - Tier $2$ makes a critical error by using WT1 positivity to diagnose SCST. This directly contradicts Fact $3$, which notes that WT1 is commonly expressed in serous Müllerian tumors.\n    - The claim that EMA and CK7 are \"not needed\" violates the principles of using concordant markers and excluding conflicting lineages (Facts $1$ and $2$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Tier $1$: If both Inhibin and Calretinin are negative, diagnose Müllerian; if either is positive, proceed to Tier $2$. Tier $2$: If WT1 is positive, diagnose SCST; if WT1 is negative, diagnose Müllerian. Tier $3$: Use EMA and CK7 only to subclassify Müllerian tumors and do not use them to adjudicate SCST versus Müllerian.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This algorithm is also deeply flawed.\n    - Tier $1$ makes a diagnosis of Müllerian tumor based on the *absence* of SCST markers, which is improper. A positive diagnosis should be based on positive findings (i.e., epithelial markers).\n    - Tier $2$ repeats the same critical error as option B, misinterpreting WT1 as a specific marker for SCST, contrary to Fact $3$.\n    - Tier $3$ improperly restricts the use of EMA and CK7, which are essential for the primary SCST vs. Müllerian differential (Fact $1$), not just for subclassification. This violates the principle of using a full panel to resolve lineage (Fact $2$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Tier $1$: Diagnose SCST only if both Inhibin and Calretinin are diffuse positive; otherwise diagnose Müllerian. Tier $2$: SF1 negativity strengthens the SCST diagnosis; WT1 positivity also supports SCST because WT1 is a gonadal marker. Tier $3$: EMA or CK7 positivity should be ignored due to frequent keratin expression in SCST.**\n\n- **Analysis**: This algorithm is replete with errors and statements that are contrary to the foundational facts.\n    - Tier $1$ makes a premature final diagnosis of Müllerian tumor based on incomplete evidence.\n    - The statement in Tier $2$ that \"SF1 negativity strengthens the SCST diagnosis\" is the opposite of the truth; SF1 is a key positive marker according to Fact $1$. The interpretation of WT1 is again an oversimplification that ignores Fact $3$.\n    - Tier $3$'s instruction to \"ignore\" EMA or CK7 positivity is reckless and violates Fact $2$. Diffuse epithelial marker expression is a critical finding that cannot be disregarded.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

The probability of a positive test for these types, often called the false positive rate for a given condition, is $1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n- For thecoma/fibroma (T): $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{T}) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\mathrm{T}) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\n- For Sertoli–Leydig cell tumor (S): $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{S}) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\mathrm{S}) = 1 - 0.97 = 0.03$.\n- For juvenile granulosa cell tumor (J): $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{J}) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\mathrm{J}) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n- For other SCSTs (O): $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{O}) = 1 - P(- \\mid \\mathrm{O}) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$.\n\nNow, we can substitute all the known values to calculate $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (0.96)(0.45) + (0.01)(0.25) + (0.03)(0.15) + (0.02)(0.10) + (0.02)(0.05)\n$$\nWe compute each term:\n- $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{AGCT})P(\\mathrm{AGCT}) = (0.96)(0.45) = 0.432$\n- $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{T})P(\\mathrm{T}) = (0.01)(0.25) = 0.0025$\n- $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{S})P(\\mathrm{S}) = (0.03)(0.15) = 0.0045$\n- $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{J})P(\\mathrm{J}) = (0.02)(0.10) = 0.0020$\n- $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{O})P(\\mathrm{O}) = (0.02)(0.05) = 0.0010$\n\nSumming these values gives the total probability of a positive test:\n$$\nP(+) = 0.432 + 0.0025 + 0.0045 + 0.0020 + 0.0010 = 0.4420\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the numerator, $P(+ \\mid \\mathrm{AGCT})P(\\mathrm{AGCT}) = 0.432$, and the denominator, $P(+) = 0.4420$, back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{AGCT} \\mid +) = \\frac{0.432}{0.4420}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{AGCT} \\mid +) \\approx 0.97737556561...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{AGCT} \\mid +) \\approx 0.9774\n$$\nThis is the posterior probability that the tumor is an AGCT given the positive FOXL2 mutation result.",
