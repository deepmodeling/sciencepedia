            "problem": "A surgical pathology laboratory evaluates the diagnostic performance of loss of E-cadherin expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for distinguishing Invasive Lobular Carcinoma (ILC) from Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). E-cadherin loss is considered a positive test result for ILC. The following dataset summarizes IHC findings verified against gold-standard histologic diagnoses on core biopsies:\n\nAmong $120$ biopsy-proven ILC cases, E-cadherin loss (test positive) is observed in $108$ cases; the remaining $12$ ILC cases retain E-cadherin (test negative). Among $200$ biopsy-proven IDC cases, E-cadherin loss is observed in $18$ cases; the remaining $182$ IDC cases retain E-cadherin. Let disease $D$ denote ILC and non-disease $\\neg D$ denote IDC. Let $T^{+}$ denote E-cadherin loss and $T^{-}$ denote retained E-cadherin.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of conditional probability $P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$ and the standard meanings of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts, do the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "### Solution\nThe problem asks for two tasks: first, to derive the formulas for Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) from first principles; and second, to calculate sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV from the given data.\n\nLet us organize the provided counts into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table.\n- $D$: Presence of disease (ILC)\n- $\\neg D$: Absence of disease (i.e., presence of IDC)\n- $T^{+}$: Positive test result (E-cadherin loss)\n- $T^{-}$: Negative test result (retained E-cadherin)\n\nThe counts are:\n- True Positives ($TP$): Number of individuals with disease who test positive. $TP = 108$.\n- False Negatives ($FN$): Number of individuals with disease who test negative. $FN = 12$.\n- False Positives ($FP$): Number of individuals without disease who test positive. $FP = 18$.\n- True Negatives ($TN$): Number of individuals without disease who test negative. $TN = 182$.\n\nThe total number of subjects in the study is $N = TP + FN + FP + TN = 108 + 12 + 18 + 182 = 320$.\n\n#### 1. Derivation of PPV and NPV\n\nWe use the frequentist interpretation of probability, where the probability of an event $A$ is the ratio of the number of outcomes in $A$ to the total number of outcomes, $N$.\n\n**Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)** is defined as the probability of having the disease given a positive test result, which is $P(D \\mid T^{+})$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T^{+})}{P(T^{+})}$.\n\nThe event $(D \\cap T^{+})$ corresponds to subjects who have the disease AND test positive, which is the definition of a true positive. The number of such subjects is $TP$. Therefore, the probability of this joint event is:\n$$P(D \\cap T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Total Number of Subjects}} = \\frac{TP}{N}$$\n\nThe event $T^{+}$ corresponds to all subjects who test positive, regardless of their disease status. This group includes both True Positives and False Positives. The total number of subjects with a positive test is $TP + FP$. Therefore, the probability of a positive test is:\n$$P(T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Positive Tests}}{\\text{Total Number of Subjects}} = \\frac{TP + FP}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the conditional probability formula for $PPV$:\n$$P(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{TP}{N}}{\\frac{TP + FP}{N}} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\nThis completes the derivation for PPV.\n\n**Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)** is defined as the probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, which is $P(\\neg D \\mid T^{-})$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(\\neg D \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap T^{-})}{P(T^{-})}$.\n\nThe event $(\\neg D \\cap T^{-})$ corresponds to subjects who do not have the disease AND test negative, which is the definition of a true negative. The number of such subjects is $TN$. The probability of this joint event is:\n$$P(\\neg D \\cap T^{-}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Number of Subjects}} = \\frac{TN}{N}$$\n\nThe event $T^{-}$ corresponds to all subjects who test negative. This group includes both True Negatives and False Negatives. The total number of subjects with a negative test is $TN + FN$. Therefore, the probability of a negative test is:\n$$P(T^{-}) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Negative Tests}}{\\text{Total Number of Subjects}} = \\frac{TN + FN}{N}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the conditional probability formula for $NPV$:\n$$P(\\neg D \\mid T^{-}) = \\frac{\\frac{TN}{N}}{\\frac{TN + FN}{N}} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FN}$$\nThis completes the derivation for NPV.\n\n#### 2. Calculation of Diagnostic Metrics\n\nNow, we will compute the four requested metrics using the provided counts: $TP=108$, $FN=12$, $FP=18$, $TN=182$.\n\n**Sensitivity**, also known as the True Positive Rate, is the probability of a positive test given that the subject has the disease, $P(T^{+} \\mid D)$.\nThe total number of subjects with the disease is $TP + FN = 108 + 12 = 120$.\n$$\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{108}{120} = 0.9$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.9000$.\n\n**Specificity**, also known as the True Negative Rate, is the probability of a negative test given that the subject does not have the disease, $P(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D)$.\nThe total number of subjects without the disease is $FP + TN = 18 + 182 = 200$.\n$$\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{FP + TN} = \\frac{182}{18 + 182} = \\frac{182}{200} = 0.91$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.9100$.\n\n**Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$)** is the probability of having the disease given a positive test, $P(D \\mid T^{+})$.\nThe total number of subjects with a positive test is $TP + FP = 108 + 18 = 126$.\nUsing the formula derived in Part 1:\n$$PPV = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{108}{126}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.8571428...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.8571$.\n\n**Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$)** is the probability of not having the disease given a negative test, $P(\\neg D \\mid T^{-})$.\nThe total number of subjects with a negative test is $TN + FN = 182 + 12 = 194$.\nUsing the formula derived in Part 1:\n$$NPV = \\frac{TN}{TN + FN} = \\frac{182}{194}$$\nAs a decimal, this is approximately $0.9381443...$. Rounded to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9381$.\n\nThe final answer is the ordered quadruple (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV).",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition anatomic pathologic stage group for a case of invasive breast carcinoma, based on the provided tumor ($T$), regional lymph node ($N$), and distant metastasis ($M$) information. The final stage group must be encoded into a specific integer.\n\nThe process involves a systematic determination of the pathologic $T$, $N$, and $M$ categories, followed by their combination to identify the anatomic stage group.\n\n1.  **Determination of the Pathologic Primary Tumor ($pT$) Category**\n\nThe $pT$ category is based on the size of the invasive component and its extension.\nThe givens are:\n-   The largest invasive focus measures $3.6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n-   There is no macroscopic invasion of the chest wall.\n-   There is no skin ulceration.\n-   Peau d’orange is noted, but without dermal tumor infiltration.\n\nAccording to the AJCC 8th edition rules for breast cancer:\n-   A $pT1$ tumor is $\\le 2\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n-   A $pT2$ tumor is $> 2\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ but $\\le 5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n-   A $pT3$ tumor is $> 5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ in greatest dimension.\n-   A $pT4$ tumor involves direct extension to the chest wall and/or skin (ulceration or nodules).

However, the AJCC manual clarifies that peau d’orange caused by lymphatic obstruction without direct tumor infiltration of the dermis does not qualify as $pT4b$. Since the problem explicitly states \"without dermal tumor infiltration,\" the criterion for $pT4b$ is not met.\n\nThe tumor size is $3.6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. Since $2\\ \\mathrm{cm} < 3.6\\ \\mathrm{cm} \\le 5\\ \\mathrm{cm}$, the tumor size corresponds to the $pT2$ category. Therefore, the primary tumor is classified as $pT2$.\n\n2.  **Determination of the Pathologic Regional Lymph Node ($pN$) Category**\n\nThe $pN$ category is based on the number and size of metastatic deposits in regional lymph nodes.\nThe givens are:\n-   $5$ out of $12$ axillary lymph nodes are positive for metastasis.\n-   Metastatic deposit sizes are $3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $4.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $2.4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $0.8\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and $1.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   Extranodal extension (ENE) is present but does not alter the $N$ category.\n\nAccording to AJCC 8th edition definitions:\n-   A macrometastasis is a deposit $> 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   A micrometastasis is a deposit $> 0.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ but $\\le 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   The deposits measuring $3.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $4.2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and $2.4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ are macrometastases.

There are $2$ such nodes.\n\nThe total number of positive lymph nodes is $3 + 2 = 5$.\n\nThe $pN$ categories are defined as follows:\n-   $pN1$: Metastasis in $1$–$3$ axillary lymph nodes.\n-   $pN2$: Metastasis in $4$–$9$ axillary lymph nodes. The subcategory $pN2a$ applies when at least one metastatic deposit is $> 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n-   $pN3$: Metastasis in $\\ge 10$ axillary lymph nodes.\n\nSince there are $5$ positive axillary lymph nodes, this case falls into the $pN2$ category. Because there are multiple macrometastases (deposits $> 2.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$), the criteria for $pN2a$ are met. For the purpose of Anatomic Stage Grouping, we use the main category $pN2$.\n\n3.  **Determination of the Distant Metastasis ($M$) Category**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that there is no clinical or radiologic evidence of distant metastasis and to treat this as $M0$. Therefore, the category is $M0$.\n\n4.  **Determination of the Anatomic Stage Group**\n\nThe anatomic stage group is determined by combining the $pT$, $pN$, and $M$ categories using the AJCC 8th edition staging table.\n-   $pT$ category: $pT2$\n-   $pN$ category: $pN2$\n-   $M$ category: $M0$\n\nThe combination $T2\\ N2\\ M0$ corresponds to **Stage IIIA**.\n\n5.  **Encoding the Final Answer**\n\nThe problem provides a mapping to encode the stage group into an integer:\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IA} \\mapsto 1$\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IB} \\mapsto 2$\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IIA} \\mapsto 3$\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IIB} \\mapsto 4$\n-   **Stage $\\mathrm{IIIA} \\mapsto 5$**\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IIIB} \\mapsto 6$\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IIIC} \\mapsto 7$\n-   Stage $\\mathrm{IV} \\mapsto 8$\n\nThe determined Anatomic Stage Group is IIIA, which maps to the integer $5$.",

ILC's characteristic single-file infiltrative growth pattern, a direct result of E-cadherin loss, notoriously leads to its underestimation by mammography, creating a significant challenge for surgical planning. This exercise will allow you to quantify this imaging-pathology discrepancy and articulate the crucial link between microscopic morphology and the real-world surgical goal of achieving complete tumor removal .",

            "problem": "In invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast, the final surgical pathology size is considered the best proxy for the true tumor extent because it reflects complete excision and direct microscopic measurement, whereas mammography yields a radiographic estimate that can be biased by the histologic growth pattern. Consider a cohort of $N = 150$ patients with ILC in which the mean largest tumor dimension on final pathology is $31.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and the mean largest tumor dimension on preoperative mammography is $22.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.

Your final numeric answer must be only the underestimation factor, as specified above.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for two components: first, the computation of a mammographic tumor size underestimation factor, and second, a clinicopathological explanation for this phenomenon and its surgical implications.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the Underestimation Factor\n\nWe are given the following data from a cohort of $N=150$ patients:\n- The mean largest tumor dimension on final pathology, which serves as the best proxy for the true tumor size: $\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{pathology}} = 31.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The mean largest tumor dimension on preoperative mammography: $\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{mammo}} = 22.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nA proportional measurement model is proposed, where the mammographic measurement, $S_{\\mathrm{mammo}}$, is related to the true size, $S_{\\mathrm{true}}$, by a constant multiplicative bias, $b$, such that:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mammo}} \\approx b \\, S_{\\mathrm{true}}$$\nGiven that final pathology is the proxy for true size, we can write $S_{\\mathrm{true}} \\approx S_{\\mathrm{pathology}}$. The model thus becomes:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{mammo}} \\approx b \\, S_{\\mathrm{pathology}}$$\nThe problem specifies that cohort means should be used as estimators for the expected values of these quantities. Applying the expectation operator to the model gives:\n$$E[S_{\\mathrm{mammo}}] \\approx b \\, E[S_{\\mathrm{pathology}}]$$\nSubstituting the sample means as estimators:\n$$\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{mammo}} \\approx b \\, \\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{pathology}}$$\nThe underestimation factor, $f$, is defined as \"the multiplicative factor by which mammography underestimates size relative to pathology.\" This implies that the true (pathology) size is $f$ times larger than the estimated (mammographic) size. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pathology}} = f \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{mammo}}$$\nUsing the cohort means to estimate this factor, we have:\n$$f = \\frac{\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{pathology}}}{\\bar{S}_{\\mathrm{mammo}}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$f = \\frac{31.2}{22.8}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$f \\approx 1.368421...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the mammographic tumor size underestimation factor is:\n$$f \\approx 1.368$$\nThis factor is a unitless quantity, as it is a ratio of two lengths measured in the same units ($\\mathrm{mm}$).\n\nPart 2: Pathological Basis and Surgical Implications\n\nThe systematic underestimation of tumor size in invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) by mammography is a direct consequence of its distinct histomorphology, which contrasts sharply with the more common invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).\n\nThe foundational principle at play is the role of cell-cell adhesion in tissue architecture. The majority ($>90\\%$) of ILC tumors exhibit a loss-of-function mutation in the gene $CDH1$, which codes for the protein E-cadherin. E-cadherin is a critical component of adherens junctions, which mediate strong homophilic binding between epithelial cells. The loss of functional E-cadherin results in a discohesive phenotype; the tumor cells lose their ability to adhere to one another.\n\nConsequently, instead of forming a cohesive, three-dimensional mass or glandular structures as is typical for IDC, ILC cells infiltrate the breast stroma as individual cells or in narrow, single-file linear arrays, a pattern often described as \"Indian files.\" This infiltrative, non-mass-forming growth pattern has two major consequences for radiographic imaging:\n1. Low Tumor Cell Density: The tumor cells are dispersed over a larger volume of tissue, resulting in a low average tumor cell density. Mammography detects lesions based on differences in X-ray attenuation, which correlates with tissue density. The diffuse nature of ILC often fails to create a focal mass dense enough to be clearly distinguished from the surrounding fibroglandular breast parenchyma.\n2. Minimal Desmoplastic Response: The infiltrative growth of ILC often incites little to no desmoplastic or fibrotic stromal reaction. In contrast, IDC frequently induces a significant desmoplastic response, creating a hard, fibrotic mass that is much more conspicuous on mammography, often appearing as a spiculated density. The lack of this reaction in ILC further contributes to its radiographic subtlety.\n\nThe computed underestimation factor $f \\approx 1.368$ quantifies this phenomenon at a cohort level, indicating that on average, the true pathological extent of the tumor is approximately $37\\%$ larger than its mammographic representation. This has profound implications for the planning of breast-conserving surgery (BCS), also known as lumpectomy.\n\nThe primary objective of BCS is the complete oncologic resection of the a tumor with a margin of surrounding healthy tissue (a \"negative margin\"), while maximizing breast cosmesis. The underestimation factor directly influences surgical strategy:\n1. Planning the Excision Volume: A surgeon cannot rely on the radiographic tumor size to plan the resection. If a mammogram indicates a lesion of size $S_{\\mathrm{mammo}}$, the surgeon must anticipate a true pathologic size of approximately $f \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{mammo}}$. The surgical plan must therefore target a much larger volume of tissue than would be suggested by the imaging alone. For a radiographically apparent $20 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ lesion, the surgeon should plan the resection as if the tumor were closer to $1.368 \\times 20 \\ \\mathrm{mm} \\approx 27.4 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$ in diameter.\n2. Margin Strategy: To achieve negative margins, the surgeon must excise a wider radial margin of tissue around the visible or palpable extent of the tumor. The knowledge of systematic underestimation necessitates a more aggressive initial resection to minimize the high risk of finding tumor cells at the specimen edge upon final pathology. This high risk of positive margins in ILC is a well-established clinical problem, often leading to the need for re-excision surgery.\n3. Adjunctive Imaging and Patient Counseling: The quantified unreliability of mammography for ILC size assessment fortifies the rationale for using more sensitive preoperative imaging modalities, such as breast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI is generally more accurate in delineating the extent of ILC. Furthermore, the surgeon must counsel the patient preoperatively about the high likelihood that the tumor is larger than it appears on the mammogram and the associated increased risk of positive margins and potential need for re-operation or even conversion to mastectomy if a satisfactory cosmetic result with clear margins is not feasible.",
