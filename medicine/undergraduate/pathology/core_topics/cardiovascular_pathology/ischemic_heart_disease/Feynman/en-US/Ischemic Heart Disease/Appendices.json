            "problem": "You are to implement a simplified systems model of myocardial oxygen supply–demand balance to simulate the heart rate threshold for the onset of angina and to evaluate whether angina is present at a given current heart rate. The clinical context is ischemic heart disease and the educational domain is pathology. The model must be derived from fundamental definitions and well-tested approximations without using shortcut formulas.\n\nBase facts to use:\n- Myocardial oxygen supply per unit time equals coronary blood flow multiplied by arterial oxygen content. Coronary blood flow primarily occurs during diastole.\n- Coronary Perfusion Pressure (CPP) is approximated by diastolic blood pressure minus left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Let left ventricular end-diastolic pressure be denoted $E$.\n- Coronary flow can be approximated as proportional to perfusion pressure times an effective conductance. In this simplified model, let baseline coronary conductance be a constant $G$.\n- Diastolic perfusion fraction is a function of heart rate $H$ because diastole shortens with increasing $H$. Let the diastolic fraction be $f_d(H)$.\n- Stenosis severity $s$ (expressed as a decimal fraction, not a percentage) reduces conductance. For simplicity, let the stenosis conductance multiplier be $F(s)$.\n- Arterial oxygen content $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$ depends on hemoglobin concentration and oxygen saturation. Use the well-tested approximation $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} \\approx 1.34 \\times \\mathrm{Hb}_{\\mathrm{g/L}} \\times S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} + 0.003 \\times P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$, where $\\mathrm{Hb}_{\\mathrm{g/L}}$ is hemoglobin concentration in grams per liter, $S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$ is arterial oxygen saturation, and $P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$ is arterial partial pressure of oxygen.\n- Myocardial oxygen demand is well-approximated by the Rate-Pressure Product (RPP), defined as heart rate times systolic blood pressure, scaled by a constant factor $k$ to convert to oxygen consumption per unit time.\n\nYou must:\n1. Define the following functions and constants in scientifically sound units:\n   - $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}(\\mathrm{Hb}) = 1.34 \\times (10 \\times \\mathrm{Hb}_{\\mathrm{g/dL}}) \\times S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} + 0.003 \\times P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$ in $\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/L\\ blood}$, using $S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.97$ and $P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 100$.\n   - $CPP = \\max(0, DBP - E)$ in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ with $E = 12$.\n   - $f_d(H) = \\mathrm{clip}(0.8 - 0.003 \\times H, 0.2, 0.8)$, unitless.\n   - $F(s) = 1 - s$, unitless.\n   - Coronary flow $Q(H) = G \\times CPP \\times f_d(H) \\times F(s)$ in $\\mathrm{L/min}$, using $G = 0.0045$ in $\\mathrm{L/(min\\cdot mmHg)}$.\n   - Myocardial oxygen supply $S(H) = Q(H) \\times C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$ in $\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/min}$.\n   - Myocardial oxygen demand $D(H) = k \\times H \\times SBP$ in $\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/min}$, using $k = 0.0025$.\n2. Define angina as present if $D(H) > S(H)$.\n3. Define the angina threshold heart rate $H^{\\ast}$ as the value of $H$ where $S(H) - D(H) = 0$, within the physiological range $[40, 200]$ beats per minute. If there is no crossing in the range and $S(H) > D(H)$ for all $H$ in this interval, set $H^{\\ast} = 200.0$. If $S(H) < D(H)$ for all $H$ in this interval, set $H^{\\ast} = 40.0$.\n\nYour program must compute, for each test case, the pair consisting of the threshold heart rate $H^{\\ast}$ in beats per minute and a boolean indicating whether angina is present at the given current heart rate.\n\nExpress the heart rate threshold output in beats per minute, rounded to one decimal place. All other outputs must be booleans.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case $1$: $SBP = 120$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $DBP = 80$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $H_{\\mathrm{current}} = 85$ $\\mathrm{bpm}$, $\\mathrm{Hb} = 15$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $s = 0.3$.\n- Case $2$: $SBP = 130$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $DBP = 75$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $H_{\\mathrm{current}} = 70$ $\\mathrm{bpm}$, $\\mathrm{Hb} = 15$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $s = 0.85$.\n- Case $3$: $SBP = 110$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $DBP = 70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $H_{\\mathrm{current}} = 100$ $\\mathrm{bpm}$, $\\mathrm{Hb} = 9$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $s = 0.4$.\n- Case $4$: $SBP = 90$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $DBP = 50$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $H_{\\mathrm{current}} = 100$ $\\mathrm{bpm}$, $\\mathrm{Hb} = 13$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $s = 0.5$.\n- Case $5$: $SBP = 140$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $DBP = 90$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, $H_{\\mathrm{current}} = 55$ $\\mathrm{bpm}$, $\\mathrm{Hb} = 16$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $s = 0.0$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is a two-item list $[H^{\\ast}, \\mathrm{angina}]$ for the corresponding test case, for example, $[[100.0,\\mathrm{True}],[140.0,\\mathrm{False}],\\dots]$.

            "solution": "The user-provided problem has been assessed and is valid. It is scientifically grounded in simplified physiological principles, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem asks us to develop a systems model for myocardial oxygen balance to determine the heart rate threshold for angina ($H^{\\ast}$) and to assess if angina is present at a given heart rate.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two main stages for each test case:\n1.  Calculate all parameters and define the oxygen supply and demand functions based on the provided inputs.\n2.  Use these functions to determine the angina status at the current heart rate and to calculate the angina threshold heart rate.\n\n### 1. Formulation of Oxygen Supply and Demand\n\nThe myocardial oxygen supply per minute, $S(H)$, is the product of coronary blood flow, $Q(H)$, and arterial oxygen content, $C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$. The demand, $D(H)$, is modeled as proportional to the rate-pressure product.\n\n**Arterial Oxygen Content ($C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$):**\nThis is constant for a given patient profile. It depends on hemoglobin concentration ($\\mathrm{Hb}$), arterial oxygen saturation ($S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$), and arterial partial pressure of oxygen ($P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$). The hemoglobin is given in $\\mathrm{g/dL}$ and must be converted to $\\mathrm{g/L}$ by multiplying by $10$.\nUsing the provided constants ($S_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 0.97$, $P_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$):\n$$\nC_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} = 1.34 \\times (10 \\times \\mathrm{Hb}_{\\mathrm{g/dL}}) \\times 0.97 + 0.003 \\times 100 \\ \\ [\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/L\\ blood}]\n$$\n\n**Coronary Perfusion Pressure ($CPP$):**\nThis is approximated as the diastolic blood pressure ($DBP$) minus the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure ($E = 12\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$).\n$$\nCPP = \\max(0, DBP - 12) \\ \\ [\\mathrm{mmHg}]\n$$\n\n**Myocardial Oxygen Supply ($S(H)$):**\nCoronary flow, $Q(H)$, occurs primarily during diastole and is modeled as proportional to $CPP$, diastolic time fraction $f_d(H)$, and conductance. The baseline conductance is $G = 0.0045\\ \\mathrm{L/(min \\cdot mmHg)}$, which is reduced by stenosis ($s$) by a factor $F(s) = 1 - s$. The diastolic time fraction $f_d(H)$ decreases with heart rate $H$:\n$$\nf_d(H) = \\mathrm{clip}(0.8 - 0.003 \\times H, 0.2, 0.8)\n$$\nThe coronary flow is then:\n$$\nQ(H) = G \\times CPP \\times f_d(H) \\times F(s) \\ \\ [\\mathrm{L/min}]\n$$\nAnd the oxygen supply is:\n$$\nS(H) = Q(H) \\times C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2} \\ \\ [\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/min}]\n$$\nFor a given patient, we can group the $H$-independent terms into a supply constant, $S_0 = G \\times CPP \\times F(s) \\times C_{a\\mathrm{O}_2}$.\n$$\nS(H) = S_0 \\times f_d(H)\n$$\n\n**Myocardial Oxygen Demand ($D(H)$):**\nDemand is approximated by the rate-pressure product ($H \\times SBP$) scaled by a conversion factor $k = 0.0025$.\n$$\nD(H) = k \\times H \\times SBP \\ \\ [\\mathrm{mL\\ O_2/min}]\n$$\nSimilarly, we can define a demand constant, $D_0 = k \\times SBP$, so that:\n$$\nD(H) = D_0 \\times H\n$$\n\n### 2. Calculation of Angina Status and Threshold\n\n**Angina Status at Current Heart Rate ($H_{\\mathrm{current}}$):**\nAngina is defined to be present if oxygen demand exceeds supply. We evaluate this condition at the given $H_{\\mathrm{current}}$:\n$$\n\\text{Angina Present} \\iff D(H_{\\mathrm{current}}) > S(H_{\\mathrm{current}})\n$$\n\n**Angina Threshold Heart Rate ($H^{\\ast}$):**\nThe threshold $H^{\\ast}$ is the heart rate at which supply equals demand, i.e., $S(H^{\\ast}) = D(H^{\\ast})$. We define a balance function $B(H) = S(H) - D(H)$ and find the root $H^{\\ast}$ where $B(H^{\\ast})=0$, within the physiological range $[40, 200]\\ \\mathrm{bpm}$.\n\nThe function $S(H)$ is a non-increasing function of $H$, while $D(H)$ is a strictly increasing linear function of $H$. Therefore, the balance function $B(H)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $H$ (except where $f_d(H)$ is constant). This guarantees at most one crossing point. The problem specifies the boundary conditions:\n-   If $S(H) < D(H)$ for all $H \\in [40, 200]$, then $H^{\\ast} = 40.0$. This is true if $B(40) \\le 0$.\n-   If $S(H) > D(H)$ for all $H \\in [40, 200]$, then $H^{\\ast} = 200.0$. This is true if $B(200) \\ge 0$.\n-   Otherwise, a unique root exists in the interval $(40, 200)$.\n\nIn the interval $H \\in (40, 200)$, the function $f_d(H)$ simplifies to the linear expression $0.8 - 0.003H$ because the clipping is not active. The equation $B(H)=0$ becomes:\n$$\nS_0 \\times (0.8 - 0.003H) - D_0 \\times H = 0\n$$\nSolving for $H$:\n$$\n0.8 \\times S_0 - 0.003 \\times S_0 \\times H = D_0 \\times H\n$$\n$$\n0.8 \\times S_0 = (D_0 + 0.003 \\times S_0) \\times H\n$$\n$$\nH^{\\ast} = \\frac{0.8 \\times S_0}{D_0 + 0.003 \\times S_0}\n$$\nThis analytical solution will be used to find $H^{\\ast}$ when the root lies within the specified interval. The final value is rounded to one decimal place.\n\nThe implementation will follow these steps for each test case, constructing the required output string from the results.",

The mean aortic (proximal) pressure is measured as $95$ mmHg, and the mean distal coronary pressure beyond a focal epicardial stenosis is measured as $68$ mmHg. Use the following foundational physiological bases:\n\n- Coronary blood flow can be modeled by an Ohm-type relation $Q = \\Delta P / R$, where $Q$ is flow, $\\Delta P$ is the perfusion pressure gradient, and $R$ is vascular resistance.\n- During pharmacologically induced maximal hyperemia, the microvascular resistance is minimized and relatively constant across conditions that differ only by the presence or absence of an epicardial stenosis.\n- Right atrial pressure is low under these conditions and can be treated as negligible compared with arterial pressure when relating pressure to flow.\n\nBy starting with the definition of fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the ratio of maximal achievable myocardial blood flow in the presence of a stenosis to the maximal achievable flow in the absence of that stenosis under the same hemodynamic conditions, derive an expression that relates FFR to the measured pressures and compute its value from the provided data.

It is free of ambiguity, contradictions, and subjective claims. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to derive an expression for Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) using the provided principles and then compute its value along with a severity indicator $S$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definition, FFR is the ratio of the maximal myocardial blood flow in the presence of a stenosis ($Q_{stenosis}$) to the hypothetical maximal flow in the absence of the stenosis ($Q_{normal}$).\n$$\n\\text{FFR} = \\frac{Q_{stenosis}}{Q_{normal}}\n$$\nThe flow $Q$ is modeled by the relation $Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}$, where $\\Delta P$ is the perfusion pressure across the myocardial bed and $R$ is the resistance of that bed. The perfusion pressure is the difference between the pressure entering the microcirculation and the pressure exiting it (coronary venous pressure, approximated by right atrial pressure, $P_v$).\n\nFirst, let's express the flow in the hypothetical normal case, $Q_{normal}$. In a normal coronary artery without an epicardial stenosis, the pressure driving flow through the microcirculation is the aortic pressure, $P_a$. The perfusion pressure across the myocardium is therefore $\\Delta P_{normal} = P_a - P_v$. Let $R_{micro}$ be the resistance of the microvascular bed. Under maximal hyperemia, this resistance is at its minimum and is considered constant. Thus, the maximal flow is:\n$$\nQ_{normal} = \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{micro}}\n$$\nNext, we express the flow in the presence of the stenosis, $Q_{stenosis}$. The stenosis causes a pressure drop in the epicardial artery. The pressure distal to the stenosis, $P_d$, is the pressure that drives flow through the microcirculation. The perfusion pressure across the myocardium is now $\\Delta P_{stenosis} = P_d - P_v$. The microvascular resistance $R_{micro}$ is the same as in the normal case because the measurement is performed under maximal hyperemia in both scenarios. The maximal flow in the stenosed artery is:\n$$\nQ_{stenosis} = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{micro}}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute these expressions for $Q_{normal}$ and $Q_{stenosis}$ into the definition of FFR:\n$$\n\\text{FFR} = \\frac{Q_{stenosis}}{Q_{normal}} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{P_d - P_v}{R_{micro}} \\right)}{\\left( \\frac{P_a - P_v}{R_{micro}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe term for microvascular resistance, $R_{micro}$, is common to both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial feature of FFR, as it becomes independent of microvascular resistance.\n$$\n\\text{FFR} = \\frac{P_d - P_v}{P_a - P_v}\n$$\nThe problem states that the right atrial pressure, $P_v$, can be treated as negligible. We therefore set $P_v = 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{FFR} = \\frac{P_d - 0}{P_a - 0} = \\frac{P_d}{P_a}\n$$\nThis derived expression relates FFR directly to the measured proximal ($P_a$) and distal ($P_d$) pressures.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of FFR using the given data: $P_a = 95$ mmHg and $P_d = 68$ mmHg.\n$$\n\\text{FFR} = \\frac{68}{95} \\approx 0.715789...\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{FFR} \\approx 0.716\n$$\nFinally, we determine the binary severity indicator $S$. The condition for a hemodynamically significant lesion is $\\text{FFR} \\le 0.80$. Our calculated value is $\\text{FFR} \\approx 0.716$. Since $0.716 \\le 0.80$, the lesion is considered hemodynamically significant. Therefore, the severity indicator $S$ is $1$.\n$$\nS = 1\n$$\nThe final answer is reported as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix containing the computed FFR and the value of $S$.",

Use the following fundamental base to reason to the most likely combination of electrocardiogram (ECG) features, coronary artery lesion location, and major pathologic complications.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Myocardial infarction (MI) represents acute myocardial necrosis due to prolonged ischemia, with transmural injury producing ST-segment elevation localized to the territory of the affected coronary artery.\n- The right coronary artery (RCA) typically supplies the right ventricle, the inferior wall of the left ventricle, the posterior descending artery in right-dominant circulation, and the atrioventricular (AV) node in most individuals.\n- The right ventricle is highly preload dependent; acute right ventricular infarction reduces right ventricular output and subsequently left ventricular preload, producing hypotension with relatively clear lungs due to the absence of acute left-sided congestion.\n- Injury currents manifest on the electrocardiogram (ECG) as ST-segment elevation in leads overlying the injured region, and reciprocal ST-segment depression in opposite leads. Right-sided precordial leads (e.g., $V4R$) are used to detect right ventricular involvement.\n- Inferior wall involvement classically produces ST-segment elevation in $II$, $III$, and $aVF$, and when the RCA is the culprit artery, ST-segment elevation in $III$ tends to exceed that in $II$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient presentation: acute chest pressure, hypotension, distended jugular veins, clear lung fields on auscultation, no lower-extremity edema.\n- Suspected diagnosis: acute right ventricular myocardial infarction (MI).\n- Fundamental base principles:\n    - MI is acute necrosis from ischemia; transmural injury causes localized ST-segment elevation.\n    - Right coronary artery (RCA) supplies the right ventricle (RV), inferior wall of the left ventricle (LV), posterior descending artery (PDA), and atrioventricular (AV) node.\n    - Acute RV infarction leads to reduced RV output, reduced LV preload, hypotension, and clear lungs.\n    - Injury currents cause ST-segment elevation in overlying ECG leads (e.g., $V4R$ for RV) and reciprocal ST-segment depression in opposite leads.\n    - Inferior wall MI: ST-segment elevation in leads $II$, $III$, and $aVF$. If RCA is the culprit, ST elevation in $III$ > ST elevation in $II$.\n    - AV nodal ischemia from RCA occlusion may cause bradyarrhythmias and AV block.\n    - The posteromedial papillary muscle, supplied by the PDA, is prone to rupture in inferior MI, causing acute severe mitral regurgitation.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical presentation of hypotension, distended jugular veins, and clear lung fields is the classic triad of hemodynamically significant right ventricular infarction. The provided \"Fundamental base\" accurately summarizes the relevant cardiovascular pathophysiology, anatomy, and electrocardiography, consistent with established medical principles. The problem is well-posed, asking for the integration of findings, lesion location, and complications based on the provided principles. The language is objective and clinical. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The scenario is realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by deriving the expected findings from the provided information and then evaluating each option.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\n\nThe clinical presentation unequivocally points to an acute right ventricular (RV) infarction with hemodynamic compromise.\n1.  **Pathophysiology:** The triad of hypotension, distended jugular veins (elevated central venous pressure), and clear lung fields is pathognomonic for RV failure. The infarcted RV fails to pump blood effectively to the pulmonary circulation and the left side of the heart. The backup of blood in the systemic venous circulation causes jugular venous distention. The failure to deliver blood to the left ventricle (LV) results in decreased LV preload, leading to diminished cardiac output and hypotension. Because the left side of the heart is \"underfilled,\" pulmonary venous pressure does not rise, and pulmonary edema (manifesting as crackles or \"wet\" lung fields) does not develop.\n2.  **Coronary Artery Lesion:** Based on the fundamental principles, the RV is supplied by the RCA. A severe RV infarct causing hemodynamic collapse implies an occlusion of the RCA that is proximal to the origin of the major right ventricular marginal branches. Such a proximal RCA occlusion also affects its more distal territories, including the inferior wall of the LV and, in most individuals, the AV node and the PDA.\n3.  **Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings:**\n    -   Because the inferior wall of the LV is also involved, one would expect ST-segment elevation in the inferior leads: $II$, $III$, and $aVF$.\n    -   The leads electrically opposite to the inferior wall are the high lateral leads, $I$ and $aVL$. Reciprocal ST-segment depression is expected in these leads.\n    -   Given RV infarction, ST-segment elevation should be present in right-sided precordial leads, most sensitively in lead $V4R$.\n    -   The fundamental base notes that in an RCA-culprit inferior MI, the magnitude of ST-segment elevation in lead $III$ is typically greater than that in lead $II$.\n4.  **Pathologic Complications:**\n    -   **Electrical:** Ischemia of the sinoatrial (SA) node (also often supplied by the proximal RCA) and the AV node (supplied by the RCA in most cases) can lead to bradyarrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia and varying degrees of AV block.\n    -   **Mechanical:** The posteromedial papillary muscle of the mitral valve typically has a single blood supply from the PDA. In a right-dominant circulation (where the PDA arises from the RCA), a proximal RCA occlusion can lead to infarction and subsequent rupture of this muscle. This is a life-threatening mechanical complication that usually occurs $2$–$7$ days after the initial MI, once necrosis and tissue softening (myomalacia) have occurred. Rupture leads to acute, severe mitral regurgitation.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. ST-segment elevation in $II$, $III$, and $aVF$ with reciprocal depression in $I$ and $aVL$, plus ST-segment elevation in right-sided lead $V4R$; proximal right coronary artery occlusion before right ventricular branches; complications include sinus bradycardia or AV nodal block and posteromedial papillary muscle rupture leading to acute severe mitral regurgitation at $2$–$7$ days.**\n-   **ECG:** This description is a perfect match for an acute inferior MI with RV extension. It includes an inferior injury pattern, appropriate reciprocal changes, and the specific finding for RV involvement ($V4R$ elevation).\n-   **Lesion:** \"proximal right coronary artery occlusion\" is the correct anatomical correlate for a combined inferior and RV infarction.\n-   **Complications:** The listed complications (bradycardia/AV block and delayed posteromedial papillary muscle rupture) are the classic and most significant complications associated with proximal RCA occlusion.\n-   **Verdict:** Correct. This option correctly integrates all elements of the clinical scenario.\n\n**B. ST-segment elevation in $V1$–$V4$ with new Q waves; proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion; complications include ventricular septal rupture and cardiogenic pulmonary edema.**\n-   **ECG/Lesion:** ST-segment elevation in leads $V1$–$V4$ indicates an anterior MI, caused by a left anterior descending (LAD) artery occlusion. This is inconsistent with an RV/inferior infarction.\n-   **Complications:** Cardiogenic pulmonary edema results from acute LV failure, which would cause crackles on lung auscultation, directly contradicting the \"clear lung fields\" finding.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. ST-segment elevation in $II$, $III$, and $aVF$ where elevation in $II$ exceeds that in $III$, without right-sided precordial ST elevation; left circumflex artery occlusion; complications include anterolateral papillary muscle rupture causing acute severe mitral regurgitation.**\n-   **ECG/Lesion:** ST elevation in lead $II$ greater than lead $III$ suggests a left circumflex (LCx) artery, not RCA, occlusion. The absence of right-sided ST elevation rules out the RV involvement that is central to the clinical presentation.\n-   **Complications:** The anterolateral papillary muscle has a dual blood supply and is less prone to rupture. The entire scenario points away from an LCx lesion.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. ST-segment elevation in $I$, $aVL$, and $V5$–$V6$; obtuse marginal branch occlusion; complications include progressive concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and chronic ischemic cardiomyopathy with preserved ejection fraction.**\n-   **ECG/Lesion:** This pattern indicates a high lateral MI, inconsistent with the patient's presentation.\n-   **Complications:** The listed complications are chronic, not acute. Concentric hypertrophy is related to pressure overload, not ischemia. Ischemic cardiomyopathy typically features a *reduced* ejection fraction.\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. ST-segment depression in $V1$–$V3$ with ST-segment elevation in posterior leads $V7$–$V9$; distal right coronary artery occlusion beyond right ventricular branches; complications include severe left-sided pulmonary edema with crackles at presentation.**\n-   **ECG/Lesion:** This ECG describes a posterior MI. However, a \"distal\" RCA occlusion, occurring after the RV branches, would not cause the profound RV failure syndrome seen in the patient.\n-   **Complications:** The presence of \"severe left-sided pulmonary edema\" directly contradicts the key finding of \"clear lung fields.\"\n-   **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
