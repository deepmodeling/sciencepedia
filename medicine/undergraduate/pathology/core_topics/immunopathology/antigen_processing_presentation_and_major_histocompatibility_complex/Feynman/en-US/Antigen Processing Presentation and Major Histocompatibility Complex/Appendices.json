This hands-on practice delves into the intricate biochemical conditions required for this process, using a hypothetical scenario where a pathogen disrupts the acidic environment of the endosome. By analyzing how $pH$ changes affect the activities of critical enzymes like cathepsins and the peptide editor HLA-DM, you will learn to predict the net outcome on the diversity of peptides presented to CD$4^+$ T cells .",

            "problem": "A researcher investigates how a pathogen that secretes weak bases alters antigen presentation on Major Histocompatibility Complex class II (MHC II). Under physiological conditions, late endosomes and lysosomes in antigen-presenting cells maintain an acidic environment with $pH \\approx 4.5$ to $pH \\approx 5.5$ via the vacuolar-type adenosine triphosphatase (V-ATPase). In this compartment, exogenous proteins are processed by endosomal/lysosomal proteases (for example, cathepsins) into peptides, which are loaded onto MHC II molecules after Class II-associated invariant chain peptide (CLIP) removal catalyzed by Human Leukocyte Antigen-DM (HLA-DM). The pathogen raises the endosomal $pH$ to $pH \\approx 6.5$–$pH \\approx 7.0$.\n\nThe following well-established, qualitative dependencies are considered as the fundamental base of your reasoning:\n- Acid-dependent cathepsins such as cathepsin $L$ and cathepsin $B$ show sharply reduced activity as $pH$ increases above mildly acidic values; cathepsin $S$ is more tolerant of increased $pH$ and retains appreciable activity closer to neutral.\n- HLA-DM facilitates CLIP release and peptide exchange most efficiently at mildly acidic $pH$; its catalytic efficiency declines as $pH$ approaches neutrality.\n\nLet $A_i(pH)$ denote the qualitative activity curve of cathepsin $i$ as a function of $pH$, and let $E_{\\mathrm{DM}}(pH)$ denote the qualitative catalytic efficiency profile of HLA-DM. Assume that effective peptide repertoire diversity on MHC II depends on both the generation of peptides by proteolysis and the selection/editing by HLA-DM, such that diversity increases when both proteolysis and editing are within their effective ranges, and decreases when either is compromised.\n\nWhich option best predicts the net effect of pathogen-induced endosomal alkalinization on the diversity and characteristics of the MHC II peptide repertoire?\n\nA. Repertoire diversity decreases, with a shift toward peptides generated by cathepsin $S$, longer termini due to reduced trimming, and increased CLIP retention because HLA-DM editing is impaired at higher $pH$.\n\nB. Repertoire diversity increases, because reduced proteolysis prevents over-digestion, and HLA-DM editing is enhanced at higher $pH$, favoring more unique high-affinity peptides.\n\nC. No major change in repertoire diversity, because cathepsin $S$ completely compensates for the loss of other cathepsins and HLA-DM is $pH$-independent.\n\nD. Repertoire diversity decreases, but with a shift toward shorter peptides due to accelerated proteolysis by cathepsin $L$ and $B$ at higher $pH$ and enhanced HLA-DM editing.\n\nE. Repertoire diversity increases specifically for membrane-derived peptides processed via autophagy, because alkalinization selectively boosts autophagic flux and HLA-DM editing at higher $pH$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to predict the net effect of pathogen-induced endosomal alkalinization (raising pH from ~5.0 to ~7.0) on the MHC class II peptide repertoire. This requires analyzing the impact of pH on two key processes: proteolysis and peptide editing.\n\n1.  **Impact on Proteolysis**: The problem states that acid-dependent cathepsins (like L and B) show sharply reduced activity as pH increases towards neutral. Cathepsin S is more tolerant but not immune to this change. Therefore, the overall efficiency of breaking down exogenous proteins into peptides will decrease. This will alter the pool of available peptides, likely leading to incomplete digestion and a skew towards peptides that can be produced by the more pH-tolerant enzymes like cathepsin S.\n\n2.  **Impact on Peptide Editing**: The problem states that HLA-DM, the catalyst for exchanging CLIP with antigenic peptides, is most efficient at mildly acidic pH and its efficiency declines as pH approaches neutrality. Therefore, endosomal alkalinization will impair HLA-DM function. This impairment has two major consequences: (a) MHC II molecules will have a harder time releasing the CLIP placeholder peptide, leading to increased CLIP retention. (b) The \"editing\" function, which ensures high-affinity peptides are selected, will be compromised, reducing the quality of the presented repertoire.\n\n3.  **Net Effect**: The combination of compromised peptide generation and impaired peptide editing will lead to a significant decrease in the overall diversity and quality of the peptide repertoire presented by MHC II molecules. The resulting repertoire will be characterized by:\n    *   A higher proportion of MHC II molecules bound to CLIP.\n    *   A peptide pool skewed towards fragments generated by the more pH-tolerant cathepsin S.\n    *   Potentially longer, incompletely trimmed peptides due to reduced overall proteolytic activity.\n\nThis reasoning directly aligns with option A, which describes a decrease in repertoire diversity, a shift toward cathepsin S-generated peptides, longer termini, and increased CLIP retention due to impaired HLA-DM editing.",

This practice provides a quantitative lens to understand this competition, which underlies the phenomenon of immunodominance.

Three distinct 9-mer peptides, labeled peptide $P_1$, peptide $P_2$, and peptide $P_3$, compete for binding to the same peptide-binding groove on HLA-B*08:01. The binding interaction for each peptide is assumed to follow reversible bimolecular mass-action kinetics $R + L_i \\rightleftharpoons RL_i$, where $R$ is the free HLA-B*08:01, $L_i$ is peptide $P_i$, and $RL_i$ is the peptide–MHC complex. The equilibrium dissociation constants are experimentally measured as $K_{d,1} = 3\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ for $P_1$, $K_{d,2} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ for $P_2$, and $K_{d,3} = 300\\ \\mathrm{nM}$ for $P_3$.

Express the final fractional occupancy as a unitless decimal, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem describes a scenario of competitive binding of three distinct peptides, $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$, to the same peptide-binding groove of the HLA-B*08:01 molecule. The system is at steady state, and the interactions are governed by reversible bimolecular mass-action kinetics.\n\nThe binding reaction for each peptide $L_i$ (where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$) with the receptor $R$ (HLA-B*08:01) is given by:\n$$R + L_i \\rightleftharpoons RL_i$$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{d,i}$, is defined for each reaction as the ratio of the product of the concentrations of the reactants to the concentration of the product at equilibrium:\n$$K_{d,i} = \\frac{[R][L_i]}{[RL_i]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free HLA-B*08:01, $[L_i]$ is the concentration of free peptide $P_i$, and $[RL_i]$ is the concentration of the peptide–MHC complex.\n\nWe can rearrange this definition to express the concentration of each complex, $[RL_i]$, as a function of the free receptor concentration, free peptide concentration, and the dissociation constant:\n$$[RL_i] = \\frac{[R][L_i]}{K_{d,i}}$$\n\nThe problem states two crucial assumptions. First, the steady-state free concentrations of the three peptides are equal. Let us denote this common concentration by $C$:\n$$[L_1] = [L_2] = [L_3] = C$$\nThe second assumption is that the peptide concentrations are large compared to the total HLA-B*08:01 concentration, which justifies treating $C$ as a constant that is not depleted by binding.\n\nSubstituting the common peptide concentration $C$ into the expressions for the complex concentrations, we get:\n$$[RL_1] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,1}}$$\n$$[RL_2] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,2}}$$\n$$[RL_3] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,3}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the relative fractional occupancy of each peptide, conditioned on the molecule being occupied by one of these three peptides. This means we are interested in the fraction of a specific complex, $[RL_i]$, relative to the total concentration of all three complexes. The total concentration of occupied HLA-B*08:01 molecules is the sum of the concentrations of the individual complexes:\n$$[RL]_{\\text{total}} = [RL_1] + [RL_2] + [RL_3]$$\n\nThe fractional occupancy for peptide $P_i$, denoted as $f_i$, is therefore:\n$$f_i = \\frac{[RL_i]}{[RL]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL_i]}{[RL_1] + [RL_2] + [RL_3]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions derived earlier for each $[RL_i]$:\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,i}}}{\\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,1}} + \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,2}} + \\frac{[R]C}{K_{d,3}}}$$\n\nThe term $[R]C$ is a common factor in both the numerator and the denominator, and thus it cancels out. This demonstrates that the relative occupancies depend only on the respective dissociation constants, not on the exact concentrations of the receptor or the peptides (as long as the peptide concentrations are equal).\n$$f_i = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{d,i}}}{\\frac{1}{K_{d,1}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,2}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,3}}}$$\n\nThe peptide that \"dominates presentation\" is the one with the highest fractional occupancy. From the formula for $f_i$, it is evident that the fractional occupancy is inversely proportional to the dissociation constant, $K_{d,i}$. A lower $K_d$ signifies a higher binding affinity and, under these competitive conditions, a higher occupancy.\n\nThe given dissociation constants are:\n$K_{d,1} = 3 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,2} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d,3} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSince $K_{d,1} < K_{d,2} < K_{d,3}$, peptide $P_1$ has the highest binding affinity and will be the dominant peptide. We are asked to compute its fractional occupancy, $f_1$.\n\nUsing the formula for $f_1$:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{K_{d,1}}}{\\frac{1}{K_{d,1}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,2}} + \\frac{1}{K_{d,3}}}$$\n\nWe substitute the numerical values for the dissociation constants. The units (nM) are consistent and will cancel out, so we can use the numerical values directly:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{300}}$$\n\nTo simplify the denominator, we find a common denominator, which is $300$:\n$$\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{30} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{100}{300} + \\frac{10}{300} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{100 + 10 + 1}{300} = \\frac{111}{300}$$\n\nNow we can compute $f_1$:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{\\frac{1}{3}}{\\frac{111}{300}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{300}{111} = \\frac{100}{111}$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as required:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{100}{111} \\approx 0.9009009...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$f_1 \\approx 0.9009$$\nThis is the fractional occupancy of the dominant peptide, $P_1$.",

            "introduction": "While the MHC class I pathway typically presents peptides from the cell's cytosol, the system has evolved alternative routes for sourcing antigens. This exercise explores what happens when the primary supply line—the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP)—is blocked. By working through this thought experiment, you will investigate a TAP-independent presentation pathway that relies on signal peptides within the endoplasmic reticulum, predicting how this shift alters the biochemical characteristics of the presented peptide repertoire . This highlights the robustness and adaptability of the antigen presentation machinery.",

            "problem": "An investigator treats cultured human cells with a small molecule inhibitor that specifically blocks the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP), thereby preventing translocation of cytosolic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The investigator wants to predict how this intervention alters the peptide length distribution and sequence composition in the ER available for loading onto Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC I), and whether any compensatory loading occurs from the secretory pathway.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases and definitions to reason your way to the prediction:\n\n- MHC I binds peptides with free amino and carboxyl termini, typically of length $8$–$10$ amino acids, stabilized by allele-specific anchor residues.\n- TAP translocates cytosolic peptides into the ER with an ATP-dependent mechanism and has a preference for peptides within roughly $8$–$16$ amino acids. In the ER, Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase $1$ (ERAP1) and Endoplasmic Reticulum Aminopeptidase $2$ (ERAP2) further trim peptides to suitable lengths for MHC I binding.\n- In the absence of TAP, the ER peptide pool is determined by ER-lumen sources, including fragments derived from signal peptides of secretory and membrane proteins. Signal peptides have a tripartite organization: an N-terminal region enriched in positive charges (n-region), a central hydrophobic region (h-region) rich in leucine/isoleucine/valine, and a C-terminal region (c-region) near the signal peptidase cleavage site. After cleavage by signal peptidase, signal peptide remnants are further processed by signal peptide peptidase, generating ER-lumen peptide fragments.\n- Let $f_c(l)$ denote the pre-trimming length distribution of cytosolic peptides entering the ER via TAP, and $f_s(l)$ denote the pre-trimming length distribution of ER-lumen signal-sequence-derived peptides. Let $T(l \\to l')$ denote the effective trimming kernel in the ER due to ERAP enzymes that maps input length $l$ to output length $l'$. The observed post-trimming length distribution is $p(l') = \\alpha \\int f_c(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl + (1-\\alpha) \\int f_s(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl$, where $\\alpha$ is the fraction of the ER peptide supply contributed by TAP-dependent cytosolic peptides. Under TAP blockade, $\\alpha \\to 0$.\n- Let $H$ be a hydrophobicity index for peptide sequences, with expected values $E[H \\mid \\text{cytosolic}] = \\mu_c$ and $E[H \\mid \\text{signal}] = \\mu_s$, where empirical observations in immunology support $\\mu_s > \\mu_c$ because signal sequences are enriched in hydrophobic residues in the h-region.\n\nWhich statement best predicts the consequences of TAP blockade for peptide length and sequence distribution in the ER and the compensatory source of peptides loaded onto MHC I?\n\nA. Blocking TAP eliminates cytosolic peptide influx ($\\alpha \\to 0$), shifting the ER peptide pool toward signal-sequence-derived fragments with higher expected hydrophobicity $E[H]$ and composition enriched in leucine/isoleucine/valine. Despite the reduced total peptide abundance, ER aminopeptidases maintain a post-trimming length distribution centered near $8$–$10$ amino acids, enabling TAP-independent loading of signal sequence peptides onto MHC I, albeit with decreased overall surface expression.\n\nB. Blocking TAP causes the MHC I binding groove to expand and preferentially accommodate peptides of length $15$–$25$ amino acids without trimming, while signal peptides cannot contribute because they are cleaved in the cytosol and do not enter the ER lumen.\n\nC. Blocking TAP does not substantially alter the ER peptide sequence distribution because proteasome-derived cytosolic peptides passively diffuse into the ER, keeping MHC I loading unchanged.\n\nD. Blocking TAP increases the fraction of acidic peptides in the ER because signal peptides are enriched in acidic residues; moreover, ER aminopeptidase activity is dependent on TAP and is therefore inhibited, shifting the length distribution toward $4$–$6$ amino acids.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to predict the consequences of blocking TAP. The provided model for the post-trimming peptide length distribution in the ER is:\n$$p(l') = \\alpha \\int f_c(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl + (1-\\alpha) \\int f_s(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl$$\nHere, the first term represents the contribution from the TAP-dependent cytosolic pathway, and the second term represents the contribution from the TAP-independent signal sequence pathway.\n\n1.  **Effect of TAP Blockade**: The problem states that the inhibitor blocks TAP, which corresponds to the parameter $\\alpha$ approaching zero ($\\alpha \\to 0$). Substituting $\\alpha = 0$ into the equation yields:\n    $$p(l') = (1-0) \\int f_s(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl = \\int f_s(l) T(l \\to l') \\, dl$$\n    This demonstrates that upon TAP blockade, the peptide pool available in the ER for MHC I loading is derived exclusively from the signal-sequence source, described by the distribution $f_s(l)$. The cytosolic peptide source is completely eliminated.\n\n2.  **Sequence Composition of the New Peptide Pool**: The problem provides information about the composition of the two peptide sources. The cytosolic peptide pool has an expected hydrophobicity of $\\mu_c$, while the signal-sequence-derived pool has an expected hydrophobicity of $\\mu_s$. It is given that $\\mu_s > \\mu_c$. Furthermore, signal peptides are described as being rich in hydrophobic residues like leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Therefore, by shifting the source of peptides entirely to signal sequences, the average hydrophobicity of the ER peptide pool will increase, and its amino acid composition will become enriched in these specific hydrophobic residues.\n\n3.  **Peptide Length Distribution**: The final length of peptides loaded onto MHC I is determined by two main factors: the trimming activity of ERAP enzymes (represented by the kernel $T(l \\to l')$) and the binding specificity of the MHC I molecule itself. The problem states that ERAP1 and ERAP2 \"trim peptides to suitable lengths for MHC I binding\" and that MHC I binds peptides \"typically of length $8$–$10$ amino acids\". This implies a strong selection pressure for this specific length range. Even though the initial fragments from signal peptides ($f_s(l)$) may have a different length distribution than cytosolic ones, the ERAP trimming machinery is still functional (the problem gives no reason to assume otherwise) and will process these peptides. The final, successfully loaded peptides will be those that have been trimmed to the optimal $8$–$10$ amino acid length required for stable binding to MHC I. Therefore, the distribution of *loaded* peptides will remain centered around this range.\n\n4.  **Overall MHC I Expression**: The TAP-dependent pathway is the primary, high-flux pathway for supplying peptides to MHC I in most cells. The signal-sequence-derived pathway is a secondary, or compensatory, pathway. Blocking the main pathway will lead to a significant reduction in the total number of available peptides in the ER. A lower concentration of suitable peptides results in less efficient loading of newly synthesized MHC I molecules. Unloaded or improperly loaded MHC I heavy chains are unstable and are targeted for degradation via the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Consequently, fewer stable MHC I-peptide complexes will transit to the cell surface, leading to a decrease in overall surface expression of MHC I.\n\nThis comprehensive analysis leads to the conclusion that option A is the correct prediction. It correctly identifies the shift in peptide source, the change in sequence composition, the role of ERAPs in maintaining peptide length, and the decrease in overall surface expression.",
