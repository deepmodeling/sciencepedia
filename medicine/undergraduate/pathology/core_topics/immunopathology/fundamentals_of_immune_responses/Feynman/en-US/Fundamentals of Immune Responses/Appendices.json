            "introduction": "The development of T cells in the thymus is a rigorous \"training\" process involving sequential quality-control checks. To become a functional, mature T cell, a developing thymocyte must pass both positive selection (recognizing self-MHC) and negative selection (not reacting too strongly to self-antigens). This exercise uses the fundamental rules of probability to model this biological filter and quantify the tiny fraction of thymocytes that successfully graduate, providing a clear example of how to calculate the efficiency of a multistep biological pathway.

            "problem": "A thymocyte undergoing development in the thymus passes through two sequential selection filters that ensure Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) restriction and self-tolerance. In the first filter, termed positive selection, thymocytes with T Cell Receptors (TCR) that bind self-MHC with appropriate affinity are retained; thymocytes that fail to bind die by neglect. In the second filter, termed negative selection, thymocytes that bind self-peptide–MHC too strongly are eliminated to enforce central tolerance.\n\nAssume a large cohort of thymocytes such that individual outcomes can be treated probabilistically. Let the probability that a randomly chosen thymocyte is positively selected be $p_{+}$, and let the probability that a positively selected thymocyte is eliminated by negative selection be $p_{-}$. The survival probability through negative selection, conditional on having been positively selected, is then $1 - p_{-}$. Assume that selection events are applied in sequence as described and that no other fate-altering processes occur.\n\nGiven $p_{+} = 0.05$ and $p_{-} = 0.60$, derive, from the basic rules of probability for sequential filters, an expression for the overall survival probability of a thymocyte that exits the thymus as a mature T cell. Then compute the corresponding fraction of the starting thymocyte cohort that exits as mature T cells. Express your final answer as a single decimal number with no units, and do not perform any rounding beyond what is implied by the given values.",
            "solution": "The problem is an application of conditional probability to a simplified, yet conceptually accurate, model of T cell development in the thymus. The process described—sequential positive and negative selection—is a fundamental concept in immunology. The given probabilities, $p_{+}$ and $p_{-}$, are well-defined, and the task is to calculate a resultant probability, making the problem self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All required data are provided, and there are no contradictions.\n\nLet us define the events for a randomly chosen thymocyte:\n- Let $S_{+}$ be the event that the thymocyte survives positive selection.\n- Let $S_{N}$ be the event that the thymocyte survives negative selection.\n\nThe problem asks for the overall survival probability, which is the probability that a thymocyte survives both positive selection and the subsequent negative selection. This corresponds to the joint probability of events $S_{+}$ and $S_{N}$ occurring, which is denoted as $P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N})$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability that a thymocyte is positively selected is given as $p_{+}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$P(S_{+}) = p_{+}$$\n\nNext, the problem states that $p_{-}$ is the probability that a *positively selected* thymocyte is *eliminated* by negative selection. This is a conditional probability. Let $E_{N}$ be the event of elimination by negative selection. Then, the probability of elimination by negative selection, given that the thymocyte has survived positive selection, is:\n$$P(E_{N} | S_{+}) = p_{-}$$\n\nThe event of surviving negative selection, $S_{N}$, is the complement of the event of being eliminated by negative selection, $E_{N}$. Thus, the probability of surviving negative selection, conditional on having survived positive selection, is:\n$$P(S_{N} | S_{+}) = 1 - P(E_{N} | S_{+})$$\nSubstituting the given variable, we get:\n$$P(S_{N} | S_{+}) = 1 - p_{-}$$\n\nThe selection events occur in sequence. A thymocyte must first pass positive selection and then pass negative selection. The overall survival probability, $P_{survival}$, is the probability of the intersection of these two events, $P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N})$. Using the definition of conditional probability, we can express this joint probability as:\n$$P_{survival} = P(S_{+} \\cap S_{N}) = P(S_{N} | S_{+}) \\times P(S_{+})$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the probabilities on the right-hand side, we derive the general expression for the overall survival probability:\n$$P_{survival} = p_{+} \\times (1 - p_{-})$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value using the given data: $p_{+} = 0.05$ and $p_{-} = 0.60$.\n$$P_{survival} = 0.05 \\times (1 - 0.60)$$\n$$P_{survival} = 0.05 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P_{survival} = 0.02$$\n\nThis calculated probability, $0.02$, represents the fraction of the starting thymocyte cohort that successfully completes both selection processes and exits the thymus as mature T cells.",

By working through this problem, you will see how receptor-mediated processes become saturated at high ligand concentrations, a fundamental concept in both immunology and biochemistry. ",

Opsonins such as complement component 3b (C3b) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) enhance phagocytosis by promoting receptor-mediated binding. From first principles, receptor-mediated uptake is saturable because the number of surface receptors is finite and ligand binding is reversible; under the quasi-steady-state approximation, such saturable processes are well described by a Michaelis–Menten-type relation, where the uptake rate $v$ increases with opsonin density $C$ but approaches a maximum as receptors become occupied.\n\nAssume the phagocytosis rate follows the saturable uptake model\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} C}{K_{m} + C},$$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum uptake rate and $K_{m}$ is the opsonin density at which the rate is half maximal.

Alternatively, and perhaps more directly, we can calculate $v(C_1)$ and $v(C_2)$ separately and then find their difference.\n\nLet's calculate the initial rate, $v_1 = v(C_1)$, where $C_1 = 25$:\n$$ v_1 = v(25) = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot 25}{K_{m} + 25} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 25}{50 + 25} = \\frac{2500}{75} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $25$:\n$$ v_1 = \\frac{2500 \\div 25}{75 \\div 25} = \\frac{100}{3} $$\nNext, let's calculate the final rate, $v_2 = v(C_2)$, where $C_2 = 50$. Notice that $C_2 = K_m$. By definition of $K_m$, the rate at this concentration should be half of the maximum rate, $V_{\\max}/2$.
