Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a broad-based dural attachment with a so-called dural tail. Hematoxylin and eosin sections show a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of polygonal to spindle cells arranged in whorled nests with occasional psammoma bodies. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates the following profile: epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) positive, somatostatin receptor 2A (SSTR2A) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) positive, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) negative (no nuclear staining), cytokeratin negative, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) negative, and CD34 variably positive in a patchy, focal pattern. \n\nUsing the foundational principles that immunohistochemistry detects lineage-defining proteins by antigen–antibody binding and that tumor location and growth pattern reflect cell of origin, select the most likely diagnosis from the options below.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a coherent and scientifically sound clinical vignette, including patient demographics, radiological findings, histological morphology, and a comprehensive immunohistochemical panel. The data are internally consistent and represent a classic case scenario in neuropathology, allowing for a rigorous differential diagnosis. The problem is well-posed, objective, and free from any of the specified flaws.\n\nThe core of the problem is to integrate multiple sources of data—clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical—to arrive at the most probable diagnosis for a dural-based intracranial mass. The provided information points to a systematic process of elimination based on cell lineage markers and defining molecular pathology.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-immunohistochemical data. The patient is a 58-year-old woman. The mass is dural-based and extra-axial, with a \"dural tail\" sign on MRI. Histology shows a well-circumscribed tumor with cells in whorled nests and psammoma bodies. These features collectively are strongly suggestive of a meningioma, and the whorled nests of polygonal cells specifically point to the meningothelial subtype. However, a definitive diagnosis requires ruling out mimics, which is the purpose of the immunohistochemical panel.\n\nNext, we analyze the immunohistochemistry (IHC) results in the context of the main differential diagnoses for a dural-based mass.\n\n1.  **Positive Markers:**\n    *   **Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) positive:** EMA is a protein typically found in various epithelial cells and is a hallmark of meningiomas, which are derived from meningothelial (arachnoidal cap) cells. Its presence is highly characteristic of meningioma, being positive in over 90% of cases.\n    *   **Somatostatin Receptor 2A (SSTR2A) positive:** SSTR2A is expressed at very high levels in nearly all meningiomas, regardless of subtype or grade. It is an exceptionally sensitive and specific marker. Its positivity provides very strong evidence for a meningioma.\n    *   **Progesterone Receptor (PR) positive:** PR expression is common in meningiomas, particularly in female patients and lower-grade tumors. This finding is entirely consistent with a meningioma in a 58-year-old woman.\n\n2.  **Negative and Variable Markers (Crucial for Differential Diagnosis):**\n    *   **Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 6 (STAT6) negative (no nuclear staining):** This is a critical result. The defining molecular event in solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma (SFT/HPC) is a *NAB2-STAT6* gene fusion, which results in the aberrant nuclear accumulation of STAT6 protein. Nuclear positivity for STAT6 is therefore a pathognomonic IHC stain for SFT/HPC. The explicit statement of \"no nuclear staining\" effectively rules out this important differential diagnosis.\n    *   **Cytokeratin negative:** Cytokeratins are intermediate filaments characteristic of epithelial cells. A positive result would strongly suggest a metastatic carcinoma. Its absence is a powerful piece of evidence against a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma to the dura.\n    *   **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) negative:** GFAP is the principal intermediate filament protein in glial cells such as astrocytes. An intra-axial glial tumor (e.g., glioblastoma) can sometimes invade the dura and mimic a primary dural mass. A negative GFAP stain excludes a glial origin for the tumor.\n    *   **CD34 variably positive in a patchy, focal pattern:** CD34 is a cell surface glycoprotein. SFT/HPC is typically characterized by strong, diffuse positivity for CD34. While some meningiomas can show focal or weak CD34 staining, the \"patchy, focal pattern\" described here, in combination with the negative STAT6 result, is not supportive of SFT/HPC and is acceptable for a meningioma.\n\n**Conclusion from Integrated Data:**\nThe combination of clinical presentation, classic radiological and histological findings, and a confirmatory IHC panel (EMA+, SSTR2A+, PR+, STAT6-, Cytokeratin-, GFAP-) provides overwhelming evidence for a meningioma. The negative stains systematically exclude the most significant mimics.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis:**\n\n- **A. Meningioma (meningothelial type):** All findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The histology (whorled nests of polygonal cells) points to the meningothelial subtype. The IHC profile is classic: positive for meningothelial markers (EMA, SSTR2A) and PR, and negative for markers of its key mimics (STAT6 for SFT/HPC, Cytokeratin for carcinoma, GFAP for glioma). This is the most likely diagnosis.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. Solitary fibrous tumor/hemangiopericytoma of the meninges:** This diagnosis is definitively excluded by the negative nuclear staining for STAT6. Nuclear STAT6 expression is the sine qua non of SFT/HPC. Furthermore, the histology of SFT/HPC (patternless architecture, staghorn vessels) does not match the described whorls and psammoma bodies.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Metastatic carcinoma to the dura (for example, breast primary):** This diagnosis is excluded by the negative cytokeratin stain. Carcinomas are, by definition, tumors of epithelial origin and express cytokeratins. While a breast primary could be PR positive, the lack of cytokeratin expression is decisive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Schwannoma:** Schwannomas are S100 protein positive and typically EMA negative. The given IHC profile (EMA positive) and histology (whorls, psammoma bodies vs. Antoni A/B patterns with Verocay bodies) are inconsistent with a schwannoma.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. Diffuse astrocytoma or glioblastoma with dural involvement:** These are glial tumors and are defined by the expression of GFAP. The negative GFAP stain conclusively rules out this possibility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The provided information consists of standard histopathological features used for the diagnosis and grading of meningiomas.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based entirely on the WHO Classification of Tumours of the Central Nervous System, which is the international standard for diagnosing and grading brain tumors. The features described—mitotic rate, brain invasion, necrosis, and specific cytological patterns—are the precise criteria used in this classification system. The values are realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of defined findings and asks for a conclusion (the grade) to be drawn based on a specified, formal system (the WHO classification). A unique and correct answer can be determined from the given information.\n-   **Objective:** The description of findings is objective and quantitative (e.g., \"6 mitoses per 10 HPF\") or based on established, defined morphological changes (e.g., \"infiltrating adjacent brain parenchyma\").\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides sufficient information to apply the WHO grading criteria. There are no internal contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-defined diagnostic challenge grounded in established medical science. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of the Correct Grade based on WHO Criteria**\n\nThe grading of meningiomas is based on specific histological criteria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The most recent edition (5th edition, 2021) firmly establishes these criteria. Let us analyze the provided findings against the definitions for each grade.\n\n1.  **WHO Grade 1 (Benign) Meningioma:** These tumors lack the features of higher-grade meningiomas. Specifically, they typically have a mitotic index of less than 4 mitoses per 10 HPF and do not exhibit brain invasion.\n\n2.  **WHO Grade 2 (Atypical) Meningioma:** The diagnosis of WHO grade 2 is established if **at least one** of the following criteria is met:\n    *   Elevated mitotic activity, defined as 4 to 19 mitoses per 10 HPF.\n    *   Brain invasion. The presence of tumor cells transgressing the pial-glial basement membrane and infiltrating the underlying brain parenchyma, by itself, is sufficient for a grade 2 diagnosis, regardless of other features.\n    *   The presence of at least three of the following five \"atypical\" features: spontaneous necrosis, sheeting architecture, prominent nucleoli, high cellularity, or small cells with a high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio.\n\n3.  **WHO Grade 3 (Anaplastic/Malignant) Meningioma:** The diagnosis of WHO grade 3 is made if **at least one** of the following is present:\n    *   Very high mitotic activity, defined as 20 or more mitoses per 10 HPF.\n    *   Frank anaplasia, meaning cytological features resembling high-grade carcinoma, sarcoma, or melanoma.\n    *   Specific high-grade histological patterns such as rhabdoid or papillary morphology.\n\n**Application to the Present Case:**\n-   **Mitotic Activity:** The count is 6 mitoses per 10 HPF. This value falls squarely within the range of 4-19 mitoses per 10 HPF. This finding, on its own, meets a criterion for WHO grade 2.\n-   **Brain Invasion:** The problem explicitly states that there is \"a small focus of tumor cells infiltrating adjacent brain parenchyma\". Brain invasion is a standalone, definitive criterion for WHO grade 2.\n-   **WHO Grade 3 Features:** The mitotic count of 6 is below the threshold of 20. The problem explicitly rules out anaplastic cytology (\"no overt carcinoma-like or sarcomatous cytologic features\") and specific high-grade patterns (\"no rhabdoid or papillary morphology\"). Therefore, the tumor cannot be WHO grade 3.\n\n**Conclusion:** This tumor possesses two independent features, either of which is sufficient to assign a diagnosis of WHO grade 2 (atypical meningioma): (1) a mitotic index of 6 per 10 HPF and (2) the presence of brain invasion. The presence of both features reinforces this grade assignment.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. WHO grade 1 (benign meningioma)**\nThis option is incorrect. A WHO grade 1 meningioma requires a mitotic index below 4 per 10 HPF and the absence of brain invasion. The described tumor has a mitotic index of 6 per 10 HPF and shows brain invasion.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**B. WHO grade 2 (atypical meningioma)**\nThis option is correct. The tumor meets the criteria for WHO grade 2 on two separate counts: its mitotic index is 6 per 10 HPF (within the 4-19 range), and it exhibits brain invasion. The presence of either one of these features is sufficient for this grade.\n*Verdict: **Correct**.*\n\n**C. WHO grade 3 (anaplastic meningioma)**\nThis option is incorrect. The mitotic index of 6 per 10 HPF is well below the threshold of 20 per 10 HPF required for grade 3 based on mitotic activity. Furthermore, overt anaplasia and other high-grade morphologies are explicitly stated to be absent.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**D. Not gradable without a proliferation index (Ki-67) result**\nThis option is incorrect. The proliferation index Ki-67 (also known as MIB-1) is an ancillary immunohistochemical stain that correlates with grade and recurrence risk but is not a primary diagnostic or grading criterion in the WHO classification system for meningiomas. The grade is determined by the histomorphological features (mitotic count, invasion, cytology, necrosis) already provided. The provided data are sufficient for grading.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*\n\n**E. WHO grade 2 only if both increased mitotic activity and brain invasion are present together; otherwise WHO grade 1**\nThis option is incorrect. This statement misrepresents the WHO grading criteria. Both increased mitotic activity (4-19 per 10 HPF) and brain invasion are independent, standalone criteria for WHO grade 2. The presence of either one is sufficient to upgrade a meningioma from grade 1 to grade 2. It is not necessary for them to occur concurrently.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect**.*",

The question regarding adjuvant radiation therapy is a central topic in the management of these tumors.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides specific data and asks for an interpretation based on established, standardized criteria (the WHO classification). A determinable answer exists based on these principles.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in objective, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. It directs the solver to use \"foundational grading and risk principles,\" which appropriately points toward the official WHO guidelines.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n-   The problem statement is **valid**. It is a standard, clinically relevant problem in pathology that is factually sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Principle-Based Derivation**\n\nThe grading of meningiomas is governed by the criteria set forth in the WHO Classification of CNS Tumours (historically the 2016 4th edition, and currently the 2021 5th edition, which maintain consistent core criteria relevant to this problem). These criteria are used to predict the biological behavior and risk of recurrence.\n\n1.  **WHO Grade I Meningioma:** These are benign tumors with a low risk of recurrence. They lack the features of higher-grade meningiomas. Characteristically, their mitotic count is low (typically $<4$ mitoses per 10 HPF).\n\n2.  **WHO Grade II (Atypical) Meningioma:** These tumors have a higher risk of recurrence. The diagnosis of Grade II is established if **any one** of the following criteria is met:\n    *   Mitotic count of $4$ to $19$ mitoses per 10 HPF.\n    *   Brain invasion.\n    *   Presence of at least three of five specific atypical histological features (spontaneous necrosis, sheet-like growth, prominent nucleoli, high cellularity, small cells with high nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio).\n\n3.  **WHO Grade III (Anaplastic/Malignant) Meningioma:** These are malignant tumors with a high rate of recurrence and aggressive behavior. The diagnosis of Grade III requires at least one of the following:\n    *   Mitotic count of $\\ge 20$ mitoses per 10 HPF.\n    *   Frankly anaplastic cytologic features (resembling sarcoma, carcinoma, or melanoma).\n\nThe Ki-67 labeling index is a measure of the proportion of cells in the active phases of the cell cycle. While it is not a primary diagnostic criterion for assigning a WHO grade to meningiomas, it is a crucial prognostic marker. A higher Ki-67 index is strongly correlated with a shorter time to recurrence. For meningiomas, an index $<5\\%$ is typical for Grade I, while indices in the range of $5\\%-20\\%$ are common in Grade II, and often $>20\\%$ in Grade III.\n\n**Application to the Given Data:**\n-   The reported mitotic count is 5 mitoses per 10 HPF. According to the WHO criteria, a mitotic count in the range of 4-19 is, by itself, sufficient to classify a meningioma as atypical, or WHO Grade II. The given value of 5 falls squarely within this range.\n-   The Ki-67 labeling index is 12%. This value is significantly elevated above the typical range for a Grade I meningioma and is consistent with the increased proliferative potential of a Grade II tumor. It serves as an adverse prognostic factor.\n\n**Implications for Adjuvant Radiation Therapy (RT):**\n-   The management of WHO Grade II meningiomas is a subject of ongoing clinical debate, particularly regarding the use of adjuvant RT after surgical resection.\n-   **Subtotal Resection (STR):** In cases of incomplete resection, there is a strong consensus that adjuvant RT should be administered to reduce the high risk of tumor recurrence.\n-   **Gross Total Resection (GTR):** After a complete resection (e.g., Simpson Grade I or II), practice varies. Some institutions recommend immediate adjuvant RT for all Grade II meningiomas, while others prefer an initial period of observation (\"watch and wait\"), with RT reserved for cases of recurrence.\n-   Prognostic factors like a high Ki-67 index ($>10\\%$ is a commonly cited threshold in clinical studies) can be used to risk-stratify patients. For a GTR Grade II meningioma, a Ki-67 of 12% would increase the concern for future recurrence and would strongly support the *consideration* of adjuvant RT, even if it does not make it universally mandatory.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The findings meet atypical (grade II) criteria via the mitotic threshold; a Ki-67 of 12% indicates an elevated proliferative fraction that can support consideration of adjuvant radiation, particularly if resection is less than gross total, while not mandating radiation after complete resection.**\n-   **Grade Assignment:** This statement correctly identifies that a mitotic count of 5 per 10 HPF meets the threshold for atypical (Grade II) meningioma (which is 4-19 mitoses per 10 HPF).\n-   **Ki-67 and RT Interpretation:** This statement correctly characterizes Ki-67 of 12% as an elevated proliferative fraction. It accurately reflects current clinical practice: the index \"can support consideration\" of RT, especially with incomplete resection, but does not make it an absolute mandate after complete resection. This nuanced position is correct.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The findings do not meet atypical (grade II) criteria because the threshold is $\\ge 6$ mitoses per 10 HPF; Ki-67 at 12% is typical of benign tumors and does not support radiation.**\n-   **Grade Assignment:** This is factually incorrect. The WHO threshold for Grade II meningioma based on mitosis is $\\ge 4$ mitoses per 10 HPF, not $\\ge 6$. Therefore, the tumor *does* meet Grade II criteria.\n-   **Ki-67 Interpretation:** A Ki-67 index of 12% is not typical of benign (Grade I) tumors, which usually show an index of $<5\\%$. This part of the statement is also factually incorrect.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The findings meet anaplastic (grade III) criteria because Ki-67 $>10\\%$ or 5 mitoses per 10 HPF is sufficient; adjuvant radiation is therefore mandatory.**\n-   **Grade Assignment:** This is factually incorrect. The mitotic threshold for anaplastic (Grade III) meningioma is $\\ge 20$ mitoses per 10 HPF. A count of 5 is characteristic of Grade II. Furthermore, the Ki-67 index is a prognostic marker, not a primary diagnostic criterion for assigning grade.\n-   **RT Interpretation:** The conclusion that RT is mandatory is based on an incorrect grade assignment.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The findings meet atypical (grade II) criteria only if brain invasion is present; absent brain invasion, this is grade I and radiation should not be used.**\n-   **Grade Assignment:** This is factually incorrect. The WHO criteria for Grade II are disjunctive (i.e., met by *any one* of the qualifying features). A mitotic count of 4-19 per 10 HPF is an independent criterion sufficient for a Grade II diagnosis, regardless of the presence or absence of brain invasion. Since the mitotic count is 5, the tumor is Grade II.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
