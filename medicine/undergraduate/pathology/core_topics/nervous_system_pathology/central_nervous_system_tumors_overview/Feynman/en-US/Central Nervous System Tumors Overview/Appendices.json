Since the field of view can vary between microscopes, a raw count can be misleading. This practice will guide you through the essential process of normalizing a mitotic count to a standard area, a critical skill in quantitative histopathology that ensures your assessment is objective and reproducible .",

            "problem": "A neurosurgical specimen reveals an intraparenchymal tumor with perivascular pseudorosettes, consistent with ependymoma. Histological examination shows geographic necrosis and microvascular proliferation in the mitotic hotspot. A trainee counted mitoses across $10$ contiguous high-power fields (HPF) using a microscope with a circular field of view of diameter $d_{\\text{lab}} = 0.60$ millimeters. The per-field mitotic counts in the hotspot were: $2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2$. The Ki-67 proliferative index (Ki-67) measured in the hotspot is $0.18$ as a fraction.\n\nBecause HPF area varies with microscope optics, you must standardize the mitotic count to a reference HPF. Assume the reference HPF is a circular field of diameter $d_{\\text{std}} = 0.50$ millimeters. Using core geometric relations and the idea that mitotic density scales with sampled area, compute the normalized mitotic count per $10$ reference HPF. Then, using historically applied World Health Organization (WHO) descriptive criteria for ependymoma grading (operationalized for this exercise as follows: assign grade $3$ if necrosis is present and the normalized mitotic count is $\\geq 10$ per $10$ HPF; otherwise assign grade $2$), determine the grade.\n\nExpress the final normalized mitotic count as a dimensionless real number rounded to four significant figures, and express the grade as an integer ($2$ or $3$). Your final answer should contain, in order, the normalized mitotic count per $10$ reference HPF and the assigned grade. No percentage signs are allowed; report Ki-67 as given but do not include it in the final numeric output.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of histopathology, provides a complete and consistent set of data, and is well-posed, admitting a unique and meaningful solution. The task is to first normalize a mitotic count observed with a specific microscope to a standard reference area, and then to apply a given set of criteria to determine the tumor grade.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total number of mitoses observed in the laboratory setting. The per-field counts over $10$ contiguous high-power fields (HPF) are given as $2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 4, 2, 3, 2, 2$. The total observed mitotic count, $M_{\\text{obs}}$, is the sum of these individual counts:\n$$M_{\\text{obs}} = 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 28$$\n\nThe core principle of normalization is that the mitotic density, $\\rho$, defined as the number of mitoses per unit area, is constant within the sampled hotspot. This density can be calculated from the laboratory measurements. The total area sampled in the lab, $A_{\\text{total, lab}}$, is the area of a single lab HPF, $A_{\\text{lab}}$, multiplied by the number of fields, $N=10$.\nThe field of view is circular with a given diameter $d_{\\text{lab}} = 0.60$ millimeters. The area of a single lab HPF is:\n$$A_{\\text{lab}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_{\\text{lab}}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.60 \\text{ mm}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (0.30 \\text{ mm})^2$$\nThe total area sampled is $A_{\\text{total, lab}} = 10 \\times A_{\\text{lab}}$. The mitotic density is therefore:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{M_{\\text{obs}}}{A_{\\text{total, lab}}} = \\frac{28}{10 \\times A_{\\text{lab}}}$$\n\nThe objective is to find the normalized mitotic count, $M_{\\text{norm}}$, which represents the expected number of mitoses in a total area equivalent to $10$ reference HPFs. The reference HPF is a circular field with diameter $d_{\\text{std}} = 0.50$ millimeters. The area of a single reference HPF, $A_{\\text{std}}$, is:\n$$A_{\\text{std}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{d_{\\text{std}}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi \\left(\\frac{0.50 \\text{ mm}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\pi (0.25 \\text{ mm})^2$$\nThe total reference area is $A_{\\text{total, std}} = 10 \\times A_{\\text{std}}$. The normalized mitotic count is the mitotic density, $\\rho$, multiplied by this total reference area:\n$$M_{\\text{norm}} = \\rho \\times A_{\\text{total, std}} = \\left(\\frac{28}{10 \\times A_{\\text{lab}}}\\right) \\times (10 \\times A_{\\text{std}})$$\nThe factor of $10$ cancels out, simplifying the relationship to a ratio of the single-field areas:\n$$M_{\\text{norm}} = M_{\\text{obs}} \\times \\frac{A_{\\text{std}}}{A_{\\text{lab}}}$$\nSubstituting the formulas for the areas:\n$$M_{\\text{norm}} = M_{\\text{obs}} \\times \\frac{\\pi (d_{\\text{std}}/2)^2}{\\pi (d_{\\text{lab}}/2)^2} = M_{\\text{obs}} \\times \\left(\\frac{d_{\\text{std}}}{d_{\\text{lab}}}\\right)^2$$\nThis formula shows that the mitotic count scales with the square of the ratio of the diameters of the fields of view. Now, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$M_{\\text{norm}} = 28 \\times \\left(\\frac{0.50}{0.60}\\right)^2 = 28 \\times \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^2 = 28 \\times \\frac{25}{36}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$M_{\\text{norm}} = 7 \\times \\frac{25}{9} = \\frac{175}{9} \\approx 19.4444...$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the normalized mitotic count is $19.44$.\n\nThe second task is to determine the tumor grade using the operationalized criteria provided:\n1.  Assign grade $3$ if necrosis is present AND the normalized mitotic count is $\\geq 10$ per $10$ HPF.\n2.  Otherwise, assign grade $2$.\n\nWe check these conditions.\nFirst, the problem statement explicitly mentions \"geographic necrosis\". Therefore, the necrosis condition for grade $3$ is met.\nSecond, we compare the calculated normalized mitotic count to the threshold. Our calculated value is $M_{\\text{norm}} \\approx 19.44$. This value is greater than or equal to the threshold of $10$.\n$$19.44 \\geq 10$$\nSince both conditions (presence of necrosis and a normalized mitotic count of $\\geq 10$) are met, the tumor is assigned grade $3$.\n\nThe Ki-67 proliferative index of $0.18$ is noted but is not required for the specific calculations requested by the problem's grading rules. It serves as contextual information consistent with a higher-grade tumor.\n\nThe final answer comprises the normalized mitotic count per $10$ reference HPF, rounded to four significant figures, and the assigned integer grade.\nNormalized mitotic count: $19.44$.\nAssigned grade: $3$.",

Consider three mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive tumor genotypes: IDH1 R132H-mutant, IDH1 R132C-mutant, and IDH-wildtype.

Use only these data streams. The algorithm must also explicitly route out cases that are not astrocytoma, IDH-mutant (for example, oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and $\\text{1p/19q}$-codeleted, or IDH-wildtype entities), and must define histology-based grading rules.\n\nFundamental base for reasoning: adult-type diffuse gliomas are first categorized by IDH status and whole-arm $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion; oligodendroglioma requires both an IDH mutation and whole-arm $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion, whereas astrocytoma, IDH-mutant lacks whole-arm $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion.

Only proceed if truly IDH-mutant. Step $3$: Test for whole-arm $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion. If present, classify as oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and stop (not astrocytoma). If absent, classify category as astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Step $4$: Use ATRX as supportive evidence (loss favors astrocytoma); if ATRX is retained, re-verify $\\text{1p/19q}$ testing but do not require ATRX loss for the astrocytoma diagnosis. TERT promoter status does not define category in IDH-mutant tumors and does not supersede $\\text{1p/19q}$.

The principles for distinguishing IDH-mutant astrocytoma from oligodendroglioma (based on IDH and $\\text{1p/19q}$ status) and the histologic criteria for grading are factually correct. The use of IHC and sequencing for molecular marker assessment is standard practice. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the selection of a correct algorithm from a set of options, based on its consistency with given principles and its performance on provided test cases. This structure allows for a unique, determinable solution.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free from subjectivity or bias. All terms (e.g., IDH, $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion, ATRX) have clear, objective definitions in the field of pathology.\n-   **Conclusion on Flaws**: The problem does not violate any of the criteria for validity. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed. It presents a standard, albeit complex, diagnostic reasoning task from pathology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of a Correct Algorithm and Application to Test Cases\nBased on the provided fundamental principles and the available inputs, a correct diagnostic algorithm can be constructed.\n\n1.  **Initial Screen**: The process starts with a tumor that has a diffuse glioma histology. All three cases meet this criterion.\n\n2.  **Molecular Classification**:\n    a.  **IDH Status**: This is the first major branch point. The most common mutation, $\\text{IDH1 R132H}$, is detectable by a specific antibody (IHC). However, other mutations in $\\text{IDH1}$ and $\\text{IDH2}$ (non-canonical mutations) exist, which are not detected by this IHC. Therefore, a negative IHC result is not conclusive. If clinical and histologic suspicion for an IDH-mutant glioma remains (e.g., diffuse astrocytoma in an adult under $55$), sequencing of $\\text{IDH1}$ and $\\text{IDH2}$ genes is mandatory to definitively establish IDH status. A tumor is classified as \"IDH-mutant\" if IHC is positive or sequencing detects a pathogenic mutation.\n    b.  **$\\text{1p/19q}$ Status**: This is the second major branch point for IDH-mutant tumors.\n        -   If IDH is mutant AND $\\text{1p/19q}$ is codeleted: The diagnosis is Oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and $\\text{1p/19q}$-codeleted. The algorithm for astrocytoma terminates here.\n        -   If IDH is mutant AND $\\text{1p/19q}$ is non-codeleted (intact): The diagnosis is Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant.\n\n3.  **Role of Ancillary Markers**:\n    -   **ATRX Status**: Loss of ATRX protein expression is strongly correlated with IDH-mutant astrocytomas and is nearly mutually exclusive with $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion. It serves as powerful supportive evidence for an astrocytoma diagnosis but is not, by itself, a defining criterion.\n    -   **TERT Promoter Status**: TERT promoter mutations are characteristic of oligodendrogliomas (along with IDH mutation and $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion) and IDH-wildtype glioblastomas. They are uncommon in IDH-mutant astrocytomas. This marker does not define the tumor type in the context of IDH-mutant gliomas; $\\text{1p/19q}$ status is paramount.\n\n4.  **Grading of Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant**: Based on the given inputs and fundamental reasoning, grading depends on histology:\n    -   **CNS WHO Grade $2$**: Absence of high-grade features (no significant mitotic activity, no microvascular proliferation, and no necrosis).\n    -   **CNS WHO Grade $3$**: Presence of significant mitotic activity (\"brisk mitoses\").\n    -   **CNS WHO Grade $4$**: Presence of microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis. (Note: The 2021 WHO classification also includes homozygous deletion of $\\text{CDKN2A/B}$ as a molecular criterion for Grade $4$, but this marker is not among the provided inputs, so grading must be based solely on histology as per the problem constraints).\n\n### Application to Test Cases:\n-   **Case A**: IDH positive IHC ($\\text{IDH1 R132H}$) → IDH-mutant. $\\text{1p/19q}$ non-codeleted. Diagnosis is Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Histology shows no high-grade features. **Result: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade $2$**.\n-   **Case B**: IDH negative IHC, but sequencing shows $\\text{IDH2 R172K}$ mutation → IDH-mutant. $\\text{1p/19q}$ non-codeleted. Diagnosis is Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Histology shows brisk mitotic activity. **Result: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade $3$**.\n-   **Case C**: IDH positive IHC ($\\text{IDH1 R132H}$) → IDH-mutant. $\\text{1p/19q}$ non-codeleted. Diagnosis is Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Histology shows necrosis. **Result: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, CNS WHO grade $4$**.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Step $1$: Confirm a diffuse glioma histology. Step $2$: Determine IDH status. If IHC is positive for $\\text{IDH1 R132H}$ or sequencing reveals a pathogenic $\\text{IDH1/IDH2}$ variant, proceed as IDH-mutant; if IHC is negative but clinical/pathologic context suggests a diffuse glioma in a younger patient, reflex to sequencing before concluding IDH-wildtype. Only proceed if truly IDH-mutant. Step $3$: Test for whole-arm $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion. If present, classify as oligodendroglioma, IDH-mutant and stop (not astrocytoma). If absent, classify category as astrocytoma, IDH-mutant. Step $4$: Use ATRX as supportive evidence (loss favors astrocytoma); if ATRX is retained, re-verify $\\text{1p/19q}$ testing but do not require ATRX loss for the astrocytoma diagnosis. TERT promoter status does not define category in IDH-mutant tumors and does not supersede $\\text{1p/19q}$. Step $5$ (grading): Grade $2$ if no brisk mitotic activity, no microvascular proliferation, and no necrosis; grade $3$ if mitotic activity is present; grade $4$ if microvascular proliferation and/or necrosis is present. Apply to cases: A → astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $2$; B → astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $3$; C → astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $4$.**\n\n-   **Algorithm Evaluation**: This algorithm is scientifically sound. Step $2$ correctly describes the need for reflex sequencing after negative IHC. Step $3$ correctly uses the IDH/$\\text{1p/19q}$ combination to separate astrocytoma from oligodendroglioma. Step $4$ correctly assigns a supportive, non-definitional role to ATRX and TERT. Step $5$ provides a correct histology-based grading scheme consistent with the problem statement.\n-   **Case Application Evaluation**: The application of the algorithm to the cases yields:\n    -   Case A: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $2$. (Correct)\n    -   Case B: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $3$. (Correct)\n    -   Case C: Astrocytoma, IDH-mutant, grade $4$. (Correct)\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Step $1$: Require ATRX loss to enter the astrocytoma pathway; if ATRX is retained, do not diagnose astrocytoma. Step $2$: Use TERT promoter mutation to reclassify any IDH-mutant, non-codeleted tumor as oligodendroglioma. Step $3$ (grading): Use Ki-$67$ labeling index thresholds (for example, $>10\\%$ for grade $3$, $>30\\%$ or TERT promoter mutation for grade $4$) rather than histologic features. Apply to cases: A → astrocytoma, grade $2$; B → not astrocytoma if ATRX retained; C → oligodendroglioma if TERT promoter mutated.**\n\n-   **Algorithm Evaluation**: This algorithm is fundamentally flawed.\n    -   Step $1$: Making ATRX loss an absolute requirement for astrocytoma diagnosis is incorrect. The defining feature is the combination of IDH mutation and absence of $\\text{1p/19q}$ codeletion.\n    -   Step $2$: Reclassifying a tumor as oligodendroglioma based on TERT status, in defiance of $\\text{1p/19q}$ status, violates the primary diagnostic principle.\n    -   Step $3$: The grading rules are not \"histology-based\" as required by the problem statement and incorrectly use TERT status for grading.\n-   **Case Application Evaluation**: The application is incorrect. Case C would be misdiagnosed as oligodendroglioma.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Step $1$: If IDH IHC is negative, conclude IDH-wildtype without sequencing. Step $2$: If TERT promoter is mutated, classify as oligodendroglioma regardless of $\\text{1p/19q}$. Step $3$ (grading): Assign grade $4$ only if both microvascular proliferation and necrosis are present; assign grade $3$ if either is present without the other. Apply to cases: A → astrocytoma, grade $2$; B → IDH-wildtype, not astrocytoma; C → oligodendroglioma.**\n\n-   **Algorithm Evaluation**: This algorithm contains multiple errors.\n    -   Step $1$: Failing to reflex to sequencing after a negative IDH IHC is a critical error that leads to misdiagnosis, as demonstrated by Case B.\n    -   Step $2$: Same error as in Option B, incorrectly prioritizing TERT status over the defining $\\text{1p/19q}$ marker for oligodendroglioma.\n    -   Step $3$: The grading rule for grade $4$ is incorrect; either microvascular proliferation or necrosis is sufficient.\n-   **Case Application Evaluation**: The application is incorrect. Case B would be misdiagnosed as IDH-wildtype. Case C would be misdiagnosed as oligodendroglioma.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Step $1$: Confirm diffuse glioma histology. Step $2$: Determine IDH status by IHC only; if negative, do not reflex to sequencing. Step $3$: If ATRX is retained and TERT promoter is mutated, presume oligodendroglioma even if $\\text{1p/19q}$ testing is not available; perform $\\text{1p/19q}$ testing only if ATRX is lost. Step $4$ (grading): Grade $3$ requires both mitoses and microvascular proliferation; grade $4$ requires necrosis only. Apply to cases: A → astrocytoma, grade $2$; B → IDH-wildtype; C → astrocytoma, grade $4$.**\n\n-   **Algorithm Evaluation**: This algorithm is also critically flawed.\n    -   Step $2$: Same error as in Option C; failing to sequence after negative IHC is incorrect.\n    -   Step $3$: This logic is convoluted and incorrect. It inappropriately bases major diagnostic decisions on secondary markers (ATRX, TERT) and makes the primary marker ($\\text{1p/19q}$) conditional.\n    -   Step $4$: The grading rules are incorrect. Mitotic activity alone can define grade $3$. Microvascular proliferation also confers grade $4$ status, not just necrosis.\n-   **Case Application Evaluation**: The application is incorrect. Case B would be misdiagnosed as IDH-wildtype.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, only option A provides a logically and scientifically correct algorithm that is consistent with the provided principles and correctly classifies all test cases.",
