            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n-   **Patient**: A $22$-year-old.\n-   **Presentation**: Acute eruption.\n-   **Lesion Type**: Numerous round plaques.\n-   **Location**: Dorsal hands, palms, and extensor forearms.\n-   **Distribution**: Largely symmetric.\n-   **Lesion Morphology**:\n    -   Sharply demarcated.\n    -   Size: $1$–$2$ cm.\n    -   Structure: $3$ concentric zones:\n        1.  A central dusky area with thin crust.\n        2.  A surrounding pale edematous ring.\n        3.  An outer erythematous rim.\n-   **Negative Findings**: No visible sheets of epidermal detachment.\n-   **Missing Information**: Mucosal findings are not provided.\n-   **Task**: Identify the most consistent statements based on the provided description.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem must be evaluated for scientific grounding, being well-posed, and objectivity.\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in the field of dermatology. The terminology used, including *plaque*, *erythematous*, *edematous*, *epidermal detachment*, *erythema multiforme*, *Stevens-Johnson syndrome*, *toxic epidermal necrolysis*, *interface dermatitis*, and *necrotic keratinocytes*, are all standard and well-defined terms in dermatology and dermatopathology. The description of a lesion with $3$ distinct zones is the classical definition of a \"typical target lesion.\" The clinical scenario is a realistic and standard presentation for evaluation.\n\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a detailed morphological description of skin lesions and their distribution, along with a key negative finding. This information is sufficient to construct a strong differential diagnosis and evaluate the consistency of the given statements against established medical knowledge. The question is clear and answerable. The lack of mucosal findings is noted, which is a realistic constraint in a clinical vignette and directs the focus to the skin findings.\n\n3.  **Objective**: The description is objective, using precise language to describe lesion size (e.g., \"$1$–$2$ cm\"), morphology (e.g., \"sharply demarcated,\" \"$3$ concentric zones\"), and distribution. It avoids subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and free from internal contradictions or ambiguities. It represents a valid clinical reasoning problem in dermatology. Therefore, the solution process will proceed.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe clinical vignette describes a young adult with an acute, symmetric eruption of lesions on the distal extremities, including hands and palms. The morphology of the lesions is described with high precision: sharply demarcated, $1$–$2$ cm plaques with $3$ concentric zones (a dusky/crusted center, a pale edematous middle ring, and an erythematous outer rim). This is the pathognomonic definition of a **typical target lesion**. The presence of numerous typical target lesions in an acral distribution is the hallmark of **erythema multiforme (EM)**. The explicit mention of \"no visible sheets of epidermal detachment\" is a critical negative finding that helps differentiate this condition from more severe cutaneous drug reactions like Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The morphology represents typical target lesions; this pattern strongly favors erythema multiforme over Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis in the absence of widespread epidermal detachment.**\n\n-   The description of a lesion with $3$ zones (dusky center, pale ring, erythematous rim) is, by definition, a **typical target lesion**.\n-   Erythema multiforme (EM) is classically characterized by the presence of typical target lesions, often in an acral (hands, feet, elbows, knees) and symmetric distribution.\n-   Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are considered a spectrum of the same disease, primarily characterized by widespread epidermal necrosis and detachment. The lesions in SJS/TEN are typically **atypical targets** (macules with only $2$ zones, often purpuric) or diffuse erythema that rapidly progresses to bullae and epidermal sloughing.\n-   The combination of typical targets and the absence of widespread epidermal detachment are the key clinical features that distinguish EM from SJS/TEN.\n-   Therefore, this statement is a correct and precise summary of the clinical situation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. These are atypical targets; their predominance should shift the differential diagnosis toward Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.**\n\n-   This statement's premise is factually incorrect. The described lesions, with their $3$ distinct concentric zones, are the definition of **typical** targets, not atypical ones. Atypical targets are defined as having only $2$ zones or being poorly demarcated.\n-   Because the initial premise is false, the conclusion that the differential should shift toward SJS/TEN is also incorrect. The presence of typical targets, as described, actually points away from SJS/TEN and toward EM.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The described lesions are more consistent with fixed drug eruption, given their targetoid appearance and symmetry.**\n\n-   A fixed drug eruption (FDE) characteristically presents as one or a few sharply demarcated, dusky red or violaceous plaques that recur in the exact same locations upon re-exposure to a causative agent. While individual FDE lesions can be bullous or have a targetoid appearance, the presentation of numerous, symmetrically distributed lesions across the hands and forearms is not the typical pattern for FDE. The classic presentation described in the problem is far more specific for erythema multiforme.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The morphology is characteristic of Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated acute urticaria.**\n\n-   Acute urticaria presents as wheals (hives), which are transient, edematous, pruritic plaques. An individual urticarial lesion typically resolves within $24$ hours.\n-   The lesions described in the problem have a \"central dusky area with thin crust.\" A crust indicates epidermal injury and necrosis, which is not a feature of IgE-mediated urticaria. Urticaria is a dermal process involving vasodilation and edema, without significant epidermal damage. While some forms of urticaria can have a targetoid appearance (urticaria multiforme), they lack the central dusky or necrotic component.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. If biopsied, the most likely histopathology would show an interface dermatitis with necrotic keratinocytes at multiple levels of the epidermis and a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, consistent with erythema multiforme.**\n\n-   This statement provides a detailed histopathological description. The clinical picture is highly suggestive of erythema multiforme. The classic histopathology of EM is indeed an **interface dermatitis**, where inflammation is centered at the dermal-epidermal junction.\n-   Key features include vacuolar alteration of the basal cell layer, a lymphocytic infiltrate, and, most characteristically, apoptosis/necrosis of individual keratinocytes. These necrotic keratinocytes are scattered throughout the epidermis, not just in the basal layer.\n-   The inflammatory infiltrate in EM is typically a superficial, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.\n-   This entire description is a textbook account of the histopathological findings of erythema multiforme.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

The trunk is largely spared. Ten days ago he started amoxicillin for acute sinusitis. He denies fever, malaise, ocular symptoms, genital discomfort, or oral pain.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient**: A `$24$`-year-old man.\n- **Chief Complaint**: Acute pruritic eruption.\n- **History of Present Illness**: Onset on the backs of hands and feet, spreading to extensor forearms and legs over `$24$` hours. Trunk is largely spared. Started amoxicillin for acute sinusitis `$10$` days prior to onset.\n- **Review of Systems**: Denies fever, malaise, ocular symptoms, genital discomfort, or oral pain.\n- **Physical Examination**:\n    - **Lesions**: Multiple well-demarcated “target” lesions with `$3$` concentric zones of color change and a central dusky area.\n    - **Distribution**: Dorsal hands, extensor forearms, and feet.\n    - **Other findings**: No bullae, no erosions, no appreciable mucosal involvement.\n    - **Special Tests**: Lateral pressure on perilesional skin does not induce epidermal sloughing (Nikolsky sign is negative).\n- **Task**: Using core clinical definitions, classify the eruption and provide the best justification.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is a clinical vignette that requires the application of established diagnostic criteria from dermatology.\n\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is scientifically grounded. The clinical presentation, including the description of \"target\" lesions, acral distribution, drug history (amoxicillin), time latency (`$10$` days), and the negative Nikolsky sign, describes a classic scenario in dermatology. The concepts of Erythema Multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS), morbilliform eruption, and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) are well-defined medical conditions. The mechanism of the Nikolsky sign (loss of epidermal coherence) is a fundamental concept in blistering skin diseases.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. The clinical data provided are sufficient to arrive at a \"most likely\" diagnosis among the choices by systematically applying standard diagnostic criteria. The question asks for a classification and justification, for which a unique and stable answer exists based on the provided evidence.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is objective. It presents clinical findings in precise, unbiased language (e.g., \"well-demarcated\", \"$3$ concentric zones\", \"no appreciable mucosal involvement\").\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, contradiction, or ambiguity. All terms are standard in the field of dermatology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. \n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe diagnosis is established by systematically analyzing the key clinical features in the context of the differential diagnoses provided.\n\n1.  **Lesion Morphology**: The pathognomonic finding is \"multiple well-demarcated 'target' lesions with three concentric zones of color change and a central dusky area\". These are described as \"true\" or \"typical\" target lesions. This specific morphology is the hallmark of Erythema Multiforme (EM). Other conditions like SJS may have \"atypical targets\" or \"targetoid\" lesions, which are usually flat, have only `$2$` zones, and a poorly defined border. Morbilliform eruptions consist of macules and papules (\"measles-like\"), not target lesions.\n\n2.  **Lesion Distribution**: The eruption has an acral (hands and feet) and extensor (forearms and legs) distribution, with the trunk being \"largely spared\". This distribution is classic for EM. In contrast, morbilliform drug eruptions typically begin on the trunk and spread centrifugally.\n\n3.  **Mucosal Involvement**: The patient has \"no appreciable mucosal involvement\" and denies oral, ocular, or genital symptoms. EM is sub-classified based on mucosal involvement. `EM minor` is defined by the absence of or only mild involvement of one mucosal surface. `EM major` is defined by significant involvement (e.g., erosions, bullae) of at least one mucosal surface. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is characterized by severe, widespread mucosal erosions, typically affecting two or more sites (e.g., oral, ocular, genital). The complete absence of mucosal disease in this patient points strongly to `EM minor` and argues definitively against `EM major` and SJS.\n\n4.  **Systemic Symptoms**: The patient \"denies fever, malaise\". `EM minor` is typically associated with minimal to no systemic symptoms. In contrast, SJS and DRESS are severe systemic reactions characterized by high fever and profound malaise. The absence of these symptoms is another strong point against SJS and DRESS.\n\n5.  **Nikolsky Sign**: The Nikolsky sign is negative. This sign indicates a plane of cleavage within the epidermis or at the dermal-epidermal junction, where lateral pressure causes the epidermis to slough off. A positive Nikolsky sign is a characteristic and crucial finding in SJS and its more severe variant, Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN), as it reflects widespread keratinocyte apoptosis and full-thickness epidermal necrosis. Its absence argues against SJS/TEN and is consistent with EM, where the inflammatory process does not typically cause such widespread loss of epidermal cohesion.\n\n6.  **Etiology/Trigger**: The eruption began `$10$` days after starting amoxicillin. While infections, particularly Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), are the most common triggers for EM, drugs are the second most common cause. The latency of `$7-14$` days is typical for a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction. Therefore, amoxicillin is a very plausible trigger.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**: The combination of typical `$3$`-zone target lesions, acral distribution with trunk sparing, absence of mucosal involvement, absence of systemic symptoms, and a negative Nikolsky sign provides a classic and definitive clinical picture of **Erythema Multiforme minor**, likely triggered by amoxicillin exposure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Erythema multiforme (EM) minor triggered by drug exposure; the presence of true three-zone target lesions with acral predominance and a negative Nikolsky sign favors EM over a morbilliform exanthem, which typically presents with diffuse blanchable macules and papules starting on the trunk without true targets.**\n- This option correctly identifies the condition as `EM minor` and the probable trigger as drug exposure. The justification is precise and accurate. It correctly identifies the pathognomonic features of EM (true target lesions, acral distribution) and contrasts them correctly with the features of a morbilliform eruption (maculopapular, truncal onset). It also correctly notes the significance of the negative Nikolsky sign.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Morbilliform drug eruption due to amoxicillin; the approximately $10$-day latency and antibiotic exposure are decisive, and morbilliform eruptions frequently feature true target lesions with acral onset and trunk sparing.**\n- This option incorrectly identifies the eruption type. While the timing and trigger are plausible for a drug eruption, the statement that \"morbilliform eruptions frequently feature true target lesions with acral onset and trunk sparing\" is factually incorrect. A morbilliform eruption lacks true target lesions and typically starts on the trunk. The morphology and distribution described in the case are inconsistent with a morbilliform eruption.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) secondary to amoxicillin; targetoid lesions in the setting of a new drug exposure point to SJS, and a negative Nikolsky sign is characteristic.**\n- This option is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, SJS is defined by significant mucosal erosions, which are explicitly absent. Second, the lesions in SJS are typically \"atypical targets,\" not the classic `$3$`-zone targets described. Third, the statement that a \"negative Nikolsky sign is characteristic\" of SJS is false; a positive Nikolsky sign is a hallmark of SJS/TEN.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS); the timing after drug initiation and widespread eruption with systemic immune activation best explain the findings even without mucosal disease.**\n- This option is incorrect. DRESS is a systemic illness defined by fever, hematologic abnormalities (e.g., eosinophilia), and internal organ involvement. This patient has no systemic symptoms (\"denies fever, malaise\"), and there is no information to suggest systemic involvement. Furthermore, the eruption in DRESS is most commonly morbilliform, not characterized by true target lesions.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Erythema multiforme (EM) major; the presence of target lesions with acral predominance implies EM with significant mucosal involvement even if mucosal symptoms are not reported.**\n- This option is incorrect. It rightly identifies the skin findings as EM, but incorrectly classifies it as `EM major`. The classification of `EM major` versus `EM minor` is based entirely on the presence or absence of significant mucosal disease. The claim that skin findings can *imply* mucosal involvement in the face of direct clinical evidence to the contrary (no symptoms, no findings on exam) is clinically and logically invalid. The absence of mucosal disease defines this as `EM minor`.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

You are considering erythema multiforme (EM) versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN). Erythema multiforme (EM) is classically associated with fixed target lesions with three distinct zones, frequently triggered by herpes simplex virus, and typically lacks epidermal detachment. Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) is a severe drug-mediated epidermal necrolysis spectrum disease characterized by widespread dusky macules, sheet-like epidermal detachment, and a positive Nikolsky sign.

We will formalize the update from prior to posterior probability using Bayes’ theorem.\n\nFirst, identify the prior probabilities from the institutional registry. Among $20$ similar cases, $13$ were EM and $7$ were SJS/TEN. Therefore, the pretest probability of EM is\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{EM}) = \\frac{13}{20},\n$$\nand the pretest probability of SJS/TEN is\n$$\nP(\\mathrm{SJS/TEN}) = \\frac{7}{20}.\n$$\n\nSecond, use the operating characteristics for the test result observed (negative Nikolsky sign).
