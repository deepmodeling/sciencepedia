According to standard American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) dual-probe In Situ Hybridization (ISH) methodology, the HER2/CEP17 ratio is defined as the ratio of the mean HER2 signal count per nucleus to the mean Chromosome Enumeration Probe 17 (CEP17) signal count per nucleus, computed over the same set of nuclei.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated for validity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Assay: Dual-probe Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) for Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2).\n- Methodology: American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) dual-probe In Situ Hybridization (ISH).\n- Definition of HER2/CEP17 ratio: The ratio of the mean HER2 signal count per nucleus to the mean Chromosome Enumeration Probe 17 (CEP17) signal count per nucleus.\n- Number of nuclei scored, $N$: $20$.\n- Total HER2 signals across all scored nuclei, $S_{HER2}$: $112$.\n- Total CEP17 signals across all scored nuclei, $S_{CEP17}$: $58$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a standard, validated clinical laboratory test (HER2 FISH) used in oncology, particularly for breast and gastroesophageal cancers. The parameters ($HER2$ gene, chromosome 17 centromere probe $CEP17$, number of nuclei, signal counts) and the ASCO/CAP guidelines are established and factually correct components of modern pathology practice.\n- **Well-Posed:** All data required for the calculations are provided. The definitions are explicit. The problem asks for a classification based on \"widely accepted guideline categories,\" which refers to the published and numerically defined ASCO/CAP criteria. This makes the classification unambiguous.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and technical language devoid of subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the necessary metrics from the provided data and then applying the standard ASCO/CAP classification criteria.\n\n**1. Calculation of Average HER2 Gene Copy Number per Nucleus**\nLet $\\bar{N}_{HER2}$ represent the average HER2 signal count per nucleus. This is calculated by dividing the total number of HER2 signals by the total number of nuclei scored.\n$$ \\bar{N}_{HER2} = \\frac{\\text{Total HER2 signals}}{\\text{Number of nuclei scored}} = \\frac{S_{HER2}}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{HER2} = \\frac{112}{20} = 5.6 $$\nThe average HER2 gene copy number per nucleus is exactly $5.6$. To three significant figures, this is $5.60$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Average CEP17 Signal Count per Nucleus**\nLet $\\bar{N}_{CEP17}$ represent the average CEP17 signal count per nucleus. This is calculated by dividing the total number of CEP17 signals by the total number of nuclei scored.\n$$ \\bar{N}_{CEP17} = \\frac{\\text{Total CEP17 signals}}{\\text{Number of nuclei scored}} = \\frac{S_{CEP17}}{N} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\bar{N}_{CEP17} = \\frac{58}{20} = 2.9 $$\n\n**3. Calculation of the HER2/CEP17 Ratio**\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio, denoted as $R$, is defined as the ratio of the mean HER2 signal count to the mean CEP17 signal count.\n$$ R = \\frac{\\bar{N}_{HER2}}{\\bar{N}_{CEP17}} $$\nUsing the calculated mean values:\n$$ R = \\frac{5.6}{2.9} = \\frac{112/20}{58/20} = \\frac{112}{58} \\approx 1.931034... $$\nThe HER2/CEP17 ratio, to three significant figures, is $1.93$.\n\n**4. Classification based on ASCO/CAP 2018 Dual-Probe ISH Guidelines**\nThe problem requires classification into one of five ISH groups based solely on the ISH results, without concurrent immunohistochemistry (IHC) results. The classification is performed using the exact (unrounded) computed values for $\\bar{N}_{HER2}$ and $R$. The 2018 ASCO/CAP guidelines define the groups as follows:\n\n- **Group 1 (Positive):** $R \\ge 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 4.0$\n- **Group 2 (Positive):** $R \\ge 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$\n- **Group 3 (Positive):** $R < 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 6.0$\n- **Group 4 (Equivocal):** $R < 2.0$ AND $4.0 \\le \\bar{N}_{HER2} < 6.0$\n- **Group 5 (Negative):** $R < 2.0$ AND $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$\n\nWe will now test the computed values against these criteria:\n- Calculated $\\bar{N}_{HER2} = 5.6$\n- Calculated $R = \\frac{112}{58} \\approx 1.931$\n\nWe evaluate the conditions for each group:\n- **Group 1:** The condition $R \\ge 2.0$ is not met, since $1.931 < 2.0$.\n- **Group 2:** The condition $R \\ge 2.0$ is not met.\n- **Group 3:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met. However, the condition $\\bar{N}_{HER2} \\ge 6.0$ is not met, since $5.6 < 6.0$.\n- **Group 4:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met ($1.931 < 2.0$). The condition $4.0 \\le \\bar{N}_{HER2} < 6.0$ is also met, since $4.0 \\le 5.6 < 6.0$. Both conditions for Group $4$ are satisfied.\n- **Group 5:** The condition $R < 2.0$ is met. However, the condition $\\bar{N}_{HER2} < 4.0$ is not met, since $5.6 > 4.0$.\n\nBased on this rigorous application of the guidelines, the case falls into Group 4. Clinically, a Group 4 (equivocal) result would prompt additional workup, such as performing IHC or recounting with an expanded number of nuclei, but the classification based on the initial data is unequivocally Group 4. The problem asks only for this initial classification.\n\nThe final requested answer is the integer representing the ISH Group number.",

A key metric, the Variant Allele Fraction ($VAF$), reflects the proportion of a specific genetic mutation but is influenced by the presence of non-cancerous cells. This practice problem  will teach you how to mathematically deconstruct an observed $VAF$ using tumor purity estimates. By doing so, you can calculate the Cancer Cell Fraction ($CCF$)—the true percentage of cancer cells harboring the mutation—to distinguish between foundational clonal events and later subclonal alterations.",

            "problem": "A diffuse glioma specimen is profiled by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) for the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) p.R132H substitution is observed to be $v=0.32$. Histopathology and computational deconvolution estimate the tumor purity to be $p=0.80$, meaning that $0.80$ of nucleated cells in the specimen are neoplastic. Copy number analysis shows that the IDH1 locus resides in a copy-number-neutral diploid segment without Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), so the total copy number in tumor cells is $2$ and the normal cells are diploid. In gliomas, IDH1 p.R132H is typically heterozygous in the cells that carry it.\n\nStarting explicitly from the definition of VAF as the ratio of mutant allele counts to total allele counts in a mixed population of tumor and normal cells, and from the stated copy number status, derive an expression for the fraction $f$ of tumor cells that harbor the heterozygous IDH1 p.R132H mutation. Then, compute $f$ using the provided values for $v$ and $p$. Express your final numeric answer as a decimal rounded to three significant figures. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to derive an expression for $f$, the fraction of tumor cells harboring a heterozygous mutation, based on the observed Variant Allele Fraction ($v$) and the tumor purity ($p$), and then to calculate its value.\n\nLet us begin by precisely defining the quantities involved. The Variant Allele Fraction, $v$, is defined as the ratio of the number of sequencing reads corresponding to the mutant allele to the total number of reads covering that genomic locus. In an idealized model, this corresponds to the ratio of the number of mutant alleles to the total number of alleles in the cell sample.\n$$v = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}}$$\n\nLet $N$ be the total number of nucleated cells in the specimen. The specimen is a mixture of neoplastic (tumor) cells and non-neoplastic (normal) cells.\nThe tumor purity, $p$, is given as the fraction of nucleated cells that are neoplastic.\n- Number of tumor cells, $N_T = pN$\n- Number of normal cells, $N_N = (1-p)N$\n\nThe problem states that the IDH1 locus is in a copy-number-neutral diploid segment for both tumor and normal cells. This implies that every cell in the sample contains exactly $2$ copies of the IDH1 gene locus.\nTherefore, the total number of alleles in the entire sample is:\n$$N_{\\text{total_alleles}} = 2 \\times N_T + 2 \\times N_N = 2(pN) + 2(1-p)N = 2pN + 2N - 2pN = 2N$$\n\nNext, we establish the number of mutant alleles. The mutation is the IDH1 p.R132H substitution.\n- Normal cells ($N_N$) do not carry the mutation. They are genetically wild-type at this locus. Thus, the number of mutant alleles in the normal cell population is $0$.\n- The tumor cell population ($N_T$) is itself a mixture. Let $f$ be the fraction of tumor cells that harbor the mutation.\n  - The number of mutated tumor cells is $f \\times N_T = f p N$. The problem states that this mutation is heterozygous in the cells that carry it. This means each mutated cell contains $1$ mutant allele and $1$ wild-type allele.\n  - The number of non-mutated tumor cells is $(1-f) \\times N_T = (1-f) p N$. These cells contain $2$ wild-type alleles and $0$ mutant alleles.\n\nThe total number of mutant alleles in the sample, $N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}}$, is contributed solely by the mutated tumor cells.\n$$N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}} = (\\text{Number of mutated tumor cells}) \\times (\\text{Number of mutant alleles per mutated cell})$$\n$$N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}} = (f p N) \\times 1 = fpN$$\n\nNow, we can substitute our expressions for the number of mutant alleles and the total number of alleles into the definition of VAF:\n$$v = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant_alleles}}}{N_{\\text{total_alleles}}} = \\frac{fpN}{2N}$$\n\nThe total number of cells, $N$, cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the relationship between $v$, $f$, and $p$:\n$$v = \\frac{fp}{2}$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for an expression for $f$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for $f$:\n$$2v = fp$$\n$$f = \\frac{2v}{p}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the fraction of tumor cells that harbor the heterozygous mutation.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the value of $f$ using the provided data: $v = 0.32$ and $p = 0.80$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$f = \\frac{2 \\times 0.32}{0.80}$$\n$$f = \\frac{0.64}{0.80}$$\n$$f = 0.8$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$f = 0.800$$\nThis result indicates that an estimated $80.0\\%$ of the neoplastic cells in the specimen carry the heterozygous IDH1 p.R132H mutation.",

            "problem": "A precision oncology laboratory is modeling the competition between a drug-sensitive subclone and a drug-resistant subclone during targeted therapy for solid and hematologic malignancies with actionable molecular alterations. Assume the following fundamental basis: clonal population size follows the exponential law defined by the ordinary differential equation $dX/dt = r X$ for each subclone under constant treatment pressure over the relevant time window, where $X$ is population size and $r$ is the net per-capita growth rate. Let $S(t)$ denote the size of the sensitive subclone and $R(t)$ denote the size of the resistant subclone, with initial sizes $S(0) = S_{0}$ and $R(0) = R_{0}$. Assume $S(t) = S_{0} e^{r_{S} t}$ and $R(t) = R_{0} e^{r_{R} t}$, where $r_{S}$ and $r_{R}$ are constants determined by therapy and biology. In practice, only initial fractions are needed because any common initial total cancels in the ratio; thus define $f_{S0} = S_{0}/(S_{0}+R_{0})$ and $f_{R0} = R_{0}/(S_{0}+R_{0})$ with $f_{S0} + f_{R0} = 1$. Define “resistant dominance” as the earliest time $t \\ge 0$ at which $R(t) \\ge S(t)$. Your task is to implement a program that computes the time to resistant dominance from $(f_{R0}, f_{S0}, r_{R}, r_{S})$. If dominance is mathematically impossible from the given initial condition and growth rates (for example, $f_{R0} = 0$ or $r_{R} \\le r_{S}$ when $f_{R0} < f_{S0}$), the program must return a sentinel value.

This time is defined as the point of \"resistant dominance\".\n\nThe populations of the sensitive and resistant subclones are governed by exponential growth laws:\n$$S(t) = S_{0} e^{r_{S} t}$$\n$$R(t) = R_{0} e^{r_{R} t}$$\nwhere $S_0$ and $R_0$ are the initial population sizes at $t=0$, and $r_S$ and $r_R$ are the respective net per-capita growth rates under therapy.\n\nResistant dominance is achieved at the earliest time $t \\ge 0$ satisfying the inequality:\n$$R(t) \\ge S(t)$$\nSubstituting the population models into this inequality yields:\n$$R_{0} e^{r_{R} t} \\ge S_{0} e^{r_{S} t}$$\nThe initial population sizes can be expressed using the initial fractions $f_{R0} = R_{0}/(S_{0}+R_{0})$ and $f_{S0} = S_{0}/(S_{0}+R_{0})$. The ratio $S_0/R_0$ is equivalent to $f_{S0}/f_{R0}$. We now analyze the inequality based on the initial conditions and growth rate parameters.\n\n**Case 1: Initial Dominance**\nIf the resistant subclone is already dominant or of equal size at baseline ($t=0$), then $R_0 \\ge S_0$. This corresponds to an initial resistant fraction $f_{R0} \\ge 0.5$. In this scenario, the condition for dominance is met at the earliest possible time, which is $t=0$.\n\n**Case 2: No Resistant Subclone at Baseline**\nIf there is no resistant subclone initially, then $R_0 = 0$ (and thus $f_{R0} = 0$). The population $R(t)$ will remain $0$ for all $t$. Assuming $S_0 > 0$ (i.e., $f_{S0} > 0$), the condition $R(t) \\ge S(t)$ can never be met. Therefore, dominance is impossible.\n\n**Case 3: Non-Dominant Resistant Subclone at Baseline**\nThis is the most general case, where $0 < R_0 < S_0$ (which implies $0 < f_{R0} < 0.5$). To solve for $t$, we manipulate the inequality. Since $S_0$ and $R_0$ are positive, we can rearrange the terms without ambiguity:\n$$\\frac{e^{r_{R} t}}{e^{r_{S} t}} \\ge \\frac{S_{0}}{R_{0}}$$\n$$e^{(r_{R} - r_{S})t} \\ge \\frac{S_{0}}{R_{0}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, which is a monotonically increasing function, preserves the inequality:\n$$\\ln(e^{(r_{R} - r_{S})t}) \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{0}}{R_{0}}\\right)$$\n$$(r_{R} - r_{S})t \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{S_{0}}{R_{0}}\\right)$$\nThe solution for $t$ now depends on the sign of the differential growth rate, $\\Delta r = r_R - r_S$.\n\n**Subcase 3a: Positive Differential Growth ($r_R > r_S$)**\nIf the resistant subclone has a growth advantage ($r_R - r_S > 0$), we can divide by this positive term to isolate $t$:\n$$t \\ge \\frac{\\ln(S_{0}/R_{0})}{r_{R} - r_{S}}$$\nSince we are in the scenario where $S_0 > R_0$, the ratio $S_0/R_0 > 1$, and thus its logarithm $\\ln(S_0/R_0)$ is positive. The denominator $r_R - r_S$ is also positive. The resulting time is therefore positive. The earliest time $t$ that satisfies this condition is the equality:\n$$t = \\frac{\\ln(S_{0}/R_{0})}{r_{R} - r_{S}} = \\frac{\\ln(f_{S0}/f_{R0})}{r_{R} - r_{S}}$$\n\n**Subcase 3b: Non-Positive Differential Growth ($r_R \\le r_S$)**\nIf the resistant subclone has no growth advantage ($r_R - r_S \\le 0$), two possibilities arise:\n- If $r_R < r_S$, then $r_R - r_S$ is negative. Dividing the inequality by this negative term reverses its direction:\n$$t \\le \\frac{\\ln(S_{0}/R_{0})}{r_{R} - r_{S}}$$\nThe numerator $\\ln(S_0/R_0)$ is positive, while the denominator $r_R - r_S$ is negative. The right-hand side is therefore a negative value. The inequality requires $t$ to be less than or equal to a negative number. Since we seek a solution for $t \\ge 0$, no such solution exists.\n- If $r_R = r_S$, the inequality becomes $0 \\cdot t \\ge \\ln(S_0/R_0)$. Since $S_0 > R_0$, the right-hand side is positive. The inequality $0 \\ge (\\text{positive number})$ is false for all $t$.\nIn both situations where $r_R \\le r_S$ (given an initially non-dominant resistant clone), dominance is mathematically impossible.\n\n**Summary of the Algorithm:**\nGiven parameters $(f_{R0}, f_{S0}, r_{R}, r_{S})$:\n1.  If $f_{R0} \\ge 0.5$, resistant dominance occurs at $t = 0$.\n2.  If $f_{R0} = 0$, resistant dominance is impossible. The result is the sentinel value $-1.0$.\n3.  If $0 < f_{R0} < 0.5$:\n    a. If $r_R \\le r_S$, resistant dominance is impossible. The result is $-1.0$.\n    b. If $r_R > r_S$, the time to dominance is $t = \\frac{\\ln(f_{S0}/f_{R0})}{r_R - r_S}$.\n\nThis logic is applied to each test case to compute the time to dominance, which is then rounded to three decimal places. For impossible cases, the specified sentinel value of $-1.000$ is used.",
