            "problem": "A student is asked to distinguish the typical localization of tenderness in epididymitis from that in orchitis and to explain the underlying pathophysiology of pain distribution using fundamental principles. Consider two patients. Patient $1$ is a sexually active male aged $24$ years with dysuria and unilateral scrotal pain. On physical examination, there is focal point tenderness over the posterior-inferior pole of the right testis, corresponding to the epididymal tail, with relative sparing of the remainder of the testis. Patient $2$ is an adolescent aged $17$ years recovering from parotitis who presents with testicular swelling and diffuse tenderness involving the entire testis. \n\nUsing the following fundamental base and observations, select the single best statement that accounts for the different distributions of pain:\n- Inflammation is defined as a tissue response characterized by arteriolar dilation, increased microvascular permeability, and exudation of protein-rich fluid with leukocyte recruitment; edema accumulates where microvascular leakage occurs.\n- Pain arises when nociceptors are activated by mechanical stretch, chemical mediators (for example, bradykinin and prostaglandins), and ischemia; the perceived distribution depends on the anatomical compartment that is inflamed.\n- The testicular parenchyma is enclosed by the tunica albuginea, which has inelastic properties that restrict expansion; the epididymis is an extra-testicular, posteriorly located tubular structure with a head, body, and tail, not confined within the tunica albuginea.\n- Scrotal somatic sensation arises from scrotal wall nerves, while visceral afferents from the testis travel to spinal segments $T10$–$T12$; palpation-based tenderness reflects the site of inflamed tissue and mechanical pressure transmission within or outside rigid compartments.\n\nWhich option most accurately explains and predicts the pain distribution in Patient $1$ (epididymitis localized to the tail) versus Patient $2$ (diffuse orchitis)?\n\nA. Epididymitis produces focal tenderness at the posterior-inferior pole because inflammation is confined to the extra-testicular epididymal tail outside the tunica albuginea; orchitis produces diffuse tenderness because inelastic encapsulation by the tunica albuginea spreads edema-induced pressure and nociceptor activation throughout the parenchyma.\n\nB. Both epididymitis and orchitis primarily produce focal tenderness at the superior pole, because the tunica vaginalis partitions the testis into compartments that isolate inflammation to specific quadrants.\n\nC.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following data, definitions, and conditions:\n\n**Clinical Scenarios:**\n- **Patient $1$:** A sexually active male aged $24$ years with dysuria and unilateral scrotal pain. Physical examination reveals focal point tenderness over the posterior-inferior pole of the right testis, corresponding to the epididymal tail, with relative sparing of the remainder of the testis. This is presented as a case of epididymitis.\n- **Patient $2$:** An adolescent aged $17$ years recovering from parotitis, presenting with testicular swelling and diffuse tenderness involving the entire testis. This is presented as a case of orchitis.\n\n**Fundamental Principles:**\n- **Principle of Inflammation:** Inflammation is a tissue response involving arteriolar dilation, increased microvascular permeability, and exudation of protein-rich fluid with leukocyte recruitment. Edema accumulates where this microvascular leakage occurs.\n- **Principle of Pain:** Pain arises from nociceptor activation by mechanical stretch, chemical mediators (e.g., bradykinin, prostaglandins), and ischemia. The perceived distribution of pain depends on the anatomical compartment that is inflamed.\n- **Principle of Anatomy:** The testicular parenchyma is enclosed by the tunica albuginea, an inelastic structure that restricts expansion. The epididymis is an extra-testicular, posteriorly located tubular structure (head, body, tail) not confined within the tunica albuginea.\n- **Principle of Sensation and Palpation:** Scrotal somatic sensation is mediated by scrotal wall nerves. Visceral afferents from the testis travel to spinal segments $T10$–$T12$. Palpation-based tenderness reflects the site of inflamed tissue and mechanical pressure transmission.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement will now be validated for scientific soundness, objectivity, and well-posedness.\n\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is firmly grounded in established medical science, specifically urology and pathology. The clinical vignettes for epididymitis (Patient $1$) and mumps orchitis (Patient $2$) are classic and medically accurate presentations. The four fundamental principles provided are correct summaries of the pathophysiology of inflammation, pain, and the relevant anatomy and neuroanatomy of the testis and epididymis.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It presents two distinct clinical outcomes (focal vs. diffuse tenderness) and provides the necessary anatomical and physiological principles to deduce the reason for this difference. The question asks for the single best statement that accounts for these differences, which implies a unique, correct explanation exists among the options, derivable from the provided facts.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and clinical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims. The case descriptions are factual observations.\n\n**Conclusion of Validation:** The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a valid problem that requires the synthesis of provided principles to explain clinical findings.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Correct Answer and Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on a valid problem statement, I will proceed to derive the explanation and evaluate the options.\n\n#### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to explain why inflammation of the epididymis (epididymitis) causes focal pain, while inflammation of the testis (orchitis) causes diffuse pain. The provided principles guide this explanation.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Epididymitis (Patient $1$):**\n    - The inflammation is located in the epididymis, specifically the tail, which is described as an **extra-testicular** structure.\n    - The epididymis is **not confined within the tunica albuginea**.\n    - According to the principle of inflammation, edema and cellular infiltrate will accumulate in the epididymal tail.\n    - Because this structure is not in a rigid, confined space, the inflammatory process (and a concomitant increase in volume and pressure) remains localized to the epididymis itself.\n    - The principle of pain states that nociceptors are activated by stretch and chemical mediators at the site of inflammation. Therefore, palpation pressure applied directly to the inflamed epididymal tail will elicit sharp, localized tenderness. The rest of the testicle is spared, as it is anatomically separate and not inflamed.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Orchitis (Patient $2$):**\n    - The inflammation is located in the **testicular parenchyma**.\n    - The testicular parenchyma is **enclosed by the tunica albuginea**, which is described as **inelastic**.\n    - When inflammation occurs within this non-expandable compartment, the accumulating edema and inflammatory exudate cannot escape. This leads to a rapid and significant increase in intra-testicular pressure.\n    - This increased pressure is transmitted throughout the entire parenchyma, as it is a closed hydraulic system.\n    - According to the principle of pain, this widespread increase in pressure causes diffuse mechanical stretch of the parenchyma and compression of tissues, leading to ischemia and activation of nociceptors throughout the entire organ.\n    - Consequently, the entire testis becomes diffusely tender to palpation, not just one specific point.\n\n**Conclusion:** The differential pain distribution is a direct consequence of a fundamental anatomical difference: epididymitis is an inflammation of an unconfined, extra-testicular structure, leading to localized pain, whereas orchitis is an inflammation within a rigidly confined space, leading to a diffuse increase in pressure and generalized pain.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Epididymitis produces focal tenderness at the posterior-inferior pole because inflammation is confined to the extra-testicular epididymal tail outside the tunica albuginea; orchitis produces diffuse tenderness because inelastic encapsulation by the tunica albuginea spreads edema-induced pressure and nociceptor activation throughout the parenchyma.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement perfectly aligns with the derivation above. It correctly identifies that the extra-testicular location of the epididymis leads to focal tenderness. It also correctly attributes the diffuse tenderness of orchitis to the inelastic nature of the tunica albuginea, which causes pressure to be distributed throughout the entire testicular parenchyma. This option correctly synthesizes the principles of anatomy, inflammation, and pain.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Both epididymitis and orchitis primarily produce focal tenderness at the superior pole, because the tunica vaginalis partitions the testis into compartments that isolate inflammation to specific quadrants.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is factually incorrect on multiple counts. First, it contradicts the problem's own data, which states Patient $1$ has posterior-inferior tenderness and Patient $2$ has diffuse tenderness. Second, the tunica vaginalis is a serous membrane covering the testis; it is the tunica albuginea that sends septa into the testis, forming lobules, but this does not explain the clinical difference in pain patterns as described. The primary claim that both conditions cause focal superior pole tenderness is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Pain distribution is determined chiefly by venous drainage patterns: epididymitis drains to the pampiniform plexus, promoting diffuse testicular pain, whereas orchitis drains to cremasteric veins, limiting tenderness to the superior testis.**\n- **Evaluation:** The anatomical claims regarding venous drainage are incorrect. Both the testis and the epididymis drain primarily via the pampiniform plexus, which coalesces to form the testicular vein. The proposed consequences for pain distribution are also false and contradict the clinical findings in the problem statement (focal pain in epididymitis, diffuse in orchitis).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Epididymitis causes diffuse tenderness by endotoxin dissemination through seminal fluid into the testicular parenchyma, while orchitis is focal due to sequestration by the blood-testis barrier limiting mediator spread.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement reverses the clinical facts presented in the problem. Epididymitis is described as causing focal tenderness, not diffuse. Orchitis is described as causing diffuse tenderness, not focal. The proposed mechanisms are also flawed. While ascending bacterial infection can cause epididymitis, it does not typically cause diffuse testicular pain unless it progresses to epididymo-orchitis. The idea that a viral orchitis would be focal due to the blood-testis barrier is unsubstantiated; breakdown of this barrier is part of the pathophysiology.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Differences in nerve supply mean the epididymal tail is innervated only by posterior scrotal somatic nerves, so pain is perceived locally, whereas testicular visceral afferents project exclusively to the suprapubic region, making orchitis rarely cause scrotal tenderness on palpation.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement contains significant neuroanatomical errors. The epididymis and testis share a common visceral nerve supply (from the renal and aortic plexuses, traveling to spinal segments $T10-L1$). The claim that orchitis rarely causes scrotal tenderness on palpation is clinically false and directly contradicted by the description of Patient $2$, who has \"diffuse tenderness involving the entire testis\" on examination. Palpation directly assesses local tenderness.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Patient Age**: A boy aged $6$ years.\n-   **Clinical Presentation**: Second episode of unilateral scrotal pain and swelling.\n-   **Physical Examination**: Tenderness localized to the epididymis; the testis is non-tender. He is afebrile.\n-   **Laboratory Findings**: Urinalysis shows pyuria. Urine culture grows *Escherichia coli* at $>10^5$ colony-forming units per milliliter.\n-   **Imaging**: Ultrasound of the urinary tract reveals posterior urethral valves (PUV).\n-   **Relevant History**: No history of sexual activity, instrumentation, or known immunodeficiency.\n-   **Question**: Select the option(s) that most accurately explain the etiologies of pediatric epididymitis in this context and how congenital urinary anomalies can alter infection routes.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem presents a classic and medically accurate clinical vignette. The association between posterior urethral valves (a congenital urinary obstruction), urinary tract infection (UTI) with a coliform bacterium (*E. coli*), and subsequent epididymitis in a prepubertal male is a well-established pathophysiological sequence in pediatric urology. The data are consistent with this diagnosis.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly formulated. It asks for the pathophysiological explanation(s) for the given clinical scenario based on fundamental principles of anatomy and microbiology. A definitive answer can be derived from established medical science.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise and clinical. All information provided is objective data from a patient case.\n\nThe problem statement is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradictions. It is a valid, well-posed problem based on established principles of pathology and anatomy.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Correct Answer and Evaluation of Options\n\n#### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe case describes epididymitis in a $6$-year-old boy. The key findings are a urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by *Escherichia coli* and a congenital structural anomaly, posterior urethral valves (PUV). To understand the link, we must consider the anatomy of the male genitourinary tract and the pathophysiology of urinary obstruction.\n\n1.  **Anatomy of the Genitourinary Tract**: There is a continuous ductal system connecting the epididymis to the urethra. The path is as follows: epididymis $\\rightarrow$ vas deferens $\\rightarrow$ ejaculatory duct $\\rightarrow$ posterior urethra. The ejaculatory ducts open into the prostatic portion of the posterior urethra. Urine from the bladder also passes through the posterior urethra to exit the body. This continuous pathway allows for potential retrograde (backward) travel of pathogens from the urethra to the epididymis.\n\n2.  **Pathophysiology of Posterior Urethral Valves (PUV)**: PUV are obstructive mucosal folds located in the posterior urethra. This obstruction to urinary outflow has several critical consequences:\n    *   **Increased Intravesical Pressure**: The bladder must contract with greater force to empty against the obstruction, leading to chronically elevated pressure inside the bladder (intravesical pressure).\n    *   **Urine Stasis**: The bladder may fail to empty completely, resulting in a residual volume of stagnant urine.\n    *   **Reflux**: High intravesical pressure can overcome the natural anti-reflux mechanisms. This can cause vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters. Crucially, this high pressure can also force urine to flow backward from the posterior urethra into the ejaculatory ducts.\n\n3.  **Pathogenesis of Infection**:\n    *   **Ascending UTI**: The most common route for a UTI is ascending infection. Commensal bacteria from the perineum and gastrointestinal tract (such as *E. coli*) colonize the periurethral area and ascend the urethra into the bladder. In the presence of urine stasis caused by PUV, these bacteria can multiply to high concentrations ($>10^5$ CFU/mL), establishing a UTI, as confirmed by the urine culture in this case.\n    *   **Retrograde Spread to the Epididymis**: The combination of infected urine in the bladder and high intravesical pressures due to PUV creates the conditions for epididymitis. During voiding or due to high bladder pressure, infected urine is forced retrogradely from the posterior urethra into the open ejaculatory ducts. From there, the bacteria travel down the vas deferens to the epididymis, seeding an infection and causing inflammation (epididymitis). This is known as canalicular or retrograde spread.\n\n4.  **Etiology by Age Group**: The common pathogens for epididymitis vary by age and sexual activity.\n    *   **Prepubertal Boys**: As in this case, the etiology is almost always associated with a UTI and/or an underlying urogenital anomaly. The causative agents are typically enteric, coliform bacteria like *E. coli*, *Klebsiella*, and *Proteus*.\n    *   **Sexually Active Adolescents and Adults**: The most common pathogens are sexually transmitted organisms, primarily *Chlamydia trachomatis* and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*.\n\nBased on these principles, the patient's epididymitis is a direct consequence of his UTI, which in turn was facilitated by his PUV. The PUV created an environment of stasis for the UTI to develop and provided the pressure gradient to force infected urine retrogradely into the epididymis.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In prepubertal children, the typical pathogens of epididymitis are Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis acquired via sexual transmission.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect. While true for sexually active adolescents and adults, it is false for prepubertal children. The problem explicitly states the patient is $6$ years old and not sexually active. In this demographic, the pathogens are typically enteric bacteria associated with UTIs, such as the *E. coli* found in this patient's urine.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Posterior urethral valves increase intravesical pressure and predispose to infected urine reflux into the prostatic urethra and ejaculatory ducts, allowing retrograde spread through the vas deferens to the epididymis.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement provides a precise and accurate description of the pathophysiology linking PUV to epididymitis. The obstruction from PUV increases bladder pressure, which drives the reflux of infected urine from the posterior urethra into the ejaculatory ducts and subsequently via the vas deferens to the epididymis. This matches the established scientific model and explains all features of the case.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Congenital urinary outflow obstruction reduces periurethral colonization by coliform bacteria, thereby lowering the risk of epididymitis.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement claims the opposite of the known effect. Urinary outflow obstruction leads to urine stasis, which is a major risk factor for the proliferation of bacteria and the development of a UTI. A UTI significantly *increases*, not lowers, the risk of epididymitis via retrograde spread. The premise is fundamentally flawed.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Coliform bacteria such as Escherichia coli can ascend from the periurethral area into the urinary tract in children, especially when obstruction or stasis is present.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement accurately describes the initial and necessary step in the patient's disease process: the development of a UTI. *E. coli* is a coliform bacterium. The ascending route is the standard mechanism for UTIs. Obstruction and stasis, as caused by PUV, are critical predisposing factors that allow the infection to take hold. This statement correctly explains the origin of the infected urine that subsequently caused the epididymitis.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. Epididymitis in this age group commonly arises from hematogenous seeding, and structural anomalies do not materially alter the infection route.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect. While hematogenous (blood-borne) seeding is a possible route for certain infections (e.g., mumps orchitis), it is not the common mechanism for bacterial epididymitis in children, particularly when a concurrent UTI and a structural anomaly are present. In this case, the structural anomaly (PUV) and the associated UTI with *E. coli* provide a clear, direct, and more plausible canalicular route. The claim that anomalies do not alter the route is patently false; they are the central factor in this patient's pathophysiology.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "problem": "A clinician evaluates acute scrotal pain and uses testicular elevation to elicit the Prehn sign. A \"positive\" Prehn sign is defined as relief of pain with elevation of the affected testis; classically this is associated with inflammatory epididymo-orchitis, whereas a \"negative\" Prehn sign (no relief of pain on elevation) is more consistent with testicular torsion. From a pathology perspective, pain relief in inflammatory epididymo-orchitis occurs because elevation reduces tension on an inflamed, hyperemic epididymis and spermatic cord, whereas in torsion, ischemia due to twisting of the spermatic cord persists despite elevation because the mechanical obstruction of blood flow remains unchanged. Assume a hospital cohort of acute scrotum presentations with a pretest probability of torsion of $P(\\text{torsion}) = 0.30$. The Prehn sign has limited performance: the probability of a positive sign in torsion is $P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion}) = 0.15$, and the probability of a positive sign in non-torsion inflammatory cases (predominantly epididymo-orchitis) is $P(+ \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion}) = 0.70$.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data for a Bayesian analysis of the Prehn sign:\n- **Pathophysiological Premise**: Pain relief with elevation (positive Prehn sign) is associated with inflammation (epididymo-orchitis) due to tension relief, while persistent pain (negative Prehn sign) is associated with torsion due to fixed mechanical obstruction.\n- **Pretest Probability (Prior)** of torsion: $P(\\text{torsion}) = 0.30$.\n- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of a positive sign given the patient has torsion is $P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion}) = 0.15$.\n- **Conditional Probability**: The probability of a positive sign given the patient does not have torsion (i.e., has an inflammatory condition) is $P(+ \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion}) = 0.70$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound and well-posed.\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness**: The description of the Prehn sign's mechanism is consistent with established clinical pathophysiology. The use of Bayesian reasoning to update diagnostic probability based on a clinical finding is a standard and powerful tool in evidence-based medicine. The probabilities provided are hypothetical but plausible for a clinical sign with known limitations.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all the necessary quantitative information to calculate the posterior probabilities using Bayes' theorem. The question is unambiguous and asks for a specific set of results (the mechanism and two posterior probabilities).\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using objective clinical and mathematical language.\n\n**Conclusion of Validation:** The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Correct Answer and Evaluation of Options\n\n#### Principle-Based Derivation\nWe will use Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of torsion given a positive sign, $P(\\text{torsion} \\mid +)$, and given a negative sign, $P(\\text{torsion} \\mid -)$.\n\nFirst, we define our terms and derive necessary probabilities:\n-   $P(\\text{torsion}) = 0.30$\n-   $P(\\neg \\text{torsion}) = 1 - P(\\text{torsion}) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$\n-   $P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion}) = 0.15$\n-   $P(+ \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion}) = 0.70$\n-   $P(- \\mid \\text{torsion}) = 1 - P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion}) = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n-   $P(- \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion}) = 1 - P(+ \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion}) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$\n\n**Calculation for a Positive Prehn Sign:**\nWe need to find $P(\\text{torsion} \\mid +) = \\frac{P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion}) P(\\text{torsion})}{P(+)}$.\nFirst, find the total probability of a positive sign, $P(+)$, using the law of total probability:\n$P(+) = P(+ \\mid \\text{torsion})P(\\text{torsion}) + P(+ \\mid \\neg \\text{torsion})P(\\neg \\text{torsion})$\n$P(+) = (0.15)(0.30) + (0.70)(0.70) = 0.045 + 0.49 = 0.535$.\nNow, calculate the posterior probability:\n$P(\\text{torsion} \\mid +) = \\frac{0.045}{0.535} \\approx 0.084$. So, the probability of torsion drops to about $0.08$.\n\n**Calculation for a Negative Prehn Sign:**\nWe need to find $P(\\text{torsion} \\mid -) = \\frac{P(- \\mid \\text{torsion}) P(\\text{torsion})}{P(-)}$.\nFirst, find the total probability of a negative sign, $P(-)$:\n$P(-) = 1 - P(+) = 1 - 0.535 = 0.465$.\nNow, calculate the posterior probability:\n$P(\\text{torsion} \\mid -) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{0.465} = \\frac{0.255}{0.465} \\approx 0.548$. So, the probability of torsion rises to about $0.55$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n-   Mechanism: Elevation relieves inflammatory pain but not ischemic pain from torsion.\n-   A positive Prehn sign lowers the probability of torsion from $0.30$ to approx. $0.08$.\n-   A negative Prehn sign raises the probability of torsion from $0.30$ to approx. $0.55$.\n\n#### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Elevation reduces tension on inflamed structures, explaining relief in epididymo-orchitis; torsion pain persists due to fixed vascular compromise. A positive Prehn sign lowers the posterior probability of torsion to approximately $0.08$, whereas a negative Prehn sign raises it to approximately $0.55$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This option correctly describes the pathophysiological mechanism. The calculated posterior probabilities also match our derivation exactly.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Elevation decompresses a twisted spermatic cord, explaining relief in torsion; persistent pain with elevation suggests epididymo-orchitis. A positive Prehn sign raises the posterior probability of torsion to approximately $0.55$, whereas a negative Prehn sign lowers it to approximately $0.08$.**\n- **Evaluation:** The mechanism described is incorrect; it is the reverse of the actual clinical sign. The interpretation of the probability changes is also reversed (a positive sign lowers probability, not raises it).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Elevation does not differentially affect inflammatory versus ischemic pain; the Prehn sign has no diagnostic value. The posterior probability of torsion remains at $0.30$ after either a positive or negative sign.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is false. The provided conditional probabilities clearly show a differential effect, and our calculations confirm that the posterior probability changes, meaning the sign has diagnostic value.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Elevation mainly abolishes ischemic pain in torsion; in inflammation, pain is fixed. A positive Prehn sign lowers torsion probability to approximately $0.21$, whereas a negative Prehn sign raises it to approximately $0.79$.**\n- **Evaluation:** The mechanism described is incorrect. The calculated probabilities are also incorrect and do not follow from the data provided in the problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
