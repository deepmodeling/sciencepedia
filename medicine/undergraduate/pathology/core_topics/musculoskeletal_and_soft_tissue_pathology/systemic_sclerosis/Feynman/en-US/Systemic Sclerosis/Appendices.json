            "problem": "A 52-year-old individual presents with features suggestive of systemic sclerosis, including sclerodactyly (skin thickening limited to the fingers and distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints), fingertip pitting scars (without active digital tip ulcers), telangiectasia on the face and hands, abnormal nailfold capillaries on capillaroscopy, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and a positive anti-centromere antibody. There is no skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints, no interstitial lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography, and no pulmonary arterial hypertension on right heart catheterization.\n\nUse the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for systemic sclerosis, which assign weighted points across domains, with the following foundational rules:\n- The classification score is the sum of weighted points across domains. Within a domain, only the highest applicable item is counted. The domains and weights are:\n  1. Finger skin thickening domain: puffy fingers $2$; sclerodactyly (skin thickening distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints) $4$; skin thickening of both hands extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints $9$. If the proximal item ($9$) is present, this alone is sufficient for classification.\n  2. Fingertip lesions domain: digital tip ulcers $2$; fingertip pitting scars $3$.\n  3. Telangiectasia $2$.\n  4. Abnormal nailfold capillaries $2$.\n  5. Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease $2$.\n  6. Raynaud’s phenomenon $3$.\n  7. Systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies (anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase I, or anti–RNA polymerase III) $3$.\n- A total classification score $\\geq 9$ classifies the patient as systemic sclerosis.\n\nCalculate the total classification score $S$ for this patient based on the given features and determine whether the score meets the classification threshold. Report your final answer as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} S & I \\end{pmatrix}$, where $I = 1$ if the criteria are met and $I = 0$ otherwise.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a classification score for systemic sclerosis based on a set of clinical features and a specific scoring system, the 2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) criteria. The final output should be a row matrix containing the total score and a binary indicator for whether the classification threshold is met.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe clinical features of the 52-year-old individual are:\n1.  Sclerodactyly (skin thickening limited to the fingers and distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints).\n2.  No skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints.\n3.

Positive anti-centromere antibody.\n9.  No interstitial lung disease on high-resolution computed tomography.\n10. No pulmonary arterial hypertension on right heart catheterization.\n\nThe 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria assign points as follows, with only the highest score within a domain being counted:\n- **Domain 1 (Finger skin thickening):** Puffy fingers ($2$ points); Sclerodactyly ($4$ points); Skin thickening proximal to metacarpophalangeal joints ($9$ points).\n- **Domain 2 (Fingertip lesions):** Digital tip ulcers ($2$ points); Fingertip pitting scars ($3$ points).\n- **Domain 3 (Telangiectasia):** $2$ points.\n- **Domain 4 (Abnormal nailfold capillaries):** $2$ points.\n- **Domain 5 (Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease):** $2$ points.\n- **Domain 6 (Raynaud’s phenomenon):** $3$ points.\n- **Domain 7 (Systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies):** $3$ points for anti-centromere, anti-topoisomerase I, or anti–RNA polymerase III.\n\nA total score $S \\geq 9$ classifies the patient as having systemic sclerosis. The classification indicator $I$ is $1$ if the criteria are met, and $0$ otherwise.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the established 2013 ACR/EULAR classification criteria, a standard tool in rheumatology. The problem provides all necessary data (patient features and scoring rules) to calculate a unique, deterministic score. The language is precise and free of ambiguity or subjective claims. The task is a formal application of a rule-based algorithm, which is a valid logical problem. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of the Total Classification Score\n\nLet $S$ be the total classification score. We will calculate the score by summing the points from each of the seven domains, adhering to the rule that only the highest-scoring item in each domain is counted.\n\n- **Domain 1: Finger skin thickening**\nThe patient has \"sclerodactyly (skin thickening limited to the fingers and distal to the metacarpophalangeal joints)\". The score for this item is $4$. The patient does not have skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints (which would score $9$), nor are \"puffy fingers\" mentioned as the primary finding. Thus, the score for this domain is $4$.\n\n- **Domain 2: Fingertip lesions**\nThe patient has \"fingertip pitting scars\". The score for this item is $3$. The patient does not have active digital tip ulcers (which would score $2$). Since $3 > 2$, the highest applicable score for this domain is $3$.\n\n- **Domain 3: Telangiectasia**\nThe patient has \"telangiectasia on the face and hands\". The score for this item is $2$.\n\n- **Domain 4: Abnormal nailfold capillaries**\nThe patient has \"abnormal nailfold capillaries on capillaroscopy\". The score for this item is $2$.\n\n- **Domain 5: Pulmonary arterial hypertension and/or interstitial lung disease**\nThe patient has \"no interstitial lung disease\" and \"no pulmonary arterial hypertension\". Therefore, no points are awarded for this domain. The score is $0$.\n\n- **Domain 6: Raynaud’s phenomenon**\nThe patient has \"Raynaud’s phenomenon\". The score for this item is $3$.\n\n- **Domain 7: Systemic sclerosis-related autoantibodies**\nThe patient has a \"positive anti-centromere antibody\". This is one of the specific SSc-related autoantibodies listed. The score for this item is $3$.\n\nThe total classification score $S$ is the sum of the points from each domain:\n$$S = (\\text{Score}_{Domain 1}) + (\\text{Score}_{Domain 2}) + (\\text{Score}_{Domain 3}) + (\\text{Score}_{Domain 4}) + (\\text{Score}_{Domain 5}) + (\\text\n{Score}_{Domain 6}) + (\\text{Score}_{Domain 7})$$\n$$S = 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 3 + 3$$\n$$S = 17$$\n\n### Step 4: Determine Classification Status\n\nThe threshold for classification is a total score $S \\geq 9$. The calculated score is $S = 17$.\nSince $17 \\geq 9$, the criteria for classifying the patient as having systemic sclerosis are met.\nTherefore, the indicator variable $I$ is equal to $1$.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} S & I \\end{pmatrix}$.\nSubstituting the calculated values, we get $\\begin{pmatrix} 17 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The $17$ regions are: face, anterior chest, abdomen, right and left upper arms, right and left forearms, right and left hands, right and left fingers, right and left thighs, right and left lower legs, and right and left feet.

She reports progressive exertional dyspnea over $6$ months. Physical examination reveals numerous blanchable telangiectasias on the lips, face, and hands; the fingers are mildly puffy without skin thickening extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, and there are no fingertip ulcers or pitting scars. Nailfold capillaroscopy demonstrates giant capillaries, hemorrhages, and capillary dropout consistent with a scleroderma pattern. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest shows no interstitial lung disease.

The patient requires interstitial lung disease to count the pulmonary item; pulmonary arterial hypertension alone does not contribute to the score.",
            "solution": "The validity of the problem statement must first be established.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe clinical data provided for the patient are as follows:\n- Age: $38$-year-old woman.\n- History of Present Illness: $18$ months of Raynaud’s phenomenon; $6$ months of progressive exertional dyspnea.\n- Physical Examination: Telangiectasias on lips, face, and hands; puffy fingers without skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints; no fingertip ulcers or pitting scars.\n- Nailfold Capillaroscopy: Scleroderma pattern (giant capillaries, hemorrhages, and capillary dropout).\n- Imaging: High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest shows no interstitial lung disease (ILD).\n- Hemodynamics: Transthoracic echocardiography suggests elevated pulmonary pressures. Right heart catheterization (RHC) confirms pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) with mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) $>20$ mmHg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) $<15$ mmHg, and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR).\n- Serology: Negative for anticentromere, anti-topoisomerase I (anti–Scl-$70$), and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies.\n- The question requires classification based on the $2013$ American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for SSc.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a detailed, internally consistent clinical vignette and asks for the application of a standardized, internationally accepted medical classification system (the $2013$ ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc). The data regarding the RHC diagnosis of PAH (mPAP $>20$ mmHg, PCWP $\\le15$ mmHg, PVR $\\ge3$ Wood units is implied by \"elevated PVR\") are consistent with current hemodynamic definitions of pre-capillary PAH. The clinical features described are classic for a subset of patients with systemic sclerosis. There are no scientific or logical flaws, ambiguities, or missing information that would preclude a definitive application of the specified criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A rigorous solution can be derived by applying the specified criteria.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe $2013$ ACR/EULAR classification criteria for systemic sclerosis operate on a weighted scoring system. A cumulative score of $\\ge 9$ is required for a patient to be classified as having definite SSc. We will now calculate the patient's score based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Skin thickening of the fingers of both hands extending proximal to the MCP joints:** This is a sufficient criterion that, if present, automatically classifies the patient with SSc (score of $9$). The patient does **not** have this finding (\"without skin thickening extending proximal to the MCP joints\").\n    - Score: $0$\n\n2.  **Skin thickening of the fingers (only):** This item considers either puffy fingers or sclerodactyly confined to the fingers. The patient has \"mildly puffy fingers\".\n    - Puffy fingers: grants $2$ points.\n    - Sclerodactyly of the fingers: grants $4$ points.\n    As the patient is described with puffy fingers, this item contributes to the score.\n    - Score: $2$\n\n3.  **Fingertip lesions:** This includes fingertip ulcers (granting $2$ points) or fingertip pitting scars (granting $3$ points). The patient has \"no fingertip ulcers or pitting scars\".\n    - Score: $0$\n\n4.  **Telangiectasia:** The patient has \"numerous blanchable telangiectasias on the lips, face, and hands\". This is a positive finding.\n    - Score: $2$\n\n5.  **Abnormal nailfold capillaries:** The patient has findings \"consistent with a scleroderma pattern\" on nailfold capillaroscopy. This is a positive finding.\n    - Score: $2$\n\n6.  **Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and/or Interstitial lung disease (ILD):** This criterion awards points for the presence of either or both conditions. The patient's RHC confirms PAH, although the HRCT is negative for ILD. The presence of PAH is sufficient.\n    - Score: $2$\n\n7.  **Raynaud’s phenomenon:** The patient has a clear history of \"episodic triphasic color changes of the fingers consistent with Raynaud’s phenomenon\". This is a positive finding.\n    - Score: $3$\n\n8.  **SSc-related autoantibodies:** The criteria consider anticentromere, anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-$70$), and anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies. The patient's serology is negative for all three.\n    - Score: $0$\n\n**Total Score Calculation:**\nThe cumulative score is the sum of the points from each criterion:\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = (\\text{Puffy fingers}) + (\\text{Telangiectasia}) + (\\text{Abnormal nailfold capillaries}) + (\\text{PAH}) + (\\text{Raynaud's phenomenon}) $$\n$$ \\text{Total Score} = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 11 $$\n\nSince the total score of $11$ is greater than or equal to the threshold of $9$, the patient meets the $2013$ ACR/EULAR criteria for classification as having systemic sclerosis.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The patient cannot be classified as having systemic sclerosis because skin thickening proximal to the MCP joints is absent.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While skin thickening proximal to the MCP joints is a sufficient criterion (score of $9$), its absence does not preclude classification. The system is designed to classify patients with a cumulative score $\\ge 9$ from other features, as is the case here. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The patient meets classification for systemic sclerosis because the cumulative weighted score is at least $9$ from puffy fingers, Raynaud’s phenomenon, telangiectasia, abnormal nailfold capillaries, and pulmonary arterial hypertension.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the application of the criteria. The patient's score is $11$ ($11 \\ge 9$), derived from the sum of points for puffy fingers ($2$), Raynaud’s phenomenon ($3$), telangiectasia ($2$), abnormal nailfold capillaries ($2$), and PAH ($2$). This correctly summarizes the reasoning for classifying this patient. **Correct**.\n\n**C. The patient can only be classified as having systemic sclerosis if at least one systemic sclerosis–specific autoantibody is present, given the minimal skin involvement.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The presence of specific autoantibodies is a weighted item but is not a mandatory requirement for classification. A patient can meet the criteria with a score of $\\ge 9$ based entirely on clinical findings, even in the absence of the three specified antibodies. This patient is an example of such a case. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The patient requires fingertip ulcers or pitting scars to meet classification; without these lesions, the criteria are not satisfied.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Similar to autoantibodies, fingertip lesions are an optional, weighted item that contributes to the score but are not required for classification. The patient achieved a score of $11$ without any points from this category. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The patient requires interstitial lung disease to count the pulmonary item; pulmonary arterial hypertension alone does not contribute to the score.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The wording of the criterion is \"Pulmonary arterial hypertension AND/OR Interstitial lung disease\". The presence of either condition is sufficient to earn the $2$ points for this item. This patient has confirmed PAH, which provides the $2$ points. **Incorrect**.",
