Immunohistochemical (IHC) markers like S100 are invaluable tools for identifying cell lineage but are not perfectly specific. This exercise demonstrates how to move beyond a qualitative interpretation of a stain to a quantitative assessment of its diagnostic power by calculating the positive predictive value (PPV), a crucial skill for evidence-based practice.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard diagnostic statistics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated objectively. We are asked to derive an expression for the positive predictive value (PPV) from first principles and then calculate its numerical value.\n\nLet us define the relevant events and their probabilities based on the information provided in the problem statement.\nLet $C$ be the event that a patient has chondrosarcoma.\nLet $C^c$ be the event that a patient does not have chondrosarcoma.\nLet $T$ be the event that the S100 immunohistochemistry test is positive.\nLet $T^c$ be the event that the S100 test is negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following data, which we can express in probabilistic terms:\n1.  The prevalence of chondrosarcoma is $P(C) = 0.12$. This is the prior probability of the disease in the given cohort.\n2.  The probability of a patient not having chondrosarcoma is the complement of the prevalence: $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the S100 test is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient has chondrosarcoma. This is given as $P(T|C) = 0.95$.\n4.  The specificity of the S100 test is the probability of a negative test result given that the patient does not have chondrosarcoma. This is given as $P(T^c|C^c) = 0.62$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can find the probability of a false positive, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the patient does not have chondrosarcoma. This is the complement of the specificity:\n$$P(T|C^c) = 1 - P(T^c|C^c) = 1 - 0.62 = 0.38$$\n\nThe quantity we need to derive is the positive predictive value (PPV). The PPV is the probability that a patient has chondrosarcoma given that the S100 test is positive. In our notation, this is the conditional probability $P(C|T)$.\n\nAs stipulated by the problem, we will use Bayes’ theorem to find this value. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$P(C|T) = \\frac{P(T|C) P(C)}{P(T)}$$\n\nThe term $P(T)$ in the denominator is the overall probability of a positive test result, regardless of the patient's disease status. We can expand this term using the law of total probability, which allows us to express $P(T)$ in terms of the conditional probabilities related to the presence or absence of the disease:\n$$P(T) = P(T|C)P(C) + P(T|C^c)P(C^c)$$\nThe first term, $P(T|C)P(C)$, represents the probability of a true positive result (the test is positive and the patient has the disease). The second term, $P(T|C^c)P(C^c)$, represents the probability of a false positive result (the test is positive but the patient does not have the disease).\n\nSubstituting this expansion of $P(T)$ back into the expression for Bayes' theorem, we get the full formula for the PPV:\n$$P(C|T) = \\frac{P(T|C) P(C)}{P(T|C)P(C) + P(T|C^c)P(C^c)}$$\n\nThis expression for PPV, $P(C|T)$, is derived from first principles using Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability. Now we can relate its components to the standard definitions given:\n- $P(C)$ is the prevalence.\n- $P(T|C)$ is the sensitivity.\n- $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \\text{prevalence}$.\n- $P(T|C^c) = 1 - P(T^c|C^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$.\n\nSubstituting these terms, we have the derived expression for PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n- prevalence = $0.12$\n- sensitivity = $0.95$\n- specificity = $0.62$\n\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.95) \\times (0.12)}{(0.95) \\times (0.12) + (1 - 0.62) \\times (1 - 0.12)}$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = 0.95 \\times 0.12 = 0.114$$\nNext, calculate the two terms in the denominator:\n$$\\text{Term 1} = 0.95 \\times 0.12 = 0.114$$\n$$\\text{Term 2} = (1 - 0.62) \\times (1 - 0.12) = 0.38 \\times 0.88 = 0.3344$$\nThe denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\\text{Denominator} = 0.114 + 0.3344 = 0.4484$$\nFinally, we compute the PPV:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.114}{0.4484} \\approx 0.25423728813$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $5$, $4$, and $2$. The fifth significant figure is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$\\text{PPV} \\approx 0.2542$$\nThis is the positive predictive value of S100 positivity for chondrosarcoma in this specific cohort.",

The rule will be based on the maximum cartilage cap thickness measured on MRI, with a threshold for positivity defined as greater than $2\\,\\text{cm}$ in adults. Construct a scientifically realistic measurement protocol and then, using observational data, compute the malignancy risk for an adult whose cartilage cap thickness exceeds $2\\,\\text{cm}$.\n\nMeasurement protocol: Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), obtain high-resolution images of the lesion with the following parameters. Use $1.5\\,\\text{T}$ or $3\\,\\text{T}$ scanners with T$1$-weighted, T$2$-weighted fat-suppressed, and Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) sequences to visualize the cartilage cap.

Identify the slice and plane (sagittal or coronal) demonstrating the maximal cartilage cap thickness. Measure the cap thickness perpendicular to the underlying cortex using digital calipers in the picture archiving and communication system. Obtain three independent measurements by two observers (total of $6$ readings) and define the lesion’s cap thickness as the median of these $6$ measurements. Define the binary test $T$ as positive ($T=1$) if the median cap thickness is greater than $2\\,\\text{cm}$ and negative ($T=0$) otherwise. Confirm the reference diagnosis by histopathology after resection.\n\nData: In a cohort of $240$ adult patients with resected lesions and histopathology-confirmed diagnoses, there are $60$ chondrosarcomas and $180$ benign osteochondromas.

Posterior Probability using Bayes' Theorem**\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability of malignancy for a patient with a positive test, which is the conditional probability $P(D|T=1)$. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$\nP(D|T=1) = \\frac{P(T=1|D) P(D)}{P(T=1)}\n$$\n\nTo use this formula, we need three components:\n- $P(T=1|D)$: This is the sensitivity, which we calculated as $0.8$.\n- $P(D)$: This is the prior probability of having the disease, also known as the prevalence in the studied population. It is estimated from the cohort data.\n$$\nP(D) = \\frac{\\text{Total number of diseased patients}}{\\text{Total number of patients}} = \\frac{N_D}{N} = \\frac{60}{240} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\n$$\n- $P(T=1)$: This is the overall probability of a positive test. It can be calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T=1) = P(T=1|D)P(D) + P(T=1|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)\n$$\nWe need $P(\\neg D)$, the prior probability of not having the disease, and $P(T=1|\\neg D)$, the probability of a positive test given no disease.\n$$\nP(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n$$\nThe probability $P(T=1|\\neg D)$ is the complement of the specificity, $1 - P(T=0|\\neg D)$.\n$$\nP(T=1|\\neg D) = 1 - \\text{Specificity} = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n$$\nNow we can compute $P(T=1)$:\n$$\nP(T=1) = (0.8)(0.25) + (0.05)(0.75) = 0.2 + 0.0375 = 0.2375\n$$\nAlternatively, $P(T=1)$ can be calculated directly from the total number of positive tests in the cohort, which is $TP+FP = 48+9 = 57$.\n$$\nP(T=1) = \\frac{TP+FP}{N} = \\frac{57}{240} = 0.2375\n$$\nThe results are consistent.\n\nNow we can substitute these values back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(D|T=1) = \\frac{P(T=1|D) P(D)}{P(T=1)} = \\frac{(0.8)(0.25)}{0.2375} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2375}\n$$\nA more direct and intuitive way to express $P(D|T=1)$ is to consider the population of patients who tested positive. The probability is the ratio of those who truly have the disease (True Positives) to the total number who tested positive (True Positives + False Positives).\n$$\nP(D|T=1) = \\frac{\\text{Number of patients with D and T=1}}{\\text{Total number of patients with T=1}} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n$$\nUsing the given counts:\n$$\nP(D|T=1) = \\frac{48}{48 + 9} = \\frac{48}{57}\n$$\nDividing $48$ by $57$ gives a repeating decimal:\n$$\n\\frac{48}{57} = \\frac{16}{19} \\approx 0.84210526...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Pitfalls in distinguishing ACT from LGC include nonspecific pain, overlapping imaging features such as endosteal scalloping and subtle cortical breach, and sampling error due to tumor heterogeneity in biopsy specimens. To formalize these pitfalls, consider a continuous diagnostic score $s$ constructed from imaging and histologic features (higher values indicate greater aggressiveness).
