This practice challenges you to process raw pH monitoring data, a task that mirrors the analytical function of modern diagnostic software. By applying the clinical definition of acid exposure ($pH < 4$) to a series of time-stamped measurements and using linear interpolation, you will calculate the total acid exposure time and interpret its clinical significance .",

            "problem": "A 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH study is performed in a patient with suspected gastroesophageal reflux disease. Acid exposure time is defined as the fraction of the total recorded time during which the esophageal hydrogen ion concentration results in a pH reading strictly less than $4$; time at exactly $4$ is not counted as acid exposure. Widely accepted reference ranges for the total acid exposure time fraction are: normal if less than $0.04$, inconclusive if between $0.04$ and $0.06$, and pathological if greater than $0.06$. The recording provides the following sequence of time-stamped esophageal pH values, from start at $t=0$ hours to the end of monitoring at $t=24$ hours. Between each pair of time stamps, assume the pH changes linearly with time.\n\nThe data are:\n- At $t = 0.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.5$.\n- At $t = 1.2$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$.\n- At $t = 2.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.5$.\n- At $t = 2.5$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.2$.\n- At $t = 3.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.2$.\n- At $t = 5.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 5.5$.\n- At $t = 8.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 2.5$.\n- At $t = 8.4$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.8$.\n- At $t = 9.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.5$.\n- At $t = 12.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.1$.\n- At $t = 12.3$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.9$.\n- At $t = 13.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.0$.\n- At $t = 13.4$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.3$.\n- At $t = 18.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.2$.\n- At $t = 19.5$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.5$.\n- At $t = 20.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 3.5$.\n- At $t = 21.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 4.0$.\n- At $t = 22.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.0$.\n- At $t = 24.0$ hours, $\\mathrm{pH} = 6.5$.\n\nStarting from the core definition of acid exposure time and the assumption of linear interpolation between the given points, determine the total acid exposure time fraction over the $24$-hour study. Then, using the reference ranges, determine whether the study is normal, inconclusive, or pathological based on the computed fraction. Express only the acid exposure time fraction as a unitless decimal in your final answer, rounded to four significant figures.

We assume a linear change in pH between measurements.\n\nThe total duration of the study is $T_{\\text{total}} = 24$ hours. Acid exposure is defined as the time during which $pH < 4$. Let this threshold pH be denoted $P_{th} = 4$. For any time interval between two consecutive data points, $(t_i, p_i)$ and $(t_{i+1}, p_{i+1})$, we analyze the pH values at the endpoints.\n\n1.  If both $p_i \\geq 4$ and $p_{i+1} \\geq 4$, the acid exposure time in this interval is $0$.\n2.  If both $p_i < 4$ and $p_{i+1} < 4$, the acid exposure time is the full duration of the interval, $t_{i+1} - t_i$.\n3.  If the pH crosses the threshold $P_{th}=4$ within the interval, we calculate the precise time of crossing, $t_c$, using linear interpolation:\n    $$t_c = t_i + (P_{th} - p_i) \\frac{t_{i+1} - t_i}{p_{i+1} - p_i}$$\n    The duration of acid exposure is then calculated based on whether the pH is rising or falling through the threshold.\n\nLet's calculate the acid exposure duration for each relevant interval (all units of time are in hours):\n- Interval $[1.2, 2.0]$: $p(1.2)=6.0$, $p(2.0)=3.5$.

Both below $4$. Duration $= 13.0 - 12.3 = 0.7$.\n- Interval $[13.0, 13.4]$: $p(13.0)=3.0$, $p(13.4)=4.3$. Crossing from below to above $4$.\n  $t_c = 13.0 + (4 - 3.0) \\frac{13.4 - 13.0}{4.3 - 3.0} = 13.0 + \\frac{0.4}{1.3}$. Duration $= t_c - 13.0 = \\frac{4}{13}$.\n- Interval $[18.0, 19.5]$: $p(18.0)=6.2$, $p(19.5)=3.5$. Crossing from above to below $4$.\n  $t_c = 18.0 + (4 - 6.2) \\frac{19.5 - 18.0}{3.5 - 6.2} = 18.0 + \\frac{11}{9}$.

Duration $= 1.0$.\n\nAll other intervals have pH values at or above $4$ at both endpoints, so their acid exposure time is $0$. The total acid exposure time, $AET_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of these durations:\n$$AET_{\\text{total}} = 0.16 + 0.5 + 0.4 + 1.5 + 0.4 + \\frac{1.2}{7} + 0.15 + 0.7 + \\frac{4}{13} + \\frac{5}{18} + 0.5 + 1.0$$\n$$AET_{\\text{total}} \\approx 5.31 + 0.17143 + 0.30769 + 0.27778 \\approx 6.0669 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe acid exposure time fraction $F$ is $\\frac{AET_{\\text{total}}}{T_{\\text{total}}}$:\n$$F = \\frac{6.0669}{24} \\approx 0.2527875$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $F \\approx 0.2528$.\nAccording to the provided reference ranges, a fraction greater than $0.06$ is considered pathological. Since $0.2528 > 0.06$, the study result is pathological.",
