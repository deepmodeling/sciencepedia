            "solution": "The problem requires deducing the relationship between circumferential wall tension ($T$), intraluminal pressure ($P$), and radius ($R$) for a thin-walled cylinder. This relationship is a form of the Law of Laplace.\n\nConsider a segment of the thin-walled cylinder of length $L$ and inner radius $R$. An internal pressure $P$ acts perpendicularly on the inner surface. To find the circumferential tension (also known as hoop tension), we imagine cutting the cylinder in half longitudinally. We can now analyze the equilibrium of forces on one of the halves.\n\nThe force exerted by the internal pressure, $F_P$, pushes the two halves apart. This force acts on the projected rectangular area of the cut surface, which has dimensions $2R \\times L$.\nThe magnitude of this pressure-induced force is given by:\n$$\nF_P = P \\times (\\text{Area}) = P \\times (2RL)\n$$\nThis outward force must be balanced by the tension within the cylinder wall. The circumferential wall tension, $T$, is defined as the force per unit length along the axis of the cylinder. This tension acts on the two cut edges of the wall. Each cut edge has a length $L$.\nThe total restoring force from the tension in the wall, $F_T$, is therefore:\n$$\nF_T = T \\times (2L)\n$$\nFor the cylinder to be in mechanical equilibrium, the outward force due to pressure must be equal to the inward restoring force due to tension:\n$$\nF_P = F_T\n$$\n$$\nP(2RL) = T(2L)\n$$\nDividing both sides by $2L$ (assuming $L \\neq 0$), we obtain the relationship for circumferential tension:\n$$\nT = PR\n$$\nThe units of tension $T$ are consistent with the required output.

            "introduction": "While increased pressure is key, the story of diverticular disease has a crucial anatomical component: its predilection for the sigmoid colon. This practice challenges you to move beyond simple tension and consider wall stress, which incorporates radius, pressure, and wall thickness. By comparing the mechanical stresses in the sigmoid colon and the cecum under both baseline and peak pressure conditions, you will uncover why the dynamics of segmental contraction in the sigmoid create the 'perfect storm' for mucosal herniation .",

            "problem": "An investigator models two colonic segments as thin-walled cylindrical shells to understand the distribution of diverticula. The cecum has a larger lumen but lower intraluminal pressures; the sigmoid colon has a smaller lumen but experiences higher, transient segmental pressures. Assume the following representative measurements under physiologic conditions:\n\n- Cecum: radius $r_c = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, wall thickness $t_c = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$; baseline pressure $P_{c,0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ with transient peaks $P_{c,\\mathrm{peak}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- Sigmoid colon: radius $r_s = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, wall thickness $t_s = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (left-sided muscular hypertrophy); baseline pressure $P_{s,0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ with transient peaks $P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ during segmentation.\n\nUsing first principles and the dependence of circumferential wall stress on intraluminal pressure, radius, and wall thickness for thin-walled cylinders, reason which statement best explains why diverticula arise predominantly in the sigmoid rather than the cecum. Consider both baseline and peak conditions and the presence of focal weak points where penetrating vessels traverse the muscular layer.\n\nA. The sigmoid colon’s higher transient intraluminal pressures (e.g., $P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) more than offset its smaller radius and greater thickness, producing higher peak circumferential wall stress than in the cecum; repeated stress spikes at focal weak points favor mucosal herniation in the sigmoid. A quantitative comparison yields a sigmoid-to-cecum peak stress ratio of approximately $1.8$, even though the baseline ratio is below $1$.\n\nB. The cecum’s larger radius ($r_c = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) guarantees the highest wall stress regardless of pressure or thickness, so diverticula should preferentially form in the cecum.\n\nC. Increased wall thickness in the sigmoid ($t_s = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) completely negates any effect of higher intraluminal pressure, equalizing circumferential wall stress throughout the colon; thus distribution is unrelated to mechanics.\n\nD. Because smaller radius reduces stress in a cylindrical wall more strongly than pressure can increase it, the sigmoid’s stress remains lower than the cecum’s under both baseline and peak conditions; therefore the sigmoid is protected despite its segmentation pressures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of circumferential wall stress in two segments of the colon, the cecum and the sigmoid, modeled as thin-walled cylindrical shells. The governing principle is the Law of Laplace for a thin-walled cylinder, which relates the circumferential stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta}$, to the intraluminal pressure, $P$, the lumen radius, $r$, and the wall thickness, $t$. The formula is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{Pr}{t} $$\nThe analysis will determine which colonic segment experiences higher wall stress, particularly under conditions of transient pressure elevation, to explain the predilection for diverticula formation in the sigmoid colon.\n\nFirst, we organize the given parameters. To ensure consistency in calculations, we will convert all length measurements to millimeters ($mm$).\n\n**Given Parameters:**\n\n**Cecum ($c$):**\n- Radius: $r_c = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Wall thickness: $t_c = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Baseline pressure: $P_{c,0} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Peak pressure: $P_{c,\\mathrm{peak}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\n**Sigmoid Colon ($s$):**\n- Radius: $r_s = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Wall thickness: $t_s = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n- Baseline pressure: $P_{s,0} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n- Peak pressure: $P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$\n\nThe problem statement posits that the formation of diverticula, which are herniations of the mucosal layer through the muscular wall, is driven by high wall stress, especially at focal points of weakness. We will now calculate the circumferential wall stress for both segments under both baseline and peak pressure conditions. The units of the calculated stress will be proportional to $\\mathrm{mmHg} \\cdot \\mathrm{mm} / \\mathrm{mm}$, which provides a consistent basis for comparison.\n\n**1. Baseline Condition Analysis:**\n\n- **Cecum Baseline Stress ($\\sigma_{c,0}$):**\n$$ \\sigma_{c,0} = \\frac{P_{c,0} r_c}{t_c} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})(40\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{2\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 200 \\text{ (relative units)} $$\n\n- **Sigmoid Baseline Stress ($\\sigma_{s,0}$):**\n$$ \\sigma_{s,0} = \\frac{P_{s,0} r_s}{t_s} = \\frac{(20\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})(20\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{3\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{400}{3} \\approx 133.3 \\text{ (relative units)} $$\n\nAt baseline, the stress in the cecum is greater than in the sigmoid: $\\sigma_{c,0} > \\sigma_{s,0}$. The ratio of sigmoid-to-cecum baseline stress is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{s,0}}{\\sigma_{c,0}} = \\frac{400/3}{200} = \\frac{400}{600} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.67 $$\nThis ratio is less than $1$.\n\n**2. Peak Condition Analysis:**\n\n- **Cecum Peak Stress ($\\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}}$):**\n$$ \\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{P_{c,\\mathrm{peak}} r_c}{t_c} = \\frac{(15\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})(40\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{2\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = 300 \\text{ (relative units)} $$\n\n- **Sigmoid Peak Stress ($\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}}$):**\n$$ \\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\frac{P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} r_s}{t_s} = \\frac{(80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg})(20\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{3\\,\\mathrm{mm}} = \\frac{1600}{3} \\approx 533.3 \\text{ (relative units)} $$\n\nUnder peak pressure conditions, the stress relationship inverts: the stress in the sigmoid colon is substantially greater than in the cecum: $\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} > \\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}}$. The large, transient increase in intraluminal pressure in the sigmoid during segmentation is the dominant factor, overwhelming the counteracting effects of its smaller radius and thicker wall.\n\nThe ratio of sigmoid-to-cecum peak stress is:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}}}{\\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}}} = \\frac{1600/3}{300} = \\frac{1600}{900} = \\frac{16}{9} \\approx 1.778 $$\nThis ratio is approximately $1.8$. The repeated episodes of high peak stress in the sigmoid provide the mechanical force necessary to cause herniation of the mucosa through the muscularis, particularly at inherent weak points where blood vessels penetrate the colonic wall. This explains the higher incidence of diverticula in the sigmoid colon.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. The sigmoid colon’s higher transient intraluminal pressures (e.g., $P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) more than offset its smaller radius and greater thickness, producing higher peak circumferential wall stress than in the cecum; repeated stress spikes at focal weak points favor mucosal herniation in the sigmoid. A quantitative comparison yields a sigmoid-to-cecum peak stress ratio of approximately $1.8$, even though the baseline ratio is below $1$.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement aligns perfectly with our calculations and reasoning. It correctly identifies that the high transient pressure in the sigmoid leads to a higher peak wall stress ($\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} > \\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}}$). It correctly states the pathophysiological mechanism of herniation due to repeated stress spikes. It correctly quantifies the peak stress ratio as approximately $1.8$ (our calculation is $\\approx 1.78$). Finally, it correctly notes that the baseline stress ratio is less than $1$ (our calculation is $\\approx 0.67$).\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The cecum’s larger radius ($r_c = 4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$) guarantees the highest wall stress regardless of pressure or thickness, so diverticula should preferentially form in the cecum.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement is incorrect. While a larger radius contributes to higher stress, it does not \"guarantee\" the highest stress under all conditions. The formula $\\sigma_{\\theta} = Pr/t$ shows that stress also depends on pressure $P$ and thickness $t$. Our calculation for peak conditions explicitly refutes this claim, as $\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} > \\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}}$.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Increased wall thickness in the sigmoid ($t_s = 3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) completely negates any effect of higher intraluminal pressure, equalizing circumferential wall stress throughout the colon; thus distribution is unrelated to mechanics.**\n- **Evaluation:** This claim is false. Our calculations show that stresses are not equalized under either baseline or peak conditions. The increased thickness of the sigmoid wall is not sufficient to \"completely negate\" the extremely high transient pressures. The conclusion that the distribution is \"unrelated to mechanics\" is contrary to the fundamental biophysical explanation for diverticulosis.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Because smaller radius reduces stress in a cylindrical wall more strongly than pressure can increase it, the sigmoid’s stress remains lower than the cecum’s under both baseline and peak conditions; therefore the sigmoid is protected despite its segmentation pressures.**\n- **Evaluation:** This statement makes a false generalization. The relative effects of radius and pressure depend on their specific values and magnitudes of change. Our calculations demonstrate that for peak conditions in the sigmoid, the effect of the high pressure ($P_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) is dominant. The conclusion that the sigmoid's stress \"remains lower than the cecum's under... peak conditions\" is factually incorrect, as our analysis shows $\\sigma_{s,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 533.3$ is much greater than $\\sigma_{c,\\mathrm{peak}} = 300$.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
