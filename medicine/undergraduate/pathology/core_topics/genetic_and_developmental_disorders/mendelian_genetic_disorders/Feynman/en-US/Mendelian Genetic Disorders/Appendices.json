            "introduction": "Understanding the prevalence of a genetic disorder within a population is a cornerstone of public health and genetics. The Hardy-Weinberg principle provides a powerful mathematical model to estimate the frequency of heterozygous carriers for autosomal recessive conditions, using only the observable incidence of the disease. This exercise  will guide you through calculating the carrier frequency for Phenylketonuria (PKU), a classic example that illustrates how we can infer the frequency of hidden alleles in a population.",

            "problem": "Phenylketonuria is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. In a large population where random mating occurs and there is no net effect of selection, mutation, migration, or genetic drift, the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) predicts genotype frequencies from allele frequencies. In a population in which the incidence of affected individuals is reported as $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{10000}$, infer the expected proportion of heterozygous carriers under HWE. Express your final carrier frequency as a decimal fraction and round to four significant figures.\n\nIn addition, briefly identify biological circumstances under which the HWE assumptions would not hold for phenylketonuria, but note that only the carrier frequency should be reported as the final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "The appropriate foundational framework is the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), which states that in an idealized population with random mating and no selection, mutation, migration, or genetic drift, the allele frequencies remain constant and genotype frequencies are given by $p^{2}$ for the homozygous normal genotype, $2pq$ for heterozygotes, and $q^{2}$ for homozygous affected individuals, where $p$ and $q$ are the frequencies of the normal and mutant alleles, respectively, and satisfy $p + q = 1$.\n\nGiven the observed incidence of phenylketonuria in the population as $q^{2} = \\frac{1}{10000}$, we first solve for $q$:\n\n$$\nq = \\sqrt{q^{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10000}} = \\frac{1}{100} = 10^{-2} = 0.01.\n$$\n\nNext, we determine $p$ using the relationship $p + q = 1$:\n\n$$\np = 1 - q = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.\n$$\n\nUnder HWE, the expected proportion of heterozygous carriers is $2pq$:\n\n$$\n2pq = 2 \\times 0.99 \\times 0.01 = 2 \\times 0.0099 = 0.0198.\n$$\n\nRounding this decimal fraction to four significant figures yields $0.01980$.\n\nTo address the biological conditions under which the HWE assumptions may be violated for phenylketonuria, we consider each core assumption and its potential breach:\n- Non-random mating, such as consanguinity or assortative mating, alters genotype frequencies and can increase the frequency of homozygous recessive individuals; this violates random mating.\n- Selection can occur if untreated affected individuals ($q^{2}$) have reduced reproductive fitness due to neurocognitive impairment; modern newborn screening and dietary therapy may mitigate selection, but differences in access or adherence can still produce selection effects.\n- Mutation introduces new alleles each generation; although typical mutation rates are low, if the mutation rate at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus is non-negligible relative to selection, it can perturb equilibrium.\n- Migration (gene flow) can change allele frequencies if populations with different $q$ mix; this is especially relevant for populations with distinct founder effects.\n- Genetic drift affects small populations, where random fluctuations in allele frequencies can be substantial; founder effects and population bottlenecks can particularly influence phenylketonuria allele frequencies.\n\nThese factors explain where and why HWE might not strictly apply in real populations. Nevertheless, under the equilibrium assumptions, the computed carrier frequency is the heterozygote proportion $2pq$.\n\nThus, the required numerical answer, expressed as a decimal fraction and rounded to four significant figures, is $0.01980$.",

            "problem": "A family has a first child diagnosed with Phenylketonuria (PKU). Assume autosomal recessive inheritance with both parents as obligate heterozygous carriers of the same pathogenic variant in the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene, so that Mendelian segregation applies independently to each pregnancy. A subsequent newborn sibling has a negative Newborn Screening (NBS) for PKU. The NBS is a binary test for disease status (affected versus unaffected) with sensitivity $0.99$ for detecting truly affected newborns and specificity $0.995$ for returning a negative result in truly unaffected newborns. Assume that carriers (heterozygotes) are physiologically unaffected with respect to blood phenylalanine at the time of screening, so their NBS behaves identically to that of truly unaffected non-carriers.\n\nUsing only the definition of conditional probability, the law of total probability, Bayes’ theorem, and Mendelian segregation, compute the posterior probability that this newborn sibling is a heterozygous carrier given the negative NBS result and the positive family history (one affected sibling, obligate carrier parents). Express the final answer as an exact fraction. Do not use a percentage sign in your answer.",
            "solution": "The objective is to compute the posterior probability that a newborn sibling is a heterozygous carrier for Phenylketonuria (PKU), given a family history of an affected sibling (implying heterozygous parents) and a negative result on a Newborn Screening (NBS) test. We will use Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability of being a carrier with the information provided by the test result.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $G_{AA}$: The newborn's genotype is homozygous dominant (unaffected, non-carrier).\n- $G_{Aa}$: The newborn's genotype is heterozygous (unaffected, carrier).\n- $G_{aa}$: The newborn's genotype is homozygous recessive (affected with PKU).\n- $T^{-}$: The newborn receives a negative NBS test result.\n\nFirst, we establish the prior probabilities for the newborn's genotype. The problem states that both parents are obligate heterozygous carriers, which corresponds to a genetic cross of $Aa \\times Aa$. According to the principles of Mendelian segregation for an autosomal recessive trait, the prior probabilities for the genotype of any child are:\n$$P(G_{AA}) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n$$P(G_{Aa}) = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$P(G_{aa}) = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nNext, we establish the conditional probabilities of a negative test result ($T^{-}$) given each possible genotype. These are derived from the test's sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive result given the presence of the disease (genotype $G_{aa}$). It is given as $0.99$.\n$$P(\\text{positive test} | G_{aa}) = 0.99 = \\frac{99}{100}$$\nTherefore, the probability of a negative test result for an affected individual (a false negative) is:\n$$P(T^{-} | G_{aa}) = 1 - P(\\text{positive test} | G_{aa}) = 1 - \\frac{99}{100} = \\frac{1}{100}$$\n\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative result given the absence of the disease. It is given as $0.995$. The disease is absent for genotypes $G_{AA}$ and $G_{Aa}$. The problem states that heterozygous carriers ($G_{Aa}$) are physiologically unaffected and their test results are identical to those of homozygous dominant individuals ($G_{AA}$). Thus:\n$$P(T^{-} | \\text{unaffected}) = P(T^{-} | G_{AA}) = P(T^{-} | G_{Aa}) = 0.995 = \\frac{995}{1000} = \\frac{199}{200}$$\n\nWe want to calculate the posterior probability of the newborn being a carrier given the negative test result, which is denoted as $P(G_{Aa} | T^{-})$. We use Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(G_{Aa} | T^{-}) = \\frac{P(T^{-} | G_{Aa}) P(G_{Aa})}{P(T^{-})}$$\n\nThe numerator is the product of the likelihood of a negative test in a carrier and the prior probability of being a carrier:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = P(T^{-} | G_{Aa}) P(G_{Aa}) = \\frac{199}{200} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{199}{400}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{-})$, is the total probability of a negative test result. We calculate this using the law of total probability, summing over all possible genotypes:\n$$P(T^{-}) = P(T^{-} | G_{AA}) P(G_{AA}) + P(T^{-} | G_{Aa}) P(G_{Aa}) + P(T^{-} | G_{aa}) P(G_{aa})$$\nSubstituting the values we have derived:\n$$P(T^{-}) = \\left(\\frac{199}{200} \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{199}{200} \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{100} \\times \\frac{1}{4}\\right)$$\n$$P(T^{-}) = \\frac{199}{800} + \\frac{199}{400} + \\frac{1}{400}$$\n$$P(T^{-}) = \\frac{199}{800} + \\frac{2 \\times 199}{800} + \\frac{2}{800}$$\n$$P(T^{-}) = \\frac{199 + 398 + 2}{800} = \\frac{599}{800}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into Bayes' theorem to find the posterior probability:\n$$P(G_{Aa} | T^{-}) = \\frac{\\frac{199}{400}}{\\frac{599}{800}}$$\n$$P(G_{Aa} | T^{-}) = \\frac{199}{400} \\times \\frac{800}{599}$$\n$$P(G_{Aa} | T^{-}) = \\frac{199 \\times 2}{599} = \\frac{398}{599}$$\nThe numbers $199$ and $599$ are prime, so this fraction is in its simplest form.",

Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder; phenotypically unaffected carriers have one pathogenic CFTR allele.

The panel includes the most prevalent pathogenic CFTR variants seen in this population and is designed such that:\n- The panel’s variant content covers a fraction $f_{c} = 0.85$ of all pathogenic CFTR alleles circulating in this population.\n- The assay’s analytic sensitivity for variants that are on the panel is $s_{a} = 0.99$ (that is, if a covered pathogenic variant is present, the probability the assay calls it is $0.99$).\n- For individuals without any pathogenic CFTR variants (true non-carriers), the overall probability of at least one false positive call is $p_{fp} = 0.001$.\n- The test is called “positive” if any panel pathogenic variant is detected; otherwise it is called “negative.”\n\nUsing only the definitions of sensitivity and specificity for a binary test, the basic rules of probability, and Bayes’ theorem as your fundamental base, do the following for this population:\n1) Derive the test’s clinical sensitivity for detecting carriers and its specificity for non-carriers from the above design features.\n2) Derive the residual probability that an individual is a carrier given a negative test result.\n\nExpress all numerical answers as decimals (not percentages) and round to four significant figures.
