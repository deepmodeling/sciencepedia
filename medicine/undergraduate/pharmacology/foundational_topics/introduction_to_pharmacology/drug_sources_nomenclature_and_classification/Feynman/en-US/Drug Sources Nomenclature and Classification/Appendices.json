            "introduction": "In pharmacology, the active form of a drug is often the 'free base' or 'free acid,' but for reasons of stability or solubility, it is frequently formulated as a salt. It is therefore crucial to distinguish between the mass of the administered salt and the mass of the active moiety it contains. This practice will guide you through the essential stoichiometric calculation required to determine the base-equivalent dose from a given salt dose, a fundamental skill for comparing drug products and ensuring therapeutic equivalence.",

            "problem": "A weakly basic drug forms a simple 1:1 hydrochloride salt with hydrogen chloride (HCl). In drug nomenclature, the salt form is labeled with the suffix “hydrochloride,” while the underlying neutral molecule is referred to as the “free base.” For dose equivalence between salt and base, the chemically relevant fundamental base is the stoichiometric relationship between moles and mass via molecular weight, and the observation that a 1:1 salt contains one mole of base per mole of salt. The molecular weight is defined as the mass per mole, and the number of moles is obtained by dividing the mass by the molecular weight. \n\nConsider a monoprotic base with molecular weight $M_{b} = 300~\\mathrm{g/mol}$ and its corresponding hydrochloride salt with molecular weight $M_{s} = 336~\\mathrm{g/mol}$. A patient receives a $50~\\mathrm{mg}$ dose of the hydrochloride salt. Assuming exact 1:1 stoichiometry between base and salt, and no water of crystallization or other counterions, compute the base-equivalent dose (the mass of the free base contained in the administered salt dose). Round your final answer to four significant figures and express it in mg.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of chemistry, specifically stoichiometry and the mole concept. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The given values are realistic and internally consistent.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of moles in a chemical structure. The problem states that the drug is a $1:1$ hydrochloride salt, meaning that one mole of the salt compound contains exactly one mole of the free base molecule and one mole of hydrogen chloride.\n\nLet $n_s$ be the number of moles of the hydrochloride salt and $n_b$ be the number of moles of the free base. Due to the specified $1:1$ stoichiometry, the number of moles of the salt administered is equal to the number of moles of the free base contained within that dose.\n$$n_s = n_b$$\nThe number of moles, $n$, of a substance is defined as its mass, $m$, divided by its molecular weight, $M$.\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\nWe can express the number of moles for the salt and the base using this relationship. Let $m_s$ be the mass of the salt, $M_s$ be the molecular weight of the salt, $m_b$ be the mass of the base, and $M_b$ be the molecular weight of the base.\n$$n_s = \\frac{m_s}{M_s}$$\n$$n_b = \\frac{m_b}{M_b}$$\nBy substituting these expressions into our molar equality, we get:\n$$\\frac{m_s}{M_s} = \\frac{m_b}{M_b}$$\nThe problem asks for the base-equivalent dose, which is the mass of the free base, $m_b$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $m_b$:\n$$m_b = m_s \\times \\frac{M_b}{M_s}$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{M_b}{M_s}$ is a dimensionless quantity often referred to as the salt factor, which converts a mass of the salt form to the equivalent mass of the free base.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nMass of the hydrochloride salt, $m_s = 50~\\mathrm{mg}$.\nMolecular weight of the free base, $M_b = 300~\\mathrm{g/mol}$.\nMolecular weight of the hydrochloride salt, $M_s = 336~\\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n\nNow we substitute these values into the equation for $m_b$. The units of molecular weight (g/mol) cancel, so the resulting unit for $m_b$ will be the same as that for $m_s$ (mg), which is consistent with the problem's requirement.\n$$m_b = 50~\\mathrm{mg} \\times \\frac{300}{336}$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$m_b = 50 \\times \\frac{75}{84} = 50 \\times \\frac{25}{28}$$\n$$m_b = \\frac{1250}{28} = \\frac{625}{14}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$m_b \\approx 44.64285714~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $4$, $6$, $4$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\n$$m_b \\approx 44.64~\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThus, the base-equivalent dose is $44.64$ mg.",

            "introduction": "For an orally administered drug to be absorbed into the bloodstream, it must first dissolve in the fluids of the gastrointestinal tract. The Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) uses solubility as a key parameter to predict a drug's absorption profile.

            "problem": "A new orally administered isoquinoline alkaloid candidate harvested from a cultivated plant source is proposed for development. Its tentative International Nonproprietary Name (INN) ends with the suffix “-ine,” reflecting its amine-based alkaloidal nature, but nomenclature and source do not alter its biopharmaceutic behavior. The highest dose strength is $D = 500~\\mathrm{mg}$, and its equilibrium intrinsic solubility across the pH range of 1 to 6.8 at physiological temperature is $S = 2~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS), is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part analysis to determine the BCS class of a new drug candidate. We are given the following data:\n- Highest dose strength, $D = 500~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Equilibrium intrinsic solubility, $S = 2~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n- Human intestinal effective permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n- Effective permeability of the high-permeability reference, metoprolol, $P_{\\mathrm{eff,Met}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in steps as outlined in the problem.\n\nFirst, we compute the minimum volume of aqueous media, $V$, required to dissolve the highest dose strength. The formula is given as $V = \\frac{D}{S}$.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nV = \\frac{D}{S} = \\frac{500~\\mathrm{mg}}{2~\\mathrm{mg/mL}} = 250~\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThe volume required to dissolve the highest dose is exactly $250~\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the solubility classification. According to the BCS guidelines, a drug substance is considered highly soluble when the highest dose strength is soluble in $250~\\mathrm{mL}$ or less of aqueous media over the pH range of 1 to 6.8. This criterion can be expressed as $V \\leq 250~\\mathrm{mL}$.\nOur calculated volume is $V = 250~\\mathrm{mL}$. We test the inequality:\n$$\n250~\\mathrm{mL} \\leq 250~\\mathrm{mL}\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied. Therefore, the drug is classified as having **high solubility**.\n\nThird, we determine the permeability classification. A drug substance is considered highly permeable when the extent of intestinal absorption is determined to be $\\geq 90\\%$ of an administered dose. In vitro, this is often assessed by comparing the drug's effective permeability ($P_{\\mathrm{eff}}$) to that of a well-characterized high-permeability reference compound. Here, metoprolol is the reference. The drug is considered highly permeable if its $P_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is greater than or equal to the $P_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the reference.\nThe given permeabilities are:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s}\n$$\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{eff,Met}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s}\n$$\nWe compare the two values:\n$$\n1.1 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s} \\geq 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{cm/s}\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the drug is classified as having **high permeability**.\n\nFourth, we assign the BCS class based on the solubility and permeability classifications. The BCS framework is defined as follows:\n-   **Class I**: High Solubility, High Permeability\n-   **Class II**: Low Solubility, High Permeability\n-   **Class III**: High Solubility, Low Permeability\n-   **Class IV**: Low Solubility, Low Permeability\n\nOur drug candidate has been determined to have **High Solubility** and **High Permeability**. Consequently, it is assigned to **BCS Class I**.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the value of $V$ in $\\mathrm{mL}$ and the BCS class as an integer from $1$ to $4$.\nThe calculated volume is $V = 250$.\nThe assigned BCS class is Class I, which corresponds to the integer $1$.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 250 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
