            "problem": "A patient aged $37$ years presents to the emergency department $2$ hours after ingesting an unknown quantity of household rubbing alcohol labeled as $70\\%$ isopropyl alcohol. He is drowsy but arousable, with blood pressure $118/72$ mmHg, heart rate $92$ beats per minute, respiratory rate $16$ breaths per minute, temperature $36.8$ degrees Celsius, and oxygen saturation $98\\%$ on room air. A point-of-care glucose is $92$ mg/dL. The physical examination notes a mild fruity odor on the breath. Initial laboratory data are as follows: sodium $140$ mEq/L, chloride $104$ mEq/L, bicarbonate $24$ mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen $14$ mg/dL, glucose $90$ mg/dL, measured serum osmolality $330$ mOsm/kg, serum ethanol $0$ mg/dL, and a qualitative serum ketone assay reported as positive. Arterial blood gas (ABG) reveals pH $7.40$, partial pressure of carbon dioxide $40$ mmHg, and bicarbonate $24$ mEq/L. A quantitative serum isopropanol level measured shortly after arrival is $120$ mg/dL. Renal function and lactate are within normal limits.\n\nUsing foundational definitions, compute the osmolar gap and the anion gap, and interpret the acid–base status. Then, based on the mechanism of toxicity and metabolism, decide between supportive care and hemodialysis as the initial management strategy. Finally, predict the expected timing and trajectory of serum acetone appearance after isopropanol ingestion.\n\nWhich option best justifies a supportive care approach over hemodialysis in this patient and most accurately predicts the serum acetone profile?\n\nA. Choose supportive care with airway protection as needed, intravenous fluids, and monitoring; hemodialysis is not indicated in a hemodynamically stable patient without metabolic acidosis or end-organ failure at an isopropanol level of $120$ mg/dL. Serum acetone will rise over the next $2$ to $6$ hours as isopropanol is metabolized and will persist for $24$ to $48$ hours due to a longer half-life than isopropanol, producing ketosis without acidosis.\n\nB. Initiate emergent hemodialysis because any osmolar gap greater than $20$ mOsm/kg mandates dialysis; acetone will be rapidly removed and should disappear within $1$ hour of dialysis initiation.\n\nC. Administer fomepizole to block alcohol dehydrogenase and prevent formation of a toxic acid metabolite, then arrange hemodialysis; acetone will not appear because isopropanol is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.\n\nD. Treat with sodium bicarbonate for an expected high anion gap metabolic acidosis and consider hemodialysis if pH falls below $7.20$; acetone will appear only if ethanol was co-ingested, otherwise isopropanol does not generate ketones.\n\nE. Perform hemodialysis because the serum isopropanol level of $120$ mg/dL exceeds the safe threshold of $50$ mg/dL; acetone concentration will peak immediately after ingestion and then decline as the osmolar gap increases.",
            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated first by extracting the given information and assessing its scientific validity and internal consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: $37$ years old male.\n- Ingestion: Unknown quantity of $70\\%$ isopropyl alcohol, $2$ hours prior to presentation.\n- Clinical Presentation: Drowsy but arousable.\n- Vital Signs: Blood pressure $118/72$ mmHg, heart rate $92$ beats per minute, respiratory rate $16$ breaths per minute, temperature $36.8$ degrees Celsius, oxygen saturation $98\\%$ on room air.\n- Point-of-care glucose: $92$ mg/dL.\n- Physical Examination: Mild fruity odor on breath.\n- Laboratory Data:\n  - Sodium ($[\\text{Na}^+]$): $140$ mEq/L\n  - Chloride ($[\\text{Cl}^-]$): $104$ mEq/L\n  - Bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$): $24$ mEq/L\n  - Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN): $14$ mg/dL\n  - Glucose: $90$ mg/dL\n  - Measured serum osmolality ($O_{meas}$): $330$ mOsm/kg\n  - Serum ethanol: $0$ mg/dL\n  - Qualitative serum ketone assay: positive\n  - Serum isopropanol level: $120$ mg/dL\n- Arterial Blood Gas (ABG):\n  - pH: $7.40$\n  - Partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($p\\text{CO}_2$): $40$ mmHg\n  - Bicarbonate ($[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$): $24$ mEq/L (consistent with serum chemistry)\n- Other: Renal function and lactate are within normal limits.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem describes a classic clinical scenario of isopropyl alcohol poisoning. The provided data must be checked for scientific consistency.\n\n1.  **Metabolism of Isopropanol**: Isopropyl alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to acetone.\n    $$ \\text{Isopropanol} \\xrightarrow{\\text{ADH}} \\text{Acetone} $$\n    Acetone is a ketone, which accounts for the positive ketone assay and the fruity breath odor. Unlike the metabolites of methanol (formic acid) and ethylene glycol (glycolic and oxalic acids), acetone is a relatively non-toxic neutral compound that does not undergo further metabolism to an acid. Therefore, isopropanol poisoning characteristically causes ketosis *without* metabolic acidosis.\n\n2.  **Acid-Base Status and Anion Gap**: The anion gap (AG) is calculated to check for unmeasured anions.\n    $$ AG = [\\text{Na}^+] - ([\\text{Cl}^-] + [\\text{HCO}_3^-]) $$\n    $$ AG = 140 \\, \\text{mEq/L} - (104 \\, \\text{mEq/L} + 24 \\, \\text{mEq/L}) = 12 \\, \\text{mEq/L} $$\n    A normal anion gap is typically in the range of $8-16$ mEq/L. An AG of $12$ mEq/L is normal. The ABG data (pH $7.40$, $p\\text{CO}_2$ $40$ mmHg, $[\\text{HCO}_3^-]$ $24$ mEq/L) indicate a normal acid-base status. These findings are perfectly consistent with the known toxicology of isopropanol, which does not produce an anion gap metabolic acidosis.\n\n3.  **Osmolality and Osmolar Gap**: The osmolar gap (OG) is the difference between the measured and calculated osmolality. The calculated osmolality ($C_{osm}$) includes contributions from major solutes. The formula, incorporating the measured intoxicants, is:\n    $$ C_{osm} = (2 \\times [\\text{Na}^+]) + \\frac{[\\text{BUN}]}{2.8} + \\frac{[\\text{Glucose}]}{18} + \\frac{[\\text{Ethanol}]}{4.6} + \\frac{[\\text{Isopropanol}]}{6.0} $$\n    The divisors correspond to conversions from mg/dL to mmol/L, based on the molecular weights (e.g., for isopropanol, MW $\\approx 60.1$ g/mol).\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ C_{osm} = (2 \\times 140) + \\frac{14}{2.8} + \\frac{90}{18} + \\frac{0}{4.6} + \\frac{120}{6.0} $$\n    $$ C_{osm} = 280 + 5 + 5 + 0 + 20 = 310 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} $$\n    Now, the osmolar gap is calculated:\n    $$ OG = O_{meas} - C_{osm} = 330 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} - 310 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} = 20 \\, \\text{mOsm/kg} $$\n    A normal osmolar gap is typically $ 10-15$ mOsm/kg. An elevated OG of $20$ is expected due to the presence of the osmotically active isopropanol. The calculated contribution of isopropanol to osmolality is $20$ mOsm/kg, which perfectly accounts for the observed osmolar gap.\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. All data points align with a textbook presentation of moderate isopropyl alcohol poisoning.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceed to the solution and option analysis.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nBased on the validation analysis:\n- The patient has an elevated osmolar gap ($20$ mOsm/kg) and a normal anion gap ($12$ mEq/L), with a normal acid-base status (pH $7.40$).\n- This \"osmolar gap without an anion gap acidosis\" is the classic presentation of an isolated isopropyl alcohol ingestion. The toxicity is primarily from CNS depression by the parent compound. The metabolite, acetone, contributes to the osmolar gap and causes ketosis but not acidosis.\n- The patient is hemodynamically stable (BP $118/72$ mmHg) and not deeply comatose (drowsy but arousable). Renal function is normal.\n- Indications for hemodialysis in toxic alcohol poisoning generally include severe, refractory metabolic acidosis (pH $ 7.25-7.30$), end-organ damage (e.g., renal failure, visual changes with methanol), hemodynamic instability, or extremely high alcohol levels with severe CNS depression. None of these criteria are met. The isopropanol level of $120$ mg/dL is not, by itself, an absolute indication for dialysis in a stable patient. Therefore, the appropriate management is supportive care.\n- The pharmacokinetics involve the conversion of isopropanol to acetone. Isopropanol has a half-life of approximately $3-8$ hours. Acetone has a much longer half-life of $17-27$ hours. Since the patient presented $2$ hours post-ingestion, the isopropanol level is likely near its peak. As it is metabolized, the acetone level will rise, peaking several hours later, and will persist in the blood for a prolonged period (e.g., $24-48$ hours) after the isopropanol has been eliminated.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Choose supportive care with airway protection as needed, intravenous fluids, and monitoring; hemodialysis is not indicated in a hemodynamically stable patient without metabolic acidosis or end-organ failure at an isopropanol level of $120$ mg/dL. Serum acetone will rise over the next $2$ to $6$ hours as isopropanol is metabolized and will persist for $24$ to $48$ hours due to a longer half-life than isopropanol, producing ketosis without acidosis.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement correctly identifies supportive care as the management of choice. It accurately lists the reasons why hemodialysis is not indicated: hemodynamic stability, absence of metabolic acidosis, no end-organ failure, and a moderate isopropanol level. The prediction of the acetone profile is also correct: it will rise as isopropanol is metabolized, and it will persist for a much longer duration due to its longer half-life, causing ketosis (positive ketones) without acidosis. All parts of this statement are consistent with the principles derived above.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Initiate emergent hemodialysis because any osmolar gap greater than $20$ mOsm/kg mandates dialysis; acetone will be rapidly removed and should disappear within $1$ hour of dialysis initiation.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. An elevated osmolar gap is a diagnostic finding, not a therapeutic indication for hemodialysis. There is no such rule that an osmolar gap greater than $20$ mOsm/kg mandates dialysis. The decision is based on clinical and laboratory evidence of severe toxicity, which is absent here.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Administer fomepizole to block alcohol dehydrogenase and prevent formation of a toxic acid metabolite, then arrange hemodialysis; acetone will not appear because isopropanol is primarily excreted unchanged by the kidneys.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, fomepizole is used for methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning to prevent the formation of their toxic *acid* metabolites. The metabolite of isopropanol, acetone, is not an acid and is less toxic than the parent compound. Blocking ADH is not indicated. Second, hemodialysis is not indicated. Third, the statement that isopropanol is primarily excreted unchanged is false; it is significantly metabolized to acetone.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Treat with sodium bicarbonate for an expected high anion gap metabolic acidosis and consider hemodialysis if pH falls below $7.20$; acetone will appear only if ethanol was co-ingested, otherwise isopropanol does not generate ketones.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is fundamentally flawed. Isopropanol poisoning does not cause a high anion gap metabolic acidosis, so sodium bicarbonate is not needed. The patient's labs explicitly show a normal AG and pH. The claim that isopropanol does not generate ketones is false; its metabolism is the direct source of the acetone (a ketone).\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Perform hemodialysis because the serum isopropanol level of $120$ mg/dL exceeds the safe threshold of $50$ mg/dL; acetone concentration will peak immediately after ingestion and then decline as the osmolar gap increases.**\n- **Analysis:** This statement is incorrect. A serum level of $120$ mg/dL in a stable patient is not an indication for hemodialysis; the threshold of $50$ mg/dL is arbitrary and not a recognized indication. The pharmacokinetic description is wrong: acetone is a metabolite, so its concentration cannot peak immediately after ingestion but must lag behind the absorption and metabolism of the parent drug. Furthermore, as isopropanol is converted to acetone (on a mole-for-mole basis with similar molecular weight) and both are eventually cleared, the osmolar gap will decline, not increase.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "A $28$-year-old adult presents within $1$ hour after ingesting ethylene glycol. Assume a single well-mixed compartment and first-order biotransformation of parent ethylene glycol to organic acids. At time $t=0$ (hours), the following laboratory values are obtained: serum sodium $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]=140$ mEq/L, serum chloride $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]=104$ mEq/L, serum bicarbonate $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{0}=24$ mEq/L, glucose $=90$ mg/dL, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) $=14$ mg/dL, and ethanol $=0$ mg/dL. The measured serum osmolality reflects baseline tonicity plus any contribution from uncharged solutes such as ethylene glycol. The initial ethylene glycol concentration is $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0}=200$ mg/dL. The molecular weight of ethylene glycol is $62.07$ g/mol. The metabolic conversion of ethylene glycol follows first-order kinetics with rate constant $k=0.20 \\text{ h}^{-1}$, yielding nonvolatile organic acids.

Then write $[\\mathrm{EG}](t)$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0}$ and $k$.\n2. Using conservation of mass and the acid-base stoichiometry, derive an expression for $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}](t)$ given the assumption that each mole of ethylene glycol metabolized produces one mole-equivalent of acid that consumes bicarbonate.\n3. Using the definitions of osmolar gap and anion gap, derive expressions for $\\mathrm{OG}(t)$ and $\\mathrm{AG}(t)$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{EG}](t)$, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$, $[\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}]$, and $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}](t)$.

For all subsequent calculations, the more precise value will be used. Let's denote this molar concentration as $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}}$.\n\nThe metabolic conversion of ethylene glycol follows first-order kinetics, which is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{d[\\mathrm{EG}](t)}{dt} = -k[\\mathrm{EG}](t) $$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant. To find the concentration $[\\mathrm{EG}](t)$ as a function of time, we separate variables and integrate:\n$$ \\int_{[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}}}^{[\\mathrm{EG}](t)} \\frac{d[\\mathrm{EG}]'}{[\\mathrm{EG}]'} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt' $$\n$$ \\ln([\\mathrm{EG}](t)) - \\ln([\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}}) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{EG}](t)}{[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}}}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the expression for the time course of ethylene glycol concentration:\n$$ [\\mathrm{EG}](t) = [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} \\exp(-kt) $$\n\nTask 2: Derivation of $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}](t)$\n\nThe amount of ethylene glycol that has been metabolized by time $t$, denoted $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{\\text{metab}}(t)$, is the difference between the initial concentration and the concentration at time $t$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{EG}]_{\\text{metab}}(t) = [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} - [\\mathrm{EG}](t) = [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} - [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} \\exp(-kt) $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{EG}]_{\\text{metab}}(t) = [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} (1 - \\exp(-kt)) $$\nThe problem states that each mole of ethylene glycol metabolized produces one mole-equivalent of acid, which stoichiometrically consumes one mole of bicarbonate, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$.

The measured osmolality includes the baseline osmolality (approximated by $\\mathrm{Osm}_{\\text{calculated}}$) plus the contribution from any uncharged solutes. The primary uncharged solute in this case is ethylene glycol.\nWe must assume that ethylene glycol behaves as an ideal solute in plasma water, such that its contribution to osmolality (in mOsm/kg) is equal to its molar concentration (in mmol/L).

As time progresses, ethylene glycol is metabolized, and its concentration decreases exponentially. This leads to a corresponding exponential decay of the osmolar gap towards zero. Therefore, the osmolar gap is highest initially and \"normalizes\" over time.\nConversely, the anion gap, $\\mathrm{AG}(t) = \\mathrm{AG}(0) + [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} (1 - \\exp(-kt))$, increases over time. The term $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} (1 - \\exp(-kt))$ represents the cumulative concentration of acidic metabolites produced. As ethylene glycol is biotransformed, these unmeasured anions (e.g., glycolate, oxalate) accumulate in the plasma. This accumulation causes a stoichiometric consumption of bicarbonate (acidosis) and a corresponding increase in the anion gap.\nThus, the metabolism of the osmotically active parent compound (ethylene glycol) simultaneously decreases the osmolar gap while increasing the concentration of acidic metabolites, which in turn increases the anion gap and worsens the acidosis. This explains the classic toxicological pattern where an early high-osmolar-gap, normal-anion-gap state evolves into a high-anion-gap metabolic acidosis with a progressively decreasing osmolar gap.\n\nTask 6: Determination of $t_{10}$\n\nWe need to find the time $t_{10}$ at which the osmolar gap is equal to $10$ mOsm/kg.\n$$ \\mathrm{OG}(t_{10}) = 10 $$\nUsing the expression for the osmolar gap:\n$$ [\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}} \\exp(-kt_{10}) = 10 $$\nSubstituting the known values for $[\\mathrm{EG}]_{0, \\text{molar}}$ and $k$:\n$$ 32.221685... \\times \\exp(-0.20 t_{10}) = 10 $$\nTo solve for $t_{10}$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp(-0.20 t_{10}) = \\frac{10}{32.221685...} \\approx 0.310351 $$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -0.20 t_{10} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{10}{32.221685...}\\right) \\approx -1.16995 $$\nFinally, we solve for $t_{10}$:\n$$ t_{10} = \\frac{-1.16995}{-0.20} \\approx 5.84975 \\text{ hours} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ t_{10} \\approx 5.85 \\text{ hours} $$",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a realistic clinical scenario in toxicology that can be formalized and solved using fundamental principles of pharmacology and fluid dynamics. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe solution is approached by first calculating the necessary quantities for the initial bolus and then for the continuous infusion. The core principle used throughout is the relationship between the amount of a solute ($n$), its concentration ($C$), and the volume of distribution ($V$):\n$$n = C \\times V$$\nAll calculations will first be developed symbolically and then evaluated numerically.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Patient mass, $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Bicarbonate distribution volume fraction, $f_{V_d} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L/kg}$\n- Initial bicarbonate concentration, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{i} = 18\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- Target bicarbonate concentration, $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{t} = 28\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- Concentration of sodium bicarbonate solution, $C_{sol} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mEq/mL}$\n- Rate of bicarbonate concentration loss due to acidosis, $R_{acid} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L/hour}$\n- Duration of the corrective infusion, $T = 4\\,\\mathrm{hours}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's bicarbonate volume of distribution, $V_d$. This is approximated as the extracellular fluid volume.\n$$V_d = m \\times f_{V_d}$$\n$$V_d = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{L/kg} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\nNext, we determine the total amount of bicarbonate (in milliequivalents, $\\mathrm{mEq}$) required to raise the serum concentration from the initial to the target level. This is the total bicarbonate deficit, $D_{total}$.\nThe change in concentration required is $\\Delta[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]$:\n$$\\Delta[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{t} - [\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]_{i}$$\n$$\\Delta[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 28\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L} - 18\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L}$$\nThe total deficit is the concentration change multiplied by the volume of distribution:\n$$D_{total} = \\Delta[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] \\times V_d$$\n$$D_{total} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L} \\times 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L} = 175\\,\\mathrm{mEq}$$\n\n**1. Bolus Volume Calculation**\n\nThe initial bolus is intended to correct $50\\%$ of the total bicarbonate deficit immediately. The amount of bicarbonate required for the bolus, $D_{bolus}$, is:\n$$D_{bolus} = 0.50 \\times D_{total}$$\n$$D_{bolus} = 0.50 \\times 175\\,\\mathrm{mEq} = 87.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq}$$\n\nThe volume of the $8.4\\%$ sodium bicarbonate solution required for this bolus, $V_{bolus}$, is found by dividing the amount of bicarbonate needed by the concentration of the solution:\n$$V_{bolus} = \\frac{D_{bolus}}{C_{sol}}$$\n$$V_{bolus} = \\frac{87.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 87.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the bolus volume is $87.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**2. Infusion Rate Calculation**\n\nThe continuous infusion must accomplish two tasks simultaneously:\na) Deliver the remaining $50\\%$ of the bicarbonate deficit over $4\\,\\mathrm{hours}$.\nb) Neutralize the ongoing acid production, which consumes bicarbonate.\n\nThe total infusion rate, $R_{infusion}$, is the sum of the rate required for correction, $R_{correct}$, and the rate required to counteract acidosis, $R_{counteract}$.\n$$R_{infusion} = R_{correct} + R_{counteract}$$\n\na) Calculation of the correction rate, $R_{correct}$:\nThe amount of bicarbonate to be delivered for correction is the remaining $50\\%$ of the deficit, $D_{infusion}$:\n$$D_{infusion} = 0.50 \\times D_{total} = 87.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq}$$\nThis amount is to be given over a period $T = 4\\,\\mathrm{hours}$. The required rate of administration in terms of amount per hour is:\n$$\\text{Rate (amount/time)} = \\frac{D_{infusion}}{T} = \\frac{87.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq}}{4\\,\\mathrm{h}} = 21.875\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}$$\nTo find the volumetric infusion rate $R_{correct}$, we divide this by the concentration of the solution:\n$$R_{correct} = \\frac{21.875\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}}{C_{sol}} = \\frac{21.875\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 21.875\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$$\n\nb) Calculation of the counteraction rate, $R_{counteract}$:\nThe ongoing acidosis reduces the bicarbonate concentration at a rate of $R_{acid} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L/hour}$. To find the rate of bicarbonate consumption in terms of amount per hour, we multiply this concentration rate by the volume of distribution $V_d$:\n$$\\text{Rate of consumption} = R_{acid} \\times V_d$$\n$$\\text{Rate of consumption} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mEq/L/h} \\times 17.5\\,\\mathrm{L} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}$$\nThe infusion must supply bicarbonate at this same rate to neutralize the effect. The volumetric rate $R_{counteract}$ is:\n$$R_{counteract} = \\frac{17.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}}{C_{sol}} = \\frac{17.5\\,\\mathrm{mEq/h}}{1\\,\\mathrm{mEq/mL}} = 17.5\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$$\n\nc) Calculation of the total infusion rate, $R_{infusion}$:\nThe total volumetric infusion rate is the sum of the two components:\n$$R_{infusion} = R_{correct} + R_{counteract}$$\n$$R_{infusion} = 21.875\\,\\mathrm{mL/h} + 17.5\\,\\mathrm{mL/h} = 39.375\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the total infusion rate is $39.4\\,\\mathrm{mL/hour}$.\n\nThe final answers are: a bolus volume of $87.5\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ and an infusion rate of $39.4\\,\\mathrm{mL/hour}$.",
