It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics and pharmacology, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and expressed in objective, formal language. It presents a standard, solvable problem in biophysical chemistry.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, in terms of the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and subsequent calculation of its value for a competitive antagonist.\n\nLet us begin with the reversible binding reaction between a receptor $\\mathrm{R}$ and a ligand $\\mathrm{L}$ to form a complex $\\mathrm{RL}$. The dissociation of this complex is represented by the elementary reaction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RL} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{R} + \\mathrm{L}\n$$\nThe law of mass action defines the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{\\mathrm{D}}$, in terms of the molar concentrations of the species at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[\\mathrm{L}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[\\mathrm{RL}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}\n$$\nThe units of $K_{\\mathrm{D}}$ are concentration, typically Molarity ($\\mathrm{M}$).\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, for any chemical process is related to the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, and the reaction quotient, $Q$, by the fundamental thermodynamic equation:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the molar gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The reaction quotient $Q$ must be a dimensionless quantity, as the argument of a logarithm must be dimensionless. $Q$ is properly defined in terms of the activities, $a_i$, of the reactants and products. For the dissociation reaction, the thermodynamic reaction quotient is:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{R}}a_{\\mathrm{L}}}{a_{\\mathrm{RL}}}\n$$\nUnder the condition of a dilute solution, the activity coefficient of each species is approximately unity ($\\gamma_i \\approx 1$), and the activity is given by the ratio of its molar concentration $[i]$ to the standard state concentration, $C^{\\circ}$. The problem specifies $C^{\\circ} = 1~\\mathrm{M}$.\n$$\na_i \\approx \\frac{[i]}{C^{\\circ}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{([\\mathrm{R}]/C^{\\circ})([\\mathrm{L}]/C^{\\circ})}{([\\mathrm{RL}]/C^{\\circ})} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}][\\mathrm{L}]}{[\\mathrm{RL}]} \\frac{1}{C^{\\circ}}\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the system is at a minimum of Gibbs free energy, so $\\Delta G = 0$. The reaction quotient $Q$ becomes equal to the thermodynamic equilibrium constant, $K_{th}$. For the dissociation reaction:\n$$\nK_{th, diss} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{R}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}[\\mathrm{L}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{[\\mathrm{RL}]_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\frac{1}{C^{\\circ}} = \\frac{K_{\\mathrm{D}}}{C^{\\circ}}\n$$\nHere, the argument of the logarithm is clearly dimensionless, as $K_{\\mathrm{D}}$ and $C^{\\circ}$ share the same units of concentration. Any calculation of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ from an equilibrium constant must be referred to a standard state, which resolves the dimensionality.\n\nSetting $\\Delta G = 0$ and $Q = K_{th, diss}$ in the Gibbs free energy equation, we find the standard Gibbs free energy for dissociation, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{diss}$:\n$$\n0 = \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{diss} + RT \\ln K_{th, diss}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{diss} = -RT \\ln K_{th, diss} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{D}}}{C^{\\circ}}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the standard Gibbs free energy of binding. The binding process is the reverse of the dissociation process:\n$$\n\\mathrm{R} + \\mathrm{L} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{RL}\n$$\nThe standard Gibbs free energy change for a reverse reaction is the negative of the forward reaction. Therefore, the standard Gibbs free energy of binding, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{bind}$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{bind} = -\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{diss} = - \\left( -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{D}}}{C^{\\circ}}\\right) \\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_{\\mathrm{D}}}{C^{\\circ}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the standard Gibbs free energy of binding in terms of $K_{\\mathrm{D}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value.

The total receptor concentration is $[R_{tot}]$. The binding equilibria are defined by dissociation constants $K_A$ and $K_B$:\n$$ K_A = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}, \\quad K_B = \\frac{[B][R]}{[BR]} $$\nThe total receptor pool is $[R_{tot}] = [R] + [AR] + [BR]$.

The theoretical slope is exactly 1.\nWe compute the slope using finite differences between any pair of points $(x_i, y_i) = (\\ln([B]_i), \\ln(DR_i-1))$.\nFirst, calculate the dose ratios:\n- For $[B]_1=25~\\mathrm{nM}$, $DR_1 = 7.5/5 = 1.5$.\n- For $[B]_2=50~\\mathrm{nM}$, $DR_2 = 10/5 = 2.0$.\n- For $[B]_3=100~\\mathrm{nM}$, $DR_3 = 15/5 = 3.0$.\nNow, calculate the slope between points 1 and 2:\n$$ m_{12} = \\frac{\\ln(DR_2-1) - \\ln(DR_1-1)}{\\ln([B]_2) - \\ln([B]_1)} = \\frac{\\ln(2-1) - \\ln(1.5-1)}{\\ln(50) - \\ln(25)} = \\frac{\\ln(1) - \\ln(0.5)}{\\ln(50/25)} = \\frac{0 - (-\\ln(2))}{\\ln(2)} = 1 $$\nThe slope is exactly 1.\n\nThe final values for the matrix are $[7.5, 10, 15, 1]$.",
