            "problem": "A hospitalized adult is prescribed the Histamine H₂ receptor antagonist (H2RA) famotidine for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Consider a $70$ kg patient with normal renal function who receives an oral dose $D = 20$ mg every $\\tau = 12$ hours. The fraction of the drug excreted unchanged in urine under normal renal function is $f_e = 0.75$. A different patient has renal impairment with a measured Creatinine Clearance (CrCl; creatinine clearance) of $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}} = 25$ mL/min, compared to a typical normal value $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}} = 100$ mL/min. Assume oral bioavailability is constant, nonrenal clearance is unaffected by renal impairment, and volume of distribution is unchanged. Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are primarily eliminated by hepatic metabolism, unlike H₂RAs, which have prominent renal elimination.\n\nUsing only fundamental pharmacokinetic definitions and assumptions listed above (for example, clearance additivity across pathways, mass balance at steady state, and proportionality of renal drug clearance to renal function as indexed by CrCl for drugs excreted unchanged), first derive the effect of reduced CrCl on the total clearance of famotidine. Then, compute an adjusted dosing interval $\\tau'$ that maintains the same average steady-state plasma concentration as in normal renal function if the dose $D$ remains unchanged.\n\nRound your final answer for $\\tau'$ to three significant figures and express it in hours.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics and provides sufficient, consistent information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The assumptions provided are standard for such calculations and make the problem solvable. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe objective is to compute an adjusted dosing interval, $\\tau'$, for a patient with renal impairment to maintain the same average steady-state plasma concentration ($C_{ss,avg}$) as a patient with normal renal function, given that the dose ($D$) remains unchanged.\n\nThe average steady-state plasma concentration for a drug administered orally is given by the equation:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{\\text{Dosing Rate}}{\\text{Total Clearance}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D / \\tau}{CL_T}$$\nwhere $F$ is the oral bioavailability, $D$ is the dose, $\\tau$ is the dosing interval, and $CL_T$ is the total body clearance of the drug.\n\nThe condition to be met is that the average steady-state concentration in the impaired patient ($C_{ss,avg, imp}$) must equal that in the patient with normal function ($C_{ss,avg, norm}$):\n$$C_{ss,avg, imp} = C_{ss,avg, norm}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss,avg}$ for both states:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot D' / \\tau'}{CL_{T, imp}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D / \\tau}{CL_{T, norm}}$$\nThe problem states that the dose remains unchanged ($D' = D$) and assumes that bioavailability ($F$) is constant. Therefore, these terms cancel out:\n$$\\frac{1 / \\tau'}{CL_{T, imp}} = \\frac{1 / \\tau}{CL_{T, norm}}$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the new dosing interval, $\\tau'$, yields:\n$$\\tau' = \\tau \\cdot \\frac{CL_{T, norm}}{CL_{T, imp}}$$\nThis relationship shows that the dosing interval must be adjusted by a factor equal to the inverse of the ratio of total clearance in the impaired state to that in the normal state.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the effect of reduced Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) on the total clearance of famotidine. This is equivalent to finding the ratio $\\frac{CL_{T, imp}}{CL_{T, norm}}$. Total clearance ($CL_T$) is the sum of renal clearance ($CL_R$) and nonrenal clearance ($CL_{NR}$):\n$$CL_T = CL_R + CL_{NR}$$\nThe fraction of drug excreted unchanged in the urine, $f_e$, is defined as the ratio of renal clearance to total clearance:\n$$f_e = \\frac{CL_R}{CL_T}$$\nFrom this, we can express the renal and nonrenal clearances in a patient with normal function in terms of total clearance and $f_e$:\n$$CL_{R, norm} = f_e \\cdot CL_{T, norm}$$\n$$CL_{NR, norm} = CL_{T, norm} - CL_{R, norm} = (1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{T, norm}$$\nThe problem provides key assumptions about the effect of renal impairment:\n$1$. Renal clearance is directly proportional to renal function as measured by CrCl. Thus, the renal clearance in the impaired patient ($CL_{R, imp}$) can be related to the normal renal clearance ($CL_{R, norm}$):\n$$CL_{R, imp} = CL_{R, norm} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right)$$\n$2$. Nonrenal clearance is unaffected by renal impairment:\n$$CL_{NR, imp} = CL_{NR, norm}$$\nNow we can write the expression for total clearance in the impaired patient, $CL_{T, imp}$:\n$$CL_{T, imp} = CL_{R, imp} + CL_{NR, imp}$$\nSubstituting the expressions based on the assumptions:\n$$CL_{T, imp} = \\left(CL_{R, norm} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right) + CL_{NR, norm}$$\nNext, we substitute the expressions for $CL_{R, norm}$ and $CL_{NR, norm}$ in terms of $CL_{T, norm}$ and $f_e$:\n$$CL_{T, imp} = \\left((f_e \\cdot CL_{T, norm}) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right) + ((1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{T, norm})$$\nFactoring out $CL_{T, norm}$ gives the direct relationship between total clearance in the impaired and normal states:\n$$CL_{T, imp} = CL_{T, norm} \\left[ f_e \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right) + (1 - f_e) \\right]$$\nThe effect of reduced CrCl on total clearance is therefore given by the ratio:\n$$\\frac{CL_{T, imp}}{CL_{T, norm}} = f_e \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right) + (1 - f_e)$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation. Now we use this result to compute the adjusted dosing interval $\\tau'$:\n$$\\tau' = \\tau \\cdot \\frac{CL_{T, norm}}{CL_{T, imp}} = \\tau \\cdot \\frac{1}{f_e \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}}\\right) + (1 - f_e)}$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nNormal dosing interval, $\\tau = 12$ hours.\nFraction excreted unchanged, $f_e = 0.75$.\nCrCl in impaired patient, $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}} = 25$ mL/min.\nCrCl in normal patient, $\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}} = 100$ mL/min.\n\nFirst, calculate the ratio of the creatinine clearances:\n$$\\frac{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{imp}}}{\\text{CrCl}_{\\text{norm}}} = \\frac{25}{100} = 0.25$$\nNext, calculate the clearance ratio, which represents the remaining fraction of total clearance in the impaired patient:\n$$\\frac{CL_{T, imp}}{CL_{T, norm}} = (0.75 \\cdot 0.25) + (1 - 0.75) = 0.1875 + 0.25 = 0.4375$$\nFinally, calculate the adjusted dosing interval $\\tau'$:\n$$\\tau' = 12 \\text{ hours} \\cdot \\frac{1}{0.4375}$$\nTo compute this precisely, we can express $0.4375$ as a fraction: $0.4375 = \\frac{7}{16}$.\n$$\\tau' = 12 \\cdot \\frac{16}{7} = \\frac{192}{7} \\approx 27.42857 \\text{ hours}$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\tau' \\approx 27.4 \\text{ hours}$$\nThe information that Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are eliminated by hepatic metabolism serves to contrast with H₂ receptor antagonists like famotidine, highlighting why renal function is critically important for the latter's dosing but not typically for PPIs.

            "problem": "A patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease is prescribed a once-daily Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) and asks whether taking the medication at bedtime is acceptable. You are asked to justify the recommended timing and to estimate the quantitative impact of bedtime dosing on daily acid suppression. Use foundational principles of gastric physiology and pharmacology to reason from first principles: (i) gastric acid secretion by parietal cells is driven by meal-stimulated signaling (acetylcholine, gastrin, histamine), which increases the fraction of active gastric Hydrogen/Potassium adenosine triphosphatase ($\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase) pumps; (ii) PPIs are weak bases and prodrugs that require access to and activation within the acidic canaliculi of active parietal cells; activated PPI then covalently and irreversibly inactivates the pump; (iii) the pharmacokinetics of many PPIs include a short plasma half-life (e.g., $t_{1/2} \\approx 1.5$ hours), such that the window of meaningful exposure for pump inactivation is concentrated within approximately $2$ hours around the time of peak plasma concentration; (iv) Histamine H₂ receptor antagonists (H2RAs) reduce acid production by reversible competitive antagonism at the H₂ receptor and do not require pump activation to bind, which affects their optimal dosing timing differently.\n\nAssume the following physiologically plausible scenario for a typical day: the fraction of pumps that are functionally active during the breakfast period is approximately $0.7$ for about $2$ hours, while the nocturnal baseline fraction (in the absence of meal stimulation) is approximately $0.2$. Suppose the patient takes the PPI so that its effective window of activation and binding aligns with either the pre-breakfast period (administered so peak occurs just before breakfast) or with bedtime (administered so peak occurs during nocturnal baseline activity). Consider that the instantaneous rate at which pumps become irreversibly inactivated is proportional to both the local drug availability and the fraction of pumps that are active at that time, and that the overall fraction of pumps inactivated by a dose can be approximated by accumulating this effect over the short effective window. For purposes of estimating once-daily efficacy on that day, let the degree of acid suppression be directly proportional to the fraction of pumps inactivated by the dose.\n\nWhich option best captures both the mechanistic reason for the timing recommendation and a reasonable quantitative estimate of the expected loss in efficacy (expressed as percentage points of pump inactivation, and by extension daily acid suppression) when the PPI is dosed at bedtime rather than before breakfast?\n\nA. Pre-meal dosing maximizes pump engagement because more pumps are active and canaliculi are acidic; bedtime dosing misses most activated pumps.

Timing is largely inconsequential because binding is irreversible; bedtime dosing would reduce efficacy by only about $5$ percentage points.\n\nC. Bedtime dosing is superior by approximately $15$ percentage points due to nocturnal histamine-driven acid secretion; PPIs should therefore be taken at night.\n\nD. Pre-meal dosing is preferred because hepatic clearance is slower in the morning; bedtime dosing causes a $\\sim 30$ percentage-point loss mainly due to diurnal pharmacokinetics.\n\nE.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following information and principles:\n1.  **Clinical Context:** A patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease is prescribed a once-daily Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI). The question is about the optimal dosing time (pre-breakfast vs. bedtime).\n2.  **Principle (i) - Pump Activation:** Gastric acid secretion is driven by meal-stimulated signaling, which increases the fraction of active gastric Hydrogen/Potassium adenosine triphosphatase ($\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase) pumps.\n3.  **Principle (ii) - PPI Mechanism:** PPIs are weak base prodrugs that require activation in the acidic canaliculi of *active* parietal cells. The activated form then covalently and irreversibly inactivates the $\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase pump.\n4.  **Principle (iii) - PPI Pharmacokinetics (PK):** Many PPIs have a short plasma half-life ($t_{1/2} \\approx 1.5$ hours), with an effective window for pump inactivation concentrated within approximately $2$ hours around the peak plasma concentration.\n5.  **Principle (iv) - H₂RA Mechanism:** Histamine H₂ receptor antagonists (H2RAs) act via reversible competitive antagonism and do not require pump activation. This is provided for contrast.\n6.  **Quantitative Assumptions:**\n    -   The fraction of active pumps during the breakfast period is approximately $0.7$ for about $2$ hours.\n    -   The nocturnal baseline fraction of active pumps is approximately $0.2$.\n7.  **Dosing Scenarios:**\n    -   *Pre-breakfast dosing:* PPI effective window aligns with the breakfast period (high pump activity).\n    -   *Bedtime dosing:* PPI effective window aligns with the nocturnal baseline period (low pump activity).\n8.  **Modeling Framework:**\n    -   The instantaneous rate of pump inactivation is proportional to both local drug availability and the fraction of active pumps.\n    -   The total fraction of pumps inactivated by a dose is the accumulation of this effect over the effective window.\n    -   The degree of acid suppression is directly proportional to the fraction of pumps inactivated.\n9.  **Question:** Identify the option that best captures the mechanistic reason for the timing recommendation and provides a reasonable quantitative estimate of the efficacy loss (in percentage points) for bedtime vs. pre-breakfast dosing.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** Yes. The principles described for PPI mechanism of action (prodrug, acid activation, requirement for active pumps, irreversible binding) and gastric physiology (meal-stimulated acid secretion) are core, established concepts in pharmacology and gastroenterology. The provided numerical values are plausible simplifications for modeling purposes.\n-   **Well-Posed:** Yes. The problem provides a clear set of principles and a simplified model. It asks for a comparison between two well-defined scenarios (dosing times) and a quantitative estimate based on the provided model. A unique, stable, and meaningful conclusion can be derived.\n-   **Objective:** Yes. The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidity flaws. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective problem that requires the application of first principles to a simplified quantitative model, which is a standard pedagogical approach in STEM fields.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the principle that PPI efficacy is state-dependent. According to principles (i) and (ii), PPIs only inactivate $\\mathrm{H}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase pumps that are actively secreting acid. The problem provides a model where the fraction of pumps inactivated, and thus the degree of acid suppression, is directly proportional to the fraction of pumps that are active during the drug's effective window.\n\nLet $I$ be the fraction of pumps inactivated by a single dose.\nLet $A$ be the fraction of pumps that are active during the PPI's effective window.\nThe problem states that $I$ is proportional to $A$. We can write this as:\n$$I = k \\cdot A$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that combines factors like drug bioavailability, access to the canaliculi, and the intrinsic potency of the activated drug. Since the dose and the drug are the same in both scenarios, we can assume $k$ is constant.\n\nWe are given two scenarios:\n1.  **Pre-breakfast dosing:** The PPI's effective window (approximately $2$ hours) coincides with the meal-stimulated period. The fraction of active pumps is $A_{breakfast} = 0.7$.\n    The resulting inactivation fraction is $I_{breakfast} = k \\cdot A_{breakfast} = k \\cdot 0.7$.\n2.  **Bedtime dosing:** The PPI's effective window coincides with the nocturnal period. The fraction of active pumps is $A_{bedtime} = 0.2$.\n    The resulting inactivation fraction is $I_{bedtime} = k \\cdot A_{bedtime} = k \\cdot 0.2$.\n\nThe relative efficacy of bedtime dosing compared to pre-breakfast dosing can be found by the ratio of their inactivation fractions:\n$$ \\frac{I_{bedtime}}{I_{breakfast}} = \\frac{k \\cdot 0.2}{k \\cdot 0.7} = \\frac{2}{7} \\approx 0.286 $$\nThis shows that bedtime dosing is only about $28.6\\%$ as effective as pre-breakfast dosing.\n\nThe question asks for the loss in efficacy expressed in \"percentage points\". This is the absolute difference: $\\Delta I = I_{breakfast} - I_{bedtime}$. To calculate this, we need to estimate the value of $k$. The options provide example numbers which we can use to check for consistency.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Pre-meal dosing maximizes pump engagement because more pumps are active and canaliculi are acidic; bedtime dosing misses most activated pumps. Estimated loss is about $30$ percentage points (e.g., morning $\\sim 50\\%$ inactivation vs bedtime $\\sim 18\\%$).**\n-   **Mechanistic Reason:** This reasoning is perfectly aligned with the provided principles. \"Maximizes pump engagement\" correctly identifies that more pumps are in the required active state during the meal-stimulated period ($A = 0.7$) compared to the nocturnal baseline ($A = 0.2$). \"Canaliculi are acidic\" is the necessary condition for the prodrug activation, which is met when pumps are active. \"Bedtime dosing misses most activated pumps\" is a correct consequence.\n-   **Quantitative Estimate:** The option gives an example: $I_{breakfast} \\approx 0.50$ (i.e., $50\\%$) and $I_{bedtime} \\approx 0.18$ (i.e., $18\\%$).\n    -   The loss in efficacy is $50\\% - 18\\% = 32$ percentage points. This is \"about $30$ percentage points,\" which is consistent with the statement.\n    -   Let's check if these numbers are consistent with our model. If $I_{breakfast} = 0.50$, then from $I_{breakfast} = k \\cdot 0.7$, we find the proportionality constant $k = 0.50 / 0.7 \\approx 0.714$.\n    -   Using this $k$, our model predicts the bedtime inactivation to be $I_{bedtime} = k \\cdot 0.2 \\approx 0.714 \\cdot 0.2 \\approx 0.143$, or $14.3\\%$.\n    -   The option's value of $18\\%$ is reasonably close to our model's prediction of $14.3\\%$. The slight difference is acceptable given the problem asks for a \"reasonable quantitative estimate\" and relies on simplified assumptions. The crucial point is that both the model and the option's numbers show a large drop in efficacy. The provided numbers are a plausible illustration of the principle.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Timing is largely inconsequential because binding is irreversible; bedtime dosing would reduce efficacy by only about $5$ percentage points.**\n-   **Mechanistic Reason:** This is fundamentally incorrect. It cites the irreversible binding but ignores the more critical, preceding step: the drug only binds to *active* pumps. If pumps are inactive, the irreversible nature of the potential binding is irrelevant. Thus, timing is highly consequential.\n-   **Quantitative Estimate:** A loss of only $5$ percentage points implies that $I_{bedtime}$ is only slightly less than $I_{breakfast}$. This contradicts our model, which shows that $I_{bedtime}$ is less than a third of $I_{breakfast}$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Bedtime dosing is superior by approximately $15$ percentage points due to nocturnal histamine-driven acid secretion; PPIs should therefore be taken at night.**\n-   **Mechanistic Reason:** This is incorrect. The problem explicitly states that the fraction of active pumps is much higher during a meal ($0.7$) than at night ($0.2$). Therefore, pre-meal dosing must be superior, not bedtime dosing. This option reverses the correct conclusion.\n-   **Quantitative Estimate:** Claiming a gain of $15$ percentage points for bedtime dosing is in direct contradiction to the model, which predicts a substantial loss.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Pre-meal dosing is preferred because hepatic clearance is slower in the morning; bedtime dosing causes a $\\sim 30$ percentage-point loss mainly due to diurnal pharmacokinetics.**\n-   **Mechanistic Reason:** This option identifies the correct preferred timing but provides the wrong primary reason. The problem's principles guide the reasoning towards the pharmacodynamic requirement for active pumps, not pharmacokinetic variations like hepatic clearance. While chronopharmacokinetics may exist, it is not the fundamental reason for PPI timing and is not mentioned in the provided principles to be used for the solution. The dominant factor is the availability of the target in its activatable state.\n-   **Quantitative Estimate:** The loss of $\\sim 30$ percentage points is numerically plausible but is attributed to the wrong mechanism.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Bedtime dosing causes an approximately $50$ percentage-point loss because pumps are essentially inactive at night ($0\\%$ active), making engagement impossible.**\n-   **Mechanistic Reason:** This reasoning is an incorrect exaggeration. The problem explicitly states that the nocturnal baseline fraction of active pumps is $A_{bedtime} = 0.2$, which is not $0\\%$. While activity is lower, it is not zero, so engagement is reduced, not impossible.\n-   **Quantitative Estimate:** A $50$ percentage-point loss, if we take the morning inactivation to be $50\\%$ (as in option A), would imply $0\\%$ inactivation at bedtime. This would only be true if $A_{bedtime} = 0$, which contradicts the given data.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that presents both the correct mechanistic reason based on the provided principles and a quantitative estimate that is consistent with a model derived from those principles.",

Since the problem states that the dose and oral bioavailability $F$ are identical across genotypes, this ratio simplifies to an inverse ratio of their systemic clearances:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{UM}}} = \\frac{(F \\times \\mathrm{Dose}) / CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{(F \\times \\mathrm{Dose}) / CL_{\\mathrm{UM}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{UM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}} $$\nSystemic clearance is governed by hepatic elimination. According to the well-stirred liver model, hepatic clearance ($CL_h$, which equals systemic clearance $CL$ in this context) is related to hepatic blood flow ($Q_h$), the unbound fraction of the drug in plasma ($f_u$), and the total hepatic intrinsic clearance ($CL_{\\mathrm{int}}$) by the following equation:\n$$ CL = CL_h = \\frac{Q_h \\times f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}}{Q_h + f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}} $$\nFirst, we must calculate the total intrinsic clearance for the PM and UM genotypes. The total intrinsic clearance is the sum of the contributions from the individual metabolic pathways, CYP2C19 and CYP3A.\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{int}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19} + CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,3\\mathrm{A}} $$\nThe reference intrinsic clearance for a CYP2C19 extensive metabolizer is $CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(EM)}} = 300\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$, and the invariant clearance for CYP3A is $CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,3\\mathrm{A}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$.\n\nFor the poor metabolizer (PM):\nThe CYP2C19-mediated intrinsic clearance is:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(PM)}} = 0.05 \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(EM)}} = 0.05 \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\nThe total intrinsic clearance for the PM genotype is:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(PM)}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(PM)}} + CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,3\\mathrm{A}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} + 100\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 115\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\n\nFor the ultrarapid metabolizer (UM):\nThe CYP2C19-mediated intrinsic clearance is:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(UM)}} = 2.5 \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(EM)}} = 2.5 \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 750\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\nThe total intrinsic clearance for the UM genotype is:\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(UM)}} = CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,2\\mathrm{C}19}^{\\mathrm{(UM)}} + CL_{\\mathrm{int},\\,3\\mathrm{A}} = 750\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} + 100\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} = 850\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the systemic clearance for each genotype using the given values for $Q_h = 90\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}}$ and $f_u = 0.05$.\n\nSystemic clearance for the PM genotype ($CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}$):\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{PM}} = \\frac{Q_h \\times f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(PM)}}}{Q_h + f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(PM)}}} = \\frac{90 \\times 0.05 \\times 115}{90 + 0.05 \\times 115} = \\frac{517.5}{90 + 5.75} = \\frac{517.5}{95.75}\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\n\nSystemic clearance for the UM genotype ($CL_{\\mathrm{UM}}$):\n$$ CL_{\\mathrm{UM}} = \\frac{Q_h \\times f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(UM)}}}{Q_h + f_u \\times CL_{\\mathrm{int}}^{\\mathrm{(UM)}}} = \\frac{90 \\times 0.05 \\times 850}{90 + 0.05 \\times 850} = \\frac{3825}{90 + 42.5} = \\frac{3825}{132.5}\\,\\mathrm{L\\,h^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the required ratio $\\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{UM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{UM}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\mathrm{UM}}}{CL_{\\mathrm{PM}}} = \\frac{3825/132.5}{517.5/95.75} = \\frac{3825}{132.5} \\times \\frac{95.75}{517.5} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{PM}}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\mathrm{UM}}} = \\frac{366243.75}{68568.75} \\approx 5.34133 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ 5.34133 \\rightarrow 5.34 $$\nThus, the fold-change in AUC for the poor metabolizer relative to the ultrarapid metabolizer is $5.34$.",
