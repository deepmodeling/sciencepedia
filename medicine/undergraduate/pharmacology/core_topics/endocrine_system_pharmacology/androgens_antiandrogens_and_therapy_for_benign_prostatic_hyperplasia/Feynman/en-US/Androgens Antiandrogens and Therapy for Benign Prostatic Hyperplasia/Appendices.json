These drugs compete with endogenous agonists like norepinephrine for binding to $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptors in prostatic smooth muscle. This practice  challenges you to apply the foundational Gaddum-Schild equation to quantify the impact of a competitive antagonist, providing a clear, mathematical picture of how these drugs work at the molecular level.",

            "problem": "A research team is characterizing competitive antagonism at the $\\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptor in human prostatic smooth muscle to understand drug effects relevant to Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH). In an organ bath experiment, the contractile agonist is norepinephrine ($A$), and a selective $\\alpha_{1}$ antagonist ($B$) is present at a fixed bath concentration. Assume all binding interactions obey the law of mass action, the agonist and antagonist compete reversibly for the same binding site (orthosteric competition), the system reaches equilibrium, and there are no spare receptors such that the effect at a given fraction of agonist-occupied receptors is the same whether or not the antagonist is present.\n\nLet $R$ denote free receptors, $AR$ and $BR$ denote agonist-bound and antagonist-bound receptors, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the antagonist is $K_{B}$, defined by $K_{B} = \\frac{[B][R]}{[BR]}$. The antagonist is applied at concentration $[B] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. The experimentally determined $K_{B}$ for this antagonist under these conditions is $K_{B} = 13\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions above and using equilibrium binding considerations for a reversible, competitive antagonist, determine the fold-shift in the norepinephrine concentration–response curve (that is, the factor by which the agonist concentration must be increased to produce the same effect at any given level of response) caused by the presence of the antagonist at $[B] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. Express your answer as a dimensionless number and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the fold-shift in an agonist's concentration–response curve caused by a competitive antagonist. This fold-shift, also known as the concentration ratio ($CR$) or dose ratio, is the factor by which the agonist concentration must be increased to elicit the same response in the presence of the antagonist as was achieved in its absence. The problem states that the effect is directly proportional to the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist, due to the assumption of no spare receptors. Therefore, we are looking for the ratio of agonist concentrations that yield the same fractional receptor occupancy.\n\nLet $[R_{T}]$ be the total concentration of $\\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic receptors.\nLet $[A]$ and $[B]$ be the concentrations of the agonist (norepinephrine) and antagonist, respectively.\nLet $K_{A}$ and $K_{B}$ be the equilibrium dissociation constants for the agonist and antagonist, respectively. These are defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$\n$$K_{B} = \\frac{[B][R]}{[BR]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[AR]$ is the concentration of agonist-bound receptors, and $[BR]$ is the concentration of antagonist-bound receptors.\n\nThe fractional occupancy of receptors by the agonist, denoted as $p_{A}$, is given by $p_{A} = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_{T}]}$.\n\nFirst, consider the case without the antagonist ($[B]=0$). The total receptor population consists of free and agonist-bound receptors:\n$$[R_{T}] = [R] + [AR]$$\nFrom the definition of $K_{A}$, we can express $[R]$ in terms of $[AR]$: $[R] = \\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A]}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $[R_{T}]$:\n$$[R_{T}] = \\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A]} + [AR] = [AR]\\left(\\frac{K_{A}}{[A]} + 1\\right) = [AR]\\left(\\frac{K_{A} + [A]}{[A]}\\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy $p_{A}$ is then:\n$$p_{A} = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_{T}]} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_{A}}$$\n\nNext, consider the case in the presence of the antagonist at a fixed concentration $[B]$. Now, the total receptor population is distributed among three states: free, agonist-bound, and antagonist-bound.\n$$[R_{T}] = [R] + [AR] + [BR]$$\nUsing the definitions of $K_{A}$ and $K_{B}$, we can express $[AR]$ and $[BR]$ in terms of $[R]$:\n$$[AR] = \\frac{[A'][R]}{K_{A}}$$\n$$[BR] = \\frac{[B][R]}{K_{B}}$$\nHere, we use $[A']$ to denote the agonist concentration required to achieve a certain effect in the presence of the antagonist.\nSubstitute these into the equation for $[R_{T}]$:\n$$[R_{T}] = [R] + \\frac{[A'][R]}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[B][R]}{K_{B}} = [R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[A']}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)$$\nTo find the fractional occupancy, we again solve for $p_{A} = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_{T}]}$. We can express $[R]$ in terms of $[AR]$ as $[R] = \\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A']}$.\n$$[R_{T}] = \\frac{K_{A}[AR]}{[A']}\\left(1 + \\frac{[A']}{K_{A}} + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right) = [AR]\\left(\\frac{K_{A}}{[A']} + 1 + \\frac{K_{A}}{[A']}\\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $p'_{A}$, in the presence of the antagonist is:\n$$p'_{A} = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_{T}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{K_{A}}{[A']}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)} = \\frac{[A']}{[A'] + K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)}$$\n\nThe fold-shift is the factor by which the agonist concentration must be increased to produce the same effect. Since effect is tied to fractional occupancy, we set $p_{A} = p'_{A}$:\n$$\\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_{A}} = \\frac{[A']}{[A'] + K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)}$$\nThis equality must hold for any level of response, which implies a direct relationship between the terms. Let's rearrange the equation:\n$$[A]\\left([A'] + K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right)\\right) = [A']([A] + K_{A})$$\n$$[A][A'] + [A]K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right) = [A'][A] + [A']K_{A}$$\n$$[A]K_{A}\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}\\right) = [A']K_{A}$$\nDividing both sides by $[A]K_{A}$ (assuming $K_A \\neq 0$ and $[A] \\neq 0$ for a non-zero response):\n$$\\frac{[A']}{[A]} = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}}$$\nThis is the celebrated Gaddum-Schild equation. The fold-shift, or concentration ratio ($CR$), is $\\frac{[A']}{[A]}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nAntagonist concentration, $[B] = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nAntagonist equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{B} = 13\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nWe can now compute the fold-shift:\n$$CR = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_{B}} = 1 + \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{13\\,\\mathrm{nM}}$$\n$$CR = 1 + \\frac{30}{13} \\approx 1 + 2.3076923...$$\n$$CR \\approx 3.3076923...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$CR \\approx 3.308$$\nThis means that in the presence of $30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ of the antagonist, the concentration of norepinephrine must be increased by a factor of approximately $3.308$ to achieve the same level of smooth muscle contraction as in the absence of the antagonist.",
