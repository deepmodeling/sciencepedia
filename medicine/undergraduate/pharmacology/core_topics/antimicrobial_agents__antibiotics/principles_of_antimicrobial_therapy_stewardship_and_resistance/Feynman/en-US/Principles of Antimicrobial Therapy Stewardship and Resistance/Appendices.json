In line with pharmacodynamic convention, treat $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ as a unitless index and express the final value as a pure number. Then, based on standard PK/PD target attainment principles for fluoroquinolones, assess whether this index meets a target of $100$ for bactericidal activity. Your final reported value must be a single number without units. If rounding is not required, report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is stated using objective, standard terminology.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a key pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) index for a concentration-dependent antimicrobial agent, the fluoroquinolone. This index is the ratio of the free, unbound drug's area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$) over a $24$-hour interval to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the target pathogen. This index is denoted as $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$.\n\nThe given values are:\nThe free area under the concentration-time curve from time $0$ to $24$ hours, $f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}$, is provided as:\n$$f\\text{AUC}_{0-24} = 120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}$$\nThe minimum inhibitory concentration, $MIC$, for the pathogen is:\n$$MIC = 0.5\\,\\text{mg/L}$$\n\nThe task is to compute the index $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$. The formula is a direct application of the definition:\n$$\\frac{f\\text{AUC}}{\\text{MIC}} = \\frac{f\\text{AUC}_{0-24}}{\\text{MIC}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values into the expression:\n$$\\frac{f\\text{AUC}}{\\text{MIC}} = \\frac{120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}}{0.5\\,\\text{mg/L}}$$\n\nBefore computing the numerical value, we analyze the dimensions of the quantities. The numerator has units of concentration multiplied by time ($[\\text{mass}] \\cdot [\\text{volume}]^{-1} \\cdot [\\text{time}]$), and the denominator has units of concentration ($[\\text{mass}] \\cdot [\\text{volume}]^{-1}$). The ratio therefore has units of time:\n$$\\frac{[\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h/L}]}{[\\text{mg/L}]} = [\\text{h}]$$\nHowever, the problem statement specifies that, by convention in this field, the index $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ is to be treated as a unitless quantity. We will adhere to this instruction.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculation:\n$$\\frac{f\\text{AUC}}{\\text{MIC}} = \\frac{120}{0.5}$$\nDividing by $0.5$ is equivalent to multiplying by $2$:\n$$\\frac{f\\text{AUC}}{\\text{MIC}} = 120 \\times 2 = 240$$\nThus, the value of the index is $240$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires an assessment of whether this value meets the target for bactericidal activity. The specified target for fluoroquinolones is an $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ ratio greater than or equal to $100$.\nLet the target value be $T = 100$.\nWe compare our calculated index to this target:\n$$240 \\ge 100$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the calculated $f\\text{AUC}/\\text{MIC}$ index of $240$ exceeds the established bactericidal target of $100$. This suggests that the current dosing regimen is likely to be effective in eradicating the pathogen.\n\nThe problem asks for the single numerical value of the index to be reported as the final answer.\nThe computed value is $240$.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem states that the drug concentration, $C(t)$, follows a mono-exponential decline. This is characteristic of a first-order elimination process. The concentration at any time $t$ after the peak concentration is given by:\n$$ C(t) = C(0) e^{-k_e t} $$\nHere, the time $t=0$ corresponds to the moment the peak concentration is achieved, so $C(0) = C_{\\max} = 6\\,\\text{mg/L}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ C(t) = C_{\\max} e^{-k_e t} = 6 e^{-k_e t} $$\nwhere $k_e$ is the elimination rate constant.\n\nWe can determine $k_e$ using the trough concentration, $C_{\\min}$, which occurs at the end of the dosing interval, $t = \\tau = 12~\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$ C_{\\min} = C_{\\max} e^{-k_e \\tau} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ 1.5\\,\\text{mg/L} = (6\\,\\text{mg/L}) e^{-k_e (12~\\mathrm{h})} $$\nTo solve for $k_e$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$ \\frac{1.5}{6} = e^{-12 k_e} $$\n$$ 0.25 = e^{-12 k_e} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(0.25) = -12 k_e $$\n$$ \\ln(1/4) = -12 k_e $$\n$$ -\\ln(4) = -12 k_e $$\n$$ k_e = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{12} ~\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nNumerically, $k_e \\approx \\frac{1.38629}{12} ~\\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.11552~\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe Mutant Selection Window (MSW) is defined as the concentration range between the MIC and the MPC.\n$$ \\mathrm{MSW} = [ \\mathrm{MIC}, \\mathrm{MPC} ] = [ 0.5\\,\\text{mg/L}, 4\\,\\text{mg/L} ] $$\nWe need to find the duration for which the drug concentration $C(t)$ is within this range, i.e., $0.5 \\le C(t) \\le 4$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the time, $t_{\\mathrm{entry}}$, at which the concentration enters the MSW by dropping to the level of the MPC.\n$$ C(t_{\\mathrm{entry}}) = \\mathrm{MPC} $$\n$$ 6 e^{-k_e t_{\\mathrm{entry}}} = 4 $$\n$$ e^{-k_e t_{\\mathrm{entry}}} = \\frac{4}{6} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\n$$ -k_e t_{\\mathrm{entry}} = \\ln(2/3) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{entry}} = \\frac{-\\ln(2/3)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(3/2)}{k_e} $$\nSubstituting $k_e = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{12}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{entry}} = \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{\\frac{\\ln(4)}{12}} = 12 \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{\\ln(4)} $$\nUsing numerical values, $\\ln(1.5) \\approx 0.40547$ and $\\ln(4) \\approx 1.38629$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{entry}} \\approx 12 \\times \\frac{0.40547}{1.38629} \\approx 12 \\times 0.29248 \\approx 3.51~\\mathrm{h} $$\nSo, for $t  3.51~\\mathrm{h}$, the concentration is above the MPC and thus above the MSW. At $t \\approx 3.51~\\mathrm{h}$, the concentration enters the MSW.\n\nNext, we must determine if and when the concentration falls below the MIC, which is the lower bound of the MSW. Let's call this time $t_{\\mathrm{exit}}$.\n$$ C(t_{\\mathrm{exit}}) = \\mathrm{MIC} $$\n$$ 6 e^{-k_e t_{\\mathrm{exit}}} = 0.5 $$\n$$ e^{-k_e t_{\\mathrm{exit}}} = \\frac{0.5}{6} = \\frac{1}{12} $$\n$$ -k_e t_{\\mathrm{exit}} = \\ln(1/12) = -\\ln(12) $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{exit}} = \\frac{\\ln(12)}{k_e} = \\frac{\\ln(12)}{\\frac{\\ln(4)}{12}} = 12 \\frac{\\ln(12)}{\\ln(4)} $$\nUsing numerical values, $\\ln(12) \\approx 2.4849$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{exit}} \\approx 12 \\times \\frac{2.4849}{1.38629} \\approx 12 \\times 1.7925 \\approx 21.51~\\mathrm{h} $$\nThe time to fall below the MIC is approximately $21.51~\\mathrm{h}$.

Our calculations show that the concentration enters the MSW at $t_{\\mathrm{entry}} \\approx 3.5~\\mathrm{h}$. It remains within the MSW for the remainder of the $12~\\mathrm{h}$ interval, as the trough concentration is above the MIC.
