It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacokinetics, presents a well-posed problem with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All components of the problem are amenable to rigorous mathematical treatment.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested, followed by the final numerical computation.\n\n1. Derivation of the elimination rate constant $k$ in terms of clearance $CL$ and volume of distribution $V$.\n\nLet $A(t)$ be the amount of drug in the body at time $t$ and $C(t)$ be the plasma concentration of the drug at time $t$. The problem provides two fundamental definitions:\nThe apparent volume of distribution, $V$, is defined as:\n$$V = \\frac{A(t)}{C(t)}$$\nRearranging this gives the amount of drug in the body as a function of concentration:\n$$A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$$\nClearance, $CL$, is defined as the ratio of the elimination rate to the plasma concentration. The elimination rate is the rate of decrease of the amount of drug in the body, which is mathematically expressed as $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}$.\n$$CL = \\frac{-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt}}{C(t)}$$\nFor a first-order elimination process, the rate of elimination is directly proportional to the amount of drug in the body. The constant of proportionality is the first-order elimination rate constant, $k$.\n$$-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for the elimination rate into the definition of clearance:\n$$CL = \\frac{k \\cdot A(t)}{C(t)}$$\nNext, substitute the expression for $A(t)$ from the definition of the volume of distribution, $A(t) = V \\cdot C(t)$, into the equation for $CL$:\n$$CL = \\frac{k \\cdot (V \\cdot C(t))}{C(t)}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration $C(t)$, the term cancels out, leaving a direct relationship between $CL$, $k$, and $V$:\n$$CL = k \\cdot V$$\nSolving for the elimination rate constant, $k$, yields the desired expression:\n$$k = \\frac{CL}{V}$$\n\n2. Derivation of the elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$ in terms of $k$.\n\nThe amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, undergoing first-order elimination from an initial amount $A_0$ at time $t=0$ is described by the differential equation $-\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = k \\cdot A(t)$. The solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$A(t) = A_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThe elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the amount of drug in the body to decrease to one-half of its initial value. At $t = t_{1/2}$, the amount is $A(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\\frac{A_0}{2} = A_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nDividing both sides by $A_0$ (assuming $A_0 > 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(-k t_{1/2}))$$\nUsing the logarithmic identity $\\ln(e^x) = x$, we have:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nAnd using the property $\\ln(\\frac{1}{x}) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$ gives the final expression:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n\n3. Determination of the longest dosing interval $\\tau$ in terms of $k$.\n\nFor repeated IV bolus dosing at a fixed interval $\\tau$, a steady state is reached where the amount of drug eliminated over one interval equals the dose administered. Let $C_{ss,peak}$ be the peak plasma concentration at steady state (immediately after a dose) and $C_{ss,trough}$ be the trough concentration at steady state (immediately before the next dose).\nBetween doses, the concentration decays exponentially with the rate constant $k$. Therefore, the trough concentration is related to the peak concentration from the same interval by:\n$$C_{ss,trough} = C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint that the peak-to-trough ratio at steady state does not exceed $2$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,peak}}{C_{ss,trough}} \\le 2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{ss,trough}$:\n$$\\frac{C_{ss,peak}}{C_{ss,peak} \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\le 2$$\nThe term $C_{ss,peak}$ cancels, and $\\frac{1}{\\exp(-k\\tau)} = \\exp(k\\tau)$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\\exp(k\\tau) \\le 2$$\nTo find the longest possible dosing interval, $\\tau_{max}$, that satisfies this criterion, we set the expression to its maximum allowed value:\n$$\\exp(k\\tau_{max}) = 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$k\\tau_{max} = \\ln(2)$$\nSolving for $\\tau_{max}$ (which we will simply call $\\tau$ as per the problem's request for the longest interval):\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\n\nNumerical computation.\nThe provided values are $V = 40\\,\\text{L}$ and $CL = 15\\,\\text{L/h}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the elimination rate constant $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{CL}{V} = \\frac{15\\,\\text{L/h}}{40\\,\\text{L}} = 0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$$\nNext, we compute the elimination half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{0.693147}{0.375}\\,\\text{h} \\approx 1.84839\\,\\text{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $t_{1/2} = 1.848\\,\\text{h}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the longest dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.375\\,\\text{h}^{-1}} \\approx 1.84839\\,\\text{h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\tau = 1.848\\,\\text{h}$.\nThe numerical values for the half-life and the longest dosing interval (for a peak-to-trough ratio of $2$) are identical.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, is well-posed, and all necessary data for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive an expression for systemic clearance (CL) and compute its numerical value for a patient at steady state.\n\nFirst, we begin with the fundamental definition of clearance for a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is the proportionality constant that relates the rate of drug elimination from the body, $\\frac{dX_e}{dt}$, to the instantaneous plasma drug concentration, $C(t)$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_e}{dt} = CL \\times C(t)\n$$\nwhere $X_e$ is the cumulative amount of drug eliminated.\n\nTo find the total amount of drug eliminated over a specific time interval, for instance, from time $t_1$ to $t_2$, we integrate the rate of elimination over that interval:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Eliminated}_{t_1 \\to t_2} = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} \\frac{dX_e}{dt} \\,dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} CL \\times C(t) \\,dt\n$$\nSince clearance, $CL$, is a constant in a linear pharmacokinetic system, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Eliminated}_{t_1 \\to t_2} = CL \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} C(t) \\,dt\n$$\nThe integral of the concentration-time curve, $\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} C(t) \\,dt$, is by definition the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) from $t_1$ to $t_2$.

Therefore, the expression becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Amount Eliminated}_{t_1 \\to t_2} = CL \\times AUC_{t_1-t_2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the patient is at steady state. A critical principle of steady state is that over one or more complete dosing intervals, the amount of drug administered that becomes systemically available is equal to the amount of drug eliminated from the body.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the pharmacodynamic index representing the ratio of free-drug exposure to organism susceptibility over a $24$-hour period, denoted as $fAUC/MIC$. This index is a key predictor of efficacy for certain classes of antibiotics.\n\nThe formula for this index is derived directly from its name:\n$$ \\frac{fAUC}{MIC} = \\frac{f \\times AUC_{0-24}}{MIC} $$\nHere, $f$ is the unbound fraction of the drug, $AUC_{0-24}$ is the total drug area under the concentration-time curve over $24$ hours, and $MIC$ is the minimum inhibitory concentration for the infecting organism. The product $f \\times AUC_{0-24}$ gives the free-drug area under the curve, $fAUC_{0-24}$, which represents the exposure to the pharmacologically active component of the drug.\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $f = 0.20$ (unitless)\n- $AUC_{0-24} = 120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}$\n- $MIC = 0.25\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the free-drug exposure over $24$ hours, $fAUC_{0-24}$:\n$$ fAUC_{0-24} = f \\times AUC_{0-24} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ fAUC_{0-24} = 0.20 \\times 120\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L} = 24\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the ratio of this free-drug exposure to the MIC:\n$$ \\frac{fAUC}{MIC} = \\frac{fAUC_{0-24}}{MIC} $$\n$$ \\frac{fAUC}{MIC} = \\frac{24\\,\\text{mg}\\cdot\\text{h}/\\text{L}}{0.25\\,\\text{mg}/\\text{L}} $$\n\nA strict dimensional analysis shows that the units of $\\text{mg}/\\text{L}$ cancel, leaving units of hours ($\\text{h}$).
