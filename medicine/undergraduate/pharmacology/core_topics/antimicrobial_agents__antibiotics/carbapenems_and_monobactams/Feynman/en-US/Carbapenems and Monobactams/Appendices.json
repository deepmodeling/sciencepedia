            "problem": "A clinical pharmacology lab is characterizing hydrolysis of two carbapenem antibiotics, imipenem and meropenem, by New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1). The enzyme kinetics were measured under initial-rate conditions in buffered solution at $37\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$. The following parameters were obtained:\n\n- Imipenem: $k_{\\text{cat}} = 3.1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $K_{M} = 180\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n- Meropenem: $k_{\\text{cat}} = 0.95\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $K_{M} = 420\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nStarting from the foundational framework of Michaelis–Menten enzymology and accepted definitions of $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_{M}$, reason which carbapenem is more pharmacologically compromised by NDM-1 and quantitatively compare the relative catalytic efficiencies under substrate-limited conditions. Report your final result as the fold-difference in catalytic efficiency of imipenem relative to meropenem, expressed as a unitless number. Round your answer to $3$ significant figures.",
            "solution": "The analysis begins with the foundational principles of Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics. The initial reaction velocity, $V_0$, for an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is described as a function of the substrate concentration, $[S]$, by the equation:\n$$ V_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{max}} [S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nIn this expression, $V_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum reaction rate achieved at saturating substrate concentrations, and $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, representing the substrate concentration at which the reaction velocity is half of $V_{\\text{max}}$. The maximum velocity is directly proportional to the total enzyme concentration, $[E]_T$, and the catalytic constant, $k_{\\text{cat}}$, which is the turnover number (the number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time). This relationship is given by:\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T $$\nSubstituting this into the Michaelis-Menten equation provides a more comprehensive form:\n$$ V_0 = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M + [S]} $$\nThe provided kinetic parameters, $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_M$, are intrinsic properties of the enzyme-substrate interaction under the specified experimental conditions (buffered solution at $37\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$).\n\nThe problem requests a comparison under \"substrate-limited conditions.\" This condition is formally defined by the inequality $[S] \\ll K_M$. In this regime, the concentration of the substrate (the antibiotic) is significantly lower than the Michaelis constant. Consequently, the denominator of the rate equation simplifies, as $K_M + [S] \\approx K_M$. The rate equation reduces to:\n$$ V_0 \\approx \\frac{k_{\\text{cat}} [E]_T [S]}{K_M} = \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right) [E]_T [S] $$\nThis simplified equation is a second-order rate law, where the rate is proportional to both enzyme and substrate concentrations. The term $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}$ is the apparent second-order rate constant, known as the catalytic efficiency or specificity constant. This constant is the most relevant measure for comparing an enzyme's effectiveness on different substrates when substrate is the limiting factor, as is often the case in physiological or pharmacological contexts.\n\nA higher catalytic efficiency signifies that the enzyme (NDM-1) is more effective at hydrolyzing and thus inactivating the substrate (the carbapenem antibiotic). Therefore, the carbapenem associated with a higher $\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}$ value is more readily destroyed by NDM-1 and is considered more \"pharmacologically compromised.\"\n\nWe are provided with the kinetic parameters for the two carbapenems:\n- Imipenem (I): $k_{\\text{cat, I}} = 3.1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $K_{M, I} = 180\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n- Meropenem (M): $k_{\\text{cat, M}} = 0.95\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ and $K_{M, M} = 420\\ \\mu\\text{M}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the catalytic efficiency for each substrate.\nFor imipenem:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_I = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat, I}}}{K_{M, I}} = \\frac{3.1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{180\\ \\mu\\text{M}} \\approx 0.01722\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\mu\\text{M}^{-1} $$\nFor meropenem:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_M = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat, M}}}{K_{M, M}} = \\frac{0.95\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{420\\ \\mu\\text{M}} \\approx 0.00226\\ \\text{s}^{-1}\\mu\\text{M}^{-1} $$\nComparing these values, we find that $0.01722 > 0.00226$. Thus, NDM-1 has a higher catalytic efficiency for imipenem than for meropenem, indicating that imipenem's therapeutic efficacy is more severely compromised by this enzyme.\n\nThe problem requires a quantitative comparison, specifically the fold-difference in catalytic efficiency of imipenem relative to meropenem. This is calculated as the ratio of their respective specificity constants:\n$$ \\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_I}{\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{cat}}}{K_M}\\right)_M} = \\frac{k_{\\text{cat, I}}}{K_{M, I}} \\cdot \\frac{K_{M, M}}{k_{\\text{cat, M}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values into this expression:\n$$ \\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{(3.1\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (420\\ \\mu\\text{M})}{(0.95\\ \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (180\\ \\mu\\text{M})} $$\nThe units $\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $\\mu\\text{M}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless ratio as required.\n$$ \\text{Fold-difference} = \\frac{3.1 \\times 420}{0.95 \\times 180} = \\frac{1302}{171} \\approx 7.614035... $$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value is $7.61$. This result indicates that under substrate-limited conditions, NDM-1 hydrolyzes imipenem approximately $7.61$ times more efficiently than it hydrolyzes meropenem.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two pharmacokinetic parameters for the antibiotic meropenem, administered as a continuous intravenous (IV) infusion: the infusion rate ($R_0$) required to maintain a target steady-state concentration, and the loading dose ($LD$) required to achieve this concentration instantaneously. The analysis will be based on a linear, one-compartment pharmacokinetic model.\n\nFirst, we calculate the infusion rate, $R_0$.\nThe fundamental principle of steady state ($ss$) for a drug administered by constant-rate infusion is that the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination from the body.\nThe rate of administration is the infusion rate, $R_0$.\nThe rate of elimination is the product of the total drug clearance ($\\mathrm{Cl}$) and the total plasma concentration at steady state ($C_{ss,total}$).\nTherefore, at steady state, we have the relationship:\n$$R_0 = \\mathrm{Cl} \\times C_{ss,total}$$\n\nThe problem provides a target for the free (unbound) plasma concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,free} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$. The total concentration is related to the free concentration by the fraction unbound, $f_u$. The fraction unbound is defined as the ratio of the free drug concentration to the total drug concentration in plasma:\n$$f_u = \\frac{C_{free}}{C_{total}}$$\nThis relationship holds at any time, including at steady state:\n$$f_u = \\frac{C_{ss,free}}{C_{ss,total}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the total steady-state concentration in terms of the target free concentration and the fraction unbound:\n$$C_{ss,total} = \\frac{C_{ss,free}}{f_u}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{ss,total}$ into our steady-state infusion rate equation gives the formula for $R_0$ based on the provided givens:\n$$R_0 = \\mathrm{Cl} \\times \\frac{C_{ss,free}}{f_u}$$\nThe given values are:\n- Clearance, $\\mathrm{Cl} = 12\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n- Target free steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,free} = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- Fraction unbound, $f_u = 0.98$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for $R_0$:\n$$R_0 = (12\\,\\mathrm{L/h}) \\times \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{0.98}$$\n$$R_0 = \\frac{96}{0.98}\\,\\mathrm{mg/h} \\approx 97.95918\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the infusion rate is:\n$$R_0 = 97.96\\,\\mathrm{mg/h}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the loading dose, $LD$.\nA loading dose is an initial, larger dose of a drug given to rapidly achieve the target therapeutic concentration. In a one-compartment model, the loading dose is the amount of drug needed to fill the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$) to the desired total target concentration ($C_{target,total}$). The fundamental relationship is:\n$$LD = V_d \\times C_{target,total}$$\nThe target concentration for the loading dose is the total concentration that corresponds to the target free concentration, which is the same as the total steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,total}$.\n$$C_{target,total} = C_{ss,total} = \\frac{C_{ss,free}}{f_u} = \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{0.98}$$\nThe problem provides the specific volume of distribution, $V_{d,specific} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{L/kg}$, and the patient's weight, $W = 75\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.
