Express your final answer in nanomoles per liter (nM) and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated against the validation criteria and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of enzyme kinetics (Michaelis-Menten model) and pharmacology (competitive inhibition). The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe uninhibited reaction velocity, $v_0$, is described by the Michaelis–Menten equation:\n$$v_0 = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}$$\nwhere $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction velocity, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nThe antiviral agent is a reversible competitive inhibitor. In competitive inhibition, the inhibitor molecule, $I$, binds reversibly to the free enzyme, $E$, forming an enzyme-inhibitor complex, $EI$. This binding event prevents the substrate from binding to the enzyme. The effect of a competitive inhibitor is to increase the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, without affecting the maximum velocity, $V_{max}$. The apparent Michaelis constant is given by:\n$$K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right)$$\nHere, $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration and $K_i$ is the inhibition constant, which represents the dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex ($K_i = \\frac{[E][I]}{[EI]}$).\n\nThe velocity of the inhibited reaction, $v_i$, is then given by the Michaelis–Menten equation with the apparent Michaelis constant:\n$$v_i = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_{m,app} + [S]} = \\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]}$$\n\nThe problem requires a reduction in enzymatic activity of strictly greater than $90\\%$. This translates to the condition that the inhibited velocity, $v_i$, must be less than $10\\%$ of the uninhibited velocity, $v_0$.\n$$v_i < 0.10 \\cdot v_0$$\n\nWe can express this inequality by substituting the expressions for $v_i$ and $v_0$:\n$$\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} < 0.10 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{V_{max} [S]}{K_m + [S]}\\right)$$\n\nThe term $V_{max} [S]$ is non-zero, so it can be canceled from both sides of the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} < \\frac{0.10}{K_m + [S]}$$\n\nSince all concentrations and constants ($K_m$, $[S]$, $[I]$, $K_i$) are positive, the denominators on both sides are positive. We can take the reciprocal of both sides, which reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S] > \\frac{K_m + [S]}{0.10}$$\n$$K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S] > 10 (K_m + [S])$$\n\nNow, we must isolate $[I]$ to determine the required concentration.\n$$K_m + \\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} + [S] > 10 K_m + 10 [S]$$\n$$\\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} > (10 K_m - K_m) + (10 [S] - [S])$$\n$$\\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} > 9 K_m + 9 [S]$$\n$$\\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} > 9 (K_m + [S])$$\n\nSolving for $[I]$:\n$$[I] > \\frac{9 K_i (K_m + [S])}{K_m}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$[I] > 9 K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$$\n\nThis inequality defines the condition for the inhibitor concentration. The minimum concentration required is the boundary value of this inequality.\nThe provided values are:\n$[S] = 500\\,\\text{\\textmu M}$\n$K_m = 250\\,\\text{\\textmu M}$\n$K_i = 0.80\\,\\text{nM}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless term $\\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right)$. The units of $[S]$ and $K_m$ are both $\\text{\\textmu M}$, so they will cancel.\n$$\\frac{[S]}{K_m} = \\frac{500\\,\\text{\\textmu M}}{250\\,\\text{\\textmu M}} = 2$$\nTherefore,\n$$1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m} = 1 + 2 = 3$$\n\nNow, substitute this result back into the inequality for $[I]$:\n$$[I] > 9 \\cdot K_i \\cdot 3$$\n$$[I] > 27 \\cdot K_i$$\n\nUsing the given value for $K_i$:\n$$[I] > 27 \\cdot (0.80\\,\\text{nM})$$\n$$[I] > 21.6\\,\\text{nM}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum inhibitor concentration required to achieve a strictly greater than $90\\%$ reduction. This corresponds to the infimum of the set of concentrations satisfying the inequality, which is $21.6\\,\\text{nM}$. The result is requested to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $21.6$ already has three significant figures. Therefore, the minimum concentration is $21.6\\,\\text{nM}$.",

It is a standard pharmacokinetic calculation grounded in established principles. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe primary goal is to find a new dose, $D_{imp}$, for a patient with impaired renal function that yields the same Area Under the Curve, $AUC_{imp}$, as the standard dose, $D_{norm}$, in a patient with normal renal function, $AUC_{norm}$. The dosing interval remains constant.\nThe condition is:\n$$AUC_{imp} = AUC_{norm}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, a drug's AUC is proportional to the dose divided by total clearance. Let the proportionality constant be $k$ and the oral bioavailability be $F$.\n$$AUC_i = k \\frac{F \\cdot D_i}{CL_{total, i}}$$\nApplying the target condition:\n$$k \\frac{F \\cdot D_{imp}}{CL_{total, imp}} = k \\frac{F \\cdot D_{norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nSince the bioavailability $F$ is assumed to be unchanged and $k$ is a constant, they cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{D_{imp}}{CL_{total, imp}} = \\frac{D_{norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nSolving for the adjusted dose, $D_{imp}$:\n$$D_{imp} = D_{norm} \\left( \\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} \\right)$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the ratio of total clearance in the impaired patient to that in the normal patient.\n\nTotal body clearance, $CL_{total}$, is the sum of renal clearance, $CL_R$, and nonrenal clearance, $CL_{NR}$:\n$$CL_{total} = CL_R + CL_{NR}$$\nFor a patient with normal renal function, we have:\n$$CL_{total, norm} = CL_{R, norm} + CL_{NR, norm}$$\nThe fraction of the drug eliminated by the kidneys in a subject with normal renal function is given as $f_e = 0.90$.\n$$f_e = \\frac{CL_{R, norm}}{CL_{total, norm}}$$\nFrom this, we can express the renal and nonrenal clearance components for a normal individual in terms of total clearance:\n$$CL_{R, norm} = f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\n$$CL_{NR, norm} = CL_{total, norm} - CL_{R, norm} = CL_{total, norm} - (f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}) = (1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\nThe problem states that nonrenal clearance does not depend on creatinine clearance. Therefore, it is constant for both patients:\n$$CL_{NR, imp} = CL_{NR, norm} = (1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}$$\nThe problem also states that renal clearance is proportional to creatinine clearance ($CrCl$). Let $c$ be the constant of proportionality.\n$$CL_R = c \\cdot CrCl$$\nThis implies a direct linear relationship. We can therefore write the ratio of the renal clearances for the two patients:\n$$\\frac{CL_{R, imp}}{CL_{R, norm}} = \\frac{c \\cdot CrCl_{imp}}{c \\cdot CrCl_{norm}} = \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}}$$\nSo, the renal clearance in the impaired patient is:\n$$CL_{R, imp} = CL_{R, norm} \\left( \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} \\right) = (f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm}) \\left( \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} \\right)$$\nNow, we can assemble the expression for the total clearance in the impaired patient, $CL_{total, imp}$:\n$$CL_{total, imp} = CL_{R, imp} + CL_{NR, imp}$$\n$$CL_{total, imp} = \\left(f_e \\cdot CL_{total, norm} \\cdot \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}}\\right) + \\left((1 - f_e) \\cdot CL_{total, norm}\\right)$$\nFactoring out $CL_{total, norm}$:\n$$CL_{total, imp} = CL_{total, norm} \\left( f_e \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} + (1 - f_e) \\right)$$\nThe required ratio of clearances is:\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = f_e \\frac{CrCl_{imp}}{CrCl_{norm}} + (1 - f_e)$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $D_{norm} = 75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$\n-   $f_e = 0.90$\n-   $CrCl_{norm} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n-   $CrCl_{imp} = 30\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the clearance ratio expression:\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = (0.90) \\left( \\frac{30}{100} \\right) + (1 - 0.90)$$\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = (0.90)(0.30) + 0.10$$\n$$\\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} = 0.27 + 0.10 = 0.37$$\nFinally, calculate the adjusted dose, $D_{imp}$:\n$$D_{imp} = D_{norm} \\left( \\frac{CL_{total, imp}}{CL_{total, norm}} \\right)$$\n$$D_{imp} = 75\\ \\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.37$$\n$$D_{imp} = 27.75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The result $27.75$ already has four significant figures.\nThe adjusted dose to maintain the same AUC is $27.75\\ \\mathrm{mg}$ per administration.",
