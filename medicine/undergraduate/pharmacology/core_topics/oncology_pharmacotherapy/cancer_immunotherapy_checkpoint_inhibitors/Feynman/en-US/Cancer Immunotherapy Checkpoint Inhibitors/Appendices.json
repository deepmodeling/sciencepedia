            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and objectivity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Reaction: $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$, where $L$ is a free mAb ligand, $R$ is a free PD-1 receptor, and $LR$ is the ligand-receptor complex.\n- Binding characteristics: Monovalent binding (one ligand site per receptor), well-mixed system, at equilibrium.\n- Kinetic rate constants: $k_{on} = 10^{5}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}$ (association rate constant) and $k_{off} = 10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$ (dissociation rate constant).\n- Receptor surface density: $5000$ molecules per T cell.\n- Assumption: Negligible ligand depletion, so free ligand concentration $[L]$ is approximated by the total applied ligand concentration.\n- Objective 1: Derive the fractional occupancy $f$ as a function of $[L]$ and the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{D}$.\n- Objective 2: Compute the numerical value of $K_{D}$.\n- Objective 3: Compute the free ligand concentration $[L]$ required to achieve a fractional occupancy of $f = 0.90$.\n- Output requirements: Express numerical answers in nanomolar (nM) and round to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and receptor theory, specifically the law of mass action applied to ligand-receptor binding. The context (PD-1 checkpoint inhibition) is a core topic in modern pharmacology and oncology. The given kinetic parameters are physically realistic for monoclonal antibody interactions. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information ($k_{on}$, $k_{off}$, target occupancy $f$) to derive the requested expression and calculate the required values. The derivation and subsequent calculations lead to a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a standard, formalizable problem in biophysical chemistry and pharmacology. The inclusion of the PD-1 surface density alongside the \"negligible depletion\" assumption does not represent a contradiction but rather requires a justification of why the surface density is not needed for the calculation, a task explicitly requested in the problem statement.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe reversible binding reaction is given by:\n$$\nL + R \\underset{k_{off}}{\\stackrel{k_{on}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} LR\n$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the ligand-receptor complex, $v_{f}$, is proportional to the concentrations of the free ligand $[L]$ and free receptor $[R]$:\n$$\nv_{f} = k_{on} [L] [R]\n$$\nThe rate of dissociation of the complex, $v_{d}$, is proportional to the concentration of the complex $[LR]$:\n$$\nv_{d} = k_{off} [LR]\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the rate of formation equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$\nv_{f} = v_{d}\n$$\n$$\nk_{on} [L] [R] = k_{off} [LR]\n$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_{D}$, is defined as the ratio of the dissociation rate constant to the association rate constant:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}\n$$\nBy rearranging the equilibrium condition, we can relate $K_{D}$ to the concentrations of the species:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{[L][R]}{[LR]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_{T}]$, is the sum of the free receptors $[R]$ and the bound receptors $[LR]$:\n$$\n[R_{T}] = [R] + [LR]\n$$\nFractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are occupied by the ligand:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[LR]}{[R_{T}]}\n$$\nTo derive $f$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_{D}$, we first express $[R]$ in terms of $[R_T]$ and $[LR]$:\n$$\n[R] = [R_{T}] - [LR]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_{D}$:\n$$\nK_{D} = \\frac{[L]([R_{T}] - [LR])}{[LR]}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the ratio $\\frac{[LR]}{[R_{T}]}$:\n$$\nK_{D} [LR] = [L][R_{T}] - [L][LR]\n$$\n$$\nK_{D} [LR] + [L][LR] = [L][R_{T}]\n$$\n$$\n[LR](K_{D} + [L]) = [L][R_{T}]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[LR]}{[R_{T}]} = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}}\n$$\nThus, the expression for fractional occupancy is:\n$$\nf = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}}\n$$\nThis is the required relationship. It is a form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a system with a single class of independent binding sites (Hill coefficient of $1$).\n\n**Justification for PD-1 Surface Density**\nThe problem asks to justify how the PD-1 surface density ($5000$ molecules per T cell) affects the occupancy expression under the assumption of negligible ligand depletion.\nThe derived expression $f = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}}$ depends only on the free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$. It does not explicitly involve the total receptor concentration $[R_{T}]$. The surface density information would be used to calculate $[R_{T}]$ if the cell density were provided.\nThe assumption of \"negligible ligand depletion\" means that the concentration of bound ligand, $[LR]$, is insignificant compared to the total ligand concentration, $[L_T]$. Therefore, the free ligand concentration at equilibrium, $[L]$, can be accurately approximated by the total applied concentration: $[L] \\approx [L_T]$. This condition holds when $[L_T] \\gg [R_T]$.\nBecause we assume $[L]$ is a known, independent variable (approximated by the total applied concentration), the calculation of $[R_T]$ from the surface density is unnecessary to determine the fractional occupancy $f$. In this regime, there is a vast excess of ligand, and the fraction of occupied receptors is determined solely by the free ligand concentration and the intrinsic binding affinity ($K_D$), not by the number of receptors present. If ligand depletion were significant (i.e., $[L_T] \\sim [R_T]$), we would need to solve a more complex system of equations where $[L] = [L_T] - [LR]$, and the value of $[R_T]$ (and thus the surface density) would be essential.\n\n**Calculations**\n\n1.  **Compute the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{D}$**:\n    Using the definition $K_{D} = \\frac{k_{off}}{k_{on}}$ and the given kinetic parameters:\n    $$\n    K_{D} = \\frac{10^{-4}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{10^{5}\\ \\text{M}^{-1}\\text{s}^{-1}} = 10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}\n    $$\n    To express this in nanomolar (nM), we use the conversion $1\\ \\text{nM} = 10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}$.\n    $$\n    K_{D} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{M} = 1.00\\ \\text{nM}\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, $K_D$ is $1.00\\ \\text{nM}$.\n\n2.  **Compute the free ligand concentration $[L]$ for $f = 0.90$**:\n    We rearrange the fractional occupancy equation to solve for $[L]$:\n    $$\n    f = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{D}} \\implies f([L] + K_{D}) = [L]\n    $$\n    $$\n    f[L] + f K_{D} = [L]\n    $$\n    $$\n    f K_{D} = [L] - f[L] = [L](1 - f)\n    $$\n    $$\n    [L] = K_{D} \\frac{f}{1 - f}\n    $$\n    Now, substitute the values $K_{D} = 10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}$ and $f = 0.90$:\n    $$\n    [L] = (10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}) \\times \\frac{0.90}{1 - 0.90} = (10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}) \\times \\frac{0.90}{0.10} = (10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}) \\times 9\n    $$\n    $$\n    [L] = 9 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{M}\n    $$\n    Converting to nanomolar:\n    $$\n    [L] = 9.00\\ \\text{nM}\n    $$\n    Rounded to three significant figures, the required ligand concentration is $9.00\\ \\text{nM}$.",

At baseline, assume CD28 is present at $R_{28} = 30000$ surface molecules per cell and CTLA-4 is present at $R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 5000$ surface molecules per cell.

Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Receptors on T cell: Cluster of Differentiation 28 (CD28) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4).\n- Ligand on Antigen-Presenting Cell (APC): CD80 (B7-1), with CD86 (B7-2) also mentioned but the problem focuses on CD80.\n- Baseline CD28 surface molecules per cell: $R_{28} = 30000$.\n- Baseline CTLA-4 surface molecules per cell: $R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 5000$.\n- Baseline dissociation constant for CD28–CD80: $K_d^{28} = 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\n- Dissociation constant for CTLA-4–CD80: $K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 0.4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\n- Condition: The system is in a \"low-ligand, competition-limited regime,\" where the ligand (CD80) is scarce.\n- Mutation $1$: Increases CD28 surface molecules to $R_{28}' = 45000$, with no change to $K_d^{28}$.\n- Mutation $2$: Doubles the apparent dissociation constant for CD28–CD80 to $K_d^{28}'' = 8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$, with no change to $R_{28}$.\n- Constraint: The analysis must focus strictly on inhibition arising from ligand competition, ignoring intracellular signaling mechanisms of CTLA-4.\n- Constraint: CTLA-4 levels ($R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$) and affinity ($K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$) are unchanged in both mutation scenarios.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of T-cell costimulation and coinhibition. CD28 (activating) and CTLA-4 (inhibiting) are known competitors for the ligands CD80 and CD86. The concept of competition being governed by receptor density and affinity is fundamental. The specified mutations and their effects (altering receptor trafficking to change surface density, or altering cytoskeletal coupling to change avidity/apparent affinity) are biologically plausible mechanisms used in modeling such systems. The dissociation constants are within a realistic order of magnitude for such interactions.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear theoretical framework (competitive binding under low-ligand conditions) and all necessary parameters to quantitatively analyze the competitive balance. The question asks for a qualitative comparison of the outcome of two distinct perturbations, which can be uniquely determined from the provided model.\n- **Objective**: The problem is objective and quantitative. It asks for a scientific prediction based on a simplified model, free of subjective language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the instructions (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). The explicit instruction to ignore CTLA-4's intracellular signaling is a valid simplifying assumption that makes the problem tractable by focusing it on the biophysics of receptor competition.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks how two different mutations in the CD28 receptor affect the T cell's sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. The problem explicitly constrains the mechanism of inhibition to competition for a shared ligand, CD80. Therefore, \"sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition\" is a direct function of how successfully CTLA-4 can bind the limited pool of CD80 ligand at the expense of CD28.\n\nWe can model this using the law of mass action for competitive binding. Let $[L \\cdot R_{28}]$ be the concentration of CD28-ligand complexes and $[L \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}]$ be the concentration of CTLA-4-ligand complexes.\nThe respective equilibrium equations are:\n$$K_d^{28} = \\frac{[L_{free}][R_{28, free}]}{[L \\cdot R_{28}]}$$\n$$K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = \\frac{[L_{free}][R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}, free}]}{[L \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}]}$$\n\nThe problem states the system is in a \"low-ligand, competition-limited regime.\" This implies that the total number of ligand molecules is much smaller than the total number of receptor molecules. Consequently, only a small fraction of receptors will be bound, and the concentration of free receptors can be approximated by the total receptor concentration (or surface number):\n$[R_{28, free}] \\approx R_{28}$\n$[R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}, free}] \\approx R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$\n\nWe can rearrange the equilibrium equations to express the number of bound complexes:\n$$[L \\cdot R_{28}] \\approx \\frac{[L_{free}]R_{28}}{K_d^{28}}$$\n$$[L \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}] \\approx \\frac{[L_{free}]R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\n\nTo evaluate the competitive success of CTLA-4 against CD28, we can examine the ratio, $\\rho$, of CTLA-4-bound ligand to CD28-bound ligand. An increase in this ratio signifies that CTLA-4 is more effectively outcompeting CD28, thus increasing the T-cell's sensitivity to this form of inhibition.\n$$\\rho = \\frac{[L \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}]}{[L \\cdot R_{28}]} \\approx \\frac{[L_{free}]R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}/K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{[L_{free}]R_{28}/K_d^{28}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{R_{28}} \\cdot \\frac{K_d^{28}}{K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}$$\n\nThe quantity $R/K_d$ can be thought of as the \"binding potential\" of a receptor in this ligand-limited regime. The sensitivity to CTLA-4 inhibition is proportional to the ratio of CTLA-4's binding potential to CD28's binding potential.\nSince $R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$ and $K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}$ are constant throughout the problem, the sensitivity to CTLA-4 inhibition is inversely proportional to CD28's binding potential, $R_{28}/K_d^{28}$.\n$$ \\text{Sensitivity} \\propto \\rho \\propto \\frac{1}{R_{28}/K_d^{28}} = \\frac{K_d^{28}}{R_{28}} $$\n\nLet's analyze the baseline and the two mutations using this relationship.\n\n**Baseline:**\nThe given values are $R_{28} = 30000$, $R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 5000$, $K_d^{28} = 4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$, and $K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}} = 0.4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe baseline competitive ratio is:\n$$\\rho_{base} = \\frac{5000}{30000} \\cdot \\frac{4}{0.4} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{10}{6} \\approx 1.67$$\n\n**Mutation 1 ($Y170F$):**\nThis mutation increases the surface expression of CD28 to $R_{28}' = 45000$, while $K_d^{28}$ remains $4 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$.\nThe new competitive ratio, $\\rho_1$, is:\n$$\\rho_1 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{R_{28}'} \\cdot \\frac{K_d^{28}}{K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}} = \\frac{5000}{45000} \\cdot \\frac{4}{0.4} = \\frac{1}{9} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{10}{9} \\approx 1.11$$\nSince $\\rho_1 < \\rho_{base}$ ($1.11 < 1.67$), CTLA-4 is now less successful at competing with CD28. This means the cell's sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition is **decreased**. This is because the T cell now has more CD28 receptors to capture the scarce ligand, shifting the competitive balance in favor of activation.\n\n**Mutation 2 ($PYAP \\to AYAA$):**\nThis mutation weakens the binding of CD28 by doubling its apparent dissociation constant to $K_d^{28}'' = 8 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{M}$, while the receptor number remains at the baseline $R_{28} = 30000$.\nThe new competitive ratio, $\\rho_2$, is:\n$$\\rho_2 = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}}{R_{28}} \\cdot \\frac{K_d^{28}''}{K_d^{\\mathrm{CTLA4}}} = \\frac{5000}{30000} \\cdot \\frac{8}{0.4} = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 20 = \\frac{20}{6} \\approx 3.33$$\nSince $\\rho_2 > \\rho_{base}$ ($3.33 > 1.67$), CTLA-4 is now more successful at competing with CD28. This means the cell's sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition is **increased**. This is because each CD28 receptor is now a weaker binder, making it easier for the high-affinity CTLA-4 receptor to capture the scarce ligand.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n- Mutation $1$: Decreases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.\n- Mutation $2$: Increases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.\n\n**3. Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Mutation $1$ decreases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition, whereas Mutation $2$ increases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.**\nThis statement perfectly matches the results derived from the competitive binding model. Mutation $1$ increases the competitive strength of CD28 (by increasing $R_{28}$), thus decreasing CTLA-4's relative success and decreasing sensitivity. Mutation $2$ decreases the competitive strength of CD28 (by increasing $K_d^{28}$), thus increasing CTLA-4's relative success and increasing sensitivity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. **Mutation $1$ increases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition, whereas Mutation $2$ decreases sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.**\nThis statement is the exact opposite of our derived conclusions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Both Mutation $1$ and Mutation $2$ increase sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.**\nThis is incorrect. Our analysis showed that Mutation $1$ decreases sensitivity to CTLA-4 inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Neither mutation affects sensitivity to CTLA-4-mediated inhibition because competition depends only on the extracellular domains.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. While the binding event itself occurs via the extracellular domains, the parameters governing the outcome of this competition—namely, receptor surface density ($R_{28}$) and apparent affinity ($K_d^{28}$)—are explicitly altered by the intracellular mutations as described in the problem. The problem correctly posits that intracellular events (changes in trafficking, cytoskeletal coupling) can modulate extracellularly-relevant properties. Therefore, the mutations do affect the competitive landscape and thus the sensitivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Antigen presentation via MHC class I.\n    2.  Induction of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface.\n    3.  Recruitment of effector CD8-positive T cells.\n    4.  Likely pharmacologic response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The description of the IFN-$\\gamma$/JAK-STAT signaling pathway, its downstream targets (ISGs), and its role in cancer immunity is factually correct and represents a fundamental concept in immuno-oncology. The roles of MHC class I, PD-L1, and chemokines are accurately described.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific genetic lesion (loss-of-function `JAK1` mutation) within a clearly defined biological pathway and asks for the logical consequences. The givens are sufficient to deduce a unique outcome.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjectivity.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and clearly stated. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation from First Principles\n\nThe analysis begins with the central defect: a truncating loss-of-function mutation in `JAK1` in the cancer cells.\n\n1.  **Impact on the Signaling Cascade:** The problem states that IFN-$\\gamma$ signaling requires both JAK1 and JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT1. The loss of JAK1 function breaks this cascade at its inception. Even though abundant IFN-$\\gamma$ is present (from TILs) and binds its receptor, the signal cannot be transduced downstream because one of the essential kinases is inactive. The problem explicitly confirms this by stating that \"tumor cells fail to phosphorylate STAT1 upon IFN-$\\gamma$ exposure.\"\n\n2.  **Impact on Gene Transcription:** Since STAT1 is not phosphorylated, it cannot dimerize, translocate to the nucleus, or bind to GAS elements to activate the transcription of ISGs. Consequently, the entire program of IFN-$\\gamma$-stimulated gene expression is abolished in the cancer cells.\n\n3.  **Downstream Consequences:** We can now deduce the state of the four specified components, all of which depend on ISG expression.\n\n    -   **Antigen presentation via MHC class I:** The machinery for processing and presenting antigens on MHC class I (e.g., `TAP1`, `TAP2`, `PSMB8`, `PSMB9`) is composed of ISGs. Without `STAT1` signaling, the expression of these genes will not be upregulated. This results in a deficient antigen presentation pathway. Therefore, **antigen presentation decreases**.\n\n    -   **Induction of PD-L1:** `PD-L1` is a critical ISG, whose expression on tumor cells is a major mechanism of adaptive immune resistance. Its induction is dependent on the `STAT1` pathway. With the `JAK1` mutation, IFN-$\\gamma$ cannot induce `PD-L1` expression. Therefore, **`PD-L1` induction decreases**. The tumor cells will be `PD-L1`-negative or `PD-L1`-low, failing to upregulate it in response to the inflammatory microenvironment.\n\n    -   **Recruitment of effector CD8-positive T cells:** Chemokines such as `CXCL9`, `CXCL10`, and `CXCL11` are ISGs that create a chemical gradient to attract `CD8`+ T cells to the tumor site. Since the cancer cells cannot produce these chemokines in response to IFN-$\\gamma$, the gradient will be absent or severely diminished. Therefore, **T cell recruitment decreases**. This leads to a non-inflamed or \"cold\" tumor microenvironment, with few T cells present.\n\n    -   **Likely pharmacologic response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy:** For `PD-1`/`PD-L1` blockade to be effective, several conditions must be met. The tumor must be recognized and infiltrated by T cells, and the `PD-1`/`PD-L1` axis must be a key mechanism of immunosuppression. In this scenario:\n        -   T cell recognition is impaired due to decreased MHC class I presentation.\n        -   T cell infiltration is impaired due to decreased chemokine production.\n        -   The target of the therapy, `PD-L1`, is not being induced on the cancer cells. The drug is designed to block this interaction, but the interaction itself is absent.\n\n        The tumor is effectively invisible to the immune system and lacks the target of the drug. This is a classic mechanism of primary resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, the **response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is poor**.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions:**\n-   Antigen presentation: Decreases\n-   PD-L1 induction: Decreases\n-   T cell recruitment: Decreases\n-   Response to blockade: Poor\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Antigen presentation decreases; PD-L1 induction decreases; T cell recruitment decreases; response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is poor.**\n    This option matches every conclusion derived from a step-by-step analysis of the pathway's disruption. The loss of `JAK1` function ablates IFN-$\\gamma$ signaling, leading to reduced antigen presentation, `PD-L1` expression, and T cell-attracting chemokines, all culminating in a poor response to checkpoint inhibitor therapy.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B. Antigen presentation decreases; PD-L1 induction increases; T cell recruitment decreases; response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is poor.**\n    This option incorrectly states that `PD-L1` induction increases. `PD-L1` is an ISG whose induction is dependent on the now-broken `JAK1`/`STAT1` pathway.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Antigen presentation is unchanged; PD-L1 induction decreases; T cell recruitment increases; response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade improves.**\n    This option incorrectly claims that antigen presentation is unchanged and T cell recruitment increases. Both are dependent on ISGs and will be decreased. The prediction of an improved response is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Antigen presentation increases; PD-L1 induction decreases; T cell recruitment increases; response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade improves.**\n    This option incorrectly claims that antigen presentation and T cell recruitment increase. Both are directly impaired by the `JAK1` mutation. The prediction of an improved response is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **E. Antigen presentation decreases; PD-L1 induction decreases; T cell recruitment increases; response to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade improves.**\n    This option incorrectly claims that T cell recruitment increases. This is contradicted by the lack of chemokine production. The prediction of an improved response is also incorrect.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
