This first exercise demonstrates how a fundamental first-order elimination model can be used to forecast the clearance of a potent antimetabolite, methotrexate (MTX). By calculating the time it takes for plasma concentrations to fall below a known toxicity threshold, you will see how these principles directly inform critical clinical decisions, such as the timing and duration of leucovorin rescue therapy to protect healthy cells.

            "problem": "A patient receives a high-dose bolus of methotrexate (MTX), an antimetabolite that inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, necessitating subsequent rescue with folinic acid (leucovorin) to reduce toxicity to normal tissues. Assume a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with first-order elimination. The plasma concentration of MTX, $C(t)$, satisfies the differential equation $\\,\\frac{dC}{dt}=-k\\,C\\,$ with the initial condition $\\,C(0)=C_0\\,$, where $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.

Round the final numeric value of $t^\\ast$ to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. It employs a standard one-compartment model with first-order elimination, a fundamental concept. The subject drug (methotrexate), its mechanism (dihydrofolate reductase inhibition), and the rescue agent (leucovorin) are all factually correct. The provided numerical values for concentration, elimination rate, and toxicity threshold are clinically plausible for high-dose methotrexate therapy.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a well-posed initial value problem. It provides a differential equation, an initial condition, and all necessary parameters to find a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and objective language without any subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe plasma concentration of methotrexate, $C(t)$, is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC\n$$\nThis equation can be solved by separation of variables. We rearrange the equation to group terms involving $C$ and terms involving $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C} dC = -k \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The integration is performed from the initial time $t=0$, where the concentration is $C(0)=C_0$, to an arbitrary time $t$, where the concentration is $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince concentration $C$ is a physical quantity and must be positive, we can omit the absolute value signs.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nTo solve for $C(t)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThus, the concentration of methotrexate at any time $t$ is given by:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis is the general solution derived from first principles.\n\nNext, we must find the specific time $t^\\ast$ at which the concentration $C(t)$ falls to the target level of $0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. Let this target concentration be $C_{target} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. We set $C(t^\\ast) = C_{target}$.\n$$\nC_{target} = C_0 \\exp(-kt^\\ast)\n$$\nWe now solve for $t^\\ast$. First, we isolate the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt^\\ast)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0}\\right) = -kt^\\ast\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t^\\ast$:\n$$\nt^\\ast = -\\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{target}}{C_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{k} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_0}{C_{target}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression: $C_0 = 20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$, $C_{target} = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$, and $k = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt^\\ast = \\frac{1}{0.12\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}}\\right)\n$$\nThe units cancel appropriately, leaving the time in hours.\n$$\nt^\\ast = \\frac{1}{0.12} \\ln(200)\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nWe calculate the numerical value:\n$$\n\\ln(200) \\approx 5.298317\n$$\n$$\nt^\\ast \\approx \\frac{5.298317}{0.12}\\ \\mathrm{h} \\approx 44.15264\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nt^\\ast \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}\n$$\n\n### Leucovorin Rescue Protocol Logic\n\nBased on the problem statement and the derived value of $t^\\ast$:\n1.  **Initiation**: The protocol explicitly states that leucovorin rescue is to be initiated at $t = 24\\ \\mathrm{h}$ after the methotrexate bolus. This is a fixed, policy-driven time point.\n2.  **Continuation Logic**: The protocol requires that the rescue be continued until the MTX plasma concentration falls below the toxicity threshold of $0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. Our calculation shows that this threshold is predicted to be crossed at $t^\\ast \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. Therefore, the leucovorin rescue, which starts at $t=24\\ \\mathrm{h}$, must continue until at least $t \\approx 44.2\\ \\mathrm{h}$. In clinical practice, plasma levels are monitored, and the rescue is terminated only after a measurement confirms that $C(t) < 0.1\\ \\mathrm{\\mu M}$. The calculated $t^\\ast$ provides the expected time for cessation of the rescue therapy.",
