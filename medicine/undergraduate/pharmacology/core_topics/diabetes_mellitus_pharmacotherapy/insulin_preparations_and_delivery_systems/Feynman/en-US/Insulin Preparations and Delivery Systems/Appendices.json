            "problem": "An individual with Type 1 diabetes mellitus receives a subcutaneous dose of lispro insulin delivered by an insulin pen. Assume a one-compartment pharmacokinetic model with a peripheral subcutaneous depot undergoing first-order absorption into the central compartment and first-order elimination from the central compartment. Let the amount of drug in the depot be $A_{d}(t)$ and the amount of drug in the central compartment be $A_{c}(t)$. Assume bioavailability $F=1$ (complete systemic availability from the depot), an initial bolus into the depot at time $t=0$ with $A_{d}(0)=F \\times D$, where $D$ is the administered dose, and $A_{c}(0)=0$. The governing mass-balance equations are\n$$\\frac{dA_{d}(t)}{dt}=-k_{a}A_{d}(t), \\qquad \\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt}=k_{a}A_{d}(t)-k_{e}A_{c}(t),$$\nand the plasma concentration is $C(t)=\\frac{A_{c}(t)}{V}$.

The one-compartment model with first-order absorption (Bateman model) is fundamental to pharmacokinetics, and the Emax model is a standard sigmoidal model used in pharmacodynamics. The parameter values provided are physiologically plausible for a rapid-acting insulin analogue like lispro, where absorption is faster than elimination ($k_a > k_e$). The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations with specified initial conditions. This constitutes a well-posed initial value problem, which has a unique and stable solution. All necessary parameters and constants are provided. The units are consistent, as long as the conversion from IU to mU is applied correctly.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and pharmacological language, free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first step is to solve the system of differential equations to find the amount of drug in the central compartment, $A_{c}(t)$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the amount of drug in the depot, $A_{d}(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{d}(t)}{dt}=-k_{a}A_{d}(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The solution is obtained by separation of variables and integration:\n$$ \\int \\frac{dA_d}{A_d} = \\int -k_a dt \\implies \\ln(A_d) = -k_a t + K' $$\n$$ A_d(t) = \\exp(-k_a t + K') = \\exp(K') \\exp(-k_a t) $$\nThe constant of integration is determined by the initial condition $A_{d}(0)$. Let $A_d(0) = \\exp(K')$.\nThe initial amount in the depot is given by $A_{d}(0) = F \\times D$. Since other parameters are given in terms of milliunits (mU), we use the dose in these units, $D_{\\text{mU}}=10000$ mU. With bioavailability $F=1$, we have:\n$$ A_{d}(0) = 1 \\times 10000 \\text{ mU} = 10000 \\text{ mU} $$\nThus, the expression for the amount of drug in the depot as a function of time is:\n$$ A_{d}(t) = 10000 \\exp(-k_{a}t) $$\n\nNext, we solve for the amount of drug in the central compartment, $A_{c}(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt}=k_{a}A_{d}(t)-k_{e}A_{c}(t) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{d}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt} = k_{a}(10000 \\exp(-k_{a}t)) - k_{e}A_{c}(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can write it in the standard form:\n$$ \\frac{dA_{c}(t)}{dt} + k_{e}A_{c}(t) = 10000k_{a} \\exp(-k_{a}t) $$\nTo solve this, we use an integrating factor, $I(t)$, defined as $I(t) = \\exp(\\int k_{e} dt) = \\exp(k_{e}t)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$:\n$$ \\exp(k_{e}t)\\frac{dA_c}{dt} + k_{e}\\exp(k_{e}t)A_c = 10000k_{a} \\exp(-k_{a}t)\\exp(k_{e}t) $$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}(A_c(t)\\exp(k_{e}t)) = 10000k_{a} \\exp((k_{e}-k_{a})t) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$ A_c(t)\\exp(k_{e}t) = \\int 10000k_{a} \\exp((k_{e}-k_{a})t) dt $$\nSince $k_a \\neq k_e$, the integral is:\n$$ A_c(t)\\exp(k_{e}t) = 10000k_{a} \\frac{\\exp((k_{e}-k_{a})t)}{k_{e}-k_{a}} + K $$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. Solving for $A_c(t)$:\n$$ A_c(t) = \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{e}-k_{a}} \\exp(-k_{a}t) + K\\exp(-k_{e}t) $$\nWe use the initial condition $A_{c}(0)=0$ to find $K$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{e}-k_{a}}\\exp(0) + K\\exp(0) \\implies K = -\\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{e}-k_{a}} = \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{a}-k_{e}} $$\nSubstituting $K$ back into the expression for $A_c(t)$:\n$$ A_c(t) = \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{e}-k_{a}} \\exp(-k_{a}t) + \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{a}-k_{e}} \\exp(-k_{e}t) $$\n$$ A_c(t) = \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{a}-k_{e}} (\\exp(-k_{e}t) - \\exp(-k_{a}t)) $$\n\nNow we can find the plasma concentration, $C(t)$, using the relation $C(t) = A_c(t)/V$.\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{1}{V} \\left[ \\frac{10000k_{a}}{k_{a}-k_{e}} (\\exp(-k_{e}t) - \\exp(-k_{a}t)) \\right] $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $k_{a}=0.08 \\text{ min}^{-1}$, $k_{e}=0.02 \\text{ min}^{-1}$, and $V=10$ L.\n$$ k_a - k_e = 0.08 - 0.02 = 0.06 \\text{ min}^{-1} $$\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\frac{10000 \\times 0.08}{0.06} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right] $$\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\frac{800}{0.06} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right] = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\frac{80000}{6} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right] $$\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left[ \\frac{40000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right] = \\frac{4000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) $$\nThe units for $C(t)$ are mU/L, with $t$ in minutes.\n\nFinally, we derive the glucose-lowering rate, $E(t)$, using the Emax model:\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{E_{\\text{max}}C(t)}{EC_{50}+C(t)} $$\nSubstituting the parameters $E_{\\text{max}}=10$ mg/dL/min, $EC_{50}=50$ mU/L, and the derived expression for $C(t)$:\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{10 \\left[ \\frac{4000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right]}{50 + \\left[ \\frac{4000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right]} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $3$:\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{3 \\times 10 \\left[ \\frac{4000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right]}{3 \\times 50 + 3 \\left[ \\frac{4000}{3} (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t)) \\right]} $$\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{10 \\times 4000 (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t))}{150 + 4000 (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t))} $$\n$$ E(t) = \\frac{40000 (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t))}{150 + 4000 (\\exp(-0.02t) - \\exp(-0.08t))} $$\nThe units for $E(t)$ are mg/dL/min, with $t$ in minutes.\n\nThe two required explicit closed-form functions of time $t$ are $C(t)$ and $E(t)$.",

            "problem": "A patient with Type 1 diabetes mellitus is transitioning from a rapid-acting $U$-$100$ insulin lispro pen to a concentrated $U$-$200$ insulin lispro pen. Insulins labeled $U$-$100$ and $U$-$200$ denote concentrations of $100\\,\\mathrm{units/mL}$ and $200\\,\\mathrm{units/mL}$, respectively. Standard insulin syringes calibrated in \"units\" are designed for $U$-$100$ insulin, where the $1$-\"unit\" mark corresponds to $0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The patient’s usual premeal parameters are: premeal blood glucose $150\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, target blood glucose $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) $20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit}$, and Insulin-to-Carbohydrate Ratio (ICR) $1\\,\\mathrm{unit} : 12\\,\\mathrm{g}$ carbohydrate.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity prior to attempting a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient diagnosis: Type $1$ diabetes mellitus.\n- Insulin transition: from a rapid-acting $U$-$100$ insulin lispro pen to a concentrated $U$-$200$ insulin lispro pen.\n- Insulin concentrations:\n  - $U$-$100$: $100\\,\\mathrm{units/mL}$.\n  - $U$-$200$: $200\\,\\mathrm{units/mL}$.\n- Syringe type: Standard insulin syringe calibrated for $U$-$100$ insulin.\n- Syringe calibration: $1$-\"unit\" mark corresponds to a volume of $0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Patient parameters:\n  - Premeal blood glucose: $150\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n  - Target blood glucose: $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n  - Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF): $20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit}$.\n  - Insulin-to-Carbohydrate Ratio (ICR): $1\\,\\mathrm{unit} : 12\\,\\mathrm{g}$ carbohydrate.\n- Meal plan: $36\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of carbohydrate.\n- Patient action: Draws insulin from the $U$-$200$ lispro pen into a $U$-$100$ syringe to the $4.5$-\"unit\" mark.\n- Patient intent: To deliver the total calculated premeal dose.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacology and diabetology. The concepts of insulin concentration ($U$-$100$, $U$-$200$), insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICR), and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) are standard in clinical practice. The patient data provided are internally consistent and realistic. For example, the definition of a $U$-$100$ syringe mark ($1$ mark = $0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) is consistent with the definition of $U$-$100$ insulin ($100\\,\\mathrm{units} = 1\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, so $1\\,\\mathrm{unit} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL}$). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the intended dose, the actual dose administered, and the resulting pharmacodynamic effect. The scenario describes a known, high-risk medication error, making the problem clinically relevant and objective. The problem is free of scientific unsoundness, ambiguity, and contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires a three-step analysis:\n1.  Calculate the correct, intended insulin dose for the patient's premeal situation.\n2.  Calculate the actual insulin dose administered due to the misuse of the syringe and concentrated insulin.\n3.  Predict the clinical consequence of the dosing error.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Intended Insulin Dose**\n\nThe total premeal dose is the sum of a correction dose (to lower elevated blood glucose to the target) and a meal dose (to cover the carbohydrate intake).\n\nThe correction dose is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Correction Dose} = \\frac{\\text{Current Glucose} - \\text{Target Glucose}}{\\text{ISF}} $$\n$$ \\text{Correction Dose} = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} - 120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}}{20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}}{20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit}} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{units} $$\n\nThe meal dose is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Meal Dose} = \\frac{\\text{Carbohydrate Intake}}{\\text{Carbohydrates per unit of insulin}} $$\n$$ \\text{Meal Dose} = \\frac{36\\,\\mathrm{g}}{12\\,\\mathrm{g/unit}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{units} $$\n\nThe total intended dose is the sum of these two components:\n$$ \\text{Total Intended Dose} = \\text{Correction Dose} + \\text{Meal Dose} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{units} + 3\\,\\mathrm{units} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{units} $$\nThis confirms that the patient's attempt to draw to the $4.5$-\"unit\" mark was based on the correct total dose calculation.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Actual Insulin Dose Administered**\n\nThe core error lies in confusing the \"unit\" marks on a syringe with the actual units of insulin when the concentration is mismatched. A $U$-$100$ syringe is a volumetric device, where each \"unit\" mark corresponds to the volume of $1$ unit of $U$-$100$ insulin.\n\nVolume per \"unit\" mark on a $U$-$100$ syringe:\n$$ \\text{Volume per mark} = \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{100\\,\\mathrm{units}} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL/mark} $$\nThe patient draws to the $4.5$-\"unit\" mark. The volume of insulin drawn is:\n$$ \\text{Volume Drawn} = 4.5\\,\\text{marks} \\times 0.01\\,\\mathrm{mL/mark} = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mL} $$\nThis volume was drawn from a $U$-$200$ insulin preparation, which has a concentration of $200\\,\\mathrm{units/mL}$. The actual number of insulin units administered is:\n$$ \\text{Actual Dose} = \\text{Volume Drawn} \\times \\text{Concentration} $$\n$$ \\text{Actual Dose} = 0.045\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times 200\\,\\mathrm{units/mL} = 9\\,\\mathrm{units} $$\n\n**3. Prediction of Clinical Consequence**\n\nThe patient administered $9\\,\\mathrm{units}$ of insulin instead of the intended $4.5\\,\\mathrm{units}$. This represents a $100\\%$ overdose, or a $2$-fold overdose.\n\nThe excess dose is:\n$$ \\text{Excess Dose} = \\text{Actual Dose} - \\text{Intended Dose} = 9\\,\\mathrm{units} - 4.5\\,\\mathrm{units} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{units} $$\nThe intended dose of $4.5\\,\\mathrm{units}$ was calculated to bring the patient's blood glucose to a target of $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ after the meal. The pharmacodynamic effect of the excess dose will further lower the blood glucose from this target.\n\nThe predicted drop in blood glucose from the excess dose is:\n$$ \\text{Glucose Drop from Excess} = \\text{Excess Dose} \\times \\text{ISF} $$\n$$ \\text{Glucose Drop from Excess} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{units} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit} = 90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\nThe predicted blood glucose nadir (lowest point) is the target glucose minus this additional drop:\n$$ \\text{Predicted Nadir} = \\text{Target Glucose} - \\text{Glucose Drop from Excess} $$\n$$ \\text{Predicted Nadir} = 120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} - 90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL} $$\nA blood glucose level of $30\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ constitutes severe, life-threatening hypoglycemia. This analysis demonstrates the extreme danger and non-interchangeability of concentrated insulins when used with standard syringes.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Because the pen mechanism delivers \"units\" independent of concentration, drawing to $4.5$ units with a $U$-$100$ syringe from a $U$-$200$ pen still yields the intended $4.5$ units; the expected postprandial blood glucose would remain near $120\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, indicating interchangeability without added risk.**\n- This option incorrectly assumes the patient used the pen's dialing mechanism. The problem states the patient drew insulin *from* the pen *into a syringe*. A $U$-$100$ syringe measures volume, not a concentration-independent dose. The dose delivered was $9\\,\\mathrm{units}$, not $4.5\\,\\mathrm{units}$. The conclusion of interchangeability is dangerously false.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. A $U$-$100$ syringe measure of $4.5$ units filled with $U$-$200$ lispro actually contains $9$ units, a $2$-fold overdose; with Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF) $=20\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL/unit}$, the extra $4.5$ units lowers glucose by $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ beyond target, predicting a nadir near $30\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, thereby demonstrating non-interchangeability and high risk.**\n- This option correctly identifies that drawing to the $4.5$-\"unit\" mark ($0.045\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) with $U$-$200$ insulin delivers $9\\,\\mathrm{units}$. It correctly terms this a $2$-fold overdose. It correctly calculates the excess dose as $4.5\\,\\mathrm{units}$ and the resulting glucose drop as $4.5 \\times 20 = 90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. It correctly predicts the nadir as $120 - 90 = 30\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The conclusion about non-interchangeability and high risk is fully supported by the analysis.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Concentrated $U$-$200$ insulin drawn to the $4.5$-unit mark delivers half the intended dose ($2.25$ units), causing underdosing and a postprandial blood glucose near $180\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$; the interchange is acceptable if doses are adjusted upward.**\n- This option inverts the logic of concentration. A more concentrated solution delivers *more*, not fewer, active units for a given volume. The dose administered was $9\\,\\mathrm{units}$, not $2.25\\,\\mathrm{units}$. The patient experienced an overdose, not an underdose. The entire premise and conclusion are flawed.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Volume differences between $U$-$100$ and $U$-$200$ alter absorption marginally but not units delivered; at most a $25\\%$ deviation in effect would occur, so the glucose nadir would be approximately $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, implying practical interchangeability.**\n- The statement that the \"units delivered\" are not altered is fundamentally false; this is the primary source of the error. The number of units delivered is doubled. While absorption characteristics might vary slightly due to depot volume, this effect is secondary and insignificant compared to the massive dosing error. The \"$25\\%$ deviation\" is an arbitrary and incorrect figure. The predicted nadir of $90\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ is incorrect, understating the severity. The conclusion of \"practical interchangeability\" is false and dangerous.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

Symbolically, if $C$ is grams of carbohydrate and $\\text{ICR}$ is grams per unit, then\n$$\nB_{\\text{carb}} \\;=\\; \\frac{C}{\\text{ICR}}.\n$$\n- Insulin Sensitivity Factor (ISF): If the ISF is $50$ mg/dL per unit, then the correction bolus before considering insulin on board (IOB) is proportional to the deviation of current glucose $G_{\\text{curr}}$ from target $G_{\\text{targ}}$, namely\n$$\nB_{\\text{corr,raw}} \\;=\\; \\frac{G_{\\text{curr}} - G_{\\text{targ}}}{\\text{ISF}}.\n$$\n- Insulin on Board (IOB): Residual active insulin from prior doses, computed over the Duration of Insulin Action (DIA). To avoid insulin stacking, we offset only the correction component by IOB. The net correction $B_{\\text{corr,net}}$ is\n$$\nB_{\\text{corr,net}} \\;=\\; \\max\\!\\big(0,\\; B_{\\text{corr,raw}} - \\text{IOB}\\big).\n$$\nThe total bolus $B_{\\text{total}}$ is then\n$$\nB_{\\text{total}} \\;=\\; B_{\\text{carb}} + B_{\\text{corr,net}}.\n$$\n\nApply the given values:\n- Carbohydrate grams: $C = 60$ g.\n- ICR: $\\text{ICR} = 10$ g/unit.\n- Current glucose: $G_{\\text{curr}} = 220$ mg/dL.\n- Target glucose: $G_{\\text{targ}} = 110$ mg/dL.\n- ISF: $\\text{ISF} = 50$ mg/dL per unit.\n- IOB: $\\text{IOB} = 2$ units.\n\nCompute the carbohydrate coverage:\n$$\nB_{\\text{carb}} \\;=\\; \\frac{60}{10} \\;=\\; 6.\n$$\n\nCompute the raw correction:\n$$\nB_{\\text{corr,raw}} \\;=\\; \\frac{220 - 110}{50} \\;=\\; \\frac{110}{50} \\;=\\; 2.2.\n$$\n\nOffset the correction by IOB and constrain at zero:\n$$\nB_{\\text{corr,net}} \\;=\\; \\max\\!\\big(0,\\; 2.2 - 2\\big) \\;=\\; \\max(0,\\; 0.2) \\;=\\; 0.2.\n$$\n\nSum components for total bolus:\n$$\nB_{\\text{total}} \\;=\\; 6 \\;+\\; 0.2 \\;=\\; 6.2.\n$$\n\nRounding instruction requires two significant figures. The value $6.2$ already has two significant figures, so the rounded result remains $6.2$. The recommended bolus, expressed in units (U) of rapid-acting insulin, is therefore $6.2$ U.",
