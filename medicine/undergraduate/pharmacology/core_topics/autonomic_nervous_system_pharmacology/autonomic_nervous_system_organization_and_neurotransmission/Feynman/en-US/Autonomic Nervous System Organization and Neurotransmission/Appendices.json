This exercise challenges you to quantitatively link the concentration of an agonist to its receptor occupancy, and then to a final cellular effect, demonstrating the critical—and often nonlinear—relationship between drug binding and signal transduction . Mastering this allows you to predict the functional consequences of drug-receptor interactions.",

            "problem": "A parasympathetic muscarinic agonist acts on cardiac sinoatrial (SA) node muscarinic type 2 receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Consider a single-site reversible binding scheme at steady state: a free receptor $R$ binds agonist $A$ to form the complex $AR$. The equilibrium dissociation constant is defined by the law of mass action as $K_D = \\frac{[R][A]}{[AR]}$. Let the total receptor concentration be $R_T = [R] + [AR]$. Define the fractional receptor occupancy as $r = \\frac{[AR]}{R_T}$. The bath agonist concentration is set to $[A] = 3K_D$.\n\nIn this tissue, signal amplification in the downstream pathway produces a nonlinear stimulus–response transduction such that the normalized effect is given by $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = r^{m}$, where $m = 2$ due to cooperative steps in signaling.\n\nUsing only the equilibrium definition of $K_D$, receptor conservation, and the given transduction relationship, determine the normalized physiological response $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$ when $[A] = 3K_D$. Express your final answer as an exact fraction with no units. Do not round.",
            "solution": "The goal is to calculate the normalized physiological response, $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}}$, which is related to the fractional receptor occupancy, $r$, by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = r^{m} $$\nGiven that the parameter $m = 2$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = r^{2} $$\nFirst, we must determine the fractional receptor occupancy, $r$, under the specified conditions. The fractional occupancy is defined as $r = \\frac{[AR]}{R_T}$. We are also given that the total receptor concentration is the sum of free and bound receptors: $R_T = [R] + [AR]$. Substituting this into the definition of $r$ gives:\n$$ r = \\frac{[AR]}{[R] + [AR]} $$\nTo express $r$ in terms of the agonist concentration $[A]$ and the dissociation constant $K_D$, we use the definition of $K_D$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[R][A]}{[AR]} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [AR]}{[A]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ back into the equation for $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{[AR]}{\\left(\\frac{K_D [AR]}{[A]}\\right) + [AR]} $$\nThe term $[AR]$ is common to both terms in the denominator, so we can factor it out:\n$$ r = \\frac{[AR]}{[AR] \\left(\\frac{K_D}{[A]} + 1\\right)} $$\nAssuming a response occurs, $[AR] \\neq 0$, so we can cancel $[AR]$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[A]} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and the denominator by $[A]$ simplifies this to the Hill-Langmuir equation:\n$$ r = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]} $$\nThe problem specifies that the agonist concentration is $[A] = 3K_D$. We substitute this condition into the equation for $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{3K_D}{K_D + 3K_D} = \\frac{3K_D}{4K_D} $$\nThe $K_D$ terms cancel, yielding the numerical value for the fractional occupancy:\n$$ r = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nFinally, we use this value of $r$ to calculate the normalized physiological response:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = r^{2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2} $$\nSquaring the fraction gives the final answer:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{3^2}{4^2} = \\frac{9}{16} $$",

            "problem": "A researcher is investigating the consequences of focal lesions to different autonomic efferent pathways. Patient 1 sustains a unilateral interruption of the right cervical sympathetic chain proximal to the superior cervical ganglion. Patient 2 undergoes a selective bilateral vagotomy at the level of the neck. Predict the organ-level effects in each patient at rest, and select the option that most plausibly matches the expected pattern across the following domains: pupil size, eyelid position, facial sweating and skin temperature, heart rate, bronchial tone and secretions, and gastrointestinal motility. Justify the differential outcomes based on the organization of efferent pathways and the identities of neurotransmitters released at target organs.\n\nWhich option best matches the expected findings?\n\nA.

Patient 2: Tachycardia; bronchodilation with reduced airway secretions; decreased gastrointestinal motility; no change in pupil size or sweating.\n\nB.

Patient 2: Tachycardia; bronchodilation; increased sweating; mydriasis; no change in gastrointestinal motility.",
            "solution": "Begin from foundational organization and neurotransmission principles of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS comprises sympathetic (thoracolumbar) and parasympathetic (craniosacral) divisions. Preganglionic neurons in both divisions release acetylcholine (ACh) acting on nicotinic receptors in autonomic ganglia. Sympathetic postganglionic neurons typically release norepinephrine (NE) acting on adrenergic receptors (for example, $\\alpha_1$, $\\alpha_2$, $\\beta_1$, $\\beta_2$), with a notable exception: sympathetic postganglionic fibers to eccrine sweat glands release ACh onto muscarinic receptors. Parasympathetic postganglionic neurons release ACh acting on muscarinic receptors (for example, $M_2$ in the heart, $M_3$ in smooth muscle and glands).\n\nApply pathway anatomy:\n\n1. Cervical sympathetic chain lesion proximal to the superior cervical ganglion interrupts sympathetic outflow to head structures on the ipsilateral side (pupil dilator muscle, superior tarsal muscle of the eyelid, facial sweat glands, cutaneous vasculature), and can reduce cardiac sympathetic efferent traffic traveling from upper thoracic segments ($T_1$-$T_5$) through cervical ganglia and plexuses. Expected consequences:\n   - Pupil: Loss of sympathetic input to the radial dilator muscle yields miosis (pupil constriction).\n   - Eyelid: Loss of sympathetic input to the superior tarsal (Müller’s) muscle causes mild ptosis.\n   - Sweating: Loss of sympathetic cholinergic input to facial sweat glands causes ipsilateral anhidrosis. Cutaneous vasodilation from loss of sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone may produce warm, flushed skin.\n   - Heart: Sympathetic activation via NE at $\\beta_1$-adrenergic receptors increases heart rate and contractility; removing that input tends to lower heart rate and contractility. At rest, parasympathetic tone via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) dominates, so the decrease is modest but directionally downward (relative bradycardia).\n   - Bronchi and gastrointestinal tract: These head-focused lesions do not directly remove parasympathetic vagal input to bronchi or gut; bronchial tone and GI motility are not increased by sympathetic loss and are largely unchanged in the absence of compensatory mechanisms.\n\n2. Bilateral vagotomy removes parasympathetic preganglionic ACh input to organs innervated by the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X), with prominent effects on the heart, airways, and gastrointestinal tract. Expected consequences:\n   - Heart: Loss of ACh at $M_2$ receptors in the sinoatrial node removes the dominant resting parasympathetic brake, causing tachycardia.\n   - Bronchi: Loss of ACh at $M_3$ receptors reduces bronchoconstriction and glandular secretions, leading to bronchodilation and decreased mucous secretion.\n   - Gastrointestinal tract: Parasympathetic activity promotes motility and secretion; its removal decreases motility and secretions.\n   - Pupils: Parasympathetic pupillary control travels via the oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III), not the vagus nerve; no direct pupillary effect is expected.\n   - Sweating: Sympathetic cholinergic control of sweat glands remains intact; no change expected.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Patient 1: Right miosis, mild ptosis, ipsilateral facial anhidrosis with warm flushed skin, modest decrease in resting heart rate. This matches the expected effects of a right cervical sympathetic chain lesion on head (Horner syndrome) and reduced cardiac sympathetic tone. Patient 2: Tachycardia from loss of parasympathetic $M_2$ input; bronchodilation with reduced secretions from loss of $M_3$ input; decreased gastrointestinal motility; no change in pupil size or sweating because these functions are not mediated by the vagus. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Patient 1: Right mydriasis and increased sweating imply increased sympathetic outflow, which contradicts a sympathetic chain lesion; increased heart rate also contradicts loss of $\\beta_1$-mediated cardiac stimulation. Patient 2: Bradycardia and bronchoconstriction would require intact or increased parasympathetic tone, which is removed by vagotomy; increased gastrointestinal motility likewise contradicts loss of parasympathetic drive. Decreased facial sweating bilaterally misattributes sweat gland control to the vagus rather than sympathetic cholinergic fibers. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Patient 1: Right miosis with facial anhidrosis is consistent, but the claim of increased resting heart rate “due to reflex compensation” is not supported as a direct effect of the lesion; removing sympathetic drive reduces, not increases, $\\beta_1$-mediated chronotropy. Patient 2: No change in heart rate is unlikely because loss of dominant vagal tone produces tachycardia; mydriasis is not expected because the vagus nerve does not control the pupil; bronchoconstriction and increased secretions are the opposite of the expected bronchodilation and reduced secretions after vagotomy; increased gastrointestinal motility contradicts loss of parasympathetic input. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Patient 1: No change in pupil or eyelid contradicts the hallmark head effects of sympathetic chain lesions; bilateral reduction in sweating contradicts the unilateral nature of the right-sided lesion. Bradycardia alone is insufficient and is mispaired with absent head signs. Patient 2: Tachycardia and bronchodilation are correct, but increased sweating and mydriasis are not mediated by the vagus; no change in gastrointestinal motility contradicts expected reductions. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the option that best integrates pathway anatomy and neurotransmitter identities is option A.",

            "problem": "A new investigational compound exhibits two actions relevant to autonomic control of the heart: it partially blocks the Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) and antagonizes the Muscarinic M2 receptor (M2). Model the synaptic norepinephrine concentration $[\\mathrm{NE}]$ in the cardiac sympathetic neuroeffector junction using a mass-balance steady state with first-order clearance dominated by NET, such that the steady state satisfies $r_{\\mathrm{NE}} = k_{\\mathrm{NET}} [\\mathrm{NE}]$, where $r_{\\mathrm{NE}}$ is the norepinephrine release rate and $k_{\\mathrm{NET}}$ is the first-order NET-mediated clearance constant.

The problem models the change in heart rate from the sympathetic system and the new absolute value of the parasympathetic reduction. The final heart rate can therefore be calculated as:\n$$H_1 = H_{\\mathrm{int}} + \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{symp}} - \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{M2},1}$$\nWhere $H_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is the intrinsic rate, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{symp}}$ is the change in heart rate from altered sympathetic activity, and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{M2},1}$ is the new magnitude of the parasympathetic rate reduction.
