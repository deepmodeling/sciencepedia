            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It describes a classical pharmacological scenario of competitive antagonism at a G protein-coupled receptor, using established principles and realistic parameters. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional receptor occupancy by atropine, denoted as $y$. The binding of the ligand (atropine, $L$) to the receptor ($R$) to form a receptor-ligand complex ($RL$) is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$ R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL $$\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, and the concentration of ligand-bound receptors, $[RL]$:\n$$ [R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL] $$\nThe fractional occupancy, $y$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are occupied by the ligand:\n$$ y = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]} $$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the concentrations of the reactants and products at equilibrium:\n$$ K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, in terms of the other species:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for fractional occupancy $y$:\n$$ y = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]} $$\nThe term $[RL]$ is present in the numerator and in both terms of the denominator, so it can be canceled out:\n$$ y = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$ y = \\frac{[L]}{[L]\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]} $$\nThis is the derived expression for fractional receptor occupancy, also known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site.\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical value of the fractional occupancy. The problem provides the following values:\nFree ligand (atropine) concentration: $[L] = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nEquilibrium dissociation constant for atropine: $K_d = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$ y = \\frac{0.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{1\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 0.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}} = \\frac{0.3}{1.3} $$\nCalculating the value:\n$$ y \\approx 0.2307692... $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$ y \\approx 0.231 $$\nThis means that at equilibrium, approximately $23.1\\%$ of the muscarinic type $3$ receptors are occupied by atropine.\n\nThe final task is to explain qualitatively how this level of atropine occupancy impacts acetylcholine-induced contractile responses. Atropine is a competitive antagonist. This means it binds reversibly to the same active site on the muscarinic receptor as the endogenous agonist, acetylcholine (ACh), but it does not activate the receptor. By occupying the receptor, it prevents ACh from binding and initiating the signaling cascade ($G_q$ activation, increase in intracellular calcium, and bronchoconstriction).\n\n1.  **Impact on Potency**: With a significant fraction of receptors ($23.1\\%$) occupied by the antagonist atropine, a higher concentration of the agonist ACh is required to achieve a given level of response (e.g., $50\\%$ of maximal contraction). The ACh must \"outcompete\" the atropine for a sufficient number of available receptor binding sites. This competition results in a rightward, parallel shift of the concentration-response curve for acetylcholine. A rightward shift signifies a decrease in the potency of the agonist. Therefore, in the presence of this concentration of atropine, the potency of acetylcholine is reduced.\n\n2.  **Impact on Maximal Effect**: Because the antagonism is competitive (and thus surmountable), the effect of the antagonist can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the agonist. If a sufficiently high concentration of acetylcholine is administered, it can displace all bound atropine molecules from the receptors and eventually occupy enough receptors to produce the same maximal response ($E_{\\max}$) as in the absence of the antagonist. Therefore, a competitive antagonist like atropine does not reduce the maximal effect of acetylcholine. The maximal contractile response is unchanged, provided a high enough concentration of acetylcholine can be applied.\n\nIn summary, the presence of atropine at a concentration of $0.3\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ results in a $23.1\\%$ receptor occupancy, which leads to a decrease in acetylcholine's potency for inducing bronchoconstriction but does not alter the maximal possible contractile response.",

It accurately describes the experimental setup for determining the potency of a competitive antagonist (atropine, a known muscarinic antagonist) against an agonist (carbachol, a known muscarinic agonist) at a relevant physiological receptor ($M_3$ receptors in bronchial smooth muscle). The underlying model, the Gaddum-Schild equation, is a fundamental principle of receptor theory. The data values are pharmacologically plausible.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and assumptions to arrive at a unique solution. The objective is clearly stated, and the method (linear regression of transformed data) is specified.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard pharmacological terminology (e.g., $EC_{50}$, competitive antagonism, $K_B$, $pA_2$). There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n**Action:** Proceed with the detailed solution.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the antagonist potency index, $pA_2$, from concentration-response data in a competitive antagonism experiment. This is accomplished using the Schild analysis.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation. For a simple competitive antagonism at equilibrium, where an agonist $A$ and a competitive antagonist $B$ compete for the same receptor site $R$, the law of mass action applies. The equilibrium dissociation constants for the agonist and antagonist are $K_A$ and $K_B$, respectively. The fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist, $P_A$, in the presence of both ligands is given by:\n$$P_A = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)}$$\nwhere $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the concentrations of the agonist and antagonist.\n\nThe half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$) is the agonist concentration required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximal response. Assuming the response is a function of receptor occupancy, a specific level of occupancy corresponds to the $50\\%$ response level. In the absence of antagonist ($[B]=0$), the equation simplifies, and the agonist concentration required for a given effect is proportional to $K_A$. We denote this concentration as $EC_{50,0}$.\n\nIn the presence of the antagonist at concentration $[B]$, the agonist concentration required to achieve the same level of receptor occupancy (and thus the same effect) is increased. This new concentration is the shifted $EC_{50}$, denoted $EC_{50,[B]}$. By comparing the agonist binding terms in the denominator of the occupancy equation, we can see that the apparent affinity of the agonist is reduced by a factor of $\\left(1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}\\right)$. Therefore, the $EC_{50}$ is shifted by this same factor:\n$$EC_{50,[B]} = EC_{50,0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B} \\right)$$\nThe ratio of the shifted $EC_{50}$ to the control $EC_{50}$ is defined as the dose ratio ($DR$):\n$$DR = \\frac{EC_{50,[B]}}{EC_{50,0}} = 1 + \\frac{[B]}{K_B}$$\nThis is the Gaddum-Schild equation. To linearize this relationship for regression analysis, we rearrange it as:\n$$DR - 1 = \\frac{[B]}{K_B}$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides yields the Schild plot equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(DR - 1) = \\log_{10}([B]) - \\log_{10}(K_B)$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- $y = \\log_{10}(DR - 1)$\n- $x = \\log_{10}([B])$\n- The theoretical slope is $m=1$.\n- The intercept on the y-axis is $c = -\\log_{10}(K_B)$.\n\nThe problem requires us to perform a least-squares linear regression on the transformed data. First, we must process the given data. All concentrations are converted to molar units ($1\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$).\n\nThe control agonist potency is $EC_{50,0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nThe experimental data points are:\n1.  $[B]_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$; $EC_{50,[B],1} = 5.50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n2.  $[B]_2 = 10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$; $EC_{50,[B],2} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n3.  $[B]_3 = 100.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$; $EC_{50,[B],3} = 55.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 5.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\nNext, we calculate the dose ratio ($DR$) and transform the variables for each data point.\n1.  $DR_1 = \\frac{5.50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}} = 1.10$\n    $x_1 = \\log_{10}(1.0 \\times 10^{-9}) = -9.0$\n    $y_1 = \\log_{10}(DR_1 - 1) = \\log_{10}(1.10 - 1) = \\log_{10}(0.10) = -1.0$\n2.  $DR_2 = \\frac{10.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}} = 2.00$\n    $x_2 = \\log_{10}(1.0 \\times 10^{-8}) = -8.0$\n    $y_2 = \\log_{10}(DR_2 - 1) = \\log_{10}(2.00 - 1) = \\log_{10}(1.0) = 0.0$\n3.  $DR_3 = \\frac{55.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}} = 11.0$\n    $x_3 = \\log_{10}(1.0 \\times 10^{-7}) = -7.0$\n    $y_3 = \\log_{10}(DR_3 - 1) = \\log_{10}(11.0 - 1) = \\log_{10}(10.0) = 1.0$\n\nThe transformed data points for regression are $(-9.0, -1.0)$, $(-8.0, 0.0)$, and $(-7.0, 1.0)$.\nWe perform a least-squares linear regression for the line $y=mx+c$. The number of data points is $N=3$.\nThe means are $\\bar{x} = \\frac{-9.0 - 8.0 - 7.0}{3} = -8.0$ and $\\bar{y} = \\frac{-1.0 + 0.0 + 1.0}{3} = 0.0$.\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as:\n$$m = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n$$m = \\frac{(-9.0 - (-8.0))(-1.0 - 0.0) + (-8.0 - (-8.0))(0.0 - 0.0) + (-7.0 - (-8.0))(1.0 - 0.0)}{(-9.0 - (-8.0))^2 + (-8.0 - (-8.0))^2 + (-7.0 - (-8.0))^2}$$\n$$m = \\frac{(-1.0)(-1.0) + (0)(0) + (1.0)(1.0)}{(-1.0)^2 + 0^2 + (1.0)^2} = \\frac{1.0 + 1.0}{1.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{2.0}{2.0} = 1.0$$\nThe slope is exactly $1$, which is consistent with the theoretical model for simple competitive antagonism.\nThe y-intercept $c$ is calculated as:\n$$c = \\bar{y} - m\\bar{x} = 0.0 - (1.0)(-8.0) = 8.0$$\nThe equation of the regression line is $y = 1.0x + 8.0$.\nComparing this empirical equation to the theoretical Schild equation, $y = x - \\log_{10}(K_B)$, we equate the intercept terms:\n$$c = 8.0 = -\\log_{10}(K_B)$$\nThe problem defines the antagonist potency index as $pA_{2} \\equiv -\\log_{10}(K_{B}/(1\\,\\mathrm{M}))$. Since we performed all calculations with concentrations in molar units, the calculated $K_B$ is implicitly in molar units. Therefore, the term $K_B/(1\\,\\mathrm{M})$ is numerically equal to $K_B$.\nThus, $pA_2 = -\\log_{10}(K_B)$.\nFrom our regression, we have found that $-\\log_{10}(K_B) = 8.0$.\nTherefore, $pA_2 = 8.0$.\n\nAlternatively, the $pA_2$ value is the negative logarithm of the molar concentration of antagonist that produces a dose ratio of $2$. A dose ratio of $DR=2$ corresponds to $y=\\log_{10}(2-1)=0$. The x-intercept of the Schild plot represents $\\log_{10}(K_B)$. However, a more common interpretation of the plot relates $pA_2$ to the x-intercept of the regression line $y=mx+c$. Setting $y=0$, we get $0 = (1.0)x + 8.0$, which yields $x = -8.0$. This x-value is $\\log_{10}([B])$ when $DR=2$. So, $\\log_{10}([B]_{\\mathrm{for\\,DR=2}}) = -8.0$, meaning $[B]_{\\mathrm{for\\,DR=2}} = 10^{-8.0}\\,\\mathrm{M}$. The $pA_2$ is the negative of this logarithm: $pA_2 = -(-8.0) = 8.0$.\n\nThe final result is $pA_2 = 8.0$. The problem requests the answer rounded to three significant figures.\n\n$$pA_2 = 8.00$$",

The net fractional change in contractility, $\\Delta I_{\\text{frac}}$, is the sum of the individual fractional effects from each receptor, $E_r^{(\\mathrm{inot})}$.\n\nFor the $\\beta_1$ receptor's effect on inotropy: $s_{\\beta_1}=+1$, $E_{\\max,\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = 0.60$, $\\theta_{\\beta_1} = 0.6$, and $w_{\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = 1.00$.\n$$ E_{\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = (+1) \\times E_{\\max,\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} \\times \\theta_{\\beta_1} \\times w_{\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = (+1) \\times 0.60 \\times 0.6 \\times 1.00 = 0.36 $$\n\nFor the $M_2$ receptor's effect on inotropy: $s_{M_2}=-1$, $E_{\\max,M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = 0.20$, $\\theta_{M_2} = 2/3$, and $w_{M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = 0.30$.\n$$ E_{M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = (-1) \\times E_{\\max,M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} \\times \\theta_{M_2} \\times w_{M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = (-1) \\times 0.20 \\times \\frac{2}{3} \\times 0.30 = (-1) \\times 0.06 \\times \\frac{2}{3} = -0.04 $$\n\nThe net fractional change in contractility is the sum of these effects:\n$$ \\Delta I_{\\text{frac}} = E_{\\beta_1}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} + E_{M_2}^{(\\mathrm{inot})} = 0.36 + (-0.04) = 0.32 $$\n\nThe final contractility index, $I_{\\mathrm{final}}$, is calculated from the baseline index $I_0 = 1.00$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{final}} = I_0 \\times (1 + \\Delta I_{\\text{frac}}) = 1.00 \\times (1 + 0.32) = 1.32 $$\nThis value is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(H_{\\mathrm{final}}, I_{\\mathrm{final}})$.",
