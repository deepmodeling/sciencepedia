A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe fundamental definition of total systemic clearance ($CL$) for a drug administered as an intravenous bolus, under the assumption of linear pharmacokinetics, is the ratio of the administered dose ($D$) to the total Area Under the concentration-time Curve from time zero to infinity ($AUC_{0-\\infty}$).\n$$CL = \\frac{D}{AUC_{0-\\infty}}$$\nThe total AUC is calculated by summing the AUC from time $t=0$ to the last measured time point, $t_{last}$, and the extrapolated area from $t_{last}$ to infinity.\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty} = AUC_{0-t_{last}} + AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty}$$\nThe term $AUC_{0-t_{last}}$ is calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. For two consecutive data points $(t_i, C_i)$ and $(t_{i+1}, C_{i+1})$, the area of the trapezoid is:\n$$AUC_{t_i-t_{i+1}} = \\frac{C_i + C_{i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i)$$\nThe total area $AUC_{0-t_{last}}$ is the sum of these individual trapezoidal areas.\n\n**1. Calculation for the Dense Sampling Design**\n\nThe data points are $(0, 20.0)$, $(0.25, 17.0)$, $(0.5, 14.5)$, $(1, 11.0)$, $(2, 8.0)$, $(4, 5.0)$, $(8, 2.2466)$, and $(12, 1.00948)$. The last time point is $t_{last} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n$AUC_{0-12, \\text{dense}}$ is calculated as the sum of the areas of the trapezoids:\n- $AUC_{0-0.25} = \\frac{20.0 + 17.0}{2} \\times (0.25 - 0) = 4.625$\n- $AUC_{0.25-0.5} = \\frac{17.0 + 14.5}{2} \\times (0.5 - 0.25) = 3.9375$\n- $AUC_{0.5-1} = \\frac{14.5 + 11.0}{2} \\times (1 - 0.5) = 6.375$\n- $AUC_{1-2} = \\frac{11.0 + 8.0}{2} \\times (2 - 1) = 9.5$\n- $AUC_{2-4} = \\frac{8.0 + 5.0}{2} \\times (4 - 2) = 13.0$\n- $AUC_{4-8} = \\frac{5.0 + 2.2466}{2} \\times (8 - 4) = 14.4932$\n- $AUC_{8-12} = \\frac{2.2466 + 1.00948}{2} \\times (12 - 8) = 6.51216$\n\nSumming these values gives the area from $t=0$ to $t=12$:\n$$AUC_{0-12, \\text{dense}} = 4.625 + 3.9375 + 6.375 + 9.5 + 13.0 + 14.4932 + 6.51216 = 58.44286 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\n**2. Calculation for the Sparse Sampling Design**\n\nThe data points are $(0, 20.0)$, $(1, 11.0)$, $(4, 5.0)$, $(8, 2.2466)$, and $(12, 1.00948)$. The last time point is also $t_{last} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n$AUC_{0-12, \\text{sparse}}$ is calculated as:\n- $AUC_{0-1} = \\frac{20.0 + 11.0}{2} \\times (1 - 0) = 15.5$\n- $AUC_{1-4} = \\frac{11.0 + 5.0}{2} \\times (4 - 1) = 24.0$\n- $AUC_{4-8} = \\frac{5.0 + 2.2466}{2} \\times (8 - 4) = 14.4932$\n- $AUC_{8-12} = \\frac{2.2466 + 1.00948}{2} \\times (12 - 8) = 6.51216$\n\nSumming these values:\n$$AUC_{0-12, \\text{sparse}} = 15.5 + 24.0 + 14.4932 + 6.51216 = 60.50536 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\n**3. Estimation of the Terminal Elimination Rate Constant ($\\lambda_z$)**\n\nThe constant $\\lambda_z$ is estimated from the slope of the regression of $\\ln(C)$ versus $t$ for the last three data points, which are common to both designs: $(4, 5.0)$, $(8, 2.2466)$, and $(12, 1.00948)$.\nThe relationship is $\\ln(C(t)) = \\ln(C_{\\text{intercept}}) - \\lambda_z t$. Thus, the slope of the line is $-\\lambda_z$.\nLet's take the natural logarithms of the concentrations:\n- For $t=4$: $\\ln(5.0) \\approx 1.609438$\n- For $t=8$: $\\ln(2.2466) \\approx 0.809419$\n- For $t=12$: $\\ln(1.00948) \\approx 0.009435$\nThe slope of the line connecting any two of these points can be computed. For instance, between $t=4$ and $t=12$:\n$$ \\text{slope} = \\frac{\\ln(1.00948) - \\ln(5.0)}{12 - 4} = \\frac{0.009435 - 1.609438}{8} = \\frac{-1.600003}{8} \\approx -0.200000 $$\nThe data points lie perfectly on a log-linear line, so a regression is not strictly necessary. The slope is $-0.20000$.\nTherefore, the terminal elimination rate constant is:\n$$\\lambda_z = 0.20000 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\n**4. Calculation of the Extrapolated Area ($AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty}$)**\n\nThe extrapolated area is calculated as $AUC_{t_{last}-\\infty} = \\frac{C_{last}}{\\lambda_z}$, where $C_{last}$ is the last measured concentration. For both designs, $t_{last} = 12\\,\\mathrm{h}$ and $C_{last} = 1.00948\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n$$AUC_{12-\\infty} = \\frac{1.00948\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{0.20000\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}} = 5.0474 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n\n**5. Calculation of Total AUC and Systemic Clearance (CL)**\n\nFor each design, we now compute the total AUC and the corresponding clearance.\n\n**Dense Design:**\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{dense}} = AUC_{0-12, \\text{dense}} + AUC_{12-\\infty} = 58.44286 + 5.0474 = 63.49026 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n$$CL_{\\text{dense}} = \\frac{D}{AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{dense}}} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{63.49026\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}} \\approx 4.72512 \\, \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\n**Sparse Design:**\n$$AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{sparse}} = AUC_{0-12, \\text{sparse}} + AUC_{12-\\infty} = 60.50536 + 5.0474 = 65.55276 \\, \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$$\n$$CL_{\\text{sparse}} = \\frac{D}{AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{sparse}}} = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{65.55276\\,\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{h}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}} \\approx 4.57685 \\, \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\n**6. Calculation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R = CL_{\\text{dense}}/CL_{\\text{sparse}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{CL_{\\text{dense}}}{CL_{\\text{sparse}}} = \\frac{D/AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{dense}}}{D/AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{sparse}}} = \\frac{AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{sparse}}}{AUC_{0-\\infty, \\text{dense}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated total AUC values:\n$$R = \\frac{65.55276}{63.49026} \\approx 1.0324855$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.032$.",

At baseline, the patient’s hepatic blood flow is $1.50$ L/min, the unbound fraction is $0.20$, and the intrinsic clearance is $5.00$ L/min.

The parameters ($Q_h$, $f_u$, $CL_{int}$) are fundamental to this model.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary initial values and relationships to calculate the requested quantities.

The values are physiologically plausible.\n    -   It is not trivial, as it requires the correct application of the well-stirred model equations and an understanding of steady-state kinetics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis is based on the well-stirred liver model. The fundamental equations for this model are:\nThe hepatic clearance, $CL_h$, is a function of hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$, and the hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$:\n$$CL_h = Q_h \\cdot E_h$$\nThe hepatic extraction ratio, $E_h$, is defined by the relationship between hepatic blood flow and the unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u}$:\n$$E_h = \\frac{CL_{int, u}}{Q_h + CL_{int, u}}$$\nUnbound intrinsic clearance is the product of the total intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$, and the unbound fraction of the drug in plasma, $f_u$:\n$$CL_{int, u} = f_u \\cdot CL_{int}$$\nCombining these equations gives the comprehensive formula for hepatic clearance in the well-stirred model:\n$$CL_h = Q_h \\cdot \\frac{f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}} = \\frac{Q_h \\cdot f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u \\cdot CL_{int}}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the parameters for the new clinical state.\nThe baseline parameters are:\n$Q_{h, \\text{base}} = 1.50$ L/min\n$f_{u, \\text{base}} = 0.20$\n$CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 5.00$ L/min\n\nThe new parameters are calculated as follows:\nNew hepatic blood flow, $Q_{h, \\text{new}}$:\n$$Q_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.70 \\times Q_{h, \\text{base}} = 0.70 \\times 1.50 \\text{ L/min} = 1.05 \\text{ L/min}$$\nNew unbound fraction, $f_{u, \\text{new}}$:\n$$f_{u, \\text{new}} = 1.50 \\times f_{u, \\text{base}} = 1.50 \\times 0.20 = 0.30$$\nNew intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{int, \\text{new}} = 0.60 \\times CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 0.60 \\times 5.00 \\text{ L/min} = 3.00 \\text{ L/min}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the new unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{new}} = f_{u, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{int, \\text{new}} = 0.30 \\times 3.00 \\text{ L/min} = 0.90 \\text{ L/min}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the new hepatic clearance, $CL_{h, \\text{new}}$:\n$$CL_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{Q_{h, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}{Q_{h, \\text{new}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}$$\n$$CL_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{1.05 \\text{ L/min} \\times 0.90 \\text{ L/min}}{1.05 \\text{ L/min} + 0.90 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{0.945}{1.95} \\text{ L/min} \\approx 0.484615... \\text{ L/min}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the new hepatic clearance is $CL_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.4846$ L/min.\n\nNext, we calculate the new hepatic extraction ratio, $E_{h, \\text{new}}$. We can use its definition:\n$$E_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}{Q_{h, \\text{new}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{new}}}$$\n$$E_{h, \\text{new}} = \\frac{0.90 \\text{ L/min}}{1.05 \\text{ L/min} + 0.90 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{0.90}{1.95} \\approx 0.461538...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the new hepatic extraction ratio is $E_{h, \\text{new}} = 0.4615$.\n\nFinally, we determine the adjustment factor for the IV maintenance dose rate, $R_0$. At steady state, the dose rate is equal to the elimination rate:\n$$R_0 = C_{ss,avg} \\cdot CL_T$$\nwhere $C_{ss,avg}$ is the average steady-state plasma concentration and $CL_T$ is the total body clearance. Since the drug is cleared exclusively by the liver, $CL_T = CL_h$.\nThe goal is to maintain the same $C_{ss,avg}$ as at baseline.\n$$C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}}$$\nThe relationships for the two states are:\n$$R_{0, \\text{base}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{base}}$$\n$$R_{0, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{new}}$$\nThe required adjustment factor is the ratio $\\frac{R_{0, \\text{new}}}{R_{0, \\text{base}}}$.\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{R_{0, \\text{new}}}{R_{0, \\text{base}}} = \\frac{C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{new}}}{C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{h, \\text{base}}}$$\nSince $C_{ss,avg, \\text{new}} = C_{ss,avg, \\text{base}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{CL_{h, \\text{new}}}{CL_{h, \\text{base}}}$$\nWe need to calculate the baseline hepatic clearance, $CL_{h, \\text{base}}$. First, we find the baseline unbound intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}$:\n$$CL_{int, u, \\text{base}} = f_{u, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{int, \\text{base}} = 0.20 \\times 5.00 \\text{ L/min} = 1.00 \\text{ L/min}$$\nNow, we calculate $CL_{h, \\text{base}}$:\n$$CL_{h, \\text{base}} = \\frac{Q_{h, \\text{base}} \\cdot CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}}{Q_{h, \\text{base}} + CL_{int, u, \\text{base}}} = \\frac{1.50 \\text{ L/min} \\times 1.00 \\text{ L/min}}{1.50 \\text{ L/min} + 1.00 \\text{ L/min}} = \\frac{1.50}{2.50} \\text{ L/min} = 0.600 \\text{ L/min}$$\nThe adjustment factor is therefore:\n$$\\text{Adjustment Factor} = \\frac{0.484615... \\text{ L/min}}{0.600 \\text{ L/min}} \\approx 0.807692...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the adjustment factor is $0.8077$.\n\nThe three requested values are:\n1.  New $CL_h = 0.4846$ L/min\n2.  New $E_h = 0.4615$\n3.  IV maintenance dose rate adjustment factor = $0.8077$",
