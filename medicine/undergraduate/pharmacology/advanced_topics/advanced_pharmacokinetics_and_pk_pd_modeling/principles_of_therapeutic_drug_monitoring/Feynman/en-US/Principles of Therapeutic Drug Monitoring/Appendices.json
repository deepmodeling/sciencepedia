The principles provided (mass balance, clearance, bioavailability, volume of distribution) are the cornerstones of this field. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($CL$, $V_d$, $F$, $\\tau$, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$) to calculate the two requested quantities, the maintenance dose and the loading dose.

It is not trivial, as it requires derivation from first principles. It is not unrealistic, ill-posed, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived from the specified first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Calculation\n\n**1) Maintenance Dose ($D_M$)**\n\nThe maintenance dose, $D_M$, is the dose given at each interval $\\tau$ to maintain the target average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$. We begin with the principle of mass balance at steady state.\n\nAccording to the first principle, at steady state, the average rate of drug entry into the systemic circulation must equal the average rate of drug elimination from the body.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}} $$\n\nThe average rate of drug entry, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}}$, is determined by the maintenance dose $D_M$, its bioavailability $F$, and the dosing interval $\\tau$. For an oral dose $D_M$ administered every $\\tau$ hours, the fraction $F$ of the dose reaches the systemic circulation. The average rate at which the drug enters the systemic circulation is therefore the total bioavailable amount per interval divided by the length of the interval.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{in,avg}} = \\frac{F \\times D_M}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe average rate of drug elimination, $\\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}}$, is related to clearance, $CL$, and the average steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$. According to the second principle, clearance is the proportionality constant relating the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out}}(t) = CL \\times C(t) $$\nSince clearance $CL$ is assumed to be constant, the average rate of elimination over a long period is the clearance multiplied by the average concentration during that period. At steady state, this is $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$.\n$$ \\text{Rate}_{\\text{out,avg}} = CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nEquating the average rates of entry and elimination:\n$$ \\frac{F \\times D_M}{\\tau} = CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the maintenance dose, $D_M$:\n$$ D_M = \\frac{CL \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} \\times \\tau}{F} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $CL = 3.7~\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = 5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $\\tau = 8.0~\\mathrm{h}$\n- $F = 0.55$\n\n$$ D_M = \\frac{(3.7~\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}) \\times (8.0~\\mathrm{h})}{0.55} $$\n$$ D_M = \\frac{148}{0.55}~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 269.0909...~\\mathrm{mg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the maintenance dose is $D_M = 269~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\n**2) Loading Dose ($D_L$)**\n\nA loading dose, $D_L$, is a single, larger initial dose given to rapidly achieve a therapeutic amount of drug in the body, bypassing the slow accumulation that occurs with maintenance dosing. The goal is to \"fill\" the apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, to the target concentration. The problem asks for a dose that places the body's amount of drug at the level consistent with the target concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$, once absorbed.\n\nAccording to the fourth principle, the apparent volume of distribution, $V_d$, relates the amount of drug in the body, $A$, to the plasma concentration, $C$.\n$$ A = V_d \\times C $$\nThe target amount of drug in the body, $A_{\\mathrm{target}}$, that corresponds to the target average steady-state concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}$ is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{target}} = V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nThe loading dose, $D_L$, is the administered dose required to achieve this target amount in the body. Since the drug is given orally, we must account for its bioavailability, $F$, as per the third principle. The amount of drug that actually reaches the systemic circulation after the loading dose is $F \\times D_L$. This absorbed amount must equal the target amount in the body.\n$$ F \\times D_L = A_{\\mathrm{target}} $$\n\nCombining the two equations:\n$$ F \\times D_L = V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} $$\n\nWe can now solve for the loading dose, $D_L$:\n$$ D_L = \\frac{V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}}}{F} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $V_d = 140~\\mathrm{L}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{ss,avg}} = 5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $F = 0.55$\n\n$$ D_L = \\frac{(140~\\mathrm{L}) \\times (5.0~\\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})}{0.55} $$\n$$ D_L = \\frac{700}{0.55}~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 1272.7272...~\\mathrm{mg} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the loading dose is $D_L = 1270~\\mathrm{mg}$, which can be expressed as $1.27 \\times 10^{3}~\\mathrm{mg}$ to show the significance unambiguously.\n\nThe final calculated values are:\n- Maintenance Dose: $269~\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Loading Dose: $1270~\\mathrm{mg}$ (or $1.27 \\times 10^{3}~\\mathrm{mg}$)",

Let the elimination rate constant be $k$, and the elimination half-life be $t_{1/2}$, with the fundamental relationship $k = (\\ln 2)/t_{1/2}$. The patient has $t_{1/2} = 17$ hours.

The solution requires deriving the time course of trough concentrations, determining the steady-state limit, and solving for the time at which the specified deviation is met.\n\nThe drug follows a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and instantaneous absorption. The concentration $C(t)$ following a single intravenous bolus dose $D$ at time $t=0$ is given by:\n$$\nC(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt) = \\frac{D}{V_D} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the elimination rate constant, $V_D$ is the volume of distribution, and $C_0$ is the initial concentration at $t=0$.\n\nA fixed dose is administered every $\\tau = 24$ hours. We can use the principle of superposition to find the trough concentration at time $t = N\\tau$ (i.e., immediately before the $(N+1)$-th dose, where doses are indexed starting from $N=0$ for the first dose at $t=0$).

The sum is given by $\\frac{r^N - 1}{r - 1} = \\frac{\\exp(kN\\tau) - 1}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C_{T}(N\\tau)$:\n$$\nC_{T}(N\\tau) = C_p \\exp(-kN\\tau) \\frac{\\exp(kN\\tau) - 1}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1} = C_p \\frac{1 - \\exp(-kN\\tau)}{\\exp(k\\tau) - 1}\n$$\nTo obtain a more standard form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(-k\\tau)$:\n$$\nC_{T}(N\\tau) = C_p \\frac{\\exp(-k\\tau)(1 - \\exp(-kN\\tau))}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}\n$$\nLet's denote the time of the N-th trough measurement as $t = N\\tau$.

A system is linear if it adheres to the principle of superposition. This means that if an input stimulus is scaled by a factor, the system's response is scaled by the same factor. In this context, the administered drug dose, $D$, is the input, and the resulting plasma drug concentration over time, $C(t)$, is the response.\n\nLet the function $C_{\\text{ss}}(t; D)$ represent the drug concentration at time $t$ within a dosing interval at steady state, for a maintenance dose $D$ administered every interval $\\tau$. The problem states that the system is linear. Therefore, scaling the input dose from $D$ to a new dose $\\alpha D$ will scale the entire steady-state concentration profile by the same factor $\\alpha$:\n$$C_{\\text{ss}}(t; \\alpha D) = \\alpha \\cdot C_{\\text{ss}}(t; D)$$\nThis relationship holds for all points in time $t$ during the dosing interval, including the specific time at which the trough concentration is measured. The steady-state trough concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,min}}$, is the minimum concentration observed during the dosing interval at steady state, typically measured immediately before the administration of the next dose.\n\nGiven this direct proportionality, we can establish a relationship between two different dosing regimens (regimen $1$ and regimen $2$) where only the dose is changed, while all other pharmacokinetic parameters ($F$, $V_d$, $k_a$, $k_e$) and the dosing interval $\\tau$ remain constant.\n\nLet $D_1$ be the initial maintenance dose and $C_{\\text{ss,min,1}}$ be the measured steady-state trough concentration for this dose.\nLet $D_2$ be the new, adjusted maintenance dose and $C_{\\text{ss,min,2}}$ be the target steady-state trough concentration.\n\nBased on the principle of linearity, we can write:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min,1}} = k \\cdot D_1$$\n$$C_{\\text{ss,min,2}} = k \\cdot D_2$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality that depends on the patient's specific pharmacokinetic parameters and the dosing interval.
