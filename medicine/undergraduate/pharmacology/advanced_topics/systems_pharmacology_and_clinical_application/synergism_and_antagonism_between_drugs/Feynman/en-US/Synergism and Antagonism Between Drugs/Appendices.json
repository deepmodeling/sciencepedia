This method calculates a dimensionless value known as the Combination Index (CI). The CI provides a quantitative definition for synergism (CI < 1), additive effect (CI = 1), and antagonism (CI > 1) in drug combinations.\n\nA research team is investigating a potential new combination therapy for a specific type of cell line.

This practice simulates a common task in drug development, where researchers must determine if a new combination is synergistic, additive, or antagonistic.

            "problem": "A translational pharmacology team is designing a two-drug combination therapy targeting an oncogenic signaling pathway in a preclinical model. The response to each single agent is assumed to obey the mass-action-derived median-effect principle, which implies monotonic dose–effect relationships for each drug and defines, for any fractional effect level $x \\in (0,1)$, the single-agent dose $D_{A,x}$ (respectively $D_{B,x}$) as the dose of drug $A$ (respectively drug $B$) that yields the fraction affected $x$ when administered alone. Under the framework of Loewe additivity and mutual exclusivity (no overlapping binding sites or independent mechanisms that do not produce synergism by themselves), the Chou–Talalay Combination Index (CI) is used to quantify deviation from additivity at a specified effect level $x$, with $CI=1$ corresponding to additivity, $CI<1$ indicating synergy, and $CI>1$ indicating antagonism. \n\nFor a target fractional effect level $x=0.7$, the empirically determined single-agent doses to achieve $x$ are $D_{A,0.7}=4\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$ and $D_{B,0.7}=10\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$. In a fixed-ratio combination experiment at the same target effect level, the combination doses measured are $c_A=2\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$ and $c_B=6\\,\\mu \\mathrm{M}$. Using the Chou–Talalay framework described, compute the Combination Index (CI) for this combination at $x=0.7$. Express your final answer as a pure number without units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the Chou–Talalay Combination Index ($CI$) for a two-drug combination therapy at a specified fractional effect level, $x$. The theoretical foundation for this index is the median-effect principle applied to dose-effect relationships. For a combination of two mutually exclusive drugs, designated here as drug $A$ and drug $B$, the $CI$ at an effect level $x$ is defined as the sum of the fractional doses. Each fractional dose is the ratio of the drug's concentration in the combination to the concentration of the single agent that would produce the same effect level $x$ on its own. The general formula is:\n$$CI_x = \\frac{(D)_A}{(D_x)_A} + \\frac{(D)_B}{(D_x)_B}$$\nIn this equation, $(D)_A$ and $(D)_B$ are the doses of drugs $A$ and $B$ used in the combination to achieve the effect $x$. The terms $(D_x)_A$ and $(D_x)_B$ represent the isoeffective doses of the single agents (i.e., the dose of drug $A$ alone or drug $B$ alone required to produce effect $x$).\n\nThe problem statement provides the following notation and values:\n- The target fractional effect level is $x = 0.7$.\n- The doses of the drugs in the combination that achieve this effect are $c_A = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $c_B = 6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n- The single-agent doses that individually achieve the same effect are $D_{A,0.7} = 4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and $D_{B,0.7} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nAdapting the general formula to the specific notation of the problem, we have:\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{c_A}{D_{A,0.7}} + \\frac{c_B}{D_{B,0.7}}$$\nThis equation quantifies the nature of the drug interaction. A value of $CI_{0.7} = 1$ indicates additivity, which is the baseline assumption in the Loewe additivity model. A value of $CI_{0.7} < 1$ indicates synergy, meaning the drugs are more effective together than expected. A value of $CI_{0.7} > 1$ indicates antagonism, meaning the drugs interfere with each other or are less effective in combination.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into the formula:\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{4\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} + \\frac{6\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}$$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) in the numerator and denominator of each term cancel out, which confirms that the $CI$ is a dimensionless quantity as required.\n$$CI_{0.7} = \\frac{2}{4} + \\frac{6}{10}$$\nPerforming the arithmetic for each fraction:\n$$CI_{0.7} = 0.5 + 0.6$$\nSumming the two terms gives the final value for the Combination Index:\n$$CI_{0.7} = 1.1$$\nThe calculated Combination Index for this drug combination at the $70\\%$ effect level ($x=0.7$) is $1.1$. Since this value is greater than $1$, the interaction between drug $A$ and drug $B$ at this specific dose ratio and effect level is classified as antagonistic.",

            "introduction": "The principle of quantifying dose-dependent interactions extends beyond cancer therapy into other critical areas like infectious disease. In microbiology, the same concept of Loewe additivity is used to assess antibiotic combinations, but it is often termed the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index ($FICI$).

            "problem": "A clinical microbiology laboratory performs a checkerboard assay to evaluate the interaction between two antibiotics against a single bacterial isolate. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) is defined as the lowest concentration at which no visible growth is observed under standardized conditions. The antibiotics are tested individually and in combination at equal-effect levels (complete growth inhibition at $24$ hours).\n\nAntibiotic $A$ has an individual Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of $8$ micrograms per milliliter, and antibiotic $B$ has an individual Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of $1$ microgram per milliliter. In the combination well that achieves the same no-growth effect, the measured concentrations are $2$ micrograms per milliliter of $A$ and $0.25$ micrograms per milliliter of $B$.\n\nStarting from the principle of Loewe additivity, wherein in an equal-effect combination each agent contributes a share relative to its standalone effective concentration along an isobole, construct the appropriate dimensionless index that aggregates the contributions of both drugs and compute its value for the observed combination.

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and calculation of a dimensionless index to quantify the interaction between two antibiotics, $A$ and $B$, based on the principle of Loewe additivity. This principle provides a framework for defining an additive interaction, against which synergy or antagonism can be measured. For an equal-effect combination, such as achieving the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Loewe additivity posits that the sum of the fractional contributions of each drug should equal unity.\n\nThe fractional contribution of each drug is the ratio of its concentration in the effective combination to the concentration that produces the same effect when the drug is used alone. This latter concentration is, by definition, the MIC of the individual drug. Let $MIC_A$ and $MIC_B$ be the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations of antibiotics $A$ and $B$ when used alone, respectively. Let $C_A$ and $C_B$ be the concentrations of antibiotics $A$ and $B$ in a combination that also results in the MIC effect (no visible growth).\n\nThe fractional inhibitory concentration ($FIC$) for each drug is defined as:\n$$FIC_A = \\frac{C_A}{MIC_A}$$\n$$FIC_B = \\frac{C_B}{MIC_B}$$\n\nThe dimensionless index that aggregates these contributions is the sum of the individual $FIC$ values, known as the Fractional Inhibitory Concentration Index ($FICI$ or $\\sum FIC$).\n$$FICI = FIC_A + FIC_B$$\n\nSubstituting the definitions for $FIC_A$ and $FIC_B$, the formula for the index is:\n$$FICI = \\frac{C_A}{MIC_A} + \\frac{C_B}{MIC_B}$$\n\nThis index provides a quantitative measure of the drug interaction:\n- If $FICI = 1$, the interaction is termed additive. The combined effect is exactly what would be predicted by the Loewe additivity model.\n- If $FICI < 1$, the interaction is synergistic. The drugs are more effective in combination than predicted, meaning a lower total fractional concentration is needed to achieve the effect. A common threshold for clinically significant synergy is $FICI \\leq 0.5$.\n- If $FICI > 1$, the interaction is antagonistic. The drugs are less effective in combination, requiring a higher total fractional concentration to achieve the effect.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- MIC of antibiotic $A$, $MIC_A = 8$ micrograms per milliliter.\n- MIC of antibiotic $B$, $MIC_B = 1$ microgram per milliliter.\n- Concentration of $A$ in the effective combination, $C_A = 2$ micrograms per milliliter.\n- Concentration of $B$ in the effective combination, $C_B = 0.25$ micrograms per milliliter.\n\nWe can now compute the individual $FIC$ values:\n$$FIC_A = \\frac{2 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}}{8 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}} = 0.25$$\n$$FIC_B = \\frac{0.25 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}}{1 \\, \\mu\\text{g/mL}} = 0.25$$\n\nThe $FICI$ is the sum of these values:\n$$FICI = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be reported to four significant figures. The exact calculated value is $0.5$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.5000$. This result indicates that the interaction between antibiotics $A$ and $B$ is synergistic.",
