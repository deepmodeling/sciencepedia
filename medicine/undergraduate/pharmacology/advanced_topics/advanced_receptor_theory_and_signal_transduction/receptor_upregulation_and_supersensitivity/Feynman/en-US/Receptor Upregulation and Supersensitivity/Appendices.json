            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n- **Experimental condition:** Cultured cells expressing a single class of receptors are treated with a selective antagonist for $7$ days.\n- **Assay method:** Equilibrium saturation radioligand binding using a high-specific-activity agonist radioligand.\n- **Assay temperature:** $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- **Experimental results (post-treatment vs. pre-treatment):**\n    - The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is unchanged, with $K_d \\approx 2\\ \\mathrm{nM}$.\n    - The maximum binding capacity, $B_{max}$, shows a two-fold increase from approximately $100\\ \\mathrm{fmol/mg}$ protein to approximately $200\\ \\mathrm{fmol/mg}$ protein.\n- **Control conditions:** No changes were detected in radioligand depletion, assay temperature, or membrane protein recovery.\n- **Governing equations:**\n    - Fractional occupancy: $f = \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$\n    - Specific bound radioligand: $B = B_{max}\\, f$\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic and well-established phenomenon in pharmacology: receptor upregulation in response to chronic antagonist exposure. The methods (saturation radioligand binding), parameters ($K_d$, $B_{max}$), and governing equations (law of mass action for a bimolecular interaction) are all fundamental to receptor theory and practice. The provided numerical values are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated, providing specific experimental outcomes ($K_d$ constant, $B_{max}$ doubled) and asking for conclusions that can be logically derived from this data using provided theoretical principles. A definite set of conclusions can be reached.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It gives the experimental data and the theoretical framework needed for interpretation. The data are internally consistent.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not violate any of the other criteria for validity. It is a standard, non-trivial problem in quantitative pharmacology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem lies in interpreting the parameters of the specific binding isotherm, which is derived by combining the two given equations:\n$$\nB = B_{max} \\cdot f = B_{max} \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}\n$$\nwhere $B$ is the specific bound radioligand concentration at a given free radioligand concentration $[L]$.\n\nThe two key parameters obtained from fitting this equation to experimental data are:\n1.  **$K_d$ (Equilibrium Dissociation Constant):** This is the concentration of ligand at which $50\\%$ of the receptors are occupied at equilibrium ($f=0.5$). It is an inverse measure of the affinity of the ligand for the receptor. A smaller $K_d$ implies higher affinity.\n2.  **$B_{max}$ (Maximum Binding Capacity):** This represents the theoretical maximum concentration of bound ligand when all available receptors are occupied. It is directly proportional to the total number of receptors in the preparation.\n\nThe experiment shows that after $7$ days of antagonist treatment, $K_d$ is unchanged while $B_{max}$ has doubled.\n- **Unchanged $K_d$**: This indicates that the affinity of the agonist radioligand for its binding site on the receptor has not changed. The structural and chemical properties of the receptor's binding pocket are stable.\n- **Doubled $B_{max}$**: This indicates that the total number of receptors available for binding has doubled. This phenomenon is known as **receptor upregulation**.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on these deductions.\n\n**A. The primary change is an increase in receptor number (upregulation), while ligand–receptor affinity is unchanged.**\n- **Analysis:** As derived above, the two-fold increase in $B_{max}$ directly corresponds to a two-fold increase in the total receptor number, which is the definition of upregulation. The unchanged $K_d$ indicates that the ligand-receptor affinity is constant. This statement is a direct and accurate interpretation of the experimental data.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The primary change is an increase in ligand affinity due to stabilization of a high-affinity state; therefore $K_d$ should decrease while $B_{max}$ remains constant.**\n- **Analysis:** An increase in ligand affinity would manifest as a *decrease* in the numerical value of $K_d$. The problem explicitly states that $K_d$ is unchanged. Furthermore, this option claims $B_{max}$ remains constant, which directly contradicts the experimental finding that $B_{max}$ doubled. This option describes a scenario inconsistent with the data.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. At radioligand concentrations $[L]$ where $[L] \\ll K_d$, specific binding after treatment will be approximately twice the pretreatment value.**\n- **Analysis:** The specific binding is given by $B = B_{max} \\dfrac{[L]}{[L] + K_d}$. In the low-concentration regime, where $[L] \\ll K_d$, the denominator can be approximated as $[L] + K_d \\approx K_d$. The binding equation simplifies to:\n$$\nB \\approx B_{max} \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d}\n$$\nThis indicates that at very low ligand concentrations, specific binding is approximately linear with $[L]$, with a slope of $B_{max}/K_d$.\nLet $B_{pre}$ and $B_{max,pre}$ be the values before treatment, and $B_{post}$ and $B_{max,post}$ be the values after treatment.\n- Pre-treatment: $B_{pre} \\approx B_{max,pre} \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d}$\n- Post-treatment: $B_{post} \\approx B_{max,post} \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d}$\nGiven that $B_{max,post} = 2 \\cdot B_{max,pre}$ and $K_d$ is constant, we can write:\n$$\nB_{post} \\approx (2 \\cdot B_{max,pre}) \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d} = 2 \\cdot \\left( B_{max,pre} \\dfrac{[L]}{K_d} \\right) \\approx 2 \\cdot B_{pre}\n$$\nThus, for any given low concentration $[L]$, the specific binding after treatment will be approximately twice the value before treatment.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. On a Scatchard analysis plotting $B/F$ versus $B$ (where $B$ is specifically bound radioligand and $F$ is free radioligand concentration), the slope will be unchanged and the $x$-intercept will increase two-fold after treatment.**\n- **Analysis:** The Scatchard equation is a linearization of the binding isotherm. We start with $B = B_{max} \\dfrac{F}{F + K_d}$, where we use $F$ for the free ligand concentration $[L]$.\n$$\nB(F + K_d) = B_{max} F\n$$\n$$\nBF + BK_d = B_{max} F\n$$\n$$\nBK_d = (B_{max} - B)F\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{B}{F} = \\frac{B_{max} - B}{K_d} = -\\frac{1}{K_d}B + \\frac{B_{max}}{K_d}\n$$\nThis equation is in the form of a line $y = mx+c$, where $y = B/F$ and $x = B$.\n- The **slope** is $m = -1/K_d$.\n- The **$x$-intercept** is found by setting $y=0$, which gives $B = B_{max}$.\nThe experimental data show that $K_d$ is unchanged and $B_{max}$ is doubled.\n- Since $K_d$ is unchanged, the slope $m = -1/K_d$ is also unchanged.\n- Since $B_{max}$ is doubled, the $x$-intercept, which is equal to $B_{max}$, also increases two-fold.\nThe statement in this option is a mathematically correct description of how the Scatchard plot would change based on the experimental data.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**E. In functional assays, the cells are expected to display agonist supersensitivity as a consequence of increased receptor density.**\n- **Analysis:** Receptor upregulation (increased receptor density, i.e., increased $B_{max}$) is a well-established cellular mechanism that leads to functional supersensitivity to agonists. With more receptors available, a given concentration of agonist can elicit a larger cellular response. This typically manifests as a leftward shift in the agonist concentration-response curve (lower $EC_{50}$) and/or an increase in the maximal response ($E_{max}$). The link between increased receptor number and the resulting functional supersensitivity is a fundamental principle of receptor theory. Therefore, based on the binding data showing a two-fold increase in receptor density, it is a sound theoretical conclusion to expect agonist supersensitivity.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**F. The binding data imply receptor downregulation and rightward shifts of agonist concentration–response curves due to desensitization.**\n- **Analysis:** \"Receptor downregulation\" means a decrease in receptor number ($B_{max}$). The data show a two-fold *increase* in $B_{max}$. Therefore, the data imply upregulation, not downregulation. \"Rightward shifts of agonist concentration-response curves\" indicates desensitization (decreased sensitivity). This is the functional opposite of the expected supersensitivity (as discussed in E). Chronic antagonist exposure leads to upregulation and supersensitivity, whereas chronic *agonist* exposure typically leads to downregulation and desensitization. This option describes the opposite of what was observed and what is theoretically expected.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A tissue expresses a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).\n- The receptor couples to a measurable downstream response.\n- Two agonists act on this receptor: a full agonist $F$ and a partial agonist $P$.\n- At baseline, the tissue exhibits receptor reserve (spare receptors) for $F$.\n- At baseline, the tissue does not exhibit receptor reserve for $P$.\n- Chronic exposure to a competitive antagonist causes receptor upregulation (increased receptor number), producing pharmacologic supersensitivity.\n- Chronic exposure to a potent full agonist causes receptor downregulation (decreased receptor number).\n- Assumption: The degree of downregulation is sufficient to abolish the baseline receptor reserve for $F$.\n- Question: Predict the qualitative changes in the dose-response relationships for $F$ and $P$ under each condition (upregulation and downregulation), specifically for the apparent potency (half-maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}$) and the maximal response (maximum effect, $E_{max}$).\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly rooted in fundamental principles of receptor pharmacology. Concepts such as G protein-coupled receptors, full versus partial agonists, receptor reserve, upregulation, downregulation, maximal effect ($E_{max}$), and potency ($EC_{50}$) are all standard, well-established concepts.

The provided information, including the crucial details about receptor reserve for each agonist and the extent of downregulation, is sufficient to deduce a unique qualitative solution based on established receptor theory.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of ambiguity or subjectivity. Terms are used in their standard pharmacological context.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions, missing information, or violations of physical principles. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information.\n\n## Derivation of Solution\n\nThis problem requires an understanding of receptor theory, specifically how agonist efficacy, receptor number, and receptor reserve collectively determine the characteristics of a dose-response curve ($EC_{50}$ and $E_{max}$).\n\nLet $[R_T]$ be the total number of receptors.\nLet $E_{system\\_max}$ be the maximum possible response the tissue's downstream signaling machinery can produce.\nLet $K_D$ be the dissociation constant, representing the intrinsic affinity of a ligand for the receptor. $K_D$ is the concentration of ligand that occupies $50\\%$ of receptors at equilibrium. It is an intrinsic property and does not change with $[R_T]$.\nLet $EC_{50}$ be the concentration of an agonist that produces $50\\%$ of its own maximal effect ($E_{max}$). This is the measure of apparent potency.\nLet $E_{max}$ be the maximal effect produced by a specific agonist in the system.\n\n**Baseline State Analysis**\n- **Full Agonist ($F$)**: $F$ has high intrinsic efficacy. The problem states there is a receptor reserve for $F$. This means that $F$ can elicit the system's absolute maximal response ($E_{max,F} = E_{system\\_max}$) while occupying only a fraction of the total receptors ($[R_T]$). Because a full response is achieved at non-saturating concentrations, the concentration needed to achieve a half-maximal response is significantly lower than the concentration needed to occupy half the receptors. Thus, for $F$ at baseline: $E_{max,F} = E_{system\\_max}$ and $EC_{50,F} < K_{D,F}$.\n- **Partial Agonist ($P$)**: $P$ has lower intrinsic efficacy than $F$. The problem states there is no receptor reserve for $P$. This implies that even when $P$ occupies all available receptors ($100\\%$ occupancy), the response it generates is less than the system's maximum ($E_{max,P} < E_{system\\_max}$). Since there is no reserve, the concentration needed to produce a half-maximal response is approximately equal to the concentration that occupies half the receptors. Thus, for $P$ at baseline: $E_{max,P} < E_{system\\_max}$ and $EC_{50,P} \\approx K_{D,P}$.\n\n**Analysis of Condition 1: Upregulation**\nChronic antagonist exposure leads to an increase in the total receptor number, $[R_T]$.\n- **Effect on Full Agonist ($F$)**:\n  - $E_{max}$: At baseline, $F$ already produced the system's maximal response, $E_{system\\_max}$. Adding more receptors does not increase the capacity of the downstream signaling pathway, so the maximal response cannot increase. Therefore, $E_{max,F}$ remains **unchanged**.\n  - $EC_{50}$: The receptor reserve, which was already present for $F$, is now even larger. To produce a given response (e.g., $50\\%$ of $E_{system\\_max}$), a smaller absolute number of receptors must be activated. With a larger total pool of receptors ($[R_T]$), this required number of activated receptors is achieved at a lower agonist concentration. This manifests as a **leftward shift** in the dose-response curve, meaning the apparent $EC_{50}$ for $F$ **decreases**.\n- **Effect on Partial Agonist ($P$)**:\n  - $E_{max}$: At baseline, the $E_{max}$ for $P$ was limited by its lower intrinsic efficacy and the number of receptors. By increasing $[R_T]$, the total signal generated when all receptors are occupied by $P$ will now be greater. Therefore, $E_{max,P}$ **increases**.\n  - $EC_{50}$: At baseline, $P$ had no reserve. The increase in $[R_T]$ creates a receptor reserve for $P$. Similar to the logic for $F$, the system is now more sensitive to $P$. A lower concentration of $P$ is now sufficient to elicit a half-maximal response (i.e., $50\\%$ of its new, higher $E_{max}$). This causes a **leftward shift** in the dose-response curve, meaning the apparent $EC_{50}$ for $P$ **decreases**.\n\n**Analysis of Condition 2: Downregulation**\nChronic full agonist exposure leads to a decrease in the total receptor number, $[R_T]$. The key constraint is that this decrease is sufficient to abolish the receptor reserve for $F$.\n- **Effect on Full Agonist ($F$)**:\n  - $EC_{50}$: The defining characteristic of a receptor reserve is that it causes the $EC_{50}$ to be less than the $K_D$. Abolishing this reserve means that the system is less sensitive, and a higher fraction of receptors must be occupied to produce a response. The dose-response curve must shift to the **right**, and the apparent $EC_{50}$ for $F$ **increases** (moving closer to its $K_D$).\n  - $E_{max}$: If the reserve is just barely abolished, $F$ might still be able to produce $E_{system\\_max}$ by occupying $100\\%$ of the remaining receptors. However, a loss of receptors sufficient to abolish the reserve often means that the total number of receptors has fallen below the threshold required to generate $E_{system\\_max}$. In this scenario, $F$ begins to behave like a partial agonist, and its maximal effect is reduced. Therefore, it is most likely that $E_{max,F}$ **decreases**.\n- **Effect on Partial Agonist ($P$)**:\n  - $E_{max}$: At baseline, $P$ already had no reserve and could not produce $E_{system\\_max}$. A further reduction in the number of available receptors will inevitably lead to a further reduction in the total possible signal generated by P. Therefore, $E_{max,P}$ **decreases**.\n  - $EC_{50}$: At baseline, $P$ had no reserve ($EC_{50,P} \\approx K_{D,P}$). After downregulation, there is still no reserve. To achieve $50\\%$ of a *new, lower* $E_{max}$, the concentration dependence still relates closely to the intrinsic affinity, $K_D$, which is unchanged. However, a more rigorous analysis using an operational model shows that a decrease in receptor density universally decreases the transducer function for both agonists, leading to a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for both. Therefore, the apparent $EC_{50}$ for $P$ is expected to **increase** (a **rightward shift**).\n\n**Summary of Predictions**\n- **Upregulation**: For $F$, $E_{max}$ is unchanged, $EC_{50}$ decreases (left shift). For $P$, $E_{max}$ increases, $EC_{50}$ decreases (left shift).\n- **Downregulation**: For $F$, $E_{max}$ decreases, $EC_{50}$ increases (right shift). For $P$, $E_{max}$ decreases, $EC_{50}$ increases (right shift).\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Upregulation causes a leftward shift (lower apparent $EC_{50}$) for both $F$ and $P$; $E_{max}$ is unchanged for $F$ and increased for $P$. Downregulation causes a rightward shift (higher apparent $EC_{50}$) for both $F$ and $P$; $E_{max}$ is decreased for both, with a larger decrease for $P$.**\n- **Upregulation**: This matches our derived predictions: $EC_{50}$ decreases for both $F$ and $P$. $E_{max}$ is unchanged for $F$ and increased for $P$.\n- **Downregulation**: This matches our derived predictions: $EC_{50}$ increases for both $F$ and $P$. $E_{max}$ is decreased for both. The note that the decrease is larger for $P$ is also physiologically correct, as $P$ has no reserve to lose and is more sensitive to receptor loss.\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Upregulation causes a rightward shift (higher apparent $EC_{50}$) for both $F$ and $P$ and decreases $E_{max}$ for both; downregulation causes a leftward shift (lower apparent $EC_{50}$) and increases $E_{max}$ for both.**\n- This option describes desensitization for upregulation and supersensitivity for downregulation, which is the exact opposite of the established pharmacological phenomena.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Upregulation increases $E_{max}$ and does not change apparent $EC_{50}$ for both $F$ and $P$; downregulation decreases $E_{max}$ but does not change apparent $EC_{50}$ for both.**\n- This option incorrectly claims that $EC_{50}$ does not change in either condition. Changes in receptor number and reserve directly impact apparent potency ($EC_{50}$). It also incorrectly claims upregulation increases $E_{max}$ for $F$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Downregulation reduces $E_{max}$ only for $P$ while leaving $F$ unchanged in both $E_{max}$ and apparent $EC_{50}$; upregulation increases $E_{max}$ only for $F$ with no shift in apparent $EC_{50}$ for either agonist.**\n- This option contains multiple errors. It wrongly claims downregulation leaves $F$ unchanged (abolishing the reserve mandates an increase in $EC_{50}$). It wrongly claims upregulation increases $E_{max}$ for $F$ but not $P$ (the opposite is true). It also wrongly claims no shift in $EC_{50}$ for upregulation.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

The maximal binding capacity ($B_{max}$) in a saturation binding assay reflects the total concentration of binding sites (receptor density) and is independent of ligand concentration.\n- In a simple receptor-effector model with a single binding site and non-cooperative binding (Hill coefficient $n_H \\approx 1$), increasing receptor number increases receptor reserve and typically shifts the concentration-response curve of an agonist leftward (decreased half-maximal effective concentration (EC50)) and can increase maximal effect ($E_{max}$) if the system was previously receptor-limited.

Denervation supersensitivity: Chronic reduction in neurotransmitter release leads to homeostatic upregulation of postsynaptic receptors.\n- **Available Resources:**\n    - Unilateral denervation in adult rats, with the contralateral side as control.\n    - Saturation binding with a high-affinity, selective antagonist radioligand.\n    - Cumulative concentration-response curves using an exogenous agonist in an organ bath.\n    - A neuronal uptake inhibitor.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established pharmacological principles, including receptor theory, ligand binding kinetics, and the mechanism of denervation supersensitivity. All concepts are standard in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for the design of an experiment and the prediction of its outcome to test a specific, well-defined hypothesis. A unique, best answer can be reasoned from the provided principles.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical and precise, referring to standard experimental procedures and quantitative parameters (`$K_d$`, `$B_{max}$`, `$EC_{50}$`, `$n_H$`). It is free of subjectivity.\n- **Complete and Consistent:** The problem provides sufficient background theory and lists the available experimental resources to formulate a sound plan. The principles given are internally consistent and consistent with established science.\n- **Realistic and Feasible:** The proposed experiment (unilateral denervation, radioligand binding, organ bath studies) uses classic and feasible techniques in pharmacology. The timeframes and concentrations are realistic.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n- **Action:** Proceed with a full solution and option analysis.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe scientific goal is to demonstrate that chronic sympathetic denervation causes an increase in postsynaptic receptors (upregulation), which in turn leads to a functional increase in sensitivity to an agonist (supersensitivity). The experimental design must cleanly separate this postsynaptic mechanism from other potential causes of supersensitivity, such as reduced neurotransmitter clearance.\n\n1.  **Measuring Receptor Upregulation:** The hypothesis of \"postsynaptic receptor upregulation\" means there is an increase in the number of receptors. According to the provided principles, the total concentration of receptors is measured by the maximal binding capacity, `$B_{max}$`, in a saturation radioligand binding assay. Therefore, a valid experiment must be able to accurately measure `$B_{max}$`.\n    -   To determine `$B_{max}$` and `$K_d$` accurately, one must perform a saturation experiment using multiple concentrations of a radioligand to generate a binding curve. Analysis by non-linear regression then yields these parameters. An experiment using only a single ligand concentration is insufficient.\n    -   An antagonist radioligand is preferable to an agonist radioligand for determining total receptor number, as antagonists typically bind to all receptor states without inducing downstream effects like internalization or desensitization that could artificially lower the measured `$B_{max}$`.\n    -   The prediction, based on the hypothesis and background principles, is that denervated tissue will have an **increased `$B_{max}$`**. Furthermore, the principles state that receptor density changes do not alter the ligand-receptor affinity, so there should be **no significant change in `$K_d$`**.\n\n2.  **Measuring Functional Supersensitivity:** The functional correlate of receptor upregulation is supersensitivity, an enhanced response to an agonist. This is measured by constructing a concentration-response curve.\n    -   Supersensitivity manifests as a leftward shift of this curve, meaning a lower concentration of agonist is needed to produce a given effect. The key parameter is the `$EC_{50}$` (half-maximal effective concentration), which should **decrease**.\n    -   The maximal effect, `$E_{max}$`, may increase if the system was previously receptor-limited, but this is not a guaranteed outcome.\n    -   The slope of the curve, represented by the Hill coefficient `$n_H$`, reflects the cooperativity of the response. Since the proposed mechanism is an increase in the number of otherwise unchanged receptors, and the background states `$n_H \\approx 1$`, we expect the slope to be **unchanged**.\n\n3.  **Controlling for Confounding Variables:** A critical aspect of denervation is the loss of neuronal uptake machinery (e.g., the norepinephrine transporter, NET). If an agonist that is a substrate for this transporter (like norepinephrine itself) is used, its local concentration will be higher in the denervated tissue (where there is no uptake) than in the control tissue. This would cause a leftward shift in the concentration-response curve that is due to a change in drug disposition, not a change in postsynaptic receptors. To isolate the postsynaptic effect, this confounding variable must be eliminated. This is achieved by using a neuronal uptake inhibitor (e.g., cocaine) in **both** the control and denervated tissue preparations. This equalizes the effect of uptake blockade across groups. Alternatively, one could use an agonist that is not a substrate for the uptake transporter (e.g., phenylephrine for $\\alpha_1$-adrenoceptors).\n\n4.  **Time Course:** Receptor upregulation is a cellular adaptation involving changes in gene expression and protein synthesis. This is a slow process. Therefore, the experiment must be conducted after a chronic period of denervation, typically `$1$ to $2$` weeks (`$7$–$14$` days). Acute experiments (e.g., `$24$` hours) are inappropriate for studying this specific mechanism.\n\n**Summary of the Ideal Experiment and Predicted Outcome:**\n-   **Method:** Perform unilateral denervation and allow `$7$–$14$` days for adaptation. Use the contralateral artery as a control.\n-   **Binding:** Conduct saturation binding with a selective antagonist radioligand over a range of concentrations.\n-   **Binding Prediction:** Increased `$B_{max}$` in the denervated artery with no change in `$K_d$`.\n-   **Function:** Construct agonist concentration-response curves in the presence of a neuronal uptake inhibitor.\n-   **Function Prediction:** A leftward shift of the curve (decreased `$EC_{50}$`), with no significant change in the Hill slope (`$n_H$`), and a possible increase in `$E_{max}$`.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Perform unilateral sympathetic denervation of the rat tail artery and wait $7$–$14$ days. Prepare membrane homogenates from denervated and contralateral control arteries. Conduct saturation binding with a selective antagonist radioligand over $10$–$12$ concentrations spanning $10^{-11}$ to $10^{-7}$ molar to estimate $B_{max}$ and $K_d$ by nonlinear regression. In parallel, in organ baths with uptake blocked (e.g., cocaine $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$), construct cumulative concentration-response curves to phenylephrine ($10^{-10}$ to $10^{-5}$ molar). Expect the denervated side to show a higher $B_{max}$ with no significant change in $K_d$, and a leftward-shifted functional curve with similar Hill slope ($n_H \\approx 1$) and a possible increase in $E_{max}$ if the control was receptor-limited.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option describes an exemplary experimental plan. The time course (`$7$–$14$` days) is appropriate for receptor upregulation. The binding assay is correctly designed (saturation curve with an antagonist, multiple concentrations, proper analysis). The functional assay correctly controls for the confounding effect of neurotransmitter uptake by including an inhibitor. The predictions (increased `$B_{max}$`, unchanged `$K_d$`, leftward shift/decreased `$EC_{50}$`, unchanged `$n_H$`, possible increase in `$E_{max}$`) are all fully consistent with the provided first principles for denervation supersensitivity mediated by receptor upregulation.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. Perform acute chemical sympathectomy with a single dose of a vesicular monoamine transporter blocker and test $24$ hours later. Use competition binding at a single radioligand concentration to estimate $K_d$. In organ baths without uptake blockade, construct concentration-response curves to norepinephrine. Expect the denervated side to show a lower $B_{max}$, lower $K_d$ (higher affinity), and a steeper dose-response slope ($n_H > 1.5$) because of increased receptor reserve.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is flawed in nearly every aspect. `$24$` hours is too short for postsynaptic upregulation. A single-point binding assay cannot determine `$B_{max}$` or `$K_d$`. Using norepinephrine without uptake blockade introduces a major confounder. The predictions are incorrect: upregulation would increase, not decrease, `$B_{max}$`; it would not change `$K_d$`; and there is no basis to expect the Hill slope `$n_H$` to increase to more than `$1.5$`.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. Perform unilateral denervation and test after $7$ days. Conduct saturation binding with an agonist radioligand at a single concentration near its $K_d$ to estimate receptor density. In organ baths, construct concentration-response curves to phenylephrine with no uptake inhibitor. Expect unchanged $B_{max}$, decreased $K_d$, and a rightward shift in the denervated tissue due to loss of neuronal input.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option is also highly flawed. Using an agonist radioligand for `$B_{max}$` determination is problematic. A single concentration point is insufficient. The functional assay is confounded because while phenylephrine is a poor substrate for neuronal uptake compared to norepinephrine, not blocking uptake is still methodologically less rigorous. The predictions are entirely wrong: `$B_{max}$` should increase (not be unchanged), `$K_d$` should be unchanged (not decreased), and the curve should shift left (supersensitivity), not right (desensitization).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Perform unilateral denervation and test after $7$ days. Use saturation binding with a selective antagonist radioligand over $8$ concentrations to estimate $B_{max}$ and $K_d$. In organ baths with uptake intact, construct concentration-response curves to norepinephrine. Expect an increased $B_{max}$ with increased $K_d$ (lower affinity), and no shift in EC50 but a markedly steeper slope ($n_H$ increases) due to receptor upregulation.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option starts with a reasonable binding assay design but fails on the functional side by using norepinephrine with uptake intact, introducing a known confounder. The predictions are inconsistent with the principles. While it correctly predicts an increased `$B_{max}$`, it incorrectly predicts an increased `$K_d$` (change in affinity), no shift in `$EC_{50}$` (which ignores both the postsynaptic and presynaptic causes of a leftward shift), and a steeper slope (`$n_H$`).\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",
