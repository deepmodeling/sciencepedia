The ligand is applied extracellularly at a constant bathing concentration $[L]=5\\,\\text{nM}$, and the bathing volume is large enough that ligand depletion by binding is negligible. You may assume equilibrium is achieved.\n\nThe downstream signaling output $E$ arises from an activation step that depends on the absolute number of occupied receptors $N_{\\text{bound}}$ via a saturable hyperbolic relationship with a half-maximal value when a fixed number $N_{50}$ of receptors are occupied. This captures the presence of receptor reserve in the system. For this cell, the half-maximal value occurs at $N_{50}=1.0\\times 10^{4}$ occupied receptors.\n\nStarting only from the definition of the dissociation constant and mass-action binding, derive the equilibrium fraction of receptors occupied $f$ at $[L]=5\\,\\text{nM}$, then use the stated saturable mapping from $N_{\\text{bound}}$ to $E$ to obtain the normalized signaling output $E/E_{\\max}$ at this ligand concentration. Report your final results as the ordered pair $(f,\\;E/E_{\\max})$. Express the final ordered pair as exact fractions with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of two quantities: the fraction of occupied receptors, $f$, and the normalized signaling output, $E/E_{\\max}$, under specified equilibrium conditions. The solution will be derived in two parts, starting from fundamental principles as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the fractional receptor occupancy, $f$.\n\nThe binding of a ligand, $L$, to a receptor, $R$, to form a complex, $RL$, is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$$\nAt equilibrium, the relationship between the concentrations of the reactants and the product is defined by the dissociation constant, $K_D$. By the law of mass action, $K_D$ is given by:\n$$K_D = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is the sum of the concentrations of free and bound receptors:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the ratio of the concentration of bound receptors to the total concentration of receptors:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nTo express $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_D$, we first rearrange the equation for $[R_T]$ to express $[R]$ in terms of $[RL]$ and $[R_T]$:\n$$[R] = [R_T] - [RL]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_D$:\n$$K_D = \\frac{([R_T] - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $[RL]/[R_T]$:\n$$K_D [RL] = ([R_T] - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_D [RL] = [R_T][L] - [RL][L]$$\n$$K_D [RL] + [RL][L] = [R_T][L]$$\n$$[RL](K_D + [L]) = [R_T][L]$$\nDividing both sides by $[R_T](K_D + [L])$ gives the expression for fractional occupancy, $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_D + [L]}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation for a $1{:}1$ binding interaction.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nLigand concentration, $[L] = 5\\,\\text{nM}$.\nDissociation constant, $K_D = 10\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{5\\,\\text{nM}}{10\\,\\text{nM} + 5\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{5\\,\\text{nM}}{15\\,\\text{nM}}$$\nThe units cancel, and we obtain the fractional occupancy as an exact fraction:\n$$f = \\frac{5}{15} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the normalized signaling output, $E/E_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem states that the signaling output, $E$, is related to the absolute number of occupied receptors, $N_{\\text{bound}}$, by a saturable hyperbolic relationship. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$E = E_{\\max} \\frac{N_{\\text{bound}}}{N_{50} + N_{\\text{bound}}}$$\nwhere $E_{\\max}$ is the maximum possible signaling output and $N_{50}$ is the number of occupied receptors required to achieve half-maximal output ($E = E_{\\max}/2$). The normalized signaling output is therefore:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{bound}}}{N_{50} + N_{\\text{bound}}}$$\nThe absolute number of occupied receptors, $N_{\\text{bound}}$, is the product of the fractional occupancy, $f$, and the total number of receptors per cell, which is given as $R_T$.\nThe given values are:\nTotal number of receptors per cell, $R_T = 1.0 \\times 10^5$.\nHalf-maximal activation number, $N_{50} = 1.0 \\times 10^4$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $N_{\\text{bound}}$ using the value of $f=1/3$ derived in Part 1:\n$$N_{\\text{bound}} = f \\times R_T = \\frac{1}{3} \\times (1.0 \\times 10^5) = \\frac{10^5}{3}$$\nNow, we substitute the values for $N_{\\text{bound}}$ and $N_{50}$ into the equation for the normalized signaling output:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{10^5}{3}}{1.0 \\times 10^4 + \\frac{10^5}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{10^5}{3}}{10^4 + \\frac{10^5}{3}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can write $10^5$ as $10 \\times 10^4$:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{10 \\times 10^4}{3}}{10^4 + \\frac{10 \\times 10^4}{3}}$$\nFactor out $10^4$ from the denominator:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3} \\times 10^4}{10^4 \\left(1 + \\frac{10}{3}\\right)}$$\nCancel the common factor of $10^4$:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3}}{1 + \\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3}}{\\frac{3}{3} + \\frac{10}{3}} = \\frac{\\frac{10}{3}}{\\frac{13}{3}}$$\nFinally, this simplifies to the exact fraction:\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{10}{13}$$\n\nThe requested result is the ordered pair $(f, E/E_{\\max})$.\nThe calculated values are $f = 1/3$ and $E/E_{\\max} = 10/13$.\nTherefore, the ordered pair is $(1/3, 10/13)$.",

You will explore the crucial distinction between a drug's affinity for its receptor ($K_D$) and its apparent potency in a biological system ($EC_{50}$). By deriving the relationship from first principles, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how the presence of \"spare receptors\" can dramatically increase a drug's potency, a key concept in drug action and design.

Using only the law of mass action for receptor occupancy and a rectangular hyperbola stimulus-to-response relationship, explain from first principles why the presence of spare receptors increases apparent potency (that is, decreases the agonist concentration needed to achieve a given fraction of maximal effect). Then, derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy $f$ required to produce $E/E_{\\max}=0.5$ in terms of the transduction coefficient $\\tau$, and evaluate it for $\\tau=10$. Give your final numerical result for $f$ as a decimal fraction with no units and do not use the percent sign. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to connect agonist concentration to receptor binding (occupancy) and then connect receptor occupancy to tissue response (effect). This involves two primary relationships.\n\nFirst, we model the binding of the agonist, denoted by $A$, to the receptor, denoted by $R$, to form an agonist-receptor complex, $AR$. According to the problem, this is a simple reversible process governed by the law of mass action:\n$$ A + R \\underset{k_{\\text{off}}}{\\overset{k_{\\text{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} AR $$\nAt equilibrium, the rates of association and dissociation are equal. The equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined as the ratio of the off-rate constant to the on-rate constant, $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$, and is also given by the concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]} $$\nHere, $[A]$, $[R]$, and $[AR]$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the free agonist, free receptor, and agonist-receptor complex, respectively.\n\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $f$, is the fraction of total receptors, $[R_T]$, that are occupied by the agonist. The total receptor concentration is the sum of free and occupied receptors: $[R_T] = [R] + [AR]$.\n$$ f = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{[AR]}{[R] + [AR]} $$\nBy rearranging the expression for $K_D$ to find $[R] = \\frac{K_D[AR]}{[A]}$ and substituting this into the equation for $f$, we obtain the Hill-Langmuir equation for fractional occupancy:\n$$ f = \\frac{[AR]}{\\frac{K_D[AR]}{[A]} + [AR]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[A]} + 1} = \\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_D} $$\nThis equation shows that fractional occupancy is a rectangular hyperbolic function of the agonist concentration $[A]$. The constant $K_D$ represents the agonist concentration at which half of the receptors are occupied ($f=0.5$). Thus, $K_D$ is a measure of the agonist's affinity for the receptor.\n\nSecond, we model the relationship between the stimulus generated by the occupied receptors and the final physiological response, $E$. The problem states this is a \"smooth, saturable stimulus-to-response\" relationship described by a rectangular hyperbola. This is formalized by the operational model of agonism (developed by Black and Leff), where the observed effect $E$ as a fraction of the maximal possible system effect $E_{\\max}$ is related to the fractional receptor occupancy $f$. The stimulus is considered proportional to the number of occupied receptors, and the efficiency of this coupling is captured by a transduction coefficient, $\\tau$. The relationship is:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\tau f}{1 + \\tau f} $$\nThe parameter $\\tau$ is a composite term that incorporates the total receptor density $[R_T]$ and the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist. A large value of $\\tau$ signifies an efficient coupling between receptor occupancy and response, which is characteristic of a system with a large receptor reserve.\n\nNow we can address the first part of the question: explaining why spare receptors increase apparent potency. Apparent potency is quantified by the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$, which is the agonist concentration required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximal effect *for that specific agonist*.\n\nTo find the relationship between agonist concentration $[A]$ and effect $E$, we substitute the expression for $f$ into the stimulus-response equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\tau \\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_D}\\right)}{1 + \\tau \\left(\\frac{[A]}{[A] + K_D}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\tau[A]}{[A]+K_D}}{\\frac{([A]+K_D) + \\tau[A]}{[A]+K_D}} = \\frac{\\tau[A]}{(1+\\tau)[A] + K_D} $$\nThis is the dose-response curve. The maximal effect achievable by this agonist, let's call it $E'_{max}$, is found by taking the limit as $[A] \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\frac{E'_{max}}{E_{\\max}} = \\lim_{[A] \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\tau[A]}{(1+\\tau)[A] + K_D} = \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau} $$\nA \"full agonist,\" as stated in the problem, is one that can elicit the system's maximal response, meaning $E'_{max} \\approx E_{\\max}$. This occurs when $\\tau \\gg 1$, such that $\\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau} \\approx 1$.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ is the value of $[A]$ that yields half of this maximal agonist effect, i.e., $E = \\frac{1}{2} E'_{max}$. This corresponds to a fractional effect of $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau}$. We set our dose-response equation to this value to solve for $[A] = \\mathrm{EC}_{50}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50}}{(1+\\tau) \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50} + K_D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\tau}{1+\\tau} $$\nSince $\\tau > 0$ for any active agonist, we can divide both sides by $\\tau$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{EC}_{50}}{(1+\\tau) \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50} + K_D} = \\frac{1}{2(1+\\tau)} $$\n$$ 2(1+\\tau) \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50} = (1+\\tau) \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50} + K_D $$\n$$ (1+\\tau) \\cdot \\mathrm{EC}_{50} = K_D $$\n$$ \\mathrm{EC}_{50} = \\frac{K_D}{1+\\tau} $$\nThis equation is key. Apparent potency is inversely related to $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. A higher potency corresponds to a lower $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$. The presence of \"spare receptors\" or \"receptor reserve\" means that the system has a high density of receptors, $[R_T]$, available for signaling. This high density leads to a large value for the transduction coefficient $\\tau$. As $\\tau$ increases, the denominator $(1+\\tau)$ increases, causing the $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ to decrease. Therefore, a system with a large receptor reserve (large $\\tau$) will exhibit a lower $\\mathrm{EC}_{50}$ value relative to its $K_D$, meaning it has a higher apparent potency. The agonist appears more potent because only a very low concentration is needed to occupy the small fraction of receptors sufficient to generate a significant response.\n\nNow, we address the second part of the question: to derive an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy $f$ that produces $E/E_{\\max}=0.5$. This is the occupancy required to achieve half of the *system's* maximal response. We use the stimulus-response equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\tau f}{1 + \\tau f} $$\nWe set $\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = 0.5$ (which is $\\frac{1}{2}$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{\\tau f}{1 + \\tau f} $$\nSolving for $f$:\n$$ 1 + \\tau f = 2 \\tau f $$\n$$ 1 = 2 \\tau f - \\tau f $$\n$$ 1 = \\tau f $$\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{\\tau} $$\nThis is the general expression for the fractional occupancy required to produce a half-maximal system response.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression for the given value $\\tau=10$:\n$$ f = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\nThus, in a system with a transduction coefficient of $10$, occupying just $10\\%$ of the total receptors is sufficient to achieve $50\\%$ of the maximal possible tissue response. This is a quantitative illustration of the concept of receptor reserve.",
