            "introduction": "The simplest way to quantify allosteric interactions is through the Allosteric Ternary Complex Model (ATCM), which describes the equilibrium between a receptor and its orthosteric and allosteric ligands. This model introduces a 'cooperativity factor,' $\\alpha$, that quantifies precisely how much the binding of the modulator changes the receptor's affinity for the primary agonist. This first practice provides a foundational exercise in deriving the mathematical relationship for this effect from first principles, allowing you to calculate the change in an agonist's apparent affinity in the presence of a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) .",

The equilibrium dissociation constants for the orthosteric agonist and the allosteric modulator are $K_{A}$ and $K_{B}$, respectively. The cooperativity factor $\\alpha$ quantifies how the binding of one ligand alters the affinity of the receptor for the other ligand; specifically, when $B$ is bound, the effective dissociation constant for $A$ becomes $K_{A}/\\alpha$, and when $A$ is bound, the effective dissociation constant for $B$ becomes $K_{B}/\\alpha$. Assume the modulator is a pure affinity modulator that does not change efficacy; thus, at high $[A]$ the receptor can be fully occupied by $A$ whether or not $B$ is present.\n\nStarting only from the definitions above and the law of mass action, derive the apparent dissociation constant of the orthosteric agonist $A$, denoted $K_{A,\\mathrm{app}}$, when the modulator $B$ is present at a fixed concentration $[B]$.
