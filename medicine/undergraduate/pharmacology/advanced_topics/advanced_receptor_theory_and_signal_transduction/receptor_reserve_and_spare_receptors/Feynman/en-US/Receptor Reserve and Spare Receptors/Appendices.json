This first exercise serves as a foundational practice, guiding you through the process of calculating an agonist's observable potency ($EC_{50}$) from its binding affinity ($K_A$) and the system's signal amplification capacity ($\\tau$). By also determining the receptor occupancy required for a half-maximal effect, this problem vividly illustrates how a large receptor reserve allows a full response to be generated when only a small fraction of receptors are occupied .",
