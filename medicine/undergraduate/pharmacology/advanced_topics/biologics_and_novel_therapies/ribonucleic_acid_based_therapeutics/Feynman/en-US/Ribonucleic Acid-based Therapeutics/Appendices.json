Suppose an mRNA formulation stored at $4\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ exhibits first-order degradation of intact strands under these conditions. Let $C(t)$ denote the amount of intact mRNA at time $t$ and $C_0$ the initial amount at $t=0$. The experimentally measured first-order degradation rate constant is $k = 0.002\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the fraction of intact messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) remaining after a specified time, based on the principle of first-order degradation kinetics.\n\nThe problem states that the process is first-order, which is defined by the rate of change in the amount of intact mRNA, $C(t)$, being directly proportional to the amount present at that time, $C(t)$. As this is a degradation process, the amount of intact mRNA decreases over time, so the rate of change is negative. This principle can be formalized as a differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = -k C(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order degradation rate constant. The givens are the rate constant $k = 0.002\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$ and the initial amount of intact mRNA at time $t=0$, which is denoted as $C_0$.\n\nTo find the expression for $C(t)$, we must solve this first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can achieve this by the method of separation of variables. Rearranging the equation to group terms involving $C$ on one side and terms involving $t$ on the other side yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C(t)} dC(t) = -k dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides of the equation. We integrate the left side from the initial amount $C_0$ at time $t=0$ to the amount $C(t)$ at a general time $t$. The right side is integrated from time $0$ to $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{C_0}^{C(t)} \\frac{1}{C'} dC' = \\int_{0}^{t} -k dt'\n$$\nHere, $C'$ and $t'$ are used as dummy variables for integration.\n\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$\n[\\ln|C'|]_{C_0}^{C(t)} = [-kt']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince the amount of a substance, $C(t)$, must be non-negative, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$\n\\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C_0) = (-kt) - (-k \\cdot 0)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, the left side simplifies to:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of intact mRNA remaining, which is precisely the ratio $\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}$. To solve for this fraction, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C_0}\\right)\\right) = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the fraction of intact mRNA remaining at any time $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{C(t)}{C_0} = \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThis completes the derivation from first principles.\n\nNow, we must compute the numerical value of this fraction at $t=30$ days. We are given the values:\n- Rate constant, $k = 0.002\\ \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- Time, $t = 30\\ \\text{days}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$\n\\frac{C(30)}{C_0} = \\exp(-0.002 \\times 30)\n$$\nFirst, calculate the exponent:\n$$\n-0.002 \\times 30 = -0.06\n$$\nSo, the fraction remaining is:\n$$\n\\frac{C(30)}{C_0} = \\exp(-0.06)\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(-0.06) \\approx 0.9417645331...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $4$, $1$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$\n0.94176... \\approx 0.9418\n$$\nThus, the fraction of intact mRNA remaining after $30$ days is approximately $0.9418$.",

Assume the following foundational bases grounded in the Central Dogma of molecular biology and standard turnover kinetics:\n- Translation produces the protein at a zero-order rate, denoted by $k_{in}(t)$, because under saturating ribosomal capacity within the tested range the production rate is effectively independent of the current protein concentration.\n- Protein loss occurs via first-order degradation with rate constant $k_{out}$, so that the degradation flux is $k_{out} P(t)$.\n\nBefore therapy ($t  0$), the system is at steady state with a constant production rate $k_{in,0}$ and a constant degradation rate constant $k_{out}$.
