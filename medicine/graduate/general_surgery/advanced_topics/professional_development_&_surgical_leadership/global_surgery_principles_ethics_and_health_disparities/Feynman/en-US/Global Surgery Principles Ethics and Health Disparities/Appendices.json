Surgical, Anesthesia, and Obstetric (SAO) providers include all clinically active surgeons, anesthetists, and obstetricians.

The DALY is the sum of Years of Life Lost (YLL) and Years Lived with Disability (YLD).\n\nFirst, the annual number of incident cases ($I_{\\text{total}}$) in the population is $20$, given the rate is $20$ per $100,000$ persons.\n\n**1.

The remaining life expectancy ($L$) is $35$ years. Thus, $\\text{YLL}_{\\text{no-surg}} = N_{\\text{deaths}} \\times L = 1 \\times 35 = 35$ years.\n- **YLD Calculation:** The number of survivors is $I_{\\text{survivors}} = I_{\\text{total}} - N_{\\text{deaths}} = 20 - 1 = 19$. These survivors experience a disability with a weight ($\\text{DW}$) of $0.1$ for a duration ($D$) of $1$ year.

DALYs in the Full-Coverage Surgery Scenario ($\\text{DALY}_{\\text{surg}}$)**\n- **YLL Calculation:** The number of deaths with surgery is $N_{\\text{deaths}} = I_{\\text{total}} \\times \\text{Case Fatality} = 20 \\times 0.005 = 0.1$. Thus, $\\text{YLL}_{\\text{surg}} = N_{\\text{deaths}} \\times L = 0.1 \\times 35 = 3.5$ years.\n- **YLD Calculation:** The problem states there is negligible disability after surgery, so $\\text{YLD}_{\\text{surg}} = 0$ years.\n- **Total DALYs:** $\\text{DALY}_{\\text{surg}} = \\text{YLL}_{\\text{surg}} + \\text{YLD}_{\\text{surg}} = 3.5 + 0 = 3.5$ years.\n\n**3.

For a beneficial health service such as CS (which averts maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality when medically indicated), $C  0$ implies the service is disproportionately concentrated among those with higher socioeconomic rank (pro-rich). Here, $C = 0.200$ is positive, indicating a pro-rich distribution: a larger share of total CS accrues to richer quintiles relative to their population share. From a global surgery ethics perspective, this suggests inequitable access favoring wealthier groups, raising concerns about unmet need among poorer quintiles and potential overuse among richer quintiles; equity-oriented policy would aim to reduce such disparity while ensuring medically appropriate indications across all quintiles.",
