By understanding the relationship between patient arrival rate, length of stay, and the number of occupied beds, surgical leaders can make data-driven estimates for resource planning. This practice  will help you apply this powerful principle to calculate the steady-state bed requirement for an inpatient ward and appreciate the crucial impact of system variability.",

            "problem": "A tertiary general surgery service operates a dedicated inpatient ward. Leadership needs to estimate the steady-state bed capacity required to avoid chronic over-occupancy. Assume a stable system in the sense that, over long horizons, the average admission rate equals the average discharge rate and patient inflow does not systematically exceed outflow. Let the long-run average admission rate be $\\lambda$ patients per unit time and let the Average Length of Stay (ALOS) be $W$ time units. The long-run average number of occupied beds is denoted by $L$. \n\nStarting from conservation-of-flow and time-averaging principles, derive the invariant relationship between $L$, $\\lambda$, and $W$ that holds in steady state. Then, using the following empirically observed figures for this surgery ward: daily average surgical admissions $\\lambda = 15$ patients per day and ALOS $W = 4$ days, compute the required steady-state bed capacity indicated by this relationship. \n\nFinally, provide a concise, principled explanation of how variability in day-to-day admissions and in individual lengths of stay can cause transient demand to exceed this mean requirement, even when the long-run averages are stable, and how this informs leadership decisions about capacity buffers.\n\nExpress the capacity as a count of beds, and round your numerical answer to two significant figures.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base consists of conservation-of-flow and time-averaging over a long horizon for a stable system of patients moving through a ward. Consider any horizon of length $T0$. Let $A(T)$ be the number of admissions during $T$, let $L(t)$ denote the instantaneous number of occupied beds at time $t$, and let $D(T)$ be the total patient-time accumulated over the horizon, measured in bed-days if time is measured in days. By definition,\n$$\nD(T) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{T} L(t)\\, dt.\n$$\nDefine the long-run time-average occupancy as\n$$\n\\bar{L} \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{D(T)}{T} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} L(t)\\, dt,\n$$\nassuming the limit exists under the stability condition. The Average Length of Stay (ALOS) $W$ is defined as the long-run average total time spent in the system per admission. Over a long horizon, this can be expressed as\n$$\nW \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{D(T)}{A(T)}.\n$$\nFor a stable system (long-run flow conservation), the long-run admission rate is\n$$\n\\lambda \\equiv \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{A(T)}{T}.\n$$\nCombining these definitions yields the invariant relationship between the time-average occupancy, the arrival rate, and the average length of stay:\n$$\n\\bar{L} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{D(T)}{T} = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{A(T)}{T}\\cdot \\frac{D(T)}{A(T)} = \\lambda W.\n$$\nThis identity is the content of Little’s Law, derived from conservation-of-flow and long-run averaging.\n\nInterpreting $\\bar{L}$ as the mean bed occupancy, the steady-state capacity implied by the long-run mean is therefore $L = \\lambda W$. Plugging in the ward’s figures,\n$$\n\\lambda = 15 \\text{ patients/day}, \\quad W = 4 \\text{ days},\n$$\ngives\n$$\nL = \\lambda W = 15 \\times 4 = 60.\n$$\nRounded to two significant figures, the required steady-state capacity is $60$ beds.\n\nImpact of variability: Even when $L=\\lambda W$ holds, day-to-day stochastic variation in admissions and individual patient lengths of stay can cause transient occupancy to exceed the mean. Two sources of variability are relevant: interarrival variability (for example, clustering of scheduled cases or bursts of emergency admissions) and service-time variability (heterogeneous lengths of stay). In the canonical infinite-server model (many parallel beds without queueing constraints), a well-tested fact is that the steady-state occupancy distribution is Poisson with mean $\\lambda W$, implying variance equal to the mean. Under this approximation, the standard deviation of occupancy is $\\sqrt{\\lambda W}$. Thus, if the mean occupancy is $L$, typical fluctuations are of order $\\sqrt{L}$. Leadership thus recognizes that designing capacity exactly at $L$ risks frequent full occupancy events; a buffer above $L$ mitigates the probability of bed shortages. For example, using a normal approximation to the Poisson distribution, the $p$-quantile of occupancy is approximately $L + z_{p}\\sqrt{L}$, where $z_{p}$ is the standard normal quantile corresponding to probability $p$. This principled buffer accounts for variability and sets a service level target (for example, choosing $p=0.95$ to reduce the likelihood of turning away or delaying admissions). Nonetheless, the minimal steady-state requirement is anchored by $L=\\lambda W$, and the buffer is a leadership decision calibrated to risk tolerance, surge capacity plans, and patient safety considerations.",

            "introduction": "Moving from system-level capacity to the efficiency of a critical resource, this practice focuses on operating room (OR) throughput. Efficiently managing the OR schedule is paramount for service-line productivity and financial health. This exercise  demonstrates how to calculate the maximum number of cases that can be completed in a day and reveals a critical, often counterintuitive, aspect of process improvement: due to the discrete nature of surgical cases, not all efficiency gains immediately translate into higher output.",
            "id": "4672071",
            "problem": "A general surgery service is planning daily elective throughput in a single Operating Room (OR). Each surgical case has an average in-room duration of $90$ minutes from wheels-in to wheels-out, and room turnover between completed cases requires an average of $20$ minutes. The scheduled day length is $8$ hours, and the scheduler will not overbook beyond the scheduled time. Assume that the day consists of an integer number of cases, that there is no turnover after the final case, and that averages are used deterministically for planning. Using only conservation of time and additivity of durations, determine the largest integer number of cases that can be completed within the scheduled day under the baseline turnover and under a reduced turnover of $10$ minutes. Then, based on these two values, compute the increase in the expected number of completed cases per day attributable to reducing turnover from $20$ minutes to $10$ minutes.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single number equal to the additional expected number of completed cases per day when turnover is reduced to $10$ minutes. No rounding is required and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed problem grounded in basic mathematical principles of time conservation and optimization under integer constraints. All necessary data are provided and are internally consistent. I will now proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the conservation of time. The total time consumed by all surgical cases and the associated turnover periods must not exceed the total scheduled time available in the Operating Room.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the provided data:\n- Let $N$ be the number of surgical cases, which must be a non-negative integer ($N \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$).\n- Let $T_{case}$ be the duration of a single surgical case, given as $T_{case} = 90$ minutes.\n- Let $T_{turnover}$ be the time required for room turnover between cases.\n- Let $T_{day}$ be the total scheduled length of the day.\n\nThe total time available in the day is given as $8$ hours. To maintain consistent units, we convert this to minutes:\n$$T_{day} = 8 \\text{ hours} \\times 60 \\frac{\\text{minutes}}{\\text{hour}} = 480 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe total time required for $N$ cases, denoted $T_{total}(N)$, is the sum of the total time for the surgeries and the total time for turnovers. Since there is no turnover after the final case, there are $N-1$ turnover periods for $N$ cases (for $N \\ge 1$). The total time is therefore:\n$$T_{total}(N) = N \\cdot T_{case} + (N-1) \\cdot T_{turnover}$$\nThis formula is valid for $N \\ge 1$. If $N=0$, the time used is $0$. If $N=1$, the time is $T_{case}$, which the formula correctly gives: $1 \\cdot T_{case} + (1-1) \\cdot T_{turnover} = T_{case}$.\n\nThe constraint is that the total time used must not be greater than the available time:\n$$N \\cdot T_{case} + (N-1) \\cdot T_{turnover} \\le T_{day}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the largest integer $N$ that satisfies this inequality for two different turnover times.\n\n**Scenario 1: Baseline Turnover**\n\nIn this scenario, the turnover time is $T_{turnover, 1} = 20$ minutes. Let $N_1$ be the maximum number of cases that can be completed. The governing inequality is:\n$$N_1 \\cdot 90 + (N_1 - 1) \\cdot 20 \\le 480$$\nWe solve for $N_1$:\n$$90N_1 + 20N_1 - 20 \\le 480$$\n$$110N_1 \\le 480 + 20$$\n$$110N_1 \\le 500$$\n$$N_1 \\le \\frac{500}{110} = \\frac{50}{11} \\approx 4.545$$\nSince $N_1$ must be an integer, the largest integer value satisfying this condition is the floor of the result:\n$$N_1 = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{50}{11} \\right\\rfloor = 4$$\nThus, a maximum of $4$ cases can be completed under the baseline conditions.\n\n**Scenario 2: Reduced Turnover**\n\nIn this scenario, the turnover time is reduced to $T_{turnover, 2} = 10$ minutes. Let $N_2$ be the maximum number of cases that can be completed. The governing inequality is:\n$$N_2 \\cdot 90 + (N_2 - 1) \\cdot 10 \\le 480$$\nWe solve for $N_2$:\n$$90N_2 + 10N_2 - 10 \\le 480$$\n$$100N_2 \\le 480 + 10$$\n$$100N_2 \\le 490$$\n$$N_2 \\le \\frac{490}{100} = 4.9$$\nSince $N_2$ must be an integer, the largest integer value satisfying this condition is:\n$$N_2 = \\lfloor 4.9 \\rfloor = 4$$\nThus, a maximum of $4$ cases can be completed even with the reduced turnover time.\n\n**Calculating the Increase in Cases**\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in the expected number of completed cases per day attributable to the reduction in turnover time. This is the difference between $N_2$ and $N_1$:\n$$\\Delta N = N_2 - N_1$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\\Delta N = 4 - 4 = 0$$\n\nDespite the efficiency gain saving time, it is not sufficient to allow for an additional complete surgical case within the $8$-hour day, due to the discrete nature of the problem. For $N=5$ cases with the reduced turnover, the total time required would be $5 \\times 90 + (5-1) \\times 10 = 450 + 40 = 490$ minutes, which exceeds the available $480$ minutes.",

            "problem": "A General Surgery Operating Room (OR) Manager must decide how to insert a time-critical emergency case into a predetermined full-day elective schedule while balancing downstream delays, overtime costs, and fairness across surgeons’ lists. There are three Operating Rooms (ORs) staffed and booked from 8:00 to 16:00 with a constant turnover of $15$ minutes between cases. The emergency case arrives at 10:30, requires $45$ minutes of OR time, and—if inserted—adds an additional $15$ minutes of turnover after the emergency before the next elective case can begin. The emergency cannot interrupt an ongoing case and must be placed immediately after the next turnover following the current case in the chosen room. Due to equipment compatibilities specific to the emergency, only Room 1 and Room 2 are clinically suitable options for insertion on this day (Room 3 is not eligible).\n\nThe preplanned elective schedules are as follows, with all turnovers of $15$ minutes already accounted for in planned start times:\n\n- Room 1 (Surgeon X), four cases:\n  - Case $1$: $120$ minutes (8:00 to 10:00)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (10:00 to 10:15)\n  - Case $2$: $100$ minutes (10:15 to 11:55)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (11:55 to 12:10)\n  - Case $3$: $125$ minutes (12:10 to 14:15)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (14:15 to 14:30)\n  - Case $4$: $90$ minutes (14:30 to 16:00)\n  The total planned occupancy is $480$ minutes, ending at 16:00 with no slack.\n\n- Room 2 (Surgeon Y), five cases:\n  - Case $1$: $80$ minutes (8:00 to 9:20)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (9:20 to 9:35)\n  - Case $2$: $115$ minutes (9:35 to 11:30)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (11:30 to 11:45)\n  - Case $3$: $90$ minutes (11:45 to 13:15)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (13:15 to 13:30)\n  - Case $4$: $70$ minutes (13:30 to 14:40)\n  - Turnover: $15$ minutes (14:40 to 14:55)\n  - Case $5$: $50$ minutes (14:55 to 15:45)\n  The total planned occupancy is $465$ minutes, ending at 15:45 with $15$ minutes of slack before 16:00.\n\n- Room 3 (Surgeon Z) is not available for the emergency today.\n\nUse the following foundational principles:\n- Deterministic flow-conservation: total occupancy equals the sum of all case durations plus turnover intervals.\n- Non-preemptive insertion: the emergency cannot interrupt an ongoing case and is inserted after the next turnover; it occupies the OR for $45$ minutes and causes an extra $15$-minute turnover thereafter. The insertion pushes all downstream start times in the chosen room by the same amount as the inserted block (emergency plus its post-emergency turnover).\n- Overtime is the excess occupancy beyond the scheduled day length of $480$ minutes. Staff Overtime Cost Rate is $c = \\$5$ per minute, applied only to overtime minutes.\n\nDefine fairness across surgeons’ lists as the aggregated downstream start-time delay (in minutes) inflicted on the affected surgeon’s list, computed as the sum of start-time delays across all downstream elective cases in that room.\n\nTasks:\n1) For Room 1 and Room 2 separately, compute the downstream start-time delay (in minutes) applied to each impacted case when the emergency is inserted at the earliest eligible point in that room, and then compute the aggregated fairness penalty $F_{i}$ (sum of downstream delays) for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\n2) Compute the overtime minutes $C_{i}$ and the corresponding overtime costs in dollars for $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\n3) Consider the prioritization rule that selects the room minimizing the composite objective $$J_{i}(w) = w \\cdot C_{i} + (1 - w) \\cdot F_{i},$$ where $w \\in [0,1]$ is a managerial weight that trades off overtime versus fairness, $C_{i}$ is measured in minutes of overtime, and $F_{i}$ is measured in minutes of aggregate downstream delay.

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is a well-posed, deterministic optimization problem. We can proceed with a systematic solution. The core of the problem is to calculate the consequences of inserting an emergency case into two different, pre-planned operating room schedules and then to find a specific parameter for a given objective function.\n\nLet us define a time coordinate system where $t=0$ corresponds to the start of the day at 8:00. The scheduled day ends at 16:00, which is $8$ hours or $480$ minutes later, so at $t=480$. The emergency case arrives at 10:30, which corresponds to $t = 150$ minutes.\n\nThe emergency case requires $45$ minutes of operating room time, followed by an additional $15$-minute turnover. This creates a total inserted time block of $\\Delta T = 45 + 15 = 60$ minutes. This insertion is non-preemptive, meaning it cannot start until the case currently in progress at the time of arrival is finished and the subsequent turnover is complete. The insertion of this $\\Delta T = 60$ minute block will delay the start time of all subsequent cases in that room by $60$ minutes.\n\nFirst, we will analyze the impact on Room 1 and Room 2 individually to compute the fairness penalty $F_i$ and overtime minutes $C_i$ for each room $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\n**Analysis for Room 1**\n\nAt the time of the emergency arrival, $t=150$ minutes (10:30), Room 1 is occupied with its second case, which runs from 10:15 ($t=135$) to 11:55 ($t=235$). According to the rules, we must wait for this case to finish. The turnover following this case is scheduled from 11:55 ($t=235$) to 12:10 ($t=250$). Therefore, the earliest point the emergency case can be inserted is at $t=250$.\n\nThe insertion of the $\\Delta T = 60$ minute block at $t=250$ delays all downstream cases. The downstream cases in Room 1 are Case $3$ and Case $4$.\nThe original start time of Case $3$ was 12:10 ($t=250$).\nThe original start time of Case $4$ was 14:30 ($t=390$).\nBoth cases are delayed by $\\Delta T = 60$ minutes.\nThe fairness penalty, $F_1$, is the sum of the delays for all downstream cases:\n$$F_1 = (\\text{delay for Case } 3) + (\\text{delay for Case } 4) = 60 + 60 = 120 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nTo calculate the overtime, $C_1$, we examine the schedule's end time. The original schedule for Room 1 was perfectly filled, ending at 16:00 ($t=480$) with no slack. The insertion of a $60$-minute block extends the total duration by $60$ minutes.\nThe new end time is 16:00 $+ 60$ minutes $= 17:00$, which is $t_{end,1} = 480 + 60 = 540$ minutes.\nOvertime is the time worked beyond the scheduled end of day at $t=480$.\n$$C_1 = t_{end,1} - 480 = 540 - 480 = 60 \\text{ minutes}$$\nThe associated overtime cost is $C_1 \\times c = 60 \\text{ min} \\times \\$5/\\text{min} = \\$300$.\n\n**Analysis for Room 2**\n\nAt $t=150$ minutes (10:30), Room 2 is occupied with its second case, running from 9:35 ($t=95$) to 11:30 ($t=210$). We must wait for this case to finish. The subsequent turnover is from 11:30 ($t=210$) to 11:45 ($t=225$). The earliest insertion point for the emergency case is at $t=225$.\n\nThe downstream cases in Room 2 are Case $3$, Case $4$, and Case $5$.\nThe original start time of Case $3$ was 11:45 ($t=225$).\nThe original start time of Case $4$ was 13:30 ($t=330$).\nThe original start time of Case $5$ was 14:55 ($t=415$).\nAll three cases are delayed by $\\Delta T = 60$ minutes.\nThe fairness penalty, $F_2$, is the sum of these delays:\n$$F_2 = (\\text{delay for Case } 3) + (\\text{delay for Case } 4) + (\\text{delay for Case } 5) = 60 + 60 + 60 = 180 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nTo calculate the overtime, $C_2$, we note that the original Room 2 schedule ended at 15:45 ($t=465$), which is $15$ minutes before the official end of the day at 16:00 ($t=480$). This represents a slack of $15$ minutes. The insertion of the $60$-minute block extends the schedule's end time to 15:45 $+ 60$ minutes $= 16:45$.\nThe new end time is $t_{end,2} = 465 + 60 = 525$ minutes.\nOvertime is the time worked beyond $t=480$:\n$$C_2 = t_{end,2} - 480 = 525 - 480 = 45 \\text{ minutes}$$\nThis is equivalent to the inserted time block minus the available slack: $60 - 15 = 45$ minutes.\nThe associated overtime cost is $C_2 \\times c = 45 \\text{ min} \\times \\$5/\\text{min} = \\$225$.\n\n**Calculation of the Break-even Weight $w^{\\star}$**\n\nThe manager is indifferent between Room 1 and Room 2 when the composite objective function $J_i(w)$ is equal for both rooms. The objective function is given by:\n$$J_{i}(w) = w \\cdot C_{i} + (1 - w) \\cdot F_{i}$$\nThe break-even weight $w^{\\star}$ is found by setting $J_1(w^{\\star}) = J_2(w^{\\star})$.\n$$w^{\\star} \\cdot C_{1} + (1 - w^{\\star}) \\cdot F_{1} = w^{\\star} \\cdot C_{2} + (1 - w^{\\star}) \\cdot F_{2}$$\nWe substitute the calculated values: $C_1 = 60$, $F_1 = 120$, $C_2 = 45$, and $F_2 = 180$.\n$$w^{\\star} \\cdot 60 + (1 - w^{\\star}) \\cdot 120 = w^{\\star} \\cdot 45 + (1 - w^{\\star}) \\cdot 180$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$60w^{\\star} + 120 - 120w^{\\star} = 45w^{\\star} + 180 - 180w^{\\star}$$\nSimplifying both sides:\n$$120 - 60w^{\\star} = 180 - 135w^{\\star}$$\nNow, we solve for $w^{\\star}$ by isolating the variable:\n$$135w^{\\star} - 60w^{\\star} = 180 - 120$$\n$$75w^{\\star} = 60$$\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{60}{75}$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final answer:\n$$w^{\\star} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 15}{5 \\cdot 15} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nThe numerical value is $0.8$. This is the weight on overtime minutes at which the composite cost-fairness score is identical for both rooms.",
