This calculation is not merely a formality; it is the foundation upon which the trial's ability to detect a true treatment effect rests. This exercise guides you through the process of deriving and calculating the sample size for a trial with a binary outcome, such as the presence or absence of a complication, which is a frequent scenario in surgical research.",

            "problem": "A parallel-group randomized controlled trial (RCT) in general surgery will compare a novel mass-closure technique for midline laparotomy to the standard closure, with the binary primary outcome being the occurrence of an incisional hernia by $12$ months. Let $p_1$ denote the event probability in the standard arm and $p_2$ the event probability in the novel technique arm. Investigators plan a superiority design with a two-sided Type I error rate $\\alpha = 0.05$ and target power $1-\\beta = 0.80$ to detect a clinically important reduction from $p_1 = 0.20$ to $p_2 = 0.10$. Allocation will be equal, so each arm will have the same sample size. Assume outcomes are independent and identically distributed within arms and that the large-sample normal approximation to independent binomial proportions applies; neglect continuity corrections, stratification effects, and attrition.\n\nStarting from first principles—namely, the binomial model for event counts, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for sample proportions, and the classical two-sample $z$-test for the difference in proportions with a pooled variance under the null—derive a closed-form expression for the minimum total sample size across both arms required to achieve the specified $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for a two-sided superiority test with margin $0$. Then evaluate this expression at the parameter values given above. For quantiles of the standard normal distribution, use $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = 1.960$ and $z_{1-\\beta} = 0.8416$ (both taken to four significant figures).

The problem is statistically well-posed and contains all necessary information.\n\nLet $p_1$ and $p_2$ be the true event probabilities in the standard and novel technique arms, respectively. Let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be the sample sizes in each arm. The allocation is equal, so $n_1 = n_2 = n$, and the total sample size is $N = 2n$.

We reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the $1-\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.

For the sample size calculation, we consider the specific alternative where $p_1 = 0.20$ and $p_2 = 0.10$.

We assume a simple variance components model where the total variation in the outcome can be partitioned into two sources: variation between clusters and variation within clusters.\nThe total variance of a single observation is $\\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \\sigma^2$. This total variance can be decomposed as $\\sigma^2 = \\sigma_b^2 + \\sigma_w^2$, where $\\sigma_b^2$ is the between-cluster variance and $\\sigma_w^2$ is the within-cluster variance.\n\nThe intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC), denoted by $\\rho$, is defined as the proportion of the total variance that is due to the variation between clusters. Mathematically, this is:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{\\sigma_b^2 + \\sigma_w^2} = \\frac{\\sigma_b^2}{\\sigma^2} $$\nThe ICC also represents the correlation between outcomes of two distinct individuals, $j$ and $l$, within the same cluster $i$:\n$$ \\rho = \\text{Corr}(Y_{ij}, Y_{il}) \\quad \\text{for } j \\neq l $$\nFrom this, the covariance between two subjects in the same cluster is $\\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{il}) = \\rho \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(Y_{ij})\\text{Var}(Y_{il})} = \\rho \\sigma^2$.\n\nNow, consider one arm of the trial with $k$ clusters and a uniform size of $m$ patients per cluster. The total sample size in this arm is $n = k \\times m$. The sample mean outcome for this arm is $\\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}$.\n\nThe variance of this sample mean is:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{km} \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(km)^2} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) $$\nSince patients in different clusters are independent, the variance of the sum over all patients is the sum of the variances of the cluster-level totals:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) $$\nLet's compute the variance of a single cluster total, $\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}$:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m} \\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) + \\sum_{j \\neq l} \\text{Cov}(Y_{ij}, Y_{il}) $$\nThere are $m$ variance terms and $m(m-1)$ covariance terms. Substituting the expressions for variance and covariance:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = m \\sigma^2 + m(m-1) \\rho \\sigma^2 = m \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nSince there are $k$ such independent clusters:\n$$ \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{j=1}^{m} Y_{ij}\\right) = k \\left( m \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] \\right) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the variance of the sample mean:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) = \\frac{1}{(km)^2} \\left( k m \\sigma^2 [1 + (m-1)\\rho] \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{km} [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nRecalling that $n=km$ is the total number of subjects in the arm:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (m-1)\\rho] $$\nIn contrast, for an individually randomized trial (which is equivalent to a simple random sample), the observations are independent, meaning $\\rho=0$. The variance of the sample mean for a sample of size $n$ would be:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{SRS}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} $$\nThe variance inflation factor (VIF), or design effect ($D$), is the ratio of the variance of the mean under cluster randomization to the variance of the mean under simple random sampling for the same total sample size $n$.\n$$ D = \\frac{\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}})}{\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{SRS}})} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} [1 + (m-1)\\rho]}{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} $$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the design effect under equal cluster sizes:\n$$ D = 1 + (m-1)\\rho $$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of Sample Size Inflation**\n\nThe statistical power of a study comparing two arms is a function of the sample size, the effect size, the significance level, and the variance of the estimator for the treatment effect. For a comparison of two means, the estimator is the difference in sample means, and its variance is the sum of the variances of the means in each arm (assuming independence between arms).\n\nLet $n_0$ be the per-arm sample size required in an individually randomized trial to achieve a desired power. The variance of the estimated treatment effect is proportional to $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_0} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_0} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n_0}$. The sample size $n_0$ is calculated to make this variance small enough to detect the target effect size with the specified power.\n\nIn a cluster randomized trial, the variance of the per-arm sample mean is inflated by the design effect, $D$. If we were to use the same per-arm sample size $n_0$, the variance of the mean would be $\\text{Var}(\\bar{Y}_{\\text{cluster}}) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n_0} D$. The variance of the estimated treatment effect would become $\\frac{\\sigma^2 D}{n_0} + \\frac{\\sigma^2 D}{n_0} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2 D}{n_0}$. Since $D > 1$ (for $\\rho > 0$ and $m>1$), this variance is larger than in the individually randomized trial, leading to a loss of statistical power.\n\nTo restore the power to the originally planned level, the variance of the effect estimate in the clustered trial must be made equal to the variance in the individually randomized trial. Let $n_{\\text{arm}}$ be the required per-arm sample size for the cluster trial. We must satisfy:\n$$ \\text{Var}_{\\text{cluster}} = \\text{Var}_{\\text{SRS}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2\\sigma^2 D}{n_{\\text{arm}}} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n_0} $$\nSolving for $n_{\\text{arm}}$ gives:\n$$ n_{\\text{arm}} = D \\times n_0 $$\nThis demonstrates that the sample size from an individual randomization calculation ($n_0$) must be multiplied by the design effect ($D$) to obtain the required per-arm sample size in a cluster randomized trial ($n_{\\text{arm}}$) that preserves the same variance of the treatment effect estimate, and therefore, the same statistical power.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of Total Sample Size**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Per-arm sample size for an individually randomized design: $n_0 = 250$\n- Average (assumed to be constant) cluster size: $m = 21$\n- Intracluster correlation coefficient: $\\rho = 0.05$\n\nFirst, we compute the design effect, $D$:\n$$ D = 1 + (m-1)\\rho $$\n$$ D = 1 + (21-1) \\times 0.05 = 1 + (20) \\times 0.05 = 1 + 1 = 2 $$\nNext, we compute the inflated sample size required for each arm of the cluster randomized trial, $n_{\\text{arm}}$:\n$$ n_{\\text{arm}} = D \\times n_0 = 2 \\times 250 = 500 $$\nEach of the two arms (intervention and usual care) requires $500$ participants.\nFinally, the total required sample size for the entire trial is the sum of the sample sizes for both arms:\n$$ N_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\times n_{\\text{arm}} = 2 \\times 500 = 1000 $$\nThe total required sample size for the cluster randomized trial is $1000$ participants.",

            "solution": "We begin from first principles relevant to randomization in a stratified multicenter surgical trial.\n\nRandomization principle: To prevent selection bias, treatment assignment must be independent of investigator choice and patient prognosis. Stratification ensures balance on prognostic factors by running separate randomization processes per stratum. With two arms and equal allocation $1:1$, short-term balance is achieved via permuted blocks. For a block size $b$, equal allocation within the block requires that $b$ be divisible by the number of arms $k$. With $k=2$, valid block sizes satisfy $b = 2m$, $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$.\n\nAllocation concealment: Predictability increases when block sizes are fixed and small; knowing prior allocations can allow investigators to guess the next assignment. Variable block sizes, unknown to sites and randomly ordered, reduce predictability while maintaining balance.\n\nStratum-specific lists: Independent lists for each stratum $(\\text{center} \\times \\text{risk})$ prevent cross-stratum interference and ensure within-stratum balance. For small strata (e.g., $n=20$), block sizes must be chosen such that sums of blocks cover the expected accrual, but the system should support incomplete final blocks without creating large imbalances.\n\nNow analyze each option:\n\nOption A:\n- Stratification: Uses only $2$ strata (low vs high) pooled across centers. The requirement explicitly states stratification by center and baseline risk, yielding $8$ strata. Pooling across centers ignores center effects (a known prognostic and operational factor in multicenter surgery trials).\n- Block size validity: $b=4$ is divisible by $2$, so per-block balance is possible.\n- Randomization list example: The sequence for $C_3\\text{-High}$ is taken from a global list, not from an independent $C_3\\text{-High}$ stratum-specific list. This violates the requirement for independent lists per stratum. Therefore, despite a valid block size, the scheme fails the stratification requirement.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption B:\n- Stratification: Uses the required $8$ strata ($C_1$–$C_4$ by low/high). This satisfies the need to balance within center and risk categories.\n- Block sizes: Variable block sizes $\\{4, 6, 8\\}$ are each divisible by $2$ (the number of arms), so each block can contain equal numbers of $L$ and $O$. Variable sizes reduce predictability while ensuring balance within blocks. Larger blocks like $8$ are acceptable in larger strata (e.g., $60$), and smaller ones like $4$–$6$ are appropriate for smaller strata (e.g., $20$–$25$).\n- Concealment: Centralized web-based allocation hides upcoming assignments and the block sizes, meeting concealment requirements.\n- Example list for $C_3\\text{-High}$ with $20$ participants: The proposed composition $6$–$8$–$6$ sums to $20$. Inspect block contents:\n  - Block $1$ ($6$): $L, L, O, O, L, O$ has $3$ $L$ and $3$ $O$.\n  - Block $2$ ($8$): $O, L, L, O, O, L, L, O$ has $4$ $L$ and $4$ $O$.\n  - Block $3$ ($6$): $O, L, O, L, O, L$ has $3$ $L$ and $3$ $O$.\n  Across the full list, total $L=10$ and total $O=10$, achieving $1:1$ balance within the stratum while maintaining per-block balance and reduced predictability.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption C:\n- Stratification: Uses the required $8$ strata.\n- Block size: Fixed $b=2$ is divisible by $2$, so per-block balance is possible.\n- Predictability and concealment: A fixed block size of $2$ with a repeated pattern (e.g., $L, O$) is highly predictable. After observing one assignment within the block and knowing the fixed size and pattern, the next assignment is easily guessed, increasing risk of selection bias and violating concealment intent. While central systems can conceal lists, the structure itself is too predictable, particularly in small strata.\n- Example list: The repeated $L, O$ pattern confirms high predictability.\nVerdict: Incorrect due to predictability concerns; it does not adequately minimize predictability.\n\nOption D:\n- Stratification: Uses the required $8$ strata.\n- Block sizes: Proposed variable block sizes $\\{3, 5\\}$ are not divisible by $2$. With equal allocation $1:1$ and $k=2$, $b$ must satisfy $b=2m$. For $b=3$ or $b=5$, one cannot have equal numbers of $L$ and $O$ within each block, violating the definition of permuted block randomization for equal allocation.\n- Example list: The sequences given show blocks that do not contain equal numbers of $L$ and $O$ (e.g., $L, O, O$ has $1$ $L$ and $2$ $O$). This induces systematic imbalance within blocks and undermines short-term balance.\nVerdict: Incorrect because block sizes are invalid for equal allocation and cause imbalance.\n\nOption E:\n- Stratification: Minimization can incorporate center and baseline risk, but the requirement is specifically \"permuted block randomization\" with specified block sizes and lists. Minimization is a different allocation algorithm (a dynamic, adaptive method) and does not construct pre-specified block-based randomization lists.\n- Randomization lists: Not pre-specified; therefore, the scheme does not meet the directive to specify block sizes and randomization lists.\nVerdict: Incorrect due to mismatch with required method.\n\nConclusion: Option B is the only scheme that satisfies stratification by center and risk, uses valid variable block sizes to ensure per-block balance and reduce predictability, provides independent lists per stratum with centralized concealment, and presents a valid example list for the $C_3\\text{-High}$ stratum totaling $20$ with $1:1$ balance.",
