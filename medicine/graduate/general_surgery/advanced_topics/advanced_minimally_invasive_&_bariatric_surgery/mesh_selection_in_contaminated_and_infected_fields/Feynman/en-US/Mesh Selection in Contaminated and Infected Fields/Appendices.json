The concept of mesh overlap is a standard and critical component of the procedure to prevent recurrence. The dimensions of the defect and the required overlap are clinically realistic. The geometric calculation is based on fundamental and correct mathematical principles. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information: the dimensions of the initial defect and a clear, unambiguous rule for determining the dimensions of the surgical mesh. This allows for the calculation of a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise, technical, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements. It describes a procedural calculation in a medical context.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed invalidity flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial. It is a straightforward application of geometric principles to a real-world surgical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution\nLet the dimensions of the rectangular abdominal wall defect be denoted by $w_d$ and $h_d$. From the problem statement, we are given:\n$$w_d = 10\\,\\text{cm}$$\n$$h_d = 12\\,\\text{cm}$$\nThe surgical plan specifies a uniform circumferential overlap, denoted by $o$, of:\n$$o = 5\\,\\text{cm}$$\nThe mesh is to be cut as a rectangle with its edges parallel to the defect's axes. According to the provided surgical principle, a circumferential overlap of $o$ increases each linear dimension of the defect by $2o$ to determine the final dimensions of the mesh. This is because the overlap is applied to both sides of each axis. For the width, the overlap is added to the left and right sides. For the height, the overlap is added to the superior and inferior sides.\n\nThe width of the mesh, $w_m$, is therefore the width of the defect plus twice the overlap:\n$$w_m = w_d + 2o$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$w_m = 10\\,\\text{cm} + 2 \\times 5\\,\\text{cm} = 10\\,\\text{cm} + 10\\,\\text{cm} = 20\\,\\text{cm}$$\nSimilarly, the height of the mesh, $h_m$, is the height of the defect plus twice the overlap:\n$$h_m = h_d + 2o$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$h_m = 12\\,\\text{cm} + 2 \\times 5\\,\\text{cm} = 12\\,\\text{cm} + 10\\,\\text{cm} = 22\\,\\text{cm}$$\nThe required area of the mesh, $A_m$, is determined by the fundamental geometric formula for the area of a rectangle, $A = w \\times h$. Thus:\n$$A_m = w_m \\times h_m$$\nSubstituting the calculated mesh dimensions:\n$$A_m = (20\\,\\text{cm}) \\times (22\\,\\text{cm})$$\nPerforming the multiplication gives the final area:\n$$A_m = 440\\,\\text{cm}^2$$\nThe required mesh area is $440$ square centimeters.",

To guide this decision, the surgeon estimates the probability of postoperative Surgical Site Infection (SSI).

Consider that the baseline SSI probability in contaminated fields without smoking or diabetes is $p_{0} = 0.25$.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in biostatistics, using established definitions of odds, odds ratios, and their relationship to probability. All necessary data and assumptions (e.g., independence of risk factors) are explicitly provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem requires calculating an adjusted probability of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) for a patient with multiple risk factors, starting from a baseline probability and odds ratios (ORs) for each factor. The core principle is that odds ratios act multiplicatively on the odds, not on the probabilities themselves. The solution process involves three main steps:\n1.  Convert the baseline probability to baseline odds.\n2.  Calculate the adjusted odds by multiplying the baseline odds by the OR for each independent risk factor.\n3.  Convert the adjusted odds back to a probability.\n\nFirst, we define the relationship between probability, $p$, and odds, $O$. The odds of an event are given by the formula:\n$$O = \\frac{p}{1-p}$$\nConversely, the probability can be derived from the odds using the formula:\n$$p = \\frac{O}{1+O}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n-   The baseline SSI probability for a patient in a contaminated field without smoking or diabetes is $p_{0} = 0.25$.\n-   The odds ratio for smoking is $OR_{\\text{smoke}} = 1.6$.\n-   The odds ratio for diabetes is $OR_{\\text{diabetes}} = 1.5$.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the baseline odds, $O_0$, corresponding to the baseline probability $p_0$.\n$$O_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.25}{1-0.25} = \\frac{0.25}{0.75} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\n\nStep 2: Calculate the adjusted odds, $O_{\\text{adj}}$, for a patient who both smokes and has diabetes.
