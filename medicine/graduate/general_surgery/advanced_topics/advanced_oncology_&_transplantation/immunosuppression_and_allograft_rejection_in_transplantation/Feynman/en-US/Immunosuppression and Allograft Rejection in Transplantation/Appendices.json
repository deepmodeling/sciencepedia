This exercise guides you through the calculation of the calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA), the standard metric used to predict the likelihood of finding a compatible donor.

            "problem": "An adult kidney transplant candidate has developed circulating immunoglobulin G antibodies against selected Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens, rendering those antigens unacceptable for donor selection. The calculated Panel Reactive Antibody (cPRA) is used to quantify the fraction of potential donors in the relevant pool who would be immunologically incompatible solely due to expression of any unacceptable antigen. In the context of general surgery and transplantation immunology, start from the following foundational facts:\n- Allograft antibody-mediated rejection occurs when the recipient has preformed donor-specific antibodies targeting donor HLA antigens present on vascular endothelium and other graft cells, leading to complement activation and graft injury.\n- A donor is immunologically incompatible if they express any antigen that the recipient has designated as unacceptable; compatibility requires that the donor express none of the unacceptable antigens.\n- Each HLA locus (for example, HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-DR) is diploid; donors carry two alleles per locus.\n- In a large, randomly mating donor population at Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for each locus, and assuming independence across loci (no linkage disequilibrium between loci for the purpose of this calculation), alleles at a locus are sampled independently according to their population frequencies.\n\nThe candidate’s unacceptable antigen list is:\n- HLA-A: A02 and A24.\n- HLA-B: B07.\n- HLA-DR: DR4 and DR7.\n\nIn the donor population relevant to this candidate’s allocation region, the antigen (allele) frequencies are:\n- HLA-A02 frequency $0.26$, HLA-A24 frequency $0.10$.\n- HLA-B07 frequency $0.09$.\n- HLA-DR4 frequency $0.20$, HLA-DR7 frequency $0.10$.\n\nUsing only the fundamental probabilistic reasoning implied by the facts above, derive an expression for the probability that a random donor from this population would be compatible with the candidate, then use it to compute the cPRA. Express the final cPRA as a decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures. Finally, interpret the clinical implications of the computed cPRA in terms of expected donor availability and peri-transplant immunosuppression strategy, grounded in principles of allograft rejection and transplant allocation. Do not use a percent sign anywhere in your answer.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of transplantation immunology and population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) and provides a complete and consistent set of data and definitions required for a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe central task is to compute the calculated Panel Reactive Antibody ($cPRA$), which represents the probability that a randomly selected donor from a given population will be immunologically incompatible with the transplant candidate. A donor is defined as incompatible if they express any of the recipient's listed unacceptable Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA). Conversely, a donor is compatible only if they express none of the unacceptable antigens.\n\nThe problem can be solved by first calculating the probability of compatibility, $P(\\text{compatible})$, and then finding its complement, as the $cPRA$ is the probability of incompatibility.\n$$ \\text{cPRA} = P(\\text{incompatible}) = 1 - P(\\text{compatible}) $$\nThe problem states that the HLA loci (A, B, DR) can be considered independent. This allows for the total probability of compatibility to be calculated as the product of the probabilities of compatibility at each individual locus:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = P(\\text{A-locus compatible}) \\times P(\\text{B-locus compatible}) \\times P(\\text{DR-locus compatible}) $$\nWe will now calculate the probability of compatibility for each locus separately. According to the stated principles, a donor is diploid, possessing two alleles at each locus. A donor is compatible at a given locus if and only if **neither** of their two alleles corresponds to an unacceptable antigen for that locus. The alleles are drawn independently from the gene pool according to their population frequencies.\n\nLet $f_{\\text{allele}}$ denote the frequency of a given allele in the population. The probability that a single, randomly drawn allele is **not** a specific unacceptable allele $i$ is $(1 - f_i)$. If a locus has multiple unacceptable alleles (e.g., $i$, $j$), the probability that a single randomly drawn allele is **not** any of them is $(1 - (f_i + f_j))$, assuming alleles are mutually exclusive. For a donor to be compatible at a locus, both of their alleles must be acceptable. Therefore, the probability of compatibility at a locus with a set of unacceptable alleles $U$ is:\n$$ P(\\text{locus compatible}) = \\left(1 - \\sum_{i \\in U} f_i\\right)^2 $$\n\nNow we apply this to the given data.\n\n**1. HLA-A Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigens are A02 and A24. The corresponding allele frequencies are $f_{A02} = 0.26$ and $f_{A24} = 0.10$.\nThe total frequency of unacceptable alleles at the HLA-A locus is the sum of the individual frequencies:\n$$ f_{\\text{A,unacceptable}} = f_{A02} + f_{A24} = 0.26 + 0.10 = 0.36 $$\nThe probability that a single allele at this locus is acceptable is $(1 - 0.36) = 0.64$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-A locus (i.e., both of their A-locus alleles are acceptable) is:\n$$ P(\\text{A-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{A02} - f_{A24})^2 = (1 - 0.36)^2 = (0.64)^2 = 0.4096 $$\n\n**2. HLA-B Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigen is B07, with a frequency of $f_{B07} = 0.09$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-B locus is:\n$$ P(\\text{B-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{B07})^2 = (1 - 0.09)^2 = (0.91)^2 = 0.8281 $$\n\n**3. HLA-DR Locus Compatibility**\nThe unacceptable antigens are DR4 and DR7. The corresponding allele frequencies are $f_{DR4} = 0.20$ and $f_{DR7} = 0.10$.\nThe total frequency of unacceptable alleles at the HLA-DR locus is:\n$$ f_{\\text{DR,unacceptable}} = f_{DR4} + f_{DR7} = 0.20 + 0.10 = 0.30 $$\nThe probability that a single allele at this locus is acceptable is $(1 - 0.30) = 0.70$.\nThe probability that a donor is compatible at the HLA-DR locus is:\n$$ P(\\text{DR-locus compatible}) = (1 - f_{DR4} - f_{DR7})^2 = (1 - 0.30)^2 = (0.70)^2 = 0.49 $$\n\n**4. Overall Compatibility and cPRA Calculation**\nThe derived expression for the probability that a random donor is compatible is:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = (1 - f_{A02} - f_{A24})^2 (1 - f_{B07})^2 (1 - f_{DR4} - f_{DR7})^2 $$\nSubstituting the calculated values for each locus:\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) = 0.4096 \\times 0.8281 \\times 0.49 $$\n$$ P(\\text{compatible}) \\approx 0.16621239 $$\nNow, we can compute the $cPRA$:\n$$ \\text{cPRA} = 1 - P(\\text{compatible}) = 1 - 0.16621239 = 0.83378761 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ \\text{cPRA} \\approx 0.8338 $$\n\n**5. Clinical Implications**\nA $cPRA$ value of $0.8338$ indicates that the patient is highly sensitized. Approximately $83.4\\%$ of potential donors in the relevant donor pool are predicted to be immunologically incompatible due to the patient's pre-existing anti-HLA antibodies.\n\n*   **Donor Availability:** This high level of sensitization severely restricts the pool of suitable donors, leaving only an estimated $1 - 0.8338 = 0.1662$, or about $16.6\\%$, as potentially compatible. Consequently, the patient is expected to have a significantly prolonged waiting time on the transplant list for a compatible deceased donor kidney. Access to living donors also becomes more challenging. They are often enrolled in kidney paired donation programs to find a compatible match.\n\n*   **Peri-transplant Immunosuppression Strategy:** The patient is at a very high risk for antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), which is a major cause of early and late allograft failure. The management strategy must be aggressive:\n    *   **Desensitization:** Pre-transplant protocols may be required to reduce the levels of circulating donor-specific antibodies (DSAs). These therapies can include plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption to physically remove antibodies, combined with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and/or targeted agents like rituximab (an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody to deplete B cells) or bortezomib (a proteasome inhibitor to target plasma cells).\n    *   **Induction Therapy:** At the time of transplant, a potent induction immunosuppressive agent is mandatory. This typically involves a lymphocyte-depleting agent such as anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) rather than a non-depleting IL-$2$ receptor antagonist.\n    *   **Maintenance and Monitoring:** Post-transplant, the patient will require an aggressive maintenance immunosuppression regimen, usually a triple therapy consisting of a calcineurin inhibitor (e.g., tacrolimus), an anti-proliferative agent (e.g., mycophenolate mofetil), and corticosteroids. Furthermore, vigilant post-transplant monitoring for the development of de novo DSAs and for subclinical AMR through protocol biopsies and serological surveillance is essential to ensure long-term graft survival. The high-risk status persists even if a crossmatch-negative donor is found, due to the potential for an anamnestic (memory) immune response.",

Early post-transplant, the institutional protocol specifies a target tacrolimus trough concentration of $C_{\\text{target}}=9.0$ in nanograms per milliliter to balance rejection risk and nephrotoxicity.

The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe derivation is based on the principles of linear, first-order pharmacokinetics at steady state. At steady state, the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination.\n\nLet $D$ be the dose administered per dosing interval $\\tau$. Let $F$ be the bioavailability of the drug. The rate of drug administration, or Rate In, averaged over one dosing interval is given by:\n$$ \\text{Rate In} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau} $$\n\nThe rate of drug elimination, or Rate Out, for a drug following first-order kinetics is proportional to its plasma concentration, $C(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the drug's total clearance, $CL$.\n$$ \\text{Rate Out}(t) = CL \\cdot C(t) $$\nAt steady state, the average rate of elimination over a dosing interval must equal the average rate of administration. The average rate of elimination is $CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg}$, where $C_{ss,avg}$ is the average drug concentration at steady state.\n$$ \\text{Rate Out}_{ss,avg} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\n\nEquating the rate in and the average rate out at steady state:\n$$ \\frac{F \\cdot D}{\\tau} = CL \\cdot C_{ss,avg} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the average steady-state concentration:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau} $$\nThe quantity $D/\\tau$ is the dosing rate. The total daily dose, $TDD$, is related to the dose $D$ and interval $\\tau$ by $TDD = D \\cdot (24 \\text{ hours} / \\tau)$. Thus, the dosing rate can be expressed as $D/\\tau = TDD / (24 \\text{ hours})$. Substituting this into the equation for $C_{ss,avg}$ yields:\n$$ C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot TDD}{CL \\cdot (24 \\text{ hours})} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given patient, where $F$ and $CL$ are assumed constant, the average steady-state concentration is directly proportional to the total daily dose, $TDD$.\n\nIn linear pharmacokinetics, all concentration measures at steady state (e.g., peak, trough, average) are directly proportional to the dosing rate. Therefore, the trough concentration at steady state, $C_{ss,trough}$, is also directly proportional to the total daily dose, $TDD$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$ C_{ss,trough} = k \\cdot TDD $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality that incorporates the patient's individual pharmacokinetic parameters ($F$, $CL$, volume of distribution $V_d$) and the dosing interval $\\tau$. Since the problem specifies that the formulation (which affects $F$), clearance $CL$, and dosing interval $\\tau$ are unchanged, the value of $k$ remains constant for this patient between the two dosing regimens.\n\nWe can apply this relationship to both the current and the desired (target) states.
