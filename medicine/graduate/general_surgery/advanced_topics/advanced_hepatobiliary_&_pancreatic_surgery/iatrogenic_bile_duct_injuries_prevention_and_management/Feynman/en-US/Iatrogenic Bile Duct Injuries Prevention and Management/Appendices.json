To compare the relative odds of experiencing a major bile duct injury between these two indications, use the core definitions from clinical epidemiology for odds and the odds ratio, treating each operation as an independent Bernoulli trial and using pooled counts across centers.\n\nOver the study period, there were $n_{A} = 2400$ operations performed for acute cholecystitis, with a reported major bile duct injury frequency of $7.5$ per $1000$ operations. In the same period, there were $n_{E} = 12000$ operations for elective cholelithiasis, with a reported major bile duct injury frequency of $1.5$ per $1000$ operations. Assume the reported frequencies apply exactly to the stated counts.\n\nCompute the odds ratio of major bile duct injury for operations done for acute cholecystitis versus elective cholelithiasis.

It uses standard, well-defined concepts from epidemiology (odds, odds ratio) and applies them to a realistic clinical scenario in surgery. The data are plausible for a multicenter registry.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and clear definitions to calculate a unique numerical answer. The instruction to assume exact frequencies removes any ambiguity in determining the number of events.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated objectively, using quantitative data and established terminology.\n4.  **Consistency:** The provided data are internally consistent. The number of injury events calculated from the frequencies and total operations results in integer values for both groups, which is a necessary condition for discrete counts.\n    -   Acute group injuries: $2400 \\times \\frac{7.5}{1000} = 18$.\n    -   Elective group injuries: $12000 \\times \\frac{1.5}{1000} = 18$.\n    Both are integers, confirming the consistency of the problem setup.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the odds ratio ($OR$) for major bile duct injury, comparing operations for acute cholecystitis (the \"exposed\" group) to those for elective cholelithiasis (the \"unexposed\" group).\n\nLet's define the groups and outcomes:\n-   Group A: Acute cholecystitis cohort.\n-   Group E: Elective cholelithiasis cohort.\n-   Event ($D$): A patient experiences a major bile duct injury.\n-   No Event ($H$): A patient does not experience a major bile duct injury.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the number of patients with and without the event in each group.\n\nFor Group A (Acute Cholecystitis):\n-   Total number of operations, $n_A = 2400$.\n-   Injury frequency is $7.5$ per $1000$ operations, which corresponds to a probability of injury, $p_A = \\frac{7.5}{1000} = 0.0075$.\n-   Number of patients with injury (events), $d_A = n_A \\times p_A = 2400 \\times 0.0075 = 18$.\n-   Number of patients without injury (no events), $h_A = n_A - d_A = 2400 - 18 = 2382$.\n\nFor Group E (Elective Cholelithiasis):\n-   Total number of operations, $n_E = 12000$.\n-   Injury frequency is $1.5$ per $1000$ operations, which corresponds to a probability of injury, $p_E = \\frac{1.5}{1000} = 0.0015$.\n-   Number of patients with injury (events), $d_E = n_E \\times p_E = 12000 \\times 0.0015 = 18$.\n-   Number of patients without injury (no events), $h_E = n_E - d_E = 12000 - 18 = 11982$.\n\nThe odds of an event in a group is the ratio of the number of individuals who experience the event to the number of individuals who do not.\n\nThe odds of injury in Group A are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_A = \\frac{d_A}{h_A} = \\frac{18}{2382}\n$$\n\nThe odds of injury in Group E are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_E = \\frac{d_E}{h_E} = \\frac{18}{11982}\n$$\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds in the exposed group (Group A) to the odds in the unexposed group (Group E).\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_A}{\\text{Odds}_E}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the odds:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{d_A}{h_A}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{d_E}{h_E}\\right)} = \\frac{d_A \\times h_E}{d_E \\times h_A}\n$$\nThis is the standard cross-product ratio from a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table. Now, we substitute the calculated values:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{18 \\times 11982}{18 \\times 2382}\n$$\nThe term $18$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nOR = \\frac{11982}{2382}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nOR \\approx 5.030226699...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $5$, $0$, $3$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down. The trailing zero is significant and must be retained.\n$$\nOR \\approx 5.030\n$$\nThis means the odds of a major bile duct injury in a patient undergoing cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis are approximately $5.030$ times the odds of the same injury in a patient undergoing an elective procedure for cholelithiasis.",

            "problem": "A hepatobiliary surgery team performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy uses Intraoperative Cholangiography (IOC) to reduce the risk of iatrogenic bile duct injuries. Define a major bile duct injury as transection or significant thermal devascularization of the common bile duct or common hepatic duct that necessitates biliary reconstruction. Prior to IOC, the team’s structured risk assessment yields a pre-test probability of a major bile duct injury of $P(M) = 0.004$ for the current patient, where $M$ denotes the event that a major bile duct injury is present and $\\neg M$ denotes its absence. The IOC is interpreted in three categories: positive (definite injury), equivocal (uncertain or incomplete opacification), and negative (no injury). From validation data in a comparable operative setting, the conditional probabilities of IOC interpretation are:\n- Given a true major bile duct injury ($M$): $P(\\text{positive} \\mid M) = 0.70$, $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) = 0.20$, $P(\\text{negative} \\mid M) = 0.10$.\n- Given no major bile duct injury ($\\neg M$): $P(\\text{positive} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.05$, $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.10$, $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.85$.\n\nAssuming the IOC interpretation arises from the same data-generating process as the validation cohort and that the pre-test probability $P(M)$ applies to the present case, calculate the posterior probability $P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal})$, that is, the probability of a major bile duct injury given an equivocal IOC result.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The event of a major bile duct injury is denoted by $M$.\n- The pre-test probability of a major bile duct injury is $P(M) = 0.004$.\n- The event of no major bile duct injury is denoted by $\\neg M$.\n- Intraoperative Cholangiography (IOC) has three interpretation outcomes: positive, equivocal, negative.\n- Conditional probabilities of IOC interpretation given a major bile duct injury ($M$):\n  - $P(\\text{positive} \\mid M) = 0.70$\n  - $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) = 0.20$\n  - $P(\\text{negative} \\mid M) = 0.10$\n- Conditional probabilities of IOC interpretation given no major bile duct injury ($\\neg M$):\n  - $P(\\text{positive} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.05$\n  - $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.10$\n  - $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.85$\n- The objective is to calculate the posterior probability $P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal})$.\n- The final answer must be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing the standard Bayesian framework for updating probabilities based on diagnostic test results, a fundamental concept in medical statistics and decision theory. The context is realistic within general surgery. The problem is well-posed, as it provides all necessary information to calculate the required posterior probability.

The problem is self-contained and mathematically sound.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of a major bile duct injury ($M$) given that the Intraoperative Cholangiography (IOC) result is equivocal. This is denoted as $P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal})$. We will use Bayes' theorem, which is stated as:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nIn the context of this problem, event $A$ is the presence of a major injury, $M$, and event $B$ is an equivocal IOC result, which we denote as 'equivocal'. Thus, the formula becomes:\n$$P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal}) = \\frac{P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) P(M)}{P(\\text{equivocal})}$$\n\nThe numerator consists of two terms provided in the problem statement:\n- The probability of an equivocal result given a major injury, $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) = 0.20$.\n- The prior probability of a major injury, $P(M) = 0.004$.\n\nThe product of these terms gives the numerator:\n$$P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) P(M) = 0.20 \\times 0.004 = 0.0008$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(\\text{equivocal})$, is the total probability of obtaining an equivocal result. This can occur under two mutually exclusive conditions: either there is a major injury ($M$) and the result is equivocal, or there is no major injury ($\\neg M$) and the result is equivocal. We can calculate $P(\\text{equivocal})$ using the law of total probability:\n$$P(\\text{equivocal}) = P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid M) P(M) + P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid \\neg M) P(\\neg M)$$\n\nWe need to determine $P(\\neg M)$, the probability of no major bile duct injury. Since $M$ and $\\neg M$ are complementary events, their probabilities sum to $1$.\n$$P(\\neg M) = 1 - P(M) = 1 - 0.004 = 0.996$$\n\nNow we can calculate the denominator, using the given value $P(\\text{equivocal} \\mid \\neg M) = 0.10$:\n$$P(\\text{equivocal}) = (0.20 \\times 0.004) + (0.10 \\times 0.996)$$\n$$P(\\text{equivocal}) = 0.0008 + 0.0996$$\n$$P(\\text{equivocal}) = 0.1004$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values of the numerator and the denominator into Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal}) = \\frac{0.0008}{0.1004}$$\n$$P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal}) \\approx 0.00796812749$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $7$. The next three figures are $9$, $6$, and $8$. The fifth significant digit is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down by keeping the fourth significant digit as is.\n$$P(M \\mid \\text{equivocal}) \\approx 0.007968$$",
