We begin with the provided definition of the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$:\n$$K_{a}=\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}$$\nTo introduce $pK_{a}$ and $pH$, we take the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H}^{+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a/b) = \\log(a) - \\log(b)$, we can separate the terms on the right-hand side:\n$$\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) + \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) $$\nNow, we multiply the entire equation by $-1$:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) - \\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) $$\nBy definition, $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$. Substituting these definitions into the equation yields:\n$$pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right) + pH$$\nTo match the conventional form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, we rearrange the terms to solve for $pH$:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{BH}^{+}]}\\right)$$\nThis is the required relationship.\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the unionized fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{unionized}}$, in terms of $pH$ and $pK_{a}$.

            "introduction": "Our focus now shifts from local and regional techniques to the principles governing general anesthesia. Anesthetic depth during general anesthesia is quantified using the Minimum Alveolar Concentration ($MAC$), and modern practice often involves combining multiple agents for a balanced effect.

            "solution": "The problem consists of two tasks. The first is to justify the principle of additivity for fractional MACs. The second is to calculate the required concentration of sevoflurane.\n\n**Task 1: Justification of the Additivity of Fractional MACs**\n\nThe principle of additivity for inhaled anesthetics is justified by the following reasoning, derived from the problem's provided base facts:\n\n1.  **Potency and Effect Site:** MAC is defined as the median effective dose ($\\mathrm{ED}_{50}$) for the endpoint of immobility. The problem states that MAC is an equipotent reference concentration. The effect of an anesthetic is determined by its partial pressure at the effect site (the central nervous system). Under steady-state conditions, the end-tidal partial pressure is a reliable proxy for the effect-site partial pressure. Therefore, we can use end-tidal concentrations (expressed as percent by volume, which is proportional to partial pressure at constant total pressure) to quantify the dose.\n\n2.  **Normalized Dose (Fractional MAC):** For any given anesthetic, Agent $i$, with concentration $C_i$ and a specific MAC value, $\\mathrm{MAC}_i$, it is useful to define a normalized, dimensionless measure of its dose. This is the fractional MAC, given by $f_i = C_i / \\mathrm{MAC}_i$. When the concentration of the agent is equal to its MAC ($C_i = \\mathrm{MAC}_i$), the fractional MAC is $f_i = 1$, and this dose corresponds to a $50\\%$ probability of immobility.\n\n3.  **Dose-Response Relationship and Linear Approximation:** The problem states that the dose-response curve for immobility is a steep, monotone sigmoid, and importantly, that near the $50\\%$ response level (i.e., near $1.0$ MAC), \"the slope parameter [is] near $1$ ... permitting first-order approximations of combinations\". A first-order (linear) approximation is the foundation of the additivity principle. This implies that for small changes in dose around the MAC value, the change in effect is approximately proportional to the change in dose.\n\n4.  **Isoadditive Effect:** The problem states that the agents act through \"overlapping central nervous system pathways\" to produce a \"shared immobility endpoint\". In pharmacodynamics, when two drugs produce the same effect through similar mechanisms, their combined effect is often additive. This means that a fraction of a dose of one drug can be replaced by an equi-effective fraction of a dose of the other drug. The \"first-order approximation\" justifies treating this relationship as linear.\n\n5.  **Formalization:** Let the total effective dose, $D_{total}$, be a function of the concentrations of the two agents, sevoflurane ($C_S$) and nitrous oxide ($C_N$). Given the linear approximation and the concept of a shared mechanism, the simplest model for the combined dose is a linear sum of their normalized doses (fractional MACs). To achieve the same effect as $1.0$ MAC of a single agent (i.e., the $50\\%$ immobility point), the sum of the fractional MACs of the combined agents must equal $1$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{MAC}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{C_S}{\\mathrm{MAC}_S} + \\frac{C_N}{\\mathrm{MAC}_N} $$\n    For the specific target of $1.0$ MAC, we have:\n    $$ \\frac{C_S}{\\mathrm{MAC}_S} + \\frac{C_N}{\\mathrm{MAC}_N} = 1.0 $$\n    This equation describes a straight line on a graph of $C_S$ versus $C_N$, known as an isobole of additivity for the $\\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ effect. The justification, therefore, rests on the agents having a shared endpoint and mechanism, and a dose-response relationship that is approximately linear near the $\\mathrm{ED}_{50}$ point, allowing the total effect to be modeled as the sum of their fractional potencies.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of Sevoflurane Concentration**\n\nThe calculation proceeds in three steps: first, adjust the MAC values for the patient's age; second, apply the additivity principle; and third, solve for the unknown sevoflurane concentration.\n\n**Step a: Age Adjustment of MAC**\n\nThe patient's age is $a = 30$ years. The reference MAC values are given for age $40$. We use the provided formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{MAC}(a) = \\mathrm{MAC}_{40} \\times \\left[1 + 0.06 \\times \\frac{40 - a}{10}\\right] $$\nFor $a=30$:\n$$ \\mathrm{MAC}(30) = \\mathrm{MAC}_{40} \\times \\left[1 + 0.06 \\times \\frac{40 - 30}{10}\\right] = \\mathrm{MAC}_{40} \\times \\left[1 + 0.06 \\times \\frac{10}{10}\\right] = \\mathrm{MAC}_{40} \\times (1.06) $$\n\nFor sevoflurane (S):\n$$ \\mathrm{MAC}_{S,30} = \\mathrm{MAC}_{S,40} \\times 1.06 = 2.00\\% \\times 1.06 = 2.12\\% $$\n\nFor nitrous oxide (N):\n$$ \\mathrm{MAC}_{N,30} = \\mathrm{MAC}_{N,40} \\times 1.06 = 104\\% \\times 1.06 = 110.24\\% $$\n\n**Step b: Apply the Additivity Principle**\n\nThe goal is to achieve a total anesthetic level of $\\mathrm{MAC}_{\\text{total}} = 1.0$. Using the additivity principle justified in Task 1, we write:\n$$ \\mathrm{MAC}_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{C_N}{\\mathrm{MAC}_{N,30}} + \\frac{C_S}{\\mathrm{MAC}_{S,30}} $$\nwhere $C_N$ and $C_S$ are the end-tidal concentrations of nitrous oxide and sevoflurane, respectively.\n\n**Step c: Solve for Sevoflurane Concentration ($C_S$)**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\mathrm{MAC}_{\\text{total}} = 1.0$\n- $C_N = 60\\%$\n- $\\mathrm{MAC}_{N,30} = 110.24\\%$\n- $\\mathrm{MAC}_{S,30} = 2.12\\%$\n\nSubstitute these values into the additivity equation:\n$$ 1.0 = \\frac{60}{110.24} + \\frac{C_S}{2.12} $$\n\nNow, we solve for $C_S$. First, isolate the term containing $C_S$:\n$$ \\frac{C_S}{2.12} = 1.0 - \\frac{60}{110.24} $$\n\nNow, multiply by $2.12$ to solve for $C_S$:\n$$ C_S = 2.12 \\times \\left(1.0 - \\frac{60}{110.24}\\right) $$\n\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$ \\frac{60}{110.24} \\approx 0.544267... $$\n$$ C_S \\approx 2.12 \\times (1.0 - 0.544267...) $$\n$$ C_S \\approx 2.12 \\times (0.455732...) $$\n$$ C_S \\approx 0.96615... $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.\n$$ C_S \\approx 0.966 $$\nThe required end-tidal sevoflurane concentration is $0.966\\%$ by volume.",
