            "introduction": "Effective postoperative pain management is crucial for patient recovery and mobility. A key skill in this process is the ability to safely transition patients from intravenous (IV) to oral analgesics, a common step in preparing for discharge. This exercise  challenges you to apply the principle of equianalgesia to convert an IV morphine dose to an equivalent oral oxycodone dose, a fundamental calculation that ensures continuous and adequate pain control.",

            "problem": "A postoperative day $1$ patient following elective laparoscopic colectomy has received a total of $12$ milligrams (mg) of intravenous (IV) morphine over the past $24$ hours with adequate analgesia. You plan to transition the patient to oral oxycodone for discharge planning. Use the following well-established equianalgesic potency ratios: IV morphine to oral morphine potency $1:3$, and oral oxycodone to oral morphine potency $1.5:1$. Assume linear dose–response within the clinical range, no cross-tolerance reduction is applied, and no organ dysfunction alters pharmacokinetics. Compute the total $24$-hour oral oxycodone dose that is equianalgesic to the inpatient $24$-hour IV morphine dose. Report the exact value and express the final dose in milligrams (mg).",
            "solution": "The goal is to compute an equianalgesic oral oxycodone dose to match the observed analgesic effect from a known intravenous (IV) morphine dose over $24$ hours. The foundational base is the definition of equianalgesia: for two opioids, doses that produce the same analgesic effect satisfy a proportionality between dose and per-milligram analgesic potency. Let the analgesic effect be represented as an arbitrary effect unit $E$, and let the per-milligram potency of a drug relative to a reference be $p$. Then for a dose $d$, the effect is modeled as $E = d \\times p$ within the linear therapeutic range.\n\nWe adopt oral morphine as the reference with unit potency $p_{\\text{M,oral}} = 1$. The provided potency ratios are interpreted as follows:\n- IV morphine to oral morphine potency $1:3$ means $1$ mg IV morphine is equianalgesic to $3$ mg oral morphine; thus the per-milligram potency of IV morphine relative to oral morphine is $p_{\\text{M,IV}} = 3$.\n- Oral oxycodone to oral morphine potency $1.5:1$ means $1$ mg oral oxycodone is equianalgesic to $1.5$ mg oral morphine; thus the per-milligram potency of oral oxycodone relative to oral morphine is $p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 1.5$.\n\nLet $d_{\\text{M,IV}}$ be the administered $24$-hour IV morphine dose and $d_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}$ be the unknown equianalgesic $24$-hour oral oxycodone dose. Equianalgesia requires\n$$\nd_{\\text{M,IV}} \\times p_{\\text{M,IV}} = d_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} \\times p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}.\n$$\nSolving for the unknown,\n$$\nd_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = d_{\\text{M,IV}} \\times \\frac{p_{\\text{M,IV}}}{p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}}}.\n$$\nSubstitute the known values $d_{\\text{M,IV}} = 12$, $p_{\\text{M,IV}} = 3$, and $p_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 1.5$:\n$$\nd_{\\text{Oxy,oral}} = 12 \\times \\frac{3}{1.5} = 12 \\times 2 = 24.\n$$\nThus, the equianalgesic total $24$-hour oral oxycodone dose is $24$ mg. The problem requests the exact value and units in mg; no rounding is required.",

            "introduction": "Beyond pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a frequent and distressing complication that can delay recovery. Modern postoperative care emphasizes proactive risk assessment rather than reactive treatment. This practice  will guide you through the application of the Apfel simplified risk score, a validated tool used to quantify a patient's risk for PONV and inform decisions about prophylactic antiemetic therapy.",

            "problem": "A patient scheduled for laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a female who does not smoke, has a prior history of motion sickness, and will receive postoperative opioids for analgesia. Using the Apfel simplified risk model for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), define the number of present Apfel risk factors as $k$, where the four binary predictors are female sex, non-smoking status, prior history of PONV or motion sickness, and planned postoperative opioid use. Assume the predicted probability of PONV, denoted $p(k)$, is described by a logistic model consistent with widely accepted calibration for this score, namely\n$$p(k) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\!\\big(-(a + b k)\\big)},$$\nwith parameters $a$ and $b$ chosen so that $p(0) = 0.10$ and $p(4) = 0.79$. Starting from the fundamental definition of the log-odds and the logistic function, compute the Apfel score $k$ for this patient and the corresponding estimated PONV probability $p(k)$. Express $p(k)$ as a decimal (do not use a percent sign) and round it to $4$ significant figures. Report your final values as a two-entry row in the order $\\big(k,\\; p(k)\\big)$.",
            "solution": "The solution consists of three parts: first, determining the patient's Apfel score $k$; second, confirming the structure of the logistic model; and third, calculating the predicted probability of PONV for this patient.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of the Apfel Score $k$**\n\nThe Apfel simplified risk score, $k$, is the total count of four independent binary risk factors. We assess the patient's status for each factor based on the problem statement:\n1.  **Female sex**: The patient is female. This factor is present. ($1$ point)\n2.  **Non-smoking status**: The patient does not smoke. This factor is present. ($1$ point)\n3.  **Prior history of PONV or motion sickness**: The patient has a prior history of motion sickness. This factor is present. ($1$ point)\n4.  **Planned postoperative opioid use**: The patient will receive postoperative opioids. This factor is present. ($1$ point)\n\nThe total score $k$ is the sum of the points for the present factors:\n$$k = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$$\nThe Apfel score for this patient is $k=4$.\n\n**Part 2: Characterization of the Logistic Model**\n\nThe problem specifies a logistic model for the probability of PONV, $p(k)$, and provides two calibration points: $p(0) = 0.10$ and $p(4) = 0.79$. The model relates the score $k$ to the probability $p(k)$ via the log-odds (logit) transformation, creating a linear relationship:\n$$\\text{logit}(p(k)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p(k)}{1-p(k)}\\right) = a + bk$$\nThis structure allows us to determine the model parameters $a$ and $b$ from the given calibration points, confirming the model's internal consistency as requested by the prompt.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of the Estimated PONV Probability $p(k)$**\n\nWe need to compute the probability $p(k)$ for the patient, for whom we determined $k=4$. The problem statement directly provides the probability for a score of $k=4$ as one of the calibration points:\n$$p(4) = 0.79$$\nThe problem requires the final probability to be expressed with four significant figures. To do so, we append trailing zeros:\n$$p(4) = 0.7900$$\nThe final values to be reported are the score $k=4$ and the probability $p(k)=0.7900$.",

            "introduction": "Postoperative delirium is a serious neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with increased morbidity and mortality, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) is a standard screening tool, but its utility depends on a correct interpretation of its results. This problem  provides a hands-on opportunity to apply fundamental principles of diagnostic testing, calculating how a test's sensitivity and specificity translate into its predictive value within a specific clinical population.",

As requested, we use Bayes' theorem for the derivation:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting this gives the general formula in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{\\text{sens} \\cdot p}{\\text{sens} \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{spec}) \\cdot (1 - p)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.80)(0.20)}{(0.80)(0.20) + (0.10)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.16}{0.16 + 0.08} = \\frac{0.16}{0.24} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.6667\n$$\n\n**Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient does not have delirium given a negative test result, $P(D^c | T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe total probability of a negative test, $P(T^-)$, is:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)\n$$\nThis gives the general formula:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{\\text{spec} \\cdot (1 - p)}{\\text{spec} \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - \\text{sens}) \\cdot p}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.80)}{(0.90)(0.80) + (0.20)(0.20)} = \\frac{0.72}{0.72 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.72}{0.76} = \\frac{18}{19} \\approx 0.9474\n$$\nRounding both values to four significant figures, the positive predictive value is $0.6667$ and the negative predictive value is $0.9474$.",
