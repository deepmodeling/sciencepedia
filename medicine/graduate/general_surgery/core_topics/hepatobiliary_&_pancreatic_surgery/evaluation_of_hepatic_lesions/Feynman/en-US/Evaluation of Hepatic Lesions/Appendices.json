Modern imaging techniques, particularly Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), allow us to probe the biophysical properties of tissue, offering clues that go beyond simple anatomy. This practice  provides a hands-on opportunity to work with the principles of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI), a sequence that measures the random motion of water molecules. By calculating the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient ($ADC$) from raw signal data, you will quantify a key biomarker that reflects tissue cellularity and helps differentiate between benign and malignant lesions.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard biophysical modeling problem in medical imaging with realistic clinical context and data. All necessary information is provided, and the tasks are clearly defined and solvable.\n\nThe problem is based on the monoexponential model for signal attenuation in Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI), which is given as:\n$$S(b) = S_{0}\\exp(-b \\cdot ADC)$$\nwhere $S(b)$ is the measured signal intensity at a given diffusion weighting $b$-value, $S_0$ is the theoretical signal intensity at a $b$-value of $0\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$, and $ADC$ is the Apparent Diffusion Coefficient. The $ADC$ quantifies the magnitude of water molecule diffusion within a tissue voxel.\n\nWe are given two data points, ($b_1, S_1$) and ($b_2, S_2$), where $S_1 = S(b_1)$ and $S_2 = S(b_2)$. We can write the model equation for each point:\n$$S_1 = S_{0}\\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC)$$\n$$S_2 = S_{0}\\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC)$$\nTo derive an expression for the $ADC$, we must first eliminate the unknown variable $S_0$. This is accomplished by taking the ratio of the two equations:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{S_{0}\\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC)}{S_{0}\\exp(-b_1 \\cdot ADC)}$$\nThe $S_0$ terms cancel, and using the property of exponents $\\exp(x)/\\exp(y) = \\exp(x-y)$, we get:\n$$\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\exp(-b_2 \\cdot ADC - (-b_1 \\cdot ADC)) = \\exp(-(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC)$$\nTo solve for $ADC$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides, which is the inverse operation of the exponential function:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_2}{S_1}\\right) = -(b_2 - b_1) \\cdot ADC$$\nFinally, we isolate $ADC$ by dividing by $-(b_2 - b_1)$:\n$$ADC = -\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_2}{S_1}\\right)}{b_2 - b_1}$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $-\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(y/x)$, we can write the expression in a more convenient form that avoids a leading negative sign:\n$$ADC = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_1}{S_2}\\right)}{b_2 - b_1}$$\nThis is the general expression for $ADC$ derived from two signal measurements.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The problem provides:\n- $b_1 = 50\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$ with signal $S_1 = 980$.\n- $b_2 = 800\\,\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$ with signal $S_2 = 500$.\n\nThe units for the signals are arbitrary but consistent, so they cancel in the ratio. The units for the $b$-values are $\\mathrm{s/mm^2}$, so the resulting units for $ADC$ will be $\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n$$ADC = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{980}{500}\\right)}{800 - 50} = \\frac{\\ln(1.96)}{750}\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\\ln(1.96) \\approx 0.672944$$\n$$ADC \\approx \\frac{0.672944}{750}\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}} \\approx 0.000897259\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ADC \\approx 0.000897\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{mm^2}{s}}$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $8.97 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n\nFinally, we must comment on the clinical significance of this value. The computed $ADC$ is $0.897 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$. In the context of solid hepatic lesions:\n- **Malignant metastases**, particularly from adenocarcinomas, are typically highly cellular tumors. This high cellularity, with large nuclei and scant cytoplasm, restricts the random motion (diffusion) of water molecules. This restriction results in a low $ADC$ value, generally considered to be less than $1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n- **Benign hemangiomas** are composed of large, blood-filled vascular spaces with very slow-moving blood. This environment allows for relatively unrestricted diffusion of water molecules, resulting in a high $ADC$ value, typically much greater than $2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$.\n\nThe calculated $ADC$ of $0.897 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mm^2/s}$ is a low value. Therefore, this magnitude is highly compatible with a malignant metastasis and not compatible with a benign hemangioma. This finding is concordant with the patient's known history of colorectal adenocarcinoma, for which the liver is a common site of metastasis.",

The scenario is a standard application of Bayesian inference for clinical diagnosis, a core concept in medical decision-making and biostatistics. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the posttest probability of a lesion being hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) given a set of MRI findings. This is achieved using the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem. The process involves four steps:\n1.  Determine the pretest probability of HCC based on the provided cohort data and convert it to pretest odds.\n2.  Calculate the combined likelihood ratio ($LR$) for all MRI findings, assuming conditional independence.\n3.  Calculate the posttest odds by multiplying the pretest odds and the combined $LR$.\n4.

The problem provides data from a surveillance cohort of $N=500$ patients with HCV cirrhosis and newly detected $2.0$–$3.0 \\ \\text{cm}$ nodules, where $k=230$ nodules were confirmed as HCC.

For a present finding, we use the positive likelihood ratio ($LR_+$), and for an absent finding, we use the negative likelihood ratio ($LR_-$).\n-   For $E_1$ (APHE present), the relevant likelihood ratio is $LR_+(E_1) = 4.8$.\n-   For $E_2$ (WO present), the relevant likelihood ratio is $LR_+(E_2) = 6.3$.\n-   For $E_3$ (EC absent), the relevant likelihood ratio is $LR_-(E_3) = 0.75$.\n-   For $E_4$ (TG absent), the relevant likelihood ratio is $LR_-(E_4) = 0.85$.\n\nThe problem states to assume conditional independence of these features. This assumption allows us to calculate the combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{comb}}$, for the set of all four findings by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$LR_{\\text{comb}} = LR_+(E_1) \\times LR_+(E_2) \\times LR_-(E_3) \\times LR_-(E_4)$$\n$$LR_{\\text{comb}} = 4.8 \\times 6.3 \\times 0.75 \\times 0.85$$\n$$LR_{\\text{comb}} = 30.24 \\times 0.6375$$\n$$LR_{\\text{comb}} = 19.278$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Posttest Odds.\nThe posttest odds are found by multiplying the pretest odds by the combined likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times LR_{\\text{comb}}$$\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left(\\frac{0.46}{0.54}\\right) \\times 19.278$$\nKeeping the fraction for precision during intermediate steps:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.85185185... \\times 19.278 \\approx 16.421555...$$\n\nStep 4: Convert Posttest Odds to Posttest Probability.\nThe posttest probability, $P(D|E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4)$, is calculated from the posttest odds using the formula:\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{16.421555...}{1 + 16.421555...} = \\frac{16.421555...}{17.421555...}$$\n$$P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.9426004...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$P_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.9426$$\n\nThus, the posttest probability that the lesion is HCC after incorporating all four MRI features is approximately $0.9426$.",

Let us denote the Total Liver Volume as $V_{\\text{TLV}}$, the Tumor Volume as $V_{\\text{tumor}}$, and the Future Liver Remnant volume as $V_{\\text{FLR}}$.\n\nAccording to the problem's definitions:\n1.
