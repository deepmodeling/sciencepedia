You will apply a formal risk-benefit analysis, integrating imaging characteristics with the distinct biological risks of hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), and hepatocellular adenoma.

            "problem": "A clinician is deciding whether to perform a percutaneous core needle biopsy on a hypervascular liver lesion in a patient being evaluated for a benign tumor. The lesion is suspected to be one of hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), or hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). The decision is to be justified by first-principles reasoning: compare the expected diagnostic benefit of biopsy against its expected harm, using the following fundamental bases rooted in surgical practice and clinical epidemiology.\n\nBase facts and definitions:\n- A hemangioma is a benign vascular malformation composed of blood-filled channels; its histology implies a higher bleeding risk with needle puncture compared with solid benign hepatocellular lesions.\n- Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) is a benign hyperplastic lesion with a central scar; it consists of normal hepatocytes with ductular reaction and abnormal vasculature, typically managed conservatively when confidently diagnosed.\n- Hepatocellular adenoma (HCA) is a benign hepatocellular tumor associated with estrogen exposure; it carries risks of hemorrhage and rare malignant transformation, and is often resected when size is large (for example, larger than $5\\,\\text{cm}$), in males, or when symptomatic.\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide characteristic features for these lesions. When classic features are present, noninvasive diagnosis can approach near certainty, reducing the incremental value of biopsy.\n- Percutaneous liver biopsy carries a nonzero risk of hemorrhage that is higher in hemangioma due to its vascular structure. Tumor seeding risk is a significant concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but is negligible for benign lesions such as FNH and HCA.\n- Decision-making can be framed by Bayesian updating of diagnostic probabilities from imaging and by a risk-benefit calculus in which expected harm is the probability of a complication multiplied by its disutility and expected benefit is the probability that biopsy changes management multiplied by the utility of that change.\n\nAssume the following empirically plausible test characteristics for MRI patterns (each evaluated against “not the target diagnosis” as the comparator class):\n- For the “classic hemangioma pattern” (peripheral nodular discontinuous enhancement with progressive centripetal fill-in and marked $T2$ hyperintensity): sensitivity $Se_H = 0.95$ and specificity $Sp_H = 0.98$.\n- For the “FNH pattern” using hepatobiliary agent uptake (iso- to hyperintensity on hepatobiliary phase, often with a central scar): sensitivity $Se_F = 0.90$ and specificity $Sp_F = 0.95$.\n- For the “adenoma pattern” (arterial phase hyperenhancement without hepatobiliary uptake, frequent intracellular fat with signal drop on opposed-phase, and lack of a central scar): sensitivity $Se_A = 0.85$ and specificity $Sp_A = 0.90$.\n\nAssume representative pretest probabilities in women aged $20$–$40$ years with an incidentally discovered solitary hypervascular lesion: $p(H) = 0.40$, $p(F) = 0.35$, and $p(A) = 0.25$, where $H$ denotes hemangioma, $F$ denotes FNH, and $A$ denotes HCA. For percutaneous biopsy, assume the probability of a major hemorrhage conditional on the true diagnosis is $p(\\text{bleed}\\mid H) = 0.020$, $p(\\text{bleed}\\mid F) = 0.006$, and $p(\\text{bleed}\\mid A) = 0.010$. Let the qualitative utility of a biopsy that correctly changes management be $U_{\\text{diagnostic}} > 0$, and the disutility of a major bleed be $C_{\\text{bleed}} > 0$.\n\nConsider the following scenarios and select the option(s) that correctly justify whether percutaneous biopsy is appropriate or contraindicated:\n\nA. A $45$-year-old woman has a $3.5\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion with classic hemangioma MRI features. Her pretest probability of hemangioma is $p(H) = 0.50$ (other causes collectively $p(\\neg H) = 0.50$). The clinician is considering biopsy to “be sure.” The question is whether biopsy is justified given the expected diagnostic gain relative to the expected harm from hemorrhage based on the lesion’s vascular nature.\n\nB. A $28$-year-old woman has a $6.0\\,\\text{cm}$ hypervascular lesion with arterial hyperenhancement but without hepatobiliary uptake; however, the MRI lacks definitive features to distinguish between FNH and HCA. Pretest probabilities are $p(F) = 0.50$ and $p(A) = 0.50$. Because management diverges substantially (conservative for FNH versus consideration of resection for HCA at $>5\\,\\text{cm}$), the clinician considers biopsy to guide management, having corrected the International Normalized Ratio (INR) to $<1.5$, stopped aspirin for $7$ days, and planned a coaxial technique to minimize passes.\n\nC. A $35$-year-old woman has a $3.0\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion with FNH-characteristic uptake on hepatobiliary phase MRI and a visible central scar; pretest $p(F) = 0.40$ (others $0.60$). She is asymptomatic. The clinician debates biopsy versus observation.\n\nD. A $32$-year-old man has a $4.0\\,\\text{cm}$ hypervascular lesion suspected to be HCA. The team states that biopsy is contraindicated due to “tumor seeding risk inherent to all hypervascular lesions,” and therefore should be avoided even if imaging remains indeterminate.\n\nWhich options correctly justify when percutaneous biopsy is appropriate or contraindicated in these scenarios?\n\nOptions:\nA. Contraindicated: classic hemangioma features on MRI yield near-certainty; expected harm from hemorrhage outweighs negligible diagnostic gain.\n\nB. Appropriate: indeterminate imaging between FNH and HCA at $6.0\\,\\text{cm}$ where diagnosis will change management; with bleeding risk mitigated, expected benefit exceeds expected harm.\n\nC. Contraindicated: FNH diagnosis is near-certain on hepatobiliary MRI; biopsy offers minimal incremental value and carries nonzero bleeding risk.\n\nD. Appropriate: biopsy should be avoided for suspected HCA because tumor seeding risk is intrinsic to all hypervascular lesions, including benign tumors, making biopsy broadly contraindicated.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically grounded in the principles of medical decision-making, and well-posed. All the necessary data and definitions are provided to analyze the scenarios. The problem is valid.\n\nThe analysis of each scenario and its corresponding option is as follows:\n\n**Analysis of Scenario A and Option A**\n\nThe scenario describes a $45$-year-old woman with a $3.5\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion showing \"classic hemangioma MRI features.\" The pretest probability of hemangioma is given as $p(H) = 0.50$. The provided MRI test characteristics for a classic hemangioma pattern are sensitivity $Se_H = 0.95$ and specificity $Sp_H = 0.98$. A positive test result ($T^+$) corresponds to observing these classic features. We can calculate the post-test probability of hemangioma using Bayes' theorem:\n\n$p(H \\mid T^+) = \\frac{p(T^+ \\mid H) \\cdot p(H)}{p(T^+ \\mid H) \\cdot p(H) + p(T^+ \\mid \\neg H) \\cdot p(\\neg H)}$\n\nHere, $p(T^+ \\mid H) = Se_H = 0.95$, and $p(T^+ \\mid \\neg H) = 1 - Sp_H = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$. The pretest probabilities are $p(H) = 0.50$ and $p(\\neg H) = 0.50$.\n\n$$ p(H \\mid T^+) = \\frac{(0.95)(0.50)}{(0.95)(0.50) + (0.02)(0.50)} = \\frac{0.475}{0.475 + 0.01} = \\frac{0.475}{0.485} \\approx 0.9794 $$\n\nThe post-test probability of the lesion being a hemangioma is approximately $98\\%$, which is considered near-certainty in a clinical context. The management for a $3.5\\,\\text{cm}$ asymptomatic hemangioma is conservative observation. The probability that the lesion is not a hemangioma is $p(\\neg H \\mid T^+) \\approx 1 - 0.9794 = 0.0206$, or about $2\\%$. Even in this small chance, a small ($<5\\,\\text{cm}$) FNH or HCA would also typically be managed with observation. Thus, the probability that a biopsy will change management is negligible.\n\nThe expected benefit of a biopsy, which is proportional to the probability of changing management, is therefore extremely small.\n\nThe expected harm is related to the probability of a major hemorrhage from the biopsy, $p(\\text{bleed})$. This is dominated by the high probability that the lesion is a hemangioma, which has the highest conditional bleeding risk:\n$p(\\text{bleed}) = p(\\text{bleed} \\mid H)p(H \\mid T^+) + \\dots \\approx p(\\text{bleed} \\mid H)p(H \\mid T^+) = (0.020)(0.9794) \\approx 0.0196$.\nThe expected harm is $p(\\text{bleed}) \\times C_{\\text{bleed}} \\approx 0.0196 \\cdot C_{\\text{bleed}}$, which is a non-negligible risk of a serious complication.\n\nComparing the two, the negligible expected benefit of biopsy is outweighed by the expected harm. Therefore, biopsy is contraindicated.\n\nOption A states: \"Contraindicated: classic hemangioma features on MRI yield near-certainty; expected harm from hemorrhage outweighs negligible diagnostic gain.\" This aligns perfectly with the analysis.\n\nVerdict for Option A: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario B and Option B**\n\nThis scenario involves a $28$-year-old woman with a $6.0\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion, where MRI is indeterminate between FNH and HCA. The pretest probabilities are $p(F) = 0.50$ and $p(A) = 0.50$. The management for these two conditions diverges significantly. An FNH is managed conservatively. An HCA of this size ($> 5\\,\\text{cm}$) is typically recommended for resection due to increased risks of hemorrhage and malignant transformation.\n\nThe decision to resect versus observe hinges directly on the definitive diagnosis. Therefore, a biopsy that can distinguish FNH from HCA has a very high diagnostic utility. The probability that the biopsy will change management is high; it is essentially the probability of clarifying the diagnosis, which in a $50/50$ scenario, is almost certain to dictate the final plan. So, the expected benefit, $p(\\text{change management}) \\cdot U_{\\text{diagnostic}}$, is substantial.\n\nThe expected harm is the probability of a major bleed, $p(\\text{bleed})$, multiplied by its disutility $C_{\\text{bleed}}$. We calculate the overall probability of a bleed based on the pretest probabilities:\n$$ p(\\text{bleed}) = p(\\text{bleed} \\mid F)p(F) + p(\\text{bleed} \\mid A)p(A) $$\n$$ p(\\text{bleed}) = (0.006)(0.50) + (0.010)(0.50) = 0.003 + 0.005 = 0.008 $$\nThe overall risk of a major bleed is $0.8\\%$. The scenario also notes that bleeding risk is being actively mitigated (correcting coagulopathy, stopping antiplatelets, using a coaxial technique). This further reduces the expected harm.\n\nIn this case, the substantial expected benefit (clarifying a critical management decision between major surgery and observation) clearly outweighs the low ($0.8\\%$) and mitigated expected harm of the procedure. Biopsy is therefore appropriate.\n\nOption B states: \"Appropriate: indeterminate imaging between FNH and HCA at $6.0\\,\\text{cm}$ where diagnosis will change management; with bleeding risk mitigated, expected benefit exceeds expected harm.\" This reasoning is sound and matches the analysis.\n\nVerdict for Option B: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario C and Option C**\n\nThis scenario describes a $35$-year-old woman with a $3.0\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion showing characteristic features of FNH on MRI (\"FNH-characteristic uptake on hepatobiliary phase... and a visible central scar\"). The pretest probability is $p(F) = 0.40$. The MRI test characteristics for an FNH pattern are $Se_F = 0.90$ and $Sp_F = 0.95$. A positive test result ($T^+$) corresponds to observing these classic features. We calculate the post-test probability of FNH:\n\n$p(F \\mid T^+) = \\frac{p(T^+ \\mid F) \\cdot p(F)}{p(T^+ \\mid F) \\cdot p(F) + p(T^+ \\mid \\neg F) \\cdot p(\\neg F)}$\n\nHere, $p(T^+ \\mid F) = Se_F = 0.90$, and $p(T^+ \\mid \\neg F) = 1 - Sp_F = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$. The pretest probabilities are $p(F) = 0.40$ and $p(\\neg F) = 0.60$.\n\n$$ p(F \\mid T^+) = \\frac{(0.90)(0.40)}{(0.90)(0.40) + (0.05)(0.60)} = \\frac{0.36}{0.36 + 0.03} = \\frac{0.36}{0.39} \\approx 0.923 $$\n\nThe post-test probability of FNH is approximately $92\\%$, which is very high. The management for a $3.0\\,\\text{cm}$ asymptomatic FNH is observation. Given the high certainty of the diagnosis and the small size of the lesion, management is extremely unlikely to change with a biopsy result. The incremental diagnostic value is minimal.\n\nThe expected harm is the non-zero risk of a bleed from the biopsy. The approximate risk is:\n$p(\\text{bleed}) \\approx p(\\text{bleed} \\mid F)p(F \\mid T^+) = (0.006)(0.923) \\approx 0.0055$.\nSo the expected harm is approximately $0.0055 \\cdot C_{\\text{bleed}}$.\n\nAs in scenario A, the expected benefit is negligible, while the expected harm, though small, is non-zero. The risk-benefit analysis does not favor biopsy. Biopsy is contraindicated.\n\nOption C states: \"Contraindicated: FNH diagnosis is near-certain on hepatobiliary MRI; biopsy offers minimal incremental value and carries nonzero bleeding risk.\" This is a correct summary of the clinical reasoning.\n\nVerdict for Option C: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Scenario D and Option D**\n\nThe scenario concerns a $32$-year-old man with a $4.0\\,\\text{cm}$ lesion suspected to be HCA. The team's justification for contraindicating biopsy is the \"tumor seeding risk inherent to all hypervascular lesions.\"\n\nThis justification is factually incorrect, as stated directly in the problem's \"Base facts and definitions\": \"Tumor seeding risk is a significant concern for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) but is negligible for benign lesions such as FNH and HCA.\" The concern about seeding applies to malignancies, not benign tumors, regardless of their vascularity. An HCA is a benign tumor. Therefore, the team's reasoning is scientifically unsound.\n\nIn a male patient, an HCA of any size is often resected due to a higher risk of malignant transformation compared to HCAs in female patients. Confirming the diagnosis is therefore of high importance. If imaging is indeterminate, biopsy is a critical tool to differentiate HCA (which would prompt surgery) from FNH (which would be observed). Contraindicating biopsy based on a fallacious argument about seeding risk is incorrect clinical practice.\n\nOption D states: \"Appropriate: biopsy should be avoided for suspected HCA because tumor seeding risk is intrinsic to all hypervascular lesions, including benign tumors, making biopsy broadly contraindicated.\" This option presents a conclusion and a justification. The justification provided (\"tumor seeding risk is intrinsic to all hypervascular lesions, including benign tumors\") is a false statement. Because the reasoning is fundamentally flawed, the option cannot be a \"correct justification.\"\n\nVerdict for Option D: **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, Options A, B, and C provide correct justifications for the appropriateness or contraindication of biopsy in their respective scenarios. Option D provides an incorrect justification based on a scientifically false premise.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The provided clinical, radiological, histological, and immunohistochemical data represent a classic, albeit detailed, case that is fully formalizable within the current medical understanding of benign hepatocellular tumors. All required information for a definitive classification and management decision is present. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by systematic integration of the provided data based on fundamental principles of pathology and surgical oncology.\n\n1.  **Histological Diagnosis**: The biopsy finding of a \"hepatocellular proliferation with thickened plates... absence of portal tracts within the lesion\" is the defining histological feature of a hepatocellular adenoma (HCA). This finding rules out focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), which is characterized by a central fibrous scar with abnormal blood vessels and a ductular reaction, features that are explicitly absent here (\"no central scar\", \"no significant ductular reaction\", \"absence of portal tracts\").\n\n2.  **Molecular Subtyping via Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**: The classification of HCAs into subtypes with different biological behaviors and malignant potentials is based on their underlying molecular alterations, which can be identified using IHC.\n    *   **Ruling out HNF1A-inactivated HCA**: This subtype, caused by mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor $1\\alpha$ ($HNF1A$) gene, results in defective fatty acid metabolism. The pathognomonic IHC finding is the loss of liver fatty acid-binding protein (LFABP) expression within the tumor cells. The problem states that LFABP is **retained**, which definitively excludes this diagnosis.\n    *   **Ruling out Inflammatory HCA**: This subtype is driven by activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, leading to the overexpression of acute-phase reactants. The key IHC markers are C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA). The problem states that CRP and SAA are **negative**, which definitively excludes this diagnosis.\n    *   **Confirming Beta-catenin–activated HCA**: This subtype is caused by activating mutations in the `CTNNB1` gene, which encodes beta-catenin. These mutations prevent its degradation, leading to its accumulation and translocation into the nucleus. This nuclear localization of beta-catenin is a direct marker of pathway activation and is stated as present. A downstream target of activated beta-catenin is the gene `GLUL`, which encodes glutamine synthetase (GS). Consequently, beta-catenin–activated HCAs (b-HCAs) show strong and typically diffuse or \"mosaic (map-like)\" GS staining. Both \"nuclear localization of beta-catenin\" and \"strong glutamine synthetase (GS) staining in a mosaic (map-like) pattern\" are explicitly given.\n\n3.  **Final Diagnosis**: The combination of histological features of HCA with an IHC profile of retained LFABP, negative CRP/SAA, positive nuclear beta-catenin, and strong/mosaic GS staining is conclusive for a beta-catenin–activated hepatocellular adenoma (b-HCA).\n\n4.  **Surgical Implication**: The management of HCA is dictated by its subtype, size, and patient sex, based on the risks of hemorrhage and malignant transformation. The b-HCA subtype carries the highest risk of malignant transformation into hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with reported rates as high as 40-50% in some studies. This risk is considered substantial regardless of the lesion's size or the patient's sex. Due to this high malignant potential, the standard of care and consensus guideline recommendation is surgical resection for all diagnosed b-HCAs. The patient being male is an additional factor favoring resection, as HCAs in males have a higher propensity to be of the b-HCA subtype and to undergo malignant change. The lesion size of $3.5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ does not preclude the need for surgery in this specific subtype.\n\nBased on this derivation, the following option-by-option analysis is performed:\n\nA) Focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH); observation only with routine follow-up, no resection indicated.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The diagnosis is FNH, which is contradicted by the histological finding of absent portal tracts and the IHC finding of nuclear beta-catenin.\n\nB) Hepatocyte nuclear factor $1\\alpha$ (HNF1A)-inactivated hepatocellular adenoma; withdraw estrogen exposure and observe if the lesion remains $<5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The diagnosis of HNF1A-inactivated HCA is ruled out by the retained expression of LFABP. Furthermore, the patient is male with no stated estrogen exposure, making that part of the recommendation irrelevant.\n\nC) Beta-catenin–activated hepatocellular adenoma; surgical resection is recommended due to increased risk of malignant transformation, irrespective of size and sex.\nThis is **Correct**. The diagnosis is precisely supported by the complete set of IHC findings (nuclear beta-catenin, GS pattern, negative markers for other subtypes). The surgical implication is the current standard of care for this high-risk lesion due to its significant potential for malignant transformation.\n\nD) Inflammatory hepatocellular adenoma; medical anti-inflammatory management and resection only if $>5$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ or symptomatic.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The diagnosis of inflammatory HCA is ruled out by the negative CRP and SAA staining. \"Medical anti-inflammatory management\" is not a standard primary therapy for HCAs.\n\nE) Beta-catenin–activated focal nodular hyperplasia; resection only if symptomatic due to benign behavior.\nThis is **Incorrect**. The diagnosis \"beta-catenin–activated focal nodular hyperplasia\" is a nosological contradiction; these are distinct entities in the current classification. The histological findings also rule out FNH. The assertion of \"benign behavior\" directly contradicts the known high malignant potential of beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular neoplasms.",

The concepts of liver segmentation (Couinaud segments), total liver volume, future liver remnant volume, and the FLR fraction are fundamental in assessing the risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). The given volumes are anatomically and physiologically realistic for an adult.

It provides all necessary numerical data ($V_{\\text{total}}$ and $V_{\\text{FLR}}$), a clear definition for the quantity to be calculated ($f_{\\text{FLR}}$), and a specific criterion for evaluation (the $0.20$ threshold). A unique, stable, and meaningful solution can be determined.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using objective, standard medical and mathematical terminology. It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Solution**\nThe primary task is to compute the Future Liver Remnant (FLR) fraction, denoted as $f_{\\text{FLR}}$, and then to compare this value against a given clinical threshold.\n\nThe problem defines the FLR fraction as the ratio of the remnant liver volume to the total liver volume. Let $V_{\\text{FLR}}$ represent the future liver remnant volume and $V_{\\text{total}}$ represent the total liver volume. The formula for the FLR fraction is:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{FLR}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$$\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $V_{\\text{FLR}} = 450 \\, \\text{mL}$\n-   $V_{\\text{total}} = 1500 \\, \\text{mL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = \\frac{450}{1500}$$\n\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. We can start by dividing by $10$:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = \\frac{45}{150}$$\nNow, we can divide by $15$:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = \\frac{45 \\div 15}{150 \\div 15} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = 0.3$$\n\nThe problem requires this result to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $0.3$ has only one significant figure. To express it with three significant figures, we must add trailing zeros after the decimal point:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} = 0.300$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine if the planned resection is volumetrically adequate. The threshold for adequacy in a patient with a normal, non-fibrotic liver is given as an FLR fraction greater than or equal to $0.20$.\nWe must compare the calculated FLR fraction with this threshold:\n$$f_{\\text{FLR}} \\ge 0.20$$\n$$0.300 \\ge 0.20$$\n\nThis inequality is true. Since the calculated FLR fraction of $0.300$ exceeds the minimum required threshold of $0.20$, the planned extended right hepatectomy is considered volumetrically adequate for this patient, implying a lower risk of post-hepatectomy liver failure. The final numerical answer requested is the FLR fraction expressed as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.",
