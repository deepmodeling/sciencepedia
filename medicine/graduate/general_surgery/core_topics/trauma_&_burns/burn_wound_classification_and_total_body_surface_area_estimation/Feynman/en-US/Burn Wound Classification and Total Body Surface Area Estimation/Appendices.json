            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of clinical medicine, specifically the methods for estimating the extent of burn injuries. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. It requests a calculation based on foundational knowledge in the field, which is a standard academic and clinical task.\n\nThe estimation of the total body surface area (TBSA) affected by a burn is a critical step in managing burn patients, as it guides fluid resuscitation and treatment decisions. For an adult patient with a normal body habitus, the most common and foundational method for rapid estimation is the \"Wallace Rule of Nines.\" This rule is the basis for the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is the applicability of the Rule of Nines, which partitions the adult body surface into regions that are multiples of $9\\%$. The anatomical partitioning under this rule is as follows:\n- The head and neck comprise $9\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The anterior trunk (chest and abdomen) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The posterior trunk (upper and lower back) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- Each entire upper limb (arm, forearm, and hand) comprises $9\\%$ of TBSA.\n- Each entire lower limb (thigh, leg, and foot) comprises $18\\%$ of TBSA.\n- The perineum comprises the remaining $1\\%$ of TBSA.\nThe sum of these areas is $9\\% + 18\\% + 18\\% + 2 \\times 9\\% + 2 \\times 18\\% + 1\\% = 100\\%$. The problem specifies that the burns are of at least partial thickness, which is the standard threshold for inclusion in TBSA calculations for clinical management.\n\nWe will now calculate the TBSA involved based on the anatomical locations provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Anterior Trunk:** The problem states the burn involves the \"entire anterior trunk.\" According to the Rule of Nines, the TBSA for the entire anterior trunk is $18\\%$.\n    Let $A_{\\text{trunk}}$ be the surface area of the anterior trunk.\n    $$A_{\\text{trunk}} = 0.18$$\n\n2.  **Anterior Surfaces of Both Upper Limbs:** The problem states the burn involves the \"anterior surfaces of both upper limbs.\"\n    According to the Rule of Nines, one entire upper limb accounts for $9\\%$ of TBSA. The anterior surface is anatomically defined as half of the total surface area of the limb.\n    Let $A_{\\text{limb, single}}$ be the surface area of the anterior surface of a single upper limb.\n    $$A_{\\text{limb, single}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 9\\% = 4.5\\%$$\n    Since the burns involve both upper limbs, the total contribution from the limbs, $A_{\\text{limbs}}$, is twice this value.\n    $$A_{\\text{limbs}} = 2 \\times A_{\\text{limb, single}} = 2 \\times 4.5\\% = 9\\%$$\n    As a decimal fraction, this is:\n    $$A_{\\text{limbs}} = 0.09$$\n\nThe total body surface area, $TBSA_{\\text{total}}$, involved is the sum of the TBSA from the anterior trunk and the anterior surfaces of both upper limbs.\n$$TBSA_{\\text{total}} = A_{\\text{trunk}} + A_{\\text{limbs}}$$\n$$TBSA_{\\text{total}} = 18\\% + 9\\% = 27\\%$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be expressed as a decimal fraction of total body surface area, rounded to three significant figures.\n$$TBSA_{\\text{total}} = 0.27$$\nTo express $0.27$ with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero.\n$$TBSA_{\\text{total}} \\approx 0.270$$\nThis final value represents the estimated fraction of the patient's total body surface area that has sustained at least a partial-thickness burn.",

            "problem": "A $35$-year-old man presents with an irregular thermal burn that wraps over the left shoulder, spanning the anterior chest, lateral shoulder, and proximal left upper arm. High-resolution photographs with standardized scaling are traced onto an age-appropriate segmentation template. The tracing is then planimetrically partitioned by anatomical boundaries so that each portion lies within a single body segment. The following fractional coverages are obtained relative to each segment’s total surface area: anterior trunk covered $25\\%$, posterior trunk covered $5\\%$, and left upper limb covered $40\\%$. Within the traced shoulder–arm burn polygon, $30\\%$ of the area is full thickness and $70\\%$ is deep partial thickness. Separately, there is a superficial erythematous burn of the right thigh estimated at $2\\%$ of total body surface area.\n\nYou are asked to select the approach that correctly explains how to avoid double counting when burns span regional boundaries and specifies scientifically sound rules for boundary allocation. The approach must also yield the correct numerical estimates for total body surface area (TBSA) burned and full-thickness TBSA in this patient. Consider the following established facts as the fundamental base for clinical estimation in an adult: the Rule of Nines assigns the anterior trunk $18\\%$, the posterior trunk $18\\%$, and each entire upper limb $9\\%$ of TBSA. When partitioning, anatomical boundaries are defined by midlines (for example, mid-axillary line separating anterior and posterior trunk) and joint-based transitions (for example, the glenohumeral region delineating trunk from upper limb). Superficial erythema without blistering is not included in resuscitation-relevant burned TBSA.\n\nWhich option best satisfies the above, both in method and result?\n\nA. Trace the burn once on an age-appropriate chart and partition strictly along anatomical segment boundaries (for example, mid-axillary line for anterior versus posterior trunk; acromial/glenohumeral transition for trunk versus arm) so that no area lies in two segments. Allocate fractional coverage to each segment and sum disjoint contributions: anterior trunk $25\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $4.5\\%$, posterior trunk $5\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $0.9\\%$, and left arm $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ gives $3.6\\%$, totaling $9.0\\%$ TBSA burned. Treat depth categories as nested subsets: full-thickness TBSA is $30\\%$ of the traced polygon, i.e., $0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\%$. Exclude the $2\\%$ superficial thigh erythema from burned TBSA.\n\nB. Sum coverage across all segments as in the tracing, then increase the total by the fraction that is full thickness to reflect severity. Include the superficial thigh since it is skin injury. Report $4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.0\\%$, then add $2.7\\%$ again for full thickness and $2.0\\%$ for the thigh, for a final total of $13.7\\%$.\n\nC. To avoid double counting at boundaries, assign the entire shoulder–arm polygon to the single segment with the largest share and ignore the smaller shares. Classify depth by multiplying this segment’s contribution by the full-thickness fraction. Report $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ as $3.6\\%$ TBSA burned and $0.30 \\times 3.6\\% = 1.08\\%$ full-thickness TBSA.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical problem requiring the calculation of Total Body Surface Area (TBSA) for a burn patient, along with the specification of the correct methodology for handling burns that cross anatomical boundaries.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Patient: A $35$-year-old man.\n-   Primary Burn Location: Irregular thermal burn over the left shoulder, spanning the anterior chest, lateral shoulder, and proximal left upper arm.\n-   Measurement Data (as fractions of specific body segments):\n    1.  Anterior trunk covered: $25\\%$\n    2.  Posterior trunk covered: $5\\%$\n    3.  Left upper limb covered: $40\\%$\n-   Burn Depth Distribution (for the primary burn):\n    1.  Full thickness: $30\\%$ of the total area of the primary burn.\n    2.  Deep partial thickness: $70\\%$ of the total area of the primary burn.\n-   Secondary Burn: A superficial erythematous burn of the right thigh, estimated at $2\\%$ of TBSA.\n-   Fundamental Principles for an Adult Patient:\n    1.  Rule of Nines allocations: Anterior trunk is $18\\%$ of TBSA, posterior trunk is $18\\%$ of TBSA, and each entire upper limb is $9\\%$ of TBSA.\n    2.  Boundary Partitioning Rule: Burns spanning regional boundaries are to be partitioned along defined anatomical lines (e.g., mid-axillary line, glenohumeral transition) so each sub-area belongs to a single segment.\n    3.  TBSA Inclusion Rule: Superficial erythema is not included in the calculation of resuscitation-relevant TBSA.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is well-grounded in the established medical principles of burn assessment. The Rule of Nines is a standard method for TBSA estimation in adults. The concept of partitioning a burn at anatomical boundaries to avoid double counting is fundamental to accurate chart-based methods (like the Lund-Browder chart, which the described planimetric method emulates). The classification of burn depths and the exclusion of first-degree (superficial) burns from fluid resuscitation calculations are standard clinical practice.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and clear, unambiguous rules to arrive at a single, correct set of numerical answers and a correct methodological description.\n-   **Objective**: The problem uses precise, quantitative language and relies on established objective standards in medicine. It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe task is to identify the option that correctly describes the methodology for handling a boundary-crossing burn and yields the correct TBSA and full-thickness TBSA values.\n\n**Principle 1: Calculation of Resuscitation-Relevant TBSA**\n\nThe core principle to avoid double counting for a burn that crosses anatomical regions is to partition the burn area along those boundaries. The total TBSA is the sum of the TBSA contributions from each disjoint partition.\n\n1.  **Contribution from the Anterior Trunk:**\n    The anterior trunk represents $18\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $25\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{ant trunk}} = 0.25 \\times 18\\% = 4.5\\% $$\n\n2.  **Contribution from the Posterior Trunk:**\n    The posterior trunk represents $18\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $5\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{post trunk}} = 0.05 \\times 18\\% = 0.9\\% $$\n\n3.  **Contribution from the Left Upper Limb:**\n    The entire left upper limb represents $9\\%$ of the total body surface area. The burn covers $40\\%$ of this region.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{left arm}} = 0.40 \\times 9\\% = 3.6\\% $$\n\n4.  **Total TBSA of the Primary Burn:**\n    The total TBSA of this irregular burn is the sum of the contributions from each anatomical segment it covers.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} = \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{ant trunk}} + \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{post trunk}} + \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{left arm}} $$\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} = 4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.0\\% $$\n\n5.  **Handling the Secondary Burn:**\n    The problem states there is a superficial erythematous burn on the right thigh of $2\\%$ TBSA. The given rules explicitly state that such burns are not included in the TBSA calculation relevant for resuscitation. Therefore, this $2\\%$ is excluded.\n\n6.  **Final Resuscitation-Relevant TBSA:**\n    The final TBSA is the sum of all non-superficial burns.\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{total}} = 9.0\\% $$\n\n**Principle 2: Calculation of Full-Thickness TBSA**\n\nThe full-thickness component is a subset of the total burn area. The problem states that $30\\%$ of the \"traced shoulder–arm burn polygon\" is full thickness. The area of this polygon was calculated as $9.0\\%$ TBSA.\n\n1.  **Full-Thickness TBSA Calculation:**\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{full thickness}} = 30\\% \\times \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{primary burn}} $$\n    $$ \\text{TBSA}_{\\text{full thickness}} = 0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\% $$\n\nThe correct approach must therefore state that the TBSA is $9.0\\%$ and the full-thickness TBSA is $2.7\\%$, based on the principle of partitioning the burn and excluding superficial erythema.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Trace the burn once on an age-appropriate chart and partition strictly along anatomical segment boundaries (for example, mid-axillary line for anterior versus posterior trunk; acromial/glenohumeral transition for trunk versus arm) so that no area lies in two segments. Allocate fractional coverage to each segment and sum disjoint contributions: anterior trunk $25\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $4.5\\%$, posterior trunk $5\\%$ of $18\\%$ gives $0.9\\%$, and left arm $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ gives $3.6\\%$, totaling $9.0\\%$ TBSA burned. Treat depth categories as nested subsets: full-thickness TBSA is $30\\%$ of the traced polygon, i.e., $0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\%$. Exclude the $2\\%$ superficial thigh erythema from burned TBSA.**\n-   **Methodology**: The described method of partitioning and summing disjoint contributions is the scientifically correct way to prevent double counting. The treatment of depth categories as nested subsets is also correct. The exclusion of superficial erythema is correct.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculation of TBSA contributions from each segment ($4.5\\%$, $0.9\\%$, $3.6\\%$) and their sum ($9.0\\%$) is arithmetically correct. The calculation of full-thickness TBSA ($0.30 \\times 9.0\\% = 2.7\\%$) is also correct.\n-   **Verdict**: Correct. This option accurately describes the correct principles and performs all calculations flawlessly.\n\n**B. Sum coverage across all segments as in the tracing, then increase the total by the fraction that is full thickness to reflect severity. Include the superficial thigh since it is skin injury. Report $4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 9.0\\%$, then add $2.7\\%$ again for full thickness and $2.0\\%$ for the thigh, for a final total of $13.7\\%$.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option makes two major conceptual errors. First, it incorrectly adds the full-thickness area to the total burn area. Full-thickness burn is a *type* of burn within the total area, not an additional area. Second, it incorrectly includes superficial erythema in the resuscitation-relevant TBSA.\n-   **Calculations**: The initial summation to $9.0\\%$ is correct, but the subsequent additions are based on a flawed understanding of burn assessment. The final result of $13.7\\%$ is incorrect.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The methodology is fundamentally flawed.\n\n**C. To avoid double counting at boundaries, assign the entire shoulder–arm polygon to the single segment with the largest share and ignore the smaller shares. Classify depth by multiplying this segment’s contribution by the full-thickness fraction. Report $40\\%$ of $9\\%$ as $3.6\\%$ TBSA burned and $0.30 \\times 3.6\\% = 1.08\\%$ full-thickness TBSA.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option proposes an inaccurate and arbitrary approximation method (\"winner-take-all\") instead of the correct partitioning method. This would lead to significant errors. Here, it ignores the $4.5\\%$ and $0.9\\%$ contributions from the trunk.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculation is internally consistent with the flawed method but grossly underestimates the true TBSA ($3.6\\%$ vs the correct $9.0\\%$) and the full-thickness TBSA ($1.08\\%$ vs the correct $2.7\\%$).\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The method for handling boundaries is scientifically unsound.\n\n**D. Because the burn wraps over the shoulder, split at boundaries but double the trunk contribution to account for anterior–posterior continuity at the lateral chest. Report $2 \\times 4.5\\% + 0.9\\% + 3.6\\% = 13.5\\%$ TBSA burned, with full thickness $0.30 \\times 13.5\\% = 4.05\\%$, and add the superficial thigh $2.0\\%$ for a total of $15.5\\%$.**\n-   **Methodology**: This option introduces an arbitrary and incorrect rule to \"double the trunk contribution.\" This is a form of double counting, precisely what the correct partitioning method is designed to avoid. The mid-axillary line already provides a non-overlapping boundary. It also incorrectly includes the superficial burn.\n-   **Calculations**: The calculations are based on the flawed method, leading to a significant overestimation of TBSA ($13.5\\%$ vs $9.0\\%$) and a cascade of further errors.\n-   **Verdict**: Incorrect. The methodology is arbitrary and introduces double counting.",

            "problem": "A surgeon must decide at bedside whether a scald burn is superficial partial-thickness or deep partial-thickness, and in a separate adult patient must estimate burned Total Body Surface Area (TBSA). Use only the following foundational clinical facts as your base: (i) partial-thickness burns injure the epidermis and some portion of the dermis; more superficial injuries preserve a greater fraction of the superficial dermal microvasculature and cutaneous nociceptors, (ii) skin color reflects the degree of perfusion in the superficial dermal plexus, (iii) capillary refill after blanching is a surrogate for superficial dermal perfusion, (iv) blister roofs derive from the epidermis and their character reflects the integrity of the epidermal-dermal junction and subjacent perfusion, (v) pinprick sensation depends on free nerve endings in the superficial dermis, and (vi) standard adult body-surface-area approximations partition the body into regions with fixed proportional areas.\n\nPatient A: A $29$-year-old presents within $30$ minutes of a kitchen scald to the volar forearm and dorsum of the hand.

It is a valid and well-constructed problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: (1) deriving the clinical framework for burn classification, (2) classifying Patient A, and (3) calculating TBSA for Patient B.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Burn Classification Framework**\n\nThe framework is derived by synthesizing the foundational facts provided.\n\n**Superficial Partial-Thickness Burns:**\n*   **Pathophysiology (Fact i):** Injury is limited to the epidermis and the superficial (papillary) dermis. A large fraction of the superficial dermal microvasculature and cutaneous nociceptors are preserved.\n*   **Color (Fact ii):** Preserved and hyperemic microvasculature results in good perfusion, leading to a pink or red appearance.\n*   **Capillary Refill (Fact iii):** Intact and responsive microcirculation means that when pressure is applied (blanching), blood flow returns rapidly upon release. This is \"brisk\" capillary refill.\n*   **Blisters (Fact iv):** The separation of the epidermis from the dermis allows protein-rich serous fluid, driven by good subjacent perfusion, to accumulate, forming tense, thin-walled blisters filled with clear fluid.\n*   **Sensation (Fact v):** Preserved nerve endings (nociceptors) are irritated by the injury and inflammatory mediators, resulting in intact and often exquisite pain upon stimulation (e.g., pinprick).\n*   **Framework Summary (Superficial):** Pink to red, brisk capillary refill, thin-walled serous blisters, very painful.\n\n**Deep Partial-Thickness Burns:**\n*   **Pathophysiology (Fact i):** Injury extends into the deeper (reticular) dermis. A significant portion of the superficial dermal microvasculature and nociceptors are damaged or destroyed.\n*   **Color (Fact ii):** Damaged microvasculature leads to compromised perfusion. The appearance is often pale, waxy, or mottled (a mix of pale and red areas). If vessels are thrombosed but red cells have extravasated, the area may be fixed cherry-red and will not blanch.\n*   **Capillary Refill (Fact iii):** Compromised perfusion results in slow (\"sluggish\") or absent capillary refill.\n*   **Blisters (Fact iv):** Blisters, if they form, are often thicker-walled because the plane of cleavage is deeper. They are more likely to have already ruptured due to a weaker epidermal-dermal junction. Compromised vessels may lead to blood in the blister fluid (hemorrhagic blisters).\n*   **Sensation (Fact v):** Destruction of superficial nerve endings results in diminished or absent sensation to pinprick. Deeper pressure sensation may be preserved.\n*   **Framework Summary (Deep):** Pale, waxy, mottled, or non-blanching red; sluggish or absent capillary refill; thick-walled, ruptured, or hemorrhagic blisters; diminished or absent pinprick sensation.\n\n**2. Classification of Patient A**\n\nThe clinical signs of Patient A are compared to the derived framework.\n*   **Color:** \"moist, pink-to-red surface\"—Matches superficial partial-thickness.\n*   **Capillary Refill:** \"blanches... refills briskly (<2$ s)\"—Matches superficial partial-thickness.\n*   **Blisters:** \"thin-walled, tense, clear serous blisters\"—Matches superficial partial-thickness.\n*   **Sensation:** \"pinprick elicit severe pain\"—Matches superficial partial-thickness.\n\nTherefore, **Patient A has a superficial partial-thickness burn.**\n\n**3. TBSA Calculation for Patient B**\n\nThe calculation uses the standard adult \"Rule of Nines\" as indicated by Fact (vi).\nThe Rule of Nines partitions the adult body surface area as follows:\n*   Entire Head and Neck: $9\\%$\n*   Entire Anterior Trunk: $18\\%$\n*   Entire Posterior Trunk: $18\\%$\n*   Entire Right Upper Extremity: $9\\%$\n*   Entire Left Upper Extremity: $9\\%$\n*   Entire Right Lower Extremity: $18\\%$\n*   Entire Left Lower Extremity: $18\\%$\n*   Genitalia: $1\\%$\n\nPatient B has burns on:\n*   \"the entire anterior trunk\": This contributes $18\\%$ to the TBSA.\n*   \"both anterior lower extremities\": The anterior aspect of a single lower extremity is half of its total, which is $18\\% / 2 = 9\\%$. For both anterior lower extremities, the contribution is $2 \\times 9\\% = 18\\%$.\n*   \"the entire right upper extremity\": This contributes $9\\%$ to the TBSA.\n\nThe total burned TBSA is the sum of these areas:\n$$ TBSA = 18\\% (\\text{ant. trunk}) + 18\\% (\\text{both ant. legs}) + 9\\% (\\text{right arm}) = 45\\% $$\nTherefore, **Patient B's burned TBSA is $45\\%$.**\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Framework: Superficial partial-thickness burns show pink to red color with translucency, brisk capillary refill after blanching, thin-walled tense serous blisters, and exquisitely painful pinprick; deep partial-thickness burns show pale or waxy mottled areas (sometimes fixed cherry-red), sluggish or absent capillary refill, thicker or flat/ruptured and sometimes hemorrhagic blisters, and diminished pinprick with pressure sensation relatively preserved. Application: Patient A is superficial partial-thickness. Patient B’s TBSA is $45\\%$.**\n*   **Framework:** This framework is perfectly consistent with the one derived from the provided foundational facts. It correctly describes the distinguishing features of superficial and deep partial-thickness burns.\n*   **Application to Patient A:** The classification of Patient A as superficial partial-thickness is correct.\n*   **Application to Patient B:** The TBSA calculation of $45\\%$ is correct.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Framework: Superficial partial-thickness burns show sluggish capillary refill due to edema, thick-walled hemorrhagic blisters, and blunted pinprick; deep partial-thickness burns show brisk capillary refill from hyperemia, thin-walled serous blisters, and severe pinprick pain. Application: Patient A is deep partial-thickness. Patient B’s TBSA is $36\\%$.**\n*   **Framework:** This framework is incorrect. It inverts the characteristics of superficial and deep partial-thickness burns, contradicting the established pathophysiology.\n*   **Application to Patient A:** The classification of Patient A is incorrect.\n*   **Application to Patient B:** The TBSA calculation of $36\\%$ is incorrect. The correct value is $45\\%$.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Framework: Superficial partial-thickness burns have pale color with absent capillary refill and absent pinprick, whereas deep partial-thickness burns have pink color with brisk capillary refill and preserved pinprick. Application: Patient A is deep partial-thickness. Patient B’s TBSA is $27\\%$.**\n*   **Framework:** This framework is also incorrect and inverts the key distinguishing features, contradicting the foundational facts.\n*   **Application to Patient A:** The classification of Patient A is incorrect.\n*   **Application to Patient B:** The TBSA calculation of $27\\%$ is incorrect.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Framework: Superficial partial-thickness burns are cherry-red with no blanching and no pain due to nerve-ending destruction; deep partial-thickness burns are bright pink, blanch briskly, and are very painful. Application: Patient A is deep partial-thickness. Patient B’s TBSA is $40\\%$.**\n*   **Framework:** This framework is incorrect. It attributes signs of deep partial-thickness or full-thickness injury (non-blanching redness, no pain) to superficial partial-thickness burns and vice-versa.\n*   **Application to Patient A:** The classification of Patient A is incorrect.\n*   **Application to Patient B:** The TBSA calculation of $40\\%$ is incorrect.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only Option A presents a correct framework, a correct classification for Patient A, and a correct TBSA estimation for Patient B.",
