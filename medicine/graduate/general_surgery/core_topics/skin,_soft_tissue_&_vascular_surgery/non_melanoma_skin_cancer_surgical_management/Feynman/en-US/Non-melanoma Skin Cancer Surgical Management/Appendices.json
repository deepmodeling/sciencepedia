The lesion is approximately circular with a measured diameter of $7\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Following oncologic principles, the surgical margin is defined as a uniform buffer distance of $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ encircling the lesion.

Fusiform excision is a standard technique for removing cutaneous malignancies like Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC). The use of geometric models (circles, ellipses) and specified margins ($4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ for a standard BCC on the trunk is common) is a fundamental aspect of surgical planning. The $3{:}1$ length-to-width ratio for an ellipse is a widely accepted heuristic to ensure a cosmetically acceptable, flat closure. The problem is scientifically and clinically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($D$, $m$, and the ellipse ratio) and a clear set of objectives. The geometric model is explicitly defined, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language. It is free of subjective claims or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the dimensions of an elliptical excision designed to remove a circular lesion along with a uniform surgical margin.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Minor-Axis Width**\n\nLet $D$ be the diameter of the circular lesion. The radius of the lesion is $R = \\frac{D}{2}$.\nThe surgical plan requires a uniform margin of width $m$ to be excised around the entire periphery of the lesion. This means the total region to be removed is the original lesion plus this margin. Geometrically, this region is a larger, concentric circle.\n\nThe radius of this larger circle, let's call it $R_{total}$, is the sum of the lesion's radius and the margin width:\n$$R_{total} = R + m = \\frac{D}{2} + m$$\nThe diameter of this total region to be excised, $D_{total}$, is twice its radius:\n$$D_{total} = 2 R_{total} = 2 \\left( \\frac{D}{2} + m \\right) = D + 2m$$\nA fusiform (elliptical) excision must, at its widest point, encompass this entire diameter. This widest point of the ellipse corresponds to its minor axis. Therefore, the minor-axis width of the excision defect, which we shall denote as $W$, must be equal to the diameter of the lesion plus twice the margin.\n\nThe expression for the minor-axis width is:\n$$W = D + 2m$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Major-Axis Length**\n\nThe problem states that a standard $3{:}1$ ellipse design is used. This is a design rule relating the major axis length of the ellipse, denoted as $L$, to its minor axis width, $W$. The ratio is given as:\n$$\\frac{L}{W} = 3$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the major-axis length $L$ in terms of the minor-axis width $W$:\n$$L = 3W$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W$ derived in the previous step, we obtain the expression for the major-axis length in terms of the initial parameters $D$ and $m$:\n$$L = 3(D + 2m)$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the values $D = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $m = 4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We substitute these values into the derived expressions.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minor-axis width, $W$:\n$$W = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 2(4\\,\\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$W = 7\\,\\mathrm{mm} + 8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$W = 15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the major-axis length, $L$, using the calculated value of $W$:\n$$L = 3W = 3(15\\,\\mathrm{mm})$$\n$$L = 45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe value for the minor-axis width, $15\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, expressed to three significant figures is $15.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe value for the major-axis length, $45\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, expressed to three significant figures is $45.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe final answer consists of these two values, reported in millimeters.",

The true peripheral (lateral) margin is the entire lateral surface area of this cylinder. The specimen is processed by the pathology laboratory using bread-loafing: the specimen is cut with planes perpendicular to the long axis at uniform interval $s$, and from the center of each $s$-thick slice a single histologic section of thickness $h$ is obtained and examined. Assume the following idealized conditions:\n- The entire circumference $C$ of each examined histologic section is interpretable at the peripheral margin.\n- Only the thin histologic plane of thickness $h$ at each sampled axial position truly assesses the peripheral margin; no other unsampled tissue within a slice is considered assessed.\n- The specimen length $L$ is an exact integer multiple of the slice interval $s$.\n- Ignore the deep (end) margins and any minor geometric irregularities; focus solely on the lateral surface.\nUsing first principles of geometric area and sampling, derive the fraction $F$ of the true peripheral margin that is actually assessed as a function of $L$, $C$, $s$, and $h$, and then evaluate $F$ for a specimen of length $L = 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ with bread-loafing interval $s = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and histologic section thickness $h = 0.004\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (typical paraffin section thickness).

It is a modeling problem based on geometric principles applied to a standard procedure in surgical pathology. All parameters and assumptions are clearly defined, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the fraction $F$ of the true peripheral margin that is actually assessed. This fraction is defined as the ratio of the total assessed area to the true total area of the peripheral margin.\n$$F = \\frac{A_{\\text{assessed}}}{A_{\\text{true}}}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the true peripheral margin area, $A_{\\text{true}}$. The problem states that the specimen is modeled as a right circular cylinder of length $L$ and circumference $C$. The true peripheral margin is defined as the entire lateral surface area of this cylinder. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is its circumference multiplied by its length.\n$$A_{\\text{true}} = C \\times L$$\n\nNext, we determine the total assessed peripheral margin area, $A_{\\text{assessed}}$. The specimen is processed by \"bread-loafing\" into slices of uniform thickness $s$. Since the total length of the specimen is $L$, and $L$ is an exact integer multiple of $s$, the total number of slices, denoted by $N$, is:\n$$N = \\frac{L}{s}$$\nFrom each of these $N$ slices, a single histologic section of thickness $h$ is obtained and examined. The problem specifies that only the lateral surface of this thin histologic section of thickness $h$ is considered \"assessed\". For a single histologic section, which is a cylinder of circumference $C$ and height (thickness) $h$, the assessed area is its lateral surface area:\n$$A_{\\text{section}} = C \\times h$$\nThe total assessed area, $A_{\\text{assessed}}$, is the sum of the assessed areas from all $N$ histologic sections.

This is intuitive, as the sampling in the axial dimension directly determines the proportion of the lateral surface area that is examined.\n\nThe problem requires us to evaluate this fraction for the given values:\n- Length $L = 20\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ (This value is not needed for the final fraction calculation but confirms the number of slices is an integer: $N=20/2=10$).\n- Slice interval $s = 2\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Histologic section thickness $h = 0.004\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{0.004}{2}$$\n$$F = 0.002$$\n\nThe final step is to round the numerical answer to two significant figures. The calculated value $0.002$ has one significant figure (the digit $2$).

            "problem": "A $68$-year-old man presents with an infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the nasal ala measuring $1.2$ $\\text{cm}$, with ill-defined borders and focal numbness suggestive of early perineural involvement. The lesion lies within the nasal high-risk aesthetic and functional subunit (the \"H-zone\"). Two surgical strategies are considered: (i) standard elliptical excision with planned clinical margins and subsequent bread-loaf permanent-section histopathology, yielding negative margins; and (ii) Mohs micrographic surgery with intraoperative, en face margin assessment achieving complete clearance. Assume that postoperative adjuvant therapies are not given and that both surgeries are performed by experienced, fellowship-trained surgeons.\n\nIn aggressive nasal BCC, subclinical tumor extensions often track along embryonic fusion planes and perichondrial/periosteal interfaces; when margins are assessed by bread-loaf sectioning, only a fraction of the true peripheral and deep margin surface is examined microscopically, whereas Mohs micrographic surgery evaluates essentially the entire circumferential and deep margin surface in real time. Let $f_{\\text{SE}}$ denote the fraction of the true margin surface evaluated histologically by standard excision bread-loafing and $f_{\\text{MMS}}$ the analogous fraction for Mohs micrographic surgery, with $f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$ and $f_{\\text{MMS}} \\approx 1$. Let $q$ represent the proportion of margin segments harboring subclinical tumor extensions in infiltrative nasal BCC.

Even when permanent sections are negative, standard excision has a higher hazard of local recurrence across time than Mohs micrographic surgery for aggressive nasal BCC, due to limited margin sampling ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$) and the H-zone’s propensity for subclinical spread ($q > 0$); consequently, the $5$-$\\text{year}$ cumulative recurrence is higher after standard excision.\n\nC.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient Profile:** A $68$-year-old man.\n-   **Diagnosis:** Infiltrative basal cell carcinoma (BCC).\n-   **Lesion Characteristics:** Located on the nasal ala, measuring $1.2$ $\\text{cm}$, with ill-defined borders, and focal numbness suggestive of early perineural involvement.\n-   **Location Context:** The lesion is in the \"H-zone,\" a high-risk area.\n-   **Surgical Option (i):** Standard elliptical excision (SE) with planned clinical margins, followed by bread-loaf permanent-section histopathology.

The characterization of infiltrative BCC, the significance of the H-zone, the potential for perineural invasion, and the patterns of subclinical spread are all factually correct and clinically relevant. The descriptions of standard \"bread-loaf\" pathology versus Mohs \"en face\" complete margin assessment are accurate. The mathematical formalization using fractions $f_{\\text{SE}}$ and $f_{\\text{MMS}}$ and the hazard function $h(t)$ is a legitimate and standard way to model such a problem in biostatistics and epidemiology.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear clinical scenario, two distinct procedures with their known methodological limitations and strengths, and a mathematical model linking the procedure's efficacy to a clinical outcome (recurrence). A single, logical conclusion about the relative risks can be derived from these premises.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and objective. It avoids subjective or opinion-based claims and rests on formal definitions and established clinical facts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and well-posed. It presents a realistic clinical scenario and asks for a conclusion based on a clearly defined model of surgical efficacy and recurrence risk. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. The solution will proceed by analyzing the model provided.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe central thesis of the problem is that the instantaneous hazard of local recurrence, $h(t)$, is a monotonically increasing function of the probability of residual microscopic tumor at the completion of surgery. Let this probability be $P(\\text{residual tumor})$. Therefore, to compare the recurrence risk profiles, we must compare $P(\\text{residual tumor})$ for standard excision (SE) and Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS).\n\n1.  **Probability of Residual Tumor for Standard Excision (SE):**\n    The SE procedure involves excising the tumor with a planned margin and then assessing the margin using \"bread-loaf\" sectioning. The problem specifies that this method examines only a small fraction of the true margin surface, $f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$. The pathology report came back as \"negative margins.\"\n\n    This \"negative\" report does not mean the margin is truly free of tumor. It means that in the small fraction of the margin that was sampled ($f_{\\text{SE}}$), no tumor was found. Given that the tumor is infiltrative, has ill-defined borders, is in the H-zone, and shows signs of early perineural involvement, there is a significant a priori probability that microscopic tumor extensions exist at the surgical margin. The problem formalizes this with $q > 0$.\n\n    The process of bread-loafing is a sampling technique. When sampling is sparse ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$), the probability of missing a small, focal area of residual tumor (a false negative) is high. Let $T_{\\text{res}}$ be the event of true residual tumor, and $E_{\\text{neg}}$ be the event of a \"negative\" pathology report. We are concerned with $P(T_{\\text{res}} | E_{\\text{neg}})$. Due to the high chance of sampling error, a negative report from a low-coverage test does not reduce the posterior probability of disease to zero. Therefore, for standard excision in this high-risk scenario, $P_{\\text{SE}}(\\text{residual tumor}) > 0$, and is non-negligible.\n\n2.  **Probability of Residual Tumor for Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS):**\n    The MMS procedure involves intraoperative, en face margin assessment, which evaluates essentially the entire circumferential and deep margin surface, $f_{\\text{MMS}} \\approx 1$. The problem states this process is continued until \"complete clearance\" is achieved.\n\n    Because nearly $100\\%$ of the margin is examined, the probability of missing a focus of residual tumor is exceedingly low. The false-negative rate of MMS is, by its very design, minimized. Therefore, a report of \"complete clearance\" from MMS corresponds to a very high certainty that no tumor remains. The probability of residual tumor after MMS is very close to zero: $P_{\\text{MMS}}(\\text{residual tumor}) \\approx 0$.\n\n3.  **Comparison of Recurrence Risk:**\n    Based on the analysis above, we have established:\n    $$P_{\\text{SE}}(\\text{residual tumor}) \\gg P_{\\text{MMS}}(\\text{residual tumor}) \\approx 0$$\n    The problem states that the hazard of recurrence, $h(t)$, is monotonically increasing with the probability of residual tumor. Let $h_{\\text{SE}}(t)$ and $h_{\\text{MMS}}(t)$ be the hazard functions for standard excision and Mohs, respectively. It follows directly that:\n    $$h_{\\text{SE}}(t) > h_{\\text{MMS}}(t) \\text{ for } t > 0$$\n    The cumulative recurrence at $5$ years is derived from the hazard function. The survival function (probability of being recurrence-free) is $S(T) = \\exp(-\\int_0^T h(\\tau) d\\tau)$. Since $h_{\\text{SE}}(t) > h_{\\text{MMS}}(t)$, the integral of the hazard function will be greater for SE. This means the survival function for SE will be lower than for MMS, $S_{\\text{SE}}(5) < S_{\\text{MMS}}(5)$.\n    The cumulative recurrence is $1 - S(T)$. Therefore, the $5$-year cumulative recurrence rate for standard excision will be higher than for Mohs surgery.\n    $$1 - S_{\\text{SE}}(5) > 1 - S_{\\text{MMS}}(5)$$\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. With negative permanent margins, standard excision and Mohs micrographic surgery have equivalent recurrence hazards and cumulative recurrence over $5$ $\\text{years}$, because margin negativity eliminates residual tumor irrespective of how margins are examined.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. It conflates a *report* of \"negative margins\" with the *ontological state* of the margin being tumor-free. The core of the problem is that the reliability of this report depends critically on *how* the margins are examined. The limited sampling of standard excision ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$) creates a significant risk of a false-negative result, which is not equivalent to the near-complete examination of Mohs surgery ($f_{\\text{MMS}} \\approx 1$). Therefore, the risks are not equivalent.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Even when permanent sections are negative, standard excision has a higher hazard of local recurrence across time than Mohs micrographic surgery for aggressive nasal BCC, due to limited margin sampling ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$) and the H-zone’s propensity for subclinical spread ($q > 0$); consequently, the $5$-$\\text{year}$ cumulative recurrence is higher after standard excision.**\nThis statement accurately captures the entire logical argument derived above. It correctly identifies limited margin sampling ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$) as the key weakness of standard excision in this context. It correctly notes that for an aggressive tumor ($q > 0$), this weakness leads to a higher probability of residual disease despite a \"negative\" report. It correctly concludes that this higher probability of residual disease translates to a higher hazard of recurrence ($h_{\\text{SE}}(t) > h_{\\text{MMS}}(t)$) and consequently a higher cumulative $5$-year recurrence rate.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Mohs micrographic surgery has a higher early recurrence hazard than standard excision because tissue preservation increases the probability of residual foci immediately postoperatively, but a lower late hazard due to improved host control, yielding a lower $5$-$\\text{year}$ cumulative recurrence despite an initially higher hazard.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The premise that tissue preservation in MMS \"increases the probability of residual foci\" is the opposite of the procedure's goal and mechanism. MMS aims for tissue preservation *without compromising oncologic clearance*. The comprehensive margin analysis is designed to achieve the *lowest* possible probability of residual foci. Therefore, MMS should have the lowest possible early recurrence hazard, not the highest.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Standard excision yields lower recurrence than Mohs micrographic surgery in aggressive nasal BCC without overt perineural invasion symptoms because wider planned clinical margins reduce residual microscopic disease more effectively than margin mapping, making Mohs unnecessary when permanent margins are negative.**\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, it contradicts the problem's given information, which is \"focal numbness suggestive of early perineural involvement.\" Second, the claim that pre-planned wide margins are more effective than real-time margin mapping for infiltrative tumors with unpredictable extension patterns is clinically and logically unsubstantiated; in fact, the opposite is the rationale for using MMS in such cases. Finally, it repeats the logical error of assuming a \"negative\" report from a poorly sampled specimen is definitive proof of clearance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. When margins are negative on permanent sections, both techniques have negligible recurrence, and any observed difference at $5$ $\\text{years}$ reflects surveillance bias rather than true biological or methodological differences.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It dismisses the fundamental methodological difference ($f_{\\text{SE}} \\ll 1$ vs. $f_{\\text{MMS}} \\approx 1$) that is the basis of the problem. For a high-risk tumor like the one described, the recurrence rate after standard excision is known to be non-negligible, precisely because of the sampling error that this option ignores. Attributing the well-documented superior outcomes of MMS for high-risk BCC to \"surveillance bias\" is contrary to the established evidence and the direct implications of the problem's physical model. The problem is explicitly constructed to highlight a true difference based on methodology.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
