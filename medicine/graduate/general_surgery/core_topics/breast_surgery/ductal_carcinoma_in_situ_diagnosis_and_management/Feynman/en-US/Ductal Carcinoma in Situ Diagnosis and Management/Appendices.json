            "problem": "A patient with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) diagnosed on core needle biopsy is being evaluated for definitive surgical management. Your institution uses a baseline underestimation probability $p_0$ for upgrade to invasive carcinoma at surgical excision derived from pooled prospective cohorts. The baseline is $p_0 = 0.12$. To refine patient-specific risk, a logistic model is applied in which each independent risk factor multiplies the baseline odds by its odds ratio. For this patient, the following risk modifiers are present:\n- High nuclear grade with odds ratio $\\text{OR}_{\\text{grade}} = 1.9$.\n- Palpable mass with odds ratio $\\text{OR}_{\\text{palpable}} = 1.6$.\n\nAssume the risk modifiers act independently on the odds scale and that the multiplicative odds framework is valid. Starting from the definitions of probability, odds, and odds ratio as used in logistic regression, compute the expected probability $p$ of upgrade to invasive cancer at excision for this patient.\n\nRound your answer to four significant figures and express the final probability as a decimal (no percent sign).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the updated probability of finding invasive carcinoma upon surgical excision for a patient with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS), given a baseline probability and several risk modifiers with their associated odds ratios. The solution involves converting the baseline probability to odds, applying the odds ratios to calculate the new odds, and then converting these new odds back to a probability.\n\nFirst, we must establish the mathematical a relationship between probability ($p$) and odds ($O$). The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability that the event will occur to the probability that it will not occur.\n$$\nO = \\frac{p}{1-p}\n$$\nConversely, the probability can be derived from the odds using the following formula:\n$$\np = \\frac{O}{1+O}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the baseline probability of underestimation, $p_0$, which is the probability of upgrade to invasive carcinoma for a patient without the specified risk factors.\n$$\np_0 = 0.12\n$$\nWe first calculate the baseline odds, $O_0$, corresponding to this baseline probability.\n$$\nO_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.12}{1 - 0.12} = \\frac{0.12}{0.88}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$\nO_0 = \\frac{12}{88} = \\frac{3}{22}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the logistic model applies risk modifiers by multiplying the baseline odds by the odds ratio ($\\text{OR}$) for each factor. The patient has two risk factors: high nuclear grade with $\\text{OR}_{\\text{grade}} = 1.9$ and a palpable mass with $\\text{OR}_{\\text{palpable}} = 1.6$. Since the risk modifiers act independently, the final odds, $O_f$, are calculated by multiplying the baseline odds by each of the given odds ratios.\n$$\nO_f = O_0 \\times \\text{OR}_{\\text{grade}} \\times \\text{OR}_{\\text{palpable}}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nO_f = \\left(\\frac{3}{22}\\right) \\times 1.9 \\times 1.6\n$$\nWe can perform this multiplication. First, let's multiply the odds ratios:\n$$\n1.9 \\times 1.6 = 3.04\n$$\nNow, we multiply this by the baseline odds:\n$$\nO_f = \\frac{3}{22} \\times 3.04 = \\frac{3 \\times 3.04}{22} = \\frac{9.12}{22}\n$$\nTo work with exact fractions, we can write $3.04$ as $\\frac{304}{100} = \\frac{76}{25}$.\n$$\nO_f = \\frac{3}{22} \\times \\frac{76}{25} = \\frac{3}{11 \\times 2} \\times \\frac{2 \\times 38}{25} = \\frac{3 \\times 38}{11 \\times 25} = \\frac{114}{275}\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert these final odds, $O_f$, back into the final probability, $p$, of upgrade to invasive cancer.\n$$\np = \\frac{O_f}{1+O_f}\n$$\nSubstituting the fractional value for $O_f$:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\frac{114}{275}}{1 + \\frac{114}{275}} = \\frac{\\frac{114}{275}}{\\frac{275}{275} + \\frac{114}{275}} = \\frac{\\frac{114}{275}}{\\frac{275+114}{275}} = \\frac{114}{389}\n$$\nNow, we compute the decimal value of this fraction.\n$$\np = \\frac{114}{389} \\approx 0.29305912596...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $3$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which means we must round up the last digit of our four-figure result.\n$$\np \\approx 0.2931\n$$\nThis is the expected probability of upgrade to invasive cancer for this patient.",

After formalin fixation, the tissue dimensions uniformly contracted by a factor $\\sigma=0.93$ relative to the fresh state.\n\nUse the following data:\n\n- Radiograph center-to-ink distances measured on the fresh specimen (pre-fixation) are: medial $D_{M}^{\\mathrm{pre}}=18.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, lateral $D_{L}^{\\mathrm{pre}}=16.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, superficial $D_{S}^{\\mathrm{pre}}=15.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, deep $D_{D}^{\\mathrm{pre}}=17.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n- Histologic mapping after fixation (post-fixation) identified Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) in three serial sections positioned along the $x$-axis at $x=-9.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $x=-3.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and $x=+8.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.

All calculations are performed in the post-fixation coordinate frame.\n\n**1. Compute the Post-fixation DCIS Extent**\n\nThe extent of the DCIS is defined by the minimal and maximal coordinates where it is found.\n\n- **Extent along the long axis ($x$)**:\nThe DCIS is found at histologic sections located at $x=-9.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, $x=-3.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, and $x=+8.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Assuming continuity between these points, the extent of the DCIS along the $x$-axis is the interval spanned by the minimum and maximum of these coordinates.\n$$x_{\\mathrm{DCIS, min}} = \\min(-9.0, -3.0, 8.0) = -9.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$x_{\\mathrm{DCIS, max}} = \\max(-9.0, -3.0, 8.0) = 8.0\\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe full extent of the DCIS along the $x$-axis is the interval $[-9.0, 8.0]\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n- **Extent along the short axis ($y$)**:\nThe extent along the $y$-axis is the union of the $y$-intervals where DCIS was found.\nThe intervals are $y \\in [-4.5, 2.0]$, $y \\in [-6.5, 5.0]$, and $y \\in [-2.5, 1.0]$.
