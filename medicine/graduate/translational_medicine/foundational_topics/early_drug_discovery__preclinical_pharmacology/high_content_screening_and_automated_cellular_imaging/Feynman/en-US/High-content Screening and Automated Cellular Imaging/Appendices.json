Determine if the current configuration satisfies Nyquist sampling at the specimen plane.\n2. If not, derive the minimum total magnification $M_{\\min}$ that does.\n3. Justify whether pixel binning could help.\n4. State a practical magnification adjustment.\n5. Report $M_{\\min}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of Fourier optics and the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem as applied to digital imaging. The parameters provided are realistic for a high-performance HCS system. The questions are well-posed and lead to a unique, verifiable solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\n#### Optical Resolution and Band Limit\nFor an incoherent imaging system, the optical transfer function (OTF) is non-zero only for spatial frequencies up to a certain cut-off frequency, determined by the numerical aperture ($\\mathrm{NA}$) of the objective and the wavelength ($\\lambda$) of the imaged light. This cut-off frequency, $k_{\\text{cutoff}}$, represents the highest spatial frequency information that the objective can transmit. In the specimen plane, it is given by:\n$$\nk_{\\text{cutoff}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis formula defines the spatial frequency band-limit of the image formed by the objective.\n\n#### The Nyquist Sampling Criterion\nThe Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem states that to faithfully represent a signal that is band-limited to a maximum frequency $f_{\\text{max}}$, the sampling frequency, $f_s$, must be at least twice this maximum frequency: $f_s \\ge 2 \\cdot f_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nIn the context of spatial imaging, the maximum frequency is $k_{\\text{cutoff}}$. Therefore, the required sampling frequency in the specimen plane, which we will call the Nyquist frequency $k_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, must be:\n$$\nk_{\\text{Nyquist}} \\ge 2 \\cdot k_{\\text{cutoff}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_{\\text{cutoff}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\text{Nyquist}} \\ge 2 \\left( \\frac{2 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{4 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe sampling interval is the reciprocal of the sampling frequency. Thus, the Nyquist criterion requires that the sampling interval in the specimen, $\\Delta x$, must be smaller than or equal to the Nyquist sampling interval, $\\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta x \\le \\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{1}{k_{\\text{Nyquist}}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}\n$$\nThis expression defines the maximum permissible spacing between samples in the specimen plane to avoid aliasing and preserve all spatial information passed by the objective.\n\n#### Effective Sampling Interval of the System\nThe camera samples the magnified image with a pixel pitch of $p$. The total magnification $M$ scales the image. The effective sampling interval at the specimen plane, $\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}}$, is the physical pixel pitch divided by the total magnification:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{p}{M}\n$$\n\n#### Analysis of the Current Configuration ($M=40$)\nWe first calculate the required Nyquist sampling interval, $\\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, using the given parameters $\\lambda = 520 \\ \\mathrm{nm} = 0.520 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $\\mathrm{NA} = 0.95$.\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}} = \\frac{0.520 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{4 \\cdot (0.95)} = \\frac{0.520 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{3.8} \\approx 0.13684 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the actual effective sampling interval, $\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}}$, for the current configuration with $p = 6.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $M = 40$.\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{p}{M} = \\frac{6.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{40} = 0.1625 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nTo satisfy the Nyquist criterion, we must have $\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}} \\le \\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}}$.\nComparing the values:\n$$\n0.1625 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} > 0.13684 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nSince the actual sampling interval is larger than the maximum allowed interval, the current configuration with $M=40$ is undersampled and does not satisfy the Nyquist criterion.\n\n#### Derivation of the Minimum Required Magnification ($M_{\\min}$)\nTo satisfy the Nyquist criterion, the magnification $M$ must be sufficiently large. We set the condition for sampling to be at the Nyquist limit:\n$$\n\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}} \\le \\Delta x_{\\text{Nyquist}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p}{M} \\le \\frac{\\lambda}{4 \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}\n$$\nTo find the minimum magnification, $M_{\\min}$, we solve the inequality for $M$:\n$$\nM \\ge \\frac{4 \\cdot p \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\n$$\nTherefore, the minimum required magnification is:\n$$\nM_{\\min} = \\frac{4 \\cdot p \\cdot \\mathrm{NA}}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nM_{\\min} = \\frac{4 \\cdot (6.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot (0.95)}{0.520 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nThe units of length ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) cancel, leaving a dimensionless magnification factor as expected.\n$$\nM_{\\min} = \\frac{26 \\cdot 0.95}{0.520} = \\frac{24.7}{0.520} = 47.5\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the minimum magnification required is $M_{\\min} = 47.50$.\n\n#### Role of Pixel Binning\nPixel binning is a camera operation where the charge from an $N \\times N$ group of adjacent pixels is summed on-chip before readout, creating a single \"super-pixel\". For example, $2 \\times 2$ binning results in a super-pixel with an effective pitch of $2p$. This increases the effective sampling interval at the specimen to $\\Delta x_{\\text{eff, binned}} = (N \\cdot p) / M$. Since the current system is already undersampled ($\\Delta x_{\\text{eff}}$ is too large), increasing the effective pixel pitch through binning would only worsen the undersampling. Pixel binning is therefore counterproductive for resolving undersampling issues; it is typically used to improve signal-to-noise ratio or frame rate at the expense of spatial resolution when a system is oversampled.\n\n#### Practical Magnification Adjustment\nThe calculated minimum required magnification is $M_{\\min} = 47.50$. Standard microscope objectives are typically available in discrete magnification steps (e.g., $40\\times, 60\\times, 100\\times$). A custom $47.5\\times$ objective is not a practical option. A practical solution is to increase the total magnification beyond this minimum value using available components. Two common approaches are:\n1.  Replace the $40\\times$ objective with the next standard higher-magnification objective, which is typically a $60\\times$ objective. This would yield a total magnification of $M=60$, which is greater than $M_{\\min}=47.50$, thus satisfying the Nyquist criterion (and resulting in oversampling).\n2.  Insert an intermediate magnification changer (often called an Optovar or zoom body) into the optical path. For instance, using the existing $40\\times$ objective with a $1.25\\times$ magnification changer would produce a total magnification of $M = 40 \\times 1.25 = 50$, which also satisfies the requirement.\n\nEither approach is a practical way to meet the sampling requirement. Switching to a $60\\times$ objective is a common and straightforward solution.",

The experimental setup and modeling assumptions are as follows.\n\n- Photon arrivals from the sample to each pixel are well-approximated as a Poisson process whose mean equals the expected photon count over the exposure. The camera converts incident photons to electrons with a quantum efficiency (QE). The camera saturates irreversibly at its full-well capacity, meaning that if the accumulated photoelectrons before readout exceed this capacity, the pixel clips.\n- The camera adds independent, signal-independent read noise that is approximately Gaussian with a known root-mean-square (RMS) value. Dark current is negligible over the exposure times of interest, and photobleaching is negligible within a single exposure.\n- The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a pixel of interest is defined as the mean signal electrons from the biomarker at that pixel divided by the standard deviation arising from the combined shot noise of signal and background plus read noise.\n\nYou are constrained to adjust only the exposure time $t$; illumination intensity and optical throughput are fixed. The following quantities have been measured or specified for the imaging condition and the cellular sample:\n\n- Camera full-well capacity $C = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$ electrons.\n- Camera quantum efficiency $\\mathrm{QE} = 0.90$ electrons per photon.\n- Camera read noise standard deviation $\\sigma_{r} = 1.2$ electrons RMS.\n- Uniform background photon flux per pixel $\\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$ photons per second.\n- Among all pixels in the field, the upper-tail brightness that constrains clipping corresponds to a pixel with mean signal photon flux $\\phi_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ photons per second in this channel.\n- The pixel for which you wish to maximize SNR (your analysis target) has mean signal photon flux $\\phi_{t} = 1.0 \\times 10^{5}$ photons per second.\n\nModel the pre-readout electron count at any pixel as the sum of independent Poisson contributions from signal and background, each scaled by $\\mathrm{QE}$, and note that read noise does not contribute to clipping because clipping occurs before readout. To ensure that clipping is negligible at the constraining bright pixel, impose the requirement that, with probability at least $0.997$, the pre-readout electron count at that bright pixel remains below $C$. Use a three-standard-deviation bound under the Poisson model for this purpose.\n\nUnder these assumptions, determine the exposure time $t^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the SNR at the target pixel subject to the non-clipping requirement at the bright pixel. Express your final answer as the exposure time in milliseconds, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the optimal exposure time $t^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a target pixel, subject to a constraint that prevents saturation (clipping) at the brightest pixel in the field of view.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at the target pixel as a function of the exposure time $t$. The SNR is defined as the mean signal electrons divided by the total noise in electrons.\n\nThe mean signal, $S(t)$, is the number of photoelectrons generated from the signal photon flux at the target pixel, $\\phi_t$.\nGiven the quantum efficiency $\\mathrm{QE}$, the mean signal is:\n$$S(t) = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot \\phi_t \\cdot t$$\n\nThe total noise, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}(t)$, is the combination of shot noise and read noise. These are independent noise sources, so their variances add in quadrature.\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2(t) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{shot}}^2(t) + \\sigma_{r}^2$$\nThe read noise standard deviation $\\sigma_r$ is given.\nThe shot noise arises from the statistical nature of photon detection and follows Poisson statistics. Its variance is equal to the mean number of total photoelectrons detected. The total flux at the target pixel is the sum of the signal flux $\\phi_t$ and the background flux $\\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}$.\nThe mean total number of photoelectrons at the target pixel, $\\mu_{e,t}(t)$, is:\n$$\\mu_{e,t}(t) = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t$$\nThus, the shot noise variance is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{shot}}^2(t) = \\mu_{e,t}(t) = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t$$\nThe total noise variance is:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}^2(t) = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t + \\sigma_r^2$$\nTherefore, the SNR as a function of time $t$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}(t) = \\frac{S(t)}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{total}}(t)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot \\phi_t \\cdot t}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t + \\sigma_r^2}}$$\nTo determine how to maximize $\\mathrm{SNR}(t)$, we examine its behavior as a function of $t$. Let's analyze the derivative of $\\mathrm{SNR}^2(t)$ with respect to $t$, as it is simpler and has the same sign as the derivative of $\\mathrm{SNR}(t)$ for $t > 0$.\n$$\\mathrm{SNR}^2(t) = \\frac{(\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot \\phi_t)^2 \\cdot t^2}{\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t + \\sigma_r^2}$$\nLet $A = (\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot \\phi_t)^2$, $B = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_t + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}})$, and $D = \\sigma_r^2$.\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\mathrm{SNR}^2(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{A t^2}{B t + D} \\right) = \\frac{2At(Bt+D) - At^2(B)}{(Bt+D)^2} = \\frac{2ABt^2 + 2ADt - ABt^2}{(Bt+D)^2} = \\frac{ABt^2 + 2ADt}{(Bt+D)^2}$$\nFor any positive exposure time $t > 0$, the constants $A$, $B$, and $D$ are all positive. Therefore, the numerator $ABt^2 + 2ADt$ is positive, and the denominator $(Bt+D)^2$ is also positive. This means that $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathrm{SNR}^2(t) > 0$ for all $t > 0$. Consequently, $\\mathrm{SNR}(t)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the exposure time $t$.\n\nTo maximize a monotonically increasing function subject to an upper-bound constraint, one must choose the maximum possible value allowed by the constraint. The constraint is set by the non-clipping requirement at the brightest pixel.\n\nLet's formalize the non-clipping constraint. The total photon flux at the brightest pixel is $\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}$. The mean number of photoelectrons generated at this pixel in time $t$ is:\n$$\\mu_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t) = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t$$\nThe number of photoelectrons, $N_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}$, is a Poisson-distributed random variable with mean $\\mu_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t)$. Its standard deviation is $\\sigma_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t) = \\sqrt{\\mu_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t)}$.\nThe problem requires that the probability of the electron count remaining below the full-well capacity $C$ is at least $0.997$. This is to be enforced using a three-standard-deviation ($3\\sigma$) bound. This translates to the condition:\n$$\\mu_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t) + 3 \\sigma_{e, \\mathrm{bright}}(t) \\le C$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mean and standard deviation:\n$$\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t + 3 \\sqrt{\\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) \\cdot t} \\le C$$\nLet's define a rate constant $k = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}})$. The inequality becomes:\n$$kt + 3\\sqrt{kt} - C \\le 0$$\nLet $x = \\sqrt{kt}$. Since $k > 0$ and $t \\ge 0$, we have $x \\ge 0$. The inequality in terms of $x$ is:\n$$x^2 + 3x - C \\le 0$$\nThis is a quadratic inequality for $x$. The roots of the corresponding equation $x^2 + 3x - C = 0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$x = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{3^2 - 4(1)(-C)}}{2} = \\frac{-3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 + 4C}}{2}$$\nSince $x$ must be non-negative, the valid range for $x$ that satisfies the inequality is:\n$$0 \\le x \\le \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4C}}{2}$$\nSubstituting back $x = \\sqrt{kt}$:\n$$\\sqrt{kt} \\le \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4C}}{2}$$\nSquaring both sides and solving for $t$, we find the maximum allowed exposure time, $t_{\\max}$:\n$$t \\le \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4C}}{2} \\right)^2$$\nThus, $t_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4C}}{2} \\right)^2$.\nAs shown earlier, the optimal time $t^{\\ast}$ is this maximum allowed time: $t^{\\ast} = t_{\\max}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$C = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$ electrons\n$\\mathrm{QE} = 0.90$ electrons/photon\n$\\phi_{\\max} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5}$ photons/s\n$\\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$ photons/s\n\nFirst, calculate the rate constant $k$:\n$$k = \\mathrm{QE} \\cdot (\\phi_{\\max} + \\phi_{\\mathrm{bg}}) = 0.90 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{5} + 5.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\n$$k = 0.90 \\times (5.5 \\times 10^{5}) \\text{ s}^{-1} = 4.95 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ s}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 4 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{4})}}{2} \\right)^2 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{9 + 120000}}{2} \\right)^2 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\left( \\frac{-3 + \\sqrt{120009}}{2} \\right)^2 \\text{ s}$$\nUsing a calculator for the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{120009} \\approx 346.42315$$\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\left( \\frac{-3 + 346.42315}{2} \\right)^2 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\left( \\frac{343.42315}{2} \\right)^2 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{1}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} (171.711575)^2 \\text{ s}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{29485.03}{4.95 \\times 10^{5}} \\text{ s} \\approx 0.0595657 \\text{ s}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in milliseconds, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx 0.0595657 \\times 1000 \\text{ ms} = 59.5657 \\text{ ms}$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx 59.57 \\text{ ms}$$",

A positive signal window, as in this case, indicates that the $3\\sigma$ distributions of the controls do not overlap, which is consistent with the positive $Z'$-factor.\n\n3) We must find the smallest integer number of replicates $R$ such that the resulting $Z' \\ge 0.5$. When averaging $R$ independent and identically distributed wells, the mean of the averaged readout remains $\\mu$, but the standard deviation of the averaged readout becomes $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{R}}$.\nSo, for a given $R$, the standard deviations become:\n$\\sigma_{p,R} = \\frac{\\sigma_{p,1}}{\\sqrt{R}} = \\frac{960}{\\sqrt{R}}$\n$\\sigma_{n,R} = \\frac{\\sigma_{n,1}}{\\sqrt{R}} = \\frac{720}{\\sqrt{R}}$\n\nThe $Z'$-factor as a function of $R$ is:\n$$Z'(R) = 1 - \\frac{3(\\sigma_{p,R} + \\sigma_{n,R})}{|\\mu_p - \\mu_n|} = 1 - \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{960}{\\sqrt{R}} + \\frac{720}{\\sqrt{R}}\\right)}{|8500 - 2500|}$$\n$$Z'(R) = 1 - \\frac{3\\left(\\frac{1680}{\\sqrt{R}}\\right)}{6000} = 1 - \\frac{5040}{6000\\sqrt{R}} = 1 - \\frac{0.84}{\\sqrt{R}}$$\nWe set the condition $Z'(R) \\ge 0.5$:\n$$1 - \\frac{0.84}{\\sqrt{R}} \\ge 0.5$$\n$$0.5 \\ge \\frac{0.84}{\\sqrt{R}}$$\n$$\\sqrt{R} \\ge \\frac{0.84}{0.5}$$\n$$\\sqrt{R} \\ge 1.68$$\n$$R \\ge (1.68)^2$$\n$$R \\ge 2.8224$$\nSince $R$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $R$ that satisfies this inequality is $3$.\n\nThe three requested values are:\n- $Z'$ for $R=1$: $0.1600$\n- Signal window for $R=1$: $960.0$ AFU\n- Smallest integer $R$ for $Z' \\ge 0.5$: $3$",
