This demonstrates that P-gp is responsible for the vast majority of the observed efflux activity. The permeability values in both directions become nearly symmetrical, suggesting they now primarily reflect the compound's intrinsic passive permeability.\n\n2.  **Effect of BCRP inhibition (with Ko143):**\n    -   $P_{\\mathrm{app,\\,A\\to B}}$ increases moderately from $0.45 \\times 10^{-6}$ to $0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n    -   $P_{\\mathrm{app,\\,B\\to A}}$ decreases moderately from $6.30 \\times 10^{-6}$ to $4.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n    -   The efflux ratio in the presence of the BCRP inhibitor is:\n        $$\n        ER_{\\mathrm{BCRP\\,inhibited}} = \\frac{4.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 6.0\n        $$\n    -   While BCRP inhibition reduces the efflux ratio from $14.0$ to $6.0$, a significant level of efflux activity remains. This indicates that while the compound is likely a substrate for BCRP, this transporter's contribution is substantially less than that of P-gp.\n\n**Conclusion on Dominant Transporter:** The dramatic reduction of the efflux ratio to near unity upon P-gp inhibition, compared with the more modest reduction upon BCRP inhibition, provides clear evidence that **P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux is dominant** for this compound.\n\nTo rigorously demonstrate that P-gp is the dominant efflux transporter for this compound, all three experimental conditions presented in the problem (baseline, P-gp inhibition, BCRP inhibition) are necessary controls to rigorously support the conclusion that P-gp is the dominant efflux transporter over BCRP for this compound in this system.\n\nThe question asks for the efflux ratio as the final answer.

The focus is on hepatic clearance under the well-stirred liver assumption at steady state with linear (first-order) metabolism. The liver is modeled as a single, well-mixed compartment obeying conservation of mass, where the hepatic extraction ratio is defined by the difference between inflow and outflow concentrations over the inflow concentration, and intrinsic metabolic conversion is driven by unbound drug within the liver.\n\nTwo compounds, A and B, share the same species context with hepatic blood flow $Q_h = 20\\,\\mathrm{mL\\,min^{-1}\\,kg^{-1}}$.

The hepatic blood flow is $Q_h$. The rate of entry is $Q_h C_{in}$ and the rate of exit is $Q_h C_{out}$.\n\nThe rate of elimination is driven by the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{int}$, acting on the unbound drug concentration inside the liver. The well-stirred assumption posits that the drug concentration within the liver is uniform and equal to the outflow concentration, $C_{out}$. If $f_u$ is the unbound fraction of the drug in the blood (assumed to be the same as in the liver), the unbound concentration is $f_u C_{out}$.

Rounding to four significant figures gives $R = 2.571$.\n\nJustification:\nThe derived equation $CL_h = \\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h + f_u CL_{int}}$ reveals two distinct kinetic regimes based on the magnitude of the unbound intrinsic clearance, $f_u CL_{int}$, relative to the hepatic blood flow, $Q_h$.\n\n1.  Low-Extraction Regime: When $f_u CL_{int} \\ll Q_h$, the denominator $Q_h + f_u CL_{int} \\approx Q_h$. The clearance equation simplifies to $CL_h \\approx \\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{Q_h} = f_u CL_{int}$. In this regime, hepatic clearance is limited by the enzymatic capacity and is directly sensitive to changes in both intrinsic clearance and the unbound fraction. Compound A, with $CL_{int,A} = 5$, operates in this regime (e.g., initially, $f_u CL_{int,A} = 0.25$, which is much less than $Q_h = 20$). Therefore, increasing $f_u$ from $0.05$ to $0.20$ (a $4$-fold increase) causes a substantial, near-proportional increase in its clearance ($F_A = 27/7 \\approx 3.86$).\n\n2.  High-Extraction Regime: When $f_u CL_{int} \\gg Q_h$, the term $Q_h$ in the denominator becomes negligible, so $Q_h + f_u CL_{int} \\approx f_u CL_{int}$. The clearance equation simplifies to $CL_h \\approx \\frac{Q_h f_u CL_{int}}{f_u CL_{int}} = Q_h$. In this regime, hepatic clearance is limited by the rate of drug delivery to the liver (i.e., blood flow) and becomes largely insensitive to changes in $f_u$ or $CL_{int}$. Compound B, with $CL_{int,B} = 500$, operates in this regime (e.g., initially, $f_u CL_{int,B} = 25$, which is greater than $Q_h = 20$; finally $f_u' CL_{int,B} = 100$, which is much greater). Consequently, a $4$-fold increase in $f_u$ results in only a modest increase in clearance ($F_B = 1.5$) as the system is already approaching its flow-limited maximum.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing $f_u$ increases the hepatic clearance in both regimes, but the effect is far more pronounced for low-extraction compounds than for high-extraction compounds.",
