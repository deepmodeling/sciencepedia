The plasma concentration–time profile after a single dose is sampled in a noncompartmental analysis paradigm. Let $C(t)$ denote the plasma concentration at time $t$, and let area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) be the time integral of $C(t)$ over the specified interval.\n\nNine post-dose samples yield the following observations (time in hours, concentration in $\\mathrm{mg/L}$): at $t = 0$, $0.5$, $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $12$, $24$, $36$ hours, the measured plasma concentrations are $C = 0.00$, $1.80$, $3.60$, $5.20$, $4.90$, $3.80$, $3.10$, $1.50$, $0.75$ $\\mathrm{mg/L}$, respectively.\n\nAssume:\n- The noncompartmental AUC from time $0$ to the last measurable concentration uses the linear trapezoidal rule applied to successive observed points.\n- The terminal elimination phase follows first-order kinetics, so that $\\ln C$ versus $t$ is linear in the terminal region.\n- The terminal elimination rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$ is estimated by ordinary least squares linear regression of $\\ln C$ on $t$ using the last three non-zero concentration–time points ($t = 12$, $24$, $36$ hours).\n- The tail AUC extrapolated to infinity is computed by log-linear extrapolation using $C_{\\text{last}}/k_{\\mathrm{el}}$, where $C_{\\text{last}}$ is the last measured concentration.\n- The total AUC to infinity is $ \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\infty} = \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{last}} + \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{extra}}$, and the extrapolated fraction of AUC is $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{extra}} / \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\infty}$.\n\nCompute the following and provide both quantities as your final answer:\n1.

Estimation of the terminal elimination rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$.\n3. Calculation of the total area under the curve extrapolated to infinity, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\infty}$, and the fraction of the AUC that is extrapolated.\n\nThe provided data consists of $9$ time-concentration pairs $(t_i, C_i)$:\n$(0, 0.00)$, $(0.5, 1.80)$, $(1, 3.60)$, $(2, 5.20)$, $(4, 4.90)$, $(8, 3.80)$, $(12, 3.10)$, $(24, 1.50)$, $(36, 0.75)$.\nThe units for time $t$ are hours ($\\mathrm{h}$) and for concentration $C$ are milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{last}}$, which is the AUC from $t=0$ to $t=36\\ \\mathrm{h}$, using the linear trapezoidal rule. The area of a trapezoid between two consecutive time points $(t_i, C_i)$ and $(t_{i+1}, C_{i+1})$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{i \\to i+1} = \\frac{C_i + C_{i+1}}{2} (t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\nWe sum the areas of the individual trapezoids:\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{0 \\to 0.5} = \\frac{0.00 + 1.80}{2} (0.5 - 0) = 0.90 \\times 0.5 = 0.45 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{0.5 \\to 1} = \\frac{1.80 + 3.60}{2} (1 - 0.5) = 2.70 \\times 0.5 = 1.35 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{1 \\to 2} = \\frac{3.60 + 5.20}{2} (2 - 1) = 4.40 \\times 1 = 4.40 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{2 \\to 4} = \\frac{5.20 + 4.90}{2} (4 - 2) = 5.05 \\times 2 = 10.10 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{4 \\to 8} = \\frac{4.90 + 3.80}{2} (8 - 4) = 4.35 \\times 4 = 17.40 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{8 \\to 12} = \\frac{3.80 + 3.10}{2} (12 - 8) = 3.45 \\times 4 = 13.80 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{12 \\to 24} = \\frac{3.10 + 1.50}{2} (24 - 12) = 2.30 \\times 12 = 27.60 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n$\\mathrm{AUC}_{24 \\to 36} = \\frac{1.50 + 0.75}{2} (36 - 24) = 1.125 \\times 12 = 13.50 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L}$\n\nSumming these individual areas gives $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{last}}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\text{last}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{7} \\mathrm{AUC}_{i \\to i+1} = 0.45 + 1.35 + 4.40 + 10.10 + 17.40 + 13.80 + 27.60 + 13.50 = 88.60 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\cdot h/L} $$\n\nSecond, we calculate the terminal elimination rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{el}}$. This is done by performing an ordinary least squares linear regression on the natural logarithm of concentration, $\\ln(C)$, versus time, $t$, for the last three non-zero concentration data points. The model for first-order elimination is $C(t) = C(t_0) \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{el}}(t-t_0))$, which linearizes to $\\ln(C(t)) = \\ln(C(t_0)) - k_{\\mathrm{el}}(t-t_0)$. The slope of the regression of $\\ln(C)$ on $t$ is equal to $-k_{\\mathrm{el}}$.\n\nThe points for regression are $(12, 3.10)$, $(24, 1.50)$, and $(36, 0.75)$. Let the time points be $t_1=12$, $t_2=24$, $t_3=36$, and the corresponding log-concentrations be $y_1=\\ln(3.10)$, $y_2=\\ln(1.50)$, and $y_3=\\ln(0.75)$.\n\nThe slope $m$ of the regression line is given by the formula:\n$$ m = \\frac{n \\sum(t_i y_i) - (\\sum t_i)(\\sum y_i)}{n \\sum(t_i^2) - (\\sum t_i)^2} $$\nwhere $n=3$. The time points are equally spaced with an interval $\\Delta t = 12$. For $3$ equally spaced points, the formula for the slope simplifies.

The relationship between the variables is defined by the principles of mass balance. The inclusion of the dosing interval $\\tau$ while the target is given as $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau, \\mathrm{target}}$ is consistent, as the fundamental relationship derived from mass balance over that interval is independent of the interval's specific length.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms.

I will proceed to solve it.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe derivation is based on the principle of mass balance at steady state. For a multiple-dosing regimen, steady state is achieved when the rate of drug administration is equal to the rate of drug elimination. Equivalently, over one complete dosing interval, $\\tau$, the amount of drug that enters the systemic circulation must equal the amount of drug that is eliminated from the body.\n\n1.  **Amount of Drug Entering Systemic Circulation:**\n    An oral dose, denoted as $\\mathrm{Dose}$, is administered. The absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, is the fraction of this dose that reaches the systemic circulation in its active form. Therefore, the amount of drug that becomes systemically available from a single dose is:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Absorbed} = F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} $$\n\n2.  **Amount of Drug Eliminated from the Body:**\n    The problem states that the derivation should use the definition of clearance, $\\mathrm{CL}$. Systemic clearance is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of the drug per unit time. The rate of elimination of a drug from the body at any time $t$ is proportional to its plasma concentration $C(t)$:\n    $$ \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C(t) $$\n    To find the total amount of drug eliminated over one dosing interval at steady state, from time $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$, we must integrate the rate of elimination over this interval. Let $C_{ss}(t)$ represent the plasma concentration at time $t$ during the dosing interval at steady state.\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\text{Rate of Elimination}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\n    Since the problem states that systemic clearance $\\mathrm{CL}$ is constant, we can move it outside the integral:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt $$\n    The integral term, $\\int_{0}^{\\tau} C_{ss}(t) \\, dt$, is by definition the area under the plasma concentration–time curve over one dosing interval at steady state, denoted as $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$.\n    Therefore, the amount eliminated over one dosing interval is:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Eliminated} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} $$\n\n3.  **Applying the Mass Balance Principle:**\n    At steady state, the amount absorbed equals the amount eliminated over one dosing interval:\n    $$ \\text{Amount Absorbed} = \\text{Amount Eliminated} $$\n    Substituting the expressions derived above:\n    $$ F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss} $$\n\n4.  **Solving for the Maintenance Dose:**\n    The clinical objective is to achieve a target exposure, $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}}$. We set $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,ss}$ to this target value.\n    $$ F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose} = \\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}} $$\n    Solving for the required maintenance dose, $\\mathrm{Dose}$:\n    $$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{\\mathrm{CL} \\cdot \\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}}}{F} $$\n    This is the derived expression for the maintenance dose.\n\n**Step 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the derived formula.\n-   $\\mathrm{CL} = 11.5\\,\\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}$\n-   $\\mathrm{AUC}_{\\tau,\\mathrm{target}} = 62\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$\n-   $F = 0.46$ (dimensionless)\n\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{(11.5\\,\\mathrm{L \\cdot h^{-1}}) \\cdot (62\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}})}{0.46} $$\nFirst, we verify the units of the resulting dose:\n$$ \\frac{(\\mathrm{L} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h} \\cdot \\mathrm{L}^{-1})}{\\text{dimensionless}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{h}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{L}} = \\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe units are correct.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{11.5 \\cdot 62}{0.46} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = \\frac{713}{0.46} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Dose} = 1550\\,\\mathrm{mg} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1550$. When written as $1550$, it has three or four significant figures. Writing it as 1550. would be four. The solution does not contain a decimal.

The compound is well described by a one-compartment disposition model with first-order extravascular absorption and first-order elimination. Let the first-order absorption rate constant be $k_a$ and the first-order elimination rate constant be $k_e$. Immediate-release (IR), extended-release (ER), and microencapsulated (ME) oral formulations are designed to modulate $k_a$ while maintaining identical dose and similar absolute bioavailability $F$ within the studied range. Intravenous dosing is used to estimate disposition parameters unaffected by absorption.\n\nIn a crossover study in healthy participants, the following semilog terminal slopes (on log concentration versus time) are observed for the same dose:\n\n- Intravenous: terminal slope $-0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Oral IR: terminal slope $-0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Oral ER: terminal slope $-0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Oral ME: terminal slope $-0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nIn a second period, participants receive a strong CYP3A inhibitor. The intravenous terminal slope becomes $-0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. Under the inhibitor, the observed oral terminal slopes are:\n\n- Oral IR: terminal slope $-0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Oral ER: terminal slope $-0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Oral ME: terminal slope $-0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nAssume linear pharmacokinetics and no saturation of absorption or elimination in the dose range studied. Based on first principles of absorption–distribution–metabolism–excretion (ADME) and the one-compartment, first-order absorption–elimination structure, select all statements that correctly justify when flip-flop kinetics occur and how to diagnose them from the terminal phase dependence on formulation-controlled absorption rate:\n\nA. In a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, flip-flop kinetics occur when $k_a  k_e$; with such formulations, the terminal log-linear slope after oral dosing equals $-k_a$ and therefore is sensitive to formulation-controlled changes in $k_a$ but insensitive to changes in $k_e$ as long as $k_a$ remains less than $k_e$.\n\nB. The presence of equal oral and intravenous terminal slopes automatically implies flip-flop kinetics; thus the immediate-release formulation above exhibits flip-flop.\n\nC. To diagnose flip-flop, compare oral terminal slopes across formulations and with the intravenous terminal slope; if slowing absorption increases the oral terminal half-life beyond the intravenous half-life, and a pharmacokinetic perturbation that reduces $k_e$ fails to change the oral terminal slope for the slow-absorbing formulations, then absorption controls the terminal phase.\n\nD. Flip-flop is fundamentally a consequence of low absolute bioavailability $F$; increasing $F$ from $0.3$ to $0.9$ would switch the terminal slope from $-k_a$ to $-k_e$ without any change in $k_a$ or $k_e$.\n\nE. In the example, the extended-release and microencapsulated formulations exhibit flip-flop both before and after cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibition, because their estimated $k_a$ values are approximately $0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, which are less than the elimination rate constants under both conditions; the immediate-release formulation does not exhibit flip-flop.",

The question is clear and requires the application of first principles to a given dataset.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. The data are numerical, and the assumptions are explicitly stated.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\n\nFor a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, the plasma concentration $C(t)$ after an oral dose $D$ is given by the function:\n$$ C(t) = \\frac{F D k_a}{V(k_a - k_e)} (e^{-k_e t} - e^{-k_a t}) $$\nwhere $F$ is bioavailability, $V$ is the volume of distribution, $k_a$ is the absorption rate constant, and $k_e$ is the elimination rate constant. The formula is written assuming $k_a \\neq k_e$.\n\nThe terminal phase of the log-concentration versus time plot is determined by the slower of the two exponential decay processes, i.e., the one with the smaller rate constant. The magnitude of the terminal slope, denoted $\\lambda_z$, is equal to this smaller rate constant.\n\n- **Case 1: Regular Kinetics ($k_a  k_e$)**\n  If absorption is faster than elimination, the term $e^{-k_a t}$ decays more rapidly than $e^{-k_e t}$. At late time points, the concentration is approximated by $C(t) \\approx A \\cdot e^{-k_e t}$, where $A$ is a constant. The terminal log-linear slope is $-\\lambda_z = -k_e$. The apparent terminal half-life is $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_e$.\n\n- **Case 2: Flip-Flop Kinetics ($k_a  k_e$)**\n  If absorption is slower than elimination (e.g., in an extended-release formulation), the term $e^{-k_e t}$ decays more rapidly than $e^{-k_a t}$. At late time points, the concentration is approximated by $C(t) \\approx B \\cdot e^{-k_a t}$, where $B$ is a constant. This is termed \"flip-flop\" kinetics because the terminal phase is rate-limited by absorption, not elimination. The terminal log-linear slope is $-\\lambda_z = -k_a$. The apparent terminal half-life is $t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_a$.\n\n- **Intravenous (IV) Administration:**\n  An IV bolus dose places the drug directly into the central compartment, bypassing absorption. The concentration profile is $C(t) = (D/V) \\cdot e^{-k_e t}$. The terminal slope is unequivocally $-k_e$. Therefore, the IV terminal slope serves as the gold standard for determining the true elimination rate constant $k_e$.\n\n### Analysis of Experimental Data\n1.  **Baseline Condition:**\n    - The IV terminal slope is $-0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This directly yields the baseline elimination rate constant: $k_{e, \\text{base}} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n    - Oral IR: Terminal slope is $-0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, which matches $-k_{e, \\text{base}}$. This indicates regular kinetics, so $k_{a, \\text{IR}}  k_{e, \\text{base}}$, i.e., $k_{a, \\text{IR}}  0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n    - Oral ER: Terminal slope is $-0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This does not match $-k_{e, \\text{base}}$. This implies flip-flop kinetics, where the terminal slope equals $-k_a$. Thus, $k_{a, \\text{ER}} \\approx 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The condition for flip-flop, $k_a  k_e$, is met: $0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n    - Oral ME: Terminal slope is $-0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This also indicates flip-flop kinetics. Thus, $k_{a, \\text{ME}} \\approx 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The condition $k_a  k_e$ is met: $0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\n2.  **With CYP3A Inhibitor:**\n    - The inhibitor reduces metabolic clearance, thus reducing $k_e$.\n    - The new IV terminal slope is $-0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This yields the new elimination rate constant: $k_{e, \\text{inhib}} = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n    - Oral IR: Terminal slope is $-0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, which matches $-k_{e, \\text{inhib}}$. This is still regular kinetics ($k_a  k_e$), consistent with $k_{a, \\text{IR}}  0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The terminal slope correctly reflects the change in elimination.\n    - Oral ER: Terminal slope is unchanged at $-0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This slope is determined by $k_{a, \\text{ER}} \\approx 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The condition for flip-flop, $k_a  k_e$, is still met: $0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The terminal phase remains absorption-rate-limited and is therefore insensitive to the change in $k_e$.\n    - Oral ME: Terminal slope is unchanged at $-0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. This slope is determined by $k_{a, \\text{ME}} \\approx 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The condition for flip-flop, $k_a  k_e$, is still met: $0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}  0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. The terminal phase is also insensitive to the change in $k_e$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, flip-flop kinetics occur when $k_a  k_e$; with such formulations, the terminal log-linear slope after oral dosing equals $-k_a$ and therefore is sensitive to formulation-controlled changes in $k_a$ but insensitive to changes in $k_e$ as long as $k_a$ remains less than $k_e$.**\nThis statement accurately describes flip-flop kinetics.\n- The condition is correctly stated as $k_a  k_e$.\n- The consequence that the terminal slope is $-k_a$ is correct.\n- The sensitivity to $k_a$ is correct; changing the formulation from ER ($k_a \\approx 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$) to ME ($k_a \\approx 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$) changed the slope.\n- The insensitivity to $k_e$ (provided $k_a  k_e$ holds) is also correct, as demonstrated by the inhibitor experiment where $k_e$ changed but the ER and ME slopes did not.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The presence of equal oral and intravenous terminal slopes automatically implies flip-flop kinetics; thus the immediate-release formulation above exhibits flip-flop.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Equal oral and IV terminal slopes imply that the oral terminal slope is equal to $-k_e$, which is the defining characteristic of *regular* (non-flip-flop) kinetics, where $k_a  k_e$. The immediate-release formulation shows this behavior and therefore does *not* exhibit flip-flop kinetics.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. To diagnose flip-flop, compare oral terminal slopes across formulations and with the intravenous terminal slope; if slowing absorption increases the oral terminal half-life beyond the intravenous half-life, and a pharmacokinetic perturbation that reduces $k_e$ fails to change the oral terminal slope for the slow-absorbing formulations, then absorption controls the terminal phase.**\nThis statement describes a rigorous experimental strategy for diagnosing flip-flop kinetics.\n- Comparing oral and IV slopes is the primary method.\n- If $k_a  k_e$, then the oral terminal half-life ($t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_a$) will be longer than the IV half-life ($t_{1/2} = \\ln(2)/k_e$). This is observed in the data for ER and ME.\n- A perturbation that changes $k_e$ (like the inhibitor) but does not change the oral terminal slope for the slow-absorbing formulations provides definitive confirmation that the slope is determined by $k_a$. This is also precisely what was observed for ER and ME.\nThe entire statement is a valid description of the diagnostic process.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Flip-flop is fundamentally a consequence of low absolute bioavailability $F$; increasing $F$ from $0.3$ to $0.9$ would switch the terminal slope from $-k_a$ to $-k_e$ without any change in $k_a$ or $k_e$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The condition for flip-flop kinetics is $k_a  k_e$. The bioavailability, $F$, is a pre-exponential scaling factor and does not influence the rate constants themselves. Altering $F$ changes the magnitude of the plasma concentration (and thus the AUC) but does not alter the underlying time course governed by the exponential terms $e^{-k_a t}$ and $e^{-k_e t}$. Therefore, changing $F$ cannot switch the system from flip-flop to regular kinetics or vice-versa.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. In the example, the extended-release and microencapsulated formulations exhibit flip-flop both before and after cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibition, because their estimated $k_a$ values are approximately $0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$, which are less than the elimination rate constants under both conditions; the immediate-release formulation does not exhibit flip-flop.**\nThis statement is a correct application of the principles to the provided data.\n- The ER and ME formulations do exhibit flip-flop under both conditions, as their terminal slopes differ from the corresponding IV slopes.\n- The estimated $k_a$ values from their slopes are indeed $\\approx 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $\\approx 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- These $k_a$ values are less than both elimination rate constants ($k_{e, \\text{base}} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ and $k_{e, \\text{inhib}} = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$). This confirms the flip-flop condition holds throughout.\n- The IR formulation, whose oral slope tracks the IV slope, correctly does not exhibit flip-flop kinetics. The statement is a complete and accurate summary.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
