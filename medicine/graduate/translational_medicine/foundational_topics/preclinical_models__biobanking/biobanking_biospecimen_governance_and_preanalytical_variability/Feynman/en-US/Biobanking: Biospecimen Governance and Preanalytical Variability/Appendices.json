            "problem": "A national translational medicine consortium biobank enforces a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) requiring documentation of all freeze-thaw events to minimize preanalytical variability for downstream assays. Consider a plasma biospecimen intended for an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Immediately following the initial processing and aliquoting, the concentration of a target cytokine is measured as $C_0 = 125$ ng/mL. During distribution and secondary aliquoting, the sample will undergo $n = 4$ freeze-thaw cycles. Empirical validation studies at the biobank indicate that each freeze-thaw cycle causes a constant fractional loss $\\alpha = 0.05$ of the analyte present at the start of that cycle, attributable to first-order denaturation processes under these handling conditions. Assume no additional degradation during cold storage between cycles and no volume change or dilution.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that a constant fractional loss per cycle implies that the loss during a cycle is proportional to the analyte amount present at the beginning of that cycle, derive the expression for the analyte concentration $C_n$ after $n$ cycles in terms of $C_0$, $\\alpha$, and $n$. Then use this expression to compute the predicted concentration after $n = 4$ cycles for $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $C_0 = 125$ ng/mL.\n\nRound your final numeric answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard first-order discrete decay process, a common model for analyte degradation due to physical stressors like freeze-thaw cycles in a biobanking context. All necessary parameters are provided, and the problem is free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving a general expression for the analyte concentration $C_n$ after $n$ freeze-thaw cycles and then calculating its specific value.\n\nLet $C_k$ represent the concentration of the target cytokine after $k$ cycles. The initial concentration, before any freeze-thaw cycles, is given as $C_0$.\nThe problem states that each cycle induces a constant fractional loss, $\\alpha$, of the analyte present at the beginning of that cycle. This can be expressed mathematically.\n\nFor the first cycle ($k=1$):\nThe concentration at the start of the cycle is $C_0$.\nThe amount of analyte lost during this cycle is proportional to the starting concentration: $\\text{Loss}_1 = \\alpha C_0$.\nThe concentration remaining at the end of the first cycle, $C_1$, is the initial concentration minus the loss:\n$$C_1 = C_0 - \\alpha C_0$$\n$$C_1 = C_0 (1 - \\alpha)$$\n\nFor the second cycle ($k=2$):\nThe concentration at the start of this cycle is $C_1$.\nThe amount of analyte lost during the second cycle is $\\text{Loss}_2 = \\alpha C_1$.\nThe concentration remaining at the end of the second cycle, $C_2$, is:\n$$C_2 = C_1 - \\alpha C_1$$\n$$C_2 = C_1 (1 - \\alpha)$$\nWe can substitute the expression for $C_1$ from the previous step:\n$$C_2 = (C_0 (1 - \\alpha)) (1 - \\alpha)$$\n$$C_2 = C_0 (1 - \\alpha)^2$$\n\nFor the third cycle ($k=3$):\nThe concentration at the start of this cycle is $C_2$.\nThe amount of analyte lost is $\\text{Loss}_3 = \\alpha C_2$.\nThe concentration remaining at the end of the third cycle, $C_3$, is:\n$$C_3 = C_2 - \\alpha C_2 = C_2 (1 - \\alpha)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_2$:\n$$C_3 = (C_0 (1 - \\alpha)^2) (1 - \\alpha)$$\n$$C_3 = C_0 (1 - \\alpha)^3$$\n\nBy observing the pattern, we can generalize this relationship using mathematical induction. The concentration $C_n$ after $n$ cycles follows a geometric progression:\n$$C_n = C_0 (1 - \\alpha)^n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the analyte concentration after $n$ cycles.\n\nNow, we must use this expression to compute the predicted concentration for the given parameters:\nInitial concentration: $C_0 = 125$\nNumber of cycles: $n = 4$\nFractional loss per cycle: $\\alpha = 0.05$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$C_4 = 125 \\times (1 - 0.05)^4$$\n$$C_4 = 125 \\times (0.95)^4$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $(0.95)^4$:\n$$(0.95)^4 = 0.81450625$$\n\nNext, we multiply this by the initial concentration $C_0$:\n$$C_4 = 125 \\times 0.81450625$$\n$$C_4 = 101.81328125$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $101.81328125...$. The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $1$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $1$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe final concentration, rounded to four significant figures, is $101.8$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quality and risk management, specifically Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), which is a standard methodology applied in fields like engineering, healthcare, and biobanking. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary data to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe core task is to apply the standard FMEA protocol to identify the highest-priority risk among three specified failure modes in a biobanking context. The prioritization is based on the calculation of the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each failure mode.\n\nThe RPN is a quantitative measure used in FMEA to rank risks. It is calculated as the product of three scores: Severity ($S$), Occurrence ($O$), and Detection ($D$).\nThe governing equation is:\n$$\nRPN = S \\times O \\times D\n$$\nwhere:\n- $S$ (Severity) is a score representing the seriousness of the consequences of the failure.\n- $O$ (Occurrence) is a score representing the probability or frequency of the failure occurring.\n- $D$ (Detection) is a score representing the probability of the failure not being detected before it has an effect. A higher score indicates a lower chance of detection.\n\nWe are given the scores for three distinct failure modes:\n\n1.  **Failure Mode A**: Delayed plasma separation.\n    The scores are $S_A = 7$, $O_A = 4$, and $D_A = 5$.\n    The RPN for this failure mode, $RPN_A$, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    RPN_A = S_A \\times O_A \\times D_A = 7 \\times 4 \\times 5 = 140\n    $$\n\n2.  **Failure Mode B**: Misclassification of IRB consent.\n    The scores are $S_B = 9$, $O_B = 2$, and $D_B = 6$.\n    The RPN for this failure mode, $RPN_B$, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    RPN_B = S_B \\times O_B \\times D_B = 9 \\times 2 \\times 6 = 108\n    $$\n\n3.  **Failure Mode C**: Transient ambient temperature excursions.\n    The scores are $S_C = 5$, $O_C = 8$, and $D_C = 3$.\n    The RPN for this failure mode, $RPN_C$, is calculated as:\n    $$\n    RPN_C = S_C \\times O_C \\times D_C = 5 \\times 8 \\times 3 = 120\n    $$\n\nTo determine which failure mode should be prioritized for immediate mitigation, we compare the calculated RPN values.
