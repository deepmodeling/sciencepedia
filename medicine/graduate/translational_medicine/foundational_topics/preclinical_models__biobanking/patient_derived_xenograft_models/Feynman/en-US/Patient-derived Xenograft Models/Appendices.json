To translate a clinically used human dose to a mouse-equivalent regimen that targets comparable systemic exposure, you adopt the following foundational pharmacokinetic assumptions: linear pharmacokinetics, identical route of administration with complete bioavailability across species, and an allometric relationship for systemic clearance such that $CL = k\\,W^{\\beta}$, where $CL$ is systemic clearance, $W$ is body weight, $k$ is a species-independent proportionality constant, and $\\beta$ is the allometric exponent. The pharmacologically relevant exposure metric is the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), with $AUC \\propto \\dfrac{\\text{Dose}}{CL}$. The administered dose is expressed on a per kilogram basis, so that the absolute dose is $\\text{Dose} = d\\,W$, where $d$ has units $\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\n\nStarting only from these fundamentals, derive the interspecies mg/kg scaling relation of the form $d_{\\mathrm{mouse}} = d_{\\mathrm{human}}\\left(\\dfrac{W_{\\mathrm{mouse}}}{W_{\\mathrm{human}}}\\right)^{\\theta}$, expressing the exponent $\\theta$ in terms of the clearance exponent $\\beta$.

Explain, based on your derivation, the correct interpretation of TGI when baseline volumes differ between cohorts, and why endpoint volumes alone are not an appropriate basis for comparison in such cases. Express the final TGI value as a decimal, rounded to four significant figures, with no percent sign.",
            "solution": "The core task is to derive a dimensionless measure for Tumor Growth Inhibition (TGI) that compares the effect of a drug treatment to a control condition. The problem specifies that this measure should compare the \"drug-induced change in tumor volume to the change that would be observed in the absence of treatment.\" This directive constitutes the first principle for our derivation.\n\nLet $V_{\\mathrm{control}}(t)$ and $V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(t)$ represent the average tumor volumes at time $t$ for the control and treated cohorts, respectively. The experiment is observed from a baseline time $t=0$ to an endpoint time $t^{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we define the change in tumor volume, or tumor growth, over the experimental period $[0, t^{\\ast}]$ for each cohort.\n\nThe change in volume for the control group is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}} = V_{\\mathrm{control}}(t^{\\ast}) - V_{\\mathrm{control}}(0) $$\nThis quantity, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}$, represents the natural growth of the tumor over the time period $t^{\\ast}$ in the absence of the therapeutic agent.\n\nThe change in volume for the treated group is:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}} = V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(t^{\\ast}) - V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(0) $$\nThis quantity, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}}$, represents the net growth of the tumor under the influence of the drug.\n\nThe \"inhibition\" of growth due to the drug is the difference between the growth that would have occurred (control growth) and the growth that was actually observed (treated growth). We can express this absolute growth inhibition as:\n$$ \\text{Absolute Growth Inhibition} = \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}} $$\nTo create a dimensionless, relative measure as required, we normalize this absolute inhibition by the growth that would have occurred without treatment, which is $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}$. This yields the standard formula for TGI:\n$$ \\text{TGI} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}} - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}} $$\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$ \\text{TGI} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}} $$\nSubstituting the definitions for $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}$ and $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}}$, we arrive at the full expression for TGI based on the measured volumes:\n$$ \\text{TGI} = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(t^{\\ast}) - V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(0)}{V_{\\mathrm{control}}(t^{\\ast}) - V_{\\mathrm{control}}(0)} $$\nThis derived expression is the required dimensionless measure.\n\nThe problem asks for an explanation of the correct interpretation of TGI when baseline volumes differ. The derived formula shows that TGI is not based on the final tumor volumes $V(t^{\\ast})$ alone, but on the *change* in volumes, $\\Delta V$. This is critical. In a typical PDX experiment, even with careful staging, there will be variation in the initial tumor volumes ($V(0)$) between cohorts. If one were to compare only the endpoint volumes, for instance by calculating the ratio $V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(t^{\\ast}) / V_{\\mathrm{control}}(t^{\\ast})$, any pre-existing difference in baseline volumes would confound the interpretation of the drug's effect. For example, if the treated group started with significantly larger tumors, its final volume might still be larger than the control group's final volume, even if the drug were highly effective at slowing growth. This could lead to the erroneous conclusion that the drug is ineffective or even promotes growth. The TGI metric, by focusing on the net change $\\Delta V$, mathematically normalizes for differences in starting volumes. It correctly evaluates the treatment's effect on the *rate of growth* relative to the natural growth rate, which is the biologically and pharmacologically relevant question. Therefore, using endpoint volumes alone is not an appropriate basis for comparison when baseline volumes are unequal because it conflates the treatment effect with initial experimental conditions.\n\nNow, we compute the TGI at $t^{\\ast} = 21$ days using the provided data:\n$V_{\\mathrm{control}}(0) = 105\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{control}}(21) = 315\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(0) = 145\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{treated}}(21) = 210\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the change in volume for each cohort.\nFor the control cohort:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}} = 315\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} - 105\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} = 210\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} $$\nFor the treated cohort:\n$$ \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}} = 210\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} - 145\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} = 65\\,\\mathrm{mm}^{3} $$\nNow, we substitute these values into the TGI formula:\n$$ \\text{TGI} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{treated}}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{control}}} = 1 - \\frac{65}{210} $$\nThe ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{65}{210} \\approx 0.3095238... $$\nTherefore, the TGI is:\n$$ \\text{TGI} = 1 - 0.3095238... = 0.6904761... $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{TGI} \\approx 0.6905 $$\nThis value signifies that the treatment inhibited tumor growth by approximately $69.05\\%$ compared to the growth observed in the control group over the $21$-day period.",
