            "problem": "A patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma has received Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy. Within $48$ hours of infusion, the team monitors for cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity, using circulating biomarkers Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and ferritin, which are known correlates of systemic inflammation. Assume the following well-established bases: (i) for a biomarker $b$ measured relative to a reference median $b_{0}$, a doubling of $b/b_{0}$ increases $\\log_{2}(b/b_{0})$ by $1$; (ii) in a short observation window with rare events, odds ratios approximate hazard ratios; (iii) under a proportional hazards framework, a reported hazard ratio per doubling, $\\mathrm{HR}$, corresponds to an additive increment of $\\ln(\\mathrm{HR})$ in the log-odds for each unit increase of $\\log_{2}(b/b_{0})$; and (iv) a decision index $D$ on $[0,1]$ can be obtained by mapping a linear predictor to a probability using the standard logistic link. The intercept is chosen to satisfy $D=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ when each biomarker equals its reference median.\n\nYou are given the patient’s laboratory values obtained at $t=24$ hours post-infusion: IL-6 $=420\\ \\mathrm{pg/mL}$, CRP $=200\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, ferritin $=2500\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. Use the following reference medians for non-CRS baseline: IL-6 $=10\\ \\mathrm{pg/mL}$, CRP $=5\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, ferritin $=300\\ \\mathrm{ng/mL}$. Published hazard ratios per doubling for progression to grade $\\geq 2$ CRS in this time window are: IL-6 $\\mathrm{HR}=2.7$, CRP $\\mathrm{HR}=1.8$, ferritin $\\mathrm{HR}=1.5$. The clinical protocol initiates anti-IL-6 therapy when the decision index satisfies $D \\geq \\theta$, with $\\theta=0.65$.\n\nStarting only from the bases above, derive the decision index from first principles and compute its value for this patient. Express the decision index $D$ as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures. Do not include any unit in your final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The objective is to derive the decision index $D$ from the provided principles and compute its value for the patient. The decision index is a score between $0$ and $1$ that quantifies the risk of progressing to grade $\\geq 2$ Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS).\n\nFirst, as per basis (iv), the decision index $D$ is related to a linear predictor, $\\eta$, through the standard logistic link function:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta)}$$\nThe linear predictor $\\eta$ is a composite score calculated from the patient's biomarker levels. It is a linear combination of predictor variables, one for each biomarker:\n$$\\eta = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{IL-6} X_{IL-6} + \\beta_{CRP} X_{CRP} + \\beta_{Frt} X_{Frt}$$\nHere, $\\beta_0$ is the intercept, the $\\beta_i$ are the coefficients for each biomarker, and the $X_i$ are the corresponding predictor variables.\n\nBasis (i) defines the predictor variable for a biomarker $b$ with a reference median $b_0$ as $X = \\log_2(b/b_0)$.

At this baseline state, the ratio $b_i/b_{0,i} = 1$, and thus each predictor variable $X_i = \\log_2(1) = 0$.

The clinical task is to adjudicate between bacterial infection and sterile Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). You are asked to compute a composite probabilistic score—defined as the posterior probability of bacterial infection given the available evidence—using first principles of probabilistic inference from an epidemiologic prior and independent likelihood ratios for each observation. Assume conditional independence of the listed features given the diagnostic state. There are no signs of Immune effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome (ICANS) on examination.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- Baseline epidemiology for patients at this time point provides a prior probability of bacterial infection of $0.30$.\n- Independent diagnostic observations and their likelihood ratios in favor of bacterial infection are specified as follows:\n  - Procalcitonin: if $0.5 \\leq \\text{PCT} < 2.0$ $\\text{ng/mL}$, the likelihood ratio is $2.0$.\n  - Serum lactate: if $2.0 \\leq \\text{lactate} < 4.0$ $\\text{mmol/L}$, the likelihood ratio is $1.5$.\n  - Blood cultures: if no growth at $24$ hours with adequate blood volume collected, the likelihood ratio is $0.70$.\n  - Fever curve phenotype: defervescence within $6$ hours after the first dose of interleukin-$6$ receptor antagonist tocilizumab is assigned a likelihood ratio of $0.25$ for bacterial infection.\n\nA specific patient has the following data at the time of evaluation:\n- Procalcitonin $=$ $1.6$ $\\text{ng/mL}$.\n- Serum lactate $=$ $3.1$ $\\text{mmol/L}$.\n- Two sets of peripheral blood cultures with adequate volumes show no growth at $24$ hours.\n- Fever resolves within $4$ hours after the first dose of tocilizumab, without any antibiotic changes.\n\nTask:\n- Compute the composite score defined as the posterior probability of bacterial infection using the provided prior and likelihood ratios under the assumption of conditional independence.\n- Based on the computed posterior probability, the dominant diagnosis would be the hypothesis with posterior probability greater than $0.5$; however, you must report only the posterior probability.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal between $0$ and $1$.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem is an application of Bayes' theorem, which allows for the updating of a belief (the prior probability) in light of new evidence. We can use the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem, which is particularly convenient when multiple pieces of conditionally independent evidence are present.\n\nLet $I$ be the event that the patient has a bacterial infection, and $\\neg I$ be the event that the patient does not have a bacterial infection (in this context, sterile Cytokine Release Syndrome, CRS). The problem provides the prior probability of infection as $P(I) = 0.30$. The prior probability of no infection is therefore $P(\\neg I) = 1 - P(I) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n\nFirst, we convert the prior probability into prior odds. The prior odds in favor of infection are given by the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{prior}} = \\frac{P(I)}{P(\\neg I)} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify the evidence from the patient's data and the corresponding likelihood ratios ($LR$) in favor of bacterial infection. A likelihood ratio is defined as $LR = \\frac{P(\\text{Evidence}|I)}{P(\\text{Evidence}|\\neg I)}$.\n\nThe patient's data and the associated likelihood ratios are:\n1.  Procalcitonin (PCT) is $1.6$ $\\text{ng/mL}$. This falls in the range $0.5 \\leq \\text{PCT} < 2.0$ $\\text{ng/mL}$, for which the likelihood ratio is $LR_1 = 2.0$.\n2.  Serum lactate is $3.1$ $\\text{mmol/L}$. This falls in the range $2.0 \\leq \\text{lactate} < 4.0$ $\\text{mmol/L}$, for which the likelihood ratio is $LR_2 = 1.5$.\n3.  Blood cultures show no growth at $24$ hours. The corresponding likelihood ratio is $LR_3 = 0.70$.\n4.  Fever resolves within $4$ hours of tocilizumab administration. This is within the $6$-hour criterion for defervescence, so the likelihood ratio is $LR_4 = 0.25$.\n\nThe problem states that these diagnostic observations are conditionally independent. This assumption allows us to calculate a single composite likelihood ratio, $LR_{\\text{composite}}$, by multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{composite}} = LR_1 \\times LR_2 \\times LR_3 \\times LR_4\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nLR_{\\text{composite}} = 2.0 \\times 1.5 \\times 0.70 \\times 0.25 = 0.525\n$$\n\nNow, we can update the prior odds to posterior odds using the composite likelihood ratio. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = LR_{\\text{composite}} \\times \\text{Odds}_{\\text{prior}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = 0.525 \\times \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nTo compute this precisely, we can express $0.525$ as a fraction, $0.525 = \\frac{525}{1000} = \\frac{21}{40}$.\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{21}{40} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3 \\times 7 \\times 3}{40 \\times 7} = \\frac{9}{40}\n$$\nAs a decimal, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}} = 0.225$.\n\nThe final step is to convert the posterior odds back into a probability. The posterior probability of infection, which we will denote as $p_{\\text{posterior}} = P(I|\\text{Evidence})$, is related to the posterior odds by the formula:\n$$\np_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{posterior}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value for the posterior odds:\n$$\np_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{9/40}{1 + 9/40} = \\frac{9/40}{49/40} = \\frac{9}{49}\n$$\nNow, we compute the decimal value:\n$$\np_{\\text{posterior}} = \\frac{9}{49} \\approx 0.1836734...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\np_{\\text{posterior}} \\approx 0.184\n$$\nThis is the composite probabilistic score, representing the posterior probability of bacterial infection given the evidence.",
