First-order decay is a standard and widely accepted model for the initial bulk erosion phase of PLGA scaffolds under specific conditions (e.g., neutral pH, absence of significant autocatalysis). The context of tissue engineering scaffolds is appropriate. The simplification that the mass fraction equals the molar fraction ($f_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.75$) is a modeling assumption. While it deviates from the precise chemical reality—where the mass fraction would be calculated from the molar masses of lactic acid ($\\approx 90.08\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$) and glycolic acid ($\\approx 76.05\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$), yielding $f_L \\approx 0.78$—it is explicitly stated as a condition of the problem. Such simplifications are common in theoretical modeling to isolate and test understanding of a core principle, in this case, first-order kinetics. It does not violate a fundamental law but rather defines the parameters of the specific model to be solved.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective and all necessary data ($m(0)$, $k$, $f_{\\mathrm{L}}$, and the target time $t$) to calculate a unique solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a standard exercise in applying first-order reaction kinetics to a relevant problem in translational medicine. The simplifying assumption regarding mass fraction does not invalidate the problem but rather is an explicit part of its definition. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe degradation of the scaffold's mass, $m(t)$, is described by first-order kinetics. The governing ordinary differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dm(t)}{dt} = -k \\cdot m(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant. This is a separable differential equation. With the initial condition $m(t=0) = m_0$, we integrate as follows:\n$$\n\\int_{m_0}^{m(t)} \\frac{1}{m} \\, dm = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(m(t)) - \\ln(m_0) = -kt\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{m(t)}{m_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\nSolving for $m(t)$ yields the exponential decay function:\n$$\nm(t) = m_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Time to $50\\%$ mass loss ($t_{1/2}$)**\nThe time to $50\\%$ mass loss is the half-life of the degradation process, denoted as $t_{1/2}$. This is the time at which the mass has been reduced to half of its initial value, i.e., $m(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}m_0$. Substituting this into the decay equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} m_0 = m_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nDividing by $m_0$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})\n$$\nTo solve for $t_{1/2}$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$:\n$$\n-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}\n$$\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given value for the rate constant, $k = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.02} \\,\\mathrm{days} \\approx \\frac{0.693147...}{0.02} \\,\\mathrm{days} \\approx 34.65735... \\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time to $50\\%$ mass loss is $34.66\\,\\mathrm{days}$.\n\n**Part 2: Instantaneous lactic acid generation rate at $t = 10\\,\\mathrm{days}$**\nThe instantaneous rate of total mass loss at any time $t$ is given by the magnitude of the derivative $\\frac{dm(t)}{dt}$:\n$$ \\text{Rate of mass loss} = \\left|\\frac{dm(t)}{dt}\\right| = \\left|-k \\cdot m(t)\\right| = k \\cdot m(t) = k \\cdot m_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nThe problem states that the scaffold degrades into soluble monomers and that the lactic acid fraction by mass is $f_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.75$. Therefore, the instantaneous rate of lactic acid (LA) generation, $R_{\\mathrm{LA}}(t)$, is $f_{\\mathrm{L}}$ times the total rate of mass loss.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LA}}(t) = f_{\\mathrm{L}} \\cdot \\left(k \\cdot m_0 \\exp(-kt)\\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate this rate at $t = 10\\,\\mathrm{days}$. We are given $m_0 = 200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $k = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}$, and $f_{\\mathrm{L}} = 0.75$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LA}}(10) = (0.75) \\cdot (0.02\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}) \\cdot (200\\,\\mathrm{mg}) \\cdot \\exp(-(0.02\\,\\mathrm{day^{-1}}) \\cdot (10\\,\\mathrm{days}))\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LA}}(10) = (0.75 \\cdot 0.02 \\cdot 200) \\cdot \\exp(-0.2) \\,\\mathrm{mg/day}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LA}}(10) = 3 \\cdot \\exp(-0.2) \\,\\mathrm{mg/day}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{LA}}(10) \\approx 3 \\cdot 0.81873075... \\,\\mathrm{mg/day} \\approx 2.4561922... \\,\\mathrm{mg/day}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the instantaneous lactic acid generation rate at $t=10\\,\\mathrm{days}$ is $2.456\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\nThe two requested values are the time to $50\\%$ mass loss ($34.66\\,\\mathrm{days}$) and the lactic acid generation rate at $10\\,\\mathrm{days}$ ($2.456\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$).",

The values for physical parameters are realistic for biological tissue.\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and well-posed. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Step 2: Derivation of the Governing Equation**\nThe conservation of mass for oxygen concentration $c$ at steady state with a volumetric consumption rate $M$ is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = -M $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{J}$ is the molar flux density. The flux is related to the partial pressure gradient by the provided relation $\\mathbf{J} = -K \\nabla P$, where the permeability $K$ is the product of the diffusion coefficient $D$ and the solubility $\\alpha$, i.e., $K = D \\alpha$. Substituting the flux expression into the conservation equation gives:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (-K \\nabla P) = -M $$\nAssuming $K$ is constant, this simplifies to Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 P = \\frac{M}{K} $$\nGiven the radial symmetry of the Krogh cylinder, the pressure $P$ is a function of only the radial coordinate $r$, so $P = P(r)$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2$ in cylindrical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left(r \\frac{dP}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{M}{K} $$\nThis is the governing steady-state radial differential equation for the oxygen partial pressure $P(r)$.\n\n**Step 3: Solution of the Governing Equation**\nWe solve the ordinary differential equation by integrating twice with respect to $r$.\nFirst integration:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left(r \\frac{dP}{dr}\\right) = \\frac{M}{K} r $$\n$$ \\int d\\left(r \\frac{dP}{dr}\\right) = \\int \\frac{M}{K} r \\, dr $$\n$$ r \\frac{dP}{dr} = \\frac{M}{2K} r^2 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is an integration constant.

Zero flux at the outer boundary $r=R$: $\\frac{dP}{dr}\\big|_{r=R} = 0$.\nApplying this to the gradient equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{M}{2K} R + \\frac{C_1}{R} \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{M R^2}{2K} $$\n2. Constant pressure at the capillary wall $r=a$: $P(a) = P_a$.\nSubstituting the expression for $C_1$ into the solution for $P(r)$:\n$$ P(r) = \\frac{M}{4K} r^2 - \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln(r) + C_2 $$\nApplying the condition at $r=a$:\n$$ P_a = \\frac{M}{4K} a^2 - \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln(a) + C_2 $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = P_a - \\frac{M a^2}{4K} + \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln(a) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution gives the final expression for the pressure profile $P(r)$:\n$$ P(r) = \\left(\\frac{M}{4K} r^2 - \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln(r)\\right) + \\left(P_a - \\frac{M a^2}{4K} + \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln(a)\\right) $$\n$$ P(r) = P_a + \\frac{M}{4K}(r^2 - a^2) - \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right) $$\n\n**Step 5: Calculation of the Maximum Intercapillary Distance**\nThe maximum allowable intercapillary distance $L_{\\max} = 2R_{\\max}$ is determined by the condition that the minimum pressure in the tissue, which occurs at $r=R$, must be equal to $P_{\\min}$. So, we set $P(R) = P_{\\min}$ and solve for $R$.\n$$ P_{\\min} = P_a + \\frac{M}{4K}(R^2 - a^2) - \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) $$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $R$:\n$$ P_a - P_{\\min} = \\frac{M R^2}{2K} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) - \\frac{M}{4K}(R^2 - a^2) $$\n$$ P_a - P_{\\min} = \\frac{M}{4K} \\left[ 2R^2 \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) - (R^2 - a^2) \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{4K(P_a - P_{\\min})}{M} = R^2 \\left(2\\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) - 1\\right) + a^2 $$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $R$.

Each element corresponds to one test case and is a list with three floats: $[s^\\star, L^\\star, \\mathrm{RMSE}]$, where $s^\\star$ is in kPa (rounded to two decimal places), $L^\\star$ is in $\\text{pmol/cm}^2$ (rounded to two decimal places), and $\\mathrm{RMSE}$ is in $\\text{cells/mm}^2$ (rounded to two decimal places). For example:\n$[[12.00,150.00,5.43],[\\dots],[\\dots]]$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the development of a computational methodology to optimize a biological response, adherent cell density $A$ (in $\\text{cells/mm}^2$), as a function of two experimental factors: hydrogel stiffness $s$ (in $\\mathrm{kPa}$) and ligand density $L$ (in $\\text{pmol/cm}^2$). This is a classic application of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) within the field of biomaterials engineering. The solution involves a sequence of well-defined steps: experimental design, model fitting, optimization, and validation.\n\nFirst, a robust experimental design must be constructed. The problem specifies a Face-Centered Central Composite Design (FCCD) for two factors. In coded coordinates, where factors are scaled to a $[-1, 1]$ interval, this design consists of $N=9$ points:\n-   Four factorial points at the corners of the design space: $(-1, -1)$, $(1, -1)$, $(-1, 1)$, and $(1, 1)$.\n-   Four axial points located at the center of each face of the design space: $(-1, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(0, -1)$, and $(0, 1)$.\n-   One center point: $(0, 0)$.\n\nThese coded coordinates, let's denote them as $(x_s, x_L)$, are mapped to their physical units $(s, L)$ using a linear transformation based on the specified lower and upper bounds for each factor, $[s_{min}, s_{max}]$ and $[L_{min}, L_{max}]$. The transformation for stiffness $s$ is given by $s = s_{center} + x_s \\cdot s_{span}$, where $s_{center} = (s_{max} + s_{min})/2$ and $s_{span} = (s_{max} - s_{min})/2$. A similar transformation applies to the ligand density $L$. This mapping ensures that the experimental points are appropriately distributed across the region of interest. For each of these $9$ physical points $(s_i, L_i)$, a synthetic response value $A_i$ is generated using the provided case-specific functions.\n\nSecond, a mathematical model is fitted to the experimental data. The problem specifies a second-order polynomial model, which is a common choice for RSM as it can approximate curvature in the response surface. The model has the form:\n$$\n\\hat{A}(s,L) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 s + \\beta_2 L + \\beta_{11} s^2 + \\beta_{22} L^2 + \\beta_{12} sL\n$$\nThe six coefficients, $\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\beta_{11}, \\beta_{22}, \\beta_{12}$, are estimated using the method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). This involves setting up a design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ and a response vector $\\mathbf{y}$. Each row $i$ of $\\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to an experimental point $(s_i, L_i)$ and contains the model terms $[1, s_i, L_i, s_i^2, L_i^2, s_i L_i]$. The response vector $\\mathbf{y}$ contains the observed adhesion values $[A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_9]^T$. The vector of coefficients $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = [\\beta_0, \\dots, \\beta_{12}]^T$ is then calculated by solving the normal equations $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$. A robust numerical method, such as one based on singular value decomposition, is typically used to compute the solution $\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$.\n\nThird, the fitted model $\\hat{A}(s,L)$ is used to find the optimal factor settings $(s^\\star, L^\\star)$ that maximize cell adhesion. The optimization begins by searching for an interior maximum. This is done by finding the stationary point of the response surface, where the gradient is zero: $\\nabla \\hat{A}(s,L) = [0, 0]^T$. The gradient components are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{A}}{\\partial s} = \\beta_1 + 2\\beta_{11}s + \\beta_{12}L = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial \\hat{A}}{\\partial L} = \\beta_2 + 2\\beta_{22}L + \\beta_{12}s = 0\n$$\nThis forms a $2 \\times 2$ linear system for $(s, L)$, which can be readily solved. For this stationary point to be a valid interior maximum, two conditions must be met:\n1.  **Feasibility**: The point $(s^\\star, L^\\star)$ must lie within the experimental domain: $$ s_{min} \\le s^\\star \\le s_{max} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad L_{min} \\le L^\\star \\le L_{max} $$\n2.  **Concavity**: The surface must be curved downwards at this point, which is confirmed by checking if the Hessian matrix $\\mathbf{H}$ is negative definite.\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{H} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{A}}{\\partial s^2} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{A}}{\\partial s \\partial L} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{A}}{\\partial L \\partial s} & \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{A}}{\\partial L^2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2\\beta_{11} & \\beta_{12} \\\\ \\beta_{12} & 2\\beta_{22} \\end{bmatrix}\n    $$\n    Negative definiteness requires $2\\beta_{11}  0$ and $\\det(\\mathbf{H}) = 4\\beta_{11}\\beta_{22} - \\beta_{12}^2 > 0$.\n\nIf these conditions are not met (e.g., the stationary point is a saddle point or lies outside the bounds), the optimum must be located on the boundary of the rectangular domain. A systematic search of the boundary is then conducted. This involves evaluating $\\hat{A}$ at the four corner points and along the four edge segments. On each edge (e.g., $s = s_{min}$ for $L \\in [L_{min}, L_{max}]$), the model reduces to a one-dimensional quadratic in the other variable. The maximum of this 1D quadratic is found and, if it lies on the segment, it becomes a candidate for the global optimum. The final optimum is the point among all candidates (corners and valid edge maxima) that yields the highest predicted response $\\hat{A}$.\n\nFourth, the predictive quality of the model is assessed using $K$-fold cross-validation. The $N=9$ data points are deterministically partitioned into $K$ folds based on their index (point $i$ goes to fold $i \\pmod K$). For each fold, a new quadratic model is trained using the data from the other $K-1$ folds. This model is then used to predict the responses for the points in the held-out fold. This process is repeated for all $K$ folds, resulting in an out-of-sample prediction for every one of the $N=9$ original data points. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is then computed to quantify the average prediction error:\n$$\n\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left( \\hat{A}_{-f(i)}(s_i,L_i) - A_i \\right)^2 }\n$$\nwhere $f(i)$ is the fold containing point $i$ and $\\hat{A}_{-f(i)}$ is the model trained without that fold. This metric provides an estimate of how well the model would perform on new, unseen data.\n\nThe final output for each test case consists of the optimal factor settings $(s^\\star, L^\\star)$ and the calculated $\\mathrm{RMSE}$, all rounded to two decimal places.",
