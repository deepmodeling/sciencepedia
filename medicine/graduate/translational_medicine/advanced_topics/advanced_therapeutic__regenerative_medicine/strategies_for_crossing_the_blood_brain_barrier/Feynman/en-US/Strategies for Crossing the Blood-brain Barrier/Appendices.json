It is scientifically grounded in the principles of acid-base chemistry and pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no identifiable flaws. I will therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the fraction of a monoprotic weak base that exists in its un-ionized (neutral) form at a given hydrogen ion activity ($pH$) and acid dissociation constant ($pK_a$) of its conjugate acid, and then to evaluate this fraction for the specific values provided.\n\nLet the weak base be denoted by $B$ and its protonated, ionized conjugate acid by $BH^{+}$. The problem states the relevant equilibrium is $B + H^{+} \\rightleftharpoons BH^{+}$. A more precise representation considers the dissociation of the conjugate acid in an aqueous medium:\n$$\nBH^{+} \\rightleftharpoons B + H^{+}\n$$\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$\nK_a = \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{[BH^{+}]}\n$$\nwhere $[B]$, $[H^{+}]$, and $[BH^{+}]$ represent the molar concentrations of the neutral base, hydrogen ions, and the protonated base, respectively, at equilibrium.\n\nThe definitions of $pK_a$ and $pH$ are given by the negative base-$10$ logarithm of $K_a$ and $[H^{+}]$, respectively:\n$$\npK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)\n$$\n$$\npH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express $K_a$ and $[H^{+}]$ as:\n$$\nK_a = 10^{-pK_a}\n$$\n$$\n[H^{+}] = 10^{-pH}\n$$\nThe total concentration of the compound, $C_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of the un-ionized form ($B$) and the ionized form ($BH^{+}$), according to the principle of mass balance:\n$$\nC_T = [B] + [BH^{+}]\n$$\nThe fraction of the compound in the un-ionized form, which we will denote as $f_B$, is the ratio of the concentration of the un-ionized form to the total concentration:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{[B]}{C_T} = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + [BH^{+}]}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $f_B$ in terms of $pH$ and $pK_a$, we first rearrange the expression for $K_a$ to express $[BH^{+}]$ in terms of $[B]$:\n$$\n[BH^{+}] = \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{K_a}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[BH^{+}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_B$:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{[B]}{[B] + \\frac{[B][H^{+}]}{K_a}}\n$$\nWe can factor out $[B]$ from the denominator:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{[B]}{[B]\\left(1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_a}\\right)}\n$$\nCanceling the $[B]$ term, which is valid as long as the total concentration is non-zero, yields:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_a}}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the exponential forms of $[H^{+}]$ and $K_a$:\n$$\n\\frac{[H^{+}]}{K_a} = \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}} = 10^{-pH - (-pK_a)} = 10^{pK_a - pH}\n$$\nSubstituting this ratio back into the expression for $f_B$ gives the desired general analytic expression for the fraction of the un-ionized weak base:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the fraction of the neutral species for a weak base depends solely on the difference between the $pK_a$ of its conjugate acid and the $pH$ of the solution.\n\nNow, we evaluate this fraction for the given values: physiological $pH = 7.4$ and the compound's $pK_a = 8.5$.\n$$\npK_a - pH = 8.5 - 7.4 = 1.1\n$$\nSubstituting this value into the expression for $f_B$:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{1.1}}\n$$\nThe numerical value is calculated as:\n$$\nf_B = \\frac{1}{1 + 12.58925...} = \\frac{1}{13.58925...} \\approx 0.0735893\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.07359$. This means that at physiological $pH$, approximately $7.4\\%$ of the compound is in the neutral, un-ionized form, while the remaining approximately $92.6\\%$ is in the ionized, protonated form $BH^{+}$.\n\n**Inference:** According to the pH-partition hypothesis, only the un-ionized fraction of a molecule can passively diffuse across a lipid membrane. Although this therapeutic candidate possesses favorable intrinsic lipophilicity ($\\log P = 2.0$) and a low polar surface area ($\\mathrm{PSA} = 55\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$), its efficacy in crossing the BBB is severely hampered by its high degree of ionization at physiological $pH$. The effective concentration gradient driving passive diffusion is that of the neutral species, which is only about $7.4\\%$ of the total plasma concentration. Consequently, despite otherwise promising characteristics, the compound's high $pK_a$ ($8.5$) is a major liability, and its overall rate of BBB permeation is expected to be substantially limited.",

            "introduction": "While passive permeability is essential, many drug candidates fail due to active efflux, where transporters like P-glycoprotein (P-gp) act as molecular \"bouncers\" to remove them from the brain. Quantifying the magnitude of this efflux is a key task in neuropharmacology. This problem  guides you through the analysis of in vivo microdialysis data, using the unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient ($K_{p,uu,brain}$) to determine if a compound is an efflux substrate and to measure the efficacy of a transport inhibitor.",

            "problem": "A central challenge in translational medicine is optimizing strategies to cross the blood-brain barrier by modulating efflux transport. Consider an unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient, denoted $K_{p,uu,brain}$, defined as the steady-state ratio of unbound drug concentration in brain interstitial fluid to unbound drug concentration in plasma. In a rodent microdialysis study at steady state, a test compound shows $K_{p,uu,brain} = 0.10$ under baseline conditions and $K_{p,uu,brain} = 0.50$ during pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), where P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a key adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette efflux transporter at the blood-brain barrier.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded conditions:\n- The inhibitor selectively reduces P-gp-mediated efflux by a multiplicative factor $s \\in (0,1)$ applied to the baseline P-gp efflux clearance, without altering passive permeability, cerebral blood flow, plasma protein binding, or the integrity of the blood-brain barrier.\n- Carrier-mediated influx is negligible, so net influx is governed by passive diffusion.\n- Microdialysis measurements reflect unbound concentrations, and steady state is achieved in both conditions.\n\nUsing first-principles mass balance for the brain interstitial compartment at steady state and the above assumptions, determine whether the compound behaves as an efflux substrate when P-gp is inhibited, and derive the fractional reduction in P-gp-mediated efflux clearance, defined as $r = 1 - s$. Express your final answer as the decimal fraction $r$ with no unit, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated.\n\nWe begin by establishing a first-principles mass balance model for the concentration of the unbound drug in the brain interstitial fluid at steady state. At steady state, the rate of drug influx into the brain compartment equals the rate of drug efflux from it.\n\nLet $C_{u,brain}$ be the unbound drug concentration in the brain interstitial fluid and $C_{u,plasma}$ be the unbound drug concentration in the plasma. The problem states that carrier-mediated influx is negligible, so the sole influx mechanism is passive diffusion. The influx rate is proportional to the plasma concentration, given by $PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma}$, where $PS_{u}$ is the passive permeability-surface area product clearance for the unbound drug.\n\nEfflux from the brain has two components: passive diffusion back into the plasma, with a rate of $PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,brain}$, and active P-gp-mediated efflux, with a rate of $CL_{active} \\cdot C_{u,brain}$. Here, $CL_{active}$ is the clearance associated with the active P-gp transport system. The model assumes a linear relationship, which is valid for concentrations well below the transporter's Michaelis-Menten constant $K_m$.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Influx} = \\text{Rate of Efflux}\n$$\n$$\nPS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma} = PS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,brain} + CL_{active} \\cdot C_{u,brain}\n$$\n\nWe can factor out $C_{u,brain}$ on the right side:\n$$\nPS_{u} \\cdot C_{u,plasma} = (PS_{u} + CL_{active}) \\cdot C_{u,brain}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the unbound brain-to-plasma partition coefficient, $K_{p,uu,brain}$, as the ratio of the unbound concentrations at steady state:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{C_{u,brain}}{C_{u,plasma}}\n$$\n\nRearranging the mass balance equation to solve for this ratio gives:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{PS_{u}}{PS_{u} + CL_{active}}\n$$\n\nThis equation can be rewritten in a more convenient form by dividing the numerator and denominator by $PS_{u}$:\n$$\nK_{p,uu,brain} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{CL_{active}}{PS_{u}}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that in the absence of active transport ($CL_{active}=0$), $K_{p,uu,brain}$ would be $1$. The presence of an active efflux transporter ($CL_{active}>0$) reduces the unbound brain concentration, resulting in $K_{p,uu,brain} < 1$.\n\nNow, we apply this model to the two conditions given in the problem.\n\n1.  **Baseline Condition**:\n    Let $CL_{active,baseline}$ be the P-gp efflux clearance under baseline conditions. The given partition coefficient is $K_{p,uu,brain,baseline} = 0.10$.\n    $$\n    0.10 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{CL_{active,baseline}}{PS_{u}}}\n    $$\n    Let $J_{baseline} = \\frac{CL_{active,baseline}}{PS_{u}}$ be the baseline efflux ratio, which quantifies the activity of the efflux transporter relative to passive permeability.\n    $$\n    1 + J_{baseline} = \\frac{1}{0.10} = 10\n    $$\n    $$\n    J_{baseline} = 9\n    $$\n    Since $J_{baseline} > 0$, the compound is clearly a P-gp substrate.\n\n2.  **Inhibited Condition**:\n    The inhibitor reduces the P-gp efflux clearance by a multiplicative factor $s$. The new active clearance is $CL_{active,inhibited} = s \\cdot CL_{active,baseline}$. The given partition coefficient is $K_{p,uu,brain,inhibited} = 0.50$. The passive permeability $PS_{u}$ is stated to be unchanged.\n    The new efflux ratio is $J_{inhibited} = \\frac{CL_{active,inhibited}}{PS_{u}} = \\frac{s \\cdot CL_{active,baseline}}{PS_{u}} = s \\cdot J_{baseline}$.\n    $$\n    0.50 = \\frac{1}{1 + J_{inhibited}} = \\frac{1}{1 + s \\cdot J_{baseline}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    1 + s \\cdot J_{baseline} = \\frac{1}{0.50} = 2\n    $$\n    $$\n    s \\cdot J_{baseline} = 1\n    $$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks whether the compound still behaves as an efflux substrate when P-gp is inhibited. For a compound to be an efflux substrate, its active efflux clearance must be greater than zero. Under inhibition, we have $K_{p,uu,brain,inhibited} = 0.50$. Since this value is less than $1$, it signifies that a net efflux process is still operative ($CL_{active,inhibited} > 0$). If the efflux were completely blocked ($CL_{active,inhibited} = 0$), the ratio would be $1$. Therefore, the compound does behave as an efflux substrate, albeit a weaker one, under the inhibited condition.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires deriving the fractional reduction in P-gp-mediated efflux clearance, $r = 1 - s$. We have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $J_{baseline}$ and $s$:\n1) $J_{baseline} = 9$\n2) $s \\cdot J_{baseline} = 1$\n\nSubstituting the value of $J_{baseline}$ from the first equation into the second gives:\n$$\ns \\cdot 9 = 1\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{9}\n$$\n\nThe fractional reduction $r$ is defined as $r = 1 - s$.\n$$\nr = 1 - \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}\n$$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures as requested.\n$$\nr = \\frac{8}{9} \\approx 0.888888...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nr = 0.8889\n$$\nThis result indicates an $88.89\\%$ reduction in the P-gp efflux clearance due to the inhibitor.",

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Analytic Expression**\n\nThe influx rate of the prodrug, $v$, via the LAT1 transporter is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. In the absence of an inhibitor, the rate, denoted as $v_0$, is given by:\n$$ v_0 = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} $$\nwhere $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum influx rate, $[S]$ is the substrate (prodrug) concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the substrate.\n\nFor purely competitive inhibition, the inhibitor $[I]$ binds to the same active site as the substrate. This increases the apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, without affecting $V_{\\max}$. The influx rate in the presence of the inhibitor, denoted as $v_i$, is given by:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m,app} + [S]} $$\nThe apparent Michaelis constant, $K_{m,app}$, is related to $K_m$ by the inhibitor concentration $[I]$ and the inhibitor constant $K_i$:\n$$ K_{m,app} = K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $v_i$ yields:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that inhibitor concentration $[I]$ must be found such that the inhibited rate $v_i$ is one-half of the uninhibited rate $v_0$.\n$$ v_i = \\frac{1}{2} v_0 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v_i$ and $v_0$:\n$$ \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_m + [S]} \\right) $$\nSince the prodrug is administered, its concentration $[S]$ is non-zero. The maximum rate $V_{\\max}$ is also a non-zero constant. Therefore, we can cancel the term $V_{\\max} [S]$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S]} = \\frac{1}{2(K_m + [S])} $$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides gives:\n$$ K_m \\left(1 + \\frac{[I]}{K_i}\\right) + [S] = 2(K_m + [S]) $$\nNow, we solve for $[I]$. Distribute the terms on both sides:\n$$ K_m + \\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} + [S] = 2K_m + 2[S] $$\nIsolate the term containing $[I]$:\n$$ \\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} = (2K_m - K_m) + (2[S] - [S]) $$\n$$ \\frac{K_m [I]}{K_i} = K_m + [S] $$\nFinally, solve for $[I]$:\n$$ [I] = \\frac{K_i}{K_m} (K_m + [S]) $$\nThis expression can be simplified to:\n$$ [I] = K_i \\left(1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m}\\right) $$\nThis is the derived analytic expression for the required inhibitor concentration $[I]$ in terms of $K_m$, $K_i$, and $[S]$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameter values:\n-   $K_m = 50 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $K_i = 2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n-   $[S] = 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nWe substitute these values into the derived expression for $[I]$:\n$$ [I] = (2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}) \\left(1 + \\frac{20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}{50 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}}\\right) $$\nThe units of concentration ($\\mu\\mathrm{M}$) cancel inside the parenthesis:\n$$ [I] = 2 \\left(1 + \\frac{20}{50}\\right) \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ [I] = 2 \\left(1 + 0.4\\right) \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ [I] = 2 (1.4) \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\n$$ [I] = 2.8 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the calculated value of $2.8$ must be written as $2.80$. The final answer is $2.80 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{M}$.",
