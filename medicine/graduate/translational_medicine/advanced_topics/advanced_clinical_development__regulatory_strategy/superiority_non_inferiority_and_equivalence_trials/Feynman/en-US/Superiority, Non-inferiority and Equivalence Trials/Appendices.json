This first exercise  provides foundational practice in translating this margin between the relative risk ratio scale and the absolute risk difference scale. Mastering this translation is a critical skill for understanding how the clinical meaning of a margin can shift depending on the baseline event rate in the control group.",

            "problem": "A translational medicine team is designing a non-inferiority (NI) trial comparing an investigational therapy to a standard-of-care control on an undesirable binary clinical endpoint (e.g., a serious adverse event). The NI margin has been justified on the risk ratio (RR) scale as $\\Delta_{\\text{NI}} = 1.3$, meaning the investigational therapy will be considered non-inferior if its event probability does not exceed $1.3$ times the control event probability. The design team wishes to express the same NI margin on the risk difference (RD) scale to facilitate sample size planning under absolute risk assumptions and to make monitoring rules interpretable on an absolute scale.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions of the risk ratio $RR = \\frac{p_{T}}{p_{C}}$ and the risk difference $RD = p_{T} - p_{C}$, where $p_{T}$ and $p_{C}$ denote the event probabilities for the test (investigational) and control arms respectively, derive the risk difference NI margin as a function of $p_{C}$ and then compute its numerical value at a control event rate of $p_{C} = 0.20$. Express the final numerical translation as a decimal proportion without using a percentage sign.\n\nThen, explain how the dependence of the risk difference margin on $p_{C}$ should inform trial design choices, including implications for margin robustness when $p_{C}$ is uncertain at the planning stage and how this sensitivity might affect sample size under absolute-risk-driven assumptions. Your explanation should be grounded in first principles and must not invoke any pre-given conversion formulas. The numerical answer does not require rounding; provide the exact value.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of clinical trial design and biostatistics, specifically concerning non-inferiority trials. All terms are well-defined ($RR$, $RD$, $p_T$, $p_C$), the premises are consistent, and the required derivations and computations are well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\nWe begin by establishing the mathematical relationship between the non-inferiority (NI) margins on the risk ratio ($RR$) and risk difference ($RD$) scales, starting from first principles.\n\nThe problem provides the following definitions:\nThe risk ratio is defined as $RR = \\frac{p_{T}}{p_{C}}$.\nThe risk difference is defined as $RD = p_{T} - p_{C}$.\nHere, $p_{T}$ is the event probability in the investigational therapy arm, and $p_{C}$ is the event probability in the standard-of-care control arm.\n\nThe non-inferiority margin on the risk ratio scale is given as $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} = 1.3$. This margin defines the boundary of acceptable inferiority. An investigational therapy is considered non-inferior if the true risk ratio is not greater than this value. At this boundary, the event probability in the test arm, which we can denote as $p_{T, \\text{margin}}$, is precisely $1.3$ times the probability in the control arm.\nMathematically, this boundary condition is expressed as:\n$$p_{T, \\text{margin}} = \\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} \\times p_{C}$$\n\nThe non-inferiority margin on the risk difference scale, $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}}$, is the value of the risk difference, $p_{T} - p_{C}$, evaluated at this same boundary of non-inferiority. To find this, we substitute the expression for $p_{T, \\text{margin}}$ into the definition of the risk difference:\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = p_{T, \\text{margin}} - p_{C}$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = (\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} \\times p_{C}) - p_{C}$$\n\nFactoring out $p_{C}$ gives the general expression for the risk difference NI margin as a function of the control event rate $p_{C}$ and the risk ratio NI margin $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}}$:\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = p_{C} (\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} - 1)$$\nThis is the derived function for the risk difference NI margin.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of this margin for the specific case where the control event rate is $p_{C} = 0.20$ and the risk ratio margin is $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} = 1.3$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived formula:\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = 0.20 \\times (1.3 - 1)$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = 0.20 \\times 0.3$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = 0.06$$\nThus, a risk ratio margin of $1.3$ with a control event rate of $20\\%$ is equivalent to an absolute risk difference margin of $6\\%$, or $0.06$.\n\nThe dependence of the risk difference margin on $p_{C}$, as shown by the formula $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = p_{C} (\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} - 1)$, has critical implications for trial design.\n\nFirst, it affects margin robustness. A constant relative margin ($\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}}$) implies a variable absolute margin ($\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}}$) that is directly proportional to the baseline risk $p_{C}$. If the true control event rate in the trial population is lower than the assumed $p_{C} = 0.20$, the equivalent absolute risk margin becomes more stringent. For instance, if the true $p_{C}$ is $0.10$, the RD margin shrinks to $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = 0.10 \\times (1.3 - 1) = 0.03$. Conversely, if $p_{C}$ is higher, say $0.30$, the margin becomes more lenient: $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}} = 0.30 \\times (1.3 - 1) = 0.09$. This means the clinical acceptability of a risk ratio margin is implicitly tied to an assumed baseline risk. Trial designers must conduct sensitivity analyses to ensure that the implied absolute risk increase remains clinically acceptable across a plausible range of $p_{C}$ values that might be observed in the trial.\n\nSecond, this dependence profoundly impacts sample size calculations. The sample size ($N$) for a non-inferiority trial is highly sensitive to the magnitude of the NI margin. For a test of two proportions, the required sample size is inversely proportional to the square of the margin, i.e., $N \\propto (\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}})^{-2}$. The sample size is also dependent on the variance of the endpoint, which for binomial proportions is a function of the event probabilities themselves (approximately proportional to $p_{C}(1-p_{C})$). Combining these dependencies, and assuming equal allocation and that the true rates $p_T$ and $p_C$ are close, the total sample size $N$ can be approximated as being proportional to:\n$$N \\propto \\frac{p_{C}(1-p_{C}) + p_{T}(1-p_{T})}{(\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}})^2}$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RD)}}$ and assuming $p_T \\approx p_C$ for the variance term:\n$$N \\propto \\frac{2 p_{C}(1-p_{C})}{[p_{C}(\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} - 1)]^2} = \\frac{2 p_{C}(1-p_{C})}{p_{C}^2 (\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} - 1)^2} = \\frac{2(1-p_{C})}{p_{C}(\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}} - 1)^2}$$\nSince $\\Delta_{\\text{NI(RR)}}$ is a fixed constant for the design, this reveals that the necessary sample size $N$ is approximately proportional to $\\frac{1-p_C}{p_C}$. This demonstrates a strong inverse relationship between the sample size and the control event rate $p_C$. If the actual control event rate during the trial is lower than the rate assumed for planning ($p_{C} = 0.20$), the required sample size to maintain statistical power will be substantially larger. For instance, halving $p_C$ from $0.20$ to $0.10$ would approximately double the required sample size. Therefore, uncertainty in $p_C$ at the planning stage translates to significant risk of conducting an underpowered study. Trial designers must account for this by either choosing a conservative (i.e., low) estimate for $p_C$ in their primary sample size calculation or planning for adaptive measures such as sample size re-estimation based on the observed control rate.",

Use a one-sided type I error rate $\\alpha$ and target power $1 - \\beta$.
