            "problem": "An industry partner collaborates with an Academic Medical Center (AMC) to run a mid-stage translational trial of a targeted therapy. To improve the probability of demonstrating efficacy, the sponsor proposes a biomarker-based enrichment strategy: only patients who test positive on a companion diagnostic will be enrolled. The diagnostic has measured sensitivity $0.9$ and specificity $0.95$ in prior validation studies. In the AMC’s referred population for this trial, the disease prevalence is $0.2$. Regulatory interactions with the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and engagement with a patient advocacy coalition emphasize quantitative justification for enrichment strategies that do not unduly exclude potential beneficiaries.\n\nUsing the fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes’ theorem for conditional probability, first determine the positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the diagnostic in this AMC population.

Round the final value of $E$ to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing fundamental and well-established concepts from biostatistics and epidemiology, namely sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, predictive values, and Bayes' theorem. The context of a biomarker-based enrichment strategy for a translational clinical trial is a standard and highly relevant application within the specified field. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique and meaningful solution. The language is objective and precise. The provided numerical values are plausible for a real-world diagnostic test. The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A formal solution will be derived.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has the disease and $D^c$ be the event that a patient does not have the disease. Let $T^+$ be the event that a patient tests positive and $T^-$ be the event that a patient tests negative.\n\nThe givens can be expressed in terms of conditional probabilities:\n- The disease prevalence is $P(D) = 0.2$. The probability of a patient not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n- The sensitivity is the true positive rate: $P(T^+ | D) = 0.9$.\n- The specificity is the true negative rate: $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nFrom these, we can determine the false negative rate and the false positive rate:\n- False negative rate: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$.\n- False positive rate: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nTo calculate the predictive values, we first need the overall probability of a positive test, $P(T^+)$, and a negative test, $P(T^-)$, in this population. We use the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.9)(0.2) + (0.05)(0.8) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\nThe total probability of a positive test is $0.22$. This is the proportion of the referred population that will be eligible for enrollment under the enrichment strategy.\n\nSimilarly, for a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)$$\n$$P(T^-) = (0.1)(0.2) + (0.95)(0.8) = 0.02 + 0.76 = 0.78$$\nAs a check, $P(T^+) + P(T^-) = 0.22 + 0.78 = 1.0$, which is consistent.\n\nNow we can apply Bayes' theorem to find the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV).\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient who tests positive actually has the disease, $P(D | T^+)$:\n$$PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.9)(0.2)}{0.22} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11}$$\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient who tests negative is truly disease-free, $P(D^c | T^-)$:\n$$NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.95)(0.8)}{0.78} = \\frac{0.76}{0.78} = \\frac{76}{78} = \\frac{38}{39}$$\n\nThe final task is to calculate the fold-enrichment ratio, $E$. It is defined as the proportion of truly diseased patients among enrolled subjects (test-positives) divided by the baseline disease prevalence. The proportion of diseased patients among the test-positive group is, by definition, the positive predictive value, $P(D | T^+)$. The baseline prevalence is $P(D)$.\n$$E = \\frac{P(D | T^+)}{P(D)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$E = \\frac{9/11}{0.2} = \\frac{9/11}{1/5} = \\frac{9 \\times 5}{11} = \\frac{45}{11}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$E = \\frac{45}{11} \\approx 4.090909...$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $4.091$.",

A critical step in this design is calculating the necessary sample size to ensure the study is properly 'powered' to detect a clinically meaningful effect.

            "problem": "An Academic Medical Center (AMC) collaborating with an industry sponsor, advised by a patient advocacy consortium and under guidance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is designing a two-arm randomized parallel-group clinical trial in translational medicine. The primary endpoint is a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument score measured as change from baseline at a fixed follow-up time. Prior validation work, supported by a government agency, established that the standard deviation of individual change scores is approximately homogeneous across arms and equal to $\\sigma = 1.2$. The minimally important difference, defined through patient-engaged methods, is $\\Delta = 0.3$ on the PRO scale. The trial will use equal allocation, a two-sided Type I error rate $\\alpha = 0.05$, and target power $1 - \\beta = 0.9$ to detect the difference $\\Delta$ between arms.\n\nAssume the following fundamental base:\n- The sampling distribution of the difference in sample means between two independent arms with equal per-arm sample size $n$ and common standard deviation $\\sigma$ is approximately normal with mean equal to the true difference and standard error $\\sqrt{2}\\,\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}$, under large-sample conditions justified by the Central Limit Theorem.\n- Type I error (two-sided) is controlled by a critical value corresponding to the upper $\\alpha/2$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, and power is defined as $1-\\beta$ against the alternative where the true difference equals $\\Delta$.\n\nIgnoring attrition, compute the total sample size $N$ required (sum across both arms) for this design. Use a two-sided test, express all intermediate calculations to at least five significant figures, and report the final $N$ as an integer by rounding up to the nearest whole participant. Your final answer must be a single real-valued number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total sample size $N$ for a two-arm, parallel-group randomized clinical trial. The analysis begins by establishing the statistical framework for hypothesis testing and then deriving the sample size formula based on the provided parameters.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Standard deviation of the change score in the patient-reported outcome: $\\sigma = 1.2$\n- Minimally important difference to be detected between arms: $\\Delta = 0.3$\n- Two-sided Type I error rate: $\\alpha = 0.05$\n- Desired statistical power: $1 - \\beta = 0.9$\n- Equal allocation to the two arms, with $n$ participants per arm.\n\nThe statistical hypotheses for this superiority trial are:\n- Null hypothesis ($H_0$): There is no difference between the mean change scores of the two arms. Let $\\mu_T$ be the mean for the treatment arm and $\\mu_C$ be the mean for the control/comparator arm. Then, $H_0: \\mu_T - \\mu_C = 0$.\n- Alternative hypothesis ($H_A$): There is a difference between the mean change scores. Since the test is two-sided, $H_A: |\\mu_T - \\mu_C| \\neq 0$. For power calculations, we test against the specific alternative that the true difference is the minimally important difference, $\\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta$.\n\nThe test statistic is based on the difference between the sample means, $\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C$. The problem states that this difference is approximately normally distributed. The standard error ($SE$) of the difference, assuming homogeneous variance $\\sigma^2$ and equal sample sizes $n$ per arm, is:\n$$ SE = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\nThe standardized test statistic is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{SE} $$\nFor a two-sided test with significance level $\\alpha$, we reject $H_0$ if $|Z| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2}$ is the upper $(1-\\alpha/2)$ quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nPower ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when the alternative hypothesis is true, i.e., when $\\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta$. Assuming $\\Delta > 0$, the power is dominated by the probability of exceeding the upper critical value:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{SE} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\;\\middle|\\; \\mu_T - \\mu_C = \\Delta \\right) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C$ under the alternative hypothesis, where its mean is $\\Delta$:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{(\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C) - \\Delta}{SE} > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{SE} \\right) $$\nThe term on the left within the probability is a standard normal variable. Let this be $Z'$. The equation becomes:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P(Z' > z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{SE}) $$\nFrom the properties of the standard normal distribution, we know that $P(Z' > -z_{1-\\beta}) = 1-\\beta$. Therefore, the arguments must be equal:\n$$ -z_{1-\\beta} = z_{1-\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{SE} $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the sample size begins by isolating the term containing $n$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{SE} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}/\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{\\Delta\\sqrt{n}}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} $$\nSolving for $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}{\\Delta} $$\nSquaring both sides yields the formula for the sample size per arm, $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{1-\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta})^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\nWe now substitute the numerical values into this formula.\nFirst, we find the required quantiles from the standard normal distribution:\n- For $\\alpha = 0.05$, we need $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{1-0.025} = z_{0.975}$. Using a high-precision value, $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$.\n- For $1-\\beta = 0.9$, we have $\\beta = 0.1$. We need $z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.9}$. Using a high-precision value, $z_{0.9} \\approx 1.28155$.\n\nNow, we perform the calculation for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2(1.2)^2(1.95996 + 1.28155)^2}{(0.3)^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2(1.44)(3.24151)^2}{0.09} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{2.88 \\times 10.507378}{0.09} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{30.2612486}{0.09} $$\n$$ n \\approx 336.236096 $$\nSince the number of participants must be an integer, we must round this value up to the next whole number to ensure that the actual power is at least the target of $0.9$.\n$$ n_{\\text{required}} = \\lceil 336.236096 \\rceil = 337 $$\nThis is the sample size required for *each* of the two arms. The problem asks for the total sample size, $N$, which is the sum across both arms:\n$$ N = 2 \\times n_{\\text{required}} = 2 \\times 337 = 674 $$\nThus, a total of $674$ participants are required for the trial.",

Posterior Distribution of the Effect Size $\\delta$**\n\nWe begin with a prior distribution for the true effect size $\\delta$, which is normal: $\\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\tau_{0}^{2})$. The data from the Phase II trial provides a likelihood function based on the sampling distribution of the estimator $\\hat{\\delta}_{2}$, which is also normal: $\\hat{\\delta}_{2} \\mid \\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\delta, s_{2}^{2})$.\n\nThis is a normal-normal conjugate model. The posterior distribution for $\\delta$, given the observed data $\\hat{\\delta}_{2}$, is also normal: $\\delta \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{post}}, \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2})$. The posterior parameters are calculated by weighting the prior and the data by their respective precisions (inverse variances).\n\nThe prior precision is $1/\\tau_{0}^{2}$ and the data precision is $1/s_{2}^{2}$.\nThe posterior precision is the sum of the prior and data precisions:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{1}{s_{2}^{2}} $$\nThe posterior mean is the precision-weighted average of the prior mean and the observed data:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{post}} = \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_{0}}{\\tau_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{2}}{s_{2}^{2}} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the given values: $\\mu_{0} = 0.05$, $\\tau_{0} = 0.20$, $\\hat{\\delta}_{2} = 0.22$, and $s_{2} = 0.18$.\nThe variances are $\\tau_{0}^{2} = 0.20^{2} = 0.04$ and $s_{2}^{2} = 0.18^{2} = 0.0324$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the posterior precision and variance:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2}} = \\frac{1}{0.04} + \\frac{1}{0.0324} = 25 + \\frac{10000}{324} = 25 + \\frac{2500}{81} = \\frac{2025 + 2500}{81} = \\frac{4525}{81} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2} = \\frac{81}{4525} \\approx 0.01790055 $$\nNext, we calculate the posterior mean:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{81}{4525} \\left( \\frac{0.05}{0.04} + \\frac{0.22}{0.0324} \\right) = \\frac{81}{4525} \\left( 1.25 + \\frac{2200}{324} \\right) = \\frac{81}{4525} \\left( \\frac{5}{4} + \\frac{550}{81} \\right) $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{81}{4525} \\left( \\frac{5 \\cdot 81 + 4 \\cdot 550}{324} \\right) = \\frac{1}{55.864...} \\left( \\frac{405 + 2200}{324} \\right) = \\frac{81}{4525} \\frac{2605}{324} = \\frac{2605}{4 \\times 4525} = \\frac{2605}{18100} = \\frac{521}{3620} \\approx 0.14392265 $$\nSo, the posterior distribution is $\\delta \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0.1439, 0.01790)$.\n\n**2. Predictive Distribution for the Phase III Estimator $\\hat{\\delta}_{3}$**\n\nThe future Phase III outcome, $\\hat{\\delta}_{3}$, is modeled as being centered on the true (but unknown) effect size $\\delta$: $\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\delta \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\delta, s_{3}^{2})$. Our current uncertainty about $\\delta$ is captured by its posterior distribution, $\\delta \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{post}}, \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2})$.\nThe predictive distribution for $\\hat{\\delta}_{3}$ marginalizes over the uncertainty in $\\delta$:\n$$ p(\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2}) = \\int p(\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\delta) p(\\delta \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2}) \\,d\\delta $$\nFor this hierarchical normal model, the resulting predictive distribution is also normal, $\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\hat{\\delta}_{2} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\text{pred}}, s_{\\text{pred}}^{2})$, with parameters:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{pred}} = E[\\hat{\\delta}_{3}] = E[E[\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\delta]] = E[\\delta] = \\mu_{\\text{post}} $$\n$$ s_{\\text{pred}}^{2} = \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{3}) = E[\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\delta)] + \\text{Var}(E[\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\mid \\delta]) = E[s_{3}^{2}] + \\text{Var}(\\delta) = s_{3}^{2} + \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2} $$\nUsing the values from the previous step and the given $s_{3} = 0.12$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\text{pred}} = \\mu_{\\text{post}} \\approx 0.14392265 $$\n$$ s_{\\text{pred}}^{2} = 0.12^{2} + \\tau_{\\text{post}}^{2} = 0.0144 + 0.01790055 = 0.03230055 $$\nThe predictive standard deviation is $s_{\\text{pred}} = \\sqrt{0.03230055} \\approx 0.1797235$.\n\n**3. Probability of Regulatory Success**\n\nRegulatory success is achieved if the one-sided $z$-test is significant at the $\\alpha = 0.025$ level. The condition is:\n$$ \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{3}}{s_{3}} \\ge z_{1-\\alpha} \\implies \\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\ge s_{3} z_{0.975} $$\nUsing the given values $s_{3} = 0.12$ and $z_{0.975} = 1.96$, the success threshold for $\\hat{\\delta}_{3}$ is:\n$$ k = 0.12 \\times 1.96 = 0.2352 $$\nThe probability of success, denoted $p_{S}$, is the probability that the outcome $\\hat{\\delta}_{3}$ from the predictive distribution exceeds this threshold:\n$$ p_{S} = P(\\hat{\\delta}_{3} \\ge 0.2352) $$\nTo calculate this probability, we standardize the variable using the parameters of the predictive distribution:\n$$ p_{S} = P\\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\delta}_{3} - \\mu_{\\text{pred}}}{s_{\\text{pred}}} \\ge \\frac{0.2352 - \\mu_{\\text{pred}}}{s_{\\text{pred}}} \\right) = P\\left( Z \\ge \\frac{0.2352 - 0.14392265}{0.1797235} \\right) $$\nwhere $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$ p_{S} = P\\left( Z \\ge \\frac{0.09127735}{0.1797235} \\right) = P(Z \\ge 0.50787) $$\nUsing the standard normal cumulative distribution function, $\\Phi(z)$:\n$$ p_{S} = 1 - \\Phi(0.50787) \\approx 1 - 0.694226 = 0.305774 $$\n\n**4. Expected Net Value of the \"Go\" Decision**\n\nThe problem asks for the expected net value of the \"Go\" decision, $\\text{EV}_{\\text{Go}}$. This decision involves an immediate cost $C_{3}$ followed by a probabilistic outcome. If the trial succeeds (with probability $p_{S}$), a value $V$ is realized. If it fails (with probability $1 - p_{S}$), the value is $0$. The expected gross value is $p_{S} \\times V + (1-p_{S}) \\times 0 = p_{S}V$. The expected net value is this gross value minus the initial cost:\n$$ \\text{EV}_{\\text{Go}} = p_{S} \\times V - C_{3} $$\nSubstituting the known values $V = 1200$ (million USD), $C_{3} = 180$ (million USD), and our calculated $p_{S}$:\n$$ \\text{EV}_{\\text{Go}} = 0.305774 \\times 1200 - 180 $$\n$$ \\text{EV}_{\\text{Go}} = 366.9288 - 180 = 186.9288 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{EV}_{\\text{Go}} \\approx 186.9 $$\nThe value is expressed in millions of USD.",
