Bayes' theorem provides a powerful framework to formally update your belief in a project's potential as new data becomes available.

            "problem": "An early-stage biotechnology venture in translational medicine is evaluating whether to allocate seed capital to a therapeutic candidate based on a binary preclinical assay that reports a positive result when a biomarker threshold is met. Let the event of the candidate having true efficacy be denoted by $T$, and let the observed preclinical assay outcome be denoted by $+$ for a positive result and $-$ for a negative result. The assay has sensitivity $Se$ and specificity $Sp$, and the venture team’s prior belief about true efficacy is $p$. Assume that $+$ and $-$ are conditionally independent of all other information given $T$ or $\\neg T$, and that the assay operates with fixed $Se$ and $Sp$ across candidates within this modality.\n\nStarting from the definition of sensitivity $Se = P(+|T)$, specificity $Sp = P(-|\\neg T)$, and Bayes’ theorem, express the posterior probability $P(T|+)$ in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$. Then, for an assay with $Se = 0.80$, $Sp = 0.90$, and a prior $p = 0.20$, compute the posterior probability of true efficacy after observing a positive preclinical assay.

The application to a preclinical assay in biotechnology is a standard and realistic scenario.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary variables ($Se$, $Sp$, $p$) are defined and their values are provided for the numerical calculation. The question is unambiguous and has a single, computable solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will now proceed to solve it.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the posterior probability of true efficacy given a positive assay result, denoted as $P(T|+)$. We begin with Bayes' theorem:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{P(+|T) P(T)}{P(+)}\n$$\nThe terms in the numerator are given directly by the problem statement:\n1.  $P(+|T)$ is the sensitivity of the assay, $Se$.\n2.  $P(T)$ is the prior probability of true efficacy, $p$.\n\nSo, the numerator is $Se \\cdot p$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of observing a positive result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, conditioning on whether the candidate has true efficacy ($T$) or not ($\\neg T$):\n$$\nP(+) = P(+|T)P(T) + P(+|\\neg T)P(\\neg T)\n$$\nWe need to express each term in this expansion using the given variables $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n-   $P(+|T) = Se$ (given by the definition of sensitivity).\n-   $P(T) = p$ (given as the prior probability).\n-   $P(\\neg T)$ is the probability that the candidate does not have true efficacy, which is $1 - P(T) = 1 - p$.\n-   $P(+|\\neg T)$ is the probability of a positive result given no true efficacy (a false positive). This is related to the specificity, $Sp = P(-|\\neg T)$. Since an assay result is either positive or negative, $P(+|\\neg T) + P(-|\\neg T) = 1$. Therefore, the false positive rate is $P(+|\\neg T) = 1 - Sp$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(+)$:\n$$\nP(+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for the numerator and the denominator back into Bayes' theorem to get the final general formula for the posterior probability $P(T|+)$:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}\n$$\nThis is the desired expression for the posterior probability in terms of $Se$, $Sp$, and $p$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the given case:\n-   $Se = 0.80$\n-   $Sp = 0.90$\n-   $p = 0.20$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{(0.80)(0.20)}{(0.80)(0.20) + (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20)}\n$$\nLet's calculate the components of the expression.\nThe numerator is:\n$$\nSe \\cdot p = 0.80 \\times 0.20 = 0.16\n$$\nThe first term in the denominator is the same as the numerator:\n$$\nSe \\cdot p = 0.16\n$$\nThe second term in the denominator is:\n$$\n(1 - Sp)(1 - p) = (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.20) = (0.10)(0.80) = 0.08\n$$\nThe total denominator is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\nP(+) = 0.16 + 0.08 = 0.24\n$$\nFinally, the posterior probability is the ratio of the numerator to the denominator:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{0.16}{0.24}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified:\n$$\nP(T|+) = \\frac{16}{24} = \\frac{2 \\times 8}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.6667$.\n\nThus, after observing a positive result from an assay with $80\\%$ sensitivity and $90\\%$ specificity, the venture team's belief in the candidate's true efficacy should be updated from a prior of $20\\%$ to a posterior of approximately $66.67\\%$.",

The board requires that the company must not fall below a minimum cash buffer before new funds are deposited at close.\n\nUse the following scientifically realistic and internally consistent plan:\n\n- Initial cash at month $0$: $C_0 = \\$12{,}000{,}000$.\n- Price per assay: $p = \\$600$.\n- COGS per assay: for months $t = 1$ through $t = 6$, $c_t = \\$350$; for months $t = 7$ through $t = 24$, $c_t = \\$300$.\n- Monthly unit forecast $u_t$:\n  - Months $t = 1,2$: $u_t = 0$.\n  - Month $t = 3$: $u_3 = 100$.\n  - Month $t = 4$: $u_4 = 200$.\n  - Month $t = 5$: $u_5 = 400$.\n  - Month $t = 6$: $u_6 = 600$.\n  - Month $t = 7$: $u_7 = 800$.\n  - Month $t = 8$: $u_8 = 1000$.\n  - Month $t = 9$: $u_9 = 1200$.\n  - Month $t = 10$: $u_{10} = 1400$.\n  - Month $t = 11$: $u_{11} = 1600$.\n  - Month $t = 12$: $u_{12} = 1800$.\n  - Month $t = 13$: $u_{13} = 2000$; then increase by $200$ units per month so that $u_{14} = 2200$, $u_{15} = 2400$, $u_{16} = 2600$, $u_{17} = 2800$, $u_{18} = 3000$, $u_{19} = 3200$, $u_{20} = 3400$, $u_{21} = 3600$, $u_{22} = 3800$, $u_{23} = 4000$, $u_{24} = 4200$.\n- Fixed operating expenses per month (GA plus RD): $F = \\$400{,}000$.\n- Payroll $P_t$ according to the hiring plan:\n  - Months $t = 1,2,3$: $P_t = \\$350{,}000$.\n  - Months $t = 4,5,6,7$: $P_t = \\$430{,}000$.\n  - Months $t = 8,9,10,11,12,13$: $P_t = \\$550{,}000$.\n  - Months $t = 14,15,16,17$: $P_t = \\$700{,}000$.\n  - Months $t = 18,19,20,21,22,23,24$: $P_t = \\$900{,}000$.\n- One-time project expenditures $L_t$:\n  - Month $t = 6$: $L_6 = \\$500{,}000$ (regulatory submission).\n  - Month $t = 10$: $L_{10} = \\$1{,}200{,}000$ (pivotal study start).\n  - Month $t = 15$: $L_{15} = \\$2{,}500{,}000$ (expansion trial start).\n  - Month $t = 20$: $L_{20} = \\$1{,}500{,}000$ (commercial scale-up and marketing).\n  - Month $t = 23$: $L_{23} = \\$1{,}000{,}000$ (regulatory fees).\n- Revenue $R_t$ and variable cost $V_t$ obey the standard definitions $R_t = p \\cdot u_t$ and $V_t = c_t \\cdot u_t$.\n- Monthly burn is defined as $\\text{burn}_t = F + P_t + L_t + V_t - R_t$.\n- Cash recursion is $C_t = C_{t-1} - \\text{burn}_t$ with $C_0$ given above.\n- The expected fundraise duration is $D = 5$ months from kick-off to funds deposited, where deposit occurs at the beginning of month $m + D$ if the raise is initiated at the beginning of month $m$.\n- The minimum cash buffer requirement is $B = \\$1{,}000{,}000$, to be respected at the end of every month prior to deposit; equivalently, $C_{m + D - 1} \\geq B$ must hold.\n\nUsing these base definitions only, determine the latest integer month index $m$ (counting $m = 1$ as the first month of operations) at which the company can initiate the fundraise such that the buffer requirement is satisfied until the expected deposit occurs. Express your final answer as the integer month index $m$. No rounding is required because $m$ is an integer by definition. Do not include units in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires determining the latest integer month, $m$, to initiate a fundraise, subject to a minimum cash buffer constraint. The solution involves modeling the company's cash balance over a $24$-month period.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens**\n- Initial cash: $C_0 = \\$12{,}000{,}000$.\n- Price per assay: $p = \\$600$.\n- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) per assay: $c_t = \\$350$ for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, 6\\}$; $c_t = \\$300$ for $t \\in \\{7, \\dots, 24\\}$.\n- Monthly unit forecast $u_t$ (as specified in the problem).\n- Fixed operating expenses per month: $F = \\$400{,}000$.\n- Monthly payroll $P_t$ (as specified in the problem).\n- One-time project expenditures $L_t$ (as specified for months $t=6, 10, 15, 20, 23$).\n- Revenue: $R_t = p \\cdot u_t$.\n- Variable cost: $V_t = c_t \\cdot u_t$.\n- Monthly burn: $\\text{burn}_t = F + P_t + L_t + V_t - R_t$.\n- Cash recursion: $C_t = C_{t-1} - \\text{burn}_t$.\n- Fundraise duration: $D = 5$ months.\n- Minimum cash buffer: $B = \\$1{,}000{,}000$.\n- Fundraise constraint: A fundraise initiated at the start of month $m$ results in a deposit at the start of month $m+D$. The cash balance at the end of all months prior to deposit must not fall below the buffer. This is equivalent to requiring $C_t \\ge B$ for all $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m+D-1\\}$. Since the operational burn is always positive within the forecast horizon, this simplifies to checking the final month before the deposit, i.e., $C_{m+D-1} \\ge B$.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses standard financial modeling concepts (cash flow, burn rate, runway) applicable to biotechnology start-ups. The values for revenue, costs, and capital are realistic for this sector. The problem is grounded in the a field of translational medicine, specifically entrepreneurship aspects.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and a clear, objective question. It asks for a single integer value, the latest month $m$, for which a well-defined mathematical constraint is met. A unique solution is expected.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the month-end cash balance, $C_t$, for each month $t$ and then identify the last month $m$ to initiate fundraising without breaching the cash buffer $B$. The fundraise takes $D=5$ months. If started in month $m$, funds arrive at the start of month $m+5$. The buffer must be respected through the end of month $m+4$. That is, $C_t \\geq B$ for all $t \\leq m+4$. Given the company's high burn rate, the cash balance $C_t$ is expected to be a monotonically decreasing function of time. Thus, the condition simplifies to checking the cash balance at the end of the last month before funds arrive: $C_{m+4} \\ge B$.\n\nWe compute the cash balance month by month. The monthly burn is $\\text{burn}_t = (F + P_t + L_t) + (c_t \\cdot u_t) - (p \\cdot u_t)$.\nThe cash balance evolves as $C_t = C_{t-1} - \\text{burn}_t$.\n\nThe calculations are performed sequentially for $t=1, 2, \\dots, 24$. All values are in US dollars.\n\n- **For $t=1$**: $u_1=0$. $R_1=0$, $V_1=0$. $P_1=\\$350{,}000$. $L_1=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_1 = 400000 + 350000 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 750000$.\n$C_1 = 12000000 - 750000 = 11250000$.\n\n- **For $t=2$**: $u_2=0$. $R_2=0$, $V_2=0$. $P_2=\\$350{,}000$. $L_2=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_2 = 400000 + 350000 + 0 + 0 - 0 = 750000$.\n$C_2 = 11250000 - 750000 = 10500000$.\n\n- **For $t=3$**: $u_3=100$, $p=600$, $c_3=350$. $R_3=60000$, $V_3=35000$. $P_3=\\$350{,}000$. $L_3=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_3 = 400000 + 350000 + 0 + 35000 - 60000 = 725000$.\n$C_3 = 10500000 - 725000 = 9775000$.\n\n- **For $t=4$**: $u_4=200$, $p=600$, $c_4=350$. $R_4=120000$, $V_4=70000$. $P_4=\\$430{,}000$. $L_4=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_4 = 400000 + 430000 + 0 + 70000 - 120000 = 780000$.\n$C_4 = 9775000 - 780000 = 8995000$.\n\n- **For $t=5$**: $u_5=400$, $p=600$, $c_5=350$. $R_5=240000$, $V_5=140000$. $P_5=\\$430{,}000$. $L_5=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_5 = 400000 + 430000 + 0 + 140000 - 240000 = 730000$.\n$C_5 = 8995000 - 730000 = 8265000$.\n\n- **For $t=6$**: $u_6=600$, $p=600$, $c_6=350$. $R_6=360000$, $V_6=210000$. $P_6=\\$430{,}000$. $L_6=\\$500{,}000$.\n$\\text{burn}_6 = 400000 + 430000 + 500000 + 210000 - 360000 = 1180000$.\n$C_6 = 8265000 - 1180000 = 7085000$.\n\n- **For $t=7$**: $u_7=800$, $p=600$, $c_7=300$. $R_7=480000$, $V_7=240000$. $P_7=\\$430{,}000$. $L_7=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_7 = 400000 + 430000 + 0 + 240000 - 480000 = 590000$.\n$C_7 = 7085000 - 590000 = 6495000$.\n\n- **For $t=8$**: $u_8=1000$, $p=600$, $c_8=300$. $R_8=600000$, $V_8=300000$. $P_8=\\$550{,}000$. $L_8=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_8 = 400000 + 550000 + 0 + 300000 - 600000 = 650000$.\n$C_8 = 6495000 - 650000 = 5845000$.\n\n- **For $t=9$**: $u_9=1200$, $p=600$, $c_9=300$. $R_9=720000$, $V_9=360000$. $P_9=\\$550{,}000$. $L_9=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_9 = 400000 + 550000 + 0 + 360000 - 720000 = 590000$.\n$C_9 = 5845000 - 590000 = 5255000$.\n\n- **For $t=10$**: $u_{10}=1400$, $p=600$, $c_{10}=300$. $R_{10}=840000$, $V_{10}=420000$. $P_{10}=\\$550{,}000$. $L_{10}=\\$1{,}200{,}000$.\n$\\text{burn}_{10} = 400000 + 550000 + 1200000 + 420000 - 840000 = 1730000$.\n$C_{10} = 5255000 - 1730000 = 3525000$.\n\n- **For $t=11$**: $u_{11}=1600$, $p=600$, $c_{11}=300$. $R_{11}=960000$, $V_{11}=480000$. $P_{11}=\\$550{,}000$. $L_{11}=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_{11} = 400000 + 550000 + 0 + 480000 - 960000 = 470000$.\n$C_{11} = 3525000 - 470000 = 3055000$.\n\n- **For $t=12$**: $u_{12}=1800$, $p=600$, $c_{12}=300$. $R_{12}=1080000$, $V_{12}=540000$. $P_{12}=\\$550{,}000$. $L_{12}=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_{12} = 400000 + 550000 + 0 + 540000 - 1080000 = 410000$.\n$C_{12} = 3055000 - 410000 = 2645000$.\n\n- **For $t=13$**: $u_{13}=2000$, $p=600$, $c_{13}=300$. $R_{13}=1200000$, $V_{13}=600000$. $P_{13}=\\$550{,}000$. $L_{13}=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_{13} = 400000 + 550000 + 0 + 600000 - 1200000 = 350000$.\n$C_{13} = 2645000 - 350000 = 2295000$.\n\n- **For $t=14$**: $u_{14}=2200$, $p=600$, $c_{14}=300$. $R_{14}=1320000$, $V_{14}=660000$. $P_{14}=\\$700{,}000$. $L_{14}=0$.\n$\\text{burn}_{14} = 400000 + 700000 + 0 + 660000 - 1320000 = 440000$.\n$C_{14} = 2295000 - 440000 = 1855000$.\n\n- **For $t=15$**: $u_{15}=2400$, $p=600$, $c_{15}=300$. $R_{15}=1440000$, $V_{15}=720000$. $P_{15}=\\$700{,}000$. $L_{15}=\\$2{,}500{,}000$.\n$\\text{burn}_{15} = 400000 + 700000 + 2500000 + 720000 - 1440000 = 2880000$.\n$C_{15} = 1855000 - 2880000 = -1025000$.\n\nThe cash balance first drops below the minimum buffer of $B = \\$1{,}000{,}000$ at the end of month $t=15$, where $C_{15} = -\\$1{,}025{,}000$. In fact, it becomes negative.\n\nWe need to find the latest integer month $m$ to initiate the fundraise. The condition is $C_{m+4} \\ge B$. Since the first violation occurs at $t=15$, we must ensure that the fundraising period concludes before the end of month $15$. This means we must have $m+4  15$, which implies $m  11$. The largest integer $m$ satisfying this inequality is $m=10$.\n\nLet's verify this choice.\n- **If $m=10$**: Initiate fundraise at the start of month $10$. Funds arrive at the start of month $10+5=15$. The buffer must be maintained through the end of month $14$. We require $C_{14} \\ge B$. From our calculation, $C_{14} = \\$1{,}855{,}000$, which is greater than $B = \\$1{,}000{,}000$. All prior cash balances, $C_1, \\dots, C_{13}$, are also well above the buffer. Thus, $m=10$ is a valid start month.\n\n- **If $m=11$**: Initiate fundraise at the start of month $11$. Funds arrive at the start of month $11+5=16$. The buffer must be maintained through the end of month $15$. We require $C_{15} \\ge B$. From our calculation, $C_{15} = -\\$1{,}025{,}000$, which is less than $B = \\$1{,}000{,}000$. The condition is violated. Thus, $m=11$ is too late.\n\nTherefore, the latest integer month at which the company can initiate the fundraise is $m=10$.",
