            "problem": "A biomedical startup in translational medicine plans a single therapeutic program through staged development to regulatory approval. Venture capital financing is structured around stage-gates, with capital deployed against stage budgets and monitored via burn rate. For this program, the planned stage budgets and durations are: discovery research $5\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $2$ years, preclinical studies $12\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $1.5$ years, Investigational New Drug (IND) and Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) enabling work $6\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $1$ year, Phase I clinical trial $15\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $1$ year, Phase II clinical trial $35\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $2$ years, and Phase III clinical trial $90\\,\\mathrm{M}$ over $3$ years. Using the fundamental definitions that cumulative capital is the sum of stage budgets, and that average monthly burn is the stage budget divided by the stage duration in months, compute the cumulative capital required to complete Phase III and the average monthly burn for each stage. Assume $12$ months per year and take the durations at face value. Express all monetary values in millions of dollars and express burn rates in millions of dollars per month. Round each numerical value to three significant figures. Provide your final answer as a row matrix in the order: $\\big[$cumulative capital required, discovery burn, preclinical burn, IND/CMC burn, Phase I burn, Phase II burn, Phase III burn$\\big]$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is a well-posed problem in applied finance, grounded in realistic parameters relevant to the field of translational medicine. It provides all necessary data and clear, unambiguous definitions for the quantities to be calculated. The problem is self-contained, objective, and scientifically grounded in the context of business administration and project management. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two types of quantities: the total cumulative capital required and the average monthly burn rate for each development stage. All monetary values are to be expressed in millions of dollars, and all burn rates in millions of dollars per month. Each final numerical value must be rounded to three significant figures.\n\nLet us denote the budget for each stage $k$ as $B_k$ and its duration in years as $T_k$. The stages are indexed as follows: $d$ for discovery research, $p$ for preclinical studies, $ic$ for IND/CMC work, $I$ for Phase I, $II$ for Phase II, and $III$ for Phase III.\n\nThe given data are:\n-   Discovery (d): $B_d = 5$, $T_d = 2$ years\n-   Preclinical (p): $B_p = 12$, $T_p = 1.5$ years\n-   IND/CMC (ic): $B_{ic} = 6$, $T_{ic} = 1$ year\n-   Phase I (I): $B_I = 15$, $T_I = 1$ year\n-   Phase II (II): $B_{II} = 35$, $T_{II} = 2$ years\n-   Phase III (III): $B_{III} = 90$, $T_{III} = 3$ years\n\nFirst, we calculate the cumulative capital required to complete Phase III, denoted as $C_{total}$. This is defined as the sum of all stage budgets.\n$$C_{total} = B_d + B_p + B_{ic} + B_I + B_{II} + B_{III}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{total} = 5 + 12 + 6 + 15 + 35 + 90 = 163$$\nThe cumulative capital required is $163$ million dollars. As $163$ has three significant figures, no rounding is necessary.\n\nNext, we calculate the average monthly burn rate, $R_k$, for each stage. The definition provided is the stage budget divided by the stage duration in months. Let $T'_k$ be the duration of stage $k$ in months. Given that there are $12$ months in a year, we have $T'_k = T_k \\times 12$. The formula for the burn rate is:\n$$R_k = \\frac{B_k}{T'_k} = \\frac{B_k}{T_k \\times 12}$$\n\nWe now apply this formula to each stage:\n\n1.  **Discovery Research (d):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_d = 2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_d = \\frac{B_d}{T'_d} = \\frac{5}{24} \\approx 0.208333...$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $R_d = 0.208$.\n\n2.  **Preclinical Studies (p):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_p = 1.5 \\times 12 = 18$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_p = \\frac{B_p}{T'_p} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.666666...$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $R_p = 0.667$.\n\n3.  **IND/CMC Enabling Work (ic):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_{ic} = 1 \\times 12 = 12$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_{ic} = \\frac{B_{ic}}{T'_{ic}} = \\frac{6}{12} = 0.5$.\n    To express this with three significant figures, we write $R_{ic} = 0.500$.\n\n4.  **Phase I Clinical Trial (I):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_I = 1 \\times 12 = 12$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_I = \\frac{B_I}{T'_I} = \\frac{15}{12} = 1.25$.\n    This value already has three significant figures, so $R_I = 1.25$.\n\n5.  **Phase II Clinical Trial (II):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_{II} = 2 \\times 12 = 24$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_{II} = \\frac{B_{II}}{T'_{II}} = \\frac{35}{24} \\approx 1.458333...$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, we get $R_{II} = 1.46$.\n\n6.  **Phase III Clinical Trial (III):**\n    The duration in months is $T'_{III} = 3 \\times 12 = 36$.\n    The average monthly burn rate is $R_{III} = \\frac{B_{III}}{T'_{III}} = \\frac{90}{36} = 2.5$.\n    To express this with three significant figures, we write $R_{III} = 2.50$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a row matrix in the specific order:\n$\\big[$cumulative capital, discovery burn, preclinical burn, IND/CMC burn, Phase I burn, Phase II burn, Phase III burn$\\big]$.\n\nThe calculated values are:\n-   Cumulative capital: $163$\n-   Discovery burn ($R_d$): $0.208$\n-   Preclinical burn ($R_p$): $0.667$\n-   IND/CMC burn ($R_{ic}$): $0.500$\n-   Phase I burn ($R_I$): $1.25$\n-   Phase II burn ($R_{II}$): $1.46$\n-   Phase III burn ($R_{III}$): $2.50$\n\nThese values will be assembled into the final matrix.",

            "introduction": "Early-stage financing rounds are rarely a simple exchange of cash for equity; they often involve complex instruments and terms that significantly impact ownership. This practice delves into a realistic financing scenario involving a convertible note, which bridges a company to its priced equity round, and the common practice of expanding the employee option pool . Working through these mechanics is critical for understanding how different financing tools interact and affect the capitalization table, providing a clear picture of founder dilution.",
            "id": "5059260",
            "problem": "A biomedical startup is raising institutional venture capital to fund translational milestones. Prior to the round, the capitalization consists of founders and an employee option pool. There is an outstanding convertible note with principal $2\\,\\text{M}$ carrying a valuation cap of $12\\,\\text{M}$ and a discount of $20\\%$. The priced round is negotiated at a pre-money valuation of $18\\,\\text{M}$, with $10\\,\\text{M}$ of new primary capital to be issued at the round price. The investors require a pre-round option pool expansion from $10\\%$ to $15\\%$, measured on the pre-money, fully diluted capitalization.\n\nAssume the following standard definitions and practices:\n- The pre-money valuation $V_{\\text{pre}}$ excludes the converting note and the new cash investment.\n- The pre-money, fully diluted capitalization $S_{\\text{pre}}$ includes all existing shares held by founders and the full employee option pool at the target $15\\%$, and excludes the note and any new investor or note conversion shares.\n- The round price per share is $P_0 = V_{\\text{pre}}/S_{\\text{pre}}$.\n- The note converts in the round at a price per share equal to the minimum of the discount price and the cap price, where the discount price is $(1-0.20)\\,P_0$ and the cap price is $12\\,\\text{M}/S_{\\text{pre}}$.\n- The new investors purchase $10\\,\\text{M}$ of shares at price $P_0$.\n- Founders’ shares are fixed before the pool expansion; the pool is expanded pre-money so that it equals $15\\%$ of $S_{\\text{pre}}$ immediately prior to the issuance of any new investor or note conversion shares.\n\nCompute the founders’ post-closing, fully diluted ownership fraction as a single exact number (express as a simplified fraction; do not use a percentage sign).",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be self-contained, consistent, and well-posed. It presents a standard quantitative finance problem related to venture capital financing and capitalization table modeling. The definitions are precise, and the objective is clear. The problem is scientifically grounded within the principles of corporate finance. Therefore, a complete solution can be derived.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the problem statement:\n- $V_{\\text{pre}}$: The pre-money valuation, given as $\\$18 \\times 10^6$.\n- $I$: The new cash investment from the priced round, given as $\\$10 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_P$: The principal amount of the outstanding convertible note, given as $\\$2 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_{cap}$: The valuation cap on the convertible note, given as $\\$12 \\times 10^6$.\n- $N_d$: The discount on the convertible note, given as $20\\%$ or $0.20$.\n- $o_{EOP}$: The target percentage for the employee option pool (EOP), given as $15\\%$ or $0.15$.\n- $S_F$: The number of shares held by founders.\n- $S_{EOP}$: The number of shares in the expanded employee option pool.\n- $S_{pre}$: The total pre-money, fully diluted number of shares. This is the basis for the pre-money valuation.\n- $P_0$: The price per share for the new financing round.\n- $P_N$: The conversion price per share for the convertible note.\n- $S_N$: The number of shares issued upon conversion of the note.\n- $S_I$: The number of shares issued to the new investors.\n- $S_{post}$: The total post-closing, fully diluted number of shares.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the founders' post-closing ownership fraction, which is the ratio $\\frac{S_F}{S_{post}}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the composition of the pre-money capitalization. The problem states that the pre-money, fully diluted capitalization, $S_{pre}$, includes all founders' shares and the full employee option pool at its target size of $15\\%$.\n$$S_{pre} = S_F + S_{EOP}$$\nThe problem also specifies that the EOP must constitute $15\\%$ of this pre-money capitalization.\n$$S_{EOP} = o_{EOP} \\times S_{pre} = 0.15 S_{pre}$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$S_{pre} = S_F + 0.15 S_{pre}$$\nSolving for $S_F$ in terms of $S_{pre}$:\n$$(1 - 0.15) S_{pre} = S_F$$\n$$S_F = 0.85 S_{pre}$$\nThis equation signifies that after the option pool is expanded to its target size, the founders hold $85\\%$ of the pre-money, fully diluted shares. The absolute number of shares, $S_{pre}$, is not given, but we can express all share quantities in terms of it.\n\nNext, we determine the price per share for the new round, $P_0$. It is defined as the pre-money valuation divided by the pre-money shares.\n$$P_0 = \\frac{V_{\\text{pre}}}{S_{pre}} = \\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\n\nThe convertible note converts at a price per share, $P_N$, which is the minimum of a discount price, $P_{discount}$, and a cap price, $P_{cap}$.\nThe discount price is calculated from the round price $P_0$.\n$$P_{discount} = (1 - N_d) P_0 = (1 - 0.20) P_0 = 0.80 P_0$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_0$:\n$$P_{discount} = 0.80 \\left(\\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}\\right) = \\frac{14.4 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\nThe cap price is defined by the valuation cap and the pre-money shares.\n$$P_{cap} = \\frac{N_{cap}}{S_{pre}} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\nTo determine the conversion price $P_N$, we compare $P_{discount}$ and $P_{cap}$. Since $12 \\times 10^6 < 14.4 \\times 10^6$, it is clear that $P_{cap} < P_{discount}$. Therefore, the note converts at the cap price.\n$$P_N = \\min(P_{discount}, P_{cap}) = P_{cap} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the number of shares issued to the new investors, $S_I$, and to the note holders, $S_N$.\nThe new investors invest an amount $I$ at the price $P_0$.\n$$S_I = \\frac{I}{P_0} = \\frac{10 \\times 10^6}{\\frac{18 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}} = \\frac{10}{18} S_{pre} = \\frac{5}{9} S_{pre}$$\nThe note holders convert their principal $N_P$ at the price $P_N$.\n$$S_N = \\frac{N_P}{P_N} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{\\frac{12 \\times 10^6}{S_{pre}}} = \\frac{2}{12} S_{pre} = \\frac{1}{6} S_{pre}$$\n\nThe total number of post-closing, fully diluted shares, $S_{post}$, is the sum of the pre-money shares, the shares issued to note holders, and the shares issued to new investors.\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} + S_N + S_I$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $S_N$ and $S_I$ in terms of $S_{pre}$:\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} + \\frac{1}{6} S_{pre} + \\frac{5}{9} S_{pre}$$\nFactoring out $S_{pre}$:\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{5}{9}\\right)$$\nTo sum the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $18$.\n$$S_{post} = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{18}{18} + \\frac{3}{18} + \\frac{10}{18}\\right) = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{18 + 3 + 10}{18}\\right) = S_{pre} \\left(\\frac{31}{18}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the founders' post-closing, fully diluted ownership fraction. This is the ratio of the founders' shares, $S_F$, to the total post-closing shares, $S_{post}$.\n$$\\text{Founders' Fraction} = \\frac{S_F}{S_{post}}$$\nWe previously found $S_F = 0.85 S_{pre}$. Substituting our expressions for $S_F$ and $S_{post}$:\n$$\\text{Founders' Fraction} = \\frac{0.85 S_{pre}}{\\frac{31}{18} S_{pre}}$$\nThe term $S_{pre}$ cancels, as expected. We are left with a numerical calculation.\n$$\\text{Founders' Fraction} = \\frac{0.85}{\\frac{31}{18}} = \\frac{\\frac{85}{100}}{\\frac{31}{18}} = \\frac{\\frac{17}{20}}{\\frac{31}{18}}$$\n$$\\text{Founders' Fraction} = \\frac{17}{20} \\times \\frac{18}{31} = \\frac{17 \\times 18}{20 \\times 31}$$\nWe can simplify the fraction by dividing $18$ and $20$ by their greatest common divisor, $2$.\n$$\\text{Founders' Fraction} = \\frac{17 \\times 9}{10 \\times 31} = \\frac{153}{310}$$\nThe prime factorization of the numerator is $153 = 3^2 \\times 17$, and for the denominator is $310 = 2 \\times 5 \\times 31$. There are no common factors, so the fraction is in its simplest form.",

            "problem": "A venture capital investor is evaluating a single-asset biomedical startup at the pre-Phase I decision point using risk-adjusted Net Present Value (rNPV). The evaluation must be grounded in the following fundamental base: the time value of money (the present value of a deterministic cash flow at time $t$ discounted at rate $r$ is $CF_t/(1+r)^t$) and the law of total expectation for probabilistic cash flows (the expected present value of a cash flow realized only upon survival to time $t$ with survival probability $s_t$ is $s_t \\times CF_t/(1+r)^t$).

I will first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Definition of rNPV**: The sum over all expected discounted inflows minus the sum over all expected discounted outflows.\n- **Expected Present Value (PV) Formula**: For a cash flow $CF_t$ at time $t$ with survival probability $s_t$ and discrete annual discount rate $r$, the expected PV is $\\frac{s_t \\times CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$.\n- **Conditional Probabilities of Success (PoS)**:\n  - Phase I to Phase II: $p_{\\text{I}} = 0.60$\n  - Phase II to Phase III: $p_{\\text{II}} = 0.35$\n  - Phase III to Approval: $p_{\\text{III}} = 0.60$\n- **Discount Rate**: Annual discrete rate $r=0.10$.\n- **Cash Flows (Outflows)** in millions of USD (MUSD):\n  - Phase I Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase I}} = 10$ at year $t=0$.\n  - Phase II Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase II}} = 25$ at year $t=2$.\n  - Phase III Cost: $C_{\\text{Phase III}} = 80$ at year $t=5$.\n- **Cash Flows (Inflows)** in MUSD:\n  - Approval/Launch Inflow: $200$ at year $t=9$.\n  - Perpetual Royalty Stream: $30$ per year, commencing at year $t=10$.\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - Evaluation is at pre-Phase I (time $t=0$).\n  - Phase I cost is certain upon proceeding.\n  - Phase transitions are independent.\n  - Survival probability $s_t$ is the product of preceding conditional PoS.\n  - The royalty stream is a level perpetuity valued at rate $r$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is validated as follows:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses standard and well-established principles of financial valuation, specifically discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis adapted for probabilistic outcomes (rNPV). This is a common methodology in the biopharmaceutical and venture capital industries. The provided probabilities and cost/revenue figures, while simplified, are representative of magnitudes encountered in drug development. The model is scientifically and financially sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (cash flows, timings, probabilities, discount rate) and a clear, unambiguous objective (compute rNPV). There are no missing or contradictory pieces of information. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free from subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe risk-adjusted Net Present Value (rNPV) is the sum of the expected present values of all future cash inflows minus the sum of the expected present values of all future cash outflows.\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} = \\sum_{t} \\frac{s_t \\times (\\text{Expected Inflow at } t)}{(1+r)^t} - \\sum_{t} \\frac{s_t \\times (\\text{Expected Outflow at } t)}{(1+r)^t}\n$$\nWe compute this value from the perspective of time $t=0$. The annual discrete discount rate is $r=0.10$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the survival probabilities ($s_t$) for each cash flow event. The survival probability to a given time is the cumulative probability of successfully passing all preceding development phases.\n- The investment decision is made at $t=0$, so the Phase I cost is certain. The probability of this cash flow occurring is $s_0=1$.\n- The Phase II cost at $t=2$ is conditional on the success of Phase I. The survival probability to the start of Phase II is $s_2 = p_{\\text{I}} = 0.60$.\n- The Phase III cost at $t=5$ is conditional on the success of both Phase I and Phase II. Given independence, the survival probability is $s_5 = p_{\\text{I}} \\times p_{\\text{II}} = 0.60 \\times 0.35 = 0.21$.\n- The inflows at and after $t=9$ are conditional on success through all three phases (Phase I, II, and III). The survival probability to approval is $s_9 = p_{\\text{I}} \\times p_{\\text{II}} \\times p_{\\text{III}} = 0.60 \\times 0.35 \\times 0.60 = 0.126$.\n\nNext, we calculate the expected present value (EPV) of the cash outflows (costs). All costs are given in millions of USD.\nThe EPV of costs, denoted $EPV_{\\text{costs}}$, is:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{s_0 \\times C_{\\text{Phase I}}}{(1+r)^0} + \\frac{s_2 \\times C_{\\text{Phase II}}}{(1+r)^2} + \\frac{s_5 \\times C_{\\text{Phase III}}}{(1+r)^5}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10}{(1+0.10)^0} + \\frac{0.60 \\times 25}{(1+0.10)^2} + \\frac{0.21 \\times 80}{(1+0.10)^5}\n$$\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{costs}} = 10 + \\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} + \\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected present value (EPV) of the cash inflows (revenues). All revenues are in millions of USD.\nThe inflows consist of a one-time payment of $200$ at $t=9$ and a perpetual royalty stream of $30$ per year starting at $t=10$. Both are contingent on approval, which occurs at $t=9$ with probability $s_9=0.126$.\nFirst, we find the value of the perpetual royalty stream. The formula for the present value of a level perpetuity is $PV = \\frac{A}{r}$, where $A$ is the annual payment. This formula gives the value one period before the first payment. Since the first payment is at $t=10$, this formula gives the value at $t=9$.\nValue of the perpetuity at $t=9$, denoted $V_9$:\n$$\nV_9 = \\frac{30}{r} = \\frac{30}{0.10} = 300\n$$\nThe total cash value realized at $t=9$, conditional on approval, is the sum of the one-time payment and the value of the perpetuity: $200 + 300 = 500$.\nThe EPV of inflows, denoted $EPV_{\\text{inflows}}$, is the present value at $t=0$ of this total amount, weighted by the probability of approval:\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{inflows}} = \\frac{s_9 \\times (200 + V_9)}{(1+r)^9} = \\frac{0.126 \\times (200+300)}{(1+0.10)^9}\n$$\n$$\nEPV_{\\text{inflows}} = \\frac{0.126 \\times 500}{(1.1)^9} = \\frac{63}{(1.1)^9}\n$$\n\nFinally, the rNPV is the difference between the EPV of inflows and the EPV of outflows:\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} = EPV_{\\text{inflows}} - EPV_{\\text{costs}} = \\frac{63}{(1.1)^9} - \\left( 10 + \\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} + \\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{63}{(1.1)^9} \\approx \\frac{63}{2.35794769} \\approx 26.71803\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{15}{(1.1)^2} = \\frac{15}{1.21} \\approx 12.39669\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{16.8}{(1.1)^5} = \\frac{16.8}{1.61051} \\approx 10.43149\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the rNPV equation:\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx 26.71803 - (10 + 12.39669 + 10.43149)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx 26.71803 - 32.82818\n$$\n$$\n\\text{rNPV} \\approx -6.11015\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures. The value $-6.11015$ rounded to four significant figures is $-6.110$. The result is in millions of United States dollars (MUSD).",
