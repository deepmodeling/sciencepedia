            "introduction": "A cornerstone of modern phage therapy is the use of \"cocktails\" containing multiple distinct phages to overcome the challenge of bacterial resistance. By targeting several different surface receptors on the pathogen, a well-designed cocktail can significantly increase the likelihood that any given bacterium will be susceptible to at least one phage. This exercise  provides a hands-on application of probability theory to quantify the expected \"coverage\" of a phage cocktail across a pathogen population, a critical calculation in the rational design of effective therapies.",

            "problem": "A translational medicine team is designing a bacteriophage therapy cocktail for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The goal is to maximize the fraction of the pathogen population that is susceptible to at least one of the phages in the cocktail. Each phage in the cocktail binds a distinct cell-surface receptor: capsule K-antigen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core, outer membrane porin OmpK35, Type 1 fimbriae, and an O-acetylated exopolysaccharide. Single-cell phenotyping and multi-omics profiling in the intended clinical milieu indicate that the receptor phenotypes are orthogonal in their regulation and expression, and thus can be modeled as independent at the single-cell level. The measured prevalence of each receptor phenotype in the bacterial population is $p_1 = 0.62$, $p_2 = 0.41$, $p_3 = 0.27$, $p_4 = 0.33$, and $p_5 = 0.15$. The multiplicity of infection (MOI) is maintained sufficiently high so that a bacterium expressing any one of the targeted receptors is effectively killed by at least one cognate phage, and there is no cross-interference among phages.\n\nStarting from the foundational rules of probability (definitions of event independence, union, and complement), derive an expression for the expected coverage of the pathogen population by the cocktail, defined as the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium expresses at least one of the targeted receptors. Then compute its numerical value using the given receptor prevalences. Express the final expected coverage as a decimal fraction, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let $E_i$ be the event that a randomly chosen bacterium expresses receptor $i$, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The problem provides the prevalences of these receptor phenotypes, which correspond to the probabilities of these events:\n$P(E_1) = p_1 = 0.62$\n$P(E_2) = p_2 = 0.41$\n$P(E_3) = p_3 = 0.27$\n$P(E_4) = p_4 = 0.33$\n$P(E_5) = p_5 = 0.15$\n\nThe problem states that the expression of these receptors can be modeled as independent events. This is a critical piece of information. The \"expected coverage\" is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen bacterium expresses at least one of the targeted receptors. In the language of probability, this is the probability of the union of the events $E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4, E_5$. Let us denote this event as $C_{coverage}$.\n$$C_{coverage} = E_1 \\cup E_2 \\cup E_3 \\cup E_4 \\cup E_5$$\nWe are tasked with finding $P(C_{coverage})$.\n\nCalculating the probability of a union of multiple events directly using the principle of inclusion-exclusion is cumbersome. For $N$ events, the formula is:\n$$P(\\cup_{i=1}^N E_i) = \\sum_i P(E_i) - \\sum_{i<j} P(E_i \\cap E_j) + \\sum_{i<j<k} P(E_i \\cap E_j \\cap E_k) - \\dots + (-1)^{N-1} P(\\cap_{i=1}^N E_i)$$\nA more direct and computationally simpler approach is to use the complement rule. Let $C'_{coverage}$ be the complement of $C_{coverage}$. This represents the event that a randomly chosen bacterium expresses *none* of the five targeted receptors. That is, the bacterium does not express receptor $1$ AND does not express receptor $2$ AND so on.\nThe complement of the event $E_i$ is $E'_i$, which signifies that the bacterium does not express receptor $i$. Thus, we can write $C'_{coverage}$ as the intersection of these complement events:\n$$C'_{coverage} = E'_1 \\cap E'_2 \\cap E'_3 \\cap E'_4 \\cap E'_5$$\nThe fundamental rule of complements states that the probability of an event is $1$ minus the probability of its complement:\n$$P(C_{coverage}) = 1 - P(C'_{coverage})$$\nTo find $P(C'_{coverage})$, we must calculate $P(E'_1 \\cap E'_2 \\cap E'_3 \\cap E'_4 \\cap E'_5)$.\nA foundational theorem in probability states that if a set of events $\\{E_1, E_2, \\dots, E_N\\}$ is mutually independent, then their complements $\\{E'_1, E'_2, \\dots, E'_N\\}$ are also mutually independent. Since the problem specifies that the events $E_i$ are independent, we can conclude that the events $E'_i$ are also independent.\nFor independent events, the probability of their intersection is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = P(E'_1) \\times P(E'_2) \\times P(E'_3) \\times P(E'_4) \\times P(E'_5)$$\nThe probability of the complement of an event $E_i$ is given by $P(E'_i) = 1 - P(E_i) = 1 - p_i$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(C'_{coverage})$:\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = (1 - p_1)(1 - p_2)(1 - p_3)(1 - p_4)(1 - p_5)$$\nThis can be written compactly using product notation:\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5} (1 - p_i)$$\nFinally, substituting this back into the formula for $P(C_{coverage})$, we derive the general expression for the expected coverage:\n$$P(C_{coverage}) = 1 - \\prod_{i=1}^{5} (1 - p_i)$$\nThis is the expression for the expected coverage, derived from the foundational rules of probability. Now, we compute its numerical value.\n\nFirst, calculate the probabilities of non-expression, $(1 - p_i)$:\n$1 - p_1 = 1 - 0.62 = 0.38$\n$1 - p_2 = 1 - 0.41 = 0.59$\n$1 - p_3 = 1 - 0.27 = 0.73$\n$1 - p_4 = 1 - 0.33 = 0.67$\n$1 - p_5 = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n\nNext, calculate the product, which is the probability $P(C'_{coverage})$ that a bacterium is resistant to the entire cocktail:\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = 0.38 \\times 0.59 \\times 0.73 \\times 0.67 \\times 0.85$$\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = (0.2242) \\times 0.73 \\times 0.67 \\times 0.85$$\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = (0.163666) \\times 0.67 \\times 0.85$$\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = (0.10965622) \\times 0.85$$\n$$P(C'_{coverage}) = 0.093207787$$\n\nFinally, calculate the expected coverage $P(C_{coverage})$:\n$$P(C_{coverage}) = 1 - P(C'_{coverage}) = 1 - 0.093207787 = 0.906792213$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 0, 6, 7$. The fifth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$P(C_{coverage}) \\approx 0.9068$$\nThe expected coverage of the pathogen population by the cocktail is approximately $0.9068$.",

            "problem": "An interdisciplinary translational medicine team is preparing an intravenous administration of a bacteriophage cocktail for a patient with acute bloodstream infection. The immediate therapeutic goal is to achieve, at $t=0^{+}$ after infusion and instantaneous mixing, a post-clearance phage concentration $C^{*}$ in the central circulating compartment sufficient to exceed a required phage-to-bacterium ratio for rapid lysis. The following are established from first principles and measurements:\n\n- The definition of Multiplicity of Infection (MOI) states that the ratio of phage to bacteria within a unit volume is the multiplicity of infection. Denote the required multiplicity of infection for rapid lysis in whole blood by $\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n- The patient’s circulating bacterial load is estimated at $B = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}$ colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL).\n- The minimum effective multiplicity of infection determined from in vitro whole-blood kill curves and adjusted for in vivo conditions is $\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 12$.\n- The central compartment (accessible plasma volume for phage at $t=0^{+}$) is $V = 3.0~\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Due to preexisting innate and adaptive factors (e.g., complement and phagocytes), an immediate fraction $f = 0.55$ of infused particles is cleared prior to establishing the well-mixed post-infusion concentration.\n\nAssume a single-compartment, instantaneous mixing model at $t=0^{+}$, and use conservation of mass together with the definition of multiplicity of infection to derive the expression for the total infused dose $D$ (in plaque-forming units) that ensures the post-clearance concentration equals the target $C^{*}$ implied by the required multiplicity of infection.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the total infused bacteriophage dose, $D$, and the calculation of its numerical value. This will be accomplished by following the principles of conservation of mass and the definition of multiplicity of infection (MOI) within a single-compartment model.\n\nFirst, we must determine the target phage concentration, $C^{*}$, required in the central compartment immediately after infusion and clearance. The problem defines the effective multiplicity of infection, $\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, as the ratio of the phage concentration to the bacterial concentration. The bacterial concentration is given as $B$.

This is given by the product of the concentration and the volume:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = C^{*} \\cdot V\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C^{*}$ from the previous step, we get:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = (\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot B) \\cdot V\n$$\n\nThird, we must account for the initial, rapid clearance of a fraction of the infused dose. The problem states that a fraction $f$ of the total infused dose $D$ is cleared immediately. Therefore, the fraction of the dose that remains to establish the therapeutic concentration is $(1-f)$. The number of effective phage particles, $N_{\\text{eff}}$, is this remaining fraction of the total dose $D$:\n$$\nN_{\\text{eff}} = D \\cdot (1 - f)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the symbolic expression for $D$ by equating the two expressions for $N_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nD \\cdot (1 - f) = \\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot B \\cdot V\n$$\nSolving for the total infused dose $D$, we obtain the final analytical expression:\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\cdot B \\cdot V}{1 - f}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $D$ using the provided data:\n- $\\text{MOI}_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 12$ (dimensionless)\n- $B = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}~\\text{CFU/mL}$\n- $V = 3.0~\\mathrm{L}$\n- $f = 0.55$ (dimensionless)\n\nIt is critical to ensure consistency of units.
