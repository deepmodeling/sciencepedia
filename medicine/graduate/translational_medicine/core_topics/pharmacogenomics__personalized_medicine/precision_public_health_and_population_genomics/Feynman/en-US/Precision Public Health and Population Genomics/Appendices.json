The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle serves as a fundamental null model, describing the expected genotype frequencies from known allele frequencies under conditions of random mating and the absence of evolutionary influences.

In a random sample of $N=1000$ unrelated adults from a genetically diverse urban population, high-quality genotyping yields the following observed genotype counts for alleles $A$ and $a$: $AA=400$, $Aa=400$, and $aa=200$. Assume all individuals are unrelated and that genotyping error is negligible. Using population genetics fundamentals—allele frequency definitions in a diploid population and the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) principle derived from random mating and Mendelian inheritance—compute the allele frequencies $p$ for allele $A$ and $q$ for allele $a$, the expected genotype counts under HWE, and the Pearson chi-square goodness-of-fit statistic for deviation from HWE. Treat the allele frequency as estimated from the sample, and therefore use the appropriate degrees of freedom for the test. Report the chi-square test statistic as your final numeric answer, rounded to four significant figures. No units are required.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The context of pharmacogenomics and the `VKORC1` gene is a standard and appropriate example in translational medicine. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Pearson chi-square ($\\chi^2$) goodness-of-fit statistic to test whether the observed genotype counts for a specific SNP conform to the expectations of Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The solution involves three primary steps:\n1.  Calculate the allele frequencies from the observed genotype counts.\n2.  Use these allele frequencies to calculate the expected genotype counts under HWE.\n3.  Compute the $\\chi^2$ statistic using the observed and expected counts.\n\nThe given observed genotype counts from a sample of $N=1000$ individuals are:\n-   Number of individuals with genotype $AA$: $N_{AA} = 400$\n-   Number of individuals with genotype $Aa$: $N_{Aa} = 400$\n-   Number of individuals with genotype $aa$: $N_{aa} = 200$\n\nThe total number of individuals in the sample is $N = N_{AA} + N_{Aa} + N_{aa} = 400 + 400 + 200 = 1000$, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate allele frequencies**\nThe frequencies of the alleles $A$ and $a$, denoted by $p$ and $q$ respectively, are calculated from the observed counts. In a diploid population of size $N$, there are $2N$ total alleles.\nThe total number of $A$ alleles is twice the number of $AA$ homozygotes plus the number of $Aa$ heterozygotes.\n$$ \\text{Count}(A) = (2 \\times N_{AA}) + N_{Aa} = (2 \\times 400) + 400 = 800 + 400 = 1200 $$\nThe total number of $a$ alleles is twice the number of $aa$ homozygotes plus the number of $Aa$ heterozygotes.\n$$ \\text{Count}(a) = (2 \\times N_{aa}) + N_{Aa} = (2 \\times 200) + 400 = 400 + 400 = 800 $$\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is $2N = 2 \\times 1000 = 2000$. As a check, $\\text{Count}(A) + \\text{Count}(a) = 1200 + 800 = 2000$, which is correct.\n\nThe frequency $p$ of allele $A$ is:\n$$ p = \\frac{\\text{Count}(A)}{2N} = \\frac{1200}{2000} = 0.6 $$\nThe frequency $q$ of allele $a$ is:\n$$ q = \\frac{\\text{Count}(a)}{2N} = \\frac{800}{2000} = 0.4 $$\nAs required, the sum of allele frequencies is $p + q = 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate expected genotype counts under HWE**\nThe Hardy-Weinberg principle states that for a population in equilibrium, the expected genotype frequencies are given by $p^2$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^2$ for $aa$.\nThe expected frequencies are:\n-   Expected frequency of $AA$: $f_{exp}(AA) = p^2 = (0.6)^2 = 0.36$\n-   Expected frequency of $Aa$: $f_{exp}(Aa) = 2pq = 2(0.6)(0.4) = 0.48$\n-   Expected frequency of $aa$: $f_{exp}(aa) = q^2 = (0.4)^2 = 0.16$\nThe sum of expected frequencies is $0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0$.\n\nTo find the expected counts, we multiply these frequencies by the total sample size, $N=1000$:\n-   Expected count of $AA$: $E_{AA} = p^2 N = 0.36 \\times 1000 = 360$\n-   Expected count of $Aa$: $E_{Aa} = 2pq N = 0.48 \\times 1000 = 480$\n-   Expected count of $aa$: $E_{aa} = q^2 N = 0.16 \\times 1000 = 160$\nThe sum of expected counts is $360 + 480 + 160 = 1000$, which matches the sample size.\n\n**Step 3: Compute the Pearson chi-square statistic**\nThe $\\chi^2$ statistic is calculated using the formula:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} $$\nwhere $O_i$ are the observed counts and $E_i$ are the expected counts for each genotype category $i$.\n\nWe have the following observed ($O$) and expected ($E$) counts:\n-   Genotype $AA$: $O_{AA} = 400$, $E_{AA} = 360$\n-   Genotype $Aa$: $O_{Aa} = 400$, $E_{Aa} = 480$\n-   Genotype $aa$: $O_{aa} = 200$, $E_{aa} = 160$\n\nNow, we compute the $\\chi^2$ value:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(O_{AA} - E_{AA})^2}{E_{AA}} + \\frac{(O_{Aa} - E_{Aa})^2}{E_{Aa}} + \\frac{(O_{aa} - E_{aa})^2}{E_{aa}} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(400 - 360)^2}{360} + \\frac{(400 - 480)^2}{480} + \\frac{(200 - 160)^2}{160} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{(40)^2}{360} + \\frac{(-80)^2}{480} + \\frac{(40)^2}{160} $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{1600}{360} + \\frac{6400}{480} + \\frac{1600}{160} $$\nLet's simplify the fractions:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{160}{36} + \\frac{640}{48} + 10 $$\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{40}{9} + \\frac{40}{3} + 10 $$\nTo sum these values, we find a common denominator, which is $9$:\n$$ \\chi^2 = \\frac{40}{9} + \\frac{120}{9} + \\frac{90}{9} = \\frac{40 + 120 + 90}{9} = \\frac{250}{9} $$\nConverting the fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\chi^2 = 27.777... $$\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\chi^2 \\approx 27.78 $$\nThe degrees of freedom ($df$) for this test are given by the number of categories minus $1$, minus the number of independent parameters estimated from the data. We have $3$ genotype categories ($AA$, $Aa$, $aa$). We estimated one parameter, the allele frequency $p$ (since $q=1-p$). Therefore, the degrees of freedom are $df = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$. The calculated $\\chi^2$ value of approximately $27.78$ with $1$ degree of freedom indicates a highly significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.",

The population prevalence of the disorder, $K$, is the prior probability of having the disease: $P(D) = K = 0.001$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disease: $P(+ \\mid D) = 0.95$.\n3.

No flaws are identified. The problem is valid.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution, starting from first principles.\nThe liability-threshold model posits an underlying, unobserved continuous variable called liability, $L$. An individual is affected with the disease if their liability exceeds a certain threshold, $t$. The liability $L$ is assumed to be the sum of a genetic component $A$ (the additive genetic value or breeding value) and a residual component $R$ (encompassing non-additive genetic effects and environmental factors), such that $L = A + R$. We assume $A$ and $R$ are independent. The components are typically modeled as normally distributed variables with mean $0$. By convention, the liability scale is standardized so that $\\text{Var}(L) = 1$.\n$$ \\text{Var}(L) = \\text{Var}(A) + \\text{Var}(R) = 1 $$\nThe narrow-sense heritability on the liability scale, $h^{2}_{L}$, is the proportion of the total variance in liability that is due to additive genetic factors.\n$$ h^{2}_{L} = \\frac{\\text{Var}(A)}{\\text{Var}(L)} = \\frac{\\text{Var}(A)}{1} = \\text{Var}(A) $$\nThe disease status, $Y$, is a binary variable: $Y=1$ if affected ($L>t$) and $Y=0$ if unaffected ($L \\leq t$). The expected value of $Y$ is the disease prevalence, $\\mathbb{E}[Y] = 1 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(Y=1) + 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}(Y=0) = \\mathbb{P}(L>t) = K$. The variance of this binary trait on the observed scale is $\\text{Var}(Y) = K(1-K)$.\n\nThe heritability on the observed (0-1) scale, $h^{2}_{O}$, is the proportion of variance in $Y$ that is explained by the additive genetic value $A$. This can be expressed as the squared correlation between $Y$ and $A$.\n$$ h^{2}_{O} = (\\text{corr}(Y, A))^{2} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Cov}(Y,A)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(Y)\\text{Var}(A)}} \\right)^{2} $$\nTo derive the relationship between $h^{2}_{L}$ and $h^{2}_{O}$, we must find an expression for $\\text{Cov}(Y,A)$. We assume $A$ and $L$ are jointly normally distributed. The covariance is given by $\\text{Cov}(Y,A) = \\mathbb{E}[YA] - \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\mathbb{E}[A]$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[A]=0$, this simplifies to $\\text{Cov}(Y,A) = \\mathbb{E}[YA]$.\nUsing the law of total expectation: $\\mathbb{E}[YA] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[YA|L]] = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\mathbb{E}[A|L]]$.\nSince $A$ and $L$ are jointly normal, the regression of $A$ on $L$ is linear:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[A|L] = \\mathbb{E}[A] + \\frac{\\text{Cov}(A,L)}{\\text{Var}(L)}(L - \\mathbb{E}[L]) $$\nWith $\\mathbb{E}[A]=0$, $\\mathbb{E}[L]=0$, and $\\text{Var}(L)=1$, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}[A|L] = \\text{Cov}(A,L) \\cdot L$.\nFurthermore, $\\text{Cov}(A,L) = \\text{Cov}(A, A+R) = \\text{Cov}(A,A) + \\text{Cov}(A,R) = \\text{Var}(A) + 0 = h^{2}_{L}$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{E}[A|L] = h^{2}_{L} \\cdot L$.\nSubstituting this back into the covariance expression:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(Y,A) = \\mathbb{E}[Y \\cdot (h^{2}_{L} \\cdot L)] = h^{2}_{L} \\mathbb{E}[YL] $$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[YL]$ is the covariance between the observed phenotype and liability, $\\text{Cov}(Y,L)$, since $\\mathbb{E}[L]=0$. We can compute it directly:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[YL] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} y(l) \\cdot l \\cdot \\varphi(l) dl $$\nwhere $y(l) = 1$ if $l > t$ and $y(l)=0$ otherwise.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[YL] = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} l \\cdot \\varphi(l) dl = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} l \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{l^2}{2}\\right) dl $$\nThis integral can be solved by recognizing that the derivative of $\\exp(-l^2/2)$ with respect to $l$ is $-l\\exp(-l^2/2)$.\n$$ \\int_{t}^{\\infty} l \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{l^2}{2}\\right) dl = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{l^2}{2}\\right) \\right]_{t}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\left( 0 - \\left(-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right) = \\varphi(t) $$\nBy definition, $z = \\varphi(t)$. So, $\\text{Cov}(Y,L) = z$.\nTherefore, $\\text{Cov}(Y,A) = h^{2}_{L} \\cdot z$.\nNow substitute all the pieces back into the formula for $h^{2}_{O}$:\n$$ h^{2}_{O} = \\left( \\frac{h^{2}_{L} z}{\\sqrt{K(1-K) \\cdot h^{2}_{L}}} \\right)^{2} = \\frac{(h^{2}_{L})^2 z^2}{K(1-K) h^{2}_{L}} = h^{2}_{L} \\frac{z^2}{K(1-K)} $$\nThis is the desired expression linking the two heritabilities. To find $h^{2}_{L}$, we rearrange the formula:\n$$ h^{2}_{L} = h^{2}_{O} \\frac{K(1-K)}{z^2} $$\nWe are given $h^{2}_{O} = 0.05$ and $K = 0.1$. We need to calculate $z$.\nThe threshold $t$ is given by $t = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - K) = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.1) = \\Phi^{-1}(0.9)$.\nUsing standard statistical software or tables, the value of the 90th percentile of the standard normal distribution is $t \\approx 1.28155$.\nNext, we calculate $z = \\varphi(t)$, which is the height of the standard normal PDF at $t$:\n$$ z = \\varphi(1.28155) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1.28155)^2}{2}\\right) \\approx 0.17550 $$\nNow we can compute the scaling factor:\n$$ \\frac{K(1-K)}{z^2} = \\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{(0.17550)^2} = \\frac{0.09}{0.03080025} \\approx 2.92206 $$\nFinally, we compute $h^{2}_{L}$:\n$$ h^{2}_{L} = 0.05 \\times 2.92206 \\approx 0.146103 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $h^{2}_{L} = 0.1461$.\n\nRegarding the translational implications:\nThe transformation shows that the liability-scale heritability ($h^{2}_{L} \\approx 0.146$) is nearly three times larger than the observed-scale heritability ($h^{2}_{O} = 0.05$). This is a critical insight for precision public health. The parameter $h^{2}_{L}$ is the more meaningful quantity, as it represents the proportion of variance in the underlying predisposition to the disease that is attributable to the measured SNPs. A heritability of approximately $14.6\\%$ is moderate but substantial, suggesting that polygenic risk scores (PRS) constructed from these SNPs have the potential to be a useful tool for risk stratification in the population. For instance, individuals at the high end of the PRS distribution may have a clinically meaningful increase in risk, warranting earlier or more intensive screening. However, the fact that $h^{2}_{L}$ is far from $1$ also powerfully illustrates that a large fraction of risk variation ($~85.4\\%$) is not captured by these common variants, and is due to environmental, lifestyle, or other genetic factors. Therefore, for effective genetic risk prediction at the individual level, PRS must be integrated into a comprehensive model that includes other non-genetic risk factors, rather than being used as a sole predictor. The value of $h^{2}_{L}$ quantifies the theoretical upper limit of predictive accuracy achievable using only the additive effects of the SNPs under study.",
