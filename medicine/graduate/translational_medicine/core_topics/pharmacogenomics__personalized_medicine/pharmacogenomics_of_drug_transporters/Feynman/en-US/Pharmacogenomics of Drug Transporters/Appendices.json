In a large, well-mixed adult cohort without obvious stratification, the observed genotype frequencies for rs4149056 are: homozygous reference $T/T$: $0.64$, heterozygous $T/C$: $0.32$, and homozygous variant $C/C$: $0.04$.

By definition of allele frequency via allele counting in a diploid population, the frequency of allele $T$, denoted $p$, equals the total fraction of $T$ alleles among chromosomes. Each $T/T$ genotype contributes two $T$ alleles, each $T/C$ genotype contributes one $T$ allele, and each $C/C$ genotype contributes zero $T$ alleles. Because genotype frequencies sum to one and each individual has two alleles, the allele frequency $p$ is computed by\n$$\np \\;=\\; f_{TT} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\;+\\; f_{TC} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\;+\\; f_{CC} \\cdot 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2},\n$$\nwhich simplifies to the standard allele counting identity\n$$\np \\;=\\; f_{TT} \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2} f_{TC}.\n$$\nSubstituting the observed frequencies gives\n$$\np \\;=\\; 0.64 \\;+\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 0.32 \\;=\\; 0.64 \\;+\\; 0.16 \\;=\\; 0.80.\n$$\nBecause there are only two alleles, by the definition of allele frequencies we have $p + q = 1$, where $q$ is the frequency of allele $C$.

If the population is in such an equilibrium, the genotype frequencies are determined entirely by $p$ and $q$ in a way that yields a specific mapping from allele frequencies to genotype frequencies. Using the derived $p = 0.80$ and $q = 0.20$, the implied genotype frequencies are:\n- The frequency of homozygous $T/T$ equals the value determined by $p$ alone, which yields $0.80$ combined per-allele contribution twice, giving\n$$\n\\text{implied } f_{TT} = (0.80)^2 = 0.64.\n$$\n- The frequency of heterozygous $T/C$ reflects the combination of one $T$ and one $C$ allele under random union, giving\n$$\n\\text{implied } f_{TC} = 2 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 0.20 = 0.32.\n$$\n- The frequency of homozygous $C/C$ equals the value determined by $q$ alone applied twice, giving\n$$\n\\text{implied } f_{CC} = (0.20)^2 = 0.04.\n$$\n\nThese implied frequencies match the observed frequencies exactly: $0.64$, $0.32$, and $0.04$. Under the instruction to ignore sampling variance and treat the given frequencies as population values, this exact concordance indicates that the observed distribution is consistent with the equilibrium condition as defined in the problem.

            "introduction": "A central goal of pharmacogenomics is to predict how a genetic variant will alter an individual's response to a drug. This practice focuses on translating a known change in transporter function—modeled as a reduction in hepatic clearance—into quantitative changes in drug exposure.

A common Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) in *SLCO1B1*, rs4149056, reduces hepatic uptake and thereby lowers hepatic clearance.

            "solution": "The solution is derived in two parts as requested: the fold-increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and the fold-change in the peak plasma concentration ($C_{\\max}$).\n\n**Part 1: Fold-Increase in AUC**\n\nThe total systemic clearance ($CL$) of a drug is defined as the proportionality constant relating the rate of elimination to the plasma concentration. For a single dose $D$ with systemic bioavailability $F$, the total amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is $F \\cdot D$. The clearance is related to the total drug exposure, represented by the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time $0$ to infinity ($AUC_{0-\\infty}$, hereafter denoted as $AUC$), by the fundamental pharmacokinetic equation:\n$$CL = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{AUC}$$\nThis can be rearranged to express $AUC$ as a function of dose and clearance:\n$$AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}$$\nThe problem states that the total systemic clearance is equal to the hepatic clearance, $CL = CL_H$. We are given two scenarios: a wild-type (WT) individual and a variant (V) individual with the rs4149056 SNP. The corresponding hepatic clearances are given as $CL_{H,WT} = 30\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$ and $CL_{H,V} = 18\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$. The dose $D$ and bioavailability $F$ are assumed to be unchanged by genotype.\n\nWe can write the $AUC$ for each genotype:\n$$AUC_{WT} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{WT}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{H,WT}}$$\n$$AUC_{V} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{V}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{H,V}}$$\nThe fold-increase in $AUC$ for the variant genotype relative to the wild-type is the ratio $\\frac{AUC_{V}}{AUC_{WT}}$:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{V}}{AUC_{WT}} = \\frac{\\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{H,V}}}{\\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL_{H,WT}}} = \\frac{CL_{H,WT}}{CL_{H,V}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{V}}{AUC_{WT}} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{18\\,\\mathrm{L/h}} = \\frac{30}{18} = \\frac{5}{3}$$\nConverting to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{AUC_{V}}{AUC_{WT}} \\approx 1.6666... \\approx 1.667$$\n\n**Part 2: Fold-Change in Peak Concentration ($C_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe problem specifies a one-compartment body model with first-order absorption and linear (first-order) elimination. Let $A(t)$ be the amount of drug at the absorption site and $X(t)$ be the amount of drug in the central compartment. The system is described by the following mass-balance differential equations:\n$$\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_a A(t)$$\n$$\\frac{dX(t)}{dt} = k_a A(t) - k_e X(t)$$\nwhere $k_a$ is the first-order absorption rate constant and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The initial conditions are $A(0) = F \\cdot D$ and $X(0) = 0$.\n\nThe solution to this system of equations gives the plasma concentration $C(t) = \\frac{X(t)}{V}$, where $V$ is the volume of distribution:\n$$C(t) = \\frac{F \\cdot D \\cdot k_a}{V(k_e - k_a)} (\\exp(-k_a t) - \\exp(-k_e t))$$\nThe peak concentration, $C_{\\max}$, occurs at time $t_{\\max}$, which is found by setting the derivative of $C(t)$ with respect to time to zero, $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. This yields:\n$$k_a \\exp(-k_a t_{\\max}) = k_e \\exp(-k_e t_{\\max})$$\nSolving for $t_{\\max}$:\n$$t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\ln(k_e / k_a)}{k_e - k_a}$$\n$C_{\\max}$ is the concentration $C(t)$ evaluated at $t=t_{\\max}$. Substituting the expression for $t_{\\max}$ into the equation for $C(t)$ gives several equivalent forms for $C_{\\max}$. One of the most convenient forms is:\n$$C_{\\max} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{V} \\exp(-k_e t_{\\max})$$\nThe problem states that $F$, $D$, $V$, and $k_a$ are constant across genotypes. The change in clearance $CL$ affects the elimination rate constant $k_e$, since $k_e = \\frac{CL}{V}$.\n\nLet's calculate the values for $k_e$ and $t_{\\max}$ for both genotypes.\nThe given parameters are $V = 200\\,\\mathrm{L}$ and $k_a = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$.\n\nFor the wild-type (WT) genotype:\n$CL_{WT} = 30\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n$k_{e,WT} = \\frac{CL_{WT}}{V} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{200\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$\n$t_{\\max,WT} = \\frac{\\ln(k_{e,WT} / k_a)}{k_{e,WT} - k_a} = \\frac{\\ln(0.15 / 1.0)}{0.15 - 1.0} = \\frac{\\ln(0.15)}{-0.85}\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\nFor the variant (V) genotype:\n$CL_{V} = 18\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$\n$k_{e,V} = \\frac{CL_{V}}{V} = \\frac{18\\,\\mathrm{L/h}}{200\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.09\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}}$\n$t_{\\max,V} = \\frac{\\ln(k_{e,V} / k_a)}{k_{e,V} - k_a} = \\frac{\\ln(0.09 / 1.0)}{0.09 - 1.0} = \\frac{\\ln(0.09)}{-0.91}\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\nThe fold-change in $C_{\\max}$ is the ratio $\\frac{C_{\\max,V}}{C_{\\max,WT}}$. The term $\\frac{F \\cdot D}{V}$ is constant and cancels out.\n$$\\frac{C_{\\max,V}}{C_{\\max,WT}} = \\frac{\\exp(-k_{e,V} \\cdot t_{\\max,V})}{\\exp(-k_{e,WT} \\cdot t_{\\max,WT})}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$t_{\\max,WT} \\approx \\frac{-1.89712}{-0.85} \\approx 2.23191\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n$$t_{\\max,V} \\approx \\frac{-2.40795}{-0.91} \\approx 2.64609\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nThe exponents are:\nExponent for WT: $-k_{e,WT} \\cdot t_{\\max,WT} = -0.15\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln(0.15)}{-0.85}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{h} \\approx -0.334786$\nExponent for V: $-k_{e,V} \\cdot t_{\\max,V} = -0.09\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\ln(0.09)}{-0.91}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{h} \\approx -0.238148$\n\nThe ratio is then:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\max,V}}{C_{\\max,WT}} = \\frac{\\exp(-0.238148)}{\\exp(-0.334786)} \\approx \\frac{0.788088}{0.715515} \\approx 1.101426$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the fold-change in $C_{\\max}$ is $1.101$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix of the two calculated values: the AUC fold-increase and the $C_{\\max}$ fold-change, both rounded to four significant figures.\nAUC fold-increase: $1.667$\n$C_{\\max}$ fold-change: $1.101$",
