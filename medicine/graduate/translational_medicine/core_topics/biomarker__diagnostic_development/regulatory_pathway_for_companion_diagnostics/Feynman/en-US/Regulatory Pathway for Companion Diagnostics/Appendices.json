In a pivotal translational study informing the regulatory pathway, the biomarker value is modeled as a continuous variable, and the clinical decision rule declares a patient as test-positive if the biomarker value is at or above a threshold $t$. The intended use specifies identifying patients with a true targetable biology (disease-positive) to receive the therapy. Let the biomarker distribution in the disease-positive subgroup be Gaussian with mean $\\mu_{1}$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$, and in the disease-negative subgroup be Gaussian with mean $\\mu_{0}$ and the same variance $\\sigma^{2}$, where $\\mu_{1}>\\mu_{0}$ and $\\sigma>0$. Sensitivity is defined as $S(t)=\\mathbb{P}(X\\geq t\\mid \\text{disease-positive})$ and specificity as $\\operatorname{Sp}(t)=\\mathbb{P}(X<t\\mid \\text{disease-negative})$. The Youden index is defined as $J(t)=S(t)+\\operatorname{Sp}(t)-1$. Assume a population prevalence $\\pi\\in(0,1)$ of disease-positive status to evaluate operating characteristics. Using only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Gaussian probability, and without invoking any unproven shortcuts, derive the threshold $t^{\\star}$ that maximizes $J(t)$ under these assumptions. Then, using the same base, express the resulting $S(t^{\\star})$, $\\operatorname{Sp}(t^{\\star})$, $J(t^{\\star})$, the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) defined as $\\operatorname{PPV}(t)=\\frac{\\pi S(t)}{\\pi S(t)+(1-\\pi)(1-\\operatorname{Sp}(t))}$, and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) defined as $\\operatorname{NPV}(t)=\\frac{(1-\\pi)\\operatorname{Sp}(t)}{(1-\\pi)\\operatorname{Sp}(t)+\\pi(1-S(t))}$, all evaluated at $t^{\\star}$.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\nLet us define the following events:\n- $R$: The event that a patient is a true responder to the therapy.\n- $R^c$: The event that a patient is a true non-responder to the therapy.\n- $T^+$: The event that the diagnostic test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the diagnostic test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- The prevalence of true responders: $P(R) = 0.30$.\n- The prevalence of true non-responders is therefore $P(R^c) = 1 - P(R) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n- The sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given the patient is a true responder: $P(T^+ | R) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given the patient is a true non-responder: $P(T^- | R^c) = 0.90$.\n\nWe are asked to derive expressions for and compute the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n- PPV is the probability that a patient is a true responder given a positive test result: $PPV = P(R | T^+)$.\n- NPV is the probability that a patient is a true non-responder given a negative test result: $NPV = P(R^c | T^-)$.\n\nThe derivation will begin from fundamental theorems as required.\n\n**1. Core Definitions and Theorems**\n- **Conditional Probability:** For two events $A$ and $B$, $P(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$, provided $P(B) > 0$. This can be rearranged to $P(A \\cap B) = P(A | B) P(B)$.\n- **Bayes' Theorem:** By symmetry, $P(A \\cap B) = P(B | A) P(A)$. Equating the two expressions for $P(A \\cap B)$ and rearranging gives Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n- **Law of Total Probability:** For any event $A$ and a partition of the sample space $\\{B_i\\}$, $P(A) = \\sum_i P(A \\cap B_i) = \\sum_i P(A | B_i) P(B_i)$. In our case, the patient population is partitioned into responders ($R$) and non-responders ($R^c$). Thus, for an event such as $T^+$, its probability is:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + P(T^+ | R^c) P(R^c)$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe PPV is $P(R | T^+)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(R | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | R) P(R)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + P(T^+ | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^+ | R)$ (sensitivity) and $P(R)$ (prevalence). We need $P(T^+ | R^c)$. This is the probability of a positive test in a non-responder, which is $1$ minus the specificity.\n$$P(T^+ | R^c) = 1 - P(T^- | R^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | R) P(R) + (1 - P(T^- | R^c)) P(R^c)$$\nFinally, substituting the full expression for $P(T^+)$ into the Bayes' theorem formulation for PPV yields the complete expression:\n$$PPV = \\frac{P(T^+ | R) P(R)}{P(T^+ | R) P(R) + (1 - P(T^- | R^c)) P(R^c)}$$\n\n**3. Derivation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe NPV is $P(R^c | T^-)$. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(R^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^-)$, we use the Law of Total Probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | R) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T^- | R^c)$ (specificity) and $P(R^c)$. We need $P(T^- | R)$. This is the probability of a negative test in a responder, which is $1$ minus the sensitivity.\n$$P(T^- | R) = 1 - P(T^+ | R) = 1 - \\text{sensitivity}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = (1 - P(T^+ | R)) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)$$\nFinally, substituting the full expression for $P(T^-)$ into the Bayes' theorem formulation for NPV yields the complete expression:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}{(1 - P(T^+ | R)) P(R) + P(T^- | R^c) P(R^c)}$$\n\n**4. Numerical Computation**\nUsing the given values:\n- $P(R) = 0.30$\n- $P(R^c) = 0.70$\n- $P(T^+ | R) = 0.85$\n- $P(T^- | R^c) = 0.90$\n\nWe can first calculate the terms needed for the denominators:\n- $1 - P(T^- | R^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$\n- $1 - P(T^+ | R) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n\n**Computation of PPV:**\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.85)(0.30)}{(0.85)(0.30) + (0.10)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.255}{0.255 + 0.070} = \\frac{0.255}{0.325} \\approx 0.78461538$$\nRounded to $4$ significant figures, $PPV = 0.7846$.\n\n**Computation of NPV:**\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.90)(0.70)}{(0.15)(0.30) + (0.90)(0.70)} = \\frac{0.63}{0.045 + 0.63} = \\frac{0.63}{0.675} \\approx 0.93333333$$\nRounded to $4$ significant figures, $NPV = 0.9333$.\n\n**5. Interpretation of Implications**\nThe calculated values provide critical insights into the clinical utility of the test and the proposed treatment strategy.\n- **Positive Predictive Value ($PPV = 0.7846$):** This value indicates that among patients who test positive, there is a $78.46\\%$ probability that they are indeed true responders. While this represents a significant enrichment from the baseline prevalence of $30\\%$, it also implies that $100\\% - 78.46\\% = 21.54\\%$ of test-positive individuals are false positives. Following the label's recommendation to treat all test-positive patients means that approximately $21.54\\%$ of treated patients will be exposed to the therapy's costs and potential toxicities without the likelihood of a clinically meaningful benefit.\n- **Negative Predictive Value ($NPV = 0.9333$):** This value is very high, indicating that among patients who test negative, there is a $93.33\\%$ probability that they are true non-responders. Following the label's recommendation to withhold therapy from test-negative patients means that the vast majority of these patients are correctly spared an ineffective treatment. However, it also implies that $100\\% - 93.33\\% = 6.67\\%$ of test-negative patients are false negatives. These patients, who would have likely benefited from the therapy, will be denied treatment.\n\n**Conclusion:** The test is highly effective for its \"rule-out\" function (a high NPV confidently identifies non-responders), which is valuable for avoiding unnecessary treatment. Its \"rule-in\" function (PPV) is moderately strong, substantially increasing the a priori probability of response but still leading to the treatment of a notable fraction of non-responders. The decision to approve and adopt this strategy depends on a careful assessment of the clinical context, including the severity of the disease, the magnitude of the therapeutic benefit for true responders, and the severity of the treatment's side effects and costs.",

            "solution": "The derivation proceeds from the foundational definitions of probability and expected value.\n\nLet $N$ be the size of the patient cohort.\nLet $f_p$ be the false-positive rate of the companion diagnostic. This is defined as the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the patient is truly biomarker-negative. We can write this as $P(\\text{Test Positive} \\mid \\text{Biomarker Negative}) = f_p$.\nLet $p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$ be the probability of a serious adverse event (SAE) for a truly biomarker-negative patient who is administered the drug. We write this as $P(\\text{SAE} \\mid \\text{Biomarker Negative, Drug Administered}) = p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$.\n\nThe problem establishes a specific scenario for analysis: the entire cohort of size $N$ is comprised of truly biomarker-negative patients. This is a modeling assumption to isolate the harm purely attributable to false positives.\n\nUnder this assumption, for any single patient selected from the cohort, their biomarker status is negative. The diagnostic test is applied to this patient. The outcome of the test is a random event. The probability that this patient tests positive is, by the definition of the false-positive rate, equal to $f_p$.\n\nLet us define a random variable $X_i$ for the $i$-th patient in the cohort, where $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$. Let $X_i = 1$ if patient $i$ tests positive and $X_i = 0$ if patient $i$ tests negative. Since each patient is biomarker-negative, the testing of each patient is a Bernoulli trial with a probability of \"success\" (a positive test) equal to $f_p$.\n$$P(X_i = 1) = f_p$$\n$$P(X_i = 0) = 1 - f_p$$\nThe expected value of this Bernoulli trial is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = f_p$.\n\nThe total number of patients who test positive in the cohort is the sum of these random variables: $X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of patients who test positive is:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} f_p = N \\cdot f_p$$\nThis is the expected number of patients who will receive a positive test result. According to the decision rule, these are the patients who will be administered the drug.\n\nNow, we must determine the expected number of serious adverse events (SAEs) among these treated patients. Each treated patient is, by the initial assumption of the scenario, biomarker-negative. For any such patient, the probability of experiencing an SAE is given as $p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$.\n\nLet $Y$ be the total number of SAEs in the cohort. We seek to find the expected value of $Y$, denoted $E[Y]$. We can use the law of total expectation. The number of SAEs depends on the number of patients who test positive, $X$.\n$$E[Y] = E[E[Y \\mid X]]$$\nGiven that $X=x$ patients test positive (and are therefore treated), the number of SAEs, $Y$, among these $x$ patients follows a binomial distribution with parameters $n=x$ and $p=p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$. The expected number of SAEs, conditional on $X=x$, is $E[Y \\mid X=x] = x \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$.\nTherefore, $E[Y \\mid X] = X \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the law of total expectation:\n$$E[Y] = E[X \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}]$$\nSince $p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$ is a constant, we can pull it out of the expectation:\n$$E[Y] = p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -} \\cdot E[X]$$\nWe have already derived that $E[X] = N \\cdot f_p$. Substituting this result gives the final expression for the expected number of SAEs:\n$$E[\\text{SAEs}] = (N \\cdot f_p) \\cdot p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -}$$\nThis formula represents the expected increase in serious adverse events attributable to false-positive results in a cohort of size $N$ that is entirely biomarker-negative.\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n$N = 1000$ tests\n$f_p = 0.02$\n$p_{\\mathrm{SAE}\\mid -} = 0.15$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$E[\\text{SAEs}] = 1000 \\cdot 0.02 \\cdot 0.15$$\nFirst, we calculate the expected number of patients who test positive:\n$$E[X] = 1000 \\cdot 0.02 = 20$$\nSo, on average, $20$ patients will test positive and be administered the drug.\nNext, we calculate the expected number of SAEs among these $20$ patients:\n$$E[\\text{SAEs}] = 20 \\cdot 0.15$$\n$$E[\\text{SAEs}] = 20 \\cdot \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{300}{100} = 3$$\nThus, the expected increase in serious adverse events per $1{,}000$ tests is $3$.
