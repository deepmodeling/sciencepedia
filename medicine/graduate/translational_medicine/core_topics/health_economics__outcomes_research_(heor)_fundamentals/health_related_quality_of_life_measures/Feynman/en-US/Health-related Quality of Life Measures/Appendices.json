            "problem": "A core aim in translational medicine is to link patient-centered outcomes to decision models in a way that preserves clinical meaning across laboratory, trial, and real-world settings. Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instruments such as the EuroQol Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) system encode a health state as a $5$-digit vector of levels across Mobility (MO), Self-Care (SC), Usual Activities (UA), Pain/Discomfort (PD), and Anxiety/Depression (AD), where level $1$ denotes no problems, level $2$ denotes some problems, and level $3$ denotes extreme problems. Cardinal utilities on the $[0,1]$ scale are anchored at $1$ for full health and $0$ for dead, with negative values allowed when a health state is valued as worse than dead.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base of anchored cardinal utility and the axioms of additive independence in Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), utilities for EQ-5D health states in a given country are estimated from Time Trade-Off (TTO) valuations as decrements from full health. Consider the United Kingdom (UK) tariff estimated using TTO, specified by an intercept decrement $d_{0}$, dimension- and level-specific decrements $d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(2)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(3)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(3)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(2)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(3)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(2)}$, $d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(3)}$, and an additional penalty coefficient $\\pi$ applied when any dimension is at level $3$. The UK coefficients are:\n$d_{0}=0.081$,\n$d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(2)}=0.069$, $d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(3)}=0.314$,\n$d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)}=0.104$, $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(3)}=0.214$,\n$d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(2)}=0.036$, $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)}=0.094$,\n$d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)}=0.123$, $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(3)}=0.386$,\n$d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(2)}=0.071$, $d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(3)}=0.236$,\n$\\pi=0.269$.\n\nUsing these decrements and the additive independence assumptions, compute the utility for health state $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$, i.e., $\\ell_{\\mathrm{MO}}=1$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{SC}}=2$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{UA}}=3$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{PD}}=2$, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{AD}}=1$.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem from the field of translational medicine and health economics, requiring the calculation of a health state utility based on a defined multiattribute model.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nFirst, I will extract the givens and validate the problem statement according to the established protocol.\n\n**Givens:**\nThe problem defines a utility model for the EQ-5D-3L Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) instrument, based on the UK Time Trade-Off (TTO) valuation.\nA health state is a $5$-dimensional vector $\\ell = (\\ell_{\\mathrm{MO}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{SC}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{UA}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{PD}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{AD}})$ where $\\ell_i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\nThe utility scale is anchored at $U=1$ for full health ($1$-$1$-$1$-$1$-$1$) and $U=0$ for dead.\nThe utility $U$ for a given health state is calculated as a decrement from full health, based on the principle of additive independence.\nThe components of the decrement are:\n1.  An intercept decrement, $d_{0}$, applied if the health state is not full health.\n2.  Dimension- and level-specific decrements: $d_{D}^{(L)}$ for dimension $D$ at level $L \\in \\{2, 3\\}$.\n3.  An additional penalty coefficient, $\\pi$, applied if any dimension is at level $3$.\n\nThe specific coefficients for the UK tariff are provided:\n- $d_{0} = 0.081$\n- $d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(2)} = 0.069$, $d_{\\mathrm{MO}}^{(3)} = 0.314$\n- $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)} = 0.104$, $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(3)} = 0.214$\n- $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(2)} = 0.036$, $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)} = 0.094$\n- $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)} = 0.123$, $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(3)} = 0.386$\n- $d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(2)} = 0.071$, $d_{\\mathrm{AD}}^{(3)} = 0.236$\n- $\\pi = 0.269$\n\nThe task is to compute the utility for the health state $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$. This corresponds to the level vector $\\ell = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)$.\n\n**Validation:**\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is located within the established domain of health economics and outcomes research. The EQ-5D is a standard, widely used instrument. The described model is a correct representation of the well-known Dolan et al. (1997) valuation model for the EQ-5D-3L in the UK, derived using TTO. The coefficients are the actual published values. The concepts are factually sound and based on established scientific principles of Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT). The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear, albeit verbally described, algorithm and all necessary numerical data to compute a unique value for the utility of the specified health state. The task is unambiguous.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem uses precise, standard terminology from the field. It is free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The structure is a straightforward application of a defined quantitative model.\n\n**Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe utility $U$ for a health state $\\ell = (\\ell_{\\mathrm{MO}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{SC}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{UA}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{PD}}, \\ell_{\\mathrm{AD}})$ is calculated by subtracting a total decrement, $D(\\ell)$, from the utility of full health, which is $1$.\n$$U(\\ell) = 1 - D(\\ell)$$\nThe total decrement $D(\\ell)$ is the sum of all applicable decrements based on the state's deviation from full health ($1$-$1$-$1$-$1$-$1$). Following the structure described:\n1.  If the state is not $1$-$1$-$1$-$1$-$1$, the intercept decrement $d_{0}$ is applied.\n2.  For each dimension $i$ with a level $\\ell_i > 1$, the corresponding decrement $d_{i}^{(\\ell_i)}$ is added.\n3.  If any dimension is at level $3$, the penalty $\\pi$ is applied.\n\nLet's formalize this. Let $\\mathbf{1}$ be the vector $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ representing full health. Let $I(\\cdot)$ be the indicator function, which is $1$ if its argument is true and $0$ otherwise. The total decrement for a state $\\ell$ is:\n$$D(\\ell) = d_{0} \\cdot I(\\ell \\ne \\mathbf{1}) + \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{MO,SC,UA,PD,AD}\\}} d_{i}^{(\\ell_i)} \\cdot I(\\ell_i > 1) + \\pi \\cdot I(\\exists i: \\ell_i = 3)$$\nNote that the problem defines decrements only for levels $2$ and $3$, which is consistent with the term $I(\\ell_i > 1)$, as the implicit decrement for level $1$ is $0$.\n\nThe specific health state to be evaluated is $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$. Let's denote this state vector as $\\ell^{*} = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)$.\nWe determine the applicable decrements for $\\ell^{*}$:\n-   **Intercept**: The state $\\ell^{*} = (1, 2, 3, 2, 1)$ is not full health $\\mathbf{1}=(1,1,1,1,1)$. Therefore, the intercept decrement $d_{0}$ applies.\n-   **Dimension/Level Decrements**: We sum the decrements for each dimension where the level is greater than $1$:\n    -   Mobility (MO) is at level $1$: decrement is $0$.\n    -   Self-Care (SC) is at level $2$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)}$.\n    -   Usual Activities (UA) is at level $3$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)}$.\n    -   Pain/Discomfort (PD) is at level $2$: decrement is $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)}$.\n    -   Anxiety/Depression (AD) is at level $1$: decrement is $0$.\n-   **Penalty**: The state vector contains a level $3$ (for Usual Activities, $\\ell_{\\mathrm{UA}}=3$). Therefore, the penalty $\\pi$ applies.\n\nThe total decrement $D(\\ell^{*})$ is the sum of these components:\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = d_{0} + d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)} + d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)} + d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)} + \\pi$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the coefficients:\n-   $d_{0} = 0.081$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{SC}}^{(2)} = 0.104$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{UA}}^{(3)} = 0.094$\n-   $d_{\\mathrm{PD}}^{(2)} = 0.123$\n-   $\\pi = 0.269$\n\nSumming these values:\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = 0.081 + 0.104 + 0.094 + 0.123 + 0.269$$\n$$D(\\ell^{*}) = 0.671$$\nThe utility $U(\\ell^{*})$ is then calculated as:\n$$U(\\ell^{*}) = 1 - D(\\ell^{*}) = 1 - 0.671 = 0.329$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.329$ has three significant figures. To express it with four, we append a zero.\n$$U(\\ell^{*}) \\approx 0.3290$$\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation if the result is negative. Since the calculated utility of $0.3290$ is positive, it falls between dead ($U=0$) and full health ($U=1$). This means the health state $1$-$2$-$3$-$2$-$1$ is considered better than being dead. Therefore, the conditional requirement to interpret a negative utility is not activated.",

HRQoL is assessed with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function T-score, a standardized score commonly used in clinical research.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established biostatistics and psychometrics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the baseline score be represented by the random variable $X$ and the post-intervention score by the random variable $Y$. We are given the following sample statistics, which we will use as estimates for the population parameters:\n- Mean baseline score: $\\mu_X = 42.0$\n- Standard deviation of baseline scores: $\\sigma_X = 8.5$\n- Mean post-intervention score: $\\mu_Y = 49.3$\n- Standard deviation of post-intervention scores: $\\sigma_Y = 7.4$\n- Pearson correlation between baseline and post-intervention scores: $\\rho_{XY} = 0.58$\n\nThe change from baseline is defined as the random variable $D = Y - X$. The problem requires the computation of two effect size metrics: the Standardized Response Mean (SRM) and Cohen's $d$ for a pre-post design, followed by an interpretation of their magnitudes.\n\nFirst, we compute the Standardized Response Mean (SRM). The SRM is defined as the mean change score divided by the standard deviation of the change scores.\nThe mean change score, $\\mu_D$, is the expectation of $D$:\n$$\n\\mu_D = E[D] = E[Y - X]\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, this is:\n$$\n\\mu_D = E[Y] - E[X] = \\mu_Y - \\mu_X\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mu_D = 49.3 - 42.0 = 7.3\n$$\nNext, we must find the standard deviation of the change scores, $\\sigma_D$. This is the square root of the variance of $D$, $\\text{Var}(D)$. We derive this from the core definition of the variance of the difference of two correlated random variables:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(D) = \\text{Var}(Y - X) = \\text{Var}(Y) + \\text{Var}(X) - 2\\text{Cov}(X, Y)\n$$\nThe covariance, $\\text{Cov}(X, Y)$, is related to the correlation coefficient $\\rho_{XY}$ and the standard deviations $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ by the definition of correlation:\n$$\n\\rho_{XY} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y} \\implies \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\rho_{XY} \\sigma_X \\sigma_Y\n$$\nSubstituting this into the variance formula gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_D^2 = \\text{Var}(D) = \\sigma_Y^2 + \\sigma_X^2 - 2\\rho_{XY}\\sigma_X\\sigma_Y\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$$\n\\sigma_X^2 = (8.5)^2 = 72.25\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_Y^2 = (7.4)^2 = 54.76\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_D^2 = 54.76 + 72.25 - 2(0.58)(8.5)(7.4) = 127.01 - 72.964 = 54.046\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the change scores is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_D = \\sqrt{54.046} \\approx 7.3516\n$$\nThe SRM is then calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{SRM} = \\frac{\\mu_D}{\\sigma_D} = \\frac{7.3}{7.3516} \\approx 0.99298\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\text{SRM} = 0.993$.\n\nSecond, we compute the effect size Cohen's $d$ for a pre-post design. This is defined as the mean change score standardized by the pooled within-time standard deviation. The pooled standard deviation, $\\sigma_p$, is calculated from the variances of the pre- and post-intervention scores.\n$$\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_X^2 + \\sigma_Y^2}{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the variances we calculated earlier:\n$$\n\\sigma_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{72.25 + 54.76}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{127.01}{2}} = \\sqrt{63.505} \\approx 7.9690\n$$\nCohen's $d$ is then:\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\mu_D}{\\sigma_p} = \\frac{7.3}{7.9690} \\approx 0.91605\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $d = 0.916$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the magnitude of these results. Both the SRM and Cohen's $d$ are standardized mean differences, and their magnitudes can be interpreted using common conventions, such as those proposed by Cohen:\n- Small effect: $|d| \\approx 0.2$\n- Medium effect: $|d| \\approx 0.5$\n- Large effect: $|d| \\approx 0.8$\n\nOur calculated values are $\\text{SRM} \\approx 0.993$ and $d \\approx 0.916$. Both of these values exceed the threshold of $0.8$ for a large effect size. This indicates that the neuromuscular rehabilitation protocol had a substantial positive impact on the patients' physical function as measured by the PROMIS T-score. The average improvement of $7.3$ points is large relative to both the variability of the change itself (as measured by SRM) and the pooled variability at the two time points (as measured by Cohen's $d$). From a clinical perspective, such a large effect size suggests that the intervention is highly effective and produces meaningful improvements in the target population's health-related quality of life. The difference between the SRM and Cohen's $d$ values arises from their different denominators. The SRM is sensitive to the correlation between pre- and post-test scores (a higher correlation reduces $\\sigma_D$ and increases SRM), while Cohen's $d$ is not.",

A QALY is the integral of the utility function, $u(t)$, over the time horizon. The time horizon is $1$ year.\n$$ \\text{QALY} = \\int_{0}^{1} u(t) \\, dt $$\nThe time points of measurement are $t_0 = 0$ months, $t_1 = 6$ months, and $t_2 = 12$ months. In units of years, these are $T_0 = 0$, $T_1 = 0.5$, and $T_2 = 1$. The assumption that utility varies linearly between these points means the integral can be calculated as the sum of the areas of two trapezoids: one over the interval $[T_0, T_1]$ and another over $[T_1, T_2]$.\n\nThe area of a trapezoid is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base}_1 + \\text{base}_2) \\times \\text{height}$.

Compute the ICER:**\n\n$$ \\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta C}{\\Delta Q} = \\frac{5,600}{0.07} = \\frac{5,600 \\times 100}{7} = 800 \\times 100 = 80,000 $$\nThe ICER is \\$80,000 per QALY.\n\n**4. Interpret Cost-Effectiveness:**\nAn intervention is considered cost-effective if its ICER is less than or equal to the decision-maker's willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold.\n\n- **At a WTP threshold of \\$50,000 per QALY:**\nSince $\\text{ICER} = 80,000 > \\text{WTP} = 50,000$, the New Intervention would **not** be considered cost-effective at this threshold. The cost to gain one QALY is higher than what the system is willing to pay.\n\n- **At a WTP threshold of \\$100,000 per QALY:**\nSince $\\text{ICER} = 80,000 \\le \\text{WTP} = 100,000$, the New Intervention **would** be considered cost-effective at this threshold. The cost to gain one QALY is within the acceptable range.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the ICER rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $80,000$. To represent this quantity unambiguously with three significant figures, scientific notation is appropriate.\n$$ 80,000 = 8.00 \\times 10^4 $$",
