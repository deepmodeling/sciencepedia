The context, Protein A chromatography for monoclonal antibody purification, is a standard and well-understood unit operation in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and translational medicine.

The scenario is a standard representation of process characterization in the biopharmaceutical industry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be used is the law of conservation of mass. The problem requires the calculation of the step yield, $\\eta$, for a chromatography process. The yield is defined as the fraction of the total mass of product loaded onto the column that is recovered in the desired output stream, which is the elution pool.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total mass of the monoclonal antibody loaded onto the column, denoted as $M_{\\text{load}}$. Based on the given assumption that densities are equivalent to that of water, the mass $M$ in any stream can be calculated as the product of its volume $V$ and concentration $C$:\n$$M = V \\times C$$\n\nFor the load stream, the mass is:\n$$M_{\\text{load}} = V_{\\text{load}} \\times C_{\\text{load}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$M_{\\text{load}} = (120.0~\\text{L}) \\times (2.500~\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) = 300.0~\\text{g}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the mass of the monoclonal antibody recovered in the elution pool, which is the purified product intended for the drug substance. This mass is denoted as $M_{\\text{E}}$.\n$$M_{\\text{E}} = V_{\\text{E}} \\times C_{\\text{E}}$$\nSubstituting the given values for the elution pool:\n$$M_{\\text{E}} = (14.000~\\text{L}) \\times (20.000~\\text{g}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}) = 280.0~\\text{g}$$\n\nThe problem defines the step yield, $\\eta$, as the fraction of the loaded product mass ($M_{\\text{load}}$) that is recovered in the elution pool ($M_{\\text{E}}$).\n$$\\eta = \\frac{\\text{Mass of product in elution pool}}{\\text{Total mass of product loaded}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{E}}}{M_{\\text{load}}}$$\n\nThe other streams (flowthrough, washes, strip, and hold-up) contain product that was not recovered in the desired fraction and are correctly identified as losses for the purpose of this yield calculation.\n\nSubstituting the calculated mass values into the yield equation:\n$$\\eta = \\frac{280.0~\\text{g}}{300.0~\\text{g}}$$\n\nThe units of grams ($\\text{g}$) cancel, resulting in a dimensionless fraction, as expected for a yield.\n$$\\eta = \\frac{280.0}{300.0} = \\frac{28}{30} = \\frac{14}{15}$$\n\nTo express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n$$\\eta = 0.93333...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $3$, $3$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we truncate).\n$$\\eta \\approx 0.9333$$\nThis is the step yield of the Protein A capture chromatography process.",

All necessary data, definitions, and assumptions are provided. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two independent parts.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of the afucosylated fraction.\n\nThe afucosylated fraction, which we denote as $F_{afuc}$, is defined as the ratio of the sum of the peak areas of afucosylated glycoforms to the sum of the areas of all listed glycoforms.\n\nThe given peak areas for the afucosylated glycoforms are:\n- $G0 = 18234$\n- $G1 = 24578$\n- $G2 = 10345$\n- $\\mathrm{Man}5 = 5342$\n\nThe sum of the areas for the afucosylated species, $S_{afuc}$, is:\n$$S_{afuc} = 18234 + 24578 + 10345 + 5342 = 58499$$\n\nThe given peak areas for the fucosylated glycoforms are:\n- $G0F = 56890$\n- $G1F = 47321$\n- $G2F = 15234$\n\nThe sum of the areas for the fucosylated species, $S_{fuc}$, is:\n$$S_{fuc} = 56890 + 47321 + 15234 = 119445$$\n\nThe total area, $S_{total}$, is the sum of all listed peak areas, which is the sum of the afucosylated and fucosylated areas:\n$$S_{total} = S_{afuc} + S_{fuc} = 58499 + 119445 = 177944$$\n\nThe afucosylated fraction is then calculated as:\n$$F_{afuc} = \\frac{S_{afuc}}{S_{total}} = \\frac{58499}{177944}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$F_{afuc} \\approx 0.32875135$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.

The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit.\n$$F_{afuc} \\approx 0.3288$$\n\nPart 2: Determination of the minimal sample size $n$.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum integer sample size $n$ per lot required to ensure that the half-width of a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) for the difference in lot means is no greater than the margin of equivalence, $A$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Margin of equivalence: $A = 0.02$\n- Process standard deviation: $\\sigma = 0.012$\n- Confidence level: $95\\%$, which corresponds to a significance level of $\\alpha = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nWe are comparing the means of two lots, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, with sample sizes $n_1 = n_2 = n$.

For non-intrathecal intravenous (IV) administration, this threshold is specified as $K$.\n\nLet's define the variables provided in the problem statement:\n- The pyrogenic threshold, $K = 5$ Endotoxin Units per kilogram (EU/kg).\n- The maximum labeled dose of the drug product, $D_{max} = 10$ milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).\n- The body weight of the representative patient, $W = 73.5$ kilograms (kg).\n\nThe problem requires a two-part derivation. First, we must derive the product-specific endotoxin limit, which we will denote as $L_{product}$. This limit is expressed in units of EU per milligram of drug product (EU/mg). The total endotoxin exposure per kilogram of body weight is the product of the endotoxin content in the drug ($L_{product}$) and the dose of the drug administered per kilogram of body weight ($D_{max}$). To comply with the regulations, this value must not exceed the threshold $K$. The limiting condition is thus expressed by the equation:\n$$L_{product} \\times D_{max} \\le K$$\nTo establish the maximum allowable endotoxin concentration in the product, we solve for $L_{product}$ at the equality, which defines the specification limit:\n$$L_{product, max} = \\frac{K}{D_{max}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$L_{product, max} = \\frac{5 \\text{ EU/kg}}{10 \\text{ mg/kg}} = 0.5 \\text{ EU/mg}$$\nThis is the product-specific endotoxin limit.\n\nSecond, we must infer the maximum allowable total endotoxin load per dose for the specified patient. We will denote this as $L_{total, max}$. This value represents the total number of Endotoxin Units that can be administered to the patient in a single dose without inducing a pyrogenic response, according to the regulatory standard.\n\nThis can be calculated directly from the pyrogenic threshold $K$ and the patient's body weight $W$. The maximum allowable total load is the threshold per unit mass multiplied by the total mass of the patient.\n$$L_{total, max} = K \\times W$$\nSubstituting the given values for $K$ and $W$:\n$$L_{total, max} = (5 \\text{ EU/kg}) \\times (73.5 \\text{ kg})$$\n$$L_{total, max} = 367.5 \\text{ EU}$$\n\nAs a verification of this result, we can alternatively calculate the total load using the product-specific limit $L_{product, max}$ and the total mass of the drug administered to the patient.\nFirst, calculate the total mass of the drug, $M_{drug}$, administered at the maximum labeled dose:\n$$M_{drug} = D_{max} \\times W = (10 \\text{ mg/kg}) \\times (73.5 \\text{ kg}) = 735 \\text{ mg}$$\nNext, calculate the total endotoxin load by multiplying the total mass of the drug by the product-specific endotoxin limit:\n$$L_{total, max} = M_{drug} \\times L_{product, max} = (735 \\text{ mg}) \\times (0.5 \\text{ EU/mg})$$\n$$L_{total, max} = 367.5 \\text{ EU}$$\nThe results from both methods are identical, confirming the internal consistency of the calculation.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $367.5$, which already contains four significant figures. Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.",
