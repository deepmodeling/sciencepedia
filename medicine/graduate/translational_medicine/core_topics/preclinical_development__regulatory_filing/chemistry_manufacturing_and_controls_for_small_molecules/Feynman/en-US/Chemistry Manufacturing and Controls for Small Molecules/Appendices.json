A solution will be developed.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to determine the pilot-scale agitation speed, $N_2$, that ensures dynamic similarity with the lab scale. Dynamic similarity is defined in the problem as maintaining an equal Reynolds number ($Re$). For an agitated tank with impeller diameter $D$ and agitation speed $N$, the impeller Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$Re = \\frac{\\rho N D^2}{\\mu}$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. For the Reynolds number to be dimensionless, the agitation speed $N$ must be in units of revolutions per unit time, such as $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe condition for scale-up is $Re_1 = Re_2$.\n$$\\frac{\\rho_1 N_1 D_1^2}{\\mu_1} = \\frac{\\rho_2 N_2 D_2^2}{\\mu_2}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the unknown pilot-scale agitation speed, $N_2$.\n$$N_2 = N_1 \\left( \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\mu_2}{\\mu_1} \\right) \\left( \\frac{D_1}{D_2} \\right)^2$$\nSince $N_1$ and $N_2$ appear as a ratio, we can perform the calculation using $N_1$ in revolutions per minute ($\\mathrm{rpm}$), and the resulting $N_2$ will also be in $\\mathrm{rpm}$. Substituting the given values:\n$$N_2 = (450\\,\\mathrm{rpm}) \\left( \\frac{950\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{920\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.080\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.400\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2$$\n$$N_2 = 450 \\left( \\frac{95}{92} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1.0}{1.2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{5} \\right)^2$$\n$$N_2 = 450 \\left( \\frac{95}{92} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{1.2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{25} \\right) = \\frac{450 \\times 95}{92 \\times 1.2 \\times 25} = \\frac{42750}{2760}$$\n$$N_2 \\approx 15.48913\\,\\mathrm{rpm}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the required pilot-scale agitation speed is $N_2 = 15.5\\,\\mathrm{rpm}$.\n\nNext, we must estimate the pilot-scale power input per unit mass, $\\varepsilon_2$, and assess the shear risk. The power input, $P$, to an agitated vessel is related to the fluid properties and operating conditions through the dimensionless Power number, $N_p$:\n$$N_p = \\frac{P}{\\rho N^3 D^5}$$\nFor baffled tanks operating in the turbulent flow regime (typically $Re > 10^4$), the Power number is approximately constant for a given geometry. We must first verify that the lab-scale operation is turbulent.\nThe lab-scale agitation speed in s$^{-1}$ is $N_1 = 450\\,\\mathrm{rpm} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{min}}{60\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$$Re_1 = \\frac{(950\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})(7.5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(0.080\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{45.6}{1.2 \\times 10^{-3}} = 38000 = 3.8 \\times 10^4$$\nSince $Re_1 > 10^4$, the flow is turbulent. As $Re_2 = Re_1$, the flow at the pilot scale is also turbulent. Therefore, we can assume $N_{p,1} = N_{p,2}$.\n$$\\frac{P_1}{\\rho_1 N_1^3 D_1^5} = \\frac{P_2}{\\rho_2 N_2^3 D_2^5}$$\nThe problem provides power input per unit mass, $\\varepsilon = P/m$, where $m = \\rho V$ is the mass of the fluid and $V$ is the volume. Thus, $P = \\varepsilon m = \\varepsilon \\rho V$. Substituting this into the Power number equality:\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 \\rho_1 V_1}{\\rho_1 N_1^3 D_1^5} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_2 \\rho_2 V_2}{\\rho_2 N_2^3 D_2^5}$$\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 V_1}{N_1^3 D_1^5} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_2 V_2}{N_2^3 D_2^5}$$\nFor geometrically similar vessels, the volume scales with the cube of a characteristic linear dimension, such as the impeller diameter: $V \\propto D^3$. Therefore, $V_1 = k D_1^3$ and $V_2 = k D_2^3$ for some constant of proportionality $k$.\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon_1 (k D_1^3)}{N_1^3 D_1^5} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_2 (k D_2^3)}{N_2^3 D_2^5}$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the scaling relationship for power per unit mass:\n$$\\frac{\\varepsilon_1}{N_1^3 D_1^2} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_2}{N_2^3 D_2^2}$$\nSolving for $\\varepsilon_2$:\n$$\\varepsilon_2 = \\varepsilon_1 \\left( \\frac{N_2}{N_1} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{D_2}{D_1} \\right)^2$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\\varepsilon_2 = (1.8\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}) \\left( \\frac{15.48913\\,\\mathrm{rpm}}{450\\,\\mathrm{rpm}} \\right)^3 \\left( \\frac{0.400\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.080\\,\\mathrm{m}} \\right)^2$$\n$$\\varepsilon_2 = 1.8 \\times (0.03442...)^3 \\times (5)^2$$\n$$\\varepsilon_2 = 1.8 \\times (4.077... \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 25 \\approx 0.001835\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$$\nThe estimated power input per unit mass at the pilot scale is $\\varepsilon_2 \\approx 1.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we assess the degradation risk. The threshold for non-negligible risk is given as $0.50\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$. Comparing our calculated value for the pilot scale:\n$$\\varepsilon_2 \\approx 0.0018\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\ll 0.50\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$$\nThe power input per unit mass at the pilot scale is more than two orders of magnitude below the specified shear sensitivity threshold. Therefore, under the scale-up condition of constant Reynolds number, the API is not at a heightened degradation risk. In fact, the shear environment, as indicated by power per unit mass, is substantially gentler than in the lab-scale vessel.",

Denote the integrated areas for the two enantiomers as $A_{R}$ and $A_{S}$, and their injected molar amounts as $n_{R}$ and $n_{S}$.

The maximum mass that can dissolve in this volume is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{diss, g, max}} = S(1.5) \\times V_g = 20.0100237\\,\\mathrm{mg/L} \\times 0.250\\,\\mathrm{L} = 5.0025059\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe administered dose is $M_{\\mathrm{dose}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. Since $M_{\\mathrm{dose}} > M_{\\mathrm{diss, g, max}}$, the stomach solution is saturated, and the mass of dissolved drug is precisely $M_{\\mathrm{dissolved}} = 5.0025059\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nAccording to the problem, this dissolved mass, contained in volume $V_g$, is emptied into the intestine and mixes with an additional volume $V_i = 500\\,\\mathrm{mL} = 0.500\\,\\mathrm{L}$. The total volume immediately after mixing is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_g + V_i = 0.250\\,\\mathrm{L} + 0.500\\,\\mathrm{L} = 0.750\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\nThe initial dissolved concentration in the intestine, $C_{\\mathrm{initial, i}}$, is the transferred dissolved mass divided by this new total volume:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{initial, i}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{dissolved}}}{V_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{5.0025059\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{0.750\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 6.6700079\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$$\n\n## Task 4: Computation of the Intestinal Supersaturation Ratio\n\nThe intestinal supersaturation ratio, $SR_i$, is defined as the ratio of the initial dissolved concentration in the intestine to the apparent solubility at intestinal $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n$$SR_i = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{initial, i}}}{S(7.4)}$$\nUsing the values calculated in the previous tasks:\n$$SR_i = \\frac{6.6700079\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{7982.1434\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} = 0.00083561...$$\nA supersaturation ratio less than $1$ indicates an undersaturated solution, meaning there is no thermodynamic driving force for precipitation. For this specific weak acid under these conditions, the risk of precipitation upon transfer from the stomach to the intestine is effectively zero.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$SR_i \\approx 0.0008356$$\nThis can also be expressed in scientific notation as $8.356 \\times 10^{-4}$.",
