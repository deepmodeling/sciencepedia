The described expression cassette components (promoter, intron, coding sequence, WPRE, polyA) are standard elements in molecular biology and are commonly used in such constructs. The lengths provided for these elements are realistic. The principle of summing the lengths of non-overlapping, contiguous segments is a fundamental and correct concept for determining the total length of a linear DNA molecule. The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of molecular genetics and virology. It is directly related to the specified topic of *gene therapy principles and vector systems*.\n\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary numerical data (the lengths of the five components) and a clear, unambiguous rule for their combination (summation). The objective is to calculate a single, uniquely determined quantity (total length).\n\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or opinion-based statements. The problem poses a clear-cut calculation based on given facts.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed for invalidation. It is scientifically sound, fully specified, internally consistent, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be generated.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total length of a gene expression cassette, which is constructed by concatenating several non-overlapping DNA segments. The governing principle, as stated in the problem, is that the total length is the arithmetic sum of the lengths of the individual segments.\n\nLet $L_{total}$ represent the total size of the expression cassette in kilobases (kb). Let the lengths of the constituent modules be denoted as follows:\n- $L_{promoter}$: Length of the promoter\n- $L_{intron}$: Length of the intron\n- $L_{coding}$: Length of the protein-coding sequence\n- $L_{WPRE}$: Length of the WPRE\n- $L_{polyA}$: Length of the polyadenylation signal\n\nAccording to the provided principle for non-overlapping, concatenated segments, the total length is given by the sum:\n$$\nL_{total} = L_{promoter} + L_{intron} + L_{coding} + L_{WPRE} + L_{polyA}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $L_{promoter} = 0.8 \\text{ kb}$\n- $L_{intron} = 0.4 \\text{ kb}$\n- $L_{coding} = 1.8 \\text{ kb}$\n- $L_{WPRE} = 0.6 \\text{ kb}$\n- $L_{polyA} = 0.2 \\text{ kb}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$\nL_{total} = 0.8 + 0.4 + 1.8 + 0.6 + 0.2\n$$\n\nThe sum is calculated as follows:\n$$\nL_{total} = (0.8 + 0.4) + 1.8 + (0.6 + 0.2)\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 1.2 + 1.8 + 0.8\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 3.0 + 0.8\n$$\n$$\nL_{total} = 3.8\n$$\n\nThe total size of the expression cassette is $3.8$ kb. This value is exact, as required. This calculation is a critical step in AAV vector design, as the total length of the DNA packaged between the ITRs must not exceed the virus's packaging capacity, which is approximately $4.7$ kb. A cassette size of $3.8$ kb is well within this limit.",

It provides sufficient data and clear definitions to calculate a unique, meaningful answer.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective language without subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Consistency and Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary parameters for the calculation of the final yield of full capsids. The information regarding the removal of empty capsids ($30\\%$) is explicitly decoupled from the recovery of full capsids, preventing any contradiction. This information is extraneous to the calculation of the final full capsid quantity but does not invalidate the problem; rather, it tests the ability to discern relevant from irrelevant data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a straightforward mass balance calculation common in bioprocess engineering. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to determine the final number of genome copies after purification. This quantity is designated as the final full capsid yield.\n\nFirst, I must calculate the total number of genome copies ($G_{\\text{total}}$) present in the initial crude lysate. The problem provides the formula relating titer ($\\tau$), total genome copies ($G_{\\text{total}}$), and volume ($V$):\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = \\tau_{crude} \\times V$$\n\nThe given units for titer ($\\mathrm{gc}\\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$) and volume ($\\mathrm{L}$) are inconsistent. A unit conversion is required. I will convert the volume from Liters to milliliters.\n$$1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\nTherefore, the volume $V$ in milliliters is:\n$$V = 200\\ \\mathrm{L} \\times \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{mL}}{1\\ \\mathrm{L}} = 200000\\ \\mathrm{mL} = 2.0 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nNow, I can calculate $G_{\\text{total}}$ by substituting the given values:\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{13}\\ \\mathrm{gc}\\ \\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{mL})$$\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = (1.0 \\times 2.0) \\times 10^{(13+5)}\\ \\mathrm{gc}$$\n$$G_{\\text{total}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{gc}$$\nThis is the total number of genome copies, and by the problem's assumption, the total number of full capsids in the bioreactor before purification.\n\nNext, the problem states an overall recovery of packaged genomes, $r$, is $50\\%$. This is the fraction of full capsids that are successfully recovered through the entire downstream purification train. The final number of recovered full capsids, $G_{\\text{recovered}}$, is given by:\n$$G_{\\text{recovered}} = r \\times G_{\\text{total}}$$\nThe recovery fraction $r$ must be expressed as a decimal:\n$$r = 50\\% = 0.5$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $r$ and $G_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$G_{\\text{recovered}} = 0.5 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{gc})$$\n$$G_{\\text{recovered}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{gc}$$\n\nThe information that an orthogonal polishing step removes $30\\%$ of empty capsids is explicitly stated to *not* affect the number of full capsids. This step improves the purity of the final product (the ratio of full to empty capsids) but does not alter the total quantity of recovered full capsids. Therefore, this information is not needed for the calculation of the final yield in genome copies.\n\nThe final full capsid yield is equal to $G_{\\text{recovered}}$.",

This corresponds to a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$. The probability mass function (PMF) for $K=k$ integrations is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\binom{N}{k} p^k (1-p)^{N-k}$$\nwhere $\\binom{N}{k} = \\frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the limiting distribution as $N \\to \\infty$ and $p \\to 0$ such that the product $Np = \\lambda$ remains constant.

The term in the square brackets is a product of $k$ terms:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left[ \\left(1\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{1}{N}\\right) \\left(1-\\frac{2}{N}\\right) \\cdots \\left(1-\\frac{k-1}{N}\\right) \\right] = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdots 1 = 1$$\n2.

The term $\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^{-k}$ approaches $1$ as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{N}\\right)^{-k} = (1-0)^{-k} = 1$$\nCombining these results, we find the limiting PMF:\n$$\\lim_{N\\to\\infty} P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k}{k!} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThis is the PMF of the Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda$.\n\n### General Analytic Expression for $P(K=k)$\nThe derivation above provides the general analytic expression for the PMF of the number of integrations $K$, which follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThis function gives the probability of observing exactly $k$ integrations in a cell for a given average number of integrations $\\lambda$.\n\n### Specific Analytic Expressions and Calculations\nWe are asked to evaluate expressions and probabilities for $\\lambda = 0.5$ and $\\lambda = 2.0$.\n\nFor $\\lambda = 0.5$:\nThe explicit analytic expression for the PMF is:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{(0.5)^k \\exp(-0.5)}{k!}$$\n\nFor $\\lambda = 2.0$:\nThe explicit analytic expression for the PMF is:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{2^k \\exp(-2)}{k!}$$\nNote that in the analytic expression, the integer $2$ is used for mathematical clarity instead of the floating-point representation $2.0$.\n\nNext, we compute the fraction of cells with at least two integrations, $P(K \\geq 2)$, for each value of $\\lambda$.
