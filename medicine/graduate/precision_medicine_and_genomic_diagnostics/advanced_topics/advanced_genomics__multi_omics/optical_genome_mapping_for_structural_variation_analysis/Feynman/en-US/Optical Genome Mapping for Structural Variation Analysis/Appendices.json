            "problem": "In Optical Genome Mapping (OGM), fluorescent labels are placed at specific sequence motifs along long DNA molecules. For sufficiently long molecules, the locations of labels along a genomic segment can be modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process with constant rate (label density) per unit length. An inversion that is present in the sample will reverse the order of labels within the inverted interval relative to the flanking reference, and labels within this interval are considered informative for detecting an orientation-reversed alignment. Assume the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- In a homogeneous Poisson point process of rate $\\lambda$ labels per unit length, the number of labels $N$ observed in a segment of length $L$ has expected value $\\mathbb{E}[N] = \\lambda L$.\n- A consensus OGM map integrates many molecules; for design purposes, the minimum segment length needed to achieve at least $k$ informative labels in the inverted interval can be set by requiring the expected number of labels within the inversion to be at least $k$.\n\nSuppose the label density is $\\lambda = 15$ labels per $100$ kilobases and that every label within the inversion contributes information about the orientation reversal. Derive from first principles the minimum inversion length $L_{\\min}$ that yields an orientation-reversed label pattern with at least $k$ informative labels. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $k$, and express the length in kilobases (kb).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum inversion length, denoted as $L_{\\min}$, necessary to observe at least $k$ informative labels within that inversion, based on a specific design criterion. The derivation will proceed from the first principles outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem by defining the relevant variables and parameters.\nLet $L$ be the length of the genomic segment corresponding to the inversion. The problem specifies that the final answer for this length should be in units of kilobases (kb).\nLet $k$ be the minimum required number of informative labels within the inversion. $k$ is a positive integer.\nThe locations of fluorescent labels are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process with a constant rate, or label density, denoted by $\\lambda$.\nThe given label density is $\\lambda_{\\text{given}} = 15$ labels per $100$ kilobases. To maintain dimensional consistency with the length $L$ in kb, we must express $\\lambda$ in units of labels per kilobase.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{15 \\text{ labels}}{100 \\text{ kb}} = 0.15 \\text{ kb}^{-1} $$\nThis can also be expressed as a rational number:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{15}{100} \\text{ kb}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{20} \\text{ kb}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem states that for a homogeneous Poisson point process, the number of events (labels), $N$, occurring in a segment of length $L$ has an expected value given by the formula:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N] = \\lambda L $$\n\nThe problem defines a specific design criterion for determining the minimum required length. It states that \"the minimum segment length needed to achieve at least $k$ informative labels ... can be set by requiring the expected number of labels within the inversion to be at least $k$.\"\nMathematically, this criterion is expressed as an inequality:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[N] \\ge k $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for the expected value, $\\mathbb{E}[N]$, into this inequality, we get:\n$$ \\lambda L \\ge k $$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the minimum inversion length, $L_{\\min}$, that satisfies this condition. The inequality $\\lambda L \\ge k$ defines a set of all possible lengths $L$ that meet the criterion. Since $\\lambda$ and $L$ are both non-negative quantities, we can solve for $L$:\n$$ L \\ge \\frac{k}{\\lambda} $$\nThe minimum length, $L_{\\min}$, is the smallest value of $L$ that satisfies this condition. This occurs at the boundary of the inequality, where equality holds:\n$$ L_{\\min} = \\frac{k}{\\lambda} $$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for the label density $\\lambda$ that we previously calculated.\n$$ L_{\\min} = \\frac{k}{\\frac{3}{20}} $$\nBy simplifying this expression, we obtain the final analytical form for $L_{\\min}$ in terms of $k$:\n$$ L_{\\min} = k \\cdot \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{20k}{3} $$\n\nThe units of $L_{\\min}$ are kilobases (kb), as required, because the rate $\\lambda$ was expressed in units of $\\text{kb}^{-1}$ and $k$ is a dimensionless count. This expression represents the minimum inversion length, derived from the stated first principles and the expectation-based design criterion, that ensures the expected number of informative labels is equal to $k$.",

This problem  moves from quantitative calculation to conceptual reasoning, challenging you to differentiate between a tandem duplication and a novel insertion.

            "problem": "A long DNA molecule is imaged by Optical Genome Mapping (OGM) and aligned to a human reference genome. OGM labels DNA at specific sequence motifs, creating an ordered barcode of label positions along molecules. The alignment algorithm uses the order and approximate spacing of labels to anchor molecules to the reference. Structural variants alter label order, adjacency, and orientation relative to the reference. A tandem duplication is defined as a gain of a contiguous reference segment inserted adjacent to its original location in the same orientation, preserving the label order and inter-label spacing pattern (up to local stretch scaling). A novel insertion is defined as an addition of sequence not present in the reference anywhere, introducing a block whose labels lack a matching order-and-spacing pattern in the reference and which breaks the direct adjacency of the flanking reference segments.\n\nConsider a reference interval of length $40$ kilobases in which labels occur at positions $p = \\{2, 7, 13, 21, 33\\}$ kilobases in increasing order along the forward strand. Two molecules, $M_1$ and $M_2$, align across this interval with the following qualitative observations:\n\n- Molecule $M_1$: Between the anchors at $p = 2$ and $p = 33$, the label pattern corresponding to the subinterval $[7, 21]$ appears twice in immediate succession, with the same label order and orientation as the reference and with inter-label distances in each copy within a uniform scaling factor $\\alpha$ satisfying $0.95 \\le \\alpha \\le 1.05$. The two copies are adjacent with no intervening unmatched labels, and the molecule preserves direct adjacency from the anchor at $p = 2$ into the first copy, into the second copy, and then to the anchor at $p = 33$.\n\n- Molecule $M_2$: Between the anchors aligned at $p = 21$ and $p = 33$, there exists a block of labels whose order and inter-label distances do not match any region of the reference within the alignment tolerance. This block is flanked by the correct anchors, but the adjacency between $p = 21$ and $p = 33$ seen in the reference is interrupted by the unmatched block. The orientations of the flanking alignments at $p = 21$ and $p = 33$ are forward, and the inserted block contains labels that cannot be placed in forward or reverse orientation to match any reference segment.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions and the first-principles behavior of OGM alignment (order, spacing, orientation, and adjacency of labels relative to the reference), which decision rule correctly differentiates a tandem duplication from a novel insertion in this context?\n\nA. Call tandem duplication when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors, with inter-label spacing preserved up to uniform stretch scaling; call novel insertion when a block of labels between two reference-anchored segments does not match the reference label order-and-spacing pattern anywhere and disrupts the direct adjacency of those anchors.\n\nB. Call novel insertion when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors; call tandem duplication when a block of labels between anchors does not match the reference anywhere and disrupts adjacency.\n\nC.

Call tandem duplication only if the duplicated segment’s inter-label distances match the reference exactly with zero stretch variation; otherwise, any deviation (including small uniform scaling) implies a novel insertion.",
            "solution": "### Derivation of the Decision Rule\n\nThe solution requires formalizing the provided definitions and observations into a general decision rule.\n\n1.  **Analyze Tandem Duplication**: The definition specifies four key features:\n    *   **Repetition**: A segment of the reference is present in an extra copy.\n    *   **Adjacency**: The extra copy is inserted immediately next to the original segment.\n    *   **Orientation**: The extra copy has the same forward/reverse orientation as the original.\n    *   **Pattern Preservation**: The order and spacing of labels are preserved, allowing for minor uniform scaling (e.g., due to experimental factors like DNA stretching).\n    Molecule $M_1$ exhibits all these features. The reference pattern on the interval $[7, 21]$, which includes labels at $\\{7, 13, 21\\}$, is repeated. The two copies are adjacent, in the same orientation, and the inter-label distances are preserved within the specified scaling tolerance ($0.95 \\le \\alpha \\le 1.05$). Therefore, $M_1$ represents a tandem duplication.\n\n2.  **Analyze Novel Insertion**: The definition specifies three key features:\n    *   **Novelty**: An inserted block of sequence/labels is not present anywhere in the reference genome.\n    *   **Pattern Mismatch**: The order and spacing of labels in the inserted block do not match any reference pattern.\n    *   **Adjacency Break**: The insertion disrupts the contiguity of the reference genome, appearing between two segments that are adjacent in the reference.\n    Molecule $M_2$ exhibits these features. Between the reference-anchored positions $p=21$ and $p=33$, there is a block of labels that cannot be matched to the reference. This block breaks the adjacency that should exist between the region ending at $21$ kb and the region starting after $21$ kb. Therefore, $M_2$ represents a novel insertion.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the General Rule**: A correct decision rule must accurately capture both definitions.\n    *   To identify a tandem duplication, one must look for a contiguous, adjacent repetition of a reference-matching label pattern, in the same orientation, with spacing preserved up to a scaling tolerance.\n    *   To identify a novel insertion, one must look for a block of labels, situated between two reference-anchored segments, whose pattern does not match the reference anywhere, thereby breaking the adjacency of the flanking reference segments.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Call tandem duplication when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors, with inter-label spacing preserved up to uniform stretch scaling; call novel insertion when a block of labels between two reference-anchored segments does not match the reference label order-and-spacing pattern anywhere and disrupts the direct adjacency of those anchors.**\nThis option accurately and completely summarizes the definitions provided in the problem statement and the logic derived above. The description for tandem duplication matches the case of $M_1$, and the description for novel insertion matches the case of $M_2$.\n*Verdict: **Correct***\n\n**B. Call novel insertion when a contiguous, adjacent repeat of a reference-matching label pattern appears in the same orientation between the same flanking anchors; call tandem duplication when a block of labels between anchors does not match the reference anywhere and disrupts adjacency.**\nThis option incorrectly swaps the definitions. It assigns the term \"novel insertion\" to the event described for molecule $M_1$ (a tandem duplication) and the term \"tandem duplication\" to the event described for molecule $M_2$ (a novel insertion). This is a direct contradiction of the provided definitions.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\n**C. Call novel insertion whenever any duplicated pattern is observed in reverse orientation between anchors; call tandem duplication only if the duplicated pattern is reverse-oriented and separated by unmatched labels.**\nThis option introduces incorrect conditions. A tandem duplication, by the provided definition, occurs in the *same* orientation, not reverse. A duplicated pattern in reverse orientation would be classified as an inverted duplication, which is a different type of SV. Furthermore, it defines novel insertion in terms of a duplicated pattern, which contradicts the core concept of a novel insertion containing a pattern not found in the reference.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\n**D. Call tandem duplication only if the duplicated segment’s inter-label distances match the reference exactly with zero stretch variation; otherwise, any deviation (including small uniform scaling) implies a novel insertion.**\nThis option introduces an overly strict and unrealistic constraint. The problem explicitly states that tandem duplications preserve the pattern \"up to local stretch scaling\" and gives an example tolerance of $0.95 \\le \\alpha \\le 1.05$. Requiring an exact match with $\\alpha = 1.0$ ignores the physical realities of the OGM experiment and contradicts the premise of the problem. This rule would incorrectly classify many true tandem duplications.\n*Verdict: **Incorrect***\n\nBased on the rigorous application of the provided definitions and analysis of the sample cases, Option A is the only choice that correctly formulates the decision rule.",
