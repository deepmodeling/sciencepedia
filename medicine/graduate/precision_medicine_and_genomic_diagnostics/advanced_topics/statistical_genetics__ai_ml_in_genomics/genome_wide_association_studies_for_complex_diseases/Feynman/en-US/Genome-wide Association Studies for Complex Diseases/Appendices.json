This exercise guides you through a fundamental derivation that connects the per-allele effect size to the proportion of phenotypic variance it explains ($R^2$).

            "problem": "Consider a single-variant additive model in a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of a standardized quantitative trait. Let the trait for individual $i$ be $Y_i$, standardized so that $\\operatorname{E}[Y_i]=0$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(Y_i)=1$. Let the genotype be coded additively as $G_i\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ counting minor alleles at a single biallelic locus with minor allele frequency $p$ in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium.

Then, based on your derivation, explain how $R^2$ translates to phenotypic impact in a population when the trait is standardized. Provide your final result as a single analytic expression in terms of $p$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the proportion of variance in a standardized quantitative trait $Y$ explained by a single genetic variant $G$, denoted by the coefficient of determination $R^2$. The expression is to be in terms of the minor allele frequency, $p$, and the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator of the effect size, $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions. The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, in a simple linear regression model is the fraction of total variance in the dependent variable $Y$ that is explained by the independent variable $G$. It is formally defined as:\n$$R^2 = \\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{Y})}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}$$\nwhere $\\hat{Y}$ represents the predicted values of $Y$ from the regression model. In this problem, the linear model is given by $Y_i = \\mu + \\beta G_i + \\varepsilon_i$. The corresponding fitted OLS model is $\\hat{Y}_i = \\hat{\\mu} + \\hat{\\beta} G_i$, where $\\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$ are the OLS estimators for the intercept and slope, respectively.\n\nThe variance of the predicted values, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{Y})$, can be expressed in terms of the variance of the predictor variable $G$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{Y}) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\mu} + \\hat{\\beta} G) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta} G) = \\hat{\\beta}^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)$$\nHere, we treat the OLS estimator $\\hat{\\beta}$ as a fixed quantity derived from a given sample, and calculate the variance over the distribution of $G$.\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of $R^2$, we get:\n$$R^2 = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)}{\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}$$\nThe problem states that the trait $Y_i$ is standardized, which means its variance is unity: $\\operatorname{Var}(Y_i) = 1$. Therefore, the expression for $R^2$ simplifies to:\n$$R^2 = \\hat{\\beta}^2 \\operatorname{Var}(G)$$\nTo proceed, we must derive the variance of the genotype variable, $\\operatorname{Var}(G)$. The problem specifies that the genotype $G_i$ is coded additively as $0$, $1$, or $2$, counting the number of minor alleles at a single biallelic locus. The population is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) with a minor allele frequency of $p$.\n\nUnder HWE, the probabilities of the three possible genotypes are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $P(G=0) = (1-p)^2$ (homozygous for the major allele)\n    \\item $P(G=1) = 2p(1-p)$ (heterozygous)\n    \\item $P(G=2) = p^2$ (homozygous for the minor allele)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe can now calculate the expected value of $G$, $\\operatorname{E}[G]$:\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G] = \\sum_{g \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}} g \\cdot P(G=g)$$\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G] = (0) \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1) \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2) \\cdot p^2$$\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G] = 2p - 2p^2 + 2p^2 = 2p$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected value of $G^2$, $\\operatorname{E}[G^2]$:\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G^2] = \\sum_{g \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}} g^2 \\cdot P(G=g)$$\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G^2] = (0)^2 \\cdot (1-p)^2 + (1)^2 \\cdot 2p(1-p) + (2)^2 \\cdot p^2$$\n$$\\operatorname{E}[G^2] = 2p(1-p) + 4p^2 = 2p - 2p^2 + 4p^2 = 2p + 2p^2$$\n\nThe variance of $G$ is given by the formula $\\operatorname{Var}(G) = \\operatorname{E}[G^2] - (\\operatorname{E}[G])^2$. Substituting the derived quantities:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(G) = (2p + 2p^2) - (2p)^2$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(G) = 2p + 2p^2 - 4p^2 = 2p - 2p^2$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(G) = 2p(1-p)$$\nThis is a standard result for the variance of an additively coded genotype under HWE.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(G)$ back into our simplified equation for $R^2$:\n$$R^2 = \\hat{\\beta}^2 \\cdot [2p(1-p)]$$\n$$R^2 = 2p(1-p)\\hat{\\beta}^2$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the proportion of variance explained by the single variant in terms of the minor allele frequency $p$ and the OLS estimated effect size $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n\nRegarding the interpretation of this result, $R^2$ represents the variant's contribution to the population's phenotypic variance. Since the trait is standardized ($\\operatorname{Var}(Y)=1$), the aformentioned $R^2$ is not just a proportion but also the absolute amount of variance explained by the genetic locus. The formula $R^2 = 2p(1-p)\\hat{\\beta}^2$ shows that this phenotypic impact is a product of two factors:\n1. $\\hat{\\beta}^2$: The squared per-allele effect size. Since $Y$ is standardized to have a standard deviation of $1$, $\\hat{\\beta}$ quantifies the change in the trait in standard deviation units for each additional minor allele. This term reflects the intrinsic biological or functional impact of the allele substitution.\n2. $2p(1-p)$: The variance of the genotype count $G$. This term is a function of the minor allele frequency $p$ and is maximized when $p=0.5$. It acts as a population-level scalar for the biological effect.\n\nThis relationship demonstrates that the overall contribution of a genetic variant to the heritable variance of a trait in a population depends critically on both its per-allele effect size ($\\beta$) and its frequency ($p$). A variant with a large biological effect (large $\\beta$) may explain very little population variance if it is very rare ($p \\to 0$). Conversely, a common variant ($p$ near $0.5$) can explain a substantial amount of variance even with a modest per-allele effect size. This is a fundamental principle in the interpretation of genome-wide association studies, highlighting why GWAS is well-powered to detect common variants of modest effect but struggles to find rare variants unless their effects are very large.",

Model and Parameter Definition**\n\nThe relationship between disease status ($Y=1$ for cases, $Y=0$ for controls) and genotype $G$ is described by a logistic regression model:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(Y=1|G)}{1 - P(Y=1|G)}\\right) = \\beta_0 + \\beta G $$\nThe parameter $\\beta$ is the log-odds of the disease per additional minor allele.

Wald Test and Noncentrality Parameter (NCP)**\n\nThe Wald test for the hypothesis $H_0: \\beta=0$ uses a test statistic $W = \\hat{\\beta} / \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{\\beta})$, which is approximately standard normal under the null. Under the alternative hypothesis $H_1: \\beta \\ne 0$, the squared statistic $W^2$ follows a non-central chi-squared distribution with 1 degree of freedom and a noncentrality parameter $\\lambda$. For a case-control study with total sample size $n$ and case fraction $\\phi$, the NCP is well-approximated by:\n$$ \\lambda = n \\phi (1-\\phi) \\mathrm{Var}_{pop}(G) \\beta^2 $$\nThis is the required expression for the NCP as a function of $n$.\n\n**4. Sample Size Calculation**\n\nTo achieve a statistical power of $1-\\beta_{err}=0.8$ for a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha=5 \\times 10^{-8}$, the required NCP $\\lambda$ must satisfy:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\lambda} \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} + z_{1-\\beta_{err}} $$\nwhere $z_q$ is the upper $q$-quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\nThe required quantiles are:\n- $z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{2.5 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 5.4513$\n- $z_{1-\\beta_{err}} = z_{0.8} \\approx 0.8416$\n\nThe required NCP is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx (5.4513 + 0.8416)^2 = (6.2929)^2 \\approx 39.6006 $$\n\nWe can now solve for the total sample size $n$ by rearranging the NCP expression. With balanced sampling ($\\phi=0.5$), $\\phi(1-\\phi)=0.25$.\n$$ n = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\phi(1-\\phi) \\mathrm{Var}_{pop}(G) \\beta^2} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{39.6006}{0.25 \\times 0.32 \\times (0.09531)^2} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{39.6006}{0.08 \\times 0.009084} $$\n$$ n \\approx \\frac{39.6006}{0.00072672} \\approx 54493 $$\nThe problem asks for the expected number of cases.

The $I^2$ value of $0.8018$ indicates that approximately $80.2\\%$ of the total variability in the observed effect sizes is attributable to true between-study heterogeneity rather than random sampling error. This level of heterogeneity is considered very high. The fixed-effect model's central assumption of a single common effect size is clearly violated. This substantial heterogeneity is plausibly explained by the factors described in the problem: the cohorts differ in both their ancestral composition (European, East Asian, African, Hispanic/Latino) and their phenotype ascertainment methods (clinician-adjudicated, ICD-code based, algorithmic, self-report). Differences in genetic architecture, linkage disequilibrium patterns, and allele frequencies across ancestries, as well as varying levels of misclassification in phenotype definitions, can lead to genuine differences in the true underlying genetic effect size. Therefore, a random-effects meta-analysis, which models and accounts for such between-study variance, would be a more appropriate statistical approach for synthesizing these results.",
