            "introduction": "While many statistical models naturally assess interaction on a multiplicative scale, understanding interaction on an additive scale is crucial for public health. Additive interaction relates to the absolute excess risk attributable to the combined presence of a genetic factor and an environmental exposure, providing insight into the public health impact of their interplay. This exercise  will guide you through the calculation and interpretation of key metrics for quantifying additive interaction from relative risk data, a fundamental skill in epidemiologic research.",

            "problem": "A large prospective cohort study in precision medicine investigates the joint effect of a binary genetic variant and a binary environmental exposure on the incidence of a complex disease. Let $G \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote absence or presence of the risk allele and $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote absence or presence of the environmental exposure. Let $\\mathrm{RR}_{ij}$ denote the Relative Risk (RR) comparing the disease risk in group $(G=i,E=j)$ to the unexposed reference group $(G=0,E=0)$, so that by definition $\\mathrm{RR}_{00}=1$.

            "solution": "Let $R_{ij}$ be the risk of disease for individuals with genetic status $G=i$ and environmental status $E=j$. The reference group is $(G=0, E=0)$ with risk $R_{00}$. The relative risk (RR) is defined as $\\mathrm{RR}_{ij} = R_{ij} / R_{00}$. We are given the following adjusted relative risks:\n- $\\mathrm{RR}_{11}=3.0$\n- $\\mathrm{RR}_{10}=1.5$\n- $\\mathrm{RR}_{01}=1.8$\nBy definition, $\\mathrm{RR}_{00}=1$.\n\nAdditive interaction is assessed by comparing risk differences. An absence of additive interaction means that the excess risk from the joint exposure is simply the sum of the excess risks from the individual exposures:\n$$ (R_{11} - R_{00}) = (R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00}) $$\nThe measures of additive interaction quantify the departure from this assumption.\n\n**1. Relative Excess Risk due to Interaction (RERI)**\nRERI is the interaction term normalized by the baseline risk $R_{00}$, expressed on the scale of relative risks. It is derived by dividing the interaction risk difference, $I = (R_{11} - R_{00}) - [(R_{10} - R_{00}) + (R_{01} - R_{00})]$, by the baseline risk $R_{00}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{RERI} = \\frac{R_{11}}{R_{00}} - \\frac{R_{10}}{R_{00}} - \\frac{R_{01}}{R_{00}} + \\frac{R_{00}}{R_{00}} = \\mathrm{RR}_{11} - \\mathrm{RR}_{10} - \\mathrm{RR}_{01} + 1 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\mathrm{RERI} = 3.0 - 1.5 - 1.8 + 1 = 0.7 $$\n\n**2. Attributable Proportion due to interaction (AP)**\nAP is the proportion of risk in the doubly exposed group ($G=1, E=1$) that is attributable to the interaction itself. It is given by the formula:\n$$ \\mathrm{AP} = \\frac{\\mathrm{RERI}}{\\mathrm{RR}_{11}} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\mathrm{AP} = \\frac{0.7}{3.0} \\approx 0.233333... $$\n\n**3. Synergy Index (S)**\nThe Synergy Index compares the observed excess relative risk for the joint exposure to the sum of the excess relative risks for the individual exposures.\n$$ S = \\frac{\\mathrm{RR}_{11} - 1}{(\\mathrm{RR}_{10} - 1) + (\\mathrm{RR}_{01} - 1)} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ S = \\frac{3.0 - 1}{(1.5 - 1) + (1.8 - 1)} = \\frac{2.0}{0.5 + 0.8} = \\frac{2.0}{1.3} \\approx 1.53846... $$\n\n**Interpretation and Final Values**\nThe null values indicating no additive interaction are $\\mathrm{RERI}=0$, $\\mathrm{AP}=0$, and $S=1$. Our calculated values ($\\mathrm{RERI} = 0.7 > 0$, $\\mathrm{AP} \\approx 0.2333 > 0$, $S \\approx 1.538 > 1$) all consistently indicate a positive additive interaction, or synergy. This means the combined effect of the gene and exposure is greater than the sum of their individual effects. Specifically, the excess relative risk from the interaction is 0.7; about 23.3% of the risk among those with both factors is due to their synergistic interaction; and the joint excess risk is about 1.54 times what would be expected if the individual excess risks were merely additive.\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures, we get:\n- $\\mathrm{RERI} = 0.7000$\n- $\\mathrm{AP} = 0.2333$\n- $S = 1.538$",

            "problem": "A research team in precision medicine seeks to efficiently estimate a gene-by-environment (GxE) interaction for a complex disease using a design that samples only affected individuals. Let $D \\in \\{0,1\\}$ denote disease status, $G \\in \\{0,1\\}$ a bi-allelic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; coded $1$ for risk-allele carrier and $0$ otherwise), and $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$ a binary environmental exposure. Consider the foundational setup in which disease odds are modeled on the multiplicative scale via a logistic risk model that allows an interaction between $G$ and $E$, that is, the conditional disease odds satisfy\n$$\\operatorname{odds}\\{D=1 \\mid G,E\\} = \\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G G + \\beta_E E + \\beta_{GE} G E\\},$$\nso that the multiplicative interaction on the disease odds ratio (OR) scale is $\\exp(\\beta_{GE})$.

No other shortcuts should be assumed.\n\nThe team is considering a “case-only” approach. Using only the above fundamentals, reason about what the case-only design must do and what assumption it fundamentally requires in order to identify the multiplicative GxE interaction. Which option most accurately defines the case-only design for GxE estimation and states the core independence assumption it relies on, together with what is and is not identifiable under that design?\n\nA. The case-only design enrolls only individuals with $D=1$ and estimates the association between $G$ and $E$ among cases (for example, by regressing $G$ on $E$ within $D=1$) to infer the multiplicative GxE interaction on the disease OR scale. Its core assumption is that $G$ and $E$ are independent in the source population that gives rise to cases, i.e., $P(G,E)=P(G)P(E)$. Under this assumption, the $G$–$E$ odds ratio among cases identifies $\\exp(\\beta_{GE})$. Main (marginal) effects of $G$ and of $E$ on $D$ are not identifiable from case-only data.\n\nB. The case-only design enrolls equal numbers of individuals with $D=1$ and $D=0$ and fits a logistic model $\\operatorname{logit} P(D=1 \\mid G,E)$ including the $G E$ product term. Its core assumption is that $G$ and $E$ are independent among the cases, i.e., $P(G,E \\mid D=1)=P(G \\mid D=1)P(E \\mid D=1)$. Under this assumption, both the interaction and the main effects are consistently estimable.\n\nC. The case-only design enrolls only individuals with $D=1$ and assumes that $G$ and $E$ are independent among the controls, $P(G,E \\mid D=0)=P(G \\mid D=0)P(E \\mid D=0)$, together with the rare-disease approximation. Under these conditions it identifies an additive interaction on the risk difference scale.\n\nD. The case-only design enrolls only $D=1$ and requires Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium for $G$ and no linkage disequilibrium with other loci, as well as random assignment of $E$. Under those conditions, the $G$–$E$ association among cases identifies the interaction on the risk ratio scale, and main effects are also unbiasedly estimable.",
            "solution": "We begin from first principles: (i) basic probability, (ii) Bayes’ theorem, (iii) independence, and (iv) the odds ratio definition.

The case-only design samples only from $D=1$ and examines the association between $G$ and $E$ among cases, with the idea that this association, under a core independence assumption in the source population, reflects the interaction parameter. Define the odds ratio for association between $G$ and $E$ within the case subset as\n$$\\operatorname{OR}_{GE \\mid D=1} = \\frac{P(G=1,E=1 \\mid D=1)\\, P(G=0,E=0 \\mid D=1)}{P(G=1,E=0 \\mid D=1)\\, P(G=0,E=1 \\mid D=1)}.$$\nBy Bayes’ theorem,\n$$P(G=g,E=e \\mid D=1) = \\frac{P(D=1 \\mid g,e)\\, P(G=g, E=e)}{P(D=1)}.$$\nTherefore,\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{OR}_{GE \\mid D=1}\n&= \\frac{\\big[P(D=1 \\mid 1,1)\\, P(G=1,E=1)\\big]\\big[P(D=1 \\mid 0,0)\\, P(G=0,E=0)\\big]}{\\big[P(D=1 \\mid 1,0)\\, P(G=1,E=0)\\big]\\big[P(D=1 \\mid 0,1)\\, P(G=0,E=1)\\big]}.\n\\end{align*}\nIf $G$ and $E$ are independent in the source population (the population that gives rise to cases), then $P(G,E)=P(G)P(E)$, and the $P(G)P(E)$ terms cancel in the cross-product, yielding\n$$\\operatorname{OR}_{GE \\mid D=1} = \\frac{P(D=1 \\mid 1,1)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,0)}{P(D=1 \\mid 1,0)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,1)}.$$\nExpress each $P(D=1 \\mid g,e)$ in odds form via the logistic model. Since\n$$\\frac{P(D=1 \\mid g,e)}{P(D=0 \\mid g,e)} = \\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G g + \\beta_E e + \\beta_{GE} g e\\},$$\nit follows that\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P(D=1 \\mid 1,1)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,0)}{P(D=1 \\mid 1,0)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,1)}\n&= \\frac{\\frac{\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G + \\beta_E + \\beta_{GE}\\}}{1+\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G + \\beta_E + \\beta_{GE}\\}} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp\\{\\alpha\\}}{1+\\exp\\{\\alpha\\}}}{\\frac{\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G\\}}{1+\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G\\}} \\cdot \\frac{\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_E\\}}{1+\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_E\\}}}.\n\\end{align*}\nA more transparent route is to work directly with odds, since the odds ratios will cancel nuisance factors. Define\n$$\\mathcal{O}(g,e) = \\frac{P(D=1 \\mid g,e)}{P(D=0 \\mid g,e)} = \\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G g + \\beta_E e + \\beta_{GE} g e\\}.$$\nThen\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{P(D=1 \\mid 1,1)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,0)}{P(D=1 \\mid 1,0)\\, P(D=1 \\mid 0,1)}\n&= \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\, P(D=0 \\mid 1,1)\\ \\cdot\\ \\mathcal{O}(0,0)\\, P(D=0 \\mid 0,0)}{\\mathcal{O}(1,0)\\, P(D=0 \\mid 1,0)\\ \\cdot\\ \\mathcal{O}(0,1)\\, P(D=0 \\mid 0,1)}.\n\\end{align*}\nSince each $P(D=0 \\mid g,e)$ cancels with its counterpart in the cross-product ratio when forming the odds of the odds, we obtain the standard simplification:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\operatorname{OR}_{GE \\mid D=1}\n&= \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(1,1)\\, \\mathcal{O}(0,0)}{\\mathcal{O}(1,0)\\, \\mathcal{O}(0,1)} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G + \\beta_E + \\beta_{GE}\\}\\, \\exp\\{\\alpha\\}}{\\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_G\\}\\, \\exp\\{\\alpha + \\beta_E\\}} \\\\\n&= \\exp\\{\\beta_{GE}\\}.\n\\end{align*}\nThus, under the single core assumption that $G$ and $E$ are independent in the source population, $P(G,E)=P(G)P(E)$, the odds ratio for the $G$–$E$ association among cases identifies the multiplicative GxE interaction on the disease OR scale, $\\exp(\\beta_{GE})$. This derivation uses only Bayes’ theorem, the definition of independence, and the logistic multiplicative odds model.\n\nIdentifiability and limitations. Because the case-only design conditions on $D=1$ and uses the induced $G$–$E$ association among cases, it does not identify the main effects $\\beta_G$ or $\\beta_E$; those cancel in the cross-product ratio under independence. Therefore, main (marginal) genetic and environmental effects on $D$ cannot be recovered from case-only data alone. Efficiency is gained for interaction estimation, but at the cost of relying on the independence assumption. If $G$ and $E$ are correlated in the source population (for example, via population stratification or gene–environment correlation), the case-only estimator is biased. Notably, a rare-disease assumption is not required for this odds ratio–scale result, and the assumption concerns independence in the source population, not independence within the case subset or the control subset.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n- Option A: Accurately defines the case-only design as sampling only $D=1$ and modeling the $G$–$E$ association among cases; states the correct core assumption $P(G,E)=P(G)P(E)$ in the source population; identifies that $\\operatorname{OR}_{GE \\mid D=1} = \\exp(\\beta_{GE})$ under that assumption; and correctly notes that main effects are not identifiable. Verdict — Correct.\n- Option B: Describes a case–control design, not a case-only design, since it enrolls both $D=1$ and $D=0$. It also incorrectly places the independence assumption among cases, $P(G,E \\mid D=1)=P(G \\mid D=1)P(E \\mid D=1)$, which is neither required nor generally true, and wrongly claims main effects are consistently estimable under that assumption in a case-only analysis. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option C: Places the independence assumption among controls, $P(G,E \\mid D=0)$, and adds a rare-disease approximation, then asserts identification of an additive interaction on the risk difference scale. The core case-only assumption is independence in the source population, not specifically among controls, and the design targets the multiplicative interaction on the odds ratio scale without requiring a rare-disease approximation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n- Option D: Invokes Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, lack of linkage disequilibrium, and random assignment of $E$ as the “core” conditions, and claims identification on the risk ratio scale with main effects estimable. These are not the defining assumptions of the case-only estimator for multiplicative interaction; random assignment of $E$ is generally unrealistic, and main effects remain non-identifiable from cases only. Verdict — Incorrect.",
