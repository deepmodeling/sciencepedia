            "problem": "A cohort-based allele frequency assessment is being performed for an autosomal single-nucleotide variant in a population-scale dataset used for precision medicine. Consider the following scientifically realistic setting:\n\n- There are $10{,}000$ unrelated diploid human genomes, each contributing $2$ alleles at an autosomal locus. There are no missing genotypes and no copy-number alterations affecting the locus.\n- Across all chromosomes sampled in the cohort, the alternate allele is observed $50$ times.\n- Use the canonical definition of allele frequency: for any allele at a locus, its frequency in the cohort equals the count of that allele divided by the total number of alleles assayed at that locus.\n- The minor allele frequency is defined as the frequency of the less common allele among the reference and alternate alleles at that locus in the cohort.\n- For categorizing rarity, use the following Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)-style frequency bins, indexed by $1,2,3,4,5$:\n  - Bin $1$ (extremely rare): $0 < \\mathrm{MAF} < 10^{-4}$.\n  - Bin $2$ (very rare): $10^{-4} \\le \\mathrm{MAF} < 10^{-3}$.\n  - Bin $3$ (rare): $10^{-3} \\le \\mathrm{MAF} < 10^{-2}$.\n  - Bin $4$ (low-frequency): $10^{-2} \\le \\mathrm{MAF} < 10^{-1}$.\n  - Bin $5$ (common): $10^{-1} \\le \\mathrm{MAF} \\le 5 \\times 10^{-1}$.\n\nStarting only from these fundamental definitions and facts, compute the minor allele frequency for this variant and determine its rarity category by bin index using the bins above.

            "problem": "A laboratory is evaluating a single-nucleotide variant in a gene with an established autosomal dominant disease mechanism. The variant is a canonical stop-gain change early in the coding sequence, specifically a cytosine-to-thymine transition at position $c.412\\mathrm{C} \\to \\mathrm{T}$ producing $p.\\mathrm{Arg}138^{*}$ in a gene where heterozygous loss of function is a well-established mechanism of disease. Aggregated submissions to the Clinical Variant database (ClinVar) document the variant in $k = 8$ unrelated probands with a highly specific and concordant phenotype for the gene-associated disorder. A large control cohort from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) comprising $N_{0} = 250{,}000$ alleles shows $0$ observations of this variant and no homozygotes. Multiple independent in silico tools predict the variant to be deleterious due to introduction of a premature termination codon that is expected to trigger nonsense-mediated decay. Assume that the observed case enrichment, rarity in controls, and mechanistic plausibility together satisfy one very strong, one strong, one moderate, and one supporting American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) pathogenic criteria, respectively, under standard laboratory practice, and that no benign criteria are met.\n\nAdopt a Bayesian classification framework for ACMG criteria as recommended by the ClinGen Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working Group, and assume a prior probability of pathogenicity $P_{\\mathrm{prior}} = \\frac{1}{19}$ for a randomly selected rare missense or truncating variant in this gene. Using Bayes’ theorem and treating the ACMG evidence categories as conditionally independent for the purposes of likelihood combination, compute the posterior probability of pathogenicity $P_{\\mathrm{post}}$ for this variant. Round your final numeric answer to four significant figures and express it as a unitless decimal (do not use a percentage sign).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the posterior probability of pathogenicity for a genetic variant, $P_{\\mathrm{post}}$, using a Bayesian framework. The calculation begins with a prior probability and updates it based on several pieces of evidence. The most efficient way to combine evidence in this framework is to use the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe posterior odds of an event are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio(s) from the evidence:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pathogenic}|\\text{Evidence}) = \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pathogenic}) \\times \\text{LR}(\\text{Evidence}) $$\nwhere $\\text{Odds}(A) = \\frac{P(A)}{1 - P(A)}$, and LR is the likelihood ratio.\n\nFirst, we convert the given prior probability, $P_{\\mathrm{prior}}$, into prior odds.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{prior}} = P(\\text{Pathogenic}) = \\frac{1}{19} $$\nThe prior odds of pathogenicity are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{prior}} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{prior}}}{1 - P_{\\mathrm{prior}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{19}}{1 - \\frac{1}{19}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{19}}{\\frac{18}{19}} = \\frac{1}{18} $$\n\nNext, we identify the likelihood ratios associated with each piece of evidence. The problem states that the variant meets one very strong, one strong, one moderate, and one supporting pathogenic criterion. The ClinGen SVI working group has calibrated these evidence strengths to specific quantitative likelihood ratios, termed Odds of Pathogenicity (OddsPath):\n-   Very Strong (VS) evidence corresponds to an OddsPath of $350:1$, so $LR_{\\mathrm{VS}} = 350$.\n-   Strong (S) evidence corresponds to an OddsPath of $18.7:1$, so $LR_{\\mathrm{S}} = 18.7$.\n-   Moderate (M) evidence corresponds to an OddsPath of $4.3:1$, so $LR_{\\mathrm{M}} = 4.3$.\n-   Supporting (P) evidence corresponds to an OddsPath of $2.08:1$, so $LR_{\\mathrm{P}} = 2.08$.\n\nThe problem states we can assume conditional independence, which means the total likelihood ratio for the combined evidence, $LR_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{\\mathrm{total}} = LR_{\\mathrm{VS}} \\times LR_{\\mathrm{S}} \\times LR_{\\mathrm{M}} \\times LR_{\\mathrm{P}} $$\n$$ LR_{\\mathrm{total}} = 350 \\times 18.7 \\times 4.3 \\times 2.08 $$\nCalculating this product:\n$$ LR_{\\mathrm{total}} = 6545 \\times 8.944 = 58533.08 $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the posterior odds of pathogenicity by multiplying the prior odds by the total likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{prior}} \\times LR_{\\mathrm{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{1}{18} \\times 58533.08 \\approx 3251.8378 $$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back into a probability, $P_{\\mathrm{post}}$. The relationship between probability $P$ and odds $O$ is $P = \\frac{O}{1 + O}$.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\mathrm{post}}} $$\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\frac{3251.8378}{1 + 3251.8378} = \\frac{3251.8378}{3252.8378} \\approx 0.99969259 $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{post}} \\approx 0.9997 $$\nThis result indicates that the probability of the variant being pathogenic is greater than $99.9\\%$, which according to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, is sufficient to classify the variant as \"Pathogenic\".",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The core of the problem involves calculating the expected variant allele fraction (VAF) under two different biological hypotheses and then using Bayesian inference to determine which hypothesis is better supported by the sequencing data.\n\nThe first step is to derive a general formula for the expected VAF, which we denote as $\\theta$. The sample is a mixture of tumor cells (at a fraction, or purity, of $p$) and normal cells (at a fraction of $1-p$). The VAF is the ratio of the number of variant (mutant) alleles to the total number of alleles at the locus of interest, aggregated across the entire cell population.\n\nLet $c$ be the number of copies of the variant allele in a single tumor cell.\nLet $t$ be the total copy number (total number of alleles) at the locus in a single tumor cell.\nLet $t_{norm}$ be the total copy number at the locus in a single normal cell.
