            "problem": "A clinical laboratory is annotating a single-nucleotide variant at the boundary of an exon in a cancer predisposition gene. The laboratory uses the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) recommendations for variant nomenclature in coding DNA sequence coordinates. Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) defines coding DNA sequence coordinates as follows: the adenine of the initiation codon is `c.1`, exonic nucleotides are numbered consecutively across the transcript, and intronic nucleotides are described relative to the nearest exon boundary. From the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology, a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcript is formed by splicing exons together and removing introns; therefore, coding DNA sequence coordinates across exons reflect the spliced transcript.\n\nConsider a transcript with $3$ exons. Exon $1$ is entirely untranslated. Exon $2$ has length $220$ bases, and the start codon begins at the $10$th base of exon $2$. Exon $3$ has length $134$ bases and is entirely coding. Sanger sequencing shows a guanine-to-adenine substitution affecting the last nucleotide of exon $3$. The intron following exon $3$ begins with the canonical dinucleotide guanine-thymine.\n\nUsing only the foundational definitions above, determine the correct HGVS coding DNA sequence annotation for this variant and justify the choice based on splice boundary anchoring.\n\nChoose the single best option:\n\nA. `c.345G>A`\n\nB. `c.345+1G>A`\n\nC. `c.344+2G>A`\n\nD. `c.345-1G>A`\n\nE. `c.IVS3+1G>A`",
            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\nThe problem provides the following information and definitions for Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature in coding DNA sequence (cDNA) coordinates:\n*   The adenine of the initiation codon is designated `c.1`.\n*   Exonic nucleotides are numbered consecutively across the spliced transcript.\n*   Intronic nucleotides are described relative to the nearest exon boundary.\n*   The transcript under consideration has $3$ exons.\n*   Exon $1$ is entirely untranslated.\n*   Exon $2$ has a length of $220$ bases.\n*   The start codon begins at the $10$th base of exon $2$.\n*   Exon $3$ has a length of $134$ bases and is entirely coding.\n*   The variant is a guanine-to-adenine substitution ($G>A$).\n*   The substitution affects the last nucleotide of exon $3$.\n*   The intron following exon $3$ begins with the canonical dinucleotide guanine-thymine ($GT$).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the fundamental principles of molecular biology, including gene structure (exons, introns), transcription, splicing, and the genetic code (start codons). It uses the established and widely accepted HGVS standard for variant nomenclature, which is a cornerstone of genomic diagnostics and precision medicine. The information, such as the canonical `GT` splice donor site, is factually correct.\n*   **Well-Posed:** All necessary information to determine the variant's coordinate is provided. The rules for cDNA numbering are explicitly stated. The lengths of the relevant exons and the position of the start codon are given, allowing for a unique calculation. The question asks for a specific annotation based on these rules.\n*   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language with no subjective or ambiguous terms. The data points (e.g., exon lengths) are quantitative and objective.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is a direct application of a standard nomenclature system to a defined genetic structure.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Annotation\n\nThe task is to determine the correct HGVS cDNA annotation for a substitution at the last nucleotide of exon $3$, according to the provided rules.\n\n1.  **Establish the Reference Point:** The foundational rule is that the adenine of the initiation (start) codon is numbered `c.1`.\n\n2.  **Determine the Start of the Coding Sequence:** The problem states that the start codon begins at the $10$th base of exon $2$. This implies that the first $9$ bases of exon $2$ are part of the $5'$ untranslated region ($5'$ UTR). The coding sequence, therefore, starts at this position.\n\n3.  **Calculate the Length of the Coding Sequence (CDS) in Exon 2:** Exon $2$ has a total length of $220$ bases. Since the first $9$ bases are non-coding, the number of coding bases in exon $2$ is the total length minus the length of the $5'$ UTR segment within that exon.\n    Length of CDS in Exon $2 = 220 - 9 = 211$ bases.\n    These bases are numbered consecutively from `c.1` to `c.211`. Thus, the last coding nucleotide of exon $2$ corresponds to the cDNA position `c.211`.\n\n4.  **Calculate the Position of the Variant:** The problem states that exon $3$ is entirely coding and has a length of $134$ bases. According to HGVS rules, the numbering of exonic nucleotides is consecutive across the spliced transcript. Therefore, the numbering for exon $3$ begins immediately after the last coding nucleotide of exon $2$.\n    *   The last coding position in exon $2$ is `c.211`.\n    *   The first coding position in exon $3$ is `c.(211 + 1) = c.212`.\n    *   The variant affects the *last* nucleotide of exon $3$. To find its position, we add the length of the coding sequence in exon $3$ to the position of the last base of the preceding coding exon.\n    *   Position of the last nucleotide of exon $3 = 211 + 134 = 345$.\n    The coordinate of the affected nucleotide is therefore `c.345`.\n\n5.  **Formulate the HGVS Annotation:** The variant is a guanine-to-adenine substitution ($G>A$) at this calculated position. For a substitution, the HGVS format is `c.[position][reference_allele]>[alternative_allele]`.\n    *   Position: $345$\n    *   Reference allele: Guanine ($G$)\n    *   Alternative allele: Adenine ($A$)\n    The complete annotation is `c.345G>A`.\n\n6.  **Justification Based on Splice Boundary Anchoring:** The problem specifically asks for justification based on splice boundary anchoring. The HGVS rules clearly distinguish between variants *within* an exon and variants *within* an intron.\n    *   A nucleotide that is part of the exon sequence, even the very last one at the exon-intron junction, is described by its absolute position in the cDNA sequence (e.g., `c.345`).\n    *   A nucleotide that is part of the intron sequence is described relative to the nearest exon boundary using a `+` or `-` offset. For example, the first nucleotide of the intron following the exon that ends at `c.345` would be `c.345+1`. The second nucleotide of that intron would be `c.345+2`.\n    Since the problem explicitly states the substitution affects \"the last nucleotide of exon $3$\", it is, by definition, part of the exon. Therefore, it must be assigned an exonic coordinate, `c.345`, not an intronic one with a `+` offset. The information that the following intron begins with a canonical `GT` dinucleotide confirms that position `c.345` is the splice donor site's last exonic base, which is a position of high biological significance, but this does not change the nomenclature rule.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. `c.345G>A`**: This annotation correctly identifies the position of the last nucleotide of exon $3$ as `c.345` (derived from the sum of coding lengths of exon $2$ ($211$ bases) and exon $3$ ($134$ bases)). It correctly describes a guanine-to-adenine substitution at this exonic location. This matches our derivation precisely.\n    **Verdict: Correct**\n\n*   **B. `c.345+1G>A`**: This notation describes a variant at the *first* nucleotide of the intron immediately following the coding sequence that ends at position `c.345`. The problem states the variant is in the exon, not the intron.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **C. `c.344+2G>A`**: This notation describes a variant at the *second* nucleotide of the intron following the exon boundary. Furthermore, it incorrectly anchors this intron to position `c.344`, which is the second-to-last nucleotide of exon $3$. The problem states the variant is in the exon at the last nucleotide.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. `c.345-1G>A`**: This notation describes a variant at the *first* nucleotide upstream of position `c.345`. If `c.345` is in exon $3$, `c.345-1` would refer to the last nucleotide of the intron preceding exon $3$. The variant is located in exon $3$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **E. `c.IVS3+1G>A`**: This uses `IVS` (Intervening Sequence) nomenclature, which is an obsolete synonym for intron. HGVS has deprecated this format. Even if interpreted, `IVS3+1` would mean the first nucleotide of the third intron (the one following exon $3$), which is the same location as `c.345+1`. As established, the variant is in the exon, not the intron.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**",

These are fundamental tools in modern genomics and precision medicine. The concepts of genomic vs. cDNA coordinates, transcript strand, left-normalization, and 3'-normalization are all scientifically sound and well-defined.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to arrive at a unique solution. It gives a VCF record defining a genomic alteration, the local reference sequence necessary for normalization, a clear mapping between genomic and cDNA coordinate systems (`c.1` = $g=2401$), and the specific normalization rule to apply (HGVS 3' rule). The goal is a single, determinable integer.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n*   **Consistency:** The provided VCF record (REF=\"GAA\" at POS=$2499$) is consistent with the local reference sequence (5'-GAAAAAAT-3' starting at $g=2499$). The REF allele 'GAA' correctly matches the bases at genomic positions $g=2499$, $g=2500$, and $g=2501$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**2. Solution**\n\nThe problem requires a three-step process: first, interpreting the VCF record to understand the genomic variant; second, applying the HGVS 3'-normalization rule to this variant; and third, converting the resulting genomic coordinates to HGVS coding DNA ($c.$) coordinates.\n\n**Step 1: Interpretation of the VCF Record**\nThe VCF record is given as: `POS=$2499$`, `REF=\"GAA\"`, `ALT=\"G\"`.\nIn VCF format for deletions, the `POS` field indicates the first reference base. The `REF` allele contains this anchor base plus the sequence that is deleted. The `ALT` allele contains only the anchor base.\n-   `POS` = $2499$ is the genomic coordinate of the first base in `REF`.\n-   `REF` = \"GAA\" starts at $g=2499$.\n-   `ALT` = \"G\" is the allele after the change.\n\nBy comparing the `REF` and `ALT` alleles, we see that the sequence \"AA\" is deleted. The anchor base \"G\" remains. The `REF` allele \"GAA\" corresponds to genomic positions $g=2499$, $g=2500$, and $g=2501$. The deleted portion, \"AA\", therefore corresponds to genomic positions $g=2500$ and $g=2501$. This variant, in its left-normalized form as represented by the VCF file, is a deletion of two nucleotides: `g.2500_2501del`.\n\n**Step 2: Application of the HGVS 3'-Normalization Rule**\nThe HGVS nomenclature standards require that for variants in repetitive sequences, the variant should be described at the most $3'$ (three-prime) position possible. This is also known as right-shifting or 3'-shifting the variant.\n\nThe deleted sequence is \"AA\". We must examine the genomic reference sequence to find the repetitive context. The given sequence from $g=2499$ to $g=2506$ is `5'-GAAAAAAT-3'`. This corresponds to:\n-   $g=2499$: G\n-   $g=2500$: A\n-   $g=2501$: A\n-   $g=2502$: A\n-   $g=2503$: A\n-   $g=2504$: A\n-   $g=2505$: A\n-   $g=2506$: T\n\nThe deletion of \"AA\" at `g.2500_2501del` occurs within a run of six 'A's from $g=2500$ to $g=2505$. We must shift this deletion as far to the right (in the $3'$ direction) as possible while maintaining the same resulting sequence.\n\n-   Original `g.2500_2501del`: `G` `(del A A)` `A A A A` `T` -> Resulting sequence: `GAAAAT`\n-   Shift 1 position right to `g.2501_2502del`: `G` `A` `(del A A)` `A A A` `T` -> Resulting sequence: `GAAAAT` (Identical)\n-   Shift 2 positions right to `g.2502_2503del`: `G` `A A` `(del A A)` `A A` `T` -> Resulting sequence: `GAAAAT` (Identical)\n-   Shift 3 positions right to `g.2503_2504del`: `G` `A A A` `(del A A)` `A` `T` -> Resulting sequence: `GAAAAT` (Identical)\n-   Shift 4 positions right to `g.2504_2505del`: `G` `A A A A` `(del A A)` `T` -> Resulting sequence: `GAAAAT` (Identical)\n\nIf we attempt to shift further to `g.2505_2506del`, we would be deleting \"AT\", which is not the same variant. Thus, the most 3'-shifted position for the deletion of \"AA\" is `g.2504_2505del`. This is the correct HGVS representation at the genomic level.\n\n**Step 3: Conversion to HGVS cDNA Coordinates**\nThe problem states that the transcript `NM_TX001` is on the positive strand. This implies that the cDNA coordinates ($c.$) increase in the same direction as the genomic coordinates ($g.$), simplifying the conversion to a linear transformation.\n\nWe are given the mapping anchor: `c.1` corresponds to $g=2401$.\nThe relationship between a genomic coordinate $g$ and its corresponding cDNA coordinate $c$ can be expressed as:\n$c = g - \\text{offset}$\nUsing the anchor point, we can find the offset.\n$1 = 2401 - \\text{offset}$\n$\\text{offset} = 2401 - 1 = 2400$\nSo, the conversion formula is $c = g - 2400$.\n\nWe need to find the starting `c.` coordinate for the 3'-normalized deletion, which is `g.2504_2505del`. The starting genomic coordinate is $g_{\\text{start}} = 2504$.\n\nUsing the conversion formula, we find the corresponding starting cDNA coordinate, $c_{\\text{start}}$:\n$c_{\\text{start}} = g_{\\text{start}} - 2400$\n$c_{\\text{start}} = 2504 - 2400 = 104$\n\nThe full HGVS cDNA description of the variant would be `c.104_105del`. The problem asks only for the starting `c.` coordinate.\n\nThe starting `c.` coordinate is $104$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a single-nucleotide deletion at the first position of a coding DNA sequence (`c.1`), based on the principles of molecular biology and the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature. We must first validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The system is a protein-coding transcript.\n-   The analysis must follow HGVS standards for coding DNA (`c.`) and protein (`p.`) nomenclature.\n-   The coding DNA numbering starts with `c.1` at the adenine (`A`) of the canonical `ATG` start codon.\n-   The protein annotation starts with Methionine (`Met` or `M`) at position `1`, encoded by the `ATG` start codon.\n-   The wild-type protein has a curator-annotated signal peptide of length `23` amino acids.\n-   The variant is a single-nucleotide deletion at `c.1`.\n-   The analysis must use only foundational principles: the Central Dogma, the triplet genetic code, and HGVS rules.\n-   No additional experimental evidence about translation initiation, re-initiation, or alternative start sites is to be used.\n-   The objective is to compute `N`, defined as the number of amino acid residues for which a change in identity can be unambiguously asserted under HGVS rules.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of molecular genetics (Central Dogma, genetic code) and a formal standard (HGVS nomenclature). The scenario of a deletion in a start codon is a plausible genetic event. The constraints are clearly defined, particularly the exclusion of experimental data on translation re-initiation, which properly frames the problem as one of theoretical prediction based on established rules. The question is formalizable and asks for a specific, calculable integer `N` based on these rules. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies in the premises. The problem tests the rigorous application of nomenclature rules in a situation of induced uncertainty.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the determination of `N`, the number of amino acid residues for which a change in identity can be unambiguously asserted following a `c.1del` variant. This requires a step-by-step application of molecular biology principles and HGVS rules.\n\n1.  **Characterization of the Variant at the DNA Level:**\n    The variant is a single-nucleotide deletion at position `c.1`. According to HGVS nomenclature, this is described as `c.1del`. Since the problem states that `c.1` is the adenine (`A`) of the canonical start codon, the full specific description is `c.1delA`. This description is unambiguous at the DNA level.\n\n2.  **Analysis of the Effect on Translation Initiation (The Central Dogma):**\n    The Central Dogma dictates that a DNA sequence is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into a protein. Translation initiation in eukaryotes robustly occurs at the first `AUG` codon on the mRNA molecule, which corresponds to the `ATG` codon in the coding DNA sequence. This `ATG` codon occupies positions `c.1`, `c.2`, and `c.3`. The deletion of the nucleotide at `c.1` transforms the start codon from `ATG` (mRNA: `AUG`) into `TG...` (mRNA: `UG...`). The canonical initiation signal is thereby destroyed.\n\n3.  **Application of HGVS Rules for Protein-Level Description:**\n    The core of the problem lies in how to describe the consequence at the protein level (`p.`). The problem explicitly forbids making any assumptions about alternative translation start sites or re-initiation events. We must rely solely on what can be predicted with certainty.\n    -   The wild-type protein begins with Methionine at position `1` (`p.Met1`).\n    -   The `c.1del` variant abolishes the codon for `p.Met1`.\n    -   Without the canonical start codon, the translational machinery may fail to initiate protein synthesis entirely. Alternatively, it might scan downstream and initiate at a different, non-canonical start site or the next available `AUG` codon.\n    -   Because the outcome is unknown without experimental evidence, HGVS nomenclature has a specific rule for this situation. Variants that affect the translation initiation codon, where it is unknown whether any protein is produced, are described as `p.0?`. Alternatively, `p.Met1?` can be used to indicate the specific loss of the initiator methionine with unknown consequences. Both notations signify profound uncertainty. The notation `p.0?` most accurately reflects the fact that we cannot even be certain that a protein product exists.\n\n4.  **Determining the Value of `N`:**\n    We are asked to find `N`, \"the number of amino acid residues for which a change in identity can be unambiguously asserted\".\n    -   To \"assert a change in identity\" for a residue at a specific position (e.g., position `i`), one must be able to state that the wild-type amino acid `X_i` has been replaced by a different, specified amino acid `Y_i`. This is the case in a missense variant, e.g., `p.Ala25Gly`, where we assert one change.\n    -   In a frameshift variant (e.g., `p.Ala25fs`), we are asserting that the residue at position `25` is no longer Alanine and that all subsequent residues in the predicted new frame are also different until a stop codon is reached. One could argue that a change is asserted for at least the first affected residue.\n    -   However, the `c.1del` variant is a special case. The HGVS-compliant description is `p.0?` (\"unknown effect\"). This notation is an explicit statement of ignorance. We are asserting that we *cannot* predict the outcome.\n    -   We cannot assert that `p.Met1` changes to another amino acid, because we do not know if translation even occurs.\n    -   We cannot assert a frameshift beginning at position `1` (e.g., `p.Met1fs`), because the very reference point for protein translation—the start codon—has been removed. A frameshift description assumes translation initiates and then proceeds in an altered reading frame. Here, initiation itself is the unknown.\n    -   Since the predicted consequence is formally \"unknown\", we cannot unambiguously assert a change in identity for any amino acid residue. The identity of the residue at position `1` is unknown, as is the identity of the residue at position `2`, and so on for the entire potential length of the protein. The existence of the protein sequence itself is not asserted.\n    -   Therefore, the number of residues for which a change in identity can be asserted is zero.\n\n5.  **Implications for Signal Peptide Annotation:**\n    The wild-type protein has a signal peptide comprising the first `23` amino acids. Since the `c.1del` variant abolishes the start of translation, the synthesis of the wild-type N-terminus, including the entire signal peptide, is predicted to be completely abrogated. This has severe biological consequences, as the protein, even if a truncated version were to be produced from a downstream start site, would lack its signal for secretion and would likely be mislocalized and non-functional. This consideration reinforces the severity of the variant but does not alter the logical deduction for `N`.\n\nIn conclusion, based on a rigorous application of HGVS nomenclature under the specified constraint of no experimental data, the protein-level effect is described as `p.0?`. This description signifies a state of uncertainty. Consequently, it is not possible to unambiguously assert a change of identity for any amino acid residue.\nThe number `N` is therefore `0`.",
