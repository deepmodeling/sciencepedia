            "problem": "Microsatellite Instability-High (MSI-H) is a genomic phenotype arising from deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and serves as a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint blockade in diverse solid tumors. In a stratified clinical registry comprising colorectal and endometrial tumors, assume that MSI-H status within each tumor type can be modeled as a Bernoulli random variable reflecting the underlying tumor-type-specific prevalence. Let the MSI-H prevalence in colorectal cancer be $p_{\\text{CRC}}=0.15$ and in endometrial cancer be $p_{\\text{Endometrial}}=0.30$. The registry contains $500$ colorectal tumors and $200$ endometrial tumors, each arising from its respective population with the given prevalence.\n\nUsing only foundational probability definitions for indicator random variables and the concept of expectation, compute the expected total number of MSI-H cases across the entire registry. Express your final answer as an integer count of cases. No rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected total number of MSI-H cases in a registry containing two distinct tumor cohorts: colorectal and endometrial. We are to use the concept of indicator random variables and the property of linearity of expectation.\n\nLet $T_{\\text{Total}}$ be the random variable representing the total number of MSI-H cases in the entire registry. This total is the sum of the cases from the colorectal cohort and the endometrial cohort.\nLet $T_{\\text{CRC}}$ be the total number of MSI-H cases among the colorectal tumors.\nLet $T_{\\text{Endometrial}}$ be the total number of MSI-H cases among the endometrial tumors.\n\nThus, we have the relation:\n$$T_{\\text{Total}} = T_{\\text{CRC}} + T_{\\text{Endometrial}}$$\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$E[T_{\\text{Total}}] = E[T_{\\text{CRC}} + T_{\\text{Endometrial}}] = E[T_{\\text{CRC}}] + E[T_{\\text{Endometrial}}]$$\n\nFirst, we compute the expected number of MSI-H cases in the colorectal cancer cohort, $E[T_{\\text{CRC}}]$. The cohort consists of $N_{\\text{CRC}} = 500$ tumors. For each tumor $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 500\\}$, we define an indicator random variable $X_i$:\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th colorectal tumor is MSI-H} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe problem states that the MSI-H status for a colorectal tumor follows a Bernoulli distribution with prevalence $p_{\\text{CRC}} = 0.15$. The probability that any given colorectal tumor is MSI-H is $P(X_i = 1) = p_{\\text{CRC}} = 0.15$.\nThe expectation of an indicator random variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, for each $i$:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i = 1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i = 0)) = P(X_i = 1) = p_{\\text{CRC}}$$\nThe total number of MSI-H cases in the colorectal cohort is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$T_{\\text{CRC}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\\text{CRC}}} X_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{500} X_i$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation, the expected number of MSI-H cases in this cohort is:\n$$E[T_{\\text{CRC}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{500} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{500} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{500} p_{\\text{CRC}} = N_{\\text{CRC}} \\times p_{\\text{CRC}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[T_{\\text{CRC}}] = 500 \\times 0.15 = 75$$\n\nNext, we perform the analogous calculation for the endometrial cancer cohort. This cohort consists of $N_{\\text{Endometrial}} = 200$ tumors. For each tumor $j \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 200\\}$, we define an indicator random variable $Y_j$:\n$$\nY_j = \n\\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if the } j\\text{-th endometrial tumor is MSI-H} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe prevalence for endometrial cancer is $p_{\\text{Endometrial}} = 0.30$. The expectation of each indicator variable is:\n$$E[Y_j] = P(Y_j = 1) = p_{\\text{Endometrial}} = 0.30$$\nThe total number of MSI-H cases in the endometrial cohort is:\n$$T_{\\text{Endometrial}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\text{Endometrial}}} Y_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{200} Y_j$$\nThe expected number of MSI-H cases in this cohort is:\n$$E[T_{\\text{Endometrial}}] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=1}^{200} Y_j\\right] = \\sum_{j=1}^{200} E[Y_j] = \\sum_{j=1}^{200} p_{\\text{Endometrial}} = N_{\\text{Endometrial}} \\times p_{\\text{Endometrial}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[T_{\\text{Endometrial}}] = 200 \\times 0.30 = 60$$\n\nFinally, we compute the expected total number of MSI-H cases across the entire registry by summing the expected values for each cohort:\n$$E[T_{\\text{Total}}] = E[T_{\\text{CRC}}] + E[T_{\\text{Endometrial}}] = 75 + 60 = 135$$\n\nThe expected total number of MSI-H cases in the registry is $135$.",

            "introduction": "In clinical diagnostics, it is not uncommon for different assays to yield seemingly contradictory results. This exercise presents a classic puzzle in oncology: a tumor that is functionally MSI-High but shows intact expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins by immunohistochemistry (IHC). By working through the potential molecular mechanisms, you will deepen your understanding of how genetic mutations can abolish protein function without affecting protein expression, a critical distinction for accurate diagnosis. ",
            "id": "4360285",
            "problem": "A colorectal adenocarcinoma is assessed by two orthogonal assays for microsatellite instability (MSI). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a standard panel of $5$ mononucleotide markers calls the tumor microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H), and a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay independently reports an MSI score above its validated threshold along with tumor mutational burden (TMB) of $45$ mutations per megabase. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for mismatch repair (MMR) proteins shows intact nuclear staining for MutS homolog $2$ (MSH2), MutS homolog $6$ (MSH6), MutL homolog $1$ (MLH1), and postmeiotic segregation increased $2$ (PMS2) in $>90\\%$ of tumor nuclei with appropriate internal controls.\n\nFrom first principles, recall that the Central Dogma of molecular biology states that DNA is transcribed to RNA and translated to protein, and that IHC relies on antibodies binding to specific protein epitopes to infer protein presence, not protein function. Also recall that deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair involves MutS complexes (e.g., MSH2/MSH6) recognizing mismatches and MutL complexes (e.g., MLH1/PMS2) coordinating excision and resynthesis, with endonuclease activity residing in PMS2. Microsatellite instability arises when replication slippage at repetitive tracts is not corrected by functional MMR, causing length variability detectable by PCR or NGS. \n\nWhich of the following mechanisms most plausibly reconcile MSI-H results with intact IHC in this tumor? Select all that apply.\n\nA. A pathogenic missense mutation in MSH6 that disrupts adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycling required for mismatch processing but preserves protein stability and the antibody-recognized epitope, yielding retained MSH6 staining despite functional MMR deficiency.\n\nB. MLH1 promoter hypermethylation driving transcriptional silencing of MLH1 and secondary degradation of PMS2, a process expected to abolish MLH1 and PMS2 IHC staining.\n\nC. A cryptic splice-site mutation in MSH6 that produces an in-frame exon skip deleting a critical functional domain but leaving the antibody’s epitope intact, resulting in a stable yet nonfunctional MSH6 detectable by IHC.\n\nD. A deletion in the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) $3^\\prime$ region causing MSH2 promoter methylation, which is expected to preserve MSH2 and MSH6 IHC staining while inducing MSI-H.\n\nE. An exonuclease-domain mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) causing an ultramutated state that is routinely called MSI-H by PCR and NGS, even when MMR is fully functional and IHC is intact.\n\nF. Two somatic missense mutations in PMS2 that abolish its endonuclease activity while maintaining MLH1/PMS2 heterodimerization and immunoreactive epitopes, leading to MSI-H with retained MLH1 and PMS2 staining.\n\nChoose all that apply.",
            "solution": "The central issue is the discordance between the functional assays (PCR and NGS showing an MSI-H/high TMB phenotype, indicative of a deficient mismatch repair system) and the protein expression assay (IHC showing intact expression of the four key MMR proteins: MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6). The fundamental principle to resolve this is that IHC detects the presence of a protein's specific epitope, but it does not provide information about the protein's functional integrity. A protein can be expressed, stable, and correctly localized to the nucleus, thus yielding an \"intact\" IHC result, yet be non-functional due to mutations that affect catalytic activity, substrate binding, or protein-protein interactions without disrupting the antibody-binding site or overall protein stability. The task is to identify which of the proposed mechanisms result in such a non-functional but structurally present protein.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. A pathogenic missense mutation in MSH6 that disrupts adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) cycling required for mismatch processing but preserves protein stability and the antibody-recognized epitope, yielding retained MSH6 staining despite functional MMR deficiency.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: A missense mutation changes a single amino acid. If this mutation occurs in a critical functional domain, such as the ATPase domain of MSH6, it can abolish the protein's function. The MSH2/MSH6 (MutS$\\alpha$) complex uses ATP binding and hydrolysis to translocate along DNA and signal for repair. Disrupting this activity renders the complex inert. If the mutation does not grossly alter the protein's conformation, it will likely remain stable, localize correctly, and retain the epitope recognized by the IHC antibody.\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: This mechanism perfectly explains the data. The non-functional MSH6 protein leads to MMR deficiency, causing the MSI-H phenotype and high TMB. The preserved protein stability and epitope lead to the \"intact\" MSH6 staining observed by IHC. Since MSH6 loss can be secondary to MSH2 loss, but not vice-versa, MSH2 staining would also be retained. MLH1 and PMS2 are unaffected.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. MLH1 promoter hypermethylation driving transcriptional silencing of MLH1 and secondary degradation of PMS2, a process expected to abolish MLH1 and PMS2 IHC staining.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: Promoter hypermethylation is an epigenetic modification that silences gene transcription. Silencing of the $MLH1$ gene would prevent the production of MLH1 protein. PMS2 is only stable when it forms a heterodimer with MLH1. In the absence of MLH1, PMS2 is degraded.\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: This mechanism would result in the *loss* of both MLH1 and PMS2 protein expression. Consequently, IHC would show a loss of nuclear staining for both MLH1 and PMS2. This directly contradicts the given information that IHC staining for all four proteins, including MLH1 and PMS2, is intact.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A cryptic splice-site mutation in MSH6 that produces an in-frame exon skip deleting a critical functional domain but leaving the antibody’s epitope intact, resulting in a stable yet nonfunctional MSH6 detectable by IHC.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: A splice-site mutation can cause an entire exon to be skipped during RNA processing. If the number of nucleotides in the skipped exon is a multiple of $3$, the downstream reading frame is preserved (an \"in-frame\" skip). This produces a slightly shorter protein that is missing the amino acids coded by that exon. If this exon contained a critical functional domain, the resulting protein would be non-functional. If the protein remains stable and the deleted region does not contain the IHC antibody epitope, it would be detected as \"intact\" by IHC.\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: Similar to option A, this is a valid mechanism for creating a non-functional but present protein. It would lead to MMR deficiency (MSI-H, high TMB) while explaining the retained MSH6 staining.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**D. A deletion in the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) $3^\\prime$ region causing MSH2 promoter methylation, which is expected to preserve MSH2 and MSH6 IHC staining while inducing MSI-H.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: Constitutional deletions of the $3^\\prime$ end of the $EPCAM$ gene, which lies upstream of $MSH2$, are a known cause of Lynch syndrome. This deletion leads to epigenetic silencing of the adjacent $MSH2$ promoter via hypermethylation. This silencing prevents transcription and subsequent translation of MSH2 protein. Similar to the MLH1/PMS2 pair, MSH6 is unstable without its partner MSH2 and is degraded.\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: This mechanism results in the *loss* of both MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression, which would be detected as absent staining on IHC. The option's claim that this is \"expected to preserve MSH2 and MSH6 IHC staining\" is factually incorrect. Therefore, this option contradicts the given IHC data.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. An exonuclease-domain mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) causing an ultramutated state that is routinely called MSI-H by PCR and NGS, even when MMR is fully functional and IHC is intact.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: Pathogenic mutations in the exonuclease (proofreading) domain of DNA polymerase epsilon ($POLE$) cause a distinct hypermutator phenotype. These tumors accumulate a very high number of single nucleotide variants, leading to an \"ultramutated\" state (TMB often $>100$ mut/Mb). However, the MMR system in these tumors is typically functional. Therefore, they do not exhibit instability in microsatellite repeat tracts. They are classified as microsatellite stable (MSS).\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: The statement that this state is \"routinely called MSI-H by PCR and NGS\" is false. Standard PCR-based MSI testing (e.g., the Bethesda panel) specifically detects length polymorphisms in microsatellites and would classify a $POLE$-mutant tumor as MSS. While some NGS algorithms might be confounded, dedicated MSI detection tools are designed to distinguish the indel-rich pattern of MSI from the substitution-rich pattern of $POLE$ mutations. The MSI-H call by a standard PCR panel, as given in the problem, is a definitive finding that is not characteristic of a $POLE$-mutant tumor. The MMR system would be functional and IHC intact, but the MSI-H finding would not be explained.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Two somatic missense mutations in PMS2 that abolish its endonuclease activity while maintaining MLH1/PMS2 heterodimerization and immunoreactive epitopes, leading to MSI-H with retained MLH1 and PMS2 staining.**\n-   **Mechanism Analysis**: This describes a scenario analogous to option A, but involving PMS2. Bi-allelic (one on each copy of the gene) missense mutations could inactivate the protein. The endonuclease activity of PMS2 is essential for nicking the newly synthesized strand to allow for excision of the mismatched segment. Abolishing this function renders the entire MMR pathway non-functional. If the mutations are missense and do not affect protein stability, dimerization with MLH1, or the antibody epitope, the MLH1/PMS2 complex will form and localize to the nucleus, yielding intact IHC staining for both proteins.\n-   **Consistency with Givens**: This mechanism explains the functional deficiency (MSI-H, high TMB) while being consistent with the observation of intact MLH1 and PMS2 staining by IHC. The MSH2 and MSH6 proteins would also be unaffected. This is a plausible, albeit specific, explanation for the observed results.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.",
