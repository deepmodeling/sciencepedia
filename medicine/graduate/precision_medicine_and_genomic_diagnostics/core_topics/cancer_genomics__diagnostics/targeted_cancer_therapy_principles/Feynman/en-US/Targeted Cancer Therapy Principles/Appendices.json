            "introduction": "The efficacy of a targeted therapy begins with the fundamental interaction between a drug and its protein target. This practice focuses on quantifying this interaction by exploring two critical pharmacokinetic parameters: the equilibrium dissociation constant ($K_{d}$), which measures binding affinity, and the dissociation half-life ($t_{1/2}$), which reflects drug-target residence time. By deriving these values from fundamental rate constants, you will develop a deeper appreciation for how both high affinity and prolonged engagement contribute to a drug's overall effectiveness .",

            "problem": "A small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor is designed to selectively bind a mutant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR; Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor) implicated in lung adenocarcinoma. Binding is described by the reversible reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons C$ under the law of mass action, where $R$ is free receptor, $L$ is free ligand (drug), and $C$ is the receptor–ligand complex. Experiments at physiological temperature report an association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}} = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$ and a dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action and the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for $R + L \\rightleftharpoons C$, and assuming a first-order dissociation process for $C \\to R + L$ after rapid dilution of $L$, derive expressions for the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{d}$ and the dissociation half-life $t_{1/2}$ in terms of $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$.

            "solution": "The binding of the ligand ($L$) to the receptor ($R$) to form a complex ($C$) is described by the reversible reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons C$. According to the law of mass action, the rate of the forward reaction (association) is proportional to the concentrations of the free reactants, and the rate of the reverse reaction (dissociation) is proportional to the concentration of the complex. The rate equations are:\nRate of association, $v_f = k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L]$\nRate of dissociation, $v_r = k_{\\text{off}} [C]$\n\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[C]$ are the molar concentrations of the free receptor, free ligand, and receptor-ligand complex, respectively. The constants $k_{\\text{on}}$ and $k_{\\text{off}}$ are the association and dissociation rate constants.\n\nFirst, we derive an expression for the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the net rate of formation of the complex is zero, meaning the rate of association equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$v_f = v_r$$\n$$k_{\\text{on}} [R] [L] = k_{\\text{off}} [C]$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the ratio of concentrations at equilibrium:\n$$K_d \\equiv \\frac{[R]_{\\text{eq}}[L]_{\\text{eq}}}{[C]_{\\text{eq}}}$$\nBy rearranging the rate equality, we can express $K_d$ in terms of the rate constants:\n$$K_d = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$$\n\nNext, we derive an expression for the dissociation half-life, $t_{1/2}$. The problem specifies considering a first-order dissociation process after rapid dilution of the free ligand $L$. This dilution reduces $[L]$ to negligible levels, thereby preventing the re-association reaction ($R+L \\to C$). The change in the complex concentration $[C]$ over time $t$ is then governed solely by the dissociation process:\n$$\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = -k_{\\text{off}}[C]$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating:\n$$\\int_{[C]_0}^{[C](t)} \\frac{d[C]}{[C]} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{\\text{off}} dt$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[C](t)}{[C]_0}\\right) = -k_{\\text{off}} t$$\n$$[C](t) = [C]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t)$$\nwhere $[C]_0$ is the concentration of the complex at time $t=0$. The half-life, $t_{1/2}$, is defined as the time required for the concentration of the complex to decrease to half of its initial value, i.e., $[C](t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}[C]_0$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2}[C]_0 = [C]_0 \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t_{1/2})$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k_{\\text{off}} t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k_{\\text{off}} t_{1/2}$$\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k_{\\text{off}} t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for $t_{1/2}$, we obtain:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{\\text{off}}}$$\n\nNow we compute the binding efficacy score, $S$, defined as:\n$$S \\equiv -\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{1\\,\\mathrm{M}}\\right) + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{t_{1/2}}{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$$\nWe substitute the derived expressions for $K_d$ and $t_{1/2}$:\n$$S = -\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{k_{\\text{off}}/k_{\\text{on}}}{1\\,\\mathrm{M}}\\right) + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)/k_{\\text{off}}}{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$k_{\\text{on}} = 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$\n$k_{\\text{off}} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values for $K_d$ and $t_{1/2}$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 1000 \\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nNow we substitute these values into the expression for $S$. The units are handled by the normalization constants $1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ and $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$, making the arguments of the logarithms dimensionless.\n$$S = -\\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{1\\,\\mathrm{M}}\\right) + \\log_{10}\\!\\left(\\frac{1000 \\ln(2)\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}\\right)$$\n$$S = -\\log_{10}(10^{-9}) + \\log_{10}(1000 \\ln(2))$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\log(a^b) = b\\log(a)$ and $\\log(xy) = \\log(x) + \\log(y)$:\n$$S = -(-9) + \\log_{10}(10^3) + \\log_{10}(\\ln(2))$$\n$$S = 9 + 3 + \\log_{10}(\\ln(2))$$\n$$S = 12 + \\log_{10}(\\ln(2))$$\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value:\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$\n$\\log_{10}(\\ln(2)) \\approx \\log_{10}(0.693147) \\approx -0.159176$\n$$S \\approx 12 - 0.159176 = 11.840824$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $S = 11.84$.",

            "introduction": "While strong initial binding is crucial, the clinical success of targeted therapies is often challenged by the evolution of drug resistance. This exercise models one of the most common mechanisms of resistance: an on-target mutation that weakens the drug's binding affinity, thereby increasing the dissociation constant ($K_{d}$). By applying the principles of receptor occupancy theory, you will calculate the direct impact of such a mutation on target engagement and determine the theoretical dose adjustment required to overcome it, providing a quantitative framework for understanding clinical resistance .",

The binding reaction follows mass-action kinetics at equilibrium, with free drug concentration denoted by $C$, free receptor concentration by $[R]$, ligand–receptor complex concentration by $[RL]$, association rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}$, dissociation rate constant $k_{\\text{off}}$, and dissociation constant $K_{d}$ defined by the equilibrium relation $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$ and $K_{d} = \\frac{[R]C}{[RL]}$. The pharmacologic effect is assumed to be proportional to the occupancy of the target by the inhibitor, defined as the fraction of total target bound. \n\nAn emergent on-target resistance mutation increases the dissociation constant ten-fold, from $K_{d}$ to $10K_{d}$, without altering binding stoichiometry, target abundance, drug clearance, protein turnover, or the linearity of pharmacokinetics.

            "solution": "First, we derive the occupancy as a function of $C$ and $K_{d}$. Occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound by the ligand. The total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the free receptor concentration, $[R]$, and the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex, $[RL]$.\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL]$$\nThe occupancy is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nFrom the equilibrium expression $K_{d} = \\frac{[R]C}{[RL]}$, we can solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$[R] = \\frac{K_{d}[RL]}{C}$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the occupancy equation:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\frac{K_{d}[RL]}{C} + [RL]}$$\nAssuming a non-zero drug concentration and binding, $[RL]$ is non-zero and can be factored out from the denominator:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL]\\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1\\right)}$$\nCanceling the $[RL]$ term yields the occupancy as a function of the free drug concentration $C$ and the dissociation constant $K_{d}$:\n$$\\theta(C, K_{d}) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{C} + 1} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nThis is the standard Hill-Langmuir isotherm for single-site binding.\n\nNext, we compute the change in occupancy. The wild-type (pre-mutation) occupancy, $\\theta_{\\text{WT}}$, is:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{WT}} = \\frac{C}{C + K_{d}}$$\nThe resistant mutant has a dissociation constant of $10K_{d}$.

This final practice bridges pharmacology with genomics by modeling the variant allele fraction (VAF) — a key metric from tumor sequencing.

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory for precision oncology evaluates a targeted therapy candidate mutation in a tumor sample using deep sequencing. The measured quantity of interest is the variant allele fraction (VAF), defined by the probability that a randomly sampled allele at the locus is the mutant allele, under the assumption that sequencing reads are unbiased and alleles are sampled proportionally to copy number.\n\nThe tumor purity is the fraction of tumor cells in the sequenced specimen, denoted by $\\pi$. The remaining fraction $1-\\pi$ are non-tumor (normal) cells. Each tumor cell in the region of interest has a total copy number $C_{t}$, and each normal cell has a total copy number $C_{n}$, with $C_{n}=2$ for a diploid genome. The mutation is clonal in the tumor compartment, meaning every tumor cell harbors the mutation on exactly $m$ of its $C_{t}$ copies; normal cells carry no mutant copies. Assume perfect mixing and that the number of sequenced alleles is large enough for the law of large numbers to apply.\n\nStarting from these definitions and first principles of counting in mixtures, derive a closed-form expression for the expected VAF in terms of $\\pi$, $C_{t}$, $C_{n}$, and $m$. Then, evaluate this expression for the following two scenarios relevant to targeted cancer therapy decision-making:\n\n1.

For the numerical evaluations, express each VAF as a decimal and round to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The variant allele fraction, `VAF`, is defined as the total number of mutant alleles divided by the total number of alleles (mutant and wild-type) at a specific locus within the entire cell population being sequenced. We can equate the `VAF` with its expected value based on the cellular composition of the sample.\n\nLet us consider a representative collection of cells from the specimen. A fraction `\\pi` of these cells are tumor cells, and the remaining fraction, `1-\\pi`, are normal cells.\n\nThe number of mutant alleles is contributed exclusively by the tumor cells. In a population of tumor cells, each cell has `m` mutant alleles. Therefore, the relative number of mutant alleles from the tumor compartment is `\\pi \\times m`.\n\nThe total number of alleles at the locus is the sum of alleles from both the tumor and normal cell compartments.\nThe relative number of alleles from the tumor compartment is `\\pi \\times C_t`.\nThe relative number of alleles from the normal compartment is `(1-\\pi) \\times C_n`.\n\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is proportional to `\\pi C_t + (1-\\pi) C_n`.\n\nThe expected `VAF` is the ratio of the total number of mutant alleles to the total number of all alleles. We can thus write the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\text{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of mutant alleles}}{\\text{Total number of alleles}} = \\frac{\\pi m}{\\pi C_t + (1-\\pi) C_n}\n$$\nThis equation provides the theoretical `VAF` as a function of tumor purity (`\\pi`), mutant allele copy number (`m`), and the total copy numbers in the tumor (`C_t`) and normal (`C_n`) cell populations.\n\nQualitatively, this expression reveals how copy number variations affect the expected `VAF`.\nIf a copy number gain occurs in the tumor such that the mutant allele is not duplicated, `C_t` increases while `m` remains constant. This increases the denominator while the numerator remains unchanged, leading to a decrease in the `VAF`. This is \"allelic dilution\" by newly gained wild-type copies.\n\nConversely, if a copy number amplification duplicates the mutant allele, both `m` and `C_t` increase. The increase in `m` directly increases the numerator, which tends to raise the `VAF`, often having a dominant effect. For a clonal mutation, the `VAF` can be amplified, potentially exceeding the canonical `0.5` value expected for a heterozygous mutation in a pure diploid sample.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression for the two specific scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1:** Heterozygous clonal SNV in a diploid tumor.\nThe given parameters are: `\\pi = 0.6`, `C_t = 2`, `m = 1`, `C_n = 2`.\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_1 = \\frac{(0.6)(1)}{(0.6)(2) + (1-0.6)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.2 + (0.4)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.2 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.6}{2.0} = 0.3\n$$\nExpressed to four significant figures, the `VAF` is `0.3000`.\n\n**Scenario 2:** The same SNV with a single-copy amplification in the tumor.\nThe given parameters are: `\\pi = 0.6`, `C_t = 3`, `m = 1`, `C_n = 2`.\nHere, the copy number gain did not duplicate the mutant allele.\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_2 = \\frac{(0.6)(1)}{(0.6)(3) + (1-0.6)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.8 + (0.4)(2)} = \\frac{0.6}{1.8 + 0.8} = \\frac{0.6}{2.6}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{VAF}_2 = \\frac{6}{26} = \\frac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2307692...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the `VAF` is `0.2308`.
