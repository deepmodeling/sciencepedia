It is scientifically grounded in the principles of cancer immunology and genomics, it is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and it is objective. Therefore, a formal derivation and solution can be provided.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected number of candidate neoepitopes. Let this quantity be denoted by $E[\\mathcal{N}]$. A candidate neoepitope is defined as arising from a peptide with a predicted dissociation constant $K_D < 500\\,\\text{nM}$ for a relevant MHC allele.\n\nThe solution will be derived from the fundamental bases provided.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations in the tumor. The problem defines Tumor Mutational Burden ($T_{MB}$) as the number of nonsynonymous somatic mutations per megabase ($\\text{Mb}$) of coding DNA. It provides the following values:\n- The measured Tumor Mutational Burden, $T_{MB} = 10\\,\\text{mut}/\\text{Mb}$.\n- The exome coding span, $S_{exome} = 30\\,\\text{Mb}$.\n\nThe total number of nonsynonymous mutations, $N_{mut}$, is the product of the mutation density and the total size of the region surveyed:\n$$N_{mut} = T_{MB} \\times S_{exome}$$\n\nSecond, we must determine the expected number of candidate neoepitopes arising from this pool of mutations. The problem states that each nonsynonymous mutation can be treated as an independent trial. The Central Dogma basis confirms that such mutations can alter protein sequences, potentially creating new peptide ligands (neoepitopes).\n\nThe probability that a single, randomly chosen nonsynonymous mutation results in a candidate neoepitope is given. Let this probability be $p_{neo}$. The problem states that a fraction $0.01$ of nonsynonymous mutations produce peptides meeting the affinity threshold. Therefore:\n$$p_{neo} = 0.01$$\n\nThe total number of candidate neoepitopes, $\\mathcal{N}$, is the sum of the outcomes of $N_{mut}$ independent Bernoulli trials, where each trial $i$ has a probability of success $p_{neo}$.\nLet $X_i$ be a random variable for the $i$-th mutation, where $X_i = 1$ if it generates a candidate neoepitope and $X_i = 0$ otherwise. The total number of neoepitopes is $\\mathcal{N} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i$.\n\nThe \"basic probability notion\" provided states that the expected number of events is the sum of event probabilities. This is the principle of linearity of expectation. Applying this principle:\n$$E[\\mathcal{N}] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} E[X_i]$$\n\nFor each individual trial $i$, the expectation of the Bernoulli random variable $X_i$ is its probability of success:\n$$E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i = 0) = P(X_i=1) = p_{neo}$$\n\nSince each trial is identical, the sum becomes:\n$$E[\\mathcal{N}] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_{mut}} p_{neo} = N_{mut} \\times p_{neo}$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{mut}$, we arrive at the complete symbolic solution:\n$$E[\\mathcal{N}] = (T_{MB} \\times S_{exome}) \\times p_{neo}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $T_{MB} = 10$\n- $S_{exome} = 30$\n- $p_{neo} = 0.01$\n\nFirst, we compute the total number of nonsynonymous mutations, $N_{mut}$:\n$$N_{mut} = 10 \\, \\times \\, 30 = 300$$\n\nNext, we compute the expected number of candidate neoepitopes, $E[\\mathcal{N}]$:\n$$E[\\mathcal{N}] = 300 \\, \\times \\, 0.01 = 3$$\n\nThe expected number of candidate neoepitopes for the given parameters is $3$.

            "introduction": "While a high neoantigen load is promising, not all neoantigens are equally valuable as therapeutic targets. For an immunotherapy to be curative, it must ideally target antigens present in every single cancer cell, thereby preventing the escape of resistant subclones. This practice introduces the critical concept of tumor heterogeneity and teaches you how to infer the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF)—the proportion of cancer cells harboring a mutation—from standard bulk sequencing data like the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), tumor purity, and copy number . Mastering this allows you to prioritize clonal neoantigens as the most robust targets for therapy.",

            "problem": "A central problem in cancer immunotherapy is prioritizing neoantigen candidates that are present in all cancer cells (clonal) rather than only subclones. In bulk whole-exome sequencing, the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the variant. In a mixed sample of cancer and normal cells, the observed VAF depends on tumor purity, locus-specific tumor copy number, and the multiplicity of the mutated allele. The Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF) is defined as the fraction of cancer cells harboring the mutation. Assume a standard mixture model in which normal cells are diploid with total copy number $2$, there is no allelic bias, and sequencing depth is sufficiently high that sampling noise can be neglected. Also assume at each locus there is no subclonal copy-number heterogeneity and the mutated-allele multiplicity is known from phasing and timing with respect to copy-number changes.\n\nA patient tumor sample has purity $p=0.7$. Five nonsynonymous somatic mutations $M_1,\\dots,M_5$ are observed, each predicted to generate a high-affinity Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class I neoantigen. For each mutation $M_i$, you are given the measured VAF, the tumor total copy number $C_i$, and the mutated-allele multiplicity $m_i$ (the number of mutated genomic copies per cancer cell among those cancer cells that carry the mutation):\n\n- $M_1$: $\\text{VAF}=0.28$, $C_1=2$, $m_1=1$ (copy-neutral diploid).\n- $M_2$: $\\text{VAF}=0.65$, $C_2=2$, $m_2=2$ (copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity with the mutation on the retained allele before loss of heterozygosity).\n- $M_3$: $\\text{VAF}=0.23$, $C_3=3$, $m_3=1$ (single-copy mutation on a trisomic segment).\n- $M_4$: $\\text{VAF}=0.50$, $C_4=1$, $m_4=1$ (hemizygous deletion).\n- $M_5$: $\\text{VAF}=0.34$, $C_5=2$, $m_5=1$ (copy-neutral diploid).\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of VAF in a tumor-normal mixture and the definition of CCF, derive the expression relating CCF to VAF, $p$, $C_i$, and $m_i$, compute the CCF for each $M_i$, and then classify which neoantigens are clonal using the threshold criterion $CCF>0.9$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of cancer genomics, well-posed with a unique solvable outcome, and all necessary data and definitions are provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive the general relationship between the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF), the observed Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), tumor purity ($p$), locus-specific tumor total copy number ($C$), and mutated-allele multiplicity ($m$).\n\nThe VAF is the ratio of the number of sequencing reads carrying the mutated allele to the total number of sequencing reads covering that specific genomic locus. In a mixed sample of tumor and normal cells, we can model the expected VAF by considering the contributions from each cell population. We assume that the number of reads generated from a locus in a cell population is proportional to the fraction of that population in the sample and the total copy number of the locus in that population.\n\nLet $N_m$ be the expected contribution of mutated alleles to the read pool and $N_{Total}$ be the expected contribution of all alleles (mutated and wild-type) at that locus. The VAF is then given by:\n$$ VAF = \\frac{N_m}{N_{Total}} $$\n\nThe numerator, $N_m$, represents the reads from the mutated allele. The mutation exists only in the cancer cells. The fraction of cancer cells in the sample is the purity, $p$. Among these cancer cells, only a fraction, CCF, actually harbor the mutation. The number of copies of the mutated allele in these specific cancer cells is the multiplicity, $m$. Therefore, the contribution of mutated alleles is proportional to the product of these factors:\n$$ N_m \\propto p \\cdot CCF \\cdot m $$\n\nThe denominator, $N_{Total}$, represents reads from all alleles at the locus, originating from both tumor and normal cells.\nThe contribution from the entire tumor cell population (fraction $p$) is proportional to $p \\cdot C$, where $C$ is the total copy number of the locus in tumor cells.\nThe contribution from the normal cell population (fraction $1-p$) is proportional to $(1-p) \\cdot n_N$, where $n_N$ is the total copy number in normal cells. The problem states that normal cells are diploid, so $n_N = 2$.\nThus, the total contribution is:\n$$ N_{Total} \\propto p \\cdot C + (1-p) \\cdot 2 $$\n\nCombining these, we get the expression for VAF:\n$$ VAF_i = \\frac{p \\cdot CCF_i \\cdot m_i}{p \\cdot C_i + (1-p) \\cdot 2} $$\nwhere the index $i$ corresponds to a specific mutation $M_i$.\n\nTo find the $CCF_i$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$ CCF_i = \\frac{VAF_i \\cdot (p \\cdot C_i + 2(1-p))}{p \\cdot m_i} $$\nThis is the general formula we will use for our calculations.\n\nThe problem provides the purity $p=0.7$.

A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the receptor occupancy fraction, $f$, and calculate its value. The occupancy fraction is defined as the ratio of the concentration of the-ligand bound HLA complex to the total concentration of HLA molecules:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H]_{T}}$$\n\nThe total HLA concentration, $[H]_{T}$, is the sum of the free HLA concentration, $[H]$, and the bound HLA concentration, $[HL]$:\n\n$$[H]_{T} = [H] + [HL]$$\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $f$ gives:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{[H] + [HL]}$$\n\nTo express $f$ in terms of the measurable or known quantities $[L]$ and $K_{D}$, we must eliminate $[H]$ and $[HL]$ from the ratio. We can use the definition of the dissociation constant, $K_{D}$:\n\n$$K_{D} = \\frac{[H][L]}{[HL]}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentration of free HLA, $[H]$, in terms of the other species:\n\n$$[H] = K_{D} \\frac{[HL]}{[L]}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[H]$ back into the equation for $f$:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{ \\left( K_{D} \\frac{[HL]}{[L]} \\right) + [HL] }$$\n\nAssuming the peptide concentration $[L]$ is non-zero, the concentration of the complex $[HL]$ will also be non-zero. We can therefore factor $[HL]$ from the denominator and cancel it with the numerator:\n\n$$f = \\frac{[HL]}{ [HL] \\left( \\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1 \\right) } = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1}$$\n\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n\n$$f = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{ \\left( \\frac{K_{D}}{[L]} + 1 \\right) \\cdot [L] } = \\frac{[L]}{K_{D} + [L]}$$\n\nThis expression, known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for a $1:1$ binding site model, gives the receptor occupancy fraction $f$ as a function of free ligand concentration $[L]$ and the dissociation constant $K_{D}$.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n-   Peptide concentration, which under the stated approximation is the free peptide concentration: $[L] = 100\\,\\text{nM}$.\n-   Dissociation constant: $K_{D} = 50\\,\\text{nM}$.\n\nWe can now compute the numerical value of $f$ by substituting these values into the derived equation. The units of concentration ($\\text{nM}$) will cancel, yielding a dimensionless fraction, as expected.\n\n$$f = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{50\\,\\text{nM} + 100\\,\\text{nM}} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{nM}}{150\\,\\text{nM}}$$\n\n$$f = \\frac{100}{150}$$\n\nReducing the fraction to its simplest form:\n\n$$f = \\frac{10}{15} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n\nThus, the predicted receptor occupancy fraction for the given neoantigen peptide is $\\frac{2}{3}$.
