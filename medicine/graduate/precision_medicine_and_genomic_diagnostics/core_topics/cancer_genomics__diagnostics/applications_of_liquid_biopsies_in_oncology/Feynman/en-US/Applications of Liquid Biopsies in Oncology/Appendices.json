The provided values for plasma volume, cfDNA concentration, and extraction efficiency are realistic for a clinical laboratory setting.\n\nThe objective is to determine the recovered mass of cfDNA, denoted as $m_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, from the given parameters. The solution requires a two-step calculation based on the provided definitions.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total mass of cfDNA, $m$, present in the initial plasma sample.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. The problem consists of two parts: first, a derivation and explanation of the mass per haploid genome equivalent from first principles, and second, a calculation based on this value.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Mass per Haploid Genome Equivalent\n\nThe problem requires deriving the approximate mass of a single haploid human genome using fundamental constants. Let $m_{genome}$ be the mass of one haploid genome. This mass can be calculated from the total number of base pairs in the genome, the average molar mass of a single base pair, and Avogadro's constant, which relates molar mass to the mass of a single entity.\n\nThe given quantities are:\n- The size of the human haploid genome, $S \\approx 3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ base pairs (bp).\n- The average molar mass per base pair, $M_{bp} \\approx 660 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$.\n- Avogadro’s constant, $N_{A} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total molar mass of one haploid genome, $M_{genome}$. This is the product of the number of base pairs and the molar mass per base pair. The unit 'bp' can be treated as a counting unit.\n$$M_{genome} = S \\times M_{bp}$$\n$$M_{genome} \\approx (3.2 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (660 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}) = 2.112 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$$\nThis is the mass of one mole of haploid genomes. To find the mass of a single haploid genome, $m_{genome}$, we must divide the molar mass by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$.\n$$m_{genome} = \\frac{M_{genome}}{N_{A}} = \\frac{S \\times M_{bp}}{N_{A}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m_{genome} \\approx \\frac{2.112 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ g mol}^{-1}}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}} \\approx 3.5069 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ g}$$\nThe problem asks for this mass in picograms ($pg$), where $1 \\text{ pg} = 10^{-12} \\text{ g}$.\n$$m_{genome} \\approx 3.51 \\text{ pg}$$\nThis calculation demonstrates that the mass of a haploid human genome is on the order of picograms.\n\nThe discrepancy between our calculated value of approximately $3.5 \\text{ pg}$ and the conventional value of $3.3 \\text{ pg}$ arises from the approximate nature of the input parameters. The size of the human genome and the average molar mass of a base pair are not fixed, exact numbers.\n1.  **Genome Size**: The value of $3.2 \\times 10^{9}$ bp is an approximation. The actual size of the human reference genome varies slightly with each assembly (e.g., GRCh37 vs. GRCh38) and is often cited as closer to $3.1 \\times 10^{9}$ bp when considering only the primary assembly sequences.\n2.  **Molar Mass**: The value of $660 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$ is a high-end approximation for the molar mass of a double-stranded base pair. The molar mass of an A-T pair is slightly different from a G-C pair, and the overall average depends on the genome's GC-content. A more commonly used average is approximately $650 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$.\n\nIf we recalculate using these slightly adjusted, but equally justifiable, parameters ($S \\approx 3.1 \\times 10^{9}$ bp and $M_{bp} \\approx 650 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$):\n$$m_{genome} = \\frac{(3.1 \\times 10^{9}) \\times (650 \\text{ g mol}^{-1})}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23} \\text{ mol}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{2.015 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ g}}{6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}} \\approx 3.346 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ g}$$\nThis corresponds to approximately $3.3 \\text{ pg}$. Therefore, the conventional value of $3.3 \\text{ pg}$ per haploid genome equivalent is a standardized and convenient figure that arises from reasonable estimates of the genome's physical properties. It provides a consistent basis for comparing cfDNA quantities across different experiments and laboratories.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of Haploid Genome Equivalents\n\nThe problem asks to determine the number of haploid genome equivalents in an extracted cfDNA mass of $80 \\text{ ng}$.\nLet the total mass of the cfDNA sample be $M_{sample} = 80 \\text{ ng}$.\nThe conventional conversion factor for the mass of one haploid genome equivalent is $m_{GE} = 3.3 \\text{ pg}$.\n\nTo find the number of haploid genome equivalents, $N_{GE}$, we must divide the total sample mass by the mass per genome equivalent. It is essential to first ensure the units are consistent. We will convert nanograms ($ng$) to picograms ($pg$).\nThe relationship is $1 \\text{ ng} = 1000 \\text{ pg} = 1 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ pg}$.\nTherefore, the sample mass in picograms is:\n$$M_{sample} = 80 \\text{ ng} \\times \\frac{1000 \\text{ pg}}{1 \\text{ ng}} = 80000 \\text{ pg} = 8 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ pg}$$\nNow, we can calculate the number of genome equivalents:\n$$N_{GE} = \\frac{M_{sample}}{m_{GE}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ pg}}{3.3 \\text{ pg}}$$\n$$N_{GE} \\approx 24242.4242...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a dimensionless number rounded to $3$ significant figures.\nRounding the result gives:\n$$N_{GE} \\approx 24200$$\nIn scientific notation, this is $2.42 \\times 10^{4}$. This number is dimensionless, as it represents a count of genome equivalents.",

            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Clinical sensitivity: $0.85$\n- Clinical specificity: $0.99$\n- Pretest probability of the target mutation (prevalence): $0.05$\n- The task is to derive the expression for the posterior probability that a patient with a positive test result truly has the mutation, which is the positive predictive value, $PPV = \\mathbb{P}(\\text{mutation} \\mid \\text{test positive})$.\n- The foundational rule to be used is Bayes' theorem.\n- The final numerical answer must be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of probability theory (Bayes' theorem) and its application in medical diagnostics (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, predictive values). These concepts are fundamental to evidence-based medicine and clinical laboratory science. The provided numerical values for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence are realistic for ctDNA-based liquid biopsy assays in an oncology setting.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The context and parameters are scientifically plausible and reflect real-world clinical scenarios.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $M$: The event that the patient truly harbors the mutation.\n- $M^c$: The event that the patient does not harbor the mutation (the complement of $M$).\n- $T^+$: The event that the test result is positive.\n- $T^-$: The event that the test result is negative.\n\nThe givens can be formally expressed in the language of conditional probability:\n- The pretest probability, or prevalence, is $\\mathbb{P}(M) = 0.05$.\n- The probability of not having the mutation is therefore $\\mathbb{P}(M^c) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(M) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95$.\n- The clinical sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the mutation is present. This is the true positive rate: $\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) = 0.85$.\n- The clinical specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the mutation is absent. This is the true negative rate: $\\mathbb{P}(T^- \\mid M^c) = 0.99$.\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result given that the mutation is absent. This is the false positive rate ($FPR$):\n$$ FPR = \\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M^c) = 1 - \\mathbb{P}(T^- \\mid M^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01 $$\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the positive predictive value ($PPV$), which is the posterior probability that the patient has the mutation given a positive test result, $\\mathbb{P}(M \\mid T^+)$.\n\nWe start with Bayes' theorem, which states:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(M \\mid T^+) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) \\mathbb{P}(M)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $\\mathbb{P}(T^+)$, is the marginal probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability by conditioning on whether the mutation is present ($M$) or absent ($M^c$):\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T^+) = \\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) \\mathbb{P}(M) + \\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M^c) \\mathbb{P}(M^c) $$\nThe first term, $\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) \\mathbb{P}(M)$, represents the probability of a true positive result in the population. The second term, $\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M^c) \\mathbb{P}(M^c)$, represents the probability of a false positive result in the population.\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of the denominator back into Bayes' theorem yields the full expression for the $PPV$:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(M \\mid T^+) = \\frac{\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) \\mathbb{P}(M)}{\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M) \\mathbb{P}(M) + \\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M^c) \\mathbb{P}(M^c)} $$\nThis is the derived expression. We can express this using the standard diagnostic terminology:\nLet $Se$ be the sensitivity, $\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M)$.\nLet $Sp$ be the specificity, $\\mathbb{P}(T^- \\mid M^c)$.\nLet $Prev$ be the prevalence, $\\mathbb{P}(M)$.\nThen $1 - Sp$ is the false positive rate, $\\mathbb{P}(T^+ \\mid M^c)$, and $1 - Prev$ is $\\mathbb{P}(M^c)$.\nThe expression becomes:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{Se \\times Prev}{(Se \\times Prev) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - Prev))} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical parameters:\n- $Se = 0.85$\n- $Sp = 0.99$\n- $Prev = 0.05$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the expression:\n- The numerator is the probability of a true positive: $Se \\times Prev = 0.85 \\times 0.05 = 0.0425$.\n- The second term in the denominator is the probability of a false positive: $(1 - Sp) \\times (1 - Prev) = (1 - 0.99) \\times (1 - 0.05) = 0.01 \\times 0.95 = 0.0095$.\n\nNow, substitute these values into the $PPV$ formula:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0425 + 0.0095} $$\n$$ PPV = \\frac{0.0425}{0.0520} $$\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.81730769... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ PPV \\approx 0.8173 $$\nThis result signifies that for a patient from this population with a positive test result, there is an $81.73\\%$ probability that they truly have the mutation. This highlights the crucial impact of prevalence; even with high specificity ($99\\%$), the relatively low prevalence ($5\\%$) constrains the positive predictive value.",
