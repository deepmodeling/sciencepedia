            "problem": "In a bulk sequencing experiment for precision oncology, consider a solid tumor sample that is a mixture of tumor and normal cells. The tumor arose by Knudson’s two-hit mechanism at the Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) locus: the first hit is a clonal truncating point mutation, and the second hit is clonal copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), meaning one parental allele is lost and the remaining allele is duplicated without net change in total copy number. Assume that after these two hits, every tumor cell has two copies at the RB1 locus and both copies carry the truncating mutation. Normal cells remain diploid at RB1 with two wild-type copies. Let the tumor purity be $p$, defined as the fraction (in $[0,1]$) of DNA in the sample originating from tumor cells. Assume unbiased sequencing such that each allele copy in the mixture is equally likely to be sequenced, and there is no allelic bias or mapping bias. Using only first principles—namely, that the variant allele fraction (VAF) is the fraction of sequenced allele copies that carry the variant—derive the expected VAF for the truncating RB1 mutation as a function of $p$ under these assumptions.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form function of $p$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing a clear basis for a formal derivation.\n\nThe goal is to derive the expected Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) of a truncating mutation at the Retinoblastoma 1 ($RB1$) locus as a function of tumor purity, $p$. The VAF is defined as the ratio of the number of allele copies carrying the variant to the total number of allele copies at that specific genomic locus within the sequenced sample.\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{\\text{Number of variant allele copies}}{\\text{Total number of allele copies}} $$\nLet $p$ be the tumor purity, which is the fraction of DNA in the sample originating from tumor cells. Consequently, the fraction of DNA originating from normal cells is $1-p$.\n\nWe are given the following information about the state of the $RB1$ locus in the two cell populations:\n1.  **Normal Cells**: These cells are diploid and contain two wild-type copies of the $RB1$ gene. Let's denote the wild-type allele as $W$. The genotype of a normal cell is therefore $W/W$. The total copy number at this locus is $2$.\n2.  **Tumor Cells**: These cells have undergone two clonal events. The first was a point mutation, creating a variant allele, $V$. The second was a copy-neutral Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH), where the remaining wild-type allele was lost and the variant allele was duplicated. This results in a genotype of $V/V$. The total copy number at this locus is also $2$, as the LOH was copy-neutral.\n\nThe problem assumes unbiased sequencing, meaning that every allele copy in the mixture has an equal probability of being sequenced. Therefore, the VAF can be calculated directly from the proportion of variant alleles in the total pool of alleles in the DNA sample.\n\nLet us determine the total number of variant alleles and the total number of alleles in the sample. We can express these quantities in terms of an arbitrary total number of alleles in the sample, $N_{total}$.\n\nSince both normal and tumor cells have a total copy number of $2$ at the $RB1$ locus, the fraction of total alleles contributed by each cell type is directly proportional to their DNA fraction in the sample.\n- The number of alleles contributed by tumor cells is $N_{tumor\\_alleles} = p \\cdot N_{total}$.\n- The number of alleles contributed by normal cells is $N_{normal\\_alleles} = (1-p) \\cdot N_{total}$.\n\nNext, we count the number of variant alleles ($V$) from each population:\n- In the tumor cell population (genotype $V/V$), both copies are the variant allele. Thus, the fraction of variant alleles is $1$. The number of variant alleles from tumor cells is $1 \\cdot N_{tumor\\_alleles} = 1 \\cdot (p \\cdot N_{total}) = p \\cdot N_{total}$.\n- In the normal cell population (genotype $W/W$), there are no variant alleles. The fraction of variant alleles is $0$. The number of variant alleles from normal cells is $0 \\cdot N_{normal\\_alleles} = 0$.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample, $N_{variant}$, is the sum of contributions from both populations:\n$$ N_{variant} = (\\text{variant alleles from tumor}) + (\\text{variant alleles from normal}) $$\n$$ N_{variant} = p \\cdot N_{total} + 0 = p \\cdot N_{total} $$\nThe total number of alleles at the locus, $N_{total}$, is the sum of alleles from the tumor and normal populations:\n$$ N_{total} = N_{tumor\\_alleles} + N_{normal\\_alleles} = p \\cdot N_{total} + (1-p) \\cdot N_{total} = (p + 1 - p) \\cdot N_{total} = N_{total} $$\nNow we can compute the VAF using its definition:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{N_{variant}}{N_{total}} $$\nSubstituting the expression we derived for $N_{variant}$:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = \\frac{p \\cdot N_{total}}{N_{total}} $$\nThe term $N_{total}$ cancels out, yielding the relationship between VAF and purity $p$:\n$$ \\text{VAF} = p $$\nThus, for a clonal mutation in a region of copy-neutral LOH where the mutated allele is duplicated, the expected variant allele fraction is equal to the tumor purity.",

            "problem": "A tumor suppressor locus is profiled by high-throughput sequencing in a mixed sample consisting of tumor cells and non-tumor (normal) cells, in the context of Knudson’s two-hit hypothesis. Assume a matched normal sample indicates germline heterozygosity at the locus with alleles denoted by $A$ and $B$. The tumor sample has tumor purity $p \\in [0,1]$, meaning a fraction $p$ of cells are tumor and a fraction $1-p$ are normal. Within the tumor compartment, the fraction of tumor cells harboring a specific somatic event at the locus (the event clonality) is $c \\in [0,1]$, with the remaining fraction $1-c$ of tumor cells lacking the event. Assume sequencing read depth for a locus is proportional to the total locus copy number in the sample mixture, and that observed B-allele frequency ($\\mathrm{BAF}$) equals the expected fraction of $B$-allele copies among all locus copies in the mixture under idealized, unbiased sampling.\n\nConsider three somatic states at the locus:\n$1.$ Diploid state with no alteration in any tumor cells.\n$2.$ Hemizygous deletion in a fraction $c$ of tumor cells, where the altered tumor cells have copy number $1$ at the locus, and the $1-c$ fraction of tumor cells remain diploid with copy number $2$.

For copy-neutral LOH, derive B-allele frequency both for the scenario in which the duplicated allele in altered tumor cells is $B$ and for the scenario in which it is $A$.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases: the definition of tumor purity $p$ and event clonality $c$, the assumption that read depth scales linearly with locus copy number, and the definition of B-allele frequency as the ratio of expected $B$-allele copies to total locus copies in the mixed sample. Treat the matched normal baseline copy number as $2$, assume the normal cells are heterozygous ($AB$) at the locus, and ignore allelic mapping bias, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) bias, and overdispersion.\n\nDerive closed-form expressions for the expected read depth ratio $R$ (tumor versus matched normal) and B-allele frequency $\\mathrm{BAF}$ for each state as functions of $p$ and $c$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of expressions for the expected read depth ratio $R$ and B-allele frequency $\\mathrm{BAF}$ in a mixed tumor-normal sample under three different somatic scenarios at a heterozygous locus. We are given the tumor purity $p$, the event clonality $c$, and the genotypes of the different cell populations.\n\nLet's establish a general model based on the provided assumptions. The sample is a mixture of three distinct cell populations:\n1.  Normal cells (N): These constitute a fraction $1-p$ of the total cells. They are diploid and heterozygous ($AB$), so their locus copy number is $CN_N = 2$, and their B-allele count is $B_N = 1$.\n2.  Unaltered tumor cells (T_U): These constitute a fraction $p(1-c)$ of the total cells. They are assumed to retain the germline heterozygous state ($AB$) and are diploid, so their copy number is $CN_{T_U} = 2$ and their B-allele count is $B_{T_U} = 1$.\n3.  Altered tumor cells (T_A): These constitute a fraction $pc$ of the total cells. Their copy number, $CN_{T_A}$, and B-allele count, $B_{T_A}$, depend on the specific somatic event.\n\nThe average locus copy number in the mixed sample, $\\langle CN \\rangle$, is the weighted average over these three populations:\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = (1-p)CN_N + p(1-c)CN_{T_U} + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = (1-p)(2) + p(1-c)(2) + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = 2 - 2p + 2p - 2pc + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A} = 2 - 2pc + pc \\cdot CN_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle CN \\rangle = 2 + pc(CN_{T_A} - 2)\n$$\nThe read depth ratio, $R$, is defined as the ratio of $\\langle CN \\rangle$ in the tumor sample to the average copy number in a pure normal sample. A normal sample consists only of diploid cells, so its average copy number is $2$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\langle CN \\rangle}{2} = \\frac{2 + pc(CN_{T_A} - 2)}{2} = 1 + \\frac{pc(CN_{T_A} - 2)}{2}\n$$\nThe B-allele frequency, $\\mathrm{BAF}$, is the ratio of the total number of $B$ alleles to the total number of alleles at the locus. This is equivalent to the ratio of the average B-allele count per cell, $\\langle B \\rangle$, to the average locus copy number per cell, $\\langle CN \\rangle$.\nThe average B-allele count, $\\langle B \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\langle B \\rangle = (1-p)B_N + p(1-c)B_{T_U} + pc \\cdot B_{T_A}\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\n\\langle B \\rangle = (1-p)(1) + p(1-c)(1) + pc \\cdot B_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle B \\rangle = 1 - p + p - pc + pc \\cdot B_{T_A} = 1 - pc + pc \\cdot B_{T_A}\n$$\n$$\n\\langle B \\rangle = 1 + pc(B_{T_A} - 1)\n$$\nTherefore, the general expression for $\\mathrm{BAF}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BAF} = \\frac{\\langle B \\rangle}{\\langle CN \\rangle} = \\frac{1 + pc(B_{T_A} - 1)}{2 + pc(CN_{T_A} - 2)}\n$$\nWe now apply these general formulas to the three specified somatic states.\n\n**1. Diploid state**\nIn this state, there is no alteration in any tumor cells. This means all tumor cells are diploid and heterozygous ($AB$). This scenario is equivalent to setting the properties of the altered tumor cell population ($T_A$) to be identical to the unaltered population ($T_U$).\nThus, for the \"altered\" fraction $pc$, we have $CN_{T_A} = 2$ and $B_{T_A} = 1$.\nSubstituting these into our general equations:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{diploid}}(p,c) = 1 + \\frac{pc(2 - 2)}{2} = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{BAF}_{\\mathrm{diploid}}(p,c) = \\frac{1 + pc(1 - 1)}{2 + pc(2 - 2)} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n\n**2. Hemizygous deletion**\nIn this state, a fraction $c$ of tumor cells has a deletion of one allele, resulting in a copy number of $1$. Thus, $CN_{T_A} = 1$.\nThe read depth ratio is independent of which allele is lost:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{hemidel}}(p,c) = 1 + \\frac{pc(1 - 2)}{2} = 1 - \\frac{pc}{2}\n$$\nThe $\\mathrm{BAF}$ depends on which allele is retained.\n- **Retained allele is $B$**: The genotype of altered cells is $B$. So, $B_{T_A} = 1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{BAF}_{\\mathrm{hemidel}}^{B\\ \\text{retained}}(p,c) = \\frac{1 + pc(1 - 1)}{2 + pc(1 - 2)} = \\frac{1}{2 - pc}\n$$\n- **Retained allele is $A$**: The genotype of altered cells is $A$. So, $B_{T_A} = 0$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{BAF}_{\\mathrm{hemidel}}^{A\\ \\text{retained}}(p,c) = \\frac{1 + pc(0 - 1)}{2 + pc(1 - 2)} = \\frac{1 - pc}{2 - pc}\n$$\n\n**3. Copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH)**\nIn this state, a fraction $c$ of tumor cells has lost heterozygosity but maintains a diploid copy number. Thus, $CN_{T_A} = 2$.\nThe read depth ratio is:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{cnLOH}}(p,c) = 1 + \\frac{pc(2 - 2)}{2} = 1\n$$\nThe $\\mathrm{BAF}$ depends on which allele is duplicated.\n- **Duplicated allele is $B$**: The genotype of altered cells is $BB$. So, $B_{T_A} = 2$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{BAF}_{\\mathrm{cnLOH}}^{B\\ \\text{duplicated}}(p,c) = \\frac{1 + pc(2 - 1)}{2 + pc(2 - 2)} = \\frac{1 + pc}{2}\n$$\n- **Duplicated allele is $A$**: The genotype of altered cells is $AA$.

Assume that somatic mutation events occur as homogeneous Poisson processes over time, and that the mutation processes affecting the two alleles are independent across individuals and time. Consider a family in which a proband carries a pathogenic heterozygous germline variant at this locus. You will quantify the probability that a future sibling develops a neoplasm driven by this locus by combining Mendelian transmission, de novo mutation risk, and the time-dependent probabilities of acquiring the requisite somatic hits.\n\nUse the following context-appropriate bases:\n- Mendelian transmission for an autosomal heterozygous variant: if a parent is constitutionally heterozygous, each offspring has a probability $1/2$ of inheriting the variant.\n- If both parents are constitutionally wild-type, define $\\mu$ as the per-conception probability that a zygote carries a heterozygous de novo pathogenic variant at this locus (accounting for mutations arising in either parental gamete).\n- If one parent has gonadal mosaicism for the variant with mosaic fraction $m$ (that is, a fraction $m$ of that parent’s gametes carry the variant), each conception from that parent has probability $m$ of being heterozygous for the variant.\n- For an individual who is germline heterozygous (one hit present at conception), the “second hit” somatic inactivation is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process with constant rate $\\lambda$ per year.\n- For an individual who is constitutionally wild-type at the locus, the completion of both required somatic hits is modeled as a homogeneous Poisson process with constant rate $\\eta$ per year (this effective rate summarizes the two-step progression under the assumption of rare events and independence).\n\nLet $L$ be the time horizon in years over which disease occurrence is assessed.

It is based on established principles of Mendelian genetics, somatic mutation modeling via Poisson processes (specifically in the context of Knudson's two-hit hypothesis), and probabilistic risk assessment. The parameters provided are defined and fall within plausible biological ranges. The problem is structured to yield unique, meaningful solutions for each of the three specified scenarios. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe core of the problem is to calculate the probability of a neoplasm developing within a time horizon of $L$ years. This probability depends on the individual's constitutional genotype at the specified tumor-suppressor locus. The development of the neoplasm is modeled as the occurrence of at least one event in a homogeneous Poisson process.\n\nFor a random process where events occur at a constant rate $r$ per unit time, the number of events $N(t)$ in a time interval of length $t$ follows a Poisson distribution. The probability of zero events occurring in this interval is $P(N(t)=0) = \\exp(-rt)$. Consequently, the probability of at least one event occurring is $P(N(t) \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N(t)=0) = 1 - \\exp(-rt)$.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an individual develops the neoplasm within the time horizon $L$. We can define the probability of this event, conditional on the individual's genotype.\n\n1.  For an individual who is germline heterozygous, one inactivating somatic event (a \"second hit\") is required. This process has a rate constant of $\\lambda$. The probability of disease for such an individual is:\n    $$P(D | \\text{heterozygous}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda L)$$\n\n2.  For an individual who is constitutionally wild-type, two inactivating somatic events are required. This is modeled as a single effective Poisson process with a rate constant of $\\eta$. The probability of disease for such an individual is:\n    $$P(D | \\text{wild-type}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\eta L)$$\n\nThe total probability that the future sibling develops the disease, $P_{\\text{sib}}(D)$, is found using the law of total probability, conditioned on the sibling's genotype:\n$$P_{\\text{sib}}(D) = P(D | \\text{sibling is heterozygous}) P(\\text{sibling is heterozygous}) + P(D | \\text{sibling is wild-type}) P(\\text{sibling is wild-type})$$\n\nLet $P_{\\text{het}} = P(\\text{sibling is heterozygous})$ for a given scenario.

According to Mendelian genetics for an autosomal locus, the probability of the sibling inheriting the variant from the heterozygous parent is $1/2$.\nThus, $P_{\\text{het}} = 1/2$.\nThe sibling's disease probability, $P_1$, is:\n$$P_1 = (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda L)) \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (1 - \\exp(-\\eta L)) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$P_1 = \\frac{1}{2} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda L) + 1 - \\exp(-\\eta L)) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(-\\lambda L) + \\exp(-\\eta L))$$\n\n**Scenario 2: The proband's variant arose de novo.**\nBoth parents are constitutionally wild-type. A future sibling would be heterozygous only if a new de novo mutation occurs. The problem defines this per-conception probability as $\\mu$.\nThus, $P_{\\text{het}} = \\mu$.\nThe sibling's disease probability, $P_2$, is:\n$$P_2 = (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda L)) \\mu + (1 - \\exp(-\\eta L)) (1 - \\mu)$$\n\n**Scenario 3: One parent has gonadal mosaicism with fraction $m$.**\nOne parent is constitutionally wild-type but carries the mutation in a fraction $m$ of their gametes. The probability that a conception from this parent results in a heterozygous zygote is $m$.\nThus, $P_{\\text{het}} = m$.\nThe sibling's disease probability, $P_3$, is:\n$$P_3 = (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda L)) m + (1 - \\exp(-\\eta L)) (1 - m)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the probabilities.\nThe given parameters are:\n$L = 50$ years\n$\\lambda = 0.02$ year$^{-1}$\n$\\eta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4}$ year$^{-1}$\n$\\mu = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}$\n$m = 0.08$\n\nFirst, we calculate the exponents for the Poisson probabilities:\n$\\lambda L = (0.02)(\\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (50)(\\text{year}) = 1.0$\n$\\eta L = (2.0 \\times 10^{-4})(\\text{year}^{-1}) \\times (50)(\\text{year}) = 100 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.01$\n\nNext, we compute the conditional probabilities of disease:\n$P(D | \\text{heterozygous}) = 1 - \\exp(-1.0)$\n$P(D | \\text{wild-type}) = 1 - \\exp(-0.01)$\n\nLet's compute the values for $P_1$, $P_2$, and $P_3$.\n\nFor Scenario 1:\n$P_1 = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(-1.0) + \\exp(-0.01))$\n$P_1 \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(0.36787944 + 0.99004983) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(1.35792927) = 1 - 0.678964635$\n$P_1 \\approx 0.321035365$\nRounding to four significant figures, $P_1 \\approx 0.3210$.\n\nFor Scenario 2:\n$P_2 = (1 - \\exp(-1.0)) \\mu + (1 - \\exp(-0.01)) (1 - \\mu)$\n$P_2 \\approx (1 - 0.36787944)(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) + (1 - 0.99004983)(1 - 3.0 \\times 10^{-5})$\n$P_2 \\approx (0.63212056)(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}) + (0.00995017)(0.99997)$\n$P_2 \\approx 1.89636 \\times 10^{-5} + 0.0099498715$\n$P_2 \\approx 0.009968835$\nRounding to four significant figures, $P_2 \\approx 0.009969$.\n\nFor Scenario 3:\n$P_3 = (1 - \\exp(-1.0)) m + (1 - \\exp(-0.01)) (1 - m)$\n$P_3 \\approx (0.63212056)(0.08) + (0.00995017)(1 - 0.08)$\n$P_3 \\approx (0.63212056)(0.08) + (0.00995017)(0.92)$\n$P_3 \\approx 0.050569645 + 0.009154156$\n$P_3 \\approx 0.059723801$\nRounding to four significant figures, $P_3 \\approx 0.05972$.\n\nThe three sibling disease probabilities, for scenarios 1, 2, and 3 respectively, are approximately $0.3210$, $0.009969$, and $0.05972$.",
