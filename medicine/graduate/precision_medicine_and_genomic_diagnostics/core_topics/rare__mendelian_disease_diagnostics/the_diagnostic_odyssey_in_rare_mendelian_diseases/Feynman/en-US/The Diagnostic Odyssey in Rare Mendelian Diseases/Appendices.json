The Hardy-Weinberg principle serves as a foundational model in population genetics, allowing us to estimate the prevalence of a Mendelian disease from the frequency of the pathogenic allele. This exercise  provides a hands-on application of this principle to calculate the expected baseline prevalence for a rare autosomal recessive condition, a critical first step in planning public health strategies and clinical studies.",

            "problem": "A regional genomics center is planning a prospective study to shorten the diagnostic odyssey for families affected by a rare autosomal recessive Mendelian disease. To estimate the baseline burden in an unselected newborn population under routine care (before genome sequencing is employed), the center wishes to compute the expected disease prevalence under the following assumptions: random mating, large population size, no selection, no mutation, no migration, and complete (full) penetrance for an individual with two pathogenic alleles. Let the pathogenic allele frequency be $q = 0.001$ in this population, and let $p$ denote the frequency of the reference (non-pathogenic) allele, where $p + q = 1$. Using the definitions and consequences of Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, derive from first principles the expected disease prevalence in the population and report the value as a decimal fraction. Round your final answer to four significant figures and do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "To compute the expected prevalence of an autosomal recessive disease under the stated assumptions, we begin from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, which is a well-tested foundational model in population genetics. Under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, for a bi-allelic locus with reference allele frequency $p$ and pathogenic allele frequency $q$ satisfying $p + q = 1$, the genotype frequencies in a large, randomly mating population with no evolutionary forces are:\n$$\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{homozygous reference} = p^{2}, \\quad\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{heterozygotes} = 2pq, \\quad\n\\text{Frequency of } \\text{homozygous pathogenic} = q^{2}.\n$$\nFor an autosomal recessive disease with complete penetrance (that is, every individual with two pathogenic alleles is affected, while heterozygotes and homozygous reference individuals are unaffected), the disease prevalence in the population is equal to the frequency of the homozygous pathogenic genotype:\n$$\nP_{\\text{disease}} = q^{2}.\n$$\nThis result follows directly from the definition of an autosomal recessive trait and the Hardy–Weinberg genotype frequency distribution. The assumption of complete penetrance implies that there is a one-to-one mapping between the homozygous pathogenic genotype and the affected phenotype.\n\nWe are given $q = 0.001$.

This exercise  simulates a common scenario in modern genomic diagnostics where next-generation sequencing data is used for read-backed phasing.

For autosomal recessive disease, biallelic pathogenic variants must reside on different homologous chromosomes (in trans) to confer disease causality under standard Mendelian inheritance. Phased parental genotypes are available: the father is heterozygous at variant $V_1$ and homozygous reference at variant $V_2$, while the mother is homozygous reference at variant $V_1$ and heterozygous at variant $V_2$. This segregation pattern provides a strong pre-test prior for the proband’s two variants being in trans. Assume a prior probability $P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}})=0.99$ and $P(H_{\\mathrm{cis}})=0.01$, where $H_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{cis}}$ denote the hypotheses that the two heterozygous variants in the proband are in trans or in cis, respectively.\n\nPaired-end read-backed phasing yields $N=120$ read pairs that confidently span both $V_1$ and $V_2$ in the proband, each reporting alleles at both sites. Let the observed counts be categorized as follows: $k_{\\mathrm{AR}}=56$ reads show the alternate allele at $V_1$ and the reference allele at $V_2$, $k_{\\mathrm{RA}}=58$ reads show the reference allele at $V_1$ and the alternate allele at $V_2$, $k_{\\mathrm{AA}}=3$ reads show alternate alleles at both $V_1$ and $V_2$, and $k_{\\mathrm{RR}}=3$ reads show reference alleles at both $V_1$ and $V_2$. Assume the following error model: each locus in a read pair is called independently and correctly with probability $(1-\\varepsilon)$, and when an error occurs at a locus it flips the observed allele to the other state (alternate to reference or reference to alternate) with probability $\\varepsilon$, with $\\varepsilon=0.01$. Assume equal sampling of the two chromosomal haplotypes that carry the proband’s variants (i.e., half the spanning reads originate from each homolog under either hypothesis), independent across read pairs.\n\nStarting from the definitions of autosomal recessive inheritance and Bayes’ rule, and modeling the read-pair category probabilities under $H_{\\mathrm{trans}}$ and $H_{\\mathrm{cis}}$ given the per-locus error model, derive the posterior probability $P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}}\\mid \\text{data})$ that the two variants are in trans.

Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, calculate the probabilities and counts:\n- $\\varepsilon = 0.01$, $c = 1-\\varepsilon = 0.99$.\n- $p_{\\mathrm{maj}} = 0.5(0.99^2 + 0.01^2) = 0.5(0.9801 + 0.0001) = 0.5(0.9802) = 0.4901$.\n- $p_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.99 \\times 0.01 = 0.0099$.\n- $k_{\\mathrm{trans\\_like}} = 56 + 58 = 114$.\n- $k_{\\mathrm{cis\\_like}} = 3 + 3 = 6$.\n- The exponent for the BF is $114 - 6 = 108$.\n\nNow, calculate the Bayes Factor:\n$$ \\mathrm{BF} = \\left(\\frac{0.4901}{0.0099}\\right)^{108} = \\left(\\frac{4901}{99}\\right)^{108} $$\nThe prior odds are:\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{prior}} = \\frac{P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}})}{P(H_{\\mathrm{cis}})} = \\frac{0.99}{0.01} = 99 $$\nThe posterior odds are:\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{post}} = \\mathrm{BF} \\times O_{\\mathrm{prior}} = \\left(\\frac{4901}{99}\\right)^{108} \\times 99 $$\nThis is an extremely large number. To find the posterior probability $P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\mid \\text{data})$ without loss of precision, we use the formula:\n$$ P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\mid \\text{data}) = \\frac{1}{1 + O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1}} = \\frac{1}{1 + (\\mathrm{BF} \\times O_{\\mathrm{prior}})^{-1}} $$\n$$ O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1} = \\left(\\frac{99}{4901}\\right)^{108} \\times \\frac{1}{99} = \\frac{99^{107}}{4901^{108}} $$\nTo compute this small value, we use logarithms:\n$$ \\ln(O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1}) = 107 \\ln(99) - 108 \\ln(4901) $$\nUsing standard values for natural logarithms:\n$\\ln(99) \\approx 4.59511985$\n$\\ln(4901) \\approx 8.50735581$\n$$ \\ln(O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1}) \\approx 107 \\times 4.59511985 - 108 \\times 8.50735581 $$\n$$ \\ln(O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1}) \\approx 491.677824 - 918.794427 \\approx -427.116603 $$\nSo, $O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1} = \\exp(-427.116603)$, which is a value extremely close to zero, approximately $1.5455 \\times 10^{-186}$.\nThe posterior probability is:\n$$ P(H_{\\mathrm{trans}} \\mid \\text{data}) = 1 - O_{\\mathrm{post}}^{-1} = 1 - 1.5455 \\times 10^{-186} $$\nThis result is $0.999...$, with $185$ nines following the decimal point before any other digit appears.\n\n**4.

The evidence codes applied are PM2 (Absent/Rare in population databases; considered Moderate pathogenic evidence), PP3 (Multiple computational lines of evidence support a deleterious effect; considered Supporting pathogenic evidence), and PS3 (Well-established functional studies show a damaging effect; considered Strong pathogenic evidence).

The most direct method is to work with odds rather than probabilities, as the evidence is provided in the form of odds multipliers, which are equivalent to likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $H$ be the hypothesis that the variant is pathogenic, and $\\neg H$ be the hypothesis that it is benign. The probability of pathogenicity is denoted by $P(H)$.\n\nThe prior probability of pathogenicity is given as $p_0$:\n$$p_0 = P(H) = 0.001$$\n\nThe odds in favor of a hypothesis are defined as the ratio of the probability of the hypothesis being true to the probability of it being false.
