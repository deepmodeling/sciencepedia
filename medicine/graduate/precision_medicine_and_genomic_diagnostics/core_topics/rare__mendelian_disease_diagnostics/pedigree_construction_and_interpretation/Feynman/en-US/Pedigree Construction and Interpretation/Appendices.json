This exercise tasks you with deriving the coefficient of relationship ($r$) between an uncle and niece directly from the principles of Mendelian segregation, rather than relying on memorized values. By tracing the flow of alleles from common ancestors, you will solidify your understanding of identity by descent (IBD), the conceptual bedrock of quantitative genetics .",

            "problem": "Consider a three-generation autosomal pedigree relevant to variant segregation in precision medicine. Generation I consists of two unrelated, non-inbred founders, a grandfather $G_f$ and a grandmother $G_m$. Generation II contains their two children, an uncle $U$ and a parent $P$. Generation III contains a niece $N$, who is the biological child of $P$ and an unrelated, non-inbred spouse $S$. Assume the following foundational rules: (i) Mendelian segregation in each meiosis transmits one of two alleles with probability $1/2$, (ii) founders’ homologous alleles are distinct lineages under the identity-by-descent framework, (iii) there is no selection, mutation, or linkage affecting transmission probabilities across the described paths, and (iv) all founders are mutually unrelated and non-inbred, making identity-by-descent contributions via distinct founders mutually exclusive.\n\nStarting from the definition that identity by descent (IBD) refers to two alleles being copies of the same ancestral allele and that the kinship coefficient $\\phi_{XY}$ is the probability that one allele sampled at random from individual $X$ and one allele sampled at random from individual $Y$ are IBD, derive the coefficient of relationship $r_{UN}$ between the uncle $U$ and niece $N$ by summing the path contributions through all shared ancestors in Generation I, using only the fundamental $1/2$ transmission rule and the requirement that both sampled alleles trace back to the same specific allele in the founder. Provide your final answer as an exact value with no rounding. Verify that the value you obtain equals $0.25$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the coefficient of relationship ($r_{UN}$) between an uncle ($U$) and his niece ($N$). The problem states we should use the kinship coefficient ($\\phi_{XY}$), which is the probability that a randomly sampled allele from individual $X$ and a randomly sampled allele from individual $Y$ are identical by descent (IBD). For non-inbred individuals, the coefficient of relationship is $r_{XY} = 2\\phi_{XY}$.\n\n**Step 1: Verify individuals are non-inbred.**\nThe founders $G_f$ and $G_m$ are non-inbred, so their inbreeding coefficient $F$ is 0.\n- Uncle $U$: His parents are $G_f$ and $G_m$, who are unrelated. Therefore, $F_U = \\phi_{G_f G_m} = 0$.\n- Niece $N$: Her parents are $P$ and $S$. $P$'s parents are $G_f$ and $G_m$, who are unrelated, so $F_P = 0$. $S$ is an unrelated, non-inbred spouse. As $P$ and $S$ are unrelated, $F_N = \\phi_{PS} = 0$.\nSince both $U$ and $N$ are non-inbred, the formula $r_{UN} = 2\\phi_{UN}$ is valid.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the kinship coefficient $\\phi_{UN}$ by summing path contributions.**\nThe kinship coefficient $\\phi_{UN}$ can be calculated by summing the probabilities of IBD through each common ancestor. The common ancestors of $U$ and $N$ are the grandfather ($G_f$) and the grandmother ($G_m$).\n$$\n\\phi_{UN} = P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) + P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_m)\n$$\nwhere $A_U$ and $A_N$ are randomly sampled alleles.\n\nLet's calculate the contribution from the grandfather, $G_f$. The general formula for the contribution of a single common ancestor $A$ to the kinship coefficient between individuals $X$ and $Y$ is $(\\frac{1}{2})^{n+m+1}(1+F_A)$, where $n$ is the number of generations from $A$ to $X$, $m$ is the number of generations from $A$ to $Y$, and $F_A$ is the inbreeding coefficient of the ancestor.\n\n- For the path through $G_f$:\n  - The path from $G_f$ to $U$ is one generation ($n=1$).\n  - The path from $G_f$ to $N$ is two generations ($G_f \\to P \\to N$, so $m=2$).\n  - The ancestor $G_f$ is a founder and thus non-inbred ($F_{G_f}=0$).\n  - The contribution to kinship from $G_f$ is:\n    $$\n    P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_f) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+2+1} (1+0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n    $$\n- For the path through $G_m$:\n  - The pedigree is symmetric with respect to the founders. The path from $G_m$ to $U$ is one generation ($n=1$), and the path from $G_m$ to $N$ is two generations ($m=2$).\n  - The ancestor $G_m$ is also non-inbred ($F_{G_m}=0$).\n  - The contribution to kinship from $G_m$ is identical:\n    $$\n    P(A_U \\equiv A_N \\text{ via } G_m) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1+2+1} (1+0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{16}\n    $$\n\n**Step 3: Sum contributions and calculate the coefficient of relationship $r_{UN}$.**\nThe total kinship coefficient is the sum of the contributions from all common ancestors:\n$$\n\\phi_{UN} = \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{2}{16} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the coefficient of relationship:\n$$\nr_{UN} = 2\\phi_{UN} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis derived value of $1/4$ is equal to $0.25$, which verifies the result as requested.",

            "introduction": "The analysis of consanguineous pedigrees is a critical skill in clinical genetics, as it informs the risk of autosomal recessive disorders. This practice builds upon the concept of kinship to calculate the coefficient of inbreeding ($F$) for the offspring of two different types of related unions.

            "problem": "In precision medicine and genomic diagnostics, the coefficient of inbreeding, denoted by $F$, informs the probability that an individual’s two alleles at a given locus are identical by descent from a common ancestor, directly affecting the expected burden of recessive disease variants in pedigrees with consanguinity. Consider the following scientifically realistic pedigree constructed for interpretive analysis.\n\nTwo mutually unrelated and non-inbred founders $P$ and $Q$ have two children, $B$ and $C$, who are full siblings. Individual $B$ mates with an unrelated and non-inbred spouse $S_{1}$ and has offspring $D$. Individual $C$ mates with an unrelated and non-inbred spouse $S_{2}$ and has offspring $E$.

Express your final answer as a two-entry row matrix $(F_{X}, F_{Y})$ in exact fractional form. No rounding is required and no units are to be included.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the coefficient of inbreeding, denoted by $F$, for the offspring in two different consanguineous mating scenarios. The coefficient of inbreeding of an individual is defined as the probability that the two alleles at a given locus in that individual are identical by descent (IBD). A fundamental principle in pedigree analysis is that the coefficient of inbreeding of an individual is equal to the coefficient of kinship of their parents. The coefficient of kinship, $\\phi(I, J)$, between two individuals $I$ and $J$ is the probability that an allele chosen at random from $I$ and an allele chosen at random from $J$ at the same locus are IBD.\n\nTherefore, for the two scenarios, we must compute:\n1. $F_X = \\phi(C, D)$ for Scenario 1.\n2. $F_Y = \\phi(D, E)$ for Scenario 2.\n\nWe are given that the founders $P$, $Q$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ are non-inbred and mutually unrelated. This provides the following initial conditions:\n- The inbreeding coefficient for each founder is zero: $F_P = 0$, $F_Q = 0$, $F_{S_1} = 0$, $F_{S_2} = 0$.\n- The kinship coefficient between any two distinct founders is zero: $\\phi(P, Q) = 0$, $\\phi(P, S_1) = 0$, etc.\n\nThe coefficient of kinship can be calculated using a recursive approach. For any two individuals $I$ and $J$, where the parents of $J$ are $M$ and $F_{parent}$, the kinship coefficient is given by:\n$$\n\\phi(I, J) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(I, M) + \\phi(I, F_{parent}) \\right]\n$$\nThe kinship coefficient of an individual with themselves is related to their inbreeding coefficient:\n$$\n\\phi(I, I) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + F_I)\n$$\n\nFirst, we establish the kinship between the full siblings $B$ and $C$, whose parents are $P$ and $Q$.\n$$\n\\phi(B, C) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(B, P) + \\phi(B, Q) \\right]\n$$\nTo find $\\phi(B, P)$, we note that $B$ is the offspring of $P$ and $Q$.\n$$\n\\phi(B, P) = \\phi(P, B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(P, P) + \\phi(P, Q) \\right]\n$$\nGiven the initial conditions, $\\phi(P, Q) = 0$. The kinship of $P$ with itself is $\\phi(P, P) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + F_P) = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + 0) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThus, $\\phi(B, P) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} + 0 \\right] = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSimilarly, $\\phi(B, Q) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(Q, P) + \\phi(Q, Q) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 0 + \\frac{1}{2}(1 + F_Q) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\phi(B, C)$:\n$$\n\\phi(B, C) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\nThe kinship coefficient between full siblings with non-inbred, unrelated parents is $\\frac{1}{4}$, a standard result.\n\nNow we can analyze the two scenarios.\n\n**Scenario 1: Avuncular mating**\nWe need to calculate $F_X = \\phi(C, D)$. The parents of $X$ are $C$ and $D$. The parents of $D$ are $B$ and $S_1$.\nUsing the recursive formula for kinship:\n$$\nF_X = \\phi(C, D) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(C, B) + \\phi(C, S_1) \\right]\n$$\nWe have already determined the kinship between siblings $B$ and $C$ to be $\\phi(C, B) = \\phi(B, C) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nSince individual $C$ and the founder $S_1$ are unrelated, their kinship coefficient is $\\phi(C, S_1) = 0$. This is because $S_1$ shares no recent common ancestors with $C$ (whose ancestors are $P$ and $Q$).\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nF_X = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4} + 0 \\right] = \\frac{1}{8}.\n$$\n\n**Scenario 2: First-cousin mating**\nWe need to calculate $F_Y = \\phi(D, E)$. The parents of $Y$ are $D$ and $E$. The parents of $D$ are $B$ and $S_1$, and the parents of $E$ are $C$ and $S_2$.\nUsing the recursive formula, we can express $\\phi(D, E)$ in terms of the kinship of $D$ with $E$'s parents, $C$ and $S_2$:\n$$\nF_Y = \\phi(D, E) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\phi(D, C) + \\phi(D, S_2) \\right]\n$$\nSince $D$ and $S_2$ are unrelated (ancestors of $D$ are $P, Q, S_1$; $S_2$ is an unrelated founder), $\\phi(D, S_2) = 0$.\nSo the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nF_Y = \\frac{1}{2} \\phi(D, C)\n$$\nWe recognize that $\\phi(D, C)$ is the same as $\\phi(C, D)$, which we calculated in Scenario 1.\n$$\n\\phi(D, C) = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\nF_Y = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{8} \\right) = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\nAlternatively, we can expand $\\phi(D, E)$ in terms of all four of their parents ($B, S_1, C, S_2$):\n$$\n\\phi(D, E) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ \\phi(B, C) + \\phi(B, S_2) + \\phi(S_1, C) + \\phi(S_1, S_2) \\right]\n$$\nGiven that founders $S_1$ and $S_2$ are unrelated to the family line of $P, Q, B, C$ and to each other, the kinship coefficients involving them are zero:\n$\\phi(B, S_2) = 0$\n$\\phi(S_1, C) = 0$\n$\\phi(S_1, S_2) = 0$\nThe expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\phi(D, E) = \\frac{1}{4} \\phi(B, C)\n$$\nUsing our earlier result that $\\phi(B, C) = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$\nF_Y = \\phi(D, E) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right) = \\frac{1}{16}.\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The coefficient of inbreeding for the offspring of an avuncular mating is $F_X = \\frac{1}{8}$, and for a first-cousin mating is $F_Y = \\frac{1}{16}$.\n\nThe final answer is to be expressed as a two-entry row matrix $(F_X, F_Y)$.",

The father has been genotyped and is homozygous for the reference allele at this locus. Assume classical Mendelian segregation, such that for any autosomal locus a heterozygous parent transmits the pathogenic allele with probability $1/2$. Assume complete imprint-reset in gametogenesis and complete monoallelic expression, meaning the imprinted (silenced) parental allele contributes no functional transcript in the offspring.\n\nThree mechanistic models are considered for recurrence risk in the next child:\n- Paternal imprinting (the paternal allele is silenced; only the maternal allele is expressed).\n- Maternal imprinting (the maternal allele is silenced; only the paternal allele is expressed).\n- Nonimprinted autosomal dominant (first occurrence; both alleles are equally expressed), with incomplete penetrance.\n\nLet the penetrance when the expressed allele carries the pathogenic variant be $p = 0.9$ under imprinting, and let the penetrance under the nonimprinted autosomal dominant model be $q = 0.8$.

The father is homozygous for the reference allele, so his genotype is $vv$.\n\nAccording to classical Mendelian segregation, a heterozygous parent transmits each of their two alleles with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The father can only transmit the $v$ allele. Therefore, the possible genotypes for an offspring and their associated probabilities are:\n1. Offspring inherits $V$ from the mother and $v$ from the father. The genotype is $Vv$.

This allele is expressed. The probability of being clinically affected is the penetrance, $p$.\n- For an offspring with genotype $vv$, the maternally inherited allele is $v$. This allele is expressed. Since it is the reference allele, the child cannot be affected.
