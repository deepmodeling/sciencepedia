            "problem": "A gene-level case-control burden analysis is conducted for a single gene using a standardized evidence-based curation workflow consistent with the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) framework for gene–disease validity. A cohort of $500$ clinically well-phenotyped cases and $1500$ ancestry-matched controls is assembled. After rigorous quality control, $12$ cases and $3$ controls carry qualifying variants in the gene. Assume the margins (row totals and column totals) of the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table are fixed by study design, and adopt the null hypothesis that variant carriage is independent of disease status in this study population.\n\nStarting from the definition of Fisher’s exact test under fixed margins and the independence assumption, derive the exact probability mass function appropriate for the number of qualifying variant carriers in the case cohort. Use this to construct the two-sided exact $p$-value for the observed data by summing over all tables that are at least as extreme as the observed table in the sense of having probability less than or equal to the observed table under the null.\n\nLet the cell counts be: cases with qualifying variants $a = 12$, cases without qualifying variants $b = 488$, controls with qualifying variants $c = 3$, and controls without qualifying variants $d = 1497$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a two-sided Fisher's exact test $p$-value for a gene-level case-control burden analysis.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem by constructing a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table with the given data. Let the cell counts be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n- $a$: cases with qualifying variants\n- $b$: cases without qualifying variants\n- $c$: controls with qualifying variants\n- $d$: controls without qualifying variants\n\nThe data provided are: a cohort of $500$ cases and $1500$ controls. Among them, $12$ cases and $3$ controls carry qualifying variants. This gives the following observed table:\n- $a = 12$\n- $c = 3$\n- Total cases = $a+b = 500 \\implies b = 500 - 12 = 488$\n- Total controls = $c+d = 1500 \\implies d = 1500 - 3 = 1497$\n\nThe contingency table is:\n|            | Cases | Controls | Row Total |\n|------------|-------|----------|-----------|\n| Variant    |  $12$ |   $3$    |  $15$     |\n| No Variant | $488$ |  $1497$  |  $1985$   |\n| Col Total  | $500$ |  $1500$  |  $2000$   |\n\nThe problem specifies that the margins of the table are fixed. These fixed margins are:\n- Row 1 Total (Total with variant), $R_1 = a+c = 15$\n- Row 2 Total (Total without variant), $R_2 = b+d = 1985$\n- Column 1 Total (Total cases), $C_1 = a+b = 500$\n- Column 2 Total (Total controls), $C_2 = c+d = 1500$\n- Grand Total, $n = a+b+c+d = 2000$\n\nThe null hypothesis ($H_0$) is that variant carriage is independent of disease status. Under $H_0$ and with fixed margins, the probability of observing a particular set of cell counts ($a, b, c, d$) is given by the hypergeometric distribution. Let $X$ be the random variable representing the number of qualifying variant carriers in the case cohort (the value in cell $a$). The probability mass function (PMF) for $X$ is derived by considering the number of ways to choose $C_1=500$ individuals to be cases from the total population of $n=2000$. The number of ways to get exactly $x$ variant carriers among the cases is to choose $x$ individuals from the $R_1=15$ total variant carriers and $C_1-x=500-x$ individuals from the $R_2=1985$ total non-carriers.\n\nThe PMF for $X=x$ is therefore:\n$$P(X=x) = \\frac{\\binom{R_1}{x} \\binom{R_2}{C_1-x}}{\\binom{n}{C_1}}$$\nSubstituting the fixed margins from our problem, the specific PMF is:\n$$P(X=x) = \\frac{\\binom{15}{x}\\binom{1985}{500-x}}{\\binom{2000}{500}}$$\nThe possible values for $x$ are integers constrained by the arguments of the binomial coefficients, which must be non-negative. This implies $0 \\le x \\le 15$ and $0 \\le 500-x \\le 1985$, which simplifies to the support $x \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 15\\}$.\n\nThe observed value in the study is $a_{obs} = 12$. The probability of observing this specific table is:\n$$P_{obs} = P(X=12) = \\frac{\\binom{15}{12}\\binom{1985}{488}}{\\binom{2000}{500}}$$\n\nThe problem requires constructing the two-sided exact $p$-value by summing the probabilities of all tables that are as extreme as or more extreme than the observed one. \"More extreme\" is defined as having a probability less than or equal to the probability of the observed table. The $p$-value is thus:\n$$p = \\sum_{x \\,:\\, P(X=x) \\le P_{obs}} P(X=x)$$\nwhere the sum is over all possible values of $x$ in its support, $\\{0, 1, \\dots, 15\\}$.\n\nTo determine which values of $x$ satisfy this condition, we analyze the shape of the PMF. The hypergeometric distribution is unimodal. The mode occurs near the expected value $E[X] = \\frac{R_1 C_1}{n} = \\frac{15 \\times 500}{2000} = 3.75$. The distribution's peak will be at $x=4$. The probabilities $P(X=x)$ will increase for $x \\le 4$ and decrease for $x \\ge 4$.\n\nOur observed value is $a_{obs} = 12$, which is far into the upper tail of the distribution. Since the PMF is monotonically decreasing for $x \\ge 4$, all values $x > 12$ will have probabilities smaller than $P(X=12)$. Thus, the probabilities for $x=12, 13, 14, 15$ must be included in the sum for the $p$-value.\nWe must also check the lower tail (i.e., $x  12$). Since the PMF is decreasing for $x \\ge 4$, we have $P(X=12)  P(X=11)  \\dots  P(X=4)$. What remains is to compare $P(X=12)$ with probabilities in the increasing part of the distribution, $P(X=0), P(X=1), P(X=2), P(X=3)$. Due to the significant skew of the observed values ($12$ vs. an expectation of $3.75$), the probabilities in the lower tail are substantially larger than those in the extreme upper tail. For instance, comparing $P(X=0)$ with $P(X=12)$:\n$$ \\frac{P(X=0)}{P(X=12)} = \\frac{\\binom{15}{0}\\binom{1985}{500}}{\\binom{15}{12}\\binom{1985}{488}} = \\frac{1}{\\binom{15}{3}} \\prod_{i=0}^{11} \\frac{1497-i}{500-i} = \\frac{1}{455} \\prod_{i=0}^{11} \\frac{1497-i}{500-i} $$\nEach term in the product is approximately $3$, so the product is a very large number, far exceeding $455$. Thus, $P(X=0) \\gg P(X=12)$. Since the PMF increases from $x=0$ to $x=4$, it is certain that $P(X=x) > P(X=12)$ for all $x \\le 11$.\nTherefore, the only values of $x$ for which $P(X=x) \\le P(X=12)$ are $x=12, 13, 14,$ and $15$.\n\nThe two-sided $p$-value simplifies to the sum of probabilities in the upper tail starting from the observed value:\n$$p = \\sum_{x=12}^{15} P(X=x) = P(X=12) + P(X=13) + P(X=14) + P(X=15)$$\nSubstituting the PMF expression, we obtain the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$p = \\frac{\\binom{15}{12}\\binom{1985}{488}}{\\binom{2000}{500}} + \\frac{\\binom{15}{13}\\binom{1985}{487}}{\\binom{2000}{500}} + \\frac{\\binom{15}{14}\\binom{1985}{486}}{\\binom{2000}{500}} + \\frac{\\binom{15}{15}\\binom{1985}{485}}{\\binom{2000}{500}}$$\nThis can be written as a single fraction:\n$$p = \\frac{\\binom{15}{12}\\binom{1985}{488} + \\binom{15}{13}\\binom{1985}{487} + \\binom{15}{14}\\binom{1985}{486} + \\binom{15}{15}\\binom{1985}{485}}{\\binom{2000}{500}}$$\n\nFor interpretation, the magnitude of this $p$-value is very small. The observed frequency of variants in cases ($12/500 = 2.4\\%$) is twelve times higher than in controls ($3/1500 = 0.2\\%$), corresponding to a large odds ratio of approximately $12.2$. Such a large deviation from the null expectation ($E[X]=3.75$) results in a $p$-value on the order of $10^{-4}$. In the context of evidence-based gene-disease curation, such as the framework developed by the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen), this result constitutes strong statistical evidence. The ClinGen framework assesses evidence from multiple domains (genetic, experimental, etc.) to classify the strength of a gene-disease relationship. A well-designed case-control study showing a large effect size (odds ratio) and a highly significant $p$-value (e.g., $p  0.001$) provides a substantial number of points toward establishing the gene-disease link as \"Moderate,\" \"Strong,\" or \"Definitive.\" This statistical evidence is critical for translating genomic findings into clinical practice, for example, by justifying the inclusion of the gene on diagnostic panels for precision medicine.",

            "problem": "A gene $G$ is under evidence-based curation for association with an autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorder $D$ using the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Gene–Disease Clinical Validity Framework. For this problem, assume the following framework elements, each treated as well-tested rules in the curated assessment:\n\n- Genetic evidence is capped at $12$ points and is composed of case-level variant evidence and segregation evidence.\n- Case-level de novo variant evidence for autosomal dominant conditions contributes $2$ points for each confirmed de novo variant in an unrelated proband with a phenotype specific to $D$, and $1$ point for each de novo event that is plausible but not confirmed. All case-level variant evidence contributes toward the $12$-point cap for genetic evidence.\n- Segregation evidence is evaluated by aggregating the logarithm of the odds (LOD) across pedigrees. Under a fully penetrant autosomal dominant model with no recombinants observed, if there are $m$ informative meioses (transmissions where the variant status would be informative for co-segregation), the probability of perfect concordance by chance is $(0.5)^{m}$, and the likelihood ratio for co-segregation versus random assortment is $2^{m}$. The LOD is defined as $\\log_{10}(2^{m}) = m \\log_{10}(2)$. Across pedigrees, LODs are additive. Convert the combined LOD to segregation points by the following mapping: if $1 \\leq \\text{LOD}  2$, assign $0.5$ points; if $2 \\leq \\text{LOD}  3$, assign $1.0$ points; if $3 \\leq \\text{LOD}  5$, assign $1.5$ points; if $\\text{LOD} \\geq 5$, assign $3.0$ points. Segregation points are capped at $3.0$ and contribute to the $12$-point genetic evidence cap.\n- Experimental evidence is capped at $6$ points. For this scenario, limited functional data is available: assign $0.5$ points for a patient-derived cellular assay showing consistent functional alteration and $0.5$ points for expression data showing relevant spatiotemporal expression consistent with $D$; together these contribute to the experimental evidence category.\n- Classification mapping based on the total score $S$ is: “Limited” for $1 \\leq S \\leq 6$, “Moderate” for $7 \\leq S \\leq 11$, and “Strong” for $12 \\leq S \\leq 18$. “Definitive” requires a “Strong” score plus replication of evidence over time; assume replication over time is not satisfied in this scenario.\n\nYou are given a mixed-evidence case for $G$–$D$:\n\n- There are $3$ unrelated probands, each with a confirmed de novo protein-truncating variant in $G$ and a phenotype highly specific to $D$.\n- There are $2$ additional unrelated probands with plausible but unconfirmed de novo missense variants in $G$, predicted damaging and consistent with $D$.\n- There are two pedigrees with an inherited variant in $G$ consistent with the proposed mechanism. In Family $1$, there are $m_{1} = 4$ informative meioses with perfect concordance (no recombinants). In Family $2$, there are $m_{2} = 2$ informative meioses with perfect concordance (no recombinants).\n- Functional data are limited to a single patient-derived cellular assay showing decreased activity of the gene product ($0.5$ points) and expression data showing that $G$ is expressed in the developing brain regions implicated in $D$ ($0.5$ points).\n\nAssume there is no convincing contradictory evidence.

The disorder is autosomal dominant. For a rare allele with frequency $f$ (where $f \\ll 1$), under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequency of heterozygous carriers is approximately $2f$. The frequency of homozygous carriers, $f^2$, is negligible. Given a constant penetrance $\\pi$, the prevalence of the disease attributable to this variant, $P_{\\text{variant}}$, is the product of the carrier frequency and the penetrance:\n$$P_{\\text{variant}} = (2f) \\pi$$\n\nNext, we determine the maximum possible disease prevalence that can be attributed to this variant, given the constraints. The overall prevalence of the disease is $P$. A maximum fraction $g$ of disease cases can be attributed to the gene in question, so the maximum prevalence for the gene is $P \\times g$. Of those cases, a maximum fraction $a$ can be attributed to the specific variant.
