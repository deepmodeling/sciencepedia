Under CLIA/CAP, intermediate precision encompasses variability attributable to day, operator, day-by-operator interaction, and within-cell residual error. Treat both day and operator as random effects.\n\nStarting from foundational principles:\n- Intermediate precision standard deviation is defined as the square root of the sum of relevant random-effect variance components (day, operator, day-by-operator interaction, residual).\n- The coefficient of variation (CV) is defined as $CV = \\sigma / \\mu$, where $\\sigma$ is the intermediate precision standard deviation and $\\mu$ is the overall mean of the measurements. Report $CV$ as a decimal fraction (not a percent).\n\nA balanced two-way crossed design was performed with $a=3$ days, $b=2$ operators, and $n=3$ replicate measurements per day-operator cell on a $10\\%$ VAF control material. The observed VAF measurements (unitless fractions) are:\n\n- Day $1$, Operator $1$: $0.097$, $0.099$, $0.098$.\n- Day $1$, Operator $2$: $0.102$, $0.101$, $0.103$.\n- Day $2$, Operator $1$: $0.095$, $0.096$, $0.094$.\n- Day $2$, Operator $2$: $0.101$, $0.100$, $0.102$.\n- Day $3$, Operator $1$: $0.098$, $0.097$, $0.099$.\n- Day $3$, Operator $2$: $0.104$, $0.105$, $0.103$.\n\nAssume a two-way crossed random-effects model with interaction for the sources of variation: day, operator, day-by-operator interaction, and residual. Using only well-tested statistical foundations (balanced two-way random-effects analysis of variance and variance-component estimation via expected mean squares), compute the intermediate precision coefficient of variation defined as $CV = \\sigma_{\\text{IP}} / \\mu$, where $\\sigma_{\\text{IP}}$ is the intermediate precision standard deviation obtained by summing the estimated variance components and taking the square root, and $\\mu$ is the grand mean of all $18$ measurements.\n\nRound your final CV to four significant figures.

The validation focuses on the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) metric. The Limit of Blank (LoB) is defined as the upper bound of the blank measurement distribution at one-sided confidence level $0.95$, and the Limit of Detection (LoD) is defined as the minimum analyte level for which the assay’s signal is expected to exceed the LoB with one-sided confidence level $0.95$, under the assumptions that replicate measurements at low signal levels are independent and approximately Gaussian with constant variance within the low range.\n\nYou are provided with replicate VAF measurements for a negative control (blank) and a low-level positive sample (both processed across multiple runs with identical workflow).

For a measurement $X_L \\sim N(\\mu_{LoD}, \\sigma_L^2)$, we have $P(X_L > \\text{LoB}) = 0.95$.

The variant allele fraction (VAF) from the reference method is denoted by $A_i$ and from the new method by $B_i$ for each specimen $i$.\n\nFirst, for each specimen pair, we define the difference $d_i = B_i - A_i$ and the mean of the two measurements $m_i = (A_i + B_i)/2$. These values are calculated from the provided data:\n- Specimen $1$: $A_1=0.105$, $B_1=0.095 \\implies d_1 = -0.010$, $m_1 = 0.100$\n- Specimen $2$: $A_2=0.200$, $B_2=0.200 \\implies d_2 = 0.000$, $m_2 = 0.200$\n- Specimen $3$: $A_3=0.295$, $B_3=0.305 \\implies d_3 = 0.010$, $m_3 = 0.300$\n- Specimen $4$: $A_4=0.390$, $B_4=0.410 \\implies d_4 = 0.020$, $m_4 = 0.400$\n- Specimen $5$: $A_5=0.485$, $B_5=0.515 \\implies d_5 = 0.030$, $m_5 = 0.500$\n- Specimen $6$: $A_6=0.580$, $B_6=0.620 \\implies d_6 = 0.040$, $m_6 = 0.600$\n- Specimen $7$: $A_7=0.675$, $B_7=0.725 \\implies d_7 = 0.050$, $m_7 = 0.700$\n- Specimen $8$: $A_8=0.770$, $B_8=0.830 \\implies d_8 = 0.060$, $m_8 = 0.800$\n\n**1) Calculation of Mean and Standard Deviation of Differences**\n\nThe sample mean difference, $\\bar{d}$, is the average of the individual differences $d_i$. This value represents the estimated constant or systematic bias between the two methods.\n$$\n\\bar{d} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( -0.010 + 0.000 + 0.010 + 0.020 + 0.030 + 0.040 + 0.050 + 0.060 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{d} = \\frac{0.200}{8} = 0.025\n$$\nThe sample standard deviation of the differences, $s_d$, quantifies the random error or variability of the differences around the mean difference.\n$$\ns_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (d_i - \\bar{d})^2}\n$$\nThe sum of squared deviations from the mean difference is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} (d_i - \\bar{d})^2 = (-0.010-0.025)^2 + (0.000-0.025)^2 + (0.010-0.025)^2 + (0.020-0.025)^2 + (0.030-0.025)^2 + (0.040-0.025)^2 + (0.050-0.025)^2 + (0.060-0.025)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} (d_i - \\bar{d})^2 = (-0.035)^2 + (-0.025)^2 + (-0.015)^2 + (-0.005)^2 + (0.005)^2 + (0.015)^2 + (0.025)^2 + (0.035)^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{8} (d_i - \\bar{d})^2 = 0.001225 + 0.000625 + 0.000225 + 0.000025 + 0.000025 + 0.000225 + 0.000625 + 0.001225 = 0.0042\n$$\nNow, we calculate $s_d$:\n$$\ns_d = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0042}{8-1}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0042}{7}} = \\sqrt{0.0006} \\approx 0.024495\n$$\n\n**2) Construction of the Limits of Agreement**\n\nThe $95\\%$ limits of agreement provide an interval within which approximately $95\\%$ of future differences between the two methods are expected to lie. As directed, we use the standard normal quantile. Symbolically, the limits are:\n$$\n\\bar{d} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot s_d\n$$\nFor a $95\\%$ coverage interval, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha=0.05$. The required quantile is $z_{0.975}$, which is commonly known to be approximately $1.96$.\nThe limits are therefore $\\bar{d} \\pm 1.96 s_d$.\nNumerically, this is:\n$$\n0.025 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.0006} \\approx 0.025 \\pm 1.96 \\cdot 0.024495 \\approx 0.025 \\pm 0.04801\n$$\nLower Limit of Agreement $\\approx -0.02301$\nUpper Limit of Agreement $\\approx 0.07301$\n\n**3) Evaluation of Proportional Bias**\n\nProportional bias exists if the difference between methods ($d_i$) is dependent on the magnitude of the measurement ($m_i$). This is evaluated by fitting an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model of the form $d_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 m_i + \\epsilon_i$. The slope parameter $\\beta_1$ quantifies the proportional bias. The problem asks for the OLS estimate of the slope, $\\hat{\\beta}_1$, derived from its definition in terms of centered sums:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (m_i - \\bar{m})(d_i - \\bar{d})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (m_i - \\bar{m})^2}\n$$\nFirst, we need the sample mean of the measurement averages, $\\bar{m}$:\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( 0.100 + 0.200 + 0.300 + 0.400 + 0.500 + 0.600 + 0.700 + 0.800 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{m} = \\frac{3.600}{8} = 0.450\n$$\nNext, we calculate the numerator, the sum of cross-products of centered variables, $S_{md}$:\n$$\nS_{md} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (m_i - \\bar{m})(d_i - \\bar{d})\n$$\n$$\nS_{md} = (0.100 - 0.450)(-0.010 - 0.025) + \\dots + (0.800 - 0.450)(0.060 - 0.025)\n$$\n$$\nS_{md} = (-0.350)(-0.035) + (-0.250)(-0.025) + (-0.150)(-0.015) + (-0.050)(-0.005) + (0.050)(0.005) + (0.150)(0.015) + (0.250)(0.025) + (0.350)(0.035)\n$$\n$$\nS_{md} = 0.01225 + 0.00625 + 0.00225 + 0.00025 + 0.00025 + 0.00225 + 0.00625 + 0.01225 = 0.042\n$$\nThen, we calculate the denominator, the sum of squared deviations of $m_i$, $S_{mm}$:\n$$\nS_{mm} = \\sum_{i=1}^{8} (m_i - \\bar{m})^2\n$$\n$$\nS_{mm} = (-0.350)^2 + (-0.250)^2 + (-0.150)^2 + (-0.050)^2 + (0.050)^2 + (0.150)^2 + (0.250)^2 + (0.350)^2\n$$\n$$\nS_{mm} = 0.1225 + 0.0625 + 0.0225 + 0.0025 + 0.0025 + 0.0225 + 0.0625 + 0.1225 = 0.420\n$$\nFinally, we compute $\\hat{\\beta}_1$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_1 = \\frac{S_{md}}{S_{mm}} = \\frac{0.042}{0.420} = 0.1\n$$\nA non-zero slope suggests the presence of proportional bias. The positive sign of $\\hat{\\beta}_1=0.1$ indicates that as the VAF increases, the new method ($B$) tends to report increasingly higher values compared to the reference method ($A$).\n\nThe problem requires the numerical value of $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is exactly $0.1$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.1000$.",
