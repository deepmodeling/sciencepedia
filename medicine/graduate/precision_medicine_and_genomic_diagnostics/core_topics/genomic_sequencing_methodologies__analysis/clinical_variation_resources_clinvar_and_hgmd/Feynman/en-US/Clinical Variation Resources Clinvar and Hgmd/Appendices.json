This practice focuses on the fundamental principles of variant normalization, specifically how to represent insertions and deletions (indels) that occur in repetitive DNA sequences. Mastering these rules of left alignment and minimal representation is crucial for ensuring data integrity and preventing interpretation errors that can arise from inconsistent variant descriptions .",

            "problem": "You are standardizing a trio of small insertions and deletions (indels) observed in a homopolymer tract for cross-resource matching between ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Consistent normalization enables unambiguous mapping of submissions across resources. Use the following foundational bases:\n\n- Variant Call Format (VCF) (Variant Call Format) represents indels using an anchor base: the reference allele includes one left-flanking base at the variant position, and the alternate allele includes that same left-flanking base plus the inserted sequence for insertions or excludes the deleted sequence for deletions.\n- Left alignment moves an indel within a repetitive context to the smallest possible coordinate while preserving the same haplotype change under the reference genome, by sliding the variant left within identical repeat units.\n- Minimal representation trims all shared leading and trailing sequence between the reference and alternate alleles so that the $(\\text{REF}, \\text{ALT})$ pair is the shortest possible while still encoding the same change.\n\nAssume $1$-based genomic coordinates and the following reference substring spanning a homopolymer tract:\n\n- At coordinate $2000$ the base is $T$.\n- At coordinates $2001$ through $2009$ the bases are all $A$ (a homopolymer run of $A$).\n- Bases outside this window need not be used.\n\nThree observed indels, described in Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) notation relative to this reference, are:\n\n- $V_{1}$: $g.2005\\_2006insA$ (an insertion of $A$ between positions $2005$ and $2006$).\n- $V_{2}$: $g.2006\\_2007delAA$ (a deletion of $AA$ spanning positions $2006$ to $2007$).\n- $V_{3}$: $g.2003\\_2005delAAA$ (a deletion of $AAA$ spanning positions $2003$ to $2005$).\n\nApply left alignment and minimal representation under the VCF convention to derive the unique normalized $(\\text{POS}, \\text{REF}, \\text{ALT})$ triple for each $V_{i}$. Let $p_{i}$ denote the normalized position (the VCF $\\text{POS}$ coordinate) of $V_{i}$ after normalization. Compute the sum $S = p_{1} + p_{2} + p_{3}$. Express your final answer for $S$ as an exact integer with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the normalization of three indel variants ($V_1$, $V_2$, $V_3$) according to VCF conventions, which include left alignment and minimal representation with an anchor base. The goal is to find the normalized VCF position ($p_i$) for each variant and compute their sum, $S = p_1 + p_2 + p_3$.\n\nThe relevant reference sequence is a $T$ at position 2000 followed by a run of nine $A$'s from 2001 to 2009.\nPosition: $... 2000 \\ 2001 \\ 2002 \\ 2003 \\ 2004 \\ 2005 \\ 2006 \\ 2007 \\ 2008 \\ 2009 ...$\nBase:     $... \\ \\ T \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ A \\ ...$\n\nThe core principle of left alignment is to shift an indel to the left-most possible position within a repetitive context. For all three variants, which occur within the poly-$A$ tract, this means shifting them to the start of the tract, which is at position 2001. The canonical VCF representation then uses the preceding base at position 2000 as an anchor.\n\n### Variant $V_1$: $g.2005\\_2006insA$\nThis is an insertion of an $A$ into the poly-$A$ tract.\n1.  **Left Alignment**: The insertion is shifted to the left-most possible position, which is between coordinates 2000 and 2001.\n2.  **VCF Representation**: To represent an insertion of 'A' after position 2000, we use the base at position 2000 ('T') as an anchor.\n    - Position (POS) becomes 2000.\n    - The Reference allele (REF) is the anchor base: `T`.\n    - The Alternate allele (ALT) is the anchor base plus the insertion: `TA`.\n    - The normalized VCF representation is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=T, \\text{ALT}=TA)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_1 = 2000$.\n\n### Variant $V_2$: $g.2006\\_2007delAA$\nThis is a deletion of two $A$'s from the poly-$A$ tract.\n1.  **Left Alignment**: The deletion of `AA` is shifted to the left-most position, deleting the bases at coordinates 2001 and 2002.\n2.  **VCF Representation**: To represent a deletion starting at position 2001, we use the base at position 2000 ('T') as an anchor.\n    - Position (POS) becomes 2000.\n    - The REF allele is the anchor base plus the deleted sequence: `TAA`.\n    - The ALT allele is just the anchor base: `T`.\n    - The normalized VCF representation is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=TAA, \\text{ALT}=T)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_2 = 2000$.\n\n### Variant $V_3$: $g.2003\\_2005delAAA$\nThis is a deletion of three $A$'s from the poly-$A$ tract.\n1.  **Left Alignment**: The deletion of `AAA` is shifted left to delete the bases at coordinates 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n2.  **VCF Representation**: We again use the base at position 2000 ('T') as an anchor.\n    - Position (POS) becomes 2000.\n    - The REF allele is the anchor base plus the deleted sequence: `TAAA`.\n    - The ALT allele is the anchor base: `T`.\n    - The normalized VCF representation is $(\\text{POS}=2000, \\text{REF}=TAAA, \\text{ALT}=T)$.\n    - The normalized position is $p_3 = 2000$.\n\n### Calculation of the Sum\nAll three indels, when normalized according to VCF conventions, are anchored to the base at position 2000. Thus, the normalized VCF position for all three variants is 2000.\n\n$p_1 = 2000$\n$p_2 = 2000$\n$p_3 = 2000$\n\nThe sum $S$ is computed as:\n$$S = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 2000 + 2000 + 2000 = 6000$$",

This exercise bridges the gap between the genomic context (as seen in a VCF file) and the transcript-specific context by applying Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) nomenclature rules, including the essential \"3'-rule\" for repetitive sequences. By working through a scenario with two alternative transcripts, you will develop the skill to accurately describe a variant's effect on the coding sequence and protein, a process fundamental to clinical reporting .",

            "problem": "A laboratory performing clinical genomic diagnostics observes that normalized variant descriptions are required for accurate cross-resource querying in the Clinical Variation resource (ClinVar) and the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). You are provided a Variant Call Format (VCF) record for a protein-coding gene on chromosome $7$ on the positive strand. The gene has two clinically used transcripts that differ by their start codons. Transcript $\\mathrm{T1}$ initiates its coding DNA sequence (CDS) at genomic coordinate $7{:}1{,}000{,}000$, and transcript $\\mathrm{T2}$ initiates its CDS at genomic coordinate $7{:}999{,}970$. Both transcripts share the same downstream exons and coding sequence after the start, but their $5'$ coding segments differ because $\\mathrm{T2}$ has an upstream start codon.\n\nThe local reference coding DNA for transcript $\\mathrm{T1}$ in the region $c.$ positions $300$ to $312$ is as follows: the base at $c.300$ is the cytosine immediately preceding a homopolymeric tract of four consecutive codons encoding glutamate (\"GAA\"), i.e., $c.301\\text{–}c.303 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, $c.304\\text{–}c.306 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, $c.307\\text{–}c.309 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$, and $c.310\\text{–}c.312 = \\text{\"GAA\"}$. The gene is on the positive strand, and introns are not present in this local region. The provided VCF record is left-aligned with respect to this repeat and reads: chrom $7$, position $1{,}000{,}299$, REF = \"CGAA\", ALT = \"C\". This represents a deletion of the triplet \"GAA\" immediately following the preceding base \"C\" in the earliest (leftmost) possible repeat unit in VCF.\n\nYou must produce correct Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) $c.$ and $p.$ notations for both $\\mathrm{T1}$ and $\\mathrm{T2}$, adhering to the HGVS \"3'-rule\" for repetitive sequences. Use the following fundamental bases and well-tested facts:\n- The Central Dogma states that protein-coding sequences are translated in triplet codons, with each codon comprising $3$ nucleotides.\n- Coding DNA numbering for HGVS $c.$ notation begins at the \"A\" of the first \"ATG\" start codon as $c.1$, increases by $1$ for each nucleotide in the coding sequence, and maps $c.1\\text{–}c.3$ to amino acid position $1$, $c.4\\text{–}c.6$ to amino acid position $2$, and so on.\n- The HGVS \"3'-rule\" requires that variants in repetitive sequences be described at the most $3'$ position in the given coordinate system; for a positive-strand gene, this corresponds to the highest possible $c.$ coordinates within the repeat.\n- The standard genetic code maps \"GAA\" to glutamate (Glu, \"E\").\n\nAfter you convert the VCF indel to the correct HGVS $c.$ and $p.$ notations for both transcripts, compute the absolute difference between the amino acid positions indicated by the two resulting $p.$ notations. Express your final answer as a pure number with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The solution requires converting the VCF record to HGVS notation for two transcripts, T1 and T2, applying the 3'-rule, and then calculating the difference in the affected amino acid positions.\n\n### Analysis for Transcript T1\nFirst, we map the VCF variant to the coding sequence of transcript T1. The T1 CDS starts at genomic position $1{,}000{,}000$. The VCF record (`POS: 1,000,299, REF: CGAA, ALT: C`) describes a deletion of \"GAA\" at genomic positions $1{,}000{,}300\\text{–}1{,}000{,}302$. The mapping from genomic coordinate $g$ to coding coordinate $c$ for T1 is $c = g - 1{,}000{,}000 + 1$.\n- The deleted genomic region $1{,}000{,}300\\text{–}1{,}000{,}302$ corresponds to coding positions $c.301\\text{–}c.303$.\n- The left-aligned description is `c.301_303del`.\n\nNext, we apply the HGVS 3'-rule. The variant is in a repetitive tract of four \"GAA\" codons spanning `c.301` to `c.312`. The rule requires shifting the description to the most 3' position.\n- The last \"GAA\" unit is at positions `c.310_c.312`.\n- The correct, normalized HGVS notation for T1 is `c.310_c.312del`.\n\nFinally, we determine the protein-level (`p.`) notation. The amino acid position $p$ for a codon starting at nucleotide $c_{start}$ is $p = \\lceil c_{start} / 3 \\rceil$.\n- For the deletion at `c.310`, the amino acid position is $p_1 = \\lceil 310 / 3 \\rceil = 104$.\n- The codon \"GAA\" encodes Glutamate (Glu), so the notation is `p.Glu104del`. The position for T1 is $p_1 = 104$.\n\n### Analysis for Transcript T2\nThe CDS for transcript T2 starts 30 bp upstream of T1, at genomic position $999{,}970$. This means for any genomic position, the coding coordinate in T2 is 30 greater than in T1 ($c_{\\mathrm{T2}} = c_{\\mathrm{T1}} + 30$).\n- The normalized deletion in T1, `c.310_c.312del`, corresponds to `c.(310+30)_(312+30)del` in T2.\n- The HGVS notation for T2 is `c.340_c.342del`.\n\nNow we find the protein position for T2:\n- $p_2 = \\lceil 340 / 3 \\rceil = 114$.\n- The notation is `p.Glu114del`. The position for T2 is $p_2 = 114$.\n\n### Final Calculation\nThe problem asks for the absolute difference between the two amino acid positions:\n$$ |p_2 - p_1| = |114 - 104| = 10 $$\nThe difference is 10.",
