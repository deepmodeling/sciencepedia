This practice demonstrates the application of the widely used Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) activity score system, a standardized method for classifying metabolic phenotype from a given diplotype.

            "problem": "A patient undergoing genotype-guided therapy has a cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) diplotype characterized by one normal function allele (e.g., `*1`) present in a single copy and one decreased function allele (e.g., `*41`) present in a duplicated state (two copies on one homologous chromosome, denoted `*41x2`). In this setting, assume the following foundational facts and definitions that are widely used in precision medicine:\n\n- By the Central Dogma of molecular biology and gene dosage principles, the total enzyme activity contributed by a gene is proportional to the number of functional gene copies and the per-copy functional capacity, and contributions from distinct alleles add.\n- The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) defines allele function categories for CYP2D6 such that a normal function allele contributes a per-copy activity value of $1$, a decreased function allele contributes a per-copy activity value of $\\frac{1}{2}$, and a no function allele contributes $0$.\n- For phenotype interpretation, CPIC maps the CYP2D6 activity score to metabolizer categories using widely accepted thresholds: poor metabolizer if $AS = 0$, intermediate metabolizer if $AS \\in [0.25, 1.0]$, normal metabolizer if $AS \\in [1.25, 2.25]$, and ultrarapid metabolizer if $AS > 2.25$.\n\nLet $n_{N}$ denote the number of copies of the normal function allele and $n_{D}$ denote the number of copies of the decreased function allele in this diplotype.

It utilizes the standardized CYP2D6 activity score system developed and maintained by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC). This system is a cornerstone of genotype-guided drug therapy in clinical practice. The concepts of allele function, gene dosage, diplotype, and phenotype classification are fundamental principles of pharmacogenomics.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to compute a unique activity score: the specific alleles in the diplotype, the number of copies of each allele, and the standardized activity value assigned to each allele function type. The criteria for phenotype classification are explicitly defined and non-overlapping for the calculated score.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is objective. It uses precise, standard terminology from the field of clinical genetics and pharmacogenomics. The definitions and values are taken directly from established clinical guidelines, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, and non-trivial. It is a direct application of a standard clinical algorithm.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total CYP2D6 activity score, denoted $AS$, is calculated as the sum of the activity values of all alleles present in the patient's diplotype. The activity contribution of a set of identical alleles is the product of the number of copies of that allele and its assigned per-copy activity value.\n\nLet $v_N$, $v_D$, and $v_0$ be the per-copy activity values for normal, decreased, and no function alleles, respectively. From the givens, we have:\n-   $v_N = 1$\n-   $v_D = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $v_0 = 0$\n\nThe general formula for the activity score based on the number of copies of each allele type ($n_N$, $n_D$, $n_0$) is:\n$$AS = n_N \\cdot v_N + n_D \\cdot v_D + n_0 \\cdot v_0$$\n\nFrom the problem description of the patient's diplotype:\n-   There is \"one normal function allele (`*1`) present in a single copy\". This gives $n_N = 1$.\n-   There is \"one decreased function allele (`*41`) present in a duplicated state (two copies on one homologous chromosome, denoted `*41x2`)\". This means the total number of copies of the decreased function allele is $2$. This gives $n_D = 2$.\n-   There are no \"no function\" alleles mentioned in the diplotype. This gives $n_0 = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the activity score formula:\n$$AS = (1) \\cdot (1) + (2) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (0) \\cdot (0)$$\n$$AS = 1 + 1 + 0$$\n$$AS = 2$$\n\nThe calculated activity score is $AS = 2$.\n\nNext, we classify the metabolizer phenotype using the provided CPIC thresholds:\n-   Poor metabolizer: $AS = 0$\n-   Intermediate metabolizer: $AS \\in [0.25, 1.0]$\n-   Normal metabolizer: $AS \\in [1.25, 2.25]$\n-   Ultrarapid metabolizer: $AS > 2.25$\n\nSince our calculated score is $AS = 2$, and $2$ falls within the interval $[1.25, 2.25]$, the patient's predicted CYP2D6 metabolizer phenotype is **Normal Metabolizer**.\n\nThe problem asks for the activity score $AS$ in the final answer.\nThe computed CYP2D6 activity score is $2$.",
