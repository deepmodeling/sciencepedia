A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet the three genotypes be denoted by the index $g$, where $g \\in \\{*1/*1, *1/*28, *28/*28\\}$. The problem provides the relative UGT1A1 activities, which we will denote as $A(g)$.\nThe given values are:\n- $A(*1/*1) = 1.0$\n- $A(*1/*28) = 0.7$\n- $A(*28/*28) = 0.3$\n\n**Part 1: Ratios of Intrinsic Clearance ($CL_{\\text{int}}$)**\n\nThe problem states that the in vitro relative UGT1A1 activities are proportional to the intrinsic clearance, $CL_{\\text{int}}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$CL_{\\text{int}}(g) \\propto A(g)$$\nThis implies that there exists a constant of proportionality, $k$, such that $CL_{\\text{int}}(g) = k \\cdot A(g)$.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratios of $CL_{\\text{int}}$ for each genotype, normalized to the wild-type ($*1/*1$) genotype. The ratio for a given genotype $g$ is:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(g) = \\frac{CL_{\\text{int}}(g)}{CL_{\\text{int}}(*1/*1)}$$\nSubstituting the proportionality:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(g) = \\frac{k \\cdot A(g)}{k \\cdot A(*1/*1)} = \\frac{A(g)}{A(*1/*1)}$$\nSince $A(*1/*1) = 1.0$, the ratios are simply the activity values themselves.\n\nFor the $*1/*1$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(*1/*1) = \\frac{A(*1/*1)}{A(*1/*1)} = \\frac{1.0}{1.0} = 1.0$$\nFor the $*1/*28$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(*1/*28) = \\frac{A(*1/*28)}{A(*1/*1)} = \\frac{0.7}{1.0} = 0.7$$\nFor the $*28/*28$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(*28/*28) = \\frac{A(*28/*28)}{A(*1/*1)} = \\frac{0.3}{1.0} = 0.3$$\n\nThe set of $CL_{\\text{int}}$ ratios for ($*1/*1, *1/*28, *28/*28$) is ($1.0, 0.7, 0.3$).\n\n**Part 2: Ratios of SN-38 Area Under the Curve ($\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}$)**\n\nThe problem states that for a single dose, the area under the curve is inversely proportional to the systemic clearance, $CL$:\n$$\\text{AUC} \\propto \\frac{1}{CL}$$\nSince SN-38 elimination is dominated by hepatic clearance via UGT1A1, we can approximate the systemic clearance $CL$ with the hepatic clearance $CL_h$.\n$$\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}} \\propto \\frac{1}{CL_h}$$\nThe problem further specifies that the system is under the low-extraction regime, meaning $f_{u}\\,CL_{\\text{int}}\\ll Q_{h}$.

Therefore, for the purpose of comparing genotypes, $f_u$ is a constant. The relationship simplifies to:\n$$\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}(g) \\propto \\frac{1}{CL_{\\text{int}}(g)}$$\nThis shows that the AUC for SN-38 is inversely proportional to its intrinsic clearance.\n\nWe need to find the ratios of $\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}$ for each genotype, normalized to the wild-type ($*1/*1$) genotype. The ratio for a given genotype $g$ is:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{\\text{AUC}}(g) = \\frac{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}(g)}{\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}(*1/*1)}$$\nUsing the inverse proportionality:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{\\text{AUC}}(g) = \\frac{1/CL_{\\text{int}}(g)}{1/CL_{\\text{int}}(*1/*1)} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{int}}(*1/*1)}{CL_{\\text{int}}(g)} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Ratio}_{CL_{\\text{int}}}(g)}$$\nThe AUC ratios are the reciprocals of the $CL_{\\text{int}}$ ratios calculated in Part 1.\n\nFor the $*1/*1$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{\\text{AUC}}(*1/*1) = \\frac{1}{1.0} = 1.0$$\nFor the $*1/*28$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{\\text{AUC}}(*1/*28) = \\frac{1}{0.7} \\approx 1.42857...$$\nFor the $*28/*28$ genotype:\n$$\\text{Ratio}_{\\text{AUC}}(*28/*28) = \\frac{1}{0.3} \\approx 3.33333...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding these AUC ratios to four significant figures.\n- Ratio for $*1/*1$: $1.000$\n- Ratio for $*1/*28$: $1.429$\n- Ratio for $*28/*28$: $3.333$\n\nThe set of $\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}$ ratios for ($*1/*1, *1/*28, *28/*28$) is ($1.000, 1.429, 3.333$).\n\n**Final Assembly**\nThe requested final answer is a single row matrix containing the six ratios in the specified order: the three $CL_{\\text{int}}$ ratios followed by the three corresponding $\\text{AUC}_{\\text{SN-38}}$ ratios.\nThe values are: ($1.0, 0.7, 0.3, 1.000, 1.429, 3.333$).",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacokinetics and enzyme kinetics, is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe area under the plasma concentration-time curve ($AUC$) is fundamentally related to the total amount of a substance that enters systemic circulation, which can be denoted as the effective dose $A$, and its total body clearance, $CL$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ AUC = \\frac{A}{CL} $$\nThe problem states that the formation rate of the metabolite SN-38 from irinotecan is unchanged across the scenarios being compared. This implies that the total amount of SN-38 formed and entering the systemic circulation, $A$, is constant. Consequently, the $AUC$ is inversely proportional to the clearance, $CL$:\n$$ AUC \\propto \\frac{1}{CL} $$\nThe ratio of the $AUC$ in the modified condition (with the specified genotype and inhibitor), which we will denote as $AUC_{\\text{mod}}$, to the $AUC$ in the baseline condition (wild-type, no inhibitor), denoted as $AUC_{\\text{base}}$, is therefore the inverse ratio of their respective clearances, $CL_{\\text{mod}}$ and $CL_{\\text{base}}$:\n$$ \\frac{AUC_{\\text{mod}}}{AUC_{\\text{base}}} = \\frac{CL_{\\text{base}}}{CL_{\\text{mod}}} $$\nThe problem states that the elimination of SN-38 is dominated by UGT1A1-mediated glucuronidation, which follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The rate of elimination, $v$, is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation:\n$$ v = \\frac{V_{\\max} \\cdot C}{K_m + C} $$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration of SN-38, $V_{\\max}$ is the maximum enzymatic velocity, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.\n\nA critical condition provided is that the SN-38 concentration $C$ is much less than $K_m$, expressed as $C \\ll K_m$. This condition simplifies the denominator of the rate equation to $K_m + C \\approx K_m$. Under this assumption, the elimination kinetics are approximately first-order with respect to the substrate concentration:\n$$ v \\approx \\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}\\right) C $$\nClearance ($CL$) is defined as the rate of elimination per unit of drug concentration, $CL = \\frac{v}{C}$. Using the simplified rate equation derived from the problem's assumption, the clearance becomes:\n$$ CL \\approx \\frac{\\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}\\right) C}{C} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m} $$\nThis expression, $\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_m}$, represents the intrinsic clearance ($CL_{\\text{int}}$) of the enzyme. The problem's assumptions (negligible other pathways, non-limiting hepatic blood flow) allow us to equate the total body clearance $CL$ with this intrinsic clearance.\n\nLet us define the parameters for the baseline and modified states.\nFor the baseline (wild-type, no inhibitor) state, the clearance is:\n$$ CL_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{base}}}{K_{m, \\text{base}}} $$\nFor the modified (genotype + inhibitor) state, the problem states that $K_m$ is unaffected, so $K_{m, \\text{mod}} = K_{m, \\text{base}}$. The maximum velocity $V_{\\max}$ is altered by two factors:\n1.  A UGT1A1 genotype reduces $V_{\\max}$ by $40\\%$. This corresponds to a remaining activity factor of $1 - 0.40 = 0.60$.\n2.  A co-administered medication acts as a UGT1A1 inhibitor, reducing catalytic capacity by an additional $30\\%$. This corresponds to a remaining activity factor of $1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n\nThe problem specifies that these two effects combine multiplicatively. Therefore, the maximum velocity in the modified state, $V_{\\max, \\text{mod}}$, is:\n$$ V_{\\max, \\text{mod}} = V_{\\max, \\text{base}} \\times (1 - 0.40) \\times (1 - 0.30) $$\n$$ V_{\\max, \\text{mod}} = V_{\\max, \\text{base}} \\times 0.60 \\times 0.70 $$\n$$ V_{\\max, \\text{mod}} = 0.42 \\cdot V_{\\max, \\text{base}} $$\nNow, we can write the expression for the clearance in the modified state:\n$$ CL_{\\text{mod}} = \\frac{V_{\\max, \\text{mod}}}{K_{m, \\text{mod}}} = \\frac{0.42 \\cdot V_{\\max, \\text{base}}}{K_{m, \\text{base}}} = 0.42 \\cdot CL_{\\text{base}} $$\nFinally, we can substitute this result into the equation for the $AUC$ ratio.

The patient’s genotype at the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase family 1 member A1 (UGT1A1) locus is heterozygous UGT1A1*1/UGT1A1*28 (often written as *1/*28). The question is whether a preemptive dose reduction is warranted at a low-dose irinotecan regimen.\n\nUse the following foundational facts and definitions:\n- Irinotecan is converted to the active metabolite SN-38; SN-38 is cleared predominantly via glucuronidation by UGT1A1. For a given patient and regimen, the area under the concentration–time curve (AUC) for SN-38, denoted $A$, scales approximately as $A \\propto D/CL$, where $D$ is the irinotecan dose (in mg/m$^2$) and $CL$ is the effective metabolic clearance for SN-38 mediated by UGT1A1.\n- The UGT1A1*28 promoter variant reduces UGT1A1 expression; in heterozygotes (*1/*28), the reduction in $CL$ relative to wild-type (*1/*1) is modest (commonly approximated as a fractional decrease of about $20\\%$ to $30\\%$ in population averages).\n- Exposure–response observations for irinotecan regimens indicate a steep increase in the probability of grade 3–4 neutropenia once a normalized exposure crosses a threshold. Define the normalized exposure as\n$$\nE \\equiv \\frac{D/CL}{D_{\\mathrm{ref}}/CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}},\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 180 \\text{ mg/m}^2$ and $CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ is the typical wild-type clearance.

At $D = 120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, the increase in $A$ due to the *1/*28-associated reduction in $CL$ leaves $E$ below the steep-risk threshold $E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$, and pooled low-dose clinical data show comparable grade 3–4 neutropenia rates in *1/*28 versus *1/*1, supporting no dose reduction.\n\nB. Any reduction in UGT1A1 activity in *1/*28 inevitably pushes $E$ above $E^{\\star}$ regardless of dose, so dose reduction is always warranted.\n\nC. No dose reduction is warranted in *1/*28 specifically when baseline bilirubin is elevated, because lower hepatic function reduces irinotecan bioactivation and thereby offsets SN-38 accumulation.\n\nD. Dose reduction is unnecessary only when co-administering strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, because they prevent formation of SN-38 from irinotecan, lowering exposure in *1/*28 patients.\n\nE.

The problem specifies to use the approximation $CL_{\\mathrm{HZ}} \\approx 0.8 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n*   Reference dose: $D_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 180 \\text{ mg/m}^2$.\n*   Reference clearance: $CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $E$:\n$$ E = \\frac{(120 \\text{ mg/m}^2) / (0.8 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{WT}})}{(180 \\text{ mg/m}^2) / CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}} $$\nThe terms $CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and the units $\\text{mg/m}^2$ cancel out:\n$$ E = \\frac{120 / 0.8}{180} = \\frac{150}{180} = \\frac{15}{18} = \\frac{5}{6} $$\nThe calculated normalized exposure is $E \\approx 0.833$.\n\nThis result, $E \\approx 0.833$, is less than the critical toxicity threshold of $E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$. This calculation, based on the provided mechanistic model, suggests that a typical heterozygous patient receiving this low dose of irinotecan is not expected to have an exposure level that places them in the steep-risk region for neutropenia.\n\nNext, we must consider the provided clinical evidence. The problem states that for low-dose regimens (defined as $D \\leq 150 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, which includes our proposed dose of $D=120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$), pooled data show similar rates of grade 3–4 neutropenia in wild-type (*1/*1) versus heterozygous (*1/*28) patients (e.g., $9\\%$ vs. $10\\%$). This empirical observation directly supports the conclusion from our calculation: at low doses, the moderate increase in SN-38 exposure in heterozygotes is not sufficient to cause a clinically significant increase in severe toxicity across the patient population.\n\nIn contrast, at high doses ($D \\geq 180 \\text{ mg/m}^2$), the risk is substantially higher for heterozygotes ($10\\%$ vs. $22\\%$). This is also consistent with the model. For a heterozygote at $D = 180 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, the exposure would be $E = \\frac{180 / (0.8 \\cdot CL_{\\mathrm{WT}})}{180 / CL_{\\mathrm{WT}}} = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25$. This value of $1.25$ is greater than $E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$, predicting the observed increase in toxicity.\n\nTherefore, the justification for not implementing a preemptive dose reduction at $D = 120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$ is a combination of two consistent lines of reasoning:\n1.  The calculated average normalized exposure ($E \\approx 0.833$) falls below the critical toxicity threshold ($E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$).\n2.  Empirical clinical data from low-dose regimens confirm that there is no significant difference in severe toxicity rates between the genotypes.\n\nThe mention of a high coefficient of variation ($40\\%$) in clearance acknowledges that some individuals may deviate significantly from the average. However, the decision on *preemptive* dose reduction is a population-level strategy based on the expected outcome for a patient with a given genotype, and the average outcome does not support a dose reduction in this case.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. At $D = 120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, the increase in $A$ due to the *1/*28-associated reduction in $CL$ leaves $E$ below the steep-risk threshold $E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$, and pooled low-dose clinical data show comparable grade 3–4 neutropenia rates in *1/*28 versus *1/*1, supporting no dose reduction.**\nThis option correctly synthesizes both pillars of the argument derived above. It acknowledges the reduced clearance, correctly states that the resulting normalized exposure $E$ remains below the threshold of $\\approx 1.0$ at the specified dose of $120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, and cites the corroborating clinical evidence of comparable toxicity rates at low doses. This is a complete and accurate justification based on the information provided.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Any reduction in UGT1A1 activity in *1/*28 inevitably pushes $E$ above $E^{\\star}$ regardless of dose, so dose reduction is always warranted.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The normalized exposure $E$ is proportional to the dose $D$. As calculated, for $D = 120 \\text{ mg/m}^2$, the exposure $E \\approx 0.833$, which is below the threshold $E^{\\star} \\approx 1.0$. The claim that $E$ is *inevitably* pushed above the threshold *regardless of dose* is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. No dose reduction is warranted in *1/*28 specifically when baseline bilirubin is elevated, because lower hepatic function reduces irinotecan bioactivation and thereby offsets SN-38 accumulation.**\nThis option introduces information not present in the problem statement (baseline bilirubin). Furthermore, its pharmacological reasoning is flawed. Elevated bilirubin is often a functional marker for *decreased* UGT1A1 activity, which would argue for *increased* risk, not less. Moreover, significant hepatic impairment generally increases, rather than decreases, the risk of irinotecan toxicity due to reduced clearance of SN-38, often outweighing any potential reduction in bioactivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Dose reduction is unnecessary only when co-administering strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, because they prevent formation of SN-38 from irinotecan, lowering exposure in *1/*28 patients.**\nThis statement is based on a fundamental error in pharmacology. Irinotecan is primarily activated to SN-38 by carboxylesterases, not CYP3A4. CYP3A4 is mainly involved in an alternate, *inactivating* pathway. Therefore, inhibiting CYP3A4 would block this inactivation route, leading to *more* irinotecan being shunted to the activation pathway, thus *increasing* SN-38 levels and toxicity. The logic is the exact opposite of established metabolic interactions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. No dose reduction is warranted whenever therapeutic drug monitoring is unavailable, because dose individualization requires both genotype and real-time exposure data.**\nThis presents a logical fallacy (a non sequitur). The availability of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is irrelevant to the question of whether a *preemptive*, genotype-based dose adjustment is warranted. In the absence of TDM, genotype is one of the primary tools used for preemptive dose individualization. The argument that the lack of one tool (TDM) invalidates the use of another (genotyping) is illogical. The decision to make a preemptive adjustment is based on the risk-benefit analysis for the average patient with that genotype, which is precisely what the provided data allow us to assess.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
