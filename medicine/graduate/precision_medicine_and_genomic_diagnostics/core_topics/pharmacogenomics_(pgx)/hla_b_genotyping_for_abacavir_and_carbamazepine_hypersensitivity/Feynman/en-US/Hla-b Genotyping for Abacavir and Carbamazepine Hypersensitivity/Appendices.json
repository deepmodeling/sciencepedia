The exercise delves into the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), a core principle, and examines why this model can fail in admixed populations—a phenomenon known as the Wahlund effect.

            "problem": "In pharmacogenomic implementation for abacavir, genotyping Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B*57:01 is used to prevent abacavir hypersensitivity by avoiding drug exposure in individuals who carry at least one HLA-B*57:01 allele (dominant risk with respect to presence of at least one copy). Assume the following scientifically grounded setting.\n\n- Subpopulation A has HLA-B*57:01 allele frequency $p_{A}$ and is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE).\n- Subpopulation B has HLA-B*57:01 allele frequency $p_{B}$ and is in HWE.\n- An admixed cohort is formed by sampling a fraction $m$ from subpopulation A and a fraction $1 - m$ from subpopulation B, without interbreeding within the current generation (a mixture of HWE strata).

The context of HLA-B*57:01 and abacavir hypersensitivity is a canonical example of pharmacogenomics and is medically and scientifically accurate. The scenario described, a mixture of two populations each in HWE, is a classic model used to illustrate the Wahlund effect.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary variables ($m$, $p_A$, $p_B$) and clear definitions (HWE, carrier, pooled allele frequency) to derive a unique analytical solution for the deviation $\\Delta$.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically valid. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nLet the HLA-B*57:01 allele be denoted by $A$ and all other HLA-B alleles be collectively denoted by $a$. The frequency of allele $A$ is $p$ and the frequency of allele $a$ is $q=1-p$. The genotypes are $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$. A carrier is defined as an individual with at least one copy of the $A$ allele, so carriers have genotype $AA$ or $Aa$.\n\nIn a population in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) with allele frequency $p$, the genotype frequencies are:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $p^2$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $2p(1-p)$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $(1-p)^2$\n\nThe frequency of carriers, $C$, is the sum of the frequencies of genotypes $AA$ and $Aa$:\n$$C = p^2 + 2p(1-p) = p^2 + 2p - 2p^2 = 2p - p^2$$\nAlternatively, the carrier frequency can be calculated as $1$ minus the frequency of non-carriers (genotype $aa$):\n$$C = 1 - (1-p)^2$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the true carrier frequency, $C_{\\text{true}}$, in the admixed cohort. This cohort is a mechanical mixture of two populations that are themselves in HWE. The overall frequency of any genotype in the mixture is the weighted average of its frequency in the two subpopulations.\n\nIn subpopulation A, the allele frequency is $p_A$. The carrier frequency, $C_A$, is:\n$$C_A = 1 - (1-p_A)^2$$\n\nIn subpopulation B, the allele frequency is $p_B$. The carrier frequency, $C_B$, is:\n$$C_B = 1 - (1-p_B)^2$$\n\nThe admixed cohort consists of a fraction $m$ from subpopulation A and $1-m$ from subpopulation B. Therefore, the true carrier frequency in the admixed cohort is the weighted average of $C_A$ and $C_B$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = m C_A + (1-m) C_B$$\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = m [1 - (1-p_A)^2] + (1-m) [1 - (1-p_B)^2]$$\nExpanding the terms $(1-p)^2 = 1 - 2p + p^2$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = m [1 - (1 - 2p_A + p_A^2)] + (1-m) [1 - (1 - 2p_B + p_B^2)]$$\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = m (2p_A - p_A^2) + (1-m) (2p_B - p_B^2)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the carrier frequency, $C_{\\text{predicted}}$, that would be predicted by naively assuming the admixed cohort is in HWE. This naive prediction uses the pooled allele frequency, $\\bar{p}$, which is given as:\n$$\\bar{p} = m p_A + (1-m) p_B$$\nApplying the HWE formula for carrier frequency with this pooled allele frequency:\n$$C_{\\text{predicted}} = 1 - (1-\\bar{p})^2$$\nExpanding this expression:\n$$C_{\\text{predicted}} = 1 - (1 - 2\\bar{p} + \\bar{p}^2) = 2\\bar{p} - \\bar{p}^2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the deviation $\\Delta = C_{\\text{true}} - C_{\\text{predicted}}$.\n$$\\Delta = \\left[ m (2p_A - p_A^2) + (1-m) (2p_B - p_B^2) \\right] - \\left[ 2\\bar{p} - \\bar{p}^2 \\right]$$\nLet's rearrange the terms in the expression for $C_{\\text{true}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = 2(m p_A) - m p_A^2 + 2(1-m) p_B - (1-m) p_B^2$$\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = [2 m p_A + 2(1-m) p_B] - [m p_A^2 + (1-m) p_B^2]$$\nRecognizing that the first bracketed term is $2\\bar{p}$:\n$$C_{\\text{true}} = 2\\bar{p} - [m p_A^2 + (1-m) p_B^2]$$\nNow we can substitute this into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left( 2\\bar{p} - [m p_A^2 + (1-m) p_B^2] \\right) - \\left( 2\\bar{p} - \\bar{p}^2 \\right)$$\nThe $2\\bar{p}$ terms cancel out:\n$$\\Delta = \\bar{p}^2 - [m p_A^2 + (1-m) p_B^2]$$\nNow, substitute the definition of $\\bar{p} = m p_A + (1-m) p_B$ into this expression:\n$$\\Delta = (m p_A + (1-m) p_B)^2 - (m p_A^2 + (1-m) p_B^2)$$\nExpand the squared term:\n$$\\Delta = [m^2 p_A^2 + 2m(1-m)p_A p_B + (1-m)^2 p_B^2] - m p_A^2 - (1-m) p_B^2$$\nGroup terms with $p_A^2$ and $p_B^2$:\n$$\\Delta = (m^2 - m)p_A^2 + ((1-m)^2 - (1-m))p_B^2 + 2m(1-m)p_A p_B$$\nFactor the coefficients of the squared terms:\n$$m^2 - m = m(m-1) = -m(1-m)$$\n$$(1-m)^2 - (1-m) = (1-m)((1-m)-1) = (1-m)(-m) = -m(1-m)$$\nSubstitute these factored coefficients back into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = -m(1-m)p_A^2 - m(1-m)p_B^2 + 2m(1-m)p_A p_B$$\nFactor out the common term, $-m(1-m)$:\n$$\\Delta = -m(1-m)(p_A^2 + p_B^2 - 2p_A p_B)$$\nThe term in the parentheses is the expansion of $(p_A - p_B)^2$. Thus, we arrive at the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\Delta = -m(1-m)(p_A - p_B)^2$$\nThis result is a specific manifestation of the Wahlund effect. The quantity $m(1-m)(p_A-p_B)^2$ is the variance of the allele frequency across the two subpopulations. The deviation, $\\Delta$, is negative (or zero if $p_A=p_B$ or if $m=0$ or $m=1$), indicating that the true carrier frequency in an admixed population is less than or equal to the frequency predicted from the pooled allele frequency, a consequence of the deficit of heterozygotes in a structured population.",

A prospective validation against next-generation sequencing as the reference standard yields the following $2 \\times 2$ counts for the presence of HLA-B*15:02: true positives ($TP$) $=$ $156$, false negatives ($FN$) $=$ $4$, true negatives ($TN$) $=$ $1{,}828$, and false positives ($FP$) $=$ $12$.

There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and complete. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Detailed Solution\n\nThe solution requires a two-part calculation. First, we determine the performance characteristics of the assay—sensitivity and specificity—from the provided validation data. Second, we apply these characteristics to a population of a given size and allele prevalence to calculate the expected number of SJS/TEN cases under two different scenarios: no testing versus a \"test-and-avoid\" strategy. The difference between these two outcomes will represent the number of cases avoided.\n\n**Part 1: Assay Sensitivity and Specificity**\n\nSensitivity ($\\text{Se}$) is the ability of the test to correctly identify those with the condition (in this case, the HLA-B*15:02 allele). It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the total number of individuals with the allele.\nSpecificity ($\\text{Sp}$) is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the condition. It is calculated as the ratio of true negatives to the total number of individuals without the allele.\n\nGiven the validation counts: $TP = 156$, $FN = 4$, $TN = 1{,}828$, and $FP = 12$.\n\nThe total number of true carriers in the validation set is $TP + FN$.\nThe total number of true non-carriers in the validation set is $TN + FP$.\n\nSensitivity is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Se} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{156}{156 + 4} = \\frac{156}{160} = 0.975 $$\n\nSpecificity is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Sp} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}828 + 12} = \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840} $$\nThis fraction simplifies to $\\frac{457}{460}$, which is approximately $0.993478$. For accuracy, we will use the exact fraction in intermediate calculations.\n\n**Part 2: Expected SJS/TEN Cases in a Cohort of $100{,}000$ Initiators**\n\nWe analyze two scenarios for a cohort of $N = 100{,}000$ patients.\nThe prevalence of the HLA-B*15:02 allele is $p = 0.08$.\nThe risk of SJS/TEN in carriers is $R_p = 0.05$.\nThe risk of SJS/TEN in non-carriers is $R_n = 0.0002$.\n\nIn the cohort of $N = 100{,}000$:\nNumber of true carriers: $N_p = N \\times p = 100{,}000 \\times 0.08 = 8{,}000$.\nNumber of true non-carriers: $N_n = N \\times (1 - p) = 100{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.08) = 100{,}000 \\times 0.92 = 92{,}000$.\n\n**Scenario A: No Testing**\nIn this scenario, all $100{,}000$ patients receive carbamazepine. The expected number of SJS/TEN cases is the sum of cases arising from the carrier and non-carrier groups.\n\nExpected cases from carriers: $E_A(\\text{carriers}) = N_p \\times R_p = 8{,}000 \\times 0.05 = 400$.\nExpected cases from non-carriers: $E_A(\\text{non-carriers}) = N_n \\times R_n = 92{,}000 \\times 0.0002 = 18.4$.\n\nTotal expected cases without testing:\n$$ E_{\\text{no test}} = E_A(\\text{carriers}) + E_A(\\text{non-carriers}) = 400 + 18.4 = 418.4 $$\n\n**Scenario B: Test-and-Avoid Strategy**\nIn this scenario, only patients who test negative receive carbamazepine. This group consists of two sub-groups: false negatives (carriers who incorrectly test negative) and true negatives (non-carriers who correctly test negative).\n\nFirst, let's determine the number of patients in each test outcome category:\n-   Number of false negatives ($FN_{\\text{pop}}$): These are carriers who test negative.\n    $$ FN_{\\text{pop}} = N_p \\times (1 - \\text{Se}) = 8{,}000 \\times (1 - 0.975) = 8{,}000 \\times 0.025 = 200 $$\n-   Number of true negatives ($TN_{\\text{pop}}$): These are non-carriers who test negative.\n    $$ TN_{\\text{pop}} = N_n \\times \\text{Sp} = 92{,}000 \\times \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840} = 91{,}400 $$\n-   The other groups, true positives ($TP_{\\text{pop}} = N_p \\times \\text{Se} = 8{,}000 \\times 0.975 = 7{,}800$) and false positives ($FP_{\\text{pop}} = N_n \\times (1 - \\text{Sp}) = 92{,}000 \\times (1 - \\frac{1{,}828}{1{,}840}) = 92{,}000 \\times \\frac{12}{1{,}840} = 600$), do not receive carbamazepine and thus contribute $0$ cases of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN.\n\nNow, we calculate the expected number of SJS/TEN cases among those who receive the drug:\n-   Expected cases from false negatives (who are carriers and receive the drug):\n    $$ E_B(FN) = FN_{\\text{pop}} \\times R_p = 200 \\times 0.05 = 10 $$\n-   Expected cases from true negatives (who are non-carriers and receive the drug):\n    $$ E_B(TN) = TN_{\\text{pop}} \\times R_n = 91{,}400 \\times 0.0002 = 18.28 $$\n\nTotal expected cases with the test-and-avoid strategy:\n$$ E_{\\text{test}} = E_B(FN) + E_B(TN) = 10 + 18.28 = 28.28 $$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Cases Avoided**\n\nThe absolute number of SJS/TEN cases avoided is the difference between the expected cases in the \"no testing\" scenario and the \"test-and-avoid\" scenario.\n\n$$ \\text{Cases Avoided} = E_{\\text{no test}} - E_{\\text{test}} = 418.4 - 28.28 = 390.12 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$390.12$ rounded to four significant figures is $390.1$. This value represents the number of cases avoided per $100{,}000$ carbamazepine initiators.",
