By deriving the relationships from first principles, you will quantitatively see how a genetically-driven reduction in drug clearance ($CL$) leads to a predictable increase in both total drug exposure ($AUC$) and elimination half-life ($t_{1/2}$).

The administered dose is $D=100$ mg, the apparent systemic clearance is $CL=10$ L/h, and the absolute bioavailability is $F=0.5$. The apparent volume of distribution is $V=40$ L. The patient is later found to carry a genotype associated with reduced hepatic enzyme activity that lowers metabolic capacity such that $CL$ is reduced multiplicatively by a factor of $0.5$ (i.e., a $50\\%$ reduction), while $V$ and $F$ remain unchanged.\n\nStarting from the definition of clearance as the proportionality constant linking elimination rate to concentration under first-order elimination, and using the one-compartment model and the mass balance for the amount of drug in the body, derive a general expression for the area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) after a single dose as a function of $F$, $D$, and $CL$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard pharmacokinetic principles, self-contained, and well-posed. All necessary data and definitions for a unique solution are provided. We begin by deriving the general expressions as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the area under the plasma concentration–time curve ($AUC$). The fundamental principle of mass balance dictates that the total amount of drug eliminated from the body must equal the total amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation. The amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is the product of the administered dose, $D$, and the absolute bioavailability, $F$.\n$$\n\\text{Amount absorbed} = F \\cdot D\n$$\nThe rate of elimination of the drug from the body is defined as the product of the systemic clearance, $CL$, and the plasma drug concentration, $C(t)$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of elimination} = CL \\cdot C(t)\n$$\nThe total amount of drug eliminated over all time is the integral of the elimination rate from time $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\n$$\n\\text{Total amount eliminated} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} CL \\cdot C(t) \\, dt\n$$\nAssuming that clearance $CL$ is constant over the measurement period, it can be factored out of the integral.\n$$\n\\text{Total amount eliminated} = CL \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(t) \\, dt$ is the definition of the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity, denoted as $AUC$.\n$$\n\\text{Total amount eliminated} = CL \\cdot AUC\n$$\nEquating the amount absorbed with the amount eliminated gives:\n$$\nF \\cdot D = CL \\cdot AUC\n$$\nSolving for $AUC$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$\nAUC = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL}\n$$\nNext, we derive the general expression for the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$. For a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, the decline in the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, after the absorption phase is complete is described by the differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dA(t)}{dt} = -k_e A(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The solution to this equation is an exponential decay function:\n$$\nA(t) = A_0 \\exp(-k_e t)\n$$\nwhere $A_0$ is the amount of drug at the beginning of the elimination phase.
