The Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) offers a powerful framework for this, allowing us to predict genotype frequencies from known allele frequencies under specific assumptions. This practice challenges you to apply the first principles of HWE to estimate the proportion of individuals who are heterozygous carriers or poor metabolizers for a key *NUDT15* variant, a critical skill for population-level risk assessment.

Assume an autosomal locus with two alleles C and T, random mating, a large population, and no selection at this locus so that Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) holds. Let the minor allele frequency of T be $q$, and the major allele frequency of C be $p$, with $p+q=1$. Define the genotype categories by function: “poor metabolizers” correspond to the homozygous TT genotype, and “heterozygotes” correspond to the CT genotype. Using only the fundamental definition of HWE as the binomial sampling of alleles into genotypes under Mendelian inheritance, derive the expected genotype frequencies for CC, CT, and TT in terms of $p$ and $q$, and then express the proportion of poor metabolizers and the proportion of heterozygotes entirely in terms of $q$. Provide your final answer as a single row matrix containing, in order, the proportion of poor metabolizers and the proportion of heterozygotes.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of population genetics, specifically the Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), and its application to pharmacogenomics. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free of contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of genotype frequencies from the first principles of HWE, which models the distribution of genotypes in a population that satisfies several key assumptions: a large population size, random mating, and the absence of evolutionary influences such as mutation, gene flow, and natural selection. The problem states that these conditions hold.\n\nWe are considering a single autosomal locus with two alleles, a major allele C with frequency $p$ and a minor allele T with frequency $q$. The total frequency of alleles at this locus must sum to $1$, so we have the relation $p + q = 1$.\n\nUnder HWE, the formation of a diploid genotype for an individual is equivalent to drawing two alleles independently from the population's gene pool. In this pool, the probability of selecting an allele C is $p$, and the probability of selecting an allele T is $q$.\n\nWe can derive the expected frequencies of the three possible genotypes (CC, CT, and TT) as follows:\n\n1.  **Homozygous CC Genotype**: An individual with this genotype inherits a C allele from both parents. Since the allele draws are independent events, the probability of this combination is the product of their individual probabilities.\n    $$\n    f(CC) = p \\times p = p^{2}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Homozygous TT Genotype**: Similarly, an individual with the TT genotype inherits a T allele from both parents. The probability is:\n    $$\n    f(TT) = q \\times q = q^{2}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Heterozygous CT Genotype**: An individual can be heterozygous in two ways: by inheriting a C from the first parent and a T from the second, or by inheriting a T from the first and a C from the second. The probability of the first case is $p \\times q$, and the probability of the second case is $q \\times p$. Since these are mutually exclusive events, we sum their probabilities:\n    $$\n    f(CT) = (p \\times q) + (q \\times p) = 2pq\n    $$\n\nThese three frequencies, $p^{2}$, $2pq$, and $q^{2}$, represent the terms of the binomial expansion of $(p+q)^{2}$. As required by the completeness of probabilities, their sum is $p^{2} + 2pq + q^{2} = (p+q)^{2} = 1^{2} = 1$.\n\nThe problem defines two categories based on genotype:\n-   \"Poor metabolizers\" correspond to the homozygous TT genotype.\n-   \"Heterozygotes\" correspond to the CT genotype.\n\nThe task is to express the proportions of these two categories purely in terms of $q$, the minor allele frequency of T.\n\nThe proportion of poor metabolizers is the frequency of the TT genotype, which is:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of poor metabolizers} = f(TT) = q^{2}\n$$\nThis expression is already in terms of $q$.\n\nThe proportion of heterozygotes is the frequency of the CT genotype:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of heterozygotes} = f(CT) = 2pq\n$$\nTo express this solely in terms of $q$, we use the given relationship $p + q = 1$, which implies $p = 1 - q$. Substituting this into the expression for the heterozygote frequency gives:\n$$\n\\text{Proportion of heterozygotes} = 2(1-q)q = 2q - 2q^{2}\n$$\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the proportion of poor metabolizers followed by the proportion of heterozygotes. These are $q^{2}$ and $2q - 2q^{2}$, respectively.",

The calculation is to be based on the principle of additive gene dosage.\n\nLet $\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}$ represent the mean enzyme activity in individuals homozygous for the wild-type allele, and let $\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}$ represent the mean activity in individuals homozygous for a functionally null allele.

Let $A_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ be the activity contribution from a single wild-type allele and $A_{\\mathrm{null}}$ be the activity contribution from a single null allele.\n\nFor a homozygous wild-type individual ($\\mathrm{WT/WT}$), the total activity is the sum of contributions from two wild-type alleles:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}} = A_{\\mathrm{WT}} + A_{\\mathrm{WT}} = 2 A_{\\mathrm{WT}} $$\nFrom this, we can derive the activity contribution of a single wild-type allele:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{WT}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}}{2} $$\n\nFor a homozygous null individual ($\\mathrm{null/null}$), the total activity is the sum of contributions from two null alleles.

The problem states that for modeling purposes, the TPMT*3A allele is to be treated as functionally equivalent to a null allele. Therefore, we are calculating the expected activity for a $\\mathrm{WT/null}$ heterozygote, which we denote as $\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}}$.\n\nBased on the additive model, the expected activity for the heterozygote is the sum of the contribution from one wild-type allele and one null allele:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = A_{\\mathrm{WT}} + A_{\\mathrm{null}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $A_{\\mathrm{WT}}$ and $A_{\\mathrm{null}}$ derived from the homozygote means:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}}}{2} + \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}}{2} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/WT}} + \\mu_{\\mathrm{null/null}}}{2} $$\nThis result shows that under the additive gene dosage model, the expected activity of a heterozygote is the arithmetic mean of the two corresponding homozygote activities.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this derived formula:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{34.6 + 0.8}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = \\frac{35.4}{2} $$\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{WT/null}} = 17.7 \\, \\text{U/mL} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

Let $C(t)$ denote the intracellular RBC TGN concentration at time $t$, and let $D$ be the constant thiopurine dose rate. The model assumes that intracellular TGN formation is proportional to dose with proportionality constant $\\alpha$ (reflecting upstream activation steps unaffected by TPMT, per the assumption), and that TGN removal is first-order with two additive pathways: a NUDT15-mediated hydrolysis process with rate constant $k_{h}$ and a composite non-NUDT15 loss process (including other catabolic routes and cell-related loss) with rate constant $k_{d}$. Thus, TGN dynamics follow a linear mass-balance with constant input and first-order output.\n\nConsider two genotypes: a normal NUDT15 metabolizer (wild-type) and a NUDT15 poor metabolizer (homozygous loss-of-function).

This is a standard and scientifically valid approach in pharmacometrics. The roles of NUDT15 and TPMT in thiopurine metabolism are well-established pharmacological facts. The model is a simplification (e.g., assuming negligible TPMT differences) but this is a common and valid strategy to isolate the effect of a single variable (NUDT15 function).\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-defined.

The existence of a unique steady-state solution is guaranteed for a non-zero elimination rate.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n-   **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. The unknown constants $\\alpha$ and the target concentration $C_{ss,\\mathrm{target}}$ are expected to cancel out when calculating the dose ratio, which is typical for such problems.\n-   **Consistency**: The givens are internally consistent and do not present any contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\nThe dynamics of the intracellular RBC TGN concentration, $C(t)$, are described by a linear first-order ordinary differential equation representing the mass balance of TGN. The rate of change of concentration is the rate of formation minus the rate of elimination.\nThe formation rate is given as proportional to the dose rate $D$, with a constant $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\text{Formation Rate} = \\alpha D $$\nThe elimination process is first-order, with a total rate constant equal to the sum of the NUDT15-mediated and non-NUDT15 pathways, $k_h + k_d$. The elimination rate is thus:\n$$ \\text{Elimination Rate} = (k_h + k_d) C(t) $$\nThe differential equation governing $C(t)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\alpha D - (k_h + k_d) C(t) $$\nAt steady-state, the concentration is constant, so its time derivative is zero: $\\frac{dC_{ss}}{dt} = 0$. This gives:\n$$ 0 = \\alpha D - (k_h + k_d) C_{ss} $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration, $C_{ss}$:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{\\alpha D}{k_h + k_d} $$\nThis general expression relates the steady-state concentration to the dose rate and the elimination rate constants. We now apply this to the two specified genotypes.\n\nFor a normal metabolizer, the dose is $D_{\\mathrm{normal}}$ and the NUDT15 rate constant is $k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}}$. The steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\mathrm{normal}}$, is:\n$$ C_{ss,\\mathrm{normal}} = \\frac{\\alpha D_{\\mathrm{normal}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} + k_d} $$\nFor a poor metabolizer, the dose is $D_{\\mathrm{poor}}$ and the NUDT15 rate constant is $k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}}$. The steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\mathrm{poor}}$, is:\n$$ C_{ss,\\mathrm{poor}} = \\frac{\\alpha D_{\\mathrm{poor}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} + k_d} $$\nThe problem requires that both genotypes achieve the same target steady-state concentration, $C_{ss,\\mathrm{target}}$. Thus, we set $C_{ss,\\mathrm{normal}} = C_{ss,\\mathrm{poor}} = C_{ss,\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha D_{\\mathrm{normal}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} + k_d} = \\frac{\\alpha D_{\\mathrm{poor}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} + k_d} $$\nThe unknown formation constant $\\alpha$ is a common factor on both sides and can be canceled, as it is assumed to be identical for both genotypes:\n$$ \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{normal}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} + k_d} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{poor}}}{k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} + k_d} $$\nWe are asked to find the dose reduction factor, $f$, defined as the ratio $D_{\\mathrm{poor}} / D_{\\mathrm{normal}}$. Rearranging the above equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ f = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{poor}}}{D_{\\mathrm{normal}}} = \\frac{k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} + k_d}{k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} + k_d} $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the dose reduction factor. It represents the ratio of the total elimination clearance of the poor metabolizer to that of the normal metabolizer.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $f$. We are given the following information:\n-   $k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} = 0.10\\,k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}}$\n-   $k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} = 0.16\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n-   $k_d = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, calculate the value of $k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}}$:\n$$ k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} = 0.10 \\times 0.16\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1} = 0.016\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1} $$\nNow, substitute the numerical values of the rate constants into the expression for $f$:\n$$ f = \\frac{k_{h,\\mathrm{poor}} + k_d}{k_{h,\\mathrm{normal}} + k_d} = \\frac{0.016\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1} + 0.02\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}}{0.16\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1} + 0.02\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}} $$\n$$ f = \\frac{0.036\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}}{0.18\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}} $$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$ cancel, yielding a dimensionless number, as expected for a factor.\n$$ f = \\frac{0.036}{0.18} = \\frac{36}{180} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ f = 0.200 $$\nThe dose for a poor NUDT15 metabolizer must be $20\\%$ of the dose for a normal metabolizer to achieve the same target steady-state TGN concentration, under the assumptions of this model.",
