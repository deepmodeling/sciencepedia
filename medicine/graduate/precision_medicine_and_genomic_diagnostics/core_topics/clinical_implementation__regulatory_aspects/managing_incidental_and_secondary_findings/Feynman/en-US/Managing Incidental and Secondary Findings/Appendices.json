We will start from the definitions of Bayes' theorem, odds, and Bayes factors.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the variant is truly pathogenic. The complementary event, $D^c$, is that the variant is benign. The problem provides the prior probability of pathogenicity for a rare, protein-altering variant in an\nACMG Secondary Findings gene:\n$$\nP(D) = 0.01\n$$\nFrom this, the prior probability of the variant being benign is:\n$$\nP(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99\n$$\nThe analysis is simplified by using the odds formulation of Bayes' theorem. The prior odds in favor of pathogenicity are the ratio of the prior probabilities:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.01}{0.99}\n$$\nBayes' theorem in odds form states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the Bayes Factor (BF):\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(D|E) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times \\text{BF}(E)\n$$\nwhere $E$ represents the collected evidence and $\\text{Odds}(D|E) = \\frac{P(D|E)}{P(D^c|E)}$.

This assumption allows the total Bayes Factor for the combined evidence ($E = E_1, E_2, E_3$) to be calculated as the product of the individual Bayes Factors for each piece of evidence:\n$$\n\\text{BF}(E) = \\text{BF}(E_1) \\times \\text{BF}(E_2) \\times \\text{BF}(E_3)\n$$\nThe problem provides the calibrated strengths for each ACMG evidence code as a Bayes Factor:\n-   For $E_1$ (PVS1, Very Strong): $\\text{BF}(E_1) = 350$\n-   For $E_2$ (PM2\\_Supporting, Supporting): $\\text{BF}(E_2) = 2.08$\n-   For $E_3$ (PP3, Supporting): $\\text{BF}(E_3) = 2.08$\n\nWe can now compute the total Bayes Factor:\n$$\n\\text{BF}(E) = 350 \\times 2.08 \\times 2.08 = 350 \\times (2.08)^2 = 350 \\times 4.3264 = 1514.24\n$$\nWith the total Bayes Factor, we calculate the posterior odds of pathogenicity:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(D|E) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times \\text{BF}(E) = \\left(\\frac{0.01}{0.99}\\right) \\times 1514.24\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(D|E) \\approx 0.010101... \\times 1514.24 \\approx 15.295353...\n$$\nFinally, we must convert the posterior odds back into a posterior probability.

This practice  delves into the statistical and ethical calculus behind this decision, moving from test characteristics like sensitivity to the real-world predictive value of a result.

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory performing comprehensive genomic sequencing identifies an incidental finding in a gene that has a well-established association with a preventable adult-onset condition. To manage such incidental or secondary findings, the laboratory must decide whether to report a positive result for this gene-disease association based on the expected benefit versus harm of acting on the result.\n\nAssume the following are known and have been validated in the relevant population:\n- The pre-test probability of truly having the actionable disease phenotype is $\\pi = 0.005$.\n- The assay calls “positive” when the pipeline classifies the gene-disease association as present, with sensitivity $Se = 0.9$ and specificity $Sp = 0.995$.\n- The cost of a false positive (FP), denoted $C_{FP}$, is $C_{FP} = 1$ in normalized utility units (dimensionless).\n- The cost of a false negative (FN), denoted $C_{FN}$, is $C_{FN} = 5$ in normalized utility units (dimensionless).\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem for conditional probability, first derive the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of the positive assay result, $PPV = P(\\text{disease} \\mid \\text{positive})$.\n\nThen, using first principles of decision theory, define the reporting decision threshold as the point at which the expected loss of acting on a positive result equals the expected loss of not acting. From this principle, determine the net utility difference, $U$, between acting versus not acting on a positive result in this context, expressed as a single number. A positive $U$ implies that acting (reporting and recommending follow-up) has utility exceeding the threshold; a negative $U$ implies it does not.\n\nRound your final net utility difference to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a dimensionless number.",
            "solution": "Let $D$ be the event that a person has the actionable disease phenotype, and let $D^c$ be the event that the person does not. The pre-test probability, or prevalence, is given as $P(D) = \\pi = 0.005$. The probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - \\pi = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n\nLet $T$ be the event of a positive assay result, and $T^c$ be the event of a negative result. The test characteristics are given as:\n- Sensitivity: $Se = P(T|D) = 0.9$. This is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present.\n- Specificity: $Sp = P(T^c|D^c) = 0.995$. This is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent.\n\nFrom specificity, we can find the false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent:\n$P(T|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe Positive Predictive Value, $PPV$, is the probability that a person has the disease given that they received a positive test result, i.e., $P(D|T)$. We use Bayes' theorem to find this value:\n$$PPV = P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)}$$\nFirst, we must calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(T) = (Se \\times \\pi) + ((1 - Sp) \\times (1 - \\pi))$$\n$$P(T) = (0.9 \\times 0.005) + (0.005 \\times 0.995)$$\n$$P(T) = 0.0045 + 0.004975 = 0.009475$$\nNow we can compute the $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\times \\pi}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 0.005}{0.009475} = \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}$$\nThe exact fractional value is $PPV = \\frac{4500}{9475} = \\frac{180}{379}$. The probability of a false positive, given a positive test, is $P(D^c|T) = 1 - P(D|T) = 1 - PPV$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Net Utility Difference (U)**\nThe decision to act or not act is made *after* a positive result is observed. Therefore, all calculations are conditional on the event $T$. Utility is the negative of loss ($U = -L$). The net utility difference, $U$, between acting and not acting is defined as $U = U_{\\text{act}} - U_{\\text{not act}} = (-L_{\\text{act}}) - (-L_{\\text{not act}}) = L_{\\text{not act}} - L_{\\text{act}}$, where $L$ denotes the expected loss.\n\n1.  **Expected Loss of Acting on the Positive Result ($L_{\\text{act}}$):**\n    If we act, we proceed as if the patient has the disease. A loss is incurred only if this is incorrect, i.e., if the positive test was a false positive. The probability of this is $P(D^c|T) = 1-PPV$.\n    The cost of a false positive is $C_{FP} = 1$.\n    The cost of a true positive (acting correctly) is assumed to be $0$.\n    $$L_{\\text{act}} = (C_{FP} \\times P(D^c|T)) + (0 \\times P(D|T)) = C_{FP} \\times (1 - PPV)$$\n\n2.  **Expected Loss of Not Acting on the Positive Result ($L_{\\text{not act}}$):**\n    If we do not act, we proceed as if the patient does not have the disease, effectively ignoring the positive test result. A loss is incurred only if the patient truly has the disease, which corresponds to a false negative *decision*. The probability of this is $P(D|T) = PPV$.\n    The cost of a false negative is $C_{FN} = 5$.\n    The cost of a true negative (not acting when the patient is disease-free) is assumed to be $0$.\n    $$L_{\\text{not act}} = (C_{FN} \\times P(D|T)) + (0 \\times P(D^c|T)) = C_{FN} \\times PPV$$\n\nThe net utility difference $U$ is:\n$$U = L_{\\text{not act}} - L_{\\text{act}} = (C_{FN} \\times PPV) - (C_{FP} \\times (1 - PPV))$$\nSubstituting the values and the expression for $PPV$:\n$$U = \\left(5 \\times \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}\\right) - \\left(1 \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{0.0045}{0.009475}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$U = \\frac{5 \\times 0.0045}{0.009475} - \\frac{0.009475 - 0.0045}{0.009475}$$\n$$U = \\frac{0.0225}{0.009475} - \\frac{0.004975}{0.009475}$$\n$$U = \\frac{0.0225 - 0.004975}{0.009475} = \\frac{0.017525}{0.009475}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$U \\approx 1.8496042216...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$U \\approx 1.850$$\nSince $U > 0$, the utility of acting on the positive result is greater than the utility of not acting, indicating that the expected benefits outweigh the expected harms under this model.",

You are tasked with managing this secondary finding by comparing two actionability frameworks that both adhere to the principle of expected utility from decision theory but differ in how they weight iatrogenic harms.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n- Expected utility is defined as the probability-weighted sum of utilities across mutually exclusive outcomes: if outcomes $x_{i}$ occur with probabilities $p_{i}$ and carry utilities $u(x_{i})$, then the expected utility is $\\sum_{i} p_{i} u(x_{i})$.\n- Absolute risk reduction equals the difference in outcome probabilities under intervention versus no intervention and directly scales the expected avoided disutility of the disease on a quality-adjusted utility scale.\n- Utilities can be expressed on a unitless, quality-adjusted scale commensurable across disease and complication outcomes, conceptually akin to quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) differences but reported here without units.\n\nAssume:\n- The posterior probability that the asserted gene-disease association and the intervention effectiveness apply to this individual is $q = 0.9$.\n- The disease, if it occurs, carries a mean disutility $S = 0.8$ on the utility scale.\n- A significant surgical complication, if it occurs, carries a mean disutility $C = 0.25$ on the same scale.\n- The act of undergoing the procedure, independent of complications, carries a baseline disutility $D = 0.02$ on the same scale.\n\nDefine two frameworks:\n- Framework $\\mathcal{F}_{1}$ (benefit-harm parity): Compute the net expected utility of recommending preventive surgery by subtracting the expected iatrogenic disutility from the expected avoided disease disutility, with no additional weighting of harms beyond their utilities.\n- Framework $\\mathcal{F}_{2}$ (harm-averse weighting): Compute the same net expected utility, but multiply the total iatrogenic disutility term by a precautionary factor $k = 2$ to reflect an ethically conservative stance toward iatrogenic harms specifically in secondary finding contexts.\n\nUsing only the above bases and assumptions, derive from first principles the net expected utility under each framework and then compute the difference $\\Delta = U_1 - U_2$, where $U_j$ denotes the net expected utility under framework $\\mathcal{F}_j$.
