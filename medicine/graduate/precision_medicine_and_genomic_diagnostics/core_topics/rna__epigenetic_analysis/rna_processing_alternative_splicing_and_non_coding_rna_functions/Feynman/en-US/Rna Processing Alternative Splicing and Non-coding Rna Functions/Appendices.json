            "problem": "In targeted ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing for precision oncology panels, cassette exon inclusion events are routinely quantified to evaluate alternative splicing changes linked to disease mechanisms and therapeutic response. Starting from the Central Dogma of molecular biology and the definition of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) processing, consider that junction-spanning reads mapping uniquely to inclusion-supporting and exclusion-supporting splice junctions sample isoform abundances proportional to their effective detectable lengths and assay efficiencies, scaled by the sequencing depth. Assume the following foundational base:\n- Pre-mRNA splicing partitions transcripts into isoforms that either include or exclude a cassette exon.\n- Under uniform fragmentation and unbiased sampling conditional on assay efficiency, expected junction reads are proportional to the product of isoform abundance, effective detectable junction length, assay efficiency, and library size.\n- Condition-level inclusion fraction is estimated from replicates by pooling corrected counts that remove library size, effective length, and efficiency effects.\n\nA targeted panel measures a single cassette exon event in a tumor-normal pair, each with two biological replicates. For each replicate $j$, denote by $I_{j}$ the deduplicated inclusion junction read count and by $E_{j}$ the deduplicated exclusion junction count. Let $s_{j}$ be the sample’s library size in millions of mapped reads. Event-specific parameters determined by external controls are the effective detectable junction lengths $L_{I} = 140$ nucleotides and $L_{E} = 160$ nucleotides, and the junction-specific detection efficiencies $\\alpha_{I} = 0.90$ and $\\alpha_{E} = 0.95$.\n\nData:\n- Normal condition:\n  - Replicate $\\mathrm{N}_{1}$: $I_{\\mathrm{N}_{1}} = 480$, $E_{\\mathrm{N}_{1}} = 1520$, $s_{\\mathrm{N}_{1}} = 40$.\n  - Replicate $\\mathrm{N}_{2}$: $I_{\\mathrm{N}_{2}} = 720$, $E_{\\mathrm{N}_{2}} = 2100$, $s_{\\mathrm{N}_{2}} = 60$.\n- Tumor condition:\n  - Replicate $\\mathrm{T}_{1}$: $I_{\\mathrm{T}_{1}} = 2200$, $E_{\\mathrm{T}_{1}} = 800$, $s_{\\mathrm{T}_{1}} = 50$.\n  - Replicate $\\mathrm{T}_{2}$: $I_{\\mathrm{T}_{2}} = 2600$, $E_{\\mathrm{T}_{2}} = 900$, $s_{\\mathrm{T}_{2}} = 55$.\n\nUse the foundational base to derive the inclusion fraction estimator for a condition by pooling bias-corrected, length-normalized counts across replicates.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular biology and bioinformatics, specifically RNA sequencing analysis. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are realistic.\n\nThe core task is to compute the change in the \"percent spliced-in\" ($\\Psi$) of a cassette exon between a tumor and a normal condition. The value of $\\Psi$ represents the proportion of transcripts that include the exon. It is defined as:\n$$\n\\Psi = \\frac{\\theta_I}{\\theta_I + \\theta_E}\n$$\nwhere $\\theta_I$ is the abundance of the inclusion isoform and $\\theta_E$ is the abundance of the exclusion isoform.\n\nThe problem states that the expected number of junction reads for an isoform is proportional to the product of its abundance ($\\theta$), the effective detectable junction length ($L$), the junction-specific detection efficiency ($\\alpha$), and the library size ($N$). For a given replicate $j$, the observed inclusion counts ($I_j$) and exclusion counts ($E_j$) can be modeled as:\n$$\nI_j \\approx k \\cdot \\theta_{I,j} \\cdot L_I \\cdot \\alpha_I \\cdot N_j\n$$\n$$\nE_j \\approx k \\cdot \\theta_{E,j} \\cdot L_E \\cdot \\alpha_E \\cdot N_j\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a technology-dependent proportionality constant and $j$ indexes the replicate. The library size $N_j$ is given in millions of mapped reads, so we can write $N_j = s_j \\times 10^6$ where $s_j$ is the value provided.\n\nTo estimate the abundance $\\theta$, we must correct the raw read counts for the biases introduced by length, efficiency, and library size. A \"corrected count\" for a replicate $j$, which is proportional to the true isoform abundance, can be defined by rearranging the model equations:\n$$\nI'_j = \\frac{I_j}{L_I \\cdot \\alpha_I \\cdot N_j} \\propto \\theta_{I,j}\n$$\n$$\nE'_j = \\frac{E_j}{L_E \\cdot \\alpha_E \\cdot N_j} \\propto \\theta_{E,j}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the condition-level inclusion fraction, $\\Psi_C$, for a condition $C$ (Normal or Tumor) is estimated by pooling these corrected counts across all replicates $j$ belonging to that condition.

The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters and rules are provided to determine the NMD status and calculate the fold-change for every isoform. The instructions are clear, allowing for a unique solution. The rule for handling cases where both NMD mechanisms are triggered is explicitly stated (\"take the larger multiplier\"), preventing ambiguity.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free from subjective language.\n-   The problem setup is complete, internally consistent, and scientifically feasible within the given model. It is not trivial or tautological, as it requires the systematic application of multiple rules to different cases.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine which isoforms are targets of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) and to calculate the fold-change in their steady-state abundance, $F$, upon inhibition of UPF1.\n\n**General Formula for Fold-Change ($F$)**\n\nThe steady-state abundance of an mRNA isoform is given by $S = k_{s} / k_{d}$.\n\nUnder normal (NMD-active) conditions, the decay rate is $k_{d, \\text{active}} = f \\cdot k_{d}^{0}$, where $f$ is the NMD decay multiplier. If an isoform is not an NMD target, its decay rate is the basal rate, which corresponds to $f=1$. The steady-state abundance is $S_{\\text{NMD-active}} = k_{s} / (f \\cdot k_{d}^{0})$.\n\nUnder UPF1 inhibition, NMD is abrogated, and the decay rate for all isoforms reverts to the basal rate, $k_{d, \\text{inhibited}} = k_{d}^{0}$. The steady-state abundance is $S_{\\text{UPF1-inhibited}} = k_{s} / k_{d}^{0}$.\n\nThe fold-change $F$ is the ratio of the abundance under inhibition to the abundance under active NMD:\n$$\nF = \\frac{S_{\\text{UPF1-inhibited}}}{S_{\\text{NMD-active}}} = \\frac{k_{s} / k_{d}^{0}}{k_{s} / (f \\cdot k_{d}^{0})} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}^{0}} \\cdot \\frac{f \\cdot k_{d}^{0}}{k_{s}} = f\n$$\nThus, the fold-change $F$ is simply equal to the NMD decay multiplier $f$. For isoforms not targeted by NMD, $f=1$, and therefore $F=1$. For NMD targets, $F$ will be either $f_E=4$ or $f_U=2$. We now analyze each isoform.\n\n**Analysis of Isoform A**\n-   Last exon-exon junction: $J_{2} = 750$.\n-   Stop codon position: $P_{A} = 680$.\n-   3' UTR length: $U_{A} = 900$.\n-   **EJC-dependent NMD:** The stop codon at $P_{A}$ is located $J_{2} - P_{A} = 750 - 680 = 70$ nucleotides upstream of the last junction. Since $70 \\ge 50$, Isoform A is a target for EJC-dependent NMD.\n-   **Long 3' UTR NMD:** The 3' UTR length is $U_{A} = 900$. The threshold is $U^{*} = 1200$. Since $900 < 1200$, it is not a target for long 3' UTR NMD.\n-   **Conclusion:** Isoform A is an NMD target. The applicable multiplier is $f = f_{E} = 4$. The fold-change is $F_{A} = 4$.\n\n**Analysis of Isoform B**\n-   Last exon-exon junction: $J_{2} = 750$.\n-   Stop codon position: $P_{B} = 980$.\n-   3' UTR length: $U_{B} = 1300$.\n-   **EJC-dependent NMD:** The stop codon at $P_{B} = 980$ is located downstream of the last junction at $J_{2} = 750$. Therefore, it does not meet the \"upstream\" criterion and is not a target for EJC-dependent NMD.\n-   **Long 3' UTR NMD:** The 3' UTR length is $U_{B} = 1300$. The threshold is $U^{*} = 1200$. Since $1300 \\ge 1200$, Isoform B is a target for long 3' UTR NMD.\n-   **Conclusion:** Isoform B is an NMD target. The applicable multiplier is $f = f_{U} = 2$. The fold-change is $F_{B} = 2$.\n\n**Analysis of Isoform C**\n-   Last exon-exon junction: $J_{2} = 750$.\n-   Stop codon position: $P_{C} = 720$.\n-   3' UTR length: $U_{C} = 600$.\n-   **EJC-dependent NMD:** The stop codon at $P_{C}$ is located $J_{2} - P_{C} = 750 - 720 = 30$ nucleotides upstream of the last junction. Since $30 < 50$, it is not a target for EJC-dependent NMD.\n-   **Long 3' UTR NMD:** The 3' UTR length is $U_{C} = 600$. The threshold is $U^{*} = 1200$. Since $600 < 1200$, it is not a target for long 3' UTR NMD.\n-   **Conclusion:** Isoform C is not an NMD target. The multiplier is $f=1$. The fold-change is $F_{C} = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of Isoform D**\n-   Last exon-exon junction: None (intronless transcript).\n-   Stop codon position: $P_{D} = 1000$.\n-   3' UTR length: $U_{D} = 800$.\n-   **EJC-dependent NMD:** As there are no exon-exon junctions, there are no EJCs to recruit NMD factors. This mechanism is not applicable.\n-   **Long 3' UTR NMD:** The 3' UTR length is $U_{D} = 800$. The threshold is $U^{*} = 1200$. Since $800 < 1200$, it is not a target for long 3' UTR NMD.\n-   **Conclusion:** Isoform D is not an NMD target. The multiplier is $f=1$. The fold-change is $F_{D} = 1$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n-   **NMD Targets:** Isoforms A and B.\n-   **Fold-changes:** $F_{A} = 4$, $F_{B} = 2$, $F_{C} = 1$, $F_{D} = 1$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nWe now evaluate the provided options against our derived results.\n\n**A.
