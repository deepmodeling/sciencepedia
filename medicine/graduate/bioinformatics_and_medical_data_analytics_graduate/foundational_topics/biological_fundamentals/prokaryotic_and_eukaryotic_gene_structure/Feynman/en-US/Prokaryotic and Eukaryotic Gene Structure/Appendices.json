This exercise provides a foundational calculation to translate the structural map of a eukaryotic gene, with its exons and introns, into the lengths of its precursor and mature messenger RNA (mRNA). Understanding this transformation is a critical first step in gene analysis and is essential for practical applications such as designing intronless expression constructs for prokaryotic hosts .",

            "problem": "A synthetic biologist is analyzing a eukaryotic gene to design an equivalent prokaryotic expression construct. The eukaryotic gene occupies a total genomic span of $4\\,\\text{kb}$ and contains $3$ exons of lengths $150\\,\\text{bp}$, $1200\\,\\text{bp}$, and $300\\,\\text{bp}$, separated by $2$ introns of lengths $900\\,\\text{bp}$ and $1450\\,\\text{bp}$. Assume the following: (i) transcription initiates upstream of the first exon and terminates downstream of the last exon such that the primary transcript (precursor messenger ribonucleic acid, pre-mRNA) contains all exons and introns given; (ii) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) maturation in the eukaryote removes introns completely by spliceosomal splicing with no intron retention; (iii) ignore $5^{\\prime}$ capping, $3^{\\prime}$ polyadenylation, and untranslated region (UTR) contributions beyond the given exon lengths; and (iv) in the prokaryotic design, the same coding region is encoded as a single continuous unit with no introns, and transcription yields an mRNA that is colinear with that coding region, with no additional untranslated leaders or trailers.\n\nUsing only foundational principles of the Central Dogma (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the definition of exons and introns, and the well-established absence of spliceosomal introns in canonical prokaryotic genes, derive expressions for the lengths of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA, the eukaryotic mature mRNA, and the corresponding prokaryotic mRNA in terms of the exon and intron lengths. Then evaluate these expressions for the provided exon and intron sizes.\n\nProvide your final numerical answers as exact integers in nucleotides (nt). Report the three values in the order: eukaryotic pre-mRNA length, eukaryotic mature mRNA length, prokaryotic mRNA length. Express the final answer as a single row matrix. No rounding is required. Do not include units in the final boxed answer; elsewhere, express lengths in nt.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of molecular biology, specifically the Central Dogma and the structural distinctions between eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes. The givens are self-contained, consistent, and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe core principle being tested is the process of gene expression. In eukaryotes, the transcription of a gene from its deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) template results in a precursor messenger ribonucleic acid (pre-mRNA). This pre-mRNA molecule is a direct transcript of the gene's sequence, which includes both coding regions, known as exons, and non-coding intervening sequences, known as introns. Through a process called splicing, introns are excised and exons are joined together to form a mature messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). In contrast, canonical prokaryotic genes are not interrupted by spliceosomal introns, and the transcribed mRNA is colinear with the coding DNA sequence. The problem requires us to calculate the lengths of the intermediate and final RNA products based on these principles.\n\nLet $N_E$ be the number of exons and $N_I$ be the number of introns. Let $L_{E_i}$ be the length of the $i$-th exon and $L_{I_j}$ be the length of the $j$-th intron, for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_E\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, N_I\\}$. The lengths are provided in base pairs (bp), which for the purpose of single-stranded RNA length correspond directly to nucleotides (nt).\n\nThe givens are:\n$N_E = 3$\n$L_{E_1} = 150\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{E_2} = 1200\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{E_3} = 300\\,\\text{nt}$\n$N_I = 2$\n$L_{I_1} = 900\\,\\text{nt}$\n$L_{I_2} = 1450\\,\\text{nt}$\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the length of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}}$. According to assumption (i), the pre-mRNA is the primary transcript containing all exons and introns. Its length is therefore the sum of the lengths of all individual exons and introns.\n$$L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i} + \\sum_{j=1}^{N_I} L_{I_j}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the length of the eukaryotic mature mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}}$. According to assumption (ii), the mature mRNA is produced by splicing, which removes all introns. Assumption (iii) instructs us to ignore other features like the $5'$ cap and $3'$ poly(A) tail. Thus, the length of the mature mRNA is simply the sum of the lengths of all exons.\n$$L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i}$$\n\nThird, we derive the expression for the length of the corresponding prokaryotic mRNA, denoted $L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}}$. The problem specifies a synthetic prokaryotic construct designed to express the same protein. This implies that the coding sequence of the prokaryotic gene must be identical to the coding sequence of the spliced eukaryotic mRNA. In prokaryotes, transcription is colinear. Assumption (iv) states that we ignore untranslated leader and trailer sequences. Therefore, the length of the prokaryotic mRNA must be equal to the total length of the exons from the original eukaryotic gene.\n$$L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_E} L_{E_i} = L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}}$$\n\nNow we perform the calculations using the provided values.\nThe total length of the exons is:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = L_{E_1} + L_{E_2} + L_{E_3} = 150 + 1200 + 300 = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\nThe total length of the introns is:\n$$\\sum_{j=1}^{2} L_{I_j} = L_{I_1} + L_{I_2} = 900 + 1450 = 2350\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nUsing these sums, we evaluate the length of each RNA molecule.\n\nLength of the eukaryotic pre-mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{pre-mRNA}} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i}\\right) + \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{2} L_{I_j}\\right) = 1650 + 2350 = 4000\\,\\text{nt}$$\nThis result is consistent with the provided total genomic span of $4\\,\\text{kb}$, which is $4000\\,\\text{bp}$.\n\nLength of the eukaryotic mature mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{mature-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nLength of the prokaryotic mRNA:\n$$L_{\\text{prok-mRNA}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} L_{E_i} = 1650\\,\\text{nt}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be a single row matrix containing the three calculated lengths in the order: eukaryotic pre-mRNA length, eukaryotic mature mRNA length, and prokaryotic mRNA length. The values are $4000$, $1650$, and $1650$, respectively.",

The standard HMM factorization for the joint probability is\n$$\np(y_{1:T}, x_{1:T}) = \\pi_{y_1} \\cdot b_{y_1}(x_1) \\cdot \\prod_{t=2}^{T} a_{y_{t-1}, y_t} \\cdot b_{y_t}(x_t),\n$$\nwhere $\\pi_s$ are initial probabilities, $a_{i,j}$ are transition probabilities, and $b_s(x)$ are emission probabilities.\n\nTo incorporate splice-aware boundary preferences, we introduce a boundary factor $g(y_{t-1}, y_t, x_{t-1}, x_t)$ that multiplies the transition at each step to upweight likely donor and acceptor motifs, giving a generalized factorization:\n$$\np(y_{1:T}, x_{1:T}) = \\pi_{y_1} \\cdot b_{y_1}(x_1) \\cdot \\prod_{t=2}^{T} \\left[ a_{y_{t-1}, y_t} \\cdot g(y_{t-1}, y_t, x_{t-1}, x_t) \\cdot b_{y_t}(x_t) \\right].\n$$\nThe boundary factor $g$ is defined to be $0.9$ for a donor-compatible pair when $(y_{t-1}, y_t) = (3, 4)$ and $(x_{t-1}, x_t) = (\\text{G}, \\text{T})$, or $0.9$ for an acceptor-compatible pair when $(y_{t-1}, y_t) = (4, 3)$ and $(x_{t-1}, x_t) = (\\text{A}, \\text{G})$; otherwise $g$ is $0.1$ for those exon-intron switching transitions, and $1.0$ for all other transitions. This maintains local dependence only on $(x_{t-1}, x_t)$ so that dynamic programming remains valid, since each factor at time $t$ depends solely on $(y_{t-1}, y_t)$ and the adjacent observations.\n\nWe seek the maximizer\n$$\n\\hat{y}_{1:T} = \\arg\\max_{y_{1:T}} \\; p(y_{1:T}, x_{1:T}).\n$$\nBecause products of probabilities can underflow numerically, we work with log-probabilities and convert products to sums. Define\n$$\n\\ell_{\\pi}(s) = \\log \\pi_s,\\quad \\ell_a(i,j) = \\log a_{i,j},\\quad \\ell_b(s,x) = \\log b_s(x),\\quad \\ell_g(i,j,x',x) = \\log g(i,j,x',x).\n$$\nLet the dynamic programming table be\n$$\n\\delta_t(s) = \\max_{y_{1:t-1}} \\log \\left[ \\pi_{y_1} b_{y_1}(x_1) \\prod_{k=2}^{t} a_{y_{k-1}, y_k} \\, g(y_{k-1}, y_k, x_{k-1}, x_k) \\, b_{y_k}(x_k) \\right],\n$$\nwhich is the maximum log-probability of a path ending in state $s$ at time $t$. The initialization at $t=1$ is\n$$\n\\delta_1(s) = \\ell_{\\pi}(s) + \\ell_b(s, x_1),\n$$\nand the recursion for $t \\ge 2$ is\n$$\n\\delta_t(s) = \\max_{s' \\in \\{0,\\dots,5\\}} \\left[ \\delta_{t-1}(s') + \\ell_a(s', s) + \\ell_g(s', s, x_{t-1}, x_t) + \\ell_b(s, x_t) \\right].\n$$\nTo recover the maximizing state path, we store backpointers\n$$\n\\psi_t(s) = \\arg\\max_{s' \\in \\{0,\\dots,5\\}} \\left[ \\delta_{t-1}(s') + \\ell_a(s', s) + \\ell_g(s', s, x_{t-1}, x_t) \\right],\n$$\nand then perform traceback:\n- Let $y_T = \\arg\\max_{s} \\delta_T(s)$.\n- For $t$ from $T$ down to $2$, set $y_{t-1} = \\psi_t(y_t)$.\n\nThe result $\\hat{y}_{1:T}$ is the most likely sequence under the model.\n\nAlgorithmic design details:\n- Disallowed transitions have $a_{i,j} = 0$, which maps to $\\ell_a(i,j) = -\\infty$; these are excluded from the maximization.\n- The observation alphabet is mapped to indices $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$ as A $\\rightarrow$ $0$, C $\\rightarrow$ $1$, G $\\rightarrow$ $2$, T $\\rightarrow$ $3$, so that $\\ell_b(s, x_t)$ can be accessed via array indexing.\n- Computation is in the natural log domain using $-\\infty$ for $\\log 0$; standard floating-point handling allows the $\\max$ operation to ignore $-\\infty$ entries.\n- The boundary factor $\\ell_g$ is computed per candidate transition using $(x_{t-1}, x_t)$, which is available at the time of updating $\\delta_t(s)$, thus preserving the dynamic programming structure.\n\nScientific rationale:\n- The Central Dogma and known eukaryotic gene architecture motivate states for intergenic regions, promoters, untranslated regions, exons, and introns.\n- The HMM formalism captures the stochastic switching among these states and the nucleotide composition biases in each state through emission distributions.\n- Splice donor and acceptor consensus motifs are incorporated by modulating the transition likelihoods at exon-intron boundaries via the boundary factor $g$, preserving locality so that the Viterbi recursion remains valid.\n\nApplying this derivation, the implementation proceeds by:\n- Defining $\\pi$, $A$, $B$, and the boundary factor function $g$ with the specified numerical values.\n- Implementing the log-domain Viterbi algorithm with backpointers for each test sequence.\n- Returning the decoded state sequences using the integer coding $0$ through $5$ in the specified single-line output format.\n\nThe test suite comprises three sequences. For each, the algorithm outputs a list of integers of length equal to the sequence length, representing the most likely state at each position. The final output is a single line containing a list of these three lists, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets, with no additional text.",
