These metrics are fundamental in bioinformatics for assessing library complexity and PCR amplification bias. The provided numerical values are realistic for a ChIP-seq experiment. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and clearly defined formulas (or references to standard definitions) to compute the required value, $G$. Each metric—NRF, PBC1, and PBC2—has a standard, unambiguous definition in the field. The calculation of the geometric mean $G$ is a straightforward mathematical operation. Therefore, a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is therefore deemed **valid**. The solution will be provided below.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a composite quality score, $G$, for a ChIP-seq library. This score is the geometric mean of three standard ENCODE quality metrics: the Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF), the PCR Bottleneck Coefficient $1$ (PBC1), and the PCR Bottleneck Coefficient $2$ (PBC2).\n\nFirst, we define and compute each of these three metrics using the provided data.\n\n1.  **Non-Redundant Fraction (NRF)**: This metric quantifies the complexity of the library by measuring the proportion of mapped reads that are unique (non-redundant) in terms of their genomic starting position. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of distinct genomic positions ($N_d$) to the total number of mapped reads ($M$).\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{NRF} = \\frac{N_d}{M}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{NRF} = \\frac{400,000}{1,000,000} = 0.4\n    $$\n\n2.  **PCR Bottleneck Coefficient 1 (PBC1)**: This metric assesses the severity of PCR bottlenecking. It is defined as the ratio of the number of genomic positions with exactly one read ($N_1$) to the total number of distinct genomic positions ($N_d$). A value close to $1$ indicates a highly complex library where most positions are represented by a unique read.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{PBC1} = \\frac{N_1}{N_d}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{PBC1} = \\frac{300,000}{400,000} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n    $$\n\n3.  **PCR Bottleneck Coefficient 2 (PBC2)**: This metric also assesses PCR bottlenecking by comparing the prevalence of positions with unique reads to those with exactly two reads. It is the ratio of the number of positions with one read ($N_1$) to the number of positions with two reads ($N_2$). A high value suggests that single-read positions are much more common than duplicated-read positions, which is desirable.\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{PBC2} = \\frac{N_1}{N_2}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\n    \\mathrm{PBC2} = \\frac{300,000}{50,000} = 6\n    $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the library complexity based on these metrics against commonly used ENCODE guidelines for histone modification ChIP-seq.\n- An NRF of $0.4$ is significantly lower than the recommended threshold of $ 0.8$. This indicates severe library redundancy, with $60\\%$ of reads being PCR duplicates.\n- A PBC1 of $0.75$ is also below the recommended threshold of $ 0.9$. This suggests a moderate PCR bottleneck, where a substantial fraction ($25\\%$) of distinct regions are covered by more than one read.\n- A PBC2 of $6$ is well above the recommended threshold of $ 3$. While this value appears good in isolation, it must be interpreted in the context of the low NRF and PBC1.\n\nOverall, the library quality is poor. The low NRF and PBC1 values are strong indicators of low initial complexity and/or excessive PCR amplification. Such a library would typically be flagged as unacceptable for reliable peak calling, as the high level of duplication can introduce significant bias and lead to the identification of false-positive peaks.\n\nFinally, we compute the composite geometric-mean complexity score $G$ as defined in the problem statement.\n$$\nG = \\big(\\mathrm{NRF}\\times \\mathrm{PBC1}\\times \\mathrm{PBC2}\\big)^{1/3}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the metrics:\n$$\nG = \\big(0.4 \\times 0.75 \\times 6\\big)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nG = \\big(0.3 \\times 6\\big)^{1/3}\n$$\n$$\nG = (1.8)^{1/3}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nG \\approx 1.216440398...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nG \\approx 1.216\n$$",

After sequencing and alignment, the following counts were obtained. In sample A, the number of reads mapping to Drosophila is $2{,}000{,}000$, and in sample B, it is $1{,}000{,}000$. The total number of human-mapped ChIP reads is $48{,}000{,}000$ for sample A and $72{,}000{,}000$ for sample B.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the spike-in-adjusted $\\log_{2}$ fold-change of the histone modification signal at a specific locus in sample B relative to sample A. The calculation proceeds in four steps as outlined by the problem's principles.\n\nFirst, we define the given quantities with their symbolic representation:\n- Drosophila-mapped reads for sample A: $D_A = 2 \\times 10^6$\n- Drosophila-mapped reads for sample B: $D_B = 1 \\times 10^6$\n- Total human-mapped reads for sample A: $H_A = 48 \\times 10^6$\n- Total human-mapped reads for sample B: $H_B = 72 \\times 10^6$\n- Locus-specific human reads for sample A: $L_A = 180$\n- Locus-specific human reads for sample B: $L_B = 210$\n\n1.  **Compute Spike-in Normalization Factors**\nThe normalization factor for a given sample is designed to scale its signal such that the spike-in read count becomes equal to that of the reference sample. Sample A is the designated reference. The normalization factor for the reference sample, $S_A$, is therefore $1$.\n$$S_A = 1$$\nFor sample B, the normalization factor $S_B$ must satisfy the condition $S_B \\times D_B = D_A$. Thus,\n$$S_B = \\frac{D_A}{D_B}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $S_B = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{1 \\times 10^6} = 2$.\n\n2.  **Compute Locus Signal in Reads Per Million (RPM)**\nTo account for differences in sequencing depth (library size) for the human portion of the samples, the locus-specific read count is normalized to the total number of human-mapped reads and expressed in RPM.\nFor sample A, the RPM signal at the locus is:\n$$RPM_{A} = \\frac{L_A}{H_A} \\times 10^6$$\nFor sample B, the RPM signal at the locus is:\n$$RPM_{B} = \\frac{L_B}{H_B} \\times 10^6$$\n\n3.  **Compute Spike-in-Adjusted RPM Signals**\nThe spike-in normalization factor is applied to the RPM-normalized human signal.\nThe adjusted signal for sample A, $Adj\\_RPM_A$, is:\n$$Adj\\_RPM_A = S_A \\times RPM_A = 1 \\times \\left(\\frac{L_A}{H_A} \\times 10^6\\right) = \\frac{L_A \\times 10^6}{H_A}$$\nThe adjusted signal for sample B, $Adj\\_RPM_B$, is:\n$$Adj\\_RPM_B = S_B \\times RPM_B = \\left(\\frac{D_A}{D_B}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{L_B}{H_B} \\times 10^6\\right) = \\frac{D_A \\cdot L_B \\times 10^6}{D_B \\cdot H_B}$$\n\n4.  **Compute the Final $\\log_2$ Fold-Change**\nThe spike-in-adjusted $\\log_{2}$ fold-change of sample B relative to sample A is the base-2 logarithm of the ratio of their adjusted signals.\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{Adj\\_RPM_B}{Adj\\_RPM_A}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions from the previous step:\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{D_A \\cdot L_B \\times 10^6}{D_B \\cdot H_B}}{\\frac{L_A \\times 10^6}{H_A}}\\right) $$\nThe factor of $10^6$ cancels, yielding the simplified general formula:\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{D_A \\cdot L_B \\cdot H_A}{D_B \\cdot L_A \\cdot H_B}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{(2 \\times 10^6) \\cdot 210 \\cdot (48 \\times 10^6)}{(1 \\times 10^6) \\cdot 180 \\cdot (72 \\times 10^6)}\\right) $$\nThe powers of $10$ cancel out:\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{2 \\times 210 \\times 48}{1 \\times 180 \\times 72}\\right) $$\nWe simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{2 \\times 210 \\times 48}{180 \\times 72} = \\frac{420 \\times 48}{180 \\times 72} = \\frac{210 \\times 48}{90 \\times 72} = \\frac{21 \\times 48}{9 \\times 72} $$\nSince $48 = 2 \\times 24$ and $72 = 3 \\times 24$, we can cancel the $24$:\n$$ \\frac{21 \\times 2}{9 \\times 3} = \\frac{42}{27} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $3$:\n$$ \\frac{42 \\div 3}{27 \\div 3} = \\frac{14}{9} $$\nTherefore, the final spike-in-adjusted $\\log_{2}$ fold-change is:\n$$ \\text{log}_2\\text{FC} = \\log_{2}\\left(\\frac{14}{9}\\right) $$\nThis is the required single simplified analytic expression.",
