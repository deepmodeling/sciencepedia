            "introduction": "Beyond simply measuring a peptide's mass, the power of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) lies in its ability to determine the peptide's amino acid sequence. This is achieved by fragmenting the peptide inside the mass spectrometer and measuring the masses of the resulting pieces. This practice  challenges you to derive the mass of a specific type of fragment ion, a $y$-ion, from its chemical definition. This skill is fundamental to understanding how search engines identify peptides and is invaluable for manually interpreting complex fragmentation spectra.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for two deliverables: first, a derivation of the analytic expression for the monoisotopic mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion from first principles; and second, the calculation of this mass for a specific ion ($y_4$) from a given peptide sequence.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the analytic expression for the mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion.\n\nA peptide is a polymer of amino acid residues linked by peptide bonds. Let a peptide of length $L$ be represented by the sequence of its residues $R_1R_2...R_L$, indexed from the N-terminus ($i=1$) to the C-terminus ($i=L$). The chemical structure of a free amino acid is $\\text{H}_2\\text{N-CHR-COOH}$, where $R$ is the side chain. When two amino acids form a peptide bond, a molecule of water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$) is eliminated. Consequently, the mass of an amino acid residue as it exists within a peptide chain, denoted as $m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)$, is the mass of the corresponding free amino acid minus the mass of one water molecule, $m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$. The problem provides these residue masses directly.\n\nTo calculate the neutral mass of any peptide or peptide fragment, we sum the masses of its constituent residues and then add back the mass of one water molecule. This is because the sum of residue masses, $\\sum m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)$, represents a chain of $-\\text{NH-CHR-CO}-$ units, which is missing a terminal hydrogen atom ($\\text{H}$) at the N-terminus and a hydroxyl group ($\\text{OH}$) at the C-terminus compared to a complete, stable peptide molecule. The mass of $\\text{H}$ and $\\text{OH}$ equals the mass of a water molecule, $m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$. Therefore, the neutral monoisotopic mass of a peptide consisting of $k$ residues is given by $\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i)\\right) + m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$.\n\nAccording to the standard nomenclature in mass spectrometry, a $y_n$-ion is a C-terminal fragment of a peptide created by cleavage of a peptide bond. A $y_n$-ion is composed of the last $n$ residues from the C-terminus of the original peptide. For a peptide of length $L$, the $y_n$-ion corresponds to the sequence segment $R_{L-n+1}R_{L-n+2}...R_L$.\n\nThis fragment is itself a small peptide of length $n$. Applying the principle described above, the neutral monoisotopic mass of this $y_n$ fragment, which we denote as $m(y_n)_{\\text{neutral}}$, is the sum of the residue masses of its $n$ constituent amino acids plus the mass of one water molecule.\n$$m(y_n)_{\\text{neutral}} = \\left( \\sum_{i=L-n+1}^{L} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i) \\right) + m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})$$\n\nIn positive-ion mode Electrospray Ionization (ESI), which is a soft ionization technique commonly used in proteomics, charged ions are typically formed by the adduction of one or more protons ($\\mathrm{H}^+$). The problem specifies a singly charged ion ($z=1$). The mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion, denoted $m(y_n^+)$, is therefore the neutral mass of the fragment plus the mass of one proton, $m_p$.\n$$m(y_n^+) = m(y_n)_{\\textneutral} + m_p$$\nSubstituting the expression for the neutral mass, we arrive at the final analytic expression for the monoisotopic mass of a singly charged $y_n$-ion:\n$$m(y_n^+) = \\left( \\sum_{i=L-n+1}^{L} m(\\mathrm{AA}_i) \\right) + m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) + m_p$$\nFor a singly charged ion where the charge state $z=1$, the mass-to-charge ratio ($m/z$) is numerically equal to the ion's mass.\n\nPart 2: Calculation for the $y_4$ ion of peptide $\\mathrm{ACDEKTR}$.\n\nThe given peptide sequence is $\\mathrm{A_1C_2D_3E_4K_5T_6R_7}$.\nThe length of the peptide is $L=7$.\nWe are asked to compute the mass of the $y_4$-ion, so $n=4$.\n\nThe $y_4$-ion consists of the C-terminal $4$ residues. Using the indexing from $i=L-n+1$ to $L$:\nThe starting index is $i = 7-4+1 = 4$.\nThe ending index is $i = 7$.\nThe residues in the $y_4$ fragment are therefore $R_4, R_5, R_6, R_7$, which correspond to the sequence $\\mathrm{EKTR}$.\n\nUsing the derived formula, the mass of the singly charged $y_4$-ion is:\n$$m(y_4^+) = m(\\mathrm{E}) + m(\\mathrm{K}) + m(\\mathrm{T}) + m(\\mathrm{R}) + m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) + m_p$$\n\nWe substitute the given monoisotopic masses:\n- $m(\\mathrm{E}) = 129.04259 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n- $m(\\mathrm{K}) = 128.09496 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n- $m(\\mathrm{T}) = 101.04768 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n- $m(\\mathrm{R}) = 156.10111 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n- $m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) = 18.010565 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n- $m_p = 1.007276 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$\n\nSumming the residue masses:\n$$\\sum m(\\mathrm{residues}) = 129.04259 + 128.09496 + 101.04768 + 156.10111 = 514.28634 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$$\n\nNow, we add the mass of the water molecule and the proton to find the total mass of the ion:\n$$m(y_4^+) = 514.28634 + m(\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) + m_p$$\n$$m(y_4^+) = 514.28634 + 18.010565 + 1.007276$$\n$$m(y_4^+) = 532.296905 + 1.007276$$\n$$m(y_4^+) = 533.304181 \\, \\mathrm{Da}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to $5$ significant figures.\nThe calculated mass is $533.304181$.

When the mass spectrometer isolates precursors with a finite isolation window, co-eluting peptides may be co-isolated. The measured reporter ion intensities then arise from a mixture of the target peptide and one or more interferers. Assume the following physically realistic model, grounded in the linearity of ion production and detection:\n\n- Let the target peptide have true reporter ion intensities $T_1$ and $T_2$ in two TMT channels, with true ratio $R = T_1 / T_2$.\n- Let an interfering peptide be co-isolated and co-fragmented.

Second, we specialize this expression for the case of a non-differentially expressed interferer. Third, we derive the multiplicative bias factor $b$. Finally, we evaluate this factor for the given numerical values.\n\nThe observed ratio $R_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is defined as the ratio of the observed intensities $I_1$ and $I_2$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{I_1}{I_2} = \\frac{S \\left[(1-\\phi) p_1 + \\phi q_1 \\right]}{S \\left[(1-\\phi) p_2 + \\phi q_2 \\right]}$$\nThe total signal intensity $S$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator and thus cancels out:\n$$R_{\\mathrmwhich{obs}} = \\frac{(1-\\phi) p_1 + \\phi q_1}{(1-\\phi) p_2 + \\phi q_2}$$\nThe problem states that the target peptide's reporter distribution fractions $p_1$ and $p_2$ are related to the true ratio $R$ by $p_1 = \\frac{R}{1+R}$ and $p_2 = \\frac{1}{1+R}$.
