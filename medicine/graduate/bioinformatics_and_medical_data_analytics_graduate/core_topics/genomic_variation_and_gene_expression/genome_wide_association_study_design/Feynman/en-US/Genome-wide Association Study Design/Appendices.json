Understanding LD is a double-edged sword: it allows for cost-effective study designs using tag-SNPs to capture information from untyped variants, but it also complicates the identification of true causal variants from a set of correlated signals. This foundational exercise  will give you hands-on practice computing the three most common metrics of LD—the coefficient $D$, the normalized value $D'$, and the squared correlation $r^2$—directly from observed haplotype frequencies, solidifying your understanding of this cornerstone concept.",

A critical variant-level quality control step is testing for Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE), which describes the expected distribution of genotype frequencies in a population under assumptions of random mating. Significant deviation from HWE in a control group can be a red flag for genotyping errors, so this test is essential for filtering out unreliable variants. This practice  walks you through the calculation of the Pearson's chi-squared statistic for HWE from first principles, an indispensable skill for anyone involved in GWAS data processing and interpretation.",

Under the HWE null hypothesis, genotype frequencies are determined by the allele frequencies assuming random mating and no inbreeding.

Testing for HWE is a routine and critical step in the quality control pipeline for Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The setup is scientifically realistic and correct.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data (observed counts, sample size) to perform the required calculations. The statistical procedure and the quantities to be calculated are explicitly defined. The total sample size from the counts is $320+160+20=500$, which is consistent with the stated sample size $N=500$. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first estimating the allele frequencies from the observed data, then calculating the expected genotype counts under the HWE null hypothesis, and finally computing the chi-squared statistic.\n\n**1. Estimation of Allele Frequencies**\nThe total number of individuals in the sample is $N = 320 + 160 + 20 = 500$.\nSince each diploid individual carries two alleles, the total number of alleles in the sample is $2N = 1000$.\n\nThe number of $A$ alleles, $N_A$, is calculated from the genotype counts:\n$$N_A = (2 \\times \\text{count of } AA) + (1 \\times \\text{count of } Aa)$$\n$$N_A = (2 \\times 320) + 160 = 640 + 160 = 800$$\n\nThe number of $a$ alleles, $N_a$, is similarly calculated:\n$$N_a = (2 \\times \\text{count of } aa) + (1 \\times \\text{count of } Aa)$$\n$$N_a = (2 \\times 20) + 160 = 40 + 160 = 200$$\nAs a check, $N_A + N_a = 800 + 200 = 1000 = 2N$.\n\nThe frequencies of alleles $A$ and $a$, denoted by $p$ and $q$ respectively, are estimated from the sample:\n$$p = \\frac{N_A}{2N} = \\frac{800}{1000} = 0.8$$\n$$q = \\frac{N_a}{2N} = \\frac{200}{1000} = 0.2$$\nAs a check, $p+q = 0.8 + 0.2 = 1.0$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Expected Genotype Counts under HWE**\nUnder the HWE null hypothesis, the expected genotype frequencies are $p^2$ for $AA$, $2pq$ for $Aa$, and $q^2$ for $aa$. The expected genotype counts are these frequencies multiplied by the total sample size $N$.\n\nExpected count of $AA$:\n$$E_{AA} = N \\times p^2 = 500 \\times (0.8)^2 = 500 \\times 0.64 = 320$$\n\nExpected count of $Aa$:\n$$E_{Aa} = N \\times 2pq = 500 \\times 2 \\times 0.8 \\times 0.2 = 500 \\times 0.32 = 160$$\n\nExpected count of $aa$:\n$$E_{aa} = N \\times q^2 = 500 \\times (0.2)^2 = 500 \\times 0.04 = 20$$\nAs a check, the sum of expected counts is $320 + 160 + 20 = 500 = N$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Pearson Chi-Squared Statistic**\nThe Pearson chi-squared statistic, $\\chi^2$, is calculated as the sum of the squared differences between observed ($O$) and expected ($E$) counts, each divided by the expected count:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\sum_{i \\in \\{\\text{genotypes}\\}} \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i}$$\nThe observed counts are $O_{AA} = 320$, $O_{Aa} = 160$, and $O_{aa} = 20$.\nThe expected counts are $E_{AA} = 320$, $E_{Aa} = 160$, and $E_{aa} = 20$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{(320 - 320)^2}{320} + \\frac{(160 - 160)^2}{160} + \\frac{(20 - 20)^2}{20}$$\n$$\\chi^2 = \\frac{0^2}{320} + \\frac{0^2}{160} + \\frac{0^2}{20} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$$\nThe computed chi-squared statistic is $\\chi^2 = 0$.\n\n**4. Determination of Degrees of Freedom and p-value**\nFor a chi-squared goodness-of-fit test, the degrees of freedom ($df$) are calculated as:\n$$df = (\\text{number of categories}) - 1 - (\\text{number of estimated parameters})$$\nIn this case, there are $3$ genotype categories ($AA, Aa, aa$). We estimated one parameter from the data, the allele frequency $p$ (since $q$ is determined by $p$ as $q=1-p$).\nTherefore, the degrees of freedom are:\n$$df = 3 - 1 - 1 = 1$$\n\nThe p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. This corresponds to the upper tail of the chi-squared distribution with $1$ degree of freedom.\n$$p = P(\\chi^2_{df=1} \\ge 0)$$\nBy definition, the chi-squared statistic is always non-negative. The probability of obtaining a value greater than or equal to $0$ is $1$.\nThus, the p-value is $p=1$.\n\nThe problem requires determining if $p  10^{-4}$. We must check if $1  10^{-4}$, which is equivalent to checking if $1  0.0001$. This inequality is false.\nTherefore, the indicator variable $D$ is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $[\\chi^2, D] = [0, 0]$.",

A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has minor allele frequency $q_{1} = 0.2$ in $S_{1}$ and $q_{2} = 0.5$ in $S_{2}$. The SNP has no causal effect on the disease, meaning that within each subpopulation the allele is independent of disease status.\n\nThe base population is an equal mixture of the two subpopulations, with mixture weights $w_{1} = 0.5$ and $w_{2} = 0.5$. Controls are sampled from the non-diseased individuals proportionally to their occurrence in the base population (that is, proportional to $w_{i}(1 - \\pi_{i})$ for subpopulation $S_{i}$).

Provide your final answer as an exact value. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the naive allelic odds ratio in a case-control study with population stratification. The analysis will proceed by first determining the minor allele frequency in the pooled case group and the pooled control group, and then using these frequencies to compute the odds ratio.\n\nLet $A$ denote the minor allele and $a$ denote the major allele. The minor allele frequency in subpopulation $S_i$ is $q_i$. The given values are $q_1 = 0.2$ and $q_2 = 0.5$. The disease prevalence in subpopulation $S_i$ is $\\pi_i$, with given values $\\pi_1 = 0.1$ and $\\pi_2 = 0.2$. The base population is an equal mixture of the two subpopulations, with weights $w_1 = w_2 = 0.5$.\n\nThe naive allelic odds ratio, $OR_{naive}$, is defined as the ratio of the odds of the minor allele in the pooled case group to the odds of the minor allele in the pooled control group. Let $q_{case}$ be the frequency of allele $A$ among all cases, and $q_{control}$ be the frequency of allele $A$ among all controls. The odds ratio is given by:\n$$\nOR_{naive} = \\frac{q_{case} / (1 - q_{case})}{q_{control} / (1 - q_{control})}\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to compute $q_{case}$ and $q_{control}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the minor allele frequency in the pooled case group, $q_{case}$. The problem states that the final case group is composed of a fraction $\\alpha_1 = 0.2$ of individuals from subpopulation $S_1$ and a fraction $\\alpha_2 = 0.8$ from subpopulation $S_2$. Thus, $P(S_1|\\text{Case}) = \\alpha_1$ and $P(S_2|\\text{Case}) = \\alpha_2$.\nThe problem states that the SNP has no causal effect, which implies that within each subpopulation, the allele frequency is independent of disease status. Therefore, the allele frequency among cases from subpopulation $S_i$ is simply the allele frequency in that subpopulation, $q_i$.\nUsing the law of total probability, the overall minor allele frequency in the case group is:\n$$\nq_{case} = P(A|\\text{Case}) = P(A|\\text{Case}, S_1)P(S_1|\\text{Case}) + P(A|\\text{Case}, S_2)P(S_2|\\text{Case})\n$$\n$$\nq_{case} = q_1 \\alpha_1 + q_2 \\alpha_2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nq_{case} = (0.2)(0.2) + (0.5)(0.8) = 0.04 + 0.40 = 0.44\n$$\nAs a fraction, $q_{case} = \\frac{44}{100} = \\frac{11}{25}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the minor allele frequency in the pooled control group, $q_{control}$. First, we must determine the composition of the control group. Controls are sampled from the non-diseased individuals proportionally to their occurrence in the base population. The proportion of non-diseased individuals in subpopulation $S_i$ within the total population is proportional to $w_i(1 - \\pi_i)$.\nThe proportion of controls from subpopulation $S_1$, denoted $\\beta_1$, is:\n$$\n\\beta_1 = P(S_1|\\text{Control}) = \\frac{w_1(1 - \\pi_1)}{w_1(1 - \\pi_1) + w_2(1 - \\pi_2)}\n$$\nThe proportion of controls from subpopulation $S_2$, denoted $\\beta_2$, is:\n$$\n\\beta_2 = P(S_2|\\text{Control}) = \\frac{w_2(1 - \\pi_2)}{w_1(1 - \\pi_1) + w_2(1 - \\pi_2)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $w_1=0.5$, $w_2=0.5$, $\\pi_1=0.1$, and $\\pi_2=0.2$:\n$$\n\\beta_1 = \\frac{0.5(1 - 0.1)}{0.5(1 - 0.1) + 0.5(1 - 0.2)} = \\frac{0.5(0.9)}{0.5(0.9) + 0.5(0.8)} = \\frac{0.45}{0.45 + 0.40} = \\frac{0.45}{0.85} = \\frac{45}{85} = \\frac{9}{17}\n$$\nAnd for $\\beta_2$:\n$$\n\\beta_2 = \\frac{0.5(0.8)}{0.85} = \\frac{0.40}{0.85} = \\frac{40}{85} = \\frac{8}{17}\n$$\nAs a check, $\\beta_1 + \\beta_2 = \\frac{9}{17} + \\frac{8}{17} = 1$.\n\nNow, we can find $q_{control}$ using the law of total probability, analogous to the calculation for $q_{case}$:\n$$\nq_{control} = P(A|\\text{Control}) = P(A|\\text{Control}, S_1)P(S_1|\\text{Control}) + P(A|\\text{Control}, S_2)P(S_2|\\text{Control})\n$$\n$$\nq_{control} = q_1 \\beta_1 + q_2 \\beta_2\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $q_i$ and $\\beta_i$:\n$$\nq_{control} = (0.2)\\left(\\frac{9}{17}\\right) + (0.5)\\left(\\frac{8}{17}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{9}{17}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{8}{17}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nq_{control} = \\frac{9}{85} + \\frac{4}{17} = \\frac{9}{85} + \\frac{4 \\times 5}{17 \\times 5} = \\frac{9}{85} + \\frac{20}{85} = \\frac{29}{85}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the naive allelic odds ratio.\nThe odds of the minor allele in cases is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{case} = \\frac{q_{case}}{1 - q_{case}} = \\frac{11/25}{1 - 11/25} = \\frac{11/25}{14/25} = \\frac{11}{14}\n$$\nThe odds of the minor allele in controls is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{control} = \\frac{q_{control}}{1 - q_{control}} = \\frac{29/85}{1 - 29/85} = \\frac{29/85}{56/85} = \\frac{29}{56}\n$$\nThe naive allelic odds ratio is the ratio of these odds:\n$$\nOR_{naive} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{case}}{\\text{Odds}_{control}} = \\frac{11/14}{29/56} = \\frac{11}{14} \\times \\frac{56}{29}\n$$\nSince $56 = 4 \\times 14$, the expression simplifies:\n$$\nOR_{naive} = \\frac{11}{\\cancel{14}} \\times \\frac{4 \\times \\cancel{14}}{29} = \\frac{11 \\times 4}{29} = \\frac{44}{29}\n$$\nThis result, greater than $1$, illustrates how population stratification can induce a spurious association where none exists within the subpopulations.",
