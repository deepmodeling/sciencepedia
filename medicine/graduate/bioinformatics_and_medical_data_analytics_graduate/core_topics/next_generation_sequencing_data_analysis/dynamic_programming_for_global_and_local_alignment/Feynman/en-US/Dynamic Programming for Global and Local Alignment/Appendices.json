Report the optimal global alignment score as your final numeric answer, expressed as an exact integer with no rounding.",
            "solution": "This problem requires the computation of the optimal global alignment score for two deoxyribonucleic acid ($\\text{DNA}$) sequences, $x = \\text{ACG}$ and $y = \\text{AG}$, using a dynamic programming approach, specifically the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. The scoring scheme is defined by a substitution function $s(a,b)$ and a linear gap penalty $d$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem. Let the two sequences be $x = x_1x_2...x_m$ and $y = y_1y_2...y_n$, with lengths $m=3$ and $n=2$, respectively. We are given:\n- Sequence $x = \\text{ACG}$\n- Sequence $y = \\text{AG}$\n- Substitution scores: $s(a,b) = 1$ if $a=b$ (match), and $s(a,b) = -1$ if $a \\neq b$ (mismatch).\n- Linear gap penalty: $d = -2$.\n\nThe core of the dynamic programming solution lies in the principle of optimal substructure. We define a matrix $F$ where the entry $F(i,j)$ represents the score of the optimal global alignment between the prefix of $x$ of length $i$ (denoted $x_{1..i}$) and the prefix of $y$ of length $j$ (denoted $y_{1..j}$). The indices $i$ range from $0$ to $m=3$, and $j$ from $0$ to $n=2$.\n\nAn optimal alignment ending at the pair $(x_i, y_j)$ must be formed by extending a previously found optimal alignment of smaller prefixes. There are three possibilities for the final column of the alignment of $x_{1..i}$ and $y_{1..j}$:\n1.  Align $x_i$ with $y_j$. The score is the score of the optimal alignment of $x_{1..i-1}$ and $y_{1..j-1}$ plus the score for substituting $x_i$ with $y_j$. This gives $F(i-1, j-1) + s(x_i, y_j)$.\n2.  Align $x_i$ with a gap. The score is the score of the optimal alignment of $x_{1..i-1}$ and $y_{1..j}$ plus the gap penalty. This gives $F(i-1, j) + d$.\n3.  Align $y_j$ with a gap. The score is the score of the optimal alignment of $x_{1..i}$ and $y_{1..j-1}$ plus the gap penalty. This gives $F(i, j-1) + d$.\n\nThe optimal score $F(i,j)$ is the maximum of these three values. This yields the fundamental recurrence relation:\n$$F(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} F(i-1, j-1) + s(x_i, y_j) & \\text{(Align } x_i \\text{ and } y_j\\text{)} \\\\ F(i-1, j) + d & \\text{(Align } x_i \\text{ with a gap)} \\\\ F(i, j-1) + d & \\text{(Align } y_j \\text{ with a gap)} \\end{cases}$$\n\nThe boundary conditions are justified from first principles.\n- $F(0,0)$: The score of aligning two empty strings. There are no operations, so the score is $0$. $F(0,0) = 0$.\n- $F(i,0)$ for $i > 0$: The score of aligning the prefix $x_{1..i}$ with an empty string. This can only be achieved by aligning each of the $i$ characters of $x$ with a gap. The total score is the sum of $i$ gap penalties, so $F(i,0) = i \\times d$.\n- $F(0,j)$ for $j > 0$: The score of aligning an empty string with the prefix $y_{1..j}$. This requires $j$ gaps, so the score is $F(0,j) = j \\times d$.\n\nWith $d=-2$, the boundary conditions are:\n$F(0,0) = 0$\n$F(1,0) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$\n$F(2,0) = 2 \\times (-2) = -4$\n$F(3,0) = 3 \\times (-2) = -6$\n$F(0,1) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$\n$F(0,2) = 2 \\times (-2) = -4$\n\nWe now construct and fill the $(3+1) \\times (2+1)$ dynamic programming matrix.\n\n**Matrix Fill Calculation:**\n\n$F(1,1) = \\max(F(0,0) + s(\\text{A},\\text{A}), F(0,1) + d, F(1,0) + d) = \\max(0 + 1, -2 - 2, -2 - 2) = \\max(1, -4, -4) = 1$.\n$F(1,2) = \\max(F(0,1) + s(\\text{A},\\text{G}), F(0,2) + d, F(1,1) + d) = \\max(-2 - 1, -4 - 2, 1 - 2) = \\max(-3, -6, -1) = -1$.\n$F(2,1) = \\max(F(1,0) + s(\\text{C},\\text{A}), F(1,1) + d, F(2,0) + d) = \\max(-2 - 1, 1 - 2, -4 - 2) = \\max(-3, -1, -6) = -1$.\n$F(2,2) = \\max(F(1,1) + s(\\text{C},\\text{G}), F(1,2) + d, F(2,1) + d) = \\max(1 - 1, -1 - 2, -1 - 2) = \\max(0, -3, -3) = 0$.\n$F(3,1) = \\max(F(2,0) + s(\\text{G},\\text{A}), F(2,1) + d, F(3,0) + d) = \\max(-4 - 1, -1 - 2, -6 - 2) = \\max(-5, -3, -8) = -3$.\n$F(3,2) = \\max(F(2,1) + s(\\text{G},\\text{G}), F(2,2) + d, F(3,1) + d) = \\max(-1 + 1, 0 - 2, -3 - 2) = \\max(0, -2, -5) = 0$.\n\nThe complete dynamic programming matrix $F$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|ccc}\n  &   &   & \\text{A} & \\text{G} \\\\\n  & i/j & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n  & 0 & 0 & -2 & -4 \\\\\n\\text{A} & 1 & -2 & 1 & -1 \\\\\n\\text{C} & 2 & -4 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n\\text{G} & 3 & -6 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe optimal global alignment score is the value in the bottom-right cell of the matrix, $F(3,2)$, which is $0$.\n\nTo find an optimal alignment, we perform a traceback from $F(3,2)$ to $F(0,0)$.\n1.  Start at $F(3,2)=0$. This value was derived from $F(2,1) + s(\\text{G},\\text{G}) = -1 + 1 = 0$. This corresponds to a diagonal move, meaning $\\text{G}$ is aligned with $\\text{G}$. We move to $F(2,1)$.\n2.  At $F(2,1)=-1$. This value was derived from $F(1,1) + d = 1 - 2 = -1$. This corresponds to a move from above (a vertical move), meaning $\\text{C}$ is aligned with a gap. We move to $F(1,1)$.\n3.  At $F(1,1)=1$. This value was derived from $F(0,0) + s(\\text{A},\\text{A}) = 0 + 1 = 1$. This corresponds to a diagonal move, meaning $\\text{A}$ is aligned with $\\text{A}$. We move to $F(0,0)$.\n4.  At $F(0,0)$, the traceback terminates.\n\nReconstructing the alignment by reversing the path of the traceback:\n- The move from $F(1,1)$ to $F(0,0)$ gives: $\\text{A}$ aligned with $\\text{A}$.\n- The move from $F(2,1)$ to $F(1,1)$ gives: $\\text{C}$ aligned with a gap ($-$).\n- The move from $F(3,2)$ to $F(2,1)$ gives: $\\text{G}$ aligned with $\\text{G}$.\n\nOne optimal global alignment is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx': \\quad & \\text{A C G} \\\\\ny': \\quad & \\text{A - G}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nLet's verify the score of this alignment: $s(\\text{A},\\text{A}) + d + s(\\text{G},\\text{G}) = 1 + (-2) + 1 = 0$. This score matches the computed value $F(3,2)=0$.\n\nThe final requested answer is the optimal global alignment score.",

In sequence alignment, one seeks to quantify the similarity between two nucleotide sequences under an additive scoring model with linear gap penalties.

Express the final score as an integer without any units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "Local alignment seeks the maximum scoring pair of substrings, one from $x$ and one from $y$, evaluated under an additive scoring system with linear gap penalties. The fundamental base consists of the optimal substructure property and the additive decomposition of alignment scores: any optimal alignment ending at positions $(i,j)$ arises from one of three mutually exclusive elementary extensions—diagonal (a character pair), vertical (a gap in $y$), or horizontal (a gap in $x$)—or is discarded if no extension gives a positive contribution. This is consistent with the principle of dynamic programming (DP) and the Smith–Waterman algorithm (SW) for local alignment.\n\nLet $H(i,j)$ denote the optimal local alignment score of substrings that end at $x_{i}$ and $y_{j}$. Let $s(a,b)$ be the pairwise substitution score: $s(a,b)=+2$ if $a=b$ and $s(a,b)=-1$ if $a\\neq b$. Let the gap penalty be $d=-2$.

Global Alignment with Linear Gap Penalty (Needleman–Wunsch)\n\nThe goal of global alignment, as implemented by the Needleman-Wunsch (NW) algorithm, is to find the highest-scoring alignment that spans the entire length of both sequences.\n\n**DP Formulation:**\nLet $F(i, j)$ be the score of the optimal global alignment of the prefixes $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$. An optimal alignment ending at $(i, j)$ can be formed in one of three ways:\n1.  Aligning $X[i]$ with $Y[j]$ (match/mismatch): The score is $F(i-1, j-1) + s(X[i], Y[j])$.\n2.  Aligning $X[i]$ with a gap: The score is $F(i-1, j) + g$.\n3.  Aligning $Y[j]$ with a gap: The score is $F(i, j-1) + g$.\n\nThe optimal score $F(i, j)$ is the maximum of these possibilities. The recurrence relation is:\n$$F(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} F(i-1, j-1) + s(X[i], Y[j]) \\\\ F(i-1, j) + g \\\\ F(i, j-1) + g \\end{cases}$$\n**Initialization:**\n-   $F(0, 0) = 0$.\n-   $F(i, 0) = i \\times g = -2i$ for $i \\in [1, m]$. This represents aligning the prefix $X[1..i]$ with $i$ gaps.\n-   $F(0, j) = j \\times g = -2j$ for $j \\in [1, n]$. This represents aligning the prefix $Y[1..j]$ with $j$ gaps.\n\n**DP Table Calculation:**\nThe $6 \\times 6$ DP table for $F(i,j)$ is computed as follows. The columns correspond to sequence $Y$ and rows to sequence $X$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n  F(i,j) & - & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} \\\\\n\\hline\n-     & 0   & -2  & -4  & -6  & -8  & -10 \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & -2  & 3   & 1   & -1  & -3  & -5  \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & -4  & 1   & 6   & 4   & 2   & 0   \\\\\n\\texttt{G} & -6  & -1  & 4   & 2   & 0   & -2  \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & -8  & -3  & 2   & 7   & 5   & 3   \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & -10 & -5  & 0   & 5   & 10  & 8   \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Optimal Score:**\nThe optimal global alignment score under the linear model is the value in the bottom-right cell of the matrix.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = F(5, 5) = 8$$\n\n*Justification*: The linear gap penalty of $-2$ is less severe than the mismatch penalty of $-8$. The algorithm finds it optimal to introduce two gaps (one in each sequence) to avoid aligning `G` with `A`. A possible optimal alignment is `AAGAA-` vs `AA-AAA`, with a score of $3+3-2-2+3+3=8$.\n\n### 2. Global Alignment with Affine Gap Penalty (NW with Gotoh's algorithm)\n\nThe affine gap model assigns a high penalty for opening a gap ($g_o$) and a smaller penalty for extending it ($g_e$). The score for a gap of length $k$ is $g_o + (k-1)g_e$.\n\n**DP Formulation:**\nWe use three DP tables to track the state of the alignment:\n-   $M(i, j)$: score of the best alignment of $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$ ending with $X[i]$ aligned to $Y[j]$.\n-   $I_x(i, j)$: score of the best alignment of $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$ ending with $X[i]$ aligned to a gap.\n-   $I_y(i, j)$: score of the best alignment of $X[1..i]$ and $Y[1..j]$ ending with $Y[j]$ aligned to a gap.\n\nThe recurrence relations are:\n$$M(i, j) = s(X[i], Y[j]) + \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_x(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_y(i-1, j-1) \\end{cases}$$\n$$I_x(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j) + g_o \\\\ I_x(i-1, j) + g_e \\end{cases} = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j) - 6 \\\\ I_x(i-1, j) - 1 \\end{cases}$$\n$$I_y(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i, j-1) + g_o \\\\ I_y(i, j-1) + g_e \\end{cases} = \\max \\begin{cases} M(i, j-1) - 6 \\\\ I_y(i, j-1) - 1 \\end{cases}$$\n\n**Initialization:**\n-   $M(0, 0) = 0$; $M(i, j) = -\\infty$ for $i>0$ or $j>0$ on the boundaries.\n-   $I_x(i, 0) = g_o + (i-1)g_e = -6 - (i-1)$ for $i>0$.\n-   $I_y(0, j) = g_o + (j-1)g_e = -6 - (j-1)$ for $j>0$.\n-   All other boundary values for $I_x$ and $I_y$ are $-\\infty$.\n\n**Optimal Score:**\nAfter filling the three matrices, the optimal score is the maximum of the three values in the bottom-right cell. The calculation yields $M(5, 5) = 4$, $I_x(5, 5) = -10$, and $I_y(5, 5) = 0$.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{aff}} = \\max \\{ M(5, 5), I_x(5, 5), I_y(5, 5) \\} = \\max \\{4, -10, 0\\} = 4$$\n\n*Justification*: The gap open penalty $g_o=-6$ is severe. Introducing two separate gaps to avoid the `G/A` mismatch would cost $2 \\times g_o = -12$. This is worse than accepting the mismatch score of $-8$. Therefore, the optimal strategy is a gapless alignment: `AAGAA` vs `AAAAA`. The score is $s(A,A)+s(A,A)+s(G,A)+s(A,A)+s(A,A) = 3+3-8+3+3=4$.\n\n### 3. Local Alignment with Linear Gap Penalty (Smith–Waterman, SW)\n\nLocal alignment finds the highest-scoring sub-alignment between two sequences.\n\n**DP Formulation:**\nThe recurrence is similar to Needleman-Wunsch, but with an added option to start a new alignment anywhere. This is achieved by ensuring the score never drops below zero.\nLet $H(i, j)$ be the score of the optimal local alignment ending at position $(i, j)$.\n$$H(i, j) = \\max \\begin{cases} 0 \\\\ H(i-1, j-1) + s(X[i], Y[j]) \\\\ H(i-1, j) + g \\\\ H(i, j-1) + g \\end{cases}$$\n**Initialization:**\n$H(i, 0) = 0$ for all $i$, and $H(0, j) = 0$ for all $j$.\n\n**DP Table Calculation:**\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccc}\n  H(i,j) & - & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} & \\texttt{A} \\\\\n\\hline\n-     & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & 0 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 3 \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & 0 & 3 & 6 & 6 & 6 & 6 \\\\\n\\texttt{G} & 0 & 1 & 4 & 4 & 4 & 4 \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & 0 & 1 & 4 & 7 & 7 & 7 \\\\\n\\texttt{A} & 0 & 1 & 4 & 7 & 10 & 10 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n**Optimal Score:**\nThe optimal local alignment score is the maximum value found anywhere in the matrix.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = \\max_{i, j} H(i, j) = 10$$\n\n*Justification*: The algorithm identifies the highest-scoring segment. While aligning the `G` from sequence $X$ with an `A` from sequence $Y$ would incur a large mismatch penalty ($-8$), the linear gap penalty is small enough ($-2$) to make it optimal to 'skip' the `G` by introducing a gap. The optimal local alignment aligns the full sequence $X=\\texttt{AAGAA}$ with the substring $Y[1..2]$ followed by $Y[4..5]$, forming the alignment `AAGAA` vs `AA-AA`. The score for this alignment is $s(\\text{A,A})+s(\\text{A,A})+g+s(\\text{A,A})+s(\\text{A,A}) = 3+3-2+3+3=10$. This score is higher than any other substring alignment (e.g., `AA` vs `AA` which scores 6), and is thus the optimal local score.\n\n### 4. Local Alignment with Affine Gap Penalty (SW with Gotoh's algorithm)\n\nThis combines the affine gap model with the local alignment principle.\n\n**DP Formulation:**\nThe recurrences are the same as for global affine alignment, but with the added condition that scores cannot be negative.\n$$M(i, j) = \\max \\left( 0, \\; s(X[i], Y[j]) + \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_x(i-1, j-1) \\\\ I_y(i-1, j-1) \\end{cases} \\right)$$\n$$I_x(i, j) = \\max \\left( 0, \\; \\max \\begin{cases} M(i-1, j) + g_o \\\\ I_x(i-1, j) + g_e \\end{cases} \\right)$$\n$$I_y(i, j) = \\max \\left( 0, \\; \\max \\begin{cases} M(i, j-1) + g_o \\\\ I_y(i, j-1) + g_e \\end{cases} \\right)$$\n**Initialization:**\nAll cells in the first row and first column of all three matrices ($M, I_x, I_y$) are initialized to $0$.\n\n**Optimal Score:**\nThe highest value in any of the three DP tables is the optimal local alignment score. After calculation, the maximum value is found to be 6.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{aff}} = 6$$\n\n*Justification*: The high gap opening penalty ($-6$) makes it unfavorable to bridge the two `AA` segments of $X$ across the central `G`. Any alignment that includes a gap would start with a score of at most $M(i,j) + g_o = 6 - 6 = 0$. Since local alignment scores cannot be negative, the algorithm discards any path that would require opening a costly gap. Instead, it finds the optimal local alignment to be either of the two `AA` segments of $X$ aligned with any `AA` substring from $Y$. The score for this alignment is $s(\\text{A,A}) + s(\\text{A,A}) = 3+3=6$.\n\n### Final Calculation of $\\Delta$\n\nNow we compute the final quantity $\\Delta$ using the four scores:\n- $S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = 8$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{aff}} = 4$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} = 10$\n- $S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{aff}} = 6$\n\n$$\\Delta \\;=\\; \\big(S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} - S_{\\mathrm{global}}^{\\mathrm{aff}}\\big) \\;+\\; \\big(S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{lin}} - S_{\\mathrm{local}}^{\\mathrm{aff}}\\big)$$\n$$\\Delta = (8 - 4) + (10 - 6)$$\n$$\\Delta = 4 + 4 = 8$$",
