            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of an aggregated instrument strength for a set of genetic variants used in a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. This involves two main steps: first, computing the per-variant first-stage $F$-statistic for instrument relevance, and second, aggregating these statistics using a specific precision-weighted averaging scheme.\n\n### Step 1: Per-Variant First-Stage $F$-Statistics\n\nThe first-stage of an MR analysis regresses the exposure, $X$, on a genetic instrument, $G_j$. For a single instrument $j$, the simple linear regression model is:\n$$\nX = \\alpha_j + \\beta_{XG,j} G_j + \\epsilon_j\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{XG,j}$ is the coefficient representing the association between the instrument $G_j$ and the exposure $X$. The problem provides the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of these coefficients, $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}$, and their standard errors, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j})$.\n\nThe relevance of an instrument is assessed by testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_{XG,j} = 0$. In large samples, the Wald test statistic for this hypothesis is the $t$-statistic, calculated as the ratio of the estimate to its standard error:\n$$\nt_j = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j})}\n$$\nFor a simple linear regression with a single predictor, the $F$-statistic for the significance of the regression is the square of the corresponding $t$-statistic:\n$$\nF_j = t_j^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j})} \\right)^2\n$$\nWe compute this value for each of the $5$ variants provided.\n\n- **Variant 1:**\n  $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,1} = 0.06$, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,1}) = 0.012$\n  $$ F_1 = \\left( \\frac{0.06}{0.012} \\right)^2 = 5^2 = 25 $$\n\n- **Variant 2:**\n  $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,2} = 0.04$, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,2}) = 0.010$\n  $$ F_2 = \\left( \\frac{0.04}{0.010} \\right)^2 = 4^2 = 16 $$\n\n- **Variant 3:**\n  $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,3} = 0.03$, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,3}) = 0.015$\n  $$ F_3 = \\left( \\frac{0.03}{0.015} \\right)^2 = 2^2 = 4 $$\n\n- **Variant 4:**\n  $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,4} = 0.09$, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,4}) = 0.008$\n  $$ F_4 = \\left( \\frac{0.09}{0.008} \\right)^2 = (11.25)^2 = 126.5625 $$\n\n- **Variant 5:**\n  $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,5} = 0.05$, $\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,5}) = 0.011$\n  $$ F_5 = \\left( \\frac{0.05}{0.011} \\right)^2 \\approx (4.5454...)^2 \\approx 20.661157 $$\n\n### Step 2: Aggregated Instrument Strength\n\nThe problem specifies that the overall instrument set strength should be calculated as the inverse-variance weighted mean of the per-variant first-stage $F$-statistics. The weight for each variant's contribution is proportional to its precision, which is the inverse of the variance of its exposure association estimate.\n\nLet $F_j$ be the $F$-statistic for variant $j$. The weight $w_j$ is given by:\n$$\nw_j = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j})} = \\frac{1}{(\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}))^2}\n$$\nThe inverse-variance weighted mean of the $F$-statistics, denoted $\\bar{F}_{IVW}$, is then:\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{IVW} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j F_j}{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w_j$ and $F_j$:\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{IVW} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}))^2} \\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}}{\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j})} \\right)^2}{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}))^2}} = \\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}^2}{(\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}))^4}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{5} \\frac{1}{(\\operatorname{SE}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,j}))^2}}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator separately.\n\n**Denominator (Sum of weights):**\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j = \\frac{1}{(0.012)^2} + \\frac{1}{(0.010)^2} + \\frac{1}{(0.015)^2} + \\frac{1}{(0.008)^2} + \\frac{1}{(0.011)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j = \\frac{1}{0.000144} + \\frac{1}{0.0001} + \\frac{1}{0.000225} + \\frac{1}{0.000064} + \\frac{1}{0.000121}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j \\approx 6944.4444 + 10000 + 4444.4444 + 15625 + 8264.4628 \\approx 45278.3517\n$$\n\n**Numerator (Sum of weighted F-statistics):**\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j F_j = \\frac{25}{(0.012)^2} + \\frac{16}{(0.010)^2} + \\frac{4}{(0.015)^2} + \\frac{126.5625}{(0.008)^2} + \\frac{(0.05/0.011)^2}{(0.011)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j F_j \\approx 173611.1111 + 160000 + 17777.7778 + 1977539.0625 + 170756.0959\n$$\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{5} w_j F_j \\approx 2499684.0473\n$$\n\n**Final Calculation:**\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{IVW} = \\frac{2499684.0473}{45278.3517} \\approx 55.20667\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\bar{F}_{IVW} \\approx 55.21\n$$",

            "solution": "The core principle of Mendelian randomization (MR) is to use genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to infer the causal effect of an exposure ($X$) on an outcome ($Y$). Let $\\theta$ be the true causal effect. Under the IV assumptions and assuming linear relationships, the true association of a genetic instrument $i$ with the outcome, $\\beta_{Y,i}$, is proportional to its association with the exposure, $\\beta_{X,i}$, such that $\\beta_{Y,i} = \\theta \\beta_{X,i}$. This holds if the instrument has no direct effect on the outcome that bypasses the exposure, a condition known as the absence of horizontal pleiotropy.\n\n**1. Wald Ratio, Variance, and Inverse-Variance Weights**\n\nFor a single instrument $i$, the ratio of its estimated association with the outcome ($\\beta_{Y,i}$) to its estimated association with the exposure ($\\beta_{X,i}$) provides an estimate of the causal effect. This is the Wald ratio, $r_i$.\n$$\nr_i = \\frac{\\beta_{Y,i}}{\\beta_{X,i}}\n$$\nTo determine the variance of this ratio, $\\operatorname{Var}(r_i)$, we apply the delta method. However, the problem specifies the \"no-measurement-error\" (NOME) assumption for the exposure associations, $\\beta_{X,i}$. This implies that $\\operatorname{Var}(\\beta_{X,i}) \\approx 0$, and $\\beta_{X,i}$ can be treated as a constant. Under this simplifying assumption, the variance of $r_i$ is derived from the variance of $\\beta_{Y,i}$ using standard variance propagation rules:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(r_i) = \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\beta_{Y,i}}{\\beta_{X,i}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\beta_{X,i}^2} \\operatorname{Var}(\\beta_{Y,i})\n$$\nWe are given the standard error of the outcome association, $\\sigma_{Y,i}$, where $\\operatorname{Var}(\\beta_{Y,i}) = \\sigma_{Y,i}^2$. Thus, the variance of the Wald ratio is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(r_i) = \\frac{\\sigma_{Y,i}^2}{\\beta_{X,i}^2}\n$$\nThe inverse-variance weight, $w_i$, for each instrument's ratio estimate is the reciprocal of its variance:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{1}{\\operatorname{Var}(r_i)} = \\frac{\\beta_{X,i}^2}{\\sigma_{Y,i}^2}\n$$\nWe now calculate $r_i$ and $w_i$ for each of the $7$ SNPs.\n\n- SNP $1$: $r_1 = \\frac{0.052}{0.10} = 0.52$. $w_1 = \\frac{0.10^2}{0.010^2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.0001} = 100$.\n- SNP $2$: $r_2 = \\frac{0.060}{0.12} = 0.50$. $w_2 = \\frac{0.12^2}{0.012^2} = \\frac{0.0144}{0.000144} = 100$.\n- SNP $3$: $r_3 = \\frac{0.040}{0.08} = 0.50$. $w_3 = \\frac{0.08^2}{0.010^2} = \\frac{0.0064}{0.0001} = 64$.\n- SNP $4$: $r_4 = \\frac{0.0572}{0.11} = 0.52$. $w_4 = \\frac{0.11^2}{0.011^2} = \\frac{0.0121}{0.000121} = 100$.\n- SNP $5$: $r_5 = \\frac{0.045}{0.09} = 0.50$. $w_5 = \\frac{0.09^2}{0.009^2} = \\frac{0.0081}{0.000081} = 100$.\n- SNP $6$: $r_6 = \\frac{0.130}{0.10} = 1.30$. $w_6 = \\frac{0.10^2}{0.010^2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.0001} = 100$.\n- SNP $7$: $r_7 = \\frac{0.065}{0.13} = 0.50$. $w_7 = \\frac{0.13^2}{0.013^2} = \\frac{0.0169}{0.000169} = 100$.\n\n**2. Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) Estimator**\n\nThe fixed-effect IVW estimator combines the individual Wald ratios by taking their weighted average, where the weights are the inverse variances $w_i$. This method provides the most precise estimate if all instruments are valid (i.e., there is no horizontal pleiotropy).\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{IVW}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{7} w_i r_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{7} w_i}\n$$\nThe sum of the weights is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{7} w_i = 100 + 100 + 64 + 100 + 100 + 100 + 100 = 664\n$$\nThe weighted sum of the ratios is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{7} w_i r_i = (100 \\times 0.52) + (100 \\times 0.50) + (64 \\times 0.50) + (100 \\times 0.52) + (100 \\times 0.50) + (100 \\times 1.30) + (100 \\times 0.50)\n$$\n$$\n= 52 + 50 + 32 + 52 + 50 + 130 + 50 = 416\n$$\nThe IVW estimate is therefore:\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{IVW}} = \\frac{416}{664} \\approx 0.626506...\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{IVW}} = 0.6265$.\n\n**3. Weighted Median (WM) Estimator**\n\nThe weighted median estimator provides a consistent causal estimate if at least $50\\%$ of the weight in the analysis comes from valid instruments. It is robust to pleiotropic outliers. To find the weighted median, we first sort the individual ratio estimates $r_i$ and then find the value at which the cumulative sum of weights reaches $50\\%$ of the total weight.\n\nThe ordered pairs of $(r_i, w_i)$ are:\n$(0.50, 100)$, $(0.50, 64)$, $(0.50, 100)$, $(0.50, 100)$, $(0.52, 100)$, $(0.52, 100)$, $(1.30, 100)$.\nThe total weight is $\\sum w_i = 664$. The halfway point is $\\frac{664}{2} = 332$.\nWe compute the cumulative sum of weights for the ordered ratios:\n- For $r_i = 0.50$: cumulative weight is $100 + 64 + 100 + 100 = 364$.\nSince this cumulative weight ($364$) is the first to exceed the halfway point ($332$), the weighted median is the corresponding ratio value.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WM}} = 0.50\n$$\nTo be reported to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WM}} = 0.5000$.\n\n**4. Weighted Mode (WMode) Estimator**\n\nThe weighted mode estimator is based on the principle that the a valid causal estimate should be supported by a plurality of instruments. The problem defines a simplified \"zero-bandwidth\" version: the value of $r_i$ corresponding to the group of instruments with the largest sum of weights. We group the instruments by their exact $r_i$ value and sum the weights within each group.\n\n- Group $r=0.50$: SNPs $\\{2, 3, 5, 7\\}$. Total weight = $w_2 + w_3 + w_5 + w_7 = 100 + 64 + 100 + 100 = 364$.\n- Group $r=0.52$: SNPs $\\{1, 4\\}$. Total weight = $w_1 + w_4 = 100 + 100 = 200$.\n- Group $r=1.30$: SNP $\\{6\\}$. Total weight = $w_6 = 100$.\n\nThe largest aggregated weight is $364$, which corresponds to the ratio value $r=0.50$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WMode}} = 0.50\n$$\nTo be reported to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WMode}} = 0.5000$.\n\n**Interpretation of Discrepancy**\n\nThe three estimates are $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{IVW}} = 0.6265$, $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WM}} = 0.5000$, and $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WMode}} = 0.5000$. The notable discrepancy between the IVW estimate and the robust median and mode estimates is a strong indicator of violations of the MR assumptions, specifically the presence of directional horizontal pleiotropy. The IVW estimator assumes all instruments are valid and is therefore sensitive to outliers. The ratio for SNP $6$ ($r_6 = 1.30$) is a significant outlier compared to the others, which cluster around $0.50$. Since the IVW is a weighted average, this pleiotropic outlier, which has a large weight ($w_6=100$), biases the estimate upwards. In contrast, the weighted median and weighted mode estimators are robust to such outliers. They both provide an estimate of $0.5000$, suggesting that the largest cluster of instruments, comprising over $50\\%$ of the total weight, consistently points to a causal effect of this magnitude. The agreement between the median and mode estimators reinforces the conclusion that the true causal effect is likely close to $0.50$ and that the IVW estimate is biased due to pleiotropy from at least one instrument (SNP $6$).\n\nFinal Numerical Results (4 significant figures):\n- $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{IVW}} \\approx 0.6265$\n- $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WM}} = 0.5000$\n- $\\hat{\\theta}_{\\mathrm{WMode}} = 0.5000$",

Derivation of the Inverse-Variance Weighted (IVW) Estimator**\n\nIn Mendelian randomization, each genetic variant (SNP) $G_i$ that is a valid instrument for an exposure $X$ but not associated with confounders of the $X-Y$ relationship allows for an estimation of the causal effect $\\beta$ of $X$ on an outcome $Y$. The fundamental instrumental variable (IV) relationship for SNP $i$ is:\n$$\n\\beta_{YG,i} = \\beta \\times \\beta_{XG,i}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{YG,i}$ is the true effect of the SNP on the outcome and $\\beta_{XG,i}$ is the true effect of the SNP on the exposure. This implies that the causal effect $\\beta$ can be estimated as the ratio of these two effects.\n\nUsing the summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), we can form a ratio estimate for each SNP $i$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_i = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}}{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}$ are the estimated effects. To combine these $m$ individual estimates into a single, more precise estimate, we use inverse-variance weighting. This requires the variance (or standard error) of each $\\hat{\\beta}_i$.\n\nWe derive this variance using the delta method. For a function $f(a,b) = a/b$, the variance of $f(\\hat{a}, \\hat{b})$ is approximately:\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\hat{a}}{\\hat{b}}\\right) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{a}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(\\hat{b}) + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial b}\\right) \\text{Cov}(\\hat{a}, \\hat{b})\n$$\nEvaluated at the true values $(a, b)$, the partial derivatives are $\\frac{1}{b}$ and $-\\frac{a}{b^2}$. Substituting these, we get:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\beta_{XG,i}^2}\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}) + \\frac{\\beta_{YG,i}^2}{\\beta_{XG,i}^4}\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}) - 2\\frac{\\beta_{YG,i}}{\\beta_{XG,i}^3}\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}, \\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i})\n$$\nThe problem specifies a two-sample MR context with independent GWAS, so we assume $\\text{Cov}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}, \\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}) = 0$. Furthermore, it requires assuming No Measurement Error (NOME) for $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}$. This assumption implies that the variance of the SNP-exposure effect, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i})$, is treated as zero. This simplifies the variance of the ratio estimate considerably:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_i) \\approx \\frac{1}{\\beta_{XG,i}^2}\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i})\n$$\nUsing the available estimates, the variance for $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ is approximated as:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_i) = \\frac{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}\n$$\nThe optimal weight for each estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_i$ in an IVW meta-analysis is the inverse of its variance:\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\beta}_i)} = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}\n$$\nThe IVW estimator, $\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW}$, is the weighted mean of the individual ratio estimates:\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i \\hat{\\beta}_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^m w_i} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m \\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}}{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}}\\right)}{\\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the final form of the IVW estimator used for calculation. This estimator is equivalent to the slope of a weighted linear regression of $\\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}$ on $\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}$ with the intercept constrained to zero and weights $1/\\sigma_{YG,i}^2$.\n$$\n\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i} \\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}}\n$$\n\n**2. Identification of Outlier Instruments**\n\nThe problem provides per-SNP contributions, $q_i$, to Cochran's $Q$ statistic for heterogeneity. An instrument is flagged as a potential outlier if its contribution $q_i$ exceeds the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold. The critical value is given as $\\chi^{2}_{1,\\,1-\\alpha^{\\ast}} = 7.879$ for $\\alpha^{\\ast} = 0.05 / 8 = 0.00625$.\n\nWe compare each $q_i$ to this critical value:\n- $q_1 = 0.573 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_2 = 0.305 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_3 = 0.431 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_4 = 0.734 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_5 = 0.021 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_6 = 0.709 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_7 = 0.146 < 7.879$ (Not an outlier)\n- $q_8 = 14.518 > 7.879$ (Outlier)\n\nBased on this analysis, SNP $8$ is the only instrument flagged as a statistical outlier.\n\n**3. Calculation of IVW Estimate with All Instruments ($m=8$)**\n\nWe compute the numerator and denominator of the $\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW}$ formula.\nThe numerator is $\\sum_{i=1}^8 \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i} \\hat{\\beta}_{YG,i}}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}$:\n- SNP 1: $\\frac{0.20 \\times 0.082}{0.020^2} = \\frac{0.0164}{0.0004} = 41.0$\n- SNP 2: $\\frac{0.12 \\times 0.050}{0.015^2} = \\frac{0.006}{0.000225} = 26.666...$\n- SNP 3: $\\frac{0.25 \\times 0.105}{0.025^2} = \\frac{0.02625}{0.000625} = 42.0$\n- SNP 4: $\\frac{0.18 \\times 0.072}{0.018^2} = \\frac{0.01296}{0.000324} = 40.0$\n- SNP 5: $\\frac{0.30 \\times 0.150}{0.030^2} = \\frac{0.045}{0.0009} = 50.0$\n- SNP 6: $\\frac{0.22 \\times 0.090}{0.020^2} = \\frac{0.0198}{0.0004} = 49.5$\n- SNP 7: $\\frac{0.10 \\times 0.044}{0.012^2} = \\frac{0.0044}{0.000144} = 30.555...$\n- SNP 8: $\\frac{0.15 \\times 0.130}{0.015^2} = \\frac{0.0195}{0.000225} = 86.666...$\nSum of numerators = $41.0 + 26.666... + 42.0 + 40.0 + 50.0 + 49.5 + 30.555... + 86.666... = 366.388...$\n\nThe denominator is $\\sum_{i=1}^8 \\frac{\\hat{\\beta}_{XG,i}^2}{\\sigma_{YG,i}^2}$:\n- SNP 1: $\\frac{0.20^2}{0.020^2} = 100.0$\n- SNP 2: $\\frac{0.12^2}{0.015^2} = \\frac{0.0144}{0.000225} = 64.0$\n- SNP 3: $\\frac{0.25^2}{0.025^2} = 100.0$\n- SNP 4: $\\frac{0.18^2}{0.018^2} = 100.0$\n- SNP 5: $\\frac{0.30^2}{0.030^2} = 100.0$\n- SNP 6: $\\frac{0.22^2}{0.020^2} = \\frac{0.0484}{0.0004} = 121.0$\n- SNP 7: $\\frac{0.10^2}{0.012^2} = \\frac{0.01}{0.000144} = 69.444...$\n- SNP 8: $\\frac{0.15^2}{0.015^2} = 100.0$\nSum of denominators = $100.0 + 64.0 + 100.0 + 100.0 + 100.0 + 121.0 + 69.444... + 100.0 = 754.444...$\n\n$\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW, \\text{all}} = \\frac{366.388...}{754.444...} = 0.4856406... \\approx 0.4856$\n\n**4. Calculation of IVW Estimate after Outlier Removal ($m=7$)**\n\nWe recompute the sums excluding SNP $8$.\nNew numerator sum = (Total sum) - (Term for SNP 8) = $366.388... - 86.666... = 279.722...$\nNew denominator sum = (Total sum) - (Term for SNP 8) = $754.444... - 100.0 = 654.444...$\n\n$\\hat{\\beta}_{IVW, \\text{no-outlier}} = \\frac{279.722...}{654.444...} = 0.42741935... \\approx 0.4274$\n\n**5. Qualitative Assessment of Estimate Stability**\n\nThe IVW causal estimate using all $8$ SNPs is $\\hat{\\beta} \\approx 0.4856$. After removing the single outlier, SNP $8$, the estimate becomes $\\hat{\\beta} \\approx 0.4274$. This represents a decrease of approximately $12\\%$ from the initial value. The significant change in the estimate after removing just one of the $m=8$ instruments indicates that the original estimate was not stable and was highly influenced by the outlier. The individual ratio estimate for SNP $8$ is $\\hat{\\beta}_8 = 0.130/0.150 \\approx 0.867$, which is substantially higher than the ratio estimates for the other SNPs (which mostly range from $0.40$ to $0.44$). The high $q_8$ value correctly identified this SNP as being highly pleiotropic or otherwise invalid, as its effect ratio deviates significantly from the consensus of the other instruments. The large upward bias it exerted on the original estimate is now corrected. The revised estimate of $0.4274$ is more robust and likely a more accurate reflection of the true causal effect, assuming the remaining $7$ SNPs satisfy the IV assumptions.\n\nFinal numerical results rounded to four significant figures are:\n- IVW estimate with all SNPs: $0.4856$\n- IVW estimate without outlier SNP 8: $0.4274$",
