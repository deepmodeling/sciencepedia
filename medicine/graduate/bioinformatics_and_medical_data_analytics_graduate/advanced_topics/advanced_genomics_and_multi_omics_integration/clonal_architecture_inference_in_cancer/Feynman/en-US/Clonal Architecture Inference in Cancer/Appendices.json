The sample contains a mixture of cancer cells and normal cells. The Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF), denoted $f$, is defined as the fraction of cancer cells that carry the mutation. The sample purity, denoted $p$, is the fraction of cells in the sample that are cancerous. The locus has total copy number $C$ in cancer cells, and the mutation multiplicity $m$ is the number of allelic copies that carry the mutation in cancer cells that harbor it.\n\nAssume the following:\n- Normal cells at this locus are diploid and contribute $2$ total alleles per cell.\n- Cancer cells at this locus have total copy number $C$ and, among the cancer cells, a fraction $f$ carry the mutation.\n- Each mutated cancer cell carries the mutation on $m$ allelic copies at that locus.\n- Sequencing is unbiased, and the observed VAF equals the expected fraction of mutated alleles in the mixed DNA pool under large depth.\n\nStarting from first principles using allele counting in a two-compartment mixture (normal and cancer), derive an expression that relates the expected VAF to $p$, $C$, $m$, and $f$, and solve for $f$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the Cancer Cell Fraction, $f$, based on a two-compartment model of a tumor sample, and then to compute its value for a given set of parameters. The derivation will proceed from first principles by considering the allelic contributions of the normal and cancerous cell populations within the sample.\n\nLet us consider a representative tissue sample containing a total of $N_{\\text{total}}$ cells. The sample purity, $p$, is the fraction of cells that are cancerous.\nThe number of cancer cells in the sample is $N_{\\text{cancer}} = p \\cdot N_{\\text{total}}$.\nThe number of normal cells in the sample is $N_{\\text{normal}} = (1-p) \\cdot N_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe expected Variant Allele Frequency, $VAF_{\\text{exp}}$, is the ratio of the number of mutated alleles to the total number of alleles at the specified locus within the entire sample. We must calculate both quantities.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of alleles, $A_{\\text{total}}$, in the sample.\nNormal cells are diploid, so each normal cell contributes $2$ alleles at the locus. The total contribution from normal cells is $N_{\\text{normal}} \\times 2 = (1-p) N_{\\text{total}} \\times 2$.\nCancer cells have a total copy number of $C$ at this locus. The total contribution from cancer cells is $N_{\\text{cancer}} \\times C = p N_{\\text{total}} \\times C$.\nThe total number of alleles in the sample is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\nA_{\\text{total}} = 2(1-p)N_{\\text{total}} + C p N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{total}} [2(1-p) + C p]\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the total number of mutated alleles, $A_{\\text{mutated}}$.\nNormal cells are assumed not to carry the somatic mutation, so their contribution to the mutated allele count is $0$.\nThe mutation is present only in a fraction $f$ (the Cancer Cell Fraction) of the cancer cells.\nThe number of cancer cells that carry the mutation is $N_{\\text{mutated\\_cancer}} = f \\cdot N_{\\text{cancer}} = f \\cdot p \\cdot N_{\\text{total}}$.\nIn each of these mutated cancer cells, the mutation is present on $m$ allelic copies (the mutation multiplicity).\nTherefore, the total number of mutated alleles in the sample is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{mutated}} = N_{\\text{mutated\\_cancer}} \\times m = (f \\cdot p \\cdot N_{\\text{total}}) \\cdot m = f p m N_{\\text{total}}\n$$\n\nThe expected VAF is the ratio of $A_{\\text{mutated}}$ to $A_{\\text{total}}$.\n$$\nVAF_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{mutated}}}{A_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{f p m N_{\\text{total}}}{N_{\\text{total}} [2(1-p) + C p]}\n$$\nThe term $N_{\\text{total}}$ cancels, yielding the general expression relating the expected VAF to the model parameters:\n$$\nVAF_{\\text{exp}} = \\frac{f p m}{2(1-p) + C p}\n$$\nThe problem states that the observed VAF can be equated with the expected VAF. Let $VAF$ denote $VAF_{\\text{exp}}$.\n$$\nVAF = \\frac{f p m}{2(1-p) + C p}\n$$\nWe are asked to solve this equation for the Cancer Cell Fraction, $f$. To do this, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\nVAF \\cdot [2(1-p) + C p] = f p m\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{VAF \\cdot [2(1-p) + C p]}{p m}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for $f$.\n\nNow, we compute the value of $f$ using the provided data: observed $VAF = 0.18$, sample purity $p=0.7$, total copy number in cancer cells $C=3$, and mutation multiplicity $m=1$.\nTo maintain precision, we will use fractional representations for the decimal values:\n$VAF = 0.18 = \\frac{18}{100} = \\frac{9}{50}$\n$p = 0.7 = \\frac{7}{10}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{9}{50} \\cdot [2(1-\\frac{7}{10}) + 3 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10}]}{\\frac{7}{10} \\cdot 1}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the term in the square brackets:\n$$\n1-\\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{3}{10}\n$$\n$$\n2\\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) + 3\\left(\\frac{7}{10}\\right) = \\frac{6}{10} + \\frac{21}{10} = \\frac{27}{10}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\frac{9}{50} \\cdot \\frac{27}{10}}{\\frac{7}{10}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this complex fraction:\n$$\nf = \\frac{9}{50} \\cdot \\frac{27}{10} \\cdot \\frac{10}{7}\n$$\nThe factor of $10$ in the numerator and denominator cancels:\n$$\nf = \\frac{9}{50} \\cdot \\frac{27}{7}\n$$\nFinally, we perform the multiplication:\n$$\nf = \\frac{9 \\times 27}{50 \\times 7} = \\frac{243}{350}\n$$\nTo confirm this fraction is in its simplest form, we note the prime factorization of the numerator is $243 = 3^5$ and the denominator is $350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7$.

            "problem": "A single bulk tumor sequencing sample has known purity $p=0.7$ (fraction of cancer cells in the sample). For each somatic single-nucleotide variant, you are given the alternate and reference read counts and the local allele-specific copy numbers inferred from segmentation: total copy number $C_{t}$ and minor-allele copy number $C_{m}$. Assume the normal cell population has total copy number $2$ at all loci, the sequencing is unbiased, and the locus-level tumor copy number applies uniformly across cancer cells containing or not containing the variant. Let the variant be present in a fraction $c$ of cancer cells (the Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF)), and let the multiplicity $m$ denote the number of mutated copies per cancer cell carrying the variant. The Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) is defined as the fraction of sequencing reads supporting the alternate allele: $v = \\frac{a}{a+r}$, where $a$ and $r$ are the alternate and reference read counts, respectively.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the mixture model of tumor and normal cells, derive the mapping from observed VAF $v$ to CCF $c$ as a function of $p$, $C_{t}$, and $m$. Then, for each variant below, compute the adjusted CCF by inverting that mapping using the observed $v$ and choosing the smallest integer multiplicity $m$ such that $1 \\leq m \\leq C_{\\mathrm{maj}}$ and the resulting $c$ lies in the interval $[0,1]$, where $C_{\\mathrm{maj}} = C_{t} - C_{m}$ is the major-allele copy number. If no such $m$ yields $c \\in [0,1]$, choose the smallest $m$ that minimizes the absolute deviation of $c$ from $1$.\n\nAfter computing the adjusted CCFs, assign each variant to one of two clusters defined by fixed CCF centers: a clonal cluster with center $1.0$ and a dominant subclonal cluster with center $0.35$. Use nearest-center assignment in absolute difference $|c - \\text{center}|$, breaking ties in favor of the clonal cluster ($1.0$).\n\nThe five variants are:\n- Variant $1$: $a_{1}=45, r_{1}=55, C_{t,1}=3, C_{m,1}=1$.\n- Variant $2$: $a_{2}=40, r_{2}=80, C_{t,2}=2, C_{m,2}=1$.\n- Variant $3$: $a_{3}=20, r_{3}=80, C_{t,3}=4, C_{m,3}=1$.\n- Variant $4$: $a_{4}=25, r_{4}=75, C_{t,4}=3, C_{m,4}=0$.\n- Variant $5$: $a_{5}=20, r_{5}=80, C_{t,5}=5, C_{m,5}=2$.\n\nExpress each CCF as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The final answer must be given as a single row matrix with the first five entries being the rounded CCFs for Variants $1$ through $5$ in order, followed by the five cluster assignments encoded as integers ($1$ for the clonal cluster and $2$ for the dominant subclonal cluster).",
