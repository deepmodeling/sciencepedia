All provided definitions are standard and correct within this field.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The setup is sufficient to determine a unique analytical solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the evolutionary distance $d$ in terms of the observed proportion of differing sites $p$. This requires establishing a relationship between each of these quantities and the underlying parameters of the JC model, which are the substitution rate parameter $\\alpha$ and the total time $\\tau$.\n\nFirst, we determine the average rate of substitution per site, $\\mu$. By definition, $\\mu = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i (-Q_{ii})$.\nThe problem provides the stationary distribution $\\pi_i = \\frac{1}{4}$ for all $4$ nucleotide states $i \\in \\{A, C, G, T\\}$.\nThe diagonal elements of the rate matrix are given as $Q_{ii} = -3\\alpha$.\nTherefore, the rate $\\mu$ is:\n$$ \\mu = \\sum_{i \\in \\{A,C,G,T\\}} \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) (-(-3\\alpha)) = 4 \\times \\frac{3\\alpha}{4} = 3\\alpha $$\nThe evolutionary distance $d$, defined as the expected number of substitutions per site, is given by $d = \\mu \\tau$. Substituting the expression for $\\mu$, we have:\n$$ d = 3\\alpha\\tau $$\n\nNext, we must find an expression for $p$, the expected fraction of nucleotide differences. For a time-reversible Markov model such as JC, the probability of observing a difference between two sequences separated by a total branch length of $\\tau$ is equivalent to the probability that a single sequence will change its state over a time interval $\\tau$. Let us assume the process starts at equilibrium, meaning the initial nucleotide is drawn from the stationary distribution $\\pi$. The probability of a difference is then the probability of starting in any state $i$ and ending in any other state $j \\neq i$ after time $\\tau$.\n$$ p = \\sum_{i} \\pi_i \\left( \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) \\right) $$\nDue to the symmetry of the JC model, the probability of changing from state $i$ to any other state is independent of the starting state $i$. That is, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau)$ is the same for all $i$. Since $\\sum_i \\pi_i = 1$, the expression for $p$ simplifies to:\n$$ p = \\sum_{j \\neq i} P_{ij}(\\tau) = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) $$\nfor any arbitrarily chosen state $i$.\n\nWe must now determine the transition probability $P_{ii}(\\tau)$. The transition matrix $P(t)$ is the solution to the master equation $\\frac{d P(t)}{dt} = P(t) Q_{JC}$ with initial condition $P(0) = I$, the identity matrix. It is simpler to solve for the probability vector. Let $p_k(t)$ be the probability of being in state $k$ at time $t$. Consider a sequence starting in state $i$ at $t=0$. The change in probability of remaining in state $i$ is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{k} p_k(t) Q_{ki} $$\nUsing the specific entries of the JC matrix, with $p_i(0)=1$ and $p_j(0)=0$ for $j \\neq i$:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = p_i(t) Q_{ii} + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) Q_{ji} = p_i(t)(-3\\alpha) + \\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) \\alpha $$\nSince the probabilities must sum to unity, $\\sum_{j \\neq i} p_j(t) = 1 - p_i(t)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i(t)}{dt} = -3\\alpha p_i(t) + \\alpha(1 - p_i(t)) = \\alpha - 4\\alpha p_i(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it using an integrating factor or by separation of variables. Let us rearrange to find the solution:\n$$ \\frac{dp_i}{dt} + 4\\alpha p_i = \\alpha $$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$, and a particular solution. For the particular solution, we try a constant $p_i = K$, which gives $4\\alpha K = \\alpha$, so $K = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThe general solution is $p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(-4\\alpha t)$.\nWe apply the initial condition $p_i(0) = 1$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1}{4} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nThus, the probability of remaining in the same state after time $t$ is:\n$$ P_{ii}(t) = p_i(t) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha t) $$\nNow we can compute $p$ by substituting $t=\\tau$:\n$$ p = 1 - P_{ii}(\\tau) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) $$\n$$ p = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau) \\right) $$\n\nWe have established two relations:\n1. $d = 3\\alpha \\tau$\n2. $p = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - \\exp(-4\\alpha \\tau))$\n\nOur goal is to express $d$ as a function of $p$. From equation (1), we have $\\alpha \\tau = \\frac{d}{3}$. We can substitute this into equation (2):\n$$ p = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-4 \\left(\\frac{d}{3}\\right)\\right) \\right) = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) \\right) $$\nNow, we must invert this expression to solve for $d$.\n$$ \\frac{4p}{3} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4d}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4p}{3} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -\\frac{4d}{3} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right) $$\nFinally, solving for $d$:\n$$ d = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right) $$\nThis is the Jukes-Cantor distance formula, which corrects the observed proportion of differences $p$ to estimate the actual number of substitutions that have occurred per site. Note that the argument of the logarithm requires $1 - \\frac{4p}{3} > 0$, which implies $p < \\frac{3}{4}$. This is expected, as at infinite time ($\\tau \\to \\infty$), the probability of any nucleotide at a site becomes $\\frac{1}{4}$, so the probability of a mismatch $p$ approaches $\\frac{3}{4}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically valid and well-posed. It presents a standard, calculable scenario in molecular evolution using the Jukes-Cantor model, with all necessary information provided and no internal contradictions or scientific flaws.\n\nThe Jukes-Cantor $1969$ (JC69) model is a model of nucleotide substitution that assumes equal base frequencies (i.e., $\\pi_A = \\pi_C = \\pi_G = \\pi_T = 1/4$) and equal substitution rates between any pair of distinct nucleotides.\n\nUnder this model, the probability $p$ of observing a difference at a single nucleotide site between two sequences that have diverged for a time corresponding to an evolutionary distance $d$ is given by the formula:\n$$ p(d) = \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{4}{3}d} \\right) $$\nHere, the distance $d$ is defined as the expected number of substitutions per site that have occurred along the two lineages since their divergence from a common ancestor.\n\nThe problem provides an observed proportion of differences, $\\hat{p} = 0.75$, based on a Hamming distance of $75$ sites in sequences of length $100$. To estimate the evolutionary distance, $\\hat{d}$, we must invert the JC69 formula, treating the observed proportion $\\hat{p}$ as an estimate of the true probability $p$:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3}\\hat{p} \\right) $$\nThis is the JC69 distance correction formula.\n\nWe substitute the given value $\\hat{p} = 0.75$ into this equation:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\times 0.75 \\right) $$\nRecognizing that $0.75$ is equal to $3/4$:\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln \\left( 1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\times \\frac{3}{4} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln (1 - 1) $$\n$$ \\hat{d} = -\\frac{3}{4} \\ln(0) $$\nThe natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, approaches $-\\infty$ as its argument $x$ approaches $0$ from the positive side. Therefore, the estimated distance $\\hat{d}$ is:\n$$ \\hat{d} \\to -\\frac{3}{4} \\times (-\\infty) \\to +\\infty $$\nThe estimated JC69 distance is infinite.\n\nThis result arises because the proportion of observable differences $p$ approaches a saturation limit as the true distance $d$ increases. Taking the limit of $p(d)$ as $d \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{d \\to \\infty} p(d) = \\lim_{d \\to \\infty} \\frac{3}{4} \\left( 1 - e^{-\\frac{4}{3}d} \\right) $$\nAs $d \\to \\infty$, the term $e^{-\\frac{4}{3}d} \\to 0$. Thus:\n$$ \\lim_{d \\to \\infty} p(d) = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - 0) = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75 $$\nThe maximum possible proportion of differences that can be observed under the JC69 model is $0.75$. This is the saturation limit. At this point, the sequences have diverged so much that for any given site, the nucleotide in one sequence is random with respect to the other, with a $1/4$ chance of being the same and a $3/4$ chance of being different. When the observed proportion of differences $\\hat{p}$ reaches this theoretical maximum, the model infers that an infinite number of substitutions must have occurred to reach this state of randomization.\n\nPhylogenetically, this implies that the sequences are saturated with substitutions. Multiple substitutions at the same site have occurred, obscuring the true evolutionary history. The observed distance no longer reflects the true distance, and any phylogenetic signal that could be used to reliably infer the relationship between the two sequences has been erased. The sequences are so diverged they appear random relative to each other.\n\nNow, we evaluate the provided options:\n\nA. The JC69-corrected distance is infinite because $\\hat{p} = 0.75$ equals the JC69 saturation limit, so the inferred number of substitutions per site must be unbounded to produce that much observed divergence; this implies the sequences are effectively saturated (approaching randomization), and pairwise comparisons provide little reliable phylogenetic signal about their relationship.\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly identifies that $\\hat{p} = 0.75$ is the saturation limit, correctly concludes the distance is infinite, and accurately describes the implication of saturation, which is the loss of reliable phylogenetic signal.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. The JC69-corrected distance is undefined because the model does not allow more than a proportion $0.50$ of differences; this implies the sequences are not homologous and cannot be used for phylogenetic inference.\nThis statement is incorrect. The saturation limit for JC69 is $0.75$, not $0.50$. The distance is not \"undefined\" but rather infinite, which is a well-defined mathematical limit. Furthermore, high divergence (saturation) does not disprove homology; the problem explicitly states the sequences are homologous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The JC69-corrected distance is finite (approximately $1.5$ substitutions per site), implying the sequences are distantly related but their relationship can still be reliably resolved from pairwise distances.\nThis statement is incorrect. As calculated, the distance is infinite, not finite. A finite distance of $\\hat{d} = 1.5$ would correspond to an observed difference proportion of $p = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - e^{-4/3 \\times 1.5}) = \\frac{3}{4} (1 - e^{-2}) \\approx 0.75 \\times (1 - 0.1353) \\approx 0.6485$, which is not $0.75$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. The JC69-corrected distance is infinite because unequal base frequencies force divergence estimates to diverge; this implies that using a General Time Reversible (GTR) model would yield a small finite distance, so the sequences are closely related.\nThis statement is incorrect for multiple reasons. First, the JC69 model assumes *equal* base frequencies, so the premise is false. The infinite distance is a feature of the model reaching its saturation limit, not a result of violating its assumptions. Second, there is no guarantee that a more complex GTR model would yield a small, finite distance; if the sequences are genuinely very divergent, a GTR model would also estimate a very large distance. Concluding they are \"closely related\" is contrary to the evidence of extreme divergence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The supplied problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established HKY85 model of nucleotide substitution, mathematically well-posed with all necessary data provided, and formulated with objective and unambiguous language. The task is a standard computational problem in molecular evolution, requiring the application of linear algebra and the theory of continuous-time Markov chains.\n\n### Algorithmic Design and Underlying Principles\n\nThe solution proceeds in four main stages for each test case: constructing the HKY85 generator matrix $Q$, computing the transition probability matrix $P(t)$ via two independent methods, and finally, calculating a set of diagnostic metrics.\n\n#### 1. Construction and Scaling of the Generator Matrix $Q$\n\nThe HKY85 model is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) on the state space of four nucleotides $\\{A, C, G, T\\}$, which we index as $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The dynamics of this process are governed by the infinitesimal generator matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 4}$.\n\nThe off-diagonal entries $Q_{ij}$ (for $i \\neq j$) represent the instantaneous rate of substitution from nucleotide $i$ to nucleotide $j$. In the HKY85 model, this rate is defined as $Q_{ij} = s_{ij} \\pi_j$. Here, $\\pi = (\\pi_A, \\pi_C, \\pi_G, \\pi_T)$ is the vector of stationary (or equilibrium) base frequencies, and $s_{ij}$ is a rate multiplier that depends on whether the substitution is a transition or a transversion.\n\n-   A **transition** is a substitution between purines ($A \\leftrightarrow G$) or between pyrimidines ($C \\leftrightarrow T$). For these pairs, $s_{ij} = \\kappa$, where $\\kappa > 0$ is the transition-to-transversion rate ratio.\n-   A **transversion** is a substitution between a purine and a pyrimidine. For these pairs, $s_{ij} = 1$.\n\nThe base order is fixed as $(A, C, G, T)$. The matrix of rate multipliers $S_m$ (with $i,j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$) for off-diagonal elements is:\n$$\nS_m = \\begin{pmatrix}\n- & 1 & \\kappa & 1 \\\\\n1 & - & 1 & \\kappa \\\\\n\\kappa & 1 & - & 1 \\\\\n1 & \\kappa & 1 & -\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe diagonal entries of $Q$ are determined by the property that the sum of each row of a generator matrix must be zero: $Q_{ii} = -\\sum_{j \\neq i} Q_{ij}$. This ensures the conservation of probability.\n\nLet this initially constructed matrix be $Q'$. The problem requires that $Q$ be scaled such that the expected number of substitutions per site per unit of time, $\\mu$, is equal to $1$. This expected rate is defined as the average of the exit rates from each state, weighted by their stationary frequencies: $\\mu = -\\sum_{i} \\pi_i Q_{ii}$. We first calculate this rate for the unscaled matrix, $\\mu' = -\\sum_{i} \\pi_i Q'_{ii}$, and then define the final, scaled generator as $Q = Q' / \\mu'$. This normalization makes the branch length $t$ interpretable as the expected number of substitutions per site.\n\n#### 2. Computation of the Transition Probability Matrix $P(t)$\n\nThe matrix $P(t)$, where $P_{ij}(t)$ is the probability of being in state $j$ at time $t$ given the process was in state $i$ at time $0$, is given by the matrix exponential:\n$$\nP(t) = \\exp(Q t)\n$$\nWe compute this matrix using two distinct methods to cross-validate the results.\n\n**Method 1: Spectral Decomposition**\n\nThe HKY85 model is designed to be **time-reversible** with respect to $\\pi$, satisfying the detailed balance condition $\\pi_i Q_{ij} = \\pi_j Q_{ji}$. This property implies that $Q$ is similar to a symmetric matrix, which allows for a stable and elegant eigendecomposition. Let $S = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sqrt{\\pi_0}, \\sqrt{\\pi_1}, \\sqrt{\\pi_2}, \\sqrt{\\pi_3})$. The similarity transformation is given by $H = S Q S^{-1}$. The entries of this symmetrized matrix $H$ are:\n$$\nH_{ij} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_i}{\\pi_j}} Q_{ij} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi_i}{\\pi_j}} (s_{ij} \\pi_j) = s_{ij} \\sqrt{\\pi_i \\pi_j}\n$$\nSince $s_{ij} = s_{ji}$, it is clear that $H_{ij} = H_{ji}$, so $H$ is a symmetric matrix.\n\nA symmetric matrix has a complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors and real eigenvalues. Thus, we can write its eigendecomposition as $H = U \\Lambda U^T$, where $U$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $H$, and $\\Lambda = \\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_0, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ is the diagonal matrix of corresponding eigenvalues.\n\nFrom $Q = S^{-1} H S$, we derive the expression for $P(t)$:\n$$\nP(t) = \\exp(Q t) = \\exp((S^{-1} H S)t) = S^{-1} \\exp(H t) S = S^{-1} (U \\exp(\\Lambda t) U^T) S\n$$\nThe matrix $\\exp(\\Lambda t)$ is simply a diagonal matrix with entries $e^{\\lambda_i t}$. This provides a numerically stable and analytically powerful method to calculate $P(t)$.\n\nThis spectral approach illuminates the central role of the stationary frequencies $\\pi$. First, the eigenstructure (eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and eigenvectors in $U$) of the symmetrized operator $H$ is directly determined by its entries $s_{ij}\\sqrt{\\pi_i \\pi_j}$, which are functions of $\\pi$. Second, reversibility implies that $\\pi$ is the stationary distribution of the process. This means $\\pi$ is the left eigenvector of $Q$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda=0$, satisfying $\\pi Q = \\mathbf{0}$. This zero-eigenvalue mode governs the long-term behavior of the system, ensuring that as $t \\to \\infty$, each row of $P(t)$ converges to $\\pi$.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Numerical Matrix Exponential**\n\nAs an independent verification, we compute $P(t)$ directly using a robust numerical algorithm for the matrix exponential. We use the `scipy.linalg.expm` function, which implements a scaling and squaring algorithm based on Padé approximants. This method is a standard and highly reliable way to compute the exponential of a general square matrix.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{num}}(t) = \\mathrm{expm}(Q t)\n$$\n\n#### 3. Diagnostic Metrics\n\nWe quantify the properties of the computed transition matrix $P(t) = P_{\\mathrm{spec}}(t)$ and compare it with the numerical version $P_{\\mathrm{num}}(t)$ through four diagnostics:\n\n1.  **Frobenius Norm Difference**: $\\lVert P_{\\mathrm{spec}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{num}}(t) \\rVert_F$. This measures the overall numerical discrepancy between the two computational methods. A small value validates the correctness of both implementations.\n\n2.  **Maximal Row-Sum Violation**: $\\max_{i} \\left| \\sum_{j} P_{ij}(t) - 1 \\right|$. For any valid transition probability matrix, each row must sum to $1$, as the process must transition to *some* state. This metric checks for violations of this stochasticity property due to numerical errors.\n\n3.  **Stationarity Violation**: $\\lVert \\pi P(t) - \\pi \\rVert_2$. Since $\\pi$ is the stationary distribution, it must be invariant under the action of $P(t)$, i.e., $\\pi P(t) = \\pi$. This diagnostic computes the Euclidean norm of the difference, measuring any deviation from this fundamental property.\n\n4.  **Maximal Row Deviation from Stationarity**: $\\max_{i} \\lVert P_{i\\cdot}(t) - \\pi \\rVert_2$. Each row $P_{i\\cdot}(t)$ of the transition matrix represents the probability distribution of states at time $t$, starting from state $i$. As $t \\to \\infty$, all rows should converge to the stationary distribution $\\pi$. This metric measures the maximum Euclidean distance of any such row from $\\pi$, indicating how close the system is to equilibrium.",
