For single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, raw transcript counts are heavily influenced by factors like cell-specific capture efficiency and sequencing depth, making direct comparisons between cells problematic.

To construct a joint latent space, the scRNA-seq modality must first be transformed to a stabilized, relative abundance scale that is comparable across cells of varying sequencing depths. In scRNA-seq, Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) counts $c_{ig}$ for gene $g$ in cell $i$ are proportional to the number of captured transcript molecules, and the total $\\sum_{g} c_{ig}$ reflects the library size for cell $i$.\n\nStarting from the following well-tested processing steps grounded in standard practice for single-cell transcript quantification:\n- Relative abundance is obtained by dividing the raw count for a gene by the cell’s total UMI count, yielding a fraction $c_{ig} / \\sum_{g} c_{ig}$.\n- To render the scale interpretable and mitigate the extreme sparsity typical in single-cell data while maintaining comparability across cells, this fraction is rescaled to counts per $10^{4}$ by multiplying by $10^{4}$.\n- To stabilize variance and dampen the influence of highly expressed genes, apply a logarithm with base $2$ to the rescaled quantity, adding a pseudocount of $1$ before the log to avoid taking a logarithm of zero.\n\nUsing these definitions, derive the symbolic expression for the log-normalized expression $\\tilde{x}_{ig}$ and then compute its value for a cell with raw UMI count $c_{ig} = 50$ for a particular gene and total UMI count $\\sum_{g} c_{ig} = 5000$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid and well-posed request within the domain of bioinformatics and computational biology. It describes a standard procedure for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data normalization, a critical preprocessing step for downstream analyses such as multi-omics integration. All provided information is scientifically sound, self-contained, and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe task is to first derive the symbolic expression for the log-normalized expression, denoted as $\\tilde{x}_{ig}$, for gene $g$ in cell $i$, and then to compute its numerical value given specific UMI counts. We will follow the prescribed sequence of operations.\n\nLet $c_{ig}$ be the raw Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI) count for gene $g$ in cell $i$.\nLet $C_i = \\sum_{g} c_{ig}$ be the total UMI count for cell $i$, which is also referred to as the library size of the cell.\n\nThe normalization process consists of three defined steps:\n\nStep 1: Compute the relative abundance of the gene's transcripts in the cell. This is achieved by dividing the raw count for the gene by the total UMI count for the cell.\n$$ \\text{Relative Abundance} = \\frac{c_{ig}}{C_i} = \\frac{c_{ig}}{\\sum_{g} c_{ig}} $$\n\nStep 2: Rescale the relative abundance to a common scale, typically \"counts per 10,000\" (CP10k) or \"transcripts per 10,000\" (TP10k), to facilitate comparison across cells with different library sizes. This is done by multiplying the relative abundance by a scale factor of $10^4$.\n$$ \\text{Rescaled Value} = \\left( \\frac{c_{ig}}{\\sum_{g} c_{ig}} \\right) \\times 10^4 $$\n\nStep 3: Apply a log-transformation to the rescaled value. This transformation helps to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels and reduces the skewness of the data distribution. A pseudocount of $1$ is added before taking the logarithm to ensure that the argument of the logarithm is always positive, thus avoiding issues with genes that have zero counts. The base of the logarithm is specified as $2$.\nThe log-normalized expression $\\tilde{x}_{ig}$ is therefore:\n$$ \\tilde{x}_{ig} = \\log_{2}\\left( \\left( \\frac{c_{ig}}{\\sum_{g} c_{ig}} \\right) \\times 10^4 + 1 \\right) $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression.\n\nNow, we will compute the value of $\\tilde{x}_{ig}$ for the given data:\n- Raw UMI count for the gene of interest: $c_{ig} = 50$\n- Total UMI count for the cell: $\\sum_{g} c_{ig} = 5000$\n\nSubstituting these values into the symbolic expression:\n$$ \\tilde{x}_{ig} = \\log_{2}\\left( \\left( \\frac{50}{5000} \\right) \\times 10^4 + 1 \\right) $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{50}{5000} = \\frac{5}{500} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01 $$\n\nNext, we perform the rescaling:\n$$ 0.01 \\times 10^4 = 0.01 \\times 10000 = 100 $$\n\nThen, we add the pseudocount of $1$:\n$$ 100 + 1 = 101 $$\n\nFinally, we take the logarithm with base $2$:\n$$ \\tilde{x}_{ig} = \\log_{2}(101) $$\n\nTo compute the numerical value, we can use the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_{b}(a) = \\frac{\\ln(a)}{\\ln(b)}$:\n$$ \\tilde{x}_{ig} = \\frac{\\ln(101)}{\\ln(2)} $$\n\nUsing standard values for natural logarithms:\n$$ \\ln(101) \\approx 4.6151205168 $$\n$$ \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931471806 $$\n\n$$ \\tilde{x}_{ig} \\approx \\frac{4.6151205168}{0.6931471806} \\approx 6.6582115934 $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $6$, $5$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the last digit).\n\nTherefore, the log-normalized expression value is approximately $6.658$. This value is dimensionless, as the units of counts in the numerator and denominator of the initial fraction cancel out.",
