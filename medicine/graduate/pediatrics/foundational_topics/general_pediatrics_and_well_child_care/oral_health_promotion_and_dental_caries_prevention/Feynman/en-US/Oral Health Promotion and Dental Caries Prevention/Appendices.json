This exercise translates the qualitative concept of a post-sugar \"acid attack,\" classically represented by the Stephan curve, into a quantitative measure of risk.

            "problem": "A single post-sucrose acidogenic episode in a child’s dental plaque is modeled by an exponential recovery of hydrogen ion concentration described in terms of acidity by the function $pH(t)=7-1.8\\exp(-t/5)$ for $t \\geq 0$, where $t$ is in minutes. The critical enamel demineralization $pH$ is approximately $5.5$, and net demineralization occurs only during intervals when $pH(t)<5.5$. Define the cumulative minutes below the critical threshold over the interval $[0,20]$ minutes as the total measure of times $t \\in [0,20]$ for which $pH(t)<5.5$. Compute this cumulative time from first principles and provide the numerical value. Round your answer to $4$ significant figures and express your result in minutes. Then, based on the computed duration below $pH=5.5$, briefly interpret the implication for lesion initiation in primary enamel under otherwise normal salivary conditions (no xerostomia, no additional sugar exposures, and typical plaque biofilm).",
            "solution": "The first part of the task is to compute the total time duration for which the plaque $pH$ is below the critical value of $5.5$. This requires solving the inequality $pH(t) < 5.5$.\n\nThe given function for $pH$ is:\n$$pH(t) = 7 - 1.8\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)$$\nWe set up the inequality:\n$$7 - 1.8\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right) < 5.5$$\nTo solve for $t$, we first isolate the exponential term.\n$$7 - 5.5 < 1.8\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)$$\n$$1.5 < 1.8\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)$$\nDivide both sides by $1.8$:\n$$\\frac{1.5}{1.8} < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{1.5}{1.8}$ simplifies to $\\frac{15}{18} = \\frac{5}{6}$.\n$$\\frac{5}{6} < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $t$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides. Since the natural logarithm function, $\\ln(x)$, is monotonically increasing for $x > 0$, the direction of the inequality is preserved.\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) < \\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{5}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) < -\\frac{t}{5}$$\nNow, we multiply both sides by $-5$. Multiplying by a negative number reverses the direction of the inequality.\n$$-5\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right) > t$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$t < -5\\ln\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $-a\\ln(b) = \\ln(b^{-a})$, we have:\n$$t < 5\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)^{-1}\\right)$$\n$$t < 5\\ln\\left(\\frac{6}{5}\\right)$$\nLet's define the critical time $t_c$ as the moment when $pH(t) = 5.5$. From our calculation, $t_c = 5\\ln(\\frac{6}{5})$. The inequality $pH(t) < 5.5$ is satisfied for $t < t_c$.\n\nThe problem states that the model is valid for $t \\geq 0$. We must check if the demineralization period starts at $t=0$.\nAt $t=0$, $pH(0) = 7 - 1.8\\exp(0) = 7 - 1.8 = 5.2$.\nSince $5.2 < 5.5$, the pH is below the critical threshold at the very beginning of the episode.\nThe function $pH(t)$ is monotonically increasing for $t \\geq 0$, as the term $-1.8\\exp(-t/5)$ increases with $t$. Therefore, the pH will be below $5.5$ for the entire interval from $t=0$ up to the time $t_c$ when it reaches $5.5$.\n\nThe total time for which demineralization occurs is the length of the interval $[0, t_c)$. This duration is $t_c - 0 = t_c = 5\\ln(\\frac{6}{5})$ minutes.\nThe problem asks for this cumulative time over the interval $[0,20]$. We need to ensure that $t_c$ is within this interval.\nUsing $\\ln(1.2)$, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$t_c = 5\\ln(1.2) \\approx 5 \\times 0.18232155679 \\approx 0.91160778 \\text{ minutes}$$\nSince $0.91160778 < 20$, the entire demineralization period is contained within the observation interval $[0, 20]$. Thus, the cumulative time below the critical threshold is indeed $t_c$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$t_c \\approx 0.9116 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret the implication of this result.\nThe computed duration of demineralization is approximately $0.9116$ minutes, which is less than one minute. Dental caries is a chronic disease process that results from a long-term imbalance where cumulative demineralization exceeds cumulative remineralization. A single, isolated acidogenic challenge of such a short duration is clinically insignificant. Under the specified \"otherwise normal salivary conditions,\" saliva provides a robust defense mechanism. Its buffering agents (like bicarbonate) neutralize the acid, and its supersaturation with calcium and phosphate ions promotes the remineralization of the enamel surface once the pH rises above the critical value of $5.5$. The period of remineralization following this brief acid attack would be substantially longer and more than sufficient to repair any minuscule mineral loss that occurred. Therefore, an isolated event of this nature poses a negligible risk for the initiation of a new carious lesion. The disease of caries arises from frequent and/or prolonged pH drops that overwhelm the mouth's natural repair capacity over time.",
