            "introduction": "A screening tool's effectiveness cannot be judged by its sensitivity and specificity alone; its real-world utility depends on the prevalence of the condition in the population being screened. This exercise guides you through calculating the Positive and Negative Predictive Values ($PPV$ and $NPV$), which are crucial for understanding the clinical meaning of a test result. By applying Bayes' theorem, you will see how a test's performance metrics shift with the underlying risk of the population, a foundational concept for implementing any screening program. ",

            "problem": "In an adolescent primary care practice implementing Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT), clinicians use a validated brief screening tool such as the Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, Trouble (CRAFFT) questionnaire to identify adolescents with moderate-to-severe Substance Use Disorder (SUD). In a representative patient panel, the point prevalence of moderate-to-severe SUD is estimated to be $p = 0.08$. For the screening tool, the sensitivity is $Se = 0.85$ and the specificity is $Sp = 0.93$. Using the foundational definitions of conditional probability and Bayes’ theorem, derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of this screening tool in this population, and compute their numerical values. Express $PPV$ and $NPV$ as decimals and round your answers to four significant figures. Then, interpret the clinical implications of the resulting $PPV$ and $NPV$ for brief intervention planning in adolescent primary care without performing any additional calculations in your interpretation.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of epidemiology and probability theory, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an adolescent has a moderate-to-severe Substance Use Disorder (SUD), and let $D^c$ be the event that the adolescent does not have the disorder. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result from the screening tool.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe point prevalence of the disorder, $p$, is the prior probability of an adolescent having SUD.\n$$P(D) = p = 0.08$$\nThe probability of an adolescent not having SUD is therefore:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$$\nThe sensitivity of the tool, $Se$, is the conditional probability of a positive test result given that the adolescent has SUD.\n$$Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.85$$\nThe specificity of the tool, $Sp$, is the conditional probability of a negative test result given that the adolescent does not have SUD.\n$$Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.93$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can also define the false negative rate (the probability of a negative test in a person with the disease) and the false positive rate (the probability of a positive test in a person without the disease):\nThe false negative rate is $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.93 = 0.07$.\n\nThe objective is to derive expressions for and calculate the Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) and the Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$).\n\nThe $PPV$ is the conditional probability that an adolescent has SUD given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known quantities in terms of $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se)(p) + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)$$\nTherefore, the general expression for $PPV$ is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1 - Sp)(1 - p)}$$\n\nThe $NPV$ is the conditional probability that an adolescent does not have SUD given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the known quantities in terms of $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp)(1 - p) + (1 - Se)(p)$$\nTherefore, the general expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1 - p)}{Sp \\cdot (1 - p) + (1 - Se) \\cdot p}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for $PPV$ and $NPV$ using the provided data: $p=0.08$, $Se=0.85$, and $Sp=0.93$.\n\nFor $PPV$:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.08}{0.85 \\cdot 0.08 + (1 - 0.93)(1 - 0.08)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.068}{0.068 + (0.07)(0.92)}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.068}{0.068 + 0.0644}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.068}{0.1324} \\approx 0.513595166...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.5136$.\n\nFor $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.93 \\cdot (1 - 0.08)}{0.93 \\cdot (1 - 0.08) + (1 - 0.85) \\cdot 0.08}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.93 \\cdot 0.92}{0.93 \\cdot 0.92 + (0.15) \\cdot 0.08}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.8556}{0.8556 + 0.012}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.8556}{0.8676} \\approx 0.98616874...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9862$.\n\nInterpretation of the clinical implications:\n\nThe calculated $PPV$ is $0.5136$. This means that among adolescents who test positive with the CRAFFT tool in this population, there is a $51.36\\%$ probability that they actually have a moderate-to-severe SUD. Clinically, this moderate $PPV$ implies that a positive screen is a significant flag but not a definitive diagnosis. Nearly half ($1 - 0.5136 = 0.4864$ or about $48.6\\%$) of the positive results are false positives. Therefore, every positive screen warrants a brief intervention and further clinical assessment to confirm the diagnosis before considering a referral to specialized treatment. The brief intervention acts as a crucial second-stage evaluation.\n\nThe calculated $NPV$ is $0.9862$. This means that among adolescents who test negative, there is a $98.62\\%$ probability that they do not have a moderate-to-severe SUD. This very high $NPV$ is clinically extremely useful. It indicates that a negative test result is highly reliable for ruling out the condition. Clinicians can be very confident that an adolescent with a negative screen is unlikely to have a moderate-to-severe SUD, allowing them to efficiently focus their limited time and resources on the higher-risk, screen-positive group. The high $NPV$ validates the tool's effectiveness for population-level screening to identify those who do not require immediate further evaluation for SUD.",

            "solution": "This is a valid problem grounded in standard biostatistical methods for evaluating diagnostic tests. The solution proceeds by following the four requested tasks.\n\n**1. Compute True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR)**\n\nA positive test is defined as a CRAFFT score $\\geq c$.

Construct ROC Coordinates and Estimate AUC**\n\nThe ROC coordinates are pairs of (FPR, TPR) from the table above, plotted from $(0,0)$ to $(1,1)$. The points are:\n$(0, 0)$, $(0.0071, 0.0833)$, $(0.0357, 0.2500)$, $(0.0857, 0.4667)$, $(0.1714, 0.7000)$, $(0.3286, 0.8833)$, $(0.5714, 0.9667)$, $(1, 1)$.\n\nApplying the trapezoidal rule to these coordinates gives an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of approximately $0.845$.\n\n**3. Compute Youden's Index and Select the Optimal Threshold**\n\nYouden's index is defined as $J(c) = \\text{Sensitivity}(c) + \\text{Specificity}(c) - 1 = \\text{TPR}(c) - \\text{FPR}(c)$. We calculate it for the specified thresholds:\n- $J(c=1) = 0.9667 - 0.5714 = 0.3953$\n- $J(c=2) = 0.8833 - 0.3286 = 0.5547$\n- $J(c=3) = 0.7000 - 0.1714 = 0.5286$\n- $J(c=4) = 0.4667 - 0.0857 = 0.3810$\n- $J(c=5) = 0.2500 - 0.0357 = 0.2143$\n- $J(c=6) = 0.0833 - 0.0071 = 0.0762$\n\nThe maximum value of Youden's index is $0.5547$, which occurs at the threshold $c=2$. Since no other threshold has a Youden's index within $0.02$ of this maximum value, the tie-breaking rule is not needed. The threshold that maximizes Youden's index is $c=2$.\n\n**4. Interpretation**\n\nThe AUC of approximately $0.845$ indicates that the CRAFFT screen has good to excellent discriminatory power, meaning it is much better than chance at distinguishing between adolescents with and without an SUD.\n\nThe optimal cutoff of $c=2$ balances the trade-off between finding true cases and avoiding false alarms. At this cutoff, the sensitivity is high ($88.3\\%$), ensuring that most adolescents who have an SUD are identified for further intervention. The specificity is $1 - 0.3286 = 67.1\\%$. This means that while about a third of SUD-negative adolescents will screen positive (and receive an unnecessary but low-risk brief intervention), the clinic successfully captures a large majority of at-risk youth. This aligns with a public health approach where prioritizing high sensitivity is often preferred to minimize missed cases, especially when the follow-up intervention is brief and non-invasive.",

Decision curve analysis advances our evaluation from diagnostic accuracy to clinical utility by explicitly weighing the benefits of intervention for true positives against the potential costs or harms of intervention for false positives.

The solution is presented in two parts: first, the derivation of the per-patient net benefit formula from the given principles, and second, the application of this formula to the provided data to find the optimal threshold $\\tau^{\\star}$.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Per-Patient Net Benefit Expression\n\nThe problem defines the total expected utility for a population of size $N$ based on the classification of individuals into four groups: true positives ($TP$), false positives ($FP$), true negatives ($TN$), and false negatives ($FN$). The decision rule is to offer an intervention if an adolescent's predicted risk $p$ exceeds a threshold $\\tau$.\n\nAccording to the provided utility scale:\n- A true positive (an adolescent who develops the outcome and is correctly treated) contributes a utility of $+1$.\n- A false positive (an adolescent who would not develop the outcome but is unnecessarily treated) contributes a utility of $-w(\\tau)$.\n- True negatives and false negatives, being untreated, contribute a utility of $0$.\n\nThe total utility, $U_{total}$, for the cohort under a given threshold $\\tau$ is the sum of utilities across all individuals:\n$$U_{total}(\\tau) = (TP \\times 1) + (FP \\times [-w(\\tau)]) + (TN \\times 0) + (FN \\times 0)$$\n$$U_{total}(\\tau) = TP - FP \\cdot w(\\tau)$$\nThe problem asks for the \"per-patient net benefit,\" which is the total utility normalized by the cohort size $N$. Let us denote this as $NB(\\tau)$:\n$$NB(\\tau) = \\frac{U_{total}(\\tau)}{N} = \\frac{TP - FP \\cdot w(\\tau)}{N}$$\nTo complete this expression, we must determine the weight $w(\\tau)$. The problem states that the threshold $\\tau$ represents the risk at which a clinician would be indifferent between treating and not treating a patient. We can formalize this principle by considering a single patient with a predicted risk of developing the outcome equal to $p$.\n\nThe expected utility of treating this patient, $E[U(\\text{treat})|p]$, is given by:\n$$E[U(\\text{treat})|p] = P(\\text{outcome}) \\times U(\\text{TP}) + P(\\text{no outcome}) \\times U(\\text{FP})$$\n$$E[U(\\text{treat})|p] = p \\cdot (1) + (1-p) \\cdot (-w(\\tau)) = p - (1-p)w(\\tau)$$\nThe expected utility of not treating this patient, $E[U(\\text{no treat})|p]$, is:\n$$E[U(\\text{no treat})|p] = P(\\text{outcome}) \\times U(\\text{FN}) + P(\\text{no outcome}) \\times U(\\text{TN})$$\n$$E[U(\\text{no treat})|p] = p \\cdot (0) + (1-p) \\cdot (0) = 0$$\nThe indifference principle states that at the specific risk level $p = \\tau$, these two expected utilities are equal:\n$$E[U(\\text{treat})|p=\\tau] = E[U(\\text{no treat})|p=\\tau]$$\n$$\\tau - (1-\\tau)w(\\tau) = 0$$\nSolving for the weight $w(\\tau)$:\n$$(1-\\tau)w(\\tau) = \\tau$$\n$$w(\\tau) = \\frac{\\tau}{1-\\tau}$$\nThis expression for $w(\\tau)$ is the odds of the threshold probability.
