The infant is placed supine in a safety-approved crib with a firm mattress, no soft bedding, and room-sharing without bed-sharing, consistent with the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep guidance. The diary entries are: bedtime $21:00$, observed sleep onset $21:45$, multiple nocturnal awakenings totaling $35$ minutes of wake after initially falling asleep, and final wake and out-of-crib time $06:45$. Using only core definitions in pediatric sleep medicine, proceed from first principles:\n\n- Time in bed is the elapsed interval from bedtime to the final out-of-crib time.\n- Sleep latency is the elapsed interval from bedtime to sleep onset.\n- Wake after sleep onset (WASO) is the total time awake after initial sleep onset until the final awakening.\n- Total sleep time is the portion of time in bed that is actually spent asleep.\n- Sleep efficiency is the proportion of time in bed that is spent asleep.\n\nCompute the sleep efficiency and wake after sleep onset for this night from the diary.

All data required for the solution are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe task is to compute two metrics from a sleep diary: wake after sleep onset ($WASO$) and sleep efficiency ($SE$). We will proceed from the definitions provided.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information using mathematical notation.\nThe given times are:\n- Bedtime, $T_{bedtime} = 21:00$\n- Sleep onset, $T_{onset} = 21:45$\n- Final wake and out-of-crib time, $T_{final\\_wake} = 06:45$\nThe duration of nocturnal awakenings is given as $35$ minutes.\n\nThe problem asks for Wake After Sleep Onset ($WASO$) and Sleep Efficiency ($SE$).\n\n1.  **Determination of Wake After Sleep Onset ($WASO$)**\n    The problem defines $WASO$ as \"the total time awake after initial sleep onset until the final awakening.\" It also provides the datum \"multiple nocturnal awakenings totaling $35$ minutes of wake after initially falling asleep.\" By direct correspondence with the definition, the value of $WASO$ is given explicitly.\n    $$WASO = 35 \\text{ minutes}$$\n    The problem asks for this value as an exact integer in minutes, which is $35$.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Sleep Efficiency ($SE$)**\n    Sleep efficiency is defined as \"the proportion of time in bed that is spent asleep.\" This can be expressed as a formula:\n    $$SE = \\frac{\\text{Total Sleep Time (TST)}}{\\text{Time in Bed (TIB)}}$$\n    To calculate $SE$, we must first determine $TIB$ and $TST$.\n\n    a.  **Calculate Time in Bed ($TIB$)**:\n        $TIB$ is defined as \"the elapsed interval from bedtime to the final out-of-crib time.\"\n        $$TIB = T_{final\\_wake} - T_{bedtime}$$\n        The time from $21:00$ on one day to $06:45$ on the next day is calculated as follows:\n        - Time from $21:00$ to midnight ($24:00$ or $00:00$): $3$ hours.\n        - Time from midnight to $06:45$: $6$ hours and $45$ minutes.\n        Total $TIB = 3 \\text{ hours} + 6 \\text{ hours } 45 \\text{ minutes} = 9 \\text{ hours } 45 \\text{ minutes}$.\n        To facilitate calculation, we convert $TIB$ entirely into minutes:\n        $$TIB = (9 \\times 60) + 45 = 540 + 45 = 585 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n    b.  **Calculate Total Sleep Time ($TST$)**:\n        $TST$ is defined as \"the portion of time in bed that is actually spent asleep.\" It can be calculated by subtracting all periods of wakefulness from the total time in bed. The periods of wakefulness are the initial time to fall asleep (Sleep Latency, $SL$) and the time awake during the night ($WASO$).\n        $$TST = TIB - (SL + WASO)$$\n        We must first find the sleep latency, $SL$.\n\n    c.  **Calculate Sleep Latency ($SL$)**:\n        $SL$ is defined as \"the elapsed interval from bedtime to sleep onset.\"\n        $$SL = T_{onset} - T_{bedtime} = 21:45 - 21:00 = 45 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n    d.  **Final Calculation of $TST$**:\n        Using the values for $TIB$, $SL$, and $WASO$:\n        $$TST = 585 - (45 + 35) = 585 - 80 = 505 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\n    e.  **Final Calculation of $SE$**:\n        Now we can compute the sleep efficiency:\n        $$SE = \\frac{TST}{TIB} = \\frac{505}{585}$$\n        To express this as a decimal fraction, we perform the division:\n        $$SE \\approx 0.863247863...$$\n        The problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n        $$SE \\approx 0.8632$$\n\nThe calculated values are a sleep efficiency of approximately $0.8632$ and a wake after sleep onset of $35$ minutes.

            "problem": "A $20$-month-old toddler is referred for sleep-onset association disorder characterized by reliance on rocking and parental presence to initiate sleep. Baseline over $14$ nights by parent diary corroborated with actigraphy shows: mean sleep latency $45$ minutes, bedtime attempted at $19:30$, lights out at $19:40$, $3$ nighttime awakenings requiring rocking ($10$–$20$ minutes each), total nighttime sleep $9$ hours, $2$ daytime naps totaling $3$ hours with the last nap ending at $17:00$, and wake time at $06:30$. The child is put to sleep in a crib after being rocked to sleep in a caregiver’s arms; on some nights co-sleeping is used after the first awakening. There are no medical comorbidities, and development is typical. Physical sleep environment is a crib with a firm mattress and no loose bedding; occasionally a bottle is offered at night during rocking.\n\nYou are asked to design a first-line, behavioral, home-based plan that aligns with learning theory and the two-process model of sleep regulation, and to predict how the plan changes sleep latency and night awakenings. Use as fundamental base: core definitions from operant conditioning (reinforcement, extinction, discriminative stimulus, partial reinforcement), stimulus control principles, and the two-process model in which the homeostatic sleep drive $S$ increases with time awake and the circadian process $C$ gates sleep propensity.\n\nWhich option best explains a mechanism-consistent plan and its expected effects within $1$–$2$ weeks while maintaining pediatric safe sleep practices?\n\nA.

Predict reduced sleep latency as $S$ increases with longer pre-sleep wakefulness and fewer awakenings as extinction reduces reinforcement of signaling.\n\nB. Provide immediate positive reinforcement (stickers) when the child stays in the crib at lights out but continue rocking fully to sleep before transfer to the crib; move bedtime $60$ minutes earlier to increase total opportunity for sleep and drop the afternoon nap to increase sleepiness; check on the child every time crying occurs to soothe briefly.

The scenario describes a classic presentation of behavioral insomnia of childhood, sleep-onset association type. The principles cited—operant conditioning and the two-process model of sleep—are the standard, evidence-based theoretical foundations for its management. The sleep parameters provided are internally consistent. The total $24$-hour sleep time ($9 \\text{ hours night} + 3 \\text{ hours day} = 12 \\text{ hours}$) is appropriate for a $20$-month-old. The long sleep latency of $45$ minutes is logically explained by the short wake interval between the end of the last nap ($17:00$) and lights out ($19:40$), which amounts to only $2$ hours and $40$ minutes. This implies an insufficient build-up of the homeostatic sleep drive, Process $S$. No-fault found.\n\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is highly specific and directly asks for the application of formal scientific models to a clinical case. It is perfectly relevant to the field of pediatrics and sleep medicine. No-fault found.\n\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The data provided are sufficient and consistent for formulating a behavioral plan. The stated total nighttime sleep of $9$ hours is consistent with calculations based on sleep onset time (approximately $19:40 + 45 \\text{ min} = 20:25$), wake time ($06:30$), and total wake after sleep onset (approximately $3 \\times 15 \\text{ min} = 45 \\text{ min}$). Specifically, time in bed is $10$ hours and $5$ minutes, so total sleep time is $10 \\text{ h } 5 \\text{ min} - 45 \\text{ min} = 9 \\text{ h } 20 \\text{ min}$, which is reasonably reported as $9$ hours. No significant contradictions are present. No-fault found.\n\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The clinical scenario is highly realistic and represents a common referral to pediatricians and sleep specialists. No-fault found.\n\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The problem is well-posed. It requests the *best* option according to a clear set of criteria (consistency with learning theory, the two-process model, and safe sleep practices), which allows for a unique, optimal solution among the choices. No-fault found.\n\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires the non-trivial integration of physiological and psychological principles to derive a multi-component intervention. No-fault found.\n\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The effectiveness of the behavioral interventions in question is well-established in scientific literature and empirically verifiable. No-fault found.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a behavioral intervention based on three pillars: operant conditioning, stimulus control, and the two-process model.\n\n1.  **Two-Process Model Analysis:** The homeostatic sleep drive, Process $S$, builds during wakefulness. The circadian process, Process $C$, dictates the timing of sleep propensity. For efficient sleep onset, Process $S$ must be high at a time when Process $C$ favors sleep. The child's schedule involves a nap ending at $17:00$ and a lights-out time of $19:40$. The intervening wake period of $2$ hours and $40$ minutes is insufficient for a $20$-month-old to build adequate sleep pressure. This mismatch between bedtime and biological readiness is the cause of the $45$-minute sleep latency. The intervention must, therefore, increase the duration of wakefulness before bed. This is achieved through **bedtime fading**: initially delaying bedtime to align with the child's natural sleep onset time (approx. $20:25$), thereby ensuring high $S$ pressure and rapid sleep onset, and then gradually advancing the bedtime once this is established. A consistent wake time is also critical for stabilizing Process $C$.\n\n2.  **Operant Conditioning Analysis:** The child's crying/signaling at sleep onset and during the night is a behavior that is reinforced by parental intervention (rocking, presence, bottle). This constitutes **positive reinforcement** of a behavior that is incompatible with independent sleep. The fact that the reinforcement is intermittent (co-sleeping sometimes, rocking at other times) places the behavior on a **partial reinforcement schedule**, which makes it highly resistant to extinction. The intervention must involve **extinction**: the systematic removal of the reinforcement. **Graduated extinction**, where parental checks are brief, non-reinforcing (no rocking/picking up), and occur at progressively increasing intervals, is a standard method to achieve this.\n\n3.  **Stimulus Control Analysis:** The child has learned to associate sleep onset with a set of parental actions (rocking, presence) rather than with being in the crib. The rocking and parent are the **discriminative stimuli** for sleep. The goal of **stimulus control therapy** is to re-associate the crib environment with sleep. This requires putting the child in the crib *drowsy but awake* and ensuring the crib is used only for sleep. Extraneous associations, such as co-sleeping or bottles in the crib, must be eliminated. This establishes the crib as the primary and sole discriminative stimulus for sleep.\n\n4.  **Safe Sleep Practices:** Eliminating bottles in the crib is essential to prevent choking and dental caries. Maintaining a crib with a firm mattress and no loose bedding is also a core tenet of safe sleep.\n\nBased on this derivation, the ideal plan combines bedtime fading, graduated extinction, and strict stimulus control, while upholding safe sleep practices.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Implement graduated extinction by using fixed, preplanned check-ins at progressively increasing intervals that are not contingent on crying, avoiding picking up or rocking; concurrently apply bedtime fading by initially shifting bedtime later to the child’s biologically sleepy time (e.g., $20:30$ if sleep latency then falls below $15$ minutes) and then advancing bedtime earlier by $10$–$15$ minutes every $2$–$3$ nights once rapid sleep onset is achieved; maintain a consistent wake time, eliminate bottles in the crib, and ensure the crib remains the discriminative stimulus for sleep without co-sleeping. Predict reduced sleep latency as $S$ increases with longer pre-sleep wakefulness and fewer awakenings as extinction reduces reinforcement of signaling.**\n-   **Evaluation:** This option correctly integrates all necessary components. It applies bedtime fading to address the Process $S$ deficit. It uses graduated extinction to address the reinforcement schedule. It enforces strict stimulus control by eliminating co-sleeping and making the crib the sole location for sleep. It removes the bottle from the crib, adhering to safety and stimulus control principles. The prediction is mechanistically correct: increased $S$ drive from a longer wake window reduces sleep latency, and extinction of reinforcement reduces signaling at night.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Provide immediate positive reinforcement (stickers) when the child stays in the crib at lights out but continue rocking fully to sleep before transfer to the crib; move bedtime $60$ minutes earlier to increase total opportunity for sleep and drop the afternoon nap to increase sleepiness; check on the child every time crying occurs to soothe briefly. Predict that more sleep opportunity and added attention will reduce crying and awakenings.**\n-   **Evaluation:** This plan is fundamentally flawed. Continuing to rock the child to sleep fails to address the core sleep-onset association. Moving bedtime earlier by $60$ minutes to $18:30$ directly contradicts the analysis of the two-process model, which indicates the bedtime is already too early. This would exacerbate the sleep latency problem. Stickers are developmentally inappropriate for a $20$-month-old as an abstract reward system. Responding to every cry, even briefly, can still act as reinforcement.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use a “camping out” method with caregiver presence in the room until sleep onset, moving the chair away over $2$–$3$ weeks; move bedtime earlier to $19:00$ to avoid overtiredness; allow brief verbal reassurance whenever crying occurs, with occasional rocking if crying escalates. Predict that graded withdrawal reduces anxiety and that an earlier bedtime lowers stress and thus shortens sleep latency.**\n-   **Evaluation:** This option contains multiple critical errors. Allowing \"occasional rocking if crying escalates\" is a recipe for establishing a powerful partial reinforcement schedule, which is the opposite of extinction. Moving the bedtime earlier to $19:00$ contradicts the physiological data indicating the child is \"undertired,\" not \"overtired,\" at the current bedtime of $19:40$. While \"camping out\" (parental fading) is a valid but slow form of extinction, it is rendered ineffective by the inclusion of reinforcement and the incorrect bedtime adjustment.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Start melatonin $1$–$2$ milligrams $30$ minutes before the current bedtime while continuing the usual rocking routine; allow a bottle in the crib to promote drowsiness; keep naps unchanged. Predict pharmacologic facilitation of sleep onset with fewer awakenings and minimal distress, while maintaining a comforting routine.**\n-   **Evaluation:** This is not a behavioral plan as requested. It is a pharmacological approach that fails to address the underlying learned behaviors. Continuing the rocking routine maintains the sleep-onset association. Allowing a bottle in the crib violates safe sleep guidelines and introduces a new sleep crutch. Melatonin does not teach a child to self-soothe, so night awakenings due to the lack of parental presence would likely persist. This plan fails to meet the core requirements of the task.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
