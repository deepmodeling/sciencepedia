            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient: A previously healthy $18$-month-old toddler.\n- Clinical History: Day $10$ of recovery from clinically diagnosed rotavirus acute gastroenteritis. Persistent watery diarrhea that worsens after reintroduction of a lactose-containing diet. Well hydrated on Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). No blood in stools.\n- Stool Sample Analysis Results:\n  - Stool osmolality ($O_{meas}$): $290$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$\n  - Stool sodium ([$ \\mathrm{Na}^{+}$]): $20$ $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$\n  - Stool potassium ([$ \\mathrm{K}^{+}$]): $35$ $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$\n  - Stool pH: $5.4$\n  - Semiquantitative reducing substances: $2+$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of physiology, pathophysiology, and clinical chemistry. The scenario of post-infectious secondary lactase deficiency is a well-documented clinical entity in pediatrics. The biophysical principles of osmosis, electroneutrality, and the biochemical basis of carbohydrate malabsorption are fundamental to the problem. All laboratory values are within a plausible range for the condition described. The methods listed are standard.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for a definition, a calculation, and a clinical interpretation based on the provided data. The given information is sufficient to compute the stool osmotic gap and to reason through the differential diagnosis presented.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative, and clinical language. There are no subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria. It is scientifically sound, completely formalizable, contains a complete and consistent setup, describes a realistic clinical scenario, is well-structured, is non-trivial, and is scientifically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation and computation of the stool osmotic gap, and second, the integration of all clinical data to differentiate between osmotic and secretory diarrhea.\n\n**Part 1: Definition and Computation of the Stool Osmotic Gap**\n\nThe total osmolality of an aqueous solution, such as stool water, is a colligative property that depends on the total concentration of all dissolved solute particles. This total osmolality, denoted $O_{meas}$, can be measured directly using freezing-point osmometry. For the given patient, $O_{meas} = 290$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nThe principle of electroneutrality requires that the total concentration of positive charges (cations) equals the total concentration of negative charges (anions) in the solution. The primary osmotically active solutes that are routinely measured in stool are the electrolytes, specifically the cations sodium ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) and potassium ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$). The total osmolality is the sum of the osmolalities contributed by all solutes:\n$$O_{meas} = O_{electrolytes} + O_{other\\_solutes}$$\nwhere $O_{other\\_solutes}$ represents the contribution from all unmeasured solutes.\n\nTo estimate the osmotic contribution from electrolytes, $O_{electrolytes}$, we consider the major measured cations, $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}]$ and $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}]$. To maintain electroneutrality, these cations must be accompanied by an equivalent amount of anions (e.g., $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, $\\mathrm{HCO}_3^{-}$, organic anions). A standard clinical approximation assumes that the sum of the major cation concentrations, $([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}])$, is approximately half of the total concentration of all electrolyte particles. This approximation is valid when $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ are the dominant cations and are primarily balanced by monovalent anions. Therefore, the estimated electrolyte osmolality, $O_{est}$, is given by:\n$$O_{est} = 2 \\times ([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}])$$\nThis calculated value represents the portion of the total measured osmolality that can be attributed to the major electrolytes.\n\nThe stool osmotic gap (SOG) is defined as the difference between the measured total osmolality and the estimated electrolyte osmolality. It represents the osmotic contribution of unmeasured, osmotically active substances.\n$$\\text{SOG} = O_{meas} - O_{est}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $O_{est}$, we arrive at the operational formula:\n$$\\text{SOG} = O_{meas} - 2 \\times ([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}]) $$\n\nBefore computation, we must address the units. The concentrations of sodium and potassium are given in millimoles per liter ($\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$), a measure of molarity, while osmolality is given in milliosmoles per kilogram of solvent ($\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$), a measure of molality. For dilute aqueous solutions such as stool water, the density of the solvent (water) is approximately $1$ $\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{L}$. Under this justified approximation, molarity and molality are numerically interchangeable. Thus, we can directly use the given values.\n\nUsing the data provided for this patient:\n- $O_{meas} = 290$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $[\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] = 20$ $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$\n- $[\\mathrm{K}^{+}] = 35$ $\\mathrm{mmol}/\\mathrm{L}$\n\nThe stool osmotic gap is computed as:\n$$\\text{SOG} = 290 - 2 \\times (20 + 35)$$\n$$\\text{SOG} = 290 - 2 \\times (55)$$\n$$\\text{SOG} = 290 - 110$$\n$$\\text{SOG} = 180 \\text{ mOsm/kg}$$\n\n**Part 2: Clinical Interpretation**\n\nThe calculated stool osmotic gap of $180$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$ is significantly elevated. A typical cutoff for defining a high osmotic gap is $> 100$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$, with some sources using a more conservative cutoff of $> 50$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$. This high value indicates that a large fraction of the stool's osmotic activity is due to unmeasured solutes, not electrolytes.\n\nThis finding must be integrated with the other pieces of information:\n1.  **High Osmotic Gap ($180$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$)**: This points towards an osmotic diarrhea, where the diarrhea is driven by the presence of poorly absorbed, osmotically active substances in the intestinal lumen, which draw water into the gut.\n2.  **Acidic Stool pH ($5.4$)**: A stool pH below $6.0$ is indicative of carbohydrate malabsorption. Unabsorbed carbohydrates, such as lactose in this case, pass into the colon where they are fermented by gut flora. This bacterial fermentation produces short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetate, propionate, butyrate) and gases (e.g., $\\mathrm{H}_2$, $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, $\\mathrm{CH}_4$). The accumulation of acidic end products lowers the stool pH.\n3.  **Positive Reducing Substances ($2+$)**: This test detects the presence of reducing sugars in the stool. While lactose itself is a reducing sugar, its malabsorption leads to its presence, and that of its hydrolytic products (glucose and galactose, which are also reducing sugars), in the colon. A positive result confirms carbohydrate malabsorption.\n4.  **Clinical History**: The patient's diarrhea acutely worsened following the reintroduction of a lactose-containing diet. This provides a direct causal link between lactose ingestion and symptom exacerbation. Furthermore, the condition follows a rotavirus infection, a common cause of damage to the small intestine's brush border, where the enzyme lactase is located. This temporary, post-infectious loss of lactase activity is known as secondary lactase deficiency.\n\n**Synthesis and Conclusion:**\nThe combination of a high stool osmotic gap, acidic stool pH, presence of reducing substances, and a clinical history of symptom flare with lactose intake following a viral gastroenteritis forms a coherent and classic picture of **osmotic diarrhea due to secondary lactase deficiency**. The unmeasured osmoles creating the gap are the undigested lactose and its fermentation products, the short-chain fatty acids.\n\nThis pattern is inconsistent with a pure **secretory diarrhea** (e.g., as seen in cholera). In a secretory process, the intestinal epithelium actively secretes electrolytes, and the volume of diarrhea is largely independent of oral intake. The stool osmolality in secretory diarrhea is almost entirely accounted for by the measured electrolytes. Consequently, the stool osmotic gap would be low (typically $< 50$ $\\mathrm{mOsm}/\\mathrm{kg}$), as $O_{meas} \\approx 2 \\times ([\\mathrm{Na}^{+}] + [\\mathrm{K}^{+}])$. The stool pH would be neutral or alkaline, and tests for reducing substances would be negative. The patient's findings are the opposite of this profile.\n\nTherefore, the integrated analysis of the provided data strongly supports a diagnosis of osmotic diarrhea secondary to post-rotavirus lactase deficiency.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an optimal estimate for the dehydration fraction by combining two independent sources of information: a weight-based measurement and a clinical surrogate estimate. The derivation and calculation will proceed by addressing the four specified tasks.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Weight-Based Estimator\nThe problem statement defines the dehydration fraction, which we denote as $D$, as the fraction of baseline body mass lost. The baseline body mass is the pre-illness weight, $W_{0}$, and the current body mass is $W$. The mass lost is the difference $W_{0} - W$.\n\nBased on this definition, the weight-based estimator for the dehydration fraction, denoted $D_w$, is given by the ratio of the mass lost to the baseline mass:\n$$D_w = \\frac{W_{0} - W}{W_{0}} = 1 - \\frac{W}{W_{0}}$$\n\nUsing the provided mean values for the weights, $W_{0} = 9.40\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and $W = 8.60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, we can compute the point estimate for $D_w$:\n$$D_w = \\frac{9.40 - 8.60}{9.40} = \\frac{0.80}{9.40} \\approx 0.085106$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Standard Deviation of the Weight-Based Estimator\nTo find the standard deviation of $D_w$, we use the first-order propagation of uncertainty (the delta method). The estimator $D_w$ is a function of two independent random variables, $W_{0}$ and $W$. The general formula for the variance of a function $f(X, Y)$ of two independent variables $X$ and $Y$ is:\n$$\\sigma_f^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial X}\\right)^2 \\sigma_X^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial Y}\\right)^2 \\sigma_Y^2$$\n\nIn our case, the function is $D_w(W_{0}, W) = 1 - W/W_{0}$. We calculate the partial derivatives with respect to $W_{0}$ and $W$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial D_w}{\\partial W_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W_{0}} \\left(1 - W W_{0}^{-1}\\right) = -W(-1)W_{0}^{-2} = \\frac{W}{W_{0}^2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial D_w}{\\partial W} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial W} \\left(1 - \\frac{W}{W_{0}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{W_{0}}$$\n\nSubstituting these partial derivatives into the variance formula gives the expression for the variance of $D_w$, denoted $\\sigma_{D_w}^2$:\n$$\\sigma_{D_w}^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{W}{W_{0}^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{W_{0}}^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{W_{0}}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{W}^2 = \\frac{W^2}{W_{0}^4} \\sigma_{W_{0}}^2 + \\frac{1}{W_{0}^2} \\sigma_{W}^2$$\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma_{D_w}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$\\sigma_{D_w} = \\sqrt{\\frac{W^2}{W_{0}^4} \\sigma_{W_{0}}^2 + \\frac{1}{W_{0}^2} \\sigma_{W}^2}$$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Combined Optimal Estimate\nWe are given two independent, unbiased estimates of the dehydration fraction, which are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions:\n1.  The weight-based estimate, $D_w$, with variance $\\sigma_{D_w}^2$.\n2.  The clinical surrogate estimate, $D_s$, with a given mean $\\mu_s$ and variance $\\sigma_s^2$.\n\nThe optimal linear unbiased estimate for combining these two sources is the inverse-variance weighted average. The combined estimate, $D_{comb}$, is given by:\n$$D_{comb} = \\frac{w_w D_w + w_s D_s}{w_w + w_s}$$\nwhere the weights $w_w$ and $w_s$ are the precisions (inverse variances) of the respective estimates:\n$$w_w = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{D_w}^2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad w_s = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_s^2}$$\nSubstituting the weights into the formula gives the full expression for the combined estimate:\n$$D_{comb} = \\frac{\\frac{D_w}{\\sigma_{D_w}^2} + \\frac{D_s}{\\sigma_s^2}}{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{D_w}^2} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_s^2}}$$\n\n### 4. Computation of the Final Numerical Value\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived formulas.\nThe givens are:\n- Pre-illness weight: $W_{0} = 9.40\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ with $\\sigma_{W_{0}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Current weight: $W = 8.60\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ with $\\sigma_{W} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Clinical surrogate: $D_s = \\mu_s = 0.080$ with $\\sigma_s = 0.025$.\n\nFirst, we compute the variance of the weight-based estimate, $\\sigma_{D_w}^2$. The partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values of $W$ and $W_0$.\n$$\\sigma_{D_w}^2 \\approx \\frac{(8.60)^2}{(9.40)^4} (0.05)^2 + \\frac{1}{(9.40)^2} (0.10)^2$$\n$$\\sigma_{D_w}^2 \\approx \\frac{73.96}{7807.4896} (0.0025) + \\frac{1}{88.36} (0.01)$$\n$$\\sigma_{D_w}^2 \\approx (9.4729 \\times 10^{-3}) (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + (1.13173 \\times 10^{-2}) (1 \\times 10^{-2})$$\n$$\\sigma_{D_w}^2 \\approx 2.3682 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.13173 \\times 10^{-4} \\approx 1.36855 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nNext, we compute the variance of the clinical surrogate estimate:\n$$\\sigma_s^2 = (0.025)^2 = 0.000625 = 6.25 \\times 10^{-4}$$\n\nNow we find the corresponding precisions (weights):\n$$w_w = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{D_w}^2} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.36855 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 7306.94$$\n$$w_s = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_s^2} = \\frac{1}{6.25 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1600$$\n\nFinally, we compute the combined estimate $D_{comb}$ using the point estimate $D_w \\approx 0.085106$ calculated in Part 1.\n$$D_{comb} \\approx \\frac{D_w w_w + D_s w_s}{w_w + w_s} \\approx \\frac{(0.085106)(7306.94) + (0.080)(1600)}{7306.94 + 1600}$$\n$$D_{comb} \\approx \\frac{621.855 + 128}{8906.94} = \\frac{749.855}{8906.94} \\approx 0.0841885$$\n\nRounding the final result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.08419$.",

The signs (lethargy, tachycardia, hypotension, poor perfusion) and symptoms are internally consistent and align with established medical principles. For a $1.5$-year-old child, the lower limit for normal systolic blood pressure is approximately $70 + (2 \\times 1.5) = 73 \\text{ mmHg}$. A systolic pressure of $60 \\text{ mmHg}$ represents significant hypotension, indicating decompensated shock. The management strategy described—resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid boluses—is the standard of care as defined by evidence-based guidelines such as Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS). The problem correctly distinguishes this from ORT.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary data for a unique solution, most importantly the child's weight ($14.5 \\text{ kg}$). The objective is clearly stated: to calculate the total fluid volume administered based on standard resuscitation protocols.\n- **Objectivity**: The description is clinical and quantitative, devoid of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be furnished.\n\nThe solution requires a two-part response: a physiological rationale followed by a quantitative calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Pathophysiological Indications for IV Bolus versus Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)**\n\nAcute gastroenteritis is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, leading to significant fluid and electrolyte losses through vomiting and diarrhea. These losses initially deplete the extracellular fluid volume, which comprises both the interstitial and intravascular compartments.\n\nOral Rehydration Therapy (ORT) is the cornerstone of treatment for mild to moderate dehydration. ORT leverages the intact sodium-glucose cotransport system (SGLT1) in the enterocytes of the small intestine. An appropriately formulated oral rehydration solution (ORS) provides glucose and sodium in an optimal ratio, which facilitates the coupled transport of sodium, glucose, and subsequently water from the intestinal lumen into the circulation. This process effectively replenishes total body water and electrolyte deficits over several hours.\n\nIntravenous (IV) fluid therapy is reserved for cases where ORT is contraindicated or has failed. The primary indication for emergent IV fluid resuscitation is the presence of shock, a state of circulatory failure resulting in inadequate oxygen delivery to meet the metabolic demands of tissues. The patient in this problem exhibits clear signs of decompensated hypovolemic shock:\n1.  **Hypotension**: A systolic blood pressure of $60 \\text{ mmHg}$ is a late and ominous sign in children, indicating that the body's compensatory mechanisms (e.g., tachycardia, peripheral vasoconstriction) have failed to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion.\n2.  **Altered Mental Status**: Lethargy indicates cerebral hypoperfusion. A child in this state cannot safely participate in ORT and is at risk of aspiration.\n3.  **Poor Perfusion**: Signs such as cool extremities, weak peripheral pulses, and a delayed capillary refill of $4$ seconds are direct clinical indicators of a severely compromised circulatory volume and compensatory peripheral vasoconstriction.\n\nIn the state of shock, the primary physiological goal is the immediate restoration of intravascular volume to re-establish adequate tissue perfusion and prevent irreversible organ damage. ORT is an absorptive process that is too slow to achieve this rapid volume expansion. Therefore, the administration of an isotonic crystalloid bolus directly into the intravascular space is the required life-saving intervention. Isotonic fluids (e.g., 0.9% sodium chloride or Lactated Ringer's solution) have a tonicity similar to that of plasma and distribute primarily throughout the extracellular space, rapidly expanding the intravascular volume.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Cumulative Fluid Volume**\n\nThe management of a child in hypotensive hypovolemic shock follows well-established resuscitation protocols. The standard of care, as outlined by PALS and other pediatric guidelines, for a child without underlying cardiac or renal disease is the rapid administration of an isotonic crystalloid bolus.\n\nThe standard volume for an initial fluid bolus in this context is $20$ milliliters per kilogram ($20 \\text{ mL/kg}$) of body weight, typically administered over $5$ to $20$ minutes.\n\nGiven the child's estimated body weight, $W = 14.5 \\text{ kg}$, the volume of the initial single bolus, $V_{1}$, is calculated as:\n$$V_{1} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times W$$\n$$V_{1} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 14.5 \\text{ kg} = 290 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThe problem states that after the first bolus, the child remains hypotensive and poorly perfused. This clinical finding is a clear indication for the administration of a second fluid bolus. According to standard protocols, this second bolus should be identical in volume to the first.\nTherefore, the volume of the second bolus, $V_{2}$, is:\n$$V_{2} = V_{1} = 290 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThe cumulative volume of isotonic IV crystalloid delivered, $V_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the volumes of the two boluses.\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = V_{1} + V_{2}$$\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 290 \\text{ mL} + 290 \\text{ mL} = 580 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThis cumulative volume of $40 \\text{ mL/kg}$ ($580 \\text{ mL} / 14.5 \\text{ kg}$) is consistent with aggressive fluid resuscitation for severe shock. The subsequent clinical improvement validates this therapeutic approach.",
