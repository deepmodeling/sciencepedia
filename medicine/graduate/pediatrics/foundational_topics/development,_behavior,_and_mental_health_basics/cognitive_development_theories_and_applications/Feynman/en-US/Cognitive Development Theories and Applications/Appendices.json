Clinicians and researchers often use statistical models to quantify the impact of perinatal variables, such as gestational age and birth weight, on later outcomes.

Each subtest yields a scaled score that has been normed to a mean of $10$ and a standard deviation of $3$ in the reference population for this age band. The clinic’s procedure is to: (i) convert each scaled score to a percentile rank using an age-band normative table, (ii) transform each percentile rank to a standard normal deviate (a $z$-score) using the inverse cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, and (iii) form a weighted composite from the three correlated $z$-scores, then standardize that composite to a $z$-metric using the known inter-subtest correlation structure.
