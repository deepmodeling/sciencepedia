            "problem": "A neonatal unit implements universal screening for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) using a standardized ultrasound assessment at age $4$ weeks, with confirmatory diagnosis established by a pediatric orthopedic reference standard at $6$ months. In a birth cohort of $8000$ infants, the following screening outcomes were observed when compared against the reference standard for DDH (present versus absent):\n\n- Screen positive and DDH present: $90$.\n- Screen positive and DDH absent: $210$.\n- Screen negative and DDH present: $30$.\n- Screen negative and DDH absent: $7670$.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions of diagnostic test performance grounded in conditional probabilities and frequency-based reasoning, do the following:\n\n1. Calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) as decimals (do not use percentage notation). Your derivations must start from the definitions of conditional probability and the $2 \\times 2$ frequency table structure.\n\n2. Derive the positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) from the sensitivity and specificity, and confirm the PPV and NPV by applying Bayes’ theorem via odds form, using the cohort’s observed prevalence as the pretest probability.\n\n3.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or violations of scientific fact. A unique, meaningful solution can be derived from the provided data.\n\nThe first step is to organize the given data into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, which cross-classifies the screening test result (Positive, $T^+$, or Negative, $T^-$) against the true disease status (DDH Present, $D^+$, or DDH Absent, $D^-$).\n\nThe given frequencies are:\n- True Positives ($TP$): Screen positive and DDH present. $TP = 90$.\n- False Positives ($FP$): Screen positive and DDH absent. $FP = 210$.\n- False Negatives ($FN$): Screen negative and DDH present. $FN = 30$.\n- True Negatives ($TN$): Screen negative and DDH absent. $TN = 7670$.\n\nWe can now construct the contingency table and calculate the marginal totals.\n\n| | DDH Present ($D^+$) | DDH Absent ($D^-$) | Total |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| **Screen Positive ($T^+$)** | $TP=90$ | $FP=210$ | $TP+FP=300$ |\n| **Screen Negative ($T^-$)** | $FN=30$ | $TN=7670$ | $FN+TN=7700$ |\n| **Total** | $TP+FN=120$ | $FP+TN=7880$ | $N=8000$ |\n\nThe total number of infants with DDH is $D_{\\text{total}}^+ = TP + FN = 90 + 30 = 120$.\nThe total number of infants without DDH is $D_{\\text{total}}^- = FP + TN = 210 + 7670 = 7880$.\nThe total number of infants screening positive is $T_{\\text{total}}^+ = TP + FP = 90 + 210 = 300$.\nThe total number of infants screening negative is $T_{\\text{total}}^- = FN + TN = 30 + 7670 = 7700$.\nThe total cohort size is $N = TP + FP + FN + TN = 90 + 210 + 30 + 7670 = 8000$.\n\n**1. Calculation of Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, and NPV**\n\nThese metrics are defined as conditional probabilities.\n\nSensitivity (Sen) is the probability of a positive test given that the disease is present, $P(T^+|D^+)$.\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN} = \\frac{90}{120} = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75\n$$\n\nSpecificity (Spe) is the probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent, $P(T^-|D^-)$.\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP} = \\frac{7670}{7670 + 210} = \\frac{7670}{7880} = \\frac{767}{788} \\approx 0.97335\n$$\n\nPositive Predictive Value (PPV) is the probability that the disease is present given a positive test, $P(D^+|T^+)$.\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{90}{90 + 210} = \\frac{90}{300} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n$$\n\nNegative Predictive Value (NPV) is the probability that the disease is absent given a negative test, $P(D^-|T^-)$.\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FN} = \\frac{7670}{7670 + 30} = \\frac{7670}{7700} = \\frac{767}{770} \\approx 0.99610\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of Likelihood Ratios and Confirmation via Bayes' Theorem**\n\nFirst, we derive the likelihood ratios from sensitivity and specificity.\n\nThe positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$) is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in the diseased group to the probability of a positive test in the non-diseased group.\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+|D^+)}{P(T^+|D^-)} = \\frac{\\text{Sensitivity}}{1 - \\text{Specificity}}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\n1 - \\text{Specificity} = 1 - \\frac{7670}{7880} = \\frac{7880 - 7670}{7880} = \\frac{210}{7880} = \\frac{21}{788}\n$$\n$$\nLR^+ = \\frac{0.75}{210/7880} = \\frac{3/4}{21/788} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times \\frac{788}{21} = \\frac{788}{4 \\times 7} = \\frac{788}{28} = \\frac{197}{7} \\approx 28.14\n$$\n\nThe negative likelihood ratio ($LR^-$) is the ratio of the probability of a negative test in the diseased group to the probability of a negative test in the non-diseased group.\n$$\nLR^- = \\frac{P(T^-|D^+)}{P(T^-|D^-)} = \\frac{1 - \\text{Sensitivity}}{\\text{Specificity}}\n$$\nUsing the calculated values:\n$$\n1 - \\text{Sensitivity} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nLR^- = \\frac{0.25}{7670/7880} = \\frac{1/4}{767/788} = \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{788}{767} = \\frac{197}{767} \\approx 0.2568\n$$\n\nNext, we apply Bayes' theorem in odds form: Post-test odds = Pre-test odds $\\times$ LR.\n\nThe pre-test probability of DDH is the prevalence in the cohort.\n$$\nP(\\text{Pre-test}) = P(D^+) = \\frac{TP + FN}{N} = \\frac{120}{8000} = \\frac{12}{800} = \\frac{3}{200} = 0.015\n$$\nThe pre-test odds of DDH are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) = \\frac{P(D^+)}{1 - P(D^+)} = \\frac{0.015}{1 - 0.015} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985} = \\frac{15}{985} = \\frac{3}{197}\n$$\n\nTo confirm PPV, we calculate the post-test odds given a positive test:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+) = \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) \\times LR^+ = \\frac{3}{197} \\times \\frac{197}{7} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nConvert post-test odds to probability (which is the PPV):\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D^+|T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^+)} = \\frac{3/7}{1 + 3/7} = \\frac{3/7}{10/7} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n$$\nThis matches the value of PPV calculated directly, confirming the result.\n\nTo confirm NPV, we calculate the post-test odds of disease given a negative test:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^-) = \\text{Odds}(\\text{Pre-test}) \\times LR^- = \\frac{3}{197} \\times \\frac{197}{767} = \\frac{3}{767}\n$$\nThis is the odds of having the disease despite a negative test. The corresponding probability is $P(D^+|T^-)$:\n$$\nP(D^+|T^-) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^-)}{1 + \\text{Odds}(\\text{Post-test, } T^-)} = \\frac{3/767}{1 + 3/767} = \\frac{3/767}{770/767} = \\frac{3}{770}\n$$\nThis probability is $1 - \\text{NPV}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^-|T^-) = 1 - P(D^+|T^-) = 1 - \\frac{3}{770} = \\frac{767}{770}\n$$\nThis matches the value of NPV calculated directly, confirming the result.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Summary Discriminative Performance Metric**\n\nThe problem defines this metric as the difference between the sum of sensitivity and specificity and $1$. This is also known as Youden's J statistic.\n$$\nJ = \\text{Sensitivity} + \\text{Specificity} - 1\n$$\nSubstituting the derived exact values:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{90}{120} + \\frac{7670}{7880} - 1 = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{767}{788} - 1\n$$\nTo compute the numerical value:\n$$\nJ = 0.75 + 0.9733502538... - 1 = 1.7233502538... - 1 = 0.7233502538...\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures, we get $0.7234$.\n\nA brief qualitative interpretation of the clinical implications:\nThe sensitivity of $0.75$ means the screen misses $25\\%$ of infants with DDH ($30$ cases in this cohort), who are at risk for delayed diagnosis and more complex treatment. The specificity is high at approximately $0.973$, meaning the test correctly identifies most healthy infants. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) is low at $0.30$. This indicates that out of $10$ infants who screen positive and are sent for orthopedic evaluation, $7$ are actually healthy (false positives). This creates parental anxiety and incurs additional healthcare costs. In contrast, the negative predictive value (NPV) is very high at approximately $0.996$, providing strong reassurance that an infant with a negative screen is highly unlikely to have DDH. The core clinical trade-off is between the harm of missing cases ($FN=30$) and the burden of over-investigating healthy infants due to false positives ($FP=210$). The low prevalence of the disease ($1.5\\%$) is a major factor driving the low PPV.",

            "problem": "A term female infant, born breech, presents at age $4$ weeks for evaluation of suspected developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). On clinical examination, the left hip is Barlow positive with a palpable clunk under posterior stress; the Ortolani maneuver yields a smooth reduction in flexion and abduction. Ultrasound using a coronal neutral view shows a normal Graf alpha angle of $65^\\circ$ bilaterally, with a well-formed, echogenic bony acetabular roof and no fragmentation of the cartilaginous rim. Dynamic stress ultrasound (posterior push–pull) performed in the longitudinal view demonstrates a decrease in femoral head coverage from $60\\%$ at rest to $20\\%$ under gentle posterior stress on the left, with immediate spontaneous reduction upon release. There is no evidence of teratologic dislocation, and there are no neuromuscular signs.\n\nWhich option best reconciles the normal alpha angle with the abnormal dynamic subluxation and provides the most appropriate immediate management principle?\n\nA. The normal alpha angle confirms adequate acetabular development and excludes clinically significant instability; observation without intervention is indicated, as stress-induced translation is within normal neonatal laxity.\n\nB.

A normal alpha angle in the presence of dynamic subluxation implies a nonreducing mechanical block by the labrum; immediate open reduction is indicated to prevent iatrogenic avascular necrosis.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid clinical scenario that tests the core principles of diagnosing and managing developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). The case is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. The data provided are consistent with a known clinical presentation.\n\n**Derivation of Principles**\n\nThe patient is a $4$-week-old infant with a positive Barlow sign, which is a definitive clinical sign of a dislocatable, unstable hip. The risk factors of female sex and breech birth further increase the index of suspicion for DDH.\n\nThe investigation involves two key ultrasound components: static morphology and dynamic stability.\n\n1.  **Static Morphology (Graf Method)**: The Graf alpha angle ($\\alpha$) measures the inclination of the bony acetabular roof. An angle of $65^\\circ$ corresponds to a Graf Type I hip, which is considered morphologically mature and normal. This means the osseous (bony) structure of the hip socket is well-formed at the time of the examination.\n\n2.  **Dynamic Stability (Harcke Method/Stress Views)**: Dynamic ultrasound assesses the functional stability of the hip joint. Femoral head coverage quantifies the percentage of the femoral head that is covered by the acetabulum. A decrease in femoral head coverage from $60\\%$ at rest to $20\\%$ under posterior stress signifies severe instability. The femoral head is easily pushed out of the socket (subluxated). This sonographic finding confirms the clinical Barlow sign.\n\nThe central task is to reconcile these two findings. A morphologically normal bony socket ($\\alpha > 60^\\circ$) can coexist with significant clinical and sonographic instability. This is because hip stability in an infant is provided not only by the bony geometry but also by the soft tissue constraints: the cartilaginous labrum and the joint capsule with its ligaments. In early infancy, physiologic ligamentous laxity, which can be exacerbated by maternal hormones or genetic predisposition, may lead to capsular laxity that is insufficient to contain the femoral head, even in a well-shaped acetabulum.\n\nThe primary goal of DDH management in infants is to ensure stable, concentric reduction of the femoral head within the acetabulum. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle (pressure inhibits growth, tension stimulates growth), a well-centered femoral head provides the necessary mechanical stimulus for the acetabulum to develop normally. An unstable hip, regardless of its initial bony morphology, will lead to abnormal pressure distribution and subsequent maldevelopment (secondary acetabular dysplasia). Therefore, functional instability is the primary indication for treatment in this age group.\n\nFor an unstable but reducible hip in an infant younger than $6$ months, the standard first-line treatment is a dynamic flexion-abduction orthosis, the most common of which is the Pavlik harness. This device maintains the hip in a stable position, allowing the lax capsule to tighten and promoting normal acetabular development. Close follow-up, typically with ultrasound within $1-2$ weeks, is essential to confirm the effectiveness of the harness in maintaining reduction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The normal alpha angle confirms adequate acetabular development and excludes clinically significant instability; observation without intervention is indicated, as stress-induced translation is within normal neonatal laxity.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. A normal alpha angle does not exclude instability. The clinical exam (Barlow positive) and dynamic ultrasound ($40\\%$ change in coverage) unequivocally demonstrate clinically significant instability. Attributing this to \"normal neonatal laxity\" and recommending observation would be a serious mismanagement of a pathologically unstable hip.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. The alpha angle measures static osseous morphology, whereas dynamic subluxation reveals functional capsulolabral instability; stability governs early management to ensure concentric reduction for remodeling, so initiate a Pavlik harness and reassess stability with ultrasound within $1$ week.**\nThis option provides a perfect reconciliation of the findings. It correctly differentiates between static morphology (alpha angle) and functional stability (dynamic assessment). It correctly asserts that stability is the paramount factor governing treatment in early infancy to guide proper joint development. The proposed management—initiation of a Pavlik harness and prompt follow-up—is the standard of care for this specific clinical presentation.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. The discrepancy is best explained by sonographer measurement error; a repeat static morphology assessment (alpha angle and beta angle) without stress testing is sufficient, and no treatment is required unless alpha angle declines below $60^\\circ$.**\nDismissing a finding that is corroborated by the physical exam as measurement error is poor practice. The clinical Barlow sign is a strong independent finding of instability. Ignoring the dynamic assessment, which is the key to understanding the hip's function, is inappropriate. Waiting for the alpha angle to deteriorate means waiting for bony damage to occur, which is precisely what early treatment aims to prevent.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Morphology supersedes stability in early infancy; a normal alpha angle permits deferring all intervention until a pelvic radiograph at $6$ months to measure the acetabular index, at which point treatment decisions can be made.**\nThis statement reverses the established etiological principle. Stability guides morphological development, not the other way around. A stable concentric reduction is necessary for the acetabulum to mature correctly. Deferring treatment of a proven unstable hip for several months is the antithesis of best practice and risks creating a more severe, harder-to-treat deformity. Furthermore, ultrasound, not radiography, is the imaging modality of choice for infants under $4-6$ months.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. A normal alpha angle in the presence of dynamic subluxation implies a nonreducing mechanical block by the labrum; immediate open reduction is indicated to prevent iatrogenic avascular necrosis.**\nThis option fundamentally misinterprets the clinical data. The problem states the hip has a \"smooth reduction\" on Ortolani maneuver and shows \"spontaneous reduction\" on ultrasound. This describes a reducible hip, not an irreducible one. A mechanical block (e.g., inverted labrum) would cause an irreducible dislocation. Open reduction is a highly invasive procedure reserved for cases where closed methods fail and is not indicated here. The reasoning regarding avascular necrosis is also flawed; open reduction carries its own significant risk of AVN.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.",

You will reason from the first principles of endochondral ossification to explain the complete clinical and radiological picture of DDH in an older infant with a late-appearing femoral head ossification center .

            "problem": "A $7$-month-old breech female infant is referred for concern of asymmetric thigh folds and limited hip abduction. She has no fever, redness, or systemic symptoms. On clinical examination, Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers are negative bilaterally, but hip abduction is restricted on the left compared with the right. Radiographs show an absent femoral head ossification center on the left, while the right femoral head ossification center is present. The acetabular roof on the left appears shallow with lateral displacement of the proximal femoral metaphysis, and the contour continuity between the inferior pubic ramus and medial proximal femur is disrupted. Ultrasound demonstrates a cartilaginous femoral head that appears decentered in the acetabulum on the left. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered but deferred.\n\nUsing as fundamental base the sequence of endochondral ossification—formation of a cartilage template, chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy, matrix mineralization, vascular invasion, and replacement with lamellar bone—and the well-tested observations that radiographs detect mineralized tissue while ultrasound resolves cartilaginous structures, reason from first principles how a disruption leading to a late-appearing proximal femoral ossification center would be expected to present on imaging and clinical examination in developmental dysplasia of the hip. Which of the following integrated predictions is most consistent with this mechanistic framework?\n\nA. Absent femoral head ossific nucleus on the affected side will make radiographs underestimate lateralization; acetabular roof appears shallow with disruption of the smooth arcuate contour of the medial hip; ultrasound remains informative because it visualizes cartilage; clinically, after about $3$ months, limited abduction is more likely than a positive Ortolani or Barlow maneuver.\n\nB. Ultrasound becomes unreliable beyond $3$ months because cartilaginous structures are no longer visible; radiographs are definitive and will show normal acetabular morphology despite a late ossification center; clinically, Ortolani remains the most sensitive sign at $7$ months.\n\nC. MRI would directly demonstrate delayed vascular invasion into the epiphysis; radiographs will appear normal if the hip is reduced, and the acetabular roof will be deep despite disruption of endochondral ossification; clinically, asymmetric thigh folds with a positive Galeazzi sign are expected in unilateral involvement.\n\nD. Disruption of endochondral ossification in this setting causes premature physeal closure that appears as a sclerotic band across the growth plate on radiographs; clinically, painless full abduction with normal gait is typical.\n\nE. A fragmented femoral head ossific nucleus on radiographs invariably occurs with late ossification; clinically, hyperabduction is expected due to capsular laxity in older infants.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in understanding the interplay between mechanical environment and biological development, as observed through different imaging techniques.\n\n1.  **Pathophysiology of DDH and Endochondral Ossification:**\n    - Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is characterized by an abnormal relationship between the femoral head and the acetabulum. For normal hip development, the spherical femoral head must be deeply and concentrically seated within the acetabulum. This stable, congruent joint provides the necessary mechanical stimulus for both the ossification of the femoral head and the development of the cup-shaped acetabulum.\n    - The proximal femoral head is initially a cartilage anlage. Its conversion to bone via endochondral ossification requires, among other things, adequate vascular invasion. In a subluxated or dislocated hip, the abnormal position and forces can compromise the blood supply to the epiphysis. This leads to a delay in the appearance of the secondary ossification center. Thus, a late-appearing or absent ossific nucleus is a direct, expected consequence of the pathological mechanics of DDH.\n\n2.  **Imaging Manifestations:**\n    - **Radiographs (X-rays):** Radiographs detect high-density, mineralized tissue (bone). They are insensitive to cartilage. In a $7$-month-old, the femoral head ossific nucleus is typically present (usually appears between $2$ and $8$ months). In the case of DDH with delayed ossification, the radiograph will show an absent ossific nucleus on the affected side. The position of the hip joint must be inferred indirectly by observing the position of the visible proximal femoral *metaphysis* relative to the pelvic landmarks (e.g., Hilgenreiner's line, Perkin's line). Because the radiolucent cartilaginous head is what is actually displaced, using the more medially located metaphysis as a proxy can lead to an *underestimation* of the true degree of lateral displacement. The lack of a well-seated femoral head to mold the acetabulum results in secondary dysplasia: the acetabular roof fails to develop properly and appears shallow and steep (increased acetabular index). The disruption of Shenton's line (a smooth arc from the medial aspect of the femoral neck to the inferior border of the superior pubic ramus) is a direct sign of the superolateral displacement of the femur.\n    - **Ultrasound:** Ultrasound uses sound waves to image soft tissues and is excellent for visualizing cartilage. It is the modality of choice for DDH in infants before significant ossification obscures the view (typically up to age $4-6$ months). Even at $7$ months, if the ossific nucleus is absent, ultrasound remains highly informative. It can directly visualize the unossified, cartilaginous femoral head, assess its size and morphology, and, most importantly, determine its position and stability relative to the acetabulum in real-time. It directly confirms that the \"missing\" head on the radiograph is actually present but cartilaginous and decentered.\n\n3.  **Clinical Manifestations:**\n    - The Ortolani (relocating a dislocated hip) and Barlow (dislocating a dislocatable hip) maneuvers test for joint *instability*. They are most reliable in the neonatal period (first $2-3$ months) when the joint capsule and surrounding tissues are lax.\n    - By the age of $7$ months, a chronically dislocated or subluxated hip often leads to the development of soft-tissue contractures, particularly of the adductor and iliopsoas muscles. The joint capsule also tightens. As a result, the hip becomes \"stuck\" in its abnormal position and is no longer easily reducible or dislocatable. Therefore, the Ortolani and Barlow signs become negative. The most reliable clinical sign at this age is a *limitation of passive hip abduction* (typically to less than $60^\\circ$) due to the adductor muscle contracture. Other signs like asymmetric thigh folds and the Galeazzi sign (apparent limb length discrepancy when hips and knees are flexed) become more prominent.\n\n**Integrated Prediction:**\nA $7$-month-old with DDH would be expected to have a delayed ossific nucleus due to abnormal hip mechanics. Radiographs would show this absence, along with secondary acetabular shallowness and a broken Shenton's line, while potentially underestimating the true displacement. Ultrasound would remain key to visualize the decentered cartilaginous head. Clinically, the provocative instability tests (Ortolani/Barlow) would likely be negative, replaced by fixed signs like limited abduction.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Absent femoral head ossific nucleus on the affected side will make radiographs underestimate lateralization; acetabular roof appears shallow with disruption of the smooth arcuate contour of the medial hip; ultrasound remains informative because it visualizes cartilage; clinically, after about $3$ months, limited abduction is more likely than a positive Ortolani or Barlow maneuver.**\n- This option correctly states that radiographs can underestimate lateralization.\n- It correctly describes the secondary radiographic findings of a shallow acetabulum and disrupted Shenton's line (\"smooth arcuate contour\").\n- It correctly identifies the continued utility of ultrasound for visualizing the cartilaginous anatomy.\n- It correctly describes the evolution of clinical signs from instability (positive Ortolani/Barlow) to fixed contracture (limited abduction) after the first few months of life.\n- **Verdict:** All components of this statement are accurate and consistent with the derived principles. **Correct**.\n\n**B. Ultrasound becomes unreliable beyond $3$ months because cartilaginous structures are no longer visible; radiographs are definitive and will show normal acetabular morphology despite a late ossification center; clinically, Ortolani remains the most sensitive sign at $7$ months.**\n- \"Ultrasound becomes unreliable beyond $3$ months because cartilaginous structures are no longer visible\" is false. Ultrasound is the preferred modality in early infancy *precisely because* it visualizes cartilage. It becomes less useful as the ossific nucleus grows and creates an acoustic shadow, but in this case with an absent nucleus, it is exceptionally useful.\n- \"radiographs... will show normal acetabular morphology\" is false. Chronic malposition of the femoral head causes secondary acetabular dysplasia (shallowing).\n- \"Ortolani remains the most sensitive sign at $7$ months\" is false. Limited abduction is the more reliable sign at this age.\n- **Verdict:** This option contains multiple significant errors. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. MRI would directly demonstrate delayed vascular invasion into the epiphysis; radiographs will appear normal if the hip is reduced, and the acetabular roof will be deep despite disruption of endochondral ossification; clinically, asymmetric thigh folds with a positive Galeazzi sign are expected in unilateral involvement.**\n- \"radiographs will appear normal if the hip is reduced\" is false. The delayed ossification is itself an abnormality visible on radiographs. Furthermore, the hip in this case is not reduced.\n- \"the acetabular roof will be deep\" is false. The roof becomes shallow due to lack of molding.\n- The clinical statement about thigh folds and Galeazzi sign is plausible, but the radiographic statements are fundamentally incorrect.\n- **Verdict:** The description of radiographic findings is contrary to established pathophysiology. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Disruption of endochondral ossification in this setting causes premature physeal closure that appears as a sclerotic band across the growth plate on radiographs; clinically, painless full abduction with normal gait is typical.**\n- \"premature physeal closure\" is not a feature of DDH. DDH affects the epiphyseal ossification center, not primarily the physis (growth plate) in this manner.\n- \"painless full abduction\" is false. The key sign is *limited* abduction.\n- \"normal gait\" is irrelevant for a non-ambulatory $7$-month-old and would be false in a walking child with DDH (who would likely have a Trendelenburg gait).\n- **Verdict:** The pathophysiological and clinical descriptions are entirely wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A fragmented femoral head ossific nucleus on radiographs invariably occurs with late ossification; clinically, hyperabduction is expected due to capsular laxity in older infants.**\n- \"A fragmented femoral head ossific nucleus... invariably occurs\" is false.
