            "problem": "A child aged $6$ years is evaluated for recurrent mucosal infections. The measured serum concentration of Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is reported by the laboratory as $0.07$ $\\mathrm{g/L}$. For patients older than $4$ years, the widely accepted diagnostic definition of selective IgA deficiency is a serum IgA concentration strictly less than $7$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, with normal Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and exclusion of secondary causes; in this task, focus only on the unit conversion and the numerical comparison to the threshold.\n\nStarting from the base definitions of the International System of Units (SI), namely $1$ $\\mathrm{g} = 10^{3}$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ and $1$ $\\mathrm{L} = 10$ $\\mathrm{dL}$, convert the reported IgA value from $\\mathrm{g/L}$ to $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Then compute the comparison metric defined as the difference\n$$\n\\Delta = C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} - C_{\\mathrm{th}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})},\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})}$ is the converted IgA concentration in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{th}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})}$ is the diagnostic threshold $7$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Express the final value of $\\Delta$ in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard clinical scenario requiring unit conversion and comparison, which are fundamental operations in quantitative sciences. All data and definitions required for the solution are provided and are consistent.\n\nThe objective is to compute a comparison metric, $\\Delta$, which is the difference between a patient's measured serum Immunoglobulin A (IgA) concentration and the diagnostic threshold for selective IgA deficiency. To do this, we must first express both quantities in the same units.\n\nThe given data are:\n1.  The measured serum IgA concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{IgA}} = 0.07 \\ \\mathrm{g/L}$.\n2.  The diagnostic threshold concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{th}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} = 7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n3.  The conversion factors from the International System of Units (SI): $1 \\ \\mathrm{g} = 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}$ and $1 \\ \\mathrm{L} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}$.\n\nThe first step is to convert the measured IgA concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}$, from units of grams per liter ($\\mathrm{g/L}$) to milligrams per deciliter ($\\mathrm{mg/dL}$). We can construct conversion factors from the given definitions, ensuring that each factor is a dimensionless quantity equal to $1$.\n\nThe conversion factor for mass is $\\frac{10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}} = 1$.\nThe conversion factor for volume is $\\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}} = 1$.\n\nWe multiply the reported concentration by these factors to change the units without changing the physical value:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} = C_{\\mathrm{IgA}} \\times \\left( \\frac{10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given value of $C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} = 0.07 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}} \\times \\frac{10^3 \\ \\mathrm{mg}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{g}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{L}}{10 \\ \\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nThe units of grams ($\\mathrm{g}$) and liters ($\\mathrm{L}$) cancel out, leaving the desired units of $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} = 0.07 \\times \\frac{10^3}{10} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nWe perform the arithmetic calculation:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} = 0.07 \\times 10^2 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}} = 7 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{dL}}\n$$\nSo, the child's serum IgA concentration is exactly $7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nThe second step is to compute the comparison metric $\\Delta$, defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta = C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} - C_{\\mathrm{th}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})}\n$$\nWe substitute the converted value of the patient's IgA concentration and the given threshold value:\n$$\n\\Delta = 7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL} - 7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}\n$$\nThe difference is $0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This result signifies that the patient's IgA level is exactly at the diagnostic threshold. It should be noted that the diagnostic criterion for selective IgA deficiency is a concentration *strictly less than* $7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Since the patient's concentration is $7 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$, the condition $C_{\\mathrm{IgA}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})} < C_{\\mathrm{th}}^{(\\mathrm{mg/dL})}$ is not met. The value of $\\Delta = 0$ confirms this, as a negative value for $\\Delta$ would be required to meet the criterion.\n\nThe problem asks for the final value of $\\Delta$ in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.",

            "problem": "A $5$-year-old child presents with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media. Laboratory evaluation shows persistently low serum Immunoglobulin A (IgA) on two separate measurements $6$ weeks apart, with values of $3$ mg/dL and $4$ mg/dL, respectively. Serum Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) are within age-adjusted reference ranges (both within $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$ for age). The child has adequate serotype-specific antipneumococcal IgG titers (protective titers $\\ge 1.3$ $\\mu$g/mL for $\\ge 50\\%$ of tested serotypes at baseline and a post-immunization response with $\\ge 2$-fold rise in the majority of assayed serotypes) and protective tetanus antitoxin levels ($\\ge 0.1$ IU/mL). Lymphocyte subset analysis shows normal B-cell and T-cell numbers. There is no history or evidence of protein-losing enteropathy, nephrotic syndrome, systemic corticosteroid use, anticonvulsant therapy, or other secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. Physical examination is unremarkable between infections, growth is normal, and there are no chronic gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\nUsing fundamental immunologic principles—namely, that mucosal immunity is mediated predominantly by polymeric IgA produced by B cells after class-switch recombination, that serum immunoglobulin concentrations are age-dependent and follow population distributions with variability captured by $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, and that functional humoral competence can be inferred from antigen-specific IgG responses to protein and polysaccharide vaccines—select the most scientifically sound reasoning path to confirm a diagnosis of selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency in this child while avoiding common diagnostic pitfalls.\n\nA. Diagnose selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency immediately based on one low serum IgA result in a child with recurrent mucosal infections; further testing (repeat levels, vaccine responses, or secondary cause evaluation) is unnecessary.\n\nB. Confirm selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency by demonstrating persistently low serum IgA ($< 7$ mg/dL) on at least two occasions after age $\\ge 4$ years, with normal age-adjusted IgG and IgM, intact specific antibody responses to both protein and polysaccharide antigens, normal lymphocyte subsets, and exclusion of secondary causes; do not pursue secretory IgA assays, as serum criteria suffice.\n\nC. Diagnose Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID) because recurrent infections are present; initiate Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) replacement therapy to correct the humoral defect despite normal IgG and specific antibody titers.\n\nD. Order salivary and stool secretory IgA measurements to confirm mucosal IgA deficiency because serum IgA may not reflect mucosal immunity; reserve diagnosis until secretory IgA is quantified.\n\nE. Proceed with genetic testing for Transmembrane Activator and CAML Interactor (TNFRSF13B, TACI) mutations as a required confirmatory step for selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency; diagnosis cannot be made without genotyping.",
            "solution": "Begin from first principles relevant to humoral and mucosal immunity:\n\n1. B cells undergo class-switch recombination under T-cell help and cytokine signals to produce different isotypes. Immunoglobulin A (IgA), particularly polymeric IgA, is the dominant antibody at mucosal surfaces, transcytosed via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor to form secretory IgA, which neutralizes pathogens at the mucosa.\n\n2. Serum immunoglobulin concentrations are age-dependent. IgA rises slowly through early childhood. A single measurement below the reference interval in very young children can be physiologic. Population distributions for immunoglobulins imply that reference ranges are typically set around $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$ for age; persistent deviation below the lower bound is more likely pathological.\n\n3. Functional humoral competence is assessed by specific antibody responses to antigens. Adequate responses to protein antigens (e.g., tetanus toxoid) and polysaccharide antigens (e.g., pneumococcal serotypes) indicate intact IgG production and B-cell function. Adequate baseline protective titers (e.g., antipneumococcal $\\ge 1.3$ $\\mu$g/mL for $\\ge 50\\%$ serotypes) and appropriate post-immunization rises (e.g., $\\ge 2$-fold for the majority) are consistent with normal function.\n\n4. The accepted diagnostic definition for selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency requires: age $\\ge 4$ years, serum IgA $< 7$ mg/dL, normal IgG and IgM for age, normal specific antibody responses, and exclusion of secondary causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. Secretory IgA testing is not part of standard diagnostic criteria, and genotyping is not required.\n\nApply these principles to the case:\n\n- The child is $5$ years old (meets the age criterion $\\ge 4$ years).\n- Serum IgA is persistently low on two occasions ($3$ mg/dL and $4$ mg/dL, both $< 7$ mg/dL), satisfying the biochemical threshold and persistence requirement.\n- IgG and IgM are within age-adjusted $\\mu \\pm 2\\sigma$, indicating no global hypogammaglobulinemia.\n- Specific antibody responses to protein (tetanus) and polysaccharide (pneumococcal) antigens are adequate, which supports intact humoral function and argues against Common Variable Immunodeficiency and Specific Antibody Deficiency.\n- Lymphocyte subsets are normal, and secondary causes have been excluded. Therefore, by definition, the diagnosis of selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency is established without the need for secretory IgA assays or genetic testing.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option recommends diagnosing based on a single low IgA measurement and clinical history alone, without repeat confirmation, age consideration, functional assessment, or exclusion of secondary causes. From first principles and consensus criteria, transient low IgA or laboratory error can occur; age-dependent maturation must be considered. A single value does not suffice, and recurrent infections are nonspecific. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nB. This option enumerates the core diagnostic elements derived from first principles and accepted criteria: persistent serum IgA $< 7$ mg/dL on two occasions, age $\\ge 4$ years (to avoid physiologic low IgA), normal IgG/IgM, intact antigen-specific responses indicating functional humoral competence, normal lymphocyte subsets, and exclusion of secondary causes. It also correctly notes that secretory IgA assays are not required to establish the diagnosis. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. CVID requires reduced IgG and poor specific antibody responses; initiating IVIG for isolated low IgA with normal IgG and intact vaccine responses contravenes the principle that therapy should match the defect. Moreover, IVIG does not replace IgA and is not indicated for isolated selective IgA deficiency in the absence of severe, recurrent infections unresponsive to other measures. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. While secretory IgA mediates mucosal immunity, standard diagnostic criteria for selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency rely on serum immunoglobulin measurements and functional antibody responses, not secretory IgA quantification. Secretory assays are variable, poorly standardized, and unnecessary for confirmation. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. Genetic variants (e.g., TNFRSF13B/TACI) can be associated with humoral deficiencies, but genotyping is not required to diagnose selective Immunoglobulin A deficiency and is not definitive. Diagnosis is clinical and biochemical per established criteria. Verdict: Incorrect.",

Over the past $2$ years, he has had $3$ episodes of radiographically confirmed lobar pneumonia requiring antibiotics, interspersed with frequent otitis media and chronic rhinosinusitis. He completed his primary immunization series including the $13$-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV$13$). Because of recurrent sinopulmonary infections, he received the $23$-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV$23$) at age $7$ years.\n\nSpecific anti-pneumococcal serotype titers were measured: prior to PPSV$23$, he had protective titers to $3$ of $23$ serotypes; $4$ weeks after PPSV$23$, he had protective titers to $5$ of $23$ serotypes; at $6$ months, titers waned to protective levels for $2$ of $23$ serotypes.\n\nTwo separate measurements $3$ months apart show serum immunoglobulin A (IgA) below the lower limit of detection ($<7$ mg/dL).

            "solution": "This patient's presentation requires a synthesis of clinical history, immunoglobulin levels, functional antibody responses, and B-cell phenotyping to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.\n\n1.  **Clinical Picture and Immunoglobulin Levels**: The history of recurrent, severe sinopulmonary infections (pneumonia) is a cardinal sign of antibody deficiency. While the undetectable IgA ($<7$ mg/dL) could suggest selective IgA deficiency, the concurrent and markedly low serum IgG ($380$ mg/dL, reference $700$–$1500$ mg/dL) points towards a more severe defect. Crucially, the documented decline in IgG from $650$ mg/dL to $380$ mg/dL over one year indicates a progressive, not static, disorder.\n\n2.  **Functional Antibody Deficiency**: The patient shows a profoundly poor and non-durable response to the PPSV$23$ polysaccharide vaccine. This failure to mount and maintain a specific antibody response is a key functional defect.\n\n3.  **Cellular Defect**: While the total number of B cells is normal (ruling out X-linked agammaglobulinemia), the severe reduction in class-switched memory B cells indicates a block in terminal B-cell differentiation. This cellular defect explains the inability to maintain IgG levels and mount effective vaccine responses.\n\n**Conclusion and Management**: The combination of age ($>4$ years), marked hypogammaglobulinemia (low IgG and IgA), poor specific antibody function, and a characteristic B-cell phenotype confirms the diagnosis of Common Variable Immunodeficiency (CVID). The progressive nature of the hypogammaglobulinemia suggests an \"evolving CVID.\" Given the severe, recurrent infections, the standard of care and immediate management is to initiate immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IVIG or SCIG).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Selective immunoglobulin A deficiency; anticipate normal vaccine responses; avoid blood transfusions containing IgA; immunoglobulin replacement is not indicated**\n-   This option is incorrect. The diagnosis of selective IgA deficiency is incomplete, as it ignores the profound hypogammaglobulinemia (low IgG) and the documented poor vaccine response. The statement that vaccine responses are normal is directly contradicted by the data. The conclusion that immunoglobulin replacement is not indicated is dangerous and incorrect for a patient with severe hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent pneumonia.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. **Evolving common variable immunodeficiency; initiate immunoglobulin replacement therapy now**\n-   This option is correct. The diagnosis accurately synthesizes all the patient's data: low IgG and IgA, poor vaccine response, declining IgG levels over time, and a characteristic defect in switched memory B cells, all fitting the diagnosis of CVID in an $8$-year old. The management plan, initiating immunoglobulin replacement therapy, is the standard of care for a patient with this diagnosis and clinical history of severe infections.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. **Specific antibody deficiency; revaccinate with conjugate pneumococcal vaccine and recheck titers; immunoglobulin replacement is not indicated**\n-   This option is incorrect. While the patient has a specific antibody deficiency, this is a feature of his CVID, not the primary diagnosis. The term \"Specific Antibody Deficiency\" is typically reserved for patients with normal immunoglobulin levels. Furthermore, with a documented history of severe infections and a very low IgG level, delaying definitive treatment (immunoglobulin replacement) to perform further diagnostic vaccination is not appropriate. The statement that immunoglobulin replacement is not indicated is incorrect.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. **Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy; reassurance and defer live vaccines**\n-   This option is incorrect. Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) is a condition of early childhood that resolves, typically by age $4$. This patient is $8$ years old and has worsening, not resolving, hypogammaglobulinemia. \"Reassurance\" is grossly inappropriate management for this severe immunodeficiency.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. **X-linked agammaglobulinemia; confirm with Bruton tyrosine kinase gene testing and begin immunoglobulin replacement therapy**\n-   This option is incorrect. The diagnosis of X-linked agammaglobulinemia is ruled out by the finding of a normal percentage of $\\text{CD19}^+$ B cells in the blood. XLA is characterized by a near-complete absence of B cells due to a block in their early development.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
