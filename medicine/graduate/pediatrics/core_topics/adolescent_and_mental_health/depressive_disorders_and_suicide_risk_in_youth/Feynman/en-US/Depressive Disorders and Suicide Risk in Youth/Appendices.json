            "introduction": "A cornerstone of evidence-based practice is the ability to translate clinical trial data into meaningful metrics for decision-making. The Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is one such powerful tool, converting abstract risk reductions into a tangible number that represents the clinical effort required to achieve one additional positive outcome. This practice problem  challenges you to derive the NNT from first principles, using response rates from a hypothetical adolescent depression trial, thereby strengthening your ability to critically evaluate and compare treatment efficacies.",

            "problem": "A multisite randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adolescents with major depressive disorder (MDD) compares a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to placebo over $12$ weeks. The primary endpoint is symptomatic response, operationalized as a clinically meaningful reduction on a validated depression scale by week $12$. The observed probability of response under the SSRI is $0.55$, and under placebo is $0.40$. Assume the estimates are stable (e.g., sufficiently large sample and no meaningful loss to follow-up) and that the $12$-week time horizon is the reference period for clinical decision making.\n\nUsing only foundational definitions of event risk and the concept of the number needed to treat as the expected number of patients who must receive the SSRI, instead of placebo, over the $12$-week horizon to produce one additional responder attributable to the medication, compute the number needed to treat for response. Report the result as a unitless quantity, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nYour calculation should be grounded in first principles, beginning from risk under treatment and risk under control, and should not rely on any pre-memorized shortcut formulas. You may assume that risks are interpretable as probabilities and that linearity of expectation applies for counting expected additional responders across treated individuals. Provide the numeric value only; any clinical interpretation regarding pediatric depressive disorders and suicide risk monitoring is not required in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "Begin with core definitions relevant to binary outcomes in randomized controlled trials. Let $R_{T}$ denote the risk (probability) of response under the active treatment and $R_{C}$ denote the risk (probability) of response under control (placebo) over the specified time horizon. By the problem statement, $R_{T} = 0.55$ and $R_{C} = 0.40$, where each numerical value is a probability over $12$ weeks.\n\nA fundamental quantity for treatment effect on a probability scale is the absolute risk difference (also called the risk difference), defined as\n$$\n\\Delta R \\equiv R_{T} - R_{C}.\n$$\nThis risk difference represents, for a single patient, the increase in the probability of response attributable to receiving the active treatment rather than placebo, over the specified $12$-week horizon.\n\nTo connect this to the number needed to treat (NNT), consider treating $n$ adolescents with the SSRI instead of placebo. The expected number of additional responders attributable to treatment, when $n$ patients are treated rather than receiving placebo, is\n$$\n\\text{Expected additional responders} = n (R_{T} - R_{C}) = n \\Delta R.\n$$\nBy the conceptual definition of the number needed to treat, the NNT is the number $n$ such that the expected number of additional responders equals $1$:\n$$\nn \\Delta R = 1.\n$$\nSolving for $n$ yields the formula for NNT:\n$$\n\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta R}.\n$$\nNow compute $\\Delta R$ from the observed risks:\n$$\n\\Delta R = R_{T} - R_{C} = 0.55 - 0.40 = 0.15.\n$$\nSubstitute into the expression for NNT:\n$$\n\\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.15} = \\frac{100}{15} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.\\overline{6}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures, this is\n$$\n6.667.\n$$\n\nInterpretation in words (not required in the final numeric answer): An NNT of approximately $6.667$ over $12$ weeks means that, on average, treating about $6.667$ adolescents with the SSRI rather than placebo would yield one additional responder attributable to the medication over that time horizon. In clinical practice, it is common to report an integer by rounding up to the next whole person (i.e., $7$), but the problem requests rounding to four significant figures, hence $6.667$. For pediatric decision making regarding depressive disorders and suicide risk, NNT should be considered alongside potential harms (for example, the number needed to harm related to treatment-emergent suicidality) and within the context of vigilant monitoring.",

            "introduction": "A diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is only the first step; characterizing the specific features of an individual's depressive episode is critical for accurate risk stratification and treatment planning. The DSM-5-TR offers specifiers that delineate important subtypes of depression, such as those with melancholic or anxious features.

            "problem": "A $16$-year-old with no prior psychiatric history presents after $6$ weeks of nearly daily depressed mood and markedly diminished interest in activities. Over the past $2$ weeks, she reports that even positive events do not lift her mood and that she “cannot feel pleasure.” Her mother notes she now awakens at approximately $04{:}30$, about $2$ hours earlier than her usual time, and appears slowed and quiet at breakfast. Appetite is reduced; growth chart review shows a $5\\%$ unintentional weight loss over $6$ weeks. She endorses excessive guilt and impaired concentration. On direct inquiry using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), she reports passive thoughts of death and intermittent thoughts of “overdosing on pills,” but denies intent or a specific plan. She has never attempted suicide. She denies hallucinations and delusions. She denies any period of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, flight of ideas, or increased risky behavior. She also reports feeling “keyed up” most days, difficulty concentrating because of worry about school performance, a fear that “something terrible” might happen to family members, and occasional feelings that she “might lose control” when anxious. There is no substance use. Family has removed access to medications and firearms. Patient Health Questionnaire-$9$ (PHQ-$9$) score is $19$.\n\nStarting from the core Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-$5$-TR) definitions for a major depressive episode and DSM-$5$-TR specifiers, and from well-established pediatric risk management principles and evidence-based treatments for adolescent depression, determine which DSM-$5$-TR specifiers are most appropriate and how they change near-term suicide risk stratification and treatment planning for this patient. Which option best captures both the correct application of specifiers and the consequent risk and treatment implications?\n\nA. Apply “with melancholic features” and “with anxious distress.” Near-term suicide risk is elevated relative to non-anxious, non-melancholic depression due to the combination of severe biological features and anxiety/agitation; institute an outpatient plan with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A), safety planning, lethal means restriction verification, and at least weekly monitoring after initiation. Consider a higher level of care if intent or plan emerges.\n\nB. Apply “with atypical features.” Near-term suicide risk is low because mood is reactive; begin psychotherapy alone without pharmacotherapy and routine monthly follow-up.\n\nC. Apply “with mixed features.” Near-term suicide risk is very high due to subthreshold mania; avoid antidepressants and start a mood stabilizer, with immediate inpatient hospitalization.\n\nD. Apply “with melancholic features” only; anxiety is secondary to depression and does not warrant an additional specifier. Near-term suicide risk is not materially changed by anxiety; prefer bupropion monotherapy due to weight loss, without psychotherapy or enhanced monitoring.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a clinical vignette that is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides sufficient information to proceed with a diagnosis and treatment plan based on established principles of clinical psychiatry. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**1. Diagnosis and Severity**\n\nThe patient is a $16$-year-old female presenting with symptoms that meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-$5$-TR) criteria for a Major Depressive Episode (MDE). An MDE requires at least five of nine specific symptoms to be present during the same $2$-week period, representing a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms must be either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.\n\nThe patient exhibits the following $8$ of $9$ criteria:\n1.  Depressed mood nearly every day for $6$ weeks.\n2.  Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities (anhedonia).\n3.  Significant unintentional weight loss ($5\\%$) and decreased appetite.\n4.  Insomnia (specifically, early morning awakening, about $2$ hours earlier than usual).\n5.  Psychomotor retardation (observed to be \"slowed\").\n6.  Feelings of excessive guilt.\n7.  Diminished ability to think or concentrate.\n8.  Recurrent thoughts of death, including passive ideation and active ideation with method but without specific plan or intent.\n\nThe duration of the episode ($6$ weeks) and the severity, as indicated by a Patient Health Questionnaire-$9$ (PHQ-$9$) score of $19$ (moderately severe depression), clearly establish the diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder, single episode, moderately severe.\n\n**2. Application of DSM-$5$-TR Specifiers**\n\n*   **\"With Melancholic Features\"**: This specifier requires one of the following gateway criteria: (A) a loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities, or (B) a lack of reactivity to usually pleasurable stimuli. The patient exhibits both (\"markedly diminished interest,\" \"even positive events do not lift her mood\"). Additionally, at least three of the following six symptoms are required:\n    1.  Distinct quality of depressed mood. (Not explicitly stated but consistent with the presentation).\n    2.  Depression that is regularly worse in the morning. (Not explicitly stated).\n    3.  **Early-morning awakening** (at least $2$ hours before usual time). This is met.\n    4.  **Marked psychomotor retardation**. This is met (\"slowed\").\n    5.  **Significant anorexia or weight loss**. This is met ($5\\%$ weight loss).\n    6.  **Excessive or inappropriate guilt**. This is met.\n    Since at least four criteria are met (3, 4, 5, 6), the specifier \"with melancholic features\" is appropriate.\n\n*   **\"With Anxious Distress\"**: This specifier requires at least two of the following five symptoms to be present most days during the MDE:\n    1.  **Feeling keyed up or tense**. This is met (\"keyed up' most days\").\n    2.  Feeling unusually restless. (Not stated).\n    3.  **Difficulty concentrating because of worry**. This is met.\n    4.  **A fear that something awful might happen**. This is met.\n    5.  **A feeling that the individual might lose control**. This is met.\n    Since four of the five criteria are met, the specifier \"with anxious distress\" is appropriate (at a \"moderate-severe\" level of severity).\n\n*   **\"With Atypical Features\"**: The essential criterion for this specifier is mood reactivity, meaning the mood brightens in response to positive events. The patient explicitly \"denies mood reactivity,\" making this specifier incorrect.\n\n*   **\"With Mixed Features\"**: This specifier requires at least three manic/hypomanic symptoms. The patient explicitly denies a history of abnormally elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, or flight of ideas. Therefore, this specifier is incorrect.\n\n**3. Suicide Risk Stratification and Treatment Planning**\n\n*   **Suicide Risk**: The patient's suicide risk is elevated. She endorses active suicidal ideation (\"overdosing on pills\") on the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), which is a significant risk factor, even without a specific plan or intent. The presence of both \"melancholic features\" (associated with severe depression and completed suicide) and \"anxious distress\" (a specifier specifically noted in DSM-$5$-TR to increase suicide risk) further elevates the near-term risk. The family's proactive lethal means restriction is a critical protective factor.\n\n*   **Treatment Plan**: For an adolescent with moderately severe major depression, especially with features indicating high severity (melancholic) and risk (anxious distress, suicidal ideation), the evidence-based standard of care is combination treatment.\n    *   **Pharmacotherapy**: A Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI), such as fluoxetine or escitalopram, is a first-line agent.\n    *   **Psychotherapy**: Evidence-based psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A), is essential.\n    *   **Level of Care**: An intensive outpatient plan is appropriate given the absence of suicidal intent or plan and the presence of family support and means restriction. This plan must include:\n        *   **Safety Planning**: A collaborative plan to manage suicidal urges.\n        *   **Lethal Means Restriction**: Verification and reinforcement of the family's actions.\n        *   **Frequent Monitoring**: At least weekly follow-up appointments, especially upon initiation of an SSRI, to monitor for side effects and any increase in suicidality (per the FDA black box warning).\n        *   **Contingency Planning**: A clear plan to escalate to a higher level of care (e.g., intensive outpatient program, partial hospitalization, or inpatient hospitalization) if risk escalates (e.g., emergence of intent or a plan).\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Apply “with melancholic features” and “with anxious distress.” Near-term suicide risk is elevated relative to non-anxious, non-melancholic depression due to the combination of severe biological features and anxiety/agitation; institute an outpatient plan with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) or Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Adolescents (IPT-A), safety planning, lethal means restriction verification, and at least weekly monitoring after initiation. Consider a higher level of care if intent or plan emerges.**\n    - **Analysis**: This option correctly identifies both appropriate specifiers (\"melancholic features\" and \"anxious distress\"). It accurately assesses the suicide risk as elevated based on these factors. The proposed treatment plan is comprehensive, evidence-based, and adheres to the standard of care for this clinical presentation, including the choice of medication, psychotherapy, and crucial safety/monitoring components.\n    - **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Apply “with atypical features.” Near-term suicide risk is low because mood is reactive; begin psychotherapy alone without pharmacotherapy and routine monthly follow-up.**\n    - **Analysis**: This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. The \"atypical features\" specifier is contradicted by the patient's lack of mood reactivity. The suicide risk is not low. The recommended treatment plan (psychotherapy alone with monthly follow-up) is insufficient for the severity of illness and level of risk, falling below the standard of care.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Apply “with mixed features.” Near-term suicide risk is very high due to subthreshold mania; avoid antidepressants and start a mood stabilizer, with immediate inpatient hospitalization.**\n    - **Analysis**: This option incorrectly applies the \"mixed features\" specifier, as the patient denies the requisite manic/hypomanic symptoms. The resulting treatment plan (mood stabilizer, avoidance of antidepressants) is inappropriate for unipolar depression. While the risk is elevated, immediate hospitalization is not the only viable option given the lack of intent/plan.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Apply “with melancholic features” only; anxiety is secondary to depression and does not warrant an additional specifier. Near-term suicide risk is not materially changed by anxiety; prefer bupropion monotherapy due to weight loss, without psychotherapy or enhanced monitoring.**\n    - **Analysis**: This option incorrectly dismisses the \"anxious distress\" specifier, for which the patient clearly meets the criteria. It makes a factually incorrect statement that anxiety does not materially change suicide risk. The proposed treatment plan is dangerously inadequate: bupropion is not a standard first-line choice for anxious depression, and the omission of psychotherapy and enhanced monitoring is a gross deviation from the standard of care for a suicidal adolescent.\n    - **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

To balance efficacy with tolerability and close monitoring, you plan an initial daily dose of $10$ mg. Assume the pharmacokinetics of the serotonergic effect can be approximated by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination and an effective half-life of $t_{1/2} = 4$ days, and that daily oral dosing for a long half-life approximates a near-constant input over time for the purposes of estimating approach to steady state.\n\nInstitutional policy to minimize early adverse effects requires two conditions before increasing the dose from $10$ mg to $20$ mg daily in the first month:\n- The exposure at the current dose must reach at least $0.90$ of steady-state.\n- The post-increase daily dose must not exceed $0.6$ mg/kg.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and properties of first-order kinetics (for example, the definition of half-life and the qualitative behavior of exponential approach to steady state), derive the earliest time $t_{\\min}$ (in days since initiation) at which it is scientifically justified to increase the dose from $10$ mg to $20$ mg while meeting both conditions.
