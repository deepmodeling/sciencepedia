The symptoms (purpura, arthralgia, antecedent infection), laboratory findings (normal platelets, hematuria), and biopsy results (leukocytoclastic vasculitis) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The problem is based on established medical facts and principles.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a comprehensive set of clinical and laboratory data and asks for the application of a specific, internationally recognized classification system (EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria). A unique answer can be derived by correct application of these criteria.\n*   **Objective**: The language is objective and clinical, presenting data without bias or subjective interpretation.\n*   **Completeness**: The problem provides sufficient information to apply the specified classification criteria.\n*   **Consistency**: There are no internal contradictions in the provided data.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-structured question regarding the application of clinical classification criteria in medicine. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to determine if the patient meets the classification criteria for IgA vasculitis (IgAV) according to the $2010$ EULAR/PRINTO/PRES consensus criteria, and to select the best justification. The core principles provided are the pathophysiology of small-vessel vasculitis and the specific classification schema.\n\nThe EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria for IgA vasculitis are as follows:\n\n**Mandatory Criterion:**\n*   Palpable purpura (non-thrombocytopenic, i.e., in the absence of thrombocytopenia), typically with lower limb predominance.\n\n**Plus at least one of the following four criteria:**\n1.  Diffuse abdominal pain.\n2.  Biopsy showing predominant IgA deposition (typically leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposits).\n3.  Arthritis or arthralgia.\n4.  Renal involvement (defined as any hematuria [e.g., $>5$ RBCs/HPF] and/or proteinuria [e.g., $>0.3\\,\\mathrm{g/24h}$]).\n\nLet us apply these criteria to the patient's data:\n\n1.  **Mandatory Criterion**: The patient presents with \"palpable, non-blanching purpura over the posterior calves and buttocks\". This meets the description of palpable purpura with lower limb predominance. The platelet count is $265 \\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$, which is well within the normal range, confirming the purpura is non-thrombocytopenic. **The mandatory criterion is met.**\n\n2.  **Supporting Criteria**: We must check for at least one of the four additional features.\n    *   **Criterion 1 (Abdominal pain)**: The patient \"denies abdominal pain\". This criterion is **not met**.\n    *   **Criterion 2 (Biopsy)**: A punch biopsy showed \"leukocytoclastic small-vessel vasculitis\". However, the direct immunofluorescence (DIF) to check for predominant IgA deposition is \"pending\". Therefore, this criterion is **not yet confirmed**. Note that classification can often be made without a biopsy if other criteria are sufficient.\n    *   **Criterion 3 (Arthritis/Arthralgia)**: The patient reports \"bilateral ankle and knee arthralgia\". This criterion is **met**.\n    *   **Criterion 4 (Renal involvement)**: Urinalysis shows \"$35$ red blood cells (RBCs) per high-power field (HPF)\" and \"proteinuria of $0.6\\,\\mathrm{g/day}$\". Both hematuria and proteinuria are present and exceed the typical thresholds for significance. This criterion is **met**.\n\n**Conclusion on Classification**: The patient fulfills the mandatory criterion (non-thrombocytopenic palpable purpura) and two of the four supporting criteria (arthralgia and renal involvement). Since only one supporting criterion is required, the patient can be formally classified as having IgA vasculitis under the EULAR/PRINTO/PRES framework.\n\n**Addressing the Age**: The problem states the patient is $34$ years old and explicitly asks whether the \"pediatric derived\" schema is applicable. Although the EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria were developed in a pediatric population, they have been validated for and are now widely used in the classification of IgA vasculitis in adults. The criteria themselves do not include an age restriction. Therefore, the patient's age of $34$ does not preclude the use of this classification system.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow we evaluate each statement based on the above derivation.\n\n**A. Classification is justified because palpable purpura with lower limb predominance is mandatory and the patient has additional systemic criteria (arthralgia and renal involvement), and the schema does not impose an age restriction.**\nThis statement correctly asserts that classification is justified. It correctly identifies that the patient has the necessary features: palpable purpura and additional criteria (arthralgia and renal involvement). Critically, it correctly states that the schema does not have an age restriction, addressing the central ambiguity posed in the problem. The mandatory criterion is palpable purpura; the lower limb predominance is a typical feature mentioned in the formal criteria and is present in this patient. This statement provides a complete and accurate justification.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Classification is not justified because the schema was derived in pediatrics and mandates age $\\leq 18$ years for applicability.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. While the schema was developed in collaboration with pediatric societies, it does not mandate an age limit of $\\leq 18$ years. It is regularly applied to adult patients.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Classification is not justified because abdominal pain is mandatory; arthralgia and hematuria alone are insufficient.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Abdominal pain is one of four optional criteria, not a mandatory one. The only mandatory criterion is palpable purpura. The presence of arthralgia or hematuria (renal involvement) is each individually sufficient to meet the requirements alongside purpura.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Classification is not justified without a renal biopsy demonstrating predominant IgA deposition; hematuria and proteinuria cannot count as renal involvement.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The EULAR/PRINTO/PRES criteria specifically define \"renal involvement\" as the presence of hematuria and/or proteinuria. A renal biopsy is not required for classification if other criteria are met. Demonstration of IgA deposition on biopsy is a separate, alternative criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Classification is not justified because thrombocytopenia is required to attribute purpura to vasculitis; a normal platelet count contradicts vasculitic purpura.**\nThis statement is the opposite of the truth. Vasculitic purpura is characteristically *non*-thrombocytopenic, as it results from inflammation-induced leakage of RBCs from vessels, not a failure of primary hemostasis due to low platelets. The criteria for IgA vasculitis explicitly require the absence of thrombocytopenia. A normal platelet count is expected and helps to distinguish vasculitis from other causes of purpura, such as immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, statement A provides the only correct and comprehensive justification for classifying this patient with IgA vasculitis using the specified criteria.",

The solution will proceed from first principles.\n\nLet $D_r$ be the prescribed mass-specific dose rate, $m$ be the patient's body mass, and $D_{\\text{total}}$ be the total daily dose.\nThe given values are:\n- $D_r = 2 \\, \\text{mg/kg/day}$\n- $m = 25 \\, \\text{kg}$\n\nThe total daily dose is calculated by multiplying the mass-specific dose rate by the patient's body mass:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total}} = D_r \\times m\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nD_{\\text{total}} = \\left( 2 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\right) \\times (25 \\, \\text{kg}) = 50 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\nThe total daily dose is $50$ mg.\n\nNext, this calculated total daily dose must be compared with the specified maximum daily dose ceiling, $D_{\\text{max}}$.\n- $D_{\\text{total}} = 50 \\, \\text{mg/day}$\n- $D_{\\text{max}} = 60 \\, \\text{mg/day}$\n\nThe confirmation is a direct comparison:\n$$\n50 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}} \\le 60 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}\n$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the calculated daily dose respects the stated safety ceiling.\n\nThe problem specifies that the total daily dose is to be divided evenly into twice-daily administrations. Let $n$ be the number of doses per day, where $n=2$. Let $D_{\\text{dose}}$ be the amount of prednisone per single dose.\n$$\nD_{\\text{dose}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{total}}}{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated total daily dose and the number of administrations:\n$$\nD_{\\text{dose}} = \\frac{50 \\, \\text{mg}}{2} = 25 \\, \\text{mg}\n$$\nThe resulting per-dose amount is $25$ mg. The problem requires this value to be rounded to two significant figures. The number $25$ is an integer with exactly two significant figures ($2$ and $5$), so no rounding is necessary. The per-dose amount is $25$ mg.\n\nFinally, the monitoring plan must be specified as per the problem statement.\n- Reassessment time point: $48$ hours post-initiation of therapy.\n- Clinical metric: Gastrointestinal pain level, assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), which ranges from $0$ (no pain) to $10$ (worst possible pain).\n\nIn summary:\n1. The per-dose amount is $25$ mg.\n2. The total daily dose of $50$ mg is safely below the $60$ mg ceiling.\n3. The monitoring plan consists of reassessment at $48$ hours using the NRS for pain.",

He has had intermittent gross hematuria. On examination, he appears uncomfortable, the left testis is tender and slightly elevated compared to the right, and the cremasteric reflex on the left is diminished. He is afebrile, with normal vital signs. There is no scrotal erythema or fluctuance. A facility-based Color Doppler Ultrasonography (CDUS) service is available with a technologist on site; anticipated time to bedside scanning is $20$ minutes. \n\nYou are asked to design and select an evidence-based algorithm to evaluate scrotal pain in Henoch-Schönlein purpura (Immunoglobulin A vasculitis) that prioritizes immediate Color Doppler Ultrasonography to differentiate testicular torsion from vasculitic orchitis, while minimizing ischemic time in potentially torsed testes. Your algorithm must be justified from first principles. The relevant first principles and well-tested facts include:\n\n- Testicular torsion causes arterial inflow compromise with time-dependent ischemia; salvage rates are highest when detorsion occurs within approximately $6$ hours, with steep decline by $12$ hours as irreversible injury accumulates due to hypoxia, acidosis, and free radical injury.\n- Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (Immunoglobulin A vasculitis) is a leukocytoclastic small-vessel vasculitis that can involve scrotal structures, causing pain, edema, and orchitis via immune complex deposition and complement activation; this is not an ischemic process at its core, and urgent surgery is not therapeutic.\n- Color Doppler Ultrasonography measures blood flow and is widely accepted to have sensitivity $>90\\%$ and specificity $>95\\%$ for detecting absent or reduced intratesticular perfusion in testicular torsion when performed promptly by experienced personnel.\n- In time-critical diagnoses, decision thresholds depend on pretest probability; high pretest probability mandates immediate definitive management without delaying for tests that would not change management within the ischemic window, whereas intermediate pretest probability supports rapid testing if it does not materially delay definitive care.\n\nWhich of the following stepwise algorithms most appropriately implements these principles in a pediatric patient with Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (Immunoglobulin A vasculitis) presenting with acute scrotal pain, correctly prioritizing immediate Color Doppler Ultrasonography but preserving time-sensitive management of suspected torsion?\n\nA.

Obtain comprehensive laboratory studies first (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, urinalysis, complement levels) to differentiate infection from vasculitis and torsion; if laboratory studies suggest vasculitis (for example, hematuria and proteinuria), start corticosteroids; reserve Color Doppler Ultrasonography for cases without laboratory evidence of vasculitis.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a valid, albeit complex, clinical scenario that requires careful application of established medical principles to resolve a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The core challenge is differentiating testicular torsion, a time-critical surgical emergency, from vasculitic orchitis, a medical condition, in a patient with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP), also known as Immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV).\n\n### Validation of the Problem Statement\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Patient Data:** A $10$-year-old boy.\n*   **Presentation:** $2$ hours of sudden-onset left scrotal pain and swelling.\n*   **Past Medical History:** Diagnosed $1$ week prior with HSP (IgAV) based on palpable purpura, colicky abdominal pain, and arthralgia.

Testicular torsion is a time-sensitive ischemic emergency with optimal salvage within $6$ hours, with viability declining steeply by $12$ hours.\n    2.  HSP (IgAV) orchitis is an inflammatory, non-ischemic condition not treated with urgent surgery.\n    3.  CDUS has high diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity $>90\\%$, specificity $>95\\%$) for testicular torsion.\n    4.  Management is guided by pretest probability: high probability may warrant immediate surgery without delay for imaging, while intermediate probability supports rapid imaging if it does not materially delay definitive care.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n\n*   **Scientific Groundedness:** The clinical presentation is classic for testicular torsion (sudden pain, high-riding testis, absent cremasteric reflex). The confounding history of HSP (IgAV) is a known cause of acute scrotum that can mimic torsion, creating a real-world diagnostic challenge. The provided principles regarding the pathophysiology of torsion, the nature of vasculitic orchitis, the utility of CDUS, and the logic of pretest probability are all firmly rooted in established medical and surgical practice.\n*   **Well-Posed and Complete:** The problem is structured to have a single best answer derived from the explicit principles. All necessary information is provided: patient signs and symptoms, relevant history, a clear time course ($2$ hours of symptoms), resource availability ($20$ minutes to CDUS), and the fundamental principles to be used for decision-making.\n*   **Objectivity:** The description is clinical and factual, devoid of subjective or biased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The scenario is realistic and the guiding principles are correct, allowing for a rigorous, logical derivation of the optimal management algorithm.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Algorithm from First Principles\n\nThe primary objective is to prevent testicular loss. Principle $1$ establishes a critical ischemic window of approximately $6$ hours. With symptoms present for $2$ hours, roughly $4$ hours remain for diagnosis and intervention. This timeline dictates that any action must be rapid and efficient.\n\nThe patient's physical exam findings are highly suggestive of testicular torsion. In a patient without HSP (IgAV), these findings would confer a high pretest probability, and according to Principle $4$, would often justify immediate surgical exploration without imaging to minimize ischemic time.\n\nHowever, the diagnosis of HSP (IgAV) introduces a significant confounder. HSP (IgAV) is known to cause testicular inflammation (orchitis) that can precisely mimic the signs of torsion (Principle $2$). This makes the diagnosis of torsion less certain than it would otherwise be; the pretest probability, while still high, is more accurately described as intermediate-to-high.\n\nThis is where Principles $3$ and $4$ become critical. Principle $4$ states that for intermediate pretest probability, rapid testing is supported if it does not \"materially delay definitive care.\" Principle $3$ establishes CDUS as a highly accurate test for this purpose. The problem specifies that CDUS can be obtained at the bedside in $20$ minutes. This $20$-minute interval is a very small fraction of the remaining $4$-hour therapeutic window and thus does not constitute a material delay.\n\nTherefore, the optimal algorithm for this specific patient must involve immediate risk assessment followed by the use of rapid CDUS to definitively differentiate between torsion (requiring surgery) and orchitis (requiring medical management). The algorithm must also include a failsafe: if imaging is delayed or inconclusive, or if clinical suspicion remains unacceptably high, the default action must be surgical exploration to err on the side of testicular salvage. In parallel with arranging imaging, the pediatric urology service should be notified, as their involvement will be required emergently if torsion is confirmed or strongly suspected.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Empirically attribute scrotal pain to vasculitic orchitis because Henoch-Schönlein Purpura (Immunoglobulin A vasculitis) is present; administer corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; obtain Color Doppler Ultrasonography only if pain persists beyond $24$ hours.**\nThis option incorrectly prioritizes the medical diagnosis over the surgical emergency. It ignores the significant physical exam findings suspicious for torsion. Waiting $24$ hours, as per Principle $1$, would result in guaranteed non-viability of a torsed testis. This approach is dangerous.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Perform immediate risk stratification using history and physical examination; if pretest probability for torsion is high (for example, sudden severe unilateral pain, high-riding testis, nausea/vomiting, markedly absent cremasteric reflex), notify pediatric urology and proceed directly to emergent surgical exploration without delaying for imaging; if pretest probability is intermediate or low, obtain immediate bedside Color Doppler Ultrasonography within $30$ minutes to assess perfusion; if Color Doppler Ultrasonography shows absent or markedly reduced flow, proceed emergently to exploration; if Color Doppler Ultrasonography shows preserved or increased flow consistent with vasculitic orchitis, initiate supportive care and consider corticosteroids for vasculitis; at any point, if imaging would delay care beyond a safe ischemic window or is inconclusive with persistent high suspicion, prioritize exploration.**\nThis algorithm is comprehensive and correctly applies all the provided principles. It begins with risk stratification. It appropriately describes two paths based on pretest probability (Principle $4$). For this patient, whose signs of torsion are strong but confounded by HSP, the \"intermediate\" (or intermediate-to-high) probability pathway leading to immediate CDUS is the most logical interpretation. The specified timeframe for CDUS ($30$ minutes) is consistent with the problem's stated availability ($20$ minutes) and respects the ischemic window. The actions based on CDUS findings (absent flow $\\rightarrow$ surgery; present flow $\\rightarrow$ medical care) are correct. Crucially, it includes the essential safety net of prioritizing exploration if imaging is delayed or inconclusive. This option perfectly aligns with the derived optimal algorithm.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Obtain comprehensive laboratory studies first (complete blood count, C-reactive protein, urinalysis, complement levels) to differentiate infection from vasculitis and torsion; if laboratory studies suggest vasculitis (for example, hematuria and proteinuria), start corticosteroids; reserve Color Doppler Ultrasonography for cases without laboratory evidence of vasculitis.**\nThis option introduces a critical and unnecessary delay. Laboratory tests are not specific for torsion and typically require $1-2$ hours for results, consuming a large portion of the salvage window (violating Principle $1$). The patient's diagnosis of HSP (IgAV) is already known, and associated findings like hematuria are expected; their presence does not rule out a concurrent torsion. The definitive diagnostic test is one that assesses perfusion (CDUS), not systemic inflammation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Always obtain Color Doppler Ultrasonography before any specialist notification; wait for radiology interpretation even if the time to scan is $60$–$90$ minutes; if the scan confirms torsion, then call pediatric urology; if the scan shows flow, discharge with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.**\nThis option is flawed in multiple ways. First, specialist notification should occur in parallel with, not after, diagnostic workup to save time. Second, accepting a $60$–$90$ minute delay for imaging is contrary to the principle of minimizing ischemic time, especially when quicker alternatives (direct exploration) exist. Third, discharging a patient with active, painful HSP (IgAV) orchitis and gross hematuria is inappropriate and unsafe medical management.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Attempt manual detorsion for all patients with acute scrotal pain regardless of features; if pain improves, cancel any imaging; if pain does not improve, observe for $6$ hours and then obtain Color Doppler Ultrasonography to rule out torsion.**\nThis option is reckless. Manual detorsion is a temporizing measure for suspected torsion but is not definitive; subsequent surgical exploration is still required for orchiopexy. Cancelling imaging/surgery after improvement is dangerous due to risk of re-torsion. The most egregious error is observing for $6$ hours before imaging if the attempt fails. This guarantees that the optimal window for salvage will have closed, directly and completely violating Principle $1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
