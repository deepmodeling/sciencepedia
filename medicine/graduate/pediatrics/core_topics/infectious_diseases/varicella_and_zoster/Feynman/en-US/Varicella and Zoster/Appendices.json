A laboratory result, even from a highly accurate test, does not provide a definitive answer in isolation; its predictive power is critically dependent on the clinical context. This exercise guides you through the application of Bayes' theorem to calculate the positive predictive value (PPV) of a VZV PCR test, a fundamental skill for translating a test result into a meaningful posterior probability of disease and making evidence-based clinical decisions .",

            "problem": "A tertiary pediatric infectious diseases clinic evaluates a cohort of children presenting with acute vesicular eruptions consistent with primary varicella (Varicella-Zoster Virus, VZV). Based on epidemiologic surveillance and clinical criteria for this specific cohort, the pretest probability of true VZV infection is estimated to be $30\\%$. The clinic uses a validated real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for VZV on lesion swabs.

The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, pretest probability, and posterior probability (Positive Predictive Value) are standard, well-defined metrics in epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. The clinical context is realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters—prior probability, sensitivity, and specificity—to calculate the desired quantity. It asks for a single, unique numerical value.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous terminology.

It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem in applied probability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of a patient having a true VZV infection given a positive test result. This quantity is known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV). We will derive this from first principles using Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n-   $D$: The event that a child has a true VZV infection (the disease is present).\n-   $D^c$: The event that a child does not have a true VZV infection (the disease is absent).\n-   $T$: The event that the PCR test result is positive.\n-   $T^c$: The event that the PCR test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pretest probability, or prior probability, of having the disease is $P(D) = 30\\% = 0.30$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $P(T|D) = 95\\% = 0.95$.\n3.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $P(T^c|D^c) = 99\\% = 0.99$.\n\nFrom these given probabilities, we can deduce two additional probabilities required for the calculation:\n-   The prior probability of not having the disease is the complement of having it: $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n-   The probability of a positive test result given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate) is the complement of the specificity: $P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\n\nWe are asked to find the posterior probability $P(D|T)$. According to Bayes' theorem, this is given by:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. It can be calculated by applying the law of total probability, which marginalizes over the state of the disease (present or absent):\n$$\nP(T) = P(T \\cap D) + P(T \\cap D^c)\n$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$, we can write:\n$$\nP(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)\n$$\nThe term $P(T|D)P(D)$ is the probability of a true positive, and the term $P(T|D^c)P(D^c)$ is the probability of a false positive.\n\nSubstituting this expanded form of $P(T)$ back into Bayes' theorem, we obtain the complete formula for the Positive Predictive Value:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D)P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|D^c)P(D^c)}\n$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values into this derived expression.\n-   $P(D) = 0.30$\n-   $P(D^c) = 0.70$\n-   $P(T|D) = 0.95$\n-   $P(T|D^c) = 0.01$\n\nThe numerator is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive (true positives):\n$$\nP(T|D)P(D) = (0.95) \\times (0.30) = 0.285\n$$\nThe denominator is the total probability of testing positive, which is the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$\nP(T) = (0.95) \\times (0.30) + (0.01) \\times (0.70)\n$$\n$$\nP(T) = 0.285 + 0.007 = 0.292\n$$\nThe posterior probability $P(D|T)$ is the ratio of these values:\n$$\nP(D|T) = \\frac{0.285}{0.292}\n$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$\nP(D|T) \\approx 0.976027397...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9, 7, 6, 0$. The fifth digit is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\nP(D|T) \\approx 0.9760\n$$\nThus, for a child selected from this cohort, a positive PCR test result increases the probability of a true VZV infection from a prior of $30\\%$ to a posterior probability of approximately $97.60\\%$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of data for a standard pharmaceutical calculation.\n\nThe objective is to determine the total mass of acyclovir administered over a specified course of treatment.

The clinical team considers post-exposure prophylaxis with Varicella Zoster Immune Globulin (VariZIG) to reduce the risk of severe disease. The hospital’s logistics impose three constraints on when administration can occur postpartum: nursing policy permits intramuscular injections no earlier than $2$ hours after birth, parental consent will be finalized at $4$ hours postpartum, and the pharmacy will have the product ready at exactly $6$ hours postpartum.

The premises are factually correct within the context of medical practice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A formal solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the determination of two quantities: the appropriate dose of VariZIG and the earliest feasible administration time.\n\n**Part 1: Determination of VariZIG Dose**\nThe dose of VariZIG is determined by the neonate's weight. The given birth weight is $w = 3.2$ kg. We must locate which weight band this value falls into from the provided dosing schedule.\nThe dosing bands are:\n- Band 1: $0$ kg to $10$ kg\n- Band 2: $10.1$ kg to $20$ kg\n- Band 3: $20.1$ kg to $30$ kg\n- Band 4: $30.1$ kg to $40$ kg\n- Band 5: greater than $40$ kg\n\nThe neonate's weight of $3.2$ kg satisfies the condition $0 \\le 3.2 \\le 10$. Therefore, the neonate falls into the first weight band. The prescribed dose for this band is $125$ International Units (IU).\nDose = $125$ IU.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Administration Time**\nFirst, we confirm that prophylaxis is indicated. The indication is for maternal varicella onset in the period from $5$ days before delivery to $2$ days after delivery. Maternal rash onset occurred $48$ hours, which is equivalent to $2$ days, prior to delivery. This time point is within the specified interval. Thus, VariZIG administration is clinically indicated.\n\nNext, we determine the earliest possible administration time by considering all logistical constraints. Let $t$ be the administration time in hours postpartum.\n- Constraint 1 (Nursing): The injection can only be given at or after $2$ hours postpartum. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 2$.\n- Constraint 2 (Consent): Parental consent is finalized at $4$ hours postpartum. Administration cannot precede this. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 4$.\n- Constraint 3 (Pharmacy): The product is available at $6$ hours postpartum. Administration cannot occur before the product is ready. This imposes the condition $t \\ge 6$.\n\nFor administration to be feasible, all three conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. We are seeking the earliest time, which is the minimum value of $t$ that satisfies all inequalities:\n$t \\ge 2$\n$t \\ge 4$\n$t \\ge 6$\n\nThe solution to this system of inequalities is $t \\ge \\max(2, 4, 6)$.\nCalculating the maximum: $\\max(2, 4, 6) = 6$.\nTherefore, the earliest logistically feasible time for administration is $t = 6$ hours postpartum.\n\nFinally, we must verify that this time complies with the overall guideline to administer \"as soon as possible within $10$ days ($240$ hours) of exposure.\" An administration time of $6$ hours postpartum is the soonest possible time given the constraints and is well within the $240$-hour maximum window.\n\nThe two required values are a dose of $125$ IU and an administration time of $6$ hours postpartum.",
