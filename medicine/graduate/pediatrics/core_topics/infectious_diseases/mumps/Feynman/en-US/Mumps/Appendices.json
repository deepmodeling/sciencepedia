            "problem": "A $6$-year-old child with confirmed mumps presents with fever and parotid tenderness. The child weighs $22.7$ kilograms and has no hepatic or renal impairment. Supportive care is planned using Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol), guided by pediatric weight-based dosing and dosing-interval constraints. Use the following widely accepted pediatric dosing facts and constraints as the foundational base:\n\n- Ibuprofen dose is $10$ mg/kg per dose, given every $6$–$8$ hours, with a maximum daily allowance of $40$ mg/kg/day. Common absolute daily caps in pediatric practice are at most $1.2 \\times 10^{3}$ mg/day.\n- Acetaminophen dose is $15$ mg/kg per dose, given every $4$–$6$ hours, with a maximum daily allowance of $75$ mg/kg/day. Common absolute daily caps in pediatric practice are at most $4.0 \\times 10^{3}$ mg/day.\n- The oral suspension formulations available are ibuprofen $100$ mg per $5$ mL and acetaminophen $160$ mg per $5$ mL.\n\nStarting from these facts and the definition of weight-based dosing, determine the following, ensuring that both the dosing-interval constraints and the maximum daily dosage constraints are satisfied over any $24$-hour period:\n\n1. The per-dose volumes for ibuprofen and acetaminophen, expressed in milliliters, computed from the weight-based per-dose amounts and the given formulation concentrations. Round each per-dose volume to three significant figures.\n2. The maximum integer number of ibuprofen doses and the maximum integer number of acetaminophen doses that can be administered in any $24$-hour period while satisfying both the dosing-interval constraints and the maximum daily dosage constraints.\n\nProvide your final answer as a row matrix containing, in order, the ibuprofen per-dose volume in milliliters, the acetaminophen per-dose volume in milliliters, the maximum number of ibuprofen doses in $24$ hours, and the maximum number of acetaminophen doses in $24$ hours. No units should appear inside your final matrix; volumes must be rounded to three significant figures as specified.",
            "solution": "The posed problem will first be subjected to a rigorous validation process to ascertain its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following data and constraints:\n- Child's weight, $M = 22.7$ kilograms.\n- **Ibuprofen Dosing:**\n  - Recommended dose: $D_{I, \\text{dose}} = 10$ mg/kg per dose.\n  - Dosing interval: $T_{I, \\text{int}} = 6$–$8$ hours.\n  - Maximum weight-based daily allowance: $D_{I, \\text{max, wt}} = 40$ mg/kg/day.\n  - Maximum absolute daily allowance: $D_{I, \\text{max, abs}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}$ mg/day.\n  - Formulation concentration: $C_{I, \\text{form}} = 100$ mg per $5$ mL.\n- **Acetaminophen Dosing:**\n  - Recommended dose: $D_{A, \\text{dose}} = 15$ mg/kg per dose.\n  - Dosing interval: $T_{A, \\text{int}} = 4$–$6$ hours.\n  - Maximum weight-based daily allowance: $D_{A, \\text{max, wt}} = 75$ mg/kg/day.\n  - Maximum absolute daily allowance: $D_{A, \\text{max, abs}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3}$ mg/day.\n  - Formulation concentration: $C_{A, \\text{form}} = 160$ mg per $5$ mL.\n- **Task:**\n  1.

Determine the maximum integer number of ibuprofen doses ($N_{I, \\text{max}}$) and acetaminophen doses ($N_{A, \\text{max}}$) in a $24$-hour period.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the established criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in standard pediatric pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The specified dosages, intervals, maximum daily limits, and oral suspension concentrations for ibuprofen and acetaminophen are consistent with accepted medical and pharmaceutical guidelines. The clinical scenario (supportive care for mumps) is appropriate.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. All necessary numerical values and constraints are provided to calculate the requested quantities.

The constraints for each drug are self-consistent and represent a realistic clinical scenario where multiple safety limits must be adhered to simultaneously. For instance, the maximum number of doses is constrained by both the minimum dosing interval and the maximum daily total dosage, which is a standard feature of therapeutic regimens.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a systematic calculation of dose volumes and the maximum number of doses permissible within a $24$-hour period, subject to several constraints. The analysis will be performed separately for ibuprofen and acetaminophen.\n\nLet $M = 22.7 \\, \\text{kg}$ be the child's mass. The duration of interest is $\\Delta t = 24 \\, \\text{hours}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the concentrations of the oral suspensions in a more convenient unit of mg/mL.\nFor ibuprofen:\n$$C_I = \\frac{100 \\, \\text{mg}}{5 \\, \\text{mL}} = 20 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\nFor acetaminophen:\n$$C_A = \\frac{160 \\, \\text{mg}}{5 \\, \\text{mL}} = 32 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\n**Part 1: Per-Dose Volumes**\n\n**Ibuprofen Volume ($V_I$)**\n1.  Calculate the mass of a single ibuprofen dose ($m_{I, \\text{dose}}$) based on the child's weight:\n    $$m_{I, \\text{dose}} = D_{I, \\text{dose}} \\times M = (10 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}) \\times (22.7 \\, \\text{kg}) = 227 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n2.  Calculate the corresponding volume ($V_I$) using the formulation's concentration:\n    $$V_I = \\frac{m_{I, \\text{dose}}}{C_I} = \\frac{227 \\, \\text{mg}}{20 \\, \\text{mg/mL}} = 11.35 \\, \\text{mL}$$\n3.  Rounding to three significant figures as required:\n    $$V_I \\approx 11.4 \\, \\text{mL}$$\n\n**Acetaminophen Volume ($V_A$)**\n1.  Calculate the mass of a single acetaminophen dose ($m_{A, \\text{dose}}$) based on the child's weight:\n    $$m_{A, \\text{dose}} = D_{A, \\text{dose}} \\times M = (15 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}) \\times (22.7 \\, \\text{kg}) = 340.5 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n2.

Rounding to three significant figures as required:\n    $$V_A \\approx 10.6 \\, \\text{mL}$$\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Number of Doses in a $24$-Hour Period**\n\nThe maximum number of doses in a $24$-hour period, $N_{\\text{max}}$, is the largest integer that satisfies both the dosing interval constraint and the daily dosage limit.\n$$N_{\\text{max}} = \\min(N_{\\text{interval}}, N_{\\text{daily dose}})$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{interval}}$ is the maximum number of doses allowed by the minimum time interval, and $N_{\\text{daily dose}}$ is the maximum number of doses allowed by the daily mass limit.\n\n**Maximum Ibuprofen Doses ($N_{I, \\text{max}}$)**\n1.  **Interval Constraint:** The minimum dosing interval is $T_{I, \\text{min}} = 6 \\, \\text{hours}$. The maximum number of doses in $\\Delta t = 24 \\, \\text{hours}$ is:\n    $$N_{I, \\text{interval}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta t}{T_{I, \\text{min}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24 \\, \\text{h}}{6 \\, \\text{h}} \\right\\rfloor = 4$$\n2.  **Daily Dose Constraint:** First, determine the effective maximum daily mass, $M_{I, \\text{max, tot}}$, which is the lesser of the weight-based and absolute limits.\n    - Weight-based limit: $D_{I, \\text{max, wt}} \\times M = (40 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}) \\times (22.7 \\, \\text{kg}) = 908 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    - Absolute limit: $D_{I, \\text{max, abs}} = 1200 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    The governing limit is $M_{I, \\text{max, tot}} = \\min(908 \\, \\text{mg}, 1200 \\, \\text{mg}) = 908 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    The maximum number of doses based on this mass limit is:\n    $$N_{I, \\text{daily dose}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{M_{I, \\text{max, tot}}}{m_{I, \\text{dose}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{908 \\, \\text{mg}}{227 \\, \\text{mg}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 4 \\rfloor = 4$$\n3.  **Final Maximum Doses:** The overall maximum number of ibuprofen doses is the minimum of the two constraints:\n    $$N_{I, \\text{max}} = \\min(N_{I, \\text{interval}}, N_{I, \\text{daily dose}}) = \\min(4, 4) = 4$$\n\n**Maximum Acetaminophen Doses ($N_{A, \\text{max}}$)**\n1.  **Interval Constraint:** The minimum dosing interval is $T_{A, \\text{min}} = 4 \\, \\text{hours}$. The maximum number of doses in $\\Delta t = 24 \\, \\text{hours}$ is:\n    $$N_{A, \\text{interval}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{\\Delta t}{T_{A, \\text{min}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{24 \\, \\text{h}}{4 \\, \\text{h}} \\right\\rfloor = 6$$\n2.  **Daily Dose Constraint:** First, determine the effective maximum daily mass, $M_{A, \\text{max, tot}}$, which is the lesser of the weight-based and absolute limits.\n    - Weight-based limit: $D_{A, \\text{max}, wt} \\times M = (75 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}) \\times (22.7 \\, \\text{kg}) = 1702.5 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    - Absolute limit: $D_{A, \\text{max}, abs} = 4000 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    The governing limit is $M_{A, \\text{max, tot}} = \\min(1702.5 \\, \\text{mg}, 4000 \\, \\text{mg}) = 1702.5 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n    The maximum number of doses based on this mass limit is:\n    $$N_{A, \\text{daily dose}} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{M_{A, \\text{max, tot}}}{m_{A, \\text{dose}}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1702.5 \\, \\text{mg}}{340.5 \\, \\text{mg}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 5 \\rfloor = 5$$\n3.  **Final Maximum Doses:** The overall maximum number of acetaminophen doses is the minimum of the two constraints. In this case, the daily dosage constraint is more restrictive than the interval constraint.\n    $$N_{A, \\text{max}} = \\min(N_{A, \\text{interval}}, N_{A, \\text{daily dose}}) = \\min(6, 5) = 5$$\n\nThe four requested values are $V_I = 11.4$, $V_A = 10.6$, $N_{I, \\text{max}} = 4$, and $N_{A, \\text{max}} = 5$.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n\nLet us define the relevant events and probabilities based on the problem statement.\nLet $M$ be the event that the child truly has mumps.\nLet $M^c$ be the event that the child does not have mumps.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the IgM test result is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the IgM test result is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\nThe pre-test probability of mumps, which is the prevalence in this specific clinical context:\n$$P(M) = 0.005$$\nThe sensitivity of the test, which is the probability of a positive test given that the child has mumps:\n$$\\text{sensitivity} = P(T^+ | M) = 0.75$$\nThe specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test given that the child does not have mumps:\n$$\\text{specificity} = P(T^- | M^c) = 0.98$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that the child truly has mumps given a positive IgM result. This is the posterior probability, or positive predictive value, denoted by $P(M | T^+)$.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, we can write:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(M \\cap T^+)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nThe numerator, $P(M \\cap T^+)$, is the joint probability of having mumps and testing positive. We can re-express this using the definition of conditional probability again:\n$$P(M \\cap T^+) = P(T^+ | M) P(M)$$\nThis term represents the true positives.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. We can calculate this using the law of total probability, partitioning the event $T^+$ by the disjoint events $M$ and $M^c$:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap M) + P(T^+ \\cap M^c)$$\nUsing the definition of conditional probability for each term in the sum:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | M) P(M) + P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c)$$\n\nThe first term, $P(T^+ | M) P(M)$, is the probability of a true positive result.\nThe second term, $P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c)$, is the probability of a false positive result.\n\nWe need to determine the components of the second term, $P(T^+ | M^c)$ and $P(M^c)$.\nThe probability of not having mumps, $P(M^c)$, is the complement of having mumps:\n$$P(M^c) = 1 - P(M)$$\n\nThe probability of a positive test given no mumps, $P(T^+ | M^c)$, is the false positive rate. It is related to the specificity. Since a test result can only be positive or negative, for a subject without mumps, the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes must be $1$:\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) + P(T^- | M^c) = 1$$\nTherefore, the false positive rate is:\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) = 1 - P(T^- | M^c) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute all these parts back into the expression for $P(M | T^+)$.\nThe derived expression for the probability that the child has mumps given a positive test, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and pre-test probability, is:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | M) P(M)}{P(T^+ | M) P(M) + (1 - P(T^- | M^c)) (1 - P(M))}$$\nLet's denote the pre-test probability $P(M)$ as $p$. The expression is:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\cdot p + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\cdot (1 - p)}$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given values:\n$p = P(M) = 0.005$\n$\\text{sensitivity} = P(T^+ | M) = 0.75$\n$\\text{specificity} = P(T^- | M^c) = 0.98$\n\nFirst, we calculate the complementary probabilities:\n$1 - p = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$\n$1 - \\text{specificity} = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and the terms in the denominator.\nNumerator (probability of a true positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.75 \\times 0.005 = 0.00375$$\n\nDenominator, Term 1 (probability of a true positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M) P(M) = 0.00375$$\nDenominator, Term 2 (probability of a false positive):\n$$P(T^+ | M^c) P(M^c) = (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\cdot (1 - p) = 0.02 \\times 0.995 = 0.0199$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two terms:\n$$P(T^+) = 0.00375 + 0.0199 = 0.02365$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the posterior probability $P(M | T^+)$:\n$$P(M | T^+) = \\frac{0.00375}{0.02365} \\approx 0.15856236786...$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is in the tenths place, so we need to round to the ten-thousandths place.\n$$P(M | T^+) \\approx 0.1586$$\nThus, given a positive IgM test in this clinical scenario, the probability that the child actually has mumps is approximately $15.86\\%$.",

Per the problem's definition, cumulative incidence is the ratio of new cases to the number of individuals at risk at the start of the observation period.\n\nLet $C_v$ and $N_v$ be the number of cases and the total number of children in the vaccinated group, respectively.\nLet $C_u$ and $N_u$ be the number of cases and the total number of children in the unvaccinated group, respectively.\n\nThe cumulative incidences are thus:\n$$ CI_v = \\frac{C_v}{N_v} $$\n$$ CI_u = \\frac{C_u}{N_u} $$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Relative Risk ($RR$)**\n\nRelative risk ($RR$) is a measure that compares the risk of a health event (disease) in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. In this context, the vaccinated group is the \"exposed\" or intervention group, and the unvaccinated group is the reference or \"unexposed\" group. The relative risk is the ratio of the risk in the vaccinated group to the risk in the unvaccinated group.\n\n$$ RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk in vaccinated group}}{\\text{Risk in unvaccinated group}} $$\nUsing the expressions for cumulative incidence, this becomes:\n$$ RR = \\frac{CI_v}{CI_u} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Vaccine Effectiveness ($VE$)**\n\nVaccine effectiveness ($VE$) is defined as the proportional reduction in disease risk attributable to vaccination. The baseline risk, or the risk without the intervention (vaccine), is the risk in the unvaccinated group, $CI_u$. The risk with the intervention is the risk in the vaccinated group, $CI_v$.\n\nThe absolute reduction in risk due to vaccination is the difference between the risk in the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups: $CI_u - CI_v$.\n\nThe proportional reduction in risk is this absolute reduction divided by the baseline risk ($CI_u$):\n$$ VE = \\frac{CI_u - CI_v}{CI_u} $$\nTo express $VE$ in terms of $RR$, we can algebraically manipulate this expression:\n$$ VE = \\frac{CI_u}{CI_u} - \\frac{CI_v}{CI_u} $$\n$$ VE = 1 - \\frac{CI_v}{CI_u} $$\nFrom Part 1, we know that $RR = \\frac{CI_v}{CI_u}$. Substituting this into the equation for $VE$ gives the desired relationship:\n$$ VE = 1 - RR $$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation of $VE$**\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Vaccinated group: $N_v = 200$, $C_v = 20$\n- Unvaccinated group: $N_u = 50$, $C_u = 10$\n\nFirst, we compute the cumulative incidence for each group:\n$$ CI_v = \\frac{C_v}{N_v} = \\frac{20}{200} = \\frac{1}{10} = 0.1 $$\n$$ CI_u = \\frac{C_u}{N_u} = \\frac{10}{50} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2 $$\nNext, we compute the relative risk ($RR$):\n$$ RR = \\frac{CI_v}{CI_u} = \\frac{0.1}{0.2} = 0.5 $$\nFinally, we use the derived formula for vaccine effectiveness ($VE$) to compute its numerical value:\n$$ VE = 1 - RR = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 $$\nThe vaccine effectiveness is $0.5$. This value represents a $50\\%$ reduction in the risk of developing mumps for the vaccinated group compared to the unvaccinated group during the observation period.
