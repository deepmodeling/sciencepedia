He has a webbed neck, pectus deformity, and a systolic murmur consistent with pulmonary valve stenosis. On examination, the right testis is non-palpable and the left testis is high-riding in the inguinal canal. Standard high-resolution G-banded karyotyping returns as normal with a result of $46,XY$. The principal diagnostic consideration is between Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome, given the overlapping features of short stature, webbed neck, and left-sided or obstructive cardiac lesions in these conditions.\n\nAssume the following in the specialty referral population under consideration before obtaining the karyotype and genital examination details:\n- The pretest probability of Noonan syndrome is $P(N)=0.3$.\n- The pretest probability of Turner syndrome is $P(T)=0.7$.\n\nYou are given feature-specific likelihood ratios (likelihood ratio (LR) defined as $ \\text{LR} = \\dfrac{P(\\text{feature} \\mid N)}{P(\\text{feature} \\mid T)} $) comparing Noonan syndrome to Turner syndrome:\n- For a normal high-resolution karyotype, $\\text{LR}_{\\text{normal karyotype}} = 40$.\n- For the presence of cryptorchidism in this phenotypic male, $\\text{LR}_{\\text{cryptorchidism}} = 20$.\n\nAssume conditional independence of these features given the diagnosis.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard application of Bayesian inference in the context of medical diagnostics, providing all necessary data for a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability of Noonan syndrome, $P(N \\mid E)$, given two pieces of evidence: a normal karyotype ($E_1$) and cryptorchidism ($E_2$). The problem is best solved using the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $N$ be the event that the infant has Noonan syndrome, and $T$ be the event that the infant has Turner syndrome. The problem states that these are the only two considerations, so their probabilities must sum to $1$. The given pretest probabilities are:\n$$P(N) = 0.3$$\n$$P(T) = 0.7$$\nThe sum is $P(N) + P(T) = 0.3 + 0.7 = 1$, which is consistent.\n\nThe odds form of Bayes' theorem relates the prior odds to the posterior odds via the likelihood ratio (LR). The prior odds of Noonan syndrome versus Turner syndrome, $O_{\\text{prior}}(N:T)$, are the ratio of their pretest probabilities:\n$$O_{\\text{prior}}(N:T) = \\frac{P(N)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.3}{0.7} = \\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nThe evidence consists of two findings:\n$E_1$: a normal high-resolution karyotype ($46,XY$).\n$E_2$: the presence of cryptorchidism.\n\nThe problem provides the likelihood ratios for each piece of evidence, comparing Noonan syndrome to Turner syndrome:\n$$\\text{LR}_1 = \\text{LR}_{\\text{normal karyotype}} = \\frac{P(E_1 \\mid N)}{P(E_1 \\mid T)} = 40$$\n$$\\text{LR}_2 = \\text{LR}_{\\text{cryptorchidism}} = \\frac{P(E_2 \\mid N)}{P(E_2 \\mid T)} = 20$$\n\nWe are told to assume that these features are conditionally independent given the diagnosis. This means that the likelihood ratio for the combined evidence, $E = E_1 \\cap E_2$, is the product of the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$\\text{LR}_{\\text{total}} = \\text{LR}(E_1 \\cap E_2) = \\text{LR}_1 \\times \\text{LR}_2$$\n$$\\text{LR}_{\\text{total}} = 40 \\times 20 = 800$$\n\nNow, we can update the prior odds to obtain the posterior odds, $O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E)$, using the formula:\n$$\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Prior Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}$$\n$$O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E) = O_{\\text{prior}}(N:T) \\times \\text{LR}_{\\text{total}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 800 = \\frac{2400}{7}$$\n\nThe posterior odds represent the ratio of the posterior probabilities:\n$$O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E) = \\frac{P(N \\mid E)}{P(T \\mid E)}$$\nSince $N$ and $T$ are the only possibilities, $P(N \\mid E) + P(T \\mid E) = 1$, which implies $P(T \\mid E) = 1 - P(N \\mid E)$.\n$$O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E) = \\frac{P(N \\mid E)}{1 - P(N \\mid E)}$$\n\nWe can solve for the desired posterior probability, $P(N \\mid E)$:\n$$P(N \\mid E) = \\frac{O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E)}{1 + O_{\\text{posterior}}(N:T \\mid E)}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for the posterior odds:\n$$P(N \\mid E) = \\frac{\\frac{2400}{7}}{1 + \\frac{2400}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{2400}{7}}{\\frac{7}{7} + \\frac{2400}{7}} = \\frac{\\frac{2400}{7}}{\\frac{2407}{7}} = \\frac{2400}{2407}$$\n\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{2400}{2407} \\approx 0.9970918155...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.9971$. This high posterior probability indicates that, given the normal male karyotype and the presence of cryptorchidism, the diagnosis is almost certainly Noonan syndrome rather than Turner syndrome.

            "problem": "A $2$-year-old boy presents with short stature, facial dysmorphism (downslanting palpebral fissures, low-set posteriorly rotated ears), pectus excavatum, webbed neck, and congenital heart disease characterized by dysplastic pulmonary valve stenosis on echocardiogram. He has cryptorchidism and feeding difficulties in infancy. Development is mildly delayed. Family history is noncontributory; both parents are phenotypically normal. On clinical grounds, the pediatric genetics team suspects Noonan syndrome, a member of Rat Sarcoma (RAS) pathway disorders (RASopathies). A first-tier targeted multigene RASopathy panel was performed on blood and reported “no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants detected.” The laboratory methods document shows that the panel interrogated coding regions and canonical splice sites in commonly implicated RASopathy genes with sensitivity for single nucleotide variants and small insertions/deletions of approximately $0.98$ and reports detection of mosaic variants only if variant allele fraction (VAF) $\\ge 0.20$. The panel does not include copy-number variant (CNV) detection.\n\nYou are asked to apply a diagnostic algorithm grounded in the Central Dogma of molecular biology (deoxyribonucleic acid to ribonucleic acid to protein), the definition of variant classes (single nucleotide variants, small insertion/deletions, CNVs, and noncoding regulatory variants), and test performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity), to reason what the most appropriate next step in genetic testing should be to maximize diagnostic yield and inform management. For this patient, consider these empirically observed patterns in Noonan syndrome and related RASopathies:\n\n- In confirmed Noonan syndrome, the causal variant distribution can be approximated as: single nucleotide variants and small insertion/deletions in known RASopathy genes $= 0.85$, CNVs affecting one or more RAS pathway genes $= 0.05$, low-level mosaic single nucleotide variants (VAF $< 0.20$) $= 0.05$, and noncoding or deep intronic variants altering splicing or regulation $= 0.05$.\n- The prior probability that this patient’s phenotype is due to a molecularly detectable RASopathy is estimated at $P(D) = 0.70$ based on the constellation of findings and exclusion of other syndromes on clinical grounds.\n- For an unrelated child with similar congenital anomalies who does not have a RASopathy, the chance that a targeted RASopathy panel returns negative is high, approximated by $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.99$.\n\nFrom first principles, use these distributions and the test characteristics to determine whether the negative targeted panel meaningfully lowers the posterior probability of a RASopathy and, based on the residual mechanism space (CNV, mosaicism, noncoding), select the next test(s) with the greatest expected yield and clinical utility. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n\nA. Order chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) to detect CNVs and, if negative, proceed to trio clinical exome sequencing with exome-based CNV calling and careful reanalysis of RASopathy genes; consider testing a second tissue (for example, skin fibroblasts) if clinical suspicion of mosaicism remains high.\n\nB. Repeat the same targeted RASopathy gene panel in $6$ months to rule out a laboratory error; defer CNV or exome testing unless new features appear.\n\nC. Conclude the diagnosis is clinical Noonan syndrome without molecular confirmation and avoid additional genetic testing to minimize cost, focusing on cardiology and endocrinology surveillance.\n\nD. Perform a conventional karyotype only, because whole-chromosome aneuploidies account for most unexplained Noonan-like presentations after a negative gene panel.\n\nE. Order single-gene testing for SHOC2 only, because SHOC2 accounts for most panel-negative Noonan cases and targeted testing has higher sensitivity than exome.\n\nSelect the best option.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the most appropriate next step in the genetic diagnostic workup for a $2$-year-old boy with a classic presentation of Noonan syndrome, following a negative first-tier targeted gene panel. To solve this, we must first validate the problem statement, then apply principles of molecular genetics, test performance characteristics, and Bayesian inference to determine the posterior probability of a RASopathy and analyze the remaining diagnostic possibilities.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Patient Phenotype:** $2$-year-old boy with short stature, downslanting palpebral fissures, low-set posteriorly rotated ears, pectus excavatum, webbed neck, dysplastic pulmonary valve stenosis, cryptorchidism, feeding difficulties, and mild developmental delay.\n- **Family History:** Noncontributory; parents are phenotypically normal.\n- **Clinical Suspicion:** Noonan syndrome.\n- **Initial Test:** Targeted multigene RASopathy panel on blood.\n- **Initial Test Result:** Negative (\"no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants detected\").\n- **Initial Test Limitations:**\n    - Assesses coding regions and canonical splice sites.\n    - Sensitivity for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions is $\\approx 0.98$.\n    - Mosaic variants are reported only if the variant allele fraction (VAF) is $\\ge 0.20$.\n    - Does not detect copy-number variants (CNVs).\n- **A Priori Probabilities and Distributions:**\n    - Prior probability of the patient having a molecularly detectable RASopathy: $P(D) = 0.70$.\n    - For true positive cases, the approximate distribution of causal variants is:\n        - $P(\\text{SNV/indel} \\mid D) = 0.85$ (detectable by the panel's core technology).\n        - $P(\\text{CNV} \\mid D) = 0.05$.\n        - $P(\\text{low-level mosaic} \\mid D)$ where VAF $< 0.20$ is $0.05$.\n        - $P(\\text{noncoding/deep intronic} \\mid D) = 0.05$.\n    - Probability of a negative panel result in a patient who does not have a RASopathy: $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.99$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The clinical description of Noonan syndrome, the genetic mechanisms (SNVs, indels, CNVs, mosaicism), the testing technologies (gene panel, chromosomal microarray, exome sequencing), and their respective limitations are all consistent with current medical genetics principles and practice. The use of Bayesian reasoning to update diagnostic probability is a standard and rigorous method in medical decision-making.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient quantitative data (prior probability, conditional probabilities, test characteristics) to perform the required calculations. The question asks for the \"most appropriate next step,\" which can be determined by identifying the diagnostic strategies that best address the remaining, un-tested etiological possibilities.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is presented in a clinical, objective format, free of subjective or biased language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The premises are consistent, scientifically sound, and sufficient for a rigorous derivation of the answer. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Optimal Next Step\n\n**1. Calculate the Likelihood of a Negative Test Given a RASopathy, $P(\\text{negative} \\mid D)$**\nA negative test result in a patient who truly has a RASopathy ($D$) can occur for two reasons:\n(a) The patient has a type of variant that the panel is not designed to detect.\n(b) The patient has a type of variant the panel is designed to detect, but the test fails (a false negative).\n\nThe probability of (a) is the sum of probabilities for the mechanisms the panel misses:\n$P(\\text{missed mechanism} \\mid D) = P(\\text{CNV} \\mid D) + P(\\text{low-level mosaic} \\mid D) + P(\\text{noncoding} \\mid D)$\n$P(\\text{missed mechanism} \\mid D) = 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.05 = 0.15$\n\nThe probability of (b) is the probability of having a standard SNV/indel multiplied by the test's false negative rate. The sensitivity for these variants is $S_{panel} = 0.98$, so the false negative rate is $1 - S_{panel} = 0.02$.\n$P(\\text{false negative SNV/indel} \\mid D) = P(\\text{SNV/indel} \\mid D) \\times (1 - S_{panel})$\n$P(\\text{false negative SNV/indel} \\mid D) = 0.85 \\times 0.02 = 0.017$\n\nThe total probability of a negative result given the disease is the sum of these mutually exclusive possibilities:\n$P(\\text{negative} \\mid D) = P(\\text{missed mechanism} \\mid D) + P(\\text{false negative SNV/indel} \\mid D)$\n$P(\\text{negative} \\mid D) = 0.15 + 0.017 = 0.167$\n\n**2. Calculate the Posterior Probability of a RASopathy, $P(D \\mid \\text{negative})$**\nWe use Bayes' theorem to update the initial probability of disease, $P(D) = 0.70$, given the negative test result.\nThe formula is:\n$$P(D \\mid \\text{negative}) = \\frac{P(\\text{negative} \\mid D) P(D)}{P(\\text{negative})}$$\nFirst, we calculate the total probability of a negative result, $P(\\text{negative})$, using the law of total probability:\n$P(\\text{negative}) = P(\\text{negative} \\mid D)P(D) + P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg D)P(\\neg D)$\nWe are given $P(D) = 0.70$, so $P(\\neg D) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30$. We are also given $P(\\text{negative} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.99$.\n$P(\\text{negative}) = (0.167 \\times 0.70) + (0.99 \\times 0.30)$\n$P(\\text{negative}) = 0.1169 + 0.297 = 0.4139$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior probability:\n$P(D \\mid \\text{negative}) = \\frac{0.1169}{0.4139} \\approx 0.2824$\n\nThe negative panel reduces the probability of a RASopathy from $70\\%$ to approximately $28\\%$. While this is a significant reduction, a $28\\%$ chance remains a substantial clinical possibility, justifying further investigation.\n\n**3. Analyze the Remaining Diagnostic Space**\nIf the patient does have a RASopathy despite the negative panel (a $\\approx 28\\%$ chance), we need to determine the most likely underlying cause. We can find the relative proportions of the different causes of a negative result in a true positive case:\n- Cause is CNV: probability contribution is $0.05$.\n- Cause is low-level mosaicism: probability contribution is $0.05$.\n- Cause is a noncoding variant: probability contribution is $0.05$.\n- Cause is a missed SNV/indel (false negative): probability contribution is $0.017$.\n\nThe total probability of these events is $0.167$. The relative contribution of each mechanism to the \"panel-negative\" group of RASopathy patients is:\n- CNV: $0.05 / 0.167 \\approx 0.299$ (or $\\approx 30\\%$)\n- Low-level mosaicism: $0.05 / 0.167 \\approx 0.299$ (or $\\approx 30\\%$)\n- Noncoding variant: $0.05 / 0.167 \\approx 0.299$ (or $\\approx 30\\%$)\n- Missed SNV/indel: $0.017 / 0.167 \\approx 0.102$ (or $\\approx 10\\%$)\n\nThis analysis demonstrates that the diagnostic gap is primarily composed of three roughly equal components: CNVs, low-level mosaicism, and noncoding variants. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is a strategy that addresses these major remaining possibilities.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Order chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) to detect CNVs and, if negative, proceed to trio clinical exome sequencing with exome-based CNV calling and careful reanalysis of RASopathy genes; consider testing a second tissue (for example, skin fibroblasts) if clinical suspicion of mosaicism remains high.**\nThis option presents a multi-step, systematic approach.\n1.  **CMA first:** This is the gold-standard test for detecting CNVs and directly targets one of the three main ($\\approx 30\\%$) reasons for the negative panel. This is a high-yield first step.\n2.  **Trio exome sequencing next:** If CMA is negative, this powerful test can investigate the remaining possibilities. It is excellent for finding *de novo* SNVs/indels in known or novel genes and, with careful analysis, can help identify noncoding/splice-altering variants. This addresses the noncoding variant ($\\approx 30\\%$) and missed SNV/indel ($\\approx 10\\%$) categories.\n3.  **Consider a second tissue:** This explicitly addresses the third major diagnostic possibility, low-level mosaicism ($\\approx 30\\%$), which may be undetectable in blood.\nThis strategy is comprehensive and logically sequenced to maximize diagnostic yield.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Repeat the same targeted RASopathy gene panel in $6$ months to rule out a laboratory error; defer CNV or exome testing unless new features appear.**\nThe probability of a false negative due to technical error on the panel accounts for only $\\approx 10\\%$ of the diagnostic gap. Repeating the test is therefore a low-yield strategy. More importantly, it fails to address the known, significant limitations of the panel's methodology (inability to detect CNVs, low-level mosaicism, certain noncoding variants), which together account for $\\approx 90\\%$ of the diagnostic gap. Delaying further, more informative testing is clinically inappropriate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Conclude the diagnosis is clinical Noonan syndrome without molecular confirmation and avoid additional genetic testing to minimize cost, focusing on cardiology and endocrinology surveillance.**\nWhile surveillance is essential, abandoning the diagnostic search is premature. The posterior probability of finding a molecular cause is still substantial ($\\approx 28\\%$). A specific molecular diagnosis can provide critical prognostic information (e.g., relating to cancer risk or cardiomyopathy type, which vary by gene) and allow for accurate recurrence risk counseling for the family. The principle of maximizing diagnostic yield and informing management argues against this option.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perform a conventional karyotype only, because whole-chromosome aneuploidies account for most unexplained Noonan-like presentations after a negative gene panel.**\nA conventional karyotype has a much lower resolution than a CMA. It is designed to detect large-scale abnormalities like aneuploidy, not the smaller CNVs (microdeletions/microduplications) that constitute $~5\\%$ of Noonan syndrome cases. The claim that whole-chromosome aneuploidies are the *most common* explanation after a negative panel is factually incorrect; the mechanisms missed by the panel (including submicroscopic CNVs) are far more likely. CMA is the superior test for investigating CNVs in this context.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Order single-gene testing for SHOC2 only, because SHOC2 accounts for most panel-negative Noonan cases and targeted testing has higher sensitivity than exome.**\nThe initial multigene panel would have almost certainly included *SHOC2*, a major gene for Noonan syndrome. The panel's sensitivity for SNVs/indels is already high at $0.98$. The chance of a single-gene test finding a standard SNV missed by a high-quality panel is very small (part of the $\\approx 10\\%$ false-negative bucket). This strategy is based on a narrow and questionable premise and completely ignores the far more likely causes of a negative panel result: CNVs ($\\approx 30\\%$), mosaicism ($\\approx 30\\%$), and noncoding variants ($\\approx 30\\%$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on this rigorous analysis, the strategy outlined in option A is the most scientifically sound and clinically appropriate.",

The secondary task is to outline an appropriate monitoring plan.\n\n**Part 1: Dose Calculation**\n\nThe calculation is based on the principle of weight-based dosing. The total daily dose is the product of the patient's weight and the prescribed dose rate.\n\nLet $W$ be the child's weight.\nLet $D_{\\text{rate}}$ be the label-recommended starting dose rate.\nLet $D_{\\text{daily}}$ be the total daily dose.\n\nThe given values are:\n- Patient's weight, $W = 18\\,\\text{kg}$\n- Recommended dose rate, $D_{\\text{rate}} = 0.035\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}$\n\nThe relationship between these quantities is:\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = W \\times D_{\\text{rate}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the equation:\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = 18\\,\\text{kg} \\times 0.035\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication, the units of kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) cancel, yielding a result in milligrams per day ($\\text{mg/day}$):\n$$D_{\\text{daily}} = 0.63\\,\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.

Safety monitoring is particularly critical due to the known comorbidities of Noonan syndrome, which can be potentially influenced by GH. The plan is divided into baseline assessments (prior to therapy initiation) and interval follow-up.\n\n**Baseline Assessments (Pre-Therapy)**\n\n1.  **Auxology:** Measurement of height, weight, head circumference, sitting height, and calculation of height Standard Deviation Score (SDS) and Body Mass Index (BMI). Photographic documentation of facial features.\n2.  **Endocrine-Metabolic:** Blood tests including Insulin-like Growth Factor $1$ (IGF-$1$), IGF-Binding Protein $3$ (IGFBP-$3$) to establish a baseline. Fasting glucose and Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to screen for baseline glucose intolerance, as GH can induce insulin resistance. Thyroid function tests (TSH, free T$4$), as undiagnosed hypothyroidism can blunt the growth response to GH.\n3.  **Cardiology:** A comprehensive evaluation by a pediatric cardiologist, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an echocardiogram. This is critical to assess for congenital heart defects, especially pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). GH is relatively contraindicated in the presence of severe, untreated HCM due to concerns about promoting further myocardial growth.\n4.  **Hematology-Oncology:** A complete blood count (CBC) with differential. Individuals with Noonan syndrome have a predisposition to certain myeloproliferative disorders and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Establishing a hematologic baseline is a prudent safety measure.\n5.  **Neurology-Ophthalmology:** A formal ophthalmologic examination, including fundoscopy, to rule out pre-existing optic disc abnormalities. This establishes a baseline against which to monitor for papilledema, a sign of benign intracranial hypertension, which is a rare side effect of GH therapy. Clinical neurological assessment for any signs suggestive of a Chiari malformation.\n6.  **Musculoskeletal:** A clinical examination of the spine for scoliosis. If clinically indicated, a baseline spine radiograph is warranted.\n7.  **Sleep-Respiratory:** A thorough clinical history for symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) such as snoring, apneas, and daytime sleepiness. Given the craniofacial features and potential for adenotonsillar hypertrophy in Noonan syndrome, a baseline polysomnogram (sleep study) should be strongly considered, especially if symptoms are present, as GH can exacerbate SDB.\n\n**Interval Follow-up (During Therapy)**\n\n1.  **Auxology (every $3$-$4$ months):** Monitoring of height, weight, and calculation of height velocity. The primary goal is to achieve an increase in height velocity and an improvement in height SDS. This is the main measure of *efficacy*.\n2.  **Endocrine-Metabolic (annually, or more frequently if indicated):** Monitoring of IGF-$1$ levels to ensure they remain within the upper-normal or slightly above-normal range, guarding against over-treatment. Annual screening with fasting glucose and/or HbA1c for the development of insulin resistance or diabetes.\n3.  **Cardiology (annually, or as directed by cardiology):** Repeat echocardiography to monitor cardiac morphology and function, with special attention to any changes in myocardial thickness, particularly in patients with baseline HCM.\n4.  **Hematology-Oncology:** Clinical vigilance for signs such as unexplained bruising, petechiae, fever, or lymphadenopathy. An annual CBC is a reasonable screening measure.\n5.  **Neurology-Ophthalmology:** At each visit, inquire about new or worsening headaches, vision changes, or vomiting. Any concerning symptoms should prompt an immediate ophthalmologic evaluation with fundoscopy to assess for papilledema.\n6.  **Musculoskeletal (at each visit):** Clinical monitoring for the development or progression of scoliosis. Parents should be educated about the signs of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), a known risk of GH therapy, which presents as a limp and/or hip, groin, or knee pain.\n7.  **Sleep-Respiratory (at each visit):** Clinical inquiry about new or worsening symptoms of SDB. A low threshold should be maintained for a repeat polysomnogram if symptoms develop or worsen.",
