            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in developmental biology, specifically concerning the embryological origins of craniofacial clefts. I must validate the problem statement and then, if it is valid, solve it by applying the provided principles to determine the most likely outcomes of teratogenic insults at two distinct time points.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem statement provides the following information:\n1.  **Insult Type**: Transient teratogenic exposures.\n2.  **Insult Duration**: $\\Delta t = 48$ hours.\n3.  **Insult Timings**: Post-Conception Day (PCD) $36$ and PCD $50$.\n4.  **Baseline Condition**: Development is otherwise unperturbed.\n5.  **Foundational Fact 1**: Craniofacial morphogenesis is a time-ordered sequence.\n6.  **Foundational Fact 2**: The primary palate, which includes the upper lip and the alveolus anterior to the incisive foramen, forms from the fusion of the medial nasal and maxillary prominences.\n7.  **Foundational Fact 3**: The secondary palate, consisting of the palatal shelves posterior to the incisive foramen, elevates and fuses *after* the formation of the primary palate.\n8.  **Foundational Fact 4**: Organ systems are most susceptible to teratogens during their period of active morphogenesis.\n9.  **Question**: Determine the most likely cleft phenotype for an insult at PCD $36$ and an insult at PCD $50$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nI will now assess the validity of the problem statement based on the extracted givens.\n\n-   **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of human embryology. The timeline of craniofacial development is well-characterized. The formation of the primary palate (including lip fusion) occurs predominantly between the 4th and 7th weeks of gestation. The formation and fusion of the secondary palate occur later, primarily between the 6th and 9th weeks.\n    -   An insult at PCD $36$ ($36$ days $\\approx 5.1$ weeks) falls squarely within the critical period for the fusion of the facial prominences to form the lip and primary palate.\n    -   An insult at PCD $50$ ($50$ days $\\approx 7.1$ weeks) falls within the critical period for the elevation and fusion of the palatal shelves to form the secondary palate, a time when primary palate formation is largely complete.\n    -   The principle of maximum teratogenic susceptibility during active organogenesis is a fundamental concept in toxicology and developmental biology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides clear initial conditions (insult timings), a set of rules (embryological principles), and asks for a definite output (phenotypes). A unique, logical solution can be derived from the premises.\n\n-   **Objectivity**: The language is clinical, precise, and objective, using standard anatomical and embryological terminology (e.g., primary/secondary palate, incisive foramen, medial nasal prominence). There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, ambiguity). It is a standard application of embryological principles to a clinical scenario.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by applying the principle that a teratogenic insult will most profoundly affect the structure(s) undergoing active morphogenesis at the time of the insult.\n\n**1. Analysis of the PCD $36$ Insult:**\n\n-   PCD $36$ corresponds to the 6th week of gestation (week $5+1$ day).\n-   According to the provided facts and established embryology, this is the critical period for the formation of the **primary palate**.\n-   This process involves the fusion of the two medial nasal prominences with each other in the midline and, crucially for the lip, the fusion of each medial nasal prominence with the ipsilateral maxillary prominence.\n-   A teratogenic insult of duration $\\Delta t = 48$ hours at PCD $36$ would disrupt this fusion process.\n-   Failure of fusion between a medial nasal prominence and a maxillary prominence results in a cleft of the lip, which may extend posteriorly to involve the alveolar ridge up to the incisive foramen (a cleft of the primary palate).\n-   At this early stage (PCD $36$), the secondary palate has not yet begun its final fusion process. The palatal shelves are still vertically oriented on either side of the tongue.\n-   Therefore, the most likely phenotype resulting from an insult at PCD $36$ is a cleft of the primary palate (cleft lip with or without cleft alveolus), with an intact secondary palate.\n\n**2. Analysis of the PCD $50$ Insult:**\n\n-   PCD $50$ corresponds to the 8th week of gestation (week $7+1$ day).\n-   By this time, the fusion of the prominences forming the lip and primary palate is complete. The lip and premaxillary alveolar structures are intact.\n-   This period is the critical window for the formation of the **secondary palate**. The process involves the elevation of the two palatal shelves from a vertical to a horizontal position above the tongue, followed by their fusion with each other in the midline and with the primary palate anteriorly and the nasal septum superiorly.\n-   A teratogenic insult of duration $\\Delta t = 48$ hours at PCD $50$ would interfere with the elevation or fusion of these palatal shelves.\n-   Failure of this process results in a cleft of the secondary palate, which can affect the hard palate, the soft palate, or both, posterior to the incisive foramen.\n-   Since the primary palate is already formed, the lip and anterior alveolus will be unaffected.\n-   Therefore, the most likely phenotype resulting from an insult at PCD $50$ is an isolated cleft of the secondary palate, with an intact lip and alveolus.\n\n**Summary of Predictions:**\n-   **PCD $36$ Insult**: Cleft lip +/- cleft alveolus (primary palate defect).\n-   **PCD $50$ Insult**: Isolated cleft of the hard and/or soft palate (secondary palate defect).\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow, I will evaluate each option against these derived predictions.\n\n**A. PCD $36$: complete unilateral cleft lip with possible alveolar (primary palate) involvement; PCD $50$: isolated cleft of secondary palate (hard and/or soft palate) with an intact lip and alveolus.**\n-   The phenotype described for PCD $36$ (cleft lip and primary palate) is precisely what is expected from an insult during the fusion of the facial prominences.\n-   The phenotype for PCD $50$ (isolated cleft of the secondary palate with intact anterior structures) is precisely what is expected from an insult during the fusion of the palatal shelves, after the lip has already formed.\n-   This option aligns perfectly with the embryological principles.\n-   **Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. PCD $36$: isolated cleft of secondary palate; PCD $50$: microform cleft lip (healed notch) with intact palate.**\n-   This option incorrectly reverses the developmental timeline. An early insult at PCD $36$ is incorrectly mapped to the later-forming secondary palate. A later insult at PCD $50$ is incorrectly mapped to the earlier-forming primary palate (lip).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. PCD $36$: median (midline) cleft lip due to failure of medial nasal process fusion; PCD $50$: bilateral complete cleft lip and palate.**\n-   For PCD $36$, a median cleft lip is a possible but very rare outcome of early frontonasal process disruption. The more common outcome is a unilateral or bilateral cleft. However, the PCD $50$ pathology is definitively wrong.\n-   For PCD $50$, an insult at this time should not cause a cleft lip, as the lip has already formed. A \"bilateral complete cleft lip and palate\" requires disruption of *both* primary and secondary palate formation. An insult at PCD $50$ affects only the secondary palate.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. PCD $36$: complete bilateral cleft lip and complete cleft palate due to interruption of secondary palate fusion; PCD $50$: no craniofacial cleft because primary and secondary palates have already fused.**\n-   For PCD $36$, the claim that a cleft palate is caused \"due to interruption of secondary palate fusion\" is incorrect. The insult at this time affects the primary palate; the secondary palate has not yet begun to fuse.\n-   For PCD $50$, the claim that \"primary and secondary palates have already fused\" is factually incorrect. The secondary palate is in the middle of its critical fusion period at PCD $50$. An insult at this time is highly likely to cause a cleft.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. PCD $36$: normal lip and palate; PCD $50$: Pierre Robin sequence with U-shaped cleft palate due to mandibular hypoplasia and glossoptosis, with normal lip.**\n-   For PCD $36$, the claim of a \"normal lip and palate\" is incorrect. PCD $36$ is a highly sensitive period for primary palate formation, and an insult is likely to cause a defect.\n-   For PCD $50$, a cleft palate with a normal lip is consistent with the timing. Pierre Robin sequence is a specific syndrome where mandibular hypoplasia is the primary defect leading to a U-shaped cleft. While a teratogen at PCD $50$ could potentially induce this, option A's description of an \"isolated cleft of secondary palate\" is a more direct and universally applicable consequence of palatal shelf fusion failure, without invoking the specific mechanism of mandibular hypoplasia. The primary reason this option is wrong is the incorrect assertion for the PCD $36$ outcome.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of the provided embryological principles, only Option A correctly maps the timing of the teratogenic insult to the corresponding developmental process and resulting phenotype.",

            "solution": "The user requires a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a detailed, principle-based derivation of the solution and an evaluation of all options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Patient Profile**: Term infant, age $7$ weeks.\n- **Diagnosis**: Complete unilateral cleft lip and palate on the left.\n- **Clinical Findings**: Alveolar gap of $12$ mm, significant displacement of the lesser segment, ipsilateral nasal ala collapse.\n- **Growth**: Birth weight $3.2$ kg, current weight $4.2$ kg, gaining approximately $20$ g/day.\n- **Feeding**: Uses a specialty bottle.\n- **Logistical Constraints**: Family lives $200$ km from the center; can attend clinic appointments at most once every $4$ to $5$ weeks; cannot relocate.\n- **Surgical Timeline**: Primary lip repair tentatively scheduled for age $16$ weeks.\n- **Caregiver Constraints**: Motivated but have limited time for daily appliance hygiene beyond routine feeding care.\n- **Guiding Principles**:\n    1. Nasal cartilage pliability is maximal in the first $4$-$6$ weeks postnatally due to maternal estrogen and diminishes thereafter.\n    2. Effective and safe Nasoalveolar Molding (NAM) requires frequent (typically weekly) adjustments.\n    3. Presurgical orthopedics aim to reduce cleft width and improve nasal symmetry for tension-minimized repair at approximately $3$-$6$ months of age.\n    4. Inadequate follow-up during molding carries high risks (malfitting appliances, mucosal breakdown, candidiasis, poor weight gain).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles in craniofacial surgery and orthodontics. The physiological state of the neonate (cartilage pliability), the mechanics and requirements of NAM, and the goals of presurgical treatment are all factually and scientifically sound. The patient's clinical presentation (cleft width, weight gain) is realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a complex but well-defined clinical scenario. It asks for the \"most appropriate presurgical plan,\" requiring the application of the given principles to a specific set of constraints (patient factors, logistics, caregiver capacity). This structure allows for a reasoned deduction of a single best course of action from the choices provided.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The patient's condition and the family's circumstances are described factually, without subjective or emotional loading.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-constructed clinical case presenting a realistic dilemma that requires a careful balancing of benefits, risks, and feasibility based on the provided principles. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe central task is to determine the most appropriate management plan for a $7$-week-old infant with a wide cleft lip and palate, considering significant logistical and practical barriers to ideal care. The decision hinges on a risk-benefit analysis guided by the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Indication for Presurgical Orthopedics**: The infant has a $12$ mm alveolar gap and significant nasal deformity. A large gap like this makes a tension-free primary lip repair more challenging. Therefore, in principle, the infant is a strong candidate for some form of presurgical orthopedics to reduce the gap and improve nasal symmetry, aligning with Principle 3.\n\n2.  **Evaluate the Feasibility and Safety of NAM**:\n    - **Timing**: The infant is $7$ weeks old. According to Principle 1, the period of maximal nasal cartilage pliability due to maternal estrogens ($4$ to $6$ weeks) has passed. While molding is still possible, the potential for nasal correction is diminished compared to starting earlier.\n    - **Follow-Up Frequency**: Principle 2 states that effective and safe NAM requires weekly adjustments. The family can only attend every $4$ to $5$ weeks. This is a critical mismatch. An appliance that is not adjusted for a month will become ill-fitting as the infant grows and the alveolar segments move. This leads to either a loss of effective molding force or, more dangerously, the application of improper pressure, causing tissue damage.\n    - **Risk of Complications**: Principle 4 explicitly warns that inadequate follow-up leads to risks such as mucosal breakdown, candidiasis, and poor weight gain. Given the family's inability to travel and limited time for complex hygiene, these risks are unacceptably high. The infant is currently thriving (gaining $20$ g/day), and introducing a high-risk intervention that could jeopardize feeding and growth would be poor clinical judgment.\n\n3.  **Synthesize the Core Conflict**: There is a clear conflict between the clinical indication for reducing the cleft width (Principle 3) and the absolute contraindication for a standard NAM protocol due to safety concerns (Principles 2 and 4). Any appropriate plan must resolve this conflict by prioritizing patient safety. Therefore, a conventional NAM protocol is not a viable option.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Initiate NAM immediately and postpone lip repair to age $6$ to $7$ months to allow $12$ to $16$ weeks of molding, with telehealth guiding home adjustments between monthly in-person visits.**\nThis option attempts to implement NAM by using telehealth for adjustments. Adjusting a NAM appliance involves precise modification of the acrylic plate and wire nasal stent to control force vectors—a task requiring tactile skill and clinical judgment to avoid tissue damage. It cannot be safely and effectively delegated to caregivers via video calls. This plan directly violates the safety requirements implicit in Principle 2 and magnifies the risks cited in Principle 4. Postponing surgery without a high likelihood of benefit is not justified (Principle 3).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Do not initiate NAM; institute structured lip taping with caregiver education and remote photo checks, maintain feeding optimization, and proceed with primary lip repair at age $16$ weeks, considering intraoperative strategies if closure tension is anticipated.**\nThis plan correctly identifies that standard NAM is contraindicated. It proposes a safer, lower-intensity alternative: structured lip taping. Lip taping applies gentle, continuous force across the cleft, which can modestly reduce the alveolar gap and improve lip alignment. It is a technique caregivers can safely manage at home with remote supervision (photo checks). It does not interfere with feeding, has a low risk of complications, and requires minimal hygiene beyond normal care. This approach prioritizes safety, respects the family's constraints, maintains the optimal surgical timeline ($16$ weeks is approximately $4$ months, which is within the $3$-$6$ month window of Principle 3), and prepares the surgical team to handle a potentially wider cleft, which is a standard part of surgical practice. This plan represents the best balance of benefit, risk, and feasibility.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Initiate NAM now but schedule in-person adjustments every $4$ to $5$ weeks to accommodate caregiver capacity; instruct parents to increase daily taping and appliance wear time to compensate.**\nThis option dangerously proceeds with NAM despite the inadequate follow-up schedule. Increased taping or wear time cannot compensate for an ill-fitting appliance that requires professional adjustment. An appliance left unadjusted for $4$-$5$ weeks on a rapidly growing infant is a significant hazard for mucosal ulceration and feeding disruption, directly contradicting the safety tenets of Principles 2 and 4.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Avoid NAM and instead place a surgically anchored active appliance (for example, a Latham device) under general anesthesia to reduce the frequency of clinic visits while achieving similar presurgical alignment.**\nA Latham device is an aggressive, invasive option. It requires a separate surgical procedure under general anesthesia for its placement, introducing risks associated with anesthesia and surgery. While it reduces the need for frequent *orthodontic adjustments*, it is not without risks, including pain, feeding difficulty, and potential damage to unerupted teeth. Choosing such an invasive method as the primary plan, when a safer, non-surgical approach like lip taping (Option B) exists, is not the most appropriate course of action. This option would be considered only if less invasive methods were not viable or had failed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Forgo alveolar molding but begin at-home nasal conformers alone to improve nasal symmetry until surgery, reserving any adjustments for the planned monthly clinic visit.**\nThis option is biomechanically flawed. Nasal molding with a stent is most effective when anchored to a stable intraoral plate (the 'A' in NAM). Without this alveolar plate, a nasal conformer lacks a stable base, making it difficult to control the molding forces and risking irritation or pressure sores within the nostril. This approach also completely neglects the $12$ mm alveolar defect, which is a primary contributor to the nasal base deformity. Furthermore, even a standalone conformer requires frequent monitoring for safety, making a $4$-$5$ week interval risky.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The solution is organized into three parts corresponding to the three tasks.\n\n**Part 1: Single-Dose Amounts**\n\nThe single-dose amounts for morphine ($D_{\\mathrm{m}}$) and acetaminophen ($D_{\\mathrm{a}}$) are calculated by multiplying the prescribed weight-based dose by the infant's mass, $m = 7.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n\nFor morphine, the dose is $0.1\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{m}} = (0.1\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\times (7.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nFor acetaminophen, the dose is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{a}} = (15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\times (7.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 112.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Part 2: Minimum Safe Redosing Interval for Morphine ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$)**\n\nThe minimum safe interval for morphine, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$, is determined by the constraint on drug accumulation at steady state. The problem assumes first-order elimination and repeated identical bolus dosing at a fixed interval $\\tau$.\n\nUnder first-order elimination, the concentration $C(t)$ of a drug at time $t$ after a single bolus dose is given by $C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-kt)$, where $C_0$ is the initial concentration and $k$ is the elimination rate constant. The rate constant is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$.\n\nWhen a dose $D$ is given repeatedly at intervals of $\\tau$, the drug accumulates. The peak concentration immediately after the first dose is $C_{\\mathrm{1,max}} = D/V_d$, where $V_d$ is the volume of distribution. The peak concentration at steady state, $C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}}$, is the sum of the peak from the current dose and the residual concentrations from all previous doses. This forms a geometric series:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}} = C_{\\mathrm{1,max}} + C_{\\mathrm{1,max}}\\exp(-k\\tau) + C_{\\mathrm{1,max}}\\exp(-2k\\tau) + \\dots$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}} = C_{\\mathrm{1,max}} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\exp(-k\\tau)\\right)^n$$\nThe sum of this geometric series is $\\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}$. Therefore, the relationship between the steady-state peak and the initial peak is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}} = C_{\\mathrm{1,max}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\right)$$\nThe accumulation factor, $R_{\\mathrm{acc}}$, is defined as the ratio $C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}}/C_{\\mathrm{1,max}}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{acc}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{ss,max}}}{C_{\\mathrm{1,max}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)}$$\nThe problem imposes the constraint that this ratio must not exceed $1.5$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\le 1.5$$\nSubstituting the expression for $R_{\\mathrm{acc}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)} \\le 1.5$$\nTo find the minimum interval $\\tau$, we solve this inequality for $\\tau$:\n$$1 \\le 1.5 \\left(1 - \\exp(-k\\tau)\\right)$$\n$$1 \\le 1.5 - 1.5 \\exp(-k\\tau)$$\n$$1.5 \\exp(-k\\tau) \\le 1.5 - 1 = 0.5$$\n$$\\exp(-k\\tau) \\le \\frac{0.5}{1.5} = \\frac{1}{3}$$\nApplying the natural logarithm to both sides:\n$$-k\\tau \\le \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = -\\ln(3)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$k\\tau \\ge \\ln(3)$$\n$$\\tau \\ge \\frac{\\ln(3)}{k}$$\nThe minimum safe interval is therefore $\\tau_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{k}$. Substituting $k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)/t_{1/2}} = t_{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nFor morphine, $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{m}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nNumerically, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx (3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\times \\frac{1.09861}{0.69315} \\approx (3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\times 1.58496 \\approx 4.75488\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n**Part 3: Minimum Safe Redosing Interval for Acetaminophen ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}$)**\n\nThe minimum safe interval for acetaminophen, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}$, is the larger of the intervals derived from two separate constraints: the accumulation limit and the maximum daily dose.\n\n1.  **Interval from Accumulation Constraint ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{a,acc}}$)**:\n    The accumulation constraint is the same as for morphine ($R_{\\mathrm{acc}} \\le 1.5$), and the half-life is also given as $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{a}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$. Therefore, the derivation and the resulting minimum interval from this constraint are identical to that for morphine.\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{a,acc}} = t_{1/2,\\mathrm{a}} \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx 4.75488\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n\n2.  **Interval from Maximum Daily Dose Constraint ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{a,daily}}$)**:\n    The dose per dose is $15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$, and the maximum daily exposure is $60\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$. If a dose is administered every $\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}$ hours, the number of doses in a $24$-hour period is $N = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{h}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}}$. The total daily dose per kilogram is the number of doses multiplied by the dose per kilogram per dose.\n    $$N \\times (15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\le 60\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$$\n    $$\\left(\\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{h}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right) \\times (15\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}) \\le 60\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg/day}$$\n    Solving for the minimum interval $\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}$:\n    $$\\frac{24 \\times 15}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}}} \\le 60$$\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}} \\ge \\frac{24 \\times 15}{60}$$\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}} \\ge \\frac{360}{60}$$\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}} \\ge 6\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n    Thus, the minimum interval based on the daily dose limit is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{a,daily}} = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n\n3.  **Binding Minimum Interval for Acetaminophen**:\n    The problem states that the binding interval is the larger of the two calculated minimums.\n    $$\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}} = \\max(\\tau_{\\mathrm{a,acc}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{a,daily}}) = \\max(4.75488\\,\\mathrm{h}, 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}) = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\n\n**Final Numerical Answers**\n\nRounding the calculated values to three significant figures as required:\n-   Morphine dose: $D_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\rightarrow 0.750\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Morphine interval: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 4.75488\\,\\mathrm{h} \\rightarrow 4.75\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n-   Acetaminophen dose: $D_{\\mathrm{a}} = 112.5\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\rightarrow 113\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n-   Acetaminophen interval: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{a}} = 6.0\\,\\mathrm{h} \\rightarrow 6.00\\,\\mathrm{h}$",
