            "problem": "A 6-month-old infant with conotruncal cardiac anomaly, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and hypocalcemia undergoes clinical Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) for suspected DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion). The array is a single-color platform reporting the log base two ratio of normalized probe intensities relative to a diploid reference expectation, where a contiguous heterozygous deletion typically manifests as a segment with mean log base two ratio near $-0.5$ and two-copy regions near $0$. The 22q11.2 region contains canonical low-copy repeats (LCRs) labeled A through D that define common deletion breakpoints.\n\nAcross the 22q11.2 interval, segmentation identifies one contiguous region spanning probes from immediately distal to LCR-A to immediately proximal to LCR-D with mean log base two ratio $-0.50$. The boundary probes with their genomic coordinates (human genome reference build GRCh37) and segment means are:\n- Just distal to LCR-A, probe $P_{\\text{A, outside}}$ at coordinate $18{,}904{,}990$ has segment mean $0.01$.\n- Immediately inside LCR-A, probe $P_{\\text{A, inside}}$ at coordinate $18{,}906{,}432$ lies at the proximal edge of the $-0.50$ segment.\n- Immediately inside LCR-D, probe $P_{\\text{D, inside}}$ at coordinate $21{,}872{,}991$ lies at the distal edge of the $-0.50$ segment.\n- Just distal to LCR-D, probe $P_{\\text{D, outside}}$ at coordinate $21{,}875{,}120$ has segment mean $0.02$.\n\nUsing accepted definitions of CMA log base two ratio behavior for copy number states and interval estimation from boundary probes, derive the minimal deleted interval supported by the data and justify that the observed pattern indicates a heterozygous A–D deletion consistent with DiGeorge syndrome.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It accurately describes a standard clinical scenario in pediatric genetics, the principles of Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA), and the genetic basis of DiGeorge syndrome. All provided data are realistic and sufficient for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution involves two parts: justifying the diagnosis based on the provided data and calculating the minimal size of the genetic deletion.\n\n**Justification of the Diagnosis**\n\nThe patient, a $6$-month-old infant, presents with a classic triad of clinical features associated with DiGeorge syndrome: a conotruncal cardiac anomaly, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and hypocalcemia. This clinical presentation provides a strong a priori reason to suspect a deletion in the chromosome $22$q$11.2$ region.\n\nThe Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) was performed to test this hypothesis. CMA measures the amount of DNA at thousands of specific locations (probes) across the genome. The results are reported as a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of the patient's DNA amount relative to a standard diploid reference.\n- A normal diploid region has two copies of DNA, yielding an expected patient-to-reference ratio of $2/2 = 1$. The corresponding $\\log_{2}(1)$ is $0$.\n- A heterozygous deletion, where one of the two copies of a chromosomal segment is missing, results in a single copy. The expected ratio is $1/2 = 0.5$. The corresponding $\\log_{2}(0.5) = -1$. However, various normalization techniques and platform-specific behaviors in clinical arrays often shift this value. The problem explicitly states that for this platform, a heterozygous deletion manifests as a mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ near $-0.5$, which represents a significant deviation from the normal diploid state.\n\nThe CMA results for this patient identified a contiguous segment of probes on chromosome $22$ with a mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. This value is consistent with the platform's signature for a heterozygous deletion, indicating that the patient has only one copy of this specific genomic region instead of the normal two. The flanking regions show mean $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ values of $0.01$ and $0.02$, which are effectively $0$, confirming they are normal diploid regions.\n\nThe location of this deletion is critical. The deletion is found within the $22$q$11.2$ chromosomal band. Specifically, it is described as an A–D deletion, meaning it spans the region between Low-Copy Repeat A (LCR-A) and Low-Copy Repeat D (LCR-D). This is the most common (~$85$%) type of deletion responsible for DiGeorge syndrome. The breakpoints are mediated by non-allelic homologous recombination between these LCRs.\n\nTherefore, the CMA finding of a heterozygous deletion in the canonical $22$q$11.2$ A–D region provides a definitive molecular diagnosis that confirms the clinical suspicion of DiGeorge syndrome.\n\n**Calculation of the Minimal Deleted Interval**\n\nIn CMA, the true genomic breakpoints of a deletion lie in the unprobed region between the last probe showing a normal copy number and the first probe showing a deletion. The minimal size of a deletion is defined by the genomic interval between the first (most proximal) and last (most distal) probes that are determined to be within the deleted segment.\n\nFrom the provided data:\n- The proximal edge of the deleted segment is defined by probe $P_{\\text{A, inside}}$, which is the first probe with a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. Its genomic coordinate is $C_{\\text{start}} = 18,906,432$.\n- The distal edge of the deleted segment is defined by probe $P_{\\text{D, inside}}$, which is the last probe with a $\\log_{2}(\\text{ratio})$ of $-0.50$. Its genomic coordinate is $C_{\\text{end}} = 21,872,991$.\n\nThe minimal length of the deleted interval in base pairs (bp) is the difference between these two coordinates:\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{bp}} = C_{\\text{end}} - C_{\\text{start}} $$\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{bp}} = 21,872,991 - 18,906,432 = 2,966,559 \\, \\text{bp} $$\n\nTo express this length in megabases (Mb), we divide by $10^6$ bp/Mb:\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{Mb}} = \\frac{2,966,559}{10^6} = 2.966559 \\, \\text{Mb} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $9$, $6$, and $6$. The following digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the last significant digit.\n$$ \\text{Length}_{\\text{Mb}} \\approx 2.967 \\, \\text{Mb} $$\nThis size is approximately $3$ Mb, which is the expected size of a typical A–D deletion in the $22$q$11.2$ region, further substantiating the finding.",

Genetic testing is pending, but the phenotype raises concern for DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS)). In pediatric practice, the physiologically active fraction of calcium is the ionized component, while routine laboratory assays report total serum calcium, which is the sum of ionized and protein-bound fractions. The binding of calcium to albumin results in a proportional relationship between the albumin concentration and bound calcium. A widely used, empirically validated linear correction approach assumes that for each decrease of $1$ $\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$ in albumin from a reference of $4$ $\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$, the measured total calcium underestimates physiologically relevant calcium by $0.8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$.\n\nGiven a measured total calcium of $6.8$ $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$ and serum albumin of $2.5$ $\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$, compute the corrected total calcium using this linear albumin-binding adjustment.

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pediatric endocrinology and clinical chemistry, well-posed with all necessary data for a unique solution, and objective in its language.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the albumin-corrected total calcium concentration from a measured total calcium and a measured serum albumin level. A secondary task is to provide a brief clinical interpretation of this value.\n\nLet $Ca_{corr}$ represent the corrected total calcium concentration in $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$.\nLet $Ca_{meas}$ represent the measured total calcium concentration in $\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$.\nLet $Alb_{meas}$ represent the measured serum albumin concentration in $\\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\nLet $Alb_{ref}$ represent the reference serum albumin concentration, which is $4.0 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$.\nLet $k$ be the correction factor, given as $0.8 \\, (\\text{mg}/\\text{dL})$ of calcium for every $1 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$ of albumin deficit.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n-   $Ca_{meas} = 6.8 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$\n-   $Alb_{meas} = 2.5 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n-   $Alb_{ref} = 4.0 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$\n-   $k = 0.8 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}}{\\text{g}/\\text{dL}}$\n\nThe correction is necessary because a significant portion of calcium in the blood is bound to proteins, primarily albumin. In a state of hypoalbuminemia (low albumin), the total calcium measurement will be deceptively low because the protein-bound fraction is reduced, even if the physiologically active ionized calcium fraction is not as low. The correction formula empirically adjusts the total calcium value to what it would be if the albumin were at a normal reference level.\n\nThe problem states that for each decrease of $1 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$ in albumin from the reference of $4 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL}$, the measured total calcium underestimates the physiologically relevant calcium by $0.8 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$. This implies an additive correction.\n\nFirst, we calculate the albumin deficit, which is the difference between the reference albumin and the measured albumin:\n$$ \\Delta Alb = Alb_{ref} - Alb_{meas} $$\n\nThe total correction to be added to the measured calcium is the product of this deficit and the correction factor $k$:\n$$ \\text{Correction Amount} = k \\times \\Delta Alb = k \\times (Alb_{ref} - Alb_{meas}) $$\n\nThe corrected calcium concentration, $Ca_{corr}$, is the sum of the measured calcium and the correction amount:\n$$ Ca_{corr} = Ca_{meas} + k \\times (Alb_{ref} - Alb_{meas}) $$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the formula.\nThe albumin deficit is:\n$$ \\Delta Alb = 4.0 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL} - 2.5 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL} = 1.5 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL} $$\n\nThe correction amount is:\n$$ \\text{Correction Amount} = 0.8 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}/\\text{dL}}{\\text{g}/\\text{dL}} \\times 1.5 \\, \\text{g}/\\text{dL} = 1.2 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL} $$\n\nFinally, the corrected total calcium is calculated:\n$$ Ca_{corr} = 6.8 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL} + 1.2 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL} = 8.0 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL} $$\n\nThe problem specifies that the answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $8.0$. To express this with three significant figures, we write it as $8.00$.\n$$ Ca_{corr} = 8.00 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL} $$\n\nFor the clinical interpretation: A corrected total calcium of $8.00 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$ is at the lower limit of normal or mildly hypocalcemic for a neonate (a typical reference range is $8.5-10.5 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$). However, in the context of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11.2DS), which involves impaired parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, any degree of hypocalcemia is significant. The most crucial factor for determining the urgency of treatment is the presence of clinical symptoms. The patient's jitteriness is a sign of neuromuscular irritability (tetany), which indicates that the hypocalcemia is physiologically significant and affecting the central nervous system. Symptomatic hypocalcemia is a medical emergency, regardless of the precise calcium value, because it can progress to seizures, laryngospasm, and cardiac arrhythmias. Thus, the finding of a corrected calcium of $8.00 \\, \\text{mg}/\\text{dL}$ in a symptomatic neonate with suspected 22q11.2DS confirms the need for immediate treatment initiation with intravenous calcium.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It requires the application of fundamental principles of fluid dynamics to a clinically relevant scenario in pediatric cardiology, which is a standard and verifiable approach.\n\nThe solution begins with first principles from fluid dynamics, specifically the Bernoulli equation for an incompressible fluid along a streamline between two points: a proximal point before the stenosis (point $1$) and the point of maximum velocity within the stenosis (point $2$). The general form of the Bernoulli equation is:\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_1^2 + \\rho g h_1 = P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 + \\rho g h_2 $$\nHere, $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height. The fluid in question is blood.\n\nWe apply the simplifying assumptions provided in the problem statement:\n$1$. The flow is inviscid. The Bernoulli equation as stated assumes no energy loss due to viscous forces.\n$2$. The flow is steady. This allows us to apply the time-independent form of the equation.\n$3$. The height difference is negligible. For flow across the supravalvar aorta, the change in vertical height is minimal, so $h_1 \\approx h_2$. This allows us to cancel the potential energy terms, $\\rho g h_1$ and $\\rho g h_2$.\n$4$. The proximal velocity is negligible relative to the jet velocity. In a significant stenosis, the velocity in the wide chamber or vessel proximal to the narrowing ($v_1$) is much smaller than the peak velocity in the stenotic jet ($v_2$). We can therefore approximate $v_1 \\approx 0$.\n\nApplying assumptions $3$ and $4$, the Bernoulli equation simplifies considerably:\n$$ P_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (0)^2 \\approx P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\n$$ P_1 \\approx P_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v_2^2 $$\nThe instantaneous pressure gradient, $\\Delta P$, is the difference in pressure across the stenosis, $\\Delta P = P_1 - P_2$. Rearranging the simplified equation gives the expression for the pressure gradient in terms of the peak jet velocity, denoted as $v = v_2$:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_1 - P_2 \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 $$\nThis expression provides the pressure gradient in SI units (Pascals), given that $\\rho$ is in $\\text{kg/m}^3$ and $v$ is in $\\text{m/s}$.\n\nTo derive the clinically used simplified expression, where $\\Delta P$ is in millimeters of mercury ($\\text{mmHg}$) and $v$ is in $\\text{m/s}$, we must substitute the standard value for the density of blood and apply the appropriate unit conversion. The density of blood, $\\rho$, is approximately $1060 \\, \\text{kg/m}^3$. The conversion factor between Pascals ($\\text{Pa}$) and $\\text{mmHg}$ is approximately $1 \\, \\text{mmHg} \\approx 133.322 \\, \\text{Pa}$.\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta P \\, (\\text{mmHg}) \\approx \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} \\rho v^2}{133.322} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (1060) v^2}{133.322} = \\frac{530}{133.322} v^2 \\approx 3.975 v^2 $$\nFor clinical convenience, this coefficient is rounded to $4$. This rounding also empirically accounts for minor energy losses due to viscous friction and flow acceleration effects not captured by the steady-state Bernoulli equation. Thus, the physically justified and clinically standard simplified expression is:\n$$ \\Delta P \\approx 4v^2 $$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the peak instantaneous pressure gradient in $\\text{mmHg}$ and $v$ is the peak jet velocity in $\\text{m/s}$.\n\nNext, we compute the pressure gradient for the given peak jet velocity, $v = 3.5 \\, \\text{m/s}$:\n$$ \\Delta P = 4 \\times (3.5)^2 = 4 \\times 12.25 = 49 \\, \\text{mmHg} $$\nThe calculated peak instantaneous pressure gradient is $49 \\, \\text{mmHg}$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the severity and its clinical relevance. Established pediatric echocardiography guidelines for aortic outflow tract obstruction (including supravalvar aortic stenosis) classify severity based on the peak velocity or the peak instantaneous gradient:\n- Mild stenosis: Peak gradient $< 36 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $< 3.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n- Moderate stenosis: Peak gradient $36 - 64 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $3.0 - 4.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n- Severe stenosis: Peak gradient $> 64 \\, \\text{mmHg}$ (or peak velocity $> 4.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$)\n\nWith a measured peak velocity of $3.5 \\, \\text{m/s}$ and a calculated peak gradient of $49 \\, \\text{mmHg}$, the child's supravalvar aortic stenosis is classified as **moderate**.\n\nThe relevance of this finding in the context of Williams syndrome due to Elastin ($ELN$) gene deletion is profound. Williams syndrome is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome $7$ that includes the $ELN$ gene. This gene encodes tropoelastin, the monomer of elastin, a critical protein for the elasticity and integrity of arterial walls. Haploinsufficiency of $ELN$ leads to a deficiency of functional elastin, resulting in a systemic arteriopathy characterized by stiff, non-compliant blood vessels. This condition has a predilection for the ascending aorta, leading to narrowing just superior to the aortic valve, which is termed supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS). SVAS is the hallmark cardiovascular manifestation of Williams syndrome. The moderate obstruction quantified here imposes an increased afterload on the left ventricle, which must generate higher pressure to eject blood. Chronic pressure overload leads to concentric left ventricular hypertrophy, increased myocardial oxygen demand, and risk of subendocardial ischemia, arrhythmias, and eventual heart failure. Therefore, accurately quantifying the stenosis severity is paramount for risk stratification, guiding medical management, and determining the timing for surgical intervention to relieve the obstruction and prevent irreversible cardiac damage.",
