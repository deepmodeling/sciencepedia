A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe static compliance of the lung, $C_L$, is defined as the change in lung volume, $\\Delta V$, per unit change in the distending pressure across the lung. The distending pressure is the transpulmonary pressure, $P_L$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\nC_L = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_L}\n$$\nThe transpulmonary pressure, $P_L$, is the pressure difference between the alveoli ($P_{\\text{alv}}$) and the pleural space ($P_{\\text{pl}}$):\n$$\nP_L = P_{\\text{alv}} - P_{\\text{pl}}\n$$\nIn this problem, the esophageal pressure, $P_{\\text{es}}$, is used as a surrogate for pleural pressure, so we assume $P_{\\text{pl}} \\approx P_{\\text{es}}$. The change in transpulmonary pressure, $\\Delta P_L$, is the difference between its value at end-inspiration (EI) and end-expiration (EE):\n$$\n\\Delta P_L = P_{L, \\text{EI}} - P_{L, \\text{EE}}\n$$\nWe first calculate the transpulmonary pressure at each time point. The problem states that at the zero-flow holds, alveolar pressure equals airway pressure.\n\nAt end-inspiration (EI), the alveolar pressure is the airway plateau pressure, $P_{\\text{aw,plat,EI}}$. The transpulmonary pressure at end-inspiration is:\n$$\nP_{L, \\text{EI}} = P_{\\text{aw,plat,EI}} - P_{\\text{es,EI}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP_{L, \\text{EI}} = 25.0 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} - 13.2 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} = 11.8 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nAt end-expiration (EE), the alveolar pressure is the positive end-expiratory pressure, $P_{\\text{aw,EE}}$. The transpulmonary pressure at end-expiration is:\n$$\nP_{L, \\text{EE}} = P_{\\text{aw,EE}} - P_{\\text{es,EE}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nP_{L, \\text{EE}} = 7.0 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} - 5.4 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} = 1.6 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the change in transpulmonary pressure, $\\Delta P_L$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_L = P_{L, \\text{EI}} - P_{L, \\text{EE}} = 11.8 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} - 1.6 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} = 10.2 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThe tidal volume change, $\\Delta V$, is given as $6.63$ mL. We now compute the static lung compliance, $C_L$:\n$$\nC_L = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_L} = \\frac{6.63 \\text{ mL}}{10.2 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O}}\n$$\nThe calculation yields:\n$$\nC_L = 0.65 \\text{ mL/cm H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Since the result of the division is exactly $0.65$, we express this to three significant figures by adding a trailing zero.\n$$\nC_L = 0.650 \\text{ mL/cm H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of this value. Normal lung compliance for a healthy preterm infant is approximately $1.0$ to $1.5$ mL/cm H$_2$O per kg of body weight. For this $1.00$ kg infant, a normal value would be in the range of $1.0 - 1.5$ mL/cm H$_2$O. The calculated value of $0.650$ mL/cm H$_2$O is significantly **decreased**. This is a hallmark pathophysiological feature of established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Mechanistically, BPD is characterized by lung injury followed by abnormal repair, leading to structural changes including interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and pulmonary edema. These processes increase the elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma, making the lungs \"stiff\" and less distensible. A lower volume change is therefore achieved for a given change in distending pressure, which is reflected as a decreased static lung compliance.",

            "problem": "A preterm infant with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is mechanically ventilated using pressure-limited ventilation that applies a square-wave inspiratory airway pressure above a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). To reflect the heterogeneity of chronic lung disease of prematurity, model the lung as two parallel compartments with linear resistance and compliance.

Assume inertance is negligible and each compartment behaves as a first-order linear resistive-compliance element driven by the airway pressure.\n\nStarting from conservation of mass for gas in the compartment and the definitions of linear resistance and compliance, derive the time dependence of the compartmental volume during inspiratory pressurization (constant airway pressure above PEEP) and during expiratory return to PEEP. Using this derivation, determine the minimal inspiratory time $T_{I}$ and expiratory time $T_{E}$ such that, for both compartments:\n- inspiration achieves at least $0.90$ of each compartment’s steady-state volume under the applied inspiratory pressure, and\n- expiration leaves no more than $0.01$ of the end-inspiratory volume above the PEEP-defined baseline.\n\nChoose the single pair of settings $(T_{I}, T_{E})$ that satisfies both constraints simultaneously for the two-compartment lung. Express $T_{I}$ and $T_{E}$ in seconds. Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The infant lung compartments are modeled as linear resistive-compliance elements. For each compartment, let $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t)$ denote airway pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{A}}(t)$ alveolar pressure, $R$ resistance, $C$ compliance, and $V(t)$ the compartmental volume above the PEEP-defined baseline. Conservation of mass gives flow as the time derivative of volume, so $Q(t) = \\frac{dV}{dt}$. The resistive relation is $Q(t) = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{A}}(t)}{R}$. The compliance relation is $V(t) = C \\left(P_{\\mathrm{A}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{EEP}}\\right)$, where $P_{\\mathrm{EEP}}$ is the positive end-expiratory pressure baseline. Eliminating $P_{\\mathrm{A}}(t)$ via $P_{\\mathrm{A}}(t) = \\frac{V(t)}{C} + P_{\\mathrm{EEP}}$ yields the linear ordinary differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{EEP}}}{R} - \\frac{V(t)}{R C}.\n$$\nDefine the time constant $\\tau = R \\times C$. During the inspiratory phase, the ventilator applies a constant airway pressure step such that $P_{\\mathrm{aw}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{EEP}} = \\Delta P$ (a constant).

Calculation of the New Alveolar–Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($(A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}$)**\nThe change in MAP is $\\Delta MAP = MAP_{\\mathrm{new}} - MAP_{\\mathrm{old}}$.\n$$\\Delta MAP = 10.2 - 8.4 = 1.8 \\text{ cm H}_{2}\\text{O}$$\nThe problem states that the A–a gradient decreases by $k = 8$ mm Hg for each $1$ cm H$_2$O increase in MAP. The total change in the gradient is:\n$$\\Delta (A\\text{–}a)O_2 = -k \\times \\Delta MAP = -8 \\text{ mm Hg/cm H}_2\\text{O} \\times 1.8 \\text{ cm H}_2\\text{O} = -14.4 \\text{ mm Hg}$$\nThe new gradient is the old gradient plus this change:\n$$(A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{new}} = (A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{old}} + \\Delta (A\\text{–}a)O_2$$\n$$(A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{new}} = 140 \\text{ mm Hg} - 14.4 \\text{ mm Hg} = 125.6 \\text{ mm Hg}$$\n\n**4. Prediction of the New Arterial Oxygen Partial Pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}}$)**\nThe definition of the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient is $(A\\text{–}a)O_2 = P_{\\mathrm{A}O_{2}} - P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2}}$.\nRearranging for arterial oxygen partial pressure gives $P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2}} = P_{\\mathrm{A}O_{2}} - (A\\text{–}a)O_2$.\nUsing the calculated values for $P_{\\mathrm{A}O_{2}}$ and $(A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}} = P_{\\mathrm{A}O_{2}} - (A\\text{–}a)O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}} = 216.45 \\text{ mm Hg} - 125.6 \\text{ mm Hg} = 90.85 \\text{ mm Hg}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{a}O_{2,\\mathrm{new}}} \\approx 90.9 \\text{ mm Hg}$$",
