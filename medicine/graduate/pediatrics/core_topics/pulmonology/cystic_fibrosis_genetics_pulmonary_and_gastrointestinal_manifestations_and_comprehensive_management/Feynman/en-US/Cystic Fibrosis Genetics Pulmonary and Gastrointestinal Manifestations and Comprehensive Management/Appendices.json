This first practice focuses on a common clinical scenario: interpreting the results of genetic testing for a potential CF carrier . You will apply the principles of conditional probability to calculate how a negative test result modifies a person's initial carrier risk, a crucial skill for providing accurate counseling to prospective parents and illustrating that \"negative\" does not always mean \"zero risk.\"",

            "problem": "A pediatric genetics clinic is counseling a couple in which one partner is a confirmed heterozygous carrier for cystic fibrosis (CF). The other partner is of an ancestry in which the CF carrier frequency is $1/25$. That partner undergoes a targeted CF mutation panel that, in this ancestry, has analytic sensitivity $0.90$ for identifying carriers of CF-causing variants and analytic specificity that can be considered approximately $1.00$ for the purpose of decision-making. The partner’s panel result is negative.\n\nUsing the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and conditional probability, and without invoking any unprovided shortcut formulas, determine the posterior probability that the partner remains a CF carrier after this negative test result. Express your final answer as a decimal number and round to four significant figures. Do not use a percent sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information to determine the posterior probability. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $C$: The event that the partner is a carrier for cystic fibrosis.\n- $N$: The event that the partner is not a carrier for cystic fibrosis.\n- $T^-$: The event that the partner's mutation panel result is negative.\n- $T^+$: The event that the partner's mutation panel result is positive.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The prior probability that the partner is a carrier, based on their ancestry's carrier frequency, is $P(C) = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$.\n2.  The prior probability that the partner is not a carrier is therefore $P(N) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - \\frac{1}{25} = \\frac{24}{25} = 0.96$.\n3.  The analytic sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the person is a carrier: $P(T^+|C) = 0.90$.\n4.  The analytic specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the person is not a carrier. The problem states this can be approximated as $1.00$, so we take $P(T^-|N) = 1.00$.\n\nOur objective is to calculate the posterior probability that the partner is a carrier given that their test result was negative. This is the conditional probability $P(C|T^-)$.\n\nAccording to the fundamental definition of conditional probability, we have:\n$$P(C|T^-) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)}$$\nwhere $P(C \\cap T^-)$ is the joint probability of the partner being a carrier and testing negative, and $P(T^-)$ is the total probability of testing negative.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $P(C \\cap T^-)$. This can be found using the multiplication rule for conditional probability, $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$.\n$$P(C \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|C)P(C)$$\nWe need to find $P(T^-|C)$, which is the probability of a negative test given the partner is a carrier. This is also known as the false negative rate. Since a carrier must test either positive or negative, the sum of the probabilities of these two outcomes is $1$.\n$$P(T^+|C) + P(T^-|C) = 1$$\nTherefore,\n$$P(T^-|C) = 1 - P(T^+|C) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nNow we can compute the numerator:\n$$P(C \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|C)P(C) = 0.10 \\times 0.04 = 0.004$$\n\nNext, we calculate the denominator, $P(T^-)$, which is the total probability of a negative test. A person can test negative in two mutually exclusive ways: (1) they are a carrier and test negative ($C \\cap T^-$), or (2) they are not a carrier and test negative ($N \\cap T^-$). By the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(C \\cap T^-) + P(N \\cap T^-)$$\nWe have already calculated $P(C \\cap T^-) = 0.004$. We now calculate $P(N \\cap T^-)$ using the multiplication rule:\n$$P(N \\cap T^-) = P(T^-|N)P(N)$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$P(N \\cap T^-) = 1.00 \\times 0.96 = 0.96$$\nNow we can sum the probabilities to find the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = 0.004 + 0.96 = 0.964$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerator and denominator back into the formula for $P(C|T^-)$:\n$$P(C|T^-) = \\frac{P(C \\cap T^-)}{P(T^-)} = \\frac{0.004}{0.964}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$P(C|T^-) \\approx 0.00414937759...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $4$, $1$, $4$, and $9$. The subsequent digit is $3$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., keep the last significant digit as is).\n$$P(C|T^-) \\approx 0.004149$$",

Effective management relies on Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT), which must be dosed precisely to be both effective and safe . This exercise challenges you to construct a PERT regimen by balancing two distinct safety ceilings—one based on body weight and the other on dietary fat intake—reflecting the real-world calculations clinicians perform to optimize nutrition while minimizing the risk of complications.",

            "problem": "A child with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) and documented exocrine pancreatic insufficiency requires Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT) to optimize fat absorption and prevent malnutrition and steatorrhea while avoiding excessive dosing that increases the risk of fibrosing colonopathy. In evidence-based pediatric CF management, per-meal lipase dosing is bounded by two well-tested safety ceilings: a body mass ceiling and a dietary fat ceiling. Let the child's body mass be $m$ (in $\\mathrm{kg}$), the fat content of a single meal be $F$ (in $\\mathrm{g}$), and the per-meal lipase dose be $U$ (in lipase units). The safety ceilings are the body-mass ceiling $u_{\\mathrm{kg}}$ (in $\\mathrm{units\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot meal^{-1}}$) and the dietary-fat ceiling $u_{\\mathrm{fat}}$ (in $\\mathrm{units\\cdot g^{-1}}$), so that any safe dose must satisfy $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{kg}}\\, m$ and $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{fat}}\\, F$. Capsules have a fixed lipase content $U_{c}$ (in units per capsule), and the administered capsule count $n$ must be an integer such that $n\\, U_{c} \\leq U_{\\max}$, where $U_{\\max}$ is the maximal allowable lipase dose per meal under both ceilings.\n\nConstruct a per-meal PERT regimen for a child with $m = 20\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ consuming $F = 30\\ \\mathrm{g}$ of fat per meal, using dosing ceilings $u_{\\mathrm{kg}} = 2500\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot meal^{-1}}$ and $u_{\\mathrm{fat}} = 4000\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot g^{-1}}$.

Express your final answer as the integer number of capsules per meal. No rounding is required. Do not include any units in your final boxed answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The givens are extracted verbatim: child's body mass $m = 20\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, meal's fat content $F = 30\\ \\mathrm{g}$, body-mass dosing ceiling $u_{\\mathrm{kg}} = 2500\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot meal^{-1}}$, dietary-fat dosing ceiling $u_{\\mathrm{fat}} = 4000\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot g^{-1}}$, and capsule lipase content $U_{c} = 25000\\ \\mathrm{units/capsule}$. The problem requires finding the largest integer number of capsules, $n$, that can be safely administered. The problem's premises are consistent with established pediatric guidelines for Pancreatic Enzyme Replacement Therapy (PERT) in cystic fibrosis, making it scientifically sound and relevant. All necessary data are provided, the constraints are clear, and the objective is unambiguous. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the maximal allowable per-meal lipase dose, $U_{\\max}$, by adhering to two independent safety constraints. A safe dose, $U$, must satisfy both the body-mass-based ceiling and the dietary-fat-based ceiling. These constraints are expressed as two inequalities:\n$1.$ The dose must not exceed the limit based on the child's mass: $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m$.\n$2.$ The dose must not exceed the limit based on the meal's fat content: $U \\leq u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F$.\n\nTo satisfy both conditions simultaneously, the dose $U$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of these two upper bounds. The maximal allowable dose, $U_{\\max}$, is therefore the lesser of the two calculated ceilings. This can be expressed formally as:\n$$U_{\\max} = \\min(u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m, u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F)$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the maximum dose allowed by the body-mass ceiling. Let's denote this limit as $U_{\\text{limit, kg}}$.\n$$U_{\\text{limit, kg}} = u_{\\mathrm{kg}} \\cdot m$$\nSubstituting the given values, $u_{\\mathrm{kg}} = 2500\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot kg^{-1}\\cdot meal^{-1}}$ and $m = 20\\ \\mathrm{kg}$:\n$$U_{\\text{limit, kg}} = 2500 \\cdot 20 = 50000\\ \\mathrm{units}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the maximum dose allowed by the dietary-fat ceiling. Let's denote this limit as $U_{\\text{limit, fat}}$.\n$$U_{\\text{limit, fat}} = u_{\\mathrm{fat}} \\cdot F$$\nSubstituting the given values, $u_{\\mathrm{fat}} = 4000\\ \\mathrm{units\\cdot g^{-1}}$ and $F = 30\\ \\mathrm{g}$:\n$$U_{\\text{limit, fat}} = 4000 \\cdot 30 = 120000\\ \\mathrm{units}$$\n\nNow, we determine $U_{\\max}$ by taking the minimum of these two values. The body-mass ceiling is more restrictive in this case.\n$$U_{\\max} = \\min(U_{\\text{limit, kg}}, U_{\\text{limit, fat}}) = \\min(50000, 120000) = 50000\\ \\mathrm{units}$$\n\nThe final step is to determine the number of capsules, $n$, that can be administered. Since capsules cannot be divided, $n$ must be an integer. The total lipase dose from $n$ capsules is $n \\cdot U_c$, where $U_c$ is the lipase content per capsule. This total dose must not exceed the maximal allowable dose, $U_{\\max}$.\n$$n \\cdot U_c \\leq U_{\\max}$$\n\nWe need to find the largest integer $n$ that satisfies this inequality. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $n$:\n$$n \\leq \\frac{U_{\\max}}{U_c}$$\nSubstituting the calculated value for $U_{\\max}$ and the given value for $U_c = 25000\\ \\mathrm{units/capsule}$:\n$$n \\leq \\frac{50000}{25000}$$\n$$n \\leq 2$$\n\nThe problem asks for the largest integer $n$ that satisfies this condition. The largest integer less than or equal to $2$ is $2$. Therefore, the maximal number of capsules that can be administered per meal is $2$.",

Over the last three days, the clinically measured total daily insulin dose (Total Daily Dose, TDD) has stabilized at $42$ International Units (IU) per day. The patient has consistent carbohydrate intake of $60$ grams per meal and is on adequate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, with stable stool patterns and weight, suggesting reliable gastrointestinal absorption.

It presents a standard clinical calculation scenario in pediatric diabetology, specifically for a patient with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or violations of established medical or physical principles. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying established empirical rules for insulin dosing, as requested by the prompt to start from \"clinically established, well-validated relationships.\" For a patient using a rapid-acting insulin analog, these are the \"Rule of $500$\" to estimate the insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio ($ICR$) and the \"Rule of $1800$\" to estimate the insulin sensitivity factor ($ISF$). These rules relate the patient's total daily dose (TDD) of insulin to these key parameters.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Total Daily Dose ($TDD$) = $42$ International Units (IU)\n- Carbohydrate intake per meal ($C_{meal}$) = $60$ grams (g)\n- Target preprandial glucose ($G_{target}$) = $120$ milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL)\n- Pre-breakfast glucose ($G_{b-fast}$) = $248$ mg/dL\n- Pre-lunch glucose ($G_{lunch}$) = $184$ mg/dL\n- Pre-dinner glucose ($G_{dinner}$) = $302$ mg/dL\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient-specific insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio ($ICR$). The $ICR$ represents the number of grams of carbohydrate covered by one unit of rapid-acting insulin. It is derived using the \"Rule of $500$\":\n$$ICR \\text{ (in g/IU)} = \\frac{500}{TDD \\text{ (in IU)}}$$\nSubstituting the given $TDD$:\n$$ICR = \\frac{500}{42} \\approx 11.90476 \\, \\text{g/IU}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $ICR = 11.9$ g/IU.\n\nSecond, we calculate the insulin sensitivity factor ($ISF$), also known as the correction factor. The $ISF$ represents the magnitude, in mg/dL, by which blood glucose is expected to drop in response to one unit of rapid-acting insulin. It is derived using the \"Rule of $1800$\":\n$$ISF \\text{ (in mg/dL/IU)} = \\frac{1800}{TDD \\text{ (in IU)}}$$\nSubstituting the given $TDD$:\n$$ISF = \\frac{1800}{42} \\approx 42.85714 \\, \\text{mg/dL/IU}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $ISF = 42.9$ mg/dL/IU.\n\nThird, we compute the carbohydrate coverage bolus ($D_{carb}$) required for a meal containing $60$ grams of carbohydrates.
