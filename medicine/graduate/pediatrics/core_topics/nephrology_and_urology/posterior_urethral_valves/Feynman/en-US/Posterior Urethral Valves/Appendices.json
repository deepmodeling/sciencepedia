It is a well-defined, scientifically grounded problem that can be solved using the provided information and first principles. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis is based on Poiseuille's law, which describes the relationship between volumetric flow rate $Q$, radius $r$, pressure drop $\\Delta P$, fluid viscosity $\\eta$, and tube length $L$.\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nThis relationship can be expressed for the unobstructed state (State $0$) and the obstructed state (State $1$).\n\nFor State $0$:\n$$Q_0 = \\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nFor State $1$:\n$$Q_1 = \\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nThe problem states that the viscosity $\\eta$ and length $L$ are constant for both states. We can analyze the proportionality of the variables by isolating the constants.\nLet $k = \\frac{\\pi}{8 \\eta L}$. Then the law simplifies to $Q = k r^4 \\Delta P$.\n\n#### Part 1: Derive the ratio $Q_1/Q_0$ for a constant pressure drop $\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_0$\n\nWe form the ratio of $Q_1$ to $Q_0$:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_0^4 \\Delta P_0}{8 \\eta L}} $$\nThe constants $\\pi$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nThe condition for this part is that the pressure drop remains unchanged, so $\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_0$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4}{r_0^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_0}\\right)^4 $$\nWe are given that $r_1 = 0.8 \\, r_0$. Substituting this relationship:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{0.8 \\, r_0}{r_0}\\right)^4 = (0.8)^4 $$\nTo express this as an exact rational number, we convert the decimal $0.8$ to a fraction: $0.8 = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$.\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4^4}{5^4} = \\frac{256}{625} $$\nThis result shows that an $80\\%$ radius results in a flow rate of only about $41\\%$ of the original, demonstrating the critical dependence of flow on radius.\n\n#### Part 2: Derive the ratio $\\Delta P_1/\\Delta P_0$ required to maintain constant flow $Q_1 = Q_0$\n\nWe begin again with the general ratio:\n$$ \\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nThe condition for this part is that the flow rate is maintained, so $Q_1 = Q_0$, which means $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = 1$.\n$$ 1 = \\frac{r_1^4 \\Delta P_1}{r_0^4 \\Delta P_0} $$\nWe need to find the ratio $\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{r_0^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{r_1}\\right)^4 $$\nAgain, we substitute the given relationship $r_1 = 0.8 \\, r_0 = \\frac{4}{5} \\, r_0$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\left(\\frac{r_0}{\\frac{4}{5} \\, r_0}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{5}}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^4 $$\nCalculating the value of the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{5^4}{4^4} = \\frac{625}{256} $$\nThis result indicates that to overcome the narrowed urethra and maintain the original flow rate, the detrusor muscle must generate a pressure that is $\\frac{625}{256} \\approx 2.44$ times higher than normal. This increased workload on the bladder is a key pathophysiological consequence of obstructive uropathy.\n\nThe two derived ratios are $\\frac{Q_1}{Q_0} = \\frac{256}{625}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta P_1}{\\Delta P_0} = \\frac{625}{256}$. The final answer is to be presented as a row matrix.",

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary data for a unique and meaningful solution. We will proceed by first deriving the formula for the fractional excretion of sodium ($Fe_{Na}$), then calculating its value, and finally providing a clinical interpretation based on established neonatal criteria.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $Fe_{Na}$. The fractional excretion of sodium is defined conceptually as the fraction of the sodium load filtered by the glomeruli that is ultimately excreted in the urine. This can be expressed as a ratio:\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{\\text{Rate of sodium excretion}}{\\text{Rate of sodium filtration}}\n$$\nThe rate of excretion of any substance is its concentration in the urine multiplied by the urine flow rate. Let $U_{Na}$ be the urine sodium concentration and $V$ be the urine flow rate (volume per unit time). The rate of sodium excretion is therefore $U_{Na} \\times V$.\n\nThe rate of filtration of any substance that is freely filtered at the glomerulus is its concentration in the plasma multiplied by the glomerular filtration rate ($GFR$). Let $P_{Na}$ be the plasma sodium concentration. The rate of sodium filtration is therefore $P_{Na} \\times GFR$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition gives:\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times GFR}\n$$\nThis expression contains two variables, $V$ and $GFR$, which are often difficult to measure directly. To create a more practical formula, we use an endogenous filtration marker, which the problem specifies as creatinine. An ideal filtration marker is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules. Under this assumption, the amount of the marker filtered per unit time equals the amount excreted per unit time. For creatinine ($Cr$):\n$$\n\\text{Rate of creatinine filtration} = \\text{Rate of creatinine excretion}\n$$\nUsing the same logic as for sodium, we can write this as:\n$$\nP_{Cr} \\times GFR = U_{Cr} \\times V\n$$\nwhere $P_{Cr}$ is the plasma creatinine concentration and $U_{Cr}$ is the urine creatinine concentration.\n\nThis equation allows us to express the $GFR$ in terms of measurable concentrations and the urine flow rate $V$:\n$$\nGFR = \\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $GFR$ back into our equation for $Fe_{Na}$:\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na} \\times V}{P_{Na} \\times \\left(\\frac{U_{Cr} \\times V}{P_{Cr}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe urine flow rate, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, so it can be canceled out. Rearranging the terms yields the final, standard formula for calculating the fractional excretion of sodium from simultaneous urine and plasma samples:\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{U_{Na}}{P_{Na}} \\times \\frac{P_{Cr}}{U_{Cr}}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the four provided laboratory measurements.\n\nSecond, we compute the value of $Fe_{Na}$ using the given data:\n- Urine sodium $U_{Na} = 62 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- Plasma sodium $P_{Na} = 136 \\text{ mEq/L}$\n- Urine creatinine $U_{Cr} = 24 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n- Plasma creatinine $P_{Cr} = 2.1 \\text{ mg/dL}$\n\nPlugging these values into the derived formula:\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{62}{136} \\times \\frac{2.1}{24}\n$$\nIt is important to note that the units for sodium concentration (mEq/L) and creatinine concentration (mg/dL) cancel out within their respective ratios, rendering the final $Fe_{Na}$ value dimensionless, as required.\n$$\nFe_{Na} = \\frac{130.2}{3264} \\approx 0.03988970588...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nFe_{Na} \\approx 0.0399\n$$\n\nThird, we interpret this result in the clinical context of a term neonate with decompressed posterior urethral valves, who is not receiving diuretics. The $Fe_{Na}$ is used to differentiate between prerenal azotemia (kidneys are responding to a state of low effective circulatory volume) and intrinsic renal injury (kidneys are damaged and cannot function properly). In prerenal states, the tubules are intact and avidly reabsorb sodium to conserve volume, leading to a low $Fe_{Na}$. In intrinsic renal injury, particularly acute tubular necrosis (ATN), damaged tubules cannot reabsorb sodium effectively, leading to sodium wasting and a high $Fe_{Na}$.\n\nIn term neonates, who have physiologically immature tubular function compared to older children and adults, the conventional decimal threshold for suspecting intrinsic renal injury is lower than in adults but higher than one might expect. An $Fe_{Na}$ value greater than approximately $0.025$ to $0.03$ (i.e., $2.5\\%$ to $3\\%$) is highly suggestive of intrinsic renal injury. A value less than $0.02$ ($2\\%$) would be more consistent with a prerenal state. Our calculated value of $Fe_{Na} \\approx 0.0399$ is significantly above the $0.025 - 0.03$ threshold. Therefore, the result supports the conclusion that the azotemia reflects intrinsic renal tubular injury, likely secondary to the prolonged bladder outlet obstruction from the posterior urethral valves, rather than a simple prerenal state.",

A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds by first defining the relevant physiological quantities, then identifying the correct data segment for analysis, and finally performing the required calculations.\n\nThe fundamental relationship in multichannel cystometry for assessing bladder muscle function is the calculation of detrusor pressure, $P_{\\text{det}}$. The detrusor pressure represents the pressure generated by the bladder wall itself, and it is calculated by subtracting the abdominal pressure, $P_{\\text{abd}}$, from the vesical pressure, $P_{\\text{ves}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{det}} = P_{\\text{ves}} - P_{\\text{abd}}$$\nBladder compliance, $C$, is a measure of the bladder's ability to store urine at low pressure. It is defined as the change in bladder volume, $\\Delta V$, divided by the corresponding change in detrusor pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}$, over a specified interval of filling.\n$$C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}}$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of compliance over the \"longest contiguous quasi-static filling segment prior to detrusor overactivity.\" The provided data indicates that the study begins at a volume $V = 20\\,\\text{mL}$ and that detrusor overactivity, which marks the end of the quasi-static phase, begins at $V = 160\\,\\text{mL}$. Therefore, the segment for analysis spans from the initial volume measurement up to the last measurement taken before the overactivity event.\n\nThe start point of this segment is the first data point:\n- At $V_1 = 20\\,\\text{mL}$, we have $P_{\\text{ves,1}} = 12\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $P_{\\text{abd,1}} = 5\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nThe end point of the quasi-static segment is the last measurement before the detrusor overactivity at $V = 160\\,\\text{mL}$. This corresponds to the data point at $V = 140\\,\\text{mL}$:\n- At $V_2 = 140\\,\\text{mL}$, we have $P_{\\text{ves,2}} = 40\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$ and $P_{\\text{abd,2}} = 10\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nThe data point recorded during the cough at $V = 80\\,\\text{mL}$ is an artifact representing a transient, non-storage-related pressure spike and must be excluded from the compliance calculation. The stable post-artifact reading at $V = 80\\,\\text{mL}$ is part of the quasi-static curve but is not an endpoint for the overall segment calculation.\n\nFirst, we calculate the detrusor pressure at the start and end points of the identified segment.\nAt the start of the segment ($V_1 = 20\\,\\text{mL}$):\n$$P_{\\text{det,1}} = P_{\\text{ves,1}} - P_{\\text{abd,1}} = 12\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} - 5\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} = 7\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$$\nAt the end of the segment ($V_2 = 140\\,\\text{mL}$):\n$$P_{\\text{det,2}} = P_{\\text{ves,2}} - P_{\\text{abd,2}} = 40\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} - 10\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} = 30\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$$\nNext, we calculate the change in volume ($\\Delta V$) and the change in detrusor pressure ($\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}$) over this segment.\n$$\\Delta V = V_2 - V_1 = 140\\,\\text{mL} - 20\\,\\text{mL} = 120\\,\\text{mL}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{det}} = P_{\\text{det,2}} - P_{\\text{det,1}} = 30\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} - 7\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O} = 23\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$$\nNow, we can compute the bladder compliance, $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta P_{\\text{det}}} = \\frac{120\\,\\text{mL}}{23\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}}$$\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$C \\approx 5.2173913...\\,\\text{mL}/\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C = 5.217\\,\\text{mL}/\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$$\nThe clinical threshold for low compliance is given as less than $10\\,\\text{mL}/\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$.
