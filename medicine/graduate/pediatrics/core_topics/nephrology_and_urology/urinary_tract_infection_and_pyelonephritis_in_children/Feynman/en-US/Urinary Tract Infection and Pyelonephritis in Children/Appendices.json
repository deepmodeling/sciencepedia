            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following data and principles for evaluating a febrile infant aged $2$–$24$ months for a urinary tract infection (UTI):\n-   **Baseline pretest probability of UTI:** $p_0 = 0.05$.\n-   **Likelihood Ratios (LRs) for clinical indicators (assuming conditional independence):**\n    -   Sex and circumcision status (mutually exclusive):\n        -   Female: $\\mathrm{LR} = 2.0$\n        -   Male uncircumcised: $\\mathrm{LR} = 3.5$\n        -   Male circumcised: $\\mathrm{LR} = 0.3$\n    -   Age category:\n        -   Age $<12$ months: $\\mathrm{LR} = 1.4$\n        -   Age $12$–$24$ months: $\\mathrm{LR} = 0.7$\n    -   Prior UTI:\n        -   Present: $\\mathrm{LR} = 3.0$\n        -   Absent: No additional factor (equivalent to $\\mathrm{LR} = 1.0$)\n    -   Clinical appearance:\n        -   Ill-appearing: $\\mathrm{LR} = 2.0$\n        -   Well-appearing: No additional factor (equivalent to $\\mathrm{LR} = 1.0$)\n-   **Action threshold for urine testing:** Test if the estimated UTI probability, $p_{\\text{est}}$, is greater than or equal to $p_T = 0.02$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in standard principles of clinical epidemiology and evidence-based medicine. It uses pretest probability, likelihood ratios, and a testing threshold, which are fundamental tools for diagnostic decision-making. The values provided are stated to be from meta-analyses, a valid source of evidence. The clinical scenario is realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all the necessary quantitative data ($p_0$, all relevant LRs, and $p_T$) and a clear objective (find the decision rule most consistent with these data and principles). The assumption of conditional independence is explicitly stated, removing ambiguity in how to combine LRs. A unique and meaningful evaluation of the options is possible.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. It is free from subjective language or opinion.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution will proceed by deriving the correct methodology and using it to evaluate each option.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe underlying principle is the use of Bayesian reasoning to update a prior probability based on new evidence (clinical indicators). The evidence is quantified by likelihood ratios (LRs).\n\n1.  **Convert Pretest Probability to Pretest Odds:**\n    The pretest probability is $p_0 = 0.05$. The corresponding pretest odds are:\n    $$ \\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0} = \\frac{0.05}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{0.05}{0.95} = \\frac{1}{19} $$\n\n2.  **Combine Likelihood Ratios:**\n    Due to the stated assumption of conditional independence, the combined likelihood ratio for a patient with a specific set of indicators is the product of the individual LRs:\n    $$ \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{sex/circ}} \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age}} \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{prior UTI}} \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{appearance}} $$\n\n3.  **Calculate Post-test Odds:**\n    The post-test odds (representing the updated odds of UTI) are calculated by multiplying the pre-test odds by the combined LR:\n    $$ \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_0 \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} $$\n\n4.  **Convert Post-test Odds to Post-test Probability:**\n    The post-test odds are converted back to a probability, which is the estimated risk for the patient, $p_{\\text{est}}$:\n    $$ p_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}} $$\n\n5.  **Apply the Decision Threshold:**\n    A urine specimen should be obtained if the estimated probability meets or exceeds the action threshold:\n    $$ \\text{Test if } p_{\\text{est}} \\ge p_T = 0.02 $$\n\nAlternatively, we can find the threshold LR. The odds corresponding to the probability threshold $p_T = 0.02$ are $\\text{Odds}_T = \\frac{0.02}{1-0.02} = \\frac{0.02}{0.98} = \\frac{1}{49}$. The decision rule is to test if $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} \\ge \\text{Odds}_T$, which means:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_0 \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} \\ge \\text{Odds}_T $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{19} \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} \\ge \\frac{1}{49} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} \\ge \\frac{19}{49} \\approx 0.3878 $$\nSo, we test if the combined likelihood ratio is approximately $0.39$ or greater.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n### Option A\n**Statement:** Use a multiplicative likelihood ratio approach from the baseline $p_0$ to estimate each child’s UTI probability; test if the estimated probability is $\\ge p_T$. With this rule, a well-appearing $9$-month-old female with no prior UTI should be tested, whereas a well-appearing circumcised $18$-month-old male with no prior UTI should not be tested.\n\n**Analysis:** This option first states the correct methodology, which matches our derived principle. We must now verify the two specific examples provided.\n\n1.  **Patient 1:** Well-appearing, $9$-month-old female, no prior UTI.\n    -   LRs: $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{female}} = 2.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age }<12} = 1.4$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{no prior}} = 1.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{well}} = 1.0$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = 2.0 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.0 \\times 1.0 = 2.8$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_0 \\times \\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 2.8 = \\frac{2.8}{19}$.\n    -   $p_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{2.8/19}{1 + 2.8/19} = \\frac{2.8}{19 + 2.8} = \\frac{2.8}{21.8} \\approx 0.1284$.\n    -   Decision: $0.1284 > 0.02$. The patient should be tested. The claim is correct.\n\n2.  **Patient 2:** Well-appearing, circumcised $18$-month-old male, no prior UTI.\n    -   LRs: $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{male circ}} = 0.3$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age }12-24} = 0.7$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{no prior}} = 1.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{well}} = 1.0$.\n    -   $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = 0.3 \\times 0.7 \\times 1.0 \\times 1.0 = 0.21$.\n    -   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 0.21 = \\frac{0.21}{19}$.\n    -   $p_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{0.21/19}{1 + 0.21/19} = \\frac{0.21}{19 + 0.21} = \\frac{0.21}{19.21} \\approx 0.0109$.\n    -   Decision: $0.0109 < 0.02$. The patient should not be tested. The claim is correct.\n\nBoth the method and the examples in this option are consistent with the principles and data.\n\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n### Option B\n**Statement:** Test any female $<12$ months, any uncircumcised male of any age, or any child with prior UTI; defer urine testing in all other children regardless of appearance.\n\n**Analysis:** This is a simplified categorical rule. It notably states to make decisions \"regardless of appearance,\" which contradicts the given data that being ill-appearing is a significant risk factor ($\\mathrm{LR} = 2.0$). Let's find a case where this rule fails. According to the rule, \"all other children\" are not tested. Consider a patient who does not meet the \"test\" criteria: a female child, age $18$ months ($ \\ge 12$ months), with no prior UTI. Rule B would defer testing. However, if this child is ill-appearing:\n-   LRs: $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{female}} = 2.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age }12-24} = 0.7$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{no prior}} = 1.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{ill}} = 2.0$.\n-   $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = 2.0 \\times 0.7 \\times 1.0 \\times 2.0 = 2.8$.\n-   Calculation for $p_{\\text{est}}$ with $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}}=2.8$ was done for Patient 1 in Option A, yielding $p_{\\text{est}} \\approx 0.1284$.\n-   Decision: $0.1284 > 0.02$. The formal model indicates this child should be tested. Rule B indicates she should not.\n\nBecause Rule B leads to a decision that contradicts the quantitative model, it is inconsistent with the given principles.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option C\n**Statement:** Create an additive score: $1$ point each for female sex, uncircumcised male, age $<12$ months, prior UTI, and ill appearance; test if the total score is $\\ge 1$; otherwise do not test.\n\n**Analysis:** This option proposes an additive scoring model. The established principle from the problem setup is a multiplicative model based on LRs. An additive model is fundamentally different and inconsistent with this principle. It implicitly treats all risk factors as having equal weight, which is contrary to the provided data (e.g., $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{uncirc male}} = 3.5$ vs. $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age }<12} = 1.4$). For a rule to be \"most consistent,\" it should follow the specified methodology. This rule does not. Option A describes the correct multiplicative methodology. Therefore, Option C is less consistent on principle alone. While its outcomes might coincidentally align in some cases, its core logic is flawed relative to the problem statement.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n### Option D\n**Statement:** Test only if the child is ill-appearing or has prior UTI; do not test well-appearing children without prior UTI, regardless of sex, age, or circumcision status.\n\n**Analysis:** This is another highly simplified rule. The second clause is a strong claim: \"do not test well-appearing children without prior UTI.\" We can test this against a high-risk patient who is well-appearing and has no prior UTI.\n-   Consider a well-appearing, uncircumcised male, age $9$ months, no prior UTI.\n-   LRs: $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{male uncirc}} = 3.5$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{age }<12} = 1.4$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{no prior}} = 1.0$, $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{well}} = 1.0$.\n-   $\\mathrm{LR}_{\\text{comb}} = 3.5 \\times 1.4 \\times 1.0 \\times 1.0 = 4.9$.\n-   $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\frac{1}{19} \\times 4.9 = \\frac{4.9}{19}$.\n-   $p_{\\text{est}} = \\frac{4.9}{19+4.9} = \\frac{4.9}{23.9} \\approx 0.205$.\n-   Decision: The risk is approximately $20.5\\%$, which is far above the $2\\%$ threshold ($p_{\\text{est}} \\ge p_T$). This child should be tested. Rule D states not to test this child.\n\nThe rule is definitively inconsistent with the provided data and principles.\n\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe total volume of fluid to be administered in the first $6$ hours, $V_{total,6h}$, is the sum of three components:\n1.  The initial bolus volume, $V_{bolus}$.\n2.  The maintenance fluid volume administered over $6$ hours, $V_{maint,6h}$.\n3.  The portion of the fluid deficit replaced over $6$ hours, $V_{def,6h}$.\n\nWe will calculate each component systematically.\n\n**1. Calculation of Total Fluid Deficit ($V_{def,total}$)**\nThe total fluid deficit is the volume of water lost, estimated as a fraction of the child's body weight. Since the density of water is approximately $1$ kg/L, a weight deficit corresponds directly to a volume deficit.\nThe child's weight is $W = 17.3$ kg.\nThe dehydration fraction is $f_d = 0.06$.\n$$V_{def,total} = W \\times f_d$$\n$$V_{def,total} = 17.3 \\text{ kg} \\times 0.06 = 1.038 \\text{ kg (mass of fluid deficit)}$$\nConverting this mass to volume in milliliters (mL):\n$$V_{def,total} = 1.038 \\text{ L} = 1038 \\text{ mL}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Initial Bolus Volume ($V_{bolus}$)**\nThe bolus is specified as $20$ mL for each kilogram of body weight.\n$$V_{bolus} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times W$$\n$$V_{bolus} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} \\times 17.3 \\text{ kg} = 346 \\text{ mL}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Remaining Deficit and its Replacement Rate ($R_{def}$)**\nThe remaining deficit, $V_{def,rem}$, is the total deficit less the volume already replaced by the initial bolus.\n$$V_{def,rem} = V_{def,total} - V_{bolus}$$\n$$V_{def,rem} = 1038 \\text{ mL} - 346 \\text{ mL} = 692 \\text{ mL}$$\nThis remaining deficit is to be replaced evenly over $24$ hours. The hourly rate of deficit replacement, $R_{def}$, is:\n$$R_{def} = \\frac{V_{def,rem}}{24 \\text{ h}} = \\frac{692 \\text{ mL}}{24 \\text{ h}}$$\n\n**4. Calculation of Maintenance Fluid Rate ($R_{maint}$) using the Holliday-Segar Method**\nThe daily maintenance fluid requirement is calculated based on body weight segments:\n-   $100$ mL/kg for the first $10$ kg of body weight.\n-   $50$ mL/kg for the next $10$ kg of body weight (from $10.1$ kg to $20$ kg).\n-   $20$ mL/kg for any weight above $20$ kg.\n\nFor a child weighing $W = 17.3$ kg:\n-   Fluid for the first $10$ kg: $10 \\text{ kg} \\times 100 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 1000 \\text{ mL}$.\n-   Fluid for the remaining weight ($17.3 \\text{ kg} - 10 \\text{ kg} = 7.3 \\text{ kg}$): $7.3 \\text{ kg} \\times 50 \\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 365 \\text{ mL}$.\n\nThe total daily maintenance fluid volume, $V_{maint,24h}$, is the sum of these amounts:\n$$V_{maint,24h} = 1000 \\text{ mL} + 365 \\text{ mL} = 1365 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe hourly maintenance rate, $R_{maint}$, is:\n$$R_{maint} = \\frac{V_{maint,24h}}{24 \\text{ h}} = \\frac{1365 \\text{ mL}}{24 \\text{ h}}$$\n\n**5. Calculation of Total Volume in the First 6 Hours ($V_{total,6h}$)**\nThe total fluid administered over the first $6$ hours includes the initial bolus, plus the maintenance and deficit replacement fluids infused during that period.\nThe volume of maintenance fluid over $6$ hours is:\n$$V_{maint,6h} = R_{maint} \\times 6 \\text{ h} = \\left(\\frac{1365}{24}\\right) \\times 6 = \\frac{1365}{4} \\text{ mL} = 341.25 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe volume of deficit replacement fluid over $6$ hours is:\n$$V_{def,6h} = R_{def} \\times 6 \\text{ h} = \\left(\\frac{692}{24}\\right) \\times 6 = \\frac{692}{4} \\text{ mL} = 173 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe total volume is the sum of these three parts:\n$$V_{total,6h} = V_{bolus} + V_{maint,6h} + V_{def,6h}$$\n$$V_{total,6h} = 346 \\text{ mL} + 341.25 \\text{ mL} + 173 \\text{ mL}$$\n$$V_{total,6h} = 860.25 \\text{ mL}$$\n\n**6.

The formula is given by:\n$$\neGFR = \\frac{k \\times H}{SCr}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant, $H$ is the patient's height in centimeters, and $SCr$ is the serum creatinine in milligrams per deciliter.\n\nThe given patient data are:\n- Height, $H = 95\\,\\text{cm}$\n- Serum creatinine, $SCr = 1.12\\,\\text{mg/dL}$\n- The coefficient $k$ appropriate for an enzymatic, isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS)-traceable creatinine assay is $k = 0.413$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the bedside Schwartz equation:\n$$\neGFR = \\frac{0.413 \\times 95}{1.12}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n0.413 \\times 95 = 39.235\n$$\nNow, divide by the serum creatinine value:\n$$\neGFR = \\frac{39.235}{1.12} \\approx 35.03125\\,\\text{mL/min per } 1.73\\,\\text{m}^2\n$$\nThe estimated glomerular filtration rate for this child is approximately $35.03\\,\\text{mL/min per } 1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$.\n\n**Step 2: Dose Adjustment and Calculation of Per-Dose Amount**\n\nThe institutional dosing policy for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is based on the calculated eGFR. The policy is as follows:\n- If $eGFR \\in [50, \\infty)$, administer $100\\%$ of the standard total daily dose.\n- If $eGFR \\in [30, 50)$, administer $75\\%$ of the standard total daily dose.\n- If $eGFR \\in [15, 30)$, administer $50\\%$ of the standard total daily dose.\n- If $eGFR  15$, the medication is contraindicated.\n\nOur calculated $eGFR$ is approximately $35.03\\,\\text{mL/min per } 1.73\\,\\text{m}^2$. This value falls within the interval $[30, 50)$, since $30 \\le 35.03  50$.

The patient's weight is $18.0\\,\\text{kg}$.\n$$\n\\text{Standard Total Daily Dose} = (\\text{Dose rate}) \\times (\\text{Weight})\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Standard Total Daily Dose} = (8\\,\\text{mg/kg/day}) \\times (18.0\\,\\text{kg}) = 144\\,\\text{mg/day}\n$$\nNow, we apply the renal adjustment factor of $75\\%$ (or $0.75$) to find the adjusted total daily dose:\n$$\n\\text{Adjusted Total Daily Dose} = (\\text{Standard Total Daily Dose}) \\times 0.75\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Adjusted Total Daily Dose} = (144\\,\\text{mg/day}) \\times 0.75 = 108\\,\\text{mg/day}\n$$\nThe problem states that the total daily dose is divided into two equal doses administered every $12$ hours. To find the amount per dose, we divide the adjusted total daily dose by $2$.\n$$\n\\text{Per-Dose Amount} = \\frac{\\text{Adjusted Total Daily Dose}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Per-Dose Amount} = \\frac{108\\,\\text{mg}}{2} = 54\\,\\text{mg}\n$$\nThe final step is to round the answer to three significant figures as requested. The number $54$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we add a decimal and a zero.\n$$\n\\text{Final Per-Dose Amount} = 54.0\\,\\text{mg}\n$$\nThus, the final per-dose trimethoprim amount for this child is $54.0\\,\\text{mg}$.",
