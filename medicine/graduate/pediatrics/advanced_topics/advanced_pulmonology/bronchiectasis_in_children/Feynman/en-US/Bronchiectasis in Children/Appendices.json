We will proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a child has Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that a child does not have PCD.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the nasal nitric oxide (nNO) test is positive.\nLet $T^-$ be the event that the nNO test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1.  The pre-test prevalence of PCD, which is the prior probability of a child in this cohort having the disease: $P(D) = 0.08$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the nNO test, which is the probability of a positive test result given that the child has PCD (the true positive rate): $P(T^+ | D) = 0.92$.\n3.  The specificity of the nNO test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the child does not have PCD (the true negative rate): $P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive and compute the post-test probability of PCD given a positive nNO test. This quantity is formally known as the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), and it is represented as the conditional probability $P(D | T^+)$.\n\nTo find this, we employ Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which considers both true positives (individuals with PCD who test positive) and false positives (individuals without PCD who test positive):\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nWe have most of the necessary components, but we first need to determine the probabilities $P(D^c)$ and $P(T^+ | D^c)$.\n\nThe probability of a child not having PCD is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92 $$\n\nThe probability $P(T^+ | D^c)$ is the false positive rate. This is the complement of the specificity (the true negative rate, $P(T^- | D^c)$), because for a person without the disease, the test can only be positive or negative.\n$$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 $$\n\nNow we can substitute these values into the formula for $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (0.92)(0.08) + (0.05)(0.92) $$\nCalculating the terms:\nThe probability of a true positive is $P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) = (0.92)(0.08) = 0.0736$.\nThe probability of a false positive is $P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) = (0.05)(0.92) = 0.046$.\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum of these two probabilities:\n$$ P(T^+) = 0.0736 + 0.046 = 0.1196 $$\n\nFinally, we can compute the post-test probability, $P(D | T^+)$, using Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.0736}{0.1196} $$\n$$ P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.6153846... $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $6$, $1$, $5$, and $3$. The fifth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ P(D | T^+) \\approx 0.6154 $$\n\nThis value is the positive predictive value of the test for this specific cohort.",

It requests a quantitative analysis based on provided data.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the percent predicted values for FEV$_1$ and FEF$_{25\\text{--}75}$ and the disproportion index $D$. The problem specifies that the \"percent predicted\" value, denoted with the subscript $\\text{pp}$, should be expressed as a unitless decimal ratio.\n\nFirst, we calculate the FEV$_1$ percent predicted ratio, $\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}}$. The formula is given by the ratio of the measured value to the predicted value.\n$$\n\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{meas}}}{\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pred}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{1.42}{1.90} \\approx 0.74736842...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\n\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}} = 0.7474\n$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the FEF$_{25\\text{--}75}$ percent predicted ratio, $\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}}$. The formula is analogous.\n$$\n\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75, \\text{meas}}}{\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75, \\text{pred}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{1.26}{2.75} \\approx 0.45818181...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}} = 0.4582\n$$\n\nThird, we compute the quantitative disproportion index $D$, which is defined as the difference between the two previously calculated ratios.\n$$\nD = \\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}} - \\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}}\n$$\nTo maintain precision, the calculation should be performed using values with higher precision before the final rounding step.\n$$\nD \\approx 0.74736842... - 0.45818181... = 0.28918661...\n$$\nRounding this final result to four significant figures:\n$$\nD = 0.2892\n$$\nIf one were to use the pre-rounded values for the component indices, the result is identical in this case: $D = 0.7474 - 0.4582 = 0.2892$.\n\nFinally, as requested for the working, we can infer the physiological meaning of these results. FEV$_1$ is a measure of airflow that is weighted towards the larger, more central airways. FEF$_{25\\text{--}75}$ specifically measures the average flow rate during the middle half of a forced expiration and is considered a more sensitive indicator of obstruction in the small to medium-sized peripheral airways. In this case, the FEV$_1$ is reduced to approximately $75\\%$ of predicted, while the FEF$_{25\\text{--}75}$ is more severely reduced to approximately $46\\%$ of predicted. The fact that $\\text{FEF}_{25\\text{--}75,\\text{pp}}$ is substantially lower than $\\text{FEV}_{1,\\text{pp}}$, resulting in a large positive disproportion index $D = 0.2892$, suggests that the obstructive process affects the smaller airways to a greater extent than the larger airways. This finding is characteristic of disproportionate small airway involvement, a common feature in bronchiectasis.\n\nThe three required numerical results are the FEV$_1$ percent predicted decimal ($0.7474$), the FEF$_{25\\text{--}75}$ percent predicted decimal ($0.4582$), and the disproportion index $D$ ($0.2892$).",

The child weighs $24$ kg and will be treated with amoxicillin-clavulanate by mouth. For this indication, a high-dose amoxicillin regimen of $80$–$90$ mg/kg/day divided twice daily (BID) is recommended to optimize time above the minimum inhibitory concentration. Clavulanate exposure should remain within established pediatric safety limits, defined here as no more than $10$ mg/kg/day and an absolute maximum of $250$ mg/day to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal intolerance and hepatic enzyme elevation.\n\nYou will use the high amoxicillin formulation amoxicillin-clavulanate ES-$600$ suspension, which contains $600$ mg of amoxicillin and $42.9$ mg of clavulanate per $5$ mL. Assume linear scaling between dose and exposure and ignore bioavailability differences between components for the purpose of this calculation.\n\nUsing the upper end of the amoxicillin target ($90$ mg/kg/day) divided twice daily, calculate the single per-dose volume (in mL) of the ES-$600$ suspension required for this $24$ kg child.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in pediatric pharmacology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its language. It presents a standard dose calculation problem without internal contradictions or violations of established principles.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the total daily dose of amoxicillin required for the child. The problem specifies using the upper end of the target range, which is $D_{amox,rate} = 90 \\text{ mg/kg/day}$. The child's weight is $W = 24 \\text{ kg}$.\n\nThe total daily amoxicillin dose, $D_{amox,total}$, is calculated as:\n$$D_{amox,total} = D_{amox,rate} \\times W$$\n$$D_{amox,total} = 90 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 24 \\text{ kg} = 2160 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nThis total daily dose is to be administered in a divided regimen, twice daily (BID). Therefore, the number of doses per day is $n=2$. The amount of amoxicillin per single dose, $D_{amox,single}$, is:\n$$D_{amox,single} = \\frac{D_{amox,total}}{n} = \\frac{2160 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}}{2 \\text{ doses/day}} = 1080 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dose}}$$\n\nNext, we must determine the volume of the amoxicillin-clavulanate ES-$600$ suspension that contains this single dose of amoxicillin. The suspension provides $600 \\text{ mg}$ of amoxicillin per $5 \\text{ mL}$ of volume. The concentration of amoxicillin, $C_{amox}$, is therefore:\n$$C_{amox} = \\frac{600 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mL}} = 120 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\nThe required volume for a single dose, $V_{single}$, is found by dividing the single amoxicillin dose by its concentration:\n$$V_{single} = \\frac{D_{amox,single}}{C_{amox}} = \\frac{1080 \\text{ mg}}{120 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}} = 9 \\text{ mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires confirmation that this dosage regimen does not exceed the specified safety limits for clavulanate. We must calculate the total daily clavulanate dose administered with this volume.\n\nFirst, we find the amount of clavulanate in a single dose of $9 \\text{ mL}$. The suspension contains $42.9 \\text{ mg}$ of clavulanate per $5 \\text{ mL}$. The concentration of clavulanate, $C_{clav}$, is:\n$$C_{clav} = \\frac{42.9 \\text{ mg}}{5 \\text{ mL}} = 8.58 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\nThe amount of clavulanate in a single $9 \\text{ mL}$ dose, $D_{clav,single}$, is:\n$$D_{clav,single} = C_{clav} \\times V_{single} = 8.58 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 9 \\text{ mL} = 77.22 \\text{ mg}$$\n\nThe total daily dose of clavulanate, $D_{clav,total}$, for a BID regimen is:\n$$D_{clav,total} = D_{clav,single} \\times n = 77.22 \\text{ mg} \\times 2 = 154.44 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{day}}$$\n\nNow we verify this total daily dose against the two safety limits provided:\n1.  **Maximum dose per body weight**: The limit is no more than $10 \\text{ mg/kg/day}$. We calculate the patient's daily clavulanate intake in mg/kg/day:\n    $$D_{clav,rate} = \\frac{D_{clav,total}}{W} = \\frac{154.44 \\text{ mg/day}}{24 \\text{ kg}} \\approx 6.435 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n    Since $6.435 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\leq 10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$, this limit is not exceeded.\n\n2.  **Absolute maximum daily dose**: The limit is $250 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n    Since $D_{clav,total} = 154.44 \\text{ mg/day} \\leq 250 \\text{ mg/day}$, this limit is also not exceeded.\n\nBoth clavulanate safety limits are met. The calculated single per-dose volume of $9 \\text{ mL}$ is correct and safe according to the problem's constraints.\n\nThe final answer must be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated volume is exactly $9 \\text{ mL}$. To express this with three significant figures, we write $9.00 \\text{ mL}$.",
