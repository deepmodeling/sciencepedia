The use of a $20\\,\\text{mL/kg}$ fluid bolus, the Holliday–Segar method for maintenance fluids, a multiplier for maintenance rate ($1.5\\times$), and a standard urine output target ($1\\,\\text{mL/kg/hr}$) are all standard, realistic clinical practices in pediatrics. The scenario of managing hypovolemia in pediatric acute pancreatitis is clinically relevant. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary quantitative data (weight, bolus rate, maintenance rate multiplier, time frame) and standard methods (Holliday–Segar) are provided. The objective—to calculate the net fluid balance—is clearly defined. The problem is self-contained and structured to yield a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to compute the cumulative net fluid balance ($\\Delta V$) over a period of $4\\,\\text{hours}$. This is defined as the total volume of fluid infused ($V_{in}$) minus the total volume of fluid excreted as urine ($V_{out}$).\n$$ \\Delta V = V_{in} - V_{out} $$\n\nThe calculation is performed in three parts: determining $V_{in}$, determining $V_{out}$, and then calculating their difference.\n\n**1. Calculation of Total Infused Volume ($V_{in}$)**\nThe total infused volume is the sum of the initial fluid bolus and the maintenance fluid infusion administered over the $4\\,\\text{hour}$ period.\n\n**a.

Maintenance Fluid Volume ($V_{maint, total}$)**\nFirst, we must calculate the standard hourly maintenance fluid rate using the Holliday–Segar method. The method is based on daily fluid requirements calculated from body weight.\nFor a weight $W$ in $\\text{kg}$, the daily fluid requirement is:\n- $100\\,\\text{mL/kg}$ for the first $10\\,\\text{kg}$ of body weight.\n- $50\\,\\text{mL/kg}$ for the next $10\\,\\text{kg}$ of body weight (from $10.1$ to $20\\,\\text{kg}$).\n- $20\\,\\text{mL/kg}$ for any weight above $20\\,\\text{kg}$.\n\nFor the $25\\,\\text{kg}$ child:\n- For the first $10\\,\\text{kg}$: $10\\,\\text{kg} \\times 100\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 1000\\,\\text{mL}$\n- For the next $10\\,\\text{kg}$: $10\\,\\text{kg} \\times 50\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 500\\,\\text{mL}$\n- For the remaining $5\\,\\text{kg}$: $(25-20)\\,\\text{kg} \\times 20\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 5\\,\\text{kg} \\times 20\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{kg}} = 100\\,\\text{mL}$\n\nThe total standard daily maintenance fluid volume ($V_{maint, day}$) is the sum of these amounts:\n$$ V_{maint, day} = 1000\\,\\text{mL} + 500\\,\\text{mL} + 100\\,\\text{mL} = 1600\\,\\text{mL} $$\nThe standard hourly maintenance rate ($R_{std}$) is this daily volume divided by $24\\,\\text{hours}$:\n$$ R_{std} = \\frac{1600\\,\\text{mL}}{24\\,\\text{hr}} = \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{hr}} $$\nThe problem states the prescribed rate ($R_{prescribed}$) is $1.5$ times this standard rate:\n$$ R_{prescribed} = 1.5 \\times R_{std} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{200}{3}\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{hr}} = 100\\,\\frac{\\text{mL}}{\\text{hr}} $$\nThis maintenance infusion runs for the entire $4\\,\\text{hour}$ period.

The use of simplified models (e.g., constant clearance and generation rates, instantaneous mixing) is a standard pedagogical and modeling approach to make complex systems tractable. The values are dimensionally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem has two parts: a qualitative explanation and a quantitative calculation.\n\n**Part 1: Explanation of Clinical Indicators**\n\nIn acute pancreatitis, a severe systemic inflammatory response is triggered. This leads to the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators that increase the permeability of systemic capillaries.\n\n1.  **Rising Hematocrit**: Hematocrit ($\\text{Hct}$) is the volume fraction of Red Blood Cells (RBCs) in whole blood, defined as $\\text{Hct} = V_{RBC} / V_{Blood}$, where $V_{Blood} = V_{RBC} + V_{Plasma}$. Due to increased capillary permeability, plasma fluid leaks from the intravascular compartment into the extravascular space (a phenomenon known as \"third-spacing\"). This leads to a decrease in plasma volume ($V_{Plasma}$). Since the volume of RBCs ($V_{RBC}$) remains relatively constant over short periods, the loss of plasma results in a higher concentration of RBCs in the remaining blood volume. Consequently, the hematocrit rises. This process, termed hemoconcentration, is a direct indicator of intravascular volume depletion. Inadequate fluid resuscitation fails to counteract this plasma loss, leading to a sustained or rising hematocrit.\n\n2.  **Rising Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)**: BUN is a measure of the concentration of urea in the blood. Urea is produced by the liver (generation, $G$) and cleared from the blood primarily by the kidneys (clearance, $\\text{Cl}$). The intravascular volume depletion described above leads to hypovolemia. The body responds to hypovolemia by reducing blood flow to the kidneys to preserve perfusion to more critical organs like the brain and heart. Reduced renal perfusion leads to a decrease in the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). Since renal clearance of urea is dependent on GFR, a lower GFR impairs the kidney's ability to excrete urea. With a relatively constant rate of urea generation ($G$), the decreased clearance ($\\text{Cl}$) causes urea to accumulate in the blood, leading to a rising BUN concentration. This condition is known as prerenal azotemia.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a rising hematocrit and a rising BUN is a hallmark of inadequate fluid resuscitation, signaling significant intravascular volume depletion and consequent renal hypoperfusion.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of BUN and Hematocrit at $t=24\\,\\text{hours}$**\n\nWe will model the system in two discrete time intervals: $t \\in [18, 21]$ and $t \\in [21, 24]$.\n\n**Initial State at $t=18\\,\\text{hours}$**\n- Child's weight, $W = 30\\,\\text{kg}$.\n- Total Body Water at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$ (before bolus): $\\text{TBW}_{18} = 0.60 \\times W = 0.60 \\times 30\\,\\text{kg} = 18\\,\\text{L}$.\n- Total Blood Volume at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$: $\\text{BV}_{18} = 80\\,\\text{mL/kg} \\times 30\\,\\text{kg} = 2400\\,\\text{mL} = 2.4\\,\\text{L}$.\n- Hematocrit at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$: $\\text{Hct}_{18} = 0.44$.\n- Red Blood Cell Volume (constant): $\\text{RBCV} = \\text{Hct}_{18} \\times \\text{BV}_{18} = 0.44 \\times 2.4\\,\\text{L} = 1.056\\,\\text{L}$.\n- Plasma Volume at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$: $\\text{PV}_{18} = \\text{BV}_{18} - \\text{RBCV} = 2.4\\,\\text{L} - 1.056\\,\\text{L} = 1.344\\,\\text{L}$.\n- BUN concentration at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$: $\\text{BUN}_{18} = 24\\,\\text{mg/dL} = 240\\,\\text{mg/L}$.\n- Mass of urea at $t=18\\,\\text{h}$: $M_{18} = \\text{BUN}_{18} \\times \\text{TBW}_{18} = 240\\,\\text{mg/L} \\times 18\\,\\text{L} = 4320\\,\\text{mg}$.\n\n**First Bolus and Interval 1 ($t \\in [18, 21]\\,\\text{hours}$)**\nAt $t=18\\,\\text{h}$, a fluid bolus is administered.\n- Bolus volume: $V_{bolus} = 20\\,\\text{mL/kg} \\times 30\\,\\text{kg} = 600\\,\\text{mL} = 0.6\\,\\text{L}$.\n- This bolus adds to the total body water.

This is the sum of the exposure required for all meals and snacks.\n\nThe target effective exposure for one full meal is:\n$$E_{meal} = T_{meal} \\times W$$\nThe target effective exposure for one snack is:\n$$E_{snack} = T_{snack} \\times W = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} T_{meal}\\right) \\times W$$\nThe total daily target effective exposure is the sum over all feedings:\n$$E_{total, daily} = (N_{meals} \\times E_{meal}) + (N_{snacks} \\times E_{snack})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $E_{meal}$ and $E_{snack}$:\n$$E_{total, daily} = (N_{meals} \\times T_{meal} \\times W) + \\left(N_{snacks} \\times \\frac{1}{2} T_{meal} \\times W\\right)$$\nFactoring out $T_{meal}$ and $W$:\n$$E_{total, daily} = T_{meal} \\times W \\times \\left(N_{meals} + \\frac{N_{snacks}}{2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$E_{total, daily} = (2000) \\times (20) \\times \\left(3 + \\frac{2}{2}\\right)$$\n$$E_{total, daily} = 40000 \\times (3 + 1) = 40000 \\times 4 = 160000\\,\\text{lipase units/day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total *administered* lipase dose, $L_{admin, total}$, required to achieve this effective exposure under acid suppression, using the survival fraction $f_{supp} = 0.90$.\n$$L_{admin, total} = \\frac{E_{total, daily}}{f_{supp}}$$\nSubstituting the value for $E_{total, daily}$:\n$$L_{admin, total} = \\frac{160000}{0.90} \\approx 177777.77...\\,\\text{lipase units/day}$$\n\nNow, we must check if this calculated dose exceeds the daily safety cap. The cap is given per kilogram of body weight, so we calculate the total cap for this child, $C_{total}$.\n$$C_{total} = C_{admin, daily} \\times W$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$C_{total} = 10000\\,\\text{lipase units/kg/day} \\times 20\\,\\text{kg} = 200000\\,\\text{lipase units/day}$$\n\nThe prescribed dose is the minimum of the calculated required dose and the safety cap. We compare $L_{admin, total}$ with $C_{total}$:\n$$177777.77... < 200000$$\nThe calculated required dose is less than the daily safety cap. Therefore, the prescribed dose is the calculated dose.\n$$L_{prescribed} = L_{admin, total} \\approx 177777.77...\\,\\text{lipase units}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The number is $177777.77...$. The first four significant digits are $1$, $7$, $7$, $7$. The fifth digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$1777... \\rightarrow 1778$$\nThe final rounded answer is $177800$. Expressed in scientific notation, this is $1.778 \\times 10^5$.",
