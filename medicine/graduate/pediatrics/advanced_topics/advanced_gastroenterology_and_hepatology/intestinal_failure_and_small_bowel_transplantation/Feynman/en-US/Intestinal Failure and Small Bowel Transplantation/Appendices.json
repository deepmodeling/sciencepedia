            "problem": "A $7$ kg infant with intestinal failure $2$ weeks after small bowel transplantation requires parenteral nutrition (PN). To promote anabolism while minimizing parenteral glucose exposure and the risk of PN-associated liver disease, the clinical team decides on the following design constraints for macronutrient provision, expressed per kilogram body weight per day: amino acids fixed at $3.0$ g/kg/day and lipid emulsion fixed at $2.5$ g/kg/day. The total nonprotein energy target is selected at the lower bound of the safe range to limit glucose load, setting total energy to $90$ kcal/kg/day. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) must not exceed $12$ mg/kg/min.\n\nUse only well-tested energy yields and definitions:\n- Dextrose provides $3.4$ kcal/g.\n- Amino acids provide $4$ kcal/g.\n- Lipid emulsion provides $9$ kcal/g.\n- The glucose infusion rate (GIR) is the delivery of glucose in mg/kg/min; to convert GIR to grams of dextrose per kg per day, multiply GIR by $1440$ min/day and divide by $1000$ mg/g.\n\nAssuming linear additivity of energy from dextrose, amino acids, and lipid, determine the unique glucose infusion rate (in mg/kg/min) that achieves exactly $90$ kcal/kg/day under the fixed amino acid and lipid doses above and verify it respects the GIR ceiling.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n- Infant weight: $7$ kg\n- Patient condition: Intestinal failure $2$ weeks after small bowel transplantation\n- Amino acid dose: Fixed at $3.0$ g/kg/day\n- Lipid emulsion dose: Fixed at $2.5$ g/kg/day\n- Total energy target: $90$ kcal/kg/day\n- Maximum glucose infusion rate (GIR): $12$ mg/kg/min\n- Energy yield of Dextrose: $3.4$ kcal/g\n- Energy yield of Amino acids: $4$ kcal/g\n- Energy yield of Lipid emulsion: $9$ kcal/g\n- GIR conversion formula: to convert GIR (mg/kg/min) to grams of dextrose per kg per day, multiply GIR by $1440$ min/day and divide by $1000$ mg/g.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against the specified criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical)**: The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of clinical nutrition and pediatric critical care. The energy yields for macronutrients ($3.4$ kcal/g for dextrose, $4$ kcal/g for amino acids, $9$ kcal/g for lipids) are standard values used in parenteral nutrition formulations. The concept of a Glucose Infusion Rate (GIR) and its typical therapeutic range (with a ceiling around $10$-$14$ mg/kg/min in infants) is a cornerstone of pediatric intravenous fluid management. The clinical scenario is realistic. The problem adheres to established scientific principles.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data (doses, energy targets, energy yields, conversion factors) to calculate a unique solution. The constraints are clearly defined, and the objective is specific. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It does not contain subjective claims or opinions.\n- **No Other Flaws**: The problem is not non-formalizable, incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, pseudo-profound, or outside scientific verifiability. It is a straightforward, although multi-step, calculation problem rooted in medical science. The inclusion of the patient's weight ($7$ kg) is contextually relevant but mathematically unnecessary for the per-kilogram calculations, which is a common feature in such problems and does not constitute a flaw.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe objective is to determine the complete parenteral nutrition regimen, specifically the required glucose infusion rate (GIR), that meets a total energy target while respecting given doses for amino acids and lipids and a ceiling on the GIR. The final regimen will be reported as a row vector.\n\nLet $E_{total}$ be the total energy target per kilogram per day, which is given as $E_{total} = 90$ kcal/kg/day.\nThe total energy is the sum of energy from amino acids ($E_{AA}$), lipids ($E_{L}$), and dextrose ($E_{Dex}$).\n$$E_{total} = E_{AA} + E_{L} + E_{Dex}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the energy provided by the fixed doses of amino acids and lipids.\nThe dose for amino acids is $D_{AA} = 3.0$ g/kg/day.\nThe energy yield of amino acids is $C_{AA} = 4$ kcal/g.\nThe energy from amino acids is:\n$$E_{AA} = D_{AA} \\times C_{AA} = 3.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 4 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 12 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n\nThe dose for lipids is $D_{L} = 2.5$ g/kg/day.\nThe energy yield of lipid emulsion is $C_{L} = 9$ kcal/g.\nThe energy from lipids is:\n$$E_{L} = D_{L} \\times C_{L} = 2.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} \\times 9 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}} = 22.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n\nNext, we determine the energy that must be supplied by dextrose to meet the total energy target.\n$$E_{Dex} = E_{total} - E_{AA} - E_{L}$$\n$$E_{Dex} = 90 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} - 12 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} - 22.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}} = 55.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n\nNow, we calculate the mass of dextrose required to provide this amount of energy.\nThe energy yield of dextrose is $C_{Dex} = 3.4$ kcal/g.\nLet $D_{Dex}$ be the required dose of dextrose in g/kg/day.\n$$D_{Dex} = \\frac{E_{Dex}}{C_{Dex}} = \\frac{55.5 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}}{3.4 \\, \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}}} = \\frac{55.5}{3.4} \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n$$D_{Dex} \\approx 16.323529... \\, \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}$$\n\nThe final step is to convert the dextrose dose from g/kg/day to the glucose infusion rate (GIR) in mg/kg/min.\nThe problem provides the conversion relationship. Let $GIR$ be the glucose infusion rate in mg/kg/min.\nThe dose in grams per kg per day, $D_{Dex}$, is related to GIR by:\n$$D_{Dex} \\left[\\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}\\right] = \\frac{GIR \\left[\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{min}}\\right] \\times 1440 \\left[\\frac{\\text{min}}{\\text{day}}\\right]}{1000 \\left[\\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{g}}\\right]}$$\nRearranging for GIR:\n$$GIR = \\frac{D_{Dex} \\times 1000}{1440} = D_{Dex} \\times \\frac{1000}{1440}$$\nSubstituting the value of $D_{Dex}$:\n$$GIR = \\left(\\frac{55.5}{3.4}\\right) \\times \\frac{1000}{1440} = \\frac{55.5}{3.4 \\times 1.44} = \\frac{55.5}{4.896}$$\n$$GIR \\approx 11.335784... \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{min}}$$\n\nWe must verify that this GIR does not exceed the maximum allowed rate, $GIR_{max} = 12$ mg/kg/min.\nSince $11.335784...  12$, the calculated GIR is valid and respects the clinical constraint.\n\nThe problem requires reporting the regimen as a row vector in the order (amino acids in g/kg/day, lipid emulsion in g/kg/day, GIR in mg/kg/min), with each element rounded to four significant figures.\n- Amino acid dose: $D_{AA} = 3.0$ g/kg/day. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $3.000$.\n- Lipid emulsion dose: $D_{L} = 2.5$ g/kg/day. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $2.500$.\n- Glucose Infusion Rate: $GIR \\approx 11.335784...$ mg/kg/min. The fifth significant digit is $5$, so we round the fourth digit up. Rounded to four significant figures, this is $11.34$.\n\nThe final regimen vector is $(3.000, 2.500, 11.34)$.",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is developed by methodically addressing the four tasks posed in the problem statement, using the principles of fluid and solute balance.\n\n**Task 1: Definition and Classification of High-Output Ostomy**\n\nFirst, we establish the clinical definition of a high-output ostomy in a pediatric patient. While definitions can vary slightly, a commonly accepted threshold for a high-output stoma is an effluent volume exceeding $40 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}$. This level of output is significant enough to risk dehydration and electrolyte imbalance if not appropriately replaced.\n\nNext, we calculate the infant's ostomy output normalized to body weight:\n$$ \\text{Output Rate} = \\frac{V_{\\text{ost}}}{W} $$\nGiven $V_{\\text{ost}} = 500 \\ \\text{mL}$ over a $24$-hour period and $W = 9.0 \\ \\text{kg}$:\n$$ \\text{Output Rate} = \\frac{500 \\ \\text{mL}}{9.0 \\ \\text{kg}} \\approx 55.6 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1} $$\nSince $55.6 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1} > 40 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}$, the infant's jejunostomy is correctly classified as a **high-output ostomy**.\n\n**Task 2: Net Overnight Fluid Requirement**\n\nThe total daily fluid requirement, $V_{\\text{req, total}}$, is the sum of maintenance fluid needs and a volume to replace ongoing losses.\n\nThe daily maintenance fluid volume, $V_{\\text{maint}}$, is calculated using the Holliday–Segar method for an infant with $W = 9.0 \\ \\text{kg}$:\n$$ V_{\\text{maint}} = (100 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (9.0 \\ \\text{kg}) = 900 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1} $$\nThe fluid loss to be replaced, $V_{\\text{losses}}$, is the measured jejunostomy output:\n$$ V_{\\text{losses}} = V_{\\text{ost}} = 500 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1} $$\nThe total daily fluid requirement is:\n$$ V_{\\text{req, total}} = V_{\\text{maint}} + V_{\\text{losses}} = 900 \\ \\text{mL} + 500 \\ \\text{mL} = 1400 \\ \\text{mL} $$\nTo find the net fluid volume to be delivered overnight, $V_{\\text{night}}$, we subtract the daytime oral intake, $V_{\\text{oral}}$, from the total requirement:\n$$ V_{\\text{night}} = V_{\\text{req, total}} - V_{\\text{oral}} = 1400 \\ \\text{mL} - 900 \\ \\text{mL} = 500 \\ \\text{mL} $$\nThis is the volume of fluid to be infused over the $T_{\\text{night}} = 12 \\ \\text{h}$ period.\n\n**Task 3: Net Overnight Sodium Requirement**\n\nThe total daily sodium requirement, $Na_{\\text{req, total}}$, is the sum of maintenance sodium needs and the amount needed to replace sodium lost in the ostomy effluent.\n\nThe daily maintenance sodium, $Na_{\\text{maint}}$, is:\n$$ Na_{\\text{maint}} = (2 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{kg}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1}) \\times (9.0 \\ \\text{kg}) = 18 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{day}^{-1} $$\nThe sodium loss, $Na_{\\text{losses}}$, is the product of the ostomy output volume and its sodium concentration. Note that concentrations must be in consistent units ($1 \\ \\text{L} = 1000 \\ \\text{mL}$).\n$$ [\\text{Na}]_{\\text{ost}} = 100 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_{\\text{ost}} = 500 \\ \\text{mL} = 0.500 \\ \\text{L} $$\n$$ Na_{\\text{losses}} = [\\text{Na}]_{\\text{ost}} \\times V_{\\text{ost}} = (100 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.500 \\ \\text{L}) = 50 \\ \\text{mmol} $$\nThe total daily sodium requirement is:\n$$ Na_{\\text{req, total}} = Na_{\\text{maint}} + Na_{\\text{losses}} = 18 \\ \\text{mmol} + 50 \\ \\text{mmol} = 68 \\ \\text{mmol} $$\nNext, we calculate the sodium provided by the daytime oral intake, $Na_{\\text{oral}}$:\n$$ [\\text{Na}]_{\\text{formula}} = 20 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_{\\text{oral}} = 900 \\ \\text{mL} = 0.900 \\ \\text{L} $$\n$$ Na_{\\text{oral}} = [\\text{Na}]_{\\text{formula}} \\times V_{\\text{oral}} = (20 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}) \\times (0.900 \\ \\text{L}) = 18 \\ \\text{mmol} $$\nThe net sodium to be delivered parenterally overnight, $Na_{\\text{night}}$, is the total requirement minus the oral intake:\n$$ Na_{\\text{night}} = Na_{\\text{req, total}} - Na_{\\text{oral}} = 68 \\ \\text{mmol} - 18 \\ \\text{mmol} = 50 \\ \\text{mmol} $$\n\n**Task 4: Isotonic Saline Infusion Rate**\n\nThe final task is to compute the infusion rate of isotonic sodium chloride required to deliver the calculated overnight sodium requirement, $Na_{\\text{night}} = 50 \\ \\text{mmol}$. The problem specifies using isotonic sodium chloride, which has a sodium concentration of $[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{iso}} = 154 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}$, as the delivery vehicle.\n\nFirst, we determine the volume of isotonic sodium chloride, $V_{\\text{iso, needed}}$, that contains $50 \\ \\text{mmol}$ of sodium:\n$$ V_{\\text{iso, needed}} = \\frac{Na_{\\text{night}}}{[\\text{Na}]_{\\text{iso}}} = \\frac{50 \\ \\text{mmol}}{154 \\ \\text{mmol} \\cdot \\text{L}^{-1}} = \\frac{50}{154} \\ \\text{L} $$\nConverting this volume to milliliters:\n$$ V_{\\text{iso, needed}} = \\frac{50}{154} \\times 1000 \\ \\text{mL} \\approx 324.6753 \\ \\text{mL} $$\nThis volume is to be infused over the overnight period of $T_{\\text{night}} = 12 \\ \\text{h}$. The constant infusion rate, $R$, is:\n$$ R = \\frac{V_{\\text{iso, needed}}}{T_{\\text{night}}} = \\frac{324.6753 \\ \\text{mL}}{12 \\ \\text{h}} \\approx 27.056275 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{h}^{-1} $$\nIt is noted that this calculated volume of $325 \\ \\text{mL}$ is less than the total overnight fluid requirement of $500 \\ \\text{mL}$ calculated in Task 2. A complete clinical prescription would involve mixing this volume of saline with a sodium-free fluid (e.g., dextrose in water) to achieve the total required volume. However, the problem asks specifically for the infusion rate of the isotonic sodium chloride component itself, which we have calculated.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required:\n$$ R \\approx 27.1 \\ \\text{mL} \\cdot \\text{h}^{-1} $$",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n**Part 1: Mass-Balance Argument**\n\nWe are asked to justify the monotonic relationship between functional enterocyte mass and plasma citrulline concentration under specific assumptions. We can construct a simple pharmacokinetic model based on a steady-state mass-balance argument.\n\nLet the following variables be defined:\n-   $M_E$ [mass]: the total functional mass of mature enterocytes.\n-   $[Cit]_p$ [moles/volume]: the concentration of citrulline in the plasma.\n-   $k_{prod}$ [moles/(mass$\\cdot$time)]: the specific rate of citrulline synthesis per unit of enterocyte mass. The problem assumes a stable supply of the precursor, glutamine, which allows us to treat $k_{prod}$ as a constant.\n-   $C_R$ [volume/time]: the renal clearance rate of citrulline, representing the volume of plasma cleared of citrulline per unit time. The problem assumes normal renal function, so $C_R$ is constant.\n\nThe total rate of citrulline production, $R_{prod}$ [moles/time], is directly proportional to the functional enterocyte mass, as citrulline is stated to be synthesized primarily by these cells.\n$$ R_{prod} = k_{prod} M_E $$\n\nThe total rate of citrulline clearance from the plasma, $R_{clear}$ [moles/time], is a product of the renal clearance rate and the plasma concentration of citrulline.\n$$ R_{clear} = C_R [Cit]_p $$\n\nThe problem asks for an analysis under steady-state conditions. At steady state, the rate of production must equal the rate of clearance.\n$$ R_{prod} = R_{clear} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for production and clearance gives:\n$$ k_{prod} M_E = C_R [Cit]_p $$\nWe can now solve for the steady-state plasma citrulline concentration, $[Cit]_p$, as a function of enterocyte mass, $M_E$.\n$$ [Cit]_p = \\left( \\frac{k_{prod}}{C_R} \\right) M_E $$\nUnder the given assumptions, $k_{prod}$ and $C_R$ are positive constants. The ratio $\\frac{k_{prod}}{C_R}$ is therefore a single positive constant of proportionality. This equation shows that the steady-state plasma citrulline concentration is directly proportional to the functional enterocyte mass. A direct proportionality is a strictly increasing linear relationship, which is a specific and strong form of a monotonic relationship. Therefore, as $M_E$ increases, $[Cit]_p$ increases, and as $M_E$ decreases, $[Cit]_p$ decreases. This justifies the physiological premise that a reduction in enterocyte mass, as occurs in acute cellular rejection, leads to a lower plasma citrulline concentration.\n\n**Part 2: Predictive Value Calculations**\n\nWe are tasked with deriving expressions for the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) and then calculating them for three different test thresholds.\n\nLet the events be defined as:\n-   $D$: The patient has the disease (moderate rejection).\n-   $D^c$: The patient does not have the disease.\n-   $T^+$: The test result is positive (plasma citrulline is below the threshold).\n-   $T^-$: The test result is negative (plasma citrulline is at or above the threshold).\n\nThe given values are:\n-   Prevalence, $p = P(D) = 0.25$. Consequently, $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 0.75$.\n-   Sensitivity, $S_n = P(T^+ | D)$.\n-   Specificity, $S_p = P(T^- | D^c)$.\n\n**Derivation of PPV:**\nThe positive predictive value is the probability of having the disease given a positive test, $PPV = P(D | T^+)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem):\n$$ PPV = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. By the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nWe are given $P(T^+ | D) = S_n$ and $P(D) = p$. We can express $P(T^+ | D^c)$ in terms of specificity: $P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - S_p$. Also, $P(D^c) = 1 - p$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^+)$:\n$$ P(T^+) = (S_n)(p) + (1 - S_p)(1 - p) $$\nSubstituting this back into the PPV formula yields the desired expression:\n$$ PPV = \\frac{S_n p}{S_n p + (1 - S_p)(1 - p)} $$\n\n**Derivation of NPV:**\nThe negative predictive value is the probability of not having the disease given a negative test, $NPV = P(D^c | T^-)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$ NPV = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. By the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D) $$\nWe are given $P(T^- | D^c) = S_p$. We can express $P(T^- | D)$ in terms of sensitivity: $P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - S_n$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T^-)$:\n$$ P(T^-) = (S_p)(1 - p) + (1 - S_n)(p) $$\nSubstituting this back into the NPV formula yields the desired expression:\n$$ NPV = \\frac{S_p (1-p)}{S_p (1-p) + (1 - S_n)p} $$\n\n**Calculations:**\nWe use $p=0.25$ and $1-p=0.75$.\n\n**Threshold $10$ $\\mu$mol/L:**\n$S_n = 0.55$, $S_p = 0.95$.\n$$ PPV_{10} = \\frac{(0.55)(0.25)}{(0.55)(0.25) + (1 - 0.95)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.1375}{0.1375 + (0.05)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.1375}{0.1375 + 0.0375} = \\frac{0.1375}{0.175} \\approx 0.785714 $$\n$$ NPV_{10} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.75)}{(0.95)(0.75) + (1 - 0.55)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.7125}{0.7125 + (0.45)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.7125}{0.7125 + 0.1125} = \\frac{0.7125}{0.825} \\approx 0.863636 $$\nTo four significant figures: $PPV_{10} = 0.7857$, $NPV_{10} = 0.8636$.\n\n**Threshold $15$ $\\mu$mol/L:**\n$S_n = 0.75$, $S_p = 0.85$.\n$$ PPV_{15} = \\frac{(0.75)(0.25)}{(0.75)(0.25) + (1 - 0.85)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.1875}{0.1875 + (0.15)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.1875}{0.1875 + 0.1125} = \\frac{0.1875}{0.3000} = 0.625 $$\n$$ NPV_{15} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.75)}{(0.85)(0.75) + (1 - 0.75)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.6375}{0.6375 + (0.25)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.6375}{0.6375 + 0.0625} = \\frac{0.6375}{0.7000} \\approx 0.910714 $$\nTo four significant figures: $PPV_{15} = 0.6250$, $NPV_{15} = 0.9107$.\n\n**Threshold $20$ $\\mu$mol/L:**\n$S_n = 0.88$, $S_p = 0.70$.\n$$ PPV_{20} = \\frac{(0.88)(0.25)}{(0.88)(0.25) + (1 - 0.70)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.22}{0.22 + (0.30)(0.75)} = \\frac{0.22}{0.22 + 0.225} = \\frac{0.22}{0.445} \\approx 0.494382 $$\n$$ NPV_{20} = \\frac{(0.70)(0.75)}{(0.70)(0.75) + (1 - 0.88)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.525}{0.525 + (0.12)(0.25)} = \\frac{0.525}{0.525 + 0.03} = \\frac{0.525}{0.555} \\approx 0.945945 $$\nTo four significant figures: $PPV_{20} = 0.4944$, $NPV_{20} = 0.9459$.\n\nThe six requested values in the specified order are:\n$(\\mathrm{PPV}_{10}, \\mathrm{NPV}_{10}, \\mathrm{PPV}_{15}, \\mathrm{NPV}_{15}, \\mathrm{PPV}_{20}, \\mathrm{NPV}_{20}) = (0.7857, 0.8636, 0.6250, 0.9107, 0.4944, 0.9459)$.",
