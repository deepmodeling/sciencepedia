            "introduction": "Genetic counseling for X-linked diseases like X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (XLA) can be challenging, especially when genetic test results seem to contradict a strong family history. This scenario introduces Bayes' theorem as a powerful tool to formally combine prior probabilities, such as those derived from a family structure, with the likelihood of new evidence from a genetic test. By doing so, we can arrive at a more accurate posterior probability that reflects all available information. This practice  is designed to sharpen your skills in probabilistic reasoning, demonstrating how to quantify clinical judgment when faced with imperfect diagnostic tests and seemingly conflicting data.",

            "problem": "A woman has three sons: two are clinically diagnosed with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA), and one is unaffected. Assume full penetrance for XLA in males and that the sexes of the offspring are fixed and known to be male. The disease is due to pathogenic variants in the Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) gene. Let the hypothesis $H_{C}$ denote that the mother is a constitutional heterozygous carrier of a pathogenic BTK variant, and let $H_{N}$ denote that she is not a carrier. Assume that, before considering her offspring or any genetic testing, the mother’s prior probability of being a carrier is $p_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}$. If she is a carrier ($H_{C}$), each son independently has probability $1/2$ of being affected. If she is not a carrier ($H_{N}$), each son independently has a small probability $d$ of being affected by a de novo BTK mutation; take $d = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n\nThe mother undergoes comprehensive BTK testing by next-generation sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis. The analytic sensitivity for detecting a true heterozygous carrier in blood is $s = 0.98$, and the analytic specificity is $t = 0.999$. The mother’s test returns negative (no pathogenic variant detected).\n\nUsing the axioms of probability and Bayes’ theorem, and assuming independence of offspring outcomes across pregnancies and independence of the test result from the offspring phenotypes conditional on $H_{C}$ or $H_{N}$, compute the posterior probability that the mother is a carrier, $P(H_{C} \\mid \\text{two affected sons, one unaffected son, negative BTK test})$.

            "problem": "A male neonate with a family history consistent with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) is born at term. In XLA, a pathogenic variant in Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) prevents mature B-cell development, leading to negligible endogenous immunoglobulin G (IgG) production. At birth, the neonate has maternally transferred immunoglobulin G (IgG) acquired via transplacental transport that subsequently declines. Consider a first-order elimination pharmacokinetic model for maternally derived IgG in which the concentration $I(t)$ (in mg/dL) is governed by a single-compartment process with rate constant $k$ and negligible endogenous production. Let $t$ be time in days from birth, $I(0) = I_0$ be the initial concentration, and $t_{1/2}$ be the IgG half-life. Assume $I_0 = 900$ mg/dL, $t_{1/2} = 28$ days, and $k = \\ln(2) / t_{1/2}$.

He is to receive periodic Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy as an instantaneous intravenous bolus once every four weeks to maintain protective serum IgG levels. Immediately before initiation of this regimen, his measured baseline trough serum IgG concentration is $300$ mg/dL. You are asked to determine the single monthly IVIG dose in mg/kg that will, at steady state, raise the trough serum IgG concentration to $800$ mg/dL. Use the following scientifically grounded pharmacokinetic assumptions and parameters:\n\n- The kinetics of IgG can be modeled as a one-compartment system with linear, first-order elimination, and the IV dose has bioavailability $F = 1$.\n- The volume of distribution (Vd) of IgG is $V_{d} = 0.07$ L/kg.\n- The elimination half-life of IgG is $t_{1/2} = 21$ days, and the dosing interval is $\\tau = 28$ days.\n- Between doses, IgG concentration decays exponentially according to first-order elimination, and repeated dosing at fixed interval $\\tau$ leads to a steady-state geometric accumulation.\n- The $300$ mg/dL baseline is an independent background level (not attributable to the new regimen), so your calculation should add the exogenous steady-state contribution from IVIG to reach the $800$ mg/dL target trough.\n\nStarting from fundamental mass balance and first-order elimination, derive the required monthly dose per kilogram that achieves the specified steady-state trough. Clearly account for distribution and clearance in your derivation. Convert concentration units appropriately where needed.

            "solution": "First, we define the objective: to calculate the dose per kilogram of body weight, which we denote as $D_{dose}$, that will raise the trough IgG concentration from a baseline value to a target value at steady state.\n\nThe total target steady-state trough concentration, $C_{trough, ss, total}$, is given as $800$ mg/dL. The patient has a baseline trough concentration, $C_{trough, baseline}$, of $300$ mg/dL, which is independent of the new IVIG regimen. Therefore, the increase in trough concentration that must be provided solely by the periodic IVIG administration, denoted as $C_{trough, ss, IVIG}$, is the difference between the total target and the baseline:\n$$C_{trough, ss, IVIG} = C_{trough, ss, total} - C_{trough, baseline} = 800 \\text{ mg/dL} - 300 \\text{ mg/dL} = 500 \\text{ mg/dL}$$\n\nThe kinetics of IgG are described by a one-compartment model with first-order elimination. The concentration of IgG, $C(t)$, at any time $t$ after a single intravenous bolus dose decays exponentially according to the equation:\n$$C(t) = C_0 \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the initial concentration immediately after the dose, and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. The constant $k_e$ is related to the elimination half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nGiven $t_{1/2} = 21$ days, the elimination rate constant is:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{21 \\text{ days}}$$\n\nThe dosing regimen consists of repeated IV bolus doses at a fixed interval, $\\tau = 28$ days. At steady state, the amount of drug eliminated during one dosing interval is equal to the dose administered. Let $D$ be the total dose administered and $V_d$ be the total volume of distribution. The initial increase in concentration after a dose is $\\Delta C = D/V_d$.\n\nLet $C_{trough, ss}$ be the trough concentration at steady state (just before a dose) and $C_{max, ss}$ be the peak concentration at steady state (just after a dose).\nThe relationship is:\n$$C_{max, ss} = C_{trough, ss} + \\frac{D}{V_d}$$\nOver the dosing interval $\\tau$, the concentration decays from $C_{max, ss}$ back down to $C_{trough, ss}$:\n$$C_{trough, ss} = C_{max, ss} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{max, ss}$:\n$$C_{trough, ss} = \\left(C_{trough, ss} + \\frac{D}{V_d}\\right) \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nWe now solve this equation for $C_{trough, ss}$:\n$$C_{trough, ss} = C_{trough, ss} \\exp(-k_e \\tau) + \\frac{D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{trough, ss} (1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)) = \\frac{D}{V_d} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n$$C_{trough, ss} = \\frac{D}{V_d} \\frac{\\exp(-k_e \\tau)}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(k_e \\tau)$ gives a more convenient form:\n$$C_{trough, ss} = \\frac{D}{V_d} \\frac{1}{\\exp(k_e \\tau) - 1}$$\nOur goal is to find the required dose.

The volume of distribution is also given per unit body weight, $V_{d,spec} = 0.07$ L/kg. If we let $W$ be the patient's body weight in kg, then $D = D_{dose} \\cdot W$ and $V_d = V_{d,spec} \\cdot W$. Substituting these into the equation for $D$:\n$$D_{dose} \\cdot W = C_{trough, ss} \\cdot (V_{d,spec} \\cdot W) \\cdot (\\exp(k_e \\tau) - 1)$$\nThe body weight $W$ cancels from both sides, yielding the formula for the dose per kilogram:\n$$D_{dose} = C_{trough, ss, IVIG} \\cdot V_{d,spec} \\cdot (\\exp(k_e \\tau) - 1)$$\nHere, we use $C_{trough, ss, IVIG}$ as this is the concentration contribution we aim to achieve with our dosing regimen.\n\nNow we substitute the given values.

The target concentration $C_{trough, ss, IVIG}$ is $500$ mg/dL, and the specific volume of distribution $V_{d,spec}$ is $0.07$ L/kg. We convert the concentration from mg/dL to mg/L:\n$$C_{trough, ss, IVIG} = 500 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} \\times \\frac{10 \\text{ dL}}{1 \\text{ L}} = 5000 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}$$\nNow we can calculate the dose:\n$$D_{dose} = \\left(5000 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{L}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(0.07 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{kg}}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\ln(2)\\right) - 1\\right)$$\nThe term in the parentheses can be simplified:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\ln(2)\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\ln\\left(2^{4/3}\\right)\\right) = 2^{4/3}$$\nSo the equation for the dose becomes:\n$$D_{dose} = (5000 \\cdot 0.07) \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\cdot (2^{4/3} - 1)$$\n$$D_{dose} = 350 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} \\cdot (2^{4/3} - 1)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$2^{4/3} \\approx 2.519842$$\n$$D_{dose} \\approx 350 \\cdot (2.519842 - 1) \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n$$D_{dose} \\approx 350 \\cdot (1.519842) \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\n$$D_{dose} \\approx 531.9447 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$D_{dose} \\approx 532 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$$\nThus, the required monthly IVIG dose is $532$ mg/kg to achieve the target steady-state trough concentration of $800$ mg/dL.",
