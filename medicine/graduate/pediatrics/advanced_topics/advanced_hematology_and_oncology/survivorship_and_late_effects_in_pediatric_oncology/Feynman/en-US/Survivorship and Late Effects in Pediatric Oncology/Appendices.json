This practice introduces fundamental epidemiological tools for this purpose, specifically by comparing the mortality experience of a hypothetical cohort of childhood cancer survivors to the general population.

            "problem": "A cohort of childhood cancer survivors treated with risk-adapted multimodal therapy over the last four decades is followed to quantify late mortality attributable to treatment-related late effects. Let the cohort accumulate $100{,}000$ person-years of observation. Over this period, an external comparison using age-, sex-, and calendar-year–specific mortality rates from the general population yields an expected number of deaths of $12$, while the observed number of deaths in the survivor cohort is $50$.\n\nStarting from the core epidemiologic definitions that expected deaths are obtained by integrating or summing the baseline population mortality hazard against the cohort’s person-time, and that multiplicative and additive excesses are quantified by ratios and differences of observed and expected event counts, respectively, derive and compute the following quantities:\n\n- The Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), defined as the ratio of observed to expected deaths.\n- The Excess Relative Risk (ERR), defined as the multiplicative excess over baseline implied by the SMR.\n- The Excess Absolute Risk (EAR) per $100{,}000$ person-years, defined as the difference between observed and expected deaths normalized by total person-time and expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\nReport your final answer as the ordered triple $\\left(\\mathrm{SMR}, \\mathrm{ERR}, \\mathrm{EAR}\\right)$, rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Total person-years of observation: $100{,}000$ person-years.\n- Expected number of deaths ($E$): $12$.\n- Observed number of deaths ($O$): $50$.\n- Definition of Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR): The ratio of observed to expected deaths.\n- Definition of Excess Relative Risk (ERR): The multiplicative excess over baseline implied by the SMR.\n- Definition of Excess Absolute Risk (EAR): The difference between observed and expected deaths normalized by total person-time and expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental and standard concepts in epidemiology and public health, specifically those used in cohort studies to quantify risk. The quantities SMR, ERR, and EAR are well-established metrics. The context of late mortality in childhood cancer survivors is a real and significant area of medical research. The data provided are plausible within this context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary data ($O$, $E$, and person-years) and explicit definitions for the quantities to be calculated (SMR, ERR, EAR). A unique and stable solution can be determined from the provided information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free of subjective claims or opinions.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is complete and self-consistent. There is no missing information required for the calculations, nor are there any contradictory constraints.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The provided data are numerically and contextually realistic for a long-term follow-up study of a cohort of cancer survivors. An observed number of deaths of $50$ versus an expected $12$ yields an SMR of approximately $4.17$, a value that is high but not implausible for such a high-risk group.\n- **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-structured with unambiguous definitions and a clear objective. There is no circular reasoning.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $O$ be the observed number of deaths, $E$ be the expected number of deaths, and $PY$ be the total person-years of observation. From the problem statement, we have:\n- $O = 50$\n- $E = 12$\n- $PY = 100{,}000$ person-years\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of three quantities: the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), the Excess Relative Risk (ERR), and the Excess Absolute Risk (EAR).\n\n**1. Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR)**\nThe SMR is defined as the ratio of observed to expected deaths.\n$$ \\text{SMR} = \\frac{O}{E} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{SMR} = \\frac{50}{12} = \\frac{25}{6} \\approx 4.1666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{SMR} \\approx 4.167 $$\n\n**2. Excess Relative Risk (ERR)**\nThe ERR is defined as the multiplicative excess over the baseline risk. The baseline risk corresponds to an SMR of $1$. The ERR is therefore the portion of the SMR that is greater than $1$.\n$$ \\text{ERR} = \\text{SMR} - 1 $$\nUsing the exact fraction for SMR to maintain precision before the final rounding:\n$$ \\text{ERR} = \\frac{50}{12} - 1 = \\frac{50}{12} - \\frac{12}{12} = \\frac{50 - 12}{12} = \\frac{38}{12} = \\frac{19}{6} \\approx 3.1666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\text{ERR} \\approx 3.167 $$\n\n**3. Excess Absolute Risk (EAR)**\nThe EAR is defined as the difference between observed and expected deaths (the number of excess deaths), normalized by the total person-time. This result is then scaled to be expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years.\nFirst, we calculate the number of excess deaths:\n$$ \\text{Excess Deaths} = O - E = 50 - 12 = 38 $$\nNext, we calculate the rate of excess deaths per person-year:\n$$ \\text{Excess Death Rate} = \\frac{O - E}{PY} = \\frac{38}{100{,}000} \\text{ per person-year} $$\nThe problem requires the EAR to be expressed per $100{,}000$ person-years. To achieve this, we multiply the per-person-year rate by $100{,}000$.\n$$ \\text{EAR}_{\\text{per } 100,000 \\text{ PY}} = \\left( \\frac{O - E}{PY} \\right) \\times 100{,}000 $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{EAR} = \\left( \\frac{50 - 12}{100{,}000} \\right) \\times 100{,}000 = \\frac{38}{100{,}000} \\times 100{,}000 = 38 $$\nThe value is an exact integer, $38$. To present this value with four significant figures as requested, we write it as $38.00$.\n\nThe final ordered triple $(\\mathrm{SMR}, \\mathrm{ERR}, \\mathrm{EAR})$ with values rounded to four significant figures is $(4.167, 3.167, 38.00)$.",

            "problem": "In a cohort of childhood cancer survivors, cardiomyopathy events are modeled using the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) framework, where the instantaneous hazard function $h(t)$ for an individual at time $t$ is multiplicatively related to a baseline hazard $h_{0}(t)$ and a log-linear function of exposures.

It presents a clear, self-contained, and scientifically grounded scenario using a standard biostatistical model, the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, which is widely applied in medical research, including the study of late effects in oncology. All necessary parameters and data are provided, and the objective is a straightforward calculation based on the given formula.\n\nThe instantaneous hazard function, $h(t)$, is given by the CPH model:\n$$h(t) = h_{0}(t)\\exp(\\beta_{1}d_{\\text{anth}} + \\beta_{2}\\mathrm{RT}_{\\text{heart}})$$\nwhere $h(t)$ is the hazard rate at time $t$, $h_{0}(t)$ is the baseline hazard function, $d_{\\text{anth}}$ is the cumulative anthracycline dose, $\\mathrm{RT}_{\\text{heart}}$ is the mean heart radiotherapy dose, and $\\beta_{1}$ and $\\beta_{2}$ are the respective exposure-response coefficients.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe baseline hazard is constant: $h_{0}(t) = 0.001$ events per person-year.\nThe coefficient for anthracycline dose: $\\beta_{1} = 0.006$ per $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\nThe coefficient for radiotherapy dose: $\\beta_{2} = 0.03$ per Gray (Gy).\nThe individual's anthracycline exposure: $d_{\\text{anth}} = 300$ $\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\nThe individual's radiotherapy exposure: $\\mathrm{RT}_{\\text{heart}} = 10$ Gy.\n\nFirst, we calculate the linear combination of the covariates in the exponent, which is often called the risk score or prognostic index.

Since the baseline hazard $h_{0}(t)$ is given as a constant value of $0.001$, the hazard $h(t)$ will also be constant with respect to time $t$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of survival analysis and competing risks, provides a complete and consistent set of givens, is well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. We may, therefore, proceed with solving the problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation and computation of the $10$-year cumulative incidence function (CIF) for a late cardiotoxic effect (cause $1$) in the presence of a competing risk of death (cause $2$).\n\nLet $T$ be the time to the first event (either the late effect or death) and let $J \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ be the cause of the event.
