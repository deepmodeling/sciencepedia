            "introduction": "The cornerstone of curative treatment for localized osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma is complete surgical resection of the tumor. A critical factor for preventing local recurrence is achieving adequate oncologic margins, which requires removing the tumor along with a cuff of surrounding normal tissue. This practice  provides a hands-on exercise in surgical planning, where you will translate radiological findings, including the presence of a discontinuous skip lesion, into a quantitative resection length to ensure oncologically sound margins.",

            "problem": "A 12-year-old patient is diagnosed with a primary malignant bone tumor consistent with osteosarcoma or Ewing sarcoma of the femoral diaphysis. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) defines a contiguous intramedullary primary lesion of length $L_1 = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of orthopedic oncology, well-posed with sufficient data, and objective in its language. We may proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the total length of a surgical resection for a bone tumor with a skip lesion. Let us define a one-dimensional coordinate system along the longitudinal axis of the femur to model the geometry of the resection. We can set the coordinate of the most proximal point of the primary lesion to be $x = 0$.\n\nThe givens are:\n- The length of the primary intramedullary lesion, $L_1 = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The length of the distal skip lesion, $L_2 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The length of the clear bone segment between the primary and skip lesions, $d = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- The required oncologic margin of normal bone, $m = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe primary lesion occupies the spatial interval from $x = 0$ to $x = L_1$.\nThe proximal extent of the primary lesion is at $x_{p,prox} = 0$.\nThe distal extent of the primary lesion is at $x_{p,dist} = L_1 = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe skip lesion is located distally to the primary lesion, separated by a gap of length $d$. Therefore, the proximal extent of the skip lesion is at a coordinate $d$ distal to the distal end of the primary lesion.\nThe proximal extent of the skip lesion is at $x_{s,prox} = x_{p,dist} + d = L_1 + d$.\nThe skip lesion has a length of $L_2$, so its distal extent is at $x_{s,dist} = x_{s,prox} + L_2 = (L_1 + d) + L_2$.\n\nTo plan the en bloc resection, we must first identify the total span of all tumorous tissue. This is the continuous segment of bone stretching from the most proximal point of any disease to the most distal point of any disease.\nThe most proximal extent of any disease is the proximal extent of the primary lesion: $x_{disease,prox} = x_{p,prox} = 0$.\nThe most distal extent of any disease is the distal extent of the skip lesion: $x_{disease,dist} = x_{s,dist} = L_1 + d + L_2$.\n\nThe total length of the bone segment containing all foci of disease, which we will denote as $L_{disease}$, is the difference between these two coordinates:\n$$L_{disease} = x_{disease,dist} - x_{disease,prox} = (L_{1} + d + L_{2}) - 0 = L_{1} + d + L_{2}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this expression:\n$$L_{disease} = 8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 13.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe surgical plan requires a uniform oncologic margin of $m = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ of normal bone both proximally and distally to the entire disease-containing region. This means we must resect an additional length $m$ of bone proximal to the most proximal point of disease, and an additional length $m$ of bone distal to the most distal point of disease.\n\nThe total length of the resection, $L_{resection}$, is therefore the length of the disease-containing segment plus the two margins:\n$$L_{resection} = m + L_{disease} + m = L_{disease} + 2m$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $L_{disease}$:\n$$L_{resection} = (L_{1} + d + L_{2}) + 2m$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for all variables:\n$$L_{resection} = (8.4\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 3.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 1.6\\,\\mathrm{cm}) + 2(2.0\\,\\mathrm{cm})$$\n$$L_{resection} = 13.0\\,\\mathrm{cm} + 4.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n$$L_{resection} = 17.0\\,\\mathrm{cm}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in centimeters and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $17.0$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $17.00$.",

            "solution": "The problem is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Total physical dose, $D_{tot} = 55.8 \\text{ Gy}$.\n- Dose per fraction, $d = 1.8 \\text{ Gy}$.\n- Treatment schedule assumptions: equal daily fractions, no gaps, complete sublethal damage repair between fractions, and no repopulation.\n- Cell survival model: Linear-quadratic (LQ) model, $S(d) = \\exp(-\\alpha d - \\beta d^2)$.\n- Definition of Biologically Effective Dose (BED): The reference dose $D_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ delivered with an infinitesimally small dose per fraction yielding the same total logarithmic cell kill.\n- Tissue-specific parameter: $\\alpha/\\beta = 10 \\text{ Gy}$ for Ewing sarcoma.\n- Task: Compute the BED in Gray (Gy).\n- Final Answer Precision: Round to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The linear-quadratic model is the standard framework in radiation biology for quantifying the effect of ionizing radiation on clonogenic cells. The concept of Biologically Effective Dose (BED) is a direct and widely used application of this model to compare different radiation therapy fractionation schedules. The specified parameters, including a total dose of $55.8 \\text{ Gy}$ delivered in $1.8 \\text{ Gy}$ fractions and an $\\alpha/\\beta$ ratio of $10 \\text{ Gy}$, are clinically realistic for the curative-intent treatment of certain tumors, including Ewing sarcoma. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and free from contradictions or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid and can be solved.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\nThe linear-quadratic (LQ) model describes the fraction of cells surviving a single dose $d$ of radiation as:\n$$S(d) = \\exp(-\\alpha d - \\beta d^2)$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are tissue-specific parameters representing the linear (single-hit) and quadratic (double-hit) components of cell killing, respectively.\n\nFor a course of radiotherapy consisting of $n$ identical fractions of dose $d$, assuming complete repair of sublethal damage between fractions, the total surviving fraction $S_{tot}$ is the product of the survival from each fraction:\n$$S_{tot} = [S(d)]^n = \\left[ \\exp(-\\alpha d - \\beta d^2) \\right]^n = \\exp[-n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)]$$\nThe total biological effect, $E$, is defined as the total log cell kill:\n$$E = -\\ln(S_{tot}) = n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)$$\nThe Biologically Effective Dose (BED) is defined as the total dose that would produce the same biological effect if delivered in a reference regimen of infinitely small dose fractions. In the limit as $d \\to 0$, the quadratic term $\\beta d^2$ becomes negligible compared to the linear term $\\alpha d$. The effect for such a reference treatment delivering a total dose, denoted as BED, is purely linear:\n$$E_{\\text{ref}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{BED}$$\nBy definition, the effect of the actual regimen must equal the effect of the reference regimen:\n$$E = E_{\\text{ref}}$$\n$$n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2) = \\alpha \\cdot \\text{BED}$$\nTo solve for BED, we can divide the entire equation by $\\alpha$:\n$$\\text{BED} = \\frac{n(\\alpha d + \\beta d^2)}{\\alpha} = n d \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} d\\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten using the clinically important ratio $\\alpha/\\beta$:\n$$\\text{BED} = n d \\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$$\nThe term $n \\cdot d$ is the total physical dose, $D_{tot}$. Therefore, the standard formula for BED is:\n$$\\text{BED} = D_{tot} \\left(1 + \\frac{d}{\\alpha/\\beta}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Total physical dose, $D_{tot} = 55.8 \\text{ Gy}$.\n- Dose per fraction, $d = 1.8 \\text{ Gy}$.\n- The alpha/beta ratio, $\\alpha/\\beta = 10 \\text{ Gy}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the BED formula:\n$$\\text{BED} = 55.8 \\text{ Gy} \\left(1 + \\frac{1.8 \\text{ Gy}}{10 \\text{ Gy}}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED} = 55.8 \\left(1 + 0.18\\right)$$\n$$\\text{BED} = 55.8 \\times 1.18$$\n$$\\text{BED} = 65.844 \\text{ Gy}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $65.844$. The first four significant figures are $6$, $5$, $8$, and $4$. The fifth digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down by keeping the fourth digit as it is.\nThus, the rounded BED is $65.84 \\text{ Gy}$.",
