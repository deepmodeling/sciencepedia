            "problem": "A $2$-month-old, $5$-$\\mathrm{kg}$ infant with severe viral bronchiolitis is endotracheally intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Shortly after intubation, oxygen saturation drops from $96\\%$ to $86\\%$ despite unchanged Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO$_2$). Auscultation suggests reduced breath sounds over the left anterior chest. The team performs Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) using a high-frequency linear transducer in the longitudinal plane at the second intercostal space, midclavicular line, bilaterally. On the right, pleural sliding is observed. On the left, pleural sliding is absent during several respiratory cycles. There is no subcutaneous emphysema. M-mode on the left demonstrates a static pattern consistent with a stratosphere/barcode sign rather than a seashore sign.\n\nThe clinician considers two competing mechanisms: right mainstem endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation versus a left-sided pneumothorax. The ETT tip is then withdrawn by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$ from its prior depth while ventilator settings are otherwise unchanged. The team plans to reassess pleural sliding bilaterally, scan for a lung point, and estimate aeration symmetry by comparing breath sound intensity and ventilator-derived tidal volume distribution proxies (for example, the relative amplitude of ventilator flow curves and chest wall expansion, assuming constant compliance).\n\nStarting from first principles, reason about the physical basis of pleural sliding, lung pulse, and ultrasound artifact generation in air-containing tissues and pleural interfaces, and about how ventilation distribution changes when an ETT selectively ventilates one mainstem bronchus versus when intrapleural air separates the visceral and parietal pleura. Then choose the single best option that predicts the constellation of ultrasound signs and aeration changes after ETT withdrawal that most strongly supports right mainstem intubation rather than pneumothorax.\n\nA. After ETT withdrawal by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$, left pleural sliding reappears with an M-mode seashore pattern; a subtle cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) had been present on the left when sliding was absent; no lung point is detected despite scanning the lateral and posterior chest; breath sounds and inferred aeration become more symmetric bilaterally.\n\nB. After ETT withdrawal by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$, left pleural sliding remains absent; there is no cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) on the left; a discrete lung point is identified in the midaxillary line; right pleural sliding is unchanged; aeration remains predominantly right-sided.\n\nC. Before ETT withdrawal, bilateral pleural sliding is absent but a cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) is seen on both sides; after ETT withdrawal, sliding reappears only on the right, and a lung point is identified on the left posterior chest.\n\nD.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a clinical scenario using first principles of physiology and ultrasound physics to differentiate between two potential causes of acute respiratory decompensation in a mechanically ventilated infant: right mainstem endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation and left-sided pneumothorax.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\n\n**1.1. Extraction of Givens**\n- **Patient**: A $2$-month-old, $5$-$\\mathrm{kg}$ infant.\n- **Clinical Context**: Severe viral bronchiolitis, endotracheally intubated, on mechanical ventilation.\n- **Acute Event**: Oxygen saturation drops from $96\\%$ to $86\\%$.\n- **Ventilator Settings**: Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) and Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO$_2$) are unchanged.\n- **Physical Examination**: Auscultation suggests reduced breath sounds over the left anterior chest.\n- **Initial Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) Findings**:\n    - Transducer: High-frequency linear.\n    - Location: Second intercostal space, midclavicular line, bilaterally.\n    - Right Chest: Pleural sliding is observed.\n    - Left Chest: Pleural sliding is absent; no subcutaneous emphysema.\n    - M-mode on the left: Demonstrates a static pattern consistent with a stratosphere/barcode sign.\n- **Differential Diagnosis**: Right mainstem ETT intubation vs. a left-sided pneumothorax.\n- **Intervention**: The ETT tip is withdrawn by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$.\n- **Planned Reassessment**: Reassess pleural sliding bilaterally, scan for a lung point, and estimate aeration symmetry.\n- **Question**: Identify the set of findings after ETT withdrawal that most strongly supports the diagnosis of right mainstem intubation over pneumothorax.\n\n**1.2. Validation Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of respiratory physiology, mechanical ventilation, and the physics of medical ultrasound. The clinical scenario, diagnostic tools (POCUS), specific ultrasound signs (pleural sliding, lung point, seashore/stratosphere signs, lung pulse), and the proposed intervention are standard and well-documented in critical care medicine.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It presents a common and critical diagnostic challenge with two competing hypotheses. It asks for the predicted outcome of a specific intervention that would logically distinguish between these two hypotheses. A unique, rational solution can be derived from first principles.\n- **Objective**: The description uses precise, objective medical terminology. The data (e.g., O$_2$ saturation values, physical findings, ultrasound signs) are presented factually, without subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is free from the flaws listed in the instructions. It represents a valid and non-trivial reasoning problem grounded in biophysics and physiology. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution from First Principles\n\n**2.1. Physical and Physiological Principles**\n- **Pleural Interface and Sliding**: The lungs are covered by the visceral pleura, and the inner chest wall is lined by the parietal pleura. Normally, these two membranes are in direct contact, separated only by a thin layer of fluid. During respiration, lung inflation and deflation cause the visceral pleura to move relative to the static parietal pleura. Ultrasound visualizes this movement as a shimmering line called \"pleural sliding\".\n- **Ultrasound Artifacts**:\n    - **Seashore Sign (M-mode)**: In a normally aerated lung with pleural sliding, an M-mode trace through the pleura shows static, linear \"waves\" from the chest wall and a granular, sandy \"shore\" from the moving lung parenchyma below the bright pleural line.\n    - **Stratosphere/Barcode Sign (M-mode)**: If there is no motion at or below the pleural line, the M-mode trace consists of parallel horizontal lines, as static tissue structures are recorded over time. This sign indicates the absence of pleural sliding.\n- **Pathophysiology of Absent Pleural Sliding**:\n    1.  **Pneumothorax**: Air in the pleural space separates the visceral and parietal pleurae. The ultrasound beam reflects off the stationary parietal pleura and the intrapleural air. It does not reach the visceral pleura. Since there is no apposition and the reflecting surface is static, sliding is absent. This results in a stratosphere sign.\n    2.  **Selective Mainstem Intubation**: If the ETT tip is advanced past the carina into one mainstem bronchus (typically the right, due to its less acute angle), the contralateral lung (in this case, the left) is not ventilated. The unventilated lung becomes atelectatic (collapses due to gas absorption) and does not move with the respiratory cycle. Although the visceral and parietal pleurae remain in apposition, there is no ventilation-induced movement between them. This also results in absent pleural sliding and a stratosphere sign.\n- **Differentiating Signs**:\n    1.  **Lung Point**: This sign is the dynamic visualization of the edge of a pneumothorax. It is the point on the chest wall where, during the respiratory cycle, the lung intermittently expands to touch the chest wall (showing sliding) and then retracts (showing no sliding). The presence of a lung point is $100\\%$ specific (pathognomonic) for pneumothorax. It cannot occur if the pleurae are in apposition everywhere, as in atelectasis.\n    2.  **Lung Pulse**: In an unventilated but apposed lung (e.g., atelectasis from mainstem intubation), the rhythmic pulsation of the heart is transmitted to the lung, causing a subtle, cardiac-synchronous sliding of the pleurae. This \"lung pulse\" confirms that the visceral and parietal pleurae are touching. Therefore, the presence of a lung pulse in an area with absent respiratory sliding effectively rules out pneumothorax at that location.\n\n**2.2. Analysis of the Scenario**\nThe initial state (unilateral absent sliding on the left, present sliding on the right, and acute desaturation) is consistent with both a left pneumothorax and a right mainstem intubation. The intervention—withdrawing the ETT by $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$—is designed to reposition the ETT tip above the carina.\n\n- **Hypothesis 1: The cause is right mainstem intubation.**\n    - **Before intervention**: The left lung is unventilated (atelectatic). The pleurae are in apposition but do not slide with respiration. A lung pulse *would be present* on the left due to cardiac transmissions.\n    - **After intervention (withdrawal of ETT)**: The ETT is now in the trachea. Ventilation is restored to both lungs.\n    - **Predicted Findings**: The left lung re-inflates with each breath. This restores the relative motion between the pleurae. Therefore, left pleural sliding will reappear, and the M-mode pattern will convert from a stratosphere sign to a seashore sign. Since there was never a pneumothorax, a lung point will not be found. Clinically, breath sounds will improve on the left, and aeration will become symmetric.\n\n- **Hypothesis 2: The cause is a left pneumothorax.**\n    - **Before intervention**: Air separates the left visceral and parietal pleurae. Sliding is absent. Because the pleurae are not in contact, a lung pulse *will be absent*. A lung point *should be present* somewhere on the chest wall periphery.\n    - **After intervention (withdrawal of ETT)**: Repositioning the ETT does not treat the pneumothorax. The air remains in the pleural space.\n    - **Predicted Findings**: The physical separation of the pleural membranes persists. Left pleural sliding will remain absent. The stratosphere sign will persist. There will still be no lung pulse. A lung point will still be discoverable. Aeration will remain predominantly on the right.\n\nThe question asks for the findings that support **right mainstem intubation**. This matches the predictions for Hypothesis 1.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. After ETT withdrawal by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$, left pleural sliding reappears with an M-mode seashore pattern; a subtle cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) had been present on the left when sliding was absent; no lung point is detected despite scanning the lateral and posterior chest; breath sounds and inferred aeration become more symmetric bilaterally.**\n    - This option perfectly describes the resolution of a right mainstem intubation. The return of sliding is the key consequence of restoring ventilation. The mention of the pre-existing lung pulse is a critical, high-level observation that confirms pleural apposition during the atelectatic phase, and the absence of a lung point definitively rules out pneumothorax. The clinical improvement in aeration is the expected outcome.\n    - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. After ETT withdrawal by approximately $1$-$\\mathrm{cm}$, left pleural sliding remains absent; there is no cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) on the left; a discrete lung point is identified in the midaxillary line; right pleural sliding is unchanged; aeration remains predominantly right-sided.**\n    - This option describes the findings of a persistent left pneumothorax that is unresponsive to ETT repositioning. The key signs are continued absence of sliding, absence of a lung pulse, and the identification of a pathognomonic lung point.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.** This supports the diagnosis of pneumothorax, not mainstem intubation.\n\n- **C. Before ETT withdrawal, bilateral pleural sliding is absent but a cardiogenic pleural motion (lung pulse) is seen on both sides; after ETT withdrawal, sliding reappears only on the right, and a lung point is identified on the left posterior chest.**\n    - The initial condition of \"bilateral pleural sliding is absent\" contradicts the problem statement, which explicitly states that right-sided pleural sliding was observed. Furthermore, the outcome of identifying a lung point on the left is indicative of pneumothorax, not mainstem intubation. The entire option is internally and externally inconsistent.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. Before ETT withdrawal, left pleural sliding is present with numerous vertical artifacts (B-lines) and right pleural sliding is absent; after ETT withdrawal, left sliding disappears and a lung point emerges on the right, with aeration shifting toward the left.**\n    - The initial condition described (\"left pleural sliding is present... and right pleural sliding is absent\") is the exact opposite of what is stated in the problem stem. The subsequent events are also illogical in the context of correcting a *right* mainstem intubation.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only one that describes the correct constellation of ultrasound and clinical findings confirming that the initial problem was a right mainstem intubation that was successfully corrected by withdrawing the ETT.",

You are asked to develop a strategy to distinguish a drainage system air leak from a patient-source leak such as a bronchopleural fistula (BPF), and to propose appropriate initial diagnostic steps in a pediatric patient.\n\nUse fundamental principles of fluid mechanics and respiratory physiology as the base: airflow $Q$ occurs when there is a pressure gradient, $Q \\propto \\Delta P / R$, where $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the conduit and $R$ is resistance; in positive pressure ventilation, alveolar pressure $P_{\\mathrm{alv}}$ rises during inspiration, pleural pressure $P_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ depends on lung and chest wall mechanics, and the water seal provides a one-way escape path for gas when $P_{\\mathrm{pleural}}$ exceeds the hydrostatic barrier and/or when suction lowers downstream pressure. Bubbling in the water-seal chamber signifies gas entering the column, either from the pleural space via the chest tube (patient-source) or from ambient air entrained through a defect in the drainage circuit (system-source).\n\nWhich of the following strategies are scientifically justified and safe initial steps to differentiate a system leak from a patient-source leak and to pursue diagnosis in a pediatric patient?

The principles and proposed actions are verifiable within medical science.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by evaluating each option.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to differentiate a patient-source air leak from a system-source air leak. A patient-source leak (e.g., a bronchopleural fistula, BPF) allows air to travel from the airway to the pleural space, driven by the pressure gradient between them. In a patient on positive pressure ventilation, this pressure gradient is largest during inspiration, when alveolar pressure ($P_{\\mathrm{alv}}$) peaks. For this patient, peak inspiratory pressure is $18$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ (inspiratory pressure) + $5$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ (PEEP) = $23$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$. Therefore, a BPF leak is typically phasic, occurring or increasing with inspiration.\n\nA system-source leak occurs when a defect in the drainage circuit (tubing, connectors) allows ambient air to be entrained. This is driven by the pressure gradient between the atmosphere (pressure $\\approx 0$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$) and the inside of the circuit, which is held at a negative pressure by the suction ($-20$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$). This creates a constant pressure gradient of approximately $20$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$, resulting in *continuous* bubbling that is independent of the patient's respiratory cycle. The report of \"persistent, continuous bubbling\" strongly suggests a system leak, but a very large BPF cannot be entirely ruled out by this observation alone. Each option must be evaluated as a diagnostic step.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Perform a deliberate, brief clamp test, starting with a clamp placed on the chest tube near the chest wall for $\\leq 10$ $\\mathrm{s}$ while continuously observing the water-seal chamber. If bubbling stops when clamped proximally, suspect a patient-source leak (e.g., BPF or malposition with side holes outside the pleural cavity). If bubbling persists, move the clamp distally segment by segment to localize a system leak; replace or tighten the leaking component once identified.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This procedure methodically isolates segments of the air-path. Clamping the tube near the patient's chest wall separates the patient from the drainage system.\n    - If bubbling stops, the air source must be proximal to the clamp (i.e., the patient). This is a valid conclusion.\n    - If bubbling continues, the leak must be distal to the clamp (i.e., in the tubing or a connector).\n- The strategy of moving the clamp distally (\"walking the clamp\") is a logical process of elimination to pinpoint the exact location of a system leak.\n- **Safety:** Clamping a chest tube in a patient with an active air leak risks causing a tension pneumothorax. The proposal specifies a *brief* clamp time ($\\leq 10$ $\\mathrm{s}$) with continuous observation, which is the standard, accepted protocol for performing this maneuver safely. This mitigates the risk to an acceptable level for a critical diagnostic test.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This is a scientifically sound, systematic, and standard clinical procedure for differentiating and locating an air leak, with appropriate safety considerations explicitly stated.\n\n**B. Immediately increase suction from $-20$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ to $-40$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ to overcome the leak, thereby reducing bubbling and diagnosing the problem by response to stronger suction.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This proposal is based on flawed physical reasoning. According to the principle $Q \\propto \\Delta P / R$, increasing the suction from $-20$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ to $-40$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ will increase the magnitude of the pressure gradient ($\\Delta P$) for both types of leaks.\n    - For a system leak, $\\Delta P$ between ambient ($0$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$) and the system interior would increase from $\\approx 20$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ to $\\approx 40$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$, thus *increasing* airflow and making the bubbling *worse*.\n    - For a patient-source leak (BPF), increasing suction lowers pleural pressure, which increases the pressure gradient from the airway to the pleura, thereby increasing the size of the air leak. This can also impede the natural healing of the fistula.\n- In no scenario would increasing suction \"overcome the leak\" or \"reduce bubbling\".\n- **Safety:** This action is not only diagnostically useless but also potentially harmful, as it can worsen the air leak and cause parenchymal damage.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This strategy is based on incorrect scientific principles and is unsafe.\n\n**C. Occlude the chest tube completely for $30$ $\\mathrm{min}$ to see if the bubbling resolves, then reopen; if the bubbling stops, the source was likely systemic.**\n\n- **Analysis:** The logic is nonsensical. Bubbling will cease immediately upon clamping, regardless of the leak's source, because the path for air to reach the water-seal chamber is blocked. The observation provides no diagnostic information.\n- **Safety:** This is extremely dangerous. Occluding a chest tube for $30$ minutes in a mechanically ventilated patient with a known air leak is a direct cause of tension pneumothorax, a life-threatening medical emergency. The accumulating air in the pleural space cannot escape, leading to lung collapse, mediastinal shift, and cardiovascular collapse.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The procedure is both diagnostically invalid and critically unsafe.\n\n**D. Determine bubble timing relative to the ventilatory cycle: in a mechanically ventilated patient, inspiration-synchronous bubbling suggests an airway-to-pleural communication such as a BPF. Use an inspiratory hold maneuver for $2$–$3$ $\\mathrm{s}$ while watching the seal and, if the child remains stable, proceed to flexible bronchoscopy to localize a suspected fistula.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This describes a logical, stepwise diagnostic pathway.\n    - Observing the timing of the bubbles is a fundamental, non-invasive first step. As analyzed, inspiratory-phasic bubbling points to a patient-source (BPF) leak, while continuous bubbling suggests a system leak.\n    - An inspiratory hold maneuver maintains peak airway pressure, which should sustain the air leak if it is a BPF, providing further evidence.\n    - If a BPF is strongly suspected based on these non-invasive tests, flexible bronchoscopy is the definitive diagnostic procedure to confirm its presence, identify its location, and plan further management.\n- **Safety:** Observing the system and performing a brief inspiratory hold are completely safe. Proceeding to bronchoscopy is an appropriate escalation in the diagnostic algorithm if a BPF is the leading diagnosis.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This represents a scientifically sound, safe, and clinically standard approach to diagnosing a BPF.\n\n**E. Temporarily disconnect regulated suction and leave the system to water seal alone for $10$–$20$ $\\mathrm{s}$ under close monitoring. If bubbling disappears only when suction is off but resumes with suction, suspect a leak along the suction regulator or tubing; replace the regulator/tubing and retest.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This maneuver isolates the effect of suction. A system leak is often driven by the negative pressure from suction pulling in ambient air. Removing the suction eliminates this pressure gradient.\n    - If bubbling stops when suction is off, it strongly implies the leak is in the suction apparatus or associated tubing and is dependent on the negative pressure.\n    - If bubbling continues (even if reduced), it confirms that there is a positive pressure source pushing air out, i.e., the patient's ventilated lung ($P_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ > water seal pressure during inspiration). The PEEP of $5$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ and peak pressure of $23$ $\\mathrm{cm\\,H_2O}$ make it likely that a patient-source leak would continue to bubble on water seal alone.\n- **Safety:** This is a brief, simple, non-invasive, and safe test performed under close observation.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This is an excellent, safe, and simple initial test to perform at the bedside to check for a common type of system leak.\n\n**F. Obtain an immediate chest radiograph (CXR) to confirm intrathoracic position of the tube and to evaluate for tube malposition (e.g., side holes at or outside the chest wall), then inspect and reinforce the insertion-site dressing and all connections; reposition or replace the chest tube if malposition is identified.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option addresses two of the most common and easily fixable causes of a persistent air leak.\n    - **CXR for Malposition:** The side ports (sentinel holes) on a chest tube must be fully inside the pleural space. If a port is outside the chest wall or in the subcutaneous tissue, it can entrain atmospheric air, perfectly mimicking a system leak. A CXR is the standard method to verify tube position.\n    - **Inspect Connections:** Loose connections between the chest tube and the drainage tubing, or between the tubing and the collection chamber, are the single most common cause of a system leak. A thorough \"hands-on\" inspection and tightening of all connections is a fundamental first step.\n- **Safety:** These actions are standard care, non-invasive (inspection) or minimally invasive (CXR), and entirely safe. They are essential parts of troubleshooting any chest tube problem.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**. This combines two fundamental, safe, and high-yield initial diagnostic steps.\n\n### Summary of Correct Options\nOptions A, D, E, and F describe scientifically justified, safe, and standard procedures for diagnosing the cause of an air leak in this clinical context.

Use the following foundational definitions:\n- The allowable drug mass equals the allowable mass per unit body mass multiplied by body mass.\n- A $1\\%$ weight/volume solution contains $1\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of solute per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of solution.\n- Solution concentration equals solute mass divided by solution volume.\nStarting strictly from these definitions, compute the safe maximum mass of lidocaine for this child and the corresponding volume of the $1\\%$ solution needed to deliver that mass. Round your final numerical results to three significant figures. Express the mass in $\\mathrm{mg}$ and the volume in $\\mathrm{mL}$.",
            "solution": "The task is to determine the safe maximum mass of lidocaine and then convert this mass to a volume of a given solution using core definitions. Let the child’s body mass be $m$, the baseline ceiling dose per unit mass be $d_{0}$, and the institutional safety factor be $s$. The allowable mass $D_{\\max}$ follows from the definition that allowable drug mass is the allowable mass per unit body mass multiplied by body mass, modified by the safety factor to reflect increased susceptibility:\n$$\nD_{\\max} = s \\, d_{0} \\, m.\n$$\nWe are given $m = 12\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $d_{0} = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$, and $s = 0.80$. Substituting,\n$$\nD_{\\max} = 0.80 \\times 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg} \\times 12\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 0.80 \\times 54\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 43.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}.\n$$\nNext, we translate the $1\\%$ solution into a concentration using the definition of percentage weight/volume. A $1\\%$ solution contains $1\\,\\mathrm{g}$ per $100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. Converting grams to milligrams gives $1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, so\n$$\nC = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{mL}.\n$$\nUsing the definition of concentration $C$ as solute mass divided by solution volume, the required volume $V_{\\max}$ to deliver the mass $D_{\\max}$ is\n$$\nV_{\\max} = \\frac{D_{\\max}}{C} = \\frac{43.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{10\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{mL}} = 4.32\\,\\mathrm{mL}.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the mass $43.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and the volume $4.32\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ are already in the requested precision. Therefore, the safe maximum mass is $43.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and the corresponding volume of $1\\%$ lidocaine is $4.32\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.",
