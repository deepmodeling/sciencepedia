            "problem": "A pediatric primary care clinic implementing trauma-informed care for adolescents plans universal screening for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) using a validated tool. Let $p$ denote the prevalence of probable PTSD in the screened population, $Se$ denote the sensitivity (the probability the test is positive given PTSD is present), and $Sp$ denote the specificity (the probability the test is negative given PTSD is absent). Starting from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes' theorem, derive analytic expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) as functions of $p$, $Se$, and $Sp$. Then evaluate these expressions for $p=0.10$, $Se=0.85$, and $Sp=0.90$. Express $PPV$ and $NPV$ as decimal fractions and round your numerical answers to four significant figures.\n\nIn addition, in the context of trauma-informed pediatric practice, interpret the computed $PPV$ and $NPV$ to estimate follow-up needs and potential resource implications if $N=1000$ adolescents are screened in a typical month. Your interpretation should be grounded in the definitions and the derived expressions, identifying the expected counts of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives, and discussing how these quantities inform planning for confirmatory assessment, immediate supportive interventions, and referral capacity. Only the numerical values for $PPV$ and $NPV$ will be graded for the final answer; the interpretation is required for full credit on the solution.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is a well-posed problem in applied probability and biostatistics, using standard, clearly defined terms (prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV) and providing a complete set of parameters. The scenario is scientifically grounded and the data are plausible for a clinical screening setting. The task is to derive and apply fundamental formulas from first principles, which is an objective and verifiable process.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that an adolescent has probable Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and let $D^c$ be the complementary event that the adolescent does not have PTSD. Let $T^+$ be the event of a positive test result and $T^-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given parameters can be expressed as conditional probabilities:\n- Prevalence, $p = P(D) = 0.10$. The probability of not having PTSD is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90$.\n- Sensitivity, $Se = P(T^+|D) = 0.85$. This is the probability of a positive test given the presence of PTSD. The probability of a false negative is $P(T^-|D) = 1 - Se = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n- Specificity, $Sp = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a negative test given the absence of PTSD. The probability of a false positive is $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - Sp = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe goal is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n- PPV is the probability that an adolescent has PTSD given a positive test result, i.e., $PPV = P(D|T^+)$.\n- NPV is the probability that an adolescent does not have PTSD given a negative test result, i.e., $NPV = P(D^c|T^-)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states that for events $A$ and $B$, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nUsing Bayes' theorem, the PPV is:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nTo find the denominator, $P(T^+)$, we use the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$$P(T^+) = (Se \\cdot p) + ((1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p))$$\nNow, substituting this back into the PPV expression gives the general analytic formula:\n$$PPV = \\frac{Se \\cdot p}{Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)(1-p)}$$\nEvaluating for the given numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.85 \\cdot 0.10}{0.85 \\cdot 0.10 + (1-0.90)(1-0.10)} = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + (0.10)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.090} = \\frac{0.085}{0.175}$$\n$$PPV \\approx 0.485714...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $PPV = 0.4857$.\n\n**Derivation of the Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nSimilarly, using Bayes' theorem for the NPV:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nUsing the law of total probability for the denominator, $P(T^-)$:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D)$$\nSubstituting the defined terms:\n$$P(T^-) = (Sp \\cdot (1-p)) + ((1-Se) \\cdot p)$$\nSubstituting this back into the NPV expression gives the general analytic formula:\n$$NPV = \\frac{Sp \\cdot (1-p)}{Sp \\cdot (1-p) + (1-Se)p}$$\nEvaluating for the given numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot (1-0.10)}{0.90 \\cdot (1-0.10) + (1-0.85)(0.10)} = \\frac{0.90 \\cdot 0.90}{0.90 \\cdot 0.90 + (0.15)(0.10)} = \\frac{0.81}{0.81 + 0.015} = \\frac{0.81}{0.825}$$\n$$NPV \\approx 0.981818...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9818$.\n\n**Interpretation for a cohort of $N=1000$ adolescents:**\nGiven a screening cohort of $N=1000$ adolescents and a prevalence $p=0.10$, we expect:\n- Number of adolescents with PTSD: $N \\cdot p = 1000 \\cdot 0.10 = 100$.\n- Number of adolescents without PTSD: $N \\cdot (1-p) = 1000 \\cdot 0.90 = 900$.\n\nWe can now calculate the expected counts for the four possible outcomes:\n- **True Positives (TP):** Adolescents with PTSD who test positive.\n  $TP = (\\text{Number with PTSD}) \\times Se = 100 \\times 0.85 = 85$.\n- **False Negatives (FN):** Adolescents with PTSD who test negative.\n  $FN = (\\text{Number with PTSD}) \\times (1-Se) = 100 \\times 0.15 = 15$.\n- **True Negatives (TN):** Adolescents without PTSD who test negative.\n  $TN = (\\text{Number without PTSD}) \\times Sp = 900 \\times 0.90 = 810$.\n- **False Positives (FP):** Adolescents without PTSD who test positive.\n  $FP = (\\text{Number without PTSD}) \\times (1-Sp) = 900 \\times 0.10 = 90$.\n\nTotal positive tests = $TP + FP = 85 + 90 = 175$.\nTotal negative tests = $TN + FN = 810 + 15 = 825$.\n\nThe calculated PPV and NPV can be confirmed with these counts:\n$PPV = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP} = \\frac{85}{175} \\approx 0.4857$.\n$NPV = \\frac{TN}{TN+FN} = \\frac{810}{825} \\approx 0.9818$.\n\n**Resource Implications and Interpretation in Practice:**\nA $PPV$ of $0.4857$ means that for every adolescent who tests positive, there is a $48.57\\%$ chance they actually have PTSD. Conversely, there is a $51.43\\%$ chance they do not. In the cohort of $1000$, the $175$ positive screens consist of $85$ true positives and $90$ false positives.\n- **Resource Implication:** A positive screen is not a diagnosis. All $175$ adolescents with positive results must undergo a full, resource-intensive confirmatory diagnostic assessment. This means the clinic must have the capacity for approximately $175$ diagnostic workups per month for this program. A significant portion of these resources ($90$ out of $175$, or about $51\\%$) will be allocated to individuals who are ultimately found not to have PTSD. This highlights the inefficiency of the screen in isolation but underscores its role in case-finding. Immediate supportive interventions, such as psychoeducation and safety planning, might be offered to all $175$ individuals pending diagnostic confirmation, which also requires clinical resources.\n\nAn $NPV$ of $0.9818$ means that for every adolescent who tests negative, there is a $98.18\\%$ chance they truly do not have PTSD.\n- **Resource Implication:** A negative result is a strong indicator of the absence of PTSD, providing a high degree of confidence and allowing clinical resources to be focused elsewhere. Out of the $825$ negative screens, $810$ are true negatives. However, the $15$ false negatives represent adolescents with probable PTSD who are missed by the screening tool. In a trauma-informed care model, this is a critical failure. It mandates that clinical judgment must be empowered to override a negative screen. If a clinician has other reasons for concern (e.g., from clinical history, observation, or family report), they should still be able to refer the adolescent for a full assessment. The existence of these $15$ missed cases per $1000$ screened adolescents reinforces that no screening tool is perfect and that a safety net based on clinical expertise is essential.\n\nIn summary, the screening tool is effective at ruling out PTSD (high NPV) but less effective at confirming it (modest PPV). The program will require substantial resources for follow-up on positive screens, and a robust clinical protocol is necessary to manage the significant number of false positives and mitigate the risk of harm from the small but important number of false negatives.",

The caregiver (biological mother) recently re-established custody and reports high motivation to engage but has night-shift work and childcare constraints that limit attendance to every $2$ weeks for $60$-minute sessions.

The validation will proceed based on the standards of this field.\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in established principles of developmental psychology, trauma-informed care, and evidence-based psychotherapy. The presenting symptoms are consistent with trauma exposure in early childhood. The therapeutic modalities mentioned, Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) and Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), are well-established, empirically supported treatments. The SAMHSA principles cited are the standard of care in trauma-informed systems. The scenario is entirely scientifically and clinically realistic.\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It presents a set of constraints (patient needs, family capacity, clinic resources) and asks for the optimal solution from a given set of choices. The information provided is sufficient to logically deduce a single best course of action based on clinical best practices and model requirements.\n*   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and free of subjective or biased statements. It describes a scenario and asks for a logical deduction based on the provided facts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-structured, scientifically sound problem in an applied STEM field. The solution process can now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to select the intervention that best fits the multifaceted requirements detailed in the problem. The analysis will systematically evaluate each option against the family's needs, the caregiver's capacity, and the clinic's resources/constraints.\n\nThe central constraints are:\n1.  **Trauma Focus:** The family explicitly wants to process the child's trauma.\n2.  **Dyadic/Attachment Focus:** The goals center on strengthening the parent-child relationship and co-regulation.\n3.  **Scheduling:** The caregiver can only attend every $2$ weeks for $60$ minutes.\n4.  **Personnel:** The clinic has a CPP-certified therapist but **no PCIT-certified therapist**.\n5.  **Equipment:** The clinic lacks the specialized equipment (one-way mirror, audio coaching devices) typically required for high-fidelity PCIT.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Initiate Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) focused on Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) with monthly sessions, using in-room coaching without specialized equipment, prioritizing externalizing symptom reduction over trauma processing to fit the caregiver’s limited attendance.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option has several critical failings. First and foremost, the clinic has **no staff certified in PCIT**, making its delivery impossible from the outset. Ethical and evidence-based practice requires that such specific protocols be delivered by trained and certified providers. Second, PCIT's standard protocol involves weekly sessions; the proposed *monthly* frequency is a significant deviation that would severely compromise its effectiveness and is even less frequent than the caregiver's stated availability. Third, PCIT relies heavily on live coaching with specialized equipment to be delivered with fidelity; \"in-room coaching\" is a major modification that alters the therapeutic dynamic. Finally, explicitly prioritizing behavior management *over* trauma processing contradicts a primary, stated goal of the family.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is infeasible due to lack of certified staff, violates model fidelity, and is misaligned with family goals.\n\n**B. Initiate Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP) with dyadic sessions and caregiver participation, integrating a developmentally appropriate trauma narrative, co-regulation and attachment goals, bilingual delivery, and flexible pacing matched to every $2$-week $60$-minute visits, leveraging the clinic’s trained CPP therapist and minimal equipment needs.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option aligns perfectly with all the given parameters. The clinic has a **bilingual, CPP-certified therapist**. CPP is an attachment-based, dyadic intervention specifically designed for children aged $0$-$5$ who have experienced trauma. It directly addresses the family's goals of strengthening attachment, improving co-regulation, and processing trauma through a \"developmentally appropriate trauma narrative.\" CPP is inherently flexible in its pacing and does not require specialized equipment, making it a perfect fit for the clinic's resources and the caregiver's bi-weekly, $60$-minute availability. It is collaborative by design, honoring the caregiver's voice and context, which aligns with SAMHSA principles of empowerment and cultural considerations.\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option is the only one that leverages available expertise and resources to meet all stated family goals within the existing constraints.\n\n**C. Begin Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) by conducting therapist-only sessions to train parent skills without the child present until the caregiver’s schedule permits weekly attendance, deferring dyadic live coaching until resources improve.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is fundamentally flawed. As established, the clinic has **no staff certified in PCIT**. Furthermore, conducting \"therapist-only sessions\" to train skills without the child is not PCIT; it is a form of parent management training (PMT). PCIT is defined by the live coaching of the parent-child dyad. This option proposes not doing the actual therapy. It also defers the core intervention until an indefinite future time, failing to address the family's immediate needs as requested by the prompt (\"determine the most appropriate intervention choice now\").\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option proposes a therapy the clinic cannot offer, mischaracterizes the nature of that therapy, and inappropriately delays treatment.\n\n**D. Refer for individual play therapy for the child only to avoid caregiver scheduling barriers and reduce the risk of discussing trauma prematurely; reintroduce caregiver later if behavior does not improve.**\n\n*   **Analysis:** This option is contraindicated by the case presentation. The child's trauma occurred within a relational context (family violence), and the presenting symptoms include separation anxiety, indicating attachment-related distress. Best practice for young children ($4$ years old) with this profile is a dyadic approach that utilizes the caregiver-child relationship as the primary vehicle for healing. Separating the dyad by placing the child in individual therapy works against the explicit goals of strengthening attachment and co-regulation. It disempowers the highly motivated caregiver, violating a core principle of trauma-informed care (collaboration and mutuality). The rationale of avoiding premature trauma discussion is misguided, as a skilled dyadic therapist (like the available CPP therapist) is trained to pace this safely with the caregiver as a partner.\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is clinically inappropriate for the child's age and presenting problems, and it fails to align with the stated family goals and evidence-based practices for early childhood trauma.",

The clinic uses a validated screening tool whose operating characteristics in this population are sensitivity $Se = 0.80$, specificity $Sp = 0.90$, and estimated population prevalence $p = 0.15$ for clinically significant trauma exposure that would warrant immediate linkage to trauma-focused services. The clinic sees $N = 1000$ visits per month and currently has capacity for $K = 120$ immediate linkages to trauma-informed follow-up services per month.\n\nConsistent with the ethical principles of trauma-informed care (safety, trustworthiness, choice, collaboration, empowerment), the clinic’s policy requires that disclosures not occur without timely support. Concretely, they stipulate a minimum linkage rate: at least $\\lambda = 0.75$ of children with positive screens must be linked to appropriate services within $2$ weeks to avoid avoidable harm from disclosure without support. The clinic further quantifies expected benefit and harm to inform decisions: each true positive who receives timely linkage yields a benefit of $b_t = 5$ (arbitrary utility units), each true positive who is not timely linked incurs a net harm of $h_u = 2$, and each false positive incurs distress and labeling harm of $h_f = 1$.\n\nAssume standard definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) and apply Bayes’ rule to relate them to prevalence.

The logic is verifiable through mathematical derivation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Criterion\n\nA principled and ethically sound criterion must incorporate all the constraints and factors provided in the problem statement. The decision to implement screening should be subject to two main conditions:\n1.  Adherence to the clinic's explicit ethical policy regarding disclosure and support.\n2.  A positive net expected utility (i.e., benefits outweigh harms).\n\n**1. The Safety-Capacity Constraint**\n\nThe clinic's policy requires that \"at least $\\lambda = 0.75$ of children with positive screens must be linked to appropriate services.\" This is a primary, non-negotiable constraint.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of expected positive screens per month, $N_{T^+}$.\n-   The number of true positives (TP) is $N_{TP} = N \\cdot p \\cdot Se$.\n-   The number of false positives (FP) is $N_{FP} = N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$.\n-   Total positives: $N_{T^+} = N_{TP} + N_{FP} = N \\left( p \\cdot Se + (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp) \\right)$.\n\nThe clinic has a capacity of $K$ linkage slots. The number of positive-screened children who can actually be linked is $\\min(K, N_{T^+})$.\nThe fraction of positives who are linked, which we denote as $\\phi$, is therefore:\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{\\min(K, N_{T^+})}{N_{T^+}} = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{K}{N_{T^+}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{T^+}$:\n$$ \\phi = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{K}{N \\left( Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp) \\cdot (1-p) \\right)}\\right) $$\nThe ethical policy constraint is that this fraction must be at least $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\phi \\ge \\lambda $$\nThis is the first component of a valid decision criterion.\n\n**2. The Net Expected Utility Constraint**\n\nBeyond meeting the policy constraint, the program should result in a net benefit. We construct a total utility function $U$ based on the given benefits and harms for the entire cohort of $N$ individuals.\n-   **Benefit from True Positives:** The benefit $b_t$ applies only to true positives who are timely linked. The total number of TPs is $N_{TP} = N \\cdot Se \\cdot p$. A reasonable model, as is standard in decision analysis, is to assume that the most valuable outcomes (linking a true positive) are prioritized. Thus, linked TPs are the minimum of the available slots, $K$, and the number of TPs, $N_{TP}$. Total benefit = $b_t \\cdot \\min(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p)$.\n-   **Harm from Unlinked True Positives:** The harm $h_u$ applies to TPs who are not linked. This occurs when the number of TPs exceeds the capacity $K$. The number of unlinked TPs is $\\max(0, N_{TP} - K)$. Total harm from unlinked TPs = $h_u \\cdot \\max(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K)$.\n-   **Harm from False Positives:** The harm $h_f$ applies to each false positive. The total number of FPs is $N_{FP} = N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$. Total harm from FPs = $h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp)$.\n\nThe net utility $U$ is the sum of benefits minus the sum of harms:\n$$ U = b_t \\cdot \\min(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p) - h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-p) \\cdot (1-Sp) - h_u \\cdot \\max(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K) $$\nFor the program to be ethically justifiable on a utilitarian basis, the net utility should be non-negative:\n$$ U \\ge 0 $$\nThis is the second component of a valid decision criterion.\n\n**Combined Criterion:**\nThe most appropriate criterion is to implement screening if and only if both the safety-capacity constraint and the net utility constraint are met.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nLet's calculate the numerical values based on the givens:\n-   $N=1000$, $p=0.15$, $Se=0.80$, $Sp=0.90$, $K=120$, $\\lambda=0.75$.\n-   $N_{TP} = 1000 \\cdot 0.15 \\cdot 0.80 = 120$.\n-   $N_{FP} = 1000 \\cdot (1-0.15) \\cdot (1-0.90) = 1000 \\cdot 0.85 \\cdot 0.10 = 85$.\n-   Total positives $N_{T^+} = 120 + 85 = 205$.\n-   Positive Predictive Value $PPV = \\frac{N_{TP}}{N_{T^+}} = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$.\n-   Fraction of positives linked $\\phi = \\frac{K}{N_{T^+}} = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$.\n\n**A. Implement if $PPV \\ge 0.50$, because at least half of positives would be true positives, which meets a reasonable threshold and makes downstream harms acceptable irrespective of capacity.**\n-   Analysis: This criterion suggests implementation since $PPV \\approx 0.585 \\ge 0.50$. However, it explicitly states to ignore capacity (\"irrespective of capacity\"). This directly contradicts the problem's ethical requirement that disclosure must be accompanied by timely support, which is formalized by the constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$. In this case, $\\phi \\approx 0.585$, which is less than $\\lambda = 0.75$. Therefore, this criterion is ethically incomplete as it violates a stated policy.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Implement only if both the safety-capacity constraint and net expected utility are satisfied, namely: the timely linkage fraction for positives $\\phi = \\min\\!\\left(1, \\dfrac{K}{N\\left(Se \\cdot p + (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)\\right)}\\right) \\ge \\lambda$, and the net utility $U = b_t \\cdot \\min\\!\\left(K, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p\\right) - h_f \\cdot N \\cdot (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p) - h_u \\cdot \\max\\!\\left(0, N \\cdot Se \\cdot p - K\\right) \\ge 0$.**\n-   Analysis: This option presents a two-part criterion that perfectly matches the one derived from first principles. It correctly formalizes both the safety-capacity constraint and the net utility constraint, integrating all relevant variables ($Se, Sp, p, K, N, \\lambda, b_t, h_u, h_f$).\n    -   Constraint 1 (Safety): $\\phi = \\frac{120}{205} \\approx 0.585$. The condition $\\phi \\ge 0.75$ is not met.\n    -   Constraint 2 (Utility): Using $b_t=5, h_u=2, h_f=1$:\n        $U = 5 \\cdot \\min(120, 120) - 1 \\cdot 85 - 2 \\cdot \\max(0, 120 - 120) = 5 \\cdot 120 - 85 - 0 = 600 - 85 = 515$.\n        The condition $U \\ge 0$ is met.\n    -   Since the overall criterion requires both to be true, and the first is false, the rule correctly advises against implementation. This is the most complete and ethically sound criterion.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Implement if $Se \\cdot p \\ge (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)$, because this implies $PPV \\ge 0.50$, and capacity can be ignored when PPV is favorable.**\n-   Analysis: The condition $Se \\cdot p \\ge (1-Sp)\\cdot(1-p)$ is equivalent to $N_{TP} \\ge N_{FP}$, which in turn implies $PPV \\ge 0.50$. For the given values, $0.80 \\cdot 0.15 = 0.12$ and $(1-0.90) \\cdot (1-0.15) = 0.10 \\cdot 0.85 = 0.085$. Since $0.12 \\ge 0.085$, the condition holds. However, like option A, this criterion makes the critical error of ignoring capacity, which violates the clinic's explicit ethical policy.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Implement if $K \\ge N \\cdot Se \\cdot p$, because ensuring capacity for all expected true positives is sufficient; harms from false positives are negligible compared with benefits to true positives.**\n-   Analysis: The condition is $K \\ge N_{TP}$. For the given values, $120 \\ge 120$, which is true. This rule would suggest implementation. However, this rule is flawed for two reasons. First, it completely ignores the safety constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$, which depends on the total number of positives ($N_{T^+} = 205$), not just true positives. Second, it wrongly dismisses the harm from false positives as \"negligible\" when the problem assigns a specific harm value to them. It is an incomplete application of the ethical principles.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Implement if $b_t \\cdot PPV \\cdot K \\ge h_f \\cdot (1-PPV)\\cdot K$, because net benefit among those who can be served will be positive regardless of the total number of positives.**\n-   Analysis: This criterion is flawed because it only considers the utility for the $K$ individuals who are linked, and it incorrectly models the harms. It ignores the harm $h_u$ to true positives who are identified but not linked. It also ignores the harm to false positives who are not linked (the problem states harm is for every FP, not just linked ones). Most importantly, it completely ignores the explicit safety-capacity policy constraint $\\phi \\ge \\lambda$. The logic is incomplete and does not account for all harms or constraints.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
