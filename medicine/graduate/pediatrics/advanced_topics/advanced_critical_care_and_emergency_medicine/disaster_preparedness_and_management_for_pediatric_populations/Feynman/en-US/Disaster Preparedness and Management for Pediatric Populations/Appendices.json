Use only the measured variables provided for each child: respiratory rate (breaths per minute), capillary refill time (seconds), and responsiveness on AVPU. Assume a patent airway has been opened for all children before measurements, and that if a child’s respiratory rate is recorded as zero, respirations do not resume with airway repositioning or brief ventilatory assistance for this simulation.\n\nUse the following evidence-based decision rules, derived from pediatric triage practice patterns and physiologic thresholds, to assign exactly one category to each child:\n\n- Immediate (red): child is breathing and any of the following hold: respiratory rate $RR < 15$ breaths per minute or $RR > 45$ breaths per minute; capillary refill time $CRT > 2$ seconds; responsiveness is Pain ($P$) or Unresponsive ($U$) on the AVPU scale.\n\n- Minor (green): child is Alert ($A$) on AVPU and simultaneously satisfies $20 \\le RR \\le 35$ breaths per minute and $CRT \\le 2$ seconds.

The initial rehydration volume, $V_{rehyd}$, administered once on day $1$.\n2. The total maintenance fluid volume over $5$ days, $V_{maint, 5d}$.\n3. The total replacement volume for ongoing diarrheal losses over $5$ days, $V_{loss, 5d}$.\n\n$$V_{child} = V_{rehyd} + V_{maint, 5d} + V_{loss, 5d}$$\n\nLet $w$ be the child's weight in $\\mathrm{kg}$, and $S$ be the number of loose stools per day.\n\n**Task 1: Per-Child Rates and Volumes**\n\nFor each group, we compute the required rates and per-stool volume.\n- **Group A** ($w=8\\,\\mathrm{kg}$):\n  - Rehydration rate: $(75\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 4\\,\\mathrm{hr} = 150\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Maintenance rate: $(100\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg/day} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 24\\,\\mathrm{hr} = \\frac{800}{24} = \\frac{100}{3}\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr} \\approx 33.3\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Per-stool volume: $10\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- **Group B** ($w=20\\,\\mathrm{kg}$):\n  - Rehydration rate: $(75\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 4\\,\\mathrm{hr} = 375\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Maintenance rate: $(1000\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 50\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times (20-10)\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 24\\,\\mathrm{hr} = \\frac{1500}{24} = 62.5\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Per-stool volume: $10\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 20\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- **Group C** ($w=28\\,\\mathrm{kg}$):\n  - Rehydration rate: $(75\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 28\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 4\\,\\mathrm{hr} = 525\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Maintenance rate: $(1500\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 20\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times (28-20)\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 24\\,\\mathrm{hr} = \\frac{1660}{24} = \\frac{415}{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr} \\approx 69.2\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Per-stool volume: $10\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 28\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 280\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- **Group D** ($w=36\\,\\mathrm{kg}$):\n  - Rehydration rate: $(75\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 36\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 4\\,\\mathrm{hr} = 675\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Maintenance rate: $(1500\\,\\mathrm{mL} + 20\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times (36-20)\\,\\mathrm{kg}) / 24\\,\\mathrm{hr} = \\frac{1820}{24} = \\frac{455}{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr} \\approx 75.8\\,\\mathrm{mL/hr}$.\n  - Per-stool volume: $10\\,\\mathrm{mL/kg} \\times 36\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 360\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Task 2: Per-Group 5-Day Volumes**\n\n- **Group A** ($N=10, w=8\\,\\mathrm{kg}, S=6$):\n  - $V_{rehyd} = 75 \\times 8 = 600\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{maint, 5d} = 5 \\times (100 \\times 8) = 4000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{loss, 5d} = 5 \\times 6 \\times (10 \\times 8) = 2400\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{child, A} = 600 + 4000 + 2400 = 7000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{group, A} = 10 \\times 7000 = 70000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n- **Group B** ($N=15, w=20\\,\\mathrm{kg}, S=5$):\n  - $V_{rehyd} = 75 \\times 20 = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{maint, 5d} = 5 \\times (1000 + 50 \\times (20-10)) = 5 \\times 1500 = 7500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{loss, 5d} = 5 \\times 5 \\times (10 \\times 20) = 5000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{child, B} = 1500 + 7500 + 5000 = 14000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{group, B} = 15 \\times 14000 = 210000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n- **Group C** ($N=15, w=28\\,\\mathrm{kg}, S=4$):\n  - $V_{rehyd} = 75 \\times 28 = 2100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{maint, 5d} = 5 \\times (1500 + 20 \\times (28-20)) = 5 \\times 1660 = 8300\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{loss, 5d} = 5 \\times 4 \\times (10 \\times 28) = 5600\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{child, C} = 2100 + 8300 + 5600 = 16000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{group, C} = 15 \\times 16000 = 240000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n- **Group D** ($N=10, w=36\\,\\mathrm{kg}, S=4$):\n  - $V_{rehyd} = 75 \\times 36 = 2700\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{maint, 5d} = 5 \\times (1500 + 20 \\times (36-20)) = 5 \\times 1820 = 9100\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{loss, 5d} = 5 \\times 4 \\times (10 \\times 36) = 7200\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{child, D} = 2700 + 9100 + 7200 = 19000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n  - $V_{group, D} = 10 \\times 19000 = 190000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n\n**Task 3: Aggregate Buffered Volume**\nSum the total volumes for all groups to get the aggregate volume.\n$$V_{agg} = V_{group, A} + V_{group, B} + V_{group, C} + V_{group, D}$$\n$$V_{agg} = 70000 + 210000 + 240000 + 190000 = 710000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nApply the logistics buffer of $\\alpha = 0.1$.\n$$V_{buffered} = V_{agg} \\times (1 + \\alpha) = 710000 \\times (1 + 0.1) = 710000 \\times 1.1 = 781000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\n**Task 4: Total ORS Packets**\nConvert the buffered volume to the number of ORS packets, where each packet yields $1000\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n$$P = \\frac{V_{buffered}}{1000} = \\frac{781000}{1000} = 781$$\nThe total number of ORS packets required is $781$.",
