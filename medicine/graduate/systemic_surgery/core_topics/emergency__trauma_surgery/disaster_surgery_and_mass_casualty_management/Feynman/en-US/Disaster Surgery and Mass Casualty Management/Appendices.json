            "problem": "A magnitude $7.2$ earthquake results in a mass casualty incident with $250$ adult patients triaged on arrival to a forward surgical facility using three categories: Immediate (red), Delayed (yellow), and Minimal (green). Injury Severity Score (ISS) is obtained within $12$ hours for all patients. For the purposes of evaluating triage performance relative to surgical resource allocation, consider the following operational definitions grounded in trauma systems science: patients with $ISS \\geq 15$ are “severely injured” and, in the absence of overriding palliative criteria, typically require prioritization for immediate life-saving interventions; Immediate triage denotes assignment to high-acuity care with priority access to emergency operative capability; Delayed and Minimal triage denote assignment to lower-acuity pathways.\n\nA dataset of counts is summarized as follows:\n- Immediate: $90$ patients, of whom $52$ have $ISS \\geq 15$ and $38$ have $ISS < 15$.\n- Delayed: $110$ patients, of whom $22$ have $ISS \\geq 15$ and $88$ have $ISS < 15$.\n- Minimal: $50$ patients, of whom $3$ have $ISS \\geq 15$ and $47$ have $ISS < 15$.\n\nIn mass casualty management, two performance rates are used to assess triage decisions:\n- Overtriage rate: the proportion of patients assigned to Immediate triage who are not severely injured by ISS.\n- Undertriage rate: the proportion of patients assigned to Delayed or Minimal triage who are severely injured by ISS.\n\nAssume system targets of $0.35$ for overtriage and $0.05$ for undertriage, and define a weighted deviation score\n$$\nS \\equiv w_{o}\\left(\\text{Overtriage} - 0.35\\right)^{2} + w_{u}\\left(\\text{Undertriage} - 0.05\\right)^{2},\n$$\nwith $w_{o} = 1$ and $w_{u} = 4$ to reflect the higher clinical risk of undertriage.\n\nUsing only the dataset above and the operational definitions, compute the overtriage rate and the undertriage rate as decimals, then compute $S$. Round your final value of $S$ to four significant figures. Express all rates and the final value of $S$ as decimals (not fractions and not percentages). The final submitted answer must be the single rounded value of $S$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific grounding, consistency, and completeness. The problem is set in the context of mass casualty management, a sub-discipline of surgery. It utilizes standard, well-defined metrics such as Injury Severity Score (ISS), triage categories (Immediate, Delayed, Minimal), and performance indicators (overtriage, undertriage). The provided numerical data is internally consistent ($52+38=90$; $22+88=110$; $3+47=50$; $90+110+50=250$). The definitions for overtriage and undertriage are clear and unambiguous. The formula for the weighted deviation score $S$ is explicitly given. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is well-posed. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\nThe objective is to compute the overtriage rate, the undertriage rate, and the weighted deviation score $S$.\n\nFirst, we identify the relevant patient counts from the problem description.\nLet $N_I$ be the total number of patients triaged as Immediate. $N_I = 90$.\nLet $N_D$ be the total number of patients triaged as Delayed. $N_D = 110$.\nLet $N_M$ be the total number of patients triaged as Minimal. $N_M = 50$.\nLet $N_{I,NS}$ be the number of non-severely injured ($ISS < 15$) patients in the Immediate category. $N_{I,NS} = 38$.\nLet $N_{D,S}$ be the number of severely injured ($ISS \\geq 15$) patients in the Delayed category. $N_{D,S} = 22$.\nLet $N_{M,S}$ be the number of severely injured ($ISS \\geq 15$) patients in the Minimal category. $N_{M,S} = 3$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Overtriage rate, which we denote as $R_o$. The definition provided is \"the proportion of patients assigned to Immediate triage who are not severely injured by ISS\". This is the ratio of non-severely injured patients in the Immediate group to the total number of patients in the Immediate group.\n$$\nR_o = \\frac{N_{I,NS}}{N_I} = \\frac{38}{90}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\nR_o \\approx 0.42222...\n$$\nNext, we calculate the Undertriage rate, which we denote as $R_u$. The definition provided is \"the proportion of patients assigned to Delayed or Minimal triage who are severely injured by ISS\". This is the ratio of severely injured patients in the Delayed and Minimal groups combined to the total number of patients in these two groups.\nThe number of severely injured patients in the Delayed and Minimal categories is $N_{D,S} + N_{M,S}$.\nThe total number of patients in the Delayed and Minimal categories is $N_D + N_M$.\n$$\nR_u = \\frac{N_{D,S} + N_{M,S}}{N_D + N_M} = \\frac{22 + 3}{110 + 50} = \\frac{25}{160}\n$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$\nR_u = 0.15625\n$$\nNow we compute the weighted deviation score $S$ using the given formula:\n$$\nS \\equiv w_{o}\\left(R_o - T_o\\right)^{2} + w_{u}\\left(R_u - T_u\\right)^{2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the target rates $T_o = 0.35$ and $T_u = 0.05$, and the weights $w_o = 1$ and $w_u = 4$. We substitute these values along with the calculated rates $R_o$ and $R_u$ into the equation for $S$. To maintain precision, we use the fractional forms of the rates for as long as possible.\n$$\nS = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{38}{90} - 0.35\\right)^{2} + 4 \\cdot \\left(0.15625 - 0.05\\right)^{2}\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms in the parentheses:\n$$\nR_o - T_o = \\frac{38}{90} - \\frac{35}{100} = \\frac{19}{45} - \\frac{7}{20} = \\frac{19 \\cdot 4}{180} - \\frac{7 \\cdot 9}{180} = \\frac{76 - 63}{180} = \\frac{13}{180}\n$$\n$$\nR_u - T_u = 0.15625 - 0.05 = 0.10625 = \\frac{25}{160} - \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{5}{32} - \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 5}{160} - \\frac{1 \\cdot 8}{160} = \\frac{25-8}{160} = \\frac{17}{160}\n$$\nNow, substitute these exact fractional differences into the expression for $S$:\n$$\nS = 1 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{13}{180}\\right)^{2} + 4 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{17}{160}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\frac{13^2}{180^2} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{17^2}{160^2} = \\frac{169}{32400} + 4 \\cdot \\frac{289}{25600} = \\frac{169}{32400} + \\frac{289}{6400}\n$$\nTo obtain the final numerical value, we can use decimal expansions:\n$$\nS \\approx 0.00521604938... + 0.04515625\n$$\n$$\nS \\approx 0.05037229938...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final value of $S$ rounded to four significant figures. The first non-zero digit is $5$, which is the first significant figure. The subsequent significant figures are $0$, $3$, and $7$. The fifth significant figure is $2$. Since $2 < 5$, we round down, which means we keep the fourth significant figure as it is.\n$$\nS \\approx 0.05037\n$$",

Compute the closed-form value of $S$ for the given parameters. Express $S$ as a dimensionless number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in operations research and queueing theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated. There are no violations of fundamental principles, contradictions, or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe objective is to derive a capacity stress test metric, the surge exceedance factor $S$, and compute its value. The factor $S$ is defined as the ratio of demand to capacity over a finite time horizon $T$.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\n-   Demand (number of arriving cases): $N = 25$\n-   Time horizon: $T = 60$ minutes\n-   Number of servers (Operating Rooms): $c = 2$\n-   Average surgical time per case: $\\tau_{s} = 90$ minutes\n-   Average turnover time between cases: $\\tau_{t} = 30$ minutes\n\nThe surge exceedance factor $S$ is defined as:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\text{Demand}}{\\text{Capacity}}\n$$\n\nThe demand, measured in cases, is explicitly given as $N$.\n$$\n\\text{Demand} = N\n$$\n\nThe capacity must be derived from first principles as specified. Capacity is defined as the number of case-equivalents that can be processed during the horizon $T$. This is determined by the total available processing time and the time required to process a single case.\n\nFirst, we determine the mean cycle time per case, $\\tau_{cycle}$, for a single operating room. The problem states this is the sum of the average surgical time and the average turnover time.\n$$\n\\tau_{cycle} = \\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}\n$$\nThis represents the total time a single operating room is occupied to process one patient from the start of surgery until the room is ready for the next patient.\n\nNext, we determine the total available service time across all operating rooms over the horizon $T$. With $c$ operating rooms, each available for a duration $T$, the total available OR-minutes, which we denote as $\\mathcal{T}_{total}$, is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}_{total} = c \\times T\n$$\n\nThe system's total capacity, $C$, measured in the number of cases it can process, is the total available service time divided by the service time required per case.\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\mathcal{T}_{total}}{\\tau_{cycle}} = \\frac{c T}{\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}}\n$$\n\nNow we can formulate the surge exceedance factor $S$ by substituting the expressions for demand and capacity.\n$$\nS = \\frac{N}{C} = \\frac{N}{\\frac{c T}{\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t}}}\n$$\nThis can be written in its final closed form:\n$$\nS = \\frac{N (\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t})}{c T}\n$$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as required. The numerator, $N (\\tau_{s} + \\tau_{t})$, has units of cases $\\times$ (minutes/case), resulting in units of minutes. The denominator, $c T$, has units of (dimensionless servers) $\\times$ minutes, also resulting in minutes. The ratio is therefore dimensionless.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $S$ by substituting the given parameters:\n- $N = 25$\n- $\\tau_{s} = 90$ minutes\n- $\\tau_{t} = 30$ minutes\n- $c = 2$\n- $T = 60$ minutes\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean cycle time:\n$$\n\\tau_{cycle} = 90 \\text{ min} + 30 \\text{ min} = 120 \\text{ min}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the capacity $C$:\n$$\nC = \\frac{2 \\times 60 \\text{ min}}{120 \\text{ min}} = \\frac{120}{120} = 1 \\text{ case-equivalent}\n$$\nThe system has the capacity to fully process $1$ case within the $60$-minute horizon.\n\nThe surge exceedance factor $S$ is then the ratio of the demand $N=25$ cases to the capacity $C=1$ case.\n$$\nS = \\frac{25}{1} = 25\n$$\nAlternatively, using the derived formula for $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{25 \\times (90 + 30)}{2 \\times 60} = \\frac{25 \\times 120}{120} = 25\n$$\nThe surge exceedance factor is $25$, indicating that the demand is $25$ times greater than the system's processing capacity over the specified horizon.",

You will construct a decision-making model that balances patient priority, travel times, and the real-time availability of surgical and ICU resources across multiple facilities . Mastering this systems-level thinking is essential for optimizing patient flow and maximizing survival in a large-scale emergency.",
            "id": "5110858",
            "problem": "A Mass Casualty Incident (MCI) produces a time-stamped stream of surgical patients who require definitive operative care in an Operating Room (OR) and immediate post-operative care in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). You must construct a discrete-time allocation algorithm that assigns each incoming patient to a facility and a scheduled arrival time such that, upon arrival, both one OR slot and one ICU bed are available at that facility in that discrete-time step. The algorithm must respect causality, travel times, and finite capacities, and it must update the residual capacities dynamically as each assignment is made.\n\nFundamental basis and constraints to use:\n- Flow conservation under discrete capacity: a facility cannot allocate more than the number of OR slots or ICU beds it has in a given time step. Formally, if a facility $j$ has OR capacity $OR_{j,t}$ and ICU capacity $ICU_{j,t}$ in step $t$, then the number of patients assigned to arrive at step $t$ for facility $j$ cannot exceed $\\min(OR_{j,t}, ICU_{j,t})$.\n- Causality and travel time constraint: a patient $i$ with scene release time $t_i$ can only arrive at a facility $j$ at or after time $t_i + TT_j$, where $TT_j$ is the travel time to facility $j$.\n- Discretization: use a fixed step size $\\Delta$ (in minutes). Continuous time $\\tau$ maps to discrete step index $a = \\left\\lfloor \\tau / \\Delta \\right\\rfloor$. Step indices are $0, 1, \\dots, T-1$ and represent intervals $[0,\\Delta), [\\Delta, 2\\Delta), \\dots, [(T-1)\\Delta, T\\Delta)$.\n- Maximum tolerable wait: each patient $i$ may be scheduled to arrive no later than $t_i + TT_j + W$, where $W$ is a nonnegative wait bound. In discrete steps, candidate arrival steps for facility $j$ lie in the closed integer interval $a \\in \\left[\\left\\lfloor (t_i+TT_j)/\\Delta \\right\\rfloor, \\min\\left(T-1, \\left\\lfloor (t_i+TT_j+W)/\\Delta \\right\\rfloor\\right)\\right]$.\n- Priority discipline: process patients in ascending order of $t_i$ (earlier release first). For equal $t_i$, process in ascending acuity $A_i$ where $A_i = 1$ is highest priority. If there is still a tie, break by increasing original input index.\n- Myopic objective at decision time: for a given patient $i$, among all facilities $j$ and feasible arrival steps $a$ that satisfy the above constraints and have strictly positive residual capacities in both OR and ICU at step $a$, select the pair $(j,a)$ that minimizes $a$ (earliest definitive care). If there is a tie in $a$ across facilities, break ties by smaller $TT_j$, and then by smaller facility index $j$. Upon assignment, decrement $OR_{j,a}$ and $ICU_{j,a}$ by $1$. If no feasible $(j,a)$ exists for any facility, assign the patient to overflow $0$ and make no capacity changes.\n\nAll time quantities must be handled in minutes. Facility indices are positive integers starting at $1$. Overflow is encoded as integer $0$.\n\nYour program must implement the above algorithm precisely and apply it to the test suite below. For each test case, return a list of assigned facility indices for the patients, ordered exactly as the patients are listed in that test case. Aggregate all test case results into one list of lists.\n\nTest suite (all times in minutes, step size $\\Delta$ in minutes, answer as integers without units):\n- Test case $1$:\n  - $\\Delta = 15$, $F = 2$, $T = 6$, $W = 60$.\n  - Travel times $TT = [10, 25]$.\n  - OR capacities by facility and step:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]$.\n  - ICU capacities by facility and step:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0]$.\n  - Patients as $(t_i, A_i)$ in listed order:\n    - $[(0, 1), (15, 2), (15, 1), (30, 3)]$.\n- Test case $2$:\n  - $\\Delta = 15$, $F = 2$, $T = 4$, $W = 30$.\n  - Travel times $TT = [15, 15]$.\n  - OR capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 0, 1, 0]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[1, 0, 1, 0]$.\n  - ICU capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 0, 1, 0]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[1, 0, 1, 0]$.\n  - Patients: $[(0, 1)]$.\n- Test case $3$ (overflow edge case):\n  - $\\Delta = 15$, $F = 1$, $T = 3$, $W = 15$.\n  - Travel times $TT = [10]$.\n  - OR capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[0, 0, 0]$.\n  - ICU capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 1, 1]$.\n  - Patients: $[(0, 1)]$.\n- Test case $4$ (dynamic update and tie-breaking):\n  - $\\Delta = 15$, $F = 3$, $T = 5$, $W = 45$.\n  - Travel times $TT = [10, 10, 25]$.\n  - OR capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[1, 0, 1, 0, 0]$.\n    - Facility $3$: $[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]$.\n  - ICU capacities:\n    - Facility $1$: $[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$.\n    - Facility $2$: $[1, 1, 0, 0, 0]$.\n    - Facility $3$: $[0, 1, 1, 1, 0]$.\n  - Patients: $[(0, 1), (0, 2), (15, 1)]$.\n\nFinal output format requirement:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of lists with no spaces, for example, $[[\\dots],[\\dots],\\dots]$.

            "solution": "The problem presented is a discrete-time resource allocation and scheduling challenge, situated within the context of mass casualty incident management. The task is to design an algorithm that assigns surgical patients to medical facilities, respecting a detailed set of constraints including facility capacities, patient travel times, and maximum wait times.\n\nThe problem statement is validated as sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of operations research and discrete-event simulation, which are standard STEM approaches for modeling and optimizing complex systems. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete, consistent, and objective set of rules, including explicit priority and tie-breaking mechanisms. This determinism ensures that a unique solution exists and can be found by a direct implementation of the specified algorithm.\n\nThe solution is a step-by-step, myopic scheduling algorithm that processes patients sequentially and makes the best possible assignment for each one at the time of decision, without considering future patient arrivals. The residual capacities of the resources (Operating Rooms and ICU beds) are updated dynamically after each assignment, affecting the decisions for subsequent patients.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **System Initialization**: For each test case, the parameters—time step size $\\Delta$, number of facilities $F$, number of time steps $T$, and maximum wait time $W$—are defined. The initial capacities for Operating Rooms ($OR_{j,a}$) and Intensive Care Units ($ICU_{j,a}$) for each facility $j$ and time step $a$ are initialized from the input data.\n\n2.  **Patient Prioritization**: Patients must be processed in a specific, non-preemptive priority order. The list of incoming patients, each characterized by a scene release time $t_i$ and an acuity level $A_i$, is sorted. The primary sorting key is the release time $t_i$ in ascending order. Ties in $t_i$ are broken by the acuity level $A_i$ in ascending order (where a smaller value of $A_i$ indicates higher priority). Any remaining ties are broken by the patient's original index in the input list, also in ascending order. This ensures a unique and deterministic processing sequence.\n\n3.  **Iterative Assignment**: The algorithm iterates through the prioritized list of patients. For each patient $i$, it seeks the optimal assignment pair $(j, a)$ representing an assignment to facility $j$ at a scheduled arrival in time step $a$.\n\n4.  **Candidate Search**: For the current patient $i$, the algorithm evaluates each facility $j \\in \\{1, 2, ..., F\\}$ as a potential destination.\n    \n    a.  **Feasible Arrival Window**: For each facility $j$, a window of feasible discrete arrival time steps is calculated. This window is constrained by causality, travel time, and the maximum tolerable wait. The earliest possible arrival time in continuous minutes is $\\tau_{min} = t_i + TT_j$, where $TT_j$ is the travel time to facility $j$. The latest permissible arrival time is $\\tau_{max} = t_i + TT_j + W$. These are mapped to discrete time steps using the formula $a = \\lfloor \\tau / \\Delta \\rfloor$. The range of candidate arrival steps is the closed integer interval:\n    $$ a \\in \\left[ a_{start}, a_{end} \\right] = \\left[ \\lfloor (t_i + TT_j) / \\Delta \\rfloor, \\min(T-1, \\lfloor (t_i + TT_j + W) / \\Delta \\rfloor) \\right] $$\n    The search must not exceed the maximum simulation time step, hence the $\\min(T-1, \\dots)$ term.\n\n    b.  **Capacity Check and Candidate Generation**: The algorithm iterates through the time steps $a$ from $a_{start}$ to $a_{end}$. For each step, it checks if there is sufficient capacity at facility $j$. An assignment is feasible only if the residual capacities for both the OR and the ICU are strictly positive:\n    $$ \\text{OR}_{j,a} > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\text{ICU}_{j,a} > 0 $$\n    The first step $a$ within the window that satisfies this condition represents the earliest possible service time at facility $j$ for patient $i$. This pair $(j, a)$ becomes a candidate for assignment. Since the primary objective is to minimize arrival time $a$, we need only consider this first feasible step for each facility.\n\n5.  **Optimal Decision**: After evaluating all facilities, the algorithm holds a list of candidate assignments, where each candidate is a tuple $(a, TT_j, j)$ corresponding to the best option offered by each facility. The algorithm selects the globally optimal assignment based on the specified myopic objective:\n    -   Primary criterion: Minimize the arrival time step $a$.\n    -   Secondary criterion (tie-breaker): Minimize the travel time $TT_j$.\n    -   Tertiary criterion (tie-breaker): Minimize the facility index $j$.\n    This is achieved by sorting the list of candidate tuples and selecting the first one.\n\n6.  **State Update and Overflow**:\n    -   If an optimal assignment $(j^*, a^*)$ is found, the patient is assigned to facility $j^*$. The system state is then updated by decrementing the capacities for that facility and time step:\n        $$ \\text{OR}_{j^*, a^*} \\leftarrow \\text{OR}_{j^*, a^*} - 1 $$\n        $$ \\text{ICU}_{j^*, a^*} \\leftarrow \\text{ICU}_{j^*, a^*} - 1 $$\n    -   If no feasible assignment can be found for the patient across any facility within their respective time windows, the patient is assigned to an overflow category, denoted by the integer $0$. In this case, no capacity updates are made.\n\n7.  **Result Aggregation**: The assigned facility index (or $0$ for overflow) for each patient is recorded. After all patients in a test case have been processed, the resulting list of assignments is ordered according to the patients' original input sequence before being added to the final collection of results.\n\nThis structured, deterministic procedure is implemented to process the provided test suite and generate the required output.",
