It is a standard application of calculus to a biophysical system.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires deriving an expression for the intraabdominal pressure, $P(t)$, as a function of time, $t$. The solution is built upon the fundamental definitions of compliance and volumetric flow rate.\n\nAbdominal compliance, $C$, is defined as the change in volume, $dV$, per unit change in pressure, $dP$. Since compliance is given as a constant, we can write this relationship as:\n$$\nC = \\frac{dV}{dP}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to express the rate of change of pressure with respect to volume:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dV} = \\frac{1}{C}\n$$\nThe volumetric flow rate of the insufflating gas, $Q$, is defined as the rate of change of volume with respect to time, $t$. Based on the problem's assumptions (conservation of mass, no leakage), this rate is constant:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nWe wish to find the function $P(t)$, which describes the pressure's dependence on time. We can relate the rate of change of pressure with respect to time, $\\frac{dP}{dt}$, to the rates we know by using the chain rule from calculus:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\frac{dP}{dV} \\cdot \\frac{dV}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\frac{dP}{dV}$ and $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{1}{C}\\right) \\cdot (Q) = \\frac{Q}{C}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $P(t)$. To solve for $P(t)$, we can integrate both sides with respect to time. We perform a definite integration from the initial state (time $t'=0$, pressure $P(0)$) to a general state (time $t$, pressure $P(t)$):\n$$\n\\int_{P(0)}^{P(t)} dP' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{Q}{C} dt'\n$$\nSince $Q$ and $C$ are constants, the term $\\frac{Q}{C}$ can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\nP(t) - P(0) = \\frac{Q}{C} \\int_{0}^{t} dt'\n$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\nP(t) - P(0) = \\frac{Q}{C} [t']_{0}^{t} = \\frac{Q}{C} (t-0) = \\frac{Q}{C} t\n$$\nThe problem states that the initial pressure at $t=0$ is $P(0) = 0\\ \\text{mmHg}$. Substituting this initial condition into the equation yields the expression for the intraabdominal pressure as a function of time:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{Q}{C} t\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must calculate the intraabdominal pressure at time $t = 2\\ \\text{min}$. We are given the following values:\n- Volumetric flow rate, $Q = 2\\ \\text{L/min}$\n- Abdominal compliance, $C = 0.2\\ \\text{L/mmHg}$\n- Time, $t = 2\\ \\text{min}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $P(t)$:\n$$\nP(2\\ \\text{min}) = \\frac{2\\ \\text{L/min}}{0.2\\ \\text{L/mmHg}} \\cdot (2\\ \\text{min})\n$$\nThe units are consistent and result in pressure units:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{min}} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{mmHg}}{\\text{L}} \\cdot \\text{min} = \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$\nP(2\\ \\text{min}) = \\frac{2}{0.2} \\cdot 2\\ \\text{mmHg} = 10 \\cdot 2\\ \\text{mmHg} = 20\\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to two significant figures. The exact answer is $20$. To represent this value with two significant figures, it is best expressed in scientific notation. Therefore, the pressure is $2.0 \\times 10^{1}\\ \\text{mmHg}$.",
