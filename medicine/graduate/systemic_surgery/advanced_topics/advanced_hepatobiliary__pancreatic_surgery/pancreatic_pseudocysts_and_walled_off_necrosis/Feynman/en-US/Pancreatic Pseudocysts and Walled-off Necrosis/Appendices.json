            "problem": "A patient aged $52$ years was hospitalized for severe necrotizing pancreatitis $5$ weeks ago and now presents with persistent early satiety, low-grade fevers, and abdominal pain. Laboratory evaluation shows a white blood cell count of $14\\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$ and C-reactive protein of $115\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (computed tomography, CT) today demonstrates a well-circumscribed peripancreatic collection measuring $12\\times 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ with homogeneous low attenuation of approximately $10$–$20$ Hounsfield units, abutting the posterior gastric wall without interposed bowel, and no obvious enhancing septations. Magnetic resonance imaging (magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) obtained the same day reveals a predominantly T2-hyperintense collection with internal low-signal strands, areas of diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging, and non-enhancement on subtraction sequences consistent with approximately $40\\%$ non-liquid debris. There is no evidence of portal hypertension or perigastric varices on recent cross-sectional imaging. The patient is hemodynamically stable, with no organ failure, and has been nil per os with enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube for $10$ days. \n\nUsing the following fundamental bases:\n- The revised Atlanta classification defines a pancreatic pseudocyst as an encapsulated, homogeneous fluid collection with negligible solid debris arising after interstitial edematous pancreatitis; walled-off necrosis (walled-off necrosis, WON) is an encapsulated collection of necrotic tissue and fluid that matures typically after $\\geq 4$ weeks following necrotizing pancreatitis.\n- Computed tomography quantifies attenuation in Hounsfield units and is less sensitive than magnetic resonance imaging for detecting internal solid necrotic debris; magnetic resonance imaging, particularly T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and contrast-enhanced sequences, better identifies non-liquid components.\n- Endoscopic ultrasound (endoscopic ultrasound, EUS) allows real-time assessment of internal echogenic debris and Doppler mapping to avoid intervening vessels.\n- Step-up management principles favor the least invasive effective intervention first, escalating only if there is inadequate clinical response, to minimize procedure-related morbidity.\n\nGiven the conflicting depiction of debris burden on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, which of the following is the most appropriate way to reconcile the data and choose an initial low-regret intervention?\n\nA. Accept the computed tomography characterization as definitive, diagnose a pancreatic pseudocyst, and place two small-caliber double-pigtail plastic cystogastrostomy stents endoscopically without endoscopic ultrasound guidance or further assessment.\n\nB. Consider the magnetic resonance imaging depiction of non-liquid debris more reliable for internal content, confirm with endoscopic ultrasound at the time of intervention to evaluate for solid components and vascularity, and perform an endoscopic ultrasound-guided cystogastrostomy with a $15$–$20\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ lumen-apposing metal stent (lumen-apposing metal stent, LAMS), with or without nasocystic irrigation, reserving direct endoscopic necrosectomy for nonresponse per a step-up approach.\n\nC. Because any percutaneous drain is less invasive than endoscopy, place a $10$–$12\\ \\mathrm{Fr}$ percutaneous catheter into the collection as the universal first step regardless of antral adherence, and avoid transgastric routes to prevent contamination.\n\nD. Proceed directly to early open necrosectomy through a midline laparotomy because magnetic resonance imaging shows solid debris and immediate debridement reduces infection risk.\n\nE. Defer all intervention for an additional $4$–$6$ weeks to allow further wall maturation because of conflicting imaging findings, and reassess only if organ failure develops.",
            "solution": "### Phase 1: Problem Validation\n\n1.  **Givens Extraction**:\n    *   Patient: $52$ years old, $5$ weeks post-necrotizing pancreatitis.\n    *   Presentation: Symptomatic (early satiety, fever, pain) with elevated inflammatory markers (WBC $14\\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$, CRP $115\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$).\n    *   CT Findings: $12\\times 10\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ collection, homogeneous low attenuation ($10$–$20$ HU), suggesting a simple fluid collection (pseudocyst).\n    *   MRI Findings: Same collection has internal low-signal strands and diffusion restriction, consistent with $\\approx 40\\%$ non-liquid debris, suggesting walled-off necrosis (WON).\n    *   Location: Abuts posterior gastric wall.\n    *   Patient Status: Hemodynamically stable, no organ failure.\n    *   Principles: Definitions of pseudocyst/WON, relative sensitivities of CT and MRI, role of EUS, and the step-up approach.\n\n2.  **Validation**: The problem is valid. It presents a common and realistic clinical dilemma where different imaging modalities provide conflicting information. The givens and first principles are scientifically sound and sufficient to derive a logical clinical management plan.\n\n### Phase 2: Solution Derivation\n\n1.  **Reconcile Imaging Data**: The foundational principles state that MRI is more sensitive than CT for detecting solid necrotic debris. The MRI shows low-signal strands and diffusion restriction, which are classic signs of solid necrotic material within a collection. Therefore, the MRI findings are more reliable. The collection should be treated as a WON, not a simple pseudocyst.\n\n2.  **Determine Need for Intervention**: The patient is symptomatic (pain, satiety) and shows signs of infection (fever, elevated inflammatory markers). This constitutes a clear indication for intervention to achieve source control and relieve symptoms. Waiting is not appropriate (eliminates E).\n\n3.  **Choose Intervention Modality and Strategy**:\n    *   The diagnosis is WON, which contains significant solid debris. According to the principles of endoscopic management, simple plastic stents are inadequate for draining solid debris and would likely clog. This eliminates option A.\n    *   The \"step-up\" approach is the standard of care for a stable patient. Proceeding directly to open necrosectomy is overly aggressive and associated with higher morbidity. This eliminates option D.\n    *   The collection is located adjacent to the posterior gastric wall, which is an ideal location for an endoscopic transluminal approach. A transgastric route is generally preferred over a percutaneous route for centrally located collections to avoid the risk of a chronic pancreatico-cutaneous fistula. This makes option C (percutaneous drainage first) a less optimal choice.\n    *   Option B proposes the most logical sequence: trust the superior imaging (MRI), confirm with the gold standard for real-time assessment (EUS) at the time of the procedure, and use the appropriate hardware for WON (a LAMS). A LAMS creates a large-caliber fistula, facilitating the drainage of both liquid and solid components. It also correctly incorporates the \"step-up\" principle by reserving direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) for patients who do not improve with drainage alone. This plan is safe, effective, and adheres to all the provided foundational bases.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A**: Incorrect. Relies on the less sensitive CT scan and proposes an inadequate intervention (plastic stents) for what is likely a WON. EUS guidance is also standard of care for safety, and this option omits it.\n*   **B**: Correct. This option correctly prioritizes the more sensitive imaging (MRI), uses EUS for definitive real-time confirmation and safety, selects the appropriate device (LAMS) for the suspected diagnosis (WON), and adheres to the step-up philosophy.\n*   **C**: Incorrect. While percutaneous drainage is part of the step-up approach, it is generally not the preferred first-line modality for a collection that is easily and safely accessible via an endoscopic transluminal route.\n*   **D**: Incorrect. Violates the step-up principle by escalating directly to the most invasive option in a stable patient.\n*   **E**: Incorrect. The patient is symptomatic and infected, which are clear indications for intervention. Delaying treatment is unsafe.",

            "introduction": "Once a decision for endoscopic drainage is made, selecting the appropriate hardware is paramount for procedural success, especially when necrosectomy is anticipated. This problem challenges you to justify the choice of a larger-caliber lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) by integrating practical mechanical constraints with the physical laws governing fluid dynamics.

            "problem": "A $54$-year-old patient presents $4$ weeks after severe necrotizing pancreatitis with fever, abdominal pain, and early organ dysfunction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography shows a mature encapsulated collection in the lesser sac measuring a maximal dimension of $15$ $\\mathrm{cm}$, with heterogeneous attenuation and an estimated solid necrotic fraction exceeding $50\\%$, consistent with walled-off necrosis (WON). Endoscopic ultrasound-guided transluminal drainage with a Lumen-Apposing Metal Stent (LAMS) is planned, and direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN) is anticipated due to the thick, adherent debris. The team must choose between a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ and a $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS.\n\nStarting from first principles relevant to general surgery of pancreatic collections, use the following fundamental bases to reason which choice is most appropriate:\n\n- By definition, a pancreatic pseudocyst is an encapsulated fluid collection with negligible solid debris, whereas WON is an encapsulated collection containing variable amounts of solid necrosis. Collections with substantial solid content frequently require mechanical debridement via DEN rather than passive drainage alone.\n- Safe passage of a therapeutic gastroscope for DEN requires that the stent inner diameter exceeds the outer diameter of the scope with a practical margin to accommodate tissue apposition, stent flare, and dynamic deformation. A typical therapeutic gastroscope has an outer diameter of approximately $9.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- For the liquid fraction of the collection, the instantaneous volume flow through a cylindrical conduit under laminar conditions is governed by the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship, $$Q \\propto r^4,$$ and cross-sectional area is $$A = \\pi r^2,$$ where $r$ is the radius of the conduit. Even acknowledging that necrotic contents are non-Newtonian and include solids, larger luminal diameter reduces the probability of clogging and increases the margin for instrument passage and repeated debridement.\n\nWhich option provides the most scientifically sound justification for selecting the $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS rather than the $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS in this patient?\n\nA. Choose the $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS because its inner diameter comfortably exceeds the approximately $9.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ outer diameter of a therapeutic gastroscope, enabling repeated DEN without stent-induced compression; the cross-sectional area and laminar flow capacity scale as $A \\propto r^2$ and $Q \\propto r^4$, making a $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ lumen provide roughly $\\left(\\frac{15}{10}\\right)^2$ times the area and $\\left(\\frac{15}{10}\\right)^4$ times the flow capacity for the liquid fraction compared with a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ stent, thereby mitigating occlusion by viscous debris.\n\nB. Choose the $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS to minimize bleeding and buried stent risk; smaller diameter stents cause less tissue trauma and are equally effective for thick debris because suction alone evacuates solids.\n\nC. Prefer two double-pigtail plastic stents over LAMS because plastic stents resist occlusion better in necrotic collections and their narrow lumens allow DEN accessories to pass while avoiding endoscope passage through the stent.\n\nD. Avoid LAMS entirely and use percutaneous catheter drainage because large WON with thick debris is best managed with percutaneous drains alone, which are superior to endoscopic approaches for evacuating solids.\n\nE. Use the $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS only when the collection exceeds $20$ $\\mathrm{cm}$; at $15$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ maximal dimension, a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS provides adequate clearance for DEN in most cases.",
            "solution": "### Phase 1: Problem Validation\n\n1.  **Givens Extraction**:\n    *   Patient: $54$-year-old with WON, $4$ weeks after severe necrotizing pancreatitis.\n    *   Collection: $15$ $\\mathrm{cm}$ WON with $>50\\%$ solid necrotic fraction.\n    *   Planned Intervention: EUS-guided drainage with a LAMS, with anticipated direct endoscopic necrosectomy (DEN).\n    *   Decision Point: Choose between a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ and a $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS.\n    *   Principles: (1) WON with solid debris needs DEN. (2) Mechanical constraint: DEN requires passing a therapeutic gastroscope (outer diameter $\\approx 9.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$) through the stent.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded clinical decision-making problem that requires the direct application of the provided mechanical and physical principles.\n\n### Phase 2: Solution Derivation\n\n1.  **Analyze the Primary Mechanical Constraint (Principle 2)**: The problem states that DEN is anticipated. DEN requires passing a therapeutic gastroscope through the LAMS into the necrotic cavity.\n    *   The endoscope has an outer diameter of $\\approx 9.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    *   A $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS has an inner diameter of $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. Attempting to pass a $9.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ scope through this stent is mechanically unsafe and impractical. There is virtually no clearance, which would lead to extreme difficulty, risk of scope damage, and potential stent dislodgement. Principle 2 explicitly states a \"practical margin\" is needed.\n    *   A $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS provides a sufficient margin ($15\\,\\mathrm{mm} > 9.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), allowing for safe and repeated passage of the endoscope to perform the necessary mechanical debridement.\n    *   This single mechanical constraint makes the $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS the only viable option if DEN is to be performed.\n\n2.  **Analyze the Fluid/Debris Dynamics (Principle 3)**: The collection has a high burden of solid, viscous debris.\n    *   **Area**: The cross-sectional area available for drainage is proportional to the radius squared ($A \\propto r^2$). The ratio of areas for the two stents is $(\\frac{15}{10})^2 = 2.25$. The $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ stent provides over twice the area, significantly reducing the risk of being clogged by solid debris.\n    *   **Flow Rate**: The flow rate for the liquid component is proportional to the radius to the fourth power ($Q \\propto r^4$). The ratio of flow rates is $(\\frac{15}{10})^4 \\approx 5.06$. The $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ stent provides over five times the potential drainage capacity for liquid, further ensuring the tract remains patent.\n    *   These physical principles strongly support the choice of the larger stent to manage a collection with a high solid fraction.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A**: Correct. This option correctly identifies the critical mechanical requirement for DEN (scope passage) and accurately applies the physical principles of area and flow rate to justify why a $15$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS is superior for managing a WON with a high solid fraction. It integrates all the provided principles into a cohesive and accurate justification.\n*   **B**: Incorrect. This option falsely claims a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS is \"equally effective\" when it mechanically prohibits the planned DEN procedure.\n*   **C**: Incorrect. This option proposes using plastic stents, which are known to be inferior to LAMS for draining WON, as they are highly prone to occlusion by solid debris. It also misrepresents how DEN is performed.\n*   **D**: Incorrect. This option evades the question by arguing for a different modality (percutaneous drainage) instead of addressing the choice between LAMS sizes.\n*   **E**: Incorrect. This option introduces an arbitrary size criterion ($20$ $\\mathrm{cm}$) not based on the provided principles and falsely claims a $10$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ LAMS provides adequate clearance for DEN, which is mechanically untrue.",

            "problem": "A patient with severe acute pancreatitis developed a walled-off necrosis (WON), defined as an encapsulated collection containing necrotic tissue that typically matures after approximately $4$ weeks. Twelve days after endoscopic ultrasound (Endoscopic Ultrasound, EUS)-guided cystogastrostomy with placement of a lumen-apposing metal stent (Lumen-Apposing Metal Stent, LAMS) for WON that presented at $5$ weeks from onset, a $54$-year-old man presents with fever of $38.6\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, heart rate of $112$ beats per minute, blood pressure of $118/72\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, and white blood cell (White Blood Cell, WBC) count of $17\\times 10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$. He has worsening epigastric pain and decreased output from the cystogastrostomy tract, without frank gastrointestinal (Gastrointestinal, GI) bleeding, and no generalized peritoneal signs on examination. There is concern for stent migration either into the necrotic cavity (loss of apposition) or into the GI lumen with loss of drainage.\n\nUse the following foundational bases to reason to a management plan:\n- Source control in sepsis: removal of infected material and restoration of drainage reduce the inflammatory burden and risk of bacteremia.\n- Transmural drainage relies on a patent tract between the GI lumen and the WON; loss of apposition or migration interrupts this conduit, risking reaccumulation, infection, and perforation.\n- Imaging is required to localize foreign bodies and assess for complications such as free perforation, hemorrhage, and undrained collections.\n- Endoscopic approaches can retrieve migrated stents and re-establish access under EUS and fluoroscopy; percutaneous or surgical options are contingency pathways when endoscopic access fails or complications arise.\n\nWhich option best outlines a stepwise, comprehensive management plan that addresses suspected LAMS migration into either the cavity or GI lumen, integrating appropriate imaging to define anatomy and complications, endoscopic retrieval or reintervention as first-line in a hemodynamically stable patient, and contingency steps for failure or deterioration?\n\nA. Begin broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics for intra-abdominal sepsis; obtain urgent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (Contrast-Enhanced Computed Tomography, CECT) to localize the stent and evaluate for free air, hemorrhage, or new undrained collections; proceed to urgent endoscopy with EUS and fluoroscopy to inspect the cystogastrostomy site and GI lumen, retrieve the migrated stent (with snare or forceps) whether intracavitary or intraluminal, and re-establish drainage by guidewire access through the tract with placement of a new LAMS or double pigtail plastic stents; if endoscopic access cannot be re-established or the collection is compartmentalized, request interventional radiology (Interventional Radiology, IR) for percutaneous drainage; consult surgery emergently if CECT shows free perforation, uncontrolled hemorrhage, or if the patient becomes unstable; arrange short-interval imaging (within $48$–$72$ hours) to confirm source control.\n\nB.

The management must follow a logical, stepwise progression based on the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Immediate Actions (Principle 1)**: The patient meets sepsis criteria. Management must begin immediately with resuscitation (as needed), and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics to cover intra-abdominal pathogens. This stabilizes the patient while preparing for definitive source control.\n\n2.  **Diagnostic Workup (Principle 3)**: The exact location of the stent and the presence of life-threatening complications (e.g., free perforation) are unknown. An urgent contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is mandatory. It will provide a \"roadmap\" by localizing the stent, assessing the residual collection, and identifying any perforation or hemorrhage that would alter the management plan (e.g., necessitating immediate surgery).\n\n3.  **Definitive Intervention (Principle 4)**: Since the patient is hemodynamically stable, a minimally invasive approach is preferred. Endoscopy is the first-line modality.

Observing a septic patient without attempting source control violates fundamental medical principles.\n*   **C**: Incorrect. This approach is overly aggressive, skipping crucial diagnostic imaging and ignoring the established first-line role of minimally invasive endoscopy in a stable patient.\n*   **D**: Incorrect.
