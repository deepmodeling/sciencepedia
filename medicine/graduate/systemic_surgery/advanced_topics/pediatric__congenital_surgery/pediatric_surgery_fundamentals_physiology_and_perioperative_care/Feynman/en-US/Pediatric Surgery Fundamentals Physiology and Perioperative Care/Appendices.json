            "problem": "A child aged $6$ years presents for emergency abdominal surgery. As part of perioperative planning, you must select an appropriately sized endotracheal tube for airway management based on age-dependent airway scaling. The pediatric subglottic airway (at the cricoid ring) is the functionally narrowest segment, and for the age range $4$ to $12$ years, the recommended endotracheal tube internal diameter for an uncuffed tube is known to vary approximately linearly with age, based on widely accepted clinical observations. Specifically, two empirically validated points for uncuffed tube internal diameter (measured in millimeters) are: at age $4$ years, $5.0$ millimeters; at age $12$ years, $7.0$ millimeters. Treating the uncuffed internal diameter as a linear function of age, derive the linear relationship $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a)$, where $a$ is age in years. Then, incorporate the empirically observed adjustment that for a cuffed endotracheal tube, the internal diameter should be decreased by approximately $0.5$ millimeters compared to the uncuffed recommendation at the same age, yielding $ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a)$. Finally, apply your derived relationships to determine the recommended uncuffed and cuffed endotracheal tube internal diameters for a child aged $6$ years. Express the internal diameters in millimeters. No rounding is required. Provide both values in your final answer without units, as two entries in a single row.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established pediatric perioperative principles, specifically the standard empirical formulas used for endotracheal tube sizing. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information (two data points for a linear model) to derive a unique solution, and it is expressed in objective, formalizable language.\n\nThe task is to determine the appropriate internal diameters for uncuffed and cuffed endotracheal tubes for a child of age $6$ years. The problem states that the uncuffed tube internal diameter, denoted as $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}$, varies linearly with age, $a$. We can express this relationship as a linear function:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = m \\cdot a + b$$\nwhere $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. The variables are age $a$ in years and internal diameter $ID$ in millimeters.\n\nWe are given two data points from empirical observations:\n1. At age $a_1 = 4$ years, the internal diameter is $ID_1 = 5.0$ mm. This gives the point $(4, 5.0)$.\n2. At age $a_2 = 12$ years, the internal diameter is $ID_2 = 7.0$ mm. This gives the point $(12, 7.0)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope, $m$, of the linear function:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta ID}{\\Delta a} = \\frac{ID_2 - ID_1}{a_2 - a_1} = \\frac{7.0 - 5.0}{12 - 4} = \\frac{2}{8} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\nSo, the slope is $m = 0.25$.\n\nNext, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, $ID - ID_1 = m(a - a_1)$, to find the full equation. Substituting the first point $(4, 5.0)$ and the slope $m = \\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) - 5.0 = \\frac{1}{4}(a - 4)$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a - \\frac{1}{4}(4) + 5.0$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a - 1 + 5.0$$\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) = \\frac{1}{4}a + 4$$\nThis is the derived linear relationship for the uncuffed endotracheal tube internal diameter. This formula is consistent with the widely used Cole's formula for pediatric patients older than $2$ years.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to find the recommended uncuffed tube size for a child aged $a = 6$ years:\n$$ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(6) = \\frac{1}{4}(6) + 4 = \\frac{6}{4} + 4 = 1.5 + 4 = 5.5$$\nThe recommended internal diameter for an uncuffed tube is $5.5$ mm.\n\nNext, we address the cuffed endotracheal tube. The problem states that for a cuffed tube, the internal diameter should be decreased by $0.5$ millimeters compared to the uncuffed recommendation. Thus, the function for the cuffed tube internal diameter, $ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a)$, is:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a) = ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a) - 0.5$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(a)$:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(a) = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}a + 4\\right) - 0.5 = \\frac{1}{4}a + 3.5$$\nThis is consistent with the standard formula for cuffed tubes.\n\nWe now calculate the recommended cuffed tube size for a child aged $a = 6$ years:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(6) = \\frac{1}{4}(6) + 3.5 = 1.5 + 3.5 = 5.0$$\nAlternatively, we can directly use the result for the uncuffed tube at age $6$:\n$$ID_{\\text{cuffed}}(6) = ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}(6) - 0.5 = 5.5 - 0.5 = 5.0$$\nThe recommended internal diameter for a cuffed tube is $5.0$ mm.\n\nThe final answer requires both the uncuffed and cuffed internal diameters for a $6$-year-old child. These values are $5.5$ mm and $5.0$ mm, respectively.",

He has observed Nil Per Os (NPO) for $10$ $\\mathrm{hr}$ and has received no preoperative intravenous fluid. Assume the following widely accepted physiological bases and perioperative practices apply:\n1. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) in kilocalories per day for boys aged $3$ to $10$ years is given by the Schofield equation $BMR = 22.7 \\times W + 495$, where $W$ is weight in kilograms.\n2. In the perioperative setting for a healthy child, the total energy expenditure (TEE) can be approximated as $TEE = 1.5 \\times BMR$ to account for thermoregulatory and minimal activity costs while fasting.\n3. The Holliday–Segar energy-to-water equivalence holds, such that $1$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ of water is required per $1$ $\\mathrm{kcal}$ of energy expended to meet maintenance needs.\n4.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All provided data and physiological models, though simplified, are standard and consistent within the context of perioperative pediatric fluid management. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe total volume of crystalloid to be infused, $V_{total}$, over the first $2$ hours of anesthesia is the sum of three components:\n$1$. The maintenance fluid requirement for $2$ hours, $V_{maint}$.\n$2$. The portion of the preoperative fasting deficit replaced over the first $2$ hours, $V_{deficit}$.\n$3$. The volume to replace intraoperative third-space losses over $2$ hours, $V_{3rd-space}$.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n$$V_{total} = V_{maint} + V_{deficit} + V_{3rd-space}$$\n\nWe will calculate each component systematically.\n\nFirst, we determine the hourly maintenance fluid rate. This begins with calculating the basal metabolic rate (BMR) for the patient, a boy with weight $W = 18$ $\\mathrm{kg}$. Using the provided Schofield equation:\n$$BMR = 22.7 \\times W + 495$$\n$$BMR = 22.7 \\times 18 + 495 = 408.6 + 495 = 903.6 \\ \\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total energy expenditure (TEE) in the perioperative setting, which is given as $1.5$ times the BMR:\n$$TEE = 1.5 \\times BMR = 1.5 \\times 903.6 = 1355.4 \\ \\mathrm{kcal}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\nAccording to the Holliday-Segar energy-to-water equivalence, $1$ $\\mathrm{mL}$ of water is required for each $1$ $\\mathrm{kcal}$ of energy expended. Therefore, the daily maintenance fluid volume is numerically equal to the TEE:\n$$V_{maint, day} = 1355.4 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{day}$$\n\nTo find the hourly maintenance fluid rate, $\\dot{V}_{maint}$, we divide the daily volume by $24$ hours:\n$$\\dot{V}_{maint} = \\frac{1355.4 \\ \\mathrm{mL}}{24 \\ \\mathrm{hr}} = 56.475 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{hr}$$\n\nThe total maintenance fluid volume, $V_{maint}$, required over the first $2$ hours of surgery is:\n$$V_{maint} = \\dot{V}_{maint} \\times 2 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 56.475 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{hr} \\times 2 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 112.95 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nSecond, we calculate the replacement of the fasting deficit. The patient was NPO for $10$ hours. The total fluid deficit, $V_{deficit, total}$, is the product of the hourly maintenance rate and the fasting duration:\n$$V_{deficit, total} = \\dot{V}_{maint} \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 56.475 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{hr} \\times 10 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 564.75 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe protocol for replacing this deficit is to administer $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the total deficit in the first hour and $\\frac{1}{4}$ in the second hour. The total volume replaced over the first $2$ hours, $V_{deficit}$, is therefore:\n$$V_{deficit} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\times V_{deficit, total}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4} \\times V_{deficit, total}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\times V_{deficit, total}$$\n$$V_{deficit} = \\frac{3}{4} \\times 564.75 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 423.5625 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThird, we calculate the replacement for intraoperative third-space losses. The rate is given as $6$ $\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$. For an $18$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ patient, the hourly rate of loss, $\\dot{V}_{3rd-space}$, is:\n$$\\dot{V}_{3rd-space} = 6 \\ \\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{hr}^{-1} \\times 18 \\ \\mathrm{kg} = 108 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{hr}$$\n\nOver the first $2$ hours of surgery, the total volume to replace these losses, $V_{3rd-space}$, is:\n$$V_{3rd-space} = \\dot{V}_{3rd-space} \\times 2 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 108 \\ \\mathrm{mL}/\\mathrm{hr} \\times 2 \\ \\mathrm{hr} = 216 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nFinally, we sum the three components to find the total volume of fluid to be infused over the first $2$ hours:\n$$V_{total} = V_{maint} + V_{deficit} + V_{3rd-space}$$\n$$V_{total} = 112.95 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 423.5625 \\ \\mathrm{mL} + 216 \\ \\mathrm{mL} = 752.5125 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$V_{total} \\approx 752.5 \\ \\mathrm{mL}$$",

The anesthesiology plan requires estimating an appropriate ETT depth at the incisors to minimize the risk of endobronchial intubation while preventing accidental extubation.\n\nUse the following well-tested pediatric airway scaling facts as the foundational base:\n1. The internal diameter of an uncuffed pediatric ETT in millimeters scales with age according to $ID_{\\text{uncuffed}}\\,(\\text{mm}) \\approx 4 + \\frac{\\text{age}}{4}$.

Oral ETT depth at the incisors correlates approximately linearly with tube size due to coupled scaling of tracheal length and airway diameter. Empirically, the proportionality constant linking depth in centimeters to internal diameter in millimeters is approximately $3$, such that depth estimated from tube size follows a linear relation with slope $3$.\n3. The mouth-to-carina distance in centimeters scales approximately linearly with age due to airway growth, with an intercept and slope modeled by $12\\,\\text{cm}$ and $0.5\\,\\text{cm/year}$ respectively.\n\nFurther, assume the following uncertainty structure in these two empiric depth estimates, reflecting measurement and model variability observed in pediatric cohorts:\n- The diameter-based depth estimate has a standard deviation $\\sigma_{1} = 0.4\\,\\text{cm}$.\n- The age-based depth estimate has a standard deviation $\\sigma_{2} = 0.8\\,\\text{cm}$.\n\nStarting from these facts, derive two independent estimates of the ETT depth at the incisors for this patient: one based on tube diameter scaling and one based on age-based airway length.
