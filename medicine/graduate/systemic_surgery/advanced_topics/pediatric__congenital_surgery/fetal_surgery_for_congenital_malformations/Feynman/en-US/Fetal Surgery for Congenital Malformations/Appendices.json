The complementary events are $D^c$ (no disease) and $T^-$ (test negative). The provided information is:\n- Pretest prevalence of spina bifida: $P(D) = 0.002$.\n- Sensitivity of the ultrasound marker: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.85$.\n- Specificity of the ultrasound marker: $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$.\n- The definitions of sensitivity and specificity are given as $P(\\text{test positive} \\mid \\text{disease})$ and $P(\\text{test negative} \\mid \\text{no disease})$, respectively.\n- The task is to derive the post-test probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$ from first principles using Bayes’ theorem and the law of total probability.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of probability theory, specifically conditional probability and Bayes' theorem, which are standard tools in medical diagnostics and epidemiology. The values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are realistic for a prenatal screening test.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data to calculate the desired quantity. It asks for a specific value, the post-test probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$, and there exists a unique, stable solution derivable from the given information.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws: it is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, well-posed, non-trivial, and verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to compute the post-test probability of the disease given a positive test result, which is denoted as the conditional probability $P(D \\mid T^+)$. The problem specifies that this must be derived from first principles using Bayes' theorem.\n\nBayes' theorem states that for two events $A$ and $B$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(B \\mid A) P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this to our specific events $D$ and $T^+$, we have:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe terms in the numerator are provided in the problem statement:\n- $P(T^+ \\mid D)$ is the sensitivity, given as $0.85$.\n- $P(D)$ is the pretest prevalence, given as $0.002$.\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the overall probability of a positive test in the population. This term is not directly given and must be calculated using the law of total probability. The law of total probability states that the probability of an event can be found by summing its conditional probabilities over a set of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events. In this case, the sample space is partitioned by the presence of the disease, $D$, and the absence of the disease, $D^c$.\nThus, the probability $P(T^+)$ is given by:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)$$\nWe need to determine each term in this expression:\n1.  $P(T^+ \\mid D)$: This is the sensitivity, given as $0.85$.\n2.  $P(D)$: This is the prevalence, given as $0.002$.\n3.  $P(T^+ \\mid D^c)$: This is the probability of a positive test given no disease (a false positive). It is not directly given, but can be derived from the specificity. Specificity is $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.95$. Since for any given condition (here, $D^c$), the test must be either positive or negative, the sum of their probabilities must be $1$. Therefore:\n    $$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1$$\n    $$P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n4.  $P(D^c)$: This is the probability of not having the disease. It is the complement of the prevalence $P(D)$.\n    $$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.002 = 0.998$$\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the law of total probability to calculate $P(T^+)$:\n$$P(T^+) = (0.85)(0.002) + (0.05)(0.998)$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0017 + 0.0499$$\n$$P(T^+) = 0.0516$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the values for $P(T^+ \\mid D)$, $P(D)$, and $P(T^+)$ into Bayes' theorem to find the desired post-test probability, $P(D \\mid T^+)$:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{(0.85)(0.002)}{0.0516}$$\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{0.0017}{0.0516}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.0329457364...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures. The first significant figure is $3$, followed by $2$, $9$, and $4$. The fifth significant figure is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth significant figure.\n$$P(D \\mid T^+) \\approx 0.03295$$\nThis is the post-test probability, or positive predictive value, of the ultrasound marker for spina bifida in this population.",

It is not ill-posed; it leads to a single, stable answer.\n6.  It is not pseudo-profound or trivial; it requires the correct application of several principles in sequence.\n7.  The calculation is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate, $Q_{single}$, through a single cylindrical vessel under the specified conditions is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$Q_{single} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r^4}{8 \\mu L}$$\nwhere $r$ is the vessel radius, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure gradient, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is the length of the vessel.\n\nLet the initial (baseline) state be denoted by the subscript $1$ and the final (pathologic) state be denoted by the subscript $2$.\n\nThe initial flow through a single artery is:\n$$Q_{single,1} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P_1 r_1^4}{8 \\mu_1 L_1}$$\nThe final flow through a single artery is:\n$$Q_{single,2} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P_2 r_2^4}{8 \\mu_2 L_2}$$\nAccording to the problem statement, the pressure gradient, viscosity, and length remain unchanged. Thus, $\\Delta P_1 = \\Delta P_2 = \\Delta P$, $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu$, and $L_1 = L_2 = L$.\n\nThe radius is reduced such that $r_2 = 0.80 \\times r_1$.\n\nThe ratio of the final flow to the initial flow for a single artery is:\n$$\\frac{Q_{single,2}}{Q_{single,1}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_2^4}{8 \\mu L}}{\\frac{\\pi \\Delta P r_1^4}{8 \\mu L}} = \\frac{r_2^4}{r_1^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_2}{r_1}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the given relationship for the radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_{single,2}}{Q_{single,1}} = \\left(\\frac{0.80 \\times r_1}{r_1}\\right)^4 = (0.80)^4$$\nThe total maternal intervillous inflow, $Q_{total}$, is the sum of flows through the $N$ arteries, which are arranged in parallel. Since the arteries are identical and the pressure drop across each is the same, the total flow is $N$ times the flow through a single artery.\n$$Q_{total} = N \\times Q_{single}$$\nThe problem states that the number of arteries, $N$, is also unchanged ($N_1 = N_2 = N$). Therefore, the ratio of the total final flow to the total initial flow is:\n$$\\frac{Q_{total,2}}{Q_{total,1}} = \\frac{N Q_{single,2}}{N Q_{single,1}} = \\frac{Q_{single,2}}{Q_{single,1}} = (0.80)^4$$\nThe problem specifies that the steady-state fetal oxygen delivery rate, $O_{2,D}$, scales in direct proportion to the maternal intervillous inflow, $Q_{total}$. This can be written as:\n$$O_{2,D} = k \\times Q_{total}$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This relationship holds because the transplacental oxygen transfer is perfusion-limited and the arteriovenous oxygen content difference per unit flow is assumed to be constant.\n\nThe factor by which the fetal oxygen delivery changes is the ratio of the final delivery rate, $O_{2,D,2}$, to the initial delivery rate, $O_{2,D,1}$:\n$$\\frac{O_{2,D,2}}{O_{2,D,1}} = \\frac{k \\times Q_{total,2}}{k \\times Q_{total,1}} = \\frac{Q_{total,2}}{Q_{total,1}}$$\nThus, the change factor for oxygen delivery is the same as the change factor for a total flow.\n$$\\text{Factor} = (0.80)^4$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$(0.80)^2 = 0.6400$$\n$$(0.80)^4 = ((0.80)^2)^2 = (0.6400)^2 = 0.4096$$\nThe result, $0.4096$, has exactly four significant figures as required.

Solve for the Threshold Weight $w^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe threshold $w^{\\ast}$ is the value of $w$ at which the utilities are equal: $U_F = U_E$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Q_F] - w^{\\ast} \\mathbb{E}[M_F] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_E] - w^{\\ast} \\mathbb{E}[M_E]\n$$\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $w^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nw^{\\ast} \\mathbb{E}[M_E] - w^{\\ast} \\mathbb{E}[M_F] = \\mathbb{E}[Q_E] - \\mathbb{E}[Q_F]\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\ast} (\\mathbb{E}[M_E] - \\mathbb{E}[M_F]) = \\mathbb{E}[Q_E] - \\mathbb{E}[Q_F]\n$$\nTo maintain positive numerators and denominators, as is conventional, we multiply by $-1$:\n$$\nw^{\\ast} (\\mathbb{E}[M_F] - \\mathbb{E}[M_E]) = \\mathbb{E}[Q_F] - \\mathbb{E}[Q_E]\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[Q_F] - \\mathbb{E}[Q_E]}{\\mathbb{E}[M_F] - \\mathbb{E}[M_E]}\n$$\nThis ratio represents the marginal rate of substitution, or the \"price\" of an additional expected maternal QALY loss in terms of expected neonatal QALY gain.\n\nNow, we substitute the calculated expected values:\n$$\nw^{\\ast} = \\frac{20.661 - 17.48}{0.152 - 0.022}\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\ast} = \\frac{3.181}{0.130}\n$$\n$$\nw^{\\ast} \\approx 24.4692307...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nw^{\\ast} \\approx 24.47\n$$\nThis threshold $w^{\\ast}$ signifies the weight at which a decision-maker would be indifferent between the two strategies. If a decision-maker's personal or societal weighting of maternal harm relative to neonatal benefit is greater than $w^{\\ast}$, they would favor the less risky maternal option (expectant management). If their weight is less than $w^{\\ast}$, they would favor the option with higher neonatal benefit (prenatal repair).",
