This practice challenges you to apply the Fick principle to a realistic clinical vignette, quantitatively exploring the relationship between oxygen delivery ($DO_2$), oxygen consumption ($VO_2$), and cardiac output ().

            "problem": "A $58$-year-old patient with septic shock requiring vasopressors and mechanical ventilation is evaluated for tissue oxygenation in the operating room prior to debridement of necrotic soft tissue. Arterial blood gas shows hemoglobin $Hb = 9$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, arterial oxygen saturation $S_aO_2 = 0.92$, arterial oxygen partial pressure $P_aO_2 = 70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. Pulmonary function is stable, and the measured cardiac output $CO = 3.5$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$. A pulmonary artery catheter reports mixed venous oxygen saturation $S_vO_2 = 0.80$ and mixed venous oxygen partial pressure $P_vO_2 = 40$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$. Serum lactate is $4.8$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$. The patient is sedated and normothermic after resuscitation; norepinephrine is titrated to a mean arterial pressure of $70$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nUsing conservation of mass for transported oxygen and the concept that blood oxygen content is the sum of hemoglobin-bound oxygen plus physically dissolved oxygen, reason from first principles about oxygen transport and uptake. Oxygen delivery (first occurrence definition: $DO_2$) is the rate at which oxygen is transported to the tissues; oxygen consumption (first occurrence definition: $VO_2$) is the rate at which oxygen is taken up by the tissues. Arterial oxygen content (first occurrence definition: $C_aO_2$) and mixed venous oxygen content (first occurrence definition: $C_vO_2$) depend on hemoglobin-bound oxygen and dissolved oxygen; the specific oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin is approximately $1.34$ $\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/g\\,Hb}$, and the solubility of oxygen in plasma is approximately $0.003$ $\\mathrm{mL\\,O_2/dL/mmHg}$. Mixed venous and arterial oxygen contents can be estimated using the measured saturations and partial pressures. In septic shock, microcirculatory dysfunction and mitochondrial dysregulation can alter oxygen extraction, so that mixed venous oxygen saturation may be elevated despite tissue dysoxia.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct in this patient?\n\nA. $DO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by $C_aO_2$; increasing inspired oxygen fraction to raise $P_aO_2$ will produce only a modest increase in $DO_2$ compared with increasing $CO$ or increasing $Hb$, because hemoglobin-bound oxygen dominates $C_aO_2$.\n\nB. $VO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen content difference; using the provided data, $VO_2$ is approximately $50$–$60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, consistent with impaired extraction in sepsis and sedation-lowered metabolic demand.\n\nC. In septic shock, elevated $S_vO_2$ can coexist with increased lactate because microvascular shunting and mitochondrial dysfunction reduce oxygen extraction; thus $VO_2$ may remain low even when $DO_2$ is increased.\n\nD. Raising $P_aO_2$ from $70$ to $200$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ will increase $DO_2$ by more than $50\\%$ in this patient.\n\nE. If $CO$ increases from $3.5$ to $5.0$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$ while $Hb$, $S_aO_2$, and $P_aO_2$ are unchanged, $VO_2$ must increase in direct proportion to $CO$.\n\nF.

It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective question rooted in fundamental principles of physiology and critical care medicine. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nFrom first principles, the oxygen content of blood (in $\\mathrm{mL}$ of $O_2$ per $\\mathrm{dL}$ of blood) is the sum of oxygen bound to hemoglobin and oxygen dissolved in plasma. The general formula is:\n$$ C_xO_2 = (Hb \\times 1.34 \\times S_xO_2) + (P_xO_2 \\times 0.003) $$\nwhere $x$ can be arterial ($a$) or mixed venous ($v$), $Hb$ is in $\\mathrm{g/dL}$, $S_xO_2$ is the fractional saturation, and $P_xO_2$ is the partial pressure in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n\nOxygen delivery ($DO_2$) is the total rate of oxygen delivered to the tissues, given by the product of cardiac output ($CO$) and arterial oxygen content ($C_aO_2$). For unit consistency ($CO$ in $\\mathrm{L/min}$ and $C_aO_2$ in $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$), a conversion factor of $10$ is needed since $1$ $\\mathrm{L} = 10$ $\\mathrm{dL}$.\n$$ DO_2 = CO \\times C_aO_2 \\times 10 $$\nOxygen consumption ($VO_2$) is the rate of oxygen uptake by the tissues. By the principle of conservation of mass (the Fick principle), it is the difference between the rate of oxygen delivery and the rate of oxygen return to the lungs (in mixed venous blood).\n$$ VO_2 = CO \\times (C_aO_2 - C_vO_2) \\times 10 $$\n\n**Calculations based on patient data:**\n\n1.  **Arterial Oxygen Content ($C_aO_2$)**:\n    $$ C_aO_2 = (9\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} \\times 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g} \\times 0.92) + (70\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL/mmHg}) $$\n    $$ C_aO_2 = (11.0952) + (0.21) = 11.3052\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} $$\n\n2.  **Mixed Venous Oxygen Content ($C_vO_2$)**:\n    $$ C_vO_2 = (9\\,\\mathrm{g/dL} \\times 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g} \\times 0.80) + (40\\,\\mathrm{mmHg} \\times 0.003\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL/mmHg}) $$\n    $$ C_vO_2 = (9.648) + (0.12) = 9.768\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} $$\n\n3.  **Oxygen Delivery ($DO_2$)**:\n    $$ DO_2 = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 11.3052\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L} $$\n    $$ DO_2 = 395.682\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} $$\n\n4.  **Oxygen Consumption ($VO_2$)**:\n    $$ VO_2 = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times (11.3052 - 9.768)\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L} $$\n    $$ VO_2 = 3.5 \\times 1.5372 \\times 10 = 53.802\\,\\mathrm{mL/min} $$\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $DO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by $C_aO_2$; increasing inspired oxygen fraction to raise $P_aO_2$ will produce only a modest increase in $DO_2$ compared with increasing $CO$ or increasing $Hb$, because hemoglobin-bound oxygen dominates $C_aO_2$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement, \"$DO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by $C_aO_2$\", is the definition of oxygen delivery and is correct. For the second part, we analyze the composition of $C_aO_2$:\n- Hemoglobin-bound oxygen: $11.0952$ $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$\n- Dissolved oxygen: $0.21$ $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$\nThe hemoglobin-bound component constitutes $11.0952 / 11.3052 \\approx 98.1\\%$ of the total arterial oxygen content. $DO_2$ is directly proportional to $CO$ and nearly directly proportional to $Hb$. In contrast, increasing $P_aO_2$ primarily increases the very small dissolved oxygen component and has limited effect on the hemoglobin-bound component as saturation is already high at $S_aO_2 = 0.92$. Therefore, manipulating $CO$ or $Hb$ will have a substantially larger impact on $DO_2$ than manipulating $P_aO_2$. The reasoning is sound and the conclusion is correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. $VO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen content difference; using the provided data, $VO_2$ is approximately $50$–$60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, consistent with impaired extraction in sepsis and sedation-lowered metabolic demand.**\n\nThe first part, \"$VO_2$ equals $CO$ multiplied by the arteriovenous oxygen content difference\", is the correct Fick equation for oxygen consumption. Our calculation yielded $VO_2 = 53.802$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$, which is within the stated range of $50$–$60$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. This value is extremely low (a healthy resting adult is $\\approx 250$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$). This low $VO_2$ in the presence of severe shock (vasopressors required) and evidence of tissue hypoxia (lactate = $4.8$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) is pathognomonic for the impaired oxygen extraction characteristic of septic shock, compounded by the metabolic suppression from sedation. The elevated $S_vO_2$ of $0.80$ confirms low oxygen extraction. The statement is factually and numerically correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In septic shock, elevated $S_vO_2$ can coexist with increased lactate because microvascular shunting and mitochondrial dysfunction reduce oxygen extraction; thus $VO_2$ may remain low even when $DO_2$ is increased.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the central pathophysiology of distributive shock in sepsis. The patient's data ($S_vO_2=0.80$, lactate$=4.8$ $\\mathrm{mmol/L}$) perfectly exemplifies this paradox. The proposed mechanisms—microvascular shunting leading to blood bypassing metabolically active tissues, and mitochondrial dysfunction (cytopathic hypoxia) preventing cells from utilizing available oxygen—are the established explanations for why venous blood returns to the heart with high oxygen content despite systemic tissue hypoxia. This leads to a state where $VO_2$ becomes independent of or uncoupled from $DO_2$. Therefore, increasing $DO_2$ may fail to increase $VO_2$ because the fundamental problem lies in oxygen extraction and utilization, not just delivery. The entire statement is a correct description of this patient's condition.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. Raising $P_aO_2$ from $70$ to $200$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$ will increase $DO_2$ by more than $50\\%$ in this patient.**\n\nWe will calculate the new $DO_2$. At $P_aO_2 = 200$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, hemoglobin is essentially fully saturated, so we assume $S_aO_2 = 1.0$.\n- New $C_aO_2 = (9 \\times 1.34 \\times 1.0) + (200 \\times 0.003) = 12.06 + 0.60 = 12.66$ $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$.\n- New $DO_2 = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 12.66\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L} = 443.1$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n- Initial $DO_2$ was $395.682$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n- The percentage increase is: $( (443.1 - 395.682) / 395.682 ) \\times 100\\% = (47.418 / 395.682) \\times 100\\% \\approx 12.0\\%$.\nAn increase of $12.0\\%$ is not more than $50\\%$.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. If $CO$ increases from $3.5$ to $5.0$ $\\mathrm{L/min}$ while $Hb$, $S_aO_2$, and $P_aO_2$ are unchanged, $VO_2$ must increase in direct proportion to $CO$.**\n\nThe statement claims that $VO_2 \\propto CO$. From the Fick equation, $VO_2 = CO \\times (C_aO_2 - C_vO_2)$. For $VO_2$ to be directly proportional to $CO$, the term $(C_aO_2 - C_vO_2)$ must remain constant. Since $C_aO_2$ is constant by premise, this would require $C_vO_2$ to be constant. However, $C_vO_2$ is a dependent variable reflecting how much oxygen the tissues extract. In a state of supply-independent oxygen consumption, as seen in this septic patient, $VO_2$ is limited by metabolic demand and utilization defects. Increasing blood flow ($CO$) will likely result in the tissues extracting a smaller fraction of the delivered oxygen, causing $C_vO_2$ (and $S_vO_2$) to rise. This would keep $VO_2$ relatively constant, not cause it to rise proportionally with $CO$. The term \"must\" makes the statement definitively false, as it ignores the physiological regulation of oxygen extraction.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. Transfusing to increase $Hb$ from $9$ to $11$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$ at constant $CO$, $S_aO_2$, and $P_aO_2$ will increase $DO_2$ more than raising $P_aO_2$ from $70$ to $200$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$, because the hemoglobin-bound component dominates $C_aO_2$.**\n\nWe compare the absolute increase in $DO_2$ for two interventions.\n1.  **Raise $P_aO_2$ from $70$ to $200$ $\\mathrm{mmHg}$**: From the analysis in option D, the increase in $DO_2$ is $\\Delta DO_2 \\approx 47.4$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n2.  **Increase $Hb$ from $9$ to $11$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$**: We calculate the new $DO_2$ with $Hb = 11$ $\\mathrm{g/dL}$.\n    - New $C_aO_2 = (11 \\times 1.34 \\times 0.92) + (70 \\times 0.003) = 13.5608 + 0.21 = 13.7708$ $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$.\n    - New $DO_2 = 3.5\\,\\mathrm{L/min} \\times 13.7708\\,\\mathrm{mL/dL} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{dL/L} = 481.978$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n    - The increase is $\\Delta DO_2 = 481.978 - 395.682 = 86.296$ $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nComparing the two increases, $86.296\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$ (from transfusion) is greater than $47.4\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$ (from hyperoxia). The reasoning provided—that the hemoglobin-bound component dominates oxygen content—is the correct explanation for this result. The calculation confirms the statement.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**",

All concepts—septic shock, mechanical ventilation protocols, vasopressor use, PLR maneuver, and echocardiographic assessment of fluid responsiveness—are based on established physiological and medical principles. The fundamental principles listed are the cornerstones of cardiovascular physiology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a specific clinical scenario with quantitative data and asks for the selection of the correct physiological explanation and definition from a set of options, based on provided principles.

It is not unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived based on the provided principles and data.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires an explanation of the Passive Leg Raise (PLR) maneuver as a predictor of fluid responsiveness, using fundamental cardiovascular principles.\n\n1.  **Physiological Basis of PLR**: The PLR maneuver involves shifting a patient from a semi-recumbent position to one where the legs are elevated and the trunk is horizontal. This uses gravity to mobilize a volume of blood from the venous capacitance vessels of the lower limbs (and to some extent, the splanchnic circulation, depending on the initial trunk angle). This blood volume, estimated to be between $150\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ and $300\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, is transiently translocated to the central circulation (the thoracic compartment). This process represents a reversible, \"endogenous\" fluid challenge, consistent with the **conservation of mass in a closed circulatory system**.\n\n2.  **Effect on Venous Return**: The translocation of blood into the central compartment increases the stressed volume of the circulatory system, leading to an increase in the mean systemic filling pressure ($P_{msf}$). According to the Guyton model, venous return ($VR$) is driven by the pressure gradient between $P_{msf}$ and the right atrial pressure ($P_{RA}$), such that $VR = (P_{msf} - P_{RA}) / R_{VR}$, where $R_{VR}$ is the resistance to venous return. By increasing $P_{msf}$, the PLR maneuver increases the pressure gradient for venous return, thereby increasing $VR$.\n\n3.  **Effect on Cardiac Output and the Frank-Starling Mechanism**: At steady-state, **venous return equals cardiac output ($CO$)**. Therefore, the PLR-induced increase in $VR$ leads to an increase in right ventricular filling (preload). Subsequently, left ventricular preload increases. The **Frank-Starling relationship** dictates that an increase in ventricular preload (end-diastolic volume) will cause an increase in stroke volume ($SV$), provided the ventricle is on the ascending, steep portion of its function curve. Patients on this portion are termed \"preload responsive\". If the ventricle is on the flat portion of the curve, an increase in preload will result in little to no change in $SV$; such patients are \"preload unresponsive\". Thus, PLR serves as a test to determine the patient's position on the Frank-Starling curve.\n\n4.  **Defining and Measuring a Positive Response**: A positive response to PLR predicts that the patient's cardiac output will increase with an exogenous fluid bolus. The most accurate way to assess the response is by measuring a direct flow variable, such as $SV$ or $CO$, using methods like echocardiography, arterial pulse contour analysis, or esophageal Doppler. Changes in arterial blood pressure are less reliable because $MAP$ is a product of both $CO$ and systemic vascular resistance ($SVR$), and $SVR$ can change unpredictably, especially in septic shock. The effect of PLR is transient, with the peak response occurring within approximately $30$ to $90$ seconds. Therefore, the flow variable must be measured rapidly. A positive response is conventionally defined as an increase in $SV$ or $CO$ of at least $10\\%$ to $15\\%$.\n\n5.  **Analysis of Provided Data**:\n    - Baseline stroke volume, $SV_0 = 54\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n    - Post-PLR stroke volume, $SV_{PLR} = 61\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n    - The percentage change in stroke volume is calculated as:\n    $$ \\% \\Delta SV = \\frac{SV_{PLR} - SV_0}{SV_0} \\times 100\\% $$\n    $$ \\% \\Delta SV = \\frac{61\\,\\mathrm{mL} - 54\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{54\\,\\mathrm{mL}} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{7}{54} \\times 100\\% \\approx 12.96\\% $$\n    Since $12.96\\% > 10\\%$, the response is positive, indicating fluid responsiveness. The small change in MAP (from $65\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to $68\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$) underscores the insensitivity of pressure-based endpoints compared to flow-based ones.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. PLR transiently transfers blood from the highly compliant venous reservoirs of the lower limbs and splanchnic bed to the thoracic compartment, increasing mean systemic filling pressure, steepening the pressure gradient for venous return, and thereby increasing cardiac output if the ventricle operates on the ascending limb of the Frank–Starling curve; a positive PLR requires a promptly observed relative increase in directly measured cardiac output or stroke volume of at least $10\\%$, typically within $1$–$3\\,\\mathrm{min}$, and does not rely on changes in arterial pressure alone. Given $SV_0 = 54\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ and $SV_{PLR} = 61\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, the response is positive.**\n- **Physiological Rationale**: This statement accurately describes the mechanism of PLR, linking the translocation of venous volume to an increase in $P_{msf}$, the gradient for venous return, and the subsequent effect on cardiac output via the Frank-Starling mechanism. This is fully consistent with the required principles.\n- **Definition of Positive Response**: It correctly defines a positive response as a significant ($>10\\%$) increase in a flow variable ($CO$ or $SV$), measured promptly, and correctly notes the unreliability of arterial pressure alone.\n- **Data Interpretation**: It correctly calculates that the change from $54\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ to $61\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ represents a positive response (our calculation of $\\approx 13\\%$ confirms this).\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**B. PLR causes venous pooling in the elevated legs, reducing central venous return; a positive PLR is defined by an increase in mean arterial pressure of at least $10\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ sustained for $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$, regardless of changes in stroke volume.**\n- **Physiological Rationale**: The initial premise is fundamentally incorrect. Elevating the legs uses gravity to *drain* blood from them, increasing central venous return, not cause pooling and reduce it.\n- **Definition of Positive Response**: The definition is incorrect. It relies on a large change in an unreliable parameter (MAP), and the effect of PLR is transient, not sustained for $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. PLR is invalid during mechanical ventilation and in the presence of vasopressors because positive end-expiratory pressure abolishes preload dependence; a positive response is any increase in heart rate of at least $10\\,\\mathrm{beats}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$.**\n- **Physiological Rationale**: This is false. PLR is a valuable tool precisely in mechanically ventilated patients, as other indices like pulse pressure variation can be unreliable (e.g., with low tidal volumes like the $6\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ used here). Vasopressors do not invalidate the test. PEEP increases intrathoracic pressure but does not \"abolish\" preload dependence.\n- **Definition of Positive Response**: This is incorrect. The primary endpoint is a flow variable ($SV$ or $CO$), not heart rate. An increase in heart rate can be a confounding finding.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. PLR is physiologically equivalent to a rapid exogenous infusion of $500\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ crystalloid that irreversibly increases intravascular volume; a positive response is an increase in central venous pressure of at least $2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$.**\n- **Physiological Rationale**: This statement is flawed. The volume mobilized by PLR is smaller (approx. $150-300\\,\\mathrm{mL}$), and its key advantage is that it is **reversible**, unlike an exogenous infusion.\n- **Definition of Positive Response**: Using central venous pressure (CVP) as the endpoint is an outdated and unreliable method for assessing fluid responsiveness. CVP reflects right heart filling pressure but not the heart's functional response.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. PLR primarily increases systemic vascular resistance through lower limb muscle stretch, raising blood pressure without changing venous return; a positive response is any increase in mean arterial pressure of at least $5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ persisting beyond $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$.**\n- **Physiological Rationale**: This misrepresents the primary mechanism. The core effect of PLR is an increase in venous return (preload augmentation). Any effect on SVR is secondary and minor. The claim that it works *without changing venous return* is a direct contradiction of its purpose.\n- **Definition of Positive Response**: This definition is incorrect as it relies on an unreliable parameter (MAP) and an incorrect duration (the effect is transient, not persistent for $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$).\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "A postoperative patient with septic shock is managed in the intensive care unit and initiated on Continuous Venovenous Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), a form of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT).

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and presented in objective, formal language. All provided data and parameters are within clinically plausible ranges for the scenario described. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the total mass of vancomycin administered in the first $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$ of therapy. This total mass, $M_{\\mathrm{total}, 6\\mathrm{h}}$, is the sum of the initial loading dose, $LD$, and the cumulative mass delivered by the constant infusion over the first $6\\,\\mathrm{h}$. The plan is to administer the loading dose at time $t=0$ to instantaneously achieve the target steady-state concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, and simultaneously start the constant infusion at a rate, $R$, that will maintain this concentration.\n\nThe total mass is given by:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}, 6\\mathrm{h}} = LD + (R \\times 6\\,\\mathrm{h})$$\n\nWe must calculate the values of $LD$ and $R$. This requires a step-by-step determination of several pharmacokinetic parameters.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the target steady-state concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$)**\nThe therapeutic target is an area-under-the-curve over $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ to minimum inhibitory concentration ratio ($\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}/\\mathrm{MIC}$) of $500$. The given $MIC$ is $1\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}}{\\mathrm{MIC}} = 500$$\nThe target $24$-hour area under the curve is:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{24} = 500 \\times \\mathrm{MIC} = 500 \\times 1\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 500\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\nAt steady state with a constant infusion, the $\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}$ is related to the steady-state concentration $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ by:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC}_{24} = C_{\\mathrm{ss}} \\times 24\\,\\mathrm{h}$$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{24}}{24\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{500\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\mathrm{L}}}{24\\,\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{500}{24}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the apparent volume of distribution ($V_d$)**\nThe apparent volume of distribution is given per kilogram of body mass. The patient's body mass is $80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, and the volume of distribution per kilogram is $0.9\\,\\mathrm{L/kg}$.\n$$V_d = 0.9\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{L}}{\\mathrm{kg}} \\times 80\\,\\mathrm{kg} = 72\\,\\mathrm{L}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the loading dose ($LD$)**\nThe loading dose required to immediately achieve the target $C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$ is given by the formula $LD = V_d \\times C_{\\mathrm{ss}}$.\n$$LD = 72\\,\\mathrm{L} \\times \\frac{500}{24}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}} = 3 \\times 500\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1500\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the total body clearance ($CL_{\\mathrm{tot}}$)**\nTotal body clearance is the sum of all clearance pathways. In this patient, residual native renal clearance is negligible. Thus, clearance is the sum of non-renal (non-CRRT) clearance and clearance by CVVHDF ($CL_{\\mathrm{CRRT}}$).\n$$CL_{\\mathrm{tot}} = CL_{\\mathrm{nonrenal}} + CL_{\\mathrm{CRRT}}$$\nWe are given $CL_{\\mathrm{nonrenal}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{L/h}$.

Rounding this value to four significant figures gives $1783\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",
