            "introduction": "The cornerstone of effective treatment for localized prostate cancer is accurate preoperative planning, which begins with risk stratification. This process involves synthesizing multiple clinical data points—such as Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, biopsy grade, and clinical stage—to estimate the disease's aggressiveness. This exercise  challenges you to apply widely accepted clinical guidelines to a patient's case, guiding the crucial decision of whether radical prostatectomy is the right course of action and if a pelvic lymph node dissection should be performed concurrently.",

            "problem": "A male patient presents with clinically localized prostate cancer. The following preoperative data are available: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is $9.2$ in nanograms per milliliter, biopsy Grade Group $2$ (Gleason score $3+4$), clinical stage $c\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{a}$ on digital rectal examination and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, and a systematic biopsy with $12$ cores total and $4$ cores positive. There is no radiographic evidence of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or nodal disease. Using widely accepted risk stratification definitions for localized prostate cancer (for example, the D'Amico classification and its subdivisions used by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)), and guideline-based indications for pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) grounded in the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommendation to perform PLND when the estimated probability of lymph node invasion is at least $0.05$ according to validated preoperative nomograms, determine whether radical prostatectomy (RP) alone is indicated and whether PLND should be added.\n\nStart from the foundational definitions:\n- Low risk is characterized by PSA $10$ in nanograms per milliliter, Grade Group $1$, and clinical stage $\\mathrm{T}1$ to $\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{a}$.\n- Intermediate risk is characterized by any one of PSA in the interval $[10,20)$ in nanograms per milliliter, Grade Group $2$ to $3$, or clinical stage $\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{b}$ to $\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{c}$.\n- High risk includes PSA $\\ge 20$ in nanograms per milliliter, Grade Group $4$ to $5$, or clinical stage $\\ge \\mathrm{T}3$.\n\nSubdivide intermediate risk:\n- Favorable intermediate risk is defined by exactly one intermediate-risk factor, Grade Group $1$ to $2$, and biopsy involvement of at most $50\\%$ of cores.\n- Unfavorable intermediate risk includes Grade Group $3$ (Gleason $4+3$), multiple intermediate-risk factors, or biopsy involvement exceeding $50\\%$ of cores.\n\nUse the following decision codification:\n- Let $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=1$ if RP alone is indicated as the definitive local therapy, $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=2$ if RP with PLND is indicated, and $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}=0$ if RP is not indicated as a primary management strategy.\n- Let $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}=1$ if PLND should be added, and $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}=0$ otherwise.\n\nCompute the risk category from the given data using the above definitions, assess whether RP alone is indicated, and whether PLND should be added in light of the EAU threshold of $0.05$ for predicted lymph node invasion risk in intermediate-risk disease. Express your final decision vector as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix}$. No units are required in the final answer. If any intermediate numerical quantity requires approximation, round to four significant figures; however, the final coded decision values must be exact integers.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a determination of the appropriate surgical management for a patient with clinically localized prostate cancer based on provided preoperative data and a specific set of risk stratification rules. The decision must be encoded into a vector $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe problem provides a comprehensive set of givens:\n- Patient data: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of $9.2$ nanograms per milliliter, biopsy Grade Group $2$ (Gleason score $3+4$), clinical stage $c\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{a}$, and $4$ out of $12$ biopsy cores positive for cancer.\n- Imaging findings: No radiographic signs of advanced disease (extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle invasion, or nodal disease).\n- Definitions for risk stratification: A three-tiered system (Low, Intermediate, High) and a two-tiered subdivision for intermediate risk (Favorable, Unfavorable).\n- Guideline for pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND): PLND is indicated if the probability of lymph node invasion (LNI) is $\\ge 0.05$.\n- Codification for the final decision: A set of integer codes for $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on established, real-world clinical guidelines from urologic oncology (NCCN, EAU). The required information to proceed with a logical deduction is provided, assuming the standard clinical correlation that the provided risk stratification categories serve as a proxy for lymph node invasion risk. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution by systematically applying the given rules.\n\nStep 1: Determine the patient's overall risk category.\nThe problem defines risk categories based on PSA, Grade Group (GG), and clinical stage (T stage). We compare the patient's data to the criteria for each risk group.\n\n- PSA criterion: The patient's PSA is $9.2$ ng/mL. This value satisfies the Low risk criterion (PSA $ 10$ ng/mL).\n- Grade Group criterion: The patient's Grade Group is $2$. This value satisfies the Intermediate risk criterion (GG $2$ to $3$).\n- Clinical Stage criterion: The patient's stage is $c\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{a}$. This value satisfies the Low risk criterion (Stage $\\mathrm{T}1$ to $\\mathrm{T}2\\mathrm{a}$).\n\nA patient is assigned to the highest risk category for which they meet at least one criterion. Since the patient has one intermediate-risk factor (Grade Group $2$) and no high-risk factors, the patient is classified as having **Intermediate Risk** prostate cancer.\n\nStep 2: Sub-stratify the Intermediate Risk category.\nThe problem provides definitions to distinguish between Favorable Intermediate Risk (FIR) and Unfavorable Intermediate Risk (UIR).\n\n- **Favorable Intermediate Risk (FIR)** criteria:\n    1.  Exactly one intermediate-risk factor: The patient has only one intermediate-risk factor (Grade Group $2$). This criterion is met.\n    2.  Grade Group $1$ to $2$: The patient's Grade Group is $2$. This criterion is met.\n    3.  Biopsy involvement of at most $50\\%$ of cores: The patient has $4$ positive cores out of a total of $12$. The percentage of positive cores is $\\frac{4}{12} = \\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.3333$, which is $33.33\\%$. This is less than or equal to the $50\\%$ threshold. This criterion is met.\n\nSince the patient's profile fulfills all three conditions for FIR, he is classified as having **Favorable Intermediate Risk** disease.\n\nStep 3: Determine the indication for Radical Prostatectomy (RP).\nRadical prostatectomy is a standard primary definitive therapy for clinically localized prostate cancer, especially for patients with intermediate-risk disease who have a sufficient life expectancy (typically $>10$ years). As the problem presents a localized disease scenario and asks for the appropriate surgical management, RP is considered an indicated treatment option. Thus, the decision variable $D_{\\mathrm{RP}}$ cannot be $0$. The value will be either $1$ (RP alone) or $2$ (RP with PLND), depending on the PLND decision.\n\nStep 4: Determine the indication for Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection (PLND).\nThe indication for PLND is based on the EAU guideline provided: perform PLND if the estimated probability of lymph node invasion, $P(\\mathrm{LNI})$, is at least $0.05$. While a specific nomogram formula is not provided, the detailed risk stratification serves as a surrogate for this risk assessment. It is a well-established principle in urologic oncology that patients with Favorable Intermediate Risk disease, as defined in this problem, have a very low probability of LNI, which consistently falls below the $5\\%$ threshold when calculated using standard validated nomograms (e.g., Briganti, MSKCC). The FIR classification implies that $P(\\mathrm{LNI})  0.05$.\nTherefore, based on the problem's criteria, PLND should not be performed. This leads to the decision $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}} = 0$.\n\nStep 5: Synthesize the final decision vector.\nWe concluded that RP is an indicated therapy and that PLND is not. This corresponds to the selection of \"RP alone\".\n- The code for RP alone is $D_{\\mathrm{RP}} = 1$.\n- The code for not adding PLND is $D_{\\mathrm{PLND}} = 0$.\n\nThe final decision vector is $\\begin{pmatrix}D_{\\mathrm{RP}}  D_{\\mathrm{PLND}}\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}1  0\\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "introduction": "Executing a successful radical prostatectomy requires mastery of several key technical steps, with the vesicourethral anastomosis being among the most critical for ensuring a patient's long-term urinary continence. A precise, tension-free, and watertight connection between the bladder neck and urethral stump is paramount. This practice  provides a hands-on opportunity to translate the physical actions of suturing into a quantitative plan, reinforcing the importance of geometric precision and methodical execution in surgical technique.",
            "id": "5177762",
            "problem": "In a vesicourethral anastomosis following radical prostatectomy, a continuous running double-armed monofilament suture is used to achieve mucosa-to-mucosa apposition between the bladder neck and urethral stump. Assume the following technique and definitions are used throughout the anastomosis:\n\n1. Start at the posterior midline ($6$ o’clock) with two needles on a single suture, each arm assigned to one hemi-circumference. The left arm advances counterclockwise and the right arm advances clockwise toward the anterior midline ($12$ o’clock), maintaining symmetry.\n2. At each stitch location along the circumference, the sequence is an outside-in bite through the urethral wall followed by an inside-out bite through the bladder neck wall, such that mucosa-to-mucosa apposition is achieved. Each stitch location therefore comprises exactly two needle passes (one pass through urethra, one pass through bladder).\n3. The spacing between successive stitch locations, measured along the circumference of the anastomosis, is uniform and equal to $s=3\\ \\text{mm}$.\n4. The anastomotic circumference is $C=24\\ \\text{mm}$. The anastomosis is completed when the two arms meet at $12$ o’clock without gaps; additional reinforcement stitches are not used, and the terminal tie does not add passes beyond those already counted at the final stitch locations.\n5. Use the smallest integer number of stitch locations required to fully traverse the circumference with uniform spacing, and take each location as described above.\n\nFrom first principles of geometry and the above surgical constraints, determine the total number of needle passes required to complete the anastomosis across both arms. Express your final answer as a dimensionless integer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total number of needle passes to complete a vesicourethral anastomosis based on a specific surgical technique and geometric parameters. The solution can be derived from first principles by systematically analyzing the provided constraints.\n\nFirst, we identify the key quantitative parameters provided in the problem statement. The total circumference of the anastomosis is given as $C=24\\ \\text{mm}$. The uniform spacing between successive stitch locations along this circumference is given as $s=3\\ \\text{mm}$.\n\nThe total number of stitch locations, which we denote as $N_{\\text{loc}}$, can be determined by dividing the total circumference by the spacing between each location. This is a direct consequence of arranging points equidistantly on a closed loop. The problem statement confirms this approach by specifying the \"smallest integer number of stitch locations required to fully traverse the circumference with uniform spacing,\" which mathematically corresponds to the ratio of the total length to the interval length.\n$$N_{\\text{loc}} = \\frac{C}{s}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$N_{\\text{loc}} = \\frac{24\\ \\text{mm}}{3\\ \\text{mm}} = 8$$\nThus, there are exactly $8$ stitch locations distributed uniformly around the circumference of the anastomosis. The descriptive details about the start at the $6$ o'clock position and the meeting of the two suture arms at the $12$ o'clock position serve to illustrate how this circular anastomosis is constructed but do not alter the total number of locations. These points ($6$ o'clock and $12$ o'clock) are themselves stitch locations, part of the total count of $8$. The remaining $6$ locations are distributed symmetrically, with $3$ on each hemi-circumference.\n\nNext, the problem defines the procedure at each of these locations. According to constraint $2$, \"At each stitch location along the circumference, the sequence is an outside-in bite through the urethral wall followed by an inside-out bite through the bladder neck wall, such that mucosa-to-mucosa apposition is achieved. Each stitch location therefore comprises exactly two needle passes\".\n\nLet $n_{\\text{pass}}$ be the number of needle passes per stitch location. From the explicit definition in the problem, we have:\n$$n_{\\text{pass}} = 2$$\nThis rule applies universally to all $N_{\\text{loc}} = 8$ stitch locations, as no exceptions are mentioned for the starting ($6$ o'clock) or ending ($12$ o'clock) stitches.\n\nFinally, the total number of needle passes, denoted as $N_{\\text{total}}$, is the product of the total number of stitch locations and the number of needle passes performed at each location.\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{loc}} \\times n_{\\text{pass}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$N_{\\text{total}} = 8 \\times 2 = 16$$\n\nTherefore, based on the geometric and surgical constraints provided, a total of $16$ needle passes are required to complete the anastomosis.",

There are no missing parameters or contradictory constraints.\n- **Realism:** The given values—initial PSA, half-life, and observed PSA—are all within a realistic range for the clinical scenario described.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains a complete and consistent set of data. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe solution process involves three primary steps:\n1. Derivation of the expected PSA concentration function, $C_{\\text{exp}}(t)$.\n2. Calculation of the expected concentration $C_{\\text{exp}}(21)$ and the associated measurement standard deviation $\\sigma(21)$.\n3. Calculation of the standardized deviation, $z$.\n\nFirst-order elimination kinetics is described by the differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = -kC $$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the concentration at time $t$ and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant. This is a separable ordinary differential equation, which can be solved by integration.\n$$ \\int_{C(0)}^{C(t)} \\frac{dC'}{C'} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k \\, dt' $$\n$$ \\ln(C(t)) - \\ln(C(0)) = -kt $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{C(t)}{C(0)}\\right) = -kt $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the solution for the concentration as a function of time:\n$$ C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt) $$\nThis expression represents the expected concentration, so we denote it as $C_{\\text{exp}}(t)$.\n\nThe rate constant $k$ is related to the half-life, $T_{1/2}$. By definition, at $t=T_{1/2}$, the concentration is half of the initial concentration, i.e., $C(T_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2} C(0)$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} C(0) = C(0) \\exp(-kT_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-kT_{1/2}) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kT_{1/2} $$\n$$ -\\ln(2) = -kT_{1/2} $$\nSolving for the rate constant $k$:\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $k$ back into the concentration equation gives the complete model for expected PSA concentration:\n$$ C_{\\text{exp}}(t) = C(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{T_{1/2}} t\\right) $$\nWe are given $C(0) = 6.4 \\text{ ng/mL}$, $T_{1/2} = 3 \\text{ days}$, and we need to find the expected concentration at $t = 21 \\text{ days}$.\n$$ C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 6.4 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3} \\times 21\\right) $$\nThe exponent simplifies to:\n$$ -\\frac{21}{3} \\ln(2) = -7 \\ln(2) = \\ln(2^{-7}) $$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$ C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 6.4 \\exp(\\ln(2^{-7})) = 6.4 \\times 2^{-7} $$\nCalculating $2^7$: $2^7 = 128$.\n$$ C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 6.4 \\times \\frac{1}{128} = \\frac{6.4}{128} = \\frac{64}{1280} = \\frac{1}{20} = 0.05 $$\nThe expected PSA concentration at day $21$ is $C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 0.05 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the standard deviation of the measurement at $t=21$. The problem states $\\sigma(t) = \\text{CV} \\times C(t)$, where $C(t)$ is the true concentration. When evaluating the deviation from a model, the standard deviation of the measurement error is estimated using the model-predicted (expected) concentration as the best estimate of the true value.\n$$ \\sigma(21) = \\text{CV} \\times C_{\\text{exp}}(21) $$\nGiven $\\text{CV} = 0.10$ and $C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 0.05 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n$$ \\sigma(21) = 0.10 \\times 0.05 = 0.005 $$\nThe standard deviation of the measurement is $\\sigma(21) = 0.005 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the standardized deviation, $z$, using the given formula:\n$$ z = \\frac{C_{\\text{obs}}(21) - C_{\\text{exp}}(21)}{\\sigma(21)} $$\nWe have the observed value $C_{\\text{obs}}(21) = 0.07 \\text{ ng/mL}$, the expected value $C_{\\text{exp}}(21) = 0.05 \\text{ ng/mL}$, and the standard deviation $\\sigma(21) = 0.005 \\text{ ng/mL}$.\n$$ z = \\frac{0.07 - 0.05}{0.005} = \\frac{0.02}{0.005} = \\frac{20}{5} = 4 $$\nThe calculated value of $z$ is exactly $4$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the value is expressed as $4.00$.",
