Before any surgical planning can commence, the surgeon must be able to accurately calculate maximum allowable doses to prevent systemic toxicity.

            "problem": "A patient with chronic pilonidal disease is scheduled for outpatient excision with off-midline closure under local infiltration anesthesia. The plan is to use lidocaine with epinephrine for field block and tumescent infiltration to reduce bleeding and improve operative conditions. The patient is an otherwise healthy adult with a body mass of $60$ kg, normal hepatic function, and no concurrent use of other local anesthetics. For lidocaine with epinephrine, use the widely accepted maximum recommended dose of $7$ mg/kg. The anesthetic to be used is $1\\%$ lidocaine with epinephrine at a standard dilution (for the purpose of this calculation, only the lidocaine concentration matters).\n\nStarting from first principles about concentration and dose, and using only the given maximum recommended dose, compute the maximum total lidocaine dose in milligrams and derive the corresponding maximum allowable total volume in milliliters of the $1\\%$ solution that can be safely infiltrated in a single session.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary parameters for the calculation are provided and are consistent with established medical and pharmacological principles.\n\nThe solution is derived in two sequential steps: first, calculating the maximum total dose of lidocaine in milligrams, and second, using this dose to determine the corresponding maximum volume of the anesthetic solution in milliliters.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Maximum Total Lidocaine Dose**\n\nThe problem provides the patient's body mass and the maximum recommended dose of lidocaine with epinephrine per unit of body mass. The maximum total dose, denoted as $D_{\\text{max}}$, can be calculated by multiplying the patient's mass by the maximum dose per kilogram.\n\nLet $m$ be the patient's body mass, and let $d_{\\text{max\\_per\\_kg}}$ be the maximum recommended dose per kilogram. The given values are:\n- Patient body mass, $m = 60 \\text{ kg}$.\n- Maximum recommended dose, $d_{\\text{max\\_per\\_kg}} = 7 \\text{ mg/kg}$.\n\nThe formula for the maximum total dose is:\n$$ D_{\\text{max}} = m \\times d_{\\text{max\\_per\\_kg}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ D_{\\text{max}} = 60 \\text{ kg} \\times 7 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} $$\nThe units of kilograms ($\\text{kg}$) cancel out, leaving the dose in milligrams ($\\text{mg}$).\n$$ D_{\\text{max}} = 420 \\text{ mg} $$\n\nThus, the maximum total dose of lidocaine that can be safely administered to this patient is $420$ milligrams.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Maximum Allowable Volume**\n\nThe next step is to determine the volume of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution that contains this maximum dose. This requires first determining the concentration of the solution in milligrams per milliliter ($\\text{mg/mL}$).\n\nThe problem defines a $1\\%$ solution as $1$ gram of solute per $100$ milliliters of solution. Let $C$ be the concentration.\n$$ C = \\frac{1 \\text{ gram}}{100 \\text{ mL}} $$\n\nTo be dimensionally consistent with the dose calculated in milligrams, we must convert grams to milligrams. The conversion factor is $1 \\text{ gram} = 1000 \\text{ milligrams}$.\n$$ C = \\frac{1 \\text{ g} \\times 1000 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{g}}}{100 \\text{ mL}} = \\frac{1000 \\text{ mg}}{100 \\text{ mL}} $$\nSimplifying this fraction gives the concentration in $\\text{mg/mL}$:\n$$ C = 10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} $$\n\nThe relationship between total dose ($D$), concentration ($C$), and volume ($V$) is:\n$$ D = C \\times V $$\n\nTo find the maximum allowable volume, $V_{\\text{max}}$, we rearrange this formula and use the maximum total dose, $D_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{max}}}{C} $$\n\nSubstituting the values for $D_{\\text{max}}$ and $C$:\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{420 \\text{ mg}}{10 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}} $$\nThe units of milligrams ($\\text{mg}$) cancel, leaving the volume in milliliters ($\\text{mL}$).\n$$ V_{\\text{max}} = 42 \\text{ mL} $$\n\nTherefore, the maximum allowable total volume of the $1\\%$ lidocaine solution is $42$ milliliters.\n\nThe final answer requires both the dose in milligrams and the volume in milliliters, expressed as a row matrix. The first entry is the dose ($420$ mg) and the second is the volume ($42$ mL).",

The language is objective and precise. The provided geometric properties (a rhombus with $60^{\\circ}$ and $120^{\\circ}$ angles and a specified side length) are self-contained and sufficient to determine a unique solution for the requested parameters. The problem is well-posed, verifiable, and free of contradictions or fallacies.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for three geometric properties of a Limberg flap designed to cover a rhomboid defect. The defect is a rhombus with side length $s = 5$ cm and internal angles of $60^{\\circ}$ and $120^{\\circ}$. The flap is congruent to the defect.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Rhombus Geometry**\nA rhombus is a quadrilateral with four equal sides. A rhombus with internal angles of $60^{\\circ}$ and $120^{\\circ}$ has a specific structure: it can be constructed by joining two identical equilateral triangles along a common side.\n\nLet the rhombus be denoted by the vertices $A, B, C, D$. Let it be formed by two equilateral triangles, $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle CBD$, sharing the side $BD$.\n- The sides of the equilateral triangles are equal to the side of the rhombus, $s$. So, $AB = BC = CD = DA = BD = s$.\n- The angles of the rhombus can be determined. The angles at vertices $A$ and $C$ correspond to the angles of the equilateral triangles, so $\\angle A = 60^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle C = 60^{\\circ}$.\n- The angles at vertices $B$ and $D$ are formed by the sum of two $60^{\\circ}$ angles from the equilateral triangles. Thus, $\\angle B = \\angle ABD + \\angle CBD = 60^{\\circ} + 60^{\\circ} = 120^{\\circ}$, and similarly $\\angle D = 120^{\\circ}$.\nThis construction correctly produces a rhombus with the specified angles.\n\nThe diagonals of this rhombus are $AC$ and $BD$.\n- The diagonal $BD$ is the common side of the two equilateral triangles, so its length is $s$. This diagonal connects the two $120^{\\circ}$ vertices. This is the **short diagonal**.\n- The diagonal $AC$ connects the two $60^{\\circ}$ vertices. We can find its length using the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle ABC$, where $AB=s$, $BC=s$, and $\\angle B = 120^{\\circ}$.\n$$ (d_{long})^2 = s^2 + s^2 - 2(s)(s)\\cos(120^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ (d_{long})^2 = 2s^2 - 2s^2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 2s^2 + s^2 = 3s^2 $$\n$$ d_{long} = \\sqrt{3s^2} = s\\sqrt{3} $$\nThis is the **long diagonal**.\n\n**2. Computation of Flap Dimensions**\n\n**Flap Side Length:**\nThe problem states that the flap is geometrically congruent to the defect. The defect's side length is given as $s=5$ cm. Therefore, the flap side length is also $5$ cm.\n\n**Flap Long Diagonal Length:**\nThe flap is congruent to the defect, so its diagonals are identical to the defect's diagonals. Using the derived formula for the long diagonal with $s=5$ cm:\n$$ d_{long} = s\\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3} \\text{ cm} $$\n\n**3. Computation of the Rotation Angle**\n\nThe problem specifies that the flap is \"transposed across the short diagonal\". In the context of a Limberg flap, this describes the surgical maneuver. A flap is incised from tissue adjacent to the defect and rotated on a pivot point (the pedicle) to cover the defect.\n\nLet the defect be the rhombus $ABCD$ (with $\\angle B = \\angle D = 120^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle A = \\angle C = 60^{\\circ}$). Let's assume the flap is based at vertex $C$ and cut from tissue adjacent to side $CD$. The standard technique, which is consistent with the problem's geometric description, involves rotating the flap to bring one of its sides into the position of an adjacent side of the defect.\n\nThe flap is mobilized by rotating it around a pivot point, which is typically a vertex at the base of the flap. Let this pivot be vertex $C$. The flap, when rotated, will cover the defect $ABCD$. For this to happen, the side $CD$ of the flap (which before rotation is adjacent to the defect) must be moved to occupy the position of the side $CB$ of the defect.\n\nThe angle of rotation is therefore the angle between the initial position of this side (vector $\\vec{CD}$) and its final position (vector $\\vec{CB}$). This angle is $\\angle DCB$.\n\nFrom our analysis of the rhombus geometry, the vertex $C$ has an internal angle of $60^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the angle of rotation required to transpose the flap is:\n$$ \\text{Rotation Angle} = \\angle DCB = 60^{\\circ} $$\nThis angle is fundamental to the Limberg flap design, which relies on the properties of equilateral triangles. A rotation of $60^{\\circ}$ perfectly aligns the congruent rhomboid flap into the defect space.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- Flap side length: $5$ cm.\n- Flap long diagonal length: $5\\sqrt{3}$ cm.\n- Rotation angle for transposition: $60^{\\circ}$.\n\nThese values are to be presented in a single row matrix.",

            "problem": "A patient with chronic pilonidal disease undergoes off-midline flap closure with a closed-suction drain placed in the subcutaneous space to prevent fluid accumulation. In standard surgical practice, safe drain removal is guided by two accepted principles: (i) lower drain outputs reduce the risk of seroma and hematoma formation after closure, and (ii) removal is considered when the most recent $24$-hour output is below a protocol-defined threshold and the outputs demonstrate a consistent downward trend, indicating resolving dead space. For this case, the institutional protocol defines the removal threshold as strictly less than $20 \\ \\text{mL}/\\text{day}$, and operationalizes a consistent downward trend as a monotone nonincreasing sequence of daily outputs (no day’s output exceeds any previous day’s output).\n\nDaily drain outputs over the first $5$ postoperative days, measured over successive $24$-hour intervals, are observed as follows: day $1$: $40 \\ \\text{mL}$, day $2$: $30 \\ \\text{mL}$, day $3$: $20 \\ \\text{mL}$, day $4$: $15 \\ \\text{mL}$, day $5$: $10 \\ \\text{mL}$.\n\nUsing only the above principles and definitions as the starting point, model the removal decision as finding the smallest day index $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ such that the two conditions hold simultaneously by day $t$:\n1.
