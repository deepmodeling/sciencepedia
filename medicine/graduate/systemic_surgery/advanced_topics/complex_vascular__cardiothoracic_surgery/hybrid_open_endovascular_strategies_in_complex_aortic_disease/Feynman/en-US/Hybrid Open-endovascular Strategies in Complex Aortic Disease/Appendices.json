In procedures requiring extensive angiography, the threat of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI) is a primary concern, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction.

The use of a ratio of contrast volume to eGFR is a recognized method for assessing the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). The values provided for eGFR ($40\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^{2}$), contrast volume ($120\\,\\text{mL}$), and the risk threshold ($3$) are clinically plausible and realistic for the described scenario.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The logic for determining the number of stages $N$ is explicitly defined.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, free of subjective or opinion-based content.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. There are no missing data or contradictory constraints.\n5.  **Formalizability**: The problem can be directly translated into a formal mathematical calculation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of a dimensionless risk index, its comparison to a given threshold, and a determination of the number of procedural stages based on this comparison.\n\nLet $V$ represent the total contrast volume and $E$ represent the patient's Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR). Let $R$ be the dimensionless risk index. The problem provides the following values:\n$$V = 120\\,\\text{mL}$$\n$$E = 40\\,\\text{mL/min}/1.73\\,\\text{m}^{2}$$\nThe institutional threshold for the risk index is given as:\n$$T = 3$$\nThe risk index $R$ is defined as the ratio of the total contrast volume to the eGFR. Note that in clinical practice, this ratio is calculated using the numerical values of the quantities, rendering it dimensionless as stated.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{numerical value of }V}{\\text{numerical value of }E}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R = \\frac{120}{40}$$\n$$R = 3$$\n\nThe first part of the task is to compute this ratio, which is $3$.\n\nThe second part of the task is to determine whether this ratio exceeds the threshold, $T$. We compare the calculated ratio $R=3$ to the threshold $T=3$. The condition for exceeding the threshold is $R > T$. In this case, $3 > 3$ is a false statement. The ratio $R$ is equal to the threshold $T$, but it does not exceed it.\n\nThe third part of the task is to determine the minimum number of stages, $N$. The rule is stated as: \"if it exceeds the threshold, compute the minimum integer number of stages $N$...; if it does not exceed the threshold, set $N=1$\".\nSince the calculated ratio $R = 3$ does not exceed the threshold $T = 3$, we apply the second part of the rule.\nTherefore, the number of stages is:\n$$N = 1$$\n\nThe final instruction is to report only the computed contrast volume-to-eGFR ratio. This is the value of $R$.\n$$R = 3$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity as required by the problem statement.",

In thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), particularly in the challenging environment of the aortic arch, achieving a durable proximal seal is paramount for long-term success. This practice  delves into the critical concept of stent graft oversizing, requiring you to apply manufacturer guidelines to balance the need for an effective seal against the risk of iatrogenic aortic injury.",

Preoperative imaging shows an ascending aortic diameter of $36\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ at the intended sealing zone.

Express the final value without units.\n\nFor clinical context, assume thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is performed after open debranching, with the ascending aorta serving as the proximal landing zone. Use well-established surgical principles and definitions to justify the selection, and base the calculation on diametric oversizing.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to determine a unique solution. The context and parameters provided are consistent with established clinical practices in cardiovascular surgery for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Therefore, I will proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe core task is to select an endograft from a given set of nominal diameters that best fits a specified oversizing requirement for an aorta of a known diameter.\n\nFirst, let us define the variables and parameters provided in the problem statement.\nThe diameter of the native ascending aorta at the intended proximal landing zone is given as $D_{\\text{native}} = 36\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe set of available nominal graft diameters is $D_{\\text{graft}} \\in \\{38, 40, 42\\}\\ \\mathrm{mm}$. Let us denote these as $D_1 = 38$, $D_2 = 40$, and $D_3 = 42$.\nThe recommended oversizing range is from $10\\%$ to $20\\%$. In decimal form, this range is $[0.10, 0.20]$. Let the lower bound be $O_{\\min} = 0.10$ and the upper bound be $O_{\\max} = 0.20$.\n\nThe definition of diametric oversizing, $O$, is the relative increase of the device diameter compared to the native vessel diameter. This is formally expressed as:\n$$O = \\frac{D_{\\text{graft}} - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}}$$\n\nThe problem requires selecting the candidate graft that satisfies two conditions:\n1.  Its calculated oversizing, $O$, must fall within the recommended range: $O_{\\min} \\le O \\le O_{\\max}$.\n2.  Among the grafts that satisfy the first condition, we must select the one whose oversizing is closest to the midpoint of the recommended range.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the midpoint of the recommended oversizing range, which we will denote as $O_{\\text{target}}$.\n$$O_{\\text{target}} = \\frac{O_{\\min} + O_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{0.10 + 0.20}{2} = 0.15$$\n\nNext, we will calculate the oversizing for each available graft diameter and check if it falls within the acceptable range $[0.10, 0.20]$.\n\nFor the first candidate graft, $D_1 = 38\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_1 = \\frac{D_1 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{38 - 36}{36} = \\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{1}{18} \\approx 0.0556$$\nThe value $O_1 \\approx 0.0556$ is less than the minimum required oversizing of $O_{\\min} = 0.10$. Therefore, the $38\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is not a suitable candidate as it does not meet the manufacturer's instructions for use.\n\nFor the second candidate graft, $D_2 = 40\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_2 = \\frac{D_2 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{40 - 36}{36} = \\frac{4}{36} = \\frac{1}{9} \\approx 0.1111$$\nThe value $O_2 \\approx 0.1111$ is between $0.10$ and $0.20$. Thus, $O_{\\min} \\le O_2 \\le O_{\\max}$. The $40\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is a valid candidate.\n\nFor the third candidate graft, $D_3 = 42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$O_3 = \\frac{D_3 - D_{\\text{native}}}{D_{\\text{native}}} = \\frac{42 - 36}{36} = \\frac{6}{36} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667$$\nThe value $O_3 \\approx 0.1667$ is also between $0.10$ and $0.20$. Thus, $O_{\\min} \\le O_3 \\le O_{\\max}$. The $42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is also a valid candidate.\n\nNow we must choose between the two valid candidates, the $40\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft and the $42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft, by determining which one has an oversizing value closer to the target midpoint, $O_{\\text{target}} = 0.15$. We evaluate the absolute difference between each candidate's oversizing and the target value.\n\nFor the $40\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft ($O_2 = \\frac{1}{9}$):\n$$\\text{Deviation}_2 = |O_2 - O_{\\text{target}}| = \\left|\\frac{1}{9} - 0.15\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{15}{100}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{9} - \\frac{3}{20}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{20 - 27}{180}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{7}{180}\\right| = \\frac{7}{180} \\approx 0.0389$$\n\nFor the $42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft ($O_3 = \\frac{1}{6}$):\n$$\\text{Deviation}_3 = |O_3 - O_{\\text{target}}| = \\left|\\frac{1}{6} - 0.15\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{15}{100}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{6} - \\frac{3}{20}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{10 - 9}{60}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{1}{60}\\right| = \\frac{1}{60} \\approx 0.0167$$\n\nComparing the two deviations:\n$$\\text{Deviation}_3 \\approx 0.0167 < \\text{Deviation}_2 \\approx 0.0389$$\nThe deviation for the $42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft is smaller. Therefore, the $42\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ graft best aligns with the midpoint of the recommended oversizing range while remaining within that range.\n\nThe problem asks for the oversizing of the selected device, which is $O_3$, reported as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$O_3 = \\frac{1}{6} = 0.16666...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.1667$.",

            "introduction": "Complex hybrid aortic repairs are not merely a sequence of technical steps, but a carefully choreographed operation where the order of events has profound physiological consequences. During visceral debranching, minimizing warm ischemia time to the kidneys and gut is a key determinant of postoperative outcomes. This problem  presents a logic-based challenge in surgical sequencing, tasking you with devising a plan that protects organ function by intelligently ordering the anastomoses.",

            "problem": "A patient with a pararenal aortic aneurysm is scheduled for a hybrid open–endovascular repair that includes visceral debranching. The plan uses a retrograde inflow conduit from the right common iliac artery to supply the visceral branches. To create the inflow and perform a retrograde bypass to the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA), a supraceliac aortic cross-clamp will be applied during the SMA anastomosis. Assume that the supraceliac clamp interrupts native renal perfusion unless a renal bypass has already been constructed and connected to the iliac inflow. Each renal artery bypass requires isolation of the target renal artery with 20 minutes of warm ischemia. The SMA anastomosis requires 25 minutes with the supraceliac clamp in place. Warm ischemia time is defined as the integral over time of an indicator function that is equal to one when arterial inflow to the organ is interrupted and zero otherwise.\n\nThe initially proposed intraoperative sequence is: SMA bypass first, then right renal bypass, then left renal bypass. Using the provided durations and the physiologic definition of warm ischemia time, compute the total warm ischemia times for the right and left kidneys under the initial sequence.\n\nThen, by reordering the sequence without changing task durations or inflow sources, propose a staging that ensures each kidney’s total warm ischemia remains strictly below 30 minutes. For your proposed sequence, compute the ordered pair of total warm ischemia times ($T_R, T_L$) in minutes. Express the final ordered pair in minutes. No rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "The problem presents a surgical scheduling scenario and requires the calculation of organ ischemia times based on the sequence of procedural steps. We must first validate the problem statement.\n\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of vascular surgery and physiology, specifically concerning aortic aneurysm repair and organ ischemia. All necessary data (procedural durations, conditions for ischemia) are provided, making the problem self-contained and well-posed. The language is objective and precise. The problem is a formalizable logic puzzle that requires no information beyond what is given.\n\nLet us define the three core surgical tasks:\n1.  $A_{SMA}$: The anastomosis of the Superior Mesenteric Artery (SMA). This task requires a supraceliac aortic cross-clamp for a duration of $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes.\n2.  $B_R$: The bypass of the right renal artery. This task involves isolation of the artery, causing warm ischemia to the right kidney for a duration of $t_R = 20$ minutes.\n3.  $B_L$: The bypass of the left renal artery. This task involves isolation of the artery, causing warm ischemia to the left kidney for a duration of $t_L = 20$ minutes.\n\nThe key rule governing ischemia from the supraceliac clamp is: \"The supraceliac clamp interrupts native renal perfusion unless a renal bypass has already been constructed and connected to the iliac inflow.\"\n\nThis leads to the following conditions for the total warm ischemia time for each kidney, denoted as $T_R$ for the right kidney and $T_L$ for the left kidney.\n\n-   The right kidney is ischemic for a duration $t_R = 20$ minutes during the procedure $B_R$. This is an intrinsic part of the task.\n-   The left kidney is ischemic for a duration $t_L = 20$ minutes during the procedure $B_L$. This is an intrinsic part of the task.\n-   During the SMA anastomosis ($A_{SMA}$), the right kidney experiences an additional $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes of ischemia if, and only if, its own bypass ($B_R$) has not yet been completed.\n-   Similarly, during $A_{SMA}$, the left kidney experiences an additional $t_{SMA} = 25$ minutes of ischemia if, and only if, its own bypass ($B_L$) has not yet been completed.\n\nThe total warm ischemia time for each kidney is the sum of the durations of all periods during which it lacks arterial inflow.\n\nFirst, we compute the total warm ischemia times for the initially proposed sequence: $A_{SMA} \\rightarrow B_R \\rightarrow B_L$.\n\n1.  **Step 1: $A_{SMA}$ (duration $25$ min)**\n    -   At this point, neither $B_R$ nor $B_L$ has been performed.\n    -   The supraceliac clamp causes ischemia in both kidneys.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $25$ minutes to $T_R$ and $25$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n2.  **Step 2: $B_R$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The right kidney is ischemic by definition of the procedure.\n    -   The supraceliac clamp is not applied during this step, so the left kidney has its native perfusion.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $20$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n3.  **Step 3: $B_L$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The left kidney is ischemic by definition of the procedure.\n    -   The right renal bypass ($B_R$) is now complete, so the right kidney is perfused from the iliac inflow, independent of native supraceliac flow.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $20$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\nThe total warm ischemia times for the initial sequence are:\n$$T_{R, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 45 \\text{ min}$$\n$$T_{L, \\text{initial}} = 25 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} = 45 \\text{ min}$$\nThese times, $45$ minutes, exceed the clinically acceptable threshold of $30$ minutes mentioned in the problem.\n\nNext, we must propose a reordered sequence to ensure each kidney's total warm ischemia remains strictly below $30$ minutes. The analysis of the initial sequence reveals that the significant ischemic penalty ($25$ minutes for both kidneys) arises from performing the SMA anastomosis before protecting the kidneys with their respective bypasses. The logical strategy is to perform both renal bypasses *before* the SMA anastomosis. This sequesters the ischemia from the supraceliac clamp, as both kidneys will be perfused via their newly created bypass grafts.\n\nLet us propose the following sequence: $B_R \\rightarrow B_L \\rightarrow A_{SMA}$.\n\n1.  **Step 1: $B_R$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The right kidney is ischemic during its own bypass procedure.\n    -   The left kidney is not affected.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $20$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n2.  **Step 2: $B_L$ (duration $20$ min)**\n    -   The left kidney is ischemic during its own bypass procedure.\n    -   The right kidney's bypass is complete, so it is perfused and not ischemic.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $20$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\n3.  **Step 3: $A_{SMA}$ (duration $25$ min)**\n    -   The supraceliac clamp is applied.\n    -   However, both $B_R$ and $B_L$ have been completed. Both kidneys are perfused via their bypass grafts from the iliac inflow.\n    -   Therefore, neither kidney experiences ischemia during this step.\n    -   Ischemic contribution: $0$ minutes to $T_R$ and $0$ minutes to $T_L$.\n\nThe total warm ischemia times for this proposed sequence are:\n$$T_R = 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 20 \\text{ min}$$\n$$T_L = 0 \\text{ min} + 20 \\text{ min} + 0 \\text{ min} = 20 \\text{ min}$$\nBoth $T_R = 20$ minutes and $T_L = 20$ minutes are strictly less than $30$ minutes. This sequence is therefore valid. The alternate sequence $B_L \\rightarrow B_R \\rightarrow A_{SMA}$ would yield the same result.\n\nThe problem asks for the ordered pair of total warm ischemia times ($T_R, T_L$) for the proposed sequence. This is $(20, 20)$.",
