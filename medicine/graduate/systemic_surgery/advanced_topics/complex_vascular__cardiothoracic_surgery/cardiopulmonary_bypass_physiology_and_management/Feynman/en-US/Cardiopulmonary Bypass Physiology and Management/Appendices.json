The pump sets systemic flow, $Q$. Flow is steady-state and incompressible. Compliance and inertial effects are negligible. Central venous pressure (CVP) is fixed.\n- **Fundamental Relation**: Pressure drop across a resistor equals flow times resistance.\n- **Variables**: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), pump flow ($Q$), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), central venous pressure (CVP).\n- **Constants for numerical calculation**: SVR = $900 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-5}$, CVP = $5$ mmHg, target MAP = $70$ mmHg.\n- **Unit Conversions**: $1 \\text{ mmHg} = 1333 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}$, $1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3$, $1 \\text{ min} = 60$ s.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem uses the well-established Ohm's law analogy for hemodynamics ($\\Delta P = Q \\times R$), a cornerstone of cardiovascular physiology. This simplification is standard and appropriate for modeling the macroscopic behavior of the circulatory system under the controlled, non-pulsatile flow conditions of CPB. The given numerical values for SVR, CVP, and MAP are physiologically realistic for an adult patient.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

The second part provides sufficient data (target MAP, CVP, SVR, and conversion factors) to calculate a unique value for the unknown variable, $Q$.\n- **Objectivity and Clarity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from physiology and fluid dynamics. There is no ambiguity in the definitions or the tasks required.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Qualitative Analysis**\n\nThe problem states that we must start from the fundamental hemodynamic relation that the pressure drop across a resistor equals flow times resistance. Let the pressure drop be denoted by $\\Delta P$, the flow by $Q$, and the resistance by SVR. The relation is:\n$$ \\Delta P = Q \\times \\text{SVR} $$\nIn the context of systemic circulation, the pressure drops from the mean pressure in the large arteries (proximal to the resistance), which is the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), to the mean pressure in the large veins (distal to the resistance), which is the Central Venous Pressure (CVP). Therefore, the pressure drop $\\Delta P$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta P$ into the fundamental relation yields:\n$$ \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP} = Q \\times \\text{SVR} $$\nTo find how MAP depends on the pump flow $Q$, we rearrange this equation to solve for MAP:\n$$ \\text{MAP}(Q) = (\\text{SVR}) \\cdot Q + \\text{CVP} $$\nThis equation describes the relationship between MAP and $Q$ when SVR and CVP are held constant.\n\nThis relationship is linear, of the form $y = mx + b$, where:\n- The dependent variable $y$ is the Mean Arterial Pressure, MAP.\n- The independent variable $x$ is the pump flow, $Q$.\n- The slope of the line, $m$, is the Systemic Vascular Resistance, SVR.\n- The y-intercept of the line, $b$, is the Central Venous Pressure, CVP.\n\nQualitatively, this linear relationship means that for every incremental change in pump flow $Q$, the MAP changes by a proportional amount, assuming SVR and CVP remain constant. The rate of this change is determined by the SVR; a higher SVR results in a greater increase in MAP for the same increase in flow. The CVP represents the baseline pressure in the arterial system, which would be the theoretical MAP if the pump flow were reduced to zero.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to find the pump flow $Q$ required to achieve a MAP of $70$ mmHg, given an SVR of $900 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-5}$ and a CVP of $5$ mmHg. We use the rearranged formula for $Q$:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}}{\\text{SVR}} $$\nThe units must be consistent. The SVR is given in CGS units (centimeter-gram-second), specifically $\\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-5}$. Therefore, we must convert the pressures MAP and CVP from mmHg to the CGS unit of pressure, $\\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}$, using the provided conversion factor $1 \\text{ mmHg} = 1333 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the pressure drop, $\\Delta P = \\text{MAP} - \\text{CVP}$, in mmHg:\n$$ \\Delta P = 70 \\text{ mmHg} - 5 \\text{ mmHg} = 65 \\text{ mmHg} $$\nNext, convert this pressure drop to $\\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{dyn}} = 65 \\text{ mmHg} \\times \\frac{1333 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}}{1 \\text{ mmHg}} = 86645 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2} $$\nNow we can calculate the flow $Q$ in CGS units ($\\text{cm}^3 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$):\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{dyn}}}{\\text{SVR}} = \\frac{86645 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-2}}{900 \\, \\text{dyn} \\cdot \\text{s} \\cdot \\text{cm}^{-5}} \\approx 96.2722 \\, \\text{cm}^3 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} $$\nThe final answer must be expressed in liters per minute (L/min). We use the given conversion factors: $1 \\text{ L} = 1000 \\, \\text{cm}^3$ and $1 \\text{ min} = 60$ s.\n$$ Q_{\\text{L/min}} = Q_{\\text{cm}^3/\\text{s}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ L}}{1000 \\text{ cm}^3} \\times \\frac{60 \\text{ s}}{1 \\text{ min}} $$\n$$ Q_{\\text{L/min}} = 96.2722 \\, \\frac{\\text{cm}^3}{\\text{s}} \\times \\frac{60}{1000} \\frac{\\text{L} \\cdot \\text{s}}{\\text{min} \\cdot \\text{cm}^3} \\approx 5.77633 \\text{ L/min} $$\nFinally, rounding the result to three significant figures as required:\n$$ Q \\approx 5.78 \\text{ L/min} $$",

A solution will be provided.\n\n(a) Derivation of $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$ and analysis of component contributions.\n\nThe total arterial oxygen content, $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$, is the sum of oxygen chemically bound to hemoglobin and oxygen physically dissolved in the plasma.\n\n1.  **Hemoglobin-Bound Oxygen ($C_{\\text{Hb}\\text{O}_2}$)**: Based on Principle 2, the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin is the product of the hemoglobin concentration ($H_b$), the oxygen-binding capacity of hemoglobin ($k_H = 1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g}$), and the arterial oxygen saturation ($S_{aO_2}$).\n    $$C_{\\text{Hb}\\text{O}_2} = H_b \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}$$\n\n2.  **Dissolved Oxygen ($C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2}$)**: Based on Principle 1 (Henry's Law), the amount of dissolved oxygen is the product of the arterial oxygen partial pressure ($P_{a\\text{O}_2}$) and the solubility coefficient of oxygen in plasma ($\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2}$).\n    $$C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2} = \\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2}$$\n\nThe total arterial oxygen content ($C_{a\\text{O}_2}$) is the sum of these two components. The derived expression is:\n$$C_{a\\text{O}_2} = (H_b \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2})$$\nThe units for $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$ are typically $\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2$ per $\\mathrm{dL}$ of blood.\n\nNow, we calculate the components and total $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$ for the two given partial pressures. The hemoglobin-bound component is constant because $H_b$ and $S_{aO_2}$ are held constant.\n$C_{\\text{Hb}\\text{O}_2} = (8.0\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}) \\cdot (1.34\\,\\mathrm{mL/g}) \\cdot (1.00) = 10.72\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n\n**Case 1: $P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$**\nThe dissolved oxygen component is:\n$C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2, 100} = (3.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2\\,\\mathrm{dL}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 0.310\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nThe total arterial oxygen content is:\n$C_{a\\text{O}_2, 100} = C_{\\text{Hb}\\text{O}_2} + C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2, 100} = 10.72 + 0.310 = 11.03\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nAt $P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the relative contribution of dissolved oxygen is $\\frac{0.310}{11.03} \\approx 0.0281$, or $2.8\\%$.\n\n**Case 2: $P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$**\nThe dissolved oxygen component is:\n$C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2, 400} = (3.10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2\\,\\mathrm{dL}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\cdot (400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}) = 1.24\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nThe total arterial oxygen content is:\n$C_{a\\text{O}_2, 400} = C_{\\text{Hb}\\text{O}_2} + C_{\\text{dissolved }\\text{O}_2, 400} = 10.72 + 1.24 = 11.96\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\nAt $P_{a\\text{O}_2} = 400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, the relative contribution of dissolved oxygen is $\\frac{1.24}{11.96} \\approx 0.1037$, or $10.4\\%$.\n\n**Explanation**: Under the stated conditions, oxygen bound to hemoglobin is the dominant contributor to total arterial oxygen content. At a normal $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ of $100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$, dissolved oxygen accounts for less than $3\\%$ of the total. Increasing the $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ to $400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ (hyperoxia) quadruples the amount of dissolved oxygen. However, because $S_{aO_2}$ is already $1.00$, the hemoglobin component cannot increase. This increase in dissolved oxygen raises its relative contribution to about $10\\%$ of the total oxygen content, but the absolute increase in total oxygen content is modest, from $11.03$ to $11.96\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\text{O}_2/\\mathrm{dL}$.\n\n(b) Calculation of the change in systemic oxygen delivery ($\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2}$).\n\nSystemic oxygen delivery ($D_{\\text{O}_2}$) is defined by Principle 3 as:\n$$D_{\\text{O}_2} = Q \\cdot C_{a\\text{O}_2}$$\nThe change in oxygen delivery, $\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2}$, when $P_{a\\text{O}_2}$ increases from $P_{a\\text{O}_2,1}=100\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ to $P_{a\\text{O}_2,2}=400\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$ is:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2} = D_{\\text{O}_2,2} - D_{\\text{O}_2,1} = Q \\cdot C_{a\\text{O}_2,400} - Q \\cdot C_{a\\text{O}_2,100}$$\n$$\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2} = Q \\cdot (C_{a\\text{O}_2,400} - C_{a\\text{O}_2,100})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2} = Q \\cdot \\left[ \\left( (H_b \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2,2}) \\right) - \\left( (H_b \\cdot k_H \\cdot S_{aO_2}) + (\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2,1}) \\right) \\right]$$\nSince $H_b$, $k_H$, and $S_{aO_2}$ are constant, the hemoglobin-bound term cancels:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\text{O}_2} = Q \\cdot (\\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2,2} - \\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot P_{a\\text{O}_2,1}) = Q \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{O}_2} \\cdot (P_{a\\text{O}_2,2} - P_{a\\text{O}_2,1})$$\nThis shows that when hemoglobin is fully saturated, the change in oxygen delivery is determined solely by the change in the dissolved oxygen component.\n\nWe must ensure consistent units for calculation. The pump flow $Q$ is given in $\\mathrm{L/min}$ and $C_{a\\text{O}_2}$ is in $\\mathrm{mL/dL}$.

If this trend of venous return exceeding pump flow continues, the reservoir will reach its maximum capacity and overfill. This event would lead to spillage of the patient's blood into the operating room, creating a serious biohazard, contaminating the sterile field, and constituting a critical loss of blood volume from the extracorporeal circuit, which could compromise patient safety. Therefore, the primary operational risk is the imminent overfilling of the venous reservoir.\n\nThe final answer requires the volume in $\\mathrm{mL}$, rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $2700$. To express this unambiguously with four significant figures, we write it in scientific notation as $2.700 \\times 10^3$.",
