            "problem": "In a preclinical xenotransplantation study within systemic surgery, human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) binding to porcine endothelial cells is quantified by flow cytometry as the background-subtracted Median Fluorescence Intensity (MFI). Under saturating antibody conditions, the measured MFI for a given antigen class is proportional to the number of accessible epitopes, consistent with the law of mass action and standard fluorescence detection principles. Three independent xenoantigen loci—galactosyltransferase alpha 1,3 (GGTA1), cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (CMAH), and beta-1,4-N-acetyl-galactosaminyltransferase 2 (B4GALNT2)—are targeted for deletion. Assume the following:\n- Each locus deletion reduces the specific IgG binding signal by a multiplicative factor of $0.50$ relative to the pre-deletion level.\n- Reductions across loci are independent and multiplicative.\n- The instrument background (isotype control) adds a constant fluorescence offset that is subtracted to yield the specific binding signal.\n\nOn wild-type cells, the total anti-human IgG MFI is measured as $1.62 \\times 10^{5}$ relative fluorescence units (RFU), and the isotype control background is $1.20 \\times 10^{4}$ RFU. Using the assumptions above, calculate the expected residual background-subtracted human IgG binding MFI after deleting all three loci. Express your answer in RFU and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of flow cytometry and molecular biology related to xenotransplantation. All necessary data are provided, the constraints are consistent, and the terminology is precise. A unique solution can be determined through a direct calculation based on the provided model.\n\nThe core principle of the measurement is that the total measured Median Fluorescence Intensity ($MFI_{total}$) is the sum of the specific signal due to antibody binding to xenoantigens ($MFI_{specific}$) and a constant, non-specific background signal ($MFI_{bg}$).\n$$MFI_{total} = MFI_{specific} + MFI_{bg}$$\nThe problem asks for the \"background-subtracted human IgG binding MFI\", which is precisely $MFI_{specific}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the initial specific MFI for the wild-type (WT) porcine cells. We are given the total MFI for wild-type cells and the background MFI.\nLet $MFI_{total, WT}$ be the total MFI on wild-type cells, and $MFI_{bg}$ be the background MFI.\nThe specific MFI on wild-type cells, $MFI_{specific, WT}$, is:\n$$MFI_{specific, WT} = MFI_{total, WT} - MFI_{bg}$$\nThe given values are:\n$$MFI_{total, WT} = 1.62 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ RFU}$$\n$$MFI_{bg} = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ RFU}$$\nSubstituting these values:\n$$MFI_{specific, WT} = (1.62 \\times 10^{5}) - (1.20 \\times 10^{4})$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we can express both terms with the same power of $10$:\n$$MFI_{specific, WT} = (16.2 \\times 10^{4}) - (1.20 \\times 10^{4})$$\n$$MFI_{specific, WT} = (16.2 - 1.20) \\times 10^{4}$$\n$$MFI_{specific, WT} = 15.0 \\times 10^{4} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5} \\text{ RFU}$$\nThis is the initial specific binding signal that is subject to reduction by gene deletion.\n\nThe problem states that deleting each of the $N=3$ xenoantigen loci reduces the specific IgG binding signal by a multiplicative factor of $f=0.50$. The reductions are independent and multiplicative. Therefore, the total reduction factor for deleting all three loci is $f^{N}$.\n\nThe residual specific MFI after deleting all three loci, which we will denote as $MFI_{specific, KO}$ (for knockout), is calculated by applying this total reduction factor to the initial specific MFI:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = MFI_{specific, WT} \\times f^{N}$$\nWe have $MFI_{specific, WT} = 1.50 \\times 10^{5}$, $f = 0.50$, and $N = 3$.\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = (1.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times (0.50)^{3}$$\nFirst, calculate the reduction factor:\n$$(0.50)^{3} = 0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.125$$\nNow, multiply this by the initial specific MFI:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = (1.50 \\times 10^{5}) \\times 0.125$$\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = 0.1875 \\times 10^{5}$$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation, we adjust the mantissa and exponent:\n$$MFI_{specific, KO} = 1.875 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ RFU}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $1.875 \\times 10^{4}$, already has exactly four significant figures ($1$, $8$, $7$, $5$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary.\nThe expected residual background-subtracted human IgG binding MFI is $18750$ RFU.",
