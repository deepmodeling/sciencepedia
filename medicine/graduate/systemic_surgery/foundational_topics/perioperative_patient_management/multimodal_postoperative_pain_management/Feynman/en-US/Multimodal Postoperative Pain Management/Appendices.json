            "problem": "A postoperative patient following major systemic surgery is receiving an opioid component as part of a multimodal analgesia regimen that includes scheduled acetaminophen and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), with adjuvants as needed.

The concept of equianalgesia is a standard clinical tool for opioid rotation. The provided conversion ratios for hydromorphone and morphine (IV and oral routes) are consistent with widely accepted medical literature and clinical practice guidelines. The principle of dose reduction to account for incomplete cross-tolerance is a critical safety standard in pain management. The specified reduction fraction of $0.33$ (i.e., $33\\%$) is within the typical clinical range of $25\\%$ to $50\\%$. The problem scenario is a realistic and common task in postoperative pain management. Thus, the problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of data and unambiguous instructions required to arrive at a single, deterministic solution. The initial state (current IV hydromorphone dose) and the target state (adjusted oral morphine dose) are clearly defined. The conversion factors and the reduction rule are explicitly stated. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is articulated using precise, objective, and standard medical and mathematical terminology. It is devoid of subjective language, opinion, or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility. It is a formalizable and relevant quantitative problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principle of equianalgesia, which allows for the calculation of equivalent doses between different opioids and routes of administration through potency ratios.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{HM, IV}}$ be the total daily dose of IV hydromorphone, which is given as $6$ mg.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, IV}}$ be the equianalgesic daily dose of IV morphine.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}}$ be the equianalgesic daily dose of oral morphine before adjustment.\nLet $D_{\\text{M, PO, final}}$ be the final adjusted daily dose of oral morphine.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Equianalgesic Oral Morphine Dose**\n\nThe conversion from the patient's current IV hydromorphone dose to an equianalgesic oral morphine dose can be performed in two steps, using the provided potency information.\n\nFirst, we convert the IV hydromorphone dose to an equianalgesic IV morphine dose. The problem states that $1.5$ mg of IV hydromorphone is equianalgesic to $10$ mg of IV morphine. This establishes a potency ratio, $R_1$:\n$$\nR_1 = \\frac{10 \\text{ mg IV morphine}}{1.5 \\text{ mg IV hydromorphone}}\n$$\nThe equianalgesic IV morphine dose, $D_{\\text{M, IV}}$, is found by multiplying the current IV hydromorphone dose by this ratio:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, IV}} = D_{\\text{HM, IV}} \\times R_1 = 6 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{10}{1.5} = 40 \\text{ mg}\n$$\n\nSecond, we convert this IV morphine dose to an equianalgesic oral morphine dose. The problem states that $10$ mg of IV morphine is equianalgesic to $30$ mg of oral morphine. This bioavailability and potency ratio, $R_2$, is:\n$$\nR_2 = \\frac{30 \\text{ mg oral morphine}}{10 \\text{ mg IV morphine}} = 3\n$$\nThe equianalgesic oral morphine dose, $D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}}$, is found by multiplying the equianalgesic IV morphine dose by this ratio:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} = D_{\\text{M, IV}} \\times R_2 = 40 \\text{ mg} \\times 3 = 120 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can combine these steps by establishing a single conversion factor from IV hydromorphone to oral morphine. By transitivity of equianalgesia:\n$1.5$ mg IV hydromorphone $\\Leftrightarrow$ $10$ mg IV morphine\n$10$ mg IV morphine $\\Leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine\nTherefore, $1.5$ mg IV hydromorphone $\\Leftrightarrow$ $30$ mg oral morphine.\nThe combined ratio, $R_{\\text{total}}$, is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{30 \\text{ mg oral morphine}}{1.5 \\text{ mg IV hydromorphone}} = 20\n$$\nUsing this direct ratio, we calculate the equianalgesic oral morphine dose from the initial dose:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} = D_{\\text{HM, IV}} \\times R_{\\text{total}} = 6 \\text{ mg} \\times 20 = 120 \\text{ mg}\n$$\nBoth methods correctly yield an equianalgesic oral morphine dose of $120$ mg.\n\n**Part 2: Application of Dose Reduction for Incomplete Cross-Tolerance**\n\nWhen switching between opioids, patients may be more sensitive to the new opioid than suggested by equianalgesic tables. This phenomenon is known as incomplete cross-tolerance. To mitigate the risk of overdose, a prophylactic dose reduction is standard practice.\n\nThe problem specifies a reduction equal to a fraction of $0.33$ of the calculated equianalgesic dose. Let this fraction be $f = 0.33$. The amount of dose reduction, $\\Delta D$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta D = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times f = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.33\n$$\nThe final dose, $D_{\\text{M, PO, final}}$, is the equianalgesic dose minus this reduction:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} - \\Delta D = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} - (D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times f)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = D_{\\text{M, PO, equi}} \\times (1 - f)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times (1 - 0.33) = 120 \\text{ mg} \\times 0.67\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{M, PO, final}} = 80.4 \\text{ mg}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Final Answer Formatting**\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $80.4$ mg, which already has three significant figures ($8$, $0$, and $4$). Therefore, no further rounding is necessary. The final converted daily oral morphine dose is $80.4$ mg.",

The model for adjusting drug dosage based on renal function ($CL_{\\text{tot}} = CL_{\\text{r}} + CL_{\\text{nr}}$, with $CL_{\\text{r}}$ proportional to eGFR) is a standard and widely used method in clinical pharmacology.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle for maintenance dosing is that at steady state, the rate of drug administration equals the rate of drug elimination. The average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{\\text{ss,avg}}$, is given by the ratio of the dosing rate to the total systemic clearance, $CL_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nFor a drug with oral bioavailability $F$, administered as a total daily dose $D_{\\text{daily}}$, the average steady-state concentration is:\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{\\text{daily}}}{CL_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nThe problem requires that the average steady-state concentration be the same for a patient with normal renal function (subscript $N$) and a patient with impaired renal function (subscript $I$).\n$$C_{\\text{ss,avg,N}} = C_{\\text{ss,avg,I}}$$\nSubstituting the formula for each case:\n$$\\frac{F \\cdot D_N}{CL_{\\text{tot,N}}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_I}{CL_{\\text{tot,I}}}$$\nThe bioavailability $F$ is constant and can be canceled from both sides, yielding the dose-adjustment relationship:\n$$\\frac{D_N}{CL_{\\text{tot,N}}} = \\frac{D_I}{CL_{\\text{tot,I}}}$$\nSolving for the new dose, $D_I$, we get:\n$$D_I = D_N \\cdot \\frac{CL_{\\text{tot,I}}}{CL_{\\text{tot,N}}}$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the ratio of the total clearances, $\\frac{CL_{\\text{tot,I}}}{CL_{\\text{tot,N}}}$.\n\nWe are given the model $CL_{\\text{tot}} = CL_{\\text{r}} + CL_{\\text{nr}}$, where $CL_{\\text{r}}$ is renal clearance and $CL_{\\text{nr}}$ is nonrenal clearance.\n\nFor a patient with normal renal function (eGFR$_N = 100$ ml/min), the fraction of clearance that is renal is $\\phi = 0.98$.\n$$ \\phi = \\frac{CL_{\\text{r,N}}}{CL_{\\text{tot,N}}} = 0.98 $$\nFrom this, we can express the renal and nonrenal clearance components in the normal patient in terms of the total clearance, $CL_{\\text{tot,N}}$:\n$$CL_{\\text{r,N}} = \\phi \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}} = 0.98 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}}$$\n$$CL_{\\text{nr}} = CL_{\\text{tot,N}} - CL_{\\text{r,N}} = CL_{\\text{tot,N}} - (0.98 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}}) = (1 - 0.98) \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}} = 0.02 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}}$$\nThe problem states that $CL_{\\text{nr}}$ is independent of eGFR, so it is constant for both patient types.\n\nNow, we model the clearance for the patient with impaired renal function (eGFR$_I = 30$ ml/min).\nThe nonrenal clearance remains the same:\n$$CL_{\\text{nr,I}} = CL_{\\text{nr}} = 0.02 \\cdot CL_{\\text{tot,N}}$$\nThe renal clearance, $CL_{\\text{r}}$, is proportional to eGFR.
