The fundamental principle is that basal insulin is non-negotiable; it is essential for preventing life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. This exercise challenges you to apply this principle in a complex clinical scenario, weighing the risks of hypoglycemia from fasting against the competing risks of hyperglycemia from surgical stress and steroid administration to devise a safe and effective preoperative insulin plan .",

            "problem": "A patient with Type $1$ diabetes mellitus is scheduled for an elective laparoscopic colectomy at $07{:}00$ hours. He is nil per os (NPO; nil per os) after $00{:}00$. His home regimen is insulin glargine $24$ units subcutaneously at $22{:}00$ and insulin lispro before meals. He has chronic kidney disease (CKD; chronic kidney disease) stage $3$ with estimated glomerular filtration rate of approximately $45$ $\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73\\,m^2}$, a history of nocturnal hypoglycemia, and a last glycated hemoglobin of $8.2\\%$. He takes prednisone $10$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ daily for polymyalgia rheumatica. The surgical team plans perioperative stress-dose glucocorticoids: hydrocortisone $100$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous at induction, followed by $50$ $\\mathrm{mg}$ intravenous every $8$ hours for $24$ hours. His fasting capillary blood glucose at $05{:}30$ is $95$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n\nGiven the physiologic basis of basal insulin (to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, lipolysis, and ketogenesis) and the effects of fasting, surgical stress, and exogenous glucocorticoids on counterregulatory hormones and insulin sensitivity, choose the most appropriate preoperative basal insulin plan for the evening prior to surgery and immediate perioperative period. The goal is to avoid hypoglycemia while preventing ketosis and excessive hyperglycemia, with typical perioperative targets of $140$–$180$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ endorsed by major societies. Consider that long-acting basal insulin should generally be continued in Type $1$ diabetes, reduced proportionally when NPO, and titrated in the context of renal function and steroid-induced insulin resistance.\n\nWhich of the following plans best balances hypoglycemia risk and anticipated stress hyperglycemia in this patient?\n\nA.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient**: A patient with Type $1$ diabetes mellitus (T1DM).\n-   **Procedure**: Elective laparoscopic colectomy.\n-   **Home Regimen**: Insulin glargine $24$ units at night, plus mealtime insulin lispro.\n-   **Comorbidities**: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage $3$ (eGFR $\\approx 45$ mL/min/1.73 m$^2$), history of nocturnal hypoglycemia.\n-   **Medications**: Chronic prednisone $10$ mg daily, with planned perioperative stress-dose hydrocortisone.\n-   **Pre-op Status**: Nil per os (NPO) after midnight, with a fasting blood glucose of $95$ mg/dL at $05:30$.\n-   **Goal**: Maintain glucose in the target range of $140-180$ mg/dL while avoiding hypoglycemia and ketosis.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem presents a complex but highly realistic clinical scenario. It requires the application of core principles of endocrinology and perioperative medicine, including T1DM pathophysiology, insulin pharmacology, and the metabolic effects of fasting, renal impairment, surgical stress, and high-dose glucocorticoids.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The question asks for the \"most appropriate\" plan, which requires a nuanced clinical judgment based on balancing multiple competing risks. The provided data is sufficient to make a reasoned choice.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-constructed clinical vignette that tests critical thinking in perioperative diabetes management. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe central challenge is to balance two powerful, opposing forces: factors that increase hypoglycemia risk versus factors that will cause severe hyperglycemia.\n\n**1. Factors Increasing Hypoglycemia Risk:**\n-   **Nil Per Os (NPO) Status**: The absence of food intake significantly reduces the insulin requirement.\n-   **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)**: With an eGFR of $\\approx 45$ mL/min/1.73 m$^2$, insulin clearance is reduced, prolonging its half-life and increasing its effect. This is a major risk factor for hypoglycemia.\n-   **History of Nocturnal Hypoglycemia**: This indicates the patient is already sensitive to their basal insulin dose.\n-   **Low-Normal Morning Glucose**: A fasting glucose of $95$ mg/dL provides little buffer against a potential hypoglycemic event before the surgery starts.\nThese factors argue strongly for a significant **reduction** in the patient's usual basal insulin dose. Giving the full dose would be extremely dangerous.\n\n**2. Factors Increasing Hyperglycemia Risk:**\n-   **Surgical Stress**: The colectomy will trigger a major neuroendocrine stress response, releasing counter-regulatory hormones (catecholamines, cortisol, glucagon) that drive up blood glucose.\n-   **High-Dose Glucocorticoids**: The patient is already on chronic prednisone, and the planned perioperative hydrocortisone regimen constitutes a very large steroid dose that will cause profound insulin resistance.\nThese factors guarantee that the patient will become significantly hyperglycemic during and after surgery and will require active management with insulin.\n\n**3. Synthesizing a Safe and Effective Plan:**\nA robust plan must address both risks proactively:\n-   **Basal Insulin Dosing**: The nighttime glargine dose must be reduced to prevent pre-operative hypoglycemia. A reduction of $20-50\\%$ is standard; given the multiple risk factors (CKD, history), a reduction towards the higher end of this range is safer.\n-   **Hypoglycemia Prevention**: An intravenous dextrose infusion (e.g., D5W) should be started pre-operatively. This provides a constant source of glucose, creating a \"safety floor\" that both protects against hypoglycemia and allows for the safer administration of insulin to control hyperglycemia.\n-   **Hyperglycemia Management**: The plan must include frequent (e.g., hourly) intraoperative blood glucose monitoring and a method for rapid correction, which is intravenous (IV) insulin. The target range of $140-180$ mg/dL should be maintained.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Administer $50\\%$ of usual basal insulin... hold all intravenous dextrose, check blood glucose every $6$ hours... withhold correctional insulin unless blood glucose exceeds $250$ mg/dL.**\n-   **Analysis**: While the $50\\%$ dose reduction ($12$ units) is appropriately cautious, holding dextrose is dangerous. The infrequent monitoring (q$6$h) and the excessively high correction threshold ($>250$ mg/dL) are unsafe and do not meet the standard of care.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Administer $70\\%$ of usual basal insulin... begin $5\\%$ dextrose in water (D5W)... with hourly point-of-care blood glucose monitoring, and use intravenous regular insulin correction if blood glucose exceeds $180$ mg/dL.**\n-   **Analysis**: This plan correctly integrates all necessary components. The $70\\%$ dose ($17$ units) is a reasonable compromise, anticipating the powerful hyperglycemic effect of the steroids. The inclusion of a dextrose infusion is a critical safety feature. Hourly monitoring and a correction threshold of $180$ mg/dL are appropriate and align with modern guidelines. This represents a comprehensive, safe, and effective strategy.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Administer $80\\%$ of usual basal insulin... avoid intravenous dextrose, check blood glucose every $4$ hours, and administer subcutaneous correctional insulin...**\n-   **Analysis**: An $80\\%$ dose ($19$ units) poses a high risk of hypoglycemia pre-operatively, especially without a dextrose infusion. Monitoring every $4$ hours is insufficient. Most critically, using subcutaneous correctional insulin intraoperatively is unreliable due to variable peripheral perfusion and absorption; IV insulin is required for timely and predictable control.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Administer $100\\%$ of usual basal insulin... avoid intravenous dextrose...**\n-   **Analysis**: Administering the full basal dose ($24$ units) to an NPO patient with CKD and a history of hypoglycemia is a critical error that would almost certainly cause severe hypoglycemia before surgery.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

            "introduction": "The landscape of diabetes management is continually evolving with the introduction of new drug classes, such as Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. While beneficial for chronic management, these agents introduce unique perioperative risks that demand a deep understanding of their pathophysiology. This practice focuses on the critical reasoning required to identify the risk of euglycemic DKA, a dangerous and often-missed diagnosis, and to apply pharmacological principles to create a safe preoperative discontinuation plan .",

            "problem": "A $58$-year-old man with type $2$ diabetes mellitus is scheduled for elective laparoscopic colectomy in $4$ days. His regimen includes Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter $2$ (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin $10$ mg daily, metformin $1000$ mg twice daily, and nightly insulin glargine $20$ units. His most recent glycated hemoglobin is $7.6\\%$. He follows a relatively low-carbohydrate diet. The anesthetic plan includes an intraoperative dose of dexamethasone $8$ mg for nausea prophylaxis. He will be nil per os from midnight before surgery. His estimated glomerular filtration rate is $85$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$ consistent with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage $2$.\n\nIn contemplating the risk of perioperative euglycemic Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA), the team reviews how SGLT2 inhibition affects renal glucose handling and systemic fuel metabolism. Consider the following fundamentals:\n\n- In the proximal tubule, SGLT2 normally reabsorbs the majority of filtered glucose; when inhibited, urinary glucose excretion increases. The filtered glucose load equals $$\\text{Filtered glucose load} = GFR \\times P_{\\text{glucose}},$$ where $GFR$ is the glomerular filtration rate and $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ is the plasma glucose concentration.\n- Pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion is a monotonic increasing function of $P_{\\text{glucose}}$; lowering $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ reduces insulin secretion. Glucagon secretion rises when insulin falls, increasing the glucagon-to-insulin ratio.\n- Fasting and surgical stress increase counterregulatory hormones (including catecholamines and glucocorticoids), promote lipolysis, and enhance hepatic ketogenesis. SGLT2-mediated glycosuria can maintain near-normal $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ despite ongoing ketogenesis, predisposing to euglycemic DKA.\n- Drug elimination over successive half-lives leads to exponential decay in effect; if the half-life is $t_{1/2}$, the remaining fraction after $n$ half-lives is $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\n\nWhich of the following options best integrates the mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors predispose to euglycemic DKA and justifies the preoperative discontinuation timing for empagliflozin in this patient, given planned intraoperative glucocorticoid use?\n\nA. Continue empagliflozin through the day of surgery; counterbalance ketogenesis with an intraoperative dextrose infusion since dexamethasone will reduce stress-induced ketosis.\n\nB. Hold empagliflozin only on the morning of surgery; maintain basal insulin and frequent glucose checks, because ketosis cannot occur with near-normal plasma glucose.\n\nC. Discontinue empagliflozin $24$ hours before surgery and increase basal insulin to offset stress hyperglycemia; the short interruption suffices because glycosuria rapidly ceases when the drug is stopped.\n\nD. Discontinue empagliflozin at least $72$ hours ($3$ days) before surgery to allow multiple half-lives and attenuation of pharmacodynamic glycosuria; maintain basal insulin and monitor for ketosis, recognizing that reduced $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ from enhanced glycosuria lowers insulin secretion, raises glucagon, and—together with fasting and glucocorticoids—increases hepatic ketogenesis that can present as euglycemic DKA.\n\nE. Discontinue empagliflozin $7$ days before surgery to eliminate all risk of euglycemic DKA; defer basal insulin to avoid hypoglycemia since glycosuria will persist for weeks.",
            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\n-   **Patient**: A $58$-year-old man with type $2$ diabetes mellitus.\n-   **Procedure**: Elective laparoscopic colectomy scheduled in $4$ days.\n-   **Medications**:\n    -   Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter $2$ (SGLT2) inhibition with empagliflozin $10$ mg daily.\n    -   Metformin $1000$ mg twice daily.\n    -   Nightly insulin glargine $20$ units.\n-   **Glycemic Control**: Most recent glycated hemoglobin is $7.6\\%$.\n-   **Diet**: Relatively low-carbohydrate.\n-   **Anesthetic Plan**:\n    -   Intraoperative dose of dexamethasone $8$ mg.\n    -   Nil per os (NPO) from midnight before surgery.\n-   **Renal Function**: Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is $85$ mL/min per $1.73$ m$^2$, consistent with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) stage $2$.\n-   **Key Concepts Provided**:\n    1.  SGLT2 inhibition increases urinary glucose excretion. Filtered glucose load $= GFR \\times P_{\\text{glucose}}$.\n    2.

It accurately describes the pharmacology of SGLT2 inhibitors, the pathophysiology of euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), the metabolic effects of perioperative stressors (fasting, surgery), and the impact of exogenous glucocorticoids (dexamethasone). The clinical scenario is realistic and presents a common and important management challenge in perioperative medicine.

The information provided is sufficient to arrive at a logically sound and clinically appropriate conclusion. A unique, best answer can be determined.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, clinical language. The data and physiological principles are presented without bias or subjective interpretation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to determine the appropriate perioperative management of empagliflozin to mitigate the risk of euglycemic DKA. This requires integrating the patient's specific risk factors with the provided physiological and pharmacological principles.\n\n**1. Analysis of Pathophysiological Risk:**\n-   **SGLT2 Inhibition**: The patient is on empagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor. This drug forces renal excretion of glucose, thereby lowering plasma glucose ($P_{\\text{glucose}}$).\n-   **Hormonal Milieu**: According to the provided principles, the drug-induced lowering of $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ reduces pancreatic insulin secretion and increases glucagon secretion. This shifts the glucagon-to-insulin ratio upwards, creating a \"starvation\" signal for the liver, which strongly promotes hepatic ketogenesis.\n-   **Compounding Stressors**: The patient faces several potent ketogenic stimuli:\n    -   **Fasting**: The patient will be NPO from midnight, which is a ketogenic state.\n    -   **Surgical Stress**: The colectomy itself will elicit a significant counterregulatory hormone response (e.g., catecholamines, cortisol).\n    -   **Glucocorticoids**: The planned administration of dexamethasone $8$ mg, a potent glucocorticoid, will further increase insulin resistance and promote lipolysis and ketogenesis.\n-   **The Euglycemic DKA Trap**: The confluence of these factors creates a high-risk scenario for DKA. The SGLT2 inhibitor's primary action—glycosuria—can keep the $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ in a near-normal range (euglycemia), masking the severe underlying metabolic acidosis from ketone overproduction. This is the definition of euglycemic DKA.\n\n**2. Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Considerations:**\n-   The key to mitigating this risk is to ensure the pharmacodynamic effect of empagliflozin (i.e., significant glycosuria) has resolved before the major stressors begin.\n-   The half-life ($t_{1/2}$) of empagliflozin is approximately $12.4$ hours. The problem states that drug effect decays exponentially, with the remaining fraction after $n$ half-lives being $(\\frac{1}{2})^n$.\n-   To achieve a clinically significant reduction in drug effect (e.g., less than $5-10\\%$ remaining), multiple half-lives must pass.\n-   Let's calculate the remaining drug effect at different time points:\n    -   After $24$ hours ($\\approx 2$ half-lives): $(\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} = 25\\%$ of the effect remains.\n    -   After $48$ hours ($\\approx 4$ half-lives): $(\\frac{1}{2})^4 = \\frac{1}{16} \\approx 6.25\\%$ of the effect remains.\n    -   After $72$ hours ($\\approx 6$ half-lives): $(\\frac{1}{2})^6 = \\frac{1}{64} \\approx 1.56\\%$ of the effect remains.\n-   A discontinuation period of at least $72$ hours ($3$ days) is necessary to ensure the glycosuric effect is minimal, thereby uncoupling the ketogenic state from a misleadingly normal blood glucose. This aligns with current consensus guidelines from major endocrinology and anesthesiology societies. As the surgery is in $4$ days, a $3$-day hold is feasible.\n\n**3. Overall Management Strategy:**\n-   Discontinue empagliflozin at least $3$ days ($72$ hours) prior to surgery.\n-   Continue basal insulin (glargine) to maintain glycemic control and, critically, to suppress ketogenesis. The dose may need adjustment based on blood glucose monitoring, but stopping it would be dangerous, especially given the impending surgical and steroid-induced hyperglycemia.\n-   Monitor blood glucose and potentially ketones.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Continue empagliflozin through the day of surgery; counterbalance ketogenesis with an intraoperative dextrose infusion since dexamethasone will reduce stress-induced ketosis.**\n-   **Analysis**: This is fundamentally incorrect and dangerous. Continuing the SGLT2 inhibitor maximizes the risk of euglycemic DKA. The statement that dexamethasone reduces ketosis is the opposite of the truth; as a glucocorticoid, it is a potent stimulus for ketogenesis. Administering dextrose in the presence of an SGLT2 inhibitor creates a futile cycle of glucose infusion and urinary excretion, which does not reliably prevent ketosis.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Hold empagliflozin only on the morning of surgery; maintain basal insulin and frequent glucose checks, because ketosis cannot occur with near-normal plasma glucose.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option contains two critical errors. First, holding the drug for only a few hours is insufficient, as significant drug effect will persist intraoperatively given the $\\approx 12.4$-hour half-life. Second, the assertion that \"ketosis cannot occur with near-normal plasma glucose\" is a direct contradiction of the pathophysiology of euglycemic DKA, the very condition the problem is centered on.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Discontinue empagliflozin $24$ hours before surgery and increase basal insulin to offset stress hyperglycemia; the short interruption suffices because glycosuria rapidly ceases when the drug is stopped.**\n-   **Analysis**: While better than options A and B, this is still suboptimal. A $24$-hour hold represents only about $2$ half-lives, leaving a substantial drug effect ($\\approx 25\\%$) at the time of surgery. The claim that \"glycosuria rapidly ceases\" is incorrect; the pharmacodynamic effect wanes over several days, tracking the drug's elimination over multiple half-lives. This duration is not considered safe in the context of major surgery with additional risk factors like dexamethasone administration.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Discontinue empagliflozin at least $72$ hours ($3$ days) before surgery to allow multiple half-lives and attenuation of pharmacodynamic glycosuria; maintain basal insulin and monitor for ketosis, recognizing that reduced $P_{\\text{glucose}}$ from enhanced glycosuria lowers insulin secretion, raises glucagon, and—together with fasting and glucocorticoids—increases hepatic ketogenesis that can present as euglycemic DKA.**\n-   **Analysis**: This option provides a complete and accurate synthesis of the required clinical reasoning.\n    -   It recommends an appropriate discontinuation time ($72$ hours, or $3$ days), which allows for drug washout over approximately $6$ half-lives, consistent with clinical guidelines.\n    -   It correctly advises maintaining basal insulin as a crucial measure to suppress ketogenesis.\n    -   It flawlessly summarizes the entire pathophysiological cascade: SGLT2i causes glycosuria, which lowers $P_{\\text{glucose}}$, leading to a pro-ketogenic hormonal state (low insulin, high glucagon), which is then amplified by fasting and glucocorticoids, resulting in the risk of euglycemic DKA.\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Discontinue empagliflozin $7$ days before surgery to eliminate all risk of euglycemic DKA; defer basal insulin to avoid hypoglycemia since glycosuria will persist for weeks.**\n-   **Analysis**: This advice is flawed and potentially harmful. First, the pharmacodynamic effect of empagliflozin does not persist for weeks; it resolves over a few days. A $7$-day hold is generally considered excessive and may lead to poor glycemic control preoperatively. Second, and more importantly, deferring basal insulin in a patient with a baseline HbA1c of $7.6\\%$ facing major surgery and steroids is dangerous and would likely lead to severe hyperglycemia and possibly classic, hyperglycemic DKA. The risk of hypoglycemia after stopping the SGLT2 inhibitor should be managed by monitoring glucose and adjusting insulin doses, not by withholding insulin altogether.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

In a surgical intensive care unit, an intravenous (IV) insulin infusion protocol is applied that models the basal correction rate as linearly proportional to the hyperglycemic deviation above a target setpoint. Specifically, when the capillary blood glucose is $G$ (in mg/dL) and the target setpoint is $G_{\\text{targ}}$, the infusion rate is assumed proportional to the deviation $G - G_{\\text{targ}}$ with a proportionality coefficient $c$ (in units/hour per mg/dL).

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of two quantities related to the management of stress hyperglycemia in a perioperative patient: the basal insulin infusion rate and the expected magnitude of the glucose change over one hour. The solution must proceed from the given principles and definitions.\n\nLet $G$ be the patient's capillary blood glucose in mg/dL, and let $G_{\\text{targ}}$ be the target glucose setpoint, also in mg/dL. Let $R$ be the intravenous insulin infusion rate in units per hour. The problem states that the infusion rate is modeled as being linearly proportional to the hyperglycemic deviation, which is the difference $G - G_{\\text{targ}}$. The constant of proportionality is given as $c$. This relationship is expressed by the equation:\n$$R = c (G - G_{\\text{targ}})$$\n\nThe problem provides the following specific values:\nThe patient's measured glucose is $G = 320$ mg/dL.\nThe recommended target setpoint is $G_{\\text{targ}} = 150$ mg/dL.\nThe proportionality coefficient is $c = 0.02$ units/hour per mg/dL.\n\nTo find the basal insulin infusion rate, we substitute these values into the governing equation:\n$$R = 0.02 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}} \\times (320 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} - 150 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}})$$\nFirst, we calculate the glucose deviation:\n$$G - G_{\\text{targ}} = 320 - 150 = 170 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}}$$\nNow, we calculate the infusion rate $R$:\n$$R = 0.02 \\times 170 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$$\n$$R = 3.4 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$$\nThus, the basal insulin infusion rate is $3.4$ units/hour.\n\nNext, we must derive the expected magnitude of the one-hour glucose change. The problem defines the insulin sensitivity factor, $S$, as the drop in glucose (in mg/dL) per unit of insulin administered, over one hour. The value is given as $S = 30$ mg/dL per unit.\n\nThis means that each unit of insulin is expected to lower the blood glucose by $30$ mg/dL. The rate of change of blood glucose, which can be represented as $\\frac{dG}{dt}$, is a function of the rate at which insulin is infused, $R$, and the patient's sensitivity to it, $S$. Since insulin lowers glucose, the rate of change is negative. The relationship is:\n$$\\frac{dG}{dt} = -R \\times S$$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}) \\times (\\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{unit}}) = \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{hour}}$, which correctly represents a rate of change of glucose concentration.\n\nThe problem asks for the *magnitude* of this change, which is the absolute value of the rate:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dG}{dt} \\right| = |-R \\times S| = R \\times S$$\nUsing the previously calculated value for $R$ and the given value for $S$:\n$$R = 3.4 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}}$$\n$$S = 30 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{unit}}$$\nWe can calculate the magnitude of the glucose change rate:\n$$\\left| \\frac{dG}{dt} \\right| = 3.4 \\frac{\\text{units}}{\\text{hour}} \\times 30 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{unit}}$$\n$$\\left| \\frac{dG}{dt} \\right| = 102 \\frac{\\text{mg/dL}}{\\text{hour}}$$\nThe \"steady-state\" assumption in the definition of $S$ implies this rate is constant over the hour.
