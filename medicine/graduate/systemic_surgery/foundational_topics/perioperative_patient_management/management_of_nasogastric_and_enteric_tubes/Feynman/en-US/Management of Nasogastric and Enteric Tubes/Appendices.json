            "problem": "A tertiary surgical unit is revising its confirmation workflow for blind insertion of Nasogastric (NG) and enteric tubes. The unit mandates radiographic confirmation prior to tube use but seeks to minimize the risk of catastrophic airway misplacement during the workflow and to reduce overall false acceptance of misplacement. You are asked to construct and justify a stepwise algorithm that integrates three tests: Carbon Dioxide (CO$_2$) capnography to exclude airway placement, aspirate acidity measurement by pH testing (threshold $pH \\le 5.5$) to increase confidence in gastric placement, and mandatory radiography as the final step. Your justification must be based on error propagation considerations using fundamental probability and decision principles, not heuristics.\n\nAssume the following scientifically plausible priors and test characteristics derived from published performance estimates:\n- Pre-insertion class probabilities: true gastric placement $P(G) = 0.90$, esophageal placement $P(E) = 0.08$, airway placement $P(A) = 0.02$.\n- CO$_2$ capnography (waveform or high-quality colorimetric):\n  - Sensitivity for detecting airway placement $Se_C(A) = 0.98$.\n  - Specificity for non-airway placements $Sp_C(\\neg A) = 0.99$, that is $P(C^{-}|\\neg A) = 0.99$, where $C^{-}$ denotes \"no CO$_2$ detected.\"\n- Aspirate pH test using threshold $pH \\le 5.5$:\n  - Sensitivity for gastric $Se_p(G) = 0.80$.\n  - False low pH probabilities: $P(pH^{+}|E) = 0.05$, $P(pH^{+}|A) = 0.01$, where $pH^{+}$ denotes \"low pH\" result.\n- Radiography:\n  - Probability of a radiographic report confirming gastric location if gastric is true $P(R^{+}|G) = 0.995$.\n  - Probability of a radiographic report confirming gastric location if gastric is false (airway or esophageal) $P(R^{+}|\\neg G) = 0.001$.\n\nThe unit sets two policy goals:\n1. Before any nontrivial patient movement or delay (e.g., transport for imaging), the posterior probability of airway placement must be reduced below $10^{-3}$ for safety.\n2. Final acceptance (permission to use the tube) requires radiography and must yield a posterior probability of misplacement $P(\\neg G|\\text{all evidence}) \\le 10^{-4}$.\n\nUse Bayes’ theorem, $P(\\theta|D) = \\dfrac{P(D|\\theta)P(\\theta)}{\\sum_i P(D|\\theta_i)P(\\theta_i)}$, and the principle that, for sequential independent tests required to be passed for acceptance, the probability of erroneous acceptance propagates multiplicatively across steps, dominated by the weakest step. Construct a stepwise algorithm using the three tests and select the option whose sequence and rationale both satisfy the unit’s policy goals and correctly applies error propagation reasoning.\n\nWhich option best meets these criteria?\n\nA. Perform aspirate pH testing first, then CO$_2$ capnography, then radiography. Justification: pH has higher specificity for gastric placement than capnography does for non-airway placement; front-loading specificity reduces false positives early and minimizes error propagation.\n\nB. Perform CO$_2$ capnography first, then aspirate pH testing, then mandatory radiography. Justification: a high-sensitivity airway exclusion test reduces $P(A)$ below the safety threshold before any delay, pH improves the posterior for gastric versus esophageal, and radiography, being near-definitive, collapses residual error. The composite false acceptance is minimized by placing the most safety-critical high-sensitivity test first and the highest-accuracy test last.\n\nC. Perform radiography first, then aspirate pH testing, then CO$_2$ capnography. Justification: radiography has the highest accuracy and therefore, by error propagation, should be first to prevent accumulation of upstream errors; subsequent tests are redundant but provide ancillary confirmation.\n\nD. Perform CO$_2$ capnography first, then mandatory radiography, then aspirate pH testing. Justification: excluding airway early addresses safety, radiography finalizes placement, and pH can be added post hoc to assess acid-related feeding readiness even if radiography is already confirmatory.\n\nAnswer by choosing the single best option.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and justification of a three-test algorithm for confirming nasogastric (NG) tube placement, adhering to specific safety and accuracy goals. The algorithm must use CO$_2$ capnography, aspirate pH testing, and radiography in a sequence that is logically sound, clinically safe, and mathematically validated. A crucial constraint is that radiography must be the final step in the sequence. The options must be evaluated against these criteria using the provided prior probabilities and test performance data.\n\n### 1. Problem Validation\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of diagnostic test evaluation, mathematically formalizable using Bayesian probability theory, and well-posed with all necessary numerical data and explicit, quantitative goals. The priors and test characteristics are provided and consistent. The constraints are clear.\n\n### 2. Bayesian Framework Setup\nLet the states of the tube placement be Gastric ($G$), Esophageal ($E$), and Airway ($A$).\nThe prior probabilities are given as:\n$P(G) = 0.90$\n$P(E) = 0.08$\n$P(A) = 0.02$\nNote that $P(G) + P(E) + P(A) = 1$. The probability of misplacement is $P(\\neg G) = P(E) + P(A) = 0.10$.\n\nThe \"pass\" conditions for the workflow are a sequence of test results indicating probable gastric placement:\n- CO$_2$ capnography: $C^{-}$ (no CO$_2$ detected)\n- pH test: $pH^{+}$ (aspirate pH $\\le 5.5$)\n- Radiography: $R^{+}$ (radiographic report confirms gastric location)\n\nThe likelihoods $P(\\text{Evidence}|\\text{State})$ are:\n- **CO$_2$ Capnography ($C$):**\n  - $P(C^{-}|G) = P(C^{-}|E) = P(C^{-}|\\neg A) = 0.99$\n  - $P(C^{-}|A) = 1 - P(C^{+}|A) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n- **pH Test ($pH$):**\n  - $P(pH^{+}|G) = 0.80$\n  - $P(pH^{+}|E) = 0.05$\n  - $P(pH^{+}|A) = 0.01$\n- **Radiography ($R$):**\n  - $P(R^{+}|G) = 0.995$\n  - $P(R^{+}|E) = P(R^{+}|A) = P(R^{+}|\\neg G) = 0.001$\n\nThe policy goals are:\n1. Before transport for imaging, posterior $P(A|\\text{evidence}) < 10^{-3}$.\n2. For final acceptance, posterior $P(\\neg G|\\text{all evidence}) \\le 10^{-4}$.\n\nThe problem states that radiography must be the final step. This immediately invalidates options C (radiography first) and D (radiography second). We only need to analyze options A and B.\n\n### 3. Analysis of Option A: pH $\\rightarrow$ CO$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ Radiography\nThis sequence places radiography last, consistent with the problem constraint.\n\n**Justification Check:** The justification states, \"pH has higher specificity for gastric placement than capnography does for non-airway placement\". Let's verify this.\n- Specificity of pH test for gastric placement is $P(pH^{-}|\\neg G)$. First, we find the probability of a positive test in non-gastric placements:\n  $P(pH^{+}|\\neg G) = \\dfrac{P(pH^{+} \\cap \\neg G)}{P(\\neg G)} = \\dfrac{P(pH^{+}|E)P(E) + P(pH^{+}|A)P(A)}{P(E) + P(A)}$\n  $P(pH^{+}|\\neg G) = \\dfrac{(0.05)(0.08) + (0.01)(0.02)}{0.08 + 0.02} = \\dfrac{0.004 + 0.0002}{0.10} = 0.042$\n  The specificity is $Sp_p(\\neg G) = 1 - P(pH^{+}|\\neg G) = 1 - 0.042 = 0.958$.\n- Specificity of capnography for non-airway placement is given directly: $Sp_C(\\neg A) = P(C^{-}|\\neg A) = 0.99$.\nThe claim is $0.958 > 0.99$, which is false. Therefore, the justification for Option A is based on an incorrect premise.\n\n**Workflow Safety:** This sequence proposes aspirating for pH as the first step. If the tube is in the airway (prior probability $2\\%$), attempting to aspirate may be unsuccessful and delay the detection of this life-threatening misplacement. Performing the non-invasive CO$_2$ test first is a superior risk-management strategy.\n\nAlthough this sequence can mathematically meet the goals (as the final posterior is independent of test order), its justification is flawed and the workflow is suboptimal from a safety perspective.\n\n### 4. Analysis of Option B: CO$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ pH $\\rightarrow$ Radiography\nThis sequence also places radiography last, consistent with the constraint.\n\n**Step 1: CO$_2$ Capnography.** The test result must be $C^{-}$. We calculate the posterior probability of airway placement, $P(A|C^{-})$.\nFirst, the total probability of a negative test, $P(C^{-})$:\n$P(C^{-}) = P(C^{-}|G)P(G) + P(C^{-}|E)P(E) + P(C^{-}|A)P(A)$\n$P(C^{-}) = (0.99)(0.90) + (0.99)(0.08) + (0.02)(0.02) = 0.891 + 0.0792 + 0.0004 = 0.9706$\nUsing Bayes' theorem for the airway placement:\n$P(A|C^{-}) = \\dfrac{P(C^{-}|A)P(A)}{P(C^{-})} = \\dfrac{(0.02)(0.02)}{0.9706} = \\dfrac{0.0004}{0.9706} \\approx 4.12 \\times 10^{-4}$\n\n**Policy Goal 1 Check:** The goal is $P(A|\\text{evidence}) < 10^{-3}$ before transport for imaging.\nSince $4.12 \\times 10^{-4} < 10^{-3}$, this goal is met. Performing capnography first successfully reduces the risk of airway misplacement to an acceptable level before any delay or patient movement.\n\n**Step 2 & 3: pH Test and Radiography.** The full sequence of \"pass\" results is $D_{all} = (C^{-}, pH^{+}, R^{+})$. We need to calculate the final posterior probability of misplacement, $P(\\neg G | D_{all})$.\nFor a sequence of conditionally independent tests, the final posterior $P(\\theta|D_{all})$ is proportional to the product of the likelihoods and the prior, $P(D_{all}|\\theta)P(\\theta) = P(C^{-}|\\theta)P(pH^{+}|\\theta)P(R^{+}|\\theta)P(\\theta)$.\n\n- For gastric placement ($G$): $P(D_{all}|G)P(G) = (0.99)(0.80)(0.995)(0.90) = 0.709236$\n- For esophageal placement ($E$): $P(D_{all}|E)P(E) = (0.99)(0.05)(0.001)(0.08) = 3.96 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- For airway placement ($A$): $P(D_{all}|A)P(A) = (0.02)(0.01)(0.001)(0.02) = 4 \\times 10^{-9}$\n\nThe total probability of passing all three tests is the sum of these values:\n$P(D_{all}) = 0.709236 + 3.96 \\times 10^{-6} + 4 \\times 10^{-9} \\approx 0.70923996$\n\nThe posterior probability of misplacement is $P(\\neg G|D_{all}) = P(E|D_{all}) + P(A|D_{all})$.\n$P(E|D_{all}) = \\dfrac{3.96 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.70923996} \\approx 5.58 \\times 10^{-6}$\n$P(A|D_{all}) = \\dfrac{4 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.70923996} \\approx 5.64 \\times 10^{-9}$\n$P(\\neg G|D_{all}) \\approx 5.58 \\times 10^{-6} + 5.64 \\times 10^{-9} \\approx 5.59 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\n**Policy Goal 2 Check:** The goal is $P(\\neg G|\\text{all evidence}) \\le 10^{-4}$.\nSince $5.59 \\times 10^{-6} \\le 10^{-4}$, this goal is also met.\n\n**Justification Check:**\n- \"a high-sensitivity airway exclusion test reduces $P(A)$ below the safety threshold...\" - Correct. The test has $Se_C(A)=0.98$ for *detecting* airway placement, meaning a negative result is a strong excluder. Our calculation confirms $P(A|C^{-})$ meets the safety goal.\n- \"pH improves the posterior for gastric versus esophageal...\" - Correct. The pH test has good discriminatory power between gastric and esophageal fluid.\n- \"radiography, being near-definitive, collapses residual error.\" - Correct. Radiography has a very high likelihood ratio for correct vs incorrect placement ($LR(+) = P(R^+|G)/P(R^+|\\neg G) = 0.995/0.001 = 995$), making it an excellent final confirmatory test.\n- \"placing the most safety-critical high-sensitivity test first and the highest-accuracy test last.\" - This is a sound risk management and decision-theoretic principle that this sequence follows perfectly.\n\n### 5. Analysis of Options C and D\n- **Option C (Radiography $\\rightarrow$ pH $\\rightarrow$ CO$_2$):** Incorrect. It violates the explicit constraint that radiography must be the final step. It also violates Policy Goal 1, as it requires patient transport for imaging *before* any test reduces the initial $2\\%$ risk of airway placement.\n- **Option D (CO$_2$ $\\rightarrow$ Radiography $\\rightarrow$ pH):** Incorrect. It violates the explicit constraint that radiography must be the final step.\n\n### Conclusion\nOption B is the only option that meets all conditions:\n1. It adheres to the sequencing constraint (\"radiography as the final step\").\n2. The workflow is clinically logical and prioritizes patient safety by first excluding the most dangerous misplacement.\n3. It satisfies both quantitative policy goals, as verified by rigorous Bayesian calculations.\n4. Its justification is factually correct and logically sound.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the ratio of volumetric flow rates in two nasogastric tubes of different radii, the calculation of this ratio, and an explanation of the clinical implications. The problem is based on the principles of fluid dynamics, specifically the Hagen-Poiseuille law.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe givens are:\n- The feeding formula is a Newtonian liquid.\n- The flow is laminar.\n- An infusion pump maintains a constant pressure difference, $\\Delta P$.\n- Two tubes are available, identical in length ($L$) and material.\n- Tube 1 has an internal radius $r_{1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- Tube 2 has an internal radius $r_{2} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- The analysis must start from the Hagen–Poiseuille law.\n- The pressure difference $\\Delta P$, dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, and tube length $L$ are unchanged.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using the established Hagen-Poiseuille law for laminar flow, which is a reasonable model for this scenario. The parameters provided are physically realistic for nasogastric tubes. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and all necessary information for the derivation and calculation is provided or can be logically inferred as constant. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Flow Rate Ratio\n\nThe Hagen–Poiseuille law describes the volumetric flow rate, $Q$, of a Newtonian fluid undergoing laminar flow through a rigid cylindrical tube of length $L$ and internal radius $r$. The equation is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\pi r^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\nwhere $\\Delta P$ is the pressure difference across the length of the tube and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.\n\nFor the first tube with radius $r_{1}$, the volumetric flow rate $Q_{1}$ is:\n$$Q_{1} = \\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nFor the second tube with radius $r_{2}$, the volumetric flow rate $Q_{2}$ is:\n$$Q_{2} = \\frac{\\pi r_{2}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}$$\n\nThe problem states that the pressure difference $\\Delta P$, the dynamic viscosity $\\eta$, and the tube length $L$ are the same for both scenarios. To find the ratio $Q_{2}/Q_{1}$, we divide the expression for $Q_{2}$ by the expression for $Q_{1}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi r_{2}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}{\\frac{\\pi r_{1}^4 \\Delta P}{8 \\eta L}}$$\n\nThe constant terms $\\pi$, $\\Delta P$, $8$, $\\eta$, and $L$ cancel out, leaving a simplified expression that depends only on the radii:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\frac{r_{2}^4}{r_{1}^4} = \\left(\\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\\right)^4$$\nThis is the derived expression for the ratio of the volumetric flow rates. This fourth-power relationship indicates that the flow rate is extremely sensitive to changes in the tube's radius.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe are given the radii $r_{1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $r_{2} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. We can now substitute these values into the derived expression. The units ($\\mathrm{mm}$) will cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity.\n\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\left(\\frac{1.6}{1.2}\\right)^4$$\n\nFirst, simplify the ratio of the radii:\n$$\\frac{1.6}{1.2} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\nNow, raise this ratio to the fourth power:\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{4^4}{3^4} = \\frac{256}{81}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division:\n$$\\frac{256}{81} \\approx 3.1604938...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final ratio to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{Q_{2}}{Q_{1}} \\approx 3.160$$\n\n### Step 4: Clinical Implications\n\nThe calculation shows that switching from the a $1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ radius tube to a $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ radius tube, while keeping the pressure difference constant, increases the volumetric flow rate by a factor of approximately $3.16$. The problem asks for the implications if the pump settings (which in this idealized model means constant $\\Delta P$) are not adjusted.\n\n1.  **Patient Tolerance**: An unadjusted, constant-pressure pump would deliver the enteral formula at a rate more than three times higher than the original setting. Such a rapid increase in infusion rate would overwhelm the patient's gastrointestinal absorptive and motor capacity. This is very likely to cause significant patient intolerance, manifesting as symptoms such as bloating, abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. For a post-operative patient, vomiting carries a high risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, which can lead to aspiration pneumonia, a serious and potentially fatal complication. Therefore, simply switching the tube without recalibrating the delivery rate is clinically dangerous. In practice, most modern enteral pumps are volumetric, meaning they maintain a constant flow rate ($Q$) rather than a constant pressure ($\\Delta P$). In that case, the pump would automatically reduce the pressure to maintain the set rate, as $\\Delta P \\propto 1/r^4$ for a fixed $Q$.\n\n2.  **Clog Risk**: The risk of tube occlusion, or clogging, is inversely related to the tube's radius. The Hagen-Poiseuille law demonstrates that resistance to flow is highly dependent on radius. The resistance $R$ can be defined as $R = \\Delta P / Q = 8 \\eta L / (\\pi r^4)$. The resistance in the smaller tube is $(4/3)^4 \\approx 3.16$ times greater than in the larger tube. A larger internal diameter ($2r$) provides more physical space, making it less likely for particulate matter in the formula to form an obstruction. Furthermore, if we consider a volumetric pump (constant $Q$), the pressure required to maintain that flow rate is much lower in the larger tube ($\\Delta P \\propto 1/r^4$). This lower driving pressure is less likely to compact particulates into a firm clog. Even in the constant-pressure model of this problem, the resulting higher flow velocity ($v = Q/A \\propto r^4/r^2 = r^2$) would help to keep particles suspended and flush them through the tube, thereby reducing the propensity for them to settle and cause a clog. Thus, using the larger tube ($r_2 = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) significantly reduces the risk of clogging.\n\nIn summary, while the larger tube reduces clog risk, the dramatic increase in flow rate under a constant-pressure system poses a significant threat to patient safety and tolerance. Any change in NGT size requires a corresponding adjustment of the infusion pump settings to ensure the prescribed volume is delivered over the intended time period.",

The feed is managed using a stepwise advancement protocol grounded in standard tolerance criteria. The protocol is as follows: begin at $20$ milliliters per hour at time $t=0$. Every $\\Delta t=6$ hours, assess tolerance. Tolerance requires all of: nausea severity $<4$ on a $0$–$10$ numeric rating scale during the preceding $6$ hours, no abdominal distension (operationalized as abdominal girth increase $\\geq 3$ centimeters or tympany), and a single gastric residual volume (GRV) measured at the end of the $6$-hour block $<500$ milliliters.

The volume is calculated as the rate of delivery multiplied by the duration.\n\nBlock $1$ ($t=0$ to $t=6$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $20$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_1 = 20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 120 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $2$ ($t=6$ to $t=12$ hours):\nThe rate is $30$ ml/hr for the first $2$ hours ($t=6$ to $t=8$). Feeds are stopped for the next $2$ hours ($t=8$ to $t=10$). The rate resumes at $30 - 10 = 20$ ml/hr for the final $2$ hours ($t=10$ to $t=12$).\n$$V_2 = \\left(30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(0 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) = 60 + 0 + 40 = 100 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $3$ ($t=12$ to $t=18$ hours):\nThe rate is $20$ ml/hr for the first $3$ hours ($t=12$ to $t=15$). Feeds are stopped for the next $2$ hours ($t=15$ to $t=17$). The rate resumes at $20 - 10 = 10$ ml/hr for the final $1$ hour ($t=17$ to $t=18$).\n$$V_3 = \\left(20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 3 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(0 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(10 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 1 \\text{ hr}\\right) = 60 + 0 + 10 = 70 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $4$ ($t=18$ to $t=24$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $10$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_4 = 10 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 60 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $5$ ($t=24$ to $t=30$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $20$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_5 = 20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 120 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $6$ ($t=30$ to $t=36$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $30$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_6 = 30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 180 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $7$ ($t=36$ to $t=42$ hours):\nThe rate is $40$ ml/hr for the first $2$ hours ($t=36$ to $t=38$). Feeds are stopped for the next $2$ hours ($t=38$ to $t=40$). The rate resumes at $40 - 10 = 30$ ml/hr for the final $2$ hours ($t=40$ to $t=42$).\n$$V_7 = \\left(40 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(0 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) = 80 + 0 + 60 = 140 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $8$ ($t=42$ to $t=48$ hours):\nDue to high GRV from the previous block, feeds are held for the first $2$ hours ($t=42$ to $t=44$). The rate then resumes at a reduced rate for the remaining $4$ hours. The prior block's terminal rate was $30$ ml/hr, so the new rate is $30 - 10 = 20$ ml/hr.\n$$V_8 = \\left(0 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 4 \\text{ hr}\\right) = 0 + 80 = 80 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $9$ ($t=48$ to $t=54$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $20$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_9 = 20 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 120 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $10$ ($t=54$ to $t=60$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $30$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_{10} = 30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 180 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $11$ ($t=60$ to $t=66$ hours):\nThe rate is $40$ ml/hr for the first $3$ hours ($t=60$ to $t=63$). Feeds are stopped for the next $2$ hours ($t=63$ to $t=65$). The rate resumes at $40 - 10 = 30$ ml/hr for the final $1$ hour ($t=65$ to $t=66$).\n$$V_{11} = \\left(40 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 3 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(0 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 2 \\text{ hr}\\right) + \\left(30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 1 \\text{ hr}\\right) = 120 + 0 + 30 = 150 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nBlock $12$ ($t=66$ to $t=72$ hours):\nThe rate is constant at $30$ ml/hr for the entire $6$-hour duration.\n$$V_{12} = 30 \\frac{\\text{ml}}{\\text{hr}} \\times 6 \\text{ hr} = 180 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nNow, we sum the volumes from all blocks:\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + V_4 + V_5 + V_6 + V_7 + V_8 + V_9 + V_{10} + V_{11} + V_{12}$$\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 120 + 100 + 70 + 60 + 120 + 180 + 140 + 80 + 120 + 180 + 150 + 180 \\text{ ml}$$\n$$V_{\\text{total}} = 1500 \\text{ ml}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the total energy delivered:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = V_{\\text{total}} \\times D_E = 1500 \\text{ ml} \\times 1.2 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{ml}}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 1800 \\text{ kcal}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1800$. To express this with four significant figures, it can be written as $1.800 \\times 10^3$. The number $1800$ itself is the correct representation.",
