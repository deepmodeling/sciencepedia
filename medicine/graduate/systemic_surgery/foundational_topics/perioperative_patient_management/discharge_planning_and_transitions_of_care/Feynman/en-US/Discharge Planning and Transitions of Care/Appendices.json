            "problem": "A 62-year-old man is being discharged on postoperative day $4$ after laparoscopic sigmoid resection for recurrent diverticulitis. He will require a home analgesic plan suitable for multimodal pain control that minimizes risk to hepatic and renal systems during the transition of care. He weighs $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ and is $172\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ tall. On the day of discharge, his labs show Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) $=115\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ with an upper limit of normal $40\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$, Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) $=98\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ with an upper limit of normal $41\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$, total bilirubin $=1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, serum albumin $=3.2\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$, serum creatinine $=1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ (baseline preoperative serum creatinine $=1.10\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$), and blood urea nitrogen $=24\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. His past medical history includes hypertension, type $2$ diabetes mellitus, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease without known cirrhosis. He takes losartan $50\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ daily. Vital signs and urine output are stable, there is no active bleeding, and gastrointestinal function has returned.\n\nYou are asked to select safe maximum daily doses for acetaminophen (paracetamol) and a representative Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug (NSAID), ibuprofen, for his discharge prescription. Base your decision on first principles of hepatic and renal physiology and on widely accepted, guideline-consistent dose limits and renal function thresholds. Proceed as follows:\n\n1. Estimate the patient’s glomerular filtration rate using the 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) race-free creatinine equation from serum creatinine and age, and classify the degree of renal impairment. Assume no race coefficient.\n2. Using core pharmacology principles for acetaminophen biotransformation and hepatotoxic risk, and conservative guideline-consistent limits in the presence of elevated AST and ALT without jaundice or overt synthetic failure, determine a safe maximum daily acetaminophen dose for discharge.\n3. Using renal prostaglandin physiology, the effect of NSAIDs on afferent arteriolar tone, and risk stratification by estimated glomerular filtration rate, justify whether ibuprofen should be included or excluded at discharge given his renal function, recent postoperative status, and concomitant renin–angiotensin system blockade. If excluded, report its maximum daily dose as $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$; if included, specify a safe maximum daily dose for discharge use.\n\nReport your final answer as a two-entry row vector $\\big[$acetaminophen maximum daily dose in $\\mathrm{mg/day}$, ibuprofen maximum daily dose in $\\mathrm{mg/day}\\big]$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of medicine, pharmacology, and physiology. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data for the required calculations and clinical reasoning, and it is expressed in objective, precise language. All conditions for proceeding with a solution are met.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Estimation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and Classification of Renal Impairment**\n\nThe patient is a $62$-year-old male with a serum creatinine (SCr) of $1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. The 2021 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) race-free creatinine equation is used to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). For a male with $\\text{SCr} > 0.9\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$, the equation is:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} = 142 \\times \\left( \\frac{\\text{SCr}}{0.9} \\right)^{-1.200} \\times 0.9938^{\\text{Age}} $$\nSubstituting the patient's data, where Age $= 62$ years and SCr $= 1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} = 142 \\times \\left( \\frac{1.50}{0.9} \\right)^{-1.200} \\times 0.9938^{62} $$\nThe ratio of creatinine values is:\n$$ \\frac{1.50}{0.9} \\approx 1.6667 $$\nCalculating the components of the equation:\n$$ (1.6667)^{-1.200} \\approx 0.5173 $$\n$$ 0.9938^{62} \\approx 0.6808 $$\nTherefore, the estimated GFR is:\n$$ \\text{eGFR} \\approx 142 \\times 0.5173 \\times 0.6808 \\approx 49.99\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2} $$\nAccording to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines, an eGFR between $45$ and $59\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2}$ corresponds to Stage 3a Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), indicating moderate renal impairment. Furthermore, the patient's serum creatinine has increased from a preoperative baseline of $1.10\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ to $1.50\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ postoperatively, an increase of $0.40\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This meets the criteria for Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), which is often defined as an increase in SCr by $\\ge 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$ within $48$ hours. The patient thus has an AKI superimposed on pre-existing moderate renal impairment.\n\n**Part 2: Determination of Maximum Daily Acetaminophen Dose**\n\nAcetaminophen is metabolized primarily in the liver via glucuronidation and sulfation. A minor fraction, typically $<10\\%$, is oxidized by cytochrome P$450$ enzymes (predominantly CYP2E1) to a highly reactive, toxic metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with glutathione. When glutathione stores are depleted, as can occur in an overdose or in states of malnutrition or chronic liver disease, NAPQI accumulates and causes centrilobular hepatic necrosis.\n\nThe patient presents with elevated liver transaminases (AST $= 115\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ or $\\approx 2.9$ times the upper limit of normal; ALT $= 98\\,\\mathrm{U/L}$ or $\\approx 2.4$ times the upper limit of normal) and a history of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These findings indicate active, albeit mild-to-moderate, hepatocellular injury. However, there is no evidence of severe hepatic synthetic dysfunction or cholestasis, as the total bilirubin is normal ($1.0\\,\\mathrm{mg/dL}$) and serum albumin is only mildly decreased ($3.2\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$).\n\nThe standard maximum daily dose for acetaminophen in healthy adults is $4000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. However, in patients with chronic liver disease or evidence of active liver injury, a more conservative approach is warranted to prevent further hepatic damage. Clinical guidelines and expert consensus recommend reducing the maximum daily dose to $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $3000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ in such patients. Given the active hepatocellular injury evident from the laboratory values and the underlying NAFLD, selecting a conservative maximum dose is prudent to minimize risk. Therefore, a maximum daily dose of $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ is the safest and most appropriate choice. This provides a substantial margin of safety against glutathione depletion while still offering effective analgesia as part of a multimodal regimen. This corresponds to $2.000 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$ when expressed to four significant figures.\n\n**Part 3: Determination of Maximum Daily Ibuprofen Dose**\n\nNon-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen exert their effect by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins. In the kidney, prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGI2) play a critical homeostatic role by inducing vasodilation of the afferent glomerular arteriole. This action is essential for maintaining renal blood flow and glomerular filtration pressure, particularly in states of renal hypoperfusion or reduced effective circulatory volume, such as the postoperative period.\n\nThe patient has several significant risk factors for NSAID-induced nephrotoxicity:\n1.  **Impaired Renal Function**: His eGFR is $\\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min/1.73m^2}$, and he has an active AKI. In this state, the kidney is highly dependent on prostaglandin-mediated afferent vasodilation to maintain GFR.\n2.  **Concomitant Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) Blockade**: The patient takes losartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Angiotensin II preferentially constricts the efferent arteriole to maintain glomerular filtration pressure in hypoperfused states. Blocking this effect with an ARB makes the GFR even more dependent on afferent arteriole tone.\n3.  **Postoperative Status**: The recent surgery is a state of physiological stress associated with fluid shifts and potential for volume depletion, which activates neurohumoral vasoconstrictor systems (e.g., RAAS, sympathetic nervous system) and increases reliance on local prostaglandin synthesis.\n\nAdministering an NSAID in this context would block the compensatory vasodilation of the afferent arteriole. In conjunction with the ARB's blockade of efferent arteriole constriction, this \"double hit\" would severely compromise the kidney's autoregulatory capacity, leading to a high probability of worsening his AKI. This combination of risk factors constitutes a strong contraindication to the use of NSAIDs.\n\nTherefore, ibuprofen must be excluded from his discharge analgesic plan to prevent further renal injury. The safe maximum daily dose is $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\n\n**Final Answer Summary**\n\nThe safe maximum daily dose for acetaminophen is $2000\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nThe safe maximum daily dose for ibuprofen is $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.\nThe final answer vector is $\\big[$acetaminophen dose, ibuprofen dose$\\big]$.\nThe acetaminophen dose, expressed to four significant figures as requested, is $2.000 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$. The ibuprofen dose, as an excluded agent, is exactly $0\\,\\mathrm{mg/day}$.",

This transforms it from a subjective question into a problem of applied science, which is to design a plan that adheres to given constraints. Such problems have meaningful, justifiable solutions, even if not strictly unique in all details. The problem requires sourcing standard half-life data, which is reasonable for the specified professorial role.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language. All quantities are specified numerically.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\n**Task 1: Calculation of Total Daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total daily dose in milligrams for each medication.\n\n1.  **Oxycodone:**\n    - The scheduled dose is $10$ mg every $6$ hours. The number of doses per day is $\\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{6 \\text{ hours/dose}} = 4$ doses.\n    - Daily scheduled dose: $D_{\\mathrm{oxy,sch}} = 10 \\text{ mg/dose} \\times 4 \\text{ doses/day} = 40 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n    - The average breakthrough dose is given as one $5$ mg dose per day: $D_{\\mathrm{oxy,prn}} = 5 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n    - Total daily oxycodone dose: $D_{\\mathrm{oxy,total}} = D_{\\mathrm{oxy,sch}} + D_{\\mathrm{oxy,prn}} = 40 \\text{ mg/day} + 5 \\text{ mg/day} = 45 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\n2.  **Hydromorphone:**\n    - The average use is $0.5$ doses per day of the $2$ mg PRN prescription.\n    - Total daily hydromorphone dose: $D_{\\mathrm{hydro,total}} = 2 \\text{ mg/dose} \\times 0.5 \\text{ doses/day} = 1 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\n3.  **Tramadol:**\n    - The scheduled dose is $50$ mg every $6$ hours. The number of doses per day is $\\frac{24 \\text{ hours}}{6 \\text{ hours/dose}} = 4$ doses.\n    - Total daily tramadol dose: $D_{\\mathrm{tram,total}} = 50 \\text{ mg/dose} \\times 4 \\text{ doses/day} = 200 \\text{ mg/day}$.\n\nNext, we convert each daily dose to its morphine milligram equivalent (MME) using the provided conversion factors ($k_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = 1.5$, $k_{\\mathrm{hydro}} = 4.0$, $k_{\\mathrm{tram}} = 0.10$).\n\n-   Oxycodone MME: $\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = D_{\\mathrm{oxy,total}} \\times k_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = 45 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 1.5 = 67.5 \\text{ mg MME/day}$.\n-   Hydromorphone MME: $\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{hydro}} = D_{\\mathrm{hydro,total}} \\times k_{\\mathrm{hydro}} = 1 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 4.0 = 4.0 \\text{ mg MME/day}$.\n-   Tramadol MME: $\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{tram}} = D_{\\mathrm{tram,total}} \\times k_{\\mathrm{tram}} = 200 \\text{ mg/day} \\times 0.10 = 20.0 \\text{ mg MME/day}$.\n\nFinally, we sum the MME contributions from each agent to find the total daily MME.\n\n$$\n\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{oxy}} + \\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{hydro}} + \\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{tram}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{total}} = 67.5 + 4.0 + 20.0 = 91.5 \\text{ mg MME/day}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{total}} = 91.50 \\text{ mg MME/day}\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Mathematically Explicit Taper Plan**\n\nA safe and effective opioid taper plan must be gradual and structured logically based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles.\n\n**Guiding Principles:**\n1.  **Sequence of Tapering:** The order in which opioids are tapered is critical. The general principle is to taper shorter-acting opioids before longer-acting ones. This allows for more rapid clearance and quicker assessment of the patient's withdrawal symptoms and pain control after a dose change. First, as-needed (PRN) medications are discontinued to establish a stable baseline of scheduled analgesia. We will use the following standard elimination half-lives ($t_{1/2}$) for justification:\n    - Hydromorphone (IR): $t_{1/2} \\approx 2-3$ hours (shortest).\n    - Oxycodone (IR): $t_{1/2} \\approx 3.2$ hours.\n    - Tramadol (IR): $t_{1/2} \\approx 6-7$ hours (longest). Tramadol's dual mechanism (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibition) also argues for it to be tapered last and slowly to avoid a separate discontinuation syndrome.\n    - Based on these principles, the tapering sequence shall be: 1. PRN hydromorphone, 2. PRN oxycodone, 3. scheduled oxycodone, and 4. scheduled tramadol.\n\n2.  **Practicality of Dose Reductions:** While the problem specifies a percentage reduction, clinical practice favors making changes that result in administrable doses and simplifying the regimen. Therefore, discontinuing entire doses (especially PRN) is preferable to creating small, fractional scheduled doses. The term \"approximately $0.10$\" allows for this clinical judgment.\n\n**Mathematical Model of the Taper:**\nLet $M(w)$ be the total daily MME at the beginning of week $w$, where $w=0$ is the start of the taper.\nThe initial MME is $M(0) = 91.50$ mg MME/day.\nThe taper plan is governed by the following recurrence relation for the target MME in the subsequent week:\n$$\nM_{\\text{target}}(w+1) = \\begin{cases} (1 - 0.10) \\cdot M(w) = 0.90 \\cdot M(w) & \\text{if } M(w) > 30 \\\\ (1 - 0.05) \\cdot M(w) = 0.95 \\cdot M(w) & \\text{if } M(w) \\le 30 \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe weekly MME reduction, $\\Delta M(w) = M(w) - M(w+1)$, is distributed across the agents according to the sequence justified above.\n\n**Proposed Taper Plan:**\n\n**Step 1: Week 1 - Elimination of PRN Doses**\n- The first step is to discontinue all as-needed medications to simplify the regimen and eliminate the component used for breakthrough pain.\n- Discontinue Hydromorphone IR $2$ mg PRN. This removes an MME of $4.0$.\n- Discontinue Oxycodone IR $5$ mg PRN. This removes an MME of $5 \\text{ mg} \\times 1.5 = 7.5$.\n- Total MME reduction: $\\Delta M(0) = 4.0 + 7.5 = 11.5$ mg MME.\n- This reduction is $\\frac{11.5}{91.50} \\approx 0.126$, or $12.6\\%$ of the initial MME, which is consistent with the \"approximately $0.10$\" directive and clinically sound.\n- New state at start of Week 2 ($w=1$):\n    - Regimen: Oxycodone IR $10$ mg q$6$h ($40$ mg/day) and Tramadol $50$ mg q$6$h ($200$ mg/day).\n    - New Total MME: $M(1) = 91.50 - 11.5 = 80.0$ mg MME/day.\n        - $\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{oxy}} = 60.0$\n        - $\\text{MME}_{\\mathrm{tram}} = 20.0$\n\n**Step 2: Weeks $w \\ge 1$ - Taper of Scheduled Oxycodone (while $M(w) > 30$)**\n- The weekly MME reduction of $\\Delta M(w) = 0.10 \\cdot M(w)$ will be taken from the oxycodone component, as it has the shorter half-life.\n- Let $M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w)$ and $M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w)$ be the MME from each drug at the start of week $w$.\n- The recurrence relations for this phase are:\n    $$M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w+1) = M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w) - \\Delta M(w) = M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w) - 0.10 \\cdot (M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w) + M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w))$$\n    $$M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w+1) = M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w) = 20.0$$\n- This continues until either $M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$ is eliminated or the total MME, $M(w)$, falls to or below $30$ mg MME/day. The resulting MME for oxycodone should be converted back to a practical daily dose (mg/day) and adjusted in the patient's regimen (e.g., by reducing the dose of one or more of the scheduled administrations).\n\n**Step 3: Transition to Slower Taper or Tramadol Taper**\n- **Scenario A: Total MME drops to $\\le 30$ while Oxycodone remains.**\n    - If at any week $w$, $M(w) \\le 30$, the reduction rate changes to $5\\%$.\n    - The reduction $\\Delta M(w) = 0.05 \\cdot M(w)$ continues to be taken from the oxycodone dose first until it is eliminated.\n    $$\\text{if } M(w) \\le 30: \\quad M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w+1) = M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w) - 0.05 \\cdot M(w)$$\n- **Scenario B: Oxycodone is eliminated while Total MME is $> 30$.**\n    - If the oxycodone taper reduces $M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}$ to $0$ and the remaining MME (from tramadol alone) is still greater than $30$, the taper would proceed by reducing tramadol MME by $10\\%$ per week. This is unlikely given the starting values.\n    - If $M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}(w+1) \\le 0$, then set $M_{\\mathrm{oxy}}=0$ and apply the remaining required reduction to tramadol.\n\n**Step 4: Final Taper of Tramadol**\n- Once oxycodone is fully discontinued, the remaining MME is entirely from tramadol. The taper continues by reducing the tramadol dose.\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w+1) = \\begin{cases} 0.90 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w) & \\text{if } M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w) > 30 \\\\ 0.95 \\cdot M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w) & \\text{if } M_{\\mathrm{tram}}(w) \\le 30 \\end{cases}\n$$\n- This process continues until tramadol is discontinued or a clinically stable, low-dose endpoint is reached. This plan provides a clear, mathematically defined, and pharmacologically justified framework for the patient's opioid taper.",

The output must adhere to strict formatting rules, including the mandatory use of LaTeX for all mathematical entities.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Patient weight: $70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n-   Clinical state: Postoperative day $5$, open colorectal surgery, sepsis, catabolic, hemodynamically stable, normal renal function.\n-   Daily energy target: $30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}$\n-   Daily protein target: $1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}$\n-   Oral meals: $3$ small meals per day.\n-   Served content per meal: $600\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of protein.\n-   Expected consumption rate: $60\\%$ of each meal.\n-   Oral Nutrition Supplement (ONS): $1$ bottle ($237\\,\\mathrm{mL}$) provides $350\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$ and $20\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of protein.\n-   ONS limit: At most $2$ bottles per day.\n-   Modular whey protein powder: $1$ scoop provides $15\\,\\mathrm{g}$ of protein and $60\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$.\n-   Protein powder limit: At most $2$ scoops per day.\n-   Nocturnal enteral formula: Provides $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mL}$ and $50\\,\\mathrm{g/L}$ of protein.\n-   Nocturnal infusion window: $10\\,\\mathrm{h}$.\n-   Maximum pump rate: $120\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set in the context of clinical nutrition for a surgical patient, a well-established medical and scientific field. The patient's condition (catabolic stress secondary to surgery and sepsis) correctly justifies the need for aggressive nutritional support. The specified energy and protein targets ($30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}$ and $1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}$) are consistent with contemporary clinical guidelines (e.g., from the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, ASPEN) for such patients. The nutritional products and feeding modalities described are standard clinical tools. The problem is factually and scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-defined. It provides clear quantitative targets for energy and protein, a set of nutritional sources with defined compositions, and explicit constraints on their use. The objective is to calculate a minimal infusion rate, which requires minimizing the nocturnal feed volume. This is achieved by maximizing daytime intake, a clear optimization strategy. The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary data to arrive at a unique numerical solution.\n-   **Objective:** The language is clinical, precise, and devoid of subjective or opinion-based statements. All parameters are quantitative.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities. It presents a realistic clinical scenario that can be solved with arithmetic and logical optimization. Therefore, a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nFirst, as requested, we justify the provided nutritional targets. The patient is in a catabolic state due to major surgery and sepsis. This triggers a systemic inflammatory response, leading to hypermetabolism and hypercatabolism. Energy expenditure increases, and there is significant breakdown of endogenous protein, primarily from skeletal muscle, to supply amino acids for gluconeogenesis, synthesis of acute-phase proteins, and immune cell proliferation. Without adequate nutritional support, this leads to malnutrition, muscle wasting, impaired wound healing, and compromised immune function. The energy target of $30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}$ is appropriate to meet the increased metabolic demands. The protein target of $1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}$ is necessary to counteract the high rate of protein breakdown, promote a positive nitrogen balance, and support vital synthetic functions. The patient's normal renal function confirms their ability to tolerate this high protein load.\n\nNext, we proceed with the calculations.\n\n**1. Calculate Total Daily Nutritional Targets**\nLet $m$ be the patient's mass. The problem gives $m = 70\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nThe total daily energy target, $E_{target}$, is:\n$$E_{target} = (30\\,\\mathrm{kcal/kg/day}) \\times m = 30 \\times 70 = 2100\\,\\mathrm{kcal/day}$$\nThe total daily protein target, $P_{target}$, is:\n$$P_{target} = (1.8\\,\\mathrm{g/kg/day}) \\times m = 1.8 \\times 70 = 126\\,\\mathrm{g/day}$$\n\n**2. Design the Optimal Daytime Plan by Maximizing Intake**\nTo minimize the nocturnal tube feed, the daytime intake from all available oral sources must be maximized within the given constraints.\n\n-   **Intake from Meals:**\n    The patient consumes $60\\%$ of $3$ meals.\n    Energy from meals, $E_{meals} = 3 \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{kcal}) \\times 0.60 = 1080\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$.\n    Protein from meals, $P_{meals} = 3 \\times (25\\,\\mathrm{g}) \\times 0.60 = 45\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\n-   **Intake from Oral Nutrition Supplements (ONS):**\n    The patient tolerates a maximum of $2$ bottles per day.\n    Energy from ONS, $E_{ONS} = 2 \\times (350\\,\\mathrm{kcal}) = 700\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$.\n    Protein from ONS, $P_{ONS} = 2 \\times (20\\,\\mathrm{g}) = 40\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\n-   **Intake from Modular Protein Powder:**\n    The patient can incorporate a maximum of $2$ scoops per day.\n    Energy from powder, $E_{powder} = 2 \\times (60\\,\\mathrm{kcal}) = 120\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$.\n    Protein from powder, $P_{powder} = 2 \\times (15\\,\\mathrm{g}) = 30\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\n-   **Total Daytime Intake:**\n    Total energy from daytime intake is the sum of all sources:\n    $$E_{day} = E_{meals} + E_{ONS} + E_{powder} = 1080 + 700 + 120 = 1900\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\n    Total protein from daytime intake is:\n    $$P_{day} = P_{meals} + P_{ONS} + P_{powder} = 45 + 40 + 30 = 115\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\n**3. Calculate the Nutritional Deficit**\nThe deficit is the difference between the total daily target and the total daytime intake. This amount must be supplied by the nocturnal enteral feeding.\n\n-   **Energy Deficit:**\n    $$E_{deficit} = E_{target} - E_{day} = 2100 - 1900 = 200\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$$\n-   **Protein Deficit:**\n    $$P_{deficit} = P_{target} - P_{day} = 126 - 115 = 11\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\n\n**4. Determine the Minimum Volume of Nocturnal Enteral Feed**\nLet $V$ be the total volume of enteral formula in $\\mathrm{mL}$ required to meet the deficits. The formula's nutritional content is:\n-   Energy density, $\\rho_E = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mL}$.\n-   Protein density, $\\rho_P = 50\\,\\mathrm{g/L} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1000\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{g/mL}$.\n\nTo meet the energy deficit, the volume $V$ must satisfy:\n$$V \\times \\rho_E \\ge E_{deficit} \\implies V \\times 1.2 \\ge 200 \\implies V \\ge \\frac{200}{1.2} \\implies V \\ge 166.\\overline{6}\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nTo meet the protein deficit, the volume $V$ must satisfy:\n$$V \\times \\rho_P \\ge P_{deficit} \\implies V \\times 0.05 \\ge 11 \\implies V \\ge \\frac{11}{0.05} \\implies V \\ge 220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nTo satisfy both nutritional requirements, the volume $V$ must be greater than or equal to both minimums. Therefore, we must choose the larger of the two values.\n$$V_{min} = \\max(166.\\overline{6}, 220) = 220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\nThus, a minimum volume of $220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ is required. At this volume, the protein target is met exactly, while the energy target is exceeded ($220\\,\\mathrm{mL} \\times 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kcal/mL} = 264\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$, which is greater than the $200\\,\\mathrm{kcal}$ deficit). This is acceptable, as the goal is to meet or exceed targets.\n\n**5. Calculate the Minimal Constant Infusion Rate**\nThe minimal volume, $V_{min} = 220\\,\\mathrm{mL}$, is to be infused over the nightly window of $T = 10\\,\\text{h}$. The constant infusion rate, $R$, is:\n$$R = \\frac{V_{min}}{T} = \\frac{220\\,\\mathrm{mL}}{10\\,\\text{h}} = 22\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$$\n\nThis calculated rate of $22\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$ is well below the maximum safe pump rate of $120\\,\\mathrm{mL/h}$, so it is a feasible rate.\n\nThe question asks for the numeric answer rounded to three significant figures. The value $22$ has two significant figures. To express it with three, we write it as $22.0$.",
