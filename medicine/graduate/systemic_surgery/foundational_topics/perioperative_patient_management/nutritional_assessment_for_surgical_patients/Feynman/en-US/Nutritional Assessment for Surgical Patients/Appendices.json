This practice demonstrates the application of the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST), a widely used method for identifying patients at risk of malnutrition.

            "problem": "A $55$-year-old elective colorectal surgical patient presents for pre-admission surgery evaluation. Historical data document a preoperative baseline body weight of $80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ measured $3$ months ago, and a current body weight of $72\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ measured today. Height is $1.78\\ \\mathrm{m}$. The patient resumed oral intake within $24\\ \\mathrm{h}$ of a recent diagnostic endoscopy and is not expected to have $>\\!5$ days without nutritional intake around the planned operation.

Report your final answer as a two-entry row matrix $\\left(\\text{fractional weight loss as a decimal},\\ \\text{numeric MUST score}\\right)$, with no units attached to either entry in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of two quantities for a preoperative surgical patient: the fractional weight loss and the overall numeric Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) score.\n\nFirst, we determine the fractional weight loss. The problem states this is to be calculated over a $3$-month interval.\nLet the preoperative baseline body weight be $W_0$ and the current body weight be $W_f$.\nThe given values are:\n$W_0 = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n$W_f = 72\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe weight loss, denoted as $\\Delta W$, is the difference between the initial and final weights:\n$$ \\Delta W = W_0 - W_f = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg} - 72\\ \\mathrm{kg} = 8\\ \\mathrm{kg} $$\nThe fractional weight loss is the ratio of the weight loss to the initial weight. This corresponds to the request for the \"fractional weight loss as a decimal\".\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{W_0} = \\frac{W_0 - W_f}{W_0} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss} = \\frac{8\\ \\mathrm{kg}}{80\\ \\mathrm{kg}} = 0.1 $$\nThe problem requires this decimal to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is $1$. To have four significant figures, we must add three zeros after it.\n$$ \\text{Fractional Weight Loss (rounded)} = 0.1000 $$\n\nNext, we determine the overall numeric MUST score. The MUST score is the sum of scores from three distinct steps.\n\nStep 1: Body Mass Index (BMI) Score\nThe BMI is calculated using the patient's current weight $W_f$ and height $H$.\nGiven: $W_f = 72\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and $H = 1.78\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\nThe formula for BMI is:\n$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{W_f}{H^2} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\text{BMI} = \\frac{72}{(1.78)^2} = \\frac{72}{3.1684} \\approx 22.723\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2} $$\nThe MUST score for BMI ($S_{\\text{BMI}}$) is assigned based on the following standard categories:\n- Score $0$ for BMI $> 20.0\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\n- Score $1$ for BMI in the range $18.5 - 20.0\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\n- Score $2$ for BMI $< 18.5\\ \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$\nSince the calculated BMI of approximately $22.72$ is greater than $20.0$, the score for this step is:\n$$ S_{\\text{BMI}} = 0 $$\n\nStep 2: Unplanned Weight Loss Score\nThis score is based on the percentage of unplanned weight loss over the preceding $3-6$ months. The percentage weight loss is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Percentage Weight Loss} = \\frac{\\Delta W}{W_0} \\times 100\\% $$\nUsing the previously calculated fractional loss:\n$$ \\text{Percentage Weight Loss} = 0.1 \\times 100\\% = 10\\% $$\nThe time frame is given as $3$ months, which falls within the $3-6$ month window. The MUST score for weight loss ($S_{\\text{WL}}$) is assigned as follows:\n- Score $0$ for weight loss $< 5\\%$\n- Score $1$ for weight loss of $5-10\\%$\n- Score $2$ for weight loss $> 10\\%$\nThe calculated weight loss is exactly $10\\%$. The category \"$5-10\\%$\" is inclusive of its endpoints. Therefore, the score for this step is:\n$$ S_{\\text{WL}} = 1 $$\n\nStep 3: Acute Disease Effect Score\nA score of $2$ is added if the patient is acutely ill and there has been, or is likely to be, no nutritional intake for more than $5$ days. The problem states that the patient is undergoing an elective procedure and \"is not expected to have $>\\!5$ days without nutritional intake around the planned operation\". This indicates the patient is not acutely ill in the context of the MUST tool, and the nutritional intake condition for a score of $2$ is not met. Thus, the acute disease effect score ($S_{\\text{ADE}}$) is:\n$$ S_{\\text{ADE}} = 0 $$\n\nFinally, the overall numeric MUST score ($S_{\\text{MUST}}$) is the sum of the scores from the three steps:\n$$ S_{\\text{MUST}} = S_{\\text{BMI}} + S_{\\text{WL}} + S_{\\text{ADE}} $$\nSubstituting the scores:\n$$ S_{\\text{MUST}} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1 $$\n\nThe two required values are the fractional weight loss expressed as a decimal to four significant figures ($0.1000$) and the numeric MUST score ($1$). These are to be reported in a two-entry row matrix.",

In the immediate postoperative period, the patient is expected to be on bed rest, so any activity factor can be neglected.

            "solution": "The objective is to calculate two quantities: the increase in daily energy expenditure due to surgical stress and the additional daily protein required to meet the surgical target.\n\nFirst, we calculate the expected increase in daily energy expenditure, denoted as $\\Delta E$. The Total Energy Expenditure ($TEE$) for a patient is estimated by multiplying the Resting Energy Expenditure ($REE$) by an activity factor and a physiological stress factor ($S_f$). The problem specifies a measured $REE$ of $1{,}600\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d}$. It also states that the patient is on bed rest, so any activity factor can be neglected, which is equivalent to setting the activity factor to $1$. The physiological stress factor for major open abdominal surgery is given as $S_f = 1.3$.\n\nThe estimated $TEE$ during the postoperative period is:\n$$ TEE_{stress} = REE \\times S_f $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ TEE_{stress} = 1{,}600\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d} \\times 1.3 = 2{,}080\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d} $$\nThe increase in daily energy expenditure, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between this stressed energy expenditure and the baseline resting energy expenditure:\n$$ \\Delta E = TEE_{stress} - REE $$\nThis can also be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta E = (REE \\times S_f) - REE = REE \\times (S_f - 1) $$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$ \\Delta E = 1{,}600\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d} \\times (1.3 - 1) = 1{,}600\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d} \\times 0.3 = 480\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d} $$\nThe problem requires this quantity to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $480$ has exactly three significant figures ($4$, $8$, and the trailing $0$). Thus, the increase in energy expenditure is $480\\ \\mathrm{kcal/d}$.\n\nSecond, we calculate the additional daily protein needed, denoted as $\\Delta P$. The calculation is based on the patient's body weight and the specified protein requirements per kilogram of body weight.

The total target protein requirement is:\n$$ P_{target} = W \\times R_{target} = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 1.5\\ \\mathrm{g/kg/d} = 105\\ \\mathrm{g/d} $$\nThe additional daily protein needed, $\\Delta P$, is the difference between the target requirement and the baseline requirement:\n$$ \\Delta P = P_{target} - P_{base} $$\nThis can be calculated directly from the rates:\n$$ \\Delta P = W \\times (R_{target} - R_{base}) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\Delta P = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times (1.5\\ \\mathrm{g/kg/d} - 0.8\\ \\mathrm{g/kg/d}) = 70\\ \\mathrm{kg} \\times 0.7\\ \\mathrm{g/kg/d} = 49\\ \\mathrm{g/d} $$\nThe problem requires this quantity to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is $49$. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero after the decimal point, resulting in $49.0$. Thus, the additional daily protein needed is $49.0\\ \\mathrm{g/d}$.\n\nThe final answer is to be reported as a row matrix containing the energy increase in $\\mathrm{kcal/d}$ and the additional protein in $\\mathrm{g/d}$.

            "solution": "First, the total daily mass of protein (amino acids) is calculated based on the patient's weight and protein requirement.\nLet $M_P$ be the mass of protein in grams.\n$$M_P = (1.5 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{day}}) \\times (70 \\text{ kg}) = 105 \\text{ g/day}$$\n\nNext, the energy provided by this mass of protein, $E_P$, is calculated.\n$$E_P = (105 \\text{ g}) \\times (4 \\frac{\\text{kcal}}{\\text{g}}) = 420 \\text{ kcal}$$\n\nThe remaining energy must be supplied by non-protein sources (dextrose and lipids).
