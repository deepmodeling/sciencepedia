            "problem": "A sedated patient undergoing systemic surgery is positioned for induction. To reduce aspiration risk, the operating table is adjusted from supine to a head-up tilt of $30^{\\circ}$ (degrees). Model the intragastric contents as a static, incompressible Newtonian fluid of uniform density. Let the stomach lumen communicate hydrostatically with the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) at the level of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Assume there is no fluid motion and neglect surface tension and airway pressure effects. In the supine position, the vertical separation between the intragastric free surface and the GEJ can be approximated as negligible. In the $30^{\\circ}$ head-up position, imaging demonstrates a vertical height difference of $h = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$ between the intragastric free surface and the GEJ, with the GEJ located above the free surface. The density of gastric fluid is $ \\rho = 1000\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, and gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n\nStarting from the static limit of the momentum balance for a fluid at rest and the definition of hydrostatic equilibrium, derive the hydrostatic pressure distribution and compute the change in hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ between the supine and the $30^{\\circ}$ head-up positions. Express the final result as the magnitude of the reduction in hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ due to head-up tilt. Use pascals for your final unit and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in hydrostatic pressure at the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) when a patient is moved from a supine to a $30^{\\circ}$ head-up tilt position. The solution is derived from the fundamental principles of fluid statics.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equation for hydrostatic pressure. For a fluid at rest (static), the velocity is zero everywhere. The momentum balance equation for a Newtonian fluid (a form of the Navier-Stokes equation) simplifies to the Euler equation for hydrostatics when the velocity and its derivatives are set to zero. This leaves a balance between the pressure gradient force and the gravitational body force:\n$$ -\\nabla P + \\rho \\mathbf{f_b} = 0 $$\nwhere $P$ is the scalar pressure field, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, and $\\mathbf{f_b}$ is the body force per unit mass. In this case, the only body force is gravity, so $\\mathbf{f_b} = \\mathbf{g}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\nabla P = \\rho \\mathbf{g} $$\nLet's define a Cartesian coordinate system where the z-axis points vertically upward, such that the gravitational acceleration vector is $\\mathbf{g} = (0, 0, -g)$, where $g$ is the magnitude of gravitational acceleration. In component form, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial y} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g $$\nThese expressions show that the pressure $P$ is constant on any horizontal plane (constant $z$) and varies only with the vertical coordinate $z$. To find the pressure distribution, we integrate the third equation with respect to $z$. Assuming the fluid is incompressible ($\\rho$ is constant) and the gravitational field is uniform ($g$ is constant), integrating from a reference vertical position $z_0$ with pressure $P_0$ to an arbitrary position $z$ with pressure $P(z)$ yields:\n$$ \\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} dP' = -\\int_{z_0}^{z} \\rho g dz' $$\n$$ P(z) - P_0 = -\\rho g (z - z_0) $$\nThis is the fundamental equation for hydrostatic pressure distribution. Let's set our reference point at the free surface of the intragastric fluid. We denote the vertical position of this surface as $z_{surf}$ and the pressure at this surface as $P_{surf}$. Then for any point at a vertical position $z_{GEJ}$ corresponding to the gastroesophageal junction, the pressure $P_{GEJ}$ is:\n$$ P_{GEJ} - P_{surf} = -\\rho g (z_{GEJ} - z_{surf}) $$\nLet $h_{vert} = z_{GEJ} - z_{surf}$ be the vertical separation between the GEJ and the free surface. A positive $h_{vert}$ means the GEJ is located vertically above the free surface. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ P_{GEJ} = P_{surf} - \\rho g h_{vert} $$\n\nNow, we apply this result to the two specified patient positions.\n\nCase 1: Supine Position\nIn the supine position, the problem states that \"the vertical separation between the intragastric free surface and the GEJ can be approximated as negligible.\" This corresponds to:\n$$ h_{vert, supine} = 0\\,\\text{m} $$\nTherefore, the hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ in the supine position, $P_{GEJ, supine}$, is:\n$$ P_{GEJ, supine} = P_{surf} - \\rho g (0) = P_{surf} $$\n\nCase 2: $30^{\\circ}$ Head-Up Tilt Position\nIn the head-up tilt position, the problem provides a new vertical separation: \"a vertical height difference of $h = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$ between the intragastric free surface and the GEJ, with the GEJ located above the free surface.\" This gives:\n$$ h_{vert, tilt} = h = 0.10\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe tilt angle of $30^{\\circ}$ is information that leads to this vertical separation but is not directly needed for the calculation since the vertical height $h$ is explicitly given. The pressure at the GEJ in this position, $P_{GEJ, tilt}$, is:\n$$ P_{GEJ, tilt} = P_{surf} - \\rho g h $$\n\nChange in Hydrostatic Pressure\nThe change in hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ, $\\Delta P_{GEJ}$, is the difference between the pressure in the tilted position and the pressure in the supine position:\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = P_{GEJ, tilt} - P_{GEJ, supine} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = (P_{surf} - \\rho g h) - P_{surf} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{GEJ} = - \\rho g h $$\nThe negative sign indicates that the pressure at the GEJ decreases when the patient is moved to the head-up position. The problem asks for the magnitude of the reduction in hydrostatic pressure, which is $|\\Delta P_{GEJ}|$.\n$$ |\\Delta P_{GEJ}| = \\rho g h $$\n\nNumerical Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n- Density of gastric fluid, $\\rho = 1000\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n- Gravitational acceleration, $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$\n- Vertical height difference, $h = 0.10\\,\\text{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the magnitude of the pressure reduction:\n$$ |\\Delta P_{GEJ}| = (1000\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}) \\times (0.10\\,\\text{m}) $$\n$$ |\\Delta P_{GEJ}| = 981\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-2} $$\nThe unit $\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$ is equivalent to the Pascal ($Pa$), which is the SI unit of pressure. The calculated value is $981\\,\\text{Pa}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures, which $981$ already is.\n\nThus, the magnitude of the reduction in hydrostatic pressure at the GEJ is $981\\,\\text{Pa}$. This pressure reduction is a key factor in mitigating the risk of passive regurgitation and subsequent aspiration during surgery.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It represents a standard application of Bayesian inference in the context of medical diagnostics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $A$ be the event of clinically significant aspiration.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive gastric ultrasound test, indicating high gastric volume.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n1.  The prior probability of aspiration: $P(A) = 0.02$.\n2.  The positive likelihood ratio for the ultrasound test:\n    $$ \\text{LR}_{+} = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid A)}{P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A)} = 5 $$\n    where $\\neg A$ is the event of no aspiration.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of aspiration given a positive test result, which is denoted by $P(A \\mid T^{+})$.\n\nWe begin with Bayes' theorem, as required:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^{+})} $$\n\nThe denominator, $P(T^{+})$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be expanded using the law of total probability with respect to the mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $A$ and $\\neg A$:\n$$ P(T^{+}) = P(T^{+} \\mid A) P(A) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A) P(\\neg A) $$\n\nSubstituting this expansion into Bayes' theorem gives:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid A) P(A)}{P(T^{+} \\mid A) P(A) + P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A) P(\\neg A)} $$\n\nWe have the prior probability $P(A) = 0.02$.

We are given the ratio of these probabilities, $\\text{LR}_{+} = 5$. To make the expression solvable with the given information, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A)$:\n$$ P(A \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid A)}{P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A)} P(A)}{\\frac{P(T^{+} \\mid A)}{P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A)} P(A) + P(\\neg A)} $$\nThis is valid as long as $P(T^{+} \\mid \\neg A)  0$.
