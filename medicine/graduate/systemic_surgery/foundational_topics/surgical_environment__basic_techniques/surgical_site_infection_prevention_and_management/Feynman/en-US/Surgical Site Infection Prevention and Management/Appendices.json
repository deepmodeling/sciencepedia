This exercise focuses on translating population-level data, such as a relative risk reported in a meta-analysis, into tangible metrics that are meaningful for an individual patient. By calculating the absolute risk increase and the number needed to harm for a common risk factor like smoking, you will develop a core skill for patient counseling and personalized risk assessment .",

            "problem": "A tertiary surgical center is monitoring surgical site infection risk under a standardized prophylaxis bundle. Among non-smoking patients matched for American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class and procedure complexity, the baseline risk of developing a postoperative surgical site infection is $5\\%$. A propensity score–adjusted meta-analysis of active cigarette smoking reports a relative risk of $1.8$ for surgical site infection when comparing current smokers to matched non-smokers under similar prophylaxis and perioperative care. Assume the causal effect of active smoking on surgical site infection is well approximated by a multiplicative model on risk (so that relative risk applies to absolute risk at this baseline) and that there is no competing risk distortion within the relevant postoperative window.\n\nStarting only from epidemiological core definitions (relative risk as a ratio of risks, absolute risk increase as a risk difference between exposed and unexposed, and number needed to harm as the reciprocal of the absolute risk increase), derive the absolute risk increase attributable to active smoking and the corresponding number needed to harm for surgical site infection relative to non-smoking at this baseline.\n\nProvide exact values with no rounding. Express the absolute risk increase as a decimal proportion (not with a percent sign), and report the number needed to harm as an integer. Give your final answer as two values in the order: absolute risk increase, number needed to harm.",
            "solution": "The goal is to compute, for surgical site infection under the specified conditions, the absolute risk increase due to active smoking and the corresponding number needed to harm, using only core epidemiological definitions.\n\nLet the baseline (unexposed) risk of surgical site infection be denoted by $p_{0}$. The problem states $p_{0} = 5\\%$, which as a proportion is $p_{0} = 0.05$. Let the exposed group be active smokers, with risk $p_{1}$. The relative risk (ratio of risks) is defined as\n$$\n\\text{RR} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}.\n$$\nThe problem gives $\\text{RR} = 1.8$. Under the multiplicative risk model, we solve for $p_{1}$:\n$$\np_{1} = \\text{RR} \\times p_{0} = 1.8 \\times 0.05 = 0.09.\n$$\n\nThe absolute risk increase (risk difference) is defined as\n$$\n\\text{ARI} = p_{1} - p_{0}.\n$$\nSubstituting $p_{1} = 0.09$ and $p_{0} = 0.05$,\n$$\n\\text{ARI} = 0.09 - 0.05 = 0.04.\n$$\nThis is already expressed as a decimal proportion.\n\nThe number needed to harm is defined as the reciprocal of the absolute risk increase:\n$$\n\\text{NNH} = \\frac{1}{\\text{ARI}} = \\frac{1}{0.04} = 25.\n$$\n\nThus, the absolute risk increase attributable to active smoking at this baseline is $0.04$, and the number needed to harm is $25$.

            "problem": "A multicenter randomized controlled trial in systemic surgery evaluated two preoperative skin antisepsis strategies for preventing Surgical Site Infection (SSI). A total of $400$ adult patients undergoing clean-contaminated elective procedures were randomized in a $1:1$ ratio to either chlorhexidine–alcohol or povidone–iodine–alcohol. Within $30$ days postoperatively, the cumulative incidence of SSI was observed to be $3\\%$ in the chlorhexidine–alcohol group and $5.5\\%$ in the povidone–iodine–alcohol group, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Using only fundamental definitions for risk, relative risk, absolute risk reduction, and Number Needed to Treat (NNT), derive, from first principles, expressions for the risk ratio of SSI comparing chlorhexidine–alcohol to povidone–iodine–alcohol, the absolute risk reduction attributable to chlorhexidine–alcohol, and the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) to prevent one SSI. Then compute their numerical values from these expressions. Finally, interpret the clinical significance of these effect measures in the context of SSI prevention in systemic surgery. Express the risk ratio and the absolute risk reduction as decimals rounded to four significant figures, without using a percentage sign.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and definitions are provided to derive the requested statistical measures from first principles.\n\nThe total number of patients in the trial is $N_{total} = 400$. They are randomized in a $1:1$ ratio into two groups.\nLet the chlorhexidine–alcohol group be the intervention group, denoted by the subscript $CHG$.\nLet the povidone–iodine–alcohol group be the control group, denoted by the subscript $PVP$.\nThe number of patients in each group is:\n$$N_{CHG} = N_{PVP} = \\frac{1}{1+1} \\times 400 = 200$$\n\nThe problem provides the cumulative incidence of Surgical Site Infection (SSI) within $30$ days, which corresponds to the risk ($R$) of the event in each group.\nThe risk of SSI in the intervention group is $R_{CHG} = 3\\% = 0.03$.\nThe risk of SSI in the control group is $R_{PVP} = 5.5\\% = 0.055$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the Risk Ratio ($RR$) and compute its value.\nThe Risk Ratio, also known as Relative Risk, is defined from first principles as the ratio of the risk of an event in the intervention group to the risk of the event in the control group.\n$$RR = \\frac{\\text{Risk in intervention group}}{\\text{Risk in control group}} = \\frac{R_{CHG}}{R_{PVP}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the risks:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.03}{0.055} = \\frac{30}{55} = \\frac{6}{11}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$RR \\approx 0.545454... \\approx 0.5455$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) and compute its value.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction is defined from first principles as the absolute difference in risk between the control group and the intervention group. It quantifies the decrease in risk associated with the intervention.\n$$ARR = \\text{Risk in control group} - \\text{Risk in intervention group} = R_{PVP} - R_{CHG}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ARR = 0.055 - 0.03 = 0.025$$\nTo express this as a decimal with four significant figures, we write:\n$$ARR = 0.02500$$\n\nThird, we derive the expression for the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) and compute its value.\nThe Number Needed to Treat is defined from first principles as the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT_{raw} = \\frac{1}{ARR} = \\frac{1}{R_{PVP} - R_{CHG}}$$\nThe problem specifies computing the $NNT$ as the ceiling of this value, which is standard practice because the number of patients must be an integer. The ceiling function $\\lceil x \\rceil$ gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to $x$.\n$$NNT = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{ARR} \\right\\rceil$$\nSubstituting the value of $ARR$:\n$$NNT = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{0.025} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 40 \\rceil$$\nSince $40$ is an integer, the ceiling of $40$ is $40$.\n$$NNT = 40$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the clinical significance of these measures.\nThe Risk Ratio ($RR$) of $0.5455$ signifies that patients receiving chlorhexidine–alcohol antisepsis have a risk of SSI that is $54.55\\%$ of the risk of those receiving povidone–iodine–alcohol. This corresponds to a relative risk reduction of $1 - 0.5455 = 0.4545$, or $45.45\\%$. This indicates a substantial protective effect of the chlorhexidine–alcohol preparation relative to the control.\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) of $0.02500$ indicates that for every $100$ patients treated with chlorhexidine–alcohol instead of povidone–iodine–alcohol, $2.5$ SSIs are prevented. This provides a direct, absolute measure of the intervention's impact, which is often more useful for public health and clinical resourcing decisions than the relative measure.\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) of $40$ means that, on average, surgeons must use chlorhexidine–alcohol antisepsis on $40$ patients to prevent one additional SSI that would have occurred if povidone–iodine–alcohol had been used instead. A lower $NNT$ generally signifies a more effective intervention. An $NNT$ of $40$ for a frequent procedure suggests a clinically efficient and beneficial preventive strategy.",

This exercise introduces a fundamental concept from health economics, the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio ($ICER$), to evaluate whether a new prevention bundle is a sound financial investment.

            "problem": "A tertiary surgical center is considering a perioperative bundle to prevent Surgical Site Infection (SSI). The bundle is expected to change the per-case SSI probability from a baseline $p_{0} = 0.09$ to $p_{1} = 0.06$.

The expected cost per case, $E[\\text{Cost}_{0}]$, is the probability of an SSI, $p_{0}$, multiplied by the cost of an SSI, $C$.\n$$\nE[\\text{Cost}_{0}] = p_{0} C\n$$\n\nFor Strategy $1$ (perioperative bundle), the cost includes the fixed implementation cost of the bundle, $K$, plus the expected cost from any SSI that still occurs. The expected cost per case, $E[\\text{Cost}_{1}]$, is:\n$$\nE[\\text{Cost}_{1}] = K + p_{1} C\n$$\n\nThe incremental cost, $\\Delta \\text{Cost}$, is the difference in expected costs per case between Strategy $1$ and Strategy $0$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{Cost} = E[\\text{Cost}_{1}] - E[\\text{Cost}_{0}] = (K + p_{1} C) - (p_{0} C)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{Cost} = K + (p_{1} - p_{0})C = K - (p_{0} - p_{1})C\n$$\n\nNext, we define the effectiveness. The problem specifies the outcome as \"infections averted\". The incremental effect, $\\Delta \\text{Effect}$, is the reduction in the number of infections per case when using the bundle compared to standard care.\nThe number of infections per case under standard care is $p_{0}$.\nThe number of infections per case with the bundle is $p_{1}$.\nThe number of infections averted per case is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{Effect} = p_{0} - p_{1}\n$$\n\nNow, we can construct the ICER expression by dividing the incremental cost by the incremental effect:\n$$\n\\text{ICER} = \\frac{\\Delta \\text{Cost}}{\\Delta \\text{Effect}} = \\frac{K - (p_{0} - p_{1})C}{p_{0} - p_{1}}\n$$\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(C) = \\frac{K}{p_{0} - p_{1}} - C\n$$\nThis is the algebraic expression for the ICER as a function of the SSI cost, $C$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nGiven: $p_{0} = 0.09$, $p_{1} = 0.06$, and $K = 120$.\nFirst, calculate the incremental effect, $p_{0} - p_{1}$:\n$$\np_{0} - p_{1} = 0.09 - 0.06 = 0.03\n$$\nThis value represents $0.03$ infections averted per surgical case.\n\nNow, substitute this into the ICER formula:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(C) = \\frac{120}{0.03} - C\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(C) = 4000 - C\n$$\nThis is the required algebraic expression for the ICER in USD per infection averted, as a function of $C$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the base-case ICER by substituting the base-case value $C = 8000$:\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(C=8000) = 4000 - 8000\n$$\n$$\n\\text{ICER}(C=8000) = -4000\n$$\nThe base-case ICER is $-4000$ USD per infection averted.
