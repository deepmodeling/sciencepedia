            "problem": "A homogeneous, linearly poroelastic tissue saturated with interstitial fluid occupies a planar slab of thickness $L$ in the $x$-direction. Let $p(x,t)$ denote the interstitial fluid pressure, assumed to vary only along $x$ due to planar symmetry (one-dimensional, $1$D). Under small strains and negligible inertia, use the following fundamental ingredients to obtain the governing equation for $p(x,t)$: local conservation of fluid mass, Darcy’s law for flow through a porous elastic solid, and a linear storage relation characterized by the Biot modulus $c$.\n\nSpecifically, use:\n- Fluid mass balance: $\\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$, where $\\zeta$ is the increment of fluid content per unit reference volume and $\\mathbf{q}$ is the Darcy flux.\n- Darcy’s law: $\\mathbf{q} = - k \\nabla p$, where $k$ is the hydraulic conductivity (a scalar, constant, isotropic).\n- Linear storage: $\\zeta = c\\,p$, where $c$ is the Biot modulus (with units of inverse pressure).\n\nAssume $k$ and $c$ are constants in space and time, and there are no sources or sinks.\n\nThen, perform a nondimensionalization of the resulting transient consolidation equation by introducing characteristic scales $L$ for length, $t_c$ for time, and $p_0$ for pressure, and defining the dimensionless variables $x^{\\ast} = x/L$, $t^{\\ast} = t/t_c$, and $p^{\\ast} = p/p_0$. Choose $t_c$ such that the dimensionless equation has unit prefactor multiplying the second spatial derivative, yielding the canonical diffusion form in $1$D: $\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}}$.\n\nProvide the characteristic time scale $t_c$ in closed-form as a function of $L$, $c$, and $k$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and poroelasticity, is well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided equations—conservation of mass, Darcy's law, and a linear storage relation—are the standard components for deriving the linear transient consolidation equation. The task is to first derive this governing equation and then use nondimensionalization to find a specific characteristic time scale.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two parts. First, we derive the governing partial differential equation for the interstitial fluid pressure $p(x,t)$. Second, we nondimensionalize this equation to find the characteristic time scale $t_c$.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Governing Equation\n\nThe problem provides three fundamental relations:\n1.  Fluid mass balance: $\\frac{\\partial \\zeta}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0$, where $\\zeta$ is the increment of fluid content and $\\mathbf{q}$ is the Darcy flux.\n2.  Darcy’s law: $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla p$, where $k$ is the constant hydraulic conductivity.\n3.  Linear storage relation: $\\zeta = c\\,p$, where $c$ is the constant Biot modulus.\n\nWe begin by substituting the linear storage relation (3) into the mass balance equation (1).\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (c\\,p)}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0\n$$\nSince the Biot modulus $c$ is given as a constant, it can be taken out of the time derivative:\n$$\nc \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0\n$$\nNext, we substitute Darcy's law (2) into this intermediate equation:\n$$\nc \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (-k \\nabla p) = 0\n$$\nGiven that the hydraulic conductivity $k$ is also a constant, it can be factored out of the divergence operator:\n$$\nc \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - k (\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla p) = 0\n$$\nThe expression $\\nabla \\cdot \\nabla p$ is the definition of the Laplacian operator, written as $\\nabla^2 p$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nc \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - k \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the general form of the consolidation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{c} \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nThe problem specifies a one-dimensional ($1$D) system where the pressure $p$ varies only with the spatial coordinate $x$ and time $t$. Therefore, the Laplacian operator simplifies to the second partial derivative with respect to $x$: $\\nabla^2 p = \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}$. The governing equation in $1$D is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{k}{c} \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is a diffusion equation where the hydraulic diffusivity is $D = k/c$.\n\nPart 2: Nondimensionalization and Determination of $t_c$\n\nWe are given the following dimensionless variables, defined using the characteristic scales $L$ for length, $t_c$ for time, and $p_0$ for pressure:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{x}{L}, \\quad t^{\\ast} = \\frac{t}{t_c}, \\quad p^{\\ast} = \\frac{p}{p_0}\n$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express the dimensional variables in terms of the dimensionless ones:\n$$\nx = L x^{\\ast}, \\quad t = t_c t^{\\ast}, \\quad p = p_0 p^{\\ast}\n$$\nWe now transform the partial derivatives from the governing equation using the chain rule.\nThe time derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (p_0 p^{\\ast})}{\\partial t} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} \\frac{\\partial t^{\\ast}}{\\partial t} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} \\left(\\frac{1}{t_c}\\right) = \\frac{p_0}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}}\n$$\nThe second spatial derivative is found by applying the chain rule twice:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (p_0 p^{\\ast})}{\\partial x} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial x} = p_0 \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{p_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{p_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\right) = \\frac{p_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial x^{\\ast}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{p_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{p_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions for the derivatives back into the dimensional governing equation:\n$$\n\\frac{p_0}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k}{c} \\left( \\frac{p_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic pressure $p_0$ cancels from both sides, as it must for a properly scaled equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_c} \\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k}{c L^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}}\n$$\nTo obtain the canonical dimensionless form, we isolate the time derivative term by multiplying the entire equation by $t_c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\left( \\frac{k t_c}{c L^2} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires that this equation match the form $\\frac{\\partial p^{\\ast}}{\\partial t^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\partial^2 p^{\\ast}}{\\partial x^{\\ast 2}}$, which implies that the prefactor multiplying the second spatial derivative must be equal to $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{k t_c}{c L^2} = 1\n$$\nSolving this algebraic equation for the characteristic time scale $t_c$ gives:\n$$\nt_c = \\frac{c L^2}{k}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic time for pressure diffusion in the poroelastic medium.",

It is a canonical problem in nonlinear solid mechanics. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Augmented Functional and Optimality Conditions\n\nThe principle of stationary total potential energy states that the equilibrium configuration of a conservative mechanical system minimizes the total potential energy. The total potential energy functional, $\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}]$, is the sum of the stored strain energy and the potential of the external loads.\n\n1.  **Stored Strain Energy**: The internal strain energy stored in the body is the integral of the strain-energy density over the reference volume:\n    $$U_{\\mathrm{int}}[\\boldsymbol{u}] = \\int_{\\Omega_0} W_{\\mathrm{iso}}(\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{u})) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\n\n2.  **Potential of External Loads**: The potential of the external loads is the negative of the work done by these loads. With no body forces and prescribed tractions $\\boldsymbol{t}_0$ on $\\Gamma_N$, this potential is:\n    $$U_{\\mathrm{ext}}[\\boldsymbol{u}] = - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$$\n    Note that the work is done on the displacement $\\boldsymbol{u}$ at the points where the traction is applied.\n\n3.  **Total Potential Energy**: The total potential energy is the sum of these two terms:\n    $$\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}] = U_{\\mathrm{int}}[\\boldsymbol{u}] + U_{\\mathrm{ext}}[\\boldsymbol{u}] = \\int_{\\Omega_0} W_{\\mathrm{iso}}(\\boldsymbol{F}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A$$\n\n4.  **Enforcement of Incompressibility**: The problem must be solved subject to the kinematic constraint $J(\\boldsymbol{X}) = 1$ for all $\\boldsymbol{X} \\in \\Omega_0$. This is an equality constraint of the form $g(\\boldsymbol{u}) = J(\\boldsymbol{u}) - 1 = 0$. Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we introduce a field $p(\\boldsymbol{X})$ and construct the augmented potential energy functional (or Lagrangian) $\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p]$:\n    $$\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p] = \\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}] + \\int_{\\Omega_0} p(\\boldsymbol{X}) (J(\\boldsymbol{X}) - 1) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}]$, we get:\n    $$ \\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p] = \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\Big( W_{\\mathrm{iso}}(\\boldsymbol{F}) + p(J-1) \\Big) \\, \\mathrm{d}V - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    The sign of the Lagrange multiplier term is a convention; the chosen sign is consistent with Option A. The fields $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and $p$ are now treated as independent variables.\n\n5.  **First-Order Optimality Conditions (KKT/Euler-Lagrange Equations)**: We find the stationary point of $\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p]$ by setting its first variation with respect to both $\\boldsymbol{u}$ and $p$ to zero.\n\n    **Variation with respect to $p$**: Let $\\delta p$ be an arbitrary variation of the pressure field.\n    $$\\delta_p \\Pi = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} \\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p + \\epsilon \\delta p] \\Big|_{\\epsilon=0} = \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\delta p (J-1) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = 0$$\n    Since this must hold for any arbitrary variation $\\delta p$, the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations implies that the term multiplying $\\delta p$ must be zero everywhere in the domain:\n    $$J-1 = 0 \\quad \\text{in } \\Omega_0$$\n    This recovers the incompressibility constraint. As this is an equality constraint, the Lagrange multiplier $p$ is unrestricted in sign, and there are no complementarity conditions.\n\n    **Variation with respect to $\\boldsymbol{u}$**: Let $\\boldsymbol{v}$ be an admissible variation of the displacement field, which must satisfy $\\boldsymbol{v}=\\boldsymbol{0}$ on the Dirichlet boundary $\\Gamma_D$. The variation of $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is $\\delta\\boldsymbol{F} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\boldsymbol{v}$.\n    $$\\delta_{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\Pi = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} \\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u} + \\epsilon \\boldsymbol{v}, p] \\Big|_{\\epsilon=0} = 0$$\n    Taking the variation of each term in $\\Pi[\\boldsymbol{u}, p]$:\n    $$ \\delta_{\\boldsymbol{u}} \\Pi = \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial W_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{F}} : \\delta\\boldsymbol{F} + p \\, \\delta J \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}V - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\n    Using the given relation $\\delta J = \\operatorname{Cof}\\boldsymbol{F} : \\delta\\boldsymbol{F}$ and substituting $\\delta\\boldsymbol{F} = \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\boldsymbol{v}$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial W_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{F}} + p \\, \\operatorname{Cof}\\boldsymbol{F} \\right) : \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}V - \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\n    We identify the term in parentheses as the total first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{P}$:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{P} = \\frac{\\partial W_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{F}} + p \\, \\operatorname{Cof}\\boldsymbol{F} $$\n    The variational equation becomes the principle of virtual work:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{P} : \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{X}} \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    Using integration by parts (the divergence theorem) on the left-hand side, $\\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{P}:\\nabla\\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{N}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A - \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\operatorname{Div}\\boldsymbol{P}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V$.\n    The equation becomes:\n    $$ \\int_{\\partial \\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{N}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A - \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\operatorname{Div}\\boldsymbol{P}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    Since $\\boldsymbol{v} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ on $\\Gamma_D$, the boundary integral is only over $\\Gamma_N$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{N}) \\, \\mathrm{d}A - \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\operatorname{Div}\\boldsymbol{P}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V = \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{t}_0 \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v} \\, \\mathrm{d}A $$\n    Rearranging gives:\n    $$ \\int_{\\Omega_0} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (-\\operatorname{Div}\\boldsymbol{P}) \\, \\mathrm{d}V + \\int_{\\Gamma_N} \\boldsymbol{v} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{N} - \\boldsymbol{t}_0) \\, \\mathrm{d}A = 0 $$\n    For this to hold for all admissible variations $\\boldsymbol{v}$, the terms in the integrands must be zero. This yields the strong form of the equilibrium equations:\n    -   Equilibrium in the bulk: $\\operatorname{Div}\\boldsymbol{P} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ in $\\Omega_0$.\n    -   Natural (Neumann) boundary condition: $\\boldsymbol{P}\\boldsymbol{N} = \\boldsymbol{t}_0$ on $\\Gamma_N$.\n    The essential (Dirichlet) boundary condition $\\boldsymbol{u} = \\bar{\\boldsymbol{u}}$ on $\\Gamma_D$ is imposed by construction of the function space for $\\boldsymbol{u}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.

The option states $\\boldsymbol{P} = \\frac{\\partial W_{\\mathrm{iso}}}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{F}} - p \\, \\boldsymbol{F}^{-\\mathsf{T}}$.

These are the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for an *inequality* constraint. However, the problem specifies an *equality* constraint $J=1$.

The problem explicitly asks for a formulation using a Lagrange multiplier field $p(\\boldsymbol{X})$.\n-   **Method**: This is an alternative approach for handling near-incompressibility, but it does not produce a Lagrange multiplier field directly and only satisfies the constraint exactly in the limit $\\kappa \\to \\infty$.

The condition $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$ is the incompressibility constraint for *infinitesimal* (small) strain theory.

The expression $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}$ is only a first-order approximation of $J-1$. This constitutes a fundamental modeling error.\n-   **Stress Expression**: The resulting stress term is also inconsistent with the correct formulation for finite strain incompressibility.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady, small-strain linear poroelastic medium occupying the spatial domain $x \\in [0,1]$. The governing equations follow from quasistatic mechanical equilibrium and Darcy-type fluid flux conservation based on the Biot theory of poroelasticity. Let $u(x)$ denote the displacement field and $p(x)$ denote the pore pressure field. The mechanical equilibrium equation is given by\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dx}\\sigma(x) = f(x),\n$$\nwhere the Cauchy stress is\n$$\n\\sigma(x) = E \\frac{du}{dx}(x) - \\alpha p(x),\n$$\nwith $E$ the Young's modulus and $\\alpha$ the Biot coefficient. The steady fluid mass conservation reduces to\n$$\n-\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\kappa \\frac{dp}{dx}(x)\\right) = s(x),\n$$\nwith $\\kappa$ the hydraulic conductivity and $s(x)$ a source term.\n\nTo enable a rigorous numerical mesh convergence study, use the method of manufactured solutions. Prescribe smooth, exact fields\n$$\nu^\\star(x) = \\sin(\\pi x), \\quad p^\\star(x) = \\cos(2\\pi x),\n$$\nand impose Dirichlet boundary conditions consistent with these exact fields,\n$$\nu(0) = u^\\star(0), \\quad u(1) = u^\\star(1), \\quad p(0) = p^\\star(0), \\quad p(1) = p^\\star(1).\n$$\nFrom the governing equations, derive forcing terms $f(x)$ and $s(x)$ such that $(u^\\star, p^\\star)$ is the exact solution of the continuous problem for arbitrary constants $E  0$, $\\alpha \\ge 0$, and $\\kappa  0$. Specifically, starting from the definitions and applying elementary calculus,\n$$\nf(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(E \\frac{du^\\star}{dx}(x) - \\alpha p^\\star(x)\\right) = -E \\frac{d^2 u^\\star}{dx^2}(x) + \\alpha \\frac{dp^\\star}{dx}(x),\n$$\nand\n$$\ns(x) = -\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\kappa \\frac{dp^\\star}{dx}(x)\\right) = -\\kappa \\frac{d^2 p^\\star}{dx^2}(x).\n$$\n\nDiscretize the domain with a uniform grid of $N$ points, spacing $h = 1/(N-1)$, and approximate derivatives using second-order centered finite differences.

Report the average of the rates over all successive pairs.\n\nInterpret the observed convergence rates for the displacement and pore pressure in terms of the order of accuracy of the chosen centered finite difference scheme. Use the following three scientifically meaningful parameter sets as a test suite:\n1. Case A (coupled, smooth forcing): $E = 1.3$, $\\alpha = 0.8$, $\\kappa = 0.6$.\n2. Case B (decoupled mechanics): $E = 2.0$, $\\alpha = 0.0$, $\\kappa = 0.6$.\n3. Case C (stiffer pressure operator): $E = 1.1$, $\\alpha = 0.5$, $\\kappa = 0.05$.\n\nAll quantities are dimensionless for this study.

Derive the explicit forms of the forcing terms $f(x)$ and $s(x)$.\n2.  Formulate the linear algebraic systems resulting from the finite difference discretization.\n3.  Design an algorithm to solve these systems for a sequence of grid resolutions.\n4.  Compute the specified error norms and calculate the average convergence rates.\n\n**1. Analytical Forcing Terms**\nGiven the manufactured solutions:\n$u^\\star(x) = \\sin(\\pi x)$\n$p^\\star(x) = \\cos(2\\pi x)$\n\nWe compute their derivatives:\n$\\frac{du^\\star}{dx} = \\pi \\cos(\\pi x)$\n$\\frac{d^2u^\\star}{dx^2} = -\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)$\n\n$\\frac{dp^\\star}{dx} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n$\\frac{d^2p^\\star}{dx^2} = -4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi x)$\n\nSubstituting these into the definitions for $f(x)$ and $s(x)$:\n$s(x) = -\\kappa \\frac{d^2p^\\star}{dx^2} = -\\kappa (-4\\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi x)) = 4\\kappa \\pi^2 \\cos(2\\pi x)$\n$f(x) = -E \\frac{d^2u^\\star}{dx^2} + \\alpha \\frac{dp^\\star}{dx} = -E (-\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x)) + \\alpha (-2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x)) = E\\pi^2 \\sin(\\pi x) - 2\\alpha\\pi \\sin(2\\pi x)$\n\n**2. Discretized System Formulation**\nThe problem is solved sequentially: first for pressure $p$, then for displacement $u$.\n\n**Pressure System:** The equation for internal nodes $i=1, \\dots, N-2$ is:\n$$-\\kappa \\frac{p_{i-1} - 2p_i + p_{i+1}}{h^2} = s(x_i)$$\nThis can be written as a linear system $\\mathbf{A}_p \\mathbf{p}_{int} = \\mathbf{b}_p$, where $\\mathbf{p}_{int} = [p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{N-2}]^T$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}_p$ is an $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ tridiagonal matrix with entries:\n- Diagonal: $2\\kappa/h^2$\n- Off-diagonals: $-\\kappa/h^2$\n\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}_p$ incorporates the source term $s(x_i)$ and the boundary conditions $p_0=p^\\star(x_0)$ and $p_{N-1}=p^\\star(x_{N-1})$. For $i=1, \\dots, N-2$:\n- $b_{p,i} = s(x_i)$\nThe boundary conditions are handled by modifying the first and last equations:\n- For $i=1$: $\\frac{2\\kappa}{h^2} p_1 - \\frac{\\kappa}{h^2} p_2 = s(x_1) + \\frac{\\kappa}{h^2} p_0$\n- For $i=N-2$: $-\\frac{\\kappa}{h^2} p_{N-3} + \\frac{2\\kappa}{h^2} p_{N-2} = s(x_{N-2}) + \\frac{\\kappa}{h^2} p_{N-1}$\nSo, the RHS vector becomes: $b_{p,1} \\to b_{p,1} + \\frac{\\kappa}{h^2}p_0$ and $b_{p,N-2} \\to b_{p,N-2} + \\frac{\\kappa}{h^2}p_{N-1}$.\n\n**Displacement System:** After solving for the numerical pressure $p_i$, we solve for the displacement $u_i$. The equation for internal nodes $i=1, \\dots, N-2$ is:\n$$-E \\frac{u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}}{h^2} + \\alpha \\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i-1}}{2h} = f(x_i)$$\nThis is another linear system $\\mathbf{A}_u \\mathbf{u}_{int} = \\mathbf{b}_u$, where $\\mathbf{u}_{int}=[u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{N-2}]^T$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}_u$ is an $(N-2) \\times (N-2)$ tridiagonal matrix with entries:\n- Diagonal: $2E/h^2$\n- Off-diagonals: $-E/h^2$\n\nThe right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}_u$ is formed from the forcing term and the now-known pressure gradient term:\n$$b_{u,i} = f(x_i) - \\alpha \\frac{p_{i+1} - p_{i-1}}{2h}$$\nThe boundary conditions $u_0=u^\\star(x_0)$ and $u_{N-1}=u^\\star(x_{N-1})$ are incorporated similarly to the pressure system:\n- $b_{u,1} \\to b_{u,1} + \\frac{E}{h^2}u_0$\n- $b_{u,N-2} \\to b_{u,N-2} + \\frac{E}{h^2}u_{N-1}$\n\n**3. Error Calculation and Convergence Rate**\n- **$L^2$ error**: $\\|q - q^\\star\\|_{L^2_h} = \\left( h \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} (q_i - q^\\star(x_i))^2 \\right)^{1/2}$ is computed using the full solution vectors $(q_0, \\dots, q_{N-1})$ and the exact solution evaluated on the grid.\n- **$H^1$ seminorm error**: $|q - q^\\star|_{H^1_h} = \\left( h \\sum_{i=1}^{N-2} \\left( \\frac{q_{i+1} - q_{i-1}}{2h} - \\frac{dq^\\star}{dx}(x_i) \\right)^2 \\right)^{1/2}$ is computed using the numerical solution and the exact derivative on the interior grid points.\n- **Convergence Rate**: For each error type, a series of errors $[E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4]$ is obtained for $N \\in [16, 32, 64, 128]$. Three rates are computed: $\\rho_1 = \\log(E_1/E_2)/\\log(2)$, $\\rho_2 = \\log(E_2/E_3)/\\log(2)$, and $\\rho_3 = \\log(E_3/E_4)/\\log(2)$. The reported rate is the average $(\\rho_1+\\rho_2+\\rho_3)/3$.\n\n**4. Algorithm**\nThe main algorithm proceeds as follows for each test case $(E, \\alpha, \\kappa)$:\n1. Initialize four empty lists to store the errors for each of the four error metrics across different grid sizes.\n2. Loop through a sequence of grid sizes $N \\in \\{16, 32, 64, 128\\}$.\n   a. Define the grid: $h = 1/(N-1)$, $x_i = i h$.\n   b. Evaluate the exact solutions $u^\\star, p^\\star$ and source terms $f, s$ on the grid.\n   c. Assemble and solve the linear system for the pressure field $p$.\n   d. Assemble and solve the linear system for the displacement field $u$, using the computed pressure field $p$.\n   e. Compute the four error norms ($L^2$ for $u$, $L^2$ for $p$, $H^1$ for $u$, $H^1$ for $p$).\n   f. Append each error to its corresponding list.\n3. For each of the four error lists, compute the average convergence rate.\n4. Return the four average rates for the test case.\n5. The main function will execute this for all three test cases and format the results as specified.\n\nThe centered finite difference schemes for both the second derivative (Laplacian) and first derivative (gradient) are second-order accurate ($O(h^2)$). Therefore, the point-wise error in the solution is expected to be $O(h^2)$. The $L^2$ norm, which involves an integral, will also be $O(h^2)$. The $H^1$ seminorm, which measures the error in the derivative, is also expected to converge with order $2$ for this scheme. Thus, all computed rates should be close to $2.0$.",
