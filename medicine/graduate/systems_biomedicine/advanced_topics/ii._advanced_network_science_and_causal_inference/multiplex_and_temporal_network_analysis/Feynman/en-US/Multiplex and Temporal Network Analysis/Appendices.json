Unlike a simple graph, a multiplex network requires a structure that captures both connections within layers and links between them. This exercise  provides hands-on practice with two common representations: the comprehensive supra-adjacency matrix and the simplified aggregated matrix. By constructing these matrices and comparing a node's degree in each, you will gain a concrete understanding of how the choice of representation can alter network metrics and what information is lost when layers are flattened.",

            "problem": "In systems biomedicine, multiplex networks model distinct interaction modalities among the same biological entities. Consider a two-layer multiplex network with shared node set $\\{R, K, T\\}$ corresponding to a cell-surface receptor $R$, a cytosolic kinase $K$, and a transcription factor $T$. The two layers are:\n- Layer $\\mathcal{P}$: protein-protein interaction (PPI).\n- Layer $\\mathcal{G}$: gene regulatory interaction (GRI).\n\nWithin each layer, edges are undirected and have positive weights that model an effective traversal cost (for example, the inverse of interaction reliability or an effective energetic barrier), and shortest-path cost is the sum of edge weights along the path. Interlayer coupling connects a node to its counterpart across layers; switching layers at any node incurs an additive penalty $\\gamma > 0$ through an interlayer edge of weight $\\gamma$. This penalty models the mechanistic cost of switching modalities during signal transduction. Assume the following intralayer edge weights:\n- In layer $\\mathcal{P}$: $R\\text{--}K$ has weight $1$, and $K\\text{--}T$ has weight $9$.\n- In layer $\\mathcal{G}$: $R\\text{--}K$ has weight $3$, and $K\\text{--}T$ has weight $4$.\n\nAll interlayer edges $R^{\\mathcal{P}}\\text{--}R^{\\mathcal{G}}$, $K^{\\mathcal{P}}\\text{--}K^{\\mathcal{G}}$, and $T^{\\mathcal{P}}\\text{--}T^{\\mathcal{G}}$ have weight $\\gamma$.

Express your final answer as the exact value of $\\gamma^{\\star}$ with no rounding. No physical units are required for $\\gamma$.",
            "solution": "The problem is to find the shortest path from node $R$ to node $T$ in a two-layer multiplex network. This can be conceptualized as finding the shortest path in an expanded graph containing $6$ nodes: $\\{R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}, R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$. The 'source' is the set $\\{R^{\\mathcal{P}}, R^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$ and the 'target' is the set $\\{T^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}\\}$.\n\nA path from $R$ to $T$ must pass through $K$, as no direct $R\\text{--}T$ edges are specified. We must consider all possible valid paths and their costs. A path can either remain within a single layer or switch between layers.\n\nLet us analyze the costs of the primary path categories:\n\n1.  **Path entirely in Layer $\\mathcal{P}$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n    The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{P}}$, is the sum of the weights of the intralayer edges:\n    $$C_{\\mathcal{P}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}) + w(K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}) = 1 + 9 = 10$$\n\n2.  **Path entirely in Layer $\\mathcal{G}$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$.\n    The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{G}}$, is the sum of the weights of the intralayer edges:\n    $$C_{\\mathcal{G}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}) + w(K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}) = 3 + 4 = 7$$\n\n3.  **Paths that switch layers:** A layer switch can occur at any node ($R$, $K$, or $T$). A switch introduces a cost of $\\gamma$.\n    - A switch at the start node $R$ (e.g., $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$) or the end node $T$ (e.g., $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$) is suboptimal. For example, the cost of switching at $R$ and then traversing layer $\\mathcal{G}$ is $\\gamma + C_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\gamma + 7$. Since $\\gamma > 0$, this is strictly greater than $C_{\\mathcal{G}} = 7$. A similar argument holds for switching at $T$.\n    - Paths with more than one switch are also suboptimal. For instance, $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$ incurs two switching costs ($2\\gamma$), making it more expensive than a single-switch path.\n    - The most efficient switching paths are those that switch exactly once at the intermediate node, $K$. There are two such possibilities:\n\n    a.  **Switch from $\\mathcal{P}$ to $\\mathcal{G}$ at $K$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$.\n        The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}$, is the sum of weights of the first segment in $\\mathcal{P}$, the interlayer jump at $K$, and the second segment in $\\mathcal{G}$:\n        $$C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{P}}, K^{\\mathcal{P}}) + \\gamma + w(K^{\\mathcal{G}}, T^{\\mathcal{G}}) = 1 + \\gamma + 4 = 5 + \\gamma$$\n\n    b.  **Switch from $\\mathcal{G}$ to $\\mathcal{P}$ at $K$:** The path is $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{P}}$.\n        The cost, $C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}}$, is calculated similarly:\n        $$C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}} = w(R^{\\mathcal{G}}, K^{\\mathcal{G}}) + \\gamma + w(K^{\\mathcal{P}}, T^{\\mathcal{P}}) = 3 + \\gamma + 9 = 12 + \\gamma$$\n\nThe effective shortest-path cost, $C_{min}(\\gamma)$, is the minimum of the costs of all viable paths:\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(C_{\\mathcal{P}}, C_{\\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}})$$\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(10, 7, 5 + \\gamma, 12 + \\gamma)$$\n\nSince $\\gamma > 0$, we know that $12 + \\gamma > 12$, so $C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}} = 12 + \\gamma$ is always greater than $C_{\\mathcal{P}}=10$ and $C_{\\mathcal{G}}=7$. Thus, this path is never optimal. The expression simplifies to:\n$$C_{min}(\\gamma) = \\min(10, 7, 5 + \\gamma) = \\min(7, 5 + \\gamma)$$\n\nThis equation provides the shortest-path cost as a function of $\\gamma$:\n- If $5 + \\gamma < 7$, the shortest path is the switching path $R^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{P}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$ with cost $5 + \\gamma$. This occurs when $\\gamma < 2$.\n- If $5 + \\gamma > 7$, the shortest path is the single-layer path $R^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow K^{\\mathcal{G}} \\rightarrow T^{\\mathcal{G}}$ with cost $7$. This occurs when $\\gamma > 2$.\n- If $5 + \\gamma = 7$, both paths are equally optimal. This occurs when $\\gamma = 2$.\n\nThe critical value $\\gamma^{\\star}$ is the value of $\\gamma$ at which the optimal path strategy changes. This transition occurs when the cost of the best single-layer path equals the cost of the best switching path.\n\nThe best single-layer path cost is $\\min(C_{\\mathcal{P}}, C_{\\mathcal{G}}) = \\min(10, 7) = 7$.\nThe best switching path cost is $\\min(C_{\\mathcal{P} \\to \\mathcal{G}}, C_{\\mathcal{G} \\to \\mathcal{P}}) = \\min(5 + \\gamma, 12 + \\gamma) = 5+\\gamma$.\n\nSetting these two costs equal to find the critical point $\\gamma^{\\star}$:\n$$7 = 5 + \\gamma^{\\star}$$\n$$\\gamma^{\\star} = 7 - 5 = 2$$\n\nFor $0 < \\gamma < 2$, the optimal path switches layers because $5+\\gamma < 7$.\nFor $\\gamma > 2$, the optimal path remains within layer $\\mathcal{G}$ because $7 < 5+\\gamma$.\nAt $\\gamma = \\gamma^{\\star} = 2$, the two path types have the same cost, and the behavior of the optimal path changes.",

The latency is defined as the difference between the earliest possible arrival time at the target and the start time. This is equivalent to a shortest path problem on a time-aware, layer-aware graph, where the path \"length\" is the arrival time. We can solve this by systematically exploring all possible paths from the source to the target and computing their respective arrival times, or by employing a Dijkstra-like algorithm on the state space defined by (node, time, last layer).\n\nThe state of a signal can be described by its current location (node), the time of arrival at that node, and the layer of the contact that was traversed to reach it. The last piece of information is necessary to correctly apply the inter-layer switching penalty $s$. Let $T(u, \\mathcal{L}_{\\ell})$ be the earliest arrival time at node $u$ via a contact on layer $\\mathcal{L}_{\\ell}$. The initial condition is at node $N_{0}$ at time $t_{0} = 2$. No contacts have been traversed, so there is no \"last layer\".\n\nThe rule for calculating the arrival time at a node $v$ from a node $u$ via a contact $(u,v)$ on layer $\\mathcal{L}_{\\ell}$ activated at time $t$ is:\nArrival Time at $v$ = $\\max(\\text{Departure Time from } u, t) + d_{\\ell} + (\\text{penalty})$.\nThe departure time from $u$ is the arrival time at $u$.

The layer-aggregated directed graph contains an edge $(u,v)$ if a contact from $u$ to $v$ exists on any layer at any time. The contacts include $(N_{0}, N_{1}), (N_{0}, N_{2}), (N_{0}, N_{4}),$ and $(N_{0}, N_{5})$. Since there is a direct edge $(N_{0}, N_{5})$, the shortest path in terms of number of hops (edges) is $1$. The minimum-latency path, $N_{0} \\to N_{4} \\to N_{5}$, has a hop length of $2$. The static shortest path ($1$ hop) corresponds to a latency of $108 - 2 = 106$ minutes, whereas the temporally optimal path ($2$ hops) has a much smaller latency of $10$ minutes. This highlights a fundamental distinction in network analysis: the topologically shortest path in a static graph aggregation can be highly suboptimal when temporal dynamics and traversal costs are considered. The temporal constraints (activation times) and multiplex costs (layer switching) are critical factors that determine the true optimal path in a dynamic system.\n\nThe minimum latency is $10$ minutes.",
