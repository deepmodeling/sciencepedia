The provided matrices are:\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & -3\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad B=\\begin{bmatrix}0 \\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe controllability of an LTI system is determined by the rank of its controllability matrix, denoted as $\\mathcal{C}$. For a system of dimension $n$, the controllability matrix is constructed as:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \\cdots & A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe system is controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which means $\\operatorname{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = n$. This is known as the Kalman rank condition for controllability.\n\nFor the given system, the state dimension is $n=2$. Therefore, the controllability matrix is given by:\n$$\n\\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the input matrix $B$ itself:\n$$\nB = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe second column of $\\mathcal{C}$ is the product of the state matrix $A$ and the input matrix $B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the observability of a given two-dimensional linear time-invariant (LTI) system, which models a simplified receptor-effector cascade near a steady state. The system dynamics are described by the state-space representation $\\dot{x} = Ax$ and the output equation is $y = Cx$, where $x$ is the state vector, $A$ is the state matrix, and $C$ is the output matrix.\n\nThe provided matrices are:\n$$ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n$$ C = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe state vector is $x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} \\\\ x_{2} \\end{bmatrix}$, so the dimension of the state space is $n=2$.\n\nThe concept of observability addresses whether it is possible to uniquely determine the initial state of the system, $x(0)$, by observing the system's output, $y(t)$, over a finite time interval. For an LTI system, this property is determined by the Kalman rank condition for observability.\n\nAccording to this foundational definition, the system pair $(A, C)$ is observable if and only if the observability matrix, denoted by $\\mathcal{O}$, has full column rank. The rank of the observability matrix must be equal to the dimension of the state space, $n$.\n\nThe general form of the observability matrix for an $n$-dimensional system is a block matrix constructed by stacking the output matrix $C$ and its successive mappings by the state matrix $A$:\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\\\ CA^2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ CA^{n-1} \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThis matrix has dimensions $(p \\cdot n) \\times n$, where $p$ is the number of outputs (in this case, $p=1$) and $n$ is the number of states. For the given system, the state dimension is $n=2$, so the observability matrix takes the specific form:\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{bmatrix} $$\nTo construct this matrix, we must first compute the product $CA$.\n$$ CA = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication yields:\n$$ CA = \\begin{bmatrix} (1)(0) + (0)(0) & (1)(1) + (0)(0) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nNow, we can assemble the observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ by vertically stacking the row vector $C$ and the newly computed row vector $CA$:\n$$ \\mathcal{O} = \\begin{bmatrix} C \\\\ CA \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $$\nThe resulting observability matrix $\\mathcal{O}$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix, commonly denoted as $I_2$.\n\nTo determine if the system is observable, we must find the rank of $\\mathcal{O}$. The rank of a matrix is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. The identity matrix $I_2$ has two rows, $\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$. These two vectors are orthogonal and therefore are linearly independent. Consequently, the rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is $2$.\n$$ \\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = \\text{rank} \\left( \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\right) = 2 $$\nThe Kalman rank condition for observability states that the system is observable if and only if $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = n$. In this problem, we have found that $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{O}) = 2$, and the dimension of the state space is $n=2$. Since the rank of the observability matrix is equal to the dimension of the state space, the condition is satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the system pair $(A, C)$ is observable. This implies that by measuring the output $y(t)$, which corresponds to the deviation in receptor occupancy $x_{1}(t)$, one can uniquely determine the initial state of both the receptor occupancy $x_{1}(0)$ and the downstream effector activity $x_{2}(0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the rank of the observability matrix as the final numerical answer.

In the bipartite graph this means both $G_{2}$ (right) and $G_{3}$ (right) can only be matched by using the same left node $G_{1}$, so at most one of them can be matched; at least one of $\\{G_{2},G_{3}\\}$ (right) is unmatched.\n\nAn explicit matching of size $5$ is\n$$\n\\{\\,G_{7}\\to G_{1},\\; G_{1}\\to G_{2},\\; G_{2}\\to G_{4},\\; G_{3}\\to G_{5},\\; G_{4}\\to G_{6}\\,\\},\n$$\nwhich matches the right nodes $\\{G_{1},G_{2},G_{4},G_{5},G_{6}\\}$.
