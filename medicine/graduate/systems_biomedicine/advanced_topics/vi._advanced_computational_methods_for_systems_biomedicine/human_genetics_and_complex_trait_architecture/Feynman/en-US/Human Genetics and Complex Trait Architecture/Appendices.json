This practice guides you through the logic of the classical twin study, a powerful natural experiment for estimating narrow-sense heritability ($h^2$). By comparing the resemblance of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, you will derive the core equations of the ACE model and critically evaluate its underlying assumptions and limitations, such as the confounding between shared environment and genetic dominance .",

            "problem": "A complex quantitative trait is measured in a large twin registry drawn from a single, panmictic population. Assume the following foundational premises from quantitative genetics and the classical twin design: (i) the trait variance can be decomposed into additive genetic variance, shared environmental variance, and unique environmental variance; (ii) Monozygotic (MZ) twins share nearly all segregating alleles identical by descent across the genome, whereas Dizygotic (DZ) twins share, on average, half; (iii) the Equal Environments Assumption (EEA) holds, and there is no assortative mating, gene–environment correlation, or gene–environment interaction; and (iv) measurement error contributes to the unique environmental variance component. Let the phenotypic variance be scaled to unity.\n\nDefine the additive genetic variance as $V_{A}$, the shared environmental variance as $V_{C}$, and the unique environmental variance as $V_{E}$. Let the observed within-pair correlations for the trait be $r_{MZ} = 0.68$ for monozygotic twins and $r_{DZ} = 0.44$ for dizygotic twins.\n\nUsing only the foundational premises above, derive the expressions for the expected within-pair correlations for monozygotic and dizygotic twins as functions of $V_{A}$, $V_{C}$, and $V_{E}$ in the Additive genetics–Common environment–Unique environment (ACE) model, and from these, obtain an estimator for the narrow-sense heritability $h^{2}$ in terms of $r_{MZ}$ and $r_{DZ}$. Then compute the numerical value of $h^{2}$ using the provided correlations. Express your final heritability as a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n\nFinally, based on the same premises, analyze the identifiability of the shared environmental variance $V_{C}$ versus dominance genetic variance $V_{D}$ when only $r_{MZ}$ and $r_{DZ}$ are available, and formalize the condition under which the pattern of $r_{DZ}$ relative to $\\tfrac{1}{2} r_{MZ}$ is informative about whether shared environment or dominance is the more plausible source of excess resemblance beyond additivity. Do not introduce any additional data sources beyond twin correlations in your analysis.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of quantitative genetics, specifically the classical twin study design. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient and consistent information to derive the requested quantities and analyses. Its language is objective and employs standard terminology from the field.\n\nThe problem asks for several derivations and a calculation based on the Additive genetics–Common environment–Unique environment (ACE) model, followed by a theoretical analysis of model identifiability.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Twin Correlations in the ACE Model**\n\nThe foundational model for the phenotype, $P$, of an individual is given by the sum of its constituent components:\n$$ P = A + C + E $$\nwhere $A$ represents the additive genetic effect, $C$ represents the shared or common environmental effect, and $E$ represents the unique or non-shared environmental effect.\n\nThe total phenotypic variance, $V_P$, is the sum of the variances of these components, assuming they are uncorrelated as per the problem statement's premises:\n$$ V_P = V_A + V_C + V_E $$\nThe problem specifies that the phenotypic variance is scaled to unity, so $V_P = 1$. This implies:\n$$ V_A + V_C + V_E = 1 $$\n\nThe correlation in a trait between two members of a twin pair (denoted by subscripts $1$ and $2$) is defined as the ratio of their phenotypic covariance to the total phenotypic variance:\n$$ r = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2)}{V_P} $$\nSince $V_P = 1$, the correlation is simply equal to the covariance:\n$$ r = \\text{Cov}(P_1, P_2) = \\text{Cov}(A_1 + C_1 + E_1, A_2 + C_2 + E_2) $$\nExpanding the covariance and using the assumption that the $A$, $C$, and $E$ components are mutually uncorrelated, we get:\n$$ r = \\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) + \\text{Cov}(C_1, C_2) + \\text{Cov}(E_1, E_2) $$\n\nWe now apply this to monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins.\n\nFor **monozygotic (MZ) twins**, who are genetically identical, they share $100\\%$ of their alleles. Therefore, the covariance of their additive genetic effects is the total additive genetic variance:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = V_A $$\nBy definition of the shared environment, they share this component perfectly. Thus, the covariance of their shared environmental effects is the total shared environmental variance:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(C_1, C_2) = V_C $$\nThe unique environments are, by definition, uncorrelated between any two individuals, including twins.\n$$ \\text{Cov}(E_1, E_2) = 0 $$\nSumming these components gives the expected correlation for MZ twins:\n$$ r_{MZ} = V_A + V_C $$\n\nFor **dizygotic (DZ) twins**, who share on average $50\\%$ of their segregating alleles, the covariance of their additive genetic effects is half the additive genetic variance:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) = \\frac{1}{2} V_A $$\nUnder the Equal Environments Assumption (EEA), DZ twins are assumed to share their common environment to the same extent as MZ twins. Thus:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(C_1, C_2) = V_C $$\nTheir unique environments are also uncorrelated:\n$$ \\text{Cov}(E_1, E_2) = 0 $$\nSumming these components gives the expected correlation for DZ twins:\n$$ r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2} V_A + V_C $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Estimator for Narrow-Sense Heritability ($h^2$)**\n\nNarrow-sense heritability, $h^2$, is defined as the proportion of total phenotypic variance attributable to additive genetic variance:\n$$ h^2 = \\frac{V_A}{V_P} $$\nSince $V_P = 1$, we have $h^2 = V_A$. We can obtain an estimator for $V_A$ by solving the system of linear equations derived above:\n1. $r_{MZ} = V_A + V_C$\n2. $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2} V_A + V_C$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first eliminates $V_C$:\n$$ r_{MZ} - r_{DZ} = (V_A + V_C) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} V_A + V_C\\right) $$\n$$ r_{MZ} - r_{DZ} = V_A - \\frac{1}{2} V_A = \\frac{1}{2} V_A $$\nSolving for $V_A$ yields:\n$$ V_A = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}) $$\nTherefore, the estimator for narrow-sense heritability is:\n$$ h^2 = 2(r_{MZ} - r_{DZ}) $$\nThis is commonly known as Falconer's formula.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation of $h^2$**\n\nUsing the provided correlation values, $r_{MZ} = 0.68$ and $r_{DZ} = 0.44$:\n$$ h^2 = 2(0.68 - 0.44) = 2(0.24) = 0.48 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.4800$.\n\n**Part 4: Analysis of Identifiability of $V_C$ versus $V_D$**\n\nThe final part of the problem requires an analysis of the identifiability of shared environmental variance ($V_C$) versus dominance genetic variance ($V_D$) when only twin correlations are available. This necessitates comparing the standard ACE model with an alternative, the ADE model, which includes dominance effects but excludes shared environment.\n\nIn the ADE model, the phenotype is $P = A + D + E$, and the variance is $V_P = V_A + V_D + V_E = 1$. The correlations are derived from the covariances:\n- MZ twins share $100\\%$ of their additive effects and $100\\%$ of their dominance effects. Thus, $r_{MZ} = \\text{Cov}(A_1, A_2) + \\text{Cov}(D_1, D_2) = V_A + V_D$.\n- DZ twins share $50\\%$ of their additive effects. The probability that they share both alleles identical by descent at a given locus is $\\frac{1}{4}$, so their covariance for dominance effects is $\\frac{1}{4}V_D$. Thus, $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D$.\n\n**The issue of identifiability**: With only two observables ($r_{MZ}$ and $r_{DZ}$), we can at most uniquely solve for two unknown parameters. The ACE model estimates $V_A$ and $V_C$. The ADE model estimates $V_A$ and $V_D$. It is not possible to estimate $V_A$, $V_C$, and $V_D$ simultaneously from only MZ and DZ twin data; this is a classic confounding in the twin design. The parameters $V_C$ and $V_D$ are not identifiable in a full ACDE model.\n\n**Formalizing the condition**: We can, however, use the pattern of correlations to infer which model (ACE or ADE) provides a more plausible explanation for the data. This hinges on comparing $r_{DZ}$ to $\\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship for each model:\n\nCase 1: **ACE model**. We have $r_{MZ} = V_A + V_C$ and $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + V_C$.\nLet's express $r_{DZ}$ in terms of $r_{MZ}$:\nFrom the first equation, $V_A = r_{MZ} - V_C$.\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n$$ r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2}(r_{MZ} - V_C) + V_C = \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} - \\frac{1}{2}V_C + V_C = \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} + \\frac{1}{2}V_C $$\nSince variance must be non-negative ($V_C \\ge 0$), the ACE model implies:\n$$ r_{DZ} \\ge \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} $$\nSpecifically, if shared environmental effects contribute to resemblance ($V_C > 0$), then $r_{DZ}$ will be greater than half of $r_{MZ}$.\n\nCase 2: **ADE model**. We have $r_{MZ} = V_A + V_D$ and $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D$.\nLet's express $r_{DZ}$ in terms of $r_{MZ}$. A direct way is to compare $r_{DZ}$ with $\\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} = \\frac{1}{2}(V_A + V_D) = \\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{2}V_D $$\nNow, consider the difference:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} - r_{DZ} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{2}V_D\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}V_A + \\frac{1}{4}V_D\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}V_D $$\nSince dominance variance must be non-negative ($V_D \\ge 0$), the ADE model implies:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} - r_{DZ} \\ge 0 \\implies r_{DZ} \\le \\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} $$\nSpecifically, if dominance effects are present ($V_D > 0$), then $r_{DZ}$ will be less than half of $r_{MZ}$.\n\n**Conclusion of the analysis**: The condition that distinguishes the influence of shared environment from that of genetic dominance is the comparison of $r_{DZ}$ to $\\frac{1}{2} r_{MZ}$.\n- If $r_{DZ} > \\frac{1}{2} r_{MZ}$, the pattern of twin resemblance is indicative of shared environmental effects ($V_C$).\n- If $r_{DZ} < \\frac{1}{2} r_{MZ}$, the pattern is indicative of dominance genetic effects ($V_D$).\n- If $r_{DZ} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{MZ}$, the data are consistent with a simple AE model, where neither $V_C$ nor $V_D$ is a significant factor.\n\nFor the data provided ($r_{MZ} = 0.68$, $r_{DZ} = 0.44$), we have $\\frac{1}{2}r_{MZ} = \\frac{1}{2}(0.68) = 0.34$. Since $r_{DZ} = 0.44 > 0.34$, the data strongly suggest the presence of shared environmental effects, warranting the use of the ACE model over the ADE model.",

Alleles at nearby loci are often inherited together, creating statistical associations known as linkage disequilibrium (LD). This exercise provides a foundational understanding of LD by asking you to compute its key measures, $D$ and $r^2$, directly from haplotype data and derive the classic model of its decay due to recombination over generations . A firm grasp of LD is essential for interpreting association studies and understanding the structure of the human genome.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in theoretical population genetics, with all necessary data and definitions provided. We proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. First, we compute the sample haplotype and allele frequencies from the provided counts, and then use these to calculate the linkage disequilibrium coefficient $D$. Second, we derive the squared correlation coefficient $r^2$ and compute its numerical value. Third, we derive the expected linkage disequilibrium after $t$ generations, $D_t$, as a function of the initial disequilibrium and the recombination rate $c$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Frequencies and the Linkage Disequilibrium Coefficient $D$**\n\nThe total number of sampled haplotypes is $N$. The given counts are $n_{AB} = 210$, $n_{Ab} = 90$, $n_{aB} = 70$, and $n_{ab} = 130$.\n$$N = n_{AB} + n_{Ab} + n_{aB} + n_{ab} = 210 + 90 + 70 + 130 = 500$$\nThe sample haplotype frequencies ($p_{uv}$) are estimated as the observed counts divided by the total sample size:\n$$p_{AB} = \\frac{n_{AB}}{N} = \\frac{210}{500} = 0.42$$\n$$p_{Ab} = \\frac{n_{Ab}}{N} = \\frac{90}{500} = 0.18$$\n$$p_{aB} = \\frac{n_{aB}}{N} = \\frac{70}{500} = 0.14$$\n$$p_{ab} = \\frac{n_{ab}}{N} = \\frac{130}{500} = 0.26$$\nThe sum of these frequencies is $0.42 + 0.18 + 0.14 + 0.26 = 1.00$, as required.\n\nThe marginal allele frequencies for alleles $A$ ($p_A$) and $B$ ($p_B$) are calculated by summing the frequencies of the haplotypes that carry them:\n$$p_A = P(X=1) = p_{AB} + p_{Ab} = 0.42 + 0.18 = 0.60$$\n$$p_B = P(Y=1) = p_{AB} + p_{aB} = 0.42 + 0.14 = 0.56$$\nThe frequencies for the alternative alleles, $a$ and $b$, are:\n$$p_a = P(X=0) = 1 - p_A = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$$\n$$p_b = P(Y=0) = 1 - p_B = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44$$\n\nThe linkage disequilibrium coefficient $D$ is defined as the covariance of the indicator random variables $X$ and $Y$, $D = \\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y)$. By definition, covariance is $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y]$.\nFor the indicator variable $X$, its expectation is $E[X] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X=0) = P(X=1) = p_A$.\nSimilarly, for the indicator variable $Y$, $E[Y] = p_B$.\nThe product $XY$ is also an indicator variable. It is equal to $1$ if and only if $X=1$ and $Y=1$, which corresponds to an individual carrying the $AB$ haplotype. Thus, its expectation is $E[XY] = 1 \\cdot P(X=1, Y=1) + 0 \\cdot P(\\text{not } (X=1,Y=1)) = P(X=1, Y=1) = p_{AB}$.\nSubstituting these expectations into the covariance formula gives the standard expression for $D$:\n$$D = p_{AB} - p_A p_B$$\nUsing the calculated frequency values:\n$$D = 0.42 - (0.60)(0.56) = 0.42 - 0.336 = 0.084$$\nRounded to four significant figures, the initial linkage disequilibrium, which we will denote $D_0$, is $0.08400$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation and Calculation of the Squared Correlation $r^2$**\n\nThe squared correlation coefficient $r^2$ between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y))^2}{\\operatorname{Var}(X)\\operatorname{Var}(Y)}$$\nFrom Part 1, we have $\\operatorname{Cov}(X,Y) = D$.\nNext, we must find the variances of the indicator variables $X$ and $Y$. For a Bernoulli random variable like $X$, the variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. Since $X$ only takes values $0$ and $1$, $X^2 = X$. Therefore, $E[X^2]=E[X]=p_A$.\nThe variance of $X$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(X) = E[X] - (E[X])^2 = p_A - (p_A)^2 = p_A(1 - p_A)$$\nSimilarly, the variance of $Y$ is:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(Y) = p_B(1 - p_B)$$\nSubstituting the covariance and variances into the formula for $r^2$ gives the desired expression in terms of $D$, $p_A$, and $p_B$:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{D^2}{p_A(1-p_A)p_B(1-p_B)}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value using our computed parameters:\n$$r^2 = \\frac{(0.084)^2}{(0.60)(1-0.60)(0.56)(1-0.56)} = \\frac{0.007056}{(0.60)(0.40)(0.56)(0.44)}$$\n$$r^2 = \\frac{0.007056}{(0.24)(0.2464)} = \\frac{0.007056}{0.059136} \\approx 0.119317...$$\nRounded to four significant figures, $r^2$ is $0.1193$.\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Decay of Linkage Disequilibrium over Generations**\n\nWe aim to find an expression for $D_t$, the LD coefficient at generation $t$, as a function of the initial LD, $D_0$, and the recombination rate, $c$. The allele frequencies $p_A$ and $p_B$ are constant over time under the given model assumptions (random mating without selection, mutation, or migration).\n\nLet $p_{AB}^{(t)}$ be the frequency of the $AB$ haplotype at generation $t$. The LD at generation $t$ is $D_t = p_{AB}^{(t)} - p_A p_B$. To find the general form of $D_t$, we must first establish a recurrence relation for $p_{AB}^{(t)}$.\nThe frequency of the $AB$ haplotype in the next generation, $p_{AB}^{(t+1)}$, is determined by the frequencies in generation $t$ and the recombination rate $c$. We use the law of total probability. An $AB$ gamete in generation $t+1$ can be formed in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  It is a non-recombinant gamete. This occurs with probability $1-c$. For this to produce an $AB$ gamete, the parent chromosome must have been an $AB$ haplotype. The frequency of such chromosomes in the gene pool of generation $t$ is $p_{AB}^{(t)}$.\n2.  It is a recombinant gamete. This occurs with probability $c$. For this to produce an $AB$ gamete, the parental genotype must have provided an $A$ allele from one chromosome and a $B$ allele from the homologous chromosome. In a randomly mating population, the probability of drawing these alleles is simply the product of their frequencies, $p_A p_B$.\n\nCombining these possibilities, we obtain the recurrence relation for the haplotype frequency:\n$$p_{AB}^{(t+1)} = (1-c)p_{AB}^{(t)} + c p_A p_B$$\nNow, we express this in terms of the LD coefficient. By definition, $p_{AB}^{(t)} = D_t + p_A p_B$ and $p_{AB}^{(t+1)} = D_{t+1} + p_A p_B$. Substituting these into the recurrence relation:\n$$D_{t+1} + p_A p_B = (1-c)(D_t + p_A p_B) + c p_A p_B$$\nExpanding the right-hand side:\n$$D_{t+1} + p_A p_B = (1-c)D_t + (1-c)p_A p_B + c p_A p_B$$\n$$D_{t+1} + p_A p_B = (1-c)D_t + p_A p_B$$\nSubtracting $p_A p_B$ from both sides gives the recurrence relation for $D_t$:\n$$D_{t+1} = (1-c)D_t$$\nThis is a simple geometric progression. Starting from an initial disequilibrium $D_0$ at generation $t=0$, we can unroll the recurrence:\n$$D_1 = (1-c)D_0$$\n$$D_2 = (1-c)D_1 = (1-c)^2 D_0$$\nBy induction, the solution for any generation $t$ is:\n$$D_t = (1-c)^t D_0$$\nThe problem asks for this expression with the numerical value of the initial LD coefficient, $D_0$, which we calculated to be $0.084$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.08400$. Thus, the final expression is:\n$$D_t = 0.08400(1-c)^t$$\nThis equation describes the exponential decay of linkage disequilibrium over time due to recombination.",

The probability of being affected is the probability that $L > T$, which is $P(L > 0.6)$.\n\nTo calculate this probability, we standardize the random variable $L$ to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, where $Z = \\frac{L - \\mu_L}{\\sigma_L}$.\n$$P(L > 0.6) = P\\left(\\frac{L - 1.2}{0.6} > \\frac{0.6 - 1.2}{0.6}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $Z$ for the standardized term, we get:\n$$P\\left(Z > \\frac{-0.6}{0.6}\\right) = P(Z > -1)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, which gives the probability $P(Z \\le z)$. The probability $P(Z > -1)$ can be expressed as:\n$$P(Z > -1) = 1 - P(Z \\le -1) = 1 - \\Phi(-1)$$\nUsing the symmetry property of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$, we can rewrite the expression:\n$$1 - \\Phi(-1) = 1 - (1 - \\Phi(1)) = \\Phi(1)$$\nThus, the required probability is the value of the standard normal CDF evaluated at $z=1$. From standard statistical tables or computation, the value is:\n$$\\Phi(1) \\approx 0.8413447...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding the value gives:\n$$0.8413$$\nThis is the expected probability that the individual is affected, conditional on carrying the specified allele and having the given polygenic score.",
