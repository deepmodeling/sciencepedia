            "problem": "In the systems biology of neurodegeneration, the spatial spread of a misfolded protein species along a long axon can be modeled as a one-dimensional medium with local autocatalytic conversion and effective dispersal. Let $u(x,t)$ denote the linear concentration of the misfolded species along a single axon at position $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and time $t \\geq 0$.

Express the final answer solely in terms of $D$ and $r$, and do not include any physical units. Your final answer should be the analytical expression for $c^{\\ast}$ only.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal admissible wavefront speed, $c^{\\ast}$, for a traveling front solution to the Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovsky–Piskunov (Fisher–KPP) equation.\n\nThe governing equation is given as:\n$$\nu_{t} = D u_{xx} + r u \\left(1 - \\frac{u}{K}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the concentration, $D > 0$ is the diffusion coefficient, $r > 0$ is the growth rate, and $K > 0$ is the carrying capacity.\n\nWe seek a traveling wave solution of the form $u(x,t) = U(z)$, where $z = x - ct$ is the moving coordinate. The constant $c > 0$ is the speed of the wave. We need to transform the partial differential equation (PDE) for $u(x,t)$ into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the wave profile $U(z)$. The partial derivatives are transformed as follows:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{dU}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -c U'(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\frac{dU}{dz} \\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x} = U'(z)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{d^2 U}{dz^2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial x}\\right)^2 = U''(z)\n$$\nsubstituting these into the PDE gives the ODE for the wave profile $U(z)$:\n$$\n-c U'(z) = D U''(z) + r U(z) \\left(1 - \\frac{U(z)}{K}\\right)\n$$\nwhich can be rearranged to:\n$$\nD U'' + c U' + r U \\left(1 - \\frac{U}{K}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies the boundary conditions for the traveling front:\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to -\\infty} U(z) = K \\quad (\\text{stable state, behind the front})\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{z \\to +\\infty} U(z) = 0 \\quad (\\text{unstable state, ahead of the front})\n$$\nThe derivation is to be based on the analysis of the equation at the leading edge of the front, which corresponds to the region where $z \\to +\\infty$. In this region, the concentration $U(z)$ is very small, approaching $0$. We can therefore linearize the ODE around the unstable equilibrium point $U = 0$. For $U \\ll K$, the nonlinear term $r U^2 / K$ is negligible compared to the linear term $r U$. The ODE simplifies to its linearized form:\n$$\nD U'' + c U' + r U = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We look for solutions of the form $U(z) = A e^{\\lambda z}$ for some constants $A$ and $\\lambda$. Substituting this ansatz into the linearized ODE yields the characteristic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$\nD (A \\lambda^2 e^{\\lambda z}) + c (A \\lambda e^{\\lambda z}) + r (A e^{\\lambda z}) = 0\n$$\nDividing by $A e^{\\lambda z}$ (which is non-zero), we obtain:\n$$\nD \\lambda^2 + c \\lambda + r = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation are given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4Dr}}{2D}\n$$\nThe general solution to the linearized ODE is a linear combination of the exponential functions corresponding to these two roots. For the boundary condition $\\lim_{z \\to +\\infty} U(z) = 0$ to be satisfied, the real part of $\\lambda$ must be negative.\n\nLet's analyze the nature of the roots based on the discriminant $\\Delta = c^2 - 4Dr$.\n\nCase 1: $\\Delta < 0$, or $c^2 < 4Dr$.\nIn this case, the roots for $\\lambda$ are a complex conjugate pair:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{c}{2D} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{4Dr - c^2}}{2D}\n$$\nThe real part of both roots is $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) = -c/(2D)$, which is negative since $c>0$ and $D>0$. The general solution for $U(z)$ in this regime takes the form:\n$$\nU(z) \\approx e^{-cz/(2D)} \\left( C_1 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4Dr - c^2}}{2D}z\\right) + C_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{4Dr - c^2}}{2D}z\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThis solution decays to zero as $z \\to +\\infty$, but it is oscillatory. An oscillating solution will inevitably take on negative values. Since $u(x,t)$ represents a physical concentration, it must be non-negative, $u \\ge 0$. Furthermore, the problem specifies a *monotone* traveling front, which cannot have oscillations. Therefore, speeds $c$ for which $c^2 < 4Dr$ are not admissible for forming a non-negative, monotone front.\n\nCase 2: $\\Delta \\ge 0$, or $c^2 \\ge 4Dr$.\nIn this case, the roots for $\\lambda$ are real.\n$$\n\\lambda_{1,2} = \\frac{-c \\pm \\sqrt{c^2 - 4Dr}}{2D}\n$$\nSince $c > 0$, $D > 0$, $r > 0$, we have $c^2 > c^2 - 4Dr$ (for $Dr > 0$). Thus, $\\sqrt{c^2 - 4Dr} < c$. It follows that both roots $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are real and negative. The solution at the leading edge is of the form:\n$$\nU(z) \\approx C_1 e^{\\lambda_1 z} + C_2 e^{\\lambda_2 z}\n$$\nThis solution decays monotonically to zero as $z \\to +\\infty$, which is consistent with the physical requirements of a non-negative concentration and a monotone front profile.\n\nFrom this analysis, the condition for the existence of a physically plausible, non-oscillatory front invading the unstable state $U=0$ is that the speed $c$ must satisfy:\n$$\nc^2 \\ge 4Dr\n$$\nSince the speed $c$ must be positive, this implies:\n$$\nc \\ge \\sqrt{4Dr} = 2\\sqrt{Dr}\n$$\nThis inequality defines the continuum of all possible speeds for which monotone traveling fronts can exist. The problem asks for the minimal admissible wavefront speed, which is the minimum value in this allowed range. This minimal speed, denoted $c^{\\ast}$, is obtained when the inequality becomes an equality:\n$$\nc^{\\ast} = 2\\sqrt{Dr}\n$$\nThis specific speed is the one selected by fronts that develop from localized initial conditions, a well-known result for the Fisher-KPP equation.",

The non-zero contributions at $t=0$ are:\n$k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_{c}-1} \\frac{d^2 m}{dt^2}(0)$ from the first term.\n$k_{2} m_0^{n_2} \\frac{d^2 M}{dt^2}(0)$ from the third term.\nSo, $\\frac{d^3 P}{dt^3}(0) = k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_{c}-1} \\frac{d^2m}{dt^2}(0) + k_{2} m_0^{n_2} \\frac{d^2M}{dt^2}(0)$.\nUsing $\\frac{d^2m}{dt^2}(0) = -y''(0)$ and $\\frac{d^2M}{dt^2}(0) = y''(0)$, we have:\n$\\frac{d^3 P}{dt^3}(0) = -k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_{c}-1} y''(0) + k_{2} m_0^{n_2} y''(0) = y''(0) [k_{2} m_0^{n_2} - k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_c-1}]$.\nNow substitute into the expression for $y^{(4)}(0)$:\n$y^{(4)}(0) = 2 k_{+} [3(-y''(0)) (k_{n} m_{0}^{n_{c}}) + m_{0} (y''(0) [k_{2} m_0^{n_2} - k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_c-1}])]$.\nFactor out $y''(0)$:\n$y^{(4)}(0) = 2 k_{+} y''(0) [-3 k_{n} m_{0}^{n_{c}} + m_{0}(k_{2} m_0^{n_2} - k_{n} n_{c} m_0^{n_c-1})]$.\n$y^{(4)}(0) = 2 k_{+} y''(0) [-3 k_{n} m_{0}^{n_{c}} + k_{2} m_0^{n_2+1} - k_{n} n_{c} m_{0}^{n_{c}}]$.\n$$y^{(4)}(0) = 2 k_{+} y^{(2)}(0) [k_{2} m_0^{n_2+1} - (n_c+3) k_{n} m_{0}^{n_c}]$$\n\nWe have two equations relating the observables ($y^{(2)}(0)$, $y^{(4)}(0)$) to the three parameters ($k_{+}, k_{n}, k_{2}$):\n(A) $y^{(2)}(0) = 2 (k_{+}k_{n}) m_0^{n_c+1}$\n(B) $y^{(4)}(0) = 2 k_{+} y^{(2)}(0) [k_{2} m_0^{n_2+1} - (n_c+3) k_{n} m_{0}^{n_c}]$\n\nFrom (A), we can identify the product combination $\\lambda_{1} = k_{+}k_{n} = \\frac{y^{(2)}(0)}{2 m_0^{n_c+1}}$.\nSubstitute $2 k_{+} = \\frac{y^{(2)}(0)}{k_{n} m_0^{n_c+1}}$ from (A) into (B):\n$y^{(4)}(0) = \\frac{y^{(2)}(0)}{k_{n} m_0^{n_c+1}} y^{(2)}(0) [k_{2} m_0^{n_2+1} - (n_c+3) k_{n} m_{0}^{n_c}]$.\n$y^{(4)}(0) = \\frac{(y^{(2)}(0))^2}{k_{n} m_0^{n_c+1}} [k_{2} m_0^{n_2+1} - (n_c+3) k_{n} m_{0}^{n_c}]$.\n$y^{(4)}(0) = (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\left( \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} \\right) \\frac{m_0^{n_2+1}}{m_0^{n_c+1}} - (y^{(2)}(0))^2 (n_c+3) \\frac{m_0^{n_c}}{m_0^{n_c+1}}$.\n$y^{(4)}(0) = (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\left( \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} \\right) m_0^{n_2-n_c} - (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\frac{n_c+3}{m_0}$.\n\nThis equation can be solved for the ratio $\\lambda_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}}$.\nThis means we have two independent algebraic constraints for three unknown parameters. Therefore, the parameters $k_{+}$, $k_{n}$, and $k_{2}$ are not individually structurally identifiable. However, the combinations $\\lambda_{1} = k_{+}k_{n}$ and $\\lambda_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}}$ (and consequently $\\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 = k_+ k_2$) are structurally identifiable.\n\n### Part 3: Explicit Expression for the Identifiable Combination\n\nFrom the final equation in Part 2, we solve for the ratio $\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}}$.\n$y^{(4)}(0) + (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\frac{n_c+3}{m_0} = (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\left( \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} \\right) m_0^{n_2-n_c}$.\n$\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} = \\frac{y^{(4)}(0) + (y^{(2)}(0))^2 \\frac{n_c+3}{m_0}}{(y^{(2)}(0))^2 m_0^{n_2-n_c}}$.\nTo eliminate the fraction in the numerator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $m_0$:\n$\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} = \\frac{m_0 y^{(4)}(0) + (n_c+3)(y^{(2)}(0))^2}{m_0 (y^{(2)}(0))^2 m_0^{n_2-n_c}}$.\n$\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{n}} = \\frac{m_0 y^{(4)}(0) + (n_c+3)(y^{(2)}(0))^2}{(y^{(2)}(0))^2 m_0^{n_2-n_c+1}}$.\n\nThis is the explicit closed-form analytic expression for the identifiable parameter combination $\\frac{k_2}{k_n}$ in terms of measurable initial derivatives of the output and known constants.",
