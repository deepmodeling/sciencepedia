            "problem": "In structural brain connectome analysis, diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) tractography yields streamline counts between brain parcels that serve as a proxy for white-matter pathway strength. A common confound is that larger parcels tend to accumulate more streamlines purely by virtue of size, even when the underlying microstructural connectivity per unit tissue is comparable. Suppose parcels indexed by $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ have volumes $v_{1}=2\\,\\text{cm}^{3}$, $v_{2}=3\\,\\text{cm}^{3}$, $v_{3}=2\\,\\text{cm}^{3}$, and $v_{4}=4\\,\\text{cm}^{3}$, and the undirected streamline counts obtained from dMRI tractography are given for the pairs $\\{(1,2):50,(1,3):10,(2,4):20,(3,4):5\\}$, with all other pairs having zero counts. Assume parcels are non-overlapping and that the expected streamline count between parcels scales linearly with the total tissue volume involved. Based on this linear scaling assumption, define a volume-normalized adjacency weight $A_{ij}$ that removes the size bias by dividing the raw count by an appropriate function of parcel volumes, and compute the normalized weights for the nonzero edges. Then, treating the connectome as an undirected weighted graph with $n=4$ parcels, define the weighted global density $D_{w}$ as the arithmetic mean of the normalized weights over all unordered parcel pairs,\n$$\nD_{w}=\\frac{2}{n(n-1)}\\sum_{i<j}A_{ij},\n$$\nand evaluate $D_{w}$ for this dataset.\n\nProvide the final numerical value of $D_{w}$ exactly (do not round).

            "solution": "First, we must define the volume-normalized adjacency weight, $A_{ij}$. The problem states that the expected streamline count, $C_{ij}$, scales linearly with the \"total tissue volume involved\". For a connection between two parcels $i$ and $j$, the total volume involved is the sum of their individual volumes, $v_i + v_j$. To remove this scaling bias, we must divide the raw count by this quantity. Therefore, the normalized weight is defined as:\n$$\nA_{ij} = \\frac{C_{ij}}{v_i + v_j}\n$$\nThe units of $A_{ij}$ are counts per unit volume, consistent with the problem's request to express the final density in counts per $\\text{cm}^3$.\n\nNext, we calculate the normalized weights for all unordered pairs of parcels $(i,j)$ with $i<j$.

Two independent cohorts are studied: group $\\mathcal{G}_A$ with $n_A = 10$ subjects and group $\\mathcal{G}_B$ with $n_B = 10$ subjects. The connectome comprises $p = 4$ cortical regions labeled $R_1, R_2, R_3, R_4$, yielding $m = \\binom{4}{2} = 6$ undirected edges: $(R_1,R_2)$, $(R_1,R_3)$, $(R_1,R_4)$, $(R_2,R_3)$, $(R_2,R_4)$, $(R_3,R_4)$.\n\nFor each edge $e$, define the group mean difference of Fisher $z$-transformed connectivity as $d_e = \\bar{z}_A(e) - \\bar{z}_B(e)$, where $\\bar{z}_A(e)$ and $\\bar{z}_B(e)$ are the across-subject means in $\\mathcal{G}_A$ and $\\mathcal{G}_B$, respectively.

If you perform any rounding, round to four significant figures and state the rounding step explicitly; otherwise, report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The solution involves three main parts: 1. derivation of the permutation test $p$-value, 2. derivation of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) False Discovery Rate (FDR) adjustment, and 3. calculation of the specific BH-adjusted $q$-value for edge $(R_2, R_4)$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Permutation Test $p$-value**\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, posits that there is no true difference between group $\\mathcal{G}_A$ and group $\\mathcal{G}_B$, meaning the subject labels are exchangeable. Under $H_0$, the observed test statistic, $d_e = \\bar{z}_A(e) - \\bar{z}_B(e)$, for any edge $e$, is simply one realization from the distribution of all possible test statistics that would be obtained by permuting the group labels among the $n_A + n_B = 20$ subjects.\n\nA permutation test approximates this full permutation distribution by generating a large number of random permutations. Here, $N_{\\text{perm}} = 999$ random permutations of the group labels are generated. For each permutation $\\pi$, a new test statistic $d_e^{(\\pi)}$ is computed.\n\nThe empirical null distribution for edge $e$ is formed by the collection of these permuted statistics along with the original, observed statistic. The total size of this reference set is $N_{\\text{perm}} + 1$.\n\nThe $p$-value is defined as the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the one actually observed, assuming $H_0$ is true. For a two-sided test, \"extremity\" is measured by the absolute value of the statistic. The observed statistic is $d_e$, and its extremity is $|d_e|$. The permuted statistics are $d_e^{(\\pi)}$, with extremities $|d_e^{(\\pi)}|$.\n\nThe problem provides $b_e$, the number of permutations where the permuted statistic was at least as extreme as the observed one:\n$$b_e = \\sum_{\\pi=1}^{N_{\\text{perm}}} \\mathbb{I}(|d_e^{(\\pi)}| \\ge |d_e|)$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n\nTo calculate the $p$-value, we count how many elements in the empirical null distribution (of size $N_{\\text{perm}} + 1$) are as or more extreme than the observed statistic. This count includes the $b_e$ permutations and the observed statistic itself, as $|d_e| \\ge |d_e|$ is always true. Thus, the total count of equally or more extreme values is $b_e + 1$.\n\nThe empirical $p$-value is the ratio of this count to the total number of elements in the reference distribution. Therefore, the exact form of the permutation test $p$-value for edge $e$ is:\n$$p_e = \\frac{b_e + 1}{N_{\\text{perm}} + 1}$$\nThis formulation, including the $+1$ in both the numerator and denominator, is standard practice to ensure the $p$-value is well-behaved, bounded between $\\frac{1}{N_{\\text{perm}}+1}$ and $1$, and avoids a $p$-value of $0$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) FDR Procedure**\n\nWhen performing multiple hypothesis tests, as is the case here with $m=6$ edges, we must correct for the increased probability of making a Type I error. The False Discovery Rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of false discoveries (erroneously rejected null hypotheses, or Type I errors) among all discoveries (all rejected null hypotheses). Let $V$ be the number of false discoveries and $R$ be the total number of discoveries. The False Discovery Proportion is $FDP = V/R$ (defined as $0$ if $R=0$), and $FDR = E[FDP]$.\n\nThe Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure provides control over the FDR at a specified level $\\alpha$. The \"step-up\" procedure works as follows:\n1.  Given a set of $m$ $p$-values, $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_m\\}$, sort them in ascending order: $p_{(1)} \\le p_{(2)} \\le \\ldots \\le p_{(m)}$. Let $H_{(i)}$ be the null hypothesis corresponding to the $p$-value $p_{(i)}$.\n2.  To control FDR at level $\\alpha$, find the largest index $k$ such that $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m} \\alpha$.\n3.  Reject all null hypotheses $H_{(i)}$ for $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, k$.\n\nThe BH-adjusted $p$-value, often called a $q$-value, for a specific test is defined as the lowest FDR level $\\alpha$ at which that test's null hypothesis would be rejected. From the procedure above, the hypothesis $H_{(i)}$ is rejected if $p_{(i)} \\le \\frac{i}{m} \\alpha$, or equivalently, if $\\alpha \\ge p_{(i)} \\frac{m}{i}$. To satisfy this condition for all rejected hypotheses up to rank $k$, we must have $\\alpha \\ge p_{(j)}\\frac{m}{j}$ for all $j \\le k$. The BH procedure rejects all $H_{(1)}, \\dots, H_{(k)}$, so the critical $\\alpha$ is determined by the \"loosest\" condition, which is at rank $k$. However, the definition of the $q$-value must ensure monotonicity, i.e., $p_{(i)} \\le p_{(j)} \\implies q_{(i)} \\le q_{(j)}$.\n\nThe $q$-value for the $i$-th ordered $p$-value, $q_{(i)}$, is derived from the step-up logic. The condition for rejecting $H_{(i)}$ and all preceding hypotheses is that for some $k \\ge i$, $p_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}\\alpha$. The minimum $\\alpha$ for which this holds for a fixed $p_{(i)}$ is effectively $\\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\{p_{(j)}\\frac{m}{j}\\}$.\nTherefore, the $q$-values for the sorted $p$-values are computed as follows:\n-   Start with the largest $p$-value, $p_{(m)}$. Its adjusted value is $q_{(m)} = p_{(m)}\\frac{m}{m} = p_{(m)}$.\n-   Proceed downwards for $i = m-1, \\ldots, 1$. The $q$-value for $p_{(i)}$ is given by:\n    $$q_{(i)} = \\min\\left(q_{(i+1)}, p_{(i)}\\frac{m}{i}\\right)$$\nThis recursive definition is equivalent to the direct form:\n$$q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( p_{(j)} \\frac{m}{j} \\right)$$\nThe final set of $q$-values $\\{q_{(1)}, q_{(2)}, \\ldots, q_{(m)}\\}$ is then re-associated with their original, unsorted hypotheses.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the $q$-value for edge $(R_2, R_4)$**\n\nFirst, we compute the uncorrected $p$-value for each of the $m=6$ edges using the derived formula $p_e = \\frac{b_e + 1}{N_{\\text{perm}} + 1}$ with $N_{\\text{perm}} = 999$.\n-   $p_{12} = \\frac{3+1}{999+1} = \\frac{4}{1000} = 0.004$\n-   $p_{13} = \\frac{20+1}{1000} = \\frac{21}{1000} = 0.021$\n-   $p_{14} = \\frac{0+1}{1000} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$\n-   $p_{23} = \\frac{8+1}{1000} = \\frac{9}{1000} = 0.009$\n-   $p_{24} = \\frac{31+1}{1000} = \\frac{32}{1000} = 0.032$\n-   $p_{34} = \\frac{17+1}{1000} = \\frac{18}{1000} = 0.018$\n\nNext, we sort these $p$-values in ascending order:\n-   $p_{(1)} = 0.001$ (from edge $(R_1,R_4)$)\n-   $p_{(2)} = 0.004$ (from edge $(R_1,R_2)$)\n-   $p_{(3)} = 0.009$ (from edge $(R_2,R_3)$)\n-   $p_{(4)} = 0.018$ (from edge $(R_3,R_4)$)\n-   $p_{(5)} = 0.021$ (from edge $(R_1,R_3)$)\n-   $p_{(6)} = 0.032$ (from edge $(R_2,R_4)$)\n\nWe are asked to find the $q$-value for the edge $(R_2, R_4)$. Its uncorrected $p$-value is $p_{24}=0.032$, which is the largest of all $p$-values, corresponding to rank $i=6$ in the sorted list.\n\nUsing the derived BH procedure, we compute the $q$-value for this ranked $p$-value, $q_{(6)}$.\nAccording to the formula, the $q$-value for the largest $p$-value ($i=m$) is simply the $p$-value itself:\n$$q_{(m)} = p_{(m)}$$\nIn our case, $m=6$, so we need to compute $q_{(6)}$:\n$$q_{(6)} = p_{(6)} = 0.032$$\nThis can also be seen from the general formula $q_{(i)} = \\min_{j=i, \\dots, m} \\left( p_{(j)} \\frac{m}{j} \\right)$. For $i=6$, the set of indices $j$ is just $\\{6\\}$, so:\n$$q_{(6)} = p_{(6)} \\frac{m}{6} = p_{(6)} \\frac{6}{6} = p_{(6)} = 0.032$$\nThe value is an exact decimal and does not require rounding. The Benjamini-Hochberg $q$-value for the edge $(R_2, R_4)$ is $0.032$.",

Atomoxetine increases the global synaptic gain $g$ via noradrenergic neuromodulation, thereby strengthening effective coupling across an unchanged $\\mathbf{S}$, which raises the off-diagonal entries of $\\mathbf{C}$ and the correlation $\\rho_{ij}$, provided $\\rho(g\\,\\mathbf{S}) < \\alpha$ remains satisfied.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes that the change is due to an increase in $g$. According to our derived formula, $\\rho_{ij} = \\frac{gs}{\\alpha}$, if $s$ and $\\alpha$ are constant, an increase in $g$ will directly cause a proportional increase in $\\rho_{ij}$. This perfectly matches the observation. Atomoxetine is a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, and a primary hypothesized mechanism of noradrenergic neuromodulation is the tuning of network or synaptic gain, which is precisely what the parameter $g$ represents. The stability condition $gs < \\alpha$ is equivalent to $\\rho_{ij} < 1$, which is satisfied for both $\\rho_{ij}^{(1)} = 0.30$ and $\\rho_{ij}^{(2)} = 0.50$. This explanation is fully consistent with the model, the data, and the known pharmacology.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The increase in FC reflects rapid microstructural changes (acute axonal sprouting) that increase $s$ in $\\mathbf{S}_{(ij)}$, but DWI tractography fails to detect these changes due to limited sensitivity over short time scales of tens of minutes.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option suggests that the underlying SC, represented by $s$, has actually changed. This contradicts a premise of the problem, which states that \"structural connectivity (SC) between $i$ and $j$ remains statistically indistinguishable\". While the critique of DWI sensitivity might be valid in a real-world context, a valid solution must operate within the given premises. This option invalidates one of the core constraints.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The FC increase is driven by a larger independent noise variance $\\sigma^{2}$ at each node under atomoxetine; higher $\\sigma^{2}$ inflates $\\rho_{ij}$ even if $\\alpha$, $g$, and $\\mathbf{S}$ are unchanged.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option proposes that an increase in noise variance $\\sigma^2$ is the cause. Our derivation shows that $\\rho_{ij} = \\frac{gs}{\\alpha}$. The correlation coefficient is independent of $\\sigma^2$. While the variance ($C_{ii}$) and covariance ($C_{ij}$) both increase with $\\sigma^2$, their ratio, the correlation, remains constant. Therefore, this explanation is mathematically inconsistent with the provided model.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Atomoxetine primarily alters vascular reactivity, changing the hemodynamic response and increasing BOLD correlations without neural coupling changes; thus the FC increase is hemodynamic in origin despite the breath-hold calibration indicating time-invariant hemodynamics across sessions.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This option posits a non-neural, purely hemodynamic cause for the observed change in FC. This directly contradicts a key assumption of the problem: \"the hemodynamic response function is time-invariant across sessions\". The question explicitly asks for an explanation consistent with the modeling assumptions, and this option rejects a crucial one. It posits that the link between neural activity and the BOLD signal is what changes, whereas the problem asks for an explanation at the neural level, assuming a stable neural-to-BOLD mapping.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",
