For vascularized models, a critical parameter is the wall shear stress ($τ_w$) exerted by flowing fluid on endothelial cells, which directly influences their structure and function. This practice  challenges you to derive the relationship between flow rate and shear stress from fundamental principles of fluid dynamics, providing a vital tool for designing and operating microfluidic systems that accurately mimic in vivo conditions.",

            "problem": "A microfluidic Organ-on-Chip (OoC) platform is designed with a single, straight rectangular channel of width $w$, height $h$, and length $L$, lined with endothelial cells (ECs). A Newtonian, incompressible culture medium with dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ flows steadily through the channel at a constant volumetric flow rate $Q$. The geometry satisfies $w \\gg h$, and the flow is fully developed, laminar, and driven by a constant axial pressure gradient. The no-slip boundary condition holds at the walls. \n\nStarting from the governing principles for Newtonian viscous flow and continuity, specifically the steady, fully developed, incompressible balance between viscous diffusion and pressure gradient in a parallel-plate approximation, derive an expression for the wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$ at the channel walls in terms of $\\mu$, $Q$, $w$, and $h$. Then, evaluate $\\tau_{w}$ for the following experimentally realistic parameters: $\\mu = 1$ mPa·s, $Q = 1$ mL/min, $w = 1$ mm, and $h = 150$ $\\mu$m. In your numerical evaluation, use $1$ mPa·s $= 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ Pa·s, $1$ mL $= 1 \\times 10^{-6}$ m$^{3}$, $1$ mm $= 1 \\times 10^{-3}$ m, and $1$ $\\mu$m $= 1 \\times 10^{-6}$ m. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in Pascals. \n\nFinally, briefly comment on the relevance of the computed $\\tau_{w}$ for endothelial alignment in vitro on OoC platforms, referencing typical ranges known to promote EC alignment, but do not include this commentary in your final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The assumptions of steady, fully developed, laminar, incompressible flow in a high-aspect-ratio channel ($w \\gg h$) are consistent and allow for a simplified analysis using the plane Poiseuille flow model. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a microfluidics experiment.\n\nThe governing equation for steady, fully developed, incompressible viscous flow in a channel, where the flow is in the $x$-direction, is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. With velocity $\\mathbf{u} = (u(y,z), 0, 0)$, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to:\n$$0 = -\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2} \\right)$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and the coordinates are $y$ across the height and $z$ across the width. The pressure gradient, $\\frac{dp}{dx}$, is constant for fully developed flow.\n\nThe problem specifies a geometry where the width $w$ is much greater than the height $h$ ($w \\gg h$). This allows us to use the parallel-plate approximation, which assumes that the velocity gradients across the width, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2}$, are negligible compared to those across the height, $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$, for the majority of the flow field away from the short side walls. The governing equation thus reduces to an ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nWe set up the coordinate system with $y=0$ at the bottom wall and $y=h$ at the top wall. The no-slip boundary conditions are $u(0) = 0$ and $u(h) = 0$.\n\nIntegrating the equation twice with respect to $y$ yields:\n$$\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1$$\n$$u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2$$\nApplying the boundary conditions to find the integration constants $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n$u(0) = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$.\n$u(h) = 0 \\implies 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} h^2 + C_1 h$, which gives $C_1 = -\\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$.\n\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy)$$\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is the integral of the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area $A = wh$:\n$$Q = \\int_A u \\, dA = \\int_0^w \\int_0^h u(y) \\, dy \\, dz = w \\int_0^h \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - hy) \\, dy$$\n$$Q = \\frac{w}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left[ \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{hy^2}{2} \\right]_0^h = \\frac{w}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( \\frac{h^3}{3} - \\frac{h^3}{2} \\right) = -\\frac{wh^3}{12\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nWe can now express the pressure gradient in terms of the flow rate $Q$:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{12\\mu Q}{wh^3}$$\nThe shear stress for a Newtonian fluid is given by $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the magnitude of this stress evaluated at one of the walls (e.g., $y=0$ or $y=h$).\n$$\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (2y-h)$$\nAt the bottom wall ($y=0$):\n$$\\frac{du}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} = -\\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}$$\nThe wall shear stress is then:\n$$\\tau_w = \\left| \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} \\right| = \\left| \\mu \\left(-\\frac{h}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{h}{2} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right|$$\nSince flow occurs in the direction of decreasing pressure, $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is negative, so $\\tau_w = -\\frac{h}{2} \\frac{dp}{dx}$. Substituting the expression for the pressure gradient:\n$$\\tau_w = -\\frac{h}{2} \\left(-\\frac{12\\mu Q}{wh^3}\\right) = \\frac{12\\mu Q h}{2wh^3}$$\n$$\\tau_w = \\frac{6\\mu Q}{wh^2}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the wall shear stress.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\tau_w$ using the provided numerical values.

In vivo, physiological shear stress in human arteries typically ranges from $1$ to $7$ Pa ($10-70$ dyn/cm$^2$). In vitro studies have established that sustained laminar shear stress above a threshold of approximately $0.5 - 1$ Pa ($5-10$ dyn/cm$^2$) causes ECs to elongate and align in the direction of flow. Therefore, the value computed here is well within the physiological range for arterial flow and is expected to induce a strong alignment response in the cultured endothelial cells, making this OoC setup suitable for studying flow-mediated vascular mechanobiology.",

It is directly relevant to the field of systems biomedicine and organ-on-chip technology. Therefore, it is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is provided below.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe solution is derived by applying the principle of mass conservation to the drug distribution in the closed system at equilibrium.\n\nLet $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$ be the total amount (mass) of the drug in the system. Initially, the drug is present only in the culture medium.\nThe initial amount of drug is given by the product of the initial concentration $C_{0}$ and the volume of the medium $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe PDMS is initially drug-free, so its initial drug content is $0$.\n\nThe system is closed, so this total amount of drug, $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is conserved. After a sufficient period, the system reaches equilibrium. At equilibrium, the drug has partitioned between the medium and the PDMS.\n\nLet $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{p}}$ be the drug concentrations in the medium and the PDMS at equilibrium, respectively.\nThe amount of drug in the medium at equilibrium, $M_{\\mathrm{m,eq}}$, is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{m,eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}} V_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe amount of drug in the PDMS at equilibrium, $M_{\\mathrm{p,eq}}$, is:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{p,eq}} = C_{\\mathrm{p}} V_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\n\nAccording to the principle of mass conservation, the sum of the drug amounts in the two compartments at equilibrium must equal the total initial amount:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{total}} = M_{\\mathrm{m,eq}} + M_{\\mathrm{p,eq}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the amounts gives the mass balance equation:\n$$C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}} V_{\\mathrm{m}} + C_{\\mathrm{p}} V_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\n\nThe problem states that at equilibrium, the concentrations are related by the partition coefficient $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{p}}}{C_{\\mathrm{m}}} \\implies C_{\\mathrm{p}} = K C_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThis relationship is based on the assumption of linear, concentration-independent partitioning.\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{p}}$ into the mass balance equation to solve for the unknown equilibrium concentration $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}} V_{\\mathrm{m}} + (K C_{\\mathrm{m}}) V_{\\mathrm{p}}$$\nFactoring out $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}} = C_{\\mathrm{m}} (V_{\\mathrm{m}} + K V_{\\mathrm{p}})$$\nSolving for $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ yields:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}}{V_{\\mathrm{m}} + K V_{\\mathrm{p}}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of the total drug amount that resides in the PDMS walls at equilibrium. Let this fraction be denoted by $f_{\\mathrm{p}}$.\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug in PDMS at equilibrium}}{\\text{Total amount of drug in the system}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{p,eq}}}{M_{\\mathrm{total}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $M_{\\mathrm{p,eq}}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{total}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{p}} V_{\\mathrm{p}}}{C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\nTo find this fraction, we first need to express $C_{\\mathrm{p}}$ in terms of the initial parameters. We use $C_{\\mathrm{p}} = K C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{m}}$ we just derived:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{p}} = K \\left( \\frac{C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}}{V_{\\mathrm{m}} + K V_{\\mathrm{p}}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $C_{\\mathrm{p}}$ into the equation for the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{p}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{\\left( K \\frac{C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}}{V_{\\mathrm{m}} + K V_{\\mathrm{p}}} \\right) V_{\\mathrm{p}}}{C_{0} V_{\\mathrm{m}}}$$\nThe terms $C_{0}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{m}}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel out, leading to a simplified expression for the fraction of drug in the PDMS:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{K V_{\\mathrm{p}}}{V_{\\mathrm{m}} + K V_{\\mathrm{p}}}$$\nThis symbolic result shows that the fraction of drug absorbed by the PDMS depends only on the volumes and the partition coefficient, not on the initial drug concentration, which is a key feature of linear partitioning systems.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this fraction using the given data:\n$V_{\\mathrm{m}} = 50~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{p}} = 200~\\mu\\mathrm{L}$\n$K = 5$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $f_{\\mathrm{p}}$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{5 \\times 200}{50 + (5 \\times 200)}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{1000}{50 + 1000}$$\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{1000}{1050}$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor. First, divide by $10$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{100}{105}$$\nNow, divide by $5$:\n$$f_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\frac{20}{21}$$\nThis is the exact fraction of the total drug amount that resides in the PDMS walls at equilibrium.",

Let $\\bar{X}_1$ and $\\bar{X}_2$ be the corresponding sample means from groups of size $n$. The chips are sampled independently, so the samples are independent.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, states that there is no difference between the group means.\n$$ H_0: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0 $$\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_A$, states that there is a difference.\n$$ H_A: \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 \\neq 0 $$\n\nThe test statistic is the difference in sample means, $D = \\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2$. Based on the Central Limit Theorem and the provided information, the sampling distribution of $D$ is approximately Normal.\nUnder $H_0$, the expectation of $D$ is $E[D] = \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = 0$.\nThe variance of $D$ is $\\text{Var}(D) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1 - \\bar{X}_2) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) + \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2)$. Since the population variance for each group is $\\sigma^2$ and the sample size for each group is $n$, we have $\\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_1) = \\text{Var}(\\bar{X}_2) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n}$.\nThus, the variance of the difference is $\\text{Var}(D) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} = \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}$. The standard error of the difference is $\\text{SE}_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$.\nSo, under $H_0$, the distribution of the test statistic is:\n$$ D \\sim N\\left(0, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\nFor a two-sided test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, we reject $H_0$ if the observed difference $D$ is too far from $0$ in either direction. The rejection region is defined by critical values that cut off $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$ of the probability in each tail of the null distribution. Let $z_{\\alpha/2}$ be the critical value from the standard Normal distribution $N(0,1)$ such that $P(Z > z_{\\alpha/2}) = \\alpha/2$. For $\\alpha = 0.05$, $z_{0.025} \\approx 1.96$.\nThe rejection region for $D$ is $|D| > C$, where the critical value $C$ is:\n$$ C = z_{\\alpha/2} \\cdot \\text{SE}_D = z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} $$\n\nStatistical power is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_A$ is true. We are designing the experiment to detect a specific mean difference, $|\\mu_1 - \\mu_2| = \\Delta = 100$. Without loss of generality, let's assume $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta > 0$.\nUnder this specific alternative, the sampling distribution of $D$ is centered at $\\Delta$:\n$$ D \\sim N\\left(\\Delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}\\right) $$\n\nPower is the probability that an observed $D$ from this alternative distribution falls into the rejection region defined under $H_0$.\n$$ \\text{Power} = 1 - \\beta = P(|D| > C \\mid \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta) $$\n$$ 1 - \\beta = P(D > C \\mid \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta) + P(D < -C \\mid \\mu_1 - \\mu_2 = \\Delta) $$\n\nTo evaluate these probabilities, we standardize $D$ with respect to its distribution under the alternative hypothesis. Let $Z_{H_A} = \\frac{D - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}$. $Z_{H_A}$ follows a standard Normal distribution $N(0,1)$.\nThe first term is:\n$$ P(D > C) = P\\left(\\frac{D - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D} > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) = P\\left(Z_{H_A} > \\frac{z_{\\alpha/2}\\text{SE}_D - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) = P\\left(Z_{H_A} > z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) $$\nThe second term is:\n$$ P(D < -C) = P\\left(\\frac{D - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D} < \\frac{-C - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) = P\\left(Z_{H_A} < \\frac{-z_{\\alpha/2}\\text{SE}_D - \\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) = P\\left(Z_{H_A} < -z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) $$\nSince $\\Delta > 0$ and $z_{\\alpha/2} > 0$, the argument of the cumulative distribution function in the second term, $-z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}$, is a large negative number for any reasonable $n$. The probability $P(Z_{H_A} < \\dots)$ is therefore negligible and can be omitted in this power calculation. This is a standard and safe approximation.\nSo, the power is determined almost entirely by the first term:\n$$ 1 - \\beta \\approx P\\left(Z_{H_A} > z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D}\\right) $$\n\nWe are given the desired power $1 - \\beta = 0.9$, which implies a Type II error rate of $\\beta = 0.1$. Let $z_\\beta$ be the standard Normal critical value such that $P(Z > z_\\beta) = \\beta$. For $\\beta = 0.1$, $z_{0.1} \\approx 1.282$. Note that $P(Z > -z_\\beta) = 1 - P(Z \\le -z_\\beta) = 1 - \\Phi(-z_\\beta) = \\Phi(z_\\beta) = 1-\\beta$.\nSo, for the probability on the right-hand side to equal $1 - \\beta$, its argument must be equal to $-z_\\beta$:\n$$ z_{\\alpha/2} - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D} \\approx -z_\\beta $$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $\\text{SE}_D$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\text{SE}_D} \\approx z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta $$\nNow, we substitute $\\text{SE}_D = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}$ into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta}{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}}} = z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta $$\nWe can now solve for $n$:\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta)}{\\Delta} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2\\sigma^2(z_{\\alpha/2} + z_\\beta)^2}{\\Delta^2} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given values:\n-   $\\sigma = 80$\n-   $\\Delta = 100$\n-   $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{\\alpha/2} = z_{0.025} \\approx 1.960$\n-   $1 - \\beta = 0.9 \\implies \\beta = 0.1 \\implies z_\\beta = z_{0.1} \\approx 1.282$\n\nPlugging these into the derived formula for $n$:\n$$ n = \\frac{2 \\cdot (80)^2 (1.960 + 1.282)^2}{(100)^2} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{2 \\cdot 6400 \\cdot (3.242)^2}{10000} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{12800 \\cdot 10.510564}{10000} $$\n$$ n = \\frac{134535.2192}{10000} $$\n$$ n \\approx 13.45 $$\n\nSince the number of chips, $n$, must be an integer, and we must meet or exceed the specified power, we must take the ceiling of this value.\n$$ n = \\lceil 13.45 \\rceil = 14 $$\nTherefore, a minimum of $14$ chips per group is required to achieve the desired power and significance level.",
