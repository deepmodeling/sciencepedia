            "problem": "A synthetic gene expression module implements a feedforward control action in a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) abstraction commonly used in systems biomedicine. Let $u(t)$ denote a small control input perturbation (for example, a transcriptional activator concentration deviation), $m(t)$ denote messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) deviation, and $p(t)$ denote protein deviation from their operating-point steady states. A simple mass-action kinetic model for the module is\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\alpha\\,u - \\delta_{m}\\,m,\\qquad\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\beta\\,m - \\delta_{p}\\,p,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta>0$ are production coefficients, and $\\delta_{m}>0$ and $\\delta_{p}>0$ are first-order degradation rate constants. The input is $u(t)$ and the measured output is $p(t)$. Using the unilateral Laplace transform with zero initial conditions, compute the input-output transfer function $G(s)$ from $u(t)$ to $p(t)$, identify the poles of $G(s)$ (i.e., the values of $s$ at which $G(s)$ is unbounded), and determine the direct-current (DC) gain $G(0)$. Assume all parameters are strictly positive. Express the transfer function in terms of $s$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\delta_{m}$, and $\\delta_{p}$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass-action kinetics and linear systems theory as applied to systems biology. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and calls for a standard, verifiable analytical derivation.\n\nThe system is described by a set of two coupled linear ordinary differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{dm}{dt} = \\alpha\\,u(t) - \\delta_{m}\\,m(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = \\beta\\,m(t) - \\delta_{p}\\,p(t)\n$$\nwhere $u(t)$ is the input, $p(t)$ is the output, and $m(t)$ is an intermediate state variable. The parameters $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\delta_{m}$, and $\\delta_{p}$ are all strictly positive constants. The goal is to find the transfer function $G(s) = P(s)/U(s)$, its poles, and its direct-current (DC) gain.\n\nWe employ the unilateral Laplace transform, defined as $\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} = F(s) = \\int_0^\\infty f(t)e^{-st} dt$. Let $U(s)$, $M(s)$, and $P(s)$ be the Laplace transforms of $u(t)$, $m(t)$, and $p(t)$, respectively. The Laplace transform of a derivative is given by $\\mathcal{L}\\{\\frac{df}{dt}\\} = sF(s) - f(0)$. The problem specifies zero initial conditions, so $m(0) = 0$ and $p(0) = 0$.\n\nApplying the Laplace transform to the first differential equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dm}{dt}\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\alpha\\,u(t) - \\delta_{m}\\,m(t)\\}\n$$\n$$\nsM(s) - m(0) = \\alpha\\,U(s) - \\delta_{m}\\,M(s)\n$$\nGiven $m(0) = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$\nsM(s) = \\alpha\\,U(s) - \\delta_{m}\\,M(s)\n$$\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $M(s)$ in terms of $U(s)$:\n$$\nsM(s) + \\delta_{m}\\,M(s) = \\alpha\\,U(s)\n$$\n$$\nM(s)(s + \\delta_{m}) = \\alpha\\,U(s)\n$$\n$$\nM(s) = \\frac{\\alpha}{s + \\delta_{m}} U(s)\n$$\nThis expression represents the transfer function from the input $U(s)$ to the intermediate state $M(s)$.\n\nNext, we apply the Laplace transform to the second differential equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}\\left\\{\\frac{dp}{dt}\\right\\} = \\mathcal{L}\\{\\beta\\,m(t) - \\delta_{p}\\,p(t)\\}\n$$\n$$\nsP(s) - p(0) = \\beta\\,M(s) - \\delta_{p}\\,P(s)\n$$\nGiven $p(0) = 0$, we have:\n$$\nsP(s) = \\beta\\,M(s) - \\delta_{p}\\,P(s)\n$$\nWe rearrange to solve for $P(s)$ in terms of $M(s)$:\n$$\nsP(s) + \\delta_{p}\\,P(s) = \\beta\\,M(s)\n$$\n$$\nP(s)(s + \\delta_{p}) = \\beta\\,M(s)\n$$\n$$\nP(s) = \\frac{\\beta}{s + \\delta_{p}} M(s)\n$$\n\nThe overall input-output transfer function, $G(s)$, relates the output $P(s)$ to the input $U(s)$.

The denominator of $G(s)$ is $(s + \\delta_{m})(s + \\delta_{p})$.

            "problem": "A synthetic gene circuit is engineered to regulate a secreted protein using closed-loop feedback and feedforward control. The plant, representing a two-stage biochemical cascade with sequential rate-limiting steps (for example, transcription followed by translation and maturation), is well-approximated as a linear time-invariant system with transfer function $P(s) = \\dfrac{G_{p}}{\\left(1 + \\tau_{1} s\\right)\\left(1 + \\tau_{2} s\\right)}$, where $G_{p} > 0$ is the effective small-signal gain from actuator input to measured protein output, and $\\tau_{1} > 0$, $\\tau_{2} > 0$ are the two stage time constants. The controller is a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller $C(s) = K_{p} + \\dfrac{K_{i}}{s}$ with $K_{p}$ and $K_{i}$ real constants. The reference-to-actuator feedforward path is static with gain $K_{\\mathrm{ff}}$, implemented to reduce steady-state tracking error; assume it does not alter the homogeneous dynamics of the closed loop. The loop uses unity feedback on the measured protein output.\n\nStarting from the core definitions for linear time-invariant feedback systems, derive the third-order closed-loop characteristic polynomial that arises from unity feedback with the PI controller acting on the two-stage plant.

Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for this largest admissible $K_{i}$; do not include any inequalities. No numerical evaluation is required and no units should be reported in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the stability condition for a closed-loop control system. The system consists of a second-order plant, a PI controller, and a unity feedback loop. The stability of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system is determined by the locations of the poles of its closed-loop transfer function. These poles are the roots of the system's characteristic equation. The feedforward path with gain $K_{\\mathrm{ff}}$ acts on the reference signal and does not enter the feedback loop itself; consequently, it affects the zeros of the closed-loop transfer function but not its poles. Therefore, the stability analysis correctly focuses only on the feedback loop components.\n\nThe characteristic equation for a unity feedback system is given by $1 + L(s) = 0$, where $L(s)$ is the open-loop transfer function, defined as the product of the controller transfer function $C(s)$ and the plant transfer function $P(s)$.\n\nThe given plant and controller transfer functions are:\nPlant: $P(s) = \\dfrac{G_{p}}{\\left(1 + \\tau_{1} s\\right)\\left(1 + \\tau_{2} s\\right)}$\nController: $C(s) = K_{p} + \\dfrac{K_{i}}{s} = \\dfrac{K_{p}s + K_{i}}{s}$\n\nThe open-loop transfer function $L(s)$ is the product $C(s)P(s)$:\n$$L(s) = \\left(\\dfrac{K_{p}s + K_{i}}{s}\\right) \\left(\\dfrac{G_{p}}{\\left(1 + \\tau_{1} s\\right)\\left(1 + \\tau_{2} s\\right)}\\right) = \\dfrac{G_{p}(K_{p}s + K_{i})}{s(1 + \\tau_{1} s)(1 + \\tau_{2} s)}$$\n\nThe characteristic equation is $1 + L(s) = 0$:\n$$1 + \\dfrac{G_{p}(K_{p}s + K_{i})}{s(1 + \\tau_{1} s)(1 + \\tau_{2} s)} = 0$$\n\nTo obtain the characteristic polynomial, we clear the denominator by multiplying the entire equation by $s(1 + \\tau_{1} s)(1 + \\tau_{2} s)$:\n$$s(1 + \\tau_{1} s)(1 + \\tau_{2} s) + G_{p}(K_{p}s + K_{i}) = 0$$\nExpanding the denominator term first:\n$$(1 + \\tau_{1} s)(1 + \\tau_{2} s) = 1 + \\tau_{1}s + \\tau_{2}s + \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}s^2 = 1 + (\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})s + \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}s^2$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation:\n$$s\\left(1 + (\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})s + \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}s^2\\right) + G_{p}K_{p}s + G_{p}K_{i} = 0$$\nDistributing the leading $s$ and grouping terms by powers of $s$:\n$$s + (\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})s^2 + \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}s^3 + G_{p}K_{p}s + G_{p}K_{i} = 0$$\n$$(\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2})s^3 + (\\tau_{1}+\\tau_{2})s^2 + (1 + G_{p}K_{p})s + G_{p}K_{i} = 0$$\nThis is the third-order closed-loop characteristic polynomial, as requested.\n\nTo determine the conditions for asymptotic stability, we apply the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion to this cubic polynomial, which we write in the general form $a_3 s^3 + a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0 = 0$. The coefficients are identified as:\n$a_3 = \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}$\n$a_2 = \\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2}$\n$a_1 = 1 + G_{p}K_{p}$\n$a_0 = G_{p}K_{i}$\n\nFor asymptotic stability, all roots of the polynomial must lie in the left half of the complex plane. For a cubic polynomial, the Routh-Hurwitz conditions are:\n1. All coefficients ($a_3, a_2, a_1, a_0$) must be positive.\n2. The inequality $a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$ must hold.\n\nLet us verify the first condition based on the problem statement:\n- $a_3 = \\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}$: Since $\\tau_{1} > 0$ and $\\tau_{2} > 0$, it follows that $a_3 > 0$.\n- $a_2 = \\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2}$: Since $\\tau_{1} > 0$ and $\\tau_{2} > 0$, it follows that $a_2 > 0$.\n- $a_1 = 1 + G_{p}K_{p}$: The problem explicitly states to assume that $K_{p}$ is chosen such that the linear coefficient of the characteristic polynomial is positive, which means $a_1 > 0$.\n- $a_0 = G_{p}K_{i}$: Since $G_{p} > 0$, this condition requires $K_{i} > 0$. We seek the largest positive value for $K_{i}$, so this condition is consistent with the problem's objective.\n\nNow, we apply the second, crucial stability condition:\n$$a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the coefficients:\n$$(\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})(1 + G_{p}K_{p}) > (\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2})(G_{p}K_{i})$$\nThe problem asks for the largest value of $K_{i}$ that guarantees asymptotic stability. This value is the upper bound of the range of $K_{i}$ satisfying this inequality. To find this bound, we solve for $K_{i}$. Since $G_p$, $\\tau_1$, and $\\tau_2$ are all positive constants, their product $G_{p}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}$ is also positive, so we can divide by it without reversing the inequality sign:\n$$K_{i} < \\frac{(\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})(1 + G_{p}K_{p})}{G_{p}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}}$$\nThis inequality, combined with the earlier requirement that $K_{i} > 0$, defines the range for $K_{i}$ that ensures asymptotic stability:\n$$0 < K_{i} < \\frac{(\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})(1 + G_{p}K_{p})}{G_{p}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}}$$\nThe largest value of $K_{i}$ for which the system remains asymptotically stable is the supremum of this interval. At this boundary value, the system becomes marginally stable (the condition becomes an equality, $a_2 a_1 = a_3 a_0$, leading to a pair of poles on the imaginary axis). Therefore, the aformentioned upper bound is the exact expression required.\nLet's denote this maximum value as $K_{i, \\text{max}}$.\n$$K_{i, \\text{max}} = \\frac{(\\tau_{1} + \\tau_{2})(1 + G_{p}K_{p})}{G_{p}\\tau_{1}\\tau_{2}}$$\nThis expression represents the largest admissible integral gain for which the closed-loop system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable.",
