            "problem": "A single-site mutation alters the hydrophobic core of an $80$-residue, two-state folding protein: leucine at position $45$ is replaced by isoleucine. You are asked to derive and compute the expected change in folding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, for this mutation by explicitly accounting for three physically motivated contributions: (i) the nonpolar (hydrophobic) transfer free energy associated with burial of solvent-accessible nonpolar surface area, (ii) the change in void (packing) free energy associated with residual internal cavities in the folded state, and (iii) the energetic penalty for a small perturbation to an existing backbone hydrogen bond near the mutation site.\n\nUse the following experimentally and computationally grounded assumptions and parameters:\n- In the folded state, both side chains are fully buried at position $45$. In the unfolded reference state, the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area (solvent-accessible surface area (SASA)) of the side chains are $A_{\\mathrm{L}} = 150\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$ for leucine and $A_{\\mathrm{I}} = 158\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$ for isoleucine. Model the nonpolar transfer free energy on folding as proportional to the buried nonpolar surface area with coefficient $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} = 0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}$.\n- The residual internal void volume within a $6\\,\\text{\\AA}$ radius of position $45$ in the folded state is $V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = 30\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$ for the wild type and $V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 24\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$ for the mutant. Model the free energy cost of voids as proportional to the void volume with coefficient $p = 0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-3}$.\n- A nearby backbone hydrogen bond is slightly distorted in the mutant relative to wild type. Relative to its near-ideal wild-type geometry, its donor–acceptor distance increases by $\\Delta r = 0.010\\,\\text{nm}$ and its donor–hydrogen–acceptor angle deviates by $\\Delta \\theta = 0.105\\,\\text{rad}$.

Angles are to be treated in radians.\n\nStarting from the thermodynamic definition of folding free energy and first-principles modeling assumptions that (a) the hydrophobic contribution scales with buried nonpolar surface area, (b) the packing penalty scales with residual void volume in the folded state, and (c) small geometric perturbations of a hydrogen bond can be approximated harmonically, derive a closed-form expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$ for this mutation and evaluate it numerically.\n\nExpress the final energy change in $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$, and round your answer to three significant figures. Your final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the change in folding free energy, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, for a leucine-to-isoleucine mutation. The total change is the sum of contributions from the hydrophobic effect, protein core packing (voids), and hydrogen bond energy.\n\nThe change in folding free energy due to the mutation is defined as the difference between the folding free energy of the mutant ($\\mathrm{mut}$) and the wild type ($\\mathrm{wt}$):\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} $$\nHere, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = G_{F} - G_{U}$ is the free energy difference between the folded ($F$) and unfolded ($U$) states.\n\nThe problem specifies that this change is to be calculated by considering three distinct contributions. We can express the total folding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$, as a sum of terms. Assuming that the effects of the mutation are localized and all other energetic contributions cancel out, we can write:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} \\approx \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}} + \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} $$\nwhere the terms correspond to the change in the nonpolar (hydrophobic) contribution, the void/packing contribution, and the hydrogen bond contribution, respectively. We will derive each term separately.\n\n1.  Nonpolar (Hydrophobic) Contribution, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}$\n\nThe hydrophobic contribution to the folding free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}$, is modeled as being proportional to the change in solvent-accessible nonpolar surface area upon folding. The transfer of a nonpolar surface from an aqueous environment to the protein interior is thermodynamically favorable. We define the transfer free energy as $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (A_{F} - A_{U})$, where $A_{F}$ and $A_{U}$ are the nonpolar solvent-accessible surface areas (SASA) of the side chain in the folded and unfolded states, and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} > 0$ is the surface tension coefficient.\n\nFor the wild-type protein with leucine (L), the problem states the side chain is fully buried in the folded state, so its SASA is $A_{\\mathrm{L}, F} = 0$. In the unfolded state, its SASA is given as $A_{\\mathrm{L}} = 150\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (A_{\\mathrm{L}, F} - A_{\\mathrm{L}, U}) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (0 - A_{\\mathrm{L}}) = -\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} A_{\\mathrm{L}} $$\nFor the mutant protein with isoleucine (I), the side chain is also fully buried, so $A_{\\mathrm{I}, F} = 0$. Its unfolded state SASA is $A_{\\mathrm{I}} = 158\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (A_{\\mathrm{I}, F} - A_{\\mathrm{I}, U}) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (0 - A_{\\mathrm{I}}) = -\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} A_{\\mathrm{I}} $$\nThe change in this contribution due to the mutation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = (-\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} A_{\\mathrm{I}}) - (-\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} A_{\\mathrm{L}}) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (A_{\\mathrm{L}} - A_{\\mathrm{I}}) $$\n\n2.  Void (Packing) Contribution, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}}$\n\nThe energetic cost of forming un-filled cavities (voids) in the protein core exists only in the folded state. We assume the free energy of voids in the disordered unfolded state is zero. The folding free energy contribution from voids is thus $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}} = G_{\\mathrm{void}, F} - G_{\\mathrm{void}, U} = G_{\\mathrm{void}, F}$. This free energy penalty is modeled as being proportional to the void volume, $V_{\\mathrm{void}}$, with a coefficient $p$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}} = p V_{\\mathrm{void}} $$\nFor the wild-type protein, the void volume is $V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = p V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} $$\nFor the mutant protein, the void volume is $V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}}$.\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = p V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} $$\nThe change in this contribution due to the mutation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = p V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - p V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = p (V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}) $$\n\n3.  Hydrogen Bond Perturbation, $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}$\n\nA backbone hydrogen bond exists in the folded state but not the unfolded state. The mutation introduces a geometric distortion and an associated energetic penalty in the folded state. Let the energy of the ideal H-bond in the wild-type folded state be $E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}}$. The contribution to folding free energy is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}, F}^{\\mathrm{wt}} - E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}, U}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} - 0 = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}}$.\nIn the mutant, the H-bond is distorted, incurring an energy penalty, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}}$. The energy in the folded state is $E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}, F}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}}$. The contribution to folding free energy for the mutant is $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}, F}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - 0 = E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}}$.\nThe change due to the mutation is:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = (E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}}) - E_{\\mathrm{H-bond}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} = \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}} $$\nThe penalty is modeled as a sum of independent harmonic terms for bond stretching and angle bending:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{penalty}} = \\frac{1}{2}k_r (\\Delta r)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_\\theta (\\Delta \\theta)^2 $$\nTherefore,\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = \\frac{1}{2}k_r (\\Delta r)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_\\theta (\\Delta \\theta)^2 $$\n\nTotal Change in Folding Free Energy\n\nCombining the three contributions, we obtain the closed-form expression for $\\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} (A_{\\mathrm{L}} - A_{\\mathrm{I}}) + p (V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} - V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}}) + \\frac{1}{2}k_r (\\Delta r)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}k_\\theta (\\Delta \\theta)^2 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\gamma_{\\mathrm{np}} = 0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}$\n$A_{\\mathrm{L}} = 150\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$\n$A_{\\mathrm{I}} = 158\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$\n$p = 0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{wt}} = 30\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$\n$V_{\\mathrm{void}}^{\\mathrm{mut}} = 24\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$\n$k_r = 100\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{nm}^{-2}$\n$\\Delta r = 0.010\\,\\text{nm}$\n$k_\\theta = 10\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{rad}^{-2}$\n$\\Delta \\theta = 0.105\\,\\text{rad}$\n\nCalculation of each term:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{np}} = (0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-2}) \\times (150\\,\\text{\\AA}^2 - 158\\,\\text{\\AA}^2) = 0.020 \\times (-8) \\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = -0.16\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{void}} = (0.020\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-3}) \\times (24\\,\\text{\\AA}^3 - 30\\,\\text{\\AA}^3) = 0.020 \\times (-6) \\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = -0.12\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = \\frac{1}{2}(100\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{nm}^{-2})(0.010\\,\\text{nm})^2 + \\frac{1}{2}(10\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}\\,\\text{rad}^{-2})(0.105\\,\\text{rad})^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = \\frac{1}{2}(100)(0.0001)\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + \\frac{1}{2}(10)(0.011025)\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{H-bond}} = 0.005\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 0.055125\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = 0.060125\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n\nThe total change is the sum:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -0.16\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} - 0.12\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 0.060125\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} = -0.28\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} + 0.060125\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} = -0.219875\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fold}} \\approx -0.220\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1} $$\nThe negative value indicates that the L45I mutation is predicted to be slightly stabilizing under this model.",

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of translation kinetics and standard high-throughput experimental data (Ribo-seq, SILAC, polysome profiling). All necessary data are provided and are consistent with one another.\n\nThe solution is derived from the fundamental principle of flux conservation in a steady-state system.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Relationships in Steady-State Translation**\n    The problem states that translation is in a steady state, characterized by a constant flux of ribosomes, $J$, along the entire coding sequence of length $L = 360$ codons. The quantity $J$ represents the number of proteins synthesized per mRNA per unit time, given as $J = 6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n    For any given codon position $i$, the average ribosome occupancy (or density), $\\rho_i$, is related to the flux $J$ and the average time a ribosome dwells at that position, $t_i$. This relationship is an application of Little's Law from queueing theory:\n    $$ \\rho_i = J \\cdot t_i $$\n    A higher occupancy implies a longer dwell time for a constant flux.\n\n    The codon-specific elongation rate, $k_i$, is defined as the inverse of the dwell time:\n    $$ k_i = \\frac{1}{t_i} $$\n    Substituting this into the occupancy equation, we find an inverse relationship between occupancy and elongation rate:\n    $$ \\rho_i = \\frac{J}{k_i} \\implies k_i = \\frac{J}{\\rho_i} $$\n    This equation shows that a high ribosome occupancy (a bottleneck) corresponds to a low local elongation rate.\n\n2.  **Relating Ribo-seq Data to Ribosome Occupancy**\n    Ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) measures ribosome positions by sequencing the mRNA fragments protected by them. The number of A-site counts at a codon $i$, $C_i$, is assumed to be directly proportional to the true average ribosome occupancy at that position, $\\rho_i$. This proportionality extends to the entire transcript: the fraction of total counts at a position $i$ is equal to the fraction of total ribosomes at that position.\n    $$ \\frac{C_i}{S} = \\frac{\\rho_i}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\n    where $S = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} C_j$ is the total number of Ribo-seq counts for the gene, given as $S = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}$, and $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{L} \\rho_j$ is the average total number of ribosomes bound per mRNA, given as $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 9$.\n\n    We can rearrange this to solve for the occupancy $\\rho_i$ in terms of the experimental data:\n    $$ \\rho_i = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{C_i}{S} $$\n\n3.  **Calculating Codon-Specific Elongation Rates**\n    By equating the two expressions for $\\rho_i$, we can derive a formula for the elongation rate $k_i$ based on the provided experimental measurements:\n    $$ \\frac{J}{k_i} = R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\frac{C_i}{S} $$\n    Solving for $k_i$:\n    $$ k_i = \\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_i} $$\n\n    We can now calculate the specific elongation rates for codons $i=120$ and $i=200$.\n    For codon $i=120$, with $C_{120} = 4.8 \\times 10^{2}$:\n    $$ k_{120} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (3.6 \\times 10^{4})}{(9) \\cdot (4.8 \\times 10^{2})} = \\frac{2160}{4320}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n    For codon $i=200$, with $C_{200} = 1.8 \\times 10^{2}$:\n    $$ k_{200} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (3.6 \\times 10^{4})}{(9) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{2})} = \\frac{2160}{1620}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{216}{162}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = \\frac{4}{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\n4.  **Quantifying the Relative Bottleneck Severity**\n    The problem asks for the kinetic bottleneck severity at position $i=120$ relative to position $i=200$, quantified as the fold difference $S^{\\star} = \\frac{k_{200}}{k_{120}}$.\n    A more direct way to calculate this ratio is to use the symbolic expression for $k_i$:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{k_{200}}{k_{120}} = \\frac{\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_{200}}}{\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\cdot C_{120}}} $$\n    The common factor $\\frac{J \\cdot S}{R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$ cancels out, leaving a simple inverse ratio of the Ribo-seq counts:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{C_{120}}{C_{200}} $$\n    This important result shows that the ratio of elongation rates can be determined directly from the ratio of ribosome footprint counts, without needing to know the absolute flux $J$, total ribosomes $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, or total counts $S$.\n\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{4.8 \\times 10^{2}}{1.8 \\times 10^{2}} = \\frac{4.8}{1.8} = \\frac{48}{18} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\n    The value of the ratio is a unitless quantity.\n\n5.  **Final Calculation and Rounding**\n    To express the result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we compute the value of the fraction:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = \\frac{8}{3} = 2.6666... $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives:\n    $$ S^{\\star} = 2.667 $$\n\nThis result indicates that the elongation rate at codon $200$ is approximately $2.667$ times faster than at codon $120$.
