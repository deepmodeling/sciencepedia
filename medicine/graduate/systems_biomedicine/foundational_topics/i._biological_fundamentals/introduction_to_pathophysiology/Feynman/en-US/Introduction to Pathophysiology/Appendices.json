            "solution": "### Validation\nThe problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the alveolar gas equation, a cornerstone of respiratory physiology. All provided parameters are standard and internally consistent for the described clinical scenario. The problem supplies all necessary data to perform the requested calculations and draw a reasoned conclusion based on established pathophysiological principles. The problem is a valid and classic exercise in clinical reasoning. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation followed by a physiological interpretation. First, we compute the alveolar oxygen partial pressure ($P_{A O_2}$). Second, we compute the alveolar-to-arterial oxygen gradient ($A\\text{–}a$ gradient). Third, we use these results to determine the most likely cause of hypoxemia.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Alveolar Oxygen Partial Pressure ($P_{A O_2}$)**\n\nThe alveolar oxygen partial pressure is determined by the balance between the oxygen entering the alveoli from inspired air and the oxygen being removed by pulmonary capillary blood, as well as the diluting effect of alveolar carbon dioxide. This relationship is described by the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{A O_2} = \\left[ F_{I O_2} \\times (P_B - P_{H_2O}) \\right] - \\frac{P_{A CO_2}}{R}$$\nHere, $F_{I O_2}$ is the fraction of inspired oxygen, $P_B$ is the barometric pressure, $P_{H_2O}$ is the partial pressure of water vapor at body temperature, $P_{A CO_2}$ is the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and $R$ is the respiratory quotient. The term $F_{I O_2} \\times (P_B - P_{H_2O})$ represents the partial pressure of inspired oxygen ($P_{I O_2}$) after it has been humidified in the upper airways.\n\nIn clinical practice, it is a standard and valid assumption that the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{A CO_2}$) is in near-perfect equilibrium with the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide ($P_{a CO_2}$) due to the high diffusibility of $\\text{CO}_2$. Thus, we can substitute $P_{a CO_2}$ for $P_{A CO_2}$ in the equation.\n\nUsing the provided values:\n- $F_{I O_2} = 0.21$\n- $P_B = 760 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{H_2O} = 47 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{a CO_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $R = 0.8$\n\nWe substitute these values into the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{A O_2} = \\left[ 0.21 \\times (760 - 47) \\right] - \\frac{60}{0.8}$$\nFirst, calculate the pressure of humidified inspired oxygen:\n$$P_{I O_2} = 0.21 \\times (713) = 149.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nNext, calculate the effect of carbon dioxide displacement:\n$$\\frac{P_{a CO_2}}{R} = \\frac{60}{0.8} = 75 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nFinally, calculate $P_{A O_2}$:\n$$P_{A O_2} = 149.73 - 75 = 74.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Alveolar-to-Arterial Oxygen Gradient ($A\\text{–}a$ Gradient)**\n\nThe $A\\text{–}a$ gradient is defined as the difference between the calculated alveolar oxygen partial pressure and the measured arterial oxygen partial pressure:\n$$A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = P_{A O_2} - P_{a O_2}$$\nWe use the calculated $P_{A O_2}$ and the given $P_{a O_2}$:\n- $P_{A O_2} = 74.73 \\text{ mmHg}$\n- $P_{a O_2} = 55 \\text{ mmHg}$\n\n$$A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = 74.73 - 55 = 19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures, which $19.73$ already is.\n\n**Part 3: Physiological Interpretation**\n\nWe must determine if the patient's hypoxemia ($P_{a O_2} = 55 \\text{ mmHg}$) is most consistent with ventilation-perfusion ($V/Q$) mismatch, right-to-left shunt, or global hypoventilation. To do this, we analyze both the $P_{a CO_2}$ and the $A\\text{–}a$ gradient.\n\n1.  **Analyze $P_{a CO_2}$**: The patient's $P_{a CO_2}$ is $60 \\text{ mmHg}$. The normal range is typically $35\\text{–}45 \\text{ mmHg}$. A $P_{a CO_2}$ of $60 \\text{ mmHg}$ indicates significant hypercapnia, which is a cardinal sign of global hypoventilation (i.e., the lungs as a whole are not exchanging enough gas with the atmosphere).\n\n2.  **Analyze the $A\\text{–}a$ Gradient**: We calculated the patient's $A\\text{–}a$ gradient to be $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$. We should compare this to the expected normal gradient for the patient's age. Using the provided formula:\n    $$\\text{Expected normal } A\\text{–}a \\text{ gradient} = \\frac{\\text{age}}{4} + 4 = \\frac{70}{4} + 4 = 17.5 + 4 = 21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$$\n    The patient's calculated gradient of $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$ is within the expected normal range for their age ($21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$).\n\n3.  **Synthesize the findings**:\n    - **Global Hypoventilation**: This condition is characterized by a high $P_{a CO_2}$ and a *normal* $A\\text{–}a$ gradient. The problem is not with gas transfer across the alveolar-capillary membrane, but rather with insufficient fresh gas reaching the alveoli. The high alveolar $\\text{CO}_2$ \"displaces\" alveolar $\\text{O}_2$ (as seen in the alveolar gas equation), leading to low $P_{A O_2}$ and consequently low $P_{a O_2}$.\n    - **$V/Q$ Mismatch and Shunt**: Both of these conditions are characterized by an *elevated* $A\\text{–}a$ gradient. They represent inefficiencies in gas exchange at the level of the alveolar-capillary unit. In these cases, even if alveolar ventilation were normal, the blood would not be properly oxygenated, causing the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen levels to widen.\n\nThe patient exhibits significant hypercapnia ($P_{a CO_2} = 60 \\text{ mmHg}$) and a normal $A\\text{–}a$ gradient ($19.73 \\text{ mmHg} \\approx 21.5 \\text{ mmHg}$). This combination of findings is the classic presentation of **global hypoventilation** as the primary cause of the hypoxemia. The low arterial oxygen is a direct consequence of the low alveolar oxygen, which in turn is caused by the high alveolar carbon dioxide.\n\nThus, the final computed $A\\text{–}a$ gradient is $19.73 \\text{ mmHg}$, and the most consistent diagnosis for the cause of hypoxemia is global hypoventilation.",

It is scientifically grounded in established principles of renal physiology, well-posed with all necessary data provided for a unique solution, and presented in objective, formal language. The provided clinical values are plausible. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FeNa) is defined as the fraction of sodium filtered by the glomerulus that is ultimately excreted in the urine. This ratio can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{\\text{Sodium Excreted}}{\\text{Sodium Filtered}}\n$$\nThe amount of a substance excreted per unit time is the product of its concentration in the urine and the urine flow rate. The amount of a substance filtered per unit time is the product of its freely-filtered concentration in plasma and the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).\n\nLet $U_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ be the urine sodium concentration, $P_{\\mathrm{Na}}$ be the plasma sodium concentration, $V$ be the urine flow rate, and $\\mathrm{GFR}$ be the Glomerular Filtration Rate.\n\nThe rate of sodium excretion is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Sodium Excreted Rate} = U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V\n$$\nThe rate of sodium filtration is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Sodium Filtered Rate} = P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times \\mathrm{GFR}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of FeNa, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times \\mathrm{GFR}}\n$$\nThis expression contains the urine flow rate $V$ and the GFR, which are often not directly measured. To create a more practical formula, we use the concept of clearance. The problem states that we can approximate GFR with the creatinine clearance, $C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$. Creatinine is a useful marker because it is freely filtered at the glomerulus and is minimally secreted or reabsorbed by the tubules (under most physiological conditions, this assumption is standard).\n\nThe clearance of creatinine, $C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of creatinine per unit time. It is calculated as:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = \\frac{\\text{Creatinine Excretion Rate}}{\\text{Plasma Creatinine Concentration}}\n$$\nLet $U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$ be the urine creatinine concentration and $P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$ be the plasma creatinine concentration. The creatinine excretion rate is $U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\times V$. Therefore,\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\n$$\nUsing the given assumption that $\\mathrm{GFR} \\approx C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$, we can substitute the expression for $C_{\\mathrm{Cr}}$ into the FeNa equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times \\mathrm{GFR}} \\approx \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times \\left( \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} \\times V}{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe urine flow rate variable, $V$, appears in both the numerator and the denominator, allowing it to be cancelled out:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}}\n$$\nRearranging this fraction yields the final, standard expression for FeNa:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times P_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}{P_{\\mathrm{Na}} \\times U_{\\mathrm{Cr}}}\n$$\nNow, we use the provided data to compute the FeNa for this patient:\n- $P_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 140 \\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{Na}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}$\n- $P_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n- $U_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = 100 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{(10 \\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}) \\times (3.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL})}{(140 \\ \\mathrm{mEq/L}) \\times (100 \\ \\mathrm{mg/dL})}\n$$\nThe units cancel, resulting in a dimensionless quantity.\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} = \\frac{30}{14000} = \\frac{3}{1400}\n$$\nCalculating the decimal value:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} \\approx 0.002142857...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\mathrm{FeNa} \\approx 0.002143\n$$\nFinally, we must interpret this result. The FeNa is a critical tool for differentiating between prerenal causes of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) and intrinsic renal causes, such as Acute Tubular Necrosis (ATN), especially in the absence of confounding factors like diuretic use.\n\n- **Prerenal AKI**: This is caused by decreased renal perfusion. The renal tubules are structurally intact and function appropriately to conserve volume by avidly reabsorbing sodium. This leads to a low urine sodium concentration and a low FeNa, typically less than $1\\%$ (or a decimal fraction of $0.01$).\n- **Intrinsic AKI (ATN)**: This involves damage to the renal tubules themselves. The damaged tubules lose their ability to reabsorb sodium effectively, leading to sodium wasting in the urine. This results in a higher FeNa, typically greater than $2\\%$ (or a decimal fraction of $0.02$).\n\nThe patient's calculated FeNa is $0.002143$, which is equivalent to $0.2143\\%$. This value is substantially less than the $1\\%$ ($0.01$) threshold. Given the clinical context of oliguria following decreased effective arterial blood volume and the explicit absence of diuretics, this low FeNa strongly indicates that the renal tubules are functioning correctly and are appropriately conserving sodium in response to perceived volume depletion. Therefore, a **prerenal etiology** is the most likely cause of the patient's AKI.",
