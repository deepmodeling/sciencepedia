The Hill function term models the sigmoidal response of transcription, and the linear degradation term is a standard assumption. The analysis requested—nondimensionalization and bifurcation theory—are central techniques for understanding the dynamics of such biological circuits. The model is firmly rooted in established biochemical and mathematical principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is mathematically well-defined.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems in a biological context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution is provided below.\n\nThe first step is to nondimensionalize the given ODE. We introduce the dimensionless concentration $x$ and dimensionless time $\\tau$ according to the specified scales:\n$$ x = \\frac{X}{K} \\implies X = Kx $$\n$$ \\tau = k_d t \\implies t = \\frac{\\tau}{k_d} $$\nWe must re-express the derivative $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ in terms of the new variables. Using the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = \\frac{dX}{d\\tau} \\frac{d\\tau}{dt} $$\nFrom the definitions, $\\frac{dX}{d\\tau} = K \\frac{dx}{d\\tau}$ and $\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = k_d$. Substituting these gives:\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} $$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $X$ and $\\frac{dX}{dt}$ into the original ODE:\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{(Kx)^{n}}{K^{n} + (Kx)^{n}} - k_{d}(Kx) $$\nWe simplify the right-hand side of the equation:\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{K^{n}x^{n}}{K^{n}(1 + x^{n})} - k_{d}Kx $$\n$$ K k_d \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = v_{\\max} \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - k_{d}Kx $$\nTo obtain the final dimensionless form, we divide the entire equation by $Kk_d$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = \\frac{v_{\\max}}{Kk_d} \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x $$\nThis dimensionless ODE contains a single composite parameter group, which we define as the dimensionless production strength $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{v_{\\max}}{Kk_d} $$\nThe dimensionless equation is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = \\alpha \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x $$\nThe equilibrium locations (fixed points) and their stability are controlled by the minimal set of dimensionless groups, which are the production strength $\\alpha$ and the Hill coefficient $n$.\n\nEquilibria, denoted by $x^*$, are found by setting the rate of change to zero, $\\frac{dx}{d\\tau} = 0$:\n$$ f(x^*) = \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} - x^* = 0 $$\nOne trivial equilibrium is $x^* = 0$. Non-zero equilibria are solutions to:\n$$ \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} = x^* $$\nAssuming $x^* \\neq 0$, we can divide by $x^*$:\n$$ \\alpha \\frac{(x^*)^{n-1}}{1 + (x^*)^{n}} = 1 $$\nA saddle-node bifurcation occurs when the number of equilibria changes. At this critical point, two fixed points (one stable and one unstable) merge and annihilate. This corresponds to a state where the system not only satisfies the equilibrium condition $f(x)=0$, but where the fixed point is also marginally stable, i.e., the slope of the function $f(x)$ is zero, $f'(x)=0$.\n\nWe calculate the derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\alpha \\frac{x^{n}}{1 + x^{n}} - x \\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule for the first term:\n$$ f'(x) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{nx^{n-1}(1+x^n) - x^n(nx^{n-1})}{(1+x^n)^2} \\right) - 1 $$\n$$ f'(x) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{nx^{n-1}}{(1+x^n)^2} \\right) - 1 $$\nAt the bifurcation point, we have a system of two equations for the critical concentration $x_c$ and the critical production strength $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ (1) \\quad \\alpha_c \\frac{x_c^n}{1+x_c^n} - x_c = 0 $$\n$$ (2) \\quad \\frac{\\alpha_c n x_c^{n-1}}{(1+x_c^n)^2} - 1 = 0 $$\nFrom equation (1), for a non-zero fixed point ($x_c \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{x_c(1+x_c^n)}{x_c^n} = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}} $$\nFrom equation (2):\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{(1+x_c^n)^2}{n x_c^{n-1}} $$\nEquating these two expressions for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}} = \\frac{(1+x_c^n)^2}{n x_c^{n-1}} $$\nSince we are looking for non-trivial solutions, $x_c>0$. The term $(1+x_c^n)/x_c^{n-1}$ is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by it:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{n} $$\nSolving for $x_c^n$:\n$$ n = 1 + x_c^n \\implies x_c^n = n-1 $$\nThis gives the critical concentration at which the bifurcation occurs:\n$$ x_c = (n-1)^{1/n} $$\nThis real, positive solution exists because the problem specifies $n > 1$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $x_c^n$ back into one of the equations for $\\alpha_c$. Using $\\alpha_c = \\frac{1+x_c^n}{x_c^{n-1}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{1+(n-1)}{x_c^{n-1}} = \\frac{n}{x_c^{n-1}} $$\nWe need to express $x_c^{n-1}$ in terms of $n$. We can write $x_c^{n-1}$ as $(x_c^n)^{(n-1)/n}$:\n$$ x_c^{n-1} = (n-1)^{ (n-1)/n } $$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $\\alpha_c$:\n$$ \\alpha_c = \\frac{n}{(n-1)^{\\frac{n-1}{n}}} $$\nThis is the critical value of the nondimensional production strength at which the system undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation.",
