            "solution": "The problem requires the execution of a single iteration of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA), also known as the Gillespie algorithm, for a given gene expression network. The state of the system is described by the vector of molecular counts $x(t) = (x_{M}(t), x_{P}(t))$, where $x_{M}$ is the number of messenger RNA molecules and $x_{P}$ is the number of protein molecules.\n\nThe four chemical reactions are:\n1. $R_1: \\varnothing \\xrightarrow{c_1} M$\n2. $R_2: M \\xrightarrow{c_2} M + P$\n3. $R_3: M \\xrightarrow{c_3} \\varnothing$\n4. $R_4: P \\xrightarrow{c_4} \\varnothing$\n\nThe initial state at time $t(0) = 0\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is given as $x(0) = (x_{M}(0), x_{P}(0)) = (3, 10)$. The stochastic rate constants are $c_{1} = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $c_{2} = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $c_{3} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $c_{4} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe first step of the SSA is to calculate the propensity function $a_{\\mu}(x)$ for each reaction $\\mu \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The propensity function represents the probability, per unit time, that a specific reaction occurs given the current state $x$. For mass-action kinetics, the propensities are:\n- $a_{1}(x) = c_{1}$ (zeroth-order reaction)\n- $a_{2}(x) = c_{2} x_{M}$ (first-order reaction)\n- $a_{3}(x) = c_{3} x_{M}$ (first-order reaction)\n- $a_{4}(x) = c_{4} x_{P}$ (first-order reaction)\n\nWe evaluate these propensities at the initial state $x(0) = (3, 10)$:\n- $a_{1}(x(0)) = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $a_{2}(x(0)) = (0.50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(3) = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $a_{3}(x(0)) = (0.10\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(3) = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $a_{4}(x(0)) = (0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(10) = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe total propensity, $a_{0}(x)$, is the sum of the individual propensities. It represents the rate of any reaction occurring.\n$$a_{0}(x(0)) = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} a_{\\mu}(x(0)) = 0.05 + 1.50 + 0.30 + 0.20 = 2.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n\nThe second step is to generate two independent random numbers, $r_{1}$ and $r_{2}$, from a uniform distribution on $(0, 1)$. These are given as $r_{1} = \\exp(-2)$ and $r_{2} = 0.925$.\n\nThe waiting time $\\tau$ until the next reaction is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate $a_{0}(x)$. The memoryless property of the exponential distribution is fundamental here. We can generate $\\tau$ using the inversion method:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{a_{0}(x)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{r_{1}}\\right) = -\\frac{\\ln(r_{1})}{a_{0}(x)}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $r_{1}$ and the calculated $a_{0}(x(0))$:\n$$\\tau = -\\frac{\\ln(\\exp(-2))}{2.05} = -\\frac{-2}{2.05} = \\frac{2}{2.05} \\approx 0.975609756\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get $\\tau \\approx 0.9756\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe next reaction to occur, with index $j$, is determined using the second random number $r_{2}$. The index $j$ is the smallest integer satisfying the condition:\n$$\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{j} a_{\\mu}(x) \\ge r_{2} \\cdot a_{0}(x)$$\nFirst, we compute the target value:\n$$r_{2} \\cdot a_{0}(x(0)) = 0.925 \\cdot 2.05 = 1.89625$$\nNow we check the cumulative sum of propensities:\n- For $j=1$: $\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{1} a_{\\mu} = a_{1} = 0.05$. This is less than $1.89625$.\n- For $j=2$: $\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{2} a_{\\mu} = a_{1} + a_{2} = 0.05 + 1.50 = 1.55$. This is less than $1.89625$.\n- For $j=3$: $\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{3} a_{\\mu} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} = 1.55 + 0.30 = 1.85$. This is less than $1.89625$.\n- For $j=4$: $\\sum_{\\mu=1}^{4} a_{\\mu} = a_{1} + a_{2} + a_{3} + a_{4} = 1.85 + 0.20 = 2.05$. This is greater than or equal to $1.89625$.\n\nThe condition is satisfied for $j=4$. Thus, the next reaction to fire is $R_4$.\n\nThe final step is to update the system time and state.\nThe new time $t'$ is the sum of the old time and the waiting time $\\tau$:\n$$t' = t(0) + \\tau = 0\\,\\mathrm{s} + 0.9756\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.9756\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n\nThe new state $x'$ is obtained by adding the state-change vector $\\nu_j$ for reaction $j=4$ to the old state $x(0)$. The reaction $R_4: P \\rightarrow \\varnothing$ corresponds to a decrease of one molecule of protein $P$. The state-change vector is $\\nu_4 = (0, -1)$.\n$$x' = x(0) + \\nu_4 = (3, 10) + (0, -1) = (3, 9)$$\nThe updated state is $x_{M}' = 3$ and $x_{P}' = 9$.\n\nIn summary, the results of one SSA iteration are:\n- Total propensity $a_{0} = 2.05\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Waiting time $\\tau \\approx 0.9756\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Index of next reaction $j=4$.\n- Updated time $t' \\approx 0.9756\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Updated state $(x_{M}', x_{P}') = (3, 9)$.\n\nThese values are compiled for the final answer.",

In this setting, the system state is a random vector $X(t) \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^3$ representing the copy numbers of species $A$, $B$, and $C$ at time $t$. Each reaction channel $R_j$ has a propensity function $a_j(X(t))$ under stochastic mass-action kinetics and a stoichiometric state-change vector $\\nu_j \\in \\mathbb{Z}^3$ representing the net change in molecular counts when reaction $R_j$ fires once.

We first need to find the propensities for the two reactions in the original volume $V$ and the halved volume $V' = V/2$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Propensities**\n\nFirst, we relate the macroscopic rate constants ($k_1, k_M$) to the stochastic propensities.\n- For the unimolecular reaction $R_1: A \\rightarrow \\varnothing$, the propensity is $a_1 = c_1 X_A$. The stochastic rate constant $c_1$ is directly equal to the macroscopic constant $k_1$. This is because the rate of a unimolecular event depends only on the number of molecules present, not their concentration.\n  $$a_1 = k_1 X_A$$\n- For the bimolecular reaction $R_2: A + B \\rightarrow C$, the propensity is $a_2 = c_2 X_A X_B$. The stochastic rate constant $c_2$ is related to the macroscopic constant $k_M$ by $c_2 = k_M / (N_A V)$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's number and $V$ is the volume. This dependency arises because bimolecular events depend on the collision frequency, which is related to concentration.\n  $$a_2 = \\frac{k_M}{N_A V} X_A X_B$$\n\n**2. Calculations for Original Volume ($V$)**\n\nGiven values: $X_A = 1000$, $X_B = 300$, $k_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_M = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{L \\ mol^{-1} \\ s^{-1}}$, $V = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L}$, $N_A = 6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$.\n\n- **Propensity for Reaction 1:**\n  $a_1 = k_1 X_A = (2.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 1000 = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- **Propensity for Reaction 2:**\n  $c_2 = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\ \\mathrm{L \\ mol^{-1} \\ s^{-1}}}{(6.022 \\times 10^{23} \\ \\mathrm{mol^{-1}})(1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{L})} \\approx 1.6606 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n  $a_2 = c_2 X_A X_B = (1.6606 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) \\times 1000 \\times 300 \\approx 0.49818 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- **Total Propensity (Original):**\n  $a_{0, \\text{orig}} = a_1 + a_2 = 2.0 + 0.49818 = 2.49818 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**3. Calculations for Halved Volume ($V' = V/2$)**\n\n- **Propensity for Reaction 1:** The unimolecular reaction propensity is independent of volume.\n  $a'_1 = a_1 = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- **Propensity for Reaction 2:** The bimolecular propensity is inversely proportional to volume. Halving the volume doubles the propensity.\n  $a'_2 = \\frac{k_M}{N_A (V/2)} X_A X_B = 2 \\left( \\frac{k_M}{N_A V} X_A X_B \\right) = 2a_2$.\n  $a'_2 = 2 \\times 0.49818 = 0.99636 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- **Total Propensity (Halved):**\n  $a_{0, \\text{half}} = a'_1 + a'_2 = 2.0 + 0.99636 = 2.99636 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**4. Ratio of Expected Waiting Times**\n\nThe ratio of the expected waiting times is the inverse ratio of the total propensities:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\text{half}}]}{\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{\\text{orig}}]} = \\frac{1/a_{0, \\text{half}}}{1/a_{0, \\text{orig}}} = \\frac{a_{0, \\text{orig}}}{a_{0, \\text{half}}} $$\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{2.49818}{2.99636} \\approx 0.83374 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is **0.8337**.\n\n**Biological Interpretation**\n\nThe volume change has a differential effect on the reaction propensities.\n- The propensity of the **unimolecular degradation** ($a_1$) is unaffected by the volume shrinkage. This is because a unimolecular event is an intrinsic process; the probability of a single molecule degrading depends on its internal state, not on its proximity to other molecules.\n- The propensity of the **bimolecular binding** ($a_2$) doubles when the volume is halved. This is a direct consequence of increased molecular crowding. Halving the volume doubles the concentration of both species $A$ and $B$, which increases the frequency of their collisions and thus the rate at which they react. The Gillespie framework captures this physical reality through the volume term in the stochastic rate constant.\n\nThis leads to two key biological implications:\n1.  **Increased Overall Reactivity:** The total propensity increases ($a_{0, \\text{half}} > a_{0, \\text{orig}}$), which means the expected waiting time to the next reaction decreases. Biologically, cell shrinkage due to osmotic stress speeds up the overall tempo of biochemical reactions.\n2.  **Shift in Reaction Competition:** The volume change alters the balance between competing reactions. The probability that the next reaction is binding increases from $P(R_2) = a_2/a_{0, \\text{orig}} \\approx 0.199$ in the original volume to $P'(R_2) = a'_2/a_{0, \\text{half}} \\approx 0.332$ in the shrunken cell. This shows how a physical change like cell volume can reprogram the flow of a signaling network, selectively promoting higher-order reactions (like complex formation) over lower-order ones (like degradation).",
