            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which the concentration of species $B$ reaches its maximum in a sequential irreversible reaction system $A \\to B \\to C$. The derivation will proceed from first principles, beginning with the construction of the mathematical model based on mass-action kinetics.\n\nLet the concentrations of the species $A$, $B$, and $C$ at time $t$ be denoted by $[A](t)$, $[B](t)$, and $[C](t)$, respectively. The state vector is $x(t) = \\big([A](t), [B](t), [C](t)\\big)^{\\top}$.\n\nThe system involves two irreversible reactions:\n1. $R_1: A \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} B$\n2. $R_2: B \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} C$\n\nAccording to the law of mass-action kinetics, the rates of these two reactions are given by:\n$v_1 = k_{1} [A](t)$\n$v_2 = k_{2} [B](t)$\n\nThe reaction rate vector $v(x)$ is therefore:\n$$v(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_{1} [A](t) \\\\ k_{2} [B](t) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe stoichiometric matrix $N$ describes the net change in the number of molecules of each species for each reaction. It has dimensions (number of species) $\\times$ (number of reactions), which is $3 \\times 2$.\nFor reaction $R_1$, one molecule of $A$ is consumed ($-1$) and one molecule of $B$ is produced ($+1$). The change in $C$ is $0$. The first column of $N$ is thus $(-1, 1, 0)^{\\top}$.\nFor reaction $R_2$, one molecule of $B$ is consumed ($-1$) and one molecule of $C$ is produced ($+1$). The change in $A$ is $0$. The second column of $N$ is thus $(0, -1, 1)^{\\top}$.\n\nCombining these columns, the stoichiometric matrix $N$ is:\n$$N = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThe dynamics of the system are described by the state-space ordinary differential equation (ODE) system $\\dot{x} = N v(x)$:\n$$\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{d[A]}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{d[B]}{dt} \\\\ \\frac{d[C]}{dt} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} k_{1} [A] \\\\ k_{2} [B] \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -k_{1} [A] \\\\ k_{1} [A] - k_{2} [B] \\\\ k_{2} [B] \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nThis gives the system of three coupled ODEs:\n1. $\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_{1} [A]$\n2. $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{1} [A] - k_{2} [B]$\n3. $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_{2} [B]$\n\nWe solve this system using the initial conditions $[A](0) = A_{0}$, $[B](0) = 0$, and $[C](0) = 0$.\n\nFirst, we solve for $[A](t)$. The first ODE is a separable first-order linear ODE.\n$$\\int_{A_{0}}^{[A](t)} \\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = \\int_{0}^{t} -k_{1} dt'$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[A](t)}{A_{0}}\\right) = -k_{1} t$$\n$$[A](t) = A_{0} \\exp(-k_{1} t)$$\n\nNext, we solve for $[B](t)$. Substitute the expression for $[A](t)$ into the second ODE:\n$$\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{1} A_{0} \\exp(-k_{1} t) - k_{2} [B]$$\nThis can be written as a standard first-order linear ODE:\n$$\\frac{d[B]}{dt} + k_{2} [B] = k_{1} A_{0} \\exp(-k_{1} t)$$\nWe use the integrating factor method. The integrating factor $I(t)$ is $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{2} dt\\right) = \\exp(k_{2} t)$.\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$\\exp(k_{2} t) \\frac{d[B]}{dt} + k_{2} \\exp(k_{2} t) [B] = k_{1} A_{0} \\exp(-k_{1} t) \\exp(k_{2} t)$$\nThe left side is the derivative of $[B](t) \\exp(k_{2} t)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( [B](t) \\exp(k_{2} t) \\right) = k_{1} A_{0} \\exp((k_{2} - k_{1})t)$$\nIntegrate both sides with respect to time from $0$ to $t$. The problem states $k_{2} > k_{1} > 0$, so $k_{2} - k_{1} \\neq 0$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{d}{dt'}\\left( [B](t') \\exp(k_{2} t') \\right) dt' = \\int_{0}^{t} k_{1} A_{0} \\exp((k_{2} - k_{1})t') dt'$$\n$$[B](t) \\exp(k_{2} t) - [B](0) \\exp(0) = k_{1} A_{0} \\left[ \\frac{\\exp((k_{2} - k_{1})t')}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\right]_{0}^{t}$$\nUsing the initial condition $[B](0) = 0$:\n$$[B](t) \\exp(k_{2} t) = \\frac{k_{1} A_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\left( \\exp((k_{2} - k_{1})t) - 1 \\right)$$\nNow, solve for $[B](t)$ by multiplying by $\\exp(-k_{2} t)$:\n$$[B](t) = \\frac{k_{1} A_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\left( \\exp((k_{2} - k_{1})t) \\exp(-k_{2} t) - \\exp(-k_{2} t) \\right)$$\n$$[B](t) = \\frac{k_{1} A_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\left( \\exp(-k_{1} t) - \\exp(-k_{2} t) \\right)$$\n\nTo find the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which $[B](t)$ reaches its maximum value, we must find the critical points by setting its first derivative with respect to time equal to zero.\n$$\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{1} A_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\left( -k_{1} \\exp(-k_{1} t) - (-k_{2}) \\exp(-k_{2} t) \\right)$$\nSet $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = 0$ at $t = t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{1} A_{0}}{k_{2} - k_{1}} \\left( -k_{1} \\exp(-k_{1} t^{\\ast}) + k_{2} \\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast}) \\right) = 0$$\nSince $k_{1}$, $A_{0}$, and $k_{2} - k_{1}$ are all non-zero, the term in the parenthesis must be zero:\n$$-k_{1} \\exp(-k_{1} t^{\\ast}) + k_{2} \\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast}) = 0$$\n$$k_{2} \\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast}) = k_{1} \\exp(-k_{1} t^{\\ast})$$\nTo solve for $t^{\\ast}$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}} = \\frac{\\exp(-k_{1} t^{\\ast})}{\\exp(-k_{2} t^{\\ast})} = \\exp(-k_{1} t^{\\ast} + k_{2} t^{\\ast}) = \\exp((k_{2} - k_{1}) t^{\\ast})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}\\right) = (k_{2} - k_{1}) t^{\\ast}$$\nFinally, we isolate $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}\\right)}{k_{2} - k_{1}}$$\nThis gives the unique time for the extremum. For this extremum to be a maximum, the second derivative $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2}$ must be negative at $t=t^{\\ast}$. At $t=t^{\\ast}$, we have $\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_1[A] - k_2[B] = 0$. The second derivative is $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2} = k_1\\frac{d[A]}{dt} - k_2\\frac{d[B]}{dt}$. At $t=t^{\\ast}$, this simplifies to $\\frac{d^2[B]}{dt^2}|_{t^{\\ast}} = k_1\\frac{d[A]}{dt}|_{t^{\\ast}} = k_1(-k_1 [A](t^{\\ast})) = -k_1^2 [A](t^{\\ast})$. Since $k_1 > 0$ and $[A](t^{\\ast}) = A_0 \\exp(-k_1 t^{\\ast}) > 0$, the second derivative is negative. Thus, $t^{\\ast}$ corresponds to a local maximum. Given that $[B](0)=0$ and $[B](t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$, this single extremum is the global maximum for $t>0$. The condition $k_2 > k_1 > 0$ ensures both the numerator and denominator are positive, so $t^{\\ast} > 0$. The derived expression is dimensionally correct, yielding units of time if $k_1$ and $k_2$ have units of inverse time (e.g., $s^{-1}$).",

            "solution": "The goal is to find a strategy to determine if the reaction $A+B \\to C$ is elementary and to find its rate constant, $k$, using the method of initial rates. A reaction is elementary if its rate law corresponds to its stoichiometry. For the given reaction, elementarity implies the rate law is $v = k[A][B]$, meaning the reaction is first-order with respect to $A$ (order $\\alpha = 1$) and first-order with respect to $B$ (order $\\beta = 1$).\n\nA robust experimental strategy must therefore be able to determine the individual reaction orders, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, separately. The method of isolation, often implemented under pseudo-first-order conditions, is the canonical approach.\n\nThe general initial rate law is:\n$$v_0 = k [A]_0^\\alpha [B]_0^\\beta$$\n\nTo determine $\\alpha$, we hold $[B]_0$ constant and vary $[A]_0$. The rate law becomes $v_0 = k' [A]_0^\\alpha$, where $k' = k [B]_0^\\beta$ is a constant. By plotting $\\log(v_0)$ versus $\\log([A]_0)$, we can find $\\alpha$ as the slope. Alternatively, if we suspect $\\alpha=1$, a plot of $v_0$ versus $[A]_0$ should be a straight line passing through the origin with a slope of $k'$. This experiment establishes the order with respect to $A$.\n\nTo determine $\\beta$, we hold $[A]_0$ constant and vary $[B]_0$. The rate law becomes $v_0 = k'' [B]_0^\\beta$, where $k'' = k [A]_0^\\alpha$. A similar analysis (e.g., a plot of $v_0$ versus $[B]_0$ for suspected $\\beta=1$) establishes the order with respect to $B$.\n\nThe best practice for these isolation experiments is to use pseudo-first-order conditions, where the concentration of the constant reactant is in large excess (e.g., $[B]_0 \\gg [A]_0$ in the first series). This ensures its concentration changes negligibly, simplifying the kinetics.\n\nOnce $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=1$ are established, we can determine $k$.\nFrom the first series of experiments (varying $[A]_0$): the slope of $v_0$ vs. $[A]_0$ is $s_A = k[B]_0$. Thus, $k = s_A / [B]_0$.\nFrom the second series (varying $[B]_0$): the slope of $v_0$ vs. $[B]_0$ is $s_B = k[A]_0$. Thus, $k = s_B / [A]_0$.\n\nA powerful test of the model's validity is to check if the two values of $k$ obtained from these independent experiments are consistent within experimental error. If they are, it provides strong confirmation that the rate law is indeed $v = k[A][B]$ and that the reaction is elementary. The strategy must also explicitly account for potential confounders like reactant depletion and mixing artifacts, as specified in the question.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Execute two pseudo-first-order series: keep $[B]_0$ in large excess and vary $[A]_0$ to obtain a linear fit of $v_0$ versus $[A]_0$ with zero intercept; the slope $s_A$ divided by the known $[B]_0$ yields one estimate of $k$. Independently, keep $[A]_0$ in large excess and vary $[B]_0$ to obtain a linear fit of $v_0$ versus $[B]_0$; the slope $s_B$ divided by the known $[A]_0$ yields a second estimate of $k$. Conclude the step is elementary if both series show first-order dependence in the varied reactant (log–log slope $1$), zero intercepts, and the two $k$ estimates agree within error; verify $<\\!$ $5\\%$ conversion in the window used for $v_0$, mixing time $\\ll$ observation time, and constant buffer conditions.**\n\nThis option precisely describes the method of isolation using pseudo-first-order conditions. It correctly lays out the procedure for determining the order with respect to each reactant independently (by checking for linearity in $v_0$ versus concentration plots). It provides a way to calculate $k$ from each series and, crucially, uses the agreement between the two independently determined values of $k$ as a consistency check. Finally, it explicitly mentions the necessary controls for reactant depletion, mixing time, and environmental conditions. This strategy is rigorous, complete, and directly addresses both parts of the question.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Vary $[A]_0$ and $[B]_0$ together at a fixed ratio (e.g., $[A]_0:[B]_0=1:1$), measure $v_0$, and fit a straight line of $v_0$ versus $[A]_0+[B]_0$; take the slope as $k$ and infer elementarity from linearity.**\n\nThis strategy is flawed. If $[A]_0 = [B]_0$, the rate law $v_0 = k[A]_0^\\alpha[B]_0^\\beta$ becomes $v_0 = k[A]_0^{\\alpha+\\beta}$. A plot of $v_0$ versus $([A]_0+[B]_0) = 2[A]_0$ would be a plot of $k[A]_0^{\\alpha+\\beta}$ versus $2[A]_0$. For an elementary reaction where $\\alpha=1$ and $\\beta=1$, this becomes a plot of $k[A]_0^2$ versus $2[A]_0$, which is a parabola, not a straight line. Therefore, inferring elementarity from linearity is incorrect. This method only allows the determination of the sum of the orders, $\\alpha+\\beta$, but not the individual orders. It is impossible to distinguish between $v=k[A][B]$ and, for example, $v=k[A]^2[B]^0$ with this approach, so elementarity cannot be assessed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Hold $[A]_0=[B]_0$ at multiple values and fit a rectangular hyperbola of $v_0$ versus $[A]_0$ to estimate catalytic parameters $k_{\\text{cat}}$ and $K_M$; declare elementarity if $K_M$ is small and $k_{\\text{cat}}$ is large.**\n\nThis option is fundamentally incorrect as it applies the wrong kinetic model. The Michaelis-Menten equation, which yields a rectangular hyperbola for initial rate versus substrate concentration, describes enzyme-catalyzed reactions with a saturable mechanism ($E+S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\to E+P$). The reaction given is a simple bimolecular association, $A+B\\to C$. Applying a Michaelis-Menten fit is inappropriate and the resulting parameters ($k_{\\text{cat}}$, $K_M$) would be meaningless in this context. Elementarity of an association reaction is determined by its partial orders, not by parameters from an unrelated model.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Collect full time courses $[A](t)$ and $[B](t)$ and fit an integrated bimolecular decay without restricting to initial rates; infer elementarity from goodness-of-fit and extract $k$ from the global time-course fit.**\n\nWhile fitting the integrated rate law to full time-course data is a valid and powerful kinetic analysis method, it directly contradicts the constraint given in the problem statement: \"to identify the second-order rate constant $k$ using **only initial rates**\". The problem is specifically a test of understanding the design of initial rate experiments. Therefore, this option proposes a valid alternative methodology but fails to answer the question as posed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

Derivation of the Chemical Master Equation (CME)**\n\nThe state of the system at any time $t$ is described by the integer vector of molecular counts $\\mathbf{n} = (n_{A}, n_{B})$, where $n_{A}, n_{B} \\in \\mathbb{N}_0 = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.

The state change vector for this reaction is $\\boldsymbol{\\nu} = (-1, +1)$.\n\nThe propensity function for this reaction, when the system is in state $(n_A, n_B)$, is given by the mass-action principle as $\\alpha(n_{A}) = c_{1} n_{A}$.\n\nThe Chemical Master Equation describes the time evolution of the probability $P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t)$. It is a balance equation accounting for the probability flux into and out of each state.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t) = (\\text{rate of inflow into state } (n_{A}, n_{B})) - (\\text{rate of outflow from state } (n_{A}, n_{B}))\n$$\n\n**Outflow Term:** The system leaves state $(n_{A}, n_{B})$ if the reaction $A \\to B$ occurs.

If $n_A=0$, the propensity is $0$, and no reaction can occur, correctly reflecting the physical boundary.\n\n**Inflow Term:** The system enters state $(n_{A}, n_{B})$ if it was previously in a state from which the reaction $A \\to B$ leads to $(n_{A}, n_{B})$.

The interchange of differentiation and summation is justified because the sum converges uniformly for a finite total number of molecules, and for well-behaved stochastic processes in general.\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} n_{A} \\frac{d}{dt} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t)\n$$\nSubstituting the CME expression derived in Part 1:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} n_{A} \\left[ c_{1} (n_{A}+1) P(n_{A}+1, n_{B}-1, t) - c_{1} n_{A} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t) \\right]\n$$\nWe split the summation into two parts:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = c_{1} \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} n_{A} (n_{A}+1) P(n_{A}+1, n_{B}-1, t) - c_{1} \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} n_{A}^{2} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t)\n$$\nThe second term is directly related to the second moment of $X_A(t)$:\n$$\n- c_{1} \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} n_{A}^{2} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t) = -c_{1} \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)^{2}]\n$$\nFor the first term, we perform a change of summation indices. Let $k_{A} = n_{A}+1$ and $k_{B} = n_{B}-1$. This implies $n_{A} = k_{A}-1$ and $n_{B} = k_{B}+1$. The summation ranges change accordingly: as $n_{A}$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$, $k_{A}$ goes from $1$ to $\\infty$; as $n_{B}$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$, $k_{B}$ goes from $-1$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\nc_{1} \\sum_{k_{A}=1}^{\\infty} \\sum_{k_{B}=-1}^{\\infty} (k_{A}-1) k_{A} P(k_{A}, k_{B}, t)\n$$\nSince $P(k_A, k_B, t) = 0$ for $k_B  0$, the sum over $k_B$ can start from $0$. We can also start the sum over $k_A$ from $0$ because the term $(k_A-1)k_A$ is zero for $k_A=0$. After relabeling the dummy indices $k_A \\to n_A$ and $k_B \\to n_B$, the first term becomes:\n$$\nc_{1} \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} (n_{A}-1) n_{A} P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t) = c_{1} \\sum_{n_{A}=0}^{\\infty} \\sum_{n_{B}=0}^{\\infty} (n_{A}^{2} - n_{A}) P(n_{A}, n_{B}, t)\n$$\nThis manipulation is valid because expectations are defined over the entire state space of non-negative integers. This expression is equivalent to:\n$$\nc_{1} \\left( \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)^{2}] - \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)] \\right)\n$$\nCombining both parts:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = c_{1} \\left( \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)^{2}] - \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)] \\right) - c_{1} \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)^{2}]\n$$\nThe second moment terms cancel out:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = - c_{1} \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)]\n$$\nSubstituting the definition $m_{A}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(t)]$, we obtain the ordinary differential equation for the mean:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}(t)}{dt} = -c_{1} m_{A}(t)\n$$\n\n**3. Solution of the Mean-Field Equation**\n\nWe have the first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d m_{A}}{dt} = -c_{1} m_{A}\n$$\nThe initial condition is given as $X_{A}(0) = a_{0}$, where $a_{0}$ is a non-negative integer. This is a deterministic initial condition, so the probability distribution at $t=0$ is a Kronecker delta, $\\Pr(X_A(0) = n_A) = \\delta_{n_A, a_0}$. The initial mean is therefore:\n$$\nm_{A}(0) = \\mathbb{E}[X_{A}(0)] = a_{0}\n$$\nThe general solution to the differential equation is found by separation of variables or by using an integrating factor. It is of the form:\n$$\nm_{A}(t) = C \\exp(-c_{1} t)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We determine $C$ using the initial condition at $t=0$:\n$$\nm_{A}(0) = C \\exp(-c_{1} \\cdot 0) = C \\cdot 1 = C\n$$\nThus, $C = a_{0}$.\n\nThe final closed-form analytic expression for the mean molecular count of species $A$ as a function of time is:\n$$\nm_{A}(t) = a_{0} \\exp(-c_{1} t)\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{a_{0} \\exp(-c_{1} t)}$$"
