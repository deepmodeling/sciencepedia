Let $G = (V,E)$ denote the graph, where $V = \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges with $(i,j) \\in E$ if and only if $A_{ij} = 1$. The degree of a node $i$ is $d(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{ij}$. A subgraph $H$ induced by $S \\subseteq V$ is the pair $(S, E|_S)$ where $E|_S = \\{(i,j) \\in E \\mid i \\in S, j \\in S\\}$. The $k$-core of $G$ is defined as the unique maximal induced subgraph $H_k$ such that every node in $H_k$ has degree at least $k$ when degrees are computed with respect to $H_k$. The core number (also called coreness) of a node $i$ is the largest integer $k \\ge 0$ such that $i \\in H_k$.\n\nTask: Starting from the core definitions above and the basic notion of iterative constraint satisfaction on graphs (remove nodes that violate a local degree threshold until a fixed point is reached), derive an algorithm that computes, for a given adjacency matrix $A$, the core number vector $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^n$ where $c_i$ is the core number of node $i$. Your derivation must identify why the fixed-point iterative pruning procedure terminates, why the resulting subgraph is maximal, and why the largest $k$ for which a node $i$ survives equals its core number.\n\nEpistemic significance requirement: Explain, in formal terms grounded in the above definitions, why the $k$-core identifies substructures that are robust under removal of low-degree nodes, and how this relates to resilience analysis in systems biomedicine where biological interaction networks exhibit modularity and redundancy.\n\nComputation requirement: Implement the algorithm you derive and apply it to the following test suite of adjacency matrices. For each test case, compute and return the list of core numbers in node index order $[0,1,\\dots,n-1]$.\n\nTest suite:\n- Case A (mixed dense and sparse structure, $n=6$):\n$$\nA^{(A)} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n- Case B (empty graph, $n=4$):\n$$\nA^{(B)} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n- Case C (complete graph $K_5$, $n=5$):\n$$\nA^{(C)} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n- Case D (star graph with center at node $0$, $n=6$):\n$$\nA^{(D)} =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFinal output specification: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of an algorithm to compute the core number for each node in a graph specified by an adjacency matrix $A$.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens**\n- **Graph representation**: Undirected simple graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$, no self-loops. Represented by a symmetric adjacency matrix $A \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times n}$ with zeros on the diagonal. An edge $(i,j) \\in E$ exists if and only if $A_{ij}=1$.\n- **Node degree**: The degree of a node $i$ is $d(i) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} A_{ij}$.\n- **Induced subgraph**: For a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$, the induced subgraph $H=(S, E|_S)$ contains the nodes $S$ and all edges from $E$ that connect two nodes in $S$.\n- **$k$-core**: The unique maximal induced subgraph $H_k$ where every node in $H_k$ has a degree of at least $k$ with respect to the subgraph $H_k$.\n- **Core number (coreness)**: The core number of a node $i$, denoted $c_i$, is the largest integer $k \\ge 0$ such that node $i$ is a member of the vertex set of the $k$-core, $H_k$.\n- **Task**: Derive an algorithm to compute the core number vector $c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}^n$. The derivation must justify the algorithm's correctness (termination, maximality, etc.).\n- **Epistemic Requirement**: Explain the relationship between $k$-cores, robustness, and their application in systems biomedicine.\n- **Computation Requirement**: Implement the algorithm and apply it to four test cases: $A^{(A)}$, $A^{(B)}$, $A^{(C)}$, and $A^{(D)}$.\n- **Output Format**: A single line containing a list of lists of core numbers, e.g., `[[c_A], [c_B], [c_C], [c_D]]`.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: All definitions (graph, adjacency matrix, degree, induced subgraph, $k$-core, core number) are standard and fundamental concepts in graph theory and network science. The problem is scientifically and mathematically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The definitions are precise and unambiguous. For any given graph, the $k$-core is uniquely defined, and consequently, the core number of each node is also uniquely determined. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in formal mathematical language, free from subjectivity or bias.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary definitions and data (the adjacency matrices for the test cases). There are no contradictions.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Algorithm Derivation and Justification\n\n**2.1. Finding the $k$-core for a fixed $k$**\n\nThe definition of the $k$-core suggests an algorithm based on iterative constraint satisfaction. The constraint is that every node in the target subgraph must have a degree of at least $k$. We can find the $k$-core by starting with the entire graph $G$ and iteratively removing any nodes that violate this constraint.\n\nLet $G_0 = G$. For $t = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$, let $G_t = (V_t, E_t)$ be the graph at step $t$.\n1. Identify the set of nodes to be removed: $S_t = \\{v \\in V_t \\mid \\deg_{G_t}(v) < k\\}$.\n2. If $S_t$ is empty, the process has reached a fixed point. The current graph $G_t$ is the $k$-core.\n3. If $S_t$ is not empty, form the next graph $G_{t+1}$ by removing the nodes in $S_t$ and their incident edges. $G_{t+1}$ is the subgraph of $G_t$ induced by the vertex set $V_{t+1} = V_t \\setminus S_t$.\n4. Repeat from step 1.\n\n**Justification:**\n- **Termination**: The graph is finite. At each step where $S_t$ is non-empty, at least one node is removed from the graph. Since nodes are never added, this process must terminate in at most $n$ steps.\n- **Correctness**: The resulting subgraph, let's call it $H'$, contains only nodes with degree at least $k$ within $H'$, by construction.\n- **Maximality**: To show $H'$ is the unique *maximal* such subgraph, we use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists another induced subgraph $H''$ satisfying the $k$-core property (all nodes have degree $\\ge k$ within $H''$), such that $V(H') \\subset V(H'')$. Let $v$ be a node in $V(H'') \\setminus V(H')$. Since $v$ is not in $H'$, it must have been removed by our algorithm at some step $t$. This means its degree in the graph $G_t$ was less than $k$, i.e., $\\deg_{G_t}(v) < k$. However, at that step $t$, the vertex set $V_t$ was a superset of $V(H'')$, because $v$ had not yet been removed. Therefore, the degree of $v$ in $G_t$ must be greater than or equal to its degree in $H''$: $\\deg_{G_t}(v) \\ge \\deg_{H''}(v)$. By the premise for $H''$, we know $\\deg_{H''}(v) \\ge k$. This leads to the contradiction $\\deg_{G_t}(v) \\ge k$. Thus, no such $H''$ can exist, and the subgraph $H'$ found by the algorithm is the unique maximal $k$-core.\n\n**2.2. Computing Core Numbers for All Nodes**\n\nThe core number $c_i$ is the largest $k$ such that node $i$ is in the $k$-core $H_k$. This is equivalent to saying that $c_i=k$ if node $i$ is in $H_k$ but not in $H_{k+1}$. This directly suggests an algorithm. The set of all nodes with core number $k$ is $V(H_k) \\setminus V(H_{k+1})$.\n\nThe $k$-cores form a nested sequence of subgraphs: $G \\supseteq H_1 \\supseteq H_2 \\supseteq \\dots \\supseteq H_{k_{\\text{max}}}$. We can find the core numbers by iteratively peeling away the outermost layers of the graph.\n\n**Algorithm:**\n1. Initialize a mutable array of current degrees, `d_current`, with the degrees of all nodes in the original graph $G$.\n2. Initialize a `cores` array of size $n$ with a sentinel value (e.g., $-1$) indicating that no core number has been assigned yet.\n3. Initialize a variable for the current core level, `k = 0`.\n4. While there are still nodes with unassigned core numbers:\n    a. Repeatedly find all active nodes `v` (where `cores[v]` is still the sentinel value) whose current degree `d_current[v]` is less than or equal to `k`.\n    b. If no such nodes exist, increment `k` and go to step 4a.\n    c. For each such node `v`:\n        i. Assign its core number: `cores[v] = k`.\n        ii. \"Remove\" `v` from the graph (conceptually, by marking it as processed).\n        iii. For each neighbor `u` of `v`, decrement its current degree: `d_current[u] -= 1`.\n    d. Repeat step 4a without incrementing `k`, as the degree reduction may cause other nodes to now satisfy the condition `d_current <= k`.\n5. The `cores` array now holds the core number for each node.\n\nThis \"level-by-level\" peeling process ensures that when a node `v` is removed at level `k`, it is because its degree has dropped to `k` (or less), and it cannot be part of any higher-order core. The set of nodes removed at stage `k` are precisely those that belong to the `k`-core but not the `(k+1)`-core.\n\n### Step 3: Epistemic Significance in Systems Biomedicine\n\nThe $k$-core decomposition provides a topologically-grounded method for identifying influential or central parts of a network, which is highly relevant to the analysis of biological systems.\n\n- **Robustness and Resilience**: In network theory, robustness refers to the ability of a system to maintain its function despite perturbations, such as the removal of nodes or edges. The $k$-core structure formalizes one aspect of this. The innermost core, $H_{k_{\\text{max}}}$, represents the most densely interconnected and resilient part of the network. Removing low-degree (peripheral) nodes does not affect the integrity of this core. A node with a high core number $c_i$ is structurally embedded in a robust neighborhood, meaning its removal would require the prior or simultaneous failure of many other nodes in its local, dense community.\n\n- **Modularity and Redundancy in Biological Networks**: Biological networks, such as protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks or gene regulatory networks, are known to be modular. These modules often correspond to groups of biomolecules that cooperate to perform a specific biological function (e.g., a protein complex or a signaling pathway). High-order cores frequently map to these functional modules. The high interconnectivity within a core provides redundancy; if one protein (node) is knocked out, its function may be compensated for by its numerous partners within the same core, making the overall function resilient to single-point failures. For example, in a PPI network, the $k_{\\text{max}}$-core may comprise proteins essential for cell survival, forming a stable complex. Identifying such cores helps researchers pinpoint critical components of cellular machinery, which can be potential targets for drug development or biomarkers for disease. Peripheral nodes (low core numbers) may be involved in less critical or more transient functions, connecting different modules or responding to external stimuli.\n\n### Step 4: Implementation and Computation\n\nThe derived algorithm is implemented to process the given test suite of adjacency matrices. The results are computed and formatted as specified.\n\nThe implemented algorithm follows the \"level-by-level\" peeling logic derived in Section 2.2. It iterates through core levels `k` from $0$ upwards. In each iteration, it repeatedly finds and \"removes\" all nodes whose current degree has fallen to `k` or below, assigning them the core number `k`. This process continues until all nodes have been assigned a core number.",

We solve for $P$ in the equation $A^{\\top}P + PA = -I$.\n\nLet $P = \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}-1.5 & 2.0 \\\\ -1.0 & -3.0\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} p_{11} & p_{12} \\\\ p_{12} & p_{22} \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}-1.5 & -1.0 \\\\ 2.0 & -3.0\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the matrix products gives:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -3p_{11} + 4p_{12} & -p_{11} - 4.5p_{12} + 2p_{22} \\\\ -p_{11} - 4.5p_{12} + 2p_{22} & -2p_{12} - 6p_{22} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}-1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields a system of linear equations for the elements of $P$:\n1) $-3p_{11} + 4p_{12} = -1$\n2) $-p_{11} - 4.5p_{12} + 2p_{22} = 0$\n3) $-2p_{12} - 6p_{22} = -1 \\implies 2p_{12} + 6p_{22} = 1$\n\nFrom (1), $p_{11} = \\frac{1+4p_{12}}{3}$. From (3), $p_{22} = \\frac{1-2p_{12}}{6}$. Substituting these into (2):\n$$\n-\\left(\\frac{1+4p_{12}}{3}\\right) - 4.5p_{12} + 2\\left(\\frac{1-2p_{12}}{6}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{3}p_{12} - \\frac{9}{2}p_{12} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{2}{3}p_{12} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{4}{3} - \\frac{9}{2} - \\frac{2}{3}\\right)p_{12} = 0 \\implies \\left(-2 - \\frac{9}{2}\\right)p_{12} = 0 \\implies -6.5p_{12} = 0\n$$\nThus, $p_{12}=0$. Substituting back, we find $p_{11} = 1/3$ and $p_{22} = 1/6$.\nThe matrix $P$ is:\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix is diagonal with positive entries, so it is positive definite. The Lyapunov function is $V(z) = \\frac{1}{3}z_1^2 + \\frac{1}{6}z_2^2$, and its derivative is $\\dot{V}(z) = -z^{\\top}Iz = -\\|z\\|^2$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the upper bound $T_{\\delta}$**\n\nThe Lyapunov function $V(z)$ can be bounded in terms of the squared Euclidean norm $\\|z\\|^2 = z^{\\top}z$. The bounds are related to the minimum and maximum eigenvalues of $P$, $\\lambda_{\\min}(P)$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}(P)$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\|z\\|^2 \\le V(z) \\le \\lambda_{\\max}(P)\\|z\\|^2\n$$\nFor our diagonal matrix $P$, the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements: $\\lambda_{\\min}(P) = 1/6$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}(P) = 1/3$.\nFrom $\\dot{V}(z) = -\\|z\\|^2$ and $\\|z\\|^2 \\ge V(z)/\\lambda_{\\max}(P)$, we get the differential inequality:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(z) \\le -\\frac{V(z)}{\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}\n$$\nBy Grönwall's inequality, this implies an exponential decay for $V(z(t))$:\n$$\nV(z(t)) \\le V(z(0)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}\\right)\n$$\nWe want to find an upper bound on the time $T_{\\delta}$ such that for all $t \\ge T_{\\delta}$, $\\|z(t)\\| \\le \\delta$. This condition is guaranteed if we ensure that $\\|z(t)\\|^2 \\le \\delta^2$.\nUsing the lower bound on $V(z)$, we have $\\|z(t)\\|^2 \\le V(z(t))/\\lambda_{\\min}(P)$.\nSo, the condition $\\|z(t)\\| \\le \\delta$ is met if $V(z(t))/\\lambda_{\\min}(P) \\le \\delta^2$, or $V(z(t)) \\le \\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2$.\nWe can find $T_{\\delta}$ by setting the upper bound of $V(z(t))$ to this value:\n$$\nV(z(0)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\delta}}{\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}\\right) = \\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2\n$$\nSolving for $T_{\\delta}$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{\\delta}}{\\lambda_{\\max}(P)}\\right) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2}{V(z(0))}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{T_{\\delta}}{\\lambda_{\\max}(P)} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2}{V(z(0))}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\delta} = -\\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2}{V(z(0))}\\right) = \\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\ln\\left(\\frac{V(z(0))}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe system is initially at steady state for $u_0=0$. So, $\\mathbf{x}(0) = \\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}(u_0) = -A^{-1}Bu_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The new equilibrium is $\\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}(u_1) = -A^{-1}Bu_1$.\nThe initial error is $z(0) = \\mathbf{x}(0) - \\mathbf{x}^{\\ast}(u_1) = -A^{-1}B(u_0 - u_1)$.\nThe initial value of the Lyapunov function is $V(z(0)) = z(0)^{\\top}Pz(0) = (-A^{-1}B(u_0 - u_1))^{\\top}P(-A^{-1}B(u_0 - u_1))$.\n$$\nV(z(0)) = (u_1-u_0)^2 (A^{-1}B)^{\\top}P(A^{-1}B)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $T_{\\delta}$ gives the final analytic form.\n\n**3. Numerical evaluation of $T_{\\delta}$**\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary numerical values.\nThe inverse of $A$ is $A^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(A)}\\begin{pmatrix}-3.0 & 1.0 \\\\ -2.0 & -1.5\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{6.5}\\begin{pmatrix}-3.0 & 1.0 \\\\ -2.0 & -1.5\\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe initial error $z(0)$ is:\n$$\nz(0) = -A^{-1}B(u_0 - u_1) = -\\frac{1}{6.5}\\begin{pmatrix}-3.0 & 1.0 \\\\ -2.0 & -1.5\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1.0 \\\\ 0.0\\end{pmatrix}(0-1) = \\frac{1}{6.5}\\begin{pmatrix}-3.0 \\\\ -2.0\\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{13}\\begin{pmatrix}-6 \\\\ -4\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute $V(z(0)) = z(0)^{\\top}Pz(0)$:\n$$\nV(z(0)) = \\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\begin{pmatrix}-6 \\\\ -4\\end{pmatrix}\\right)^{\\top} \\begin{pmatrix}1/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6\\end{pmatrix} \\left(\\frac{1}{13}\\begin{pmatrix}-6 \\\\ -4\\end{pmatrix}\\right) = \\frac{1}{169}\\begin{pmatrix}-6 & -4\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1/3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1/6\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}-6 \\\\ -4\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nV(z(0)) = \\frac{1}{169}\\left(\\frac{1}{3}(-6)^2 + \\frac{1}{6}(-4)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{169}\\left(\\frac{36}{3} + \\frac{16}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{169}\\left(12 + \\frac{8}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{169}\\left(\\frac{44}{3}\\right) = \\frac{44}{507}\n$$\nWe have the following parameters:\n- $\\lambda_{\\max}(P) = 1/3$\n- $\\lambda_{\\min}(P) = 1/6$\n- $V(z(0)) = 44/507$\n- $\\delta = 0.05 = 1/20 \\implies \\delta^2 = 1/400$\n\nWe substitute these values into the expression for $T_{\\delta}$:\n$$\nT_{\\delta} = \\lambda_{\\max}(P) \\ln\\left(\\frac{V(z(0))}{\\lambda_{\\min}(P)\\delta^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{44/507}{(1/6)(1/400)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\delta} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{44/507}{1/2400}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{44 \\times 2400}{507}\\right)\n$$\nSince $507 = 3 \\times 169$ and $2400 = 3 \\times 800$, we can simplify the argument of the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{44 \\times 2400}{507} = \\frac{44 \\times 3 \\times 800}{3 \\times 169} = \\frac{44 \\times 800}{169} = \\frac{35200}{169}\n$$\nSo, the final analytical expression for the time is:\n$$\nT_{\\delta} = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln\\left(\\frac{35200}{169}\\right)\n$$\nNumerically, this value is:\n$$\nT_{\\delta} \\approx \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(208.28402...) \\approx \\frac{1}{3}(5.33890...) \\approx 1.779634...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $T_{\\delta} \\approx 1.780$.

Let $X_{\\text{free}}$, $B_{\\text{free}}$, and $L_{\\text{free}}$ denote the concentrations of free $X$, $B$, and $L$ sites, respectively. Let $[XB]$ and $[XL]$ be the concentrations of the complexes.\n\nThe total concentrations are conserved:\n$1.$ Total $X$: $X_{\\text{tot}} = X_{\\text{free}} + [XB] + [XL]$\n$2.$ Total buffer: $B_{\\text{tot}} = B_{\\text{free}} + [XB]$\n$3.$ Total load: $L_{\\text{tot}} = L_{\\text{free}} + [XL]$\n\nThe rapid binding equilibria are described by the dissociation constants:\n$4.$ Buffer binding: $K_{d}^{B} = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}} B_{\\text{free}}}{[XB]}$\n$5.$ Load binding: $K_{d}^{L} = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}} L_{\\text{free}}}{[XL]}$\n\nFrom these equations, we express the concentrations of the complexes in terms of total concentrations and $X_{\\text{free}}$. From equations $(2)$ and $(4)$:\n$[XB] = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}} B_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B}} = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}} (B_{\\text{tot}} - [XB])}{K_{d}^{B}}$\nSolving for $[XB]$ gives:\n$[XB](K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}) = X_{\\text{free}} B_{\\text{tot}} \\implies [XB] = \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}}$\n\nSimilarly, from equations $(3)$ and $(5)$:\n$[XL] = \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}}$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass conservation equation for $X$ (1) yields the central equation of the system:\n$$ X_{\\text{tot}} = X_{\\text{free}} + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} $$\nThis equation implicitly defines $X_{\\text{free}}$ as a function of the system's total species concentrations $X_{\\text{tot}}$, $B_{\\text{tot}}$, and $L_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the log-sensitivity, $S$.\n$$ S = \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\ln X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial \\ln L_{\\text{tot}}}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{L_{\\text{tot}}}{X_{\\text{free}}} \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}\\right| $$\nTo find the derivative $\\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}$, we perform implicit differentiation on the central equation with respect to $L_{\\text{tot}}$, treating $X_{\\text{tot}}$ and $B_{\\text{tot}}$ as constants.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} (X_{\\text{tot}}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( X_{\\text{free}} + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} \\right) $$\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} + \\frac{d}{d X_{\\text{free}}} \\left(\\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}}\\right) \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}\\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}}\\right) $$\nUsing the quotient rule for the buffer term:\n$\\frac{d}{d X_{\\text{free}}} \\left(\\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}}}\\right) = \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}})^2}$\nUsing the product rule and quotient rule for the load term:\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}\\left(\\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}}\\right) = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} + L_{\\text{tot}} \\frac{d}{d X_{\\text{free}}}\\left(\\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}}\\right)\\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} = \\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}$\nSubstituting these back into the differentiated equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} + \\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} $$\nSolving for $\\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} \\right) = - \\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} = - \\frac{ \\frac{X_{\\text{free}}}{K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}}} }{ 1 + \\frac{B_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{B}}{(K_{d}^{B} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} + \\frac{L_{\\text{tot}} K_{d}^{L}}{(K_{d}^{L} + X_{\\text{free}})^2} } $$\nSince an increase in load $L_{\\text{tot}}$ sequesters more $X$, $X_{\\text{free}}$ must decrease, so $\\frac{\\partial X_{\\text{free}}}{\\partial L_{\\text{tot}}} < 0$.
