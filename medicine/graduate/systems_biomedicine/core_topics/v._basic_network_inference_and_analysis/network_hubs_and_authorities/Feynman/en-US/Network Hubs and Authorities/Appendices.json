The out-degree of a node $v_{i}$ is defined as $k_{i}^{\\text{out}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} a_{ij}$ and the in-degree is defined as $k_{i}^{\\text{in}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{4} a_{ji}$.

Since $0 < 3$, $v_4$ is not a hub.\n\nThe only node identified as a hub is $v_1$.\n\nFinally, we compute $H$, which is the sum of the out-degrees of all nodes labeled as hubs.

The rank-$1$ structure of $A$ reveals a single cohesive regulatory module where the regulatory pattern of $\\mathrm{TF}_1$ defines the primary profile. The hub score of $\\mathrm{TF}_2$ is exactly half that of $\\mathrm{TF}_1$, directly reflecting that its regulatory strengths (row 2) are exactly half those of $\\mathrm{TF}_1$. This suggests $\\mathrm{TF}_2$ is a secondary co-regulator in the same module. $\\mathrm{TF}_3$'s hub score is $0$, which is correct as it does not regulate any genes in this network (row 3 is all zeros). A hub-like TF is a \"master regulator\" that coordinates the expression of a set of functionally related genes. $\\mathrm{TF}_1$ is the principal master regulator in this network.\n\nThe authority score of gene $g_1$ being the highest is also consistent. Column 1, corresponding to $g_1$, shows it receives the strongest regulatory inputs from the TFs (strengths $6$ and $3$). The authority scores in $v_1$ ($3/\\sqrt{14}, 1/\\sqrt{14}, 2/\\sqrt{14}$) reflect the relative importance of being a target in this regulatory module, which is defined by the vector $q = (3, 1, 2)^\\top$. Gene $g_1$ is the most significant target, followed by $g_3$, and then $g_2$. An authority-like gene is a key downstream target of master regulators. Its high score indicates it is a central component of the biological process controlled by this TF module.\n\nThe final numeric answer required is the exact value of the largest singular value, $\\sigma_1$. As computed above, this value is $\\sqrt{70}$.",
