            "problem": "Consider a deterministic synchronous Boolean network (BN) representing a coarse-grained gene regulatory module with two genes, whose binary states are denoted by $x_1 \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $x_2 \\in \\{0,1\\}$. The synchronous update map $F:\\{0,1\\}^2 \\to \\{0,1\\}^2$ is defined by $f_1=\\neg x_1$ and $f_2=x_1$, so that $F(x_1,x_2)=\\left(\\neg x_1,\\,x_1\\right)$. The state transition graph (STG) is formed by directed edges from each state $x$ to $F(x)$. An attractor is a minimal forward-invariant set under the iteration of $F$; attractors can be fixed points (period $1$) or limit cycles of period $p \\geq 2$.

No rounding is required and no units should be included in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The Boolean network consists of $2$ nodes, so the state space is $S = \\{0,1\\}^2$. The states are vectors $x = (x_1, x_2)$ where $x_1, x_2 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. There are $|S| = 2^2 = 4$ possible states: $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$, $(1,0)$, and $(1,1)$.\n\nThe synchronous update map is $F:\\{0,1\\}^2 \\to \\{0,1\\}^2$, defined by the component functions $f_1(x_1, x_2) = \\neg x_1$ and $f_2(x_1, x_2) = x_1$. Thus, the state $x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t))$ at time $t$ transitions to the state $x(t+1) = F(x(t))$ at time $t+1$, where $x(t+1) = (\\neg x_1(t), x_1(t))$. Note that the update rule for both components depends only on the state of the first gene, $x_1$.\n\nTo identify the attractors and their basins, we construct the State Transition Graph (STG) by enumerating the image of each state under $F$.\nThe four states and their transitions are:\n1.  For state $(0,0)$: $F(0,0) = (\\neg 0, 0) = (1,0)$.\n2.  For state $(0,1)$: $F(0,1) = (\\neg 0, 0) = (1,0)$.\n3.  For state $(1,0)$: $F(1,0) = (\\neg 1, 1) = (0,1)$.\n4.  For state $(1,1)$: $F(1,1) = (\\neg 1, 1) = (0,1)$.\n\nThe STG can be summarized by the following directed edges:\n$(0,0) \\to (1,0)$\n$(0,1) \\to (1,0)$\n$(1,0) \\to (0,1)$\n$(1,1) \\to (0,1)$\n\nFrom these transitions, we trace the dynamics. The states $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ map to each other: $F(1,0) = (0,1)$ and $F(0,1) = (1,0)$. This forms a limit cycle of period $p=2$. The set $A = \\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}$ is a minimal forward-invariant set, and is therefore an attractor.\nTo check for other attractors, such as fixed points, we would solve $F(x) = x$. This requires $(\\neg x_1, x_1) = (x_1, x_2)$. The first component, $\\neg x_1 = x_1$, has no solution for $x_1 \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. Thus, there are no fixed points. The limit cycle $A$ is the only attractor in the network.\n\nThe basin of an attractor is the set of states that enter it.\n- States $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are in the attractor $A$.\n- State $(0,0)$ transitions to $(1,0)$, which is in $A$.\n- State $(1,1)$ transitions to $(0,1)$, which is in $A$.\nSince all states in the state space $S$ either belong to $A$ or transition into $A$, the basin of the attractor $A$ is the entire state space $S = \\{(0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1)\\}$.\n\nNext, we compute the transient length $\\tau(x)$ for each initial state $x \\in S$. The transient length is the smallest non-negative integer $t$ such that $F^t(x)$ is in an attractor. Here, the attractor is $A = \\{(1,0), (0,1)\\}$.\n- For $x=(0,0)$: $F^0(0,0)=(0,0) \\notin A$. $F^1(0,0)=(1,0) \\in A$. The smallest such $t$ is $1$. So, $\\tau(0,0) = 1$.\n- For $x=(0,1)$: $F^0(0,1)=(0,1) \\in A$. The smallest such $t$ is $0$. So, $\\tau(0,1) = 0$.\n- For $x=(1,0)$: $F^0(1,0)=(1,0) \\in A$. The smallest such $t$ is $0$. So, $\\tau(1,0) = 0$.\n- For $x=(1,1)$: $F^0(1,1)=(1,1) \\notin A$. $F^1(1,1)=(0,1) \\in A$. The smallest such $t$ is $1$. So, $\\tau(1,1) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the expected transient length $L$, assuming a uniform distribution over the initial states. The probability of starting in any given state is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n$L = \\frac{1}{4} \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^2} \\tau(x)$\n$L = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\tau(0,0) + \\tau(0,1) + \\tau(1,0) + \\tau(1,1) \\right)$\n$L = \\frac{1}{4} (1 + 0 + 0 + 1)$\n$L = \\frac{1}{4} (2) = \\frac{2}{4}$\n\nAs a reduced fraction, the value is:\n$L = \\frac{1}{2}$",

This is an attractor of cycle length $1$.\nLet's trace other trajectories.\n-   Start with $(0,1,0)$: $(0,1,0) \\to (1,1,1) \\to (0,1,0)$. This is a limit cycle of length $2$. Let's call this attractor $A_2 = \\{(0,1,0), (1,1,1)\\}$.\n\nThe system has two attractors: a fixed point $A_1$ and a $2$-cycle $A_2$. Now we determine the basin of attraction for each. The basin of an attractor is the set of all states that eventually enter it.\n-   Basin of $A_1 = \\{(0,1,1)\\}$:\n    - The state $(0,1,1)$ is in its own basin.\n    - We check which states transition to $(0,1,1)$. From the list, $(1,0,1) \\to (0,1,1)$.\n    - The basin of attraction for $A_1$ is $B(A_1) = \\{(0,1,1), (1,0,1)\\}$.\n\n-   Basin of $A_2 = \\{(0,1,0), (1,1,1)\\}$:\n    - The states $(0,1,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$ are in their own basin.\n    - States that transition into the cycle:\n        - $(0,0,0) \\to (0,1,0)$\n        - $(0,0,1) \\to (0,1,0)$\n    - We trace the remaining states:\n        - $(1,0,0) \\to (0,0,1)$, which then leads into the cycle.\n        - $(1,1,0) \\to (1,0,0)$, which in turn leads into the cycle.\n    - Thus, the basin for $A_2$ consists of all other states: $B(A_2) = \\{(0,0,0), (0,0,1), (1,0,0), (1,1,0), (0,1,0), (1,1,1)\\}$.\nThe two basins are disjoint and their union covers the entire state space, as expected for a deterministic finite system. $|B(A_1)| + |B(A_2)| = 2 + 6 = 8$.\n\nNext, we compute the transient length for each initial state. The transient length is the number of steps required to first enter an attractor. States already within an attractor have a transient length of $0$.\nLet $T(x)$ be the transient length of state $x$.\n\n-   $x = (0,1,1) \\in A_1$: $T(0,1,1) = 0$.\n-   $x = (0,1,0) \\in A_2$: $T(0,1,0) = 0$.\n-   $x = (1,1,1) \\in A_2$: $T(1,1,1) = 0$.\n\n-   $x = (1,0,1)$: $(1,0,1) \\to (0,1,1) \\in A_1$. This takes $1$ step. $T(1,0,1) = 1$.\n-   $x = (0,0,0)$: $(0,0,0) \\to (0,1,0) \\in A_2$. This takes $1$ step. $T(0,0,0) = 1$.\n-   $x = (0,0,1)$: $(0,0,1) \\to (0,1,0) \\in A_2$. This takes $1$ step. $T(0,0,1) = 1$.\n\n-   $x = (1,0,0)$: $(1,0,0) \\to (0,0,1) \\to (0,1,0) \\in A_2$. This takes $2$ steps. $T(1,0,0) = 2$.\n\n-   $x = (1,1,0)$: $(1,1,0) \\to (1,0,0) \\to (0,0,1) \\to (0,1,0) \\in A_2$. This takes $3$ steps. $T(1,1,0) = 3$.\n\nSummary of transient lengths for all $8$ states:\n-   $T(0,0,0) = 1$\n-   $T(0,0,1) = 1$\n-   $T(0,1,0) = 0$\n-   $T(0,1,1) = 0$\n-   $T(1,0,0) = 2$\n-   $T(1,0,1) = 1$\n-   $T(1,1,0) = 3$\n-   $T(1,1,1) = 0$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected transient length, assuming a uniformly random initial state. This means each state $x$ has a probability $P(x) = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe expected transient length $\\mathbb{E}[T]$ is the average of the transient lengths over the entire state space:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^3} T(x) P(x) = \\frac{1}{8} \\sum_{x \\in \\{0,1\\}^3} T(x)\n$$\nWe sum the calculated transient lengths:\n$$\n\\sum T(x) = T(0,0,0) + T(0,0,1) + T(0,1,0) + T(0,1,1) + T(1,0,0) + T(1,0,1) + T(1,1,0) + T(1,1,1)\n$$\n$$\n\\sum T(x) = 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 0 = 8\n$$\nThe expected transient length is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 8 = 1\n$$\nThe expected number of synchronous updates required to enter an attractor, starting from a uniformly random state, is $1$.",
