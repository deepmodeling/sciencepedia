A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to determine the S-phase population fraction, $a_S$, from the given model and data. The model for the probability density $f(x)$ is:\n$$f(x) = a_{G1}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(x-2) + a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(x) + a_{G2}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(x-4)$$\nWe are given three data points, which yield a system of three linear equations for the unknown fractions $a_{G1}$, $a_S$, and $a_ {G2}$:\n$1$. $f(2) = 1.696 = a_{G1}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(2-2) + a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(2) + a_{G2}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(2-4)$\n$2$. $f(3) = 0.2000 = a_{G1}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(3-2) + a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(3) + a_{G2}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(3-4)$\n$3$. $f(4) = 0.8978 = a_{G1}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(4-2) + a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(4) + a_{G2}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(4-4)$\n\nThe most direct path to finding $a_S$ is to analyze the equation at $x=3$, which is the midpoint of the S-phase's DNA content range. The reasoning is that the contributions from the G1 and G2/M peaks, centered at $x=2$ and $x=4$ respectively, will be minimal at this midpoint, given the small value of $\\sigma$.\n\nLet's examine the equation for $f(3)$:\n$$f(3) = a_{G1}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(1) + a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(3) + a_{G2}\\,\\phi_{\\sigma}(-1)$$\nThe Gaussian PDF $\\phi_{\\sigma}(z)$ is given by $\\phi_{\\sigma}(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-\\frac{z^2}{2\\sigma^2})$. With the given $\\sigma = 0.10$, the argument of the exponential becomes $-\\frac{z^2}{2(0.1)^2} = -50z^2$.\nThe terms $\\phi_{\\sigma}(1)$ and $\\phi_{\\sigma}(-1)$ are:\n$$\\phi_{\\sigma}(1) = \\phi_{\\sigma}(-1) = \\frac{1}{0.1\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-50 \\cdot 1^2) = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-50)$$\nThe value of $\\exp(-50)$ is approximately $1.9 \\times 10^{-22}$. This is an exceptionally small number. Since $a_{G1}$ and $a_{G2}$ are fractions (i.e., $0 \\le a_{G1}, a_{G2} \\le 1$), the products $a_{G1}\\phi_{\\sigma}(1)$ and $a_{G2}\\phi_{\\sigma}(-1)$ are negligible and can be confidently approximated as zero relative to the precision of the data provided.\n\nThis simplifies the equation for $f(3)$ considerably:\n$$f(3) \\approx a_{S}\\,g_{\\sigma}(3)$$\nWe are given $f(3) = 0.2000$. To solve for $a_S$, we need to calculate $g_{\\sigma}(3)$. The definition of $g_{\\sigma}(x)$ is:\n$$g_{\\sigma}(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{x-2}{\\sigma}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{x-4}{\\sigma}\\right) \\right]$$\nSubstituting $x=3$ and $\\sigma=0.10$:\n$$g_{\\sigma}(3) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\Phi\\left(\\frac{3-2}{0.1}\\right) - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{3-4}{0.1}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\Phi(10) - \\Phi(-10) \\right]$$\nHere, $\\Phi(z)$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. For a large positive argument $z$, $\\Phi(z)$ approaches $1$. For a large negative argument, $\\Phi(z)$ approaches $0$. The value $z=10$ is more than $10$ standard deviations from the mean, so $\\Phi(10)$ is extremely close to $1$, and $\\Phi(-10)$ is extremely close to $0$.\nSpecifically, we know that $\\Phi(z) + \\Phi(-z) = 1$. Therefore, $\\Phi(-10) = 1 - \\Phi(10)$.\n$$g_{\\sigma}(3) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\Phi(10) - (1 - \\Phi(10))] = \\Phi(10) - \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe tail probability $1 - \\Phi(10)$ is on the order of $10^{-23}$, which is insignificant for this problem. Thus, we can approximate $\\Phi(10) \\approx 1$, which gives:\n$$g_{\\sigma}(3) \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\nThe approximation is highly accurate. Using this value, we can now solve for $a_S$:\n$$0.2000 \\approx a_{S} \\times 0.5$$\n$$a_{S} \\approx \\frac{0.2000}{0.5} = 0.4000$$\nThe question asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Our result is already in this form. The S-phase fraction $a_S$ is inferred to be $0.4000$.\n\nTo ensure consistency, we can briefly check the other data points.\n$g_{\\sigma}(2) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\Phi(0) - \\Phi(-20)] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}[0.5 - 0] = 0.25$.\n$g_{\\sigma}(4) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\Phi(20) - \\Phi(0)] \\approx \\frac{1}{2}[1 - 0.5] = 0.25$.\n$\\phi_{\\sigma}(0) = \\frac{1}{0.1\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\approx 3.9894$.\nFrom $f(2) = 1.696 \\approx a_{G1}\\phi_{\\sigma}(0) + a_S g_{\\sigma}(2)$, we get $1.696 \\approx a_{G1}(3.9894) + (0.4000)(0.25)$, which gives $a_{G1} \\approx \\frac{1.696-0.1}{3.9894} \\approx 0.4000$.\nFrom $f(4) = 0.8978 \\approx a_S g_{\\sigma}(4) + a_{G2}\\phi_{\\sigma}(0)$, we get $0.8978 \\approx (0.4000)(0.25) + a_{G2}(3.9894)$, which gives $a_{G2} \\approx \\frac{0.8978-0.1}{3.9894} \\approx 0.2000$.\nThe sum $a_{G1} + a_S + a_{G2} \\approx 0.4000 + 0.4000 + 0.2000 = 1.0000$, which satisfies the constraint $a_{G1}+a_S+a_{G2}=1$. The entire dataset is consistent with the derived value of $a_S$.",

These are fundamental tools in the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It requires finding a single parameter, $\\alpha$, that satisfies a specific condition at a given time. This involves solving a linear ODE, which has a unique solution given the initial condition, and then solving an algebraic equation.

A complete solution will now be derived.\n\nThe objective is to determine the arrest duration, $t^{\\ast}$, which is the time at which the relative CDK activity, $\\dfrac{V_{\\text{CDK}}(t)}{V_{\\max}}$, first reaches the threshold value $\\theta$. We begin by setting up the equation that defines this condition:\n$$\n\\dfrac{V_{\\text{CDK}}(t^{\\ast})}{V_{\\max}} = \\theta\n$$\nWe are given the Hill function model for CDK activity. Substituting this into our condition gives:\n$$\n\\dfrac{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n}}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} + K^{n}} = \\theta\n$$\nOur first step is to solve this equation for the active fraction of Cdc25, $f_{a}(t^{\\ast})$, at the moment of arrest release.\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} = \\theta (f_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} + K^{n})\n$$\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} = \\theta f_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} + \\theta K^{n}\n$$\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} (1 - \\theta) = \\theta K^{n}\n$$\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast})^{n} = \\dfrac{\\theta K^{n}}{1 - \\theta}\n$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides, we find the required active fraction of Cdc25:\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast}) = K \\left( \\dfrac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\right)^{1/n}\n$$\nNext, we relate this active fraction of Cdc25 to the activity of Chk1, $A(t^{\\ast})$, using the provided quasi-steady-state expression for $f_{a}(t)$:\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{k_{u}}{k_{p} A(t^{\\ast}) + k_{u}}\n$$\nWe rearrange this equation to solve for $A(t^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nk_{p} A(t^{\\ast}) + k_{u} = \\dfrac{k_{u}}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}\n$$\n$$\nk_{p} A(t^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{k_{u}}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} - k_{u} = k_{u} \\left( \\dfrac{1 - f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nA(t^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{k_{u}}{k_{p}} \\left( \\dfrac{1 - f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we use the model for the exponential decay of Chk1 activity, $A(t) = A_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t)$. First, we must determine the decay constant $k_d$ from the given half-life, $t_{1/2}$. By definition of half-life, $A(t_{1/2}) = A_0/2$.\n$$\nA_0 \\exp(-k_d t_{1/2}) = \\frac{A_0}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\exp(-k_d t_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-k_d t_{1/2} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2)\n$$\n$$\nk_d = \\dfrac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\n$$\nFinally, we set the expression for $A(t^{\\ast})$ from the Chk1 decay model equal to the expression we derived from the Cdc25 equilibrium:\n$$\nA_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{k_u}{k_p} \\left( \\dfrac{1 - f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right)\n$$\nWe solve for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\exp(-k_{d} t^{\\ast}) = \\dfrac{k_u}{A_0 k_p} \\left( \\dfrac{1 - f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n-k_d t^{\\ast} = \\ln\\left( \\dfrac{k_u}{A_0 k_p} \\left( \\dfrac{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nt^{\\ast} = -\\dfrac{1}{k_d} \\ln\\left( \\dfrac{k_u}{A_0 k_p} \\left( \\dfrac{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right) \\right) = \\dfrac{1}{k_d} \\ln\\left( \\dfrac{A_0 k_p}{k_u} \\left( \\dfrac{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k_d$ and $f_a(t^*)$:\n$$\nt^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{t_{1/2}}{\\ln(2)} \\ln\\left( \\dfrac{A_0 k_p}{k_u} \\dfrac{K \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\right)^{1/n}}{1 - K \\left( \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\theta} \\right)^{1/n}} \\right)\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $t_{1/2} = 1.5$ h, $A_0 = 3.0$ a.u., $k_p = 0.6$ h$^{-1}$ a.u.$^{-1}$, $k_u = 0.3$ h$^{-1}$, $n = 4$, $K = 0.35$, and $\\theta = 0.8$.\n\nFirst, calculate the required active Cdc25 fraction, $f_{a}(t^{\\ast})$:\n$$\nf_{a}(t^{\\ast}) = 0.35 \\left( \\dfrac{0.8}{1 - 0.8} \\right)^{1/4} = 0.35 \\left( \\dfrac{0.8}{0.2} \\right)^{1/4} = 0.35 \\times (4)^{1/4} = 0.35 \\times \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$f_{a}(t^{\\ast}) \\approx 0.35 \\times 1.41421356 \\approx 0.49497475$\n\nNext, calculate the argument of the logarithm in the expression for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\dfrac{A_0 k_p}{k_u} = \\dfrac{3.0 \\times 0.6}{0.3} = \\dfrac{1.8}{0.3} = 6.0\n$$\n$$\n\\dfrac{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} = \\dfrac{0.49497475}{1 - 0.49497475} = \\dfrac{0.49497475}{0.50502525} \\approx 0.98010\n$$\nThe full argument is: $6.0 \\times 0.98010 = 5.8806$.\nLet's re-calculate using the exact expression for precision:\n$$\n\\dfrac{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} = \\dfrac{0.35\\sqrt{2}}{1-0.35\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nArgument of logarithm:\n$$\n\\dfrac{A_0 k_p}{k_u} \\dfrac{f_{a}(t^{\\ast})}{1-f_{a}(t^{\\ast})} = 6.0 \\times \\dfrac{0.35\\sqrt{2}}{1-0.35\\sqrt{2}} = \\dfrac{2.1\\sqrt{2}}{1-0.35\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\approx \\dfrac{2.1 \\times 1.41421356}{1 - 0.35 \\times 1.41421356} = \\dfrac{2.96984848}{1 - 0.49497475} = \\dfrac{2.96984848}{0.50502525} \\approx 5.88053\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the equation for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nt^{\\ast} = \\dfrac{1.5}{\\ln(2)} \\ln(5.88053) \\approx \\dfrac{1.5}{0.693147} \\times 1.77168 \\approx 2.16404 \\times 1.77168 \\approx 3.83415 \\text{ h}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$\nt^{\\ast} \\approx 3.834 \\text{ h}\n$$",
