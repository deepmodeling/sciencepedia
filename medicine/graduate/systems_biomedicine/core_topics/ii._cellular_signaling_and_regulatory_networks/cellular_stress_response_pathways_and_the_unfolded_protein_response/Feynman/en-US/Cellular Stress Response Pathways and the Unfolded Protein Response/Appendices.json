By modeling the competitive binding interactions between the chaperone BiP, the sensor IRE1, and unfolded client proteins, we can derive the activation profile of a key UPR pathway from first principles of chemical equilibrium. This exercise () demonstrates how complex biological switching behavior can emerge from simple molecular competition.",

            "problem": "Consider the endoplasmic reticulum branch of the unfolded protein response, in which Binding Immunoglobulin Protein (BiP; also known as Heat Shock Protein Family A Member 5) binds the luminal domain of Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) to repress its activity, and competes with BiP binding to an unfolded client protein. Assume the following mechanistic and thermodynamic base: (i) single-site, one-to-one binding between BiP and IRE1, and between BiP and the unfolded client; (ii) quasi-equilibrium governed by mass-action; (iii) IRE1 is considered active only when not bound by BiP (ignore subsequent oligomerization or kinase/RNase activation steps for the purpose of this calculation). Let the dissociation constants be $K_{d1}$ for the BiP–IRE1 complex and $K_{d2}$ for the BiP–client complex, with total concentrations $B_{T}$ for BiP, $R_{T}$ for IRE1, and $U_{T}$ for the unfolded client. Using only mass conservation and the law of mass action, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the fraction of IRE1 in the active state, defined as $f \\equiv \\frac{[R]}{R_{T}}$ where $[R]$ is free IRE1, as a function of $K_{d1}$, $K_{d2}$, $B_{T}$, $R_{T}$, and $U_{T}$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical approximation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for a closed-form analytic expression for the fraction of active IRE1, denoted by $f$, which is defined as the ratio of the concentration of free IRE1, $[R]$, to the total concentration of IRE1, $R_{T}$. The system is composed of Binding Immunoglobulin Protein (BiP), Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), and an unfolded client protein, which we will denote as $B$, $R$, and $U$ respectively.\n\nThe system is assumed to be at quasi-equilibrium and is governed by the principles of mass action and mass conservation. The interactions are:\n1.  Reversible binding of BiP to IRE1: $B + R \\rightleftharpoons BR$.\n2.  Reversible binding of BiP to the unfolded client: $B + U \\rightleftharpoons BU$.\n\nFrom the law of mass action for these one-to-one binding equilibria, we can write the expressions for the dissociation constants, $K_{d1}$ for the BiP-IRE1 complex ($BR$) and $K_{d2}$ for the BiP-client complex ($BU$):\n$$K_{d1} = \\frac{[B][R]}{[BR]}$$\n$$K_{d2} = \\frac{[B][U]}{[BU]}$$\nwhere $[X]$ denotes the concentration of species $X$ at equilibrium.\n\nThe total concentrations of BiP ($B_T$), IRE1 ($R_T$), and the unfolded client ($U_T$) are conserved. This gives us three mass balance equations:\n$$B_T = [B] + [BR] + [BU]$$\n$$R_T = [R] + [BR]$$\n$$U_T = [U] + [BU]$$\n\nOur goal is to find $f \\equiv \\frac{[R]}{R_T}$. We can express the concentrations of all species in terms of the free concentrations and total concentrations.\nFrom the definition of $f$, we have $[R] = f R_T$.\nUsing the mass balance for IRE1, we can express the concentration of the BiP-IRE1 complex, $[BR]$, in terms of $f$:\n$$[BR] = R_T - [R] = R_T - f R_T = R_T(1-f)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $K_{d1}$:\n$$K_{d1} = \\frac{[B](f R_T)}{R_T(1-f)} = \\frac{[B]f}{1-f}$$\nThis allows us to express the free BiP concentration, $[B]$, as a function of $f$:\n$$[B] = K_{d1} \\frac{1-f}{f}$$\n\nNext, we express the concentration of the BiP-client complex, $[BU]$, in terms of $[B]$. From the mass balance for the client and the expression for $K_{d2}$:\n$$[U] = U_T - [BU]$$\n$$K_{d2} = \\frac{[B](U_T - [BU])}{[BU]}$$\nRearranging to solve for $[BU]$:\n$$K_{d2}[BU] = [B]U_T - [B][BU]$$\n$$[BU](K_{d2} + [B]) = [B]U_T$$\n$$[BU] = \\frac{U_T [B]}{[B] + K_{d2}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the expressions for $[BR]$ and $[BU]$ into the mass balance equation for BiP:\n$$B_T = [B] + R_T(1-f) + \\frac{U_T [B]}{[B] + K_{d2}}$$\nWe have a system of two equations with two variables, $[B]$ and $f$:\n1.  $[B] = K_{d1} \\frac{1-f}{f}$\n2.  $B_T = [B] + R_T(1-f) + \\frac{U_T [B]}{[B] + K_{d2}}$\n\nTo solve for $f$, we can first solve for $[B]$ in terms of the known total concentrations and dissociation constants. From equation (1), we can see that $f = \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + [B]}$. Thus, finding $[B]$ is sufficient.\nLet's substitute the expressions for $f$ and $1-f$ in terms of $[B]$ into the second equation.\nFrom $f = \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + [B]}$, we have $1-f = 1 - \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + [B]} = \\frac{[B]}{K_{d1} + [B]}$.\nSubstituting this into the BiP mass balance equation:\n$$B_T = [B] + R_T \\left(\\frac{[B]}{K_{d1} + [B]}\\right) + \\frac{U_T [B]}{[B] + K_{d2}}$$\nThis is an equation for the single unknown variable $[B]$. To solve it, we can clear the denominators by multiplying all terms by $([B] + K_{d1})([B] + K_{d2})$. Let $x = [B]$ for notational simplicity:\n$$B_T(x + K_{d1})(x + K_{d2}) = x(x + K_{d1})(x + K_{d2}) + R_T x(x + K_{d2}) + U_T x(x + K_{d1})$$\nExpanding the polynomial products:\n$$B_T(x^2 + (K_{d1}+K_{d2})x + K_{d1}K_{d2}) = x(x^2 + (K_{d1}+K_{d2})x + K_{d1}K_{d2}) + R_T(x^2+K_{d2}x) + U_T(x^2+K_{d1}x)$$\nRearranging into the standard form of a cubic equation, $A'x^3 + B'x^2 + C'x + D' = 0$:\n$$x^3 + (K_{d1}+K_{d2}+R_T+U_T-B_T)x^2 + (K_{d1}K_{d2}+R_TK_{d2}+U_TK_{d1}-B_T(K_{d1}+K_{d2}))x - B_TK_{d1}K_{d2} = 0$$\nThis is a monic cubic equation of the form $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, with coefficients:\n$$a = K_{d1} + K_{d2} + R_T + U_T - B_T$$\n$$b = K_{d1}K_{d2} + R_T K_{d2} + U_T K_{d1} - B_T(K_{d1}+K_{d2})$$\n$$c = -B_T K_{d1}K_{d2}$$\nBased on physical principles, there must be a unique, non-negative real solution for the concentration $[B]$. At $[B]=0$, the left side of the original equation for $B_T$ is $0$, which is less than $B_T$. The left side is a monotonically increasing function of $[B]$ for $[B] \\ge 0$. Therefore, a unique positive real root for $[B]$ exists. This root can be found analytically using Cardano's formula.\n\nTo solve the cubic equation, we perform a substitution $x = y - a/3$ to obtain the depressed cubic $y^3 + py + q = 0$, where:\n$$p = b - \\frac{a^2}{3}$$\n$$q = c + \\frac{2a^3 - 9ab}{27}$$\nThe real solution for $y$ is given by:\n$$y = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{q}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{q}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^3}} + \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{q}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{q}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{p}{3}\\right)^3}}$$\nThe unique physical solution for the free BiP concentration is then $[B] = x = y - a/3$.\n\nFinally, the fraction of active IRE1, $f$, is given by:\n$$f = \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + [B]} = \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + y - a/3}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $y$, $p$, $q$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ yields the full closed-form analytical expression for $f$ as a function of the given parameters. The final answer requires substituting these definitions.\nLet $\\mathcal{A} = K_{d1} + K_{d2} + R_T + U_T - B_T$.\nLet $\\mathcal{B} = K_{d1}K_{d2} + R_T K_{d2} + U_T K_{d1} - B_T(K_{d1}+K_{d2})$.\nLet $\\mathcal{C} = -B_T K_{d1}K_{d2}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{P} = \\mathcal{B} - \\frac{\\mathcal{A}^2}{3}$.\nLet $\\mathcal{Q} = \\mathcal{C} + \\frac{2\\mathcal{A}^3 - 9\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}}{27}$.\nThe unique positive real root for $[B]$ is:\n$$[B] = \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}}{2} + \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{P}}{3}\\right)^3}} + \\sqrt[3]{-\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}}{2} - \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{P}}{3}\\right)^3}} - \\frac{\\mathcal{A}}{3}$$\nThe requested fraction is $f = \\frac{K_{d1}}{K_{d1} + [B]}$.",

This practice delves into one of the most elegant mechanisms of the UPR: the translational reprogramming of the transcription factor ATF4.

This exercise highlights the sophisticated logic encoded in mRNA sequences.",

            "problem": "Cells mount the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) to endoplasmic reticulum stress, in part by translational reprogramming mediated by phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α). Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) is a canonical UPR effector whose main open reading frame (ORF) translation is controlled by two upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in its $5^{\\prime}$ leader. In the canonical scanning model of eukaryotic translation initiation, scanning preinitiation complexes decode start codons in a $5^{\\prime}$ to $3^{\\prime}$ manner, initiating when a start codon is recognized with an available ternary complex. After terminating translation of a short uORF, a ribosome may resume scanning and, once it reacquires a ternary complex, reinitiate at the next start codon it encounters.\n\nConsider a simplified event-tree model of ATF4 translation with the following assumptions grounded in the scanning and reinitiation framework:\n- Each scanning preinitiation complex that arrives at the ATF4 $5^{\\prime}$ leader either initiates at uORF1 with probability $p_{1}$ or bypasses it. The contribution of ribosomes that bypass uORF1 to main ORF initiation is negligible because the inhibitory uORF2 has strong start codon context and captures these ribosomes. You may therefore ignore main ORF initiation from the bypassing branch.\n- Conditional on having translated uORF1, a ribosome may reinitiate at uORF2 with probability $f_{2}$. If it reinitiates at uORF2, it does not initiate at the main ORF on that pass. If it does not reinitiate at uORF2, it is assumed to reinitiate at the main ORF with probability $1$ upon encountering the main start codon.\n- Drop-off between stops and starts and any contribution from leaky scanning at the main ORF are negligible.\n\nEmpirical ribosome profiling under two conditions provides the following measurements:\n- Low eIF2α phosphorylation (basal): $p_{1,\\mathrm{low}} = 0.90$, and among ribosomes that translated uORF1, $f_{2,\\mathrm{low}} = 0.80$.\n- High eIF2α phosphorylation (UPR-activated): $p_{1,\\mathrm{high}} = 0.85$, and among ribosomes that translated uORF1, $f_{2,\\mathrm{high}} = 0.30$.\n\nUsing only the definitions of conditional probability and the scanning/reinitiation model assumptions above, compute the fold-change in the steady-state rate of main ORF initiation at high versus low eIF2α phosphorylation, defined as\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\text{main ORF initiation probability per scanning complex at high}}{\\text{main ORF initiation probability per scanning complex at low}}.\n$$\nExpress your final answer as an exact fraction.

We will denote this probability as $P(\\text{main ORF initiation})$. This calculation must be performed for both the low and high eIF2α phosphorylation conditions.\n\nAccording to the model, for main ORF initiation to occur, a specific sequence of events must take place. Let us trace this path using the provided probabilities:\n1.  A scanning complex must first initiate translation at uORF1. The probability of this event is $p_1$. The alternative path, bypassing uORF1, is assumed to not lead to main ORF initiation and is therefore ignored. Thus, initiation at uORF1 is a necessary prerequisite.\n2.  After translating uORF1, the ribosome resumes scanning. It then encounters the start codon of uORF2. The problem states that the ribosome may reinitiate at uORF2 with a conditional probability of $f_2$. This event precludes main ORF initiation.\n3.  For main ORF initiation to be possible, the ribosome must *not* reinitiate at uORF2. The probability of this event, conditional on having translated uORF1, is the complement of reinitiating at uORF2, which is $1 - f_2$.\n4.  If the ribosome successfully translates uORF1 and subsequently does not reinitiate at uORF2, the problem states it will reinitiate at the main ORF with a probability of $1$.\n\nThe overall probability of main ORF initiation is the product of the probabilities of these sequential events. Let $P(M)$ be the probability of main ORF initiation per scanning complex.\n\nThe sequence of events for successful main ORF initiation is:\n(Initiate at uORF1) AND (Do not reinitiate at uORF2 | Initiated at uORF1) AND (Initiate at main ORF | Did not reinitiate at uORF2).\n\nThe probability is the product of the probabilities of these steps:\n$$P(M) = p_1 \\times (1 - f_2) \\times 1$$\n$$P(M) = p_1(1 - f_2)$$\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two given conditions.\n\n**1.
