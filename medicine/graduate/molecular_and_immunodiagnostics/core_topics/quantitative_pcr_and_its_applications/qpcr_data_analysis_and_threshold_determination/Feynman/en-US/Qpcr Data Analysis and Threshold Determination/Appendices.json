            "problem": "A single amplicon was quantified using quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) on a real-time thermocycler that records raw fluorescence per cycle. Fluorescence is proportional to double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid concentration plus instrument noise, which in the baseline phase is well-approximated by additive Gaussian noise with cycle-independent variance. In the exponential phase, the amplicon concentration grows multiplicatively per cycle, so that on the natural-logarithm scale the fluorescence becomes approximately linear in cycle number with a positive slope. The quantification cycle ($C_q$) is defined as the cycle index at which the fluorescence signal crosses a fixed analytical threshold in the exponential phase, determined relative to the baseline.\n\nYou are given raw fluorescence readings (arbitrary units) for cycles $c = 1, 2, \\dots, 20$ for a single target:\n$49.8$, $50.5$, $50.1$, $49.7$, $50.3$, $49.9$, $50.4$, $50.0$, $49.6$, $50.2$, $50.1$, $52.0$, $56.5$, $64.0$, $76.5$, $95.0$, $120.0$, $150.0$, $190.0$, $240.0$.\n\nStarting from the baseline/exponential-phase definitions above and the Gaussian-noise assumption, use a principled change-point detection argument on the sequence of natural-log fluorescence values to identify the earliest cycle $c^{*}$ at which the process transitions from baseline (approximately zero slope on the log scale) to exponential growth (positive constant slope on the log scale). Upon identifying $c^{*}$, update the baseline window to be cycles $1$ through $c^{*} - 1$ and compute the baseline sample mean $\\mu_b$ and baseline sample standard deviation $\\sigma_b$ of the raw fluorescence values in this window.\n\nDefine the analytical threshold $\\tau$ as $\\tau = \\mu_b + k \\sigma_b$ with $k = 6$. Compute $C_q$ by locating the first two consecutive cycles $(c_-, c_+)$ whose raw fluorescence values straddle $\\tau$, and then performing linear interpolation on the natural-logarithm scale between cycles $c_-$ and $c_+$:\n$$\nC_q \\equiv c_- + \\frac{\\ln(\\tau) - \\ln(F_{c_-})}{\\ln(F_{c_+}) - \\ln(F_{c_-})},\n$$\nwhere $F_{c}$ denotes the raw fluorescence at cycle $c$.\n\nReport the final $C_q$ in cycles.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the quantification cycle, $C_q$, from a given set of quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) fluorescence data. The procedure involves several steps as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we are given the raw fluorescence readings, $F_c$, for cycles $c = 1, 2, \\dots, 20$:\n$\\{49.8, 50.5, 50.1, 49.7, 50.3, 49.9, 50.4, 50.0, 49.6, 50.2, 50.1, 52.0, 56.5, 64.0, 76.5, 95.0, 120.0, 150.0, 190.0, 240.0\\}$.\n\nThe second step is to identify the earliest cycle, $c^*$, where the amplification process transitions from the baseline phase to the exponential growth phase. The problem states that this transition is characterized by a change in the slope of the natural logarithm of fluorescence, $y_c = \\ln(F_c)$, from approximately zero to a positive constant. A principled method for detecting this change-point is to examine the first-order differences of the log-fluorescence sequence, $\\Delta y_c = y_{c+1} - y_c$, which serve as a discrete approximation of the derivative.\nLet's calculate these differences:\n$\\Delta y_1 = \\ln(50.5) - \\ln(49.8) \\approx 0.0140$\n$\\Delta y_2 = \\ln(50.1) - \\ln(50.5) \\approx -0.0079$\n$\\Delta y_3 = \\ln(49.7) - \\ln(50.1) \\approx -0.0080$\n$\\Delta y_4 = \\ln(50.3) - \\ln(49.7) \\approx 0.0120$\n$\\Delta y_5 = \\ln(49.9) - \\ln(50.3) \\approx -0.0080$\n$\\Delta y_6 = \\ln(50.4) - \\ln(49.9) \\approx 0.0100$\n$\\Delta y_7 = \\ln(50.0) - \\ln(50.4) \\approx -0.0080$\n$\\Delta y_8 = \\ln(49.6) - \\ln(50.0) \\approx -0.0080$\n$\\Delta y_9 = \\ln(50.2) - \\ln(49.6) \\approx 0.0120$\n$\\Delta y_{10} = \\ln(50.1) - \\ln(50.2) \\approx -0.0020$\n$\\Delta y_{11} = \\ln(52.0) - \\ln(50.1) \\approx 0.0372$\n$\\Delta y_{12} = \\ln(56.5) - \\ln(52.0) \\approx 0.0830$\nThe differences for cycles $c=1$ through $c=10$ are small and fluctuate around zero, consistent with the baseline definition. The difference $\\Delta y_{11}$ is the first to show a distinct positive value that marks the start of a sustained increase. Thus, the exponential phase begins at cycle $c=12$. The earliest cycle of this phase is $c^{*} = 12$.\n\nThe baseline window is defined as cycles $1$ through $c^{*} - 1$, which corresponds to cycles $1$ through $11$. We use the raw fluorescence values in this window, $F_{1..11}$, to compute the baseline sample mean, $\\mu_b$, and sample standard deviation, $\\sigma_b$. The number of data points in the baseline is $n=11$.\nThe sample mean is:\n$$ \\mu_b = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} F_i = \\frac{1}{11} (49.8+50.5+50.1+49.7+50.3+49.9+50.4+50.0+49.6+50.2+50.1) = \\frac{550.6}{11} $$\n$$ \\mu_b \\approx 50.054545... $$\nThe sample variance, $\\sigma_b^2$, is calculated using the formula for an unbiased estimator:\n$$ \\sigma_b^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (F_i - \\mu_b)^2 = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{11} F_i^2 - \\frac{(\\sum_{i=1}^{11} F_i)^2}{11} \\right) $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{11} F_i^2 = 27560.86 $$\n$$ \\sigma_b^2 = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 27560.86 - \\frac{(550.6)^2}{11} \\right) = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( 27560.86 - 27560.032727... \\right) \\approx 0.082727... $$\nThe sample standard deviation is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_b = \\sqrt{\\sigma_b^2} \\approx \\sqrt{0.082727...} \\approx 0.287623... $$\n\nNext, we calculate the analytical threshold $\\tau$ using the formula $\\tau = \\mu_b + k \\sigma_b$, with the given constant $k = 6$.\n$$ \\tau = 50.054545... + 6 \\times (0.287623...) \\approx 50.054545... + 1.725740... \\approx 51.780286... $$\n\nNow, we identify the first pair of consecutive cycles, $(c_-, c_+)$, where the raw fluorescence values $F_{c_-}$ and $F_{c_+}$ straddle the threshold $\\tau \\approx 51.78$.

The assay is multiplexed with a housekeeping gene (reference) to normalize input variation. The cycle threshold ($C_t$) is defined as the smallest cycle $c$ at which the baseline-corrected fluorescence, proportional to amplicon copy number $N(c)$, crosses a fixed threshold within the exponential phase of amplification. The following $C_t$ values were obtained under a single, validated threshold:\n\n- Target in the patient sample: $C_{t,\\text{target,sample}} = 24.10$\n- Target in the calibrator: $C_{t,\\text{target,cal}} = 26.85$\n- Reference in the patient sample: $C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}} = 19.40$\n- Reference in the calibrator: $C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} = 19.95$\n\nA standard curve generated from a five-point ten-fold serial dilution (covering $5$ orders of magnitude in input template amount) yields a linear regression of $C_t$ versus $\\log_{10}$ input with slope $s = -3.50$ for the pooled assay conditions.

Express the fold change as a pure number (dimensionless).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the efficiency-adjusted fold change in gene expression from quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) data. The process begins with the fundamental model of PCR amplification and proceeds to the specific formula for relative quantification.\n\n**Step 1: The Model of Exponential Amplification**\nThe number of copies of a specific DNA sequence, $N(c)$, after $c$ cycles of PCR, can be modeled as an exponential growth process:\n$$N(c) = N_0 E^c$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of target molecules, and E is the per-cycle amplification factor. A factor of E=2 represents a perfect doubling of the product in each cycle.\n\n**Step 2: The Cycle Threshold ($C_t$)**\nThe cycle threshold, $C_t$, is defined as the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal, which is proportional to $N(c)$, crosses a predetermined threshold. Let the amplicon copy number at this threshold be $N_T$. At $c = C_t$, the equation becomes:\n$$N_T = N_0 E^{C_t}$$\nSince $N_T$ and $E$ are constant for a given assay, we can rearrange this equation to express the initial template quantity $N_0$ as a function of $C_t$:\n$$N_0 = N_T E^{-C_t}$$\nThis shows that the initial quantity of template, $N_0$, is inversely proportional to an exponential function of the $C_t$ value. A higher initial amount $N_0$ will require fewer cycles to reach the threshold, resulting in a lower $C_t$.\n\n**Step 3: Determination of Amplification Factor (E) from the Standard Curve**\nA standard curve is generated by plotting $C_t$ values against the logarithm of known initial template quantities. We can derive the relationship by taking the logarithm (base $10$) of the equation $N_T = N_0 E^{C_t}$:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_T) = \\log_{10}(N_0 E^{C_t}) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + C_t \\log_{10}(E)$$\nRearranging to solve for $C_t$ gives a linear equation in the form of $y = mx + b$:\n$$C_t = \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(E)}\\right) \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(E)}$$\nThe slope $s$ of the $C_t$ versus $\\log_{10}(\\text{input})$ plot is therefore given by $s = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(E)}$.\nThe problem provides a pooled slope of $s = -3.50$. We can use this to calculate the amplification factor E:\n$$s = -3.50 = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(E)}$$\n$$\\log_{10}(E) = \\frac{1}{3.50} = \\frac{1}{7/2} = \\frac{2}{7}$$\n$$E = 10^{2/7}$$\n\n**Step 4: Derivation of the Efficiency-Adjusted Fold Change Expression**\nThe goal is to determine the fold change of the target gene's expression in the patient sample relative to the calibrator, normalized by a reference (housekeeping) gene. This fold change is the Relative Quantification value, $RQ$.\n$$RQ = \\frac{(\\text{Normalized Target Abundance})_{\\text{sample}}}{(\\text{Normalized Target Abundance})_{\\text{cal}}}$$\nThe normalized abundance in any given sample (or calibrator) is the ratio of the initial amount of the target gene to the initial amount of the reference gene:\n$$(\\text{Normalized Abundance}) = \\frac{N_{0,\\text{target}}}{N_{0,\\text{ref}}}$$\nUsing the relationship $N_0 = N_T E^{-C_t}$ and assuming the threshold $N_T$ is the same for all reactions, we can substitute for the initial amounts:\n$$(\\text{Normalized Abundance}) \\propto \\frac{E_{\\text{target}}^{-C_{t,\\text{target}}}}{E_{\\text{ref}}^{-C_{t,\\text{ref}}}}$$\nThe problem states that the target and reference genes have matched amplification efficiencies. This implies they share the same amplification factor, so $E_{\\text{target}} = E_{\\text{ref}} = E$. This simplifies the normalized abundance to:\n$$(\\text{Normalized Abundance}) \\propto \\frac{E^{-C_{t,\\text{target}}}}{E^{-C_{t,\\text{ref}}}} = E^{C_{t,\\text{ref}} - C_{t,\\text{target}}}$$\nNow, we can write the full expression for $RQ$:\n$$RQ = \\frac{(\\text{Normalized Abundance})_{\\text{sample}}}{(\\text{Normalized Abundance})_{\\text{cal}}} = \\frac{E^{C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}} - C_{t,\\text{target,sample}}}}{E^{C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{target,cal}}}}$$\n$$RQ = E^{(C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}} - C_{t,\\text{target,sample}}) - (C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{target,cal}})}$$\nRearranging the exponent to group terms by gene (target and reference) yields the final derived expression:\n$$RQ = E^{(C_{t,\\text{target,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{target,sample}}) - (C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}})}$$\nThis is often written in terms of $\\Delta C_t$ values. Let $\\Delta C_{t,\\text{gene}} = C_{t,\\text{gene,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{gene,sample}}$.\nThen the expression is $RQ = E^{(\\Delta C_{t,\\text{target}} - \\Delta C_{t,\\text{ref}})}$. The term in the exponent, $(\\Delta C_{t,\\text{target}} - \\Delta C_{t,\\text{ref}})$, is commonly referred to as $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$.\n\n**Step 5: Computation of the Fold Change**\nUsing the provided data:\n-   $C_{t,\\text{target,sample}} = 24.10$\n-   $C_{t,\\text{target,cal}} = 26.85$\n-   $C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}} = 19.40$\n-   $C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} = 19.95$\n\nFirst, calculate the $\\Delta C_t$ for the target and reference genes:\n$$\\Delta C_{t,\\text{target}} = C_{t,\\text{target,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{target,sample}} = 26.85 - 24.10 = 2.75$$\n$$\\Delta C_{t,\\text{ref}} = C_{t,\\text{ref,cal}} - C_{t,\\text{ref,sample}} = 19.95 - 19.40 = 0.55$$\nNext, calculate the $\\Delta\\Delta C_t$:\n$$\\Delta\\Delta C_t = \\Delta C_{t,\\text{target}} - \\Delta C_{t,\\text{ref}} = 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.20$$\nFinally, compute the fold change, $RQ$, using the calculated factor $E = 10^{2/7}$ and $\\Delta\\Delta C_t = 2.20$:\n$$RQ = E^{\\Delta\\Delta C_t} = (10^{2/7})^{2.20} = 10^{(2/7) \\times 2.20} = 10^{(2/7) \\times (22/10)} = 10^{44/70} = 10^{22/35}$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$RQ = 10^{22/35} \\approx 10^{0.6285714...} \\approx 4.25169003$$\nRounding the final result to four significant figures gives $4.252$. This indicates that the target cytokine gene is expressed at an approximately $4.252$-fold higher level in the patient sample compared to the healthy donor calibrator, after normalization.",
