            "problem": "In a competitive immunoassay such as an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA), the calibration curve is commonly modeled by a four-parameter logistic (4PL) function that maps analyte concentration $x$ to measured signal $y$ as\n$$\ny(x) \\;=\\; A \\;+\\; \\frac{D - A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}},\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the asymptotic lower signal (background), $D$ is the asymptotic upper signal (saturation), $C$ is the inflection-point concentration (often denoted the half-maximum point), and $s>0$ is the logistic slope parameter. Assume $D>A$ and $s>0$, which is typical for a monotone decreasing standard curve in immunoassays.\n\nStarting only from the definition above, the chain rule, and first-order uncertainty propagation, do the following:\n\n1.

Interpret this as the local resolution in base-$10$ logarithmic concentration units. Express the slope in units of signal per decade of concentration and the resolution in decades of concentration. No unit conversion beyond specifying base-$10$ logarithms is required.\n\nReport both expressions in their simplest analytic form. The final answer must be provided as symbolic expressions; no numerical evaluation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in standard immunoassay modeling, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. The requested derivations are standard exercises in calculus and error propagation theory applied to a widely used model in analytical biochemistry.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the slope of the four-parameter logistic (4PL) curve with respect to the base-$10$ logarithm of the concentration at the inflection point. Second, we derive the uncertainty in the base-$10$ logarithm of concentration at the same point, based on a given uncertainty in the measured signal.\n\nThe 4PL function is given as:\n$$\ny(x) = A + \\frac{D - A}{1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}}\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the concentration and $y$ is the signal. The parameters are the lower asymptote $A$, the upper asymptote $D$, the inflection point concentration $C$, and the slope parameter $s$. The conditions are $D>A$ and $s>0$.\n\n### Part 1: Slope at the Inflection Point\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\left.\\frac{dy}{d(\\log_{10} x)}\\right|_{x=C}$.\nLet us define a new variable for the logarithmic concentration, $u = \\log_{10} x$.\nTo find the derivative $\\frac{dy}{du}$, we apply the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{du} = \\frac{dy}{dx} \\cdot \\frac{dx}{du}\n$$\nFirst, we find the relationship between $x$ and $u$. Since $u = \\log_{10} x = \\frac{\\ln x}{\\ln 10}$, we can express $x$ in terms of $u$ as $x = 10^u$.\nThe derivative $\\frac{dx}{du}$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{du} = \\frac{d}{du}(10^u) = \\frac{d}{du}(\\exp(u \\ln 10)) = \\ln(10) \\exp(u \\ln 10) = x \\ln(10)\n$$\nNext, we compute the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. The function is $y(x) = A + (D - A) [1 + (x/C)^s]^{-1}$.\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = (D - A) \\cdot (-1) \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of the inner term is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right] = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\frac{x^s}{C^s}\\right] = \\frac{s x^{s-1}}{C^s} = \\frac{s}{C}\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s-1}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{dy}{dx}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -(D - A) \\frac{\\frac{s}{C}\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s-1}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^2}\n$$\nNow, we can find $\\frac{dy}{du}$ by multiplying $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ and $\\frac{dx}{du}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{du} = \\left( -(D - A) \\frac{\\frac{s}{C}\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s-1}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^2} \\right) \\cdot (x \\ln(10))\n$$\nSimplifying the expression by combining terms involving $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{du} = -(D - A) \\ln(10) \\frac{\\frac{s x}{C}\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s-1}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^2} = -(D - A) \\ln(10) \\frac{s\\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{x}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this slope at the inflection point, $x=C$. We substitute $x=C$ into the expression:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{x=C} = \\left.\\frac{dy}{d(\\log_{10} x)}\\right|_{x=C} = -(D - A) \\ln(10) \\frac{s\\left(\\frac{C}{C}\\right)^{s}}{\\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{C}{C}\\right)^{s}\\right]^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dy}{d(\\log_{10} x)}\\right|_{x=C} = -(D - A) \\ln(10) \\frac{s(1)^s}{[1 + 1^s]^2} = -(D - A) \\ln(10) \\frac{s}{(1+1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dy}{d(\\log_{10} x)}\\right|_{x=C} = - \\frac{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}{4}\n$$\nThis is the first required expression. It represents the local slope of the signal versus the base-$10$ logarithmic concentration, with units of signal per decade.\n\n### Part 2: Uncertainty in Logarithmic Concentration\n\nWe are asked to find the standard deviation of $\\log_{10} x$, denoted $\\sigma_{\\log_{10} x}$, at $x=C$, given a constant standard deviation of the signal, $\\sigma_y$.\nWe use the first-order approximation for propagation of uncertainty. If $u = f(y)$, then $\\sigma_u^2 \\approx (\\frac{df}{dy})^2 \\sigma_y^2$.\nHere, $u = \\log_{10} x$. We need to find the functional relationship $u(y)$ by inverting the 4PL equation. However, rather than inverting the full function, we only need the local derivative $\\frac{du}{dy}$ at the point of interest, $x=C$.\nUsing the inverse function theorem, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dy} = \\left(\\frac{dy}{du}\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of $u$ is then given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_u = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{du}{dy}\\right)^2 \\sigma_y^2} = \\left|\\frac{du}{dy}\\right| \\sigma_y = \\left|\\left(\\frac{dy}{du}\\right)^{-1}\\right| \\sigma_y\n$$\nWe need to evaluate this at $x=C$. Using the result from Part 1:\n$$\n\\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{x=C} = - \\frac{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}{4}\n$$\nNow, we can find the magnitude of the inverse derivative:\n$$\n\\left|\\left(\\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{x=C}\\right)^{-1}\\right| = \\left|\\left(- \\frac{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}{4}\\right)^{-1}\\right| = \\left|- \\frac{4}{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}\\right|\n$$\nSince $s>0$ and $D>A$ are given, the term inside the absolute value is negative. Therefore:\n$$\n\\left|\\left(\\left.\\frac{dy}{du}\\right|_{x=C}\\right)^{-1}\\right| = \\frac{4}{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the expression for the standard deviation of $u=\\log_{10} x$ at $x=C$, which we denote $\\sigma_{\\log_{10} x}(C)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\log_{10} x}(C) = \\frac{4}{s \\ln(10) (D - A)} \\sigma_y = \\frac{4 \\sigma_y}{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}\n$$\nThis is the second required expression. It represents the local resolution in concentration, expressed in units of decades, and shows that resolution improves (i.e., $\\sigma_{\\log_{10} x}$ decreases) with a larger dynamic range $(D-A)$ and a steeper curve (larger $s$), and degrades with higher signal noise $\\sigma_y$.\n\nThe two final expressions are:\n1. Slope at $x=C$: $- \\frac{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}{4}$\n2. Standard deviation of $\\log_{10} x$ at $x=C$: $\\frac{4 \\sigma_y}{s \\ln(10) (D - A)}$",

            "problem": "In a sandwich immunoassay whose calibration is ultimately modeled by a four-parameter logistic (4PL) function, laboratories routinely apply a variance-stabilizing transformation to the raw signal so that, over the working range of concentrations, the transformed response is well approximated by a linear function of the logarithm (base $10$) of analyte concentration. Specifically, let the transformed signal be denoted by $y$ and the base-$10$ logarithm of analyte concentration by $x = \\log_{10}(c)$. Assume the working calibration region $x \\in [a,b]$ with $a=-2$ and $b=2$, corresponding to a dynamic range of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{2}$.

The constraints are realistic and the objective is clearly defined. The problem is self-contained, mathematically formalizable, and devoid of any scientific or logical flaws.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Average Inverse-Calibration Variance\n\nLet the fitted regression line be $\\hat{y} = \\hat{\\beta}_0 + \\hat{\\beta}_1 x$. For a new sample, a single response $y_0$ is observed, corresponding to an unknown true value $x^{\\ast}$. The inverse-calibration estimate of $x^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\hat{x} = \\frac{y_0 - \\hat{\\beta}_0}{\\hat{\\beta}_1}\n$$\nThe variance of this estimate, conditional on $x^{\\ast}$, can be found using first-order error propagation (the delta method). The variance of $\\hat{x}$ arises from the random error in the new measurement $y_0$ (where $\\mathbb{E}[y_0] = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x^{\\ast}$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(y_0) = \\sigma^2$) and the uncertainty in the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\beta}_1$ from the calibration data. A standard result for the variance of an inverse prediction from a single new observation is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{x}\\,|\\,x^{\\ast}) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(x^{\\ast} - \\bar{x})^2}{S_{xx}} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the total number of calibration points, $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the calibrator $x$-values, and $S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2$ is the sum of squared deviations of the calibrator $x$-values.\n\nThe next step is to evaluate the design-dependent terms $\\bar{x}$ and $S_{xx}$.\nThe $L$ calibrator levels are equally spaced over the interval $[a, b]$. The design is symmetric, so the mean of the levels is the midpoint of the interval:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{a+b}{2} = \\frac{-2+2}{2} = 0\n$$\nWith $\\bar{x}=0$, the sum of squared deviations becomes $S_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i^2$. Since there are $r$ replicates at each of the $L$ levels (denoted $x_k$ for $k=1, \\dots, L$), this sum is:\n$$\nS_{xx} = r \\sum_{k=1}^{L} x_k^2\n$$\nFor $L$ levels equally spaced on $[a, b] = [-h, h]$, where $h = (b-a)/2$, the sum of squares of the levels is a known result:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{L} x_k^2 = \\frac{L(L+1)}{3(L-1)} h^2\n$$\nFor our problem, $h = (2 - (-2))/2 = 2$.\nTherefore,\n$$\nS_{xx} = r \\left( \\frac{L(L+1)}{3(L-1)} \\right) (2)^2 = \\frac{4rL(L+1)}{3(L-1)}\n$$\nSince $N=Lr$, we can write this as:\n$$\nS_{xx} = \\frac{4N(L+1)}{3(L-1)}\n$$\nWith $\\bar{x}=0$, the variance formula is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{x}\\,|\\,x^{\\ast}) \\approx \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{(x^{\\ast})^2}{S_{xx}} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the average of this variance, where $x^{\\ast}$ is uniformly distributed over $[a, b] = [-2, 2]$. We need to compute $\\mathbb{E}_{x^{\\ast}}[(x^{\\ast})^2]$.\nFor a uniform distribution on $[-h, h]$, the expected value of the square of the variable is the variance of the distribution (since the mean is $0$), which is $h^2/3$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{x^{\\ast}}[(x^{\\ast})^2] = \\frac{(2 - (-2))^2}{12} = \\frac{16}{12} = \\frac{4}{3}\n$$\nThe average variance, $V_{\\text{avg}}$, is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\mathbb{E}_{x^{\\ast}}[\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{x}\\,|\\,x^{\\ast})] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{x^{\\ast}}[(x^{\\ast})^2]}{S_{xx}} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{4/3}{S_{xx}} \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{xx}$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{4/3}{\\frac{4N(L+1)}{3(L-1)}} \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{1}{N} \\frac{L-1}{L+1} \\right]\n$$\nCombining the terms dependent on $N$:\n$$\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} \\left( 1 + \\frac{L-1}{L+1} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{N} \\left( \\frac{L+1+L-1}{L+1} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nV_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\beta_1^2} \\left[ 1 + \\frac{2L}{N(L+1)} \\right]\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Minimization Under Constraints\nTo minimize $V_{\\text{avg}}$, we must minimize the term that depends on the design choice $L$, since $\\sigma^2$, $\\beta_1^2$, and $N$ are constants. The function to minimize is:\n$$\nf(L) = \\frac{L}{L+1} = 1 - \\frac{1}{L+1}\n$$\nMinimizing $f(L)$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\frac{1}{L+1}$, which in turn is equivalent to minimizing $L$.\n\nWe must find the integer pair $(L, r)$ that minimizes $L$ subject to the constraints:\n1. $L r = 48$\n2. $L \\geq 6$\n3. $r \\geq 2$\n\nWe list the pairs of integer factors of $48$ and check them against the constraints:\n- $L=1, r=48$: Fails $L \\geq 6$.\n- $L=2, r=24$: Fails $L \\geq 6$.\n- $L=3, r=16$: Fails $L \\geq 6$.\n- $L=4, r=12$: Fails $L \\geq 6$.\n- $L=6, r=8$: Satisfies all constraints ($L=6 \\geq 6$, $r=8 \\geq 2$).\n- $L=8, r=6$: Satisfies all constraints.\n- $L=12, r=4$: Satisfies all constraints.\n- $L=16, r=3$: Satisfies all constraints.\n- $L=24, r=2$: Satisfies all constraints.\n- $L=48, r=1$: Fails $r \\geq 2$.\n\nThe set of valid values for $L$ is $\\{6, 8, 12, 16, 24\\}$. To minimize the average variance, we must choose the minimum possible value for $L$ from this set.\nThe minimum valid $L$ is $L=6$.\nFor $L=6$, the corresponding number of replicates $r$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{N}{L} = \\frac{48}{6} = 8\n$$\nThus, the optimal design under the given constraints is to use $L=6$ distinct calibrator levels with $r=8$ replicates per level. The question asks for the optimal integer value of $r$.\n\nThe optimal number of replicates per level is $8$.",

Taking the natural logarithm of the inverse function:\n$$\n\\ln(x) = \\ln(E) + \\frac{1}{S} \\ln\\left(\\frac{U - y}{y - L}\\right) = \\ln(E) + \\frac{1}{S} \\left[ \\ln(U - y) - \\ln(y - L) \\right]\n$$\nDifferentiating with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{x} \\frac{dx}{dy} = \\frac{1}{S} \\left[ \\frac{-1}{U - y} - \\frac{1}{y - L} \\right] = -\\frac{1}{S} \\left[ \\frac{(y - L) + (U - y)}{(U - y)(y - L)} \\right] = -\\frac{U - L}{S(U - y)(y - L)}\n$$\nThus, the sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dy} = -\\frac{x(U - L)}{S(U - y)(y - L)}\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Gradient Vector and Uncertainty Propagation\n\nTo apply the delta method, we require the gradient of $x$ with respect to the vector of all random variables $\\mathbf{v} = (y, L, U, E, S)^{\\top}$. The gradient is $\\nabla x = \\left( \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial U}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial E}, \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} \\right)^{\\top}$. We continue to use the logarithmic form for ease of differentiation.\n\n1.  **Partial derivative with respect to $y$**: As derived for sensitivity, $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{x(U-L)}{S(U-y)(y-L)}$.\n2.  **Partial derivative with respect to $L$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L} = -\\frac{1}{S}\\left(\\frac{-1}{y-L}\\right) = \\frac{1}{S(y-L)} \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L} = \\frac{x}{S(y-L)}\n    $$\n3.  **Partial derivative with respect to $U$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial U} = \\frac{1}{S}\\left(\\frac{1}{U-y}\\right) = \\frac{1}{S(U-y)} \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial U} = \\frac{x}{S(U-y)}\n    $$\n4.  **Partial derivative with respect to $E$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial E} = \\frac{1}{E} \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial E} = \\frac{x}{E}\n    $$\n5.  **Partial derivative with respect to $S$**:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} = -\\frac{1}{S^2} \\left[ \\ln(U-y) - \\ln(y-L) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{S^2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{U-y}{y-L}\\right)\n    $$\n    From the inverse derivation, we know $S \\ln(x/E) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{U-y}{y-L}\\right)$. Substituting this gives a simpler form:\n    $$\n    \\frac{1}{x}\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} = -\\frac{1}{S^2} \\left( S \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{E}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{1}{S} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{E}\\right) \\implies \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} = -\\frac{x}{S} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x}{E}\\right)\n    $$\n\nNext, we evaluate these derivatives at the given point $(y^{\\ast}, \\hat{L}, \\hat{U}, \\hat{E}, \\hat{S}) = (1.20, 0.05, 2.00, 10.0, 1.20)$. First, we calculate the estimated concentration, denoted $x_0$:\n$$\nx_0 = \\hat{E} \\left(\\frac{\\hat{U} - y^{\\ast}}{y^{\\ast} - \\hat{L}}\\right)^{1/\\hat{S}} = 10.0 \\left(\\frac{2.00 - 1.20}{1.20 - 0.05}\\right)^{1/1.20} = 10.0 \\left(\\frac{0.80}{1.15}\\right)^{1/1.2} \\approx 7.38998\n$$\nNow we evaluate the gradient components at this point:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{7.38998 \\times (2.00 - 0.05)}{1.20 \\times (2.00 - 1.20)(1.20 - 0.05)} = -\\frac{7.38998 \\times 1.95}{1.20 \\times 0.80 \\times 1.15} \\approx -13.0530\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L} = \\frac{7.38998}{1.20 \\times (1.20 - 0.05)} = \\frac{7.38998}{1.20 \\times 1.15} \\approx 5.3551\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial U} = \\frac{7.38998}{1.20 \\times (2.00 - 1.20)} = \\frac{7.38998}{1.20 \\times 0.80} \\approx 7.6979\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial E} = \\frac{7.38998}{10.0} \\approx 0.7390\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial S} = -\\frac{7.38998}{1.20} \\ln\\left(\\frac{7.38998}{10.0}\\right) \\approx -6.1583 \\times (-0.30245) \\approx 1.8621\n$$\nThe gradient vector is $\\nabla x \\approx (-13.0530, 5.3551, 7.6979, 0.7390, 1.8621)^{\\top}$.\n\nThe propagated variance is $\\operatorname{Var}(x) \\approx \\nabla x^{\\top} \\Sigma \\nabla x$.
