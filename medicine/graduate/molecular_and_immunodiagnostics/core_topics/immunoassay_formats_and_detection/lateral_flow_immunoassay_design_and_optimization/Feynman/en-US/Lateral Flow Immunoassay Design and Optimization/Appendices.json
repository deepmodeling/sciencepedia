            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid. It is grounded in the established principles of fluid dynamics within porous media, specifically capillarity-driven flow as described by Darcy's Law and the Young-Laplace equation, which are the fundamental concepts governing wicking in lateral flow immunoassays. The provided parameters and conditions are self-contained, consistent, and physically realistic. The problem is well-posed and objective, allowing for a unique, meaningful solution.\n\nThe superficial velocity, $u$, of a fluid driven through a porous medium by a pressure gradient is described by Darcy's Law. In one dimension, this is expressed as:\n$$ u = -\\frac{K}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dx} $$\nwhere $K$ is the permeability of the porous medium, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $\\frac{dP}{dx}$ is the pressure gradient. For capillarity-driven flow in a horizontal strip, the driving force is the capillary pressure, $P_c$, generated by the meniscus in the pores. The pressure gradient is therefore proportional to this capillary pressure. The velocity can thus be expressed as being proportional to the factors that constitute the driving force and a term for viscous resistance:\n$$ u \\propto \\frac{K}{\\mu} P_c $$\nThe problem states that the buffer viscosity, $\\mu$, is constant. Thus, the velocity's dependence on the membrane's physical properties is given by:\n$$ u \\propto K P_c $$\nWe must now relate both permeability $K$ and capillary pressure $P_c$ to the nominal pore radius, $r$.\n\nThe permeability, $K$, of a porous medium can be described by the Kozeny-Carman model (or a simplified form thereof), which relates it to the porosity, $\\epsilon$, and a characteristic dimension of the pores, such as the radius $r$. A common simplified form of this relationship is:\n$$ K = \\frac{\\epsilon r^2}{k_K} $$\nwhere $k_K$ is the Kozeny constant, which depends on the tortuosity and shape of the pores. The problem specifies that the porosity $\\epsilon$ and the Kozeny constant $k_K$ are identical for both membranes. Therefore, the permeability is directly proportional to the square of the pore radius:\n$$ K \\propto r^2 $$\n\nThe capillary pressure, $P_c$, is described by the Young-Laplace equation. For a cylindrical pore, this is:\n$$ P_c = \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the surface tension of the liquid-air interface and $\\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the solid matrix. The problem states that due to identical surface chemistry, both $\\gamma$ and $\\theta$ are constant. Consequently, the capillary pressure is inversely proportional to the pore radius:\n$$ P_c \\propto \\frac{1}{r} $$\n\nCombining these proportionalities, we can determine the relationship between the superficial velocity $u$ and the pore radius $r$:\n$$ u \\propto K P_c \\propto (r^2) \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) $$\n$$ u \\propto r $$\nThis demonstrates that the superficial velocity is directly proportional to the nominal pore radius, assuming all other relevant physical parameters are held constant.\n\nWe can now use this relationship to find the new superficial velocity, $u_2$, for the membrane with a pore radius of $r_2 = 8\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, based on the known velocity, $u_1 = 3.00\\,\\text{mm s}^{-1}$, for the membrane with a pore radius of $r_1 = 15\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.

The problem states the binding follows second-order kinetics with a rate constant $k_{\\text{on}}$. The reactants are the analyte, with bulk concentration $C$, and the surface-bound capture antibodies. The problem specifies that capture site occupancy is low, which implies that the concentration of available binding sites is approximately constant. Under this condition, the second-order reaction behaves as a pseudo-first-order reaction with respect to the analyte concentration. The pseudo-first-order rate constant, $k'$, is given by the product of the second-order rate constant and the effectively constant reactant concentration (here, using the bulk analyte concentration $C$ is justified by the assumption of negligible depletion). Thus, we have $k' = k_{\\text{on}}C$.

Let the analyte be denoted by $A$, the labeled detection antibody by $D$, the preformed complex in the flowing phase by $C \\equiv A\\!:\\!D$, and the immobilized capture antibody by $S$. The detection step depends on surface capture of $C$ by $S$ to form the signaling sandwich, whereas at high analyte concentration, free $A$ can also occupy $S$ without forming signal, causing the high-dose hook effect (prozone effect). Assume the following well-tested and widely used modeling bases:\n- In the mobile phase upstream of the test line, $A$ and $D$ establish a rapid pre-equilibrium $A + D \\rightleftharpoons C$ characterized by a dissociation constant $K_{D,1}$, such that the fraction of $D$ bound in $C$ is $f = \\frac{[A]}{K_{D,1} + [A]}$.\n- At the test line, surface binding events are reaction-limited with similar association kinetics for $A$ and $C$ to $S$ over the relevant range, so the initial surface capture rates are proportional to their bulk concentrations times a common first-order factor in the available surface sites. Thus, the condition for onset of the hook effect can be approximated by the equality of arrival/capture propensities of $A$ and $C$ at the surface, which scales as $[A] \\approx \\gamma [C]$ with $\\gamma \\approx 1$ fixed by the ratio of association rate constants and any transport correction that remains unchanged across designs.\n- On the assay timescale, capture by $S$ is effectively irreversible relative to convective transport, and the capture site density and hydrodynamic conditions are held fixed across designs.\n\nThe current assay exhibits a clear signal downturn (hook onset) beyond an antigen concentration of $100$ ng/mL under a baseline conjugate dose that provides a total mobile-phase concentration $[D]_{\\text{tot}} = D_{0}$ after release.

It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model of the high-dose hook effect in a lateral flow immunoassay, a common topic in immunodiagnostics. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe goal is to determine the required fold-increase in the total concentration of the labeled detection antibody, $[D]_{\\text{tot}}$, to shift the onset of the high-dose hook effect from an analyte concentration of $[A]_{\\text{hook},0} = 100$ ng/mL to $[A]_{\\text{hook},1} = 500$ ng/mL.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental relationships provided.\nThe total concentration of the labeled detection antibody, $[D]_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of its free form, $[D]$, and its complexed form, $[C]$:\n$$[D]_{\\text{tot}} = [D] + [C] \\quad (1)$$\nIn the mobile phase, the analyte $A$ and detection antibody $D$ are in a pre-equilibrium to form the complex $C$:\n$$A + D \\rightleftharpoons C$$\nThis equilibrium is characterized by the dissociation constant $K_{D,1}$:\n$$K_{D,1} = \\frac{[A][D]}{[C]} \\quad (2)$$\nFrom equation $(2)$, we can express the concentration of free detection antibody, $[D]$, as:\n$$[D] = \\frac{K_{D,1}[C]}{[A]} \\quad (3)$$\nSubstituting equation $(3)$ into the mass balance equation $(1)$ gives:\n$$[D]_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{K_{D,1}[C]}{[A]} + [C]$$\nFactoring out $[C]$, we get:\n$$[D]_{\\text{tot}} = [C] \\left( \\frac{K_{D,1}}{[A]} + 1 \\right) \\quad (4)$$\nThe problem states that the onset of the hook effect occurs when the capture propensities of free analyte $A$ and the complex $C$ at the test line surface are approximately equal.

The high-analyte condition $[A]_{\\text{hook}} \\gg K_{D,1}$ implies that the antibody-analyte affinity (related to $K_{D,1}$) must be high enough such that the dissociation constant is much smaller than the analyte concentrations where the hook effect is observed.
