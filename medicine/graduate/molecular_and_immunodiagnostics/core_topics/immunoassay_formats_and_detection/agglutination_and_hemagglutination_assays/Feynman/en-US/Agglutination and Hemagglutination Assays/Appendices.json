            "problem": "A clinical virology laboratory is performing a hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay to quantify antibodies against an influenza virus in a human serum sample. The assay uses a standard microtiter setup with two-fold serial serum dilutions prepared in phosphate-buffered saline, equal-volume mixing with virus and red blood cells (RBCs), and readout by visual scoring of RBC buttons versus lattice formation.\n\nAssay conditions are as follows:\n- Influenza virions are pre-titrated by hemagglutination (HA) against standardized RBCs to determine the hemagglutinating unit (HAU). By definition, $1$ HAU is the smallest amount of virus that produces complete hemagglutination under the assay conditions.

A systematic validation of the problem statement is the necessary first step.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Assay Type**: Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay for influenza virus antibodies.\n- **Assay Components**: Human serum, influenza virions, red blood cells (RBCs), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n- **Virus Standardization**: $1$ hemagglutinating unit ($1$ HAU) is defined as the smallest amount of virus causing complete hemagglutination. The HAI assay uses an input of $4$ HAU per well.\n- **Serum Dilutions**: Two-fold serial dilutions ranging from $1{:}10$ to $1{:}1280$.\n- **RBC Concentration**: $0.5\\%$ (v/v) RBCs are added after serum-virus incubation.\n- **Readout Criteria**:\n    - **Complete Inhibition**: A compact RBC button with no lattice formation.

The principles of viral hemagglutination and its inhibition by specific antibodies are fundamental concepts in immunology and virology. The definitions of HAU, the use of $4$ HAU, serial dilutions, and the interpretation of RBC buttons versus lattices are all standard laboratory practice. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information: the experimental results and a clear, unambiguous definition of the endpoint (HAI titer). The question is structured to have a unique and meaningful solution derivable directly from the supplied data and definitions.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective, and technical language. It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or opinion.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that requires the direct application of a defined technical term to a set of experimental data. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to determine the HAI titer based on the provided experimental data and the specific definition of the titer.\n\nThe principle of the HAI assay is that antibodies in a patient's serum can neutralize the agglutinating property of a virus. The concentration of these antibodies is determined by serially diluting the serum and finding the highest dilution that still completely inhibits hemagglutination.\n\nThe problem provides the following results for the serial dilutions:\n1.  Serum dilution $1{:}80$: Complete inhibition.\n2.  Serum dilution $1{:}160$: Complete inhibition.\n3.  Serum dilution $1{:}320$: Partial inhibition.\n4.  Serum dilution $1{:}640$: No inhibition.\n\nThe problem explicitly states the rule for determining the endpoint: the HAI titer is the reciprocal of the **highest serum dilution that meets the complete inhibition criterion**.\n\nWe must identify all dilutions that showed \"complete inhibition\". According to the data, these are the dilutions $1{:}80$ and $1{:}160$.\n\nNext, we must identify the \"highest\" of these dilutions. A higher dilution corresponds to a more dilute sample, which is represented by a larger number in the denominator of the dilution ratio. Comparing the two dilutions that showed complete inhibition, $1{:}80$ and $1{:}160$, the highest dilution is $1{:}160$.\n\nThe dilution $1{:}320$ showed \"partial inhibition\", which, by the problem's definition, \"does not meet the criterion for complete inhibition\". Therefore, this dilution is not considered for determining the endpoint. The dilutions $1{:}640$ and higher showed no inhibition and are also not considered.\n\nThe endpoint of the titration is therefore the dilution $1{:}160$.\n\nFinally, the HAI titer is calculated as the reciprocal of this dilution. The reciprocal of the fraction $\\frac{1}{160}$ is given by:\n$$ \\text{Titer} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1}{160}\\right)} = 160 $$\nThe resulting HAI titer is $160$. The problem asks for this value as a single unitless integer.",

            "problem": "A red blood cell (RBC) hemagglutination assay performed with patient serum shows a prozone effect at neat (undiluted) and at a $1{:}2$ dilution, but visible agglutination at $1{:}8$. The specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) that mediates agglutination is present in the neat serum at $200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$.

            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Assay type: Red blood cell (RBC) hemagglutination assay.\n- Observation 1: Prozone effect at neat (undiluted) and $1{:}2$ dilution of patient serum.\n- Observation 2: Visible agglutination at $1{:}8$ dilution.\n- Neat immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration in serum: $C_{\\text{neat}} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$.\n- IgG molecular weight: $M_w = 150{,}000\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$.\n- Equilibrium dissociation constant for IgG-epitope binding: $K_d = 1.7 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n- Assumption: Total concentration of RBC epitopes is negligible relative to antibody concentration, thus the free antibody concentration, $[Ab]_{\\text{free}}$, is approximately equal to the diluted total antibody concentration.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of immunochemistry and physical chemistry, specifically the law of mass action governing receptor-ligand binding, the bivalent nature of IgG antibodies, and the prozone (or high-dose hook) effect observed in immunoassays. These are well-established concepts in molecular and immunodiagnostics.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary quantitative data ($C_{\\text{neat}}$, $M_w$, $K_d$) and a key simplifying assumption (free antibody concentration equals total diluted concentration) to allow for a unique, stable, and meaningful solution. The question is specific and answerable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unbiased scientific language. The observations provided ($1{:}8$ agglutination) act as a consistency check rather than a subjective constraint.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any invalidating flaws. It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, or ill-posed. The scenario described is a classic textbook example of the prozone effect in agglutination assays.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires a three-part solution: first, the derivation of the fractional occupancy of RBC epitopes; second, the articulation of a physical criterion for agglutination; and third, the calculation of the minimal dilution factor to meet this criterion.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Fractional Occupancy\n\nLet $[E]$ be the concentration of free epitopes on the RBC surface, $[Ab]$ be the concentration of free antibody binding sites, and $[AbE]$ be the concentration of antibody-epitope complexes. The binding reaction is reversible:\n$$\nE + Ab \\rightleftharpoons AbE\n$$\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[E][Ab]}{[AbE]}\n$$\nThe total concentration of epitopes, $[E]_T$, is the sum of free and bound epitopes:\n$$\n[E]_T = [E] + [AbE]\n$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is the fraction of total epitopes that are bound by antibody:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AbE]}{[E]_T}\n$$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $[Ab]$ and $K_d$, we first rearrange the expression for $[E]_T$ to solve for $[E]$:\n$$\n[E] = [E]_T - [AbE]\n$$\nSubstitute this into the equation for $K_d$:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([E]_T - [AbE])[Ab]}{[AbE]}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the ratio $[AbE]/[E]_T$.\n$$\nK_d [AbE] = ([E]_T - [AbE])[Ab] = [E]_T [Ab] - [AbE][Ab]\n$$\n$$\nK_d [AbE] + [AbE][Ab] = [E]_T [Ab]\n$$\n$$\n[AbE](K_d + [Ab]) = [E]_T [Ab]\n$$\nDividing by $[E]_T$ and by $(K_d + [Ab])$, we obtain the expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AbE]}{[E]_T} = \\frac{[Ab]}{K_d + [Ab]}\n$$\nThis is the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which describes the fractional occupancy of binding sites.\n\n### Part 2: Articulation of Agglutination Criterion\n\nAgglutination, or the formation of a macroscopic lattice of cross-linked RBCs, requires that bivalent IgG antibodies bridge separate cells. The prozone effect, observed at high antibody concentrations, occurs because the high density of antibodies leads to the saturation of epitopes on individual cells. When the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ approaches $1$, nearly every available epitope is bound. This monovalent saturation prevents a single antibody molecule from forming a bridge between two cells, thereby inhibiting lattice formation.\n\nTo alleviate the prozone effect and enable agglutination, the system must transition from this saturated state to one where cross-linking is favorable. Optimal cross-linking occurs when there is a balance between occupied and free epitopes on the cell surfaces. This allows a bivalent antibody to bind to an occupied site on one cell (or, more accurately, for one arm to bind to one cell and the other arm to find a free epitope on another cell). The probability of forming a cross-link is related to the product of the number of free sites and occupied sites, which is maximized when half the sites are free and half are occupied. This corresponds to a fractional occupancy of $\\theta = 0.5$.\n\nFrom the derived occupancy equation, setting $\\theta = 0.5$ yields:\n$$\n0.5 = \\frac{[Ab]}{K_d + [Ab]}\n$$\n$$\n0.5(K_d + [Ab]) = [Ab]\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d + 0.5 [Ab] = [Ab]\n$$\n$$\n0.5 K_d = 0.5 [Ab] \\implies [Ab] = K_d\n$$\nTherefore, a physically motivated criterion to move out of the prozone and enable lattice formation is to dilute the serum until the free antibody concentration becomes less than or equal to the dissociation constant, $K_d$.\n$$\n[Ab] \\le K_d\n$$\nThis condition ensures the system is no longer in epitope saturation ($\\theta \\approx 1$) and is at or near the optimal state for cross-linking ($\\theta \\le 0.5$).\n\n### Part 3: Calculation of Minimal Dilution\n\nFirst, we must calculate the molar concentration of IgG in the neat (undiluted) serum, $[Ab]_{\\text{neat}}$. Note that since IgG is bivalent, the concentration of binding sites is twice the concentration of IgG molecules. However, the equilibrium constant $K_d$ is typically defined with respect to the concentration of ligand molecules. The problem defines $K_d$ for \"IgG binding\", thus we will proceed using molar concentration of the IgG protein itself. The problem also simplifies this by having us use the diluted total antibody concentration as the free antibody concentration.\n\nThe given concentration is $C_{\\text{neat}} = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g/mL}$. We convert this to units of $\\mathrm{g/L}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{neat}} = 200\\,\\frac{\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mL}} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}} = 0.2\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{L}}\n$$\nThe molar concentration is the mass concentration divided by the molecular weight, $M_w = 150{,}000\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$:\n$$\n[Ab]_{\\text{neat}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{neat}}}{M_w} = \\frac{0.2\\,\\mathrm{g/L}}{150{,}000\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-1}}{1.5 \\times 10^5}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = \\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nLet $d$ be the fold dilution. The diluted antibody concentration, $[Ab]_d$, is:\n$$\n[Ab]_d = \\frac{[Ab]_{\\text{neat}}}{d}\n$$\nThe problem states to assume the free antibody concentration $[Ab]$ is approximately equal to the diluted total antibody concentration, so $[Ab] \\approx [Ab]_d$. Applying the criterion derived in Part 2:\n$$\n[Ab]_d \\le K_d\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[Ab]_{\\text{neat}}}{d} \\le K_d\n$$\nTo find the minimal dilution, we solve for $d$:\n$$\nd \\ge \\frac{[Ab]_{\\text{neat}}}{K_d}\n$$\nThe minimal dilution, $d_{\\min}$, corresponds to the lower bound of this inequality. We substitute the known values for $[Ab]_{\\text{neat}}$ and $K_d = 1.7 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$:\n$$\nd_{\\min} \\ge \\frac{\\frac{4}{3} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}}{1.7 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\min} \\ge \\frac{4 \\times 10^{-6}}{3 \\times 1.7 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{40}{3 \\times 1.7} = \\frac{40}{5.1}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\min} \\ge 7.8431...\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimal **whole-number** fold dilution. The smallest integer value of $d$ that satisfies $d \\ge 7.8431...$ is $8$. Thus, the minimal whole-number fold dilution required is $8$. This result is consistent with the experimental observation that agglutination is visible at a $1{:}8$ dilution.",

Rearranging the inequality to form a likelihood ratio test, we classify as $\\mathcal{C}_{1}$ if:\n$$ \\frac{p(h \\mid \\mathcal{C}_{1})}{p(h \\mid \\mathcal{C}_{0})} > \\frac{C_{10} P(\\mathcal{C}_{0})}{C_{01} P(\\mathcal{C}_{1})} $$\nSubstituting the given values for costs and priors:\n$$ \\frac{p(h \\mid \\mathcal{C}_{1})}{p(h \\mid \\mathcal{C}_{0})} > \\frac{(1)(0.50)}{(2)(0.50)} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow, we substitute the Gaussian probability density functions into the likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(h-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(h-\\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)} > \\frac{1}{2} $$\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(h-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{(h-\\mu_0)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) > \\frac{1}{2} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{(h-\\mu_0)^2 - (h-\\mu_1)^2}{2\\sigma^2} > \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) $$\nExpanding the terms in the numerator:\n$$ (h^2 - 2h\\mu_0 + \\mu_0^2) - (h^2 - 2h\\mu_1 + \\mu_1^2) > -2\\sigma^2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ 2h\\mu_1 - 2h\\mu_0 - \\mu_1^2 + \\mu_0^2  -2\\sigma^2\\ln(2) $$\n$$ 2h(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)  (\\mu_1^2 - \\mu_0^2) - 2\\sigma^2\\ln(2) $$\nSince $\\mu_1 > \\mu_0$, we can divide by $2(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$ h > \\frac{\\mu_1^2 - \\mu_0^2}{2(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)} - \\frac{2\\sigma^2\\ln(2)}{2(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)} $$\n$$ h > \\frac{(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)(\\mu_1 + \\mu_0)}{2(\\mu_1 - \\mu_0)} - \\frac{\\sigma^2\\ln(2)}{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0} $$\nThis gives the decision rule: classify as agglutinated ($\\mathcal{C}_1$) if $h > h^*$, where the threshold $h^*$ is:\n$$ h^* = \\frac{\\mu_1 + \\mu_0}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\mu_1 - \\mu_0}\\ln(2) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values: $\\mu_1 = 1.50$, $\\mu_0 = 0.60$, and $\\sigma = 0.25$.\n$$ h^* = \\frac{1.50 + 0.60}{2} - \\frac{(0.25)^2}{1.50 - 0.60}\\ln(2) $$\n$$ h^* = \\frac{2.10}{2} - \\frac{0.0625}{0.90}\\ln(2) = 1.05 - \\frac{0.0625}{0.90}\\ln(2) $$\nFollowing the instruction to round intermediate values to four significant figures:\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$.\nThe correction term is calculated as $\\frac{0.0625}{0.90} \\times 0.6931$.\nFirst intermediate term: $\\frac{0.0625}{0.90} \\approx 0.069444...$, which rounds to $0.06944$.\nSecond intermediate term: $0.06944 \\times 0.6931 = 0.048128...$, which rounds to $0.04813$.\n$$ h^* = 1.05 - 0.04813 = 1.00187 $$\nSo, a single replicate is classified as agglutinated if its halo width $h \\geq 1.00187 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nNext, we apply this threshold to the triplicate measurements for each dilution.\nThe decision rule for a dilution is that it is classified as agglutinated if at least $2$ of the $3$ replicates are agglutinated ($h \\geq h^*$).\n\nDilution $1{:}160$:\nMeasurements: $h_1 = 1.21$, $h_2 = 1.15$, $h_3 = 1.09$.\n- $1.21 \\geq 1.00187$ (True)\n- $1.15 \\geq 1.00187$ (True)\n- $1.09 \\geq 1.00187$ (True)\nNumber of agglutinated replicates = $3$. Since $3 \\geq 2$, the $1{:}160$ dilution is classified as **agglutinated**.\n\nDilution $1{:}320$:\nMeasurements: $h_1 = 1.05$, $h_2 = 1.02$, $h_3 = 0.98$.\n- $1.05 \\geq 1.00187$ (True)\n- $1.02 \\geq 1.00187$ (True)\n- $0.98 \\geq 1.00187$ (False)\nNumber of agglutinated replicates = $2$. Since $2 \\geq 2$, the $1{:}320$ dilution is classified as **agglutinated**.\n\nDilution $1{:}640$:\nMeasurements: $h_1 = 0.95$, $h_2 = 0.98$, $h_3 = 0.92$.\n- $0.95 \\geq 1.00187$ (False)\n- $0.98 \\geq 1.00187$ (False)\n- $0.92 \\geq 1.00187$ (False)\nNumber of agglutinated replicates = $0$. Since $0  2$, the $1{:}640$ dilution is classified as **non-agglutinated**.\n\nThe hemagglutination titer is defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution classified as agglutinated. The dilutions classified as agglutinated are $1{:}160$ and $1{:}320$. The highest dilution corresponds to the most dilute sample, which is $1{:}320$.\nThe reciprocal of the dilution $1{:}320$ (or $1/320$) is $320$.\n\nThus, the hemagglutination titer is $320$.",
