This exercise delves into the core of the CLIA reaction, using the law of mass action to model how quickly the system approaches equilibrium.

A target analyte at concentration $1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is introduced in excess volume so that its bulk concentration remains effectively constant during the binding phase. The binding interaction is described by the bimolecular association step $A + B \\rightarrow AB$ with intrinsic association rate constant $k_{on}$ and dissociation $AB \\rightarrow A + B$ with intrinsic dissociation rate constant $k_{off}$. Assume the system is well mixed, mass transport is not rate limiting, the fraction of bound sites is initially zero, and the number of binding sites is negligible compared to the analyte supply, such that $[A]$ can be treated as constant. Starting from the law of mass action and first-order kinetics for reversible binding, derive the general time-dependent solution for the fractional occupancy of the capture sites, and from it compute the time required to reach $0.9$ of the equilibrium fractional occupancy.

            "problem": "A photon-counting chemiluminescent immunoassay platform is evaluated near zero analyte concentration. Replicate measurements of a blank matrix give a mean signal of $50$ counts with a standard deviation of $8$ counts. In the low-concentration regime, the calibration response is linear with slope $120$ counts per $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$, and the intercept equals the blank mean. Assume that the stochastic fluctuations of the blank signal are well modeled by a normal distribution and that the calibration is locally linear in the vicinity of zero analyte concentration. Using the decision-theoretic convention of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), define the limit of detection (LOD) as the analyte concentration that produces an expected signal equal to the blank mean plus $3$ times the blank standard deviation, and define the limit of quantitation (LOQ) analogously with a factor of $10$. Starting from these definitions and the stated assumptions, derive the general expressions for LOD and LOQ in terms of the blank standard deviation and the calibration slope, and then compute their numerical values for this platform. Express both LOD and LOQ in $\\mathrm{ng}/\\mathrm{mL}$, report them in the order LOD then LOQ, and round each to four significant figures.

The limit of quantitation (LOQ) is the lowest concentration that can be measured with an acceptable level of precision and accuracy.
