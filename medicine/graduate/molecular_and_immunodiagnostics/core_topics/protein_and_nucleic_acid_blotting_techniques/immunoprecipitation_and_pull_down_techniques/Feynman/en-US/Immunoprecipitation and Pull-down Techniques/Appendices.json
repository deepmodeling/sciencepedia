This exercise moves beyond simple estimations to a rigorous calculation of bead binding capacity.

            "problem": "A molecular diagnostics laboratory is designing an immunoprecipitation (IP; immunoprecipitation) workflow that uses Protein G magnetic beads to capture a cocktail of antibodies prior to antigen pull-down. The bead supplier specifies a baseline binding capacity of $C_{b}$ milligrams of human Immunoglobulin G (IgG; Immunoglobulin G) per milliliter of bead slurry under standard conditions. By definition, this capacity is the mass of human Immunoglobulin G captured at saturation per unit bead volume. For a different IgG species or subclass $i$, the supplier provides a dimensionless relative binding factor $f_{i}$ defined as the ratio of the mass of species $i$ captured at saturation to the mass of human Immunoglobulin G captured at saturation under otherwise identical conditions, per unit bead volume. The laboratory will crosslink the antibodies to the beads, which reduces effective Fc accessibility, and will perform the binding in a high-salt buffer; both effects reduce the usable binding capacity multiplicatively. To avoid mass-transfer limitations, the laboratory will operate the beads below saturation at a fixed fractional occupancy.\n\nStarting from the definition of binding capacity as a saturation mass per bead volume and the definition of the relative binding factor as a ratio of saturation masses, derive from first principles an expression for the minimum bead volume required to guarantee complete capture of all antibody species in a mixture, when operated at a fixed fractional occupancy and under multiplicative capacity-reducing conditions. Then compute the minimum bead volume for the following planned IP, using a conservative design that guarantees complete capture for all antibodies present:\n\n- Baseline human Immunoglobulin G capacity: $C_{b} = 8.0$ milligrams per milliliter of beads.\n- Antibody cocktail masses: rabbit Immunoglobulin G $= 20$ micrograms, mouse Immunoglobulin G1 $= 50$ micrograms.\n- Relative binding factors on Protein G beads: rabbit Immunoglobulin G $f_{\\mathrm{rabbit}} = 1.0$, mouse Immunoglobulin G1 $f_{\\mathrm{mouse\\,IgG1}} = 0.20$.\n- Crosslinking reduces accessible Fc sites by $12\\%$ (that is, a multiplicative factor of $1 - 0.12$ on usable capacity).\n- High-salt buffer reduces usable capacity by $15\\%$ (that is, a multiplicative factor of $1 - 0.15$).\n- To maintain favorable kinetics, operate at no more than $70\\%$ of the usable capacity (that is, a multiplicative factor of $0.70$ on the fraction of capacity that may be used).\n\nExpress your final answer as a single number equal to the minimum bead volume in microliters. Round your answer to three significant figures and report it in microliters as instructed. Do not include any units in your final boxed answer.",

The problem must first be validated for correctness and solvability.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe verbatim givens from the problem statement are:\n-   Baseline binding capacity: $C_{b}$ milligrams of human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) per milliliter of bead slurry.\n-   Definition of $C_b$: mass of human IgG captured at saturation per unit bead volume.\n-   Relative binding factor for species $i$: $f_i$, a dimensionless ratio of the mass of species $i$ captured at saturation to the mass of human IgG captured at saturation.\n-   Antibody cocktail masses: rabbit IgG $= 20$ micrograms, mouse IgG1 $= 50$ micrograms.\n-   Baseline human IgG capacity: $C_{b} = 8.0$ milligrams per milliliter of beads.\n-   Relative binding factors: $f_{\\mathrm{rabbit}} = 1.0$, $f_{\\mathrm{mouse\\,IgG1}} = 0.20$.\n-   Crosslinking reduction factor: a multiplicative factor of $1 - 0.12$.\n-   High-salt buffer reduction factor: a multiplicative factor of $1 - 0.15$.\n-   Operational fractional occupancy: a multiplicative factor of $0.70$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is grounded in established principles of immunochemistry and bioseparations. Protein G-based immunoprecipitation, species- and subclass-specific binding affinities, the concept of binding capacity, and the effects of chemical modification (crosslinking) and buffer conditions (high salt) on protein-protein interactions are all standard and factual concepts in molecular biology. The numerical values are realistic for a typical laboratory-scale experiment.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary definitions, constants, and constraints to derive a general formula and then compute a unique numerical solution. The objective is clearly stated.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or unrealism). The logic required involves translating mass-based binding capacities for different species into a common currency of \"occupied binding sites,\" which is a standard approach in such problems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived and computed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe derivation begins from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\n$1$. The baseline binding capacity, $C_{b}$, is the saturation mass of a reference antibody (human IgG, denoted hIgG) per unit volume of beads, $V_{\\text{beads}}$:\n$$ C_{b} = \\frac{m_{\\text{hIgG, sat}}}{V_{\\text{beads}}} $$\n\n$2$. The relative binding factor, $f_{i}$, for an antibody species $i$ is defined as the ratio of the saturation mass of species $i$ to the saturation mass of the reference human IgG, for the same volume of beads:\n$$ f_{i} = \\frac{m_{i, \\text{sat}}}{m_{\\text{hIgG, sat}}} $$\n\n$3$. From these definitions, we can express the specific binding capacity for species $i$, $C_{b,i}$, which is the saturation mass of species $i$ per unit bead volume:\n$$ C_{b,i} = \\frac{m_{i, \\text{sat}}}{V_{\\text{beads}}} = \\frac{f_{i} \\cdot m_{\\text{hIgG, sat}}}{V_{\\text{beads}}} = f_{i} C_{b} $$\n\n$4$. The beads have a finite number of binding sites. To capture a mixture of different antibody species, we must account for the total capacity they collectively consume. The most rigorous way to do this is to normalize the mass of each antibody species to a common standard, which is the mass of the reference human IgG that would occupy the same number of binding sites. This \"equivalent human IgG mass\" for a given mass $m_i$ of species $i$ is denoted $m_{\\text{hIgG, eq}, i}$. Based on the definition of $f_i$, a mass $m_{i, \\text{sat}}$ of species $i$ occupies the same number of sites as a mass $m_{\\text{hIgG, sat}}$ of human IgG. Therefore, the ratio holds for any non-saturating amount:\n$$ \\frac{m_{\\text{hIgG, eq}, i}}{m_i} = \\frac{m_{\\text{hIgG, sat}}}{m_{i, \\text{sat}}} = \\frac{1}{f_i} $$\nThus, the equivalent human IgG mass load of a mass $m_i$ of species $i$ is:\n$$ m_{\\text{hIgG, eq}, i} = \\frac{m_i}{f_i} $$\n\n$5$. For a cocktail containing $N$ different antibody species, the total demand on the binding capacity, expressed in terms of total equivalent human IgG mass ($M_{\\text{total, eq}}$), is the sum of the equivalent masses of all species present:\n$$ M_{\\text{total, eq}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_{\\text{hIgG, eq}, i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m_i}{f_i} $$\n\n$6$. The actual binding capacity of the beads is reduced from the baseline $C_b$ by several multiplicative factors. Let $R_{\\text{xl}}$ be the crosslinking reduction factor, $R_{\\text{salt}}$ be the high-salt reduction factor, and $F_{\\text{op}}$ be the operational fractional occupancy. The effective, usable binding capacity per unit volume of beads, $C_{\\text{usable}}$, is:\n$$ C_{\\text{usable}} = C_{b} \\cdot R_{\\text{xl}} \\cdot R_{\\text{salt}} \\cdot F_{\\text{op}} $$\nThis represents the maximum allowable load of human IgG equivalents per unit volume of beads under the specified operating conditions.\n\n$7$. To guarantee complete capture of all antibodies, the total available capacity must be equal to or greater than the total load. The minimum bead volume, $V_{\\text{beads, min}}$, is found when the total capacity equals the total load:\n$$ M_{\\text{total, eq}} = C_{\\text{usable}} \\cdot V_{\\text{beads, min}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $M_{\\text{total, eq}}$ and $C_{\\text{usable}}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m_i}{f_i} = (C_{b} \\cdot R_{\\text{xl}} \\cdot R_{\\text{salt}} \\cdot F_{\\text{op}}) \\cdot V_{\\text{beads, min}} $$\n\n$8$. Solving for the minimum bead volume, $V_{\\text{beads, min}}$, gives the general expression:\n$$ V_{\\text{beads, min}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{m_i}{f_i}}{C_{b} \\cdot R_{\\text{xl}} \\cdot R_{\\text{salt}} \\cdot F_{\\text{op}}} $$\nThis is the derived expression from first principles.\n\nNow, we compute the value for the specific IP experiment.\nThe given values are:\n-   $C_{b} = 8.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$\n-   $m_{\\text{rabbit}} = 20 \\, \\mu\\text{g} = 0.020 \\, \\text{mg}$\n-   $m_{\\text{mouse}} = 50 \\, \\mu\\text{g} = 0.050 \\, \\text{mg}$\n-   $f_{\\text{rabbit}} = 1.0$\n-   $f_{\\text{mouse}} = 0.20$\n-   $R_{\\text{xl}} = 1 - 0.12 = 0.88$\n-   $R_{\\text{salt}} = 1 - 0.15 = 0.85$\n-   $F_{\\text{op}} = 0.70$\n\nFirst, calculate the total equivalent human IgG mass load ($M_{\\text{total, eq}}$):\n$$ M_{\\text{total, eq}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{rabbit}}}{f_{\\text{rabbit}}} + \\frac{m_{\\text{mouse}}}{f_{\\text{mouse}}} = \\frac{0.020 \\, \\text{mg}}{1.0} + \\frac{0.050 \\, \\text{mg}}{0.20} $$\n$$ M_{\\text{total, eq}} = 0.020 \\, \\text{mg} + 0.25 \\, \\text{mg} = 0.27 \\, \\text{mg} $$\n\nNext, calculate the effective usable binding capacity per unit volume ($C_{\\text{usable}}$):\n$$ C_{\\text{usable}} = C_{b} \\cdot R_{\\text{xl}} \\cdot R_{\\text{salt}} \\cdot F_{\\text{op}} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{usable}} = (8.0 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}) \\cdot (0.88) \\cdot (0.85) \\cdot (0.70) $$\n$$ C_{\\text{usable}} = 8.0 \\cdot 0.748 \\cdot 0.70 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} = 8.0 \\cdot 0.5236 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} $$\n$$ C_{\\text{usable}} = 4.1888 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} $$\n\nFinally, calculate the minimum bead volume in milliliters:\n$$ V_{\\text{beads, min}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{total, eq}}}{C_{\\text{usable}}} = \\frac{0.27 \\, \\text{mg}}{4.1888 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}} \\approx 0.06445547 \\, \\text{mL} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in microliters ($\\mu$L). We convert from milliliters to microliters ($1$ mL $= 1000$ $\\mu$L):\n$$ V_{\\text{beads, min}} \\approx 0.06445547 \\, \\text{mL} \\times 1000 \\, \\frac{\\mu\\text{L}}{\\text{mL}} \\approx 64.45547 \\, \\mu\\text{L} $$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $64.5 \\, \\mu\\text{L}$.",

Immunoprecipitation, crosslinking chemistry ($\\mathrm{BS}3$, $\\mathrm{DMP}$, $\\mathrm{DSP}$), $\\mathrm{SDS-PAGE}$, and protein-protein interactions are all standard and well-understood concepts. The molecular weights, reagent classes, and buffer conditions are realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem presents a clear objective (minimize antibody contamination) and provides a set of distinct, well-defined protocols to evaluate against this objective. A unique, best-fit solution among the choices can be determined through logical application of the provided principles.\n-   **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology. The constraints and goals are stated quantitatively and operationally.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the detailed analysis and solution.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe central challenge is to elute the $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ target protein from the antibody-bead complex without co-eluting the antibody itself. Under the specified reducing $\\mathrm{SDS-PAGE}$ conditions, any eluted $\\mathrm{IgG}$ will dissociate into its heavy chain ($\\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$) and light chain ($\\approx 25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$), which would interfere with the analysis, especially if the target or interacting partners have similar molecular weights.\n\nThe optimal strategy involves three key components:\n1.  **Immobilization:** The antibody must be permanently attached to the Protein G beads. Since the native Protein G–$\\mathrm{IgG}$ interaction is noncovalent, it is susceptible to disruption by the same harsh conditions that would elute the antigen. Therefore, covalent crosslinking is required.\n2.  **Crosslinker Chemistry:** The covalent bond formed by the crosslinker must be stable under the chosen elution conditions. This means a non-cleavable crosslinker is necessary if elution is to be performed under conditions that would otherwise cleave the linker.\n3.  **Elution Strategy:** The elution conditions must be strong enough to disrupt the noncovalent antibody-antigen interaction but gentle enough to leave the covalent antibody-bead linkage and the bead matrix itself intact.\n\nWe will now evaluate each proposed protocol against these requirements.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Crosslink the antibody captured on Protein G beads using bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3...); elute bound antigen with $0.1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ glycine $\\mathrm{pH}\\,2.5$...Prediction: a dominant band at approximately $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ with no detectable bands at approximately $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ or $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.**\n\n-   **Protocol Analysis:** This protocol uses $\\mathrm{BS3}$, a non-cleavable, amine-reactive crosslinker. $\\mathrm{BS3}$ will form stable amide bonds between primary amines (e.g., lysine residues) on the antibody and the Protein G. These covalent bonds are not susceptible to cleavage by low $\\mathrm{pH}$ or reducing agents. The elution is performed using low $\\mathrm{pH}$ glycine buffer. This condition is specifically designed to disrupt the noncovalent antigen-antibody interaction by protonating key residues, while leaving the covalent antibody-Protein G linkage intact. The subsequent neutralization step helps preserve the eluted antigen's integrity.\n-   **Prediction Analysis:** The predicted outcome is a clean eluate containing the $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ target with minimal to no contamination from the $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ heavy and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ light chains. This is the direct and expected consequence of a successful covalent, non-cleavable crosslinking followed by a selective, gentle elution. The protocol is perfectly designed to meet the primary constraint.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**. The protocol and its predicted outcome are consistent and achieve the stated objective.\n\n**B. Crosslink the antibody captured on Protein G beads using dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP...); elute bound antigen with $0.1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ glycine $\\mathrm{pH}\\,2.5$...Prediction: the $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band plus additional bands at approximately $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.**\n\n-   **Protocol Analysis:** This protocol uses dimethyl pimelimidate ($\\mathrm{DMP}$), which, like $\\mathrm{BS3}$, is a non-cleavable, amine-reactive crosslinker that forms stable bonds. The elution method is also low $\\mathrm{pH}$ glycine. From a chemical standpoint, this protocol is functionally equivalent to protocol A and should also result in minimal antibody contamination.\n-   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction states that significant antibody contamination ($50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ bands) will be present. This prediction is inconsistent with the expected outcome of the described protocol. If the protocol were executed correctly, it should yield a clean eluate. The prediction describes a failed experiment, not an optimized one. Therefore, this option, as a complete package of protocol and prediction, does not represent a solution that meets the stated constraint.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. While the protocol itself is sound, the associated prediction of high contamination indicates it fails to meet the objective.\n\n**C. Do not crosslink; perform immunoprecipitation on Protein G beads and elute by boiling the beads directly in $2\\times$ Laemmli buffer...Prediction: the $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band plus prominent bands at approximately $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.**\n\n-   **Protocol Analysis:** This is a standard, non-crosslinking IP protocol. The elution method involves boiling in $\\mathrm{SDS}$-containing Laemmli buffer. The combination of heat and the strong anionic detergent ($\\mathrm{SDS}$) will denature all proteins and disrupt all noncovalent interactions. This includes the target-antibody interaction AND the antibody-Protein G interaction. Consequently, the antibody will be stripped from the beads along with the target protein. The reducing agent (dithiothreitol, $\\mathrm{DTT}$) will then cleave the inter-chain disulfide bonds of the eluted $\\mathrm{IgG}$.\n-   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction of a $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band alongside prominent $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ bands is entirely accurate for this protocol. However, this outcome represents maximal antibody contamination, which is the exact opposite of the stated objective.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol explicitly violates the primary constraint of the problem.\n\n**D. Crosslink the antibody captured on Protein G beads using dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP...); elute by boiling the beads in $2\\times$ Laemmli buffer containing $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ dithiothreitol...Prediction: the $90\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ band plus bands at approximately $50\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ and $25\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.**\n\n-   **Protocol Analysis:** This protocol uses $\\mathrm{DSP}$, a crosslinker that contains a disulfide bond in its spacer arm. It is therefore cleavable by reducing agents. The elution is performed by boiling in Laemmli buffer containing $\\mathrm{DTT}$. The $\\mathrm{DTT}$ in the elution buffer will cleave the disulfide bond within the $\\mathrm{DSP}$ crosslinker, thereby breaking the covalent link between the antibody and Protein G. The antibody, now released, will be eluted along with the target protein. The $\\mathrm{DTT}$ will also reduce the antibody's own disulfide bonds.\n-   **Prediction Analysis:** The prediction of high antibody contamination is correct. This protocol is designed to fail at its objective; the choice of a reducible crosslinker is nullified by the use of a reducing elution agent. This is a common strategy in crosslinking experiments designed to identify crosslinked partners (by comparing reduced vs. non-reduced samples), but it is entirely inappropriate for preparing a clean eluate for standard $\\mathrm{SDS-PAGE}$.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This protocol guarantees antibody contamination due to the chemical incompatibility of the crosslinker and the elution agent.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nProtocol A is the only option that correctly combines a stable, non-cleavable crosslinker ($\\mathrm{BS}3$) with a selective elution condition (low $\\mathrm{pH}$) that disrupts the antigen-antibody interaction without affecting the covalent antibody-bead linkage. This combination is the standard and most effective method for minimizing antibody contamination in an immunoprecipitation eluate intended for $\\mathrm{SDS-PAGE}$ analysis.",

Assume the following principles and definitions hold:\n\n- Within the linear dynamic range, the integrated band intensity $I$ is proportional to the molar amount $n$ loaded in the lane, with a nonzero intercept due to baseline/background, such that $I = \\alpha n + \\beta$ with constants $\\alpha$ (sensitivity) and $\\beta$ (intercept).\n- Immunoprecipitation efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total input moles of antigen $A$ that are recovered in the IP pellet: $\\varepsilon = \\frac{n_{\\text{pellet,total}}}{n_{\\text{input,total}}}$.\n- Mass balance for $A$ across the IP workflow conserves moles such that $n_{\\text{input,total}} = n_{\\text{pellet,total}} + n_{\\text{supernatant,total}} + n_{\\text{loss}}$, where $n_{\\text{loss}}$ accounts for procedural losses (e.g., incomplete transfer, wash losses).\n- All lanes share equal transfer and detection efficiency, and the calibration applies to the sample lanes.\n\nOn a single blot, the following data are recorded:\n\nCalibration standards (purified $A$ loaded amounts and resulting integrated band intensities):\n- $n = 2\\,\\text{fmol} \\rightarrow I = 38$ arbitrary units (AU)\n- $n = 5\\,\\text{fmol} \\rightarrow I = 92\\,\\text{AU}$\n- $n = 8\\,\\text{fmol} \\rightarrow I = 146\\,\\text{AU}$\n\nSample lanes for the IP experiment (each lane contains a known fraction of the total corresponding fraction volume):\n- Input lane contains a fraction $f_{\\text{in}} = 0.15$ of the total input; measured intensity $I_{\\text{in}} = 128\\,\\text{AU}$.\n- IP pellet lane contains a fraction $f_{\\text{pel}} = 0.25$ of the total pellet; measured intensity $I_{\\text{pel}} = 114\\,\\text{AU}$.\n- IP supernatant lane contains a fraction $f_{\\text{sup}} = 0.10$ of the total supernatant; measured intensity $I_{\\text{sup}} = 36\\,\\text{AU}$.\n\nStarting from the above base principles and definitions, determine the immunoprecipitation efficiency $\\varepsilon$ by:\n\n1. Deriving the calibration relationship $I = \\alpha n + \\beta$ from the calibration standards and solving for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n2. Converting each sample lane intensity to the molar amount present in that lane using the derived calibration.\n3. Scaling by the loaded fractions $f_{\\text{in}}$, $f_{\\text{pel}}$, and $f_{\\text{sup}}$ to obtain $n_{\\text{input,total}}$, $n_{\\text{pellet,total}}$, and $n_{\\text{supernatant,total}}$.\n4. Using the definition $\\varepsilon = \\frac{n_{\\text{pellet,total}}}{n_{\\text{input,total}}}$.\n\nThen briefly check mass balance consistency by evaluating $n_{\\text{loss}}$ from the identity $n_{\\text{input,total}} = n_{\\text{pellet,total}} + n_{\\text{supernatant,total}} + n_{\\text{loss}}$ (no reporting required for $n_{\\text{loss}}$; this check is for internal consistency only).\n\nExpress the final immunoprecipitation efficiency as a unitless decimal. Round your final answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem requires converting Western blot densitometric intensities to molar amounts using a linear calibration, then applying mass balance and the definition of immunoprecipitation (IP) efficiency.\n\nFundamental definitions and assumptions:\n- Within the linear range, intensity is modeled as $I = \\alpha n + \\beta$, where $n$ is moles loaded, $\\alpha$ is proportionality, and $\\beta$ accounts for baseline intensity.\n- IP efficiency is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{n_{\\text{pellet,total}}}{n_{\\text{input,total}}}$.\n- Mass balance is $n_{\\text{input,total}} = n_{\\text{pellet,total}} + n_{\\text{supernatant,total}} + n_{\\text{loss}}$; we use this to check the consistency of our computed amounts.\n\nStep 1: Derive the calibration $I = \\alpha n + \\beta$.\nWe are given three calibration points:\n- $(n, I) = (2, 38)$\n- $(n, I) = (5, 92)$\n- $(n, I) = (8, 146)$\n\nAssuming perfect linearity, solve for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ using two points; we will verify with the third. Using $(2, 38)$ and $(5, 92)$:\nWe have the system\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n38 = \\alpha \\cdot 2 + \\beta \\\\\n92 = \\alpha \\cdot 5 + \\beta\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n$$\n92 - 38 = \\alpha (5 - 2) \\implies 54 = 3\\alpha \\implies \\alpha = 18\\,\\text{AU/fmol}.\n$$\nPlugging $\\alpha$ into $38 = 2\\alpha + \\beta$:\n$$\n38 = 2 \\cdot 18 + \\beta \\implies 38 = 36 + \\beta \\implies \\beta = 2\\,\\text{AU}.\n$$\nVerify with the third point $(8, 146)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{pred}} = \\alpha n + \\beta = 18 \\cdot 8 + 2 = 144 + 2 = 146,\n$$\nwhich matches the observed intensity, confirming internal consistency.
