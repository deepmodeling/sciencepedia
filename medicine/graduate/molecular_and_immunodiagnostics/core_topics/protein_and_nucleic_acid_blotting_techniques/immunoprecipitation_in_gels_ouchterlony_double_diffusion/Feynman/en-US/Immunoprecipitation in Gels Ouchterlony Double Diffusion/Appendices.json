A rigorous way to define this characteristic time is through the mean square displacement of the diffusing particles.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or falsehoods. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe formation of the precipitin line occurs at a location $x^{\\ast}$ and a time $t^{\\ast}$ where the antigen and antibody molecules meet and react. The problem states that the precipitate forms rapidly upon meeting, under conditions of local stoichiometric equivalence. Given that the initial molar concentrations $c_0$ and the available amounts are equal, and the stoichiometry is $1\\!:\\!1$, the equivalence condition is met where the diffusing fronts of the two species first encounter each other.\n\nThe problem directs us to use the scaling of the mean-squared displacement for diffusion. For a one-dimensional random walk, the mean-squared displacement $\\langle x^2 \\rangle$ is related to the diffusion coefficient $D$ and time $t$ by $\\langle x^2 \\rangle = 2Dt$. The characteristic distance $x$ that a diffusion front travels in time $t$ scales as $x \\propto \\sqrt{Dt}$.\n\nLet the antigen well be at position $x=0$ and the antibody well at $x=L$. The precipitin line forms at a position $x^{\\ast}$ (where $0 < x^{\\ast} < L$) at some time $t^{\\ast}$.\nIn this time $t^{\\ast}$, the antigen molecules must diffuse a distance of $x^{\\ast}$. Thus, we can write the scaling relationship:\n$$x^{\\ast} \\propto \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}} t^{\\ast}}$$\nIn the same time interval $t^{\\ast}$, the antibody molecules must diffuse from $x=L$ to $x=x^{\\ast}$, covering a distance of $L - x^{\\ast}$. The scaling for the antibody is:\n$$L - x^{\\ast} \\propto \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}} t^{\\ast}}$$\nWe can express these as equations with a constant of proportionality, $k$:\n$$x^{\\ast} = k \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}} t^{\\ast}}$$\n$$L - x^{\\ast} = k \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}} t^{\\ast}}$$\nTo find the position $x^{\\ast}$, we can eliminate the unknown time $t^{\\ast}$ and the constant $k$ by taking the ratio of the two equations:\n$$\\frac{x^{\\ast}}{L - x^{\\ast}} = \\frac{k \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}} t^{\\ast}}}{k \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}} t^{\\ast}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}}$$\nNow, we solve this equation for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$x^{\\ast} \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}} = (L - x^{\\ast}) \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}$$\n$$x^{\\ast} \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}} = L \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} - x^{\\ast} \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}$$\n$$x^{\\ast} (\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}) = L \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}$$\nThis gives the analytic expression for the position of the precipitin line:\n$$x^{\\ast} = L \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}}$$\n\nNext, we derive the displacement from the geometric midpoint of the wells, $\\Delta$. The midpoint is at $\\frac{L}{2}$.\n$$\\Delta = x^{\\ast} - \\frac{L}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\Delta = L \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} - \\frac{L}{2}$$\nTo combine these terms, we find a common denominator:\n$$\\Delta = L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = L \\left( \\frac{2\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} - (\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}})}{2(\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}})} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the numerator gives the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = L \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} - \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}}{2(\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}})} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem then asks for the dimensionless fraction $\\frac{\\Delta}{L}$. Dividing the expression for $\\Delta$ by $L$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{L} = \\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} - \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}}{2(\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}} + \\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}})}$$\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this fraction for the case where the ratio of diffusion coefficients is $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}} = 1.5$. To facilitate this, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator of our expression for $\\frac{\\Delta}{L}$ by $\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{L} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} - 1}{2\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}}{\\sqrt{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} - 1}{2\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}}} + 1\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical value $\\frac{D_{\\mathrm{Ag}}}{D_{\\mathrm{Ab}}} = 1.5$:\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{L} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1.5} - 1}{2(\\sqrt{1.5} + 1)}$$\nNow, we compute the value:\n$$\\sqrt{1.5} \\approx 1.22474487$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{L} \\approx \\frac{1.22474487 - 1}{2(1.22474487 + 1)} = \\frac{0.22474487}{2(2.22474487)} = \\frac{0.22474487}{4.44948974}$$\n$$\\frac{\\Delta}{L} \\approx 0.0505103$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $0.05051$.",

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity. The setup is a classic textbook example used to teach immunodiffusion principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe Ouchterlony double diffusion assay reveals the relationship between antigens based on their reactions with a common antiserum. The patterns observed are categorized as identity, partial identity, or non-identity. The central antiserum well $S$ contains a polyclonal repertoire of antibodies, $R_S$, raised against antigen $B$. Given $E_B = E_A \\cup E_C \\cup U$, the antiserum $R_S$ contains antibodies specific for epitopes in $E_A$, $E_C$, and $U$. Let us denote these antibody populations as anti-$E_A$, anti-$E_C$, and anti-$U$.\n\nWe must analyze the three pairwise interactions between the adjacent antigen wells, mediated by the central antiserum.\n\n### 1. Analysis of the $A$ vs $B$ Interaction\n- **Antigen Well A**: Contains epitopes $E_A$.\n- **Antigen Well B**: Contains epitopes $E_B = E_A \\cup E_C \\cup U$.\n- **Antiserum S**: Contains antibodies anti-$E_A$, anti-$E_C$, and anti-$U$.\n\nThe antibodies anti-$E_A$ from well $S$ will react with both antigen $A$ (from well $A$) and antigen $B$ (from well $B$, which contains $E_A$). This shared reaction creates a precipitin line. Because the antigen-antibody system (antigen $A$ / anti-$E_A$) is shared, the precipitin lines formed by each antigen will fuse, indicating that antigen $A$ is antigenically related to antigen $B$.\n\nHowever, the relationship is not one of full identity. Antigen $B$ possesses additional epitopes ($E_C$ and $U$) that are not present in antigen $A$. The antiserum $S$ also contains the corresponding antibodies (anti-$E_C$ and anti-$U$). These antibodies will not react with antigen $A$ and will diffuse past the point of equivalence for the $A$-anti-$E_A$ system. They will, however, encounter and precipitate with the corresponding epitopes $E_C$ and $U$ diffusing from well $B$. This additional reaction forms a secondary precipitin arc that extends from the fused primary line. This extension is known as a \"spur\".\n\nThe pattern is thus one of **partial identity**. The spur is formed by the reaction unique to the more antigenically complex reactant. Here, antigen $B$ is more complex than antigen $A$. The spur points toward the well containing the simpler antigen, as the antibodies forming the spur (anti-$E_C$ and anti-$U$) are not consumed by the simpler antigen ($A$).\nTherefore, the pattern between $A$ and $B$ is partial identity with a spur pointing toward well $A$.\n\n### 2. Analysis of the $B$ vs $C$ Interaction\n- **Antigen Well C**: Contains epitopes $E_C$.\n- **Antigen Well B**: Contains epitopes $E_B = E_A \\cup E_C \\cup U$.\n- **Antiserum S**: Contains antibodies anti-$E_A$, anti-$E_C$, and anti-$U$.\n\nThis situation is analogous to the $A$ vs $B$ interaction. The antibodies anti-$E_C$ will react with both antigen $C$ and antigen $B$, leading to a fused precipitin line. Antigen $B$ is again the more complex antigen, possessing epitopes $E_A$ and $U$ that are absent in antigen $C$. The corresponding antibodies, anti-$E_A$ and anti-$U$, will diffuse past the $C$-anti-$E_C$ reaction front and react with antigen $B$ to form a spur.\n\nThe pattern is one of **partial identity**. The spur points toward the well containing the simpler antigen, which is $C$.\nTherefore, the pattern between $B$ and $C$ is partial identity with a spur pointing toward well $C$.\n\n### 3. Analysis of the $A$ vs $C$ Interaction\n- **Antigen Well A**: Contains epitopes $E_A$.\n- **Antigen Well C**: Contains epitopes $E_C$.\n- **Antiserum S**: Contains antibodies anti-$E_A$, anti-$E_C$, and anti-$U$.\n\nThe problem states that $E_A \\cap E_C = \\varnothing$, meaning antigens $A$ and $C$ share no common epitopes. Consequently, they will react with different populations of antibodies in the antiserum $S$.\n- Antigen $A$ will react with anti-$E_A$ antibodies.\n- Antigen $C$ will react with anti-$E_C$ antibodies.\n\nThese two antigen-antibody systems are independent. They will each form their own precipitin line at their respective zones of equivalence. Since there is no shared component, the lines will diffuse through each other without interaction, forming a pattern of two crossed arcs. This is the classic pattern of **non-identity**.\n\n### Summary of Predictions:\n- **$A$ vs $B$**: Partial identity, spur points toward $A$.\n- **$B$ vs $C$**: Partial identity, spur points toward $C$.\n- **$A$ vs $C$**: Non-identity, lines cross.\n\n## Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $A$ vs $B$: partial identity with the fused line and a spur pointing toward $A$; $B$ vs $C$: partial identity with the fused line and a spur pointing toward $C$; $A$ vs $C$: non-identity with two independent arcs crossing.**\n- This statement accurately describes all three predicted interactions:\n    - $A$ vs $B$: Partial identity, spur towards simpler antigen $A$.

Incorrect. The spur points toward $A$.\n- $B$ vs $C$: States \"spur pointing toward $B$\". Incorrect. The spur points toward $C$.\n- $A$ vs $C$: States \"identity\". Incorrect. Their epitope sets are disjoint ($E_A \\cap E_C = \\varnothing$), resulting in non-identity. The reasoning provided is also flawed; the relationship of $A$ and $C$ to a third antigen $B$ does not imply identity between $A$ and $C$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $A$ vs $B$: non-identity; $B$ vs $C$: partial identity with a spur pointing toward $C$; $A$ vs $C$: non-identity.**\n- $A$ vs $B$: States \"non-identity\". This is incorrect. They share epitopes $E_A$, resulting in partial identity.\n- $B$ vs $C$: States \"partial identity with a spur pointing toward $C$\". This is correct.\n- $A$ vs $C$: States \"non-identity\". This is correct.\n- Overall, the option is incorrect due to the first error.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. $A$ vs $B$: partial identity with a spur pointing toward $A$; $B$ vs $C$: identity with complete fusion and no spur; $A$ vs $C$: non-identity.**\n- $A$ vs $B$: States \"partial identity with a spur pointing toward $A$\". This is correct.\n- $B$ vs $C$: States \"identity\". This is incorrect. The relationship is partial identity because $E_C \\subset E_B$ and $E_B$ contains additional epitopes.\n- $A$ vs $C$: States \"non-identity\". This is correct.\n- Overall, the option is incorrect due to the error in the $B$ vs $C$ description.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nThe only option that correctly describes all three resulting patterns is A.",
