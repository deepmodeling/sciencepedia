            "problem": "In the field of immunology, Mass Cytometry, also known as Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight (CyTOF), is a powerful technique for high-dimensional single-cell analysis. During sample preparation, a researcher treats a suspension of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a cocktail of metal-isotope-tagged antibodies and a DNA intercalator. The DNA intercalator is a molecule that stoichiometrically binds to DNA, meaning the signal intensity from the metal isotope on the intercalator is directly proportional to the total amount of DNA within a particle passing the detector.\n\nThe instrument analyzes particles one by one, recording them as \"events.\" For each event, the machine measures the intensity of all metal tags as well as a parameter called \"event length,\" which is a proxy for the time the event takes to pass through the plasma in the detector. A critical data-cleaning step is \"doublet discrimination,\" which aims to exclude events that consist of two or more cells stuck together (doublets or aggregates) from the analysis of single cells (singlets).\n\nTo achieve this, the researcher generates a two-dimensional plot of the DNA intercalator signal (y-axis) versus the event length (x-axis). Given that most cells in the sample are non-proliferating and are in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, which of the following statements most accurately describes how this plot is used to identify the main population of single cells?\n\nA. Single cells form a concentrated population with a characteristic DNA intercalator signal and a correspondingly narrow distribution of event lengths, whereas doublets have approximately double the DNA signal and a longer event length.\n\nB. Single cells are identified as the population with the lowest event length, as this indicates they are the smallest particles, while the DNA intercalator signal is used to determine their activation state.\n\nC. Single cells form a population with a high event length but a low DNA intercalator signal, while doublets have a low event length and a high DNA intercalator signal.\n\nD. The event length parameter is primarily used to distinguish live cells from dead cells based on their size, and the DNA intercalator signal is used to identify different cell lineages (e.g., T cells vs. B cells).\n\nE. Doublets are identified as a population having roughly the same DNA intercalator signal as singlets but a significantly longer event length, reflecting their elongated shape.",
            "solution": "Define the following per event: let $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ be the DNA intercalator signal intensity, $L$ the event length, and $N_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ the total DNA content within the event. By stoichiometric binding of the intercalator to DNA, the signal is directly proportional to DNA content:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{DNA}}=k\\,N_{\\mathrm{DNA}},\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a proportionality constant determined by staining and detection conditions.\n\nFor a single non-proliferating cell in G0/G1, denote its DNA content by $N_{0}$. Then its expected signal is\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{singlet}}=k\\,N_{0}.\n$$\nBecause cells in G0/G1 dominate the sample, these singlets form a concentrated population at $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}\\approx kN_{0}$ with a relatively narrow spread in both $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ (biological and technical variability) and $L$ (a consistent transit duration for single cells).\n\nA doublet comprising two G0/G1 cells has total DNA content approximately\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{doublet}}\\approx 2N_{0} \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad S_{\\mathrm{doublet}}\\approx 2k\\,N_{0}.\n$$\nIn addition, two cells passing together constitute a larger/longer event, so the event length increases:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{doublet}}>L_{\\mathrm{singlet}}.\n$$\nTherefore, on a plot of $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ (y-axis) versus $L$ (x-axis), the main singlet population appears as a tight cluster at $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}\\approx kN_{0}$ with a relatively narrow $L$ distribution, while doublets (or aggregates) shift upwards (higher $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$) and rightwards (longer $L$).\n\nA useful corollary is that true G2/M singlets (proliferating cells) also have approximately doubled DNA content ($\\approx 2N_{0}$) and thus $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}\\approx 2kN_{0}$, but they typically maintain a singlet-like $L$. Hence, using $L$ helps discriminate doublets (high $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$, high $L$) from G2/M singlets (high $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$, normal $L$).\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A matches the proportionality $S_{\\mathrm{doublet}}\\approx 2S_{\\mathrm{singlet}}$ and the expectation $L_{\\mathrm{doublet}}>L_{\\mathrm{singlet}}$, and correctly describes a concentrated singlet cluster with narrow $L$.\n- B is incorrect: lowest $L$ alone is not a reliable singlet criterion, and the DNA intercalator reports DNA content, not activation state.\n- C is incorrect: it reverses the relationship between singlets/doublets and both $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ and $L$.\n- D is incorrect: event length is not primarily a live/dead discriminator, and DNA intercalator does not identify lineages.\n- E is incorrect: doublets generally have higher, not similar, $S_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$ compared to singlets due to summed DNA content.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.",

A key challenge is minimizing signal spillover, where signal from one metal channel artifactually appears in another.

            "problem": "A mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF; Cytometry by Time-Of-Flight) experiment uses a $40$-marker antibody panel with metal isotopes assigned to distinct mass channels. In CyTOF, two well-tested sources of analytical interference are oxide formation, which shifts signal from a mass $m$ to $m+16$, and isotopic impurity, which leaks a fraction of signal from a mass $m$ to its adjacent masses $m \\pm 1$. These interferences are summarized in an interference matrix whose entries are fractional contributions $s_{i \\to j}$ from channel $i$ into channel $j$.\n\nConsider a highly co-expressed pair of markers $A$ and $B$ currently assigned to masses $m_A = 159$ and $m_B = 175$, respectively. The relevant entries of the interference matrix for these channels are:\n- Oxide formation from $m_A = 159$ into $m_A + 16 = 175$: $s_{A \\to B}^{\\text{oxide}} = 0.013$.\n- Second-order oxide (dioxide) from $m_A = 159$ into $m_A + 32 = 191$: $s_{A \\to 191}^{\\text{dioxide}} = 0.0009$.\n- Isotopic impurity from $m_A = 159$ into $m_A + 1 = 160$: $s_{A \\to 160}^{\\text{iso}} = 0.0028$.\n- All other direct contributions between $A$ and $B$ are negligible compared to the above and can be considered zero for this calculation.\n\nIn a specific cell population where $A$ and $B$ are co-expressed, the mean true intensities are $x_A = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}$ counts per cell and $x_B = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$ counts per cell. For the current assignment, assume the expected spillover contaminating marker $B$ from marker $A$ is the additive fraction $s_{A \\to B} x_A$ in the $B$ channel relative to the true $B$ intensity $x_B$.\n\nCompute the expected spillover fraction in the $B$ channel due to $A$ under the current assignment. Then, to minimize confounding, consider two reassignment options for marker $B$: reassign $B$ to $m_{B}' = 160$ or to $m_{B}'' = 191$. Using only the oxide and isotopic impurity entries given above, determine which reassignment yields the smaller expected spillover fraction from $A$, and compute the fold-reduction factor $R$ defined by\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\text{spillover fraction into } B \\text{ at } m_B = 175}{\\text{spillover fraction into } B \\text{ at the optimal reassigned mass}}.\n$$\nExpress $R$ as a decimal number and round your final answer to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically and mathematically well-posed. All necessary data and definitions are provided to compute a unique solution.\n\nThe primary quantity of interest is the spillover fraction, which we denote as $F$. The problem defines this as the ratio of the interfering signal from a source channel (marker $A$) in a target channel (marker $B$) to the true signal in the target channel. Let $x_A$ and $x_B$ be the true mean intensities of markers $A$ and $B$, respectively. Let $s_{A \\to B}$ be the fractional contribution (spillover coefficient) from the mass channel of $A$ into the mass channel of $B$. The spillover fraction is given by:\n$$\nF = \\frac{s_{A \\to B} x_A}{x_B}\n$$\nWe are given the true intensities $x_A = 3.6 \\times 10^4$ counts and $x_B = 3.0 \\times 10^4$ counts. The ratio of these intensities is a constant factor in our calculations:\n$$\n\\frac{x_A}{x_B} = \\frac{3.6 \\times 10^4}{3.0 \\times 10^4} = 1.2\n$$\nThus, the spillover fraction is directly proportional to the spillover coefficient, $F = 1.2 \\cdot s_{A \\to B}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the spillover fraction for the current antibody panel assignment.\nMarker $A$ is at mass $m_A = 159$ Da and marker $B$ is at $m_B = 175$ Da. The interference is from oxide formation, where signal from mass $m$ spills into $m+16$. Here, $m_A + 16 = 159 + 16 = 175$, which is a direct spillover into the channel for marker $B$.\nThe given spillover coefficient is $s_{A \\to B}^{\\text{oxide}} = s_{159 \\to 175} = 0.013$.\nThe spillover fraction for the current assignment, $F_{\\text{current}}$, is:\n$$\nF_{\\text{current}} = \\frac{s_{159 \\to 175} \\cdot x_A}{x_B} = 0.013 \\times 1.2 = 0.0156\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the two reassignment options for marker $B$ to determine which one minimizes the spillover fraction from marker $A$.\n\nOption 1: Reassign marker $B$ to mass $m_B' = 160$ Da.\nThe interference pathway is isotopic impurity from marker $A$, where signal from mass $m_A=159$ spills into $m_A+1 = 160$.\nThe given spillover coefficient for this pathway is $s_{A \\to 160}^{\\text{iso}} = 0.0028$.\nThe spillover fraction for this assignment, $F_{160}$, would be:\n$$\nF_{160} = \\frac{s_{159 \\to 160} \\cdot x_A}{x_B} = 0.0028 \\times 1.2 = 0.00336\n$$\n\nOption 2: Reassign marker $B$ to mass $m_B'' = 191$ Da.\nThe interference pathway is second-order oxide (dioxide) formation from marker $A$, where signal from mass $m_A=159$ spills into $m_A+32 = 191$.\nThe given spillover coefficient for this pathway is $s_{A \\to 191}^{\\text{dioxide}} = 0.0009$.\nThe spillover fraction for this assignment, $F_{191}$, would be:\n$$\nF_{191} = \\frac{s_{159 \\to 191} \\cdot x_A}{x_B} = 0.0009 \\times 1.2 = 0.00108\n$$\n\nTo find the optimal reassignment, we compare the spillover fractions of the two options:\n$$\nF_{160} = 0.00336 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad F_{191} = 0.00108\n$$\nSince $0.00108 < 0.00336$, reassigning marker $B$ to the mass channel $m_B'' = 191$ Da results in a smaller spillover fraction. The optimal (minimal) spillover fraction is therefore $F_{\\text{opt}} = F_{191} = 0.00108$.\n\nFinally, we compute the fold-reduction factor $R$, defined as the ratio of the spillover fraction in the current assignment to the spillover fraction in the optimal reassigned configuration.\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\text{spillover fraction at } m_B = 175}{\\text{spillover fraction at the optimal reassigned mass}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{current}}}{F_{\\text{opt}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the fractions:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{s_{159 \\to 175} \\cdot x_A}{x_B}}{\\frac{s_{159 \\to 191} \\cdot x_A}{x_B}} = \\frac{s_{159 \\to 175}}{s_{159 \\to 191}}\n$$\nThe factor $\\frac{x_A}{x_B}$ cancels, meaning the fold-reduction is independent of the specific expression levels of the markers, and depends only on the relative spillover coefficients.\nPlugging in the numerical values for the coefficients:\n$$\nR = \\frac{0.013}{0.0009} = \\frac{13 \\times 10^{-3}}{9 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{130}{9}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nR = 14.4444...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR \\approx 14.44\n$$",

In mass cytometry, antibodies are conjugated to distinct metal isotopes, and single-cell events are quantified as metal-ion signal intensities. After acquisition, signals are transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine function to stabilize variance, with a cofactor $c=5$, yielding transformed intensities $\\arcsinh(I/c)$ that are empirically well-approximated by Gaussian distributions for both antigen-negative and antigen-positive populations. To minimize false positives in the antigen-negative population, the laboratory adopts a fixed gating rule based on the normal distribution: an event is called positive if its transformed intensity exceeds the threshold at $2$ negative standard deviations above the negative mean.\n\nStarting from the properties of a Gaussian-distributed antigen-negative population with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$, and a Gaussian-distributed antigen-positive population with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}}$, define a sensitivity-oriented separation metric, the staining index, as the normalized mean separation relative to the $2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ gating width.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of mass cytometry data analysis, well-posed with a clear definition and sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main outputs: first, the derivation of a closed-form analytic expression for a staining index, and second, the calculation of this index for three specific antibodies.\n\nThe transformed signal intensities are assumed to follow Gaussian distributions. The antigen-negative population is described by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$.

All parameters are given in the arcsinh-transformed scale.\n\nThe problem defines the staining index ($SI$) as \"the normalized mean separation relative to the $2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ gating width\". We will derive the expression for this metric by formalizing this definition.\n\nFirst, \"mean separation\" refers to the difference between the mean of the positive population and the mean of the negative population. This is expressed mathematically as:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu = \\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}}\n$$\n\nSecond, the definition specifies that this separation should be normalized \"relative to the $2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ gating width\". The problem context establishes this \"gating width\" by defining a threshold at $2$ negative standard deviations above the negative mean. The term $2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$ is explicitly stated as the reference for normalization. Therefore, the normalization factor is $2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}$.\n\nCombining these two components, the staining index ($SI$) is the ratio of the mean separation to the normalization factor:\n$$\nSI = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{pos}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{neg}}}{2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{neg}}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the staining index as defined in the problem. This metric quantifies the separation of the two population means in units of twice the negative population's standard deviation.
