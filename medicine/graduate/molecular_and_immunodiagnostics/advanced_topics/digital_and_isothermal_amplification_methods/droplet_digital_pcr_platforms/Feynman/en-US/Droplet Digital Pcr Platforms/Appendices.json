Two parallel ddPCR reactions are performed under identical conditions, each partitioning the reaction mixture into $n = 20{,}000$ droplets of equal volume. The observed number of positive droplets is $k_t = 8000$ for the target assay and $k_r = 10{,}000$ for the reference assay. Assume that, for each assay, template molecules are randomly partitioned across droplets according to a Poisson model with per-droplet mean occupancy $\\lambda$ and that a droplet is called positive if it contains one or more template molecules.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the copy number variation (CNV) ratio and its standard error from droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) data. The solution proceeds in several steps: first, deriving the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the per-droplet mean template occupancy ($\\lambda$); second, constructing the estimator for the ratio $\\rho = \\lambda_t / \\lambda_r$; third, deriving the asymptotic variance of these estimators using the delta method; and finally, calculating the numerical values for the given data.\n\n### Step 1: Maximum Likelihood Estimator for $\\lambda$\n\nFor a single ddPCR assay, the total number of droplets is $n$, and the observed number of positive droplets is $k$. The partitioning of template molecules is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. The probability that a given droplet contains zero template molecules is $P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of molecules per droplet. A droplet is positive if it contains at least one molecule. Therefore, the probability $p$ that a droplet is positive is:\n$$p = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThe number of positive droplets $k$ out of a total of $n$ independent droplets follows a binomial distribution, $K \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p)$. The likelihood function for observing $k$ positive droplets is:\n$$L(p|k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\nSubstituting $p = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$ and $1-p = \\exp(-\\lambda)$, we can write the likelihood in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$L(\\lambda|k) = \\binom{n}{k} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda))^k (\\exp(-\\lambda))^{n-k} = \\binom{n}{k} (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda))^k \\exp(-\\lambda(n-k))$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for $\\lambda$, we maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\lambda) = \\ln(L(\\lambda|k))$:\n$$\\ell(\\lambda) = \\ln\\binom{n}{k} + k \\ln(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)) - \\lambda(n-k)$$\nWe differentiate $\\ell(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\lambda} = k \\left(\\frac{\\exp(-\\lambda)}{1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)}\\right) - (n-k) = 0$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$k \\exp(-\\lambda) = (n-k)(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda))$$\n$$k \\exp(-\\lambda) = n - k - (n-k)\\exp(-\\lambda)$$\n$$(k + n - k)\\exp(-\\lambda) = n - k$$\n$$n \\exp(-\\lambda) = n - k$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) = \\frac{n-k}{n} = 1 - \\frac{k}{n}$$\n$$\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\text{MLE}} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{k}{n}\\right)$$\nThis is the MLE for the average number of molecules per droplet.\n\n### Step 2: Estimator for the CNV Ratio $\\rho$\n\nThe CNV ratio is defined as $\\rho = \\lambda_t / \\lambda_r$. By the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE for a function of parameters is the function of the MLEs of those parameters. Therefore, the estimator for the ratio $\\rho$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\rho} = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}_t}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r} = \\frac{-\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{k_t}{n}\\right)}{-\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{k_r}{n}\\right)}$$\nwhere $k_t$ and $k_r$ are the positive droplet counts for the target and reference assays, respectively.\n\n### Step 3: Asymptotic Standard Error of $\\hat{\\rho}$\n\nTo find the standard error of $\\hat{\\rho}$, we use the delta method for propagation of uncertainty. For a ratio of two independent random variables $X$ and $Y$, the relative variance of the ratio $R = X/Y$ is approximately the sum of the relative variances of $X$ and $Y$:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\rho})}{\\hat{\\rho}^2} \\approx \\frac{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_t)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_t^2} + \\frac{\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}_r)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r^2}$$\nThis requires us to first find the variance of the estimator $\\hat{\\lambda}$. We apply the delta method to $\\hat{\\lambda} = f(k/n) = -\\ln(1-k/n)$. The variance of $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is approximately:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx \\left( f'\\left(E\\left[\\frac{k}{n}\\right]\\right) \\right)^2 \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)$$\nHere, $E[k/n] = p$ and $\\text{Var}(k/n) = \\frac{1}{n^2}\\text{Var}(k) = \\frac{np(1-p)}{n^2} = \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}$. The derivative of $f(x) = -\\ln(1-x)$ is $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x}$. Evaluated at $x=p$, this is $\\frac{1}{1-p}$.\nSubstituting these into the variance approximation:\n$$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{1-p}\\right)^2 \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} = \\frac{p}{n(1-p)}$$\nTo get a practical estimator for this variance, we substitute the sample proportion $\\hat{p} = k/n$ for the true probability $p$:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}) = \\frac{k/n}{n(1-k/n)} = \\frac{k}{n^2(n-k)/n} = \\frac{k}{n(n-k)}$$\nNow we can construct the estimator for the variance of $\\hat{\\rho}$:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\rho}) = \\hat{\\rho}^2 \\left( \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_t)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_t^2} + \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_r)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r^2} \\right)$$\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\rho}) = \\left( \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}_t}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r} \\right)^2 \\left( \\frac{k_t}{n(n-k_t)\\hat{\\lambda}_t^2} + \\frac{k_r}{n(n-k_r)\\hat{\\lambda}_r^2} \\right)$$\nThe standard error of $\\hat{\\rho}$, denoted $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho})$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) = \\sqrt{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\rho})} = |\\hat{\\rho}| \\sqrt{ \\frac{k_t}{n(n-k_t)\\hat{\\lambda}_t^2} + \\frac{k_r}{n(n-k_r)\\hat{\\lambda}_r^2} }$$\n\n### Step 4: Numerical Calculation\n\nThe given data are:\n- Total droplets: $n = 20000$\n- Target positive droplets: $k_t = 8000$\n- Reference positive droplets: $k_r = 10000$\n\nFirst, calculate the MLEs for $\\lambda_t$ and $\\lambda_r$:\n$$\\hat{\\lambda}_t = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{8000}{20000}\\right) = -\\ln(1 - 0.4) = -\\ln(0.6) \\approx 0.5108256$$\n$$\\hat{\\lambda}_r = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{10000}{20000}\\right) = -\\ln(1 - 0.5) = -\\ln(0.5) \\approx 0.6931472$$\n\nNext, calculate the estimated CNV ratio $\\hat{\\rho}$:\n$$\\hat{\\rho} = \\frac{\\hat{\\lambda}_t}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r} \\approx \\frac{0.5108256}{0.6931472} \\approx 0.7369656$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\hat{\\rho} \\approx 0.7370$.\n\nNow, calculate the estimated variances for $\\hat{\\lambda}_t$ and $\\hat{\\lambda}_r$:\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_t) = \\frac{k_t}{n(n-k_t)} = \\frac{8000}{20000(20000 - 8000)} = \\frac{8000}{20000 \\cdot 12000} = \\frac{1}{30000}$$\n$$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_r) = \\frac{k_r}{n(n-k_r)} = \\frac{10000}{20000(20000 - 10000)} = \\frac{10000}{20000 \\cdot 10000} = \\frac{1}{20000}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the standard error of the ratio, $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho})$:\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) = |\\hat{\\rho}| \\sqrt{ \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_t)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_t^2} + \\frac{\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\lambda}_r)}{\\hat{\\lambda}_r^2} }$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.7369656 \\sqrt{ \\frac{1/30000}{(0.5108256)^2} + \\frac{1/20000}{(0.6931472)^2} }$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.7369656 \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{30000 \\cdot 0.2609428} + \\frac{1}{20000 \\cdot 0.4804530} }$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.7369656 \\sqrt{ 1.27741 \\times 10^{-4} + 1.04068 \\times 10^{-4} }$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.7369656 \\sqrt{ 2.31809 \\times 10^{-4} }$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.7369656 \\cdot 0.0152253$$\n$$\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.0112205$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\rho}) \\approx 0.01122$.\n\nThe CNV ratio is approximately $0.7370$ with a standard error of approximately $0.01122$.",

The expected number of false-positive droplets is:\n$$E[X] = N \\cdot P_{FP} \\approx 20000 \\cdot (1.2666 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 0.2533$$\n\nSince $N$ is large and $P_{FP}$ is very small, the binomial distribution of $X$ is well-approximated by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu = E[X] \\approx 0.2533$.\n$$X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu), \\quad \\text{where } \\mu \\approx 0.2533$$\nThe probability mass function is $P(X=k) = \\frac{\\mu^k e^{-\\mu}}{k!}$.\n\nWe need to find the minimum integer threshold $T$ such that the probability of observing $T$ or more false positives is at most $\\alpha = 0.001$.\n$$P(X \\ge T) \\le \\alpha$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimum integer $T$ such that:\n$$P(X \\le T-1) \\ge 1 - \\alpha = 1 - 0.001 = 0.999$$\n\nLet's compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu \\approx 0.2533)$:\n$P(X=0) = \\frac{\\mu^0 e^{-\\mu}}{0!} = e^{-0.2533} \\approx 0.77623$\n$P(X \\le 0) \\approx 0.77623$\n\n$P(X=1) = \\frac{\\mu^1 e^{-\\mu}}{1!} = \\mu e^{-\\mu} \\approx 0.2533 \\times 0.77623 \\approx 0.19665$\n$P(X \\le 1) = P(X \\le 0) + P(X=1) \\approx 0.77623 + 0.19665 = 0.97288$\n\n$P(X=2) = \\frac{\\mu^2 e^{-\\mu}}{2!} \\approx \\frac{(0.2533)^2}{2} \\times 0.77623 \\approx 0.02489$\n$P(X \\le 2) = P(X \\le 1) + P(X=2) \\approx 0.97288 + 0.02489 = 0.99777$\n\n$P(X=3) = \\frac{\\mu^3 e^{-\\mu}}{3!} \\approx \\frac{(0.2533)^3}{6} \\times 0.77623 \\approx 0.00210$\n$P(X \\le 3) = P(X \\le 2) + P(X=3) \\approx 0.99777 + 0.00210 = 0.99987$\n\nWe seek the smallest integer $T$ such that $P(X \\le T-1) \\ge 0.999$.\nFor $T=1$: $P(X \\le 0) \\approx 0.776  0.999$.\nFor $T=2$: $P(X \\le 1) \\approx 0.973  0.999$.\nFor $T=3$: $P(X \\le 2) \\approx 0.998  0.999$.\nFor $T=4$: $P(X \\le 3) \\approx 0.99987 > 0.999$.\n\nThe condition is met for $T-1=3$, which means the minimum integer threshold is $T=4$.\nTo verify, let's check the type I error for $T=4$:\n$P(X \\ge 4) = 1 - P(X \\le 3) \\approx 1 - 0.99987 = 0.00013$.\nSince $0.00013 \\le 0.001$, the threshold $T=4$ is correct.\nFor $T=3$, the type I error would be $P(X \\ge 3) = 1 - P(X \\le 2) \\approx 1 - 0.99777 = 0.00223$, which is greater than $\\alpha=0.001$.\nTherefore, the minimum integer threshold is $4$.",
