            "introduction": "The quality of a humoral immune response is determined not only by the quantity of antibodies produced but also by their isotype composition. Different isotypes engage distinct effector pathways, and their relative abundance dictates the overall functional outcome. This practice illustrates how to translate complex immunodiagnostic data—in this case, serum isotype proportions—into a single, clinically relevant metric using a simple yet powerful weighted model to predict the potential for Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) .",

            "problem": "An advanced immunodiagnostic evaluation of antigen-specific humoral responses is performed in a murine model to estimate the coordination of effector routing toward Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC). Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) is operationally defined as an effector mechanism requiring Fc receptor engagement by antibody Fc domains on cytotoxic effector cells, such as Natural Killer (NK) cells, and is influenced by immunoglobulin (Ig) isotype composition and Fc receptor affinity. A bead-based multiplex assay quantifies antigen-specific serum isotype proportions as follows: Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) $60\\%$, Immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) $10\\%$, Immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) $20\\%$, and Immunoglobulin A (IgA) $10\\%$. \n\nTo translate these measurements into a scalar routing score toward ADCC, assume the following foundational principles:\n1. Each isotype contributes independently to the expected ADCC routing in proportion to its measured abundance.\n2. The efficacy of each isotype in driving ADCC is captured by a dimensionless, normalized weight that reflects its relative capacity to engage activating Fc receptors on effector cells under standardized conditions.\n3. The composite routing score is the additive combination of these independent contributions.\n\nGiven normalized weights $w_{1}=1$ for IgG1, $w_{2}=1.5$ for IgG2a, $w_{3}=1.2$ for IgG3, and $w_{A}=0.5$ for IgA, compute the unitless ADCC routing score $S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}}$ using the above principles, where isotype proportions are used as fractions rather than percentages. Express your final $S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}}$ as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in established immunological principles concerning Antibody-Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC), its mediation by different immunoglobulin isotypes, and their engagement of Fc receptors. The problem is well-posed, providing a self-contained, mathematically explicit model with all necessary parameters for calculating a defined metric, the ADCC routing score. There are no logical contradictions, factual inaccuracies, or ambiguities.\n\nThe objective is to compute the unitless ADCC routing score, $S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}}$, based on the provided principles and data. The principles state that the composite score is the additive combination of independent contributions from each isotype, where each contribution is the product of the isotype's fractional abundance and its specific efficacy weight.\n\nThis model is formalized as a weighted sum. Let $p_i$ represent the fractional proportion of isotype $i$ and $w_i$ be its corresponding dimensionless weight. The score $S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}}$ is calculated as:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = \\sum_{i} p_i w_i$$\n\nThe problem provides the proportions of four antigen-specific isotypes and their corresponding weights. We convert the given percentages to fractional proportions for the calculation.\n\nThe provided data are:\n- For Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1): proportion $p_{1} = 60\\% = 0.60$, weight $w_{1} = 1.0$.\n- For Immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a): proportion $p_{2} = 10\\% = 0.10$, weight $w_{2} = 1.5$.\n- For Immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3): proportion $p_{3} = 20\\% = 0.20$, weight $w_{3} = 1.2$.\n- For Immunoglobulin A (IgA): proportion $p_{A} = 10\\% = 0.10$, weight $w_{A} = 0.5$.\n\nWe substitute these values into the summation formula:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = p_{1}w_{1} + p_{2}w_{2} + p_{3}w_{3} + p_{A}w_{A}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = (0.60)(1.0) + (0.10)(1.5) + (0.20)(1.2) + (0.10)(0.5)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the value of each term in the sum, which represents the weighted contribution of each isotype:\n- Contribution from IgG1: $0.60 \\times 1.0 = 0.60$\n- Contribution from IgG2a: $0.10 \\times 1.5 = 0.15$\n- Contribution from IgG3: $0.20 \\times 1.2 = 0.24$\n- Contribution from IgA: $0.10 \\times 0.5 = 0.05$\n\nThe total score $S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}}$ is the sum of these individual contributions:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = 0.60 + 0.15 + 0.24 + 0.05$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = 1.04$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value, $1.04$, currently has three significant figures ($1$, $0$, $4$). To represent this value with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be included in the decimal part.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ADCC}} = 1.040$$",
