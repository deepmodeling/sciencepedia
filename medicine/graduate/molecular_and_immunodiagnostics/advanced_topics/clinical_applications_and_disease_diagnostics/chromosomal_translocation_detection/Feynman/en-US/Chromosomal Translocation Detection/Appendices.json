This exercise puts you in the role of a clinical bioinformatician tasked with creating a robust filtering pipeline. By applying first principles of molecular biology—such as splicing fidelity, transcriptional orientation, and patterns of gene promiscuity—you will learn to design and evaluate a strategy to prioritize clinically relevant translocations from raw computational outputs .",

            "problem": "An advanced molecular and immunodiagnostics laboratory is evaluating chromosomal translocations by Whole-Transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). To prioritize genuine fusion transcripts and deprioritize artifacts, the team wishes to construct a filtering pipeline that uses exon boundary concordance, transcript strand orientation, and partner gene promiscuity. The pipeline must be justified from first principles: the Central Dogma of Molecular Biology (DNA $\\rightarrow$ RNA $\\rightarrow$ protein), the definition of transcription orientation on the reference genome (gene strand $\\sigma \\in \\{+,-\\}$), and the fact that most processed messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules are spliced at annotated exon boundaries.\n\nThe following well-tested facts serve as the base:\n- Genuine RNA fusion junctions typically connect the $3'$ end of an exon in the $5'$ partner gene to the $5'$ start of an exon in the $3'$ partner gene, reflecting splice-mediated processing. Thus, the absolute offset from the nearest annotated exon boundary, denoted $\\epsilon$ in base pairs, is small for true events, with $\\epsilon$ often $\\le$ a few base pairs due to alignment uncertainty.\n- Transcript strand orientation must be coherent with transcriptional direction: for coding chimeras, the $5'$ partner and the $3'$ partner generally share the same transcriptional orientation $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2$, so that a single contiguous complementary DNA (cDNA) can be produced in the $5' \\rightarrow 3'$ direction. Antisense fusions can occur but are rare and typically deprioritized unless independently supported.\n- Partner gene promiscuity within a sample (or cohort)—the number of distinct fusion partners observed per gene, denoted $d$—is a strong prior for false positives, because mapping artifacts, read-through, and polymerase errors disproportionately involve highly expressed or repetitive genes. However, certain immune and oncogenic loci are legitimately promiscuous (e.g., Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH), Lysine Methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A, formerly Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL))), and should be explicitly whitelisted based on established clinical validity.\n\nYou are provided $M=6$ candidate fusion junctions with the following attributes per junction: the $5'$ partner gene and the $3'$ partner gene with their genomic strands $\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2 \\in \\{+,-\\}$, the number of split reads $s$ supporting the breakpoint, the number of spanning reads $k$ bridging the fusion across paired-end libraries, the exon boundary offset $\\epsilon$ in base pairs at the junction on both sides (assume a single representative value), and the per-gene promiscuity count $d$ within the current sample (the number of distinct partners observed for that gene). All numbers are per sample.\n\n- Candidate $1$: Breakpoint Cluster Region (BCR, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ Abelson 1 (ABL1, $\\sigma_2=+$); $s=12$, $k=48$, $\\epsilon=1$; $d_{\\text{BCR}}=1$, $d_{\\text{ABL1}}=2$.\n- Candidate $2$: Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ MYC proto-oncogene (MYC, $\\sigma_2=+$); $s=9$, $k=30$, $\\epsilon=2$; $d_{\\text{IGH}}=7$, $d_{\\text{MYC}}=3$.\n- Candidate $3$: Mucin 16 (MUC16, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ Ribosomal Protein Lateral Stalk Subunit P0 (RPLP0, $\\sigma_2=+$); $s=3$, $k=4$, $\\epsilon=15$; $d_{\\text{MUC16}}=10$, $d_{\\text{RPLP0}}=5$.\n- Candidate $4$: Lysine Methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ AF4/FMR2 Family Member 1 (AFF1, $\\sigma_2=+$); $s=7$, $k=20$, $\\epsilon=0$; $d_{\\text{KMT2A}}=8$, $d_{\\text{AFF1}}=4$.\n- Candidate $5$: Transcription Factor X (TFX, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ Gene Y (GY, $\\sigma_2=-$); $s=8$, $k=12$, $\\epsilon=3$; $d_{\\text{TFX}}=2$, $d_{\\text{GY}}=1$.\n- Candidate $6$: Ribosomal Protein L23a (RPL23A, $\\sigma_1=+$) $\\rightarrow$ Ribosomal Protein Lateral Stalk Subunit P0 (RPLP0, $\\sigma_2=+$); $s=2$, $k=6$, $\\epsilon=12$; $d_{\\text{RPL23A}}=4$, $d_{\\text{RPLP0}}=5$.\n\nThe laboratory wishes to prioritize real events such as BCR $\\rightarrow$ ABL1, IGH $\\rightarrow$ MYC, and KMT2A $\\rightarrow$ AFF1, while deprioritizing likely artifacts (e.g., ribosomal gene fusions, highly expressed mucins with poor boundary concordance, and antisense chimeras).\n\nWhich of the following filtering pipelines most appropriately operationalizes the above first principles to maximize sensitivity to canonical translocations while improving precision? Each pipeline is defined by a sequence of three steps using the variables $s$, $k$, $\\epsilon$, $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, and $d$, with thresholds $\\tau$ for boundary concordance and $D$ for promiscuity.\n\nA. Step $1$: enforce same-strand orientation by requiring $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$. Step $2$: remove any junction where either partner has $d \\ge D$ with $D=3$ (no whitelist). Step $3$: accept boundary offsets up to $\\tau=10$ base pairs (i.e., require $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$), regardless of $s$ and $k$.\n\nB. Step $1$: require splice-consistent boundaries and minimal read support: $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$ with $\\tau=3$ and $s \\ge 5$, $k \\ge 10$. Step $2$: require same-strand orientation $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$ for coding fusions; flag opposite-strand events for separate review. Step $3$: penalize promiscuous partners by removing junctions where either gene has $d \\ge D$ with $D=5$, but apply an explicit whitelist for clinically validated promiscuous loci (e.g., IGH, KMT2A, BCR, T-cell receptor genes), allowing them to pass if Steps $1$ and $2$ are met.\n\nC. Step $1$: remove any junction where either partner has $d \\ge D$ with $D=3$ (no whitelist). Step $2$: require $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$ only if $s < 10$, otherwise skip orientation filtering. Step $3$: accept boundary offsets up to $\\tau=20$ base pairs (i.e., require $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$), irrespective of $k$.\n\nD. Step $1$: require exact exon boundary matches and high split-read support: $\\epsilon=0$ and $s \\ge 10$. Step $2$: require $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$. Step $3$: skip promiscuity filtering entirely to avoid discarding potential true positives.\n\nSelect the single best pipeline.",
            "solution": "The objective is to select the filtering pipeline that best operationalizes the stated first principles: exon boundary concordance, transcript strand orientation, and partner gene promiscuity (with whitelisting). The goal is to maximize sensitivity for known canonical translocations while improving precision by removing likely artifacts. We will evaluate each proposed pipeline by applying it to the $M=6$ candidate fusions.\n\nThe canonical translocations to be kept are Candidate $1$ (BCR-ABL1), Candidate $2$ (IGH-MYC), and Candidate $4$ (KMT2A-AFF1).\nThe likely artifacts to be removed are Candidate $3$ (MUC16-RPLP0; highly promiscuous, poor boundary concordance), Candidate $5$ (TFX-GY; antisense), and Candidate $6$ (RPL23A-RPLP0; ribosomal, poor boundary concordance).\n\n**Evaluation of Pipeline A**\nThis pipeline consists of three steps:\n$1$. Require same-strand orientation ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$).\n$2$. Remove any junction where either partner has promiscuity $d \\ge D$ with $D=3$. This step does not use a whitelist.\n$3$. Require exon boundary offset $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$ with $\\tau=10$ base pairs.\n\n- Candidate $1$ (BCR-ABL1): Passes. $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$; $d_{\\text{BCR}}=1 < 3$ and $d_{\\text{ABL1}}=2 < 3$; $\\epsilon=1 \\le 10$. **Kept**.\n- Candidate $2$ (IGH-MYC): Fails. Passes Step $1$ ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$). Fails Step $2$ because $d_{\\text{IGH}}=7 \\ge 3$, and there is no whitelist for IGH. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $3$ (MUC16-RPLP0): Fails. Passes Step $1$ ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$). Fails Step $2$ because $d_{\\text{MUC16}}=10 \\ge 3$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $4$ (KMT2A-AFF1): Fails. Passes Step $1$ ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$). Fails Step $2$ because $d_{\\text{KMT2A}}=8 \\ge 3$, and there is no whitelist for KMT2A. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $5$ (TFX-GY): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $6$ (RPL23A-RPLP0): Fails. Passes Step $1$ ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$). Fails Step $2$ because $d_{\\text{RPLP0}}=5 \\ge 3$. **Removed**.\n\nVerdict on A: **Incorrect**. This pipeline incorrectly removes two of the three canonical translocations (Candidates $2$ and $4$). Its failure to implement a whitelist for biologically promiscuous but valid genes like IGH and KMT2A directly contradicts a key principle outlined in the problem statement. This results in unacceptably low sensitivity.\n\n**Evaluation of Pipeline B**\nThis pipeline consists of three steps:\n$1$. Require splice-consistent boundaries and minimal read support: $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$ with $\\tau=3$, and split reads $s \\ge 5$, spanning reads $k \\ge 10$.\n$2$. Require same-strand orientation $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$.\n$3$. Penalize promiscuous partners by removing junctions where either gene has $d \\ge D$ with $D=5$, but apply an explicit whitelist for IGH, KMT2A, BCR.\n\n- Candidate $1$ (BCR-ABL1): Passes. Step $1$: $\\epsilon=1 \\le 3$, $s=12 \\ge 5$, $k=48 \\ge 10$. Step $2$: $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$. Step $3$: $d_{\\text{BCR}}=1 < 5$ and $d_{\\text{ABL1}}=2 < 5$. **Kept**.\n- Candidate $2$ (IGH-MYC): Passes. Step $1$: $\\epsilon=2 \\le 3$, $s=9 \\ge 5$, $k=30 \\ge 10$. Step $2$: $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$. Step $3$: $d_{\\text{IGH}}=7 \\ge 5$, but IGH is on the whitelist; $d_{\\text{MYC}}=3 < 5$. **Kept**.\n- Candidate $3$ (MUC16-RPLP0): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $\\epsilon=15 \\not\\le 3$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $4$ (KMT2A-AFF1): Passes. Step $1$: $\\epsilon=0 \\le 3$, $s=7 \\ge 5$, $k=20 \\ge 10$. Step $2$: $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$. Step $3$: $d_{\\text{KMT2A}}=8 \\ge 5$, but KMT2A is on the whitelist; $d_{\\text{AFF1}}=4 < 5$. **Kept**.\n- Candidate $5$ (TFX-GY): Fails. Passes Step $1$ ($\\epsilon=3 \\le 3$, $s=8 \\ge 5$, $k=12 \\ge 10$). Fails Step $2$ because $\\sigma_1 \\ne \\sigma_2$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $6$ (RPL23A-RPLP0): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $\\epsilon=12 \\not\\le 3$. **Removed**.\n\nVerdict on B: **Correct**. This pipeline successfully retains all three canonical translocations and removes all three likely artifacts. It correctly operationalizes all specified first principles: a stringent but realistic boundary concordance filter ($\\epsilon \\le 3$), minimum read support ($s, k$), a strict orientation check ($\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$), and a principled promiscuity filter ($d \\ge 5$) that crucially incorporates a whitelist. This achieves the stated goal of maximizing sensitivity while improving precision.\n\n**Evaluation of Pipeline C**\nThis pipeline consists of three steps:\n$1$. Remove any junction where either partner has $d \\ge D$ with $D=3$ (no whitelist).\n$2$. Require $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$ only if $s < 10$.\n$3$. Require $\\epsilon \\le \\tau$ with $\\tau=20$ base pairs.\n\n- Candidate $1$ (BCR-ABL1): Passes. Step $1$: $d$ values are $< 3$. Step $2$: $s=12 \\ge 10$, so orientation check is skipped. Step $3$: $\\epsilon=1 \\le 20$. **Kept**.\n- Candidate $2$ (IGH-MYC): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $d_{\\text{IGH}}=7 \\ge 3$ and there is no whitelist. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $4$ (KMT2A-AFF1): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $d_{\\text{KMT2A}}=8 \\ge 3$ and there is no whitelist. **Removed**.\n\nVerdict on C: **Incorrect**. Like pipeline A, this pipeline fails due to the lack of a whitelist, incorrectly removing canonical translocations (Candidates $2$ and $4$). Furthermore, its logic is scientifically questionable. Step $2$'s conditional orientation check is not based on first principles; a productive in-frame fusion requires same-strand orientation regardless of read support. Step $3$'s boundary offset threshold of $\\tau=20$ is excessively permissive and would reduce precision.\n\n**Evaluation of Pipeline D**\nThis pipeline consists of three steps:\n$1$. Require exact exon boundary matches $\\epsilon=0$ and high split-read support $s \\ge 10$.\n$2$. Require $\\sigma_1=\\sigma_2$.\n$3$. Skip promiscuity filtering entirely.\n\n- Candidate $1$ (BCR-ABL1): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $\\epsilon=1 \\ne 0$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $2$ (IGH-MYC): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because $\\epsilon=2 \\ne 0$. **Removed**.\n- Candidate $4$ (KMT2A-AFF1): Fails. Fails Step $1$ because while $\\epsilon=0$, the split-read support $s=7$ is less than the required $s \\ge 10$. **Removed**.\n\nVerdict on D: **Incorrect**. This pipeline is overly stringent, removing all three canonical translocations. The requirement for $\\epsilon = 0$ is too strict, as it does not account for minor alignment ambiguities mentioned in the problem description. The high threshold for split reads ($s \\ge 10$) also reduces sensitivity unnecessarily. Critically, by skipping promiscuity filtering entirely (Step $3$), this pipeline ignores a \"strong prior for false positives\" and would have low precision for artifacts that happen to satisfy the other criteria.",

The data provided, including gene structures, coding sequence coordinates, and exon boundaries, are internally consistent, with one minor exception. The KIN9 kinase domain is stated to be encoded by c.$810$–c.$1860$, which is a sequence of length $1860 - 810 + 1 = 1051$ nucleotides. This is not divisible by $3$, which contradicts the principle that protein-coding regions must have a length that is a multiple of $3$. However, all other numerical data, including all exon lengths and boundaries, are fully consistent. This minor inconsistency in the domain definition does not affect the central calculations regarding the fusion junction, which is the core of the problem. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution based on foundational principles.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The minor inconsistency is noted but does not preclude a rigorous solution to the primary questions asked. Proceeding to solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: (1) mapping the breakpoints to their respective exons, (2) determining if the fusion is in-frame or out-of-frame, and (3) predicting the biological consequences.\n\n1.  **Exon Mapping of Breakpoints**\n    -   **$FUS5$ Breakpoint**: The break occurs after coding nucleotide c.$245$ of $FUS5$. The coding exons for $FUS5$ are given as $E2$: c.$1$–c.$180$ and $E3$: c.$181$–c.$270$. Since the position $245$ falls within the range $[181, 270]$, the $FUS5$ breakpoint is located within exon $E3$.\n    -   **$KIN9$ Breakpoint**: The break occurs after coding nucleotide c.$1005$ of $KIN9$. The coding exons for $KIN9$ around this position are $E6$: c.$841$–c.$1005$ and $E7$: c.$1006$–c.$1125$. The break is exactly at the boundary between exon $E6$ and exon $E7$. The fusion transcript contains the $KIN9$ sequence starting from c.$1006$, which corresponds to the beginning of exon $E7$. Therefore, the breakpoint can be described as occurring at the end of exon $E6$.\n\n2.  **Reading Frame Analysis**\n    -   The reading frame of a fusion protein is determined by the number of nucleotides contributed by the $5'$ partner gene, in this case $FUS5$. The fusion protein will be translated in the correct reading frame of the $3'$ partner gene ($KIN9$) only if the number of nucleotides from the $5'$ partner is a multiple of $3$.\n    -   The $FUS5$ gene contributes nucleotides c.$1$ through c.$245$, for a total of $245$ nucleotides.\n    -   To check if this maintains the reading frame, we calculate the remainder of $245$ when divided by $3$:\n    $$245 \\pmod 3 = (243 + 2) \\pmod 3 = 2$$\n    -   A remainder of $0$ is required to maintain the reading frame. Since the remainder is $2$, the junction is **out-of-frame**. The first nucleotide from $KIN9$ (c.$1006$) will be read as the third base of a codon, causing a frameshift. The protein sequence translated from the $KIN9$ portion of the transcript will be completely different from the canonical KIN9 amino acid sequence.\n\n3.  **Prediction of Biological Consequences**\n    -   An out-of-frame fusion results in the translation of a nonsense amino acid sequence downstream of the fusion junction.\n    -   This aberrant translation will almost certainly encounter a premature termination codon (PTC) in the new reading frame. The probability of a random codon being a stop codon is approximately $3/64$, meaning a PTC is expected to occur within a short distance (on average, $\\approx 21$ codons) from the junction.\n    -   The resulting protein will be truncated. It will consist of the first $81$ amino acids of $FUS5$ plus a few gibberish amino acids before translation terminates. Crucially, a functional KIN9 kinase domain will not be produced. This leads to a loss of the kinase activity associated with the fusion product.\n    -   Furthermore, messenger RNA transcripts containing PTCs are typically recognized and degraded by the cellular surveillance mechanism known as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This would further reduce or eliminate the production of the truncated protein.\n    -   The question asks about the result of phospho-KIN9 IHC. This assay uses an antibody that recognizes a phosphorylated epitope in the KIN9 activation loop, which is a critical part of the kinase domain. Since no functional kinase domain is translated from the fusion transcript, there will be no KIN9 activation loop to be phosphorylated. Therefore, the phospho-KIN9 IHC is expected to be **negative**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n-   **Option A**: \"The FUS5 breakpoint lies in exon $E3$ and the KIN9 breakpoint lies at the end of exon $E6$; the fusion is out-of-frame at the junction, leading to a premature termination codon upstream of the KIN9 kinase domain, loss of kinase activity, likely nonsense-mediated decay, and negative phospho-KIN9 IHC.\"\n    -   Exon mapping: Correct ($FUS5$ in $E3$, $KIN9$ at end of $E6$).\n    -   Frame status: Correct (out-of-frame).\n    -   Consequence prediction: Correct. A PTC will occur, leading to loss of kinase activity, likely NMD, and negative phospho-KIN9 IHC. The phrasing \"upstream of the KIN9 kinase domain\" is slightly imprecise, as the junction at c.$1006$ is *within* the sequence that normally encodes the kinase domain (c.$810$–c.$1860$). However, the PTC effectively arises before any functional domain can be formed. Among the given choices, this small inaccuracy does not invalidate the overall correctness of the statement.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **Option B**: \"The FUS5 breakpoint lies in exon $E3$ and the KIN9 breakpoint lies at the end of exon $E6$; the fusion is in-frame, preserving the full KIN9 kinase domain downstream of the FUS5 coiled-coil, causing constitutive kinase activation and positive phospho-KIN9 IHC.\"\n    -   Frame status: Incorrect. The fusion is out-of-frame. All subsequent conclusions are therefore invalid.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option C**: \"The FUS5 breakpoint lies in exon $E2$ and the KIN9 breakpoint lies in exon $E7$; the fusion is in-frame and retains the entire kinase domain, predicting constitutive activation and positive phospho-KIN9 IHC.\"\n    -   Exon mapping: Incorrect. The FUS5 breakpoint is in $E3$, not $E2$.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **Option D**: \"The FUS5 breakpoint lies in exon $E3$ and the KIN9 breakpoint lies at the end of exon $E6$; the fusion is out-of-frame but translation reinitiates at a downstream AUG within KIN9 to produce a near-full-length kinase, predicting positive phospho-KIN9 IHC.\"\n    -   Frame status: Correct (out-of-frame).\n    -   Proposed mechanism: Translational reinitiation is a possible but inefficient and context-dependent mechanism in eukaryotes. It is not the primary or most predictable outcome of a frameshift. The most fundamental and common consequence is termination at a PTC and likely NMD, as described in Option A. This option is speculative and less probable than Option A.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a rigorous application of molecular biology principles, Option A provides the most accurate and comprehensive interpretation of the data.",

            "introduction": "The abundance of a translocation within a tumor sample, measured from DNA sequencing data as the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF), provides crucial information about its clonality and potential role as a cancer driver. However, the observed VAF is not a direct measure of the fraction of cancer cells carrying the mutation; it is a composite signal confounded by tumor purity and local copy number changes. This advanced practice challenges you to deconstruct this signal by applying the standard quantitative model used in cancer genomics, enabling a more accurate interpretation of a translocation's prevalence and significance .",

            "problem": "A clinical laboratory is validating a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) assay for detecting chromosomal translocations at deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) breakpoints. In a tumor sample with tumor purity $p$ (the fraction of nucleated cells that are neoplastic), the breakpoints are assayed by counting junction-supporting molecules ($n_{\\text{junction}}$; split reads or read pairs whose alignment spans the fusion junction) and reference molecules ($n_{\\text{reference}}$; reads or read pairs spanning the corresponding wild-type locus without the junction). Variant allele fraction (VAF) for a fusion breakpoint is operationally defined for this assay as the fraction of molecules among those mapping across the breakpoint locus that carry the junction. The laboratory also tracks the tumor’s locus-specific total copy number in tumor cells, $C_{\\text{tumor}}$, and the number of those copies that carry the junction, $c_{\\text{var}}$. Normal (non-neoplastic) cells are assumed diploid, with total copy number $C_{\\text{normal}}=2$ and $c_{\\text{var}}=0$. Sequencing reads are assumed to sample molecules at random without allelic bias.\n\nConsider a case with observed counts $n_{\\text{junction}} = 80$ and $n_{\\text{reference}} = 220$ at a single breakpoint, for a total of $n = 300$ molecules. Orthogonal profiling estimates tumor purity $p = 0.6$. Copy-number profiling at the breakpoint locus in tumor cells indicates $C_{\\text{tumor}} = 3$, and structural variant phasing indicates $c_{\\text{var}} = 1$ (that is, one of the three tumor copies carries the fusion junction, two copies are unfused).\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct? Select all that apply.\n\nA. For a fusion breakpoint in DNA sequencing, $VAF$ is given by $VAF = \\dfrac{n_{\\text{junction}}}{n_{\\text{junction}} + n_{\\text{reference}}}$; under the random sampling model with tumor purity $p$, tumor total copy number $C_{\\text{tumor}}$, and junction-bearing copies $c_{\\text{var}}$, the expected $VAF$ equals $\\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)\\cdot C_{\\text{normal}}}$.\n\nB.

Copy-number gain of the fused allele (increasing $c_{\\text{var}}$ while holding $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ fixed) inflates the expected $VAF$, whereas copy-number gain of the unfused allele (increasing $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ while holding $c_{\\text{var}}$ fixed) depresses the expected $VAF$, even if the fusion is clonal.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, clarity, and completeness.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Variables and Definitions:**\n    -   $p$: tumor purity, the fraction of neoplastic cells.\n    -   $n_{\\text{junction}}$: observed count of junction-supporting molecules.\n    -   $n_{\\text{reference}}$: observed count of reference (wild-type) molecules.\n    -   Variant allele fraction (VAF): Operationally defined as the fraction of molecules among those mapping across the breakpoint locus that carry the junction.\n    -   $C_{\\text{tumor}}$: locus-specific total copy number in tumor cells.\n    -   $c_{\\text{var}}$: number of tumor cell copies that carry the junction.\n    -   $C_{\\text{normal}}$: total copy number in normal (non-neoplastic) cells.\n    -   $c_{\\text{var}}$ in normal cells is $0$.\n-   **Constants and Conditions:**\n    -   $C_{\\text{normal}} = 2$.\n    -   Sequencing reads are assumed to sample molecules at random without allelic bias.\n-   **Specific Data for a Case:**\n    -   $n_{\\text{junction}} = 80$.\n    -   $n_{\\text{reference}} = 220$.\n    -   $p = 0.6$.\n    -   $C_{\\text{tumor}} = 3$.\n    -   $c_{\\text{var}} = 1$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem describes a standard and widely accepted model in computational cancer genomics for relating the observed variant allele fraction of a somatic mutation to tumor purity and copy number aberrations. The concepts of tumor purity, copy number, junction reads for structural variants, and binomial sampling of sequencing reads are all fundamental to the field of molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics. The model is scientifically sound and realistic.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** All terms are explicitly defined. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to evaluate each of the statements in the options. The task is to assess the correctness of statements based on the provided model and data, which is a well-defined objective.\n-   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated using precise, objective, and quantitative language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n-   **Conclusion:** The problem statement is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and free from any of the specified flaws.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\nThe problem requires evaluating several statements about a model for the Variant Allele Fraction (VAF) of a chromosomal translocation. First, we establish the theoretical model for the expected VAF, $E[VAF]$.\n\nThe VAF represents the fraction of DNA molecules at a specific locus that carry the variant (the fusion junction). The total pool of DNA molecules is a mixture from tumor cells (fraction $p$) and normal cells (fraction $1-p$). Assuming the number of reads is proportional to the number of DNA copies:\n-   The contribution of junction-bearing copies comes solely from tumor cells. The relative abundance is proportional to (fraction of tumor cells) $\\times$ (number of junction copies per tumor cell) = $p \\cdot c_{\\text{var}}$.\n-   The total number of copies at the locus comes from both cell types. The relative abundance is proportional to (fraction of tumor cells) $\\times$ (total copies per tumor cell) + (fraction of normal cells) $\\times$ (total copies per normal cell) = $p \\cdot C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p) \\cdot C_{\\text{normal}}$.\n\nThus, the expected VAF is the ratio of these quantities:\n$$E[VAF] = \\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}}$$\n\nWith this model, we can evaluate each option.\n\n**A. For a fusion breakpoint in DNA sequencing, $VAF$ is given by $VAF = \\dfrac{n_{\\text{junction}}}{n_{\\text{junction}} + n_{\\text{reference}}}$; under the random sampling model with tumor purity $p$, tumor total copy number $C_{\\text{tumor}}$, and junction-bearing copies $c_{\\text{var}}$, the expected $VAF$ equals $\\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)\\cdot C_{\\text{normal}}}$.**\n\nThe first part of the statement, $VAF = \\dfrac{n_{\\text{junction}}}{n_{\\text{junction}} + n_{\\text{reference}}}$, is the empirical VAF calculated from observed counts. The problem states that VAF is \"operationally defined for this assay as the fraction of molecules among those mapping across the breakpoint locus that carry the junction.\" This matches the formula.\nThe second part of the statement gives the formula for the expected VAF. As derived above, this formula correctly models the VAF based on the biological parameters.\nTherefore, the entire statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For a clonal heterozygous breakpoint present on exactly one of two tumor alleles in a diploid tumor ($C_{\\text{tumor}} = 2$, $c_{\\text{var}} = 1$), the expected $VAF$ simplifies to $VAF = \\dfrac{p}{2}$.**\n\nThis statement describes a specific scenario. We use the general formula for $E[VAF]$ with the given parameters: $C_{\\text{tumor}} = 2$, $c_{\\text{var}} = 1$, and the standard $C_{\\text{normal}} = 2$.\n$$E[VAF] = \\dfrac{p \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 2 + (1-p) \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{p}{2p + 2 - 2p} = \\dfrac{p}{2}$$\nThe derivation is correct. Although the statement uses \"VAF\" instead of \"$E[VAF]$\", the context \"the expected VAF simplifies to\" makes the meaning clear.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. With $p = 0.6$, $C_{\\text{tumor}} = 3$, $c_{\\text{var}} = 1$, the observed $VAF = \\dfrac{80}{300}$ is statistically inconsistent at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ with the expected model under binomial sampling.**\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed VAF and the expected VAF from the given data.\nObserved VAF: $VAF_{obs} = \\dfrac{n_{\\text{junction}}}{n_{\\text{junction}} + n_{\\text{reference}}} = \\dfrac{80}{80 + 220} = \\dfrac{80}{300} = \\dfrac{4}{15} \\approx 0.2667$.\nExpected VAF: $E[VAF] = P_{exp} = \\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}} = \\dfrac{0.6 \\cdot 1}{0.6 \\cdot 3 + (1-0.6) \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{0.6}{1.8 + 0.4 \\cdot 2} = \\dfrac{0.6}{1.8 + 0.8} = \\dfrac{0.6}{2.6} = \\dfrac{6}{26} = \\dfrac{3}{13} \\approx 0.2308$.\n\nWe test the null hypothesis $H_0: P = P_{exp} = 3/13$, where $P$ is the true VAF. The number of junction reads $n_{\\text{junction}}$ is modeled as a binomial random variable $X \\sim B(n, P)$ with $n = 300$ trials and observed successes $k = 80$.\nSince $n$ is large, we can use the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. The test statistic $Z$ is:\n$$Z = \\dfrac{k - nP_{exp}}{\\sqrt{nP_{exp}(1-P_{exp})}}$$\nExpected number of junction reads: $n P_{exp} = 300 \\cdot (3/13) \\approx 69.23$.\n$$Z = \\dfrac{80 - 69.23}{\\sqrt{300 \\cdot (3/13) \\cdot (10/13)}} = \\dfrac{10.77}{\\sqrt{69.23 \\cdot (10/13)}} = \\dfrac{10.77}{\\sqrt{53.25}} \\approx \\dfrac{10.77}{7.297} \\approx 1.476$$\nFor a two-tailed test at significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$, the critical values are $Z_{crit} = \\pm 1.96$. Since $|Z| \\approx 1.476 < 1.96$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The observed VAF is statistically *consistent* with the expected model. The statement claims it is inconsistent.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Holding $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ and $c_{\\text{var}}$ fixed, the expected $VAF$ increases monotonically as tumor purity $p$ increases.**\n\nWe analyze the behavior of $E[VAF]$ as a function of $p$, for $p \\in [0, 1]$.\nLet $V(p) = \\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}} = \\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p(C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}}) + C_{\\text{normal}}}$.\nTo determine monotonicity, we find the derivative of $V(p)$ with respect to $p$. Using the quotient rule $\\left(\\frac{u}{v}\\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$:\n$$V'(p) = \\dfrac{c_{\\text{var}} \\left[ p(C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}}) + C_{\\text{normal}} \\right] - p \\, c_{\\text{var}} \\left[ C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}} \\right]}{\\left(p(C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}}) + C_{\\text{normal}}\\right)^2}$$\n$$V'(p) = \\dfrac{p c_{\\text{var}}(C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}}) + c_{\\text{var}}C_{\\text{normal}} - p c_{\\text{var}}(C_{\\text{tumor}} - C_{\\text{normal}})}{\\left( \\text{denominator} \\right)^2}$$\n$$V'(p) = \\dfrac{c_{\\text{var}} C_{\\text{normal}}}{\\left(p C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}\\right)^2}$$\nThe denominator is the square of the average copy number, which is always positive. The numerator contains $c_{\\text{var}}$ (number of junction copies, $c_{\\text{var}} \\ge 1$ for a detected fusion) and $C_{\\text{normal}}=2$. Both are positive. Thus, $V'(p) > 0$ for all $p$ in its domain. This proves that the expected VAF is a strictly monotonically increasing function of tumor purity $p$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. Copy-number gain of the fused allele (increasing $c_{\\text{var}}$ while holding $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ fixed) inflates the expected $VAF$, whereas copy-number gain of the unfused allele (increasing $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ while holding $c_{\\text{var}}$ fixed) depresses the expected $VAF$, even if the fusion is clonal.**\n\nWe analyze the partial derivatives of the expected VAF function $V(C_{\\text{tumor}}, c_{\\text{var}}) = \\dfrac{p \\, c_{\\text{var}}}{p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}}$.\n1.  Effect of increasing $c_{\\text{var}}$: The numerator $p \\, c_{\\text{var}}$ is directly proportional to $c_{\\text{var}}$, while the denominator is held constant. Therefore, as $c_{\\text{var}}$ increases, the value of the fraction increases (\"inflates\"). This is true as long as $p>0$.\n2.  Effect of increasing $C_{\\text{tumor}}$: The numerator $p \\, c_{\\text{var}}$ is held constant. The denominator $p \\, C_{\\text{tumor}} + (1-p)C_{\\text{normal}}$ increases linearly with $C_{\\text{tumor}}$ (since $p > 0$). When the numerator of a positive fraction is constant and the denominator increases, the fraction's value decreases (\"depresses\"). This corresponds to adding more unfused (wild-type) copies in the tumor, which dilutes the variant signal.\n\nBoth claims in the statement are correct descriptions of the model's behavior. The clonality reference simply confirms the model's applicability.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nFinal tally of correct options: A, B, D, E.",
