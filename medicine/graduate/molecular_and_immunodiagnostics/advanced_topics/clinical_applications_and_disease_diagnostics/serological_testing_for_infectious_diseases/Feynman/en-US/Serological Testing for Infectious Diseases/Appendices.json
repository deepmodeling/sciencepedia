            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit data provided in the problem statement are:\n- The pre-test probability of disease: $\\Pr(D) = 0.08$\n- The probability of a positive test among truly diseased individuals (clinical sensitivity): $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.92$\n- The probability of a positive test among truly non-diseased individuals (false-positive rate): $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.03$\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed for validity based on the established criteria.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in the principles of probability theory and their standard application to the evaluation of diagnostic tests in epidemiology and immunodiagnostics. The concepts of prevalence (pre-test probability), sensitivity, and false-positive rate are fundamental to this field. The numerical values provided are realistic for an ELISA assay.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information to calculate the desired quantity, the post-test probability of disease given a positive test, $\\Pr(D \\mid T^{+})$. The question is unambiguous and admits a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative language, free from subjective or biased claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to find the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, denoted as $\\Pr(D \\mid T^{+})$. This quantity is also known as the positive predictive value (PPV). The derivation will proceed from Bayes' theorem, which is the fundamental principle for updating probability estimates based on new evidence.\n\nAccording to the definition of conditional probability, Bayes' theorem can be stated as:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\Pr(D \\cap T^{+})}{\\Pr(T^{+})} $$\nThe joint probability in the numerator, $\\Pr(D \\cap T^{+})$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability as $\\Pr(D \\cap T^{+}) = \\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) \\Pr(D)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T^{+})} $$\nThe denominator, $\\Pr(T^{+})$, represents the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated using the law of total probability, which involves marginalizing over the disease status (present, $D$, or absent, $\\neg D$):\n$$ \\Pr(T^{+}) = \\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D) $$\nThe term $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D)$ is the clinical sensitivity of the assay. The term $\\Pr(D)$ is the pre-test probability, or prevalence. The term $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)$ is the false-positive rate. The term $\\Pr(\\neg D)$ is the probability of a subject not having the disease, which is the complement of the prevalence: $\\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D)$.\n\nCombining these expressions yields the full form of Bayes' theorem for this problem:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) \\Pr(D)}{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D)\\Pr(D) + \\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)\\Pr(\\neg D)} $$\nThis formulation connects the post-test probability to the given quantities.\n\nThe problem also mentions the concepts of specificity and the positive likelihood ratio.\n- **Specificity** is the probability of a negative test given the absence of disease, $\\Pr(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D)$. It is related to the false-positive rate by $\\Pr(T^{-} \\mid \\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)$.\n- The **Positive Likelihood Ratio ($LR^{+}$)** is the ratio of the probability of a positive test in a diseased individual to the probability of a positive test in a non-diseased individual:\n$$ LR^{+} = \\frac{\\text{sensitivity}}{\\text{false-positive rate}} = \\frac{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D)}{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)} $$\nThis ratio quantifies how much a positive test result increases the odds of disease.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into the derived formula for $\\Pr(D \\mid T^{+})$.\nGiven:\n- $\\Pr(D) = 0.08$\n- $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D) = 0.92$\n- $\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D) = 0.03$\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of not having the disease:\n$$ \\Pr(\\neg D) = 1 - \\Pr(D) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92 $$\nNext, we substitute these values into the Bayesian formula:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{(0.92)(0.08)}{(0.92)(0.08) + (0.03)(0.92)} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring out the common term $0.92$ from the denominator:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{(0.92)(0.08)}{0.92 \\times (0.08 + 0.03)} $$\nCanceling the common factor of $0.92$ from the numerator and denominator yields a simplified expression:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{0.08}{0.08 + 0.03} = \\frac{0.08}{0.11} $$\nTo express this as a simplified fraction, we write the decimal values as a fraction and simplify:\n$$ \\frac{0.08}{0.11} = \\frac{8/100}{11/100} = \\frac{8}{11} $$\nThe integers $8$ and $11$ are coprime, so the fraction is in its simplest form.\n\nThis result can also be understood through the odds-likelihood ratio formulation. The pre-test odds of disease are:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D) = \\frac{\\Pr(D)}{1 - \\Pr(D)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92} = \\frac{8}{92} = \\frac{2}{23} $$\nThe positive likelihood ratio is:\n$$ LR^{+} = \\frac{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid D)}{\\Pr(T^{+} \\mid \\neg D)} = \\frac{0.92}{0.03} = \\frac{92}{3} $$\nThe post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\text{Odds}(D) \\times LR^{+} = \\left(\\frac{2}{23}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{92}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\times (4 \\times 23)}{23 \\times 3} = \\frac{8}{3} $$\nFinally, convert the post-test odds back to a probability:\n$$ \\Pr(D \\mid T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(D \\mid T^{+})}{1 + \\text{Odds}(D \\mid T^{+})} = \\frac{8/3}{1 + 8/3} = \\frac{8/3}{11/3} = \\frac{8}{11} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the correctness of the derivation. The post-test probability of disease, given a positive test, is $\\frac{8}{11}$.",

The prevalence is given as $P(D) = p = 0.005$, so $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.005 = 0.995$.\n\nLet $E^+$ be the event of a reactive (positive) ELISA test and $I^+$ be the event of a positive immunoblot (IB) test.
