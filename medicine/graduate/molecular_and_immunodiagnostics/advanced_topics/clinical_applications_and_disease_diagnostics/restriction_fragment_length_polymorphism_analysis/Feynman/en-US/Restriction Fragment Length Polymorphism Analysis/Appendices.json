            "problem": "A genomic locus of length $10$ kilobases (kb) is being genotyped by Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using a single restriction endonuclease that cleaves double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at sequence-specific sites. The positions of restriction sites along the locus (measured from the $5'$ end) are at $0.7$ kb, $2.5$ kb, $4.9$ kb, $6.3$ kb, $8.4$ kb, and $9.6$ kb. A single-nucleotide variant abolishes the restriction site at $4.9$ kb in the variant allele, leaving all other sites unchanged. Detection is performed by Southern blot hybridization: a labeled DNA probe of length $0.8$ kb is designed to hybridize uniquely to the region spanning $5.0$ kb to $5.8$ kb within the locus. Assume complete digestion, perfectly specific probe hybridization to its complementary sequence, and that only fragments containing the entire probe sequence will be detected on the blot.\n\nUsing only fundamental principles that restriction endonucleases generate fragments whose lengths equal distances between adjacent cut sites and that Southern blot probes hybridize to complementary sequences present within fragments, first determine the sizes (in kb) of the restriction fragments that would be detected by the probe for the wild-type allele (with the site at $4.9$ kb present) and for the variant allele (with the site at $4.9$ kb absent). Then, predict the qualitative banding pattern for homozygous wild-type, homozygous variant, and heterozygous individuals, considering the presence or absence of the relevant bands on the blot.\n\nFinally, compute the numerical difference in kilobases between the sizes of the probe-hybridizing fragments in the wild-type versus variant alleles. Express your final numerical answer in kilobases (kb) and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained and consistent set of data and conditions for analyzing a standard Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) scenario. All necessary information is present to determine a unique and meaningful solution based on established principles of molecular biology. We may therefore proceed with a formal analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle of this analysis is that a restriction endonuclease cleaves a DNA molecule at specific recognition sites, generating a set of non-overlapping fragments. The length of each fragment is determined by the distance between two adjacent cleavage sites, or between a cleavage site and an end of the DNA locus. In Southern blot analysis, a labeled probe hybridizes to its complementary sequence on one of these fragments, thereby allowing for its detection.\n\nLet the genomic locus be represented by a coordinate system from $0$ to $10$ kilobases (kb).\n\n**1. Analysis of the Wild-Type (WT) Allele**\n\nFor the wild-type allele, the restriction sites are located at positions $x_i$ (in kb) along the locus: $x_1 = 0.7$, $x_2 = 2.5$, $x_3 = 4.9$, $x_4 = 6.3$, $x_5 = 8.4$, and $x_6 = 9.6$. These sites, along with the boundaries of the locus at $0$ kb and $10$ kb, define the endpoints of the restriction fragments.\n\nThe complete set of cut points for the wild-type allele is $\\{0, 0.7, 2.5, 4.9, 6.3, 8.4, 9.6, 10\\}$.\nThe lengths of the fragments generated are the differences between consecutive cut points:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Fragment 1: $0.7 - 0 = 0.7$ kb (spanning $[0, 0.7]$)\n    \\item Fragment 2: $2.5 - 0.7 = 1.8$ kb (spanning $[0.7, 2.5]$)\n    \\item Fragment 3: $4.9 - 2.5 = 2.4$ kb (spanning $[2.5, 4.9]$)\n    \\item Fragment 4: $6.3 - 4.9 = 1.4$ kb (spanning $[4.9, 6.3]$)\n    \\item Fragment 5: $8.4 - 6.3 = 2.1$ kb (spanning $[6.3, 8.4]$)\n    \\item Fragment 6: $9.6 - 8.4 = 1.2$ kb (spanning $[8.4, 9.6]$)\n    \\item Fragment 7: $10.0 - 9.6 = 0.4$ kb (spanning $[9.6, 10.0]$)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe DNA probe hybridizes to the region spanning from $5.0$ kb to $5.8$ kb. We must identify which of the fragments above contains this entire interval, i.e., $[5.0, 5.8]$.\nUpon inspection, the interval $[5.0, 5.8]$ is fully contained within the coordinate range $[4.9, 6.3]$. This range corresponds to Fragment 4.\nTherefore, for the wild-type allele, the probe will detect a fragment of size $S_{WT} = 1.4$ kb.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Variant (V) Allele**\n\nIn the variant allele, the single-nucleotide polymorphism abolishes the restriction site at $4.9$ kb. All other sites remain.\nThe new set of restriction sites is: $x_1 = 0.7$, $x_2 = 2.5$, $x_4 = 6.3$, $x_5 = 8.4$, and $x_6 = 9.6$.\nThe complete set of cut points for the variant allele is $\\{0, 0.7, 2.5, 6.3, 8.4, 9.6, 10\\}$.\n\nThe loss of the cut site at $4.9$ kb means that the two fragments previously flanking this site (Fragment 3 and Fragment 4 from the wild-type digest) are now part of a single, larger fragment. This new fragment is bounded by the sites at $2.5$ kb and $6.3$ kb.\nThe set of fragments for the variant allele is:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Fragment 1: $0.7 - 0 = 0.7$ kb (spanning $[0, 0.7]$)\n    \\item Fragment 2: $2.5 - 0.7 = 1.8$ kb (spanning $[0.7, 2.5]$)\n    \\item Fragment 3 (new): $6.3 - 2.5 = 3.8$ kb (spanning $[2.5, 6.3]$)\n    \\item Fragment 4 (new): $8.4 - 6.3 = 2.1$ kb (spanning $[6.3, 8.4]$)\n    \\item Fragment 5 (new): $9.6 - 8.4 = 1.2$ kb (spanning $[8.4, 9.6]$)\n    \\item Fragment 6 (new): $10.0 - 9.6 = 0.4$ kb (spanning $[9.6, 10.0]$)\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe probe hybridizes to the region $[5.0, 5.8]$. This interval is fully contained within the new Fragment 3, which spans the coordinate range $[2.5, 6.3]$.\nTherefore, for the variant allele, the probe will detect a fragment of size $S_V = 3.8$ kb.\n\n**3. Prediction of Banding Patterns**\n\nThe Southern blot will separate the detected fragments by size. Smaller fragments migrate further down the gel than larger fragments.\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Homozygous Wild-Type (WT/WT):** This individual possesses only the wild-type allele. The analysis will show a single band corresponding to the detected fragment size of $1.4$ kb.\n    \\item **Homozygous Variant (V/V):** This individual possesses only the variant allele. The analysis will show a single band corresponding to the detected fragment size of $3.8$ kb.\n    \\item **Heterozygous (WT/V):** This individual possesses one of each allele. The restriction digest will produce fragments from both alleles simultaneously. The probe will hybridize to the $1.4$ kb fragment from the WT allele and the $3.8$ kb fragment from the V allele. Consequently, the Southern blot will display two distinct bands: one at $1.4$ kb and another at $3.8$ kb.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n**4. Calculation of the Size Difference**\n\nThe final task is to compute the numerical difference, $\\Delta S$, between the sizes of the probe-hybridizing fragments from the variant and wild-type alleles.\nThe size of the fragment from the variant allele is $S_V = 3.8$ kb.\nThe size of the fragment from the wild-type allele is $S_{WT} = 1.4$ kb.\n\nThe difference is:\n$$ \\Delta S = S_V - S_{WT} = 3.8~\\text{kb} - 1.4~\\text{kb} = 2.4~\\text{kb} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $2.4$ is an exact result based on the provided data. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $2.400$.",

Use conservation of mass and the fact that band intensity on AGE is approximately proportional to the DNA mass in that band to reason about which fragment sizes and relative intensities must appear when $p  1$. Then, design a rigorous control digest that simultaneously confirms that the RE is catalytically active and that the reaction conditions are sufficient to achieve completion, without assuming any particular manufacturer’s shortcut protocol.\n\nWhich option best describes both the expected band pattern under incomplete digestion and an appropriate, mechanistically justified control digest?\n\nA. Incomplete digestion yields a mixture containing the undigested amplicon at $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, single-cut partial fragments at $0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from a cut at $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), and at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from a cut at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), plus the complete-digest fragments at $0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ arising from molecules cut at both sites. The relative band intensities scale with the probabilities $(1-p)^{2}$, $2p(1-p)$, and $p^{2}$, weighted by fragment length. A rigorous control is to digest, in parallel, a validated control DNA that contains exactly $1$ site for the same RE (yielding a predictable two-band pattern) to confirm enzyme activity, and to run a time-course or enzyme-excess titration on the sample to demonstrate convergence to the complete-digest pattern with disappearance of the $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, and $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ bands.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data are self-consistent and realistic for a standard molecular biology experiment.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis: first, to model the fragment pattern resulting from incomplete enzymatic digestion of a DNA amplicon, and second, to design a rigorous set of controls to validate the digestion reaction.\n\n### Part 1: Modeling Incomplete Digestion\n\n**Givens:**\n- A linear, double-stranded DNA amplicon of length $L = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$.\n- Two recognition sites for a single Restriction Endonuclease (RE) at positions $x_1 = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $x_2 = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ from one end (defined as the $5^{\\prime}$ end).\n- Cleavage at each site is an independent event with probability $p \\in (0,1)$.\n- Incomplete digestion corresponds to $p  1$.

There are $2$ sites, so there are $2^2 = 4$ possible outcomes for any given molecule.\n\n1.  **No cuts:** Neither site $x_1$ nor site $x_2$ is cleaved.\n    -   Probability: $P(\\text{no cut}) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^2$.\n    -   Resulting fragment: The original, undigested amplicon.\n    -   Fragment size: $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$.\n\n2.  **One cut (partial digestion):** Exactly one of the two sites is cleaved.\n    -   **Cut at $x_1$ only:** Site $x_1$ is cut, but site $x_2$ is not.\n        -   Probability: $P(\\text{cut at } x_1, \\text{no cut at } x_2) = p(1-p)$.\n        -   Resulting fragments: The molecule is cleaved at $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$. This produces two fragments.\n        -   Fragment sizes: $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $(1.2 - 0.3)\\,\\mathrm{kbp} = 0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$.\n    -   **Cut at $x_2$ only:** Site $x_2$ is cut, but site $x_1$ is not.\n        -   Probability: $P(\\text{no cut at } x_1, \\text{cut at } x_2) = (1-p)p$.\n        -   Resulting fragments: The molecule is cleaved at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$. This produces two fragments.\n        -   Fragment sizes: $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $(1.2 - 0.8)\\,\\mathrm{kbp} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$.\n\n3.  **Two cuts (complete digestion):** Both sites $x_1$ and $x_2$ are cleaved.\n    -   Probability: $P(\\text{cut at } x_1, \\text{cut at } x_2) = p \\times p = p^2$.\n    -   Resulting fragments: The molecule is cleaved at both $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$. This produces three fragments.\n    -   Fragment sizes: $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from $0$ to $0.3$), $(0.8 - 0.3)\\,\\mathrm{kbp} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from $0.3$ to $0.8$), and $(1.2 - 0.8)\\,\\mathrm{kbp} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from $0.8$ to $1.2$).\n\n**Expected Band Pattern on AGE:**\nThe gel will resolve all unique fragment sizes produced across the entire population of molecules. The list of unique fragment sizes is the union of the sets from all outcomes:\n- From no cut: $\\{1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}\\}$\n- From cut at $x_1$ only: $\\{0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}, 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}\\}$\n- From cut at $x_2$ only: $\\{0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}, 0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}\\}$\n- From two cuts: $\\{0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}, 0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}, 0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}\\}$\n\nThe combined set of bands expected on the gel is:\n$$ \\{1.2, 0.9, 0.8, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3\\}\\,\\mathrm{kbp} $$\nThis includes the undigested amplicon ($1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), partial digest products ($0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), and final digest products ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$). Note that the $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ fragments are produced in both partial and complete digestion events, so their total mass will be the sum from both pathways.\n\n### Part 2: Design of a Rigorous Control Digest\n\nThe objective is to design controls that **simultaneously** confirm two distinct points:\n1.  **Enzyme Activity:** The aliquot of Restriction Endonuclease being used is catalytically active.\n2.  **Reaction Completion:** The chosen reaction conditions (buffer, temperature, cofactors, time, enzyme concentration) are sufficient to drive the digestion of the specific PCR amplicon sample to completion. This is critical as the sample itself could contain inhibitors (e.g., carryover from PCR).\n\nA rigorous design involves running parallel reactions:\n-   **Control for Enzyme Activity (Positive Control):** A separate reaction should be set up using the same enzyme aliquot, buffer, and incubation conditions, but with a different DNA substrate. This substrate must be a well-characterized control DNA (e.g., bacteriophage lambda DNA, or a commercial plasmid) for which the digestion pattern with the specific RE is known and validated. For maximal clarity, a control DNA with a single recognition site is excellent, as it should yield a simple, unambiguous two-band pattern upon complete digestion. If this control digest works as expected, it proves the enzyme is active.\n-   **Control for Reaction Completion:** To confirm the reaction on the *experimental sample* can go to completion, one must demonstrate that the reaction has reached a stable endpoint where partial digest products are no longer present. This is best achieved by a titration experiment performed on the sample DNA:\n    -   **Time-course experiment:** Aliquots of the digestion reaction are stopped at increasing time points (e.g., $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$, $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$, $1\\,\\mathrm{h}$, $2\\,\\mathrm{h}$, overnight). On the resulting gel, one should observe the disappearance of the higher molecular weight bands corresponding to undigested ($1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$) and partially digested ($0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$) species, with a corresponding increase in the intensity of the final digest product bands ($0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$). The reaction is considered complete when the band pattern ceases to change at longer time points.\n    -   **Enzyme titration experiment:** A series of parallel reactions are set up with a fixed amount of sample DNA and incubated for a fixed time, but with increasing units of RE. If the reaction is incomplete due to insufficient enzyme, increasing the enzyme concentration will shift the pattern towards completion. The reaction is considered complete under conditions where further addition of enzyme does not change the final banding pattern.\n\nCombining these controls provides a robust validation of the entire RFLP procedure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** \"Incomplete digestion yields a mixture containing the undigested amplicon at $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, single-cut partial fragments at $0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from a cut at $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), and at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ and $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ (from a cut at $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$), plus the complete-digest fragments at $0.5\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.4\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, and $0.3\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$... The relative band intensities scale with the probabilities $(1-p)^{2}$, $2p(1-p)$, and $p^{2}$, weighted by fragment length. A rigorous control is to digest, in parallel, a validated control DNA that contains exactly $1$ site... to confirm enzyme activity, and to run a time-course or enzyme-excess titration on the sample to demonstrate convergence to the complete-digest pattern with disappearance of the $1.2\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, $0.9\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$, and $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ bands.\"\n- **Analysis of pattern:** This description of fragments perfectly matches the derivation above. It correctly identifies the undigested, partial, and complete digest products. The statement about intensities, while a high-level summary, correctly links the probabilities of event classes (0, 1, or 2 cuts) to the mass of resulting fragments.\n- **Analysis of control:** The proposed control strategy is comprehensive and rigorous. It correctly uses a positive control DNA to check enzyme viability and a titration on the sample itself to confirm the potential for reaction completion, thereby ruling out sample-specific inhibitors or suboptimal conditions. The expected outcome (disappearance of partial digest bands) is correctly stated.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B.** \"Incomplete digestion yields only the three expected complete-digest fragments... but each at lower intensity...\"\n- **Analysis of pattern:** This is fundamentally incorrect. Incomplete digestion means by definition that a fraction of the initial molecules are not fully digested. These uncut and partially cut molecules must appear on the gel as distinct, higher molecular weight bands. The pattern cannot consist *only* of the final products.\n- **Analysis of control:** \"run an undigested lane loaded with half the DNA mass so that band intensities match by visual inspection.\" This control is nonsensical. It does not test for enzyme activity or reaction completion.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** \"Incomplete digestion primarily produces a smear due to star activity...\"\n- **Analysis of pattern:** This conflates two different phenomena. Incomplete digestion is the failure to cut at all specific sites, leading to a discrete set of larger bands. Star activity is non-specific cutting at sites resembling the true recognition sequence, which often occurs under non-optimal buffer conditions (e.g., high glycerol, incorrect $\\mathrm{pH}$) and typically results in a smear. The problem is explicitly about incomplete digestion of specific sites.\n- **Analysis of control:** \"add Ethylenediaminetetraacetic Acid (EDTA) to the reaction and verify that the smear disappears...\" Restriction enzymes require $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ as a cofactor. EDTA is a chelator that sequesters $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, thereby *inhibiting* the enzyme. This control would only prove the digestion is $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-dependent; it does not confirm activity or completion.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** \"Incomplete digestion yields a single additional band at $0.6\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ because the enzyme preferentially introduces single-strand nicks...\"\n- **Analysis of pattern:** This is physically and mathematically baseless. A single-strand nick in a double-stranded DNA molecule does not cleave it into two pieces and does not significantly alter its migration in standard non-denaturing AGE. The bands that appear are determined by double-strand breaks at the defined restriction sites, which as calculated above are $1.2$, $0.9$, and $0.8\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$ intermediates, not $0.6\\,\\mathrm{kbp}$.\n- **Analysis of control:** \"heat-inactivate the RE and rerun the same sample...\" This is a negative control. It can show that a band is enzyme-dependent, but it fails to meet the specified goals of confirming the enzyme is *active* (i.e., cuts correctly) and that the reaction conditions are sufficient for *completion*.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the rigorous derivation from first principles, Option A provides a completely accurate description of the expected banding pattern and proposes a control strategy that is standard and correct for validating the experimental procedure.",

This implies that the rate of digestion of lambda DNA by an amount of enzyme $E$ (in Units) is $E \\, \\mu g/h$. For human genomic DNA, this rate is reduced by a factor $r$. Thus, the initial digestion rate is $r \\cdot E \\, \\mu g/h$.\n\nThe enzyme undergoes first-order thermal inactivation, meaning the number of active enzyme units, $E(t)$, decreases exponentially from its initial value, $E_0$, according to the relation:\n$$ E(t) = E_0 \\exp(-kt) $$\nwhere $k$ is the first-order rate constant for inactivation. The rate constant $k$ is related to the enzyme's half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by the formula:\n$$ E(t_{1/2}) = \\frac{E_0}{2} = E_0 \\exp(-kt_{1/2}) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -kt_{1/2} $$\n$$ k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}} $$\nThe instantaneous rate of digestion of human genomic DNA at time $t$ is given by $v(t) = r \\cdot E(t)$. To find the total mass of DNA, $m_{digested}$, digested over the incubation period $t_{inc}$, we must integrate this rate from $t=0$ to $t=t_{inc}$:\n$$ m_{digested} = \\int_{0}^{t_{inc}} v(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{t_{inc}} r \\cdot E_0 \\exp(-kt) \\, dt $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ m_{digested} = r E_0 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-kt) \\right]_{0}^{t_{inc}} $$\n$$ m_{digested} = r E_0 \\left( -\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(-kt_{inc}) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{k} \\exp(0)\\right) \\right) $$\n$$ m_{digested} = \\frac{r E_0}{k} (1 - \\exp(-kt_{inc})) $$\nTo achieve complete digestion of a mass $m_{DNA}$, we set $m_{digested} = m_{DNA}$. The theoretical minimum initial enzyme amount, $E_{0,min}$, required is found by solving for $E_0$:\n$$ E_{0,min} = \\frac{m_{DNA} \\cdot k}{r (1 - \\exp(-kt_{inc}))} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$:\n$$ E_{0,min} = \\frac{m_{DNA} \\left(\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)}{r \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2) \\cdot t_{inc}}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)} = \\frac{m_{DNA} \\ln(2)}{r \\cdot t_{1/2} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{inc} \\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)} $$\nThe problem mandates a safety factor $S$, so the finally required units, $E_{req}$, are:\n$$ E_{req} = S \\cdot E_{0,min} = \\frac{S \\cdot m_{DNA} \\ln(2)}{r \\cdot t_{1/2} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{inc} \\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}\\right)\\right)} $$\nThis is the general expression for the required enzyme units.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $E_{req}$**\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- Total DNA mass, $m_{DNA} = 12.0 \\, \\mu g$\n- Safety factor, $S = 7.00$\n- Relative rate, $r = 0.65$\n- Half-life, $t_{1/2} = 1.20 \\, h$\n- Incubation time, $t_{inc} = 2.50 \\, h$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless exponent:\n$$ \\frac{t_{inc}}{t_{1/2}} = \\frac{2.50}{1.20} = \\frac{25}{12} \\approx 2.0833 $$\nNow, substitute the values into the full expression for $E_{req}$:\n$$ E_{req} = \\frac{7.00 \\cdot 12.0 \\cdot \\ln(2)}{0.65 \\cdot 1.20 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2.50 \\cdot \\ln(2)}{1.20}\\right)\\right)} $$\n$$ E_{req} = \\frac{84.0 \\cdot \\ln(2)}{0.78 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2.5}{1.2}\\ln(2)\\right)\\right)} $$\nUsing $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$:\n$$ E_{req} \\approx \\frac{84.0 \\cdot 0.693147}{0.78 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-2.0833 \\cdot 0.693147\\right)\\right)} $$\n$$ E_{req} \\approx \\frac{58.224}{0.78 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-1.44406\\right)\\right)} $$\n$$ E_{req} \\approx \\frac{58.224}{0.78 \\left(1 - 0.23596\\right)} $$\n$$ E_{req} \\approx \\frac{58.224}{0.78 \\cdot 0.76404} $$\n$$ E_{req} \\approx \\frac{58.224}{0.59595} \\approx 97.699 \\, U $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required number of enzyme units is $97.7 \\, U$.\n\n**Part 3: Verification of Reaction Constraints**\n\nWe must now verify if it is possible to deliver $E_{req} = 97.7 \\, U$ into a final reaction volume of $V_{total} = 100 \\, \\mu L$ without violating the glycerol concentration limit.\n\nFirst, we calculate the actual concentration of the enzyme stock after two freeze-thaw cycles. The initial stock concentration is $C_{stock,initial} = 10.0 \\, U/\\mu L$. Each cycle reduces activity by $12.0\\%$, meaning the activity is multiplied by a factor of $(1 - 0.12) = 0.88$. After two cycles ($n=2$), the active concentration is:\n$$ C_{stock,active} = C_{stock,initial} \\cdot (1 - 0.12)^n = 10.0 \\cdot (0.88)^2 = 10.0 \\cdot 0.7744 = 7.744 \\, U/\\mu L $$\nNext, we calculate the volume of this stock, $V_{enzyme}$, needed to supply the required $97.7 \\, U$:\n$$ V_{enzyme} = \\frac{E_{req}}{C_{stock,active}} = \\frac{97.699 \\, U}{7.744 \\, U/\\mu L} \\approx 12.616 \\, \\mu L $$\nThe enzyme stock solution contains $50\\%$ glycerol by volume ($f_{gly,stock} = 0.50$). The volume of glycerol added to the reaction is:\n$$ V_{gly} = V_{enzyme} \\cdot f_{gly,stock} \\approx 12.616 \\, \\mu L \\cdot 0.50 = 6.308 \\, \\mu L $$\nThe final fraction of glycerol in the total reaction volume of $V_{total} = 100 \\, \\mu L$ is:\n$$ f_{gly,final} = \\frac{V_{gly}}{V_{total}} \\approx \\frac{6.308 \\, \\mu L}{100 \\, \\mu L} = 0.06308 $$\nThe problem states that the final glycerol fraction must not exceed $0.05$ ($f_{gly,max} = 0.05$) to avoid star activity.\nSince $f_{gly,final} \\approx 0.063  0.05$, the glycerol constraint is violated.\n\nConclusion of verification: It is not possible to prepare a single $100 \\, \\mu L$ reaction that satisfies both the requirement for complete digestion (including the safety factor) and the constraint on the final glycerol concentration. The experimenter would need to modify the protocol, for example by increasing the total reaction volume or splitting the digestion into multiple tubes. However, the question asks for the minimum required units for the specified digestion conditions, which remains $97.7 \\, U$, irrespective of the subsequent formulation constraints.",
