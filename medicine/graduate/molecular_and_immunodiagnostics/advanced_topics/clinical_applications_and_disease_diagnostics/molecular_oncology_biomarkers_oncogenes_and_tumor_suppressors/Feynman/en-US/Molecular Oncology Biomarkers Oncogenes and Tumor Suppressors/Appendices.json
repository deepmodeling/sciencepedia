            "introduction": "A core task in molecular oncology is to move beyond simply detecting a mutation to understanding its role within the tumor's biology. The Variant Allele Frequency ($VAF$), a direct output of next-generation sequencing, provides a quantitative measure that, when combined with tumor purity estimates, allows us to infer the fraction of cancer cells harboring a specific variant. This exercise  guides you through the first principles of this calculation, demonstrating how to determine if a mutation is clonal (present in all tumor cells) or subclonal, a critical distinction for understanding tumor evolution and potential therapeutic resistance.",

            "problem": "A solid tumor specimen is profiled by targeted next-generation sequencing to evaluate a recurrent oncogenic substitution in Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) at codon 12 (G12D). The assay reports the Variant Allele Frequency (VAF), defined as the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the variant over all reads at the locus. The specimen has independently estimated tumor purity of $0.60$ by orthogonal histopathology and computational deconvolution, and the KRAS locus is diploid in both tumor and normal compartments based on copy-number analysis. Assume no allele-specific amplification bias, equal sampling probability of alleles, and no aneuploidy or subclonal copy-number changes at the KRAS locus.\n\nStarting from the definition of VAF as a mixture of tumor and normal allelic contributions, derive the expected VAF under clonal heterozygosity, defined as the variant being present on exactly one allele in $100\\%$ of tumor cells. Then, given an observed VAF of $0.18$, derive from first principles the cellular prevalence (also called Cancer Cell Fraction (CCF)), defined as the fraction $f$ of tumor cells that harbor the heterozygous KRAS G12D variant, consistent with the observed VAF under the same assumptions.\n\nProvide your final answer as the inferred cellular prevalence $f$ in decimal form, rounded to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard calculation in cancer genomics based on established principles. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent and realistic. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to derive the relationship between Variant Allele Frequency ($VAF$), tumor purity ($P$), and cellular prevalence ($f$) for a heterozygous mutation in a diploid locus, and then use this relationship to calculate $f$ from given values of $VAF$ and $P$.\n\nLet $P$ be the tumor purity, defined as the fraction of tumor cells in the specimen. The fraction of normal, non-cancerous cells is therefore $(1-P)$.\nLet $f$ be the cellular prevalence, also known as the Cancer Cell Fraction ($CCF$), defined as the fraction of tumor cells that harbor the specific genetic variant.\n\nWe are given the following assumptions:\n1.  The `KRAS` locus is diploid in both tumor and normal cell compartments. This means every cell contains exactly two alleles of the `KRAS` gene.\n2.  The mutation is a heterozygous substitution. This means that in a mutated cell, one allele is the variant (mutant) and one is the wild-type.\n3.  Normal cells do not carry the somatic mutation; they are homozygous wild-type.\n4.  There is no copy-number alteration at the locus, no allele-specific amplification, and equal sampling probability of all alleles.\n\nThe $VAF$ is the fraction of sequencing reads carrying the variant allele. Under the assumption of equal sampling, the $VAF$ is equal to the proportion of variant alleles out of the total number of alleles at that locus in the sequenced cell population.\n\nLet us model the allele content of the sample. We consider the contribution of alleles from the tumor compartment and the normal compartment separately.\n\nThe total pool of alleles at the `KRAS` locus is a mixture from two populations:\n1.  **Normal cells**: Constitute a fraction $(1-P)$ of the total cells. All cells are diploid and homozygous wild-type. Thus, they contribute zero variant alleles.\n2.  **Tumor cells**: Constitute a fraction $P$ of the total cells. This population is itself a mixture:\n    - A fraction $f$ of tumor cells are mutated. Since the mutation is heterozygous and the locus is diploid, each of these cells has one variant allele and one wild-type allele. The proportion of variant alleles in this sub-population is $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n    - A fraction $(1-f)$ of tumor cells are not mutated (wild-type). These cells have two wild-type alleles and contribute zero variant alleles.\n\nThe total number of variant alleles in the sample is proportional to the number of mutated tumor cells. The number of mutated tumor cells is proportional to $P \\times f$. Each of these cells contributes one variant allele.\n\nThe total number of alleles at the locus in the sample is proportional to the total number of cells, with each cell contributing two alleles (due to diploidy).\n\nLet's formalize this. Consider a representative sample of $N$ total cells.\n-   Number of tumor cells = $P \\times N$.\n-   Number of normal cells = $(1-P) \\times N$.\n-   Number of tumor cells with the variant = $f \\times (P \\times N) = fPN$.\n-   Number of variant alleles contributed by mutated tumor cells = $1 \\times (fPN) = fPN$.\n-   Number of variant alleles contributed by normal cells = $0$.\n-   Total number of variant alleles in the sample = $fPN$.\n-   Total number of alleles at the locus from all cells = $2 \\times N$ (since all cells are diploid).\n\nThe $VAF$ is the ratio of the total number of variant alleles to the total number of all alleles:\n$$VAF = \\frac{\\text{Total variant alleles}}{\\text{Total alleles}} = \\frac{fPN}{2N}$$\nBy cancelling the variable $N$, we arrive at the general formula relating these quantities:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\times P}{2}$$\n\nThe first part of the problem asks for the expected $VAF$ under clonal heterozygosity. Clonal heterozygosity is defined as the variant being present in $100\\%$ of tumor cells. This corresponds to a cellular prevalence of $f=1$.\nSubstituting $f=1$ into our derived formula gives:\n$$VAF_{\\text{clonal}} = \\frac{1 \\times P}{2} = \\frac{P}{2}$$\nGiven the tumor purity $P = 0.60$, the expected $VAF$ for a clonal heterozygous mutation would be:\n$$VAF_{\\text{clonal}} = \\frac{0.60}{2} = 0.30$$\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to derive the cellular prevalence $f$ that is consistent with an observed $VAF$. We can rearrange our general formula to solve for $f$:\n$$VAF = \\frac{f \\times P}{2}$$\n$$2 \\times VAF = f \\times P$$\n$$f = \\frac{2 \\times VAF}{P}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the cellular prevalence $f$.\n\nWe are given an observed $VAF$ of $0.18$ and a tumor purity $P$ of $0.60$. We substitute these values into the expression for $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{2 \\times 0.18}{0.60}$$\n$$f = \\frac{0.36}{0.60}$$\n$$f = \\frac{36}{60} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the inferred cellular prevalence $f$ is $0.6000$. This indicates that the `KRAS` G12D mutation is present in approximately $60\\%$ of the tumor cells in the specimen, meaning it is a subclonal mutation.",

            "problem": "A clinical molecular laboratory receives a tumor-only next-generation sequencing panel for an epithelial carcinoma. The laboratory must distinguish germline from somatic variants without matched normal, using three pillars of evidence: population allele frequency databases, variant allele frequency (VAF) patterns under mixture modeling, and local copy-number state. The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) population minor allele frequency (MAF) is available for each variant. The tumor purity is independently estimated at $p = 0.60$. For each locus, allele-specific copy-number analysis indicates one of the following states: copy-number neutral diploid with no loss of heterozygosity (LOH) (total tumor copies $C_t = 2$), hemizygous deletion with LOH (total tumor copies $C_t = 1$), or balanced single-copy gain without LOH (total tumor copies $C_t = 3$ with equal allelic representation).\n\nFrom first principles, recall that sequencing VAF in a tumor-only sample reflects a mixture of tumor DNA (fraction $p$) and normal DNA (fraction $1 - p$) and the number of mutant and wild-type alleles contributed by each compartment at the locus under its copy-number state.

            "solution": "## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Context**: A tumor-only next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel for an epithelial carcinoma.\n- **Objective**: Distinguish germline from somatic variants.\n- **Data sources**:\n    1.  Population minor allele frequency (MAF) from gnomAD.\n    2.  Variant allele frequency (VAF) from tumor-only sequencing.\n    3.  Local copy-number state.\n- **Constants and Parameters**:\n    -   Tumor purity, $p = 0.60$.\n    -   Normal tissue fraction, $1 - p = 0.40$.\n    -   Normal cell copy number is assumed diploid, $C_n = 2$.\n- **Possible Tumor Copy-Number States**:\n    1.  Copy-number neutral diploid, no loss of heterozygosity (LOH): total tumor copies $C_t = 2$.\n    2.  Hemizygous deletion with LOH: total tumor copies $C_t = 1$.\n    3.

The mixture model for VAF in a tumor sample with normal cell contamination is a standard, validated model. The use of population frequency (gnomAD), VAF, and copy number analysis represents the standard-of-care methodology for interpreting variants from tumor-only sequencing. All genes mentioned are highly relevant to oncology. The problem is free of pseudoscience and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary quantitative data ($p$, VAFs, MAFs, copy number states) and a clear objective: to identify which of the four given policies successfully reproduces a specified set of classifications. This is a solvable problem of evaluation.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language standard to the field of molecular diagnostics. The data is quantitative, and the criteria for success are unambiguous.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is not factually unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or unrealistic. The requested task is a non-trivial application of established models, central to the field of clinical genomics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will now proceed to the solution.\n\n## Solution Derivation\n\n### First Principles: VAF Mixture Model\n\nThe variant allele frequency (VAF) observed in a bulk tumor sample is a weighted average of the allele fractions in the tumor and normal cell populations. The general formula is:\n$$ \\mathrm{VAF} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant}}}{N_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{p \\cdot m_t + (1-p) \\cdot m_n}{p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n} $$\nwhere:\n- $p = 0.60$ is the tumor purity.\n- $1-p = 0.40$ is the normal cell fraction.\n- $m_t$ is the number of mutant alleles in a tumor cell at the locus.\n- $m_n$ is the number of mutant alleles in a normal cell at the locus.\n- $C_t$ is the total copy number of the locus in a tumor cell.\n- $C_n$ is the total copy number of the locus in a normal cell, assumed to be diploid ($C_n = 2$).\n\nWe will calculate the expected VAF for a heterozygous germline variant ($m_n = 1$) and a clonal heterozygous somatic variant ($m_n = 0$, $m_t$ is typically $1$ initially) for each copy number state.\n\n### Case 1: Copy-Neutral Diploid, No LOH ($C_t = 2$)\nThe denominator is $p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.60 \\cdot 2) + (0.40 \\cdot 2) = 1.2 + 0.8 = 2.0$.\n- **Germline (het)**: The variant is present in all cells. Normal cells have one mutant allele ($m_n=1$). Tumor cells also retain the heterozygous state ($m_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{germ}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 1}{2.0} = \\frac{1.0}{2.0} = 0.50 $$\n- **Somatic (het)**: The variant is only in tumor cells ($m_n=0$), with one mutant allele ($m_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{som}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 0}{2.0} = \\frac{0.60}{2.0} = 0.30 \\quad (= p/2) $$\n\n### Case 2: Hemizygous Deletion with LOH ($C_t = 1$)\nThe denominator is $p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.60 \\cdot 1) + (0.40 \\cdot 2) = 0.6 + 0.8 = 1.4$.\n- **Germline (het) with LOH**: The patient is heterozygous ($m_n=1$). In the tumor, the wild-type allele is lost, leaving only the mutant allele ($m_t=1, C_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{germ+LOH}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 1}{1.4} = \\frac{1.0}{1.4} \\approx 0.714 \\quad (= 1/(2-p)) $$\n- **Somatic (het) with LOH**: A somatic mutation occurs, then the wild-type allele is lost. Normal cells are wild-type ($m_n=0$). Tumor cells have only the mutant allele ($m_t=1, C_t=1$).\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{som+LOH}} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 0}{1.4} = \\frac{0.60}{1.4} \\approx 0.429 \\quad (= p/(2-p)) $$\n\n### Case 3: Balanced Single-Copy Gain without LOH ($C_t = 3$)\nThe denominator is $p \\cdot C_t + (1-p) \\cdot C_n = (0.60 \\cdot 3) + (0.40 \\cdot 2) = 1.8 + 0.8 = 2.6$.\n- **Germline (het)**: Normal cells are heterozygous ($m_n=1$). In tumor cells, one of the original alleles is duplicated. This results in either one mutant and two wild-type alleles ($m_t=1$) or two mutant and one wild-type allele ($m_t=2$). We must consider both.\n- **Somatic (het)**: A somatic mutation creates a heterozygous state in the tumor progenitor ($m_n=0$). Then a copy-gain occurs. For an activating oncogene (like PIK3CA), amplification of the mutant allele is possible ($m_t=2, C_t=3$). However, a simple gain of one chromosome copy could also duplicate the wild-type allele ($m_t=1, C_t=3$). For variant S4 (VAF=$0.19$), we will test the simplest model where one mutant allele is present in tumor cells.\n  $$ \\mathrm{VAF}_{\\text{som, } m_t=1} = \\frac{0.60 \\cdot 1 + 0.40 \\cdot 0}{2.6} = \\frac{0.60}{2.6} \\approx 0.231 $$\nThis expected VAF of $0.231$ is close to the observed VAF of $0.19$ for S4, so we will proceed with the assumption that $m_t=1$ for somatic events in this copy number state.\n\n### Summary of Theoretical VAFs and Variant Analysis\n- **S1 (BRCA1, CN=2)**: VAF=$0.49$. This is very close to the expected germline VAF of $0.50$. Goal: Germline.\n- **S2 (KRAS, CN=2)**: VAF=$0.31$. This is very close to the expected somatic VAF of $0.30$. Goal: Somatic.\n- **S3 (TP53, CN=1)**: VAF=$0.74$. This is very close to the expected germline+LOH VAF of $0.714$. Goal: Germline.\n- **S4 (PIK3CA, CN=3)**: VAF=$0.19$. This is close to the expected somatic VAF ($m_t=1$) of $0.231$. Goal: Somatic.\n- **S5 (PMS2, CN=1)**: VAF=$0.66$. This is closer to the expected germline+LOH VAF of $0.714$ than the somatic+LOH VAF of $0.429$. Goal: Germline.\n\nThe theoretical calculations corroborate the desired classifications. Now, we evaluate each policy.\n\n---\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Policy A**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-3}$.\n  - No variants meet this threshold (S1 MAF$=2 \\times 10^{-5}$, S5 MAF$=5 \\times 10^{-5}$, others are $0$). All variants proceed to VAF rules.\n- **S1 (Goal: Germline)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.49$.

Correct.\n- **S2 (Goal: Somatic)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.31$. Rule: $\\lvert \\mathrm{VAF} - (p/2) \\rvert \\le 0.10$.\n  - Calculation: $p/2=0.30$. $\\lvert 0.31 - 0.30 \\rvert = 0.01$, which is $\\le 0.10$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Somatic**. Correct.\n- **S3 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.74$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\ge \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - p}\\right) - 0.07$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - 0.60}\\right) - 0.07 = \\dfrac{1}{1.4} - 0.07 \\approx 0.714 - 0.07 = 0.644$. VAF $0.74 \\ge 0.644$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Germline**. Correct.\n- **S4 (Goal: Somatic)**: Balanced gain, VAF=$0.19$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\le \\dfrac{p \\cdot 1}{p \\cdot 3 + (1 - p)\\cdot 2} + 0.10$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $\\dfrac{0.60}{0.60 \\cdot 3 + 0.40 \\cdot 2} + 0.10 = \\dfrac{0.60}{2.6} + 0.10 \\approx 0.231 + 0.10 = 0.331$. VAF $0.19 \\le 0.331$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Somatic**. Correct.\n- **S5 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.66$. Rule: $\\mathrm{VAF} \\ge \\left(\\dfrac{1}{2 - p}\\right) - 0.07$.\n  - Calculation: Threshold is $0.644$. VAF $0.66 \\ge 0.644$.\n  - Classification: **Likely Germline**. Correct.\n\nAll five variants are classified correctly according to the problem requirements, and no uncertain classifications are produced. The formulas used in the policy are directly derived from the first-principles mixture model.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n---\n**B. Policy B**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-2}$. None qualify.\n- **CN-neutral diploid rules**:\n  - `“likely germline” if VAF in [0.25, 0.35]`\n  - `“likely somatic” if VAF in [0.45, 0.55]`\n  These rules are the reverse of the correct theoretical expectations. A VAF near $0.50$ is characteristic of a germline variant, while a VAF near $p/2=0.30$ is characteristic of a somatic variant.\n- **S1 (Goal: Germline)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.49$. The policy classifies this as \"likely somatic\" because $0.49$ is in the range $[0.45, 0.55]$. This is incorrect.\nThe fundamental logic of this policy is flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**C. Policy C**\n- **Population rule**: \"likely germline\" if MAF $\\ge 10^{-4}$. None qualify.\n- **S2 (Goal: Somatic)**: CN-neutral, VAF=$0.31$. Rule: `“likely somatic” if |VAF - p| ≤ 0.05`.\n  - Calculation: $p=0.60$. $\\lvert 0.31 - 0.60 \\rvert = 0.29$, which is not $\\le 0.05$.\n  - This rule is based on an incorrect theoretical VAF for a heterozygous somatic mutation, which should be $p/2$, not $p$. The policy fails to classify S2 as somatic. Since it also doesn't fit the germline rule ($\\lvert 0.31 - 0.50 \\rvert = 0.19 > 0.05$), S2 is left uncertain. The problem requires no uncertain classifications.\nThe somatic VAF rule for the copy-neutral case is theoretically incorrect and leads to an uncertain classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**D. Policy D**\n- **Population rule**: Not used.\n- **S5 (Goal: Germline)**: Hemizygous LOH, VAF=$0.66$. Rule: `“likely germline” if VAF ≥ 0.72` or `“likely somatic” if VAF ≤ 0.50`.\n  - Calculation: The VAF of $0.66$ does not satisfy either condition. $0.66 < 0.72$ and $0.66 > 0.50$.\n  - Therefore, this policy fails to classify S5. The problem requires that no variants are left uncertain.\nThe rules for the hemizygous deletion case leave a gap where S5 falls, resulting in an uncertain classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n---\n**Conclusion**\nOnly Policy A correctly applies theoretically sound VAF mixture models to classify all five variants as specified in the problem statement, without producing any uncertain results.",

Calculating an accurate $TMB$ is a multi-step process that requires not only the correct identification of somatic variants but also rigorous normalization to account for the specific genomic territory interrogated by an assay. This exercise  provides a hands-on simulation of a real-world bioinformatics pipeline, tasking you with applying a series of filters to raw variant calls and calculating the final, clinically comparable $TMB$ value.",

            "problem": "A molecular oncology laboratory is validating Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) as an immunodiagnostic biomarker across a hybrid-capture targeted panel enriched for oncogenes and tumor suppressors. The assay uses Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) on matched tumor-normal samples, and variants are post-processed to remove germline and technical artifacts. Starting from core definitions, recall that a somatic mutation is a change in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) present in the tumor that is not present in the matched normal, and that the intended TMB metric counts only coding, non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and insertion-deletion variants (indels) within the panel’s callable territory. Callable territory is the subset of the panel’s baited footprint that meets predefined depth and quality thresholds and excludes low-mappability segments. Use these foundations to justify why normalization by callable megabases is required when comparing TMB across panels, and then compute the panel-normalized TMB for the following specimen.\n\nThe targeted panel’s baited coding footprint is $1{,}600{,}000$ base pairs. A base is considered callable if coverage is at least $100\\times$ and mapping/base quality thresholds are met. On this specimen:\n- The callable fraction of the baited footprint under these thresholds is $0.91$.\n- After excluding segmental duplications and low-mappability regions, an additional $40{,}000$ bases are removed.\n- Sample-specific low base quality filtering removes a further $16{,}000$ bases.\n\nVariant calling on the tumor sample reports $84$ SNVs and $10$ indels within baited targets. The following filters and classifications apply:\n- Matched-normal filtering removes $29$ SNVs and $3$ indels as germline.\n- Population database filtering removes $7$ additional SNVs as likely germline (minor allele frequency above the laboratory threshold).\n- Technical artifact filtering removes $5$ SNVs (orientation bias) and $1$ indel (low mapping quality).\n- Functional consequence classification removes $8$ SNVs as synonymous.\n- Locus-context classification removes $4$ SNVs and $2$ indels as noncoding (outside coding exons).\n- Deduplication across overlapping capture baits removes $3$ duplicated SNV calls among the remaining SNVs.\n\nOnly unique, high-confidence, somatic, coding, non-synonymous SNVs and indels within the callable territory count toward TMB. Using the foundational definitions specified, derive the expression for panel-normalized TMB and compute its value for this specimen. Express the final TMB in mutations per megabase. Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n**Definitions and Principles:**\n-   Somatic mutation: A change in DNA present in the tumor but not in the matched normal sample.\n-   TMB metric: Counts only coding, non-synonymous Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) and insertion-deletion variants (indels) within the panel’s callable territory.\n-   Callable territory: The subset of the panel’s baited footprint that meets predefined depth and quality thresholds and excludes low-mappability segments.\n\n**Panel and Territory Data:**\n-   Baited coding footprint size: $1{,}600{,}000$ base pairs.\n-   Callable fraction of baited footprint (due to depth/quality): $0.91$.\n-   Bases removed due to segmental duplications and low-mappability: $40{,}000$.\n-   Bases removed due to sample-specific low base quality filtering: $16{,}000$.\n\n**Variant Data and Filters:**\n-   Initial raw calls: $84$ SNVs and $10$ indels.\n-   Germline filter (matched-normal): Removes $29$ SNVs and $3$ indels.\n-   Population DB filter: Removes $7$ SNVs.\n-   Technical artifact filter: Removes $5$ SNVs and $1$ indel.\n-   Functional consequence filter: Removes $8$ synonymous SNVs.\n-   Locus-context filter: Removes $4$ SNVs and $2$ indels (noncoding).\n-   Deduplication filter: Removes $3$ duplicated SNV calls.\n\n**Required Outputs:**\n1.  Justification for normalization by callable megabases.\n2.  Derivation of the expression for panel-normalized TMB.\n3.  Computation of the TMB value (mutations per megabase), rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of molecular oncology, bioinformatics, and next-generation sequencing data analysis. The concepts of TMB, somatic vs. germline variants, SNVs, indels, synonymous vs. non-synonymous mutations, callable territory, and normalization are standard and central to the field of immunodiagnostics.\n-   **Well-Posed:** All necessary data for the calculation are provided. The objectives are clearly stated, leading to a unique, meaningful solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is described using precise, technical, and unbiased language.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides a full set of data for calculating both the numerator (variant count) and denominator (callable territory size) of the TMB. While the description of the calculation for the callable territory size could be structured more formally, the sequential language (\"additional\", \"further\") provides a clear, albeit potentially non-standard, path for calculation, which does not introduce a logical contradiction.\n-   **Realism and Feasibility:** The values provided for panel size, callable fraction, and variant counts are realistic for a targeted sequencing panel applied to a solid tumor specimen.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Justification for Normalization**\n\nTumor Mutational Burden (TMB) is a quantitative biomarker intended to represent the density of mutations within a tumor's genome, which correlates with the production of neoantigens and potential response to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Different diagnostic assays, such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and targeted gene panels, interrogate genomic regions of vastly different sizes. A larger interrogated region will, by statistical probability, detect a higher absolute number of mutations than a smaller region for the same tumor. To make TMB measurements comparable and independent of the specific assay used, the raw mutation count must be normalized. The normalization factor is the size of the genomic territory in which mutations could have been reliably detected by the assay. This is not simply the baited footprint, but the *callable territory*—the portion of the footprint that passes stringent quality control metrics for sequencing depth, mapping quality, and other technical parameters. By dividing the number of qualified mutations by the size of the callable territory (typically expressed in megabases, Mb), one obtains a normalized rate (mutations/Mb). This normalization ensures that the TMB reflects the intrinsic biology of the tumor rather than the technical specifications of the assay, thereby enabling the use of consistent clinical decision-making thresholds across different laboratories and sequencing platforms.\n\n**Derivation and Computation of TMB**\n\nThe panel-normalized TMB is defined by the following expression:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mut-somatic}}}{S_{\\text{callable}} / 10^6}\n$$\nwhere $N_{\\text{mut-somatic}}$ is the total count of qualified somatic mutations (coding, non-synonymous SNVs and indels) and $S_{\\text{callable}}$ is the size of the callable territory in base pairs. The factor of $10^6$ converts the denominator to megabases (Mb).\n\n**1. Calculation of the Numerator ($N_{\\text{mut-somatic}}$)**\n\nWe must determine the number of mutations that satisfy all specified criteria by sequentially applying the filters.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{SNV,final}}$ be the final count of qualified SNVs.\nStarting with $N_{\\text{SNV,raw}} = 84$:\n-   After matched-normal filtering: $84 - 29 = 55$\n-   After population database filtering: $55 - 7 = 48$\n-   After technical artifact filtering: $48 - 5 = 43$\n-   After functional consequence filtering (removing synonymous): $43 - 8 = 35$\n-   After locus-context filtering (removing noncoding): $35 - 4 = 31$\n-   After deduplication: $31 - 3 = 28$\nSo, $N_{\\text{SNV,final}} = 28$.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{indel,final}}$ be the final count of qualified indels.\nStarting with $N_{\\text{indel,raw}} = 10$:\n-   After matched-normal filtering: $10 - 3 = 7$\n-   After technical artifact filtering: $7 - 1 = 6$\n-   After locus-context filtering (removing noncoding): $6 - 2 = 4$\nSo, $N_{\\text{indel,final}} = 4$.\n\nThe total number of qualified somatic mutations is the sum of the final SNV and indel counts:\n$$\nN_{\\text{mut-somatic}} = N_{\\text{SNV,final}} + N_{\\text{indel,final}} = 28 + 4 = 32\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Denominator ($S_{\\text{callable}}$)**\n\nThe callable territory size is calculated by sequentially applying the specified reductions to the baited footprint.\n\n-   The initial baited coding footprint is $S_{\\text{baited}} = 1{,}600{,}000$ base pairs.\n-   The callable fraction due to depth and quality thresholds is $0.91$. The size of the region meeting these criteria is:\n    $S_1 = S_{\\text{baited}} \\times 0.91 = 1{,}600{,}000 \\times 0.91 = 1{,}456{,}000$ base pairs.\n-   An \"additional\" $40{,}000$ bases are removed for segmental duplications and low-mappability regions. This subtraction is applied to the current size:\n    $S_2 = S_1 - 40{,}000 = 1{,}456{,}000 - 40{,}000 = 1{,}416{,}000$ base pairs.\n-   A \"further\" $16{,}000$ bases are removed due to sample-specific low base quality:\n    $S_{\\text{callable}} = S_2 - 16{,}000 = 1{,}416{,}000 - 16{,}000 = 1{,}400{,}000$ base pairs.\n\nTo express this in megabases (Mb), we divide by $10^6$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{callable, Mb}} = \\frac{1{,}400{,}000}{10^6} = 1.4 \\text{ Mb}\n$$\n\n**3. Final TMB Calculation**\n\nSubstituting the calculated numerator and denominator into the TMB formula:\n$$\n\\text{TMB} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mut-somatic}}}{S_{\\text{callable, Mb}}} = \\frac{32}{1.4} \\approx 22.8571428...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\text{TMB} \\approx 22.86 \\text{ mutations/Mb}\n$$",
