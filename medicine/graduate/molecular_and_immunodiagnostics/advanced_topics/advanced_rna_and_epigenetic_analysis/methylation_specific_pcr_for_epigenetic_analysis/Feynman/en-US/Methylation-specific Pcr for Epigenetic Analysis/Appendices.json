            "problem": "A researcher plans a methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP; methylation-specific PCR) assay targeting a single-copy locus per haploid genome to detect cytosine methylation after sodium bisulfite conversion. The sample input to the MSP reaction is $10\\,\\mathrm{ng}$ of human genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), where the human genome is diploid and the mass of one haploid genome is $3.3\\,\\mathrm{pg}$. Assume perfect sodium bisulfite conversion, perfect primer specificity for the methylated sequence, and that DNA molecules are randomly sampled into the reaction such that the number of methylated target molecules entering the MSP is well described by a Poisson process. The researcher defines the detection threshold as the condition that the probability of having at least one methylated target molecule in the reaction is at least $0.95$.\n\nStarting only from core definitions and well-tested facts about genome mass, copy number, random molecular sampling, and the Poisson distribution, first determine the expected number of copies of the target locus present in the $10\\,\\mathrm{ng}$ input.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum methylated-allele fraction, $f_{\\min}$, that can be detected with at least a $95\\%$ probability in a methylation-specific PCR (MSP) assay, given a specific input amount of human genomic DNA. The solution involves two main parts: first, calculating the total number of target DNA molecules in the sample, and second, applying Poisson statistics to model the detection probability.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected total number of copies of the target locus, denoted by $N$, present in the $10\\,\\mathrm{ng}$ input of human genomic DNA.\nThe given data are:\nTotal mass of input DNA, $M_{total} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\nMass of one haploid human genome, $M_{haploid} = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{pg}$.\n\nTo calculate the number of genomes, the units of mass must be consistent. We convert nanograms ($\\mathrm{ng}$) to picograms ($\\mathrm{pg}$) using the relationship $1\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 10^3\\,\\mathrm{pg}$.\n$$M_{total} = 10\\,\\mathrm{ng} \\times \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{pg}}{1\\,\\mathrm{ng}} = 10^4\\,\\mathrm{pg}$$\nThe number of haploid genome equivalents ($N_{GE}$) in the sample is the ratio of the total mass of DNA to the mass of a single haploid genome.\n$$N_{GE} = \\frac{M_{total}}{M_{haploid}} = \\frac{10^4\\,\\mathrm{pg}}{3.3\\,\\mathrm{pg}}$$\nThe problem states that the target is a single-copy locus per haploid genome. Therefore, the expected total number of target-locus copies, $N$, is equal to the number of haploid genome equivalents.\n$$N = \\frac{10^4}{3.3}$$\n\nSecond, we model the detection process using the Poisson distribution. The number of methylated target molecules, $X$, randomly sampled into the reaction is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, $X \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$. The mean of this distribution, $\\lambda$, is the expected number of methylated target molecules. It is given by the product of the methylated-allele fraction, $f$, and the total number of target molecules, $N$.\n$$\\lambda = f N$$\nThe probability mass function for the Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of events (methylated molecules), which can be $0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nThe detection threshold is defined as the condition that the probability of having at least one methylated target molecule in the reaction is at least $0.95$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$P(X \\ge 1) \\ge 0.95$$\nThe probability of observing at least one molecule is the complement of observing zero molecules, i.e., $P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$1 - P(X=0) \\ge 0.95$$\nThe probability of observing zero methylated molecules ($k=0$) is:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality:\n$$1 - \\exp(-\\lambda) \\ge 0.95$$\nWe rearrange the inequality to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) \\le 1 - 0.95$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda) \\le 0.05$$\nTo isolate $\\lambda$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(\\exp(-\\lambda)) \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$-\\lambda \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the direction of the inequality:\n$$\\lambda \\ge -\\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the logarithm property $-\\ln(x) = \\ln(1/x)$, we have:\n$$\\lambda \\ge \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{0.05}\\right) = \\ln(20)$$\nThe minimum mean number of methylated molecules required to meet the detection threshold is therefore $\\lambda_{\\min} = \\ln(20)$.\n\nThe minimum methylated-allele fraction, $f_{\\min}$, corresponds to this minimum value of $\\lambda$. We use the relationship $\\lambda = f N$:\n$$f_{\\min} N = \\lambda_{\\min} = \\ln(20)$$\nSolving for $f_{\\min}$:\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{N}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $N$ that we derived earlier:\n$$f_{\\min} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{10^4 / 3.3} = \\frac{3.3 \\times \\ln(20)}{10^4}$$\nTo obtain the final numerical answer, we use the value for $\\ln(20) \\approx 2.995732$:\n$$f_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{3.3 \\times 2.995732}{10000}$$\n$$f_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{9.8859156}{10000}$$\n$$f_{\\min} \\approx 0.00098859156$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "In a bisulfite-based epigenetic assay, unmethylated cytosine residues are deaminated to uracil with a per-site conversion probability $p$ during sodium bisulfite treatment, while methylated cytosines remain as cytosines. Consider an unmethylated locus comprising $20$ CpG dinucleotide sites. Assume that conversion events at distinct CpG cytosines are independent and identically distributed, and that downstream polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification accurately copies the bisulfite-converted template (i.e., no additional sequence errors are introduced during copying that affect cytosine identity). Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) primer specificity relies on the expectation that all unmethylated CpG cytosines within the primer-binding region are converted; any residual unconverted cytosine can mimic methylation and promote mis-priming.\n\nStarting from the Bernoulli-trial model for independent chemical conversions and the complement rule for probabilities, derive an expression for the expected fraction of bisulfite-treated DNA molecules that retain at least one unconverted cytosine across these $20$ CpG sites as a function of $p$ and the number of sites. Then evaluate this expression at $p = 0.99$ for the given locus of $20$ CpGs. Round your final numerical result to four significant figures and report it as a pure decimal (no units). After computing the number, briefly explain how this fraction affects MSP primer specificity in terms of potential false-positive priming on truly unmethylated templates.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an expression for the expected fraction of bisulfite-treated DNA molecules that retain at least one unconverted cytosine, followed by a numerical evaluation and a conceptual explanation regarding Methylation-Specific PCR (MSP) specificity.\n\nThe process of bisulfite conversion at each of the $N$ CpG sites can be modeled as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. Let $N$ be the number of CpG sites, which is given as $N=20$. Let $p$ be the per-site probability of a successful conversion of an unmethylated cytosine to a uracil. The problem states this probability is $p=0.99$.\n\nFor a single unmethylated CpG site, the outcome is binary:\n1. The cytosine is successfully converted to uracil, with probability $p$.\n2. The cytosine fails to convert and remains a cytosine, with probability $1-p$.\n\nThe problem asks for the fraction of molecules that retain *at least one* unconverted cytosine. Let $A$ be the event that a DNA molecule has at least one unconverted cytosine across the $N=20$ sites. It is more straightforward to first calculate the probability of the complement event, $A^c$, which is the event that *no* cytosines remain unconverted. This is equivalent to the event that *all* $N$ cytosines are successfully converted to uracil.\n\nSince the conversion events at each of the $N$ sites are assumed to be independent and identically distributed, the probability of all $N$ sites being converted is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(A^c) = P(\\text{site 1 converted AND site 2 converted AND ... AND site N converted})$$\n$$P(A^c) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(\\text{site i converted}) = p \\times p \\times \\dots \\times p = p^N$$\nThe desired probability, $P(A)$, is the probability of the complement of $A^c$. Using the complement rule for probabilities, we have:\n$$P(A) = 1 - P(A^c)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(A^c)$, we arrive at the general expression for the fraction of molecules with at least one unconverted cytosine as a function of $p$ and the number of sites $N$:\n$$P(A) = 1 - p^N$$\nThis is the required derived expression.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this expression for the given values: $N=20$ CpG sites and a conversion probability of $p=0.99$.\n$$P(A) = 1 - (0.99)^{20}$$\nCalculating the value of $(0.99)^{20}$:\n$$(0.99)^{20} \\approx 0.817906939...$$\nNow, we find the final probability:\n$$P(A) = 1 - 0.817906939... \\approx 0.182093061...$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $8$, $2$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $9$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$P(A) \\approx 0.1821$$\nThis is the expected fraction of molecules from a completely unmethylated locus that will be incompletely converted.\n\nFinally, the explanation of how this fraction affects MSP primer specificity:\nMethylation-Specific PCR (MSP) uses two pairs of primers: one pair (M-primers) is designed to anneal to DNA sequences where CpG cytosines were methylated and thus remained as cytosines after bisulfite treatment, and another pair (U-primers) is designed for sequences where CpGs were unmethylated and thus converted to uracils (which are then read as thymines by the polymerase). The specificity of the M-primer pair relies on mismatches with converted (uracil/thymine) sites in unmethylated templates, which should prevent annealing and amplification.\n\nThe calculated fraction, approximately $0.1821$ or $18.21\\%$, represents the proportion of DNA molecules originating from a completely unmethylated locus that, due to incomplete conversion, retain at least one cytosine at a CpG position. These molecules now possess a sequence that can be recognized by the M-primer, mimicking a truly methylated template. When the M-primer anneals to such an incompletely converted unmethylated template, it can initiate amplification, leading to a PCR product in the \"methylated\" reaction. This phenomenon constitutes a false-positive result for methylation, as it indicates the presence of methylation where none existed. A value of $0.1821$ suggests that a substantial fraction of the unmethylated template population can serve as a substrate for false-positive priming, thereby significantly reducing the specificity of the MSP assay and its ability to accurately discriminate between methylated and unmethylated states.",

A fundamental consequence of Watson–Crick base pairing and template-directed synthesis is that DNA polymerase extension is highly dependent on a correct base pair at the primer’s terminal $3'$ nucleotide; mismatches at the $3'$ end strongly suppress extension, whereas internal mismatches are less inhibitory. Consider designing a forward primer to detect a methylated allele in a locus where the last few nucleotides of the primer may overlap CpG sites.\n\nAssume the following well-tested observations as quantitative proxies for extension on an unmethylated template after bisulfite treatment:\n\n- Each unmethylated CpG cytosine independently fails to convert with probability $p = 0.01$ per site; otherwise it converts to thymine with probability $1-p$.\n- Conditional on a given conversion outcome at the last few nucleotides, the per-cycle extension probability on an unmethylated template is:\n  - $e_{\\text{match}} = 1$ if the primer’s last base(s) match(s) perfectly at the $3'$ end.\n  - $e_{3'\\text{-mm}} = r = 0.02$ for a single $3'$ mismatch with no penultimate mismatch.\n  - $e_{\\text{penult-mm only}} = s = 0.20$ for a penultimate mismatch with a matched $3'$ end.\n  - $e_{-1,-2\\text{ mm}} = t = 0.0005$ for simultaneous mismatches at positions $-1$ (the $3'$ base) and $-2$.\n- For triple mismatches at positions $-1$, $-2$, and $-3$, assume a conservative upper bound $e_{-1,-2,-3\\text{ mm}} \\leq w = 1\\times 10^{-5}$.\n- On the methylated target, which retains cytosines at CpG sites, any base designed to pair with cytosine at positions $-1$, $-2$, and $-3$ will match, yielding extension probability $E_{\\text{target}} \\approx 1$ unless deliberate non-CpG mismatches are introduced. A design is considered efficient if $E_{\\text{target}} \\geq E_{\\min} = 0.90$.\n\nFour candidate primer-end designs are proposed for the $3'$ terminal region (positions $-1$ is the $3'$ base, then $-2$, $-3$):\n\nA.

Internal CpG discrimination: avoid CpGs at positions $-1$ and $-2$; include a CpG only at an internal position (e.g., $-7$), with no intentional mismatches in the last $3$ bases.\n\nD.

Expected per-cycle false-positive extension probability on unmethylated templates, $F$, must be less than $0.5\\%$, i.e., $F < 0.005$.\n\nThe problem states that for the methylated target, a primer designed to interrogate CpG sites will match perfectly, yielding an extension probability $E_{\\text{target}} \\approx 1$. Since all proposed designs are for detecting the methylated allele and avoid other deliberate mismatches, they all satisfy the first criterion, as $1 \\geq 0.90$. The analysis therefore focuses entirely on calculating $F$ for each design and comparing it to the threshold of $0.005$.\n\nThe expected false-positive probability, $F$, is the average of the extension probabilities over all possible outcomes of bisulfite conversion at the relevant CpG sites on an unmethylated template. A methyl-specific primer is designed with Guanine ($G$) bases to pair with Cytosine ($C$) at CpG sites. On an unmethylated template, the Cytosine at a CpG site is converted to Uracil ($U$), which is read as Thymine ($T$), with probability $1-p = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$. This creates a $G-T$ mismatch. Incomplete conversion occurs with probability $p = 0.01$, where the Cytosine remains a Cytosine, leading to a correct $G-C$ base pair.\n\nThe formula for the expected extension probability is:\n$$F = \\sum_{\\text{outcomes}} P(\\text{outcome}) \\times e_{\\text{outcome}}$$\nwhere $P(\\text{outcome})$ is the probability of a specific combination of conversion successes and failures, and $e_{\\text{outcome}}$ is the corresponding polymerase extension probability given the resulting match/mismatch pattern at the primer's $3'$ end.\n\nThe given extension probabilities ($e$) on an unmethylated template are:\n- Perfect match at $3'$ end: $e_{\\text{match}} = 1$\n- Mismatch at $-1$, match at $-2$: $e_{3'\\text{-mm}} = r = 0.02$\n- Match at $-1$, mismatch at $-2$: $e_{\\text{penult-mm only}} = s = 0.20$\n- Mismatch at $-1$ and $-2$: $e_{-1,-2\\text{ mm}} = t = 0.0005$\n- Mismatch at $-1$, $-2$, and $-3$: $e_{-1,-2,-3\\text{ mm}} \\leq w = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$\n\nWe will now evaluate each design.\n\n**A.

On an unmethylated template, there are two outcomes for this site:\n1.  **Conversion succeeds**: Probability is $1-p = 0.99$. This creates a mismatch at position $-1$. As there are no other specified mismatches, this corresponds to a single $3'$ mismatch. The extension probability is $e_{3'\\text{-mm}} = r = 0.02$.\n2.  **Conversion fails**: Probability is $p = 0.01$. The template base remains Cytosine, resulting in a perfect match at the $3'$ end. The extension probability is $e_{\\text{match}} = 1$.\n\nThe expected false-positive extension probability, $F_A$, is calculated as:\n$$F_A = (1-p) \\cdot r + p \\cdot e_{\\text{match}}$$\n$$F_A = (0.99)(0.02) + (0.01)(1) = 0.0198 + 0.01 = 0.0298$$\nWe check this against the criterion $F < 0.005$.

Internal CpG discrimination: no CpGs at positions $-1$ or $-2$**\n\nThis primer design places the discriminating CpG site at an internal position (e.g., $-7$) and ensures the last $3$ bases of the primer match the bisulfite-converted unmethylated template sequence. This means the primer's $3'$ end is always perfectly matched to the unmethylated template, regardless of the conversion outcome at the internal CpG site. According to the provided rules, if the primer's last bases match perfectly, the extension probability is $e_{\\text{match}} = 1$. The state of an internal base pair does not alter this, based on the given model. Therefore, the false-positive extension probability is fixed.\n$$F_C = e_{\\text{match}} = 1$$\nWe check this against the criterion $F < 0.005$. Since $1$ is not less than $0.005$, this design fails catastrophically.\n\n**C: Incorrect.** This design is completely non-specific according to the model, leading to maximum false-positive amplification.\n\n**D.
