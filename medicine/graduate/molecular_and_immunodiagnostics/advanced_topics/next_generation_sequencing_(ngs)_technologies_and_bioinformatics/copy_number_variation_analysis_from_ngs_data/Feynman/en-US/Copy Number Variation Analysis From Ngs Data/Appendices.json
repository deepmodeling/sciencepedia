            "problem": "A clinical molecular and immunodiagnostics laboratory implements a read-depth based copy number variation analysis pipeline on targeted Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data for immune checkpoint genes. Assume the following foundational relationships:\n- In read-depth based copy number inference, the expected per-bin read count is proportional to the true copy number $c$ at that locus when library preparation and capture efficiency are uniform across samples.\n- A matched diploid reference sample has baseline ploidy $p$ and is processed identically. After normalization for library size and technical covariates, the expected fold-change in normalized coverage between a test locus and the diploid baseline is the ratio $c/p$.\n- The pipeline reports the log-transformed fold-change using base $2$ to quantify copy number shifts.\n\nUnder these assumptions, consider three biologically plausible copy number states for a tumor sample with baseline ploidy $p=2$: a hemizygous deletion with $c=1$, a single-copy gain with $c=3$, and a high-level focal amplification with $c=6$. Starting from the proportionality of read counts to copy number and the definition of a base-$2$ logarithm applied to the fold-change, derive the expected log-transformed fold-change for each state.

The core assumption—that normalized read depth is proportional to the underlying copy number—is the fundamental basis of this entire class of bioinformatics methods. The use of a diploid reference, log-2 transformation of fold-changes, and the modeling of read counts with Poisson or Negative Binomial distributions are all established, standard practices in computational genomics. The specified copy number states ($c=1, 3, 6$) are biologically plausible phenomena observed in cancer genomes.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and provides all necessary information to compute the requested values. The relationship between copy number ($c$), ploidy ($p$), and the final reported value (log-2 fold-change) is explicitly stated. The question regarding variance scaling requires a qualitative justification based on known statistical properties, which is a standard exercise in this field.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem defines the quantitative relationship between copy number and the reported diagnostic value. Let $L$ represent the log-transformed fold-change. According to the givens, this value is computed as the base-$2$ logarithm of the fold-change, which is the ratio of the test sample's copy number, $c$, to the reference sample's baseline ploidy, $p$.\n\nThe formula is therefore:\n$$L = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{c}{p}\\right)$$\nThe problem specifies that the reference is a diploid sample, meaning it has two copies of the chromosome in question. The baseline ploidy for the reference is thus $p=2$. The problem also states the tumor sample's baseline ploidy is $p=2$, which is consistent with the reference being a matched normal sample. The calculation for the log-fold-change uses the reference ploidy.\n\nWe are asked to calculate the expected value of $L$ for three distinct copy number states in the tumor sample:\n1.  **Hemizygous deletion:** The copy number is $c=1$.\n2.  **Single-copy gain:** The copy number is $c=3$.\n3.  **High-level focal amplification:** The copy number is $c=6$.\n\nFor each case, we substitute the values of $c$ and $p$ into the formula.\n\nCase 1: Hemizygous deletion ($c=1$)\n$$L_1 = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\log_2(2^{-1}) = -1$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $-1.000$.\n\nCase 2: Single-copy gain ($c=3$)\n$$L_2 = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = \\log_2(1.5)$$\nUsing the change of base formula for logarithms, $\\log_b(x) = \\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\ln(b)}$:\n$$L_2 = \\frac{\\ln(1.5)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{0.405465}{0.693147} \\approx 0.5849625$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.5850$.\n\nCase 3: High-level focal amplification ($c=6$)\n$$L_3 = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{6}{2}\\right) = \\log_2(3)$$\n$$L_3 = \\frac{\\ln(3)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{1.098612}{0.693147} \\approx 1.5849625$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $1.585$.\n\nNext, we address the justification for how the variance of the log-transformed fold-change scales with sequencing depth. Let $N_T$ and $N_R$ be the normalized read counts for the test and reference samples in a given genomic bin, respectively. These are random variables. The log-ratio is $L = \\log_2(N_T/N_R)$. The variance of $L$ can be approximated using the formula for propagation of uncertainty (the Delta method). First, we convert to the natural logarithm for convenience, since $\\log_2(x) = \\ln(x)/\\ln(2)$, and thus $\\text{Var}(\\log_2(x)) = \\frac{1}{(\\ln 2)^2}\\text{Var}(\\ln(x))$.\n\nFor a function $f(N_T, N_R) = \\ln(N_T) - \\ln(N_R)$, assuming $N_T$ and $N_R$ are independent (a standard assumption for separately sequenced samples), the variance is:\n$$\\text{Var}(L) \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\ln 2)^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N_T}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(N_T) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N_R}\\right)^2 \\text{Var}(N_R) \\right]$$\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the means $\\mu_T = \\mathbb{E}[N_T]$ and $\\mu_R = \\mathbb{E}[N_R]$, are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N_T} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_T}$ and $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial N_R} = -\\frac{1}{\\mu_R}$.\nSubstituting these gives:\n$$\\text{Var}(L) \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\ln 2)^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\text{Var}(N_T)}{\\mu_T^2} + \\frac{\\text{Var}(N_R)}{\\mu_R^2} \\right]$$\nThis shows that the variance of the log-ratio depends on the squared coefficient of variation (CV) of the read counts. The mean read count, $\\mu$, is directly proportional to the sequencing depth, $D$. Let's analyze the term $\\text{Var}(N)/\\mu^2$ under the suggested count models.\n\nAssumption 1: **Poisson Model.** For NGS counts, a simple model is the Poisson distribution, where $\\text{Var}(N) = \\mu$. In this case, the squared CV is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Var}(N)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu}$$\nSince $\\mu$ is proportional to sequencing depth $D$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\propto \\frac{1}{D}$. Therefore, for a Poisson model, $\\text{Var}(L) \\propto \\frac{1}{D_T} + \\frac{1}{D_R}$. If both samples have comparable depth $D$, then $\\text{Var}(L) \\propto \\frac{1}{D}$. The variance scales inversely with sequencing depth.\n\nAssumption 2: **Negative Binomial (NB) Model.** Real NGS data often exhibit overdispersion, where the variance is greater than the mean. The NB model captures this with a dispersion parameter $\\alpha$, such that $\\text{Var}(N) = \\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2$. The squared CV is:\n$$\\frac{\\text{Var}(N)}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{\\mu + \\alpha\\mu^2}{\\mu^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} + \\alpha$$\nAgain, since $\\mu \\propto D$, this term is proportional to $\\frac{1}{D} + \\alpha$. The variance of the log-ratio thus behaves as $\\text{Var}(L) \\propto (\\frac{1}{D_T} + \\alpha_T) + (\\frac{1}{D_R} + \\alpha_R)$. As depth $D$ increases, the $\\frac{1}{D}$ term diminishes, but the variance approaches a non-zero floor determined by the dispersion parameters ($\\alpha_T + \\alpha_R$).\n\nIn both plausible models, the variance of the log-transformed fold-change decreases as sequencing depth increases. Higher depth leads to more precise and reliable copy number estimates. The NB model more realistically predicts that even at very high depth, some variance remains due to biological and technical factors other than pure counting (shot) noise. The fundamental scaling relationship is that variance is inversely related to depth.",

It is scientifically grounded in the standard theoretical model for inferring copy number variation from bulk next-generation sequencing data, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. There are no identifiable flaws related to scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the log-ratio signal expression**\n\nLet $D$ denote the normalized read depth and $C$ denote the absolute DNA copy number of a genomic segment.\nFrom principle (i), the read depth is proportional to the copy number. We can express this relationship with a proportionality constant, $k$:\n$$D = kC$$\nFor the matched normal control sample, the cells are assumed to be diploid (or of a general baseline ploidy $p$), so the absolute copy number is $C_{normal} = p$. The corresponding normalized read depth is:\n$$D_{normal} = kp$$\nFor the tumor specimen, which is a mixture of cells, the overall read depth is determined by the average absolute copy number across the cell population. According to principle (ii), the specimen is composed of a fraction $\\pi$ of tumor cells and a fraction $(1-\\pi)$ of non-tumor (normal) cells. The tumor cells have a clonal copy state $c_t$, and the normal cells have a copy number $p$. The average absolute copy number in the tumor specimen, $C_{tumor\\_mix}$, is the weighted average of the copy numbers of the constituent cell types:\n$$C_{tumor\\_mix} = \\pi \\cdot c_t + (1-\\pi) \\cdot p$$\nConsequently, the expected normalized read depth for the tumor specimen is:\n$$D_{tumor\\_mix} = k \\cdot C_{tumor\\_mix} = k(\\pi c_t + (1-\\pi)p)$$\nThe log-ratio signal, $r$, is defined as the base-$2$ logarithm of the ratio of tumor coverage to normal coverage. Substituting the expressions for $D_{tumor\\_mix}$ and $D_{normal}$:\n$$r = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{D_{tumor\\_mix}}{D_{normal}}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{k(\\pi c_t + (1-\\pi)p)}{kp}\\right)$$\nThe proportionality constant $k$, which depends on sequencing technology and library preparation, is cancelled out in the ratio. This cancellation is fundamental to the robustness of log-ratio based CNV analysis. The final closed-form expression for $r$ is:\n$$r = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\pi c_t + (1-\\pi)p}{p}\\right)$$\nThis can be rearranged slightly to highlight the deviation from the baseline:\n$$r = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\pi c_t + p - \\pi p}{p}\\right) = \\log_2\\left(1 + \\frac{\\pi(c_t - p)}{p}\\right)$$\n\n**Task 2: Application to compute tumor purity**\n\nThe problem provides data for two segments from an assay with a baseline ploidy $p=2$. We are asked to compute a single tumor purity $\\pi$ consistent with the data from both segments.\n\nThe derived expression is $r = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{\\pi c_t + (1-\\pi)p}{p}\\right)$.

For a copy-neutral state where $C_s(b)=p_s(c)$ and $C_r(b)=p_r(c)$, the argument of the logarithm becomes $1$, and $E[L_{\\mathrm{corr}}(b)]$ becomes $0$, as required.",
