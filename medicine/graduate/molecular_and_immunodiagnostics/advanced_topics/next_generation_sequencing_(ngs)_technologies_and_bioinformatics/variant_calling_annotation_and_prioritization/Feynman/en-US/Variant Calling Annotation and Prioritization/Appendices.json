This exercise introduces the Phred quality score, the universal language for expressing confidence in each individual base call produced by a sequencer. By mastering the logarithmic relationship between the quality score $Q$ and the error probability $p$, you will gain a fundamental intuition for data quality assessment, which is the critical first step in any variant analysis pipeline.",

            "problem": "In high-throughput sequencing used in molecular and immunodiagnostics, base calls are reported with a Phred quality score that encodes the posterior probability of an incorrect base call, which is essential for variant calling, annotation, and prioritization. Provide a precise definition of the Phred quality score as a logarithmic transformation of the base-call error probability, and, starting from this definition, derive the explicit mapping from the reported base quality $Q$ to the corresponding error probability $p$. Then, evaluate $p$ for $Q=30$ and $Q=20$. Express each $p$ as an exact base-$10$ decimal without rounding.",
            "solution": "The Phred quality score, denoted by $Q$, provides a quantitative measure of the quality of a base call in sequencing data. It is defined as the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the posterior probability, $p$, that the corresponding base call is incorrect. The mathematical definition is:\n$$Q = -10 \\log_{10}(p)$$\nThe negative sign ensures that a lower error probability $p$ corresponds to a higher quality score $Q$. The factor of $10$ scales the score into a convenient integer range.\n\nTo derive the explicit mapping from the quality score $Q$ to the error probability $p$, we must algebraically solve the defining equation for $p$.\nStarting with the definition:\n$$Q = -10 \\log_{10}(p)$$\nFirst, we isolate the logarithmic term by dividing both sides of the equation by $-10$:\n$$-\\frac{Q}{10} = \\log_{10}(p)$$\nNext, to eliminate the base-$10$ logarithm, we apply its inverse function, which is the base-$10$ exponential function. We raise $10$ to the power of each side of the equation:\n$$10^{\\left(-\\frac{Q}{10}\\right)} = 10^{\\log_{10}(p)}$$\nBy the definition of a logarithm and its inverse, $10^{\\log_{10}(p)} = p$. Therefore, we arrive at the explicit mapping from $Q$ to $p$:\n$$p = 10^{-\\frac{Q}{10}}$$\nThis equation allows for the direct calculation of the base-call error probability $p$ from a given Phred quality score $Q$.\n\nWe now use this derived formula to evaluate $p$ for the specified values of $Q$.\n\nFor a Phred quality score of $Q=30$:\nWe substitute $Q=30$ into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = 10^{-\\frac{30}{10}}$$\n$$p = 10^{-3}$$\nAs an exact base-$10$ decimal, this is:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{10^3} = \\frac{1}{1000} = 0.001$$\nThis corresponds to a $1$ in $1000$ chance of an incorrect base call, or a base-call accuracy of $99.9\\%$.\n\nFor a Phred quality score of $Q=20$:\nWe substitute $Q=20$ into the equation for $p$:\n$$p = 10^{-\\frac{20}{10}}$$\n$$p = 10^{-2}$$\nAs an exact base-$10$ decimal, this is:\n$$p = \\frac{1}{10^2} = \\frac{1}{100} = 0.01$$\nThis corresponds to a $1$ in $100$ chance of an incorrect base call, or a base-call accuracy of $99\\%$.\n\nThe evaluated probabilities for $Q=30$ and $Q=20$ are $0.001$ and $0.01$, respectively.",

            "problem": "A rare missense variant in a cytokine receptor gene implicated in primary immunodeficiency is being evaluated for pathogenicity using molecular and immunodiagnostic evidence. A gene- and variant-class–specific baseline prior probability of pathogenicity is available from historical curation: the prior probability is $P_{0} = 0.02$. Independent lines of evidence have been gathered and calibrated to quantitative likelihood ratios, each defined as $LR = \\frac{P(\\text{evidence} \\mid \\text{pathogenic})}{P(\\text{evidence} \\mid \\text{benign})}$. The available evidence and their calibrated likelihood ratios are:\n- Familial co-segregation analysis across three generations yields a Bayes factor for segregation $BF_{\\text{seg}} = 5.0$, to be treated as a likelihood ratio $LR_{\\text{seg}} = 5.0$.\n- Case-control enrichment in affected cohorts versus controls yields $LR_{\\text{case}} = 8.5$.\n- A functional cell-based assay shows signaling activity reduced to $15\\%$ of wild-type, and the assay calibration maps this result to $LR_{\\text{func}} = 12.0$.\n- Population constraint analysis indicates the variant’s observed allele frequency is somewhat higher than expected for a fully penetrant disorder; this maps to a benign-supporting likelihood ratio $LR_{\\text{pop}} = 0.2$.\n- An ensemble computational prediction calibrated against gold-standard variant sets yields $LR_{\\text{comp}} = 3.2$.\n\nAssume that, conditional on the true pathogenicity state, these evidence components are independent and multiplicative in the odds framework.
