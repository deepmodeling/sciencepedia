The ligation uses pre-annealed Y-shaped adapters, where one adapter molecule ligates to one insert end. The average molar mass of a base pair in double-stranded DNA is $660$ g mol$^{-1}$ per base pair. You are supplied with $15$ pmol of adapters for this ligation.\n\nStarting from fundamental stoichiometry and the definition that moles equal mass divided by molar mass, compute the current adapter-to-insert-end molar ratio.

It is based on fundamental principles of stoichiometry as applied to a standard molecular biology procedure, Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) library preparation. All provided data are realistic and sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the molar quantities of DNA fragments and their ends, and then using these quantities to determine adapter-to-insert molar ratios. The fundamental relationship between mass ($m$), moles ($n$), and molar mass ($M$) is given by:\n$$ n = \\frac{m}{M} $$\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of moles of DNA insert fragments present in the sample. To do this, we first calculate the average molar mass of a single double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) fragment ($M_{fragment}$).\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Mass of dsDNA, $m_{DNA} = 50$ ng\n- Average length of dsDNA fragments, $L = 350$ bp\n- Average molar mass of a dsDNA base pair, $M_{bp} = 660 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\text{ bp}^{-1}$\n\nThe molar mass of a single fragment is the product of its length in base pairs and the molar mass per base pair:\n$$ M_{fragment} = L \\times M_{bp} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ M_{fragment} = 350 \\text{ bp} \\times 660 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{bp}} = 231000 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{mol}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of DNA fragments ($n_{DNA}$) in the sample. The mass of the DNA must be converted from nanograms (ng) to grams (g) for consistency with the units of molar mass ($1 \\text{ ng} = 10^{-9} \\text{ g}$).\n$$ m_{DNA} = 50 \\text{ ng} = 50 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ g} $$\n$$ n_{DNA} = \\frac{m_{DNA}}{M_{fragment}} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ g}}{231000 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}} \\approx 2.1645 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ mol} $$\n\nEach dsDNA fragment has two ends available for ligation (a $5'$ and $3'$ end on each strand, but for adapter ligation purposes, we consider the two termini of the double-stranded molecule). Therefore, the total number of moles of insert ends ($n_{ends}$) is twice the number of moles of DNA fragments.\n$$ n_{ends} = 2 \\times n_{DNA} $$\n$$ n_{ends} = 2 \\times \\frac{m_{DNA}}{L \\times M_{bp}} = 2 \\times \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ g}}{350 \\text{ bp} \\times 660 \\text{ g mol}^{-1} \\text{ bp}^{-1}} \\approx 4.3290 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ mol} $$\n\nFor convenience in molecular biology calculations, molar amounts are often expressed in picomoles (pmol), where $1 \\text{ mol} = 10^{12} \\text{ pmol}$.\n$$ n_{ends} \\approx 4.3290 \\times 10^{-13} \\text{ mol} \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{12} \\text{ pmol}}{1 \\text{ mol}}\\right) \\approx 0.43290 \\text{ pmol} $$\n\nThe first task is to compute the current adapter-to-insert-end molar ratio ($R_{current}$) using the supplied amount of adapters, $n_{adapters, supplied} = 15$ pmol.\n$$ R_{current} = \\frac{n_{adapters, supplied}}{n_{ends}} = \\frac{15 \\text{ pmol}}{0.43290 \\text{ pmol}} \\approx 34.65 $$\nThis ratio is high, which justifies the decision to adjust it to reduce adapter-dimer formation.\n\nThe second task is to determine the required amount of adapters ($n_{adapters, target}$) to achieve a target adapter-to-insert-end molar ratio of $R_{target} = 5.0$.\n$$ R_{target} = \\frac{n_{adapters, target}}{n_{ends}} $$\nRearranging to solve for $n_{adapters, target}$:\n$$ n_{adapters, target} = R_{target} \\times n_{ends} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ n_{adapters, target} = 5.0 \\times 0.43290 \\text{ pmol} \\approx 2.1645 \\text{ pmol} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ n_{adapters, target} \\approx 2.16 \\text{ pmol} $$\nThis is the recommended amount of adapters to achieve the target ligation efficiency while minimizing unwanted side products.",

The final library will consist of double-stranded molecules with an average total length of $300$ base pairs. The researcher intends to amplify an adapter-ligated cfDNA input of mass $2$ nanograms to achieve a final library concentration of $10$ nanomolar in a total volume of $50$ microliters.\n\nUse the following foundational facts:\n- The molar mass of double-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) is approximately $660$ grams per mole per base pair.\n- Moles equal mass divided by molar mass.\n- In an ideal Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), each cycle doubles the number of double-stranded molecules; with a per-cycle efficiency factor $\\eta$ (where $0 < \\eta \\leq 1$) defined as the fraction of ideal doubling, the per-cycle fold-amplification factor is $2\\eta$.
