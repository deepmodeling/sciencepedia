The workflow is as follows: a volume of plasma is processed by an RNA extraction kit, the RNA is eluted, an aliquot of the eluate is subjected to reverse transcription to complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA), and a fraction of the cDNA reaction is used as input to qPCR. A cDNA spike-in standard curve is run in the same qPCR plate to calibrate the amplification efficiency and the detection threshold. All steps are performed in the linear dynamic range and under conditions where contamination and non-specific amplification are negligible.\n\nYou are provided with the following experimentally measured and validated parameters:\n\n- Plasma input volume processed: $V_{\\text{plasma}} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- RNA extraction recovery fraction: $r_{\\text{ext}} = 0.50$.\n- RNA elution volume: $V_{e} = 40\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\n- Eluate volume used for reverse transcription: $v_{\\text{RT,in}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\n- Reverse transcription total reaction volume: $V_{\\text{RT,tot}} = 25\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\n- Reverse transcription efficiency (fraction of input RNA molecules that become amplifiable cDNA molecules): $r_{\\text{RT}} = 0.65$.\n- cDNA volume used per qPCR reaction well: $v_{\\text{qPCR,in}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\n- Target biomarker qPCR quantification cycle: $\\mathrm{Cq}_{\\text{target}} = 29.40$.\n\nThe cDNA spike-in calibration curve consists of two points with known initial molecules per reaction and measured quantification cycles:\n\n- Calibrator $1$: $N_{0,1} = 2.00 \\times 10^{5}$ molecules, $\\mathrm{Cq}_{1} = 21.00$.\n- Calibrator $2$: $N_{0,2} = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules, $\\mathrm{Cq}_{2} = 24.40$.\n\nAssume the qPCR amplification per cycle is exponential with a constant per-cycle amplification factor $(1+E)$, where $E$ is the amplification efficiency, and that the fluorescence detection threshold corresponds to a constant number of amplicon molecules across wells.

All parameters required for a unique solution are provided, and they are within realistic ranges for a molecular diagnostics assay. The problem is a standard, albeit multi-step, quantitative calculation in molecular biology. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe objective is to determine the concentration of the target RNA in the original plasma sample, denoted as $C_{\\text{plasma}}$, in units of copies per milliliter. The solution proceeds in three main parts: first, we establish the calibration parameters for the qPCR assay; second, we use these parameters to determine the number of target cDNA molecules in a single qPCR reaction; and third, we back-calculate from this number to the initial concentration in plasma, accounting for all intermediate steps.\n\n**Part 1: qPCR Calibration**\n\nThe number of amplicon molecules, $N_C$, after $C$ cycles of PCR is modeled by the exponential growth equation:\n$$N_C = N_0 (1+E)^C$$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of template molecules and $E$ is the amplification efficiency per cycle. The quantification cycle, $\\mathrm{Cq}$, is the cycle at which the fluorescence signal crosses a fixed threshold, corresponding to a constant number of molecules, $N_T$. Thus, for any sample:\n$$N_T = N_0 (1+E)^{\\mathrm{Cq}}$$\nTaking the base-$10$ logarithm of this equation yields a linear relationship between $\\mathrm{Cq}$ and $\\log_{10}(N_0)$:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_T) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\mathrm{Cq} \\cdot \\log_{10}(1+E)$$\nRearranging for $\\mathrm{Cq}$:\n$$\\mathrm{Cq} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(1+E)} - \\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1+E)} \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\mathrm{Cq} = k - m \\log_{10}(N_0)$, where the slope $m$ is a function of the efficiency. We can determine this slope using the two provided calibrator points:\n- Calibrator $1$: $N_{0,1} = 2.00 \\times 10^{5}$ molecules, $\\mathrm{Cq}_{1} = 21.00$.\n- Calibrator $2$: $N_{0,2} = 2.00 \\times 10^{4}$ molecules, $\\mathrm{Cq}_{2} = 24.40$.\n\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as:\n$$m = \\frac{\\Delta(\\mathrm{Cq})}{\\Delta(-\\log_{10}(N_0))} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cq}_{2} - \\mathrm{Cq}_{1}}{\\log_{10}(N_{0,1}) - \\log_{10}(N_{0,2})} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Cq}_{2} - \\mathrm{Cq}_{1}}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_{0,1}}{N_{0,2}}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$m = \\frac{24.40 - 21.00}{\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{2.00 \\times 10^{5}}{2.00 \\times 10^{4}}\\right)} = \\frac{3.40}{\\log_{10}(10)} = \\frac{3.40}{1} = 3.40$$\n\n**Part 2: Quantification of Target cDNA Molecules**\n\nLet $N_{0,\\text{target}}$ be the number of target cDNA molecules in the qPCR well for the unknown sample, which had a quantification cycle $\\mathrm{Cq}_{\\text{target}} = 29.40$.

We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the initial number of template copies, $N_{0}$, and the cycle threshold, $C_{t}$. The amount of amplicon after $c$ cycles, $N(c)$, is given by the exponential amplification principle:\n$$N(c) = N_{0} (1+E)^{c}$$\nwhere $E$ is the per-cycle amplification efficiency. The cycle threshold $C_{t}$ is defined as the cycle number at which the amplicon amount reaches a fixed threshold, $T$.\n$$T = N(C_{t}) = N_{0} (1+E)^{C_{t}}$$\nTo compare two different reactions, A and B, with initial template quantities $N_{0,A}$ and $N_{0,B}$ and measured cycle thresholds $C_{t,A}$ and $C_{t,B}$, respectively, we can write:\n$$T = N_{0,A} (1+E)^{C_{t,A}}$$\n$$T = N_{0,B} (1+E)^{C_{t,B}}$$\nSince the efficiency $E$ and threshold $T$ are identical for all assays, we can equate these expressions:\n$$N_{0,A} (1+E)^{C_{t,A}} = N_{0,B} (1+E)^{C_{t,B}}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the ratio of initial template quantities:\n$$\\frac{N_{0,A}}{N_{0,B}} = (1+E)^{C_{t,B} - C_{t,A}}$$\nThis relationship is the fundamental tool for all subsequent calculations.\n\n**1. Calculation of the residual DNA fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{DNA}}$**\n\nLet $N_{0,+}$ be the total initial template molecules in the qPCR for the RT-positive target assay. Let $N_{0,-}$ be the initial template molecules in the qPCR for the no-RT control target assay.

We must convert these values to compatible units (grams and liters, then adjust for milliliters).\n\nThe free hemoglobin concentration is:\n$$H_{free} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} = 20 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{dL}} \\times \\frac{10^{-3} \\text{ g}}{1 \\text{ mg}} \\times \\frac{10 \\text{ dL}}{1 \\text{ L}} = 0.2 \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{L}}$$\nThe mean corpuscular hemoglobin is:\n$$MCH = 29 \\frac{\\text{pg}}{\\text{RBC}} = 29 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{RBC}}$$\n\nThe number density of lysed RBCs per liter is the total free hemoglobin mass per liter divided by the hemoglobin mass per cell:\n$$n'_{RBC,lysed} = \\frac{H_{free}}{MCH} = \\frac{0.2 \\text{ g/L}}{29 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ g/RBC}} = \\frac{0.2}{29} \\times 10^{12} \\frac{\\text{RBC}}{\\text{L}}$$\nTo find the number of lysed RBCs per milliliter ($n_{RBC,lysed}$), we divide by $1000$ mL/L:\n$$n_{RBC,lysed} = \\frac{n'_{RBC,lysed}}{1000} = \\frac{0.2 \\times 10^{12}}{29 \\times 1000} \\frac{\\text{RBC}}{\\text{mL}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{29} \\frac{\\text{RBC}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate molecule counts from lysis in $1$ mL of plasma**\n\nThe number of total small RNA molecules released into $1$ mL of plasma from lysis, $N_{RNA,lysis}$, is the number of lysed RBCs in that volume multiplied by the number of small RNAs released per RBC:\n$$N_{RNA,lysis} = n_{RBC,lysed} \\times R_{RBC} = \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^8}{29}\\right) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^4) = \\frac{10 \\times 10^{12}}{29} = \\frac{10^{13}}{29} \\text{ molecules}$$\nThe number of miR-451a molecules from lysis, $N_{miR,lysis}$, is this total multiplied by the fraction of miR-451a in RBCs:\n$$N_{miR,lysis} = N_{RNA,lysis} \\times f_{miR,RBC} = \\frac{10^{13}}{29} \\times 0.60 = \\frac{6 \\times 10^{12}}{29} \\text{ molecules}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate pre-lysis molecule counts in $1$ mL of plasma**\n\nThe pre-lysis (true) number of total small RNA molecules in $1$ mL of plasma is given by the concentration:\n$$N_{RNA,true} = C_{RNA,true} \\times 1 \\text{ mL} = 1.0 \\times 10^{10} \\text{ molecules}$$\nThe pre-lysis number of miR-451a molecules is:\n$$N_{miR,true} = N_{RNA,true} \\times f_{miR,true} = (1.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\times 0.020 = 2.0 \\times 10^8 \\text{ molecules}$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the observed fraction of miR-451a**\n\nNow we find the total observed molecule counts by adding the pre-lysis amounts and the contributions from lysis:\n$$N_{RNA,obs} = N_{RNA,true} + N_{RNA,lysis} = 1.0 \\times 10^{10} + \\frac{10^{13}}{29} = 10^{10} \\left(1 + \\frac{1000}{29}\\right) = 10^{10} \\left(\\frac{1029}{29}\\right)$$\n$$N_{miR,obs} = N_{miR,true} + N_{miR,lysis} = 2.0 \\times 10^8 + \\frac{6 \\times 10^{12}}{29} = 10^8 \\left(2 + \\frac{60000}{29}\\right) = 10^8 \\left(\\frac{58 + 60000}{29}\\right) = \\frac{60058 \\times 10^8}{29}$$\nThe observed fraction, $f_{miR,obs}$, is the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$f_{miR,obs} = \\frac{N_{miR,obs}}{N_{RNA,obs}} = \\frac{\\frac{60058 \\times 10^8}{29}}{\\frac{1029 \\times 10^{10}}{29}} = \\frac{60058 \\times 10^8}{1029 \\times 10^{10}} = \\frac{60058}{102900}$$\nNumerically, $f_{miR,obs} \\approx 0.58365$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the bias**\n\nFinally, we compute the bias $B$ using its definition:\n$$B = \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_{miR,obs}}{f_{miR,true}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{60058/102900}{0.020}\\right)$$\n$$B = \\ln\\left(\\frac{60058}{102900 \\times 0.020}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{60058}{2058}\\right)$$\nEvaluating the expression:\n$$B \\approx \\ln(29.18270165) \\approx 3.373516$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain $B \\approx 3.374$.",
