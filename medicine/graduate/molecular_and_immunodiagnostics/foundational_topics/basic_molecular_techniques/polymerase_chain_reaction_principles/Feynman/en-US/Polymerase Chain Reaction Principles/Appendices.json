            "solution": "The problem is to determine the dilution factor required to prepare a specific DNA standard from a stock solution. This involves calculating the number of DNA molecules in a given mass and then using this to find the concentration of the stock solution in molecules per unit volume.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Length of the plasmid, $L = 3\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 3000$ base pairs (bp).\n- Molar mass of double-stranded DNA per base pair, $M_{bp} = 660\\,\\mathrm{g/mol/bp}$.\n- Avogadro's constant, $N_{A} = 6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}}$.\n- Mass of plasmid for calculation, $m = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\n- Stock solution concentration by mass, $C_{stock, mass} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n- Target concentration for the highest standard, $C_{target} = 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{copies}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the molar mass, $M$, of a single covalently closed circular plasmid. The molar mass is the product of the plasmid length in base pairs and the molar mass per base pair.\n$$M = L \\times M_{bp}$$\n$$M = 3000\\,\\mathrm{bp} \\times 660\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol} \\cdot \\mathrm{bp}} = 1,980,000\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}} = 1.98 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{g}}{\\mathrm{mol}}$$\n\nNext, we address part (1) of the problem: to derive the number of plasmid molecules, $N$, in a mass of $m = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ng}$. First, the mass must be converted to grams to be consistent with the units of molar mass.\n$$m = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{g}$$\nThe number of moles, $n$, is the mass divided by the molar mass:\n$$n = \\frac{m}{M} = \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1.98 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}}$$\nThe number of molecules, $N$, is the number of moles multiplied by Avogadro's constant, $N_{A}$:\n$$N = n \\times N_{A} = \\frac{m}{M} \\times N_{A}$$\n$$N = \\left( \\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1.98 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}} \\right) \\times (6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol^{-1}})$$\n$$N = \\frac{1.00 \\times 6.022}{1.98} \\times 10^{(-9 - 6 + 23)} \\text{ molecules}$$\n$$N \\approx 3.041414 \\times 10^{8} \\text{ molecules (or copies)}$$\n\nFor part (2), we infer the stock concentration in copies per $\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.

In qPCR, the fluorescence threshold is crossed after a certain number of cycles, the quantification cycle $Cq$, when the amplified product exceeds a fixed threshold amount. Assume per-cycle exponential amplification in qPCR, meaning that the quantity after $n$ cycles is $N(n) = N_0 (1+E)^{n}$, where $N_0$ is the initial target quantity and $E$ is the per-cycle fractional amplification efficiency.

Round both $E$ and $N_0$ to four significant figures. Express $E$ as a decimal fraction, and express $N_0$ in arbitrary units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the per-cycle amplification efficiency, $E$, and the initial quantity of a target nucleic acid, $N_0$, using data from a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) experiment. The solution will proceed by first deriving the theoretical relationship between the quantification cycle ($Cq$) and the initial target quantity ($N_0$) from the provided exponential amplification model. Then, by comparing this theoretical relationship to the empirically determined linear regression equation, we can solve for the unknown parameters.\n\nThe problem states that the amplification process follows the exponential model:\n$$N(n) = N_0 (1 + E)^n$$\nwhere $N(n)$ is the quantity of the amplified product after $n$ cycles, $N_0$ is the initial quantity of the target, and $E$ is the per-cycle fractional amplification efficiency. An efficiency of $E=1$ corresponds to a perfect doubling of the product in each cycle (i.e., $100\\%$ efficiency).\n\nThe quantification cycle, $Cq$, is defined as the cycle number at which the amount of amplified product, $N(n)$, crosses a predetermined fluorescence threshold. This threshold corresponds to a fixed quantity of product, which we will denote as $N_T$. Therefore, at $n = Cq$, we have $N(Cq) = N_T$. Substituting this into the amplification model gives:\n$$N_T = N_0 (1 + E)^{Cq}$$\n\nTo derive the relationship used for the standard curve, we need to express $Cq$ as a function of $\\log_{10}(N_0)$. We begin by taking the base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_T) = \\log_{10}(N_0 (1 + E)^{Cq})$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, specifically $\\log(ab) = \\log(a) + \\log(b)$ and $\\log(a^c) = c \\log(a)$, we can expand the right side:\n$$\\log_{10}(N_T) = \\log_{10}(N_0) + Cq \\cdot \\log_{10}(1 + E)$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to solve for $Cq$:\n$$Cq \\cdot \\log_{10}(1 + E) = \\log_{10}(N_T) - \\log_{10}(N_0)$$\n$$Cq = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T) - \\log_{10}(N_0)}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)}$$\n$$Cq = \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)} \\right) \\log_{10}(N_0) + \\left( \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)} \\right)$$\n\nThis equation has the form of a linear equation, $y = mx + b$, where $y = Cq$ and $x = \\log_{10}(N_0)$. By comparison, we can identify the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$ of the standard curve:\n$$m = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)}$$\n$$b = \\frac{\\log_{10}(N_T)}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)}$$\n\nThe problem provides the results of a linear regression for a specific assay: a slope of $m = -3.4$ and an intercept of $b = 38.0$. We can now use the slope to determine the amplification efficiency $E$.\n$$-3.4 = -\\frac{1}{\\log_{10}(1 + E)}$$\n$$\\log_{10}(1 + E) = \\frac{1}{3.4}$$\nTo solve for $E$, we first convert from a logarithmic to an exponential form:\n$$1 + E = 10^{(1/3.4)}$$\n$$E = 10^{(1/3.4)} - 1$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$E \\approx 10^{0.2941176...} - 1$$\n$$E \\approx 1.96843... - 1 = 0.96843...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the amplification efficiency is:\n$$E \\approx 0.9684$$\n\nNext, we need to determine the initial quantity $N_0$ for an unknown sample with a measured $Cq$ of $29$. We use the full equation of the standard curve, which is given by the slope and intercept:\n$$Cq = -3.4 \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) + 38.0$$\nWe are given $Cq = 29$ for the unknown sample. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$29 = -3.4 \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) + 38.0$$\nNow, we solve for $\\log_{10}(N_0)$:\n$$3.4 \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) = 38.0 - 29$$\n$$3.4 \\cdot \\log_{10}(N_0) = 9.0$$\n$$\\log_{10}(N_0) = \\frac{9.0}{3.4}$$\nTo find $N_0$, we again convert from logarithmic to exponential form:\n$$N_0 = 10^{(9.0/3.4)}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$N_0 \\approx 10^{2.6470588...}$$\n$$N_0 \\approx 443.66...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the initial quantity is:\n$$N_0 \\approx 443.7$$\nThis value is in arbitrary units, consistent with the units of the standards used to generate the curve.\n\nThus, the per-cycle amplification efficiency $E$ is approximately $0.9684$, and the initial quantity $N_0$ of the unknown sample is approximately $443.7$ arbitrary units.",
