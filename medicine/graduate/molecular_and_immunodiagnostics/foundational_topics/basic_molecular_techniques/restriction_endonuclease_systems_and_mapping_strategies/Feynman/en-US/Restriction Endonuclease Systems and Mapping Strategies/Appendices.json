            "problem": "A linear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule of length $10$ kilobases (kb) contains exactly three recognition sites for a single restriction endonuclease X. The molecule is uniquely end-labeled at its left terminus. A partial digestion is performed under conditions in which the probability that any given recognition site is cut on any given molecule is low and independent across sites and molecules. After electrophoresis and autoradiography for the labeled fragments, the observed labeled bands have sizes (in kb) given by the set $\\{2,5,8,10\\}$. Assume that band calling is exact, the gel resolves single-base differences, and there is no comigration of distinct fragments.\n\nUse only fundamental principles of restriction mapping for linear DNA under partial digestion with an end-labeled probe to infer the ordered positions of the three X recognition sites along the molecule, measured from the labeled left end. Let the molecule length be $L=10$ and the ordered site positions be $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ with $0<x_1<x_2<x_3<L$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n**Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- DNA molecule: linear\n- Total length: $L = 10$ kilobases (kb)\n- Number of restriction sites for endonuclease X: $3$\n- Labeling: uniquely end-labeled at its left terminus\n- Digestion: partial\n- Cutting properties: low probability, independent across sites\n- Detection: electrophoresis and autoradiography of labeled fragments\n- Observed labeled band sizes: $\\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$ in kb\n- Assumptions: exact band calling, single-base resolution, no comigration\n- Objective: Determine the ordered positions $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ of the three sites, where $0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < L$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic restriction mapping experiment using partial digestion and end-labeling. This is a fundamental and well-established technique in molecular biology. The principles invoked are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a set of experimental results (band sizes) and asks for the deduction of the underlying physical map (restriction site locations). The provided data is specific and the constraints (ordering of sites) are clear.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective terminology standard to the field of molecular biology. The data is purely quantitative.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The core of the validation is to check if the provided data is consistent and sufficient.\n  - The molecule is linear with length $L=10$ kb.\n  - It is labeled at one end (the left terminus, defined as position $0$).\n  - A partial digest will generate a series of labeled fragments. Since the label is only at the left end, all detected fragments must start at position $0$.\n  - These fragments will terminate either at a cut site or at the far end of the molecule (if uncut).\n  - Let the three restriction sites be at positions $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ from the labeled end. The expected set of labeled fragments will have lengths corresponding to these positions, plus the length of the full, uncut molecule.\n  - Thus, the theoretical set of observed band sizes is $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\}$.\n  - The experimentally observed set of band sizes is given as $\\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$.\n  - Equating these two sets, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\} = \\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$.\n  - Given $L=10$ kb, the $10$ kb band in the data corresponds to the full-length, uncut molecule. This is consistent.\n  - The remaining band sizes, $\\{2, 5, 8\\}$, must correspond to the set of restriction site positions, $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\}$.\n  - The ordering constraint $0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < L$ can be satisfied by assigning $x_1=2$, $x_2=5$, and $x_3=8$, which gives $0 < 2 < 5 < 8 < 10$.\n  - The problem is therefore self-contained, internally consistent, and possesses a unique solution based on the provided information.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains sufficient, consistent information for a unique solution.\n- **Action**: Proceed with a detailed solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the positions of three restriction sites for an endonuclease X on a linear DNA molecule. The method employed is partial digestion followed by analysis of end-labeled fragments.\n\nLet the linear DNA molecule be represented by a coordinate system starting at $0$ at the labeled left terminus and ending at position $L$ at the right terminus. We are given that the total length of the molecule is $L=10$ kb.\n\nThere are exactly three recognition sites for the restriction enzyme X. Let their ordered positions from the left end be $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$. According to the problem statement, these positions must satisfy the condition:\n$$0 < x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < L$$\n\nThe DNA is uniquely end-labeled at its left terminus (position $0$). A partial digestion is performed, which means that on any given molecule, the enzyme may cut at none, one, two, or all three of the available sites. Since the probability of cutting is low and independent at each site, a population of DNA molecules will yield a mixture of different cleavage products.\n\nAfter digestion, the fragments are separated by gel electrophoresis, and only the fragments containing the label from the left terminus are visualized by autoradiography. The size of a labeled fragment is equal to the distance from the labeled end (position $0$) to the point of cleavage.\n\nThe possible labeled fragments are generated as follows:\n1.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the first site, $x_1$. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_1$, and its length is $x_1$.\n2.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the second site, $x_2$, provided the first site at $x_1$ was not cut on that same molecule. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_2$, and its length is $x_2$.\n3.  A fragment is produced by a cut at the third site, $x_3$, provided the sites at $x_1$ and $x_2$ were not cut on that same molecule. This fragment extends from position $0$ to $x_3$, and its length is $x_3$.\n4.  If a molecule is not cut at any of the three sites, the full-length molecule remains. This molecule is labeled at its end and will be detected as a fragment of length $L$.\n\nTherefore, the set of all possible sizes for the labeled fragments is $\\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that electrophoresis and autoradiography revealed a set of labeled bands with sizes (in kb) given by $\\{2, 5, 8, 10\\}$. This experimental result must correspond to the theoretical set of fragment sizes.\n$$ \\{x_1, x_2, x_3, L\\} = \\{2, 5, 8, 10\\} $$\n\nWe are given that the total length of the DNA is $L=10$ kb. This accounts for the largest observed band of $10$ kb, which represents the uncut DNA molecules.\nBy removing $L=10$ from both sets, we are left with the correspondence for the restriction site positions:\n$$ \\{x_1, x_2, x_3\\} = \\{2, 5, 8\\} $$\n\nThe problem imposes a strict ordering on the positions of the sites: $x_1 < x_2 < x_3$. To satisfy this condition, we must assign the values from the set $\\{2, 5, 8\\}$ in ascending order:\n- $x_1$ must be the smallest value, so $x_1 = 2$ kb.\n- $x_2$ must be the middle value, so $x_2 = 5$ kb.\n- $x_3$ must be the largest value, so $x_3 = 8$ kb.\n\nWe verify this solution against the ordering constraint: $0 < 2 < 5 < 8 < 10$. The condition holds.\nThus, the ordered positions of the three restriction sites are $2$ kb, $5$ kb, and $8$ kb from the labeled left end.\n\nThe final answer is required as a single ordered row matrix $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$.\nThe positions are $(2, 5, 8)$ in units of kilobases.",

The specified enzyme properties are realistic and analogous to common, well-characterized enzymes (e.g., $E_A$ resembles EcoRI, $E_B$ resembles XhoI). The buffer compositions, enzyme concentrations, reaction conditions, and inhibition profiles are all scientifically plausible and represent a typical real-world scenario of buffer incompatibility. The problem is firmly grounded in established molecular biology principles.\n\n- **Well-Posed and Objective:** The problem is well-posed, asking for the optimal protocol from a given set of choices based on a comprehensive list of constraints. The question is objective, and the provided data is sufficient to quantitatively evaluate each option and arrive at a single best answer. The language is precise and technical.\n\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The provided information is self-consistent. Let's verify the numbers.\n    - DNA volume needed: $\\frac{2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = \\frac{2500\\,\\mathrm{ng}}{100\\,\\mathrm{ng}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - Enzyme units needed: $2.5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g} \\times 10\\,\\mathrm{U}/\\mu\\mathrm{g} = 25\\,\\mathrm{U}$.\n    - Enzyme volume needed: $\\frac{25\\,\\mathrm{U}}{20\\,\\mathrm{U}/\\mu\\mathrm{L}} = 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.\n    - Glycerol contribution per enzyme addition in a $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ reaction: The enzyme adds $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of a $50\\%$ glycerol stock. The volume of glycerol is $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 0.50 = 0.625\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$.

This value is well below the specified $\\leq 5\\%$ limit, so star activity from glycerol is not a primary concern with this setup.\nThe data are complete and free of contradictions.\n\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem is realistic, solvable, and not trivial. It requires a systematic application of the given biophysical constraints.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires two stages: first, calculating the expected fragment sizes from a correct double digest, and second, evaluating each proposed protocol against the given biochemical constraints.\n\n**1. Calculation of Expected Fragment Sizes**\n\nThe plasmid is a circular DNA molecule with a total length of $L = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$. The restriction sites are given as clockwise distances from the origin: $C_A = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ for enzyme $E_A$ and $C_B = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ for enzyme $E_B$. A double digest will cleave the circle at both sites, generating two fragments.\n\n- The length of the first fragment is the distance along the circle between the two sites in one direction. Traveling clockwise from $E_A$ to $E_B$, the length is:\n$$ \\text{Fragment}_1 = C_B - C_A = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\n\n- The length of the second fragment is the remaining part of the circle, calculated by taking the total length and subtracting the first fragment's length:\n$$ \\text{Fragment}_2 = L - \\text{Fragment}_1 = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} $$\n\nAlternatively, this can be calculated as the distance from $E_B$ clockwise back to $E_A$, which is $(L - C_B) + C_A = (7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb} - 6.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}) + 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 1.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\nThe sum of the fragments is $5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} + 2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb} = 7.2\\,\\mathrm{kb}$, which correctly equals the total plasmid length. A successful double digest must yield fragments of $5.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$ and $2.1\\,\\mathrm{kb}$.\n\n**2. Analysis of Protocol Options**\n\nThe critical issue is the incompatibility of the buffers. Enzyme $E_A$ requires low salt (Buffer $A$: $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) and is inhibited by high $\\mathrm{KCl}$ concentrations ($[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$). Enzyme $E_B$ requires high salt (Buffer $B$: $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$) and is inhibited by $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ ($[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\geq 30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$).\n\n**Option A Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_A$**: This step is performed in Buffer $A$, which is optimal for $E_A$. This is valid.\n2.  **Add Buffer $B$ components, heat-inactivate $E_A$, add $E_B$**: This part of the protocol has two fatal flaws.\n    -   **Flaw 1 (Heat Inactivation):** The problem explicitly states that $E_A$ is **not reliably heat-inactivated**. Attempting to do so is improper procedure and will likely leave active $E_A$ in the reaction.\n    -   **Flaw 2 (Enzyme Inhibition):** After the first digestion in a $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ volume containing Buffer $A$ ($50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$), the protocol adds components for the second digest. The volume of the first reaction mixture is $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. Let's conservatively ignore the volume of added buffer and enzyme for a moment. The $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ solution contains a total of $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$. When the second reaction is set up, this $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ remains. The concentration of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ will be diluted slightly but will remain high. Let's calculate it accurately. The second reaction volume will be $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ (from step 1) + $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($10\\times$ Buffer $B$) + $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($E_B$) = $56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The final concentration of $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ carried over from Buffer $A$ is: $[\\mathrm{NaCl}]_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{50\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 44.4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    -   Since $E_B$ is strongly inhibited by $[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\geq 30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, and the final concentration would be approximately $44.4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $E_B$ would be severely inhibited, leading to partial or no digestion.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The protocol relies on a non-functional heat inactivation step and creates buffer conditions that inhibit the second enzyme, $E_B$.\n\n**Option B Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_B$**: This step is performed in Buffer $B$ ($100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$), which is optimal for $E_B$. This is valid.\n2.  **Heat-inactivate $E_B$**: The problem states $E_B$ can be fully heat-inactivated at $80^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for $20\\,\\mathrm{min}$. This step is correct and effective.\n3.  **Add Buffer $A$ components and add $E_A$**: After heat inactivation, the reaction tube still contains all the components of Buffer $B$, most notably $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$. Let's calculate the final $\\mathrm{KCl}$ concentration. The new reaction volume is $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ (from step 1) + $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($10\\times$ Buffer $A$) + $1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ ($E_A$) = $56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The final concentration of $\\mathrm{KCl}$ carried over from Buffer $B$ is: $[\\mathrm{KCl}]_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mM} \\times 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}}{56.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}} \\approx 88.9\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    -   Enzyme $E_A$ is inhibited by $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. Since the final concentration would be approximately $88.9\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $E_A$ activity would be severely compromised.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. Although the heat inactivation step is correct, the protocol fails to address the buffer incompatibility, leading to inhibition of the second enzyme, $E_A$.\n\n**Option C Analysis:**\n1.  **Digest with $E_B$**: Performed in Buffer $B$, this step is valid.\n2.  **Heat-inactivate $E_B$**: This step is valid and represents good practice, though it is technically redundant given the next step.\n3.  **Spin-column purification**: This is the crucial step. The problem states that purification removes enzymes, salts (to $< 1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ monovalent cations), and glycerol. This procedure effectively cleans the digested DNA from the inhibitory components of Buffer $B$ (i.e., $100\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$).\n4.  **Second digest with $E_A$**: The purified DNA is eluted into $45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of water. Then, $5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ of $10\\times$ Buffer $A$ is added. This reconstitutes the DNA in $1\\times$ Buffer $A$. The final buffer for the second digest is now Buffer $A$, containing $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ and negligible $\\mathrm{KCl}$ ($< 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ after dilution), which is the optimal condition for $E_A$.\n    - The final volume would be $45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} + 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} + 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} = 51.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}$. The concentration of Buffer $A$ would be $5/51.25 \\approx 0.976\\times$, which is a negligible deviation.\n    - The final monovalent cation concentration is $\\approx 0.976 \\times 50\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 48.8\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, which is well above the $20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ threshold for $E_A$ star activity.\n    - Glycerol from the second enzyme addition would be $(0.50 \\times 1.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L}) / 51.25\\,\\mu\\mathrm{L} \\times 100\\% \\approx 1.22\\%$, which is well below the $5\\%$ limit.\nThis protocol correctly identifies and resolves the buffer incompatibility by using an intermediate purification step.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**. This is the only protocol that rigorously adheres to all specified constraints, ensuring both enzymes function under their optimal conditions, leading to a complete and specific double digest.\n\n**Option D Analysis:**\n1.  **Simultaneous double digest**: This approach attempts to use both enzymes at the same time in a single \"compromise\" buffer.\n2.  **Buffer Composition**: A common method for creating a compromise buffer is to aim for final salt concentrations that are an average of the two optimal buffers. Assuming the target is an average of the $1\\times$ buffer compositions, the final reaction would have $[\\mathrm{NaCl}] \\approx 25\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ and $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\approx 50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n3.  **Enzyme Activity**:\n    - For $E_A$: The buffer contains $50\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{KCl}$. Since $E_A$ is inhibited by $[\\mathrm{KCl}] \\geq 40\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, its activity will be significantly reduced, likely leading to incomplete digestion at the $E_A$ site.\n    - For $E_B$: The buffer contains $25\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ $\\mathrm{NaCl}$. This is below the inhibitory threshold of $30\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, so $E_B$ might retain reasonable activity.\n    - However, since a complete *double* digest is required, the failure of even one enzyme renders the protocol invalid.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**. A simultaneous digest is not feasible because a compromise buffer cannot be formulated that supports the activity of both enzymes; specifically, the KCl concentration required for $E_B$ is inhibitory to $E_A$.",

            "problem": "A Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) at a single-copy locus is being used to verify Mendelian segregation in a family trio by Southern blot. Restriction endonucleases cleave double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at specific recognition sites, producing fragments whose lengths depend on the positions of those sites. In an RFLP, allelic variation creates gain or loss of a restriction site, altering the length of the restriction fragment that hybridizes to a locus-specific probe. On a Southern blot, only fragments that contain sequence complementary to the probe will be visible.\n\nConsider a genomic interval with two invariant EcoRI sites at positions $0$ kilobases (kb) and $14.0$ kb, measured from a defined $5'$ reference. A locus-specific probe hybridizes uniquely to the interval from $9.0$ kb to $10.5$ kb. Allele $\\mathcal{A}$ has no additional EcoRI sites between $0$ kb and $14.0$ kb. Allele $\\mathcal{B}$ has one additional EcoRI site at $6.2$ kb; all other EcoRI sites in the interval are invariant. Assume complete digestion, single-copy locus, no star activity, and high-stringency hybridization so that only fragments containing the full probe region are detected.\n\nA trio has the following genotypes at this RFLP: the father is heterozygous $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$, the mother is homozygous $\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}$, and the child inherits one allele from each parent according to Mendelian segregation with no transmission distortion. Using fundamental principles of restriction mapping and Mendelian inheritance, determine:\n- The fragment lengths (in kb) expected to be detected by the probe in the father, the mother, and the child under EcoRI digestion.\n- The probability (as a decimal fraction) that the child displays two bands on the Southern blot under these conditions.\n\nReport your final result as a row matrix in the ordered tuple $\\left(F_{s},\\,F_{l},\\,M,\\,C_{s},\\,C_{l},\\,p_{2}\\right)$, where $F_{s}<F_{l}$ are the father’s band lengths (in kb), $M$ is the mother’s band length (in kb), $C_{s}<C_{l}$ are the child’s band lengths (in kb) in the two-band scenario (leave entries corresponding to absent bands out of the tuple; do not insert placeholders), and $p_{2}$ is the probability that the child shows two bands. Express all lengths in kilobases. No rounding is required; provide exact values.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular genetics, specifically restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and Mendelian inheritance. The problem is well-posed, objective, and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution without internal contradictions or ambiguity.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first determining the restriction fragment patterns for each allele, then determining the expected Southern blot results for each individual based on their genotype, and finally calculating the Mendelian probabilities for the child's possible genotypes and corresponding blot patterns.\n\nLet the genomic coordinates be measured in kilobases (kb). The invariant EcoRI restriction sites are at positions $0$ kb and $14.0$ kb. The locus-specific probe hybridizes to the segment from $9.0$ kb to $10.5$ kb.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Allele $\\mathcal{A}$**\n    Allele $\\mathcal{A}$ has EcoRI sites only at the invariant positions $0$ kb and $14.0$ kb. Digestion with EcoRI will therefore produce a single fragment spanning the interval $[0, 14.0]$. The length of this fragment is $14.0 - 0 = 14.0$ kb.\n    The probe hybridizes to the region $[9.0, 10.5]$. Since this region is fully contained within the $[0, 14.0]$ interval, this $14.0$ kb fragment will be detected by the probe on a Southern blot.\n    Thus, allele $\\mathcal{A}$ is associated with a detected fragment of length $14.0$ kb.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Allele $\\mathcal{B}$**\n    Allele $\\mathcal{B}$ has an additional EcoRI site at position $6.2$ kb, in addition to the invariant sites at $0$ kb and $14.0$ kb. Digestion with EcoRI will cleave the DNA at positions $0$, $6.2$, and $14.0$. This produces two fragments:\n    -   Fragment 1: Spanning the interval $[0, 6.2]$. Its length is $6.2 - 0 = 6.2$ kb.\n    -   Fragment 2: Spanning the interval $[6.2, 14.0]$. Its length is $14.0 - 6.2 = 7.8$ kb.\n    The probe hybridizes to the region $[9.0, 10.5]$. We must determine which fragment contains the probe sequence.\n    -   The probe interval $[9.0, 10.5]$ is not within the first fragment's interval $[0, 6.2]$.\n    -   The probe interval $[9.0, 10.5]$ is fully contained within the second fragment's interval $[6.2, 14.0]$.\n    Therefore, only the $7.8$ kb fragment will be detected by the probe.\n    Thus, allele $\\mathcal{B}$ is associated with a detected fragment of length $7.8$ kb.\n\n3.  **Determination of Parental Banding Patterns**\n    -   **Father:** The father's genotype is heterozygous, $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$. He possesses both allele $\\mathcal{A}$ and allele $\\mathcal{B}$. Consequently, the Southern blot will detect the fragments corresponding to both alleles. The expected bands will have lengths of $14.0$ kb (from $\\mathcal{A}$) and $7.8$ kb (from $\\mathcal{B}$). The problem defines $F_{s}$ and $F_{l}$ as the father's smaller and larger band lengths, respectively. Therefore, $F_{s} = 7.8$ kb and $F_{l} = 14.0$ kb.\n    -   **Mother:** The mother's genotype is homozygous, $\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}$. She possesses only allele $\\mathcal{B}$. The Southern blot will detect only the fragment corresponding to allele $\\mathcal{B}$. The expected band will have a length of $7.8$ kb. Therefore, $M = 7.8$ kb.\n\n4.  **Determination of Child's Genotype and Banding Pattern**\n    According to Mendelian inheritance, the child inherits one allele from each parent.\n    -   The father (genotype $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$) can transmit allele $\\mathcal{A}$ with a probability of $P(\\mathcal{A}) = 0.5$ or allele $\\mathcal{B}$ with a probability of $P(\\mathcal{B}) = 0.5$.\n    -   The mother (genotype $\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}$) can only transmit allele $\\mathcal{B}$, with a probability of $P(\\mathcal{B}) = 1.0$.\n\n    The possible genotypes for the child are determined by combining the parental gametes:\n    -   **Scenario 1:** The child inherits $\\mathcal{A}$ from the father and $\\mathcal{B}$ from the mother. The child's genotype is $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$. The probability of this event is $P(\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}) = P(\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{from father}}) \\times P(\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{from mother}}) = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5$. A child with genotype $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$ will show two bands, at $7.8$ kb and $14.0$ kb.\n    -   **Scenario 2:** The child inherits $\\mathcal{B}$ from the father and $\\mathcal{B}$ from the mother. The child's genotype is $\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}$. The probability of this event is $P(\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}) = P(\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{from father}}) \\times P(\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{from mother}}) = 0.5 \\times 1.0 = 0.5$. A child with genotype $\\mathcal{B}\\mathcal{B}$ will show a single band at $7.8$ kb.\n\n5.  **Final Calculations**\n    The problem asks for several values to be reported in a specific tuple format.\n    -   The father's band lengths are $F_{s} = 7.8$ and $F_{l} = 14.0$.\n    -   The mother's band length is $M = 7.8$.\n    -   The question asks for the child's band lengths, $C_{s}$ and $C_{l}$, in the specific case where the child displays two bands. This corresponds to the child having genotype $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$. In this case, the band lengths are $7.8$ kb and $14.0$ kb. Thus, $C_{s} = 7.8$ and $C_{l} = 14.0$.\n    -   The probability that the child displays two bands, $p_{2}$, is the probability of the child having the $\\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{B}$ genotype, which we calculated as $0.5$. So, $p_{2} = 0.5$.\n\nThe final ordered tuple $\\left(F_{s},\\,F_{l},\\,M,\\,C_{s},\\,C_{l},\\,p_{2}\\right)$ is therefore $\\left(7.8,\\,14.0,\\,7.8,\\,7.8,\\,14.0,\\,0.5\\right)$.",
