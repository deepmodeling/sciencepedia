The high GC-content ($80\\%$) of this specific sequence is the primary driver of its large negative enthalpy and, consequently, its high stability.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the specific temperature at which the dissociation rate of a mismatched DNA duplex is a factor of $10$ greater than that of its perfectly matched counterpart. This analysis is grounded in the principles of Transition State Theory (TST) and chemical thermodynamics.\n\nFirst, we formalize the dissociation rate constants for the perfect match (pm) and the single mismatch (mm) duplexes using the provided Eyring equation:\n$k_{\\mathrm{off}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}}{R T}\\right)$.\n\nLet $k_{\\mathrm{off, pm}}$ be the dissociation rate constant for the perfect match duplex and $k_{\\mathrm{off, mm}}$ be the rate constant for the mismatched duplex.

At a uniform absolute temperature $T$, the expressions for the rate constants are:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off, pm}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{pm}}}{R T}\\right)$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{off, mm}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right) \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\ddagger}_{\\mathrm{mm}}}{R T}\\right)$$\nHere, the pre-exponential factor $\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{h}\\right)$ is identical for both processes as it depends only on constants and the common temperature $T$.\n\nThe problem states a critical relationship derived from the assumption that the mismatch primarily destabilizes the bound state, while the transition state energy remains approximately unchanged. This implies that the difference in the activation energy for dissociation is equal to the difference in the Gibbs free energy of the bound states. The problem defines this difference as $\\Delta \\Delta G \\equiv \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{mm}} - \\Delta G_{\\mathrm{pm}}$. Specifically, the activation barrier for the less stable mismatched duplex is lower.
