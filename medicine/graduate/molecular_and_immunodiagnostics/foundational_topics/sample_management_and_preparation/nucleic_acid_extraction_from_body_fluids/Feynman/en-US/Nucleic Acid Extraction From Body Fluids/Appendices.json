            "problem": "A clinical laboratory is validating a silica spin-column workflow for isolating cell-free DNA from human plasma for downstream quantitative PCR (qPCR). A plasma specimen of volume $2.50\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ contains a uniform DNA concentration of $12.0\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$. The workflow consists of four serial unit operations: binding to silica under chaotropic conditions, wash $1$ with a high-salt buffer, wash $2$ with an ethanol-containing buffer, and elution with a low-salt buffer.\n\nAssume the following experimentally determined, step-specific, fragment-averaged efficiencies under the stated conditions:\n- Binding captures a fraction $E_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0.88$ of the input DNA onto the silica.\n- Wash $1$ retains a fraction $R_{\\mathrm{w1}} = 0.93$ of the DNA that is on the silica immediately prior to wash $1$.\n- Wash $2$ retains a fraction $R_{\\mathrm{w2}} = 0.98$ of the DNA that is on the silica immediately prior to wash $2$.\n- Elution releases a fraction $E_{\\mathrm{e}} = 0.62$ of the DNA that remains bound immediately prior to elution.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n- Conservation of mass across each step: if $M_{i}$ is the DNA mass entering step $i$ and the step retains or transfers a fraction $f_{i}$ of $M_{i}$ to the next pool, then the DNA mass proceeding to the next pool is $f_{i} M_{i}$ and the step loss is $(1 - f_{i}) M_{i}$.\n- Independence of serial step efficiencies under controlled buffer conditions, such that the net recovery over multiple steps is the product of individual step transfer fractions.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular diagnostics and mass conservation, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep analysis of a DNA extraction workflow. Let us define the given parameters symbolically:\n- Initial plasma volume: $V_{\\mathrm{p}} = 2.50\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Initial DNA concentration: $C_{0} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$\n- Binding capture fraction: $E_{\\mathrm{b}} = 0.88$\n- Wash $1$ retention fraction: $R_{\\mathrm{w1}} = 0.93$\n- Wash $2$ retention fraction: $R_{\\mathrm{w2}} = 0.98$\n- Elution release fraction: $E_{\\mathrm{e}} = 0.62$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total initial mass of DNA, $M_0$, in the plasma sample.\n$$M_0 = V_{\\mathrm{p}} \\times C_{0} = (2.50\\,\\mathrm{mL}) \\times (12.0\\,\\mathrm{ng}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}) = 30.0\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\nThe analysis will proceed by tracking the mass of DNA retained on the silica column after each step.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of expressions for recovered mass and cumulative loss**\n\nLet $M_i$ be the mass of DNA on the silica column after step $i$. The initial mass available for binding is $M_0$.\n\n1.  **Binding Step:** A fraction $E_{\\mathrm{b}}$ of the initial mass $M_0$ is captured. The mass bound to the silica is $M_1$.\n    $$M_1 = E_{\\mathrm{b}} M_0$$\n\n2.  **Wash 1 Step:** This step removes impurities. A fraction $R_{\\mathrm{w1}}$ of the DNA already bound, $M_1$, is retained. The mass on the silica after wash $1$ is $M_2$.\n    $$M_2 = R_{\\mathrm{w1}} M_1 = R_{\\mathrm{w1}} E_{\\mathrm{b}} M_0$$\n\n3.  **Wash 2 Step:** This step removes residual salts. A fraction $R_{\\mathrm{w2}}$ of the DNA, $M_2$, is retained. The mass on the silica after wash $2$ is $M_3$.\n    $$M_3 = R_{\\mathrm{w2}} M_2 = R_{\\mathrm{w2}} R_{\\mathrm{w1}} E_{\\mathrm{b}} M_0$$\n\n4.  **Elution Step:** A fraction $E_{\\mathrm{e}}$ of the DNA remaining on the column, $M_3$, is released into the eluate. This constitutes the recovered mass, $M_{\\mathrm{rec}}$.\n    $$M_{\\mathrm{rec}} = E_{\\mathrm{e}} M_3$$\n    Substituting the expression for $M_3$, we derive the expression for the overall recovered DNA mass:\n    $$M_{\\mathrm{rec}} = E_{\\mathrm{e}} R_{\\mathrm{w2}} R_{\\mathrm{w1}} E_{\\mathrm{b}} M_0$$\n\nThe cumulative loss, $L_{\\mathrm{cum}}$, is the difference between the initial mass and the recovered mass, based on the principle of conservation of mass.\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cum}} = M_0 - M_{\\mathrm{rec}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $M_{\\mathrm{rec}}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{cum}} = M_0 - (E_{\\mathrm{e}} R_{\\mathrm{w2}} R_{\\mathrm{w1}} E_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_0 = (1 - E_{\\mathrm{e}} R_{\\mathrm{w2}} R_{\\mathrm{w1}} E_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_0$$\n\n**Task 2: Computation of absolute mass loss at each step and identification of the dominant limiter**\n\nWe compute the absolute DNA mass lost at each individual step. Let $L_i$ be the loss at step $i$.\n\n1.  **Binding Loss ($L_1$):** This is the DNA that fails to bind and is discarded in the flow-through. The mass available is $M_0$.\n    $$L_1 = (1 - E_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_0 = (1 - 0.88) \\times 30.0\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 0.12 \\times 30.0\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\n2.  **Wash 1 Loss ($L_2$):** This is the DNA prematurely stripped from the silica during the first wash. The mass on the column before this step is $M_1 = E_{\\mathrm{b}} M_0 = 0.88 \\times 30.0\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 26.4\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\n    $$L_2 = (1 - R_{\\mathrm{w1}}) M_1 = (1 - 0.93) \\times 26.4\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 0.07 \\times 26.4\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 1.848\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\n3.  **Wash 2 Loss ($L_3$):** This is the DNA stripped during the second wash. The mass on the column before this step is $M_2 = R_{\\mathrm{w1}} M_1 = 0.93 \\times 26.4\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 24.552\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\n    $$L_3 = (1 - R_{\\mathrm{w2}}) M_2 = (1 - 0.98) \\times 24.552\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 0.02 \\times 24.552\\,\\mathrm{ng} \\approx 0.491\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\n4.  **Elution Loss ($L_4$):** This is the DNA that remains irreversibly bound to the silica and is not recovered in the eluate. The mass on the column before this step is $M_3 = R_{\\mathrm{w2}} M_2 = 0.98 \\times 24.552\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 24.06096\\,\\mathrm{ng}$.\n    $$L_4 = (1 - E_{\\mathrm{e}}) M_3 = (1 - 0.62) \\times 24.06096\\,\\mathrm{ng} = 0.38 \\times 24.06096\\,\\mathrm{ng} \\approx 9.143\\,\\mathrm{ng}$$\n\nComparing the absolute mass losses:\n- $L_1 = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{ng}$\n- $L_2 = 1.848\\,\\mathrm{ng}$\n- $L_3 = 0.491\\,\\mathrm{ng}$\n- $L_4 = 9.143\\,\\mathrm{ng}$\n\nThe largest absolute mass loss occurs at the elution step ($L_4$). Therefore, the elution step is the dominant limiter of recovery for this plasma extraction protocol.\n\n**Task 3: Calculation of the cumulative DNA loss as a decimal fraction**\n\nThe problem asks for the cumulative loss as a decimal fraction, which is the ratio of the total mass lost to the initial mass, $\\frac{L_{\\mathrm{cum}}}{M_0}$. This is equivalent to one minus the overall recovery efficiency, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{loss}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{cum}}}{M_0} = 1 - \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{rec}}}{M_0} = 1 - \\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}}$$\nThe overall recovery efficiency is the product of the individual step transfer fractions:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}} = E_{\\mathrm{b}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{w1}} \\times R_{\\mathrm{w2}} \\times E_{\\mathrm{e}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}} = 0.88 \\times 0.93 \\times 0.98 \\times 0.62$$\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}} = 0.8184 \\times 0.98 \\times 0.62$$\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}} = 0.802032 \\times 0.62 = 0.49725984$$\nNow, we can calculate the cumulative loss fraction:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{loss}} = 1 - \\eta_{\\mathrm{overall}} = 1 - 0.49725984 = 0.50274016$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as required for the final answer gives:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{loss}} \\approx 0.5027$$\nThis signifies that approximately $50.27\\%$ of the initial DNA is lost during the extraction process.",

Consider cerebrospinal fluid extraction performed with silica columns after lysis in guanidinium-containing buffer. Eluted RNA carries residual guanidinium at concentration $[\\mathrm{GuSCN}]=20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, measured by conductivity.

The inhibitory potency of guanidinium for this RT under the reaction conditions has been characterized by a half-maximal inhibitory concentration $IC_{50,\\mathrm{RT}}=5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n\nYou must evaluate how residual guanidinium affects RT or polymerase performance and propose cleanup adjustments that measurably alleviate inhibition without fragment loss.

Add $1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ sodium chloride to the eluate to “neutralize” guanidinium; ionic strength increases, and no desalting is performed.

Silica-based nucleic acid extraction, the role of chaotropic salts as both binding agents and enzyme inhibitors, RT-qPCR, and the use of $IC_{50}$ to quantify inhibition are all established concepts. The values provided ($[\\mathrm{GuSCN}]=20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$, $IC_{50,\\mathrm{RT}}=5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$) are plausible. The relationship $\\Delta \\mathrm{Ct}\\approx \\log_2(F)$ is a correct and standard approximation for qPCR with high efficiency. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It defines a clear initial state, a set of specific interventions, and quantitative criteria for success. This structure allows for a unique determination of which interventions are successful.\n- **Objective (Critical)**: The problem is stated in objective, technical language. The criteria for success are quantitatively defined ($\\Delta \\mathrm{Ct}\\ge 1.0$ and specified fragment size ranges), leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The setup is self-contained and consistent. It provides a simplified but sufficient model for enzyme inhibition (noncompetitive, characterized by $IC_{50}$) and its effect on qPCR, which is appropriate for a problem of this nature. No essential information is missing.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The proposed laboratory procedures (extra washes, SEC, bead cleanup, dilution) and their stated outcomes (e.g., reduction in salt concentration, size-selective retention) are realistic and consistent with known behaviors of these techniques.\n- **No other flaws detected**: The problem does not exhibit any of the other listed flaws such as being non-formalizable, ill-posed, trivial, or outside scientific verifiability.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **VALID**. A detailed solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis rests on quantifying the change in RT efficiency due to guanidinium inhibition and its impact on the qPCR cycle threshold ($\\mathrm{Ct}$).\n\n**1. Modeling RT Inhibition and qPCR Outcome**\n\nBased on basis (i), guanidinium acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor. The fractional activity, $A$, of the reverse transcriptase at an inhibitor concentration $[I]$ is given by the standard dose-response equation:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[I]}{IC_{50}}}$$\nThe amount of cDNA synthesized in the RT step is directly proportional to this activity, $A$. According to basis (iv), the $\\mathrm{Ct}$ value in qPCR is related to the initial amount of template (in this case, cDNA) logarithmically.\n\nAn improvement (decrease) in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ between the initial condition (subscript 'initial') and a new condition (subscript 'new') is given by:\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\mathrm{Ct}_{\\text{initial}} - \\mathrm{Ct}_{\\text{new}} $$\nThis change is a function of the fold-change in the effective starting amount of template. The effective template amount is the product of the RT activity ($A$) and the input RNA amount ($N_{input}$).\n$$ \\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\log_2\\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{new}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{initial}}}\\right) $$\nThe goal is to find options where $\\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} \\ge 1.0$ and fragment preservation is met. This translates to the condition:\n$$ \\frac{A_{\\text{new}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{initial}}} \\ge 2^{1.0} = 2 $$\nThe total fold-improvement in effective template must be at least $2$.\n\n**2. Baseline (Initial) Condition**\n\n- Initial inhibitor concentration: $[I]_{\\text{initial}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- $IC_{50} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n- Initial fractional RT activity:\n$$A_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 4} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\nThe RT enzyme is operating at only $20\\%$ of its maximal capacity. For options A, B, C, and D, the input RNA amount is unchanged, so $N_{input, \\text{new}} = N_{input, \\text{initial}}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Proposed Adjustments**\n\n**A. Add one extra wash of $80\\%$ ethanol, incubate, and perform a dry spin.**\n- **Fragment Preservation**: The statement asserts this procedure \"leaves the fragment size distribution unchanged\". High ethanol concentration on-column prevents elution of nucleic acids, so both mRNA and miRNA are retained. This condition is **met**.\n- **Measurable Alleviation**:\n    - New inhibitor concentration: $[I]_{\\text{new}} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    - New fractional RT activity:\n    $$A_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{4\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.8} = \\frac{1}{1.8}$$\n    - Fold-improvement in effective template (since $N_{input}$ is constant):\n    $$\\frac{A_{\\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1/1.8}{1/5} = \\frac{5}{1.8} \\approx 2.778$$\n    - Since $2.778 \\ge 2$, the qPCR improvement criterion is met.\n    - The actual $\\mathrm{Ct}$ improvement is $\\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\log_2(2.778) \\approx 1.47$, which is $\\ge 1.0$.\n- **Verdict**: Both criteria are met. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**B. Add $1\\,\\mathrm{M}$ sodium chloride to the eluate.**\n- **Fragment Preservation**: No removal step is performed, so all nucleic acid fragments are preserved. This condition is **met**.\n- **Measurable Alleviation**: The proposal suggests that adding $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ will \"neutralize\" guanidinium. This is scientifically incorrect. Guanidinium's inhibitory chaotropic effect is not counteracted by another salt; in fact, high total ionic strength can be inhibitory itself. Based strictly on the provided model, the concentration of the inhibitor, $\\mathrm{GuSCN}$, remains $[I]_{\\text{new}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    - New fractional RT activity: $A_{\\text{new}} = A_{\\text{initial}} = 0.2$.\n    - Fold-improvement in effective template:\n    $$\\frac{A_{\\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2} = 1$$\n    - Since $1  2$, the qPCR improvement criterion is not met. The $\\mathrm{Ct}$ improvement is $\\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\log_2(1) = 0$.\n- **Verdict**: Fails to provide measurable alleviation. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Perform post-elution size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with a $5\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ cutoff.**\n- **Fragment Preservation**: The method is stated to retain nucleic acids of approximately 20 nt and larger.\n    - The molecular weight (MW) of a single-stranded RNA of length $L$ is approx. $L \\times 320\\,\\mathrm{Da}$.\n    - For the smallest target ($20\\,\\mathrm{nt}$ miRNA): $\\mathrm{MW} \\approx 20 \\times 320\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 6400\\,\\mathrm{Da} = 6.4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$.\n    - Since $6.4\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ is greater than the $5\\,\\mathrm{kDa}$ cutoff, the miRNA fragments will be retained, as will the much larger mRNA fragments. This condition is **met**.\n- **Measurable Alleviation**:\n    - New inhibitor concentration: $[I]_{\\text{new}}  0.5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. We use the worst-case value $[I]_{\\text{new}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ for calculation.\n    - New fractional RT activity:\n    $$A_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1} = \\frac{1}{1.1}$$\n    - Fold-improvement in effective template:\n    $$\\frac{A_{\\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}}} = \\frac{1/1.1}{1/5} = \\frac{5}{1.1} \\approx 4.545$$\n    - Since $4.545 \\ge 2$, the qPCR improvement criterion is met.\n    - The actual $\\mathrm{Ct}$ improvement is $\\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\log_2(4.545) \\approx 2.18$, which is $\\ge 1.0$.\n- **Verdict**: Both criteria are met. This option is **Correct**.\n\n**D. Use a magnetic bead cleanup with a binding ratio of $0.8\\times$.**\n- **Fragment Preservation**: This method is explicitly stated to `retain fragments >= 150 bp and exclude smaller fragments`.\n    - The mRNA targets ($200-500\\,\\mathrm{nt}$) are $\\ge 150\\,\\mathrm{nt}$ and will be retained.\n    - The miRNA targets ($20-25\\,\\mathrm{nt}$) are smaller than $150\\,\\mathrm{nt}$ and will be excluded.\n    - Therefore, this procedure results in the loss of the miRNA fraction. This condition is **not met**.\n- **Measurable Alleviation**: Although the inhibition would be alleviated (same salt reduction as in C), the option fails on the fragment preservation criterion.\n- **Verdict**: Fails to preserve all target nucleic acids. This option is **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Dilute the eluate $1:4$ with nuclease-free water.**\n- **Fragment Preservation**: Dilution does not remove any fragments from the solution. This condition is **met**.\n- **Measurable Alleviation**: This procedure affects both inhibitor concentration and the amount of input RNA.\n    - New inhibitor concentration: $[I]_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{4} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mM}$.\n    - Input nucleic acid change: $N_{input, \\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{4} N_{input, \\text{initial}}$.\n    - New fractional RT activity:\n    $$A_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}{5\\,\\mathrm{mM}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$$\n    - Total fold-improvement in effective template:\n    $$\\frac{A_{\\text{new}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}} \\cdot N_{input, \\text{initial}}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{new}}}{A_{\\text{initial}}} \\cdot \\frac{N_{input, \\text{new}}}{N_{input, \\text{initial}}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = 2.5 \\cdot 0.25 = 0.625$$\n    - Since $0.625  2$, the qPCR improvement criterion is not met. The four-fold loss of template concentration more than negates the $2.5$-fold gain in RT activity.\n    - The actual $\\mathrm{Ct}$ improvement is $\\Delta\\Delta\\mathrm{Ct} = \\log_2(0.625) \\approx -0.68$. This represents an *increase* in $\\mathrm{Ct}$ of about $0.68$ cycles, meaning the result gets worse.\n- **Verdict**: Fails to provide measurable alleviation. This option is **Incorrect**.",

The kit elutes in a fixed volume of $0.05$ mL, and the downstream assay consumes $0.02$ mL of that eluate per reaction. Assume recovery is unbiased with respect to mutant and wild-type alleles, and that the VAF is preserved through extraction and elution.\n\nUse the widely accepted conversion for human genomic DNA mass-to-copy number: one haploid genome equivalent (GE) has mass $3.3$ pg, so $1$ ng corresponds to $k = \\frac{10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{pg/ng}}{3.3\\ \\mathrm{pg/GE}} \\approx 303$ GE/ng. Model molecule loading into the assay as Poisson with mean $\\lambda$, and impose the requirement that the probability of zero mutant molecules is at most $0.05$. Derive from first principles the expression for the minimum plasma volume required to meet the assay’s input requirement given the elution volume constraint, and compute its value using the parameters above.\n\nExpress the final volume in milliliters and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the stated criteria.\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n-   Assay constraint: The probability of loading zero mutant molecules, $P(X_{\\text{mutant}}=0)$, must be no greater than $0.05$ under a Poisson sampling model.\n-   Plasma cfDNA concentration: $C_{\\text{plasma}} = 20$ ng/mL.\n-   ctDNA variant allele fraction: $f_{\\text{VAF}} = 0.001$.\n-   Extraction recovery efficiency: $\\eta_{\\text{rec}} = 0.60$.\n-   Elution volume: $V_{\\text{elute}} = 0.05$ mL.\n-   Assay input volume: $V_{\\text{assay}} = 0.02$ mL.\n-   Mass-to-copy number conversion factor: $1\\,\\mathrm{ng}$ of DNA corresponds to $k = \\frac{1000}{3.3}$ haploid genome equivalents (GE), so $k \\approx 303$ GE/ng.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\nThe problem is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of molecular diagnostics and statistics. The parameters provided are realistic for a clinical liquid biopsy application. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient information to derive a unique solution. It is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and subjective claims. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe derivation proceeds by establishing the required number of mutant molecules at the assay input and working backward to the initial plasma volume. All mathematical entities are rendered in LaTeX as required.\n\nLet $N_{\\text{mutant, assay}}$ be the random variable representing the number of mutant molecules loaded into the assay. This process is modeled by a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}$. The probability of observing $j$ molecules is given by:\n$$P(N_{\\text{mutant, assay}}=j) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}^{j} \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{assay}})}{j!}$$\n\nThe problem states the constraint that the probability of loading zero mutant molecules must be no greater than $0.05$:\n$$P(N_{\\text{mutant, assay}}=0) \\le 0.05$$\nFor a Poisson distribution, $P(j=0) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{assay}})$. Thus, the constraint becomes:\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}) \\le 0.05$$\nTo find the minimum required mean, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda_{\\text{assay}} \\le \\ln(0.05)$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{assay}} \\ge -\\ln(0.05)$$\nThis establishes the minimum required average number of mutant molecules in the volume loaded into the assay.\n\nNext, we relate this required mean, $\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}$, to the initial plasma volume, $V_{\\text{plasma}}$.\nLet $V_{\\text{plasma}}$ be the volume of plasma in mL. The total mass of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in this sample is:\n$$M_{\\text{cfDNA}} = C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}}$$\nUsing the conversion factor $k$, the total number of haploid genome equivalents (GE) in the plasma sample is:\n$$N_{\\text{GE, total}} = M_{\\text{cfDNA}} \\times k = C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k$$\nThe number of mutant molecules in the plasma sample, $N_{\\text{mutant, plasma}}$, is obtained by multiplying the total number of GEs by the variant allele fraction, $f_{\\text{VAF}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{mutant, plasma}} = N_{\\text{GE, total}} \\times f_{\\text{VAF}} = C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k \\times f_{\\text{VAF}}$$\nThe extraction process recovers a fraction $\\eta_{\\text{rec}}$ of these molecules into the eluate. The total number of mutant molecules in the eluate is:\n$$N_{\\text{mutant, eluate}} = N_{\\text{mutant, plasma}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{rec}} = C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k \\times f_{\\text{VAF}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{rec}}$$\nThese molecules are dissolved in the elution volume, $V_{\\text{elute}}$. Assuming uniform concentration, the concentration of mutant molecules in the eluate, $C'_{\\text{mutant, eluate}}$, is:\n$$C'_{\\text{mutant, eluate}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant, eluate}}}{V_{\\text{elute}}}$$\nThe downstream assay consumes a volume $V_{\\text{assay}}$ of this eluate. The average number of mutant molecules in this assay volume, $\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}$, is the product of the concentration and the assay volume:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{assay}} = C'_{\\text{mutant, eluate}} \\times V_{\\text{assay}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{mutant, eluate}}}{V_{\\text{elute}}} \\times V_{\\text{assay}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $N_{\\text{mutant, eluate}}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{assay}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k \\times f_{\\text{VAF}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{rec}}}{V_{\\text{elute}}} \\times V_{\\text{assay}}$$\nNow, we apply the Poisson-derived constraint on $\\lambda_{\\text{assay}}$:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times V_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k \\times f_{\\text{VAF}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{rec}} \\times V_{\\text{assay}}}{V_{\\text{elute}}} \\ge -\\ln(0.05)$$\nWe are asked to find the minimum plasma volume, $V_{\\text{plasma, min}}$, which corresponds to the equality:\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, min}} = \\frac{-V_{\\text{elute}} \\ln(0.05)}{C_{\\text{plasma}} \\times k \\times f_{\\text{VAF}} \\times \\eta_{\\text{rec}} \\times V_{\\text{assay}}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the minimum required plasma volume.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\nWe now substitute the given values into the expression:\n-   $V_{\\text{elute}} = 0.05$ mL\n-   $V_{\\text{assay}} = 0.02$ mL\n-   $C_{\\text{plasma}} = 20$ ng/mL\n-   $f_{\\text{VAF}} = 0.001$\n-   $\\eta_{\\text{rec}} = 0.60$\n-   $k = \\frac{1000}{3.3}$ GE/ng (counts per nanogram)\n-   $\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.99573$\n\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, min}} = \\frac{-(0.05) \\ln(0.05)}{20 \\times \\left(\\frac{1000}{3.3}\\right) \\times 0.001 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.02}$$\nLet's compute the denominator first:\n$$D = 20 \\times \\left(\\frac{1000}{3.3}\\right) \\times 0.001 \\times 0.60 \\times 0.02 = \\frac{20 \\times 1000 \\times 0.001 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.02}{3.3} = \\frac{20 \\times 1 \\times 0.012}{3.3} = \\frac{0.24}{3.3} = \\frac{24}{330} = \\frac{4}{55}$$\nThe numerator is:\n$$N = -0.05 \\ln(0.05)$$\nSo,\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, min}} = \\frac{-0.05 \\ln(0.05)}{4/55} = \\frac{-0.05 \\times 55}{4} \\ln(0.05) = -\\frac{2.75}{4} \\ln(0.05) = -0.6875 \\ln(0.05)$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(0.05) \\approx -2.99573227$, we have:\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, min}} \\approx -0.6875 \\times (-2.99573227) \\approx 2.059567185 \\text{ mL}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$V_{\\text{plasma, min}} \\approx 2.06 \\text{ mL}$$",
