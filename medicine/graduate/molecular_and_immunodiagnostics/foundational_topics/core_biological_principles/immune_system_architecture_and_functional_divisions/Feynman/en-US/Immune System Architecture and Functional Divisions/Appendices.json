A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first constructing a compartmental model based on mass-action kinetics, then solving for the steady state, and finally substituting the given numerical values.\n\n**1. Model Formulation**\nLet $C(t)$, $E(t)$, and $S(t)$ be the number of peptides in the cytosol, the number of peptides in the ER, and the number of peptide-MHC I complexes on the cell surface at time $t$, respectively. The system can be described by a set of three coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), where the rate of change of each species is the sum of its production fluxes minus the sum of its removal fluxes.\n\nThe rate of change of cytosolic peptides, $C$, is:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = J_g - v_{\\mathrm{TAP}}(C) - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C = J_g - \\frac{V_T C}{K_T + C} - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C $$\nHere, $J_g$ is the influx from proteasomal generation. The efflux terms are transport into the ER via TAP, $v_{\\mathrm{TAP}}(C)$, and first-order degradation with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n\nThe rate of change of ER peptides, $E$, is:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{TAP}}(C) - k_s E - k_{\\mathrm{de}} E = \\frac{V_T C}{K_T + C} - (k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}}) E $$\nThe influx is from TAP transport. The efflux terms are consumption for MHC I loading and export, with effective rate constant $k_s$, and degradation with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{de}}$.\n\nThe rate of change of surface complexes, $S$, is:\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = k_s E - k_{\\mathrm{turn}} S $$\nThe influx is from the successful loading and export from the ER. The problem states that one exported ER peptide yields one stable surface complex, so the rate of complex formation is equal to the rate of peptide consumption for export, $k_s E$. The efflux is due to surface turnover with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{turn}}$.\n\n**2. Steady-State Analysis**\nAt steady state, the concentrations of all species are constant, so the time derivatives are zero. Let the steady-state quantities be $C_{ss}$, $E_{ss}$, and $S_{ss}$.\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dE}{dt} = 0, \\quad \\frac{dS}{dt} = 0 $$\nThis yields the following system of algebraic equations:\n_1._  $J_g - \\dfrac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss} = 0$\n_2._  $\\dfrac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} - (k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}}) E_{ss} = 0$\n_3._  $k_s E_{ss} - k_{\\mathrm{turn}} S_{ss} = 0$\n\n**3. Symbolic Solution for $S_{ss}$**\nWe solve this system for $S_{ss}$.\nFrom equation (3), we express $S_{ss}$ in terms of $E_{ss}$:\n$$ S_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}} E_{ss} $$\nFrom equation (2), we express $E_{ss}$ in terms of $C_{ss}$:\n$$ E_{ss} = \\frac{1}{k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}}} \\frac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{ss}$:\n$$ S_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}(k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}})} \\frac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} $$\nThe term $\\frac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}}$ is the steady-state TAP flux, which we can call $J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss}$. From equation (1), we have:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss} = \\frac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} = J_g - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $S_{ss}$ gives:\n$$ S_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}(k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}})} (J_g - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss}) $$\nTo find $S_{ss}$, we must first solve for $C_{ss}$ from equation (1). Rearranging equation (1) gives:\n$$ J_g = \\frac{V_T C_{ss}}{K_T + C_{ss}} + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss} $$\nMultiplying by $(K_T + C_{ss})$ to clear the denominator:\n$$ J_g(K_T + C_{ss}) = V_T C_{ss} + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss}(K_T + C_{ss}) $$\n$$ J_g K_T + J_g C_{ss} = V_T C_{ss} + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} K_T C_{ss} + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss}^2 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $C_{ss}$ of the form $aC_{ss}^2 + bC_{ss} + c = 0$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss}^2 + (V_T + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} K_T - J_g) C_{ss} - J_g K_T = 0 $$\nThe coefficients are:\n$a = k_{\\mathrm{dc}}$\n$b = V_T + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} K_T - J_g$\n$c = -J_g K_T$\n\nThe physically meaningful solution for $C_{ss}$ (which must be non-negative) is given by the quadratic formula, taking the positive root:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{-(V_T + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} K_T - J_g) + \\sqrt{(V_T + k_{\\mathrm{dc}} K_T - J_g)^2 + 4k_{\\mathrm{dc}} J_g K_T}}{2k_{\\mathrm{dc}}} $$\n\n**4. Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the inhibited proteasomal flux $J_g$. The baseline flux is $J_{g,0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{3}$. A reduction to $30\\%$ of baseline means the new flux is:\n$$ J_g = 0.30 \\times J_{g,0} = 0.30 \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{3}) = 1.5 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ peptides/min} $$\nNow, we calculate the coefficients of the quadratic equation using the given parameter values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{dc}} = 0.05$\n$V_{T} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4}$\n$K_{T} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$\n\n$a = k_{\\mathrm{dc}} = 0.05$\n$b = (1.0 \\times 10^{4}) + (0.05)(5.0 \\times 10^{4}) - (1.5 \\times 10^{3}) = 10000 + 2500 - 1500 = 11000$\n$c = -(1.5 \\times 10^{3})(5.0 \\times 10^{4}) = -7.5 \\times 10^{7}$\n\nNow, we solve for $C_{ss}$:\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{-11000 + \\sqrt{(11000)^2 - 4(0.05)(-7.5 \\times 10^{7})}}{2(0.05)} $$\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{-11000 + \\sqrt{1.21 \\times 10^8 + 1.5 \\times 10^7}}{0.1} $$\n$$ C_{ss} = \\frac{-11000 + \\sqrt{1.36 \\times 10^8}}{0.1} \\approx \\frac{-11000 + 11661.9038}{0.1} = \\frac{661.9038}{0.1} \\approx 6619.04 $$\nThe steady-state cytosolic peptide pool is $C_{ss} \\approx 6619.04$ peptides.\n\nNext, we calculate the steady-state TAP flux, $J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss}$:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss} = J_g - k_{\\mathrm{dc}} C_{ss} = 1500 - (0.05)(6619.04) = 1500 - 330.952 = 1169.048 $$\nThe steady-state flux of peptides into the ER is $J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss} \\approx 1169.05$ peptides/min.\n\nFinally, we calculate the steady-state surface density $S_{ss}$:\n$$ S_{ss} = \\frac{k_s}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}(k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}})} J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss} $$\nUsing the given values $k_s = 0.06$, $k_{\\mathrm{de}} = 0.14$, and $k_{\\mathrm{turn}} = 0.006$:\n$$ \\frac{k_s}{k_{\\mathrm{turn}}(k_s + k_{\\mathrm{de}})} = \\frac{0.06}{0.006 \\times (0.06 + 0.14)} = \\frac{0.06}{0.006 \\times 0.20} = \\frac{0.06}{0.0012} = 50 $$\nThe unit of this prefactor is $\\mathrm{min}$.\n$$ S_{ss} = 50 \\times J_{\\mathrm{TAP}, ss} = 50 \\times 1169.048 \\approx 58452.4 $$\nThe final number of surface complexes is approximately $58452.4$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$ S_{ss} \\approx 5.845 \\times 10^4 $$",

The initial condition is given as the clone size at the time of symptom onset ($t=0$), which is $N(0) = N_0$.\n\nTo find the function $N(t)$, we solve this differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = r \\, dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, N=N_0)$ to a later state $(t, N(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{N_0}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N'} \\, dN' = \\int_{0}^{t} r \\, dt'\n$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|N'|]_{N_0}^{N(t)} = [r t']_{0}^{t}\n$$\nSince the cell population $N$ is always positive, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N_0) = r(t - 0)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can write:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right) = rt\n$$\nTo solve for $N(t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = \\exp(rt)\n$$\n$$\nN(t) = N_0 \\exp(rt)\n$$\nThis is the standard equation for exponential growth, describing the size of the T cell population at any given time $t$ during the expansion phase.\n\nThe problem asks for the time $t$ required for this population to reach the functional threshold for adaptive effector cells, denoted as $N^{\\ast}$. We set $N(t) = N^{\\ast}$ and solve for $t$:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = N_0 \\exp(rt)\n$$\nTo isolate $t$, we first divide by $N_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{N_0} = \\exp(rt)\n$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{N_0}\\right) = \\ln(\\exp(rt))\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{N_0}\\right) = rt\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{r} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{N_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the time required to reach the threshold.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $t$ using the given parameters:\n- Initial antigen-specific clone size: $N_0 = 7.5 \\times 10^{5}$ cells\n- Per-capita clonal expansion rate: $r = 0.90 \\ \\text{day}^{-1}$\n- Functional threshold for effector cells: $N^{\\ast} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9}$ cells\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{0.90} \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{9}}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}}\\right)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio inside the logarithm:\n$$\n\\frac{N^{\\ast}}{N_0} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{9}}{7.5 \\times 10^{5}} = \\frac{2.0}{7.5} \\times 10^{9-5} = \\frac{20}{75} \\times 10^{4} = \\frac{4}{15} \\times 10^{4} = \\frac{40000}{15} = \\frac{8000}{3}\n$$\nThe value of the ratio is approximately $2666.67$. Now, we calculate $t$:\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{0.90} \\ln\\left(\\frac{8000}{3}\\right)\n$$\nUsing computational tools for the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{8000}{3}\\right) \\approx 7.888583\n$$\nTherefore:\n$$\nt \\approx \\frac{7.888583}{0.90} \\approx 8.765092 \\ \\text{days}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final result to four significant figures.\n$$\nt \\approx 8.765 \\ \\text{days}\n$$\n\nFor the conceptual interpretation, this calculated time $t \\approx 8.765$ days represents the intrinsic kinetic delay of the primary adaptive immune response. It is the period after symptom onset during which the antigen-specific CD8 T cell population must undergo massive proliferation to reach a sufficient size to exert effective control over the viral pathogen. During this critical window, the host's defense relies on the innate immune system (e.g., NK cells, macrophages, and the effects of cytokines like Type I interferons). The innate response must contain the pathogen and limit its spread to prevent overwhelming infection and pathology before the more potent and specific adaptive T cell response becomes dominant at time $t$. This time lag is a fundamental trade-off in immunity, balancing the need for specificity with the time required to generate an effective number of effector cells from a very small pool of initial precursors.",
