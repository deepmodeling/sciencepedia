            "problem": "A labeled immunoassay (for example, an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)) uses a capture antibody immobilized on a solid phase, and the assay signal is proportional to the fraction of antibody binding sites occupied at equilibrium. Consider a single-site reversible binding interaction between an antibody and antigen with dissociation constant $K_{d}$ defined by the law of mass action, $K_{d} = \\dfrac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, where $[R]$ is free antibody, $[L]$ is free antigen, and $[RL]$ is the antibody–antigen complex.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium (the law of mass action) and conservation of mass. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique and meaningful solution. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in biophysical chemistry and molecular diagnostics.\n\nThe solution is developed in four parts: First, the exact expression for the fractional saturation $f$ is derived. Second, this expression is evaluated for the given numerical parameters. Third, the condition justifying a common approximation is derived. Finally, this condition is assessed for the given parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Exact Expression for Fractional Saturation, $f$**\n\nWe begin with the provided definitions. The system is governed by the reversible binding equilibrium between an antibody receptor ($R$) and an antigen ligand ($L$) to form a complex ($RL$):\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nThe dissociation constant, $K_d$, is defined by the law of mass action at equilibrium:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[L]$, and $[RL]$ are the molar concentrations of free antibody, free antigen, and the antibody-antigen complex, respectively.\n\nThe total concentrations of antibody, $[R]_0$, and antigen, $[L]_0$, are conserved. Assuming no nonspecific binding, the conservation of mass equations are:\n$$\n[R]_0 = [R] + [RL] \\implies [R] = [R]_0 - [RL]\n$$\n$$\n[L]_0 = [L] + [RL] \\implies [L] = [L]_0 - [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the free concentrations, $[R]$ and $[L]$, into the definition of $K_d$ yields an equation solely in terms of the complex concentration $[RL]$ and the known total concentrations:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{([R]_0 - [RL])([L]_0 - [RL])}{[RL]}\n$$\nTo solve for $[RL]$, we rearrange this equation into a standard quadratic form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x = [RL]$.\n$$\nK_d [RL] = ([R]_0 - [RL])([L]_0 - [RL])\n$$\n$$\nK_d [RL] = [R]_0 [L]_0 - [R]_0 [RL] - [L]_0 [RL] + [RL]^2\n$$\n$$\n[RL]^2 - ([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)[RL] + [R]_0 [L]_0 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $[RL]$ with coefficients $a = 1$, $b = -([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)$, and $c = [R]_0 [L]_0$. The solution is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{(-([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d))^2 - 4(1)([R]_0 [L]_0)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2}\n$$\nWe must select the physically valid root. The concentration of the complex, $[RL]$, cannot exceed the total concentration of either reactant, i.e., $[RL] \\le [R]_0$ and $[RL] \\le [L]_0$. Let us examine the case with the 'plus' sign. The magnitude of the numerator would be $([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) + \\sqrt{...}$. This value is strictly greater than $[R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d$. Consequently, the resulting $[RL]$ would be greater than $\\frac{[R]_0 + [L]_0}{2}$, which can violate the physical constraints. For instance, in the limiting case where $[L]_0 = 0$, we must have $[RL] = 0$. The equation becomes $[RL]^2 - ([R]_0+K_d)[RL] = 0$, with solutions $[RL]=0$ and $[RL]=[R]_0+K_d$. The latter is unphysical. The quadratic formula for $[L]_0=0$ gives $[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0+K_d) \\pm \\sqrt{([R]_0+K_d)^2}}{2} = \\frac{([R]_0+K_d) \\pm ([R]_0+K_d)}{2}$. The 'plus' root yields $[RL]=[R]_0+K_d$, while the 'minus' root correctly yields $[RL]=0$. Therefore, we must choose the minus sign.\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) - \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the fraction of occupied antibody binding sites, $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_0}$. Dividing the expression for $[RL]$ by $[R]_0$ gives the final exact closed-form expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d) - \\sqrt{([R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d)^2 - 4[R]_0 [L]_0}}{2[R]_0}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of $f$**\n\nWe are given the following values: $K_d = 1$ nM, $[L]_0 = 5$ nM, and $[R]_0 = 1$ nM. Since all concentrations and the dissociation constant are in the same units (nM), we can substitute the numerical values directly into the expression for $f$.\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the expression:\n$$\n[R]_0 + [L]_0 + K_d = 1 + 5 + 1 = 7\n$$\n$$\n4[R]_0 [L]_0 = 4(1)(5) = 20\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{7^2 - 20}}{2(1)} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{49 - 20}}{2} = \\frac{7 - \\sqrt{29}}{2}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the square root of $29$ and complete the calculation:\n$$\n\\sqrt{29} \\approx 5.3851648\n$$\n$$\nf \\approx \\frac{7 - 5.3851648}{2} = \\frac{1.6148352}{2} = 0.8074176\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\nf \\approx 0.8074\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Condition for the Approximation**\n\nThe simpler expression is given as $f \\approx \\frac{[L]_{0}}{K_{d} + [L]_{0}}$. This functional form is known as the Langmuir isotherm. It can be derived from the exact relationship $f = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}$ (obtained by rearranging $K_d [RL] = ([R]_0 - [RL])[L]$) under the assumption that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ is not significantly depleted by binding. That is, the concentration of free antigen is approximately equal to the total concentration of antigen:\n$$\n[L] \\approx [L]_0\n$$\nFrom the mass conservation law, $[L] = [L]_0 - [RL]$. The approximation is therefore justified if and only if the concentration of the bound complex is negligible compared to the total antigen concentration:\n$$\n[RL] \\ll [L]_0\n$$\nTo establish a mathematically controlled condition, we can use the approximate expression itself to estimate the magnitude of $[RL]$. From $f \\approx \\frac{[L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0}$ and $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R]_0}$, we have:\n$$\n[RL] = f[R]_0 \\approx \\frac{[R]_0 [L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0}\n$$\nSubstituting this estimate for $[RL]$ back into our condition $[RL] \\ll [L]_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0 [L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} \\ll [L]_0\n$$\nAssuming $[L]_0 > 0$, we can divide both sides by $[L]_0$ to obtain the general condition for the validity of the approximation:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} \\ll 1\n$$\nThis condition is often referred to as the non-depleting ligand (or antigen-in-excess) regime. It requires the total antibody concentration to be much smaller than the sum of the dissociation constant and the total antigen concentration.\n\n**Part 4: Numerical Assessment of the Condition**\n\nWe now assess whether this condition is satisfied for the given parameters: $K_d = 1$ nM, $[L]_0 = 5$ nM, and $[R]_0 = 1$ nM.\nWe calculate the value of the dimensionless parameter derived in Part 3:\n$$\n\\frac{[R]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} = \\frac{1}{1 + 5} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nThe value of this parameter is approximately $0.167$. The notation \"$\\ll 1$\" typically implies that the quantity is smaller than $1$ by at least an order of magnitude (i.e., less than or equal to $0.1$). A value of $1/6$ is not significantly smaller than $1$. Therefore, the condition is not well satisfied.\n\nWe can see the consequence of this by comparing the approximate value of $f$ with the exact value.\nThe approximate value is:\n$$\nf_{approx} = \\frac{[L]_0}{K_d + [L]_0} = \\frac{5}{1 + 5} = \\frac{5}{6} \\approx 0.8333\n$$\nThe exact value is $f_{exact} \\approx 0.8074$. The relative error is:\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\frac{|f_{approx} - f_{exact}|}{f_{exact}} = \\frac{|0.8333 - 0.8074|}{0.8074} \\approx \\frac{0.0259}{0.8074} \\approx 0.0321\n$$\nThis corresponds to an error of approximately $3.2\\%$. While this error might be acceptable for some purposes, it confirms that the approximation is not highly accurate because the condition for its validity is not strongly met.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of enzyme kinetics as applied to a standard immunodiagnostic technique, the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). All necessary parameters are provided for a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts: first, to derive an expression for the amount of product formed under saturating substrate conditions; second, to calculate this amount for the given parameters; and third, to discuss the limitations of this model due to substrate depletion.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Product Formation under Saturating Conditions**\n\nThe rate of an enzyme-catalyzed, single-substrate reaction is described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. In terms of molar concentrations, the reaction velocity $v$, defined as the rate of formation of product $[P]$, is given by:\n$$v = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{max}} [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nwhere $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $K_M$ is the Michaelis constant, and $V_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is the maximum reaction velocity.\n\nThe maximum velocity $V_{\\mathrm{max}}$ is achieved when the enzyme is fully saturated with substrate. It is related to the total enzyme concentration $[E]_T$ and the catalytic constant (turnover number) $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ by the definition:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{max}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T$$\nThe constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ represents the number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit time at saturation.\n\nLet us express the reaction rate in terms of the total amount (in moles) of substances, rather than concentration. Let $N_P(t)$ be the molar amount of product at time $t$, and $E_0$ be the total molar amount of enzyme. Let $V$ be the reaction volume. Then, $[P] = \\frac{N_P(t)}{V}$ and $[E]_T = \\frac{E_0}{V}$. Substituting these into the rate equations:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\frac{N_P(t)}{V} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\left( \\frac{E_0}{V} \\right) [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nAssuming the volume $V$ is constant, it can be factored out and cancelled:\n$$\\frac{1}{V} \\frac{dN_P(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\n$$\\frac{dN_P(t)}{dt} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 [S]}{K_M + [S]}$$\nThis equation gives the rate of product formation in moles per unit time. From this point forward, we will denote the molar amount of product as $P(t)$ for simplicity.\n\nThe problem specifies that the reaction starts under saturating substrate conditions, meaning the initial substrate concentration is much greater than the Michaelis constant: $[S] \\gg K_M$. Under this assumption, the denominator of the rate equation simplifies:\n$$K_M + [S] \\approx [S]$$\nThe rate of product formation thus becomes:\n$$\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} \\approx \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 [S]}{[S]} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0$$\nThis result shows that under saturating substrate conditions, the reaction rate is constant and independent of the substrate concentration. This is characteristic of a zero-order reaction. The rate is simply the maximum possible rate, determined by the amount of enzyme $E_0$ and its intrinsic catalytic efficiency $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. This aligns directly with the definition of $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$: it is the turnover rate per enzyme molecule at saturation, so the total turnover rate for an amount $E_0$ of enzyme is $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0$.\n\nTo find the cumulative amount of product $P(t)$ formed after a time interval $t$, we integrate this constant rate from time $t'=0$ to $t'=t$, with the initial condition that no product is present at the start, i.e., $P(0) = 0$.\n$$\\int_{P(0)}^{P(t)} dP = \\int_{0}^{t} k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 dt'$$\n$$P(t) - P(0) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 [t']_{0}^{t}$$\nSince $P(0) = 0$, the general expression for the cumulative amount of product at time $t$ is:\n$$P(t) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 t$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Cumulative Product**\n\nWe are given the following values:\nTotal amount of active HRP, $E_0 = 20$ fmol.\nCatalytic constant, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}} = 1000$ s$^{-1}$.\nReaction time, $t = 60$ s.\n\nFirst, we must express the amount of enzyme $E_0$ in the standard unit of moles.\n$$E_0 = 20 \\text{ fmol} = 20 \\times 10^{-15} \\text{ mol}$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into the derived expression:\n$$P(60 \\, \\text{s}) = (1000 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}) \\times (60 \\, \\text{s})$$\n$$P(60 \\, \\text{s}) = (1 \\times 10^3) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-15}) \\times (60) \\, \\text{mol}$$\n$$P(60 \\, \\text{s}) = 1200000 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}$$\n$$P(60 \\, \\text{s}) = 1.2 \\times 10^6 \\times 10^{-15} \\, \\text{mol}$$\n$$P(60 \\, \\text{s}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\text{mol}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to two significant figures. Our result, $1.2 \\times 10^{-9}$ mol, is already expressed with two significant figures.\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of Bias from Substrate Depletion**\n\nThe calculation above is an estimate based on the simplifying assumption that the substrate concentration $[S]$ remains constant and saturating ($[S] \\gg K_M$) throughout the entire reaction period of $t=60$ s. In any real system with a finite initial amount of substrate, this assumption will eventually fail.\n\nThe mechanism of the bias arises from the principles of mass balance and the functional form of the Michaelis-Menten equation.\n1.  **Mass Balance**: For every mole of product $P$ that is formed, one mole of substrate $S$ is consumed. If the initial substrate amount is $S_0$, then at any time $t$, the amount of substrate remaining is $S(t) = S_0 - P(t)$. In terms of concentrations, $[S](t) = [S]_0 - [P](t)$.\n2.  **Kinetics**: The true instantaneous reaction rate at time $t$ is not constant but depends on the instantaneous substrate concentration $[S](t)$:\n    $$v(t) = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T [S](t)}{K_M + [S](t)}$$\n    As the reaction proceeds, $[P](t)$ increases, causing $[S](t)$ to decrease. As $[S](t)$ decreases, the denominator term $K_M + [S](t)$ becomes more significant relative to $[S](t)$, and the overall ratio $\\frac{[S](t)}{K_M + [S](t)}$ decreases from its initial value, which was approximately $1$. Consequently, the reaction rate $v(t)$ continuously decreases from its maximum initial value of $v_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{cat}} [E]_T$.\n\nThe saturating-substrate estimate, $P_{est}(t) = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_0 t$, is the result of integrating a constant maximum rate over time. The true amount of product, $P_{true}(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} v(t') dt'$, is the result of integrating a continuously decreasing rate. Since $v(t) \\le v_{\\mathrm{max}}$ for all $t > 0$, it follows that $P_{true}(t) \\le P_{est}(t)$. Thus, the saturating-substrate estimate systematically **overestimates** the actual amount of product formed. The plot of actual product versus time is not a straight line but a curve that is initially linear and then bends downwards, approaching a plateau as the substrate is exhausted.\n\nThe bias becomes **non-negligible** when the assumption $[S](t) \\gg K_M$ is no longer valid. This occurs when the amount of substrate consumed, which is equal to the amount of product formed $P(t)$, becomes a significant fraction of either the initial substrate amount $S_0$ or the Michaelis constant $K_M$. For the zero-order approximation to be accurate, a common heuristic is that $[S]$ should be at least $10$ times $K_M$. The bias becomes pronounced when $[S](t)$ falls below this level. Therefore, the condition for the bias being non-negligible is when the amount of product formed, $P(t)$, is large enough such that the remaining substrate, $S_0 - P(t)$, is no longer much larger than the equivalent amount of substrate corresponding to the $K_M$ concentration. In simpler terms, the bias is significant when a substantial percentage (e.g., $>5-10\\%$) of the initial substrate pool has been consumed.",

The equilibrium is $A + D \\rightleftharpoons AD$, governed by the association constant $K_D = k_{\\mathrm{on},D}/k_{\\mathrm{off},D}$.\n    $$ [AD] = K_D [A] [D] $$\n    The total concentration of the detection antibody, $[D]_T$, is conserved:\n    $$ [D]_T = [D] + [AD] = [D] + K_D [A] [D] = [D](1 + K_D [A]) $$\n    Solving for the free detection antibody concentration $[D]$ gives:\n    $$ [D] = \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]} $$\n    This expression shows that as the analyte concentration $[A]$ increases, the free detection antibody concentration $[D]$ decreases due to sequestration in the bulk solution. This is the origin of the high-dose hook effect.\n\n3.  **Sandwich Formation on the Surface**: The captured analyte, represented by the density $N_{A,bound}$, can then bind a free detection antibody from the solution. This is another independent Langmuir-type binding process. The fraction of captured analyte sites that are bound by a detection antibody, $f_D$, is given by:\n    $$ f_D = \\frac{K_D [D]}{1 + K_D [D]} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $[D]$:\n    $$ f_D = \\frac{K_D \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]}}{1 + K_D \\frac{[D]_T}{1 + K_D [A]}} = \\frac{K_D [D]_T}{1 + K_D [A] + K_D [D]_T} $$\n\n4.  **Signal Expression**: The density of the signal-generating complex, $N_{CAD}$, is the total density of captured analyte multiplied by the fraction of those that are also bound by a detection antibody.\n    $$ N_{CAD} = N_{A,bound} \\times f_D = \\left( N_{C}^{T} \\frac{K_A [A]}{1 + K_A [A]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_D [D]_T}{1 + K_D [A] + K_D [D]_T} \\right) $$\n    The signal $S$ is proportional to $N_{CAD}$. Since $N_{C}^{T}$ and $K_D [D]_T$ are constants, the dependence of the signal on $[A]$ is:\n    $$ S([A]) \\propto \\frac{K_A [A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(1 + K_D [D]_T + K_D [A])} $$\n\n5.  **Finding the Peak Signal**: To find the analyte concentration $[A]_p$ that gives the maximum signal, we differentiate the expression for $S([A])$ with respect to $[A]$ and set the derivative to zero. Let $f([A]) = \\frac{[A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])}$, where $C = 1 + K_D [D]_T$ is a constant. We need to solve $\\frac{df}{d[A]} = 0$.\n    $$ \\frac{d}{d[A]} \\left(\\frac{[A]}{(1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])}\\right) = 0 $$\n    Using the quotient rule, the numerator of the derivative is:\n    $$ (1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A]) - [A] \\frac{d}{d[A]}((1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A])) = 0 $$\n    $$ (1 + K_A [A])(C + K_D [A]) - [A] (K_A(C + K_D [A]) + K_D(1 + K_A [A])) = 0 $$\n    $$ C + K_D [A] + C K_A [A] + K_A K_D [A]^2 - C K_A [A] - K_A K_D [A]^2 - K_D [A] - K_A K_D [A]^2 = 0 $$\n    $$ C - K_A K_D [A]^2 = 0 $$\n    Solving for $[A]$, we get the peak concentration $[A]_p$:\n    $$ [A]_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{K_A K_D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 + K_D [D]_T}{K_A K_D}} $$\n\n6.  **Solving for the Target Concentration**: We need to find the concentration $[A]$ on the high-concentration side of the peak ($[A] > [A]_p$) where the signal is $90\\%$ of the peak signal, i.e., $S([A]) = 0.9 S([A]_p)$. Let $y=K_A [A]$ and use the constants $R = K_A/K_D$ and $C = 1+K_D[D]_T$. The signal expression is proportional to $g(y) = \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)}$. The peak occurs at $y_p = K_A [A]_p = K_A \\sqrt{C/(K_A K_D)} = \\sqrt{K_A C / K_D} = \\sqrt{RC}$.\n    The equation to solve is $S([A]) = 0.9 S([A]_p)$, which translates to:\n    $$ \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)} = 0.9 \\left( \\frac{y_p}{(1+y_p)(C+y_p/R)} \\right) $$\n    Substituting $y_p=\\sqrt{RC}$: the RHS is $0.9 \\frac{\\sqrt{RC}}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})(C+\\sqrt{C/R})} = 0.9 \\frac{\\sqrt{RC}}{\\sqrt{C}(1+\\sqrt{RC})(\\sqrt{C}+1/\\sqrt{R})} = 0.9\\frac{\\sqrt{R}}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})(\\sqrt{C}+1/\\sqrt{R})} = 0.9\\frac{R}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2}$.\n    $$ \\frac{y}{(1+y)(C+y/R)} = \\frac{0.9 R}{(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2} $$\n    $$ y(1+\\sqrt{RC})^2 = 0.9 R (1+y)(C+y/R) = 0.9(1+y)(RC+y) $$\n    $$ y(1+2\\sqrt{RC}+RC) = 0.9(RC+y+RCy+y^2) $$\n    $$ 0.9y^2 + (0.9 + 0.9RC - 1 - 2\\sqrt{RC} - RC)y + 0.9RC = 0 $$\n    $$ 0.9y^2 + (-0.1 - 0.1RC - 2\\sqrt{RC})y + 0.9RC = 0 $$\n    This is a quadratic equation for $y = K_A[A]$.\n\n7.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    - $K_A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n    - $K_D = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^5}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 2.0 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}$.\n    - $[D]_T = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{nM} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}$.\n    - $K_D [D]_T = (2.0 \\times 10^7 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}})(2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M}) = 0.04$.\n    - $C = 1 + K_D [D]_T = 1.04$.\n    - $R = K_A/K_D = (1.0 \\times 10^9)/(2.0 \\times 10^7) = 50$.\n    - $RC = 50 \\times 1.04 = 52$.\n    - $\\sqrt{RC} = \\sqrt{52}$.\n\n    The quadratic equation is $ay^2+by+c=0$ with:\n    - $a = 0.9$.\n    - $b = -0.1 - 0.1(52) - 2\\sqrt{52} = -5.3 - 2\\sqrt{52}$.\n    - $c = 0.9(52) = 46.8$.\n    $b \\approx -5.3 - 2(7.21110) = -19.7222$.\n    The equation is $0.9y^2 - 19.7222 y + 46.8 = 0$.\n    The solutions are $y = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n    $$ y = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{(-19.7222)^2 - 4(0.9)(46.8)}}{2(0.9)} $$\n    $$ y = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{388.965 - 168.48}}{1.8} = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm \\sqrt{220.485}}{1.8} = \\frac{19.7222 \\pm 14.8487}{1.8} $$\n    The two solutions for $y$ are:\n    $$ y_1 = \\frac{19.7222 + 14.8487}{1.8} = \\frac{34.5709}{1.8} \\approx 19.2061 $$\n    $$ y_2 = \\frac{19.7222 - 14.8487}{1.8} = \\frac{4.8735}{1.8} \\approx 2.7075 $$\n    The peak is at $y_p = \\sqrt{RC} = \\sqrt{52} \\approx 7.2111$.\n    We are looking for the concentration on the high-concentration branch, which means we need the solution where $[A] > [A]_p$, and therefore $y > y_p$. We choose $y_1 \\approx 19.2061$.\n    Finally, we find the analyte concentration $[A]$:\n    $$ [A] = \\frac{y_1}{K_A} = \\frac{19.2061}{1.0 \\times 10^9 \\ \\mathrm{M^{-1}}} = 19.2061 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{M} $$\n    The result is $19.2061 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $19.21 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$.",
