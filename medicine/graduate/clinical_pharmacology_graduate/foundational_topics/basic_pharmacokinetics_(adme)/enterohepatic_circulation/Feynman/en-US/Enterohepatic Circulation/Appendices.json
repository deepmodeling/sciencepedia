This process is often governed by the pH-partition hypothesis, which posits that only the un-ionized, more lipophilic form of a drug can readily cross cell membranes via passive diffusion. This exercise provides a foundational understanding by tasking you to apply the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to a weak acid drug, calculating the fraction available for uptake in the specific pH environment of the ileum and linking this chemical property directly to its reabsorption efficiency .",

            "problem": "A monoprotic weak acid drug participates in enterohepatic circulation (EHC). After biliary excretion of a conjugate and subsequent deconjugation by gut microbiota, the parent weak acid is presented to the terminal ileum where passive transcellular reabsorption can occur. The drug has acid dissociation constant characterized by $pK_{a} = 4.5$, and the ileal lumen is at $pH = 7.0$. Assume the following:\n\n- The unionized species of the weak acid, denoted $HA$, is the permeability-dominant form, while the ionized form $A^{-}$ has negligible membrane permeability.\n- Use the law of mass action for $HA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}$ together with the definitions of $pK_{a}$ and $pH$ to derive the fraction unionized $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$ at $pH = 7.0$.\n- Passive transcellular uptake from the lumen can be described by one-dimensional Fickian transport into a well-stirred mucosal compartment, which under conditions of constant luminal concentration profile over the residence time reduces to apparent first-order uptake with rate constant $k = k_{\\mathrm{u}}\\,f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{u}}$ is the intrinsic first-order uptake rate constant for the fully unionized species.\n- Take $k_{\\mathrm{u}} = 3.0\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ for the ileal segment and an ileal residence time $t = 1.5\\,\\text{h}$. Assume $k$ is time-invariant over $t$.\n\nStarting from the acid-base equilibrium and Fick’s first law, derive the expression for the fraction reabsorbed over the residence time, $F$, in terms of $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, $k_{\\mathrm{u}}$, and $t$, and then compute the enterohepatic recycling efficiency per pass through the ileum, identified here with $F$, for the given parameters. Express your final answer as a unitless decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of acid-base chemistry and pharmacokinetic modeling, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is expressed in objective, formal language.

Derive the expression for the fraction of a weak acid in its unionized form, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$.\n2.  Derive the expression for the fraction of the drug reabsorbed, $F$, under a first-order uptake model.\n3.  Calculate the numerical value of $F$ using the given parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Fraction Unionized ($f_{\\mathrm{U}}$)**\n\nA monoprotic weak acid, denoted $HA$, dissociates in an aqueous solution according to the equilibrium:\n$$\nHA \\rightleftharpoons H^{+} + A^{-}\n$$\nwhere $HA$ is the unionized species and $A^{-}$ is the ionized (conjugate base) species. The acid dissociation constant, $K_{a}$, for this reaction is defined by the law of mass action as:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[H^{+}][A^{-}]}{[HA]}\n$$\nwhere brackets denote molar concentrations.\n\nBy definition, $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$ and $pH = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}])$. Taking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the $K_{a}$ expression yields:\n$$\n-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}([H^{+}]) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $pK_{a}$ and $pH$:\n$$\npK_{a} = pH - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nThis rearranges to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$\npH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this equation, we can express the ratio of the ionized to unionized species:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}\\right) = pH - pK_{a}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]} = 10^{pH - pK_{a}}\n$$\nThe fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, is the concentration of the unionized species, $[HA]$, divided by the total concentration of the drug, $[C_{\\text{total}}] = [HA] + [A^{-}]$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{[HA]}{[C_{\\text{total}}]} = \\frac{[HA]}{[HA] + [A^{-}]}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[HA]$ gives:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the ratio $\\frac{[A^{-}]}{[HA]}$:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a}}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the fraction unionized for a monoprotic weak acid.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Fraction Reabsorbed ($F$)**\n\nThe problem states that drug uptake from the lumen follows apparent first-order kinetics. Let $M(t)$ be the mass of the drug in a differential fluid volume as it transits the ileum. The rate of change of this mass due to reabsorption is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dM(t)}{dt} = -k M(t)\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the apparent first-order uptake rate constant. This is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating. Let $M_0$ be the initial mass of the drug entering the ileal segment at time $t=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{M_0}^{M(t)} \\frac{dM}{M} = \\int_0^t -k \\, dt'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{M(t)}{M_0}\\right) = -kt\n$$\n$$\nM(t) = M_0 \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe residence time in the ileum is given as $t$. The mass of drug remaining at the end of the segment is $M(t)$. The fraction of drug remaining is $\\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = \\exp(-kt)$. The fraction reabsorbed, $F$, is equal to $1$ minus the fraction remaining:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\frac{M(t)}{M_0} = 1 - \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the apparent rate constant $k$ is related to the intrinsic uptake rate constant of the unionized species, $k_{\\mathrm{u}}$, and the fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$, by the expression $k = k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $F$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t)\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation of $F$**\n\nWe now substitute the given values into the derived expressions.\nGiven parameters:\n- $pK_{a} = 4.5$\n- $pH = 7.0$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{u}} = 3.0\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$\n- $t = 1.5\\,\\text{h}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fraction unionized, $f_{\\mathrm{U}}$:\n$$\npH - pK_{a} = 7.0 - 4.5 = 2.5\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pH - pK_{a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\n$$\nNumerically, $10^{2.5} = 10^{2} \\times 10^{0.5} = 100\\sqrt{10} \\approx 316.227766$.\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 316.227766} = \\frac{1}{317.227766} \\approx 0.00315227\n$$\nNext, we calculate the enterohepatic recycling efficiency per pass, $F$:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t)\n$$\nThe product in the exponent is:\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t = -(3.0\\,\\text{h}^{-1}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\\right) \\times (1.5\\,\\text{h})\n$$\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t = -4.5 \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{2.5}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical value of the fraction:\n$$\n-k_{\\mathrm{u}}f_{\\mathrm{U}}t \\approx -4.5 \\times 0.00315227 \\approx -0.01418522\n$$\nNow we can compute $F$:\n$$\nF = 1 - \\exp(-0.01418522) \\approx 1 - 0.98591039 \\approx 0.01408961\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nF \\approx 0.01409\n$$",

A fraction $f_{\\text{bile}}$ of this cleared amount is excreted into the bile as a reabsorbable species. The amount excreted into the bile from this first pass is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{bile},1} = A_{0} \\cdot f_{\\text{bile}}\n$$\nThis amount enters the intestinal lumen. A fraction $F_{\\text{reabs}}$ of this luminal amount is then reabsorbed back into the systemic circulation.

Since $f_{\\text{bile}}$ and $F_{\\text{reabs}}$ are fractions between $0$ and $1$, the common ratio $|r| < 1$, ensuring the series converges. The sum of a convergent geometric series is given by $\\frac{a}{1-r}$.\nTherefore, the total systemic input is:\n$$\nA_{\\text{sys,total}} = \\frac{A_{0}}{1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs}}}\n$$\nSubstituting $A_{0} = F_{0} D$:\n$$\nA_{\\text{sys,total}} = \\frac{F_{0} D}{1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs}}}\n$$\n\n**Final Expression for AUC:**\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{\\text{sys,total}}$ into the definition of AUC, we obtain the general formula:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = \\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL} (1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs}})}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Decrease in AUC\n\nWe are asked to compute the absolute decrease in AUC, $\\Delta \\text{AUC}$, when cholestyramine reduces the fraction reabsorbed from a baseline value, which we denote $F_{\\text{reabs,1}}$, to an inhibited value, $F_{\\text{reabs,2}}$.\n\n$\\Delta \\text{AUC} = \\text{AUC}_{\\text{baseline}} - \\text{AUC}_{\\text{inhibited}}$\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{AUC} = \\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL} (1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,1}})} - \\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL} (1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,2}})}\n$$\nWe can factor out the common term $\\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{AUC} = \\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,1}}} - \\frac{1}{1 - f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,2}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe given numerical values are:\n-   $D = 1000$ mg\n-   $F_{0} = 0.9$\n-   $\\mathrm{CL} = 10$ L/h\n-   $f_{\\text{bile}} = 0.5$\n-   $F_{\\text{reabs,1}} = 0.4$ (baseline)\n-   $F_{\\text{reabs,2}} = 0.1$ (inhibited)\n\nFirst, calculate the common factor:\n$$\n\\frac{F_{0} D}{\\mathrm{CL}} = \\frac{0.9 \\times 1000 \\, \\text{mg}}{10 \\, \\text{L/h}} = \\frac{900 \\, \\text{mg}}{10 \\, \\text{L/h}} = 90 \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}\n$$\nNext, calculate the terms inside the parentheses:\nThe recycling factor for the baseline case is $f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,1}} = 0.5 \\times 0.4 = 0.2$.\nThe recycling factor for the inhibited case is $f_{\\text{bile}} F_{\\text{reabs,2}} = 0.5 \\times 0.1 = 0.05$.\nThe expression in parentheses becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 - 0.2} - \\frac{1}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{1}{0.8} - \\frac{1}{0.95} = 1.25 - \\frac{1}{19/20} = \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{20}{19}\n$$\nTo combine these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $4 \\times 19 = 76$:\n$$\n\\frac{5 \\times 19}{4 \\times 19} - \\frac{20 \\times 4}{19 \\times 4} = \\frac{95}{76} - \\frac{80}{76} = \\frac{15}{76}\n$$\nNow, we multiply this result by the common factor:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{AUC} = 90 \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L} \\times \\frac{15}{76} = \\frac{1350}{76} \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L} = \\frac{675}{38} \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{AUC} = \\frac{675}{38} \\approx 17.763157... \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\text{AUC} \\approx 17.76 \\, \\text{mg} \\cdot \\text{h/L}\n$$",

Since both $q(t)$ and $h(t)$ are causal (i.e., zero for $t<0$), we have:\n$$\\mathrm{AUC} = \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} q(t) \\,dt \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(t) \\,dt \\right)$$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} q(t) \\,dt$ represents the total amount of drug, $A_{total}$, that enters the systemic circulation. The term $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} h(t) \\,dt$ is a constant related to the drug's systemic clearance ($CL$), specifically $\\frac{1}{CL}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{AUC} = \\frac{A_{total}}{CL}$.\n\nThe EHC index is defined as the ratio of the AUC attributable to the EHC pulses to the total AUC. Let $\\mathrm{AUC}_{EHC}$ be the AUC from the recycling pulses and $\\mathrm{AUC}_{total}$ be the total AUC.\n$$\\text{EHC Index} = \\frac{\\mathrm{AUC}_{EHC}}{\\mathrm{AUC}_{total}}$$\nThe input rate from EHC is $q_{EHC}(t) = q_{1}(t) + q_{2}(t) + q_{3}(t)$. The amount absorbed from EHC is $A_{EHC} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} q_{EHC}(t) \\,dt$. The corresponding AUC is $\\mathrm{AUC}_{EHC} = \\frac{A_{EHC}}{CL}$.\nSubstituting these into the EHC index definition:\n$$\\text{EHC Index} = \\frac{A_{EHC}/CL}{A_{total}/CL} = \\frac{A_{EHC}}{A_{total}}$$\nThis shows that the EHC index is equivalent to the fraction of the total absorbed drug amount that is due to enterohepatic recycling. We must calculate the total amount absorbed from each component by integrating the respective rate function from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$.\n\nThe total amount absorbed, $A_{total}$, is the sum of the amounts from each component:\n$A_{total} = A_{p} + A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3}$, where $A_{i} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} q_{i}(t) \\,dt$.\nThe amount from EHC is $A_{EHC} = A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3}$.\nThe EHC Index is therefore:\n$$\\text{EHC Index} = \\frac{A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3}}{A_{p} + A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3}}$$\n\nWe now compute each integral:\n$1$. For the primary absorption component, $A_{p}$:\n$$A_{p} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} a_{p}\\, t\\, \\exp(-k_{p} t) \\,dt = a_{p} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t\\, \\exp(-k_{p} t) \\,dt$$\nThis is a standard integral form related to the Gamma function. The result is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n \\exp(-kt) dt = \\frac{n!}{k^{n+1}}$. For $n=1$:\n$$A_{p} = a_{p} \\left( \\frac{1!}{k_{p}^{1+1}} \\right) = \\frac{a_{p}}{k_{p}^{2}}$$\n\n$2$. For the first recycling pulse, $A_{1}$:\n$$A_{1} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} b_{1}\\, \\exp(-\\lambda_{1}(t-\\tau_{1}))\\,\\mathrm{H}(t-\\tau_{1}) \\,dt = b_{1} \\int_{\\tau_{1}}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda_{1}(t-\\tau_{1})) \\,dt$$\nUsing the substitution $u = t-\\tau_{1}$, $du=dt$. The limits become $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$.\n$$A_{1} = b_{1} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} u) \\,du = b_{1} \\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}} \\exp(-\\lambda_{1} u) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = b_{1} \\left( 0 - (-\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{1}}) \\right) = \\frac{b_{1}}{\\lambda_{1}}$$\n\n$3$. For the second recycling pulse, $A_{2}$, the form is identical to $A_{1}$:\n$$A_{2} = \\frac{b_{2}}{\\lambda_{2}}$$\n\n$4$. For the third recycling pulse, $A_{3}$, the form is identical to $A_{p}$ after a change of variable:\n$$A_{3} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} c\\, (t-\\tau_{3})\\, \\exp(-\\mu (t-\\tau_{3}))\\,\\mathrm{H}(t-\\tau_{3}) \\,dt = c \\int_{\\tau_{3}}^{\\infty} (t-\\tau_{3})\\, \\exp(-\\mu (t-\\tau_{3})) \\,dt$$\nUsing the substitution $u = t - \\tau_{3}$, $du=dt$, with limits $u=0$ to $u=\\infty$:\n$$A_{3} = c \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u\\, \\exp(-\\mu u) \\,du = c \\left( \\frac{1!}{\\mu^{1+1}} \\right) = \\frac{c}{\\mu^{2}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values:\n$A_{p} = \\frac{a_{p}}{k_{p}^{2}} = \\frac{180}{(0.9)^{2}} = \\frac{180}{0.81} = \\frac{18000}{81} = \\frac{2000}{9}$ mg.\n$A_{1} = \\frac{b_{1}}{\\lambda_{1}} = \\frac{40}{1.6} = \\frac{400}{16} = 25$ mg.\n$A_{2} = \\frac{b_{2}}{\\lambda_{2}} = \\frac{30}{1.2} = \\frac{300}{12} = 25$ mg.\n$A_{3} = \\frac{c}{\\mu^{2}} = \\frac{50}{(1.0)^{2}} = 50$ mg.\n\nWe calculate the total amount from EHC, $A_{EHC}$:\n$$A_{EHC} = A_{1} + A_{2} + A_{3} = 25 + 25 + 50 = 100 \\text{ mg}$$\nThe total amount absorbed, $A_{total}$:\n$$A_{total} = A_{p} + A_{EHC} = \\frac{2000}{9} + 100 = \\frac{2000 + 900}{9} = \\frac{2900}{9} \\text{ mg}$$\nFinally, we compute the EHC index:\n$$\\text{EHC Index} = \\frac{A_{EHC}}{A_{total}} = \\frac{100}{\\frac{2900}{9}} = \\frac{100 \\times 9}{2900} = \\frac{900}{2900} = \\frac{9}{29}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\\text{EHC Index} = \\frac{9}{29} \\approx 0.3103448...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.3103$.",
