The pH-partition hypothesis posits that only the uncharged, more lipophilic form of a drug can readily permeate these membranes. This first exercise provides quantitative practice in applying the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to determine the fraction of a weak base that exists in its absorbable, unionized form within a specific physiological environment, offering insight into its potential for absorption .",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in principles of acid-base chemistry and pharmacokinetics, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe analysis begins with the equilibrium for the conjugate acid of the monoprotic weak base, denoted as $\\mathrm{B}$. The conjugate acid is $\\mathrm{BH^+}$. The dissociation of this acid in an aqueous medium is given by the reaction:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BH^+} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{B} + \\mathrm{H^+}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathrm{BH^+}$ is the protonated, ionized form of the drug, and $\\mathrm{B}$ is the unprotonated, unionized, neutral base.\n\nThe acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for this equilibrium is defined by the law of mass action:\n$$\nK_a = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{[\\mathrm{BH^+}]}\n$$\nwhere $[\\mathrm{B}]$, $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$, and $[\\mathrm{BH^+}]$ represent the molar concentrations of the unprotonated base, hydrogen ions, and the protonated base, respectively.\n\nThe total concentration of the drug, $C_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of both the protonated and unprotonated forms:\n$$\nC_T = [\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH^+}]\n$$\nThe fraction of the drug present in the unprotonated (unionized) form, $f_u$, is the ratio of the concentration of the unprotonated form to the total drug concentration:\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{C_T} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + [\\mathrm{BH^+}]}\n$$\nTo express $f_u$ in terms of $K_a$ and $[\\mathrm{H^+}]$, we first rearrange the $K_a$ expression to solve for $[\\mathrm{BH^+}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{BH^+}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{BH^+}]$ into the denominator of the equation for $f_u$:\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}] + \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}][\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a}}\n$$\nFactoring out $[\\mathrm{B}]$ from the denominator and canceling the term yields:\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{[\\mathrm{B}]}{[\\mathrm{B}]\\left(1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_a}}\n$$\nThis expression can be converted to use the logarithmic scales $pH$ and $pK_a$. By definition, $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H^+}])$ and $pK_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$. Therefore, $[\\mathrm{H^+}] = 10^{-pH}$ and $K_a = 10^{-pK_a}$. Substituting these into the expression for $f_u$:\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-pH}}{10^{-pK_a}}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{-pH - (-pK_a)}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final derived expression for $f_u$ as a function of $pH$ and $pK_a$:\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{pK_a - pH}}\n$$\nThis is a form of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation rearranged to solve for the fraction of the basic species.\n\nNext, we evaluate $f_u$ numerically using the provided values: $pK_a = 8.5$ for the conjugate acid of the weak base and $pH = 6.5$ for the human jejunum.\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^{8.5 - 6.5}} = \\frac{1}{1 + 10^2}\n$$\n$$\nf_u = \\frac{1}{1 + 100} = \\frac{1}{101}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\nf_u \\approx 0.00990099 \\dots \\approx 0.009901\n$$\n\nFinally, we interpret the magnitude of this calculated value. According to the principles of passive transcellular diffusion (the pH-partition hypothesis), the primary driving force for the absorption of a drug across a biological lipid membrane, such as the intestinal epithelium, is the concentration gradient of its uncharged, non-polar form. The uncharged form ($\\mathrm{B}$) is significantly more lipid-soluble (lipophilic) than its charged, polar counterpart ($\\mathrm{BH^+}$) and thus permeates the cell membrane much more readily.\nThe calculated fraction of the unprotonated (unionized) form is $f_u \\approx 0.009901$, which corresponds to approximately $0.99\\%$. This means that at the $pH$ of the jejunum ($6.5$), more than $99\\%$ of the weak base drug exists in its protonated, ionized form ($\\mathrm{BH^+}$), which is poorly absorbed. Less than $1\\%$ of the total drug concentration is in the absorbable, unionized form ($\\mathrm{B}$).\nConsequently, the concentration gradient of the absorbable species across the jejunal mucosa is very small. This low value of $f_u$ implies a significantly reduced driving force for passive transcellular absorption for this weak base in the jejunum. The drug's absorption in this segment of the intestine is expected to be slow and inefficient. Better absorption would be expected in a more alkaline environment, such as the ileum or colon, where the $pH$ is higher and closer to the drug's $pK_a$, leading to a larger fraction of the unionized form.",

            "introduction": "While permeability is crucial, a drug must first be dissolved in the gastrointestinal fluids before it can be absorbed. For many orally administered drugs, particularly those with low intrinsic solubility, the rate of dissolution is often the rate-limiting step to bioavailability. This next practice explores the critical relationship between pH, ionization, and total solubility, demonstrating how a drug's solubility profile can vary dramatically along the GI tract and consequently influence its dissolution rate and optimal site for absorption .",

            "problem": "An orally administered monoprotic weak acid drug, denoted by $\\mathrm{HA}$, has an intrinsic solubility $S_{0}$ at saturation for the unionized form at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. Intrinsic solubility is defined as the maximum equilibrium concentration of the unionized species $\\mathrm{HA}$ in the solvent when precipitation of the unionized solid phase constrains $\\mathrm{HA}$ at saturation. At a given $\\mathrm{pH}$, the total solubility $S(\\mathrm{pH})$ is the sum of the equilibrium concentrations of the unionized and ionized species at saturation. Assume a single ionizable group (monoprotic), negligible ionic strength effects so that activity coefficients are approximately unity, and that the ionized form’s solubility does not limit saturation of the unionized solid phase (that is, precipitation is governed by the unionized phase only). \n\nStarting from the law of mass action for acid dissociation and the definition of intrinsic solubility, derive an expression for $S(\\mathrm{pH})$ in terms of $S_{0}$ and $pK_{a}$ without invoking any pre-derived solubility-pH formulas.

            "solution": "The solution first requires deriving the equation for pH-dependent solubility, $S(\\mathrm{pH})$, and then using it to calculate the fold-change and interpret the consequences.\n\nThe dissociation of the monoprotic weak acid, $\\mathrm{HA}$, is $\\mathrm{HA} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H}^+ + \\mathrm{A}^-$, with an acid dissociation constant $K_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H}^+][\\mathrm{A}^-]}{[\\mathrm{HA}]}$. Total solubility is the sum of the saturated concentrations of the unionized and ionized species: $S(\\mathrm{pH}) = [\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{sat}} + [\\mathrm{A}^-]_{\\text{sat}}$. Since saturation is governed by the unionized solid, $[\\mathrm{HA}]_{\\text{sat}}$ is constant and equal to the intrinsic solubility, $S_{0}$. From the $K_a$ expression, we find $[\\mathrm{A}^-]_{\\text{sat}} = \\frac{K_{a} S_{0}}{[\\mathrm{H}^+]}$. Substituting these into the total solubility equation and factoring out $S_0$ gives $S(\\mathrm{pH}) = S_{0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{K_{a}}{[\\mathrm{H}^+]} \\right)$. Using the standard definitions of $\\mathrm{pH}$ and $pK_{a}$, this becomes the desired expression:\n$$ S(\\mathrm{pH}) = S_{0} \\left( 1 + 10^{\\mathrm{pH} - pK_{a}} \\right) $$\n\nNext, we compute the fold-change in total solubility between the ileum ($\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{ileum}} = 7.6$) and the duodenum ($\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{duodenum}} = 5.8$) for the drug with $pK_{a} = 5.0$.

A ~55-fold higher solubility in the ileum means the dissolution rate (per the Noyes-Whitney equation) will be significantly faster there. This creates a trade-off: the duodenum has a higher fraction of absorbable unionized drug, but slow dissolution may be the bottleneck. The ileum has a tiny fraction of absorbable drug, but rapid dissolution ensures the concentration of this absorbable species is maintained at its maximum ($S_0$), promoting steady absorption. For this drug with low intrinsic solubility ($S_{0} = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}$), it is likely a **BCS Class 2 (Low Solubility, High Permeability)** compound. For such drugs, absorption is dissolution rate-limited. Therefore, the higher pH regions of the distal small intestine (jejunum/ileum) are critical for achieving adequate bioavailability, despite the lower fraction of unionized drug at that site.",

            "introduction": "Moving from physicochemical principles to in-vivo outcomes, the ultimate measure of successful oral absorption is absolute bioavailability ($F$), the fraction of an administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation intact. Low bioavailability can result from either poor absorption across the gut wall or extensive pre-systemic elimination, known as first-pass metabolism.

            "problem": "A new orally administered small-molecule candidate was evaluated in a randomized, two-period crossover study in healthy adults under linear pharmacokinetics, with no time-dependent changes in systemic clearance and identical systemic clearance across routes. Each subject received a single oral dose of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and, in a separate period, a single intravenous dose of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. The measured area under the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity after the intravenous dose was $AUC_{iv} = 3.20\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$.

Round your numerical result to three significant figures and express it as a decimal (do not use a percentage).\n\nThen, based solely on the provided fecal recovery observation, interpret whether the computed $F$ is more plausibly limited by gastrointestinal absorption across the intestinal epithelium or by first-pass extraction in the intestine and liver. Your interpretation does not need to be quantified.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, and a subsequent interpretation of the factors limiting it. The solution proceeds in two parts.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, from first principles. Systemic clearance, $CL$, is defined as the volume of plasma cleared of a drug per unit time. Under conditions of linear pharmacokinetics, it can be calculated as the ratio of the total amount of drug that reaches the systemic circulation to the total systemic drug exposure, measured as the area under the plasma concentration–time curve from time zero to infinity ($AUC$).\n\nFor a single intravenous ($iv$) dose, $D_{iv}$, the entire dose is administered directly into the systemic circulation. Thus, the clearance is given by the equation:\n$$CL = \\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nFor a single oral ($po$) dose, $D_{po}$, only a fraction, $F$, of the administered dose reaches the systemic circulation due to incomplete absorption and/or first-pass metabolism. This fraction $F$ is the absolute oral bioavailability. The total amount of drug reaching the systemic circulation is therefore $F \\cdot D_{po}$. The clearance for the oral route is expressed as:\n$$CL = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nThe problem states that systemic clearance is identical across routes of administration. This allows us to equate the two expressions for $CL$:\n$$\\frac{D_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}} = \\frac{F \\cdot D_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the absolute bioavailability, $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{D_{iv}}{D_{po}} \\cdot \\frac{AUC_{po}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data: $D_{po} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $D_{iv} = 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, $AUC_{po} = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$, and $AUC_{iv} = 3.20\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}$. Substituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$F = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mg}} \\cdot \\frac{1.12\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}}{3.20\\,\\mathrm{mg \\cdot h \\cdot L^{-1}}}$$\nThe dose terms cancel out, simplifying the calculation to the ratio of the AUC values:\n$$F = \\frac{1.12}{3.20} = 0.350$$\nThe absolute oral bioavailability is $F = 0.350$.\n\nSecond, we interpret this result based on the fecal recovery data. Absolute bioavailability ($F$) is the product of the fraction of the dose absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, $F_a$, and the fraction of the absorbed drug that escapes first-pass elimination in the gut wall and liver, $F_{FP}$. Thus, $F = F_a \\cdot F_{FP}$.\n\nThe problem states that the fraction of the oral dose recovered unchanged in the feces, $f_{fe}$, is $0.06$. This value represents the portion of the administered oral dose that was not absorbed across the intestinal epithelium. Assuming that degradation of the drug in the GI lumen is negligible, the unabsorbed fraction is $1 - F_a$. Therefore:\n$$f_{fe} = 1 - F_a = 0.06$$\nFrom this, we can determine the fraction of the dose that was absorbed:\n$$F_a = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94$$\nThis indicates that absorption from the GI tract is very high, at approximately $94\\%$. Since $F_a$ is close to $1$, poor absorption is not the primary factor limiting the drug's overall bioavailability.\n\nThe significant difference between the fraction absorbed ($F_a \\approx 0.94$) and the overall bioavailability ($F = 0.350$) must be due to extensive first-pass extraction. We can estimate the fraction escaping first-pass metabolism, $F_{FP}$, using the relationship $F = F_a \\cdot F_{FP}$:\n$$0.350 = 0.94 \\cdot F_{FP}$$\nSolving for $F_{FP}$:\n$$F_{FP} = \\frac{0.350}{0.94} \\approx 0.372$$\nThis result suggests that only about $37.2\\%$ of the drug that is absorbed from the GI tract successfully reaches the systemic circulation, while the majority (approximately $1 - 0.372 = 0.628$, or $62.8\\%$) is eliminated by the gut wall and/or liver before it can be distributed systemically.\n\nIn conclusion, the computation shows that the absolute oral bioavailability is $F=0.350$. Based on the provided fecal recovery data, which indicates that absorption is nearly complete ($F_a \\approx 0.94$), it is most plausible that the low bioavailability is limited by extensive first-pass extraction, not by poor gastrointestinal absorption across the intestinal epithelium.",
