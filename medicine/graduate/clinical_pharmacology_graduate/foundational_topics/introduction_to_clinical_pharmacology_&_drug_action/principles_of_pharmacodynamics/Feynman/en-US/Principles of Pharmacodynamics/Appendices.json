            "problem": "Consider a single receptor population with total receptor concentration $R_T$ in a well-mixed system at equilibrium. Two ligands bind to the same orthosteric site and compete for occupancy: a full agonist $A$ with equilibrium dissociation constant $K_A$ and a partial agonist $P$ with equilibrium dissociation constant $K_P$. Assume binding obeys the law of mass action, and let the efficacy per occupied receptor (intrinsic efficacy) be $\\varepsilon_A$ for the full agonist $A$ and $\\varepsilon_P$ for the partial agonist $P$.

            "solution": "1.  **Derivation of the Effect-Occupancy Relationship**\n\n    The operational model of agonism links the observed effect, $E$, to an intermediate stimulus, $S$, via a hyperbolic relationship. For a Hill coefficient $n=1$:\n    $$ E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot S}{K_S + S} $$\n    Here, $E_{\\max}$ is the maximal tissue response and $K_S$ is the stimulus producing a half-maximal response.\n\n    The stimulus $S$ is proportional to the concentration of agonist-receptor complexes, which is the product of the total receptor concentration $[R_{tot}]$, the fractional occupancy $f$, and the agonist's intrinsic efficacy $\\epsilon$:\n    $$ S = \\epsilon \\cdot [R_{tot}] \\cdot f $$\n    Substituting this into the effect equation:\n    $$ E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot (\\epsilon \\cdot [R_{tot}] \\cdot f)}{K_S + (\\epsilon \\cdot [R_{tot}] \\cdot f)} $$\n    To simplify, we divide the numerator and denominator by $K_S$ and introduce the transducer ratio, $\\tau = \\frac{\\epsilon \\cdot [R_{tot}]}{K_S}$. This dimensionless parameter $\\tau$ represents the signaling efficiency or amplification capacity of the system. The equation becomes:\n    $$ E = \\frac{E_{\\max} \\cdot \\tau \\cdot f}{1 + \\tau \\cdot f} $$\n    Dividing by $E_{\\max}$ gives the normalized effect as a function of fractional occupancy $f$ and transducer ratio $\\tau$:\n    $$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{\\tau \\cdot f}{1 + \\tau \\cdot f} $$\n\n2.  **Calculation of Fractional Occupancy for Half-Maximal Response**\n\n    We need to find the fractional occupancy $f$ when the effect is half-maximal ($\\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{1}{2}$) and the transducer ratio is $\\tau = 9$.

Our result shows that a half-maximal effect is achieved when only $\\frac{1}{9}$ (approximately $11\\%$) of the receptors are occupied. Since $f=\\frac{1}{9}$ is much less than $0.5$, this indicates a high degree of signal amplification and the presence of a significant **receptor reserve** (or spare receptors) in the system.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and analysis of a pharmacodynamic (PD) indirect response model where a drug inhibits the production of a response mediator.\n\nFirst, we establish the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the amount of the response mediator, $R(t)$. The rate of change of $R(t)$, denoted $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of production (input) and the rate of loss (output).\n\nThe rate of production is given as a zero-order process with rate constant $k_{\\text{in}}$. This production is inhibited by a drug with a constant concentration $C$. The inhibitory effect is described by a maximum inhibitory effect ($I_{\\max}$) model, where the fractional inhibition is given by the function $I(C)$:\n$$I(C) = \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot C}{IC_{50} + C}$$\nThe inhibited rate of production is therefore $k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C))$.\n\nThe rate of loss is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\text{out}}$. This rate is proportional to the current amount of the mediator, so the rate of loss is $k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R(t)$.\n\nCombining these, the mass-balance ODE is:\n$$\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C)) - k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R(t)$$\n\nNext, we determine the initial condition, $R(0)$. The problem states that prior to drug administration ($t < 0$), the system is at a drug-free steady state (baseline). In this state, $C=0$, so $I(C) = I(0) = 0$. At steady state, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$. Let the baseline response be $R_{base}$. The ODE becomes:\n$$0 = k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - 0) - k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R_{base}$$\nSolving for $R_{base}$ gives:\n$$R_{base} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}}$$\nSince the amount of the mediator $R$ cannot change instantaneously, the initial condition at $t=0$ is $R(0) = R_{base}$.\n\nNow we solve the ODE for $t \\ge 0$ with the constant drug concentration $C$. The ODE can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ODE:\n$$\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} + k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R(t) = k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C))$$\nThe right-hand side is constant for a given $C$. The general solution to this type of equation is the sum of a particular solution and the homogeneous solution.\nThe particular solution is the new steady state under the drug's influence, which we denote as $R_{ss,C}$. At this new steady state, $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$:\n$$0 = k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C)) - k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R_{ss,C}$$\nSolving for $R_{ss,C}$ yields:\n$$R_{ss,C} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C))}{k_{\\text{out}}} = R_{base} \\cdot (1 - I(C))$$\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{dR}{dt} + k_{\\text{out}} \\cdot R(t) = 0$, which has the solution $A\\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t)$ for some constant $A$.\nThe full solution is therefore:\n$$R(t) = R_{ss,C} + A \\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t)$$\nWe find the constant $A$ using the initial condition $R(0) = R_{base}$:\n$$R(0) = R_{ss,C} + A \\exp(0) = R_{ss,C} + A$$\n$$A = R(0) - R_{ss,C} = R_{base} - R_{ss,C}$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the general solution gives the explicit time course for the response mediator:\n$$R(t) = R_{ss,C} + (R_{base} - R_{ss,C}) \\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t)$$\n\nNow we can compute the two requested quantities using the given parameter values: $k_{\\text{in}} = 50$ units$\\cdot$h$^{-1}$, $k_{\\text{out}} = 0.2$ h$^{-1}$, $I_{\\max} = 0.9$, $IC_{50} = 2$ mg$\\cdot$L$^{-1}$, and $C = 4$ mg$\\cdot$L$^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the necessary intermediate values:\n$$R_{base} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}} = \\frac{50}{0.2} = 250 \\text{ units}$$\n$$I(C) = \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot C}{IC_{50} + C} = \\frac{0.9 \\cdot 4}{2 + 4} = \\frac{3.6}{6} = 0.6$$\n$$R_{ss,C} = R_{base} \\cdot (1 - I(C)) = 250 \\cdot (1 - 0.6) = 250 \\cdot 0.4 = 100 \\text{ units}$$\n\nThe first quantity is the time at which the mediator has achieved $95\\%$ of its total asymptotic change. The total change is from $R_{base}$ to $R_{ss,C}$. The change at time $t$ is $R(t) - R_{base}$. The total asymptotic change is $R_{ss,C} - R_{base}$. We seek the time $t_{95\\%}$ such that:\n$$R(t_{95\\%}) - R_{base} = 0.95 \\cdot (R_{ss,C} - R_{base})$$\nFrom our solution for $R(t)$, we can write:\n$$R(t) - R_{base} = (R_{ss,C} - R_{base}) - (R_{ss,C} - R_{base})\\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t) = (R_{ss,C} - R_{base})(1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t))$$\nEquating the two expressions for the change at $t_{95\\%}$:\n$$(R_{ss,C} - R_{base})(1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t_{95\\%})) = 0.95 \\cdot (R_{ss,C} - R_{base})$$\nAssuming $R_{ss,C} \\neq R_{base}$, we can divide by this term:\n$$1 - \\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t_{95\\%}) = 0.95$$\n$$\\exp(-k_{\\text{out}}t_{95\\%}) = 0.05$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-k_{\\text{out}}t_{95\\%} = \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$t_{95\\%} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{k_{\\text{out}}}$$\nSubstituting the value for $k_{\\text{out}}$:\n$$t_{95\\%} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{0.2} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{0.2} \\approx \\frac{2.99573227}{0.2} \\approx 14.978661 \\text{ h}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the time is $14.98$ hours.\n\nThe second quantity is the fractional suppression of $R$ at steady state relative to baseline. This is defined as the reduction in $R$ from baseline divided by the baseline value.\n$$\\text{Fractional Suppression} = \\frac{R_{base} - R_{ss,C}}{R_{base}} = 1 - \\frac{R_{ss,C}}{R_{base}}$$\nUsing our expressions for $R_{base}$ and $R_{ss,C}$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Suppression} = 1 - \\frac{R_{base} \\cdot (1 - I(C))}{R_{base}} = 1 - (1 - I(C)) = I(C)$$\nThus, the fractional suppression at steady state is simply equal to the fractional inhibition of the production rate, $I(C)$.\nUsing our previously calculated value for $I(C)$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Suppression} = 0.6$$\nAs a decimal fraction expressed to four significant figures, this is $0.6000$.\n\nThe two final values are the time to $95\\%$ of steady-state effect, $14.98$ hours, and the fractional suppression at steady state, $0.6000$.",
