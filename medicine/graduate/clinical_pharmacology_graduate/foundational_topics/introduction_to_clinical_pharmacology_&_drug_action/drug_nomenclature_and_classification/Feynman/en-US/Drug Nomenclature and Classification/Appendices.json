While stems like \"-olol\" for beta-blockers are well-known, the system includes meaningful variants that encode additional mechanistic details. This exercise  challenges you to apply the principles of INN classification to a real-world example, demonstrating why understanding these nuances is critical for accurate drug grouping in clinical informatics.",

            "problem": "A hospital informatics team is building a rules-based medication filter in an Electronic Health Record (EHR) that uses International Nonproprietary Names (INN) stems to group drugs by pharmacologic class. The team notices that most beta-adrenoceptor antagonists share the INN stem “-olol,” but carvedilol ends with “-ilol.” They are unsure whether their query that selects names ending in “-olol” will capture carvedilol appropriately for beta-blocker alerts and clinical decision support.\n\nUsing the following fundamental base:\n- In clinical pharmacology, classification by mechanism of action is grounded in receptor theory: drugs are grouped by their primary target(s) and the direction of effect (agonism or antagonism) on those targets.\n- The International Nonproprietary Names (INN) stem system encodes pharmacologic class information in drug names; stems and recognized stem variants are designed to reflect shared mechanisms across a class, providing a standardized, historically curated naming convention for mapping and inference.\n\nEvaluate whether carvedilol should be stem-associated with beta blockers for the purposes of this filter, and select the best justification grounded in both mechanism and the historical INN stem conventions.\n\nA.

            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- An EHR medication filter is being built to group drugs by pharmacologic class using International Nonproprietary Names (INN) stems.\n- The target class is beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, which typically share the INN stem \"-olol\".\n- A specific drug, carvedilol, ends with \"-ilol\", creating uncertainty for a filter designed to select names ending in \"-olol\".\n- The task is to evaluate whether carvedilol should be stem-associated with beta blockers.\n- The evaluation must be based on two provided principles:\n    1.  **Mechanism of Action:** Drugs are classified based on their primary molecular target(s) and their effect (e.g., agonism, antagonism).\n    2.  **INN Stem System:** This system encodes pharmacologic class information in drug names, with stems and recognized stem variants reflecting shared mechanisms.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded (Critical):** The problem is scientifically sound. It is based on established principles of clinical pharmacology, including receptor theory and the standardized nomenclature system of the World Health Organization (WHO) for International Nonproprietary Names (INN). The example of carvedilol and the \"-olol\" stem is a classic and accurate illustration of a real-world issue in pharmacoinformatics and drug classification.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides clear foundational principles and a specific question that can be answered by applying these principles to the given case. A unique and logical conclusion can be derived.\n- **Objective (Critical):** The language is objective and precise. It describes a technical problem without any subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n\nThe problem statement is free of scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, ambiguity, or any other listed flaw. It presents a valid, formalizable question rooted in established scientific convention.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by applying the provided principles.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to classify carvedilol according to its mechanism of action and the conventions of the INN stem system.\n\n1.  **Analysis based on Mechanism of Action:**\n    The first principle states that classification is based on mechanism. The established mechanism of action for carvedilol is that it is a non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, meaning it blocks both $\\beta_1$- and $\\beta_2$-adrenergic receptors. Additionally, it is an antagonist at $\\alpha_1$-adrenergic receptors. This dual action classifies it as a mixed $\\alpha/\\beta$ adrenergic antagonist. Because it possesses significant, clinically relevant beta-blocking activity, it is unequivocally a member of the beta-blocker class, albeit a specific subtype. Its use in treating heart failure, an indication for which beta-blockade is the essential mechanism, confirms its identity as a beta-blocker.\n\n2.  **Analysis based on INN Stem System Conventions:**\n    The second principle states that the INN stem system encodes this mechanistic information. The stem for beta-adrenoceptor antagonists is \"-olol\". The problem correctly notes carvedilol ends in \"-ilol\". According to the official documentation and historical development of the INN system, specific variations on the \"-olol\" stem were intentionally created to denote subclasses. The stem \"-alol\" was established for mixed $\\alpha$- and $\\beta$-blockers, with the prototype being labetalol. Carvedilol, which shares this mixed mechanism, was assigned the name using the \"-ilol\" ending, which is recognized as a variant within the broader \"-olol\" family. Therefore, the \"-ilol\" suffix is not an error or an exception but rather a deliberate and informative part of the nomenclature, signaling its specific mixed-antagonist properties while preserving its identity as part of the larger beta-blocker group.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on both its mechanism of action (significant $\\beta$-antagonism) and the established rules of the INN stem system (where \"-ilol\" is a recognized variant of \"-olol\" for mixed antagonists), carvedilol must be classified as a beta-blocker. An EHR filter based on INN stems must be designed to recognize \"-ilol\" and \"-alol\" as variants belonging to the \"-olol\" class to function correctly.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Carvedilol should be included with beta blockers: it antagonizes $\\beta_1/\\beta_2$ receptors and also $\\alpha_1$ receptors; historically, INN recognizes “-alol” and “-ilol” as variant stems within the “-olol” beta-blocker family to denote mixed $\\alpha/\\beta$ antagonists (e.g., labetalol, carvedilol), so the stem association is preserved despite the “-ilol” ending.**\n- This option correctly identifies the mechanism of action of carvedilol as a mixed antagonist at $\\beta_1/\\beta_2$ and $\\alpha_1$ receptors. It accurately describes the INN convention where \"-alol\" and \"-ilol\" are recognized variants of the \"-olol\" stem that denote this specific mixed-action subclass. The conclusion that the stem association is preserved is correct and follows directly from the application of the given principles.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Carvedilol should be excluded from beta blockers: only drugs terminating exactly in “-olol” are beta blockers; “-ilol” indicates absence of $\\beta$ activity, and carvedilol is best regarded solely as a vasodilator unrelated to $\\beta$ blockade.**\n- This statement is factually incorrect. First, the INN system explicitly includes variants like \"-alol\". Second, the assertion that \"-ilol\" indicates an absence of $\\beta$ activity is false; carvedilol is a potent beta-blocker. Third, its vasodilator effect (from $\\alpha_1$ blockade) does not negate its clinically crucial beta-blocking effect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Carvedilol should be included, but only as a historical accident of naming: the INN stem family carries no mechanistic content, and carvedilol’s classification as a beta blocker is justified exclusively by its antioxidant properties rather than receptor antagonism.**\n- This statement is fundamentally flawed. It claims the naming is an accident, which is false. It directly contradicts the provided principle that the INN stem system *does* carry mechanistic content. Furthermore, while carvedilol possesses antioxidant properties, its primary classification and therapeutic mechanism as a beta-blocker are based on receptor antagonism, not its antioxidant effects.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Carvedilol should be excluded from beta blockers and grouped exclusively with $\\alpha_1$ antagonists: its antihypertensive effect is mediated only by $\\alpha_1$ blockade at therapeutic exposures, rendering $\\beta$ antagonism clinically irrelevant for classification.**\n- This statement is incorrect. The antihypertensive effect of carvedilol is a result of both $\\alpha_1$ blockade (vasodilation) and $\\beta$ blockade (reduced cardiac output, renin suppression). Most importantly, the claim that its $\\beta$ antagonism is \"clinically irrelevant\" is dangerously false. The mortality benefit of carvedilol in chronic heart failure is directly attributed to its beta-blocking activity. This activity is of paramount clinical relevance.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "problem": "A hypothetical immediate-release oral drug candidate, AX-417, is being assessed for a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) designation and the potential for a BCS-based biowaiver for in vivo bioequivalence. AX-417 is a monoprotic weak base with an acid dissociation constant $pK_a = 7.8$. The highest proposed market strength is a tablet containing $D = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ AX-417. Equilibrium thermodynamic solubility was measured at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ in compendial buffers at $pH = 1.2$, $4.5$, and $6.8$ and found to be:\n- $C_s(pH\\,1.2) = 40\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$,\n- $C_s(pH\\,4.5) = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$,\n- $C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\nNo chemical degradation in gastrointestinal fluids was observed across the $pH$ range $1$ to $7.5$, and no complexation with bile salts was detected.\n\nA human radiolabeled mass-balance study reported $6\\%$ of the oral dose recovered as unchanged AX-417 in feces.

BCS Class I; a BCS-based biowaiver is not justified because the absolute bioavailability is less than $85\\%$.\n\nD. BCS Class III; a BCS-based biowaiver is justified.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a determination of the Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class for the drug candidate AX-417 and an assessment of the justification for a BCS-based biowaiver for an immediate-release tablet formulation. This will be accomplished through a systematic application of established BCS principles and regulatory criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\nThe problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, completeness, and consistency.\n\n**1.1. Extracted Givens:**\n- Drug: AX-417, oral immediate-release (IR)\n- Chemical nature: Monoprotic weak base\n- Acid dissociation constant: $pK_a = 7.8$\n- Highest proposed market strength (dose): $D = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$\n- Equilibrium solubility ($37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$):\n  - $C_s(pH\\,1.2) = 40\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n  - $C_s(pH\\,4.5) = 8\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n  - $C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$\n- Stability: No chemical degradation in gastrointestinal fluids over $pH = 1$ to $7.5$.\n- Interactions: No complexation with bile salts detected.\n- Mass Balance: $6\\%$ of oral dose recovered as unchanged AX-417 in feces.\n- Bioavailability: Absolute oral bioavailability is $50\\%$, due to extensive first-pass metabolism.\n- Permeability (in vitro): Caco-2 apparent permeability, $P_{\\mathrm{app}} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, similar to metoprolol.\n- Formulations: Test and reference IR tablets are qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar in excipients.\n- Dissolution: Both formulations release $\\ge 85\\%$ of the labeled amount by $15\\,\\mathrm{min}$ in $900\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of media at $pH \\approx 1.2$, $4.5$, and $6.8$ (USP Apparatus $2$, $50\\,\\mathrm{rpm}$, $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Safety/PK: Not a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drug; exhibits dose-proportional pharmacokinetics.\n- Excipients: Do not modulate gastrointestinal motility or membrane permeability.\n\n**1.2. Validation against Criteria:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, utilizing standard concepts and terminology from pharmacology and pharmaceutics (BCS, $pK_a$, solubility, permeability, dissolution, biowaiver). The provided data are internally consistent: as a weak base with $pK_a=7.8$, its solubility correctly decreases as $pH$ increases from $1.2$ to $6.8$. The data are sufficient to perform the required classification and assessment. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains no scientific or logical flaws.\n\n**1.3. Verdict:**\nThe problem statement is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Step 2: BCS Classification\n\nThe BCS class is determined by the drug's aqueous solubility and intestinal permeability.\n\n**2.1. Solubility Classification:**\nAccording to regulatory guidelines (e.g., FDA), a drug substance is considered **Highly Soluble** if its highest single therapeutic dose is completely soluble in $250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ or less of aqueous media over the pH range of $1$ to $6.8$ at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\n- Highest dose, $D = 400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Test volume, $V = 250\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- The required minimum solubility, $C_{s,req}$, to dissolve the dose in this volume is:\n$$ C_{s,req} = \\frac{D}{V} = \\frac{400\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{250\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\n- To be classified as highly soluble, the drug's equilibrium solubility must be greater than or equal to $C_{s,req}$ at the \"worst-case\" $pH$ within the range of $1$ to $6.8$. For a weak base, solubility is lowest at the highest $pH$.\n- The provided data points cover the required range. The lowest solubility is observed at the highest $pH$ tested, $pH = 6.8$.\n- The measured solubility at $pH=6.8$ is $C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$.\n- Comparing the measured minimum solubility to the required solubility:\n$$ C_s(pH\\,6.8) = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} \\ge C_{s,req} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL} $$\n- Since the condition is met, AX-417 is classified as **Highly Soluble**.\n\n**2.2. Permeability Classification:**\nA drug substance is considered **Highly Permeable** when the extent of absorption in humans is determined to be $\\ge 85\\%$ of an administered dose, based on mass-balance studies or comparison to an appropriate reference drug.\n\n- The human radiolabeled mass-balance study provides the most direct evidence for the extent of absorption. It reported that $6\\%$ of the oral dose was recovered as unchanged drug in feces.\n- The fraction of the dose that remains unabsorbed is equal to the fraction recovered as unchanged drug in feces.\n- Fraction Unabsorbed $= 6\\% = 0.06$.\n- The extent of absorption ($F_a$) is therefore:\n$$ F_a = 1 - (\\text{fraction unchanged in feces}) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94 $$\n- This corresponds to an extent of absorption of $94\\%$.\n- The criterion for high permeability is $F_a \\ge 85\\%$. Since $94\\% \\ge 85\\%$, AX-417 is classified as **Highly Permeable**.\n- The low absolute bioavailability of $50\\%$ is explicitly attributed to extensive first-pass metabolism, which occurs *after* the drug has been absorbed from the gastrointestinal lumen. Absolute bioavailability is not the metric for permeability classification under BCS guidelines.\n- The in vitro Caco-2 data, $P_{\\mathrm{app}} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s}$, which is similar to that of the high-permeability standard metoprolol, further corroborates the high permeability classification.\n\n**2.3. BCS Class Conclusion:**\n- Solubility: High\n- Permeability: High\n- Therefore, AX-417 is a **BCS Class I** drug.\n\n### Step 3: Biowaiver Justification\n\nA BCS-based biowaiver for an immediate-release solid oral dosage form is considered based on its BCS class and formulation characteristics. For a **BCS Class I** drug, the criteria are as follows:\n\n1.  **Drug Classification:** The drug must be BCS Class I. This is met.\n2.  **Dissolution:** The IR product must be **Very Rapidly Dissolving**, which is defined as $\\ge 85\\%$ release in $15$ minutes in all three standard media ($0.1\\,\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{HCl}$, $pH=4.5$ buffer, and $pH=6.8$ buffer). The problem states that both test and reference formulations meet this criterion. This is met.\n3.  **Excipients:** Excipients must be well-established and should not affect absorption. The problem states the test and reference formulations are qualitatively the same and quantitatively similar, and contain no excipients known to modulate GI motility or permeability. This is met.\n4.  **Therapeutic Index:** The drug should not be a narrow therapeutic index (NTI) drug. The problem states this is the case. This is met.\n\nSince all criteria for a BCS Class I-based biowaiver are fulfilled, a biowaiver is **justified**.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. BCS Class I; a BCS-based biowaiver is justified.**\n  This option correctly identifies AX-417 as a BCS Class I drug and correctly concludes that a biowaiver is justified based on the provided dissolution and formulation data. This aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n  **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. BCS Class II; a BCS-based biowaiver is not justified.**\n  This option incorrectly classifies the drug as BCS Class II (Low Solubility, High Permeability). As demonstrated, the drug is highly soluble.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. BCS Class I; a BCS-based biowaiver is not justified because the absolute bioavailability is less than 85%.**\n  This option correctly identifies the drug as BCS Class I, but incorrectly states that a biowaiver is not justified. The reasoning provided is fundamentally flawed: permeability classification is based on the extent of absorption ($F_a$), not absolute bioavailability ($F_{abs}$). Low bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism does not disqualify a highly permeable drug from a biowaiver.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. BCS Class III; a BCS-based biowaiver is justified.**\n  This option incorrectly classifies the drug as BCS Class III (High Solubility, Low Permeability). As demonstrated, the drug is highly permeable.\n  **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis, only option A is correct.",

            "problem": "A hospital formulary committee is harmonizing product strength expressions between oral and parenteral ampicillin products, guided by nomenclature and classification principles in clinical pharmacology.

For dose equivalence across products, the committee wants to know how many milligrams of ampicillin base are present in the $500$ mg of ampicillin sodium.\n\nUsing scientifically grounded principles, begin from the definitions that (i) the number of moles $n$ of a substance equals its mass $m$ divided by its molecular weight $M$, and (ii) for a simple $1:1$ acid–base salt where one counterion replaces one proton, one mole of the salt contains one mole of the active moiety.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on fundamental stoichiometric principles and addresses a legitimate and critical issue in clinical pharmacology and medication safety. All necessary data are provided, and the task is to derive and calculate a quantity and discuss its implications based on established conventions. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation and calculation of the mass of ampicillin base, and second, the articulation of the labeling implications.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Ampicillin Base Mass**\n\nThe analysis begins from the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  The number of moles, $n$, of a substance is defined as its mass, $m$, divided by its molar mass (or molecular weight), $M$.\n    $$n = \\frac{m}{M}$$\n\n2.  For a simple $1:1$ salt, one mole of the salt yields one mole of the active moiety (in this case, the free base) upon dissociation.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{salt}}$ and $M_{\\text{salt}}$ represent the mass and molecular weight of ampicillin sodium, respectively. Let $m_{\\text{base}}$ and $M_{\\text{base}}$ represent the mass and molecular weight of the ampicillin base. The given values are:\n-   Mass of ampicillin sodium, $m_{\\text{salt}} = 500$ mg.\n-   Molecular weight of ampicillin sodium, $M_{\\text{salt}} = 371.39$ g/mol.\n-   Molecular weight of ampicillin base, $M_{\\text{base}} = 349.40$ g/mol.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the number of moles of ampicillin sodium, $n_{\\text{salt}}$, present in the $500$ mg sample. Using the definition from principle (i):\n$$n_{\\text{salt}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{salt}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nIt is noted that mass is in milligrams and molecular weight is in grams per mole. The conversion factor will cancel out, so we can proceed, but for rigor, we would convert mass to grams: $m_{\\text{salt}} = 0.500$ g.\n$$n_{\\text{salt}} = \\frac{0.500 \\text{ g}}{371.39 \\text{ g/mol}}$$\n\nAccording to principle (ii), the molar relationship between the salt and the active base is $1:1$. Therefore, the number of moles of ampicillin base, $n_{\\text{base}}$, is equal to the number of moles of ampicillin sodium, $n_{\\text{salt}}$.\n$$n_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{salt}}$$\n\nTo find the mass of the ampicillin base, $m_{\\text{base}}$, we rearrange the molar definition from principle (i):\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{base}} \\times M_{\\text{base}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the preceding relationships to derive a single comprehensive expression.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = n_{\\text{salt}} \\times M_{\\text{base}} = \\left( \\frac{m_{\\text{salt}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}} \\right) \\times M_{\\text{base}}$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = m_{\\text{salt}} \\times \\frac{M_{\\text{base}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nThis is the required relationship. The ratio $\\frac{M_{\\text{base}}}{M_{\\text{salt}}}$ is a dimensionless conversion factor, often referred to as the salt factor, which directly converts the mass of the salt to the equivalent mass of the active base.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values into this derived equation to calculate the mass of the ampicillin base.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 500 \\text{ mg} \\times \\frac{349.40 \\text{ g/mol}}{371.39 \\text{ g/mol}}$$\nThe units of g/mol cancel, leaving the result in mg.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 500 \\times \\frac{349.40}{371.39} \\text{ mg} \\approx 500 \\times 0.9408169... \\text{ mg}$$\n$$m_{\\text{base}} \\approx 470.40845... \\text{ mg}$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to four significant figures.\nThe first four significant figures are $4$, $7$, $0$, and $4$. The fifth digit is $0$, so no rounding up is required.\n$$m_{\\text{base}} = 470.4 \\text{ mg}$$\nThus, a vial containing $500$ mg of ampicillin sodium provides a dose equivalent to $470.4$ mg of ampicillin base.\n\n**Part 2: Labeling Implications and Pharmacopoeial Conventions**\n\nThe discrepancy between expressing drug strength based on the salt form versus the active moiety has significant clinical and safety implications.\n\n1.  **Risk of Medication Errors**: As calculated, $500$ mg of ampicillin sodium is not equivalent to $500$ mg of ampicillin base; it delivers approximately 6% less active drug. If a clinician were to switch a patient from oral ampicillin capsules dosed at $500$ mg (base) to an intravenous form, and incorrectly assumed that a \"$500$ mg\" vial of ampicillin sodium provided an equivalent dose, the patient would be underdosed. Conversely, correctly targeting an IV dose of $500$ mg of ampicillin base would require administering $500 \\text{ mg} / 0.9408... \\approx 531.5$ mg of the sodium salt. Inconsistent labeling across different dosage forms of the same drug creates a high risk of such calculation errors, potentially leading to therapeutic failure (underdosing) or increased risk of toxicity (overdosing).\n\n2.  **Pharmacopoeial and Regulatory Conventions**: To mitigate this risk, major pharmacopoeias and regulatory bodies strongly advocate for standardizing the expression of drug strength. The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) promote labeling based on the active moiety. The active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance, excluding appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt, or other noncovalent derivative.\n\n3.  **Clarity and Therapeutic Equivalence**: By expressing the strength of all product forms (e.g., capsules, tablets, injections) in terms of the active moiety, dose equivalence is made explicit. A \"$500$ mg\" dose of ampicillin would refer to $500$ mg of the active ampicillin molecule, regardless of whether it is administered as the free acid, sodium salt, or another derivative like ampicillin trihydrate. This harmonization simplifies prescribing, dispensing, and administration, thereby enhancing patient safety by removing the need for manual conversions by healthcare professionals at the point of care.\n\nFor the hospital formulary committee, these principles lead to a clear recommendation. To ensure patient safety and align with best practices, the formulary's electronic systems and records should be harmonized. The strength of the ampicillin sodium vial should be recorded and displayed not as \"$500$ mg of ampicillin sodium,\" but as being equivalent to \"$470.4$ mg of ampicillin base.\" This allows for safe and direct therapeutic interchange between oral and parenteral formulations.",
