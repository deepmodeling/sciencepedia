A biochemical reaction is represented by stoichiometric coefficients that count how many molecules of each species are consumed or produced per reaction event.

The stoichiometric incidence matrix $S$ has rows indexed by species and columns indexed by reactions, with entries equal to these signed stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nSeparately, the directed graph on species has an adjacency matrix $A$ whose entry $A_{ij}$ is $1$ if there exists at least one reaction in which species $i$ is a reactant and species $j$ is a product, and $0$ otherwise.

            "problem": "A three-tier signaling cascade in a clinical pharmacology context is modeled by three sequential, linearized first-order modules with strictly positive time constants $\\tau_1$, $\\tau_2$, and $\\tau_3$ (units: minutes), and static gains $K_1$, $K_2$, and $K_3$ (dimensionless). The cascade is closed by a negative feedback from the output back to the input with feedback strength $F$ (dimensionless), representing homeostatic regulation. A drug acting on the second tier reduces its gain by a fraction $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, so that $K_2$ is replaced by $K_2(1-\\alpha)$.\n\nUnder standard linear time-invariant (LTI) assumptions, the closed-loop characteristic equation for the cascade can be written as a cubic in the complex frequency $s$ whose coefficients depend on $\\tau_1$, $\\tau_2$, $\\tau_3$, $F$, $K_1$, $K_2$, $K_3$, and $\\alpha$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the stability of a closed-loop signaling cascade, which is modeled as a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. The stability of an LTI system is determined by the locations of the roots of its characteristic equation in the complex frequency plane. For a system to be stable, all roots (poles of the closed-loop transfer function) must lie in the left half of the complex plane, meaning they must all have strictly negative real parts. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion provides a method to determine whether this condition is met without explicitly calculating the roots.\n\nFirst, we establish the characteristic equation for the given system. The system consists of a forward path with three sequential first-order modules and a negative feedback loop. The transfer function of a first-order module with gain $K$ and time constant $\\tau$ is $G(s) = \\frac{K}{1+\\tau s}$.\n\nThe forward path is the product of the transfer functions of the three tiers. The gain of the second tier is modified by the drug, becoming $K_2(1-\\alpha)$. The forward path transfer function, $G_F(s)$, is therefore:\n$$G_F(s) = \\left(\\frac{K_1}{1+\\tau_1 s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_2(1-\\alpha)}{1+\\tau_2 s}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_3}{1+\\tau_3 s}\\right) = \\frac{K_1 K_2 K_3 (1-\\alpha)}{(1+\\tau_1 s)(1+\\tau_2 s)(1+\\tau_3 s)}$$\nThe feedback path has a transfer function $H(s) = F$. For a negative feedback system, the closed-loop transfer function is $G_{CL}(s) = \\frac{G_F(s)}{1+G_F(s)H(s)}$. The characteristic equation is the denominator of $G_{CL}(s)$ set to zero:\n$$1 + G_F(s)H(s) = 0$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $G_F(s)$ and $H(s)$:\n$$1 + \\frac{K_1 K_2 K_3 F (1-\\alpha)}{(1+\\tau_1 s)(1+\\tau_2 s)(1+\\tau_3 s)} = 0$$\nTo obtain the polynomial form, we multiply by the denominator:\n$$(1+\\tau_1 s)(1+\\tau_2 s)(1+\\tau_3 s) + K_1 K_2 K_3 F (1-\\alpha) = 0$$\nExpanding the product of the first-order terms:\n$$(\\tau_1\\tau_2\\tau_3)s^3 + (\\tau_1\\tau_2 + \\tau_1\\tau_3 + \\tau_2\\tau_3)s^2 + (\\tau_1+\\tau_2+\\tau_3)s + 1 + K_1 K_2 K_3 F (1-\\alpha) = 0$$\nThis is a third-order polynomial in $s$ of the general form $a_3 s^3 + a_2 s^2 + a_1 s + a_0 = 0$, where:\n$a_3 = \\tau_1\\tau_2\\tau_3$\n$a_2 = \\tau_1\\tau_2 + \\tau_1\\tau_3 + \\tau_2\\tau_3$\n$a_1 = \\tau_1+\\tau_2+\\tau_3$\n$a_0 = 1 + K_1 K_2 K_3 F (1-\\alpha)$\n\nNext, as per the problem's instructions, we derive the Routh-Hurwitz stability conditions for this cubic polynomial using the Routh array. The array is constructed as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\ns^3 & a_3 & a_1 \\\\\ns^2 & a_2 & a_0 \\\\\ns^1 & b_1 & 0 \\\\\ns^0 & c_1 & 0\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe elements $b_1$ and $c_1$ are calculated as:\n$b_1 = \\frac{a_2 a_1 - a_3 a_0}{a_2}$\n$c_1 = \\frac{b_1 a_0 - a_2(0)}{b_1} = a_0$\n\nFor the system to be stable, all roots must have negative real parts. The Routh-Hurwitz criterion states that this is true if and only if all elements in the first column of the Routh array ($a_3, a_2, b_1, c_1$) have the same sign. Since the time constants $\\tau_i$ are strictly positive, $a_3 = \\tau_1\\tau_2\\tau_3 > 0$. Thus, all first-column elements must be positive for stability.\nThe conditions are:\n1. $a_2 > 0$\n2. $b_1 > 0$\n3. $c_1 > 0$\n\nLet's analyze these conditions.\n1. $a_2 = \\tau_1\\tau_2 + \\tau_1\\tau_3 + \\tau_2\\tau_3$. Since all $\\tau_i > 0$, $a_2$ is guaranteed to be positive.\n2. $c_1 = a_0$. Thus, we must have $a_0 > 0$.\n3. $b_1 > 0 \\implies \\frac{a_2 a_1 - a_3 a_0}{a_2} > 0$. Since $a_2 > 0$, this simplifies to the critical condition: $a_2 a_1 - a_3 a_0 > 0$, or $a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$.\n(Note: The condition $a_1 > 0$ is also necessary, which is true as $a_1=\\tau_1+\\tau_2+\\tau_3 > 0$).\nSo, the necessary and sufficient conditions for stability of the cubic system are $a_0 > 0$ and $a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$.\n\nNow, we apply these conditions to the specific system using the given parameters:\n$\\tau_1 = 20\\ \\mathrm{min}$, $\\tau_2 = 5\\ \\mathrm{min}$, $\\tau_3 = 2\\ \\mathrm{min}$\n$K_1 = 3$, $K_2 = 2$, $K_3 = 5$, $F = 1$\n$\\alpha \\in [0,1]$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values of the coefficients:\n$a_3 = 20 \\times 5 \\times 2 = 200$\n$a_2 = (20 \\times 5) + (20 \\times 2) + (5 \\times 2) = 100 + 40 + 10 = 150$\n$a_1 = 20 + 5 + 2 = 27$\n$a_0 = 1 + (3 \\times 2 \\times 5 \\times 1)(1-\\alpha) = 1 + 30(1-\\alpha) = 1 + 30 - 30\\alpha = 31 - 30\\alpha$\n\nLet's check the stability conditions.\nFirst condition: $a_0 > 0$.\n$31 - 30\\alpha > 0 \\implies 31 > 30\\alpha \\implies \\alpha < \\frac{31}{30} \\approx 1.033$.\nSince the problem states $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, this condition is always satisfied.\n\nSecond, and more restrictive, condition: $a_2 a_1 > a_3 a_0$.\n$150 \\times 27 > 200 \\times (31 - 30\\alpha)$\n$4050 > 200 \\times (31 - 30\\alpha)$\nDividing by $50$:\n$81 > 4 \\times (31 - 30\\alpha)$\n$81 > 124 - 120\\alpha$\n$120\\alpha > 124 - 81$\n$120\\alpha > 43$\n$\\alpha > \\frac{43}{120}$\n\nThe system is stable if and only if $\\alpha > \\frac{43}{120}$. The problem asks for the minimum inhibition fraction, $\\alpha_{\\min}$, required to ensure stability. This corresponds to the boundary of the stability region. At this boundary value, the system is marginally stable. Therefore, the minimum value that defines the threshold for stability is:\n$\\alpha_{\\min} = \\frac{43}{120}$\n\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$\\alpha_{\\min} = \\frac{43}{120} \\approx 0.358333...$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$\\alpha_{\\min} \\approx 0.3583$\nThis is the minimum inhibition fraction required to bring the system from an unstable or marginally stable state (when $\\alpha$ is small) into a stable state.",
