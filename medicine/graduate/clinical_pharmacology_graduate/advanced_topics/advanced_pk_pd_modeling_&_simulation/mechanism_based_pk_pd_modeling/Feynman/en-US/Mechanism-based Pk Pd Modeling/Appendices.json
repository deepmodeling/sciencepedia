A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the relationship between effect and concentration, and second, the calculation of the specific concentration required to achieve an $80\\%$ maximal effect.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Functional Relationship\n\nWe begin with the law of mass action for the reversible binding of a drug (agonist) $D$ to a receptor $R$. The problem states that cooperativity is summarized by the Hill coefficient $n$. This can be represented by the reaction:\n$$ nD + R \\rightleftharpoons D_nR $$\nwhere $D_nR$ is the drug-receptor complex. At equilibrium, the dissociation constant, which we denote here as $K_A^n$ to match the form related to $EC_{50}$, is given by:\n$$ K_A^n = \\frac{[D]^n [R]}{[D_nR]} $$\nLet $C$ be the concentration of the free drug, so $[D] = C$.\n$$ K_A^n = \\frac{C^n [R]}{[D_nR]} $$\nThe total receptor concentration, $R_{tot}$, is the sum of free receptors $[R]$ and occupied receptors $[D_nR]$:\n$$ R_{tot} = [R] + [D_nR] $$\nThe fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is the ratio of occupied receptors to the total number of receptors:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{R_{tot}} = \\frac{[D_nR]}{[R] + [D_nR]} $$\nTo express $\\theta$ as a function of $C$, we first rearrange the dissociation constant expression to solve for $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_A^n [D_nR]}{C^n} $$\nSubstitute this into the denominator of the expression for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{\\frac{K_A^n [D_nR]}{C^n} + [D_nR]} $$\nFactoring out $[D_nR]$ from the denominator, we get:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{[D_nR]}{[D_nR] \\left( \\frac{K_A^n}{C^n} + 1 \\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_A^n}{C^n} + 1} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $C^n$ yields the final form for fractional occupancy:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{C^n}{K_A^n + C^n} $$\nThe problem states there is a linear transduction from receptor occupancy to effect. This implies that the effect $E$ is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy $\\theta$. The maximal effect $E_{\\max}$ is achieved when occupancy is complete ($\\theta = 1$). Thus:\n$$ E = E_{\\max} \\cdot \\theta $$\nThis gives the relationship for the fractional effect:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\theta = \\frac{C^n}{K_A^n + C^n} $$\nNext, we use the definition of $EC_{50}$. $EC_{50}$ is the concentration $C$ at which the effect is half of its maximum, i.e., $E = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\max}$. This corresponds to a fractional effect of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Setting $C=EC_{50}$ and $E/E_{\\max} = 1/2$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{(EC_{50})^n}{K_A^n + (EC_{50})^n} $$\nSolving for $K_A^n$:\n$$ K_A^n + (EC_{50})^n = 2 (EC_{50})^n $$\n$$ K_A^n = (EC_{50})^n $$\nThis result connects the mechanistic dissociation constant to the empirical parameter $EC_{50}$. Substituting $K_A^n = (EC_{50})^n$ back into the fractional effect equation gives the required functional relationship, known as the Sigmoid Emax model or the Hill equation:\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = \\frac{C^n}{(EC_{50})^n + C^n} $$\n\n#### Part 2: Calculation of the Concentration\n\nWe are asked to find the concentration $C$ that produces an effect equal to $0.8\\,E_{\\max}$. This means the fractional effect $E/E_{\\max}$ is $0.8$. We use the derived equation with the given numerical values for the parameters.\n$$ \\frac{E}{E_{\\max}} = 0.8 $$\nSubstituting this into the Hill equation:\n$$ 0.8 = \\frac{C^n}{(EC_{50})^n + C^n} $$\nWe now solve for $C$. Let $EC_{50} = 2$ mg/L and $n=1.5$.\n$$ 0.8 ((EC_{50})^n + C^n) = C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n + 0.8C^n = C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n = C^n - 0.8C^n $$\n$$ 0.8(EC_{50})^n = 0.2C^n $$\nTo solve for $C$, we first isolate the term $C^n$:\n$$ C^n = \\frac{0.8}{0.2} (EC_{50})^n = 4(EC_{50})^n $$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{C}{EC_{50}} \\right)^n = 4 $$\nNow, take the $n$-th root of both sides:\n$$ \\frac{C}{EC_{50}} = 4^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\n$$ C = EC_{50} \\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{n}} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values $EC_{50} = 2$ and $n = 1.5$:\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{1.5}} $$\nSince $1.5 = \\frac{3}{2}$, its reciprocal is $\\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot 4^{\\frac{2}{3}} $$\nThis can be calculated as:\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot (4^2)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 2 \\cdot 16^{\\frac{1}{3}} $$\n$$ C = 2 \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{16} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ C \\approx 2 \\cdot (2.519842) $$\n$$ C \\approx 5.039684 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ C \\approx 5.040 $$\nThe units for concentration are mg/L, as given for $EC_{50}$.\nThe final concentration required is $5.040$ mg/L.",

All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to formulate and solve the problem for the steady-state condition. No scientific principles are violated, the language is precise, and the setup is complete and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of the Steady-State Response\n\nThe problem is based on the principle of mass balance for the biomarker response, $R(t)$. The rate of change of the response, $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of synthesis and the rate of elimination.\n\n$$\n\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = \\text{Rate of Synthesis} - \\text{Rate of Elimination}\n$$\n\nThe synthesis process is described as a zero-order process with rate constant $k_{in}$. The drug's inhibitory effect, $I(C)$, acts multiplicatively on this synthesis term. The term $I(C)$ represents the fractional inhibition. Therefore, the fraction of the synthesis rate that remains is $(1 - I(C))$. The drug-affected synthesis rate is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Synthesis} = k_{in} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe elimination process is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{out}$. The rate is proportional to the current level of the biomarker, $R(t)$:\n\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Elimination} = k_{out} \\, R(t)\n$$\n\nCombining these terms, we construct the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs the dynamics of the biomarker response:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dR(t)}{dt} = k_{in} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right) - k_{out} \\, R(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the steady-state level of the response, denoted as $R_{ss}$. At steady state, the system is in equilibrium, meaning the biomarker level is constant over time. This condition is mathematically expressed as $\\frac{dR}{dt} = 0$.\n\nSetting the derivative to zero, we replace $R(t)$ with its steady-state value $R_{ss}$:\n\n$$\n0 = k_{in} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right) - k_{out} \\, R_{ss}\n$$\n\nWe can now solve for $R_{ss}$:\n\n$$\nk_{out} \\, R_{ss} = k_{in} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR_{ss} = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_{out}} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the definition for the inhibitory effect $I(C)$ as an inhibitory maximum effect model:\n$$\nI(C) = \\frac{I_{\\max}\\, C}{IC_{50} + C}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $I(C)$ into our equation for $R_{ss}$ yields the final symbolic form for the steady-state response under constant drug exposure:\n\n$$\nR_{ss} = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_{out}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{I_{\\max}\\, C}{IC_{50} + C} \\right)\n$$\n\nThis expression defines the steady-state response in terms of all the specified model parameters.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nThe next step is to evaluate this expression using the provided numerical values:\n-   $k_{in} = 10$ units$\\cdot$h$^{-1}$\n-   $k_{out} = 0.5$ h$^{-1}$\n-   $I_{\\max} = 0.8$\n-   $IC_{50} = 2$ mg$\\cdot$L$^{-1}$\n-   $C = 3$ mg$\\cdot$L$^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the inhibitory effect $I(C)$ for $C=3$:\n$$\nI(C=3) = \\frac{I_{\\max}\\, C}{IC_{50} + C} = \\frac{(0.8) \\, (3)}{2 + 3} = \\frac{2.4}{5} = 0.48\n$$\nThe value $0.48$ represents a $48\\%$ inhibition of the synthesis rate.\n\nNow, we substitute this value and the rate constants into the expression for $R_{ss}$:\n$$\nR_{ss} = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_{out}} \\left( 1 - I(C) \\right) = \\frac{10}{0.5} \\left( 1 - 0.48 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR_{ss} = 20 \\left( 0.52 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nR_{ss} = 10.4\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $10.4$ already has three significant figures ($1$, $0$, and $4$). Thus, no further rounding is necessary. The units of the response would be the units of $k_{in}$ divided by the units of $k_{out}$, which is (units$\\cdot$h$^{-1}$)/(h$^{-1}$) = units, as expected.",

In this TMDD model, in addition to the linear systemic clearance ($CL$), there is a clearance pathway via internalization of the drug-receptor complex ($k_{int}$). This pathway is nonlinear because it depends on the formation of the complex, which is limited by the number of available receptors.\n\nTo assess the potential for nonlinearity, we can analyze two key aspects:\n1.  **Saturability of the binding process:** We can define a quasi-steady-state dissociation constant, $K_{ss}$, which represents the drug concentration at which $50\\%$ of the receptors would be occupied at steady state. This constant is analogous to the Michaelis-Menten constant ($K_m$).\n    $$\n    K_{ss} = \\frac{k_{off} + k_{int}}{k_{on}} = \\frac{0.1 \\text{ h}^{-1} + 0.3 \\text{ h}^{-1}}{1 \\text{ L/(mg}\\cdot\\text{h)}} = 0.4 \\text{ mg/L}\n    $$\n    The initial drug concentration is $C(0^{+}) = \\frac{10}{3} \\approx 3.33$ mg/L. The ratio $\\frac{C(0^{+})}{K_{ss}} = \\frac{3.33}{0.4} \\approx 8.3$. Since the initial drug concentration is not vastly greater than $K_{ss}$ (e.g., $ 10-100$ times), the binding is in the saturable, nonlinear region of the binding isotherm $f_R = C / (C + K_{ss})$. Our calculated initial occupancy of $f_{R}(0^{+}) \\approx 0.89$ (or $89\\%$) confirms this high degree of saturation. As the drug concentration $C(t)$ falls over time, it will pass through values comparable to and less than $K_{ss}$, causing the fractional contribution of target-mediated clearance to change, which is the definition of nonlinear PK.\n\n2.  **Significance of the target \"sink\":** We compare the total amount of drug administered with the total amount of target in the body.\n    -   Total initial drug = Dose = $10$ mg.\n    -   Total target in the body = $R_{tot0} \\times V = (1 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (3 \\text{ L}) = 3$ mg.\n    The total amount of target ($3$ mg) is a substantial fraction of the administered dose ($10$ mg). This indicates that a significant portion of the dose can be sequestered by binding to the target, creating a \"drug sink\". The amount of drug initially bound in the complex is $RC(0^{+}) \\times V = f_{R}(0^{+}) \\times R_{tot0} \\times V \\approx 0.8929 \\times (1 \\text{ mg/L}) \\times (3 \\text{ L}) \\approx 2.68$ mg. This bound amount is approximately $27\\%$ of the total dose, confirming that the target significantly impacts the drug's disposition.\n\nIn conclusion, because (i) the initial drug concentration leads to a high but not complete saturation of the target, and (ii) the total amount of target is a significant fraction of the dose, the target-mediated pathway will contribute to overall clearance in a concentration-dependent manner. Therefore, nonlinear pharmacokinetics is expected.",
