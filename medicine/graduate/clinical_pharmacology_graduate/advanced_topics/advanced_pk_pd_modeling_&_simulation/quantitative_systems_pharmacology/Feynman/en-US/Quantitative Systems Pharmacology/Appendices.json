It presents a standard, foundational derivation in quantitative systems pharmacology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Coupled ODEs**\n\nThe reversible reaction is given by the stoichiometry $R + D \\rightleftharpoons RD$. The forward reaction (association) is $R+D \\rightarrow RD$ and the reverse reaction (dissociation) is $RD \\rightarrow R+D$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $v_f$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$v_f = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\nThe rate of the reverse reaction, $v_r$, is proportional to the concentration of its reactant:\n$$v_r = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nThe net rate of change for each species is the sum of the rates of the reactions that produce it minus the sum of the rates of the reactions that consume it.\n\nFor the receptor-drug complex, $RD(t)$, it is formed by the forward reaction and consumed by the reverse reaction. Thus, its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = v_f - v_r = k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t) - k_{\\text{off}} RD(t)$$\n\nFor the free receptor, $R(t)$, it is consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nSimilarly, for the free drug, $D(t)$, it is also consumed by the forward reaction and produced by the reverse reaction. Its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{dD}{dt} = v_r - v_f = k_{\\text{off}} RD(t) - k_{\\text{on}} R(t) D(t)$$\n\nThese three ODEs describe the dynamics of the system. Note that $\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = -\\frac{dR}{dt} = -\\frac{dD}{dt}$, which is consistent with the stoichiometry of the reaction and the provided conservation laws. Differentiating $R(t) + RD(t) = R_{\\text{tot}}$ with respect to time $t$ yields $\\frac{dR}{dt} + \\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$, which is satisfied by our derived ODEs.\n\n**2. Determination of the Equilibrium Solution**\n\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of change of all concentrations is zero. We denote the equilibrium concentrations of free receptor, free drug, and complex as $R$, $D$, and $RD$, respectively, dropping the explicit time dependence. The problem statement itself uses $D$ to denote the equilibrium free drug concentration.\n\nSetting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\\frac{d(RD)}{dt} = 0$$\nThis implies:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D - k_{\\text{off}} RD = 0$$\nRearranging the terms, we find the balance between association and dissociation at equilibrium:\n$$k_{\\text{on}} R D = k_{\\text{off}} RD$$\n\nThe problem defines the equilibrium dissociation constant as $K_D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}}$. We can divide the equilibrium balance equation by $k_{\\text{on}}$ to introduce $K_D$:\n$$R D = \\frac{k_{\\text{off}}}{k_{\\text{on}}} RD$$\n$$R D = K_D RD$$\n\nThe problem requests the equilibrium concentration of the complex, $RD$, in terms of the total receptor concentration $R_{\\text{tot}}$, the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$, and $K_D$. To achieve this, we use the conservation law for receptors, which also holds at equilibrium:\n$$R + RD = R_{\\text{tot}}$$\nFrom this, we express the equilibrium free receptor concentration $R$ in terms of $R_{\\text{tot}}$ and $RD$:\n$$R = R_{\\text{tot}} - RD$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $R$ into our equilibrium condition $R D = K_D RD$:\n$$(R_{\\text{tot}} - RD) D = K_D RD$$\nAn important assumption, as implied by the problem's framing, is that the equilibrium free drug concentration $D$ is treated as a known independent variable. This is a common scenario in pharmacology experiments where $D$ is either directly measured or is assumed to be approximately equal to the total drug concentration, $D_{\\text{tot}}$, under the condition $D_{\\text{tot}} \\gg R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n\nWe now solve the equation for $RD$:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D - RD \\cdot D = K_D RD$$\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD \\cdot D + K_D RD$$\nFactor out $RD$ on the right-hand side:\n$$R_{\\text{tot}} D = RD (D + K_D)$$\nFinally, isolating $RD$ gives the desired equilibrium solution:\n$$RD = \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D}$$\n\n**3. Computation of the Fractional Occupancy**\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $f$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are bound to the drug.\n$$f = \\frac{RD}{R_{\\text{tot}}}$$\nUsing the expression for the equilibrium concentration of $RD$ derived in the previous step, we substitute it into the definition of $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{tot}} D}{D + K_D} \\right)$$\nThe $R_{\\text{tot}}$ terms in the numerator and denominator cancel out, yielding the final expression for fractional occupancy:\n$$f = \\frac{D}{D + K_D}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation. It is a dimensionless quantity, as $D$ and $K_D$ both have units of concentration. The expression gives the fractional occupancy as a hyperbolic function of the free drug concentration $D$.",

            "solution": "Begin with core definitions and laws. The law of mass action prescribes the association rate between free drug and free target as $k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R$ (second order) and the dissociation rate of complex as $k_{\\text{off}}\\,DR$ (first order). Free target is synthesized at a constant rate $k_{in}$ (zero order) and degraded at a rate $k_{out}\\,R$ (first order).

Free drug is removed by non-specific processes at a rate $k_e\\,C$ (first order).\n\nApply mass balances for each species:\n\n1. Free drug $C$.

Internalization removes $DR$ and depletes total receptor, but it does not directly remove free $R$; including $-k_{int}\\,DR$ in $\\dfrac{dR}{dt}$ double counts receptor loss and incorrectly alters the balance for free $R$. Incorrect.\n\nC. The $C$ equation omits the source $+k_{\\text{off}}\\,DR$ from dissociation. Dissociation must increase free drug, so its absence violates mass conservation between $C$ and $DR$. The accompanying definition suggesting dissociation only recovers $R$ contradicts the reversible binding stoichiometry. Incorrect.\n\nD. The $DR$ equation adds $-k_e\\,DR$, implying non-specific elimination acts equally on complex. Under the stated assumptions, $k_e$ acts on free drug only, while complex is cleared via $k_{int}$. This extra term misattributes elimination pathways and breaks the intended separation between non-specific clearance and TMDD. Incorrect.\n\nE. The signs associated with $k_{\\text{on}}$ are inverted: $+k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R$ appears as a source for $C$ and $R$, and $-k_{\\text{on}}\\,C\\,R$ as a sink for $DR$. Association consumes $C$ and $R$ and produces $DR$; the option reverses these directions.

The protein is continuously synthesized at a constant rate $k_{syn}$ and degraded via a first-order process with a rate constant $k_{deg}$.

In the absence of any inhibitor, the system is at a steady state with a total target concentration of $T_0$.\n\nTwo different competitive inhibitors, Inhibitor A and Inhibitor B, are developed to block the function of this target.
