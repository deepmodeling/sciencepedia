            "problem": "Consider an endogenous biomarker response $R(t)$ governed by a standard indirect response turnover model, where the production (zero-order input) rate is $k_{in}$ and the loss (first-order output) rate constant is $k_{out}$. The fundamental base of this model is the mass balance for a well-mixed compartment: the time rate of change of $R(t)$ equals input minus output, so $dR/dt = k_{in} - k_{out} R(t)$. Assume the system is at steady state for $t<0$, with baseline $R(t)=R_{0}$ satisfying $dR/dt=0$ and no drug present. At time $t=0$, an intervention instantaneously reduces the production rate to $k_{in}(1-\\alpha)$, where $0<\\alpha<1$, without directly altering the loss process.\n\nUsing only the mass balance and steady-state definition, compute the initial slope $dR/dt|_{t=0^{+}}$ at the moment immediately after the perturbation, expressed in terms of $\\alpha$, $k_{out}$, and $R_{0}$. Then, interpret the sign of this initial slope in terms of the underlying mechanism (production inhibition versus loss stimulation) that would produce such a response. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $dR/dt|_{t=0^{+}}$ in terms of $\\alpha$, $k_{out}$, and $R_{0}$; do not include any units in the final expression and do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of pharmacodynamic modeling, specifically the indirect response model. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive a unique solution. The definitions and constraints are clear, consistent, and do not violate any physical or mathematical principles.\n\nThe starting point is the mass balance differential equation governing the response $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{in} - k_{out} R(t)\n$$\nwhere $k_{in}$ is the zero-order production rate and $k_{out}$ is the first-order loss rate constant.\n\nFor time $t<0$, the system is in a pre-intervention steady state. By definition, at steady state, the rate of change of the response is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$. The response is at its baseline level, $R(t)=R_{0}$. Substituting these conditions into the governing equation gives:\n$$\n0 = k_{in} - k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nThis allows us to express the production rate $k_{in}$ in terms of the baseline response and the loss rate constant:\n$$\nk_{in} = k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nThis relationship is fundamental, as it connects the model parameters under baseline conditions.\n\nAt time $t=0$, an intervention occurs. The problem states that the production rate is instantaneously reduced to $k_{in}(1-\\alpha)$, while the loss process, characterized by $k_{out}$, remains unaltered. Therefore, for all time $t \\ge 0$, the governing differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{in}(1-\\alpha) - k_{out} R(t)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the initial slope, which is the value of the derivative $\\frac{dR}{dt}$ at the moment immediately after the perturbation, denoted as $t=0^{+}$. To find this, we evaluate the new differential equation at $t=0^{+}$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = k_{in}(1-\\alpha) - k_{out} R(0^{+})\n$$\nThe response $R(t)$ represents a physical or biological quantity, such as the concentration of a biomarker. Such quantities cannot change instantaneously in a well-mixed compartment model. Therefore, the value of the response must be continuous across the point of perturbation at $t=0$. This means the value of $R(t)$ immediately after the perturbation is the same as its value immediately before:\n$$\nR(0^{+}) = R(0^{-}) = R_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting $R(0^{+}) = R_{0}$ into the expression for the initial slope gives:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = k_{in}(1-\\alpha) - k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in terms of $\\alpha$, $k_{out}$, and $R_{0}$. To achieve this, we must eliminate $k_{in}$ from the expression. We use the relationship derived from the steady-state condition, $k_{in} = k_{out} R_{0}$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = (k_{out} R_{0})(1-\\alpha) - k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nNow, we simplify this algebraic expression:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = k_{out} R_{0} - \\alpha k_{out} R_{0} - k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nThe term $k_{out} R_{0}$ cancels out, leaving:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dR}{dt} \\right|_{t=0^{+}} = -\\alpha k_{out} R_{0}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the initial slope.\n\nFor the interpretation, we analyze the sign of this slope. The problem states that $0 < \\alpha < 1$. The loss rate constant $k_{out}$ must be positive ($k_{out} > 0$), as it characterizes a removal process. The baseline response $R_{0}$, representing a concentration or quantity of an endogenous substance, must be positive ($R_{0} > 0$) for a turnover process to exist. Therefore, the product $\\alpha k_{out} R_{0}$ is positive. The entire expression for the slope, $-\\alpha k_{out} R_{0}$, is consequently negative.\n\nA negative initial slope, $\\frac{dR}{dt}|_{t=0^{+}} < 0$, means that the response $R(t)$ begins to decrease immediately after the drug's effect begins. This is perfectly consistent with the stipulated mechanism of production inhibition. At steady state, production ($k_{in}$) and loss ($k_{out} R_{0}$) are balanced. The intervention reduces the production rate to $k_{in}(1-\\alpha)$ while the loss rate at that instant remains $k_{out} R_{0} = k_{in}$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, the new production rate is strictly less than the loss rate. This imbalance ($rate_{in} < rate_{out}$) causes a net decrease in the amount of the response variable, hence the negative slope.",

            "problem": "An endogenous biomarker $R$ is maintained by first-order turnover: input at a constant zero-order rate $k_{\\text{in}}$ and loss at a first-order rate proportional to $R$ with rate constant $k_{\\text{out}}$. A drug with plasma concentration $C$ modulates the biological process by stimulating the loss pathway, consistent with the mechanistic notion that the drug increases the hazard of removal (as in a cell life-span hazard model where the death hazard is elevated by drug exposure). Let the drug effect be represented by a nonnegative function $I(C)$ that multiplies the loss rate, so the governing mass-balance principle is that the net rate of change equals input minus output. Two alternative effect functions are considered: a linear model $I(C) = \\theta C$ with $\\theta > 0$, and a maximum effect model $I(C) = \\dfrac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C}$ with $E_{\\max} > 0$ and $EC_{50} > 0$, where $E_{\\max}$ denotes the maximum effect and $EC_{50}$ denotes the concentration at half-maximum effect.

A defensible data-driven selection criterion is: prefer the maximum effect model if observed $R$–$C$ data at high $C$ show curvature consistent with approach to a nonzero plateau and model comparison via a formal test such as the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) or information criteria like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) significantly favors the saturable model; otherwise, if $R$ continues decreasing approximately linearly (on the appropriate scale) without evidence of plateau up to the highest $C$, a linear model may be adequate over the studied range.\n\nD.

This is a cornerstone of quantitative pharmacology and is based on fundamental mass-balance principles. The models are scientifically established and widely used.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is structured as a differential equation whose steady-state solution is to be analyzed. The phrase \"the drug increases the hazard of removal ... nonnegative function $I(C)$ that multiplies the loss rate\" implies a modification to the loss rate constant. The standard formulation for stimulation is an increase in the rate constant, leading to a new rate constant $k_{\\text{out}}' = k_{\\text{out}}(1+S(C))$, where $S(C)$ is a stimulatory function. Here, $I(C)$ is used for this function. The resulting ODE, $\\dfrac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}} - k_{\\text{out}}(1+I(C))R$, is well-defined and yields a unique, stable steady-state solution for any given $C \\ge 0$. The questions posed are precise and admit a unique T/F evaluation.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is formal and quantitative. No subjective or ambiguous terminology is used that would prevent a rigorous analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Steady-State Response**\n\nThe governing mass-balance equation is given by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\text{rate of input} - \\text{rate of output}\n$$\nThe input rate is a constant $k_{\\text{in}}$. The baseline output (loss) rate is $k_{\\text{out}}R$. The drug stimulates this loss process, meaning the effective loss rate constant is increased. The standard model for stimulation represents the new loss rate constant as $k_{\\text{out}}(1 + I(C))$. Thus, the ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}} - k_{\\text{out}}(1 + I(C))R\n$$\nAt steady state, the concentration of the biomarker does not change, so $\\dfrac{dR}{dt} = 0$. Let $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$ be the steady-state biomarker level at a constant drug concentration $C$.\n$$\n0 = k_{\\text{in}} - k_{\\text{out}}(1 + I(C))R_{\\text{ss}}(C)\n$$\nSolving for $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$ yields the general steady-state response function:\n$$\nR_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + I(C))}\n$$\nThe baseline steady-state level, $R_0$, occurs when $C=0$. For both proposed models, $I(0)=0$, so $R_0 = \\dfrac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}}$.\n\n**Asymptotic Analysis ($C \\to \\infty$)**\n\nWe now analyze the behavior of $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$ as $C$ becomes very large for the two specified functional forms of $I(C)$.\n\n1.  **Linear Model: $I(C) = \\theta C$**\n    $$\n    R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + \\theta C)}\n    $$\n    As $C \\to \\infty$, the term $\\theta C$ in the denominator grows without bound.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + \\theta C)} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{\\infty} = 0\n    $$\n    In this model, the response does not saturate at a non-zero value; instead, the biomarker can be driven to complete elimination at sufficiently high drug concentrations.\n\n2.  **Maximum Effect Model: $I(C) = \\dfrac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C}$**\n    $$\n    R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}\\left(1 + \\frac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C}\\right)}\n    $$\n    First, we determine the limit of $I(C)$ as $C \\to \\infty$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} I(C) = \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\frac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C} = \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} \\frac{E_{\\max} \\frac{C}{C}}{\\frac{EC_{50}}{C} + \\frac{C}{C}} = \\frac{E_{\\max}}{0 + 1} = E_{\\max}\n    $$\n    The drug effect saturates at a maximal value of $E_{\\max}$. Substituting this into the limit for $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + \\lim_{C \\to \\infty} I(C))} = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + E_{\\max})}\n    $$\n    In this model, the response saturates. $R_{\\text{ss}}$ approaches a non-zero plateau as $C$ increases. The biomarker cannot be reduced below this limiting value, regardless of how high the drug concentration becomes.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Under stimulation of loss, the steady-state response $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$ satisfies $R_{\\text{ss}}(C) \\to 0$ as $C \\to \\infty$ for $I(C) = \\theta C$, whereas $R_{\\text{ss}}(C) \\to \\dfrac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + E_{\\max})}$ as $C \\to \\infty$ for $I(C) = \\dfrac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C}$.**\nThis statement presents the results of the asymptotic analysis performed above. My calculation shows that for the linear model, $\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = 0$. My calculation for the maximum effect model shows $\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{in}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + E_{\\max})}$. The statement is fully consistent with these derivations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If the drug instead inhibits production via the turnover model with production multiplied by $(1 - I(C))$, a linear effect $I(C) = \\theta C$ ensures $R_{\\text{ss}}(C) \\ge 0$ for all $C$, so the linear model is always physically consistent at high concentrations.**\nThis option describes a different mechanism: inhibition of production. The ODE would be:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = k_{\\text{in}}(1 - I(C)) - k_{\\text{out}}R\n$$\nThe steady-state solution is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}(1 - I(C))}{k_{\\text{out}}}\n$$\nThe physical requirement that $R$ be nonnegative implies $R_{\\text{ss}}(C) \\ge 0$. Since $k_{\\text{in}} > 0$ and $k_{\\text{out}} > 0$, this requires $1 - I(C) \\ge 0$, or $I(C) \\le 1$.\nNow consider the linear effect model, $I(C) = \\theta C$. The condition for physical consistency becomes $\\theta C \\le 1$, which is only true for $C \\le 1/\\theta$. For any concentration $C > 1/\\theta$, the model would predict a negative $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$, which is physically impossible. The statement's claim that the linear model is \"always physically consistent at high concentrations\" is therefore false. This is a known limitation of the linear model for inhibition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. A defensible data-driven selection criterion is: prefer the maximum effect model if observed $R$–$C$ data at high $C$ show curvature consistent with approach to a nonzero plateau and model comparison via a formal test such as the Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT) or information criteria like the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) significantly favors the saturable model; otherwise, if $R$ continues decreasing approximately linearly (on the appropriate scale) without evidence of plateau up to the highest $C$, a linear model may be adequate over the studied range.**\nThis statement describes a standard, robust methodology for model selection in the empirical sciences. The key difference between the two models lies in their high-concentration behavior (saturation vs. non-saturation). It is therefore logical that high-concentration data are needed to distinguish them. Visual inspection (plotting $R$ vs. $C$) provides initial evidence: a curve flattening to a non-zero horizontal asymptote supports the maximum effect model. However, visual assessment is subjective. Rigorous, objective model comparison must be done using statistical tests. AIC and BIC are information criteria that balance goodness-of-fit with model complexity (parsimony), making them ideal for comparing non-nested or related models with different numbers of parameters. An LRT is also a standard tool, typically used for nested models. If the data does not support the additional complexity of the saturable model (e.g., the AIC/BIC for the linear model is lower, or the improvement in fit for the saturable model is not statistically significant), the principle of parsimony (Occam's razor) dictates that the simpler linear model should be preferred for the concentration range studied. This statement accurately reflects these principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. If $\\theta = \\dfrac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}}$, both the linear and maximum effect models predict identical asymptotic behavior of $R_{\\text{ss}}(C)$ as $C \\to \\infty$.**\nThe asymptotic behaviors are $\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = 0$ for the linear model and $\\lim_{C \\to \\infty} R_{\\text{ss}}(C) = \\frac{k_{\\text{in}}}{k_{\\text{out}}(1 + E_{\\max})}$ for the maximum effect model. As derived, these two limits are fundamentally different. One is zero, and the other is a positive constant (since $k_{\\text{in}}, k_{\\text{out}}, E_{\\max}$ are all positive). The condition $\\theta = \\dfrac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}}$ relates the initial slopes of the two $I(C)$ functions but does not alter their distinct long-term behaviors as $C \\to \\infty$. Therefore, the models cannot have identical asymptotic behavior.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For $C \\ll EC_{50}$, the maximum effect function satisfies $I(C) \\approx \\dfrac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}} C$, so both effect models are locally indistinguishable on the basis of small-$C$ data; diagnosing saturation requires data extending well beyond $EC_{50}$ to reveal deviations from linearity in $R(C)$.**\nLet's examine the maximum effect model, $I(C) = \\dfrac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50} + C}$, under the condition $C \\ll EC_{50}$. This means $C$ is very small compared to $EC_{50}$, so in the denominator, $EC_{50} + C \\approx EC_{50}$.\nThus, for small $C$, the function can be approximated by:\n$$\nI(C) \\approx \\frac{E_{\\max} C}{EC_{50}} = \\left(\\frac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}}\\right) C\n$$\nThis is a linear function of $C$, identical in form to the linear model $I(C) = \\theta C$ if we set $\\theta = \\dfrac{E_{\\max}}{EC_{50}}$. This is the first-order term of the Taylor expansion of $I(C)$ around $C=0$. Because the two models are indistinguishable at low concentrations, one cannot determine whether the true underlying process is saturable or not using only data from the low-concentration range. To observe the curvature and flattening characteristic of saturation, one must collect data at concentrations that are not small compared to $EC_{50}$, i.e., in the vicinity of and beyond $EC_{50}$. This is precisely what the statement claims.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

At steady state, $\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$, giving the baseline biomarker level $R_0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{in}} - k_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot R_0 \\implies R_0 = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{in}}}{k_{\\mathrm{out}}} $$\nIn the presence of a constant drug concentration $C_{ss}$ (as in the pilot study), a new steady state $R_{ss}$ is reached where $\\frac{dR}{dt}=0$:\n$$ 0 = k_{\\mathrm{in}} \\cdot (1 - I(C_{ss})) - k_{\\mathrm{out}} \\cdot R_{ss} $$\nSolving for $R_{ss}$ and substituting $k_{\\mathrm{in}} = R_0 \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$ R_{ss} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{in}}}{k_{\\mathrm{out}}} \\cdot (1 - I(C_{ss})) = R_0 \\cdot (1 - I(C_{ss})) $$\nThe problem describes $I(C)$ as a standard saturable inhibitory function.

The highest concentration used ($0.5\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot L^{-1}}$) is only $10\\%$ of the expected $IC_{50}$.\n\nUnder the condition $C \\ll IC_{50}$, the denominator of the $I(C)$ function can be approximated: $IC_{50} + C \\approx IC_{50}$. This simplifies the inhibition function to a linear relationship:\n$$ I(C) \\approx \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot C}{IC_{50}} $$\nSubstituting this linear approximation into the steady-state response equation gives:\n$$ R_{ss}(C_{ss}) \\approx R_0 \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}\\right) C_{ss} \\right) $$\nThis equation shows that for the low concentrations used in the pilot study, the steady-state biomarker response $R_{ss}$ is approximately a linear function of the steady-state drug concentration $C_{ss}$. The data from the study consist of pairs $(C_{ss}, R_{ss})$, which would lie on a straight line with intercept $R_0$ and slope $-R_0 \\cdot \\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$. From such data, one can estimate the baseline response $R_0$ and the composite parameter representing the initial slope of the inhibition curve, which is the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$. However, one cannot disentangle this ratio to uniquely determine the individual values of $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$. An infinite number of pairs $(I_{\\max}, IC_{50})$ can produce the same ratio. For example, $(I_{\\max}=0.8, IC_{50}=8)$ and $(I_{\\max}=0.4, IC_{50}=4)$ yield the same ratio of $0.1$.\n\nTherefore, based on the steady-state data from the pilot study alone, the parameters $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$ are not separately identifiable. They are structurally confounded in the low-concentration regime. To decorrelate them, a follow-up study must generate data that reveals the nonlinearity of the $I(C)$ function. This requires drug concentrations that are not negligible compared to $IC_{50}$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Proposed Follow-up Study Designs**\n\nThe objective is to select study designs that will generate data allowing for the separate estimation of $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$. This requires observing the system's response at concentrations high enough to reveal the curvature and/or plateau of the dose-response relationship.\n\n**A. Two-period cross-over per subject: in one period, an intravenous regimen targets a near-constant average concentration $C \\approx 0.1\\times IC_{50}$; in the other, $C \\approx 10\\times IC_{50}$. In both periods, collect dense concentration and biomarker measurements over multiple $k_{\\mathrm{out}}^{-1}$ to characterize approach to steady state and washout.**\nThis design is robust. The low-dose arm ($C \\approx 0.1 \\times IC_{50}$) anchors the initial linear slope of the dose-response curve, which is sensitive to the ratio $I_{\\max}/IC_{50}$. The high-dose arm ($C \\approx 10 \\times IC_{50}$) pushes the system close to its maximum response. At $C = 10 \\times IC_{50}$, $I(C) = \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot 10 \\cdot IC_{50}}{IC_{50} + 10 \\cdot IC_{50}} = \\frac{10}{11} I_{\\max} \\approx 0.91 \\cdot I_{\\max}$. This provides a strong signal to estimate $I_{\\max}$. With data from both the linear and the plateau regions, the parameters $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$ can be decorrelated and estimated separately. The collection of dense dynamic data further enhances the identifiability of all model parameters, including $k_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Increase the pilot sample size at the same low doses to reduce standard errors, keeping $C \\in [0.05,\\,0.5]\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot L^{-1}}$ and the same sparse steady-state sampling.**\nThis strategy addresses precision, not identifiability. Increasing the number of subjects will lead to a more precise estimate of the composite parameter (the slope, $\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$). However, since the experiment remains in the low-concentration linear regime, it provides no new information to break the confounding between $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$. The problem is one of structural ambiguity in the experimental design, not random error, and cannot be solved by simply collecting more of the same uninformative data.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Add one high-dose arm that achieves $C \\gg IC_{50}$ at steady state, and collect steady-state biomarker and concentration samples sufficient to quantify the plateau reduction relative to baseline.**\nThis is a direct and effective strategy. When $C \\gg IC_{50}$, the inhibition function $I(C)$ approaches its asymptote: $I(C) = \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot C}{IC_{50} + C} \\approx \\frac{I_{\\max} \\cdot C}{C} = I_{\\max}$. The steady-state biomarker level at this dose would be $R_{ss} \\approx R_0 (1-I_{\\max})$. By measuring $R_0$ (at baseline) and $R_{ss}$ at this high concentration, $I_{\\max}$ can be directly calculated. Once $I_{\\max}$ is known, the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$ determined from the pilot study data can be used to solve for $IC_{50}$. This design effectively decorrelates the parameters.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Implement within-subject dose titration across $C \\in [0.05,\\,0.5]\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot L^{-1}}$ with very frequent biomarker sampling, but do not exceed this concentration range.**\nSimilar to option B, this design is confined to the low-concentration range where the dose-response is linear. While dose titration and frequent sampling are efficient ways to map out a dose-response relationship, if the entire experiment is conducted within the linear range, it will only serve to very precisely define the straight line whose slope depends on the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$. It does not provide the information on the curve's nonlinearity needed to separate the parameters.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Administer, in a subset of subjects, a single intravenous bolus designed so that $C(t)$ starts above $IC_{50}$ and decays through $IC_{50}$ into $C \\ll IC_{50}$, with joint concentration–biomarker sampling over a window of several $k_{\\mathrm{out}}^{-1}$ to track the dynamic response across the full concentration range within the same individual.**\nThis is a highly informative design. A single IV bolus generates a continuously changing concentration profile $C(t)$ that can sweep through the entire relevant range: from high concentrations ($C > IC_{50}$), which inform $I_{\\max}$, through intermediate concentrations ($C \\approx IC_{50}$), which inform the curvature and $IC_{50}$ itself, down to low concentrations ($C \\ll IC_{50}$), which inform the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\max}}{IC_{50}}$. Jointly modeling the time course of concentration, $C(t)$, and the dynamic biomarker response, $R(t)$, provides rich information to estimate all parameters, including $I_{\\max}$ and $IC_{50}$, and break their correlation efficiently within a single experimental session per subject.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
