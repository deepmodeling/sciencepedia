            "problem": "A targeted oncology therapy requires a companion diagnostic to establish clinical validity for enriching patients likely to respond. A continuous biomarker score $S$ is produced by the companion diagnostic for each patient prior to treatment initiation. In a pivotal trial used to assess clinical validity, the binary clinical outcome $Y$ is defined as responder ($Y=1$) versus non-responder ($Y=0$). Under a large-sample regime and stable assay performance, it is reasonable to model the conditional distributions\n$$\nS \\mid Y=1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1}^{2}), \\quad S \\mid Y=0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2}),\n$$\nwith independent draws across patients and independence between draws from the two groups. The test positivity rule is that a patient is classified as positive for treatment if $S \\geq c$ for a threshold $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, derive an analytical expression for the area under the ROC curve (AUC) implied by the model above, expressed in terms of $\\mu_{1}, \\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{1}, \\sigma_{0}$. Then, using the parameter values $\\mu_{1}=2.0$, $\\sigma_{1}=0.6$, $\\mu_{0}=1.0$, and $\\sigma_{0}=0.5$, compute the numerical value of the AUC. Express the final AUC as a unitless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an analytical expression for the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for a specific probabilistic model and the subsequent computation of its numerical value.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental definitions based on the problem statement. A continuous biomarker score $S$ is modeled with conditional normal distributions based on the binary clinical outcome $Y$, where $Y=1$ indicates a responder and $Y=0$ indicates a non-responder.\n$$\nS \\mid Y=1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1}^{2})\n$$\n$$\nS \\mid Y=0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})\n$$\nA test is considered positive if a patient's score $S$ is at or above a given threshold $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $S \\ge c$.\n\nThe performance of this diagnostic test at a threshold $c$ is quantified by its sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity, also known as the True Positive Rate (TPR), is the probability that a responder is correctly classified as positive.\n$$\n\\text{TPR}(c) = P(S \\ge c \\mid Y=1)\n$$\nSpecificity is the probability that a non-responder is correctly classified as negative.\n$$\n\\text{Specificity}(c) = P(S < c \\mid Y=0)\n$$\nThe False Positive Rate (FPR) is defined as $1 - \\text{Specificity}$, which is the probability that a non-responder is incorrectly classified as positive.\n$$\n\\text{FPR}(c) = 1 - P(S < c \\mid Y=0) = P(S \\ge c \\mid Y=0)\n$$\nThe ROC curve is the parametric plot of $\\text{TPR}(c)$ versus $\\text{FPR}(c)$ as the threshold $c$ is varied over all possible real values. The AUC is the area under this curve.\n\nA fundamental and elegant result from statistical theory states that the AUC is equivalent to the probability that a randomly chosen individual from the positive group (responders, $Y=1$) will have a higher score than a randomly chosen individual from the negative group (non-responders, $Y=0$). Let $S_1$ denote the score for a random responder and $S_0$ denote the score for a random non-responder. Then, based on the problem's setup, $S_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1}, \\sigma_{1}^{2})$ and $S_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{0}^{2})$, and they are independent. The AUC can thus be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = P(S_1 > S_0)\n$$\nThis identity can be rigorously shown by integrating the ROC curve. The AUC is $\\int_0^1 \\text{TPR} \\,d(\\text{FPR})$. Making a change of variables to the threshold $c$, and noting that as $c$ varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, the FPR varies from $1$ to $0$:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = \\int_{\\text{FPR}=1}^{\\text{FPR}=0} \\text{TPR}(c) \\, d(\\text{FPR}(c)) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\text{TPR}(c) \\left(-\\frac{d(\\text{FPR}(c))}{dc}\\right) dc\n$$\nWith $\\text{FPR}(c) = \\int_c^\\infty f_0(s)ds$, where $f_0$ is the PDF of $S \\mid Y=0$, we have $-\\frac{d(\\text{FPR}(c))}{dc} = f_0(c)$. So,\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(S_1 \\ge c) f_0(c) dc = P(S_1 > S_0)\n$$\nTo calculate this probability, we define a new random variable $D = S_1 - S_0$. Since $S_1$ and $S_0$ are independent normal random variables, their difference $D$ is also normally distributed.\nThe mean of $D$ is the difference of the means:\n$$\nE[D] = E[S_1] - E[S_0] = \\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}\n$$\nThe variance of $D$, due to the independence of $S_1$ and $S_0$, is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(D) = \\text{Var}(S_1 - S_0) = \\text{Var}(S_1) + (-1)^{2}\\text{Var}(S_0) = \\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}\n$$\nThus, the distribution of the difference is $D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}, \\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2})$.\n\nThe AUC is the probability $P(D > 0)$. To find this probability, we standardize the random variable $D$ to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{D - E[D]}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(D)}} = \\frac{D - (\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}}\n$$\nThe inequality $D > 0$ can be rewritten in terms of $Z$:\n$$\nZ > \\frac{0 - (\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0})}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}} \\implies Z > -\\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}}\n$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ denote the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z)$. Using the property $P(Z > a) = 1 - \\Phi(a)$ and the symmetry property $\\Phi(-a) = 1 - \\Phi(a)$, it follows that $P(Z > -a) = \\Phi(a)$.\nTherefore, the AUC is:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = P\\left(Z > -\\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the AUC in terms of the model parameters.\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\mu_{1}=2.0$, $\\sigma_{1}=0.6$, $\\mu_{0}=1.0$, and $\\sigma_{0}=0.5$.\nThe argument of the CDF $\\Phi$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1} - \\mu_{0}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{1}^{2} + \\sigma_{0}^{2}}} = \\frac{2.0 - 1.0}{\\sqrt{(0.6)^{2} + (0.5)^{2}}} = \\frac{1.0}{\\sqrt{0.36 + 0.25}} = \\frac{1.0}{\\sqrt{0.61}}\n$$\nWe compute the numerical value of this argument:\n$$\n\\frac{1.0}{\\sqrt{0.61}} \\approx \\frac{1.0}{0.78102497} \\approx 1.28037\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate the standard normal CDF at this value:\n$$\n\\text{AUC} = \\Phi(1.28037) \\approx 0.899797\n$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as requested, gives $0.8998$.",

Using the derived formula:\n$$E[Q_o] = B \\cdot S_o \\cdot p + H \\cdot (1 - C_o) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n$$E[Q_n] = B \\cdot S_n \\cdot p + H \\cdot (1 - C_n) \\cdot (1 - p)$$\n\nThe change in expected QALY per patient, $\\Delta E[Q]$, is $E[Q_n] - E[Q_o]$:\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = (B \\cdot S_n \\cdot p + H \\cdot (1 - C_n) \\cdot (1 - p)) - (B \\cdot S_o \\cdot p + H \\cdot (1 - C_o) \\cdot (1 - p))$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = B \\cdot p \\cdot (S_n - S_o) + H \\cdot (1 - p) \\cdot [(1 - C_n) - (1 - C_o)]$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = B \\cdot p \\cdot (S_n - S_o) + H \\cdot (1 - p) \\cdot (C_o - C_n)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$p = 0.15$\n$B = 0.60$\n$H = -0.05$\n$S_o = 0.95$\n$C_o = 0.97$\n$S_n = 0.93$\n$C_n = 0.985$\n\nFirst, calculate the differences in performance:\n$S_n - S_o = 0.93 - 0.95 = -0.02$\n$C_o - C_n = 0.97 - 0.985 = -0.015$\n\nSubstitute these into the expression for $\\Delta E[Q]$:\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = (0.60)(0.15)(-0.02) + (-0.05)(1 - 0.15)(-0.015)$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = (0.09)(-0.02) + (-0.05)(0.85)(-0.015)$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = -0.0018 + (-0.0425)(-0.015)$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = -0.0018 + 0.0006375$$\n$$\\Delta E[Q] = -0.0011625 \\text{ QALY per patient}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected change in total QALYs per $1000$ tested patients. Let this be $\\Delta Q_{1000}$.\n$$\\Delta Q_{1000} = 1000 \\times \\Delta E[Q]$$\n$$\\Delta Q_{1000} = 1000 \\times (-0.0011625)$$\n$$\\Delta Q_{1000} = -1.1625$$\n\nThe final step is to round the result to four significant figures.\n$$-1.1625 \\approx -1.163$$\nThe expected change is a loss of approximately $1.163$ QALYs per $1000$ patients tested.",
