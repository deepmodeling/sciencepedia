Problem Validation**\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Number of experimental treatments: $m=5$.\n- Control scheme: common control.\n- Design goal: Preserve the same marginal power for each of the $m$ experimental-versus-control hypothesis tests as would be achieved in $m$ separate, independently controlled trials.\n- Assumption (i): Treatment effect and outcome variance are identical across all arms.\n- Assumption (ii): Drop-out is negligible.\n- Assumption (iii): Hypothesis testing uses large-sample normal approximations.\n- Assumption (iv): The allocation ratio for each experimental-versus-control comparison is fixed at $1:1$.\n- Independent controls scenario: $m$ separate two-arm trials, each with a $1:1$ allocation ratio.\n- Shared control scenario: $m$ experimental arms and one common control arm. Equal per-arm allocation for experimental arms, and each experimental arm-to-control comparison maintains the $1:1$ allocation ratio.\n- Inflation factor definition: $F=\\frac{N_{\\text{shared}}}{N_{\\text{independent}}}$.\n- $N_{\\text{independent}}$: total sample size across all $m$ independent trials.\n- $N_{\\text{shared}}$: total sample size in the shared-control platform trial.\n- Task: Derive $F$ and calculate its value for $m=5$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard exercise in the statistical design of clinical trials, specifically comparing platform trial efficiency to parallel independent trials. The assumptions, such as large-sample normal theory and fixed allocation ratios, are common in introductory sample size calculations. This is a well-established topic in biostatistics and clinical pharmacology. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides a set of consistent assumptions and constraints and asks for the derivation and calculation of a specific ratio, $F$. The constraints are sufficient to determine a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language without subjective or opinion-based elements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided information (number of arms, allocation rules, power-equivalence constraint) is sufficient to derive the sample size ratio. The constraints are consistent with each other.\n- **Realism**: The scenario is a simplified but realistic representation of a common problem in clinical trial design. Platform trials are used precisely for the efficiency gains explored in this problem.\n- **Structure**: The problem is well-structured and free from ambiguity. The term \"maintains the $1:1$ allocation ratio at the per-arm level\" is a prescriptive constraint that dictates the structure of the shared-control arm's sample size relative to the experimental arms.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. The derivation can proceed.\n\n**2. Solution Derivation**\n\nLet us begin from first principles. According to assumption (iii), we are in the large-sample normal approximation setting. The sample size required to achieve a power of $1-\\beta$ for a two-sided type I error rate of $\\alpha$ in a two-sample z-test comparing two means with a common variance $\\sigma^2$ and effect size $\\delta$ is determined by the standard formula.\n\nFor a two-arm trial with sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$, the variance of the estimated difference in means is $\\sigma^2 (\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2})$. The power is a function of this variance. To maintain constant power, the quantity $\\frac{1}{n_1} + \\frac{1}{n_2}$ must be held constant.\n\nLet $n_0$ represent the sample size required for each arm in a standard, independent, two-arm clinical trial with a $1:1$ allocation ratio to achieve the desired power. In such a trial, we have one experimental arm and one control arm, with $n_0$ subjects each. The total sample size for one such trial is $2n_0$. The power-determining quantity for this benchmark comparison is $\\frac{1}{n_0} + \\frac{1}{n_0} = \\frac{2}{n_0}$.\n\n**Scenario 1: Independent Controls**\nIn this scenario, we conduct $m$ separate two-arm trials. Each trial compares one of the $m$ experimental treatments to its own dedicated control group.\n- Each of the $m$ trials has a $1:1$ allocation, so each comprises one experimental arm with $n_0$ subjects and one control arm with $n_0$ subjects.\n- The total sample size for a single trial is $n_0 + n_0 = 2n_0$.\n- Since there are $m$ such independent trials, the total sample size across all trials is:\n$$N_{\\text{independent}} = m \\times (2n_0) = 2mn_0$$\n\n**Scenario 2: Shared Control**\nIn this scenario, we have a single platform trial with $m$ experimental arms and one shared control arm. Let $n_{E,i}$ be the sample size for the $i$-th experimental arm and $n_C$ be the sample size for the shared control arm.\nThe problem states \"equal per-arm allocation\" for the experimental arms, which implies $n_{E,1} = n_{E,2} = \\dots = n_{E,m}$. Let us denote this common sample size as $n_E$.\n\nThe problem requires that the shared-control design \"preserve the same marginal power\" for each of the $m$ pairwise comparisons between an experimental arm and the shared control. This means that for each comparison (e.g., arm $E_i$ vs. arm $C$), the power must be the same as in the benchmark independent trial. This imposes a condition on their sample sizes, $n_E$ and $n_C$:\n$$\\frac{1}{n_E} + \\frac{1}{n_C} = \\frac{2}{n_0}$$\n\nFurthermore, the problem specifies a crucial constraint: \"each experimental arm-to-control comparison maintains the $1:1$ allocation ratio at the per-arm level.\" This is a prescriptive statement about the sample sizes themselves, meaning the number of subjects in an experimental arm must be equal to the number of subjects in the control arm it is being compared to. This translates to the constraint:\n$$n_E = n_C$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations to solve for $n_E$ and $n_C$ in terms of $n_0$:\n1. $\\frac{1}{n_E} + \\frac{1}{n_C} = \\frac{2}{n_0}$\n2. $n_E = n_C$\n\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{n_E} + \\frac{1}{n_E} = \\frac{2}{n_E} = \\frac{2}{n_0}$$\nThis immediately implies $n_E = n_0$.\nFrom $n_E = n_C$, we also have $n_C = n_0$.\n\nSo, in the shared-control design, each of the $m$ experimental arms must have $n_0$ subjects, and the single shared control arm must also have $n_0$ subjects.\n\nThe total sample size for the shared-control platform trial, $N_{\\text{shared}}$, is the sum of the sample sizes of all arms:\n$$N_{\\text{shared}} = (\\sum_{i=1}^{m} n_{E,i}) + n_C = (m \\times n_E) + n_C = mn_0 + n_0 = (m+1)n_0$$\n\n**Derivation of the Inflation Factor F**\nThe inflation factor $F$ is defined as the ratio of the total sample size in the shared design to the total sample size in the independent-controls design.\n$$F = \\frac{N_{\\text{shared}}}{N_{\\text{independent}}} = \\frac{(m+1)n_0}{2mn_0}$$\nThe term $n_0$, which encapsulates the specifics of the power, effect size, and variance, cancels out, leaving a general formula dependent only on the number of experimental arms, $m$:\n$$F = \\frac{m+1}{2m}$$\n\n**Calculation for m=5**\nThe problem asks for the value of $F$ for a trial with $m=5$ experimental treatments. Substituting $m=5$ into the derived formula:\n$$F = \\frac{5+1}{2 \\times 5} = \\frac{6}{10} = 0.6$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$F = 0.6000$$\nThis result indicates that the shared-control platform design, under the given constraints, requires only $60\\%$ of the total subjects that would be needed to run five separate, independent trials, representing a $40\\%$ savings in total sample size.",

This exercise  presents a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate how such drift can systematically distort results for arms that enroll at different times, underscoring the critical need for robust statistical models that account for time trends.",

            "problem": "A multi-arm, multi-stage platform trial in clinical pharmacology enrolls patients continuously over a total duration of $T=18$ months. Due to improvements in background care, the control arm response probability is known to increase approximately linearly over calendar time from $p_{C}(0)=0.25$ at trial start to $p_{C}(18)=0.35$ at month $18$. Two investigational arms are introduced at different times: an “early” arm enrolls uniformly over months $[0,6]$, and a “late” arm enrolls uniformly over months $[12,18]$. Assume uniform accrual rates over time for all arms and the control arm. Investigational arm treatment effects are constant over time on the risk-difference scale, that is, if $p_{T}(t)$ and $p_{C}(t)$ denote the treatment and control response probabilities at calendar time $t$, then $p_{T}(t)=p_{C}(t)+\\delta$ for all $t$, where $\\delta$ is the true constant risk difference.\n\nSuppose an unadjusted pooled control is used for each investigational arm’s analysis, defined as the mean response probability over all control patients accrued during $[0,18]$ months, ignoring enrollment time. The unadjusted estimator of the risk difference for an arm is the observed mean response in that arm minus this pooled control mean. Define the bias for each arm as the expected value of this unadjusted estimator minus the true $\\delta$.\n\nUsing first principles (definitions of risk difference, linear temporal drift, and time-averaging under uniform accrual), derive and compute the biases for the early and late arms under these assumptions. Express each bias as an exact fraction (as a decimal proportion, not with a percentage sign). Report your final answer as two values in the order (early, late). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "We begin from the definition of risk difference (RD): for any calendar time $t$, the treatment effect on the risk-difference scale is $p_{T}(t)-p_{C}(t)$.
