Derive and compute total clearance ($CL$) in L/h, rounded to three significant figures, from the estimated slope $\\beta_1$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is grounded in the established principles of clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, specifically Phase 0 studies, dose proportionality, area under the curve ($AUC$), clearance ($CL$), and bioavailability ($F$). The use of linear regression to model this relationship is a standard and valid approach.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides three data points, which is sufficient to determine the two parameters of a linear regression model ($\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$). The tasks are clear, sequential, and lead to a unique numerical answer.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem provides all necessary data and assumptions.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Task 1: OLS Estimation of $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$\nLet the dose be the independent variable $x$ and the $AUC$ be the dependent variable $y$. The given data points are $(x_1, y_1) = (50, 0.8)$, $(x_2, y_2) = (100, 1.6)$, and $(x_3, y_3) = (150, 2.4)$, where the units for $x$ are µg and for $y$ are ng·h/mL. The number of data points is $n=3$.\n\nThe objective of ordinary least squares (OLS) is to find the parameters $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ that minimize the sum of the squared residuals, $S$:\n$$S(\\beta_0, \\beta_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i))^2$$\n\nTo minimize $S$, we take the partial derivatives with respect to $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ and set them to zero.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\beta_0} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x_i) = 0 \\implies n\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\beta_1} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} -2x_i(y_i - \\beta_0 - \\beta_1 x_i) = 0 \\implies \\beta_0 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i + \\beta_1 \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i $$\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary sums from the data:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 50 + 100 + 150 = 300 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} y_i = 0.8 + 1.6 + 2.4 = 4.8 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i^2 = 50^2 + 100^2 + 150^2 = 2500 + 10000 + 22500 = 35000 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i y_i = (50)(0.8) + (100)(1.6) + (150)(2.4) = 40 + 160 + 360 = 560 $$\n\nThe sample means are:\n$$ \\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = \\frac{300}{3} = 100 $$\n$$ \\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i = \\frac{4.8}{3} = 1.6 $$\n\nThe standard OLS formulas for $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_0$ are:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y})}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i - n\\bar{x}\\bar{y}}{\\sum x_i^2 - n\\bar{x}^2} $$\n$$ \\beta_0 = \\bar{y} - \\beta_1 \\bar{x} $$\n\nSubstituting the computed values to find $\\beta_1$:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{560 - (3)(100)(1.6)}{35000 - (3)(100)^2} = \\frac{560 - 480}{35000 - 30000} = \\frac{80}{5000} = 0.016 $$\nThe units of $\\beta_1$ are the units of $y$ divided by the units of $x$, which is $\\frac{\\text{ng·h/mL}}{\\text{µg}}$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\beta_0$:\n$$ \\beta_0 = 1.6 - (0.016)(100) = 1.6 - 1.6 = 0 $$\nThe units of $\\beta_0$ are the same as $y$, which is ng·h/mL.\n\nThe OLS estimates are $\\beta_0 = 0$ ng·h/mL and $\\beta_1 = 0.016$ (ng·h/mL)/µg.\n\n### Task 2: Justification of Dose Proportionality\nDose proportionality dictates that the exposure to a drug, as measured by $AUC$, is directly proportional to the dose administered. Mathematically, this is expressed as $AUC = k \\times \\text{Dose}$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality. This relationship is a straight line passing through the origin $(0, 0)$.\n\nThe linear regression model is $AUC = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Dose}$. For this model to be consistent with dose proportionality, the intercept $\\beta_0$ must be zero. Our OLS estimation yielded $\\beta_0 = 0$. This indicates that, according to the data, a dose of $0$ µg would result in an $AUC$ of $0$ ng·h/mL, which is physically and biologically correct. The fact that the best-fit line passes directly through the origin, combined with the linear fit, confirms that the provided data are perfectly consistent with the principle of dose proportionality over the tested range.\n\n### Task 3: Derivation and Computation of Total Clearance ($CL$)\nThe problem provides the fundamental pharmacokinetic relationship between $AUC$, Dose, bioavailability ($F$), and total clearance ($CL$):\n$$ AUC = \\frac{F \\cdot \\text{Dose}}{CL} $$\nThis can be rearranged to express $AUC$ as a linear function of Dose:\n$$ AUC = \\left(\\frac{F}{CL}\\right) \\times \\text{Dose} $$\n\nFrom our statistical analysis in Task 1, we found the relationship to be:\n$$ AUC = \\beta_1 \\times \\text{Dose} \\quad (\\text{since } \\beta_0 = 0) $$\n\nBy comparing the pharmacokinetic model with the statistical model, we can equate the slopes:\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\frac{F}{CL} $$\n\nWe can now solve for $CL$:\n$$ CL = \\frac{F}{\\beta_1} $$\n\nWe are given $F=1$ (dimensionless) and we calculated $\\beta_1 = 0.016 \\frac{\\text{ng·h/mL}}{\\text{µg}}$.\n$$ CL = \\frac{1}{0.016 \\frac{\\text{ng·h/mL}}{\\text{µg}}} = 62.5 \\frac{\\text{µg} \\cdot \\text{mL}}{\\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{h}} $$\n\nThe final step is to convert the units of $CL$ to L/h. We must perform a unit analysis:\nThe current units are $\\frac{\\text{µg} \\cdot \\text{mL}}{\\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{h}}$.\nWe use the conversion factors:\n- $1$ µg = $1000$ ng\n- $1$ L = $1000$ mL, or $1$ mL = $10^{-3}$ L\n\nLet's substitute these into the unit expression:\n$$ 1 \\frac{\\text{µg} \\cdot \\text{mL}}{\\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{h}} = 1 \\frac{(1000 \\text{ ng}) \\cdot (10^{-3} \\text{ L})}{\\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{h}} = 1 \\frac{1000 \\cdot 10^{-3} \\text{ ng} \\cdot \\text{L}}{\\text{ng} \\cdot \\text{h}} = 1 \\frac{\\text{L}}{\\text{h}} $$\nThe conversion factor is $1$. Therefore, the numerical value does not change.\n\n$$ CL = 62.5 \\text{ L/h} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $62.5$ already has three significant figures.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of pharmacokinetics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is presented objectively.\n\nThe objective is to determine the absolute oral bioavailability, $F$, of a drug. Absolute bioavailability is defined as the fraction of an extravascularly administered dose that reaches the systemic circulation in an unchanged form. The analysis relies on the fundamental principles of noncompartmental pharmacokinetics under the assumption of a linear, time-invariant system.\n\nSystemic clearance, $CL$, represents the volume of plasma cleared of drug per unit time. For a linear pharmacokinetic system, $CL$ is constant and independent of the dose and route of administration. It is fundamentally defined by the relationship between the dose that reaches the systemic circulation and the total systemic exposure, measured as the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity ($AUC$). The relationship is:\n$$CL = \\frac{\\text{Systemically Available Dose}}{AUC}$$\n\nFor an intravenous (IV) administration, the entire administered dose, $Dose_{iv}$, enters the systemic circulation directly. Therefore, the systemically available dose is equal to $Dose_{iv}$. The clearance can be calculated from the intravenous data as:\n$$CL = \\frac{Dose_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}}$$\n\nFor an oral (per os, PO) administration, only the fraction $F$ of the administered dose, $Dose_{po}$, is absorbed and survives first-pass metabolism to reach the systemic circulation. Therefore, the systemically available dose is $F \\cdot Dose_{po}$. The clearance can be expressed in terms of the oral data as:\n$$CL = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nThe problem states that clearance is dose-independent and identical between routes. This key assumption allows us to equate the two expressions for $CL$:\n$$\\frac{Dose_{iv}}{AUC_{iv}} = \\frac{F \\cdot Dose_{po}}{AUC_{po}}$$\n\nTo find the expression for absolute bioavailability, $F$, we rearrange the equation to solve for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{AUC_{po}}{AUC_{iv}} \\cdot \\frac{Dose_{iv}}{Dose_{po}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for $F$ in terms of thearea under the curve and dose for the oral and intravenous routes.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into this expression to compute the numerical value of $F$.\nThe provided data are:\n- Oral administration: $AUC_{po} = 120 \\, \\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{h/mL}$ after a dose of $Dose_{po} = 100 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n- Intravenous microdose: $AUC_{iv} = 300 \\, \\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{h/mL}$ after a dose of $Dose_{iv} = 0.1 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n\nBefore calculating, it is critical to ensure unit consistency. The `dose ratio` $\\frac{Dose_{iv}}{Dose_{po}}$ uses units of $\\text{mg}$, which will cancel. The `AUC ratio` $\\frac{AUC_{po}}{AUC_{iv}}$ uses units of $\\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{h/mL}$, which will also cancel. Thus, $F$ will be a dimensionless quantity, as expected for a fraction.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$F = \\frac{120 \\, \\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{h/mL}}{300 \\, \\text{ng}\\cdot\\text{h/mL}} \\cdot \\frac{0.1 \\, \\text{mg}}{100 \\, \\text{mg}}$$\n$$F = \\frac{120}{300} \\cdot \\frac{0.1}{100}$$\n$$F = (0.4) \\cdot (0.001)$$\n$$F = 0.0004$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

This is an exceedingly low value. It indicates that only a very small fraction of the drug administered orally reaches the systemic circulation. Such poor bioavailability is often a result of either very low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract (poor permeability) or extensive pre-systemic elimination, also known as first-pass metabolism, in the gut wall or liver. From the perspective of a Phase $0$ microdosing study, this result is a \"no-go\" signal for the development of this compound as an oral drug. The purpose of such an early study is to quickly identify compounds with unacceptable pharmacokinetic properties, thereby preventing the expenditure of significant resources on non-viable candidates.
