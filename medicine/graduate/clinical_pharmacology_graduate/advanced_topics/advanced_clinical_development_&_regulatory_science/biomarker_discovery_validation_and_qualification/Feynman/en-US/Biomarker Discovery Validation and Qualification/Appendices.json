It presents a standard problem in analytical chemistry and clinical pharmacology concerning the validation of a quantitative assay. All necessary data, definitions, and constraints are provided to derive and compute the requested quantities.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, estimation of the model parameters from the provided data; second, derivation of the expression for the Limit of Detection (LOD) and its numerical calculation; and third, derivation of the expression for the Limit of Quantitation (LOQ) and its numerical calculation.\n\n### 1. Estimation of Model Parameters\n\nThe analysis is based on the linear calibration model $S = a + bc + \\varepsilon$, where $S$ is the measured signal for a true concentration $c$, $a$ is the mean blank signal, $b$ is the sensitivity (slope), and $\\varepsilon$ is a homoscedastic Gaussian noise term with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, i.e., $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})$.\n\n**Estimation of $a$ (mean blank signal):**\nThe parameter $a$ is estimated as the sample mean of the blank replicate signals. Let $S_{B,i}$ be the signal of the $i$-th blank replicate, with $n_B=10$.\nThe data are: $\\{0.06, 0.12, 0.11, 0.19, 0.13, 0.08, 0.18, 0.15, 0.10, 0.14\\}$.\nThe estimate $\\hat{a}$ is calculated as:\n$$\n\\hat{a} = \\bar{S}_B = \\frac{1}{n_B}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_B} S_{B,i} = \\frac{1.26}{10} = 0.126\n$$\n\n**Estimation of $\\sigma$ (noise standard deviation):**\nThe parameter $\\sigma$ is estimated from the standard deviation of the blank replicates, as this represents the noise floor of the assay, which is critical for determining detection and quantitation limits.\nThe sample variance of the blank signals is:\n$$\ns_B^2 = \\frac{1}{n_B-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_B} (S_{B,i} - \\bar{S}_B)^2 = \\frac{0.01524}{10-1} \\approx 0.0016933\n$$\nThe estimate $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is the sample standard deviation:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma} = s_B = \\sqrt{0.0016933} \\approx 0.0411501\n$$\n\n**Estimation of $b$ (slope/sensitivity):**\nThe parameter $b$ is estimated using the difference in mean signals between the spiked and blank replicates, divided by the known concentration of the spike, $c_L=1.00$ ng/mL.\nThe spiked replicate signals ($n_S=10$) are: $\\{0.88, 0.95, 0.90, 0.98, 0.93, 0.92, 0.96, 0.91, 0.89, 0.94\\}$.\nThe sample mean of the spiked signals, $\\bar{S}_S$, is:\n$$\n\\bar{S}_S = \\frac{1}{n_S}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_S} S_{S,i} = \\frac{9.26}{10} = 0.926\n$$\nThe estimate $\\hat{b}$ is then:\n$$\n\\hat{b} = \\frac{\\bar{S}_S - \\bar{S}_B}{c_L} = \\frac{0.926 - 0.126}{1.00} = 0.800\n$$\n\n### 2. Derivation and Calculation of LOD\n\nThe LOD is defined based on a hypothesis testing framework.\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, states that the sample is a blank ($c=0$), so its signal $S$ is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(a, \\sigma^2)$.\nThe alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, states that the sample contains analyte at concentration $c>0$, so its signal $S$ is drawn from $\\mathcal{N}(a+bc, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nA decision is made based on a critical signal level, $S_{crit}$. If a measurement is greater than $S_{crit}$, $H_0$ is rejected.\n\nThe Type I error rate, $\\alpha=0.05$, is the probability of a false positive (rejecting $H_0$ when it is true):\n$$\n\\alpha = P(S > S_{crit} | c=0) = P\\left(\\frac{S-a}{\\sigma} > \\frac{S_{crit}-a}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nFor a standard normal variable $Z$, this implies $\\frac{S_{crit}-a}{\\sigma} = z_{1-\\alpha}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha}$ is the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution. This gives the expression for the critical signal:\n$$\nS_{crit} = a + z_{1-\\alpha}\\sigma\n$$\nThe Type II error rate, $\\beta=0.05$, is the probability of a false negative (failing to reject $H_0$ when it is false). The LOD is the specific concentration $c=\\text{LOD}$ at which this error rate occurs:\n$$\n\\beta = P(S \\le S_{crit} | c=\\text{LOD}) = P\\left(\\frac{S - (a+b\\cdot\\text{LOD})}{\\sigma} \\le \\frac{S_{crit} - (a+b\\cdot\\text{LOD})}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nThis implies $\\frac{S_{crit} - a - b\\cdot\\text{LOD}}{\\sigma} = z_{\\beta} = -z_{1-\\beta}$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $S_{crit}-a$:\n$$\nz_{1-\\alpha}\\sigma - b\\cdot\\text{LOD} = -z_{1-\\beta}\\sigma\n$$\nSolving for LOD:\n$$\nb\\cdot\\text{LOD} = (z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})\\sigma \\implies \\text{LOD} = \\frac{(z_{1-\\alpha} + z_{1-\\beta})\\sigma}{b}\n$$\nGiven $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\beta = 0.05$, we have $z_{1-\\alpha} = z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.95} = 1.645$.\nSubstituting the estimated parameters:\n$$\n\\text{LOD} = \\frac{(1.645 + 1.645)\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{b}} = \\frac{3.29 \\times 0.0411501}{0.800} \\approx 0.16922995\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the LOD is $0.1692$ ng/mL.\n\n### 3. Derivation and Calculation of LOQ\n\nThe LOQ is defined as the smallest concentration for which the coefficient of variation (CV) of the inverse-calibrated concentration estimate does not exceed a threshold $\\delta = 0.20$.\n\nThe concentration estimator, $\\hat{c}$, is obtained by inverting the calibration model for a measured signal $S$:\n$$\n\\hat{c} = \\frac{S - a}{b}\n$$\nAssuming the parameters $a$ and $b$ are known from a well-established calibration, the uncertainty in $\\hat{c}$ for a single measurement arises from the noise term $\\varepsilon$. The true concentration is $c$.\nThe expected value of the estimator is:\n$$\nE[\\hat{c}] = E\\left[\\frac{(a+bc+\\varepsilon)-a}{b}\\right] = E\\left[c + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b}\\right] = c\n$$\nThe variance of the estimator is:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\hat{c}) = \\text{Var}\\left(c + \\frac{\\varepsilon}{b}\\right) = \\frac{1}{b^2}\\text{Var}(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{b^2}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the estimator is thus $\\text{SD}(\\hat{c}) = \\sigma/b$.\nThe coefficient of variation, CV, is the standard deviation divided by the mean (the true concentration $c$):\n$$\n\\text{CV}(\\hat{c}) = \\frac{\\text{SD}(\\hat{c})}{c} = \\frac{\\sigma/b}{c}\n$$\nThe LOQ is the concentration $c$ at which this CV equals the target $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\delta = \\frac{\\sigma/b}{\\text{LOQ}}\n$$\nSolving for LOQ:\n$$\n\\text{LOQ} = \\frac{\\sigma}{b\\delta}\n$$\nSubstituting the estimated parameters and the given value of $\\delta=0.20$:\n$$\n\\text{LOQ} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{b}\\delta} = \\frac{0.0411501}{0.800 \\times 0.20} = \\frac{0.0411501}{0.160} \\approx 0.257188\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the LOQ is $0.2572$ ng/mL.\nThe final ordered pair $(\\text{LOD}, \\text{LOQ})$ is $(0.1692, 0.2572)$ ng/mL.",

Rearranging the inequality above:\n$$\\frac{|x_2 - x_1|}{\\mu} > z \\sqrt{2(CV_a^2 + CV_i^2)}$$\nThus, the general expression for the minimum relative change threshold is $z\\sqrt{2(CV_a^2 + CV_i^2)}$.\n\nFor the second task, we must compute the absolute change threshold for the given scenario. The absolute change threshold is the minimum value of $|x_2 - x_1|$ that indicates significance. From the inequality, this is:\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} = z \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\mu \\cdot \\sqrt{CV_a^2 + CV_i^2}$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$CV_a = 0.06$\n$CV_i = 0.18$\n$z = 1.96$\nThe true mean $\\mu$ is unknown, and the problem instructs to use the baseline measurement, $x_1 = 35$ ng/L, as a plug-in estimator for $\\mu$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula for the absolute threshold:\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} = 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot (35) \\cdot \\sqrt{(0.06)^2 + (0.18)^2}$$\nFirst, we compute the sum of the squared coefficients of variation:\n$$CV_a^2 + CV_i^2 = (0.06)^2 + (0.18)^2 = 0.0036 + 0.0324 = 0.036$$\nNow, substitute this value back into the threshold expression:\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} = 1.96 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\cdot 35 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.036}$$\nLet's combine the terms under the square root:\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} = 1.96 \\cdot 35 \\cdot \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 0.036} = 68.6 \\cdot \\sqrt{0.072}$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.072} \\approx 0.268328$$\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} \\approx 68.6 \\cdot 0.268328 \\approx 18.407309...$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{Threshold}_{\\text{abs}} \\approx 18.4$$\nThe unit for this threshold is ng/L.",
