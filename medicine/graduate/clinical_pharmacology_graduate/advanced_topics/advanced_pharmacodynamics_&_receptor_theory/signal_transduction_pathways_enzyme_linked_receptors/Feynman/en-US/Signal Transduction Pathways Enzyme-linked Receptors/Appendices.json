The definitions for the dissociation constant, receptor conservation, and occupancy are standard and correct. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to derive the required expression and perform the calculation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unrealistic assumptions. The values given ($K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $\\theta = 0.9$) are well within realistic ranges for pharmacological systems.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Occupancy Equation**\nThe objective is to express the receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. We begin with the provided definitions.\n\nThe definition of receptor occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R_T]}\n$$\nFrom the conservation of receptors, we know that the total receptor concentration $[R_T]$ is the sum of the free receptor concentration $[R]$ and the ligand-bound receptor concentration $[RL]$:\n$$\n[R_T] = [R] + [RL]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta$ gives:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}\n$$\nTo proceed, we must eliminate the term $[R]$. The definition of the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ provides the necessary relationship:\n$$\nK_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the free receptor concentration $[R]$:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ back into our equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d [RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}\n$$\nThe term $[RL]$ is common to all terms in the fraction. Assuming that binding occurs, $[RL] > 0$, so we can cancel it from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $[L]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1 \\cdot [L]}{\\left(\\frac{K_d}{[L]} + 1\\right) \\cdot [L]} = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the steady-state receptor occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_d$. This is a specific form of the Hill-Langmuir equation.\n\n**Calculation of Ligand Concentration**\nThe second part of the problem requires us to determine the free ligand concentration $[L]$ that yields an occupancy of $\\theta = 0.9$ when the dissociation constant is $K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. We use the equation we just derived:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_d + [L]}\n$$\nWe substitute the given values, $\\theta = 0.9$ and $K_d = 10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\n0.9 = \\frac{[L]}{10\\,\\mathrm{nM} + [L]}\n$$\nNow, we solve this algebraic equation for $[L]$. First, multiply both sides by the denominator, $(10\\,\\mathrm{nM} + [L])$:\n$$\n0.9 \\cdot (10\\,\\mathrm{nM} + [L]) = [L]\n$$\nDistribute the $0.9$ on the left-hand side:\n$$\n(0.9 \\cdot 10)\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 0.9[L] = [L]\n$$\n$$\n9\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 0.9[L] = [L]\n$$\nTo isolate $[L]$, we gather all terms involving $[L]$ on one side of the equation:\n$$\n9\\,\\mathrm{nM} = [L] - 0.9[L]\n$$\n$$\n9\\,\\mathrm{nM} = (1 - 0.9)[L]\n$$\n$$\n9\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 0.1[L]\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $[L]$ by dividing by $0.1$:\n$$\n[L] = \\frac{9\\,\\mathrm{nM}}{0.1}\n$$\n$$\n[L] = 90\\,\\mathrm{nM}\n$$\nThus, a free ligand concentration of $90\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ is required to achieve $90\\%$ receptor occupancy when the dissociation constant is $10\\,\\mathrm{nM}$. The final answer should be expressed in nanomolar (nM) as a numerical value.",

The scenario describes a competitive inhibitor of a kinase (MEK), for which ATP is the substrate. This is a standard and scientifically accurate context. The use of Michaelis–Menten kinetics and the concept of competitive inhibition are fundamental principles. The given values for $K_m$ and intracellular ATP concentrations are biologically realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the calculation of a specific, computable quantity (fold-change in $IC_{50}$) based on a clearly defined kinetic model.

Although the inhibitor constant $K_i$ is given, it is not strictly necessary for calculating the fold-change, as will be shown. This does not represent a contradiction but rather a common scenario in problem design. The units ($\\mathrm{nM}$ and $\\mathrm{mM}$) are consistent and standard.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Proceeding to the solution.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the relationship between the half-maximal inhibitory concentration ($IC_{50}$) and the inhibitor constant ($K_i$) for a competitive inhibitor. The problem specifies an ATP-competitive inhibitor, meaning the inhibitor competes with the substrate, ATP, for binding to the enzyme's active site.\n\nFor a competitive inhibitor under the specified assumptions (rapid equilibrium binding), the apparent $IC_{50}$ is related to the inhibitor's intrinsic affinity ($K_i$) and the substrate concentration ($[S]$) by the Cheng-Prusoff equation:\n$$\nIC_{50} = K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[S]}{K_m} \\right)\n$$\nIn this specific context, the substrate $S$ is ATP, so the equation becomes:\n$$\nIC_{50} = K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[ATP]}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} \\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to compute the fold-change in $IC_{50}$ when the ATP concentration increases from an initial value $[ATP]_1$ to a final value $[ATP]_2$. Let the corresponding $IC_{50}$ values be $IC_{50,1}$ and $IC_{50,2}$.\n\nAt the initial ATP concentration, $[ATP]_1 = 1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$:\n$$\nIC_{50,1} = K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[ATP]_1}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} \\right)\n$$\nAt the final ATP concentration, $[ATP]_2 = 5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$:\n$$\nIC_{50,2} = K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[ATP]_2}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} \\right)\n$$\nThe fold-change is the ratio of the final value to the initial value:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{IC_{50,2}}{IC_{50,1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $IC_{50,1}$ and $IC_{50,2}$:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[ATP]_2}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} \\right)}{K_i \\left( 1 + \\frac{[ATP]_1}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} \\right)}\n$$\nThe inhibitor constant $K_i$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. This demonstrates that the fold-change in $IC_{50}$ due to a change in substrate concentration is independent of the inhibitor's intrinsic potency, a characteristic feature of competitive inhibition. The value $K_i = 10 \\ \\mathrm{nM}$ is therefore not required for this specific calculation.\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[ATP]_2}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}}}{1 + \\frac{[ATP]_1}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n-   $[ATP]_1 = 1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n-   $[ATP]_2 = 5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n-   $K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}} = 0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$\n\nThe units of concentration ($\\mathrm{mM}$) are consistent, so they will cancel in the ratios.\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless ratios of substrate concentration to the Michaelis constant:\n$$\n\\frac{[ATP]_1}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} = \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}{0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}} = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{[ATP]_2}{K_m^{\\mathrm{ATP}}} = \\frac{5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}}{0.1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}} = 50\n$$\nNow, substitute these values back into the fold-change expression:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{1 + 50}{1 + 10} = \\frac{51}{11}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\n\\text{Fold-change} = \\frac{51}{11} \\approx 4.636363...\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $4.64$.\n\nThis result indicates that increasing the intracellular ATP concentration from $1 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$ to $5 \\ \\mathrm{mM}$ makes the competitive MEK inhibitor approximately $4.64$ times less potent, as reflected by the increase in its apparent $IC_{50}$. This is an expected outcome for a competitive inhibitor, as higher substrate concentration requires a higher inhibitor concentration to achieve the same level of inhibition.",

            "problem": "A skeletal muscle cell increases glucose uptake in response to insulin via an enzyme-linked receptor, the insulin receptor (IR), which is a receptor tyrosine kinase.
