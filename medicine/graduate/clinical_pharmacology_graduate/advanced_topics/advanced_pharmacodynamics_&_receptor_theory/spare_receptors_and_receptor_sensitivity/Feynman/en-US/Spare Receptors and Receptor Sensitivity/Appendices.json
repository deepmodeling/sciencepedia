Consider a homogeneous receptor population with a single binding site per receptor and assume equilibrium has been reached.

All necessary information to compute the fractional receptor occupancy is provided, and the concepts are fundamental to receptor pharmacology.\n\nThe interaction between the ligand $A$ and the receptor $R$ is given by the reversible reaction:\n$$\nA + R \\rightleftharpoons AR\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the dissociation constant, $K_D$, is defined by the concentrations of the reactants and products:\n$$\nK_D = \\frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}\n$$\nwhere $[A]$ is the concentration of the free ligand, $[R]$ is the concentration of the free (unoccupied) receptor, and $[AR]$ is the concentration of the ligand-receptor complex (occupied receptor).\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R]_T$, is the sum of the concentrations of free and occupied receptors:\n$$\n[R]_T = [R] + [AR]\n$$\nThe fraction of occupied receptors, which we denote as $\\theta$, is the ratio of the concentration of occupied receptors to the total receptor concentration:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AR]}{[R]_T}\n$$\nOur goal is to express $\\theta$ in terms of the known quantities, $[A]$ and $K_D$.\n\nFrom the definition of $K_D$, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$\n[R] = \\frac{K_D [AR]}{[A]}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the total receptor concentration:\n$$\n[R]_T = \\frac{K_D [AR]}{[A]} + [AR]\n$$\nFactoring out $[AR]$ on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n[R]_T = [AR] \\left( \\frac{K_D}{[A]} + 1 \\right)\n$$\nTo find the fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio $\\frac{[AR]}{[R]_T}$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[AR]}{[R]_T} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[A]} + 1}\n$$\nBy multiplying the numerator and the denominator by $[A]$, we obtain the more common form of the Hill-Langmuir equation for a single binding site:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[A]}{K_D + [A]}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\nLigand concentration, $[A] = 20$ nM.\nDissociation constant, $K_D = 100$ nM.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{20 \\text{ nM}}{100 \\text{ nM} + 20 \\text{ nM}} = \\frac{20}{120} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.16666... \\approx 0.1667\n$$\nThus, at a ligand concentration of $20$ nM, approximately $16.67\\%$ of the receptors are occupied.\n\nThe interpretation of this result in the context of spare receptors and sensitivity is as follows. The concept of \"spare receptors\" (or receptor reserve) describes a common physiological phenomenon where the maximal biological response ($E_{max}$) of a tissue or cell to an agonist is achieved when only a fraction of the total available receptors is occupied. The receptors that are not required for the maximal response are considered \"spare\".\n\nOur calculation shows a fractional occupancy of $\\theta \\approx 0.1667$. If the biological system in question exhibits a maximal response at this level of occupancy (or an even lower one), it demonstrates the existence of a significant receptor reserve. This situation has a critical implication for the sensitivity of the system to the ligand. The presence of spare receptors allows the concentration-response curve to be shifted to the left of the concentration-binding curve. This means the concentration of ligand required to produce $50\\%$ of the maximal effect ($EC_{50}$) is lower than the concentration required to occupy $50\\%$ of the receptors (the $K_D$). In this problem, the applied ligand concentration ($[A] = 20$ nM) is only one-fifth of the $K_D$ ($100$ nM), yet it could elicit a substantial, or even maximal, response in a system with a large receptor reserve. This demonstrates enhanced sensitivity, as the system can react robustly to ligand concentrations that are well below the dissociation constant. In essence, spare receptors provide a mechanism for signal amplification, enabling a strong physiological output from a relatively weak input signal (i.e., low ligand concentration).",

            "solution": "This problem will be addressed by first deriving the expression for the half-maximal effective concentration ($\\mathrm{EC50}$) from the principles of the operational model of agonism. Subsequently, this expression will be used to calculate the fold-change in potency upon reduction of receptor density for three different initial conditions. Finally, the results will be interpreted in the context of spare receptors and receptor sensitivity.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the $\\mathrm{EC50}$ Expression**\n\nThe operational model of agonism describes the response, $E$, as a function of the agonist concentration, $[A]$. The process begins with the binding of the agonist $A$ to the receptor $R$ to form an agonist-receptor complex $AR$. At equilibrium, the concentration of this complex, $[AR]$, is given by the law of mass action:\n$$[AR] = \\frac{R_T [A]}{K_A + [A]}$$\nwhere $R_T$ is the total receptor density and $K_A$ is the equilibrium dissociation constant of the agonist.\n\nThe core of the operational model posits that the biological stimulus, $S$, is proportional to the concentration of occupied receptors, $[AR]$, and the response $E$ is a hyperbolic function of this stimulus. The stimulus is given by $S = \\varepsilon[AR]$, where $\\varepsilon$ is the intrinsic efficacy of the agonist. The stimulus-response relationship is often modeled as:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} S}{S + K_E}$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the maximum response of the tissue and $K_E$ is the stimulus value that produces a half-maximal response ($50\\%$ of $E_{\\mathrm{m}}$).\n\nSubstituting the expression for $[AR]$ into the stimulus-response equation, with $S = \\varepsilon[AR]$ is cumbersome. A more direct formulation of the operational model, as described by Black and Leff, combines these steps. The response $E$ is related to $[AR]$ by:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} [AR]}{K_E + [AR]}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[AR]$:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\frac{R_T [A]}{K_A + [A]}}{K_E + \\frac{R_T [A]}{K_A + [A]}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(K_A + [A])$ yields:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} R_T [A]}{K_E (K_A + [A]) + R_T [A]}$$\nThe transduction coefficient, $\\tau$, is defined as the ratio of the total receptor density to the stimulus coupling constant, $\\tau = \\frac{R_T}{K_E}$. This allows us to re-parameterize the equation in terms of $\\tau$. Substituting $K_E = \\frac{R_T}{\\tau}$:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} R_T [A]}{\\frac{R_T}{\\tau} (K_A + [A]) + R_T [A]}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $R_T$:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} [A]}{\\frac{1}{\\tau} (K_A + [A]) + [A]}$$\nRearranging the denominator:\n$$E = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} [A]}{\\frac{K_A}{\\tau} + \\frac{[A]}{\\tau} + [A]} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} [A]}{\\frac{K_A}{\\tau} + [A] \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\right)} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} [A]}{\\frac{K_A}{\\tau} + [A] \\left( \\frac{\\tau+1}{\\tau} \\right)}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\tau$ gives the final form of the operational model equation:\n$$E([A]) = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau [A]}{K_A + (\\tau+1)[A]}$$\nThe problem asks for the half-maximal effective concentration, $\\mathrm{EC50}$. It is standard pharmacological practice to define $\\mathrm{EC50}$ as the concentration of agonist that produces $50\\%$ of its *own* maximal effect, which we denote as $E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}}$. This maximum effect is found by taking the limit as $[A] \\to \\infty$:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}} = \\lim_{[A] \\to \\infty} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau [A]}{K_A + (\\tau+1)[A]} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau}{\\tau+1}$$\nAn agonist is considered a \"full agonist\" if its $E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}}$ is equal or very close to the system maximum, $E_{\\mathrm{m}}$. This requires a large value of $\\tau$. The problem uses the label \"full agonist\" while testing cases where $\\tau$ is small, implying a broader use of the term for the drug type being studied. The derivation remains valid by defining $\\mathrm{EC50}$ relative to $E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}}$.\n\nWe now solve for the concentration $[A] = \\mathrm{EC50}$ where $E(\\mathrm{EC50}) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\mathrm{max, agonist}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau}{\\tau+1} \\right)$$\nSetting this equal to the response equation:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau}{2(\\tau+1)} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau \\cdot \\mathrm{EC50}}{K_A + (\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50}}$$\nWe can cancel the $E_{\\mathrm{m}} \\tau$ term from both sides (assuming $\\tau > 0$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2(\\tau+1)} = \\frac{\\mathrm{EC50}}{K_A + (\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50}}$$\nCross-multiplication gives:\n$$K_A + (\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50} = 2(\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50}$$\nSolving for $K_A$:\n$$K_A = 2(\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50} - (\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50} = (\\tau+1)\\mathrm{EC50}$$\nThis yields the desired expression for $\\mathrm{EC50}$:\n$$\\mathrm{EC50} = \\frac{K_A}{\\tau+1}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Fold-Change in Potency**\n\nWe are given an initial (\"old\") state with a transduction coefficient $\\tau_{\\text{old}}$. The potency in this state is characterized by $\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{old}}$.\n$$\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{old}} = \\frac{K_A}{\\tau_{\\text{old}}+1}$$\nExperimentally, the total receptor density $R_T$ is halved. Since $\\tau$ is proportional to $R_T$, the new transduction coefficient, $\\tau_{\\text{new}}$, is also halved:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}}{2}$$\nThe potency in this new state is characterized by $\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{new}}$:\n$$\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{new}} = \\frac{K_A}{\\tau_{\\text{new}}+1} = \\frac{K_A}{\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{old}}}{2}+1}$$\nThe problem asks for the fold-change in potency, defined as the ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{new}}}{\\mathrm{EC50}_{\\text{old}}}$.

This nonlinearity is fundamental to the concept of **spare receptors** (or receptor reserve) and **receptor sensitivity**.\n\nThe term \"spare receptors\" describes a situation where a maximal or near-maximal physiological response can be elicited by an agonist at a concentration where not all available receptors are occupied. In the operational model, a large value of $\\tau$ signifies a large receptor reserve. Conversely, a small $\\tau$ indicates little to no receptor reserve. The expression $\\mathrm{EC50} = \\frac{K_A}{\\tau+1}$ quantifies this:\n- When $\\tau$ is large (large reserve), $\\mathrm{EC50}$ is much smaller than $K_A$. The agonist is highly potent, requiring only a low concentration (and thus low fractional receptor occupancy) to achieve $50\\%$ of its effect.\n- When $\\tau$ is small (low reserve, e.g., $\\tau \\to 0$), $\\mathrm{EC50}$ approaches $K_A$. Potency is low, and the dose-response curve more closely reflects the receptor-binding curve.\n\nReceptor sensitivity, in this context, refers to how significantly the agonist's potency is affected by a change in receptor density ($R_T$, which determines $\\tau$). Our calculated fold-changes demonstrate this sensitivity.\n\n- **High $\\tau$ (e.g., $\\tau=5$):** The system has a large receptor reserve. The fold-change in $\\mathrm{EC50}$ is $\\frac{12}{7} \\approx 1.71$. Halving the number of receptors causes a substantial ($71\\%$) increase in $\\mathrm{EC50}$, meaning a significant drop in potency. The system is highly sensitive to the loss of receptors because its high initial potency was directly dependent on the large \"buffer\" provided by the spare receptors. Losing half of this buffer forces the system to require a much higher agonist concentration to generate the same stimulus. In the limit as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, the fold-change approaches $\\lim_{\\tau \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\tau+2}{\\tau+2} = 2$, meaning halving the receptors nearly doubles the $\\mathrm{EC50}$.\n\n- **Low $\\tau$ (e.g., $\\tau=0.5$):** The system has little or no receptor reserve. The fold-change in $\\mathrm{EC50}$ is $\\frac{6}{5} = 1.2$. Halving the already scarce receptors causes only a modest ($20\\%$) increase in $\\mathrm{EC50}$. The system is less sensitive to receptor loss in relative terms. Its potency was already low and closely tied to receptor occupancy; reducing the number of receptors makes an inefficient system even more so, but the relative impact on potency is smaller than in a high-reserve system.\n\nIn conclusion, the effect of altering receptor density on agonist potency is nonlinear because of the amplification between receptor occupancy and response. This amplification, quantified by $\\tau$, creates the phenomenon of spare receptors. Systems with a large receptor reserve are more sensitive to receptor downregulation, exhibiting a larger drop in potency for the same fractional loss of receptors compared to systems with no reserve.",
