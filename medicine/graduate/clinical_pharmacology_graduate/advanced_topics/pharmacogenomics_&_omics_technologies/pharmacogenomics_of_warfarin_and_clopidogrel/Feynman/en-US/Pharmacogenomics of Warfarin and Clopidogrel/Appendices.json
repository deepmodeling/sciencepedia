            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Patient: $58$-year-old initiating racemic warfarin.\n- Genotype: Normal Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) sensitivity. Heterozygous reduced-function Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) allele.\n- Pharmacokinetic Parameter Change: The intrinsic clearance ($CL$) of S-warfarin is predicted to decrease by $30\\%$ relative to a reference individual.\n- Assumption 1: Linear pharmacokinetics apply to S-warfarin.\n- Assumption 2: Oral bioavailability ($F$) is unchanged.\n- Assumption 3: The dosing interval ($\\tau$) is fixed.\n- Assumption 4: The pharmacodynamic target (International Normalized Ratio, INR) and sensitivity (VKORC1) are unchanged.\n- Goal: Maintain the same S-warfarin exposure.\n- Task 1: Derive an expression relating the required maintenance dose to clearance when maintaining the same exposure.\n- Task 2: Determine the multiplicative factor by which the maintenance dose should be adjusted, expressed as the ratio $\\dfrac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}}$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem accurately describes a fundamental scenario in pharmacogenomics. Warfarin is a racemic mixture, with the S-enantiomer being more potent. S-warfarin is principally metabolized by the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C9, and its target is VKORC1. A reduced-function CYP2C9 allele is known to decrease S-warfarin clearance, necessitating a lower dose. The use of pharmacokinetic principles such as clearance, bioavailability, and steady-state concentration is appropriate and standard. The premises are factually correct within the context of clinical pharmacology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is self-contained. The goal to \"maintain the same S-warfarin exposure\" provides a clear, formalizable objective. The assumptions of linear kinetics, constant bioavailability, and a fixed dosing interval are sufficient to establish a unique relationship between dose and clearance. The question asks for a specific, calculable ratio.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language (e.g., \"$30\\%$ decrease\") and established scientific terms. It is free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A formal solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem requires maintaining the same S-warfarin exposure at steady-state. For a drug exhibiting linear pharmacokinetics, exposure over a dosing interval, $\\tau$, at steady-state ($ss$) is quantified by the Area Under the plasma concentration-time Curve, $AUC_{\\tau,ss}$. The average steady-state plasma concentration, $C_{ss,avg}$, is directly proportional to this exposure, defined as:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{AUC_{\\tau,ss}}{\\tau}$$\nThe fundamental equation for the average steady-state concentration of a drug administered orally is given by:\n$$C_{ss,avg} = \\frac{F \\cdot D}{CL \\cdot \\tau}$$\nwhere $D$ is the maintenance dose administered every interval $\\tau$, $F$ is the fraction of the dose that is bioavailable, and $CL$ is the total body clearance of the drug.\n\nThe problem's central condition is that the exposure must be the same for the patient (new) as for a reference individual (old). Since the dosing interval $\\tau$ is constant, this is equivalent to requiring the average steady-state concentrations to be equal.\n$$C_{ss,avg,new} = C_{ss,avg,old}$$\nSubstituting the general expression for $C_{ss,avg}$ into this equality yields:\n$$\\frac{F_{new} \\cdot D_{new}}{CL_{new} \\cdot \\tau_{new}} = \\frac{F_{old} \\cdot D_{old}}{CL_{old} \\cdot \\tau_{old}}$$\nThe problem states several simplifying conditions: bioavailability $F$ is unchanged ($F_{new} = F_{old}$), and the dosing interval $\\tau$ is fixed ($\\tau_{new} = \\tau_{old}$). Applying these constraints allows us to cancel these terms from the equation:\n$$\\frac{D_{new}}{CL_{new}} = \\frac{D_{old}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThis equation is the expression relating the maintenance dose to clearance under the condition of constant exposure. It shows that to maintain a target steady-state concentration, the maintenance dose must be directly proportional to the drug's clearance. We can express this relationship as $D = k \\cdot CL$, where the constant of proportionality is $k = \\frac{C_{ss,avg} \\cdot \\tau}{F}$, which is fixed since the target exposure ($C_{ss,avg}$), dosing interval ($\\tau$), and bioavailability ($F$) are all constant.\n\nThe next task is to find the multiplicative factor for the dose adjustment, which is the ratio $\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}}$. Rearranging the derived relationship gives:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{CL_{new}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThe problem states that the patient's S-warfarin clearance, $CL_{new}$, is decreased by $30\\%$ relative to the reference clearance, $CL_{old}$. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$CL_{new} = CL_{old} - 0.30 \\cdot CL_{old}$$\nFactoring out $CL_{old}$ gives:\n$$CL_{new} = (1 - 0.30) \\cdot CL_{old}$$\n$$CL_{new} = 0.70 \\cdot CL_{old}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $CL_{new}$ back into the dose ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = \\frac{0.70 \\cdot CL_{old}}{CL_{old}}$$\nThe term $CL_{old}$ cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding the final multiplicative factor:\n$$\\frac{D_{\\text{new}}}{D_{\\text{old}}} = 0.70$$\nThis result indicates that the maintenance dose for the patient with reduced CYP2C9 activity should be $70\\%$ of the dose for a reference individual to achieve the same therapeutic exposure to S-warfarin.",

            "problem": "A tertiary cardiac center is considering routine point-of-care pharmacogenomic testing to guide P2Y12 receptor inhibitor therapy after drug-eluting stent implantation. The clinical mechanism is that clopidogrel is a prodrug requiring biotransformation by cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) to its active thiol; carriers of loss-of-function (LOF) CYP2C19 alleles have reduced active metabolite exposure and higher stent thrombosis risk when maintained on clopidogrel. An alternative inhibitor that does not require CYP2C19 activation is available and, when used in true LOF carriers, produces an absolute reduction in 12-month stent thrombosis risk relative to remaining on clopidogrel. While pharmacogenomic loci such as Vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) and cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) are critical for warfarin dose individualization, this question focuses on clopidogrel and cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19).\n\nAssume the following for a 12-month decision horizon:\n- The prevalence of CYP2C19 LOF carriers in the treated population is $0.15$.\n- A same-day CYP2C19 genotyping assay has sensitivity $0.95$ for detecting LOF carrier status. For the purpose of quantifying benefit, assume that changes in therapy for non-carriers do not change their stent thrombosis risk.\n- Among true LOF carriers who are identified and switched to the alternative inhibitor based on the genotype, the absolute risk reduction in stent thrombosis over $12$ months compared with remaining on clopidogrel is $0.015$.\n- Among patients with a positive genotype result indicating LOF carriage, the proportion who are successfully switched to and maintained on the alternative inhibitor is $0.90$ over the $12$ months.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions of absolute risk, absolute risk reduction, test sensitivity, and the law of total expectation, derive an expression for, and then calculate, the number needed to genotype (i.e., the number of patients who must undergo genotyping under this implementation to prevent one stent thrombosis event over $12$ months).

Among those identified, a fraction $u$ is successfully switched and maintained on the alternative inhibitor. For each such switched true carrier, the absolute reduction in stent thrombosis risk is $a$ (by definition of absolute risk reduction).

            "problem": "A clinical pharmacogenomics laboratory is validating a limited genotyping panel for Cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) to support warfarin dosing in an African ancestry cohort. Warfarin metabolism is primarily mediated by CYP2C9, and decreased-function star alleles alter metabolizer status. The cohort is assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, and alleles are randomly paired at meiosis (Mendelian segregation). Consider only the following CYP2C9 star alleles: $^{\\*}1$ (normal function), $^{\\*}2$, $^{\\*}3$, $^{\\*}5$, $^{\\*}6$, $^{\\*}8$, and $^{\\*}11$; other alleles are negligible in frequency for the purpose of this calculation. The laboratory’s panel detects only $^{\\*}2$ and $^{\\*}3$ and classifies metabolizer status based on the count of detected decreased-function alleles, treating any allele not explicitly detected by the panel as $^{\\*}1$.\n\nAssume the following allele frequencies in this African ancestry cohort: $f(^{\\*}1)=0.83$, $f(^{\\*}2)=0.02$, $f(^{\\*}3)=0.01$, $f(^{\\*}5)=0.03$, $f(^{\\*}6)=0.01$, $f(^{\\*}8)=0.08$, and $f(^{\\*}11)=0.02$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is based on standard principles of population genetics (Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) and their application in pharmacogenomics, a recognized area of clinical pharmacology. The provided allele frequencies sum to $1$, and all terms are clearly defined, making the problem self-contained and solvable. Thus, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first categorizing the alleles, then calculating the frequencies of all possible genotype groups, determining the \"true\" and \"panel-based\" metabolizer status for each group, and finally summing the frequencies of the groups where the statuses are discordant.\n\nFirst, we define three mutually exclusive sets of alleles based on the problem description:\n1.  The normal function allele, which we denote as $A_N$: $A_N = \\{^{\\*}1\\}$. Its frequency is $p_N = f(^{\\*}1) = 0.83$.\n2.  The set of decreased-function alleles that are detected by the panel, denoted as $A_D$: $A_D = \\{^{\\*}2, ^{\\*}3\\}$. The total frequency of this set is the sum of the individual allele frequencies: $p_D = f(^{\\*}2) + f(^{\\*}3) = 0.02 + 0.01 = 0.03$.\n3.  The set of decreased-function alleles that are not detected by the panel, denoted as $A_U$: $A_U = \\{^{\\*}5, ^{\\*}6, ^{\\*}8, ^{\\*}11\\}$. The total frequency of this set is $p_U = f(^{\\*}5) + f(^{\\*}6) + f(^{\\*}8) + f(^{\\*}11) = 0.03 + 0.01 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.14$.\n\nThe sum of these frequencies must be $1$: $p_N + p_D + p_U = 0.83 + 0.03 + 0.14 = 1.00$. This confirms the consistency of the provided data.\n\nUnder the assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of diploid genotypes formed from these allele groups are:\n-   $(A_X, A_X)$: frequency $p_X^2$\n-   $(A_X, A_Y)$: frequency $2 p_X p_Y$ for $X \\neq Y$\n\nThere are six possible genotype groups based on our categorization: $(A_N, A_N)$, $(A_D, A_D)$, $(A_U, A_U)$, $(A_N, A_D)$, $(A_N, A_U)$, and $(A_D, A_U)$. We will now determine the true and panel-based metabolizer status for each.\n\nThe total set of decreased-function alleles for determining the true status is $A_{DF} = A_D \\cup A_U$, with frequency $p_{DF} = p_D + p_U = 0.17$.\n-   **True Status**:\n    -   Normal Metabolizer (NM): $0$ decreased-function alleles. Genotype: $(A_N, A_N)$.\n    -   Intermediate Metabolizer (IM): $1$ decreased-function allele. Genotypes: $(A_N, A_D)$ and $(A_N, A_U)$.\n    -   Poor Metabolizer (PM): $2$ decreased-function alleles. Genotypes: $(A_D, A_D)$, $(A_U, A_U)$, and $(A_D, A_U)$.\n\n-   **Panel-Based Status**: The panel treats any allele from $A_U$ as a normal allele $A_N$.\n    -   Panel NM: $0$ detected decreased-function ($A_D$) alleles. Any genotype without an $A_D$ allele. Genotypes: $(A_N, A_N)$, $(A_N, A_U)$, $(A_U, A_U)$.\n    -   Panel IM: $1$ detected decreased-function ($A_D$) allele. Genotypes: $(A_N, A_D)$, $(A_D, A_U)$.\n    -   Panel PM: $2$ detected decreased-function ($A_D$) alleles. Genotype: $(A_D, A_D)$.\n\nWe can now identify which genotype groups are misclassified by comparing their true and panel-based statuses. A misclassification occurs if the two statuses differ.\n\n1.  Genotype $(A_N, A_N)$: True Status is NM. Panel Status is NM. **Correctly classified.**\n2.  Genotype $(A_N, A_D)$: True Status is IM. Panel Status is IM. **Correctly classified.**\n3.  Genotype $(A_D, A_D)$: True Status is PM. Panel Status is PM. **Correctly classified.**\n4.  Genotype $(A_N, A_U)$: True Status is IM. Panel Status is NM. **Misclassified.**\n5.  Genotype $(A_U, A_U)$: True Status is PM. Panel Status is NM. **Misclassified.**\n6.  Genotype $(A_D, A_U)$: True Status is PM. Panel Status is IM. **Misclassified.**\n\nThe total misclassification rate, $R_{misc}$, is the sum of the frequencies of the misclassified genotype groups.\n$$R_{misc} = \\text{freq}(A_N, A_U) + \\text{freq}(A_U, A_U) + \\text{freq}(A_D, A_U)$$\nUsing the HWE principle:\n$$R_{misc} = (2 p_N p_U) + (p_U^2) + (2 p_D p_U)$$\nWe can factor out $p_U$:\n$$R_{misc} = p_U (2 p_N + p_U + 2 p_D)$$\nRearranging terms inside the parenthesis:\n$$R_{misc} = p_U ( (p_N + p_D + p_U) + (p_N + p_D) )$$\nSince $p_N + p_D + p_U = 1$, and $p_N + p_D = 1 - p_U$:\n$$R_{misc} = p_U ( 1 + (1 - p_U) ) = p_U (2 - p_U)$$\nThis expression represents the rate of misclassification.\n\nAn alternative logical derivation confirms this result. A misclassification occurs if and only if an individual carries at least one undetected allele from the set $A_U$. The frequency of individuals who do *not* carry any allele from $A_U$ is the frequency of having genotypes formed exclusively from the $A_N$ and $A_D$ allele pools. The combined frequency of these \"correctly classifiable\" alleles is $p_N + p_D$. Under HWE, the frequency of individuals with genotypes composed solely of these alleles is $(p_N + p_D)^2$. This is the rate of correct classification, $R_{correct}$.\n$$R_{correct} = (p_N + p_D)^2$$\nSince $p_N + p_D = 1 - p_U$, we have:\n$$R_{correct} = (1 - p_U)^2$$\nThe misclassification rate is the complement of the correct classification rate:\n$$R_{misc} = 1 - R_{correct} = 1 - (1 - p_U)^2$$\nExpanding the squared term gives:\n$$R_{misc} = 1 - (1 - 2 p_U + p_U^2) = 1 - 1 + 2 p_U - p_U^2 = 2 p_U - p_U^2$$\nFactoring out $p_U$ yields the same expression as before:\n$$R_{misc} = p_U (2 - p_U)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for $p_U$.\n$$p_U = 0.14$$\n$$R_{misc} = 0.14 \\times (2 - 0.14) = 0.14 \\times 1.86$$\n$$R_{misc} = 0.2604$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.2604$ already has four significant figures.",
