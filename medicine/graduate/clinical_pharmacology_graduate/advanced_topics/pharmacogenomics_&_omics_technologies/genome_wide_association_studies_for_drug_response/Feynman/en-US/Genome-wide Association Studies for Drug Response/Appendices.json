The study enrolls subjects from a large source population in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE) at this locus, where the minor allele frequency is $q=0.3$ and the major allele frequency is $p=1-q$. Due to genotype-dependent adverse events, the probability of remaining on therapy to week $12$ (that is, being in the drug-exposed cohort at week $12$) is $s_{AA}=0.85$, $s_{Aa}=0.60$, and $s_{aa}=0.15$ for genotypes $AA$, $Aa$, and $aa$, respectively.

It involves Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium, allele frequencies, and natural selection (modeled as genotype-dependent drug discontinuation). The calculation of an inbreeding coefficient in a post-selection cohort is a standard exercise. All concepts are fundamental to the field.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary information to calculate the post-selection genotype and allele frequencies, and subsequently, the inbreeding coefficient.

The parameters are clearly defined, and there are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined problem in population genetics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Detailed Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first calculating the genotype frequencies in the source population, then applying the selection pressures (drug discontinuation probabilities) to find the genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort, and finally using these new frequencies to calculate the inbreeding coefficient $F$.\n\n1.  **Initial Genotype Frequencies in the Source Population**\n\nThe source population is in Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (HWE). The allele frequencies are given as:\n- Frequency of major allele $A$: $p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7$\n- Frequency of minor allele $a$: $q = 0.3$\n\nUnder HWE, the genotype frequencies at baseline are:\n- Frequency of $AA$: $P_{AA} = p^2 = (0.7)^2 = 0.49$\n- Frequency of $Aa$: $P_{Aa} = 2pq = 2(0.7)(0.3) = 0.42$\n- Frequency of $aa$: $P_{aa} = q^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09$\nThe sum of these frequencies is $0.49 + 0.42 + 0.09 = 1.0$, as expected.\n\n2.  **Genotype Frequencies in the Week 12 Cohort**\n\nThe probabilities of remaining on therapy, $s_{AA}=0.85$, $s_{Aa}=0.60$, and $s_{aa}=0.15$, act as selection coefficients. We apply these multiplicatively to the baseline genotype frequencies to find the proportional representation of each genotype in the week $12$ cohort.\n\nThe unnormalized frequencies are:\n- $P_{AA} \\times s_{AA} = 0.49 \\times 0.85 = 0.4165$\n- $P_{Aa} \\times s_{Aa} = 0.42 \\times 0.60 = 0.2520$\n- $P_{aa} \\times s_{aa} = 0.09 \\times 0.15 = 0.0135$\n\nTo find the new genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort, we must normalize by the sum of these values. This sum represents the mean survival rate, $\\bar{s}$.\n$$ \\bar{s} = (P_{AA} \\times s_{AA}) + (P_{Aa} \\times s_{Aa}) + (P_{aa} \\times s_{aa}) $$\n$$ \\bar{s} = 0.4165 + 0.2520 + 0.0135 = 0.6820 $$\n\nThe renormalized genotype frequencies in the week $12$ cohort (let's denote them $P'$) are:\n- $P'_{AA} = \\frac{P_{AA} s_{AA}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.4165}{0.6820}$\n- $P'_{Aa} = \\frac{P_{Aa} s_{Aa}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820}$\n- $P'_{aa} = \\frac{P_{aa} s_{aa}}{\\bar{s}} = \\frac{0.0135}{0.6820}$\n\n3.  **Allele Frequencies in the Week 12 Cohort**\n\nNext, we calculate the allele frequencies, $p'$ and $q'$, in this new cohort.\nThe frequency of allele $A$, $p'$, is the frequency of $AA$ homozygotes plus half the frequency of $Aa$ heterozygotes:\n$$ p' = P'_{AA} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.4165}{0.6820} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{0.4165 + 0.1260}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.5425}{0.6820} $$\nThe frequency of allele $a$, $q'$, is the frequency of $aa$ homozygotes plus half the frequency of $Aa$ heterozygotes:\n$$ q' = P'_{aa} + \\frac{1}{2}P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.0135}{0.6820} + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{0.0135 + 0.1260}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.1395}{0.6820} $$\nAs a check, $p' + q' = \\frac{0.5425 + 0.1395}{0.6820} = \\frac{0.6820}{0.6820} = 1$.\n\n4.  **Calculation of Wright's Inbreeding Coefficient ($F$)**\n\nWright's inbreeding coefficient $F$ measures the deviation of the observed heterozygote frequency from the frequency expected under HWE. The formula is:\n$$ F = \\frac{H_{exp} - H_{obs}}{H_{exp}} = 1 - \\frac{H_{obs}}{H_{exp}} $$\nHere, the observed heterozygote frequency, $H_{obs}$, is the frequency of the $Aa$ genotype in the week $12$ cohort, which is $P'_{Aa}$.\n$$ H_{obs} = P'_{Aa} = \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} $$\nThe expected heterozygote frequency, $H_{exp}$, is the frequency that would be observed in a population with allele frequencies $p'$ and $q'$ if it were in HWE.\n$$ H_{exp} = 2p'q' = 2 \\left( \\frac{0.5425}{0.6820} \\right) \\left( \\frac{0.1395}{0.6820} \\right) = \\frac{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395}{(0.6820)^2} $$\nNow, we substitute these into the formula for $F$:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{0.2520}{0.6820}}{\\frac{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395}{(0.6820)^2}} $$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$ F = 1 - \\left( \\frac{0.2520}{0.6820} \\times \\frac{(0.6820)^2}{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395} \\right) $$\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{0.2520 \\times 0.6820}{2 \\times 0.5425 \\times 0.1395} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical values:\n$$ F = 1 - \\frac{0.171864}{0.1513575} $$\n$$ F = 1 - 1.13549301... $$\n$$ F = -0.13549301... $$\nA negative value for $F$ indicates an excess of heterozygotes in the week $12$ cohort compared to the HWE expectation for the new allele frequencies. This is a consequence of the specific selection pressures.\n\n5.  **Final Answer**\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ F \\approx -0.1355 $$",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the asymptotic Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) rejection threshold for a specific mixture model of $p$-values and its numerical evaluation. The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded in the field of statistical genetics.\n\nLet the $p$-values from $m$ independent tests be $P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_m$. Let the ordered $p$-values be $P_{(1)} \\le P_{(2)} \\le \\ldots \\le P_{(m)}$. The Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure at a False Discovery Rate (FDR) control level $q \\in (0,1)$ finds the largest integer $k$ such that\n$$P_{(k)} \\le \\frac{k}{m}q$$\nAll null hypotheses corresponding to $p$-values $P_i \\le P_{(k)}$ are then rejected. The effective $p$-value threshold for rejection is therefore $\\tau_{BH} = P_{(k)}$.\n\nFor a large number of tests, where $m \\to \\infty$, we can analyze the behavior of the BH procedure in a continuous framework. The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the $p$-values, defined as $\\hat{G}_m(t) = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^m I(P_i \\le t)$, where $I(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function, converges to the true underlying CDF of the $p$-values, $G(t)$, by the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem.\n\nThe term $\\frac{k}{m}$ in the BH inequality represents the proportion of $p$-values that are less than or equal to $P_{(k)}$. This can be written as $\\frac{k}{m} = \\hat{G}_m(P_{(k)})$. Thus, the BH condition for the threshold $P_{(k)}$ can be expressed as:\n$$P_{(k)} \\le \\hat{G}_m(P_{(k)}) q$$\nThe rejection threshold $\\tau$ is the largest $p$-value that satisfies this condition. In the asymptotic limit as $m \\to \\infty$, the ECDF $\\hat{G}_m(t)$ converges to the true CDF $G(t)$. The search for the largest discrete $P_{(k)}$ becomes a search for the largest continuous value $\\tau > 0$ that satisfies the inequality:\n$$\\tau \\le G(\\tau) q$$\nThe boundary of the rejection region, which defines the asymptotic threshold, is given by the largest non-trivial solution to the equation:\n$$\\tau = G(\\tau) q$$\nThe problem specifies the mixture CDF as $G(t) = \\pi_{0}t + (1-\\pi_{0})t^{\\theta}$ for $t \\in [0,1]$, where $\\pi_{0}$ is the proportion of true null hypotheses and $1-\\pi_{0}$ is the proportion of true alternative hypotheses. The distribution under the alternative has a CDF $F_1(t) = t^{\\theta}$ with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$.\n\nSubstituting this form of $G(t)$ into the equation for the asymptotic threshold $\\tau$, we get:\n$$\\tau = \\left[ \\pi_{0}\\tau + (1-\\pi_{0})\\tau^{\\theta} \\right] q$$\nWe seek to solve this equation for $\\tau > 0$. We can expand the right-hand side:\n$$\\tau = q\\pi_{0}\\tau + q(1-\\pi_{0})\\tau^{\\theta}$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we first gather the terms involving $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau - q\\pi_{0}\\tau = q(1-\\pi_{0})\\tau^{\\theta}$$\n$$\\tau(1 - q\\pi_{0}) = q(1-\\pi_{0})\\tau^{\\theta}$$\nSince we are looking for a non-zero threshold, we can assume $\\tau>0$.

We must analyze the genetic associations with both myopathy (an adverse effect) and LDL cholesterol change (the intended therapeutic effect).\n\n### Analysis of Myopathy Association ($Y$)\n\n1.  **Effect of $G$ in the Placebo Arm**: The logistic model for the placebo arm ($D=0$) shows that the coefficient for the genotype, $\\hat{\\beta}_P$, is $0.20$ with a p-value less than $0.001$. This is a statistically significant association. It indicates that the variant $G$ is associated with an increased risk of myopathy even in the *absence* of statin treatment. The per-allele odds ratio is $\\exp(0.20) \\approx 1.22$. This represents a baseline, drug-independent effect of the gene on myopathy risk.\n\n2.  **Effect of $G$ in the Statin Arm**: The model for the statin arm ($D=1$) shows $\\hat{\\beta}_T = 0.22$ ($p  0.001$), which is also highly significant. The per-allele odds ratio is $\\exp(0.22) \\approx 1.25$. This confirms the association between $G$ and myopathy in individuals taking the statin.\n\n3.  **Gene-Drug Interaction for Myopathy**: The interaction model tests whether the effect of $G$ on myopathy risk is different between the placebo and statin arms. The interaction coefficient, $\\psi$, represents the difference in the log-odds ratios: $\\psi = \\beta_T - \\beta_P$. The estimate is $\\hat{\\psi} = 0.22 - 0.20 = 0.02$. This value is small, and its p-value is large ($p=0.76$), indicating no statistically significant evidence of a gene-drug interaction. The effect of variant $G$ on myopathy risk is approximately constant whether or not the individual is taking a statin.\n\n### Analysis of Lipid Response Association ($\\Delta L$)\n\n1.  **Effect of $G$ in the Placebo Arm**: The linear model for lipid change ($\\Delta L$) in the placebo arm ($D=0$) yields a coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_P = 0.10$ with a p-value of $0.73$. This is not statistically significant. It means the variant $G$ has no discernible effect on LDL cholesterol changes in the absence of the drug.\n\n2.  **Effect of $G$ in the Statin Arm**: The model for the statin arm ($D=1$) yields a coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_T = -10.0$ with a p-value $ 10^{-10}$. This is a highly significant association. It indicates that the variant $G$ strongly modulates the LDL-lowering effect of the statin. For each copy of the allele represented by $G$, the statin-induced LDL reduction is greater by $10.0$ $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$. This is a classic pharmacogenomic effect on an on-target efficacy endpoint, representing a strong gene-drug interaction.\n\n### Synthesis and Interpretation of Pleiotropy\n\n-   **Pleiotropy**: The variant $G$ is associated with two distinct phenotypes: myopathy risk and statin-induced LDL response. This is, by definition, pleiotropy.\n-   **Horizontal vs. Vertical Pleiotropy**: The problem defines two types of pleiotropy.\n    -   *Vertical pleiotropy*: $G \\rightarrow \\Delta L \\rightarrow Y$. The effect of the gene on myopathy is mediated through its effect on lipid lowering.\n    -   *Horizontal pleiotropy*: $G$ influences $Y$ and $\\Delta L$ through independent biological pathways.\n-   **Evaluating the evidence**: In the placebo arm, variant $G$ is significantly associated with myopathy ($Y$) but has no association with lipid changes ($\\Delta L$). This observation directly refutes the hypothesis that the effect of $G$ on myopathy is *mediated by* its effect on $\\Delta L$. The pathway from $G$ to myopathy must be, at least in part, independent of the LDL-cholesterol pathway. This is the definition of horizontal pleiotropy. The myopathy risk associated with $G$ is an \"off-target\" effect, as it is unrelated to the drug's intended mechanism of action (lipid lowering).\n-   **Summary**:\n    1.  $G$ has a main effect on myopathy risk, independent of statin treatment. This is evidence of an inherent, off-target susceptibility.\n    2.  $G$ has a pharmacogenomic effect (gene-drug interaction) on the on-target outcome, LDL cholesterol response.\n    3.  Together, these findings strongly support a model of horizontal pleiotropy.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The variant $G$ exhibits horizontal pleiotropy that confers off-target susceptibility to myopathy independent of statin exposure, while $G$ modulates on-target lipid response only under treatment.**\n-   \"horizontal pleiotropy\": Correct. As derived above, the effect of $G$ on myopathy in the placebo arm, where there is no effect on $\\Delta L$, demonstrates a pathway independent of lipid-lowering.\n-   \"confers off-target susceptibility to myopathy independent of statin exposure\": Correct. The significant association in the placebo arm ($\\hat{\\beta}_P = 0.20, p  0.001$) and the non-significant interaction term ($\\hat{\\psi}=0.02, p=0.76$) show that the myopathy risk from $G$ exists at baseline and is not significantly modified by statin treatment.\n-   \"G modulates on-target lipid response only under treatment\": Correct. The coefficient $\\hat{\\gamma}_P$ is non-significant ($p=0.73$), while $\\hat{\\gamma}_T$ is highly significant ($p  10^{-10}$).\nThis option accurately synthesizes all key findings.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The variant $G$ exhibits vertical pleiotropy mediated by lipid lowering, because the stronger per-allele effect on $\\Delta L$ in the statin arm implies that the increased myopathy risk is caused by greater LDL reduction.**\n-   This option claims vertical pleiotropy ($G \\rightarrow \\Delta L \\rightarrow Y$). This is contradicted by the data. If this mechanism were true, there should be no association between $G$ and myopathy ($Y$) in the placebo arm, since $G$ has no effect on $\\Delta L$ in that arm. However, the data show a strong association ($\\hat{\\beta}_P = 0.20, p  0.001$). Furthermore, if greater LDL reduction caused myopathy, we would expect a significant gene-drug interaction for myopathy ($\\psi  0$), which was not observed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The similar associations of $G$ with myopathy in both arms indicate residual population stratification; therefore the myopathy signal is confounded and unrelated to pleiotropy.**\n-   The analysis explicitly adjusted for the top $10$ ancestry principal components, which is the standard method for mitigating confounding by population stratification. While residual confounding is always a theoretical possibility, dismissing a strong, consistent biological signal as an artifact without stronger evidence is not sound scientific reasoning. The signal's presence in a randomized trial, combined with its specificity (affecting myopathy but not baseline LDL), makes confounding a less likely explanation than a true biological effect. The similarity of association is data, not an artifact; it argues against a gene-drug interaction for myopathy.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The data support a pure pharmacokinetic effect with no pleiotropy; the myopathy association arises from LD with variants influencing adherence behavior rather than biology.**\n-   A \"pure\" pharmacokinetic effect would mean the gene's influence is contingent on the presence of the drug. Such an effect should be absent in the placebo arm. However, the variant $G$ is strongly associated with myopathy in the placebo arm ($\\hat{\\beta}_P \\neq 0$). This single finding refutes the claim of a \"pure\" pharmacokinetic effect.\n-   The claim of \"no pleiotropy\" is false; the gene is associated with two different traits (myopathy and drug-response for LDL).\n-   The explanation involving adherence behavior is speculative and inconsistent with the finding of an association in the placebo arm. There is no reason a gene related to \"adherence\" would cause myopathy in patients receiving a placebo in a double-blind trial.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
