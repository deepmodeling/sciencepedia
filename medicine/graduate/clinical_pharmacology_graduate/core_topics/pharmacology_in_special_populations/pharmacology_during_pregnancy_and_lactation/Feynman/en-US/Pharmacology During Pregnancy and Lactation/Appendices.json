The Relative Infant Dose (RID) provides a standardized metric for quantifying infant exposure through milk, comparing the infant's dose to the mother's therapeutic dose.

For an orally administered maternal medication, assume steady-state conditions and that the drug concentration in milk is approximately constant over the day.

The concepts of drug dose, concentration, steady state, and Relative Infant Dose (RID) are standard in the evaluation of medication safety during lactation. The provided values are biometrically and pharmacologically plausible. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to calculate the RID as defined. The definition of RID is explicitly given, avoiding ambiguity (e.g., whether it is weight-adjusted or not). The presence of the infant's weight is extraneous for the calculation as defined, but this does not create a contradiction. The problem is objective and uses precise language. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to compute the Relative Infant Dose (RID) and provide a clinical interpretation based on a given threshold. The RID is defined as the ratio of the infant's total daily drug intake to the mother's total daily drug intake.\n\nLet $D_{\\text{infant, total}}$ represent the infant's total daily drug ingestion and $D_{\\text{mat}}$ represent the mother's total daily drug ingestion. The formula for RID is:\n$$\n\\text{RID} = \\frac{D_{\\text{infant, total}}}{D_{\\text{mat}}}\n$$\nThe maternal daily dose is given as $D_{\\text{mat}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mg}$. We must first calculate the infant's total daily dose, $D_{\\text{infant, total}}$.\n\nThe dose ingested by the infant in a single feed, $D_{\\text{infant, feed}}$, is the product of the drug concentration in the milk, $C_{\\text{milk}}$, and the volume of that feed, $V_{\\text{feed}}$.\n$$\nD_{\\text{infant, feed}} = C_{\\text{milk}} \\times V_{\\text{feed}}\n$$\nThe total daily dose for the infant, $D_{\\text{infant, total}}$, is the dose per feed multiplied by the number of feeds per day, $n_{\\text{feeds}}$.\n$$\nD_{\\text{infant, total}} = D_{\\text{infant, feed}} \\times n_{\\text{feeds}} = (C_{\\text{milk}} \\times V_{\\text{feed}}) \\times n_{\\text{feeds}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- $C_{\\text{milk}} = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- $V_{\\text{feed}} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mL}$\n- $n_{\\text{feeds}} = 8$\n\nBefore calculation, units must be consistent. The concentration is in milligrams per liter ($\\mathrm{mg/L}$), while the feed volume is in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$). We must convert the volume to liters.\nSince $1\\ \\mathrm{L} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, the volume per feed in liters is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{feed}} = 150\\ \\mathrm{mL} \\times \\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{L}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{mL}} = 0.150\\ \\mathrm{L}\n$$\nNow, we can calculate the infant's total daily dose:\n$$\nD_{\\text{infant, total}} = \\left(1.2\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{L}}\\right) \\times (0.150\\ \\mathrm{L}) \\times 8\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{infant, total}} = 1.44\\ \\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nThis is the total amount of the drug the infant ingests per day. The problem states to assume complete oral bioavailability, which means this entire ingested amount is considered the infant's effective dose.\n\nNext, we compute the RID using the infant's dose and the given maternal dose, $D_{\\text{mat}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.\n$$\n\\text{RID} = \\frac{D_{\\text{infant, total}}}{D_{\\text{mat}}} = \\frac{1.44\\ \\mathrm{mg}}{100\\ \\mathrm{mg}} = 0.0144\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.0144$ has three significant figures (the digits $1$, $4$, and $4$). To express this with four significant figures, we add a trailing zero: $0.01440$.\n\nFinally, we must interpret this result. The provided clinical guidance states that an RID less than $0.1$ (which corresponds to $10\\%$) is generally considered compatible with breastfeeding. Our calculated RID is $0.01440$.\nComparing the two values:\n$$\n0.01440  0.1\n$$\nThe calculated RID is substantially smaller than the threshold of concern. Therefore, based on this widely used clinical heuristic, the drug exposure to the infant appears to be acceptable. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the calculation was based on a worst-case scenario (complete oral bioavailability in the infant). The actual systemic exposure in the infant is likely even lower. The infant's weight, $W_{\\text{infant}} = 4\\ \\mathrm{kg}$, was not required for this specific calculation, as the problem defined RID based on total daily doses, not weight-adjusted doses.",

The derivation begins with the fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium and passive diffusion.\n\nA weak base, denoted by $B$, exists in equilibrium with its protonated (ionized) conjugate acid form, $BH^+$, according to the reaction:\n$$ BH^+ \\rightleftharpoons B + H^+ $$\nThe equilibrium is governed by the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, for the conjugate acid $BH^+$:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[B][H^+]}{[BH^+]} $$\nTaking the negative base-$10$ logarithm of this equation yields the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation:\n$$ \\text{p}K_a = \\text{pH} - \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right) $$\nwhere $[B]$ is the concentration of the un-ionized base, $[BH^+]$ is the concentration of the ionized conjugate acid, $\\text{pH} = -\\log_{10}([H^+])$, and $\\text{p}K_a = -\\log_{10}(K_a)$.

At steady state, the concentration of this diffusible species equilibrates, meaning its concentration becomes equal on both sides of the membrane.\n$$ [B]_m = [B]_f $$\nLet us denote this common equilibrium concentration as $[B]_{eq}$.\n\nWe can rearrange the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation to express the concentration of the ionized form, $[BH^+]$, as a function of the un-ionized form, $[B]$:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]}\\right) = \\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a $$\n$$ \\frac{[B]}{[BH^+]} = 10^{(\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a)} $$\n$$ [BH^+] = [B] \\cdot 10^{-(\\text{pH} - \\text{p}K_a)} = [B] \\cdot 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH})} $$\n\nNow, we apply this relationship to both the maternal and fetal compartments, using their respective $\\text{pH}$ values, $\\text{pH}_m = 7.4$ and $\\text{pH}_f = 7.3$, and substituting $[B]_{eq}$ for the un-ionized concentration.\nIn the maternal compartment:\n$$ [BH^+]_m = [B]_{eq} \\cdot 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_m)} $$\nIn the fetal compartment:\n$$ [BH^+]_f = [B]_{eq} \\cdot 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_f)} $$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions back into the equations for the total concentrations, $C_m$ and $C_f$:\n$$ C_m = [B]_{eq} + [B]_{eq} \\cdot 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_m)} = [B]_{eq} \\left(1 + 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_m)}\\right) $$\n$$ C_f = [B]_{eq} + [B]_{eq} \\cdot 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_f)} = [B]_{eq} \\left(1 + 10^{(\\text{p}K_a - \\text{pH}_f)}\\right) $$\n\nThe problem defines the fetal-to-maternal total blood concentration ratio as $D = \\frac{C_f}{C_m}$.
