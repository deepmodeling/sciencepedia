            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a $z$-score to test for inconsistency in a treatment network comprising three treatments: $A$, $B$, and $C$. The analysis is based on first principles of how log odds ratios and their variances combine.\n\nLet $d_{XY}$ denote the estimated log odds ratio for treatment $X$ versus treatment $Y$, and let $\\text{SE}_{XY}$ be its corresponding standard error.

The fundamental property of log odds ratios is their additivity across a treatment path. The logarithm of an odds ratio for $A$ versus $C$ can be expressed as the sum of the log odds ratio for $A$ versus $B$ and the log odds ratio for $B$ versus $C$.\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{OR}_{AC}) = \\ln(\\text{OR}_{AB}) + \\ln(\\text{OR}_{BC})\n$$\nApplying this principle to our estimated log odds ratios, the indirect estimate for $A$ versus $C$, denoted $d_{AC}^{\\text{ind}}$, is:\n$$\nd_{AC}^{\\text{ind}} = d_{AB} + d_{BC}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nd_{AC}^{\\text{ind}} = -0.20 + 0.30 = 0.10\n$$\nTo find the variance of this indirect estimate, we use the property of variance for a sum of independent random variables.

Therefore, the variance of the difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\omega) = \\text{Var}(d_{AC}^{\\text{dir}} - d_{AC}^{\\text{ind}}) = \\text{Var}(d_{AC}^{\\text{dir}}) + \\text{Var}(d_{AC}^{\\text{ind}})\n$$\nWe can express this in terms of the variances of the three initial direct estimates:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\omega) = \\text{Var}(d_{AC}^{\\text{dir}}) + \\text{Var}(d_{AB}) + \\text{Var}(d_{BC})\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(\\omega) = (0.11)^2 + (0.10)^2 + (0.12)^2 = 0.0121 + 0.0100 + 0.0144 = 0.0365\n$$\nThe standard error of the inconsistency is the square root of its variance:\n$$\n\\text{SE}(\\omega) = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}(\\omega)} = \\sqrt{0.0365}\n$$\nFinally, the $z$-score is calculated by standardizing the observed inconsistency $\\omega$. Under the null hypothesis of network consistency, the expected value of $\\omega$ is $0$. The $z$-score is therefore:\n$$\nz = \\frac{\\omega}{\\text{SE}(\\omega)} = \\frac{d_{AC}^{\\text{dir}} - (d_{AB} + d_{BC})}{\\sqrt{(\\text{SE}_{AC}^{\\text{dir}})^2 + (\\text{SE}_{AB})^2 + (\\text{SE}_{BC})^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$\nz = \\frac{-0.15}{\\sqrt{0.0365}} \\approx \\frac{-0.15}{0.1910497...} \\approx -0.78516...\n$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures, we get $z \\approx -0.785$.
