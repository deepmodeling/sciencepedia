This process results in empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) that are \"shrunk\" toward the population mean. Quantifying the degree of shrinkage is a critical diagnostic step, as high shrinkage suggests that an individual's data provides little information, making their parameter estimate less reliable for post-hoc analyses. This exercise  will guide you through the fundamental calculation of eta-shrinkage, helping you interpret the reliability of random effect estimates.",

The definition given is the \"proportional reduction in variance from the prior to the posterior\".

The problem states $ T = 0.30 $.\nThe excess, which we can denote as $E$, is the difference between the diagnostic value $S$ and the threshold $T$:\n$$ E = S - T $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ E = \\frac{2}{3} - 0.30 $$\nTo compute this, we can express both terms as fractions or decimals.\n$$ E = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{3}{10} $$\nUsing a common denominator of $30$:\n$$ E = \\frac{2 \\times 10}{3 \\times 10} - \\frac{3 \\times 3}{10 \\times 3} = \\frac{20}{30} - \\frac{9}{30} = \\frac{11}{30} $$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we convert the fraction $ \\frac{11}{30} $ to its decimal representation:\n$$ E = \\frac{11}{30} \\approx 0.366666... $$\nThe first four significant figures are $3$, $6$, $6$, and $6$. The fifth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ E \\approx 0.3667 $$\nThis is the excess of the computed diagnostic above the given threshold, rounded to four significant figures.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard application of variance decomposition principles within the context of pharmacometric modeling.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the expected absolute reduction in the inter-occasion variance of log-bioavailability when a binary covariate is added to the model. This reduction is the amount of variability that is explained by the covariate. The problem can be solved by applying the law of total variance.\n\nLet $Y_{i,k}$ be the occasion-level component of the log-bioavailability for individual $i$ on occasion $k$. In the base model, this entire component is described by a single random effect term, $\\kappa_{F,i,k}$, which is assumed to have a mean of $0$ and a variance $\\pi_0^2$. This variance, $\\pi_0^2$, represents the total inter-occasion variance before accounting for any covariates.\nFrom the problem statement, the standard deviation is $\\pi_0 = 0.30$, so the total inter-occasion variance in the base model is $\\pi_0^2 = (0.30)^2 = 0.09$.\n\nIn the covariate model, the occasion-level component $Y_{i,k}$ is modeled as a sum of a fixed effect due to the covariate and a residual random effect:\n$$\nY_{i,k} = \\beta \\cdot \\text{FED}_{i,k} + \\kappa'_{F,i,k}\n$$\nHere, $\\beta = \\ln(0.75)$ is the effect of the fed state, $\\text{FED}_{i,k}$ is the binary covariate ($1$ for fed, $0$ for fasted), and $\\kappa'_{F,i,k}$ is the residual inter-occasion random effect in the covariate model, with variance $\\text{Var}(\\kappa'_{F,i,k}) = \\pi_1^2$. The base model's random effect $\\kappa_{F,i,k}$ (with variance $\\pi_0^2$) can be seen as capturing the total variability of $Y_{i,k}$, after centering.\n\nThe law of total variance states that for two random variables $Y$ and $X$, the variance of $Y$ can be decomposed as:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(Y) = E[\\text{Var}(Y|X)] + \\text{Var}(E[Y|X])\n$$\nIn our context, $Y$ is the occasion-level component and $X$ is the covariate $\\text{FED}_{i,k}$.\n- $\\text{Var}(Y)$ is the total variance of the occasion-level component, which is the inter-occasion variance in the base model, $\\pi_0^2$.\n- $E[\\text{Var}(Y|X)]$ is the expected residual (unexplained) variance after accounting for the covariate $X$. This corresponds to the inter-occasion variance in the covariate model, $\\pi_1^2$.\n- $\\text{Var}(E[Y|X])$ is the variance explained by the covariate $X$.\n\nThe reduction in variance upon adding the covariate is the difference between the total variance and the residual variance, which equals the explained variance:\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Variance} = \\pi_0^2 - \\pi_1^2 = \\text{Var}(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}])\n$$\nWe need to compute $\\text{Var}(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}])$. First, we find the conditional expectation of $Y_{i,k}$ given the value of $\\text{FED}_{i,k}$. The random effect $\\kappa'_{F,i,k}$ is assumed to have a mean of $0$ and be independent of the covariate.\nFor the fed condition ($\\text{FED}_{i,k}=1$):\n$$\nE[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}=1] = E[\\beta \\cdot 1 + \\kappa'_{F,i,k}] = \\beta + E[\\kappa'_{F,i,k}] = \\beta\n$$\nFor the fasted condition ($\\text{FED}_{i,k}=0$):\n$$\nE[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}=0] = E[\\beta \\cdot 0 + \\kappa'_{F,i,k}] = 0 + E[\\kappa'_{F,i,k}] = 0\n$$\nSo, $E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}]$ is a new random variable that takes the value $\\beta$ with probability $p = P(\\text{FED}_{i,k}=1) = 0.60$ and the value $0$ with probability $1-p = 0.40$. This is a scaled Bernoulli random variable.\n\nThe variance of this random variable, $\\text{Var}(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}])$, is calculated as follows.\nFirst, its expectation:\n$$\nE[E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}]] = \\beta \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1-p) = \\beta p\n$$\nSecond, its variance:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}]) = E[(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}])^2] - (E[E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}]])^2\n$$\n$$\nE[(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}])^2] = \\beta^2 \\cdot p + 0^2 \\cdot (1-p) = \\beta^2 p\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the variance formula:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(E[Y_{i,k}|\\text{FED}_{i,k}]) = \\beta^2 p - (\\beta p)^2 = \\beta^2 p - \\beta^2 p^2 = \\beta^2 p(1-p)\n$$\nThis quantity is the absolute reduction in inter-occasion variance.\n\nNow we substitute the given values:\n- $\\beta = \\ln(0.75)$\n- $p = 0.60$\n\nReduction in Variance $= (\\ln(0.75))^2 \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot (1-0.60)$\n$$\n\\text{Reduction in Variance} = (\\ln(0.75))^2 \\cdot (0.60) \\cdot (0.40) = (\\ln(0.75))^2 \\cdot 0.24\n$$\nNumerically:\n$\\ln(0.75) \\approx -0.28768$\n$(\\ln(0.75))^2 \\approx 0.0827608$\nReduction in Variance $\\approx 0.0827608 \\times 0.24 \\approx 0.01986259$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the absolute reduction in variance is $0.01986$.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question, several metrics are appropriate for evaluating the inclusion of a covariate in a population PK/PD model:\n1.  **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT):** This test compares the objective function value (OFV), typically $-2 \\times \\text{log-likelihood}$, between the nested base and covariate models. A statistically significant drop in the OFV (e.g., a decrease of more than $3.84$ for one additional parameter at a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$) supports including the covariate.\n2.  **Information Criteria (AIC/BIC):** The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) can be used. These criteria balance model fit (OFV) with model parsimony (number of parameters). The model with the lower AIC or BIC value is preferred.\n3.  **Reduction in Unexplained Variability:** A clinically or statistically meaningful reduction in the variance of a random effect parameter (in this case, the inter-occasion variance $\\pi^2$) indicates that the covariate explains a substantial portion of the variability.\n4.  **Parameter Precision:** The inclusion of a covariate is supported if its effect size (here, $\\beta$) is estimated with adequate precision, typically assessed by a low relative standard error (RSE).\n5.  **Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) Plots:** Visual diagnostics, such as plots of residuals or empirical Bayes estimates of random effects versus the covariate, are used to assess if the covariate model has successfully accounted for trends that were present in the base model.",
