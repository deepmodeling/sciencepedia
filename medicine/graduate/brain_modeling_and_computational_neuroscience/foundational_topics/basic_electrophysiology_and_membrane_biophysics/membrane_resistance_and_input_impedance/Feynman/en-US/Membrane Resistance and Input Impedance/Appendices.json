            "solution": "The problem statement is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested quantities and compute their numerical values. The underlying model is a standard passive RC circuit, a fundamental representation of a neuronal membrane in computational neuroscience.\n\nThe neuronal membrane is modeled as a parallel circuit consisting of a capacitor with capacitance $C$, a leak conductance $G_{L}$, and an additional shunt conductance $g_{s}$. An external current, $I_{\\text{inj}}(t)$, is injected into this circuit, producing a membrane voltage $V_m(t)$. According to Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), the injected current must equal the sum of the currents flowing through each parallel branch:\n$$I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = I_C(t) + I_R(t)$$\nwhere $I_C(t)$ is the capacitive current and $I_R(t)$ is the total resistive (ionic) current.\n\nThe constitutive relations for the capacitor and the conductances are linear. The capacitive current is given by:\n$$I_C(t) = C \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt}$$\nThe resistive current is the sum of currents through the parallel conductances. The total conductance, $G_T$, is the sum of the leak conductance $G_{L}$ and the shunt conductance $g_{s}$:\n$$G_T = G_L + g_s$$\nThe total resistive current is then given by Ohm's law:\n$$I_R(t) = G_T V_m(t)$$\nSubstituting these relations into the KCL equation yields the governing linear ordinary differential equation for the membrane voltage:\n$$I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = C \\frac{dV_m(t)}{dt} + G_T V_m(t)$$\n\n1) Derivation of the input impedance $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega)$:\nTo find the input impedance, we analyze the circuit's response to a sinusoidal input current of angular frequency $\\omega$. We use complex phasor notation. Let the injected current be $I_{\\text{inj}}(t) = \\tilde{I} \\exp(j\\omega t)$ and the voltage response be $V_m(t) = \\tilde{V} \\exp(j\\omega t)$, where $\\tilde{I}$ and $\\tilde{V}$ are the complex amplitudes (phasors) and $j = \\sqrt{-1}$. The time derivative operator $\\frac{d}{dt}$ becomes multiplication by $j\\omega$ in the frequency domain. Substituting the phasor forms into the differential equation gives:\n$$\\tilde{I} \\exp(j\\omega t) = C (j\\omega \\tilde{V} \\exp(j\\omega t)) + G_T (\\tilde{V} \\exp(j\\omega t))$$\nDividing by $\\exp(j\\omega t)$, we obtain the algebraic relationship between the phasors:\n$$\\tilde{I} = (G_T + j\\omega C) \\tilde{V}$$\nThe input impedance $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega)$ is defined as the complex ratio of the voltage response to the injected current, $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{V}}{\\tilde{I}}$.

The angular cutoff frequency is $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$. The defining equation is:\n$$|Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega_c)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} |Z_{\\text{in}}(0)|$$\nFirst, we find the magnitude of $Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega)$:\n$$|Z_{\\text{in}}(\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{G_T + j\\omega C} \\right| = \\frac{|1|}{|G_T + j\\omega C|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{G_T^2 + (\\omega C)^2}}$$\nSubstituting this and the expression for $|Z_{\\text{in}}(0)| = \\frac{1}{G_T}$ into the defining equation for $f_c$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{G_T^2 + (\\omega_c C)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{G_T} \\right)$$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$\\sqrt{G_T^2 + (\\omega_c C)^2} = \\sqrt{2} G_T$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$G_T^2 + (\\omega_c C)^2 = 2 G_T^2$$\n$$(\\omega_c C)^2 = G_T^2$$\nTaking the positive root, as angular frequency is non-negative:\n$$\\omega_c C = G_T \\implies \\omega_c = \\frac{G_T}{C}$$\nSince $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$, we can solve for $f_c$:\n$$f_c = \\frac{\\omega_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{G_T}{2\\pi C}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the two scenarios.\nCapacitance is constant: $C = 150 \\text{ pF} = 150 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F}$.\n\nScenario 1: Before the shunt (\"before\" state)\nThe shunt conductance is $g_s = 0$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of circuit theory applied to a standard biophysical model of a neuron (the passive, isopotential membrane). It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe begin by formalizing the relationship between the specific membrane properties and the total properties of the neuron. A neuron modeled as an isopotential compartment can be conceptualized as a large number of infinitesimal membrane patches connected in parallel.\n\nLet $g_m$ be the specific membrane conductance, with units of siemens per square meter ($\\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{m}^2$). This is an intensive property of the membrane. The total membrane conductance, $G_M$, is an extensive property. For a neuron with total surface area $A$, we can find the total conductance by integrating the specific conductance over the entire area. Since all membrane patches are in parallel, their conductances add. Given that $g_m$ is uniform across the membrane, the total conductance is:\n$$G_M = \\int_A g_m \\, dA = g_m \\int_A dA = g_m A$$\nThis shows that the total membrane conductance $G_M$ scales linearly with the membrane area $A$.\n\nSimilarly, let $C_m$ be the specific membrane capacitance, with units of farads per square meter ($\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$). This is also an intensive property. The total membrane capacitance, $C_M$, is found by summing the capacitances of all parallel infinitesimal patches. Given that $C_m$ is uniform, the total capacitance is:\n$$C_M = \\int_A C_m \\, dA = C_m \\int_A dA = C_m A$$\nThus, the total membrane capacitance $C_M$ also scales linearly with the membrane area $A$.\n\nThe neuron's passive electrical behavior is described by a parallel RC circuit, where the resistance is the total membrane resistance $R_M$ and the capacitance is the total membrane capacitance $C_M$. The total membrane resistance $R_M$ is the reciprocal of the total membrane conductance $G_M$:\n$$R_M = \\frac{1}{G_M} = \\frac{1}{g_m A}$$\nFrom this relationship, we see that the total membrane resistance $R_M$ scales inversely with the membrane area $A$, i.e., $R_M \\propto A^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem defines the input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ as the zero-frequency limit of the input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega)$. For a parallel RC circuit, the complex impedance $Z(\\omega)$ is given by the formula for parallel components:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z(\\omega)} = \\frac{1}{R_M} + \\frac{1}{1/(j\\omega C_M)} = \\frac{1}{R_M} + j\\omega C_M$$\n$$Z(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_M} + j\\omega C_M}$$\nThe input impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega)$ for this single-compartment model is simply $Z(\\omega)$. Taking the limit as the frequency $\\omega$ approaches zero:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} Z_{\\mathrm{in}}(\\omega) = \\lim_{\\omega \\to 0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_M} + j\\omega C_M} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_M} + 0} = R_M$$\nTherefore, the input resistance is equal to the total membrane resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{in}} = R_M$. Consequently, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$ also scales inversely with the area:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{1}{g_m A} \\implies R_{\\mathrm{in}} \\propto A^{-1}$$\n\nNext, we consider the membrane time constant $\\tau$. For a parallel RC circuit, the time constant is the product of the resistance and the capacitance:\n$$\\tau = R_M C_M$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_M$ and $C_M$ in terms of the specific properties and area:\n$$\\tau = \\left(\\frac{1}{g_m A}\\right) (C_m A)$$\nThe area $A$ cancels out from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{C_m}{g_m}$$\nThis crucial result shows that the membrane time constant $\\tau$ is independent of the neuron's size (area $A$) and depends only on the intrinsic, specific properties of the membrane, $C_m$ and $g_m$. Thus, $\\tau$ does not scale with area, i.e., $\\tau \\propto A^0$.\n\nNow we can compute the required ratios for the two neurons. Let the properties of the first neuron be indexed by $1$ and the second by $2$. We are given $A_2 = 3A_1$. The specific properties $g_m$ and $C_m$ are the same for both neurons.\n\nFor the input resistances:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in},1} = \\frac{1}{g_m A_1}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{in},2} = \\frac{1}{g_m A_2}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},2}} = \\frac{1/(g_m A_1)}{1/(g_m A_2)} = \\frac{g_m A_2}{g_m A_1} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1}$$\nSubstituting the given relationship $A_2 = 3A_1$:\n$$\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{in},1}}{R_{\\mathrm{in},2}} = \\frac{3A_1}{A_1} = 3$$\n\nFor the time constants:\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{C_m}{g_m}$$\n$$\\tau_2 = \\frac{C_m}{g_m}$$\nSince the specific properties are identical for both neurons, their time constants are also identical:\n$$\\tau_1 = \\tau_2$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_1}{\\tau_2} = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair $\\left(R_{\\mathrm{in},1}/R_{\\mathrm{in},2},\\, \\tau_1/\\tau_2\\right)$.",

First, we separate the real and imaginary parts of $Y(\\omega)$:\n$$Y(\\omega) = g_L + j\\omega C + \\frac{g_h'(1-j\\omega \\tau_h)}{1+\\omega^2 \\tau_h^2} = \\left(g_L + \\frac{g_h'}{1+\\omega^2 \\tau_h^2}\\right) + j\\left(\\omega C - \\frac{\\omega \\tau_h g_h'}{1+\\omega^2 \\tau_h^2}\\right)$$\nSetting the imaginary part to zero for $\\omega = \\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} > 0$:\n$$\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} C - \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} \\tau_h g_h'}{1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_h^2} = 0$$\nDividing by $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}$ (since $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}} \\neq 0$):\n$$C = \\frac{\\tau_h g_h'}{1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_h^2}$$\n$$1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_h^2 = \\frac{g_h' \\tau_h}{C}$$\nA real, non-zero $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}$ exists if and only if $\\frac{g_h' \\tau_h}{C} - 1 > 0$, which is equivalent to $g_h' \\tau_h > C$. This condition is explicitly given in the problem statement.\n\nAt the resonance frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}$, the admittance $Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})$ is purely real:\n$$Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}) = \\mathrm{Re}[Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})] = g_L + \\frac{g_h'}{1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_h^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $1+\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}^2 \\tau_h^2$ from the resonance condition:\n$$Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}) = g_L + \\frac{g_h'}{g_h' \\tau_h / C} = g_L + \\frac{C}{\\tau_h}$$\nThe input impedance at resonance is $Z(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}) = 1/Y(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})$:\n$$Z(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}) = \\frac{1}{g_L + C/\\tau_h} = \\frac{\\tau_h}{g_L \\tau_h + C}$$\nSince $g_L$, $C$, and $\\tau_h$ are all positive physical quantities, $Z(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})$ is a positive real number.\nThe impedance magnitude at resonance is the absolute value of this quantity:\n$$|Z(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})| = \\frac{\\tau_h}{g_L \\tau_h + C}$$\nThe impedance phase at resonance is the argument of this positive real number, which is zero:\n$$\\phi(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}}) = \\arg(Z(\\omega_{\\mathrm{res}})) = 0~\\mathrm{rad}$$\nThe two requested quantities are the impedance magnitude and phase at resonance.",
