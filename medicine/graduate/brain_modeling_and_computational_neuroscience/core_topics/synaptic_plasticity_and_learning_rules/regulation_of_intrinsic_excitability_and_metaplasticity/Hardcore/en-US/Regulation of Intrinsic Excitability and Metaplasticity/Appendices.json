Report two dimensionless numbers, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley style model neuron, a staple of computational neuroscience. The use of a hyperpolarization-activated current ($I_h$) and the analysis of voltage sag are standard concepts. The linearization approach for small perturbations around a steady state is a valid and common analytical technique. The definitions of input resistance and sag amplitude are clear and physically meaningful. All terms are defined, and the parameters provided are in a realistic range for a neuron. The problem is self-contained, objective, and well-posed. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Expressions\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the steady-state input resistance, $R_{in}$. The input resistance is defined for small current injections, which implies we can linearize the system's current-voltage ($I-V$) relationship around the resting potential $V_0$. At steady state, a constant applied current $I_0$ results in a constant membrane potential $V_{ss}$, where $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$ and the gating variable $m$ has reached its steady-state value $m_{\\infty}(V_{ss})$. The governing equation is:\n$$I_0 = I_L + I_h = g_L(V_{ss} - E_L) + g_h m_{\\infty}(V_{ss})(V_{ss} - E_h)$$\nThe total steady-state current flowing out of the cell is $I_{ion}(V) = g_L(V - E_L) + g_h m_{\\infty}(V)(V - E_h)$. At rest ($t<0$), $I_{\\mathrm{app}}=0$ and $V=V_0$, so $I_{ion}(V_0) = 0$.\nFor a small applied current $I_0$, the resulting voltage $V_{ss}$ is close to $V_0$. We can use a Taylor expansion of $I_{ion}(V)$ around $V_0$:\n$$I_0 = I_{ion}(V_{ss}) \\approx I_{ion}(V_0) + \\left.\\frac{dI_{ion}}{dV}\\right|_{V=V_0} (V_{ss} - V_0)$$\nSince $I_{ion}(V_0) = 0$, we have $I_0 \\approx G_{ss}(V_{ss} - V_0)$, where $G_{ss}$ is the steady-state conductance.\nThe input resistance is $R_{in} = \\frac{V_{ss} - V_0}{I_0} = \\frac{1}{G_{ss}}$. We compute $G_{ss}$ by differentiating $I_{ion}(V)$:\n$$G_{ss} = \\left.\\frac{dI_{ion}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = \\left.\\frac{d}{dV}\\left[ g_L(V - E_L) + g_h m_{\\infty}(V)(V - E_h) \\right]\\right|_{V_0}$$\n$$G_{ss} = g_L + g_h \\left[ \\left.\\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0}(V_0 - E_h) + m_{\\infty}(V_0) \\cdot 1 \\right]$$\nUsing the provided notation $m_{\\infty}(V_0) = m_0$ and $\\left.\\frac{dm_{\\infty}}{dV}\\right|_{V_0} = s$, we get:\n$$G_{ss} = g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))$$\nThe steady-state input resistance is therefore:\n$$R_{in} = \\frac{1}{g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))}$$\n\nNext, we derive the normalized sag amplitude, $S_A$. This requires finding the initial peak voltage deflection, $\\Delta V_{peak}$, and the steady-state voltage deflection, $\\Delta V_{ss}$.\nThe steady-state deflection is $\\Delta V_{ss} = V_{ss} - V_0 = I_0 \\cdot R_{in} = I_0 / G_{ss}$.\nThe initial peak deflection, $\\Delta V_{peak}$, occurs at $t=0^+$, immediately after the current step is applied. At this instant, voltage can change, but the gating variable $m$ has not had time to react, so it remains at its pre-stimulus value, $m=m_0$. The effective conductance of the membrane at this instant is the \"instantaneous\" conductance, $G_{inst}$:\n$$G_{inst} = g_L + g_h m_0$$\nThe initial voltage deflection is given by Ohm's law with this instantaneous conductance:\n$$\\Delta V_{peak} = V(0^+) - V_0 = I_0 / G_{inst}$$\nThe sag amplitude $S_A$ is defined as $\\frac{|\\Delta V_{peak} - \\Delta V_{ss}|}{|\\Delta V_{peak}|}$. Since $I_0 < 0$, both deflections are negative. The sag phenomenon implies that the initial hyperpolarization is larger in magnitude than the steady-state one, i.e., $|\\Delta V_{peak}| > |\\Delta V_{ss}|$.\n$$S_A = \\frac{|\\Delta V_{peak}| - |\\Delta V_{ss}|}{|\\Delta V_{peak}|} = 1 - \\frac{|\\Delta V_{ss}|}{|\\Delta V_{peak}|}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the deflections:\n$$S_A = 1 - \\frac{|I_0 / G_{ss}|}{|I_0 / G_{inst}|} = 1 - \\frac{G_{inst}}{G_{ss}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the conductances:\n$$S_A = 1 - \\frac{g_L + g_h m_0}{g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))} = \\frac{g_L + g_h m_0 + g_h s(V_0 - E_h) - (g_L + g_h m_0)}{g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))}$$\n$$S_A = \\frac{g_h s(V_0 - E_h)}{g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculations\n\nWe now compute the baseline and new values for $R_{in}$ and $S_A$.\nThe driving term for the sag is $s(V_0 - E_h) = (-0.03\\,\\mathrm{mV}^{-1}) \\times ((-65\\,\\mathrm{mV}) - (-45\\,\\mathrm{mV})) = (-0.03) \\times (-20) = 0.6$. This is a dimensionless quantity.\n\n**Baseline calculation ($g_h = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS}$):**\nThe steady-state conductance is:\n$$G_{ss,base} = g_L + g_h(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))$$\n$$G_{ss,base} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times (0.2 + 0.6) = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times 0.8 = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 4\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 14\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\nSo, $R_{in,base} = \\frac{1}{14\\,\\mathrm{nS}}$.\nThe baseline sag amplitude is:\n$$S_{A,base} = \\frac{g_h s(V_0 - E_h)}{G_{ss,base}} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times 0.6}{14\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{3}{14}$$\n\n**New calculation ($g_h$ increased by $40\\%$):**\nThe new HCN conductance is $g_{h,new} = g_h \\times (1+0.40) = 5\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times 1.4 = 7\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\nThe new steady-state conductance is:\n$$G_{ss,new} = g_L + g_{h,new}(m_0 + s(V_0 - E_h))$$\n$$G_{ss,new} = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 7\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times (0.2 + 0.6) = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 7\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times 0.8 = 10\\,\\mathrm{nS} + 5.6\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 15.6\\,\\mathrm{nS}$$\nSo, $R_{in,new} = \\frac{1}{15.6\\,\\mathrm{nS}}$.\nThe new sag amplitude is:\n$$S_{A,new} = \\frac{g_{h,new} s(V_0 - E_h)}{G_{ss,new}} = \\frac{7\\,\\mathrm{nS} \\times 0.6}{15.6\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{4.2}{15.6} = \\frac{42}{156} = \\frac{7}{26}$$\n\n**Multiplicative Change Factors:**\n\n1.  **Input Resistance Change Factor:**\n    $$\\frac{R_{in,new}}{R_{in,base}} = \\frac{1/G_{ss,new}}{1/G_{ss,base}} = \\frac{G_{ss,base}}{G_{ss,new}} = \\frac{14\\,\\mathrm{nS}}{15.6\\,\\mathrm{nS}} = \\frac{14}{15.6} = \\frac{140}{156} = \\frac{35}{39}$$\n    Numerically, this is $\\frac{35}{39} \\approx 0.89743589...$.

This entire procedure is performed for the baseline M-current conductance, $g_M$, and for the suppressed conductance, $g_M' = \\max(0, g_M - \\Delta g_M)$. The final reported value is the gain shift, $\\Delta G = G(g_M') - G(g_M)$. A positive $\\Delta G$ signifies an increase in excitability.\n\n2.  **Burst Probability Increase ($\\Delta P$) Calculation:**\n    Bursting is a mode of firing characterized by clusters of high-frequency spikes separated by periods of quiescence. Here, a trial is classified as containing a burst if any interspike interval (ISI) is less than $100.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The probability of bursting, $P$, is estimated by running $N_{\\mathrm{trials}}$ independent simulations, each for $1000.0\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, at a fixed input current $I_{\\mathrm{app}} = 0.22\\,\\mathrm{nA}$. These simulations include an additive Gaussian white noise term, $I_{\\mathrm{noise}}(t)$, with a standard deviation of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{noise}}\\cdot\\sqrt{1/\\Delta t}$ to ensure the total variance of the injected current is independent of the time step. The probability $P$ is the fraction of trials that exhibit bursting. This estimation is done for both $g_M$ and $g_M'$, and the metric of interest is the increase in burst probability, $\\Delta P = P(g_M') - P(g_M)$. For reproducibility, a fixed random seed is used for the noise generation process.\n\nThe implementation will consist of a main simulation function that evolves the state variables according to the Euler update rules. This function will be called by two higher-level analysis functions, one for calculating $\\Delta G$ and another for calculating $\\Delta P$. The main script will iterate through the provided test cases, execute these analyses, and format the results as specified.",

            "problem": "A single-compartment neuron model is used to reason about a dissociation experiment in rodent cortical slices that aims to separate synaptic scaling from intrinsic plasticity using pharmacology and targeted stimulation. The membrane dynamics under current clamp are described by the conductance-based equation\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_{\\mathrm{L}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}) - \\sum_{x \\in \\{\\mathrm{Na},\\mathrm{K},\\mathrm{HCN},\\ldots\\}} g_x \\, \\phi_x(V) (V - E_x) + I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t) + I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t),\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is the leak conductance with reversal potential $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$, $g_x$ and $\\phi_x(V)$ describe voltage- and time-dependent activation of intrinsic conductances (for example sodium, potassium, and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels), $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)$ is the synaptic current, and $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$ is injected somatic current. Under whole-cell voltage clamp at a fixed holding potential $V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$, the measured synaptic current for a single excitatory event is\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} = g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} s(t) (V_{\\mathrm{hold}} - E_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}),\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ is the $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor conductance, $s(t)$ is the synaptic gating variable and $E_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ is its reversal potential. In this clamp configuration, changes in intrinsic conductances $g_x$ do not alter $I_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}}$ when $V$ is held fixed.\n\nSynaptic scaling is defined as a homeostatic multiplicative rescaling of excitatory synaptic weights that stabilizes postsynaptic firing rate, commonly observed after activity deprivation (for example with Tetrodotoxin (TTX)), and often requires tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\\alpha$) signaling and new protein synthesis. Intrinsic plasticity is defined as activity-dependent changes in intrinsic membrane conductances (for example mediated by L-type calcium channels) that alter input resistance, spike threshold, and the firing rate versus current curve. Metaplasticity refers to slow regulation of plasticity thresholds that gate subsequent synaptic or intrinsic changes.\n\nYou are to select the experimental design(s) that will dissociate synaptic scaling from intrinsic plasticity by selectively engaging one process while pharmacologically blocking the other, and by using targeted stimulation and measurement that isolates the engaged process. An effective dissociation must satisfy, in principle, all of the following: (i) a stimulation protocol that preferentially drives either synaptic or intrinsic mechanisms, (ii) a pharmacological blocker set that prevents the non-target process, and (iii) a measurement readout that is insensitive to the blocked process because of the measurement configuration (for example voltage clamp insensitivity to intrinsic conductances, or somatic current injection insensitivity to synaptic weights).\n\nConsider the following candidate designs. Choose all that would successfully dissociate the two processes.\n\nA. Induce synaptic scaling: Incubate slices for $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ in Tetrodotoxin (TTX) at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to silence spiking and trigger homeostatic scaling, while continuously applying the L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to suppress activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity. After washout of TTX and nimodipine, assess excitatory miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) under voltage clamp at $V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the firing rate versus current curve $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ under current clamp using somatic step currents. Prediction: multiplicative increase in mEPSC amplitudes by a factor $k > 1$ with unchanged rheobase and $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ slope relative to baseline.\n\nB. Induce intrinsic plasticity: In the absence of synaptic stimulation, deliver somatic depolarization pulses to layer $2/3$ pyramidal neurons ($300$ pulses, $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ duration at $0.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) to drive sustained postsynaptic spiking for $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$, while blocking synaptic scaling by applying a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\\alpha$) scavenger (etanercept at $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$) and a GluA2 C-tail peptide to prevent $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor insertion. Assess the firing rate versus current curve $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ under current clamp and mEPSC amplitudes under voltage clamp at $V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Prediction: decreased rheobase and increased $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ slope with unchanged mEPSC amplitude distribution.\n\nC. Attempt to dissociate by measuring during blockade of spiking: Apply TTX at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ acutely during recording to block sodium channels while delivering synaptic bursts via optogenetic input stimulation for $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$; measure $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ and mEPSCs during the TTX blockade.

            "solution": "The problem statement is critically validated before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Neuron Model Equation (Current Clamp):** $C \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_{\\mathrm{L}}(V - E_{\\mathrm{L}}) - \\sum_{x \\in \\{\\mathrm{Na},\\mathrm{K},\\mathrm{HCN},\\ldots\\}} g_x \\, \\phi_x(V) (V - E_x) + I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t) + I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$, where $C$ is capacitance, $g_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is leak conductance, $E_{\\mathrm{L}}$ is leak reversal, $g_x$ are intrinsic conductances, $\\phi_x(V)$ are their voltage/time dependencies, $E_x$ are their reversal potentials, $I_{\\mathrm{syn}}(t)$ is synaptic current, and $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$ is external current.\n- **Synaptic Current Measurement (Voltage Clamp):** $I_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} = g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}} s(t) (V_{\\mathrm{hold}} - E_{\\mathrm{AMPA}})$, where $g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ is AMPA receptor conductance, $s(t)$ is the gating variable, $V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$ is the holding potential, and $E_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$ is the AMPA reversal potential.\n- **Measurement Principle:** Under voltage clamp, changes in intrinsic conductances $g_x$ do not alter $I_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}}$.\n- **Synaptic Scaling Definition:** Homeostatic multiplicative rescaling of excitatory synaptic weights ($g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$). Triggered by activity deprivation (e.g., Tetrodotoxin (TTX)). Requires tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\\alpha$) and protein synthesis.\n- **Intrinsic Plasticity (IP) Definition:** Activity-dependent changes in intrinsic conductances ($g_x$). Alters input resistance, spike threshold, and the firing rate versus current ($r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$) curve. Often mediated by L-type calcium channels.\n- **Metaplasticity Definition:** Slow regulation of plasticity thresholds.\n- **Dissociation Criteria:** An effective dissociation must satisfy:\n    (i) a stimulation protocol that preferentially drives either synaptic or intrinsic mechanisms.\n    (ii) a pharmacological blocker set that prevents the non-target process.\n    (iii) a measurement readout that is insensitive to the blocked process due to the measurement configuration.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on standard, well-established models and concepts in computational and cellular neuroscience. The neuron model is a general conductance-based model. The definitions of synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity, the roles of the specified pharmacological agents (TTX, nimodipine, etanercept, etc.), and the electrophysiological measurement techniques (voltage clamp, current clamp) are all factually correct and part of mainstream neuroscience.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides clear, explicit criteria for what constitutes a successful dissociation experiment. The task is to evaluate a set of proposed experiments against these criteria. This structure allows for a unique and stable solution based on logical application of the provided principles.\n- **Objective:** The problem is framed in precise, technical language, free of subjective or ambiguous statements. The definitions and criteria are objective and formalizable.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides the necessary theoretical background (model equations), definitions (plasticity types), and experimental principles (measurement dissociation) to answer the question. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The proposed experimental designs, including stimulation protocols and pharmacological concentrations, are scientifically plausible and reflect real experiments conducted in the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and an excellent exercise in applying fundamental principles of experimental design in neuroscience. I will proceed to solve the problem by evaluating each option against the stated criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe core of the problem is to identify experimental designs that can successfully isolate synaptic scaling from intrinsic plasticity. According to the problem statement, a valid dissociation must satisfy three criteria: (i) selective stimulation, (ii) selective pharmacological blockade, and (iii) selective measurement.\n\nThe measurement principle is key:\n- Changes in synaptic strength ($g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$) are measured via mEPSC amplitudes under voltage clamp. At a fixed $V_{\\mathrm{hold}}$, $I_{\\mathrm{mEPSC}} \\propto g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$. This measurement is specifically stated to be insensitive to changes in voltage-gated intrinsic conductances $g_x$.\n- Changes in intrinsic excitability (due to changes in $g_x$) are measured by the firing rate versus injected current ($r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$) curve under current clamp. This curve's properties, such as rheobase (minimum current for firing) and slope, are determined by the set of intrinsic conductances $g_x$. This measurement is independent of synaptic input as it relies on somatic current injection $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n\nWe now evaluate each option against the three dissociation criteria.\n\n**A. Induce synaptic scaling: Incubate slices for $24\\,\\mathrm{h}$ in Tetrodotoxin (TTX) at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to silence spiking and trigger homeostatic scaling, while continuously applying the L-type calcium channel blocker nimodipine at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ to suppress activity-dependent intrinsic plasticity. After washout of TTX and nimodipine, assess excitatory miniature postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) under voltage clamp at $V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ and the firing rate versus current curve $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ under current clamp using somatic step currents. Prediction: multiplicative increase in mEPSC amplitudes by a factor $k > 1$ with unchanged rheobase and $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ slope relative to baseline.**\n\n- **(i) Selective Stimulation:** The protocol uses prolonged ($24\\,\\mathrm{h}$) activity deprivation with TTX. This is the canonical method for inducing homeostatic synaptic scaling. This criterion is satisfied.\n- **(ii) Selective Blockade:** The protocol includes nimodipine, a blocker of L-type calcium channels, which are stated to mediate IP. This pharmacologically blocks the induction of intrinsic plasticity. This criterion is satisfied.\n- **(iii) Selective Measurement:** The assessment uses voltage clamp for mEPSCs (sensitive to $g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$, insensitive to $g_x$) and current clamp with somatic injection for the $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ curve (sensitive to $g_x$, insensitive to $g_{\\mathrm{AMPA}}$). This measurement strategy correctly separates the two readouts. This criterion is satisfied.\nThe prediction aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: synaptic scaling occurs (increased mEPSC amplitude), while intrinsic plasticity is prevented (unchanged $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ curve). This design successfully dissociates the two processes.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Induce intrinsic plasticity: In the absence of synaptic stimulation, deliver somatic depolarization pulses to layer $2/3$ pyramidal neurons ($300$ pulses, $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ duration at $0.1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$) to drive sustained postsynaptic spiking for $30\\,\\mathrm{min}$, while blocking synaptic scaling by applying a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\\alpha$) scavenger (etanercept at $100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{mL}$) and a GluA2 C-tail peptide to prevent $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor insertion. Assess the firing rate versus current curve $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ under current clamp and mEPSC amplitudes under voltage clamp at $V_{\\mathrm{hold}} = -70\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Prediction: decreased rheobase and increased $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ slope with unchanged mEPSC amplitude distribution.**\n\n- **(i) Selective Stimulation:** The protocol uses direct somatic depolarization to drive postsynaptic spiking, a known driver of IP, without directly activating synapses. This preferentially engages intrinsic mechanisms. This criterion is satisfied.\n- **(ii) Selective Blockade:** The protocol includes a TNF$\\alpha$ scavenger and a peptide to block AMPA receptor trafficking, targeting the molecular machinery of synaptic scaling as defined in the problem. This pharmacologically blocks the induction of synaptic scaling. This criterion is satisfied.\n- **(iii) Selective Measurement:** The assessment uses the same valid measurement strategy as in option A, correctly separating the readouts for intrinsic and synaptic properties. This criterion is satisfied.\nThe prediction aligns perfectly with the expected outcome: intrinsic plasticity occurs (changed $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ curve), while synaptic scaling is prevented (unchanged mEPSC amplitudes). This design is the logical complement to A and also successfully dissociates the processes.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Attempt to dissociate by measuring during blockade of spiking: Apply TTX at $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ acutely during recording to block sodium channels while delivering synaptic bursts via optogenetic input stimulation for $10\\,\\mathrm{min}$; measure $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ and mEPSCs during the TTX blockade. Prediction: no spiking for $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ and reduced mEPSC detection due to suppressed network activity; conclude dissociation if either readout changes.**\n\n- **(i) Selective Stimulation:** The protocol delivers synaptic bursts, which would normally drive both synaptic and intrinsic activity.\n- **(ii) Selective Blockade:** TTX is applied, which blocks all sodium channel-dependent action potentials. This is not a selective blocker of *one form of plasticity*; it is a blocker of the neuronal activity (spiking) that often drives both. This fails criterion (ii).\n- **(iii) Selective Measurement:** Critically, measuring the $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ curve is impossible in the presence of TTX, as TTX prevents firing. An $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ curve where $r=0$ for all $I_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ provides no information about whether the underlying intrinsic conductances $g_x$ have changed. This measurement is invalidated by the pharmacology, failing criterion (iii).\nBecause a key measurement is rendered impossible, this design cannot dissociate the two processes.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Engage Hebbian plasticity while blocking $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors: Deliver spike-timing dependent pairing protocols ($60$ pairings at $\\Delta t = +10\\,\\mathrm{ms}$) to synaptic inputs while applying $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor antagonist CNQX at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist APV at $50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$; assess mEPSCs and $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ post-pairing. Prediction: blocked excitatory synaptic transmission during induction; any changes reflect intrinsic plasticity.**\n\n- This option introduces a different form of synaptic plasticity, Hebbian spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), which is distinct from the homeostatic synaptic scaling defined in the problem. The goal is to dissociate *synaptic scaling* from IP. This design targets the wrong synaptic process, thus failing to address the question. Furthermore, the application of CNQX and APV blocks the induction of most forms of Hebbian plasticity at these synapses. The protocol is designed to block the synaptic changes it purports to be studying, making the experimental logic convoluted. It does not fit the problem's framework of dissociating homeostatic scaling and IP.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Block both processes simultaneously: Apply nimodipine at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ and a GluA2 C-tail peptide while delivering synaptic bursts ($5$ trains of $100\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $1\\,\\mathrm{s}$ each) to excitatory inputs; measure mEPSCs and $r(I_{\\mathrm{ext}})$ afterward. Prediction: no change in either readout; conclude dissociation because neither changed.**\n\n- **(i) Selective Stimulation:** This protocol does not \"preferentially drive\" one process. It drives activity that could potentially induce both. More importantly, the explicit goal of a dissociation is to engage one process *while blocking the other*. This design seeks to block both.\n- This experiment is a negative control. A negative control is essential in science, but it is not a dissociation experiment as defined by the problem's criteria. Observing no change when both processes are blocked does not demonstrate that they can be separated. To demonstrate separation, one must show that Process A can be induced while Process B is not, and/or vice-versa. This design fails the fundamental logic of a dissociation experiment. The conclusion \"conclude dissociation because neither changed\" is fallacious.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only options A and B describe valid experimental designs that meet all stated criteria for dissociating synaptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity. They represent the two complementary experiments required for a full dissociation.",
