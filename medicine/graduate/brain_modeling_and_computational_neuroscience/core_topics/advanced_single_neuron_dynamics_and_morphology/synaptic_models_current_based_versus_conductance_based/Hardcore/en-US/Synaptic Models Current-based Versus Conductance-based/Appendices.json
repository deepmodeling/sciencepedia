Analysis of the Current-Based Synapse (Protocol 2)**\n\nThe membrane equation for the current-based input is:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} = -g_L (V - E_L) + I_{\\text{hold}} + I_s(t)$$\nSubstitute $V(t) = V_h + \\delta V(t)$ and use the steady-state condition $I_{\\text{hold}} = g_L (V_h - E_L)$:\n$$C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -g_L (V_h + \\delta V(t) - E_L) + g_L (V_h - E_L) + I_s(t)$$\nExpanding and simplifying the terms:\n$$C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -g_L(V_h - E_L) - g_L \\delta V(t) + g_L(V_h - E_L) + I_s(t)$$\n$$C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} = -g_L \\delta V(t) + I_s(t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the PSP, $\\delta V(t)$. The crucial observation is that the equation governing $\\delta V(t)$ depends only on the parameters $C$, $g_L$, and the input current $I_s(t)$. None of these depend on the holding potential $V_h$. Since the differential equation and the initial condition $\\delta V(0)=0$ are independent of $V_h$, the entire solution $\\delta V(t)$ must also be independent of $V_h$.\nConsequently, the peak amplitude of the PSP, $\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(curr)}}$, is the same regardless of the holding potential.\n$$\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(curr)}}(V_{h1}) = \\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(curr)}}(V_{h2})$$\nTherefore, the ratio $r_{\\text{curr}}$ is:\n$$r_{\\text{curr}} = \\frac{\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(curr)}}(V_{h1})}{\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(curr)}}(V_{h2})} = 1$$\n\n**2.

This implies $g_s(t) \\ll g_L$ for all $t$. The term $g_s(t) \\delta V(t)$ is a product of two small quantities and is thus a second-order term that can be neglected. This simplifies the equation to:\n$$C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} + g_L \\delta V(t) \\approx g_s(t) (E_s - V_h)$$\nLet's define an effective synaptic current $I_{\\text{eff}}(t) = g_s(t) (E_s - V_h)$. This term represents the current flowing through the synaptic channels, approximated by using the constant holding potential $V_h$ instead of the time-varying potential $V(t)$. The term $(E_s - V_h)$ is the synaptic driving force. The linearized equation becomes:\n$$C \\frac{d(\\delta V)}{dt} \\approx -g_L \\delta V(t) + I_{\\text{eff}}(t)$$\nThis equation has the same form as the current-based case, but with the input current $I_s(t)$ replaced by $I_{\\text{eff}}(t)$. The solution for $\\delta V(t)$ is linearly proportional to the magnitude of this effective current. Since $g_s(t)$ has a fixed time course, the entire time course of the PSP, $\\delta V(t; V_h)$, is proportional to the driving force $(E_s - V_h)$.\n$$\\delta V(t; V_h) \\propto (E_s - V_h)$$\nTherefore, the peak amplitude of the PSP is also proportional to the driving force:\n$$\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(cond)}}(V_h) \\propto (E_s - V_h)$$\nWe can now compute the ratio $r_{\\text{cond}}$ by taking the ratio of the peak amplitudes at the two holding potentials, $V_{h1}$ and $V_{h2}$:\n$$r_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(cond)}}(V_{h1})}{\\delta V_{\\text{peak}}^{\\text{(cond)}}(V_{h2})} = \\frac{k \\cdot (E_s - V_{h1})}{k \\cdot (E_s - V_{h2})} = \\frac{E_s - V_{h1}}{E_s - V_{h2}}$$\nwhere $k$ is the constant of proportionality.\nSubstituting the given values $E_s = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{h1} = -80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $V_{h2} = -60\\,\\mathrm{mV}$:\n$$r_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{0 - (-80)}{0 - (-60)} = \\frac{80}{60} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\n\n**3.

Here, $V_{0}$ is the baseline voltage at which the driving force is linearized. We can set $V_0=0$ without loss of generality, as it represents the resting potential around which the PSP develops. Substituting $I_{\\text{lin}}(t)$ yields:\n$$C_{m}\\,\\frac{dV_{lin}}{dt} = -g_{L}\\,V_{lin}(t) + g_{s}(t)(E_{s} - V_{0})$$\n\nWe are interested in the error in the voltage, defined as $\\epsilon(t) = V_{cond}(t) - V_{lin}(t)$.

The voltage excursion for the true, conductance-based response is bounded by $|V_{cond}(t) - V_{0}| \\le \\Delta V_{\\max}$.\nUsing these bounds, we can establish an upper bound for the magnitude of the error current:\n$$|I_{err}(t)| \\le g_{\\max} \\Delta V_{\\max}$$\nLet's denote this maximum error current as $I_{err, \\max} = g_{\\max} \\Delta V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe error voltage $\\epsilon(t)$ is the response of the passive RC circuit to the input current $I_{err}(t)$. The maximum voltage deviation for such a circuit occurs in response to a constant current input of maximum possible magnitude, sustained indefinitely. The steady-state voltage response $V_{ss}$ to a constant current $I_{in}$ is given by setting the derivative to zero: $g_L V_{ss} = I_{in}$, which yields $V_{ss} = I_{in}/g_L$.\nFor an arbitrary input current $I(t)$ bounded by $|I(t)| \\le I_{\\max}$, the resulting voltage $v(t)$ is bounded by $|v(t)| \\le I_{\\max}/g_L$. This can be shown formally using the convolution integral. The voltage is $\\epsilon(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} H(t-s)I_{err}(s)ds$, where $H(t) = \\frac{1}{C_m} \\exp(-\\frac{g_L}{C_m}t)$ is the impulse response.\n$$|\\epsilon(t)| \\le \\int_{0}^{t} H(t-s) |I_{err}(s)| ds \\le I_{err, \\max} \\int_{0}^{t} H(s') ds'$$\nwhere $s' = t-s$.
