A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Passive Cable Equation\n\nLet $V(x,t)$ be the membrane potential difference from the resting potential at position $x$ and time $t$. We consider a small cylindrical segment of the cable of length $\\Delta x$.\n\nThe axial current, $i_a(x,t)$, flows along the interior of the cable. The resistance to this axial flow is determined by the intracellular resistivity $R_i$ and the cross-sectional area of the cable, $A = \\pi a^2$. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is:\n$$r_i = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\nAccording to Ohm's law, the change in voltage along the segment is related to the axial current:\n$$V(x) - V(x+\\Delta x) = i_a(x) r_i \\Delta x$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$, we get a partial differential equation:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = i_a r_i$$\n\nCurrent can also flow out of the segment across the cell membrane. This transmembrane current per unit length, $i_m(x,t)$, causes a change in the axial current along the segment. By conservation of charge (Kirchhoff's current law), the change in axial current must be equal to the current leaving through the membrane:\n$$i_a(x) - i_a(x+\\Delta x) = i_m(x) \\Delta x$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta x \\to 0$:\n$$-\\frac{\\partial i_a}{\\partial x} = i_m$$\nDifferentiating the Ohm's law equation with respect to $x$ gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = -r_i \\frac{\\partial i_a}{\\partial x}$$\nSubstituting the conservation of charge equation into this, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = i_m$$\nThe transmembrane current $i_m$ has two components, flowing in parallel: a resistive (ionic) component, $i_{ion}$, and a capacitive component, $i_c$. The specific membrane resistance is $R_m$ and the specific membrane capacitance is $C_m$. The resistance and capacitance per unit length of the cable, $r_m$ and $c_m$ respectively, are given by:\n$$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2 \\pi a}$$\n$$c_m = C_m (2 \\pi a)$$\nThe resistive current per unit length is $i_{ion} = V/r_m$. The capacitive current per unit length is $i_c = c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$. The total transmembrane current per unit length is their sum:\n$$i_m = i_{ion} + i_c = \\frac{V}{r_m} + c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $i_m$ into our combined equation yields:\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{V}{r_m} + c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the passive cable equation:\n$$\\frac{r_m}{r_i}\\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = V + r_m c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\nWe define the local membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ and the length constant $\\lambda$ as:\n$$\\tau_m = r_m c_m = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{2 \\pi a}\\right) (C_m 2 \\pi a) = R_m C_m$$\n$$\\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_m}{r_i} = \\frac{R_m / (2 \\pi a)}{R_i / (\\pi a^2)} = \\frac{R_m \\pi a^2}{R_i 2 \\pi a} = \\frac{a R_m}{2 R_i}$$\nSo, the length constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{a R_m}{2 R_i}}$.\nUsing these definitions, the passive cable equation is written in its canonical form:\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} = V + \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}$$\n\n### Steady-State Solution and Attenuation\n\nFor a steady-state condition, the potential does not change with time, so $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = 0$. The cable equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation for the steady-state potential $V_{ss}(x)$:\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2 V_{ss}}{d x^2} - V_{ss} = 0$$\nThe general solution to this second-order homogeneous linear ODE is:\n$$V_{ss}(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions for a semi-infinite cable ($x \\in [0, \\infty)$):\n1.  At $x=0$, the voltage is held at a constant value $V_0$. So, $V_{ss}(0) = V_0$.\n2.  As $x \\to \\infty$, the voltage must remain physically bounded. The term $A \\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. To keep the solution bounded, we must have $A=0$.\n\nWith $A=0$, the solution becomes $V_{ss}(x) = B \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. Applying the first boundary condition:\n$$V_{ss}(0) = B \\exp(0) = B = V_0$$\nThus, the steady-state solution for a semi-infinite cable is:\n$$V_{ss}(x) = V_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis solution describes an exponential decay of the voltage with distance from the soma. The length constant $\\lambda$ represents the distance over which the steady-state voltage attenuates to $1/e \\approx 37\\%$ of its value at $x=0$.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we must convert all parameters to a consistent set of units. We will use centimeters (cm), seconds (s), Ohms ($\\Omega$), and Farads (F).\n- $a = 1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$\n- $R_{i} = 100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}$\n- $R_{m} = 20\\,\\text{k}\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2} = 2 \\times 10^4\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}$\n- $C_{m} = 1\\,\\mu\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2}$\n- $x = 500\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{cm}$\n- $V_0 = 10\\,\\text{mV}$\n\n1.  **Calculate the membrane time constant $\\tau_m$**:\n    $$\\tau_m = R_m C_m = (2 \\times 10^4\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\text{F}/\\text{cm}^{2}) = 2 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}$$\n    Converting to milliseconds:\n    $$\\tau_m = (2 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\text{s}) \\times (1000\\,\\text{ms}/\\text{s}) = 20\\,\\text{ms}$$\n    To four significant figures, this is $20.00\\,\\text{ms}$.\n\n2.  **Calculate the length constant $\\lambda$**:\n    $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{a R_m}{2 R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm})(2 \\times 10^4\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^{2})}{2(100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm})}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^3}{200\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}}} = \\sqrt{0.01\\,\\text{cm}^2} = 0.1\\,\\text{cm}$$\n    Converting to micrometers:\n    $$\\lambda = (0.1\\,\\text{cm}) \\times (10^4\\,\\mu\\text{m}/\\text{cm}) = 1000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$$\n    To four significant figures, this is $1000\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\n3.  **Calculate the attenuated steady-state amplitude at $x = 500\\,\\mu\\text{m}$**:\n    We use the steady-state solution $V_{ss}(x) = V_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$.

            "problem": "Consider a passive dendrite described by the linear one-dimensional cable equation with membrane time constant $\\tau_m$ and length constant $\\lambda$, attached to a soma at $x=0$. A synaptic current is injected at position $x=\\lambda$ along the dendrite, with time course $I_s(t) = I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau_s) H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\tau_s$ is the synaptic decay constant.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is structured into three parts as requested by the problem: first, a qualitative argument regarding the approximation and invariance; second, the derivation of the voltage response for an isopotential soma; and third, the numerical evaluation of the half-width.\n\nPart 1: The EPSP shape, approximation, and half-width invariance.\nThe voltage response $V(x, t)$ in a passive cable is governed by the cable equation:\n$$ \\tau_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\lambda^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial x^2} - V $$\nIn the context of linear response theory, it is advantageous to work in the frequency domain. Let $\\tilde{V}(x, \\omega)$ and $\\tilde{I}_s(\\omega)$ be the Fourier transforms of the voltage and synaptic current, respectively. The transfer impedance $Z_{ij}(\\omega)$ relates the voltage at location $i$ to a current injected at location $j$ via $\\tilde{V}_i(\\omega) = Z_{ij}(\\omega) \\tilde{I}_j(\\omega)$. For a current injected at $x_{inj}$ and voltage measured at $x_{obs}$, this is $\\tilde{V}(x_{obs}, \\omega) = Z_{x_{obs}, x_{inj}}(\\omega) \\tilde{I}_s(\\omega)$.\n\nHere, the voltage is measured at the soma ($x=0$) and the current is injected at $x=\\lambda$. For a semi-infinite cable, which is a common approximation for a long dendrite attached to a soma, the transfer impedance is given by:\n$$ Z_{0, \\lambda}(\\omega) = Z_{in}(\\omega) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda(\\omega)}\\right) $$\nwhere $Z_{in}(\\omega)$ is the input impedance at the soma, and $\\lambda(\\omega) = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}}$ is the frequency-dependent length constant. The transfer function from input at $x=\\lambda$ to output at $x=0$ is therefore proportional to:\n$$ H_{cable}(\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}} \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}\\right) $$\nThe term $\\exp(-\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m})$ is a strong low-pass filter. For low frequencies where the main power of the synaptic signal resides, i.e., $\\omega\\tau_m \\ll 1$, we can approximate the square root term: $\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{2}i\\omega\\tau_m$.\nSubstituting this into the exponential term:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}\\right) \\approx \\exp\\left(-1 - \\frac{1}{2}i\\omega\\tau_m\\right) = \\exp(-1) \\cdot \\exp(-i\\omega\\tau_m/2) $$\nThe term $\\exp(-1)$ is a constant attenuation factor. The term $\\exp(-i\\omega\\tau_m/2)$ represents a time delay, according to the Fourier shift theorem. The remaining part of the transfer function, $1/\\sqrt{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}$, is also a low-pass filter. An isopotential soma is a single compartment RC circuit, whose impedance is $Z_{soma}(\\omega) \\propto \\frac{1}{1+i\\omega\\tau_m}$, which is also a low-pass filter. The argument is that the filtering action of the dendritic cable on a distal synaptic input, when viewed at the soma, has a similar low-pass characteristic to the filtering action of the soma itself. The cable acts to smooth the input signal. For inputs at a significant electrotonic distance ($x \\ge \\lambda$), the resulting somatic EPSP shape becomes largely independent of the exact input location and converges to a canonical shape, which is primarily determined by the filtering properties of the path. The response of an isopotential soma provides a simple, tractable model for this canonical filtered shape. Therefore, the EPSP at the soma for an input at $x=\\lambda$ can be approximated as a scaled and time-delayed version of the EPSP generated by the same current injected directly into an isopotential soma.\n\nThe half-width of a signal is invariant under scaling and time-shifting. Let $V(t)$ be a voltage trace with its peak $V_{peak}$ occurring at $t_{peak}$. Its half-width $W = t_2 - t_1$ is the duration between the two times $t_1$ and $t_2$ where $V(t_1) = V(t_2) = V_{peak}/2$.\nConsider a scaled and time-shifted version $V'(t) = A \\cdot V(t - t_d)$, where $A$ is a scaling factor and $t_d$ is a time delay. The peak of $V'(t)$ is $A \\cdot V_{peak}$ and occurs at $t'_{peak} = t_{peak} + t_d$. The half-peak value is $(A \\cdot V_{peak})/2$. The times $t'_1, t'_2$ at which $V'(t)$ reaches this value are found by solving $A \\cdot V(t' - t_d) = (A \\cdot V_{peak})/2$, which simplifies to $V(t' - t_d) = V_{peak}/2$. This occurs when $t' - t_d = t_1$ and $t' - t_d = t_2$. Thus, $t'_1 = t_1 + t_d$ and $t'_2 = t_2 + t_d$. The new half-width is $W' = t'_2 - t'_1 = (t_2 + t_d) - (t_1 + t_d) = t_2 - t_1 = W$. The half-width is invariant. This justifies using the half-width of the isopotential soma response for the original problem.\n\nPart 2: Isopotential soma response.\nFor an isopotential soma (a single RC circuit with total membrane resistance $R_m$ and capacitance $C_m$, where $\\tau_m=R_m C_m$), the voltage $V(t)$ across the membrane in response to an injected current $I_s(t)$ is given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ C_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{V}{R_m} = I_s(t) $$\nMultiplying by $R_m$ and using $\\tau_m = R_m C_m$, we get:\n$$ \\tau_m \\frac{dV}{dt} + V(t) = R_m I_s(t) = R_m I_0 \\exp(-t/\\tau_s) \\quad \\text{for} \\quad t \\geq 0 $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous differential equation. The solution for $t \\geq 0$, with the initial condition $V(0) = 0$ and assuming $\\tau_m \\neq \\tau_s$, is the sum of a homogeneous and a particular solution. The solution is found to be:\n$$ V(t) = \\frac{R_m I_0 \\tau_s}{\\tau_m - \\tau_s} \\left( \\exp(-t/\\tau_m) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_s) \\right) $$\nThis function is a difference of two exponentials, sometimes called an alpha function.\n\nTo find the half-width, we first find the time to peak, $t_{peak}$, by setting the derivative to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{R_m I_0 \\tau_s}{\\tau_m - \\tau_s} \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\tau_m}\\exp(-t/\\tau_m) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s}\\exp(-t/\\tau_s) \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_s}\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_s) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_m}\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_m}{\\tau_s}\\right) = t_{peak}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_s} - \\frac{1}{\\tau_m}\\right) = t_{peak}\\frac{\\tau_m - \\tau_s}{\\tau_m \\tau_s} $$\n$$ t_{peak} = \\frac{\\tau_m \\tau_s}{\\tau_m - \\tau_s} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_m}{\\tau_s}\\right) $$\nThe peak voltage is $V_{peak} = V(t_{peak})$. The half-width is $W = t_2 - t_1$, where $t_1$ and $t_2$ are the two solutions to the nonlinear scalar equation:\n$$ V(t) = \\frac{1}{2}V_{peak} $$\n$$ \\exp(-t/\\tau_m) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m) - \\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_s) \\right) $$\nThis equation must be solved numerically for $t_1$ and $t_2$.\n\nPart 3: Numerical evaluation.\nWe are given $\\tau_m = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\tau_s = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\nFirst, calculate the time to peak:\n$$ t_{peak} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 2}{20 - 2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{2}\\right) = \\frac{40}{18} \\ln(10) = \\frac{20}{9} \\ln(10) \\approx 5.11686\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nLet us define a normalized voltage function $v(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau_m) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_s) = \\exp(-t/20) - \\exp(-t/2)$.\nThe peak value of this normalized function is:\n$$ v_{peak} = v(t_{peak}) = \\exp(-5.11686/20) - \\exp(-5.11686/2) \\approx 0.77426 - 0.07743 = 0.69683 $$\nNote that from the condition for $t_{peak}$, we have $\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_s) = (\\tau_s/\\tau_m) \\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m)$, so $v_{peak} = (1 - \\tau_s/\\tau_m)\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m) = (1-0.1)\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m) = 0.9\\exp(-t_{peak}/\\tau_m)$.\nThe half-peak value is $v_{peak}/2 \\approx 0.348415$.

            "problem": "A single isopotential soma is attached to a uniform, semi-infinite passive dendritic cable (a cylinder of radius $a$) with intracellular axial resistivity $R_i$ and specific membrane resistance $R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}}$. At a distance $x_0$ from the soma along the dendrite, a localized synaptic hotspot is activated whose reversal potential equals the resting potential, so that at steady state it contributes a purely ohmic shunt conductance $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$ to ground at $x=x_0$. The soma has membrane area $A_s$ and specific membrane resistance $R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}}$, so its leak conductance is $g_s = A_s / R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}}$. Assume linear, steady-state (direct current) passive behavior everywhere and ignore extracellular resistance.\n\nYou inject a small steady current at the soma and measure the resulting steady somatic voltage deflection. Starting from the steady-state one-dimensional cable equation and current conservation (including the localized conductance at $x_0$), and using only first principles of passive cable theory, derive the effective dendritic load seen by the soma and compute the global somatic input resistance $R_{\\mathrm{in,soma}}$ after the hotspot is activated.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- $R_i = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}} = 2.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$,\n- $R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}} = 2.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$,\n- $a = 0.80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$,\n- $A_s = 1.26\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$,\n- $x_0 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mm}$,\n- $g_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nS}$.\n\nYou may treat the dendrite as semi-infinite beyond $x_0$. Express your final numerical answer for $R_{\\mathrm{in,soma}}$ in $\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, and round your answer to three significant figures. The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in passive cable theory. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe total input resistance of the soma, $R_{\\mathrm{in,soma}}$, is determined by the parallel combination of the soma's own membrane conductance, $g_s$, and the input conductance of the attached dendritic structure, $G_{\\mathrm{in,dend}}$. At steady state, conductances in parallel add. Therefore, the total somatic input conductance, $G_{\\mathrm{in,soma}}$, is:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{in,soma}} = g_s + G_{\\mathrm{in,dend}} $$\nThe somatic input resistance is the reciprocal of this value: $R_{\\mathrm{in,soma}} = 1/G_{\\mathrm{in,soma}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the soma's leak conductance, $g_s$. It is given by the ratio of the soma's membrane area, $A_s$, to its specific membrane resistance, $R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}}$:\n$$ g_s = \\frac{A_s}{R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}}} $$\n\nNext, we must find the input conductance of the dendrite, $G_{\\mathrm{in,dend}}$, as seen from the soma at position $x=0$. The dendrite is modeled as a finite cable of length $x_0$ connected to a load at $x=x_0$. This load is the parallel combination of the synaptic conductance, $g_{\\mathrm{syn}}$, and the input conductance of the semi-infinite portion of the dendrite extending beyond $x_0$.\n\nTo analyze the cable, we must first determine its fundamental parameters. For a uniform cylindrical dendrite with radius $a$, intracellular axial resistivity $R_i$, and specific membrane resistance $R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}}$, we define:\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$:\n$$ r_i = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2} $$\nThe membrane resistance-length product, $r_m$:\n$$ r_m = \\frac{R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}}}{2\\pi a} $$\nFrom these, we derive two characteristic constants of the passive cable:\nThe space constant, $\\lambda$, which describes the characteristic length over which voltage decays:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}} / (2\\pi a)}{R_i / (\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}} a}{2 R_i}} $$\nThe characteristic conductance, $G_c$, which is the input conductance of a semi-infinite cable:\n$$ G_c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r_m r_i}} $$\n\nThe total load conductance, $G_L$, at position $x_0$ is the sum of the synaptic conductance and the input conductance of the semi-infinite cable starting at that point:\n$$ G_L = g_{\\mathrm{syn}} + G_c $$\n\nThe input conductance $G_{\\mathrm{in,dend}}$ of a finite cable of length $x_0$ with characteristic conductance $G_c$, terminated by a load $G_L$, is a standard result derived from the steady-state cable equation, $\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V = 0$, by applying boundary conditions. The formula is:\n$$ G_{\\mathrm{in,dend}} = G_c \\frac{G_L + G_c \\tanh(X_0)}{G_c + G_L \\tanh(X_0)} $$\nwhere $X_0 = x_0 / \\lambda$ is the dimensionless electrotonic length of the proximal dendritic segment.\n\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values into these equations.\nGiven parameters:\n$R_i = 1.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$\n$R_{m,\\mathrm{dend}} = 2.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$R_{m,\\mathrm{soma}} = 2.0\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$a = 0.80\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$A_s = 1.26\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n$x_0 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.40 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$g_{\\mathrm{syn}} = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{nS} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n\n$1$.
