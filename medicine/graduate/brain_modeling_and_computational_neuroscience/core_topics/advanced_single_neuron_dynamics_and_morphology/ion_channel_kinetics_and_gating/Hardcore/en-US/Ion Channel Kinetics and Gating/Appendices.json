There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be derived following the specified constraints.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of mean dwell times from the properties of sojourn times, and second, the derivation of the stationary probability from the master equation.\n\n**1. Mean Open Time and Mean Closed Time**\n\nThe problem states that the system is a continuous-time Markov chain and that dwell times are governed by the Markov property. A key consequence of the Markov property for a CTMC is that the sojourn time (or dwell time) in any given state $i$ follows an exponential distribution. The rate parameter of this exponential distribution is the total rate of exiting state $i$.\n\nLet $T_O$ be the random variable representing the dwell time in the Open state ($O$), and $T_C$ be the random variable representing the dwell time in the Closed state ($C$).\n\nFor the **Open state ($O$)**: The only possible transition is from $O$ to $C$, which occurs with a constant rate $k_{OC}$. Therefore, the total escape rate from state $O$ is $\\lambda_O = k_{OC}$. The dwell time $T_O$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $k_{OC}$.\nThe probability density function is $f_{T_O}(t) = k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe mean of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is $1/\\lambda$. Thus, the mean open time, $\\langle T_O \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\langle T_O \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{OC}}\n$$\n\nFor the **Closed state ($C$)**: The only possible transition is from $C$ to $O$, which occurs with a constant rate $k_{CO}$. The total escape rate from state $C$ is $\\lambda_C = k_{CO}$. The dwell time $T_C$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $k_{CO}$.\nThe probability density function is $f_{T_C}(t) = k_{CO} \\exp(-k_{CO} t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe mean closed time, $\\langle T_C \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\langle T_C \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{CO}}\n$$\n\n**2. Stationary Open Probability**\n\nThe stationary distribution is found by solving the Kolmogorov forward equations (also known as the master equation) under the steady-state condition. Let $\\pi_C$ and $\\pi_O$ be the stationary probabilities of the channel being in the Closed and Open states, respectively.\n\nThe master equation for this two-state system describes the rate of change of the probabilities $P_C(t)$ and $P_O(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_C(t)}{dt} = -k_{CO} P_C(t) + k_{OC} P_O(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP_O(t)}{dt} = k_{CO} P_C(t) - k_{OC} P_O(t)\n$$\nIn the stationary state (as $t \\to \\infty$), the probabilities are constant, so the time derivatives are zero. We replace $P_C(t)$ with $\\pi_C$ and $P_O(t)$ with $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n0 = -k_{CO} \\pi_C + k_{OC} \\pi_O \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{CO} \\pi_C = k_{OC} \\pi_O\n$$\nThis equation expresses the principle of detailed balance: at steady state, the probabilistic flux from state $C$ to $O$ equals the flux from $O$ to $C$.\n\nTo solve for the individual probabilities, we use the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must equal $1$:\n$$\n\\pi_C + \\pi_O = 1\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\pi_C$ and $\\pi_O$. From the detailed balance equation, we express $\\pi_C$ in terms of $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_C = \\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}} \\pi_O\n$$\nSubstituting this into the normalization equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}}\\right) \\pi_O + \\pi_O = 1\n$$\nFactoring out $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_O \\left(\\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}} + 1\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_O \\left(\\frac{k_{OC} + k_{CO}}{k_{CO}}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for the stationary open probability, $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_O = \\frac{k_{CO}}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given rate constants are $k_{CO} = 20\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{OC} = 80\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\n-   **Mean Open Time**:\n    $$\n    \\langle T_O \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{OC}} = \\frac{1}{80}\\,\\text{s} = 0.0125\\,\\text{s}\n    $$\n-   **Mean Closed Time**:\n    $$\n    \\langle T_C \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{CO}} = \\frac{1}{20}\\,\\text{s} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}\n    $$\n-   **Stationary Open Probability**:\n    $$\n    \\pi_O = \\frac{k_{CO}}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}} = \\frac{20}{20 + 80} = \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n    $$\n\nThe results are: a mean open time of $0.0125$ seconds, a mean closed time of $0.05$ seconds, and a stationary open probability of $0.2$.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the current-voltage relationship, $I(V)$, and the slope conductance, $\\frac{dI}{dV}$, evaluated at the reversal potential, $V=E$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Current-Voltage Relation $I(V)$**\n\nThe problem states that the macroscopic current, $I(V)$, follows an Ohmic form modulated by gating. This means the current is the product of three terms: the maximal conductance $\\bar{g}$ (the conductance if all channels were open), the probability that a channel is open $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, and the electrochemical driving force $(V-E)$.\n\nMathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$I(V) = \\bar{g} \\cdot P_{\\text{open}}(V) \\cdot (V-E)$$\nwhere $\\bar{g}$ is in siemens, and $V$ and $E$ are in volts, rendering $I(V)$ in amperes.\n\nWe are given the expression for the steady-state open probability:\n$$P_{\\text{open}}(V) = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{zF(V-V_{1/2})}{RT}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for the current gives the complete current-voltage relation:\n$$I(V) = \\bar{g} (V-E) \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{zF(V-V_{1/2})}{RT}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for $I(V)$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Slope Conductance at $V=E$**\n\nThe local slope conductance is the derivative of the current $I$ with respect to the voltage $V$, denoted as $\\frac{dI}{dV}$. To find this, we must differentiate the expression for $I(V)$ with respect to $V$. The expression is a product of two voltage-dependent functions: $\\bar{g}(V-E)$ and $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$. We apply the product rule for differentiation, $(fg)' = f'g + fg'$.\n\nLet $f(V) = \\bar{g}(V-E)$ and $g(V) = P_{\\text{open}}(V)$.\nThen $I(V) = f(V)g(V)$.\nThe derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = \\frac{d}{dV}f(V) \\cdot g(V) + f(V) \\cdot \\frac{d}{dV}g(V)$$\nFirst, we find the derivatives of $f(V)$ and $g(V)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dV}f(V) = \\frac{d}{dV}(\\bar{g}(V-E)) = \\bar{g}$$\n$$\\frac{d}{dV}g(V) = \\frac{d}{dV} P_{\\text{open}}(V)$$\nThe derivative of the Boltzmann function $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$ is non-trivial. Let the argument of the exponential be $x(V) = -\\frac{zF(V-V_{1/2})}{RT}$. Then $P_{\\text{open}}(V) = (1+\\exp(x(V)))^{-1}$.\nUsing the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{open}}}{dV} = -(1+\\exp(x(V)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(x(V)) \\cdot \\frac{dx}{dV}$$\nwhere $\\frac{dx}{dV} = -\\frac{zF}{RT}$.\nSubstituting back:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{open}}}{dV} = -(1+\\exp(x(V)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(x(V)) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{zF}{RT}\\right) = \\frac{zF}{RT} \\frac{\\exp(x(V))}{(1+\\exp(x(V)))^2}$$\nThis can be elegantly expressed in terms of $P_{\\text{open}}(V)$ and $(1-P_{\\text{open}}(V))$:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\text{open}}}{dV} = \\frac{zF}{RT} P_{\\text{open}}(V)(1-P_{\\text{open}}(V))$$\nNow, substituting these derivatives back into the product rule expression for $\\frac{dI}{dV}$:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dV} = \\bar{g} \\cdot P_{\\text{open}}(V) + \\bar{g}(V-E) \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{zF}{RT} P_{\\text{open}}(V)(1-P_{\\text{open}}(V)) \\right]$$\nThe problem asks for this slope conductance to be evaluated at the reversal potential, $V=E$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=E} = \\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(E) + \\bar{g}(E-E) \\left[ \\frac{zF}{RT} P_{\\text{open}}(E)(1-P_{\\text{open}}(E)) \\right]$$\nThe second term contains the factor $(E-E)$, which is equal to $0$. Therefore, the entire second term vanishes.\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=E} = \\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(E) + 0$$\nThus, the slope conductance at $V=E$ is:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=E} = \\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(E)$$\nSubstituting the full expression for $P_{\\text{open}}(E)$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=E} = \\bar{g} \\frac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{zF(E-V_{1/2})}{RT}\\right)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the slope conductance at $V=E$, and its unit is siemens.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe slope conductance at the reversal potential is $\\left. \\frac{dI}{dV} \\right|_{V=E} = \\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(E)$.\n\n-   **Sign:** The maximal conductance $\\bar{g}$ is a physical property and is non-negative ($\\bar{g} \\ge 0$). The open probability $P_{\\text{open}}(E)$ is, by definition, a value between $0$ and $1$. Therefore, their product, $\\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(E)$, must be non-negative. This means the slope of the $I$-$V$ curve at the reversal potential is positive (or zero if no channels are open or $\\bar{g}=0$). A positive slope at the point where current is zero indicates that the current is an increasing function of voltage, which is characteristic of outward rectification for $V>E$ if positive ions are the charge carriers.\n\n-   **Magnitude and Physical Meaning:** The general expression for slope conductance, $\\frac{dI}{dV} = \\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(V) + \\bar{g}(V-E) \\frac{dP_{\\text{open}}}{dV}$, has two components. The first term, $\\bar{g} P_{\\text{open}}(V)$, is the instantaneous conductance from the population of open channels. The second term, $\\bar{g}(V-E) \\frac{dP_{\\text{open}}}{dV}$, reflects the change in current due to voltage-dependent gating (i.e., the change in the number of open channels as voltage changes). At the reversal potential $V=E$, the driving force $(V-E)$ is zero. Consequently, the second term vanishes. This has a critical physical implication: at the reversal potential, any infinitesimal change in the number of open channels (gating) has no effect on the slope of the current, because there is no potential difference to drive a current through these newly opened or closed channels. The local conductance is therefore determined exclusively by the population of channels that are already open at $V=E$. The magnitude of the slope is a direct measure of this conductance, $\\bar{g}P_{\\text{open}}(E)$. It is precisely the instantaneous Ohmic conductance of the membrane at that specific voltage.",
