## Introduction
For decades, neurons were often simplified as point-like integrators, summing inputs until a threshold was reached. However, this view overlooks the neuron's most intricate and extensive component: the dendritic tree. Modern neuroscience reveals dendrites not as passive wires, but as sophisticated computational devices in their own right, where electrical signals are actively processed and transformed before they ever reach the cell body. Understanding the dialogue of signals within these branches is key to unlocking the secrets of neural computation.

This article addresses the fundamental question of how dendrites compute. It bridges the gap between the simplistic [integrate-and-fire model](@entry_id:1126545) and the biophysical reality by dissecting the two primary forms of dendritic electrical signaling: forward-propagating potentials generated by synapses and backpropagating action potentials broadcast from the soma. This exploration is structured to build your understanding from the ground up. In **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will delve into the core biophysics, from the passive spread of signals described by [cable theory](@entry_id:177609) to the regenerative, all-or-none dynamics of [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333) and backpropagating action potentials. Following this, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate how these mechanisms enable profound biological functions, such as synaptic learning rules, complex logical operations, and the modulation of neural coding, with connections to fields from clinical neurology to artificial intelligence. Finally, **Hands-On Practices** will allow you to apply these concepts through targeted problems, solidifying your grasp of the theoretical principles.

## Principles and Mechanisms

Dendritic arbors, the intricate branching structures that form the primary receptive surface of most neurons, are far more than passive conduits for synaptic signals. They are sophisticated computational devices where electrical signals are actively processed, integrated, and transformed. Understanding the principles that govern the propagation of voltage transients along these structures is fundamental to appreciating their role in neural computation. This chapter delineates the biophysical mechanisms underlying two principal classes of dendritic signals: forward-propagating potentials initiated by synaptic inputs, and backpropagating action potentials originating from the axon.

### A Taxonomy of Dendritic Potentials

The electrical life of a dendrite is characterized by a rich diversity of voltage events, which can be broadly classified based on their origin, direction of propagation, and underlying biophysical mechanisms.

First are the **synaptic potentials**, the primary currency of information transfer between neurons. These events are initiated at postsynaptic sites by the binding of neurotransmitters to [ligand-gated ion channels](@entry_id:152066), such as AMPA and NMDA receptors for [excitatory postsynaptic potentials](@entry_id:165648) (EPSPs) or GABA-A receptors for [inhibitory postsynaptic potentials](@entry_id:168460) (IPSPs). By their nature, synaptic potentials are localized and graded in amplitude. In the absence of other voltage-dependent processes, they spread passively along the dendritic cable, their amplitude decaying significantly with distance. Consequently, a single synaptic event in a distal dendrite may produce a voltage change of less than five millivolts by the time it reaches the soma .

Second are the **forward-propagating [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333)**. These are regenerative, all-or-none events initiated *within* the dendritic tree itself, typically when a sufficient convergence of synaptic inputs depolarizes a local patch of membrane past a critical threshold. These spikes propagate orthodromically, or in the forward direction, toward the soma. Unlike their axonal counterparts, [dendritic spikes](@entry_id:165333) are often mediated by a heterogeneous collection of voltage-gated channels, including not only sodium channels ($\text{Na}_{\text{v}}$) but also various types of [voltage-gated calcium channels](@entry_id:170411) ($\text{Ca}_{\text{v}}$) and NMDA receptors, whose magnesium block confers a strong voltage dependency. This diversity of channels gives rise to a corresponding diversity of spike waveforms, from brief, fast sodium spikes with amplitudes exceeding $40\,\text{mV}$ to broader, lower-amplitude "plateau potentials" of $20-40\,\text{mV}$ sustained by calcium and NMDA currents .

Third are the **backpropagating action potentials (bAPs)**. These are conventional action potentials that are initiated at the axon initial segment (AIS), the neuron's [spike initiation](@entry_id:1132152) zone, and then propagate not only down the axon but also retrogradely, or backward, into the soma and dendritic arbor. The bAP is a global broadcast of the neuron's output, providing a feedback signal to the dendrites about the cell's recent firing activity. Like the axonal action potential, the bAP is a regenerative event mediated primarily by the rapid influx of sodium ions through $\text{Na}_{\text{v}}$ channels, followed by repolarization via potassium channels. However, as it travels into the dendritic tree, its amplitude typically diminishes with distance, a phenomenon we will explore in detail.

### Passive Propagation and the Cable Equation

To understand active propagation, one must first master the principles of passive spread. In the subthreshold regime, where voltage-dependent channels are not significantly engaged, a dendritic branch behaves as a passive electrical cable. The propagation of voltage in such a cable is described by the **linear cable equation**:

$$ \tau_{m} \frac{\partial V(x,t)}{\partial t} = \lambda^{2} \frac{\partial^{2} V(x,t)}{\partial x^{2}} - V(x,t) $$

where $V(x,t)$ is the membrane potential at position $x$ and time $t$, $\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant, and $\lambda$ is the crucial **space constant**. The space constant defines the characteristic distance over which a steady-state voltage signal decays. Specifically, for a constant voltage applied at one point, the potential at a distance $x$ will have decayed to $V(x) = V_0 \exp(-x/\lambda)$. This parameter encapsulates the cable's physical properties.

A critical insight from [cable theory](@entry_id:177609) concerns the influence of dendritic geometry on [signal propagation](@entry_id:165148). The space constant $\lambda$ is defined as $\lambda = \sqrt{\mathcal{R}_M / \mathcal{R}_L}$, where $\mathcal{R}_M$ is the [membrane resistance](@entry_id:174729) of a unit length of cable and $\mathcal{R}_L$ is the axial resistance per unit length. These parameters, in turn, depend on the cable's diameter, $a$. The axial resistance $\mathcal{R}_L$ is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area ($\pi (a/2)^2$), so $\mathcal{R}_L \propto a^{-2}$. The [membrane resistance](@entry_id:174729) per unit length, $\mathcal{R}_M$, is inversely proportional to the circumference ($\pi a$), so $\mathcal{R}_M \propto a^{-1}$. Combining these dependencies, we find:

$$ \lambda \propto \sqrt{\frac{a^{-1}}{a^{-2}}} = \sqrt{a} $$

This simple but profound relationship states that the space constant is proportional to the square root of the dendritic diameter. This means that thicker dendrites allow electrical signals to propagate further before decaying. For instance, if a dendrite's diameter doubles from $1\,\mu\text{m}$ to $2\,\mu\text{m}$, its [space constant](@entry_id:193491) will increase by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, significantly enhancing its ability to transmit signals to the soma . This normalization of physical distance by the cable's intrinsic properties gives rise to the concept of **[electrotonic length](@entry_id:170183)**, $L = d/\lambda$, which represents the true "electrical distance" between two points .

Passive propagation is fundamentally a diffusive process, not a true wave-like propagation. The time it takes for a signal to spread is highly dependent on distance, with characteristic latency scaling approximately with the square of the distance ($t \propto x^2$). This contrasts sharply with the linear [time scaling](@entry_id:260603) ($t \propto x$) of actively propagating spikes. As a result, a passive synaptic potential might take on the order of $10\,\text{ms}$ to travel a distance that a bAP covers in just $1-2\,\text{ms}$ . Furthermore, the dendritic cable acts as a low-pass filter, meaning that faster components of a signal are attenuated more strongly than slower components. This filtering property has significant implications for how dendrites process temporally patterned synaptic input .

### The Genesis of a Spike: From Graded Potential to Regenerative Event

What distinguishes a regenerative spike from a subthreshold, [graded potential](@entry_id:156224)? The answer lies in the dynamic interplay between passive leak currents and active, voltage-gated currents. A depolarization is "subthreshold" as long as any deviation from rest generates a net [ionic current](@entry_id:175879) that acts to restore the resting potential. This occurs when the total effective membrane conductance, $g_{\text{eff}}$, is positive.

A spike is born at the moment this condition is violated. When a depolarization is large enough to recruit a sufficient density of inward-rectifying [voltage-gated channels](@entry_id:143901) (like $\text{Na}_{\text{v}}$ or $\text{Ca}_{\text{v}}$ channels), the membrane can enter a positive feedback loop. The depolarization opens more inward-current channels, which causes further depolarization. This explosive process, known as regeneration, is triggered when the slope of the voltage-dependent inward current becomes so steep that it overwhelms the stabilizing influence of the leak conductance. Formally, this occurs when the effective conductance becomes negative :

$$ g_{\text{eff}} = g_L + \frac{\partial I_{\text{ion}}}{\partial V}  0 $$

where $g_L$ is the leak conductance and $I_{\text{ion}}$ is the sum of active, voltage-gated [ionic currents](@entry_id:170309). Once this threshold is crossed, the voltage rises rapidly in an all-or-none fashion, generating a spike. The subsequent inactivation of these channels, along with the activation of outward potassium currents, terminates the spike and underlies the **refractory period**, during which it is difficult or impossible to initiate another spike.

The specific kinetics of the spike depend on the channels involved. Fast-activating and -inactivating $\text{Na}_{\text{v}}$ channels produce brief spikes with very rapid rates of rise ($dV_m/dt \gtrsim 100\,\text{mV/ms}$), whereas the slower kinetics of $\text{Ca}_{\text{v}}$ channels and NMDA receptors give rise to broader spikes or plateau potentials . The overall excitability of a dendritic compartment—its propensity to generate a spike—is therefore determined by the precise balance of these and other channels. Enhancing inward currents (e.g., by increasing $\text{Na}_{\text{v}}$ [channel density](@entry_id:1122260)) or reducing outward, shunting currents (e.g., by decreasing A-type $\text{K}^+$ [channel density](@entry_id:1122260)) will robustly increase excitability. This will both lower the threshold for initiating forward-propagating spikes and allow backpropagating action potentials to travel further into the dendritic tree with less attenuation . It is crucial to note that the Hodgkin-Huxley model that describes these active channels is highly nonlinear. While it can be linearized around the resting potential to analyze very small perturbations, this approximation breaks down for large signals like spikes. The regenerative currents fundamentally break the linear reciprocity seen in passive cables, explaining why the attenuation of a large bAP can be far less than the attenuation of a small, forward-propagating synaptic potential over the same [electrotonic distance](@entry_id:1124362)  .

### Propagation in Complex Geometries: The Challenge of Branch Points

Dendrites are not simple, uniform cables; they are complex branching trees. Each [branch point](@entry_id:169747) represents a potential obstacle to a propagating electrical signal. When a traveling wave, such as a bAP, arrives at a bifurcation, it encounters an **impedance mismatch**. The parent branch is a single transmission line, but it must now deliver current to the combined electrical load of the two daughter branches, which act in parallel.

This mismatch has two key consequences. First, a portion of the wave's energy is reflected back into the parent branch. Analogous to reflections in optical or acoustic systems, the **voltage reflection coefficient** $\Gamma$ quantifies this effect. In the low-frequency limit relevant for these potentials, it can be shown from cable theory that the characteristic [admittance](@entry_id:266052) (the inverse of impedance) of a dendritic branch scales with its diameter to the power of $3/2$, i.e., $Y_0 \propto d^{3/2}$. The reflection coefficient at a [branch point](@entry_id:169747) connecting a parent branch (p) to two daughter branches (1 and 2) is given by :

$$ \Gamma = \frac{Y_p - (Y_1 + Y_2)}{Y_p + (Y_1 + Y_2)} = \frac{d_p^{3/2} - (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})}{d_p^{3/2} + (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})} $$

This equation reveals that if the daughter branches are collectively "thinner" electrically than the parent (i.e., $d_p^{3/2} > d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}$), the [reflection coefficient](@entry_id:141473) is positive. If they are "thicker," it is negative. Perfect [impedance matching](@entry_id:151450), with no reflection, occurs when the geometry obeys **Rall's 3/2 power rule**: $d_p^{3/2} = d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}$.

The second, more drastic consequence of the impedance mismatch is outright **conduction failure**. The axial current supplied by the propagating wave in the parent branch may be insufficient to charge the larger membrane area of the daughter branches to their spike threshold. To analyze this, we use the concept of a **safety factor (SF)**, defined as the ratio of the available depolarizing current to the minimum current required to reach threshold. Propagation succeeds if $\text{SF} \ge 1$ and fails if $\text{SF}  1$.

If a bAP is propagating along the parent branch with a baseline safety factor of $\text{SF}_0$, the safety factor at the [branch point](@entry_id:169747), $\text{SF}_{\text{branch}}$, is modulated by the change in electrical load. This gives the criterion for failure :

$$ \text{SF}_{\text{branch}} = \text{SF}_0 \cdot \frac{d_p^{3/2}}{d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}}  1 $$

This powerful expression shows that failure depends on both the intrinsic robustness of the spike (quantified by $\text{SF}_0$) and the geometric properties of the branch. A spike with a low initial safety factor may fail at even a modest branching, whereas a spike with a high safety factor can successfully navigate a more significant load increase. This principle explains why bAPs often fail to fully invade the entire dendritic tree, especially at [branch points](@entry_id:166575) leading from thick primary dendrites to finer, higher-order branches. The amplitude of a bAP at any given location is thus a dynamic product of passive decay, active boosting by local channels, and impedance effects at [branch points](@entry_id:166575), creating a complex spatiotemporal map of the neuron's own output across its receptive surface .
