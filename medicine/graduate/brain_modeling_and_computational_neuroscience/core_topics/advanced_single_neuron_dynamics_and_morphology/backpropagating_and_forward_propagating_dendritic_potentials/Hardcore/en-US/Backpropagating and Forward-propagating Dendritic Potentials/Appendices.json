Explain the relation of $A(d)$ to the amplitude decay of a backpropagating action potential (bAP) and the role of active membrane properties.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The passive cable equation is a fundamental and well-established model in computational neuroscience, derived from the principles of electrical circuits. The definitions of the membrane time constant $\\tau$ and the electrotonic length constant $\\lambda$ are standard in the field. The application of this model to understand the attenuation of dendritic potentials, such as bAPs, is a classic and critical topic in neurophysiology.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a differential equation and sufficient simplifying assumptions (steady-state, no distributed current source) to make it solvable. It implicitly relies on a standard physical boundary condition for a semi-infinite cable (potential remains bounded at infinity), which allows for a unique, stable solution. The questions are precise and lead logically from derivation to application and conceptual explanation.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language. There are no subjective or factually incorrect premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe starting point is the general cable equation:\n$$c_m \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r_i} \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x^{2}} - \\frac{1}{r_m} V + i(x,t)$$\nWe apply the steady-state assumption, $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = 0$, and the condition that there is no distributed current injection away from the source, $i(x,t) = 0$. The equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) describing the spatial variation of the steady-state voltage, $V(x)$:\n$$0 = \\frac{1}{r_i} \\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}} - \\frac{1}{r_m} V$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}} = \\frac{r_i}{r_m} V$$\nWe use the given definition of the electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}}$. Squaring both sides yields $\\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_m}{r_i}$, and thus $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{r_i}{r_m}$. Substituting this into the ODE gives the standard steady-state cable equation:\n$$\\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} V$$\nor\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^{2} V}{d x^{2}} - V = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 k^2 - 1 = 0$, which has solutions $k = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The general solution for $V(x)$ is therefore:\n$$V(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTo find the specific solution, we must apply boundary conditions. The problem describes potentials propagating away from a source along a dendrite. This is best modeled as a semi-infinite cable, where the source is at $x=0$ and the dendrite extends towards $x \\to \\infty$. A physically realistic solution requires the voltage to remain finite as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $C_1 \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$ would grow without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. Therefore, we must set $C_1 = 0$. This leaves:\n$$V(x) = C_2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by the voltage at the origin, $x=0$. Let $V(0)$ be the voltage at the source. Then:\n$$V(0) = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2$$\nThus, the specific solution for the spatial dependence of the voltage along a semi-infinite passive cable is:\n$$V(x) = V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis expression shows that the steady-state voltage decays exponentially with distance from the source.\n\nNext, we derive the attenuation factor $A(d)$. By definition, $A(d) = \\frac{V(d)}{V(0)}$. Using our solution for $V(x)$, we can write $V(d)$ as:\n$$V(d) = V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $A(d)$:\n$$A(d) = \\frac{V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)}{V(0)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{d}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis is the general expression for the attenuation factor in a passive, semi-infinite cable.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $A(d)$ for the given parameters $\\lambda = 300\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ and $d = 600\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n$$A(600\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{600\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{300\\,\\mu\\text{m}}\\right) = \\exp(-2)$$\n\nFinally, we address the conceptual part of the problem.\nIn the passive limit, a backpropagating action potential (bAP) can be treated as a voltage transient propagating from the soma (the source at $x=0$) into the dendritic tree. The attenuation factor $A(d) = \\exp(-d/\\lambda)$ quantifies the decay of the peak voltage of this signal as a function of distance $d$ from the soma. For the given values, $A(600\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.135$. This means that in a purely passive dendrite, the amplitude of a bAP would decay to approximately $13.5\\%$ of its initial value after traveling a distance of $600\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, which is two electrotonic length constants. This severe attenuation is a direct consequence of the passive properties of the neuron: current leaks out across the membrane resistance ($r_m$) and dissipates along the axial resistance ($r_i$).\n\nHowever, real dendrites are not passive; they possess active membrane properties in the form of voltage-gated ion channels (e.g., Na$^+$, Ca$^{2+}$, and K$^+$ channels). When a bAP propagates, its depolarization can be sufficient to activate these channels.\n- Voltage-gated Na$^+$ and Ca$^{2+}$ channels open, providing an inward, depolarizing current. This current injection acts as a local amplifier, actively boosting the signal and counteracting the passive decay. This results in the bAP amplitude attenuating much less than predicted by the passive model.\n- Despite this active boosting, the fundamental passive attenuation is not eliminated. The passive properties of the cable (the continuous leakage of current across the membrane and dissipation along the axis) are always present and represent the \"load\" that the active currents must overcome. The density and kinetics of active channels may be insufficient to produce a fully regenerative, all-or-none action potential along the entire dendritic length, especially in thinner, distal branches. Therefore, active mechanisms modify and reduce the baseline passive attenuation, but they operate upon a physical structure that inherently dictates voltage decay with distance. The result is a modulated decay profile, but typically not a complete elimination of attenuation.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum steady synaptic conductance, $g_{\\text{syn}}$, required to depolarize a passive dendritic membrane from its resting potential, $E_L$, to a spike threshold, $V_{\\text{th}}$. The problem can be modeled by considering the current balance at the specified location on the dendrite, $x=400\\,\\mu\\text{m}$, under quasi-steady conditions.\n\nThe fundamental principle is Kirchhoff's Current Law, which states that the sum of currents flowing into a node must equal the sum of currents flowing out. At steady state, the membrane potential $V_m$ is constant, so the net current across the membrane is zero. The currents involved are the leak current, $I_L$, and the synaptic current, $I_{\\text{syn}}$.\n\nThe problem provides the local input resistance, $R_{\\text{in}}$, measured at rest.

Verdict:**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a full derivation.\n\n**2. Derivation**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by analyzing the dynamics of the inactivation variable $h(t)$ over a train of action potentials.\n\nThe recovery of $h(t)$ in the interval between two spikes is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty} - h}{\\tau_{h}}\n$$\nLet's consider the dynamics between the $n$-th spike and the $(n+1)$-th spike. Let the $n$-th spike occur at time $t_n$. Immediately after this spike, the inactivation variable is reset to $h_r$, so the initial condition for the recovery phase is $h(t_n) = h_r$. The solution to the ODE with this initial condition is:\n$$\nh(t) = h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_n}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)\n$$\nfor $t$ in the interspike interval $(t_n, t_{n+1})$.\n\nThe next spike, the $(n+1)$-th, occurs at time $t_{n+1} = t_n + T$, where $T = \\frac{1}{f}$ is the interspike interval. The value of the inactivation variable immediately before this spike, which we denote as $h_{\\text{pre-spike}}$, is found by evaluating $h(t)$ at $t = t_{n+1}$:\n$$\nh_{\\text{pre-spike}} = h(t_{n+1}) = h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{n+1} - t_n}{\\tau_{h}}\\right) = h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)\n$$\nA key feature of the model, as stated, is that the post-spike reset value $h_r$ is constant and independent of the pre-spike state. This means that the recovery process is identical in every interspike interval (after the first spike). Consequently, the pre-spike availability is the same for the second, third, and all subsequent spikes. The system reaches its dynamic steady state after just one interval.\n\nTherefore, the steady-state pre-spike availability, $h_{ss}$, is given by the expression derived above:\n$$\nh_{ss} = h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we can define the amplitudes. The bAP amplitude $A$ is proportional to the pre-spike availability, $A = c \\cdot h_{\\text{pre-spike}}$, for some constant $c > 0$.\n\nThe first bAP, $A_{\\mathrm{first}}$, occurs after a long period of quiescence. During this period, $h(t)$ has relaxed to its steady-state value in the absence of spikes, $h_{\\infty}$. Thus, the pre-spike availability for the first spike is $h_{\\infty}$.\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{first}} = c \\cdot h_{\\infty}\n$$\nThe steady-state bAP amplitude, $A_{\\mathrm{ss}}$, corresponds to the steady-state pre-spike availability, $h_{ss}$.\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{ss}} = c \\cdot h_{ss} = c \\left[ h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fractional amplitude reduction, $\\rho(f)$:\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{first}} - A_{\\mathrm{ss}}}{A_{\\mathrm{first}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the amplitudes:\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\frac{c h_{\\infty} - c \\left[ h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right) \\right]}{c h_{\\infty}}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant $c$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\frac{h_{\\infty} - \\left[ h_{\\infty} + (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right) \\right]}{h_{\\infty}}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\frac{h_{\\infty} - h_{\\infty} - (h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)}{h_{\\infty}} = \\frac{-(h_r - h_{\\infty}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)}{h_{\\infty}}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\frac{(h_{\\infty} - h_r) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)}{h_{\\infty}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{h_r}{h_{\\infty}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{h}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute $T = \\frac{1}{f}$ to express the result as a function of frequency $f$:\n$$\n\\rho(f) = \\left(1 - \\frac{h_r}{h_{\\infty}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{f \\tau_{h}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the fractional amplitude reduction as a function of $f$, $h_{\\infty}$, $h_r$, and $\\tau_h$.",
