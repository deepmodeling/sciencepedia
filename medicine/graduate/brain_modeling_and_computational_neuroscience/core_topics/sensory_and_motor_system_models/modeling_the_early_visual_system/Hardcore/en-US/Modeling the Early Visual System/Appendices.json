            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that requires the calculation of the diffraction-limited cutoff spatial frequency for the human eye, modeled as a circular aperture. The procedure must start from the Rayleigh criterion and a specific definition of cutoff frequency provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The eye is modeled as a diffraction-limited circular aperture of diameter $D$.\n- The illumination is monochromatic with wavelength $\\lambda$.\n- The angular location of the first zero of the point spread function is determined by the Rayleigh criterion.\n- The diffraction-limited cutoff angular spatial frequency, $f_{c,\\text{ang}}$, is defined as the reciprocal of the Rayleigh angle.\n- The final result must be in units of cycles per degree of visual angle.\n- Pupil diameter: $D = 3.5\\,\\text{mm}$.\n- Wavelength: $\\lambda = 550\\,\\text{nm}$.\n- The context is photopic conditions for the human eye.\n- The final numerical answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n- Intermediate angular quantities must be in radians.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on fundamental principles of optics, specifically Fraunhofer diffraction and the Rayleigh criterion for resolution. Modeling the eye's pupil as a circular aperture is a standard and valid first-order approximation in physiological optics. The given parameters, a pupil diameter of $D = 3.5\\,\\text{mm}$ and a wavelength of $\\lambda = 550\\,\\text{nm}$ (the approximate peak of the photopic luminosity function), are physiologically realistic for a human eye in bright light.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived as follows.\n\nThe Rayleigh criterion states that the first minimum of the diffraction pattern (the first zero of the Airy function) produced by a circular aperture of diameter $D$ occurs at an angle $\\theta_R$ given by:\n$$\n\\sin(\\theta_R) = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light. For optical systems like the eye, the angles involved are very small. Therefore, we can employ the small-angle approximation, $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta$, where $\\theta$ must be expressed in radians. This approximation is highly accurate for the small angles encountered in this context. The criterion thus becomes:\n$$\n\\theta_R \\approx 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nHere, $\\theta_R$ is the Rayleigh angle in radians.\n\nThe problem defines the cutoff angular spatial frequency, $f_{c,\\text{ang}}$, as the reciprocal of this Rayleigh angle:\n$$\nf_{c,\\text{ang}} = \\frac{1}{\\theta_R}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\theta_R$, we obtain:\n$$\nf_{c,\\text{ang}} = \\frac{1}{1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}} = \\frac{D}{1.22 \\lambda}\n$$\nFor this expression to be dimensionally consistent, $D$ and $\\lambda$ must be in the same units (e.g., meters). The resulting unit for $f_{c,\\text{ang}}$ is inverse radians (radians$^{-1}$). Since the period of a wave is the reciprocal of its frequency, this frequency can be interpreted as having units of cycles per radian.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be in cycles per degree. We must perform a unit conversion. Let the frequency in cycles per degree be denoted as $f_{cpd}$. The relationship between radians and degrees is:\n$$\n\\pi \\text{ radians} = 180 \\text{ degrees}\n$$\nTo convert a frequency from cycles per radian to cycles per degree, we multiply by the conversion factor $\\frac{\\pi \\text{ radians}}{180 \\text{ degrees}}$:\n$$\nf_{cpd} \\left[\\frac{\\text{cycles}}{\\text{degree}}\\right] = f_{c,\\text{ang}} \\left[\\frac{\\text{cycles}}{\\text{radian}}\\right] \\times \\frac{\\pi \\text{ radians}}{180 \\text{ degrees}}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $f_{c,\\text{ang}}$ gives the complete formula for the cutoff frequency in cycles per degree:\n$$\nf_{cpd} = \\frac{D}{1.22 \\lambda} \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $D = 3.5\\,\\text{mm} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\lambda = 550\\,\\text{nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m}$\n\n$$\nf_{cpd} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}}{1.22 \\times (550 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m})} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n$$\nThe units of meters (m) in the fraction cancel, leaving a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\nf_{cpd} = \\frac{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.22 \\times 550 \\times 10^{-9}} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n$$\n$$\nf_{cpd} = \\frac{3.5}{671} \\times 10^{6} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nf_{cpd} \\approx (0.00521609538...) \\times 10^{6} \\times (0.0174532925...)\n$$\n$$\nf_{cpd} \\approx 5216.09538... \\times 0.0174532925...\n$$\n$$\nf_{cpd} \\approx 91.03710...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf_{cpd} \\approx 91.04\n$$\nThe diffraction-limited cutoff spatial frequency for the given parameters is approximately $91.04$ cycles per degree.",

Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution proceeds by first constructing the reciprocal lattice, then identifying its first Brillouin zone, and finally determining the radius of the largest circle that can be inscribed within this zone.\n\n**1. Calculation of Reciprocal Lattice Vectors**\n\nThe real-space primitive lattice vectors are given as:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{1} = a\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{a}_{2} = a\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\mathbf{b}_1$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2$, are defined by the condition $\\mathbf{a}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{j} = 2\\pi \\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{b}_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_{j1} \\\\ b_{j2} \\end{pmatrix}$. We can solve the system of equations:\nFor $j=1$:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = a(1)b_{11} + a(0)b_{12} = ab_{11} = 2\\pi $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{1} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{11} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{12} = 0 $$\nFrom the first equation, $b_{11} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}$. Substituting into the second equation:\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right) + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{12} = \\pi + \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}b_{12} = 0 \\implies b_{12} = -\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor $j=2$:\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{1} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = a(1)b_{21} + a(0)b_{22} = ab_{21} = 0 \\implies b_{21} = 0 $$\n$$ \\mathbf{a}_{2} \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{2} = a\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)b_{21} + a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{22} = 2\\pi $$\nSubstituting $b_{21}=0$:\n$$ a\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)b_{22} = 2\\pi \\implies b_{22} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**2. The Reciprocal Lattice and First Brillouin Zone**\n\nThe reciprocal lattice is the set of all points $\\mathbf{G}$ given by integer linear combinations of the primitive reciprocal vectors: $\\mathbf{G} = n_1\\mathbf{b}_1 + n_2\\mathbf{b}_2$ for $n_1, n_2 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The first Brillouin zone is the Wigner-Seitz cell centered at the origin of this lattice. Its boundaries are formed by the perpendicular bisectors of the vectors from the origin to the nearest reciprocal lattice points. Therefore, we must find the shortest non-zero reciprocal lattice vectors.\n\nLet's compute the squared magnitudes of $\\mathbf{b}_1$, $\\mathbf{b}_2$, and their simple combinations:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(1^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} $$\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{b}_2\\|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(0^2 + \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} $$\nThe real-space lattice is triangular, so its reciprocal lattice is also triangular (hexagonal). A triangular lattice has $6$ nearest neighbors. Let's verify that other combinations like $\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2$ also have this minimum length.\nThe dot product is $\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\right)^2 \\left(1 \\cdot 0 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\right) = -\\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2}$.\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2\\|^2 = \\|\\mathbf{b}_1\\|^2 + \\|\\mathbf{b}_2\\|^2 + 2(\\mathbf{b}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_2) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} + \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} + 2\\left(-\\frac{8\\pi^2}{3a^2}\\right) = \\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2} $$\nThe vectors $\\pm \\mathbf{b}_1$, $\\pm \\mathbf{b}_2$, and $\\pm(\\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2)$ form a set of six vectors with the same squared magnitude $\\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2}$. These are the six nearest neighbors to the origin in the reciprocal lattice. The magnitude of these shortest reciprocal lattice vectors is:\n$$ G_{\\min} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\pi^2}{3a^2}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThe first Brillouin zone is the regular hexagon whose sides are the perpendicular bisectors of these six vectors.\n\n**3. Isotropic Alias-Free Cutoff Frequency**\n\nThe region of non-aliased frequencies is the first Brillouin zone. The problem requires the largest *isotropic* alias-free cutoff frequency, $f_c$. This corresponds to finding the largest circular region, centered at the origin, that fits entirely within the first Brillouin zone. For a regular hexagon, this is the inscribed circle.\n\nThe radius of the inscribed circle is the shortest distance from the center (origin) to the boundary. This distance is precisely half the magnitude of the shortest reciprocal lattice vectors:\n$$ F_c = \\frac{1}{2} G_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThis cutoff, $F_c$, is an angular frequency, with units of radians per unit length.\n\n**4. Conversion to Cycles per Unit Length**\n\nThe problem asks for the frequency $f_c(a)$ in cycles per unit length. The relationship between angular frequency $F$ (in radians/length) and spatial frequency $f$ (in cycles/length) is $F = 2\\pi f$.\nTherefore, we convert $F_c$ to $f_c(a)$:\n$$ f_c(a) = \\frac{F_c}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{a\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{a\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThis is the final expression for the isotropic Nyquist frequency for a hexagonal lattice with nearest-neighbor separation $a$. Any sinusoidal stimulus with a spatial frequency $\\|\\mathbf{f}\\|$ less than $f_c(a)=\\frac{1}{a\\sqrt{3}}$ is guaranteed not to cause aliasing.\nThis can also be written as:\n$$ f_c(a) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3a} $$\nHowever, the form $\\frac{1}{a\\sqrt{3}}$ is more direct.",
