It is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the ratio $A_{s}/A_{c}$ that satisfies the condition of zero direct-current (DC) gain. This condition is provided as $\\hat{K}(\\mathbf{0}) = 0$. We begin by evaluating the Fourier transform $\\hat{K}(\\mathbf{k})$ at the zero-frequency vector $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{0}$.\n\nUsing the given definition of the Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\hat{K}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{2}} K(\\mathbf{x}) \\exp(-i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}) d^{2}\\mathbf{x}\n$$\nSetting $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{0}$, the exponential term becomes $\\exp(-i\\mathbf{0}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}) = \\exp(0) = 1$.

Let $\\mathbf{x} = (x_{1}, x_{2})$, so $\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|^{2} = x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}$. The integral can be separated into a product of two identical one-dimensional Gaussian integrals:\n$$\nI(\\sigma) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{1}^{2} + x_{2}^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) dx_{1} dx_{2} = \\left[ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) du \\right]^{2}\n$$\nThe standard definite integral of a Gaussian is $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-a u^{2}) du = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. In our case, the constant $a = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^{2}}$. Thus, the one-dimensional integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) du = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{1/(2\\sigma^{2})}} = \\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^{2}} = \\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the two-dimensional integral $I(\\sigma)$:\n$$\nI(\\sigma) = (\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi})^{2} = 2\\pi\\sigma^{2}\n$$\nNow we apply this result to our equation relating the center and surround components. The integral for the center component is $I(\\sigma_{c}) = 2\\pi\\sigma_{c}^{2}$, and for the surround component, it is $I(\\sigma_{s}) = 2\\pi\\sigma_{s}^{2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\nA_{c} (2\\pi\\sigma_{c}^{2}) = A_{s} (2\\pi\\sigma_{s}^{2})\n$$\nThe common factor of $2\\pi$ cancels from both sides, yielding the relationship between the amplitudes and the variances:\n$$\nA_{c}\\sigma_{c}^{2} = A_{s}\\sigma_{s}^{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $A_{s}/A_{c}$. We can obtain this by rearranging the above equation:\n$$\n\\frac{A_{s}}{A_{c}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{c}^{2}}{\\sigma_{s}^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the required constraint on the amplitudes to ensure the kernel has zero DC gain.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational neuroscience.

A more elegant and efficient method is to utilize the Convolution Theorem, which states that convolution in the spatial domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain. Let $\\mathcal{F}\\{f(\\mathbf{r})\\}$ denote the two-dimensional Fourier transform of a function $f(\\mathbf{r})$, which maps the spatial domain function $f(\\mathbf{r})$ to its frequency domain representation $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})$, where $\\mathbf{k}$ is the spatial frequency vector.\n\nThe Convolution Theorem is formally expressed as:\n$$\\mathcal{F}\\{f(\\mathbf{r}) * g(\\mathbf{r})\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{f(\\mathbf{r})\\} \\cdot \\mathcal{F}\\{g(\\mathbf{r})\\} = \\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k})\\hat{g}(\\mathbf{k})$$\n\nApplying this theorem to our problem, we first take the Fourier transform of $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}\\{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{C(\\mathbf{r}) * G_{\\sigma_o}(\\mathbf{r})\\} = \\hat{C}(\\mathbf{k}) \\hat{G}_{\\sigma_o}(\\mathbf{k})$$\n\nNext, we find the Fourier transform of the intrinsic center component, $\\hat{C}(\\mathbf{k})$.

For the unit-mass Gaussian $G_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{r})$ defined above, its Fourier transform is:\n$$\\hat{G}_{\\sigma}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mathcal{F}\\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|^{2}}{2\\sigma^{2}}\\right) \\right\\} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nUsing this result, we can write the transforms for our two Gaussian components:\n$$\\hat{G}_{\\sigma_c}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{c}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\hat{G}_{\\sigma_o}(\\mathbf{k}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{o}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the equation for $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k})$:\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k}) = K_c \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{c}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right) \\right) \\left( \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{o}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\nBy the property of exponents, $\\exp(a)\\exp(b) = \\exp(a+b)$, we can combine the terms:\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k}) = K_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{c}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2} - \\frac{\\sigma_{o}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n$$\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k}) = K_c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\sigma_{c}^{2} + \\sigma_{o}^{2}) \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nThis expression for $\\hat{C}_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{k})$ is the frequency-domain representation of the effective center component. We can see that it is a scaled Gaussian function of the frequency vector $\\mathbf{k}$. To determine the spatial properties of $C_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$, we must perform the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nThe result is of the form $\\hat{f}(\\mathbf{k}) = K \\exp(-\\frac{\\sigma_{\\text{new}}^{2} \\|\\mathbf{k}\\|^{2}}{2})$, where $K = K_c$ and $\\sigma_{\\text{new}}^{2} = \\sigma_{c}^{2} + \\sigma_{o}^{2}$. The inverse Fourier transform of such a function is a scaled spatial Gaussian.

Thus, the resulting spatial function is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\mathbf{r}) = K_c G_{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}}(\\mathbf{r}) = K_c \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{r}\\|^{2}}{2\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2}}\\right)$$\n\nThe standard deviation of this effective Gaussian kernel is $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. From our identification above, we have:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{2} = \\sigma_{c}^{2} + \\sigma_{o}^{2}$$\nTaking the square root to solve for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (and noting that standard deviation is a non-negative quantity), we obtain the final expression:\n$$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{c}^{2} + \\sigma_{o}^{2}}$$\nThis result shows that the variances of the convolved Gaussians add, a fundamental property of this operation.",
