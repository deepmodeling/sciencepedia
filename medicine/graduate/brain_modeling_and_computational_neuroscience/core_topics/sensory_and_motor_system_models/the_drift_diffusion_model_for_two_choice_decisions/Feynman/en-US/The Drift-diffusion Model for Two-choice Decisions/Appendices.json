In contrast, the Laplace transform of the reaction time, $L_{T\\mid +}(\\lambda)$, is the product of the transform for the decision time, $L_{\\tau\\mid +}(\\lambda)$, and the term $\\exp(-\\lambda T_{\\text{er}})$. In the time domain, multiplication by $\\exp(-\\lambda T_{\\text{er}})$ corresponds to a convolution with a delta function at $T_{\\text{er}}$, which is a pure time shift. Thus, $T_{\\text{er}}$ shifts the reaction time distribution without altering its shape or affecting choice probabilities.\n\nFor a set of $N$ independent trials $\\{(C_i, T_i)\\}_{i=1}^N$, the likelihood of a single observation $(C_i, T_i)$ is given by the joint density $f(T_i, C_i; \\Theta)$, where $\\Theta = \\{v, a, z, \\sigma, T_{\\text{er}}\\}$. This can be written as $f(T_i \\mid C_i; \\Theta) \\mathbb{P}(C_i; \\Theta)$.\nLet $\\delta_i=1$ for an upper choice ($C_i=+$) and $\\delta_i=0$ for a lower choice ($C_i=-$). The likelihood for trial $i$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_i = [f_{T\\mid+}(T_i) p_{+}]^{\\delta_i} [f_{T\\mid-}(T_i) p_{-}]^{1-\\delta_i}\n$$\nwhere $p_- = 1 - p_+$ and $f_{T\\mid\\pm}(t) = f_{\\tau\\mid\\pm}(t-T_{\\text{er}})$, the conditional PDFs. The total log-likelihood is the sum over trials. This formulation shows that $T_{\\text{er}}$ enters the likelihood only as a shift parameter for the time data, separate from the parameters $\\{v,a,z,\\sigma\\}$ that govern the choice probabilities and the shape of the decision time distribution, thus justifying the decomposition.",
