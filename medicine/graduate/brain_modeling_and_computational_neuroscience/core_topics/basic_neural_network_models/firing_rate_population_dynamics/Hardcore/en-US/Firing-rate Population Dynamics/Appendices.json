A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to find the fixed points, denoted by $r^*$, of the system. A fixed point is a state where the system does not change over time, meaning $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$. Substituting this condition into the given ODE:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{dr}{dt} = 0 \\implies -r^* + \\phi(w r^* + I) = 0\n$$\nThis yields the fixed-point equation:\n$$\nr^* = \\phi(w r^* + I)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the ReLU function, $\\phi(x) = \\max\\{0, x\\}$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nr^* = \\max\\{0, w r^* + I\\}\n$$\nWe must analyze this equation by considering two cases based on the argument of the $\\max$ function.\n\n**Case 1: The trivial fixed point ($r^*=0$)**\nIf the net input $w r^* + I$ is less than or equal to $0$, then $\\max\\{0, w r^* + I\\} = 0$. The fixed point equation becomes $r^* = 0$. This solution is self-consistent if the condition $w r^* + I \\le 0$ holds. Substituting $r^* = 0$ into this condition gives:\n$$\nw(0) + I \\le 0 \\implies I \\le 0\n$$\nSo, a fixed point $r^* = 0$ exists if and only if the external drive $I$ is non-positive.\n\n**Case 2: The active fixed point ($r^* > 0$)**\nIf the net input $w r^* + I$ is greater than $0$, then $\\max\\{0, w r^* + I\\} = w r^* + I$. The fixed point equation becomes:\n$$\nr^* = w r^* + I\n$$\nWe can solve for $r^*$:\n$$\nr^* - w r^* = I\n$$\n$$\nr^*(1 - w) = I\n$$\n$$\nr^* = \\frac{I}{1 - w}\n$$\nThis solution is self-consistent if the condition $w r^* + I > 0$ holds. Substituting the expression for $r^*$ back into the condition:\n$$\nw \\left(\\frac{I}{1 - w}\\right) + I > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{wI + I(1 - w)}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{wI + I - wI}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{I}{1 - w} > 0\n$$\nThis condition is equivalent to $r^* > 0$. So, an active fixed point $r^* = \\frac{I}{1-w}$ exists if $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$. This occurs when $I$ and $1-w$ have the same sign. Typically in stable excitatory networks, we have $w  1$, which means $1-w > 0$. In this scenario, the condition for the active fixed point simplifies to $I > 0$.\n\nNext, we determine the local linear stability of a fixed point $r^*$. We linearize the ODE around $r^*$. Let $F(r) = -r + \\phi(w r + I)$. The ODE is $\\tau \\frac{dr}{dt} = F(r)$.\nLet $r(t) = r^* + \\delta r(t)$, where $\\delta r(t)$ is a small perturbation.\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(r^* + \\delta r)}{dt} = F(r^* + \\delta r)\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} \\approx F(r^*) + F'(r^*) \\delta r\n$$\nSince $F(r^*) = 0$ at a fixed point, the linearized equation for the perturbation is:\n$$\n\\tau \\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} = F'(r^*) \\delta r\n$$\nThe derivative $F'(r)$ is:\n$$\nF'(r) = \\frac{d}{dr}[-r + \\phi(w r + I)] = -1 + w \\phi'(w r + I)\n$$\nThe derivative of the ReLU function, $\\phi'(x)$, is $1$ for $x > 0$ and $0$ for $x  0$. It is undefined at $x=0$, which corresponds to a bifurcation point.\nThe linearized dynamics are governed by the equation $\\frac{d(\\delta r)}{dt} = \\lambda \\delta r$, where the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{F'(r^*)}{\\tau} = \\frac{-1 + w \\phi'(w r^* + I)}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe fixed point $r^*$ is stable if $\\lambda  0$ (perturbations decay) and unstable if $\\lambda > 0$ (perturbations grow).\n\nNow we apply this stability criterion to the two cases for the fixed point.\n-   For the trivial fixed point $r^*=0$ (which exists for $I  0$): The argument of the nonlinearity is $w(0) + I = I  0$. Thus, $\\phi'(I) = 0$. The eigenvalue is:\n    $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{-1 + w(0)}{\\tau} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    Since $\\tau > 0$, $\\lambda$ is always negative. Therefore, the trivial fixed point is always stable when it exists (for $I0$).\n-   For the active fixed point $r^* = \\frac{I}{1-w}$ (which exists for $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$): The argument of the nonlinearity is $w r^* + I = \\frac{I}{1-w}$, which is positive. Thus, $\\phi'(\\frac{I}{1-w}) = 1$. The eigenvalue is:\n    $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{-1 + w(1)}{\\tau} = \\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}\n    $$\n    For this fixed point to be stable, we require $\\lambda0$, which means $\\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}  0$. Since $\\tau>0$, this simplifies to the stability criterion $w  1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the specific values for $r^*$ and $\\lambda$ using the given parameters: $\\tau = 10\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $w = 0.8$, and $I = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\nFirst, we determine which fixed point is relevant.\n-   The parameter $w = 0.8$ is less than $1$.\n-   The parameter $I = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ is greater than $0$.\nAccording to our analysis, since $I>0$, the trivial fixed point $r^*=0$ does not exist. Since $I>0$ and $w1$, the condition $\\frac{I}{1-w} > 0$ is satisfied, so the active fixed point exists.\n\nWe compute the value of the active fixed point $r^*$:\n$$\nr^* = \\frac{I}{1 - w} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{1 - 0.8} = \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}{0.2} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nNext, we compute the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda$. For the active fixed point with $w1$, the system is stable. The eigenvalue is given by:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{w - 1}{\\tau}\n$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{0.8 - 1}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{-0.2}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{s}} = -20\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe sign of $\\lambda$ is negative, which means that small perturbations around the fixed point $r^*=2.5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$ will decay exponentially. The fixed point is stable.\n\nThe final answer is the row vector $(r^*, \\lambda)$, with $r^*$ in Hz and $\\lambda$ in $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$r^* = 2.5$\n$\\lambda = -20$",

The integrating factor is\n$$\n\\mu(t) = \\exp\\!\\left(\\int \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\, dt\\right) = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right).\n$$\nMultiplying both sides by $\\mu(t)$ gives\n$$\n\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\frac{d r(t)}{d t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) r(t) = \\frac{g \\alpha}{\\tau}\\, t \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right),\n$$\nor equivalently,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\!\\left[r(t)\\, \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] = \\frac{g \\alpha}{\\tau}\\, t \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right).\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from $0$ to $t$ yields\n$$\nr(t)\\, \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) - r(0) = \\frac{g \\alpha}{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{t} s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds.\n$$\nUsing $r(0) = 0$, we need to evaluate the integral\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds.\n$$\nWe compute this integral by integration by parts. Let $u = s$ and $dv = \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds$. Then $du = ds$ and $v = \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right)$. Thus\n$$\n\\int s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds = s \\cdot \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) - \\int \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds = \\tau s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) - \\tau^{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) + C.\n$$\nEvaluating from $0$ to $t$ gives\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds = \\left[\\tau s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) - \\tau^{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{t} = \\tau t \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) - \\tau^{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) - \\left(0 - \\tau^{2}\\right).\n$$\nHence\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} s \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{s}{\\tau}\\right) ds = \\tau t \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) - \\tau^{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + \\tau^{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting into the expression for $r(t)$, we obtain\n\\begin{align*}\nr(t)\\, \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = \\frac{g \\alpha}{\\tau} \\left[\\tau t \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) - \\tau^{2} \\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) + \\tau^{2}\\right], \\\\\nr(t) = g \\alpha \\left[t - \\tau + \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right].\n\\end{align*}\nNow compute the tracking error:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\epsilon(t) = r(t) - g \\alpha t \\\\\n= g \\alpha \\left[t - \\tau + \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] - g \\alpha t \\\\\n= g \\alpha \\left[-\\tau + \\tau \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right] \\\\\n= -\\, g \\alpha \\tau \\left[1 - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right].\n\\end{align*}\nThis closed-form expression shows that the error starts at $0$ for $t = 0$ and evolves monotonically to a constant offset as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\epsilon(t) = -\\, g \\alpha \\tau.\n$$\nThis behavior is a hallmark of a first-order low-pass system tracking a ramp input: the leaky integrator cannot perfectly keep up with a linearly increasing signal and instead exhibits a steady lag proportional to the ramp slope $\\alpha$, the gain $g$, and the time constant $\\tau$.\n\nTo determine conditions for accurate tracking in the sense that $|\\epsilon(t)|$ remains below a fixed tolerance $\\eta  0$ for all $t \\geq 0$, we analyze the magnitude of the error. Because $\\exp\\!\\left(-t/\\tau\\right)$ decreases monotonically from $1$ to $0$, $\\epsilon(t)$ decreases monotonically from $0$ to $- g \\alpha \\tau$. Therefore\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\geq 0} |\\epsilon(t)| = g \\alpha \\tau.\n$$\nA necessary and sufficient condition to ensure $|\\epsilon(t)| \\leq \\eta$ for all $t \\geq 0$ is thus\n$$\ng \\alpha \\tau \\leq \\eta.\n$$\nPhysically, this constraint formalizes the intuitive requirement that the product of input slope and system time constant (scaled by gain) must be sufficiently small for the leaky population to track the ramp within the specified tolerance.\n\nThe final requested output is the exact closed-form expression for the tracking error $\\epsilon(t)$.",
