For a fixed neuron, assume spiking in each trial is generated by an inhomogeneous Poisson process with deterministic conditional intensity function $\\lambda(t)$, which is piecewise continuous and bounded on compact time intervals.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is determined to be a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in computational neuroscience. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive the variance of the Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH) estimator, $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)$, and analyze its scaling behavior for small bin widths $\\Delta$. The estimator is given by\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t) = \\frac{1}{N \\Delta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_i(t;\\Delta)\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of trials, $\\Delta$ is the bin width, and $K_i(t;\\Delta)$ is the number of spikes from trial $i$ in the time interval $[t, t+\\Delta)$.\n\nFirst, we derive an exact expression for the variance, $\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)]$. Using the properties of variance, we can write:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] = \\operatorname{Var}\\left[ \\frac{1}{N \\Delta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_i(t;\\Delta) \\right]\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{1}{N \\Delta}$ is a constant, so it can be factored out by squaring it:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] = \\left(\\frac{1}{N \\Delta}\\right)^2 \\operatorname{Var}\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} K_i(t;\\Delta) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem states that the trials are independent. For a sum of independent random variables, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] = \\frac{1}{N^2 \\Delta^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\operatorname{Var}[K_i(t;\\Delta)]\n$$\nFurthermore, the trials are described as identical, meaning the statistical properties of the spike counts are the same for each trial $i$. Thus, $\\operatorname{Var}[K_i(t;\\Delta)]$ does not depend on $i$. We can denote this common variance as $\\operatorname{Var}[K(t;\\Delta)]$. The sum simplifies to $N$ times this common variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] = \\frac{1}{N^2 \\Delta^2} \\left( N \\cdot \\operatorname{Var}[K(t;\\Delta)] \\right) = \\frac{1}{N \\Delta^2} \\operatorname{Var}[K(t;\\Delta)]\n$$\nNow, we must determine $\\operatorname{Var}[K(t;\\Delta)]$. The problem states that spike generation in each trial follows an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function $\\lambda(\\tau)$. A fundamental property of such a process is that the number of events (spikes) in any interval $[a, b]$ is a Poisson-distributed random variable. The mean (and also the variance) of this Poisson distribution is equal to the integral of the rate function over that interval. Therefore, the spike count $K(t;\\Delta)$ in the interval $[t, t+\\Delta)$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean parameter $\\mu$ given by:\n$$\n\\mu = E[K(t;\\Delta)] = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta} \\lambda(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nFor a Poisson random variable, the variance is equal to its mean. Thus:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[K(t;\\Delta)] = \\mu = \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta} \\lambda(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the variance of the estimator, we obtain the exact expression:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] = \\frac{1}{N \\Delta^2} \\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta} \\lambda(\\tau) \\, d\\tau\n$$\nThis is the exact variance of the PSTH estimator under the given assumptions.\n\nNext, we are asked to find the leading-order scaling of this variance for a sufficiently small bin width $\\Delta$, assuming $\\lambda(t)$ is continuous at time $t$. We need to approximate the integral $\\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta} \\lambda(\\tau) \\, d\\tau$. For a small interval of width $\\Delta$, and a continuous function $\\lambda(\\tau)$, the integral can be approximated by the value of the function at the start of the interval multiplied by the interval's width. This corresponds to the first-order term in the Taylor expansion of the integrated function. More formally, if we define $F(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda(\\tau) d\\tau$, then the integral is $F(t+\\Delta) - F(t)$. By Taylor's theorem, $F(t+\\Delta) = F(t) + F'(t)\\Delta + O(\\Delta^2)$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $F'(t) = \\lambda(t)$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{t}^{t+\\Delta} \\lambda(\\tau) \\, d\\tau = \\lambda(t)\\Delta + O(\\Delta^2)\n$$\nwhere $O(\\Delta^2)$ denotes terms of order $\\Delta^2$ and higher, which are negligible for sufficiently small $\\Delta$. The leading-order term is $\\lambda(t)\\Delta$.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the exact variance expression gives the leading-order scaling:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] \\approx \\frac{1}{N \\Delta^2} (\\lambda(t) \\Delta)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final result for the leading-order variance:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}[\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)] \\approx \\frac{\\lambda(t)}{N \\Delta}\n$$\nThis result has significant practical implications for experimental design. It reveals the trade-off between the precision of the estimate (inverse of variance) and its temporal resolution. The variance is inversely proportional to both the number of trials $N$ and the bin width $\\Delta$.\nTo decrease the variance and obtain a more reliable estimate, one must increase the product $N\\Delta$. This can be achieved by:\n1.  Increasing the number of trials, $N$. This reduces variance without compromising temporal resolution. However, acquiring a large number of trials can be time-consuming or experimentally infeasible.\n2.  Increasing the bin width, $\\Delta$. This also reduces variance by averaging over more spikes. However, using a larger $\\Delta$ leads to a loss of temporal resolution. The estimator $\\hat{\\lambda}_{\\Delta}(t)$ no longer approximates the instantaneous rate $\\lambda(t)$, but rather the average rate over the bin $[t, t+\\Delta)$. This introduces a systematic error, or bias, particularly if $\\lambda(t)$ changes rapidly.\n\nThis is the classic bias-variance trade-off. To achieve a high-fidelity estimate (low bias and low variance), one desires a small $\\Delta$ for high temporal resolution and a large $N$ to suppress the noise. The scaling $\\operatorname{Var} \\propto (N\\Delta)^{-1}$ quantifies this relationship, showing that to halve the bin width $\\Delta$ while keeping the variance constant, one must double the number of experimental trials $N$.",

Let the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) be defined over a fixed partition of the analysis window with bin edges $\\{b_j\\}$ and uniform bin width $\\Delta = b_{j+1} - b_j$.

            "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the conditions under which two procedures for constructing a peristimulus time histogram (PSTH), \"Average then Bin\" ($\\mathrm{AB}$) and \"Bin then Average\" ($\\mathrm{BA}$), yield identical results.\n\nLet's first establish the mathematical relationship between the two procedures under the ideal conditions defined in the problem statement.\n\nThe spike train for trial $i$ is given by $s_i(t) = \\sum_{k} \\delta(t - t_{i}^{(k)})$.\nThe binning operator for bin $j$ with width $\\Delta$ is $B_j[s] := \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s(t)\\, dt$.\nThe trial-averaging operator is $A[s_1,\\dots,s_N] := \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i(t)$.\n\nProcedure $\\mathrm{AB}$ (\"Average then Bin\") yields the rate estimate $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j$:\n$$ \\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j := B_j[A[s_1,\\dots,s_N]] = B_j\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i(t)\\right] $$\nSubstituting the definition of the binning operator $B_j$, we get:\n$$ \\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i(t)\\right) dt $$\nSince the integral is a linear operator and the summation is finite, we can interchange the order of integration and summation.

This equivalence is a direct result of the linearity of both the averaging and binning operators, which allows for the interchange of their order. This holds provided that the operators are applied consistently across all trials (e.g., same bins, same weights).\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. If every trial has full coverage of every bin in the common partition, all trials are equally weighted, and the binning operator is the linear spike-count per unit time on the common bins, then $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BA})}_j$ for all bins $j$.**\nThis statement precisely lists the ideal conditions under which our derivation holds. \"Full coverage of every bin\" ensures the integration domain $[b_j, b_{j+1}]$ is valid for all $s_i(t)$. \"Common partition\" means the binning operator $B_j$ is the same for all trials. \"Equally weighted\" corresponds to the $\\frac{1}{N}$ factor in the averaging operator $A$. \"Binning operator is linear\" is given by its definition as an integral. As demonstrated by the derivation above, under these conditions, the two procedures are mathematically identical.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The two procedures coincide only when spikes are generated by a homogeneous Poisson process with constant firing rate; otherwise, they generally differ.**\nThe mathematical equivalence $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BA})}_j$ depends only on the linearity of the averaging and binning operators. The derivation above makes no assumptions about the stochastic process that generates the spike times $t_i^{(k)}$. The equivalence holds for any set of spike trains $\\{s_i(t)\\}$, regardless of whether they are generated by a Poisson process (homogeneous or inhomogeneous), a renewal process, or any other point process. Therefore, this statement imposes an unnecessarily restrictive and incorrect condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If some trials end early so that not all bins are covered by every trial, using a constant denominator $N$ in $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i(t)\\, dt$ can bias estimates downward in under-covered bins relative to $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BA})}_j$ computed with only contributing trials in those bins, and thus the two procedures differ.**\nThis option describes a common practical issue. Let $I_j$ be the set of trial indices that fully cover bin $j$, and let $N_j = |I_j|$ be the number of such trials. If some trials end early, we may have $N_j < N$ for some bins $j$.\nThe strictly defined $\\mathrm{AB}$ procedure, as given, is $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\frac{1}{N\\Delta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t)\\, dt$. Since $\\int s_i(t) dt = 0$ for trials that do not cover the bin, this sum is effectively $\\frac{1}{N\\Delta} \\sum_{i \\in I_j} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t)\\, dt$.\nThe statement refers to a version of the $\\mathrm{BA}$ procedure \"computed with only contributing trials\". This is the statistically sound way to compute the average rate for bin $j$, which is to average only over the $N_j$ trials that actually provide data for that bin: $\\hat r_j^{\\text{correct}} = \\frac{1}{N_j\\Delta} \\sum_{i \\in I_j} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t)\\, dt$.\nComparing the two, we see that $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\frac{N_j}{N} \\hat r_j^{\\text{correct}}$. Since $N_j \\le N$, the $\\mathrm{AB}$ procedure (with its constant denominator $N$) produces a downwardly biased estimate compared to the correctly normalized practical $\\mathrm{BA}$ procedure. Since the two procedures, as they are often implemented in practice to handle this exact issue, produce different results ($\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j \\neq \\hat r_j^{\\text{correct}}$ when $N_j < N$), the statement is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Applying nonlinear per-trial normalizations (for example, dividing each $s_i(t)$ by its total spike count before averaging) breaks the commutativity between averaging and binning, and the two procedures can yield different PSTHs.**\nLet's analyze the effect of a nonlinear per-trial normalization. Let $K_i = \\int s_i(t) dt$ be the total spike count for trial $i$. Let the normalization operator be $NL_i[s_i] = s_i/K_i$. This operator is nonlinear. The core issue is that the averaging operator $A$ and the normalization operator $NL_i$ do not commute.\nLet's consider how the two philosophies (AB vs BA) would incorporate this normalization step.\n- A BA-style approach would be to process each trial first: bin, then normalize that trial's binned counts by its total count $K_i$, and finally average the results. Let $c_{ij} = \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t) dt$ be the count in bin $j$ for trial $i$. The rate estimate would be $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BNA})}_j = \\frac{1}{N\\Delta}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\frac{c_{ij}}{K_i}$.\n- An AB-style approach would be to average first: average the spike trains to get $s_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i s_i$ and average the total counts to get $\\bar{K} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i K_i$. Then, normalize the averaged signal by the averaged total count (or, equivalently, the total count of the averaged signal, $\\int s_{\\text{avg}} dt = \\bar{K}$) and bin the result. This would yield $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{ANB})}_j = B_j[s_{\\text{avg}} / \\bar{K}] = \\frac{1}{\\bar{K}\\Delta} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_{\\text{avg}}(t) dt = \\frac{1}{(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i K_i) N\\Delta} \\sum_i c_{ij} = \\frac{\\sum_i c_{ij}}{(\\sum_i K_i)\\Delta}$.\nThe two resulting expressions, $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BNA})}_j$ and $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{ANB})}_j$, are not equal in general. The former is an average of ratios, while the latter is a ratio of averages. Because the introduction of the nonlinear normalization step leads to different results depending on its position relative to the averaging step, the overall procedures differ. The statement correctly identifies this.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Using different bin widths across trials has no effect on commutativity; the two procedures still coincide.**\nThis statement contradicts the conditions for equivalence. If the bin width $\\Delta_i$ is trial-dependent, the binning operator $B_j^{(i)}[s] = \\frac{1}{\\Delta_i} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s(t) dt$ also becomes trial-dependent.\n- Procedure $\\mathrm{BA}$ becomes: $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{BA})}_j = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} B_j^{(i)}[s_i] = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{\\Delta_i} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t)\\, dt$.\n- Procedure $\\mathrm{AB}$ is ill-defined, as there is no single binning operator to apply to the averaged signal $s_{\\text{avg}}$. If we were to enforce a common bin width $\\Delta$ at the end, the result would be $\\hat r^{(\\mathrm{AB})}_j = \\frac{1}{N\\Delta} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\int_{b_j}^{b_{j+1}} s_i(t) dt$.\nThese two expressions are clearly not equal unless all $\\Delta_i$ are equal to $\\Delta$. The term $1/\\Delta_i$ cannot be factored out of the summation in the $\\mathrm{BA}$ expression. Therefore, using different bin widths breaks the equivalence. The statement claims the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The probability distribution is Poisson with expected count $\\mu_t = \\lambda_t \\Delta$.\n- **Rate Estimation**:\n    - The unsmoothed peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) rate from training trials is $\\hat{r}_t$, calculated as the average spike count per bin divided by $\\Delta$.\n    - The smoothed rate estimate is $\\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma)$, obtained by convolving $\\hat{r}_t$ with a discrete, normalized Gaussian kernel $K_{\\sigma}$ of bandwidth $\\sigma$.\n- **Cross-Validation**:\n    - A leave-one-trial-out cross-validation (LOOCV) scheme is mandated.\n    - For each held-out trial $r$, a training PSTH is constructed from all other trials.\n    - The held-out negative log-likelihood (NLL) is computed over all bins $t$ using the Poisson NLL for the observed count $y_{r,t}$ given the expected count $\\mu_t(\\sigma) = \\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma)\\Delta$.\n    - The natural logarithm (nats) must be used.\n    - A strictly positive floor must be applied to $\\mu_t(\\sigma)$ to prevent numerical errors with logarithms.\n    - The NLL is averaged across all held-out trials for each candidate $\\sigma$.\n- **Selection Criterion**: Select the candidate $\\sigma$ that minimizes the average held-out NLL. In case of a tie, the smallest $\\sigma$ must be chosen.\n- **Units**: Time in seconds (s), firing rates in Hertz (Hz), NLL in nats.\n- **Test Suite**:\n    - **Test Case 1**: $\\Delta = 0.01$ s, $T = 50$ bins, $R = 6$ trials. Spike times: Trial 1: $[0.217, 0.237, 0.257]$, Trial 2: $[0.218, 0.238, 0.258]$, Trial 3: $[0.219, 0.239, 0.259]$, Trial 4: $[0.221, 0.241, 0.261]$, Trial 5: $[0.222, 0.242, 0.262]$, Trial 6: $[0.223, 0.243, 0.263]$. Candidate $\\sigma$ values: $[0.005, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04]$ s.\n    - **Test Case 2**: $\\Delta = 0.01$ s, $T = 60$ bins, $R = 5$ trials. All trials have spike times: $[0.15, 0.151, 0.30, 0.301]$ s. Candidate $\\sigma$ values: $[0.001, 0.005, 0.02]$ s.\n    - **Test Case 3**: $\\Delta = 0.01$ s, $T = 40$ bins, $R = 4$ trials. All trials have no spikes: $[]$. Candidate $\\sigma$ values: $[0.005, 0.02, 0.08]$ s.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on standard and fundamental techniques in computational neuroscience. The use of an inhomogeneous Poisson process to model neural spiking, the construction of a PSTH to estimate firing rates, Gaussian kernel smoothing for regularization, and cross-validation for model selection (in this case, hyperparameter tuning) are all well-established methodologies.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The objective function (average held-out NLL) is clearly defined. The search for the optimal parameter is over a finite, discrete set of candidate values for $\\sigma$. The explicit tie-breaking rule (select the smallest $\\sigma$) ensures a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All necessary parameters, data, and procedures are specified, leaving no room for subjective interpretation.\n- **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, realistic, and well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A principled, step-by-step solution will be developed.\n\n### Theoretical Framework and Algorithmic Design\n\nThe core task is to select an optimal smoothing bandwidth $\\sigma$ for a PSTH-based firing rate model. This is a model selection problem, which is addressed using leave-one-trial-out cross-validation to estimate the generalization performance of the model for different values of $\\sigma$.\n\n**1. Spiking Model and Likelihood**\nWe model the neuron's spike train as a realization of an inhomogeneous Poisson process, characterized by a time-varying instantaneous firing rate, $\\lambda(t)$. For a small time bin of width $\\Delta$, the number of spikes $y_t$ occurring in that bin is approximately Poisson distributed:\n$$y_t \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\mu_t)$$\nwhere the expected spike count $\\mu_t \\approx \\lambda_t \\Delta$, with $\\lambda_t$ being the rate in bin $t$. The probability mass function is:\n$$P(y_t | \\mu_t) = \\frac{\\mu_t^{y_t} e^{-\\mu_t}}{y_t!}$$\nThe log-likelihood for observing a single count $y_t$ is $\\log P(y_t | \\mu_t) = y_t \\log(\\mu_t) - \\mu_t - \\log(y_t!)$. The negative log-likelihood (NLL) is its negation. For an entire trial with counts $y_t$ across $T$ bins, the total NLL is the sum over all bins. When comparing models based on different $\\sigma$ values, the term $\\sum_t \\log(y_t!)$ is constant and can be ignored. The objective function to be minimized for a given trial is thus:\n$$L(\\sigma) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\mu_t(\\sigma) - y_t \\log(\\mu_t(\\sigma)) \\right)$$\n\n**2. Rate Estimation and Smoothing**\nThe underlying rate $\\lambda(t)$ is unknown and must be estimated from the data. The LOOCV procedure dictates that for each held-out trial, we estimate the rate from the remaining $R-1$ training trials.\n\nFirst, an unsmoothed rate estimate, the PSTH $\\hat{r}_t$, is computed. For a set of $R-1$ training trials, the total number of spikes in bin $t$ is summed, and this sum is then averaged and normalized by the bin width $\\Delta$:\n$$\\hat{r}_t = \\frac{1}{(R-1)\\Delta} \\sum_{r \\in \\text{training}} y_{r,t}$$\nThis estimate is often noisy. To obtain a smoother, more robust estimate, $\\hat{r}_t$ is convolved with a discrete Gaussian kernel $K_\\sigma$. The kernel is centered at $0$ and its values at discrete bin offsets $j$ are given by:\n$$K[j] \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(j\\Delta)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nThe kernel is normalized such that $\\sum_j K[j] = 1$. The smoothed rate estimate $\\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma)$ is then the discrete convolution of the unsmoothed rate with the kernel:\n$$\\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma) = (\\hat{r} * K_\\sigma)_t = \\sum_j K[j] \\hat{r}_{t-j}$$\nFor finite-length signals, boundary conditions must be considered. Circular convolution (or wrap-around boundaries) is a standard and computationally convenient choice, implying that the signal is periodic.\n\n**3. Leave-One-Trial-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**\nThe LOOCV process provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the model's generalization error. The algorithm for selecting the optimal $\\sigma$ from a set of candidates $\\{\\sigma_k\\}$ is as follows:\n\nFor each candidate bandwidth $\\sigma_k$:\n1. Initialize an empty list, `nll_scores`.\n2. For each trial $r_{\\text{out}} \\in \\{1, \\dots, R\\}$:\n    a. Designate trial $r_{\\text{out}}$ as the test set, with spike counts $y_{\\text{test}, t} = y_{r_{\\text{out}}, t}$.\n    b. Designate the remaining $R-1$ trials as the training set.\n    c. Compute the unsmoothed PSTH rate $\\hat{r}_t$ from the training set.\n    d. Convolve $\\hat{r}_t$ with the Gaussian kernel $K_{\\sigma_k}$ to get the smoothed rate $\\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma_k)$. A practical approach is to use `scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d` with `mode='wrap'`, setting its `sigma` parameter to $\\sigma_k / \\Delta$.\n    e. Calculate the predicted mean spike counts for the test trial: $\\mu_t(\\sigma_k) = \\tilde{r}_t(\\sigma_k) \\Delta$.\n    f. To ensure numerical stability, apply a small positive floor to the predicted means: $\\mu_t'(\\sigma_k) = \\max(\\mu_t(\\sigma_k), \\epsilon)$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small constant like $10^{-9}$.\n    g. Compute the NLL objective for this fold: $L_{r_{\\text{out}}}(\\sigma_k) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} \\left( \\mu_t'(\\sigma_k) - y_{\\text{test}, t} \\log(\\mu_t'(\\sigma_k)) \\right)$.\n    h. Append $L_{r_{\\text{out}}}(\\sigma_k)$ to `nll_scores`.\n3. Compute the average NLL for $\\sigma_k$: $\\bar{L}(\\sigma_k) = \\frac{1}{R} \\sum_{i=1}^{R} \\text{nll\\_scores}[i]$.\n\nAfter completing this process for all candidate $\\sigma_k$, the optimal bandwidth $\\sigma^*$ is selected:\n$$\\sigma^* = \\arg\\min_{\\sigma_k} \\{ \\bar{L}(\\sigma_k) \\}$$\nThe tie-breaking rule requires that if multiple $\\sigma_k$ yield the same minimum average NLL, the smallest of these $\\sigma_k$ values is chosen.\n\nThis procedure is implemented for each test case provided in the problem statement.",
