Before we can model how the brain computes interaural time differences, we must first quantify the temporal precision of the signals it receives from each ear.

            "problem": "Consider a population model of auditory nerve fibers driving coincidence detectors in the Medial Superior Olive (MSO) for interaural time difference processing in sound localization. Each fiber responds to a monaural pure tone of frequency $f$ with one spike per stimulus cycle, with spike timing subject to additive temporal jitter that is independent across cycles. Let the $n$-th spike time be $t_{n} = n T + \\delta_{n}$, where $T = 1/f$ is the stimulus period, and $\\delta_{n}$ are independent and identically distributed zero-mean Gaussian random variables with standard deviation $\\sigma_{t}$, modeling cycle-to-cycle timing jitter. Phases are measured in radians. The spike phase on cycle $n$, relative to the tone, is defined as $\\phi_{n} = (2 \\pi f) t_{n} \\bmod 2 \\pi$. The vector strength $R$ of the spike train is defined by the core circular-statistics relation $R = \\left| \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(i \\phi_{n}) \\right|$ for $N$ spikes, and its large-$N$ limit is the magnitude of the first trigonometric moment of the phase distribution.\n\nStarting from these definitions and modeling assumptions, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the expected vector strength $R$ in the large-$N$ limit as a function of $f$ and $\\sigma_{t}$. Your final answer must be a single analytical expression and must be dimensionless. Also, within your derivation, explain qualitatively how $R$ changes as the timing jitter $\\sigma_{t}$ increases, but express the final answer only as the analytic expression for $R(f,\\sigma_{t})$.",
            "solution": "The vector strength, $R$, is defined in the limit of a large number of spikes ($N \\to \\infty$) as the magnitude of the expected value of the complex phasor $\\exp(i\\phi)$. By the law of large numbers, the sample mean converges to the expectation:\n$$\nR = \\left| \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\exp(i \\phi_{n}) \\right| = |\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i\\phi)]|\n$$\nwhere the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[ \\cdot ]$ is taken over the probability distribution of the phase $\\phi$. Since the jitter variables $\\delta_{n}$ are i.i.d., the phase variables $\\phi_{n}$ are also i.i.d., so we can consider a generic phase variable $\\phi$.\n\nThe phase of the $n$-th spike is given by $\\phi_{n} = (2 \\pi f) t_{n} \\bmod 2 \\pi$. We can substitute the expression for $t_n$:\n$$\n\\phi_n = (2 \\pi f) (n T + \\delta_n) \\pmod{2 \\pi}\n$$\nUsing the relationship $T = 1/f$, this becomes:\n$$\n\\phi_n = (2 \\pi f) \\left(\\frac{n}{f} + \\delta_n\\right) \\pmod{2 \\pi} = (2 \\pi n + 2 \\pi f \\delta_n) \\pmod{2 \\pi}\n$$\nSince $n$ is an integer, $2 \\pi n$ represents an integer number of full cycles. The modulo $2 \\pi$ operation removes this term, leaving:\n$$\n\\phi_n = (2 \\pi f \\delta_n) \\pmod{2 \\pi}\n$$\nWe seek to compute $R = |\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i\\phi_n)]|$. An important property of the complex exponential function $\\exp(iz)$ is its periodicity with period $2\\pi i$. This means that $\\exp(iz) = \\exp(i(z \\pmod{2\\pi}))$. Applying this property, the modulo operation inside the expectation becomes irrelevant:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i\\phi_n)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i (2 \\pi f \\delta_n) \\pmod{2 \\pi})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i 2 \\pi f \\delta_n)]\n$$\nThis simplifies the problem significantly, as we now need to compute the expectation of a function of the Gaussian random variable $\\delta_n$ without concern for the modulo arithmetic. The expression $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i k X)]$ is the definition of the characteristic function $\\varphi_X(k)$ of a random variable $X$. Here, our random variable is $\\delta_n$ and the constant is $k = 2\\pi f$. Thus, we need to calculate the characteristic function of $\\delta_n$ evaluated at $2\\pi f$.\n\nThe random variable $\\delta_n$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mu = 0$ and variance $\\sigma_t^2$. The characteristic function of a general Gaussian random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\varphi_X(k) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ikX)] = \\exp\\left(i\\mu k - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 k^2\\right)\n$$\nFor our random variable $\\delta_n$, we have $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = \\sigma_t$. We evaluate its characteristic function at $k = 2\\pi f$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i 2 \\pi f \\delta_n)] = \\varphi_{\\delta_n}(2\\pi f) = \\exp\\left(i(0)(2\\pi f) - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 (2\\pi f)^2\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i 2 \\pi f \\delta_n)] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 (4\\pi^2 f^2)\\right) = \\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2)\n$$\nThe vector strength $R$ is the magnitude of this complex number. Since the result is a real, positive number, its magnitude is the number itself.\n$$\nR = \\left| \\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2) \\right| = \\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2)\n$$\nThe argument of the exponent, $-(2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2)$, is dimensionless because the frequency $f$ has units of time$^{-1}$ and the standard deviation of jitter $\\sigma_t$ has units of time. Their product $f \\sigma_t$ is dimensionless. Thus, $R$ is dimensionless as required.\n\nQualitatively, the vector strength $R$ measures the degree of phase-locking. An $R$ of $1$ indicates perfect locking (all spikes at the same phase), while an $R$ of $0$ indicates a complete lack of locking (phases are uniformly distributed). The derived expression for $R$ is $R(f, \\sigma_t) = \\exp(-2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2)$. The function $\\exp(-x)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $x \\ge 0$. The term $2\\pi^2 f^2 \\sigma_t^2$ is always non-negative. As the timing jitter $\\sigma_t$ increases from $0$, the argument of the exponential becomes increasingly negative. Consequently, the value of $R$ decreases from $R=1$ (for $\\sigma_t=0$, no jitter) towards $R=0$ (as $\\sigma_t \\to \\infty$). This correctly models the physical intuition that greater temporal noise in spike timing leads to a degradation of phase-locking to the stimulus.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of key properties of a Jeffress delay-line model from first principles, followed by a numerical calculation and assessment.\n\n**1. Derivation of Internal Delay**\n\nThe relationship between distance, velocity, and time is fundamental to kinematics. For an object or signal traveling at a constant velocity $v$ over a distance $d$, the travel time $t$ is given by:\n$$t = \\frac{d}{v}$$\nIn the Jeffress model, neural signals (action potentials) from the left and right ears propagate along axons acting as delay lines. Let $L_L$ and $L_R$ be the respective path lengths from the left and right ears to a specific coincidence detector neuron. The conduction velocity $v$ is assumed to be homogeneous along these paths.\n\nThe arrival time of the signal from the left ear, $t_L$, and the right ear, $t_R$, at the coincidence detector are:\n$$t_L = \\frac{L_L}{v}$$\n$$t_R = \\frac{L_R}{v}$$\nAn internal delay, which we denote as $\\tau_{int}$, is created by the difference in these arrival times. This delay is intrinsic to the circuit's anatomy and is what the circuit uses to measure the external ITD from the sound source. The internal delay is:\n$$\\tau_{int} = t_L - t_R = \\frac{L_L}{v} - \\frac{L_R}{v} = \\frac{L_L - L_R}{v}$$\nThe term $L_L - L_R$ represents the axonal path length difference, which is denoted in the problem as $\\Delta L$. Therefore, the relationship between the internal delay and the path length difference is:\n$$\\tau_{int} = \\frac{\\Delta L}{v}$$\nThis equation formally links the anatomical structure ($\\Delta L$) to its functional consequence ($\\tau_{int}$) through a biophysical parameter ($v$).\n\n**2. Determination of the Delay Range**\n\nThe delay range is defined as the largest internal delay the array can represent. According to our derived relationship, the internal delay $\\tau_{int}$ is directly proportional to the path length difference $\\Delta L$. Consequently, the maximum internal delay, which we can call $\\tau_{\\max}$, corresponds to the maximum available path length difference, $\\Delta L_{\\max}$.\n$$\\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta L_{\\max}}{v}$$\nThis $\\tau_{\\max}$ represents the full range of ITDs (from $0$ to $\\tau_{\\max}$) that the neural circuit is structured to detect.\n\n**3. Determination of the Delay Resolution**\n\nThe delay resolution is defined as the smallest step in internal delay between adjacent coincidence detectors. The array of coincidence detectors samples the range of internal delays in discrete steps. This anatomical discretization is given by the path length step, $\\delta L$. The smallest non-zero change in internal delay, which we can call $\\delta\\tau$, corresponds to this smallest step in path length difference.\n$$\\delta\\tau = \\frac{\\delta L}{v}$$\nThis quantity $\\delta\\tau$ represents the precision, or resolution, of the ITD map created by the neural circuit.\n\n**4. Numerical Computation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n- Conduction velocity: $v = 5\\,\\text{m/s}$\n- Maximum path length difference: $\\Delta L_{\\max} = 3.744\\,\\text{mm}$\n- Path length step: $\\delta L = 41.6\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n\nFor consistency, we convert all length measurements to meters ($m$):\n- $\\Delta L_{\\max} = 3.744\\,\\text{mm} = 3.744 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\delta L = 41.6\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 41.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}$\n\nNow, we compute the delay range ($\\tau_{\\max}$):\n$$\\tau_{\\max} = \\frac{\\Delta L_{\\max}}{v} = \\frac{3.744 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}}{5\\,\\text{m/s}} = 0.7488 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in microseconds ($\\mu\\text{s}$). Since $1\\,\\text{s} = 10^6\\,\\mu\\text{s}$:\n$$\\tau_{\\max} = 0.7488 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mu\\text{s} = 748.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the delay range is $748.8\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\nNext, we compute the delay resolution ($\\delta\\tau$):\n$$\\delta\\tau = \\frac{\\delta L}{v} = \\frac{41.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}}{5\\,\\text{m/s}} = 8.32 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}$$\nIn microseconds:\n$$\\delta\\tau = 8.32\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the delay resolution is $8.320\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\n**5. Assessment of Resolution Sufficiency**\n\nThe computed delay resolution of the model circuit is $\\delta\\tau = 8.320\\,\\mu\\text{s}$. This value represents the smallest difference in ITD that the neural circuit can distinguish based on its anatomical structure. We are asked to compare this with a representative human psychophysical threshold for ITD discrimination, given as $10\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n\nThe comparison shows that the model's resolution is finer than the perceptual threshold:\n$$8.320\\,\\mu\\text{s}  10\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nThis indicates that the anatomical precision of the Jeffress model, using these biophysically plausible parameters, is sufficient to account for the observed human sensitivity to microsecond-level interaural time differences. The neural substrate provides a processing grid with a step size smaller than the limit of what can be behaviorally reported, which is a necessary condition for any viable neural model of perception.",

Minimum Audible Angle (MAA)**\n\nThe problem defines the MAA, $\\delta\\theta$, as the standard deviation of an optimal estimator, given by the Cramér-Rao lower bound:\n$$\n\\delta\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{J_{\\theta}(0)}}\n$$\nUsing the value of $J_{\\theta}(0)$ we just computed:\n$$\n\\delta\\theta \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{84.535}}\\ \\mathrm{rad} \\approx \\frac{1}{9.1943}\\ \\mathrm{rad} \\approx 0.10876\\ \\mathrm{rad}\n$$\nThe problem requests the answer in degrees. To convert from radians to degrees, we multiply by $\\frac{180}{\\pi}$:\n$$\n\\delta\\theta_{\\mathrm{deg}} = \\delta\\theta \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi} \\approx 0.10876 \\times 57.2958 \\ \\mathrm{degrees} \\approx 6.2307\\ \\mathrm{degrees}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the predicted MAA is $6.23$ degrees.\n\n**4. Comparison with Psychophysical Data**\n\nThe calculated MAA of $6.23^{\\circ}$ is significantly larger than the typical human psychophysical threshold of approximately $1^{\\circ}$ for broadband stimuli near the midline. This indicates that the simple model presented, with the given parameters, is substantially less sensitive at discriminating sound source locations than a human listener. The discrepancy may arise from oversimplifications in the model, such as the number of neurons, the exclusion of other auditory cues (like interaural level differences), or the lack of more sophisticated decoding mechanisms in the brain.",
