            "problem": "Consider a two-population Wilson–Cowan (WC) firing-rate model for an excitatory–inhibitory (E–I) network. At steady state, the population activities satisfy\n$$\nE = f_{E}\\!\\left(w_{EE} E - w_{EI} I + P_{E}\\right),\\quad\nI = f_{I}\\!\\left(w_{IE} E - w_{II} I + P_{I}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $E \\geq 0$ and $I \\geq 0$ are the excitatory and inhibitory activities, $w_{EE}, w_{EI}, w_{IE}, w_{II}$ are synaptic weights, and $P_{E}, P_{I}$ are constant inputs. The gain functions are piecewise-linear, threshold-linear (rectified), given by\n$$\nf_{E}(x) = \\alpha_{E}\\,[x - \\theta_{E}]_{+},\\quad f_{I}(x) = \\alpha_{I}\\,[x - \\theta_{I}]_{+},\\quad [y]_{+} = \\max\\{y,0\\},\n$$\nwith $\\alpha_{E} = \\alpha_{I} = 1$ (unit gain).

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the fixed points of a two-population Wilson-Cowan model. We begin by validating the problem statement.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extracted Givens**\n-   **Steady-state equations**:\n    $E = f_{E}\\!\\left(w_{EE} E - w_{EI} I + P_{E}\\right)$\n    $I = f_{I}\\!\\left(w_{IE} E - w_{II} I + P_{I}\\right)$\n-   **State variables**: $E \\geq 0$ (excitatory activity), $I \\geq 0$ (inhibitory activity).\n-   **Gain functions**: $f_{E}(x) = \\alpha_{E}\\,[x - \\theta_{E}]_{+}$ and $f_{I}(x) = \\alpha_{I}\\,[x - \\theta_{I}]_{+}$, where $[y]_{+} = \\max\\{y,0\\}$.\n-   **Given parameters**:\n    -   $\\alpha_{E} = 1$, $\\alpha_{I} = 1$\n    -   $w_{EE} = 1.3$\n    -   $w_{II} = 0.7$\n    -   $w_{EI} = w_{IE} = g$, with $g \\geq 0$\n    -   $P_{E} = 0.25$\n    -   $P_{I} = 0.6$\n    -   $\\theta_{E} = 0.05$\n    -   $\\theta_{I} = 0.1$\n-   **Derived parameters**:\n    -   Effective offset $B_{E} = P_{E} - \\theta_{E} = 0.25 - 0.05 = 0.20$\n    -   Effective offset $B_{I} = P_{I} - \\theta_{I} = 0.6 - 0.1 = 0.50$\n-   **Task**: Find all admissible fixed points $(E^*, I^*)$ and classify the number of such points (zero, one, or two) based on the value of the coupling strength $g$. Report the two critical values of $g$ that delimit these regimes.\n\n**Step 2: Validation of Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as the Wilson-Cowan model is a canonical model in theoretical neuroscience. The use of a piecewise-linear (rectified linear) gain function is a standard and well-understood simplification. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary parameters and equations to perform a bifurcation analysis of the system's fixed points with respect to the parameter $g$. There are no scientific or logical contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nSubstituting the given parameters and definitions into the steady-state equations, we obtain:\n$$E = [1.3 E - g I + 0.2]_{+}$$\n$$I = [g E - 0.7 I + 0.5]_{+}$$\nWe must find the solutions $(E, I)$ to this system of equations, subject to the constraints $E \\geq 0$ and $I \\geq 0$. The piecewise nature of the equations requires us to analyze four distinct cases based on whether the arguments of the rectifier function $[ \\cdot ]_{+}$ are positive or non-positive.\n\n**Case 1: Both populations are active ($E  0, I  0$)**\nIn this case, the arguments of both rectifier functions must be positive. The equations become linear:\n$$E = 1.3 E - g I + 0.2$$\n$$I = g E - 0.7 I + 0.5$$\nRearranging these equations into a standard linear system form $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$:\n$$(1.3 - 1)E - gI = -0.2 \\quad \\implies \\quad 0.3 E - g I = -0.2$$\n$$-g E + (1 + 0.7)I = 0.5 \\quad \\implies \\quad -g E + 1.7 I = 0.5$$\nThis is a system of two linear equations in $E$ and $I$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3  -g \\\\ -g  1.7 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} E \\\\ I \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix} -0.2 \\\\ 0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of the matrix is $\\Delta = (0.3)(1.7) - (-g)(-g) = 0.51 - g^2$. A unique solution exists for $\\Delta \\neq 0$. Using Cramer's rule, we find the solution $(E^*, I^*)$:\n$$E^* = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -0.2  -g \\\\ 0.5  1.7 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{(-0.2)(1.7) - (-g)(0.5)}{0.51 - g^2} = \\frac{0.5 g - 0.34}{0.51 - g^2}$$\n$$I^* = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0.3  -0.2 \\\\ -g  0.5 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{(0.3)(0.5) - (-0.2)(-g)}{0.51 - g^2} = \\frac{0.15 - 0.2 g}{0.51 - g^2}$$\nFor this fixed point to be admissible, it must satisfy the initial assumption $E^*  0$ and $I^*  0$. We analyze the signs of the numerators and the denominator.\n- Numerator of $E^*$: $0.5 g - 0.34  0 \\implies g  0.68$.\n- Numerator of $I^*$: $0.15 - 0.2 g  0 \\implies g  0.15/0.2 = 0.75$.\n- Denominator: $0.51 - g^2  0 \\implies g^2  0.51 \\implies g  \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx 0.7141$.\n\nWe need the signs of the numerators to match the sign of the denominator.\n- If the denominator is positive ($g  \\sqrt{0.51}$), we need both numerators to be positive. This requires $g  0.68$ and $g  0.75$. Combined with $g  \\sqrt{0.51}$, the condition for admissibility is $g \\in (0.68, \\sqrt{0.51})$.\n- If the denominator is negative ($g  \\sqrt{0.51}$), we need both numerators to be negative. This requires $g  0.68$ and $g  0.75$, which is impossible.\nThus, an admissible fixed point with both populations active exists only for $g \\in (0.68, \\sqrt{0.51})$.\n\n**Case 2: Excitatory population active, inhibitory silent ($E  0, I = 0$)**\nFor a fixed point $(E^*, 0)$ with $E^*  0$, the equations become:\n$$E^* = [1.3 E^* + 0.2]_{+}$$\n$$0 = [g E^* + 0.5]_{+}$$\nThe first equation requires $1.3 E^* + 0.2  0$, which is true for $E^*  0$. It gives $E^* = 1.3 E^* + 0.2$, which solves to $-0.3 E^* = 0.2$, or $E^* = -2/3$. This contradicts the assumption $E^*  0$.\nThe second equation $0 = [g E^* + 0.5]_{+}$ requires the argument to be non-positive: $g E^* + 0.5 \\leq 0$. Since $g \\geq 0$ and we assume $E^*0$, the term $g E^* \\ge 0$, so $g E^* + 0.5 > 0$. Thus, $[g E^* + 0.5]_{+}$ is always positive and can never be zero.\nTherefore, no admissible fixed point exists in this case.\n\n**Case 3: Inhibitory population active, excitatory silent ($E = 0, I  0$)**\nFor a fixed point $(0, I^*)$ with $I^*  0$, the equations become:\n$$0 = [-g I^* + 0.2]_{+}$$\n$$I^* = [-0.7 I^* + 0.5]_{+}$$\nThe first equation requires the argument to be non-positive for the output to be zero: $-g I^* + 0.2 \\leq 0$, which implies $g I^* \\geq 0.2$.\nThe second equation, for $I^*0$, requires its argument to be positive: $-0.7 I^* + 0.5  0$, so $I^*  0.5/0.7 = 5/7$. Under this condition, the equation becomes linear: $I^* = -0.7 I^* + 0.5$, which yields $1.7 I^* = 0.5$, so $I^* = 0.5/1.7 = 5/17$.\nWe check for consistency. The solution $I^* = 5/17$ is indeed positive. Also, $5/17 \\approx 0.294  5/7 \\approx 0.714$, so the condition on the argument is satisfied.\nNow we must satisfy the condition from the first equation: $g I^* \\geq 0.2$. Substituting $I^* = 5/17$:\n$$g \\left(\\frac{5}{17}\\right) \\geq 0.2 \\implies g \\geq 0.2 \\times \\frac{17}{5} = \\frac{3.4}{5} = 0.68$$\nAn admissible fixed point $(0, 5/17)$ exists if and only if $g \\geq 0.68$.\n\n**Case 4: Both populations silent ($E = 0, I = 0$)**\nThe fixed-point equations must be satisfied:\n$$0 = [1.3(0) - g(0) + 0.2]_{+} = [0.2]_{+} = 0.2$$\nThis gives the contradiction $0 = 0.2$. Therefore, the origin $(0, 0)$ is never a fixed point for the given parameters.\n\n### Synthesis and Bifurcation Analysis\n\nLet's summarize the findings.\n- **FP1 (E-I active):** $(E^*, I^*) = \\left( \\frac{0.5g - 0.34}{0.51 - g^2}, \\frac{0.15 - 0.2g}{0.51 - g^2} \\right)$. Admissible for $g \\in (0.68, \\sqrt{0.51})$.\n- **FP2 (I-only active):** $(0, 5/17)$. Admissible for $g \\geq 0.68$.\n- No other types of admissible fixed points exist.\n\nLet's classify the number of equilibria based on $g$. Let $g_{c1} = 0.68$ and $g_{c2} = \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx 0.7141$.\n\n- **Regime A: $g \\in [0, 0.68)$**\n  - FP1 is not admissible.\n  - FP2 is not admissible.\n  - Number of equilibria: **Zero**.\n\n- **Regime B: $g = 0.68$**\n  - For FP1, the numerator of $E^*$ is $0.5(0.68) - 0.34 = 0$, so $E^*=0$. The expression for $I^*$ becomes $I^* = \\frac{0.15 - 0.2(0.68)}{0.51 - (0.68)^2} = \\frac{0.014}{0.0476} = \\frac{5}{17}$. So FP1 becomes $(0, 5/17)$.\n  - FP2 is $(0, 5/17)$ and its condition $g \\geq 0.68$ is met at the boundary.\n  - At $g=0.68$, both fixed points merge into one.\n  - Number of equilibria: **One**.\n\n- **Regime C: $g \\in (0.68, \\sqrt{0.51})$**\n  - FP1 is admissible.\n  - FP2 is admissible.\n  - These two fixed points are distinct since for FP1, $E^*  0$.\n  - Number of equilibria: **Two**.\n\n- **Regime D: $g \\in [\\sqrt{0.51}, \\infty)$**\n  - FP1 is not admissible (denominator becomes zero or negative).\n  - FP2 is admissible since $g \\geq \\sqrt{0.51}  0.68$.\n  - Number of equilibria: **One**.\n\nThe number of admissible equilibria as a function of $g$ follows the sequence: 0, 1 (at a point), 2, 1. The regimes are:\n-   No equilibria: $g \\in [0, 0.68)$\n-   One equilibrium: $g \\in \\{0.68\\} \\cup [\\sqrt{0.51}, \\infty)$\n-   Two equilibria: $g \\in (0.68, \\sqrt{0.51})$\n\nThe question asks for \"the two critical values of $g$ that delimit these regimes\". The regimes of zero, one, and two solutions are delimited by the critical values $g = 0.68$ and $g = \\sqrt{0.51}$. At $g = 0.68$, a single equilibrium appears, from which an additional branch of equilibria emerges for $g>0.68$. At $g = \\sqrt{0.51}$, the E-I active fixed point vanishes, reducing the number of solutions from two to one. The two critical values that mark the boundaries of the regime with two equilibria are thus $g_{c1} = 0.68$ and $g_{c2} = \\sqrt{0.51}$.\n\nWe are asked to round these values to four significant figures.\n$g_{c1} = 0.68 = 0.6800$.\n$g_{c2} = \\sqrt{0.51} \\approx 0.7141428...$, which rounds to $0.7141$.\n\nThese two values delimit the region of bistability, which is the most consequential feature of the system's bifurcation structure.",

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe stability of an equilibrium point $(r_{e}^{*}, r_{i}^{*})$ of a dynamical system is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at that point. Let the system be represented by $\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{r})$, where $\\mathbf{r} = (r_e, r_i)^T$. We linearize the system by considering small perturbations $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}^{*}$ around the equilibrium.

At equilibrium, this becomes $\\frac{g_{e}w_{ee} - 1}{\\tau_{e}}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_{e}}{\\partial r_{i}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{e}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_{i}} \\phi_{e}(\\dots) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{e}} \\left[ \\phi_{e}'(\\dots) \\cdot (-w_{ei}) \\right]$. At equilibrium, this is $\\frac{-g_{e}w_{ei}}{\\tau_{e}}$.\n- $\\frac{\\partial F_{i}}{\\partial r_{e}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r_{e}} \\phi_{i}(\\dots) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{i}} \\left[ \\phi_{i}'(\\dots) \\cdot w_{ie} \\right]$.

At equilibrium, this is $\\frac{-g_{i}w_{ii} - 1}{\\tau_{i}}$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix at the equilibrium is therefore:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{w_{ee} g_{e} - 1}{\\tau_{e}}  \\frac{-w_{ei} g_{e}}{\\tau_{e}} \\\\\n\\frac{w_{ie} g_{i}}{\\tau_{i}}  \\frac{-w_{ii} g_{i} - 1}{\\tau_{i}}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $\\tau_{e} = 0.02$, $\\tau_{i} = 0.01$, $w_{ee} = 12$, $w_{ei} = 30$, $w_{ie} = 13$, $w_{ii} = 11$, $g_{e} = 0.05$, and $g_{i} = 0.08$. The units of the parameters $\\tau_e, \\tau_i$ are seconds ($\\mathrm{s}$), while all other parameters are dimensionless. This implies the elements of the Jacobian matrix will have units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe elements of the Jacobian are:\n- $J_{11} = \\frac{12 \\cdot 0.05 - 1}{0.02} = \\frac{0.6 - 1}{0.02} = \\frac{-0.4}{0.02} = -20$\n- $J_{12} = \\frac{-30 \\cdot 0.05}{0.02} = \\frac{-1.5}{0.02} = -75$\n- $J_{21} = \\frac{13 \\cdot 0.08}{0.01} = \\frac{1.04}{0.01} = 104$\n- $J_{22} = \\frac{-11 \\cdot 0.08 - 1}{0.01} = \\frac{-0.88 - 1}{0.01} = \\frac{-1.88}{0.01} = -188$\n\nSo, the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-20  -75 \\\\\n104  -188\n\\end{pmatrix} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe characteristic equation for the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ is $\\det(J - \\lambda I) = 0$, which for a $2 \\times 2$ matrix expands to $\\lambda^2 - \\mathrm{tr}(J)\\lambda + \\det(J) = 0$. The solutions (eigenvalues) are given by the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{\\mathrm{tr}(J) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\mathrm{tr}(J))^2 - 4\\det(J)}}{2}$. The discriminant of this characteristic polynomial is $\\Delta = (\\mathrm{tr}(J))^2 - 4\\det(J)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the trace of the Jacobian, $\\mathrm{tr}(J)$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(J) = J_{11} + J_{22} = -20 + (-188) = -208 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we compute the determinant of the Jacobian, $\\det(J)$:\n$$\n\\det(J) = J_{11}J_{22} - J_{12}J_{21} = (-20)(-188) - (-75)(104) = 3760 - (-7800) = 3760 + 7800 = 11560 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nNow we compute the discriminant $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = (\\mathrm{tr}(J))^2 - 4\\det(J) = (-208)^2 - 4(11560)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 43264 - 46240 = -2976 \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}\n$$\nThe problem asks to round the answer to six significant figures. The calculated value $-2976$ is an exact integer. To express this with six significant figures, we write it as $-2976.00$.\n\nFor completeness, we can classify the fixed point. Since $\\mathrm{tr}(J) = -208  0$ and $\\det(J) = 11560  0$, the equilibrium is stable. Since the discriminant $\\Delta = -2976  0$, the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, which means the equilibrium is a stable focus (or spiral sink).

            "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze a linearized two-population Wilson-Cowan firing-rate model. The analysis consists of two parts: first, to determine if the network operates in an Inhibition-Stabilized Network (ISN) regime, and second, to compute the steady-state linear response of the network to a selective external input to the inhibitory population.\n\nThe dynamics of the system are given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} r_E \\\\ r_I \\end{pmatrix}\n\\;=\\; -\\,\\begin{pmatrix} r_E \\\\ r_I \\end{pmatrix} \\;+\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix} g_E  0 \\\\ 0  g_I \\end{pmatrix}\n\\left(\nW \\begin{pmatrix} r_E \\\\ r_I \\end{pmatrix} \\;+\\; \\begin{pmatrix} I_E \\\\ I_I \\end{pmatrix}\n\\right)\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{r} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_E \\\\ r_I \\end{pmatrix}$, $\\mathbf{I}_{ext} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_E \\\\ I_I \\end{pmatrix}$, and $G = \\begin{pmatrix} g_E  0 \\\\ 0  g_I \\end{pmatrix}$. The equation can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = -\\mathbf{r} + G(W\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{I}_{ext}) = (GW - I)\\mathbf{r} + G\\mathbf{I}_{ext}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. This is a linear system of the form $\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = J\\mathbf{r} + \\mathbf{b}$, where the Jacobian matrix is $J = GW - I$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$g_E = 2$, $g_I = 1$, and $W = \\begin{pmatrix} w_{EE}  -w_{EI} \\\\ w_{IE}  -w_{II} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5}  -\\frac{11}{10} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the matrix product $GW$:\n$$\nGW = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{5}  -\\frac{11}{10} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{5}  2 \\cdot (-\\frac{11}{10}) \\\\ 1 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}  1 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{6}{5}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$:\n$$\nJ = GW - I = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{6}{5}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{6}{5} - 1  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} - 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: ISN Regime Determination**\nAn ISN regime is defined by two conditions:\n1. The full E-I network is linearly stable.\n2. The excitatory-only subnetwork is linearly unstable.\n\nCondition 1: Stability of the full network.\nThe stability of the linear system is determined by the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix $J$. The system is stable if and only if all eigenvalues have negative real parts. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this is true if and only if its trace is negative and its determinant is positive.\nThe trace of $J$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(J) = \\frac{1}{5} + (-\\frac{3}{2}) = \\frac{2 - 15}{10} = -\\frac{13}{10}\n$$\nSince $\\text{Tr}(J) = -\\frac{13}{10}  0$, the first part of the stability criterion is met.\nThe determinant of $J$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Det}(J) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{3}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{11}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{10} + \\frac{33}{10} = \\frac{30}{10} = 3\n$$\nSince $\\text{Det}(J) = 3  0$, the second part of the stability criterion is met.\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so the full network is linearly stable. This aligns with the problem's premise that a stable operating point exists.\n\nCondition 2: Instability of the excitatory-only subnetwork.\nThe excitatory-only subnetwork's dynamics are found by considering the dynamics of $r_E$ in isolation. The equation for $r_E$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dr_E}{dt} = -r_E + g_E(w_{EE}r_E - w_{EI}r_I + I_E)\n$$\nTo analyze the stability of the E-subnetwork by itself, we consider perturbations in $r_E$ while ignoring feedback from the I-population. This corresponds to analyzing the sign of the effective self-coupling term. The dynamics of a small perturbation $\\delta r_E$ about a steady state are governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\delta r_E)}{dt} = - \\delta r_E + g_E w_{EE} \\delta r_E = (g_E w_{EE} - 1) \\delta r_E\n$$\nThis subnetwork is unstable if the coefficient $(g_E w_{EE} - 1)$ is positive, i.e., if $g_E w_{EE}  1$.\nLet's compute this value using the given parameters:\n$$\ng_E w_{EE} = (2) \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) = \\frac{6}{5}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{6}{5}  1$, the excitatory-only subnetwork is unstable.\n\nBoth conditions for an ISN are met. Therefore, the network is in an ISN regime. The ISN flag is $\\mathcal{F} = 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Steady-State Linear Response**\nWe need to find the change in the steady-state firing rates, $\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta r_E \\\\ \\Delta r_I \\end{pmatrix}$, in response to a small constant perturbation $\\Delta\\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix}$.\nAt steady state, $\\frac{d\\mathbf{r}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$. The governing equation for the steady-state rate vector $\\mathbf{r}_{ss}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = (GW - I)\\mathbf{r}_{ss} + G\\mathbf{I}_{ext}\n$$\nWhen the input is perturbed by $\\Delta\\mathbf{I}$, the rate vector changes by $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$. The new steady state satisfies:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = (GW - I)(\\mathbf{r}_{ss} + \\Delta\\mathbf{r}) + G(\\mathbf{I}_{ext} + \\Delta\\mathbf{I})\n$$\nExpanding this expression gives:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = \\underbrace{[(GW - I)\\mathbf{r}_{ss} + G\\mathbf{I}_{ext}]}_{\\mathbf{0}} + (GW - I)\\Delta\\mathbf{r} + G\\Delta\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nThe first term is zero by the original steady-state condition. This leaves the linear response equation:\n$$\n(GW - I)\\Delta\\mathbf{r} + G\\Delta\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{0} \\quad \\implies \\quad (I - GW)\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = G\\Delta\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nThe matrix $I-GW$ is simply $-J$:\n$$\nI - GW = -J = -\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{5}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{11}{5} \\\\ -\\frac{3}{2}  \\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe need to solve for $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = (I - GW)^{-1} G \\Delta\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nThe perturbation term $G\\Delta\\mathbf{I}$ is:\n$$\nG\\Delta\\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse of $(I-GW)$ is:\n$$\n(I-GW)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Det}(I-GW)} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\text{Det}(I-GW) = \\text{Det}(-J) = (-1)^2 \\text{Det}(J) = 3$.\n$$\n(I-GW)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute $\\Delta\\mathbf{r}$:\n$$\n\\Delta\\mathbf{r} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{11}{5} \\\\ \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ u \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{11}{5}u \\\\ -\\frac{1}{5}u \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{11}{15}u \\\\ -\\frac{1}{15}u \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, we have $\\Delta r_E = -\\frac{11}{15}u$ and $\\Delta r_I = -\\frac{1}{15}u$. The response magnitudes are defined as $\\alpha_E = \\Delta r_E/u$ and $\\alpha_I = \\Delta r_I/u$:\n$$\n\\alpha_E = \\frac{-\\frac{11}{15}u}{u} = -\\frac{11}{15}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_I = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{15}u}{u} = -\\frac{1}{15}\n$$\nThe negative response of the inhibitory population ($\\alpha_I  0$) to its own excitatory input is a characteristic \"paradoxical\" feature of ISNs, which provides a consistency check for our result.\n\nThe final answer is composed of the ISN flag $\\mathcal{F}$, and the response magnitudes $\\alpha_E$ and $\\alpha_I$.\n$\\mathcal{F} = 1$, $\\alpha_E = -\\frac{11}{15}$, $\\alpha_I = -\\frac{1}{15}$.",
