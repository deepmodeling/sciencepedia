            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the sensitivity of the inhibitory population's steady-state firing rate, $r_I^{\\ast}$, to its own external input, $I_I$. This sensitivity is the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I}$. The derivation must be based on first principles, specifically by linearizing the provided steady-state equations around the fixed point $(r_E^{\\ast}, r_I^{\\ast})$ via implicit differentiation.\n\nThe steady-state firing rates are defined by the fixed-point equations:\n$$\nr_E = \\phi_E(w_{EE}\\,r_E - w_{EI}\\,r_I + I_E) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\nr_I = \\phi_I(w_{IE}\\,r_E - w_{II}\\,r_I + I_I) \\quad (2)\n$$\nAt the stable fixed point $(r_E^{\\ast}, r_I^{\\ast})$, these equations hold. We can consider $r_E^{\\ast}$ and $r_I^{\\ast}$ as implicit functions of the external inputs $I_E$ and $I_I$. To find $\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I}$, we differentiate both equations with respect to $I_I$, holding $I_E$ constant. At the fixed point, the derivatives of the transfer functions are denoted by $g_E$ and $g_I$.\n\nFirst, we differentiate equation $(1)$ with respect to $I_I$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_I} \\left[ \\phi_E(w_{EE}\\,r_E - w_{EI}\\,r_I + I_E) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule to the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} = \\phi_E'(w_{EE}\\,r_E - w_{EI}\\,r_I + I_E) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_I}(w_{EE}\\,r_E - w_{EI}\\,r_I + I_E)\n$$\nSubstituting the given definition $g_E = \\phi_E'(\\cdot)$ and evaluating the inner derivative (noting that $\\frac{\\partial I_E}{\\partial I_I} = 0$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} = g_E \\left( w_{EE}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} - w_{EI}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging this equation to group terms involving $\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I}$ and $\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} - g_E\\,w_{EE}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} = -g_E\\,w_{EI}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}\n$$\n$$\n(1 - g_E\\,w_{EE})\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} + g_E\\,w_{EI}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\nNext, we differentiate equation $(2)$ with respect to $I_I$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_I} \\left[ \\phi_I(w_{IE}\\,r_E - w_{II}\\,r_I + I_I) \\right]\n$$\nApplying the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = \\phi_I'(w_{IE}\\,r_E - w_{II}\\,r_I + I_I) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial I_I}(w_{IE}\\,r_E - w_{II}\\,r_I + I_I)\n$$\nSubstituting the definition $g_I = \\phi_I'(\\cdot)$ and evaluating the inner derivative (noting that $\\frac{\\partial I_I}{\\partial I_I} = 1$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = g_I \\left( w_{IE}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} - w_{II}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} + 1 \\right)\n$$\nRearranging this equation to group terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = g_I\\,w_{IE}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} - g_I\\,w_{II}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} + g_I\n$$\n$$\n-g_I\\,w_{IE}\\,\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} + (1 + g_I\\,w_{II})\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I} = g_I \\quad (4)\n$$\nEquations $(3)$ and $(4)$ form a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I}$ and $\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}$. We can write this system in matrix form:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - g_E\\,w_{EE} & g_E\\,w_{EI} \\\\\n-g_I\\,w_{IE} & 1 + g_I\\,w_{II}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\partial r_E}{\\partial I_I} \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\ng_I\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe wish to solve for $\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}$. Using Cramer's rule, the solution is the ratio of two determinants. The denominator is the determinant of the coefficient matrix, which we denote as $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - g_E\\,w_{EE} & g_E\\,w_{EI} \\\\\n-g_I\\,w_{IE} & 1 + g_I\\,w_{II}\n\\end{pmatrix} = (1 - g_E\\,w_{EE})(1 + g_I\\,w_{II}) + g_E\\,g_I\\,w_{EI}\\,w_{IE}\n$$\nThe numerator is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the second column with the constant vector:\n$$\n\\Delta_I = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 - g_E\\,w_{EE} & 0 \\\\\n-g_I\\,w_{IE} & g_I\n\\end{pmatrix} = (1 - g_E\\,w_{EE}) g_I\n$$\nThe solution for $\\frac{\\partial r_I}{\\partial I_I}$ is then $\\frac{\\Delta_I}{\\Delta}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I} = \\frac{g_I (1 - g_E w_{EE})}{(1 - g_E w_{EE})(1 + g_I w_{II}) + g_E g_I w_{EI} w_{IE}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nNow, we analyze the sign of this expression. The problem states that the fixed point is stable. The stability of the network dynamics is determined by the eigenvalues of the system's Jacobian matrix. The determinant of this Jacobian is proportional to the denominator $\\Delta$. A necessary condition for stability is that this determinant must be positive. Therefore, the stability assumption implies $\\Delta > 0$. Given this, the sign of $\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I}$ is determined solely by the sign of its numerator, $g_I (1 - g_E w_{EE})$. Since $g_I > 0$ is given, the sign depends on the term $(1 - g_E w_{EE})$.\n\nCase 1: Non-ISN regime ($g_E\\,w_{EE} < 1$).\nIn this regime, the excitatory subnetwork is intrinsically stable. The condition $g_E\\,w_{EE} < 1$ implies that $(1 - g_E w_{EE}) > 0$.\nThe numerator is positive, and the denominator is positive. Thus,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I} > 0\n$$\nExplanation: In this regime, an increase in the external drive $I_I$ to the inhibitory population leads to an increase in its firing rate $r_I$. This is the intuitive result. The direct excitatory effect of $I_I$ on the I-population dominates the network's feedback effects. The feedback loop is as follows: an increase in $r_I$ inhibits the E-population, reducing $r_E$. This reduction in $r_E$ lessens the excitation onto the I-population, which opposes the initial rise in $r_I$. However, because the excitatory recurrence is weak ($g_E w_{EE} < 1$), this indirect negative feedback pathway is not strong enough to overcome the direct drive, and the net effect is an increase in $r_I$.\n\nCase 2: Inhibitory Stabilized Network (ISN) regime ($g_E\\,w_{EE} > 1$).\nIn this regime, the excitatory subnetwork on its own is unstable; its activity would grow uncontrollably without inhibitory feedback. The condition $g_E\\,w_{EE} > 1$ implies that $(1 - g_E w_{EE}) < 0$.\nThe numerator is now negative, while the denominator remains positive due to overall network stability. Thus,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial r_I^{\\ast}}{\\partial I_I} < 0\n$$\nExplanation: This is a hallmark paradoxical effect of ISNs. An increase in the external drive $I_I$ to the inhibitory population leads to a net decrease in its steady-state firing rate $r_I$. The mechanism is as follows: A small increase in $I_I$ causes a momentary increase in $r_I$. This increased inhibition powerfully suppresses the highly recurrent excitatory population, causing a significant drop in $r_E$. The condition $g_E w_{EE} > 1$ signifies that the E-population is in a high-gain, amplifying state, so a small amount of extra inhibition from the I-cells causes a large reduction in E-cell activity. This large drop in $r_E$ results in a substantial withdrawal of excitatory drive ($w_{IE}r_E$) from the I-population. This withdrawal of excitation is so strong that it overwhelms the initial direct increase from $I_I$, leading to a net decrease in the total input to the I-population and thus a decrease in its firing rate $r_I$. The stability of the network is maintained by the strong, fast-acting inhibitory feedback, but this gives rise to counter-intuitive responses to external inputs.",

Substituting this into the determinant expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J) = \\left( \\frac{1 + w_{II}g_{I}}{\\tau_{I}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{-1 - w_{II}g_{I}}{\\tau_{I}} \\right) + \\frac{w_{EI}w_{IE}g_{E}g_{I}}{\\tau_{E}\\tau_{I}}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Det}(J) = -\\frac{(1 + w_{II}g_{I})^2}{\\tau_{I}^2} + \\frac{w_{EI}w_{IE}g_{E}g_{I}}{\\tau_{E}\\tau_{I}}\n$$\nFor $\\mathrm{Det}(J) > 0$, the following intermediate condition on the circuit parameters must be satisfied:\n$$\n\\frac{w_{EI}w_{IE}g_{E}g_{I}}{\\tau_{E}\\tau_{I}} > \\frac{(1 + w_{II}g_{I})^2}{\\tau_{I}^2} \\implies w_{EI}w_{IE}g_{E}g_{I} > \\frac{\\tau_{E}}{\\tau_{I}}(1 + w_{II}g_{I})^2\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the eigenvalues are indeed a purely imaginary pair at the bifurcation point, leading to oscillations rather than a simple change in stability without oscillation (which would happen if $\\mathrm{Det}(J) \\leq 0$).\n\nRegarding the additional queries: a two-dimensional smooth continuous-time dynamical system, such as the one described, cannot exhibit deterministic chaos. This is a direct consequence of the Poincaré–Bendixson theorem. The theorem states that for a $2\\mathrm{D}$ system, any trajectory that remains in a closed and bounded subset of the plane which contains no fixed points must asymptotically approach a periodic orbit (a limit cycle). Chaotic trajectories are bounded but aperiodic and do not approach any fixed point or periodic orbit. In a $2\\mathrm{D}$ phase space, solution trajectories cannot cross (due to uniqueness), so a non-periodic, bounded trajectory cannot exist without eventually intersecting itself. Therefore, the most complex behavior this model can generate is a stable limit cycle oscillation. To admit chaotic dynamics, the system's state space must be at least three-dimensional. A canonical microcircuit element that could achieve this would be the addition of a third state variable, such as a second, distinct inhibitory population (e.g., somatostatin-positive interneurons interacting with the first inhibitory population of parvalbumin-positive neurons) or an activity-dependent adaptation mechanism (e.g., spike-frequency adaptation), which introduces its own first-order dynamics, increasing the system dimension to three.\n\nThe derived bifurcation boundary, $w_{EE}^{\\mathrm{H}}$, separates two functionally distinct regimes of the cortical microcircuit. For $w_{EE} < w_{EE}^{\\mathrm{H}}$, the trace of the Jacobian is negative, and the fixed point is stable. The network settles to a constant firing rate in response to constant inputs $I_E$ and $I_I$. This regime supports static computations, such as those seen in winner-take-all networks where a circuit selects a single representation among competitors and holds it as a steady state. For $w_{EE} > w_{EE}^{\\mathrm{H}}$, the trace becomes positive, the fixed point becomes unstable, and a stable limit cycle emerges. The network generates spontaneous, rhythmic oscillations where the excitatory and inhibitory populations fire in a coordinated, periodic fashion. This oscillatory regime is a canonical model for generating brain rhythms, such as gamma oscillations, which are crucial for temporal coding, communication between brain areas, and sensory processing. The parameter $w_{EE}$ represents the strength of recurrent excitation, and the analysis shows that sufficient positive feedback can destabilize a static state and push the E-I circuit into a dynamic, oscillatory mode of operation.",
