This practice uses a two-population firing-rate model to represent the interaction between excitatory ($E$) and somatostatin-expressing ($S$) neurons under the influence of VIP interneuron input. By deriving the nullclines and solving for the circuit's fixed point, you will gain hands-on experience with phase-plane analysis and see precisely how disinhibitory signals control the steady-state activity of a cortical microcircuit .",

It asks for the derivation of the nullclines and the fixed point of this system.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Nullclines**\n\nA nullcline for a given variable is the set of points in the phase space where the time derivative of that variable is equal to zero. The phase space for this system is the $(E,S)$-plane.\n\n**The $E$-nullcline:**\nThe $E$-nullcline is defined by the condition $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$. Setting the first equation to zero, we get:\n$$ 0 = -E + w_{EE}\\,E - w_{ES}\\,S + I_{E} $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express $S$ as a function of $E$, which defines the nullcline as a line in the $(E,S)$-plane.\n$$ w_{ES}\\,S = (w_{EE} - 1)E + I_{E} $$\nAssuming $w_{ES} > 0$ (as inhibition must be present for the term to be meaningful), the equation for the $E$-nullcline is:\n$$ S = \\frac{w_{EE}-1}{w_{ES}}E + \\frac{I_{E}}{w_{ES}} $$\nThis is a linear equation in $E$ and $S$.\n\n**The $S$-nullcline:**\nThe $S$-nullcline is defined by the condition $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$. Setting the second equation to zero, we have:\n$$ 0 = -S + w_{SE}\\,E - w_{SS}\\,S - k_{V}\\,A + I_{S} $$\nAgain, we rearrange to express $S$ as a function of $E$:\n$$ S + w_{SS}\\,S = w_{SE}\\,E - k_{V}\\,A + I_{S} $$\n$$ (1 + w_{SS})S = w_{SE}\\,E + (I_{S} - k_{V}\\,A) $$\nSince $w_{SS} \\ge 0$, the term $(1+w_{SS})$ is strictly positive. Thus, the equation for the $S$-nullcline is:\n$$ S = \\frac{w_{SE}}{1+w_{SS}}E + \\frac{I_{S} - k_{V}\\,A}{1+w_{SS}} $$\nThis is also a linear equation in $E$ and $S$. Notably, the vertical intercept of this line depends on the input amplitude $A$.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Fixed Point**\n\nThe fixed point of the system, denoted $(E^{\\ast}(A), S^{\\ast}(A))$, is the point of intersection of the $E$-nullcline and the $S$-nullcline. At this point, both derivatives are simultaneously zero, i.e., $\\frac{dE}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$. We must solve the following system of linear algebraic equations for $E$ and $S$:\n$$ (w_{EE}-1)E - w_{ES}S = -I_E \\quad \\quad (1) $$\n$$ w_{SE}E - (1+w_{SS})S = k_V A - I_S \\quad \\quad (2) $$\nTo facilitate solving, we can rewrite the system in a standard form:\n$$ (1-w_{EE})E + w_{ES}S = I_E $$\n$$ -w_{SE}E + (1+w_{SS})S = I_S - k_V A $$\nThis is a $2 \\times 2$ linear system. We can solve for $E^{\\ast}$ and $S^{\\ast}$ using various methods, such as substitution or Cramer's rule. Let's use Cramer's rule for a systematic solution. The system in matrix form is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 1-w_{EE} & w_{ES} \\\\ -w_{SE} & 1+w_{SS} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} E \\\\ S \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} I_E \\\\ I_S - k_V A \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of the coefficient matrix, let's call it $\\Delta$, is:\n$$ \\Delta = \\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-w_{EE} & w_{ES} \\\\ -w_{SE} & 1+w_{SS} \\end{pmatrix} = (1-w_{EE})(1+w_{SS}) - (w_{ES})(-w_{SE}) $$\n$$ \\Delta = (1-w_{EE})(1+w_{SS}) + w_{ES}w_{SE} $$\nThe problem statement guarantees that a unique fixed point exists, which implies that $\\Delta \\neq 0$.\n\nNow we find the coordinate $E^{\\ast}(A)$:\n$$ E^{\\ast}(A) = \\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} I_E & w_{ES} \\\\ I_S - k_V A & 1+w_{SS} \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{I_E(1+w_{SS}) - w_{ES}(I_S - k_V A)}{\\Delta} $$\n$$ E^{\\ast}(A) = \\frac{(1+w_{SS})I_E - w_{ES}I_S + w_{ES}k_V A}{(1-w_{EE})(1+w_{SS}) + w_{ES}w_{SE}} $$\nNext, we find the coordinate $S^{\\ast}(A)$:\n$$ S^{\\ast}(A) = \\frac{\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-w_{EE} & I_E \\\\ -w_{SE} & I_S - k_V A \\end{pmatrix}}{\\Delta} = \\frac{(1-w_{EE})(I_S - k_V A) - I_E(-w_{SE})}{\\Delta} $$\n$$ S^{\\ast}(A) = \\frac{(1-w_{EE})(I_S - k_V A) + w_{SE}I_E}{(1-w_{EE})(1+w_{SS}) + w_{ES}w_{SE}} $$\nThese expressions give the coordinates of the unique intersection $(E^{\\ast}(A), S^{\\ast}(A))$ as closed-form analytic functions of the VIP input amplitude $A$ and the model parameters.",

The problem is neither trivial nor tautological, requiring a correct application of differential calculus in a specific scientific context.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe objective is to compute the sensitivity $S$, defined as the derivative of the firing-rate modulation $\\Delta r$ with respect to the $\\text{GABA}_\\text{A}$ reversal potential $E_{\\text{GABA}}$.\nThe firing-rate modulation is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta r = r'\\,\\Delta I_{\\text{eq}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the equivalent current $\\Delta I_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta r = r' \\left(E_{\\text{GABA}} - V^{*}\\right) \\Delta g_{I}\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta r$ depends on $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ through two terms: the explicit appearance of $E_{\\text{GABA}}$ and the implicit dependence through the steady-state operating voltage $V^{*}$. To find the sensitivity $S$, we differentiate $\\Delta r$ with respect to $E_{\\text{GABA}}$. The terms $r'$ and $\\Delta g_{I}$ are treated as constants for this operation, as per the problem statement.\nApplying the rules of differentiation:\n$$\nS = \\frac{d(\\Delta r)}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}} = \\frac{d}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}} \\left[ r' \\left(E_{\\text{GABA}} - V^{*}\\right) \\Delta g_{I} \\right]\n$$\n$$\nS = r' \\Delta g_{I} \\frac{d}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}} \\left( E_{\\text{GABA}} - V^{*} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the linearity of the derivative, we get:\n$$\nS = r' \\Delta g_{I} \\left(\\frac{dE_{\\text{GABA}}}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}} - \\frac{dV^{*}}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}}\\right) = r' \\Delta g_{I} \\left(1 - \\frac{dV^{*}}{dE_{\\text{GABA}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe next step is to calculate the derivative of the steady-state voltage $V^{*}$ with respect to $E_{\\text{GABA}}$.

The expression for $V^{*}$ is a linear function of $E_{\\text{GABA}}$.

The process is a Wiener process with drift $\\mu$ and diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$.\n\nFor a process $dX_t = \\mu dt + \\sigma dW_t$ starting at $X_0 = 0$, the first-passage time $T$ to a threshold $\\theta > 0$ follows an inverse Gaussian distribution. The fundamental properties of this distribution provide its moments. The first two moments, the mean $E[T]$ and variance $\\text{Var}(T)$, are given by well-known expressions from renewal theory:\n$$\nE[T] = \\frac{\\theta}{\\mu}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}(T) = \\frac{\\theta \\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}\n$$\nThese formulas are valid for a positive drift, $\\mu > 0$, which is satisfied in this problem since $\\mu(\\delta) = \\mu_0(1+\\alpha\\delta)$ with $\\mu_0 > 0$, $\\alpha > 0$, and $\\delta \\ge 0$.\n\nThe coefficient of variation (CV) of the ISI is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\n\\text{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(T)}}{E[T]}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mean and variance:\n$$\n\\text{CV} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta \\sigma^2}{\\mu^3}}}{\\frac{\\theta}{\\mu}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma\\sqrt{\\theta}}{\\mu^{3/2}}}{\\frac{\\theta}{\\mu}} = \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\theta}}{\\mu^{3/2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\mu}{\\theta} = \\frac{\\sigma \\sqrt{\\theta} \\mu}{\\mu^{3/2} \\theta} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu^{1/2} \\theta^{1/2}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\mu \\theta}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the CV as a function of the model parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and $\\theta$.\n\nNow, we introduce the dependence on the disinhibition parameter $\\delta$. The drift $\\mu$ and diffusion $\\sigma$ are given as:\n$$\n\\mu(\\delta) = \\mu_0 (1 + \\alpha \\delta)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(\\delta) = \\sigma_0 (1 + \\beta \\delta)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the CV, we obtain the CV as a function of $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\text{CV}(\\delta) = \\frac{\\sigma_0 (1 + \\beta \\delta)}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 (1 + \\alpha \\delta) \\theta}} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\theta}} \\cdot \\frac{1 + \\beta \\delta}{\\sqrt{1 + \\alpha \\delta}}\n$$\nLet's denote the baseline CV (at $\\delta=0$) as $C_0 = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\theta}}$. Then the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{CV}(\\delta) = C_0 (1 + \\beta \\delta) (1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-1/2}\n$$\nTo find the rate of change of the CV with respect to $\\delta$, we need to compute the derivative $\\frac{d}{d\\delta}\\text{CV}(\\delta)$. We use the product rule and chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d\\delta}\\text{CV}(\\delta) = C_0 \\left[ \\frac{d}{d\\delta}(1 + \\beta \\delta) \\cdot (1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-1/2} + (1 + \\beta \\delta) \\cdot \\frac{d}{d\\delta}(1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-1/2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= C_0 \\left[ \\beta (1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-1/2} + (1 + \\beta \\delta) \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-3/2} \\cdot \\alpha \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= C_0 \\left[ \\beta (1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-1/2} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} (1 + \\beta \\delta) (1 + \\alpha \\delta)^{-3/2} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem asks for this derivative evaluated at $\\delta=0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\text{CV}}{d\\delta} \\right|_{\\delta=0} = C_0 \\left[ \\beta (1 + 0)^{-1/2} - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} (1 + 0) (1 + 0)^{-3/2} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= C_0 \\left[ \\beta \\cdot 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 \\right] = C_0 \\left( \\beta - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_0$ back in:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\text{CV}}{d\\delta} \\right|_{\\delta=0} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\theta}} \\left( \\beta - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} \\right)\n$$\nNow we can plug in the given numerical values:\n$\\mu_0 = 0.2$\n$\\sigma_0 = 0.08$\n$\\theta = 0.02$\n$\\alpha = 0.6$\n$\\beta = 0.4$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms inside the expression:\n$$\n\\mu_0 \\theta = 0.2 \\times 0.02 = 0.004\n$$\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\mu_0 \\theta} = \\sqrt{0.004}\n$$\n$$\n\\beta - \\frac{\\alpha}{2} = 0.4 - \\frac{0.6}{2} = 0.4 - 0.3 = 0.1\n$$\nNow, substitute these into the derivative expression:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\text{CV}}{d\\delta} \\right|_{\\delta=0} = \\frac{0.08}{\\sqrt{0.004}} (0.1) = \\frac{0.008}{\\sqrt{0.004}}\n$$\nLet's compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\sqrt{0.004} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 10^{-3}} = 2 \\times 10^{-3/2} = 2 \\times (\\sqrt{1000})^{-1} = \\frac{2}{10\\sqrt{10}} = \\frac{1}{5\\sqrt{10}}\n$$\nUsing a calculator, $\\sqrt{0.004} \\approx 0.06324555...$\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{d\\text{CV}}{d\\delta} \\right|_{\\delta=0} \\approx \\frac{0.008}{0.06324555...} \\approx 0.1264911...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n0.1264911... \\approx 0.1265\n$$\nThus, the derivative of the coefficient of variation with respect to the disinhibition parameter at $\\delta = 0$ is approximately $0.1265$.",
