            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the canonical theta neuron model and the standard mathematical framework of phase reduction, which are core topics in computational neuroscience. The givens are complete and consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful derivation. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the infinitesimal Phase Response Curve (PRC), denoted as $Z(\\theta)$, for the theta neuron model. The dynamics of a general one-dimensional oscillator perturbed by a small external input can be written as:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = F(\\theta) + \\epsilon g(\\theta) u(t)\n$$\nIn our case, the unperturbed dynamics are given by $F(\\theta) = 1 - \\cos\\theta + (1+\\cos\\theta)I$, and the perturbation term is derived from the perturbed dynamics $\\dot{\\theta} = 1 - \\cos\\theta + (1+\\cos\\theta) \\big(I + \\epsilon u(t)\\big)$. Expanding this, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{\\theta} = \\big[1 - \\cos\\theta + (1+\\cos\\theta)I\\big] + \\epsilon (1+\\cos\\theta) u(t)\n$$\nThus, we identify a perturbation of the form $g(\\theta) = 1+\\cos\\theta$.\n\nThe asymptotic phase $\\phi$ is defined such that it advances linearly in time for the unperturbed system, i.e., $\\dot{\\phi} = \\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the constant natural angular frequency of the oscillator. The phase $\\phi$ is a function of the state variable $\\theta$, so we can write $\\phi = \\Phi(\\theta)$. The relationship between the rates of change is $\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\theta} \\dot{\\theta}$. For the unperturbed system, this gives $\\omega = \\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\theta} F(\\theta)$, which implies:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{\\omega}{F(\\theta)}\n$$\nFor the perturbed system, the phase dynamics are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\phi} = \\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\theta} \\dot{\\theta} = \\frac{\\omega}{F(\\theta)} \\big[F(\\theta) + \\epsilon g(\\theta) u(t)\\big] = \\omega + \\epsilon \\frac{\\omega g(\\theta)}{F(\\theta)} u(t)\n$$\nComparing this to the canonical form of the reduced phase dynamics, $\\dot{\\phi} = \\omega + \\epsilon Z(\\phi) u(t)$, we identify the PRC, expressed as a function of the original coordinate $\\theta$, as:\n$$\nZ(\\theta) = \\frac{\\omega g(\\theta)}{F(\\theta)}\n$$\nTo find the explicit form of $Z(\\theta)$, we first need to calculate the natural frequency $\\omega$. The period of oscillation, $T_0$, is the time taken for $\\theta$ to evolve from $0$ to $2\\pi$. It is given by the integral:\n$$\nT_0 = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\dot{\\theta}} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{F(\\theta)} = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\frac{d\\theta}{1 - \\cos\\theta + (1+\\cos\\theta)I}\n$$\nThis integral is best solved using the Weierstrass substitution, $t = \\tan(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$. With this substitution, we have $\\cos\\theta = \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}$ and $d\\theta = \\frac{2 dt}{1+t^2}$. As $\\theta$ goes from $0$ to $2\\pi$, $t$ goes from $0$ to $\\infty$ (as $\\theta \\to \\pi^-$) and then from $-\\infty$ (as $\\theta \\to \\pi^+$) to $0$. Thus, the integral is over the entire real line from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$.\nThe denominator becomes:\n$$\nF(\\theta(t)) = 1 - \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} + I \\left(1 + \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\\right) = \\frac{1+t^2-(1-t^2)}{1+t^2} + I \\frac{1+t^2+1-t^2}{1+t^2} = \\frac{2t^2}{1+t^2} + \\frac{2I}{1+t^2} = \\frac{2(t^2+I)}{1+t^2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $T_0$:\n$$\nT_0 = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1+t^2}{2(t^2+I)} \\left(\\frac{2 dt}{1+t^2}\\right) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{dt}{t^2+I}\n$$\nSince the problem states $I > 0$, we can evaluate this standard integral:\n$$\nT_0 = \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{I}} \\arctan\\left(\\frac{t}{\\sqrt{I}}\\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{I}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{I}}\n$$\nThe natural angular frequency is $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_0}$.\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi/\\sqrt{I}} = 2\\sqrt{I}\n$$\nNow we can assemble the expression for the PRC, $Z(\\theta)$. We have $\\omega = 2\\sqrt{I}$, $g(\\theta) = 1+\\cos\\theta$, and $F(\\theta) = 1 - \\cos\\theta + I(1+\\cos\\theta)$.\n$$\nZ(\\theta) = \\frac{(2\\sqrt{I})(1+\\cos\\theta)}{1 - \\cos\\theta + I(1+\\cos\\theta)}\n$$\nThis expression can be slightly rearranged by collecting terms in the denominator: $F(\\theta) = (1+I) + (I-1)\\cos\\theta$.\nThe final expression for the PRC is:\n$$\nZ(\\theta) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{I} (1+\\cos\\theta)}{(1+I) + (I-1)\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThe second part of the problem is to prove that $Z(\\theta)$ is positive for all phases, except possibly at isolated points, for $I > 0$.\nThe expression for $Z(\\theta)$ is a ratio. Let's analyze the sign of the numerator and the denominator.\n1.  The factor $2\\sqrt{I}$ is strictly positive since $I>0$.\n2.  The factor $1+\\cos\\theta$ is non-negative, since $\\cos\\theta \\in [-1, 1]$. It is equal to $0$ only when $\\cos\\theta = -1$, which occurs at the isolated point $\\theta=\\pi$ in the interval $[0, 2\\pi)$. At all other points, $1+\\cos\\theta > 0$.\n3.  The denominator is $F(\\theta) = \\dot{\\theta}$, the instantaneous angular velocity of the unperturbed oscillator. For the system to have a stable limit cycle, as is necessary for the PRC to be well-defined, $\\dot{\\theta}$ must be non-zero along the entire cycle. Fixed points of the flow occur where $F(\\theta)=0$. Let's check for fixed points:\n    $$\n    1 - \\cos\\theta + I(1+\\cos\\theta) = 0 \\implies (1+I) = (1-I)\\cos\\theta \\implies \\cos\\theta = \\frac{1+I}{1-I}\n    $$\n    Since $I>0$, we analyze the magnitude of this expression. If $0<I<1$, then $1+I > 1-I > 0$, so $\\frac{1+I}{1-I} > 1$. If $I>1$, then $1-I < 0$ and $1+I > 0$, so $\\frac{1+I}{1-I} < -1$. If $I=1$, the equation becomes $2 = 0$, which is impossible. In all cases for $I>0$, the value of $\\frac{1+I}{1-I}$ is outside the range $[-1, 1]$ of the cosine function. Therefore, there are no real solutions for $\\theta$, which means there are no fixed points.\n    Since $F(\\theta)$ is a continuous function of $\\theta$ and is never zero, it must have a constant sign. We can determine this sign by evaluating $F(\\theta)$ at any point, for example $\\theta=0$:\n    $$\n    F(0) = 1 - \\cos(0) + I(1+\\cos(0)) = 1-1+I(1+1) = 2I\n    $$\n    Since $I>0$, $F(0) > 0$. Therefore, $F(\\theta) > 0$ for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$.\n\nCombining these observations, $Z(\\theta)$ is a product and ratio of terms:\n$$\nZ(\\theta) = \\frac{(\\text{positive}) \\times (\\text{non-negative})}{(\\text{positive})}\n$$\nThis implies that $Z(\\theta) \\ge 0$. The equality to zero occurs only when the numerator term $1+\\cos\\theta = 0$, which is at $\\theta=\\pi$. For all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ such that $\\theta \\neq \\pi$, we have $Z(\\theta) > 0$. This proves that the PRC is positive for all phases except at an isolated point, which is a defining characteristic of Type I excitability.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for $Z(\\theta)$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a standard, well-posed problem in the mathematical theory of coupled oscillators and computational neuroscience. It is scientifically grounded, formally specified, and contains no contradictions or ambiguities.

The evolution from $\\phi_n$ to $\\phi_{n+1}$ occurs in two steps: a discontinuous jump due to the pulse at $t=nT$, followed by continuous evolution between pulses.\n\n1.  **Phase jump across the pulse at $t = nT$:**\n    To find the change in phase due to the delta-function pulse, we integrate the evolution equation over an infinitesimal interval $[nT^-, nT^+]$ around the time of the pulse:\n    $$\n    \\int_{nT^-}^{nT^+} \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} dt = \\int_{nT^-}^{nT^+} \\left( \\omega + \\varepsilon Z(\\theta(t)) g \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} \\delta(t-kT) \\right) dt\n    $$\n    The left-hand side is the net phase change across the pulse: $\\theta(nT^+) - \\theta(nT^-) = \\theta(nT^+) - \\phi_n$.\n    The right-hand side becomes:\n    $$\n    \\int_{nT^-}^{nT^+} \\omega dt + \\varepsilon g \\int_{nT^-}^{nT^+} Z(\\theta(t)) \\delta(t-nT) dt\n    $$\n    The first term $\\int_{nT^-}^{nT^+} \\omega dt$ vanishes as the integration interval shrinks to zero. The second integral, by the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, evaluates to $\\varepsilon g Z(\\theta(nT))$. Since the phase $\\theta(t)$ itself does not jump instantaneously, we can use $\\theta(nT) = \\theta(nT^-) = \\phi_n$.\n    Thus, the phase jump is $\\theta(nT^+) - \\phi_n = \\varepsilon g Z(\\phi_n)$.

At the critical value $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_c$, we have $|\\sin(\\phi^* + \\psi)| = 1$. This implies $\\cos(\\phi^* + \\psi) = 0$.\nThe stability multiplier at this point is $F'(\\phi^*) = 1 + \\varepsilon g Z'(\\phi^*) = 1 + \\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^* + \\psi) = 1 + 0 = 1$.\nThis corresponds to a saddle-node bifurcation, where a pair of fixed points (one stable, one unstable) is created.\n\nFor any $\\varepsilon > \\varepsilon_c$, we have $|\\sin(\\phi^* + \\psi)| < 1$. Two distinct fixed points $\\phi_1^*$ and $\\phi_2^*$ will exist. For these fixed points, $\\cos(\\phi^* + \\psi) \\ne 0$. Specifically, if $\\sin(\\phi_1^*+\\psi)=\\sin(\\phi_2^*+\\psi)$, then $\\cos(\\phi_1^*+\\psi) = -\\cos(\\phi_2^*+\\psi)$. Let's analyze the stability condition, $-2 < \\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*) < 0$.\nThe term $\\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*)$ must be negative. Since the two fixed points have opposite signs for their cosine term, we can always choose the fixed point that satisfies $\\text{sgn}(g) \\ne \\text{sgn}(\\cos(\\phi^* + \\psi))$ to make the product $g \\cos(\\phi^* + \\psi)$ negative. For this stable branch, the term $\\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*)$ will be negative.\n\nThe other part of the stability condition is $-2 < \\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*+\\psi)$. For the stable branch, we have shown $\\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*+\\psi) = -|\\varepsilon g \\alpha \\cos(\\phi^*+\\psi)| = -|\\varepsilon g \\alpha| \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2(\\phi^*+\\psi)}$. Using the fixed point condition, this is $-|\\varepsilon g \\alpha| \\sqrt{1 - (-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\varepsilon g \\alpha})^2} = -\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon g \\alpha)^2 - \\Delta^2}$.\nThe condition becomes $-2 < -\\sqrt{(\\varepsilon |g| \\alpha)^2 - \\Delta^2}$. This is always satisfied for $\\varepsilon$ just above $\\varepsilon_c$, where the square root term is close to $0$.\n\nSince a stable fixed point comes into existence as soon as $\\varepsilon$ exceeds the critical value $\\varepsilon_c = \\frac{|\\Delta|}{\\alpha|g|}$, this value represents the minimal forcing strength required for the existence of a stable $1{:}1$ locked state.\n\nSubstituting the definition of the detuning, $\\Delta = \\omega T - 2\\pi$, we obtain the final expression for $\\varepsilon_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\min} = \\frac{|\\omega T - 2\\pi|}{\\alpha |g|}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\psi$ does not appear in the final answer as it only represents a phase shift of the PRC, which does not affect the amplitude of the PRC or its derivative, and thus not the existence or stability boundaries for entrainment.",

Given that $H$ is differentiable at $\\phi=0$, we have:\n$$\nH(\\phi) \\approx H(0) + H'(0)\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting this linearization into the perturbation dynamics yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta_i}{dt} \\approx \\frac{K}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\left[ H(0) + H'(0)(\\delta_j - \\delta_i) \\right] - K H(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta_i}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{K}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} H(0)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{K H'(0)}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\delta_j - \\delta_i)\\right) - K H(0)\n$$\nThe first term evaluates to $\\frac{K}{N}(N \\cdot H(0)) = K H(0)$, which cancels with the last term. This leaves the linearized dynamics:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta_i}{dt} = \\frac{K H'(0)}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\delta_j - \\delta_i)\n$$\nWe can rewrite the sum as $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_j - \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_j - N\\delta_i$. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\delta_i}{dt} = \\frac{K H'(0)}{N}\\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_j - N\\delta_i \\right) = K H'(0) \\left( \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\delta_j - \\delta_i \\right)\n$$\nThis is a system of $N$ coupled linear ordinary differential equations for the perturbations $\\delta_i(t)$. To find the eigenvalues, we express the system in matrix form, $\\frac{d\\vec{\\delta}}{dt} = J\\vec{\\delta}$, where $\\vec{\\delta} = (\\delta_1, \\dots, \\delta_N)^T$ and $J$ is the Jacobian matrix. The elements of the Jacobian, $J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\delta_j}(\\frac{d\\delta_i}{dt})$, are:\n$$\nJ_{ij} = K H'(0) \\left( \\frac{1}{N} - \\delta_{ij} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The Jacobian matrix is therefore:\n$$\nJ = K H'(0) \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{N}-1 & \\frac{1}{N} & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{N} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{N} & \\frac{1}{N}-1 & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{N} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\frac{1}{N} & \\frac{1}{N} & \\cdots & \\frac{1}{N}-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix can be compactly written as $J = K H'(0) \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{1} - I\\right)$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the $N \\times N$ matrix of all ones and $I$ is the $N \\times N$ identity matrix.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $J$ determine the stability of the synchronized state. To find them, we first find the eigenvalues of the matrix $M = \\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{1} - I$. The matrix $\\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{1}$ is a rank-1 matrix. It has one eigenvalue equal to $1$, with the corresponding eigenvector being $\\vec{v}_1 = (1, 1, \\dots, 1)^T$. The other $N-1$ eigenvalues are $0$, with the corresponding eigenspace being the $(N-1)$-dimensional subspace of vectors whose components sum to zero (i.e., orthogonal to $\\vec{v}_1$).\n\nThe eigenvalues of $M$ are related to the eigenvalues of $\\frac{1}{N}\\mathbf{1}$ by a shift of $-1$.\nThus, $M$ has one eigenvalue $\\lambda_M = 1 - 1 = 0$.\nThe remaining $N-1$ eigenvalues are $\\lambda_M = 0 - 1 = -1$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of the full Jacobian $J = K H'(0) M$ are therefore:\n1. One eigenvalue $\\lambda_0 = K H'(0) \\cdot 0 = 0$. This eigenvalue corresponds to the eigenvector $(1, 1, \\dots, 1)^T$. A perturbation along this vector, $\\delta_i(t) = c$ for all $i$, represents a uniform shift of the phase of the entire synchronized population. This is the neutrally stable global phase-shift mode, whose existence is guaranteed by the rotational symmetry of the system. The problem statement instructs to exclude this mode from the stability analysis.\n\n2. $N-1$ identical eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\perp} = K H'(0) \\cdot (-1) = -K H'(0)$. These eigenvalues govern the stability of perturbations transverse to the synchronization manifold, i.e., those that desynchronize the oscillators.\n\nThe set of nontrivial eigenvalues consists of $N-1$ identical values equal to $-K H'(0)$. The leading nontrivial eigenvalue (the one with the largest real part) is therefore this value. The problem asks for the real part of this eigenvalue. Since $K$ and $H'(0)$ are real, the eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\perp}$ is real.\nTherefore, the real part of the leading nontrivial eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{\\perp}) = -K H'(0)\n$$\nThe stability of the synchronized state is ensured if $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{\\perp}) < 0$, which implies $K H'(0) > 0$. As $K>0$ is given, this requires $H'(0)>0$.",
