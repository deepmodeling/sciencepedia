            "problem": "A common approach in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) of neural data is to build a simplicial complex from an instantaneous coactivity graph among neurons and then study its homology. Consider a spike-train dataset from $3$ hippocampal neurons $\\{n_1,n_2,n_3\\}$ recorded during exploration. At a fixed coactivity threshold $\\tau$, two neuron pairs exceed the threshold: $\\{n_1,n_2\\}$ and $\\{n_2,n_3\\}$, while $\\{n_1,n_3\\}$ does not. Assume there is no simultaneous triple coactivity above $\\tau$. Construct the flag (clique) complex $K(\\tau)$ from this graph: include a $0$-simplex for each neuron, a $1$-simplex for each observed coactive pair, and a $2$-simplex only if all three edges of a triangle are present. For this $K(\\tau)$, use simplicial homology with coefficients in a field (e.g., $\\mathbb{R}$).\n\nStarting from the core definitions of simplicial complexes, chain groups, and boundary operators, compute the Betti numbers $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ of $K(\\tau)$. Then, explain the topological meaning of these Betti numbers in the context of neural coactivity: interpret what $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$ say about the number of connected neural assemblies and the presence or absence of one-dimensional coactivity loops at threshold $\\tau$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a row matrix using the $\\mathrm{pmatrix}$ environment with entries $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of topological data analysis as applied to computational neuroscience, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution involves three main steps: 1) constructing the simplicial complex based on the provided coactivity data, 2) computing the homology groups and their corresponding Betti numbers, and 3) interpreting these topological invariants in the context of the neural system.\n\n**1. Construction of the Simplicial Complex $K(\\tau)$**\n\nA simplicial complex is a collection of simplices (vertices, edges, triangles, etc.) that is closed under the operation of taking faces. The problem specifies the construction of a flag (or clique) complex, where a simplex is included if and only if all of its sub-simplices (faces) are present.\n\n*   **0-simplices (Vertices):** The vertices of the complex correspond to the individual neurons. We have $3$ neurons, which we denote as $n_1$, $n_2$, and $n_3$. The set of $0$-simplices is $K_0 = \\{[n_1], [n_2], [n_3]\\}$.\n\n*   **1-simplices (Edges):** The edges represent pairs of neurons whose coactivity exceeds the threshold $\\tau$. The problem states that the pairs $\\{n_1, n_2\\}$ and $\\{n_2, n_3\\}$ are coactive, while $\\{n_1, n_3\\}$ is not. Therefore, the set of $1$-simplices is $K_1 = \\{[n_1, n_2], [n_2, n_3]\\}$.\n\n*   **2-simplices (Triangles):** A $2$-simplex, $[n_1, n_2, n_3]$, would be included in the flag complex if and only if all three of its constituent edges ($1$-faces) are in $K_1$. These edges are $[n_1, n_2]$, $[n_2, n_3]$, and $[n_1, n_3]$. Since the edge $[n_1, n_3]$ is not in $K_1$, the $2$-simplex $[n_1, n_2, n_3]$ is not part of the complex. This is also consistent with the given condition of no simultaneous triple coactivity. Thus, the set of $2$-simplices is empty: $K_2 = \\emptyset$.\n\n*   **Higher-dimensional Simplices:** Since there are no $2$-simplices, there can be no simplices of dimension $p \\ge 2$.\n\nThe resulting simplicial complex $K(\\tau)$ consists of three vertices and two edges connecting them in a sequence: $n_1 - n_2 - n_3$. Topologically, this is a line segment.\n\n**2. Computation of Betti Numbers $\\beta_0$ and $\\beta_1$**\n\nWe will use simplicial homology with coefficients in a field $\\mathbb{F}$ (such as $\\mathbb{R}$). The $p$-th Betti number, $\\beta_p$, is the dimension of the $p$-th homology group $H_p(K) = \\ker(\\partial_p) / \\text{im}(\\partial_{p+1})$.\n\nFirst, we define the chain groups $C_p(K)$, which are vector spaces over $\\mathbb{F}$ with bases given by the oriented $p$-simplices.\n\n*   $C_0(K)$: A vector space with basis $\\{[n_1], [n_2], [n_3]\\}$. Its dimension is $\\dim(C_0) = 3$.\n*   $C_1(K)$: A vector space with basis $\\{[n_1, n_2], [n_2, n_3]\\}$. Its dimension is $\\dim(C_1) = 2$.\n*   $C_2(K)$: The trivial vector space $\\{0\\}$ since $K_2$ is empty. Its dimension is $\\dim(C_2) = 0$.\n\nNext, we define the boundary operators $\\partial_p: C_p(K) \\to C_{p-1}(K)$.\n\n*   $\\partial_2: C_2(K) \\to C_1(K)$ is the zero map since $C_2(K)=\\{0\\}$. Thus, $\\text{im}(\\partial_2) = \\{0\\}$.\n*   $\\partial_1: C_1(K) \\to C_0(K)$ is defined by its action on the basis elements:\n    $$ \\partial_1([v_0, v_1]) = [v_1] - [v_0] $$\n    So, for our basis:\n    $$ \\partial_1([n_1, n_2]) = [n_2] - [n_1] $$\n    $$ \\partial_1([n_2, n_3]) = [n_3] - [n_2] $$\n\n**Computation of $\\beta_0$:**\nThe $0$-th Betti number is the dimension of the $0$-th homology group, $H_0(K) = \\ker(\\partial_0) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1)$.\nBy definition, $\\partial_0$ is the zero map, so $\\ker(\\partial_0) = C_0(K)$.\nThus, $H_0(K) = C_0(K) / \\text{im}(\\partial_1)$. The dimension is given by:\n$$ \\beta_0 = \\dim(H_0(K)) = \\dim(C_0(K)) - \\dim(\\text{im}(\\partial_1)) $$\nThe image of $\\partial_1$, $\\text{im}(\\partial_1)$, is the subspace of $C_0(K)$ spanned by the vectors $[n_2] - [n_1]$ and $[n_3] - [n_2]$. These two vectors are linearly independent. For example, if $c_1([n_2] - [n_1]) + c_2([n_3] - [n_2]) = 0$, then $-c_1[n_1] + (c_1-c_2)[n_2] + c_2[n_3] = 0$. Since $\\{[n_1], [n_2], [n_3]\\}$ is a basis, this implies $-c_1=0$, $c_1-c_2=0$, and $c_2=0$, which gives $c_1=c_2=0$.\nThus, $\\dim(\\text{im}(\\partial_1)) = 2$.\nSubstituting the dimensions, we find:\n$$ \\beta_0 = 3 - 2 = 1 $$\n\n**Computation of $\\beta_1$:**\nThe $1$-st Betti number is the dimension of the $1$-st homology group, $H_1(K) = \\ker(\\partial_1) / \\text{im}(\\partial_2)$.\nAs established, $\\text{im}(\\partial_2) = \\{0\\}$. Therefore, $H_1(K) \\cong \\ker(\\partial_1)$. We need to find the dimension of the kernel of $\\partial_1$.\nAn arbitrary element of $C_1(K)$ is a linear combination $c = a_1[n_1, n_2] + a_2[n_2, n_3]$ for scalars $a_1, a_2 \\in \\mathbb{F}$.\nIts boundary is:\n$$ \\partial_1(c) = a_1 \\partial_1([n_1, n_2]) + a_2 \\partial_1([n_2, n_3]) $$\n$$ \\partial_1(c) = a_1([n_2] - [n_1]) + a_2([n_3] - [n_2]) $$\n$$ \\partial_1(c) = -a_1[n_1] + (a_1 - a_2)[n_2] + a_2[n_3] $$\nFor $c$ to be in the kernel of $\\partial_1$, we must have $\\partial_1(c) = 0$. Since $\\{[n_1], [n_2], [n_3]\\}$ forms a basis for $C_0(K)$, the coefficients of the basis vectors must all be zero:\n$$ -a_1 = 0 \\implies a_1 = 0 $$\n$$ a_1 - a_2 = 0 $$\n$$ a_2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting $a_1=0$ and $a_2=0$ into the middle equation confirms consistency. The only solution is $a_1 = 0$ and $a_2 = 0$. This means the only element in the kernel is the zero vector, $c=0$.\nTherefore, $\\ker(\\partial_1) = \\{0\\}$. The dimension of the kernel is $0$.\n$$ \\beta_1 = \\dim(H_1(K)) = \\dim(\\ker(\\partial_1)) = 0 $$\n\nThe Betti numbers for the complex $K(\\tau)$ are $\\beta_0=1$ and $\\beta_1=0$.\n\n**3. Topological Interpretation in the Neural Context**\n\nThe Betti numbers provide a concise, quantitative description of the topology of the coactivity graph.\n\n*   **Interpretation of $\\beta_0 = 1$:** The $0$-th Betti number, $\\beta_0$, counts the number of connected components in the topological space. In this context, the simplicial complex represents the functional connectivity structure of the neural population. A connected component is a maximal subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by a path of edges. Such a component can be interpreted as a \"neural assembly\"—a group of neurons that are functionally integrated through pairwise coactivity, either directly or indirectly. The result $\\beta_0=1$ signifies that at the given threshold $\\tau$, all the neurons with significant coactivity form a single, unified functional network. There are no isolated, independent groups of coactive neurons.\n\n*   **Interpretation of $\\beta_1 = 0$:** The $1$-st Betti number, $\\beta_1$, counts the number of independent one-dimensional \"holes\" or loops in the space. In the coactivity complex, a $1$-cycle (a loop) would represent a pattern of circular coactivity, for example, where neuron A is coactive with B, B with C, and C back with A. Such a structure could be evidence of a recurrent or cyclic functional motif in the neural circuit. The result $\\beta_1=0$ indicates that no such one-dimensional loops exist in the coactivity structure at threshold $\\tau$. The functional relationships are acyclic, forming a chain-like (as in this specific case) or tree-like structure. The absence of the $\\{n_1, n_3\\}$ coactivity link is precisely what prevents the formation of a loop and leads to $\\beta_1=0$.",

We do not need to consider matching points to the diagonal, as this would result in a higher cost.\n\nLet the points in $D_{\\mathcal{A}}$ be $A_1 = (0, 1)$ and $A_2 = (0, 3)$.\nLet the points in $D_{\\mathcal{B}}$ be $B_1 = (0, 1.2)$ and $B_2 = (0, 2.8)$.\n\nThere are $2! = 2$ possible bijections (matchings) between $D_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $D_{\\mathcal{B}}$. We must calculate the cost for each matching. The cost of a matching is the maximum $d_{\\infty}$ distance among all paired points.\n\nMatching 1:\nPair $A_1$ with $B_1$ and $A_2$ with $B_2$.\n- The distance for the pair $(A_1, B_1)$ is $d_{\\infty}((0, 1), (0, 1.2)) = \\max(|0-0|, |1-1.2|) = \\max(0, 0.2) = 0.2$.\n- The distance for the pair $(A_2, B_2)$ is $d_{\\infty}((0, 3), (0, 2.8)) = \\max(|0-0|, |3-2.8|) = \\max(0, 0.2) = 0.2$.\nThe cost of this matching is the supremum of these distances: $\\sup\\{0.2, 0.2\\} = 0.2$.\n\nMatching 2:\nPair $A_1$ with $B_2$ and $A_2$ with $B_1$.\n- The distance for the pair $(A_1, B_2)$ is $d_{\\infty}((0, 1), (0, 2.8)) = \\max(|0-0|, |1-2.8|) = \\max(0, 1.8) = 1.8$.\n- The distance for the pair $(A_2, B_1)$ is $d_{\\infty}((0, 3), (0, 1.2)) = \\max(|0-0|, |3-1.2|) = \\max(0, 1.8) = 1.8$.\nThe cost of this matching is the supremum of these distances: $\\sup\\{1.8, 1.8\\} = 1.8$.\n\nThe bottleneck distance $d_B$ is the infimum (minimum) of the costs of all possible matchings.\n$$d_B(D_{\\mathcal{A}}, D_{\\mathcal{B}}) = \\min(0.2, 1.8) = 0.2$$\n\nThe matching that achieves this minimum cost is Matching 1. This is the justification for the value of the bottleneck distance. Specifically, the optimal matching is $(0, 1) \\leftrightarrow (0, 1.2)$ and $(0, 3) \\leftrightarrow (0, 2.8)$, for which the maximum edge cost is $0.2$.",
