            "problem": "Consider a single synaptic pathway whose overall effect on a postsynaptic variable is modeled as a time-shifted, linearly filtered version of a presynaptic input. Let the presynaptic signal be $x(t)$ and the postsynaptic response be $y(t)$ defined by the causal convolution $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,x(t - D_c - \\tau)\\,d\\tau$, where $D_c  0$ is a fixed conduction delay and $k(\\tau)$ is a nonnegative synaptic kernel describing dendritic and receptor kinetics. Assume $k(\\tau)$ is a gamma-distributed kernel with integer shape parameter $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and scale parameter $\\theta  0$, that is, $k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^{n}\\Gamma(n)}\\,\\tau^{n-1}\\exp(-\\tau/\\theta)$ for $\\tau \\geq 0$. Many network-level reductions in brain modeling and computational neuroscience seek to replace distributed and mixed delays by a single effective fixed delay. Suppose we aim to approximate the compound effect of $D_c$ and $k(\\tau)$ by a single pure delay $D_{\\text{eff}}$ such that, for band-limited inputs dominated by low angular frequencies, the leading-order phase behavior of the original operator is matched by the pure delay. Starting from the definitions of convolution and the Fourier transform, and without invoking any shortcut formulas, derive an expression for $D_{\\text{eff}}$ in terms of $D_c$, $n$, and $\\theta$ by matching the first-order phase behavior at zero frequency. Then evaluate $D_{\\text{eff}}$ for $D_c = 1.37$ milliseconds, $n = 4$, and $\\theta = 0.28$ milliseconds.

Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is set in the context of computational neuroscience, specifically modeling synaptic transmission. The use of convolution with a kernel to model a postsynaptic potential is a standard technique. The gamma distribution is a very common and biophysically plausible choice for synaptic kernels (it can be interpreted as a cascade of $n$ identical low-pass filters). The concept of approximating a distributed delay with an effective pure delay based on low-frequency phase is a standard analysis technique in systems theory and is widely applied in neuroscience. The problem is well-grounded in its domain.\n\n*   **Well-Posed:** The problem asks for a specific quantity ($D_{\\text{eff}}$) based on a well-defined criterion (matching the first-order phase at $\\omega=0$). The mathematical tools (Fourier transform, Taylor expansion) are standard and applicable. The parameters are given, and the derivation path is outlined. A unique solution is expected.\n\n*   **Objective:** The language is technical and precise. The definitions are mathematical. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n*   **Scientific or Factual Unsoundness:** None. The physics and mathematics are standard.\n\n*   **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant:** The problem is highly formalizable. It is directly relevant to \"synaptic delay modeling\" and \"brain modeling and computational neuroscience\".\n\n*   **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem provides all necessary information. The convolution integral defines the system, the kernel is specified, the approximation criterion is clear. The parameters are consistent. The fact that $n$ is an integer means $\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!$, which simplifies calculations but is not strictly necessary to know beforehand.\n\n*   **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The values given ($D_c=1.37$ ms, $\\theta=0.28$ ms, $n=4$) are physiologically plausible for synaptic transmission.\n\n*   **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured:** The structure is clear. The phrase \"leading-order phase behavior at zero frequency\" uniquely points to the group delay at $\\omega=0$, which is the negative derivative of the phase with respect to $\\omega$, evaluated at $\\omega=0$. This is a well-defined mathematical concept.\n\n*   **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological:** The problem requires a non-trivial derivation involving Fourier transforms and calculus. It is not trivial or tautological. It addresses a core concept in system approximation.\n\n*   **Outside Scientific Verifiability:** The derivation is purely mathematical and can be verified.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Solution Planning\n\n**1. Analyze the original system in the frequency domain:**\n    *   The system is LTI. Its behavior is best characterized by its transfer function, $H(\\omega)$.\n    *   The output is $y(t) = (h * x)(t)$, where $h(t)$ is the system's impulse response.\n    *   The impulse response can be found by setting $x(t) = \\delta(t)$.\n    *   $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,\\delta(t - D_c - \\tau)\\,d\\tau$. Using the sifting property of the delta function, $\\int f(\\tau) \\delta(t - a - \\tau) d\\tau = f(t-a)$, we get $h(t) = k(t - D_c)$. This means the overall impulse response is a delayed version of the kernel $k(t)$.\n    *   The output is $y(t) = k(t-D_c) * x(t)$. Let's re-read the problem statement carefully: $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,x(t - D_c - \\tau)\\,d\\tau$. This is the convolution of $k$ with a delayed version of $x$. Let $z(t) = x(t-D_c)$. Then $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau) z(t-\\tau) d\\tau = (k*z)(t)$.\n    *   Let's use the Fourier transform. The definition I'll use is $F(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(t) \\exp(-i\\omega t) dt$.\n    *   Let $Y(\\omega)$, $X(\\omega)$, and $K(\\omega)$ be the Fourier transforms of $y(t)$, $x(t)$, and $k(t)$ respectively.\n    *   The convolution theorem states that $(f*g)(t) \\Leftrightarrow F(\\omega)G(\\omega)$.\n    *   The time-shifting property states that $f(t-t_0) \\Leftrightarrow F(\\omega) \\exp(-i\\omega t_0)$.\n    *   Let's transform the defining equation: $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,x(t - D_c - \\tau)\\,d\\tau$.\n    *   This is the convolution of $h(t)$ with $x(t)$, where $h(t) = k(t-D_c)$. No, that's not right.\n    *   Let's write the convolution explicitly. The integral is $(k * x_{delayed})(t)$ where $x_{delayed}(t) = x(t-D_c)$.\n    *   So, $y(t) = (k * x_d)(t)$ where $x_d(t) = x(t-D_c)$.\n    *   In the frequency domain: $Y(\\omega) = K(\\omega) X_d(\\omega)$.\n    *   We know $X_d(\\omega) = X(\\omega) \\exp(-i \\omega D_c)$.\n    *   Therefore, $Y(\\omega) = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i \\omega D_c) X(\\omega)$.\n    *   The transfer function of the overall system is $H(\\omega) = \\frac{Y(\\omega)}{X(\\omega)} = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i \\omega D_c)$.\n\n**2. Find the Fourier Transform of the kernel, $K(\\omega)$:**\n    *   $k(\\tau) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^{n}\\Gamma(n)}\\,\\tau^{n-1}\\exp(-\\tau/\\theta)$ for $\\tau \\geq 0$.\n    *   $K(\\omega) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau) \\exp(-i\\omega \\tau) d\\tau$.\n    *   $K(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^{n}\\Gamma(n)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\tau^{n-1} \\exp(-\\tau/\\theta) \\exp(-i\\omega \\tau) d\\tau$.\n    *   $K(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^{n}\\Gamma(n)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\tau^{n-1} \\exp(-(\\frac{1}{\\theta} + i\\omega)\\tau) d\\tau$.\n    *   This is a standard gamma function integral form. Let $s = \\frac{1}{\\theta} + i\\omega$. The integral is $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\tau^{n-1} \\exp(-s\\tau) d\\tau$.\n    *   Recall the definition of the Gamma function: $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_0^\\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt$.\n    *   Let $u = s\\tau$, so $\\tau = u/s$ and $d\\tau = du/s$.\n    *   The integral becomes $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} (u/s)^{n-1} \\exp(-u) (du/s) = \\frac{1}{s^n} \\int_0^\\infty u^{n-1} e^{-u} du = \\frac{\\Gamma(n)}{s^n}$.\n    *   So, the integral is $\\frac{\\Gamma(n)}{(\\frac{1}{\\theta} + i\\omega)^n}$.\n    *   Substituting this back into the expression for $K(\\omega)$:\n        $K(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^{n}\\Gamma(n)} \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma(n)}{(\\frac{1}{\\theta} + i\\omega)^n} = \\frac{1}{\\theta^n (\\frac{1}{\\theta} + i\\omega)^n} = \\frac{1}{(1 + i\\omega\\theta)^n}$.\n    *   This is a well-known result.\n\n**3. Analyze the full transfer function $H(\\omega)$:**\n    *   $H(\\omega) = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i \\omega D_c) = \\frac{1}{(1 + i\\omega\\theta)^n} \\exp(-i \\omega D_c)$.\n    *   The phase of $H(\\omega)$, let's call it $\\Phi(\\omega)$, is the argument of the complex number $H(\\omega)$.\n    *   $\\Phi(\\omega) = \\arg(H(\\omega)) = \\arg(\\frac{1}{(1 + i\\omega\\theta)^n}) + \\arg(\\exp(-i \\omega D_c))$.\n    *   $\\Phi(\\omega) = -n \\cdot \\arg(1 + i\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c$.\n    *   The term $1+i\\omega\\theta$ has a real part of $1$ and an imaginary part of $\\omega\\theta$. Its argument is $\\arctan(\\omega\\theta)$.\n    *   So, $\\Phi(\\omega) = -n \\arctan(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c$.\n\n**4. Analyze the approximating system:**\n    *   The approximating system is a pure delay $D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n    *   Its impulse response is $h_{\\text{eff}}(t) = \\delta(t - D_{\\text{eff}})$.\n    *   Its transfer function is $H_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{\\delta(t - D_{\\text{eff}})\\} = \\exp(-i\\omega D_{\\text{eff}})$.\n    *   The phase of this system is $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\arg(H_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)) = -\\omega D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n**5. Match the phase behavior:**\n    *   The problem asks to match the \"leading-order phase behavior at zero frequency\".\n    *   This means we should match the Taylor expansion of the phase $\\Phi(\\omega)$ around $\\omega=0$ with the phase of the approximating system, $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$.\n    *   $\\Phi(\\omega) = -n \\arctan(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c$.\n    *   Taylor expansion of $\\arctan(x)$ around $x=0$ is $x - \\frac{x^3}{3} + \\dots$.\n    *   So, for small $\\omega$, $\\arctan(\\omega\\theta) \\approx \\omega\\theta$.\n    *   $\\Phi(\\omega) \\approx -n(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c = -(n\\theta + D_c)\\omega$.\n    *   This is the first-order approximation of the phase for small $\\omega$.\n    *   The phase of the pure delay system is $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\omega$.\n    *   Matching the first-order terms: $-(n\\theta + D_c)\\omega = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\omega$.\n    *   This gives $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_c + n\\theta$.\n\n    *   Let's formalize \"matching the first-order phase behavior at zero frequency\". This is equivalent to matching the group delay at $\\omega=0$.\n    *   The group delay is defined as $\\tau_g(\\omega) = -\\frac{d\\Phi(\\omega)}{d\\omega}$.\n    *   For the original system:\n        $\\tau_g(\\omega) = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\left( -n \\arctan(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c \\right)$\n        $\\tau_g(\\omega) = n \\frac{d}{d\\omega} \\arctan(\\omega\\theta) + D_c$\n        The derivative of $\\arctan(u)$ is $\\frac{1}{1+u^2} \\frac{du}{d\\omega}$. Here $u=\\omega\\theta$, so $\\frac{du}{d\\omega} = \\theta$.\n        $\\tau_g(\\omega) = n \\frac{\\theta}{1 + (\\omega\\theta)^2} + D_c$.\n    *   We need to evaluate this at zero frequency:\n        $\\tau_g(0) = n \\frac{\\theta}{1 + 0} + D_c = n\\theta + D_c$.\n\n    *   For the approximating system:\n        $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = -\\omega D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n        $\\tau_{g, \\text{eff}}(\\omega) = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega} (-\\omega D_{\\text{eff}}) = D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n        The group delay is constant for all frequencies.\n\n    *   Matching the group delays at $\\omega=0$: $\\tau_g(0) = \\tau_{g, \\text{eff}}(0)$.\n    *   $n\\theta + D_c = D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\n    *   This confirms the result from the Taylor expansion. The derivation is robust. The expression for the effective delay is $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_c + n\\theta$.\n\n**6. Interpretation of the result:**\n    *   $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_c + n\\theta$.\n    *   $D_c$ is the axonal conduction delay.\n    *   $n\\theta$ is the contribution from the synaptic filtering process.\n    *   What is $n\\theta$? Let's find the mean of the gamma-distributed kernel $k(\\tau)$.\n    *   The mean of a gamma distribution with shape $n$ and scale $\\theta$ is $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = n\\theta$.\n    *   $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau] = \\int_0^\\infty \\tau k(\\tau) d\\tau$.\n    *   So, the effective delay is the sum of the fixed conduction delay and the *mean* delay introduced by the synaptic kernel. This is an intuitive and well-known result in computational neuroscience.\n\n**7. Perform the numerical calculation:**\n    *   $D_c = 1.37$ ms\n    *   $n = 4$\n    *   $\\theta = 0.28$ ms\n    *   $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_c + n\\theta = 1.37 + (4)(0.28)$.\n    *   $4 \\times 0.28 = 1.12$.\n    *   $D_{\\text{eff}} = 1.37 + 1.12 = 2.49$.\n    *   The units are in milliseconds.\n    *   The question asks for the answer rounded to four significant figures.\n    *   The result is $2.49$. This has three significant figures. To express it with four, I should write $2.490$.\n    *   Let's double-check the calculation.\n        $4 \\times 0.28 = 4 \\times (0.25 + 0.03) = 1.00 + 0.12 = 1.12$. Correct.\n        $1.37 + 1.12 = 2.49$. Correct.\n    *   The final answer is $2.490$ milliseconds.\n\n**8. Final review of the entire process:**\n\n*   **Problem:** Approximate a system composed of a pure delay and a gamma-filter with an effective pure delay, matching the low-frequency phase behavior.\n*   **Method:**\n    1.  Represent the system in the frequency domain via its transfer function $H(\\omega)$.\n    2.  The output is convolution, so $Y(\\omega) = H(\\omega) X(\\omega)$.\n    3.  The system is a cascade of a filter with kernel $k(t)$ and a pure delay $D_c$. Oh, wait. Let's re-read the convolution integral again.\n        $y(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,x(t - D_c - \\tau)\\,d\\tau$.\n        Let $u = t - D_c$. Then $t = u + D_c$.\n        $y(u+D_c) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(\\tau)\\,x(u - \\tau)\\,d\\tau = (k*x)(u)$.\n        Let $\\tilde{y}(u) = y(u+D_c)$. Then $\\tilde{y}(t) = (k*x)(t)$.\n        So $y(t)$ is a delayed version of the convolution of $k$ and $x$.\n        $y(t) = (k*x)(t-D_c)$.\n        Let's find the Fourier transform of this.\n        $Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{(k*x)(t-D_c)\\}$.\n        Using the time-shift property: $Y(\\omega) = \\mathcal{F}\\{(k*x)(t)\\} \\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n        Using the convolution theorem: $\\mathcal{F}\\{(k*x)(t)\\} = K(\\omega)X(\\omega)$.\n        So, $Y(\\omega) = K(\\omega)X(\\omega)\\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n        The transfer function is $H(\\omega) = \\frac{Y(\\omega)}{X(\\omega)} = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n        This confirms my initial analysis of the transfer function. The order of operations in the time domain can be interpreted differently, but they lead to the same transfer function. It's a cascade of a filter with impulse response $k(t)$ and a pure delay $D_c$. The order doesn't matter since they are LTI systems.\n\n*   **Derivation:**\n    *   $H(\\omega) = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n    *   $K(\\omega) = (1+i\\omega\\theta)^{-n}$.\n    *   $H(\\omega) = (1+i\\omega\\theta)^{-n} \\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n    *   Phase $\\Phi(\\omega) = \\arg(H(\\omega)) = -n \\arg(1+i\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c = -n\\arctan(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c$.\n    *   Approximating system: $H_{eff}(\\omega) = \\exp(-i\\omega D_{eff})$, phase $\\Phi_{eff}(\\omega) = -\\omega D_{eff}$.\n    *   \"First-order phase behavior at zero frequency\" means matching the first derivative of the phase at $\\omega=0$.\n    *   $-\\frac{d\\Phi}{d\\omega}\\Big|_{\\omega=0} = -\\frac{d\\Phi_{eff}}{d\\omega}\\Big|_{\\omega=0}$.\n    *   $-\\frac{d}{d\\omega}(-n\\arctan(\\omega\\theta) - \\omega D_c)\\Big|_{\\omega=0} = -\\frac{d}{d\\omega}(-\\omega D_{eff})\\Big|_{\\omega=0}$.\n    *   $(n \\frac{\\theta}{1+(\\omega\\theta)^2} + D_c)\\Big|_{\\omega=0} = D_{eff}$.\n    *   $n\\theta + D_c = D_{eff}$.\n\n*   **Numerical calculation:**\n    *   $D_{eff} = 1.37 + 4 \\times 0.28 = 1.37 + 1.12 = 2.49$.\n    *   Rounding to four significant figures gives $2.490$.\n\nThe logic seems sound and the derivation follows the problem's constraints (start from definitions, no shortcuts). The interpretation of \"first-order phase behavior\" as the group delay at zero frequency is standard and correct. The result is physically meaningful. The calculation is straightforward. I am ready to write the solution. I must be careful with LaTeX formatting for every single mathematical entity.\n\nThe solution structure should be:\n1.  Start with the definition of the system relating $y(t)$ and $x(t)$.\n2.  State the intention to analyze this system in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform. Define the transform.\n3.  Apply the Fourier transform to the governing equation to find the system's transfer function, $H(\\omega) = Y(\\omega)/X(\\omega)$. This will involve using the convolution and time-shifting properties of the Fourier transform.\n4.  Derive the Fourier transform of the gamma kernel, $K(\\omega)$.\n5.  Combine the results to get the full transfer function $H(\\omega) = K(\\omega) \\exp(-i\\omega D_c)$.\n6.  Extract the phase $\\Phi(\\omega)$ from $H(\\omega)$.\n7.  Define the transfer function and phase of the approximating pure-delay system, $H_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ and $\\Phi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$.\n8.  State the approximation criterion: matching the first-order phase behavior at $\\omega=0$. Explain that this is equivalent to equating the group delays, $\\tau_g(\\omega) = -d\\Phi/d\\omega$, at $\\omega=0$.\n9.  Calculate the group delay for the original system, $\\tau_g(\\omega)$, and evaluate it at $\\omega=0$.\n10. Calculate the group delay for the approximating system, $\\tau_{g, \\text{eff}}(\\omega)$, which is a constant $D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n11. Equate the two at $\\omega=0$ to find the symbolic expression for $D_{\\text{eff}}$.\n12. Substitute the given numerical values for $D_c$, $n$, and $\\theta$.\n13. Perform the calculation and round the result to four significant figures.\n\nAll seems correct and follows the instructions. I will ensure every number, variable, and symbol is in LaTeX.",

The target is to compute the postsynaptic spike times for a given set of test cases and produce the specified aggregated output.\n\nStart from the following fundamental base:\n- The postsynaptic neuron is modeled as the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model, with membrane potential $V(t)$ governed by the ordinary differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\nfor all $t$ except at discrete input event times.\n- At an input event time $t_{\\mathrm{e}}$, the membrane potential receives an instantaneous jump equal to the sum of all synaptic weights arriving exactly at $t_{\\mathrm{e}}$, so that immediately after the event,\n$$\nV(t_{\\mathrm{e}}^{+}) = V(t_{\\mathrm{e}}^{-}) + \\sum_{j} w_{j},\n$$\nwhere $w_{j}$ are the synaptic weights (in $\\mathrm{mV}$) of all spikes arriving at time $t_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n- A postsynaptic spike is generated at an event time $t_{\\mathrm{e}}$ if and only if $V(t_{\\mathrm{e}}^{+}) \\ge V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, in which case the membrane potential is instantly reset to $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ and enters an absolute refractory period of duration $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, during which the membrane potential stays clamped at $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ and presynaptic inputs have no effect on $V(t)$.\n- Presynaptic spikes fired at time $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ on a given synapse propagate with a conduction delay\n$$\nd = \\frac{L}{v},\n$$\nwhere $L$ is the axonal path length (in $\\mathrm{m}$) and $v$ is the conduction velocity (in $\\mathrm{m/s}$). Arrival times are $t_{\\mathrm{arr}} = t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + d \\cdot 1000$, with $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ in $\\mathrm{ms}$ and $d \\cdot 1000$ converting seconds to milliseconds.\n\nImplement an event-driven algorithm that schedules all presynaptic spikes after their delays, groups spikes that arrive at exactly the same time, and processes events in ascending time order. Between events, the membrane potential must evolve according to the LIF dynamics. At each event, update $V(t)$ by first evolving it from the previous update time using the LIF decay, then applying the net jump. If a spike is emitted, enforce the absolute refractory clamping and ignore inputs that occur strictly before the refractory period ends. When multiple spikes are scheduled to arrive at exactly the same time, sum their weights and treat them as one composite event. Assume numerical grouping by exact equality of arrival times.\n\nYour program must compute and return the list of postsynaptic spike times (in $\\mathrm{ms}$) for each test case, rounded to three decimal places. All quantities must be handled in $\\mathrm{ms}$ for time, $\\mathrm{mV}$ for potential, $\\mathrm{m}$ for distance, and $\\mathrm{m/s}$ for velocity. The program must produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is the list of spike times for the corresponding test case (e.g., $[ [t_{1}, t_{2}], [], [t_{3}] ]$ with all $t_{k}$ in $\\mathrm{ms}$ and rounded to three decimal places).\n\nUse the following test suite, each defined by $(\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}, V_{\\mathrm{rest}}, V_{\\mathrm{reset}}, V_{\\mathrm{th}}, \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})$ and a set of synapses, where each synapse is specified by weight $w$, presynaptic times $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\}$, length $L$, and velocity $v$.\n\nTest case $1$ (happy path with heterogeneous delays):\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Synapses:\n  - Synapse $1$: $w = 7\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{5\\,\\mathrm{ms}, 15\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 2\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n  - Synapse $2$: $w = 5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{8\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nTest case $2$ (simultaneous composite event at threshold equality):\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Synapses:\n  - Synapse $1$: $w = 5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{12\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n  - Synapse $2$: $w = 5\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{12\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nTest case $3$ (absolute refractory period blocking inputs):\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Synapses:\n  - Synapse $1$: $w = 11\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{10\\,\\mathrm{ms}, 11.5\\,\\mathrm{ms}, 22\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nTest case $4$ (inhibitory cancellation at a simultaneous event):\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Synapses:\n  - Excitatory synapse: $w = 9\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{30\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n  - Inhibitory synapse: $w = -4\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{30\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nTest case $5$ (exact threshold with prior decay):\n- Parameters: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $V_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Synapses:\n  - Synapse $1$: $w = 6\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{0\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n  - Synapse $2$: $w = 7.792726\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, $\\{t_{\\mathrm{pre}}\\} = \\{20\\,\\mathrm{ms}\\}$, $L = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $v = 100\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with each element being the list of postsynaptic spike times (in $\\mathrm{ms}$, rounded to three decimal places) for the corresponding test case, in the order of the test cases given above.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded task in computational neuroscience. All parameters and model definitions are provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution. The model is a standard Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron, and the objective is to implement an event-driven simulation to determine its firing pattern in response to delayed synaptic inputs.\n\nThe core of the solution is an event-driven simulation algorithm. This approach is computationally efficient as it processes system state changes only at discrete, meaningful time points—the arrival times of synaptic spikes—rather than simulating time continuously.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical foundation of the model. The sub-threshold dynamics of the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential, $V(t)$, are governed by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{V(t) - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the membrane time constant and $V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$ is the resting potential. Between input events, this equation can be solved analytically. Given a potential $V_0$ at time $t_0$, the potential at a later time $t  t_0$ is:\n$$\nV(t) = V_{\\mathrm{rest}} + (V_0 - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_0}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)\n$$\nThis analytical solution allows us to precisely calculate the membrane potential decay between events without resorting to numerical integration schemes.\n\nThe simulation algorithm proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Event Queue Initialization**: The first step is to determine the sequence of input events. For each presynaptic spike fired at time $t_{\\mathrm{pre}}$ from a synapse with axonal path length $L$ and conduction velocity $v$, the arrival time at the postsynaptic neuron, $t_{\\mathrm{arr}}$, is calculated. The conduction delay $d$ is given by $d = L/v$ in seconds, which is converted to milliseconds for consistency with other time units. Thus, the arrival time is:\n    $$\n    t_{\\mathrm{arr}} = t_{\\mathrm{pre}} + \\left(\\frac{L}{v}\\right) \\times 1000\n    $$\n    All calculated arrival times and their corresponding synaptic weights $w$ are collected. To handle multiple spikes arriving simultaneously, we aggregate them into composite events. This is achieved by creating a map where keys are the unique arrival times and values are the sum of weights of all spikes arriving at that exact time. These composite events are then sorted chronologically to form an event queue that drives the simulation.\n\n2.  **Simulation State Management**: The state of the neuron is tracked using three key variables:\n    - $t_{\\mathrm{current}}$: The current simulation time, corresponding to the time of the last processed event.\n    - $V_{\\mathrm{current}}$: The membrane potential immediately after the last processed event.\n    - $t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}}$: The time at which the current absolute refractory period ends.\n\n    Initially, at $t=0$, the system is assumed to be at rest: $t_{\\mathrm{current}} = 0$, $V_{\\mathrm{current}} = V_{\\mathrm{rest}}$, and $t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}} = -\\infty$ (or any value $\\le 0$) to indicate the neuron is not initially refractory.\n\n3.  **Event Processing Loop**: The simulation iterates through the sorted event queue. For each event $(t_{\\mathrm{event}}, w_{\\mathrm{total}})$:\n\n    a. **Refractory Period Check**: The problem states that inputs arriving during the absolute refractory period are ignored. Therefore, if $t_{\\mathrm{event}}  t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}}$, the event is discarded, and the simulation proceeds to the next event in the queue.\n\n    b. **Potential Evolution**: If the event is not in a refractory period, the membrane potential must be evolved from the time of the last update, $t_{\\mathrm{current}}$, to the current event time, $t_{\\mathrm{event}}$. This evolution is governed by the analytical solution of the LIF decay. A critical aspect is the handling of the interval after a spike. If the neuron was refractory at $t_{\\mathrm{current}}$ (i.e., $t_{\\mathrm{current}}  t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}}$), the potential is clamped at $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ until $t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}}$. The decay then starts from $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ at time $t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}}$ and proceeds until $t_{\\mathrm{event}}$. The potential just before the synaptic input, $V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{-})$, is given by:\n    $$\n    V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{-}) = V_{\\mathrm{rest}} + (V_{\\mathrm{start}} - V_{\\mathrm{rest}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{event}} - t_{\\mathrm{start}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{m}}}\\right)\n    $$\n    where $t_{\\mathrm{start}} = \\max(t_{\\mathrm{current}}, t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}})$ and $V_{\\mathrm{start}}$ is the potential at $t_{\\mathrm{start}}$ ($V_{\\mathrm{current}}$ if not refractory, $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$ if emerging from one).\n\n    c. **Synaptic Integration**: At $t_{\\mathrm{event}}$, the aggregated synaptic weight $w_{\\mathrm{total}}$ causes an instantaneous change in the membrane potential:\n    $$\n    V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{+}) = V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{-}) + w_{\\mathrm{total}}\n    $$\n\n    d. **Spike Generation and Reset**: This new potential $V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{+})$ is compared against the threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n    - If $V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{+}) \\ge V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, a postsynaptic spike is generated. The time $t_{\\mathrm{event}}$ is recorded. The membrane potential is reset to $V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$, and a new absolute refractory period is established by setting $t_{\\mathrm{ref\\_end}} = t_{\\mathrm{event}} + \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The new state becomes $V_{\\mathrm{current}} = V_{\\mathrm{reset}}$.\n    - If $V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{+})  V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, no spike occurs. The potential simply settles at its new value, so $V_{\\mathrm{current}} = V(t_{\\mathrm{event}}^{+})$.\n\n    e. **State Update**: Finally, the simulation clock is advanced to the current event time: $t_{\\mathrm{current}} = t_{\\mathrm{event}}$.\n\nThis loop continues until all events in the queue have been processed. The collected list of postsynaptic spike times for each test case is then rounded to three decimal places and formatted as specified.",

            "problem": "A neuromorphic synapse is to implement biologically realistic synaptic delays in hardware. The physiological effective delay from a presynaptic spike to the peak of the postsynaptic current combines axonal conduction time and synaptic receptor kinetics. Consider the following setting.\n\n- The axonal path length is $L = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$ and the conduction velocity is $v = 1 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n- The synaptic conductance kinetics are well described by a causal bi-exponential kernel with rise time constant $\\tau_{r} = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ and decay time constant $\\tau_{d} = 5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$, with $\\tau_{d}  \\tau_{r}$, so that the conductance starts at zero at spike time and then rises to a single peak before decaying.\n- In hardware, the synaptic delay is implemented by delaying events by an integer number of clock periods $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$, i.e., the configured delay is quantized to the nearest integer multiple of $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$.\n- Presynaptic spike emission time is detected by a comparator that triggers when the presynaptic leaky integrate-and-fire membrane potential crosses threshold. The presynaptic neuron obeys $C_{m} \\, \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{V - E_{L}}{R_{m}} + I(t)$, with leak reversal $E_{L} = -65 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$, threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$, membrane resistance $R_{m} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{M\\Omega}$, and capacitance $C_{m} = 10 \\, \\mathrm{pF}$.

The comparator has an effective voltage resolution of $\\Delta V = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mV}$.\n- The design requirement is that the absolute error between the implemented postsynaptic current peak time and the physiological effective peak time (relative to the true presynaptic spike emission time) must not exceed $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\nStarting from first principles and standard definitions, do the following: define the physiological effective delay as the sum of axonal conduction delay and the synaptic time-to-peak of the bi-exponential kernel; derive the time-to-peak from the kernel definition; linearize the timing error introduced by finite comparator voltage resolution around threshold; and bound the delay quantization error introduced by integer-multiple clocking. Then, by combining these independent error sources additively in the worst case, derive the smallest clock frequency $f_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 1/T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$ that guarantees the absolute timing error requirement is met. Express the final minimum clock frequency in $\\mathrm{kHz}$ and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.",

The total error is the sum of contributions from two independent sources: the timing error in detecting the presynaptic spike, and the quantization error in implementing the synaptic delay. We will analyze these two error sources in the worst case and combine them additively to ensure the total error constraint is met.\n\nFirst, as instructed, we define the physiological effective delay and its components. The total physiological delay from the true presynaptic spike emission time to the peak of the postsynaptic current, denoted $T_{\\text{phys}}$, is the sum of the axonal conduction delay, $\\Delta t_{\\text{axon}}$, and the time-to-peak of the synaptic conductance kernel, $\\Delta t_{\\text{peak}}$.\n\nThe axonal conduction delay is given by the ratio of the path length $L$ to the conduction velocity $v$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{axon}} = \\frac{L}{v}\n$$\nGiven $L = 30 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 1 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$, the axonal delay is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{axon}} = \\frac{30 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}} = 30 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s} = 30 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\n\nThe synaptic conductance kernel is a bi-exponential function of time $t$ after the spike arrival at the synapse, $g(t) \\propto (\\exp(-t/\\tau_d) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_r))$, where $\\tau_d  \\tau_r  0$.

Let $g(t) = A(\\exp(-t/\\tau_d) - \\exp(-t/\\tau_r))$ for some normalization constant $A$.\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dt} = A \\left( -\\frac{1}{\\tau_d} \\exp(-t/\\tau_d) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_r} \\exp(-t/\\tau_r) \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_r} \\exp(-t/\\tau_r) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_d} \\exp(-t/\\tau_d)\n$$\nSolving for $t = \\Delta t_{\\text{peak}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_r} = \\frac{\\exp(-t/\\tau_r)}{\\exp(-t/\\tau_d)} = \\exp\\left(t \\left(\\frac{1}{\\tau_d} - \\frac{1}{\\tau_r}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(t \\frac{\\tau_r - \\tau_d}{\\tau_d \\tau_r}\\right)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_r}\\right) = \\Delta t_{\\text{peak}} \\frac{\\tau_r - \\tau_d}{\\tau_d \\tau_r}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{\\tau_d \\tau_r}{\\tau_r - \\tau_d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\tau_d}{\\tau_r}\\right) = \\frac{\\tau_d \\tau_r}{\\tau_d - \\tau_r} (\\ln(\\tau_d) - \\ln(\\tau_r))\n$$\nUsing the given values $\\tau_r = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\tau_d = 5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{(5 \\, \\mathrm{ms})(0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms})}{5 \\, \\mathrm{ms} - 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}{0.5 \\, \\mathrm{ms}}\\right) = \\frac{2.5}{4.5} \\ln(10) \\, \\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{5}{9} \\ln(10) \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nWhile this value is part of the problem definition, we note that the total error analysis hinges on the *difference* between the physiological and implemented peak times. If the hardware synapse uses the same kinetics, this term will cancel out. The hardware is configured to implement the axonal delay $\\Delta t_{\\text{axon}}$. The total implemented peak time relative to the true spike time is the sum of the detected spike time, the implemented hardware delay, and the hardware synapse's time-to-peak. The physiological peak time is the sum of the true spike time, the axonal delay, and the physiological synapse's time-to-peak. The error is the absolute difference, so the synaptic time-to-peak terms cancel. The total error $\\varepsilon$ is therefore the sum of the spike detection error and the hardware delay implementation error.\n\nNow, we analyze the two sources of error.\n\n1.  **Spike Detection Timing Error ($\\varepsilon_V$)**: This error arises from the finite voltage resolution $\\Delta V$ of the comparator used to detect the threshold crossing. Near threshold, the membrane potential $V(t)$ is assumed to change approximately linearly with time. The rate of change $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is given by the presynaptic neuron's leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) dynamics:\n    $$\n    C_{m} \\, \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{V - E_{L}}{R_{m}} + I(t)\n    $$\n    At the threshold $V = V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, with constant input current $I(t) = I_0$, the slope is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV}{dt}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{1}{C_m} \\left( I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_L}{R_m} \\right)\n    $$\n    A voltage uncertainty of $\\Delta V$ translates into a timing uncertainty $\\varepsilon_V$ given by the linearization:\n    $$\n    |\\varepsilon_V|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{|dV/dt|_{V=V_{\\mathrm{th}}}} = \\frac{\\Delta V C_m}{\\left| I_0 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_L}{R_m} \\right|}\n    $$\n    Substituting the given values: $C_m = 10 \\, \\mathrm{pF} = 10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{F}$, $R_m = 100 \\, \\mathrm{M\\Omega} = 10^8 \\, \\Omega$, $V_{\\mathrm{th}} = -50 \\, \\mathrm{mV} = -0.05 \\, \\mathrm{V}$, $E_L = -65 \\, \\mathrm{mV} = -0.065 \\, \\mathrm{V}$, $I_0 = 0.3 \\, \\mathrm{nA} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{A}$, and $\\Delta V = 0.25 \\, \\mathrm{mV} = 0.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{V}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{th}} - E_L}{R_m} = \\frac{(-0.05 - (-0.065)) \\, \\mathrm{V}}{10^8 \\, \\Omega} = \\frac{0.015 \\, \\mathrm{V}}{10^8 \\, \\Omega} = 0.15 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{A}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV}{dt}\\bigg|_{V=V_{\\mathrm{th}}} = \\frac{1}{10^{-11} \\, \\mathrm{F}} \\left( 0.3 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{A} - 0.15 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{A} \\right) = \\frac{0.15 \\times 10^{-9}}{10^{-11}} \\, \\mathrm{V/s} = 15 \\, \\mathrm{V/s}\n    $$\n    The maximum timing error from the comparator is:\n    $$\n    |\\varepsilon_V|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{V}}{15 \\, \\mathrm{V/s}} = \\frac{1}{60} \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s} = \\frac{1}{60} \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Delay Quantization Error ($\\varepsilon_Q$)**: The hardware implements the axonal delay $\\Delta t_{\\text{axon}}$ by quantizing it to the nearest integer multiple of the clock period $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$. The error of this rounding operation is at most half of the quantization step size.\n    $$\n    |\\varepsilon_Q|_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{clk}}}{2}\n    $$\n\nThe total error, in the worst-case scenario where both errors add up with the same sign, is the sum of the maximum absolute values of the individual errors. This total error must not exceed the specified tolerance $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$\n|\\varepsilon_V|_{\\text{max}} + |\\varepsilon_Q|_{\\text{max}} \\le \\varepsilon_{\\mathrmtot}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions and the given value $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrmtot} = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{ms}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{60} \\, \\mathrm{ms} + \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{clk}}}{2} \\le 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nWe convert the decimal to a fraction: $0.05 = \\frac{5}{100} = \\frac{1}{20}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{60} \\, \\mathrm{ms} + \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{clk}}}{2} \\le \\frac{1}{20} \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nNow, we solve for the maximum allowed clock period, $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{clk}}}{2} \\le \\left(\\frac{1}{20} - \\frac{1}{60}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{ms} = \\left(\\frac{3}{60} - \\frac{1}{60}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{2}{60} \\, \\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{1}{30} \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{clk}} \\le \\frac{2}{30} \\, \\mathrm{ms} = \\frac{1}{15} \\, \\mathrm{ms}\n$$\nThe maximum allowed clock period is $T_{\\mathrm{clk,max}} = \\frac{1}{15} \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe clock frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 1/T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$. To satisfy the condition on $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$, the frequency must satisfy:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{clk}} \\ge \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{clk,max}}}\n$$\nThe smallest clock frequency that guarantees the error requirement is:\n$$\nf_{\\mathrm{clk,min}} = \\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{clk,max}}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{15} \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{s}} = 15 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{Hz} = 15 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in $\\mathrm{kHz}$ and rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe minimum clock frequency is exactly $15 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$. Expressed with four significant figures, this is $15.00 \\, \\mathrm{kHz}$.",
