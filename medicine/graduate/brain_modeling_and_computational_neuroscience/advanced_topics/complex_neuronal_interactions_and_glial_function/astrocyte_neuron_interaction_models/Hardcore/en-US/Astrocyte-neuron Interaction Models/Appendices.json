            "problem": "An astrocyte is modeled to release a gliotransmitter onto a nearby neuron in response to intracellular calcium ion ($[\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$) elevation. Let $C$ denote the calcium concentration, i.e., $C = [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$. Assume the release machinery is an all-or-none cooperative sensor that requires $n$ $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ ions to bind before release can occur. Let $K$ denote the equilibrium dissociation constant for $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ binding (assumed identical for each of the $n$ sites), and assume fast binding equilibrium compared to the timescale of release. Under this limit, the binding polynomial reduces to two dominant states: an unliganded state with statistical weight $K^{n}$ and a fully $n$-liganded state with statistical weight $C^{n}$. The fraction of sensors in the fully liganded state is therefore the ratio of its weight to the sum of the two weights. Assume the instantaneous release rate is proportional to the fraction of fully liganded sensors, with proportionality constant $J_{\\max}$ representing the saturating release rate.\n\nStarting from these assumptions and the law of mass action, derive the functional dependence of the release rate on $C$, and then define the normalized release $f(C)$ as the release rate divided by $J_{\\max}$. Define the $10$–$90$ dynamic range in $C$, denoted $r(n)$, as the ratio of the calcium concentration that produces $f=0.9$ to the concentration that produces $f=0.1$. Express $r(n)$ exactly in closed form as a function of $n$ only. Briefly analyze how changing $n$ modifies thresholding and dynamic range by examining the steepness of $f$ around its half-activation.\n\nReport $r(n)$ as your final answer.

            "solution": "The problem describes a simplified model for gliotransmitter release from an astrocyte, triggered by intracellular calcium concentration, $C = [\\text{Ca}^{2+}]$. The core of the model is a cooperative sensor that requires $n$ calcium ions to bind for activation.\n\nLet us formalize the given assumptions. The model simplifies the system to two dominant states: an unliganded sensor and a fully $n$-liganded sensor. The statistical weight of the unliganded state is given as $K^n$, and the statistical weight of the fully liganded state is given as $C^n$. Here, $K$ represents the equilibrium dissociation constant for each binding site.\n\nThe fraction of sensors in the fully liganded state, which we denote as $P_{active}$, is given by the ratio of the statistical weight of the active state to the sum of the statistical weights of the two dominant states:\n$$P_{active} = \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\n\nThe instantaneous release rate, which we denote as $J$, is proportional to this fraction, with a maximum rate $J_{\\max}$.\n$$J(C) = J_{\\max} \\cdot P_{active} = J_{\\max} \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\nThis is the functional dependence of the release rate on the calcium concentration. This equation is a specific form of the Hill equation, where $n$ is the Hill coefficient representing the degree of cooperativity.\n\nThe problem then defines the normalized release rate, $f(C)$, as the release rate $J$ divided by its maximum value $J_{\\max}$:\n$$f(C) = \\frac{J(C)}{J_{\\max}} = \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n}$$\n\nWe are tasked with finding the $10$–$90$ dynamic range, $r(n)$, which is defined as the ratio of the calcium concentration that yields $f=0.9$ to the concentration that yields $f=0.1$. Let us denote these concentrations as $C_{0.9}$ and $C_{0.1}$, respectively.\n\nFirst, we solve for $C_{0.9}$ by setting $f(C_{0.9}) = 0.9$:\n$$0.9 = \\frac{C_{0.9}^n}{K^n + C_{0.9}^n}$$\nMultiplying both sides by the denominator gives:\n$$0.9 \\left( K^n + C_{0.9}^n \\right) = C_{0.9}^n$$\n$$0.9 K^n + 0.9 C_{0.9}^n = C_{0.9}^n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $C_{0.9}^n$:\n$$0.9 K^n = (1 - 0.9) C_{0.9}^n = 0.1 C_{0.9}^n$$\n$$C_{0.9}^n = \\frac{0.9}{0.1} K^n = 9 K^n$$\nTaking the $n$-th root of both sides, we find:\n$$C_{0.9} = (9 K^n)^{\\frac{1}{n}} = 9^{\\frac{1}{n}} K$$\n\nNext, we solve for $C_{0.1}$ by setting $f(C_{0.1}) = 0.1$:\n$$0.1 = \\frac{C_{0.1}^n}{K^n + C_{0.1}^n}$$\nFollowing a similar algebraic procedure:\n$$0.1 \\left( K^n + C_{0.1}^n \\right) = C_{0.1}^n$$\n$$0.1 K^n = (1 - 0.1) C_{0.1}^n = 0.9 C_{0.1}^n$$\n$$C_{0.1}^n = \\frac{0.1}{0.9} K^n = \\frac{1}{9} K^n$$\nTaking the $n$-th root gives:\n$$C_{0.1} = \\left( \\frac{1}{9} K^n \\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{n}} K = 9^{-\\frac{1}{n}} K$$\n\nThe dynamic range $r(n)$ is the ratio of these two concentrations:\n$$r(n) = \\frac{C_{0.9}}{C_{0.1}} = \\frac{9^{\\frac{1}{n}} K}{9^{-\\frac{1}{n}} K}$$\nThe constant $K$ cancels out, leaving an expression that depends only on $n$:\n$$r(n) = \\frac{9^{\\frac{1}{n}}}{9^{-\\frac{1}{n}}} = 9^{\\left(\\frac{1}{n} - (-\\frac{1}{n})\\right)} = 9^{\\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right)}$$\n\nFor the brief analysis, we consider the steepness of the function $f$ at its half-activation point, which occurs at $C = K$. The steepness is given by the derivative $\\frac{df}{dC}$ evaluated at this point.\n$$\\frac{df}{dC} = \\frac{d}{dC} \\left( \\frac{C^n}{K^n + C^n} \\right) = \\frac{n C^{n-1} (K^n + C^n) - C^n (n C^{n-1})}{(K^n + C^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^n C^{n-1}}{(K^n + C^n)^2}$$\nEvaluating at $C=K$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{df}{dC}\\right|_{C=K} = \\frac{n K^n K^{n-1}}{(K^n + K^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^{2n-1}}{(2K^n)^2} = \\frac{n K^{2n-1}}{4 K^{2n}} = \\frac{n}{4K}$$\nThe steepness is proportional to $n$. A larger $n$ (higher cooperativity) leads to a steeper, more switch-like response. This corresponds to a narrower dynamic range, as shown by our expression for $r(n) = 9^{2/n}$, which decreases as $n$ increases. Thus, a high cooperativity $n$ creates a sharp threshold for activation over a small range of calcium concentrations.\n\nThe final answer requested is the closed-form expression for $r(n)$.",

The ODE system can be written as $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = F(t, \\mathbf{y})$.\n\nThe synaptic coupling term $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} W_{ij} u_j$ is a matrix-vector product, $\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{u}$.

Numerical Integration**\n\nThe system of ODEs is solved using the `solve_ivp` function from the `scipy.integrate` library. This function is a robust, general-purpose ODE solver. We use the 'RK45' method (an explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 5(4)), which is a good default choice for non-stiff problems like this one. We enable the `dense_output=True` option, which provides an interpolation function for the solution. This is crucial for accurately determining the threshold-crossing times required for the speed calculation, as it allows us to evaluate the solution at any point within the integration interval, not just at the discrete steps taken by the solver. For analysis, the solution is sampled on a fine, uniform time grid.\n\n**3. Analysis of Propagation Speed**\n\nThe propagation speed $v$ is calculated based on the times at which the neuronal activity $u_i(t)$ at each site $i$ first crosses a threshold $u_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.5$ from below.\n\nThe algorithm is as follows:\n1.  For each site $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$, find the first time $t_i$ where $u_i(t)$ crosses $u_{\\mathrm{th}}$. This is done by scanning the fine-grained time series `u_sol[i, :]`. When a crossing is detected between time steps $t_j$ and $t_{j+1}$, linear interpolation is used to find a more precise crossing time: $t_{\\text{cross}} = t_j + (t_{j+1} - t_j) \\frac{u_{\\mathrm{th}} - u_i(t_j)}{u_i(t_{j+1}) - u_i(t_j)}$. If no crossing occurs, $t_i$ is considered infinite.\n2.  If the number of sites that cross the threshold is less than half the network size ($N/2$), the activity bump is considered to have failed to propagate, and the speed $v$ is defined as $0$.\n3.  Due to the symmetric setup (initial condition at $i=0$ and symmetric kernel), we expect two waves propagating in opposite directions. We analyze the wave traveling in the positive direction (from $i=0$ towards $i=N/2$).\n4.  We compute the time differences $\\Delta t_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$ for $i=0, \\dots, N/2-1$.\n5.  Following the problem's definition, we only consider \"forward\" propagation steps, where $\\Delta t_i > 0$. The average of these positive time differences gives the mean inter-site propagation time, $\\Delta t = \\langle \\Delta t_i \\rangle_{\\Delta t_i > 0}$.\n6.  The final speed is $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. Since $\\Delta x = 1$, this simplifies to $v = 1/\\Delta t$.\n\n**4. Analysis of Stability**\n\nThe stability is a boolean property determined at the end of the simulation, $T_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1.5$ s. The system is deemed stable if and only if all three of the following conditions are met:\n1.  The spatially-averaged neuronal activity has returned to a low baseline: $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i u_i(T_{\\mathrm{end}}) \\le \\varepsilon_u$, with $\\varepsilon_u = 0.05$.\n2.  The spatially-averaged deviation of potassium from its baseline has settled: $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i |k_i(T_{\\mathrm{end}}) - k_0| \\le \\varepsilon_k$, with $\\varepsilon_k = 0.01$.\n3.  The neuronal activity did not saturate during the entire simulation: $\\max_{i,t} u_i(t) < u_{\\max}$, with $u_{\\max} = 0.99$.\n\n**5. Execution Flow**\n\nThe main program iterates through the specified values of the astrocyte buffering rate $\\gamma = \\{1.0, 0.2, 0.0\\}$. For each $\\gamma$:\n1.  The initial conditions are set: a Gaussian bump for $u_i(0)$ centered at $i=0$ and a uniform baseline for $k_i(0)$.\n2.  The ODE system is integrated from $t=0$ to $t=T_{\\mathrm{end}}$.\n3.  The resulting time series for $\\mathbf{u}(t)$ and $\\mathbf{k}(t)$ are passed to the analysis functions to calculate the propagation speed $v$ and the stability boolean.\n4.  The pair $[v, \\text{stability}]$ is stored.\n5.  Finally, the collected results for all $\\gamma$ values are formatted into the precise string specified in the problem statement and printed.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the simulation and analysis are performed exactly as described, leading to a verifiable and reproducible result based on the principles of numerical analysis and computational modeling.",
