A key hypothesis involves molecular switches that can flip a synapse into a stable, potentiated state. This exercise delves into a classic model of such a switch, the Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CaMKII), where cooperative autophosphorylation creates bistability. By deriving the conditions for this switch-like behavior, you will gain a hands-on understanding of how nonlinear dynamics at the molecular level can form the basis of cellular memory. ",

Autophosphorylation is cooperative: a newly phosphorylated subunit arises when two already phosphorylated subunits form a catalytic complex that phosphorylates a neighboring unphosphorylated subunit. Assume this cooperative autophosphorylation follows mass-action kinetics with an effective rate constant $k_{a}$, and that dephosphorylation is mediated by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) in a first-order manner with rate constant $k_{p}$.

The corresponding rate of increase of $p$ is $k_{a} p^{2}(1-p)$.\n-   Dephosphorylation is a first-order process mediated by PP1, with a rate proportional to $p$ and a rate constant $k_{p}$. The corresponding rate of decrease of $p$ is $k_{p} p$.\n-   The analysis should be performed in a mean-field approximation.\n-   The goal is to derive the deterministic mean-field equation for $p(t)$, find its fixed points, analyze their stability, and find the critical rate ratio $R^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}$ at which a transition to bistability occurs. Bistability is defined as the existence of two stable steady states separated by an unstable one within the domain $p \\in [0,1]$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a simplified but canonical model of CaMKII autophosphorylation, a fundamental mechanism for synaptic memory proposed by Lisman and Goldring. The kinetic scheme is a well-established starting point in computational neuroscience for studying synaptic bistability. This is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a clear set of kinetic rules and asks for a standard dynamical systems analysis (finding fixed points and their stability) to determine a specific parameter condition. The objective is clear and a unique solution is expected.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, mathematical language. It is free of subjective or ambiguous claims.\n-   **Completeness**: All necessary information (the functional forms of the rates and the rate constants) is provided to construct the governing differential equation and perform the required analysis.\n-   **Consistency**: There are no internal contradictions in the provided information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-consistent. It is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe deterministic mean-field equation for the time evolution of $p(t)$, the fraction of phosphorylated subunits, is constructed by balancing the rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The rate of change, $\\frac{dp}{dt}$, is the rate of phosphorylation minus the rate of dephosphorylation.\n\nBased on the provided mass-action kinetics:\n-   Rate in (phosphorylation): $k_{a} p^{2} (1-p)$\n-   Rate out (dephosphorylation): $k_{p} p$\n\nThe resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE) is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = k_{a} p^{2} (1-p) - k_{p} p\n$$\nLet's denote the right-hand side as $F(p) = k_{a} p^{2} (1-p) - k_{p} p$.\n\nThe fixed points (or steady states), $p^{\\ast}$, of the system are the values of $p$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dp}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\nF(p^{\\ast}) = k_{a} (p^{\\ast})^{2} (1-p^{\\ast}) - k_{p} p^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np^{\\ast} [k_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast}) - k_{p}] = 0\n$$\nThis equation gives one immediate solution:\n$$\np_{0}^{\\ast} = 0\n$$\nThis corresponds to the baseline, unphosphorylated state.\n\nThe other fixed points are found by solving the term in the brackets:\n$$\nk_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast}) - k_{p} = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_{a} p^{\\ast} - k_{a} (p^{\\ast})^{2} - k_{p} = 0\n$$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic equation form, $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$\nk_{a} (p^{\\ast})^{2} - k_{a} p^{\\ast} + k_{p} = 0\n$$\nThe solutions for $p^{\\ast}$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{-(-k_{a}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-k_{a})^{2} - 4(k_{a})(k_{p})}}{2(k_{a})} = \\frac{k_{a} \\pm \\sqrt{k_{a}^{2} - 4k_{a}k_{p}}}{2k_{a}}\n$$\n$$\np^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}} \\right)\n$$\nFor these fixed points to be real and distinct, the discriminant must be positive:\n$$\nk_{a}^{2} - 4k_{a}k_{p}  0\n$$\nSince $k_{a}$ is a rate constant and must be positive ($k_{a}0$), we can divide by $k_{a}$:\n$$\nk_{a} - 4k_{p}  0 \\implies k_{a}  4k_{p} \\implies \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}  4\n$$\nWhen this condition holds, there are two additional fixed points, let's call them $p_{+}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{-}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np_{-}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}} \\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_{+}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $0  \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}}  1$, both $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}$ are in the valid physical domain $(0,1)$.\n\nNext, we analyze the linear stability of these fixed points. Stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of $F(p)$ evaluated at the fixed point, $F'(p^{\\ast})$. A fixed point is stable if $F'(p^{\\ast})  0$ and unstable if $F'(p^{\\ast})  0$.\n$$\nF(p) = k_{a} p^{2} - k_{a} p^{3} - k_{p} p\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nF'(p) = \\frac{dF}{dp} = 2k_{a}p - 3k_{a}p^{2} - k_{p}\n$$\n1.  **Stability of $p_{0}^{\\ast} = 0. $**\n    $$\n    F'(0) = 2k_{a}(0) - 3k_{a}(0)^{2} - k_{p} = -k_{p}\n    $$\n    Since $k_{p}$ is a rate constant, $k_{p}  0$. Therefore, $F'(0)  0$, and the fixed point $p_{0}^{\\ast} = 0$ is always stable. This is the \"baseline state\".\n\n2.  **Stability of $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}$.**\n    For these fixed points, we know that $k_{p} = k_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast})$. Substituting this into the expression for $F'(p^{\\ast})$:\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = 2k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 3k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} - [k_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast})]\n    $$\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = 2k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 3k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} - k_{a}p^{\\ast} + k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 2k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} = k_{a}p^{\\ast}(1 - 2p^{\\ast})\n    $$\n    Since $k_a  0$ and $p^{\\ast}  0$ for these two roots, the sign of $F'(p^{\\ast})$ is determined by the sign of $(1 - 2p^{\\ast})$.\n    -   For $p_{+}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}}$, we have $p_{+}^{\\ast}  \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $1 - 2p_{+}^{\\ast}  0$. This makes $F'(p_{+}^{\\ast})  0$, so $p_{+}^{\\ast}$ is a **stable** fixed point. This is the \"potentiated state\".\n    -   For $p_{-}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}}$, we have $p_{-}^{\\ast}  \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $1 - 2p_{-}^{\\ast}  0$. This makes $F'(p_{-}^{\\ast})  0$, so $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ is an **unstable** fixed point. This is the \"unstable threshold state\".\n\nThe system is bistable (two stable states, $p_0^{\\ast}=0$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}0$, separated by an unstable state $p_{-}^{\\ast}0$) when there are three real, distinct fixed points in the interval $[0,1]$. As derived, this occurs when $\\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}  4$.\n\nThe transition to bistability happens at the bifurcation point where the two non-zero fixed points, $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}$, emerge. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero, marking the boundary between one real root (for the non-zero solutions) and two distinct real roots.\n$$\nk_{a}^{2} - 4k_{a}k_{p} = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_{a}(k_{a} - 4k_{p}) = 0\n$$\nSince $k_{a} \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$\nk_{a} - 4k_{p} = 0 \\implies k_{a} = 4k_{p}\n$$\nThe critical kinase-to-phosphatase rate ratio, $R^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}$, is therefore the value of this ratio at the bifurcation point.\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}} = 4\n$$\nAt this critical value, the two non-zero fixed points merge into a single semi-stable fixed point at $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$. For any ratio $\\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}  4$, the system is bistable. The value $R^{\\ast}=4$ marks the onset of this bistability.",

Let $P_1(t)$ be the probability that a given protein is intact (in state $1$) at time $t$. The degradation process is described as a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. This means the transition from the intact state to the degraded state (state $0$) occurs with a constant rate $\\lambda$. Since degradation is irreversible, the degraded state is absorbing. The rate of change of the probability of being intact is solely determined by the probability of leaving this state. This can be described by the following first-order ordinary differential equation, which is the master equation for this two-state system:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_1(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda P_1(t)\n$$\nAt time $t=0$, the protein is assumed to be intact, so we have the initial condition $P_1(0) = 1$.\n\nWe solve this differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_1}{P_1} = -\\lambda dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state at time $0$ to the state at time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{P_1(0)}^{P_1(t)} \\frac{1}{p} dp = \\int_0^t -\\lambda d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|p|]_{1}^{P_1(t)} = [-\\lambda \\tau]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_1(t)) - \\ln(1) = -\\lambda t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_1(t)) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the survival probability of a single protein as a function of time:\n$$\nP_1(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the total number of intact proteins, $N(t)$.

Thus, the evaluation at the upper limit is $0$.\n$$ = 0 - \\frac{\\exp\\left(- \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}\\right) t_d \\right)}{- \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(- \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}\\right) t_d \\right)}{\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $I$:\n$$ I = \\beta A P_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{t_{d}}{\\tau_{p}}\\right) \\left( \\frac{\\exp\\left(- \\alpha t_d - \\frac{t_d}{\\tau_{p}} \\right)}{\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}} \\right) $$\nThe terms $\\exp\\left(\\frac{t_{d}}{\\tau_{p}}\\right)$ and $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{d}}{\\tau_{p}}\\right)$ cancel out:\n$$ I = \\beta A P_{0} \\frac{\\exp(-\\alpha t_d)}{\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}}} $$\nTo simplify the denominator: $\\alpha + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{p}} = \\frac{\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1}{\\tau_{p}}$.\n$$ I = \\beta A P_{0} \\frac{\\exp(-\\alpha t_d)}{(\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1)/\\tau_{p}} = \\frac{\\beta A P_{0} \\tau_{p} \\exp(-\\alpha t_d)}{\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1} $$\n\n**3. Finding the Minimal Stimulation Amplitude $A_{\\min}$**\n\nThe condition for a successful capture event is $I \\ge \\Gamma$. The minimal amplitude $A_{\\min}$ corresponds to the case where the equality holds: $I = \\Gamma$.\n$$ \\frac{\\beta A_{\\min} P_{0} \\tau_{p} \\exp(-\\alpha t_d)}{\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1} = \\Gamma $$\nNow, we solve for $A_{\\min}$:\n$$ A_{\\min} = \\Gamma \\cdot \\frac{\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1}{\\beta P_{0} \\tau_{p} \\exp(-\\alpha t_d)} $$\nThis expression can be written in a more streamlined form by moving the exponential term to the numerator:\n$$ A_{\\min} = \\frac{\\Gamma (\\alpha \\tau_{p} + 1) \\exp(\\alpha t_d)}{\\beta P_{0} \\tau_{p}} $$\nThis is the final expression for the minimal stimulation amplitude required for successful PRP capture. All parameters in the expression are positive (or non-negative for $t_d$), so $A_{\\min}$ is positive, which is consistent with the physical meaning of an amplitude.",
