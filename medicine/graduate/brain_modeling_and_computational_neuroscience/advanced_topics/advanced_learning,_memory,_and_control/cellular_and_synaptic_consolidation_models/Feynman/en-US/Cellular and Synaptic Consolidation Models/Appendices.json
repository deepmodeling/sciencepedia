This exercise establishes the fundamental challenge that consolidation mechanisms must overcome by modeling synaptic proteins as a pool of stochastically degrading components.

            "problem": "In a synaptic consolidation model with no ongoing maintenance or synthesis, suppose synaptic efficacy is supported by a pool of $N_{0}$ identical, functionally necessary proteins that are present at time $t=0$. Each protein is removed irreversibly by degradation events that occur independently across proteins. Assume that for each protein, degradative events occur as a homogeneous Poisson process with constant rate $\\lambda$ per unit time, and let $w(t)$ denote the synaptic efficacy at time $t$. Assume the following relationship between efficacy and the number of intact proteins $N(t)$: $w(t)$ is proportional to the fraction of proteins that remain intact, with proportionality constant equal to the initial efficacy $w_{0}$, that is, $w(0)=w_{0}$ and $w(t)=w_{0}\\,\\frac{N(t)}{N_{0}}$ for all $t\\ge 0$. Starting from the definition of a homogeneous Poisson process and the master equation for survival of a single protein, derive an explicit analytic expression for the expected synaptic efficacy $\\mathbb{E}[w(t)]$ as a function of $w_{0}$, $\\lambda$, and $t$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $w_{0}$, $\\lambda$, and $t$. No units are required for the final expression.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected synaptic efficacy $\\mathbb{E}[w(t)]$ for a model where efficacy depends on a pool of degradable proteins. We are given the initial number of proteins $N_0$, the degradation rate $\\lambda$ for each protein, the initial efficacy $w_0$, and the relationship $w(t) = w_0 \\frac{N(t)}{N_0}$, where $N(t)$ is the number of intact proteins at time $t$.\n\nFirst, we consider the state of a single protein. Let $P_1(t)$ be the probability that a given protein is intact (in state $1$) at time $t$. The degradation process is described as a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$. This means the transition from the intact state to the degraded state (state $0$) occurs with a constant rate $\\lambda$. Since degradation is irreversible, the degraded state is absorbing. The rate of change of the probability of being intact is solely determined by the probability of leaving this state. This can be described by the following first-order ordinary differential equation, which is the master equation for this two-state system:\n$$\n\\frac{d P_1(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda P_1(t)\n$$\nAt time $t=0$, the protein is assumed to be intact, so we have the initial condition $P_1(0) = 1$.\n\nWe solve this differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_1}{P_1} = -\\lambda dt\n$$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial state at time $0$ to the state at time $t$:\n$$\n\\int_{P_1(0)}^{P_1(t)} \\frac{1}{p} dp = \\int_0^t -\\lambda d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln|p|]_{1}^{P_1(t)} = [-\\lambda \\tau]_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_1(t)) - \\ln(1) = -\\lambda t - 0\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P_1(t)) = -\\lambda t\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the survival probability of a single protein as a function of time:\n$$\nP_1(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\n\nNext, we consider the total number of intact proteins, $N(t)$. The initial pool consists of $N_0$ identical proteins, and their degradation processes are independent. Let $X_i(t)$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th protein, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N_0\\}$. $X_i(t) = 1$ if protein $i$ is intact at time $t$, and $X_i(t) = 0$ otherwise. The total number of intact proteins at time $t$ is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$\nN(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_0} X_i(t)\n$$\nWe are interested in the expected number of intact proteins, $\\mathbb{E}[N(t)]$. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N(t)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N_0} X_i(t)\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_0} \\mathbb{E}[X_i(t)]\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, for any protein $i$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i(t)] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i(t) = 1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i(t) = 0) = P(X_i(t) = 1)\n$$\nThe probability that protein $i$ is intact, $P(X_i(t)=1)$, is the single-protein survival probability $P_1(t)$ that we derived.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_i(t)] = P_1(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nSince all proteins are identical and independent, this expectation is the same for all $i=1, \\dots, N_0$. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N(t)]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[N(t)] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N_0} \\exp(-\\lambda t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\n\nFinally, we find the expected synaptic efficacy, $\\mathbb{E}[w(t)]$. The relationship between efficacy $w(t)$ and the number of proteins $N(t)$ is given as:\n$$\nw(t) = w_0 \\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\n$$\nTaking the expectation of both sides, and noting that $w_0$ and $N_0$ are constants:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w(t)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[w_0 \\frac{N(t)}{N_0}\\right] = \\frac{w_0}{N_0} \\mathbb{E}[N(t)]\n$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $\\mathbb{E}[N(t)]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w(t)] = \\frac{w_0}{N_0} \\left( N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\right)\n$$\nThe factor $N_0$ in the numerator and denominator cancels, yielding the final expression for the expected synaptic efficacy:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[w(t)] = w_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)\n$$\nThis expression indicates that the expected synaptic efficacy decays exponentially from its initial value $w_0$ with a time constant of $1/\\lambda$.",

            "problem": "Consider Calcium/Calmodulin-dependent Protein Kinase II (CaMKII) at an excitatory synapse, modeled at the level of a single holoenzyme as a large ring of subunits such that the fraction of phosphorylated subunits at time $t$ is $p(t) \\in [0,1]$. Autophosphorylation is cooperative: a newly phosphorylated subunit arises when two already phosphorylated subunits form a catalytic complex that phosphorylates a neighboring unphosphorylated subunit. Assume this cooperative autophosphorylation follows mass-action kinetics with an effective rate constant $k_{a}$, and that dephosphorylation is mediated by Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) in a first-order manner with rate constant $k_{p}$. Work in a mean-field approximation where encounter probabilities factorize, so that the rate of formation of the catalytic complex is proportional to $p^{2} (1-p)$, and dephosphorylation is proportional to $p$.\n\nStarting only from the described mass-action assumptions and standard dynamical systems stability criteria for fixed points, derive the deterministic mean-field equation for $p(t)$, determine its fixed points, and analyze their linear stability. Using these results, find the condition on $k_{a}$ and $k_{p}$ under which the system has exactly two stable steady states in $p \\in [0,1]$: a baseline state near $p=0$ and a potentiated state at $p>0$, separated by an unstable threshold state.

Stability is determined by the sign of the derivative of $F(p)$ evaluated at the fixed point, $F'(p^{\\ast})$. A fixed point is stable if $F'(p^{\\ast}) < 0$ and unstable if $F'(p^{\\ast}) > 0$.\n$$\nF(p) = k_{a} p^{2} - k_{a} p^{3} - k_{p} p\n$$\nThe derivative is:\n$$\nF'(p) = \\frac{dF}{dp} = 2k_{a}p - 3k_{a}p^{2} - k_{p}\n$$\n1.  **Stability of $p_{0}^{\\ast} = 0. $**\n    $$\n    F'(0) = 2k_{a}(0) - 3k_{a}(0)^{2} - k_{p} = -k_{p}\n    $$\n    Since $k_{p}$ is a rate constant, $k_{p} > 0$. Therefore, $F'(0) < 0$, and the fixed point $p_{0}^{\\ast} = 0$ is always stable. This is the \"baseline state\".\n\n2.  **Stability of $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}$.**\n    For these fixed points, we know that $k_{p} = k_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast})$. Substituting this into the expression for $F'(p^{\\ast})$:\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = 2k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 3k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} - [k_{a} p^{\\ast} (1-p^{\\ast})]\n    $$\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = 2k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 3k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} - k_{a}p^{\\ast} + k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    F'(p^{\\ast}) = k_{a}p^{\\ast} - 2k_{a}(p^{\\ast})^{2} = k_{a}p^{\\ast}(1 - 2p^{\\ast})\n    $$\n    Since $k_a > 0$ and $p^{\\ast} > 0$ for these two roots, the sign of $F'(p^{\\ast})$ is determined by the sign of $(1 - 2p^{\\ast})$.\n    -   For $p_{+}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}}$, we have $p_{+}^{\\ast} > \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $1 - 2p_{+}^{\\ast} < 0$. This makes $F'(p_{+}^{\\ast}) < 0$, so $p_{+}^{\\ast}$ is a **stable** fixed point. This is the \"potentiated state\".\n    -   For $p_{-}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4k_{p}}{k_{a}}}$, we have $p_{-}^{\\ast} < \\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $1 - 2p_{-}^{\\ast} > 0$. This makes $F'(p_{-}^{\\ast}) > 0$, so $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ is an **unstable** fixed point. This is the \"unstable threshold state\".\n\nThe system is bistable (two stable states, $p_0^{\\ast}=0$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}>0$, separated by an unstable state $p_{-}^{\\ast}>0$) when there are three real, distinct fixed points in the interval $[0,1]$. As derived, this occurs when $\\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}} > 4$.\n\nThe transition to bistability happens at the bifurcation point where the two non-zero fixed points, $p_{-}^{\\ast}$ and $p_{+}^{\\ast}$, emerge. This occurs when the discriminant of the quadratic equation is zero, marking the boundary between one real root (for the non-zero solutions) and two distinct real roots.\n$$\nk_{a}^{2} - 4k_{a}k_{p} = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_{a}(k_{a} - 4k_{p}) = 0\n$$\nSince $k_{a} \\neq 0$, we must have:\n$$\nk_{a} - 4k_{p} = 0 \\implies k_{a} = 4k_{p}\n$$\nThe critical kinase-to-phosphatase rate ratio, $R^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}}$, is therefore the value of this ratio at the bifurcation point.\n$$\nR^{\\ast} = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{p}} = 4\n$$\nAt this critical value, the two non-zero fixed points merge into a single semi-stable fixed point at $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.
