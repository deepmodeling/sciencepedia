Use the following general starting points that are widely accepted in brain modeling and computational neuroscience: (i) in the absence of input, a plastic synapse relaxes exponentially toward baseline due to homeostatic and biochemical turnover processes, which at small magnitudes can be captured by a linear “leaky integrator” $\\frac{dw}{dt}=-\\lambda w$ with decay rate $\\lambda>0$; (ii) small, transient plasticity events can be captured as impulsive inputs using the Dirac delta function $\\delta(t)$; (iii) when one network “teaches” another via reactivation, the learner’s plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher’s current trace, consistent with a linearized Hebbian drive for small weights. Adopt the following additional modeling assumptions for a single episodic event at $t=0$: (a) the hippocampal system encodes the event with an instantaneous increment of amplitude $\\eta>0$ represented as an impulse input proportional to $\\delta(t)$; (b) the cortex does not receive this impulse directly but learns from the hippocampus via a coupling strength $\\kappa>0$; (c) there is no cortical feedback into the hippocampus on the timescale of interest; (d) hippocampal and cortical passive decay rates are $\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta>0$, respectively; (e) initial conditions are $w_h(0^-)=0$ and $w_c(0^-)=0$.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Variables**: Hippocampal weight $w_h(t)$ and cortical weight $w_c(t)$.\n- **General Principle (i)**: A plastic synapse in the absence of input relaxes exponentially, described by the linear \"leaky integrator\" model: $\\frac{dw}{dt}=-\\lambda w$ with decay rate $\\lambda > 0$.\n- **General Principle (ii)**: Small, transient plasticity events are modeled as impulsive inputs using the Dirac delta function $\\delta(t)$.\n- **General Principle (iii)**: When one network \"teaches\" another, the learner's plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher's current trace (linearized Hebbian drive).\n- **Modeling Assumption (a)**: At $t=0$, the hippocampal system encodes an event with an instantaneous increment of amplitude $\\eta > 0$, represented as an impulse input proportional to $\\delta(t)$.\n- **Modeling Assumption (b)**: The cortex learns from the hippocampus with a coupling strength $\\kappa > 0$.

The term \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" has a clear interpretation in terms of the relative magnitudes of the decay rates.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Model and Solution\n\n#### 1. Governing Differential Equations\nBased on the provided principles and assumptions, we construct the system of equations.\n\n- **For the hippocampal weight $w_h(t)$**:\n  - Passive decay (Principle i, Assumption d): The rate of change includes a term $-\\alpha w_h(t)$.\n  - Event encoding (Principle ii, Assumption a): There is an impulsive input at $t=0$ of strength $\\eta$, giving a term $+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$.\n  - No cortical feedback (Assumption c): There is no term dependent on $w_c(t)$.\n  Combining these gives the equation for $w_h(t)$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_h}{dt} = -\\alpha w_h(t) + \\eta\\,\\delta(t) $$\n\n- **For the cortical weight $w_c(t)$**:\n  - Passive decay (Principle i, Assumption d): The rate of change includes a term $-\\beta w_c(t)$.\n  - Learning from hippocampus (Principle iii, Assumption b): The cortex learns from the hippocampus, so its plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher's trace, $w_h(t)$. The coupling strength is $\\kappa>0$. This \"teaching\" implies a positive drive, so the term is $+\\kappa\\,w_h(t)$.\n  - No direct impulse (Assumption b): There is no $\\delta(t)$ term in the equation for $w_c(t)$.\n  Combining these gives the equation for $w_c(t)$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_c}{dt} = -\\beta w_c(t) + \\kappa\\,w_h(t) $$\n\n#### 2. Parameter Constraints\n- The constants $\\eta$, $\\kappa$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are all given as positive.\n- The condition \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" refers to the intrinsic dynamics of the memory traces. A \"faster\" system has a shorter time constant or, equivalently, a larger decay rate. The hippocampal decay rate is $\\alpha$ and the cortical decay rate is $\\beta$. Therefore, this condition requires $\\alpha > \\beta$.\n- The full set of constraints is: $\\eta>0$, $\\kappa>0$, and $\\alpha>\\beta>0$.\n\n#### 3. Solution for $t>0$\nWe solve the system of differential equations with initial conditions $w_h(0^-)=0$ and $w_c(0^-)=0$.\n\n- **Solve for $w_h(t)$**:\n  The equation is $\\frac{dw_h}{dt} + \\alpha w_h = \\eta\\,\\delta(t)$.\n  To find the initial condition at $t=0^+$, we integrate across the impulse from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$:\n  $$ \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\frac{dw_h}{dt} dt + \\alpha \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} w_h(t) dt = \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\eta\\,\\delta(t) dt $$\n  $$ [w_h(t)]_{0^-}^{0^+} + 0 = \\eta $$\n  $$ w_h(0^+) - w_h(0^-) = \\eta $$\n  Given $w_h(0^-)=0$, we have $w_h(0^+) = \\eta$.\n  For $t>0$, the delta function is zero, and the equation becomes homogeneous: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt} = -\\alpha w_h$.\n  The solution to this first-order ODE with the initial condition $w_h(0^+) = \\eta$ is:\n  $$ w_h(t) = \\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t} \\quad \\text{for } t>0 $$\n\n- **Solve for $w_c(t)$**:\n  Substitute the solution for $w_h(t)$ into the equation for $w_c(t)$ for $t>0$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_c}{dt} + \\beta w_c = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t} $$\n  This is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. The initial condition is $w_c(0)=0$ (since the input to this equation, $w_h(t)$, is finite for $t>0$, there's no jump in $w_c$ at $t=0$, so $w_c(0^+)=w_c(0^-)=0$).\n  We use the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is $I(t) = e^{\\int \\beta dt} = e^{\\beta t}$.\n  Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n  $$ e^{\\beta t}\\frac{dw_c}{dt} + \\beta e^{\\beta t} w_c = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{\\beta t} e^{-\\alpha t} $$\n  $$ \\frac{d}{dt}(w_c e^{\\beta t}) = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)t} $$\n  Integrate both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n  $$ \\int_0^t \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(w_c(\\tau)e^{\\beta \\tau}) d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)\\tau} d\\tau $$\n  $$ [w_c(\\tau)e^{\\beta \\tau}]_0^t = \\kappa\\,\\eta \\left[ \\frac{e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)\\tau}}{\\beta-\\alpha} \\right]_0^t $$\n  Note that $\\beta - \\alpha \\neq 0$ because we established $\\alpha > \\beta$.\n  $$ w_c(t)e^{\\beta t} - w_c(0)e^0 = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - e^0) $$\n  Using $w_c(0)=0$:\n  $$ w_c(t)e^{\\beta t} = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - 1) $$\n  $$ w_c(t) = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{-\\beta t}e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - e^{-\\beta t}) $$\n  $$ w_c(t) = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}) $$\n  This is the solution for $w_c(t)$ for $t>0$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c+\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta>0$, $\\kappa>0$, $\\alpha>\\beta>0$. Solution for $t>0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t}-e^{-\\beta t}\\right)$.**\n  - The governing equations match our derivation precisely.\n  - The parameter constraints match our derivation, correctly interpreting \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" as $\\alpha > \\beta$.\n  - The closed-form solutions for $w_h(t)$ and $w_c(t)$ for $t>0$ match our solved expressions.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c-\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta>0$, $\\kappa>0$, $\\alpha>\\beta>0$. Solution for $t>0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=-\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t}-e^{-\\beta t}\\right)$.**\n  - The equation for $w_c(t)$ is incorrect. The term $-\\kappa\\,w_h$ represents an inhibitory or depotentiating effect from the hippocampus, which contradicts the problem's premise of the hippocampus \"teaching\" the cortex (consolidation).\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\kappa\\,w_c+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c$. Constraints: $\\eta>0$, $\\kappa>0$, $\\alpha>\\beta>0$. Solution for $t>0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=0$.**\n  - The equations are incorrect. The $w_h$ equation includes a feedback term $+\\kappa\\,w_c$, which is explicitly forbidden by assumption (c). The $w_c$ equation lacks the learning term from the hippocampus, contradicting assumption (b) and principle (iii).\n  - The proposed solution is also inconsistent with the proposed equations.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c+\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta>0$, $\\kappa>0$, $\\beta>\\alpha>0$. Solution for $t>0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\,e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}$.**\n  - The constraint $\\beta>\\alpha>0$ is incorrect. This would mean the cortex is \"faster\" than the hippocampus, contradicting the premise of systems consolidation.\n  - The solution for $w_c(t)$ is mathematically incorrect; it is not the solution to the given differential equation. The correct functional form involves a difference of two exponentials, not a single one.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid.

Analysis of Standard Consolidation Theory (SCT)**\n\nFirst, we solve the differential equations for $H(t)$ and $C(t)$ under SCT.\nThe equation for the hippocampal trace is $\\frac{dH}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} H$ with $H(0) = 1$. This is a standard exponential decay model, and its solution is:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = H(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe equation for the cortical trace is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}(1 - C)$, which can be rewritten as $\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}C = \\frac{1}{\\tau}$, with $C(0) = 0$. This is a first-order linear ODE. The solution is of the form $C(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\frac{t}{\\tau'})$ for some time constant $\\tau'$. Substituting into the ODE, we find $\\tau' = \\tau$. Using the initial condition $C(0)=0$: $0 = 1-\\exp(0) = 1-1=0$, which is satisfied. Thus:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe recall probability in the control condition is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{control, SCT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) + \\beta H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) + \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nWith a complete hippocampal lesion ($s_H=0$), the recall probability is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{lesion, SCT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) + \\beta \\cdot 0 \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe impairment function for SCT is the difference between control and lesion recall:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{control, SCT}}(t) - R_{\\mathrm{lesion, SCT}}(t) = \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThis result shows that under SCT, the impairment due to a hippocampal lesion is greatest for recent memories (small $t$) and decays exponentially for older memories, which is the classic temporally-graded retrograde amnesia or Ribot's law.\n\n**2.2. Analysis of Multiple Trace Theory (MTT)**\n\nNext, we solve the differential equations for $H(t)$ and $C(t)$ under MTT.\nThe equation for the hippocampal trace is $\\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$ with $H(0) = 1$. The solution is a constant:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = 1 $$\nThe equation for the cortical trace is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_c}(1-C)$ with $C(0)=0$. This is the same form as the SCT cortical equation, with $\\tau$ replaced by $\\tau_c$. The solution is:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right) $$\nThe recall probability in the control condition is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{control, MTT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) + \\beta H_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right)\\right) + \\beta $$\nWith a complete hippocampal lesion, the recall probability is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{lesion, MTT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe impairment function for MTT is the difference:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{control, MTT}}(t) - R_{\\mathrm{lesion, MTT}}(t) = \\beta $$\nThis result shows that under MTT, the impairment is constant and does not depend on memory age, predicting a flat retrograde amnesia gradient.\n\n**2.3. Calculation of the Ratio $Q(\\tau, T)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the mean impairments:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt}{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt} $$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{T}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we can compute the ratio of the definite integrals.\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt}{\\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt} $$\nFirst, we compute the integral in the numerator:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\, dt = \\beta \\left[ -\\tau\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{T} $$\n$$ = \\beta \\left( -\\tau\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right) - (-\\tau\\exp(0)) \\right) = \\beta\\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nNext, we compute the integral in the denominator:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta \\, dt = \\beta [t]_{0}^{T} = \\beta T $$\nNow, we form the ratio $Q(\\tau, T)$:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\beta\\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)}{\\beta T} $$\nThe parameter $\\beta$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. The final expression is:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\tau}{T} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression in terms of $\\tau$ and $T$.",

Express your final answer in closed form as a function of $\\lambda_{sp}$ and $w$. Do not provide a numerical approximation; no rounding is required. Your answer must be a single analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the probability that a randomly selected Sharp-Wave Ripple (SWR) event is temporally coincident with neocortical spindle activity.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the given information. The SWR event times are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process on $\\mathbb{R}$ with rate $\\lambda_{SWR}$. The neocortical spindle trough times are modeled as an independent homogeneous Poisson point process with rate $\\lambda_{sp}$.\n\nThe condition for coincidence is defined as follows: an SWR event at time $t$ is considered coincident if there exists at least one spindle trough at a time $s$ such that the absolute difference of their times is no more than half the window width, $w$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$|t - s| \\leq \\frac{w}{2}$$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of this coincidence for a randomly selected SWR event. Let this event be denoted by $\\mathcal{C}$. Due to the property of stationarity inherent to a homogeneous Poisson process, the probability of any event related to the process is invariant under time shifts. This means that the probability that an SWR event is coincident with a spindle does not depend on the specific time $t$ at which the SWR occurs. We can therefore, without loss of generality, fix the time of our randomly selected SWR event at $t=0$ and calculate the probability of coincidence for this specific event.\n\nFor an SWR event at $t=0$, the coincidence condition becomes:\n$$|0 - s| \\leq \\frac{w}{2}$$\nwhich simplifies to:\n$$|s| \\leq \\frac{w}{2}$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition that a spindle trough time $s$ must fall within the interval $[-\\frac{w}{2}, \\frac{w}{2}]$.\n\nThus, an SWR event at $t=0$ is coincident with spindle activity if and only if there is at least one spindle trough event occurring in the time interval $[-\\frac{w}{2}, \\frac{w}{2}]$.\n\nThe spindle trough times form a homogeneous Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{sp}$. A fundamental property of such a process is that the number of events occurring in an interval of a given length follows a Poisson distribution. Let $K$ be the random variable representing the number of spindle troughs in the interval $[-\\frac{w}{2}, \\frac{w}{2}]$. The length of this interval is $L = (\\frac{w}{2}) - (-\\frac{w}{2}) = w$. The parameter (mean) of the Poisson distribution for $K$ is the product of the rate and the interval length, $\\mu = \\lambda_{sp} L = \\lambda_{sp} w$.\n\nSo, the probability mass function of $K$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{sp} w)^k \\exp(-\\lambda_{sp} w)}{k!}, \\quad \\text{for } k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$$\n\nThe event of coincidence, $\\mathcal{C}$, corresponds to the condition that there is at least one spindle trough in the interval, which is the event $K \\geq 1$. The probability of this event, $P(\\mathcal{C})$, is:\n$$P(\\mathcal{C}) = P(K \\geq 1)$$\nIt is simpler to calculate this probability by considering the complement event, $K=0$, which represents the case where there are no spindle troughs in the interval. The probability of the complement event is:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{(\\lambda_{sp} w)^0 \\exp(-\\lambda_{sp} w)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda_{sp} w)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda_{sp} w)$$\n\nThe probability of coincidence is then found by subtracting the probability of the complement from $1$:\n$$P(\\mathcal{C}) = P(K \\geq 1) = 1 - P(K=0)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P(K=0)$, we obtain:\n$$P(\\mathcal{C}) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{sp} w)$$\n\nThis expression gives the probability that a single, randomly chosen SWR event is coincident with spindle activity. It is a function of the spindle rate $\\lambda_{sp}$ and the window width $w$, as required. The independence of the SWR and spindle processes ensures that conditioning on the occurrence of an SWR event does not alter the statistical properties of the spindle process. The rate of SWRs, $\\lambda_{SWR}$, is not needed because the question concerns the conditional probability for a given SWR, which stationarity allows us to analyze independently of the SWR process's overall density.",
