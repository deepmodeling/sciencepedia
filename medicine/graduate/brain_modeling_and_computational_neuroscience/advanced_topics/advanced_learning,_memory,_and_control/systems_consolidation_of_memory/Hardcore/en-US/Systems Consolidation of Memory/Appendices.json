            "problem": "You are modeling systems consolidation of a single memory trace using two interacting synaptic populations: a hippocampal weight $w_h(t)$ and a cortical weight $w_c(t)$. Use the following general starting points that are widely accepted in brain modeling and computational neuroscience: (i) in the absence of input, a plastic synapse relaxes exponentially toward baseline due to homeostatic and biochemical turnover processes, which at small magnitudes can be captured by a linear “leaky integrator” $\\frac{dw}{dt}=-\\lambda w$ with decay rate $\\lambda0$; (ii) small, transient plasticity events can be captured as impulsive inputs using the Dirac delta function $\\delta(t)$; (iii) when one network “teaches” another via reactivation, the learner’s plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher’s current trace, consistent with a linearized Hebbian drive for small weights. Adopt the following additional modeling assumptions for a single episodic event at $t=0$: (a) the hippocampal system encodes the event with an instantaneous increment of amplitude $\\eta0$ represented as an impulse input proportional to $\\delta(t)$; (b) the cortex does not receive this impulse directly but learns from the hippocampus via a coupling strength $\\kappa0$; (c) there is no cortical feedback into the hippocampus on the timescale of interest; (d) hippocampal and cortical passive decay rates are $\\alpha0$ and $\\beta0$, respectively; (e) initial conditions are $w_h(0^-)=0$ and $w_c(0^-)=0$. Under these assumptions, the two-network consolidation model must be a coupled linear time-invariant system driven by the event at $t=0$.

            "solution": "### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Variables**: Hippocampal weight $w_h(t)$ and cortical weight $w_c(t)$.\n- **General Principle (i)**: A plastic synapse in the absence of input relaxes exponentially, described by the linear \"leaky integrator\" model: $\\frac{dw}{dt}=-\\lambda w$ with decay rate $\\lambda  0$.\n- **General Principle (ii)**: Small, transient plasticity events are modeled as impulsive inputs using the Dirac delta function $\\delta(t)$.\n- **General Principle (iii)**: When one network \"teaches\" another, the learner's plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher's current trace (linearized Hebbian drive).\n- **Modeling Assumption (a)**: At $t=0$, the hippocampal system encodes an event with an instantaneous increment of amplitude $\\eta  0$, represented as an impulse input proportional to $\\delta(t)$.\n- **Modeling Assumption (b)**: The cortex learns from the hippocampus with a coupling strength $\\kappa  0$. The cortex does not receive the impulse directly.\n- **Modeling Assumption (c)**: There is no cortical feedback into the hippocampus.\n- **Modeling Assumption (d)**: Hippocampal and cortical passive decay rates are $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$, respectively.\n- **Modeling Assumption (e)**: Initial conditions are $w_h(0^-)=0$ and $w_c(0^-)=0$.\n- **Constraint**: The final model must be a coupled linear time-invariant system.\n- **Objective**: Identify the correct set of governing differential equations, parameter constraints for \"hippocampus faster than cortex\", and closed-form solutions for $w_h(t)$ and $w_c(t)$ for $t0$.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The problem describes a simplified but standard and widely-used model of systems memory consolidation in computational neuroscience. The use of leaky integrators for synaptic decay and coupled linear differential equations to model network interactions is a cornerstone of theoretical neuroscience.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem defines a system of linear ordinary differential equations with specified initial conditions and a forcing function (an impulse). This constitutes a well-posed initial value problem which admits a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem provides all necessary components to construct and solve the model. The principles and assumptions are mutually consistent and lead directly to a specific mathematical formulation without ambiguity. For example, assumption (c) (no feedback) is consistent with assumption (b) (cortex learns from hippocampus). The term \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" has a clear interpretation in terms of the relative magnitudes of the decay rates.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Model and Solution\n\n#### 1. Governing Differential Equations\nBased on the provided principles and assumptions, we construct the system of equations.\n\n- **For the hippocampal weight $w_h(t)$**:\n  - Passive decay (Principle i, Assumption d): The rate of change includes a term $-\\alpha w_h(t)$.\n  - Event encoding (Principle ii, Assumption a): There is an impulsive input at $t=0$ of strength $\\eta$, giving a term $+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$.\n  - No cortical feedback (Assumption c): There is no term dependent on $w_c(t)$.\n  Combining these gives the equation for $w_h(t)$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_h}{dt} = -\\alpha w_h(t) + \\eta\\,\\delta(t) $$\n\n- **For the cortical weight $w_c(t)$**:\n  - Passive decay (Principle i, Assumption d): The rate of change includes a term $-\\beta w_c(t)$.\n  - Learning from hippocampus (Principle iii, Assumption b): The cortex learns from the hippocampus, so its plasticity rate is proportional to the teacher's trace, $w_h(t)$. The coupling strength is $\\kappa0$. This \"teaching\" implies a positive drive, so the term is $+\\kappa\\,w_h(t)$.\n  - No direct impulse (Assumption b): There is no $\\delta(t)$ term in the equation for $w_c(t)$.\n  Combining these gives the equation for $w_c(t)$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_c}{dt} = -\\beta w_c(t) + \\kappa\\,w_h(t) $$\n\n#### 2. Parameter Constraints\n- The constants $\\eta$, $\\kappa$, $\\alpha$, and $\\beta$ are all given as positive.\n- The condition \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" refers to the intrinsic dynamics of the memory traces. A \"faster\" system has a shorter time constant or, equivalently, a larger decay rate. The hippocampal decay rate is $\\alpha$ and the cortical decay rate is $\\beta$. Therefore, this condition requires $\\alpha  \\beta$.\n- The full set of constraints is: $\\eta0$, $\\kappa0$, and $\\alpha\\beta0$.\n\n#### 3. Solution for $t0$\nWe solve the system of differential equations with initial conditions $w_h(0^-)=0$ and $w_c(0^-)=0$.\n\n- **Solve for $w_h(t)$**:\n  The equation is $\\frac{dw_h}{dt} + \\alpha w_h = \\eta\\,\\delta(t)$.\n  To find the initial condition at $t=0^+$, we integrate across the impulse from $t=0^-$ to $t=0^+$:\n  $$ \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\frac{dw_h}{dt} dt + \\alpha \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} w_h(t) dt = \\int_{0^-}^{0^+} \\eta\\,\\delta(t) dt $$\n  $$ [w_h(t)]_{0^-}^{0^+} + 0 = \\eta $$\n  $$ w_h(0^+) - w_h(0^-) = \\eta $$\n  Given $w_h(0^-)=0$, we have $w_h(0^+) = \\eta$.\n  For $t0$, the delta function is zero, and the equation becomes homogeneous: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt} = -\\alpha w_h$.\n  The solution to this first-order ODE with the initial condition $w_h(0^+) = \\eta$ is:\n  $$ w_h(t) = \\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t} \\quad \\text{for } t0 $$\n\n- **Solve for $w_c(t)$**:\n  Substitute the solution for $w_h(t)$ into the equation for $w_c(t)$ for $t0$:\n  $$ \\frac{dw_c}{dt} + \\beta w_c = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t} $$\n  This is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE. The initial condition is $w_c(0)=0$ (since the input to this equation, $w_h(t)$, is finite for $t0$, there's no jump in $w_c$ at $t=0$, so $w_c(0^+)=w_c(0^-)=0$).\n  We use the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor is $I(t) = e^{\\int \\beta dt} = e^{\\beta t}$.\n  Multiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n  $$ e^{\\beta t}\\frac{dw_c}{dt} + \\beta e^{\\beta t} w_c = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{\\beta t} e^{-\\alpha t} $$\n  $$ \\frac{d}{dt}(w_c e^{\\beta t}) = \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)t} $$\n  Integrate both sides from $0$ to $t$:\n  $$ \\int_0^t \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(w_c(\\tau)e^{\\beta \\tau}) d\\tau = \\int_0^t \\kappa\\,\\eta\\,e^{(\\beta - \\alpha)\\tau} d\\tau $$\n  $$ [w_c(\\tau)e^{\\beta \\tau}]_0^t = \\kappa\\,\\eta \\left[ \\frac{e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)\\tau}}{\\beta-\\alpha} \\right]_0^t $$\n  Note that $\\beta - \\alpha \\neq 0$ because we established $\\alpha  \\beta$.\n  $$ w_c(t)e^{\\beta t} - w_c(0)e^0 = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - e^0) $$\n  Using $w_c(0)=0$:\n  $$ w_c(t)e^{\\beta t} = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - 1) $$\n  $$ w_c(t) = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{-\\beta t}e^{(\\beta-\\alpha)t} - e^{-\\beta t}) $$\n  $$ w_c(t) = \\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha} (e^{-\\alpha t} - e^{-\\beta t}) $$\n  This is the solution for $w_c(t)$ for $t0$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n- **A. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c+\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta0$, $\\kappa0$, $\\alpha\\beta0$. Solution for $t0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t}-e^{-\\beta t}\\right)$.**\n  - The governing equations match our derivation precisely.\n  - The parameter constraints match our derivation, correctly interpreting \"hippocampus faster than cortex\" as $\\alpha  \\beta$.\n  - The closed-form solutions for $w_h(t)$ and $w_c(t)$ for $t0$ match our solved expressions.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **B. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c-\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta0$, $\\kappa0$, $\\alpha\\beta0$. Solution for $t0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=-\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\beta-\\alpha}\\left(e^{-\\alpha t}-e^{-\\beta t}\\right)$.**\n  - The equation for $w_c(t)$ is incorrect. The term $-\\kappa\\,w_h$ represents an inhibitory or depotentiating effect from the hippocampus, which contradicts the problem's premise of the hippocampus \"teaching\" the cortex (consolidation).\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **C. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\kappa\\,w_c+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c$. Constraints: $\\eta0$, $\\kappa0$, $\\alpha\\beta0$. Solution for $t0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=0$.**\n  - The equations are incorrect. The $w_h$ equation includes a feedback term $+\\kappa\\,w_c$, which is explicitly forbidden by assumption (c). The $w_c$ equation lacks the learning term from the hippocampus, contradicting assumption (b) and principle (iii).\n  - The proposed solution is also inconsistent with the proposed equations.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. Equations: $\\frac{dw_h}{dt}=-\\alpha w_h+\\eta\\,\\delta(t)$ and $\\frac{dw_c}{dt}=-\\beta w_c+\\kappa\\,w_h$. Constraints: $\\eta0$, $\\kappa0$, $\\beta\\alpha0$. Solution for $t0$: $w_h(t)=\\eta\\,e^{-\\alpha t}$ and $w_c(t)=\\frac{\\kappa\\,\\eta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\,e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}$.**\n  - The constraint $\\beta\\alpha0$ is incorrect. This would mean the cortex is \"faster\" than the hippocampus, contradicting the premise of systems consolidation.\n  - The solution for $w_c(t)$ is mathematically incorrect; it is not the solution to the given differential equation. The correct functional form involves a difference of two exponentials, not a single one.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.",

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid.

Analysis of Standard Consolidation Theory (SCT)**\n\nFirst, we solve the differential equations for $H(t)$ and $C(t)$ under SCT.\nThe equation for the hippocampal trace is $\\frac{dH}{dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} H$ with $H(0) = 1$. This is a standard exponential decay model, and its solution is:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = H(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe equation for the cortical trace is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}(1 - C)$, which can be rewritten as $\\frac{dC}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}C = \\frac{1}{\\tau}$, with $C(0) = 0$. This is a first-order linear ODE. The solution is of the form $C(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\frac{t}{\\tau'})$ for some time constant $\\tau'$. Substituting into the ODE, we find $\\tau' = \\tau$. Using the initial condition $C(0)=0$: $0 = 1-\\exp(0) = 1-1=0$, which is satisfied. Thus:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe recall probability in the control condition is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{control, SCT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) + \\beta H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) + \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nWith a complete hippocampal lesion ($s_H=0$), the recall probability is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{lesion, SCT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) + \\beta \\cdot 0 \\cdot H_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe impairment function for SCT is the difference between control and lesion recall:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{control, SCT}}(t) - R_{\\mathrm{lesion, SCT}}(t) = \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThis result shows that under SCT, the impairment due to a hippocampal lesion is greatest for recent memories (small $t$) and decays exponentially for older memories, which is the classic temporally-graded retrograde amnesia or Ribot's law.\n\n**2.2. Analysis of Multiple Trace Theory (MTT)**\n\nNext, we solve the differential equations for $H(t)$ and $C(t)$ under MTT.\nThe equation for the hippocampal trace is $\\frac{dH}{dt} = 0$ with $H(0) = 1$. The solution is a constant:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = 1 $$\nThe equation for the cortical trace is $\\frac{dC}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_c}(1-C)$ with $C(0)=0$. This is the same form as the SCT cortical equation, with $\\tau$ replaced by $\\tau_c$. The solution is:\n$$ C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right) $$\nThe recall probability in the control condition is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{control, MTT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) + \\beta H_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right)\\right) + \\beta $$\nWith a complete hippocampal lesion, the recall probability is:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{lesion, MTT}}(t) = \\alpha C_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = \\alpha\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_c}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe impairment function for MTT is the difference:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{control, MTT}}(t) - R_{\\mathrm{lesion, MTT}}(t) = \\beta $$\nThis result shows that under MTT, the impairment is constant and does not depend on memory age, predicting a flat retrograde amnesia gradient.\n\n**2.3. Calculation of the Ratio $Q(\\tau, T)$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the mean impairments:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt}{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt} $$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{T}$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, so we can compute the ratio of the definite integrals.\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt}{\\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt} $$\nFirst, we compute the integral in the numerator:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{SCT}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\, dt = \\beta \\left[ -\\tau\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{T} $$\n$$ = \\beta \\left( -\\tau\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right) - (-\\tau\\exp(0)) \\right) = \\beta\\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nNext, we compute the integral in the denominator:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} I_{\\mathrm{MTT}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta \\, dt = \\beta [t]_{0}^{T} = \\beta T $$\nNow, we form the ratio $Q(\\tau, T)$:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\beta\\tau \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)}{\\beta T} $$\nThe parameter $\\beta$ cancels from the numerator and denominator. The final expression is:\n$$ Q(\\tau, T) = \\frac{\\tau}{T} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression in terms of $\\tau$ and $T$.",

Retrieval is declared successful if at least $m$ engram units become active and at most $r$ non-engram units become active.\n\nYour task is to derive, from first principles of probability applied to Gaussian noise and threshold detection, an expression for the retrieval probability as a function of $(N, S, \\mu_s, \\mu_n, \\sigma^2, \\theta, m, r)$, under the assumption that unit inputs are independent conditioned on the HPC pointer. Then, implement a program to evaluate this probability numerically for a provided test suite.\n\nUse only the following base facts:\n- Additive independent Gaussian noise: for each unit $i$, input $X_i = \\mu_i + \\xi_i$ where $\\xi_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^2)$ and $\\mu_i \\in \\{\\mu_s, \\mu_n\\}$ depending on whether unit $i$ is an engram or non-engram unit.\n- The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution relates threshold crossing probabilities: if $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$, then $\\Pr(Z \\le z) = \\Phi(z)$, where $\\Phi(\\cdot)$ is the standard normal CDF.\n- Sums of independent Bernoulli random variables yield binomial distributions: the number of successes in $n$ independent Bernoulli trials with common success probability $p$ follows $\\mathrm{Binomial}(n,p)$.\n\nFormulate retrieval as a joint event over two independent counts: the number of engram units crossing threshold and the number of non-engram units crossing threshold. Express the retrieval probability as a double sum over binomial probabilities meeting the success criteria, as implied by the thresholded activation rule and Gaussian noise.\n\nYour program should compute the retrieval probability for the following parameter sets, which serve as a test suite:\n- Test case $1$: $N = 100$, $S = 20$, $\\mu_s = 1.5$, $\\mu_n = 0.0$, $\\sigma^2 = 0.25$, $\\theta = 1.0$, $m = 15$, $r = 5$.\n- Test case $2$: $N = 50$, $S = 10$, $\\mu_s = 1.0$, $\\mu_n = 0.0$, $\\sigma^2 = 1.0$, $\\theta = 1.0$, $m = 5$, $r = 2$.\n- Test case $3$: $N = 100$, $S = 20$, $\\mu_s = 1.5$, $\\mu_n = 0.0$, $\\sigma^2 = 4.0$, $\\theta = 1.0$, $m = 12$, $r = 8$.\n- Test case $4$: $N = 80$, $S = 30$, $\\mu_s = 0.0$, $\\mu_n = 0.0$, $\\sigma^2 = 0.25$, $\\theta = 1.0$, $m = 20$, $r = 3$.\n- Test case $5$: $N = 60$, $S = 10$, $\\mu_s = 2.0$, $\\mu_n = -0.5$, $\\sigma^2 = 0.25$, $\\theta = 1.0$, $m = 8$, $r = 0$.\n\nAll variables are dimensionless, and angles are not involved. For each test case, the output must be a single real number representing the retrieval probability. Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[result_1,result_2,result_3,result_4,result_5]$). The order must match the test suite ordering above. No additional text should be printed.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an expression for the retrieval probability in a pointer-driven reactivation model of systems consolidation and an implementation to compute this probability for several test cases. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters and definitions are provided. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as follows.\n\n**1. Single-Unit Activation Probability**\n\nLet $X_i$ be the input to a cortical unit $i$. The input is the sum of a mean signal $\\mu_i$ and independent Gaussian noise $\\xi_i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. A unit becomes active if its input $X_i$ exceeds a threshold $\\theta$. We need to find the probability of this event for both engram and non-engram units.\n\nFor an **engram unit**, the input mean is $\\mu_s$. The input is $X_s = \\mu_s + \\xi_i$, where $\\xi_i$ is a sample from $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. The unit activates if $X_s \\ge \\theta$. The probability of activation for a single engram unit, denoted $p_s$, is:\n$$ p_s = \\Pr(X_s \\ge \\theta) = \\Pr(\\mu_s + \\xi_i \\ge \\theta) = \\Pr(\\xi_i \\ge \\theta - \\mu_s) $$\nTo use the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(z) = \\Pr(Z \\le z)$ where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, we standardize the random variable $\\xi_i$ by dividing by its standard deviation, $\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}$.\n$$ p_s = \\Pr\\left(\\frac{\\xi_i}{\\sigma} \\ge \\frac{\\theta - \\mu_s}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\nSince $\\frac{\\xi_i}{\\sigma} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, we can write:\n$$ p_s = \\Pr\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{\\theta - \\mu_s}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Pr\\left(Z  \\frac{\\theta - \\mu_s}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\mu_s}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\n\nFor a **non-engram unit**, the input mean is $\\mu_n$. The input is $X_n = \\mu_n + \\xi_i$. The probability of activation for a single non-engram unit, denoted $p_n$, is derived similarly:\n$$ p_n = \\Pr(X_n \\ge \\theta) = \\Pr(\\mu_n + \\xi_i \\ge \\theta) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\mu_n}{\\sigma}\\right) $$\n\n**2. Number of Active Units**\n\nThe cortical layer contains $S$ engram units and $N-S$ non-engram units. Since the noise added to each unit's input is independent, the activation of each unit is an independent Bernoulli trial.\n\nLet $K_s$ be the random variable for the number of active engram units. Since there are $S$ engram units, each activating with probability $p_s$, $K_s$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$ K_s \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(S, p_s) $$\nThe probability of exactly $k_s$ engram units becoming active is given by the binomial probability mass function (PMF):\n$$ \\Pr(K_s = k_s) = \\binom{S}{k_s} p_s^{k_s} (1-p_s)^{S-k_s} $$\n\nSimilarly, let $K_n$ be the random variable for the number of active non-engram units. There are $N-S$ non-engram units, each activating with probability $p_n$. Thus, $K_n$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$ K_n \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(N-S, p_n) $$\nThe probability of exactly $k_n$ non-engram units becoming active is:\n$$ \\Pr(K_n = k_n) = \\binom{N-S}{k_n} p_n^{k_n} (1-p_n)^{N-S-k_n} $$\n\n**3. Retrieval Success Probability**\n\nRetrieval is successful if two conditions are met simultaneously:\n1. The number of active engram units is at least $m$: $K_s \\ge m$.\n2. The number of active non-engram units is at most $r$: $K_n \\le r$.\n\nLet $P_s$ be the probability of the first condition and $P_n$ be the probability of the second condition. The total retrieval probability, $P_{\\text{retrieval}}$, is the probability of the joint event $(K_s \\ge m) \\cap (K_n \\le r)$. Since the engram and non-engram populations are disjoint and unit activations are independent, the random variables $K_s$ and $K_n$ are independent. Therefore, the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$ P_{\\text{retrieval}} = \\Pr(K_s \\ge m \\text{ and } K_n \\le r) = \\Pr(K_s \\ge m) \\times \\Pr(K_n \\le r) = P_s \\times P_n $$\n\nWe can express $P_s$ and $P_n$ as sums of binomial probabilities:\n$$ P_s = \\Pr(K_s \\ge m) = \\sum_{k_s=m}^{S} \\Pr(K_s = k_s) = \\sum_{k_s=m}^{S} \\binom{S}{k_s} p_s^{k_s} (1-p_s)^{S-k_s} $$\n$$ P_n = \\Pr(K_n \\le r) = \\sum_{k_n=0}^{r} \\Pr(K_n = k_n) = \\sum_{k_n=0}^{r} \\binom{N-S}{k_n} p_n^{k_n} (1-p_n)^{N-S-k_n} $$\nThese sums correspond to the survival function (or complementary CDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the respective binomial distributions.\n\nSpecifically, $P_s$ is the survival function of $\\mathrm{Binomial}(S, p_s)$ evaluated at $m-1$, i.e., $1 - F_{K_s}(m-1)$, where $F_{K_s}$ is the CDF of $K_s$. And $P_n$ is the CDF of $\\mathrm{Binomial}(N-S, p_n)$ evaluated at $r$, i.e., $F_{K_n}(r)$.\n\n**4. Final Expression**\n\nThe final expression for the retrieval probability is:\n$$ P_{\\text{retrieval}} = \\left( \\sum_{k_s=m}^{S} \\binom{S}{k_s} p_s^{k_s} (1-p_s)^{S-k_s} \\right) \\times \\left( \\sum_{k_n=0}^{r} \\binom{N-S}{k_n} p_n^{k_n} (1-p_n)^{N-S-k_n} \\right) $$\nwith\n$$ p_s = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\mu_s}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad p_n = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\theta - \\mu_n}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}}\\right) $$\n\nThis formulation will be implemented numerically using statistical functions for the normal CDF and binomial distributions.",
