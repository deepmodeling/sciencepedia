            "problem": "A deep brain stimulation (DBS) system is modeled as a current-controlled pulse generator delivering symmetric, charge-balanced, biphasic rectangular pulses to a single cylindrical contact. The electrode-tissue interface is approximated by a purely resistive load of resistance $R$, and the stimulator has a finite compliance voltage $V_{c}$. For each phase, the rectangular current pulse has amplitude $I$ and duration $t_{p}$. The maximum safe charge density per phase at the contact is $\\sigma_{\\max}$, and the electrically active contact surface area is $A$. Assume zero interphase gap and no capacitive charging dynamics.\n\nUse the following parameter values:\n- Contact area: $A = 6.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n- Maximum safe charge density per phase: $\\sigma_{\\max} = 0.3~\\mathrm{C/m}^{2}$.\n- Resistive load: $R = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}~\\Omega$.\n- Compliance voltage: $V_{c} = 9.6~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nStarting from first principles:\n- Define the per-phase delivered charge $Q$ using the time integral of current, and the charge density $\\sigma$ as charge per unit area.\n- Impose the safety constraint $\\sigma \\leq \\sigma_{\\max}$ and derive the analytic expression for the boundary of allowable amplitude-width pairs, written as the maximum allowable amplitude as a function of width, $I_{\\text{max}}(t_{p})$.\n- At the compliance limit, where the device can just maintain the programmed current against the load, use $V_{c}$ and $R$ to determine the compliance-limited amplitude.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It presents a simplified but standard model of deep brain stimulation, using fundamental principles of physics and electrical engineering. All necessary parameters are provided, and the objectives are clearly defined.\n\nThe problem asks for two results derived from this model:\n1. An analytic expression for the maximum allowable current amplitude, $I_{\\text{max}}$, as a function of pulse width, $t_{p}$, based on a safety constraint for charge density.\n2. The numerical value of the total energy per pulse delivered under specific conditions where the stimulator operates at its compliance voltage limit and the pulse width is maximized according to the safety constraint.\n\nWe begin by establishing the fundamental relationships.\n\nFirst, we define the charge delivered per phase, $Q$. For a rectangular current pulse of constant amplitude $I$ and duration $t_{p}$, the charge is the product of current and time:\n$$Q = I \\cdot t_{p}$$\nThe charge density, $\\sigma$, is the charge per unit area, $A$, of the electrode contact:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{Q}{A} = \\frac{I \\cdot t_{p}}{A}$$\nThe problem imposes a safety constraint that the charge density per phase must not exceed a maximum value, $\\sigma_{\\max}$:\n$$\\sigma \\leq \\sigma_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma$, we have:\n$$\\frac{I \\cdot t_{p}}{A} \\leq \\sigma_{\\max}$$\nThe boundary of the safe operating region is defined by the equality. On this boundary, the current is the maximum allowable current, $I_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$\\frac{I_{\\text{max}} \\cdot t_{p}}{A} = \\sigma_{\\max}$$\nSolving for $I_{\\text{max}}$ as a function of $t_{p}$ yields the first required expression:\n$$I_{\\text{max}}(t_{p}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} A}{t_{p}}$$\nThis expression describes the hyperbolic relationship between the maximum safe current amplitude and the pulse width.\n\nNext, we address the second part of the problem. The stimulator has a finite compliance voltage, $V_{c}$, which is the maximum voltage it can generate. According to Ohm's law, the voltage $V$ required to drive a current $I$ through a resistive load $R$ is $V = I R$. The system is at its compliance limit when the required voltage equals $V_{c}$. This defines the compliance-limited current amplitude, which we will denote as $I_{\\text{comp}}$:\n$$V_{c} = I_{\\text{comp}} R$$\n$$I_{\\text{comp}} = \\frac{V_{c}}{R}$$\nThe problem specifies that we operate at this particular current amplitude, $I = I_{\\text{comp}}$. We are then asked to find the largest pulse width, let's call it $t_{p}^{*}$, that is permitted by the charge-density constraint at this current. This corresponds to operating at a point that lies on both the compliance limit and the safety boundary. We find $t_{p}^{*}$ by substituting $I = I_{\\text{comp}}$ into the safety boundary equation:\n$$I_{\\text{comp}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} A}{t_{p}^{*}}$$\nSolving for $t_{p}^{*}$:\n$$t_{p}^{*} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\max} A}{I_{\\text{comp}}}$$\nNow, we must calculate the total energy per pulse, $E_{\\text{total}}$, delivered to the load under these conditions. The pulse is biphasic, meaning it consists of two phases. We assume a symmetric pulse, so the second phase has the same duration $t_{p}^{*}$ and current magnitude $I_{\\text{comp}}$. The total duration of current delivery is $2t_{p}^{*}$.\n\nThe instantaneous power, $P$, delivered to a resistive load is given by $P = VI$. At the compliance limit, the voltage magnitude across the load during stimulation is maintained at $V_{c}$, and the current magnitude is $I_{\\text{comp}}$. Thus, the power delivered during each phase is constant:\n$$P = V_{c} I_{\\text{comp}}$$\nThe energy delivered in a single phase, $E_{\\text{phase}}$, is the power multiplied by the phase duration, $t_{p}^{*}$:\n$$E_{\\text{phase}} = P \\cdot t_{p}^{*} = V_{c} I_{\\text{comp}} t_{p}^{*}$$\nThe total energy for the biphasic pulse is the sum of the energies of the two phases:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\cdot E_{\\text{phase}} = 2 V_{c} I_{\\text{comp}} t_{p}^{*}$$\nWe can find a more direct expression for the energy. Recall the definition of charge per phase at the safety limit: $Q = \\sigma_{\\max} A$. Also, by definition, $Q = I_{\\text{comp}} t_{p}^{*}$. Therefore, we can substitute $I_{\\text{comp}} t_{p}^{*}$ with $\\sigma_{\\max} A$ in the energy equation:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2 V_{c} (\\sigma_{\\max} A)$$\nThis elegant result shows that the energy at this specific operating point depends only on the compliance voltage, the maximum safe charge density, and the electrode area, and is independent of the tissue resistance $R$ (although $R$ was needed to define the compliance-limited current which led us to this point).\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$V_{c} = 9.6~\\mathrm{V}$\n$\\sigma_{\\max} = 0.3~\\mathrm{C/m}^{2}$\n$A = 6.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nThe total energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 2 \\cdot (9.6~\\mathrm{V}) \\cdot (0.3~\\mathrm{C/m}^{2}) \\cdot (6.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{m}^{2})$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (19.2) \\cdot (0.3) \\cdot (6.2 \\times 10^{-6})~\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (5.76) \\cdot (6.2 \\times 10^{-6})~\\mathrm{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 35.712 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem asks for the energy in microjoules ($\\mu\\mathrm{J}$), where $1~\\mu\\mathrm{J} = 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{J}$.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 35.712~\\mu\\mathrm{J}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $35.71~\\mu\\mathrm{J}$.\n\nThe two required results are the symbolic expression for $I_{\\text{max}}(t_p)$ and the numerical value for the total energy per pulse.\n1.

The quasi-static approximation is standard for low-frequency biological phenomena. The setup is a canonical boundary-value problem.

The solution will proceed by deriving the governing equations and then applying the method of images to satisfy the specified boundary condition.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation and Boundary Condition\nThe analysis begins with the continuity equation for electric charge. For a steady current, the time derivative of charge density is zero, so the divergence of the current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is equal to the current source density $I_v$:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}) = I_v(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nFor a point source of current $I$ located at $\\mathbf{r}_0$, the source density is given by $I_v(\\mathbf{r}) = I \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0)$, where $\\delta$ is the Dirac delta function.\nThe constitutive relation for a homogeneous, isotropic ohmic conductor is $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, where $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.\nUnder the quasi-static assumption, the electric field is conservative and can be expressed as the negative gradient of a scalar potential $\\phi$: $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$.\nSubstituting these relations into the continuity equation yields:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (-\\sigma \\nabla \\phi) = I \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0)\n$$\nSince the conductivity $\\sigma$ is constant, it can be taken out of the divergence operator:\n$$\n-\\sigma \\nabla^2 \\phi = I \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0)\n$$\nThis gives the governing partial differential equation for the potential $\\phi$, which is Poisson's equation:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\phi(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{I}{\\sigma} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}_0)\n$$\nThe boundary condition at the insulating plane $z=0$ is that no normal current crosses it.

Therefore, the normal component of the current density must be zero:\n$$\nJ_z\\Big|_{z=0} = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\Big|_{z=0} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{J} = -\\sigma \\nabla \\phi = -\\sigma \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial y}\\hat{\\mathbf{j}} + \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}\\right)$, the boundary condition becomes:\n$$\n-\\sigma \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z=0} = 0\n$$\nAs $\\sigma \\ne 0$, we have the Neumann boundary condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}\\Big|_{z=0} = 0\n$$\n\n### Application of the Method of Images\nTo solve Poisson's equation in the half-space $\\{z>0\\}$ subject to the Neumann boundary condition at $z=0$, we use the method of images. This method replaces the boundary with an image source placed in the region $\\{z<0\\}$ such that the superposition of the fields from the real and image sources satisfies the boundary condition.\n\n1.  **Potential in an Unbounded Medium ($\\phi_{\\text{free}}$)**: First, consider the potential from the single point source $I$ at $\\mathbf{r}_{0}=(0,0,d)$ in an infinite homogeneous medium. This is the free-space Green's function for the Laplacian, which is:\n    $$\n    \\phi_{\\text{free}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{I}{4\\pi\\sigma |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_0|}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Image Source Placement**: For a Neumann boundary condition $\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial z}|_{z=0}=0$, an image source of the same polarity and magnitude ($I' = I$) is placed at the mirror-image position of the real source with respect to the boundary plane. The real source is at $\\mathbf{r}_{0}=(0,0,d)$, so the image source is at $\\mathbf{r}'_{0}=(0,0,-d)$.\n\n3.  **Potential with Insulating Boundary ($\\phi_{\\text{ins}}$)**: The potential $\\phi_{\\text{ins}}$ in the conducting region $\\{z>0\\}$ is the superposition of the potentials from the real source and the image source:\n    $$\n    \\phi_{\\text{ins}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{I}{4\\pi\\sigma |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}_0|} + \\frac{I}{4\\pi\\sigma |\\mathbf{r} - \\mathbf{r}'_0|}\n    $$\n    Let the field point be $\\mathbf{r}=(x,y,z)$.

Let the axon run along the $x$-axis, with its closest approach at $(x,y,z) = (0,b,0)$, where $b > 0$.
