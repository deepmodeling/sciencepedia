            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the magnitude ratio, $r$, between the displacement current density, $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$, and the ohmic conduction current density, $\\sigma \\mathbf{E}$, within a homogeneous, isotropic biological tissue. The tissue is driven by a time-harmonic electric field, $\\mathbf{E}(t)$, with a given angular frequency, $\\omega$.\n\nThe foundational relationships provided are:\n1.  The displacement field: $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$\n2.  The ohmic conduction current density: $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{cond}} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}$\n3.  The displacement current density is the time derivative of the displacement field: $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{disp}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$\n\nThe problem considers a time-harmonic electric field $\\mathbf{E}(t)$ with angular frequency $\\omega$. For such fields, it is standard practice to use complex phasor notation to simplify analysis. The electric field can be represented as $\\mathbf{E}(t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}$ is the complex-valued phasor vector, which is constant in time.\n\nUsing this representation, the conduction current density is $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{cond}}(t) = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}(t) = \\Re\\{\\sigma \\hat{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. The corresponding phasor is $\\hat{\\mathbf{J}}_{\\text{cond}} = \\sigma \\hat{\\mathbf{E}}$. The magnitude, or amplitude, of this time-harmonic vector is given by the magnitude of its phasor: $\\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{cond}}\\|_{amp} = |\\hat{\\mathbf{J}}_{\\text{cond}}| = |\\sigma \\hat{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\sigma |\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}|$.\n\nNext, we find the displacement current density. First, the displacement field is $\\mathbf{D}(t) = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}(t) = \\Re\\{\\epsilon \\hat{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. Its phasor is $\\hat{\\mathbf{D}} = \\epsilon \\hat{\\mathbf{E}}$.

The magnitude (amplitude) of this vector is:\n$$\n\\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{disp}}\\|_{amp} = |\\hat{\\mathbf{J}}_{\\text{disp}}| = |i\\omega \\epsilon \\hat{\\mathbf{E}}| = |i||\\omega||\\epsilon||\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\omega \\epsilon |\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}|\n$$\nwhere we have used the fact that $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon$ are positive real numbers and $|i|=1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude ratio $r = \\frac{\\left\\|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}\\right\\|}{\\left\\|\\sigma \\mathbf{E}\\right\\|}$. In the context of time-harmonic fields, this is interpreted as the ratio of the amplitudes of the two vector quantities. This provides a single, time-independent measure of their relative importance.\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{disp}}\\|_{amp}}{\\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{cond}}\\|_{amp}} = \\frac{\\omega \\epsilon |\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}|}{\\sigma |\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}|}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the electric field phasor, $|\\hat{\\mathbf{E}}|$, cancels from the numerator and denominator. This shows that the ratio is independent of the strength of the electric field, as expected. The expression for the ratio simplifies to:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\omega \\epsilon}{\\sigma}\n$$\nThis dimensionless quantity is the standard figure of merit used to assess the validity of the quasistatic approximation (in which displacement currents are neglected).

The sign of $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ is therefore determined by the sign of the term in the parentheses. We now analyze each scenario.\n\n### Scenario Analysis\n\n**Scenario $1$: Apical excitatory synapse**\n- Currents: $I_{a} = -I_{0}$ (sink at apex) and $I_{s} = +I_{0}$ (source at soma).\n- Substituting into the general expression:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{-I_{0}}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{I_{0}}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) = \\frac{I_{0}}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right) $$\n- To determine the sign, we compare the magnitudes of the terms. Since $d > 0$ and $\\epsilon > 0$, we have $d+\\epsilon > \\epsilon$. This implies that $\\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} < \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n- Therefore, the term $\\left( \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right)$ is negative.\n- As $I_{0} > 0$ and $\\sigma > 0$, the potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ is **negative**.\n\n**Scenario $2$: Perisomatic inhibitory synapse**\n- Currents: $I_{s} = +I_{0}$ (source at soma) and $I_{a} = -I_{0}$ (sink at apex).\n- This current configuration is identical to that of Scenario $1$.\n- The calculation is therefore identical:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{-I_{0}}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{I_{0}}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) = \\frac{I_{0}}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} \\right) $$\n- The potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ is **negative**.\n\n**Scenario $3$: Proximal basal excitatory synapse**\n- Currents: $I_{s} = -I_{0}$ (sink at soma) and $I_{a} = +I_{0}$ (source at apex).\n- Substituting into the general expression:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{I_{0}}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{-I_{0}}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) = \\frac{I_{0}}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) $$\n- As established before, $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon} > \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon}$.\n- Therefore, the term $\\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} \\right)$ is positive.\n- As $I_{0} > 0$ and $\\sigma > 0$, the potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ is **positive**.\n\n**Scenario $4$: Distal apical inhibitory synapse**\n- Currents: $I_{a} = +I_{0}$ (source at apex) and $I_{s} = -I_{0}$ (sink at soma).\n- This current configuration is identical to that of Scenario $3$.\n- The calculation is therefore identical:\n$$ \\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{I_{0}}{\\epsilon} + \\frac{-I_{0}}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) = \\frac{I_{0}}{4\\pi \\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - \\frac{1}{d+\\epsilon} \\right) $$\n- The potential $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ is **positive**.\n\nThe crucial insight is that because the electrode is very close to the apical patch ($0 < \\epsilon \\ll d$), the potential it measures is dominated by the current at that patch. The term $\\frac{I_{a}}{\\epsilon}$ has a much larger magnitude than $\\frac{I_{s}}{d+\\epsilon}$, so the sign of $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}_{e})$ follows the sign of $I_{a}$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.

Therefore, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_n^2 = \\int_{f_{\\text{low}}}^{f_{\\text{high}}} S_0 \\, df\n$$\nSince $S_0$ is constant, we can evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\sigma_n^2 = S_0 (f_{\\text{high}} - f_{\\text{low}})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $S_0 = 0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{\\text{low}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n- $f_{\\text{high}} = 40\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n$$\n\\sigma_n^2 = (0.50\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}^{2}/\\mathrm{Hz}) \\times (40\\ \\mathrm{Hz} - 1\\ \\mathrm{Hz}) = 0.50 \\times 39\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}^{2} = 19.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}^{2}\n$$\nThe standard deviation of the noise, $\\sigma_n$, is the square root of the variance:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = \\sqrt{19.5}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}\n$$\n\n**2. SNR for a Single Trial ($N=1$)**\n\nUsing the problem's operational definition, the SNR for a single trial, denoted $\\text{SNR}_1$, is the ratio of the peak signal amplitude to the noise standard deviation:\n$$\n\\text{SNR}_1 = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_n} = \\frac{5.00\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}}{\\sqrt{19.5}\\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{5.00}{\\sqrt{19.5}}\n$$\n\n**3. Effect of Averaging $N$ Trials on SNR**\n\nLet $\\bar{s}_N(t)$ be the signal averaged over $N$ trials:\n$$\n\\bar{s}_N(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (w(t) + n_i(t))\n$$\nBy linearity of summation, this can be separated into signal and noise components:\n$$\n\\bar{s}_N(t) = \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w(t)\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i(t)\\right)\n$$\nThe averaged signal consists of an averaged evoked waveform, $\\bar{w}_N(t)$, and averaged noise, $\\bar{n}_N(t)$.\n\n- **Averaged Evoked Waveform:** Since the evoked waveform $w(t)$ is deterministic and identical for all trials, its average is:\n  $$\n  \\bar{w}_N(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w(t) = \\frac{1}{N} (N \\cdot w(t)) = w(t)\n  $$\n  The peak amplitude of the averaged evoked waveform remains $A_{\\text{peak}}$.\n\n- **Averaged Noise:** The averaged noise is $\\bar{n}_N(t) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i(t)$. We need to find its standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}$. We first find its variance, $\\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}^2 = \\text{Var}(\\bar{n}_N(t))$.\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}^2 = \\text{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i(t)\\right)\n  $$\n  Using the property $\\text{Var}(c X) = c^2 \\text{Var}(X)$, we get:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i(t)\\right)\n  $$\n  Since the noise realizations $n_i(t)$ are independent across trials, the variance of a sum is the sum of the variances:\n  $$\n  \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i(t)\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Var}(n_i(t))\n  $$\n  Furthermore, since the noise is identically distributed, $\\text{Var}(n_i(t)) = \\sigma_n^2$ for all $i$.\n  $$\n  \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\text{Var}(n_i(t)) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma_n^2 = N \\sigma_n^2\n  $$\n  Substituting this back, we find the variance of the averaged noise:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} (N \\sigma_n^2) = \\frac{\\sigma_n^2}{N}\n  $$\n  The standard deviation of the averaged noise is therefore:\n  $$\n  \\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_n^2}{N}} = \\frac{\\sigma_n}{\\sqrt{N}}\n  $$\n\nThe SNR of the averaged signal, $\\text{SNR}_N$, is the ratio of the peak amplitude of the averaged waveform to the standard deviation of the averaged noise:\n$$\n\\text{SNR}_N = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_{\\bar{n}_N}} = \\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_n / \\sqrt{N}} = \\left(\\frac{A_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sigma_n}\\right) \\sqrt{N}\n$$\nThis demonstrates the derived relationship:\n$$\n\\text{SNR}_N = \\text{SNR}_1 \\sqrt{N}\n$$\nThe SNR improves with the square root of the number of trials.\n\n**4. Calculation of the required number of trials $N$**\n\nThe problem requires finding the smallest integer $N$ such that $\\text{SNR}_N \\ge 8.00$.\n$$\n\\text{SNR}_1 \\sqrt{N} \\ge 8.00\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{SNR}_1$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{5.00}{\\sqrt{19.5}}\\right) \\sqrt{N} \\ge 8.00\n$$\nNow, we solve for $N$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{N} \\ge 8.00 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{19.5}}{5.00}\n$$\nSquaring both sides:\n$$\nN \\ge \\left(8.00 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{19.5}}{5.00}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge \\left(\\frac{8.00}{5.00}\\right)^2 \\times 19.5\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge (1.6)^2 \\times 19.5\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge 2.56 \\times 19.5\n$$\n$$\nN \\ge 49.92\n$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this condition. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $49.92$ is $50$.",
