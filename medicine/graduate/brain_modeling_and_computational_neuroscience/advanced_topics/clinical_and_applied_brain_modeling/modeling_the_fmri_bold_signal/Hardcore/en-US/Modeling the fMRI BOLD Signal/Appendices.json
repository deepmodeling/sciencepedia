This is a standard and fundamental modeling approach used across all STEM fields, including computational neuroscience, to approximate the dynamics of complex systems. It represents a simplified, but valid, component of more comprehensive biophysical models of the fMRI BOLD response, such as the Balloon-Windkessel model. The model is scientifically well-established.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is an initial value problem for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients and a well-defined forcing function. An initial condition, $s(t)=0$ for $t<0$, is provided. The non-impulsive input constraint implies continuity of the state variable $s(t)$ at $t=0$, which is sufficient to determine the unique constant of integration. Therefore, the problem is well-posed and admits a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical language and definitions. All terms are objective and free of ambiguity or subjective interpretation.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It provides the governing equation, the input function, all necessary parameters ($\\tau_s, \\kappa$), and the initial state of the system. There are no contradictions.\n- **Realism**: The model is a simplification of a complex biological process, but it is a plausible and widely used abstraction in its domain. The parameters $\\tau_s$ and $\\kappa$ have direct physiological interpretations, which the problem asks to explore.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem is not metaphorical, trivial, tautological, or unverifiable. It is a standard exercise in solving a linear ODE.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires solving the first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{ds(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{s(t)}{\\tau_s} + \\kappa\\, u(t)\n$$\nwith the initial condition $s(t)=0$ for $t<0$ and the input $u(t)=H(t)$.\n\nThe ODE can be rewritten in standard form as:\n$$\n\\frac{ds(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s} s(t) = \\kappa\\, H(t)\n$$\n\nThe solution will be derived for two time domains: $t<0$ and $t \\ge 0$.\n\n**Case 1: $t < 0$**\nFor $t < 0$, $H(t)=0$. The ODE becomes a homogeneous equation:\n$$\n\\frac{ds(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s} s(t) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution is $s(t) = C e^{-t/\\tau_s}$ for some constant $C$. However, the problem explicitly states that $s(t)=0$ for $t<0$. This is consistent with the general solution if we set $C=0$.\n\n**Case 2: $t \\ge 0$**\nFor $t \\ge 0$, $H(t)=1$. The ODE becomes a non-homogeneous equation:\n$$\n\\frac{ds(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s} s(t) = \\kappa\n$$\nThe solution $s(t)$ is the sum of the homogeneous solution $s_h(t)$ and a particular solution $s_p(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous solution, as found before, is $s_h(t) = A e^{-t/\\tau_s}$, where $A$ is a constant of integration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term $\\kappa$ is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution $s_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the ODE gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}(K) + \\frac{1}{\\tau_s} K = \\kappa\n$$\n$$\n0 + \\frac{K}{\\tau_s} = \\kappa \\implies K = \\kappa \\tau_s\n$$\nThus, the particular solution is $s_p(t) = \\kappa \\tau_s$.\n\nThe general solution for $t \\ge 0$ is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$\ns(t) = s_h(t) + s_p(t) = A e^{-t/\\tau_s} + \\kappa \\tau_s\n$$\n\nTo find the constant $A$, we use the initial condition. The problem states that there are no impulsive inputs, which implies that the state variable $s(t)$ must be continuous at $t=0$. Therefore, the value of $s(t)$ as $t$ approaches $0$ from the right ($t \\to 0^{+}$) must equal the value as $t$ approaches $0$ from the left ($t \\to 0^{-}$).\n$$\ns(0) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} s(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^-} s(t)\n$$\nFrom the initial condition for $t<0$, we know $\\lim_{t \\to 0^-} s(t) = 0$. Thus, $s(0) = 0$.\n\nApplying this condition to the general solution for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\ns(0) = A e^{-0/\\tau_s} + \\kappa \\tau_s = A \\cdot 1 + \\kappa \\tau_s = 0\n$$\nSolving for $A$ yields $A = -\\kappa \\tau_s$.\n\nSubstituting this value of $A$ back into the solution for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\ns(t) = -\\kappa \\tau_s e^{-t/\\tau_s} + \\kappa \\tau_s = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_s})\n$$\n\nTo express the solution for all real $t$ in a single expression, we combine the results for $t<0$ and $t \\ge 0$ using the Heaviside function $H(t)$:\n- For $t<0$, $s(t)=0$.\n- For $t \\ge 0$, $s(t) = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_s})$.\n\nThis corresponds to multiplying the solution for $t \\ge 0$ by $H(t)$, which is $0$ for $t<0$ and $1$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe final, unified expression for $s(t)$ is:\n$$\ns(t) = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_s}) H(t)\n$$\n\n### Interpretation of Parameters\nThe problem requires an interpretation of $\\tau_s$ and $\\kappa$.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of $\\kappa$ (Gain)**:\n    The initial rate of change of the signal is its derivative at $t=0^{+}$. From the ODE, with $s(0)=0$ and $u(0^{+})=1$:\n    $$\n    \\dot{s}(0^{+}) = -\\frac{s(0)}{\\tau_s} + \\kappa u(0^{+}) = -\\frac{0}{\\tau_s} + \\kappa(1) = \\kappa\n    $$\n    Thus, $\\kappa$ represents the initial velocity or rate of increase of the vasoactive signal immediately following a step increase in neural input. It is a gain parameter that quantifies the efficacy with which neural activity drives the vascular response. A larger $\\kappa$ implies a more vigorous initial vascular response.\n\n2.  **Interpretation of $\\tau_s$ (Time Constant)** and the steady-state level:\n    As $t \\to \\infty$, the exponential term $e^{-t/\\tau_s}$ approaches $0$. The steady-state value of the signal, $s_{\\infty}$, is:\n    $$\n    s_{\\infty} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} s(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-t/\\tau_s}) \\right] = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - 0) = \\kappa \\tau_s\n    $$\n    The product $\\kappa \\tau_s$ is the maximum amplitude or steady-state level of the vasoactive signal under sustained stimulation.\n    The parameter $\\tau_s$ is the time constant of this exponential approach to steady state. At time $t=\\tau_s$, the signal reaches:\n    $$\n    s(\\tau_s) = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-\\tau_s/\\tau_s}) = \\kappa \\tau_s (1 - e^{-1}) \\approx 0.632\\, s_{\\infty}\n    $$\n    Therefore, $\\tau_s$ is the time it takes for the vasoactive signal to reach approximately $63.2\\%$ of its final steady-state value. It characterizes the sluggishness of the vascular response: a smaller $\\tau_s$ implies a faster response that reaches its maximum level more quickly, while a larger $\\tau_s$ implies a slower, more delayed response.",

We can verify this is an equilibrium point by substituting these values into the equation:\n$$\n\\tau_0\\,\\frac{d(1)}{dt} = 1 - 1^{1/\\alpha} \\implies 0 = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nTo analyze the response to a small perturbation, we linearize the system around this resting state. We define small deviations from the baseline:\n$$\nv(t) = 1 + \\delta v(t)\n$$\n$$\nf_{\\text{in}}(t) = 1 + \\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t)\n$$\nwhere $|\\delta v(t)| \\ll 1$ and $|\\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t)| \\ll 1$.\n\nThe time derivative of $v(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dv(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(1 + \\delta v(t)) = \\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt}\n$$\nThe non-linear outflow term $v(t)^{1/\\alpha}$ is linearized using a first-order Taylor series expansion around $\\delta v = 0$. For a function $g(x) = (1+x)^n$, the expansion is $g(x) \\approx g(0) + g'(0)x$. Here, $x=\\delta v$ and $n=1/\\alpha$, so $g'(\\delta v) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1+\\delta v)^{(1/\\alpha)-1}$. At $\\delta v = 0$, $g(0)=1$ and $g'(0)=\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$. Thus:\n$$\nv(t)^{1/\\alpha} = (1 + \\delta v(t))^{1/\\alpha} \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\delta v(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these linearized expressions back into the original ODE:\n$$\n\\tau_0\\,\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} = \\left(1 + \\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t)\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\delta v(t)\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the equation by canceling the baseline `1` terms:\n$$\n\\tau_0\\,\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} = \\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t) - \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\delta v(t)\n$$\nThis is the linearized equation of motion for the volume perturbation. We can rearrange it into the standard form of a first-order linear time-invariant (LTI) system:\n$$\n\\tau_0\\,\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\delta v(t) = \\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t)\n$$\nTo identify the time constant, we divide by the coefficient of the $\\delta v(t)$ term:\n$$\n(\\alpha\\tau_0)\\,\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} + \\delta v(t) = \\alpha\\,\\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t)\n$$\nA first-order system described by the equation $\\tau \\frac{dy}{dt} + y = Kx(t)$ has a time constant $\\tau$. By comparison, the time constant of the linearized venous volume response, which the problem denotes as $\\tau_v$, is:\n$$\n\\tau_{v} = \\alpha\\tau_0\n$$\nThis is the characteristic lag between flow and volume. Using the given parameter values $\\alpha = 0.4$ and $\\tau_0 = 1.8\\,\\text{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{v} = 0.4 \\times 1.8\\,\\text{s} = 0.72\\,\\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to three significant figures, which is $0.720\\,\\text{s}$.\n\nNext, we compute the steady-state fractional change in volume, $\\Delta v_{\\text{ss}}$. This is the limit of the perturbation $\\delta v(t)$ as $t \\to \\infty$. In the steady state, the system is no longer changing, so the time derivative is zero, $\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} = 0$. The linearized equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\delta v_{\\text{ss}} = \\delta f_{\\text{in, ss}}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta v_{\\text{ss}}$ and $\\delta f_{\\text{in, ss}}$ are the steady-state values of the perturbations. The problem states that for $t \\geq 0$, the inflow has a sustained step increase of $10\\%$. This means the perturbation to the inflow is a constant $\\delta f_{\\text{in}}(t) = 0.1$ for $t \\geq 0$. Therefore, the steady-state input change is $\\delta f_{\\text{in, ss}} = 0.1$.\nSolving for the steady-state volume perturbation:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{\\text{ss}} = \\delta v_{\\text{ss}} = \\alpha \\cdot \\delta f_{\\text{in, ss}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $\\alpha$ and $\\delta f_{\\text{in, ss}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta v_{\\text{ss}} = 0.4 \\times 0.1 = 0.04\n$$\nThe problem requires this result to be rounded to four significant figures, which gives $0.04000$.\n\nFor completeness, the full analytical solution for the step response $\\delta v(t)$ is derived. The ODE for $t \\geq 0$ is:\n$$\n\\tau_{v}\\,\\frac{d(\\delta v)}{dt} + \\delta v(t) = \\alpha \\cdot (0.1)\n$$\nwith the initial condition $\\delta v(0) = 0$, since the system was at rest before the step. The solution to this ODE is of the form:\n$$\n\\delta v(t) = \\delta v_{\\text{ss}}(1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_{v}))\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\delta v_{\\text{ss}}$ and $\\tau_v$:\n$$\n\\delta v(t) = 0.1\\alpha(1 - \\exp(-t/(\\alpha\\tau_0)))\n$$\nThis confirms that the steady-state change as $t \\to \\infty$ is indeed $0.1\\alpha$, and the time constant governing the exponential approach to this new steady state is $\\alpha\\tau_0$. The problem's definition of the lag as the time to reach the fraction $1-1/e$ of the final value is the standard definition of the time constant for such a first-order exponential response.\n\nFinal values to report:\n- Steady-state fractional change: $\\Delta v_{\\text{ss}} = 0.04000$.\n- Characteristic lag: $\\tau_v = 0.720\\,\\text{s}$.\nThe required output is a row matrix $(\\Delta v_{\\text{ss}}, \\tau_{v})$.",

I will proceed with the derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe starting point is the calibrated steady-state BOLD model:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} = M \\left[ 1 - f^{\\alpha - \\beta} r^{\\beta} \\right]\n$$\nThe problem specifies a small-change regime around the baseline state, which is defined by $f=1$ and $r=1$. At baseline, $\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} = M \\left[ 1 - 1^{\\alpha - \\beta} 1^{\\beta} \\right] = 0$, as expected. To analyze small deviations from baseline, we perform a first-order Taylor expansion of the expression for $\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0}$ with respect to the variables $f$ and $r$ around the point $(1, 1)$.\n\nLet $B(f, r) = M \\left[ 1 - f^{\\alpha - \\beta} r^{\\beta} \\right]$. The first-order approximation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} \\approx B(1,1) + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial f}\\bigg|_{(1,1)} (f-1) + \\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{(1,1)} (r-1)\n$$\nAs established, $B(1,1) = 0$. We now compute the partial derivatives.\nThe partial derivative with respect to $f$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial f} = -M r^{\\beta} (\\alpha - \\beta) f^{\\alpha - \\beta - 1}\n$$\nEvaluating at $(f, r) = (1, 1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial f}\\bigg|_{(1,1)} = -M (1)^{\\beta} (\\alpha - \\beta) (1)^{\\alpha - \\beta - 1} = -M(\\alpha - \\beta) = M(\\beta - \\alpha)\n$$\nThe partial derivative with respect to $r$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial r} = -M f^{\\alpha - \\beta} \\beta r^{\\beta - 1}\n$$\nEvaluating at $(f, r) = (1, 1)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial r}\\bigg|_{(1,1)} = -M (1)^{\\alpha - \\beta} \\beta (1)^{\\beta - 1} = -M\\beta\n$$\nSubstituting these partial derivatives into the Taylor expansion, we obtain the linearized BOLD signal change:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} \\approx M(\\beta - \\alpha)(f-1) - M\\beta(r-1) = M \\left[ (\\beta - \\alpha)(f-1) - \\beta(r-1) \\right]\n$$\nNext, we substitute the given linear coupling models for the relative changes $f-1$ and $r-1$.\nThe change in relative CBF, $f-1$, is:\n$$\nf - 1 = g_i \\Delta a_i + g_p \\Delta a_p = g_i (A) + g_p (-\\gamma A) = A(g_i - \\gamma g_p)\n$$\nThe change in relative CMRO$_2$, $r-1$, is:\n$$\nr - 1 = m_i \\Delta a_i + m_p \\Delta a_p = m_i (A) + m_p (-\\gamma A) = A(m_i - \\gamma m_p)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the linearized BOLD equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} \\approx M \\left[ (\\beta - \\alpha) \\left( A(g_i - \\gamma g_p) \\right) - \\beta \\left( A(m_i - \\gamma m_p) \\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} \\approx MA \\left[ (\\beta - \\alpha)(g_i - \\gamma g_p) - \\beta(m_i - \\gamma m_p) \\right]\n$$\nThe condition for a positive BOLD signal change is $\\frac{\\Delta S}{S_0} > 0$. Given that $M > 0$ and $A > 0$, this condition simplifies to:\n$$\n(\\beta - \\alpha)(g_i - \\gamma g_p) - \\beta(m_i - \\gamma m_p) > 0\n$$\nWe must now solve this inequality for $g_i$.\n$$\n(\\beta - \\alpha) g_i - (\\beta - \\alpha)\\gamma g_p - \\beta m_i + \\beta \\gamma m_p > 0\n$$\nIsolating the term containing $g_i$:\n$$\n(\\beta - \\alpha) g_i > (\\beta - \\alpha)\\gamma g_p + \\beta m_i - \\beta \\gamma m_p\n$$\nThe problem states that $\\beta > \\alpha$, which means $\\beta - \\alpha > 0$. We can therefore divide both sides of the inequality by $(\\beta - \\alpha)$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign.\n$$\ng_i > \\frac{(\\beta - \\alpha)\\gamma g_p + \\beta m_i - \\beta \\gamma m_p}{\\beta - \\alpha}\n$$\nThis inequality gives the condition on $g_i$ that must be satisfied for the BOLD signal to be positive. The minimal value of the gain, denoted $g_i^{\\ast}$, is the value that defines the boundary of this condition. Thus, $g_i^{\\ast}$ is equal to the right-hand side of the inequality.\n$$\ng_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{(\\beta - \\alpha)\\gamma g_p + \\beta m_i - \\beta \\gamma m_p}{\\beta - \\alpha}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by separating the terms:\n$$\ng_i^{\\ast} = \\frac{(\\beta - \\alpha)\\gamma g_p}{\\beta - \\alpha} + \\frac{\\beta m_i - \\beta \\gamma m_p}{\\beta - \\alpha}\n$$\n$$\ng_i^{\\ast} = \\gamma g_p + \\frac{\\beta(m_i - \\gamma m_p)}{\\beta - \\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the minimal interneuron vasoactive gain on CBF that guarantees a positive BOLD signal change under the specified conditions. It is expressed as a function of all the required parameters: $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$, $g_p$, $m_i$, and $m_p$.",
