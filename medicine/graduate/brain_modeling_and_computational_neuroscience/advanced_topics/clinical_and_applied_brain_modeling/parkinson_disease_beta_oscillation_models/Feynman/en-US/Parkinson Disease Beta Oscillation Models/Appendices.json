In the brain's complex circuitry, signals take time to travel between regions and be processed at synapses. This practice challenges you to model the entire cortico-basal ganglia loop as a simple delay and an inhibitory signal, using principles from control theory to predict the resulting oscillation frequency $f$. This exercise () provides a powerful first-principles understanding of how loop architecture itself can give rise to pathological rhythms.",

            "problem": "In a minimal lumped model of the cortico–basal ganglia–thalamic loop implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD) beta-band oscillations, approximate the closed-loop dynamics as a single effective sign inversion (due to net inhibitory action along the loop) and a pure time delay. Assume that any additional filtering introduces negligible frequency-dependent phase near the fundamental oscillatory mode, so that the dominant phase contributions are the fixed inversion and the transport delay. The loop comprises an axonal pathway of length $d$ and conduction velocity $v$, and a lumped synaptic/processing delay. Let the total loop delay be $\\tau$. Starting from (i) the definition of transport delay $t_{c} = d/v$ and (ii) the Barkhausen criterion for sustained oscillations in a linear feedback loop (loop phase equal to an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ and loop gain magnitude at least unity), derive an expression for the fundamental oscillation frequency $f$ in terms of $\\tau$. Then, for $v = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, $d = 0.01\\ \\mathrm{m}$, and a synaptic/processing delay of $2\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, evaluate $f$ numerically.

            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part solution: first, a derivation of the fundamental oscillation frequency, and second, its numerical calculation.\n\nThe closed-loop dynamics are modeled as a linear feedback system whose loop transfer function, $L(j\\omega)$, consists of two components: a sign inversion and a pure time delay $\\tau$. The sign inversion corresponds to a multiplication by $-1$. A time delay of $\\tau$ in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by $\\exp(-j\\omega\\tau)$ in the frequency domain, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nThus, the loop transfer function is:\n$$L(j\\omega) = -1 \\cdot \\exp(-j\\omega\\tau) = -\\exp(-j\\omega\\tau)$$\n\nFor sustained oscillations to occur, the Barkhausen criterion must be satisfied. This criterion has two conditions for the loop gain at the oscillation frequency $\\omega$:\n1.  The magnitude of the loop gain must be at least unity: $|L(j\\omega)| \\ge 1$.\n2.  The phase shift around the loop must be an integer multiple of $2\\pi$ radians: $\\angle L(j\\omega) = 2\\pi n$ for some integer $n$.\n\nLet's check these conditions for our model.\nThe magnitude is:\n$$|L(j\\omega)| = |-\\exp(-j\\omega\\tau)| = |-1| \\cdot |\\exp(-j\\omega\\tau)| = 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$\nThe magnitude condition $|L(j\\omega)| \\ge 1$ is met (with equality), so sustained oscillations are possible at any frequency that satisfies the phase condition.\n\nThe phase of the loop transfer function is the sum of the phases of its components. The term $-1$ can be written as $\\exp(j\\pi)$, contributing a phase shift of $\\pi$ radians. The term $\\exp(-j\\omega\\tau)$ contributes a phase shift of $-\\omega\\tau$ radians.\nThe total phase shift is:\n$$\\angle L(j\\omega) = \\pi - \\omega\\tau$$\nApplying the Barkhausen phase criterion:\n$$\\pi - \\omega\\tau = 2\\pi n$$\nwhere $n$ is an integer. We can solve for the possible oscillation frequencies $\\omega$:\n$$\\omega\\tau = \\pi - 2\\pi n = \\pi(1 - 2n)$$\nSince physical angular frequency $\\omega$ and time delay $\\tau$ must be positive, the term $(1 - 2n)$ must be positive.\n$$1 - 2n > 0 \\implies 1 > 2n \\implies n < \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis restricts the integer $n$ to be $n \\in \\{0, -1, -2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nLet's find the corresponding positive frequencies.

The total delay $\\tau$ is the sum of the axonal transport delay, $t_c$, and the synaptic/processing delay, which we'll call $t_s$.\n$$\\tau = t_c + t_s$$\nThe transport delay is given by $t_c = d/v$.\nGiven: $d = 0.01 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $v = 0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n$$t_c = \\frac{0.01 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{0.5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe synaptic/processing delay is given as $t_s = 2 \\ \\mathrm{ms} = 0.002 \\ \\mathrm{s}$.\nThe total delay is:\n$$\\tau = 0.02 \\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.002 \\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.022 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nNow, we can calculate the fundamental frequency $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{2\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 0.022 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{1}{0.044 \\ \\mathrm{s}}$$\n$$f = 22.7272... \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThe problem asks to round the final numerical answer to three significant figures.\n$$f \\approx 22.7 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThis frequency falls within the beta band ($13-30 \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$), which is consistent with the pathological oscillations observed in Parkinson's disease, lending credence to the model's prediction.",

All terms are defined, and the tasks are mathematically precise. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe system of equations can be written in the standard form $\\frac{d}{dt}\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{z}$, where $\\mathbf{z}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ y(t) \\end{pmatrix}$ and the system matrix $\\mathbf{M}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\frac{1}{\\tau}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & b \\\\\na & -1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe temporal evolution of the system is governed by the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{M}$. Oscillatory solutions arise when the eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair.\n\n**1) Derivation of the oscillation frequency $f$**\n\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{M}$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix.\n$$\n\\det\\left( \\begin{pmatrix} -1/\\tau & b/\\tau \\\\ a/\\tau & -1/\\tau \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -1/\\tau - \\lambda & b/\\tau \\\\ a/\\tau & -1/\\tau - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant gives:\n$$\n\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\tau} - \\lambda\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{a}{\\tau}\\right)\\left(\\frac{b}{\\tau}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\lambda + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\right)^2 = \\frac{ab}{\\tau^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$\n\\lambda + \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{ab}{\\tau^2}} = \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{ab}}{\\tau}\n$$\nSolving for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{ab}}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe problem states we are to consider the case where the eigenvalues are complex, which leads to oscillations. Given that $a > 0$ and $b < 0$, their product $ab$ is negative. We can write $b = -|b|$, so $ab = -a|b|$. The square root of this negative number is imaginary:\n$$\n\\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{-a|b|} = i\\sqrt{a|b|}\n$$\nwhere $i$ is the imaginary unit. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -\\frac{1}{\\tau} \\pm i\\frac{\\sqrt{a|b|}}{\\tau}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair of the form $\\lambda = \\sigma \\pm i\\omega$. The real part, $\\sigma = -1/\\tau$, determines the stability of the equilibrium (since $\\tau > 0$, $\\sigma < 0$, indicating a stable spiral or focus). The imaginary part, $\\omega = \\frac{\\sqrt{a|b|}}{\\tau}$, is the angular frequency of the oscillations in radians per unit time.\n\nThe frequency $f$ in Hertz (cycles per second) is related to the angular frequency $\\omega$ by the formula $f = \\omega / (2\\pi)$. Therefore, the expression for the oscillation frequency is:\n$$\nf = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\frac{\\sqrt{a|b|}}{\\tau}\n$$\nSince $|b| = -b$ for $b<0$, the expression can also be written as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\sqrt{a(-b)}}{2\\pi\\tau}\n$$\n\n**2) Calculation of the numerical frequency**\n\nWe are given the parameter values $a = 0.7$, $b = -1.1$, and $\\tau = 12\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. First, we must convert the time constant $\\tau$ to SI units (seconds) to obtain the frequency in Hertz.\n$$\n\\tau = 12\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 12 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 0.012\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $f$. Note that $|b| = |-1.1| = 1.1$.\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.7 \\times 1.1}}{2\\pi \\times 0.012\\,\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\n$$\nf = \\frac{\\sqrt{0.77}}{0.024\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\nf \\approx \\frac{0.8774964}{0.0753982}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} \\approx 11.63816\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nf \\approx 11.6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n\n**3) Qualitative analysis of the effect of $|b|$**\n\nThe derived expression for the frequency is $f = \\frac{\\sqrt{a|b|}}{2\\pi\\tau}$. In this expression, $a$ and $\\tau$ are treated as positive constants. The frequency $f$ is therefore directly proportional to the square root of $|b|$:\n$$\nf \\propto \\sqrt{|b|}\n$$\nThis means that increasing the magnitude of the inhibitory synaptic strength, $|b|$, will cause the value of $\\sqrt{|b|}$ to increase, which in turn leads to an increase in the oscillation frequency $f$.\nThe pathological beta regime is defined as approximately $13$-$30$ Hz. Increasing $|b|$ increases the oscillation frequency $f$. Therefore, if the system is oscillating near or below the lower end of the beta band (as in our numerical example of $11.6$ Hz), increasing $|b|$ will push the frequency upwards, toward and into the beta range. If the system is already oscillating within the beta band, increasing $|b|$ will shift the frequency to a higher value, thus moving it \"deeper\" into the beta regime (i.e., further from the lower boundary and closer to the upper boundary). The statement is therefore correct.",

Parkinsonian Condition**\n\nThe modulated parameters are:\n- $g_{GS, \\text{park}} = 1.20 \\times 80 = 96\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $g_{GG, \\text{park}} = 1.30 \\times 20 = 26\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\nOther parameters like $g_{SS}$, $g_{SG}$, $\\tau_{S}$, and $\\tau_{G}$ remain unchanged.\n\nThe Parkinsonian Jacobian, $J_{\\text{park}}$, is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{park}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 - \\frac{250}{3} & -100 \\\\ 96 & -(50 + 26) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{250}{3} & -100 \\\\ 96 & -76 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace and determinant are:\n$$\n\\text{Tr}(J_{\\text{park}}) = -\\frac{250}{3} - 76 = -\\frac{250+228}{3} = -\\frac{478}{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(J_{\\text{park}}) = \\left(-\\frac{250}{3}\\right)(-76) - (-100)(96) = \\frac{19000}{3} + 9600 = \\frac{19000+28800}{3} = \\frac{47800}{3}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}\n$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda_{\\text{park}}$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{park}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -\\frac{478}{3} \\pm \\sqrt{\\left(-\\frac{478}{3}\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{47800}{3}\\right)} \\right) = -\\frac{239}{3} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{228484}{9} - \\frac{573600}{9}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{park}} = -\\frac{239}{3} \\pm \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{-\\frac{345116}{9}} = -\\frac{239}{3} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{345116}}{6} = -\\frac{239}{3} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{4 \\times 86279}}{6} = -\\frac{239}{3} \\pm i \\frac{\\sqrt{86279}}{3}\n$$\nThe dominant eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}} = -\\frac{239}{3} + i \\frac{\\sqrt{86279}}{3}$.\nNumerically, $\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}} \\approx -79.667 + i\\,97.910$.\n\n**3. Compute Changes**\n\nWe now compute the requested changes between the Parkinsonian and baseline states.\n\n- **Change in the real part of $\\lambda$**:\n$\\Delta \\Re(\\lambda) = \\Re(\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}}) - \\Re(\\lambda_{\\text{base, dom}}) = -\\frac{239}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{230}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{9}{3} = -3.00\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\Delta \\Re(\\lambda) = -3.00$.\n\n- **Change in the imaginary part of $\\lambda$**:\n$\\Delta \\Im(\\lambda) = \\Im(\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}}) - \\Im(\\lambda_{\\text{base, dom}}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{86279}}{3} - \\frac{20\\sqrt{179}}{3} \\approx 97.9104 - 89.1939 = 8.7165\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\Delta \\Im(\\lambda) = 8.72$.\n\n- **Change in frequency $f$**:\nThe frequency $f$ is related to the angular frequency $\\omega = \\Im(\\lambda)$ by $f = \\omega / (2\\pi)$.\nThe change in frequency is $\\Delta f = f_{\\text{park}} - f_{\\text{base}} = \\frac{\\Im(\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}}) - \\Im(\\lambda_{\\text{base, dom}})}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\Delta \\Im(\\lambda)}{2\\pi}$.\n$\\Delta f = \\frac{8.7165}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.3875\\,\\text{Hz}$.\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\Delta f = 1.39$.\n\n- **Change in damping rate $\\gamma$**:\nThe damping rate is defined as $\\gamma = -\\Re(\\lambda)$.\nThe change in damping rate is $\\Delta \\gamma = \\gamma_{\\text{park}} - \\gamma_{\\text{base}} = (-\\Re(\\lambda_{\\text{park, dom}})) - (-\\Re(\\lambda_{\\text{base, dom}})) = -\\Delta \\Re(\\lambda)$.\n$\\Delta \\gamma = -(-3.00) = 3.00\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nRounded to three significant figures, $\\Delta \\gamma = 3.00$.\n\nThe Parkinsonian modulation, as defined in the problem, leads to an increase in oscillation frequency (from approx. $14.2\\,\\text{Hz}$ to $15.6\\,\\text{Hz}$), which is consistent with the emergence of pathological beta-band activity. The real part of the eigenvalue becomes more negative, meaning the system becomes more stable (the damping rate increases). This indicates that this particular parameter modulation in this simplified model does not drive the system towards a Hopf bifurcation (where $\\Re(\\lambda) \\to 0$), but rather stabilizes the equilibrium while increasing the natural oscillation frequency.\n\nThe final values rounded to three significant figures are:\n- $\\Delta \\Re(\\lambda) = -3.00\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta \\Im(\\lambda) = 8.72\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta f = 1.39\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $\\Delta \\gamma = 3.00\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix.",
