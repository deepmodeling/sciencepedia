            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of displacement current density to conduction current density in a conducting medium, a numerical evaluation of this ratio for brain tissue at a specific frequency, and a justification regarding the validity of the quasi-static approximation based on this result.\n\n**Derivation of the Ratio**\nWe begin with the differential form of the Ampère-Maxwell law for a material medium:\n$$ \\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} = \\mathbf{J}_{\\text{free}} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{H}$ is the magnetic field intensity, $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{free}}$ is the free current density, and $\\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement field. The term $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t}$ is defined as the displacement current density, which we denote as $\\mathbf{J}_d$.\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_d = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{D}}{\\partial t} $$\nThe medium is ohmic, so the free current density is the conduction current density, $\\mathbf{J}_c$, given by Ohm's law:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_c = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\\sigma$ is the conductivity.\n\nThe medium is also linear and isotropic, so the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ is related to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ by:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the material.\n\nThe fields are time-harmonic with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. We can represent the time-varying fields using phasor notation. Let the electric field be $\\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\Re\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}(\\mathbf{r}) e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, where $\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$ is the complex phasor for the electric field and $i$ is the imaginary unit. In the frequency domain, the time derivative operator $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is replaced by multiplication by $i\\omega$.\n\nThe phasor for the conduction current density, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_c$, is:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_c = \\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} $$\nThe phasor for the displacement current density, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_d$, is derived from its definition:\n$$ \\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_d = i\\omega \\tilde{\\mathbf{D}} = i\\omega (\\epsilon \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}) = i\\omega\\epsilon \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} $$\nWe are asked for the ratio of the magnitudes of these two current densities. The magnitude of a phasor quantity $\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}$ is $|\\tilde{\\mathbf{Z}}|$.\n\nThe magnitude of the conduction current density is:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_c| = |\\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\sigma |\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| $$\nsince $\\sigma$ is a positive real scalar.\n\nThe magnitude of the displacement current density is:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_d| = |i\\omega\\epsilon \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = |i||\\omega||\\epsilon||\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\omega\\epsilon|\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| $$\nsince $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon$ are positive real scalars.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitude of the displacement current density to the magnitude of the conduction current density is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{|\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_d|}{|\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_c|} = \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon|\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|}{\\sigma|\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|} = \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon}{\\sigma} $$\nThe dependency on the electric field magnitude cancels out, yielding a ratio that depends only on the material properties $\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$ and the angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe now evaluate this ratio using the provided values:\n- $f = 100$ Hz\n- $\\sigma = 0.3$ S/m\n- $\\epsilon_r = 10^5$\n- $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854 \\times 10^{-12}$ F/m\n- $\\pi = 3.14159265$\n\nFirst, we calculate the angular frequency $\\omega$ and the permittivity $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\omega = 2\\pi f = 2 \\times 3.14159265 \\times 100 \\text{ s}^{-1} \\approx 628.31853 \\text{ s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\epsilon = \\epsilon_r \\epsilon_0 = 10^5 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-12} \\text{ F/m}) = 8.854 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/m} $$\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon}{\\sigma} = \\frac{(628.31853 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/m})}{0.3 \\text{ S/m}} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon}{\\sigma} \\approx \\frac{5.5614 \\times 10^{-4}}{0.3} \\approx 1.8538 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe units cancel out, as expected for a ratio of two quantities with the same units (A/m$^2$). Rounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon}{\\sigma} \\approx 1.85 \\times 10^{-3} $$\n\n**Justification of the Quasi-Static Approximation**\nThe quasi-static approximation in electromagnetism is valid when time-varying effects that lead to wave propagation are negligible. For EEG modeling, this approximation simplifies the full set of Maxwell's equations to a much more tractable Poisson-type equation for the scalar electric potential.\n\nA primary condition for this approximation is that the displacement current is negligible compared to the conduction current. From first principles, the Ampère-Maxwell law states that the total current driving the magnetic field is $\\mathbf{J}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathbf{J}_c + \\mathbf{J}_d$. Our derived ratio, $\\frac{|\\mathbf{J}_d|}{|\\mathbf{J}_c|} = \\frac{\\omega\\epsilon}{\\sigma}$, quantitatively compares the contributions of these two currents.\n\nOur calculated value for this ratio at $100$ Hz is $1.85 \\times 10^{-3}$. Since this value is much less than $1$ ($1.85 \\times 10^{-3} \\ll 1$), the magnitude of the displacement current density is less than $0.2\\%$ of the conduction current density. This demonstrates that for EEG frequencies in brain tissue, the material is strongly dominated by conduction rather than dielectric displacement.\n\nTherefore, we can neglect the displacement current term in the Ampère-Maxwell law: $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H} \\approx \\mathbf{J}_c$. Furthermore, it can be shown that under these conditions, the magnetically induced electric fields are also negligible. This allows the electric field to be treated as irrotational ($\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} \\approx 0$), which permits its representation as the gradient of a scalar potential, $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla\\phi$. This is the essence of the quasi-static model used in EEG. The very small value of the ratio provides strong justification for the appropriateness of this approximation.",

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins with the fundamental equations governing electric fields in a conductive medium under the quasi-static approximation.\n\n1.  **Governing Equations**:\n    In a volume conductor, the total current density $\\mathbf{J}$ is the sum of the primary (source) current density $\\mathbf{J}^p$ and the secondary (volume or conduction) current density $\\mathbf{J}^c$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}) + \\mathbf{J}^c(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n    The conservation of charge in the quasi-static limit (where time derivatives of charge density are negligible) requires that the divergence of the total current density is zero:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 $$\n    Substituting the components of $\\mathbf{J}$ gives:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{J}^p + \\mathbf{J}^c) = 0 \\implies \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^c = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p $$\n    The secondary current is driven by the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ according to Ohm's law for a conductive medium with scalar conductivity $\\sigma$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{J}^c = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\n    In the quasi-static approximation, the electric field is conservative and can be expressed as the negative gradient of a scalar potential $V$:\n    $$ \\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla V $$\n    Combining these gives $\\mathbf{J}^c = -\\sigma \\nabla V$. Substituting this into the charge conservation equation yields:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot (-\\sigma \\nabla V) = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p $$\n    For a homogeneous medium, $\\sigma$ is constant, so it can be moved outside the divergence operator:\n    $$ \\sigma \\nabla^2 V = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p \\implies \\nabla^2 V = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p $$\n    This is Poisson's equation for the electric potential $V$ in a homogeneous conductive medium.\n\n2.  **Source Model and Solution**:\n    A point current dipole with moment $\\mathbf{p}$ located at the origin ($\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$) is represented by the primary current density:\n    $$ \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mathbf{p} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n    where $\\delta(\\mathbf{r})$ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. The solution to Poisson's equation $\\nabla^2 V = f$ in an infinite domain is given by the convolution with the Green's function for the Laplacian, $G(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi r}$, where $r=|\\mathbf{r}|$:\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} G(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}') f(\\mathbf{r}') dV' = -\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{1}{4\\pi |\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}')\\right) dV' $$\n    where $\\nabla'$ indicates the gradient with respect to the source coordinates $\\mathbf{r}'$.\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\nabla' \\cdot \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}') dV' $$\n    Using integration by parts (specifically, Green's first identity), this integral can be transformed. The relevant identity is $\\int_V \\phi (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{F}) dV = -\\int_V (\\nabla \\phi) \\cdot \\mathbf{F} dV$ for fields $\\mathbf{F}$ that vanish at infinity. Letting $\\phi = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}$ and $\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}')$:\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = -\\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\left( - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\mathbf{J}^p(\\mathbf{r}') \\cdot \\nabla' \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}\\right) dV' \\right) $$\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} \\left( \\mathbf{p} \\delta(\\mathbf{r}') \\right) \\cdot \\nabla' \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}\\right) dV' $$\n    The gradient term is $\\nabla' \\left(\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|^3}$. Substituting this and using the sifting property of the delta function (evaluating the integrand at $\\mathbf{r}'=\\mathbf{0}$):\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\left[ \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\frac{\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r'}}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|^3} \\right]_{\\mathbf{r'}=\\mathbf{0}} $$\n    This yields the expression for the potential from a current dipole at the origin:\n    $$ V(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\frac{\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}}{r^3} $$\n    where $r = |\\mathbf{r}|$.\n\n3.  **Numerical Calculation**:\n    The problem states that the recording point lies along the axis of the dipole. This implies that the position vector $\\mathbf{r}$ is collinear with the dipole moment vector $\\mathbf{p}$. In this case, the angle $\\theta$ between $\\mathbf{p}$ and $\\mathbf{r}$ is $0$, so the dot product becomes:\n    $$ \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{r} = |\\mathbf{p}| |\\mathbf{r}| \\cos(0) = |\\mathbf{p}| r $$\n    Substituting this into the potential equation simplifies it to:\n    $$ V = \\frac{1}{4\\pi\\sigma} \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}| r}{r^3} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{p}|}{4\\pi\\sigma r^2} $$\n    We are given the values:\n    -   $|\\mathbf{p}|=10^{-8}$ A·m\n    -   $\\sigma=0.3$ S/m\n    -   $r=0.1$ m\n    Plugging these values into the expression:\n    $$ V = \\frac{10^{-8} \\text{ A·m}}{4\\pi(0.3 \\text{ S/m})(0.1 \\text{ m})^2} = \\frac{10^{-8}}{4\\pi(0.3)(0.01)} \\text{ V} $$\n    $$ V = \\frac{10^{-8}}{0.012\\pi} \\text{ V} \\approx 2.65258 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ V} $$\n    To express this in microvolts ($1$ μV = $10^{-6}$ V), we multiply by $10^6$:\n    $$ V \\approx (2.65258 \\times 10^{-7}) \\times 10^6 \\text{ μV} = 0.265258 \\text{ μV} $$\n    Rounding to three significant figures, the potential magnitude is $0.265$ μV.\n\n4.  **Comparison to Typical EEG Amplitudes**:\n    Typical EEG signals measured at the scalp have amplitudes in the range of $10$ μV to $100$ μV. The calculated value of $0.265$ μV is approximately $40$ to $400$ times smaller than these typical scalp potentials. This discrepancy is expected and highlights the limitations of the simplified model used. The primary reasons are:\n    a) **Source Complexity**: Scalp EEG potentials do not arise from a single point source but from the synchronized activity of large populations of neurons, often covering several square centimeters of cortex. The net dipole moment from such a population is significantly larger than the $10^{-8}$ A·m value used here, which is more representative of a very small cortical patch.\n    b) **Volume Conductor Model**: The infinite homogeneous medium is a major simplification. The human head is a heterogeneous structure with layers of differing conductivity (brain, cerebrospinal fluid, skull, scalp). The skull, in particular, has a very low conductivity (it is a strong electrical resistor). While a simple infinite model doesn't capture attenuation from the skull explicitly, a more realistic multi-layer model is needed for accurate amplitude estimation at the scalp. The calculated potential of $\\approx 0.27$ μV is more in line with amplitudes observed in intracranial EEG (iEEG) or electrocorticography (ECoG), where electrodes are placed much closer to the neural sources without the highly resistive skull layer in between.",
