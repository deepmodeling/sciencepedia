Using pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasonography (PW Doppler US), a high-quality spectral envelope of the fetal Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) is obtained in an axial transventricular view, with the insonation angle kept small and constant. The waveform is acquired at a heart rate of 150 beats per minute, corresponding to a cardiac cycle of duration $T$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Doppler ultrasonography and fetal physiology, objective, and well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n1) Definition and Analytical Expressions for Resistive Index (RI) and Pulsatility Index (PI)\n\nThe Resistive Index (RI), also known as Pourcelot's index, and the Pulsatility Index (PI), also known as Gosling's index, are standard dimensionless parameters in Doppler ultrasonography used to characterize blood flow resistance and pulsatility in a downstream vascular bed. Their definitions are based on specific features of the Doppler velocity waveform over a single cardiac cycle.\n\nLet $v(t)$ be the instantaneous maximal velocity as a function of time $t$ over one cardiac cycle of duration $T$. Let $S$ be the peak systolic velocity, which is the maximum value of $v(t)$ during the cycle. Let $D$ be the end-diastolic velocity, which is the value of $v(t)$ at the end of the cardiac cycle (and beginning of the next). The problem also provides the definition of the time-averaged mean velocity, $\\overline{v}$, as:\n$$\n\\overline{v} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v(t)\\,dt\n$$\n\nConceptually, the RI and PI are defined as follows:\n\n- **Resistive Index (RI)**: The RI quantifies the resistance to blood flow. It is defined as the difference between the peak systolic velocity and the end-diastolic velocity, normalized by the peak systolic velocity. This is a measure of the drop in velocity from the peak of the pulse to the end of the cycle, relative to the peak velocity itself.\nThe analytical expression in terms of the specified symbols is:\n$$\n\\text{RI} = \\frac{S - D}{S}\n$$\n\n- **Pulsatility Index (PI)**: The PI quantifies the pulsatility or oscillatory nature of the flow waveform. It is defined as the difference between the peak systolic velocity and the end-diastolic velocity, normalized by the time-averaged mean velocity over the cardiac cycle.\nThe analytical expression in terms of the specified symbols is:\n$$\n\\text{PI} = \\frac{S - D}{\\overline{v}}\n$$\nThese expressions are direct formalizations of the standard clinical definitions of these indices.\n\n2) Computation of Waveform Parameters from Sampled Data\n\nThe problem provides a sequence of $N=11$ velocity samples, $v_i$, taken at equally spaced time points over one complete cardiac cycle. The velocity data is given in units of $\\text{cm}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ as:\n$$\n[\\,18,\\;24,\\;38,\\;50,\\;55,\\;47,\\;34,\\;26,\\;22,\\;20,\\;18\\,]\n$$\nLet these samples be denoted $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_{10}$.\n\nFirst, we identify the peak systolic velocity ($S$) and end-diastolic velocity ($D$) from this dataset.\n- The peak systolic velocity, $S$, is the maximum value in the sequence:\n$$\nS = \\max(v_i) = 55 \\; \\text{cm}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n- The end-diastolic velocity, $D$, is the velocity at the end of the cardiac cycle. For a periodic waveform sampled from the start ($t=0$) to the end ($t=T$) of a cycle, the end-diastolic velocity corresponds to the last sample, $v_{10}$. The first sample, $v_0$, represents the velocity at the start of the cycle, which is physically the same point as the end of the previous cycle. The data confirms this periodicity, as $v_0 = v_{10} = 18$. Thus:\n$$\nD = v_{10} = 18 \\; \\text{cm}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the time-averaged mean velocity, $\\overline{v}$, by applying the composite trapezoidal rule to the $N=11$ samples, which define $n = N-1 = 10$ intervals of equal duration $\\Delta t = T/n$. The integral of $v(t)$ over the period $T$ is approximated as:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} v(t)\\,dt \\approx \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} \\left[ v_0 + 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i + v_n \\right] = \\Delta t \\left[ \\frac{v_0 + v_n}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\overline{v} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t)\\,dt$ and $T=n \\Delta t$, we have:\n$$\n\\overline{v} \\approx \\frac{1}{n \\Delta t} \\left( \\Delta t \\left[ \\frac{v_0 + v_n}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i \\right] \\right) = \\frac{1}{n} \\left[ \\frac{v_0 + v_n}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} v_i \\right]\n$$\nHere, $n=10$, $v_0=18$, and $v_{10}=18$.

All provided principles and parameters are standard and realistic for the specified clinical application.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested by the problem statement. First, we will determine the permissible range for the in-plane resolution $\\Delta$ by considering two competing constraints: the need to resolve fine anatomical features and the need to limit motion-induced blur. Second, we will calculate the required slice thickness $t$ to meet the target signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).\n\n**Part 1: Determination of In-plane Resolution $\\Delta$**\n\nWe begin by establishing the two primary constraints on the in-plane resolution, $\\Delta$. The problem specifies an isotropic in-plane resolution, such that $\\Delta_x = \\Delta_y = \\Delta$.\n\n**Constraint 1: Sampling-Limited Maximum Resolution**\nTo resolve a feature of a given width, the sampling interval must be sufficiently small. According to the Nyquist sampling theorem, to resolve a feature of characteristic width $w$, the sampling interval $\\Delta$ must be no larger than half this width. This establishes the maximum permissible value for $\\Delta$.\n$$ \\Delta \\le \\frac{w}{2} $$\nGiven the cortical sulcal feature width $w = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, we find the maximum allowed pixel size:\n$$ \\Delta \\le \\frac{1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{2} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\le 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nLet this be $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

We can write this relationship as $\\mathrm{SNR} = k\\,\\Delta^2 t$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the system, sequence, and tissue properties.\n\nWe can determine the required slice thickness $t$ by comparing the target acquisition to the reference acquisition.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{target}}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{ref}}} = \\frac{k\\,\\Delta^2 t}{k\\,\\Delta_{x,\\mathrm{ref}}\\,\\Delta_{y,\\mathrm{ref}}\\,t_{\\mathrm{ref}}} $$\nSolving for $t$:\n$$ t = t_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{target}}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\Delta_{x,\\mathrm{ref}}\\,\\Delta_{y,\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\Delta^2} \\right) $$\nWe are given:\n$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{target}} = 20$\n$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 25$\n$t_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$\\Delta_{x,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n$\\Delta_{y,\\mathrm{ref}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n\nFor the target acquisition, we use the unrounded value of $\\Delta^2 = 0.554666...\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$ to maintain precision until the final step.\n$$ t = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}) \\left( \\frac{20}{25} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm})(1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm})}{0.554666...\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2} \\right) $$\n$$ t = (3.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}) (0.8) \\left( \\frac{1}{0.554666...} \\right) $$\n$$ t = \\frac{2.4}{0.554666...}\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ t \\approx 4.32692\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the required slice thickness is:\n$$ t = 4.33\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n\n**Justification of Parameter Choices**\nThe choice of acquisition parameters reflects a critical trade-off in fetal MRI. To resolve fine anatomical details like cortical sulci ($w=1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), high spatial resolution (small $\\Delta$) is necessary, as dictated by the Nyquist criterion ($\\Delta \\le w/2$). However, in single-shot sequences, decreasing $\\Delta$ increases the number of phase-encoding lines required to cover the field of view, thereby prolonging the readout time $T_{\\mathrm{ro}}$. This extended readout makes the acquisition more vulnerable to motion, which manifests as blurring. The constraint $L_{\\mathrm{blur}} \\le \\beta\\Delta$ quantifies this limitation, establishing a minimum permissible value for $\\Delta$. The calculated feasible range for $\\Delta$ ($[0.745\\,\\mathrm{mm}, 0.75\\,\\mathrm{mm}]$) is extremely narrow, highlighting the tight constraints of this imaging problem. Selecting the smallest possible $\\Delta$ in this range ($0.745\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is the optimal strategy, as it maximizes spatial resolution up to the absolute limit imposed by motion blur. The corresponding increase in slice thickness to $4.33\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is a necessary compromise to recover the SNR lost due to the smaller in-plane voxel area, ensuring the final image is not overly noisy.",

Repeated measurements performed by two experienced operators yield sample standard deviations $\\sigma_B$ and $\\sigma_C$ for $B$ and $C$, respectively, and a measured correlation coefficient $\\rho$ between $B$ and $C$ attributable to common acquisition factors (e.g., overall zoom, maternal habitus, fetal motion).

If errors in $B$ and $C$ are positively correlated due to common multiplicative scaling (e.g., same zoom or speed-of-sound assumption), the covariance term reduces $\\mathrm{Var}(R)$. Acquiring $B$ and $C$ in the same frame and zoom setting increases this correlation and can decrease propagated error in $R$.\n\nC. Measuring $B$ in a midsagittal ultrasound plane and $C$ in a separate axial plane invariably increases ratio accuracy by avoiding compounded foreshortening; cross-plane acquisition is therefore preferred to minimize error.\n\nD. In fetal MRI, using thicker slices reduces noise and partial volume effects and therefore decreases both bias and variance in $R$.\n\nE.

Under small independent errors, the relative standard deviation of $R$ approximates $\\sqrt{(\\sigma_B/B)^2 + (\\sigma_C/C)^2}$; therefore, ratios can exhibit larger relative uncertainty than either component alone when both component relative errors are non-negligible.\nIndependent errors imply $\\rho=0$. Our derived formula for the relative variance of $R$ is $(\\sigma_R/R)^2 \\approx (\\sigma_B/B)^2 + (\\sigma_C/C)^2 - 2\\rho(\\sigma_B/B)(\\sigma_C/C)$. Setting $\\rho=0$ gives $(\\sigma_R/R)^2 \\approx (\\sigma_B/B)^2 + (\\sigma_C/C)^2$. Taking the square root, the relative standard deviation (or coefficient of variation) is $\\sigma_R/R \\approx \\sqrt{(\\sigma_B/B)^2 + (\\sigma_C/C)^2}$. This is the standard formula for quadrature addition of relative errors. The first part is correct. For the second part, let $\\mathrm{CV}_R = \\sigma_R/R$, $\\mathrm{CV}_B = \\sigma_B/B$, and $\\mathrm{CV}_C = \\sigma_C/C$. The equation is $\\mathrm{CV}_R^2 \\approx \\mathrm{CV}_B^2 + \\mathrm{CV}_C^2$. Since squares of non-zero real numbers are positive, if $\\mathrm{CV}_B$ and $\\mathrm{CV}_C$ are non-negligible, then $\\mathrm{CV}_R^2 > \\mathrm{CV}_B^2$ and $\\mathrm{CV}_R^2 > \\mathrm{CV}_C^2$, which implies $\\mathrm{CV}_R > \\mathrm{CV}_B$ and $\\mathrm{CV}_R > \\mathrm{CV}_C$. Thus, the relative error of the ratio is indeed greater than the relative error of each component.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. If errors in $B$ and $C$ are positively correlated due to common multiplicative scaling (e.g., same zoom or speed-of-sound assumption), the covariance term reduces $\\mathrm{Var}(R)$. Acquiring $B$ and $C$ in the same frame and zoom setting increases this correlation and can decrease propagated error in $R$.\nThe covariance term in the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(R)$ is $-2\\rho(\\frac{B}{C^3})\\sigma_B\\sigma_C$. In the relative variance formula, it is $-2\\rho(\\mathrm{CV}_B)(\\mathrm{CV}_C)$. If the correlation is positive ($\\rho > 0$), this term is negative, thus reducing the total variance compared to the case of independent errors. Common multiplicative errors (like a zoom factor) will cause $B$ and $C$ to be overestimated or underestimated together, leading to a strong positive correlation ($\\rho \\to 1$). Maximizing this positive correlation (e.g., by using the same acquisition settings) makes the negative covariance term larger in magnitude, leading to a maximal reduction in the variance of the ratio. This phenomenon is known as \"common-mode rejection\" for ratios.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Measuring $B$ in a midsagittal ultrasound plane and C in a separate axial plane invariably increases ratio accuracy by avoiding compounded foreshortening; cross-plane acquisition is therefore preferred to minimize error.\nThis statement confuses accuracy (related to bias) and precision (related to variance). While measuring $B$ and $C$ in their respective optimal anatomical planes is standard practice to minimize measurement bias (e.g., from foreshortening), this method of separate acquisitions will likely decorrelate the measurement errors (i.e., $\\rho \\approx 0$). As shown in the analysis of option B, a lower correlation $\\rho$ *increases* the propagated variance of the ratio. Therefore, there is a trade-off between reducing bias in the individual components and minimizing the variance of the ratio. The claim that this method \"invariably increases ratio accuracy\" is too strong and ignores the effect on variance. It is not therefore always \"preferred to minimize error,\" as total error is a combination of bias and variance.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. In fetal MRI, using thicker slices reduces noise and partial volume effects and therefore decreases both bias and variance in $R$.\nUsing thicker slices increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by increasing the voxel volume, which generally reduces random measurement error (variance). However, thicker slices *increase*, not reduce, partial volume effects (PVE). PVE occurs when a voxel contains a boundary between different tissues, averaging their signals. This effect blurs anatomical edges and is a major source of systematic measurement error (bias), particularly for small structures. To minimize PVE and thus bias, one must use *thin* slices. The premise that thicker slices reduce PVE is factually wrong.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Repeating each measurement $n$ times and averaging reduces the standard deviation of each component by approximately $1/\\sqrt{n}$, thereby decreasing $\\sigma_R$ via propagation; combining repetition with motion-robust sequences (e.g., single-shot fast spin-echo) and isotropic resolution can minimize compounded measurement error.\nThis statement combines several correct principles. The standard error of the mean dictates that the standard deviation of an average of $n$ independent measurements is the original standard deviation divided by $\\sqrt{n}$. Reducing the component standard deviations ($\\sigma_B$ and $\\sigma_C$) will, according to the propagation of uncertainty formula, reduce the final standard deviation of the ratio, $\\sigma_R$. The second part of the statement correctly identifies practical MRI techniques for minimizing measurement error: motion-robust sequences (like SSFSE) are essential to mitigate fetal motion artifacts, and isotropic resolution allows for accurate multi-planar reformation to find the true measurement planes, reducing operator-dependent bias. This is a comprehensive and correct strategy for error reduction.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nF. Normalizing both $B$ and $C$ by head circumference $H$ (i.e., forming $B/H$ and $C/H$) necessarily eliminates multiplicative scaling and reduces error in $R$, because introducing $H$ cancels all systematic biases.\nThe ratio of the normalized components is $(B/H) / (C/H) = B/C = R$. The quantity itself is unchanged. The original ratio $R=B/C$ is already insensitive to any common multiplicative scaling error that affects both $B$ and $C$ equally. Introducing a third measurement, head circumference ($H$), which has its own measurement uncertainty, does not simplify the problem; it complicates the error analysis by introducing $\\sigma_H$ and its covariances with $B$ and $C$. It is not guaranteed to reduce the error in $R$. Most importantly, the claim that this procedure \"cancels all systematic biases\" is a gross overstatement. It would not affect additive biases, biases from planar misalignment (foreshortening), or any bias unique to the measurement of $H$ itself.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
