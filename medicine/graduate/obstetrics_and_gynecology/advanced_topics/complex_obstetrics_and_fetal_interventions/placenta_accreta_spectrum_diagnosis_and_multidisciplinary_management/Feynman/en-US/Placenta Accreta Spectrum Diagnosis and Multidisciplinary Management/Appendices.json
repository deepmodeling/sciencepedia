            "problem": "Consider placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), defined as abnormal adherence of the placenta to the myometrium ranging from placenta accreta to increta and percreta. In epidemiologic terms, the risk of an outcome is the probability of that outcome in a defined population over a specified interval, and the relative risk is the ratio of the risk in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. Among pregnant individuals with placenta previa, widely cited clinical estimates report the probability of PAS to be $11\\%$ when there is one prior cesarean delivery and $3\\%$ when there is no prior cesarean delivery. Treat these estimates as the risks in the exposed group (placenta previa with one prior cesarean) and the unexposed group (placenta previa with no prior cesarean), respectively. Using foundational epidemiologic definitions only, compute the relative risk of PAS associated with having one prior cesarean compared with having no prior cesarean among patients with placenta previa. Express your final answer as a dimensionless number and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the relative risk of placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) associated with a history of one prior cesarean delivery compared to no prior cesarean delivery, specifically within the subpopulation of pregnant individuals with placenta previa. The solution will be derived directly from the foundational epidemiologic definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, let us formalize the given information. The problem defines the following quantities:\n- The exposed group consists of pregnant individuals with placenta previa and one prior cesarean delivery.\n- The unexposed group consists of pregnant individuals with placenta previa and no prior cesarean delivery.\n- The outcome of interest is the diagnosis of PAS.\n\nThe risk of an outcome is stated to be the probability of that outcome occurring in a defined population. Let $R_{exposed}$ denote the risk of PAS in the exposed group, and $R_{unexposed}$ denote the risk of PAS in the unexposed group.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the probability of PAS in the exposed group is given as $11\\%$. Therefore, we can write the risk for the exposed group as a dimensionless probability:\n$$R_{exposed} = 11\\% = \\frac{11}{100} = 0.11$$\n\nSimilarly, the probability of PAS in the unexposed group is given as $3\\%$. The risk for the unexposed group is:\n$$R_{unexposed} = 3\\% = \\frac{3}{100} = 0.03$$\n\nThe problem defines the relative risk, denoted as $RR$, as the ratio of the risk in an exposed group to the risk in an unexposed group. The formula is:\n$$RR = \\frac{R_{exposed}}{R_{unexposed}}$$\n\nSubstituting the given risk values into this formula, we get:\n$$RR = \\frac{0.11}{0.03}$$\n\nThis is equivalent to the fraction:\n$$RR = \\frac{11}{3}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this fraction:\n$$RR = 3.666...$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $3.666...$ has a first significant figure of $3$, a second of $6$, and a third of $6$. The fourth digit is $6$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we must round up the third significant figure.\n\nRounding $3.666...$ to three significant figures gives:\n$$RR \\approx 3.67$$\n\nThis value is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of two probabilities, which are themselves dimensionless quantities.",

The value $\\text{NPV} \\approx 0.9942$ signifies that for a patient in this moderate-risk cohort who receives a negative result from the specialized test, there is a $0.9942$ probability that she is truly free of placenta accreta spectrum. This high probability indicates that a negative test result is very effective at ruling out the condition. This quantitative evidence strongly supports a clinical decision to de-escalate care, i.e., to discharge the patient from a specialized, high-resource placenta accreta spectrum pathway to standard obstetric care. However, the test is not perfect, and a residual risk remains. The probability that a patient with a negative test result nonetheless has the disease (a false negative) is given by the false omission rate, $\\text{FOR} = \\mathbb{P}(D \\mid T^{-}) = 1 - \\text{NPV}$.

The clinical decision to discharge must weigh the substantial reassurance provided by the negative test against this small but clinically significant residual risk, especially given the severe morbidity associated with an undiagnosed case of placenta accreta spectrum.",

            "problem": "A patient with placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) is scheduled for a planned cesarean hysterectomy at a tertiary center with a multidisciplinary team. In PAS, peripartum hemorrhage risk is high, and preoperative planning includes estimating maternal blood volume and pre-arranging adequate packed red blood cell (PRBC) units. Use the following foundational facts:\n\n- Maternal blood volume in late pregnancy scales approximately linearly with body mass, with a proportionality constant of $70\\ \\mathrm{mL/kg}$.\n- For high-risk PAS, a conservative planning threshold is to prepare for replacement of $150\\%$ of the estimated blood volume.\n- A typical PRBC unit has an average volume of $300\\ \\mathrm{mL}$.\n\nA patient weighs $75\\ \\mathrm{kg}$.
