This exercise  walks you through deriving the probability of an autosomal recessive condition, sickle cell disease, from first principles. By applying Mendel's law of segregation to two carrier parents, you will solidify your understanding of how alleles are transmitted and how these probabilities combine to determine offspring genotypes.",

            "problem": "A couple presents for preconception counseling. Hemoglobin electrophoresis confirms that the mother has sickle cell trait and is heterozygous for the hemoglobin beta gene with genotype $\\mathrm{HbAS}$, and the father also has sickle cell trait with genotype $\\mathrm{HbAS}$. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is caused by homozygosity for the hemoglobin S allele at the hemoglobin beta locus ($\\mathrm{HbSS}$) and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Assume classical Mendelian segregation during meiosis (equal segregation of alleles per Mendel’s first law), no segregation distortion, no de novo mutation, and independence of gamete formation between parents. Using these assumptions as the fundamental base, derive from first principles the expected genotype proportions among their offspring for $\\mathrm{HbAA}$, $\\mathrm{HbAS}$, and $\\mathrm{HbSS}$, and compute the probability that a randomly conceived fetus will have SCD (i.e., genotype $\\mathrm{HbSS}$). Express the final probability as a fraction in simplest form. Do not use shortcut formulas stated without derivation. The final reported answer must be only the probability as a single fraction; do not include units or a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "Let the allele for normal hemoglobin be denoted by $A$ ($\\mathrm{HbA}$) and the allele for sickle hemoglobin be denoted by $S$ ($\\mathrm{HbS}$). The problem states that both the mother and the father are heterozygous, with the genotype $\\mathrm{HbAS}$. This can be represented as the genotype $AS$. Sickle cell disease (SCD) corresponds to the homozygous recessive genotype $\\mathrm{HbSS}$, or $SS$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principles of Mendelian genetics, specifically Mendel's first law (the law of segregation).\n\nFirst, we determine the possible gametes produced by each parent and their respective probabilities. The law of segregation states that during meiosis, the two alleles for a trait separate (segregate) from each other, so that each gamete receives only one of the two alleles. The problem specifies no segregation distortion, which means each allele has an equal probability of being passed on to a gamete.\n\nFor the mother, with genotype $AS$, she can produce two types of gametes: those carrying the $A$ allele and those carrying the $S$ allele. The probabilities are:\n- Probability of a maternal gamete carrying allele $A$: $P(\\text{maternal gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of a maternal gamete carrying allele $S$: $P(\\text{maternal gamete}=S) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nSimilarly, for the father, who also has the genotype $AS$, the probabilities of his gametes carrying each allele are identical:\n- Probability of a paternal gamete carrying allele $A$: $P(\\text{paternal gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n- Probability of a paternal gamete carrying allele $S$: $P(\\text{paternal gamete}=S) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nNext, we determine the probabilities of the possible genotypes of the offspring. The formation of an offspring's genotype results from the random combination of one maternal gamete and one paternal gamete. The problem states we can assume independence, which means the allele inherited from the mother is independent of the allele inherited from the father. Therefore, the probability of any specific offspring genotype is the product of the probabilities of receiving the constituent alleles from each parent.\n\nWe can now calculate the probability for each of the three possible genotypes ($\\mathrm{HbAA}$, $\\mathrm{HbAS}$, $\\mathrm{HbSS}$):\n\n1.  **Genotype $\\mathrm{HbAA}$ (or $AA$):**\n    This genotype occurs when the offspring inherits an $A$ allele from the mother and an $A$ allele from the father. The probability is:\n    $$P(AA) = P(\\text{maternal gamete}=A) \\times P(\\text{paternal gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\n2.  **Genotype $\\mathrm{HbAS}$ (or $AS$):**\n    This heterozygous genotype can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n    a) The offspring inherits an $A$ allele from the mother and an $S$ allele from the father. The probability of this event is:\n    $$P(A_{\\text{mother}}, S_{\\text{father}}) = P(\\text{maternal gamete}=A) \\times P(\\text{paternal gamete}=S) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n    b) The offspring inherits an $S$ allele from the mother and an $A$ allele from the father. The probability of this event is:\n    $$P(S_{\\text{mother}}, A_{\\text{father}}) = P(\\text{maternal gamete}=S) \\times P(\\text{paternal gamete}=A) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n    Since these are mutually exclusive events, the total probability of having the genotype $AS$ is the sum of their probabilities:\n    $$P(AS) = P(A_{\\text{mother}}, S_{\\text{father}}) + P(S_{\\text{mother}}, A_{\\text{father}}) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{2}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n3.  **Genotype $\\mathrm{HbSS}$ (or $SS$):**\n    This genotype, which corresponds to sickle cell disease (SCD), occurs when the offspring inherits an $S$ allele from the mother and an $S$ allele from the father. The probability is:\n    $$P(SS) = P(\\text{maternal gamete}=S) \\times P(\\text{paternal gamete}=S) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$$\n\nThe expected genotype proportions among the offspring are therefore:\n- $\\mathrm{HbAA}$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n- $\\mathrm{HbAS}$: $\\frac{1}{2}$\n- $\\mathrm{HbSS}$: $\\frac{1}{4}$\n\nAs a verification, the sum of these probabilities is $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$, which accounts for all possible outcomes.\n\nThe problem asks specifically for the probability that a randomly conceived fetus will have SCD. This corresponds to the genotype $\\mathrm{HbSS}$. Based on our derivation from first principles, this probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$.",

            "introduction": "Genetic counseling often involves navigating complexities beyond simple inheritance patterns. This practice problem  introduces the crucial concept of incomplete penetrance, where inheriting a pathogenic allele does not guarantee expression of the disorder. You will calculate the clinical risk for a child when a parent has an autosomal dominant condition with a known penetrance of $p=0.8$, learning how to correctly modify the baseline $0.5$ transmission risk.",

            "problem": "A couple presents for preconception counseling. One partner is clinically affected by a known autosomal dominant disorder and is confirmed heterozygous for a pathogenic variant, denoted by genotype $A a$ where $A$ is the pathogenic allele and $a$ is the reference allele. The other partner is unaffected with genotype $a a$ and has no family history. For this disorder, the penetrance—the conditional probability that an individual carrying at least one $A$ allele will manifest the clinical phenotype by childhood—is $p=0.8$. Assume the following: (i) classical Mendelian segregation applies in meiosis, (ii) the disorder shows no phenocopies in the absence of the pathogenic allele by childhood, so $P(\\text{affected}\\mid a a)=0$, and (iii) the probability of a de novo pathogenic variant in the $a a$ child is negligible in this clinical context.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of Mendelian transmission and penetrance, derive from first principles the probability that a randomly conceived child of this couple will be clinically affected by childhood. In your derivation, make clear how the concept of penetrance modifies the usual $0.5$ expectation associated with autosomal dominant transmission from a heterozygous parent.

            "solution": "Let the event that a child is clinically affected by the disorder be denoted by $E_{\\text{affected}}$. We are asked to find the probability $P(E_{\\text{affected}})$.\n\nThe parents' genotypes are given as $A a$ and $a a$. According to the principle of Mendelian segregation, the heterozygous parent ($A a$) will transmit either the $A$ allele or the $a$ allele to an offspring, each with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. The homozygous parent ($a a$) will always transmit the $a$ allele, with a probability of $1$.\n\nWe can determine the probabilities of the possible genotypes for a child of this couple:\n1.  The probability of inheriting the $A a$ genotype, $P(G_{Aa})$, is the probability of receiving the $A$ allele from the affected parent ($\\frac{1}{2}$) and the $a$ allele from the unaffected parent ($1$).\n    $$P(G_{Aa}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n2.

This is precisely the definition of penetrance for an individual carrying the pathogenic allele. The problem states this value is $p=0.8$.\n-   $P(E_{\\text{affected}} | G_{aa})$ is the conditional probability of being affected given that the genotype is $a a$. The problem states that there are no phenocopies, which means $P(\\text{affected}\\mid a a)=0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the total probability formula:\n$$P(E_{\\text{affected}}) = (p) \\times P(G_{Aa}) + (0) \\times P(G_{aa})$$\n$$P(E_{\\text{affected}}) = (0.8) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + (0) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)$$\n$$P(E_{\\text{affected}}) = 0.4 + 0$$\n$$P(E_{\\text{affected}}) = 0.4$$\n\nThe concept of penetrance modifies the usual expectation associated with autosomal dominant transmission. The overall risk is the product of two probabilities: the probability of inheriting the pathogenic allele and the conditional probability of the phenotype manifesting given the presence of the allele.\n\nThus, the probability of being affected is the Mendelian risk of inheritance, $\\frac{1}{2}$, multiplied by the penetrance, $p$:\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = P(\\text{inheriting } A \\text{ allele}) \\times P(\\text{affected} | \\text{has } A \\text{ allele})$$\n$$P(\\text{affected}) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times p = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\times 0.8 = 0.4$$\nThe final probability that a randomly conceived child will be clinically affected is $0.4$.",

The derivation will be based on the odds-likelihood ratio formulation of Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between post-test odds, pre-test odds, and the likelihood ratio, starting from the fundamental statement of Bayes' theorem. For an event $D$ and evidence $T$, Bayes' theorem is:\n$$p(D \\mid T) = \\frac{p(T \\mid D) p(D)}{p(T)}$$\nThe probability of the complementary event, $\\neg D$ (the fetus does not have T21), given the same evidence is:\n$$p(\\neg D \\mid T) = \\frac{p(T \\mid \\neg D) p(\\neg D)}{p(T)}$$\nThe post-test odds, $O(D \\mid T)$, are defined as the ratio of these two posterior probabilities:\n$$O(D \\mid T) = \\frac{p(D \\mid T)}{p(\\neg D \\mid T)} = \\frac{p(T \\mid D) p(D) / p(T)}{p(T \\mid \\neg D) p(\\neg D) / p(T)} = \\frac{p(T \\mid D) p(D)}{p(T \\mid \\neg D) p(\\neg D)}$$\nThis expression can be factored into two meaningful parts:\n$$O(D \\mid T) = \\left( \\frac{p(D)}{p(\\neg D)} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{p(T \\mid D)}{p(T \\mid \\neg D)} \\right)$$\nThe first term is the pre-test (or prior) odds of the event $D$:\n$$O(D) = \\frac{p(D)}{1 - p(D)} = \\frac{p(D)}{p(\\neg D)}$$\nThe second term is the likelihood ratio ($\\mathrm{LR}$) of the evidence $T$:\n$$\\mathrm{LR}(T) = \\frac{p(T \\mid D)}{p(T \\mid \\neg D)}$$\nBy substitution, we derive the odds form of Bayes' theorem:\n$$O(D \\mid T) = O(D) \\times \\mathrm{LR}(T)$$\nThis formulation is particularly useful when combining evidence from multiple independent sources.
