To quantify the risk of occult uterine sarcoma and inform perioperative strategy (including avoidance of uncontained morcellation), they will use Bayes’ theorem grounded in fundamental probability definitions. The institutional pretest prevalence for occult uterine sarcoma in this specific operative cohort is $p_{0} = 0.0015$. Preoperative assessment yields the following independent features:\n- Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diffusion-weighted imaging shows marked diffusion restriction, with a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of $\\text{LR}_{1}^{+} = 8$ when present.\n- Contrast-enhanced MRI shows non-enhancing central necrosis, with a positive likelihood ratio of $\\text{LR}_{2}^{+} = 5$ when present.\n- Transvaginal ultrasound with power Doppler demonstrates chaotic, high-velocity intratumoral flow, with a positive likelihood ratio of $\\text{LR}_{3}^{+} = 3$ when present.\n- Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isoenzyme elevation is absent, with a negative likelihood ratio of $\\text{LR}_{4}^{-} = 0.6$ when absent.\n\nAssume conditional independence of these features given disease and given no disease, and that all three imaging features are present while LDH elevation is absent. Using Bayes’ theorem from the base definitions of conditional probability and odds, evaluate the post-test probability $p_{1}$ that the mass represents occult uterine sarcoma for this patient.

To prevent thermal injury to the ureter, the operative team specifies a maximum allowable ureter temperature of $T_{\\mathrm{inj}} = 50\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and a baseline tissue temperature of $T_b = 37\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Assume tissue is homogeneous and isotropic, and that heat transfer in the perfused pelvic tissue can be modeled by the steady-state Pennes bioheat equation, where perfusion is represented by a volumetric sink proportional to $(T - T_b)$.
