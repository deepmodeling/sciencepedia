            "problem": "A simplified but scientifically grounded risk model for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) in singleton pregnancies can be constructed by appealing to the observed maternal-age effect on meiotic nondisjunction. Empirically, the probability of trisomy 21 at term increases with maternal age, and a useful first approximation for advanced maternal ages is to model the age effect as a constant annual multiplicative change in risk. Let $p_{a}$ denote the probability of trisomy 21 at term for a mother aged $a$ years. Assume that:\n1. The baseline probability at age $35$ years is $p_{35}$.\n2. The relative change in risk from one year to the next is constant and equal to a factor $\\alpha>1$, such that the risk at age $a+1$ is $\\alpha$ times the risk at age $a$.\n3. The annual multiplicative changes compound over successive years and the probabilities remain sufficiently small ($p_{a} \\ll 1$) so that modeling on the risk scale is a reasonable approximation to more complex odds-scale models at advanced reproductive ages.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting only from the above definitions and empirical observation that the annual risk ratio is approximately constant in the advanced maternal age range, derive the expression for $p_{40}$ in terms of $p_{35}$ and $\\alpha$ by logically composing annual changes over five years. Then, given $p_{35}=\\frac{1}{300}$ and $\\alpha=1.25$, compute the numerical value of $p_{40}$. Express your final answer as a decimal fraction, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a simplified but valid epidemiological model for the maternal-age dependence of trisomy 21 risk. The parameters provided are reasonable and the task is clearly defined. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem defines the probability of trisomy 21 at term for a mother of age $a$ as $p_a$. The core of the model is the recursive relationship describing the annual change in this probability. For a mother at age $a$, the probability is $p_a$. For a mother at age $a+1$, the probability $p_{a+1}$ is given by a constant multiplicative factor $\\alpha$ applied to the previous year's probability. This can be expressed as:\n$$p_{a+1} = \\alpha \\cdot p_a$$\nThis relationship is stated to hold for advanced maternal ages, and we are given a baseline probability at age $a=35$, which is $p_{35}$. The task is to determine the probability at age $a=40$, denoted $p_{40}$, by compounding this annual change over the intervening years.\n\nWe begin with the known probability at age $35$, $p_{35}$, and apply the recursive formula iteratively.\n\nThe probability at age $36$ is found by applying the formula for $a=35$:\n$$p_{36} = \\alpha \\cdot p_{35}$$\n\nThe probability at age $37$ is found by applying the formula for $a=36$:\n$$p_{37} = \\alpha \\cdot p_{36}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{36}$, we get:\n$$p_{37} = \\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha \\cdot p_{35}) = \\alpha^2 \\cdot p_{35}$$\n\nThe probability at age $38$ is found by applying the formula for $a=37$:\n$$p_{38} = \\alpha \\cdot p_{37}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{37}$:\n$$p_{38} = \\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha^2 \\cdot p_{35}) = \\alpha^3 \\cdot p_{35}$$\n\nThe probability at age $39$ is found by applying the formula for $a=38$:\n$$p_{39} = \\alpha \\cdot p_{38}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{38}$:\n$$p_{39} = \\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha^3 \\cdot p_{35}) = \\alpha^4 \\cdot p_{35}$$\n\nFinally, the probability at age $40$ is found by applying the formula for $a=39$:\n$$p_{40} = \\alpha \\cdot p_{39}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{39}$:\n$$p_{40} = \\alpha \\cdot (\\alpha^4 \\cdot p_{35}) = \\alpha^5 \\cdot p_{35}$$\n\nThis is the general expression for $p_{40}$ in terms of $p_{35}$ and $\\alpha$. This formula represents the compounding of the annual risk increase over the $5$-year interval from age $35$ to age $40$.\n\nThe problem now requires the computation of the numerical value of $p_{40}$ given the specific values $p_{35} = \\frac{1}{300}$ and $\\alpha = 1.25$. We substitute these values into our derived expression:\n$$p_{40} = (1.25)^5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{300}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the fifth power of $1.25$. It is often computationally simpler to work with fractions. The value $1.25$ is equivalent to the fraction $\\frac{5}{4}$.\n$$(1.25)^5 = \\left(\\frac{5}{4}\\right)^5 = \\frac{5^5}{4^5} = \\frac{3125}{1024}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this fraction back into the expression for $p_{40}$:\n$$p_{40} = \\frac{3125}{1024} \\cdot \\frac{1}{300}$$\n$$p_{40} = \\frac{3125}{1024 \\times 300} = \\frac{3125}{307200}$$\n\nTo obtain the final answer, we must convert this fraction to a decimal and round to four significant figures.\n$$p_{40} = \\frac{3125}{307200} \\approx 0.0101725097...$$\n\nThe first significant figure is $1$ (in the hundredths place). The first four significant figures are $1$, $0$, $1$, $7$. The fifth significant figure is $2$. Since $2  5$, we round down, which means we truncate the decimal expression after the fourth significant figure.\n$$p_{40} \\approx 0.01017$$\nThis numerical result represents the estimated probability of trisomy 21 at term for a mother aged $40$ years under the assumptions of the model.",

It provides all necessary empirical data and clear definitions to calculate the required ratio. The data are internally consistent and biologically plausible.\n\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the maternal-carrier liveborn recurrence risk of Down syndrome (trisomy $21$) to the paternal-carrier liveborn recurrence risk.\n\nLet us define the relevant events:\n- $C_M$: Conception occurs with a female carrier of rob($14;21$).\n- $C_F$: Conception occurs with a male carrier of rob($14;21$).\n- $A$: The conceptus is chromosomally normal or has a balanced translocation.\n- $T$: The conceptus has translocation trisomy $21$ (resulting in Down syndrome).\n- $O$: The conceptus has another unbalanced karyotype.\n- $LB$: The conceptus survives to a live birth.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the probabilities of different types of conceptuses (resulting from the specified gamete frequencies) for both maternal and paternal carriers:\nFor a maternal carrier (context $C_M$):\n- $P(A|C_M) = 0.80$\n- $P(T|C_M) = 0.10$\n- $P(O|C_M) = 0.10$\n\nFor a paternal carrier (context $C_F$):\n- $P(A|C_F) = 0.89$\n- $P(T|C_F) = 0.01$\n- $P(O|C_F) = 0.10$\n\nWe are also given the conditional probabilities of survival to live birth, given the karyotype of the conceptus. These probabilities are assumed to be independent of which parent is the carrier.\n- $P(LB|A) = 0.85$\n- $P(LB|T) = 0.70$\n- $P(LB|O) = 0$\n\nThe liveborn recurrence risk is defined as the conditional probability that a liveborn child has Down syndrome.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the maternal-carrier liveborn recurrence risk, $R_M$. This is the probability that a child has translocation trisomy $21$ given that it is a live birth and the mother is the carrier: $R_M = P(T|LB, C_M)$.\nUsing the definition of conditional probability:\n$$R_M = \\frac{P(T \\cap LB | C_M)}{P(LB | C_M)}$$\nThe numerator can be expanded as $P(T \\cap LB | C_M) = P(LB|T, C_M) P(T|C_M)$. Since survival probability depends only on karyotype, $P(LB|T, C_M) = P(LB|T)$.\n$$P(T \\cap LB | C_M) = P(LB|T) P(T|C_M) = (0.70)(0.10) = 0.07$$\nThe denominator, $P(LB | C_M)$, is the total probability of a live birth given a maternal carrier.
