            "problem": "A translational gynecologic oncology program is implementing folate receptor alpha (FR$\\alpha$) immunohistochemistry (IHC; immunohistochemistry) to identify patients with high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma whose tumors are truly FR$\\alpha$-high for potential eligibility to an FR$\\alpha$-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC; antibody-drug conjugate). Define the event $D$ as “tumor is truly FR$\\alpha$-high” and the event $+$ as “FR$\\alpha$ IHC result is positive.” You are given the following empirically validated characteristics for the IHC assay: sensitivity $0.85$ (that is, $P(+\\mid D)=0.85$), specificity $0.80$ (that is, $P(-\\mid \\overline{D})=0.80$), and prevalence of true FR$\\alpha$-high tumors in this population $0.40$ (that is, $P(D)=0.40$).\n\nStarting from Bayes’ theorem and the definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and the law of total probability, derive the expression for the positive predictive value (PPV; positive predictive value), which is $P(D\\mid +)$, in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence, and then compute the PPV for the given values.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in medical statistics, well-posed with all necessary data provided, and objective in its formulation. We will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe task is to derive the expression for the positive predictive value (PPV), defined as $P(D\\mid +)$, and then compute its numerical value. We are given the following information:\n-   The prevalence of the condition: $P(D) = 0.40$\n-   The sensitivity of the test: $P(+\\mid D) = 0.85$\n-   The specificity of the test: $P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.80$\n\nThe derivation begins with Bayes’ theorem, which relates the conditional probability of an event to its inverse. For the events $D$ (true disease state) and $+$ (positive test result), Bayes' theorem is written as:\n$$P(D\\mid +) = \\frac{P(+\\mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}$$\nHere, $P(D\\mid +)$ is the posterior probability of the tumor being FR$\\alpha$-high given a positive IHC result, which is the definition of PPV. $P(+\\mid D)$ is the sensitivity of the test, and $P(D)$ is the prior probability or prevalence of the condition.\n\nThe denominator, $P(+)$, is the total probability of obtaining a positive test result. This can be calculated for the entire population by considering the two mutually exclusive scenarios: a patient truly has an FR$\\alpha$-high tumor ($D$) or does not ($\\overline{D}$). Using the law of total probability, we can expand $P(+)$ as:\n$$P(+) = P(+\\mid D) P(D) + P(+\\mid \\overline{D}) P(\\overline{D})$$\nThis expression states that the probability of a positive test is the sum of the probabilities of a true positive and a false positive.\n\nWe need to express all terms on the right-hand side using the given quantities: sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence.\n-   $P(+\\mid D)$ is the sensitivity.\n-   $P(D)$ is the prevalence.\n-   $P(\\overline{D})$ is the probability of the tumor not being FR$\\alpha$-high. Since $D$ and $\\overline{D}$ are complementary events, $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P(D)$.\n-   $P(+\\mid \\overline{D})$ is the false positive rate. It is the probability of a positive test result given that the tumor is not truly FR$\\alpha$-high. The specificity is given as $P(-\\mid \\overline{D})$, the probability of a negative test result in a truly non-high tumor. For the sub-population $\\overline{D}$, the test can only be positive or negative, so $P(+\\mid \\overline{D}) + P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1$. Therefore, we can express the false positive rate in terms of specificity:\n    $$P(+\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - \\text{specificity}$$\n\nSubstituting these relationships back into the formula for $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = (\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})$$\n\nNow we substitute this expanded expression for $P(+)$ into Bayes' theorem to obtain the final formula for the PPV in terms of the given parameters:\n$$P(D\\mid +) = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) \\times (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) \\times (1 - \\text{prevalence})}$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for the PPV using the provided data:\n-   sensitivity $= 0.85$\n-   specificity $= 0.80$\n-   prevalence $= 0.40$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required probabilities:\n-   $P(D) = 0.40$\n-   $P(\\overline{D}) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$\n-   $P(+\\mid D) = 0.85$\n-   $P(-\\mid \\overline{D}) = 0.80$, which implies $P(+\\mid \\overline{D}) = 1 - 0.80 = 0.20$\n\nNow, we calculate the numerator and denominator of the PPV expression.\nThe numerator is the probability of a true positive result, $P(+\\cap D)$:\n$$P(+\\mid D) \\times P(D) = 0.85 \\times 0.40 = 0.34$$\n\nThe denominator is the total probability of a positive result, $P(+)$:\n$$P(+) = P(+\\mid D)P(D) + P(+\\mid \\overline{D})P(\\overline{D})$$\n$$P(+) = (0.85 \\times 0.40) + (0.20 \\times 0.60)$$\n$$P(+) = 0.34 + 0.12 = 0.46$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the PPV, $P(D\\mid +)$:\n$$P(D\\mid +) = \\frac{0.34}{0.46} = \\frac{34}{46} = \\frac{17}{23}$$\n$$P(D\\mid +) \\approx 0.7391304...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain $0.7391$.",

            "introduction": "Once a patient is selected for therapy, translating a dosing regimen into an administrable dose requires careful calculation that balances clinical efficacy with practical constraints.

Round your answer to four significant figures and express it in scientific notation.",
            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, containing all necessary information and constraints to determine a unique solution. The scenario represents a standard pharmaceutical calculation in clinical oncology.\n\nThe solution process involves a sequential application of the given constraints.\n\nFirst, the ideal weight-based dose is calculated. Let $W$ be the patient's weight and $R$ be the nominal dose regimen.\nThe givens are:\n- Patient weight, $W = 68\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Nominal dose rate, $R = 15\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe calculated dose, $D_{calc}$, is the product of the weight and the dose rate:\n$$D_{calc} = W \\times R = 68\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 15\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}} = 1020\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nSecond, the acceptable range for the administered dose, $D_{admin}$, is determined based on the permitted deviation of $\\pm 5\\%$. Let the deviation fraction be $\\delta = 0.05$. The allowed range is $[D_{lower}, D_{upper}]$, where:\n$$D_{lower} = D_{calc} \\times (1 - \\delta) = 1020\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times (1 - 0.05) = 1020\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times 0.95 = 969\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$D_{upper} = D_{calc} \\times (1 + \\delta) = 1020\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times (1 + 0.05) = 1020\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\times 1.05 = 1071\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThus, the administered dose $D_{admin}$ must satisfy the inequality:\n$$969\\,\\mathrm{mg} \\leq D_{admin} \\leq 1071\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThird, we apply the constraint that the administered dose must be a multiple of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. This is because any dose prepared from the available $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials will necessarily be a multiple of $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. We must find an integer $k$ such that $D_{admin} = k \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ falls within the acceptable range.\nSubstituting this into the inequality:\n$$969 \\leq k \\times 100 \\leq 1071$$\nDividing all parts of the inequality by $100$:\n$$9.69 \\leq k \\leq 10.71$$\nThe only integer value for $k$ that satisfies this condition is $k=10$.\n\nTherefore, the only possible administered dose that meets both the $\\pm 5\\%$ deviation rule and the vial size constraint is:\n$$D_{admin} = 10 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nFourth, we consider the constraint of minimizing wastage. Wastage is defined as the total drug content from opened vials minus the administered dose. To prepare a dose of $1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, the pharmacy can use various combinations of the available $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ and $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials. For instance:\n- Two $400\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials and two $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials: Total content = $2 \\times 400 + 2 \\times 100 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\n- Ten $100\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ vials: Total content = $10 \\times 100 = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.\nIn these cases, the wastage is $1000\\,\\mathrm{mg} - 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 0\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. Since wastage cannot be negative, a wastage of $0$ is the minimum possible. The choice of $D_{admin} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ is therefore consistent with all policy constraints.\n\nThe problem asks for the final administered dose in milligrams, rounded to four significant figures and expressed in scientific notation. The calculated dose is exactly $1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $1.000 \\times 10^3$.\nThe final administered dose is $1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed clinical pharmacology question. It provides sufficient, consistent, and scientifically sound information to determine the correct answer. The critical pieces of information are the drug (olaparib tablets), the indication (maintenance for recurrent ovarian cancer with germline BRCA1 mutation), and the patient's renal function (creatinine clearance of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$). The problem also specifies that the solution should be based on pharmacokinetic principles and FDA label guidance.\n\nThe patient is a $62$-year-old woman with an estimated creatinine clearance ($CrCl$) of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The problem provides a definition for moderate renal impairment as a $CrCl$ in the range of $31$–$50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. Therefore, this patient has moderate renal impairment.\n\nBased on the fundamental pharmacokinetic principles provided:\n1.  Total drug clearance ($CL$) is the sum of clearances by various organs, primarily hepatic ($CL_{\\mathrm{hep}}$) and renal ($CL_{\\mathrm{ren}}$): $CL = CL_{\\mathrm{hep}} + CL_{\\mathrm{ren}}$.\n2.  Olaparib is eliminated via both hepatic metabolism and renal excretion. A decrease in renal function, as indicated by a reduced $CrCl$, leads to a decrease in $CL_{\\mathrm{ren}}$ and consequently a decrease in total clearance $CL$.\n3.  For a drug with linear pharmacokinetics, the steady-state area under the concentration-time curve ($AUC$), a measure of total drug exposure, is given by $AUC = \\dfrac{F \\cdot \\mathrm{Dose}}{CL}$, where $F$ is the bioavailability and $\\mathrm{Dose}$ is the administered dose over a dosing interval.\n4.  If $CL$ decreases and the $\\mathrm{Dose}$ is held constant, the $AUC$ will increase. Increased drug exposure can lead to an increased risk of adverse effects. To maintain a target $AUC$ that is both safe and effective, a dose reduction is necessary to compensate for the reduced clearance.\n\nThe standard dose of olaparib tablets for this indication in patients with normal renal function ($CrCl > 50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$) is $300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ taken orally twice daily. To determine the appropriate adjustment for this patient's moderate renal impairment, we must consult the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information for olaparib (Lynparza®).\n\nThe FDA label explicitly provides dosing recommendations for patients with renal impairment:\n-   No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild renal impairment ($CrCl$ $51$–$80\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$).\n-   For patients with **moderate renal impairment** ($CrCl$ $31$–$50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$), the recommended dose is reduced to **$200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily**.\n-   For patients with severe renal impairment ($CrCl$ $15$–$30\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$), the recommended dose is reduced to $150\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily.\n\nThe patient's $CrCl$ of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$ falls into the moderate renal impairment category. Therefore, the appropriate initial dosing strategy is to reduce the standard dose from $300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily to $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option.\n\n**A. $300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily without adjustment**\nThis is the standard dose for patients with normal renal function. Administering this dose to a patient with moderate renal impairment would lead to increased drug exposure ($AUC$) due to decreased clearance, elevating the risk of toxicity (e.g., myelosuppression, nausea, fatigue). This approach is not consistent with FDA guidelines or sound pharmacokinetic principles. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. $200\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily**\nThis dose is the specific, evidence-based recommendation from the FDA for patients with moderate renal impairment ($CrCl$ $31$–$50\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$). The patient's $CrCl$ of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$ places her in this category. This dose reduction is designed to achieve a drug exposure comparable to that in patients with normal renal function receiving the standard dose. **Correct**.\n\n**C. $300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ once daily**\nThis regimen alters both the total daily dose (a reduction from $600\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ to $300\\,\\mathrm{mg}$) and the dosing frequency. While it reduces the total daily dose, it is not the recommended adjustment. Approved dosing regimens are established to maintain drug concentrations within a therapeutic window. Changing from twice-daily to once-daily dosing would alter the pharmacokinetic profile, leading to a higher peak concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{max}}$) and a lower trough concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{min}}$) than the approved twice-daily regimens, which could compromise efficacy and/or safety. The label-specified adjustment is a reduction of the twice-daily dose magnitude, not a change in frequency. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $150\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ twice daily**\nThis dose is the recommendation for patients with **severe** renal impairment ($CrCl$ $15$–$30\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$). Since the patient has only moderate renal impairment, this dose reduction is excessive and would likely result in sub-therapeutic drug exposure, potentially compromising the anti-cancer efficacy of the treatment. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Avoid olaparib because it is contraindicated when creatinine clearance is below $40\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. Olaparib is not contraindicated for patients with a $CrCl$ of $35\\,\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The FDA label provides specific dose-reduction guidance for this level of renal function, indicating that the drug can be used safely and effectively with appropriate adjustment. A contraindication implies the risk outweighs any potential benefit, which is not the case here. **Incorrect**.",
