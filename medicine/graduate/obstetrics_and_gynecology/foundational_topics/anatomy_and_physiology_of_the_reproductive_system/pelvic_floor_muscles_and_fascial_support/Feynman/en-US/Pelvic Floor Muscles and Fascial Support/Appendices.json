A solution will be provided by analyzing the options based on the foundational principles and the provided data.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to derive and apply clinically sound diagnostic criteria for levator avulsion based on the provided principles.\n\n**1. Interpretation of Principles:**\n*   **Principle (i)** implies that a true avulsion is a structural discontinuity. This should manifest as a very small, near-zero attachment length ($MAL$).\n*   **Principle (ii)** is a critical rule for avoiding imaging artifacts. A diagnosis of avulsion should not be made from a single slice; the defect must be seen across multiple adjacent slices (e.g., $\\ge 3$ slices).\n*   **Principle (iii)** suggests that the defect should be substantial not just in linear terms but also in its angular extent ($DA$).\n\n**2. Synthesis of Criteria:**\nBased on the principles, a robust definition for **avulsion** would combine all three elements:\n1.  A very small Minimum Attachment Length ($MAL$), suggesting discontinuity.\n2.  The finding must be present across multiple adjacent slices.\n3.  A large Defect Angle ($DA$), indicating a significant portion of the muscle origin is missing.\n\nA definition for **muscular thinning** (or a normal state) would involve:\n1.  A substantial $MAL$, indicating preserved continuity.\n2.  A small $DA$.\n\n**3. Application to Patient Data:**\n*   **Right Side**: $MAL = 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (very small) and $DA = 80^\\circ$ (large) in 3 central slices. This strongly fits the synthesized criteria for **avulsion**.\n*   **Left Side**: $MAL = 14\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (substantial) and $DA = 20^\\circ$ (small) across all slices, with \"continuous muscle-to-bone contact.\" This fits the criteria for a normal or **thinned** (but not avulsed) muscle.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. Define avulsion as $MAL \\le 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in $\\ge 3$ central slices together with $DA \\ge 60^\\circ$ in the same region; define muscular thinning as preserved continuity with $MAL \\ge 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $DA  30^\\circ$. By these criteria, the right side shows avulsion and the left side shows thinning.**\n    *   **Criteria Analysis**: These criteria are excellent. They incorporate a low $MAL$ threshold, a high $DA$ threshold, and the multi-slice requirement for avulsion, perfectly aligning with the given principles. The definition for thinning is also logical.\n    *   **Application**: The right side meets the avulsion criteria ($MAL = 2 \\le 5$, $DA = 80 \\ge 60$, across 3 slices). The left side meets the thinning criteria ($MAL = 14 \\ge 10$, $DA = 20  30$). The classification is correct.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is correct.\n\n*   **B. Define avulsion as present if either $MAL  10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ in any one slice or $DA \\ge 20^\\circ$ in any one slice; define muscular thinning otherwise. By these criteria, both sides show avulsion.**\n    *   **Criteria Analysis**: These criteria are flawed. Diagnosing on \"any one slice\" violates Principle (ii). Using \"or\" with a low threshold for $DA$ ($20^\\circ$) is too sensitive and would misclassify the healthy left side as avulsed.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because its criteria are invalid.\n\n*   **C. Define avulsion only when $MAL = 0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ across all $8$ slices; define muscular thinning otherwise. By these criteria, both sides show thinning.**\n    *   **Criteria Analysis**: This criterion is far too strict and clinically unrealistic. It would miss almost all true avulsions, which are often partial and focal.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because its criteria are invalid.\n\n*   **D. Define avulsion solely by a levator–urethra gap $> 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ irrespective of $MAL$ or $DA$; define muscular thinning if the gap is $\\le 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Apply this criterion to classify the case.**\n    *   **Criteria Analysis**: This option is invalid as it introduces an external metric (\"levator-urethra gap\") not provided in the problem data. The task was to use $MAL$ and $DA$.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect because it does not answer the question asked.\n\nTherefore, Option A provides the most clinically and scientifically sound criteria and applies them correctly to the patient's data.",

For each weekly session $i$, a resting baseline is recorded immediately before each task to account for noise and tonic activity, and a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) is obtained for the same muscle and electrode configuration.

Finally, the net fractional improvement is calculated based on the indices from the two weeks.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{LA},i}$ and $E_{\\text{EUS},i}$ be the normalized EMG values for the levator ani and external urethral sphincter, respectively, at week $i$. Let $I_i$ be the composite support index for week $i$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the normalized EMG values for Week $1$.\nFor the levator ani (LA) at Week $1$, the normalized value is:\n$$E_{\\text{LA},1} = \\frac{A_1 - B_1}{M_1} = \\frac{38 - 6}{120} = \\frac{32}{120} = \\frac{4}{15}$$\nFor the external urethral sphincter (EUS) at Week $1$, the normalized value is:\n$$E_{\\text{EUS},1} = \\frac{P_1 - b_1}{N_1} = \\frac{52 - 8}{160} = \\frac{44}{160} = \\frac{11}{40}$$\n\nNext, we compute the composite support index for Week $1$, $I_1$, using the given weights $w_{\\text{LA}} = 0.7$ and $w_{\\text{EUS}} = 0.3$.\n$$I_1 = w_{\\text{LA}} E_{\\text{LA},1} + w_{\\text{EUS}} E_{\\text{EUS},1} = (0.7) \\left( \\frac{4}{15} \\right) + (0.3) \\left( \\frac{11}{40} \\right)$$\n$$I_1 = \\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{4}{15} + \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot \\frac{11}{40} = \\frac{28}{150} + \\frac{33}{400}$$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $1200$.\n$$I_1 = \\frac{28 \\times 8}{150 \\times 8} + \\frac{33 \\times 3}{400 \\times 3} = \\frac{224}{1200} + \\frac{99}{1200} = \\frac{323}{1200}$$\n\nNow, we repeat the calculations for Week $8$.\nFor the levator ani (LA) at Week $8$:\n$$E_{\\text{LA},8} = \\frac{A_8 - B_8}{M_8} = \\frac{70 - 5}{140} = \\frac{65}{140} = \\frac{13}{28}$$\nFor the external urethral sphincter (EUS) at Week $8$:\n$$E_{\\text{EUS},8} = \\frac{P_8 - b_8}{N_8} = \\frac{88 - 7}{170} = \\frac{81}{170}$$\n\nWe compute the composite support index for Week $8$, $I_8$:\n$$I_8 = w_{\\text{LA}} E_{\\text{LA},8} + w_{\\text{EUS}} E_{\\text{EUS},8} = (0.7) \\left( \\frac{13}{28} \\right) + (0.3) \\left( \\frac{81}{170} \\right)$$\n$$I_8 = \\frac{7}{10} \\cdot \\frac{13}{28} + \\frac{3}{10} \\cdot \\frac{81}{170} = \\frac{13}{40} + \\frac{243}{1700}$$\nThe common denominator for $40$ and $1700$ is $3400$.\n$$I_8 = \\frac{13 \\times 85}{40 \\times 85} + \\frac{243 \\times 2}{1700 \\times 2} = \\frac{1105}{3400} + \\frac{486}{3400} = \\frac{1591}{3400}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the net fractional improvement, $\\Delta I_{\\text{net}}$, from Week $1$ to Week $8$. This is defined as the change in the index divided by the initial index value.\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{I_8 - I_1}{I_1} = \\frac{I_8}{I_1} - 1$$\nSubstituting the fractional values for $I_1$ and $I_8$:\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{1591/3400}{323/1200} - 1 = \\left( \\frac{1591}{3400} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1200}{323} \\right) - 1$$\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{1591 \\times 1200}{3400 \\times 323} - 1 = \\frac{1591 \\times 12}{34 \\times 323} - 1 = \\frac{1591 \\times 6}{17 \\times 323} - 1$$\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{9546}{5491} - 1 = \\frac{9546 - 5491}{5491} = \\frac{4055}{5491}$$\nTo provide the answer as a decimal, we perform the division:\n$$\\Delta I_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{4055}{5491} \\approx 0.73847933...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.7385$.",
