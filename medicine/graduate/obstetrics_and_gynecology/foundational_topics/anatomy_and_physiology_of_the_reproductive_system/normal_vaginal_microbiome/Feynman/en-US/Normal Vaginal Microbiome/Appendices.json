A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe specific growth rate, $\\mu$, of Lactobacillus is described by the Monod equation, which relates the growth rate to the concentration of a limiting substrate, $S$:\n$$\n\\mu(S) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S}{K_{s} + S}\n$$\nHere, $\\mu_{\\max}$ is the maximum specific growth rate and $K_{s}$ is the half-saturation constant, which is the substrate concentration at which the growth rate is half of the maximum ($\\mu = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{\\max}$).\n\nFirst, we calculate the baseline specific growth rate, $\\mu_{0}$, using the initial substrate concentration, $S_{0} = 50$ mg/L. The given parameters are $\\mu_{\\max} = 0.60$ h$^{-1}$ and $K_{s} = 25$ mg/L.\n$$\n\\mu_{0} = \\mu(S_{0}) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S_{0}}{K_{s} + S_{0}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mu_{0} = \\frac{(0.60 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}) (50 \\, \\text{mg/L})}{(25 \\, \\text{mg/L}) + (50 \\, \\text{mg/L})} = \\frac{30}{75} \\, \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.40 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nNext, we determine the new substrate concentration, $S_{1}$, after the administration of the prebiotic. The prebiotic adds to the available substrate pool. The increase in substrate concentration is the product of the prebiotic concentration, $C_{p}$, and its accessibility fraction, $f$.\n$$\nS_{1} = S_{0} + f C_{p}\n$$\nUsing the given values $S_{0} = 50$ mg/L, $f = 0.50$, and $C_{p} = 100$ mg/L:\n$$\nS_{1} = 50 \\, \\text{mg/L} + (0.50)(100 \\, \\text{mg/L}) = 50 \\, \\text{mg/L} + 50 \\, \\text{mg/L} = 100 \\, \\text{mg/L}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the new specific growth rate, $\\mu_{1}$, at this supplemented substrate concentration, $S_{1}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{1} = \\mu(S_{1}) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S_{1}}{K_{s} + S_{1}}\n$$\nSubstituting the values for $\\mu_{\\max}$, $K_{s}$, and the newly calculated $S_{1}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{1} = \\frac{(0.60 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}) (100 \\, \\text{mg/L})}{(25 \\, \\text{mg/L}) + (100 \\, \\text{mg/L})} = \\frac{60}{125} \\, \\text{h}^{-1} = 0.48 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the unitless fold-change in the specific growth rate, which is the ratio $\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}}$. We can compute this ratio symbolically first:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S_{1}}{K_{s} + S_{1}}}{\\frac{\\mu_{\\max} S_{0}}{K_{s} + S_{0}}}\n$$\nThe $\\mu_{\\max}$ terms cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{K_{s} + S_{0}}{K_{s} + S_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values into this expression:\n$S_{0} = 50$ mg/L, $S_{1} = 100$ mg/L, and $K_{s} = 25$ mg/L.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{100}{50}\\right) \\left(\\frac{25 + 50}{25 + 100}\\right) = (2) \\left(\\frac{75}{125}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{75}{125} = \\frac{3 \\times 25}{5 \\times 25} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6\n$$\nTherefore, the fold-change is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}} = 2 \\times 0.6 = 1.2\n$$\nAlternatively, using the calculated rates:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{1}}{\\mu_{0}} = \\frac{0.48 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}}{0.40 \\, \\text{h}^{-1}} = 1.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$1.2$ expressed to four significant figures is $1.200$.",

All necessary parameters and definitions are provided to derive a unique solution. The model, while a simplification of complex biological reality, is based on standard and sound principles of mass conservation, stoichiometry, and steady-state kinetics used in physiological modeling.\n\nThe solution will be derived in three sequential parts, as requested by the problem.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Lactic Acid Yield from Glycogen**\n\nThe overall conversion of glycogen to lactic acid by *Lactobacillus crispatus* is a two-step process in this model: glycogen is first hydrolyzed to glucose, and glucose is then fermented to lactic acid. The overall mass yield of lactic acid from glycogen, denoted $Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}}$, can be calculated by multiplying the yield coefficients of the individual steps.\n\nThe yield of glucose from glycogen is given as $Y_{\\mathrm{Glc/Gly}} = 0.90\\,\\mathrm{g\\,glucose}/\\mathrm{g\\,glycogen}$.\nThe yield of lactic acid from glucose is given as $Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Glc}} = 0.92\\,\\mathrm{g\\,lactic\\ acid}/\\mathrm{g\\,glucose}$.\n\nThe combined yield is the product of these two coefficients:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}} = Y_{\\mathrm{Glc/Gly}} \\times Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Glc}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}} = (0.90) \\times (0.92) = 0.828\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{g\\,lactic\\,acid}{g\\,glycogen}}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Steady-State Lactate Concentration**\n\nAt steady state, the rate of production of a substance must equal its rate of removal. We first calculate the mass production rate of lactic acid, $R_{\\mathrm{LA}}$, by multiplying the glycogen supply rate, $R_{\\mathrm{gly}}$, by the overall yield coefficient, $Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}}$.\n\n$$R_{\\mathrm{LA}} = R_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\times Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}}$$\nThe removal of lactate from the cervicovaginal fluid (CVF) is described as a first-order clearance process with a rate constant $k$. The rate of removal is therefore proportional to the total mass of lactate, $m_{\\mathrm{LA}}$, present in the CVF at any given time:\n$$\\text{Rate of Removal} = k \\times m_{\\mathrm{LA}}$$\nAt steady state, let the mass of lactate be $m_{\\mathrm{LA}, ss}$. The mass balance equation is:\n$$\\text{Rate of Production} = \\text{Rate of Removal}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{LA}} = k \\times m_{\\mathrm{LA}, ss}$$\nWe can solve for the steady-state mass of lactate:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{LA}, ss} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{LA}}}{k} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\times Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}}}{k}$$\nThe problem asks for the total steady-state lactate concentration, which we will calculate as a molar concentration, $[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}$. This is found by dividing the steady-state mass $m_{\\mathrm{LA}, ss}$ by the CVF volume $V$ and the molar mass of lactic acid $M_{\\mathrm{LA}}$.\n\n$$[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{LA}, ss}}{V \\times M_{\\mathrm{LA}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{gly}} \\times Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}}}{k \\times V \\times M_{\\mathrm{LA}}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{LA/Gly}} = 0.828$$\n$$[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss} = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,hr^{-1}}) \\times 0.828}{(0.25\\,\\mathrm{hr^{-1}}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{L}) \\times (90.08\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}})}$$\n$$[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss} = \\frac{4.968 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,hr^{-1}}}{0.04504\\,\\mathrm{g\\,hr^{-1}\\,mol^{-1}\\,L}} \\approx 0.11030\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Steady-State pH**\n\nThe buffer capacity, $\\beta$, relates the concentration of added acid to the resulting change in $\\mathrm{pH}$. The problem defines $\\beta = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}n_{\\mathrm{acid}}/V}{\\mathrm{d}(\\mathrm{pH})}$. For a constant $\\beta$ over the relevant $\\mathrm{pH}$ range, we can use the macroscopic form:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{acid}}}{|\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})|}$$\nwhere $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{acid}}$ is the concentration of added acid equivalents, which in this case is the total steady-state lactate concentration $[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}$. The change in $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})$, is the difference between the final steady-state $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\mathrm{pH}_{ss}$, and the initial baseline $\\mathrm{pH}$, $\\mathrm{pH}_{0}$. Since the addition of acid causes the $\\mathrm{pH}$ to decrease, $|\\Delta(\\mathrm{pH})| = \\mathrm{pH}_{0} - \\mathrm{pH}_{ss}$.\n\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$\\beta = \\frac{[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}}{\\mathrm{pH}_{0} - \\mathrm{pH}_{ss}}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the final steady-state $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{0} - \\mathrm{pH}_{ss} = \\frac{[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}}{\\beta}$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{ss} = \\mathrm{pH}_{0} - \\frac{[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}}{\\beta}$$\nSubstituting the known values for $\\mathrm{pH}_{0}$, $\\beta$, and the calculated value for $[LA]_{\\mathrm{total}, ss}$:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{ss} = 7.0 - \\frac{0.11030\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}}}{0.040\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}\\,pH^{-1}}}$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{ss} = 7.0 - 2.7575$$\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{ss} = 4.2425$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

This result is consistent with the initial assumption that $\\mathrm{pH} < pK_a$ ($3.530 < 3.86$).",
