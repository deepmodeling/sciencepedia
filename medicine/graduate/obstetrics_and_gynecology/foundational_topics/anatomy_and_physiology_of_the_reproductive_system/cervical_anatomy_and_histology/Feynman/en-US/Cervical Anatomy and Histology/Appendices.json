            "problem": "A clinician is preparing to teach a colposcopy course to advanced trainees and wants them to reason from cervical anatomical and histological first principles rather than recall isolated appearances. Consider the following scenario and choose the single most accurate predicted gross appearance.\n\nBaseline facts:\n- The ectocervix is covered by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium, while the endocervical canal is lined by mucin-secreting simple columnar epithelium; their junction is the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ).\n- The location of the SCJ and the extent of apparent ectropion (eversion of endocervical columnar epithelium onto the ectocervix) are influenced by hormonal milieu (notably estrogen) and mechanical factors.\n- Vaginal childbirth produces circumferential dilation and may cause lateral cervical lacerations and irregular scarring, altering the external os shape from the nulliparous round or pinpoint appearance to transverse slit-like or stellate forms.\n\nA patient aged 32 years, Para 3 (P3), has a documented history of bilateral lateral cervical lacerations after 2 prior vaginal deliveries and currently uses a combined oral contraceptive containing estrogen. She presents for routine examination without symptoms. The clinician anticipates that estrogen exposure will favor persistence of eversion and that prior lacerations will have mechanically altered the external os.\n\nWhich option best describes the expected gross appearance of the ectocervix, including the external os shape, the presence or absence of apparent ectropion, and the likely position of the squamocolumnar junction?\n\nA. A round, pinpoint external os with no surrounding erythematous area; the squamocolumnar junction lies well within the endocervical canal.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated by first extracting the given information and then assessing its scientific and logical integrity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Epithelial Lining:** The ectocervix is covered by non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The endocervical canal is lined by mucin-secreting simple columnar epithelium. The junction between them is the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ).\n- **Hormonal and Mechanical Influences:** The SCJ location and the extent of ectropion (eversion of columnar epithelium) are influenced by hormones (estrogen) and mechanical factors.\n- **Effects of Childbirth:** Vaginal childbirth causes dilation and may lead to lateral cervical lacerations and scarring, altering the external os from a nulliparous round/pinpoint shape to a transverse slit-like or stellate form.\n- **Patient Profile:**\n    - Age: 32 years.\n    - Parity: Para 3 (P3), indicating three pregnancies carried to a viable gestational age.\n    - Delivery History: History of bilateral lateral cervical lacerations after 2 prior vaginal deliveries.\n    - Medication: Currently uses a combined oral contraceptive containing estrogen.\n    - Presentation: Routine examination, asymptomatic.\n- **Clinician's Anticipation (Problem Premises):**\n    - Estrogen exposure will favor the persistence of eversion (ectropion).\n    - Prior lacerations will have mechanically altered the external os.\n- **Question:** Predict the most accurate gross appearance of the ectocervix, including external os shape, presence of ectropion, and SCJ position.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated for its scientific grounding, consistency, and structure.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The premises are fundamental facts of cervical anatomy, histology, and physiology as taught in obstetrics and gynecology. The description of the epithelia, the concept of the SCJ, the hormonal influence of estrogen on ectropion, and the mechanical effects of childbirth on the external os are all well-established, core principles. The patient scenario is clinically realistic. Verdict: **Valid**.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a specific set of conditions (parity, laceration history, hormonal status) and asks for the most likely resulting anatomical appearance. This structure allows for a single, most probable conclusion to be derived through logical application of the provided principles. Verdict: **Valid**.\n- **Objective:** The language is clinical and precise. It avoids ambiguity and subjective claims. The problem requires reasoning from established cause-and-effect relationships (e.g., childbirth → altered os; estrogen → ectropion). Verdict: **Valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, logically consistent, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Expected Appearance\nWe must synthesize the expected cervical appearance by integrating the effects of the patient's multiparity, history of traumatic delivery, and current hormonal status.\n\n1.  **Effect on External Os Shape:** The patient is Para 3 (P3) with a history of 2 vaginal deliveries. The problem states that vaginal childbirth alters the nulliparous (round/pinpoint) os to a \"transverse slit-like or stellate\" form. Furthermore, the patient has a documented history of \"bilateral lateral cervical lacerations.\" Such lacerations, upon healing, would create scarring and further accentuate the transverse dimension of the os, leading to an irregular, slit-like, and potentially star-shaped (stellate) appearance. Therefore, we predict a parous os, specifically one that is transverse and irregular due to scarring.\n\n2.  **Effect on Epithelium (Ectropion):** The patient is taking a combined oral contraceptive, which contains estrogen. The problem explicitly states that estrogen \"favor[s] persistence of eversion\" (ectropion). Ectropion is the presence of the single-layered, glandular, endocervical columnar epithelium on the outer, visible portion of the cervix (the ectocervix). This tissue is more vascular and delicate than the surrounding stratified squamous epithelium, and thus appears as an erythematous (red) zone around the external os. Therefore, the presence of a visible ectropion is the expected finding.\n\n3.  **Effect on Squamocolumnar Junction (SCJ) Position:** The SCJ is the border between the squamous and columnar epithelia. If ectropion is present—meaning the columnar epithelium is everted onto the ectocervix—then the SCJ must, by definition, be located on the ectocervical surface. It forms the outer boundary of the erythematous zone of the ectropion.\n\n**Conclusion:** The predicted appearance is a cervix with a transverse, irregular, slit-like or stellate os, surrounded by a red area of ectropion, with the SCJ located on the ectocervical surface.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. A round, pinpoint external os with no surrounding erythematous area; the squamocolumnar junction lies well within the endocervical canal.**\n- **Analysis:** A \"round, pinpoint\" os is characteristic of a nulliparous woman, which contradicts the patient's P3 status and history of 2 vaginal deliveries. \"No surrounding erythematous area\" (i.e., no ectropion) contradicts the expected hormonal effect of the estrogen-containing contraceptive.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. A transverse, slit-like external os with irregular stellate margins consistent with healed lateral lacerations; a circumferential erythematous zone consistent with apparent ectropion; the squamocolumnar junction is located on the ectocervical surface.**\n- **Analysis:** This description aligns perfectly with our derivation. The \"transverse, slit-like external os with irregular stellate margins\" correctly reflects the patient's parity and history of lacerations. The \"circumferential erythematous zone consistent with apparent ectropion\" correctly reflects the expected effect of estrogen. The statement that the \"squamocolumnar junction is located on the ectocervical surface\" is the correct anatomical consequence of ectropion.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**C. A gaping external os that is narrowed by fibrotic scarring; a uniformly pale squamous epithelium extending into the canal; the squamocolumnar junction is retracted within the endocervical canal with absent ectropion.**\n- **Analysis:** The description of a \"uniformly pale squamous epithelium\" and \"absent ectropion\" with a retracted SCJ is characteristic of a low-estrogen state, such as in a postmenopausal woman. This directly contradicts the patient's use of an estrogen-containing contraceptive.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. A circular external os with a focal anterior red area labeled as ectropion, but the squamocolumnar junction remains entirely within the endocervical canal.**\n- **Analysis:** A \"circular\" os is inconsistent with the patient's multiparity and history of lacerations. More critically, the statement contains a logical contradiction: if there is an area of ectropion on the ectocervix, the SCJ (the border of that area) must also be on the ectocervix. It is anatomically impossible for the SCJ to \"remain entirely within the endocervical canal\" while ectropion is simultaneously present on the ectocervix.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. A slit-like external os, but the previously everted columnar epithelium has undergone complete squamous metaplasia producing a thin, pale rim; the squamocolumnar junction lies at or just internal to the external os, with minimal visible erythema.**\n- **Analysis:** This option describes an advanced stage of the healing process known as squamous metaplasia, where the everted columnar epithelium is replaced by squamous epithelium. While this process occurs, a high-estrogen environment (from the oral contraceptive) promotes columnar cell proliferation and eversion, thereby inhibiting or reversing the maturation of metaplasia. The described appearance (\"pale rim\", \"minimal visible erythema\") is the opposite of what is expected under the patient's current hormonal influence.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "A colposcopy-guided biopsy is obtained from a cervical lesion in a 36-year-old patient. Hematoxylin and eosin staining reveals a multilayered non-keratinizing stratified epithelium with a basal layer of small cells, intermediate glycogenated cells, and superficial nucleated squamous cells, without apical mucin. The lamina propria shows a mild chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrates the following in the epithelial compartment: Cytokeratin 13 (CK13) is diffusely positive in suprabasal and intermediate cells, cytokeratin 7 (CK7) is negative, and p63 (tumor protein 63) shows nuclear staining limited to the basal layer.

The described markers (p63, CK7, CK13) and their expression patterns are standard in the field and scientifically accurate.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a comprehensive and internally consistent set of findings (histological, special stain, and immunohistochemical) and asks for the single best classification based on this evidence. A unique and logical conclusion can be derived.\n3.  **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and descriptive, presenting objective laboratory findings without subjectivity or bias.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency:** The data is complete and consistent. The H&E morphology of a stratified, non-keratinized, glycogenated epithelium is congruent with the special stain results (mucin-negative) and IHC profile (CK13+/CK7-/basal p63+). The positive internal control for CK7 confirms the validity of the negative result in the epithelium of interest. There are no contradictions.\n5.  **Realism:** The described findings are entirely realistic and represent a classic presentation of a specific type of cervical tissue.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis requires integrating the morphological, histochemical, and immunohistochemical data to determine the origin and differentiation state of the epithelium.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Morphology (H&E):** The description is of a \"multilayered non-keratinizing stratified epithelium\" with distinct basal, intermediate, and superficial layers. The presence of \"intermediate glycogenated cells\" and \"superficial nucleated squamous cells\" is the classic morphological definition of mature native squamous epithelium of the ectocervix. The lack of \"apical mucin\" argues against a glandular or mucinous phenotype.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Special Stains:**\n    - The \"mucicarmine\" stain is negative. Mucicarmine specifically stains acidic mucopolysaccharides, such as the mucin produced by endocervical glandular cells. This negative result provides strong evidence against an endocervical glandular origin.\n    - The \"Periodic acid–Schiff with diastase (PAS-D)\" stain is negative. The PAS reaction stains glycogen, among other carbohydrates. Diastase is an enzyme that digests glycogen. A positive PAS stain that becomes negative after diastase treatment (PAS-D negative) indicates the presence of glycogen. This result is consistent with the H&E finding of \"intermediate glycogenated cells\" and is a hallmark of mature, estrogenized squamous epithelium.\n\n3.  **Analysis of Immunohistochemistry (IHC):**\n    - **p63:** Nuclear staining is \"limited to the basal layer.\" p63 is a transcription factor crucial for maintaining the proliferative potential of basal/stem cells in stratified epithelia. This restricted basal pattern is the normal, physiological expression in mature squamous epithelium, reflecting organized maturation from the proliferative basal layer to the differentiated superficial layers.\n    - **CK7:** The epithelium is \"negative\" for CK7. CK7 is a low-molecular-weight cytokeratin characteristic of simple glandular epithelia, including those of Müllerian origin like the endocervix, endometrium, and fallopian tube. The negativity for CK7 effectively rules out an origin from endocervical or endometrial glandular epithelium. The fact that the internal control (endocervical glands) is positive confirms the technical validity of the stain.\n    - **CK13:** The epithelium is \"diffusely positive in suprabasal and intermediate cells.\" CK13 is a high-molecular-weight cytokeratin whose expression is characteristic of terminal differentiation in non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelia. Its presence indicates a mature squamous differentiation program, moving beyond the progenitor stage.\n\n4.  **Synthesis and Conclusion:**\n    - The morphology is that of mature stratified squamous epithelium.\n    - The histochemistry confirms glycogenation and absence of mucin, supporting a mature squamous and non-glandular phenotype.\n    - The IHC profile (p63 basal, CK7 negative, CK13 positive) is the definitive immunophenotype of mature, differentiated, non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium as found on the native ectocervix.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Mature ectocervical stratified squamous epithelium**\nThis option is perfectly consistent with all the provided data. The H&E morphology (stratified, glycogenated, non-keratinized), special stains (mucin-negative, glycogen-positive), and immunophenotype (CK13+, CK7-, basal p63 expression) are the defining features of this tissue type.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Endocervical mucinous simple columnar epithelium**\nThis is incorrect. The described epithelium is stratified squamous, not simple columnar. It is negative for mucin by H&E and mucicarmine stain. Furthermore, it is CK7 negative, whereas endocervical epithelium is characteristically CK7 positive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Immature squamous metaplasia of the transformation zone**\nThis is incorrect. While squamous metaplasia is a differential, the features described are those of maturity, not immaturity. Immature metaplasia is typically not well-stratified, lacks significant glycogen, and would not express the mature differentiation marker CK13 so diffusely. Immature metaplastic cells often retain CK7 expression from their endocervical cell precursors, which contradicts the CK7 negative finding here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Endometrial glandular epithelium from the lower uterine segment contaminant**\nThis is incorrect. Endometrial epithelium is simple glandular, not stratified squamous. Like endocervical epithelium, it is also of Müllerian origin and would be CK7 positive. The findings directly contradict this possibility.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Cervical reserve cell–columnar complex of endocervical origin**\nThis is incorrect. This complex consists of endocervical columnar cells overlying a layer of progenitor reserve cells. The reserve cells themselves are CK7 positive and p63 positive. An epithelium derived from them (i.e., squamous metaplasia) would initially show features of immaturity and likely CK7 positivity, as discussed in option C. The described epithelium is mature and CK7 negative.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "A key functional role of the endocervical canal in obstetrics and gynecology is governed by its luminal surface morphology. The native mucosa, lined by simple columnar epithelium, forms longitudinal mucosal folds (plicae palmatae) that increase the effective surface area available for mucus production and interaction with the cervical stroma. Consider an idealized model of the endocervical canal as a smooth cylinder of length $L = 35\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ and mean radius $r_{0} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$, after which you will incorporate mucosal folding.\n\n1) Starting from a parametric description of a smooth cylindrical surface in terms of the axial coordinate $z$ and the circumferential angle $\\theta$ (in radians), use elementary surface geometry to derive the luminal surface area of the smooth canal. Do not assume any pre-existing surface-area formula; instead, construct the result from the line element and surface metric.\n\n2) Now model the mucosal folds as small-amplitude, circumferential corrugations that are uniform along $z$, with the radial position of the mucosal surface given by\n$$\nr(\\theta) = r_{0} + a \\sin(n \\theta),\n$$\nwhere $a \\ll r_{0}$ is the fold amplitude and $n$ is the number of circumferential undulations.

It provides a clear, self-contained set of instructions for a mathematical modeling exercise rooted in plausible biological anatomy. All necessary parameters and functional forms are defined, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Surface Area of the Smooth Cylindrical Canal**\n\nWe begin by modeling the smooth endocervical canal as a right circular cylinder. We can describe its surface using a parametric vector function $\\vec{R}(\\theta, z)$ in a Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$. The parameters are the circumferential angle $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ and the axial coordinate $z \\in [0, L]$. With a constant radius $r_{0}$, the parameterization is:\n$$\n\\vec{R}(\\theta, z) = (r_{0}\\cos\\theta, r_{0}\\sin\\theta, z)\n$$\nTo find the surface area, we must first determine the differential surface element, $dS$. This is given by the magnitude of the cross product of the tangent vectors with respect to the parameters $\\theta$ and $z$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivatives of $\\vec{R}$ with respect to $\\theta$ and $z$:\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{\\theta} = \\frac{\\partial\\vec{R}}{\\partial \\theta} = (-r_{0}\\sin\\theta, r_{0}\\cos\\theta, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{z} = \\frac{\\partial\\vec{R}}{\\partial z} = (0, 0, 1)\n$$\nNext, we compute the cross product of these two tangent vectors:\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{\\theta} \\times \\vec{R}_{z} = \\begin{vmatrix} \\mathbf{\\hat{i}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{j}} & \\mathbf{\\hat{k}} \\\\ -r_{0}\\sin\\theta & r_{0}\\cos\\theta & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix} = (r_{0}\\cos\\theta)\\mathbf{\\hat{i}} - (-r_{0}\\sin\\theta)\\mathbf{\\hat{j}} + (0)\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = (r_{0}\\cos\\theta, r_{0}\\sin\\theta, 0)\n$$\nThe magnitude of this vector gives the area of the infinitesimal parallelogram spanned by the tangent vectors:\n$$\ndS = ||\\vec{R}_{\\theta} \\times \\vec{R}_{z}|| d\\theta dz = \\sqrt{(r_{0}\\cos\\theta)^2 + (r_{0}\\sin\\theta)^2 + 0^2} \\, d\\theta dz\n$$\n$$\ndS = \\sqrt{r_{0}^2(\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta)} \\, d\\theta dz = \\sqrt{r_{0}^2} \\, d\\theta dz = r_{0} \\, d\\theta dz\n$$\nThe total surface area of the smooth cylinder, which we denote as $A_{0}$, is found by integrating this surface element over the entire domain of the parameters:\n$$\nA_{0} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} r_{0} \\, d\\theta dz = r_{0} \\int_{0}^{L} [ \\theta ]_{0}^{2\\pi} dz = r_{0} \\int_{0}^{L} 2\\pi \\, dz = 2\\pi r_{0} [z]_{0}^{L}\n$$\n$$\nA_{0} = 2\\pi r_{0} L\n$$\nThis expression is the well-known formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder, derived here from first principles of differential geometry as required.\n\n**Part 2: Approximated Surface Area of the Corrugated Canal**\n\nNow, we introduce the mucosal folds by modeling the surface with a variable radius $r(\\theta) = r_{0} + a \\sin(n \\theta)$. The parameterization becomes:\n$$\n\\vec{R}(\\theta, z) = (r(\\theta)\\cos\\theta, r(\\theta)\\sin\\theta, z)\n$$\nWe follow the same procedure as in Part 1. First, we compute the tangent vectors. The derivative with respect to $z$ remains $\\vec{R}_{z} = (0, 0, 1)$. The derivative with respect to $\\theta$ is more complex. Let $r'(\\theta) = \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = an\\cos(n\\theta)$. Using the product rule:\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{\\theta} = (r'(\\theta)\\cos\\theta - r(\\theta)\\sin\\theta, r'(\\theta)\\sin\\theta + r(\\theta)\\cos\\theta, 0)\n$$\nThe cross product $\\vec{R}_{\\theta} \\times \\vec{R}_{z}$ is:\n$$\n\\vec{R}_{\\theta} \\times \\vec{R}_{z} = (r'(\\theta)\\sin\\theta + r(\\theta)\\cos\\theta, -(r'(\\theta)\\cos\\theta - r(\\theta)\\sin\\theta), 0)\n$$\nThe magnitude of this vector, which defines the surface element $dS$, is:\n$$\n||\\vec{R}_{\\theta} \\times \\vec{R}_{z}|| = \\sqrt{(r'(\\theta)\\sin\\theta + r(\\theta)\\cos\\theta)^2 + (r'(\\theta)\\cos\\theta - r(\\theta)\\sin\\theta)^2}\n$$\nExpanding the squares:\n$$\n= \\sqrt{(r'^{2}\\sin^2\\theta + 2rr'\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + r^2\\cos^2\\theta) + (r'^{2}\\cos^2\\theta - 2rr'\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta + r^2\\sin^2\\theta)}\n$$\n$$\n= \\sqrt{r'^{2}(\\sin^2\\theta + \\cos^2\\theta) + r^2(\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta)} = \\sqrt{r(\\theta)^2 + [r'(\\theta)]^2}\n$$\nThe effective surface area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the integral of this quantity over the surface:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\int_{0}^{L} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{r(\\theta)^2 + [r'(\\theta)]^2} \\, d\\theta dz = L \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sqrt{(r_{0} + a\\sin(n\\theta))^2 + (an\\cos(n\\theta))^2} \\, d\\theta\n$$\nTo proceed, we expand the expression inside the square root and use the condition that $a \\ll r_{0}$.

Real biological structures exhibit more randomness and fractal-like complexity, but this model captures the essential feature of area amplification through folding.\n\nFrom a histological standpoint, this increase in surface area is of paramount functional importance. The endocervical lining is a simple columnar epithelium specialized for mucus secretion. By folding the mucosal layer, the cervix can accommodate a much larger population of these mucus-producing cells within the confined luminal space. This is a common biological design principle, analogous to the villi and microvilli of the small intestine which serve to maximize surface area for nutrient absorption. The greater surface area in the endocervix allows for the production of the copious amounts of mucus necessary to form the cervical plug, which acts as a barrier protecting the upper reproductive tract from infection and plays a dynamic role in sperm transport and fertility. The mathematical result confirms this intuition: the term $\\frac{n^2 a^2}{4r_{0}^2}$ is always positive, demonstrating that any such folding ($a > 0, n \\ge 1$) necessarily increases the surface area relative to a smooth cylinder of the same mean radius and length.\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now use the derived formula to compute the numerical value of $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the given physiological parameters:\n$L = 35\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$r_{0} = 2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$a = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n$n = 10$\n\nFirst, let's calculate the baseline area of the smooth cylinder, $A_{0}$:\n$$\nA_{0} = 2\\pi r_{0} L = 2\\pi (2.5\\ \\mathrm{mm})(35\\ \\mathrm{mm}) = 175\\pi\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\n$$\nNext, we compute the correction factor from the folding:\n$$\n\\text{Correction Factor} = 1 + \\frac{n^2 a^2}{4r_{0}^2} = 1 + \\frac{(10)^2 (0.30)^2}{4(2.5)^2} = 1 + \\frac{100 \\times 0.09}{4 \\times 6.25} = 1 + \\frac{9}{25} = 1 + 0.36 = 1.36\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the effective surface area $A_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx A_{0} \\times (\\text{Correction Factor}) = 175\\pi \\times 1.36 = 238\\pi\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 238 \\times 3.14159265... \\approx 747.69905... \\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nA_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 747.7\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2\n$$",
