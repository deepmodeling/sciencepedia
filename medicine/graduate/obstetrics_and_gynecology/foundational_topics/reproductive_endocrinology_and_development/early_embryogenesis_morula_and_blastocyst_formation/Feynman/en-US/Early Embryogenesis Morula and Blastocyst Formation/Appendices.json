            "problem": "An investigator studies lineage segregation during human preimplantation development. Consider the following well-tested facts that can be taken as a starting point. In the compacted morula, outer cells acquire an apical domain and reduced cell-cell contact on their free surface, which suppresses the Hippo signaling pathway (HIPPO) so that Yes-associated protein $1$ (YAP$1$) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR$1$) enter the nucleus and partner with TEA domain transcription factor $4$ (TEAD$4$) to drive trophectoderm (TE) lineage genes such as caudal type homeobox $2$ (CDX$2$) and GATA binding protein $3$ (GATA$3$). By contrast, inner cells experience high cell-cell contact that activates HIPPO, leading to phosphorylation by large tumor suppressor kinase $1/2$ (LATS$1/2$), cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP$1$/TAZ, and repression of TEAD$4$-dependent transcription; this permits maintenance of inner cell mass (ICM) pluripotency genes including POU class $5$ homeobox $1$ (POU$5$F$1$, also called OCT$4$), SRY-box transcription factor $2$ (SOX$2$), and Nanog homeobox (NANOG). Formation of a blastocoel cavity requires a continuous TE epithelium with tight junctions and vectorial ion transport, including sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity, to drive fluid accumulation.\n\nAn experimental construct encoding a constitutively active large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS) is introduced such that HIPPO signaling is hyperactivated in all blastomeres beginning at the compacted $16$-cell morula stage, without directly perturbing apical-basal polarity proteins. Embryos are cultured for approximately $24$ hours, the window when a control would normally form an early blastocyst.\n\nWhich outcome best predicts the fate decision and marker expression profile of these embryos under this manipulation?\n\nA. A uniform inner cell mass-like fate predominates with failure of trophectoderm specification; blastocoel does not form. Nuclear YAP$1$/TAZ are lost in all cells, TEA domain transcription factor $4$ targets are downregulated, and pluripotency markers POU$5$F$1$ (OCT$4$), SOX$2$, and NANOG are maintained or increased, while trophectoderm markers CDX$2$ and GATA$3$ are reduced.\n\nB.

Marker expression and YAP$1$/TAZ localization mirror controls despite HIPPO hyperactivation in all cells.\n\nD. Compaction fails and embryos arrest prior to epithelialization due to p$53$-mediated apoptosis; both inner cell mass and trophectoderm markers are broadly reduced without selective effects on YAP$1$/TAZ or TEA domain transcription factor $4$ activity.\n\nE. Trophectoderm differentiates normally but the blastocoel fails to form solely because ion transport is impaired; CDX$2$ and GATA$3$ remain high while POU$5$F$1$ (OCT$4$), SOX$2$, and NANOG remain low, and YAP$1/TAZ$ are nuclear in outer cells despite global HIPPO hyperactivation.",
            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe problem provides the following facts and experimental conditions:\n\n**Background Principles:**\n1.  **Outer Cells (Morula):** In the compacted morula, outer cells have an apical domain and reduced cell-cell contact on their free surface.\n2.  **Hippo Pathway in Outer Cells:** This position suppresses the Hippo signaling pathway (HIPPO).\n3.  **YAP/TAZ & TEAD4 in Outer Cells:** Suppressed HIPPO allows Yes-associated protein $1$ (YAP$1$) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) to enter the nucleus and partner with TEA domain transcription factor $4$ (TEAD$4$).\n4.  **Trophectoderm (TE) Specification:** The YAP$1$/TAZ-TEAD$4$ complex drives expression of TE lineage genes, including caudal type homeobox $2$ (CDX$2$) and GATA binding protein $3$ (GATA$3$).\n5.  **Inner Cells (Morula):** Inner cells experience high cell-cell contact.\n6.  **Hippo Pathway in Inner Cells:** This position activates the HIPPO pathway.\n7.  **YAP/TAZ Phosphorylation:** Activated HIPPO leads to phosphorylation of YAP$1$/TAZ by large tumor suppressor kinase $1/2$ (LATS$1/2$).\n8.  **YAP/TAZ Sequestration:** This phosphorylation results in the cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP$1$/TAZ.\n9.  **Inner Cell Mass (ICM) Specification:** Cytoplasmic sequestration of YAP$1$/TAZ represses TEAD$4$-dependent transcription, which permits the maintenance of ICM pluripotency genes, including POU class $5$ homeobox $1$ (POU$5$F$1$/OCT$4$), SRY-box transcription factor $2$ (SOX$2$), and Nanog homeobox (NANOG).\n10. **Blastocoel Formation:** This process requires a continuous TE epithelium with tight junctions and vectorial ion transport to drive fluid accumulation.\n\n**Experimental Setup:**\n1.  **Perturbation:** An experimental construct encoding a constitutively active large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS) is introduced into all blastomeres.\n2.  **Effect:** This causes HIPPO signaling to be hyperactivated in all blastomeres.\n3.  **Timing:** The perturbation begins at the compacted $16$-cell morula stage.\n4.  **Control:** The experiment explicitly states that apical-basal polarity proteins are not directly perturbed.\n5.  **Duration:** Embryos are cultured for approximately $24$ hours.\n\n**Question:**\nPredict the outcome regarding the fate decision and marker expression profile of the manipulated embryos.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the well-established \"positional model\" of the first cell fate decision in mammalian embryogenesis, where the Hippo signaling pathway acts as the key transducer of inside-outside positional information. The roles of LATS, YAP$1$/TAZ, TEAD$4$, and the downstream lineage markers (CDX$2$, GATA$3$ for TE; POU$5$F$1$, SOX$2$, NANOG for ICM) are all factually and scientifically correct. The mechanism of blastocoel formation is also accurately described.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear initial state (compacted morula), a specific and well-defined perturbation (constitutively active LATS), and a clear downstream pathway. It asks for the logical consequence of this perturbation based on the provided principles. A unique, stable outcome can be deduced.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement is internally consistent, scientifically sound, and provides sufficient information to derive a unique solution based on the principles of developmental biology and signal transduction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe core of the problem lies in understanding the consequences of globally hyperactivating Hippo (HIPPO) signaling by introducing a constitutively active large tumor suppressor kinase (LATS) in all blastomeres of a compacted morula.\n\n1.  **Analyze the Perturbation's Mechanism:** The problem states that a constitutively active LATS is introduced, leading to HIPPO signaling hyperactivation. According to the provided principles, LATS is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating YAP$1$ and TAZ. A \"constitutively active\" enzyme is always on, regardless of upstream regulatory signals.\n\n2.  **Trace the Signaling Cascade:**\n    *   Normally, in outer cells, apical domains and reduced cell contact suppress the HIPPO pathway, which would mean LATS is inactive.\n    *   However, the experimental introduction of a *constitutively active* LATS bypasses this upstream suppression. LATS will be active in *all* cells, including the outer ones, irrespective of their position.\n    *   Active LATS phosphorylates YAP$1$/TAZ.\n    *   Phosphorylated YAP$1$/TAZ are sequestered in the cytoplasm and cannot enter the nucleus. This effect will now happen in all cells of the embryo.\n\n3.  **Determine the Impact on Gene Expression and Cell Fate:**\n    *   Nuclear YAP$1$/TAZ are required to act as coactivators for the transcription factor TEAD$4$.\n    *   Since YAP$1$/TAZ are now confined to the cytoplasm in all blastomeres, TEAD$4$-dependent transcription is repressed globally.\n    *   The problem states that TEAD$4$ drives TE lineage genes like $CDX2$ and $GATA3$. Therefore, the expression of these TE markers will be repressed or fail to initiate in all cells.\n    *   Simultaneously, the problem states that repression of TEAD$4$-dependent transcription \"permits maintenance of ICM pluripotency genes\" such as $POU5F1$ (OCT$4$), $SOX2$, and $NANOG$.\n    *   This means that all cells in the embryo, both inner and outer, will be forced into a molecular state characteristic of the inner cell mass (ICM). They will fail to specify the trophectoderm (TE) lineage and will instead maintain or adopt an ICM-like fate, expressing pluripotency markers.\n\n4.  **Predict the Morphological Outcome:**\n    *   The problem states that blastocoel formation requires a \"continuous TE epithelium with tight junctions and vectorial ion transport\".\n    *   Since TE specification fails, a functional, sealed epithelium cannot form.\n    *   Without this epithelium, the necessary conditions for fluid accumulation (ion transport into a sealed space) are not met.\n    *   Therefore, the embryo will fail to form a blastocoel cavity. The embryo will likely remain as a compacted, morula-like ball of cells, all with an ICM identity.\n\n**Summary of Prediction:** The experimental manipulation forces all blastomeres into an ICM-like fate by preventing nuclear localization of YAP$1$/TAZ. This leads to repression of TE genes ($CDX2$, $GATA3$) and maintenance of pluripotency genes ($POU5F1$, $SOX2$, $NANOG$) throughout the embryo. As a direct consequence of the failure to form a TE, the blastocoel cavity will not form.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. A uniform inner cell mass-like fate predominates with failure of trophectoderm specification; blastocoel does not form. Nuclear YAP$1$/TAZ are lost in all cells, TEA domain transcription factor $4$ targets are downregulated, and pluripotency markers POU$5$F$1$ (OCT$4$), SOX$2$, and NANOG are maintained or increased, while trophectoderm markers CDX$2$ and GATA$3$ are reduced.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option aligns perfectly with the derived prediction. Global LATS activation leads to cytoplasmic sequestration (loss of nuclear) YAP$1$/TAZ in all cells. This represses TEAD$4$ targets ($CDX2$, $GATA3$), preventing TE specification and causing all cells to adopt an ICM-like fate (maintaining $POU5F1$, $SOX2$, $NANOG$). The absence of a TE prevents blastocoel formation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Trophectoderm specification expands at the expense of the inner cell mass; an enlarged blastocoel forms. Nuclear YAP$1$/TAZ and TEA domain transcription factor $4$ activity increase globally, elevating CDX$2$ and GATA$3$ while suppressing POU$5$F$1$ (OCT$4$), SOX$2$, and NANOG.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This describes the opposite phenotype. This outcome would be expected from *inhibiting* the HIPPO/LATS pathway, which would lead to global nuclear YAP$1$/TAZ localization and universal TE specification. The experimental setup involves hyperactivation, not inhibition.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. A normal mosaic is preserved with outer cells adopting trophectoderm and inner cells forming inner cell mass; a blastocoel forms with proper epithelialization. Marker expression and YAP$1/TAZ$ localization mirror controls despite HIPPO hyperactivation in all cells.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option claims the manipulation has no effect. This is biologically implausible. A constitutively active kinase is a potent perturbation designed to override normal signaling. The system is not expected to be robust to a global hyperactivation of a key pathway component like LATS. The positional cues in outer cells cannot override a perpetually active LATS enzyme.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Compaction fails and embryos arrest prior to epithelialization due to p$53$-mediated apoptosis; both inner cell mass and trophectoderm markers are broadly reduced without selective effects on YAP$1$/TAZ$ or TEA domain transcription factor $4$ activity.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** The experiment begins at the \"compacted $16$-cell morula stage,\" so compaction has already occurred. Furthermore, the primary effect of LATS hyperactivation is a specific, selective effect on YAP$1$/TAZ phosphorylation and localization. This option posits a non-selective apoptotic effect for which no basis is given in the problem statement, and it incorrectly claims there are no selective effects on the YAP$1$/TAZ pathway, which is the direct target of the perturbation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. Trophectoderm differentiates normally but the blastocoel fails to form solely because ion transport is impaired; CDX$2$ and GATA$3$ remain high while POU$5$F$1$ (OCT$4$), SOX$2$, and NANOG remain low, and YAP$1/TAZ$ are nuclear in outer cells despite global HIPPO hyperactivation.**\n\n-   **Analysis:** This option contains a fundamental contradiction. It states that TE differentiates normally (which requires nuclear YAP$1/TAZ$) \"despite global HIPPO hyperactivation\". This is impossible based on the provided mechanism, as LATS hyperactivation *prevents* nuclear localization of YAP$1/TAZ$. Therefore, TE cannot differentiate normally. The failure of blastocoel formation is a consequence of the failure of TE specification, not an independent defect in ion transport.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains the necessary information to derive a solution from first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n- **Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n- **Action:** Proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe formation of the blastocoel, a process known as cavitation, is driven by the accumulation of fluid within the center of the morula. This process can be understood by applying the provided principles.\n\n1.  **Establishment of a Sealed Epithelium:** At the compacted morula stage, the outer cells, which form the trophectoderm (TE), establish apical-basal polarity and form tight junctions (TJs). These TJs create a seal, separating the inner environment of the embryo from the external medium. This is a prerequisite for accumulating fluid.\n\n2.  **Generation of an Osmotic Gradient:** Fluid accumulation is not a passive process; it must be driven by an osmotic gradient. According to the provided principles, water flux ($J_w$) is proportional to the osmotic pressure difference ($\\Delta \\Pi$). To drive water into the nascent blastocoel, the osmolar concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) inside the cavity must be higher than that of the external medium.\n\n3.  **Role of the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase:** The creation of this osmotic gradient is the primary role of active ion transport. In polarized epithelia like the TE, the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is typically localized to the basolateral membrane. In the context of the blastocyst, the basolateral membrane of a TE cell is the one facing the interior of the embryo (the nascent blastocoel). The apical membrane faces the external culture medium.\n    - The $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase actively pumps $3$ $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions *out* of the TE cells. Due to its basolateral localization, these $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ ions are pumped *into* the intercellular spaces and the forming blastocoel cavity.\n    - This pumping action maintains a low intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ concentration.\n    - This low intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ creates a steep electrochemical gradient favoring the entry of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ from the external medium into the TE cells through transporters (e.g., channels, exchangers) located on the apical membrane.\n    - The net result is a trans-epithelial transport of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ from the outside medium, across the TE cell layer, and into the blastocoel.\n\n4.  **Water Flux:** The accumulation of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ (and accompanying anions like $\\mathrm{Cl}^-$, which move to maintain charge neutrality) increases the osmolar concentration ($C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$) within the blastocoel. This creates a positive osmotic pressure difference, $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$. According to the water flux equation, $J_w = L_p \\, (\\Delta \\Pi - \\Delta P)$, this osmotic gradient drives water across the TE epithelium (facilitated by aquaporins) and into the cavity, causing it to form and expand.\n\n### Prediction of Ouabain's Effect\n\nOuabain directly and specifically inhibits the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase.\n\n-   **Effect on Blastocoel Initiation:** If ouabain is added to a pre-cavitating morula, the basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-pumps are inhibited. This immediately halts the primary mechanism for pumping $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ into the nascent blastocoel. Without this active transport, a trans-epithelial solute gradient cannot be established. Therefore, $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ inside will not rise above $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ outside, meaning $\\Delta \\Pi$ will remain at or near $0$. With no osmotic driving force, there will be no net water influx ($J_w \\approx 0$), and cavitation will fail to initiate.\n\n-   **Effect on a Pre-existing Blastocoel:** If a blastocoel has already formed, there is an existing high concentration of solutes within it, resulting in $\\Delta \\Pi > 0$. This osmotic pressure is balanced by the outward hydrostatic pressure ($\\Delta P > 0$) exerted by the stretched TE layer. When ouabain is added, the active pumping of $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ into the blastocoel ceases. The solute gradient ($\\Delta \\Pi$) is no longer maintained. Solutes will slowly leak out of the blastocoel across the TE (no epithelium is perfectly impermeable), causing $\\Delta \\Pi$ to decay toward $0$. The water flux equation becomes $J_w = L_p \\, (\\Delta \\Pi - \\Delta P)$. As $\\Delta \\Pi \\to 0$, the equation simplifies to $J_w \\approx L_p \\, (-\\Delta P)$. Since the hydrostatic pressure $\\Delta P$ is positive, the water flux $J_w$ becomes negative, signifying that water will flow *out* of the blastocoel, driven by the elastic recoil of the TE. This leads to the collapse of the blastocoel.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Blastocoel initiation fails when ouabain is added before cavitation, and any pre-existing blastocoel promptly collapses when ouabain is added after cavitation; TJs remain structurally intact, but inhibition of basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase in TE prevents trans-epithelial $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ accumulation, reduces $\\Delta \\Pi$, drives $J_w \\to 0$ or negative relative to $\\Delta P$, and halts or reverses fluid accumulation.**\nThis option provides a complete and accurate description of the consequences derived from first principles. It correctly identifies the failure of initiation and collapse of an existing cavity. It correctly attributes this to the inhibition of the basolateral $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase, the resultant failure to generate a trans-epithelial $\\mathrm{Na}^+$ gradient, the reduction of $\\Delta \\Pi$, and the consequent effect on water flux $J_w$.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Blastocoel initiation accelerates and expansion increases because pump inhibition elevates intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$, causing global cell swelling that secondarily increases paracellular leak into the blastocoel; the resulting higher $C_{\\mathrm{osm}}$ in the cavity raises $\\Delta \\Pi$ and augments $J_w$.**\nThis reasoning is flawed. While pump inhibition does elevate intracellular $\\mathrm{Na}^+$, causing cell swelling, the claim that this leads to a productive paracellular leak is incorrect. The TJs are explicitly stated to *restrict* paracellular flux. A general increase in leakiness would be just as likely to dissipate any existing gradient as to create one. This mechanism is inefficient and contrary to the established primary role of trans-epithelial transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Blastocoel initiation and expansion are largely unaffected; the principal effect of ouabain is on late-stage zona pellucida hatching via reduced TE contractility, so cavitation proceeds normally but embryos fail to hatch despite normal fluid transport.**\nThis is incorrect. It wrongly claims that the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is not essential for cavitation. As derived above, the pump is the central engine for creating the osmotic gradient that drives fluid accumulation. Its inhibition would have a profound and immediate effect on blastocoel formation and maintenance, not just a downstream effect on hatching.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compaction at the $8$-cell stage is arrested due to direct inhibition of E-cadherin by ouabain, but once compaction occurs, cavitation and blastocoel expansion proceed normally because $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is dispensable for fluid accumulation across a sealed TE.**\nThis option contains multiple errors. The problem begins at the $16$-cell stage, making events at the $8$-cell stage irrelevant. More importantly, ouabain does not directly inhibit E-cadherin. The central claim that the $\\mathrm{Na}^+/\\mathrm{K}^+$-ATPase is \"dispensable\" is fundamentally wrong and contradicts the provided principles of epithelial transport.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Blastocoel initiation occurs but is delayed; ouabain primarily disrupts TE polarity rather than ion transport, so the embryo compensates via paracellular water entry through TJs, eventually achieving normal expansion without a trans-epithelial osmotic gradient.**\nThis option is incorrect. Ouabain's primary, direct action is on ion transport, not polarity. The idea that compensation occurs via \"paracellular water entry through TJs\" contradicts their function as a barrier. The assertion that expansion can occur \"without a trans-epithelial osmotic gradient\" violates the physical principle of osmosis, which is explicitly given as the mechanism for water movement.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

Assume the following well-tested relationships and constants hold at $37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- The acid dissociation of carbonic acid satisfies $K_{a} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}$, with $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}K_{a} = 6.1$.\n- The relation between dissolved carbon dioxide and its hydrated form is approximated by $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}] \\approx \\alpha\\,P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, where $\\alpha = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$ and $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.\n- The definition $pH = -\\log_{10}[\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$ applies.\n\nUsing only these principles, determine the required incubator carbon dioxide partial pressure $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to achieve $pH=7.3$ in the medium with $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 25\\,\\mathrm{mM}$. Round your final result to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{mmHg}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and provides all necessary information to determine the required partial pressure of carbon dioxide, $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The solution relies on the principles of chemical equilibrium as described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which can be derived from the provided relationships.\n\nThe starting point is the expression for the acid dissociation constant, $K_a$, of carbonic acid ($\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}$):\n$$K_{a} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}$$\nTo relate this to $pH$, we take the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}\\right)$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, the right side can be expanded:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_{a}) = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}]) - \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $pH = -\\log_{10}([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$ and $pK_{a} = -\\log_{10}(K_{a})$. Substituting these definitions into the equation yields the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:\n$$pK_{a} = pH - \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for $pH$:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]}\\right)$$\nThe problem provides the relationship between the concentration of dissolved carbonic acid, $[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}]$, and the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$:\n$$[\\mathrm{H}_{2}\\mathrm{CO}_{3}] \\approx \\alpha\\,P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation gives:\n$$pH = pK_{a} + \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha\\,P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\\right)$$\nOur goal is to solve for $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. We begin by isolating the logarithm term:\n$$pH - pK_{a} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha\\,P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\\right)$$\nTo eliminate the logarithm, we take $10$ to the power of both sides:\n$$10^{(pH - pK_{a})} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha\\,P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}$$\nFinally, we rearrange the equation algebraically to solve for $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} = \\dfrac{[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}]}{\\alpha \\cdot 10^{(pH - pK_{a})}}$$\nNow we can substitute the given values into this expression. The problem states:\n- $pH = 7.3$\n- $pK_{a} = 6.1$\n- $[\\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}] = 25\\,\\mathrm{mM} = 25\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} = \\dfrac{25\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}}{(0.03\\,\\mathrm{mmol}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}^{-1}) \\cdot 10^{(7.3 - 6.1)}}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the exponent:\n$$7.3 - 6.1 = 1.2$$\nSo the equation becomes:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} = \\dfrac{25}{0.03 \\cdot 10^{1.2}}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe term $10^{1.2}$ is calculated as:\n$$10^{1.2} \\approx 15.84893$$\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\approx \\dfrac{25}{0.03 \\cdot 15.84893}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\approx \\dfrac{25}{0.4754679}\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\approx 52.5804\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\approx 52.6\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThis is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide required in the incubator to maintain the culture medium at the target $pH$ of $7.3$.",
