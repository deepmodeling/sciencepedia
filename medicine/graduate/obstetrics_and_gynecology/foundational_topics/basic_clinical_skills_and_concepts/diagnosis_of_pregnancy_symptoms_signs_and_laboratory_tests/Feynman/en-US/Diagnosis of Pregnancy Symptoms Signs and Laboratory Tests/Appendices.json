            "problem": "A hospital laboratory uses a qualitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) immunoassay to support the diagnosis of early pregnancy. The qualitative decision rule is that a patient is classified as \"pregnant\" if the measured serum hCG is at or above a fixed cutoff of $25$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, and \"not pregnant\" otherwise. Analytical imprecision of the assay near the cutoff is characterized by a normally distributed measurement error with zero mean and a standard deviation equal to the stated imprecision, namely $\\sigma = 10$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$.\n\nUse the following fundamental bases:\n- The measured concentration $X$ can be modeled as $X = h + \\epsilon$, where $h$ is the patient's true serum hCG concentration and $\\epsilon$ is the analytical error.\n- The analytical error $\\epsilon$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$, written $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma^{2})$.\n\nFor a patient whose true serum hCG is $h = 24$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, derive from first principles the probability that the qualitative decision rule will classify the patient as \"pregnant\" (that is, $X \\geq 25$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) solely due to analytical imprecision.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes a standard scenario in clinical laboratory science involving measurement uncertainty and decision thresholds.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that a patient with a true serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration of $h = 24 \\, \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ will be classified as \"pregnant\" based on a qualitative test with a cutoff of $25 \\, \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$.\n\nThe measured concentration, $X$, is modeled as the sum of the true concentration, $h$, and the analytical error, $\\epsilon$.\n$$X = h + \\epsilon$$\nThe analytical error $\\epsilon$ is given to follow a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $\\sigma = 10 \\, \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. This is denoted as $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nSince $h$ is a constant for this specific patient ($h=24$), the measured concentration $X$ is a random variable whose distribution is determined by the distribution of $\\epsilon$. The expected value (mean) of $X$ is:\n$$E[X] = E[h + \\epsilon] = E[h] + E[\\epsilon] = h + 0 = h$$\nThe variance of $X$ is:\n$$Var(X) = Var(h + \\epsilon) = Var(\\epsilon) = \\sigma^2$$\nTherefore, the measured concentration $X$ is also a normally distributed random variable with mean $h$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, which we write as $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(h, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nSubstituting the given values for this patient, we have $h=24$ and $\\sigma=10$. Thus, the distribution of the measured concentration is:\n$$X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(24, 10^2)$$\nThe patient is classified as \"pregnant\" if the measured concentration $X$ is at or above the cutoff value of $25 \\, \\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. We need to calculate the probability $P(X \\geq 25)$.\n\nTo find this probability, we standardize the random variable $X$ by transforming it into the standard normal variable $Z$, which has a mean of $0$ and a standard deviation of $1$. The transformation is:\n$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}$$\nwhere $\\mu_X = h = 24$ and $\\sigma_X = \\sigma = 10$.\n\nWe apply this transformation to the inequality:\n$$P(X \\geq 25) = P\\left(\\frac{X - 24}{10} \\geq \\frac{25 - 24}{10}\\right)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$P\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{1}{10}\\right) = P(Z \\geq 0.1)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, which gives the probability $P(Z \\leq z)$. The probability $P(Z \\geq 0.1)$ can be calculated as:\n$$P(Z \\geq 0.1) = 1 - P(Z < 0.1) = 1 - \\Phi(0.1)$$\nNote that for a continuous distribution, $P(Z < 0.1) = P(Z \\leq 0.1)$.\nUsing a standard normal table or computational software, the value of $\\Phi(0.1)$ is approximately $0.5398278$.\nTherefore, the probability of misclassification is:\n$$P(X \\geq 25) \\approx 1 - 0.5398278 = 0.4601722$$\nThe problem requires the final probability to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$0.4601722 \\approx 0.4602$$\nThis result indicates that there is approximately a $46.02\\%$ chance that this patient, whose true hCG level is just below the cutoff, will be classified as pregnant due to random analytical imprecision.\n\nRegarding the second part of the question, a scientifically sound confirmatory approach to minimize misclassification for results near the cutoff is to perform serial quantitative testing. This involves repeating the hCG measurement after a specified time interval, typically $48$ to $72$ hours. In a viable early pregnancy, hCG levels are expected to double approximately every $48$ hours. Observing a significant rise in the quantitative hCG concentration provides strong evidence for a viable pregnancy and distinguishes it from a static low level caused by other physiological conditions or from a single anomalous result due to analytical imprecision.",

This practice problem focuses on the quantitative analysis of serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, a fundamental tool for monitoring early pregnancy viability .

            "problem": "A patient presents with a pregnancy of unknown location. Serial quantitative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) measurements are obtained at equal intervals of $48$ hours: at time $t_{0} = 0$ hours, the serum hCG is $320$ $\\text{mIU/mL}$; at $t_{1} = 48$ hours, it is $520$ $\\text{mIU/mL}$; and at $t_{2} = 96$ hours, it is $780$ $\\text{mIU/mL}$. Use the following foundational information as the basis for analysis.\n\n1. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a trophoblastic hormone whose early first-trimester trajectory in a viable intrauterine gestation commonly rises over successive $48$-hour intervals; the fractional change from a prior value $A$ to a later value $B$ is defined as $(B - A)/A$.\n2. Contemporary evidence synthesized from prospective cohorts indicates that, to avoid misclassifying potentially viable intrauterine pregnancies, a conservative lower bound for the expected $48$-hour fractional rise is approximately $0.35$ in early gestation under standard laboratory conditions.\n\nTasks:\n- Compute the fractional increases over each $48$-hour interval using the definition in item $1$.\n- Using the benchmark in item $2$, identify whether the trajectory is consistent with potential viability under this conservative lower bound by comparing each observed fractional increase to $0.35$.\n- Finally, define a unitless “consistency ratio” as follows: identify the smallest of the two observed $48$-hour fractional increases, and then compute its ratio to the benchmark fractional increase of $0.35$.

It presents a standard clinical scenario in obstetrics concerning the interpretation of serial human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels in a pregnancy of unknown location. The provided data, definitions, and tasks are clear, complete, and mutually consistent, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. There are no violations of fundamental principles, factual inaccuracies, or logical contradictions. The problem may therefore be solved as stated.\n\nLet the serum hCG concentrations at times $t_0 = 0$ hours, $t_1 = 48$ hours, and $t_2 = 96$ hours be denoted by $H_0$, $H_1$, and $H_2$, respectively.\nThe given values are:\n$H_0 = 320 \\text{ mIU/mL}$\n$H_1 = 520 \\text{ mIU/mL}$\n$H_2 = 780 \\text{ mIU/mL}$\n\nThe problem defines the fractional change from a prior value $A$ to a later value $B$ as $\\frac{B - A}{A}$. We must compute this change for the two consecutive $48$-hour intervals.\n\nFor the first interval, from $t_0$ to $t_1$, the fractional increase, which we will denote as $R_1$, is:\n$$R_1 = \\frac{H_1 - H_0}{H_0} = \\frac{520 - 320}{320} = \\frac{200}{320} = \\frac{20}{32} = \\frac{5}{8}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$R_1 = 0.625$$\n\nFor the second interval, from $t_1$ to $t_2$, the fractional increase, which we will denote as $R_2$, is:\n$$R_2 = \\frac{H_2 - H_1}{H_1} = \\frac{780 - 520}{520} = \\frac{260}{520} = \\frac{26}{52} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nAs a decimal, this is:\n$$R_2 = 0.5$$\n\nNext, we compare these observed fractional increases to the conservative lower bound benchmark given as $R_{benchmark} = 0.35$.\nFor the first interval: $R_1 = 0.625$, which is greater than $0.35$.\nFor the second interval: $R_2 = 0.5$, which is also greater than $0.35$.\nThus, the hCG trajectory over both measurement periods is consistent with the specified lower bound for a potentially viable intrauterine pregnancy.\n\nFinally, we are asked to compute a \"consistency ratio\". This is defined as the ratio of the smallest of the two observed $48$-hour fractional increases to the benchmark fractional increase of $0.35$.\n\nFirst, we identify the smallest observed fractional increase, $R_{observed, min}$:\n$$R_{observed, min} = \\min(R_1, R_2) = \\min(0.625, 0.5) = 0.5$$\n\nNow, we compute the consistency ratio, $C_{ratio}$:\n$$C_{ratio} = \\frac{R_{observed, min}}{R_{benchmark}} = \\frac{0.5}{0.35}$$\nTo compute the exact value, we can express the decimals as fractions:\n$$C_{ratio} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{35}{100}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{\\frac{7}{20}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{20}{7} = \\frac{10}{7}$$\n\nThe problem requires this ratio to be reported as a single unitless decimal, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{ratio} = \\frac{10}{7} \\approx 1.4285714...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we examine the fifth significant figure.

Assume a setting with high-quality transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and a discriminatory zone such that a normal intrauterine gestational sac is expected to be visible when serum hCG is at or above approximately $2{,}000$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. At a measured hCG of $2{,}200$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, the TVUS is nondiagnostic: there is no intrauterine gestational sac and no definitive adnexal mass.\n\nYou will use probability theory and Bayes’ rule, starting from core definitions of conditional probability and the law of total probability, to compute the posterior probability of ectopic pregnancy.\n\nModel the diagnostic space as three mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses: ectopic pregnancy ($E$), viable intrauterine pregnancy ($V$), and failing pregnancy ($F$) (including spontaneous abortion or resolving pregnancy of unknown location).

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, providing a complete set of prior probabilities and conditional probabilities (likelihoods) to compute a posterior probability using Bayes' rule. The provided numerical values are consistent with established concepts in obstetrics and gynecology, such as the use of a discriminatory zone for serum hCG levels in conjunction with transvaginal ultrasound.\n\nThe objective is to compute the posterior probability of ectopic pregnancy ($E$), given the evidence of a nondiagnostic transvaginal ultrasound ($U$) at a serum hCG level of $2{,}200$ $\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. This probability is denoted as $P(E \\mid U)$.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of conditional probability. For any two events $A$ and $B$ where $P(B) > 0$, the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is:\n$$P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\nApplying this definition to our specific problem, the posterior probability of an ectopic pregnancy $E$ given the nondiagnostic ultrasound finding $U$ is:\n$$P(E \\mid U) = \\frac{P(E \\cap U)}{P(U)}$$\nThe term in the numerator, $P(E \\cap U)$, is the joint probability of both an ectopic pregnancy and a nondiagnostic ultrasound occurring. This can be expressed using the multiplication rule of probability, which is a rearrangement of the conditional probability definition: $P(A \\cap B) = P(B \\mid A)P(A)$. Thus, we can write:\n$$P(E \\cap U) = P(U \\mid E) P(E)$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for $P(E \\mid U)$ gives the common form of Bayes' rule:\n$$P(E \\mid U) = \\frac{P(U \\mid E) P(E)}{P(U)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(U)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence (a nondiagnostic ultrasound). The problem states that the diagnostic space is partitioned into three mutually exclusive and exhaustive hypotheses: ectopic pregnancy ($E$), viable intrauterine pregnancy ($V$), and failing pregnancy ($F$). The condition of being exhaustive implies that $P(E) + P(V) + P(F) = 1$. Let's verify this with the given priors: $0.15 + 0.55 + 0.30 = 1.00$. This confirms the partition is complete.\n\nWe can express the total probability $P(U)$ using the Law of Total Probability, which states that if $\\{H_1, H_2, \\dots, H_n\\}$ is a partition of the sample space, then for any event $A$:\n$$P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} P(A \\mid H_i) P(H_i)$$\nApplying this law to our problem, with the evidence $U$ and the partition $\\{E, V, F\\}$:\n$$P(U) = P(U \\mid E)P(E) + P(U \\mid V)P(V) + P(U \\mid F)P(F)$$\nNow we can substitute this full expression for $P(U)$ into the denominator of our Bayes' rule formula:\n$$P(E \\mid U) = \\frac{P(U \\mid E) P(E)}{P(U \\mid E)P(E) + P(U \\mid V)P(V) + P(U \\mid F)P(F)}$$\nWe are given the following values:\nPrior probabilities:\n- $P(E) = 0.15$\n- $P(V) = 0.55$\n- $P(F) = 0.30$\n\nConditional probabilities (likelihoods):\n- $P(U \\mid E) = 0.70$\n- $P(U \\mid V) = 0.12$\n- $P(U \\mid F) = 0.65$\n\nWe substitute these values into the formula.
