This exercise moves beyond simple procedural steps to explore the underlying physics governing the Pipelle endometrial suction curette.

            "problem": "A Pipelle endometrial suction curette (PESC) is used to obtain endometrial tissue by applying negative pressure via a plunger. Consider a single steady pass in which the plunger is retracted by a stroke length $s$, creating a negative pressure of magnitude $\\Delta p$ that is approximately uniform within the cannula. The cannula has inner diameter $d$, so its inner radius is $r = d/2$ and inner cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi r^{2}$. Assume the endometrial tissue behaves as a Bingham plastic characterized by a yield stress $\\tau_{y}$, and neglect viscoelasticity, viscous plasticity, inertia, and time-dependent effects. The tissue is drawn through the side-hole at the tip and forms a cylindrical column within the cannula of length $L$.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental and well-tested bases:\n\n- The axial pressure drop per unit length in a straight cylindrical conduit under steady laminar conditions is approximately constant, so the pressure gradient is $\\Delta p / L$.\n- The wall shear stress in a straight circular tube under a uniform axial pressure gradient is $\\tau_{w} = \\frac{r}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}\\right)$.\n- For a Bingham plastic, bulk motion occurs only if the applied shear stress exceeds the yield stress, so flow can fill the tube up to the largest $L$ satisfying $\\tau_{w} \\ge \\tau_{y}$.\n\nAdditionally, the plunger stroke constrains the maximum aspirated volume to $A s$, so the filled column length cannot exceed $s$, i.e., $L \\le s$.\n\nUsing these bases, derive an expression for the realized filled length $L$ and the expected tissue volume $V$ after one pass, and then compute $V$ for the following physiologically plausible parameters:\n- Inner diameter $d = 2.5$ mm,\n- Stroke length $s = 70$ mm,\n- Vacuum pressure magnitude $\\Delta p = 4.5 \\times 10^{4}$ Pa,\n- Yield stress $\\tau_{y} = 150$ Pa.\n\nExpress the final tissue volume $V$ in milliliters (mL) and round your answer to three significant figures. Your final answer must be a single real-valued number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the realized filled length $L$ of an endometrial tissue sample collected by a Pipelle endometrial suction curette (PESC), and the corresponding tissue volume $V$. The final numerical value for $V$ must be calculated based on the provided parameters.\n\nThe problem statement provides two independent constraints on the length $L$ of the tissue column that can be drawn into the cannula. The realized length $L$ must satisfy both constraints simultaneously.\n\nFirst, we analyze the constraint imposed by the tissue's material properties. The endometrial tissue is modeled as a Bingham plastic with a yield stress $\\tau_{y}$. For the tissue to flow into the cannula, the shear stress exerted by the pressure gradient must exceed this yield stress. The wall shear stress, $\\tau_{w}$, is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\tau_{w} = \\frac{r}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the inner radius of the cannula, $\\Delta p$ is the magnitude of the negative pressure, and $L$ is the length of the tissue column over which this pressure drop occurs.\n\nThe condition for flow is $\\tau_{w} \\ge \\tau_{y}$. Substituting the expression for $\\tau_{w}$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{r}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}\\right) \\ge \\tau_{y}\n$$\nThe problem states that flow can fill the tube up to the largest $L$ satisfying this condition. This means we are looking for the maximum length, let's call it $L_{\\text{yield}}$, for which the yield stress is just overcome. We can find this by rearranging the inequality to solve for $L$:\n$$\nL \\le \\frac{r \\Delta p}{2 \\tau_{y}}\n$$\nThus, the maximum length limited by the physics of tissue yielding is:\n$$\nL_{\\text{yield}} = \\frac{r \\Delta p}{2 \\tau_{y}}\n$$\nSince the inner diameter is $d$, the radius is $r = d/2$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nL_{\\text{yield}} = \\frac{(d/2) \\Delta p}{2 \\tau_{y}} = \\frac{d \\Delta p}{4 \\tau_{y}}\n$$\n\nSecond, we consider the mechanical constraint imposed by the device itself. The plunger is retracted by a stroke length $s$. This action creates the vacuum and defines the maximum volume that can be aspirated, which is the inner cross-sectional area $A$ multiplied by the stroke length $s$.  Consequently, the length of the tissue column $L$ cannot exceed the stroke length $s$. This gives the second constraint:\n$$\nL \\le s\n$$\n\nThe actual, or realized, length $L$ of the tissue sample will be the maximum length possible that satisfies both constraints. Therefore, $L$ must be the minimum of the two upper bounds:\n$$\nL = \\min(L_{\\text{yield}}, s) = \\min\\left(\\frac{d \\Delta p}{4 \\tau_{y}}, s\\right)\n$$\nThe volume of the aspirated tissue, $V$, which is cylindrical, is the product of the inner cross-sectional area $A = \\pi r^2 = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$ and the realized length $L$.\n$$\nV = A L = \\left(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\\right) \\min\\left(\\frac{d \\Delta p}{4 \\tau_{y}}, s\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the volume. It is critical to use a consistent set of units, for which we will use the International System of Units (SI).\nThe given parameters are:\n- Inner diameter $d = 2.5$ mm $= 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n- Stroke length $s = 70$ mm $= 70 \\times 10^{-3}$ m $= 7.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ m\n- Vacuum pressure magnitude $\\Delta p = 4.5 \\times 10^{4}$ Pa\n- Yield stress $\\tau_{y} = 150$ Pa\n\nFirst, we calculate the yield-limited length, $L_{\\text{yield}}$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{yield}} = \\frac{d \\Delta p}{4 \\tau_{y}} = \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m}) (4.5 \\times 10^{4} \\text{ Pa})}{4 (150 \\text{ Pa})}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\text{yield}} = \\frac{112.5 \\text{ m} \\cdot \\text{Pa}}{600 \\text{ Pa}} = 0.1875 \\text{ m}\n$$\nNext, we compare $L_{\\text{yield}}$ with the stroke length $s$:\n$$\nL_{\\text{yield}} = 0.1875 \\text{ m}\n$$\n$$\ns = 0.070 \\text{ m}\n$$\nSince $s < L_{\\text{yield}}$ ($0.070 \\text{ m} < 0.1875 \\text{ m}$), the stroke length is the limiting factor for the length of the tissue sample. The physical movement of the plunger stops before the yield stress limitation is reached.\nTherefore, the realized length is $L = s = 7.0 \\times 10^{-2}$ m.\n\nNow, we can calculate the volume $V$:\n$$\nV = A L = \\left(\\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}\\right) s\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{\\pi (2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m})^2}{4} \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m})\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{\\pi (6.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^2)}{4} \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m})\n$$\n$$\nV = (\\pi \\times 1.5625 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ m}^2) \\times (7.0 \\times 10^{-2} \\text{ m})\n$$\n$$\nV = \\pi \\times 10.9375 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ m}^3 \\approx 3.43572 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}^3\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliliters (mL).

Before biopsy, a sterile uterine sound is used to determine the uterine cavity length and direction. Explain, from first principles grounded in uterine anatomy and iatrogenic risk minimization, why sounding is performed prior to advancing a biopsy cannula. Then, model the safety margin for insertion depth using a probabilistic approach based on measurement uncertainty and fundal tolerance, and compute the maximum planned insertion depth that achieves a specified risk target.\n\nAssume the following scientifically realistic set-up:\n- The true uterine cavity length is an unknown constant denoted $L_{t}$.\n- The measured uterine length by sounding is denoted $L_{m}$ and is modeled as $L_{m} = L_{t} + E_{m}$, where $E_{m}$ is a zero-mean, independent, approximately Gaussian error with standard deviation $\\sigma_{m}$.\n- The executed insertion depth relative to the planned mark has an implementation error $E_{i}$ (operator and device control variability), independent of $E_{m}$, zero-mean Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma_{i}$.\n- The biopsy cannula can be advanced beyond the true fundal position by up to a fundal tolerance $T$ without clinically significant risk; advancement beyond $L_{t} + T$ is considered a perforation-risk event.\n- Let the planned insertion depth be $D_{\\text{plan}} = L_{m} - s$, where $s$ is a safety back-off margin to be derived.

            "solution": "The clinical rationale for uterine sounding follows directly from uterine anatomy and iatrogenic risk minimization. The endometrial cavity has a finite length from the external cervical os to the fundus, denoted $L_{t}$. Perforation risk arises if an instrument is advanced beyond the fundal endometrium by more than a small, tolerable compression distance $T$. Sounding is performed to estimate the cavity length and direction to align subsequent instrumentation with the uterine axis, reduce insertion against the wrong wall, and set a planned depth that minimizes the probability of overshooting the fundus beyond the tolerated distance. Thus, sounding operationalizes the translation of an unknown anatomical length $L_{t}$ into a measured proxy $L_{m}$ that informs a safety margin $s$, with the aim of controlling $\\mathbb{P}\\!\\left(D_{\\text{act}} > L_{t} + T\\right)$ below a chosen threshold.\n\nWe now formalize the probabilistic model.
