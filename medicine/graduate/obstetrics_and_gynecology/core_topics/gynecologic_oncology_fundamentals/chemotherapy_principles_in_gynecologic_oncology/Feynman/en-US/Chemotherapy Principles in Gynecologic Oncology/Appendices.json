            "introduction": "Accurate chemotherapy dosing is a foundational skill in oncology, designed to balance efficacy with toxicity. A common approach for many cytotoxic agents is to dose based on Body Surface Area ($BSA$), which provides a better estimate of metabolic mass and drug clearance than weight alone. This exercise provides essential practice in applying the Mosteller formula, a widely used method for calculating $BSA$, to determine the precise dose of paclitaxel for a patient with ovarian cancer .",

            "problem": "A 58-year-old patient with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma is planned for first-line chemotherapy with a taxane–platinum regimen. In gynecologic oncology, many cytotoxic drugs are dosed based on Body Surface Area (BSA) to normalize interpatient variability in pharmacokinetics, reflecting the empirical observation that drug clearance scales allometrically with anthropometric measures. For BSA estimation, a widely used and well-tested formula in clinical practice is the Mosteller equation. Assume dosing follows standard practice for paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, at $175\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n\nGiven the patient’s height $165\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight $80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, use the Mosteller formula $BSA=\\sqrt{(\\text{height(cm)}\\times \\text{weight(kg)})/3600}$ to compute the Body Surface Area (BSA), and then calculate the paclitaxel dose at $175\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. Round your final paclitaxel dose to four significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{mg}$.",
            "solution": "The problem poses a direct and practical calculation commonly performed in clinical oncology, specifically for the dosing of cytotoxic chemotherapy. The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It requires the application of a standard empirical formula and subsequent arithmetic to determine a patient-specific drug dose.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the patient's Body Surface Area (BSA) using the provided Mosteller formula. The given parameters are the patient's height, $H$, and weight, $W$.\n\nGiven:\nPatient height, $H = 165\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\nPatient weight, $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nThe Mosteller formula is given as:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{H \\times W}{3600}}$$\nThe units for height and weight in this formula are centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$) and kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$), respectively. The resulting BSA is in square meters ($\\mathrm{m}^{2}$). The constant $3600$ is an empirical factor that makes the units consistent.\n\nSubstituting the patient's data into the formula:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{165 \\times 80}{3600}}$$\nFirst, we compute the product in the numerator:\n$$165 \\times 80 = 13200$$\nNow, substitute this back into the BSA equation:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{13200}{3600}}$$\nThe fraction can be simplified by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by $100$:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{132}{36}}$$\nFurther simplification is possible by dividing by their greatest common divisor, which is $12$:\n$$BSA = \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{3}}$$\nThis is the exact value for the patient's BSA in $\\mathrm{m}^{2}$. For the subsequent calculation, it is preferable to use this exact form or a high-precision decimal representation to avoid premature rounding errors.\n$BSA \\approx 1.9148542\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$.\n\nThe second step is to calculate the total dose of paclitaxel. The dose is prescribed based on the calculated BSA.\nGiven:\nPrescribed dose rate, $D_{rate} = 175\\,\\mathrm{mg}/\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n\nThe total dose, $D_{total}$, is the product of the BSA and the dose rate:\n$$D_{total} = BSA \\times D_{rate}$$\nSubstituting the exact value for BSA and the given dose rate:\n$$D_{total} = \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{11}{3}}\\right) \\mathrm{m}^{2} \\times 175\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}$$\n$$D_{total} = 175 \\sqrt{\\frac{11}{3}}\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$D_{total} \\approx 175 \\times 1.9148542\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n$$D_{total} \\approx 335.0994877\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $335.0994877...$. The first four significant figures are $3$, $3$, $5$, and $0$. The fifth significant figure is $9$. Since $9 \\ge 5$, we must round up the fourth significant digit. The fourth digit, $0$, is incremented to $1$.\nTherefore, the rounded total dose is $335.1\\,\\mathrm{mg}$.",

            "introduction": "While $BSA$-based dosing is common, some drugs require more nuanced calculations that incorporate patient-specific organ function. Carboplatin, a cornerstone of treatment for gynecologic cancers, is a prime example, as its elimination is primarily dependent on renal function. This practice will guide you through the two-step process of estimating a patient's creatinine clearance using the Cockcroft–Gault equation and then applying the Calvert formula to calculate a carboplatin dose that targets a specific systemic drug exposure, or Area Under the Curve ($AUC$) .",

Her current laboratory value shows a serum creatinine of $1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$. Her actual body weight is $70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ and she is not obese. Using established pharmacokinetic principles, first estimate the patient’s creatinine clearance in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$ via the Cockcroft–Gault approach appropriate for females, and then use the standard carboplatin dosing paradigm that relates dose to the Area Under the Concentration–Time Curve (AUC) and the patient’s renal function, with a target AUC of $5\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot min/mL}$. Assume the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is approximated by the calculated creatinine clearance and that standard non-renal clearance is applicable. Provide the final carboplatin dose in $\\mathrm{mg}$. Round your final dose to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a patient-specific carboplatin dose based on renal function and a target Area Under the Concentration–Time Curve (AUC). This is a two-step process. First, the patient's renal function, quantified as creatinine clearance ($CrCl$), is estimated using the Cockcroft–Gault equation. Second, this estimate is used in the Calvert formula to determine the appropriate carboplatin dose.\n\nStep 1: Estimate Creatinine Clearance ($CrCl$)\n\nThe problem specifies using the Cockcroft–Gault equation, adjusted for a female patient, to estimate $CrCl$ in units of $\\mathrm{mL/min}$. The formula is:\n$$CrCl = \\frac{(140 - \\text{Age}) \\times \\text{Weight}}{72 \\times S_{Cr}} \\times 0.85$$\nwhere:\n- Age is in years.\n- Weight is the actual body weight in $\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- $S_{Cr}$ is the serum creatinine in $\\mathrm{mg/dL}$.\n- The factor of $0.85$ is applied for female patients.\n\nThe patient's data are provided as:\n- Age $= 62$ years\n- Weight $= 70\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Serum Creatinine ($S_{Cr}$) $= 1.2\\ \\mathrm{mg/dL}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the Cockcroft–Gault equation:\n$$CrCl = \\frac{(140 - 62) \\times 70}{72 \\times 1.2} \\times 0.85$$\n$$CrCl = \\frac{78 \\times 70}{86.4} \\times 0.85$$\n$$CrCl = \\frac{5460}{86.4} \\times 0.85$$\n$$CrCl = (63.1944\\dots) \\times 0.85$$\n$$CrCl \\approx 53.71527\\dots\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$$\nThis value represents the estimated rate of creatinine clearance.\n\nStep 2: Calculate Carboplatin Dose\n\nThe problem requires using the standard carboplatin dosing paradigm, which is the Calvert formula. This formula calculates the total dose in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) based on the target AUC and the patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The formula is:\n$$\\text{Dose (mg)} = \\text{Target AUC} \\times (\\text{GFR} + 25)$$\nwhere:\n- Target AUC is given in $\\mathrm{mg\\cdot min/mL}$.\n- GFR is the glomerular filtration rate in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n- The value $25$ is a constant representing the non-renal clearance of carboplatin in $\\mathrm{mL/min}$.\n\nThe problem states that the GFR is to be approximated by the calculated creatinine clearance ($CrCl$). Therefore, we use $\\text{GFR} \\approx CrCl = 53.71527\\dots\\ \\mathrm{mL/min}$. The target AUC is given as $5\\ \\mathrm{mg\\cdot min/mL}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the Calvert formula:\n$$\\text{Dose (mg)} = 5 \\times (53.71527\\dots + 25)$$\n$$\\text{Dose (mg)} = 5 \\times (78.71527\\dots)$$\n$$\\text{Dose (mg)} \\approx 393.57638\\dots$$\n\nThe problem asks for the final dose to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated dose is $393.57638\\dots\\ \\mathrm{mg}$. The first four significant figures are $3$, $9$, $3$, and $5$. The fifth digit is $7$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the fourth digit.\nTherefore, the rounded dose is $393.6\\ \\mathrm{mg}$.",

The patient’s body weight is $70$ $\\mathrm{kg}$. After cycle $1$, the following toxicities occur and are managed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)–based principles and standard dose-modification rules for antibody–drug conjugates:\n\n- On day $12$, the patient develops grade $2$ ocular toxicity, which is managed with ocular prophylaxis and supportive care. It resolves to grade $\\leq 1$ by day $22$.\n- On day $15$, the patient develops grade $3$ neutropenia, defined by an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) $ANC  1.0 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{L}^{-1}$.

The ANC recovers to $\\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{L}^{-1}$ by day $28$.\n\nUsing foundational principles that subsequent doses should be withheld until ocular toxicity has improved to grade $\\leq 1$ and hematologic parameters have recovered ($ANC \\geq 1.5 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\text{L}^{-1}$), determine the earliest safe day for the second dose relative to the planned day $22$ and propose a modified dosing schedule for cycle $2$ that aligns with typical dose-reduction steps for clinically significant hematologic toxicity. Then, using the core definitions of dose intensity (DI) and relative dose intensity (RDI),\n- dose intensity (DI): total delivered drug amount divided by the time interval over which it is delivered,\n- relative dose intensity (RDI): actual DI divided by planned DI,\ncompute the RDI across the first two cycles, taking the interval from the day $1$ start of cycle $1$ to the planned start of cycle $3$ (day $43$) for the planned schedule, and from the day $1$ start of cycle $1$ to the actual start of cycle $3$ for the modified schedule.

The problem states this toxicity resolved to grade $\\leq 1$ by day $22$.
