            "problem": "A tertiary obstetrics practice with an existing telemedicine program is expanding remote Blood Pressure (BP) monitoring for patients at elevated risk of Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP). To proactively identify and prioritize risks, the practice performs a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) of the monitoring workflow. The intent is to compute the Risk Priority Number (RPN) for each identified failure mode following standard FMEA principles, without relying on any shortcut formulas that are not derived from first principles.\n\nFundamental base and setup:\n- In FMEA, the composite risk for a failure mode is assessed by three ordinal ratings: severity, occurrence, and detection. The severity rating reflects the magnitude of harm to the pregnant patient and fetus if the failure mode leads to an adverse effect. The occurrence rating reflects how frequently the failure mode is expected to occur within the remote monitoring process. The detection rating reflects how likely the system is to identify the failure before causing harm; higher ratings mean poorer detectability.\n- Each rating uses a ten-level ordinal scale from $1$ to $10$ with $1$ representing the least concerning end and $10$ representing the most concerning end along its axis. For severity, $1$ means negligible harm while $10$ means catastrophic maternal-fetal harm. For occurrence, $1$ means remote likelihood while $10$ means frequent recurrence. For detection, $1$ means the failure mode is almost certainly detected before harm while $10$ means the failure mode is very unlikely to be detected before harm.\n- The program implements a set of controls designed to either reduce the likelihood of occurrence or improve detectability prior to harm. These controls are applied to the baseline ratings to obtain adjusted ratings that reflect the system after control implementation.\n\nA clinical-risk team has identified the following failure modes in the remote BP monitoring workflow for pregnant patients, each with baseline ratings and the specified control effects. After the controls are implemented, compute the adjusted Risk Priority Numbers for each failure mode, reported in the order given below.\n\nFailure modes and ratings:\n(a) Incorrect cuff size selection by the patient (small cuff on a large arm) leads to systematically elevated BP readings and potential inappropriate interventions. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{a} = 6$, occurrence $O_{a} = 5$, detection $D_{a} = 6$. Control effects: patient-facing arm-circumference guidance and training reduce occurrence by $1$ point and detection rating by $2$ points, so adjusted ratings are $O_{a}^{\\prime} = O_{a} - 1$ and $D_{a}^{\\prime} = D_{a} - 2$ with a lower bound of $1$ on adjusted ratings.\n(b) Data transmission dropout from the home BP device results in missed severe-range readings. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{b} = 9$, occurrence $O_{b} = 3$, detection $D_{b} = 8$. Control effects: automated connectivity health monitoring reduces the detection rating by $3$ points, so $D_{b}^{\\prime} = D_{b} - 3$ with a lower bound of $1$; occurrence is unchanged.\n(c) Measurement taken shortly after caffeine intake causes transient elevation and false alarms. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{c} = 5$, occurrence $O_{c} = 6$, detection $D_{c} = 5$. Control effects: targeted education about pre-measurement conditions reduces occurrence by $2$ points, so $O_{c}^{\\prime} = O_{c} - 2$ with a lower bound of $1$; detection is unchanged.\n(d) Alert routing misconfiguration causes delayed clinician review of critical BP alerts. Baseline ratings: severity $S_{d} = 8$, occurrence $O_{d} = 2$, detection $D_{d} = 7$. Control effects: weekly alert routing audits and redundant notification channels reduce occurrence by $1$ point and detection rating by $4$ points, so $O_{d}^{\\prime} = O_{d} - 1$ and $D_{d}^{\\prime} = D_{d} - 4$ with a lower bound of $1$ on adjusted ratings.\n\nTask:\n- Using the foundational FMEA rationale for combining severity, occurrence, and detection into a composite prioritization metric, compute the adjusted Risk Priority Number for each failure mode after the specified controls are implemented.\n- Report the final four adjusted RPN values in the order $(a), (b), (c), (d)$.\n- Express the final answer as an ordered row matrix of four integers, with no units. No rounding is necessary, as the ratings are integers and the calculation is exact.",
            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides data for a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) in a telemedicine obstetrics context. The goal is to compute the adjusted Risk Priority Number (RPN) for four identified failure modes.\n\n**General Principles:**\n- Risk is assessed using three ordinal ratings: Severity ($S$), Occurrence ($O$), and Detection ($D$).\n- Each rating is on a scale from $1$ to $10$.\n- The RPN is a composite metric derived from these three ratings.\n- Controls are applied to baseline ratings to obtain adjusted ratings, denoted with a prime (e.g., $O^{\\prime}$).\n- Adjusted ratings have a lower bound of $1$.\n\n**Failure Mode (a): Incorrect cuff size**\n- Baseline ratings: $S_{a} = 6$, $O_{a} = 5$, $D_{a} = 6$.\n- Control effects: Occurrence is reduced by $1$ point, and detection is reduced by $2$ points.\n- Adjusted rating formulas: $O_{a}^{\\prime} = O_{a} - 1$, $D_{a}^{\\prime} = D_{a} - 2$.\n\n**Failure Mode (b): Data transmission dropout**\n- Baseline ratings: $S_{b} = 9$, $O_{b} = 3$, $D_{b} = 8$.\n- Control effects: Detection is reduced by $3$ points. Occurrence is unchanged.\n- Adjusted rating formula: $D_{b}^{\\prime} = D_{b} - 3$.\n\n**Failure Mode (c): Measurement after caffeine**\n- Baseline ratings: $S_{c} = 5$, $O_{c} = 6$, $D_{c} = 5$.\n- Control effects: Occurrence is reduced by $2$ points.

The medical context is realistic and provides a practical application for the methodology. The principles are logically and factually sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary initial data (baseline ratings) and clear rules for calculating the adjusted ratings and the final RPNs. The task is specific, and a unique solution exists.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise and unbiased. The definitions of severity, occurrence, and detection are standard for FMEA. The problem is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary formulas for adjustments and the definition of the components of the RPN are provided or are standard first principles of the FMEA method, as requested. The lower bound of $1$ for ratings is explicitly stated, preventing ambiguity.\n\nThe phrase \"without relying on any shortcut formulas that are not derived from first principles\" directs the solver to use the foundational definition of the RPN. The standard definition, $RPN = S \\times O \\times D$, is the first principle for combining these ratings into a composite score. It is not a shortcut. The problem is therefore consistent and solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe foundational principle of FMEA for calculating the Risk Priority Number (RPN) is the multiplicative combination of the three risk components: Severity ($S$), Occurrence ($O$), and Detection ($D$). This ensures that a high score in any single component significantly increases the overall risk priority. The formula is:\n$$RPN = S \\times O \\times D$$\nThe problem requires the calculation of the *adjusted* RPN for each failure mode, which we will denote as $RPN^{\\prime}$. The adjusted RPN is calculated using the adjusted ratings for Occurrence ($O^{\\prime}$) and Detection ($D^{\\prime}$). The Severity rating ($S$) is considered an intrinsic property of the failure's effect and is not altered by the controls described. Therefore, the adjusted severity $S^{\\prime}$ is equal to the baseline severity $S$ for each failure mode.\n\nThe adjusted ratings are calculated based on the given control effects, with the constraint that no rating can be less than $1$.\n\n**a) Failure Mode: Incorrect cuff size selection**\nThe baseline ratings are $S_{a} = 6$, $O_{a} = 5$, and $D_{a} = 6$.\nThe adjusted ratings are calculated as follows:\n-   The severity is unchanged: $S_{a}^{\\prime} = S_{a} = 6$.\n-   The occurrence is reduced by $1$: $O_{a}^{\\prime} = O_{a} - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$.

            "problem": "A tertiary Obstetrics and Gynecology (OBGYN) clinic implements Telemedicine (TM) visits for selected prenatal care encounters. You are asked to estimate the expected patient savings per TM visit (accounting for travel-related out-of-pocket costs and the economic value of time) and extrapolate to the clinic’s annual patient savings, grounded in first principles: travel time equals distance divided by speed, round-trip distance is twice the one-way distance, and expected value is computed by averaging over a mixture of subpopulations and distributions.\n\nAssume the clinic serves $N = 2400$ prenatal patients per year. A typical prenatal schedule consists of $V = 14$ visits per patient. Of all patients, a fraction $p_{L} = 0.60$ are low-risk and $p_{H} = 0.40$ are high-risk. The clinic converts a fraction of visits to TM equal to $f_{L} = 0.25$ for low-risk and $f_{H} = 0.10$ for high-risk patients.\n\nPatients belong to one of three geographic subpopulations, assumed independent of risk category and employment status, with probabilities $q_{U} = 0.50$ (urban), $q_{S} = 0.20$ (suburban), and $q_{R} = 0.30$ (rural). Conditional on subpopulation, one-way distance $D$ (in miles) to the clinic follows a uniform distribution: urban $D \\sim \\text{Unif}[2,8]$, suburban $D \\sim \\text{Unif}[8,15]$, rural $D \\sim \\text{Unif}[15,40]$. Typical average travel speeds (in miles per hour) for the round trip are $v_{U} = 20$, $v_{S} = 30$, and $v_{R} = 45$ in the respective subpopulations.\n\nOut-of-pocket vehicle operating cost is $c_{m} = 0.20$ per mile. In-person visits incur a parking cost $P$ equal to $6$ with probability $0.70$ and $0$ otherwise; Telemedicine visits incur no parking cost. In-person waiting time $W_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is modeled as exponentially distributed with mean $20$ minutes; Telemedicine waiting time $W_{\\mathrm{tm}}$ has mean $8$ minutes. Telemedicine requires a fixed preparation time of $t_{p} = 5$ minutes. Assume these time components are independent of distance and subpopulation. The economic value of patient time (in dollars per hour) is $w = 28$ with probability $0.55$ (employed) and $w = 15$ with probability $0.45$ (non-employed), independent of subpopulation and risk category.\n\nUsing the definitions of expected value for mixed discrete-continuous models and the identities $E[D]$ for a uniform distribution and $T_{\\mathrm{travel}} = 2D/v$ for round-trip travel time, compute:\n- the expected savings per Telemedicine visit as the sum of expected travel out-of-pocket savings and expected time-cost savings, and\n- the annual patient savings by multiplying the expected savings per Telemedicine visit by the expected number of Telemedicine visits per year across the clinic population.\n\nRound your final annual savings to $4$ significant figures.

It is based on standard principles of health economics and probability theory and provides sufficient information to derive a unique solution. The solution involves calculating the expected number of telemedicine visits and the expected savings per visit, then multiplying them to find the total annual savings.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Expected Number of Telemedicine (TM) Visits per Year ($E[N_{TM}]$)\n\nThe expected number of TM visits is the sum of TM visits from low-risk and high-risk patient groups. We can calculate this using the given fractions.\n$$ E[N_{TM}] = N \\cdot V \\cdot (p_L f_L + p_H f_H) $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ E[N_{TM}] = 2400 \\cdot 14 \\cdot (0.60 \\cdot 0.25 + 0.40 \\cdot 0.10) $$\n$$ E[N_{TM}] = 33600 \\cdot (0.15 + 0.04) = 33600 \\cdot 0.19 = 6384 $$\nThe expected total number of TM visits per year is $6384$.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Expected Savings per TM Visit ($E[S]$)\n\nThe savings per visit is the cost of an in-person (IP) visit minus the cost of a TM visit. This saving comprises two components: out-of-pocket savings ($E[S_{OOP}]$) and time-cost savings ($E[S_{Time}]$).\n$$ E[S] = E[S_{OOP}] + E[S_{Time}] $$\n\n#### 2.1: Expected Out-of-Pocket Savings ($E[S_{OOP}]$)\nThis includes avoided travel costs and parking fees.\n$$ E[S_{OOP}] = E[\\text{Travel Cost}] + E[\\text{Parking Cost}] = E[2D \\cdot c_m] + E[P] = 2c_m E[D] + E[P] $$\nFirst, we find the expected one-way distance $E[D]$ using the law of total expectation over the geographic subpopulations. For a uniform distribution $\\text{Unif}[a,b]$, the mean is $(a+b)/2$.\n-   $E[D_U] = (2+8)/2 = 5$ miles\n-   $E[D_S] = (8+15)/2 = 11.5$ miles\n-   $E[D_R] = (15+40)/2 = 27.5$ miles\n$$ E[D] = q_U E[D_U] + q_S E[D_S] + q_R E[D_R] = (0.50)(5) + (0.20)(11.5) + (0.30)(27.5) = 2.5 + 2.3 + 8.25 = 13.05 \\text{ miles} $$\nThe expected parking cost is:\n$$ E[P] = (\\$6 \\times 0.70) + (\\$0 \\times 0.30) = \\$4.20 $$\nNow, we calculate the expected out-of-pocket savings:\n$$ E[S_{OOP}] = 2 \\cdot (\\$0.20/\\text{mile}) \\cdot (13.05 \\text{ miles}) + \\$4.20 = \\$5.22 + \\$4.20 = \\$9.42 $$\n\n#### 2.2: Expected Time-Cost Savings ($E[S_{Time}]$)\nThis is the economic value of the net time saved. Net time saved $\\Delta T = T_{IP} - T_{TM}$.\n$$ \\Delta T = (T_{\\text{travel}} + W_{\\text{in}}) - (t_p + W_{\\text{tm}}) $$\nThe expected time-cost savings is $E[S_{Time}] = E[\\Delta T \\cdot w] = E[\\Delta T] \\cdot E[w]$ due to independence. We must convert all time units to hours.\n-   $E[W_{\\text{in}}] = 20 \\text{ min} = 1/3$ hour\n-   $E[W_{\\text{tm}}] = 8 \\text{ min} = 2/15$ hour\n-   $t_p = 5 \\text{ min} = 1/12$ hour\nNext, we calculate the expected round-trip travel time $E[T_{\\text{travel}}]=E[2D/v]$:\n-   $E[T_{\\text{travel}}|U] = \\frac{2 E[D_U]}{v_U} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5}{20} = 0.5$ hours\n-   $E[T_{\\text{travel}}|S] = \\frac{2 E[D_S]}{v_S} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 11.5}{30} = \\frac{23}{30}$ hours\n-   $E[T_{\\text{travel}}|R] = \\frac{2 E[D_R]}{v_R} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 27.5}{45} = \\frac{55}{45} = \\frac{11}{9}$ hours\n$$ E[T_{\\text{travel}}] = q_U E[T_{\\text{travel}}|U] + q_S E[T_{\\text{travel}}|S] + q_R E[T_{\\text{travel}}|R] $$\n$$ E[T_{\\text{travel}}] = (0.50)(0.5) + (0.20)\\left(\\frac{23}{30}\\right) + (0.30)\\left(\\frac{11}{9}\\right) \\approx 0.25 + 0.15333... + 0.36666... \\approx 0.77 \\text{ hours} $$\nUsing exact fractions for precision: $E[T_{\\text{travel}}] = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{5}\\frac{23}{30} + \\frac{3}{10}\\frac{11}{9} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{23}{150} + \\frac{11}{30} = \\frac{75}{300} + \\frac{46}{300} + \\frac{110}{300} = \\frac{231}{300} = 0.77$ hours.\n\nThe expected net time saved is:\n$$ E[\\Delta T] = E[T_{\\text{travel}}] + E[W_{\\text{in}}] - t_p - E[W_{\\text{tm}}] = \\frac{231}{300} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{12} - \\frac{2}{15} $$\n$$ E[\\Delta T] = \\frac{231}{300} + \\frac{100}{300} - \\frac{25}{300} - \\frac{40}{300} = \\frac{266}{300} = \\frac{133}{150} \\text{ hours} $$\nNow we calculate the expected economic value of time $E[w]$:\n$$ E[w] = (\\$28/\\text{hr} \\times 0.55) + (\\$15/\\text{hr} \\times 0.45) = \\$15.40 + \\$6.75 = \\$22.15/\\text{hr} $$\nThe expected time-cost savings is:\n$$ E[S_{Time}] = E[\\Delta T] \\cdot E[w] = \\left(\\frac{133}{150}\\right) \\cdot \\$22.15 = \\frac{\\$2945.95}{150} \\approx \\$19.64 $$\nThe total expected savings per TM visit is:\n$$ E[S] = E[S_{OOP}] + E[S_{Time}] = \\$9.42 + \\frac{2945.95}{150} = \\frac{1413 + 2945.95}{150} = \\frac{4358.95}{150} = \\frac{87179}{3000} \\approx \\$29.06 $$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Annual Patient Savings\n\nThis is the product of the expected number of TM visits and the expected savings per visit.\n$$ \\text{Total Annual Savings} = E[N_{TM}] \\times E[S] = 6384 \\times \\frac{87179}{3000} $$\n$$ \\text{Total Annual Savings} = \\frac{556,582,336}{3000} = \\$185,527.4453... $$\nRounding to 4 significant figures, the total annual patient savings is $\\$185,500$.",
