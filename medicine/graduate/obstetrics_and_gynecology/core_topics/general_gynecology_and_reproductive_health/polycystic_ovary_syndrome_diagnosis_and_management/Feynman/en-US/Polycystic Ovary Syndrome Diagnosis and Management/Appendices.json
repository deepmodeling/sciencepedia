            "problem": "A patient with suspected Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) presents with clinical signs of androgen excess. Hirsutism is operationalized using the modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) scoring system, which sums terminal hair growth density across nine androgen-sensitive body areas, each scored on an ordinal scale from $0$ to $4$. Let the area-specific scores be $\\{3,2,2,1,1,2,1,0,0\\}$, with the total mFG score defined as $S=\\sum_{i=1}^{9} s_i$ where $s_i$ is the score for area $i$. In epidemiologically grounded practice, the presence of hirsutism is determined relative to population-specific cutoff values derived from normative distributions. Consider the following representative ethnic-specific cutoffs: $c_{\\mathrm{East\\,Asian}}=3$, $c_{\\mathrm{South\\,Asian}}=6$, and $c_{\\mathrm{Western\\,European}}=8$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of a value, $H$, which represents the number of specified populations for which a patient would be diagnosed as hirsute based on their modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) score. The procedural steps are to first calculate the total mFG score, $S$, and then to evaluate a sum of indicator functions that compare $S$ to population-specific diagnostic thresholds.\n\nThe problem provides a set of nine area-specific scores, $\\{s_i\\}_{i=1}^9$, from the mFG system. These scores are given as $\\{3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0\\}$. Each score $s_i$ is an integer on an ordinal scale from $0$ to $4$.\n\nThe total mFG score, $S$, is defined as the sum of these individual scores:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} s_i$$\nSubstituting the given values, we compute $S$:\n$$S = 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 12$$\nThus, the patient's total mFG score is $S=12$.\n\nNext, we are provided with three population-specific cutoff values for the diagnosis of hirsutism:\n1.  For an East Asian population, the cutoff is $c_{\\mathrm{East\\,Asian}} = 3$.\n2.  For a South Asian population, the cutoff is $c_{\\mathrm{South\\,Asian}} = 6$.\n3.  For a Western European population, the cutoff is $c_{\\mathrm{Western\\,European}} = 8$.\n\nThe patient is classified as hirsute if their score $S$ is greater than or equal to the relevant cutoff $c$. We are asked to compute the quantity $H$, defined as:\n$$H=\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{East\\,Asian}}\\right)+\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{South\\,Asian}}\\right)+\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{Western\\,European}}\\right)$$\nThe indicator function, $\\mathbb{I}(P)$, is defined to be $1$ if the proposition $P$ is true, and $0$ if it is false. We evaluate each term in the sum for $H$ using our calculated score $S=12$.\n\nFor the first term, we evaluate the proposition $S \\ge c_{\\mathrm{East\\,Asian}}$:\n$$12 \\ge 3$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the value of the first indicator function is:\n$$\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{East\\,Asian}}\\right) = \\mathbb{I}(12 \\ge 3) = 1$$\n\nFor the second term, we evaluate the proposition $S \\ge c_{\\mathrm{South\\,Asian}}$:\n$$12 \\ge 6$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the value of the second indicator function is:\n$$\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{South\\,Asian}}\\right) = \\mathbb{I}(12 \\ge 6) = 1$$\n\nFor the third term, we evaluate the proposition $S \\ge c_{\\mathrm{Western\\,European}}$:\n$$12 \\ge 8$$\nThis inequality is also true. Therefore, the value of the third indicator function is:\n$$\\mathbb{I}\\!\\left(S\\ge c_{\\mathrm{Western\\,European}}\\right) = \\mathbb{I}(12 \\ge 8) = 1$$\n\nFinally, we compute $H$ by summing the values of the three indicator functions:\n$$H = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$$\nThis result signifies that the patient's mFG score of $12$ meets the diagnostic criterion for hirsutism in all three of the specified populations.",

This exercise moves beyond interpreting a simple lab value to understanding the biophysical principles that determine a hormone's bioactivity, focusing on the calculation of free testosterone from total testosterone, Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG), and albumin levels. Working through the Vermeulen equation from first principles reveals why the unbound, or 'free', fraction of testosterone is the most relevant indicator of its physiological effect .",

            "problem": "A $28$-year-old patient presents with clinical features suggestive of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Laboratory values are: total testosterone $= 2.0\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$, Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG) $= 20\\,\\mathrm{nmol/L}$, and albumin $= 4.5\\,\\mathrm{g/dL}$.

Therefore, a reasoned solution can be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps as requested: (1) conversion of given quantities to molar units, (2) derivation of the governing equation for free testosterone from first principles, and (3) numerical calculation of the free testosterone concentration.\n\n**1. Conversion to Molar Units and Variable Definition**\n\nLet us define the following concentrations in molar units (mol/L):\n- $F$: concentration of free testosterone, $[T_{\\mathrm{free}}]$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$: concentration of total testosterone\n- $S$: concentration of total Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin (SHBG)\n- $A$: concentration of total albumin\n\nWe are given the following parameters, which we convert to base SI units (mol/L):\n\nTotal Testosterone ($T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$):\nGiven as $2.0\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$.

Derivation of the Equilibrium Expression**\n\nThe binding of testosterone ($T$) to SHBG ($S$) and albumin ($A$) can be described by two reversible reactions:\n$$ T + S \\rightleftharpoons TS $$\n$$ T + A \\rightleftharpoons TA $$\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the association constants are:\n$$ K_s = \\frac{[TS]}{[T_{\\mathrm{free}}][S_{\\mathrm{free}}]} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_a = \\frac{[TA]}{[T_{\\mathrm{free}}][A_{\\mathrm{free}}]} $$\nUsing our defined variable $F = [T_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, we can write the concentrations of bound testosterone as:\n$$ [TS] = K_s F [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] $$\n$$ [TA] = K_a F [A_{\\mathrm{free}}] $$\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass for total testosterone states that it is the sum of free testosterone and testosterone bound to each protein:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [T_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [TS] + [TA] = F + [TS] + [TA] $$\n\nSimilarly, the total concentration of SHBG is the sum of its free and bound forms:\n$$ S = [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] + [TS] $$\nSubstituting $[TS] = K_s F [S_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ into this equation gives:\n$$ S = [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] + K_s F [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] = [S_{\\mathrm{free}}](1 + K_s F) $$\nSolving for the free SHBG concentration, $[S_{\\mathrm{free}}]$, yields:\n$$ [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] = \\frac{S}{1 + K_s F} $$\n\nThe problem states we can assume that albumin binding is non-saturable, meaning the concentration of free albumin is approximately equal to the total albumin concentration:\n$$ [A_{\\mathrm{free}}] \\approx A $$\nThis is a valid approximation because the concentration of albumin ($A \\approx 6.8 \\times 10^{-4}$ M) is several orders of magnitude higher than that of testosterone ($T_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 6.9 \\times 10^{-9}$ M), and the affinity constant $K_a$ is relatively low.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $[TS]$ and $[TA]$ into the mass balance equation for testosterone:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = F + K_s F [S_{\\mathrm{free}}] + K_a F [A_{\\mathrm{free}}] $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $[S_{\\mathrm{free}}]$ and $[A_{\\mathrm{free}}]$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = F + K_s F \\left(\\frac{S}{1 + K_s F}\\right) + K_a F A $$\nTo solve for $F$, we first clear the denominator by multiplying the entire equation by $(1 + K_s F)$:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{tot}}(1 + K_s F) = F(1 + K_s F) + K_s F S + K_a F A (1 + K_s F) $$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$ T_{\\mathrm{tot}} + K_s T_{\\mathrm{tot}} F = F + K_s F^2 + K_s S F + K_a A F + K_s K_a A F^2 $$\nWe rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation of the form $aF^2 + bF + c = 0$:\n$$ (K_s + K_s K_a A)F^2 + (1 + K_a A + K_s S - K_s T_{\\mathrm{tot}})F - T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 0 $$\nLet us define the coefficients:\n- $a = K_s(1 + K_a A)$\n- $b = 1 + K_a A + K_s(S - T_{\\mathrm{tot}})$\n- $c = -T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nThe solution for $F$ is given by the quadratic formula:\n$$ F = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\nSince $F$ must be a physically meaningful positive concentration, and given that $a > 0$ and $c < 0$ (making $-4ac > 0$), we must choose the positive root to ensure $F > 0$. Thus, the closed-form solution is:\n$$ F = \\frac{-b + \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless intermediate terms and the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.\n$$ K_a A = (3.6 \\times 10^4 \\, \\mathrm{L/mol}) \\times (6.7669 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L}) \\approx 24.3608 $$\n$$ K_s S = (1.0 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{L/mol}) \\times (20 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L}) = 20 $$\n$$ K_s T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = (1.0 \\times 10^9 \\, \\mathrm{L/mol}) \\times (6.9343 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L}) \\approx 6.9343 $$\n\nNow, we compute the coefficients:\n$$ a = K_s(1 + K_a A) = (1.0 \\times 10^9)(1 + 24.3608) \\approx 2.5361 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{L/mol} $$\n$$ b = 1 + K_a A + K_s S - K_s T_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1 + 24.3608 + 20 - 6.9343 \\approx 38.4265 $$\n$$ c = -T_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx -6.9343 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the terms in the quadratic formula:\n$$ b^2 \\approx (38.4265)^2 \\approx 1476.60 $$\n$$ -4ac \\approx -4 \\times (2.5361 \\times 10^{10}) \\times (-6.9343 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 703.36 $$\n$$ \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \\approx \\sqrt{1476.60 + 703.36} = \\sqrt{2179.96} \\approx 46.690 $$\n\nFinally, we solve for $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{-38.4265 + 46.690}{2 \\times (2.5361 \\times 10^{10})} = \\frac{8.2635}{5.0722 \\times 10^{10}} \\approx 1.6292 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L} $$\nThe problem asks for the result in pmol/L. We convert the units:\n$$ F = (1.6292 \\times 10^{-10} \\, \\mathrm{mol/L}) \\times \\frac{10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{pmol}}{1 \\, \\mathrm{mol}} = 162.92 \\, \\mathrm{pmol/L} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $F = 163$ pmol/L.\n\nThe provided reference interval for an adult premenopausal female is $5$ to $40\\,\\mathrm{pmol/L}$. The calculated free testosterone value of $163\\,\\mathrm{pmol/L}$ is substantially above this reference interval. This biochemical result is consistent with the patient's clinical signs of hyperandrogenism and the laboratory findings of high total testosterone and low SHBG, which are characteristic features of PCOS.",
