The Pearl Index is a classic epidemiological measure used to report contraceptive failure rates from clinical studies. This exercise  will provide hands-on practice in calculating this index from raw cohort data, reinforcing the quantitative basis for comparing the typical-use effectiveness of a user-dependent method like the progestin-only pill (POP) with a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC).",

            "problem": "A multicenter pragmatic cohort study compares two progestin-only contraceptive modalities: a daily progestin-only pill (POP) and a single-rod etonogestrel subdermal implant. In the POP cohort, there were $5$ on-treatment pregnancies accrued over $3200$ woman-months of exposure. In the implant cohort, there was $1$ on-treatment pregnancy accrued over $5000$ woman-months of exposure. Use only core definitional bases and well-tested facts: the Pearl Index is defined as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per $100$ woman-years of exposure under risk, and one year consists of $12$ months. Assume exposure time is fully at risk and uniformly distributed without loss to follow-up or differential censoring, and that events are rare enough for rates to approximate underlying hazards over the aggregated intervals.\n\nStarting strictly from the definition of the Pearl Index and fundamental time conversion, derive symbolically and then compute the Pearl Index for each cohort. Then compute the ratio of the POP Pearl Index to the implant Pearl Index as a single dimensionless number. Round your final ratio to four significant figures and report only the ratio (no units).",
            "solution": "The user has requested the calculation of the Pearl Index for two contraceptive cohorts and the ratio of these indices. The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\nFor the progestin-only pill (POP) cohort:\nThe number of on-treatment pregnancies, $N_{POP} = 5$.\nThe total exposure time, $E_{POP, months} = 3200$ woman-months.\n\nFor the etonogestrel implant cohort:\nThe number of on-treatment pregnancies, $N_{imp} = 1$.\nThe total exposure time, $E_{imp, months} = 5000$ woman-months.\n\nThe Pearl Index, $PI$, is defined as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per $100$ woman-years of exposure. If $N$ is the number of pregnancies and $E_{years}$ is the exposure in woman-years, the definition is:\n$$PI = \\frac{N}{E_{years}} \\times 100$$\nThe exposure is given in woman-months. We must convert this to woman-years using the provided conversion factor: $1$ year $= 12$ months. The exposure in woman-years, $E_{years}$, is related to the exposure in woman-months, $E_{months}$, by the formula:\n$$E_{years} = \\frac{E_{months}}{12}$$\nSubstituting this conversion into the definition of the Pearl Index allows us to calculate it directly from the given exposure data:\n$$PI = \\frac{N}{\\left(\\frac{E_{months}}{12}\\right)} \\times 100 = \\frac{12 \\times N}{E_{months}} \\times 100 = \\frac{1200 \\times N}{E_{months}}$$\nThis is the operational formula we will use for the calculations.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Pearl Index for the POP cohort, $PI_{POP}$:\n$$PI_{POP} = \\frac{1200 \\times N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the POP cohort:\n$$PI_{POP} = \\frac{1200 \\times 5}{3200} = \\frac{6000}{3200} = \\frac{60}{32} = \\frac{15}{8} = 1.875$$\n\nNext, we calculate the Pearl Index for the implant cohort, $PI_{imp}$:\n$$PI_{imp} = \\frac{1200 \\times N_{imp}}{E_{imp, months}}$$\nSubstituting the values for the implant cohort:\n$$PI_{imp} = \\frac{1200 \\times 1}{5000} = \\frac{1200}{5000} = \\frac{12}{50} = \\frac{6}{25} = 0.24$$\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio, $R$, of the POP Pearl Index to the implant Pearl Index.\n$$R = \\frac{PI_{POP}}{PI_{imp}}$$\nThe symbolic expression for the ratio is:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1200 \\times N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}}}{\\frac{1200 \\times N_{imp}}{E_{imp, months}}} = \\frac{N_{POP}}{E_{POP, months}} \\times \\frac{E_{imp, months}}{N_{imp}}$$\nThis demonstrates that the ratio of Pearl Indices is equivalent to the ratio of the underlying failure rates (pregnancies per unit time), as the arbitrary scaling factor of $1200$ (arising from the convention of $100$ woman-years and $12$ months per year) cancels out.\n\nWe can compute the numerical value of the ratio using the calculated Pearl Indices:\n$$R = \\frac{1.875}{0.24}$$\nAlternatively, we can use the direct ratio of the rates:\n$$R = \\frac{5}{3200} \\times \\frac{5000}{1} = \\frac{25000}{3200} = \\frac{250}{32} = \\frac{125}{16}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal gives:\n$$R = 7.8125$$\nThe problem requires this ratio to be rounded to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure of $7.8125$ is $5$, so we round up the fourth significant figure.\n$$R \\approx 7.813$$",

This advanced practice  employs a survival analysis framework to quantify the cumulative risk of pregnancy, explicitly incorporating the impact of variable day-to-day adherence. By modeling different adherence scenarios, you will gain a clear, quantitative insight into the crucial difference between perfect-use and typical-use effectiveness and how it distinguishes progestin-only pills from long-acting methods.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with implementing a principled survival-analysis-based computation of cumulative pregnancy probability for a Progestin-Only Pill (POP) under day-to-day adherence variability, and comparing it to two Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC): the etonogestrel implant and the levonorgestrel (LNG) intrauterine device (IUD). The fundamental base is the survival function under independent daily hazards, which is a standard, well-tested model in time-to-event analysis. Specifically, if the probability of no event on day $t$ is $1 - h_t$, then the survival to day $T$ is $S(T) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} (1 - h_t)$, and the cumulative event probability by day $T$ is $1 - S(T)$.\n\nAssumptions and core definitions to use:\n- Survival and hazard: If the annual pregnancy probability under constant hazard is $p_{\\text{annual}}$, then the constant daily hazard $h$ satisfies $(1 - p_{\\text{annual}}) = (1 - h)^{365}$, hence $h = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual}})^{1/365}$. For $T$ days, the cumulative probability is $p_{0 \\to T} = 1 - (1 - h)^{T}$.\n- For the Progestin-Only Pill (POP), assume a perfect-use annual probability of pregnancy $p_{\\text{annual, perfect}}^{\\text{POP}} = 0.003$ (a decimal, not a percentage). This yields a daily base hazard $h_0 = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual, perfect}}^{\\text{POP}})^{1/365}$ under perfect use.\n- To model adherence, assume each day is independently one of four adherence categories with probabilities that sum to $1$: on-time dose, late by less than a clinically significant window, missed for approximately one day, or missed for two or more consecutive days. Let the daily category probabilities be $w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4$ respectively, with $w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 = 1$. Let the corresponding hazard multipliers be $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 4$, $m_3 = 15$, $m_4 = 50$, reflecting increasing biological risk as adherence worsens. The effective daily hazard is then $h_{\\text{eff}} = h_0 \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i m_i$. The $6$-month cumulative probability is $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} = 1 - (1 - h_{\\text{eff}})^{T}$.\n- For Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC), assume constant annual probabilities: implant $p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{implant}} = 0.001$ and levonorgestrel (LNG) intrauterine device (IUD) $p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}} = 0.002$. Their daily hazards are $h_{\\text{implant}} = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{implant}})^{1/365}$ and $h_{\\text{LNG IUD}} = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}})^{1/365}$, and their $6$-month cumulative probabilities are $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}} = 1 - (1 - h_{\\text{implant}})^{T}$ and $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}} = 1 - (1 - h_{\\text{LNG IUD}})^{T}$.\n- Use $T = 182$ days to represent $6$ months in this problem. All probabilities must be reported as decimals (unitless), not percentages.\n\nYour program should implement these formulas exactly as stated, with no further heuristic adjustments.\n\nTest suite:\nFor each test case, you are given the adherence distribution $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$ for the POP. Compute:\n- $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}}$ for that adherence distribution.\n- $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}$ (same across all test cases).\n- $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}$ (same across all test cases).\n- A boolean indicating whether $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}$.\n- A boolean indicating whether $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}$.\n\nUse the following four adherence distributions (each a tuple $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$):\n- Case A (happy path): $(0.7, 0.2, 0.08, 0.02)$.\n- Case B (boundary: all on-time): $(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)$.\n- Case C (moderate deviation): $(0.5, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1)$.\n- Case D (edge: poor adherence): $(0.3, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2)$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all four cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- For each case, output the five values in the following order: $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}}$, $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}$, $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}$, $\\left[p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}\\right]$, $\\left[p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}\\right]$.\n- Express the three probabilities as decimals rounded to six places, and the booleans as either True or False. Concatenate all four cases in order A, B, C, D, to form a single flat list. For example, the printed line should look like: \"[valA1,valA2,valA3,True,True,valB1,...]\".",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of survival analysis, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, objective in its formulation, and self-contained. The provided model, while a simplification of complex biological reality, is a mathematically sound and consistent framework for the specified task.\n\nThe solution proceeds by implementing the survival analysis model as described. The core principle is that the probability of an event (pregnancy) occurring by a certain time is calculated from the daily probability of the event *not* occurring.\n\nLet $h_t$ be the daily hazard, i.e., the probability of pregnancy on day $t$, given no pregnancy has occurred before day $t$. The probability of remaining pregnancy-free on day $t$ is $(1 - h_t)$. For a period of $T$ days, assuming the daily hazards are independent, the survival probability (remaining pregnancy-free) is the product of the daily survival probabilities:\n$$S(T) = \\prod_{t=1}^{T} (1 - h_t)$$\nThe cumulative probability of pregnancy by day $T$ is therefore $p_{0 \\to T} = 1 - S(T)$.\n\nFor a constant daily hazard $h$, this simplifies to $S(T) = (1 - h)^T$, and the cumulative probability is $p_{0 \\to T} = 1 - (1 - h)^T$.\n\nThe problem provides annual pregnancy probabilities, $p_{\\text{annual}}$, which must be converted to a constant daily hazard $h$. The relationship is derived from the survival probability over one year ($365$ days):\n$$(1 - p_{\\text{annual}}) = (1 - h)^{365}$$\nSolving for $h$ yields:\n$$h = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual}})^{1/365}$$\nThe cumulative probability over $T$ days can also be expressed directly in terms of the annual probability:\n$$p_{0 \\to T} = 1 - (1 - h)^T = 1 - \\left( (1 - p_{\\text{annual}})^{1/365} \\right)^T = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual}})^{T/365}$$\nWe will use $T=182$ days for a $6$-month period.\n\nThe calculations for each contraceptive method are as follows:\n\n**1. Long-Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARC)**\nThe etonogestrel implant and levonorgestrel (LNG) IUD have constant daily hazards. Their $6$-month cumulative pregnancy probabilities are calculated directly from their given annual probabilities.\n\nFor the implant, with $p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{implant}} = 0.001$:\n$$p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}} = 1 - (1 - 0.001)^{182/365}$$\n\nFor the LNG IUD, with $p_{\\text{annual}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}} = 0.002$:\n$$p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}} = 1 - (1 - 0.002)^{182/365}$$\nThese values are constant across all test cases.\n\n**2. Progestin-Only Pill (POP)**\nThe POP model incorporates adherence variability. First, we establish a base daily hazard, $h_0$, corresponding to perfect use, from the annual perfect-use probability $p_{\\text{annual, perfect}}^{\\text{POP}} = 0.003$:\n$$h_0 = 1 - (1 - p_{\\text{annual, perfect}}^{\\text{POP}})^{1/365} = 1 - (1 - 0.003)^{1/365}$$\n\nAdherence variability is modeled by introducing an effective daily hazard, $h_{\\text{eff}}$, which is a weighted average based on daily adherence patterns. The weights $w_i$ are the probabilities of being in one of four adherence categories, and the multipliers $m_i$ scale the base hazard according to the risk associated with each category. The provided multipliers are $m_1 = 1$ (on-time), $m_2 = 4$ (late), $m_3 = 15$ (missed ~1 day), and $m_4 = 50$ (missed 2+ days).\n\nThe effective hazard multiplier for a given adherence distribution $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$ is:\n$$M_{\\text{eff}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} w_i m_i$$\nThe effective daily hazard is then:\n$$h_{\\text{eff}} = h_0 \\cdot M_{\\text{eff}}$$\nThe $6$-month cumulative pregnancy probability for the POP for that adherence profile is:\n$$p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} = 1 - (1 - h_{\\text{eff}})^{T} = 1 - (1 - h_{\\text{eff}})^{182}$$\n\n**Calculation Steps for Each Test Case:**\nFor each given adherence distribution $(w_1, w_2, w_3, w_4)$:\n1. Calculate the constant probabilities $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}$ and $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}$.\n2. Calculate the base hazard $h_0$ for the POP.\n3. Calculate the effective hazard multiplier $M_{\\text{eff}}$ using the specific $w_i$ values for the case.\n4. Calculate the effective daily hazard $h_{\\text{eff}} = h_0 \\cdot M_{\\text{eff}}$.\n5. Calculate the POP's $6$-month cumulative probability $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}}$.\n6. Perform the boolean comparisons: is $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{implant}}$? Is $p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{POP}} > p_{0 \\to 6\\text{mo}}^{\\text{LNG IUD}}$?\n7.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution will be derived using the odds form of Bayes' theorem, which is particularly well-suited for problems involving likelihood ratios.\n\nLet $E$ be the event of an ectopic pregnancy and $I$ be the event of an intrauterine pregnancy. We are given the pretest probability, or prevalence, of ectopic pregnancy as $P(E) = 0.08$. Since ectopic and intrauterine pregnancies are the primary mutually exclusive outcomes in this context, the pretest probability of an intrauterine pregnancy is $P(I) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$.\n\nThe pretest odds of an ectopic pregnancy are the ratio of the probability of the event to the probability of its complement:\n$$ \\text{Pretest Odds}(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{P(I)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92} $$\n\nLet $T$ represent the positive finding on the transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and $H$ represent the finding of a suboptimal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) rise. We are given the likelihood ratios for these findings:\nThe likelihood ratio for the TVUS finding is:\n$$ LR_T = \\frac{P(T|E)}{P(T|I)} = 6.0 $$\nThe likelihood ratio for the hCG finding is:\n$$ LR_H = \\frac{P(H|E)}{P(H|I)} = 3.0 $$\n\nAccording to Bayes' theorem in odds form, the posttest odds are the product of the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio(s):\n$$ \\text{Posttest Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times LR $$\n\nThe problem states that the two findings, $T$ and $H$, are conditionally independent given the true pregnancy location (either $E$ or $I$). This assumption allows us to calculate the combined likelihood ratio for observing both findings, $T \\cap H$, by simply multiplying the individual likelihood ratios:\n$$ LR_{Total} = LR_{T \\cap H} = \\frac{P(T \\cap H | E)}{P(T \\cap H | I)} = \\frac{P(T|E)P(H|E)}{P(T|I)P(H|I)} = \\left(\\frac{P(T|E)}{P(T|I)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{P(H|E)}{P(H|I)}\\right) = LR_T \\times LR_H $$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ LR_{Total} = 6.0 \\times 3.0 = 18.0 $$\n\nNow we can calculate the posttest odds of an ectopic pregnancy given both findings, $\\text{Odds}(E | T \\cap H)$:\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E | T \\cap H) = \\text{Pretest Odds}(E) \\times LR_{Total} $$\n$$ \\text{Odds}(E | T \\cap H) = \\left(\\frac{0.08}{0.92}\\right) \\times 18.0 = \\frac{1.44}{0.92} $$\n\nTo simplify the fraction:\n$$ \\frac{1.44}{0.92} = \\frac{144}{92} = \\frac{36 \\times 4}{23 \\times 4} = \\frac{36}{23} $$\nSo, the posttest odds are $\\frac{36}{23}$.\n\nThe final step is to convert the posttest odds back into a probability.
