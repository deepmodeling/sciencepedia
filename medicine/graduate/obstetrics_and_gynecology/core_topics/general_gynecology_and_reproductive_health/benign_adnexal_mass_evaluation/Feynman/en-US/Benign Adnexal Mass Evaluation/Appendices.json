This practice introduces the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI), one of the first widely adopted models that combines clinical, ultrasonographic, and biochemical data into a single score.

            "problem": "A clinician is evaluating an adnexal mass using the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) framework in obstetrics and gynecology. From first principles, the index is constructed to combine independent predictors of malignancy—an ultrasound composite score, a menopausal status factor, and the Cancer Antigen $125$ (CA$125$) measurement—into a single dimensionless quantity that increases monotonically with each predictor. The ultrasound composite score is based on five binary features: multilocularity, solid areas, metastases, ascites, and bilaterality. Let $n$ be the count of features present on ultrasound. The ultrasound composite score $U$ is defined by the well-tested clinical rule: $U=0$ if $n=0$, $U=1$ if $n=1$, and $U=3$ if $n\\ge 2$. The menopausal status factor $M$ is defined as $M=1$ if the patient is premenopausal and $M=3$ if the patient is postmenopausal. The CA$125$ value is taken as the numeric laboratory measurement in International Units per milliliter (IU/mL); the RMI is treated as a dimensionless index.\n\nA $52$-year-old postmenopausal patient has an adnexal mass. Transvaginal ultrasound shows multilocularity present, solid areas present, ascites present, bilaterality absent, and no evidence of metastases, so that $n=3$. The laboratory measured CA$125$ on a diluted specimen: a $1{:}2$ dilution was performed, and the analyzer reported $93$ IU/mL for the diluted sample (the analyzer reports the measured concentration in the diluted specimen without automatic back-calculation). Using the independence and monotonicity rationale for combining predictors into the RMI, derive the mathematical expression for the RMI from these definitions and compute the patient’s RMI. Express the final RMI as a dimensionless number and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation. It is scientifically grounded in established clinical practice, specifically the Risk of Malignancy Index I (RMI I) scoring system. All provided definitions for the ultrasound score ($U$), menopausal status factor ($M$), and the patient data are clear, consistent, and do not violate scientific or mathematical principles. The problem is well-posed, requiring a logical deduction for the combination of predictors based on stated properties, and contains all necessary information to compute a unique, meaningful answer. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe central task is to derive the mathematical expression for the Risk of Malignancy Index (RMI) from first principles and then compute its value. The problem states that the RMI is a dimensionless index constructed to combine three independent predictors: the ultrasound composite score ($U$), the menopausal status factor ($M$), and the Cancer Antigen $125$ (CA$125$) level. A key property is that the RMI must increase monotonically with each predictor. The predictors $U$, $M$, and the CA$125$ level are, by definition, non-negative quantities.\n\nThe most straightforward mathematical operation to combine independent, non-negative factors such that the composite score is monotonically increasing with each factor is multiplication. Let the RMI be a function of the three variables, $RMI(U, M, \\text{CA}125)$. The condition of monotonicity requires that the partial derivatives of the RMI with respect to each variable be positive: $\\frac{\\partial \\text{RMI}}{\\partial U} > 0$, $\\frac{\\partial \\text{RMI}}{\\partial M} > 0$, and $\\frac{\\partial \\text{RMI}}{\\partial (\\text{CA}125)} > 0$. The product form $RMI = k \\cdot U \\cdot M \\cdot (\\text{CA}125)$, where $k$ is a positive constant, satisfies these requirements. Since the RMI is an index whose clinical utility is based on cut-off values, the absolute scale is a matter of convention. We can set the constant of proportionality $k$ to be $1$ without any loss of generality. This yields the standard formula for RMI I:\n$$\nRMI = U \\times M \\times \\text{CA}125\n$$\nThe problem specifies that for the RMI calculation, the CA$125$ value is taken as its numeric laboratory measurement (in IU/mL), and the resulting RMI is treated as a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNext, we determine the values of $U$, $M$, and CA$125$ for the given patient based on the provided data.\n\n1.  **Ultrasound Composite Score ($U$)**: The patient's ultrasound findings are: multilocularity present, solid areas present, ascites present, bilaterality absent, and no evidence of metastases. The number of these features present, denoted by $n$, is $3$ (multilocularity, solid areas, ascites). The rule for the ultrasound score $U$ is given as: $U=0$ if $n=0$; $U=1$ if $n=1$; and $U=3$ if $n \\ge 2$. Since $n=3$, which is greater than or equal to $2$, the patient's ultrasound score is:\n    $$\n    U = 3\n    $$\n\n2.  **Menopausal Status Factor ($M$)**: The patient is described as a $52$-year-old postmenopausal woman. The rule for the menopausal status factor $M$ is: $M=1$ for premenopausal and $M=3$ for postmenopausal. Therefore, the patient's menopausal status factor is:\n    $$\n    M = 3\n    $$\n\n3.  **Cancer Antigen $125$ (CA$125$) Value**: The laboratory measurement was performed on a diluted specimen. A $1{:}2$ dilution was performed, meaning $1$ part of the patient's serum was mixed with $1$ part of diluent, resulting in a total volume of $2$ parts. The dilution factor is the reciprocal of the concentration fraction, which is $2$. The analyzer reported a concentration of $93$ IU/mL in the diluted sample. To determine the concentration in the patient's original, undiluted serum, we must multiply the reported concentration by the dilution factor:\n    $$\n    \\text{CA}125_{\\text{actual}} = (\\text{Measured Concentration}) \\times (\\text{Dilution Factor})\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{CA}125 = 93 \\times 2 = 186\n    $$\n    The numeric value of the CA$125$ to be used in the RMI formula is $186$.\n\nFinally, we substitute these values into the derived RMI formula to compute the patient's score:\n$$\nRMI = U \\times M \\times \\text{CA}125\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 3 \\times 3 \\times 186\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 9 \\times 186\n$$\n$$\nRMI = 1674\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value of $1674$ consists of four significant figures, so no rounding is necessary.",

Even though the benign probability $p_B \\approx 0.8021$ meets the second threshold ($p_B \\geq 0.80$), the non-negligible risk of invasive cancer ($p_{\\mathrm{inv}} \\geq 0.10$) takes precedence. The potential harm of missing a cancer is far greater than the inconvenience of a specialist consultation for a benign condition. Therefore, the first rule applies, and the decision is made.\n\nThe appropriate management plan based on the calculated risk is to refer the patient to a gynecologic oncology service for further evaluation and management.\n\nThe final required output is the numerical value of $p_{\\mathrm{inv}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$p_{\\mathrm{inv}} \\approx 0.1090$$",

It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe question has two parts: the interpretation of the AUC and the quantification of the change in false positives.\n\n**Part 1: Interpretation of the AUC**\nThe Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) has a specific probabilistic meaning. It represents the probability that the model will assign a higher score to a randomly chosen positive case (malignant) than to a randomly chosen negative case (benign). An $\\text{AUC} = 0.88$ therefore means that there is an $88\\%$ probability that a randomly chosen patient with a malignant mass will have a higher model score than a randomly chosen patient with a benign mass.\n\n**Part 2: Quantification of Change in False Positives**\nLet's define the key terms and calculate the number of false positives for each threshold. A false positive (FP) is a benign case that is incorrectly classified as malignant (i.e., has a model score above the threshold).\nThe number of benign patients in the cohort is $N_{\\text{benign}} = N \\times (1-p) = 1000 \\times (1 - 0.20) = 800$.\n\nThe False Positive Rate (FPR) is defined as $1 - \\text{Specificity}$.\nThe number of false positives is given by $\\text{FP} = N_{\\text{benign}} \\times \\text{FPR}$.\n\n**At threshold $\\tau_1 = 0.30$:**\n-   Specificity is given as $\\text{Spec}_1 = 0.75$.\n-   The False Positive Rate is $\\text{FPR}_1 = 1 - \\text{Spec}_1 = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$.\n-   The number of false positives is $\\text{FP}_1 = N_{\\text{benign}} \\times \\text{FPR}_1 = 800 \\times 0.25 = 200$.\nSo, at a threshold of $\\tau_1 = 0.30$, there are $200$ benign patients who would be incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n\n**At threshold $\\tau_2 = 0.50$:**\n-   Specificity is given as $\\text{Spec}_2 = 0.90$.\n-   The False Positive Rate is $\\text{FPR}_2 = 1 - \\text{Spec}_2 = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n-   The number of false positives is $\\text{FP}_2 = N_{\\text{benign}} \\times \\text{FPR}_2 = 800 \\times 0.10 = 80$.\nSo, at a threshold of $\\tau_2 = 0.50$, there are $80$ benign patients who would be incorrectly classified as high-risk.\n\n**Summary of Change:**\nMoving the threshold from $\\tau_1 = 0.30$ to $\\tau_2 = 0.50$:\n-   The false positive rate is reduced from $0.25$ to $0.10$.\n-   The number of benign patients incorrectly triaged (false positives) decreases from $200$ to $80$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The AUC of $0.88$ means a randomly chosen malignant case has a higher model score than a randomly chosen benign case with probability $0.88$; increasing the threshold from $\\tau_{1}=0.30$ to $\\tau_{2}=0.50$ reduces the false positive rate from $0.25$ to $0.10$ and decreases the number of benign patients incorrectly triaged from $200$ to $80$ in this cohort.**\n-   The interpretation of AUC is correct.\n-   The calculation of the false positive rate reduction (from $1-0.75=0.25$ to $1-0.90=0.10$) is correct.\n-   The calculation of the decrease in the number of false positives (from $800 \\times 0.25 = 200$ to $800 \\times 0.10 = 80$) is correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. An AUC of $0.88$ implies the model correctly classifies $88\\%$ of individuals at $\\tau=0.50$; the number of benign false positives remains $200$ because prevalence drives false positives, not threshold.**\n-   The first part is a common misconception. AUC is a global measure of model performance across all thresholds, not the accuracy at a specific threshold. While accuracy at $\\tau_2$ happens to be $(\\text{TP}_2 + \\text{TN}_2)/N = (0.80 \\times 200 + 0.90 \\times 800)/1000 = (160 + 720)/1000 = 0.88$, this is a coincidence. The AUC value does not *imply* the accuracy at any single point.\n-   The second part is factually incorrect. The number of false positives is a function of both the number of benign cases (related to prevalence) and the false positive rate ($1-$specificity), which is determined by the threshold. As shown above, the number of false positives changes from $200$ to $80$ when the threshold is changed.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The AUC reflects the model’s sensitivity across all thresholds, so raising the threshold increases sensitivity; in this cohort, benign false positives decrease modestly from $200$ to $160$.**\n-   The reasoning is flawed. Raising a classification threshold makes the criterion for a positive result stricter, which generally *decreases* sensitivity, not increases it. The problem data confirms this, as sensitivity drops from $0.90$ to $0.80$.\n-   The calculation is incorrect. The number of false positives decreases from $200$ to $80$, not $160$. The number $160$ is the number of true positives at $\\tau_2$ ($\\text{TP}_2 = 0.80 \\times 200 = 160$).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. An AUC of $0.88$ proves the model has $88\\%$ specificity regardless of threshold; moving from $\\tau_{1}$ to $\\tau_{2}$ leaves the false positive rate fixed at $0.12$.**\n-   This statement fundamentally misunderstands both AUC and specificity. Specificity is dependent on the chosen threshold. The problem explicitly states that specificity changes from $0.75$ to $0.90$. The AUC value does not fix specificity.\n-   The false positive rate changes with the threshold, as it is equal to $1-\\text{specificity}$. We calculated that it moves from $0.25$ to $0.10$. It is not fixed at $0.12$. The value $0.12$ likely comes from the incorrect calculation $1 - 0.88$.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
