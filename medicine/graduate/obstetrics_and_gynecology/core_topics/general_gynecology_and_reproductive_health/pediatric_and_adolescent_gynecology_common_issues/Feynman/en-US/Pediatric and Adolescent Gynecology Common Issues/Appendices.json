            "problem": "A $12.4$-year-old girl presents for evaluation of pubertal progression and growth. Physical examination documents the following findings:\n- Breasts exhibit further enlargement of both breast and areola with no separation of their contours into a secondary mound.\n- Pubic hair is darker, coarser, and beginning to curl; it is spread over the mons pubis but does not extend to the medial thighs.\nThere is no history of menarche. You are provided stage-specific height velocity norms for breast (sexual maturity rating) stages in girls, which reflect the estrogen-mediated contribution to the growth spurt:\n- Breast stage $B2$: mean height velocity $\\mu_{B2} = 6.4$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{B2} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$.\n- Breast stage $B3$: mean height velocity $\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{B3} = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$.\n- Breast stage $B4$: mean height velocity $\\mu_{B4} = 7.3$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$, standard deviation $\\sigma_{B4} = 1.0$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$.\nUsing fundamental definitions of Tanner staging to map the examination findings to their respective stages, identify the breast and pubic hair stages. Then, based on the stage most predictive of female linear growth acceleration, select the appropriate stage-specific norm and compute the expected height velocity that is one standard deviation above the mean for that stage. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it in centimeters per year.",
            "solution": "The problem requires a three-step process: first, to determine the patient's pubertal stage using the Tanner staging system (also known as Sexual Maturity Rating or SMR) based on the provided physical examination findings; second, to identify the breast stage associated with the peak of the pubertal growth spurt using the given height velocity data; and third, to calculate the expected height velocity corresponding to one standard deviation above the mean for that specific stage.\n\n**Step 1: Determination of Tanner Stage**\n\nThe Tanner staging system classifies pubertal development into five stages, from prepubertal (Stage $1$) to adult (Stage $5$), for both breast development (B) and pubic hair growth (PH).\n\n- **Breast Staging:** The finding is \"breasts exhibit further enlargement of both breast and areola with no separation of their contours into a secondary mound.\" This description corresponds precisely to the definition of **Tanner Stage $B3$**.\n    - Stage $B1$: Prepubertal; elevation of the papilla only.\n    - Stage $B2$: Breast bud stage; elevation of breast and papilla as a small mound with enlargement of the areolar diameter.\n    - Stage $B3$: Further enlargement of the breast and areola, with no separation of their contours.\n    - Stage $B4$: Projection of the areola and papilla to form a secondary mound above the level of the breast.\n    - Stage $B5$: Mature stage; projection of the papilla only, resulting from the recession of the areola to the general contour of the breast.\n\n- **Pubic Hair Staging:** The finding is \"pubic hair is darker, coarser, and beginning to curl; it is spread over the mons pubis but does not extend to the medial thighs.\" This description corresponds to the definition of **Tanner Stage $PH3$**.\n    - Stage $PH1$: Prepubertal; no true pubic hair.\n    - Stage $PH2$: Sparse growth of long, slightly pigmented, downy hair, primarily along the labia.\n    - Stage $PH3$: Hair is darker, coarser, and more curled, spreading sparsely over the pubic symphysis.\n    - Stage $PH4$: Hair is adult in type, but the area covered is smaller than in an adult; it does not spread to the medial thighs.\n    - Stage $PH5$: Hair is adult in quantity and type, with extension to the medial thighs.\n\nTherefore, the patient's pubertal status is Tanner Stage $B3$ for breasts and $PH3$ for pubic hair.\n\n**Step 2: Identification of the Stage for Peak Growth Velocity**\n\nThe problem asks to use the stage most predictive of female linear growth acceleration, which corresponds to the peak of the pubertal growth spurt. The provided mean height velocities ($\\mu$) for each breast stage are:\n- $\\mu_{B2} = 6.4$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- $\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- $\\mu_{B4} = 7.3$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n\nComparing these values, the maximum mean height velocity occurs at breast stage $B3$ ($\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$). This stage represents the peak of the estrogen-mediated growth spurt. Clinical evaluation of growth progression in this patient should therefore be benchmarked against the norms for stage $B3$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Height Velocity**\n\nThe goal is to compute the height velocity ($v$) that is one standard deviation ($1\\sigma$) above the mean ($\\mu$) for the identified stage, $B3$. The parameters for stage $B3$ are given as:\n- Mean height velocity: $\\mu_{B3} = 8.6$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n- Standard deviation: $\\sigma_{B3} = 1.2$ $\\mathrm{cm/year}$\n\nThe height velocity one standard deviation above the mean is calculated as:\n$$v = \\mu_{B3} + 1 \\times \\sigma_{B3}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$v = 8.6 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year} + 1.2 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\n$$v = 9.8 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $9.8$ has two significant figures. To express this with three significant figures, we add a trailing zero, which is significant in this context.\n$$v = 9.80 \\, \\mathrm{cm/year}$$\nThis value represents the upper boundary of the expected typical range (within $\\pm 1$ standard deviation) for height velocity in a girl at Tanner stage $B3$.",

            "problem": "A $15.8$-year-old nulliparous adolescent presents for evaluation of acne and menstrual cycle irregularity. Menarche occurred at age $12.2$ years. Over the past $12$ months, her spontaneous menstrual cycles (no hormonal medication use in the past $12$ months) occurred with intervals of $45$, $60$, $52$, $47$, $120$, $58$, and $49$ days (reported from cycle start to cycle start). She reports moderate inflammatory acne on the face and upper back. She denies virilization signs (voice deepening, clitoromegaly). On examination, a modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) assessment yields the following regional scores: upper lip $2$, chin $2$, chest $3$, upper back $2$, lower back $1$, upper abdomen $2$, lower abdomen $3$, upper arm $2$, thigh $2$. Pelvic ultrasonography reports ovaries with multiple peripheral follicles and volume approximately $10 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$ bilaterally. Fasting morning laboratory assays by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and standardized immunoassay show total testosterone $2.1 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$, sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) $18 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$, and calculated free testosterone by equilibrium dialysis $0.045 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.

Body mass index is $26.1 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^2}$.\n\nUsing the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Androgen Excess–Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (AE-PCOS) Society consensus framework revised for adolescents, apply adolescent-specific guidance that requires both persistent ovulatory dysfunction and persistent hyperandrogenism for diagnosis, and defers the use of ovarian ultrasonography until at least $8$ years post menarche. For clinical hyperandrogenism, use hirsutism defined by a modified Ferriman–Gallwey score $\\geq 8$. For biochemical hyperandrogenism, use either a free androgen index (FAI) exceeding $8.0$ or a calculated free testosterone exceeding $0.034 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.

Compute $D$. No rounding is required. Do not use ultrasonography features in the diagnostic decision for this adolescent due to gynecologic age. The final answer must be expressed as the single number $D$ without units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the evaluation of a clinical case against a specific set of diagnostic criteria for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in an adolescent, as defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Androgen Excess–PCOS (AE-PCOS) Society consensus framework. The outcome is a binary diagnostic indicator, $D$, which is $1$ if the criteria are met and $0$ otherwise.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement. The problem provides a set of clinical and laboratory data and a formal set of rules for their interpretation. It is self-contained, scientifically grounded in established medical diagnostic guidelines, and well-posed, admitting a unique, logical solution. The language is objective and the data are internally consistent. No flaws are identified. The problem is deemed valid and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe adolescent-specific diagnostic framework requires the simultaneous presence of two key features:\n$1$. Persistent ovulatory dysfunction.\n$2$. Persistent hyperandrogenism (either clinical or biochemical).\n\nWe will evaluate each criterion systematically based on the provided data.\n\n**Criterion 1: Persistent Ovulatory Dysfunction**\n\nThe rules for diagnosing ovulatory dysfunction in adolescents are based on the patient's gynecologic age, which is the time elapsed since menarche.\nThe patient's current age is $15.8$ years and her age at menarche was $12.2$ years.\nGynecologic age = Current age - Age at menarche\n$$\n\\text{Gynecologic Age} = 15.8 - 12.2 = 3.6 \\, \\text{years}\n$$\nThe provided rules are:\na) For individuals more than $3$ years post menarche, ovulatory dysfunction is indicated by cycle intervals that are consistently less than $21$ days or greater than $35$ days.\nb) For individuals more than $1$ year post menarche, any single cycle interval greater than $90$ days is considered abnormal.\n\nThe patient is $3.6$ years post menarche, so both rules are applicable.\nThe patient's reported menstrual cycle intervals are $45$, $60$, $52$, $47$, $120$, $58$, and $49$ days.\nLet's analyze these intervals against rule (a). Every reported interval is greater than the upper limit of a normal cycle length for this gynecologic age, which is $35$ days.\n$$\n\\{45, 60, 52, 47, 120, 58, 49\\} \\subset \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x > 35 \\}\n$$\nThus, the condition of consistently having cycle intervals greater than $35$ days is met.\n\nNow, let's analyze the intervals against rule (b). The patient reported one cycle interval of $120$ days. Since $120 > 90$, this condition for abnormal ovulation is also met.\nTherefore, the criterion for persistent ovulatory dysfunction is satisfied.\n\n**Criterion 2: Persistent Hyperandrogenism**\n\nHyperandrogenism can be established clinically or biochemically. The presence of either is sufficient to meet this criterion.\n\n**2a. Clinical Hyperandrogenism (Hirsutism)**\n\nThe diagnostic rule for hirsutism is a modified Ferriman–Gallwey (mFG) score greater than or equal to $8$.\nThe patient's regional mFG scores are:\n- Upper lip: $2$\n- Chin: $2$\n- Chest: $3$\n- Upper back: $2$\n- Lower back: $1$\n- Upper abdomen: $2$\n- Lower abdomen: $3$\n- Upper arm: $2$\n- Thigh: $2$\n\nThe total mFG score is the sum of these regional scores:\n$$\n\\text{mFG Score} = 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 19\n$$\nComparing this to the threshold:\n$$\n19 \\geq 8\n$$\nThe condition is met. The patient has clinical hyperandrogenism. While acne is also a sign of hyperandrogenism, the formal criterion provided relies solely on the mFG score for hirsutism.\n\n**2b. Biochemical Hyperandrogenism**\n\nThe diagnostic rule for biochemical hyperandrogenism is a Free Androgen Index (FAI) exceeding $8.0$ or a calculated free testosterone exceeding $0.034 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n\nLet's first calculate the FAI. The standard formula is:\n$$\n\\text{FAI} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Total Testosterone}}{\\text{SHBG}} \\right) \\times 100\n$$\nGiven data:\n- Total testosterone ($T_{total}$) = $2.1 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n- Sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) = $18 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\n$$\n\\text{FAI} = \\left( \\frac{2.1}{18} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 11.67\n$$\nComparing this to the threshold:\n$$\n11.67 > 8.0\n$$\nThis condition is met.\n\nNow let's examine the second part of the biochemical rule, using the calculated free testosterone.\nGiven data:\n- Calculated free testosterone ($T_{free}$) = $0.045 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$\nThe threshold is $0.034 \\, \\mathrm{nmol/L}$.\n$$\n0.045 > 0.034\n$$\nThis condition is also met.\n\nSince at least one condition for biochemical hyperandrogenism is met (in this case, both are), the patient has biochemical hyperandrogenism.\nBecause the patient exhibits both clinical and biochemical hyperandrogenism, the overarching criterion for persistent hyperandrogenism is unequivocally satisfied.\n\n**Exclusion of Ultrasonography Data**\n\nThe problem explicitly states that ovarian ultrasonography should be deferred until at least $8$ years post menarche. As the patient is only $3.6$ years post menarche, the ultrasonography findings (ovaries with multiple peripheral follicles and volume approximately $10 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$ bilaterally) are not applicable to the diagnostic process for this individual and must be disregarded, as instructed.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe adolescent-specific NIH/AE-PCOS diagnostic criteria require the simultaneous fulfillment of two conditions:\n$1$. Persistent ovulatory dysfunction: This was confirmed.\n$2$. Persistent hyperandrogenism: This was confirmed, both clinically and biochemically.\n\nSince both mandatory criteria are satisfied, the diagnosis of PCOS is established for this adolescent according to the specified framework.\nThe diagnostic indicator $D$ is defined as $1$ if the criteria are met and $0$ otherwise.\nBased on our analysis, the criteria are met.\n$$\nD = 1\n$$",

            "problem": "A $13$-year-old nulligravid adolescent presents with heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche $8$ months ago. She reports saturating one pad every $1$ to $2$ hours for the first $3$ days of menses, with intermittent epistaxis since childhood. There is no history of easy bruising severe enough to prompt medical attention, no joint bleeding, and no exposure to anticoagulants. Family history is notable for a maternal aunt with postpartum hemorrhage. On examination, she is pale but hemodynamically stable. The Complete Blood Count (CBC) and iron studies show hemoglobin $9.0$ g/dL, mean corpuscular volume $72$ fL, platelets $310 \\times 10^{9}$/L, and ferritin $7$ ng/mL.

            "solution": "The problem presents a clinical scenario requiring a diagnosis based on provided data, followed by the selection of an appropriate therapeutic agent and the calculation of its standard dose. The process involves a systematic interpretation of the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.\n\nFirst, we must establish the diagnosis. The patient is a $13$-year-old adolescent with heavy menstrual bleeding since menarche, a history of epistaxis, and a family history of postpartum hemorrhage. This clinical triad is highly suggestive of an underlying inherited bleeding disorder. The laboratory data serve to confirm and specify this diagnosis. The Complete Blood Count (CBC) reveals a hemoglobin of $9.0$ g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of $72$ fL. The iron studies show a ferritin of $7$ ng/mL. These findings are consistent with microcytic, iron-deficiency anemia, a direct consequence of chronic, excessive blood loss. The platelet count is normal at $310 \\times 10^{9}$/L, ruling out thrombocytopenia as the primary etiology.\n\nThe coagulation studies are pivotal. The prothrombin time (PT) is normal ($12.3$ s versus a control of $12.0$ s), indicating that the extrinsic coagulation pathway, primarily dependent on Factor VII, is intact. However, the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is mildly prolonged at $41$ s (control $30$ s), pointing to a defect in the intrinsic pathway (Factors XII, XI, IX, VIII) or the common pathway.\n\nTo further delineate the cause of the prolonged aPTT and the bleeding diathesis, specific factor assays were performed. The results are:\n-   von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF:Ag): $0.35$ IU/mL (normal range typically $\\geq 0.50$ IU/mL)\n-   von Willebrand factor ristocetin cofactor activity (vWF:RCo): $0.33$ IU/mL (normal range typically $\\geq 0.50$ IU/mL)\n-   Factor VIII activity: $0.45$ IU/mL (normal range typically $\\geq 0.50$ IU/mL)\n\nThese results indicate a quantitative deficiency of von Willebrand factor (vWF). Von Willebrand factor serves two primary roles in hemostasis: it mediates platelet adhesion to the subendothelium and it acts as a carrier protein for Factor VIII, protecting it from premature degradation. The low vWF levels explain the bleeding symptoms. The concordant reduction in both vWF antigen and activity (with a vWF:RCo/vWF:Ag ratio of $0.33 / 0.35 \\approx 0.94$, which is $> 0.7$) is characteristic of Type 1 von Willebrand Disease (vWD), the most common form, which involves a quantitative deficiency of functionally normal vWF. The low Factor VIII level is a secondary consequence of the low vWF, and it is the cause of the mildly prolonged aPTT. Thus, the most likely diagnosis is Type 1 von Willebrand Disease.\n\nSecond, we select the most appropriate hemostatic agent. The patient has previously undergone a supervised desmopressin (DDAVP) trial, which demonstrated a greater than two-fold rise in vWF and Factor VIII levels. Desmopressin is a synthetic analogue of vasopressin that stimulates the release of endogenous vWF and Factor VIII from endothelial storage pools (Weibel-Palade bodies). A successful trial confirms that the patient has adequate stores and is responsive to the drug. Given this demonstrated efficacy and the noted absence of contraindications such as a history of hyponatremia or seizure disorders, desmopressin is the most appropriate hemostatic agent for the acute management of her bleeding episodes.\n\nThird, we compute the standard weight-based dose. The standard parenteral (intravenous or subcutaneous) dose of desmopressin for stimulating an increase in vWF and Factor VIII levels is $0.3$ micrograms per kilogram ($\\mu$g/kg) of body weight. The problem requires the dose to be expressed in milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg).\n\nThe conversion between micrograms and milligrams is given by $1$ mg = $1000$ $\\mu$g, or $1$ $\\mu$g = $10^{-3}$ mg.\nTherefore, we convert the dose as follows:\n$$ \\text{Dose} = 0.3 \\frac{\\mu\\text{g}}{\\text{kg}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mg}}{1000 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{g}} $$\n$$ \\text{Dose} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} $$\n$$ \\text{Dose} = 0.0003 \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} $$\nThe problem instructions specify the final answer should be in scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Dose} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-4} \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} $$\nThis is the standard weight-based dose of desmopressin for the indication.",
