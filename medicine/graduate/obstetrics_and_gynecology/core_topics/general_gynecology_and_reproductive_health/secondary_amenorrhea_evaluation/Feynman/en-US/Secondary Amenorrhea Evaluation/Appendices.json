            "problem": "A patient scenario and a quantitative framework are provided to evaluate secondary amenorrhea using decision theory and test characteristics. A nulligravid 29-year-old presents with secondary amenorrhea for $5$ months. She is sexually active, uses no contraception, and has mild acne but no galactorrhea. On physical examination, her Body Mass Index (BMI) is $27$ $\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$; there are no signs of virilization, and the pelvic examination is normal. She has no history of uterine procedures. Secondary amenorrhea is defined as the absence of menses for $\\geq 3$ months in previously regular cycles or $\\geq 6$ months in those with prior irregular cycles.\n\nAssume the following pretest probability distribution over etiologies for this patient is clinically justified by prevalence data and her presentation: pregnancy $= p_{\\text{preg}} = 0.10$, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) $= p_{\\text{PCOS}} = 0.35$, hyperprolactinemia $= p_{\\text{PRL}} = 0.15$, thyroid dysfunction $= p_{\\text{THY}} = 0.05$, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea $= p_{\\text{FHA}} = 0.20$, primary ovarian insufficiency $= p_{\\text{POI}} = 0.10$, and outflow tract obstruction (e.g., intrauterine adhesions) $= p_{\\text{OUT}} = 0.05$, with $\\sum p_i = 1.00$.\n\nYou are given test characteristics and decision costs/disutilities:\n\n- Urine Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG): sensitivity $= 0.99$, specificity $= 0.995$, unit cost $C_{\\text{hCG}} = 1$, and performing any downstream nonpregnancy-specific intervention in an undetected pregnancy has disutility $H_{\\text{miss-preg}} = 10$.\n- Serum Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH): sensitivity $= 0.99$, specificity $= 0.99$, unit cost $C_{\\text{TSH}} = 1$.\n- Serum prolactin: sensitivity $= 0.98$, specificity $= 0.98$, unit cost $C_{\\text{PRL}} = 1$. If elevated prolactin is confirmed, Pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered with cost $C_{\\text{MRI}} = 5$.\n- Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT; a progestin challenge): unit cost $C_{\\text{PWT}} = 2$. If withdrawal bleeding occurs, it provides a likelihood ratio favoring PCOS versus hypoestrogenism/outflow $LR_{\\text{bleed}} = 3$; if no withdrawal bleeding occurs, it provides a likelihood ratio favoring hypoestrogenism/outflow versus PCOS $LR_{\\text{no-bleed}} = 5$.\n- Pelvic ultrasound: sensitivity for PCOS morphology $= 0.85$, specificity $= 0.90$, unit cost $C_{\\text{US}} = 2$.\n- Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and estradiol: for primary ovarian insufficiency, sensitivity $= 0.95$, specificity $= 0.95$, unit cost $C_{\\text{FSH/E2}} = 1$.\n\nUse Bayes’ theorem and likelihood ratios, where posterior odds $= \\text{pretest odds} \\times LR$, and posterior probability $= \\dfrac{\\text{posterior odds}}{1 + \\text{posterior odds}}$. The decision rule is to choose a test sequence that minimizes expected total cost and disutility while maximizing expected diagnostic information early, given the above base rates and test characteristics. Tests may be ordered simultaneously if justified by expected value considerations.\n\nWhich of the following stepwise algorithms best satisfies these criteria for this patient?\n\nA. Start with urine hCG. If negative, obtain serum TSH and serum prolactin concurrently. If both are normal, perform a Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, evaluate for PCOS with pelvic ultrasound and androgens; if no withdrawal bleeding, obtain FSH and estradiol to assess for primary ovarian insufficiency, and evaluate for outflow obstruction if FSH and estradiol are not consistent with ovarian insufficiency. Reserve Pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for cases with confirmed hyperprolactinemia.\n\nB. Start with serum TSH. If abnormal, treat thyroid disease; if normal, obtain urine hCG. If hCG is negative, proceed directly to pelvic ultrasound. Consider serum prolactin only if ultrasound is non-diagnostic; order Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT) after ultrasound.\n\nC. Start with a Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, evaluate for PCOS with pelvic ultrasound; if no bleeding, obtain FSH and estradiol. After these, obtain urine hCG and then serum prolactin and serum TSH if prior steps are non-revealing.\n\nD. Start with urine hCG, then obtain pelvic ultrasound. Based on ultrasound findings, choose between Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT) and FSH/estradiol. Order serum TSH and serum prolactin last, only if prior steps do not yield a diagnosis.\n\nSelect the single best algorithm that is most consistent with decision-theoretic optimality under the given assumptions and test characteristics, and that adheres to the ethical constraint to avoid nonpregnancy-focused interventions in undetected pregnancy.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to identify the optimal diagnostic algorithm for a patient with secondary amenorrhea based on a decision-theoretic framework. The framework includes pretest probabilities for various etiologies, test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios), costs, and a significant disutility for performing interventions on a missed pregnancy. The decision rule is to minimize expected total cost and disutility while maximizing early diagnostic information.\n\n**Analysis of the Core Principles**\n\nThe provided data establishes a clear hierarchy of priorities for testing.\n\n1.  **Rule out Pregnancy**: The pretest probability of pregnancy is $p_{\\text{preg}} = 0.10$. A high disutility of $H_{\\text{miss-preg}} = 10$ is assigned to performing nonpregnancy-specific interventions in an undetected pregnancy. The expected disutility of proceeding with any other test or intervention without first ruling out pregnancy is at least $p_{\\text{preg}} \\times H_{\\text{miss-preg}} = 0.10 \\times 10 = 1.0$. The cost of a urine hCG test is $C_{\\text{hCG}} = 1$. This test is highly accurate ($\\text{Se} = 0.99$, $\\text{Sp} = 0.995$), and the residual expected disutility from a missed pregnancy after a negative test is extremely low: $(1-\\text{Se}) \\times p_{\\text{preg}} \\times H_{\\text{miss-preg}} = (0.01)(0.10)(10) = 0.01$. The total cost of the hCG-first strategy is $C_{\\text{hCG}} + 0.01 = 1.01$. This is clearly superior to incurring an expected disutility of $1.0$ plus the cost of another test. Therefore, the mandatory first step in any optimal algorithm is to test for pregnancy.\n\n2.  **Efficient Screening**: After ruling out pregnancy, the goal is to test for the most probable and/or easily treatable conditions using cost-effective tests. The updated (posterior) probabilities for the remaining conditions, after conditioning on a negative hCG test, are approximately: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) $\\approx 0.39$, Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA) $\\approx 0.22$, hyperprolactinemia $\\approx 0.17$, Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI) $\\approx 0.11$, thyroid dysfunction $\\approx 0.06$, and outflow tract obstruction $\\approx 0.06$. Standard, low-cost ($C=1$) blood tests are available for thyroid dysfunction (TSH), hyperprolactinemia (prolactin), and POI (FSH/E2). These tests are highly sensitive and specific.\n\nWith these principles, each option can be systematically evaluated.\n\n**Evaluation of Option A**\n\n`Start with urine hCG. If negative, obtain serum TSH and serum prolactin concurrently. If both are normal, perform a Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, evaluate for PCOS with pelvic ultrasound and androgens; if no withdrawal bleeding, obtain FSH and estradiol to assess for primary ovarian insufficiency, and evaluate for outflow obstruction if FSH and estradiol are not consistent with ovarian insufficiency. Reserve Pituitary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for cases with confirmed hyperprolactinemia.`\n\n1.  **Step 1 (hCG)**: This algorithm correctly starts with a urine hCG test, adhering to the principle of addressing the highest-risk/disutility possibility first.\n2.  **Step 2 (TSH and Prolactin)**: After a negative hCG, it proceeds to test for thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia. This is an efficient use of resources. For a combined cost of $C_{\\text{TSH}} + C_{\\text{PRL}} = 1 + 1 = 2$, it screens for two distinct, important, and treatable conditions with a combined (renormalized) probability of approximately $0.17 + 0.06 = 0.23$. The tests are highly accurate ($\\text{Se}$ & $\\text{Sp} > 0.98$). This step provides high diagnostic value for its cost.\n3.  **Step 3 (PWT)**: If TSH and prolactin are normal, the algorithm uses the PWT ($C=2$) to functionally stratify the remaining possibilities (primarily PCOS vs. hypoestrogenic states like FHA/POI). A positive test (bleeding) correctly points towards anovulation (likely PCOS), justifying further PCOS-specific workup. A negative test (no bleeding) correctly points towards hypoestrogenism or an outflow tract block. This is a logical use of a functional test to guide the next diagnostic step.\n4.  **Step 4 (Targeted Testing)**: The algorithm correctly specifies the follow-up based on the PWT result. For bleeding (suggesting PCOS), it recommends ultrasound and androgens. For no bleeding (suggesting low estrogen or outflow block), it recommends FSH/E2 measurement to differentiate POI (high FSH) from hypothalamic causes (low/normal FSH) or outflow obstruction. This is a targeted and efficient approach.\n5.  **MRI Reservation**: Reserving the expensive MRI ($C=5$) for confirmed cases of hyperprolactinemia is the standard of care and decision-theoretically optimal.\n\nThis algorithm represents a logical, cost-effective, and safe sequence that aligns with the provided quantitative data and decision criteria.\n\n**Verdict for Option A: Correct**\n\n**Evaluation of Option B**\n\n`Start with serum TSH. If abnormal, treat thyroid disease; if normal, obtain urine hCG. If hCG is negative, proceed directly to pelvic ultrasound. Consider serum prolactin only if ultrasound is non-diagnostic; order Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT) after ultrasound.`\n\nThis algorithm is fundamentally flawed because it does not start with an hCG test. It prioritizes a TSH test ($C=1$) for a condition with a relatively low probability ($p_{\\text{THY}}=0.05$) over testing for pregnancy ($p_{\\text{preg}}=0.10$), which carries a high disutility ($H_{\\text{miss-preg}}=10$) if missed. This violates the primary decision criterion. Furthermore, delaying the prolactin test until after an ultrasound is inefficient, as hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of amenorrhea that is diagnosed via a simple blood test.\n\n**Verdict for Option B: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option C**\n\n`Start with a Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT). If withdrawal bleeding occurs, evaluate for PCOS with pelvic ultrasound; if no bleeding, obtain FSH and estradiol. After these, obtain urine hCG and then serum prolactin and serum TSH if prior steps are non-revealing.`\n\nThis algorithm has a critical flaw. It starts with a PWT, which involves administering a course of progestin. Administering hormones to a potentially pregnant woman is contraindicated and represents a direct violation of the explicit constraint to \"avoid nonpregnancy-focused interventions in an undetected pregnancy.\" The $p_{\\text{preg}}=0.10$ makes this a significant risk. Like option B, it fails to prioritize the hCG test, making it an unsafe and suboptimal strategy according to the problem's own rules.\n\n**Verdict for Option C: Incorrect**\n\n**Evaluation of Option D**\n\n`Start with urine hCG, then obtain pelvic ultrasound. Based on ultrasound findings, choose between Progestin Withdrawal Test (PWT) and FSH/estradiol. Order serum TSH and serum prolactin last, only if prior steps do not yield a diagnosis.`\n\nThis algorithm correctly starts with an hCG test. However, its second step is to obtain a pelvic ultrasound ($C_{\\text{US}}=2$). While ultrasound is useful for evaluating PCOS (the most likely single diagnosis), it is less efficient as a second step than the concurrent TSH and prolactin tests proposed in Option A. The TSH/prolactin panel costs the same ($C=2$) but screens for two definitive diagnoses with highly accurate tests. Ultrasound only assesses one morphological feature of PCOS and has lower sensitivity/specificity ($\\text{Se}=0.85$, $\\text{Sp}=0.90$) compared to the endocrine tests. Most importantly, this option delays testing for thyroid disease and hyperprolactinemia until the very end. These are common, treatable causes of amenorrhea, and elevated prolactin or abnormal TSH can be the root cause of anovulation. Checking them early is essential for an efficient workup. Therefore, this sequence is less optimal than that of Option A.\n\n**Verdict for Option D: Incorrect**\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOption A provides the most robust and decision-theoretically optimal algorithm. It correctly prioritizes safety by ruling out pregnancy first. It proceeds with a cost-effective screening for common and treatable conditions (thyroid and prolactin issues). It then uses a functional test (PWT) to efficiently stratify the remaining, more complex diagnoses, leading to targeted and logical subsequent testing. This approach systematically maximizes diagnostic certainty while minimizing risk and cost, in full accordance with the problem's stated principles.",

Using the following foundational base:\n\n- In the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, gonadotropin-releasing hormone ($GnRH$) from the hypothalamus stimulates secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone ($FSH$) and luteinizing hormone ($LH$) from the pituitary, which in turn stimulate the ovary to produce estradiol ($E_2$) and inhibins. \n- Estradiol ($E_2$) and inhibin exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary to modulate $GnRH$, $FSH$, and $LH$ secretion.\n- Lesions at different levels of the axis produce characteristic compensatory and feedback responses.\n\nWhich option most accurately predicts the typical qualitative patterns of $E_2$, $FSH$, and $LH$ in POI, FHA, and PCOS?\n\nA.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone ($GnRH$) from the hypothalamus stimulates the secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone ($FSH$) and luteinizing hormone ($LH$) from the pituitary gland.\n    2.  $FSH$ and $LH$ stimulate the ovary to produce estradiol ($E_2$) and inhibins.\n    3.  $E_2$ and inhibin exert negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary to modulate $GnRH$, $FSH$, and $LH$ secretion.\n    4.

The expected outcome is a set of qualitative hormonal profiles that can be logically deduced, leading to a unique and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, clinical, and objective, free from subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Flaw Analysis**:\n    1.  **Scientific Unsoundness**: None.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Hormonal Profiles\n\nThe provided principles of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian ($HPO$) axis are applied to each condition. The core of the analysis rests on identifying the primary site of dysfunction and predicting the consequences for the rest of the axis via feedback and feedforward mechanisms.\n\n1.  **Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)**\n    - **Primary Defect**: The primary defect is at the level of the ovary. The ovaries are depleted of follicles or are resistant to gonadotropin stimulation, leading to a failure of estrogen and inhibin production. This condition is also known as hypergonadotropic hypogonadism.\n    - **Hormonal Consequences**:\n        - **Estradiol ($E_2$)**: Ovarian failure results in significantly decreased production of $E_2$. Thus, $E_2$ levels are **low**.\n        - **Feedback**: The low levels of $E_2$ and inhibin remove the negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary.\n        - **Gonadotropins ($FSH$, $LH$)**: In response to the lack of negative feedback, the pituitary gland increases its secretion of both $FSH$ and $LH$ in an attempt to stimulate the non-responsive ovaries. Inhibin specifically suppresses $FSH$, so its absence contributes to a particularly marked elevation in $FSH$. Therefore, both $FSH$ and $LH$ levels are **high**.\n    - **Predicted Pattern for POI**: $E_2$ low, $FSH$ high, $LH$ high.\n\n2.  **Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA)**\n    - **Primary Defect**: The primary defect is at the level of the hypothalamus. It is a functional suppression of pulsatile $GnRH$ secretion, often due to stressors like low body weight, excessive exercise, or psychological stress. This condition is also known as hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.\n    - **Hormonal Consequences**:\n        - **Pituitary Stimulation**: Decreased $GnRH$ secretion from the hypothalamus leads to insufficient stimulation of the pituitary gland.\n        - **Gonadotropins ($FSH$, $LH$)**: As a result of reduced pituitary stimulation, the secretion of both $FSH$ and $LH$ is decreased. Thus, $FSH$ and $LH$ levels are **low**.\n        - **Ovarian Stimulation**: The low levels of $FSH$ and $LH$ lead to a lack of stimulation of the ovaries.\n        - **Estradiol ($E_2$)**: Without gonadotropin stimulation, the ovaries do not develop follicles adequately and do not produce significant amounts of $E_2$. Therefore, $E_2$ levels are **low**.\n    - **Predicted Pattern for FHA**: $E_2$ low, $FSH$ low, $LH$ low.\n\n3.  **Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)**\n    - **Primary Defect**: PCOS is a complex endocrinopathy with multiple contributing factors, including insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism. A key feature is a disruption of the normal HPO axis function, characterized by an increased frequency of $GnRH$ pulses from the hypothalamus.\n    - **Hormonal Consequences**:\n        - **Gonadotropins ($FSH$, $LH$)**: The rapid $GnRH$ pulse frequency preferentially stimulates the secretion of $LH$ over $FSH$. This leads to **high** levels of $LH$ and **normal to low** levels of $FSH$. The resulting high $LH/FSH$ ratio (often greater than $2$ or $3$) is a classic, though not universal, feature.\n        - **Estradiol ($E_2$)**: The elevated $LH$ stimulates the ovarian theca cells to produce androgens. The relatively low $FSH$ is insufficient for complete follicular maturation and ovulation, leading to anovulatory cycles and the accumulation of small antral follicles. These follicles, along with peripheral aromatization of androgens into estrogens, produce a steady, non-cyclical level of estrogen. Therefore, $E_2$ levels are typically in the **normal to high** range for an early follicular phase, but unopposed by progesterone.\n    - **Predicted Pattern for PCOS**: $E_2$ normal to high, $FSH$ normal to low, $LH$ high.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\nBased on the derived patterns:\n- **POI**: $E_2$ low, $FSH$ high, $LH$ high\n- **FHA**: $E_2$ low, $FSH$ low, $LH$ low\n- **PCOS**: $E_2$ normal to high, $FSH$ normal to low, $LH$ high\n\nEach option is now evaluated against these derived patterns.\n\n**A.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe diagnostic evaluation of secondary amenorrhea systematically investigates potential dysfunction at four anatomical/physiological compartments: 1) the uterus/outflow tract, 2) the ovaries, 3) the anterior pituitary, and 4) the hypothalamus/central nervous system.\n\n**Initial Workup:**\nThe patient's initial workup has appropriately ruled out common causes.\n- Pregnancy, the most common cause of amenorrhea, has been excluded by monthly negative hCG tests.\n- Thyroid dysfunction is ruled out by a normal TSH level of $2.0\\,\\mathrm{mIU/L}$ (typical reference range $\\approx 0.4 - 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mIU/L}$).\n- Hyperprolactinemia is ruled out by a normal prolactin level of $10\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$ (typical reference range for a non-pregnant, non-lactating female is $< 25\\,\\mathrm{ng/mL}$).\n- The patient's normal BMI of $23\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^2}$ and absence of signs of hyperandrogenism (hirsutism, acne) make diagnoses like functional hypothalamic amenorrhea due to low body weight or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) less likely, although not entirely excluded at this stage.\n\n**Progestin Challenge Test:**\nThis test assesses the presence of two factors: adequate endogenous estrogen and a patent outflow tract. Estrogen is required to proliferate the endometrium (the \"primer\"), and a patent outflow tract is necessary for menses to occur. The withdrawal of a progestational agent from an estrogen-primed endometrium should induce bleeding.\n- **Patient's Result:** No withdrawal bleeding.\n- **Interpretation:** This negative result indicates either (i) insufficient endogenous estrogen to have proliferated the endometrium (a defect in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis) or (ii) a problem with the uterus or outflow tract (e.g., adhesions, scarring, cervical stenosis) that prevents bleeding even if the endometrium were appropriately stimulated.\n\n**Combined Estrogen–Progestin Challenge Test:**\nThis test is the next logical step to differentiate between the two possibilities from the negative progestin challenge. Exogenous estrogen is provided to prime and proliferate the endometrium, followed by a progestin to induce secretory changes. Subsequent withdrawal should cause bleeding if the uterus and outflow tract are functional.\n- **Patient's Result:** No withdrawal bleeding.\n- **Interpretation:** The failure to bleed after being given an adequate course of both exogenous estrogen and progestin is pathognomonic for a defect at the level of the uterus or outflow tract. The end organ (the endometrium or cervix) is either unable to respond to hormonal stimulation or is physically obstructed. This strongly suggests a \"Compartment I\" disorder. The patient's history of postpartum hemorrhage followed by uterine curettage is a classic risk factor for the development of intrauterine adhesions (Asherman's syndrome), which destroy the responsive basal layer of the endometrium and/or physically obliterate the uterine cavity. Cervical stenosis is another, less common, possibility resulting from uterine instrumentation.\n\n**Conclusion from First Principles:**\nBased on the failure of the combined estrogen–progestin challenge, the dysfunction is localized to the uterus or cervix. The most direct and definitive next step is to visualize the uterine cavity.\n\n## OPTION-BY-OPTION ANALYSIS\n\n**A. Order Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the sella turcica to evaluate for a pituitary adenoma**\nThis step is used to investigate pituitary or hypothalamic causes of amenorrhea. This patient's normal prolactin level, lack of neurological symptoms, and, most importantly, her failure to bleed on a combined hormonal challenge make a central cause exceedingly unlikely. The problem has been localized to the uterus, not the pituitary gland. Therefore, this test is inappropriate.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Begin pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) therapy to restore ovulation**\nPulsatile GnRH is a treatment for amenorrhea of hypothalamic origin (e.g., Kallmann syndrome, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea). It is not a diagnostic test. Furthermore, the diagnostic workup has pointedly demonstrated that the problem is not hypothalamic, but uterine. Inducing ovulation would be futile if the endometrium is non-functional or the outflow tract is blocked.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Measure anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) to assess ovarian reserve**\nMeasuring AMH is appropriate when evaluating for primary ovarian insufficiency (premature ovarian failure). While this condition causes hypoestrogenism (and thus a negative progestin challenge), a patient with ovarian failure would still have a functional uterus. Therefore, she should experience withdrawal bleeding after a combined estrogen-progestin challenge. The patient's failure to do so rules against ovarian failure as the primary cause of her presenting amenorrhea and makes this test diagnostically irrelevant as the *next* step.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Perform diagnostic hysteroscopy with intent to treat suspected intrauterine adhesions or evaluate cervical stenosis**\nThis is the gold-standard procedure for diagnosing and treating intrauterine pathology. Given the patient's history (uterine curettage) and the definitive result of the hormonal challenges (no bleeding after combined estrogen-progestin), Asherman's syndrome is the leading diagnosis. Hysteroscopy allows for direct visualization of the uterine cavity to confirm adhesions and simultaneous treatment via adhesiolysis. It also allows for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical stenosis. This is the most logical and direct next step.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Repeat the combined estrogen–progestin challenge using a higher estrogen dose and a longer course**\nThe regimen used (conjugated estrogens $1.25\\,\\mathrm{mg}$ for $21$ days) is a standard and adequate protocol to stimulate endometrial proliferation. A negative result from this test is considered definitive. Repeating the test with a higher dose or longer duration is not standard practice, would delay diagnosis, and is highly unlikely to change the outcome or the management plan. The current data is sufficient to proceed with uterine evaluation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
