For each oocyte, the following stage-wise probabilities apply and are independent across oocytes and stages: fertilization probability $0.70$ per retrieved MII oocyte, blastulation probability $0.50$ conditional on fertilization, and implantation probability $0.40$ per blastocyst conditional on it being transferred. Assume that across the cohort, every blastocyst that forms is transferred in a single-blastocyst transfer, implantation results in a singleton live birth without pregnancy loss, and there is no multiple gestation.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions from probability theory (chains of conditional events and linearity of expectation), derive the expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte across the cohort. Round your final answer to three significant figures and express it as births per retrieved MII oocyte.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of live births per retrieved metaphase II (MII) oocyte. This can be solved by first determining the probability that a single retrieved MII oocyte results in a live birth, and then invoking the principle of linearity of expectation.\n\nLet's define a set of events for a single retrieved MII oocyte's progression:\n- $F$: The oocyte is successfully fertilized.\n- $B$: The fertilized oocyte develops into a blastocyst.\n- $T$: The resulting blastocyst is transferred.\n- $I$: The transferred blastocyst implants.\n- $L$: The implantation leads to a live birth.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following stage-wise conditional probabilities:\n- The probability of fertilization per retrieved MII oocyte is $P(F) = 0.70$.\n- The probability of blastulation conditional on fertilization is $P(B|F) = 0.50$.\n- The probability of implantation per transferred blastocyst is $P(I|T) = 0.40$.\n\nThe problem also includes several simplifying assumptions which translate into conditional probabilities:\n- \"every blastocyst that forms is transferred\" implies that the probability of transfer, given that a blastocyst has formed, is $1$. Therefore, $P(T|B) = 1.0$.\n- \"implantation results in a singleton live birth without pregnancy loss\" implies that the probability of a live birth, given that implantation has occurred, is $1$. Therefore, $P(L|I) = 1.0$.\n\nWe are asked for the expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte. Let's consider a large cohort of $n$ retrieved oocytes. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th oocyte (where $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$), such that:\n$$\nX_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th oocyte results in a live birth} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of live births, $N_L$, from the cohort of $n$ oocytes is the sum of these indicator variables: $N_L = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$.\n\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected total number of live births is:\n$$E[N_L] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nFor an indicator variable, the expectation is equal to the probability of the event it indicates. Thus, $E[X_i] = P(X_i=1)$. Since each oocyte is subject to the same independent probabilities, $P(X_i=1)$ is the same for all $i$. Let this probability be $p_L$, which is the probability of a single oocyte resulting in a live birth, $P(L)$.\nTherefore, $E[X_i] = p_L$ for all $i$, and the expected total number of live births is $E[N_L] = n \\cdot p_L$.\n\nThe expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte is this total expectation divided by the number of oocytes, $n$:\n$$\\frac{E[N_L]}{n} = \\frac{n \\cdot p_L}{n} = p_L$$\nThus, our task reduces to calculating $p_L = P(L)$, the probability that a single retrieved oocyte gives rise to a live birth.\n\nA live birth can only occur if all preceding stages are successful. This forms a chain of conditional events. The probability of a live birth, $P(L)$, is the probability of the intersection of all the necessary events: $P(F \\cap B \\cap T \\cap I \\cap L)$. We can calculate this using the chain rule of probability:\n$$P(L) = P(F) \\cdot P(B|F) \\cdot P(T|F \\cap B) \\cdot P(I|F \\cap B \\cap T) \\cdot P(L|F \\cap B \\cap T \\cap I)$$\nThe biological process described is sequential, meaning the outcome of any given stage depends only on the successful completion of the prior stage. This allows us to simplify the conditional probabilities:\n- The transfer of an embryo depends only on it becoming a blastocyst, so $P(T|F \\cap B) = P(T|B)$.\n- Implantation depends only on the embryo being transferred, so $P(I|F \\cap B \\cap T) = P(I|T)$.\n- A live birth depends only on implantation, so $P(L|F \\cap B \\cap T \\cap I) = P(L|I)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the chain rule expression yields:\n$$P(L) = P(F) \\cdot P(B|F) \\cdot P(T|B) \\cdot P(I|T) \\cdot P(L|I)$$\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values:\n$$P(L) = (0.70) \\cdot (0.50) \\cdot (1.0) \\cdot (0.40) \\cdot (1.0)$$\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$P(L) = 0.70 \\times 0.50 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P(L) = 0.35 \\times 0.40$$\n$$P(L) = 0.14$$\nThe expected number of live births per retrieved MII oocyte is $0.14$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. To express $0.14$ with three significant figures, we write it as $0.140$.",

            "problem": "A cohort of $10$ metaphase II (MII) oocytes is inseminated in a conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure. Assume that each oocyte has an independent probability $p = 0.4$ of fertilizing through IVF and that all oocytes are biologically comparable. For those oocytes that do not fertilize through IVF, a rescue intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is considered at a fixed decision time. Empirically, oocyte competence for fertilization after delayed manipulation is observed to decline with postovulatory aging; model the probability that a rescue ICSI performed at time $t$ hours after insemination will result in normal fertilization as an exponential function $q(t) = q_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda t)$, where $q_{0} = 0.65$ is the baseline probability at $t = 0$ and $\\lambda = 0.05\\,\\text{hour}^{-1}$ is the decay rate.

Your discussion should be qualitative; only the expected value computed above will be graded numerically.",
            "solution": "Let $N = 10$ be the total number of oocytes. Each oocyte represents an independent trial. Let us consider the outcome for a single oocyte.\nThe probability that an oocyte fertilizes through conventional IVF is given as $p = 0.4$.\nThe probability that an oocyte does not fertilize through conventional IVF is therefore $1 - p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.\n\nAccording to the policy, oocytes that do not show evidence of fertilization at time $t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$ undergo rescue ICSI.\nThe probability of a successful fertilization via rescue ICSI performed at time $t$ is given by the function $q(t) = q_{0}\\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\nWe are given $q_{0} = 0.65$ and $\\lambda = 0.05\\,\\text{hour}^{-1}$.\nThe rescue ICSI is performed at $t = t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$. So, the probability of success for a rescue ICSI procedure at this specific time is:\n$$q(t_{\\mathrm{w}}) = q(18) = 0.65 \\exp(-0.05 \\times 18) = 0.65 \\exp(-0.9)$$\n\nFor a single oocyte to be successfully fertilized by rescue ICSI, two sequential, independent events must occur:\n1.  The oocyte must fail to fertilize by conventional IVF. The probability of this event is $(1 - p)$.\n2.  The subsequent rescue ICSI procedure on this oocyte must be successful. The probability of this event is $q(t_{\\mathrm{w}})$.\n\nThe probability, let us call it $p_{\\text{rescue}}$, that a single, randomly chosen oocyte from the cohort is successfully fertilized via rescue ICSI is the product of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$p_{\\text{rescue}} = (1 - p) \\times q(t_{\\mathrm{w}})$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$p_{\\text{rescue}} = (1 - 0.4) \\times 0.65 \\exp(-0.9) = 0.6 \\times 0.65 \\exp(-0.9) = 0.39 \\exp(-0.9)$$\n\nWe need to find the expected number of oocytes that will be successfully fertilized by rescue ICSI from the total cohort of $N=10$ oocytes. Let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable for the $i$-th oocyte, where $X_i=1$ if the $i$-th oocyte is successfully fertilized by rescue ICSI, and $X_i=0$ otherwise.\nThe probability that $X_i=1$ is $p_{\\text{rescue}}$.\nThe expected value of this indicator variable is $E[X_i] = 1 \\cdot P(X_i=1) + 0 \\cdot P(X_i=0) = p_{\\text{rescue}}$.\n\nLet $E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}}$ be the total expected number of successfully rescued oocytes in the cohort. By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of the sum of these random variables is the sum of their individual expected values:\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nSince all oocytes are biologically comparable and the trials are independent, $E[X_i]$ is the same for all $i$. Therefore:\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = N \\times E[X_1] = N \\times p_{\\text{rescue}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions and values:\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = N (1-p) q_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t_{\\mathrm{w}})$$\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = 10 \\times (1 - 0.4) \\times 0.65 \\times \\exp(-0.05 \\times 18)$$\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = 10 \\times 0.6 \\times 0.65 \\times \\exp(-0.9)$$\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} = 3.9 \\exp(-0.9)$$\nTo find the numerical value, we compute $\\exp(-0.9) \\approx 0.4065696597$.\n$$E_{\\text{total\\_rescue}} \\approx 3.9 \\times 0.4065696597 \\approx 1.5856216729$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, we get $1.586$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative discussion, the laboratory policy of waiting until $t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$ represents a critical trade-off between diagnostic certainty and biological potential.\n\nThe primary advantage of waiting for $t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$ is the high accuracy in identifying fertilization failure. The definitive sign of normal fertilization is the presence of two pronuclei (2PN), which typically becomes visible between $16$ and $18$ hours post-insemination. This waiting period minimizes the misclassification risk, specifically the risk of a \"false positive\" for fertilization failure. Intervening too early, before the 2PN stage is expected, could lead to performing ICSI on an oocyte that was developing normally but at a slower pace. Such an action would be iatrogenic, destroying a potentially viable embryo. Thus, waiting until $t_{\\mathrm{w}}$ ensures that rescue ICSI is applied almost exclusively to the true non-fertilized population.\n\nThe principal disadvantage is the time-dependent decline in oocyte competence, which is explicitly modeled by the function $q(t)=q_0 \\exp(-\\lambda t)$. Postovulatory aging leads to the degradation of cytoplasmic factors essential for fertilization and early embryogenesis. By delaying rescue ICSI until $t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$, the probability of success, $q(t_{\\mathrm{w}})$, is substantially reduced from its theoretical maximum, $q_0$. In this problem, the success probability drops from $q_0 = 0.65$ to $q(18) \\approx 0.264$, more than halving the potential success rate of the rescue procedure itself. This decline impacts not only the chance of fertilization but also the downstream viability of any resulting embryo, as the cellular damage from aging can increase the risk of aneuploidy and poor development.\n\nConsequently, the choice of $t_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is a balance. An earlier intervention time (smaller $t_{\\mathrm{w}}$) would increase $q(t)$ and potentially yield more total fertilized oocytes, but at the cost of higher misclassification risk and potential harm to normally fertilizing oocytes. A later intervention time (larger $t_{\\mathrm{w}}$) improves diagnostic precision, ensuring better utilization of the rescue technique on the correct targets, but it intrinsically lowers the expected success count due to oocyte aging. The clinic's policy of $t_{\\mathrm{w}} = 18\\,\\text{hours}$ prioritizes preventing harm to viable embryos (diagnostic safety) over maximizing the numerical yield from the rescue procedure (procedural efficacy).",

To evaluate how likely this call reflects a true whole-embryo trisomy $16$ rather than a mosaic or euploid embryo, model the test process using the following scientifically grounded assumptions.\n\nStart from Bayes' theorem and a binomial sampling model for mosaicism. In the laboratory cohort from which this blastocyst comes, let the prevalence of whole-embryo trisomy $16$ be $p_{w} = 0.03$, the prevalence of mosaic trisomy $16$ be $p_{m} = 0.05$, and the prevalence of euploid embryos be $p_{e} = 1 - p_{w} - p_{m}$.

The transfer of a mosaic embryo is typically considered only when no euploid embryos are available for transfer.\n2.  **Specific Chromosome and Prognosis:** Trisomy $16$ is the most common trisomy found in first-trimester miscarriages and is generally considered uniformly lethal. A non-mosaic trisomy $16$ embryo would not be viable. The potential of a mosaic embryo is uncertain, but the prognosis is poor. Live births with trisomy $16$ mosaicism are exceptionally rare and are often associated with severe intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), congenital anomalies, and poor postnatal outcomes. The finding could also represent confined placental mosaicism, which does not affect the fetus directly but can still lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preeclampsia, IUGR, and stillbirth.\n3.  **Genetic Counseling:** Comprehensive genetic counseling is mandatory before considering the transfer of such an embryo. The counseling must cover the high risk of implantation failure, miscarriage, the uncertain and generally poor prognosis if a pregnancy were to be established, and the potential for severe pregnancy complications. The decision to transfer must be a shared one between the clinicians and the fully informed patients.\n4.  **Prenatal Diagnostic Follow-up:** If the embryo is transferred and results in a clinical pregnancy, invasive prenatal diagnostic testing (not screening) is strongly recommended to ascertain the fetal karyotype. This would involve either chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or, more definitively, amniocentesis. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is a screening test and is not sufficient in this high-risk context.\n\nIn summary, an embryo with mosaic trisomy $16$ at any level has a very low priority for transfer due to the lethality associated with this specific aneuploidy.",
