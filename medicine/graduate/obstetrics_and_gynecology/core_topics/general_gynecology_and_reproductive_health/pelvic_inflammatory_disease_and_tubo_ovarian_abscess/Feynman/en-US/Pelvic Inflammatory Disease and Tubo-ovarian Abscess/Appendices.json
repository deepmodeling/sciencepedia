            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Patient Profile:** A $27$-year-old nulliparous woman.\n- **Clinical Presentation:** $48$ hours of lower abdominal and pelvic pain, fever of $39.2^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, and purulent vaginal discharge.\n- **Physical Examination:** Marked cervical motion tenderness.\n- **Laboratory Data:**\n  - White Blood Cells (WBC): $16{,}500/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$ with left shift.\n  - C-Reactive Protein (CRP): $120\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$.\n  - Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR): $55\\ \\mathrm{mm/hr}$.\n  - Urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG): negative.\n- **Transvaginal Ultrasonography (TVUS) Data:**\n  - Right adnexal complex mass measuring $6.8\\times 5.6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n  - Thick septations up to $4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n  - Internal low-level echoes with fluid-debris levels.\n  - Peripheral color Doppler hyperemia.\n  - No discernible internal vascular flow.\n  - Moderate complex pelvic free fluid.\n  - Adjacent pelvic fat appears echogenic.\n- **Computed Tomography (CT) Data:**\n  - Rim enhancement of the mass.\n  - Stranding of adjacent fat.\n  - Punctate gas locules within the lesion.\n- **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) Data:**\n  - Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) shows marked diffusion restriction within the cavity.\n  - Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) of $0.60\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n  - No classic T$2$ “shading” pattern.\n- **Task:** Classify the adnexal lesion as either Tubo-Ovarian Abscess (TOA) or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst based on first principles.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem provides a detailed clinical vignette with history, physical exam, laboratory, and multi-modality imaging findings.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The described clinical scenario, laboratory values, and imaging characteristics are classic and well-documented representations of pelvic inflammatory disease complicated by a tubo-ovarian abscess. The use of DWI/ADC physics for tissue characterization is a standard, scientifically-validated technique in radiology. All data are consistent with established medical science.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient, consistent data to allow for a differential diagnosis and a definitive conclusion through logical deduction. The question is specific and answerable.\n- **Objective:** The data are presented using objective, quantitative (e.g., lab values, measurements) and standard qualitative medical descriptors (e.g., \"purulent,\" \"rim enhancement\"). There is no subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective clinical problem that can be solved by applying fundamental principles of pathophysiology and medical imaging.\n\n### Derivation\nThe task is to differentiate between a Tubo-Ovarian Abscess (TOA) and a hemorrhagic ovarian cyst. We will analyze the evidence from first principles.\n\n1.  **Clinical and Laboratory Evidence of Infection:**\n    The patient presents with a triad of acute lower abdominal pain, high fever ($39.2^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$), and purulent vaginal discharge. Physical examination reveals marked cervical motion tenderness. This clinical constellation is the hallmark of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), an infection of the upper female genital tract. Laboratory findings corroborate a significant systemic inflammatory response to infection:\n    - Marked leukocytosis ($16{,}500/\\mu\\mathrm{L}$) with a left shift indicates an acute bacterial infection.\n    - Highly elevated inflammatory markers (CRP $120\\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, ESR $55\\ \\mathrm{mm/hr}$) further support a severe inflammatory process.\n    A hemorrhagic cyst typically causes pain due to stretching of the ovarian capsule or rupture with hemoperitoneum, but it does not intrinsically cause high fever, purulent discharge, or the profound systemic inflammatory response seen here.\n\n2.  **Exclusion of Pregnancy-Related Pathology:**\n    The negative urine hCG result is a critical datum. It reliably excludes pathologies related to pregnancy, such as a ruptured ectopic pregnancy or a hemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst of pregnancy.\n\n3.  **Multi-Modality Imaging Analysis:**\n    The imaging findings across three modalities (US, CT, MRI) provide a cohesive and definitive picture.\n\n    - **Ultrasound:** A TOA is classically a complex, multiloculated adnexal mass, often with thick walls and septa ($>3\\ \\mathrm{mm}$), filled with complex fluid containing low-level echoes or fluid-debris levels. The findings of a $6.8\\times 5.6\\ \\mathrm{cm}$ mass with thick ($4\\ \\mathrm{mm}$) septations and fluid-debris levels are characteristic. The peripheral hyperemia on Doppler represents the intense inflammatory vascularity in the abscess wall. The absence of internal flow is expected, as the abscess cavity contains avascular pus. The surrounding findings of echogenic fat and complex free fluid indicate associated pelvic peritonitis, a common extension of the infectious process. While a hemorrhagic cyst can be complex, it more typically shows a reticular pattern of fibrin strands, has thinner walls, and does not usually elicit such a profound surrounding inflammatory reaction.\n\n    - **CT:** The CT findings are highly specific for an abscess. Rim enhancement of the wall is the classic sign of an encapsulated fluid collection with a hypervascular inflammatory capsule. Fat stranding is the CT correlate of the inflammatory changes in the pelvic fat seen on ultrasound. The most specific finding is the presence of **punctate gas locules**. Gas within a non-gastrointestinal collection is virtually pathognomonic for an infection with gas-forming organisms (typically anaerobes). It is impossible for a sterile hemorrhagic cyst to contain gas.\n\n    - **MRI and Diffusion Physics:** The MRI findings provide the final, conclusive piece of evidence based on physical principles.\n        - **Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI)** measures the random, thermally-driven motion (Brownian motion) of water molecules. The signal intensity on DWI is inversely related to the degree of water motion.\n        - **Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC)** provides a quantitative map of the magnitude of diffusion.\n        - The substance within an abscess is pus, a highly viscous fluid composed of a dense matrix of living and dead neutrophils, bacteria, necrotic tissue, and proteinaceous exudate. This dense, cellular environment severely restricts the random motion of water molecules.\n        - Consequently, an abscess cavity demonstrates markedly restricted diffusion, which manifests as high signal on DWI and a very low ADC value. The measured ADC of $0.60\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ is extremely low and is a signature finding for pus. In contrast, the fluid in a hemorrhagic cyst consists of blood products and serum. While diffusion may be slightly restricted compared to simple fluid (which has an ADC near $3.0\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$), it is significantly less restricted than in pus; the ADC for subacute hemorrhage is typically in the range of $1.0-1.6\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$. The measured value of $0.60\\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{mm}^2/\\mathrm{s}$ is incompatible with a hemorrhagic cyst.\n        - The absence of T$2$ \"shading\" argues against an endometrioma or a chronic hemorrhagic process, where iron deposition (hemosiderin) would cause a drop in T$2$ signal.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overwhelming evidence from the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and characteristic multi-modality imaging findings (especially gas on CT and profoundly restricted diffusion on MRI) definitively identifies the lesion as a Tubo-Ovarian Abscess.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Tubo-ovarian abscess requiring broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, with image-guided drainage if there is lack of clinical improvement**\nThis option correctly identifies the lesion as a tubo-ovarian abscess based on the synthesis of all provided data. The proposed management is the standard of care for a hemodynamically stable patient with a large TOA and systemic signs of infection. Initial management involves hospitalization for intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics. For a large abscess (this one is nearly $7\\ \\mathrm{cm}$) or in cases of non-response to antibiotics within $48-72$ hours, image-guided drainage is the indicated next step to achieve source control. This option is entirely consistent with the derived diagnosis and established clinical guidelines.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst managed conservatively with analgesia and repeat imaging in $6$–$8$ weeks**\nThis diagnosis is definitively contradicted by the clinical signs of severe infection (fever, purulent discharge), the laboratory evidence of a robust inflammatory response, and particularly by the pathognomonic imaging findings of gas within the lesion (CT) and a very low ADC value (MRI). Managing a TOA with only analgesia would be a critical medical error leading to progression of sepsis and potential rupture.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Ovarian torsion requiring urgent laparoscopic detorsion**\nThis diagnosis is inconsistent with the findings. The clinical picture of high fever and purulent discharge is not typical for torsion. Most importantly, the Doppler ultrasound finding of *peripheral hyperemia* (increased flow) is the opposite of the expected finding in torsion, which is absent or decreased stromal blood flow.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Ruptured ectopic pregnancy requiring emergent surgical management**\nThis diagnosis is definitively ruled out by the negative urine hCG test. An ectopic pregnancy cannot exist in the absence of hCG production.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).\nLet $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have PID.\nLet $T$ be the event that the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) is positive.\nLet $T^c$ be the event that the NAAT is negative.\n\nThe given information can be formally expressed in the language of probability theory:\n1.  The pretest probability of PID is given as $P(D) = 0.35$.\n2.  The probability of not having PID is the complement, so $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65$.\n3.  The sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is present: $P(T|D) = 0.62$.\n4.  The specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test result given that the disease is absent: $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.92$.\n\nFrom the definition of specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test result given that the disease is absent (the false positive rate). This is the complement of specificity:\n$$P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.92 = 0.08$$\n\nThe objective is to find the post-test probability of PID given a positive NAAT. This is the conditional probability $P(D|T)$.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental definition of conditional probability:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)}$$\nwhere $P(D \\cap T)$ is the joint probability of having the disease and testing positive, and $P(T)$ is the total probability of testing positive.\n\nFirst, we express the numerator, $P(D \\cap T)$, using the definition of conditional probability, which can be rearranged as $P(A \\cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$. Thus:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = P(T|D) P(D)$$\nThis term represents the true positives. Substituting the given values:\n$$P(D \\cap T) = 0.62 \\times 0.35 = 0.217$$\n\nNext, we express the denominator, $P(T)$, using the law of total probability. A positive test result can occur in two mutually exclusive ways:\n1.  The patient has the disease and tests positive ($D \\cap T$).\n2.  The patient does not have the disease and tests positive ($D^c \\cap T$).\n\nThe total probability $P(T)$ is the sum of the probabilities of these two events:\n$$P(T) = P(D \\cap T) + P(D^c \\cap T)$$\nWe have already calculated the first term. The second term, $P(D^c \\cap T)$, which represents the false positives, can be similarly expanded:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T) = P(T|D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(D^c \\cap T) = 0.08 \\times 0.65 = 0.052$$\nNow, we can calculate the total probability of a positive test:\n$$P(T) = 0.217 + 0.052 = 0.269$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the calculated values for the numerator and the denominator back into the expression for $P(D|T)$:\n$$P(D|T) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T)}{P(T)} = \\frac{0.217}{0.269}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.8066914498...$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P(D|T) \\approx 0.8067$$\nThis represents the post-test probability of the patient having PID given her positive test result.",
