The assay's sensitivity is $0.99$ and specificity is $0.995$. Using only first principles—definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and Bayes' theorem—derive expressions for the positive predictive value and negative predictive value in terms of $p$, sensitivity, and specificity, and then evaluate these using the provided values.

Express the positive predictive value and negative predictive value as decimals, rounded to four significant figures, with no percentage signs.",
            "solution": "### Derivation and Calculation\nWe begin by defining the events:\n-   $D$: The event that a patient has the disease (is truly HIV-positive).\n-   $D^c$: The event that a patient does not have the disease (is truly HIV-negative).\n-   $T^+$: The event that the assay result is positive (reactive).\n-   $T^-$: The event that the assay result is negative (non-reactive).\n\nThe givens can be expressed as conditional probabilities:\n-   Prevalence: $P(D) = p = 0.01$. Thus, $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 0.99$.\n-   Sensitivity: $S_e = P(T^+|D) = 0.99$.\n-   Specificity: $S_p = P(T^-|D^c) = 0.995$.\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of incorrect test results:\n-   False positive rate: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - S_p = 1 - 0.995 = 0.005$.\n-   False negative rate: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - S_e = 1 - 0.99 = 0.01$.\n\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\nThe Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is the posterior probability that a patient has the disease given a positive test result, $P(D|T^+)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = S_e \\cdot p + (1-S_p)(1-p)$$\nThe expression for $PPV$ is:\n$$PPV = \\frac{S_e \\cdot p}{S_e \\cdot p + (1-S_p)(1-p)}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$PPV = \\frac{(0.99)(0.01)}{(0.99)(0.01) + (1-0.995)(1-0.01)} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.0099 + (0.005)(0.99)} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.0099 + 0.00495} = \\frac{0.0099}{0.01485}$$\n$$PPV = 0.66666... \\approx 0.6667$$\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\nThe Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is the posterior probability that a patient does not have the disease given a negative test result, $P(D^c|T^-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c) + P(T^-|D)P(D) = S_p(1-p) + (1-S_e)p$$\nThe expression for $NPV$ is:\n$$NPV = \\frac{S_p (1-p)}{S_p (1-p) + (1-S_e)p}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{(0.995)(1-0.01)}{(0.995)(1-0.01) + (1-0.99)(0.01)} = \\frac{(0.995)(0.99)}{0.98505 + (0.01)(0.01)} = \\frac{0.98505}{0.98505 + 0.0001} = \\frac{0.98505}{0.98515}$$\n$$NPV = 0.999898... \\approx 0.9999$$\n\n### Counseling Implications\nThe calculated posterior probabilities form the basis for patient counseling.\n1.  **Interpretation of a Reactive (Positive) Screening Result**: The $PPV$ is $0.6667$. This means that for a pregnant patient with a reactive screening result in this population, there is a $66.7\\%$ probability that she is truly HIV-positive and a $33.3\\%$ probability ($1 - PPV$) that the result is a false positive. It is critical to communicate that a reactive screening test is not a definitive diagnosis but an indicator of high risk that requires confirmation. The term \"reactive\" is often preferred over \"positive\" in initial counseling to emphasize this distinction.\n\n2.  **Role of Immediate Supplemental Testing**: Given the substantial probability ($1$ in $3$) of a false positive, immediate supplemental (confirmatory) testing is mandatory. Guidelines recommend a testing algorithm, often involving an HIV-1/HIV-2 antibody differentiation immunoassay. If results are indeterminate, an HIV-1 nucleic acid test (NAT) is performed. The patient must be informed that a final diagnosis hinges on the results of these more specific tests.\n\n3.  **Risk-Reduction Counseling Pending Confirmation**: While awaiting confirmatory results, the patient should be managed as if she has a true HIV infection (a \"presumptive positive\" status). This is a safety-critical measure to minimize the risk of perinatal (mother-to-child) and sexual transmission. Counseling should include:\n    -   **Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)**: Immediate initiation of a combination ART regimen is recommended to reduce maternal viral load, which is the primary determinant of perinatal transmission risk. The benefits of rapidly suppressing the virus if the infection is real far outweigh the risks of a short course of ART if the confirmatory test is negative.\n    -   **Infant Feeding Plan**: The patient should be counseled on infant feeding options. In settings where safe and affordable alternatives are available, breastfeeding is typically avoided to eliminate this route of transmission.\n    -   **Partner Notification and Testing**: The patient should be counseled on the importance of informing her sexual partner(s), who should also be recommended for HIV testing.\n    -   **Safe Sexual Practices**: The use of condoms should be advised to prevent sexual transmission to partners.\n\nThis strategy, while potentially causing anxiety, is justified by the public health and individual imperative to prevent new HIV infections, especially perinatal transmission. The extremely high $NPV$ of $0.9999$ also provides strong reassurance for patients with a non-reactive (negative) result, meaning there is an exceptionally low probability of a missed infection.",

            "problem": "A prenatal care program conducts universal screening for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) during pregnancy using an initial anti-HCV antibody immunoassay.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "### Solution\nThe primary objective is to calculate the expected number of false positive results in a cohort of $1{,}000$ individuals. A false positive occurs when an individual who is not infected tests positive.\n\nLet $I$ denote the event that a randomly selected individual has a chronic HCV infection, and let $N$ denote the event that the individual does not have the infection. The event $N$ is the complement of $I$.\nLet $T^+$ denote the event of a positive test result from the antibody assay, and $T^-$ denote the event of a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the prevalence of the infection:\n$$ \\Pr(I) = 0.006 $$\nThe probability that a randomly selected individual does not have the infection is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$ \\Pr(N) = 1 - \\Pr(I) = 1 - 0.006 = 0.994 $$\nWe are also given the specificity of the test, which is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual is not infected:\n$$ \\text{Specificity} = \\Pr(T^- \\mid N) = 0.98 $$\nThe probability of a positive test result given that the individual is not infected, $\\Pr(T^+ \\mid N)$, is known as the false positive rate. Since an individual either tests positive or negative, this probability is the complement of the specificity:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\mid N) = 1 - \\Pr(T^- \\mid N) = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02 $$\nA false positive result for a single test corresponds to the joint event that an individual is not infected ($N$) AND tests positive ($T^+$). The probability of this joint event, $\\Pr(T^+ \\cap N)$, can be found using the definition of conditional probability, $\\Pr(A \\cap B) = \\Pr(A \\mid B) \\Pr(B)$:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) = \\Pr(T^+ \\mid N) \\times \\Pr(N) $$\nSubstituting the values we have derived:\n$$ \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) = 0.02 \\times 0.994 = 0.01988 $$\nThis value, $0.01988$, represents the probability that any single, randomly selected individual from this population will be a false positive.\n\nThe problem states that $1{,}000$ independent tests are conducted. The number of false positives can be modeled as a random variable following a binomial distribution. The expected value of this distribution is the number of trials multiplied by the probability of success (a false positive) in any given trial.\n\nTherefore, the expected number of false positives, $E[FP]$, in the cohort of $1{,}000$ tests is:\n$$ E[FP] = N_{total} \\times \\Pr(T^+ \\cap N) $$\n$$ E[FP] = 1{,}000 \\times 0.01988 = 19.88 $$\n\n### Proposed Confirmatory Pathway\n\nTo minimize misclassification, specifically to reduce the number of individuals falsely labeled as infected, a two-step reflex testing strategy is proposed.\n\n1.  **Pathway:** All samples that are reactive (positive) on the initial anti-HCV antibody immunoassay will automatically undergo a second, more specific confirmatory test: a Hepatitis C Virus Nucleic Acid Test (NAT).\n2.  **Final Classification:** An individual is given a final classification of \"infected\" with chronic HCV only if **both** the initial antibody assay and the subsequent NAT are positive. If the initial antibody test is positive but the reflex NAT is negative, the individual is classified as \"not currently infected\". This result may indicate a past, resolved HCV infection, or it may confirm that the initial antibody test was a biological false positive. Individuals who test negative on the initial antibody screen are classified as \"not infected\" and require no further testing.\n3.  **Key Test Characteristic Dependencies:** The overall diagnostic accuracy of this sequential algorithm is a function of the performance characteristics (sensitivity and specificity) of **both** tests. The final number of true positives depends on the product of the sensitivities of the antibody test and the NAT (for those with the infection). The final number of false positives depends on the specificities of both tests. An uninfected person is correctly classified if they test negative on the first test, OR if they test positive on the first and negative on the second. The probability of this is $\\Pr(T^-_{Ab} \\mid N) + \\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^-_{NAT} \\mid N)$.\n4.  **Independence Assumption:** The calculation of the probability of a final false positive in this two-step pathway, $\\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$, requires an assumption of conditional independence. This assumption states that for an uninfected individual (condition $N$), the outcome of the NAT is independent of the outcome of the antibody test. Formally: $\\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N, T^+_{Ab}) = \\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$. This allows one to multiply the individual false positive rates of the two tests: $\\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\cap T^+_{NAT} \\mid N) = \\Pr(T^+_{Ab} \\mid N) \\times \\Pr(T^+_{NAT} \\mid N)$. This assumption is standard for modeling but may not be perfectly true biologically, as some underlying factors in a patient sample might predispose it to false reactivity on multiple assay types.",

            "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of annual live births. The givens are:\n- Total annual live births: $N = 10,000$\n- Maternal HIV prevalence: $P(H) = 0.012$, where $H$ is the event that a mother has HIV.\n- Coverage of ART among pregnant women with HIV: $P(A|H) = 0.80$, where $A$ is the event that a mother with HIV is on ART.\n- Perinatal transmission risk with ART: $P(I|H \\cap A) = 0.005$, where $I$ is the event of infant HIV infection. The conditioning event $H \\cap A$ signifies that the mother has HIV and is on ART.\n- Perinatal transmission risk without ART: $P(I|H \\cap A^c) = 0.15$, where $A^c$ is the event that a mother with HIV is not on ART.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of infant HIV infections, which is given by the total number of births multiplied by the overall probability of an infant being infected, $E[\\text{infections}] = N \\times P(I)$.\n\nTo find the overall probability of infant infection, $P(I)$, we use the law of total probability. The sample space of all births can be partitioned into three mutually exclusive events: the mother does not have HIV ($H^c$), the mother has HIV and is on ART ($H \\cap A$), and the mother has HIV and is not on ART ($H \\cap A^c$).\n\nThe probability of infant infection, $P(I)$, can be expressed as:\n$$P(I) = P(I|H^c)P(H^c) + P(I|H \\cap A)P(H \\cap A) + P(I|H \\cap A^c)P(H \\cap A^c)$$\nAn infant cannot be infected if the mother does not have HIV, so $P(I|H^c) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$P(I) = P(I|H \\cap A)P(H \\cap A) + P(I|H \\cap A^c)P(H \\cap A^c)$$\nWe find the probabilities of the joint events $P(H \\cap A)$ and $P(H \\cap A^c)$ using the definition of conditional probability, $P(X \\cap Y) = P(X|Y)P(Y)$:\n$P(H \\cap A) = P(A|H)P(H) = 0.80 \\times 0.012 = 0.0096$.\n$P(H \\cap A^c) = (1 - P(A|H))P(H) = (1 - 0.80) \\times 0.012 = 0.20 \\times 0.012 = 0.0024$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values back into the equation for $P(I)$:\n$$P(I) = (0.005 \\times 0.0096) + (0.15 \\times 0.0024)$$\n$$P(I) = 0.000048 + 0.000360$$\n$$P(I) = 0.000408$$\nThis is the overall probability of mother-to-child transmission for any given birth in the population.\n\nThe expected number of infant infections per $10,000$ births is:\n$$E[\\text{infections}] = N \\times P(I) = 10,000 \\times 0.000408 = 4.08$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $4.08$ already has three significant figures.\n\nTo determine which component dominates the expected count, we calculate the expected number of infections from each group:\nExpected infections from mothers on ART:\n$$E_{ART} = N \\times P(I \\cap H \\cap A) = 10,000 \\times 0.000048 = 0.48$$\nExpected infections from mothers not on ART:\n$$E_{no-ART} = N \\times P(I \\cap H \\cap A^c) = 10,000 \\times 0.000360 = 3.6$$\nComparing the two components, $3.6 > 0.48$. The group of mothers with HIV who are *not* on ART contributes the majority of the new infant infections. This is because the transmission risk in the non-ART group ($15\\%$) is $30$ times higher than the risk in the ART group ($0.5\\%$), and this massive difference in risk far outweighs the fact that the non-ART group is smaller (constituting $20\\%$ of HIV-positive mothers, compared to $80\\%$ for the ART group). Specifically, the number of HIV-positive mothers is $10,000 \\times 0.012 = 120$. Out of these, $120 \\times 0.20 = 24$ are not on ART, and they contribute $24 \\times 0.15 = 3.6$ infections.
