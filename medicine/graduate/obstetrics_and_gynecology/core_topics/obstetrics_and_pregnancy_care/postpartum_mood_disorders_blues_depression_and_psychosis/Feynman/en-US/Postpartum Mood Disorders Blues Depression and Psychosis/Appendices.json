            "introduction": "The postpartum period is characterized by abrupt shifts in the neuroendocrine environment, which are strongly implicated in mood dysregulation. This exercise provides a quantitative pharmacodynamic model to explore this phenomenon at a molecular level . By calculating the change in receptor occupancy following the rapid decline of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, you will gain a deeper appreciation for how these physiological changes can dramatically alter GABAergic neurotransmission, a key mechanism underlying postpartum mood disorders.",

            "problem": "In a patient with acute postpartum mood symptoms, consider the neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. During late pregnancy, circulating allopregnanolone is elevated, and it declines rapidly after delivery. Assume a simplified pharmacodynamic model in which receptor occupancy is governed by reversible $1:1$ ligand–receptor binding without cooperativity and that the free ligand concentration is approximately equal to the total ligand concentration because the receptor concentration is negligible relative to the ligand concentration. Let the dissociation constant $K_{d}$ be defined by the equilibrium relation $K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$, where $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptor, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor–ligand complex. Define receptor occupancy $O$ as the fraction of total receptors bound by ligand, $O = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$.\n\nIn this patient, suppose the free allopregnanolone concentration declines from $[L]_{\\text{initial}} = 5$ nM late in pregnancy to $[L]_{\\text{final}} = 1$ nM in the early postpartum period, and the dissociation constant is $K_{d} = 2$ nM for the relevant GABA-A receptor binding site.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and the law of mass action, derive the expression for receptor occupancy $O$ as a function of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$ under the stated assumptions. Then compute the change in occupancy defined as $\\Delta O = O_{\\text{final}} - O_{\\text{initial}}$ for the given $[L]_{\\text{initial}}$, $[L]_{\\text{final}}$, and $K_{d}$. Express your final answer as a dimensionless decimal fraction and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requests the change in receptor occupancy associated with a drop in allopregnanolone concentration, using a reversible $1:1$ binding model. The fundamental base comprises the definition of the dissociation constant and the definition of receptor occupancy.\n\nWe begin with the dissociation constant:\n$$\nK_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}.\n$$\nThe receptor occupancy is defined as\n$$\nO = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}.\n$$\nWe seek $O$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$. From the definition of $K_{d}$, solve for $[RL]$ in terms of $[R]$ and $[L]$:\n$$\n[RL] = \\frac{[R][L]}{K_{d}}.\n$$\nSubstitute $[RL]$ into the expression for $O$:\n$$\nO = \\frac{\\frac{[R][L]}{K_{d}}}{[R] + \\frac{[R][L]}{K_{d}}} = \\frac{\\frac{[R][L]}{K_{d}}}{[R]\\left(1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d}}\\right)}.\n$$\nCancel $[R]$ in numerator and denominator:\n$$\nO = \\frac{\\frac{[L]}{K_{d}}}{1 + \\frac{[L]}{K_{d}}}.\n$$\nRewriting, we obtain\n$$\nO = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d}}.\n$$\nThis result additionally uses the assumption that the free ligand concentration $[L]$ reflects the total ligand concentration because the receptor concentration is negligible relative to $[L]$, ensuring that $[L]$ is unaffected by binding.\n\nNext, compute $O_{\\text{initial}}$ and $O_{\\text{final}}$ for the given values.

            "introduction": "Effective clinical management begins with accurate identification, yet screening is more complex than a simple positive or negative result. In practice, a clinician must consider a differential diagnosis across a spectrum of conditions. This problem  simulates a realistic screening scenario that includes postpartum blues, depression, and psychosis, each with distinct prevalences and test sensitivities. Working through this exercise will build your skills in applying Bayesian principles to estimate the true burden of disease within a screened population, a critical task for both individual patient care and public health program evaluation.",

            "problem": "A hospital implements a single-step universal screening protocol on day $5$ postpartum using a tool called the Perinatal Mood Disorder Screen (PMDS). The PMDS triggers a binary positive result when any postpartum mood disorder is present. To make diagnostic categories mutually exclusive at the point of screening, each individual is assigned the most severe category present: postpartum psychosis ($P$) dominates major postpartum depression ($D$), which in turn dominates postpartum blues ($B$); if none apply, the individual is categorized as unaffected ($U$). The true population prevalences are $P(B)=0.60$, $P(D)=0.15$, and $P(P)=0.0015$. The PMDS has category-specific sensitivities $P(+|B)=0.80$, $P(+|D)=0.90$, and $P(+|P)=0.99$, and a specificity among unaffected mothers $P(-|U)=0.85$. All mothers in a cohort of $N=10{,}000$ births are screened.\n\nStarting from the definitions of prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, Bayes’ theorem, and the law of total probability, derive an analytic expression for the posterior probability $P(D \\cup B \\cup P \\mid +)$ that a positive screen corresponds to a true case of any postpartum mood disorder. Then use this result to compute the expected number of true cases among those who screen positive in this cohort.

Let $C$ be the event that a mother has any of these conditions, so $C = B \\cup D \\cup P$. We need to find the expected number of true positives, which can be calculated as $N \\times P(C \\cap +)$, where $+$ denotes a positive screen.\n\nFirst, we determine the prevalences of all four mutually exclusive categories:\n-   Prevalence of Blues: $P(B) = 0.60$\n-   Prevalence of Depression: $P(D) = 0.15$\n-   Prevalence of Psychosis: $P(P) = 0.0015$\n-   The prevalence of unaffected individuals ($U$) is the remainder: $P(U) = 1 - P(B) - P(D) - P(P) = 1 - 0.60 - 0.15 - 0.0015 = 0.2485$.\n\nNext, we use the given sensitivities and specificity to find the probabilities of a positive test for each category:\n-   $P(+|B) = 0.80$\n-   $P(+|D) = 0.90$\n-   $P(+|P) = 0.99$\n-   The specificity is $P(-|U) = 0.85$, so the false positive rate is $P(+|U) = 1 - P(-|U) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$.\n\nThe probability of a true positive result, $P(C \\cap +)$, is the sum of the probabilities of testing positive for each condition, weighted by their prevalence. By the law of total probability:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = P(+|B)P(B) + P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|P)P(P)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P(C \\cap +) = (0.80)(0.60) + (0.90)(0.15) + (0.99)(0.0015)$$\n$$P(C \\cap +) = 0.48 + 0.135 + 0.001485 = 0.616485$$\nThis is the overall probability that a randomly selected mother from the population has a mood disorder AND tests positive.\n\nThe expected number of true cases among those who screen positive is the total number of mothers multiplied by this probability:\n$$E[\\text{True Positives}] = N \\times P(C \\cap +)$$\n$$E[\\text{True Positives}] = 10,000 \\times 0.616485 = 6164.85$$\nThe question asks to round the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$6164.85 \\approx 6165$$\nTherefore, the expected number of true cases among those who screen positive is $6165$.",
