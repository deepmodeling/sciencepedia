This exercise demonstrates how to systematically update a baseline, pre-test probability of ectopic pregnancy using multiple independent risk factors from the patient's history. By applying Bayes' theorem in its powerful odds-likelihood ratio form, you will practice a fundamental skill in evidence-based medicine: integrating disparate clinical findings to arrive at a more precise, patient-specific post-test probability .",

            "problem": "A clinician in an obstetrics and gynecology practice wants to quantify the probability of ectopic pregnancy in a patient before ordering definitive imaging. The practice’s baseline ectopic pregnancy incidence is $1.5\\%$ among all confirmed pregnancies. A hemodynamically stable patient presents early in pregnancy and has three features known to be associated with ectopic pregnancy: current cigarette smoking, a documented prior Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), and conception via In Vitro Fertilization (IVF). From high-quality studies, suppose the positive likelihood ratios for ectopic pregnancy associated with these features are $2.0$, $3.0$, and $4.0$, respectively. Assume these features are conditionally independent given the true disease state (ectopic versus intrauterine), and that the practice-specific pretest probability for ectopic pregnancy equals the baseline incidence.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of probability and odds, and from the general relationship between prior odds, likelihood ratios, and posterior odds implied by Bayes’ theorem, derive the patient’s post-test probability of ectopic pregnancy under the independence assumption and evaluate it numerically. Express your final answer as a decimal and round to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign.",
            "solution": "Let $E$ be the event that the patient has an ectopic pregnancy, and $E^c$ be the event that the pregnancy is intrauterine. Let $F_1$, $F_2$, and $F_3$ be the events of current cigarette smoking, prior PID, and conception via IVF, respectively. The patient presents with all three features, so we consider the combined evidence $F = F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3$.\n\nThe pre-test probability of ectopic pregnancy, $P(E)$, is given as the baseline incidence of $1.5\\%$.\n$$P(E) = 0.015$$\nThe probability of not having an ectopic pregnancy is therefore:\n$$P(E^c) = 1 - P(E) = 1 - 0.015 = 0.985$$\nThe pre-test odds, or prior odds, of ectopic pregnancy are defined as the ratio of the probability of the event to the probability of its complement:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}(E) = \\frac{P(E)}{P(E^c)} = \\frac{0.015}{0.985}$$\nThe post-test probability, $P(E|F)$, is the probability of ectopic pregnancy given the evidence $F$. Bayes' theorem in its odds form states that the post-test odds are the product of the pre-test odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$).\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}(E) = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}(E) \\times LR(F)$$\nThe likelihood ratio for the combined evidence $F$ is defined as:\n$$LR(F) = \\frac{P(F|E)}{P(F|E^c)} = \\frac{P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 | E)}{P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 | E^c)}$$\nThe problem states that the features are conditionally independent given the disease state. This assumption allows us to write the joint conditional probabilities as products of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 | E) = P(F_1|E) \\times P(F_2|E) \\times P(F_3|E)$$\n$$P(F_1 \\cap F_2 \\cap F_3 | E^c) = P(F_1|E^c) \\times P(F_2|E^c) \\times P(F_3|E^c)$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $LR(F)$ yields:\n$$LR(F) = \\frac{P(F_1|E) \\times P(F_2|E) \\times P(F_3|E)}{P(F_1|E^c) \\times P(F_2|E^c) \\times P(F_3|E^c)} = \\left(\\frac{P(F_1|E)}{P(F_1|E^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(F_2|E)}{P(F_2|E^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(F_3|E)}{P(F_3|E^c)}\\right)$$\nEach term in the product is the positive likelihood ratio, $LR_+$, for the corresponding feature.\n$$LR(F) = LR_+(F_1) \\times LR_+(F_2) \\times LR_+(F_3)$$\nWe are given $LR_+(F_1)=2.0$, $LR_+(F_2)=3.0$, and $LR_+(F_3)=4.0$. The combined likelihood ratio is:\n$$LR(F) = 2.0 \\times 3.0 \\times 4.0 = 24.0$$\nNow, we can calculate the post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}(E) = \\left(\\frac{0.015}{0.985}\\right) \\times 24.0 = \\frac{0.36}{0.985}$$\nThe final step is to convert the post-test odds back to a probability.

This practice problem focuses on the interpretation of serial beta human chorionic gonadotropin ($\\beta$-hCG) levels following methotrexate administration, a cornerstone of non-surgical management. You will apply a kinetic model to understand the expected trends and use established clinical criteria to differentiate a successful response from treatment failure, thereby honing your skills in data-driven clinical management .",

            "problem": "A hemodynamically stable patient with a confirmed tubal ectopic pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound (no fetal cardiac activity; adnexal mass diameter $2.1$ cm; no hemoperitoneum) is managed medically with a single-dose intramuscular folate antagonist Methotrexate (MTX). There are no contraindications to MTX (aspartate aminotransferase $24$ U/L, alanine aminotransferase $19$ U/L, creatinine $0.8$ mg/dL, normal complete blood count). Beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) is trended as follows using the same laboratory: at $t=-48$ hours (pre-MTX) $H_{-48} = 1900$ IU/L, at $t=0$ hours (immediately before MTX) $H_{0} = 2500$ IU/L. Post-MTX, measured values are $H_{4} = 3050$ IU/L on day $4$ and $H_{7} = 2700$ IU/L on day $7$.\n\nUse the following foundational modeling framework:\n- Before MTX, trophoblast-driven β-hCG production follows first-order growth, $H(t) = H_{0}\\exp(r t)$, where $r$ is the constant net growth rate (per day), and $t$ is in days relative to $t=0$.\n- After MTX, successful cytoreduction is monitored by the fractional decline between day $4$ and day $7$, defined as $f = \\frac{H_{4} - H_{7}}{H_{4}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of obstetrics and gynecology, specifically the medical management of ectopic pregnancy using methotrexate (MTX) and β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) monitoring. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The language is objective and the scenario is clinically realistic. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution addresses the three tasks in sequence to provide a complete and reasoned analysis.\n\n**Task 1: Infer pre-treatment growth rate and compute the counterfactual β-hCG level.**\n\nThe pre-treatment growth of β-hCG is modeled by the first-order kinetic equation $H(t) = H_{0}\\exp(r t)$, where $t$ is time in days and $r$ is the net growth rate constant in units of $\\text{day}^{-1}$. We are given two data points prior to the administration of MTX at $t=0$: $H_{0} = H(0) = 2500$ IU/L and $H_{-48} = H(-2 \\text{ days}) = 1900$ IU/L.\n\nWe use the data point at $t=-2$ days to solve for the growth rate $r$.\n$$H(-2) = H_{0}\\exp(r \\times (-2))$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$1900 = 2500 \\exp(-2r)$$\nTo solve for $r$, we first isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\frac{1900}{2500} = \\exp(-2r)$$\n$$\\frac{19}{25} = \\exp(-2r)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{25}\\right) = -2r$$\nSolving for $r$:\n$$r = -\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{19}{25}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{19}{25}\\right)^{-1}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right)$$\nThe pre-treatment growth rate is $r = \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right) \\text{ day}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we compute the counterfactual β-hCG level at day $4$, denoted $H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}}$, which represents the level that would have been reached if the MTX had no effect and the pre-treatment growth continued unabated.\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = H_{0}\\exp(4r)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $r$:\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = H_{0}\\exp\\left(4 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right) \\right]\\right)$$\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = H_{0}\\exp\\left(2\\ln\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right)\\right)$$\nUsing the property of logarithms $a\\ln(b) = \\ln(b^a)$:\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = H_{0}\\exp\\left(\\ln\\left[\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right)^2\\right]\\right)$$\nSince $\\exp(\\ln(x)) = x$:\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = H_{0}\\left(\\frac{25}{19}\\right)^2$$\nSubstituting $H_0 = 2500$:\n$$H_{4}^{\\mathrm{counterfactual}} = 2500 \\left(\\frac{625}{361}\\right) \\approx 4328.25 \\text{ IU/L}$$\nThis value is substantially higher than the observed $H_{4} = 3050$ IU/L, indicating that the MTX has already exerted a significant cytostatic, if not yet fully cytotoxic, effect by day $4$.\n\n**Task 2: Compute the maximum $H_{7}$ for successful treatment.**\n\nSuccessful treatment is defined by a fractional decline $f$ of at least $15\\%$, or $f \\ge 0.15$. The fractional decline is defined as $f = \\frac{H_{4} - H_{7}}{H_{4}}$. We are asked to find the maximum value of $H_7$ that satisfies this condition, given the measured $H_{4} = 3050$ IU/L.\n$$\\frac{H_{4} - H_{7}}{H_{4}} \\ge 0.15$$\nSubstituting the value for $H_4$:\n$$\\frac{3050 - H_{7}}{3050} \\ge 0.15$$\nTo find the maximum allowed $H_7$, we solve the equality condition and note that any smaller $H_7$ would also satisfy the inequality.\n$$3050 - H_{7} \\ge 0.15 \\times 3050$$\n$$3050 - H_{7} \\ge 457.5$$\n$$-H_{7} \\ge 457.5 - 3050$$\n$$-H_{7} \\ge -2592.5$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$H_{7} \\le 2592.5$$\nThus, the maximum β-hCG level on day $7$ that would be consistent with treatment success is $2592.5$ IU/L.\n\n**Task 3: Compute observed fractional decline, classify success/failure, and propose next step.**\n\nThis is the primary computational task for the final answer. We use the observed data: $H_{4} = 3050$ IU/L and $H_{7} = 2700$ IU/L.\nThe fractional decline $f$ is computed as:\n$$f = \\frac{H_{4} - H_{7}}{H_{4}} = \\frac{3050 - 2700}{3050}$$\n$$f = \\frac{350}{3050} = \\frac{35}{305}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $5$:\n$$f = \\frac{7}{61}$$\nTo compare this with the clinical threshold, we convert the fraction to a decimal:\n$$f = \\frac{7}{61} \\approx 0.114754098...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as specified:\n$$f \\approx 0.1148$$\n\n**Classification:** The criterion for success is $f \\ge 0.15$. The calculated value is $f \\approx 0.1148$. Since $0.1148  0.15$, the response to the single-dose MTX regimen is classified as a **treatment failure**.\n\n**Proposed Next Management Step:** The failure of the β-hCG level to decline by at least $15\\%$ between day $4$ and day $7$ indicates insufficient cytotoxic response from the initial MTX dose. Given that the patient remains hemodynamically stable and was initially a good candidate for medical management (adnexal mass diameter $ 3.5$ cm, initial β-hCG $ 5000$ IU/L, no fetal cardiac activity), the standard clinical protocol would be to offer a second dose of MTX. Surgical management (e.g., salpingostomy or salpingectomy) would be reserved for patients who fail the multi-dose MTX protocol, become hemodynamically unstable, show evidence of tubal rupture, or develop contraindications to continued MTX therapy. Therefore, the next appropriate step is the administration of a second dose of MTX, with continued β-hCG surveillance.",

            "problem": "A hemodynamically stable patient with a confirmed tubal ectopic pregnancy meets established criteria for medical management with methotrexate. The single-dose regimen uses a dose of $50~\\mathrm{mg/m^2}$ based on Body Surface Area (BSA). The Body Surface Area (BSA) is to be computed using the Mosteller formula, which is a well-validated clinical approximation for BSA in adults: \n$$\n\\mathrm{BSA}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{height}~(\\mathrm{cm})\\times \\text{weight}~(\\mathrm{kg})}{3600}}.\n$$\nThe patient’s height is $165~\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight is $70~\\mathrm{kg}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of a patient-specific methotrexate dose based on Body Surface Area (BSA) and a subsequent rounding of this dose according to a defined institutional policy for vial selection. The process involves three main steps: calculating the BSA, calculating the ideal drug dose, and applying the rounding rule to determine the final administered dose.\n\nFirst, we calculate the patient's BSA using the provided Mosteller formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{BSA} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{height}~(\\mathrm{cm})\\times \\text{weight}~(\\mathrm{kg})}{3600}}\n$$\nThe problem states the patient's height is $165~\\mathrm{cm}$ and weight is $70~\\mathrm{kg}$.

The specified single-dose regimen is $50~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2}$. The dose is therefore the product of this rate and the patient's BSA:\n$$\nD_{calc} = 50~\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} \\times \\mathrm{BSA}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for BSA from the first step:\n$$\nD_{calc} = 50 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{11550}{3600}}~\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\nTo apply the rounding policy, it is necessary to evaluate this expression numerically:\n$$\nD_{calc} = 50 \\times \\sqrt{3.208333...}~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 50 \\times 1.7911819...~\\mathrm{mg} \\approx 89.55909...~\\mathrm{mg}\n$$\n\nThird, we apply the institutional policy for selecting the final administered dose, $D_{admin}$. The pharmacy provides single-use vials of $50~\\mathrm{mg}$ and $100~\\mathrm{mg}$. Since only whole vials can be dispensed, any combination of these vials will result in a total dose that is a multiple of $50~\\mathrm{mg}$ (e.g., $50~\\mathrm{mg}$, $100~\\mathrm{mg}$, $150~\\mathrm{mg}$, etc.). The policy is to select the dispensed dose that minimizes the absolute difference from the calculated dose, $D_{calc}$.\n\nThe calculated dose, $D_{calc} \\approx 89.559~\\mathrm{mg}$, is bracketed by two possible dispensed doses: $D_1 = 50~\\mathrm{mg}$ and $D_2 = 100~\\mathrm{mg}$. We must determine which of these is closer to $D_{calc}$ by comparing the absolute differences.\n\n1.  The absolute difference for the $50~\\mathrm{mg}$ dose ($D_1$):\n    $$\n    |D_{calc} - D_1| = |89.55909... - 50| = 39.55909...~\\mathrm{mg}\n    $$\n2.  The absolute difference for the $100~\\mathrm{mg}$ dose ($D_2$):\n    $$\n    |D_{calc} - D_2| = |89.55909... - 100| = |-10.44091...| = 10.44091...~\\mathrm{mg}\n    $$\n\nComparing the two absolute differences, we find that:\n$$\n10.44091...  39.55909...\n$$\nThis inequality demonstrates that the absolute difference is smaller for the $100~\\mathrm{mg}$ dose. According to the policy, we must select the dose that minimizes this difference. Therefore, the appropriate dose to administer is $100~\\mathrm{mg}$.\n\nThe policy includes a tie-breaker rule: \"if there is an exact tie, select the higher total\". A tie would occur only if the calculated dose were exactly midway between two possible doses, for example, $75~\\mathrm{mg}$ (which is halfway between $50~\\mathrm{mg}$ and $100~\\mathrm{mg}$). Since $D_{calc} \\approx 89.559~\\mathrm{mg}$, there is no tie, and the tie-breaker rule is not invoked.\n\nThe final dose to be administered is $100~\\mathrm{mg}$. The information regarding the methotrexate concentration ($25~\\mathrm{mg/mL}$) is irrelevant to the determination of the total dose in milligrams.",
