Positive Predictive Value (PPV): $P(D \\mid T^+)$.\n    2. Negative Predictive Value (NPV): $P(D^c \\mid T^-)$.\n- Constraint: Use only fundamental definitions of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, and conditional probability.\n- Output format: Exact fractions in simplest terms for PPV and NPV, in that order.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the field of biostatistics and epidemiology, specifically applied to obstetrics. The concepts of sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, PPV, and NPV are standard metrics for evaluating diagnostic tests. The values provided for prevalence ($2\\%$), sensitivity ($60\\%$), and specificity ($90\\%$) are plausible for ultrasound prediction of fetal macrosomia, a known clinical challenge. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to compute the requested values. It is objective and free of ambiguity or contradiction. The problem is formalizable and relevant to its stated topic. Therefore, a problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $D$ be the event that a fetus has macrosomia (birthweight $\\geq 4500\\ \\mathrm{g}$), and let $D^c$ be the event that the fetus does not have macrosomia.\nLet $T^+$ be the event that the ultrasound test is positive for macrosomia, and let $T^-$ be the event that the test is negative.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence of macrosomia: $P(D) = 0.02$.\n- The probability of not having macrosomia is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.02 = 0.98$.\n- Sensitivity of the test: $P(T^+ \\mid D) = 0.60$. This is the probability of a true positive.\n- Specificity of the test: $P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 0.90$. This is the probability of a true negative.\n\nFrom the sensitivity and specificity, we can derive the probabilities of the complementary conditional events:\n- The false negative rate, which is the probability of a negative test given that disease is present: $P(T^- \\mid D) = 1 - P(T^+ \\mid D) = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40$.\n- The false positive rate, which is the probability of a positive test given that disease is absent: $P(T^+ \\mid D^c) = 1 - P(T^- \\mid D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$.\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value (PPV) is defined as $P(D \\mid T^+)$, the probability that the disease is present given a positive test result. Using the definition of conditional probability (Bayes' theorem), we have:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = P(D \\mid T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, which can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^+) = P(T^+ \\mid D) P(D) + P(T^+ \\mid D^c) P(D^c)\n$$\nSubstituting the given and derived values:\n$$\nP(T^+) = (0.60)(0.02) + (0.10)(0.98) = 0.012 + 0.098 = 0.110\n$$\nNow we can compute the PPV:\n$$\n\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.012}{0.110} = \\frac{12}{110} = \\frac{6}{55}\n$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value (NPV) is defined as $P(D^c \\mid T^-)$, the probability that the disease is absent given a negative test result. Applying Bayes' theorem:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = P(D^c \\mid T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- \\mid D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}\n$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test. It can be computed similarly using the law of total probability:\n$$\nP(T^-) = P(T^- \\mid D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- \\mid D) P(D)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nP(T^-) = (0.90)(0.98) + (0.40)(0.02) = 0.882 + 0.008 = 0.890\n$$\nAlternatively, since there are only two test outcomes (positive or negative), $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+) = 1 - 0.110 = 0.890$. The consistency confirms the calculation.\nNow we can compute the NPV:\n$$\n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.882}{0.890} = \\frac{882}{890} = \\frac{441}{445}\n$$\nThe fraction $\\frac{441}{445}$ is in simplest terms, as the prime factorization of the numerator is $441 = 3^2 \\times 7^2$ and the prime factorization of the denominator is $445 = 5 \\times 89$. There are no common factors.\n\nThe requested values are the PPV and NPV, expressed as exact fractions in that order.",

The problem specifies a method using odds and likelihood ratios, which is a common formulation of the theorem in clinical epidemiology.\n\nLet $M$ be the event that the fetus is macrosomic.\nLet $T^{+}$ be the event of a positive test result (EFW exceeds the threshold).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n- The pretest probability of macrosomia, $P(M) = 0.08$.\n- The positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{+} = 6$.\n\nThe goal is to calculate the post-test probability of macrosomia given the positive test result, $P(M|T^{+})$.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps:\n1.  Convert the pretest probability to pretest odds.\n2.  Update the pretest odds to post-test odds using the likelihood ratio.\n3.  Convert the post-test odds back to a probability.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Pretest Odds**\nThe odds of an event are defined as the ratio of the probability that the event occurs to the probability that it does not occur. The pretest odds of macrosomia, $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}}$, are:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{P(M)}{1 - P(M)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given pretest probability:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} = \\frac{0.08}{1 - 0.08} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate Post-test Odds**\nThe relationship between pretest odds, post-test odds, and the likelihood ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR}\n$$\nSince the test result is positive, we use the positive likelihood ratio, $\\text{LR}^{+}$.\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\text{Odds}_{\\text{pre}} \\times \\text{LR}^{+}\n$$\nSubstituting the values from Step 1 and the problem statement:\n$$\n\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}} = \\left(\\frac{0.08}{0.92}\\right) \\times 6 = \\frac{0.48}{0.92}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Convert Post-test Odds to Post-test Probability**\nA probability can be recovered from odds using the formula:\n$$\n\\text{Probability} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}}{1 + \\text{Odds}}\n$$\nThe post-test probability, $P(M|T^{+})$, is therefore:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}{1 + \\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\text{Odds}_{\\text{post}}$:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{\\frac{0.48}{0.92}}{1 + \\frac{0.48}{0.92}}\n$$\nTo simplify this complex fraction, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $0.92$:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{0.48}{0.92 \\times \\left(1 + \\frac{0.48}{0.92}\\right)} = \\frac{0.48}{0.92 + 0.48} = \\frac{0.48}{1.40}\n$$\nThis fraction can be expressed in simpler terms:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{48}{140} = \\frac{12}{35}\n$$\nTo provide the final answer as a decimal rounded to four significant figures, we perform the division:\n$$\nP(M|T^{+}) = \\frac{12}{35} \\approx 0.34285714...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $0.3429$.",

            "solution": "The problem is determined to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in epidemiological principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. It presents a standard calculation in evidence-based medicine without any scientific flaws or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) and the Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) based on data from a randomized controlled trial comparing planned induction of labor at $39$ weeks (the treatment) against expectant management (the control). The outcome of interest is shoulder dystocia.\n\nLet $R_c$ denote the risk of the event in the control group (expectant management) and $R_t$ denote the risk of the event in the treatment group (induction of labor). The problem states these risks as percentages.\n\nThe risk in the control group is given as $R_c = 3\\%$.\nThe risk in the treatment group is given as $R_t = 1.5\\%$.\n\nFor calculations, these percentages must be converted to their decimal forms, which represent probabilities:\n$R_c = \\frac{3}{100} = 0.03$\n$R_t = \\frac{1.5}{100} = 0.015$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Reduction ($ARR$) is defined as the absolute difference between the event rate in the control group and the event rate in the treatment group. It quantifies the reduction in risk attributable to the intervention.\n$$ARR = R_c - R_t$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ARR = 0.03 - 0.015 = 0.015$$\nThe problem requires the $ARR$ to be expressed as a decimal rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.015$ has two significant figures (the digits $1$ and $5$). To express this value with four significant figures, we append two trailing zeros:\n$$ARR = 0.01500$$\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is the reciprocal of the $ARR$. It represents the average number of patients who must be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$$\nUsing the exact, unrounded value of $ARR$ for this calculation ensures accuracy.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.015}$$\nWe can express the decimal as a fraction to simplify the calculation:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{\\frac{15}{1000}} = \\frac{1000}{15}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, $5$:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1000 \\div 5}{15 \\div 5} = \\frac{200}{3}$$\nThe decimal representation of this fraction is a repeating decimal:\n$$NNT = 66.666...$$\nThe problem specifies that the $NNT$ must be reported using the conventional definition that it is rounded up to the next whole number. This convention is used because a fraction of a patient cannot be treated, and treating only $66$ patients would, on average, be insufficient to prevent one event. Therefore, to ensure the prevention of one full event, the number must be rounded up.\n$$NNT = 67$$\n\nThe final answer consists of the calculated values for the absolute risk reduction and the Number Needed to Treat, in that order.\nThe absolute risk reduction is $0.01500$.\nThe Number Needed to Treat is $67$.",
