            "solution": "The problem asks for the posterior probability of malignancy of an adnexal mass in a pregnant patient, given a pretest probability and two pieces of conditionally independent diagnostic information summarized by their likelihood ratios. The solution must be derived from first principles using the odds form of Bayes' theorem.\n\nLet $M$ denote the event that the adnexal mass is malignant, and $M^c$ denote the event that it is benign. Let $E_1$ be the evidence from the Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) test, and $E_2$ be the evidence from the ultrasound morphology. The problem provides the following information:\n- The pretest probability of malignancy: $P(M) = 0.03$.\n- The likelihood ratio for malignancy associated with the CA-125 finding: $LR_1 = \\frac{P(E_1|M)}{P(E_1|M^c)} = 1.2$.\n- The likelihood ratio for malignancy associated with the ultrasound finding: $LR_2 = \\frac{P(E_2|M)}{P(E_2|M^c)} = 0.3$.\n- The assumption that $E_1$ and $E_2$ are conditionally independent given the disease state ($M$ or $M^c$).\n\nFirst, as required, we derive Bayes' theorem in odds form from the definitions of probability and odds.

The combined likelihood ratio, $LR_{comb}$, for the joint evidence $E = (E_1, E_2)$ is:\n$$ LR_{comb} = \\frac{P(E_1, E_2|M)}{P(E_1, E_2|M^c)} $$\nDue to conditional independence, $P(E_1, E_2|M) = P(E_1|M)P(E_2|M)$ and $P(E_1, E_2|M^c) = P(E_1|M^c)P(E_2|M^c)$.

            "problem": "A pregnant patient at $12$ weeks presents with intermittent unilateral pelvic pain. Ultrasound identifies a benign-appearing ovarian dermoid (mature cystic teratoma) measuring $6$ cm in maximal diameter, with no features suspicious for malignancy and normal Doppler flow at rest. Consider a simplified institutional risk model that estimates the probability of ovarian torsion for an adnexal mass in early pregnancy using a linear function anchored at a clinically relevant size threshold: the baseline torsion probability at $5$ cm is $0.10$, and the probability increases by $0.02$ per centimeter above $5$ cm.

If you perform any rounding, round to three significant figures. Do not include a percentage sign in your answer.",
            "solution": "The problem presents a clinical scenario requiring a two-part analysis. First, a quantitative calculation of ovarian torsion probability using a given simplified mathematical model. Second, a reasoned justification for a clinical management strategy based on the synthesis of provided patient data and established medical principles.\n\nFirst, we address the calculation of the torsion probability. The problem defines a simplified risk model for an adnexal mass of size $S$, measured in centimeters. Let $P(S)$ denote the probability of ovarian torsion. The model is specified as a piecewise linear function. The baseline probability for a mass of size $S_0 = 5$ cm is given as $P(S_0) = 0.10$. For any mass larger than $5$ cm, the probability increases at a constant rate of $k = 0.02$ per centimeter of additional diameter. For masses with a diameter $S \\le 5$ cm, the probability remains at the baseline value of $0.10$. This model can be expressed mathematically as:\n$$ P(S) = \\begin{cases} 0.10 & \\text{if } S \\le 5 \\\\ 0.10 + k(S - 5) & \\text{if } S > 5 \\end{cases} $$\nwhere the rate of increase is $k = 0.02$.\n\nThe patient in the problem has an ovarian dermoid with a maximal diameter of $S = 6$ cm. Since the size $S=6$ cm is greater than the threshold size $S_0 = 5$ cm, we use the second branch of the function to compute the probability:\n$$ P(S=6) = 0.10 + 0.02 \\times (6 - 5) $$\nPerforming the arithmetic:\n$$ P(6) = 0.10 + 0.02 \\times 1 $$\n$$ P(6) = 0.12 $$\nAccording to the specified model, the estimated probability of ovarian torsion for this patient’s $6$ cm mass is $0.12$.\n\nNext, we provide a justification for a clinical management choice from the options of expectant management, urgent intervention, or planned interval surgery in the second trimester. This justification must integrate the specific clinical facts of the case: a gestational age of $12$ weeks, intermittent unilateral pelvic pain, and a $6$ cm benign-appearing ovarian dermoid.\n\n1.  **Mass Characteristics and Torsion Risk**: A $6$ cm adnexal mass during pregnancy is clinically significant. The risk of adnexal torsion, a twisting of the ovary on its ligamentous supports cutting off its blood supply, increases with mass size, with a notable rise in risk for masses exceeding $5$ cm. The calculated probability of $0.12$ (or $12\\%$), while derived from a simplified model, reflects a substantial clinical risk. Mature cystic teratomas (dermoids) are particularly prone to torsion due to their typical consistency and tendency to be pedunculated (on a stalk), which increases their mobility.\n\n2.  **Symptomatology**: The patient's presenting symptom of intermittent unilateral pelvic pain is highly concerning. In the presence of a $6$ cm adnexal mass, this symptom pattern is strongly suggestive of intermittent torsion and detorsion, where the ovary twists and spontaneously untwists. This is a significant warning sign, as it can progress to established, acute torsion—a true surgical emergency that can lead to ovarian necrosis, infection, and increased risk of pregnancy loss if not treated promptly. Normal Doppler flow at rest does not exclude intermittent torsion.\n\n3.  **Gestational Age and Surgical Timing**: The patient is at $12$ weeks gestation, the end of the first trimester. The second trimester (generally weeks $14$ through $27$) is widely established as the safest period for non-emergent surgery during pregnancy. Operating during this window minimizes the baseline risk of spontaneous abortion associated with the first trimester and avoids the technical challenges presented by the large size of the uterus in the third trimester.\n\nSynthesizing these points leads to a definitive management recommendation:\n-   **Expectant management** would be an unsafe choice. The combination of a high-risk mass size ($6$ cm) and symptoms strongly suggestive of intermittent torsion (intermittent pain) creates a high likelihood of progression to an acute emergency. A \"wait-and-see\" approach would subject the patient and her pregnancy to the greater dangers of emergency surgery.\n-   **Urgent intervention** is not immediately warranted. This path is reserved for patients with signs of acute, ongoing torsion, such as severe and persistent pain, peritoneal signs, and/or compromised blood flow on ultrasound. As the patient's pain is intermittent and Doppler flow is normal, an emergency procedure is not indicated at this moment.\n-   **Planned interval surgery in the second trimester** is the most prudent and logical management strategy. This approach resolves the clinical problem definitively by removing the at-risk mass, thereby eliminating the threat of torsion, rupture, or dystocia (obstruction of labor) later in pregnancy. Scheduling the procedure for the early second trimester (e.g., at $14-16$ weeks) strategically balances the risk of the mass against the risks of surgery, optimizing for maternal and fetal safety. It transforms a potential emergency into a controlled, elective procedure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate management is planned interval surgery, justified by the patient's symptomatic presentation in the context of a $6$ cm mass, which portends a high risk of acute torsion, combined with the opportunity to operate during the optimal surgical window of the second trimester.",
