            "problem": "A pregnant patient with suspected fetal growth restriction presents for Doppler velocimetry assessment of the umbilical artery at gestational age $32$ weeks $4$ days. The Doppler waveform has the following validated measurements averaged over $3$ consecutive cardiac cycles: peak systolic velocity $42\\,\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$, end-diastolic velocity $9\\,\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$, and time-averaged mean velocity $22\\,\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$. A validated nomogram indicates that, at $32$ weeks $4$ days, the $95$th percentile value for the umbilical artery pulsatility index is $1.36$. Using only standard definitions of vascular Doppler waveform indices based on peak systolic velocity, end-diastolic velocity, and cycle-averaged mean velocity, compute the umbilical artery pulsatility index and determine whether it is above or below the $95$th percentile threshold. Then, based on that classification, state how fetal surveillance intensity should change for evidence-based management of suspected fetal growth restriction. Express the computed pulsatility index as a unitless number and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Doppler velocimetry and its clinical application in obstetrics. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary and consistent data for the calculation of the requested index. The values are physiologically plausible, and the clinical context is standard practice for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the umbilical artery pulsatility index ($PI$) and interpret its clinical significance. The pulsatility index, a quantitative measure of vascular impedance downstream from the point of measurement, is defined by the formula:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{PSV - EDV}{TAMV}\n$$\nwhere $PSV$ is the peak systolic velocity, $EDV$ is the end-diastolic velocity, and $TAMV$ is the time-averaged mean velocity over the cardiac cycle.\n\nThe problem provides the following data, measured from the umbilical artery Doppler waveform:\n- Peak systolic velocity, $PSV = 42 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- End-diastolic velocity, $EDV = 9 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n- Time-averaged mean velocity, $TAMV = 22 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the definition for the $PI$:\n$$\nPI = \\frac{42 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}} - 9 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}}{22 \\, \\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}}\n$$\nThe units of velocity ($\\mathrm{cm \\cdot s^{-1}}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, rendering the $PI$ a dimensionless quantity, as expected.\n$$\nPI = \\frac{33}{22} = \\frac{3}{2} = 1.5\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the computed pulsatility index is $1.50$.\n\nThe next step is to compare this computed value to the provided normative threshold. The gestational age is $32$ weeks and $4$ days, for which the $95$th percentile value for the umbilical artery $PI$ is given as $1.36$.\n- Computed $PI = 1.50$\n- $95$th percentile threshold = $1.36$\n\nThe comparison yields $1.50 > 1.36$. This demonstrates that the measured umbilical artery $PI$ is abnormally elevated, as it exceeds the $95$th percentile for the specified gestational age.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the clinical management implication of this finding. An elevated umbilical artery $PI$ is indicative of increased vascular resistance in the placental circulation. This is a key pathophysiological finding in fetal growth restriction and is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. According to established, evidence-based guidelines for the management of suspected fetal growth restriction, the finding of an umbilical artery $PI > 95$th percentile is a critical determinant of fetal risk and mandates an increase in the intensity and frequency of fetal surveillance. Therefore, the surveillance plan should be escalated from routine (e.g., weekly) to more frequent monitoring. This typically involves bi-weekly (i.e., twice-weekly) fetal heart rate monitoring (non-stress tests) and/or biophysical profiles, along with serial follow-up Doppler assessments to detect any further deterioration, such as the progression to absent or reversed end-diastolic velocity, which would further heighten concern and potentially prompt intervention such as corticosteroid administration and delivery.",

            "problem": "A nulliparous patient at gestational age $36$ weeks $+2$ days is under evaluation for late-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR).

            "solution": "The principles of this problem are rooted in the clinical management of late-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR), which relies on a structured evaluation of fetal well-being using Doppler ultrasonography. The key parameters are the Pulsatility Index (PI) of the Umbilical Artery (UA) and the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA).\n\nThe first step is to validate the problem statement.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Current gestational age: $36$ weeks $+2$ days\n- Patient parity: nulliparous\n- Condition under evaluation: late-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR)\n- Estimated fetal weight: $7$th centile\n- Umbilical Artery Pulsatility Index (UA PI): $1.05$\n- Middle Cerebral Artery Pulsatility Index (MCA PI): $1.15$\n- UA end-diastolic flow: not absent or reversed\n- Definition of late-onset FGR: gestational age $\\ge 32$ weeks\n- Definition of cerebroplacental ratio (CPR): an index comparing MCA PI and UA PI.\n- Clinical threshold for abnormal CPR (10th centile) at $36$-$37$ weeks: value $ 1.25$\n- Clinical threshold for abnormal UA PI (95th centile) at this gestation: value $> 1.10$\n- Delivery Rule 1: If $\\text{UA PI} > 1.10$ or $\\text{CPR}  1.25$, recommend delivery at $37$ weeks $+0$ days.\n- Delivery Rule 2: If $\\text{UA PI} \\le 1.10$ and $\\text{CPR} \\ge 1.25$, recommend delivery at $38$ weeks $+5$ days.\n- Task: Compute the CPR, apply the decision rules, and determine the number of days from the current date until the recommended delivery date.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, using established concepts and realistic values from obstetrics. It is well-posed, providing all necessary data and clear, objective criteria for a unique solution. The definition of CPR, while not providing an explicit formula, refers to the universally accepted standard ratio in this medical context. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and formalizable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution process follows the logic of the clinical management protocol provided.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the cerebroplacental ratio (CPR). The CPR is defined as the ratio of the MCA PI to the UA PI. This ratio reflects the redistribution of fetal blood flow, a key adaptation to placental insufficiency known as the \"brain-sparing\" effect.\nThe formula is:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{\\text{MCA PI}}{\\text{UA PI}} $$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{1.15}{1.05} $$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $100$:\n$$ \\text{CPR} = \\frac{115}{105} = \\frac{23 \\times 5}{21 \\times 5} = \\frac{23}{21} $$\nFor comparison purposes, we can evaluate this ratio numerically:\n$$ \\text{CPR} \\approx 1.095238... $$\n\nNext, we apply the provided decision-making framework to determine the recommended timing of delivery. The framework is based on two conditions: the UA PI value and the CPR value.\n\nCondition check for Rule 1: We must evaluate if either \"$\\text{UA PI} > 95\\text{th centile}$\" or \"$\\text{CPR}  10\\text{th centile}$\" is true.\n1.  Check the UA PI: The patient's UA PI is $1.05$. The threshold for the $95$th centile is given as $1.10$. Is $1.05 > 1.10$? This is false.\n2.  Check the CPR: The calculated CPR is $\\frac{23}{21} \\approx 1.095$. The threshold for the $10$th centile is given as $1.25$. Is $1.095  1.25$? This is true.\n\nThe logical condition for Rule 1 is a disjunction (an \"OR\" statement): ($\\text{UA PI} > 1.10$) OR ($\\text{CPR}  1.25$).\nSince the first part is false and the second part is true, the entire statement (False OR True) evaluates to True. Therefore, Rule 1 applies.\n\nAccording to Rule 1, the recommended timing of delivery is $37$ weeks $+0$ days.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the number of days between the current gestational age and the recommended delivery date.\n- Current gestational age: $36$ weeks $+2$ days.\n- Recommended delivery gestational age: $37$ weeks $+0$ days.\n\nTo find the interval in days, we can express both dates as a total number of days from the beginning of gestation (a week is defined as $7$ days).\n- Current age in days = $(36 \\times 7) + 2 = 252 + 2 = 254$ days.\n- Delivery age in days = $(37 \\times 7) + 0 = 259$ days.\n\nThe number of days from today until delivery is the difference between these two values:\n$$ \\text{Days until delivery} = (\\text{Delivery age in days}) - (\\text{Current age in days}) $$\n$$ \\text{Days until delivery} = 259 - 254 = 5 $$\nAlternatively, one can reason that the time difference is $(37 weeks - 36 weeks) + (0 days - 2 days)$. This equals $1$ week $- 2$ days, which is $7$ days $- 2$ days $= 5$ days.\n\nThe recommended delivery is in $5$ days.",

It is free of subjective claims.\n- The problem does not exhibit any other flaws such as incompleteness, contradiction, infeasibility, or triviality.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Computation of Posterior Probability\n\nThe problem requires the computation of the posterior probability of the composite adverse perinatal outcome given that both low CPR and oligohydramnios are present. This is a direct application of Bayes' theorem, which is most conveniently handled in its odds-likelihood ratio form.\n\nLet $A$ denote the event that the composite adverse perinatal outcome occurs. The problem provides the prior probability of this event, $P(A) = p_0 = 0.18$.\nLet $E_1$ denote the finding of a low CPR.\nLet $E_2$ denote the finding of oligohydramnios.\nWe are interested in the posterior probability of $A$ given that both findings are present, which is $P(A|E_1 \\cap E_2)$.\n\nFirst, we convert the prior probability, $p_0$, into prior odds, $O_{prior}$. The odds of an event are defined as the ratio of its probability of occurring to its probability of not occurring.\n$$O_{prior} = \\frac{P(A)}{P(A^c)} = \\frac{p_0}{1 - p_0}$$\nSubstituting the given value $p_0 = 0.18$:\n$$O_{prior} = \\frac{0.18}{1 - 0.18} = \\frac{0.18}{0.82}$$\n\nNext, we use the odds form of Bayes' theorem, which states that the posterior odds are the product of the prior odds and the likelihood ratio ($LR$) of the evidence.\n$$O_{posterior} = LR \\times O_{prior}$$\nThe evidence here is the co-occurrence of low CPR and oligohydramnios ($E_1 \\cap E_2$). The corresponding likelihood ratio is the joint positive likelihood ratio, $LR_{joint}^{+}$, which is given by:\n$$LR_{joint}^{+} = k \\times LR_{CPR}^{+} \\times LR_{oligo}^{+}$$\nSubstituting the given values $k = 0.85$, $LR_{CPR}^{+} = 3.2$, and $LR_{oligo}^{+} = 2.1$:\n$$LR_{joint}^{+} = 0.85 \\times 3.2 \\times 2.1 = 5.712$$\n\nNow we can calculate the posterior odds, $O_{posterior}$, which are the odds of the adverse outcome given both findings.\n$$O_{posterior} = O(A|E_1 \\cap E_2) = LR_{joint}^{+} \\times O_{prior}$$\n$$O_{posterior} = 5.712 \\times \\frac{0.18}{0.82}$$\n$$O_{posterior} \\approx 1.2538536585$$\n\nFinally, we convert the posterior odds back into a posterior probability, $p_{posterior} = P(A|E_1 \\cap E_2)$.\n$$p_{posterior} = \\frac{O_{posterior}}{1 + O_{posterior}}$$\n$$p_{posterior} = \\frac{1.2538536585}{1 + 1.2538536585} = \\frac{1.2538536585}{2.2538536585} \\approx 0.556317$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required, we obtain:\n$$p_{posterior} \\approx 0.5563$$\n\n### Part 2: Additively Separable Decision Algorithm\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for a principled way to weight each finding and their co-occurrence in a transparent, additively separable decision algorithm on the log-odds scale.\n\nThe fundamental relationship $O_{posterior} = LR \\times O_{prior}$ is multiplicative. A transparent, additively separable model can be constructed by transforming this relationship using the natural logarithm. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(O_{posterior}) = \\ln(LR) + \\ln(O_{prior})$$\nThis equation shows that the posterior log-odds is the sum of the prior log-odds and the natural logarithm of the likelihood ratio. The term $\\ln(LR)$ is often referred to as the \"weight of evidence\" provided by the test or finding. This forms the basis of the proposed algorithm.\n\nLet $l(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$ denote the log-odds (or logit) of a probability $p$. The update rule is:\n$$l(p_{posterior}) = l(p_{prior}) + \\text{weight of evidence}$$\nThe prior log-odds are calculated from the baseline prevalence $p_0=0.18$:\n$$l(p_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.18}{0.82}\\right)$$\nLet $x_1$ and $x_2$ be indicator variables such that $x_1=1$ if low CPR is present (and $0$ otherwise), and $x_2=1$ if oligohydramnios is present (and $0$ otherwise). We seek a model of the form:\n$$l(p_{posterior}) = l(p_0) + w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_{12} x_1 x_2$$\nwhere $w_1$ and $w_2$ are the weights for the individual findings, and $w_{12}$ is an interaction term that accounts for their non-independent co-occurrence.\n\nThe principled way to define these weights is to equate them with the log-likelihood ratios.\nIf only low CPR is present ($x_1=1, x_2=0$), the weight of evidence is $\\ln(LR_{CPR}^{+})$. Therefore, the weight for this finding is:\n$$w_1 = \\ln(LR_{CPR}^{+}) = \\ln(3.2)$$\nIf only oligohydramnios is present ($x_1=0, x_2=1$), the weight of evidence is $\\ln(LR_{oligo}^{+})$. Therefore, the weight for this finding is:\n$$w_2 = \\ln(LR_{oligo}^{+}) = \\ln(2.1)$$\nIf both findings are present ($x_1=1, x_2=1$), the total weight of evidence is the sum of the individual and interaction terms: $w_1 + w_2 + w_{12}$. This total weight must equal the log of the joint likelihood ratio, $\\ln(LR_{joint}^{+})$.\n$$w_1 + w_2 + w_{12} = \\ln(LR_{joint}^{+})$$\nWe are given that $LR_{joint}^{+} = k \\times LR_{CPR}^{+} \\times LR_{oligo}^{+}$. Therefore:\n$$\\ln(LR_{joint}^{+}) = \\ln(k \\times LR_{CPR}^{+} \\times LR_{oligo}^{+}) = \\ln(k) + \\ln(LR_{CPR}^{+}) + \\ln(LR_{oligo}^{+})$$\nSubstituting $w_1$ and $w_2$:\n$$\\ln(LR_{joint}^{+}) = \\ln(k) + w_1 + w_2$$\nBy comparing the two expressions for the total weight of evidence, we can identify the weight for the co-occurrence (the interaction term):\n$$w_{12} = \\ln(k) = \\ln(0.85)$$\nSince $k=0.85  1$, the interaction weight $w_{12}$ is negative. This correctly models the antagonistic interaction (or redundancy) between the findings, where their combined diagnostic value is less than what would be predicted if they were independent. If they were independent, $k$ would be $1$ and $\\ln(k)$ would be $0$.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is thus a logistic model:\n$$l(p_{posterior}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_0}{1-p_0}\\right) + \\ln(LR_{CPR}^{+})x_1 + \\ln(LR_{oligo}^{+})x_2 + \\ln(k)x_1x_2$$\nThis model is principled because it is a direct consequence of Bayes' theorem on the log-odds scale. It is transparent, as each component of evidence (each finding and their interaction) contributes an explicit, additive term to the final log-odds of the outcome. The only assumption invoked is that the provided joint likelihood ratio $LR_{joint}^{+} = k \\times LR_{CPR}^{+} \\times LR_{oligo}^{+}$ is a valid approximation for the effect of co-occurrence, which was stated as a given in the problem.",
