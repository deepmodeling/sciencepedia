            "problem": "A hemodynamically stable patient at approximately $6$ weeks by last menstrual period presents with mild vaginal spotting and unilateral pelvic discomfort. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) shows no intrauterine gestational sac. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), defined as the glycoprotein hormone produced by trophoblastic tissue and used as a marker of trophoblastic activity, is $2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ at presentation. A repeat serum hCG at $48$ hours is $3000\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, yielding a $48$-hour hCG ratio of $r=\\frac{3000}{2500}=1.2$. The patient desires pregnancy continuation if viable, has no known medical comorbidities, and denies significant pain or syncope. Blood type is unknown, and there is minimal ongoing spotting.\n\nUsing the fundamental clinical facts that in early viable intrauterine pregnancy, serum hCG typically rises substantially over short intervals (with widely accepted lower bounds of approximately $35\\%$ increase over $48$ hours at low hCG concentrations) and that TVUS has a discriminatory threshold range around $1500$–$3500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ for visualizing an intrauterine gestational sac depending on equipment and operator, determine the most appropriate interpretation of ectopic pregnancy risk and outline immediate and short-interval follow-up steps grounded in pregnancy of unknown location (PUL) principles. Choose the single best option.\n\nA. Elevated risk for ectopic pregnancy; manage as pregnancy of unknown location. Immediate steps: assess hemodynamic stability and abdominal exam; provide ectopic precautions; obtain Rh status and administer Rho(D) immune globulin if Rh-negative with bleeding; avoid empiric methotrexate now; arrange repeat TVUS and serum hCG in $48$ hours; consider diagnostic uterine aspiration if the patient desires termination or if diagnosis remains uncertain after the next evaluation.\n\nB. Low risk for ectopic pregnancy; reassure and begin routine prenatal care with first-trimester ultrasound in $2$ weeks; serial hCG is unnecessary.\n\nC. High risk for ectopic pregnancy; administer methotrexate today solely because no intrauterine sac is seen at $2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ and the $48$-hour hCG ratio is $1.2$; no further imaging or laboratory follow-up is required.\n\nD. Moderate risk for ectopic pregnancy; defer reassessment for $7$ days with repeat serum hCG and TVUS at that time; advise bedrest and avoid uterine aspiration in all cases.\n\nE. High risk for ectopic pregnancy; perform immediate diagnostic uterine aspiration for all patients with PUL regardless of preferences; if chorionic villi are not identified, presume ectopic pregnancy and treat with methotrexate without additional serial hCG or imaging.",
            "solution": "Begin with the foundational clinical facts relevant to early pregnancy location and viability assessment:\n\n1. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) kinetics: In early viable intrauterine pregnancy at low hCG concentrations, serum hCG generally increases over short intervals. A widely accepted lower bound for a normal rise is approximately $35\\%$ over $48$ hours. Formalizing the ratio, let $r=\\frac{hCG_{48}}{hCG_{0}}$. For a minimal expected viable rise, $r \\gtrsim 1.35$.\n\n2. Ultrasound discriminatory threshold: With modern transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), the intrauterine gestational sac is typically visible once hCG surpasses a threshold generally between $1500$ and $3500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, with many centers using the higher end (for example, around $3500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$) to minimize misclassification. Absence of a sac below the upper discriminatory threshold is not diagnostic of ectopic pregnancy.\n\n3. Pregnancy of unknown location (PUL): When a pregnancy test is positive but no intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy is identified on TVUS, management relies on serial hCG measurements and repeat imaging in short intervals (typically $48$ hours), along with clinical assessment and ectopic precautions. Empiric methotrexate is avoided unless criteria strongly support ectopic pregnancy (e.g., definitive extrauterine gestation or persistently abnormal hCG dynamics above discriminatory levels without intrauterine findings) and the patient is an appropriate candidate.\n\nApply these principles to the case:\n\n- Compute the hCG ratio: $r=\\frac{3000}{2500}=1.2$, an increase of $20\\%$ over $48$ hours. This is below the approximate $35\\%$ minimal rise expected for a viable intrauterine pregnancy at low hCG values. Therefore, viability is doubtful, and the pattern raises concern for either a failing intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy. It does not, in isolation, confirm ectopic pregnancy.\n\n- Consider the ultrasound context: At $hCG=2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$, absence of an intrauterine sac increases concern but remains nondiagnostic because many practices use a higher discriminatory level near $3000$–$3500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. Thus, immediate definitive treatment for ectopic pregnancy (e.g., methotrexate) would be premature unless additional evidence emerges.\n\n- Management framework: Because the patient is stable, the correct approach is to treat this as PUL with elevated ectopic risk. Immediate steps should include hemodynamic assessment, counseling on ectopic precautions (return immediately for worsening pain, syncope, heavy bleeding), Rh typing and Rho(D) immune globulin for Rh-negative patients with bleeding, and arranging short-interval follow-up with repeat TVUS and serum hCG in $48$ hours. Diagnostic uterine aspiration may be considered if the patient desires termination or if ambiguity persists after serial assessments; identification of chorionic villi would confirm intrauterine pregnancy loss, while absence would increase suspicion for ectopic and guide further management.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Elevated risk for ectopic pregnancy; manage as pregnancy of unknown location. The reasoning aligns with the hCG rise of $20\\%$ ($r=1.2$), which is less than the expected $35\\%$ minimal viable rise, and the nondiagnostic absence of a sac at $2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$. The immediate steps appropriately include assessment of stability, ectopic precautions, Rh status with Rho(D) immune globulin when indicated, avoidance of empiric methotrexate at this juncture, and $48$-hour repeat TVUS and hCG. Diagnostic uterine aspiration is correctly framed as conditional based on patient preference or persistent diagnostic uncertainty. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Low risk for ectopic pregnancy; reassure and begin routine prenatal care, first-trimester ultrasound in $2$ weeks; serial hCG unnecessary. This contradicts the fundamental hCG kinetics because $r=1.2$ is below the expected $1.35$ threshold for viability, and no sac is identified near the lower-to-mid discriminatory range. It dismisses the elevated risk and omits PUL-standard serial follow-up. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. High risk for ectopic pregnancy; administer methotrexate immediately based solely on nonvisualization at $2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ and $r=1.2$; no further imaging or labs. Although risk is elevated, immediate methotrexate is not indicated without more definitive evidence (e.g., extrauterine gestation on TVUS or persistently abnormal hCG dynamics above the higher discriminatory threshold). Nonvisualization at $2500\\,\\mathrm{mIU/mL}$ is nondiagnostic, and omitting serial hCG and repeat imaging risks overtreatment and potential interruption of a desired or resolving pregnancy. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Moderate risk; wait $7$ days for repeat serum hCG and TVUS; advise bedrest and avoid uterine aspiration. Delaying reassessment to $7$ days is unsafe given the potential for ectopic progression; standard PUL management uses $48$-hour intervals to promptly detect rising risk. Bedrest is not evidence-based for PUL, and blanket avoidance of diagnostic aspiration ignores its appropriate use in selected cases. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nE. High risk; immediate diagnostic uterine aspiration for all; if villi absent, presume ectopic and treat with methotrexate without further testing. Universal aspiration disregards patient preferences and clinical context. Moreover, presuming ectopic solely on absent villi without serial hCG or repeat imaging can be misleading due to sampling limitations; best practice requires correlation with hCG trajectories and imaging before methotrexate. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is option A, which correctly classifies the elevated ectopic risk and outlines immediate and short-interval follow-up steps consistent with PUL management principles and the underlying hCG kinetics and TVUS discriminatory thresholds.",

The pre-test probability that a randomly selected PUL represents a viable intrauterine pregnancy is $0.40$, based on the center’s prior cohort data. The patient’s serum progesterone concentration measured at presentation is $24$ ng/mL, and the hCG ratio over $48$ hours is $1.75$ (a $75\\%$ rise).\n\nFor clinical classification, define a “positive” result for viability as follows:\n- Serum progesterone “positive” if $\\geq 20$ ng/mL.\n- hCG trend “positive” if the $48$-hour rise is $\\geq 66\\%$ (i.e., an hCG ratio $\\geq 1.66$).\n\nFrom an internally validated PUL dataset, the following operating characteristics are available for these “positive” test definitions with respect to the outcome “viable pregnancy”:\n- For serum progesterone $\\geq 20$ ng/mL: sensitivity for viability $= 0.85$; in nonviable pregnancies, the probability of a “positive” progesterone result $= 0.30$.\n- For hCG rise $\\geq 66\\%$: sensitivity for viability $= 0.72$; in nonviable pregnancies, the probability of a “positive” hCG rise $= 0.10$.\n\nAssume conditional independence of the two tests given the true viability status.

            "solution": "The analytical task is to compute the post-test probability of a viable pregnancy given two independent, positive diagnostic test results. This problem is solved using Bayes' theorem, a fundamental principle of probability theory for updating beliefs based on evidence.\n\nLet us define the events and probabilities based on the provided data.\nLet $V$ be the event that the pregnancy is viable.\nLet $N$ be the event that the pregnancy is nonviable. These two events are mutually exclusive and exhaustive, so $P(N) = 1 - P(V)$.\nLet $T_P^+$ be the event of a \"positive\" serum progesterone test, defined as a concentration $\\geq 20$ ng/mL.\nLet $T_H^+$ be the event of a \"positive\" hCG trend test, defined as a 48-hour hCG ratio $\\geq 1.66$.\nLet $E$ be the event that both tests are positive, i.e., $E = T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+$.\n\nThe problem provides the following pre-test (prior) probability:\n$$P(V) = 0.40$$\nFrom this, we can deduce the prior probability of a nonviable pregnancy:\n$$P(N) = 1 - P(V) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$$\n\nThe problem also provides the conditional probabilities (operating characteristics) for each test.\nFor the progesterone test ($T_P$):\nThe sensitivity is $P(T_P^+ | V) = 0.85$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T_P^+ | N) = 0.30$.\n\nFor the hCG trend test ($T_H$):\nThe sensitivity is $P(T_H^+ | V) = 0.72$.\nThe false positive rate is $P(T_H^+ | N) = 0.10$.\n\nThe patient's results (progesterone of $24$ ng/mL and hCG ratio of $1.75$) both meet the criteria for a positive result, so we are evaluating the probability of viability given the event $E$.\n\nWe are asked to compute the post-test (posterior) probability of viability, $P(V | E)$, which is $P(V | T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+)$. According to Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{P(E | V) P(V)}{P(E)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(E)$, is the total probability of the evidence, which is calculated using the law of total probability:\n$$P(E) = P(E | V) P(V) + P(E | N) P(N)$$\nSubstituting this into the Bayesian formula gives:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{P(E | V) P(V)}{P(E | V) P(V) + P(E | N) P(N)}$$\nThe key assumption stated in the problem is the conditional independence of the two tests given the viability status. This allows us to compute the joint conditional probabilities $P(E | V)$ and $P(E | N)$ as the product of the individual conditional probabilities:\n$$P(E | V) = P(T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+ | V) = P(T_P^+ | V) \\times P(T_H^+ | V)$$\n$$P(E | N) = P(T_P^+ \\cap T_H^+ | N) = P(T_P^+ | N) \\times P(T_H^+ | N)$$\nUsing the given values, we calculate these joint probabilities:\n$$P(E | V) = 0.85 \\times 0.72 = 0.612$$\n$$P(E | N) = 0.30 \\times 0.10 = 0.030$$\nNow, we substitute these values, along with the prior probabilities, into the full Bayesian equation:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{(0.612) \\times (0.40)}{(0.612) \\times (0.40) + (0.030) \\times (0.60)}$$\nWe proceed with the arithmetic calculation of the numerator and denominator.\nNumerator:\n$$0.612 \\times 0.40 = 0.2448$$\nDenominator:\n$$(0.612 \\times 0.40) + (0.030 \\times 0.60) = 0.2448 + 0.0180 = 0.2628$$\nThe final posterior probability is the ratio of these two values:\n$$P(V | E) = \\frac{0.2448}{0.2628}$$\n$$P(V | E) \\approx 0.931506849...$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by first calculating the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and its variance for each trial. Then, these are combined using the inverse-variance weighting method to find the pooled ARR. Finally, the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is calculated from the pooled ARR.\n\nLet $p_c$ be the risk in the control group and $p_i$ be the risk in the intervention group. The risk is calculated as the number of events divided by the sample size, $p = e/n$. The Absolute Risk Reduction is defined as $ARR = p_c - p_i$.\n\n**For Trial A:**\nThe risk in the control group is $p_{cA} = \\frac{e_{cA}}{n_{cA}} = \\frac{80}{400} = 0.2$.\nThe risk in the intervention group is $p_{iA} = \\frac{e_{iA}}{n_{iA}} = \\frac{60}{400} = 0.15$.\nThe absolute risk reduction for Trial A is $ARR_A = p_{cA} - p_{iA} = 0.2 - 0.15 = 0.05$.\n\n**For Trial B:**\nThe risk in the control group is $p_{cB} = \\frac{e_{cB}}{n_{cB}} = \\frac{72}{240} = 0.3$.\nThe risk in the intervention group is $p_{iB} = \\frac{e_{iB}}{n_{iB}} = \\frac{80}{320} = 0.25$.\nThe absolute risk reduction for Trial B is $ARR_B = p_{cB} - p_{iB} = 0.3 - 0.25 = 0.05$.\n\n**For Trial C:**\nThe risk in the control group is $p_{cC} = \\frac{e_{cC}}{n_{cC}} = \\frac{36}{360} = 0.1$.\nThe risk in the intervention group is $p_{iC} = \\frac{e_{iC}}{n_{iC}} = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05$.\nThe absolute risk reduction for Trial C is $ARR_C = p_{cC} - p_{iC} = 0.1 - 0.05 = 0.05$.\n\nThe fixed-effect inverse-variance model pools the individual effect sizes (in this case, the ARRs) by weighting each by the inverse of its variance. The weight for a study $j$ is $w_j = \\frac{1}{Var(ARR_j)}$. The pooled ARR is then given by:\n$$ARR_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{\\sum_{j} w_j \\cdot ARR_j}{\\sum_{j} w_j}$$\nThe variance of the ARR for a single study is the sum of the variances of the two independent proportions:\n$$Var(ARR_j) = Var(p_{cj}) + Var(p_{ij}) = \\frac{p_{cj}(1-p_{cj})}{n_{cj}} + \\frac{p_{ij}(1-p_{ij})}{n_{ij}}$$\n\nWe can calculate the variance and weight for each trial.\n\n**Variance and Weight for Trial A:**\n$Var(ARR_A) = \\frac{0.2(1-0.2)}{400} + \\frac{0.15(1-0.15)}{400} = \\frac{0.16}{400} + \\frac{0.1275}{400} = \\frac{0.2875}{400} = 0.00071875$.\n$w_A = \\frac{1}{0.00071875}$.\n\n**Variance and Weight for Trial B:**\n$Var(ARR_B) = \\frac{0.3(1-0.3)}{240} + \\frac{0.25(1-0.25)}{320} = \\frac{0.21}{240} + \\frac{0.1875}{320} = 0.000875 + 0.0005859375 = 0.0014609375$.\n$w_B = \\frac{1}{0.0014609375}$.\n\n**Variance and Weight for Trial C:**\n$Var(ARR_C) = \\frac{0.1(1-0.1)}{360} + \\frac{0.05(1-0.05)}{360} = \\frac{0.09}{360} + \\frac{0.0475}{360} = \\frac{0.1375}{360} \\approx 0.00038194$.\n$w_C = \\frac{1}{0.1375/360} = \\frac{360}{0.1375}$.\n\nIn this specific problem, the ARR is identical for all three trials: $ARR_A = ARR_B = ARR_C = 0.05$. Therefore, the pooled ARR is also $0.05$. We can show this formally:\nLet $ARR_{\\text{common}} = 0.05$. Then the numerator of the pooled ARR formula becomes:\n$$\\sum_{j} w_j \\cdot ARR_j = w_A \\cdot ARR_{\\text{common}} + w_B \\cdot ARR_{\\text{common}} + w_C \\cdot ARR_{\\text{common}} = ARR_{\\text{common}} (w_A + w_B + w_C)$$\nSubstituting this into the formula for $ARR_{\\text{pooled}}$:\n$$ARR_{\\text{pooled}} = \\frac{ARR_{\\text{common}} (w_A + w_B + w_C)}{w_A + w_B + w_C} = ARR_{\\text{common}}$$\nTherefore, the pooled absolute risk reduction is $ARR_{\\text{pooled}} = 0.05$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is the reciprocal of the pooled absolute risk reduction. It represents the average number of patients who need to be treated with the intervention to prevent one additional adverse outcome.\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR_{\\text{pooled}}}$$\nSubstituting the value of the pooled ARR:\n$$NNT = \\frac{1}{0.05} = 20$$\nThe calculated NNT is $20$. Since this is already an integer, no rounding is necessary. This result indicates that, on average, $20$ patients with early pregnancy loss must be treated with mifepristone plus misoprostol to prevent one unplanned surgical uterine evacuation, compared to treatment with misoprostol alone.",
