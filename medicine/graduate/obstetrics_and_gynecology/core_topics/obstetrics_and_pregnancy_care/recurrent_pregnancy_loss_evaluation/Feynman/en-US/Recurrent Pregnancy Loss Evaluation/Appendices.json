            "introduction": "Evaluating recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) requires a holistic approach, integrating findings from multiple diagnostic domains—such as anatomical, genetic, and endocrine assessments. This exercise models the synthesis of disparate data into a conclusive picture. Consider the distinct eigenspaces as different categories of test results; only by assembling a complete set of information can we determine a key systemic property, analogous to reaching a final diagnosis or risk profile .",

            "problem": "In linear algebra, the **eigenvectors** of a square matrix $A$ are the non-zero vectors $v$ that, after being multiplied by $A$, remain parallel to the original vector, changing only in scale. This relationship is expressed by the equation $Av = \\lambda v$, where $\\lambda$ is a scalar known as the **eigenvalue** corresponding to the eigenvector $v$.\n\nFor a given eigenvalue $\\lambda$, the set of all eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda$, together with the zero vector, forms a subspace called the **eigenspace** of $\\lambda$. The dimension of this eigenspace is called the **geometric multiplicity** of the eigenvalue. The number of times an eigenvalue appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix is its **algebraic multiplicity**.\n\nA key property of an $n \\times n$ matrix is its **trace**, denoted $\\text{Tr}(A)$, which is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal. A fundamental theorem states that the trace of a matrix is also equal to the sum of its eigenvalues, counted with their algebraic multiplicities.\n\nA matrix is **diagonalizable** if the sum of the geometric multiplicities of all its distinct eigenvalues is equal to the dimension of the matrix. For a diagonalizable matrix, the algebraic multiplicity of each eigenvalue is equal to its geometric multiplicity.\n\nConsider a real $3 \\times 3$ matrix $A$. The matrix is known to have exactly two distinct eigenvalues, $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n- The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_1=4$ is spanned by the vectors $v_1 = (1, 0, 0)^T$ and $v_2 = (0, 1, 1)^T$.\n- The eigenspace corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_2=-1$ is spanned by the vector $v_3 = (0, 1, -1)^T$.\n\nBased on this information, derive the value of the trace of the matrix $A$.",
            "solution": "The trace of a matrix equals the sum of its eigenvalues with their algebraic multiplicities. Since A has two distinct eigenvalues and the sum of geometric multiplicities 2+1=3 equals its size, A is diagonalizable and each algebraic multiplicity equals the corresponding geometric multiplicity.\n\nThus the algebraic multiplicity of λ₁=4 is 2 and of λ₂=−1 is 1.\n\nHence\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(A)=2\\cdot 4 + 1\\cdot(-1)=8 - 1 = 7.\n$$",

            "introduction": "Clinical management in RPL often hinges on interpreting continuous variables like hormone levels or antibody titers, where we must decide how much variation is clinically acceptable. This practice explores the formal relationship between a deviation in a measurement and its effect on the system's stability, mirroring the challenge of setting clinical thresholds.
