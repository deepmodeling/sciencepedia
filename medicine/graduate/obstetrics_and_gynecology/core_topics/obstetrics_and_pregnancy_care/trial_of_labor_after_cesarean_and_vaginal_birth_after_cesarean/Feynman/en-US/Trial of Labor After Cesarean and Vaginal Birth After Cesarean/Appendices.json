Using only foundational definitions from clinical epidemiology—namely, that the absolute risk difference between two strategies is the difference in their risks, and that the number needed to harm is the minimal number of patients who would need to receive the harmful strategy instead of the comparator for one additional adverse event to occur on average—derive and compute the absolute risk difference attributable to choosing TOLAC rather than ERCS for uterine rupture, and the corresponding number needed to harm.\n\nRequirements for reporting:\n- Express the absolute risk difference as a decimal proportion (no percentage sign).\n- Define the number needed to harm as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the reciprocal of the absolute risk difference (use the ceiling convention).\n- Do not perform any rounding by significant figures beyond the ceiling operation for the number needed to harm.\n- Report your final result as an ordered pair $\\left(\\text{ARD}, \\text{NNH}\\right)$ in that order.

The clinical scenario (TOLAC vs. ERCS) and associated risk magnitudes for uterine rupture ($0.5\\%$ and $0.02\\%$) are plausible and consistent with data found in obstetrical literature.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary quantitative data and explicit definitions required for the calculation. The objectives are clearly stated, and the required output format is unambiguous. A unique solution exists.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It relies on standard, formal definitions from its field.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two epidemiological metrics: the Absolute Risk Difference (ARD) and the Number Needed to Harm (NNH).\n\nFirst, the risks provided as percentages are converted to decimal proportions for calculation.\nThe risk of uterine rupture for TOLAC is given as $R_{\\text{TOLAC}} = 0.5\\%$. As a decimal proportion, this is:\n$$R_{\\text{TOLAC}} = \\frac{0.5}{100} = 0.005$$\nThe risk of uterine rupture for ERCS is given as $R_{\\text{ERCS}} = 0.02\\%$. As a decimal proportion, this is:\n$$R_{\\text{ERCS}} = \\frac{0.02}{100} = 0.0002$$\n\nThe Absolute Risk Difference (ARD) is defined as the difference in risk between the two strategies. The problem specifies the ARD attributable to choosing TOLAC (the more harmful strategy in this context) rather than ERCS (the comparator). Therefore, the ARD is calculated as:\n$$ARD = R_{\\text{TOLAC}} - R_{\\text{ERCS}}$$\nSubstituting the decimal values:\n$$ARD = 0.005 - 0.0002 = 0.0048$$\nThis value represents the excess risk of uterine rupture incurred for each individual who undergoes TOLAC instead of ERCS.\n\nNext, the Number Needed to Harm (NNH) is calculated. The NNH represents the number of patients who would need to be treated with the more harmful intervention (TOLAC) for one additional adverse outcome (uterine rupture) to occur, on average, compared to the comparator intervention (ERCS). It is formally defined in the problem as the smallest integer greater than or equal to the reciprocal of the ARD. This is equivalent to applying the ceiling function to the reciprocal of the ARD.\n$$NNH = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{ARD} \\right\\rceil$$\nUsing the calculated value of ARD:\n$$NNH = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1}{0.0048} \\right\\rceil$$\nTo compute the value inside the ceiling function, we can express the decimal as a fraction:\n$$\\frac{1}{0.0048} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{48}{10000}} = \\frac{10000}{48}$$\nSimplifying the fraction:\n$$\\frac{10000}{48} = \\frac{5000}{24} = \\frac{2500}{12} = \\frac{1250}{6} = \\frac{625}{3}$$\nNow, we convert this fraction to a decimal to apply the ceiling function:\n$$\\frac{625}{3} = 208.333...$$\nApplying the ceiling function, which rounds up to the next integer:\n$$NNH = \\lceil 208.333... \\rceil = 209$$\nThis means that for every $209$ individuals who choose TOLAC over ERCS, one additional case of uterine rupture is expected to occur on average.\n\nThe final result is requested as an ordered pair $\\left(\\text{ARD}, \\text{NNH}\\right)$.\n$$(\\text{ARD}, \\text{NNH}) = (0.0048, 209)$$\nThe final result is reported as the requested ordered pair.",

            "problem": "In a tertiary obstetric unit, a predictive model is used at the initial evaluation of a Trial Of Labor After Cesarean (TOLAC) to estimate the probability of Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) success. The predictive model is a logistic regression whose fundamental base is that the log-odds of a binary outcome can be represented as a linear combination of clinically relevant predictors with fixed coefficients, and that probabilities are related to odds via the exponential and natural logarithm mappings. In this model, the log-odds of VBAC success is constructed from three predictors: prior vaginal birth, indication for the prior cesarean being nonrecurrent, and body mass index (BMI).

It presents a standard application of a logistic regression model, a fundamental tool in biostatistics and epidemiology, within a clinically realistic context in obstetrics.

The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the probability of Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) success, denoted as $p$, for a specific patient using a given logistic regression model. The foundational principle of a logistic regression model is that the natural logarithm of the odds of the outcome (the log-odds or logit) is a linear function of the predictor variables.\n\nLet the predictor variables be:\n$x_1$: prior vaginal birth, where $x_1=1$ for yes.\n$x_2$: nonrecurrent indication for the prior cesarean, where $x_2=1$ for yes.\n$x_3$: Body Mass Index (BMI).\n\nThe corresponding coefficients for these predictors and the intercept are given as:\n$\\beta_0 = -0.5$ (intercept)\n$\\beta_1 = 1.2$ (coefficient for prior vaginal birth)\n$\\beta_2 = 0.8$ (coefficient for nonrecurrent indication)\n$\\beta_3 = -0.05$ (coefficient for BMI)\n\nThe log-odds of VBAC success, which we denote as $\\eta$, is given by the linear combination:\n$$ \\eta = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\beta_3 x_3 $$\n\nThe patient's characteristics are provided as:\n$x_1 = 1$\n$x_2 = 1$\n$x_3 = 32$\n\nSubstituting these values into the linear model, we compute the log-odds for this patient:\n$$ \\eta = -0.5 + (1.2 \\times 1) + (0.8 \\times 1) + (-0.05 \\times 32) $$\nFirst, we calculate the contribution from the BMI term:\n$$ -0.05 \\times 32 = -\\frac{5}{100} \\times 32 = -\\frac{1}{20} \\times 32 = -\\frac{32}{20} = -\\frac{8}{5} = -1.6 $$\nNow, we substitute this back into the equation for $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = -0.5 + 1.2 + 0.8 - 1.6 $$\n$$ \\eta = 2.0 - 0.5 - 1.6 $$\n$$ \\eta = 1.5 - 1.6 $$\n$$ \\eta = -0.1 $$\n\nThe log-odds, $\\eta$, is defined as the natural logarithm of the odds of success. The odds are defined as the ratio of the probability of success, $p$, to the probability of failure, $1-p$.\n$$ \\eta = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) $$\nTo find the probability $p$, we must invert this relationship.

The TOLAC strategy has two mutually exclusive outcomes: a successful Vaginal Birth After Cesarean (VBAC) or a failed TOLAC resulting in an emergency repeat cesarean section.\n\nLet $E[U_{TOLAC}]$ be the expected utility of the TOLAC strategy. Let $U_S$ be the utility of a successful VBAC and $U_F$ be the utility of a failed TOLAC. Let $p_S$ be the probability of a successful VBAC.

The baseline utility for a $1$-year horizon with no morbidity is $1.0$ QALY. Disutility is measured as a decrement from this baseline. A disutility decrement is calculated as the product of the disutility magnitude and its duration in years. For probabilistic health events, the expected disutility decrement is used.\n\nFirst, we must convert all time durations into years, using the given conversion of $1$ year $= 52$ weeks.\n- Recovery from VBAC: $3$ weeks $= \\frac{3}{52}$ of a year.\n- Recovery from cesarean: $6$ weeks $= \\frac{6}{52}$ of a year.\n- PPH morbidity duration: $2$ weeks $= \\frac{2}{52}$ of a year.\n\nNext, we calculate the utility for each outcome branch.\n\n**1.
