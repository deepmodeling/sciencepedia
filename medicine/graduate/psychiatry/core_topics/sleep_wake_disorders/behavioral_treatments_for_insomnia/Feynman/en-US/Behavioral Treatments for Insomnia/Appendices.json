            "problem": "A clinician is implementing sleep restriction therapy within Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I). The weekly titration of prescribed time in bed is based on the consolidation of sleep as measured by Sleep Efficiency (SE), where by definition $SE = \\frac{\\text{total sleep time (TST)}}{\\text{time in bed (TIB)}}$. The control goal is to produce a negative feedback adjustment of $\\text{TIB}$ to stabilize $SE$ within a high-efficiency band while avoiding oscillations and preserving safety. The clinician chooses a fixed weekly step size of $\\Delta = 15$ minutes for changes to $\\text{TIB}$ and constrains $\\text{TIB}$ within $[300, 540]$ minutes to maintain safety and adherence. Using these base principles, derive a three-zone weekly decision rule that (i) increases $\\text{TIB}$ only when $SE$ is sufficiently high to tolerate expansion without materially lowering subsequent $SE$, (ii) decreases $\\text{TIB}$ when $SE$ is sufficiently low to indicate excessive wakefulness in bed, and (iii) holds $\\text{TIB}$ otherwise to prevent oscillatory overcorrection. Then apply the derived rule to the following case.\n\nA patient completes a baseline sleep diary yielding an average $\\text{TST}$ of $330$ minutes. The initial prescribed $\\text{TIB}$ for week $1$ is set equal to the baseline average $\\text{TST}$, clipped to the allowable range, that is, $\\text{TIB}_{1} = \\max\\{300, \\min\\{540, 330\\}\\}$.

Using your derived rule, determine the prescribed $\\text{TIB}$ for the start of week $7$. Express your final answer in minutes. No rounding is necessary.",
            "solution": "First, we must derive the three-zone weekly decision rule for titrating the prescribed Time in Bed ($\\text{TIB}$). The problem specifies that the rule must (i) increase $\\text{TIB}$ for high Sleep Efficiency ($\\text{SE}$), (ii) decrease $\\text{TIB}$ for low $\\text{SE}$, and (iii) hold $\\text{TIB}$ otherwise. This structure is intended to stabilize $\\text{SE}$ in a high-efficiency band.\n\nStandard clinical protocols for sleep restriction therapy define specific thresholds for \"high\" and \"low\" $\\text{SE}$. Grounded in established clinical practice, we will define a \"low\" threshold $SE_{low}$ and a \"high\" threshold $SE_{high}$. A common and effective choice for these thresholds, which creates the desired three-zone control system, is $SE_{low} = 0.85$ ($85\\%$) and $SE_{high} = 0.90$ ($90\\%$). Sleep efficiency below $85\\%$ indicates a need for sleep consolidation (less time in bed), while sleep efficiency above $90\\%$ suggests the patient can tolerate an expanded sleep window (more time in bed). The range between these values is the target stabilization band.\n\nLet $\\text{TIB}_{i}$ and $\\text{TST}_{i}$ be the time in bed and total sleep time for week $i$, respectively. The sleep efficiency for week $i$ is $SE_{i} = \\frac{\\text{TST}_{i}}{\\text{TIB}_{i}}$. The prescribed time in bed for the next week, $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}$, is determined based on $SE_{i}$. The fixed step size for adjustment is given as $\\Delta = 15$ minutes.\n\nThe derived three-zone decision rule is as follows:\n1.  If $SE_{i} \\ge 0.90$, then the tentative next week's time in bed is $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}' = \\text{TIB}_{i} + \\Delta$.\n2.  If $SE_{i} < 0.85$, then $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}' = \\text{TIB}_{i} - \\Delta$.\n3.  If $0.85 \\le SE_{i} < 0.90$, then $\\text{TIB}_{i+1}' = \\text{TIB}_{i}$.\n\nThe problem also specifies a safety and adherence constraint on $\\text{TIB}$, which must be within the range $[300, 540]$ minutes. Therefore, the final prescribed $\\text{TIB}$ for week $i+1$ is obtained by clipping the tentative value to this range:\n$\\text{TIB}_{i+1} = \\max\\{300, \\min\\{540, \\text{TIB}_{i+1}'\\}\\}$.\n\nNow, we apply this rule to the provided case data to determine $\\text{TIB}_{7}$.\n\nThe initial average $\\text{TST}$ is $330$ minutes.

The initial sleep window was set at $6$ hours (from $00:00$ to $06:00$) based on baseline sleep logs. After $1$ week, the patient reports a near-miss motor vehicle incident due to drowsy driving, spontaneous microsleeps during sedentary tasks, an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score of $16$, new pressured speech, increased goal-directed activity, irritability, and emergence of suicidal ideation without a plan. The patient’s clinician must determine immediate protective actions within the framework of CBT-I.\n\nUse the following foundational base to reason about safety and treatment modifications:\n- The two-process model of sleep regulation posits a homeostatic sleep drive (Process $S$) that rises with sustained wakefulness and dissipates during sleep, and a circadian process (Process $C$) that modulates sleep propensity across the $24$-hour day. Sleep restriction increases Process $S$ to consolidate sleep but also increases daytime sleepiness when applied too aggressively.\n- Sleep efficiency is defined as $SE = \\frac{TST}{TIB}$, where $TST$ is total sleep time and $TIB$ is time in bed. In CBT-I, time in bed is titrated to improve $SE$ by balancing Process $S$ and Process $C$ while maintaining safety.\n- Well-tested clinical facts: excessive daytime sleepiness increases accident risk; sleep loss can precipitate hypomania or mania in vulnerable individuals; emerging suicidality requires immediate safety planning; evening caffeine and indiscriminate bright-light exposure can exacerbate insomnia and mood destabilization; obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be unmasked or worsened by sleep restriction.\n\nWhich of the following are appropriate immediate protective actions?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The patient is experiencing a clinical crisis with three life-threatening components: 1) a dangerous level of sleepiness (ESS of 16, microsleeps, near-miss accident), 2) destabilization of Bipolar Disorder into a potential (hypo)manic episode (pressured speech, increased goal-directed activity, irritability), and 3) emergence of suicidal ideation. The primary cause appears to be the aggressive sleep restriction ($6$-hour sleep window), which is a known risk in patients with Bipolar Disorder. The immediate priority is to ensure safety by modifying the treatment plan.\n\nLet's analyze each option based on the provided clinical facts:\n\n**A. Temporarily suspend sleep restriction and expand time in bed by $30$–$60$ minutes, enforce no driving until sleepiness resolves, and perform urgent suicide and mania risk evaluation, coordinating with the pharmacotherapy prescriber.**\nThis is a comprehensive and correct response. Expanding time in bed directly addresses the excessive sleepiness and a primary trigger for the mood episode. Enforcing no driving is a critical safety measure. Urgent psychiatric evaluation and coordination with the prescriber are standard of care for new-onset suicidality and mania. **This action is appropriate.**\n\n**B. Continue sleep restriction unchanged but add a $30$ minute afternoon nap to reduce sleepiness.**\nThis is incorrect and unsafe. Continuing the likely driver of the crisis (sleep restriction) is dangerous. A nap is an insufficient countermeasure for this level of sleep debt and does not address the mood destabilization.\n\n**C. Initiate high-intensity morning bright-light therapy ($10\\,000$ lux for $60$ minutes) to counter sleepiness despite concerns of mood destabilization.**\nThis is incorrect and risky. While bright light has alerting properties, it is a known potential precipitant of mania in vulnerable individuals. Introducing it during an emerging manic episode is contraindicated.\n\n**D. Screen for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with expedited diagnostic testing before resuming restriction; consider interim use of a fixed earlier bedtime with the same fixed wake time to increase $TIB$ and improve safety while evaluation proceeds.**\nThis is a prudent and correct action. The patient's severe sleepiness warrants ruling out an underlying sleep disorder like OSA, which can be unmasked by sleep restriction. The interim plan to increase Time in Bed ($TIB$) by adjusting the bedtime is a specific, safe way to implement the strategy from option A while awaiting further diagnostics. **This action is appropriate.**\n\n**E. Instruct the patient to increase evening caffeine intake to maintain wakefulness and preserve the sleep window; provide reassurance that mood symptoms will normalize as sleep consolidates.**\nThis is incorrect and harmful. Evening caffeine would further disrupt sleep and could worsen agitation. Offering simple reassurance in the face of a psychiatric emergency is negligent.\n\n**F. Implement a written safety plan including crisis resources, increase visit frequency or provide daily check-ins, and collaborate with family to restrict access to lethal means; document and monitor for warning signs.**\nThis is a mandatory and correct response. The emergence of suicidal ideation requires immediate and specific safety planning, including means restriction and increased monitoring, as a core component of risk management. **This action is appropriate.**\n\nIn summary, the appropriate immediate protective actions are those described in options A, D, and F.",
