            "problem": "A 34-year-old sales representative presents for evaluation of his alcohol use. Over the past 12 months, he has drunk alcohol at home on most weeknights. He often plans to have 1–2 drinks but finds himself finishing 6–7 and staying up later than intended. Since January, he has made multiple attempts to restrict drinking to weekends and to limit to 2 drinks, but each attempt has lasted less than 2 weeks before returning to prior patterns. He reports strong urges to drink in the late afternoon near the end of the workday. One month ago, after a work dinner, he drove himself home after consuming approximately 5 drinks. In the past 3 months, he has missed two early-morning client meetings due to oversleeping after drinking and received a written warning from his supervisor. His partner has complained repeatedly over the past 6 months that his drinking is causing arguments and tension at home, but he has continued to drink. Compared with two years ago, he now requires 5–6 drinks to achieve the same buzz that 2–3 drinks previously produced. He denies tremor, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, or other withdrawal symptoms in the past 12 months; he recalls morning shakiness if he skipped drinking about 18 months ago. He buys alcohol during routine grocery trips, keeps it at home, and typically drinks for about 45 minutes on evenings when he drinks; aside from the two missed mornings, he denies spending a great deal of time recovering from alcohol’s effects. He continues his weekly recreational soccer league. Liver enzymes were mildly elevated 14 months ago but have been normal on checks over the past year. He received an open-container citation 6 years ago.\n\nBased strictly on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) framework applied to the past 12 months, how many Alcohol Use Disorder criteria are met, and what is the appropriate DSM-5 severity classification?\n\nA. 2 criteria; mild\n\nB. 4 criteria; moderate\n\nC. 7 criteria; severe\n\nD. 9 criteria; severe",
            "solution": "The problem statement will be validated by first extracting the provided data and then assessing its scientific grounding, consistency, and clarity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe clinical vignette provides the following information about a 34-year-old male, with the evaluation focused on the past 12 months:\n- **Intended vs. Actual Use:** Often plans to have 1–2 drinks but consumes 6–7.\n- **Period of Use:** Drinks alcohol on most weeknights and stays up later than intended.\n- **Control over Use:** Since January (within the last 12 months), multiple unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use, each lasting less than 2 weeks.\n- **Cravings:** Reports strong urges to drink in the late afternoon.\n- **Hazardous Use:** Drove home one month ago after consuming approximately 5 drinks.\n- **Role Obligations:** In the past 3 months, missed two work meetings due to oversleeping after drinking, resulting in a written warning.\n- **Social/Interpersonal Problems:** Continued drinking despite his partner's repeated complaints over the past 6 months that it causes arguments and tension.\n- **Tolerance:** Requires 5–6 drinks to achieve an effect previously produced by 2–3 drinks.\n- **Withdrawal:** Explicitly denies any withdrawal symptoms (tremor, insomnia, nausea, anxiety) in the past 12 months. A past episode of shakiness occurred 18 months ago, which is outside the specified timeframe.\n- **Time Spent:** Buys alcohol during routine trips, drinks for about 45 minutes per session, and denies spending a great deal of time recovering from its effects (apart from the two missed meetings).\n- **Activities:** Continues his weekly recreational soccer league; no evidence of giving up important activities.\n- **Prior History (outside 12-month window):** Mildly elevated liver enzymes 14 months ago (normal in the past year), open-container citation 6 years ago.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\nThe problem asks for a diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) based on the criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), applied to the past 12 months.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly grounded in clinical psychiatry. The DSM-5 is the authoritative guide for diagnosing mental disorders in the United States and many other parts of the world. The scenario is a realistic clinical presentation of AUD.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a detailed case history and asks for a specific classification (number of criteria and severity) based on a clearly defined, formal system (DSM-5) and a specified time-frame (past 12 months). The information is sufficient to arrive at a unique, evidence-based conclusion.\n- **Objective:** The problem is presented as an objective case vignette. It avoids subjective or opinion-based language and asks for the application of a standardized diagnostic framework.\n\nThe problem statement has no scientific or factual unsoundness, is not incomplete or contradictory, is not unrealistic, and is well-structured.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by systematically applying the DSM-5 criteria.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe DSM-5 defines Alcohol Use Disorder by a set of 11 criteria. The diagnosis requires at least 2 criteria to be met within a 12-month period. The severity is graded as follows:\n- **Mild:** 2–3 criteria met.\n- **Moderate:** 4–5 criteria met.\n- **Severe:** 6 or more criteria met.\n\nWe will evaluate each of the 11 criteria based on the provided case information for the past 12 months.\n\n1.  **Alcohol taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than intended:** The patient \"often plans to have 1–2 drinks but finds himself finishing 6–7 and staying up later than intended.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n2.  **Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use:** The patient \"has made multiple attempts to restrict drinking...but each attempt has lasted less than 2 weeks before returning to prior patterns.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n3.  **A great deal of time is spent in activities to obtain, use, or recover from alcohol:** The text states, \"He buys alcohol during routine grocery trips...and typically drinks for about 45 minutes on evenings when he drinks\". It also explicitly notes he \"denies spending a great deal of time recovering from alcohol’s effects.\" The evidence provided argues against meeting this criterion. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n4.  **Craving, or a strong desire or urge to use alcohol:** The patient \"reports strong urges to drink in the late afternoon near the end of the workday.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n5.  **Recurrent use resulting in a failure to fulfill major role obligations:** The patient \"has missed two early-morning client meetings due to oversleeping after drinking and received a written warning from his supervisor.\" This represents a clear failure in a major work role obligation. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n6.  **Continued use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems:** The patient’s \"partner has complained repeatedly over the past 6 months that his drinking is causing arguments and tension at home, but he has continued to drink.\" This criterion is **MET**.\n\n7.  **Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced:** The patient \"continues his weekly recreational soccer league.\" No evidence is provided that any activities have been given up or reduced. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n8.  **Recurrent use in situations in which it is physically hazardous:** The patient \"drove himself home after consuming approximately 5 drinks.\" Driving while intoxicated is a classic example of physically hazardous use. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n9.  **Continued use despite knowledge of having a persistent physical or psychological problem caused or exacerbated by alcohol:** Liver enzymes were normal in the past year, so there is no known, persistent physical problem. The interpersonal problems are accounted for by criterion 6. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n10. **Tolerance:** The patient \"now requires 5–6 drinks to achieve the same buzz that 2–3 drinks previously produced.\" This is the definition of tolerance. This criterion is **MET**.\n\n11. **Withdrawal:** The patient \"denies tremor, insomnia, nausea, anxiety, or other withdrawal symptoms in the past 12 months.\" The episode of shakiness was 18 months ago and is outside the diagnostic window. This criterion is **NOT MET**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- Criteria met: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10.\n- Total number of criteria met: 7.\n- Since 7 is greater than or equal to 6, the DSM-5 severity classification is **Severe**.\n\nThe correct diagnosis is Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, with 7 criteria met.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. 2 criteria; mild:** This is incorrect. The patient meets 7 criteria, not 2. While meeting 2 criteria would correspond to a mild severity, the initial count is wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. 4 criteria; moderate:** This is incorrect. The patient meets 7 criteria, not 4. While meeting 4 criteria would correspond to a moderate severity, the initial count is wrong. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. 7 criteria; severe:** This is correct. Our analysis confirms that the patient meets exactly 7 of the DSM-5 criteria. A count of 7 falls into the \"severe\" category (6 or more criteria). **Correct**.\n\n*   **D. 9 criteria; severe:** This is incorrect. A strict application of the DSM-5 criteria to the vignette yields a count of 7. To reach a count of 9, one would have to incorrectly affirm criteria #3 (time spent), #7 (activities given up), #9 (use despite problem), or #11 (withdrawal), for which there is insufficient or contradictory evidence. **Incorrect**.",

            "problem": "A prospective cohort study investigates a neurobiological predictor of stimulant use disorder in young adults. At baseline, all participants are free of stimulant use disorder as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Each participant undergoes positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify striatal dopamine $D_2/D_3$ receptor availability. Exposure is defined as low striatal $D_2/D_3$ receptor availability (below the cohort’s $25^{\\text{th}}$ percentile) versus normal/higher availability. Participants are then followed for $3$ years to ascertain incident stimulant use disorder.\n\nThe data are summarized in a $2 \\times 2$ table of counts:\n- Exposed (low striatal $D_2/D_3$ availability): $84$ developed stimulant use disorder and $196$ did not ($n = 280$).\n- Unexposed (normal/higher striatal $D_2/D_3$ availability): $78$ developed stimulant use disorder and $442$ did not ($n = 520$).\n\nUsing first principles from epidemiology and probability, compute the relative risk ($RR$), the odds ratio ($OR$), and the risk difference ($RD$) for stimulant use disorder comparing exposed versus unexposed. Round your numerical answers to four significant figures. Express $RD$ as a decimal proportion. These metrics are dimensionless; do not include units. Finally, explain the direction and magnitude of the association using absolute and relative metrics grounded in their definitions.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of neurobiology and epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. The problem requires the calculation and interpretation of standard epidemiological measures of association from data provided in a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table format derived from a prospective cohort study.\n\nLet us define the events and variables. The outcome is the development of stimulant use disorder, denoted by $D$. The absence of the outcome is denoted by $\\bar{D}$. The exposure is low striatal dopamine $D_2/D_3$ receptor availability, denoted by $E$. The unexposed condition is normal/higher availability, denoted by $\\bar{E}$.\n\nThe provided data can be organized into a $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where the cells represent counts of individuals:\n- $a$: Number of exposed individuals who developed the disorder.\n- $b$: Number of exposed individuals who did not develop the disorder.\n- $c$: Number of unexposed individuals who developed the disorder.\n- $d$: Number of unexposed individuals who did not develop the disorder.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n- $a = 84$\n- $b = 196$\n- $c = 78$\n- $d = 442$\n\nWe can tabulate these values and calculate the marginal totals:\n- Total number of exposed individuals: $N_E = a + b = 84 + 196 = 280$.\n- Total number of unexposed individuals: $N_{\\bar{E}} = c + d = 78 + 442 = 520$.\n- Total number of individuals who developed the disorder: $N_D = a + c = 84 + 78 = 162$.\n- Total number of individuals who did not develop the disorder: $N_{\\bar{D}} = b + d = 196 + 442 = 638$.\n- Total number of participants in the study: $N = a + b + c + d = 280 + 520 = 800$.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by calculating the three requested epidemiological metrics from these first principles.\n\n1.  **Risk and Relative Risk ($RR$)**\n    The risk, or cumulative incidence, is the probability of developing the outcome over the specified follow-up period.\n    The risk in the exposed group ($R_E$) is the proportion of exposed individuals who develop the disorder:\n    $$R_E = P(D|E) = \\frac{a}{a+b} = \\frac{84}{280} = 0.3$$\n    The risk in the unexposed group ($R_{\\bar{E}}$) is the proportion of unexposed individuals who develop the disorder:\n    $$R_{\\bar{E}} = P(D|\\bar{E}) = \\frac{c}{c+d} = \\frac{78}{520} = 0.15$$\n    The relative risk ($RR$) is the ratio of the risk in the exposed group to the risk in the unexposed group:\n    $$RR = \\frac{R_E}{R_{\\bar{E}}} = \\frac{0.3}{0.15} = 2.0$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, the relative risk is $2.000$.\n\n2.  **Odds and Odds Ratio ($OR$)**\n    The odds of an event is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring to the probability of it not occurring.\n    The odds of developing the disorder in the exposed group ($O_E$) is:\n    $$O_E = \\frac{P(D|E)}{P(\\bar{D}|E)} = \\frac{a/(a+b)}{b/(a+b)} = \\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{84}{196}$$\n    The odds of developing the disorder in the unexposed group ($O_{\\bar{E}}$) is:\n    $$O_{\\bar{E}} = \\frac{P(D|\\bar{E})}{P(\\bar{D}|\\bar{E})} = \\frac{c/(c+d)}{d/(c+d)} = \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{78}{442}$$\n    The odds ratio ($OR$) is the ratio of the odds in the exposed group to the odds in the unexposed group. It can also be calculated as the cross-product ratio from the $2 \\times 2$ table:\n    $$OR = \\frac{O_E}{O_{\\bar{E}}} = \\frac{a/b}{c/d} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{84 \\times 442}{196 \\times 78} = \\frac{37128}{15288} \\approx 2.4285714$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, the odds ratio is $2.429$.\n\n3.  **Risk Difference ($RD$)**\n    The risk difference ($RD$), also known as the attributable risk, is the absolute difference in risk between the exposed and unexposed groups.\n    $$RD = R_E - R_{\\bar{E}} = \\frac{a}{a+b} - \\frac{c}{c+d} = 0.3 - 0.15 = 0.15$$\n    As a decimal proportion rounded to four significant figures, the risk difference is $0.1500$.\n\n4.  **Interpretation of the Association**\n    The direction of the association is determined by whether the metrics are greater than, less than, or equal to the null value (which is $1$ for $RR$ and $OR$, and $0$ for $RD$).\n    - $RR = 2.000 > 1$\n    - $OR = 2.429 > 1$\n    - $RD = 0.1500 > 0$\n    All three measures consistently indicate a positive association, meaning that low striatal $D_2/D_3$ receptor availability is a risk factor for developing stimulant use disorder.\n\n    The magnitude of the association is interpreted using both relative and absolute measures:\n    - **Relative Magnitude ($RR$ and $OR$):** The relative risk ($RR = 2.000$) indicates that individuals with low striatal $D_2/D_3$ availability were $2$ times as likely to develop stimulant use disorder over the $3$-year period compared to those with normal/higher availability. The odds ratio ($OR = 2.429$) indicates that the odds of developing the disorder were approximately $2.43$ times higher in the exposed group. The $OR$ is further from the null value of $1$ than the $RR$, which is mathematically expected when the outcome is not rare and the association is positive ($RR > 1$).\n    - **Absolute Magnitude ($RD$):** The risk difference ($RD = 0.1500$) provides an absolute measure of the exposure's impact. It signifies an excess risk of $0.15$, or $15$ percentage points, attributable to low $D_2/D_3$ availability. This means that for every $100$ individuals with low $D_2/D_3$ availability, there were $15$ additional cases of stimulant use disorder observed over $3$ years than would have occurred in a group of $100$ individuals with normal/higher $D_2/D_3$ availability. This metric is often more useful for public health and clinical decision-making as it quantifies the absolute excess burden of disease associated with the exposure.\n\nIn summary, the neurobiological predictor demonstrates a statistically and epidemiologically meaningful association with the future development of stimulant use disorder, with a twofold increase in relative risk and a $15\\%$ absolute increase in risk.",

            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a problem in neuroreceptor pharmacology, specifically concerning the effect of an acute dopamine challenge on the Binding Potential ($BP_{ND}$) of a PET radioligand. I will first validate the problem statement and then proceed to a full derivation and solution if it is valid.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   A single receptor population of dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) undergoes competitive binding between endogenous dopamine ($DA$) and a reversible radioligand ($RL$).\n-   The system is at equilibrium.\n-   Receptor occupancy for a single ligand: $\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{[L] + K_{d}}$.\n-   Extracellular dopamine concentration at baseline: $[DA]_{0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   Extracellular dopamine concentration post-stimulant: $[DA]_{1} = 60\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   Equilibrium dissociation constant of dopamine at D2R: $K_{d}^{DA} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n-   The radioligand is administered at tracer doses: $\\frac{[RL]}{K_{d}^{RL}} \\ll 1$, where $[RL]$ is the radioligand concentration and $K_{d}^{RL}$ is its equilibrium dissociation constant at D2R.\n-   Definition of Binding Potential: $BP_{ND}$ equals \"the product of the non-displaceable free fraction ($f_{ND}$) and the ratio of available receptor density ($B_{avail}$) to the apparent dissociation constant under competitive conditions ($K_{d}^{app}$)\".\n-   The following are assumed constant during the experiment: non-displaceable free fraction ($f_{ND}$), total receptor density ($B_{max}$), and the radioligand's dissociation constant ($K_{d}^{RL}$).\n-   The required calculation is the fractional change in binding potential, $\\Delta = \\frac{BP_{ND,1} - BP_{ND,0}}{BP_{ND,0}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of receptor pharmacology and quantitative PET imaging. The concepts of competitive binding, equilibrium dissociation constants, receptor occupancy, tracer conditions, and Binding Potential ($BP_{ND}$) are all standard and fundamental to the field. The provided scenario—an amphetamine challenge increasing synaptic dopamine and causing displacement of a D2R radioligand—is a classic experimental paradigm in human neuroimaging. The numerical values for dopamine concentrations and the dissociation constant are within a plausible physiological range.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and relationships to derive the required quantity. It asks for a specific, computable value ($\\Delta$). The assumptions (equilibrium, competitive binding, tracer dose) are clearly stated and sufficient to construct a solvable model.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise, technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem's definition of $BP_{ND}$ is dense but consistent with standard models in the literature. It can be formalized as $BP_{ND} = f_{ND} \\frac{B_{avail}}{K_{d,app}^{RL}}$. Interpreting \"available receptor density\" as the total receptor density, $B_{avail} = B_{max}$, and the \"apparent dissociation constant\" as $K_{d,app}^{RL} = K_{d}^{RL}(1 + [DA]/K_{d}^{DA})$, which incorporates the competitive effect of dopamine, this definition leads directly to the standard formula for $BP_{ND}$ under endogenous competition. This interpretation is consistent and makes the problem solvable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe first step is to derive the mathematical relationship between the Binding Potential ($BP_{ND}$) and the extracellular dopamine concentration ($[DA]$) based on the principles of competitive equilibrium binding.\n\nLet $[R]$ be the concentration of free D2 receptors, $[R-DA]$ be the concentration of receptors bound to dopamine, and $[R-RL]$ be the concentration of receptors bound to the radioligand. The total receptor concentration, $B_{max}$, is the sum of all receptor states:\n$$B_{max} = [R] + [R-DA] + [R-RL]$$\n\nAt equilibrium, the binding processes are described by their respective dissociation constants:\n$$K_{d}^{DA} = \\frac{[R][DA]}{[R-DA]} \\implies [R-DA] = \\frac{[R][DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}}$$\n$$K_{d}^{RL} = \\frac{[R][RL]}{[R-RL]} \\implies [R-RL] = \\frac{[R][RL]}{K_{d}^{RL}}$$\n\nSubstitute these into the mass balance equation for $B_{max}$:\n$$B_{max} = [R] + \\frac{[R][DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}} + \\frac{[R][RL]}{K_{d}^{RL}} = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}} + \\frac{[RL]}{K_{d}^{RL}} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the radioligand is at tracer doses, which implies that the fraction of receptors occupied by the radioligand is very small. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{[RL]}{K_{d}^{RL}} \\ll 1$. This allows us to neglect this term in the parentheses relative to the other terms:\n$$B_{max} \\approx [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}} \\right)$$\n\nFrom this, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as a function of $[DA]$:\n$$[R] \\approx \\frac{B_{max}}{1 + \\frac{[DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}}}$$\n\nThe Binding Potential, $BP_{ND}$, is operationally defined in PET as the ratio of the specifically bound radioligand concentration, $[R-RL]$, to the concentration of free (or non-displaceable) radioligand in the tissue. For this problem, a common and equivalent formulation is $BP_{ND} = \\frac{[R-RL]}{f_{ND}[RL]_{free-in-plasma}}$, but a more direct derivation arises from its relationship to tissue compartments. A standard expression for $BP_{ND}$ under competitive conditions, consistent with the problem statement's definition, is:\n$$BP_{ND} = \\frac{f_{ND} B_{max}}{K_{d}^{RL} \\left( 1 + \\frac{[DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}} \\right)}$$\nThis equation shows the explicit dependence of $BP_{ND}$ on $[DA]$. We can group the constant terms into a single constant $C$, since $f_{ND}$, $B_{max}$, and $K_{d}^{RL}$ are unchanged by the dopamine challenge:\n$$C = \\frac{f_{ND} B_{max}}{K_{d}^{RL}}$$\nSo, the relationship is simplified to:\n$$BP_{ND}([DA]) = \\frac{C}{1 + \\frac{[DA]}{K_{d}^{DA}}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNow, we compute the fractional change $\\Delta$. We have the binding potential at baseline ($BP_{ND,0}$) with dopamine concentration $[DA]_{0}$, and after the stimulant challenge ($BP_{ND,1}$) with dopamine concentration $[DA]_{1}$.\n$$BP_{ND,0} = \\frac{C}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{0}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}$$\n$$BP_{ND,1} = \\frac{C}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{1}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}$$\n\nThe fractional change $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{BP_{ND,1} - BP_{ND,0}}{BP_{ND,0}} = \\frac{BP_{ND,1}}{BP_{ND,0}} - 1$$\n\nTo find the ratio $\\frac{BP_{ND,1}}{BP_{ND,0}}$:\n$$\\frac{BP_{ND,1}}{BP_{ND,0}} = \\frac{\\frac{C}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{1}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}}{\\frac{C}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{0}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{0}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{1}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}$$\nThe constant $C$ cancels, as expected. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{0}}{K_{d}^{DA}}}{1 + \\frac{[DA]_{1}}{K_{d}^{DA}}} \\right) - 1$$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$[DA]_{0} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$[DA]_{1} = 60\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{d}^{DA} = 150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nFirst, compute the dimensionless ratios:\n$$\\frac{[DA]_{0}}{K_{d}^{DA}} = \\frac{12}{150} = \\frac{4}{50} = 0.08$$\n$$\\frac{[DA]_{1}}{K_{d}^{DA}} = \\frac{60}{150} = \\frac{6}{15} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.40$$\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation for $\\Delta$:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{1 + 0.08}{1 + 0.40} - 1 = \\frac{1.08}{1.40} - 1$$\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{108}{140} - 1 = \\frac{27}{35} - 1$$\nCalculating the value of the fraction:\n$$\\frac{27}{35} \\approx 0.77142857...$$\nTherefore, the fractional change is:\n$$\\Delta \\approx 0.77142857 - 1 = -0.22857143...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\Delta \\approx -0.2286$$\nThe negative sign indicates a decrease in the binding potential, which is expected as the increased concentration of endogenous dopamine competes with and displaces the radioligand from the D2 receptors.",
