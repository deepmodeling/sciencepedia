This practice challenges you to move beyond simple qualitative descriptions by developing a quantitative index based on operant principles to rank avoidance patterns for clinical intervention. By systematically weighing factors like frequency, reinforcement magnitude, and functional impairment, you will hone the critical skill of data-driven treatment targeting, as demonstrated in this exercise .",

            "problem": "A patient with Major Depressive Disorder reports multiple recurring behaviors documented in an Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) log, with each entry including weekly frequency, antecedent aversiveness, immediate relief, enjoyment, and functional impairment cost. In operant terms, negative reinforcement refers to the increased probability of a behavior due to the removal or reduction of an aversive stimulus following that behavior. In Behavioral Activation, the Trigger-Response-Avoidance Pattern (TRAP) conceptualization identifies avoidance maintained by negative reinforcement, and Trigger-Response-Alternative Coping (TRAC) conversion aims to replace avoidance with alternative coping responses. \n\nYou are to derive, from first principles in operant conditioning, a mathematically principled scalar index for the likelihood that each behavior is primarily maintained by negative reinforcement and then a clinical priority index that incorporates functional impairment for prioritizing Trigger-Response-Alternative Coping (TRAC) conversion. Your derivation must satisfy the following monotonicity constraints consistent with the law of effect and the definition of negative reinforcement: the negative reinforcement likelihood for behavior $i$ must be strictly increasing in weekly frequency $f_i$, in the proportion of episodes preceded by aversive antecedents $p_i$, in antecedent aversiveness severity $a_i$, and in immediate relief magnitude $r_i$, and strictly decreasing in enjoyment $e_i$. Use only the variables provided and construct a dimensionless scalar likelihood that is well-defined for all nonnegative inputs. Then construct a clinical priority index that additionally increases with functional impairment cost $c_i$.\n\nThe ABC log contains the following behaviors and ratings:\n- Behavior $1$: Checking phone notifications repeatedly. $f_1 = 28$, $p_1 = 0.55$, $a_1 = 5.0$, $r_1 = 3.5$, $e_1 = 4.5$, $c_1 = 3.0$.\n- Behavior $2$: Avoiding email by closing inbox. $f_2 = 21$, $p_2 = 0.90$, $a_2 = 8.0$, $r_2 = 7.5$, $e_2 = 1.0$, $c_2 = 8.0$.\n- Behavior $3$: Leaving social gathering early. $f_3 = 6$, $p_3 = 0.80$, $a_3 = 7.0$, $r_3 = 6.0$, $e_3 = 2.0$, $c_3 = 6.0$.\n- Behavior $4$: Procrastinating by watching videos. $f_4 = 14$, $p_4 = 0.70$, $a_4 = 6.5$, $r_4 = 5.0$, $e_4 = 6.0$, $c_4 = 7.0$.\n- Behavior $5$: Going for a brief walk. $f_5 = 10$, $p_5 = 0.40$, $a_5 = 4.0$, $r_5 = 2.5$, $e_5 = 7.5$, $c_5 = 2.0$.\n\nStarting from the foundational operant conditioning law of effect and the formal definition of negative reinforcement, derive a dimensionless negative reinforcement likelihood score $N_i$ for each behavior $i$ that satisfies the monotonicity constraints above and is constructed only from $\\{f_i, p_i, a_i, r_i, e_i\\}$. Next, derive a clinical priority score $P_i$ for TRAC conversion that additionally depends on $c_i$ and is strictly increasing in $c_i$.\n\nCompute the clinical priority scores for all behaviors and then provide, in descending order of $P_i$, the indices of the top three behaviors prioritized for TRAC conversion. Express the final ordered indices in a single row matrix. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The foundational base is the operant conditioning law of effect and the formal definition of negative reinforcement. The law of effect states that behaviors are strengthened as a function of reinforcement magnitude and rate. Negative reinforcement is specifically the increase in behavior frequency due to the removal or reduction of an aversive stimulus contingent on the behavior. Therefore, a quantitative index of the likelihood that behavior $i$ is maintained by negative reinforcement must reflect: higher weekly frequency $f_i$, higher proportion of episodes with aversive antecedents $p_i$, greater antecedent aversiveness $a_i$, and greater immediate relief $r_i$. Because enjoyment $e_i$ represents positive reinforcement (addition of appetitive stimuli), the negative reinforcement likelihood should decrease as $e_i$ increases, reflecting competing positive reinforcement.\n\nA parsimonious dimensionless index respecting these monotonicities and the law of effect is constructed multiplicatively for factors that increase likelihood and divisively for enjoyment:\n$$\nN_i \\equiv \\frac{f_i \\, p_i \\, a_i \\, r_i}{1 + e_i}.\n$$\nThis index is strictly increasing in $f_i$, $p_i$, $a_i$, and $r_i$, and strictly decreasing in $e_i$; the term $1+e_i$ ensures the denominator is positive for nonnegative $e_i$, preserving well-definedness. The multiplicative structure aligns with the law of effect by scaling with both reinforcement magnitude (via $r_i$ and $a_i$) and rate (via $f_i$ and $p_i$).\n\nClinical prioritization for Trigger-Response-Alternative Coping (TRAC) conversion should also weight the functional impairment cost $c_i$, reflecting the clinical urgency to address behaviors that carry higher costs. A strictly increasing function of $c_i$ that preserves proportionality to $N_i$ is the product:\n$$\nP_i \\equiv N_i \\, c_i = \\frac{f_i \\, p_i \\, a_i \\, r_i}{1 + e_i} \\, c_i.\n$$\n\nWe now compute $N_i$ and $P_i$ for each behavior using the provided data.\n\nBehavior $1$:\n$$\nN_1 = \\frac{28 \\cdot 0.55 \\cdot 5.0 \\cdot 3.5}{1 + 4.5} = \\frac{269.5}{5.5} = 49.0,\n$$\n$$\nP_1 = 49.0 \\cdot 3.0 = 147.0.\n$$\n\nBehavior $2$:\n$$\nN_2 = \\frac{21 \\cdot 0.90 \\cdot 8.0 \\cdot 7.5}{1 + 1.0} = \\frac{1134.0}{2.0} = 567.0,\n$$\n$$\nP_2 = 567.0 \\cdot 8.0 = 4536.0.\n$$\n\nBehavior $3$:\n$$\nN_3 = \\frac{6 \\cdot 0.80 \\cdot 7.0 \\cdot 6.0}{1 + 2.0} = \\frac{201.6}{3.0} = 67.2,\n$$\n$$\nP_3 = 67.2 \\cdot 6.0 = 403.2.\n$$\n\nBehavior $4$:\n$$\nN_4 = \\frac{14 \\cdot 0.70 \\cdot 6.5 \\cdot 5.0}{1 + 6.0} = \\frac{318.5}{7.0} = 45.5,\n$$\n$$\nP_4 = 45.5 \\cdot 7.0 = 318.5.\n$$\n\nBehavior $5$:\n$$\nN_5 = \\frac{10 \\cdot 0.40 \\cdot 4.0 \\cdot 2.5}{1 + 7.5} = \\frac{40.0}{8.5} = \\frac{80}{17},\n$$\n$$\nP_5 = \\frac{80}{17} \\cdot 2.0 = \\frac{160}{17}.\n$$\n\nWe order behaviors by descending $P_i$:\n- $P_2 = 4536.0$,\n- $P_3 = 403.2$,\n- $P_4 = 318.5$,\n- $P_1 = 147.0$,\n- $P_5 = \\frac{160}{17}$.\n\nThus, the top three behaviors prioritized for Trigger-Response-Alternative Coping (TRAC) conversion, in descending order, are indices $2$, $3$, and $4$.\n\nThe requested final output is the ordered indices expressed as a single row matrix.",

            "introduction": "A cornerstone of Behavioral Activation is the careful scheduling and pacing of activities to increase a patient's contact with positive reinforcement. This exercise operationalizes the clinical art of pacing by using a patient's recent adherence data to titrate the number of planned activities for the upcoming week. Mastering this calculation  helps ensure that activity plans remain within a 'mastery band,' optimizing success and building self-efficacy while minimizing the risk of demoralization.",

            "problem": "In Behavioral Activation (BA) for depression, clinicians schedule activities to increase contact with positive reinforcement, with a focus on maintaining high rates of successful completion to strengthen self-efficacy and reduce avoidance. Two fundamental bases apply here: (i) the adherence rate, defined as the ratio of completed activities to planned activities, and (ii) the expected value rule from probability theory that the expected number of successes across independent Bernoulli trials equals the number of trials times the success probability. In BA practice, a commonly targeted \"mastery band\" of adherence is between $0.7$ and $0.85$ to optimize reinforcement while minimizing demoralizing failure rates.\n\nA patient planned $20$ activities in the current week and completed $12$. Using the adherence rate definition and the expected value rule under the approximation that each activity next week will have the same completion probability equal to the targeted adherence, first compute the current adherence rate. Then, to propose a pacing adjustment consistent with BA principles, select a next-week plan that preserves the expected number of completed activities at the current level to sustain reinforcement, while moving the adherence into the mastery band by targeting an adherence of $0.75$. Assume independence of completion events and homogeneous per-activity completion probabilities next week.\n\nWhat is the recommended number of activities to plan for next week under these assumptions? Report only the count of activities as your final answer (no units). Express any intermediate adherence quantities as decimals. No rounding is needed because the final count should be an integer if the target is achievable exactly.",
            "solution": "Let $N_{\\text{planned, current}}$ be the number of planned activities in the current week, and $N_{\\text{completed, current}}$ be the number of completed activities in the current week.\nFrom the problem statement, we have:\n$$N_{\\text{planned, current}} = 20$$\n$$N_{\\text{completed, current}} = 12$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the current adherence rate, $A_{\\text{current}}$. The adherence rate is defined as the ratio of completed activities to planned activities.\n$$A_{\\text{current}} = \\frac{N_{\\text{completed, current}}}{N_{\\text{planned, current}}} = \\frac{12}{20} = 0.6$$\nThis adherence rate of $0.6$ is below the specified \"mastery band\" of $0.7$ to $0.85$, which justifies the need for an adjustment in the next week's plan.\n\nThe next task is to determine the recommended number of activities to plan for the next week, which we will denote as $N_{\\text{planned, next}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies two conditions for this new plan.\nFirst, the expected number of completed activities next week, $E[N_{\\text{completed, next}}]$, must be equal to the number of completed activities this week.\n$$E[N_{\\text{completed, next}}] = N_{\\text{completed, current}} = 12$$\n\nSecond, the plan for the next week should target an adherence rate, $A_{\\text{target}}$, of $0.75$. This target adherence rate is assumed to be the probability, $p$, of completing each planned activity next week.\n$$p = A_{\\text{target}} = 0.75$$\n\nThe problem states that we can use the expected value rule for independent Bernoulli trials. Each planned activity is a trial, and \"completing the activity\" is a success. The number of trials is $n = N_{\\text{planned, next}}$, and the probability of success for each trial is $p = 0.75$. The expected number of successes (completed activities) is given by:\n$$E[N_{\\text{completed, next}}] = n \\times p = N_{\\text{planned, next}} \\times p$$\n\nWe can now combine these equations to solve for $N_{\\text{planned, next}}$. We substitute the known values into the equation:\n$$12 = N_{\\text{planned, next}} \\times 0.75$$\n\nSolving for $N_{\\text{planned, next}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{planned, next}} = \\frac{12}{0.75}$$\nTo perform the calculation, we can express the decimal $0.75$ as a fraction, $\\frac{3}{4}$.\n$$N_{\\text{planned, next}} = \\frac{12}{\\frac{3}{4}} = 12 \\times \\frac{4}{3}$$\n$$N_{\\text{planned, next}} = 4 \\times 4 = 16$$\n\nThe recommended number of activities to plan for the next week is $16$. This plan adheres to the clinical strategy: it maintains the same level of expected reinforcement (12 completed activities) while increasing the expected adherence rate to $0.75$, which falls within the target mastery band of $0.7$ to $0.85$. The adjustment involves reducing the total number of planned activities from $20$ to $16$ to make the adherence target more achievable, which is a core principle of pacing in Behavioral Activation.",

Let the individual change score be defined as $\\Delta_i = \\text{PHQ-9}_{\\text{post},i} - \\text{PHQ-9}_{\\text{pre},i}$ so that a negative change reflects symptom reduction.

            "solution": "The objective is to compute the effect size, Cohen's $d$, for a repeated-measures design. The problem explicitly specifies using the standardized mean change definition. This variant of Cohen's $d$, sometimes denoted $d_z$ or $d_{avg}$, is calculated by dividing the mean of the difference scores by the standard deviation of the difference scores.\n\nLet $\\Delta_i$ represent the change score for the $i$-th individual, defined as the post-intervention score minus the pre-intervention score:\n$$\n\\Delta_i = \\text{Score}_{\\text{post},i} - \\text{Score}_{\\text{pre},i}\n$$\nThe problem provides the sample mean of these change scores, $\\bar{\\Delta}$, and the sample standard deviation of these change scores, $s_{\\Delta}$.\nThe given values are:\n$$\n\\bar{\\Delta} = -6\n$$\n$$\ns_{\\Delta} = 4\n$$\nThe formula for Cohen's $d$ based on the change-score distribution is:\n$$\nd = \\frac{\\bar{\\Delta}}{s_{\\Delta}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values into this formula yields:\n$$\nd = \\frac{-6}{4}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction gives the final value for the effect size:\n$$\nd = -\\frac{3}{2} = -1.5\n$$\nThe problem also asks for an interpretation of the magnitude of this effect size relative to conventional benchmarks. The widely accepted conventions for the magnitude of a standardized mean difference (Cohen's $d$) are:\n-   Small effect: $|d| \\approx 0.2$\n-   Medium effect: $|d| \\approx 0.5$\n-   Large effect: $|d| \\approx 0.8$\n\nThe calculated effect size is $d = -1.5$. The magnitude is $|d| = |-1.5| = 1.5$. Since $1.5$ is substantially greater than the benchmark of $0.8$ for a large effect, the observed treatment effect of Behavioral Activation in this cohort is considered very large. The negative sign correctly indicates that the change was a reduction in symptom severity, as the PHQ-9 scores decreased on average from pre- to post-intervention.",
