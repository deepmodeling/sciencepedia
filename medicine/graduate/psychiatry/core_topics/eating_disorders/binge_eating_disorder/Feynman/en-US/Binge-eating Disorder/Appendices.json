This exercise focuses on translating raw symptom data—in this case, the frequency of binge-eating episodes—into standardized metrics for tracking progress. By calculating the percentage reduction in symptoms and mapping this change onto the formal severity specifiers from the DSM-5, you will practice the core skills required for monitoring individual patient outcomes and making evidence-based adjustments to care.

            "problem": "A practitioner is evaluating treatment response in a patient with Binge-Eating Disorder using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) severity specifiers, which are based on binge-eating episode frequency per week: mild ($1$–$3$), moderate ($4$–$7$), severe ($8$–$13$), extreme ($\\geq 14$). The patient’s baseline binge frequency was $f_{0} = 10$ episodes per week and, following a structured cognitive-behavioral intervention, the post-treatment frequency is $f_{1} = 3$ episodes per week. Using first principles, define the percentage reduction in binge frequency as the proportional decrease relative to baseline, and determine the patient’s shift in severity under DSM-5 specifiers. Report only the percentage reduction as a decimal in your final numeric answer. Round your final numeric answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The foundational base for quantifying change in symptom frequency is the definition of proportional reduction relative to the baseline value. Given a baseline frequency $f_{0}$ and a post-treatment frequency $f_{1}$, the proportional reduction $R$ is defined as\n$$\nR = \\frac{f_{0} - f_{1}}{f_{0}}.\n$$\nThis expression derives from the general measurement principle that a percentage reduction is the decrease divided by the baseline, expressed as a proportion.\n\nWe are given $f_{0} = 10$ and $f_{1} = 3$. Substituting these values,\n$$\nR = \\frac{10 - 3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7.\n$$\nTo satisfy the rounding requirement of four significant figures, we express $0.7$ to four significant figures as $0.7000$.\n\nNext, we classify severity according to DSM-5 specifiers using weekly binge frequency categories:\n- Mild: $1$–$3$ episodes per week,\n- Moderate: $4$–$7$ episodes per week,\n- Severe: $8$–$13$ episodes per week,\n- Extreme: $\\geq 14$ episodes per week.\n\nAt baseline, $f_{0} = 10$ episodes per week falls within the severe ($8$–$13$) category. Post-treatment, $f_{1} = 3$ episodes per week falls within the mild ($1$–$3$) category. Therefore, the patient’s severity shifts from severe to mild. As instructed, only the numerical percentage reduction is reported in the final answer, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nThus, the required final numeric value is $0.7000$.",

This practice introduces Cohen's $d$, a standardized mean difference that allows for a universal interpretation of treatment efficacy across different studies and outcome measures.

Assume that change scores in each arm are approximately normally distributed and independent across participants, and that the variability of change is homogeneous across arms.\n\nIn the treatment arm, the sample mean reduction in weekly binge-eating episodes is $4$ with a sample standard deviation of $3$. In the control arm, the sample mean reduction is $1$ with a sample standard deviation of $3$.

Express your result as a unitless number and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the standardized mean difference, commonly known as Cohen's $d$, for a two-group independent samples design.\n\nFirst, a validation of the problem statement is performed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Study design: Randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n- Population: Adults with binge-eating disorder (DSM-5).\n- Endpoint: Change in weekly binge-eating episodes from baseline to week $12$, defined as (baseline episodes) - (week $12$ episodes).\n- Endpoint distribution: Approximately normal in each arm.\n- Independence: Observations are independent across participants.\n- Homoscedasticity: The variability (variance) of change scores is homogeneous across arms.\n- Treatment arm sample mean reduction: $\\bar{x}_T = 4$.\n- Treatment arm sample standard deviation of reduction: $s_T = 3$.\n- Control arm sample mean reduction: $\\bar{x}_C = 1$.\n- Control arm sample standard deviation of reduction: $s_C = 3$.\n- Task: Compute Cohen's $d$ for two independent groups under homoscedasticity.\n- Output specification: Round the result to three significant figures.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is assessed for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard statistical-methodological task in the context of clinical research. The use of an RCT, a defined clinical population, a specific endpoint, and an effect size measure (Cohen's $d$) are all standard and well-established practices in psychiatry and related fields.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary numerical values (two means, two standard deviations) and specifies the exact statistical quantity to be computed. The assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity are explicitly stated, defining the context for the calculation.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using clear, precise, and unbiased language.\n- **Consistency**: The givens are internally consistent. The assumption of homoscedasticity is supported by the fact that the sample standard deviations provided are identical ($s_T = s_C = 3$), which is a specific instance of homogeneity. The problem does not contain contradictory information. Although sample sizes ($n_T, n_C$) are not provided, their absence does not invalidate the problem, as will be demonstrated in the solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective request for a standard statistical calculation. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe standardized mean difference for two independent groups, Cohen's $d$, is defined as the difference between the two group means divided by the pooled standard deviation. The formula is:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{s_p}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}_T$ and $\\bar{x}_C$ are the sample means of the treatment and control groups, respectively, and $s_p$ is the pooled standard deviation.\n\nThe problem states that the endpoint is the reduction in symptoms, and provides the mean reductions directly:\n- Mean reduction in treatment arm: $\\bar{x}_T = 4$\n- Mean reduction in control arm: $\\bar{x}_C = 1$\n\nThe pooled standard deviation, $s_p$, is an estimate of the common population standard deviation, calculated under the assumption of homoscedasticity (equal variances). The formula for $s_p$ is:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_T - 1)s_T^2 + (n_C - 1)s_C^2}{n_T + n_C - 2}}$$\nwhere $n_T$ and $n_C$ are the sample sizes, and $s_T$ and $s_C$ are the sample standard deviations for the treatment and control groups, respectively.\n\nThe problem provides the sample standard deviations:\n- $s_T = 3$\n- $s_C = 3$\n\nA crucial observation is that the sample standard deviations are identical. We can substitute these values into the formula for the pooled standard deviation:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_T - 1)(3)^2 + (n_C - 1)(3)^2}{n_T + n_C - 2}}$$\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{9(n_T - 1) + 9(n_C - 1)}{n_T + n_C - 2}}$$\nFactoring out the constant $9$:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{9((n_T - 1) + (n_C - 1))}{n_T + n_C - 2}}$$\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{\\frac{9(n_T + n_C - 2)}{n_T + n_C - 2}}$$\nAs long as the total sample size $n_T + n_C > 2$, the term $(n_T + n_C - 2)$ is non-zero and cancels out:\n$$s_p = \\sqrt{9}$$\n$$s_p = 3$$\nThus, because the sample standard deviations are equal, the pooled standard deviation $s_p$ is also equal to this common value, regardless of the specific sample sizes of the two groups. The problem is constructed such that the sample sizes are not required for the calculation.\n\nNow we can compute Cohen's $d$ by substituting the values of the means and the pooled standard deviation into the primary formula:\n$$d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_T - \\bar{x}_C}{s_p} = \\frac{4 - 1}{3}$$\n$$d = \\frac{3}{3}$$\n$$d = 1$$\n\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The integer $1$ expressed with three significant figures is $1.00$. The result is a unitless measure of effect size, as required.",

            "introduction": "While effect size quantifies the magnitude of an intervention's impact, clinicians and health systems often need a more direct measure of its practical utility. This exercise guides you in calculating the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a highly intuitive and powerful metric derived from clinical trial data.

            "problem": "A randomized controlled trial evaluates Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for Binge-Eating Disorder (BED), defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), with remission operationalized as zero objective binge episodes in the past $28$ days at end of treatment. Participants meeting DSM-5 criteria for BED are randomized to CBT versus an active control condition that includes psychoeducation and supportive management. Let the observed end-of-treatment remission probabilities be $p_{T} = 0.45$ in the CBT arm and $p_{C} = 0.25$ in the control arm. Assume binary outcomes, stable outcome ascertainment, and that assignment is independent of potential outcomes due to randomization.\n\nStarting from foundational definitions in clinical epidemiology, derive the absolute risk reduction (ARR) as a risk difference computed from the remission probabilities and then, based on the standard operational definition of number needed to treat (NNT) for beneficial interventions, infer the NNT. Provide a brief clinical interpretation regarding how many additional remissions are achieved per treated cohort under CBT relative to control. Report only the NNT as your final numeric answer, with no units.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard scenario from clinical epidemiology and biostatistics with all necessary information to proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from the provided remission probabilities in a randomized controlled trial.\n\nLet $p_T$ be the probability of the outcome of interest (remission) in the treatment arm (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT).\nLet $p_C$ be the probability of the outcome of interest (remission) in the control arm (active control).\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given:\n$$ p_T = 0.45 $$\n$$ p_C = 0.25 $$\n\nThe outcome, remission, is a beneficial event. The first step is to quantify the absolute difference in the probability of this beneficial event between the two arms. This quantity is known as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) or, more precisely in the case of a beneficial outcome, the Absolute Benefit Increase (ABI). It is calculated as the difference between the event rate in the treatment group and the event rate in the control group.\n\nThe formula for the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR) is:\n$$ ARR = p_T - p_C $$\n\nThis value represents the excess proportion of patients who experience the beneficial outcome in the treatment group compared to the control group. Substituting the given values:\n$$ ARR = 0.45 - 0.25 = 0.20 $$\n\nThis means that the CBT intervention leads to an additional $20\\%$ of patients achieving remission compared to the active control condition.\n\nNext, we are asked to infer the Number Needed to Treat (NNT). The NNT is a measure of the effectiveness of an intervention. It is operationally defined as the average number of patients who need to be treated with the experimental therapy to achieve one additional beneficial outcome compared to the control therapy. Mathematically, the NNT is the reciprocal of the Absolute Risk Reduction.\n\nThe formula for NNT is:\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR} $$\n\nThis relationship is definitional. If an intervention results in an excess of $ARR$ positive outcomes per person treated, then it follows that $1/ARR$ people must be treated to achieve one full additional positive outcome.\n\nUsing the calculated value of $ARR$:\n$$ NNT = \\frac{1}{0.20} $$\n$$ NNT = 5 $$\n\nThe NNT is an integer in this case, and no rounding is necessary.\n\nFinally, a brief clinical interpretation is requested. An NNT of $5$ signifies that for every $5$ patients with Binge-Eating Disorder who are treated with CBT instead of the active control (psychoeducation and supportive management), we can expect one additional patient to achieve remission at the end of treatment. To address the question of how many additional remissions are achieved per treated cohort, we can state that for a cohort of $N$ patients, treatment with CBT instead of the control is expected to produce $N \\times ARR$ additional remissions. For instance, in a cohort of $100$ patients, CBT would yield $100 \\times 0.20 = 20$ additional remissions compared to the control condition. This is consistent with an NNT of $5$, as $100 / 5 = 20$.",
