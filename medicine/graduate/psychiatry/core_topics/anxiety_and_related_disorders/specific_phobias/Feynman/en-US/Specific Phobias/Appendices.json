However, a positive screen does not equal a diagnosis. This exercise utilizes Bayes' theorem to calculate the actual probability of a patient having a specific phobia given a positive result, demonstrating how a test's predictive value is critically dependent on the disorder's prevalence in the population . Mastering this calculation is fundamental to interpreting diagnostic evidence accurately and avoiding common clinical reasoning fallacies.",

            "solution": "Let $D$ denote the event that a patient has Specific Phobia, and let $D^c$ denote the event that the patient does not have Specific Phobia. Let $T+$ denote the event of a positive test result and $T-$ denote the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The point prevalence, or prior probability of the disease: $P(D) = 0.05$.\n2.  The sensitivity of the instrument: $Se = P(T+|D) = 0.85$. This is the conditional probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease.\n3.  The specificity of the instrument: $Sp = P(T-|D^c) = 0.90$. This is the conditional probability of a negative test given that the patient does not have the disease.\n\nWe are asked to derive an expression for the posterior probability that the patient truly has Specific Phobia given a positive screen, which is denoted as $P(D|T+)$, and then to compute its value.\n\nWe begin with the definition of conditional probability, which forms the basis of Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(D \\cap T+)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe numerator, $P(D \\cap T+)$, can be re-expressed using the definition of conditional probability again: $P(D \\cap T+) = P(T+|D) P(D)$.\nThe denominator, $P(T+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be calculated by considering the two mutually exclusive and exhaustive scenarios in which a positive test can occur: a true positive (patient has the disease and tests positive) and a false positive (patient does not have the disease but tests positive). Using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D) + P(T+ \\cap D^c)$$\nAgain, applying the definition of conditional probability to each term:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) + P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\n\nWe are given $P(T+|D) = Se$ and $P(D)$. We need to determine the remaining terms, $P(D^c)$ and $P(T+|D^c)$.\nThe probability of not having the disease, $P(D^c)$, is the complement of the prevalence:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D)$$\nThe probability $P(T+|D^c)$ is the false positive rate. It is the complement of the specificity, $Sp = P(T-|D^c)$, because a patient who does not have the disease can either test negative (specificity) or test positive (false positive). Thus:\n$$P(T+|D^c) = 1 - P(T-|D^c) = 1 - Sp$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the formula for $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P(D))$$\n\nNow we substitute the full expression for $P(T+)$ into the initial Bayes' theorem formula for $P(D|T+)$:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D) P(D)}{P(T+|D)P(D) + (1 - Sp)(1 - P(D))}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the posterior probability in terms of prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value using the given parameters: $P(D) = 0.05$, $Se = 0.85$, and $Sp = 0.90$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability of a true positive, which is the numerator:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D) = Se \\cdot P(D) = 0.85 \\times 0.05 = 0.0425$$\n\nNext, we calculate the probability of a false positive, which is the second term in the denominator:\n$$P(T+ \\cap D^c) = P(T+|D^c)P(D^c) = (1 - Sp)(1 - P(D))$$\n$$P(T+ \\cap D^c) = (1 - 0.90)(1 - 0.05) = 0.10 \\times 0.95 = 0.0950$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, is the sum of the true positive and false positive probabilities:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+ \\cap D) + P(T+ \\cap D^c) = 0.0425 + 0.0950 = 0.1375$$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability, $P(D|T+)$:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{0.0425}{0.1375} \\approx 0.30909090...$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$P(D|T+) \\approx 0.3091$$\n\nThis value, often called the positive predictive value (PPV) of the test, represents the probability that a patient with a positive screening result actually has the disease.\n\nThe clinical implication of this posterior probability of approximately $31\\%$ is that a positive result on this ultrabrief screening instrument is not, by itself, a sufficient basis for a definitive diagnosis of Specific Phobia or to initiate treatment. Even after a positive screen, a patient is still more likely to not have the disorder (a probability of $1 - 0.3091 \\approx 69\\%$) than to have it. The screen successfully identifies a subpopulation at higher risk than the general population (risk increased from $5\\%$ to $31\\%$), but the rate of false positives is substantial. Therefore, the correct clinical action following a positive screen is to proceed with a more thorough diagnostic assessment, such as a structured clinical interview conducted by a mental health professional, to confirm or rule out the diagnosis before considering a treatment plan.",

            "problem": "A patient cohort is being studied to differentiate two subtypes of specific phobias within psychiatry: Blood-Injection-Injury (BII) and animal phobia. Blood-Injection-Injury (BII) phobia is characterized by a biphasic autonomic pattern including an initial heart rate increase followed by a vasovagal drop; animal phobia is characterized by sustained sympathetic arousal. Heart rate is recorded relative to a resting baseline, with two summary features: the initial change at $30$ seconds, denoted $x$, and the net change at $120$ seconds, denoted $y$. For BII, the simplified pattern is an initial heart rate increase of $10$ beats per minute (bpm) followed by a $20$ bpm drop within $2$ minutes, implying a net $y$ of approximately $-10$ bpm. For animal phobia, the simplified pattern is a sustained $15$ bpm increase at $2$ minutes, implying a net $y$ of approximately $+15$ bpm.\n\nAssume a generative model in which for each class $c \\in \\{\\text{BII}, \\text{AN}\\}$ the net change $y$ arises from a Gaussian distribution with class-conditional mean $\\mu_{c}$ and common variance $\\sigma^{2}$, where $\\mu_{\\text{BII}} = -10$, $\\mu_{\\text{AN}} = 15$, and $\\sigma = 6$.

            "solution": "The goal is to derive an optimal classification rule that minimizes misclassification error and then to compute its accuracy.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Optimal Decision Rule**\n\nBayes decision theory states that for a $0$-$1$ loss function, the rule that minimizes expected misclassification is to assign a new observation $y$ to the class with the highest posterior probability. We should predict BII if $P(\\text{BII}|y) > P(\\text{AN}|y)$ and AN otherwise.\n\nUsing Bayes' rule, the posterior probability for a class $c$ is given by $P(c|y) = \\frac{p(y|c)P(c)}{p(y)}$, where $p(y|c)$ is the class-conditional likelihood and $P(c)$ is the class prior. The decision rule is thus:\n$$\\text{Predict BII if } p(y|\\text{BII})P(\\text{BII}) > p(y|\\text{AN}})P(\\text{AN})$$\nWe are given equal class priors, $P(\\text{BII}) = P(\\text{AN}) = 1/2$. The rule simplifies to a comparison of the likelihoods:\n$$\\text{Predict BII if } p(y|\\text{BII}) > p(y|\\text{AN}})$$\nThe class-conditional likelihoods are given as Gaussian distributions:\n$$p(y|c) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-\\mu_c)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nSubstituting these into the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-\\mu_{\\text{BII}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) > \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(y-\\mu_{\\text{AN}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides preserves the inequality:\n$$-\\frac{(y-\\mu_{\\text{BII}})^2}{2\\sigma^2} > -\\frac{(y-\\mu_{\\text{AN}})^2}{2\\sigma^2}$$\nMultiplying by $-2\\sigma^2$ reverses the inequality:\n$$(y-\\mu_{\\text{BII}})^2  (y-\\mu_{\\text{AN}})^2$$\nExpanding the squares:\n$$y^2 - 2y\\mu_{\\text{BII}} + \\mu_{\\text{BII}}^2  y^2 - 2y\\mu_{\\text{AN}} + \\mu_{\\text{AN}}^2$$\n$$ - 2y\\mu_{\\text{BII}} + \\mu_{\\text{BII}}^2  - 2y\\mu_{\\text{AN}} + \\mu_{\\text{AN}}^2$$\n$$2y(\\mu_{\\text{AN}} - \\mu_{\\text{BII}})  \\mu_{\\text{AN}}^2 - \\mu_{\\text{BII}}^2$$\n$$2y(\\mu_{\\text{AN}} - \\mu_{\\text{BII}})  (\\mu_{\\text{AN}} - \\mu_{\\text{BII}})(\\mu_{\\text{AN}} + \\mu_{\\text{BII}})$$\nSince $\\mu_{\\text{AN}} = 15$ and $\\mu_{\\text{BII}} = -10$, the term $(\\mu_{\\text{AN}} - \\mu_{\\text{BII}})$ is positive, so we can divide by it without changing the inequality:\n$$2y  \\mu_{\\text{AN}} + \\mu_{\\text{BII}}$$\n$$y  \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{AN}} + \\mu_{\\text{BII}}}{2}$$\nThis gives us the decision rule: predict BII if $y$ is less than the midpoint of the two means.

Computation of Expected Accuracy**\n\nThe expected accuracy of the classifier is the total probability of making a correct decision:\n$$Accuracy = P(\\text{correct}) = P(\\text{predict BII, is BII}) + P(\\text{predict AN, is AN})$$\n$$Accuracy = P(\\text{predict BII} | \\text{is BII}) P(\\text{is BII}) + P(\\text{predict AN} | \\text{is AN}) P(\\text{is AN})$$\nGiven priors $P(\\text{is BII}) = P(\\text{is AN}) = 1/2$:\n$$Accuracy = \\frac{1}{2} P(y  2.5 | y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-10, 6^2)) + \\frac{1}{2} P(y \\ge 2.5 | y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(15, 6^2))$$\nWe standardize these probabilities using the Z-score, $Z = (Y - \\mu)/\\sigma$:\nFor the first term (correctly classifying BII):\n$$P(y  2.5 | y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(-10, 6^2)) = P\\left(Z  \\frac{2.5 - (-10)}{6}\\right) = P\\left(Z  \\frac{12.5}{6}\\right) \\approx P(Z  2.0833)$$\nFor the second term (correctly classifying AN):\n$$P(y \\ge 2.5 | y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(15, 6^2)) = P\\left(Z \\ge \\frac{2.5 - 15}{6}\\right) = P\\left(Z \\ge -\\frac{12.5}{6}\\right) \\approx P(Z \\ge -2.0833)$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. Then $P(Z  z) = \\Phi(z)$ and $P(Z \\ge -z) = 1 - \\Phi(-z)$. Due to the symmetry of the normal distribution, $\\Phi(-z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$, so $1 - \\Phi(-z) = 1 - (1-\\Phi(z)) = \\Phi(z)$.\nTherefore, both probabilities are equal:\n$$P(\\text{correctly classifying BII}) = P(\\text{correctly classifying AN}) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{12.5}{6}\\right)$$\nThe total accuracy is:\n$$Accuracy = \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi\\left(\\frac{12.5}{6}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi\\left(\\frac{12.5}{6}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{12.5}{6}\\right)$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$Accuracy = \\Phi(2.08333...) \\approx 0.98139$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the expected accuracy is $0.9814$.",

The BAT comprises $10$ levels, each representing a progressively higher vantage point, with exposure parameters standardized across sessions. The patient’s task is to approach and remain at each level for $2$ minutes. The BAT score is defined as the highest level fully completed without violating stopping rules. Levels are as follows: level $1$ ($3$ m balcony), level $2$ ($6$ m balcony), level $3$ ($9$ m balcony), level $4$ ($12$ m balcony), level $5$ ($15$ m balcony), level $6$ ($18$ m balcony), level $7$ ($21$ m balcony), level $8$ ($24$ m balcony), level $9$ ($27$ m balcony), level $10$ ($30$ m rooftop observation deck).

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an index to quantify whether an observed change in scores between two test administrations is statistically meaningful, i.e., greater than what would be expected due to measurement error alone. This index is known as the Reliable Change Index (RCI). The derivation will proceed from the first principles of Classical Test Theory (CTT).\n\nAccording to CTT, any observed score, $X$, is composed of a true score, $T$, and a random error component, $E$.\n$$X = T + E$$\nThe error component $E$ is assumed to have a mean of zero and be uncorrelated with the true score $T$.\n\nThe variance of the observed scores, $\\sigma_X^2$, can be decomposed into the variance of the true scores, $\\sigma_T^2$, and the variance of the error scores, $\\sigma_E^2$:\n$$\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_E^2$$\n\nThe reliability of a test, $r$, is defined as the proportion of the observed score variance that is attributable to the true score variance. For test-retest reliability, this is denoted as $r_{XX'}$.\n$$r = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{\\sigma_X^2}$$\n\nFrom this definition, we can express the error variance, $\\sigma_E^2$, in terms of the observed score variance and reliability.\n$$r = \\frac{\\sigma_X^2 - \\sigma_E^2}{\\sigma_X^2} = 1 - \\frac{\\sigma_E^2}{\\sigma_X^2}$$\nRearranging for $\\sigma_E^2$ gives:\n$$\\sigma_E^2 = \\sigma_X^2 (1 - r)$$\nThe standard deviation of the error distribution, $\\sigma_E$, is called the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM).\n$$SEM = \\sigma_E = \\sigma_X \\sqrt{1 - r}$$\nIn this problem, the normative standard deviation $\\sigma$ is equivalent to $\\sigma_X$.\n$$SEM = \\sigma \\sqrt{1 - r}$$\n\nWe are interested in the change between two observed scores, $X_1$ from session $1$ and $X_6$ from session $6$. The difference score is $D = X_6 - X_1$. To determine if this change is \"reliable,\" we must compare it to the amount of change expected from measurement error alone. This requires calculating the standard deviation of the distribution of difference scores, which is known as the Standard Error of the Difference ($S_{diff}$).\n\nThe difference score $D$ can be written in terms of true and error scores:\n$$D = X_6 - X_1 = (T_6 + E_6) - (T_1 + E_1) = (T_6 - T_1) + (E_6 - E_1)$$\nTo evaluate the reliability of the change, we consider the null hypothesis that no true change has occurred, i.e., $T_6 - T_1 = 0$. Under this hypothesis, any observed difference is due solely to measurement error, $D = E_6 - E_1$.\n\nThe variance of this error of difference, $\\sigma_{diff}^2$, is given by:\n$$\\sigma_{diff}^2 = Var(E_6 - E_1)$$\nAssuming the errors of the two administrations are uncorrelated ($Cov(E_6, E_1) = 0$), a standard assumption in CTT, the variance of the difference is the sum of the variances:\n$$\\sigma_{diff}^2 = Var(E_6) + Var(E_1)$$\nSince both scores come from the same test administered under standard conditions, we assume their error variances are equal to the squared Standard Error of Measurement:\n$$Var(E_6) = Var(E_1) = SEM^2$$\nTherefore,\n$$\\sigma_{diff}^2 = SEM^2 + SEM^2 = 2 \\cdot SEM^2$$\nThe Standard Error of the Difference, $S_{diff}$, is the square root of this variance:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot SEM^2} = SEM \\sqrt{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $SEM$:\n$$S_{diff} = (\\sigma \\sqrt{1 - r}) \\sqrt{2} = \\sigma \\sqrt{2(1 - r)}$$\nThis is the standard deviation of the distribution of change scores that would be expected if no real change had occurred.\n\nThe Reliable Change Index (RCI) is a $z$-score that standardizes the observed change $X_6 - X_1$ by dividing it by the Standard Error of the Difference, $S_{diff}$.\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_6 - X_1}{S_{diff}}$$\nSubstituting the derived formula for $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{X_6 - X_1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2(1 - r)}}$$\nThis is the derived index for quantifying whether the observed change exceeds what is expected from measurement error alone.\n\nNow, we compute its value using the provided parameters:\n-   $X_1 = 3$\n-   $X_6 = 8$\n-   $\\sigma = 2.5$\n-   $r = 0.90$\n\nFirst, calculate the observed difference:\n$$X_6 - X_1 = 8 - 3 = 5$$\nNext, calculate the Standard Error of the Difference, $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = 2.5 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.90)} = 2.5 \\sqrt{2(0.10)} = 2.5 \\sqrt{0.20}$$\nNow, compute the RCI:\n$$RCI = \\frac{5}{2.5 \\sqrt{0.20}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{0.20}}$$\nTo simplify, $\\sqrt{0.20} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{5}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$.\n$$RCI = \\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}} = 2\\sqrt{5}$$\nFinally, we calculate the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$RCI = 2 \\times 2.2360679... = 4.4721359...$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $4.472$.\nA conventional threshold for statistical significance of the RCI is $|RCI| \\ge 1.96$, corresponding to a p-value of $0.05$ (two-tailed).
