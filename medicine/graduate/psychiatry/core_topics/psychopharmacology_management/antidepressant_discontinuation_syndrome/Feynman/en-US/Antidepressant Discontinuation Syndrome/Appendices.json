            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard pharmacokinetic principles, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in modeling the decay of two substances, a parent drug (sertraline, $S$) and its active metabolite (desmethylsertraline, $M$), after discontinuation. The problem specifies that for time $t \\ge 0$, the concentrations of both species decline monoexponentially from their steady-state values according to first-order elimination kinetics.\n\nThe general equation for first-order elimination is:\n$$C(t) = C(0) \\exp(-kt)$$\nwhere $C(t)$ is the concentration at time $t$, $C(0)$ is the initial concentration, and $k$ is the elimination rate constant. The rate constant $k$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\n\nAt the moment of discontinuation, $t=0$, the concentrations are at their steady-state values, which we denote as $C_{S,ss}$ and $C_{M,ss}$. Thus, for $t \\ge 0$:\n$$C_S(t) = C_S(0) \\exp(-k_S t) = C_{S,ss} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,S}} t\\right)$$\n$$C_M(t) = C_M(0) \\exp(-k_M t) = C_{M,ss} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,M}} t\\right)$$\n\nThe problem defines a normalized effective concentration, $E(t)$, as a proxy for the total pharmacodynamic effect, taking into account the relative potency ($p$) of the metabolite.\n$$E(t) = \\frac{C_S(t) + pC_M(t)}{C_S(0) + pC_M(0)}$$\nBy definition, at $t=0$, the initial concentrations are $C_S(0) = C_{S,ss}$ and $C_M(0) = C_{M,ss}$. Substituting these into the definition of $E(t)$:\n$$E(t) = \\frac{C_{S,ss} \\exp(-k_S t) + pC_{M,ss} \\exp(-k_M t)}{C_{S,ss} + pC_{M,ss}}$$\n\nWe are given the steady-state concentration ratio $R = \\frac{C_{M,ss}}{C_{S,ss}}$. This allows us to express $C_{M,ss}$ in terms of $C_{S,ss}$ as $C_{M,ss} = R \\cdot C_{S,ss}$. We can substitute this relationship into the expression for $E(t)$:\n$$E(t) = \\frac{C_{S,ss} \\exp(-k_S t) + p(R \\cdot C_{S,ss}) \\exp(-k_M t)}{C_{S,ss} + p(R \\cdot C_{S,ss})}$$\nThe term $C_{S,ss}$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator and can be cancelled.

We must solve the equation $E(t^{\\ast}) = 0.4$:\n$$0.4 = \\frac{\\exp(-k_S t^{\\ast}) + 0.3 \\exp(-k_M t^{\\ast})}{1.3}$$\nMultiplying both sides by $1.3$:\n$$0.52 = \\exp(-k_S t^{\\ast}) + 0.3 \\exp(-k_M t^{\\ast})$$\nLet's substitute the rate constants:\n$$0.52 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.1} t^{\\ast}\\right) + 0.3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3.5} t^{\\ast}\\right)$$\nThis is a transcendental equation for $t^{\\ast}$ and does not have a closed-form analytical solution. It must be solved numerically. Let's define a function $f(t)$ for which we seek a root:\n$$f(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{1.1} t\\right) + 0.3 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{3.5} t\\right) - 0.52$$\nWe are looking for $t^{\\ast}$ such that $f(t^{\\ast}) = 0$.

This means $f(t)$ is a strictly monotonically decreasing function. At $t=0$, $f(0) = 1 + 0.3 - 0.52 = 0.78 > 0$. As $t \\to \\infty$, $f(t) \\to -0.52$. Because $f(t)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing from a positive to a negative value, a unique positive root $t^{\\ast}$ must exist.\n\nUsing a numerical root-finding algorithm (such as the Newton-Raphson method or bisection method), we can find the value of $t^{\\ast}$.\nLet's test values to bracket the root:\nFor $t=1$: $f(1) \\approx \\exp(-0.6301) + 0.3 \\exp(-0.1980) - 0.52 \\approx 0.5325 + 0.3(0.8204) - 0.52 \\approx 0.2586 > 0$.\nFor $t=2$: $f(2) \\approx \\exp(-1.2603) + 0.3 \\exp(-0.3961) - 0.52 \\approx 0.2836 + 0.3(0.6729) - 0.52 \\approx -0.0345 < 0$.\nThe root $t^{\\ast}$ lies between $1$ and $2$ days. A numerical solver yields:\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx 1.84805\\ \\mathrm{days}$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$t^{\\ast} = 1.85\\ \\mathrm{days}$$\nThis is the estimated time at which the effective drug concentration falls below the threshold hypothesized to trigger discontinuation symptoms.",

0.10 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*})$$\n$$0.10 \\cdot EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}} = 0.90 \\cdot C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*})$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*}) = \\frac{0.10}{0.90} EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{1}{9} EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}$$\n\nNext, we use the definition of the equivalent concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t)$, which is given as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t) = C_{\\mathrm{flu}}(t) + \\gamma\\,C_{\\mathrm{nor}}(t)$$\nThe potency-weighting factor $\\gamma$ is defined as the ratio of the $EC_{50}$ values:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}}{EC_{50,\\mathrm{nor}}}$$\nThe concentrations of fluoxetine, $C_{\\mathrm{flu}}(t)$, and norfluoxetine, $C_{\\mathrm{nor}}(t)$, at time $t$ after a single oral dose $D_{\\mathrm{flu}}$ are modeled as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{flu}}(t) = \\frac{F D_{\\mathrm{flu}}}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{nor}}(t) = \\frac{F D_{\\mathrm{flu}}}{V_{\\mathrm{nor}}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t)$$\nHere, $F$ is the bioavailability, $V$ is the volume of distribution, and $k$ is the first-order elimination rate constant, defined as $k = \\ln(2)/t_{1/2}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*})$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*}) = \\frac{F D_{\\mathrm{flu}}}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*}) + \\gamma \\frac{F D_{\\mathrm{flu}}}{V_{\\mathrm{nor}}}\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*})$$\nWe can factor out $F D_{\\mathrm{flu}}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*}) = F D_{\\mathrm{flu}} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}} + \\frac{\\gamma \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{nor}}} \\right)$$\nNow, we equate our two expressions for $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}(t^{*})$:\n$$\\frac{1}{9} EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}} = F D_{\\mathrm{flu}} \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}} + \\frac{\\gamma \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{nor}}} \\right)$$\nWe can now solve for the desired dose, $D_{\\mathrm{flu}}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{9} EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}}{F \\left( \\frac{\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}} + \\frac{\\gamma \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*})}{V_{\\mathrm{nor}}} \\right)}$$\nGiven that $V_{\\mathrm{flu}} = V_{\\mathrm{nor}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{L}$, we can simplify this expression:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{9} EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}}{ \\frac{F}{V_{\\mathrm{flu}}} \\left( \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*}) + \\gamma \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*}) \\right) }$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{flu}} \\cdot EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}}{9 F \\left( \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*}) + \\gamma \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*}) \\right)}$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for $D_{\\mathrm{flu}}$.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value using the provided data:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{flu}} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{L}$\n- $EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- $EC_{50,\\mathrm{nor}} = 0.075\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}$\n- $F = 1$\n- $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{flu}} = 48\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- $t_{1/2,\\mathrm{nor}} = 240\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n- $t^{*} = 96\\,\\mathrm{h}$\n\nFirst, calculate the intermediate parameters $\\gamma$, $k_{\\mathrm{flu}}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{nor}}$:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{EC_{50,\\mathrm{flu}}}{EC_{50,\\mathrm{nor}}} = \\frac{0.15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{0.075\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}} = 2$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{flu}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{48}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n$$k_{\\mathrm{nor}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2,\\mathrm{nor}}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{240}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\nNext, calculate the exponential terms at $t^{*} = 96\\,\\mathrm{h}$:\n$$\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{flu}} t^{*}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{48} \\cdot 96\\right) = \\exp(-2\\ln(2)) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-2})) = 2^{-2} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n$$\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{nor}} t^{*}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{240} \\cdot 96\\right) = \\exp\\left(-0.4\\ln(2)\\right) = \\exp(\\ln(2^{-0.4})) = 2^{-0.4}$$\n$$2^{-0.4} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{0.4} \\approx 0.757858$$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the analytical expression for $D_{\\mathrm{flu}}$:\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{1400\\,\\mathrm{L} \\cdot 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mg/L}}{9 \\cdot 1 \\left( 0.25 + 2 \\cdot 2^{-0.4} \\right)}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{9 \\left( 0.25 + 2 \\cdot 0.757858 \\right)}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{9 \\left( 0.25 + 1.515716 \\right)}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{9 \\left( 1.765716 \\right)}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} = \\frac{210\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{15.891444}$$\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} \\approx 13.2149\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final numerical answer to three significant figures.\n$$D_{\\mathrm{flu}} \\approx 13.2\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$",
