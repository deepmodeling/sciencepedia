            "introduction": "A primary goal in mental health research is to develop and evaluate interventions that reduce stigma. To move beyond simply asking if an intervention worked, we must quantify *how well* it worked. This practice introduces Cohen’s $d$ as a standardized effect size, a crucial tool for interpreting the clinical significance of a change in stigma scores following an intervention .",

            "problem": "A randomized clinical trial in psychiatry evaluated a contact-based anti-stigma intervention among adults receiving community mental health services. Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) total scores were collected at baseline and eight weeks post-intervention. The study reported a mean change in ISMI score (post minus pre) of $-6.5$ points, and the pooled standard deviation across the two time points of $9.0$ points. Using accepted principles of effect size quantification in behavioral sciences, compute the standardized mean difference (Cohen’s $d$) for the intervention effect and then interpret its magnitude for clinical relevance in the context of stigma reduction. Provide the numerical value of $d$ as a dimensionless quantity. Round your numerical answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard statistical task based on plausible data from a clinical trial context. All necessary information is provided, and the requested calculation and interpretation are central to quantitative methods in behavioral sciences.\n\nThe problem requires the computation and interpretation of Cohen's $d$, a standardized measure of effect size. For a within-subjects or repeated-measures design (such as a pre-test/post-test study), one common method to calculate Cohen's $d$ is to divide the mean change by a standard deviation that standardizes this change. The problem specifies the necessary components for this calculation.\n\nLet $\\bar{x}_{change}$ represent the mean change in the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) score from baseline (pre-intervention) to the eight-week follow-up (post-intervention). The problem states this value is:\n$$ \\bar{x}_{change} = -6.5 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that, on average, the ISMI scores decreased, which signifies a reduction in internalized stigma.\n\nLet $s_{pooled}$ represent the pooled standard deviation across the two time points. This value is provided as the standardizer for the mean change. The problem gives:\n$$ s_{pooled} = 9.0 $$\n\nThe formula for Cohen's $d$ in this context is the ratio of the mean change to the pooled standard deviation:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\bar{x}_{change}}{s_{pooled}} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values into the formula:\n$$ d = \\frac{-6.5}{9.0} $$\n\nPerforming the division gives:\n$$ d = -0.7222... $$\n\nThe problem requires the numerical answer to be rounded to three significant figures. Therefore, the value of Cohen's $d$ is:\n$$ d \\approx -0.722 $$\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret the magnitude of this effect size for clinical relevance. The interpretation relies on established conventions, primarily those proposed by Cohen. According to these conventions, the magnitude of $d$ (ignoring the sign) is interpreted as follows:\n- $|d| \\approx 0.2$ is considered a small effect.\n- $|d| \\approx 0.5$ is considered a medium effect.\n- $|d| \\approx 0.8$ is considered a large effect.\n\nOur calculated value is $|d| \\approx 0.722$. This value falls between the benchmarks for a medium effect ($0.5$) and a large effect ($0.8$). It is substantially larger than a medium effect and approaches the threshold for a large effect. Therefore, it is appropriately characterized as a medium-to-large, or simply a large, effect size.\n\nIn the context of this psychiatric intervention, a Cohen's $d$ of $-0.722$ indicates that the contact-based anti-stigma program had a large and beneficial impact. The average participant's ISMI score decreased by approximately $0.722$ standard deviations. An effect of this magnitude is generally considered not only statistically significant but also clinically relevant, suggesting that the intervention produced a meaningful and substantial reduction in internalized stigma for the individuals in the trial. The effect is strong enough to be noticeable and important from a practical, clinical standpoint.",

            "introduction": "Stigma can manifest as discriminatory behavior, often in subtle ways within healthcare systems. This exercise explores diagnostic overshadowing, where a mental health diagnosis can unfortunately lead to the dismissal of physical health complaints.

            "problem": "A hospital system is auditing whether patients presenting with physical health complaints receive an appropriate medical referral, with concern about diagnostic overshadowing—where a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis biases clinicians away from making appropriate somatic referrals. Suppose the audit models the probability of appropriate referral, denoted by $p$, using a logistic regression grounded in the standard definition of the logit function $\\logit(p)=\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right)$ and the logistic link between the linear predictor and the probability. The model includes two predictors: an indicator $D\\in\\{0,1\\}$ for the presence ($D=1$) versus absence ($D=0$) of any current psychiatric diagnosis, and a continuous measure $S$ of somatic symptom severity. The linear predictor is parameterized by intercept $\\alpha$ and slopes $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$.\n\nUsing well-tested and widely accepted logistic regression structure for binary outcomes, let the audit’s fitted coefficients be $\\alpha=-1.2$, $\\beta_1=-0.7$, and $\\beta_2=1.1$.

Then, grounded in the definition of odds and the log-odds scale, explain how the sign and magnitude of $\\beta_1$ encode diagnostic overshadowing’s effect on appropriate referral when controlling for somatic symptom severity.\n\nRound your numerical probability to four significant figures and express it as a decimal.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established statistical framework of logistic regression, well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a predicted probability from a fitted logistic regression model and an interpretation of one of the model's coefficients.\n\nFirst, we establish the formal structure of the logistic regression model. The linear predictor, denoted by $\\eta$, is a linear combination of the predictor variables. Given the intercept $\\alpha$, the coefficient $\\beta_1$ for the psychiatric diagnosis indicator $D$, and the coefficient $\\beta_2$ for somatic symptom severity $S$, the linear predictor is:\n$$\n\\eta = \\alpha + \\beta_1 D + \\beta_2 S\n$$\nThe logistic regression model links this linear predictor to the probability $p$ of the outcome (appropriate referral) via the logit function:\n$$\n\\text{logit}(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\eta\n$$\nTo find the probability $p$, we must solve for $p$ in terms of $\\eta$. Exponentiating both sides gives the odds:\n$$\n\\frac{p}{1-p} = \\exp(\\eta)\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\np = (1-p)\\exp(\\eta) \\implies p = \\exp(\\eta) - p\\exp(\\eta) \\implies p(1 + \\exp(\\eta)) = \\exp(\\eta)\n$$\nThis yields the logistic function, which is the inverse of the logit function:\n$$\np = \\frac{\\exp(\\eta)}{1 + \\exp(\\eta)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the fitted coefficients: $\\alpha = -1.2$, $\\beta_1 = -0.7$, and $\\beta_2 = 1.1$. We are asked to compute the probability $p$ for a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis ($D=1$) and a somatic symptom severity score of $S=2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the value of the linear predictor $\\eta$ for this specific patient:\n$$\n\\eta = \\alpha + \\beta_1 D + \\beta_2 S = (-1.2) + (-0.7)(1) + (1.1)(2)\n$$\n$$\n\\eta = -1.2 - 0.7 + 2.2 = 0.3\n$$\nNow, we substitute this value of $\\eta$ into the logistic function to find the predicted probability $p$:\n$$\np = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-\\eta)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(-0.3)}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\np \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.74081822} = \\frac{1}{1.74081822} \\approx 0.5744425\n$$\nThe problem requires this probability to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\np \\approx 0.5744\n$$\n\nNext, we address the second part of the question: explaining how the sign and magnitude of $\\beta_1$ encode the effect of diagnostic overshadowing. In this model, diagnostic overshadowing corresponds to the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis ($D=1$) being associated with a lower probability of appropriate referral, after controlling for the level of somatic symptom severity ($S$).\n\nThe coefficient $\\beta_1$ represents the change in the log-odds of the outcome for a one-unit change in the predictor $D$, holding all other predictors constant. A one-unit change in $D$ corresponds to comparing a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis ($D=1$) to a patient without one ($D=0$), where both have the same somatic symptom severity $S$.\n\nLet's compare the log-odds for two such patients:\nLog-odds for patient with diagnosis ($D=1$): $\\ln(\\text{odds}_1) = \\alpha + \\beta_1(1) + \\beta_2 S$\nLog-odds for patient without diagnosis ($D=0$): $\\ln(\\text{odds}_0) = \\alpha + \\beta_1(0) + \\beta_2 S$\n\nThe difference in log-odds is:\n$$\n\\ln(\\text{odds}_1) - \\ln(\\text{odds}_0) = (\\alpha + \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 S) - (\\alpha + \\beta_2 S) = \\beta_1\n$$\nThis difference is also the natural logarithm of the odds ratio (OR):\n$$\n\\beta_1 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\text{odds}_1}{\\text{odds}_0}\\right) \\implies \\text{OR} = \\exp(\\beta_1)\n$$\nThe odds ratio quantifies the multiplicative effect on the odds of referral due to the presence of a psychiatric diagnosis.\n\nThe fitted value is $\\beta_1 = -0.7$.\nThe **sign** of $\\beta_1$ is negative. A negative value indicates that $\\ln(\\text{odds}_1)  \\ln(\\text{odds}_0)$, which implies that $\\text{odds}_1  \\text{odds}_0$. This means that, for any given level of somatic symptom severity, the odds of receiving an appropriate referral are lower for a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis than for a patient without one. This negative association is the statistical evidence of diagnostic overshadowing within this model.\n\nThe **magnitude** of $\\beta_1$, which is $|-0.7| = 0.7$, determines the strength of this effect. The corresponding odds ratio is:\n$$\n\\text{OR} = \\exp(\\beta_1) = \\exp(-0.7) \\approx 0.4966\n$$\nThis value, being less than $1$, confirms the negative association. Specifically, it means the odds of an appropriate referral for a patient with a psychiatric diagnosis are approximately $0.4966$ times (or $49.66\\%$) the odds for an otherwise identical patient without a psychiatric diagnosis. This corresponds to a reduction in odds of approximately $100\\% \\times (1 - 0.4966) = 50.34\\%$. Therefore, the magnitude of $\\beta_1$ quantifies a substantial decrease in the likelihood of appropriate referral, providing a measure of the strength of the diagnostic overshadowing effect.\n\nIn summary, the negative sign of $\\beta_1$ establishes the presence of diagnostic overshadowing, and its magnitude, through the calculation of the odds ratio $\\exp(\\beta_1)$, quantifies the size of this detrimental effect on appropriate referral.",

Let $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicate whether an individual reports experiencing discrimination in the past year.

Using the foundational definitions of risk and risk difference, derive the appropriate interaction contrast on the risk scale that quantifies deviation from additivity, compute it from the given $p_{ij}$ values, and state whether the joint effect exhibits synergy or antagonism on the additive scale.\n\nExpress the final interaction contrast as a decimal fraction without a percent sign.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is grounded in standard epidemiological principles for assessing interaction, is well-posed with all necessary data, and is objective. The task is to calculate the interaction contrast on the additive (risk) scale to determine if the combined effect of two stigma-related exposures is synergistic.\n\nThe interaction contrast ($IC$) on the risk scale quantifies the deviation from additivity. It is calculated by comparing the observed risk in the doubly-exposed group ($p_{11}$) to the risk expected if the individual effects were purely additive. The formula is:\n$$ IC = p_{11} - p_{10} - p_{01} + p_{00} $$\nThis formula represents the excess risk from the joint exposure beyond the sum of the individual excess risks.\n\nWe are given the following risks:\n-   $p_{00}$ (no exposures) = $0.10$\n-   $p_{10}$ (mental illness only) = $0.22$\n-   $p_{01}$ (race only) = $0.18$\n-   $p_{11}$ (both exposures) = $0.44$\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ IC = 0.44 - 0.22 - 0.18 + 0.10 $$\n$$ IC = (0.44 + 0.10) - (0.22 + 0.18) $$\n$$ IC = 0.54 - 0.40 $$\n$$ IC = 0.14 $$\n\nThe interpretation of the interaction contrast is as follows:\n-   If $IC = 0$, the effects are purely additive.\n-   If $IC > 0$, there is positive interaction, or **synergy**, meaning the joint effect is greater than the sum of individual effects.\n-   If $IC  0$, there is negative interaction, or **antagonism**.\n\nOur calculated value is $IC = 0.14$. Since this value is positive, the joint effect exhibits synergy on the additive scale. This means the risk of discrimination for an individual with both a mental illness label and a minoritized racial identity is $0.14$ (or 14 percentage points) higher than would be expected if the risks from each identity were simply added together.
