            "problem": "You are tasked with formalizing a categorical decision rule for a diagnostic category that is defined by necessary and sufficient conditions, and then implementing it as a deterministic program. The context is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) formulation of a major depressive disorder episode, but you must treat the problem purely as a problem in formal logic and computation over a fixed-length tuple derived from a structured clinical interview.\n\nUse the following modeling conventions and base facts, which are to be treated as given, foundational constraints:\n\n- The input for each case is an ordered tuple $(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ where:\n  - $s$ is the total count of concurrently present nonoverlapping depressive symptoms from a canonical set of $9$ domains, with $0 \\le s \\le 9$, integer-valued.\n  - $d \\in \\{0,1\\}$ encodes the presence ($1$) or absence ($0$) of depressed mood.\n  - $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$ encodes the presence ($1$) or absence ($0$) of markedly diminished interest or pleasure.\n  - $t$ is the episode duration in days (express the unit in days), with $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$.\n  - $i \\in \\{0,1\\}$ encodes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (present $1$, absent $0$).\n  - $u \\in \\{0,1\\}$ encodes whether the presentation is better explained as attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition (attributable $1$, not attributable $0$).\n  - $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$ encodes any lifetime history of manic or hypomanic episodes (present $1$, absent $0$).\n  - $f \\in [0,1]$ is the fraction of days on which the symptom cluster is present at the required intensity, represented as a decimal (not a percent), where $f = 1$ indicates presence nearly every day and $f = 0$ indicates no days.\n\n- Treat the following as well-tested, domain-establishing facts for this category:\n  1. A cardinal-symptom gate: at least one of the two cardinal features must be present, i.e., at least one of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure is present.\n  2. A symptom-count threshold: a minimum of $5$ concurrent symptoms (from the $9$-domain set) must be met.\n  3. A minimum duration threshold: the episode must last at least $14$ days.\n  4. A frequency-intensity regularity: the symptoms should be present on most days; for computational purposes, operationalize “most days” as $f \\ge \\theta$, where you must select and justify a principled threshold $\\theta$ in the open interval $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n  5. Clinical significance: the presentation must involve clinically significant distress or impairment (encoded by $i = 1$).\n  6. Exclusion rules: the presentation must not be better explained by substances or another medical condition ($u = 0$), and there must be no lifetime history of mania or hypomania ($b = 0$).\n\nYour task is to:\n\n- From the above base facts and the general principles of necessary and sufficient conditions in category membership, derive a precise predicate that maps $(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ to a categorical diagnosis flag $X \\in \\{\\text{True}, \\text{False}\\}$, and also returns the observed symptom count $s$ unchanged.\n- You must make an explicit, justified choice of the threshold $\\theta$ for “most days” within $(\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1]$, and use it consistently.\n- Implement an algorithm that evaluates the predicate for a fixed test suite of cases (provided below) and outputs, for each case, a two-element list $[X, s]$ aggregating all cases in order into a single list.\n\nTest suite specification (each row is one case $(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$; the day unit must be treated as “days,” and $f$ must be treated as a decimal in $[0,1]$):\n\n1. $(5, 1, 0, 14, 1, 0, 0, \\$\\tfrac{2}{3}\\$)$\n2. $(7, 0, 0, 30, 1, 0, 0, 0.9)$\n3. $(8, 1, 0, 13, 1, 0, 0, 0.8)$\n4. $(6, 1, 1, 20, 1, 1, 0, 0.8)$\n5. $(6, 1, 0, 20, 1, 0, 1, 0.8)$\n6. $(9, 1, 1, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0.9)$\n7. $(5, 0, 1, 14, 1, 0, 0, 0.66)$\n8. $(9, 1, 1, 60, 1, 0, 0, 0.95)$\n\nFinal output format requirement:\n\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a two-element list $[X, s]$ in the same order as the test suite (for example, $[[\\text{True}, 5],[\\text{False}, 3],\\dots]$). No additional text or lines should be printed.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe input is an ordered tuple $(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ with the following definitions:\n- $s$: total count of concurrently present nonoverlapping depressive symptoms, $s \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\n- $d$: presence ($1$) or absence ($0$) of depressed mood, $d \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- $a$: presence ($1$) or absence ($0$) of markedly diminished interest or pleasure, $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- $t$: episode duration in days, $t \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$.\n- $i$: clinically significant distress or impairment, $i \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- $u$: attributable to substance or another medical condition, $u \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- $b$: lifetime history of manic or hypomanic episodes, $b \\in \\{0,1\\}$.\n- $f$: fraction of days with symptom cluster presence, $f \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe categorical decision rule is based on six necessary and sufficient conditions:\n1.  **Cardinal-symptom gate**: At least one of depressed mood ($d=1$) or diminished interest/pleasure ($a=1$) must be present.\n2.  **Symptom-count threshold**: A minimum of $5$ symptoms must be present, $s \\ge 5$.\n3.  **Minimum duration threshold**: The episode must last at least $14$ days, $t \\ge 14$.\n4.  **Frequency-intensity regularity**: Symptoms must be present \"most days\", operationalized as $f \\ge \\theta$ for a selected $\\theta \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n5.  **Clinical significance**: Distress or impairment must be present, $i=1$.\n6.  **Exclusion rules**: The presentation must not be attributable to a substance/medical condition ($u=0$) and there must be no history of mania/hypomania ($b=0$).\n\nThe task is to derive a predicate $X(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ yielding a Boolean value, choose and justify $\\theta$, and implement this predicate for a given test suite. The output for each case is a list $[X, s]$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is an exercise in formal logic and algorithmic implementation. It uses a simplified model of psychiatric diagnosis as its context but explicitly requires treatment as a formal problem. The premises are a set of axioms to be implemented, not scientific claims to be debated. The formalization is a standard approach in rule-based systems and is scientifically sound from a computational perspective.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The input is clearly defined, and the rules provided are a complete set of necessary and sufficient conditions. This guarantees that for any given input tuple and a fixed $\\theta$, a unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists. The requirement to choose and justify $\\theta$ is an explicit part of the problem, not an ambiguity.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language using mathematical and logical constraints. It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n-   **No Flaws**: The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. It is complete, consistent, formalizable, and non-trivial. The test data are consistent with the variable definitions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to construct a predicate $X(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ that evaluates to $\\text{True}$ if and only if all specified conditions are met. Since the conditions are both necessary and sufficient, the overall predicate is a logical conjunction (AND operation) of the individual predicates corresponding to each rule.\n\nFirst, a principled choice for the frequency threshold $\\theta$ must be made. The problem requires $\\theta \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2}, 1]$ to operationalize \"most days\". A value of $\\theta = \\tfrac{2}{3}$ is selected. This choice is justified as follows:\n1.  It is a simple, well-understood rational number that is clearly greater than $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n2.  It represents a substantial majority (a $2$-to-$1$ ratio of days with symptoms to days without), which is a reasonable interpretation of \"most\" that is stricter than a simple majority ($>\\tfrac{1}{2}$) but less restrictive than \"nearly every day\" (which might imply $\\theta \\ge 0.9$).\n3.  It provides a clear, reproducible computational standard. For the minimum duration of $14$ days, this threshold requires symptoms to be present on at least $14 \\times \\tfrac{2}{3} \\approx 9.33$, i.e., $10$ days, which is clinically reasonable.\n\nWith $\\theta = \\tfrac{2}{3}$, we can now formalize each of the six conditions:\n\n1.  **Cardinal-symptom gate**: $(d=1) \\lor (a=1)$. In numerical terms, this is equivalent to $(d+a) \\ge 1$.\n2.  **Symptom-count threshold**: $s \\ge 5$.\n3.  **Minimum duration threshold**: $t \\ge 14$.\n4.  **Frequency-intensity regularity**: $f \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3}$.\n5.  **Clinical significance**: $i=1$.\n6.  **Exclusion rules**: $(u=0) \\land (b=0)$.\n\nThe final diagnostic predicate $X(s, d, a, t, i, u, b, f)$ combines these six conditions with a logical AND:\n$$\nX = \\left( (d+a) \\ge 1 \\right) \\land \\left( s \\ge 5 \\right) \\land \\left( t \\ge 14 \\right) \\land \\left( f \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3} \\right) \\land \\left( i = 1 \\right) \\land \\left( u = 0 \\right) \\land \\left( b = 0 \\right)\n$$\nThis expression evaluates to $\\text{True}$ if all sub-expressions are true, and $\\text{False}$ otherwise. The algorithm will evaluate this predicate for each case in the test suite and return the pair $[X, s]$.\n\nThe evaluation for each test case proceeds as follows:\n-   **Case 1**: $(5, 1, 0, 14, 1, 0, 0, \\$\\tfrac{2}{3}\\$)$. All criteria are met: $(1+0 \\ge 1)$, $(5 \\ge 5)$, $(14 \\ge 14)$, $(\\tfrac{2}{3} \\ge \\tfrac{2}{3})$, $(1=1)$, $(0=0)$, $(0=0)$. Result: $[\\text{True}, 5]$.\n-   **Case 2**: $(7, 0, 0, 30, 1, 0, 0, 0.9)$. Fails cardinal-symptom gate: $(0+0 < 1)$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 7]$.\n-   **Case 3**: $(8, 1, 0, 13, 1, 0, 0, 0.8)$. Fails duration threshold: $(13 < 14)$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 8]$.\n-   **Case 4**: $(6, 1, 1, 20, 1, 1, 0, 0.8)$. Fails exclusion rule for substance/medical cause: $(u=1)$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 6]$.\n-   **Case 5**: $(6, 1, 0, 20, 1, 0, 1, 0.8)$. Fails exclusion rule for bipolar history: $(b=1)$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 6]$.\n-   **Case 6**: $(9, 1, 1, 16, 0, 0, 0, 0.9)$. Fails clinical significance: $(i=0)$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 9]$.\n-   **Case 7**: $(5, 0, 1, 14, 1, 0, 0, 0.66)$. Fails frequency regularity: $0.66  \\tfrac{2}{3}$. Result: $[\\text{False}, 5]$.\n-   **Case 8**: $(9, 1, 1, 60, 1, 0, 0, 0.95)$. All criteria are met. Result: $[\\text{True}, 9]$.\n\nThe implementation will encode this logic and produce the final formatted list of results.",

            "introduction": "A key feature of modern psychiatric classification is its 'polythetic' nature, where a diagnosis requires a subset of criteria from a larger list, such as meeting at least $k$ out of $n$ possible symptoms.

This practice  uses a combinatorial approach to quantify this diagnostic heterogeneity, demonstrating how the very structure of the diagnostic rules generates a wide variety of clinical presentations under a single label.",
            "id": "4698095",
            "problem": "A categorical diagnostic system such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) can be modeled as a threshold rule on a finite set of criteria: a diagnosis is assigned if a patient endorses at least $k$ criteria out of $n$ possible criteria. Consider generalized anxiety disorder under a hypothetical classification with $n=6$ criteria and a threshold $k=3$. Assume the following generative model: each criterion is endorsed independently by each individual, with criterion-specific endorsement probabilities $p_{1},\\dots,p_{6}$ satisfying $0p_{j}1$ for all $j\\in\\{1,\\dots,6\\}$. Let a “symptom profile” be defined as the set of criteria endorsed by an individual.

Express your final answer as an exact integer without units. In your solution, explain the implications of your result for diagnostic heterogeneity under threshold-based classification systems. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of distinct symptom profiles among diagnosed individuals in an infinitely large cohort, under a categorical diagnostic model.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the definitions provided. A symptom profile is the set of criteria endorsed by an individual. With $n$ possible criteria, a profile can be represented as a subset $S$ of the set of all criteria indices, $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The total number of distinct possible symptom profiles is the number of subsets of this set, which is $2^n$.\n\nThe problem states that each criterion $j$ is endorsed independently with probability $p_j$, where $0  p_j  1$. The probability of a specific symptom profile $S$ being observed in a single individual is given by the product of the probabilities of endorsing the criteria in $S$ and not endorsing the criteria not in $S$:\n$$ P(S) = \\left(\\prod_{j \\in S} p_j\\right) \\left(\\prod_{j' \\notin S} (1-p_{j'})\\right) $$\nGiven the condition $0  p_j  1$ for all $j \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, both $p_j$ and $1-p_j$ are strictly positive. Therefore, the probability $P(S)$ for any profile $S$ is a product of positive numbers, meaning $P(S)  0$ for all $2^n$ possible profiles.\n\nA diagnosis is assigned if the number of endorsed criteria is at least $k$. The size of a symptom profile $S$ is its cardinality, $|S|$. Thus, a profile $S$ leads to a diagnosis if $|S| \\ge k$. Let $\\mathcal{D}$ be the set of all such \"diagnosed profiles\":\n$$ \\mathcal{D} = \\{S \\subseteq \\{1, \\dots, n\\} \\mid |S| \\ge k\\} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected number of distinct symptom profiles from the set $\\mathcal{D}$ that are observed in a cohort of size $N$, in the limit as $N \\to \\infty$. Let $N_S$ be the number of individuals with profile $S$ in a cohort of size $N$. The number of distinct diagnosed profiles is $\\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\mathbb{I}(N_S \\ge 1)$, where $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function.\n\nThe expected number of distinct diagnosed profiles in a cohort of size $N$, let's call it $E_N$, is:\n$$ E_N = E\\left[\\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\mathbb{I}(N_S \\ge 1)\\right] $$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can write:\n$$ E_N = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} E[\\mathbb{I}(N_S \\ge 1)] = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} P(N_S \\ge 1) $$\nFor any given profile $S$, the number of individuals $N_S$ in a cohort of size $N$ follows a binomial distribution $B(N, P(S))$. The probability of observing profile $S$ at least once is:\n$$ P(N_S \\ge 1) = 1 - P(N_S = 0) = 1 - (1-P(S))^N $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E_N$:\n$$ E_N = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\left(1 - (1-P(S))^N\\right) $$\nWe are asked to find the limit as $N \\to \\infty$:\n$$ E_{distinct} = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} E_N = \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\left(1 - (1-P(S))^N\\right) $$\nSince the sum is over the finite set $\\mathcal{D}$, we can exchange the limit and summation:\n$$ E_{distinct} = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - (1-P(S))^N\\right) $$\nFor each $S \\in \\mathcal{D}$, we have established that its probability $P(S)$ is strictly greater than $0$ and strictly less than $1$. Let $p_S = P(S)$. The limit term becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p_S)^N $$\nSince $0  p_S  1$, we have $0  1 - p_S  1$. A number in this range raised to an infinitely large power approaches $0$. Thus:\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} (1 - p_S)^N = 0 $$\nTherefore, for each profile $S \\in \\mathcal{D}$:\n$$ \\lim_{N \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - (1-P(S))^N\\right) = 1 - 0 = 1 $$\nThis signifies that in an arbitrarily large cohort, every possible diagnosed profile is expected to be observed. The expected number of distinct diagnosed profiles is then the sum of $1$ for each profile in $\\mathcal{D}$:\n$$ E_{distinct} = \\sum_{S \\in \\mathcal{D}} 1 = |\\mathcal{D}| $$\nThe problem thus reduces to a combinatorial one: counting the number of symptom profiles that meet the diagnostic criteria, i.e., the number of subsets of size at least $k$ from a set of $n$ criteria. This number is given by the sum of binomial coefficients:\n$$ |\\mathcal{D}| = \\sum_{m=k}^{n} \\binom{n}{m} $$\nWe are given $n=6$ and $k=3$. We need to evaluate:\n$$ |\\mathcal{D}| = \\sum_{m=3}^{6} \\binom{6}{m} = \\binom{6}{3} + \\binom{6}{4} + \\binom{6}{5} + \\binom{6}{6} $$\nCalculating each binomial coefficient:\n$\\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20$\n$\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15$\n$\\binom{6}{5} = \\frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6$\n$\\binom{6}{6} = \\frac{6!}{6!(6-6)!} = 1$\n\nSumming these values:\n$$ |\\mathcal{D}| = 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 42 $$\nThe expected number of distinct symptom profiles among diagnosed individuals is $42$.\n\nThe implication of this result for diagnostic heterogeneity is profound. The number $42$ quantifies the number of distinct combinations of symptoms that all lead to the same diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder under this model. Crucially, this number is entirely determined by the combinatorial structure of the diagnostic rule (the values of $n$ and $k$) and is independent of the specific criterion endorsement probabilities $p_j$, provided they are non-trivial. This means that regardless of whether individual symptoms are common or rare, the number of pathways to a diagnosis remains fixed. This phenomenon, where the same diagnosis can encompass individuals with potentially non-overlapping sets of symptoms (e.g., profiles $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{4,5,6\\}$ are both diagnosed but share no symptoms), is a major source of heterogeneity within diagnostic categories. This formal result highlights a fundamental limitation of categorical classification systems and provides a quantitative basis for understanding why individuals with the same psychiatric label can present with vastly different clinical pictures, which in turn complicates research and treatment planning.",

Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test result given that the individual has the disorder. This is the true positive rate.\n    $$ \\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.85 $$\n\n3.  Specificity is the probability of a negative test result given that the individual does not have the disorder. This is the true negative rate.\n    $$ \\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.90 $$\n\nFrom sensitivity and specificity, we can also derive the false negative and false positive rates:\n-   The false negative rate is the probability of a negative test given the disorder is present:\n    $$ P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15 $$\n-   The false positive rate is the probability of a positive test given the disorder is absent:\n    $$ P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\n**Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the probability that an individual has the disorder given a positive test result, $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem to derive this value:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It is found using the law of total probability, summing the probabilities of a positive test for individuals with and without the disorder:\n$$ P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for PPV:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.85)(0.10)}{(0.85)(0.10) + (0.10)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.085}{0.085 + 0.090} = \\frac{0.085}{0.175} $$\n$$ \\text{PPV} \\approx 0.48571428... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} = 0.4857$.\n\n**Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the probability that an individual does not have the disorder given a negative test result, $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T^-) = P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for NPV:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^- | D) P(D) + P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ \\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.90)}{(0.15)(0.10) + (0.90)(0.90)} = \\frac{0.81}{0.015 + 0.81} = \\frac{0.81}{0.825} $$\n$$ \\text{NPV} \\approx 0.98181818... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} = 0.9818$.\n\n**Clinical Implications**\n\n1.  **Implication of PPV for Ruling In:** The calculated Positive Predictive Value is $\\text{PPV} = 0.4857$. This means that among individuals who test positive with this structured interview, only about $48.6\\%$ of them actually have Major Depressive Disorder. The probability of a false positive is $1 - \\text{PPV} = 1 - 0.4857 = 0.5143$, or about $51.4\\%$. A PPV of less than $0.50$ is low and indicates that a positive test result is more likely to be a false positive than a true positive. Therefore, this interview is a poor tool for \"ruling in\" (confirming) a diagnosis of MDD. A positive result significantly increases the likelihood of disease from the baseline prevalence of $10\\%$ to a post-test probability of $48.6\\%$, but it is not sufficient for a definitive diagnosis. It should prompt a more thorough clinical assessment rather than be taken as confirmation of the disorder. This outcome is a classic example of how a low prevalence in the tested population constrains the PPV, even with good sensitivity and specificity.\n\n2.  **Implication of NPV for Ruling Out:** The calculated Negative Predictive Value is $\\text{NPV} = 0.9818$. This means that among individuals who test negative, the probability that they are truly free of Major Depressive Disorder is approximately $98.2\\%$. The probability of a false negative (i.e., the person has MDD despite a negative test) is very low, at $1 - \\text{NPV} = 1 - 0.9818 = 0.0182$, or about $1.8\\%$. An NPV this high provides strong evidence. Therefore, this interview is an excellent tool for \"ruling out\" MDD. A clinician can be highly confident that a patient with a negative result does not have the disorder, making it an effective screening instrument to reduce the need for further, more-resource-intensive psychiatric evaluation in a large proportion of the screened population.\n\nIn summary, the diagnostic interview is highly effective for confidently ruling out MDD in this low-prevalence setting, but it is not effective for ruling it in.",
