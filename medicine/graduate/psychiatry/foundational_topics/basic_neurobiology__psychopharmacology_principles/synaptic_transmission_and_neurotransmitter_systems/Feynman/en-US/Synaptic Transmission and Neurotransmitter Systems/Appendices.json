Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.3333$.\n\n### Qualitative Explanation of Receptor Reserve\n\nThe concept of **receptor reserve**, or **spare receptors**, addresses the relationship between receptor occupancy and the resulting physiological or biological response (efficacy). The calculated fractional occupancy, $\\theta$, is a measure of how many receptors are bound by the agonist, but it is not necessarily directly proportional to the magnitude of the biological effect.\n\nEfficacy refers to the ability of an agonist-receptor complex to produce a cellular response. In many physiological systems, a maximal response can be achieved when only a small fraction of the total receptor population is occupied. The receptors that are unoccupied when the maximal response is reached are termed \"spare receptors\" or constitute the \"receptor reserve.\"\n\nThis phenomenon arises from signal amplification in the downstream signaling cascade. Mu-opioid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). When an agonist binds to a single mu-opioid receptor, that receptor can activate multiple G-protein molecules. Each activated G-protein can then, for example, inhibit an adenylyl cyclase enzyme or modulate an ion channel, further amplifying the signal.\nDue to this amplification, it may not be necessary to occupy all, or even most, of the receptors to saturate the downstream signaling pathway and elicit the maximal possible tissue or cellular response.\n\nIn the context of this problem, the fractional occupancy is calculated to be $\\theta \\approx 0.3333$, or $33.33\\%$.\n- If there were **no** receptor reserve, the observed biological effect would be approximately $33.33\\%$ of the maximal possible effect ($E_{max}$). The response would be directly proportional to occupancy.\n- If there **is** a significant receptor reserve, a $33.33\\%$ occupancy could produce a response that is much higher than $33.33\\%$ of $E_{max}$. For a system with a very large reserve, this level of occupancy might even be sufficient to produce a near-maximal or maximal response ($E \\approx E_{max}$).\n\nTherefore, the existence of a receptor reserve causes the observed efficacy (response) to be greater than what would be predicted from a simple linear relationship with fractional occupancy. This concept is crucial for understanding the difference between full agonists, which can elicit a maximal response even with a small occupancy, and partial agonists, which may fail to produce a maximal response even at $100\\%$ receptor occupancy because they have lower intrinsic efficacy and cannot take full advantage of the receptor reserve.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-compartment neuron used to model cortical synaptic integration in psychiatry-relevant circuits. The membrane is passive and obeys conservation of charge with ohmic membrane and synaptic currents. At baseline, the neuron has a leak conductance $g_{L}$ with reversal potential $E_{L}$ and membrane capacitance $C$. Excitatory synaptic activation (for example, via $\\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors) is modeled as a conductance step of amplitude $g_{E}$ with reversal potential $E_{E}$. A tonic inhibitory conductance (for example, via gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA\\_A) receptors) is present with amplitude $g_{I}$ and reversal potential $E_{I}$. Assume that the inhibitory reversal equals the leak reversal, that is $E_{I}=E_{L}$, so that inhibition is shunting.\n\nStarting only from the following core facts: (i) each conductance contributes an ohmic current of the form $I_{x}=g_{x}\\left(V-E_{x}\\right)$, (ii) charge conservation requires that the sum of capacitive and ohmic currents equals zero, and (iii) steady-state is defined by $dV/dt=0$, perform the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysics and computational neuroscience, specifically using the standard single-compartment passive membrane model. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested quantities without ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nWe begin from the principle of charge conservation for a single-compartment neuron, as stipulated by core fact (ii). The total current flowing out of the compartment must be zero. This current is the sum of the capacitive current and the various ohmic ionic currents. The general equation is:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + \\sum_{x} I_{x} = 0$$\nwhere $C$ is the membrane capacitance, $V$ is the membrane potential, and $I_x$ are the individual ionic currents. Using core fact (i), each ohmic current is of the form $I_{x} = g_{x}(V - E_{x})$, where $g_x$ is the conductance and $E_x$ is the reversal potential for ion species or channel type $x$. For the system described, this equation becomes:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + I_{L} + I_{I} + I_{E} = 0$$\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_{L}(V - E_{L}) + g_{I}(V - E_{I}) + g_{E}(V - E_{E}) = 0$$\n\n1. To derive the effective membrane resistance and its effect on the resting potential in the presence of tonic shunting inhibition, we consider the case without excitatory activation, so $g_{E}=0$. The problem states that the inhibition is shunting, which is defined by the condition $E_{I} = E_{L}$. Substituting these into the general equation gives:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + g_{L}(V - E_{L}) + g_{I}(V - E_{L}) = 0$$\nCombining the terms with the common factor $(V - E_{L})$ yields:\n$$C \\frac{dV}{dt} + (g_{L} + g_{I})(V - E_{L}) = 0$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $V(t)$. The form of this equation shows that the total membrane conductance in this state is $g_{\\text{total}} = g_{L} + g_{I}$. The effective membrane resistance, $R_{\\text{eff}}$, is the inverse of the total conductance:\n$$R_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{g_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{g_{L} + g_{I}}$$\nTo find the resting membrane potential, $V_{\\text{rest}}$, we apply the steady-state condition from core fact (iii), which is $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$.\n$$(g_{L} + g_{I})(V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{L}) = 0$$\nSince the conductances $g_{L}$ and $g_{I}$ are non-negative and $g_L$ is implicitly positive for a physically realistic cell, their sum is positive. Therefore, the only way for the equation to hold is if $V_{\\text{rest}} - E_{L} = 0$, which means $V_{\\text{rest}} = E_{L}$. In the absence of any inhibition ($g_I=0$), the resting potential would also be $E_{L}$. Thus, adding a tonic shunting inhibitory conductance ($E_{I} = E_{L}$) does not change the value of the resting membrane potential. However, it does decrease the effective membrane resistance from $\\frac{1}{g_L}$ to $\\frac{1}{g_L+g_I}$, making the membrane \"leakier\".\n\n2. We now derive the steady-state amplitude of the excitatory postsynaptic potential ($\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}}$) produced by a conductance step $g_{E}$. The EPSP amplitude is the difference between the steady-state potential with excitatory input, $V_{\\text{ss}}$, and the resting potential, $V_{\\text{rest}} = E_{L}$. So, $\\Delta V_{\\text{EPSP}} = V_{\\text{ss}} - E_{L}$.\n\nCase A: Without inhibition ($g_{I} = 0$).\nAt steady-state ($\\frac{dV}{dt}=0$) with $g_E0$:\n$$g_{L}(V_{\\text{ss, no-I}} - E_{L}) + g_{E}(V_{\\text{ss, no-I}} - E_{E}) = 0$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{ss, no-I}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{ss, no-I}}(g_{L} + g_{E}) = g_{L}E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ss, no-I}} = \\frac{g_{L}E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}}{g_{L} + g_{E}}$$\nThe EPSP amplitude is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{no-I}} = V_{\\text{ss, no-I}} - E_{L} = \\frac{g_{L}E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}}{g_{L} + g_{E}} - E_{L} = \\frac{g_{L}E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E} - E_{L}(g_{L} + g_{E})}{g_{L} + g_{E}} = \\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{E}}$$\n\nCase B: With tonic shunting inhibition ($g_{I}  0$, $E_{I} = E_{L}$).\nAt steady-state ($\\frac{dV}{dt}=0$) with $g_E0$ and $g_I0$:\n$$g_{L}(V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{L}) + g_{I}(V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{L}) + g_{E}(V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{E}) = 0$$\n$$(g_{L} + g_{I})(V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{L}) + g_{E}(V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{E}) = 0$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{ss, shunt}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{ss, shunt}}(g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}) = (g_{L} + g_{I})E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}$$\n$$V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} = \\frac{(g_{L} + g_{I})E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}}$$\nThe EPSP amplitude is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{shunt}} = V_{\\text{ss, shunt}} - E_{L} = \\frac{(g_{L} + g_{I})E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E}}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}} - E_{L} = \\frac{(g_{L} + g_{I})E_{L} + g_{E}E_{E} - E_{L}(g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E})}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}} = \\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}}$$\n\n3. To demonstrate how shunting inhibition alters linear synaptic summation, we consider two simultaneous excitatory inputs, $g_{E1}$ and $g_{E2}$. The combined depolarization is calculated by replacing $g_E$ with $g_{E1} + g_{E2}$ in the formulas from part 2.\nWithout inhibition, the combined depolarization is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{combo, no-I}} = \\frac{(g_{E1} + g_{E2})(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{E1} + g_{E2}}$$\nWith shunting inhibition, the combined depolarization is:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{combo, shunt}} = \\frac{(g_{E1} + g_{E2})(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E1} + g_{E2}}$$\nThe denominator in the shunting case is strictly larger than in the no-inhibition case (for $g_I  0$). Therefore, $\\Delta V_{\\text{combo, shunt}}  \\Delta V_{\\text{combo, no-I}}$. Shunting inhibition reduces the depolarization produced by the sum of excitatory inputs.\n\nMore subtly, shunting inhibition alters the linearity of summation. Synaptic summation is inherently sublinear because each active synaptic conductance increases the total membrane conductance (the denominator), thereby reducing the voltage change produced by any other concurrently active synapse. The combined steady-state depolarization $\\Delta V(g_{E1}+g_{E2})$ is less than the arithmetic sum of the individual depolarizations $\\Delta V(g_{E1}) + \\Delta V(g_{E2})$. Shunting inhibition introduces a large, tonic conductance $g_I$ that is present regardless of synaptic activity. This \"pre-shunts\" the membrane. The total conductance during synaptic activity is $g_L + g_I + g_{E1} + g_{E2}$. Because $g_I$ adds a large constant value to the denominator, the *relative* change in total conductance caused by the synaptic inputs ($g_{E1}$, $g_{E2}$) is smaller than in the no-inhibition case. This reduction in the relative impact of synaptic conductances on the overall denominator makes the summation more linear (i.e., closer to arithmetic summation, although the absolute magnitude of the response is reduced).\n\n4. Finally, we define the multiplicative reduction factor $r_{\\text{shunt}}$ as the ratio of the steady-state EPSP amplitude with shunting inhibition to that without it, for a single excitatory conductance step $g_E$.\n$$r_{\\text{shunt}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{shunt}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{no-I}}}$$\nUsing the results from part 2:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{shunt}} = \\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}}$$\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{no-I}} = \\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{E}}$$\nWe form the ratio:\n$$r_{\\text{shunt}} = \\frac{\\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}}}{\\frac{g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})}{g_{L} + g_{E}}}$$\nAssuming $g_{E}  0$ and $E_{E} \\neq E_{L}$, the term $g_{E}(E_{E} - E_{L})$ cancels in the numerator and denominator:\n$$r_{\\text{shunt}} = \\frac{1 / (g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E})}{1 / (g_{L} + g_{E})}$$\nSimplifying this complex fraction gives the final expression:\n$$r_{\\text{shunt}} = \\frac{g_{L} + g_{E}}{g_{L} + g_{I} + g_{E}}$$\nThis expression is dimensionless, as it is a ratio of conductances. It is always less than $1$ for $g_I  0$, quantifying the divisive or multiplicative nature of shunting inhibition on synaptic efficacy.",
