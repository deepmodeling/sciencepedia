This exercise  provides a hands-on opportunity to quantify this fundamental principle of stress neurobiology by calculating receptor occupancy dynamics under different physiological conditions.",

            "problem": "In an advanced neuropsychiatry context, consider cortisol binding to two receptor classes that coordinate stress responses within the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis: the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR). Cortisol concentration in the brain microenvironment can be approximated by a free ligand concentration $[L]$ that changes between a basal state and an acute stress state. Assume quasi-steady-state binding governed by the law of mass action for the reaction $R + L \\rightleftharpoons RL$ with association rate $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and dissociation rate $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, and define the dissociation constant by $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$ at equilibrium. The fractional receptor occupancy is $f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$. Starting from these definitions, derive the equilibrium fractional occupancy $f$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$, then use your derived result to compute the occupancies for MR and GR at basal and stress ligand concentrations.\n\nLet the basal free cortisol concentration be $[L]_{\\mathrm{basal}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$ and the stress free cortisol concentration be $[L]_{\\mathrm{stress}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.

            "solution": "The first step is to derive the expression for the equilibrium fractional occupancy, $f$, in terms of the free ligand concentration, $[L]$, and the dissociation constant, $K_d$. We are given two definitions:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$$\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[R] + [RL]}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nFrom the definition of $K_d$, we can express the concentration of free receptors, $[R]$, as:\n$$[R] = K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for the fractional occupancy, $f$:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{\\left(K_{d} \\frac{[RL]}{[L]}\\right) + [RL]}$$\nWe can factor out $[RL]$ from the denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{[RL]}{[RL] \\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1\\right)}$$\nAssuming a non-zero concentration of bound receptors, $[RL] \\ne 0$, we can cancel this term from the numerator and denominator:\n$$f = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nTo simplify, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $[L]$:\n$$f = \\frac{[L]}{[L] \\left(\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1\\right)} = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis is the Hill-Langmuir equation, which describes the fractional occupancy of a receptor with a single binding site at equilibrium.\n\nNext, we use this derived formula to compute the fractional occupancies for the Mineralocorticoid Receptor (MR) and the Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) under basal and stress conditions.\n\nThe given parameters are:\nBasal ligand concentration: $[L]_{\\mathrm{basal}} = 1\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nStress ligand concentration: $[L]_{\\mathrm{stress}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nDissociation constant for MR: $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{MR}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\nDissociation constant for GR: $K_{d}^{\\mathrm{GR}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n\nLet's calculate the four required fractional occupancies:\n$1$. For MR at basal concentration:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{MR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{basal}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{MR}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{basal}}} = \\frac{1}{0.5 + 1} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{2}{3}$$\n$2$. For MR at stress concentration:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{MR}}_{\\mathrm{stress}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{stress}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{MR}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{stress}}} = \\frac{30}{0.5 + 30} = \\frac{30}{30.5} = \\frac{60}{61}$$\n$3$. For GR at basal concentration:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{GR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{basal}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{GR}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{basal}}} = \\frac{1}{5 + 1} = \\frac{1}{6}$$\n$4$. For GR at stress concentration:\n$$f^{\\mathrm{GR}}_{\\mathrm{stress}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{stress}}}{K_{d}^{\\mathrm{GR}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{stress}}} = \\frac{30}{5 + 30} = \\frac{30}{35} = \\frac{6}{7}$$\n\nThe results show that MR, with its high affinity (low $K_d$), is substantially occupied even at basal cortisol levels ($f^{\\mathrm{MR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}} \\approx 67\\%$), while GR, with its lower affinity (higher $K_d$), is largely unoccupied at basal levels ($f^{\\mathrm{GR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}} \\approx 17\\%$). This is consistent with the main text.\n\nNow, we calculate the fold-change in occupancy for each receptor, $F^{\\mathrm{MR}}$ and $F^{\\mathrm{GR}}$.\nFor MR:\n$$F^{\\mathrm{MR}} = \\frac{f^{\\mathrm{MR}}_{\\mathrm{stress}}}{f^{\\mathrm{MR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{60}{61}}{\\frac{2}{3}} = \\frac{60}{61} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{30 \\times 3}{61} = \\frac{90}{61}$$\nFor GR:\n$$F^{\\mathrm{GR}} = \\frac{f^{\\mathrm{GR}}_{\\mathrm{stress}}}{f^{\\mathrm{GR}}_{\\mathrm{basal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{6}{7}}{\\frac{1}{6}} = \\frac{6}{7} \\times 6 = \\frac{36}{7}$$\n\nThe fold-change for MR ($F^{\\mathrm{MR}} \\approx 1.475$) is moderate, as it moves closer to full saturation. The fold-change for GR ($F^{\\mathrm{GR}} \\approx 5.14$) is substantially larger, reflecting its role as a sensor for high cortisol concentrations. This differential dynamic is central to stress biology: MRs mediate tonic, homeostatic functions by sensing ambient cortisol levels, while GRs mediate the phasic response to high concentrations of cortisol during stress, orchestrating metabolic, immune, and cognitive adjustments, as well as providing negative feedback to the HPA axis.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R = \\frac{F^{\\mathrm{GR}}}{F^{\\mathrm{MR}}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{F^{\\mathrm{GR}}}{F^{\\mathrm{MR}}} = \\frac{\\frac{36}{7}}{\\frac{90}{61}} = \\frac{36}{7} \\times \\frac{61}{90}$$\nWe can simplify the fraction $\\frac{36}{90}$ by dividing both by their greatest common divisor, 18: $\\frac{36 \\div 18}{90 \\div 18} = \\frac{2}{5}$.\n$$R = \\frac{2}{5} \\times \\frac{61}{7} = \\frac{2 \\times 61}{5 \\times 7} = \\frac{122}{35}$$\nThis ratio is dimensionless. There are no common prime factors between the numerator (2, 61) and denominator (5, 7), so the fraction is in its simplest form. This ratio $R$ quantifies the enhanced responsiveness of GR occupancy compared to MR occupancy when cortisol levels transition from a basal to a stress state.",

The law of mass action for the two binding equilibria provides expressions for the dissociation constants:\n$$ K_{G} = \\frac{[c][G]}{[CG]} $$\n$$ K_{A} = \\frac{[c][A]}{[CA]} $$\nThe concentrations of the protein-bound cortisol complexes, $[CG]$ and $[CA]$, can be rearranged from these equations:\n$$ [CG] = \\frac{c[G]}{K_{G}} $$\n$$ [CA] = \\frac{c[A]}{K_{A}} $$\nThe conservation of mass for the binding proteins states that the total concentration of each protein is the sum of its free and bound forms:\n$$ G_{t} = G + [CG] \\implies G = G_{t} - [CG] $$\n$$ A_{t} = A + [CA] \\implies A = A_{t} - [CA] $$\nSubstitute the expressions for the free protein concentrations, $G$ and $A$, back into the equations for the complex concentrations:\nFor the CBG complex:\n$$ [CG] = \\frac{c(G_{t} - [CG])}{K_{G}} $$\n$$ K_{G}[CG] = cG_{t} - c[CG] $$\n$$ [CG](K_{G} + c) = cG_{t} $$\n$$ [CG] = \\frac{cG_{t}}{K_{G} + c} $$\nFor the albumin complex, by an identical derivation:\n$$ [CA] = \\frac{cA_{t}}{K_{A} + c} $$\nThe total cortisol concentration, $C_{t}$, is the sum of free cortisol and the cortisol bound to each protein:\n$$ C_{t} = c + [CG] + [CA] $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $[CG]$ and $[CA]$ yields the relationship between total cortisol and free cortisol:\n$$ C_{t}(c) = c + \\frac{cG_{t}}{K_{G} + c} + \\frac{cA_{t}}{K_{A} + c} $$\nThis can be written in a factored form:\n$$ C_{t}(c) = c \\left( 1 + \\frac{G_{t}}{K_{G} + c} + \\frac{A_{t}}{K_{A} + c} \\right) $$\nThis is the general relationship required by the problem.\n\nNext, we apply this relationship to compute the total cortisol concentrations before and after oral contraceptive use, for a fixed free cortisol level $c^{\\ast} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n$c^{\\ast} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$G_{t,0} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$A_{t} = 600{,}000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{G} = 30\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$K_{A} = 300{,}000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$\n$f = 2$\n\nThe post-oral contraceptive CBG concentration, $G_{t,1}$, is:\n$G_{t,1} = f \\cdot G_{t,0} = 2 \\cdot 1000\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n\nNow we calculate the pre-oral contraceptive total cortisol, $C_{t,0}$, corresponding to $c^{\\ast}$ by substituting $G_{t} = G_{t,0}$ into the derived equation:\n$$ C_{t,0} = c^{\\ast} \\left( 1 + \\frac{G_{t,0}}{K_{G} + c^{\\ast}} + \\frac{A_{t}}{K_{A} + c^{\\ast}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,0} = 5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1000}{30 + 5} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}000 + 5} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,0} = 5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005} \\right) $$\nThe numerical evaluation proceeds as follows:\n$$ C_{t,0} = 5 \\left( 1 + 28.571428... + 1.999966... \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,0} = 5 \\left( 31.571395... \\right) \\approx 157.856976\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the post-oral contraceptive total cortisol, $C_{t,1}$, corresponding to the same $c^{\\ast}$ by substituting $G_{t} = G_{t,1}$:\n$$ C_{t,1} = c^{\\ast} \\left( 1 + \\frac{G_{t,1}}{K_{G} + c^{\\ast}} + \\frac{A_{t}}{K_{A} + c^{\\ast}} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,1} = 5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2000}{30 + 5} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}000 + 5} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,1} = 5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005} \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,1} = 5 \\left( 1 + 57.142857... + 1.999966... \\right) $$\n$$ C_{t,1} = 5 \\left( 60.142823... \\right) \\approx 300.714119\\,\\mathrm{nM} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative factor $R$, which is the ratio of the post- to pre-oral contraceptive total cortisol cutoffs:\n$$ R = \\frac{C_{t,1}}{C_{t,0}} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005} \\right)}{5 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005} \\right)} $$\nThe factor of $c^{\\ast}=5$ cancels:\n$$ R = \\frac{1 + \\frac{2000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005}}{1 + \\frac{1000}{35} + \\frac{600{,}000}{300{,}005}} $$\n$$ R = \\frac{60.142823...}{31.571395...} \\approx 1.9049773755 $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $1.905$.",
