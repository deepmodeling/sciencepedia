            "introduction": "The journey from a patient's raw performance on neuropsychological tests to a clinical conclusion begins with standardization. Raw scores, such as the time taken to complete a task, are not directly interpretable without being compared to the performance of a healthy population. This exercise will guide you through the fundamental process of converting raw test scores into standardized $z$-scores and then aggregating them to evaluate impairment across different cognitive domains . Mastering this quantitative skill is the bedrock for diagnosing the pattern and severity of cognitive deficits in HAND.",

            "problem": "A person living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) undergoes a neuropsychological evaluation to assess for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. The cognitive battery includes Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A, seconds), Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B, seconds), Digit Symbol Coding (raw total correct), and Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised (HVLT-R) learning (sum across three trials). The observed values are $50$ seconds on TMT-A, $120$ seconds on TMT-B, $45$ on Digit Symbol, and $18$ on HVLT-R learning. Normative reference values (mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$) are: TMT-A $30 \\pm 8$, TMT-B $75 \\pm 20$, Digit Symbol $65 \\pm 10$, HVLT-R learning $24 \\pm 6$.\n\nUse the following foundational definitions:\n- A $z$-score is defined by $z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$, where $x$ is the observed score, $\\mu$ is the normative mean, and $\\sigma$ is the normative standard deviation.\n- For timed measures (where higher times indicate worse performance), compute a direction-corrected $z$-score $z = \\frac{\\mu - x}{\\sigma}$ so that more negative values consistently indicate worse-than-expected performance.\n- Define cognitive domains as follows: processing speed is represented by TMT-A and Digit Symbol; executive functioning is represented by TMT-B; learning is represented by HVLT-R learning.\n- For a domain with multiple measures, define the domain $z$-score as the arithmetic mean of the constituent test $z$-scores.\n- Define impairment at the domain level as present if the domain $z$-score satisfies $z \\leq -1.0$ (that is, at least one standard deviation worse than the normative mean). Impairment is considered present if at least two domains meet this criterion.\n\nCompute the domain-specific $z$-scores for processing speed, executive functioning, and learning, then determine the number of impaired domains.

It is scientifically grounded in standard neuropsychological assessment principles, well-posed with all necessary information and definitions provided, and structured objectively, allowing for a unique and verifiable solution.\n\nThe task is to compute domain-specific $z$-scores for processing speed, executive functioning, and learning, and then to determine the number of domains that meet the criterion for impairment.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the $z$-score for each individual neuropsychological test. The problem specifies two different formulas for the $z$-score depending on the nature of the measure.\n\nFor non-timed measures where a higher score indicates better performance (Digit Symbol, HVLT-R learning), the standard $z$-score is used:\n$$z = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\nwhere $x$ is the observed score, $\\mu$ is the normative mean, and $\\sigma$ is the normative standard deviation.\n\nFor timed measures where a higher score (more time taken) indicates worse performance (TMT-A, TMT-B), a direction-corrected $z$-score is used to ensure that more negative values consistently represent worse performance:\n$$z = \\frac{\\mu - x}{\\sigma}$$\n\nWe will now calculate the $z$-score for each of the four tests.\n\n1.  **Trail Making Test Part A (TMT-A):** This is a timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 50$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 30$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-A}} = 8$.\n    $$z_{\\text{TMT-A}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{TMT-A}} - x_{\\text{TMT-A}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-A}}} = \\frac{30 - 50}{8} = \\frac{-20}{8} = -2.5$$\n\n2.  **Digit Symbol Coding (DSC):** This is a non-timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{DSC}} = 45$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{DSC}} = 65$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{DSC}} = 10$.\n    $$z_{\\text{DSC}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{DSC}} - \\mu_{\\text{DSC}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{DSC}}} = \\frac{45 - 65}{10} = \\frac{-20}{10} = -2.0$$\n\n3.  **Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B):** This is a timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 120$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 75$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-B}} = 20$.\n    $$z_{\\text{TMT-B}} = \\frac{\\mu_{\\text{TMT-B}} - x_{\\text{TMT-B}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{TMT-B}}} = \\frac{75 - 120}{20} = \\frac{-45}{20} = -2.25$$\n\n4.  **Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised (HVLT-R) learning:** This is a non-timed measure.\n    The observed score is $x_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 18$.\n    The normative mean is $\\mu_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 24$.\n    The normative standard deviation is $\\sigma_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = 6$.\n    $$z_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = \\frac{x_{\\text{HVLT-R}} - \\mu_{\\text{HVLT-R}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{HVLT-R}}} = \\frac{18 - 24}{6} = \\frac{-6}{6} = -1.0$$\n\nNext, we calculate the domain-specific $z$-scores based on the problem's definitions.\n\n-   **Processing Speed Domain:** This domain is represented by TMT-A and Digit Symbol. The domain score is the arithmetic mean of the constituent test $z$-scores.\n    $$z_{\\text{processing speed}} = \\frac{z_{\\text{TMT-A}} + z_{\\text{DSC}}}{2} = \\frac{-2.5 + (-2.0)}{2} = \\frac{-4.5}{2} = -2.25$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-2.250$.\n\n-   **Executive Functioning Domain:** This domain is represented solely by TMT-B.\n    $$z_{\\text{executive}} = z_{\\text{TMT-B}} = -2.25$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-2.250$.\n\n-   **Learning Domain:** This domain is represented solely by HVLT-R learning.\n    $$z_{\\text{learning}} = z_{\\text{HVLT-R}} = -1.0$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, this is $-1.000$.\n\nFinally, we determine the number of impaired domains. Impairment at the domain level is defined as a domain $z$-score $z \\leq -1.0$.\n\n-   Processing speed: $z_{\\text{processing speed}} = -2.250$. Since $-2.250 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n-   Executive functioning: $z_{\\text{executive}} = -2.250$. Since $-2.250 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n-   Learning: $z_{\\text{learning}} = -1.000$. Since $-1.000 \\leq -1.0$, this domain is impaired.\n\nAll three domains meet the criterion for impairment. Therefore, the number of impaired domains, $n_{\\text{impaired domains}}$, is $3$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row matrix in the order $[z_{\\text{processing speed}}, z_{\\text{executive}}, z_{\\text{learning}}, n_{\\text{impaired domains}}]$.\nThe values are $[-2.250, -2.250, -1.000, 3]$.",

The patient completes a standardized verbal learning test at baseline and again after $6$ months. The test yields standardized scores (T-scores) with population standard deviation $SD = 10$ and test-retest reliability $r = 0.85$ over $6$ months in stable samples.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in classical test theory, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Reliable Change Index (RCI) for a patient's change in test scores. This requires first deriving the standard error of the difference ($S_{diff}$) from first principles.\n\nAccording to Classical Test Theory (CTT), an observed score ($O$) is composed of a true score ($T$) and a measurement error component ($E$):\n$$O = T + E$$\nKey assumptions of CTT include that the expected value of the error is zero, and that the error term is uncorrelated with the true score. The variance of the observed scores, $SD^2$, is the sum of the true score variance, $\\sigma_T^2$, and the error variance, $\\sigma_E^2$:\n$$SD^2 = \\sigma_T^2 + \\sigma_E^2$$\nTest reliability, $r$, is defined as the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance:\n$$r = \\frac{\\sigma_T^2}{SD^2}$$\nFrom this definition, the error variance can be expressed in terms of the observed score variance and reliability:\n$$\\sigma_E^2 = SD^2 - \\sigma_T^2 = SD^2 - r \\cdot SD^2 = SD^2 (1 - r)$$\nThe standard error of measurement ($SEM$), which is the standard deviation of the error scores, is therefore:\n$$SEM = \\sigma_E = \\sqrt{SD^2 (1 - r)} = SD \\sqrt{1 - r}$$\n\nThe problem requires the standard error for the difference between two observed scores, $O_1$ and $O_2$, taken at two different times. Let the difference score be $D = O_2 - O_1$. The error associated with this difference score is $E_{diff} = E_2 - E_1$, where $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the measurement errors on the first and second occasions, respectively.\n\nThe variance of this difference error, $\\mathrm{Var}(E_{diff})$, is given by:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E_{diff}) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_2 - E_1) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_2) + \\mathrm{Var}(E_1) - 2 \\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2)$$\nThe problem stipulates the assumption of independent and identically distributed measurement errors. Independence implies that the covariance of the errors is zero, $\\mathrm{Cov}(E_1, E_2) = 0$. The identical distribution implies that the error variances are equal, $\\mathrm{Var}(E_1) = \\mathrm{Var}(E_2) = \\sigma_E^2$.\nUnder these assumptions, the variance of the difference error simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(E_{diff}) = \\sigma_E^2 + \\sigma_E^2 = 2\\sigma_E^2$$\nThe standard error of the difference, denoted as $S_{diff}$, is the standard deviation of this distribution:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(E_{diff})} = \\sqrt{2\\sigma_E^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sigma_E$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_E = SD \\sqrt{1 - r}$, we get the formula for the standard error of the difference derived from first principles:\n$$S_{diff} = \\sqrt{2} \\left( SD \\sqrt{1 - r} \\right) = SD \\sqrt{2(1 - r)}$$\n\nThe Reliable Change Index (RCI) is defined as the observed change, adjusted for the expected practice effect ($\\mu_{\\mathrm{PE}}$), divided by the standard error of the difference ($S_{diff}$):\n$$RCI = \\frac{(O_2 - O_1) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{PE}}}{S_{diff}}$$\nSubstituting the derived formula for $S_{diff}$:\n$$RCI = \\frac{(O_2 - O_1) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{PE}}}{SD \\sqrt{2(1 - r)}}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Baseline T-score: $O_1 = 40$\n- Retest T-score: $O_2 = 53$\n- Population standard deviation: $SD = 10$\n- Test-retest reliability: $r = 0.85$\n- Mean practice effect: $\\mu_{\\mathrm{PE}} = 2$\n\nFirst, we calculate the observed change adjusted for the practice effect:\n$$(O_2 - O_1) - \\mu_{\\mathrm{PE}} = (53 - 40) - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11$$\nNext, we calculate the standard error of the difference, $S_{diff}$:\n$$S_{diff} = 10 \\sqrt{2(1 - 0.85)} = 10 \\sqrt{2(0.15)} = 10 \\sqrt{0.3}$$\nNow, we compute the RCI:\n$$RCI = \\frac{11}{10 \\sqrt{0.3}} = \\frac{1.1}{\\sqrt{0.3}}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$RCI \\approx 2.0083155...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the RCI is $2.008$.\n\nConceptually, the RCI functions as a $z$-score. To determine if the change is significant at the two-tailed $95\\%$ confidence level, we compare its absolute value to the critical $z$-value of approximately $1.96$. Since $|RCI| \\approx 2.008 > 1.96$, the patient's improvement is statistically significant.
