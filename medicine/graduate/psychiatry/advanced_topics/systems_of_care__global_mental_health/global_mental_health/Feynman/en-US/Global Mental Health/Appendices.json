            "problem": "A national mental health monitoring program aims to quantify the burden of suicide mortality and depression morbidity for a single calendar year using the Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) framework as operationalized in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies (no age-weighting and no time discounting). In that year, the country records $15{,}000$ deaths from suicide at an average age of $40$ years; the remaining standard life expectancy at age $40$ is $L=35$ years. The same year’s depression burden is characterized by $3{,}000{,}000$ prevalent cases of major depressive disorder, each associated with disability weight $DW=0.15$ and an average episode duration $D=2$ years.\n\nUsing a one-year evaluation horizon and the GBD conceptualization that Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($\\mathrm{DALY}$) is the sum of Years of Life Lost ($\\mathrm{YLL}$) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability ($\\mathrm{YLD}$) due to non-fatal health loss, compute the total $\\mathrm{DALY}$ across these two conditions combined and the proportion of total $\\mathrm{DALY}$ attributable to $\\mathrm{YLD}$ for that year.

            "solution": "The problem will first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity. Upon validation, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n#### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and definitions explicitly provided in the problem statement are as follows:\n-   Framework: Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($\\mathrm{DALY}$) as operationalized in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies.\n-   Assumptions: No age-weighting and no time discounting.\n-   Evaluation period: A single calendar year.\n-   Definition: $\\mathrm{DALY} = \\mathrm{YLL} + \\mathrm{YLD}$, where $\\mathrm{YLL}$ are Years of Life Lost and $\\mathrm{YLD}$ are Years Lived with Disability.\n-   Suicide data:\n    -   Number of deaths from suicide ($N_{suicide}$): $15{,}000$.\n    -   Average age of death: $40$ years.\n    -   Remaining standard life expectancy at age $40$ ($L$): $35$ years.\n    -   Contribution: Suicide deaths contribute only to $\\mathrm{YLL}$.\n-   Depression data:\n    -   Prevalent cases of major depressive disorder ($N_{depr}$): $3{,}000{,}000$.\n    -   Disability weight ($DW$): $0.15$.\n    -   Average episode duration ($D$): $2$ years.\n    -   Contribution: Depression contributes only to $\\mathrm{YLD}$.\n-   Constraint: No overlap or double-counting between the two conditions.\n-   System state: Assumed to be in steady state during the year.\n\n#### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is assessed against the required criteria:\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the well-established and widely used public health metric of Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($\\mathrm{DALY}$), a cornerstone of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) studies. The formulas for calculating $\\mathrm{YLL}$ and $\\mathrm{YLD}$ are standard within this framework. The provided values for life expectancy and disability weight for major depression ($DW=0.15$) are consistent with figures used in epidemiological literature. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters to calculate the total $\\mathrm{DALY}$ and the requested proportion. The objectives are clearly stated. The definitions of $\\mathrm{DALY}$, $\\mathrm{YLL}$, and $\\mathrm{YLD}$ are provided, ensuring a unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free from subjective or opinion-based assertions.\n-   **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained. The clarification that suicide contributes only to $\\mathrm{YLL}$ and depression only to $\\mathrm{YLD}$, with no overlap, removes potential ambiguity. The \"one-year evaluation horizon\" and \"steady state\" assumption provide a clear context for calculation, particularly for $\\mathrm{YLD}$.\n-   **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The provided population statistics, while large, are plausible for a nation's annual burden of disease report. The values are dimensionally consistent (e.g., life expectancy in years).\n\nThe variable for average episode duration, $D=2$ years, requires careful interpretation. Given that the problem specifies a \"one-year evaluation horizon\" and provides the number of \"prevalent cases\" for that year, the standard GBD formula for $\\mathrm{YLD}$ in a given year is the product of prevalence and the disability weight: $\\mathrm{YLD} = \\text{Prevalence} \\times DW$. The duration variable ($D$) is relevant for incidence-based calculations ($\\mathrm{YLD} = \\text{Incidence} \\times DW \\times \\text{Duration}$), but with prevalence data for the specific year, the former approach is correct and standard. The duration datum is therefore extraneous but does not invalidate the problem.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe total disease burden, measured in Disability-Adjusted Life Years ($\\mathrm{DALY}$), is the sum of Years of Life Lost ($\\mathrm{YLL}$) due to premature mortality and Years Lived with Disability ($\\mathrm{YLD}$) due to morbidity.\n$$ \\mathrm{DALY} = \\mathrm{YLL} + \\mathrm{YLD} $$\n\nFirst, we calculate the $\\mathrm{YLL}$ attributable to suicide. The formula for $\\mathrm{YLL}$ is the number of deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death.\n$$ \\mathrm{YLL} = N_{suicide} \\times L $$\nGiven are the number of suicide deaths, $N_{suicide} = 15{,}000$, and the remaining standard life expectancy at the average age of death, $L = 35$ years.\n$$ \\mathrm{YLL} = 15{,}000 \\times 35 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{YLL} = 525{,}000 \\text{ years} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the $\\mathrm{YLD}$ attributable to depression. For a one-year evaluation period, the $\\mathrm{YLD}$ is the number of prevalent cases multiplied by the disability weight associated with the condition.\n$$ \\mathrm{YLD} = N_{depr} \\times DW $$\nGiven are the number of prevalent cases of depression, $N_{depr} = 3{,}000{,}000$, and the disability weight, $DW = 0.15$.\n$$ \\mathrm{YLD} = 3{,}000{,}000 \\times 0.15 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{YLD} = 450{,}000 \\text{ years} $$\n\nThe total $\\mathrm{DALY}$ for the two conditions combined is the sum of the calculated $\\mathrm{YLL}$ and $\\mathrm{YLD}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{DALY}_{total} = \\mathrm{YLL} + \\mathrm{YLD} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DALY}_{total} = 525{,}000 + 450{,}000 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{DALY}_{total} = 975{,}000 \\text{ years} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the proportion of the total $\\mathrm{DALY}$ burden that is attributable to $\\mathrm{YLD}$.\n$$ \\text{Proportion}_{\\mathrm{YLD}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{YLD}}{\\mathrm{DALY}_{total}} $$\n$$ \\text{Proportion}_{\\mathrm{YLD}} = \\frac{450{,}000}{975{,}000} $$\nTo simplify this fraction, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor.\n$$ \\frac{450{,}000}{975{,}000} = \\frac{450}{975} $$\nDividing both by $25$:\n$$ \\frac{450 \\div 25}{975 \\div 25} = \\frac{18}{39} $$\nDividing both by $3$:\n$$ \\frac{18 \\div 3}{39 \\div 3} = \\frac{6}{13} $$\nThe exact proportion is $\\frac{6}{13}$.\n\nThe two required values are the total $\\mathrm{DALY}$, which is $975{,}000$ years, and the proportion of $\\mathrm{DALY}$ attributable to $\\mathrm{YLD}$, which is $\\frac{6}{13}$.",

This exercise explores the practical realities of screening by demonstrating how to calculate and interpret a test's Positive and Negative Predictive Values (PPV and NPV).

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of biostatistics and epidemiology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, precise language. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a student has the disorder, and let $D^c$ be the event that a student does not have the disorder. Let $T^+$ be the event that a student tests positive on the screening questionnaire, and let $T^-$ be the event that a student tests negative.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are translated into probabilistic terms as follows:\nThe prevalence of the disorder, $P(D)$, is given as $0.08$.\n$$P(D) = 0.08$$\nFrom this, the probability of not having the disorder is:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$$\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the presence of the disorder.\n$$\\text{Sensitivity} = P(T^+ | D) = 0.90$$\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the absence of the disorder.\n$$\\text{Specificity} = P(T^- | D^c) = 0.95$$\n\nFrom these definitions, we can derive the probabilities of the complementary events:\nThe False Negative Rate is the probability of a negative test given the presence of the disorder.\n$$P(T^- | D) = 1 - P(T^+ | D) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nThe False Positive Rate is the probability of a positive test given the absence of the disorder.\n$$P(T^+ | D^c) = 1 - P(T^- | D^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe first task is to derive expressions for the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV).\n\nThe Positive Predictive Value, PPV, is the probability that a student has the disorder given a positive test result, $P(D | T^+)$. We use Bayes' theorem for this derivation:\n$$\\text{PPV} = P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test. It can be found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ | D) P(D) + P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence ($P$):\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Sensitivity})(P) + (1 - \\text{Specificity})(1 - P)$$\nTherefore, the general expression for PPV is:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Sensitivity})(P)}{(\\text{Sensitivity})(P) + (1 - \\text{Specificity})(1 - P)}$$\n\nThe Negative Predictive Value, NPV, is the probability that a student does not have the disorder given a negative test result, $P(D^c | T^-)$. We again use Bayes' theorem:\n$$\\text{NPV} = P(D^c | T^-) = \\frac{P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^- | D^c) P(D^c) + P(T^- | D) P(D)$$\nSubstituting the terms for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence ($P$):\n$$P(T^-) = (\\text{Specificity})(1 - P) + (1 - \\text{Sensitivity})(P)$$\nTherefore, the general expression for NPV is:\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{Specificity})(1 - P)}{(\\text{Specificity})(1 - P) + (1 - \\text{Sensitivity})(P)}$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the numerical values for PPV and NPV.\nUsing the derived formula for PPV and the given values:\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{(0.90)(0.08)}{(0.90)(0.08) + (1 - 0.95)(1 - 0.08)} = \\frac{0.072}{0.072 + (0.05)(0.92)}$$\n$$\\text{PPV} = \\frac{0.072}{0.072 + 0.046} = \\frac{0.072}{0.118} \\approx 0.610169...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{PPV} = 0.6102$.\n\nUsing the derived formula for NPV and the given values:\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(0.95)(1 - 0.08)}{(0.95)(1 - 0.08) + (1 - 0.90)(0.08)} = \\frac{(0.95)(0.92)}{(0.95)(0.92) + (0.10)(0.08)}$$\n$$\\text{NPV} = \\frac{0.874}{0.874 + 0.008} = \\frac{0.874}{0.882} \\approx 0.990929...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{NPV} = 0.9909$.\n\nThe final task is to reason about the expected referral burden and its implications. The referral burden is determined by the total proportion of students who screen positive, which is $P(T^+)$.\n$$P(T^+) = (\\text{Sensitivity})(P(D)) + (\\text{False Positive Rate})(P(D^c))$$\n$$P(T^+) = (0.90)(0.08) + (0.05)(0.92) = 0.072 + 0.046 = 0.118$$\nThis calculation indicates that universal screening will result in $11.8\\%$ of the entire student population being referred for a full diagnostic assessment.\n\nThis referral burden has critical implications for care pathways and resource allocation:\n1.  **Volume of Referrals:** A positive screen rate of $11.8\\%$ is substantially higher than the actual disorder prevalence of $8\\%$. For every $1000$ students screened, $118$ will require referral to a trained clinician. This high volume places a significant demand on the diagnostic capacity of the health system.\n\n2.  **Composition of Referrals:** The referrals consist of two groups: True Positives and False Positives.\n    - The rate of True Positives is $P(T^+ \\cap D) = P(T^+|D)P(D) = 0.90 \\times 0.08 = 0.072$, or $7.2\\%$.\n    - The rate of False Positives is $P(T^+ \\cap D^c) = P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c) = 0.05 \\times 0.92 = 0.046$, or $4.6\\%$.\n    The PPV of $0.6102$ means that only about $61\\%$ of the referred students will actually have the disorder. The remaining $39\\%$ are false positives who will consume scarce clinical resources for a diagnostic assessment that ultimately rules out the condition. This represents a considerable inefficiency, a critical issue in a low-resource setting.\n\n3.  **Resource Allocation and System Strain:** The Ministry of Health must allocate resources—primarily trained clinician time—to assess $11.8\\%$ of the school population, not just the $8\\%$ who have the disorder. Failure to provision for this higher-than-prevalence \"caseload\" will create a severe bottleneck in the care pathway. This can lead to long waiting lists for diagnosis, delaying treatment for true positives and causing unnecessary distress for false positives and their families.\n\n4.  **Value of High NPV:** Conversely, the high NPV ($0.9909$) is a major strength of the program. It means that a negative test result is extremely reliable. The program can confidently rule out the disorder for the $P(T^-) = 1 - P(T^+) = 1 - 0.118 = 0.882$, or $88.2\\%$, of students who screen negative. This allows the health system to concentrate its finite follow-up resources on the smaller, albeit imperfectly targeted, group of students who screen positive.\n\nIn summary, while the screening tool is effective at identifying a high proportion of cases (sensitivity $0.90$) and ruling out non-cases (high NPV), its moderate PPV ($0.6102$) in this prevalence setting generates a significant referral burden composed of a large number of false positives. This necessitates careful planning to ensure that the diagnostic tier of the care pathway is sufficiently resourced to handle the volume and avoid systemic bottlenecks.",

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in the concept of the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER), a fundamental metric in health economics used to compare the costs and health outcomes of two or more interventions.\n\nFrom first principles, the ICER is defined as the change in total costs divided by the change in health effects when moving from a comparator intervention to a new intervention. Let the two interventions be $A$ (the comparator) and $B$ (the new intervention). Their respective costs are denoted by $C_A$ and $C_B$, and their respective health effects (effectiveness) are denoted by $E_A$ and $E_B$.
