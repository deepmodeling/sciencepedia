The clinic has adopted a validated panic disorder screener administered at intake as part of routine measurement-based care. In this clinic, the base prevalence (pretest probability) of current panic disorder among new intakes is $0.10$. For the chosen screening threshold, the screener has sensitivity $0.80$ and specificity $0.90$. Let $D$ denote the event that the patient truly has panic disorder, and let $T$ denote the event that the screener result is positive. Sensitivity is defined as $P(T \\mid D)$, specificity is defined as $P(\\overline{T} \\mid \\overline{D})$, and prevalence is $P(D)$.

This reflects the interplay of base rate $0.10$ and test performance; despite good sensitivity and specificity, with a low base prevalence, nearly half of positive screens may be false positives. This suggests that a positive screen should prompt careful diagnostic confirmation (for example, a structured clinical interview) before initiating treatment, aligning with patient values and preferences regarding the risks of overtreatment.\n- If the screener is negative, the probability the patient does not have panic disorder is approximately $0.9759$, leaving a residual probability of $1 - 0.9759 = 0.0241$ that the patient may still have panic disorder despite a negative screen. In SDM, this small residual risk can be discussed; for example, if the patient experiences severe, functionally impairing symptoms or has high concern about missing treatment, the clinician might recommend additional assessment or interim monitoring using ongoing measurement-based tools, whereas if concerns are low, watchful waiting with scheduled re-assessment may be acceptable.\n\nThe requested final output is the $1 \\times 2$ row vector with the positive predictive value first and the negative predictive value second, each as decimals rounded to four significant figures.",

This exercise  bridges the gap between raw data and meaningful interpretation by having you calculate a standardized effect size, Cohen’s $d$.

The primary outcome tracked is the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), administered at baseline and after $8$ weeks. The quality improvement committee pre-specifies a Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) of $5$ PHQ-9 points for mean pre-post improvement at the cohort level to judge clinical significance in routine practice. Assume the observed cohort-level mean pre-post difference is $-4$ PHQ-9 points (negative values reflect improvement), and the pooled standard deviation across the two time points is $6$ PHQ-9 points.\n\nUsing core definitions for standardized mean difference and pooled variability, derive the standardized effect size known as Cohen’s $d$ for this pre-post change, ensuring that the sign of the effect is retained to reflect direction of change. Then compute its numerical value. Based on conventional magnitude interpretations for standardized mean differences, briefly state whether this effect is small, medium, or large, and discuss whether the observed mean change meets the committee’s MCID criterion for clinical significance in MBC-informed SDM.\n\nExpress the final numerical answer for Cohen’s $d$ as a dimensionless real number, rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of Cohen's $d$, a standardized mean difference, for a pre-post study design. Cohen's $d$ quantifies the size of an effect in terms of standard deviation units. The general formula for Cohen's $d$ is the difference between two means divided by a standard deviation.\n\nFor a pre-post or paired-samples design, the mean difference is the change in the mean score from baseline (pre-treatment) to follow-up (post-treatment). Let $\\bar{x}_{\\text{pre}}$ and $\\bar{x}_{\\text{post}}$ represent the mean scores at baseline and after $8$ weeks, respectively. The mean difference is given as:\n$$ \\Delta\\bar{x} = \\bar{x}_{\\text{post}} - \\bar{x}_{\\text{pre}} = -4 $$\nA negative value indicates a reduction in PHQ-9 scores, which corresponds to an improvement in depressive symptoms.\n\nThe standardizer, or the denominator in the Cohen's $d$ calculation, is a measure of standard deviation. The problem explicitly states to use the pooled standard deviation across the two time points, given as:\n$$ s_{\\text{pooled}} = 6 $$\nThis is a standard approach, though other standardizers like the standard deviation of the pre-test scores or the standard deviation of the difference scores are sometimes used. Following the problem's specification, we define Cohen's $d$ as:\n$$ d = \\frac{\\Delta\\bar{x}}{s_{\\text{pooled}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values into this formula:\n$$ d = \\frac{-4}{6} = -\\frac{2}{3} $$\nTo obtain the numerical value, we perform the division and round to three significant figures as requested.\n$$ d \\approx -0.6666... \\approx -0.667 $$\nThe sign is retained to indicate the direction of the change, which is an improvement (a decrease in score).\n\n**Interpretation of Magnitude**\n\nNext, we interpret the magnitude of this effect size. By convention, the magnitude of Cohen's $d$ is often categorized as:\n- Small effect: $|d| \\approx 0.2$\n- Medium effect: $|d| \\approx 0.5$\n- Large effect: $|d| \\approx 0.8$\n\nOur calculated value is $|d| \\approx |-0.667| = 0.667$. This value falls between the thresholds for a medium ($0.5$) and a large ($0.8$) effect. Therefore, the observed pre-post change represents a medium-to-large standardized effect size. For a single classification, it is most accurately described as a medium effect.\n\n**Comparison with MCID**\n\nFinally, we assess whether the observed change meets the pre-specified criterion for clinical significance, the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID). The quality improvement committee defined the MCID as a mean improvement of $5$ PHQ-9 points. \"Improvement\" refers to the magnitude of the change.\n\nThe observed mean change is $-4$ points. The magnitude of this change is:\n$$ |\\Delta\\bar{x}| = |-4| = 4 \\text{ points} $$\nWe compare this observed improvement to the MCID criterion:\n$$ 4 \\text{ points}  5 \\text{ points} $$\nThe magnitude of the observed mean improvement ($4$ points) is less than the required MCID of $5$ points.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, while the statistical effect size (Cohen's $d \\approx -0.667$) is of medium-to-large magnitude, the observed cohort-level mean improvement of $4$ points does not meet the committee's a priori MCID criterion of $5$ points for clinical significance. This highlights a critical distinction in MBC-informed SDM: a statistically notable effect may not necessarily be clinically meaningful as defined by stakeholders.",
