            "introduction": "A cornerstone of recovery-oriented care is its focus on the individual's personal goals and aspirations. While standardized scales are useful, Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) provides a powerful framework for collaboratively setting, weighting, and tracking progress on goals that are uniquely meaningful to the client. This practice  will guide you through the process of converting outcomes from multiple, distinct goals into a single, standardized $T$-score, offering a robust method to quantify personalized recovery trajectories.",

            "problem": "A multidisciplinary community psychiatry team implementing a recovery-oriented care model collaborates with a patient living with schizophrenia to co-create three individualized goals on the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) framework. In GAS, each goal is rated on a five-point scale centered at the expected level of attainment, with the following numerical anchors: much less than expected attainment ($-2$), less than expected attainment ($-1$), expected attainment ($0$), more than expected attainment ($1$), and much more than expected attainment ($2$). The team assigns relative importance weights to the three goals as $w=[1,2,1]$, and at follow-up the attained ratings are $x=[1,0,-1]$.\n\nStarting from the core definitions that (i) recovery-oriented GAS uses a weighted aggregate of goal ratings and (ii) the standardized score should have mean $50$ when the expected level is met and standard deviation $10$ under independence and equal unit variance of goal ratings, derive the closed-form expression for the GAS $T$-score in terms of $w$ and $x$ by standardizing the weighted sum. Then compute the $T$-score for the given $w$ and $x$. Express your final numerical answer as an exact number. After computing, briefly interpret whether the aggregated recovery is above, below, or at the expected trajectory in this recovery-oriented care plan. The final computed value must be reported as a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) $T$-score formula and its application to a specific case. The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nLet the number of goals be $k$. The relative importance weights are denoted by the vector $w = [w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k]$, and the attained outcome ratings are denoted by the vector $x = [x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_k]$. The problem statement provides $k=3$, $w=[1,2,1]$, and $x=[1,0,-1]$. The rating scale for each $x_i$ is centered at $0$, which represents the expected level of attainment.\n\nThe first step is to define the weighted aggregate score. As per the problem's definition (i), this is a weighted sum of the individual goal ratings. Let this score be $S$.\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i$$\nThis can also be expressed as the dot product of the weight and score vectors, $S = w \\cdot x$.\n\nThe next step is to standardize this score. Standardization requires us to determine the mean and standard deviation of $S$ under a set of baseline assumptions. The problem specifies these assumptions: when the expected level of attainment is met for all goals, and the individual goal ratings $x_i$ are treated as independent random variables, each with unit variance.\n\nLet's find the mean (expected value) of $S$, denoted $\\mu_S$, when the expected level of attainment is met. The rating for the expected level is given as $0$. Therefore, the expected value of each individual rating is $E[x_i] = 0$.\nUsing the linearity of the expectation operator:\n$$\\mu_S = E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i E[x_i]$$\nSubstituting $E[x_i] = 0$:\n$$\\mu_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i (0) = 0$$\nThus, the mean of the weighted aggregate score, when performance is at the expected level, is $0$.\n\nNow, let's find the variance of $S$, denoted $\\sigma_S^2$. The problem states that the goal ratings $x_i$ are independent and have equal unit variance, i.e., $\\text{Var}(x_i) = 1$ for all $i$. For independent random variables, the variance of a weighted sum is the weighted sum of the variances, where the weights are squared.\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\text{Var}(S) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\text{Var}(w_i x_i)$$\nSince $w_i$ are constants, $\\text{Var}(w_i x_i) = w_i^2 \\text{Var}(x_i)$.\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2 \\text{Var}(x_i)$$\nSubstituting the unit variance assumption, $\\text{Var}(x_i) = 1$:\n$$\\sigma_S^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2$$\nThe standard deviation of $S$ is the square root of the variance:\n$$\\sigma_S = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}$$\nA standardized score, or $z$-score, is calculated as $z = \\frac{\\text{value} - \\text{mean}}{\\text{standard deviation}}$. For our score $S$, this becomes:\n$$z = \\frac{S - \\mu_S}{\\sigma_S} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i - 0}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}}$$\nThe problem requires a $T$-score, which is a linear transformation of the $z$-score to a distribution with a specified mean and standard deviation. The general form is $T = (\\text{target SD}) \\cdot z + (\\text{target mean})$. The problem specifies a target mean of $50$ and a target standard deviation of $10$.\nSubstituting the expression for $z$ and the target parameters, we derive the closed-form expression for the GAS $T$-score:\n$$T = 10 \\left( \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i x_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i^2}} \\right) + 50$$\nThis is the formula derived by Kiresuk and Sherman for Goal Attainment Scaling.\n\nNow, we compute the $T$-score for the given patient data:\n$$w = [1, 2, 1]$$\n$$x = [1, 0, -1]$$\nFirst, calculate the weighted sum of the scores, $\\sum w_i x_i$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i x_i = (1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) = 1 + 0 - 1 = 0$$\nNext, calculate the sum of the squared weights, $\\sum w_i^2$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i^2 = 1^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6$$\nNow substitute these values into the derived $T$-score formula:\n$$T = 10 \\left( \\frac{0}{\\sqrt{6}} \\right) + 50$$\n$$T = 10(0) + 50 = 50$$\nThe final computed value for the GAS $T$-score is $50$.\n\nFor the final part of the task, we interpret this result. A $T$-score of $50$ is, by definition, the mean of the standardized distribution. In the context of GAS, this mean corresponds precisely to the aggregated expected level of attainment. Although the patient's performance varied across goals—exceeding expectations on the first goal ($x_1=1$), falling short on the third ($x_3=-1$), and meeting expectations on the most heavily weighted second goal ($x_2=0$)—the weighted aggregate score is zero. This indicates that, when accounting for the relative importance of each goal, the positive and negative deviations from the expected outcomes cancel each other out exactly. Therefore, the overall, aggregated recovery for this patient is precisely at the expected trajectory defined in the recovery-oriented care plan.",

            "problem": "A psychiatric rehabilitation program implements Individual Placement and Support (IPS) supported employment within a recovery-oriented care model for adults living with serious mental illness. Fidelity to IPS is assessed with a standardized $25$-item scale in which each item reflects adherence to core recovery principles such as person-centeredness, competitive employment, rapid job search, ongoing support, and integration with mental health services. Each item is scored on a Likert-type rubric from $1$ (low adherence) to $5$ (high adherence). Assume, as is standard for IPS fidelity audits, that items are equally weighted and that the overall fidelity construct can be summarized by the arithmetic mean of the item scores.\n\nYou are provided the following measurement result from a site visit: the sum of the $25$ item ratings is $105$. Fidelity classifications are defined as follows: high if the mean item score satisfies $\\bar{x} \\geq 4.0$, fair if $3.0 \\leq \\bar{x} \\leq 3.9$, and poor if $\\bar{x} < 3.0$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the mean fidelity item score based on provided data and its subsequent classification according to a set of defined thresholds.\n\nFirst, we identify the given quantities from the problem statement. The fidelity assessment is conducted using a scale with $n=25$ items. The sum of the ratings for these $25$ items is given as $105$. We denote the score of the $i$-th item as $x_i$, so the sum can be written as:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{25} x_i = 105\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the overall fidelity construct is summarized by the arithmetic mean of the item scores, denoted by $\\bar{x}$. The definition of the arithmetic mean for a set of $n$ observations is:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, $n=25$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{25} x_i = 105$, into the formula for the mean, we get:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{25} \\times 105\n$$\n\nPerforming the division yields the exact value of the mean item score:\n$$\n\\bar{x} = 4.2\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the qualitative fidelity classification based on the calculated mean score.

            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous solution. The task is to derive an expression for the Number Needed to Treat (NNT) from first principles and then compute its value based on the provided data.\n\nLet $p_I$ represent the probability that an individual achieves clinically meaningful recovery at $12$ months when assigned to the intervention group.\nLet $p_C$ represent the probability that an individual achieves clinically meaningful recovery at $12$ months when assigned to the control group (usual care).\n\nFrom the problem statement, the observed proportions are used as estimates for these probabilities:\n$p_I = 0.55$\n$p_C = 0.40$\n\nThe derivation must be based on the foundational definitions of probability and the linearity of expectation for counts of events across independently treated individuals.\n\nConsider a group of $N$ individuals who are treated with the intervention. For each individual $i$ (where $i$ ranges from $1$ to $N$), let $X_i$ be an indicator random variable such that $X_i=1$ if the individual recovers and $X_i=0$ if they do not. The individuals are considered to be independently treated.\n\nThe probability of recovery for any individual in this group is $P(X_i = 1) = p_I$. By the definition of expected value for a discrete random variable, the expectation of $X_i$ is:\n$$ E[X_i] = (1) \\cdot P(X_i=1) + (0) \\cdot P(X_i=0) = 1 \\cdot p_I + 0 \\cdot (1-p_I) = p_I $$\n\nThe total number of recoveries in the group of $N$ individuals, $S_I$, is the sum of these individual indicator variables: $S_I = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$.\nBy the principle of linearity of expectation, the expected total number of recoveries in the intervention group is:\n$$ E[S_I] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_I = N p_I $$\n\nNow, consider a hypothetical scenario where the same $N$ individuals had instead received usual care. The expected number of recoveries in this control scenario, $E[S_C]$, would be calculated in the same manner, using the probability $p_C$:\n$$ E[S_C] = N p_C $$\n\nThe expected number of *additional* recoveries achieved by treating $N$ people with the intervention compared to usual care is the difference between these two expected values:\n$$ \\Delta E = E[S_I] - E[S_C] = N p_I - N p_C = N(p_I - p_C) $$\nThe term $(p_I - p_C)$ is the risk difference, which represents the absolute increase in recovery probability attributable to the intervention.\n\nThe Number Needed to Treat (NNT) is defined as the number of patients, $N$, that one needs to treat to produce, on average, exactly one additional positive outcome (in this case, one additional recovery).
