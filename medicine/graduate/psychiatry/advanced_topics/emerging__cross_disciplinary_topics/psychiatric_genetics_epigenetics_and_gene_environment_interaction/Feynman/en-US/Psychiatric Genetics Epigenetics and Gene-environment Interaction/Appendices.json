            "introduction": "A primary challenge in psychiatric genetics is distinguishing true genetic associations from spurious ones caused by population stratification. Family-based designs, such as the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT), provide an elegant solution by analyzing allele transmission from heterozygous parents to affected offspring, a process that is robust to ancestral confounding. This exercise  guides you through deriving the score test statistic for the TDT from the binomial likelihood, solidifying your understanding of how Mendelian principles can be leveraged to protect against this common source of bias.",

            "problem": "A psychiatrist investigates the association between a biallelic locus with alleles $A$ and $a$ and a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder in affected offspring. The study uses nuclear family trios and focuses on within-family tests to ensure robustness to ancestral stratification. The foundational assumptions are: (i) Mendelian segregation in meiosis implies that, absent imprinting, a heterozygous parent transmits each allele with probability $1/2$ to any given offspring; (ii) the Central Dogma of molecular biology establishes that genetic transmission does not depend on environmental exposure unless there is a causal biological mechanism that violates Mendelian symmetry, which is assumed absent for this locus; (iii) conditioning on parental genotype removes confounding due to population allele frequency differences because transmission probabilities are defined within families.\n\nTwo ancestral strata are present in the sample, $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$, with markedly different background allele frequencies for $A$ ($0.70$ in $S_{1}$ and $0.30$ in $S_{2}$). A prenatal exposure $E$ (binary: exposed versus unexposed) is recorded, with exposure prevalence $0.50$ in $S_{1}$ and $0.10$ in $S_{2}$. For each trio, transmissions from heterozygous parents are tallied to the affected offspring, stratified by ancestral stratum and exposure status. The observed counts of transmissions of allele $A$ versus allele $a$ from heterozygous parents are:\n\n- In stratum $S_{1}$: among the $E$-exposed families, allele $A$ was transmitted $30$ times and allele $a$ was transmitted $32$ times; among the unexposed families, allele $A$ was transmitted $25$ times and allele $a$ was transmitted $23$ times.\n\n- In stratum $S_{2}$: among the $E$-exposed families, allele $A$ was transmitted $18$ times and allele $a$ was transmitted $17$ times; among the unexposed families, allele $A$ was transmitted $28$ times and allele $a$ was transmitted $27$ times.\n\nStarting from the definition of the binomial likelihood for transmission counts with parameter $p$ denoting the probability that a heterozygous parent transmits allele $A$ to an affected offspring, and the null hypothesis $H_{0}: p = 1/2$, derive the score test statistic for testing $H_{0}$ using the aggregated within-family transmissions across strata and exposure categories. Then, compute the value of this statistic for the data provided and report it.\n\nExpress your final answer as a unitless number rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of a score test statistic for a hypothesis concerning the transmission probability of an allele in family-based genetic association data. The analysis is to be performed on data aggregated across different ancestral strata and exposure groups.\n\nFirst, we formalize the statistical model. The data consist of transmissions from heterozygous parents to their affected offspring. For each such transmission, a parent with genotype $Aa$ can transmit either allele $A$ or allele $a$. Let $p$ be the probability that allele $A$ is transmitted to an affected offspring from a heterozygous parent. The total number of transmissions from heterozygous parents is $N$. Let $T_A$ be the number of times allele $A$ is transmitted, and $T_a$ be the number of times allele $a$ is transmitted, so that $N = T_A + T_a$. Under the assumption of independent transmissions, the random variable $T_A$ follows a binomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $p$, written as $T_A \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p)$.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, as stipulated by Mendelian segregation in the absence of genetic linkage and association, is that the two alleles are transmitted with equal probability. Thus, $H_0: p = 1/2$. The alternative hypothesis, $H_1$, is that there is transmission distortion, i.e., $p \\neq 1/2$.\n\nTo derive the score test statistic, we begin with the log-likelihood function for the parameter $p$. The likelihood function is given by the binomial probability mass function:\n$$L(p; T_A, N) = \\binom{N}{T_A} p^{T_A} (1-p)^{N-T_A}$$\nThe log-likelihood function, $\\ell(p)$, is the natural logarithm of the likelihood:\n$$\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p)) = \\ln\\binom{N}{T_A} + T_A \\ln(p) + (N - T_A) \\ln(1-p)$$\n\nThe score function, $U(p)$, is the first derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter $p$:\n$$U(p) = \\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{T_A}{p} - \\frac{N - T_A}{1-p}$$\nThe score function measures the gradient of the log-likelihood function. Under the null hypothesis, we expect the maximum of the likelihood to be close to the null value $p_0$, so the slope (score) at $p_0$ should be close to zero.\n\nThe Fisher information, $I(p)$, quantifies the amount of information that the data carry about the parameter $p$. It is defined as the negative of the expected value of the second derivative of the log-likelihood function:\n$$I(p) = -E\\left[\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2}\\right]$$\nThe second derivative of the log-likelihood is:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = \\frac{d}{dp}\\left(\\frac{T_A}{p} - \\frac{N - T_A}{1-p}\\right) = -\\frac{T_A}{p^2} - \\frac{N-T_A}{(1-p)^2}$$\nTo find the Fisher information, we take the expectation of the negative of this quantity. The expectation of $T_A$ is $E[T_A] = Np$.\n$$I(p) = -E\\left[-\\frac{T_A}{p^2} - \\frac{N-T_A}{(1-p)^2}\\right] = \\frac{E[T_A]}{p^2} + \\frac{N - E[T_A]}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{Np}{p^2} + \\frac{N-Np}{(1-p)^2}$$\n$$I(p) = \\frac{N}{p} + \\frac{N(1-p)}{(1-p)^2} = \\frac{N}{p} + \\frac{N}{1-p} = \\frac{N(1-p) + Np}{p(1-p)} = \\frac{N}{p(1-p)}$$\n\nThe score test statistic, $S$, is constructed by squaring the score function evaluated at the null value $p_0$ and scaling it by the Fisher information, also evaluated at $p_0$. This statistic follows, asymptotically, a chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom.\n$$S = \\frac{[U(p_0)]^2}{I(p_0)}$$\n\nFor our specific problem, the null hypothesis is $H_0: p = 1/2$, so $p_0 = 1/2$. We evaluate the score function and Fisher information at this value.\n$$U(p_0 = 1/2) = \\frac{T_A}{1/2} - \\frac{N - T_A}{1 - 1/2} = 2T_A - 2(N - T_A) = 4T_A - 2N$$\nSince $N = T_A + T_a$, we can rewrite the score as $U(1/2) = 4T_A - 2(T_A + T_a) = 2T_A - 2T_a$.\n\nThe Fisher information at $p_0 = 1/2$ is:\n$$I(p_0 = 1/2) = \\frac{N}{\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\frac{1}{2})} = \\frac{N}{1/4} = 4N$$\n\nNow, we construct the score test statistic $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{(2T_A - 2T_a)^2}{4N} = \\frac{4(T_A - T_a)^2}{4N} = \\frac{(T_A - T_a)^2}{N}$$\nRecalling that $N = T_A + T_a$, the final form of the statistic is:\n$$S = \\frac{(T_A - T_a)^2}{T_A + T_a}$$\nThis statistic is recognizable as the uncorrected McNemar's test statistic, which is the standard form of the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) statistic.\n\nThe problem requires using the aggregated transmissions across all strata ($S_1, S_2$) and exposure categories ($E$-exposed, unexposed). We sum the counts provided:\nTotal transmissions of allele $A$:\n$T_A = (\\text{transmissions in } S_1, E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_1, \\text{no } E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_2, E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_2, \\text{no } E)$\n$$T_A = 30 + 25 + 18 + 28 = 101$$\n\nTotal transmissions of allele $a$:\n$T_a = (\\text{transmissions in } S_1, E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_1, \\text{no } E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_2, E) + (\\text{transmissions in } S_2, \\text{no } E)$\n$$T_a = 32 + 23 + 17 + 27 = 99$$\n\nThe total number of informative transmissions is $N = T_A + T_a$:\n$$N = 101 + 99 = 200$$\n\nWe can now compute the value of the score test statistic $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{(101 - 99)^2}{200} = \\frac{2^2}{200} = \\frac{4}{200} = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$S = 0.02000$$\nThis value of the statistic is very small, suggesting that, for the aggregated data, there is no statistically significant evidence of transmission distortion from that predicted by Mendelian inheritance. The observed counts of $101$ and $99$ are very close to the expected counts of $100$ and $100$ under the null hypothesis.",

The entire process must be grounded in the provided definitions.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the RERI Expression\n\nThe RERI is a measure of interaction on the additive scale, specifically, as a deviation from the additivity of risk differences. Let $p_{ge} = \\Pr(Y=1 \\mid G=g, E=e)$ be the risk of a major depressive episode for individuals with genotype $g \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and environmental exposure $e \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

The expected risk under this additive model, denoted $p_{11}^{\\text{add}}$, would be the baseline risk plus this combined risk difference:\n$$\np_{11}^{\\text{add}} = p_{00} + RD_{G} + RD_{E} = p_{00} + (p_{10} - p_{00}) + (p_{01} - p_{00}) = p_{10} + p_{01} - p_{00}\n$$\nInteraction on the additive scale is defined as the deviation of the observed risk in the doubly exposed group, $p_{11}$, from this expected additive risk.
