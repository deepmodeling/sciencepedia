This exercise demystifies the structure of gambling by applying the fundamental concept of expected value, $E[X]$, to a game of American roulette.

            "problem": "A patient with Gambling Disorder is playing American roulette as part of a controlled behavioral economics assessment. The American roulette wheel has 38 pockets: 18 red numbers, 18 black numbers, and 2 green zeros. Consider the even-money bet on red: on a single spin, if the ball lands on red, the player’s net change in wealth is $b$ dollars; otherwise, the net change is $-b$ dollars, where $b$ is the stake per spin. The sessions are structured so that spins are independent and identically distributed.\n\nStarting from the definition of expected value $E[X] = \\sum x_{i} p_{i}$ and the Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN), which states that the sample mean converges almost surely to the expected value for independent, identically distributed random variables, derive the expected value per spin and the corresponding house edge defined as the expected fractional loss of stake per spin. Then, using these derivations, compute the expected cumulative financial loss for the following assessment parameters: the stake per spin is $b = 100$ dollars, the patient plays for $t = 4$ hours, and the average spin rate is $r = 48$ spins per hour. Assume independence across spins and a fair wheel with the probabilities determined by its physical composition.\n\nExpress the final expected cumulative loss in dollars and round your answer to four significant figures. Do not use a percentage sign; any fractional rates should be expressed as decimals or exact fractions where appropriate.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Game: American roulette\n- Wheel composition: 38 total pockets\n- Pocket distribution: 18 red, 18 black, 2 green\n- Bet: Even-money bet on red\n- Stake per spin: $b$ dollars\n- Net change for a win (red): $+b$\n- Net change for a loss (not red): $-b$\n- Spins are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).\n- Definition of expected value: $E[X] = \\sum x_{i} p_{i}$\n- Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) is mentioned as a guiding principle.\n- Calculation parameters:\n  - Stake per spin, $b = 100$ dollars\n  - Duration of play, $t = 4$ hours\n  - Spin rate, $r = 48$ spins per hour\n- Required assumptions: Independence across spins, fair wheel.\n- Final output requirement: Expected cumulative financial loss in dollars, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated for validity:\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is a standard application of probability theory to a well-defined game of chance. The concepts of expected value, i.i.d. random variables, and the Law of Large Numbers are fundamental principles of mathematics and statistics. The physical model of the roulette wheel is consistent with standard descriptions. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data for the calculation are provided: the probabilities of outcomes (derivable from the wheel composition), the payoffs for each outcome, the stake, and the total number of trials (derivable from the duration and spin rate). A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in objective, quantitative language. The context of a behavioral assessment for Gambling Disorder serves as a realistic framing but does not introduce subjectivity or non-formalizable elements into the mathematical task.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nLet $X$ be a random variable representing the net change in wealth from a single spin with a stake of $b$ dollars on red. The American roulette wheel has 38 equally likely pockets: 18 red, 18 black, and 2 green.\n\nThe possible outcomes for $X$ are:\n1.  A win, where the ball lands on a red pocket. The net change is $x_1 = +b$. The probability of this event, $p_1$, is the ratio of red pockets to the total number of pockets:\n    $$p_1 = P(X = +b) = \\frac{18}{38} = \\frac{9}{19}$$\n2.  A loss, where the ball lands on a black or green pocket. The net change is $x_2 = -b$. The probability of this event, $p_2$, is the ratio of non-red pockets to the total:\n    $$p_2 = P(X = -b) = \\frac{18 + 2}{38} = \\frac{20}{38} = \\frac{10}{19}$$\n\nThe expected value of the net change per spin, $E[X]$, is derived using the definition $E[X] = \\sum x_{i} p_{i}$:\n$$E[X] = x_1 p_1 + x_2 p_2 = (+b)\\left(\\frac{9}{19}\\right) + (-b)\\left(\\frac{10}{19}\\right)$$\n$$E[X] = b\\left(\\frac{9 - 10}{19}\\right) = b\\left(-\\frac{1}{19}\\right) = -\\frac{b}{19}$$\n\nThis negative expected value indicates an average loss over many spins.\n\nThe problem defines the house edge as the expected fractional loss of stake per spin. The expected loss is $-E[X]$.\n$$\\text{House Edge} = \\frac{-E[X]}{b} = \\frac{-(-b/19)}{b} = \\frac{b/19}{b} = \\frac{1}{19}$$\nAs a decimal, this is $\\frac{1}{19} \\approx 0.05263$, or $5.263\\%$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the spins are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Let $X_i$ be the outcome of the $i$-th spin for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. The total number of spins, $n$, is calculated from the given duration $t$ and spin rate $r$:\n$$n = t \\times r = (4 \\text{ hours}) \\times (48 \\text{ spins/hour}) = 192 \\text{ spins}$$\n\nThe total cumulative financial outcome after $n$ spins is the sum $S_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i$. The Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN) states that the average outcome per spin, $\\frac{S_n}{n}$, converges to the expected value $E[X]$. This justifies using the expected value to predict the long-run average outcome. The expected cumulative outcome is found by the linearity of expectation:\n$$E[S_n] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nSince the spins are i.i.d., $E[X_i] = E[X]$ for all $i$. Thus:\n$$E[S_n] = n \\cdot E[X]$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $b = 100$ dollars and $n = 192$ spins.\nThe expected value per spin is:\n$$E[X] = -\\frac{100}{19} \\text{ dollars}$$\nThe expected cumulative outcome over $n=192$ spins is:\n$$E[S_{192}] = 192 \\times \\left(-\\frac{100}{19}\\right) = -\\frac{19200}{19} \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the expected cumulative financial loss. A loss is a positive value, which is the negative of the expected cumulative outcome (since the outcome is negative).\n$$\\text{Expected Cumulative Loss} = -E[S_{192}] = - \\left(-\\frac{19200}{19}\\right) = \\frac{19200}{19} \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures:\n$$\\frac{19200}{19} \\approx 1010.5263157...$$\nTo round to four significant figures, we examine the number $1010.52...$. The first four significant digits are $1$, $0$, $1$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $5$, which requires rounding up the fourth digit. The fourth digit, $0$, is rounded up to $1$.\n$$\\text{Rounded Expected Cumulative Loss} \\approx 1011 \\text{ dollars}$$",

            "problem": "A 34-year-old accountant meets diagnostic criteria for Gambling Disorder per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). You conduct a functional analysis using Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence (ABC) mapping grounded in operant learning principles, specifically that gambling is maintained by a variable-ratio (VR) reinforcement schedule and occasioned by identifiable antecedent cues. Over 4 weeks of ecological momentary sampling, the following high-risk contexts are observed:\n\n- Payday Fridays: At 09:00 the client receives a paycheck of $2,000. Historical data show a conditional probability of gambling within $\\leq 2$ hours of $P_{\\text{payday}} = 0.8$ with a mean spend of $400 per episode.\n- Workday lunch breaks: On Mon–Thu between 12:30 and 13:00, smartphone notifications from two betting applications occur, with conditional probability $P_{\\text{lunch}} = 0.4$ and mean spend of $50 per episode.\n- Evening commute: On 4 evenings per week, the client walks past a high-street sportsbook, with conditional probability $P_{\\text{commute}} = 0.3$ and mean spend of $100 per episode.\n- Late Saturday nights: After consuming $\\geq 3$ alcoholic drinks, there is a conditional probability $P_{\\text{late}} = 0.5$ of online gambling with a mean spend of $250.\n\nAssume the expected count of weekly gambling episodes can be conceptualized as the sum over contexts of exposure frequency multiplied by the conditional probability of gambling in that context, and that stimulus control seeks to reduce either exposure frequency or the conditional probability by altering antecedents or access (response effort), without relying on momentary self-control.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem from clinical psychology, framed quantitatively, and requires a rigorous, principle-based solution. The task is to identify the most effective intervention strategy for a client with Gambling Disorder, based on a provided functional analysis and the principles of stimulus control.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens**\n\n*   **Diagnosis**: Gambling Disorder per DSM-5.\n*   **Client Profile**: 34-year-old accountant.\n*   **Analytical Framework**: Functional analysis (Antecedent-Behavior-Consequence or ABC mapping) based on operant learning principles.\n*   **Core Behavioral Mechanism**: Gambling maintained by a variable-ratio (VR) reinforcement schedule, occasioned by specific antecedent cues.\n*   **Objective**: To select the intervention option that implements stimulus control strategies to yield the largest expected reduction in weekly gambling episodes. Stimulus control is defined as reducing exposure frequency to antecedents or reducing the conditional probability of the behavior by altering antecedents or increasing response effort.\n*   **Constraint**: The strategy should not rely on \"momentary self-control.\"\n*   **Client Preferences/Willingness**: Preserve work functioning and timely bill payments; willing to involve his partner and change routines.\n*   **Quantitative Model**: Expected weekly episodes $E = \\sum_i f_i \\cdot P_i$, where $f_i$ is the weekly frequency of exposure to context $i$ and $P_i$ is the conditional probability of gambling in that context.\n*   **Baseline Data (High-Risk Contexts)**:\n    1.  **Payday Fridays ($i=1$)**: $f_1 = 1$ exposure/week. Antecedent: receipt of $2,000 paycheck. Conditional probability $P_1 = P_{\\text{payday}} = 0.8$.\n    2.  **Workday Lunches ($i=2$)**: $f_2 = 4$ exposures/week (Mon-Thu). Antecedent: smartphone notifications from betting apps. Conditional probability $P_2 = P_{\\text{lunch}} = 0.4$.\n    3.  **Evening Commute ($i=3$)**: $f_3 = 4$ exposures/week. Antecedent: walking past a sportsbook. Conditional probability $P_3 = P_{\\text{commute}} = 0.3$.\n    4.  **Late Saturday Nights ($i=4$)**: $f_4 = 1$ exposure/week. Antecedent: consuming $\\geq 3$ alcoholic drinks. Conditional probability $P_4 = P_{\\text{late}} = 0.5$.\n\n**1.2. Validation**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is well-grounded in evidence-based practices of clinical psychology and psychiatry. The use of functional analysis, operant conditioning principles (stimulus control, response effort), and ABC mapping for treating addictive behaviors is standard. The DSM-5 is the authoritative diagnostic manual. The scenario is clinically realistic.\n*   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data and a clear, quantitative objective function ($E = \\sum f_i \\cdot P_i$) to evaluate the options. The constraints are explicit. A unique, optimal solution among the choices can be determined.\n*   **Objectivity**: The problem statement is objective and uses precise clinical and behavioral terminology. There are no subjective or ambiguous elements that would impede a rigorous analysis.\n\n**1.3. Verdict**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe core task is to calculate the expected reduction in weekly gambling episodes for each option. The reduction is given by $\\Delta E = E_{\\text{baseline}} - E_{\\text{option}}$.\n\n**2.1. Calculate Baseline Expected Weekly Episodes ($E_{\\text{baseline}}$)**\n\nUsing the provided formula and data:\n$$E_{\\text{baseline}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} f_i \\cdot P_i = (f_1 \\cdot P_1) + (f_2 \\cdot P_2) + (f_3 \\cdot P_3) + (f_4 \\cdot P_4)$$\n$$E_{\\text{baseline}} = (1 \\cdot 0.8) + (4 \\cdot 0.4) + (4 \\cdot 0.3) + (1 \\cdot 0.5)$$\n$$E_{\\text{baseline}} = 0.8 + 1.6 + 1.2 + 0.5 = 4.1$$\nThe baseline expected number of gambling episodes per week is $4.1$.\n\n**2.2. Evaluate Each Option**\n\nThe evaluation of each option involves determining how its proposed interventions modify the frequencies ($f_i$) and conditional probabilities ($P_i$) for each of the four contexts.\n\n**Option A: Evaluation**\n\n*   **Interventions**: Delete betting apps & enable DND; keep existing finances; keep commute route; self-exclude from one sportsbook; check-in text with a friend.\n*   **Impact on Parameters**:\n    *   **Payday**: Financial access is unchanged. A check-in text is a weak intervention, not a primary stimulus control method. We can conservatively assume $P_1$ remains high, e.g., $P_1' \\approx 0.8$. No change.\n    *   **Lunch**: Deleting the apps removes the primary antecedent. This is effective stimulus control. $P_2' \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Commute**: Self-exclusion at the specific sportsbook encountered on the commute increases response effort to near infinity for that venue. This is effective. $P_3' \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Late Night**: No interventions address this context. $P_4' = 0.5$.\n*   **New Expected Episodes ($E_A$)**:\n    $$E_A = (1 \\cdot 0.8) + (4 \\cdot 0) + (4 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 0.5) = 0.8 + 0 + 0 + 0.5 = 1.3$$\n*   **Expected Reduction ($\\Delta E_A$)**:\n    $$\\Delta E_A = 4.1 - 1.3 = 2.8$$\n\n**Option B: Evaluation**\n\n*   **Interventions**: This is a comprehensive, multi-layered plan including bank-level gambling block (MCC), radical financial restructuring with partner involvement, device-level DNS blocking, app deletion, lunch routine change, commute route change, and broad multi-operator self-exclusion.\n*   **Impact on Parameters**: These interventions systematically target every identified antecedent and dramatically increase response effort for all forms of gambling.\n    *   **Payday ($P_1'$)**: The combination of the MCC block and moving the paycheck to a restricted account with no direct client access makes large-scale gambling impossible. $P_1' \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Lunch ($P_2'$)**: Deleting apps, DNS blocking, and, most importantly, changing the lunch routine to an incompatible activity effectively eliminates this risk. $P_2' \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Commute ($f_3'$)**: Changing the commute route to avoid the sportsbook removes the antecedent entirely. The exposure frequency becomes zero. $f_3' = 0$.\n    *   **Late Night ($P_4'$)**: The combination of financial controls (partner holding card, $20 daily limit), MCC bank block, and device-level DNS blocking makes online gambling after drinking virtually impossible. $P_4' \\approx 0$.\n*   **New Expected Episodes ($E_B$)**:\n    $$E_B = (1 \\cdot 0) + (4 \\cdot 0) + (0 \\cdot 0.3) + (1 \\cdot 0) = 0$$\n*   **Expected Reduction ($\\Delta E_B$)**:\n    $$\\Delta E_B = 4.1 - 0 = 4.1$$\n*   **Constraints**: The plan explicitly preserves bill-paying function and respects the client's stated willingness to involve his partner and change routines.\n\n**Option C: Evaluation**\n\n*   **Interventions**: Cognitive restructuring; vague goal-setting; no changes to routines or finances; reliance on willpower.\n*   **Impact on Parameters**: This option explicitly makes no changes to the antecedents or response effort. It relies on cognitive changes and willpower, which violates the problem's constraint (\"not relying on momentary self-control\") and is not a stimulus control strategy. Therefore, for the purpose of this analysis, no parameters are changed. $f_i' = f_i$ and $P_i' = P_i$.\n*   **New Expected Episodes ($E_C$)**:\n    $$E_C = E_{\\text{baseline}} = 4.1$$\n*   **Expected Reduction ($\\Delta E_C$)**:\n    $$\\Delta E_C = 4.1 - 4.1 = 0$$\n\n**Option D: Evaluation**\n\n*   **Interventions**: Temporary ($7$-day) app self-exclusion; relying on supportive texts; keeping existing finances; avoiding cash but not cards.\n*   **Impact on Parameters**: This is a collection of weak or temporary measures.\n    *   **Payday**: As in A, supportive texts are a weak intervention. $P_1' \\approx 0.8$.\n    *   **Lunch**: The $7$-day exclusion is effective but not a durable strategy. Extrapolating a temporary fix as a long-term strategy is problematic, but for the sake of comparison, we assume $P_2' \\approx 0$.\n    *   **Commute**: Avoiding cash but keeping cards is a weak barrier, as most venues accept cards. $P_3$ might be slightly reduced, but not to zero. Let's make a generous assumption that it is halved: $P_3' = 0.5 \\cdot 0.3 = 0.15$.\n    *   **Late Night**: No effective interventions, as the client retains full access to funds via cards. $P_4' = 0.5$.\n*   **New Expected Episodes ($E_D$)**:\n    $$E_D = (1 \\cdot 0.8) + (4 \\cdot 0) + (4 \\cdot 0.15) + (1 \\cdot 0.5) = 0.8 + 0 + 0.6 + 0.5 = 1.9$$\n*   **Expected Reduction ($\\Delta E_D$)**:\n    $$\\Delta E_D = 4.1 - 1.9 = 2.2$$\n\n### Step 3: Option-by-Option Analysis and Conclusion\n\n*   **A**: This option implements some valid stimulus control strategies, targeting the lunch and commute contexts effectively. However, it fails to address the powerful financial antecedent on payday and the high-risk late-night context, leaving significant vulnerabilities. The expected reduction in episodes is $\\approx 2.8$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B**: This option presents a comprehensive and robust plan that is perfectly consistent with stimulus control principles. It systematically targets every single high-risk context identified in the functional analysis using multiple, powerful interventions (antecedent removal, response cost/effort). The quantitative analysis shows it yields the largest possible reduction in expected episodes ($\\approx 4.1$). It also adheres to all stated client constraints and preferences. **Correct**.\n\n*   **C**: This option is fundamentally flawed. It proposes cognitive therapy and reliance on willpower, which are explicitly outside the scope of stimulus control as defined in the problem and violate a core constraint. It produces no immediate reduction in expected episodes according to the model. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D**: This option is weak and not durable. Its main digital intervention is temporary, and its financial and environmental controls are easily circumvented. It produces a smaller reduction in expected episodes ($\\approx 2.2$) than both options A and B. **Incorrect**.\n\nComparing the expected reductions:\n*   $\\Delta E_B \\approx 4.1$\n*   $\\Delta E_A \\approx 2.8$\n*   $\\Delta E_D \\approx 2.2$\n*   $\\Delta E_C \\approx 0$\n\nOption B is unequivocally superior, both in terms of its adherence to the specified therapeutic principles (stimulus control derived from functional analysis) and in its quantitative effectiveness at reducing the target behavior.",

            "problem": "You are to implement a cohort Markov model for Gambling Disorder states to estimate expected total costs and expected total Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over $5$ annual cycles under two strategies. The states are $A$ (active gambling disorder), $R$ (remission), and $L$ (relapse). For each strategy, the evolution of the cohort is governed by a time-homogeneous Markov chain with the Markov property and a $3 \\times 3$ transition probability matrix whose rows sum to $1$, with state order $\\{A,R,L\\}$. The initial state distribution vector is specified, and it must sum to $1$. Per-state annual costs are expressed in United States Dollars (USD), and per-state annual utilities are expressed in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY), both treated as expected values conditional on state occupancy. A constant annual discount rate is applied to both costs and QALYs. The program must compute expected totals using end-of-cycle state occupancy, with cycle index $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, discount factor applied as $(1+d)^{-t}$, and sum across cycles. Strategy $1$ (usual care) uses its transition matrix without additional program costs. Strategy $2$ (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)) uses its transition matrix and adds a constant per-cycle program cost to the expected cost each year regardless of state (interpretable as a per-person program overhead); this constant is specified for each test case.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- The Markov property: future state distribution depends only on the current state distribution and the transition probabilities, not on prior history.\n- Expected value and linearity of expectation for additive processes over cycles.\n- Standard present value discounting with a constant annual rate applied multiplicatively to each cycle’s expected quantity.\n\nYour program should:\n- For each strategy $s$, evolve the cohort distribution over $n=5$ annual cycles, using the specified transition matrix for that strategy.\n- In each cycle $t$, compute the expected cost as the dot product of the end-of-cycle state distribution and the per-state cost vector.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a cohort Markov model to evaluate two strategies for managing Gambling Disorder: usual care (UC) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). The model will estimate the total discounted costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) over a period of $n=5$ annual cycles. The analysis is based on a three-state model: $A$ (active gambling disorder), $R$ (remission), and $L$ (relapse).\n\nThe core of the model is a discrete-time, time-homogeneous Markov chain. The state of the cohort at any time is described by a state distribution vector, $x_t = [P(S_t=A), P(S_t=R), P(S_t=L)]$, where $S_t$ is the state at the end of cycle $t$. The initial state distribution at time $t=0$ is given as $x_0$.\n\nThe evolution of the cohort's state distribution is governed by a strategy-specific $3 \\times 3$ transition probability matrix, $P$. According to the Markov property, the state distribution at the end of cycle $t$ (time $t$) is calculated from the distribution at the end of the previous cycle (time $t-1$) by the matrix multiplication $x_t = x_{t-1} P$. Iterating this from the initial state $x_0$, the distribution at the end of cycle $t$ is $x_t = x_0 P^t$. For the implementation, we will use the iterative update $x_{t} = x_{t-1} P$ within a loop for $t$ from $1$ to $5$.\n\nFor each cycle $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, we calculate the expected outcomes. The problem specifies using the end-of-cycle state occupancy, meaning we use the distribution $x_t$ to calculate costs and QALYs for the $t$-th cycle. The per-state annual costs are given by a vector $c = [c_A, c_R, c_L]$, and per-state annual utilities (QALYs) are given by a vector $u = [u_A, u_R, u_L]$.\n\nFor the usual care (UC) strategy, with transition matrix $P_{\\text{UC}}$, the state distribution at the end of cycle $t$ is $x_t^{\\text{UC}} = x_0 P_{\\text{UC}}^t$. The expected outcomes for cycle $t$ are:\n- Expected Cost: $E[C_{t, \\text{UC}}] = x_t^{\\text{UC}} \\cdot c$, where $\\cdot$ denotes the dot product.\n- Expected QALYs: $E[Q_{t, \\text{UC}}] = x_t^{\\text{UC}} \\cdot u$.\n\nFor the CBT strategy, with transition matrix $P_{\\text{CBT}}$, the state distribution is $x_t^{\\text{CBT}} = x_0 P_{\\text{CBT}}^t$. This strategy incurs an additional constant program cost, $k$, per cycle. The expected outcomes for cycle $t$ are:\n- Expected Cost: $E[C_{t, \\text{CBT}}] = (x_t^{\\text{CBT}} \\cdot c) + k$.\n- Expected QALYs: $E[Q_{t, \\text{CBT}}] = x_t^{\\text{CBT}} \\cdot u$.\n\nFuture costs and QALYs are discounted to their present values using a constant annual discount rate, $d$. The discount factor for outcomes in cycle $t$ is $(1+d)^{-t}$. The total discounted cost for a strategy $s$ is the sum of discounted expected costs over the $n=5$ cycles:\n$$ C_s = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{E[C_{t,s}]}{(1+d)^t} $$\nSimilarly, the total discounted QALYs for strategy $s$ is:\n$$ Q_s = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{E[Q_{t,s}]}{(1+d)^t} $$\n\nThe algorithm proceeds by iterating from $t=1$ to $n=5$. In each iteration, it first updates the state distribution vector, then computes the expected cost and QALYs for that cycle, including the extra cost $k$ for the CBT strategy. These cycle-specific outcomes are then discounted and added to running totals. This process is performed for both the UC and CBT strategies for each test case. The final totals for costs and QALYs are rounded to $4$ decimal places and formatted as specified. `NumPy` is used for efficient handling of vector and matrix operations.",
