            "problem": "A $68$-year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer on a hospital-based palliative care service is evaluated by the psychiatry consult team. Over the past $30$ days she reports a daily wish “to not wake up.” She denies any intent to harm herself.

            "solution": "The user has provided a clinical problem in psychiatry requiring the application of the Columbia–Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and principles of suicide risk stratification.\n\n### Step 1: Validation of the Problem Statement\n\nThe problem is a well-defined clinical vignette. I will extract the explicit givens to validate its integrity.\n\n**Givens:**\n- **Patient Profile:** A $68$-year-old woman.\n- **Primary Diagnosis:** Metastatic pancreatic cancer.\n- **Clinical Setting:** Hospital-based palliative care service.\n- **Evaluation Period:** The past $30$ days.\n- **Reported Ideation:**\n    1.  A daily wish “to not wake up.”\n    2.  On two occasions, thoughts of overdosing on her medications, with brief consideration of how she might do this.\n- **Reported Intent and Behavior:**\n    1.  Denies any intent to harm herself.\n    2.  No preparatory behaviors.\n    3.  No history of suicide attempts, or aborted/interrupted attempts.\n- **Protective Factors and Mitigating Circumstances:**\n    1.  Spouse keeps all medications and sharps locked.\n    2.  Engages in meaning-centered psychotherapy.\n    3.  Values time with her grandchildren.\n    4.  No firearms in the home.\n    5.  Recent improvement in pain control.\n- **Co-occurring Distress:** Existential distress and demoralization.\n- **Task:**\n    1.  Determine the single highest C-SSRS ideation severity category in the past month.\n    2.  Determine an appropriate risk stratification.\n    3.  Determine an appropriate inpatient observation frequency and post-discharge follow-up plan.\n\n**Validation:**\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in standard psychiatric and palliative care clinical practice. The C-SSRS is a validated and widely used instrument for assessing suicidality. The concepts of risk stratification, protective factors, and patient observation levels are core tenets of patient safety in psychiatry. The scenario is clinically realistic.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a detailed case with sufficient information to apply the C-SSRS framework and principles of risk assessment. The question is specific and asks for a determination based on the provided data.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement is objective, presenting a clinical history without subjective or biased language.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem statement is valid. It is a standard clinical reasoning problem that can be solved by applying a defined classificatory scheme (the C-SSRS) and established principles of risk management.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution requires a two-part analysis: first, applying the C-SSRS definitions to determine the highest ideation category, and second, integrating this finding with all other clinical data to determine the overall risk level and corresponding management plan.\n\n**Part 1: C-SSRS Ideation Severity Category**\n\nThe C-SSRS for suicidal ideation consists of a hierarchy of $5$ categories. The highest category endorsed by the patient in the look-back period is recorded.\n\n1.  **Category 1: Wish to be Dead.** This involves passive thoughts of death, such as \"I wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.\" The patient reports a daily wish “to not wake up.” Therefore, she meets the criteria for Category $1$.\n\n2.  **Category 2: Non-specific Active Suicidal Thoughts.** This involves thoughts of suicide but without consideration of a method. For example, \"I've thought about killing myself.\"\n\n3.  **Category 3: Active Suicidal Ideation with Any Methods (not plan), without Intent to Act.** The patient has thoughts of a method of suicide but denies any intent to act on these thoughts. The problem states the patient \"thought about overdosing on her own medications and briefly considered how she might do this,\" but she also \"denies any intent to harm herself\" and \"again denies intent.\" This presentation maps precisely to the definition of Category $3$.\n\n4.  **Category 4: Active Suicidal Ideation with Some Intent to Act, without Specific Plan.** This requires that the patient has some level of intent to act on their thoughts, even if a plan is not fully formed. The patient explicitly and repeatedly denies intent. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for Category $4$.\n\n5.  **Category 5: Active Suicidal Ideation with Specific Plan and Intent.** This requires both a specific plan (details of method, time, place) and intent to act. The patient has neither. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for Category $5$.\n\nThe highest ideation severity category met by the patient in the past month is **Category 3**.\n\n**Part 2: Risk Stratification and Management Plan**\n\nRisk stratification is not based solely on the C-SSRS score but integrates it with the patient's complete clinical picture, including risk factors, protective factors, and clinical context.\n\n*   **Risk Factors:**\n    *   C-SSRS ideation score of $3$ (active thoughts with method).\n    *   Serious medical illness (metastatic pancreatic cancer), which is a major risk factor.\n    *   Existential distress and demoralization.\n    *   Past triggers (pain, insomnia) that led to increased ideation.\n\n*   **Protective Factors:**\n    *   Explicit and repeated denial of intent.\n    *   No preparatory behaviors or history of attempts.\n    *   Strong social support and immediate safety measures (spouse secures means).\n    *   Engagement in psychotherapy (therapeutic alliance).\n    *   Identified reasons for living (values time with grandchildren).\n    *   Recent improvement in a key stressor (pain control).\n\n**Overall Risk Assessment:**\n*   A \"high\" risk assessment is not warranted. High risk implies immediate danger, often with intent, a plan, and/or a recent attempt. This patient has strong contraindications for high risk, most notably the lack of intent and the presence of robust protective factors.\n*   A \"low\" risk assessment is also not appropriate. Active ideation with a method (C-SSRS $3$) is clinically significant and elevates a patient's risk beyond \"low,\" which is typically reserved for passive ideation (C-SSRS $1$) or no ideation.\n*   A \"**moderate**\" risk assessment is the most accurate. It acknowledges the seriousness of active ideation with a method while accounting for the very strong protective factors that mitigate the immediate risk of acting on these thoughts.\n\n**Management Plan for Moderate Risk:**\n*   **Inpatient Observation:**\n    *   $1$:$1$ constant observation and checks every $15$ minutes are reserved for high/imminent risk. These are overly restrictive and not indicated.\n    -   Routine checks (e.g., every $8$ hours) are for low-risk patients and would be insufficient.\n    -   Checks every **$30$ minutes** provide a level of monitoring appropriate for moderate risk, ensuring safety without being excessively intrusive, which is particularly important in a palliative care setting.\n*   **Post-Discharge Follow-up:**\n    *   Urgent follow-up (within $24$ hours) is for high risk.\n    *   Delayed follow-up (e.g., visit in $4$ weeks) is for low risk.\n    *   For moderate risk, a safety plan must ensure a prompt and safe transition to outpatient care. Standard practice calls for follow-up contact within **$24$–$72$ hours** to confirm safety and a scheduled outpatient visit within **$1$ week** to continue care.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation:**\nThe most appropriate combined determination is: C-SSRS Ideation Category $= 3$; Risk $=$ Moderate; Inpatient Observation $=$ checks every $30$ minutes; Post-Discharge Follow-up $=$ contact within $24$–$72$ hours and visit within $1$ week.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Highest C-SSRS ideation severity category = $5$; risk = high; institute $1$:$1$ constant observation; post-discharge follow-up contact within $24$ hours and urgent visit within $24$ hours.**\n- **C-SSRS Category:** Incorrect. The patient does not have a specific plan or intent, which is required for Category $5$.\n- **Risk and Management:** Incorrect. The clinical data do not support a \"high\" risk assessment, and the proposed interventions are too restrictive.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**B. Highest C-SSRS ideation severity category = $3$; risk = moderate; institute observation checks every $30$ minutes; post-discharge follow-up contact within $24$–$72$ hours and outpatient visit within $1$ week.**\n- **C-SSRS Category:** Correct. The patient's thoughts of a method (overdose) without intent align perfectly with Category $3$.\n- **Risk and Management:** Correct. The risk is best classified as \"moderate\" due to the balance of active ideation against strong protective factors. The proposed observation frequency and follow-up plan are the standard of care for a patient with this risk profile.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**C. Highest C-SSRS ideation severity category = $2$; risk = low; institute routine observation checks every $8$ hours; post-discharge follow-up contact within $2$ weeks and outpatient visit within $4$–$6$ weeks.**\n- **C-SSRS Category:** Incorrect. The patient considered a method, which elevates the ideation severity beyond Category $2$ (non-specific thoughts).\n- **Risk and Management:** Incorrect. A \"low\" risk assessment and the corresponding lax management plan fail to adequately address the active nature of the patient's suicidal thoughts.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Highest C-SSRS ideation severity category = $4$; risk = moderate–high; institute observation checks every $15$ minutes; post-discharge follow-up contact within $48$ hours and outpatient visit within $2$ weeks.**\n- **C-SSRS Category:** Incorrect. Category $4$ requires some intent to act, which the patient explicitly denies.\n- **Risk and Management:** Incorrect. The risk is not \"moderate–high,\" and observation checks every $15$ minutes are generally for high-risk patients. The components of this option are internally inconsistent and not aligned with the clinical data.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

            "problem": "In palliative care psychiatry, clinicians often integrate multiple validated patient-reported measures to quantify a single composite severity index, denoted by $S$, for psychological and existential distress. Consider a patient assessed concurrently with the following instruments: the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Demoralization Scale (DS), and the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) psychological distress item. The raw scores are PHQ-9 $=22$ with a scale range $0$ to $27$, GAD-7 $=17$ with a scale range $0$ to $21$, DS $=30$ with a scale range $0$ to $50$, and ESAS psychological distress $=8$ with a scale range $0$ to $10$.\n\nConstruct $S$ from first principles under the following axioms that are standard in classical test theory and multiattribute utility in health measurement:\n- Scale invariance and monotonicity: For each instrument with raw score $x$ on a bounded interval $[x_{\\min}, x_{\\max}]$, the contribution to severity must be an increasing transformation that is invariant under any strictly increasing linear rescaling of the raw interval. Assume the simplest interval-preserving transformation is used.\n- Additivity: The overall severity $S$ is the unique aggregation consistent with independence and continuity of preferences across attributes that preserves linear trade-offs among attributes with fixed weights.\n- Weighting: Use content validity weights consistent with relative harm valuations in advanced palliative care, with PHQ-9 weight $0.30$, GAD-7 weight $0.25$, DS weight $0.30$, and ESAS psychological distress weight $0.15$.\n\nFor interpretation, classify severity categories using anchored cut-points derived from convergence with severe thresholds commonly used across these instruments: mild if $S<0.40$, moderate if $0.40 \\le S < 0.70$, and severe if $S \\ge 0.70$.\n\nCompute $S$ for the patient, and determine the severity category. Express $S$ as a unitless decimal and round your final numeric answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the specified criteria.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Composite severity index: $S$\n- Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9): raw score $x_1 = 22$; scale range $[x_{1,\\min}, x_{1,\\max}] = [0, 27]$; weight $w_1 = 0.30$.\n- Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7): raw score $x_2 = 17$; scale range $[x_{2,\\min}, x_{2,\\max}] = [0, 21]$; weight $w_2 = 0.25$.\n- Demoralization Scale (DS): raw score $x_3 = 30$; scale range $[x_{3,\\min}, x_{3,\\max}] = [0, 50]$; weight $w_3 = 0.30$.\n- Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) psychological distress item: raw score $x_4 = 8$; scale range $[x_{4,\\min}, x_{4,\\max}] = [0, 10]$; weight $w_4 = 0.15$.\n- Axiom 1 (Scale invariance and monotonicity): The contribution of each score is an increasing transformation, invariant under linear rescaling, and is the \"simplest interval-preserving\" form.\n- Axiom 2 (Additivity): $S$ is an aggregation preserving linear trade-offs.\n- Axiom 3 (Weighting): Specific weights are provided for each instrument.\n- Severity Categories: Mild if $S < 0.40$, Moderate if $0.40 \\le S < 0.70$, Severe if $S \\ge 0.70$.\n- Task: Compute $S$ rounded to four significant figures and determine the severity category.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- The problem is scientifically grounded. It utilizes established clinical assessment tools (PHQ-9, GAD-7, etc.) and standard psychometric principles (normalization, weighted averaging) from classical test theory and multi-attribute utility theory. The application in palliative care psychiatry is a valid and recognized context.\n- The problem is well-posed. All necessary data (scores, ranges, weights) and a clear methodology (axioms for normalization and aggregation) are provided to compute a unique solution.\n- The problem is objective. The language is precise and technical, free of subjective claims.\n- The problem is self-contained and consistent. The provided scores are within their respective valid ranges. The sum of the weights is $0.30 + 0.25 + 0.30 + 0.15 = 1.00$, which is internally consistent for a weighted average that maps to a $[0, 1]$ scale. The axioms, while formally stated, directly correspond to standard and well-understood procedures. The \"simplest interval-preserving transformation\" is unambiguously interpreted as linear normalization.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe calculation of the composite severity index $S$ proceeds in two steps as dictated by the axioms: normalization of each raw score, followed by a weighted aggregation of the normalized scores.\n\n**1. Normalization of Individual Scores**\n\nAxiom $1$, \"Scale invariance and monotonicity,\" requires transforming each raw score $x_i$ from its native interval $[x_{i,\\min}, x_{i,\\max}]$ to a common, standardized scale. The \"simplest interval-preserving transformation\" that is also increasing and linear is the standard normalization to the unit interval $[0, 1]$. Let $s_i$ be the normalized score for instrument $i$. The transformation is given by:\n$$s_i = \\frac{x_i - x_{i, \\min}}{x_{i, \\max} - x_{i, \\min}}$$\n\nWe apply this formula to each of the four given scores:\n\n- For PHQ-9 (instrument $1$):\n  $x_1 = 22$, $[x_{1, \\min}, x_{1, \\max}] = [0, 27]$.\n  $$s_1 = \\frac{22 - 0}{27 - 0} = \\frac{22}{27}$$\n\n- For GAD-7 (instrument $2$):\n  $x_2 = 17$, $[x_{2, \\min}, x_{2, \\max}] = [0, 21]$.\n  $$s_2 = \\frac{17 - 0}{21 - 0} = \\frac{17}{21}$$\n\n- For DS (instrument $3$):\n  $x_3 = 30$, $[x_{3, \\min}, x_{3, \\max}] = [0, 50]$.\n  $$s_3 = \\frac{30 - 0}{50 - 0} = \\frac{30}{50} = \\frac{3}{5}$$\n\n- For ESAS (instrument $4$):\n  $x_4 = 8$, $[x_{4, \\min}, x_{4, \\max}] = [0, 10]$.\n  $$s_4 = \\frac{8 - 0}{10 - 0} = \\frac{8}{10} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Composite Severity Index ($S$)**\n\nAxioms $2$ and $3$ (Additivity and Weighting) state that the composite index $S$ is a weighted linear combination of the normalized scores $s_i$. The formula is:\n$$S = w_1 s_1 + w_2 s_2 + w_3 s_3 + w_4 s_4$$\n\nThe provided weights are $w_1 = 0.30$, $w_2 = 0.25$, $w_3 = 0.30$, and $w_4 = 0.15$. Substituting the weights and the calculated normalized scores:\n$$S = (0.30)\\left(\\frac{22}{27}\\right) + (0.25)\\left(\\frac{17}{21}\\right) + (0.30)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + (0.15)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)$$\n\nTo ensure precision, we can perform the calculation using fractions. First, convert the decimal weights to fractions: $0.30 = \\frac{3}{10}$, $0.25 = \\frac{1}{4}$, and $0.15 = \\frac{15}{100} = \\frac{3}{20}$.\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{22}{27}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{17}{21}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{20}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)$$\n$$S = \\frac{66}{270} + \\frac{17}{84} + \\frac{9}{50} + \\frac{12}{100}$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$S = \\frac{11}{45} + \\frac{17}{84} + \\frac{9}{50} + \\frac{3}{25}$$\nThe last two terms can also be calculated from the problem directly:\n$(0.30)(0.6) = 0.18$ and $(0.15)(0.8) = 0.12$.\nSo, $S = \\frac{11}{45} + \\frac{17}{84} + 0.18 + 0.12 = \\frac{11}{45} + \\frac{17}{84} + 0.30$.\nTo sum the fractions, we find a common denominator for $45 = 3^2 \\times 5$ and $84 = 2^2 \\times 3 \\times 7$. The least common denominator is $2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 1260$.\n$$S = \\frac{11 \\times 28}{45 \\times 28} + \\frac{17 \\times 15}{84 \\times 15} + \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{308}{1260} + \\frac{255}{1260} + \\frac{378}{1260}$$\n$$S = \\frac{308 + 255 + 378}{1260} = \\frac{941}{1260}$$\n\nNow, we compute the decimal value for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{941}{1260} \\approx 0.7468253968\\ldots$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $7$, $4$, $6$, and $8$. The following digit is $2$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$S \\approx 0.7468$$\n\n**3. Determination of Severity Category**\n\nThe final step is to classify this value of $S$ using the given categories:\n- Mild if $S < 0.40$\n- Moderate if $0.40 \\le S < 0.70$\n- Severe if $S \\ge 0.70$\n\nSince our calculated value is $S \\approx 0.7468$, and $0.7468 \\ge 0.70$, the patient's composite psychological and existential distress is classified as **Severe**.",

The decision must be framed as an expected-value calculation grounded in evidence-based medicine and patient-centered utilities, using the following well-tested definitions and assumptions.\n\nCore definitions:\n- Number Needed to Treat ($NNT$) is defined as $NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$, where $ARR$ is the absolute risk reduction in the beneficial outcome under treatment versus no treatment.\n- Number Needed to Harm ($NNH$) is defined as $NNH = \\frac{1}{ARI}$, where $ARI$ is the absolute risk increase in the harmful outcome under treatment versus no treatment.\n\nLiterature-based values for antipsychotics in dementia over a $12$-week horizon:\n- Clinically significant agitation reduction: $NNT = 10$.\n- Clinically significant sedation with functional decline: $NNH = 7$.\n\nPatient-centered utility model over the same $12$-week horizon:\n- If the beneficial response occurs, the patient experiences on average a reduction of $3$ severe distress-days per week attributable to agitation relief, maintained across the horizon.\n- If the harmful sedation outcome occurs, the patient experiences on average an increase of $2$ distress-days per week attributable to sedation-related discomfort or immobility, maintained across the horizon.\n\nAssumptions for modeling:\n- The incremental probability of benefit due to treatment relative to no treatment equals $ARR$ and the incremental probability of harm due to treatment relative to no treatment equals $ARI$.\n- Expected net benefit is computed by linearity of expectation under an additive utility model over the horizon, treating the benefit and harm contributions as separable expected values.\n\nUsing only the core definitions and the linearity of expectation, derive an expression for the expected net number of distress-days avoided per treated patient over $12$ weeks, relative to no treatment, and compute its numerical value using the given inputs. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express the result in days. The final answer must be a single number.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously reviewed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of evidence-based medicine and decision analysis, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of definitions and data, and objectively formulated. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the expected net number of distress-days avoided per treated patient over a $12$-week horizon, relative to no treatment. Let this quantity be denoted by $E_{net}$. The problem specifies using an additive model with linearity of expectation, where the contributions from benefit and harm are separable. This allows us to write the net expectation as the sum of the individual expectations.\n\nLet $E_{benefit}$ represent the expected number of distress-days avoided due to the beneficial outcome (agitation reduction).\nLet $E_{harm}$ represent the expected number of distress-days incurred due to the harmful outcome (sedation).\nThe net expected number of distress-days avoided is then given by:\n$$E_{net} = E_{benefit} - E_{harm}$$\nThe subtraction is necessary because $E_{harm}$ represents an increase in distress, which corresponds to a negative number of avoided distress-days.\n\nFirst, we formulate the expression for $E_{benefit}$. The expected value is the product of the probability of an outcome and the value of that outcome.\nThe incremental probability of the beneficial outcome occurring due to the treatment is given as the Absolute Risk Reduction, $ARR$.\nThe problem states the definition $NNT = \\frac{1}{ARR}$, where $NNT$ is the Number Needed to Treat. Therefore, the probability of benefit is:\n$$P_{benefit} = ARR = \\frac{1}{NNT}$$\nThe value (or utility) of the beneficial outcome is a reduction of $3$ distress-days per week, maintained over the time horizon of $T = 12$ weeks. Let the utility of benefit be $U_B = 3 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}}$. The total number of distress-days avoided if the benefit occurs is:\n$$D_{benefit} = U_B \\times T = 3 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 36 \\text{ days}$$\nThe expected number of distress-days avoided due to the benefit is:\n$$E_{benefit} = P_{benefit} \\times D_{benefit} = ARR \\times (U_B \\times T) = \\frac{U_B \\times T}{NNT}$$\n\nNext, we formulate the expression for $E_{harm}$. The incremental probability of the harmful outcome is the Absolute Risk Increase, $ARI$.\nThe problem states the definition $NNH = \\frac{1}{ARI}$, where $NNH$ is the Number Needed to Harm. Therefore, the probability of harm is:\n$$P_{harm} = ARI = \\frac{1}{NNH}$$\nThe value of the harmful outcome is an increase of $2$ distress-days per week, over the same $12$-week horizon. Let the disutility of harm be $U_H = 2 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}}$. The total number of distress-days incurred if the harm occurs is:\n$$D_{harm} = U_H \\times T = 2 \\frac{\\text{days}}{\\text{week}} \\times 12 \\text{ weeks} = 24 \\text{ days}$$\nThe expected number of distress-days incurred due to the harm is:\n$$E_{harm} = P_{harm} \\times D_{harm} = ARI \\times (U_H \\times T) = \\frac{U_H \\times T}{NNH}$$\n\nWe can now construct the expression for the expected net number of distress-days avoided, $E_{net}$:\n$$E_{net} = E_{benefit} - E_{harm} = \\frac{U_B \\times T}{NNT} - \\frac{U_H \\times T}{NNH}$$\nThis is the general expression derived from the given principles.\n\nWe are provided with the following numerical values:\n- Time horizon, $T = 12$ weeks.\n- Utility of benefit, $U_B = 3$ days/week.\n- Disutility of harm, $U_H = 2$ days/week.\n- Number Needed to Treat, $NNT = 10$.\n- Number Needed to Harm, $NNH = 7$.\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$E_{net} = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{10} - \\frac{2 \\times 12}{7}$$\n$$E_{net} = \\frac{36}{10} - \\frac{24}{7}$$\n$$E_{net} = 3.6 - \\frac{24}{7}$$\nTo perform the subtraction, we can express the second term as a decimal:\n$$\\frac{24}{7} \\approx 3.4285714...$$\n$$E_{net} \\approx 3.6 - 3.4285714...$$\n$$E_{net} \\approx 0.17142857...$$\nThe problem requires the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$E_{net} \\approx 0.1714$$\nThe expected net number of distress-days avoided per treated patient over the $12$-week period is approximately $0.1714$ days. The positive value indicates a net expected benefit, however small.",
