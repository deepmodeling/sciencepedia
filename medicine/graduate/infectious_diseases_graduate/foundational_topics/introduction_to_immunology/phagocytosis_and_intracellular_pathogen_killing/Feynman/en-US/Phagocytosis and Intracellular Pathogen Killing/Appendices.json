This corresponds to the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics. The rate of reaction, $v$, is given by:\n$$v = \\frac{V_{\\max} [S]}{K_{m} + [S]}$$\nIn this context, the rate $v$ is the nitric oxide production rate $r_{\\mathrm{NO}}$, and the substrate $S$ is L-arginine, [Arg].

Using the base ligand concentrations $L_{0,\\mathrm{IgG}} = 100$ nM and $L_{0,\\mathrm{C3b}} = 100$ nM:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{IgG}} \\cdot L_{0,\\mathrm{IgG}} = 100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{IgG}}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{C3b}} \\cdot L_{0,\\mathrm{C3b}} = 100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{C3b}}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Fractional Receptor Occupancy**\nThe fractional occupancy of each receptor type is modeled by the Langmuir isotherm, which describes equilibrium binding. Using the dissociation constants $K_{D,\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = 10$ nM and $K_{D,\\mathrm{CR3}} = 50$ nM:\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = \\dfrac{L_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}}{L_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} + K_{D,\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}} = \\dfrac{100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{IgG}}}{100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{IgG}} + 10}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = \\dfrac{L_{\\mathrm{CR3}}}{L_{\\mathrm{CR3}} + K_{D,\\mathrm{CR3}}} = \\dfrac{100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{C3b}}}{100 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{C3b}} + 50}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Number of Occupied Receptors**\nThe total number of engaged receptors within the contact area $A = 1.0 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$ is calculated from the receptor surface densities ($R_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}$, $R_{\\mathrm{CR3}}$) and their fractional occupancies:\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = R_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} \\cdot A \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = R_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}\n$$\n$$\nn_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{CR3}} = R_{\\mathrm{CR3}} \\cdot A \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = R_{\\mathrm{CR3}} \\cdot \\theta_{\\mathrm{CR3}}\n$$\n\n**Step 5: Total Signaling Strength**\nThe downstream signal from each receptor type is a switch-like, saturating function of the number of occupied receptors, modeled by a Hill function. The signal strength for receptor type $r$ is:\n$$\nS_r = \\dfrac{n_{\\mathrm{occ},r}^{h_r}}{n_{1/2,r}^{h_r} + n_{\\mathrm{occ},r}^{h_r}}\n$$\nUsing the given parameters ($h_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = 2, n_{1/2,\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = 50$; $h_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = 2, n_{1/2,\\mathrm{CR3}} = 30$):\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = \\dfrac{n_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}^{2}}{50^2 + n_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = \\dfrac{n_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{CR3}}^{2}}{30^2 + n_{\\mathrm{occ},\\mathrm{CR3}}^{2}}\n$$\nThe total signal, $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the weighted sum of signals from Fc$\\gamma$ receptors, CR3 receptors, and a baseline Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) signal, $S_{\\mathrm{PRR}}$. With weights $w_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} = 1.0$, $w_{\\mathrm{CR3}} = 0.8$, and $w_{\\mathrm{PRR}} = 0.5$:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{tot}} = w_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{Fc\\gamma}} + w_{\\mathrm{CR3}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{CR3}} + w_{\\mathrm{PRR}} \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{PRR}}\n$$\n\n**Step 6: Likelihood Ratio**\nThe likelihood ratio $\\Lambda(X)$ integrates the evidence from the total signal $S_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and the average opsonin coverage $\\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{IgG}} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{C3b}}}{2}$. A log-linear model is specified:\n$$\n\\log(\\Lambda(X)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_S S_{\\mathrm{tot}} + \\beta_\\rho \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}} + \\beta_{\\mathrm{int}} S_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nUsing the supplied coefficients ($\\beta_0 = 0.0$, $\\beta_S = 2.0$, $\\beta_\\rho = 1.0$, $\\beta_{\\mathrm{int}} = 0.5$):\n$$\n\\log(\\Lambda(X)) = 2.0 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{tot}} + 1.0 \\cdot \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}} + 0.5 \\cdot S_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}}\n$$\nExponentiating both sides gives the likelihood ratio:\n$$\n\\Lambda(X) = \\exp(2.0 S_{\\mathrm{tot}} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}} + 0.5 S_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\rho_{\\mathrm{tot}})\n$$\n\n**Step 7: Posterior Probability**\nFinally, the posterior odds are calculated by multiplying the prior odds by the likelihood ratio:\n$$\nO(E\\mid X) = O(E) \\cdot \\Lambda(X) = \\dfrac{1}{9} \\Lambda(X)\n$$\nThe posterior probability of engulfment is then recovered from the posterior odds:\n$$\nP(E\\mid X) = \\dfrac{O(E\\mid X)}{1 + O(E\\mid X)}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.
