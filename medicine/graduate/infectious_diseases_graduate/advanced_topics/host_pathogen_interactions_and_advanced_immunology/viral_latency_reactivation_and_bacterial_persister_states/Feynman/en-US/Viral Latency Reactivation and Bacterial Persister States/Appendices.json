The processes (mass-action kinetics, first-order decay, constant source) are well-established for modeling such systems. The problem is well-posed; it asks for a specific quantity, $\\epsilon_c$, derived from a stability analysis of a well-defined system of ODEs. The language is objective and precise. The provided information is self-contained and sufficient to construct the model and perform the required analysis. The constraint $a + d_L > \\rho$ is crucial for ensuring the latent cell population does not grow exponentially on its own, which is a biologically reasonable assumption for a stable latent reservoir that requires replenishment from active infection. All parameters are stated to be nonnegative, which is physically consistent. The problem is neither trivial nor tautological and requires a standard but non-obvious application of stability theory for dynamical systems.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nBased on the processes described, we construct the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the populations $T(t)$, $I(t)$, and $L(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = s - d_T T - (1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dI}{dt} = (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I + aL - \\delta I\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dL}{dt} = f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I + \\rho L - a L - d_L L = f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I - (a+d_L-\\rho)L\n$$\n\nThe disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is the steady state where there is no infection, i.e., $I=0$ and $L=0$. At this equilibrium, the equation for $T$ becomes $\\frac{dT}{dt} = s - d_T T = 0$, which yields the equilibrium target cell count $T_0 = \\frac{s}{d_T}$. Thus, the DFE is $(T_0, I_0, L_0) = (\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)$.\n\nTo determine the condition under which the infection cannot persist, we analyze the local stability of the DFE. The infection will be cleared if small perturbations in the infected populations, $I$ and $L$, decay over time. This is equivalent to requiring that the basic reproduction number under therapy, $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$, is less than $1$. We use the next-generation matrix method to calculate $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$.\n\nThe infected subsystem is described by the equations for $\\frac{dI}{dt}$ and $\\frac{dL}{dt}$. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be the vector of rates of new infections and $\\mathcal{V}$ be the vector of rates of transfer between infected compartments.\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta T I \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{V} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta I - aL \\\\ (a+d_L-\\rho)L \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe linearize these systems by taking the Jacobian matrices with respect to $(I, L)$ and evaluating them at the DFE $(T_0, 0, 0)$.\nLet $F$ and $V$ be the Jacobians of $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{V}$ respectively, evaluated at the DFE:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{F}}{\\partial(I, L)}\\bigg|_{(\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nV = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{V}}{\\partial(I, L)}\\bigg|_{(\\frac{s}{d_T}, 0, 0)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\delta & -a \\\\ 0 & a+d_L-\\rho \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe next-generation matrix is given by $K = F V^{-1}$. First, we compute the inverse of $V$:\n$$\nV^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(V)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem statement gives the condition $a+d_L-\\rho > 0$, so $V$ is invertible.\nNow, we compute the next-generation matrix $K$:\n$$\nK = F V^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\\\ f(1-\\epsilon)\\beta \\frac{s}{d_T} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f) & 0 \\\\ f & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} a+d_L-\\rho & a \\\\ 0 & \\delta \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nK = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\begin{pmatrix} (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) & a(1-f) \\\\ f(a+d_L-\\rho) & af \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$, is the spectral radius (dominant eigenvalue) of $K$. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ satisfy $\\lambda^2 - \\text{tr}(K)\\lambda + \\det(K) = 0$.\nThe determinant of $K$ is:\n$$\n\\det(K) = \\left(\\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)}\\right)^2 \\left( (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho)(af) - a(1-f)f(a+d_L-\\rho) \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\det(K)=0$, one eigenvalue is $0$. The other eigenvalue is equal to the trace of $K$.\n$$\nR_{0, \\text{ART}} = \\rho(K) = \\text{tr}(K) = \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\beta s}{d_T \\delta(a+d_L-\\rho)} \\left( (1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) + af \\right)\n$$\nWe can simplify the expression in the parenthesis:\n$$\n(1-f)(a+d_L-\\rho) + af = a+d_L-\\rho - f(a+d_L-\\rho) + af = a+d_L-\\rho - fa-fd_L+f\\rho+af = a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $R_{0, \\text{ART}}$ gives:\n$$\nR_{0, \\text{ART}} = (1-\\epsilon) \\frac{\\beta s}{d_T \\delta} \\frac{a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho)}{a+d_L-\\rho}\n$$\nThe infection-replenished cycle is not self-sustaining when the DFE is locally stable, which occurs when $R_{0, \\text{ART}} < 1$. The minimal ART efficacy, $\\epsilon_c$, is the value of $\\epsilon$ at the threshold of stability, i.e., where $R_{0, \\text{ART}} = 1$.\n$$\n1 = (1-\\epsilon_c) \\frac{\\beta s}{d_T \\delta} \\left( \\frac{a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho)}{a+d_L-\\rho} \\right)\n$$\nSolving for $\\epsilon_c$:\n$$\n1 - \\epsilon_c = \\frac{d_T \\delta (a+d_L-\\rho)}{\\beta s (a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho))}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_c = 1 - \\frac{d_T \\delta (a+d_L-\\rho)}{\\beta s (a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho))}\n$$\nThis expression represents the critical efficacy required to drive the basic reproduction number below unity and thus ensure that the infected subsystem, including the latent reservoir replenished by new infections, cannot sustain itself. This is the closed-form analytic expression for $\\epsilon_c$.\nThe baseline reproduction number in the absence of therapy ($\\epsilon=0$) is\n$$R_0 = \\frac{\\beta s (a+(1-f)(d_L-\\rho))}{d_T \\delta (a+d_L-\\rho)}$$\nThe critical efficacy can be written as $\\epsilon_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$. If $R_0 \\le 1$, the infection is not self-sustaining even without therapy, so the required efficacy is $\\epsilon_c=0$. If $R_0 > 1$, a positive efficacy $0 < \\epsilon_c < 1$ is required.",

I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\nLet $E$ be the event that at least one reactivation occurs by time $T$. It is more direct to calculate the complementary probability, $P(E^c)$, which is the probability that no reactivation events occur by time $T$. The desired probability is then $P(E) = 1 - P(E^c)$.\n\nThe occurrence of events is gated by the random persister exit time $T_p$. We can find $P(E^c)$ by conditioning on $T_p$ and using the law of total probability. The probability density function of $T_p$ is $f_{T_p}(t_p) = \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_p)$ for $t_p \\ge 0$.\n$$P(E^c) = \\int_0^\\infty P(E^c | T_p=t_p) f_{T_p}(t_p) dt_p$$\nWe must consider two cases for the value of $t_p$:\n1.  If $t_p \\ge T$, the gate opens at or after the observation horizon $T$. Thus, no event can be observed by time $T$. The probability of no events is $1$.\n2.  If $0 \\le t_p < T$, the gate opens at time $t_p$. For no events to occur by time $T$, the NHPP must have zero events in the interval $[t_p, T]$. The probability for this is $\\exp\\left(-\\int_{t_p}^T \\lambda(u) du\\right)$.\n\nWe can now split the integral for $P(E^c)$:\n$$P(E^c) = \\int_0^T \\exp\\left(-\\int_{t_p}^T \\lambda(u) du\\right) \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_p) dt_p + \\int_T^\\infty 1 \\cdot \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_p) dt_p$$\nThe second integral represents the case where the persister state has not exited by time $T$, i.e., $P(T_p > T)$:\n$$\\int_T^\\infty \\mu \\exp(-\\mu t_p) dt_p = [-\\exp(-\\mu t_p)]_T^\\infty = \\exp(-\\mu T)$$\nSo, the probability of no events is:\n$$P(E^c) = \\exp(-\\mu T) + \\mu \\int_0^T \\exp(-\\mu t_p) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{t_p}^T \\lambda(u) du\\right) dt_p$$\nLet's define the cumulative intensity function $M(t) = \\int_0^t \\lambda(u) du$.

Our models of viral latency rely on accurately measuring the size of the latent reservoir, a notoriously difficult task . This practice puts you in the role of a critical scientist, analyzing how various sources of measurement error in common PCR-based assays—from primer mismatches to contamination—can systematically bias estimates of the reservoir size and, consequently, distort predictions about the efficacy of cure strategies.",

            "problem": "A clinical trial of a latency-reversing agent in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seeks to estimate the reduction in the intact latent reservoir to predict the time to viral rebound after stopping antiretroviral therapy. Investigators use two Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based assays on peripheral blood mononuclear cells: quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) for total HIV DNA and the digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA). Consider the following mechanistic starting points and definitions.\n\n- By definition, the clinically relevant reservoir is the number of cells harboring genetically intact, replication-competent provirus, denoted by $R^{\\ast}$. The total number of proviruses (intact plus defective) is denoted by $R_{\\text{tot}}$, with defective fraction $f_{d}$ so that $R^{\\ast} = \\left(1 - f_{d}\\right) R_{\\text{tot}}$.\n- For time-to-rebound predictions, assume the following fundamental model: each intact latent cell reactivates independently as a Poisson process with per-cell rate $h$, and virologic rebound occurs at the first reactivation that successfully seeds systemic infection. Under this model, the time to rebound $T$ is the minimum of $R^{\\ast}$ independent exponential waiting times with rate $h$.\n- Let $p_{\\text{tot}}$ and $p_{\\text{int}}$ denote the probability that a proviral template present in the input is detected by the total HIV DNA qPCR and by IPDA, respectively. These probabilities summarize primer–template match, amplicon integrity, and any other per-template detection effects. Let $c$ denote an additive background contamination level that contributes apparent positive copies independent of true input (e.g., low-level carryover).\n- Sampling a finite number of cells induces stochasticity that is well-modeled by Poisson or binomial sampling under limiting-input conditions when detection is perfect. In the absence of detection failure, such sampling is unbiased in expectation but increases variance.\n- Assume that qPCR readouts are susceptible to suboptimal amplification efficiency if uncalibrated, whereas digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) readouts are less sensitive to amplification efficiency but remain sensitive to primer–template mismatches and amplicon dropout.\n\nUsing only the principles above, evaluate the following statements about sources of measurement error when estimating $R^{\\ast}$ with PCR-based assays and how these errors bias inference about cure strategies, including predicted time to rebound and perceived efficacy. Select all statements that are correct.\n\nA. Primer–template mismatches in IPDA that reduce $p_{\\text{int}}$ below $1$ cause underestimation of $R^{\\ast}$. When this underestimated $R^{\\ast}$ is used in the Poisson reactivation model, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased upward, overstating cure efficacy.\n\nB. Using total HIV DNA qPCR as a proxy for $R^{\\ast}$ tends to overestimate the clinically relevant reservoir because $f_{d}$ is typically large. When total HIV DNA is plugged into the Poisson reactivation model as if it were $R^{\\ast}$, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased downward, making interventions appear less effective than they truly are.\n\nC. Because finite-input sampling noise is well-described by Poisson statistics, it systematically biases low the measured IPDA count at small input volumes, thereby making cure strategies look falsely more effective on average.\n\nD. Low-level cross-contamination that contributes an additive background $c > 0$ to measured copy numbers causes a nonzero floor even when the true post-intervention reservoir is very small, biasing measured fold-reductions downward and leading to pessimistic assessments of cure efficacy, especially at low $R^{\\ast}$.\n\nE. When sequence data are available, deduplicating expanded intact proviral clones to count only unique integration sites yields an unbiased estimate for rebound risk, because the time to first reactivation depends only on the number of unique clones, not on their cellular abundance.\n\nF. Digital droplet partitioning in IPDA eliminates the impact of primer mismatches and amplicon dropout across HIV subtypes, ensuring that IPDA-based predictions of rebound are unbiased regardless of viral diversity.\n\nG. In qPCR, unrecognized PCR inhibition that reduces amplification efficiency below $100\\%$ causes undercounting of templates relative to a properly calibrated standard curve, which biases predicted time to rebound upward and overstates cure effect if not corrected.",
            "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate several statements about measurement error in quantifying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) latent reservoir and the resulting impact on predicting treatment outcomes. The validation of the problem statement finds it to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, based on established principles in virology and molecular diagnostics. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the relationship between the size of the intact, replication-competent reservoir, $R^{\\ast}$, and the predicted mean time to viral rebound, $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. According to the provided model, the time to rebound $T$ is the minimum of $R^{\\ast}$ independent exponential waiting times, each with a per-cell reactivation rate of $h$. This implies that the overall reactivation process is a Poisson process with a total rate of $R^{\\ast}h$. The time to the first event in such a process follows an exponential distribution with this rate.\n\nTherefore, $T \\sim \\text{Exponential}(R^{\\ast}h)$. The mean of this distribution is the expected time to rebound:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h} $$\nThis fundamental equation shows that the mean time to rebound is inversely proportional to the size of the intact reservoir $R^{\\ast}$. Any error in the measurement of $R^{\\ast}$ will propagate into a biased prediction of $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. Let $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}$ be the estimated reservoir size. The predicted mean time to rebound will be $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each statement based on this principle.\n\n**A. Primer–template mismatches in IPDA that reduce $p_{\\text{int}}$ below $1$ cause underestimation of $R^{\\ast}$. When this underestimated $R^{\\ast}$ is used in the Poisson reactivation model, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased upward, overstating cure efficacy.**\n\nThe Intact Proviral DNA Assay (IPDA) aims to measure $R^{\\ast}$. The problem states that $p_{\\text{int}}$ is the probability of detecting a proviral template. If primer–template mismatches occur, some intact proviruses will not be detected, causing $p_{\\text{int}} < 1$. The expected measured count will be an estimate $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}$ that is systematically lower than the true count $R^{\\ast}$ (i.e., $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} \\approx p_{\\text{int}} R^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$). This is an **underestimation** of the reservoir.\nUsing this underestimated value in the rebound model gives a predicted mean time $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$. Since $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} > \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$, which means $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] > \\mathbb{E}[T]$. The predicted time to rebound is biased **upward** (predicted to be longer than the true mean). A longer time to rebound is interpreted as a more successful therapeutic outcome, thus **overstating cure efficacy**. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Using total HIV DNA qPCR as a proxy for $R^{\\ast}$ tends to overestimate the clinically relevant reservoir because $f_{d}$ is typically large. When total HIV DNA is plugged into the Poisson reactivation model as if it were $R^{\\ast}$, the predicted mean time to rebound is biased downward, making interventions appear less effective than they truly are.**\n\nThe problem defines the true intact reservoir as $R^{\\ast} = (1 - f_{d}) R_{\\text{tot}}$, where $R_{\\text{tot}}$ is the total HIV DNA and $f_{d}$ is the large fraction of defective proviruses. Using total HIV DNA as a proxy means we set our estimate $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} = R_{\\text{tot}}$. Since $f_{d}$ is large (e.g., studies show it can be $> 0.95$), $1 - f_{d}$ is small, and thus $R_{\\text{tot}} \\gg R^{\\ast}$. This is a significant **overestimation** of the clinically relevant reservoir.\nThe predicted mean time to rebound is $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{tot}}h}$. Since $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} > R^{\\ast}$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h} < \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$, meaning $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] < \\mathbb{E}[T]$. The predicted time to rebound is biased **downward** (predicted to be shorter than the true mean). A shorter rebound time implies the intervention was less effective at controlling the virus, leading to an unduly pessimistic assessment of its efficacy. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because finite-input sampling noise is well-described by Poisson statistics, it systematically biases low the measured IPDA count at small input volumes, thereby making cure strategies look falsely more effective on average.**\n\nThe problem statement explicitly mentions that finite-input sampling \"is unbiased in expectation but increases variance.\" This is a core property of Poisson and binomial sampling. If the true average number of targets in a given sample volume is $\\lambda$, the expected value of a measurement drawn from a Poisson($\\lambda$) distribution is precisely $\\lambda$. While any single measurement may be higher or lower than $\\lambda$, there is no systematic bias in the average measurement over many trials. The statement's claim of a systematic low bias is a direct contradiction of the provided premises and the properties of Poisson sampling. Increased variance can complicate statistical inference, but it does not cause a systematic bias in the mean estimate.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Low-level cross-contamination that contributes an additive background $c > 0$ to measured copy numbers causes a nonzero floor even when the true post-intervention reservoir is very small, biasing measured fold-reductions downward and leading to pessimistic assessments of cure efficacy, especially at low $R^{\\ast}$.**\n\nContamination introduces an additive error, so the measured value is $\\hat{R}^{\\ast} \\approx R^{\\ast}_{\\text{true}} + c$, where $c > 0$. Consider a pre-intervention measurement $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} + c$ and a post-intervention measurement $\\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c$. The true fold-reduction is $F_{\\text{true}} = R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} / R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}}$. The measured fold-reduction is $\\hat{F} = \\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} / \\hat{R}^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} = (R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} + c) / (R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c)$.\nAssuming an effective intervention, $R^{\\ast}_{\\text{pre}} > R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} > 0$. For any $c > 0$, it is a mathematical property that $\\frac{A+c}{B+c} < \\frac{A}{B}$ when $A > B > 0$. Thus, $\\hat{F} < F_{\\text{true}}$. The measured fold-reduction is biased **downward**. A smaller apparent reduction in the reservoir suggests the cure strategy is less effective than it truly is, leading to a **pessimistic assessment**. This effect is most pronounced when $R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}}$ is small, as the denominator $(R^{\\ast}_{\\text{post}} + c)$ is then dominated by the constant $c$, limiting the maximum achievable fold-reduction measurement. The logic is sound.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. When sequence data are available, deduplicating expanded intact proviral clones to count only unique integration sites yields an unbiased estimate for rebound risk, because the time to first reactivation depends only on the number of unique clones, not on their cellular abundance.**\n\nThe model premise is that \"each intact latent cell reactivates independently as a Poisson process with per-cell rate $h$.\" This means that if a single clone has expanded into $N$ cells, there are $N$ independent sources of reactivation, each contributing a rate $h$ to the total reactivation rate. The total rate is therefore proportional to the total number of cells, $R^{\\ast}$, not the number of unique integration sites. The statement claims rebound risk depends only on the number of unique clones, which directly contradicts the model. Counting only unique clones would lead to an underestimation of the total reactivation rate $R^{\\ast}h$, and thus an overestimation of the time to rebound $\\mathbb{E}[T]$, creating a biased (overly optimistic) prediction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**F. Digital droplet partitioning in IPDA eliminates the impact of primer mismatches and amplicon dropout across HIV subtypes, ensuring that IPDA-based predictions of rebound are unbiased regardless of viral diversity.**\n\nThe problem statement specifies that \"digital droplet Polymerase Chain Reaction (ddPCR) readouts ... remain sensitive to primer–template mismatches and amplicon dropout.\" Digital partitioning allows for absolute quantification without reliance on amplification efficiency by counting positive versus negative droplets. However, it cannot make a reaction occur if the primers do not bind to the template in the first place. Primer mismatches, which are more likely with higher viral diversity (i.e., across different subtypes), prevent amplification and lead to false-negative droplets. Therefore, ddPCR does not eliminate this problem; it remains a source of underestimation bias. The statement is factually incorrect based on the provided premises.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**G. In qPCR, unrecognized PCR inhibition that reduces amplification efficiency below $100\\%$ causes undercounting of templates relative to a properly calibrated standard curve, which biases predicted time to rebound upward and overstates cure effect if not corrected.**\n\nIn quantitative PCR (qPCR), the amount of template is inferred from the cycle number at which fluorescence crosses a threshold (Cq). This inference relies on a standard curve generated under ideal conditions (near $100\\%$ efficiency). If an unknown inhibitor in the sample reduces amplification efficiency, it will take more cycles to reach the threshold, resulting in a higher Cq value. When this higher Cq is mapped onto the standard curve, it is interpreted as a lower initial quantity of template. This is **undercounting**.\nIf this undercounted value is used as an estimate for the reservoir size ($\\hat{R}^{\\ast} < R^{\\ast}$), the predicted mean time to rebound $\\hat{\\mathbb{E}}[T] = \\frac{1}{\\hat{R}^{\\ast}h}$ will be greater than the true mean $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\frac{1}{R^{\\ast}h}$. This is an **upward bias** in the predicted time to rebound, which **overstates the efficacy** of the cure strategy. The entire causal chain is correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, D, and G are correct descriptions of how measurement errors propagate to biased conclusions about HIV cure strategies.",
