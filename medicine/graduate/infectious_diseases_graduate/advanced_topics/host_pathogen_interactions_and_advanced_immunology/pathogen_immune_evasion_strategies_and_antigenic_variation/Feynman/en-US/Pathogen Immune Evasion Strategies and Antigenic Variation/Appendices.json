This practice explores this strategy by modeling how a bacterium can recruit Factor H to its surface to inhibit complement deposition. By applying the fundamental principles of mass-action equilibrium, you will quantify how enhancing the affinity for Factor H directly translates into increased pathogen survival, providing a clear link between molecular binding events and immune evasion efficacy .",

            "problem": "A Gram-negative bacterial pathogen increases lipooligosaccharide (LOS) sialylation to recruit human complement Factor H (FH), thereby suppressing Complement component 3b (C3b) deposition on its surface. Consider a simple kinetic scheme in which FH binds to a single class of independent LOS sites, denoted by $\\mathrm{S}$, with $1{:}1$ stoichiometry (one FH per site). Use mass-action equilibrium as the fundamental base. The association constant is defined by $K_{a} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]}{[\\mathrm{FH}][\\mathrm{S}]}$. Let $[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ be the total concentration of LOS sites, $[\\mathrm{FH}]$ the free FH concentration in the surrounding fluid, and $\\theta$ the fraction of LOS sites occupied by FH at equilibrium. Assume $[\\mathrm{FH}]$ is held effectively constant by a large reservoir so that binding does not deplete it.\n\nComplement deposition onto an individual LOS site proceeds with a baseline first-order rate constant $k_{0}$ when the site is unoccupied. When FH is bound, the deposition rate at that site is attenuated to $\\alpha k_{0}$ with a constant attenuation factor $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ that is independent of $K_{a}$ and $[\\mathrm{FH}]$. The effective deposition rate constant across the surface, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the occupancy-weighted average over bound and unbound sites.\n\nBefore sialylation, the FH-LOS association constant is $K_{a,0} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$. After sialylation, the affinity increases ten-fold to $K_{a,1} = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}$. The FH concentration bathing the surface is $[\\mathrm{FH}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The attenuation factor is $\\alpha = 0.05$. Treat $k_{0}$, $K_{a}$, $\\alpha$, and $[\\mathrm{FH}]$ as time-independent constants.\n\nUsing only mass-action equilibrium and the definitions given, derive the closed-form expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta$ in terms of $K_{a}$ and $[\\mathrm{FH}]$, then express $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ in terms of $\\theta$, $k_{0}$, and $\\alpha$.

The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data and definitions provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic.\n\nThe first task is to derive the closed-form expression for the fractional occupancy of LOS sites, $\\theta$. By definition, $\\theta$ is the ratio of the concentration of occupied sites, $[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]$, to the total concentration of sites, $[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]}{[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nThe total concentration of sites is the sum of free (unoccupied) sites, $[\\mathrm{S}]$, and occupied sites, $[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]$.\n$$\n[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{S}] + [\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]\n$$\nThe binding is governed by mass-action equilibrium, defined by the association constant $K_{a}$:\n$$\nK_{a} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]}{[\\mathrm{FH}][\\mathrm{S}]}\n$$\nFrom this equilibrium expression, we can write the concentration of occupied sites as $[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}] = K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}][\\mathrm{S}]$. Substituting this into the equation for the total site concentration gives:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [\\mathrm{S}] + K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}][\\mathrm{S}] = [\\mathrm{S}](1 + K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}])\n$$\nWe can now express the concentration of free sites, $[\\mathrm{S}]$, in terms of $[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{S}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}]}\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $[\\mathrm{S}]$ back into the equation for $[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]$:\n$$\n[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}] = K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}] \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}]} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this into the definition of $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[\\mathrm{FH}:\\mathrm{S}]}{[\\mathrm{S}]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} = \\frac{K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}]}{1 + K_{a}[\\mathrm{FH}]}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\theta$.

The problem states that $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the occupancy-weighted average of the rate constants for unbound and bound sites. The fraction of unbound sites is $(1 - \\theta)$ with rate constant $k_{0}$, and the fraction of bound sites is $\\theta$ with rate constant $\\alpha k_{0}$.\nThe weighted average is therefore:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{0}(1 - \\theta) + (\\alpha k_{0})\\theta\n$$\nFactoring out $k_{0}$ gives:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{0}(1 - \\theta + \\alpha \\theta)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{0}(1 - (1 - \\alpha)\\theta)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\n\nThe final task is to compute the fold-change $F$ in the effective complement deposition rate constant due to sialylation.

Assume host immunoglobulin G (IgG) binds the virus with an equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{N}$, and that bound virions are neutralized such that only unbound virions can use the canonical receptor.

The model uses standard principles:\n1.  **Law of Mass Action:** The fraction of unbound virus is derived from the definition of the dissociation constant $K_N$.

Cross-multiplication gives:\n$$V_0 (K + C) = \\alpha (K_N + C)$$\n$$V_0 K + V_0 C = \\alpha K_N + \\alpha C$$\nGroup all terms containing $C$ on one side and constant terms on the other:\n$$V_0 C - \\alpha C = \\alpha K_N - V_0 K$$\nFactor out $C$:\n$$C (V_0 - \\alpha) = \\alpha K_N - V_0 K$$\nFinally, isolate $C$ to find the expression for $C^*$:\n$$C^* = \\frac{\\alpha K_N - V_0 K}{V_0 - \\alpha}$$\nThis is the unique non-zero concentration at which the total entry rate returns to the baseline level. For $C^*$ to be positive and physically meaningful in the context of ADE, the conditions $\\alpha K_N > V_0 K$ (numerator positive) and $V_0 > \\alpha$ (denominator positive) must hold.
