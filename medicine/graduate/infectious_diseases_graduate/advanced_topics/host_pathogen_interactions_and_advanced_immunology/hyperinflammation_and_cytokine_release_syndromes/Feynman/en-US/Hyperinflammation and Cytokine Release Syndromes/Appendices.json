To attenuate IL-6 signaling, the patient receives an intravenous infusion of tocilizumab, a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that competitively binds the Interleukin-6 Receptor (IL-6R) and prevents IL-6 from occupying the receptor. Assume that the relevant signaling occurs via IL-6 binding to a single receptor site on hepatocyte IL-6R, and that the receptor is in rapid binding equilibrium with two ligands—IL-6 and tocilizumab—competing for the same binding site.

Use the law of mass action and the definition $K_{D} = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]}$ to derive, from first principles, the equilibrium fraction of total receptor occupied by IL-6 in the presence of tocilizumab.

A false negative (FN) occurs when a patient has the condition ($Y=1$) but is classified as low-risk ($X < t$).\n\nThe total expected harm, or Bayes risk $R(t)$, is the sum of the probabilities of each type of error, weighted by their respective costs:\n$$R(t) = C_{\\mathrm{FP}} \\cdot \\Pr(X \\geq t \\mid Y=0)\\Pr(Y=0) + C_{\\mathrm{FN}} \\cdot \\Pr(X < t \\mid Y=1)\\Pr(Y=1)$$\nLet $f_0(x)$ and $f_1(x)$ be the probability density functions (PDFs) for the biomarker $X$ conditional on $Y=0$ and $Y=1$, respectively.
