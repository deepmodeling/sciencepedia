            "problem": "A patient with a total knee arthroplasty presents with suspected prosthetic joint infection. A sterile saline lavage was required to obtain synovial fluid. Prior to injection, point-of-care ultrasound estimated a native effusion volume of $3.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$. The operator then injected $10.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of sterile normal saline into the joint, mobilized the knee to mix thoroughly, and aspirated fluid.

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem that requires the calculation of a corrected white blood cell (WBC) count in native synovial fluid, accounting for multiple dilution and contamination effects.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Native effusion volume, $V_{nat} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Injected sterile saline volume, $V_{sal} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Aspirated fluid sample volume transferred to EDTA tube, $V_{asp} = 2.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Liquid anticoagulant volume in EDTA tube, $V_{EDTA} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$\n- Analyzer-reported synovial WBC count on the EDTA-treated mixture, $C_{WBC,an} = 3.90 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n- Analyzer-reported synovial RBC count on the EDTA-treated mixture, $C_{RBC,an} = 0.80 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n- Peripheral blood WBC count, $C_{WBC,p} = 6.50 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n- Peripheral blood RBC count, $C_{RBC,p} = 4.70 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n- Assumptions: complete mixing, analyzer reports concentration of its input mixture, RBCs in aspirate are due to traumatic tap and carry WBCs at the same ratio as peripheral blood, and native synovial fluid RBCs are negligible.\n- Objective: Calculate the corrected native synovial WBC concentration, $C_{WBC,nat}$, in cells/$\\mu$L.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the principle of conservation of mass (specifically, cell number) and dilution calculations. The method for correcting cell counts for blood contamination from a traumatic arthrocentesis is a standard, published procedure in clinical rheumatology and orthopedics. All principles are sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data and defines a clear, sequential path for calculation, leading to a unique numerical answer.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjectivity.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The data are self-contained and consistent. Volumes are provided in $\\mathrm{mL}$ and concentrations in $\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$, which is standard. The dilution calculations will involve ratios of volumes, making the units consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically-grounded problem in clinical data analysis. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Detailed Solution\nThe calculation proceeds by reversing the three processes described: (i) dilution in the EDTA tube, (ii) contamination with peripheral blood, and (iii) dilution by saline instillation.\n\n**Part (i): Correct for dilution by the EDTA tube additive**\n\nThe concentrations reported by the analyzer, $C_{WBC,an}$ and $C_{RBC,an}$, are from the sample diluted by the EDTA anticoagulant. The total volume in the tube is $V_{tube} = V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}$. The number of cells in this tube originated from the initial volume of aspirate, $V_{asp}$. Let $C_{WBC,asp}$ and $C_{RBC,asp}$ be the cell concentrations in the aspirate *before* addition to the EDTA tube.\nBy conservation of cell number, the number of WBCs is constant:\n$$N_{WBC} = C_{WBC,asp} \\times V_{asp} = C_{WBC,an} \\times (V_{asp} + V_{EDTA})$$\nSolving for the concentration in the undiluted aspirate:\n$$C_{WBC,asp} = C_{WBC,an} \\times \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$$\nSimilarly for RBCs:\n$$C_{RBC,asp} = C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$$\nThe term $\\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}}$ is the dilution factor for the EDTA tube, let's call it $D_{EDTA}$.\n\n**Part (ii): Subtract WBCs attributable to blood contamination**\n\nThe problem states that RBCs in the sample are from blood contamination and introduce WBCs at the same ratio as in peripheral blood. The ratio of WBCs to RBCs in peripheral blood is:\n$$R_{p} = \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}}$$\nThe concentration of WBCs in the aspirate that is due to this blood contamination, $C_{WBC,contam}$, is proportional to the RBC concentration in the aspirate:\n$$C_{WBC,contam} = C_{RBC,asp} \\times R_{p}$$\nThe true concentration of WBCs from synovial fluid within the aspirate, $C_{WBC,asp,true}$, is the total aspirate WBC count minus the contamination component:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = C_{WBC,asp} - C_{WBC,contam}$$\nSubstituting the expressions from Part (i) and the definitions above:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = \\left(C_{WBC,an} \\times D_{EDTA}\\right) - \\left(C_{RBC,an} \\times D_{EDTA} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}}\\right)$$\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = D_{EDTA} \\left( C_{WBC,an} - C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}} \\right)$$\n\n**Part (iii): Correct for dilution by intraarticular saline instillation**\n\nThe concentration $C_{WBC,asp,true}$ exists within the mixed fluid in the joint, which has a total volume of $V_{joint} = V_{nat} + V_{sal}$. These WBCs originated from the native synovial fluid, which had an initial volume $V_{nat}$ and concentration $C_{WBC,nat}$.\nBy conservation of cell number, the total number of native WBCs is constant:\n$$N_{WBC,nat} = C_{WBC,nat} \\times V_{nat}$$\nThis number of cells, when diluted into the volume $V_{joint}$, gives the concentration $C_{WBC,asp,true}$:\n$$C_{WBC,asp,true} = \\frac{N_{WBC,nat}}{V_{joint}} = \\frac{C_{WBC,nat} \\times V_{nat}}{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}$$\nSolving for the original native concentration, $C_{WBC,nat}$:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = C_{WBC,asp,true} \\times \\frac{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}{V_{nat}}$$\n\n**Combined Calculation**\n\nWe combine the equations from all parts to form a single expression for $C_{WBC,nat}$:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = \\left( \\frac{V_{nat} + V_{sal}}{V_{nat}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{V_{asp} + V_{EDTA}}{V_{asp}} \\right) \\times \\left( C_{WBC,an} - C_{RBC,an} \\times \\frac{C_{WBC,p}}{C_{RBC,p}} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$V_{nat} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{sal} = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{asp} = 2.80\\,\\mathrm{mL}, V_{EDTA} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n$$C_{WBC,an} = 3.90 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}, C_{RBC,an} = 0.80 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\n$$C_{WBC,p} = 6.50 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}, C_{RBC,p} = 4.70 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\n\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = \\left( \\frac{3.0 + 10.0}{3.0} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{2.80 + 0.20}{2.80} \\right) \\times \\left( 3.90 \\times 10^{3} - (0.80 \\times 10^{6}) \\times \\frac{6.50 \\times 10^{3}}{4.70 \\times 10^{6}} \\right)$$\nFirst, calculate the term for WBCs from blood contamination:\n$$(0.80 \\times 10^{6}) \\times \\frac{6.50 \\times 10^{3}}{4.70 \\times 10^{6}} = 800000 \\times \\frac{6500}{4700000} = 800000 \\times \\frac{6.5}{4700} = \\frac{5200000}{4700} = \\frac{52000}{47} \\approx 1106.383\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\nNext, calculate the corrected concentration in the analyzer's sample:\n$$C_{WBC,an} - C_{WBC,contam} = 3900 - 1106.383 = 2793.617\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\nNow, calculate the two dilution factors:\nSaline dilution factor: $D_{sal} = \\frac{13.0}{3.0} \\approx 4.3333$\nEDTA dilution factor: $D_{EDTA} = \\frac{3.00}{2.80} \\approx 1.0714$\nThe combined dilution factor is $D_{total} = D_{sal} \\times D_{EDTA} = \\frac{13.0}{3.0} \\times \\frac{3.00}{2.80} = \\frac{13.0}{2.80} \\approx 4.642857$\nFinally, calculate the native WBC concentration:\n$$C_{WBC,nat} = D_{total} \\times 2793.617 \\approx 4.642857 \\times 2793.617 \\approx 12970.3647\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{WBC,nat} \\approx 12970\\,\\text{cells}/\\mu\\text{L}$$",

The use of Bayes' theorem to update belief based on new evidence (inflammatory markers, molecular assay) is a standard and critical method in medical decision-making. The organism, *Cutibacterium acnes*, is well-known as a significant pathogen in prosthetic shoulder infections. The numerical values for prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are within a plausible range for real-world clinical scenarios. The problem is firmly grounded in scientific reality.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary information to compute a unique solution. The target quantity, a posterior probability, is well-defined. The use of conditional independence is explicitly stated, which is essential for combining the evidence.\n- **Objective:** The problem is expressed in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. It is free of subjective claims or opinions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective application of Bayesian probability theory. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posterior probability that *Cutibacterium acnes* is the causative organism, given the evidence of low inflammatory markers ($L$) and a positive molecular assay result ($T^+$). This probability is denoted as $P(C | L \\cap T^+)$.\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem, which states that for events $A$ and $B$:\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nIn this problem, the event $A$ is $C$ (the organism is *C. acnes*), and the event $B$ represents the combined evidence, $L \\cap T^+$. Therefore, Bayes' theorem takes the form:\n$$P(C | L \\cap T^+) = \\frac{P(L \\cap T^+ | C) P(C)}{P(L \\cap T^+)}$$\n\nThe denominator, $P(L \\cap T^+)$, is the total probability of observing the evidence. It can be expanded using the law of total probability over the partition of the sample space into $\\{C, C^c\\}$, where $C^c$ is the event that the organism is not *C. acnes*.\n$$P(L \\cap T^+) = P(L \\cap T^+ | C) P(C) + P(L \\cap T^+ | C^c) P(C^c)$$\n\nThe problem states that the inflammatory markers ($L$) and the molecular assay ($T^+$) are conditionally independent given the true causative organism. This means:\n$$P(L \\cap T^+ | C) = P(L|C) P(T^+|C)$$\n$$P(L \\cap T^+ | C^c) = P(L|C^c) P(T^+|C^c)$$\n\nSubstituting these into the expanded Bayes' theorem, we get the full expression for the posterior probability:\n$$P(C | L \\cap T^+) = \\frac{P(L|C) P(T^+|C) P(C)}{P(L|C) P(T^+|C) P(C) + P(L|C^c) P(T^+|C^c) P(C^c)}$$\n\nWe are given the following probabilities:\n- The prior probability of *C. acnes*: $P(C) = 0.45$.\n- The prior probability of another organism is therefore $P(C^c) = 1 - P(C) = 1 - 0.45 = 0.55$.\n- The probability of low inflammatory markers given *C. acnes*: $P(L|C) = 0.70$.\n- The probability of low inflammatory markers given another organism: $P(L|C^c) = 0.30$.\n- The sensitivity of the assay (true positive rate): $P(T^+|C) = 0.85$.\n- The specificity of the assay (true negative rate) is $P(T^-|C^c) = 0.95$. From this, we derive the false positive rate: $P(T^+|C^c) = 1 - P(T^-|C^c) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the formula.\nFirst, we calculate the numerator term, which represents the joint probability of the evidence and the hypothesis $C$:\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = P(L|C) P(T^+|C) P(C) = (0.70) \\times (0.85) \\times (0.45) $$\n$$ \\text{Numerator} = 0.595 \\times 0.45 = 0.26775 $$\n\nNext, we calculate the term in the denominator corresponding to the alternative hypothesis, $C^c$:\n$$ P(L|C^c) P(T^+|C^c) P(C^c) = (0.30) \\times (0.05) \\times (0.55) $$\n$$ = 0.015 \\times 0.55 = 0.00825 $$\n\nThe denominator is the sum of these two terms, representing the total probability of the evidence $P(L \\cap T^+)$:\n$$ \\text{Denominator} = 0.26775 + 0.00825 = 0.276 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability:\n$$ P(C | L \\cap T^+) = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}}{\\text{Denominator}} = \\frac{0.26775}{0.276} $$\n$$ P(C | L \\cap T^+) \\approx 0.97010869565... $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain $0.9701$.",
