            "problem": "A candidate for Solid Organ Transplant (SOT) is undergoing pretransplant screening for Latent Tuberculosis Infection (LTBI). The immunologic assay used is an Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA). In immunosuppressed patients, the IGRA has sensitivity $S$ and specificity $C$.

The variables and their assigned values are plausible for the clinical scenario described (LTBI screening in an immunosuppressed patient). The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided to answer the questions posed. The language is objective and the tasks are well-defined. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or reliance on pseudoscience. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will now be provided.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has LTBI, and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not have LTBI. Let $T^+$ denote a positive test result and $T^-$ denote a negative test result.\n\nThe givens can be expressed as:\n- $P(D) = p = 0.20$\n- $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$\n- Sensitivity: $P(T^+|D) = S = 0.75$\n- Specificity: $P(T^-|D^c) = C = 0.98$\n\nFrom these, we can derive the probabilities of false results:\n- False positive rate: $P(T^+|D^c) = 1 - P(T^-|D^c) = 1 - C = 1 - 0.98 = 0.02$\n- False negative rate: $P(T^-|D) = 1 - P(T^+|D) = 1 - S = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$\n\n**Task 1: Posterior Probabilities**\n\nThe posterior probability of LTBI given a positive test, $P(D|T^+)$, is calculated using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+|D)P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^+)$, is the total probability of a positive test, found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+|D)P(D) + P(T^+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the symbolic representations:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{S \\cdot p}{S \\cdot p + (1-C)(1-p)}$$\nNow, substituting the numerical values:\n$$P(D|T^+) = \\frac{(0.75)(0.20)}{(0.75)(0.20) + (1-0.98)(1-0.20)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.15 + (0.02)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.15 + 0.016} = \\frac{0.15}{0.166} \\approx 0.903614$$\n\nThe posterior probability of LTBI given a negative test, $P(D|T^-)$, is also calculated using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{P(T^-|D)P(D)}{P(T^-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T^-)$, is the total probability of a negative test:\n$$P(T^-) = P(T^-|D)P(D) + P(T^-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nSubstituting the symbolic representations:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1-S) \\cdot p}{(1-S) \\cdot p + C(1-p)}$$\nNow, substituting the numerical values:\n$$P(D|T^-) = \\frac{(1-0.75)(0.20)}{(1-0.75)(0.20) + (0.98)(1-0.20)} = \\frac{(0.25)(0.20)}{0.05 + (0.98)(0.80)} = \\frac{0.05}{0.05 + 0.784} = \\frac{0.05}{0.834} \\approx 0.059952$$\n\n**Task 2: Decision Threshold**\n\nThe decision to treat is based on comparing the expected disutility of treating versus not treating. Let $P_{post}$ be the posterior probability of LTBI after a test. The decision threshold, $t$, is the value of $P_{post}$ at which the expected disutilities of the two actions are equal. Let $U_{TB}$ be the disutility of an active tuberculosis event and $U_{tox}$ be the disutility of a serious prophylaxis-related adverse event. We are given $U_{tox} = w \\cdot U_{TB}$. We can normalize by setting $U_{TB} = 1$, which makes $U_{tox} = w$.\n\nThe expected disutility of withholding treatment, $E_{withhold}$, is the probability of having LTBI multiplied by the risk of progression:\n$$E_{withhold} = P_{post} \\cdot r \\cdot U_{TB} = P_{post} \\cdot r$$\n\nThe expected disutility of treating, $E_{treat}$, has two components: the disutility from potential drug toxicity and the disutility from the residual risk of developing active TB despite treatment. The risk of a serious adverse event, $h$, is independent of disease status. The risk of progression for a patient with LTBI who is treated is $r(1-R)$.\n$$E_{treat} = (h \\cdot U_{tox}) + (P_{post} \\cdot r(1-R) \\cdot U_{TB}) = h \\cdot w + P_{post} \\cdot r(1-R)$$\n\nAt the threshold $t$, $E_{treat} = E_{withhold}$:\n$$h \\cdot w + t \\cdot r(1-R) = t \\cdot r$$\nSolving for $t$:\n$$h \\cdot w = t \\cdot r - t \\cdot r(1-R)$$\n$$h \\cdot w = t \\cdot r (1 - (1-R))$$\n$$h \\cdot w = t \\cdot r \\cdot R$$\n$$t = \\frac{h \\cdot w}{r \\cdot R}$$\nThis formula represents the ratio of the expected harm of treatment to the benefit of treatment (risk reduction).\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$t = \\frac{(0.01)(0.25)}{(0.06)(0.65)} = \\frac{0.0025}{0.039} \\approx 0.064103$$\n\n**Task 3: Treatment Decisions**\n\nTreatment is justified if the posterior probability of LTBI, $P_{post}$, exceeds the decision threshold $t$.\n\n- **After a positive IGRA:**\nThe posterior probability is $P(D|T^+) \\approx 0.9036$.\nComparing this to the threshold: $0.9036 > 0.0641$.\nTherefore, treatment is justified after a positive IGRA. The justification is that the patient's posterior probability of having LTBI ($0.9036$) is substantially greater than the treatment threshold ($0.0641$), indicating the expected benefit of preventing tuberculosis outweighs the expected harm from drug toxicity.\n\n- **After a negative IGRA:**\nThe posterior probability is $P(D|T^-) \\approx 0.0600$.\nComparing this to the threshold: $0.0600 < 0.0641$.\nTherefore, treatment is not justified after a negative IGRA. The justification is that the patient's posterior probability of having LTBI ($0.0600$) falls below the treatment threshold ($0.0641$), indicating the expected harm from drug toxicity outweighs the expected benefit of preventing tuberculosis.",

Next, determine whether the intervention has achieved control relative to the predefined targets by evaluating both criteria.\n\nReport as your final answer only the computed pre-intervention viral load doubling time in days. Round your answer to three significant figures. Express the final result in days.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze viral load kinetics in a transplant recipient using an exponential model. This involves deriving the formula for doubling time, calculating the pre-intervention doubling time, and evaluating whether post-intervention control targets were met.\n\nThe fundamental assumption is that the viral load, $V(t)$, follows an exponential kinetic process over the specified time windows. This can be described by the differential equation $\\frac{dV}{dt} = kV$, where $k$ is the rate constant. The solution to this equation is the exponential model:\n$$V(t) = V(t_0) \\exp(k(t - t_0))$$\nwhere $V(t_0)$ is the viral load at a reference time $t_0$. For viral growth, $k > 0$, and for viral decay, $k < 0$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Doubling Time Expression**\nFirst, we derive an expression for the rate constant $k$ using two data points, $(t_1, V_1)$ and $(t_2, V_2)$, where $V_1 = V(t_1)$ and $V_2 = V(t_2)$.\nFrom the model, we have:\n$$V_2 = V_1 \\exp(k(t_2 - t_1))$$\nTo solve for $k$, we first divide by $V_1$:\n$$\\frac{V_2}{V_1} = \\exp(k(t_2 - t_1))$$\nNext, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) = k(t_2 - t_1)$$\nThis gives the expression for the rate constant $k$, which is the slope of the line on a log-linear plot of viral load versus time:\n$$k = \\frac{\\ln(V_2) - \\ln(V_1)}{t_2 - t_1}$$\nThe doubling time, denoted as $T_2$, is defined as the time interval over which the viral load doubles. That is, $V(t + T_2) = 2V(t)$. Using the exponential model:\n$$V(t_0) \\exp(k(t + T_2 - t_0)) = 2 \\cdot V(t_0) \\exp(k(t - t_0))$$\nDividing both sides by $V(t_0) \\exp(k(t - t_0))$ yields:\n$$\\exp(kT_2) = 2$$\nTaking the natural logarithm, we find the relationship between $k$ and $T_2$:\n$$kT_2 = \\ln(2)$$\n$$T_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $k$ derived from two data points, we obtain the required expression for the doubling time:\n$$T_2 = \\frac{\\ln(2)(t_2 - t_1)}{\\ln(V_2) - \\ln(V_1)}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Pre-intervention Doubling Time**\nThe pre-intervention period is from day $0$ to day $14$. We use the viral load measurements at the start and end of this interval to calculate the overall rate of growth.\nLet $t_1 = 0$ days and $t_2 = 14$ days.\nThe corresponding viral loads are $V_1 = 2.0 \\times 10^3$ copies/mL and $V_2 = 3.2 \\times 10^4$ copies/mL.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pre-intervention rate constant, $k_{pre}$:\n$$k_{pre} = \\frac{\\ln(3.2 \\times 10^4) - \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^3)}{14 - 0} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3.2 \\times 10^4}{2.0 \\times 10^3}\\right)}{14} = \\frac{\\ln(16)}{14}$$\nNow, we calculate the pre-intervention doubling time, $T_{2, pre}$:\n$$T_{2, pre} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k_{pre}} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{\\frac{\\ln(16)}{14}} = \\frac{14 \\ln(2)}{\\ln(16)}$$\nSince $\\ln(16) = \\ln(2^4) = 4 \\ln(2)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$T_{2, pre} = \\frac{14 \\ln(2)}{4 \\ln(2)} = \\frac{14}{4} = 3.5 \\text{ days}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to three significant figures, so the doubling time is $3.50$ days.\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Post-intervention Control Targets**\nWe must now evaluate whether the intervention was successful based on the two predefined targets.\n\n**Target (i):** The plasma BKPyV load should be below $1.0 \\times 10^4$ copies/mL by day $28$.\nThe data provided shows that at day $28$, the measured viral load was $7.9 \\times 10^3$ copies/mL.\nWe compare this value to the target:\n$$7.9 \\times 10^3 < 1.0 \\times 10^4$$\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, the first control target was met.\n\n**Target (ii):** The post-intervention decay should correspond to a halving time less than or equal to $10$ days, estimated from the log-linear slope between day $14$ and day $35$.\nThe derivation for halving time, $T_{1/2}$, is analogous to that for doubling time. It is defined by $V(t + T_{1/2}) = \\frac{1}{2}V(t)$, which leads to the relation:\n$$T_{1/2} = \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nNote that for decay, $k$ is negative, so $T_{1/2}$ is positive.\n\nWe calculate the post-intervention rate constant, $k_{post}$, using the data from day $t_i = 14$ and day $t_f = 35$.\n$V_i = V(14) = 3.2 \\times 10^4$ copies/mL.\n$V_f = V(35) = 3.9 \\times 10^3$ copies/mL.\n$$k_{post} = \\frac{\\ln(V_f) - \\ln(V_i)}{t_f - t_i} = \\frac{\\ln(3.9 \\times 10^3) - \\ln(3.2 \\times 10^4)}{35 - 14}$$\n$$k_{post} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{3.9 \\times 10^3}{3.2 \\times 10^4}\\right)}{21} = \\frac{\\ln(0.121875)}{21}$$\nNumerically, $\\ln(0.121875) \\approx -2.10476$, so:\n$$k_{post} \\approx \\frac{-2.10476}{21} \\approx -0.100227 \\text{ day}^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate the post-intervention halving time, $T_{1/2, post}$:\n$$T_{1/2, post} = \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{k_{post}} \\approx \\frac{-0.69315}{-0.100227} \\approx 6.915 \\text{ days}$$\nThe target is $T_{1/2, post} \\le 10$ days. Since $6.915 \\le 10$, the second control target was also met.\n\nBoth post-intervention control targets were successfully achieved.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution consists of two parts: first, the calculation of the posterior probability of invasive aspergillosis, and second, the application of the decision rule to guide clinical action.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Posterior Probability**\n\nWe will use Bayes' theorem in the odds-likelihood formulation, as specified. The relationship is:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\text{Likelihood Ratio}\n$$\nThe pretest probability of disease is given as $p = P(D) = 0.30$. The pretest probability of no disease is $P(D^c) = 1 - p = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the pretest odds:\n$$\n\\text{Pretest Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{p}{1-p} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the likelihood ratio ($\\mathrm{LR}$) for the observed Galactomannan index, $G = 1.8$. The model is given by $\\mathrm{LR}(G) = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta G)$. Substituting the given constants $\\alpha = -1.2$ and $\\beta = 1.6$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}(G=1.8) = \\exp(-1.2 + (1.6)(1.8))\n$$\nWe calculate the exponent:\n$$\n-1.2 + (1.6)(1.8) = -1.2 + 2.88 = 1.68\n$$\nThus, the likelihood ratio is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{LR}(1.8) = \\exp(1.68)\n$$\nNow, we can compute the posterior odds:\n$$\n\\text{Posterior Odds} = \\text{Pretest Odds} \\times \\mathrm{LR}(1.8) = \\frac{3}{7} \\times \\exp(1.68)\n$$\nTo obtain the posterior probability, $P_{post} = P(D|G=1.8)$, we use the formula that converts odds to probability:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{\\text{Posterior Odds}}{1 + \\text{Posterior Odds}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for posterior odds:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{7} \\exp(1.68)}{1 + \\frac{3}{7} \\exp(1.68)}\n$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $7$:\n$$\nP_{post} = \\frac{3 \\exp(1.68)}{7 + 3 \\exp(1.68)}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\exp(1.68) \\approx 5.365555\n$$\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx \\frac{3 \\times 5.365555}{7 + 3 \\times 5.365555} = \\frac{16.096665}{7 + 16.096665} = \\frac{16.096665}{23.096665} \\approx 0.696923\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, the posterior probability is:\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx 0.6969\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Application of the Decision Rule**\n\nThe decision to start empiric therapy is based on a threshold probability, $P_T$, at which the expected harm (or loss) of treating equals the expected harm of not treating (deferring).\n\nThe expected harm of deferring therapy is the harm of a false negative decision ($C_{FN}$) multiplied by the probability that the patient actually has the disease ($P_{post}$):\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm(Defer)}] = C_{FN} \\times P_{post}\n$$\nThe problem states that the expected harm of empiric therapy is a constant value $C_T$. This is a simplification, but we must adhere to the problem's formulation.\n$$\nE[\\text{Harm(Treat)}] = C_{T}\n$$\nThe decision threshold $P_T$ is the probability where these two expected harms are equal:\n$$\nC_{FN} \\times P_T = C_{T}\n$$\nSolving for $P_T$:\n$$\nP_T = \\frac{C_T}{C_{FN}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $C_T = 0.08$ and $C_{FN} = 0.60$:\n$$\nP_T = \\frac{0.08}{0.60} = \\frac{8}{60} = \\frac{2}{15} \\approx 0.1333\n$$\nThe decision rule is to initiate therapy if the posterior probability of disease, $P_{post}$, exceeds this threshold, as this indicates that the expected harm of deferring therapy is greater than the expected harm of treating.\n$$\n\\text{Treat if } P_{post} > P_T\n$$\nWe compare our calculated posterior probability to this threshold:\n$$\nP_{post} \\approx 0.6969\n$$\n$$\nP_T \\approx 0.1333\n$$\nClearly, $0.6969 > 0.1333$.\n\n**Justification:**\nThe calculated posterior probability of invasive aspergillosis, $P_{post} \\approx 0.6969$, is substantially greater than the decision threshold, $P_T \\approx 0.1333$. This means that the expected harm of deferring therapy ($C_{FN} \\times P_{post} \\approx 0.60 \\times 0.6969 \\approx 0.418$) is significantly higher than the expected harm of initiating empiric therapy ($C_T = 0.08$). Therefore, according to the specified Bayes decision rule which aims to minimize expected harm, the posterior probability crosses the decision threshold, and the correct action is to start empiric mold-active antifungal therapy.",
