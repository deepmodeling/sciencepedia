            "problem": "A bacterial population of susceptible cells grows exponentially with per-capita rate $r$ until the initiation of therapy at time $t=0$. Mutations to phage resistance occur during susceptible cell divisions with a per-division mutation probability $\\mu$, and resistant mutants, once formed, are unaffected by phage. An antivirulence agent that does not kill bacteria but slows their growth is administered prior to phage therapy; as a result, the net bacterial growth rate prior to phage therapy is reduced from a baseline of $1.0\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$ to $r=0.70\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$. A lytic bacteriophage is then administered at $t=0$ at an initial phage-to-bacteria ratio (multiplicity of infection, defined here as the ratio of initial phage count to initial susceptible bacterial count) $R=P_{0}/S_{0}$.\n\nAssume the following scientifically grounded and standard foundations:\n- Susceptible bacteria follow exponential growth in the absence of phage, $\\frac{dS}{dt}=r S$, and exponential decline under sufficiently strong phage pressure, $\\frac{dS}{dt}=(r-k_{0}) S$, where $k_{0}$ is a constant per-capita removal rate due to phage adsorption during the short early phase of therapy.\n- Phage adsorption follows mass action with adsorption coefficient $\\phi$ so that $k_{0}=\\phi C_{P0}$, where $C_{P0}$ is the initial phage concentration. If the initial phage count is $P_{0}$ in a well-mixed volume $V$, then $C_{P0}=P_{0}/V$, hence $k_{0}=\\phi P_{0}/V$.\n- The Luria–Delbrück framework: mutation to resistance occurs at divisions with probability $\\mu$ per division. Over any time interval, the number of mutation events is modeled as a Poisson process whose mean equals $\\mu$ times the total number of susceptible cell divisions in that interval. Therefore, the probability of zero mutation events in a given interval equals $\\exp(-\\mu \\times \\text{total divisions})$. For independent, nonoverlapping intervals, zero-event probabilities multiply.\n\nYou are given the following parameters:\n- Mutation probability per division: $\\mu=1.0\\times 10^{-8}$.\n- Adsorption coefficient: $\\phi=2.0\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Volume: $V=1.0\\,\\mathrm{mL}$.\n- Initial susceptible count at therapy start: $S_{0}=2.0\\times 10^{6}$ cells.\n- Founding susceptible population prior to growth: $N_{i}=1.0\\times 10^{3}$ cells.\n- Net susceptible growth rate under antivirulence action: $r=0.70\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- Phage are introduced at $t=0$ with initial count $P_{0}=R S_{0}$ and remain approximately at the initial concentration during the initial elimination phase so that $k_{0}=\\phi P_{0}/V$ can be treated as constant.\n\nDefine “resistance emergence” as the existence of at least one resistant bacterium at any time during or before therapy. Using only the above foundations, derive an analytic expression for the probability that resistance emerges by the end of the initial elimination phase, expressed in terms of $\\mu$, $r$, $S_{0}$, $N_{i}$, $\\phi$, $V$, and $R$.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Probability of Resistance Emergence\n\nThe emergence of resistance is defined as the presence of at least one resistant bacterium. It is simpler to calculate the probability of the complementary event: no resistant bacteria emerging. Let this probability be $P(\\text{no res})$. The probability of resistance emergence, $P(\\text{res})$, is then $1 - P(\\text{no res})$.\n\nAccording to the Luria–Delbrück framework, the probability of zero mutation events is given by $P(0) = \\exp(-\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of mutation events. The total mean number of mutations, $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the mean mutations occurring during the pre-therapy growth phase ($\\lambda_{\\text{pre}}$) and the initial therapy phase ($\\lambda_{\\text{post}}$), as these are independent processes.\n$$P(\\text{no res}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}}) = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{pre}} + \\lambda_{\\text{post}}))$$\n\n**1. Mutations during Pre-Therapy Growth (t  0):**\nThe susceptible population grows exponentially from an initial size $N_i$ to $S_0$ at $t=0$, governed by $\\frac{dS}{dt} = rS$. The rate of cell divisions per unit time is $rS(t)$. The total number of divisions, $N_{\\text{div,pre}}$, over this growth period is the integral of the division rate over time. A simpler approach is to note that for every net increase in population size, one division must have occurred. Thus, the total number of new cells (and hence divisions) is the final population minus the initial population.\n$$N_{\\text{div,pre}} = S_0 - N_i$$\nThe mean number of mutation events in this phase is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{pre}} = \\mu \\times N_{\\text{div,pre}} = \\mu (S_0 - N_i)$$\n\n**2. Mutations during Initial Therapy Phase (t ≥ 0):**\nAt $t=0$, phage therapy begins. The susceptible population dynamics is now $\\frac{dS}{dt} = (r-k_0)S$. For elimination to occur, phage pressure must be \"sufficiently strong,\" meaning the net rate of change is negative, i.e., $k_0 > r$. Let $\\delta = k_0 - r > 0$ be the net clearance rate.\nThe population size over time is $S(t) = S_0 \\exp(-\\delta t)$.\nDuring this phase, cells are being cleared, but they are also still attempting to divide at a per-capita rate $r$. The rate of cell divisions is $rS(t)$. The total number of divisions during the entire elimination phase ($t \\in [0, \\infty)$) is:\n$$N_{\\text{div,post}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} rS(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} rS_0 \\exp(-(k_0-r)t) dt$$\n$$N_{\\text{div,post}} = rS_0 \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(-(k_0-r)t)}{-(k_0-r)} \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = rS_0 \\left( 0 - \\frac{1}{-(k_0-r)} \\right) = \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r}$$\nThe mean number of mutation events in this phase is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{post}} = \\mu \\times N_{\\text{div,post}} = \\mu \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r}$$\nThe phage killing rate $k_0$ is given by $k_0 = \\phi C_{P0} = \\phi(P_0/V)$. Substituting $P_0 = RS_0$, we get:\n$$k_0 = \\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V}$$\n\n**3. Analytic Expression for $P(\\text{res})$:**\nCombining the terms, the total mean number of mutations is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = \\mu (S_0 - N_i) + \\mu \\frac{rS_0}{k_0-r} = \\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)$$\nThe probability of no resistance is $P(\\text{no res}) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}})$.\nTherefore, the probability of resistance emergence is:\n$$P(\\text{res}) = 1 - P(\\text{no res}) = 1 - \\exp\\left[-\\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)\\right]$$\nThis is the required analytic expression.\n\n### Calculation of the Minimum Phage-to-Bacteria Ratio R\n\nWe are tasked to find the minimum value of $R$ such that the probability of resistance emergence is strictly below $0.05$.\n$$P(\\text{res})  0.05$$\n$$1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}})  0.05$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{total}}) > 0.95$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda_{\\text{total}} > \\ln(0.95)$$\n$$\\lambda_{\\text{total}}  -\\ln(0.95)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\\mu \\left( (S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r} \\right)  -\\ln(0.95)$$\nLet's solve for $R$.\n$$(S_0 - N_i) + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu}$$\n$$\\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)$$\nLet $X = \\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)$. The inequality is $\\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r}  X$.\nFor this to hold, the denominator on the left must be positive and sufficiently large.\n$$\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} - r > \\frac{rS_0}{X}$$\n$$\\frac{\\phi R S_0}{V} > r + \\frac{rS_0}{X}$$\n$$R > \\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} \\left( r + \\frac{rS_0}{X} \\right)$$\n$$R > \\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} \\left( r + \\frac{rS_0}{\\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} - (S_0 - N_i)} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- $S_0 = 2.0 \\times 10^6$\n- $N_i = 1.0 \\times 10^3$\n- $r = 0.70 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $\\phi = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- $V = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term in the denominator of the nested fraction:\n$$\\frac{-\\ln(0.95)}{\\mu} = \\frac{-(-0.05129329...)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}} \\approx 5.12933 \\times 10^6$$\n$$S_0 - N_i = 2.0 \\times 10^6 - 1.0 \\times 10^3 = 1.999 \\times 10^6$$\nSo, $X = 5.12933 \\times 10^6 - 1.999 \\times 10^6 = 3.13033 \\times 10^6$.\n\nNow calculate the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$r + \\frac{rS_0}{X} = 0.70 + \\frac{0.70 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6)}{3.13033 \\times 10^6} \\approx 0.70 + 0.44723 = 1.14723 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the pre-factor:\n$$\\frac{V}{\\phi S_0} = \\frac{1.0 \\, \\mathrm{mL}}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\, \\mathrm{mL}\\,\\mathrm{PFU}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ cells})} = \\frac{1.0}{4.0 \\times 10^{-3}} \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}} = 250 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}}$$\n\nCombining these results to find the lower bound for $R$:\n$$R > 250 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU} \\cdot \\mathrm{h}}{\\text{cell}} \\times 1.14723 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1} \\approx 286.808 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{PFU}}{\\text{cell}}$$\n\nThe value of $R$ must be strictly greater than $286.808$. The problem asks for the minimum value of $R$, rounded to three significant figures, that ensures the condition. Any value $R \\le 286.808$ will result in $P(\\text{res}) \\ge 0.05$. Therefore, we must select a value of $R$ that, when rounded, represents a number greater than this critical threshold. The value $286.808$ rounded to three significant figures is $287$. This value is greater than the critical threshold and satisfies the condition.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\nThe minimum phage-to-bacteria ratio $R$ must satisfy $R > 286.808...$.\nRounding this threshold to three significant figures gives $287$. Let's verify $R = 287$:\n$k_0 = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(287)(2.0 \\times 10^6)}{1.0} = 1.148 \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{total}} = 10^{-8} \\left( 1.999 \\times 10^6 + \\frac{0.70 \\times 2.0 \\times 10^6}{1.148 - 0.70} \\right) = 10^{-8} \\left( 1.999 \\times 10^6 + \\frac{1.4 \\times 10^6}{0.448} \\right) \\approx 10^{-8} (1.999 \\times 10^6 + 3.125 \\times 10^6) = 0.05124$\n$P(\\text{res}) = 1 - \\exp(-0.05124) \\approx 0.04998  0.05$.\nThe condition is satisfied for $R=287$.

By defining and maximizing an expected utility function that balances therapeutic benefits against the risk of driving resistance, you will derive an optimal, evidence-based allocation strategy, a key skill for developing adaptive and personalized therapeutic approaches .",

            "problem": "A clinician must initiate empiric bacteriophage therapy before complete strain characterization is available. The infecting bacterial population comprises two phenotypic subpopulations: those expressing receptor $A$ and those expressing receptor $B$. Let $\\theta \\in [0,1]$ denote the (unknown) fraction of the population expressing receptor $A$; the fraction expressing receptor $B$ is $1 - \\theta$. The prior belief about $\\theta$ is modeled by a Beta distribution with shape parameters $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  0$, that is, $\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\n\nTwo strictly lytic bacteriophages are available: phage $P_A$ that adsorbs to receptor $A$ with probability $a_A \\in (0,1)$ upon encounter, and phage $P_B$ that adsorbs to receptor $B$ with probability $a_B \\in (0,1)$. An empiric cocktail is defined by allocating a fraction $x \\in [0,1]$ of the fixed total phage dose to $P_A$ and the remaining fraction $1-x$ to $P_B$.\n\nTherapeutic utility is modeled as the sum of three components grounded in standard infectious disease reasoning:\n- Immediate burden reduction proportional to expected successful adsorption events: $b \\left[ x\\, a_A\\, \\theta + (1-x)\\, a_B\\, (1-\\theta) \\right]$, where $b0$ scales clinical benefit per adsorption.\n- Antivirulence suppression proportional to receptor-targeted interference with virulence factor expression: $\\lambda \\left[ x\\, v_A\\, \\theta + (1-x)\\, v_B\\, (1-\\theta) \\right]$, where $\\lambda0$ weights antivirulence relative to burden reduction, and $v_A \\ge 0$, $v_B \\ge 0$ quantify per-infection suppression efficacy on the respective subpopulations.\n- A resistance risk penalty growing quadratically with within-subpopulation phage allocation (reflecting dose-dependent selective pressure): $-c \\left[ x^{2}\\, r_A\\, \\theta + (1-x)^{2}\\, r_B\\, (1-\\theta) \\right]$, where $c0$ weights resistance costs, and $r_A0$, $r_B0$ scale receptor-specific resistance hazard.\n\nUsing Bayesian decision theory and beginning from first principles of expected utility maximization under uncertainty, derive the Bayes-optimal empiric allocation $x^{\\ast}$ that maximizes the prior-expected therapeutic utility over $x \\in [0,1]$. Assume parameters satisfy $r_A0$, $r_B0$, $c0$, $a_A \\in (0,1)$, $a_B \\in (0,1)$, $b0$, $\\lambda0$, $v_A \\ge 0$, $v_B \\ge 0$, and that the unconstrained maximizer lies strictly in the interior $\\left(0,1\\right)$ of the feasible set. Express $x^{\\ast}$ in closed form in terms of $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $a_A$, $a_B$, $v_A$, $v_B$, $b$, $\\lambda$, $c$, $r_A$, and $r_B$. The final answer must be a single analytic expression for $x^{\\ast}$ and should be given as a dimensionless fraction with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the Bayes-optimal allocation fraction, $x^{\\ast}$, for a phage cocktail. The optimization is based on maximizing the expected therapeutic utility under uncertainty about the bacterial population composition.\n\nThe therapeutic utility, $U(x, \\theta)$, for a given allocation fraction $x$ and a given population fraction $\\theta$ expressing receptor $A$, is stated as the sum of three components:\n$1$. Immediate burden reduction: $b \\left[ x a_A \\theta + (1-x) a_B (1-\\theta) \\right]$\n$2$. Antivirulence suppression: $\\lambda \\left[ x v_A \\theta + (1-x) v_B (1-\\theta) \\right]$\n$3$. Resistance risk penalty: $-c \\left[ x^2 r_A \\theta + (1-x)^2 r_B (1-\\theta) \\right]$\n\nThe total utility function is the sum of these components:\n$$U(x, \\theta) = b \\left[ x a_A \\theta + (1-x) a_B (1-\\theta) \\right] + \\lambda \\left[ x v_A \\theta + (1-x) v_B (1-\\theta) \\right] - c \\left[ x^2 r_A \\theta + (1-x)^2 r_B (1-\\theta) \\right]$$\nTo facilitate the analysis, we can regroup the terms based on the subpopulations $\\theta$ and $1-\\theta$:\n$$U(x, \\theta) = \\theta \\left[ b x a_A + \\lambda x v_A - c x^2 r_A \\right] + (1-\\theta) \\left[ b (1-x) a_B + \\lambda (1-x) v_B - c (1-x)^2 r_B \\right]$$\nThe parameter $\\theta$ is unknown. According to Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision $x^{\\ast}$ is the one that maximizes the expected utility, where the expectation is taken over the prior distribution of the unknown parameter $\\theta$. The problem specifies that the prior belief about $\\theta$ is a Beta distribution, $\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$.\n\nThe objective is to find $x^{\\ast} = \\arg\\max_{x \\in [0,1]} \\bar{U}(x)$, where $\\bar{U}(x)$ is the expected utility:\n$$\\bar{U}(x) = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[U(x, \\theta)]$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, we can write:\n$$\\bar{U}(x) = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta \\left[ \\theta \\left( b x a_A + \\lambda x v_A - c x^2 r_A \\right) \\right] + \\mathbb{E}_\\theta \\left[ (1-\\theta) \\left( b (1-x) a_B + \\lambda (1-x) v_B - c (1-x)^2 r_B \\right) \\right]$$\nThe terms in the parentheses are functions of $x$ but constant with respect to $\\theta$, so we can factor them out of the expectation:\n$$\\bar{U}(x) = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[\\theta] \\left( b x a_A + \\lambda x v_A - c x^2 r_A \\right) + \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[1-\\theta] \\left( b (1-x) a_B + \\lambda (1-x) v_B - c (1-x)^2 r_B \\right)$$\nFor a random variable $\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha, \\beta)$, the mean or expected value is a standard result:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_\\theta[\\theta] = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta}$$\nConsequently, the expectation of $1-\\theta$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_\\theta[1-\\theta] = 1 - \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[\\theta] = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + \\beta} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha + \\beta}$$\nLet's denote $\\mu_\\theta = \\mathbb{E}_\\theta[\\theta]$. The expected utility is:\n$$\\bar{U}(x) = \\mu_\\theta \\left[ x(b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - c x^2 r_A \\right] + (1-\\mu_\\theta) \\left[ (1-x)(b a_B + \\lambda v_B) - c (1-x)^2 r_B \\right]$$\nTo find the value of $x$ that maximizes this function, we compute its derivative with respect to $x$ and set it to zero. This provides the first-order condition for a maximum.\n$$\\frac{d\\bar{U}}{dx} = \\mu_\\theta \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ x(b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - c x^2 r_A \\right] + (1-\\mu_\\theta) \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[ (1-x)(b a_B + \\lambda v_B) - c (1-x)^2 r_B \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{d\\bar{U}}{dx} = \\mu_\\theta \\left( b a_A + \\lambda v_A - 2 c x r_A \\right) + (1-\\mu_\\theta) \\left( -(b a_B + \\lambda v_B) - 2c(1-x)(-1)r_B \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{d\\bar{U}}{dx} = \\mu_\\theta \\left( b a_A + \\lambda v_A - 2 c x r_A \\right) - (1-\\mu_\\theta) \\left( b a_B + \\lambda v_B - 2c(1-x)r_B \\right)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero for the optimal allocation $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\mu_\\theta \\left( b a_A + \\lambda v_A - 2 c x^{\\ast} r_A \\right) = (1-\\mu_\\theta) \\left( b a_B + \\lambda v_B - 2c(1-x^{\\ast})r_B \\right)$$\nThe second derivative of $\\bar{U}(x)$ is:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\bar{U}}{dx^2} = \\mu_\\theta(-2 c r_A) - (1-\\mu_\\theta)(-2c(-1)r_B) = -2c(\\mu_\\theta r_A + (1-\\mu_\\theta) r_B)$$\nGiven that $c0$, $r_A0$, $r_B0$, and $\\mu_\\theta \\in [0,1]$, the term $(\\mu_\\theta r_A + (1-\\mu_\\theta) r_B)$ is strictly positive. Thus, $\\frac{d^2\\bar{U}}{dx^2}  0$, which confirms that $\\bar{U}(x)$ is a strictly concave function of $x$, and the critical point found by setting the first derivative to zero is a unique global maximum. The problem assumes this unconstrained maximizer lies in $(0,1)$, so we solve for $x^{\\ast}$ directly.\n\nSubstituting $\\mu_\\theta = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}$ and $1-\\mu_\\theta = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}$ into the first-order condition:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\left( b a_A + \\lambda v_A - 2 c x^{\\ast} r_A \\right) = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\left( b a_B + \\lambda v_B - 2c(1-x^{\\ast})r_B \\right)$$\nMultiplying both sides by $(\\alpha+\\beta)$:\n$$\\alpha \\left( b a_A + \\lambda v_A - 2 c x^{\\ast} r_A \\right) = \\beta \\left( b a_B + \\lambda v_B - 2c(1-x^{\\ast})r_B \\right)$$\nNow we algebraicly solve for $x^{\\ast}$. Expand both sides:\n$$\\alpha (b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - 2 c \\alpha r_A x^{\\ast} = \\beta (b a_B + \\lambda v_B) - 2 c \\beta r_B + 2 c \\beta r_B x^{\\ast}$$\nGroup all terms containing $x^{\\ast}$ on one side:\n$$\\alpha (b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - \\beta (b a_B + \\lambda v_B) + 2 c \\beta r_B = 2 c \\alpha r_A x^{\\ast} + 2 c \\beta r_B x^{\\ast}$$\nFactor out $x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\alpha (b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - \\beta (b a_B + \\lambda v_B) + 2 c \\beta r_B = x^{\\ast} \\left( 2 c \\alpha r_A + 2 c \\beta r_B \\right)$$\n$$x^{\\ast} \\left( 2 c (\\alpha r_A + \\beta r_B) \\right) = \\alpha (b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - \\beta (b a_B + \\lambda v_B) + 2 c \\beta r_B$$\nFinally, isolating $x^{\\ast}$ yields the closed-form expression for the Bayes-optimal allocation:\n$$x^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha(b a_A + \\lambda v_A) - \\beta(b a_B + \\lambda v_B) + 2 c \\beta r_B}{2 c (\\alpha r_A + \\beta r_B)}$$\nThis expression represents the optimal fraction of the phage dose to be allocated to phage $P_A$ to maximize the expected therapeutic utility, given the prior beliefs about the bacterial population structure.",
