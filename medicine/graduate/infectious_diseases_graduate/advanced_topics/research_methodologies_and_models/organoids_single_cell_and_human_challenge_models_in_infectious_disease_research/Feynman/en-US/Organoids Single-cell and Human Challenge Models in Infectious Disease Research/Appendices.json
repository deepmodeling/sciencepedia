            "problem": "A human airway organoid culture is used to study apical entry of a respiratory pathogen that binds a cell-surface receptor. Single-cell quantification indicates that each epithelial cell has $N_{R}$ apical receptors. The ligand-receptor interaction at the apical membrane is modeled as a reversible binding reaction $L + R \\rightleftharpoons LR$ governed by the law of mass action, with forward rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and reverse rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$. The dissociation constant is defined as $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$. Assume that binding equilibrates rapidly relative to downstream internalization such that the system reaches a quasi-steady state for binding at the apical surface.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and receptor pharmacology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, the derivation of the steady-state receptor occupancy fraction, $\\theta$. Second, the calculation of the fold-change in pathogen entry flux, $F$, between two conditions.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Receptor Occupancy $\\theta$\n\nThe ligand-receptor binding is described by the reversible reaction:\n$$L + R \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} LR$$\nHere, $L$ represents the free ligand, $R$ the free receptor, and $LR$ the ligand-receptor complex. The forward and reverse rate constants are $k_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off}}$, respectively.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of formation of the complex is proportional to the concentrations of the free reactants, $[L]$ and $[R]$:\n$$\\text{Rate}_{\\mathrm{forward}} = k_{\\mathrm{on}} [L] [R]$$\nThe rate of dissociation of the complex is proportional to the concentration of the complex, $[LR]$:\n$$\\text{Rate}_{\\mathrm{reverse}} = k_{\\mathrm{off}} [LR]$$\nThe problem states that binding equilibrates rapidly, implying the system reaches a quasi-steady state where the rate of formation equals the rate of dissociation:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{on}} [L] [R] = k_{\\mathrm{off}} [LR]$$\nRearranging this equation, we can group the rate constants:\n$$\\frac{[L] [R]}{[LR]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nThe problem defines the dissociation constant, $K_{d}$, as $K_{d} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$. Substituting this definition gives the equilibrium relationship:\n$$K_{d} = \\frac{[L] [R]}{[LR]}$$\nThe receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of total receptors that are occupied by a ligand. Let $[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}$ be the total concentration of receptors. The total concentration is the sum of free receptors, $[R]$, and occupied receptors, $[LR]$:\n$$[R]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [R] + [LR]$$\nThe occupancy fraction is therefore:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{[R]_{\\mathrm{total}}} = \\frac{[LR]}{[R] + [LR]}$$\nTo express $\\theta$ in terms of $[L]$ and $K_{d}$, we first rearrange the equilibrium equation to solve for $[R]$:\n$$[R] = K_{d} \\frac{[LR]}{[L]}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $[R]$ into the denominator of the equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[LR]}{\\left(K_{d} \\frac{[LR]}{[L]}\\right) + [LR]}$$\nThe term $[LR]$ is common to all terms in the numerator and denominator and can be cancelled:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_{d}}{[L]} + 1}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $[L]$ yields the final expression, commonly known as the Hill-Langmuir equation for non-cooperative binding:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{[L]}{K_{d} + [L]}$$\nThis completes the derivation for Part 1.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Fold-Change in Entry Flux\n\nThe entry flux per cell, $J$, is given by the model $J = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} N_{R} \\theta$. We need to compute the fold-change $F = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{J_{\\mathrm{org}}}$, where the subscripts `org` and `HCM` denote the organoid and Human Challenge Model conditions, respectively.\n\nThe flux for the organoid model is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{org}} = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} N_{R} \\theta_{\\mathrm{org}}$$\nThe flux for the Human Challenge Model is:\n$$J_{\\mathrm{HCM}} = k_{\\mathrm{entry}} N_{R} \\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}$$\nThe problem states that $k_{\\mathrm{entry}}$ and $N_{R}$ are the same in both conditions. Therefore, the fold-change $F$ simplifies to the ratio of the occupancies:\n$$F = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{J_{\\mathrm{org}}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} N_{R} \\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{k_{\\mathrm{entry}} N_{R} \\theta_{\\mathrm{org}}} = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{org}}}$$\nUsing the result from Part 1, we can write the expressions for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{org}}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{org}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}$$\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}} = \\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{HCM}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}$$\nThe problem provides the relationships between the parameters in the two models:\n$$[L]_{\\mathrm{HCM}} = \\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}$$\n$$K_{d,\\mathrm{HCM}} = \\alpha K_{d,\\mathrm{org}}$$\nwhere $\\alpha = 0.40$ and $\\beta = 0.60$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}} = \\frac{\\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{\\alpha K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + \\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}$$\nNow we can write the full expression for $F$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\theta_{\\mathrm{HCM}}}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{org}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{\\alpha K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + \\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}}{\\frac{[L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}$$\nWe can simplify this complex fraction:\n$$F = \\frac{\\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{\\alpha K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + \\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}} \\times \\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{[L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}$$\nThe term $[L]_{\\mathrm{org}}$ cancels, yielding a general expression for the fold-change:\n$$F = \\beta \\left( \\frac{K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}}{\\alpha K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} + \\beta [L]_{\\mathrm{org}}} \\right)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $[L]_{\\mathrm{org}} = 5~\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_{d,\\mathrm{org}} = 15~\\mathrm{nM}$, $\\alpha = 0.40$, and $\\beta = 0.60$.

According to the problem statement, these observed counts are the superposition of two independent processes: true intracellular signal and ambient contamination. The expected value of a sum of independent Poisson variables is the sum of their individual expected values.\n\nThe total expected number of counts from the ambient pool is $\\rho n$. These are distributed according to the ambient probabilities $(p_{h}, p_{v})$. Therefore, the expected ambient counts for host and viral categories are:\n$$E[\\text{ambient}_{h}] = \\rho n p_{h}$$\n$$E[\\text{ambient}_{v}] = \\rho n p_{v}$$\n\nThe parameters $\\theta_{h}$ and $\\theta_{v}$ are defined as the expected true counts in an ideal, contamination-free experiment. The problem states that in the contaminated experiment, the expected contribution from true molecules is attenuated by a factor of $(1-\\rho)$. This implies that the expected true counts contributing to the observation are:\n$$E[\\text{true}_{h}] = (1-\\rho)\\theta_{h}$$\n$$E[\\text{true}_{v}] = (1-\\rho)\\theta_{v}$$\n\nBy the principle of superposition for Poisson processes, the rates for the observed counts are the sums of the rates of the contributing processes:\n$$\\lambda_{h} = E[o_{h}] = E[\\text{true}_{h}] + E[\\text{ambient}_{h}] = (1-\\rho)\\theta_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}$$\n$$\\lambda_{v} = E[o_{v}] = E[\\text{true}_{v}] + E[\\text{ambient}_{v}] = (1-\\rho)\\theta_{v} + \\rho n p_{v}$$\n\nThe observed counts $o_{h}$ and $o_{v}$ are modeled as independent samples from Poisson distributions with these rates:\n$$o_{h} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{h})$$\n$$o_{v} \\sim \\text{Pois}(\\lambda_{v})$$\n\nThe likelihood function $L$ for observing the data $(o_{h}, o_{v})$ given the parameters $(\\theta_{h}, \\theta_{v})$ is the product of the probabilities of observing each count, due to their independence:\n$$L(\\theta_{h}, \\theta_{v} | o_{h}, o_{v}) = P(o_{h}|\\lambda_{h}) \\cdot P(o_{v}|\\lambda_{v}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{h}^{o_{h}} \\exp(-\\lambda_{h})}{o_{h}!} \\cdot \\frac{\\lambda_{v}^{o_{v}} \\exp(-\\lambda_{v})}{o_{v}!}$$\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs), we maximize the log-likelihood function $\\ell = \\ln(L)$, as this simplifies the mathematics without changing the location of the maximum.\n$$\\ell(\\theta_{h}, \\theta_{v}) = o_{h}\\ln(\\lambda_{h}) - \\lambda_{h} + o_{v}\\ln(\\lambda_{v}) - \\lambda_{v} - \\ln(o_{h}!) - \\ln(o_{v}!)$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda_{h}$ and $\\lambda_{v}$:\n$$\\ell(\\theta_{h}, \\theta_{v}) = o_{h}\\ln((1-\\rho)\\theta_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}) - ((1-\\rho)\\theta_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}) + o_{v}\\ln((1-\\rho)\\theta_{v} + \\rho n p_{v}) - ((1-\\rho)\\theta_{v} + \\rho n p_{v}) - C$$\nwhere $C = \\ln(o_{h}!) + \\ln(o_{v}!)$ is a constant with respect to $\\theta_h$ and $\\theta_v$.\n\nTo find the MLEs $\\hat{\\theta}_{h}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{v}$, we take the partial derivatives of $\\ell$ with respect to $\\theta_{h}$ and $\\theta_{v}$ and set them to zero. The parameters $\\theta_h$ and $\\theta_v$ are uncoupled in the likelihood function, so we can solve for each one separately.\n\nFor $\\theta_{h}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\theta_{h}} = \\frac{o_{h} \\cdot (1-\\rho)}{(1-\\rho)\\theta_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}} - (1-\\rho)$$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the MLE $\\hat{\\theta}_{h}$:\n$$\\frac{o_{h} \\cdot (1-\\rho)}{(1-\\rho)\\hat{\\theta}_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}} - (1-\\rho) = 0$$\nSince $\\rho \\in [0, 1)$, we know $1-\\rho \\neq 0$, so we can divide by $(1-\\rho)$:\n$$\\frac{o_{h}}{(1-\\rho)\\hat{\\theta}_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}} = 1$$\n$$o_{h} = (1-\\rho)\\hat{\\theta}_{h} + \\rho n p_{h}$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\theta}_{h}$:\n$$(1-\\rho)\\hat{\\theta}_{h} = o_{h} - \\rho n p_{h}$$\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{h} = \\frac{o_{h} - \\rho n p_{h}}{1-\\rho}$$\n\nThe derivation for $\\hat{\\theta}_{v}$ is identical due to the symmetry of the problem:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\theta_{v}} = \\frac{o_{v} \\cdot (1-\\rho)}{(1-\\rho)\\theta_{v} + \\rho n p_{v}} - (1-\\rho) = 0$$\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{v} = \\frac{o_{v} - \\rho n p_{v}}{1-\\rho}$$\nThese are the closed-form maximum likelihood estimators for $(\\theta_h, \\theta_v)$. Since expected counts cannot be negative, the estimator is technically $\\hat{\\theta} = \\max(0, \\frac{o - \\rho n p}{1-\\rho})$. We will calculate the values and check for non-negativity.\n\n### Application to the Given Data\n\nWe are given the following values:\n$o_{h} = 780$, $o_{v} = 220$, $n = 1000$, $\\rho = 0.2$, $p_{h} = 0.9$, $p_{v} = 0.1$.\n\nFirst, calculate the estimated expected ambient contribution for each category:\nExpected ambient host counts: $\\rho n p_{h} = 0.2 \\times 1000 \\times 0.9 = 200 \\times 0.9 = 180$.\nExpected ambient viral counts: $\\rho n p_{v} = 0.2 \\times 1000 \\times 0.1 = 200 \\times 0.1 = 20$.\n\nNow, substitute these into the estimator formulas. The term $1-\\rho = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8$.\n\nFor the host counts, $\\hat{\\theta}_{h}$:\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{h} = \\frac{o_{h} - \\rho n p_{h}}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{780 - 180}{0.8} = \\frac{600}{0.8} = 750$$\nSince $750 > 0$, this value is valid.\n\nFor the viral counts, $\\hat{\\theta}_{v}$:\n$$\\hat{\\theta}_{v} = \\frac{o_{v} - \\rho n p_{v}}{1-\\rho} = \\frac{220 - 20}{0.8} = \\frac{200}{0.8} = 250$$\nSince $250 > 0$, this value is also valid.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate for the true intracellular expected counts is $(\\hat{\\theta}_{h}, \\hat{\\theta}_{v}) = (750, 250)$.

The time step is constant at $\\Delta t = 1$ day. The formula for the trapezoidal rule is:\n$$ AUC = \\Delta t \\left( \\frac{N(t_0) + N(t_{10})}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{9} N(t_i) \\right) $$\nFor the control arm, with $\\Delta t=1$, $N_c(0)=0$, and $N_c(10)=0$:\n$$ AUC_c = 1 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{0 + 0}{2} + \\sum_{i=1}^{9} N_c(i) \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} N_c(i) $$\n$$ AUC_c = N_c(1)+N_c(2)+N_c(3)+N_c(4)+N_c(5)+N_c(6)+N_c(7)+N_c(8)+N_c(9) $$\n$$ AUC_c = 10^{\\frac{6}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{12}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{18}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{20}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{16}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{10}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{6}{3.3}} + 10^{\\frac{3}{3.3}} + 0 $$\nNumerically, this is:\n$AUC_c \\approx 65.793 + 4328.741 + 284803.589 + 1149799.305 + 70543.604 + 1072.304 + 65.793 + 8.113 \\approx 1510687.24$ copies-day/mL.\n\nNext, we repeat the process for the treatment arm. The given $C_t$ values are $[40, 36, 32, 26, 24, 28, 34, 38, 40, 40, 40]$. The daily viral loads, $N_t(t)$, are:\n- $t=0, C_t=40 > 38 \\implies N_t(0) = 0$\n- $t=1, C_t=36 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(1) = 10^{\\frac{40-36}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{4}{3.3}}$\n- $t=2, C_t=32 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(2) = 10^{\\frac{40-32}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{8}{3.3}}$\n- $t=3, C_t=26 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(3) = 10^{\\frac{40-26}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{14}{3.3}}$\n- $t=4, C_t=24 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(4) = 10^{\\frac{40-24}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{16}{3.3}}$\n- $t=5, C_t=28 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(5) = 10^{\\frac{40-28}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{12}{3.3}}$\n- $t=6, C_t=34 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(6) = 10^{\\frac{40-34}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{6}{3.3}}$\n- $t=7, C_t=38 \\le 38 \\implies N_t(7) = 10^{\\frac{40-38}{3.3}} = 10^{\\frac{2}{3.3}}$\n- $t=8, C_t=40 > 38 \\implies N_t(8) = 0$\n- $t=9, C_t=40 > 38 \\implies N_t(9) = 0$\n- $t=10, C_t=40 > 38 \\implies N_t(10) = 0$\n\nWe apply the trapezoidal rule for the treatment arm, $AUC_t$.
