            "introduction": "Clinical diagnosis is fundamentally an exercise in probabilistic reasoning. We start with an initial suspicion—a pretest probability—based on a patient's presentation, and we update this probability as new data, such as physical examination findings or lab results, become available. This practice  provides a quantitative framework for this process using Bayes' theorem, demonstrating how the presence of a specific sign like a petechial rash can dramatically alter the likelihood of invasive meningococcal disease.",

            "problem": "A clinician in an emergency department evaluates an adult with suspected acute bacterial meningitis affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The primary diagnostic concern is invasive meningococcal disease causing meningitis due to Neisseria meningitidis. In this clinical population of patients with suspected bacterial meningitis before any physical examination findings, the pretest probability of invasive meningococcal disease is $0.10$. Consider the presence of a petechial rash on physical examination as a binary index test for invasive meningococcal disease in this context. Empirically, the sensitivity of the petechial rash for invasive meningococcal disease is $0.70$, and the specificity is $0.90$.\n\nUsing Bayes’ theorem and the standard definitions of sensitivity and specificity, compute the post-test probability of invasive meningococcal disease given that the petechial rash is present. Express your answer as a decimal without a percent sign and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "We need to compute the post-test probability of invasive meningococcal disease given a positive test (presence of a petechial rash), denoted as $P(D|T)$. We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nThe given information is:\n- Pretest probability of disease, $P(D) = 0.10$.\n- Sensitivity of the test, $P(T|D) = 0.70$.\n- Specificity of the test, $P(T^c|D^c) = 0.90$, where $D^c$ is the absence of disease and $T^c$ is the absence of the rash.\n\nBayes' theorem is:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, using the law of total probability:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D) P(D) + P(T|D^c) P(D^c) $$\n\nWe need to find the values for $P(D^c)$ and $P(T|D^c)$.\n1.  The probability of not having the disease is the complement of having it:\n    $$ P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\n2.  The probability of a positive test in a healthy person, $P(T|D^c)$, is 1 minus the specificity:\n    $$ P(T|D^c) = 1 - P(T^c|D^c) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 $$\n\nNow we can calculate $P(T)$:\n$$ P(T) = (0.70)(0.10) + (0.10)(0.90) = 0.07 + 0.09 = 0.16 $$\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into Bayes' theorem:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{(0.70)(0.10)}{0.16} = \\frac{0.07}{0.16} = 0.4375 $$\nThe result $0.4375$ has four significant figures, as requested.",

            "introduction": "Successfully treating a central nervous system infection requires not only selecting an active antimicrobial agent but also ensuring it can penetrate the blood-CSF barrier to reach therapeutic concentrations at the site of infection. This pharmacokinetic challenge is a core principle of neuro-infectious disease management. This exercise  delves into the critical factors—serum concentration, protein binding, and penetration ratios—that determine drug levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, using the example of vancomycin in bacterial meningitis.",

In plasma, the protein binding of vancomycin is $0.50$, and only the unbound fraction partitions across the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. In the setting of inflamed meninges, the cerebrospinal fluid to serum unbound concentration ratio is observed to be $0.30$. Assume that protein binding in cerebrospinal fluid is negligible, so that the total cerebrospinal fluid concentration approximates the unbound cerebrospinal fluid concentration at trough.\n\nUsing only the following foundational pharmacokinetic facts: (i) only unbound drug crosses biological barriers, (ii) the unbound fraction in plasma is $1$ minus the bound fraction, and (iii) the cerebrospinal fluid to serum ratio specified applies to unbound concentrations at steady state, compute the expected vancomycin trough total cerebrospinal fluid concentration.

            "introduction": "Evidence-based medicine relies on our ability to interpret data from clinical trials and apply it to patient care. While metrics like relative risk are common, the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and its reciprocal, the number needed to treat (NNT), offer a more intuitive understanding of an intervention's real-world impact. This practice  walks through the calculation of ARR and NNT, using hypothetical data from a trial of adjunctive dexamethasone in bacterial meningitis to illustrate how we quantify the clinical benefit of a therapy.",

Using the foundational definition of risk as probability of an event, compute for each endpoint the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat (NNT), where number needed to treat (NNT) is defined as the number of patients who must receive the intervention to prevent one additional event compared with control.
