            "introduction": "A fundamental task in public health surveillance is to translate risk probabilities into concrete estimates of disease burden within a population. This exercise  challenges you to apply the chain rule of probability to a sequence of dependent events — maternal infection, vertical transmission, and the development of symptomatic disease. By connecting this multi-step probability to the concept of expected value, you will build foundational skills in quantitative epidemiology and learn to predict the tangible impact of an infectious outbreak from core transmission parameters.",

            "problem": "A metropolitan birth cohort surveillance system monitors congenital infections within the category Toxoplasma, Others, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus (TORCH). During a defined outbreak period dominated by primary maternal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, epidemiologists estimate three parameters aggregated over the full gestational window: the probability of maternal infection during pregnancy is $0.05$, the conditional probability of vertical transmission given maternal infection is $0.4$, and the conditional probability that a vertically infected neonate is symptomatic at birth is $0.1$. Over the same period, there are $20{,}000$ completed pregnancies in the region.\n\nStarting only from fundamental definitions in probability (events, conditional probability, the chain rule for probabilities, indicator random variables, and linearity of expectation), and assuming that the reported risks are stable across gestations and apply identically and independently to each pregnancy at the population level, derive an expression for the expected number of neonates born with symptomatic congenital CMV in this cohort and compute its value. Express your final answer as a single real number representing the count of affected neonates. Do not use a percentage sign. No rounding is required if the exact value is obtained.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in epidemiology and probability theory, well-posed with a unique and stable solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. The data provided are self-contained and consistent, and the required derivation is based on fundamental mathematical principles. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the expected number of neonates born with symptomatic congenital Cytomegalovirus (CMV) in a cohort of $N$ pregnancies. The problem requires the derivation to start from fundamental definitions.\n\nLet $N = 20{,}000$ be the total number of completed pregnancies in the cohort. The problem assumes that the outcomes of the pregnancies are independent and identically distributed events.\n\nFor a single pregnancy, we define the following sequence of events:\n1.  Let $M$ be the event that the mother acquires a primary CMV infection during pregnancy.\n2.  Let $T$ be the event that vertical transmission of the virus from mother to fetus occurs.\n3.  Let $S$ be the event that the neonate is born with symptomatic congenital CMV.\n\nThe problem provides the following probabilities:\n- The probability of maternal infection: $P(M) = 0.05$.\n- The conditional probability of vertical transmission, given maternal infection: $P(T|M) = 0.4$.\n- The conditional probability that a vertically infected neonate is symptomatic at birth. A \"vertically infected neonate\" is one for whom event $T$ has occurred. Thus, this is the conditional probability of $S$ given $T$: $P(S|T) = 0.1$.\n\nFor a neonate to be born with symptomatic congenital CMV (event $S$), vertical transmission must have occurred (event $T$), which in turn requires that the mother was infected during pregnancy (event $M$). This establishes a logical chain of necessary conditions: $S \\implies T \\implies M$. In the language of set theory, this means the event sets are nested: $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq M$.\n\nOur first goal is to calculate the probability, $p_{\\text{symptomatic}}$, that a single randomly selected neonate from this cohort is born with symptomatic congenital CMV. This is the probability of event $S$, i.e., $p_{\\text{symptomatic}} = P(S)$.\n\nWe use the chain rule for probabilities, which is derived from the fundamental definition of conditional probability, $P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$.\nThe joint probability of the three events is $P(S \\cap T \\cap M)$. Because $S \\subseteq T \\subseteq M$, the intersection of these three events is simply the most specific event, $S$. Therefore, $P(S \\cap T \\cap M) = P(S)$.\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can express this joint probability as:\n$$P(S \\cap T \\cap M) = P(S | T \\cap M) P(T | M) P(M)$$\nSince $T \\subseteq M$, the intersection $T \\cap M$ is identical to the event $T$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$P(S) = P(S | T) P(T | M) P(M)$$\nThis expression gives the overall probability of a neonate being born with symptomatic congenital CMV. We can now substitute the given values:\n$$p_{\\text{symptomatic}} = P(S) = (0.1) \\times (0.4) \\times (0.05)$$\n$$p_{\\text{symptomatic}} = 0.04 \\times 0.05 = 0.002$$\nSo, the probability for any single neonate to be symptomatic is $0.002$.\n\nNext, we find the expected total number of symptomatic neonates in the cohort of $N = 20{,}000$ pregnancies. Let $X$ be the random variable representing this total count. To do this, as per the problem instructions, we define an indicator random variable for each pregnancy.\n\nFor each pregnancy $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$, let $X_i$ be an indicator variable such that:\n$$\nX_i =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if the } i\\text{-th neonate is born with symptomatic congenital CMV} \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of symptomatic neonates, $X$, is the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$X = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nTo find the expected number, we compute the expectation of $X$, $E[X]$. By the linearity of expectation, the expectation of a sum of random variables is the sum of their individual expectations:\n$$E[X] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} E[X_i]$$\nThe expectation of an indicator variable $X_i$ is, by definition, the probability of the event it indicates:\n$$E[X_i] = (1 \\times P(X_i=1)) + (0 \\times P(X_i=0)) = P(X_i=1)$$\nThe event $X_i=1$ is that the $i$-th neonate is symptomatic. Since the risks are assumed to be identical for all pregnancies, this probability is the same for all $i$ and is equal to the value we calculated earlier:\n$$P(X_i=1) = p_{\\text{symptomatic}} = 0.002$$\nTherefore, $E[X_i] = 0.002$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the sum for $E[X]$:\n$$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} p_{\\text{symptomatic}} = N \\times p_{\\text{symptomatic}}$$\nFinally, we compute the numerical value:\n$$E[X] = 20{,}000 \\times 0.002$$\n$$E[X] = 20{,}000 \\times \\frac{2}{1000} = 20 \\times 2 = 40$$\nThus, the expected number of neonates born with symptomatic congenital CMV in this cohort is $40$.",

            "problem": "A central goal in preventing neonatal infections within the Toxoplasma gondii, Other agents, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus (TORCH) framework is to reduce intrapartum transmission risk by combining interventions that target distinct biological pathways. Consider herpes simplex virus in a woman who presents in labor with active genital lesions. The baseline intrapartum transmission probability (without any interventions) is $0.3$. Two interventions are considered:\n\n- Suppressive acyclovir initiated at $36$ weeks’ gestation, which in women who nonetheless have active lesions at delivery reduces intrapartum transmission via lowering maternal viral replication, with an effectiveness (defined as relative risk reduction) of $0.5$.\n- Elective cesarean section performed for active lesions, which reduces intrapartum transmission by limiting neonatal exposure to infected genital secretions, with an effectiveness (defined as relative risk reduction) of $0.85$.\n\nAssume the two interventions act through independent mechanisms so that their effects on risk combine multiplicatively on the risk scale. Starting from the definitions of risk and relative risk reduction and the independence assumption, derive the overall absolute reduction in intrapartum transmission probability achieved when both interventions are applied in this population.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the overall absolute reduction in intrapartum transmission probability when two interventions, suppressive acyclovir and elective cesarean section, are combined.\n\nLet $P_0$ be the baseline transmission probability, given as $P_0 = 0.3$.\nLet $E_A$ and $E_C$ be the effectiveness of acyclovir and cesarean section, respectively. The problem states these are defined as relative risk reduction (RRR).\nWe are given $E_A = 0.5$ and $E_C = 0.85$.\n\nThe relative risk (RR) of an event under a given intervention is the ratio of the probability of the event occurring with the intervention to the probability of it occurring without the intervention (baseline). The effectiveness, or RRR, is related to the relative risk by the formula:\n$$E = \\text{RRR} = 1 - \\text{RR}$$\nFrom this, the relative risk can be expressed as:\n$$\\text{RR} = 1 - E$$\n\nLet $RR_A$ be the relative risk for a patient receiving acyclovir, and $RR_C$ be the relative risk for a patient undergoing a cesarean section. Using the given effectiveness values, we can calculate these relative risks:\n$$RR_A = 1 - E_A = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5$$\n$$RR_C = 1 - E_C = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$$\n\nThe problem states that the two interventions act through independent mechanisms, and their effects on risk combine multiplicatively on the risk scale.

            "problem": "Antenatal diagnosis of congenital infection from the Toxoplasmosis, Other (including syphilis), Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex virus (TORCH) group hinges on correctly interpreting serologic tests in the context of low pretest probability. Consider a vaccinated pregnant population in which the point prevalence of acute rubella infection at presentation is $p = 8 \\times 10^{-4}$. A standard enzyme immunoassay for rubella Immunoglobulin M (IgM) has sensitivity $\\text{Se} = 0.92$ and specificity $\\text{Sp} = 0.985$.

            "solution": "The objective is to calculate the posterior probability that a person does not have acute rubella infection given that their test result is positive, denoted as $P(R^c|T^+)$. We will use Bayes' theorem.\n\nFirst, let's define the events:\n- $R$: The event of acute rubella infection.\n- $R^c$: The event of no acute rubella infection.\n- $T^+$: The event of a positive rubella IgM test.\n- $V$: The event of concurrent acute parvovirus B19 infection.\n\nFrom the problem, we have the following probabilities:\n- Prevalence of rubella: $P(R) = p = 8 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.0008$.\n- Prevalence of no rubella: $P(R^c) = 1 - p = 0.9992$.\n- Prevalence of parvovirus B19: $P(V) = q = 0.015$.\n- Test sensitivity: $P(T^+|R) = \\text{Se} = 0.92$.\n- Test specificity (baseline): $P(T^-|R^c \\text{ and } V^c) = \\text{Sp} = 0.985$.

A false positive can occur in individuals with or without parvovirus B19. We use the law of total probability, conditioning on $V$:\n$$P(T^+|R^c) = P(T^+|R^c \\cap V)P(V|R^c) + P(T^+|R^c \\cap V^c)P(V^c|R^c)$$\nAssuming rubella and parvovirus infections are independent events, $P(V|R^c) = P(V) = q$ and $P(V^c|R^c) = P(V^c) = 1-q$.\n\n1.

In individuals without rubella but with parvovirus ($R^c \\cap V$), a positive test can result from two independent mechanisms: the baseline false positivity and the parvovirus cross-reactivity. The probability of at least one of these occurring is $1 - P(\\text{neither occurs})$.\n    $$P(T^+|R^c \\cap V) = 1 - (1 - (1-\\text{Sp}))(1 - r) = 1 - (\\text{Sp})(1 - r)$$\n    $$P(T^+|R^c \\cap V) = 1 - (0.985)(1 - 0.10) = 1 - (0.985)(0.9) = 1 - 0.8865 = 0.1135$$\n\nNow, we can compute the overall false positive rate $P(T^+|R^c)$:\n$$P(T^+|R^c) = (0.1135)(0.015) + (0.015)(1 - 0.015)$$\n$$P(T^+|R^c) = 0.0017025 + (0.015)(0.985) = 0.0017025 + 0.014775 = 0.0164775$$\n\nNow we calculate the terms for Bayes' theorem:\n- Probability of a true positive result in the population:\n  $$P(T^+ \\cap R) = P(T^+|R)P(R) = (0.92)(0.0008) = 0.000736$$\n- Probability of a false positive result in the population:\n  $$P(T^+ \\cap R^c) = P(T^+|R^c)P(R^c) = (0.0164775)(0.9992) = 0.0164643192$$\n\nThe total probability of a positive test is the sum:\n$$P(T^+) = P(T^+ \\cap R) + P(T^+ \\cap R^c) = 0.000736 + 0.0164643192 = 0.0172003192$$\n\nFinally, we compute the posterior probability of no rubella given a positive test:\n$$P(R^c|T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ \\cap R^c)}{P(T^+)} = \\frac{0.0164643192}{0.0172003192} \\approx 0.9572099$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, the final answer is $0.9572$.",
