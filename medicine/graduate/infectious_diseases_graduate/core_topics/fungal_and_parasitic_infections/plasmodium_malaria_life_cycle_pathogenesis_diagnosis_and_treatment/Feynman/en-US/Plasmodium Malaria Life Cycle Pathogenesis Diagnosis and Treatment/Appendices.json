This exercise delves into the standard World Health Organization (WHO) method for determining parasitemia from a thick blood smear, a technique that relies on the patient's own white blood cell count as an internal calibrator . By working through this calculation, you will master the proportional reasoning that translates microscopic counts into a clinically vital metric: parasites per microliter of blood.",

            "problem": "Malaria parasite quantification by thick blood smear relies on the principle that, within a sampled area of the smear, the count of a species is proportional to its concentration in the original blood, and that Red Blood Cells (RBCs) are lysed in thick films so parasites cannot be related to RBC counts. Instead, White Blood Cell (WBC) counts serve as an internal calibrator because WBCs remain intact and their absolute concentration in whole blood is measurable independently. A laboratory technologist examines a thick blood smear and observes $60$ asexual malaria parasites while counting $200$ White Blood Cells (WBC) across the same examined area. The patient’s absolute WBC count from a complete blood count is $8{,}000$ WBC per $\\mu$L. Using first principles of proportional sampling and concentrations, derive an expression for the parasite concentration per $\\mu$L in the original blood and compute its value. Then, based on well-established clinical reasoning that severe malaria generally correlates with very high parasite burdens in blood, qualitatively interpret whether the computed density alone would suggest severe or uncomplicated malaria in the absence of other severity criteria. Express your final numeric result as parasites per $\\mu$L; provide only the single numerical value as your final answer. No rounding is required if the value is exact.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and computation of malaria parasite concentration in whole blood, based on counts from a thick blood smear and an absolute white blood cell (WBC) count. It also asks for a qualitative clinical interpretation of the resulting parasite density.\n\nThe core principle is proportionality. The ratio of the number of parasites to the number of WBCs counted in a representative area of the thick smear is assumed to be equal to the ratio of their respective concentrations in the original whole blood sample.\n\nLet us define the following variables:\n- $N_p$: the number of parasites counted in the thick smear.\n- $N_{WBC}$: the number of WBCs counted in the same area of the smear.\n- $C_p$: the concentration of parasites in the blood, in units of parasites per microliter ($\\text{parasites}/\\mu\\text{L}$). This is the quantity to be determined.\n- $C_{WBC}$: the absolute concentration of WBCs in the blood, in units of WBCs per microliter ($\\text{WBCs}/\\mu\\text{L}$).\n\nBased on the principle of proportional sampling, we can set up the following relationship:\n$$\n\\frac{N_p}{N_{WBC}} = \\frac{C_p}{C_{WBC}}\n$$\n\nThis equation states that the ratio of counts in the smear is a direct reflection of the ratio of concentrations in the blood volume from which the smear was made.\n\nTo find the parasite concentration, $C_p$, we rearrange this expression:\n$$\nC_p = \\frac{N_p}{N_{WBC}} \\times C_{WBC}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this derived formula:\n- $N_p = 60$\n- $N_{WBC} = 200$\n- $C_{WBC} = 8000 \\, \\text{WBCs}/\\mu\\text{L}$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$\nC_p = \\frac{60}{200} \\times 8000 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the ratio of parasites to WBCs in the smear:\n$$\n\\frac{60}{200} = \\frac{6}{20} = \\frac{3}{10} = 0.3\n$$\nNext, we multiply this dimensionless ratio by the absolute WBC concentration:\n$$\nC_p = 0.3 \\times 8000 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}} = 2400 \\, \\frac{\\text{parasites}}{\\mu\\text{L}}\n$$\nThus, the calculated parasite concentration is $2400$ parasites per microliter of blood.\n\nFor the qualitative interpretation, we compare this value to established clinical thresholds for malaria severity. Severe malaria, particularly due to *Plasmodium falciparum*, is often associated with hyperparasitemia. While the exact threshold can vary by region and patient immunity, hyperparasitemia is frequently defined as a parasite density exceeding $100,000$ or even $250,000$ parasites/$\\mu$L. A density of $2400$ parasites/$\\mu$L is considered a low to moderate parasite burden. In the absence of other specific signs of severity (e.g., impaired consciousness, respiratory distress, severe anemia, organ dysfunction), this parasite density by itself would suggest **uncomplicated malaria**.",

            "solution": "This problem involves analyzing a discrete-time model of parasite dynamics to determine the condition for clearance and to estimate a drug's efficacy from clinical data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Clearance Condition**\n\nThe dynamics of the total parasitemia $N_t$ under drug treatment are described by the linear difference equation:\n$$N_{t+1} = r(1-k)N_t$$\nLet the net per-cycle multiplication factor be $\\lambda = r(1-k)$.
