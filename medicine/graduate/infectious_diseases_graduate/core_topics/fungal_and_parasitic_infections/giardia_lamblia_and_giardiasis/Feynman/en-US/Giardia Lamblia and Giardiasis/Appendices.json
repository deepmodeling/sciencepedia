It is scientifically sound, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nThe inactivation of *Giardia lamblia* cysts is described by the first-order differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = -k(T) C N\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the concentration of viable cysts, $t$ is time, $C$ is the constant chlorine concentration, and $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent rate constant. To find the relationship between the initial cyst concentration, $N(0)$, and the concentration at a later time, $N(t)$, we must solve this differential equation. We can separate the variables:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{N} = -k(T) C \\, dt\n$$\nNext, we integrate both sides. The concentration of cysts changes from $N(0)$ at $t=0$ to $N(t)$ at time $t$. Since $k(T)$ and $C$ are constant with respect to time, the integration is as follows:\n$$\n\\int_{N(0)}^{N(t)} \\frac{1}{N} dN = \\int_{0}^{t} -k(T) C \\, dt\n$$\n$$\n[\\ln(N)]_{N(0)}^{N(t)} = -k(T) C [t]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(N(t)) - \\ln(N(0)) = -k(T) C t\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we get:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -k(T) C t\n$$\nThe problem defines the concentration-time product as $Ct = C \\cdot t$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N(t)}{N(0)}\\right) = -k(T) (Ct)\n$$\nThe problem also specifies an $L$ $\\log_{10}$ reduction, defined by the relation $N(t)/N(0) = 10^{-L}$. We can substitute this into our integrated rate law:\n$$\n\\ln(10^{-L}) = -k(T) (Ct)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(a^b) = b \\ln(a)$, we have:\n$$\n-L \\ln(10) = -k(T) (Ct)\n$$\nThe negative signs on both sides cancel, yielding:\n$$\nL \\ln(10) = k(T) (Ct)\n$$\nSolving for the required Ct product gives the general expression:\n$$\nCt = \\frac{L \\ln(10)}{k(T)}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the Ct requirement. Now, we must evaluate this expression for the given conditions. First, we calculate the specific inactivation coefficient, $k(T)$, at the target temperature of $T=278.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ using the provided Arrhenius equation and parameters:\n$$\nk(T) = k_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\exp\\!\\left[-\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$k_{\\mathrm{ref}}=1.7\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$\n$E_{a}=4.0\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n$R=8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T=278.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{ref}}=293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe first evaluate the term in the exponent:\n$$\n-\\frac{E_{a}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) = -\\frac{4.0\\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}}{8.314\\ \\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{1}{278.15\\ \\mathrm{K}}-\\frac{1}{293.15\\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\approx -4811.16\\ \\mathrm{K} \\cdot (0.00359536\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1} - 0.00341122\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\approx -4811.16\\ \\mathrm{K} \\cdot (0.00018414\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\approx -0.88591\n$$\nNow, we can calculate $k(T)$:\n$$\nk(278.15\\ \\mathrm{K}) = (1.7\\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}) \\exp(-0.88591)\n$$\n$$\nk(278.15\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx (1.7\\times 10^{-4})(0.41233) \\approx 7.0096 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the Ct value required for a $L=3$ log reduction:\n$$\nCt = \\frac{3 \\ln(10)}{k(278.15\\ \\mathrm{K})}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\ln(10) \\approx 2.302585$:\n$$\nCt = \\frac{3 \\times 2.302585}{7.0096 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{mg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nCt \\approx \\frac{6.907755}{7.0096 \\times 10^{-5}}\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nCt \\approx 98547\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nCt \\approx 9.85 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{mg}\\cdot\\mathrm{min}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}\n$$",

In the language of survival analysis, this is the value of the survival function $S(t)$ at $t=\\tau_c$. The survival function $S(t)$ gives the probability that the event of interest (in this case, clearance of the infection) has not occurred by time $t$.\n\nLet $T$ be the random variable representing the time-to-clearance of the infection. The problem asks for the probability $P(T > \\tau_c)$. By definition, this is $S(\\tau_c)$.\n\nThe clearance of the infection is driven by two independent, competing processes:\n1.  Baseline non-immune elimination, with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda$.\n2.  Impaired immune-mediated elimination, with a constant hazard rate $\\lambda'$.\n\nLet $h_1(t)$ be the hazard function for the first process and $h_2(t)$ be the hazard function for the second process. The problem states these are constant:\n$h_1(t) = \\lambda$\n$h_2(t) = \\lambda'$\n\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is related to the hazard function $h(t)$ by the fundamental equation:\n$$S(t) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} h(u) \\,du \\right)$$\n\nFor the two competing processes, we can analyze this in two equivalent ways.\n\n**Method 1: Combining Survival Functions**\nLet $S_1(t)$ be the survival function for the first process alone, representing the probability that clearance has *not* occurred via the baseline mechanism by time $t$. Using the formula above:\n$$S_1(t) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} h_1(u) \\,du \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda \\,du \\right) = \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThis corresponds to the survival function of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$.\n\nSimilarly, let $S_2(t)$ be the survival function for the second process alone:\n$$S_2(t) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} h_2(u) \\,du \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} \\lambda' \\,du \\right) = \\exp(-\\lambda' t)$$\n\nThe overall survival from the infection, $S(t)$, is the probability that clearance has not occurred by *either* mechanism by time $t$. Since the two processes are independent, the probability of surviving both simultaneously is the product of their individual survival probabilities:\n$$S(t) = S_1(t) \\times S_2(t)$$\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t) \\times \\exp(-\\lambda' t) = \\exp(-\\lambda t - \\lambda' t)$$\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-(\\lambda + \\lambda') t)$$\n\n**Method 2: Combining Hazard Functions**\nA core principle of independent competing risks is that the overall hazard of the event (clearance) is the sum of the individual hazards of the competing processes. Let $h(t)$ be the overall hazard function for clearance.\n$$h(t) = h_1(t) + h_2(t) = \\lambda + \\lambda'$$\nThe overall hazard rate is constant because the individual rates are constant.\n\nNow, we can find the overall survival function $S(t)$ using this combined hazard rate:\n$$S(t) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} h(u) \\,du \\right) = \\exp\\left( -\\int_{0}^{t} (\\lambda + \\lambda') \\,du \\right)$$\n$$S(t) = \\exp\\left( -(\\lambda + \\lambda') \\int_{0}^{t} 1 \\,du \\right) = \\exp(-(\\lambda + \\lambda') t)$$\nBoth methods yield the same overall survival function, confirming the consistency of the approach.\n\nThe problem asks for the probability that the infection persists beyond the clinical threshold time $\\tau_c$. This is simply $S(t)$ evaluated at $t = \\tau_c$.\n$$P(\\text{infection persists beyond } \\tau_c) = S(\\tau_c) = \\exp(-(\\lambda + \\lambda') \\tau_c)$$\n\nThis expression is a dimensionless probability, as the units of $\\lambda$ and $\\lambda'$ are inverse time (e.g., $day^{-1}$) and the unit of $\\tau_c$ is time (e.g., $days$), making the exponent $(\\lambda + \\lambda')\\tau_c$ a dimensionless quantity.\nThe final expression is the derived probability.",
