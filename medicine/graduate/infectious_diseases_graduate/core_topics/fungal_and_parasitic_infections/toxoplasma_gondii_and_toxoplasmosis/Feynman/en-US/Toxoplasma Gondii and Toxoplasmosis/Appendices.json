The single-hit model, which leads to the exponential dose-response function, is a fundamental and widely used model for pathogen infectivity. It is scientifically sound.\n    -   **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($D$, $r$), a clear distributional assumption (Poisson), and a precise definition of the event of interest (infection). This allows for the derivation of a unique, meaningful solution.\n    -   **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, formal language, free of bias or subjective claims.\n\n3.  **Verdict**: The problem is valid. It is a standard application of probability theory to infectious disease modeling.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nLet $X$ be the random variable representing the number of initiating events that occur within the host following the exposure. According to the problem statement, $X$ follows a Poisson distribution, which we can write as $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean number of initiating events.\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ is given by:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that the mean number of initiating events, $\\lambda$, is proportional to the ingested dose $D$ via the per-oocyst initiating rate parameter $r$. Therefore, the mean of the distribution is:\n$$\\lambda = rD$$\n\nSubstituting this into the PMF, we get:\n$$P(X=k) = \\frac{(rD)^k \\exp(-rD)}{k!}$$\n\nInfection is defined as the occurrence of at least one initiating event. This corresponds to the event $X \\ge 1$. The probability of infection, denoted as $P_{\\text{inf}}$, is therefore $P(X \\ge 1)$. It is more straightforward to calculate this probability by considering the complement event, which is the occurrence of zero initiating events, $X=0$.\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} = P(X \\ge 1) = 1 - P(X < 1) = 1 - P(X=0)$$\nThe equality $P(X < 1) = P(X = 0)$ holds because the number of events $X$ must be a non-negative integer.\n\nWe calculate $P(X=0)$ by setting $k=0$ in the PMF:\n$$P(X=0) = \\frac{(rD)^0 \\exp(-rD)}{0!}$$\nBy definition, any non-zero number raised to the power of $0$ is $1$, and factorial of $0$ is $1$ (i.e., $(rD)^0=1$ for $rD \\neq 0$, and $0!=1$). Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$P(X=0) = \\exp(-rD)$$\n\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the infection probability, we obtain the general closed-form expression for the infection probability as a function of $r$ and $D$:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}}(r, D) = 1 - \\exp(-rD)$$\nThis is known as the exponential dose-response model.\n\nNow, we compute the specific infection probability for the given values:\n- Dose $D = 100$ oocysts\n- Rate parameter $r = 0.02$\n\nFirst, we calculate the mean number of initiating events, $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = rD = 0.02 \\times 100 = 2$$\n\nNext, we substitute this value into the probability formula:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} = 1 - \\exp(-2)$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we calculate $\\exp(-2)$:\n$$\\exp(-2) \\approx 0.13533528...$$\nThen, the probability of infection is:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} \\approx 1 - 0.13533528 = 0.86466472...$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$P_{\\text{inf}} \\approx 0.8647$$\n\n**Biological Interpretation**\n\nThe computed probability of approximately $0.8647$ signifies a high risk of infection. It implies that a single oral exposure to $100$ *Toxoplasma gondii* oocysts is expected to result in infection in approximately $86.5\\%$ of such cases, according to this model. This demonstrates that while the probability of any single oocyst initiating infection is low (given by $r=0.02$), the cumulative risk from a dose of $100$ oocysts becomes substantial. The non-linear nature of the dose-response relationship means that the probability of at least one success among many independent trials can be high, even if the individual success probability is small. This result underscores the high infectivity potential of *T. gondii* and the public health importance of avoiding exposure to contaminated materials.",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of food microbiology and thermal processing, well-posed with all necessary information, and free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\nThe thermal inactivation of microorganisms following first-order kinetics is described by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{N(t)}{N_0} = 10^{-t/D_T} $$\nwhere $N_0$ is the initial number of viable organisms, $N(t)$ is the number of viable organisms after a heating time $t$ at a constant temperature $T$, and $D_T$ is the decimal reduction time at that temperature. The decimal reduction time, or D-value, is the time required to reduce the microbial population by $90\\%$, which is equivalent to a $1$-log reduction.\n\nThe magnitude of the reduction is often expressed in logarithmic terms as $L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N(t)}\\right)$. Rearranging the first-order kinetic equation and taking the base-$10$ logarithm yields:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N(t)}\\right) = \\frac{t}{D_T} $$\nThus, the time $t$ required to achieve a specific log reduction $L$ is given by:\n$$ t = L \\times D_T $$\n\nThe problem provides the D-value at a reference temperature but requires the inactivation time at a different temperature. The relationship between the D-value and temperature is described by the $z$-value, which is the temperature change required to alter the D-value by a factor of $10$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{D_T}{D_{ref}}\\right) = \\frac{T_{ref} - T}{z} $$\nor, in exponential form:\n$$ D_T = D_{ref} \\cdot 10^{(T_{ref} - T)/z} $$\nwhere $D_T$ is the D-value at temperature $T$, $D_{ref}$ is the D-value at a reference temperature $T_{ref}$, and $z$ is the temperature sensitivity parameter.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n- Reference temperature, $T_{ref} = 60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- D-value at reference temperature, $D_{ref} = D_{60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = 2\\,\\mathrm{min}$\n- Temperature sensitivity parameter, $z = 7^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- Target cooking temperature, $T = 67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$\n- Desired log reduction, $L = 5$\n\nFirst, we must calculate the D-value at the target temperature of $67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which we denote as $D_{67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}}$. Using the z-value equation:\n$$ D_{67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = D_{60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot 10^{(60^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C})/7^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} $$\n$$ D_{67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = (2\\,\\mathrm{min}) \\cdot 10^{-7/7} $$\n$$ D_{67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = (2\\,\\mathrm{min}) \\cdot 10^{-1} $$\n$$ D_{67^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}} = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{min} $$\nThis result is consistent with the definition of the $z$-value: an increase in temperature of $7^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ (one $z$-value) causes the decimal reduction time to decrease by a factor of $10$.\n\nNext, we calculate the required holding time $t$ to achieve the desired $5$-log reduction at this new temperature.

We will proceed with a formal derivation and calculation.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that a patient has active toxoplasmosis (the disease), and $D^c$ be the event that the patient does not. Let $T+$ denote a positive PCR test result and $T-$ denote a negative result. The information provided can be formulated in probabilistic terms:\n\nThe pretest probability of disease is $\\pi = P(D) = 0.20$.\nThe probability of not having the disease is therefore $P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$.\nThe sensitivity of the test is $S_e = P(T+|D) = 0.90$.

This is the conditional probability of a negative test given that the disease is absent.\n\nWe are asked to derive expressions for the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and then to compute their values.\n\n**1. Derivation and Calculation of Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**\n\nThe PPV is the post-test probability of disease given a positive test result, defined as $P(D|T+)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:\n$$P(D|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D)P(D)}{P(T+)}$$\nThe term in the denominator, $P(T+)$, is the marginal probability of a positive test. We can expand this using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D)P(D) + P(T+|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nWe are given $P(T+|D) = S_e$ and $P(D) = \\pi$. The term $P(T+|D^c)$ is the probability of a positive test in a disease-free individual, which is the false positive rate. It is related to specificity by $P(T+|D^c) = 1 - P(T-|D^c) = 1 - S_p$. The term $P(D^c)$ is $1 - \\pi$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $P(T+)$:\n$$P(T+) = S_e \\cdot \\pi + (1-S_p) \\cdot (1-\\pi)$$\nNow, substituting this back into the expression for PPV, we obtain the general formula:\n$$PPV = P(D|T+) = \\frac{S_e \\cdot \\pi}{S_e \\cdot \\pi + (1-S_p) \\cdot (1-\\pi)}$$\nUsing the given numerical values: $\\pi=0.20$, $S_e=0.90$, and $S_p=0.95$.\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.90 \\times 0.20}{0.90 \\times 0.20 + (1-0.95) \\times (1-0.20)} = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.05 \\times 0.80}$$\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.18}{0.18 + 0.04} = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11}$$\nAs a decimal, $PPV \\approx 0.818181...$. The value rounded to four significant figures is $0.8182$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Calculation of Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**\n\nThe NPV is the post-test probability of not having the disease given a negative test result, defined as $P(D^c|T-)$. Using Bayes' theorem:\n$$P(D^c|T-) = \\frac{P(T-|D^c)P(D^c)}{P(T-)}$$\nThe denominator, $P(T-)$, is the marginal probability of a negative test, which is the complement of $P(T+)$, or can be expanded using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T-) = P(T-|D)P(D) + P(T-|D^c)P(D^c)$$\nThe term $P(T-|D)$ is the probability of a negative test in a diseased individual, which is the false negative rate. It is related to sensitivity by $P(T-|D) = 1 - P(T+|D) = 1 - S_e$. All other terms are defined as before.\n\nSubstituting into the expression for $P(T-)$:\n$$P(T-) = (1-S_e)\\cdot \\pi + S_p \\cdot (1-\\pi)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for NPV provides the general formula:\n$$NPV = P(D^c|T-) = \\frac{S_p \\cdot (1-\\pi)}{(1-S_e)\\cdot \\pi + S_p \\cdot (1-\\pi)}$$\nUsing the given numerical values:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.95 \\times (1-0.20)}{(1-0.90) \\times 0.20 + 0.95 \\times (1-0.20)} = \\frac{0.95 \\times 0.80}{0.10 \\times 0.20 + 0.95 \\times 0.80}$$\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.76}{0.02 + 0.76} = \\frac{0.76}{0.78} = \\frac{76}{78} = \\frac{38}{39}$$\nAs a decimal, $NPV \\approx 0.974358...$.\n\n**3. Application to Clinical Decision-Making**\n\nThe problem requires assessing the post-test probabilities of active infection against the provided action thresholds.\n- Treatment Threshold: $T_{treat} = 0.60$\n- No-Treatment Threshold: $T_{no-treat} = 0.05$\n\nThe pretest probability of infection is $P(D) = 0.20$, which lies between these two thresholds ($0.05 < 0.20 < 0.60$). This is the \"testing zone,\" where the state of diagnostic uncertainty justifies performing the test.\n\n**Case 1: Positive PCR Result**\nThe post-test probability of infection is the PPV.\n$$P(D|T+) = PPV \\approx 0.8182$$\nWe compare this to the treatment threshold: $0.8182 > 0.60$.\nSince the post-test probability exceeds the treatment threshold, a single positive PCR result is sufficient to recommend initiating anti-toxoplasma therapy.\n\n**Case 2: Negative PCR Result**\nThe post-test probability of infection is $P(D|T-)$. This is not the NPV; rather, it is $1 - NPV$.\n$$P(D|T-) = 1 - NPV = 1 - \\frac{38}{39} = \\frac{1}{39}$$\nAs a decimal, $P(D|T-) \\approx 0.02564...$\nWe compare this to the no-treatment threshold: $0.0256 < 0.05$.\nSince the post-test probability falls below the no-treatment threshold, a single negative PCR result is sufficient to confidently withhold therapy and rule out active infection for clinical decision-making purposes under this framework.\n\n**Conclusion on Confirmatory Testing**\nBoth a positive and a negative test result move the probability from the intermediate \"testing zone\" to a \"treatment zone\" (above $T_{treat}$) or a \"no-treatment zone\" (below $T_{no-treat}$). In this specific context, where decisions are strictly governed by these thresholds, the PCR assay is decisive. A single result is sufficient to guide the next clinical step, and therefore, confirmatory testing would not be necessary.",
