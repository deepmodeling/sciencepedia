            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and solvable.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Model**: Independent-hit framework for a single exposure event.\n-   **Distribution**: The number of successful initiation events follows a Poisson distribution.\n-   **Pathogen Parameter**: The intrinsic pathogen-specific parameter is $r = 0.09$. This represents the probability that a single oocyst successfully initiates infection.\n-   **Dose**: The ingested dose is $N = 10$ oocysts.\n-   **Population**: Immunocompetent, fully susceptible adults.\n-   **Condition**: Infection is assumed to result in illness (acute cryptosporidiosis).\n-   **Task 1**: Derive the infection probability for a single exposed person.\n-   **Task 2**: Determine the expected attack rate, defined as the expected proportion of the cohort that develops illness.\n-   **Output Requirement**: Express both answers as decimals rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Grounding**: The problem employs the exponential dose-response model, a standard and widely accepted component of Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). This model is a specific case of the independent-hit framework. The pathogen, *Cryptosporidium parvum*, is a well-documented waterborne parasite, and water contamination events are realistic scenarios. The given parameter $r=0.09$ and dose $N=10$ are within plausible ranges for this organism. The problem is scientifically grounded.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides a specific model, all necessary parameters ($r$ and $N$), and clear definitions for the quantities to be calculated (infection probability and expected attack rate). This structure allows for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The language is precise and quantitative, free of subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Consistency**: The premise that each of $N$ oocysts has an independent probability $r$ of causing infection leads to a total number of successes that can be modeled by a Binomial distribution, $\\text{Binomial}(N, r)$. The problem states that this number follows a Poisson distribution. For small $r$ and moderately large $N$, the Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda = Nr$ is an excellent approximation of the Binomial distribution. More directly, the statement can be interpreted as defining the specific model to be the exponential dose-response model, where the number of viable pathogens that reach a target site is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution with mean $Nr$. This is a standard formulation, and there is no contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in quantitative microbiology. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem statement specifies that the number of successful infection events, let this be the random variable $K$, follows a Poisson distribution. Let the mean of this distribution be $\\lambda$.\n$$K \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda)$$\nInfection occurs if there is at least one successful event, i.e., if $K \\geq 1$. The probability of infection, $P_{inf}$, is the complement of the probability of zero successful events ($K=0$).\nThe probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nFor $k=0$, the probability of no successful infection events is:\n$$P(K=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^0 \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nTherefore, the probability of infection is:\n$$P_{inf} = P(K \\geq 1) = 1 - P(K=0) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nThis is the standard form of the exponential dose-response model.\n\nThe next step is to determine the mean, $\\lambda$. The problem describes an independent-hit framework where the ingested dose is $N=10$ oocysts, and each oocyst has an independent probability $r=0.09$ of successfully initiating infection. The mean number of successful events $\\lambda$ is the product of the number of trials ($N$) and the probability of success per trial ($r$).\n$$\\lambda = N \\times r$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\lambda = 10 \\times 0.09 = 0.9$$\nNow, we can calculate the probability of infection for a single person.\n$$P_{inf} = 1 - \\exp(-0.9)$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$P_{inf} \\approx 1 - 0.40656966 = 0.59343034$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the infection probability is $0.5934$.\n\nThe second quantity to determine is the expected attack rate. The problem defines this as \"the expected proportion of a fully susceptible cohort that will develop acute cryptosporidiosis\". It is also given that infection results in illness. Therefore, the probability that any given individual in the susceptible cohort becomes ill, $p_{ill}$, is equal to the probability of infection, $P_{inf}$.\n$$p_{ill} = P_{inf}$$\nLet the size of the cohort be $M$. The number of ill individuals, $I$, can be modeled as a binomial random variable, $I \\sim \\text{Binomial}(M, p_{ill})$. The proportion of the cohort that becomes ill is the random variable $\\frac{I}{M}$. The expected attack rate is the expected value of this proportion.\n$$\\text{Expected Attack Rate} = E\\left[\\frac{I}{M}\\right] = \\frac{1}{M} E[I]$$\nThe expected value of a binomial random variable $I$ is $E[I] = M \\times p_{ill}$. Substituting this relationship:\n$$\\text{Expected Attack Rate} = \\frac{1}{M} (M \\times p_{ill}) = p_{ill}$$\nThus, the expected attack rate for the cohort is numerically equal to the individual probability of illness, which is equal to the probability of infection.\n$$\\text{Expected Attack Rate} = P_{inf} \\approx 0.5934$$\nBoth the infection probability and the expected attack rate, rounded to four significant figures, are $0.5934$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Rate Constant Expression**\n\nThe problem states that the inactivation process follows Chick–Watson kinetics with first-order dependence on both the free chlorine concentration, $C$, and the number of viable oocysts, $N$. The rate of change of viable oocysts with time, $t$, is therefore described by the following second-order rate law:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = -k C N $$\nwhere $k$ is the second-order rate constant.\n\nIn a typical disinfection scenario within a contact chamber, the disinfectant concentration $C$ is maintained at a constant value. We can therefore solve this differential equation by separation of variables.\n$$ \\frac{dN}{N} = -k C \\, dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial time $t=0$, where the number of oocysts is $N_0$, to a final time $t$, where the number of oocysts is $N_t$.\n$$ \\int_{N_0}^{N_t} \\frac{1}{N} \\, dN = \\int_0^t -k C \\, dt $$\nSince $k$ and $C$ are constant over the integration period, this yields:\n$$ [\\ln(N)]_{N_0}^{N_t} = -k C [t]_0^t $$\n$$ \\ln(N_t) - \\ln(N_0) = -k C t $$\nThis can be written in terms of the survival ratio, $\\frac{N_t}{N_0}$:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) = -k (Ct) $$\nThe problem requires the result in terms of base-$10$ log inactivation, denoted here as $L$. The base-$10$ log inactivation is defined as:\n$$ L = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_0}{N_t}\\right) = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) $$\nTo relate the natural logarithm to the base-$10$ logarithm, we use the change of base formula: $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$. Applying this to our integrated rate law:\n$$ \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{N_t}{N_0}\\right) = -k (Ct) $$\nSubstituting the definition of $L$:\n$$ \\ln(10) (-L) = -k (Ct) $$\n$$ L \\ln(10) = k (Ct) $$\nThe problem asks for an expression that links the rate constant $k$ to a known $Ct$ value and a specified base-$10$ log inactivation $L$. Rearranging the above equation gives the desired expression:\n$$ k = \\frac{L \\ln(10)}{Ct} $$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Log Inactivation**\n\nThe problem provides a reference data point: a $L_{ref} = 2.0$-log inactivation is achieved at a $Ct$ product of $(Ct)_{ref} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$ under the same $pH$ and temperature conditions. Since $k$ depends on these conditions, we can assume $k$ is the same for the reference case and the plant's operational case.\n\nFrom the relationship $L \\ln(10) = k (Ct)$, it is clear that for a constant $k$, the log inactivation $L$ is directly proportional to the $Ct$ product. We can write this as a ratio:\n$$ \\frac{L_{plant}}{(Ct)_{plant}} = \\frac{k}{\\ln(10)} = \\frac{L_{ref}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nRearranging to solve for the log inactivation at the plant, $L_{plant}$:\n$$ L_{plant} = L_{ref} \\frac{(Ct)_{plant}}{(Ct)_{ref}} $$\nThis relationship shows that we do not need to explicitly calculate the value of $k$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the $Ct$ product for the plant's operating conditions:\n-   Chlorine concentration $C_{plant} = 1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}$\n-   Contact time $t_{plant} = 30 \\ \\mathrm{min}$\n$$ (Ct)_{plant} = C_{plant} \\times t_{plant} = (1.0 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, L^{-1}}) \\times (30 \\ \\mathrm{min}) = 30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}} $$\nNow, we can calculate the expected log inactivation $L_{plant}$ using the reference values:\n-   Reference log inactivation $L_{ref} = 2.0$\n-   Reference $Ct$ product $(Ct)_{ref} = 7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}}{7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}} $$\n$$ L_{plant} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{30}{7200} = 2.0 \\times \\frac{1}{240} = \\frac{2}{240} = \\frac{1}{120} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to three significant figures:\n$$ L_{plant} = \\frac{1}{120} \\approx 0.0083333... $$\n$$ L_{plant} \\approx 0.00833 $$\n\n**Part 3: Mechanistic Justification for Chlorine Resistance**\n\nThe limited efficacy of free chlorine against *Cryptosporidium parvum* oocysts, as demonstrated by the very high required $Ct$ value of $7200 \\ \\mathrm{mg \\, min \\, L^{-1}}$ for a mere $2.0$-log kill, is primarily due to the unique structure of the oocyst wall. This wall is a robust, multi-layered barrier that protects the infective sporozoites inside.\n\nMechanistically, free chlorine (predominantly as hypochlorous acid, $HOCl$, at $pH=7$) acts by oxidizing vital cellular components. However, to be effective, the disinfectant must first penetrate the oocyst wall to reach these targets. The *C. parvum* oocyst wall is exceptionally impermeable to chemical oxidants. It is composed of a tough outer layer and a thick inner layer containing highly cross-linked proteins, including cysteine-rich proteins. This structure serves as a formidable physical and chemical barrier, consuming large amounts of the disinfectant before any significant damage can be inflicted upon the internal sporozoites. Consequently, the rate of penetration and reaction with critical internal sites is extremely slow, necessitating either very high chlorine concentrations or very long contact times to achieve effective inactivation, resulting in the observed high $Ct$ values.",

This indicates that the risk of developing cryptosporidiosis was $3.5$ times higher for diapered toddlers who participated in the wading-pool water-play compared to those who did not. This is a strong association. For the toilet-trained preschoolers, the risk ratio is $RR_{TP, WP} = \\frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2.0$, also indicating an elevated risk. The combination of a strong statistical association ($RR = 3.5$) in the most susceptible population (diapered toddlers) and the known biological plausibility—that *Cryptosporidium* oocysts are resistant to chlorination and frequently transmitted via recreational water—points to the wading pool as the most likely predominant route of transmission in this outbreak. The cases among non-exposed individuals likely represent secondary person-to-person transmission, which is also common with this pathogen.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the risk ratio for diapered toddlers, rounded to $4$ significant figures.\nThe calculated value is exactly $3.5$.
