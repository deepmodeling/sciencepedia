            "problem": "A neurotropic Lyssavirus (rabies virus) inoculated into peripheral tissue initially replicates locally and subsequently enters peripheral neurons, moving centripetally by retrograde axonal transport to the Central Nervous System (CNS). For the purpose of modeling the time to CNS involvement, assume that the dominant contribution is the axonal transport phase from the peripheral entry axon to the CNS entry zone, and that the local replication time is negligible compared with transport variability.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated for validity.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Virus and Mechanism**: Neurotropic Lyssavirus (rabies virus) moves via retrograde axonal transport.\n- **Assumption**: Local replication time at the inoculation site is considered negligible compared to the transport time.\n- **Variable**: Axonal transport speed, denoted by $V$.\n- **Distribution**: $V$ is a random variable following a uniform distribution, $V \\sim \\mathrm{Uniform}(50, 100)$, with units of $\\mathrm{mm/day}$.\n- **Exposure 1 (Finger)**: Path length $L_{\\mathrm{finger}} = 800$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Exposure 2 (Face)**: Path length $L_{\\mathrm{face}} = 120$ $\\mathrm{mm}$.\n- **Task 1**: Derive the expected time to Central Nervous System (CNS) involvement for each exposure, $E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}}]$ and $E[T_{\\mathrm{face}}]$.\n- **Task 2**: Compute the expected difference in time to CNS involvement, $E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}} - T_{\\mathrm{face}}]$.\n- **Final Answer Requirement**: The result for the expected difference must be in days, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on the established pathogenesis of rabies, where the virus travels from the periphery to the CNS via retrograde axonal transport. The transport speeds provided ($50$ to $100$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$) are consistent with empirical observations of fast axonal transport mechanisms ($50-400$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$). The anatomical path lengths are plausible for an adult human. The simplification of neglecting local replication time is explicitly stated as a modeling assumption, which is standard practice in biophysical modeling. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-defined. It provides all necessary parameters ($L_{\\mathrm{finger}}$, $L_{\\mathrm{face}}$) and the complete probability distribution for the transport speed $V$. The task is to calculate expected values, which is a standard procedure in probability theory. A unique solution exists and can be determined from the given information.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe time $T$ required for the virus to travel a distance $L$ at a constant speed $V$ is given by the fundamental kinematic relation:\n$$\nT = \\frac{L}{V}\n$$\nIn this model, the transport speed $V$ is not a constant but a random variable, described by a uniform probability distribution over the interval $[a, b]$, where $a=50$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$ and $b=100$ $\\mathrm{mm/day}$. The probability density function (PDF) of $V$, denoted $f_V(v)$, is:\n$$\nf_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{b-a} & \\text{for } a \\le v \\le b \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, we have:\n$$\nf_V(v) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{100-50} = \\frac{1}{50} & \\text{for } 50 \\le v \\le 100 \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nSince $T$ is a function of the random variable $V$, $T$ itself is a random variable. The problem asks for the expected time to CNS involvement, $E[T]$. For a continuous random variable, the expected value of a function $g(V)$ is given by $E[g(V)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(v) f_V(v) \\, dv$. Here, our function is $g(V) = T = L/V$.\n\nThe expected time, $E[T]$, can be calculated as:\n$$\nE[T] = E\\left[\\frac{L}{V}\\right]\n$$\nSince $L$ is a constant for a given exposure site, we can write:\n$$\nE[T] = L \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right]\n$$\nWe must first compute $E[1/V]$:\n$$\nE\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} f_V(v) \\, dv = \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} \\left(\\frac{1}{50}\\right) \\, dv = \\frac{1}{50} \\int_{50}^{100} \\frac{1}{v} \\, dv\n$$\nThe integral of $1/v$ is $\\ln|v|$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$\nE\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = \\frac{1}{50} \\left[ \\ln(v) \\right]_{50}^{100} = \\frac{1}{50} (\\ln(100) - \\ln(50)) = \\frac{1}{50} \\ln\\left(\\frac{100}{50}\\right) = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50}\n$$\nIt is crucial to note that $E[1/V] \\neq 1/E[V]$. For this uniform distribution, $E[V] = (a+b)/2 = (50+100)/2 = 75$, so $1/E[V] = 1/75$. However, $E[1/V] = \\ln(2)/50 \\approx 0.6931/50 \\approx 0.01386$, which is different from $1/75 \\approx 0.01333$. Using the incorrect assumption $E[1/V] = 1/E[V]$ would yield an erroneous result.\n\nNow, we can derive the expected time for each exposure.\nFor the finger exposure, $L_{\\mathrm{finger}} = 800$ $\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{finger}}] = L_{\\mathrm{finger}} \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = 800 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = 16 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nFor the face exposure, $L_{\\mathrm{face}} = 120$ $\\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[T_{\\mathrm{face}}] = L_{\\mathrm{face}} \\cdot E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right] = 120 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = \\frac{12}{5} \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days} = 2.4 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expected difference in time to CNS involvement, which we denote as $E[\\Delta T]$. Due to the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}} - T_{\\mathrm{face}}] = E[T_{\\mathrm{finger}}] - E[T_{\\mathrm{face}}]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 16 \\ln(2) - 2.4 \\ln(2) = (16 - 2.4) \\ln(2) = 13.6 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can first define the difference in time $\\Delta T$ as a function of $V$:\n$$\n\\Delta T = T_{\\mathrm{finger}} - T_{\\mathrm{face}} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}}}{V} - \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V} = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V}\n$$\nThen, we compute its expectation:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = E\\left[ \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}}{V} \\right] = (L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}}) E\\left[\\frac{1}{V}\\right]\n$$\nWith $L_{\\mathrm{finger}} - L_{\\mathrm{face}} = 800 \\, \\mathrm{mm} - 120 \\, \\mathrm{mm} = 680 \\, \\mathrm{mm}$:\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 680 \\, \\mathrm{mm} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln(2)}{50 \\, \\mathrm{mm/day}} = \\frac{68}{5} \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days} = 13.6 \\ln(2) \\, \\mathrm{days}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same analytical result. Now, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n$$\nE[\\Delta T] = 13.6 \\times \\ln(2) \\approx 13.6 \\times 0.69314718 \\approx 9.42679965...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $9.427$. The unit is days.",

In the context of rabies virus pathogenesis, rabies virus typically replicates locally in myocytes and connective tissue and then enters peripheral nerves to ascend centripetally to the central nervous system; the prophylactic principle is to provide immediate passive neutralizing antibody at the inoculation sites to prevent neuronal entry, with any remainder administered intramuscularly at a site anatomically distant from vaccination. Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) is dosed at $20$ International Units per kilogram ($20$ IU/kg). Assume an HRIG product concentration of $150$ IU per milliliter ($150$ IU/mL). To model anatomical feasibility of local infiltration and avoid excessive tissue pressure, assume each wound can accept infiltration up to a volumetric capacity proportional to its area, with capacity density $\\alpha = 0.1$ mL per $\\text{cm}^{2}$, and that the intended infiltration volumes are apportioned proportional to wound area. Any volume not infiltrated locally is administered intramuscularly into the vastus lateralis muscle, distant from vaccine administration sites.\n\nUsing these assumptions and starting from the above pathophysiologic and prophylactic principles, compute the intramuscular remainder volume to be administered. Express your final result in milliliters and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Rabies virus pathogenesis provides the rationale for local neutralization: the virus replicates at the inoculation site and accesses peripheral nerves; passive neutralizing antibody delivered into and around the wounds reduces infectious virions before neural invasion. Therefore, the operational objective is to infiltrate as much of the Human Rabies Immunoglobulin (HRIG) dose locally as anatomically feasible, with any excess administered intramuscularly (IM) at a site distant from vaccine injection to avoid antibody-vaccine interaction.\n\nFirst, compute the total HRIG dose in International Units (IU). The standardized, well-tested dosing rule for HRIG in post-exposure prophylaxis is $20$ IU/kg. For a patient mass $M = 70$ kg, the dose $D$ is\n$$\nD = 20 \\times 70 = 1400 \\ \\text{IU}.\n$$\n\nConvert this dose to a volume given the product concentration $C = 150$ IU/mL.

If the total available infiltration volume were less than or equal to the total capacity, proportional allocation would be achieved by choosing a proportionality constant $k$ so that $v_{i} = k A_{i}$ and $\\sum_{i} v_{i} = V_{\\text{infiltrate}} \\leq V_{\\text{cap,total}}$, with the additional constraint $v_{i} \\leq V_{i,\\max} = \\alpha A_{i}$ implying $k \\leq \\alpha$.

            "problem": "A mechanistic model of rabies virus incubation should connect peripheral events at the inoculation site to the time required for neuroinvasion and subsequent central nervous system involvement. Use the following fundamental base to derive a computable expression for the incubation time: viral population at the inoculation site grows according to exponential kinetics governed by the differential equation $dN/dt = r N$ with $N(0) = D_0$, where $N(t)$ is the local viral count at time $t$, $r$ is the local replication rate in day$^{-1}$, and $D_0$ is the initial inoculum dose in virions; neuroinvasion begins when the local viral population reaches a fixed neuroinvasion threshold $N_{\\mathrm{th}}$ (in virions); once neuroinvasion begins, the predominant movement to the central nervous system occurs via retrograde axonal transport approximated by uniform speed $v$ (in meter per day) along an effective path length $L$ (in meter).
