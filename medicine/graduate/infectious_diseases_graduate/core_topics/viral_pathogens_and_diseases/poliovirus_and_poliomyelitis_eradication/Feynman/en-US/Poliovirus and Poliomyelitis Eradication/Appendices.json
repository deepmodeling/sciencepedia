Consider a Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) model with an environmental contamination compartment. At the disease-free equilibrium, a single infectious person is introduced into a fully susceptible population at time $t=0$ with $S(0) \\approx N$. Transmission proceeds via two routes:\n\n- Direct oral–oral contact: an infectious individual makes $c$ potentially infectious contacts per day with randomly chosen persons, and each contact independently infects with probability $p_{d}$. Under homogeneous mixing with $S \\approx N$, the total rate of new infections generated by this index case via direct contact at time $t$ is $c\\,p_{d}$ while the individual remains infectious.\n- Environmental fecal–oral exposure: the environment has contamination level $E(t)$ that follows linear dynamics $dE/dt = \\sigma I(t) - \\delta E(t)$, where $I(t)$ is an indicator that the index case is infectious at time $t$, $\\sigma$ is the shedding rate into the environment, and $\\delta$ is the first-order decay rate of contamination.

The concepts of the basic reproduction number ($R_0$) and the herd immunity threshold ($H$) are fundamental principles in infectious disease dynamics. All terms are clearly defined, and the parameters provided are specified as plausible and are dimensionally consistent. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing sufficient information for a unique solution. It does not violate any scientific principles, contain contradictions, or rely on subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$\n\nThe basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is defined as the expected number of secondary infections produced by a single typical infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. It can be decomposed into two components corresponding to the two transmission routes:\n$$R_{0} = R_{0,d} + R_{0,e}$$\nwhere $R_{0,d}$ is the contribution from direct oral-oral contact and $R_{0,e}$ is the contribution from environmental fecal-oral exposure.\n\n**1. Direct Transmission Component ($R_{0,d}$):**\nAn infectious individual causes new infections through direct contact at a constant rate of $c p_{d}$, assuming the population is large and fully susceptible ($S/N \\approx 1$). The duration of the infectious period, let's call this random variable $\\tau$, is exponentially distributed with mean $T$. The recovery rate is $\\gamma = 1/T$, so the expected duration of the infectious period is $E[\\tau] = 1/\\gamma$.\n\nThe total number of secondary infections via the direct route for an individual who is infectious for a duration $\\tau$ is the rate multiplied by the duration, i.e., $c p_{d} \\tau$. To find the expected number of secondary infections for a typical case, we take the expectation over the random duration $\\tau$:\n$$R_{0,d} = E[c p_{d} \\tau] = c p_{d} E[\\tau]$$\nSubstituting $E[\\tau] = 1/\\gamma$, we get:\n$$R_{0,d} = \\frac{c p_{d}}{\\gamma}$$\n\n**2. Environmental Transmission Component ($R_{0,e}$):**\nThe rate of new infections from the environment is given by $\\alpha E(t)$. The total number of infections caused via the environment over the entire course of one individual's infection is the integral of this rate over all time:\n$$N_e = \\int_0^\\infty \\alpha E(t) dt$$\nTo find $R_{0,e}$, we need to find the expected value of $N_e$ over the distribution of infectious periods. First, let's find the total pathogen load contributed to the environment, $\\int_0^\\infty E(t) dt$. The dynamics of the environmental contamination $E(t)$ are given by the linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dt} = \\sigma I(t) - \\delta E(t)$$\nwhere $I(t)$ is an indicator function which is $1$ while the index case is infectious and $0$ otherwise. For an individual infectious for a duration $\\tau$ starting at $t=0$, we have $I(t)=1$ for $0 \\le t \\le \\tau$ and $I(t)=0$ for $t > \\tau$. We assume $E(0)=0$.\n\nWe can integrate the differential equation from $t=0$ to $t=\\infty$:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dE}{dt} dt = \\int_0^\\infty (\\sigma I(t) - \\delta E(t)) dt$$\n$$[E(t)]_0^\\infty = \\sigma \\int_0^\\infty I(t) dt - \\delta \\int_0^\\infty E(t) dt$$\nSince the contamination starts at zero ($E(0)=0$) and must eventually decay to zero after the source is removed ($E(\\infty)=0$), the left-hand side is $0$. The integral of the indicator function $I(t)$ is simply the duration $\\tau$.\n$$0 = \\sigma \\tau - \\delta \\int_0^\\infty E(t) dt$$\nSolving for the integrated contamination gives:\n$$\\int_0^\\infty E(t) dt = \\frac{\\sigma \\tau}{\\delta}$$\nThe total number of infections for this specific duration $\\tau$ is:\n$$N_e(\\tau) = \\alpha \\int_0^\\infty E(t) dt = \\frac{\\alpha \\sigma \\tau}{\\delta}$$\nTo find the expected number of secondary infections for a typical case, we take the expectation of $N_e(\\tau)$ over the random duration $\\tau$:\n$$R_{0,e} = E[N_e(\\tau)] = E\\left[\\frac{\\alpha \\sigma \\tau}{\\delta}\\right] = \\frac{\\alpha \\sigma}{\\delta} E[\\tau]$$\nSubstituting $E[\\tau] = 1/\\gamma$:\n$$R_{0,e} = \\frac{\\alpha \\sigma}{\\delta \\gamma}$$\n\n**3. Total Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$):**\nSumming the two components gives the total expression for $R_0$:\n$$R_{0} = R_{0,d} + R_{0,e} = \\frac{c p_{d}}{\\gamma} + \\frac{\\alpha \\sigma}{\\delta \\gamma}$$\nThis can be factored as:\n$$R_{0} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( c p_{d} + \\frac{\\alpha \\sigma}{\\delta} \\right)$$\n\n### Derivation and Calculation of the Herd Immunity Threshold, $H$\n\nThe herd immunity threshold ($H$) is the minimum proportion of a population that must be immune to an infection to prevent its spread. An epidemic cannot grow if the effective reproduction number, $R_{eff}$, is less than $1$. $R_{eff}$ is the number of secondary infections when a proportion of the population is already immune.\n\nFor a homogeneously mixing population, if a fraction $p$ of the population is immune (and thus not susceptible), the proportion of susceptible individuals is $1-p$. An infectious person's contacts will only lead to a new infection if the contact is with a susceptible person. Therefore, the effective reproduction number is reduced by the fraction of susceptibles in the population:\n$$R_{eff} = R_0 \\times (\\text{fraction susceptible}) = R_0 \\frac{S}{N}$$\nThe herd immunity threshold $H$ is the specific proportion of immune individuals at which $R_{eff}$ equals $1$. At this threshold, the proportion of susceptibles is $1-H$.\n$$1 = R_0 (1-H)$$\nSolving for $H$ gives the expression for the herd immunity threshold:\n$$1-H = \\frac{1}{R_0} \\implies H = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n\nNow, we will evaluate $H$ numerically using the provided parameter values.\nFirst, we determine the recovery rate $\\gamma$:\n$$T = 21 \\text{ days} \\implies \\gamma = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{21} \\text{ days}^{-1}$$\nNext, we calculate $R_0$ using the derived formula and the given parameters:\n$c = 10$, $p_{d} = 0.012$, $\\alpha = 0.004$, $\\sigma = 5$, $\\delta = 0.5$.\n$$R_0 = \\frac{1}{1/21} \\left( (10)(0.012) + \\frac{(0.004)(5)}{0.5} \\right)$$\n$$R_0 = 21 \\left( 0.12 + \\frac{0.02}{0.5} \\right)$$\n$$R_0 = 21 (0.12 + 0.04)$$\n$$R_0 = 21 (0.16)$$\n$$R_0 = 3.36$$\nNow we can calculate the herd immunity threshold $H$:\n$$H = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3.36}$$\n$$H = 1 - 0.29761904...$$\n$$H = 0.70238095...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$H \\approx 0.7024$$",

Your final numerical result must be provided as a decimal fraction. Round your final numerical answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the critical vaccination fraction, $p_{crit}$, required to bring the effective reproduction number, $R_e$, below $1$ in a leaky vaccination model, a numerical calculation for specific parameters, and a discussion of the model's limitations.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established epidemiological principles (SIR framework, $R_0$, herd immunity), is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may, therefore, proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the effective reproduction number, $R_e$. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, is the number of secondary cases generated by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The effective reproduction number, $R_e$, accounts for the reduced susceptibility in a population due to immunity or other factors. It is given by the product of the basic reproduction number and the average susceptibility of the population, $S_{eff}$.\n$$R_e = R_0 S_{eff}$$\n\nThe population is partitioned into two groups: a fraction $p$ that is vaccinated and a fraction $(1-p)$ that is unvaccinated. The unvaccinated individuals are fully susceptible, so their relative susceptibility is $1$. The vaccination is \"leaky,\" meaning it reduces the probability of infection upon contact by a proportion $E$. Therefore, the relative susceptibility of a vaccinated individual is $(1-E)$.\n\nThe average susceptibility of the population, $S_{eff}$, is the weighted average of the susceptibilities of these two groups:\n$$S_{eff} = (1-p) \\times 1 + p \\times (1-E)$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$S_{eff} = 1 - p + p - pE = 1 - pE$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for $R_e$ in terms of $R_0$, $p$, and $E$:\n$$R_e = R_0 (1 - pE)$$\n\nThe critical vaccination fraction, $p_{crit}$, is the minimum fraction of the population that must be vaccinated to ensure that the virus can no longer spread, which corresponds to the point where the effective reproduction number is reduced to the threshold value of $1$. We set $R_e = 1$ and solve for $p = p_{crit}$:\n$$1 = R_0 (1 - p_{crit}E)$$\n\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for $p_{crit}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_0} = 1 - p_{crit}E$$\n$$p_{crit}E = 1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}$$\n$$p_{crit} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{R_0}}{E}$$\nThis is the general expression for the critical vaccination fraction for a leaky vaccine model.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $p_{crit}$ using the provided parameters: $R_0 = 8.0$ and $E = 0.60$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$p_{crit} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{8.0}}{0.60}$$\nFirst, we evaluate the terms in the numerator:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{8.0} = 1 - 0.125 = 0.875$$\nNow we perform the division:\n$$p_{crit} = \\frac{0.875}{0.60} = \\frac{875}{600} = \\frac{35}{24}$$\n$$p_{crit} \\approx 1.458333...$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$p_{crit} \\approx 1.46$$\n\nThe calculated value $p_{crit} \\approx 1.46$ is greater than $1$. Since $p$ represents a fraction of the population, it cannot physically exceed $1$ (or $100\\%$ coverage). This mathematical result signifies that for a pathogen with such a high basic reproduction number ($R_0=8.0$), a vaccine with a mucosal efficacy against infection of only $E=0.60$ is insufficient to achieve herd immunity and halt transmission, even if the entire population ($p=1$) is vaccinated. The effective reproduction number at $100\\%$ coverage would be $R_e = R_0(1-E) = 8.0(1-0.60) = 8.0(0.40) = 3.2$, which is significantly greater than $1$.\n\nFinally, we discuss the scientific limitations of applying this simple threshold model to real-world poliomyelitis eradication using Oral Poliovirus Vaccine (OPV).\n1.  **Imperfect Immunity & Effect on Infectiousness**: The \"leaky\" model simplifies vaccine efficacy to a single parameter, $E$, reducing susceptibility. Real OPV-induced immunity is more complex. While it significantly reduces the risk of infection, it also has a crucial effect on post-infection viral shedding in breakthrough cases. Vaccinated individuals who still get infected shed less virus and for a shorter duration, making them less infectious. The model used here ($R_e = R_0 S_{eff}$) does not account for this reduction in infectiousness among vaccinated individuals who become infected, thereby overestimating the required vaccination level. A more sophisticated model would distinguish between susceptibility and infectivity.\n2.  **Vaccine-Derived Poliovirus (VDPV)**: OPV is a live-attenuated vaccine. The vaccine virus replicates in the gut and is shed, which can immunize unvaccinated contacts (a positive externality not in the model). However, during this circulation, the virus can mutate and revert to a neurovirulent form, leading to circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). These strains can cause outbreaks of paralytic polio in under-immunized populations. The simple SIR model is structurally incapable of capturing this critical dynamic of vaccine-virus evolution and transmission, which is a central challenge in the final stages of polio eradication.\n3.  **Homogeneous Mixing Assumption**: The model assumes homogeneous mixing, where every individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with any other individual. This is a profound oversimplification. Human populations are highly structured with non-random contact patterns (e.g., within families, schools, and local communities). Poliovirus transmission can persist in clusters of unvaccinated individuals even when the national average vaccination coverage ($p$) exceeds the theoretical $p_{crit}$. These pockets of low immunity are major obstacles to eradication.\n4.  **Dosage and Waning Immunity**: The problem frame \"after a single OPV round\" is a simplification. Achieving robust gut immunity with OPV typically requires multiple doses ($3$ or more). Furthermore, immunity (especially mucosal immunity) may wane over time, requiring periodic supplementary immunization campaigns to maintain population immunity above the herd immunity threshold. The static model does not capture these temporal dynamics.\n\nIn summary, while the $p_{crit}$ calculation provides a valuable first-order estimate of the challenge, its underlying assumptions limit its direct applicability and highlight the need for more complex models and multifaceted public health strategies for successful polio eradication.",

The likelihood function is $L(p | n, L) = \\binom{L}{n} p^n (1-p)^{L-n}$.\n\nThe maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the proportion $p$ is the observed sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{n}{L}\n$$\nTo find the MLE for the time $t$, we first invert the derived relationship to express $t$ as a function of $p$.\n$$\np = \\frac{3}{4}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\mu t}{3}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{4p}{3} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\mu t}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{4\\mu t}{3}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{4\\mu t}{3} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nt(p) = -\\frac{3}{4\\mu}\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4p}{3}\\right)\n$$\nBy the invariance property of maximum likelihood estimators, the MLE for $t$, denoted $\\hat{t}$, is found by substituting $\\hat{p}$ into the expression for $t(p)$.\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -\\frac{3}{4\\mu}\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4\\hat{p}}{3}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4\\mu}\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4n}{3L}\\right)\n$$\nThis formula provides the maximum likelihood estimate for the circulation time $t$.\n\n### Step 3: Calculation of Circulation Time\n\nWe are given the following data:\n- Number of nucleotide differences, $n = 28$.\n- Length of the VP1 coding region, $L = 906$ nucleotides.\n- Substitution rate, $\\mu = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2}$ substitutions per site per year.\n\nFirst, we compute the observed proportion of differences, $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{n}{L} = \\frac{28}{906}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the MLE formula for $\\hat{t}$:\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -\\frac{3}{4(1.00 \\times 10^{-2})} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{28}{906}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -\\frac{3}{0.04} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{112}{2718}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -75 \\ln\\left(\\frac{2718-112}{2718}\\right) = -75 \\ln\\left(\\frac{2606}{2718}\\right)\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -75 \\ln(0.9587932303\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{t} = -75 (-0.042079603\\dots)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{t} = 3.1559702\\dots\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\hat{t} \\approx 3.156 \\text{ years}\n$$\nThe estimated time of circulation for the virus lineage since its divergence from the vaccine strain is $3.156$ years.",
