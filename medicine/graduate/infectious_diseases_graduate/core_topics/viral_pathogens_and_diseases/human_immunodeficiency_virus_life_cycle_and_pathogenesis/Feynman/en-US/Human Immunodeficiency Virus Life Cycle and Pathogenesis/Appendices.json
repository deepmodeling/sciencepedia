This first exercise provides a tangible calculation to quantify the virus's inherent mutability.

            "problem": "The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a retrovirus renowned for its high genetic variability, a characteristic that poses significant challenges for vaccine development and antiviral therapy. This high mutation rate is primarily attributed to the lack of a proofreading mechanism in its reverse transcriptase enzyme, which transcribes the viral RNA genome into DNA. Consider a simplified model of HIV-1 replication. The single-stranded RNA genome of HIV-1 has a length of approximately 9749 nucleotides. The average error rate for the reverse transcriptase enzyme is estimated to be $3.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ substitutions per nucleotide base incorporated.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the expected number of new point mutations that will be introduced into the viral genome during a single cycle of reverse transcription, where the entire RNA genome is copied into a DNA strand.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "We model errors during reverse transcription as independent Bernoulli trials at each nucleotide position with probability $p$ of a substitution error per incorporated base. For a genome of length $L$, the expected number of point mutations introduced in one full copy is given by the linearity of expectation for a binomial process:\n$$\nE = L \\, p.\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $L = 9749$ nucleotides and $p = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ substitutions per nucleotide,\n$$\nE = 9749 \\times 3.0 \\times 10^{-5} = 0.29247.\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures yields $0.292$.",

            "introduction": "Building on the concept of high mutation rates, this practice delves into a sophisticated mechanism of antiretroviral drug resistance. While resistance often emerges from mutations within the drug's direct target, this problem explores a clinically important scenario where mutations in the enzyme's *substrate*—the Gag polyprotein—confer resistance to a protease inhibitor. Through the application of enzyme kinetics , you will analyze the complex trade-offs that allow the virus to maintain replicative fitness even under therapeutic pressure.",

            "problem": "A patient infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is undergoing antiretroviral therapy that includes a potent protease inhibitor. After an initial period of viral suppression, the patient's viral load rebounds, indicating the emergence of a drug-resistant strain. Subsequent genetic sequencing reveals a surprising result: the gene encoding the viral protease is identical to the wild-type (WT) sequence, meaning the enzyme itself is unchanged. However, a single point mutation is found in the viral `gag` gene, altering an amino acid at a primary cleavage site within the Gag polyprotein substrate.\n\nTo understand how this substrate mutation, rather than an enzyme mutation, can confer resistance, a kinetic analysis is performed. The wild-type protease is used to cleave both the wild-type Gag substrate (WT) and the mutated Gag substrate (Mut). The therapy maintains a steady-state intracellular concentration of the protease inhibitor, $[I]$. The inhibitor acts as a competitive inhibitor. Crucially, due to subtle conformational effects, the inhibitor's binding affinity for the protease depends on which substrate is being processed.\n\nYou are given the following kinetic parameters and in vivo concentrations:\n-   **Wild-type (WT) reaction:**\n    -   Catalytic constant, $k_{cat,WT} = 25.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n    -   Michaelis constant, $K_{m,WT} = 50.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n    -   Inhibition constant, $K_{i,WT} = 2.00 \\text{ nM}$\n-   **Mutated (Mut) reaction:**\n    -   Catalytic constant, $k_{cat,Mut} = 10.0 \\text{ s}^{-1}$\n    -   Michaelis constant, $K_{m,Mut} = 500.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n    -   Inhibition constant, $K_{i,Mut} = 80.0 \\text{ nM}$\n-   **In vivo concentrations:**\n    -   Gag polyprotein substrate concentration, $[S] = 75.0 \\text{ } \\mu\\text{M}$\n    -   Protease inhibitor concentration, $[I] = 198.0 \\text{ nM}$\n\nCalculate the relative processing rate of the mutant Gag polyprotein compared to the wild-type Gag polyprotein under these therapeutic conditions. This is given by the ratio of the reaction velocities, $v_{Mut} / v_{WT}$. Express your answer as a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "For a competitive inhibitor, the Michaelis–Menten rate law is\n$$\nv=\\frac{k_{cat}[E]_{T}[S]}{\\alpha K_{m}+[S]},\\quad \\alpha=1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}.\n$$\nFor the wild-type (WT) and mutant (Mut) substrates processed by the same protease, the ratio of velocities under the same enzyme and substrate concentrations is\n$$\n\\frac{v_{Mut}}{v_{WT}}=\\frac{k_{cat,Mut}}{k_{cat,WT}}\\cdot\\frac{\\alpha_{WT}K_{m,WT}+[S]}{\\alpha_{Mut}K_{m,Mut}+[S]},\n$$\nbecause the common factor $[E]_{T}[S]$ cancels.\n\nCompute the inhibitor factors for each substrate:\n$$\n\\alpha_{WT}=1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i,WT}}=1+\\frac{198}{2.00}=100,\n\\qquad\n\\alpha_{Mut}=1+\\frac{[I]}{K_{i,Mut}}=1+\\frac{198}{80.0}=3.475.\n$$\nInsert the given kinetic parameters and $[S]=75.0$:\n$$\n\\frac{v_{Mut}}{v_{WT}}\n=\\left(\\frac{10.0}{25.0}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{100\\cdot 50.0+75.0}{3.475\\cdot 500.0+75.0}\n=0.4\\cdot\\frac{5000+75}{1737.5+75}\n=0.4\\cdot\\frac{5075}{1812.5}.\n$$\nEvaluate the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{5075}{1812.5}=2.8 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{v_{Mut}}{v_{WT}}=0.4\\times 2.8=1.12.\n$$\nThus, the mutant Gag polyprotein is processed faster than the wild-type under these inhibitory conditions due to the much weaker inhibition in the mutant context.",

You will step into the role of a computational immunologist to predict how the virus evolves to escape a broadly neutralizing antibody by strategically acquiring mutations that form a protective \"glycan shield.\" This exercise  uses a simplified fitness model to illustrate how selective pressures drive the stepwise evolution of the viral envelope, offering a clear view of the co-evolutionary dynamics that present a major challenge for vaccine design.",

            "problem": "An immunologist is studying the co-evolution of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein `gp120` and the host antibody response in a single patient over a four-year period. The virus is under selective pressure from a specific broadly neutralizing antibody (bNAb). The bNAb's binding site, or epitope, on the ancestral `gp120` protein is known. The primary mechanism of viral escape is the acquisition of new Potential N-linked Glycosylation Sites (PNGS), which add bulky sugar molecules to the protein surface, creating a \"glycan shield\" that sterically blocks antibody binding.\n\nA simplified model is proposed to predict the evolutionary path of the virus. You are given the following information:\n\n**1. Ancestral `gp120` Sequence (Year 0):**\nA 20-amino-acid segment of the ancestral `gp120` protein is represented as:\n`M-A-E(3)-I-K(5)-G-S(7)-E-I-G-L-A(12)-V-S(14)-G-R-F-Y(18)-C(20)`\n\n**2. bNAb Epitope:**\nThe bNAb primarily targets the amino acid residues at positions `5`, `7`, and `18`.\n\n**3. Observed Mutations:**\nOver the four-year period, sequencing of the viral population has identified a pool of four recurring single-amino-acid mutations: `E3N`, `K5T`, `A12N`, `S14T`. The notation `XnY` means the amino acid `X` at position `n` is replaced by `Y`.\n\n**4. Evolutionary Fitness Model:**\nThe virus evolves in two steps: one mutation becomes fixed in the population by Year 2, and a second mutation becomes fixed by Year 4. The evolutionary path is determined by the total fitness gain over these two steps.\n\n-   **PNGS Definition:** A PNGS is created if the amino acid sequence contains the motif `N-X-S` or `N-X-T`, where `N` is Asparagine, `S` is Serine, `T` is Threonine, and `X` can be any amino acid except Proline (`P`).\n-   **Fitness Gain Calculation:** The change in fitness from a single mutation is calculated as:\n    `Net Fitness Gain = (Evasion Bonus) - (Functional Cost)`\n-   **Evasion Bonus (`B_evade`):** A bonus of `+15` units is awarded if a mutation leads to the creation of a **new** PNGS whose glycan shields at least one of the original epitope positions. A glycan attached at an introductory `N` of a PNGS is assumed to shield the protein backbone at positions `N-2` to `N+2` (inclusive). If a new PNGS is created but does not shield an epitope site, the bonus is `0`.\n-   **Functional Cost (`C_func`):**\n    -   There is a cost of `C_pngs = 6` units for any mutation that results in the formation of a **new** PNGS.\n    -   For any other mutation that does not create a new PNGS, there is a base cost of `C_other = 2` units.\n    -   **Exception:** The specific mutation `K5T` involves a change in charge and is structurally less favorable, incurring a higher cost of `3` units (instead of `2`) if it does not create a PNGS.\n\n**Question:**\nYour task is to evaluate all possible two-step evolutionary pathways using the mutations from the given pool. For each pathway, one mutation is fixed at Year 2, and a second, different mutation from the remaining pool is fixed at Year 4. Determine which pathway results in the highest cumulative fitness gain by the end of Year 4.\n\nWhich of the following ordered pairs of mutations represents the optimal evolutionary pathway?\n\nA.
