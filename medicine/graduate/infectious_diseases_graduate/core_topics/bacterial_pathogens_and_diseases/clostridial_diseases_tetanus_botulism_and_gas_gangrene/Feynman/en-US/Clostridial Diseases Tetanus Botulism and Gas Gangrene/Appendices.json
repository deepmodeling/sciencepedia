            "problem": "Clostridium tetani elaborates tetanus neurotoxin in a contaminated wound. Immediately after administration of human antitoxin immunoglobulin G (IgG), the wound interstitial space contains both neuronal receptor sites and antitoxin, each capable of binding the toxin. Consider a well-mixed microenvironment at constant volume, and model the following two reversible binding reactions under the law of mass action with one-to-one ($1{:}1$) stoichiometry and no cooperative effects:\n- Toxin ($T$) binding to antitoxin ($A$) to form $TA$.\n- Toxin ($T$) binding to neuronal receptor sites ($R$) to form $TR$.\n\nLet the equilibrium dissociation constants (defined by the law of mass action) be $K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}$ for $T$–$A$ and $K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}$ for $T$–$R$. The total molar concentrations in the microenvironment are $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, $[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, with no other sinks or sources for $T$. Assume monovalent effective binding of IgG to the toxin in this microenvironment due to steric constraints and that each receptor site binds at most one toxin molecule.\n\nStarting from the definitions of equilibrium dissociation constants and conservation of mass for each species, derive the equilibrium relations and, under the rigorously justified low-occupancy limit, calculate the fraction of total toxin bound by antitoxin at equilibrium, $f_{\\mathrm{A}} = [TA]/[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, for the following scientifically plausible parameter values:\n- $K_{d,\\mathrm{A}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{M}$,\n- $K_{d,\\mathrm{R}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$,\n- $[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$,\n- $[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$,\n- $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nExpress the final fraction as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the fraction of total tetanus toxin ($T$) bound to antitoxin ($A$) at equilibrium in a competitive binding scenario. The toxin can also bind to neuronal receptor sites ($R$).\n\nThe system is defined by two reversible reactions:\n$1$. $T + A \\rightleftharpoons TA$\n$2$. $T + R \\rightleftharpoons TR$\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principles governing this system: the law of mass action and the conservation of mass for each species.\n\nThe equilibrium state is described by the dissociation constants ($K_d$) for each reaction, which are defined as:\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{[T][A]}{[TA]}$\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{R}} = \\frac{[T][R]}{[TR]}$\nwhere $[T]$, $[A]$, and $[R]$ are the molar concentrations of free toxin, antitoxin, and receptor at equilibrium, respectively, and $[TA]$ and $[TR]$ are the concentrations of the bound complexes.\n\nThe total concentrations of each species are conserved. The mass balance equations are given by:\n$[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [T] + [TA] + [TR]$\n$[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [A] + [TA]$\n$[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [R] + [TR]$\n\nThe goal is to determine the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{[TA]}{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$. To do this, we must solve this system of five equations.\n\nWe can express the concentrations of the bound complexes in terms of the free concentrations from the $K_d$ definitions:\n$[TA] = \\frac{[T][A]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}}$\n$[TR] = \\frac{[T][R]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}$\n\nSubstitute these into the mass balance equation for the toxin:\n$[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [T] + \\frac{[T][A]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[T][R]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}$\n\nThis equation still contains the unknown free concentrations $[A]$ and $[R]$. The problem asks for a solution under the \"low-occupancy limit,\" which must be rigorously justified. The low-occupancy approximation is applicable when the total concentration of the ligand (toxin) is much smaller than the total concentrations of its binding partners (antitoxin and receptor).\n\nLet's examine the given parameter values:\n$[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\nWe observe that $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\ll [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ (specifically, $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} / [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{-4}$) and $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\ll [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ (specifically, $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} / [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$).\nBecause the total concentration of toxin is several orders of magnitude smaller than the total concentrations of both antitoxin and receptor, the maximum possible concentration of bound complexes ($[TA]$ and $[TR]$) is limited by $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. That is, $[TA] \\leq [T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $[TR] \\leq [T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\nConsequently, the amount of antitoxin and receptor that becomes bound is a minuscule fraction of their total amounts:\n$[TA] \\ll [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n$[TR] \\ll [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nThis rigorously justifies the low-occupancy approximation, which simplifies the mass balance equations for the antitoxin and receptor as follows:\n$[A] = [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [TA] \\approx [A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n$[R] = [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [TR] \\approx [R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$\n\nUnder this valid approximation, the free concentrations of the binding partners can be replaced by their total concentrations. Substituting these approximations into the mass balance equation for the toxin yields:\n$[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx [T] + \\frac{[T][A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[T][R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}$\n\nWe can factor out the free toxin concentration, $[T]$:\n$[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}} \\approx [T] \\left( 1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}} \\right)$\n\nSolving for $[T]$:\n$[T] \\approx \\frac{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}}$\n\nNow, we can express the fraction of interest, $f_{\\mathrm{A}}$, using our approximation.\n$f_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{[TA]}{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$\nUsing the simplified expression for $[TA]$:\n$[TA] = \\frac{[T][A]}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} \\approx \\frac{[T][A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}}$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $[T]$ into this equation for $[TA]$:\n$[TA] \\approx \\left( \\frac{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}} \\right) \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}}$\n\nFinally, we divide by $[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ to obtain the fraction $f_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$f_{\\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{[TA]}{[T]_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\approx \\frac{\\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}}}{1 + \\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} + \\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}}}$\n\nThis expression represents the fraction of toxin bound to antitoxin as the ratio of the binding potential of the antitoxin to the sum of all binding potentials (including the \"potential\" of the toxin to remain free, represented by the term $1$).\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{A}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$K_{d,\\mathrm{R}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n$[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, calculate the dimensionless ratios:\n$\\frac{[A]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-7}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-10}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{3} = 1500$\n$\\frac{[R]_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{d,\\mathrm{R}}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-7}} = \\frac{1}{50} = 0.02$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $f_{\\mathrm{A}}$:\n$f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx \\frac{1500}{1 + 1500 + 0.02} = \\frac{1500}{1501.02}$\n\nPerforming the final calculation:\n$f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 0.99932049...$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$f_{\\mathrm{A}} \\approx 0.9993$\n\nThis result indicates that, under these conditions, approximately $99.93\\%$ of the tetanus toxin is bound by the antitoxin at equilibrium, demonstrating the high efficacy of the antitoxin treatment due to its significantly higher affinity (lower $K_{d,\\mathrm{A}}$) and concentration compared to the neuronal receptors.",

            "problem": "Consider a bout of foodborne botulism due to neurotoxin from the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which impairs acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). A single skeletal muscle is modeled as a population of $N$ motor units. Each motor unit innervates $m$ muscle fibers, and each fiber has one NMJ. Let the externally imposed motoneuron drive be a nonnegative scalar $D$. Each motor unit $i$ has an activation threshold $T_i$ such that it is recruited if and only if $D \\geq T_i$. Assume $\\{T_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ are independent and identically distributed with density $g(t)$ supported on $[0,\\infty)$ and are independent of all other variables in the model.\n\nIn the absence of toxin, when motor unit $i$ is recruited, it produces a maximal force $F_i$ when all $m$ fibers are transmitting. Assume $F_i$ are fixed (but arbitrary) and independent of $T_i$. Force contributed by a recruited motor unit scales linearly with the number of its transmitting fibers: if $x_i$ of its $m$ NMJs transmit, the unit contributes force $\\frac{x_i}{m} F_i$.\n\nSuppose botulinum toxin blocks a total of $B$ NMJs across the muscle. The blocked NMJs are distributed uniformly at random across the $N m$ NMJs and remain nonfunctional for the duration of the measurement. A blocked NMJ contributes zero force.

Expected Force in the Normal State, $F_{\\mathrm{norm}}(D)$**\n\nThe total force in the normal state is the sum of forces contributed by each motor unit. A motor unit $i$ contributes force $F_i$ if it is recruited (i.e., if $D \\geq T_i$), and $0$ otherwise. We can represent this using an indicator variable, $I(D \\geq T_i)$, which is $1$ if $D \\geq T_i$ and $0$ otherwise.

The blocks are distributed uniformly at random, so the probability that any single NMJ is functional is:\n$$\np_{\\text{func}} = \\frac{Nm - B}{Nm} = 1 - \\frac{B}{Nm}\n$$\nThe variable $x_i$ is the number of functional NMJs in motor unit $i$, which has $m$ NMJs. The expected value $E[x_i]$ is the number of NMJs in the unit multiplied by the probability of any one being functional:\n$$\nE[x_i] = m \\cdot p_{\\text{func}} = m \\left( 1 - \\frac{B}{Nm} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $F_{\\mathrm{bot}}(D)$:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{bot}}(D) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{F_i}{m} \\cdot \\left[ m \\left( 1 - \\frac{B}{Nm} \\right) \\right] \\cdot G(D) = G(D) \\left( 1 - \\frac{B}{Nm} \\right) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} F_i\n$$\n\n**3.
