The model, while simplified (e.g., assuming linear additivity), is a standard approach for creating a tractable quantitative description of a complex biological system. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary variables defined and a clear objective. It is stated objectively and contains no internal contradictions or missing information, assuming that \"$x\\%$\" implies a fractional blocking factor of $\\frac{x}{100}$. This is a standard and reasonable interpretation. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression\n\nWe begin by formalizing the components of the opsonic index based on the provided information.\n\nLet $I_{0}$ be the baseline opsonic index. It is the sum of the contributions from the IgG-mediated pathway, $I_{\\text{IgG}}$, and the complement-mediated pathway, $I_{\\text{C3b}}$. The assumption of linear additivity gives:\n$$I_{0} = I_{\\text{IgG}} + I_{\\text{C3b}}$$\nThe problem states that the fractional contribution of the IgG Fc$\\gamma$R-mediated pathway to $I_{0}$ is $\\phi$. Therefore, we can express $I_{\\text{IgG}}$ as:\n$$I_{\\text{IgG}} = \\phi I_{0}$$\nConsequently, the fractional contribution of the complement-mediated pathway is $1-\\phi$, which gives:\n$$I_{\\text{C3b}} = (1 - \\phi) I_{0}$$\nThe sum of these components correctly recovers the total baseline index: $\\phi I_{0} + (1 - \\phi) I_{0} = (\\phi + 1 - \\phi) I_{0} = I_{0}$.\n\nNext, we consider the effect of Protein A, which blocks $x\\%$ of IgG Fc regions. This corresponds to a fractional blockade of $\\frac{x}{100}$. The problem states this causes a proportional reduction in the IgG-mediated opsonization. Let the new contribution from the IgG pathway be $I'_{\\text{IgG}}$. This new contribution is the original contribution reduced by the fraction that is blocked. Equivalently, it is the original contribution multiplied by the fraction of receptors that remain unblocked, which is $\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right)$.\n$$I'_{\\text{IgG}} = I_{\\text{IgG}} \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $I_{\\text{IgG}}$ in terms of $I_{0}$ and $\\phi$:\n$$I'_{\\text{IgG}} = (\\phi I_{0}) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right)$$\nThe problem also states that complement deposition is unchanged. Thus, the contribution from the complement pathway remains the same:\n$$I'_{\\text{C3b}} = I_{\\text{C3b}} = (1 - \\phi) I_{0}$$\nThe new total opsonic index, denoted by $I(x)$, is the sum of the modified and unmodified components, still under the assumption of linear additivity:\n$$I(x) = I'_{\\text{IgG}} + I'_{\\text{C3b}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I'_{\\text{IgG}}$ and $I'_{\\text{C3b}}$:\n$$I(x) = (\\phi I_{0}) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right) + (1 - \\phi) I_{0}$$\nThe objective is to find the change in the opsonic index, $\\Delta I$, defined as $\\Delta I = I(x) - I_{0}$. We calculate this difference:\n$$\\Delta I = \\left[ (\\phi I_{0}) \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right) + (1 - \\phi) I_{0} \\right] - I_{0}$$\nTo simplify, we can factor $I_{0}$ out of the entire expression:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{0} \\left[ \\phi \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{100}\\right) + (1 - \\phi) \\right] - I_{0}$$\nNow, distribute $\\phi$ inside the parenthesis:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{0} \\left[ \\phi - \\frac{\\phi x}{100} + 1 - \\phi \\right] - I_{0}$$\nThe $\\phi$ terms inside the bracket cancel out:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{0} \\left[ 1 - \\frac{\\phi x}{100} \\right] - I_{0}$$\nDistributing $I_{0}$:\n$$\\Delta I = I_{0} - \\frac{\\phi I_{0} x}{100} - I_{0}$$\nThe $I_{0}$ terms cancel, yielding the final expression for the change in the opsonic index:\n$$\\Delta I = - \\frac{\\phi I_{0} x}{100}$$\nThis result shows that the change in the opsonic index is a reduction (indicated by the negative sign) that is directly proportional to the baseline index $I_{0}$, the fractional importance of the IgG-mediated pathway $\\phi$, and the percentage $x$ of IgG Fc regions blocked by Protein A.",
