            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a relationship for the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and its subsequent use to determine the change in membrane permeability in a mutant bacterium. The solution proceeds in two stages: first, deriving the general formula for MIC based on the provided biophysical model, and second, applying this formula to the wild-type and mutant strains to find the permeability ratio.\n\nFirst, we establish the mass balance for the intracellular antibiotic concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The rate of change of the amount of antibiotic inside the cell, which is the product of intracellular concentration and cell volume $V$, is given by the difference between the total influx rate and the total efflux rate.\n\nThe total influx rate is the flux per unit area, $J$, multiplied by the cell surface area, $A$. The flux is given by $J = P(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})$, where $P$ is the permeability coefficient and $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the external concentration.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Influx} = J A = P(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})A $$\n\nThe efflux is a first-order process with rate constant $k_e$. The total rate of efflux is thus proportional to the amount of antibiotic inside, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}V$.\n$$ \\text{Rate of Efflux} = k_e C_{\\mathrm{in}}V $$\n\nThe differential equation for the intracellular amount, $C_{\\mathrm{in}}V$, is:\n$$ \\frac{d(C_{\\mathrm{in}}V)}{dt} = P(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})A - k_e C_{\\mathrm{in}}V $$\nSince the cell volume $V$ is constant, we can divide by $V$ to obtain the equation for the rate of change of concentration:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}}{dt} = P(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})\\frac{A}{V} - k_e C_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe problem specifies that the bacterium is a sphere of radius $r$, for which the surface-to-volume ratio is given as $A/V = 3/r$. Substituting this into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{dC_{\\mathrm{in}}}{dt} = P(C_{\\mathrm{out}} - C_{\\mathrm{in}})\\frac{3}{r} - k_e C_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\n\nThe MIC is defined as the external concentration, $C_{\\mathrm{out}}$, at which a steady-state ($dC_{\\mathrm{in}}/dt = 0$) intracellular concentration equal to the inhibitory concentration, $C^{\\star}$, is achieved. We set $dC_{\\mathrm{in}}/dt = 0$, $C_{\\mathrm{in}} = C^{\\star}$, and $C_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\mathrm{MIC}$:\n$$ 0 = P(\\mathrm{MIC} - C^{\\star})\\frac{3}{r} - k_e C^{\\star} $$\nWe now rearrange this equation to solve for MIC.

The MIC of the mutant is a factor of $s$ larger than the wild-type, so $\\mathrm{MIC_{mut}} = s \\cdot \\mathrm{MIC_{wt}}$.\n\nFor the wild-type strain:\n$$ \\mathrm{MIC_{wt}} = C^{\\star} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P} \\right) $$\n\nFor the mutant strain:\n$$ \\mathrm{MIC_{mut}} = C^{\\star} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P'} \\right) $$\n\nWe form the ratio $\\mathrm{MIC_{mut}}/\\mathrm{MIC_{wt}} = s$:\n$$ s = \\frac{C^{\\star} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P'} \\right)}{C^{\\star} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P} \\right)} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P'}}{1 + \\frac{k_e r}{3P}} $$\nOur goal is to solve for the ratio $P'/P$.

The simplest way is to use the complement of $P(T+)$.\n$$P(T-) = 1 - P(T+) = 1 - 0.07342 = 0.92658$$\nAlternatively, we can compute it from its components: $P(T-) = P(T- \\cap D) + P(T- \\cap \\neg D)$. We have $P(T- \\cap \\neg D) = 0.92354$. We need $P(T- \\cap D)$.\n$$P(T- \\cap D) = P(T- \\mid D, U)P(D \\mid U)P(U) + P(T- \\mid D, P)P(D \\mid P)P(P)$$\nUsing $P(T- \\mid D) = 1 - s$:\n$$P(T- \\cap D) = (1-s_u)p_u w_u + (1-s_p)p_p w_p$$\n$$P(T- \\cap D) = (1-0.97)(0.08)(0.60) + (1-0.92)(0.05)(0.40)$$\n$$P(T- \\cap D) = (0.03)(0.08)(0.60) + (0.08)(0.05)(0.40)$$\n$$P(T- \\cap D) = 0.00144 + 0.0016 = 0.00304$$\nSo, $P(T-) = P(T- \\cap \\neg D) + P(T- \\cap D) = 0.92354 + 0.00304 = 0.92658$. This confirms the result from $1-P(T+)$.\n\nFinally, we compute the $NPV$:\n$$NPV = \\frac{P(\\neg D \\cap T-)}{P(T-)} = \\frac{0.92354}{0.92658} \\approx 0.9967190...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $NPV = 0.9967$.\n\nThe overall Positive Predictive Value ($PPV$) is $0.8848$ and the overall Negative Predictive Value ($NPV$) is $0.9967$.",
