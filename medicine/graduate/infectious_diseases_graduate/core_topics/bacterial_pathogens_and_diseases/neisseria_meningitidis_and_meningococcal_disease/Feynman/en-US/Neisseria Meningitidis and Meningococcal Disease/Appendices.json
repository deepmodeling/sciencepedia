You are considering invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In a validated, high-risk emergency cohort of adolescents with similar presentations (fever and meningism, before physical examination findings are incorporated), the pretest probability of invasive meningococcal disease is $0.08$ (expressed as a decimal). A meta-analysis reports that the presence of purpura on examination has a positive likelihood ratio (LR$^+$) of $18.2$ for invasive meningococcal disease in this clinical context.\n\nUsing only foundational probability definitions, including Bayes’ theorem and the definitions of odds and likelihood ratios, determine the post-test odds of invasive meningococcal disease after observing purpura in this patient.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- The pretest probability of invasive meningococcal disease, $P(D)$, is $0.08$. The event $D$ represents the patient having the disease.\n- The positive likelihood ratio, $LR^+$, for the presence of purpura is $18.2$. The event $T^+$ represents a positive test, which is the observation of purpura.\n- The objective is to calculate the post-test odds of the disease after observing purpura.\n- The calculation must be based on foundational probability definitions.\n- The final answer must be a dimensionless number rounded to three significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem utilizes established concepts from epidemiology and medical diagnostics, namely pretest probability, likelihood ratios, and post-test odds. The scenario described—an adolescent with fever, meningism, and purpura being evaluated for invasive meningococcal disease—is a classic, factually correct clinical presentation. The numerical values provided for the pretest probability ($0.08$) and the likelihood ratio ($18.2$) are plausible for a high-risk cohort and a highly specific clinical sign. The problem is firmly based on the principles of Bayesian inference as applied to clinical reasoning.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information (pretest probability and likelihood ratio) to calculate the requested quantity (post-test odds). The relationship between these quantities is mathematically defined, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and clinical terms. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis will proceed from the foundational definitions of probability, odds, and likelihood ratios to derive the post-test odds.\n\nLet $D$ be the event that the patient has invasive meningococcal disease.\nLet $T^+$ be the event of a positive test finding, which in this case is the presence of purpura.\n\nThe pretest probability of disease is given as:\n$$P(D) = 0.08$$\n\nThe probability of not having the disease is the complement, $D^c$:\n$$P(D^c) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92$$\n\nThe **pretest odds** are defined as the ratio of the probability of having the disease to the probability of not having the disease before the test result is known:\n$$\\text{Pre-test Odds} = \\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92}$$\n\nThe **positive likelihood ratio ($LR^+$)** is defined as the ratio of the probability of a positive test in patients with the disease (sensitivity) to the probability of a positive test in patients without the disease ($1 - \\text{specificity}$):\n$$LR^+ = \\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}$$\nWe are given $LR^+ = 18.2$.\n\nThe quantity to be determined is the **post-test odds**, which are the odds of having the disease after observing a positive test result ($T^+$). The post-test odds are defined as:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\frac{P(D | T^+)}{P(D^c | T^+)}$$\n\nTo relate the post-test odds to the pretest odds and the likelihood ratio, we use Bayes' theorem. According to Bayes' theorem, the posterior probabilities $P(D | T^+)$ and $P(D^c | T^+)$ are:\n$$P(D | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}$$\n$$P(D^c | T^+) = \\frac{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}$$\n\nNow, we can form the ratio for the post-test odds:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\frac{P(D | T^+)}{P(D^c | T^+)} = \\frac{\\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+)}}{\\frac{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}{P(T^+)}} = \\frac{P(T^+ | D) P(D)}{P(T^+ | D^c) P(D^c)}$$\n\nBy rearranging the terms, we can separate the expression into two familiar components:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\left(\\frac{P(T^+ | D)}{P(T^+ | D^c)}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{P(D)}{P(D^c)}\\right)$$\n\nThis demonstrates the fundamental relationship:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = LR^+ \\times \\text{Pre-test Odds}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this relationship to find the solution.\nFirst, calculate the pre-test odds:\n$$\\text{Pre-test Odds} = \\frac{0.08}{0.92}$$\n\nNext, multiply by the positive likelihood ratio:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} = \\left(\\frac{0.08}{0.92}\\right) \\times 18.2$$\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} \\approx 0.08695652 \\times 18.2$$\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} \\approx 1.58239966$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\nThe first three significant figures are $1$, $5$, and $8$. The fourth digit is $2$, so we round down.\n$$\\text{Post-test Odds} \\approx 1.58$$\n\nThe post-test odds of invasive meningococcal disease after observing purpura are approximately $1.58$. This means that in a patient with this presentation, the disease is about $1.58$ times more likely than its absence.",

It presents a standard clinical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling problem.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem utilizes a one-compartment model with first-order elimination, which is a standard and widely accepted simplification for describing drug disposition. The parameters provided for ceftriaxone (half-life, volume of distribution, protein binding, CSF penetration) are within physiologically and pharmacologically realistic ranges.

The question is clear and singular: calculate the attainment margin.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe primary goal is to calculate the attainment margin, defined as the achieved fraction of the dosing interval where the free cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration exceeds the $MIC$ ($fT_{\\text{CSF},>\\text{MIC}}$) minus the required fraction of $0.66$.\n\nFirst, we establish the pharmacokinetic model. For a drug administered intravenously in a one-compartment model, the plasma concentration ($C_p$) as a function of time ($t$) after a single dose ($D$) is given by:\n$$C_p(t) = C_{p,0} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_{p,0}$ is the initial concentration and $k_e$ is the first-order elimination rate constant.\n\nThe elimination rate constant, $k_e$, is related to the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, by:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}$$\nUsing the given value $t_{1/2} = 8$ hours:\n$$k_e = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1}$$\n\nThe total volume of distribution, $V$, is calculated from the mass-specific value $v_d$ and the patient's body mass $m$:\n$$V = v_d \\times m = 0.12 \\text{ L/kg} \\times 70 \\text{ kg} = 8.4 \\text{ L}$$\n\nFor a multiple-dosing regimen at steady state, the concentration profile within a single dosing interval $\\tau$ (from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$) is described by:\n$$C_{p,ss}(t) = C_{p,max,ss} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\nwhere $C_{p,max,ss}$ is the peak plasma concentration at steady state, occurring at $t=0$ immediately after the IV dose. It is calculated by summing the geometric series of remaining drug from all previous doses:\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{D/V}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}$$\n\nWe can now substitute the known values:\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{2000 \\text{ mg} / 8.4 \\text{ L}}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\text{ h}^{-1} \\times 12 \\text{ h}\\right)} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - \\exp(-1.5 \\ln(2))} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - 2^{-1.5}}$$\n$$C_{p,max,ss} = \\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}} \\approx \\frac{238.1}{1 - 0.35355} \\approx 368.3 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nThe free drug concentration in plasma is $C_{p,free}(t) = f_u \\times C_p(t)$. The free drug concentration in CSF, $C_{CSF,free}(t)$, is given as a fraction $k_{\\text{pen}}$ of the free plasma concentration:\n$$C_{CSF,free,ss}(t) = k_{\\text{pen}} \\times C_{p,free,ss}(t) = k_{\\text{pen}} \\times f_u \\times C_{p,ss}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{p,ss}(t)$:\n$$C_{CSF,free,ss}(t) = k_{\\text{pen}} f_u C_{p,max,ss} \\exp(-k_e t)$$\n\nThe requirement is that $C_{CSF,free,ss}(t)$ remains above the $MIC$ of $0.25$ mg/L. To determine the fraction of the interval this condition holds, we can first check the minimum concentration during the interval, which occurs at the very end, at $t=\\tau$. This is the trough concentration, $C_{CSF,free,min,ss}$:\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} = C_{CSF,free,ss}(\\tau) = k_{\\text{pen}} f_u C_{p,max,ss} \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\n\nLet's calculate this value:\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} = (0.20) \\times (0.10) \\times \\left(\\frac{2000/8.4}{1 - \\exp(-k_e \\tau)}\\right) \\times \\exp(-k_e \\tau)$$\nThis can be simplified:\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} = k_{\\text{pen}} f_u \\frac{D/V}{\\exp(k_e \\tau) - 1}$$\nWe have $k_e \\tau = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{8} \\times 12 = 1.5 \\ln(2)$. Therefore, $\\exp(k_e \\tau) = \\exp(1.5 \\ln(2)) = 2^{1.5} = 2\\sqrt{2}$.\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} = (0.20)(0.10) \\frac{2000 \\text{ mg} / 8.4 \\text{ L}}{2\\sqrt{2} - 1}$$\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} \\approx 0.02 \\times \\frac{238.1}{2.8284 - 1} \\approx 0.02 \\times \\frac{238.1}{1.8284} \\approx 0.02 \\times 130.2 \\approx 2.604 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nNow we compare the minimum CSF concentration to the MIC:\n$$C_{CSF,free,min,ss} \\approx 2.604 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n$$MIC = 0.25 \\text{ mg/L}$$\nSince $C_{CSF,free,min,ss} > MIC$, the free drug concentration in the CSF remains above the MIC for the entire duration of the $12$-hour dosing interval.\n\nTherefore, the time above MIC, $t_{>\\text{MIC}}$, is equal to the dosing interval $\\tau$:\n$$t_{>\\text{MIC}} = \\tau = 12 \\text{ h}$$\n\nThe achieved fraction $fT_{\\text{CSF},>\\text{MIC}}$ is:\n$$fT_{\\text{CSF},>\\text{MIC}} = \\frac{t_{>\\text{MIC}}}{\\tau} = \\frac{\\tau}{\\tau} = 1.0$$\n\nThe problem asks for the attainment margin, which is the difference between the achieved fraction and the required fraction ($0.66$):\n$$\\text{Attainment Margin} = (\\text{Achieved } fT_{\\text{CSF},>\\text{MIC}}) - (\\text{Required Fraction})$$\n$$\\text{Attainment Margin} = 1.0 - 0.66 = 0.34$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\text{Attainment Margin} = 0.340$$\nThis positive margin indicates that the pharmacodynamic target for bactericidal activity is successfully met and exceeded with the specified dosing regimen.",

The condition for an epidemic to decline is that the Effective Reproduction Number, $R_e$, must be less than $1$. The minimal threshold is therefore calculated by setting $R_e$ equal to $1$.\n\nThe Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$, represents the number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population. The Effective Reproduction Number, $R_e$, is related to $R_0$ by the average susceptibility of the population at a given time. Specifically, $R_e$ is the product of $R_0$ and the average relative susceptibility of the population, which we denote as $\\bar{s}$.\n\n$$R_e = R_0 \\bar{s}$$\n\nThe population is partitioned into two groups: vaccinated and unvaccinated. Let $v$ be the fraction of the population that is vaccinated (the vaccination coverage). The fraction of the population that is unvaccinated is therefore $1-v$.\n\nThe problem states that unvaccinated individuals have no pre-existing immunity, so we can normalize their susceptibility to $1$.\nThe vaccine is described as \"leaky,\" reducing an individual's susceptibility to acquisition by a fraction $e$, where $0 < e \\leq 1$.
