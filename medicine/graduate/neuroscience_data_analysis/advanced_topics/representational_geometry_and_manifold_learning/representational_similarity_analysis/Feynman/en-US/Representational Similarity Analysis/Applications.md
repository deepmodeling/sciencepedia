## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Now that we have acquainted ourselves with the principles of Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we can turn to the truly exhilarating part of our journey: What can we *do* with this tool? We have in our hands a method for comparing the intricate, high-dimensional geometries of thoughts. What secrets can it unlock? As we shall see, this elegant idea opens doors not just to a deeper understanding of a single brain, but to building bridges between different brains, between brains and intelligent machines, and even between seemingly disparate fields of science. It is a testament to the power of a simple, unifying concept.

In this chapter, we will embark on an exploration of this vast landscape. We will begin in RSA's home territory of neuroscience, learning how it serves as a master key to map the brain's functions. We will then travel across disciplinary boundaries, witnessing how RSA provides a common language for dialogues with artificial intelligence and evolutionary biology. Finally, we will see how this powerful lens is being focused on some of the deepest questions science can ask, including the nature of consciousness itself.

### The Neuroscientist's Toolkit: Mapping the Brain in Space, Time, and Meaning

For the neuroscientist, the brain is a universe to be mapped. But unlike the cartographers of old, they seek to chart not just physical structures, but the territories of meaning, function, and information. RSA has become an indispensable suite of tools for this modern-day exploration.

One of the most fundamental questions is *where* information is processed. Imagine we have a theoretical model for how the brain represents, say, different animal species. We can build a model Representational Dissimilarity Matrix (RDM) from this theory. But where in the brain does the [neural representation](@entry_id:1128614) match our model? The "searchlight" RSA technique provides a beautiful answer. We can define a small, spherical "spotlight" of analysis that we systematically slide across the entire brain. At each location, we compute a local neural RDM from the activity within that sphere and compare it to our model RDM. By assigning the resulting similarity score to the center of the sphere, we can build a whole-brain map that glows brightly in regions where the neural geometry matches our model's predictions . This allows us to create stunning informational topographies, revealing, for instance, the specific patch of cortex that organizes visual objects according to their category.

But the brain is not a static map; it is a symphony unfolding in time. A visual stimulus is not processed all at once. It begins as a collection of lines and colors and, within a fraction of a second, resolves into a meaningful object. To capture these dynamics, we can turn to techniques with high temporal resolution, like Magnetoencephalography (MEG) or Electroencephalography (EEG). Time-resolved RSA allows us to compute a new neural RDM for every millisecond of processing. By comparing this rapidly evolving neural RDM to our models, we can track the "shape" of the representation as it changes over time . We can literally watch as a representation that initially reflects the stimulus's low-level visual properties transforms into one that reflects its abstract, semantic category.

This ability to distinguish between different kinds of information is one of RSA's greatest strengths. Suppose we find a brain region that responds differently to images of faces and tools. Is it truly representing the abstract *category* of the object, or is it merely responding to the fact that faces and tools have different low-level visual features (e.g., faces are curvy, tools are straight)? RSA allows us to become careful scientific detectives. We can construct multiple model RDMs: one for the high-level category and another for low-level visual statistics. Using techniques like [partial correlation](@entry_id:144470) or [multiple regression](@entry_id:144007), we can ask: what is the unique similarity between the neural RDM and the category model *after* we have accounted for any similarity explained by the low-level model  ? This allows us to rigorously disentangle competing hypotheses and isolate the pure, abstract representation we are looking for.

Finally, RSA can take us beyond studying isolated brain regions to understanding how they work together. "Representational connectivity" is a powerful extension where we compute RDMs for two different brain areas, $R_A$ and $R_B$, in response to the same set of stimuli. We then simply correlate the two RDMs. A high correlation suggests that both regions organize the stimuli in a similar way—that they share a common "representational language" . This can imply that the regions are in communication or are part of a larger, integrated processing network. By using robust, cross-validated measures to build our RDMs, we ensure that this connectivity reflects genuine shared structure, not artifacts of noise . Furthermore, by finding an appropriate transformation to align the activity patterns from different individuals before computing RDMs, a technique known as [hyperalignment](@entry_id:1126288), we can uncover shared representational geometries that might otherwise be obscured by idiosyncratic differences in brain anatomy . In all these cases, we can use methods like [multidimensional scaling](@entry_id:635437) (MDS) to take a "peek" at these high-dimensional geometries, projecting them down into a 2D or 3D space that we can visually inspect .

### The Bridge to Artificial Intelligence: A Conversation with Machines

In recent years, an exciting dialogue has opened up between neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown astonishing abilities in [object recognition](@entry_id:1129025), rivaling human performance. This has led to a tantalizing hypothesis: perhaps these networks learn to "see" in a way that is fundamentally similar to how the primate brain does. But how could we ever test this?

RSA provides the perfect bridge. We can treat a layer in a CNN exactly as we would a brain region. We present the same set of images to both the network and a living brain (say, a monkey's), and we record the responses—from the artificial units of a CNN layer and the biological neurons of a cortical area. We then construct an RDM for the CNN layer and an RDM for the brain area . The final step is breathtaking in its simplicity: we correlate the two RDMs. The resulting number gives us a quantitative score of how "brain-like" that specific layer of the network is.

This approach has revolutionized the field. We can now march through a deep network, layer by layer, and compare each one to different stages of the brain's [visual pathway](@entry_id:895544) . We consistently find that early layers of the network have representational geometries similar to early visual areas in the brain (like V1), while deeper layers have geometries that better match higher-level visual areas (like the inferior temporal cortex). This allows us to not only validate AI models against biological ground truth but also to use the models to better understand the brain's own computational architecture. We can compare dozens of different model RDMs against a neural RDM simultaneously, asking which combination of models best explains the brain's activity .

### A Universal Language for Complex Systems

Is the idea of "[representational geometry](@entry_id:1130876)" confined to the realm of biology and its silicon mimics? Or is it a more fundamental concept, applicable to any system that learns to process complex information? RSA's journey into other scientific disciplines suggests the latter.

Consider the challenge of designing new materials for batteries. Scientists use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a type of AI specialized for structured data, to predict material properties like [formation energy](@entry_id:142642). Now, suppose we have a GNN trained for this task and we want to adapt it to a completely new property, like the diffusion barrier for ions—a crucial factor for battery performance. This is a problem of "transfer learning." Which parts of the network have learned general principles of chemistry that will be useful for the new task, and which parts are too specialized to the old task?

Remarkably, RSA offers a direct answer. We can define a "label RDM" based on the pairwise differences in the known [diffusion barriers](@entry_id:1123706) of a set of materials. We can then compute a representation RDM from the embeddings at each layer of the GNN. By correlating the GNN's layer RDMs with the target property's RDM, we can quantify how well each layer's internal representation is already aligned with the structure of the new problem. This tells engineers which layers contain transferable knowledge and should be "frozen," and which are misaligned and need to be "retrained" or "fine-tuned" . Here, RSA acts as a powerful diagnostic tool, moving from the world of brains and neurons to that of atoms and energy barriers, demonstrating its profound generality.

### The Deep Questions: Evolution and Consciousness

Armed with this versatile tool, we can now turn our attention to some of the deepest and most challenging questions in science.

First, the question of our evolutionary past. When we see a similar cognitive ability in two distantly related species, like the ability of a crow and a primate to estimate quantities (numerosity), we face a classic puzzle. Is this a case of homology, where both species inherited the underlying computational mechanism from a common ancestor? Or is it analogy, where they independently evolved similar solutions to a common problem?

RSA allows us to probe this question at an unprecedented level of detail. Instead of just comparing behavior, we can compare the very geometry of the neural representations. The research program is clear: record neural [population activity](@entry_id:1129935) from the relevant brain regions—the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the primate and the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) in the bird—while they perform various numerosity tasks. If the RDMs from the crow's brain and the monkey's brain show a high correlation, it suggests they are organizing numerical information in a fundamentally similar way . By carefully designing these experiments—for instance, by controlling for low-level stimulus features and testing for generalization across different sets of stimuli—we can build a powerful case for a shared, homologous computational algorithm that has been conserved across hundreds of millions of years of evolution .

Finally, we confront the "hard problem" of consciousness. What is the physical signature of a subjective experience? How does the brain's activity differ when a stimulus is consciously perceived versus when it is processed without awareness? RSA provides a framework to test a fascinating hypothesis: that the brain's representation of the world becomes more abstract and categorically structured only when we are conscious of it.

Imagine an experiment where images are flashed so briefly that on some trials, a participant reports seeing them clearly, while on others, they report no awareness. We can use RSA to compare the neural geometry in these two conditions. We build one neural RDM from the "conscious" trials and another from the "unconscious" trials. We then test how well each of these neural RDMs correlates with a model RDM that captures the abstract category of the images (e.g., face vs. tool). If the hypothesis is correct, we should find a strong correlation between the neural and categorical models for conscious trials, but a weak or non-existent correlation for unconscious trials . To make this claim, we must be exquisitely careful, using methods like cross-validation to handle noisy data and partial regression to rule out confounds. But the very fact that we can formulate such a precise, testable question about the nature of consciousness is a triumph of modern scientific method.

From mapping the brain to conversing with AI, from designing new materials to probing the origins of our minds, the applications of Representational Similarity Analysis are as diverse as they are profound. What began as a clever method for analyzing brain data has revealed itself to be something far more universal: a mathematical language for describing and comparing the shape of knowledge, wherever it may be found.
