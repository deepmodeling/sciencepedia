            "problem": "You will analyze the effect of resampling a labeled brain parcellation atlas from a $1$ millimeter isotropic grid to a $2$ millimeter isotropic grid on label fidelity using two interpolation strategies and compute the resulting mislabeling rates. Treat the atlas as a three-dimensional array of integer region labels (parcels), where each element corresponds to a voxel. The base principles are: a brain parcellation atlas is a piecewise-constant label field on a voxel grid, and resampling a label field must not create new labels but reassign labels according to a rule. You must adhere to the following precise definitions to make the problem purely mathematical and fully reproducible.\n\nDefinitions and operators:\n- Let $A \\in \\mathbb{N}^{X \\times Y \\times Z}$ denote the original label atlas at $1$ millimeter resolution, with $X=Y=Z=8$. Let the set of labels be positive integers. Define a downsampling factor $s=2$.\n- The $2$ millimeter grid partitions the $1$ millimeter grid into non-overlapping blocks of size $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$. Index coarse-grid voxels by $(I,J,K)$ with $I \\in \\{0,\\dots,\\frac{X}{2}-1\\}$, $J \\in \\{0,\\dots,\\frac{Y}{2}-1\\}$, $K \\in \\{0,\\dots,\\frac{Z}{2}-1\\}$. The corresponding fine-grid indices in the block are $i \\in \\{2I,2I+1\\}$, $j \\in \\{2J,2J+1\\}$, $k \\in \\{2K,2K+1\\}$.\n- Define two downsampling operators:\n  1. Nearest-neighbor decimation $D^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$: for each coarse voxel $(I,J,K)$,\n     $$B^{(\\mathrm{nn})}_{I,J,K} \\equiv D^{(\\mathrm{nn})}(A)_{I,J,K} := A_{2I,\\,2J,\\,2K}.$$\n     This corresponds to picking the label at the top-left-front corner of each $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ block.\n  2. Majority-vote block mode $D^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$: for each coarse voxel $(I,J,K)$,\n     $$B^{(\\mathrm{mv})}_{I,J,K} \\equiv D^{(\\mathrm{mv})}(A)_{I,J,K} := \\arg\\max_{\\ell \\in \\mathcal{L}} c_{\\ell}(I,J,K),$$\n     where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the set of labels present in the block and $c_{\\ell}(I,J,K)$ counts how many of the $8$ fine voxels in the block have label $\\ell$. In case of a tie in the maximum count, choose the smallest label value among the tied labels.\n- Define an upsampling-by-replication operator $U$ that maps a coarse grid back to the fine grid by filling each $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ block with its coarse label:\n  $$C_{i,j,k} \\equiv U(B)_{i,j,k} := B_{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{i}{2} \\right\\rfloor,\\, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{j}{2} \\right\\rfloor,\\, \\left\\lfloor \\frac{k}{2} \\right\\rfloor}.$$\n- Define the mislabeling rate $r$ of a resampling pipeline $A \\mapsto B \\mapsto C$ as the fraction of fine-grid voxels whose upsampled label differs from the original:\n  $$r := \\frac{1}{XYZ} \\sum_{i=0}^{X-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{Y-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{Z-1} \\mathbf{1}\\big[ C_{i,j,k} \\neq A_{i,j,k} \\big],$$\n  where $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$ is the indicator function.\n\nTasks:\n- For each test atlas defined below, compute the mislabeling rate $r^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ using $D^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ followed by $U$ and the mislabeling rate $r^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$ using $D^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$ followed by $U$. Report both $r^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $r^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$ for each test.\n\nTest suite (each atlas is defined deterministically over indices $i \\in \\{0,\\dots,7\\}$, $j \\in \\{0,\\dots,7\\}$, $k \\in \\{0,\\dots,7\\}$):\n- Test $1$ (Uniform atlas): $A_{i,j,k} = 1$ for all $(i,j,k)$.\n- Test $2$ (Sparse corner impurity per block): $A_{i,j,k} = 1$ for all $(i,j,k)$ except that for every block start $(i,j,k)$ with $i \\in \\{0,2,4,6\\}$, $j \\in \\{0,2,4,6\\}$, $k \\in \\{0,2,4,6\\}$, set $A_{i,j,k} = 2$.\n- Test $3$ (Aligned planar boundary): $A_{i,j,k} = 1$ if $i < 4$, else $A_{i,j,k} = 2$.\n- Test $4$ (Misaligned planar boundary): $A_{i,j,k} = 1$ if $i < 5$, else $A_{i,j,k} = 2$.\n- Test $5$ (Three-dimensional checkerboard): $A_{i,j,k} = 1$ if $(i + j + k) \\bmod 2 = 0$, else $A_{i,j,k} = 2$.\n- Test $6$ (Deterministic multi-label heterogeneity): $A_{i,j,k} = \\big( (7 i + 11 j + 13 k) \\bmod 3 \\big) + 1$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- Your program must produce a single line containing a list of results for the $6$ tests in order.

The above definitions instantiate these principles on a discrete grid so that results are reproducible and testable.\n\nDeliverable:\n- Implement a complete, runnable program that constructs the test atlases, applies both resampling pipelines, computes the mislabeling rates as defined, and prints the results in the required format with six-decimal rounding.",
            "solution": "This problem requires the implementation and comparison of two distinct resampling pipelines for a $3$-dimensional categorical data field, known as a label atlas. The objective is to quantify the information loss, or \"mislabeling rate,\" incurred by downsampling the atlas from a fine grid to a coarse grid and then upsampling it back to the original resolution.\n\nThe fundamental components of the solution are:\n1.  The generation of six distinct initial atlases, denoted as $A \\in \\mathbb{N}^{8 \\times 8 \\times 8}$.\n2.  The implementation of two downsampling operators, $D^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $D^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$, which map the $8 \\times 8 \\times 8$ atlas $A$ to a $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ coarse atlas $B$.\n3.  The implementation of one upsampling operator, $U$, which maps the coarse atlas $B$ back to an $8 \\times 8 \\times 8$ atlas $C$.\n4.  The calculation of the mislabeling rate, $r$, for each pipeline and each test atlas.\n\nFirst, we construct each of the six test atlases, $A$, represented as a three-dimensional integer array of size $8 \\times 8 \\times 8$. Each atlas is generated according to its precise mathematical definition, providing a \"ground truth\" label for every voxel $(i,j,k)$.\n\nNext, we define the two resampling pipelines. Each pipeline consists of a downsampling step followed by an upsampling step.\nThe coarse grid of size $4 \\times 4 \\times 4$ partitions the original fine grid into $64$ non-overlapping blocks of size $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$.\n\nThe first pipeline uses a **nearest-neighbor decimation** operator, $D^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$. For each coarse voxel $(I,J,K)$, the label is determined by simply taking the label from the original atlas $A$ at the corner of the corresponding block with the lowest indices. Specifically, $B^{(\\mathrm{nn})}_{I,J,K} = A_{2I, 2J, 2K}$. This method is computationally simple but can be sensitive to the feature alignment with respect to the sampling grid.\n\nThe second pipeline uses a **majority-vote block mode** operator, $D^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$. For each block, this operator identifies the most frequently occurring label among the $8$ fine voxels within that block. The label of the coarse voxel $(I,J,K)$ is set to this mode: $B^{(\\mathrm{mv})}_{I,J,K} = \\arg\\max_{\\ell} c_{\\ell}(I,J,K)$. This method provides a more robust representation of the block's content, as it considers all voxels within it. The problem specifies a deterministic tie-breaking rule: if multiple labels share the same maximal frequency, the one with the smallest integer value is chosen. This ensures a unique result.\n\nBoth downsampled atlases, $B^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $B^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$, are then upsampled back to the original $8 \\times 8 \\times 8$ resolution using the same upsampling operator, $U$. This operator, defined as $C_{i,j,k} = B_{\\left\\lfloor i/s \\right\\rfloor, \\left\\lfloor j/s \\right\\rfloor, \\left\\lfloor k/s \\right\\rfloor}$ with $s=2$, performs a zero-order hold or replication. It fills each $2 \\times 2 \\times 2$ block in the fine grid with the single label value from its corresponding coarse voxel. The resulting upsampled atlases are denoted $C^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $C^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$.\n\nFinally, we quantify the error introduced by each pipeline. The mislabeling rate, $r$, is defined as the fraction of voxels in the upsampled atlas $C$ that do not match the original atlas $A$. This is calculated using the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}[\\cdot]$:\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{XYZ} \\sum_{i=0}^{X-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{Y-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{Z-1} \\mathbf{1}\\big[ C_{i,j,k} \\neq A_{i,j,k} \\big] $$\nWe compute this rate for both pipelines, yielding $r^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $r^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$.\n\nThe overall algorithm proceeds by iterating through each of the six test cases. For each case, the atlas $A$ is generated. Then, both $r^{(\\mathrm{nn})}$ and $r^{(\\mathrm{mv})}$ are computed and stored. The final output is an aggregation of these paired results. This systematic process allows for a direct comparison of how well nearest-neighbor versus majority-vote resampling preserves label fidelity across a variety of spatial patterns.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a series of standard neuroinformatic metrics to assess inter-subject variability and registration quality in cortical surface parcellations. The validation process confirms that the problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. All definitions and formulas are standard in fields such as information theory and statistics and are directly applicable to the analysis of neuroimaging data. The provided test cases are well-defined and serve to illustrate distinct scenarios of data variability. We can therefore proceed with a principled solution.\n\nThe overall approach is to create a computational pipeline that processes the given data for each test case—vertex count $V$, subject count $S$, label set $L$, adjacency structure, group atlas labels $g_v$, and individual subject labels $l_{s,v}$—to produce the required output triple $[\\bar{H}, \\rho, F]$.\n\nThe step-by-step procedure for a single test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Data Representation**: The inputs are represented using numerical arrays for efficient computation. The individual subject labels $l_{s,v}$ form a matrix of size $S \\times V$, the group atlas labels $g_v$ form a vector of size $V$, and the adjacency structure is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains the indices of neighboring vertices.\n\n2.  **Empirical Label Distribution ($p_{v,l}$)**: For each vertex $v$, we count the occurrences of each possible label $l \\in L$ across all $S$ subjects. These counts are then normalized by $S$ to yield the empirical probability distribution $\\{p_{v,l}\\}_{l \\in L}$ at that vertex. This results in a $V \\times K$ matrix of probabilities, where $K = |L|$.\n\n3.  **Shannon Entropy ($H_v$)**: Using the computed probabilities $p_{v,l}$, the Shannon entropy for each vertex $v$ is calculated as $H_v = -\\sum_{l \\in L} p_{v,l} \\log_e p_{v,l}$. The natural logarithm is used, and the convention $0 \\log_e 0 = 0$ is handled by ensuring that the logarithm is only computed for non-zero probabilities. This produces a vector of entropy values $\\{H_v\\}_{v=0}^{V-1}$. The mean entropy $\\bar{H}$ is then computed by averaging this vector.\n\n4.  **Group Atlas Agreement ($A_v$)**: For each vertex $v$, the agreement rate is the fraction of subjects whose label $l_{s,v}$ matches the group atlas label $g_v$. This is calculated as $A_v = \\frac{1}{S} \\sum_{s=0}^{S-1} \\mathbf{1}\\{l_{s,v} = g_v\\}$, yielding a vector of agreement rates $\\{A_v\\}_{v=0}^{V-1}$.\n\n5.  **Boundary Proximity Index ($B_v$)**: This index quantifies how close a vertex $v$ is to a boundary in the group atlas $g$. For each vertex $v$, we examine its neighbors $u \\in N(v)$. The index $B_v$ is the fraction of neighbors whose atlas label $g_u$ differs from $g_v$: $B_v = \\frac{1}{|N(v)|} \\sum_{u \\in N(v)} \\mathbf{1}\\{g_u \\neq g_v\\}$. This calculation produces a vector $\\{B_v\\}_{v=0}^{V-1}$.\n\n6.  **Correlation ($\\rho$)**: The Pearson correlation coefficient $\\rho$ is computed between the entropy vector $\\{H_v\\}$ and the boundary proximity vector $\\{B_v\\}$. The calculation follows the standard formula:\n    $$\\rho = \\frac{\\sum_{v=0}^{V-1} (H_v - \\bar{H})(B_v - \\bar{B})}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{v=0}^{V-1} (H_v - \\bar{H})^2}\\sqrt{\\sum_{v=0}^{V-1} (B_v - \\bar{B})^2}}$$\n    A special condition is implemented: if either $\\{H_v\\}$ or $\\{B_v\\}$ has zero variance (i.e., the corresponding denominator term is zero), $\\rho$ is defined as $0$.\n\n7.  **Registration-Sensitive Fraction ($F$)**: Each vertex $v$ is classified as \"registration-sensitive\" if it lies near an atlas boundary ($B_v \\ge \\tau_B$) and simultaneously exhibits low agreement with the group atlas ($A_v < \\tau_A$). The total fraction of such vertices, $F$, is computed by summing the indicator function $R_v = \\mathbf{1}\\{B_v \\ge \\tau_B \\land A_v < \\tau_A\\}$ over all vertices and dividing by $V$.\n\nThis complete sequence of computations is applied to each of the three test cases specified in the problem, and the final results are aggregated into the required output format.",
