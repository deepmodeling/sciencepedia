            "problem": "You are analyzing a simplified model of quadratic phase coupling in a local field potential recorded from cortex, where the signal is modeled as a sum of three harmonics with locked phases. Let the signal be\n$$\nx(t)=A_{1}\\cos(2\\pi f_{1} t+\\phi)+A_{2}\\cos(2\\pi f_{2} t+\\psi)+\\gamma\\cos(2\\pi(f_{1}+f_{2})t+\\phi+\\psi),\n$$\nwith $A_{1}>0$, $A_{2}>0$, $\\gamma>0$, $f_{1}>0$, $f_{2}>0$, $f_{1}\\neq f_{2}$, and fixed phases $\\phi\\in\\mathbb{R}$, $\\psi\\in\\mathbb{R}$. Assume $x(t)$ is observed over a long duration and treated as wide-sense stationary with zero mean, so that time averages are identified with ensemble averages.

            "solution": "To determine the bispectrum $B(f_{1},f_{2})$ and its phase, we will follow the process outlined in the problem statement: first, we compute the third-order moment $m_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2})$, and second, we compute its two-dimensional Fourier transform.\n\nTo simplify the calculation of the triple product in the definition of $m_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2})$, we express the signal $x(t)$ using complex exponentials. Let $\\omega_{1} = 2\\pi f_{1}$, $\\omega_{2} = 2\\pi f_{2}$, and $\\omega_{3} = 2\\pi(f_{1}+f_{2}) = \\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}$.

The complex Fourier coefficients $X_{k}$ are given by:\n$$\nX_{1} = \\frac{A_{1}}{2} e^{i\\phi}, \\quad X_{-1} = X_{1}^{*} = \\frac{A_{1}}{2} e^{-i\\phi}\n$$\n$$\nX_{2} = \\frac{A_{2}}{2} e^{i\\psi}, \\quad X_{-2} = X_{2}^{*} = \\frac{A_{2}}{2} e^{-i\\psi}\n$$\nThe third component exhibits phase locking, with its phase being the sum of the phases of the first two.\n$$\nX_{3} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} e^{i(\\phi+\\psi)}, \\quad X_{-3} = X_{3}^{*} = \\frac{\\gamma}{2} e^{-i(\\phi+\\psi)}\n$$\n\nThe third-order moment is defined as the time average of the triple product:\n$$\nm_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) = \\left\\langle x(t)x(t+\\tau_{1})x(t+\\tau_{2}) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the time average $\\lim_{T\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}(\\cdot)dt$. Substituting the complex exponential form:\n$$\nm_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) = \\left\\langle \\left(\\sum_{j} X_{j} e^{i \\omega_{j} t}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{k} X_{k} e^{i \\omega_{k} (t+\\tau_{1})}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{l} X_{l} e^{i \\omega_{l} (t+\\tau_{2})}\\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\n$$\nm_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) = \\sum_{j,k,l} X_{j} X_{k} X_{l} e^{i \\omega_{k} \\tau_{1}} e^{i \\omega_{l} \\tau_{2}} \\left\\langle e^{i (\\omega_{j}+\\omega_{k}+\\omega_{l}) t} \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe time average of a complex exponential $\\langle e^{i\\Omega t} \\rangle$ is $1$ if $\\Omega=0$ and $0$ otherwise. Therefore, only terms for which the frequencies sum to zero, $\\omega_{j}+\\omega_{k}+\\omega_{l}=0$, contribute to the sum.\nGiven the frequencies in our signal, $\\pm\\omega_{1}$, $\\pm\\omega_{2}$, and $\\pm(\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})$, the only non-trivial combinations that sum to zero are of the form $\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}-(\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})=0$ and $-\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}+(\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2})=0$. This corresponds to selecting one frequency from each of the three harmonic families. The sum for $m_{3}$ reduces to:\n$$\nm_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) = \\sum_{\\substack{j,k,l \\\\ \\omega_{j}+\\omega_{k}+\\omega_{l}=0}} X_{j} X_{k} X_{l} e^{i (\\omega_{k} \\tau_{1} + \\omega_{l} \\tau_{2})}\n$$\nThe bispectrum $B(f_{a}, f_{b})$ is the double Fourier transform of $m_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2})$:\n$$\nB(f_{a},f_{b}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} m_{3}(\\tau_{1},\\tau_{2}) e^{-i2\\pi (f_{a}\\tau_{1} + f_{b}\\tau_{2})} d\\tau_{1}d\\tau_{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $m_{3}$ and using the property that $\\mathcal{F}\\{e^{i( \\omega_{k} \\tau_{1} + \\omega_{l} \\tau_{2} )}\\} = \\delta(f_{a}-\\frac{\\omega_{k}}{2\\pi}, f_{b}-\\frac{\\omega_{l}}{2\\pi})$, we get:\n$$\nB(f_{a},f_{b}) = \\sum_{\\substack{j,k,l \\\\ \\omega_{j}+\\omega_{k}+\\omega_{l}=0}} X_{j} X_{k} X_{l} \\delta(f_{a}-f_{k}, f_{b}-f_{l})\n$$\nwhere $f_k = \\omega_k/(2\\pi)$. The bispectrum is a set of Dirac delta impulses located at frequency pairs $(f_{k}, f_{l})$ for which a corresponding $f_{j}$ exists such that $f_{j}+f_{k}+f_{l}=0$.\n\nWe need to find the bispectrum at the specific point $(f_{1}, f_{2})$. This means we are interested in the coefficient of the delta impulse $\\delta(f_{a}-f_{1}, f_{b}-f_{2})$. This specific impulse can only arise from terms in the sum where $f_{k}=f_{1}$ and $f_{l}=f_{2}$. Given the set of frequencies $\\{ \\pm f_1, \\pm f_2, \\pm(f_1+f_2) \\}$ and the constraint $f_1, f_2 > 0$ and $f_1 \\ne f_2$, the indices $k$ and $l$ are uniquely determined as $k=1$ and $l=2$.\n\nWith $k=1$ and $l=2$, the frequency condition $\\omega_{j}+\\omega_{k}+\\omega_{l}=0$ becomes $\\omega_{j}+\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}=0$. Since $\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}=\\omega_{3}$, this requires $\\omega_{j}=-\\omega_{3}$, which implies $j=-3$. Thus, only the single triplet of indices $(j,k,l)=(-3,1,2)$ contributes to the bispectrum at the point $(f_{1},f_{2})$.\n\nThe value of the bispectrum at this point is the coefficient of this specific delta impulse, which is $X_{-3}X_{1}X_{2}$. Let's compute this value:\n$$\nB(f_{1},f_{2}) = X_{-3}X_{1}X_{2} = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{2} e^{-i(\\phi+\\psi)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{A_{1}}{2} e^{i\\phi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{A_{2}}{2} e^{i\\psi}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nB(f_{1},f_{2}) = \\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8} e^{-i(\\phi+\\psi)} e^{i\\phi} e^{i\\psi} = \\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8} e^{i(-\\phi-\\psi+\\phi+\\psi)} = \\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8} e^{i0}\n$$\n$$\nB(f_{1},f_{2}) = \\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8}\n$$\nSince $A_{1}>0$, $A_{2}>0$, and $\\gamma>0$, the value of the bispectrum at $(f_{1},f_{2})$ is $\\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8}$, which is a real and positive constant. This demonstrates that the bispectrum is non-zero, as required.\n\nThe phase of the bispectrum, or biphase, is the argument of this complex value. For a positive real number, the phase is zero.\n$$\n\\arg B(f_{1},f_{2}) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{A_{1}A_{2}\\gamma}{8}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe reason the biphase is zero is a direct consequence of the quadratic phase coupling specified in the signal model. The phase of the third component at frequency $f_{1}+f_{2}$ is exactly the sum of the phases of the components at frequencies $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$, i.e., $\\phi+\\psi$. This precise phase relationship is what the bispectrum is designed to detect, and it results in a biphase of $\\phi+\\psi-(\\phi+\\psi)=0$.",

            "solution": "The analysis begins by relating the bispectrum, defined via the third-order cumulant, to the Fourier representation of the signal. For a zero-mean, stationary, real-valued random process $x[n]$, its bispectrum $B(\\omega_1, \\omega_2)$ can be expressed in terms of the signal's Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT), $X(\\omega)$. This relationship, a generalization of the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, is of the form $B(\\omega_1, \\omega_2) \\propto \\mathbb{E}\\{X(\\omega_1) X(\\omega_2) X(-\\omega_1 - \\omega_2)\\}$. For a real-valued signal $x[n]$, the DTFT exhibits Hermitian symmetry, $X(-\\omega) = X^*(\\omega)$, where the asterisk denotes complex conjugation. Consequently, the bispectrum is proportional to the expected triple product:\n$$\nB(\\omega_1, \\omega_2) \\propto \\mathbb{E}\\{X(\\omega_1) X(\\omega_2) X^*(\\omega_1 + \\omega_2)\\}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the bispectrum measures the statistical dependence, or phase coupling, among three frequency components: $\\omega_1$, $\\omega_2$, and their sum, $\\omega_3 = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$.\n\nThe phenomenon of aliasing arises from a fundamental property of the DTFT: it is inherently periodic with a period of $2\\pi$. This means that for any integer $k$, $X(\\omega) = X(\\omega + 2\\pi k)$. The third frequency component involved in the bispectral product, $\\omega_{\\text{sum}} = \\omega_1 + \\omega_2$, is subject to this periodicity.\n\nWhile the input frequencies $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are chosen from the principal branch $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, their sum $\\omega_{\\text{sum}}$ is not guaranteed to remain within this interval. It can take any value in the range $[-2\\pi, 2\\pi)$. If $\\omega_{\\text{sum}}$ falls outside the principal branch, it is aliased. A digital system processing the sampled data cannot distinguish between $\\omega_{\\text{sum}}$ and its alias, $\\omega_{\\text{alias}}$, which is the unique frequency in $[-\\pi, \\pi)$ that is congruent to $\\omega_{\\text{sum}}$ modulo $2\\pi$.\n\nThe alias mapping can be explicitly defined. If $\\omega_{\\text{sum}}$ exceeds the upper bound of the principal branch, i.e., $\\omega_{\\text{sum}} > \\pi$, its value wraps around. The system effectively \"sees\" an aliased frequency $\\omega_{\\text{alias}} = \\omega_{\\text{sum}} - 2\\pi$. Similarly, if $\\omega_{\\text{sum}} < -\\pi$, the alias is $\\omega_{\\text{alias}} = \\omega_{\\text{sum}} + 2\\pi$.\n\nThis concept is translated into the domain of physical frequencies (in $\\mathrm{Hz}$) using the relationship $f_k = \\omega_k f_s / (2\\pi)$. The principal angular frequency branch $[-\\pi, \\pi)$ corresponds to the physical frequency range $[-f_s/2, f_s/2)$, also written as $[-f_{\\text{Nyq}}, f_{\\text{Nyq}})$. For the analysis of real-valued signals, it is customary to focus on non-negative frequencies, $f \\in [0, f_{\\text{Nyq}})$.\n\nLet's consider two non-negative frequencies $f_1 \\ge 0$ and $f_2 \\ge 0$. The aliasing condition $\\omega_1 + \\omega_2 > \\pi$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi f_1}{f_s} + \\frac{2\\pi f_2}{f_s} > \\pi\n$$\nDividing by $2\\pi$ and multiplying by $f_s$ yields the condition for sum-frequency aliasing:\n$$\nf_1 + f_2 > \\frac{f_s}{2} = f_{\\text{Nyq}}\n$$\nWhen this inequality holds, the third frequency in the triad, $f_3 = f_1 + f_2$, lies outside the principal range $[0, f_{\\text{Nyq}})$. The alias mapping dictates that this frequency component will be indistinguishable from a component at frequency $f_{3, \\text{alias}}$ given by:\n$$\nf_{3, \\text{alias}} = (f_1 + f_2) - f_s\n$$\nThe direct consequence for practical bispectrum estimation is severe contamination. An estimate of $B(f_1, f_2)$ where $f_1 + f_2 > f_{\\text{Nyq}}$ may show a non-zero value, not because of a true quadratic phase coupling between components at $f_1$, $f_2$, and $f_1+f_2$, but due to a genuine coupling at a different set of frequencies that has been aliased. This makes it impossible to correctly interpret the source of the measured bispectral power, undermining the analysis.\n\nTo ensure valid and non-redundant bispectral estimates, a principled triad selection strategy is required. This strategy defines an admissible domain for the frequency pair $(f_1, f_2)$ based on two criteria:\n$1$. **Anti-aliasing:** All three interacting frequencies, $f_1$, $f_2$, and $f_1+f_2$, must be contained within the non-negative principal branch, $[0, f_{\\text{Nyq}}]$.\n$2$. **Non-redundancy:** For real signals, the bispectrum has symmetries, including $B(f_1, f_2) = B(f_2, f_1)$. To avoid redundant computations and data representation, a conventional ordering is imposed, such as $f_2 \\ge f_1$.\n\nCombining these criteria, the admissible domain for $(f_1, f_2)$ in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ is defined by the following set of inequalities:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nf_1 \\ge 0 \\\\\nf_2 \\ge f_1 \\\\\nf_1 + f_2 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis domain is a triangular region in the $(f_1, f_2)$ plane with vertices at $(0, 0)$, $(f_{\\text{Nyq}}/2, f_{\\text{Nyq}}/2)$, and $(0, f_{\\text{Nyq}})$.\n\nFinally, to find the maximum allowable frequency $f_2$ as a function of $f_1$ such that the third frequency, $f_1+f_2$, remains within the non-aliased principal branch, we consider only the anti-aliasing constraints. For non-negative frequencies, these are:\n$1$. $f_1 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}}$\n$2$. $f_2 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}}$\n$3$. $f_1 + f_2 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}}$\n\nFor any given $f_1$ in the valid range $[0, f_{\\text{Nyq}}]$, the constraint on $f_2$ is determined by the most restrictive of the above conditions. The third condition, $f_2 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}} - f_1$, is more restrictive than the second, $f_2 \\le f_{\\text{Nyq}}$, because $f_1 \\ge 0$. Therefore, the maximum allowable value for $f_2$ that prevents aliasing of the sum frequency is $f_{\\text{Nyq}} - f_1$. Substituting the definition $f_{\\text{Nyq}} = f_s/2$, we obtain the final analytical expression.",

This practice introduces the phase-randomization surrogate method, a powerful and widely used technique in computational neuroscience for hypothesis testing . By understanding how to construct surrogate data that preserves the power spectrum but destroys phase relationships, you will learn how to build a proper null distribution to rigorously assess the significance of your bispectral estimates.",

            "problem": "You are analyzing a local field potential (LFP) time series $x(t)$ recorded from rodent hippocampus during a behavioral task. Within $T = 10$ s epochs assumed weakly stationary, you observe pronounced narrowband power at frequencies around $8$ Hz and $12$ Hz and suspect quadratic phase coupling that could produce energy near $20$ Hz. You plan to estimate the bispectrum and bicoherence of $x(t)$ and to assess statistical significance by constructing a surrogate null distribution via phase randomization: for each epoch, compute the discrete Fourier transform, replace each Fourier phase by an independent sample from a uniform distribution on $[-\\pi,\\pi]$ under appropriate symmetry constraints, retain the original Fourier magnitudes, and inverse transform to obtain surrogate time series. You repeat this $1000$ times and compute the bicoherence for each surrogate to form an empirical null distribution at each frequency pair.\n\nFrom first principles of Fourier analysis and statistical signal characterization, select all statements that correctly explain why phase-randomized surrogates preserve the power spectrum of $x(t)$ while destroying phase coupling, and why this yields a valid bispectral significance test in this setting.\n\nA. Holding the Fourier magnitudes $|X(f)|$ fixed preserves the power spectrum and all second-order statistics of $x(t)$; replacing the phases by independent uniform random variables makes products of the form $X(f_{1})X(f_{2})X^{\\ast}(f_{1}+f_{2})$ have zero mean, so surrogate bicoherence is centered near zero under the null.\n\nB. Phase randomization preserves the marginal amplitude distribution (histogram) of $x(t)$ in the time domain, ensuring that surrogate-based bispectral thresholds control for non-Gaussianity in $x(t)$ without further adjustments.\n\nC. For a real-valued signal, imposing conjugate symmetry on the randomized Fourier coefficients is necessary to ensure the inverse transform is real-valued; this maintains the original amplitude spectrum on the positive frequencies and therefore preserves the power spectrum.\n\nD. Because randomizing phases destroys phase relations, it also flattens the power spectrum to that of white noise; this is why any residual bicoherence observed in the original data must be due to genuine coupling.\n\nE. The relevant null hypothesis is that $x(t)$ is a linear Gaussian process fully characterized by its power spectrum; under this null, the bispectrum vanishes, so the distribution of surrogate bicoherence values approximates the sampling distribution under the null, including finite-sample effects.\n\nSelect all that apply.",
            "solution": "This problem tests the conceptual understanding of using phase-randomized surrogates for statistical significance testing of bicoherence. The core idea is to create a null distribution of data that shares key properties with the original data (the power spectrum) but lacks the specific feature being tested for (phase coupling).\n\nLet the Fourier transform of the signal $x(t)$ be $X(f) = |X(f)| e^{i \\phi(f)}$.\n\n1.  **Power Spectrum Preservation**: The power spectrum is estimated from the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform, $|X(f)|^2$. The surrogate generation method explicitly retains the original magnitudes $|X(f)|$ and only randomizes the phases $\\phi(f)$. Therefore, the surrogate data will have the exact same power spectrum as the original data. By the Wiener-Khinchin theorem, preserving the power spectrum is equivalent to preserving the autocorrelation function, which fully defines the second-order statistics of a stationary process.\n\n2.  **Phase Coupling Destruction**: The bispectrum is estimated from the triple product $X(f_1)X(f_2)X^*(f_1+f_2)$. Its value depends on the consistent relationship between the phases: $\\phi(f_1) + \\phi(f_2) - \\phi(f_1+f_2)$. By replacing the original phases with independent random phases drawn from a uniform distribution, any such consistent relationship is destroyed. The expected value of the triple product for the surrogate data becomes zero, because the random phases cause cancellation upon averaging.\n\n3.  **Statistical Null Hypothesis**: This procedure generates surrogate data that conforms to the null hypothesis ($H_0$) that the signal is a linear Gaussian process whose properties are fully described by its power spectrum. Any higher-order correlations, such as quadratic phase coupling, are absent by construction. For any true linear Gaussian process, the theoretical bispectrum is identically zero. However, for a finite-length data sample, an *estimated* bispectrum or bicoherence will not be exactly zero due to random fluctuations. The distribution of bicoherence values from the surrogates provides an empirical estimate of this sampling distribution under $H_0$.\n\n4.  **Constraint for Real Signals**: For a time-domain signal $x(t)$ to be real-valued, its Fourier transform must exhibit conjugate symmetry: $X(f) = X^*(-f)$. This implies $|X(f)|=|X(-f)|$ and $\\phi(f) = -\\phi(-f)$. When creating surrogates, this symmetry must be enforced on the randomized phases (i.e., $\\phi_{\\text{surr}}(-f) = -\\phi_{\\text{surr}}(f)$) to ensure the inverse transformed surrogate signal is also real-valued.\n\nLet's evaluate the options based on these principles:\n\n**A**: This statement is correct. It accurately states that fixing $|X(f)|$ preserves the power spectrum and second-order statistics. It also correctly explains that randomizing phases makes the expected value of the bispectral product zero, causing surrogate bicoherence to be centered near zero.\n\n**B**: This statement is incorrect. A key consequence of the Central Limit Theorem is that an inverse Fourier transform of a signal with randomized phases tends toward a Gaussian amplitude distribution in the time domain. This process does *not* preserve the original signal's histogram (amplitude distribution) unless the signal was already Gaussian.\n\n**C**: This statement is correct. It highlights the crucial practical detail that for real-valued signals, conjugate symmetry must be imposed on the randomized phases. It correctly links this to ensuring a real-valued output and preserving the power spectrum.\n\n**D**: This statement is incorrect. It makes a fundamentally false claim. Phase randomization *preserves* the power spectrum; it does not flatten it to that of white noise. The purpose is to create colored noise with the same spectral shape as the original signal.\n\n**E**: This statement is correct. It provides a precise description of the statistical framework. The null hypothesis for this test is indeed that the signal is a linear Gaussian process, for which the bispectrum is zero. The surrogate distribution correctly approximates the sampling distribution of the bicoherence statistic under this null, which is essential for assessing significance while accounting for finite-sample effects.\n\nTherefore, statements A, C, and E are the correct explanations.",
