Derivation of the Algebraic Relationship and Calculation of $S$**\n\nThe problem asks to derive the algebraic relationship between PLV and PPC to verify the value of $S$. Let's start with the definition of the squared PLV, $|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 = |R|^2$.\n$$\n|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 = |R|^2 = R \\cdot R^* = \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} z_k\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} z_\\ell^*\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} z_k z_\\ell^*\n$$\nwhere $z_\\ell^* = \\exp(-i\\phi_\\ell)$ is the complex conjugate of $z_\\ell$.\nThe double summation can be split into terms where $k=\\ell$ and terms where $k \\neq \\ell$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} z_k z_\\ell^* = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} z_k z_k^* + \\sum_{k \\neq \\ell} z_k z_\\ell^*\n$$\nFor the diagonal terms ($k=\\ell$), we have $z_k z_k^* = |z_k|^2$. Since $|z_k|=1$, this product is $1$. The sum is $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} 1 = N$.\n\nFor the off-diagonal terms ($k \\neq \\ell$), we have a sum over $N(N-1)$ pairs. We can group these into pairs $(k, \\ell)$ and $(\\ell, k)$ and rewrite the sum over unique pairs where $k  \\ell$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\neq \\ell} z_k z_\\ell^* = \\sum_{1 \\le k  \\ell \\le N} (z_k z_\\ell^* + z_\\ell z_k^*)\n$$\nWe use the fact that $z_k z_\\ell^* = \\exp(i(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell))$ and $z_\\ell z_k^* = \\exp(i(\\phi_\\ell - \\phi_k)) = (z_k z_\\ell^*)^*$. The sum of a complex number and its conjugate is $z+z^* = 2\\operatorname{Re}(z)$.\n$$\nz_k z_\\ell^* + z_\\ell z_k^* = 2\\operatorname{Re}(z_k z_\\ell^*) = 2\\operatorname{Re}(\\exp(i(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell))) = 2\\cos(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell)\n$$\nThus, the sum of off-diagonal terms is:\n$$\n\\sum_{k \\neq \\ell} z_k z_\\ell^* = \\sum_{1 \\le k  \\ell \\le N} 2\\cos(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell)\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2$:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left( N + \\sum_{1 \\le k  \\ell \\le N} 2\\cos(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell) \\right) = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{2}{N^2} \\sum_{1 \\le k  \\ell \\le N} \\cos(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell)\n$$\nFrom the definition of PPC, we can express the sum of cosines as:\n$$\n\\sum_{1 \\le k  \\ell \\le N} \\cos(\\phi_k - \\phi_\\ell) = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\mathrm{PPC}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2$:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{2}{N^2} \\left( \\frac{N(N-1)}{2} \\mathrm{PPC} \\right) = \\frac{1}{N} + \\frac{N-1}{N} \\mathrm{PPC}\n$$\nThis is the general algebraic relationship between $|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2$ and $\\mathrm{PPC}$. Rearranging this equation gives:\n$$\n|\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 - \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{N-1}{N} \\mathrm{PPC} = 0\n$$\nThe scalar $S$ is defined as the left-hand side of this equation:\n$$\nS \\equiv |\\mathrm{PLV}|^2 - \\frac{1}{N} - \\frac{N-1}{N} \\mathrm{PPC}\n$$\nTherefore, $S$ must be identically equal to $0$ for any set of phases, as a matter of algebraic identity.\n\nTo fulfill the problem's requirement, we explicitly verify this using our computed values for the given phase set: $N=4$, $\\mathrm{PLV}=0$, and $\\mathrm{PPC}=-\\frac{1}{3}$.\n$$\nS = (0)^2 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{4-1}{4} \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS = 0 - \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{3}{4} \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nS = -\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3}{12} = -\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 0\n$$\nThe numerical evaluation confirms the result of the general derivation. The value of the scalar $S$ is $0$.",

The naive computation involves a double loop over $N$ trials, which has a quadratic time complexity. Let's explore an alternative based on vector summation in the complex plane.\n\nLet $S$ be the sum of the complex phasors:\n$$S \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{N} z_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$$\nThe squared magnitude of this sum, $|S|^2$, is:\n$$|S|^2 = S \\cdot S^* = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_i}\\right) \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{-i \\theta_j}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)}$$\nWe can split the double summation into two parts: terms where $i = j$ (diagonal or \"self-pair\" terms) and terms where $i \\neq j$ (off-diagonal or \"cross-pair\" terms).\n$$|S|^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i(\\theta_k - \\theta_k)} + \\sum_{i \\neq j} e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)}$$\nThe first sum evaluates to:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i(0)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} 1 = N$$\nThe second sum contains pairs of terms $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$. We can group them as follows:\n$$\\sum_{i \\neq j} e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)} = \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\left( e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)} + e^{i(\\theta_j - \\theta_i)} \\right)$$\nUsing the identity $e^{ix} + e^{-ix} = 2 \\cos(x)$, we have:\n$$e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)} + e^{i(\\theta_j - \\theta_i)} = 2 \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nSubstituting this back, the second sum becomes:\n$$\\sum_{i \\neq j} e^{i(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)} = 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nCombining all parts, we get the fundamental relationship:\n$$|S|^2 = N + 2 \\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nRearranging this equation to isolate the sum required for PPC, we find:\n$$\\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) = \\frac{|S|^2 - N}{2}$$\nNow, we can express PPC using this identity. Substituting into the definition of PPC:\n$$\\mathrm{PPC} = \\frac{2}{N(N-1)} \\left( \\frac{|S|^2 - N}{2} \\right) = \\frac{|S|^2 - N}{N(N-1)}$$\nFinally, let's relate this to PLV. From the definition of PLV, we have $|S| = N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}$, so $|S|^2 = N^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2$. Substituting this into our expression for PPC:\n$$\\mathrm{PPC} = \\frac{N^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - N}{N(N-1)} = \\frac{N(N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - 1)}{N(N-1)} = \\frac{N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - 1}{N-1}$$\nThis derived relationship shows that for a given sample, PPC is a function of PLV and the number of trials $N$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The naive enumeration of all unordered pairs requires $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ cosine evaluations, so its time complexity is $O(N^2)$; an aggregation-based identity using $S \\equiv \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$ reduces PPC computation to $O(N)$.**\nThe naive method computes $\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$ for all $\\binom{N}{2} = \\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$ unique pairs $(i, j)$ where $i  j$. The number of operations scales with $N^2$, so the time complexity is $O(N^2)$. This part is correct.\nThe aggregation-based method first computes $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$. This requires a single loop over the $N$ trials, performing a constant number of operations (exponentiation/trigonometric functions, complex addition) per trial. This step is $O(N)$. After computing $S$, the PPC is found via $\\mathrm{PPC} = \\frac{|S|^2 - N}{N(N-1)}$. Calculating $|S|^2$, subtracting $N$, and performing the division are all $O(1)$ operations with respect to $N$. Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by the initial sum, making it $O(N)$. This part is also correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. For any set of phases, the identity $\\sum_{1 \\le i  j \\le N} \\cos\\!\\big(\\theta_i - \\theta_j\\big) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\left|\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}\\right|^2 - N}{2}$ holds, and it enables computing $\\mathrm{PPC}$ in $O(N)$ time via a single pass to accumulate $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$.**\nThe identity presented is exactly what was derived above. It is a valid algebraic identity for any set of phases. As explained in the analysis of option A, using this identity allows for the computation of the sum, and subsequently PPC, in $O(N)$ time. The computation involves a single pass to accumulate $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$, followed by $O(1)$ operations.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. $\\mathrm{PPC} = \\mathrm{PLV}^2$ exactly for any $N$, hence PPC can be evaluated in $O(N)$ time by computing $\\mathrm{PLV} = \\frac{1}{N}\\left|\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}\\right|$.**\nOur derived relationship is $\\mathrm{PPC} = \\frac{N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - 1}{N-1}$.\nThis is not equal to $\\mathrm{PLV}^2$ in general. For them to be equal, we would need $\\frac{N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - 1}{N-1} = \\mathrm{PLV}^2$, which simplifies to $N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - 1 = N \\cdot \\mathrm{PLV}^2 - \\mathrm{PLV}^2$, or $\\mathrm{PLV}^2 = 1$. This only holds in the trivial case of perfect phase-locking. For any other case, the identity is false. While it's true that $\\mathrm{PPC} \\approx \\mathrm{PLV}^2$ for large $N$, the statement claims an exact equality for any $N$, which is incorrect. The premise of the statement is false, invalidating the entire claim.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. To avoid the $O(N^2)$ complexity, one must precompute $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{2 i \\theta_k}$; otherwise PPC cannot be reduced to $O(N)$.**\nThis statement claims that computing $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{2 i \\theta_k}$ is a necessary condition for an $O(N)$ algorithm. However, our derivation and the identity in option B show that PPC can be computed in $O(N)$ time using only $S = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}$. The term $\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{2 i \\theta_k}$ is not required for this efficient computation. Because we have a method that is $O(N)$ and does not use this term, the claim that it \"must\" be computed is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The unbiasedness of PPC with respect to the number of trials $N$ arises because the aggregation identity subtracts $N$ in the numerator, thereby canceling self-pair terms that would otherwise bias $\\left|\\sum_{k=1}^{N} e^{i \\theta_k}\\right|^2$ relative to the average over unordered pairs.**\nLet's analyze the source of bias in PLV-based measures. The squared magnitude of the mean phasor, $\\mathrm{PLV}^2 = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left|\\sum e^{i\\theta_k}\\right|^2$, is a biased estimator of the true population phase consistency. The bias originates from the \"self-pair\" or diagonal terms ($i=j$) in the expansion of $\\left|\\sum e^{i\\theta_k}\\right|^2$. As we derived, $\\left|\\sum e^{i\\theta_k}\\right|^2 = N + 2 \\sum_{ij} \\cos(\\theta_i-\\theta_j)$. The term $N$ represents the summed contribution of these self-pairs, which always contribute $1$ to the sum of squared magnitudes regardless of the phase distribution. This inflates the measure, particularly for small $N$.\nPPC is defined based on an average over only the cross-pairs ($i \\neq j$). The algebraic identity $\\mathrm{PPC} = \\frac{|S|^2 - N}{N(N-1)}$ shows how to achieve this: we start with $|S|^2$ (which is proportional to PLV$^2$ and contains the bias) and explicitly subtract the contribution from self-pairs ($N$). Then, we normalize by the number of cross-pairs, $N(N-1)$. This procedure removes the source of the sample size bias, and in fact, PPC is an unbiased estimator of the true squared phase consistency. The statement accurately describes this mechanism.\nVerdict: **Correct**.",

Examining the sample mean direction $\\hat{\\mu} = \\arg\\!\\left(\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{i \\phi_n}\\right)$ across resamples or time windows can help distinguish antipodal bimodal locking from unimodal locking: in the antipodal case with strong concentration, $\\hat{\\mu}$ will tend to flip between two directions approximately separated by $\\pi$, whereas in the unimodal case $\\hat{\\mu}$ will concentrate near a single direction.\n\nE. For any true phase locking, including symmetric antipodal bimodality, $r_1$ must eventually increase above $0$ as $N$ grows, so the PLV magnitude will become strictly positive with enough trials, and thus can be used alone to detect antipodal bimodal locking.\n\nSelect all correct options.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of phase-locking statistics under different generative models for phase data. We begin by establishing the fundamental quantities and their relationships based on the provided definitions.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be a random variable representing the phase, with a probability distribution $p(\\phi)$.\nThe first circular moment is defined as $m_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i \\phi}]$. By the law of large numbers, the sample mean $\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{i \\phi_n}$ converges to $m_1$ as the number of trials $N \\to \\infty$.\nThe phase-locking value (PLV) magnitude, in the large-sample limit, is $r_1 = |m_1| = |\\mathbb{E}[e^{i \\phi}]|$.\n\nThe pairwise phase consistency (PPC) is defined as the large-sample limit of the sample mean of $\\cos(\\phi_j - \\phi_k)$, which is $\\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\phi_j - \\phi_k)]$ for two independent trials $j$ and $k$. Since the phases $\\phi_j$ and $\\phi_k$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), we can write:\n$$\n\\text{PPC} = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos(\\phi_j - \\phi_k)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi_j \\cos\\phi_k + \\sin\\phi_j \\sin\\phi_k]\n$$\nBy independence, this becomes:\n$$\n\\text{PPC} = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi_j]\\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi_k] + \\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\phi_j]\\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\phi_k] = (\\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi])^2 + (\\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\phi])^2\n$$\nThe first circular moment is $m_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi] + i\\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\phi]$. Its magnitude squared is $|m_1|^2 = (\\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\phi])^2 + (\\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\phi])^2$.\nTherefore, we establish the crucial identity for the large-sample limit:\n$$\n\\text{PPC} = |m_1|^2 = r_1^2\n$$\nThis shows that PPC is simply the squared PLV magnitude in the population limit.\n\nWe now analyze the scenarios.\n\n**Unimodal Distribution:**\nThe distribution $p(\\phi)$ is unimodal and symmetric about a mean direction $\\mu$. Let $\\psi = \\phi - \\mu$. The distribution of $\\psi$ is unimodal and symmetric about $0$. The first moment is:\n$$\nm_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}] = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i(\\psi+\\mu)}] = e^{i\\mu}\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\psi}]\n$$\nSince the distribution of $\\psi$ is symmetric about $0$, $\\mathbb{E}[\\sin\\psi] = 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\psi}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\psi]$, which is a real number. For a concentrated distribution ($\\kappa  0$), phases are clustered, so $\\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\psi]  0$. Let $c_1 = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos\\psi] \\in (0, 1]$.\nSo, $m_1 = c_1 e^{i\\mu}$. The PLV magnitude is $r_1 = |m_1| = c_1  0$. The PPC is $r_1^2 = c_1^2  0$.\n\n**Symmetric Bimodal Distribution:**\nThe distribution is an equal-weight mixture of two identical unimodal components centered at $\\mu$ and $\\mu+\\pi$. Let the unimodal component distribution centered at $\\mu$ be $p_1(\\phi)$ and the one centered at $\\mu+\\pi$ be $p_2(\\phi)$. The mixture distribution is $p(\\phi) = 0.5 p_1(\\phi) + 0.5 p_2(\\phi)$.\nThe first moment is calculated using the law of total expectation:\n$$\nm_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}] = 0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{p_1}[e^{i\\phi}] + 0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{p_2}[e^{i\\phi}]\n$$\nFrom the unimodal analysis, the first moment of the component centered at $\\mu$ is $\\mathbb{E}_{p_1}[e^{i\\phi}] = c_1 e^{i\\mu}$.\nFor the component centered at $\\mu+\\pi$, the mean direction is shifted by $\\pi$. Thus, its first moment is $\\mathbb{E}_{p_2}[e^{i\\phi}] = c_1 e^{i(\\mu+\\pi)} = c_1 e^{i\\mu} e^{i\\pi} = -c_1 e^{i\\mu}$.\nSubstituting these into the mixture expectation:\n$$\nm_1 = 0.5 (c_1 e^{i\\mu}) + 0.5 (-c_1 e^{i\\mu}) = 0\n$$\nThis result is exact for any concentration $\\kappa  0$. Consequently, the PLV magnitude $r_1 = |m_1| = 0$, and the PPC is $r_1^2 = 0$.\n\n**Uniform Distribution (No Locking):**\nFor a uniform distribution on $[-\\pi, \\pi)$, $p(\\phi) = 1/(2\\pi)$.\n$$\nm_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}] = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} e^{i\\phi} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\phi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{e^{i\\phi}}{i} \\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} = \\frac{e^{i\\pi} - e^{-i\\pi}}{2\\pi i} = \\frac{2i\\sin(\\pi)}{2\\pi i} = 0\n$$\nThus, $r_1=0$ and $\\text{PPC}=0$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\nThis statement claims that for the symmetric bimodal case, $\\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}]=0$, so $r_1 \\to 0$ as $N \\to \\infty$, and PLV magnitude cannot distinguish this from a uniform phase distribution.\nOur derivation shows that for the symmetric bimodal case, the first circular moment $m_1 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i\\phi}]$ is indeed exactly $0$. By the law of large numbers, the sample PLV magnitude $r_1$ converges to $|m_1|=0$. For a uniform distribution, we also found $m_1=0$. Since the population-level statistic ($r_1$) is $0$ in both cases, any hypothesis test based on $r_1$ would be unable to distinguish between symmetric bimodal locking and a uniform distribution. Thus, the statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict on A: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\nThis statement claims that for the symmetric bimodal case, the large-sample PPC is $0$, and PPC also cannot distinguish this case from no locking (a uniform distribution).\nWe established that PPC $= r_1^2$. Since $r_1=0$ for the symmetric bimodal case, the PPC is also $0$. As shown before, for a uniform distribution (no locking), $r_1=0$ and thus PPC is also $0$. Therefore, PPC, like PLV, cannot distinguish between these two scenarios. The statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict on B: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\nThis statement proposes distinguishing the symmetric bimodal case from a uniform distribution by doubling the angles. This involves computing the second circular moment, $m_2 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i2\\phi}]$. The corresponding sample PLV would be $r_2 = |\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{i2\\phi_n}| \\to |m_2|$.\nFor the **symmetric bimodal** case:\n$$\nm_2 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i2\\phi}] = 0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{p_1}[e^{i2\\phi}] + 0.5 \\cdot \\mathbb{E}_{p_2}[e^{i2\\phi}]\n$$\nLet the unimodal component have a second moment about its mean of $c_2 e^{i2\\mu}$, where $c_2 = \\mathbb{E}[\\cos(2\\psi)]  0$ for a concentrated unimodal distribution.\nThe moment for the first component (centered at $\\mu$) is $\\mathbb{E}_{p_1}[e^{i2\\phi}] = c_2 e^{i2\\mu}$.\nFor the second component (centered at $\\mu+\\pi$), the moment is $\\mathbb{E}_{p_2}[e^{i2\\phi}] = c_2 e^{i2(\\mu+\\pi)} = c_2 e^{i2\\mu} e^{i2\\pi} = c_2 e^{i2\\mu}$.\nThe shift by $\\pi$ becomes a shift by $2\\pi$ after doubling, which is an identity rotation. Thus, both components have the same second moment.\n$$\nm_2 = 0.5(c_2 e^{i2\\mu}) + 0.5(c_2 e^{i2\\mu}) = c_2 e^{i2\\mu}\n$$\nSince $\\kappa0$, the unimodal components are concentrated, not uniform, which implies $c_2  0$. Thus, $|m_2| = c_2  0$.\nFor the **uniform distribution**:\n$$\nm_2 = \\mathbb{E}[e^{i2\\phi}] = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} e^{i2\\phi} \\frac{1}{2\\pi} d\\phi = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{e^{i2\\phi}}{2i} \\right]_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} = \\frac{e^{i2\\pi} - e^{-i2\\pi}}{4\\pi i} = 0\n$$\nSince $m_2 \\neq 0$ for the bimodal case but $m_2=0$ for the uniform case, computing $r_2$ or PPC on $2\\phi$ can indeed discriminate between them. The statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict on C: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\nThis statement suggests that the behavior of the sample mean direction $\\hat{\\mu} = \\arg(\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{i\\phi_n})$ across resamples or time windows differs between unimodal and antipodal bimodal locking.\nIn the **unimodal** case, phases are sampled from one cluster around $\\mu$. The sum $\\sum e^{i\\phi_n}$ will result in a vector whose direction $\\hat{\\mu}$ is a stable estimate of $\\mu$. Across different samples, $\\hat{\\mu}$ will have a low variance around $\\mu$.\nIn the **symmetric bimodal** case with strong concentration, each $\\phi_n$ is likely close to either $\\mu$ or $\\mu+\\pi$. In a finite sample of size $N$, let $N_1$ be the count of trials near $\\mu$ and $N_2$ be the count near $\\mu+\\pi$ ($N_1+N_2=N$). The vector sum is approximately:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^N e^{i\\phi_n} \\approx N_1 e^{i\\mu} + N_2 e^{i(\\mu+\\pi)} = N_1 e^{i\\mu} - N_2 e^{i\\mu} = (N_1 - N_2) e^{i\\mu}\n$$\nThe argument of this sum, $\\hat{\\mu}$, will be $\\mu$ if $N_1  N_2$ and $\\mu+\\pi$ if $N_2  N_1$. Since the two modes have equal weight, the values of $N_1$ and $N_2$ will fluctuate across different samples (time windows or resamples), causing $N_1-N_2$ to randomly be positive or negative. Consequently, the estimated direction $\\hat{\\mu}$ will flip between $\\mu$ and $\\mu+\\pi$. This bistable behavior of $\\hat{\\mu}$ is distinct from the stable behavior in the unimodal case. The statement is correct.\n\n**Verdict on D: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\nThis statement claims that for any true phase locking, including symmetric antipodal, $r_1$ will become strictly positive and can be used for detection.\nThis is incorrect. As proven for Option A, in the symmetric bimodal case, the true first circular moment is $m_1=0$. The sample statistic $r_1$ will fluctuate around $0$ for any finite $N$, and converge to $0$ as $N \\to \\infty$. Its expected value will decrease with $N$ (scaling as $1/\\sqrt{N}$). While for any finite $N$, the sample value $r_1$ is almost surely greater than $0$, it is statistically indistinguishable from a sample drawn from a uniform distribution, which also has a true moment of $0$. A statistical test based on $r_1$ would not be able to reject the null hypothesis of a uniform distribution. Therefore, $r_1$ (PLV magnitude) alone cannot be used to detect this specific type of phase locking.\n\n**Verdict on E: Incorrect**",
