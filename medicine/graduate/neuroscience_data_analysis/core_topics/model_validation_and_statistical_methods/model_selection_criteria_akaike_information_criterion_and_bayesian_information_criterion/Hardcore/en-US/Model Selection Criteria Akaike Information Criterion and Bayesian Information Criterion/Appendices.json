The decision is to be made using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Both criteria implement the principle of parsimony, balancing the goodness of fit with model complexity.\n\nA polynomial model of degree $d$ is a function of the form:\n$$ f(x; \\mathbf{\\beta}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{d} \\beta_j x^j $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{\\beta} = (\\beta_0, \\beta_1, \\dots, \\beta_d)$ is the vector of coefficients.\n\nFor a given dataset consisting of $n$ points $(x_i, y_i)$, the first step is to determine the optimal coefficients $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\beta}}$ for each model.

To prevent overfitting, we use information criteria that penalize model complexity. Under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian errors, the AIC and BIC are given by:\n$$ \\text{AIC} = n \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n}\\right) + 2k $$\n$$ \\text{BIC} = n \\log\\left(\\frac{\\text{RSS}}{n}\\right) + k \\log(n) $$\nHere, $n$ is the number of data points, and $k$ is the number of free parameters in the model. The problem explicitly states that $k$ is the polynomial degree plus one ($k=d+1$).\n- For the quadratic model ($d=2$), we have $k=2+1=3$.\n- For the cubic model ($d=3$), we have $k=3+1=4$.\n\nThe term $n \\log(\\text{RSS}/n)$ is related to the maximum likelihood of the model and represents the goodness of fit. The terms $2k$ (for AIC) and $k \\log(n)$ (for BIC) are penalty terms for model complexity. Since $\\log(n) > 2$ for $n \\ge 8$, BIC imposes a stronger penalty on complexity than AIC for datasets of this size.

A principled way to measure the discrepancy between the true distribution $f$ and a model distribution $g$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence, $D_{KL}(f||g)$. The goal is to select the model that minimizes the expected KLD.\n\nAkaike demonstrated that $-2\\ell_{max} + 2k$ is an approximately unbiased estimator for a quantity proportional to this expected KLD, where $k$ is the number of estimated parameters in the model. This gives rise to the Akaike Information Criterion:\n$$ \\text{AIC} = -2\\ell_{max} + 2k $$\nFor the linear-Gaussian model, the parameters are the $p$ regression coefficients (elements of $\\beta$) and the noise variance $\\sigma^2$. Therefore, the total number of estimated parameters is $k = p+1$.\n\n**Stage 3: Small-Sample Correction (AICc)**\n\nThe derivation of AIC relies on an asymptotic approximation ($n \\to \\infty$). When the sample size $n$ is not large relative to the number of parameters $k$, AIC can be a biased estimator and tends to favor overly complex models. For linear regression models with normally distributed errors, a less biased criterion, the AICc, was developed. It adjusts the penalty term for the number of parameters. The AICc is given by:\n$$ \\text{AICc} = \\text{AIC} + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} $$\nSubstituting the expression for AIC, we get:\n$$ \\text{AICc} = -2\\ell_{max} + 2k + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} $$\nThis is the final expression for AICc for the linear-Gaussian model, derived from the specified fundamental principles.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of AICc**\n\nWe are given the following values for the dataset:\n-   Number of observations, $n = 36$.\n-   Number of stimulus features (including intercept), $p = 6$.\n-   Residual sum of squares, $S = 18.0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of parameters, $k$:\n$$ k = p+1 = 6+1 = 7 $$\nNext, we calculate the maximized log-likelihood, $\\ell_{max}$, using the derived formula:\n$$ \\ell_{max} = -\\frac{36}{2} \\left[ \\log\\left(2\\pi\\right) + \\log\\left(\\frac{18.0}{36}\\right) + 1 \\right] $$\n$$ \\ell_{max} = -18 \\left[ \\log(2\\pi) + \\log(0.5) + 1 \\right] $$\n$$ \\ell_{max} = -18 \\left[ \\log(2\\pi) - \\log(2) + 1 \\right] = -18 \\left[ \\log(\\pi) + 1 \\right] $$\nUsing the values $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$ and $\\log(\\pi) \\approx 1.14473$, we have:\n$$ \\ell_{max} \\approx -18 (1.14473 + 1) = -18(2.14473) \\approx -38.60514 $$\nNow we calculate the standard AIC:\n$$ \\text{AIC} = -2\\ell_{max} + 2k \\approx -2(-38.60514) + 2(7) = 77.21028 + 14 = 91.21028 $$\nFinally, we calculate the correction term and add it to find AICc:\n$$ \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1} = \\frac{2(7)(7+1)}{36-7-1} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 8}{28} = \\frac{112}{28} = 4 $$\n$$ \\text{AICc} = \\text{AIC} + 4 \\approx 91.21028 + 4 = 95.21028 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{AICc} \\approx 95.21 $$",
