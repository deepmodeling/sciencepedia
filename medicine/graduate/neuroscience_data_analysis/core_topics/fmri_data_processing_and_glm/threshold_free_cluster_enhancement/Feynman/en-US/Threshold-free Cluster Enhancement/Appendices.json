There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem is free of scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradictions, or ambiguity. It is a well-defined computational problem within its specified domain.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION DERIVATION\n\nThe Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement (TFCE) score for a pixel (or voxel) $p$ with intensity $i_p$ is calculated by integrating the support it receives from clusters across all possible thresholds $h$. The general formula for the continuous case is:\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p) = \\int_{0}^{i_p} e(h)^E \\cdot h^H \\, dh\n$$\nwhere:\n- $i_p$ is the intensity of the pixel $p$.\n- $h$ is the intensity threshold, ranging from $0$ to $i_p$.\n- $e(h)$ is the extent (size) of the cluster to which pixel $p$ belongs at threshold $h$. A pixel is part of a cluster at threshold $h$ if its intensity is greater than or equal to $h$.\n- $E$ and $H$ are the user-defined exponents for extent and height, respectively. In this problem, we are given $E = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $H = 2$.\n\nThe image consists of three types of pixels: those in the central $3 \\times 3$ block with intensity $a_{\\ell} = 2$, a single isolated pixel with intensity $a_{h} = 5$, and the remaining pixels with intensity $0$.\n\n### TFCE Value for a Pixel in the Central Region\n\nLet's denote a pixel within the central $3 \\times 3$ region as $p_{\\ell}$. Its intensity is $i_{p_{\\ell}} = a_{\\ell} = 2$. The TFCE score is calculated by integrating from $h=0$ to $h=2$.\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{\\ell}) = \\int_{0}^{2} e(h)^E \\cdot h^H \\, dh\n$$\nWe must determine the cluster extent $e(h)$ for $p_{\\ell}$ for thresholds $h \\in (0, 2]$. For any such $h$, all pixels with intensity greater than or equal to $h$ are considered. In our image, this includes the nine pixels of the central region (intensity $2$) and the one isolated pixel (intensity $5$).\n\nThe problem states the central region is contiguous and the high-intensity pixel is isolated and \"outside\" this region. Based on $8$-connectivity, this means two separate clusters are formed for any $h \\in (0, 2]$:\n1.  A cluster consisting of the $3 \\times 3 = 9$ central pixels.\n2.  A cluster consisting of the single isolated pixel.\n\nThe pixel $p_{\\ell}$ belongs to the first cluster. Therefore, for any threshold $h$ in the integration range $(0, 2]$, the extent of the cluster containing $p_{\\ell}$ is constant and equal to $9$.\n$$\ne(h) = 9 \\quad \\text{for } 0  h \\le 2\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $E = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $H = 2$ into the integral:\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{\\ell}) = \\int_{0}^{2} (9)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot h^2 \\, dh = \\int_{0}^{2} 3 h^2 \\, dh\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{\\ell}) = 3 \\left[ \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{2} = \\left[ h^3 \\right]_{0}^{2} = 2^3 - 0^3 = 8\n$$\nThus, the TFCE value for any pixel in the central $3 \\times 3$ region is $8$.\n\n### TFCE Value for the Isolated High-Intensity Pixel\n\nLet's denote the isolated high-intensity pixel as $p_{h}$. Its intensity is $i_{p_{h}} = a_{h} = 5$. The TFCE score is calculated by integrating from $h=0$ to $h=5$.\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{h}) = \\int_{0}^{5} e(h)^E \\cdot h^H \\, dh\n$$\nWe must determine the cluster extent $e(h)$ for $p_{h}$ across its integration range $h \\in (0, 5]$. We analyze this in two steps:\n1.  For thresholds $0  h \\le 2$: As established before, the pixel $p_{h}$ is suprathreshold and forms a cluster of size $1$ because it is not contiguous with the central region. So, $e(h) = 1$.\n2.  For thresholds $2  h \\le 5$: In this range, the pixels of the central region (intensity $2$) are now below the threshold. The only pixel remaining above the threshold is $p_{h}$ itself. Therefore, it still forms a cluster of size $1$. So, $e(h) = 1$.\n\nFor the entire integration range $h \\in (0, 5]$, the pixel $p_{h}$ belongs to a cluster of extent $1$.\n$$\ne(h) = 1 \\quad \\text{for } 0  h \\le 5\n$$\nSubstituting the values $E = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $H = 2$ into the integral:\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{h}) = \\int_{0}^{5} (1)^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\cdot h^2 \\, dh = \\int_{0}^{5} 1 \\cdot h^2 \\, dh = \\int_{0}^{5} h^2 \\, dh\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\text{TFCE}(p_{h}) = \\left[ \\frac{h^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{5} = \\frac{5^3}{3} - \\frac{0^3}{3} = \\frac{125}{3}\n$$\nThus, the TFCE value for the isolated high-intensity pixel is $\\frac{125}{3}$.\n\n### Ratio of TFCE Values\n\nThe problem asks for the exact ratio of the TFCE value of the isolated high-intensity pixel to that of any pixel in the central region.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{TFCE}(p_{h})}{\\text{TFCE}(p_{\\ell})} = \\frac{\\frac{125}{3}}{8}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{125}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{125}{24}\n$$\nThe exact ratio is $\\frac{125}{24}$.",
