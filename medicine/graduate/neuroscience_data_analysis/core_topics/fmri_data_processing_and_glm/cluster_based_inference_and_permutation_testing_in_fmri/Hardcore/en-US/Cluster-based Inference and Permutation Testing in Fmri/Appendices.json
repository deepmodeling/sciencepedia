            "problem": "You are analyzing a mass-univariate functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) general linear model at the group level. Let there be $m = 100{,}000$ voxelwise hypothesis tests across a brain mask, each returning a $p$-value under a null distribution. You wish to control the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) at level $\\alpha = 0.05$ under arbitrary dependence across voxels. Starting only from the definition of FWER as the probability of at least one false positive and from Boole’s inequality (the union bound) as a well-tested probabilistic fact, derive the per-voxel significance threshold $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}}$ for the Bonferroni procedure that guarantees $\\mathrm{FWER} \\le \\alpha$ when a common per-voxel threshold is applied. Compute the resulting $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}}$ for the given values of $m$ and $\\alpha$.\n\nThen, consider the typical smoothness of fMRI statistical fields after spatial preprocessing, characterized by a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of $6\\,\\text{mm}$ with $2\\,\\text{mm}$ isotropic voxels. Using only first principles about spatial correlation, the notion of effective degrees of freedom, and the idea of maximum-over-field null distributions used by permutation-based cluster inference, explain qualitatively how spatial smoothness alters the effective number of tests and therefore the expected detection power relative to voxelwise Bonferroni correction. Further, argue why cluster-based permutation inference, which uses the permutation distribution of the maximum cluster extent or mass, often exhibits higher sensitivity than voxelwise Bonferroni at the same $\\alpha$ in such smooth fields. Do not compute any cluster thresholds; provide a conceptual argument.\n\nYour final answer should be the single real number for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}}$. Do not include any units. No rounding is required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical inference for neuroimaging data, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem consists of two parts. The first part requires the derivation of the Bonferroni correction threshold from first principles and its calculation for the given parameters. The second part requires a conceptual explanation of why cluster-based permutation inference is often more sensitive than voxelwise Bonferroni correction in the context of spatially smooth fMRI data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of the Bonferroni Threshold**\n\nWe are tasked with controlling the Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) for a set of $m = 100{,}000$ simultaneous hypothesis tests. The desired FWER level is $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\nLet $H_{0i}$ be the null hypothesis for the $i$-th voxel, where $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$. Let $V_0$ be the index set of voxels for which the null hypothesis is true. A Type I error, or a false positive, occurs if we reject $H_{0i}$ when $i \\in V_0$.\n\nThe FWER is defined as the probability of making at least one Type I error among all tests. Let $R_i$ be the event that we reject the null hypothesis $H_{0i}$. The FWER is then:\n$$ \\mathrm{FWER} = P \\left( \\bigcup_{i \\in V_0} R_i \\right) $$\n\nTo control the FWER under the most conservative assumption (i.e., the global null hypothesis where all $m$ null hypotheses are true, so $V_0 = \\{1, 2, \\dots, m\\}$), the expression becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{FWER} = P \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} R_i \\right) $$\n\nThe problem directs us to use Boole's inequality, also known as the union bound. For any collection of events $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_m$, the inequality states:\n$$ P \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} A_i \\right) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{m} P(A_i) $$\n\nApplying this inequality to the expression for FWER gives:\n$$ \\mathrm{FWER} = P \\left( \\bigcup_{i=1}^{m} R_i \\right) \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{m} P(R_i) $$\n\nIn a voxelwise hypothesis test, we reject the null hypothesis $H_{0i}$ if the corresponding $p$-value, $p_i$, is less than or equal to a predetermined per-voxel significance threshold, which we will denote as $\\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}}$. Thus, the event $R_i$ is equivalent to the event $p_i \\le \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}}$.\n\nBy the definition of a $p$-value, under a true null hypothesis $H_{0i}$, the probability of observing a $p$-value less than or equal to some value $\\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}}$ is $\\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}}$ itself. That is, for any $i \\in V_0$:\n$$ P(R_i) = P(p_i \\le \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}}) = \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}} $$\n\nSubstituting this into the inequality for the FWER, we get:\n$$ \\mathrm{FWER} \\le \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}} = m \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}} $$\n\nOur goal is to ensure that $\\mathrm{FWER} \\le \\alpha$. We can guarantee this by enforcing the condition on the upper bound of the FWER:\n$$ m \\cdot \\alpha_{\\text{per-voxel}} \\le \\alpha $$\n\nTo find the most stringent per-voxel threshold that satisfies this, we set the terms equal. This defines the Bonferroni-corrected threshold, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}}$:\n$$ m \\cdot \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}} = \\alpha $$\n\nSolving for $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}}$, we obtain the well-known formula for the Bonferroni correction:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{m} $$\nThis derivation holds regardless of the dependence structure among the tests, which is a key strength of the Bonferroni method.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given parameters: $m = 100{,}000$ and $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}} = \\frac{0.05}{100{,}000} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-2}}{1 \\times 10^{5}} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} $$\n\n**Part 2: Conceptual Comparison of Bonferroni and Cluster-Based Inference**\n\nThe Bonferroni correction, while robust, is notoriously conservative, especially when the number of tests $m$ is large, as in fMRI. Its conservatism is exacerbated when tests are positively correlated. The second part of the problem asks for a qualitative argument for why cluster-based permutation inference often shows higher sensitivity (i.e., statistical power) in spatially smooth fMRI data.\n\n1.  **Spatial Smoothness and the Effective Number of Tests:**\n    The Bonferroni correction $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{Bonf}} = \\alpha/m$ treats each of the $m=100{,}000$ voxels as an independent test. However, fMRI data are intentionally smoothed during preprocessing (e.g., to a FWHM of $6\\,\\text{mm}$ in this case), and the underlying BOLD signal itself is spatially diffuse. This spatial smoothness induces strong positive correlation between neighboring voxels. If a voxel shows a strong response, its immediate neighbors are also very likely to show a similar response. Consequently, the $m$ voxelwise tests are not independent. The information is redundant across space. The *effective* number of independent tests, $m_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is therefore much smaller than the total number of voxels, $m$. The Bonferroni correction does not account for this correlation, leading it to over-penalize for the number of tests and resulting in an unnecessarily stringent threshold ($5 \\times 10^{-7}$). This strictness reduces the probability of detecting true effects, thus lowering statistical power.\n\n2.  **Cluster-Based Inference and the Maximum Statistic Permutation Test:**\n    Cluster-based inference methods are designed to leverage this spatial correlation. Instead of testing the significance of each voxel's activation *intensity* in isolation, these methods test the significance of the *spatial extent* of activation. The typical procedure is as follows:\n    - A primary, uncorrected threshold (e.g., $p < 0.01$) is applied to the statistical map to define potential clusters of activation.\n    - For each contiguous cluster of suprathreshold voxels, a statistic is computed, such as its size (number of voxels, or \"extent\") or the sum of the statistical values within it (\"mass\").\n    - The core of the method is to determine if any of these observed clusters are larger than what would be expected by chance under the null hypothesis of no effect. This is achieved non-parametrically through a permutation test that correctly controls FWER.\n\n    The permutation test builds a null distribution for the *maximum cluster statistic*. The procedure involves:\n    - Randomly shuffling the experimental condition labels across subjects thousands of times.\n    - For each shuffled dataset, which represents a realization of the null hypothesis, a new statistical map is generated.\n    - The same primary threshold is applied, and the size (or mass) of the *largest* cluster found anywhere in the brain is recorded.\n    - The collection of these maximum cluster statistics across all permutations forms an empirical null distribution of the maximum cluster statistic.\n\n    The FWER is controlled at level $\\alpha$ by defining the critical cluster size as the $(1-\\alpha)$-th percentile of this null distribution. Any cluster in the original, non-permuted data that exceeds this critical size is deemed statistically significant.\n\n3.  **Why Cluster-Based Inference is More Sensitive:**\n    The increased sensitivity of cluster-based methods in smooth data stems from a fundamental shift in what is being tested.\n    - **Bonferroni correction** asks: \"Is the peak activation in any single voxel so intense that it's unlikely to be due to chance?\" To answer yes, a voxel must survive the extreme $\\alpha/m$ threshold.\n    - **Cluster-based inference** asks: \"Is there a spatially extended region of activation so large that it's unlikely to be due to chance?\"\n    A true neural activation, especially in smooth data, is likely to manifest as a spatially contiguous region of moderately elevated signal, not necessarily as a single voxel with an extraordinarily high statistical value. Such an effect might fail to produce any single voxel that passes the severe Bonferroni threshold. However, when viewed as a collective, these voxels form a large cluster. The permutation test correctly assesses that such a large cluster is very unlikely to arise from the spatially correlated noise under the null hypothesis. In essence, cluster-based inference pools statistical evidence across neighboring voxels, which is a more powerful strategy when the underlying signal itself is spatially extended. It directly models the spatial nature of the signal, whereas voxelwise Bonferroni completely ignores it. This alignment between the statistical test and the spatial characteristics of the signal is the primary reason for the superior sensitivity of cluster-based inference in typical fMRI analyses.",

Let us first establish the statistical principles and interpret the provided results.\n\nThe analysis involves two separate, FWER-controlled statistical tests performed on the same dataset, with a family-wise error rate (FWER) controlled at $\\alpha = 0.05$.\n\n**1. Voxel-wise FWER Control:**\nThis test aims to identify individual voxels showing a statistically significant effect, while controlling the probability of making one or more false positive claims across all voxels in the brain. The method used is a maximum statistic permutation test.\n-   A null distribution of the maximum voxel-wise statistic ($T$) is generated from $N = 5000$ permutations.\n-   The critical threshold for FWER control at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is the $95$th percentile of this distribution, given as $T_{0.95} = 5.1$.\n-   Any observed voxel with a statistic $T_{\\text{obs}}$ such that $T_{\\text{obs}} > T_{0.95}$ is considered statistically significant.\n-   In the provided data, a peak voxel is observed with $T_{\\text{peak}} = 5.2$.\n-   Since $T_{\\text{peak}} = 5.2 > T_{0.95} = 5.1$, we can reject the null hypothesis of no effect for this specific voxel. The associated adjusted $p$-value is $p_{\\text{FWER}} < 0.05$. This provides a valid inference that there is an effect localized to this particular voxel.\n\n**2. Cluster-wise FWER Control (Cluster Extent):**\nThis test aims to identify significant spatial clusters of activation, where the evidence for a cluster is its spatial extent (number of voxels). It controls the FWER for the family of all suprathreshold clusters.\n-   The data is first thresholded at a cluster-forming threshold $u$ (here, corresponding to uncorrected $p < 0.001$).\n-   A null distribution of the maximum cluster extent ($E$) is generated from $N = 5000$ permutations.\n-   The critical threshold for FWER control at $\\alpha = 0.05$ is the $95$th percentile of this distribution, given as $E_{0.95} = 160$ voxels.\n-   Any observed cluster with an extent $E_{\\text{obs}}$ such that $E_{\\text{obs}} > E_{0.95}$ is considered statistically significant.\n-   In the provided data, the largest (and only) observed cluster has an extent of $E_{\\text{obs}} = 140$ voxels.\n-   Since $E_{\\text{obs}} = 140 < E_{0.95} = 160$, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. The associated adjusted $p$-value for this cluster is $p_{\\text{FWER}} > 0.05$. This means we cannot make a statistical inference about the presence of an effect anywhere within this spatial region based on the cluster-wise test.\n\nThe discrepancy in outcomes is common: voxel-wise FWER tests are sensitive to focal, high-magnitude effects, while cluster-wise tests are sensitive to spatially extensive effects, which may have a lower peak magnitude. The observed result indicates an effect that is strong but not spatially widespread enough to pass the cluster-extent test.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. It is valid to conclude that the specific peak voxel is significant at image-wise FWER level $\\alpha$ for the voxel-wise family, but no inference about the spatial extent of the surrounding cluster is warranted.**\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with our analysis. The voxel-wise test was significant ($T_{\\text{peak}} = 5.2 > T_{0.95} = 5.1$), so the inference about the peak voxel is valid. The cluster-wise test was non-significant ($E_{\\text{obs}} = 140 < E_{0.95} = 160$), so no statistical inference can be made about the cluster's existence or extent. The inference from the voxel-wise test is specific to that voxel and does not extend to the entire cluster.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because the cluster containing the peak did not survive cluster-extent correction, the peak-wise result is invalid due to circularity (double dipping), and no voxel-wise inference can be made.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The voxel-wise and cluster-wise tests are two separate statistical procedures. The validity of an FWER-corrected voxel-wise test does not depend on the outcome of a cluster-wise test. The term \"circularity\" or \"double dipping\" applies when data are used to select a feature (e.g., a voxel or ROI) and then tested without accounting for the selection process. The maximum statistic permutation test, by its very nature, *is* the correction for this selection process (searching for the highest peak over all voxels). Therefore, the peak-wise result is indeed valid and not circular.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. It is valid to claim that all voxels in the non-significant cluster are activated, because at least one peak within it passes image-wise FWER correction.**\nThis statement represents a gross over-interpretation. A significant voxel-wise result provides evidence for an effect *only at that specific voxel*. It provides no statistical warrant for claiming that adjacent voxels are also active. Even if the *cluster* had been significant, the inference would only be that *at least one* voxel within the cluster is active (an inference on the region), not that *all* of them are.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. It is valid to report the significant peak and to describe the non-significant cluster’s extent and mean as exploratory, without inferential claims; labeling the cluster “trend-level” would be inappropriate in the absence of a pre-registered threshold and multiplicity control.**\nThis statement accurately describes best practices in scientific reporting. The significant peak is a valid inferential finding and should be reported. The cluster, although not statistically significant, is a feature of the observed data. Reporting its descriptive statistics (e.g., its extent of $140$ voxels, its location, its mean statistic) is transparent and informative, as long as it is clearly labeled as a non-significant, exploratory finding. The admonition against using ambiguous terms like “trend-level” is also correct; such language obscures the binary outcome of the hypothesis test ($p > 0.05$) and is poor practice unless a specific alpha-level for \"trends\" was pre-specified and appropriately controlled for.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. To preserve nominal image-wise FWER for the voxel-wise inference, the voxel-wise $p$-value must be further Bonferroni-corrected by a factor of $2$ for having also attempted cluster-wise inference on the same map.**\nThis statement incorrectly assesses the situation. The problem describes the control of FWER for two *distinct families* of hypotheses. The voxel-wise permutation test controls FWER at $\\alpha = 0.05$ across the family of all voxels. The cluster-wise permutation test controls FWER at $\\alpha = 0.05$ across the family of all clusters. Each is internally valid. If the researcher wished to control the FWER across the *union* of both families (i.e., protect against any false positive of either type), then a correction for the two tests would be required (e.g., setting the alpha for each to $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$). However, the voxel-wise inference, as conducted, *does* preserve its nominal image-wise FWER for its family. The statement implies the procedure as performed is invalid, which is false. One can report the result of each FWER-corrected analysis separately.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. A non-significant cluster provides evidence that there is no effect anywhere within that cluster with probability at least $0.95$.**\nThis statement fundamentally misinterprets frequentist hypothesis testing. Failing to reject the null hypothesis (i.e., a non-significant result) is not evidence for the null hypothesis. It is an \"absence of evidence,\" not \"evidence of absence.\" Furthermore, the specified probability of $0.95$ is a Bayesian-like statement about the probability of a hypothesis, which cannot be derived from a $p$-value. A $p$-value (here, $p > 0.05$) is $P(\\text{data}|\\text{H}_0)$, not $P(\\text{H}_0|\\text{data})$. The statement is further contradicted by the fact that we have positive, FWER-corrected evidence for an effect at the peak voxel, which lies within this very cluster.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
