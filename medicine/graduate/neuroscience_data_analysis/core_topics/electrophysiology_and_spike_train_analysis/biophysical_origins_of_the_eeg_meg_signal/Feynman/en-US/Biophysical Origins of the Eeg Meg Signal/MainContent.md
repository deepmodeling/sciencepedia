## Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are non-invasive windows into the living human brain, offering unparalleled temporal resolution of [neural dynamics](@entry_id:1128578). However, the signals they capture are the complex, spatially filtered result of the activity of millions of cells. A fundamental challenge for any neuroscientist is to understand the link between the microscopic world of neuronal currents and the macroscopic fields measured at the scalp. This article bridges that gap by systematically exploring the biophysical origins of the EEG and MEG signals. In the following sections, you will first uncover the core "Principles and Mechanisms," tracing the signal from the [postsynaptic potential](@entry_id:148693) of a single neuron to the concept of the current dipole and the effects of volume conduction. Next, in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," you will see how these physical laws provide a framework for clinical diagnosis in [neurology](@entry_id:898663) and create bridges to other neuroimaging methods like fMRI. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer the chance to solidify these concepts through practical computational problems, transforming abstract theory into tangible understanding.

## Principles and Mechanisms

To understand what Electroencephalography (EEG) and Magnetoencephalography (MEG) are telling us, we must embark on a journey that begins with a single neuron and ends with sensors outside the skull. It is a story of electricity, geometry, and the beautiful, simplifying laws of physics. We must trace the path of unimaginably tiny currents as they flow from their microscopic origins, navigate the labyrinthine tissues of the head, and ultimately generate the macroscopic fields we can measure.

### The True Engines of the Signal: Slow Potentials, Not Spikes

The brain is an electrical organ. Its currency is the flow of ions—charged atoms like sodium, potassium, and chloride—across the thin membranes of its countless nerve cells, or neurons. This electrical activity manifests in two principal forms: the famous **action potential**, or "spike," and the more subtle **[postsynaptic potential](@entry_id:148693)** (PSP).

One might naively guess that spikes, being the dramatic, all-or-nothing signals that neurons use to communicate over long distances, would be the main drivers of EEG and MEG. But this turns out to be wrong. The truth, which is far more elegant, is that the slow, graded ripples of PSPs are the true source. Why is this? The answer lies in the different characters of these two events, a difference in both time and space.

An action potential is a fleeting event, lasting only a millisecond or two. It involves a rapid inflow of positive ions followed almost immediately by an outflow, all happening in a very small patch of the neuron's membrane. From a distance, this looks like a positive current appearing and then a negative current appearing right next to it, almost simultaneously. Physicists call this arrangement a **quadrupole**. The fields from the two opposing poles of a [quadrupole](@entry_id:1130364) cancel each other out extremely effectively, decaying with distance so rapidly that they are virtually invisible to sensors placed on the scalp. It's like a tiny, brief flash of light that is over before you can see it and too weak to reach your eyes.

A [postsynaptic potential](@entry_id:148693), on the other hand, is a much more leisurely affair. It arises when one neuron releases neurotransmitters onto another, causing ion channels to open on the receiving neuron's dendrites. The resulting ion flow lasts for tens of milliseconds. Crucially, this current enters the neuron at one location (the synapse on a dendrite) but the return current exits the cell at a different, often distant, location (like the cell body, or soma). This separation of a [current source](@entry_id:275668) from a current sink over a significant distance creates what is known as a **current dipole**. Unlike a quadrupole, the field from a dipole decays much more slowly with distance. It is this lingering, spatially separated flow of charge that creates a signal strong enough to survive the journey to the scalp. A quantitative comparison reveals that the integrated effect of a typical synaptic event can be thousands of times more powerful in generating a [far-field](@entry_id:269288) signal than that of a spike .

### A Tale of Two Currents: Primary and Volume

To build a physical model, we must make a crucial distinction between two types of current . The first is the **[impressed current density](@entry_id:750574)**, or **primary current** ($\mathbf{J}_p$). This is the current that is actively driven by the neuron's own biological machinery. Think of it as the engine. It's the flow of ions pushed through channels and pumps across the cell membrane, a process that doesn't obey the simple Ohm's law of the surrounding medium. This primary current is confined within the neurons themselves.

However, current must flow in a closed loop. When ions are pushed out of the neuron at one point (a source), they must find a path to re-enter it at another (a sink). This return path lies in the extracellular fluid and other tissues of the head, which are conductive, much like salt water. The flow of current through this external medium is called the **[volume current density](@entry_id:268648)**, or **secondary current** ($\mathbf{J}_v$). This current is passive; it's simply the response of the conductive medium to the electric fields set up by the primary currents. It follows Ohm's law: $\mathbf{J}_v = \sigma \mathbf{E}$, where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field and $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the tissue.

The fundamental law of **[charge conservation](@entry_id:151839)** ties these two currents together. In the quasi-static regime (which we'll discuss shortly), the total current must be divergence-free: $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{J}_p + \mathbf{J}_v) = 0$. This simple equation holds a profound meaning: any primary current emerging from a neuron must be perfectly balanced by volume current flowing away from it. The primary currents are the sources, and the volume currents are the fields that spread throughout the entire head to ensure the books of charge are always balanced.

The elongated, branching structure of a cortical pyramidal neuron makes it an ideal generator for a primary current dipole. Synaptic input, for example at the distal apical dendrites, causes an inward flow of positive charge (a current sink). This charge flows down the long trunk of the dendrite as a primary current, and eventually flows back out into the extracellular space near the soma (a current source). This separation of source and sink, perhaps over hundreds of micrometers, creates a surprisingly robust current dipole .

### From One to Many: The Power of Alignment

A single neuron's dipole is still far too weak to be detected outside the head. The magic of EEG and MEG arises from the synchronous activity of many thousands, or even millions, of neurons. But even this is not enough. For their signals to add up, they must also be geometrically aligned. This leads to the concept of **open-field** versus **closed-field** geometries .

The cerebral cortex has a remarkable anatomical feature: its principal neurons, the pyramidal cells, are largely arranged in parallel columns, with their long apical dendrites oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. When a patch of cortex receives a synchronous synaptic input, these parallel neurons generate an array of parallel current dipoles. Their individual fields sum constructively, creating a macroscopic net dipole whose strength scales linearly with the number of active neurons. This coherent summation is the signature of an open-field arrangement, and it is the primary reason why we can measure cortical activity from the scalp.

In contrast, other brain structures, like the thalamus or certain types of interneurons, have a more radial or star-like arrangement. If these cells are activated together, their dipole moments point in all different directions. From a distance, their fields largely cancel each other out. This is a closed-field arrangement. The net signal is negligible, making such structures largely invisible to EEG and MEG.

### The Medium is the Message: Navigating the Head's Interior

The currents do not travel through a vacuum. The head is a complex volume conductor, a patchwork of tissues with vastly different electrical properties. The brain and scalp are moderately conductive, but the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that bathes the brain is a highly conductive saline solution. The skull, in stark contrast, is a poor conductor, acting as a major electrical insulator .

Furthermore, some tissues are **anisotropic**: their conductivity depends on the direction of current flow. In cerebral white matter, for instance, current flows much more easily along the direction of the [myelinated axon](@entry_id:192702) bundles than across them. This means that a proper description requires conductivity to be a tensor, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, not just a simple scalar .

This complex environment might seem hopelessly complicated to model, but physicists have a powerful simplifying tool: the **[quasi-static approximation](@entry_id:167818)**. Brain signals are slow, with frequencies below about $1000$ Hz. At these low frequencies, we can make two critical simplifications, both rigorously justifiable . First, the so-called **displacement current** ($\epsilon \partial \mathbf{E}/ \partial t$), which is related to the build-up of electric fields in a dielectric, is minuscule compared to the Ohmic [conduction current](@entry_id:265343) ($\sigma \mathbf{E}$). A careful calculation using realistic brain tissue properties shows this ratio is less than $0.07$ even at $1000$ Hz  . Second, inductive effects and wave propagation are negligible because the wavelength of the fields is meters long, far larger than the size of the head.

The quasi-static approximation means we can treat the problem as one of electrostatics and [magnetostatics](@entry_id:140120), where the fields throughout the head respond *instantaneously* to the changes in the neural sources. This is an immense simplification that makes the forward problem—calculating the fields from the sources—tractable.

### Two Windows on the Brain: EEG vs. MEG

EEG and MEG are born from the very same primary currents, yet they provide beautifully complementary views of brain activity. This difference arises directly from the fundamental laws of electromagnetism.

**EEG measures the electric [potential difference](@entry_id:275724)** between points on the scalp. This potential field, $V$, is a direct consequence of the volume currents, $\mathbf{J}_v$, flowing through the resistive tissues of the head. It is governed by Poisson's equation, $\nabla \cdot (\sigma \nabla V) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p$. The low conductivity of the skull acts like a resistive barrier that smears and attenuates the potential distribution before it reaches the scalp electrodes. This makes it challenging for EEG to precisely localize the underlying sources.

**MEG measures the magnetic field** outside the head. According to the Biot-Savart law, magnetic fields are generated by *all* currents, both primary ($\mathbf{J}_p$) and volume ($\mathbf{J}_v$). Here, however, nature provides a remarkable gift. For a conductor with [spherical symmetry](@entry_id:272852) (a good first approximation for the head), a profound physical theorem states that the volume currents produce exactly **zero** magnetic field outside the sphere  . This means that MEG is, to a first approximation, blind to the volume currents and sees only the primary currents flowing within the neurons. The magnetic fields pass almost unaffected through the skull and scalp, as these tissues have the same magnetic permeability as free space. This makes MEG less susceptible to the smearing effect of the skull and generally better for source localization.

This leads to the most famous distinction between the two modalities: their differential sensitivity to source orientation .
- **EEG** measures a [scalar potential](@entry_id:276177). It is sensitive to both the component of the primary current dipole that is oriented radially (perpendicular to the skull) and the component that is oriented tangentially (parallel to the skull).
- **MEG**, on the other hand, is governed by a cross product in the Biot-Savart law. A direct consequence of this is that a current dipole oriented purely radially produces no magnetic field outside a spherical conductor. It is "MEG-silent." MEG is therefore only sensitive to the tangential components of the primary current dipoles.

This means that neural activity in the walls of cortical folds (the gyri), which produces tangentially oriented dipoles, is readily detected by MEG. Activity deep within the crevices (the sulci), which can produce radially oriented dipoles, may be more easily seen by EEG. They are not redundant windows, but two different perspectives on the same underlying neural symphony. From near and far, the picture also changes. Intracranial recordings like the **Local Field Potential (LFP)** capture the rich, complex [near-field](@entry_id:269780) of neural sources, which decays slowly ($1/r$). EEG and MEG, as [far-field](@entry_id:269288) measurements, are sensitive to the simpler, dipolar part of the field, which decays faster ($1/r^2$) and reflects the spatially averaged, coherent activity of large neural populations .
