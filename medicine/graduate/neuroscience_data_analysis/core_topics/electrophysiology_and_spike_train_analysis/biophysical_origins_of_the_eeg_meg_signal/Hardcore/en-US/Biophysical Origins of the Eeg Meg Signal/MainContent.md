## Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are indispensable tools in modern neuroscience, offering non-invasive windows into the brain's electrical activity with millisecond precision. However, the signals measured at the scalp are the final product of a complex chain of biophysical events spanning multiple scales, from the microscopic flow of ions across a single neuron's membrane to the macroscopic fields that propagate through the head. A deep understanding of these underlying physical principles is not merely an academic exercise; it is the essential foundation for accurately interpreting brain signals, designing robust experiments, and developing sophisticated source localization techniques. This article bridges the gap between the cell and the sensor, elucidating the biophysical journey of a neural signal.

First, the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter will dissect the fundamental physics, starting from Maxwell's equations and the [quasi-static approximation](@entry_id:167818), to explain how synaptic activity generates primary current dipoles and how volume conduction shapes the resulting fields. Next, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate how these principles are crucial for clinical neurology, [multimodal imaging](@entry_id:925780) studies with fMRI, and computational modeling. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides an opportunity to explore key concepts like [signal filtering](@entry_id:142467), SNR differences, and source cancellation through guided computational exercises. We begin by establishing the core biophysical and electromagnetic principles that govern the generation of EEG and MEG signals.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) provide macroscopic windows into neural [population dynamics](@entry_id:136352), yet their signals originate from microscopic electrochemical events at the cellular level. Understanding the chain of physical principles that links these scales is paramount for the correct interpretation and modeling of non-invasive brain data. This chapter elucidates the fundamental biophysical mechanisms governing the generation of EEG and MEG signals, from the ion channels of a single neuron to the fields measured at the scalp.

### The Quasi-Static Approximation in Bioelectromagnetism

The generation and propagation of electromagnetic fields are governed by Maxwell's equations. However, for the frequencies relevant to neurophysiology (typically below $1$ kHz), these equations can be considerably simplified under the **quasi-static approximation**. This approximation rests on two key conditions: the negligibility of displacement currents relative to conduction currents, and the negligibility of inductive effects.

The total current density in a medium is the sum of the [conduction current](@entry_id:265343), $\mathbf{J}_c = \sigma \mathbf{E}$, and the displacement current, $\mathbf{J}_d = \epsilon \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}$, where $\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity, $\epsilon$ is the electric permittivity, and $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field. For a time-harmonic field with [angular frequency](@entry_id:274516) $\omega = 2\pi f$, the ratio of the magnitudes of these currents is given by $\frac{|\mathbf{J}_d|}{|\mathbf{J}_c|} = \frac{\omega \epsilon}{\sigma}$.

Biological tissues exhibit a very high [relative permittivity](@entry_id:267815) at low frequencies due to phenomena like [cell membrane capacitance](@entry_id:167236) and ion polarization (a phenomenon known as $\alpha$-dispersion). For instance, in [gray matter](@entry_id:912560), the [relative permittivity](@entry_id:267815) $\epsilon_r$ can be as high as $3.0 \times 10^7$ at $1$ Hz, decreasing to approximately $3.5 \times 10^5$ at $1000$ Hz. Despite these large values, the tissue's conductivity (for [gray matter](@entry_id:912560), $\sigma \approx 0.3$ S/m) is sufficiently high that conduction currents dominate. A quantitative analysis reveals that even at the upper end of the typical MEG band ($1000$ Hz), this ratio remains small :
$$ \frac{| \mathbf{J}_d |}{| \mathbf{J}_c |} \approx \frac{2\pi(1000 \, \text{Hz})(3.5 \times 10^5)(8.854 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m})}{0.3 \, \text{S/m}} \approx 0.065 \ll 1 $$
At lower frequencies, this ratio is even smaller. Consequently, we can safely neglect the displacement current term in Ampère's law, which simplifies to $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} \approx \mu_0 \mathbf{J}_c$, where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space .

The second condition of the quasi-static approximation involves Faraday's law of induction, $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = - \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}$. Inductive effects can be neglected if the characteristic length scale of the system (i.e., the size of the head, $L \approx 0.1$ m) is much smaller than the electromagnetic [skin depth](@entry_id:270307) $\delta = \sqrt{2 / (\omega \mu \sigma)}$ in the tissue. For brain tissue at $1000$ Hz, the skin depth is on the order of tens of meters. Since $L \ll \delta$, the induced electric fields are negligible compared to the primary electrostatic fields. This validates the approximation $\nabla \times \mathbf{E} \approx \mathbf{0}$, which is a crucial step as it allows the electric field to be expressed as the gradient of a [scalar potential](@entry_id:276177), $\mathbf{E} = -\nabla V$.

### Primary and Secondary Currents: The Engine of the Signal

Within the quasi-static framework, the total current density $\mathbf{J}$ in the head is conceptually partitioned into two components: the **primary current density** $\mathbf{J}_p$ (also called the impressed current) and the **secondary current density** $\mathbf{J}_v$ (also called the volume or return current) .

The **primary current**, $\mathbf{J}_p$, represents the active flow of ions across cell membranes, driven by electrochemical gradients established by [ion pumps](@entry_id:168855) and channels. This is the biophysical "engine" of the EEG and MEG signal. Crucially, $\mathbf{J}_p$ is confined to the interior of neurons and is not governed by the macroscopic Ohm's law of the surrounding tissue. Its dynamics are determined by the complex molecular machinery of [synaptic transmission](@entry_id:142801) and [neuronal integration](@entry_id:170464).

The **secondary current**, $\mathbf{J}_v$, is the passive, Ohmic flow of charge through the conductive extracellular and intracellular medium. It arises in response to the electric field set up by the primary currents. It is defined by the macroscopic Ohm's law, $\mathbf{J}_v = \sigma(\mathbf{r}) \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r})$, where $\sigma(\mathbf{r})$ is the conductivity of the tissue at position $\mathbf{r}$. These currents are often called "return currents" because they serve to close the electrical circuit established by the primary currents.

The principle of charge conservation requires the total current density to be [divergence-free](@entry_id:190991), $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = 0$. Substituting the partitioned currents and the definitions of $\mathbf{J}_v$ and $\mathbf{E}$, we arrive at a fundamental governing equation for the extracellular potential $V$:
$$ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{J}_p + \mathbf{J}_v) = \nabla \cdot (\mathbf{J}_p + \sigma(-\nabla V)) = 0 $$
This yields what is effectively Poisson's equation for the electric potential:
$$ \nabla \cdot (\sigma \nabla V) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p $$
This equation elegantly states that the source of the extracellular potential field is the divergence of the primary current density. Wherever primary current flows out of a neuron into the extracellular space (a "source"), $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p > 0$. Wherever it flows back into a neuron (a "sink"), $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p  0$. The secondary currents $\mathbf{J}_v$ then flow passively through the resistive head tissues from these sources to these sinks, establishing the potential distribution $V$ throughout the head, which is measured by EEG at the scalp.

### The Cellular Origin: Postsynaptic Potentials and the Current Dipole

While any transmembrane current contributes to $\mathbf{J}_p$, not all neural events are equally visible to EEG and MEG. The dominant source of the measurable signals are **[postsynaptic potentials](@entry_id:177286) (PSPs)**, not the more conspicuous action potentials (APs) . This can be understood by considering three factors: duration, spatial extent, and symmetry.

1.  **Duration:** PSPs are slow events, lasting tens to hundreds of milliseconds. APs are extremely brief, typically lasting only $1$-$2$ ms. For low-frequency signals ($ 100$ Hz), the contribution of a transient event scales with its time integral. The longer duration of PSPs means they transfer more charge per event, leading to a much larger integrated effect.

2.  **Spatial Extent:** Excitatory PSPs often occur on the distal dendrites of [pyramidal neurons](@entry_id:922580). The inward positive current at the synapse (sink) and the corresponding outward return current at the soma (source) are separated by a significant distance (hundreds of microns). This separation creates an effective **current dipole**.

3.  **Symmetry:** During an AP, the inward (depolarizing) and outward (repolarizing) currents occur in close spatial proximity along the axon. This configuration resembles a [quadrupole](@entry_id:1130364), whose electric and magnetic fields decay much more rapidly with distance than those of a dipole. The fields from the opposing currents of an AP largely cancel each other out when viewed from afar.

A quantitative comparison illustrates this starkly. Consider a scenario with synchronous activation of $10^4$ synapses versus $100$ synchronous spikes. Despite the larger current per spike, the combination of the longer PSP duration ($\tau_{\text{psc}} \approx 20$ ms vs. $\tau_{\text{sp}} \approx 1$ ms), the greater source-sink separation ($d_{\text{psc}} \approx 0.5$ mm vs. $d_{\text{sp}} \approx 30$ µm), and the severe cancellation of the spike's field (a reduction factor of ~99%) results in the integrated dipole moment from PSPs being several orders of magnitude larger than that from spikes. This demonstrates why EEG and MEG are primarily sensitive to the summed synaptic activity of a neural population rather than its spiking output .

The **current dipole moment**, $\mathbf{p}$, is the fundamental quantity that describes the neural source in the far-field. It is the first non-vanishing term in the [multipole expansion](@entry_id:144850) of the [primary current distribution](@entry_id:260593) $\mathbf{J}_p$. For a current $I$ flowing between a source and a sink separated by a vector $\mathbf{d}$, the dipole moment is $\mathbf{p} = I \mathbf{d}$. For a single pyramidal neuron receiving synaptic input, we can estimate this value. For instance, a uniform synaptic barrage on the distal apical branches of a layer V pyramidal neuron can produce a total inward current. If this synaptic sink is centered, say, at $z = 700 \, \mu\text{m}$ and the return current source is at the soma ($z=0$), the resulting separation is $d=700 \, \mu\text{m}$. A plausible synaptic input might generate a total current of about $44$ pA, yielding a dipole moment magnitude of $p = I \cdot d \approx (44 \times 10^{-12} \text{A}) \cdot (700 \times 10^{-6} \text{m}) \approx 0.0308$ pA·m .

### Summation and Cancellation: The Role of Cortical Architecture

The dipole moment from a single neuron is far too small to be detected outside the head. Measurable EEG and MEG signals rely on the constructive summation of activity from large, synchronized populations of neurons, typically involving tens of thousands to millions of cells. The anatomical organization of these neurons is therefore critical. This gives rise to the distinction between **open-field** and **closed-field** geometries .

An **open-field** configuration is one where current sources are arranged such that their individual fields sum constructively at a distance. The quintessential example is the laminar organization of the [cerebral cortex](@entry_id:910116), where the large pyramidal neurons are aligned in parallel, with their long apical dendrites oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. When a population of these neurons receives synchronous synaptic input, their individual current dipoles are co-oriented. The net mesoscopic dipole moment $\mathbf{P}$ is the vector sum of the individual moments, $\mathbf{P} = \sum_i \mathbf{p}_i$. For aligned neurons, this summation is coherent, and the expected magnitude of the net dipole scales linearly with the number of active neurons, $N$.

In contrast, a **closed-field** configuration features a high degree of symmetry in the arrangement of neurons, causing their fields to cancel when viewed from a distance. Thalamic nuclei, where neurons project radially outwards from a central point, are a classic example. The vector sum of their dipole moments tends towards zero, resulting in a weak or non-existent far-field signal.

This principle explains why the pyramidal cells of the cortex, with their distinct open-field geometry and long apical dendrites that support strong current dipoles, are considered the primary generators of both EEG and MEG signals.

### The Forward Problem: From Cerebral Source to Scalp Sensor

The "[forward problem](@entry_id:749531)" in EEG/MEG is to calculate the electric potentials and magnetic fields at the sensor locations, given a specific neural [current source](@entry_id:275668) distribution and a model of the head's conductive properties.

#### Volume Conduction and Head Models

The path from source to sensor is not empty space; it is a complex volume conductor comprising tissues with vastly different electrical properties. The most accurate models must account for this inhomogeneity and anisotropy . Tissue conductivity is formally described by a **conductivity tensor**, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}$, which relates the electric field to the current density: $\mathbf{J}_v = \boldsymbol{\sigma}\mathbf{E}$.
*   **Isotropic media** have conductivity that is independent of direction, so $\boldsymbol{\sigma} = \sigma\mathbf{I}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), being a saline solution, is a good example of a highly conductive ($\sigma_{\text{CSF}} \approx 1.8$ S/m) isotropic medium.
*   **Anisotropic media** have direction-dependent conductivity. Cerebral white matter is a prime example; current flows more easily along [myelinated axon](@entry_id:192702) bundles than across them. Its [conductivity tensor](@entry_id:155827) has a principal axis aligned with the fiber tracts. The skull bone is also known to be anisotropic, with conductivity in the tangential direction being several times higher than in the radial direction due to its layered microstructure.

#### EEG: The Smearing Effect of the Skull

The EEG measures the electric [potential difference](@entry_id:275724) between electrodes on the scalp. As established, the potential field $V$ is governed by $\nabla \cdot (\boldsymbol{\sigma} \nabla V) = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{J}_p$. The solution for $V$ is profoundly affected by the [spatial distribution](@entry_id:188271) of conductivity, $\boldsymbol{\sigma}(\mathbf{r})$. The skull, in particular, plays a dominant role. Its conductivity is very low (about 1/80th that of the brain). This highly resistive layer has two major consequences for the EEG signal :
1.  **Attenuation:** It impedes the flow of volume currents from the brain to the scalp. To maintain current continuity across the brain-skull boundary, a large portion of the potential generated by the neural source is dropped across this high-resistance layer, significantly reducing the potential variations that can be measured at the scalp.
2.  **Smearing:** The resistive skull forces the volume currents to spread out tangentially before they reach the scalp, effectively blurring the potential distribution. This spatial low-pass filtering limits the spatial resolution of EEG.

#### MEG: Transparency to the Skull

The MEG measures the weak magnetic fields outside the head produced by the total current density $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{J}_p + \mathbf{J}_v$. A remarkable result of [biomagnetism](@entry_id:260845) states that for a **spherically symmetric conductor** (a simplified head model consisting of concentric shells of isotropic conductivity), the secondary (volume) currents $\mathbf{J}_v$ produce exactly zero magnetic field outside the conductor  . In this idealized but powerful model, the external magnetic field is generated *only* by the primary currents $\mathbf{J}_p$.

Since magnetic fields are not significantly affected by the non-magnetic tissues of the head, they pass through the skull nearly undisturbed. This means MEG is largely insensitive to the uncertainties and complexities of skull conductivity that so profoundly affect EEG. While this perfect independence from volume currents breaks down in realistic, non-spherically shaped heads, the influence of conductivity inhomogeneities remains much weaker for MEG than for EEG.

#### Near-Field vs. Far-Field

The nature of the measured signal also depends critically on the distance from the source .
*   **Local Field Potential (LFP)**, measured with intracranial electrodes, is a **[near-field](@entry_id:269780)** measurement. The potential is a weighted sum of nearby current [sources and sinks](@entry_id:263105), with a weighting kernel that decays as $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance to the source. It reflects highly localized neural activity within a small volume (a few cubic millimeters).
*   **EEG and MEG**, measured at the scalp, are **far-field** measurements. At this distance, the details of the source configuration are lost, and the field is dominated by the leading term of the [multipole expansion](@entry_id:144850): the current dipole. Both the electric potential and the magnetic field magnitude from a dipole decay as $1/r^2$. These signals therefore reflect the net dipole moment of large, synchronously active cortical patches, preferentially summing the contributions of long, coherently oriented dendritic currents.

### Complementarity: The Role of Source Orientation

A final, crucial distinction between EEG and MEG lies in their differential sensitivity to the orientation of the current [dipole source](@entry_id:1123789) . This difference makes the two modalities complementary rather than redundant.

The magnetic field produced by a current dipole $\mathbf{p}$ at a position $\mathbf{r}$ (relative to the dipole) is given by the Biot-Savart law, which involves a cross product: $\mathbf{B} \propto \mathbf{p} \times \mathbf{r}$. If the dipole is oriented radially from the center of a spherical head model (i.e., $\mathbf{p}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{r}$), the [cross product](@entry_id:156749) is zero. Thus, **MEG is blind to purely radial sources**. It is maximally sensitive to sources oriented tangentially to the scalp surface. Cortical activity in the gyral crowns produces primarily tangential dipoles, which are strong in MEG.

In contrast, the electric potential is given by a formula involving a dot product: $V \propto \mathbf{p} \cdot \mathbf{r}$. This potential is non-zero for any dipole orientation except one that is perfectly perpendicular to the measurement direction. An electrode placed on the scalp directly above a radial source will measure a maximal potential. Therefore, **EEG is sensitive to both radial and tangential sources**. Cortical activity deep within the sulci often produces dipoles with a predominantly radial orientation. These "radially-oriented" sources are clearly visible to EEG but may be weak or entirely absent in MEG recordings.

In summary, the biophysical signals measured by EEG and MEG are the macroscopic result of synchronous postsynaptic activity in large populations of aligned pyramidal neurons. While both reflect the same underlying neural current dipoles, their paths to the sensors are shaped by different physical principles. EEG is sensitive to the electric potential, heavily filtered and attenuated by the resistive skull, but capable of detecting both radial and tangential sources. MEG is sensitive to the magnetic field, which passes through the skull largely unimpeded but is blind to purely radial sources. A comprehensive understanding of these principles is the bedrock upon which all advanced methods of neural [source reconstruction](@entry_id:1131995) are built.
