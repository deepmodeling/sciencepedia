            "solution": "We begin from core definitions relevant to statistical association analysis in neuroscience data. The Pearson correlation coefficient between two real-valued variables $X$ and $Y$ is defined as\n$$\n\\rho_{P}(X,Y) = \\frac{\\operatorname{cov}(X,Y)}{\\sigma_{X}\\,\\sigma_{Y}} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])(Y - \\mathbb{E}[Y])\\right]}{\\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(X - \\mathbb{E}[X])^{2}\\right]} \\sqrt{\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[(Y - \\mathbb{E}[Y])^{2}\\right]}}.\n$$\nIn the finite-sample case with observed pairs $\\{(x_{i},y_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, the sample Pearson correlation $r_{P}$ replaces expectations with empirical averages. Pearson correlation quantifies linear association: it equals $1$ if and only if there exist constants $a0$ and $b$ such that $y_{i} = a x_{i} + b$ for all $i$.\n\nThe Spearman rank correlation coefficient, denoted $\\rho_{s}$, is defined as the Pearson correlation of the ranks of the variables. Let $R_{X,i}$ be the rank of $x_{i}$ among $\\{x_{1},\\dots,x_{n}\\}$, and $R_{Y,i}$ be the rank of $y_{i}$ among $\\{y_{1},\\dots,y_{n}\\}$. Then\n$$\n\\rho_{s}(X,Y) = \\rho_{P}(R_{X}, R_{Y}).\n$$\nWhen there are no ties and the mapping $y = f(x)$ is strictly monotonic increasing, the ranks are identical for all pairs, $R_{Y,i} = R_{X,i}$ for all $i$, and hence $\\rho_{s} = 1$ exactly.\n\nWe now apply these definitions to the given dataset. The stimulus intensities are $s \\in \\{\\,0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\,\\}$ and the firing rates are $r \\in \\left\\{\\,0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\}$. The response function $r(s) = \\frac{s}{1+s}$ (here $r_{\\max} = 1$ and $K = 1$) is strictly increasing for all $s \\ge 0$, because its derivative is\n$$\n\\frac{d}{ds}\\left(\\frac{s}{1+s}\\right) = \\frac{1}{(1+s)^{2}}  0.\n$$\nTherefore, ordering by $s$ is identical to ordering by $r$. Explicitly, the rank order of $s$ is\n$$\ns: \\quad 0 \\prec 1 \\prec 2 \\prec 3 \\prec 4 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_{S} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5),\n$$\nand the rank order of $r$ is\n$$\nr: \\quad 0 \\prec \\frac{1}{2} \\prec \\frac{2}{3} \\prec \\frac{3}{4} \\prec \\frac{4}{5} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R_{R} = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).\n$$\nThere are no ties. Hence $R_{R,i} = R_{S,i}$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$, and the Spearman rank correlation is\n$$\n\\rho_{s} = \\rho_{P}(R_{S}, R_{R}) = \\rho_{P}(R_{S}, R_{S}) = 1.\n$$\n\nTo illuminate why Pearson correlation underestimates association strength here, we compute the sample Pearson correlation for these specific values to show it is strictly less than $1$. Let $n = 5$, $x_{i} \\equiv s_{i} \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, and $y_{i} \\equiv r_{i} \\in \\left\\{0, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{3}, \\frac{3}{4}, \\frac{4}{5}\\right\\}$. The sample means are\n$$\n\\bar{x} = \\frac{0+1+2+3+4}{5} = 2, \\qquad \\bar{y} = \\frac{0 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{4}{5}}{5} = \\frac{163}{300}.\n$$\nThe sample covariance numerator is\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})(y_{i}-\\bar{y}) = \\frac{37}{20}.\n$$\nThe sample variance sums are\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5}(x_{i}-\\bar{x})^{2} = 10, \\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^{5}(y_{i}-\\bar{y})^{2} = \\frac{947}{2250}.\n$$\nThus, the sample Pearson correlation is\n$$\nr_{P} = \\frac{\\frac{37}{20}}{\\sqrt{10}\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{947}{2250}}} \\approx 0.9012,\n$$\nwhich is less than $1$, despite the underlying dependence being perfectly monotonic. The reason is that Pearson correlation quantifies linear alignment; here the relationship $y = \\frac{x}{1+x}$ is concave and saturating: increments in $x$ at higher values yield diminishing increments in $y$, compressing variation in $y$ at the high end. This curvature reduces linear association even though the ordinal association is perfect. In contrast, Spearman rank correlation ignores the specific nonlinearity and uses ranks; because the mapping is strictly increasing with no ties, the rank order is identical, yielding $\\rho_{s} = 1$.\n\nTherefore, for this monotonic but saturating neural response, Spearman’s $\\rho_{s}$ captures the full association ($\\rho_{s} = 1$), while Pearson correlation underestimates it (here $r_{P} \\approx 0.9012$).",

The investigator will report uncertainty using a two-sided confidence interval constructed by applying the Fisher hyperbolic arctangent transform to the sample Pearson correlation coefficient. The target design constraint is that the half-width (margin of error) of this Fisher transform-based interval should not exceed a specified value. The investigator is considering using either the Pearson correlation coefficient or the Spearman rank correlation coefficient (defined as the Pearson correlation of the ranks) in the analysis, and wants to understand how autocorrelation in the time series influences the needed sample size.\n\nAssume each BOLD time series is a stable first-order autoregressive process, with lag-1 autocorrelation coefficients $\\phi_{x}$ and $\\phi_{y}$, respectively. The time series are sampled every $\\mathrm{TR}$ seconds (repetition time), and the first $d$ seconds of data are discarded to allow for magnetization equilibrium.

Using only core definitions and well-tested large-sample distributional facts, derive from first principles the minimal number of usable time points (after discarding the first $d$ seconds) required to guarantee the margin of error condition under autocorrelation, and then map this requirement to a minimal total scan duration.\n\nConcretely, use the following scientifically plausible parameters for an adult resting-state acquisition:\n- Lag-1 autocorrelation coefficients: $\\phi_{x} = 0.60$ and $\\phi_{y} = 0.70$.\n- Repetition time: $\\mathrm{TR} = 0.80$ seconds.\n- Discarded initial time for equilibration: $d = 12$ seconds.\n- Confidence level: $0.95$.\n- Required margin of error on the Fisher transform scale: $m_{z} = 0.10$.\n\nCompute the minimal total scan duration $T_{\\mathrm{total}}$ in minutes that meets the margin of error requirement under these autocorrelation constraints, assuming the number of usable time points must be an integer and that the total duration includes the discarded $d$ seconds.

The analysis must account for the presence of autocorrelation in the time series. The solution proceeds by first deriving the required number of usable time points and then converting this to a total scan duration.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on the Fisher hyperbolic arctangent (z-) transform. Let $\\rho$ be the true Pearson correlation coefficient between two random variables, and let $r$ be the sample Pearson correlation coefficient calculated from a sample of size $n$. The Fisher transform of $r$ is given by:\n$$ z = \\mathrm{arctanh}(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln \\left( \\frac{1+r}{1-r} \\right) $$\nFor large samples drawn from a bivariate normal distribution, the distribution of $z$ is approximately normal with mean $\\mathrm{arctanh}(\\rho)$ and variance that depends on the sample size and the nature of the data.\n\nFor independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations, the standard error of $z$ is well-approximated by:\n$$ \\sigma_{z, \\text{iid}} \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n-3}} $$\nA two-sided confidence interval for $\\mathrm{arctanh}(\\rho)$ with confidence level $1-\\alpha$ is constructed as:\n$$ z \\pm Z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma_z $$\nwhere $Z_{\\alpha/2}$ is the critical value of the standard normal distribution that corresponds to an upper tail probability of $\\alpha/2$. The margin of error (or half-width) of this interval, on the transformed scale, is:\n$$ m_z = Z_{\\alpha/2} \\sigma_z $$\nThe problem specifies a confidence level of $0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $Z_{\\alpha/2} = Z_{0.025}$. The value of $Z_{0.025}$ is approximately $1.96$.\n\nHowever, BOLD fMRI time series are not i.i.d.; they exhibit significant temporal autocorrelation, which is modeled here as a first-order autoregressive, AR(1), process for each time series, $X_t$ and $Y_t$, with lag-$1$ autocorrelation coefficients $\\phi_x$ and $\\phi_y$. The presence of autocorrelation reduces the effective number of independent data points, thereby increasing the variance of the sample correlation coefficient $r$ and, consequently, the variance of its Fisher transform $z$.\n\nFor two stationary AR(1) time series with a true cross-correlation of $\\rho=0$, the large-sample variance of the sample correlation coefficient $r$ is given by a classic result from time series analysis:\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}(r) \\approx \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{1+\\phi_x\\phi_y}{1-\\phi_x\\phi_y} \\right) $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of time points. This approximation remains reasonably accurate for small $\\rho$. The Fisher transform is variance-stabilizing, so for small $r$, $\\mathrm{Var}(z) \\approx \\mathrm{Var}(r)$. We can thus model the effect of autocorrelation as an inflation of the variance compared to the i.i.d. case. We define an effective sample size, $n_{eff}$, such that the standard error in the autocorrelated case matches the form of the i.i.d. case:\n$$ \\sigma_z \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n_{eff}-3}} $$\nEquating the variances, we have $\\frac{1}{n_{eff}-3} \\approx \\frac{1}{n-3} \\left( \\frac{1+\\phi_x\\phi_y}{1-\\phi_x\\phi_y} \\right)$.
