This model operates on the core assumption that all studies in the analysis are estimating the same, single true effect size, $\\mu$. This exercise will guide you through deriving and calculating the pooled effect estimate, demonstrating how inverse-variance weighting emerges naturally from the principle of maximum likelihood to give more influence to more precise studies. Mastering this method provides the essential building blocks for all other meta-analytic techniques. ",

The analysis may now proceed.\n\n---\n\n### Derivations as Requested by the Task\n\n**1. Fixed-Effect Model Calculations**\n\nThe fixed-effect model assumes homogeneity of effects, i.e., $\\tau^2=0$. The weights are the inverse of the within-study variances, $w_i^{FE} = 1/v_i$.\n\n- $w_1^{FE} = 1/0.04 = 25$\n- $w_2^{FE} = 1/0.01 = 100$\n- $w_3^{FE} = 1/0.025 = 40$\n- $w_4^{FE} = 1/0.0225 = 1/(9/400) = 400/9 \\approx 44.44$\n\nThe sum of the weights is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i^{FE} = 25 + 100 + 40 + \\frac{400}{9} = 165 + \\frac{400}{9} = \\frac{1485 + 400}{9} = \\frac{1885}{9} \\approx 209.44 $$\n\nThe fixed-effect pooled estimate, $\\hat{\\mu}_{FE}$, is the weighted average of the study effects:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_{FE} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i^{FE} y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i^{FE}} $$\nThe numerator is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i^{FE} y_i = 25(0.20) + 100(0.18) + 40(0.22) + \\frac{400}{9}(0.19) = 5 + 18 + 8.8 + \\frac{76}{9} = 31.8 + \\frac{76}{9} = \\frac{286.2+76}{9} = \\frac{362.2}{9} \\approx 40.24 $$\nThus, the pooled estimate is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mu}_{FE} = \\frac{362.2/9}{1885/9} = \\frac{362.2}{1885} \\approx 0.192148 $$\n\nThe dispersion measure is Cochran's $Q$ statistic:\n$$ Q = \\sum_{i=1}^4 w_i^{FE} (y_i - \\hat{\\mu}_{FE})^2 $$\nUnder the null hypothesis of homogeneity ($\\tau^2=0$), $Q$ follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with $k-1$ degrees of freedom. Here, $k=4$, so the degrees of freedom are $3$. The expected value of $Q$ under homogeneity is $E[Q] = k-1 = 3$. An alternative formula for $Q$ is $Q=\\sum w_i^{FE}y_i^2 - (\\sum w_i^{FE}y_i)^2 / (\\sum w_i^{FE})$.\n$$ \\sum w_i^{FE}y_i^2 = 25(0.2^2) + 100(0.18^2) + 40(0.22^2) + \\frac{400}{9}(0.19^2) = 1 + 3.24 + 1.936 + 1.6044... = 7.7804... $$\n$$ Q = 7.7804... - \\frac{(40.244...)^2}{209.444...} = 7.7804... - \\frac{1619.60...}{209.444...} \\approx 7.7804 - 7.7329 = 0.0475 $$\nSince $Q \\approx 0.0475$ is much less than the degrees of freedom ($k-1=3$), the observed dispersion is smaller than expected due to sampling error alone.\n\n**2. DerSimonian-Laird (DL) Estimate for $\\tau^2$**\n\nThe DL estimate is derived by setting the observed $Q$ equal to its expectation under the random-effects model and solving for $\\tau^2$:\n$$ E[Q] = (k-1) + C \\tau^2 $$\nwhere $C = \\sum w_i^{FE} - \\frac{\\sum (w_i^{FE})^2}{\\sum w_i^{FE}}$.\nThe estimator is:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}^2_{DL} = \\frac{Q - (k-1)}{C} $$\nWe need to compute $C$:\n$$ \\sum (w_i^{FE})^2 = 25^2 + 100^2 + 40^2 + (400/9)^2 = 625 + 10000 + 1600 + 1975.31 \\approx 14200.31 $$\n$$ C \\approx 209.44 - \\frac{14200.31}{209.44} \\approx 209.44 - 67.80 = 141.64 $$\nNow, we compute $\\hat{\\tau}^2_{DL}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}^2_{DL} \\approx \\frac{0.0475 - 3}{141.64} = \\frac{-2.9525}{141.64} \\approx -0.0208 $$\nSince a variance cannot be negative, the DL estimate is truncated at zero:\n$$ \\hat{\\tau}^2 = \\max(0, \\hat{\\tau}^2_{DL}) = 0 $$\n\n**3. Pooled Estimate under the Truncated Model**\nWith $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = 0$, the random-effects model parameters are re-evaluated.\n- **Weights**: The random-effects weights are $w_i^{RE} = 1/(v_i + \\hat{\\tau}^2)$. With $\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$, the weights become $w_i^{RE} = 1/v_i$, which are identical to the fixed-effect weights $w_i^{FE}$.\n- **Pooled Estimate $\\hat{\\mu}$**: The random-effects pooled estimate is $\\hat{\\mu}_{RE} = \\frac{\\sum w_i^{RE}y_i}{\\sum w_i^{RE}}$. Since $w_i^{RE} = w_i^{FE}$, it follows that $\\hat{\\mu}_{RE} = \\hat{\\mu}_{FE} \\approx 0.192$.\n- **Standard Error**: The variance of the pooled estimate is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_{RE}) = 1 / (\\sum w_i^{RE})$. With $\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$, this becomes $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_{RE}) = 1 / (\\sum 1/v_i)$. This is identical to the variance of the fixed-effect estimate.\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}) = 1 / (\\sum w_i^{FE}) = 1 / (1885/9) = 9/1885 \\approx 0.00477 $$\nThe standard error is $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu}) = \\sqrt{9/1885} \\approx 0.0691$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ is truncated at $0$, the random-effects pooled estimate equals the fixed-effect pooled estimate, and the study weights equal $1/v_i$.**\nThis statement is correct. As derived above, when $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ is set to $0$, the random-effects model weights $w_i^{RE} = 1/(v_i + \\hat{\\tau}^2)$ simplify to $w_i^{RE} = 1/v_i$. These are, by definition, the fixed-effect model weights. Since both the formula for the pooled estimate and the weights themselves become identical, the random-effects pooled estimate $\\hat{\\mu}_{RE}$ will be numerically equal to the fixed-effect pooled estimate $\\hat{\\mu}_{FE}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Truncating $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ at $0$ changes Cochran’s $Q$ and increases the evidence of heterogeneity; consequently, the $I$-squared ($I^2$) statistic becomes strictly positive after truncation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Cochran's $Q$ statistic is calculated from the fixed-effect model and is an input to the formula for $\\hat{\\tau}^2$. The process of estimating or truncating $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ occurs *after* $Q$ has been computed; thus, it does not change $Q$. Truncation to $\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$ occurs precisely when $Q < k-1$, which indicates less variability than expected by chance, i.e., evidence for homogeneity, not increased heterogeneity. The $I^2$ statistic, which measures the percentage of variation across studies due to heterogeneity, is defined as $I^2 = \\frac{Q-(k-1)}{Q} \\times 100\\%$. If $Q < k-1$, $I^2$ is set to $0\\%$. In our case, $Q \\approx 0.0475 < 3$, so $I^2 = 0\\%$. It does not become strictly positive.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. With $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = 0$, the estimated variance of the pooled effect under the random-effects model equals $1/\\sum_i (1/v_i)$, and the corresponding $95\\%$ confidence interval coincides with the fixed-effect confidence interval.**\nThis statement is correct. The variance of the random-effects pooled mean is $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_{RE}) = 1/\\sum_i w_i^{RE} = 1/\\sum_i(1/(v_i + \\hat{\\tau}^2))$. When $\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$, this becomes $1/\\sum_i(1/v_i)$. This is precisely the formula for the variance of the fixed-effect pooled mean, $\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\mu}_{FE})$. A $95\\%$ confidence interval is calculated as $\\hat{\\mu} \\pm 1.96 \\times \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu})$. Since both the point estimate ($\\hat{\\mu}_{RE} = \\hat{\\mu}_{FE}$) and the standard error ($\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu}_{RE}) = \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu}_{FE})$) are identical for the two models when $\\hat{\\tau}^2 = 0$, their resulting confidence intervals will also be identical.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because truncation ignores uncertainty in $\\hat{\\tau}^2$, the usual normal-approximation $p$-value for the overall effect necessarily becomes larger (more conservative) than under the fixed-effect model.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The p-value for testing the null hypothesis $H_0: \\mu = 0$ is derived from the test statistic $z = \\hat{\\mu} / \\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu})$. As established in the analysis of options A and C, when $\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$, both $\\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\text{SE}(\\hat{\\mu})$ for the random-effects model are identical to their fixed-effect counterparts. Therefore, the test statistic $z$ and the resulting p-value will be exactly the same, not larger or more conservative. While the premise that truncation ignores uncertainty is a valid criticism of the standard procedure, the conclusion drawn for this specific case ($\\hat{\\tau}^2=0$) is false. In the general case where $\\hat{\\tau}^2 > 0$, the random-effects p-value is indeed larger than the fixed-effect p-value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Under likelihood-based estimation such as Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML), the estimate of $\\tau^2$ is constrained to be nonnegative; at the boundary $\\tau^2 = 0$ the sampling distribution is nonstandard, and Wald-type confidence intervals for $\\tau^2$ can have poor coverage near $0$.**\nThis statement is correct. It addresses the general implications of boundary estimates for $\\tau^2$, as prompted by the question.\n1. Likelihood-based methods like ML or REML maximize the likelihood function over the valid parameter space. Since $\\tau^2$ is a variance, its parameter space is $[0, \\infty)$, so the resulting estimate is constrained to be non-negative by the estimation procedure itself. This contrasts with the DL method-of-moments, which can yield negative estimates that require an ad-hoc truncation.\n2. When the true value of a parameter lies on the boundary of the parameter space (as $\\tau^2=0$ does), standard asymptotic theories for likelihood estimators fail. The asymptotic distribution of the likelihood ratio test statistic for $H_0: \\tau^2=0$ is a mixture of $\\chi^2$ distributions (a $50:50$ mixture of a point mass at $0$ and a $\\chi^2_1$ distribution), not a single $\\chi^2$ distribution. This is a nonstandard distribution.\n3. Wald-type confidence intervals rely on the assumption of asymptotic normality of the estimator. Since this assumption is violated for $\\hat{\\tau}^2$ near the boundary, Wald intervals perform poorly, exhibiting under-coverage and potentially yielding nonsensical negative limits.\nThis statement accurately describes known statistical properties of variance component estimation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
