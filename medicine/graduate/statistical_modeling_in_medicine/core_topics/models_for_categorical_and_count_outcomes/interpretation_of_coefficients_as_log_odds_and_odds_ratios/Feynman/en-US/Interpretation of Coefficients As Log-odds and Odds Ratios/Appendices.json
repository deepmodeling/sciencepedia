It is scientifically grounded in standard biostatistical methodology, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and stated objectively. The scenario is a realistic application of logistic regression in clinical research.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the baseline probability of $30$-day mortality for a specified reference patient and an explanation of the role of covariate centering in the interpretation of the intercept term, $\\beta_0$.\n\nThe logistic regression model provided is:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\\right) \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1\\big(\\text{Age}_i - 65\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_2\\big(\\text{Lactate}_i - 2\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_3\\big(\\text{CCI}_i - 3\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_4\\, I_{\\text{male},i} \\;+\\; \\beta_5\\big(\\text{Age}_i - 65\\big)\\big(\\text{Lactate}_i - 2\\big)\n$$\nThe left side of the equation, $\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_i}{1 - p_i}\\right)$, is the natural logarithm of the odds of mortality, also known as the log-odds or logit of $p_i$.\n\nThe reference patient is defined as a female patient with $\\text{Age}=65$, $\\text{Lactate}=2$ mmol/L, and a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) of $3$. For such a patient, the values of the covariates in the model are:\n*   $\\text{Age}_i = 65$, so the term $\\big(\\text{Age}_i - 65\\big) = 0$.\n*   $\\text{Lactate}_i = 2$, so the term $\\big(\\text{Lactate}_i - 2\\big) = 0$.\n*   $\\text{CCI}_i = 3$, so the term $\\big(\\text{CCI}_i - 3\\big) = 0$.\n*   The patient is female, so the indicator variable $I_{\\text{male},i} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the model equation for the reference patient (let's denote their mortality probability as $p_{\\text{ref}}$) yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{ref}}}{1 - p_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1\\big(65 - 65\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_2\\big(2 - 2\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_3\\big(3 - 3\\big) \\;+\\; \\beta_4(0) \\;+\\; \\beta_5\\big(65 - 65\\big)\\big(2 - 2\\big)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{ref}}}{1 - p_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\;=\\; \\beta_0 \\;+\\; \\beta_1(0) \\;+\\; \\beta_2(0) \\;+\\; \\beta_3(0) \\;+\\; 0 \\;+\\; \\beta_5(0)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{p_{\\text{ref}}}{1 - p_{\\text{ref}}}\\right) \\;=\\; \\beta_0\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the direct clinical relevance of centering the covariates. By centering the continuous predictors (Age, Lactate, CCI) at specific, medically meaningful values ($65$, $2$, and $3$, respectively) and selecting a reference level for categorical predictors (female, where $I_{\\text{male}} = 0$), the model is structured so that the intercept, $\\beta_0$, represents the log-odds of the outcome for this specific, clinically relevant \"reference patient\". Without centering, $\\beta_0$ would correspond to the log-odds for a patient with age $0$, lactate $0$, and CCI $0$, which is a biologically and clinically nonsensical extrapolation. Centering thus makes the baseline risk estimate, encoded by $\\beta_0$, directly interpretable for a typical or baseline patient profile. A secondary benefit is the reduction of multicollinearity between the main effects and the interaction term, improving the stability of the coefficient estimates.\n\nNow, we derive the probability $p_{\\text{ref}}$ from its log-odds.

First, we calculate the true number of infections prevented based on the correct interpretation of the logistic regression coefficient. Second, we calculate the number of infections that the committee *assumes* will be prevented by incorrectly using the odds ratio as a risk ratio. The difference between these two values is the required overestimation.\n\nLet $p_0$ be the risk of infection in the control group (standard care) and $p_1$ be the true risk of infection in the treated group. We are given $p_{0} = 0.30$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the true number of prevented infections**\n\nThe coefficient from the logistic regression, $\\beta_{1}$, is the natural logarithm of the odds ratio (OR).\n$$ \\beta_{1} = \\ln(\\text{OR}) $$\nGiven $\\beta_{1} = \\ln(0.60)$, we can find the odds ratio by exponentiating the coefficient:\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\exp(\\beta_{1}) = \\exp(\\ln(0.60)) = 0.60 $$\nThe odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of infection in the treated group ($\\text{Odds}_1$) to the odds of infection in the control group ($\\text{Odds}_0$).\n$$ \\text{OR} = \\frac{\\text{Odds}_1}{\\text{Odds}_0} $$\nThe odds for the control group are calculated from the baseline risk $p_0$ using the provided definition:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{0.30}{1-0.30} = \\frac{0.30}{0.70} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\nWe can now calculate the odds for the treated group:\n$$ \\text{Odds}_1 = \\text{OR} \\times \\text{Odds}_0 = 0.60 \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{3}{5} \\times \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{9}{35} $$\nTo find the true risk in the treated group, $p_1$, we convert the odds back to a probability.

The committee's incorrect assumption is:\n$$ \\text{RR}_{\\text{assumed}} = \\text{OR} = 0.60 $$\nUsing this assumed risk ratio, they calculate an incorrect risk for the treated group, which we will denote as $p'_{1}$:\n$$ \\frac{p'_{1}}{p_0} = 0.60 \\implies p'_{1} = 0.60 \\times p_0 = 0.60 \\times 0.30 = 0.18 $$\nThe assumed number of infections prevented per $N = 1000$ patients is based on this incorrect risk $p'_{1}$:\n$$ \\text{Prevented}_{\\text{assumed}} = N \\times (p_0 - p'_{1}) = 1000 \\times (0.30 - 0.18) = 1000 \\times 0.12 = 120 $$\n\n**Part 3: Quantify the overestimation**\n\nThe overestimation is the difference between the assumed number of prevented infections and the true number of prevented infections.\n$$ \\text{Overestimation} = \\text{Prevented}_{\\text{assumed}} - \\text{Prevented}_{\\text{true}} $$\n$$ \\text{Overestimation} = 120 - \\frac{1050}{11} = \\frac{120 \\times 11 - 1050}{11} = \\frac{1320 - 1050}{11} = \\frac{270}{11} $$\nTo provide the final numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction and round it to four significant figures.\n$$ \\frac{270}{11} \\approx 24.545454... $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $24.55$.
