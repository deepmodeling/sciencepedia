This fundamental case, which models the probability of an event without any predictors, is equivalent to analyzing a single proportion. This exercise  will guide you through deriving the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and its corresponding Wald confidence interval from first principles, solidifying your understanding of the relationship between the Bernoulli likelihood, the log-odds scale, and the core mechanics of statistical inference.",

            "problem": "A phase II single-arm pilot study in oncology evaluates an investigational agent where the binary outcome is clinical response within six weeks, recorded as $Y_{i} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for participant $i$. Investigators wish to report the baseline log-odds of response, assuming an intercept-only logistic regression model, which is appropriate when no covariates are included and the probability of response is constant across participants. The sampling model assumes independent Bernoulli trials with a common response probability $p$ and the link function satisfies $\\operatorname{logit}(p)=\\beta_{0}$, where $\\beta_{0}$ is the intercept.\n\nIn the study, $n=10$ participants were enrolled and $k=3$ responses were observed. Under standard regularity conditions for maximum likelihood estimation in logistic regression, derive from first principles the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$ and its large-sample Wald $95\\%$ confidence interval (CI) on the log-odds scale, using the Bernoulli likelihood and the Fisher information for $\\beta_{0}$. Use the standard normal two-sided critical value appropriate for a $95\\%$ CI.\n\nReport three numbers: the point estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_{0}$, the lower bound, and the upper bound of the Wald $95\\%$ CI, all on the log-odds scale. Round each reported value to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let the binary outcome for participant $i$ be $Y_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$, where $Y_i=1$ denotes a clinical response. The outcomes are modeled as independent and identically distributed Bernoulli random variables, $Y_i \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$, where $p$ is the common probability of response. The sample size is $n=10$, and the total number of observed responses is $k=3$.\n\nThe likelihood function for the observed data, which consists of $k$ responses and $n-k$ non-responses, is given by the product of the individual Bernoulli probabilities:\n$$L(p) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p^{y_i} (1-p)^{1-y_i} = p^{\\sum y_i} (1-p)^{n-\\sum y_i} = p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$$\n\nThe problem specifies an intercept-only logistic regression model, where the log-odds of response is related to the intercept $\\beta_0$ via the logit link function:\n$$\\operatorname{logit}(p) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p}{1-p}\\right) = \\beta_0$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the probability $p$ as a function of $\\beta_0$:\n$$p(\\beta_0) = \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)} = (1 + \\exp(-\\beta_0))^{-1}$$\nConsequently, $1-p$ can be expressed as:\n$$1-p(\\beta_0) = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)} = \\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)}$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the likelihood function gives the likelihood in terms of $\\beta_0$:\n$$L(\\beta_0) = \\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)}\\right)^k \\left(\\frac{1}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)}\\right)^{n-k} = \\frac{\\exp(k\\beta_0)}{(1+\\exp(\\beta_0))^n}$$\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of $\\beta_0$, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\beta_0) = \\ln(L(\\beta_0))$:\n$$\\ell(\\beta_0) = k\\beta_0 - n\\ln(1+\\exp(\\beta_0))$$\n\nWe find the maximum by differentiating $\\ell(\\beta_0)$ with respect to $\\beta_0$ and setting the result (the score function, $U(\\beta_0)$) to zero:\n$$\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\beta_0} = U(\\beta_0) = k - n \\frac{\\exp(\\beta_0)}{1+\\exp(\\beta_0)} = k - np$$\nSetting $U(\\hat{\\beta}_0)=0$ to find the MLE implies $k - n\\hat{p} = 0$, which yields the MLE for $p$ as $\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{n}$. By the invariance property of MLEs, the MLE for $\\beta_0$ is:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\operatorname{logit}(\\hat{p}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\hat{p}}{1-\\hat{p}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k/n}{1-k/n}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{n-k}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values $n=10$ and $k=3$:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_0 = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{10-3}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3}{7}\\right) \\approx -0.84729786$$\n\nNext, we derive the standard error for $\\hat{\\beta}_0$ using the Fisher information.
