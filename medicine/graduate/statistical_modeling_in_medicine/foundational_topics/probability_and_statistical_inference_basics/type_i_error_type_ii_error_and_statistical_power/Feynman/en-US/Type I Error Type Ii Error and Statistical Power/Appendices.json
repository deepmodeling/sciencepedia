The primary endpoint is measured on a scale where the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) is defined to be $3$ units. Historical data from large registries support modeling the endpoint as approximately normally distributed with a common, known population standard deviation $\\sigma=12$ units across arms, and independent measurements across participants. The design uses equal allocation with $n_{T}=120$ participants in the treatment arm and $n_{C}=120$ participants in the control arm.

Equivalently, if $\\beta$ denotes the Type II error rate (the probability of failing to reject the null hypothesis when a specified alternative is true), then power is $1-\\beta$. For a two-sample comparison of means with independent observations and a common, known standard deviation, the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means arises from properties of the normal distribution and the independence of samples.\n\nLet $\\bar{X}_{T}$ and $\\bar{X}_{C}$ denote the sample means in the treatment and control arms, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the power function, and then finding the worst-case (minimum) power over a specified range of uncertainty for the effect size $\\delta$ and standard deviation $\\sigma$.\n\n**Power Function Derivation:**\nLet $\\delta$ be the true mean difference and $\\sigma$ be the true common standard deviation. With a sample size of $n=100$ per arm, the estimator for the difference, $\\hat{\\delta} = \\bar{X}_{drug} - \\bar{X}_{control}$, follows a normal distribution: $\\hat{\\delta} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\delta, \\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n})$.\nThe two-sided test of $H_0: \\delta=0$ at significance level $\\alpha=0.05$ rejects the null hypothesis if $|\\hat{\\delta}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\sigma^2}{n}}$, where $z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$.\nThe power is the probability of this event occurring when the true difference is $\\delta$:\n$$ \\text{Power}(\\delta, \\sigma) = P\\left( |\\hat{\\delta}| > z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sigma\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n}} \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\delta, \\sigma \\right) $$\nThis can be expressed using the standard normal cumulative distribution function $\\Phi$:\n$$ \\text{Power}(\\delta, \\sigma) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}} - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right) + \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}} - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right) $$\nThis is the power as a function of $\\sigma$ and $\\delta$.\n\n**Worst-Case Power Calculation:**\nPower is a monotonically increasing function of the standardized effect size $\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sigma}$. To find the minimum power, we must find the minimum value of this ratio over the specified ranges.\nThe ranges are:\n- $\\delta \\in [0.8\\delta_0, 1.2\\delta_0] = [0.8 \\times 5, 1.2 \\times 5] = [4, 6]$ mmHg.\n- $\\sigma \\in [0.8\\sigma_0, 1.2\\sigma_0] = [0.8 \\times 12, 1.2 \\times 12] = [9.6, 14.4]$ mmHg.\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sigma}$ is minimized by taking the smallest possible numerator ($|\\delta|_{min} = 4$) and the largest possible denominator ($\\sigma_{max} = 14.4$).\nThe minimum standardized effect is $\\frac{4}{14.4} = \\frac{1}{3.6}$.\n\nWe compute the power for this worst-case scenario with $n=100$ and $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$. The key term is:\n$$ \\frac{|\\delta|}{\\sigma}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}} = \\frac{4}{14.4}\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{2}} = \\frac{1}{3.6}\\sqrt{50} \\approx 1.964185 $$\nSubstitute this into the power formula:\n$$ \\text{Power}_{min} = \\Phi(1.964185 - 1.95996) + \\Phi(-1.964185 - 1.95996) $$\n$$ \\text{Power}_{min} = \\Phi(0.004225) + \\Phi(-3.924145) $$\nUsing a standard normal calculator:\n$$ \\text{Power}_{min} \\approx 0.501685 + 0.000043 = 0.501728 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the worst-case power is $0.5017$.\n\n**Implications for Robust Trial Design:**\nThe sensitivity analysis reveals that the statistical power of the proposed trial is highly fragile to the initial planning assumptions. While the power at the baseline values ($\\delta=5, \\sigma=12$) is high (approx. 84%), a plausible unfavorable deviation in these parameters causes the power to plummet to approximately 50%. A power of 50% is equivalent to a coin toss, meaning the trial would have only a 50/50 chance of detecting a true therapeutic effect under this scenario. Conducting a trial with such a high risk of being inconclusive is scientifically and ethically untenable, as it wastes resources and exposes subjects to risk without a reasonable probability of generating useful knowledge. A robust design would maintain adequate power (e.g., $\\ge 80\\%$) across a range of plausible scenarios. This analysis implies that the proposed sample size of $n=100$ per arm is insufficient. The trial should be re-designed with a larger sample size, calibrated to achieve sufficient power even under this identified worst-case scenario.",
