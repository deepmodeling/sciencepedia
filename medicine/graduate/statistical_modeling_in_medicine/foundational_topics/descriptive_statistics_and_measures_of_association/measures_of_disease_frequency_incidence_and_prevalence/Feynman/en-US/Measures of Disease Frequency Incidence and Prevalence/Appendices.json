It describes a standard epidemiological calculation for an incidence rate and its confidence interval from cohort study data. The use of person-time and the Poisson model are standard practice for this scenario. All necessary data are provided, and there are no contradictions. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of a point estimate and a $95\\%$ exact confidence interval for an incidence rate.\n\n#### Part 1: Point Estimate of the Incidence Rate\n\nThe incidence rate, denoted by $\\lambda$, is defined as the number of new events per unit of person-time at risk. The point estimate, $\\hat{\\lambda}$, is calculated as the total number of observed events, $d$, divided by the total person-time at risk, $PT$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total person-time at risk by summing the follow-up times for all participants:\n$$\nPT = 1.2 \\text{ years} + 0.8 \\text{ years} + 2.0 \\text{ years} + 0.5 \\text{ years}\n$$\n$$\nPT = 4.5 \\text{ person-years}\n$$\n\nThe number of observed events is given as $d = 3$.\n\nThe point estimate of the incidence rate is then:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} = \\frac{d}{PT} = \\frac{3}{4.5} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\nConverting this to a decimal, we get:\n$$\n\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 2: 95% Exact Confidence Interval for the Incidence Rate\n\nThe problem specifies that the number of events follows a Poisson distribution. The total number of events, $d=3$, is a single observation from a Poisson distribution with mean $\\mu$. The mean $\\mu$ is related to the incidence rate $\\lambda$ and the total person-time $PT$ by the equation $\\mu = \\lambda \\times PT$.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the rate $\\lambda$, we first compute the confidence interval for the mean count $\\mu$, and then divide its limits by $PT$.\n\nThe exact confidence interval for a Poisson mean $\\mu$, given an observed count $d$, is based on the relationship between the Poisson and chi-squared ($\\chi^2$) distributions. For a $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval, the lower limit $\\mu_L$ and upper limit $\\mu_U$ for the mean $\\mu$ are given by:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)}\n$$\nwhere $\\chi^2_{p, \\nu}$ is the quantile of the chi-squared distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom that has a cumulative probability of $p$.\n\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $1-\\alpha = 0.95$, so $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $\\alpha/2 = 0.025$.\nThe observed number of events is $d=3$.\n\nThe degrees of freedom for the lower limit are $2d = 2 \\times 3 = 6$.\nThe degrees of freedom for the upper limit are $2(d+1) = 2 \\times (3+1) = 8$.\n\nWe need the following chi-squared quantiles:\n- For the lower limit: $\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2, 2d} = \\chi^2_{0.025, 6}$\n- For the upper limit: $\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2, 2(d+1)} = \\chi^2_{0.975, 8}$\n\nUsing statistical tables or software, we find these values:\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.025, 6} \\approx 1.237344\n$$\n$$\n\\chi^2_{0.975, 8} \\approx 17.534546\n$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the confidence limits for the mean count $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu_L = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1.237344 = 0.618672\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_U = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 17.534546 = 8.767273\n$$\nThese are the lower and upper limits for the expected number of events over $4.5$ person-years.\n\nTo find the confidence interval for the incidence rate $\\lambda$, we divide these limits by the total person-time, $PT = 4.5$ person-years.\n$$\n\\lambda_L = \\frac{\\mu_L}{PT} = \\frac{0.618672}{4.5} \\approx 0.1374827 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_U = \\frac{\\mu_U}{PT} = \\frac{8.767273}{4.5} \\approx 1.9482829 \\text{ events per person-year}\n$$\n\n#### Part 3: Final Results and Rounding\n\nThe problem requires rounding the point estimate, the lower limit, and the upper limit to four significant figures.\n\n- Point Estimate: $\\hat{\\lambda} \\approx 0.666666... \\to 0.6667$\n- Lower Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_L \\approx 0.1374827... \\to 0.1375$\n- Upper Confidence Limit: $\\lambda_U \\approx 1.9482829... \\to 1.948$\n\nThe final result is the ordered triplet $(\\hat{\\lambda}, \\lambda_L, \\lambda_U)$.\nThe three values are $(0.6667, 0.1375, 1.948)$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of epidemiology, self-contained, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data for the calculation of a directly standardized incidence rate are provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the directly standardized incidence rate for Harbor City. This process removes the confounding effect of age structure, allowing for a more equitable comparison of rates between populations with different age distributions. The method involves applying the age-specific incidence rates from the study population (Harbor City) to the age structure of a reference or standard population.\n\nLet the age strata be indexed by $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, corresponding to the age groups $0$–$19$, $20$–$49$, $50$–$79$, and $\\geq 80$ years, respectively.\n\nFirst, we calculate the age-specific incidence rates ($ASIR_i$) for Harbor City. The incidence rate is defined as the number of new cases ($C_i$) divided by the total person-time at risk ($PT_i$) in each stratum.\n\nThe given data for Harbor City are:\n- Stratum $1$: $C_1=60$ cases, $PT_1=120,000$ person-years\n- Stratum $2$: $C_2=450$ cases, $PT_2=180,000$ person-years\n- Stratum $3$: $C_3=600$ cases, $PT_3=90,000$ person-years\n- Stratum $4$: $C_4=150$ cases, $PT_4=15,000$ person-years\n\nThe age-specific incidence rates are:\n$$ ASIR_1 = \\frac{C_1}{PT_1} = \\frac{60}{120,000} = 0.0005 $$\n$$ ASIR_2 = \\frac{C_2}{PT_2} = \\frac{450}{180,000} = 0.0025 $$\n$$ ASIR_3 = \\frac{C_3}{PT_3} = \\frac{600}{90,000} = \\frac{1}{150} \\approx 0.006667 $$\n$$ ASIR_4 = \\frac{C_4}{PT_4} = \\frac{150}{15,000} = 0.01 $$\n\nNext, we use the person-time data from the standard population. Let $PT_{S,i}$ denote the person-years in the standard population for stratum $i$.\n- $PT_{S,1} = 30,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,2} = 40,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,3} = 25,000$ person-years\n- $PT_{S,4} = 5,000$ person-years\n\nThe total person-time in the standard population is:\n$$ PT_S = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} PT_{S,i} = 30,000 + 40,000 + 25,000 + 5,000 = 100,000 \\text{ person-years} $$\n\nTo find the directly standardized rate, we first calculate the number of cases that would be expected in each stratum of the standard population if it experienced the age-specific rates of Harbor City. Let $E_i$ be the expected number of cases in stratum $i$.\n$$ E_i = ASIR_i \\times PT_{S,i} $$\n- Expected cases in Stratum $1$: $E_1 = 0.0005 \\times 30,000 = 15$\n- Expected cases in Stratum $2$: $E_2 = 0.0025 \\times 40,000 = 100$\n- Expected cases in Stratum $3$: $E_3 = \\frac{1}{150} \\times 25,000 = \\frac{2500}{15} = \\frac{500}{3}$\n- Expected cases in Stratum $4$: $E_4 = 0.01 \\times 5,000 = 50$\n\nThe total number of expected cases, $E_{total}$, is the sum of the expected cases across all strata:\n$$ E_{total} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} E_i = 15 + 100 + \\frac{500}{3} + 50 = 165 + \\frac{500}{3} = \\frac{495 + 500}{3} = \\frac{995}{3} $$\n\nThe directly standardized incidence rate ($DSIR$) is the total number of expected cases divided by the total person-time of the standard population.\n$$ DSIR = \\frac{E_{total}}{PT_S} = \\frac{995/3}{100,000} = \\frac{995}{300,000} $$\n\nThe problem requires the rate to be expressed per $1,000$ person-years. Therefore, we multiply the $DSIR$ by $1,000$:\n$$ \\text{Rate per } 1,000 \\text{ person-years} = DSIR \\times 1,000 = \\frac{995}{300,000} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{995}{300} = \\frac{199}{60} \\approx 3.31666... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the standardized rate is $3.317$ per $1,000$ person-years.\n\nConceptually, this standardized rate differs from the crude (overall) incidence rate of Harbor City because the two rates are weighted averages of the same age-specific rates, but they use different sets of weights.\n\nThe crude incidence rate for Harbor City is calculated as:\n$$ \\text{Crude Rate}_{HC} = \\frac{\\text{Total Cases}_{HC}}{\\text{Total Person-Time}_{HC}} = \\frac{60+450+600+150}{120,000+180,000+90,000+15,000} = \\frac{1,260}{405,000} $$\nPer $1,000$ person-years, the crude rate is $\\frac{1,260}{405,000} \\times 1,000 = \\frac{1,260}{405} \\approx 3.111$ per $1,000$ person-years.\n\nThe crude rate is a weighted average of the age-specific rates, where the weights are the proportions of person-time in each age group within Harbor City:\n$ \\text{Crude Rate}_{HC} = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} ASIR_i \\times \\frac{PT_i}{PT_{HC, total}} $.\n\nThe standardized rate is also a weighted average of the same $ASIR_i$, but the weights are the proportions of person-time from the standard population:\n$ DSIR = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} ASIR_i \\times \\frac{PT_{S,i}}{PT_S} $.\n\nThe difference between the crude rate ($3.111$) and the standardized rate ($3.317$) arises because the age structures of Harbor City and the standard population are different, and the incidence of the condition is strongly dependent on age (a phenomenon known as confounding by age). The incidence rates are substantially higher in the older age groups ($ASIR_3$ and $ASIR_4$ are much larger than $ASIR_1$ and $ASIR_2$). The standard population has a slightly older age structure than Harbor City (e.g., the proportion of person-time for ages $50+$ is ($25,000+5,000)/100,000 = 30\\%$ in the standard population, versus ($90,000+15,000)/405,000 \\approx 25.9\\%$ in Harbor City). By applying Harbor City's high age-specific rates to the older structure of the standard population, we obtain a higher overall rate. This standardized rate represents the rate that would be observed in Harbor City if it had the same age structure as the standard population, thereby providing a basis for comparison that is free from the confounding effect of age.",

            "problem": "A closed cohort of individuals is observed from baseline for $3$ years to assess the occurrence of a particular disease event, called event $1$, in the presence of a competing failure type, event $2$.

Assume the competing risks framework applies, all individuals are event-free at baseline, there is no informative censoring, and the hazards remain constant throughout the $3$-year period.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions that (i) the survival function $S(t)$ reflects the probability of remaining free of any event up to time $t$, and (ii) the cumulative incidence function (CIF) for event $1$ at time $t$ is the cumulative probability of failing from event $1$ by time $t$ in the presence of competing risks, derive the expression for the $3$-year CIF for event $1$ using only these definitions and the stated assumptions.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of survival analysis and competing risks, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively stated.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the $3$-year Cumulative Incidence Function (CIF) for event $1$ in the presence of a competing risk (event $2$), using fundamental definitions. We are given constant cause-specific hazard functions for event $1$ and event $2$.\n\nLet $h_1(t)$ be the cause-specific hazard for event $1$ and $h_2(t)$ be the cause-specific hazard for event $2$. We are given that these are constant over time:\n$h_1(t) = h_1 = 0.04$ per year\n$h_2(t) = h_2 = 0.02$ per year\n\nThe observation period is $T = 3$ years.\n\nFirst, we address the overall survival function, $S(t)$, which is defined as the probability of remaining free of *any* event up to time $t$. In a competing risks framework, the overall hazard of experiencing any event, $h_{total}(t)$, is the sum of the cause-specific hazards, assuming the events are mutually exclusive.\n$$h_{total}(t) = h_1(t) + h_2(t)$$\nSince $h_1$ and $h_2$ are constant, $h_{total}$ is also constant:\n$$h_{total} = h_1 + h_2 = 0.04 + 0.02 = 0.06 \\text{ per year}$$\nThe survival function $S(t)$ is related to the cumulative overall hazard, $H_{total}(t) = \\int_0^t h_{total}(u) du$, by the formula $S(t) = \\exp(-H_{total}(t))$.\nFor a constant total hazard, the cumulative hazard is $H_{total}(t) = h_{total} \\cdot t$.\nTherefore, the survival function is:\n$$S(t) = \\exp(-h_{total} \\cdot t) = \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)t)$$\n\nNext, we derive the Cumulative Incidence Function for event $1$, denoted $CIF_1(t)$. The problem defines this as the cumulative probability of failing from event $1$ by time $t$ in the presence of competing risks. This can be formalized as the integral of the event-specific probability density function over the time interval from $0$ to $t$. The probability density of failing from event $1$ at a specific time $u$ is the product of the cause-specific hazard for event $1$ at time $u$, $h_1(u)$, and the probability of having survived event-free up to that time, $S(u)$.\nTherefore, the CIF is given by the integral:\n$$CIF_1(t) = \\int_0^t h_1(u) S(u) du$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $h_1(u)$ (which is the constant $h_1$) and $S(u)$:\n$$CIF_1(t) = \\int_0^t h_1 \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)u) du$$\nSince $h_1$ is a constant, it can be moved outside the integral:\n$$CIF_1(t) = h_1 \\int_0^t \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)u) du$$\nWe perform the integration:\n$$CIF_1(t) = h_1 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{h_1+h_2} \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)u) \\right]_0^t$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits of integration:\n$$CIF_1(t) = h_1 \\left( \\left( -\\frac{1}{h_1+h_2} \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)t) \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{h_1+h_2} \\exp(0) \\right) \\right)$$\n$$CIF_1(t) = h_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{h_1+h_2} - \\frac{1}{h_1+h_2} \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)t) \\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term yields the general formula for the CIF under constant cause-specific hazards:\n$$CIF_1(t) = \\frac{h_1}{h_1+h_2} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(h_1+h_2)t) \\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the $3$-year CIF for event $1$ by setting $t=T=3$ years:\n$$CIF_1(3) = \\frac{0.04}{0.04+0.02} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-(0.04+0.02) \\times 3) \\right)$$\n$$CIF_1(3) = \\frac{0.04}{0.06} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.06 \\times 3) \\right)$$\n$$CIF_1(3) = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( 1 - \\exp(-0.18) \\right)$$\nNumerically, $\\exp(-0.18) \\approx 0.83527021$.\n$$CIF_1(3) \\approx \\frac{2}{3} (1 - 0.83527021) = \\frac{2}{3} (0.16472979) \\approx 0.10981986$$\n\nThe problem asks to compare this to the quantity calculated by ignoring the competing risk, which is $Q = 1 - \\exp(-0.04 \\times 3)$.

The first significant figure is $3$. The four significant figures are $3$, $2$, $5$, $9$. The digit following the $9$ is $7$, which is $\\ge 5$, so we round up. Rounding $9$ up results in $0$ with a carry-over, so $3259$ becomes $3260$.\nThe rounded difference is $0.003260$. The trailing zero is significant.\nThe quantity $Q$ overestimates the true risk because it fails to account for individuals who are removed from the at-risk pool by the competing event (event $2$) and are therefore no longer eligible to experience event $1$.",
