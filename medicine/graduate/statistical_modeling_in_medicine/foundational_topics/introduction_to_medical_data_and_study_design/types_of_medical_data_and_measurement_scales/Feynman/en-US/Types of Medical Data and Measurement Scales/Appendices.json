A critical principle is that any valid summary statistic for a given scale must be invariant to the transformations that define that scale. This exercise provides a hands-on proof of why the sample mean is an inadmissible statistic for ordinal data, while the median is admissible.

            "problem": "A clinical trial collects a Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) pain rating on a $5$-level ordinal Likert scale, with categories labeled by integers $1,2,3,4,5$. Suppose the observed counts are $n_{1}=22$, $n_{2}=19$, $n_{3}=40$, $n_{4}=13$, $n_{5}=6$. In statistical modeling for medical data, admissible statistics for an ordinal measurement scale must be invariant under the class of strictly increasing transformations of the category labels because only relative order is meaningful on such scales. Starting from this foundational definition of ordinal scales and the standard definitions of the sample mean and median, do the following:\n\n1. From first principles, explain why strictly increasing transformations preserve the order of observations and therefore must leave any order-based statistic (such as the median) invariant in terms of category choice.\n\n2. Let $f(k)=k^{2}$ be a strictly increasing transformation on $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$. Compute the sample mean of the original coded data and the sample mean of the transformed data. Use these computations to demonstrate, without appealing to pre-stated results, that the mean is not invariant under strictly increasing transformations and thus is not admissible for ordinal data.\n\n3. Determine the median category before and after applying $f$, and justify why the median category is invariant under $f$.\n\nReport, as your final answer, the numerical value of the change in the mean induced by $f$, expressed as an exact fraction. Do not include units and do not round.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in foundational statistical theory, specifically measurement theory as it applies to medical data. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe total number of patients in the clinical trial is the sum of the counts for each category:\n$$N = n_{1} + n_{2} + n_{3} + n_{4} + n_{5} = 22 + 19 + 40 + 13 + 6 = 100$$\n\n**1. Invariance of Order-based Statistics (e.g., Median)**\n\nAn ordinal scale implies that the data can be ranked or ordered, but the magnitude of the difference between categories is not meaningful. The integer labels $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ represent an order, such that a patient reporting '$2$' has a higher pain level than one reporting '$1$', and lower than one reporting '$3$', but we cannot claim the difference in pain between '$1$' and '$2$' is the same as between '$2$' and '$3$'.\n\nAn admissible transformation for ordinal data is any strictly increasing function, $f$. By definition, a function $f$ is strictly increasing if for any two values $a$ and $b$ in its domain, $a < b$ implies $f(a) < f(b)$.\n\nLet the complete set of $N$ observations be denoted by $\\{x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N\\}$, where each $x_i$ is one of the category labels. Let's sort these observations to get the ordered set $x_{(1)} \\le x_{(2)} \\le \\dots \\le x_{(N)}$.\nNow, let's apply a strictly increasing transformation $f$ to each observation, creating a new set of transformed observations $\\{f(x_1), f(x_2), \\dots, f(x_N)\\}$.\nIf we consider any two original observations $x_{(i)}$ and $x_{(j)}$ from the sorted list such that $i < j$, we must have $x_{(i)} \\le x_{(j)}$.\nIf $x_{(i)} < x_{(j)}$, the property of the strictly increasing function $f$ guarantees that $f(x_{(i)}) < f(x_{(j)})$.\nIf $x_{(i)} = x_{(j)}$, then $f(x_{(i)}) = f(x_{(j)})$.\nCombining these, $x_{(i)} \\le x_{(j)}$ implies $f(x_{(i)}) \\le f(x_{(j)})$. This means that the transformation $f$ preserves the rank-ordering of the entire dataset. The sorted list of transformed observations is simply $f(x_{(1)}) \\le f(x_{(2)}) \\le \\dots \\le f(x_{(N)})$.\n\nAn order-based statistic is any statistic that depends only on the rank-ordering of the data. The median is the canonical example. The median of a dataset of size $N$ is determined by the value of the observation at the middle position(s) in the sorted list. Since the transformation $f$ does not change the position of any observation in the sorted list, the observation at the median position remains the same. While its numerical *value* is transformed from $x_{(\\text{median-pos})}$ to $f(x_{(\\text{median-pos})})$, the observation itself, and thus its original category, is invariant. Therefore, the median *category* is an admissible statistic for ordinal data.\n\n**2. Non-invariance of the Mean**\n\nThe sample mean of the original data, denoted $\\bar{x}$, is calculated as the sum of all observations divided by the total number of observations. Using the provided counts:\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} n_{k} \\cdot k = \\frac{1}{100} (n_{1} \\cdot 1 + n_{2} \\cdot 2 + n_{3} \\cdot 3 + n_{4} \\cdot 4 + n_{5} \\cdot 5)$$\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{100} (22 \\cdot 1 + 19 \\cdot 2 + 40 \\cdot 3 + 13 \\cdot 4 + 6 \\cdot 5)$$\n$$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1}{100} (22 + 38 + 120 + 52 + 30) = \\frac{262}{100} = 2.62$$\nThe problem defines a strictly increasing transformation $f(k) = k^{2}$ on the domain $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The new category labels are $f(1)=1$, $f(2)=4$, $f(3)=9$, $f(4)=16$, and $f(5)=25$.\nThe sample mean of the transformed data, denoted $\\bar{y}$, is:\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} n_{k} \\cdot f(k) = \\frac{1}{100} \\sum_{k=1}^{5} n_{k} \\cdot k^{2}$$\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{100} (22 \\cdot 1^{2} + 19 \\cdot 2^{2} + 40 \\cdot 3^{2} + 13 \\cdot 4^{2} + 6 \\cdot 5^{2})$$\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{100} (22 \\cdot 1 + 19 \\cdot 4 + 40 \\cdot 9 + 13 \\cdot 16 + 6 \\cdot 25)$$\n$$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1}{100} (22 + 76 + 360 + 208 + 150) = \\frac{816}{100} = 8.16$$\nWe observe that $\\bar{y} \\ne \\bar{x}$. Furthermore, the transformation applied to the original mean would be $f(\\bar{x}) = f(2.62) = (2.62)^{2} = 6.8644$, which is not equal to $\\bar{y}$. The mean is not invariant under this strictly increasing transformation. This is because the calculation of the mean treats the category labels as if they were on an interval scale, where distances between values are meaningful. The transformation $f(k)=k^2$ is non-linear and disproportionately changes these distances, thus altering the mean. This demonstrates that the mean is not an admissible statistic for ordinal data.\n\n**3. Invariance of the Median Category**\n\nThe total number of observations is $N=100$, an even number. The median is located between the $50$-th and $51$-st observations in the sorted dataset. We find the category for these positions by examining the cumulative counts:\n- Category 1: includes observations $1$ through $22$.\n- Category 2: includes observations $23$ through $22+19=41$.\n- Category 3: includes observations $42$ through $41+40=81$.\n- Category 4: includes observations $82$ through $81+13=94$.\n- Category 5: includes observations $95$ through $94+6=100$.\n\nBoth the $50$-th and $51$-st observations fall within the range for Category $3$. Thus, the median category of the original data is $3$.\n\nNow consider the data after applying the transformation $f(k)=k^2$. As established in Part 1, a strictly increasing transformation preserves the rank-order of all observations. The first $22$ observations are now labeled $1$, the next $19$ are labeled $4$, the next $40$ are labeled $9$, and so on. The observation that was $50$-th in the original sorted list is still $50$-th in the transformed sorted list. The observation that was $51$-st is still $51$-st.\nThe cumulative counts remain structurally identical. The observations at positions $50$ and $51$ still belong to the third group of observations. The original category for this group was $3$. So, the median category for the transformed data is also the one corresponding to the original category $3$. The numerical value of the median is now $f(3) = 3^2 = 9$. However, the *median category* (the third category in the ordered sequence) is unchanged, demonstrating its invariance.\n\nThe change in the mean induced by the transformation $f$ is the difference between the new mean and the original mean:\n$$\\Delta \\bar{x} = \\bar{y} - \\bar{x} = \\frac{816}{100} - \\frac{262}{100} = \\frac{554}{100}$$\nAs an exact fraction, this simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{554 \\div 2}{100 \\div 2} = \\frac{277}{50}$$\nThe numerator $277$ is a prime number, so this is the simplest form.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical measurement, well-posed with all necessary data and definitions, and expressed in objective language. It presents a clear, solvable problem in biostatistics without any factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of $\\rho(X,Y)$ and $\\tau(X,Y)$**\n\nSpearman’s rank correlation, $\\rho(X,Y)$, is the Pearson correlation coefficient applied to the ranks of the variables $X$ and $Y$.\nThe variable $X$ is given by the sequence $X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. As these values are already sorted and unique, their ranks, denoted $R_X$, are identical to the values themselves: $R_X = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThe variable $Y$ is given by the sequence $Y = \\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\\}$. This sequence is strictly increasing. Therefore, the ranks of $Y$, denoted $R_Y$, are $R_Y = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nSince the ranks are identical, $R_X = R_Y$, the relationship between the ranks is perfectly linear with a positive slope. The Pearson correlation of a variable with itself is $1$. Thus,\n$$\n\\rho(X,Y) = r(R_X, R_Y) = 1\n$$\n\nKendall’s rank correlation, $\\tau(X,Y)$, is defined as $\\tau = (N_c - N_d) / (N_c + N_d)$, where $N_c$ is the number of concordant pairs and $N_d$ is the number of discordant pairs. The total number of unique pairs of observations is $\\binom{n}{2} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$.\nA pair of observations $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ is concordant if the signs of $(x_i - x_j)$ and $(y_i - y_j)$ are the same.\nThe data for $X$ are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, which is a strictly increasing sequence.\nThe data for $Y$ are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\\}$, which is also a strictly increasing sequence.\nFor any two indices $i < j$, we will always have $x_i < x_j$ and $y_i < y_j$. This means $(x_i - x_j) < 0$ and $(y_i - y_j) < 0$, so their signs are the same. Consequently, all $15$ possible pairs of observations are concordant.\nTherefore, $N_c = 15$ and $N_d = 0$.\nThe value of Kendall's $\\tau$ is:\n$$\n\\tau(X,Y) = \\frac{15 - 0}{15 + 0} = 1\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\rho(X,Y')$ and $\\tau(X,Y')$**\n\nThe transformation is $Y' = T(Y) = \\ln(Y)$. The original values of $Y$ are $\\{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32\\}$.\nThe transformed values are $Y' = \\{\\ln(1), \\ln(2), \\ln(4), \\ln(8), \\ln(16), \\ln(32)\\} = \\{0, \\ln(2), 2\\ln(2), 3\\ln(2), 4\\ln(2), 5\\ln(2)\\}$.\nThe function $T(y) = \\ln(y)$ is a strictly monotonic increasing function for its domain $y \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$.\nSpearman's $\\rho$ and Kendall's $\\tau$ are both rank-based measures of correlation. A strictly monotonic transformation applied to a variable does not alter the ordering of its values. Therefore, the ranks of $Y$ and $Y'$ are identical. The set of ranks for $Y'$ is $R_{Y'} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, which is the same as $R_Y$.\nSince the ranks are unchanged, the calculation for $\\rho(X,Y')$ is identical to that for $\\rho(X,Y)$.\n$$\n\\rho(X,Y') = \\rho(X,Y) = 1\n$$\nSimilarly, since the ordering of the $Y$ values is preserved, the concordance or discordance of every pair of observations remains the same. The number of concordant pairs for $(X, Y')$ is still $N_c = 15$ and the number of discordant pairs is $N_d = 0$.\n$$\n\\tau(X,Y') = \\tau(X,Y) = 1\n$$\nThis invariance property is a fundamental characteristic of rank-based correlation coefficients, making them suitable for analyzing monotonic relationships on ordinal or transformed ratio/interval scales.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $r(X,Y)$ and $r(X,Y')$**\n\nPearson’s correlation, $r(X,Y)$, is given by $r(X,Y) = S_{XY}/\\sqrt{S_{XX}S_{YY}}$. First, we compute the necessary summary statistics for $X$ and $Y$ with $n=6$.\nThe means are:\n$\\bar{x} = \\frac{1+2+3+4+5+6}{6} = \\frac{21}{6} = 3.5$\n$\\bar{y} = \\frac{1+2+4+8+16+32}{6} = \\frac{63}{6} = 10.5$\n\nThe sums of squared deviations are:\n$S_{XX} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2 = (1-3.5)^2 + (2-3.5)^2 + \\dots + (6-3.5)^2 = (-2.5)^2 + (-1.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2 + (0.5)^2 + (1.5)^2 + (2.5)^2 = 6.25 + 2.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 2.25 + 6.25 = 17.5$.\n$S_{YY} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \\bar{y})^2 = (1-10.5)^2 + (2-10.5)^2 + \\dots + (32-10.5)^2 = (-9.5)^2 + (-8.5)^2 + (-6.5)^2 + (-2.5)^2 + (5.5)^2 + (21.5)^2 = 90.25 + 72.25 + 42.25 + 6.25 + 30.25 + 462.25 = 703.5$.\n\nThe sum of cross-products of deviations is:\n$S_{XY} = \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})(y_i - \\bar{y}) = (-2.5)(-9.5) + (-1.5)(-8.5) + (-0.5)(-6.5) + (0.5)(-2.5) + (1.5)(5.5) + (2.5)(21.5) = 23.75 + 12.75 + 3.25 - 1.25 + 8.25 + 53.75 = 100.5$.\n\nNow, we compute $r(X,Y)$:\n$$\nr(X,Y) = \\frac{100.5}{\\sqrt{17.5 \\times 703.5}} = \\frac{100.5}{\\sqrt{12311.25}} \\approx \\frac{100.5}{110.95607} \\approx 0.90576\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $r(X,Y) \\approx 0.9058$.\n\nNext, we compute $r(X,Y')$. The relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is given by $y_i = 2^{x_i-1}$. Applying the transformation $Y'=\\ln(Y)$, we find the relationship between $X$ and $Y'$:\n$$\ny'_i = \\ln(y_i) = \\ln(2^{x_i-1}) = (x_i-1)\\ln(2) = (\\ln 2)x_i - \\ln 2\n$$\nThis equation shows that $Y'$ is a perfect linear function of $X$ of the form $Y' = aX+b$, where the slope is $a = \\ln(2) > 0$ and the intercept is $b = -\\ln(2)$.\nPearson's correlation coefficient measures the strength of a linear relationship. When two variables have a perfect linear relationship with a positive slope, their Pearson correlation is exactly $1$. Therefore,\n$$\nr(X,Y') = 1\n$$\n\nThe change in Pearson's correlation from $r(X,Y) \\approx 0.9058$ to $r(X,Y') = 1$ is due to the nature of the measure. Pearson's $r$ is sensitive to nonlinear transformations. The relationship between $X$ and $Y$ is exponential, which is monotonic but nonlinear. Pearson's $r$ for this relationship is high but not equal to $1$, reflecting the deviation from perfect linearity. The logarithmic transformation linearizes this exponential relationship, resulting in a perfect linear association between $X$ and $Y'$. This demonstrates that while Pearson's $r$ is invariant under linear transformations, it is not invariant under nonlinear transformations, unlike the rank-based correlations $\\rho$ and $\\tau$. The change in $r$ correctly reflects the change in the geometric form of the relationship from exponential to linear.",

We use the law of total probability, conditioning on the true outcome status $Y$.\n$$\nq_{e} = \\Pr(Y^{\\ast}=1 \\mid E=e) = \\sum_{y=0}^{1} \\Pr(Y^{\\ast}=1 \\mid Y=y, E=e) \\Pr(Y=y \\mid E=e)\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions provided:\n-   $\\Pr(Y=1 \\mid E=e) = p_{e}$\n-   $\\Pr(Y=0 \\mid E=e) = 1-p_{e}$\n-   $\\Pr(Y^{\\ast}=1 \\mid Y=1, E=e) = \\mathrm{Se}$\n-   $\\Pr(Y^{\\ast}=1 \\mid Y=0, E=e) = 1 - \\Pr(Y^{\\ast}=0 \\mid Y=0, E=e) = 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}$\n\nThe expression for $q_e$ becomes:\n$$\nq_{e} = (\\mathrm{Se})(p_{e}) + (1-\\mathrm{Sp})(1-p_{e})\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship connects the observed probability to the true probability and the misclassification parameters.\n\nNext, we express the observed odds, $o_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{q_{e}}{1-q_{e}}$, in terms of the true odds, $o_{e} = \\frac{p_{e}}{1-p_{e}}$. To do this, we first find an expression for $1-q_{e}$:\n$$\n1-q_e = 1 - [\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p_e + (1-\\mathrm{Sp})(1-p_e)] = (1-\\mathrm{Se})p_e + \\mathrm{Sp}(1-p_e)\n$$\nNow we form the ratio for the observed odds:\n$$\no_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{q_e}{1-q_e} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot p_e + (1-\\mathrm{Sp})(1-p_e)}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})p_e + \\mathrm{Sp}(1-p_e)}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the true odds $o_e$, we divide the numerator and the denominator by $1-p_e$:\n$$\no_{e}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\left(\\frac{p_e}{1-p_e}\\right) + (1-\\mathrm{Sp})}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})\\left(\\frac{p_e}{1-p_e}\\right) + \\mathrm{Sp}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot o_e + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})o_e + \\mathrm{Sp}}\n$$\nThis equation relates the observed odds to the true odds in any exposure group $e$.\n\nThe observed odds ratio $\\theta^{\\ast}$ is the ratio of the observed odds in the exposed group ($e=1$) to the observed odds in the unexposed group ($e=0$):\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = \\frac{o_1^{\\ast}}{o_0^{\\ast}}\n$$\nUsing the relationship we just derived for $o_e^{\\ast}$:\n$$\no_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot o_1 + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})o_1 + \\mathrm{Sp}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad o_0^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot o_0 + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})o_0 + \\mathrm{Sp}}\n$$\nThe true odds ratio is $\\theta = o_1/o_0$, which implies $o_1 = \\theta \\cdot o_0$. Substituting this into the expression for $o_1^{\\ast}$:\n$$\no_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot (\\theta o_0) + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})(\\theta o_0) + \\mathrm{Sp}}\n$$\nNow we can form the observed odds ratio $\\theta^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = \\frac{o_1^{\\ast}}{o_0^{\\ast}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\theta o_0 + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})\\theta o_0 + \\mathrm{Sp}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot o_0 + 1-\\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})o_0 + \\mathrm{Sp}}}\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final closed-form expression for $\\theta^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\theta^{\\ast} = \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot \\theta \\cdot o_0 + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}}{(1-\\mathrm{Se})\\theta \\cdot o_0 + \\mathrm{Sp}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{(1-\\mathrm{Se})o_0 + \\mathrm{Sp}}{\\mathrm{Se} \\cdot o_0 + 1 - \\mathrm{Sp}} \\right)\n$$\n\n### Proof of Bias Toward the Null\n\nWe now consider the special case where $\\mathrm{Se} = \\mathrm{Sp} = S$, with the constraint $S > 1/2$. The relationship between observed and true odds simplifies. Let $f(o_e) = o_e^{\\ast}$.\n$$\nf(o_e) = \\frac{S \\cdot o_e + 1-S}{(1-S)o_e + S}\n$$\nThe observed odds ratio is $\\theta^{\\ast} = f(o_1)/f(o_0) = f(\\theta o_0)/f(o_0)$.\nTo demonstrate bias toward the null, we must show that if $\\theta > 1$, then $1 < \\theta^{\\ast} < \\theta$, and if $0 < \\theta < 1$, then $\\theta < \\theta^{\\ast} < 1$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the function $f(o)$. Its first derivative with respect to $o$ is:\n$$\nf'(o) = \\frac{S((1-S)o+S) - (1-S)(S \\cdot o + 1-S)}{((1-S)o+S)^2} = \\frac{S^2 - (1-S)^2}{((1-S)o+S)^2} = \\frac{2S-1}{((1-S)o+S)^2}\n$$\nGiven $S > 1/2$, $2S-1 > 0$. The denominator is a square and is positive. Thus, $f'(o) > 0$, which means $f(o)$ is a strictly increasing function. This ensures that the direction of the association is preserved: if $\\theta > 1$ (i.e., $o_1 > o_0$), then $f(o_1) > f(o_0)$ and $\\theta^{\\ast} > 1$. If $\\theta < 1$, then $\\theta^{\\ast} < 1$.\n\nTo show the attenuation of the magnitude (bias toward the null), we analyze the function $k(o) = f(o)/o$. We want to compare $\\theta^{\\ast}/\\theta$ with $1$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{\\theta} = \\frac{f(\\theta o_0)/f(o_0)}{\\theta} = \\frac{f(\\theta o_0)/(\\theta o_0)}{f(o_0)/o_0} = \\frac{k(\\theta o_0)}{k(o_0)}\n$$\nLet's find the derivative of $k(o)$:\n$$\nk'(o) = \\frac{f'(o) \\cdot o - f(o)}{o^2}\n$$\nThe sign of $k'(o)$ is determined by its numerator, $j(o) = f'(o) \\cdot o - f(o)$.\nLet's find the derivative of $j(o)$:\n$$\nj'(o) = f''(o) \\cdot o + f'(o) - f'(o) = o \\cdot f''(o)\n$$\nWe need the second derivative of $f(o)$:\n$$\nf''(o) = \\frac{d}{do}\\left[ (2S-1) ((1-S)o+S)^{-2} \\right] = (2S-1)(-2)((1-S)o+S)^{-3}(1-S) = -2(2S-1)(1-S) \\frac{1}{((1-S)o+S)^3}\n$$\nSince $S \\in (1/2, 1)$, we have $2S-1 > 0$ and $1-S > 0$. For any valid odds $o \\ge 0$, the denominator is also positive. Therefore, $f''(o) < 0$, meaning $f(o)$ is a strictly concave function.\nSince $f''(o) < 0$ and $o > 0$, we have $j'(o) = o \\cdot f''(o) < 0$. This means $j(o)$ is a strictly decreasing function for $o>0$.\nLet's evaluate $j(o)$ at $o=0$:\n$$\nj(0) = f'(0) \\cdot 0 - f(0) = -f(0) = -\\frac{1-S}{S}\n$$\nSince $S \\in (1/2, 1)$, $1-S > 0$ and $S>0$, so $j(0) < 0$.\nBecause $j(o)$ is strictly decreasing for $o>0$ and $j(0) < 0$, it follows that $j(o) < 0$ for all $o \\ge 0$.\nThis implies that $k'(o) < 0$ for all $o>0$, which means $k(o)=f(o)/o$ is a strictly decreasing function.\n\nNow we can prove the bias:\nCase 1: $\\theta > 1$.\nThis implies $\\theta o_0 > o_0$. Since $k(o)$ is strictly decreasing, $k(\\theta o_0) < k(o_0)$.\n$$\n\\frac{k(\\theta o_0)}{k(o_0)} < 1 \\implies \\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{\\theta} < 1 \\implies \\theta^{\\ast} < \\theta\n$$\nCombined with $\\theta^{\\ast} > 1$, we have $1 < \\theta^{\\ast} < \\theta$. Taking the natural logarithm, we get $0 < \\ln(\\theta^{\\ast}) < \\ln(\\theta)$.\n\nCase 2: $0 < \\theta < 1$.\nThis implies $\\theta o_0 < o_0$. Since $k(o)$ is strictly decreasing, $k(\\theta o_0) > k(o_0)$.\n$$\n\\frac{k(\\theta o_0)}{k(o_0)} > 1 \\implies \\frac{\\theta^{\\ast}}{\\theta} > 1 \\implies \\theta^{\\ast} > \\theta\n$$\nCombined with $\\theta^{\\ast} < 1$, we have $\\theta < \\theta^{\\ast} < 1$. Taking the natural logarithm, we get $\\ln(\\theta) < \\ln(\\theta^{\\ast}) < 0$.\n\nThus, nondifferential misclassification of a binary outcome, under the symmetric condition $\\mathrm{Se} = \\mathrm{Sp} > 1/2$, always biases the odds ratio toward the null value of $1$.",
