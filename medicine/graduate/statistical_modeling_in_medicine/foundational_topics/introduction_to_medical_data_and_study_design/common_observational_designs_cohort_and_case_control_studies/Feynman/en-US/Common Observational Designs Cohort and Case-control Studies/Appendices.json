This first practice starts with a classic closed cohort scenario to solidify the definitions of these two crucial measures of association. By first calculating the $RR$ and $OR$ from raw data and then deriving an analytical expression that connects them , you will gain a deeper, algebraic understanding of why the $OR$ approximates the $RR$ only when the outcome is rare and how it systematically overestimates the $RR$ as the baseline risk increases.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is based on standard, fundamental definitions in epidemiology and statistical modeling. The provided data are sufficient and plausible, and the tasks are clearly defined and formalizable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts, corresponding to the two tasks in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of Risk Ratio (RR) and Odds Ratio (OR)**\n\nThe givens from the $2 \\times 2$ contingency table are:\n- Exposed group: $a = 36$ with the outcome, $b = 84$ without the outcome.\n- Unexposed group: $c = 12$ with the outcome, $d = 108$ without the outcome.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of individuals in each group.\n- Total in exposed group: $N_1 = a+b = 36 + 84 = 120$.\n- Total in unexposed group: $N_0 = c+d = 12 + 108 = 120$.\n\nNext, we use the provided definitions to calculate the risk in each group.\n- The risk in the exposed group, $p_1$, is defined as $p_{1} = \\frac{a}{a+b}$.\n  $$p_{1} = \\frac{36}{120} = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{10 \\times 12} = \\frac{3}{10}$$\n- The risk in the unexposed group, $p_0$, is defined as $p_{0} = \\frac{c}{c+d}$.\n  $$p_{0} = \\frac{12}{120} = \\frac{1}{10}$$\n\nNow, we compute the Risk Ratio (RR), which is defined as $\\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{p_{1}}{p_{0}}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{RR} = \\frac{3/10}{1/10} = 3 $$\n\nTo compute the Odds Ratio (OR), we first need the odds for each group. The odds are defined as $\\text{odds} = \\frac{\\text{risk}}{1 - \\text{risk}}$.\n- The odds of the outcome in the exposed group are:\n  $$ \\text{odds}_1 = \\frac{p_1}{1-p_1} = \\frac{3/10}{1 - 3/10} = \\frac{3/10}{7/10} = \\frac{3}{7} $$\n- The odds of the outcome in the unexposed group are:\n  $$ \\text{odds}_0 = \\frac{p_0}{1-p_0} = \\frac{1/10}{1 - 1/10} = \\frac{1/10}{9/10} = \\frac{1}{9} $$\n\nThe Odds Ratio (OR) is the ratio of these odds.\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{\\text{odds}_1}{\\text{odds}_0} = \\frac{3/7}{1/9} = \\frac{3}{7} \\times 9 = \\frac{27}{7} $$\nAlternatively, for a $2 \\times 2$ table, the Odds Ratio can be calculated directly using the cross-product ratio:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{ad}{bc} = \\frac{36 \\times 108}{84 \\times 12} = \\frac{3888}{1008} $$\nSimplifying this fraction:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{3888 \\div 144}{1008 \\div 144} = \\frac{27}{7} $$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The numeric results, as a whole number and an exact fraction in simplest form, are $\\mathrm{RR} = 3$ and $\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{27}{7}$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of OR(R, p_0) and Algebraic Analysis**\n\nThe second task is to derive an expression for the Odds Ratio ($\\mathrm{OR}$) as a function of the Risk Ratio ($R$) and the baseline risk in the unexposed ($p_0$), and to show algebraically why the $\\mathrm{OR}$ diverges from the $R$ as $p_0$ increases.\n\nWe start with the fundamental definitions:\n1. Risk Ratio: $R = \\frac{p_1}{p_0}$, which implies $p_1 = R \\cdot p_0$.\n2. Odds Ratio: $\\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{p_1 / (1-p_1)}{p_0 / (1-p_0)}$.\n\nSubstitute the expression for $p_1$ from definition (1) into the expression for $\\mathrm{OR}$ from definition (2):\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{(R \\cdot p_0) / (1 - R \\cdot p_0)}{p_0 / (1-p_0)} $$\nWe can rearrange this expression:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = \\frac{R \\cdot p_0}{1 - R \\cdot p_0} \\times \\frac{1-p_0}{p_0} $$\nSince the problem is concerned with non-trivial risk, $p_0 > 0$, we can cancel the $p_0$ terms:\n$$ \\mathrm{OR} = R \\left( \\frac{1-p_0}{1 - R p_0} \\right) $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the Odds Ratio as a function of $R$ and $p_0$.\n\nNext, we must show algebraically why the $\\mathrm{OR}$ diverges away from $R$ as $p_0$ increases, holding $R$ fixed. The relationship is $\\mathrm{OR} = R \\cdot f(p_0)$, where the \"correction factor\" is $f(p_0) = \\frac{1-p_0}{1 - R p_0}$. The $\\mathrm{OR}$ is equal to $R$ if and only if $f(p_0) = 1$. This occurs when $1-p_0 = 1 - R p_0$, which simplifies to $p_0 = R p_0$. For $p_0 > 0$, this requires $R=1$ (no effect). For any $R \\neq 1$, the $\\mathrm{OR}$ is not equal to $R$ (unless $p_0=0$, which is trivial).\n\n\"Diverges away\" means the ratio $\\frac{\\mathrm{OR}}{R} = f(p_0)$ moves further from $1$ as $p_0$ increases. We analyze the behavior of $f(p_0)$ by examining its first derivative with respect to $p_0$. Using the quotient rule for differentiation, $[\\frac{u}{v}]' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}$, with $u(p_0)=1-p_0$ and $v(p_0)=1-R p_0$:\n$$ u' = -1, \\quad v' = -R $$\n$$ f'(p_0) = \\frac{d}{dp_0} \\left( \\frac{1-p_0}{1 - R p_0} \\right) = \\frac{(-1)(1 - R p_0) - (1-p_0)(-R)}{(1 - R p_0)^2} $$\n$$ f'(p_0) = \\frac{-1 + R p_0 + R - R p_0}{(1 - R p_0)^2} = \\frac{R-1}{(1 - R p_0)^2} $$\nThe denominator $(1 - R p_0)^2$ is always positive. The problem's positivity constraint $0 < p_0 < 1/R$ ensures $1-R p_0 > 0$, so the denominator is well-defined and non-zero. Therefore, the sign of the derivative $f'(p_0)$ is determined solely by the sign of the numerator, $R-1$.\n\nWe consider two cases for $R \\ne 1$:\n\nCase 1: $R > 1$ (Harmful exposure).\nIn this case, $R-1 > 0$, so $f'(p_0) > 0$. This means that $f(p_0)$ is a strictly increasing function of $p_0$. Also, for $R>1$ and $p_0>0$, the denominator $1-R p_0$ is smaller than the numerator $1-p_0$, so $f(p_0) = \\frac{1-p_0}{1-R p_0} > 1$. As $p_0$ increases, $f(p_0)$ increases, moving further away from $1$. Since $\\mathrm{OR} = R \\cdot f(p_0)$, the $\\mathrm{OR}$ becomes an increasingly larger overestimate of $R$.\n\nCase 2: $0 < R < 1$ (Protective exposure).\nIn this case, $R-1 < 0$, so $f'(p_0) < 0$. This means that $f(p_0)$ is a strictly decreasing function of $p_0$. For $0<R<1$ and $p_0>0$, the denominator $1-R p_0$ is larger than the numerator $1-p_0$, so $0 < f(p_0) < 1$. As $p_0$ increases, $f(p_0)$ decreases, moving further away from $1$ (towards $0$). Since $\\mathrm{OR} = R \\cdot f(p_0)$, the $\\mathrm{OR}$ becomes an increasingly larger underestimate of $R$ (i.e., $\\mathrm{OR}$ is closer to $0$ than $R$ is, and the gap widens).\n\nIn both cases, for any fixed $R \\ne 1$, as the baseline risk $p_0$ increases, the factor $\\frac{1-p_0}{1-R p_0}$ moves monotonically away from $1$. This causes the Odds Ratio to diverge from the Risk Ratio. This completes the algebraic demonstration.",

This exercise uses a carefully constructed numerical example to demonstrate that a marginal, or crude, $OR$ can differ from a conditional $OR$ that is constant across strata, even when there is no confounding. This hands-on demonstration  is vital for correctly interpreting results from stratified analyses and logistic regression, as it reveals how the $OR$ can change upon adjustment for a covariate that is a risk factor for the outcome, regardless of its association with the exposure.",

            "problem": "Consider an observational cohort study of a binary exposure $E \\in \\{0,1\\}$, a binary outcome $Y \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and a binary stratifying variable $Z \\in \\{0,1\\}$ (for example, a prognostic factor measured at baseline). The data are recorded as stratified $2 \\times 2$ tables of counts. Assume that there is no confounding by $Z$ in the sense that the exposure distribution is identical across strata of $Z$.\n\nThe stratum-specific counts are as follows:\n\n- For $Z=0$: among the unexposed group ($E=0$), there are $11$ cases ($Y=1$) and $99$ noncases ($Y=0$); among the exposed group ($E=1$), there are $20$ cases and $90$ noncases.\n- For $Z=1$: among the unexposed group ($E=0$), there are $14$ cases and $21$ noncases; among the exposed group ($E=1$), there are $20$ cases and $15$ noncases.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. All data required for the calculations are provided, and the terminology used is standard in the field of epidemiology and biostatistics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nLet $E$, $Y$, and $Z$ be binary variables representing exposure, outcome, and a stratifying factor, respectively, with values in $\\{0, 1\\}$. The count of subjects for each combination of these variables is denoted by $n_{eyz}$, where $e, y, z \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The provided data are:\n\nFor stratum $Z=0$:\n- $n_{110} = 20$ (Exposed $E=1$, Case $Y=1$)\n- $n_{100} = 90$ (Exposed $E=1$, Non-case $Y=0$)\n- $n_{010} = 11$ (Unexposed $E=0$, Case $Y=1$)\n- $n_{000} = 99$ (Unexposed $E=0$, Non-case $Y=0$)\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$:\n- $n_{111} = 20$ (Exposed $E=1$, Case $Y=1$)\n- $n_{101} = 15$ (Exposed $E=1$, Non-case $Y=0$)\n- $n_{011} = 14$ (Unexposed $E=0$, Case $Y=1$)\n- $n_{001} = 21$ (Unexposed $E=0$, Non-case $Y=0$)\n\n**1. Verification of Independence between Exposure $E$ and Stratifying Variable $Z$**\n\nThe problem states that $E$ and $Z$ are independent. We verify this by checking two conditions:\na) The proportion of exposed subjects is the same across strata of $Z$, i.e., $P(E=1|Z=0) = P(E=1|Z=1)$.\nb) The distribution of $Z$ is the same across exposure groups, i.e., $P(Z=1|E=0) = P(Z=1|E=1)$.\n\nFor condition (a):\nThe total number of subjects in stratum $Z=0$ is $N_0 = n_{110} + n_{100} + n_{010} + n_{000} = 20 + 90 + 11 + 99 = 220$.\nThe number of exposed subjects ($E=1$) in stratum $Z=0$ is $N_{E=1, Z=0} = n_{110} + n_{100} = 20 + 90 = 110$.\nThe proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=0$ is $P(E=1|Z=0) = \\frac{N_{E=1, Z=0}}{N_0} = \\frac{110}{220} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThe total number of subjects in stratum $Z=1$ is $N_1 = n_{111} + n_{101} + n_{011} + n_{001} = 20 + 15 + 14 + 21 = 70$.\nThe number of exposed subjects ($E=1$) in stratum $Z=1$ is $N_{E=1, Z=1} = n_{111} + n_{101} = 20 + 15 = 35$.\nThe proportion of exposed in stratum $Z=1$ is $P(E=1|Z=1) = \\frac{N_{E=1, Z=1}}{N_1} = \\frac{35}{70} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $P(E=1|Z=0) = P(E=1|Z=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$, the first condition is satisfied.\n\nFor condition (b):\nThe total number of unexposed subjects ($E=0$) across both strata is $N_{E=0} = (n_{010} + n_{000}) + (n_{011} + n_{001}) = (11+99) + (14+21) = 110 + 35 = 145$.\nThe number of unexposed subjects in stratum $Z=1$ is $N_{Z=1, E=0} = n_{011} + n_{001} = 14 + 21 = 35$.\nThe proportion of subjects with $Z=1$ among the unexposed is $P(Z=1|E=0) = \\frac{N_{Z=1, E=0}}{N_{E=0}} = \\frac{35}{145} = \\frac{7}{29}$.\n\nThe total number of exposed subjects ($E=1$) across both strata is $N_{E=1} = (n_{110} + n_{100}) + (n_{111} + n_{101}) = (20+90) + (20+15) = 110 + 35 = 145$.\nThe number of exposed subjects in stratum $Z=1$ is $N_{Z=1, E=1} = n_{111} + n_{101} = 20 + 15 = 35$.\nThe proportion of subjects with $Z=1$ among the exposed is $P(Z=1|E=1) = \\frac{N_{Z=1, E=1}}{N_{E=1}} = \\frac{35}{145} = \\frac{7}{29}$.\nSince $P(Z=1|E=0) = P(Z=1|E=1) = \\frac{7}{29}$, the second condition is also satisfied. Thus, $E$ and $Z$ are independent in this dataset. This confirms there is no confounding by $Z$ on the association between $E$ and $Y$.\n\n**2. Computation of Stratum-Specific Conditional Odds Ratios**\n\nThe odds ratio ($OR$) for the association between exposure $E$ and outcome $Y$ within a stratum $Z=z$ is defined as the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the exposed group to the odds of the outcome in the unexposed group.\n$$OR_z = \\frac{\\text{Odds}(Y=1|E=1, Z=z)}{\\text{Odds}(Y=1|E=0, Z=z)} = \\frac{n_{11z}/n_{10z}}{n_{01z}/n_{00z}} = \\frac{n_{11z}n_{00z}}{n_{10z}n_{01z}}$$\n\nFor stratum $Z=0$:\n$$OR_{Z=0} = \\frac{n_{110}n_{000}}{n_{100}n_{010}} = \\frac{20 \\times 99}{90 \\times 11} = \\frac{1980}{990} = 2$$\n\nFor stratum $Z=1$:\n$$OR_{Z=1} = \\frac{n_{111}n_{001}}{n_{101}n_{011}} = \\frac{20 \\times 21}{15 \\times 14} = \\frac{420}{210} = 2$$\n\nThe stratum-specific conditional odds ratios are identical: $OR_{Z=0} = OR_{Z=1} = 2$. This indicates no effect modification by $Z$ on the odds ratio scale. The common conditional odds ratio is $OR_{common} = 2$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Marginal Odds Ratio**\n\nTo compute the marginal odds ratio, we first collapse the data across the strata of $Z$ to obtain a single $2 \\times 2$ table for $E$ and $Y$. The counts in the marginal table, $n_{ey}$, are the sums of the stratum-specific counts: $n_{ey} = n_{ey0} + n_{ey1}$.\n\n- $n_{11} = n_{110} + n_{111} = 20 + 20 = 40$\n- $n_{10} = n_{100} + n_{101} = 90 + 15 = 105$\n- $n_{01} = n_{010} + n_{011} = 11 + 14 = 25$\n- $n_{00} = n_{000} + n_{001} = 99 + 21 = 120$\n\nThe marginal odds ratio, which ignores $Z$, is computed from this collapsed table:\n$$OR_{marginal} = \\frac{n_{11}n_{00}}{n_{10}n_{01}} = \\frac{40 \\times 120}{105 \\times 25} = \\frac{4800}{2625}$$\nTo simplify the fraction, we can divide the numerator and denominator by common factors. Both are divisible by $25$:\n$$OR_{marginal} = \\frac{4800/25}{2625/25} = \\frac{192}{105}$$\nBoth are divisible by $3$:\n$$OR_{marginal} = \\frac{192/3}{105/3} = \\frac{64}{35}$$\nSo, the marginal odds ratio is $\\frac{64}{35}$. Note that this value is different from the common conditional odds ratio of $2$. This illustrates the property of non-collapsibility of the odds ratio, which can occur even in the absence of confounding if the stratifying variable ($Z$) is associated with the outcome ($Y$).\n\n**4. Ratio of Marginal to Common Conditional Odds Ratio**\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio of the marginal odds ratio to the common conditional odds ratio.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{OR_{marginal}}{OR_{common}} = \\frac{64/35}{2} = \\frac{64}{35 \\times 2} = \\frac{32}{35} $$\nThe exact ratio is $\\frac{32}{35}$.",

The equation in terms of $z$ is:\n$$\n0.10 \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{z}{1+z}\\right) (0.70) \\;+\\; \\left(\\frac{2z}{1+2z}\\right) (0.30)\n$$\n$$\n0.10 \\;=\\; \\frac{0.7z}{1+z} \\;+\\; \\frac{0.6z}{1+2z}\n$$\nTo eliminate the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $(1+z)(1+2z)$:\n$$\n0.10 (1+z)(1+2z) \\;=\\; 0.7z(1+2z) \\;+\\; 0.6z(1+z)\n$$\nExpanding the terms on both sides:\n$$\n0.10 (1 + 3z + 2z^2) \\;=\\; (0.7z + 1.4z^2) \\;+\\; (0.6z + 0.6z^2)\n$$\n$$\n0.1 + 0.3z + 0.2z^2 \\;=\\; 1.3z + 2.0z^2\n$$\nRearranging the terms to form a standard quadratic equation of the form $Az^2 + Bz + C = 0$:\n$$\n(2.0 - 0.2)z^2 + (1.3 - 0.3)z - 0.1 \\;=\\; 0\n$$\n$$\n1.8z^2 + z - 0.1 \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nWe solve for $z$ using the quadratic formula, $z = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, with $A=1.8$, $B=1$, and $C=-0.1$:\n$$\nz \\;=\\; \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^2 - 4(1.8)(-0.1)}}{2(1.8)}\n$$\n$$\nz \\;=\\; \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 0.72}}{3.6}\n$$\n$$\nz \\;=\\; \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1.72}}{3.6}\n$$\nSince $z = \\exp(\\alpha^{\\star})$, it must be a positive value.
