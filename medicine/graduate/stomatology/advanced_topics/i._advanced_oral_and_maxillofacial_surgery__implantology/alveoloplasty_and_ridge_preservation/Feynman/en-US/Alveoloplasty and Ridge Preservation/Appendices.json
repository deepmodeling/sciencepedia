First, the threshold temperature for thermal injury is derived and calculated. Second, this temperature is used within a thermodynamic energy balance to determine the minimum required irrigation flow rate.\n\nPart 1: Threshold Temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{th}}$) Calculation\n\nThe extent of thermal injury is quantified by the injury integral, $\\Omega(t)$, defined by the Arrhenius model:\n$$\n\\Omega(t) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t} A\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T(\\tau)}\\right)\\,d\\tau\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the frequency factor ($4.50\\times 10^{40}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$), $E_{a}$ is the activation energy ($2.60\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$), $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$), and $T(\\tau)$ is the temperature history.\n\nThe problem assumes a constant exposure temperature, $T(\\tau)=T_{\\mathrm{th}}$, for a duration of $t=60\\,\\mathrm{s}$.

Our result represents the boundary of this empirical rule.\n\nPart 2: Minimum Volumetric Irrigation Flow Rate Calculation\n\nWe use a steady-state energy balance based on the first law of thermodynamics. The system is the control volume at the bone-bur interface. The problem assumes all generated heat is removed by the saline irrigant.\nThe rate of heat generation, $\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{gen}}$, is the fraction $f$ of the mechanical power $P_{\\mathrm{mech}}$ that is dissipated as heat:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{gen}} = f\\,P_{\\mathrm{mech}}\n$$\nThe rate of heat removal by the irrigant, $\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{removed}}$, is given by the change in enthalpy of the fluid:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{removed}} = \\dot{m}\\,c_{p}\\,(T_{\\mathrm{out}} - T_{\\mathrm{in}})\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, $c_{p}$ is the specific heat capacity, $T_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the inlet temperature, and $T_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the outlet temperature of the irrigant. We are given $T_{\\mathrm{in}}=293.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The problem specifies that the interfacial temperature must not exceed $T_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and that the exiting irrigant reaches this temperature, so we set $T_{\\mathrm{out}} = T_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n\nAt steady state, the rate of heat generation equals the rate of heat removal:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{gen}} = \\dot{q}_{\\mathrm{removed}}\n$$\n$$\nf\\,P_{\\mathrm{mech}} = \\dot{m}\\,c_{p}\\,(T_{\\mathrm{th}} - T_{\\mathrm{in}})\n$$\nWe need to find the volumetric flow rate, $Q$.

The provided data are self-contained, consistent, and physically realistic for the given context of stomatology. The problem requires a standard mathematical derivation from first principles, which is a legitimate and formalizable task. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the volume of a right circular frustum from first principles and its subsequent calculation for a specific set of parameters modeling a tooth socket. The method of choice for deriving the volume of a solid of revolution, such as a frustum, is integration by the method of disks.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the axis of rotation of the frustum is the vertical axis, which we will denote as the $z$-axis. The frustum extends from $z=0$ to $z=h$. The radius of the frustum, denoted by $r$, is a function of the height $z$. The problem specifies a linear taper. Therefore, the radius $r(z)$ must be a linear function of $z$.\n\nWe are given two points on the line that defines the profile of the frustum in the $zr$-plane:\nAt the apical end, which we place at $z=0$, the radius is $r_2$. This corresponds to the point $(0, r_2)$.\nAt the coronal end, which we place at $z=h$, the radius is $r_1$. This corresponds to the point $(h, r_1)$.\n\nThe general equation for a line is $r(z) = mz + c$, where $m$ is the slope and $c$ is the $z=0$ intercept.\nFrom the point $(0, r_2)$, we can see that the intercept $c$ is $r_2$.\nThe slope $m$ is calculated as the change in radius over the change in height:\n$$m = \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{h - 0} = \\frac{r_1 - r_2}{h}$$\nThus, the function for the radius at any height $z$ is:\n$$r(z) = \\left(\\frac{r_1 - r_2}{h}\\right)z + r_2$$\n\nTo find the volume of the frustum, we consider it as a stack of infinitesimally thin circular disks. Each disk is located at a height $z$ and has a thickness $dz$. The volume of a single such disk, $dV$, is the area of its circular face, $A(z)$, multiplied by its thickness, $dz$.\nThe area of a disk at height $z$ is given by $A(z) = \\pi [r(z)]^2$.\nTherefore, the differential volume element is:\n$$dV = \\pi [r(z)]^2 dz = \\pi \\left[ \\left(\\frac{r_1 - r_2}{h}\\right)z + r_2 \\right]^2 dz$$\n\nThe total volume $V$ of the frustum is the sum of the volumes of all such disks from $z=0$ to $z=h$.
