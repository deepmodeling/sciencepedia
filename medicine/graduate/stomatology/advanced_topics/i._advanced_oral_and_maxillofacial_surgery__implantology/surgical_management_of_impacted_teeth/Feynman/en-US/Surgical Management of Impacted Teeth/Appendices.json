            "problem": "A $65$ kilogram adult is scheduled for surgical removal of an impacted mandibular third molar. Local anesthesia with lidocaine containing epinephrine will be used for an inferior alveolar nerve block and supplemental buccal infiltration. The maximum recommended dose (MRD) for lidocaine with epinephrine is $7$ milligrams per kilogram. There is a standard adult absolute cap of $500$ milligrams. A $2\\%$ lidocaine solution means $2$ grams of solute in $100$ milliliters of solution, and each dental cartridge contains $1.8$ milliliters.\n\nStarting from the pharmacologic definition of milligrams per kilogram and the concentration definition for percentage solutions, derive the patient-specific MRD in milligrams. Then use the concentration-to-mass conversion to determine the mass of lidocaine per cartridge and convert the patient-specific MRD into the maximum number of full cartridges that does not exceed the dose. Confirm whether the patient-specific MRD is below the absolute cap. Express the final dose in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) and the cartridge count as a whole number of full cartridges. Provide your final answer as two values: the milligram dose and the integer number of cartridges.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Patient mass, $m_{patient}$: $65$ kilograms.\n- Maximum recommended dose (MRD) rate for lidocaine with epinephrine, $D_{rate}$: $7$ milligrams per kilogram.\n- Absolute maximum dose cap, $D_{cap}$: $500$ milligrams.\n- Lidocaine solution concentration, $C$: A $2\\%$ solution, defined as $2$ grams of solute in $100$ milliliters of solution.\n- Dental cartridge volume, $V_{cartridge}$: $1.8$ milliliters.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientific Grounding**: The provided values for the patient mass, the MRD of lidocaine with epinephrine ($7 \\, \\text{mg/kg}$), the absolute dose cap ($500 \\, \\text{mg}$), the definition of a $2\\%$ solution, and the volume of a standard dental anesthetic cartridge ($1.8 \\, \\text{mL}$) are all standard and factually correct within the fields of pharmacology and clinical dentistry. The problem is based on established scientific principles and clinical guidelines.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary data to calculate the patient-specific dose and the corresponding number of cartridges. The question is unambiguous, and a unique, meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in clear, objective language, free of subjective claims or bias.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe solution proceeds in four stages:\n1. Calculation of the patient-specific maximum recommended dose (MRD).\n2. Verification of this dose against the absolute maximum dose cap.\n3. Calculation of the mass of lidocaine per dental cartridge.\n4. Determination of the maximum number of full cartridges that can be administered without exceeding the patient-specific MRD.\n\n**1. Patient-Specific MRD Calculation**\nThe patient-specific MRD, denoted as $D_{patient}$, is calculated by multiplying the patient's mass, $m_{patient}$, by the dose rate, $D_{rate}$.\nLet $m_{patient} = 65 \\, \\text{kg}$ and $D_{rate} = 7 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}}$.\n\n$$D_{patient} = m_{patient} \\times D_{rate}$$\n$$D_{patient} = 65 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 7 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{kg}} = 455 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n\nSo, the maximum recommended dose for this specific patient is $455$ milligrams.\n\n**2. Verification Against Absolute Cap**\nThe calculated patient-specific dose, $D_{patient}$, must be compared to the absolute maximum dose cap, $D_{cap} = 500 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n$$D_{patient} = 455 \\, \\text{mg}$$\n$$D_{cap} = 500 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nSince $455 \\, \\text{mg}  500 \\, \\text{mg}$, the patient-specific dose is the limiting factor and is the correct value to use for further calculations. The effective MRD is therefore $D_{patient} = 455 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n\n**3. Mass of Lidocaine per Cartridge**\nThe concentration of the solution, $C$, is given as $2\\%$. This is defined as $2$ grams of solute per $100$ milliliters of solution. To be useful, this must be converted to milligrams per milliliter.\nWe know that $1 \\, \\text{g} = 1000 \\, \\text{mg}$.\n\n$$C = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{g}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = \\frac{2 \\, \\text{g} \\times 1000 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{g}}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = \\frac{2000 \\, \\text{mg}}{100 \\, \\text{mL}} = 20 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}}$$\n\nThe mass of lidocaine in a single cartridge, $m_{cartridge}$, is the product of this concentration and the volume of the cartridge, $V_{cartridge} = 1.8 \\, \\text{mL}$.\n\n$$m_{cartridge} = C \\times V_{cartridge}$$\n$$m_{cartridge} = 20 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{mL}} \\times 1.8 \\, \\text{mL} = 36 \\, \\text{mg}$$\nEach dental cartridge contains $36$ milligrams of lidocaine.\n\n**4. Maximum Number of Full Cartridges**\nThe maximum number of cartridges, $N$, is determined by dividing the patient-specific MRD, $D_{patient}$, by the mass of lidocaine per cartridge, $m_{cartridge}$.\n\n$$N = \\frac{D_{patient}}{m_{cartridge}} = \\frac{455 \\, \\text{mg}}{36 \\, \\frac{\\text{mg}}{\\text{cartridge}}} \\approx 12.6388... \\, \\text{cartridges}$$\n\nThe problem requires the maximum number of **full** cartridges that does not exceed the dose. This means we must take the integer part (floor) of the calculated value, as administering a $13$-th cartridge would exceed the MRD of $455 \\, \\text{mg}$ ($13 \\times 36 \\, \\text{mg} = 468 \\, \\text{mg}$).\n\nLet $N_{max}$ be the maximum number of full cartridges.\n$$N_{max} = \\lfloor N \\rfloor = \\lfloor 12.6388... \\rfloor = 12$$\n\nThus, the patient-specific MRD is $455$ mg, and the maximum number of full cartridges that can be safely administered is $12$.\n\nThe final answers are the patient-specific dose in milligrams and the integer number of cartridges.\n- Dose: $455 \\, \\text{mg}$\n- Cartridges: $12$",

            "problem": "A surgeon is planning the extraction of an impacted mandibular third molar and seeks to estimate the probability that the inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) canal is in contact with the tooth roots prior to raising a flap. The pretest probability of true inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) contact, based on population risk and cone-beam computed tomography availability constraints, is $0.10$. On the preoperative panoramic radiograph, a Rood sign (darkening of the root with canal diversion) is observed and considered as a binary diagnostic test, where its sensitivity is $0.80$ and its specificity is $0.70$ for detecting true IAN contact.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard application of Bayesian inference to a realistic clinical scenario in stomatology. All necessary data (pretest probability, sensitivity, specificity) are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or violations of scientific principles. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution can be formulated.\n\nLet us define the following events:\n- $D$: The event that true inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) contact exists. This corresponds to the presence of the condition.\n- $\\neg D$: The event that there is no true IAN contact. This corresponds to the absence of the condition.\n- $T$: The event that the Rood sign is observed on the radiograph. This corresponds to a positive test result.\n- $\\neg T$: The event that the Rood sign is not observed. This corresponds to a negative test result.\n\nFrom the problem statement, we are given the following probabilities:\n1. The pretest probability of true IAN contact, which is the prior probability of the condition, $P(D)$.\n$$ P(D) = 0.10 $$\nFrom this, the prior probability of no IAN contact is:\n$$ P(\\neg D) = 1 - P(D) = 1 - 0.10 = 0.90 $$\n\n2. The sensitivity of the Rood sign. Sensitivity is the probability of a positive test ($T$) given that the condition is present ($D$).\n$$ P(T|D) = 0.80 $$\n\n3. The specificity of the Rood sign. Specificity is the probability of a negative test ($\\neg T$) given that the condition is absent ($\\neg D$).\n$$ P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 0.70 $$\n\nFrom the specificity, we can determine the probability of a positive test given that the condition is absent ($\\neg D$). This is the false positive rate, which is $1$ minus the specificity.\n$$ P(T|\\neg D) = 1 - P(\\neg T|\\neg D) = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30 $$\n\nThe objective is to calculate the posttest probability of true IAN contact given a positive Rood sign. This is the posterior probability, denoted as $P(D|T)$. We use Bayes' theorem to calculate this value. Bayes' theorem is stated as:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T)} $$\nThe denominator, $P(T)$, is the total probability of a positive test result. It can be found using the law of total probability, summing over the mutually exclusive scenarios of having the condition or not having the condition:\n$$ P(T) = P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) $$\nSubstituting this into Bayes' theorem gives the full expression:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{P(T|D) P(D)}{P(T|D)P(D) + P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D)} $$\nNow, we substitute the known numerical values into this equation.\nThe numerator represents the probability of a true positive result (observing a Rood sign AND having true IAN contact):\n$$ P(T|D)P(D) = (0.80)(0.10) = 0.08 $$\nThe denominator's second term represents the probability of a false positive result (observing a Rood sign BUT not having true IAN contact):\n$$ P(T|\\neg D)P(\\neg D) = (0.30)(0.90) = 0.27 $$\nThe total probability of a positive test, $P(T)$, is the sum of the probabilities of true positives and false positives:\n$$ P(T) = 0.08 + 0.27 = 0.35 $$\nFinally, we can calculate the posttest probability $P(D|T)$:\n$$ P(D|T) = \\frac{0.08}{0.35} $$\nPerforming the division:\n$$ P(D|T) \\approx 0.2285714... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $2$, $2$, $8$, and $5$. The fifth digit is $7$, which is $5$ or greater, so we round up the fourth significant digit.\n$$ P(D|T) \\approx 0.2286 $$\nThus, the posttest probability of true IAN contact, given the observation of a positive Rood sign, is approximately $0.2286$.",

Only the numerical torque should be reported as the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution based on fundamental principles of classical mechanics.\n\nThe problem describes the use of a straight dental elevator as a class I lever in a state of quasi-static equilibrium. A class I lever is characterized by the fulcrum being positioned between the effort force and the load (resistance) force. In this scenario, the alveolar crest acts as the fulcrum, the operator's hand applies the effort force, and the impacted tooth provides the load or resistance.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this system is the condition for rotational equilibrium, which states that the sum of all moments (torques) about any point must be zero. For a lever in equilibrium, the magnitude of the effort torque must equal the magnitude of the load torque about the fulcrum.\n\nTorque, denoted by $\\tau$, is the rotational equivalent of force and is defined as the product of the magnitude of the force, $F$, and the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation (the fulcrum) to the line of action of the force. This distance is called the lever arm, $d$.\n$$ \\tau = F \\times d $$\n\nLet $F_E$ be the effort force applied by the operator and $d_E$ be the corresponding effort arm. The effort torque is:\n$$ \\tau_E = F_E \\times d_E $$\nLet $F_L$ be the resistance force from the tooth (the load) and $d_L$ be the corresponding load arm. The load torque is:\n$$ \\tau_L = F_L \\times d_L $$\nFor the system to be in quasi-static equilibrium, the net torque is zero. This implies that the magnitude of the effort torque is equal to the magnitude of the load torque:\n$$ |\\tau_E| = |\\tau_L| $$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of the moment transmitted to the tooth about the fulcrum. This is precisely the load torque, $\\tau_L$, which is equal in magnitude to the effort torque, $\\tau_E$, generated by the operator.\n\nThe given values are:\nEffort force, $F_E = 40\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\nEffort arm, $d_E = 8\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\nLoad arm, $d_L = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nThe moment transmitted to the tooth can be calculated directly from the effort side of the lever:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tooth}} = \\tau_E = F_E \\times d_E $$\nThe unit for the final answer must be in Newton-meters ($\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$), so the effort arm distance must be converted from centimeters to meters.\n$$ d_E = 8\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nNow, we can calculate the torque:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tooth}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{N} \\times 0.08\\,\\mathrm{m} = 3.2\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tooth}} = 3.20\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m} $$\nThe information about the load arm, $d_L = 2\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, is not required to find the torque on the tooth, but it can be used to calculate the mechanical advantage (MA) and the force exerted on the tooth. The MA is the ratio of the load force to the effort force, which is also equal to the ratio of the lever arms:\n$$ \\mathrm{MA} = \\frac{d_E}{d_L} = \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{2\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 4 $$\nThis means the force is amplified by a factor of $4$. The force on the tooth is $F_L = \\mathrm{MA} \\times F_E = 4 \\times 40\\,\\mathrm{N} = 160\\,\\mathrm{N}$. This confirms the lever's function but is not the requested answer.\n\nRegarding the mechanistic explanation, the lever arm ratio, $\\frac{d_E}{d_L}$, is the mechanical advantage of the system. This ratio is central to controlled luxation strategy for two main reasons:\n1.  **Force Amplification**: A mechanical advantage greater than $1$ (in this case, $\\mathrm{MA} = 4$) allows the surgeon to apply a small, finely controlled hand force ($F_E$) to generate a much larger force ($F_L$) at the tooth-elevator interface. This amplified force is necessary to exceed the tensile strength of the periodontal ligament (PDL) fibers, which anchor the tooth to the alveolar bone.\n2.  **Displacement Reduction and Control**: The trade-off for force amplification is a reduction in displacement. The distance the elevator tip moves is inversely proportional to the mechanical advantage. A large, discernible movement of the operator's hand results in a very small, precise movement at the working end. This enhanced precision allows the surgeon to perform controlled, incremental applications of force, carefully severing the PDL fibers while continuously receiving tactile feedback through the instrument. This feedback helps differentiate the elastic \"give\" of the PDL from the unyielding resistance of bone. By judiciously selecting an instrument and fulcrum point to establish an appropriate lever arm ratio, the surgeon can apply sufficient force for luxation while minimizing the risk of an uncontrolled, catastrophic force application that could lead to alveolar bone fracture, damage to adjacent structures, or fracture of the tooth root itself.",
