Let the spatial coordinate be $x$ (in millimeters) measured apically from the coronal margin, and let time be $t$ (in days) measured from the end of surgery when the wound is closed.

It is a straightforward application of fundamental kinematic principles to a biomedical engineering context. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe problem models the movement of two cell fronts as one-dimensional motion with constant velocity. The general kinematic equation for the position $x$ of an object as a function of time $t$, given an initial position $x_0$ at an initial time $t_0$ and a constant velocity $v$, is:\n$$x(t) = x_0 + v(t - t_0)$$\nIn this problem, for both cell fronts, the initial position is $x_0 = 0$ at the initial time $t_0 = 0$. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:\n$$x(t) = v \\cdot t$$\n\n**1. Derive expressions for the positions $x_{\\mathrm{E}}(t)$ and $x_{\\mathrm{PDL}}(t)$**\n\nFor the oral epithelium front, the constant speed is given as $v_{\\mathrm{E}} = 0.5$ mm/day. Using the simplified kinematic equation, its position as a function of time $t$ is:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{E}}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{E}} \\cdot t = 0.5 t$$\n\nFor the periodontal ligament (PDL) front, the constant speed is given as $v_{\\mathrm{PDL}} = 0.2$ mm/day. Similarly, its position as a function of time $t$ is:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{PDL}}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{PDL}} \\cdot t = 0.2 t$$\nThe units for position are in millimeters (mm) when time $t$ is in days.\n\n**2. Evaluate the positions at $t=7$ days**\n\nWe are asked to evaluate these positions at a specific time, $t=7$ days.\n\nThe position of the epithelium front at $t=7$ is:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{E}}(7) = 0.5 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 3.5 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nThe position of the periodontal ligament front at $t=7$ is:\n$$x_{\\mathrm{PDL}}(7) = 0.2 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 1.4 \\text{ mm}$$\n\n**3. Compute the separation $\\Delta(7)$**\n\nThe separation between the two fronts is defined as $\\Delta(t) = x_{\\mathrm{E}}(t) - x_{\\mathrm{PDL}}(t)$. First, we can find the general expression for separation as a function of time:\n$$\\Delta(t) = (0.5 t) - (0.2 t) = (0.5 - 0.2) t = 0.3 t$$\n\nNow, we evaluate this separation at $t=7$ days:\n$$\\Delta(7) = 0.3 \\frac{\\text{mm}}{\\text{day}} \\times 7 \\text{ days} = 2.1 \\text{ mm}$$\n\nAlternatively, we can compute this directly from the positions evaluated in the previous step:\n$$\\Delta(7) = x_{\\mathrm{E}}(7) - x_{\\mathrm{PDL}}(7) = 3.5 \\text{ mm} - 1.4 \\text{ mm} = 2.1 \\text{ mm}$$\nThe results are consistent.\n\n**4.

The values are $3.5$, $1.4$, and $2.1$, all in units of millimeters.\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 3.5 & 1.4 & 2.1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The bacterial dimensions are reasonable, simplified estimates for the purposes of a model.

It is factually and scientifically sound within the context of a simplified physical model.\n2.  It is directly formalizable and relevant to the specified topic in stomatology.\n3.

The values and conditions are physically plausible.\n5.  It is well-structured and leads to a unique, meaningful solution.\n6.  While straightforward, it requires careful reading and correct application of logical conditions (`AND`) and definitions, making it a valid test of reasoning rather than a trivial exercise.\n7.  The claims are verifiable through logical deduction based on the provided premises.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires determining the critical pore diameter, $d_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, for a barrier membrane designed to block two types of bacteria, and then evaluating an indicator variable, $S$, for a specific proposed pore diameter, $d_0$.\n\nThe fundamental principle given is that a particle is blocked if the pore diameter is smaller than the particle's diameter. Let $d_p$ be the pore diameter.\nThe condition for a particle of minimum diameter $d_{\\text{particle}}$ to be blocked is:\n$$d_p < d_{\\text{particle}}$$\n\nThe membrane must block two classes of bacteria:\n1.  Cocci with diameter $d_{c} = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n2.  Rods with a minimum cross-sectional diameter $d_{r} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nTo block the cocci, the pore diameter must satisfy:\n$$d_p < d_{c} \\implies d_p < 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nTo block the rods, the pore diameter must satisfy:\n$$d_p < d_{r} \\implies d_p < 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nFor the membrane to be effective against both classes, its pore diameter $d_p$ must satisfy both conditions simultaneously. This corresponds to the logical conjunction of the two inequalities:\n$$d_p < 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\quad \\text{AND} \\quad d_p < 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThis pair of inequalities is satisfied if and only if $d_p$ is less than the smaller of the two values. Mathematically:\n$$d_p < \\min(d_{c}, d_{r})$$\n\nWe calculate the minimum of the two bacterial diameters:\n$$\\min(d_{c}, d_{r}) = \\min(1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}, 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThus, any pore diameter $d_p < 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ will guarantee the exclusion of both bacterial classes.\n\nThe problem defines $d_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ as \"the largest pore diameter that still guarantees size-exclusion\". This corresponds to the boundary of the effective region. A pore of diameter precisely $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ would not guarantee exclusion of the cocci, but any diameter infinitesimally smaller would. Therefore, the critical threshold value is the least upper bound (supremum) of the set of effective pore diameters.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\sup\\left(\\{d_p \\mid d_p  1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}\\}\\right) = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nThe problem specifies that this value must be rounded to $2$ significant figures. The number $1$ has one significant figure. To express it with two, we write it as $1.0$.\n$$d_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nNext, we must compute the indicator variable $S$. The problem provides an explicit rule for $S$:\n$S=1$ if $d_{0} \\le d_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, and $S=0$ otherwise.\n\nWe are given the proposed pore diameter $d_{0} = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. We compare this to the calculated $d_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$d_{0} = 0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n$$d_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\n\nWe check the condition $d_{0} \\le d_{\\mathrm{crit}}$:\n$$0.3\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} \\le 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nThis inequality is true. According to the definition of $S$, since the condition is met, we have:\n$$S = 1$$\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a two-entry row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} d_{\\mathrm{crit}}  S \\end{pmatrix}$. Substituting the computed values:\n$$d_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 1.0$$\n$$S = 1$$\n\nThe resulting matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix} 1.0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
