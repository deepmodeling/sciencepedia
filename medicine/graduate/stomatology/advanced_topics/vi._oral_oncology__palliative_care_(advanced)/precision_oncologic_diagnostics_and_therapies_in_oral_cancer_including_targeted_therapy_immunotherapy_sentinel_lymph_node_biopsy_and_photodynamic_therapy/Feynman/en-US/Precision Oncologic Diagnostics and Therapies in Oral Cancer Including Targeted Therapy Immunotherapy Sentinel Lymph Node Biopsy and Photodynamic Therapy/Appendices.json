            "problem": "A precision diagnostic is being evaluated to stage occult cervical lymph node metastasis in early-stage oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma, where the decision to perform elective neck dissection and to tailor adjuvant systemic therapy relies on accurate nodal status. The test is a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) enhanced with cytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the clinically node-negative population under consideration, the prevalence of occult nodal metastasis is $0.20$. Validation data for the SLNB protocol show a sensitivity of $0.90$ and a specificity of $0.95$. Using only foundational definitions of sensitivity, specificity, and Bayes’ theorem, first compute the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) in this setting, expressing all probabilities as decimals. Next, apply these characteristics to a cohort of $100$ consecutive, otherwise similar patients and estimate the expected numbers of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Finally, report the total expected number of correct classifications in the cohort as your final answer. If any intermediate quantities do not simplify to exact integers, retain exact decimal or fractional values. The final reported count of correct classifications must be an exact integer.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided.\n\nLet $D+$ be the event that a patient has occult nodal metastasis (disease is present), and $D-$ be the event that the patient does not have the disease. Let $T+$ be the event of a positive test result, and $T-$ be the event of a negative test result.\n\nThe given information can be stated in terms of conditional probabilities:\nThe prevalence of the disease is the prior probability of a patient having the disease:\n$$P(D+) = 0.20$$\nThe sensitivity of the test is the probability of a positive test given the disease is present:\n$$P(T+|D+) = 0.90$$\nThe specificity of the test is the probability of a negative test given the disease is absent:\n$$P(T-|D-) = 0.95$$\n\nFrom this information, we derive the complementary probabilities:\nThe probability of a patient not having the disease:\n$$P(D-) = 1 - P(D+) = 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$$\nThe false negative rate (the probability of a negative test given the disease is present):\n$$P(T-|D+) = 1 - P(T+|D+) = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10$$\nThe false positive rate (the probability of a positive test given the disease is absent):\n$$P(T+|D-) = 1 - P(T-|D-) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV).\n\nThe PPV is the probability that a patient with a positive test result actually has the disease, denoted $P(D+|T+)$. We use Bayes' theorem:\n$$PPV = P(D+|T+) = \\frac{P(T+|D+) P(D+)}{P(T+)}$$\nTo calculate this, we first need the total probability of a positive test, $P(T+)$, which is found using the law of total probability:\n$$P(T+) = P(T+|D+)P(D+) + P(T+|D-)P(D-)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T+) = (0.90)(0.20) + (0.05)(0.80) = 0.18 + 0.04 = 0.22$$\nNow, we can compute the PPV:\n$$PPV = \\frac{0.18}{0.22} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11} \\approx 0.8182$$\nSo, the positive predictive value is exactly $\\frac{9}{11}$, or approximately $0.8182$.\n\nThe NPV is the probability that a patient with a negative test result is actually disease-free, denoted $P(D-|T-)$. Using Bayes' theorem again:\n$$NPV = P(D-|T-) = \\frac{P(T-|D-) P(D-)}{P(T-)}$$\nFirst, we find the total probability of a negative test, $P(T-)$:\n$$P(T-) = P(T-|D+)P(D+) + P(T-|D-)P(D-)$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$P(T-) = (0.10)(0.20) + (0.95)(0.80) = 0.02 + 0.76 = 0.78$$\nAs a consistency check, $P(T+) + P(T-) = 0.22 + 0.78 = 1.00$.\nNow, we can compute the NPV:\n$$NPV = \\frac{0.76}{0.78} = \\frac{76}{78} = \\frac{38}{39} \\approx 0.9744$$\nSo, the negative predictive value is exactly $\\frac{38}{39}$, or approximately $0.9744$.\n\nThe second task is to apply these findings to a cohort of $N=100$ patients to find the expected number of true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN).\n\nThe expected number of patients with the disease in the cohort is:\n$$N_{D+} = N \\times P(D+) = 100 \\times 0.20 = 20$$\nThe expected number of patients without the disease is:\n$$N_{D-} = N \\times P(D-) = 100 \\times 0.80 = 80$$\n\nWe can now calculate the expected counts for each category:\n-   Expected True Positives ($E[TP]$): Patients with the disease who test positive.\n$$E[TP] = N_{D+} \\times P(T+|D+) = 20 \\times 0.90 = 18$$\n-   Expected False Negatives ($E[FN]$): Patients with the disease who test negative.\n$$E[FN] = N_{D+} \\times P(T-|D+) = 20 \\times 0.10 = 2$$\n-   Expected True Negatives ($E[TN]$): Patients without the disease who test negative.\n$$E[TN] = N_{D-} \\times P(T-|D-) = 80 \\times 0.95 = 76$$\n-   Expected False Positives ($E[FP]$): Patients without the disease who test positive.\n$$E[FP] = N_{D-} \\times P(T+|D-) = 80 \\times 0.05 = 4$$\n\nThe final task is to report the total expected number of correct classifications. Correct classifications are the sum of true positives and true negatives.\n$$E[\\text{Correct Classifications}] = E[TP] + E[TN]$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$E[\\text{Correct Classifications}] = 18 + 76 = 94$$\nThe total expected number of correct classifications in the cohort of $100$ patients is $94$.

Suppose the response probabilities are hypothesized to be $p_{1} = 0.45$ in the FGFR-altered cohort and $p_{2} = 0.25$ in the non-altered cohort, giving a planned response rate difference $\\Delta = p_{1} - p_{2} = 0.20$.

A full derivation and solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Sample Size Formula\n\nLet $X_1$ and $X_2$ be the number of responders in the FGFR-altered and non-altered cohorts, respectively. The outcomes are modeled as independent binomial random variables: $X_1 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_1)$ and $X_2 \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n, p_2)$. The corresponding sample proportions are $\\hat{p}_1 = X_1/n$ and $\\hat{p}_2 = X_2/n$.\n\nBy the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), for a sufficiently large $n$, the sample proportions are approximately normally distributed:\n$$ \\hat{p}_1 \\approx N\\left(p_1, \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n}\\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{p}_2 \\approx N\\left(p_2, \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n}\\right) $$\nSince the two samples are independent, the difference in sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2$, is also approximately normally distributed with mean $E[\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2] = p_1 - p_2$ and variance $Var(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) = \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n}$.\n\nThe hypotheses for the two-sided test are:\n-   Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): $p_1 = p_2$. This implies the difference in proportions is zero, $p_1 - p_2 = 0$.\n-   Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$): $p_1 \\neq p_2$.\n\n**Distribution under the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**\nUnder $H_0$, let the common unknown proportion be $p$. The distribution of the difference is:\n$$ (\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\big| H_0 \\approx N\\left(0, \\frac{p(1-p)}{n} + \\frac{p(1-p)}{n}\\right) = N\\left(0, \\frac{2p(1-p)}{n}\\right) $$\nFor sample size planning, the unknown common proportion $p$ is estimated using the average of the hypothesized proportions under the alternative, $\\bar{p} = \\frac{p_1+p_2}{2}$. This is consistent with using a pooled variance for the test statistic. The standard error under $H_0$ is thus:\n$$ SE_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} $$\nThe two-sided test rejects $H_0$ at a significance level $\\alpha$ if the observed difference $|\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2|$ is greater than a critical value $C$. This critical value is defined by:\n$$ C = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\cdot SE_0 = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} $$\n\n**Distribution under the Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$)**\nUnder the specific alternative we wish to detect, $p_1$ and $p_2$ are given. The distribution of the difference is:\n$$ (\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) \\big| H_a \\approx N\\left(p_1 - p_2, \\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n} + \\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n}\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies using the unpooled standard error under the alternative. Let $\\Delta = p_1 - p_2$. The standard error under $H_a$ is:\n$$ SE_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}{n}} $$\nPower ($1-\\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_a$ is true. Assuming $\\Delta > 0$, this is primarily the probability that $\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 > C$:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2 > C | H_a) $$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the expression with respect to the distribution under $H_a$:\n$$ 1-\\beta = P\\left( \\frac{(\\hat{p}_1 - \\hat{p}_2) - \\Delta}{SE_A} > \\frac{C - \\Delta}{SE_A} \\right) $$\nThe term on the left inside the probability is a standard normal variable $Z$. Thus, the term on the right must be the $\\beta$ quantile of the standard normal distribution, which is $z_\\beta = -z_{1-\\beta}$.\n$$ \\frac{C - \\Delta}{SE_A} = -z_{1-\\beta} \\implies C = \\Delta - z_{1-\\beta} SE_A $$\n$$ C = (p_1 - p_2) - z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}{n}} $$\n\n**Solving for Sample Size $n$**\nWe now have two expressions for the critical value $C$. By equating them, we can solve for $n$:\n$$ z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}{n}} = (p_1 - p_2) - z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{\\frac{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}{n}} $$\nRearranging to group terms with $1/\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$ (p_1 - p_2) = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})}}{\\sqrt{n}} + z_{1-\\beta} \\frac{\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}}{\\sqrt{n}} $$\n$$ \\sqrt{n} (p_1-p_2) = z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)} $$\nIsolating $\\sqrt{n}$ and squaring both sides yields the formula for the per-group sample size $n$:\n$$ n = \\left( \\frac{z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} + z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)}}{p_1 - p_2} \\right)^2 $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nThe given values are:\n-   $p_1 = 0.45$, $p_2 = 0.25$, so $\\Delta = p_1 - p_2 = 0.20$.\n-   $\\alpha = 0.05 \\implies z_{1-\\alpha/2} = z_{0.975} = 1.9600$.\n-   $1-\\beta = 0.8 \\implies \\beta = 0.2 \\implies z_{1-\\beta} = z_{0.8} = 0.8416$.\n\nFirst, we compute the necessary components, rounding intermediate calculations to four significant figures as instructed.\n1.  Average proportion: $\\bar{p} = \\frac{0.45+0.25}{2} = 0.35$.\n2.  Variance components under $H_a$:\n    -   $p_1(1-p_1) = 0.45(0.55) = 0.2475$.\n    -   $p_2(1-p_2) = 0.25(0.75) = 0.1875$.\n    -   Sum of variances: $p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2) = 0.2475 + 0.1875 = 0.4350$.\n3.

Square roots of variance terms:\n    -   $\\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} = \\sqrt{0.4550} \\approx 0.6745$.\n    -   $\\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)} = \\sqrt{0.4350} \\approx 0.6595$.\n2.  Numerator terms:\n    -   $z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\sqrt{2\\bar{p}(1-\\bar{p})} \\approx 1.9600 \\times 0.6745 = 1.32202 \\approx 1.322$.\n    -   $z_{1-\\beta} \\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1) + p_2(1-p_2)} \\approx 0.8416 \\times 0.6595 = 0.5550272 \\approx 0.5550$.\n3.  Sum of numerator terms:\n    -   $1.322 + 0.5550 = 1.877$.\n\nNow, we compute $\\sqrt{n}$:\n$$ \\sqrt{n} = \\frac{1.877}{0.20} = 9.385 $$\n\nFinally, we compute $n$:\n$$ n = (9.385)^2 = 88.078225 \\approx 88.08 $$\nSince the number of patients must be an integer, we apply the ceiling function to ensure the required power is met or exceeded.\n$$ n_{required} = \\lceil 88.08 \\rceil = 89 $$\nThus, a sample size of $89$ patients per group is required.",
