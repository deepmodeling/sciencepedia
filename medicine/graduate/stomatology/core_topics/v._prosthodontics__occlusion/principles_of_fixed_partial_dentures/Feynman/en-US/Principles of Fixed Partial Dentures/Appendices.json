            "problem": "A clinician plans a three-unit Fixed Partial Denture (FPD) with a mandibular first premolar abutment that has compromised coronal tooth structure. The design principle of a ferrule requires a continuous band of sound tooth wall circumferentially engaged by the crown margin. Let the remaining ferrule height be the axial distance of sound coronal tooth structure above the planned finish line. Assume the following biologically and mechanically plausible conditions and data.\n\nThe remaining coronal tooth structure height above the current planned finish line is $h = 0.9$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. A surgical crown lengthening is planned that apically repositions the gingival margin and the alveolar crest in a manner that preserves the supracrestal tissue attachment, yielding an additional axial wall height of $\\Delta h = 1.3$ $\\mathrm{mm}$ above the crown margin after healing. The recommended minimum ferrule height for an abutment for an FPD is $F_{\\mathrm{req}} = 2.0$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. The supracrestal tissue attachment (historically termed biologic width) is maintained at its preoperative thickness by equal apical repositioning of the alveolar crest when the margin is moved apically, so that crown lengthening does not encroach upon attachment.\n\nPreoperatively, the alveolar bone support length from the root apex to the alveolar crest is $B_{0} = 12.8$ $\\mathrm{mm}$, and the clinical crown length from the occlusal surface (or incisal edge) to the gingival margin is $C_{0} = 9.6$ $\\mathrm{mm}$. Assume no orthodontic extrusion and that the crown margin is placed at the healed gingival margin (equigingival), so that the planned crown lengthening increases the clinical crown length exactly by $\\Delta h$ and decreases the alveolar bone support length exactly by $\\Delta h$.\n\nUsing only core definitions and principles of ferrule function and supracrestal tissue attachment preservation, determine whether the recommended ferrule height can be achieved after the planned crown lengthening, and compute the resulting crown-root ratio defined as the ratio of clinical crown length to alveolar bone support length after healing. Express the final crown-root ratio value as a decimal and round your answer to four significant figures. No unit is required in the final numeric answer.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All provided data and definitions are consistent with established principles in prosthodontics and periodontics. The problem can be solved directly from the given information.\n\nThe solution process involves two distinct calculations: first, determining if the required ferrule height is achieved, and second, calculating the final crown-root ratio after the surgical procedure.\n\n**Part 1: Validation of Ferrule Height**\n\nThe ferrule effect is achieved by a continuous band of sound tooth structure that is engaged by the crown. The height of this band is critical for the fracture resistance of the crowned tooth.\n\nThe initial height of the remaining sound coronal tooth structure above the planned finish line is given as $h = 0.9 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\nA surgical crown lengthening procedure is performed to expose more tooth structure. This procedure yields an additional axial wall height of $\\Delta h = 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nThe total available ferrule height, $F_{\\mathrm{total}}$, after the procedure is the sum of the initial height and the height gained from crown lengthening.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} = h + \\Delta h$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} = 0.9 \\ \\mathrm{mm} + 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe recommended minimum ferrule height for an abutment for a Fixed Partial Denture (FPD) is given as $F_{\\mathrm{req}} = 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nTo determine if the requirement is met, we compare the total available ferrule height to the required height:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{total}} \\ge F_{\\mathrm{req}}$$\n$$2.2 \\ \\mathrm{mm} \\ge 2.0 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\nSince this inequality is true, the recommended ferrule height can be achieved after the planned crown lengthening procedure.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Final Crown-Root Ratio**\n\nThe crown-root ratio is a prognostic factor for the long-term stability of a tooth, especially one serving as an abutment. It is defined in this problem as the ratio of the clinical crown length to the alveolar bone support length. We must calculate the final values for both lengths after the procedure.\n\nThe preoperative clinical crown length is $C_{0} = 9.6 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The problem states that the crown lengthening procedure increases the clinical crown length by the amount of newly exposed tooth structure, $\\Delta h$.\nThe final clinical crown length, $C_{\\mathrm{final}}$, is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{final}} = C_{0} + \\Delta h$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{final}} = 9.6 \\ \\mathrm{mm} + 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 10.9 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe preoperative alveolar bone support length (the portion of the root embedded in bone) is $B_{0} = 12.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$. The problem specifies that to preserve the supracrestal tissue attachment, the alveolar crest is repositioned apically by the same amount as the gingival margin, $\\Delta h$. This remodeling reduces the length of the root supported by bone.\nThe final alveolar bone support length, $B_{\\mathrm{final}}$, is:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{final}} = B_{0} - \\Delta h$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{final}} = 12.8 \\ \\mathrm{mm} - 1.3 \\ \\mathrm{mm} = 11.5 \\ \\mathrm{mm}$$\n\nThe final crown-root ratio, $R_{C/R}$, is the ratio of the final clinical crown length to the final alveolar bone support length.\n$$R_{C/R} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{final}}}{B_{\\mathrm{final}}}$$\nSubstituting the calculated final lengths:\n$$R_{C/R} = \\frac{10.9}{11.5}$$\nPerforming the division to obtain a decimal value:\n$$R_{C/R} \\approx 0.94782608...$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $9$, $4$, $7$, and $8$. The fifth significant figure is $2$, which is less than $5$, so we round down (i.e., truncate).\n$$R_{C/R} \\approx 0.9478$$\nThis ratio is often expressed as approximately $1:1.055$, which is close to the biomechanically acceptable limit of $1:1$ for a single crown or FPD abutment under favorable conditions.",

Ante’s law, as stated in the problem, requires that the total effective pericemental root surface area of the abutment teeth must be equal to or greater than the total baseline pericemental root surface area of the teeth being replaced.\n\nLet $A_{req}$ be the required total root surface area. This is calculated by summing the baseline areas of the three teeth being replaced: the first premolar, the second premolar, and the first molar.\n$$\nA_{req} = A_{\\text{1st premolar}} + A_{\\text{2nd premolar}} + A_{\\text{1st molar}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nA_{req} = 275 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} + 260 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} + 600 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} = 1135 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nThe total area to be supported by the abutments is $1135 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the effective pericemental root surface area for each abutment tooth. The model provided is $A_{eff} = A_{base} \\times (1 - b)$, where $A_{base}$ is the baseline area and $b$ is the fraction of periodontal bone support loss.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total effective area provided by the two proposed initial abutments: the canine and the second molar.\n\nFor the canine:\n$A_{base, \\text{canine}} = 300 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$\n$b_{\\text{canine}} = 0.15$\n$$\nA_{eff, \\text{canine}} = 300 \\times (1 - 0.15) = 300 \\times 0.85 = 255 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\n\nFor the second molar:\n$A_{base, \\text{2nd molar}} = 550 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$\n$b_{\\text{2nd molar}} = 0.10$\n$$\nA_{eff, \\text{2nd molar}} = 550 \\times (1 - 0.10) = 550 \\times 0.90 = 495 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\n\nThe total effective area from the initial abutments, $A_{initial}$, is the sum of their individual effective areas:\n$$\nA_{initial} = A_{eff, \\text{canine}} + A_{eff, \\text{2nd molar}} = 255 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} + 495 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} = 750 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\n\nWe now check if Ante’s law is satisfied with the initial abutments by comparing $A_{initial}$ to $A_{req}$:\n$$\n750 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} < 1135 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nSince the initial abutment area is less than the required area, Ante's law is not satisfied.

Third molar: $360 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$\n2. Lateral incisor: $180 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$\n3. Central incisor: $161.5 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$\n\nWe add abutments one by one, starting with the one that provides the most area, until the deficit of $385 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$ is met.\n\nAdding $1$ abutment: We select the third molar, which contributes $360 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}$.\n$$\n360 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} < 385 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nOne additional abutment is insufficient.\n\nAdding $2$ abutments: We select the two abutments with the highest effective areas: the third molar and the lateral incisor. Their combined contribution is:\n$$\nA_{added} = A_{eff, \\text{3rd molar}} + A_{eff, \\text{lat incisor}} = 360 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} + 180 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} = 540 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nWe check if this added area covers the deficit:\n$$\n540 \\,\\text{mm}^{2} \\ge 385 \\,\\text{mm}^{2}\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied. Therefore, adding these two teeth is sufficient.\n\nSince the addition of the single most effective abutment was insufficient, and the addition of the two most effective abutments is sufficient, the smallest integer number of additional abutments required is $2$.",

This allows for a ratiometric analysis. The information is internally consistent.\n\n5.  **Feasibility**: The conditions described are physically plausible within the context of designing a dental prosthesis. An increase of $20$ percent in a dimension of a few millimeters is a realistic design modification.\n\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe maximum elastic deflection, $\\delta$, of a beam under a given load is governed by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. For any linear elastic beam with constant cross-section, the deflection is inversely proportional to the flexural rigidity, $EI$, where $E$ is the elastic modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the cross-section. This relationship can be expressed generally as:\n$$ \\delta = C \\frac{1}{EI} $$\nHere, the constant of proportionality, $C$, depends on the span length $L$, the boundary conditions (i.e., how the beam is supported at its ends), and the magnitude and distribution of the applied load. The problem states that the span $L$, the elastic modulus $E$, and the loading pattern and magnitude remain constant. Therefore, the factor $C$ is constant for the two scenarios being compared.\n\nThe second moment of area, $I$, for the rectangular cross-section is given as:\n$$ I = \\frac{b t^{3}}{12} $$\nwhere $b$ is the width and $t$ is the thickness.\n\nLet the initial state of the connector be denoted by subscript $1$ and the final state (after the thickness increase) by subscript $2$.\n\nIn the initial state, the thickness is $t_1$, and the second moment of area is $I_1$:\n$$ I_1 = \\frac{b t_1^3}{12} $$\nThe maximum deflection in the initial state, $\\delta_1$, is:\n$$ \\delta_1 = C \\frac{1}{EI_1} = C \\frac{1}{E \\left( \\frac{b t_1^3}{12} \\right)} = \\frac{12C}{E b t_1^3} $$\n\nIn the final state, the thickness, $t_2$, is increased by $20$ percent relative to the initial thickness, $t_1$.\n$$ t_2 = t_1 + 0.20 t_1 = 1.20 t_1 $$\nThe width $b$ remains constant. The new second moment of area, $I_2$, is:\n$$ I_2 = \\frac{b t_2^3}{12} = \\frac{b (1.20 t_1)^3}{12} = \\frac{b (1.20^3) t_1^3}{12} $$\nThe maximum deflection in the final state, $\\delta_2$, is:\n$$ \\delta_2 = C \\frac{1}{EI_2} = C \\frac{1}{E \\left( \\frac{b (1.20)^3 t_1^3}{12} \\right)} = \\frac{12C}{E b (1.20)^3 t_1^3} $$\n\nTo find the relationship between the final and initial deflections, we can take the ratio $\\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\frac{\\frac{12C}{E b (1.20)^3 t_1^3}}{\\frac{12C}{E b t_1^3}} $$\nAll common terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\frac{1}{(1.20)^3} $$\nLet's calculate the value of $(1.20)^3$:\n$$ (1.20)^3 = 1.20 \\times 1.20 \\times 1.20 = 1.44 \\times 1.20 = 1.728 $$\nSo, the ratio of the deflections is:\n$$ \\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = \\frac{1}{1.728} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the reduction in deflection, expressed as a decimal fraction. The reduction is the difference between the initial and final deflections, $\\delta_1 - \\delta_2$. The fractional reduction is this difference divided by the original deflection, $\\delta_1$:\n$$ \\text{Reduction} = \\frac{\\delta_1 - \\delta_2}{\\delta_1} = 1 - \\frac{\\delta_2}{\\delta_1} $$\nSubstituting the value of the ratio we found:\n$$ \\text{Reduction} = 1 - \\frac{1}{1.728} $$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1.728} \\approx 0.5787037037... $$\nFinally, we calculate the reduction:\n$$ \\text{Reduction} = 1 - 0.5787037037... = 0.4212962962... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Reduction} \\approx 0.4213 $$\nThis corresponds to a $42.13$ percent reduction in the maximum deflection.",
