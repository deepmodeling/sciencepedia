This practice moves beyond qualitative judgment to a quantitative framework, helping you translate the abstract \"reasonable patient standard\" into a concrete calculation.

            "problem": "A clinician in dental practice is preparing a patient for a mandibular third molar extraction. In keeping with the principle of respect for patient autonomy and the doctrine of informed consent, the clinician must disclose risks that are ethically and legally material under the reasonable patient standard. Materiality, in this setting, is grounded in the notion that a reasonable patient would attach significance to a risk when its expected disutility is non-negligible, jointly considering the probability of occurrence and the severity of its impact on function and well-being.\n\nSuppose the procedure carries a documented risk of transient paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve with probability $2\\%$, and the severity of this outcome has been normatively assessed on a $[0,1]$ scale as $0.7$, where $0$ represents a trivial inconvenience and $1$ represents maximal functional loss. The institutional policy has adopted a disclosure threshold based on an expected-disutility materiality index $m$ such that disclosure is indicated whenever $m \\ge 0.01$.\n\nUsing first principles from decision theory (expected disutility) consistent with the reasonable patient standard in tort law and the ethical duty to inform, compute the materiality index $m$ for the transient paresthesia outcome from these inputs and determine whether disclosure is indicated under the threshold $m \\ge 0.01$. Report the computed value of $m$ as a dimensionless decimal (do not use a percentage sign). Your final answer must be the single computed value of $m$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the computation of a materiality index, denoted by $m$, for a specific risk in a dental procedure and a determination of whether disclosure is indicated based on a given threshold. The problem is grounded in the principles of decision theory and medical ethics, specifically the concept of informed consent.\n\nFirst, I will validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Risk: Transient paresthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve.\n-   Probability of occurrence, $P$: $2\\%$.\n-   Severity of the outcome, $S$: $0.7$ on a $[0, 1]$ scale.\n-   Definition of materiality index, $m$: Based on expected disutility, jointly considering probability and severity.\n-   Disclosure threshold: Disclosure is indicated whenever $m \\ge 0.01$.\n-   Required output: The computed value of $m$ as a dimensionless decimal.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The concept of expected utility (or disutility) is a cornerstone of decision theory, a well-established field in mathematics and economics. Its application to medical ethics and legal standards of informed consent (the \"reasonable patient\" standard) is a standard and rigorous way to formalize qualitative principles.\n-   **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary inputs and a clear objective. The materiality index $m$ is described as being based on expected disutility, which, for a single probabilistic event, is universally defined as the product of the probability of the event and its utility (or disutility/severity). The inputs ($P$ and $S$) are sufficient to compute $m$.\n-   **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative terms and definitions, avoiding any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\nThe problem passes all validation criteria. It is a valid, solvable problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem defines the materiality index $m$ as a measure of expected disutility. In decision theory, the expected value of an outcome is the product of its probability and its value. Here, the \"value\" is the severity of the outcome, which represents its disutility.\n\nLet $P$ be the probability of the adverse outcome (transient paresthesia).\nLet $S$ be the severity of that outcome, representing its disutility.\n\nThe materiality index $m$ is the expected disutility, which is calculated as:\n$$m = P \\times S$$\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\nThe probability of occurrence is $P = 2\\%$. To be used in the calculation, this percentage must be expressed as a dimensionless number:\n$$P = \\frac{2}{100} = 0.02$$\n\nThe severity of the outcome is given on a normalized scale as:\n$$S = 0.7$$\n\nNow, I will substitute these values into the formula for the materiality index $m$:\n$$m = 0.02 \\times 0.7$$\n\nPerforming the multiplication:\n$$m = 0.014$$\n\nThe computed materiality index for the risk of transient paresthesia is $m = 0.014$.\n\nThe problem also requires a determination of whether disclosure is indicated. The institutional policy mandates disclosure if the materiality index $m$ is greater than or equal to a threshold of $0.01$. The condition for disclosure is:\n$$m \\ge 0.01$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated value of $m$:\n$$0.014 \\ge 0.01$$\n\nThis inequality is true. Therefore, under the specified institutional policy, the risk of transient paresthesia is considered material, and its disclosure to the patient is indicated.\n\nThe problem, however, asks for the final answer to be the single computed value of $m$.",

This exercise presents a critical and common scenario: a patient verbally agrees they understand the risks of refusing treatment, but their own words reveal a profound misunderstanding . This practice challenges you to recognize the gap between disclosure and comprehension, and to deploy evidence-based communication strategies, such as the teach-back method and the use of natural frequencies, to ensure a patient's decision is truly informed.",

            "problem": "A competent adult patient with chronic symptomatic pericoronitis is advised to undergo a minor surgical procedure. You disclose that the risk of a significant adverse outcome if the condition is left untreated in the next year is $5\\%$. The patient verbally refuses the procedure, stating they understand the risks but then paraphrases the risk as $0.5\\%$ and explains their refusal is based on believing the chance of a bad outcome is \"one in two hundred.\" Assume there is no coercion, the patient demonstrates decision-making capacity, and the recommended treatment aligns with accepted clinical standards. Using first principles from dental ethics and jurisprudence, determine whether this refusal currently qualifies as informed and, if not, identify the most appropriate intervention to correct the misunderstanding before accepting the refusal.\n\nBase your reasoning on the core elements of informed consent/informed refusal (capacity, disclosure, understanding, voluntariness, and authorization/refusal), the concept of material risk under the reasonable patient standard for disclosure, and scientifically sound risk communication practices. As part of your reasoning, convert the disclosed probability and the patient's stated probability into natural frequencies and quantify the magnitude of the misestimation. Then select the single best course of action.\n\nWhich option is the most appropriate?\n\nA.

Determine if the refusal qualifies as informed.\n    2. If not, identify the most appropriate intervention.\n    3. Base reasoning on the core elements of informed consent/refusal (capacity, disclosure, understanding, voluntariness, authorization/refusal), the concept of material risk, and sound risk communication.\n    4. Quantify the misestimation by converting probabilities to natural frequencies.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is grounded in the established legal and ethical principles of informed consent, which are cornerstones of medical and dental practice. The use of probabilities and the assessment of patient understanding are standard components of this doctrine. The clinical scenario is realistic.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear scenario and a set of principles to apply. It asks for a determination and a subsequent course of action, which can be logically derived from the given information and principles. The required calculations are well-defined.\n- **Objective:** The language is neutral and descriptive, presenting a factual scenario without subjective bias.\n- **Flaw Check:**\n    1. **Scientific/Factual Unsoundness:** None.

The topic is directly relevant to dental ethics and jurisprudence.\n    3. **Incomplete/Contradictory Setup:** The problem appears to contain a tension between \"competent adult\" with \"decision-making capacity\" and the patient's clear misunderstanding. This is not a contradiction but the central point of the problem. General decision-making capacity does not guarantee understanding of specific, complex information. The problem is designed to test the distinction between general capacity and task-specific understanding.\n    4. **Unrealistic/Infeasible:** The scenario is highly realistic. Patient misunderstanding of numerical risk information is a well-documented phenomenon in health communication.\n    5. **Ill-Posed/Poorly Structured:** None.

The reasoning can be verified against established standards of care and ethical guidelines.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe core of this problem lies in the ethical and legal doctrine of informed consent, which also governs informed refusal. The five essential elements are: capacity, disclosure, understanding, voluntariness, and authorization/refusal.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Informed Consent Elements:**\n    - **Capacity:** The problem states the patient is a \"competent adult\" and \"demonstrates decision-making capacity.\" This element is stipulated as being met.\n    - **Disclosure:** The practitioner disclosed a $5\\%$ risk of a significant adverse outcome. A $5\\%$ chance of a \"significant\" outcome is undoubtedly a material risk under the \"reasonable patient\" standard (i.e., information a reasonable person would consider important in their decision-making). This element is met.\n    - **Voluntariness:** The problem states there is \"no coercion.\" This element is met.\n    - **Understanding:** This is the element that is clearly deficient. The practitioner disclosed a risk of $P_{\\text{disclosed}} = 5\\%$. The patient has internalized and is basing their decision on a perceived risk of $P_{\\text{patient}} = 0.5\\%$. This demonstrates a failure of understanding. An \"informed\" decision must be based on a reasonable grasp of the disclosed information. A decision based on critically flawed information is, by definition, not informed.\n    - **Refusal:** The patient has provided a verbal refusal. This is the act of decision.\n\n2.  **Quantitative Analysis of the Misunderstanding:**\n    - The disclosed probability is $P_{\\text{disclosed}} = 5\\% = 0.05$. As a natural frequency, this is $\\frac{5}{100}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{20}$. Thus, the risk is \"$1$ in $20$\".\n    - The patient's stated probability is $P_{\\text{patient}} = 0.5\\% = 0.005$. As a natural frequency, this is $\\frac{0.5}{100}$ or $\\frac{5}{1000}$, which simplifies to $\\frac{1}{200}$. Thus, the patient believes the risk is \"$1$ in $200$\", which matches their verbal statement.\n    - The magnitude of the underestimation is the ratio of the actual risk to the perceived risk:\n      $$ \\text{Factor of underestimation} = \\frac{P_{\\text{disclosed}}}{P_{\\text{patient}}} = \\frac{5\\%}{0.5\\%} = \\frac{0.05}{0.005} = 10 $$\n    - The patient is underestimating a material risk by a factor of $10$. This is not a negligible error; it is a profound misunderstanding of the clinical situation.\n\n3.  **Determining the Appropriate Intervention:**\n    - Since the refusal is not informed due to a lack of understanding, the practitioner has an ethical duty to try to correct the misunderstanding before accepting the refusal. Simply documenting the flawed refusal (as suggested in option B) would not meet the standard of care.\n    - The practitioner's goal is to facilitate genuine understanding, which empowers patient autonomy. It is not to coerce the patient into accepting treatment.\n    - Scientifically supported risk communication practices are required. These include:\n        - **Teach-Back Method:** Asking the patient to explain the information in their own words. This is the gold standard for assessing and confirming understanding.\n        - **Using Natural Frequencies:** Stating risk as \"$1$ in $20$\" is often more intuitive than \"$5\\%$\". Explicitly contrasting \"$1$ in $20$\" with the patient's \"$1$ in $200$\" can powerfully illustrate the magnitude of the misunderstanding.\n        - **Chunk-and-Check:** Breaking down information and verifying understanding at each step.\n        - **Plain Language and Visual Aids:** Avoiding jargon and using simple diagrams or charts can improve comprehension.\n    - Overriding the patient's decision (Option E) is a violation of their autonomy and constitutes battery. A patient with capacity has the right to refuse treatment, even if that refusal is medically unwise, as long as the refusal is *informed*. The current task is to ensure it becomes informed.\n    - Dismissing the error as negligible (Option C) is factually incorrect.\n    - Relying on an outdated or misunderstood interpretation of the professional standard (Option D) is insufficient; the core of informed consent is genuine understanding.\n\n    Therefore, the most appropriate intervention is a structured effort to re-educate the patient respectfully, using evidence-based communication techniques to bridge the gap in understanding.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The refusal is not informed because the patient’s underestimation of a disclosed material risk by a factor of $10$ indicates a lack of understanding; use a structured teach-back: reframe $5\\%$ as “$1$ in $20$” (contrasting with $0.5\\%$ as “$1$ in $200$”), present information in plain language with visual aids, chunk-and-check understanding, ask the patient to explain in their own words the risks, benefits, and alternatives, correct errors, reconfirm the decision, and contemporaneously document the conversation and patient responses.**\n- **Analysis:** This option correctly identifies that the refusal is not informed due to a lack of understanding. It correctly calculates the underestimation factor of $10$. The proposed intervention package—teach-back, natural frequencies (\"$1$ in $20$\" vs. \"$1$ in $200$\"), plain language, visual aids, chunk-and-check, and thorough documentation—represents the best practices in risk communication and fulfilling the ethical duty to ensure understanding. It respects patient autonomy by aiming to create the conditions for a truly informed decision, rather than forcing a particular outcome.\n- **Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. The refusal is informed because the patient has capacity and expressed a number; respect autonomy by proceeding without further counseling and simply document the refusal.**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect. It conflates the general state of 'capacity' with the specific 'understanding' required for a particular decision. The patient expressed a number that was factually wrong by an order of magnitude, which is direct evidence of a lack of understanding. Accepting a decision based on such a significant misunderstanding is a failure to truly respect patient autonomy.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**C. The misestimation is negligible; provide additional statistics such as odds ratios, avoid teach-back to prevent embarrassment, obtain a signed refusal, and proceed.**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect. An underestimation by a factor of $10$ for a material risk is significant, not negligible. Introducing more complex statistics like odds ratios would likely increase confusion for a patient already struggling with percentages. Avoiding teach-back out of a misplaced fear of embarrassment is a dereliction of the duty to ensure comprehension.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**D. Under the professional practice standard, a patient’s ability to recite any numeric risk suffices to establish understanding; accept the refusal without correction, as the dentist has already disclosed the $5\\%$ figure.**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect. First, the patient did *not* recite the correct numeric risk. Second, modern jurisprudence has largely shifted from the 'professional practice' standard (what a reasonable doctor would disclose) to the 'reasonable patient' standard (what a reasonable patient would want to know). In either case, the core of the doctrine is about meaningful understanding, not the rote mechanical act of disclosure or recitation.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. Require the patient to pass a written numeracy test; if they fail, override the refusal and proceed with treatment in the patient’s best interests, documenting the lack of numeracy as justification.**\n- **Analysis:** This is incorrect and ethically dangerous. Forcing a test is paternalistic and non-standard. Most egregiously, overriding the refusal of a competent adult patient is illegal and unethical (it constitutes battery). Beneficence (acting in the patient's best interest) does not trump the autonomy of a patient with decision-making capacity. The proper response to low health numeracy is enhanced communication, not the revocation of a patient's rights.\n- **Verdict:** Incorrect.",

This exercise guides you through a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA) of a wrong-site surgery, a quintessential patient safety failure .

            "problem": "A patient in a general dental practice presents for extraction of a mandibular first molar with a symptomatic periapical lesion. The referral letter from the endodontist correctly identifies the tooth and a cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scan is available. On the day of treatment, a busy schedule, overlapping appointments, and late arrival of sterilized instrument packs lead the team to skip their pre-procedure verification checklist. The consent form signed the same day lists a different tooth from a prior plan revision that was never updated in the electronic record. During local anesthesia, the assistant misidentifies the tooth based on an old chart note, and the operator proceeds with extraction. After removal, the operator notices a mismatch between the clinical presentation and the extracted tooth. The practice decides to undertake a structured analysis and quality improvement.\n\nFrom the standpoint of the principles of biomedical ethics (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, justice), the legal doctrine of informed consent (disclosure, comprehension, voluntariness, competence), and core patient-safety science (e.g., the Swiss Cheese Model), a comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in a dental setting must systematically address system factors, human factors, and latent conditions, and it must be implemented in a manner consistent with dental jurisprudence, including confidentiality and reporting obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and quality-assurance privilege where applicable.\n\nWhich option most accurately constructs such an RCA framework tailored to dental practice and sets out implementation steps that align with ethical and legal obligations, including patient disclosure and informed consent for corrective care?\n\nA. Framework: Classify contributing causes across system factors (e.g., scheduling pressure, absence of standardized verification protocols, electronic record configuration, sterile supply logistics), human factors (e.g., miscommunication, confirmation bias, fatigue, authority gradient), and latent conditions (e.g., production targets, training gaps, policy ambiguity). Implementation: Immediately ensure patient safety; disclose the adverse event to the patient with an apology consistent with applicable apology statutes; provide a clear explanation of what is known and unknown; obtain informed consent for any corrective treatment using enhanced shared decision-making and teach-back to confirm understanding; convene a multidisciplinary non-punitive RCA team; secure and de-identify records for analysis under quality-assurance privilege while maintaining HIPAA compliance; construct a detailed event timeline and process map; employ barrier analysis and a Swiss Cheese Model perspective to identify path vulnerabilities; prioritize countermeasures using a hierarchy of controls (elimination, substitution, engineering, administrative, training), revise policies (e.g., standardized time-out and consent reconciliation), implement team training and simulation, monitor outcomes with Continuous Quality Improvement (CQI) metrics, and include near-miss reporting and, where required, external reporting.\n\nB. Framework: Focus on clinician negligence as the primary cause, with secondary emphasis on assistant performance; treat system issues as minor. Implementation: Delay patient disclosure until completion of legal review; obtain a blanket consent allowing any necessary future procedures; conduct a brief internal interview led solely by the practice owner; assign remedial training to involved staff; document disciplinary actions; close the case after training is completed and avoid collecting data on near misses to reduce liability exposure.\n\nC. Framework: Emphasize technology fixes (e.g., barcode scanning of instruments and dual-signature digital forms) as the central solution; assume human factors are fully mitigated by technology; consider latent conditions immaterial. Implementation: Restrict RCA to cases with severe harm; maintain strict confidentiality by prohibiting disclosure to the patient until the corrective technology is installed; rely on liability waivers and indemnity language in consent forms to preclude claims; avoid policy changes to preserve workflow; do not involve frontline staff to prevent bias.\n\nD. Framework: Identify the immediate error as a simple staff lapse; disregard system and latent contributors to avoid overcomplicating the analysis. Implementation: File a short incident report; issue a practice-wide memo reminding accuracy in charting; obtain consent for corrective care via a brief telephone call; publicly post the names of involved staff to deter future mistakes; skip team formation and formal analysis to prevent disruption; refrain from external reporting and follow-up measurement to minimize reputational risk.",

The concepts cited—RCA, the Swiss Cheese Model, the principles of biomedical ethics, and HIPAA—are standard and foundational in modern healthcare. The scenario of a wrong-site surgery is a known, well-studied type of medical error. The problem is scientifically and factually sound within its domain.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a detailed case study and a clear set of established principles against which to evaluate the proposed solutions. The question asks for the \"most accurate\" option, implying a comparative analysis is required to find the single best fit. This structure allows for a unique and meaningful solution.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem statement is a factual description of a hypothetical event. It avoids subjective or biased language. The criteria for evaluation (ethics, law, safety science) are objective professional standards.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-structured, objective, and scientifically grounded problem in the domain of healthcare systems and ethics. The solution process can proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nA comprehensive Root Cause Analysis (RCA) framework, as stipulated, must move beyond assigning individual blame to analyze the systemic vulnerabilities that allowed the error to occur. The implementation of this analysis must adhere to strict ethical and legal standards.\n\nLet us define the core components of the required analysis:\n*   **Causal Factors:** A modern RCA framework must analyze System Factors ($SF$), Human Factors ($HF$), and Latent Conditions ($LC$). An error event $E$ is a function of the alignment of failures across these domains, as conceptualized in the Swiss Cheese Model ($SCM$). $E = f(SF_i, HF_j, LC_k)$. A purely blame-oriented analysis focusing only on the active failure of an individual (a single $HF_j$) is inadequate.\n*   **Ethical Principles:** The response must be guided by Nonmaleficence ($P_{NM}$, do no harm, secure the patient), Autonomy ($P_A$, respect the patient's right to know and decide), Beneficence ($P_B$, act in the patient's best interest, improve the system), and Justice ($P_J$, ensure a fair, non-punitive process).\n*   **Legal Doctrines:** The process must comply with legal requirements for patient Confidentiality (e.g., HIPAA), disclosure of adverse events, and obtaining valid Informed Consent ($IC$) for any subsequent treatment. It may also leverage legal protections like Quality-Assurance ($QA$) privilege.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against this ideal model.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**Option A:**\n\n*   **Framework:** This option proposes classifying causes into System Factors ($SF$), Human Factors ($HF$), and Latent Conditions ($LC$), providing examples that directly map to the incident (scheduling pressure, no verification protocol, etc.). This perfectly reflects a modern, systems-based RCA and the $SCM$ philosophy.\n*   **Implementation:** The steps are logically sequenced and ethically/legally sound.\n    1.  `Immediately ensure patient safety` — Adheres to $P_{NM}$.\n    2.  `disclose the adverse event to the patient with an apology` — Fulfills the primary ethical duty of honesty, central to $P_A$. Acknowledges apology statutes.\n    3.  `obtain informed consent for any corrective treatment using enhanced shared decision-making` — Correctly applies the doctrine of $IC$ for new procedures, upholding $P_A$.\n    4.  `convene a multidisciplinary non-punitive RCA team` — Aligns with $P_J$ and is a best practice for effective, unbiased analysis.\n    5.  `secure and de-identify records for analysis under quality-assurance privilege while maintaining HIPAA compliance` — Demonstrates a correct understanding of medico-legal procedures.\n    6.  The subsequent steps (`event timeline`, `process map`, `barrier analysis`, `hierarchy of controls`, `policy revision`, `team training`, `CQI metrics`, `near-miss reporting`) constitute a textbook, gold-standard quality improvement cycle. This entire process is designed for $P_B$, aiming to genuinely improve the system and prevent recurrence.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Correct**. This option provides a comprehensive, accurate, and state-of-the-art framework and implementation plan that aligns with all principles stipulated in the problem.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n*   **Framework:** `Focus on clinician negligence as the primary cause`. This is a \"person model\" of error, not a \"system model.\" It fundamentally contradicts the philosophy of $RCA$ and the $SCM$. It focuses on blame rather than learning.\n*   **Implementation:**\n    1.  `Delay patient disclosure until legal review` — Violates the ethical principle of $P_A$ (honesty and timely communication).\n    2.  `obtain a blanket consent` — Legally and ethically invalid. $IC$ must be specific to a procedure.\n    3.  `brief internal interview led solely by the practice owner` — This is not a multidisciplinary or non-punitive $RCA$; it is an interrogation. This violates $P_J$.\n    4.  `assign remedial training...document disciplinary actions` — A punitive approach that fosters a culture of fear and hiding mistakes, which is antithetical to patient safety improvement ($P_B$).\n    5.  `avoid collecting data on near misses` — Explicitly rejects a core tenet of proactive safety culture.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option describes an outdated, punitive, and ethically deficient response that fails to meet the core requirements of a modern $RCA$.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n*   **Framework:** `Emphasize technology fixes...as the central solution; assume human factors are fully mitigated by technology`. This is a common fallacy. Technology is a tool, not a panacea. It's a component of $SF$, but does not eliminate $HF$ or $LC$. A robust system integrates people, processes, and technology.\n*   **Implementation:**\n    1.  `prohibiting disclosure to the patient` — A severe violation of the ethical principle of $P_A$.\n    2.  `rely on liability waivers and indemnity language` — Ethically unsound and often legally unenforceable for negligence.\n    3.  `do not involve frontline staff to prevent bias` — This is a critical error. Frontline staff have the most knowledge of real-world workflows and are essential to a valid $RCA$. Excluding them guarantees the analysis will be flawed.\n    4.  `Restrict RCA to cases with severe harm` — Rejects the principle of learning from all errors and near misses to proactively improve safety.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option is based on a naive understanding of safety science and proposes unethical and ineffective implementation steps.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n*   **Framework:** `Identify the immediate error as a simple staff lapse; disregard system and latent contributors`. This is a superficial analysis that halts at the active failure, completely missing the point of an $RCA$.\n*   **Implementation:**\n    1.  `issue a practice-wide memo` — A notoriously weak and ineffective administrative control.\n    2.  `obtain consent...via a brief telephone call` — Fails to meet the legal and ethical standard for truly informed consent ($IC$), especially in a post-error context. This violates $P_A$.\n    3.  `publicly post the names of involved staff to deter future mistakes` — A grossly unethical, punitive action (\"name and shame\") that violates $P_J$ and professional decency. It would destroy psychological safety and guarantee future errors are hidden.\n    4.  `skip team formation and formal analysis` — This is an explicit refusal to conduct a proper $RCA$.\n\n*   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. This option describes a punitive, superficial, and counterproductive response that would worsen the practice's safety culture and fail all ethical and procedural standards.",
