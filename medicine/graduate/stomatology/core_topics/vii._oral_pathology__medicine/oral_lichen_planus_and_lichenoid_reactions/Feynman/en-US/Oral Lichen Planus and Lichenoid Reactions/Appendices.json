Pain is quantified using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS; 0 to 10). Visits occur at equal weekly intervals. High-potency topical corticosteroid therapy is initiated immediately after the evaluation at visit 3. The VAS pain scores recorded at each visit are:\n- Visit $1$: $8.0$\n- Visit $2$: $8.3$\n- Visit $3$ (therapy initiated immediately after this visit): $7.5$\n- Visit $4$: $6.2$\n- Visit $5$: $4.3$\n- Visit $6$: $3.1$\n\nAssume that, over the early post-initiation interval, the expected trajectory of pain reduction can be approximated as linear with respect to time.

            "introduction": "Clinical decisions often involve weighing the benefits of a primary therapy against the risks of side effects, such as the oral candidiasis induced by topical corticosteroids used for OLP. This exercise introduces the Number Needed to Treat (NNT), a key metric in clinical epidemiology that translates risk reduction into an intuitive figure. By calculating the NNT for antifungal prophylaxis, you will gain a practical understanding of how to evaluate the efficiency of a preventive intervention at the population level .",

            "problem": "A cohort of patients with oral lichen planus, a chronic T cell–mediated inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa, is managed with topical corticosteroids. Topical corticosteroids can predispose to oral candidiasis by altering local mucosal immunity and barrier function. An institutional protocol introduces antifungal prophylaxis concomitantly with corticosteroid therapy to mitigate Candida overgrowth. Over a fixed follow-up horizon of 8 weeks, surveillance shows that the proportion of patients developing new-onset candidiasis decreases from 30% in the absence of prophylaxis to 10% with prophylaxis, under otherwise comparable conditions. \n\nUsing only core epidemiological definitions appropriate for a closed cohort over a fixed time horizon—specifically the incidence proportion and the risk difference—derive, from first principles, the number needed to treat (NNT) for the antifungal prophylaxis to prevent one case of candidiasis within the 8-week horizon. State any assumptions required to connect these definitions to the NNT construct, and express the final NNT as a pure number with no units. No rounding is required unless your derivation produces a non-integer. If rounding becomes necessary, use significant figures.",
            "solution": "The derivation proceeds from the fundamental definitions provided in the problem statement.\n\n1.  **Incidence Proportion (IP):** The problem describes a closed cohort followed for a fixed period of 8 weeks. In this context, the \"proportion of patients developing new-onset candidiasis\" is formally defined as the incidence proportion, also known as cumulative incidence or risk. It is the ratio of new cases to the total number of individuals at risk at the beginning of the study period.\n    $$ \\text{IP} = \\frac{\\text{Number of new cases}}{\\text{Number of individuals at risk}} $$\n    The problem provides two incidence proportions:\n    -   The incidence proportion in the control group (no prophylaxis), $IP_C = 30% = 0.30$.\n    -   The incidence proportion in the treated group (with prophylaxis), $IP_T = 10% = 0.10$.\n\n2.  **Risk Difference (RD):** The risk difference is the absolute difference in risk between the control and treated groups. For a treatment that reduces risk, this is also referred to as the Absolute Risk Reduction (ARR). It is calculated as:\n    $$ \\text{RD} = IP_C - IP_T $$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$ \\text{RD} = 0.30 - 0.10 = 0.20 $$\n    This value, $0.20$, represents the proportion of the cohort that is spared from developing candidiasis due to the prophylactic intervention. In other words, for every $100$ patients treated with prophylaxis, $20$ additional cases of candidiasis are prevented compared to no treatment.\n\n3.  **Number Needed to Treat (NNT):** The NNT is conceptually defined as the average number of patients who must receive the treatment for one patient to benefit (i.e., to prevent one adverse outcome). This can be derived from the risk difference. If a risk difference of RD prevents an outcome in RD proportion of the treated population, then the number of people one needs to treat to prevent one single outcome is the reciprocal of this proportion.\n    Let $N$ be the number of patients treated. The number of events prevented in this group is $N \\times \\text{RD}$. To find the number of patients needed to prevent exactly one event, we set this equal to $1$:\n    $$ N_{\\text{to prevent 1}} \\times \\text{RD} = 1 $$\n    Solving for $N_{\\text{to prevent 1}}$, which is the NNT, yields:\n    $$ \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{\\text{RD}} $$\n    This is the formal definition of NNT derived from first principles.\n\n4.  **Calculation:**\n    Using the calculated risk difference, we find the NNT:\n    $$ \\text{NNT} = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5 $$\n\n### Assumptions\nThe derivation relies on the following assumptions, as required by the prompt:\n-   The cohort is truly closed, with no loss to follow-up that would bias the incidence proportion estimates.\n-   The condition that the groups are under \"otherwise comparable conditions\" is met, implying that the observed risk difference is attributable solely to the antifungal prophylaxis and not to confounding variables.\n-   The NNT is a population average. The calculation assumes that the risk reduction is uniform across all patients, which is a simplification inherent in the NNT metric.\n-   The risk difference observed in this specific cohort is a valid and unbiased estimate of the true risk difference in the broader population of similar patients.\n\nThe final answer is an integer and requires no rounding. The NNT is a pure number, representing a count of patients.",
