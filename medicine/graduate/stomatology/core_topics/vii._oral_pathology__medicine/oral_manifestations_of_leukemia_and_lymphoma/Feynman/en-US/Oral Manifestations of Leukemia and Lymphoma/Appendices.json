For patients with suspected or confirmed leukemia or lymphoma, profound immunosuppression is a primary concern. This practice focuses on a fundamental skill: quantifying neutropenia by calculating the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC), a critical step in assessing a patient's risk for life-threatening infections and determining the safety of proceeding with invasive dental care .",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Total White Blood Cell (WBC) count: $\\mathrm{WBC}=3{,}000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu L}^{-1}$\n-   Percentage of segmented neutrophils: $15\\%$\n-   Percentage of band forms: $2\\%$\n-   Definition: \"an absolute cell count equals the total count multiplied by the fraction of that lineage in the differential\"\n-   Task: Compute the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and use it to reason about the appropriateness of invasive dental procedures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The calculation of the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) is a standard and fundamental diagnostic procedure in hematology and general medicine. The given WBC count and differential percentages are clinically plausible for a patient with a hematologic malignancy. The definition of absolute count provided is correct. The principle that severe neutropenia is a contraindication for elective invasive procedures due to the risk of sepsis is a cornerstone of clinical practice. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for the calculation. It does not violate any scientific principles, nor does it contain any factual unsoundness, ambiguity, or contradiction.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) and a clinical interpretation of the result in the context of oral health management.\n\nThe given data are:\n-   Total White Blood Cell count, $C_{WBC} = 3000 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$.\n-   Percentage of segmented neutrophils, $P_{segs} = 15\\%$.\n-   Percentage of band forms (immature neutrophils), $P_{bands} = 2\\%$.\n\nThe total neutrophil population is the sum of mature (segmented) and immature (band) forms. Therefore, the total percentage of neutrophils, $P_{neutrophil}$, in the differential count is the sum of the percentages of these two cell types.\n\n$$P_{neutrophil} = P_{segs} + P_{bands}$$\n$$P_{neutrophil} = 15\\% + 2\\% = 17\\%$$\n\nTo calculate the ANC, we must use the fractional representation of this percentage. The fraction of neutrophils, $f_{neutrophil}$, is:\n\n$$f_{neutrophil} = \\frac{P_{neutrophil}}{100} = \\frac{17}{100} = 0.17$$\n\nFollowing the definition provided in the problem statement, the absolute cell count is the total count multiplied by the fraction of the specific cell lineage. Thus, the ANC is calculated as:\n\n$$\\text{ANC} = C_{WBC} \\times f_{neutrophil}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$$\\text{ANC} = 3000 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mathrm{\\mu L}} \\times 0.17$$\n$$\\text{ANC} = 510 \\, \\frac{\\text{cells}}{\\mathrm{\\mu L}}$$\n\nThe computed Absolute Neutrophil Count is $510$ cells per microliter.\n\nFor the clinical reasoning part of the question, we must compare this value to established clinical cutoffs for neutropenia. Neutropenia is generally graded by severity:\n-   Mild neutropenia: $\\text{ANC} < 1500 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$\n-   Moderate neutropenia: $\\text{ANC} < 1000 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$\n-   Severe neutropenia: $\\text{ANC} < 500 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$\n\nThe calculated $\\text{ANC}$ of $510 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$ places the patient in the moderate neutropenia category, bordering on severe neutropenia. The patient's clinical presentation includes painful oral ulcerations, gingival bleeding, and pseudomembranous lesions, which are classic signs of mucosal barrier breakdown secondary to immunosuppression. In a patient with such a low neutrophil count, the innate immune system's ability to combat bacterial invasion is critically impaired. Invasive dental procedures, such as tooth extractions or deep scaling, breach the already compromised oral mucosa, creating a direct portal for oral microbiota to enter the bloodstream. This can lead to bacteremia and life-threatening sepsis. Given the $\\text{ANC}$ of $510 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$ and the existing oral mucosal injury, standard clinical guidelines would strongly advise withholding all elective invasive dental procedures until the patient's neutrophil count has recovered to a safer level (typically $\\text{ANC} > 1000 \\, \\text{cells}/\\mathrm{\\mu L}$).\n\nThe final answer requested is the single numeric value of the computed ANC.",

An incisional biopsy shows a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the oral cavity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for Ki-67 demonstrates high proliferative activity. By definition, the Ki-67 protein is expressed in cells during all active phases of the cell cycle ($G_{1}$, $S$, $G_{2}$, and mitosis) but not in the quiescent phase ($G_{0}$), so the fraction of Ki-67 positive cells estimates the fraction of tumor cells actively cycling.

The cycling fraction $f$ divides once during the interval, converting $fN$ cells into $2fN$ cells.

The lesion was evaluated using Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography–Computed Tomography (FDG PET–CT), formally Positron Emission Tomography (PET) combined with Computed Tomography (CT), before and after three cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Hydroxydaunorubicin (Doxorubicin), Oncovin (Vincristine), and Prednisone (R-CHOP).

It utilizes standard terminology (DLBCL, R-CHOP), a validated imaging modality (FDG PET-CT), a standard quantitative metric ($\\mathrm{SUV}_{max}$), and a widely accepted response assessment framework (the Deauville scale). The numerical values for SUV are clinically realistic for an aggressive lymphoma before and after initial therapy.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed.

The Deauville scale is a standard, externally defined system that can be applied unambiguously to the provided data. A unique solution exists for both parts.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using objective, quantitative clinical data. There are no subjective or opinion-based claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires two distinct calculations based on the provided FDG PET-CT data.\n\n**Part 1: Fractional Reduction in Lesion $\\mathrm{SUV}_{max}$**\n\nThe fractional reduction, $\\Delta$, is defined by the formula:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{pre}} - S_{\\mathrm{post}}}{S_{\\mathrm{pre}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the pre-therapy (baseline) lesion $\\mathrm{SUV}_{max}$ as $S_{\\mathrm{pre}} = 18$ and the post-therapy (interim) lesion $\\mathrm{SUV}_{max}$ as $S_{\\mathrm{post}} = 5$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula yields:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{18 - 5}{18} = \\frac{13}{18}\n$$\nTo express this as a decimal, the division is performed:\n$$\n\\Delta = 0.722222...\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore,\n$$\n\\Delta \\approx 0.7222\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Deauville Score Determination**\n\nThe Deauville score is a five-point scale used to assess metabolic response in lymphoma based on FDG PET-CT. The score is determined by comparing the FDG uptake (typically $\\mathrm{SUV}_{max}$) of the residual lesion to the uptake in two reference regions: the mediastinal blood pool and the liver. The formal definitions are:\n\n- **Score 1**: No uptake or no residual uptake.\n- **Score 2**: Uptake present but less than or equal to the uptake in the mediastinal blood pool ($\\le$ mediastinum).\n- **Score 3**: Uptake greater than the mediastinum but less than or equal to the uptake in the liver ($>$ mediastinum and $\\le$ liver).\n- **Score 4**: Uptake moderately greater than the uptake in the liver.\n- **Score 5**: Uptake markedly greater than the uptake in the liver and/or presence of new FDG-avid lesions.\n\nFor the interim scan, we have the following values:\n- Lesion uptake: $S_{\\mathrm{post}} = 5$\n- Mediastinal blood pool reference: $\\mathrm{SUV}_{mean} = 2.2$\n- Liver reference: $\\mathrm{SUV}_{mean} = 2.9$\n\nWe perform a stepwise comparison:\n1. Is the lesion uptake ($5$) less than or equal to the mediastinal uptake ($2.2$)? No, since $5 > 2.2$. This rules out Scores $1$ and $2$.\n2. Is the lesion uptake ($5$) greater than the mediastinum ($2.2$) but less than or equal to the liver ($2.9$)? No, since $5 > 2.9$. This rules out Score $3$.\n3. The lesion uptake ($5$) is greater than the liver uptake ($2.9$). This indicates either a Score $4$ or a Score $5$. The distinction lies in whether the uptake is \"moderately\" or \"markedly\" greater, and whether new lesions are present. The problem text does not mention any new lesions. The ratio of lesion uptake to liver uptake is $\\frac{5}{2.9} \\approx 1.72$. This value represents an uptake that is clearly and observably greater than the liver, but not by a very large factor that would be described as \"markedly\" or \"intensely\" greater. Thus, the most appropriate classification is \"moderately greater than the liver.\"\n\nThis corresponds to a Deauville score of $4$.\n\nThe final answer requires a two-entry row matrix containing the fractional reduction and the Deauville score.\n- First entry: $\\Delta \\approx 0.7222$\n- Second entry: Deauville Score $= 4$",
