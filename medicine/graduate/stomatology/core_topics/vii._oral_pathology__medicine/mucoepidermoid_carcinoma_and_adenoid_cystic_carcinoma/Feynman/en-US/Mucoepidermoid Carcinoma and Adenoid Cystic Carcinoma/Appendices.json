            "problem": "A 48-year-old patient presents with a slowly enlarging mass on the posterior hard palate. An incisional biopsy reveals a salivary gland neoplasm with a mixture of solid nests and cystic spaces. The cystic lumina contain material that is strongly positive with an epithelial mucin stain (mucicarmine) and also positive with Alcian blue at pH 2.5. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates a basal cell population that is diffusely positive for tumor protein p63 (p63), whereas Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) is negative throughout the tumor. Cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117, c-kit) shows diffuse immunoreactivity. Focal cribriform-like architecture is present, and perineural invasion is noted at the margins. No overt zymogen granule-rich cells are seen on hematoxylin-eosin or periodic acid-Schiff with diastase digestion.\n\nYou are asked to apply principle-based decision rules to resolve this discordant profile in favor of a specific diagnosis. Base your reasoning strictly on core definitions and well-tested facts of histochemistry, immunophenotype, and molecular genetics in salivary gland tumors: epithelial mucin production by goblet/intermediate cells, the nature of pseudocyst luminal contents in adenoid cystic carcinoma, the lineage implications of p63 positivity, the acinar/ductal lineage marking by DOG1, and the diagnostic value of recurrent gene rearrangements detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) according to the Central Dogma of molecular biology.\n\nWhich of the following decision rules most appropriately resolves the discordance in favor of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and identifies the most aligned ancillary test to consolidate that diagnosis?\n\n- A. Prioritize the chemical identity of the luminal contents: mucicarmine-positive epithelial mucin in true cystic spaces indicates mucin-producing neoplastic cells, distinguishing mucoepidermoid carcinoma from adenoid cystic carcinoma whose pseudocysts contain basement membrane material; treat CD117 positivity and focal cribriform architecture as non-specific in this context; confirm with detection of Mastermind-Like Transcriptional Coactivator 2 (MAML2) rearrangement by FISH.\n- B. Elevate CD117 positivity and perineural invasion as decisive for adenoid cystic carcinoma; regard mucicarmine positivity as non-specific secretion; confirm with V-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB)-Nuclear Factor I B (NFIB) fusion testing by FISH.\n- C.

            "solution": "The problem statement is a complex, but clinically and pathologically realistic, case of a salivary gland neoplasm with features that overlap between mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). A step-by-step validation is required before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n\nThe provided data for this case are as follows:\n*   **Patient Demographics**: A 48-year-old patient.\n*   **Clinical Presentation**: A slowly enlarging mass on the posterior hard palate.\n*   **Histomorphology (H&E)**: A salivary gland neoplasm with a mixture of solid nests and cystic spaces. Focal cribriform-like architecture is present. Perineural invasion is noted at the margins. No overt zymogen granule-rich cells are seen on hematoxylin-eosin.\n*   **Histochemistry**:\n    *   The contents of cystic lumina are strongly positive with mucicarmine.\n    *   The contents of cystic lumina are positive with Alcian blue at pH 2.5.\n    *   Periodic acid-Schiff with diastase digestion (PAS-D) does not show zymogen granule-rich cells.\n*   **Immunohistochemistry (IHC)**:\n    *   The basal cell population is diffusely positive for tumor protein p63 (p63).\n    *   Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG1) is negative throughout the tumor.\n    *   Cluster of differentiation 117 (CD117, c-kit) shows diffuse immunoreactivity.\n*   **Problem Objective**: To apply principle-based decision rules to resolve the discordant profile in favor of a specific diagnosis, considering MEC and ACC as the primary differential. The reasoning must be based on core definitions of histochemistry, immunophenotype, and molecular genetics. The question asks to identify the most appropriate decision rule to favor mucoepidermoid carcinoma and the corresponding ancillary test.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n\n*   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is firmly based on established principles of surgical pathology and the specific diagnostic criteria for salivary gland tumors. All entities (MEC, ACC), stains (mucicarmine, Alcian blue, PAS-D), IHC markers (p63, DOG1, CD117), molecular markers (*MAML2*, *MYB-NFIB*), and morphological features (cribriform architecture, perineural invasion) are standard and correctly described in their diagnostic relevance. The scenario represents a classic and challenging differential diagnosis.\n*   **Well-Posed**: The problem presents a set of conflicting findings and asks for a resolution based on a hierarchy of diagnostic evidence. This is a standard process in pathology. The goal is to identify the most logically sound pathway to a diagnosis, which is a well-defined task. A unique, best answer exists based on current diagnostic standards.\n*   **Objective**: The description of the pathology findings is technical, precise, and free of subjective or biased language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws. The \"discordant profile\" is an intentional and realistic feature of the problem, designed to test the user's ability to weigh different types of evidence. It is not an internal contradiction that invalidates the problem. For example, perineural invasion and cribriform architecture strongly suggest ACC, while strong mucicarmine positivity strongly suggests MEC. Resolving this conflict is the essence of the diagnostic challenge.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the provided data against established diagnostic principles.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\n\nThe central task is to resolve the differential diagnosis between mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) based on the presented set of \"discordant\" features.\n\n$1$. **Analysis of Luminal Contents (Histochemistry)**: The material within the cystic spaces is strongly positive with mucicarmine and also positive with Alcian blue at pH 2.5.\n    *   Mucicarmine is a classic stain for epithelial mucins. Strong positivity indicates the presence of mucin-producing cells (goblet-like cells). This is a hallmark, and by definition, a required component of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.\n    *   Alcian blue at pH 2.5 stains acidic mucosubstances, which can include both epithelial sialomucins (found in MEC) and stromal glycosaminoglycans/proteoglycans like hyaluronic acid (found in the \"pseudocysts\" of ACC). However, the *strong mucicarmine positivity* is the key discriminant, as it specifically identifies epithelial mucin.\n    *   The characteristic \"cribriform\" spaces of ACC are not true cysts but rather pseudolumens filled with excess basement membrane material (e.g., laminin, collagen type IV, proteoglycans). This material is classically mucicarmine-negative.\n    *   **Conclusion**: This finding strongly favors MEC.\n\n$2$. **Analysis of Morphological Features**: The tumor shows a mixture of solid and cystic growth, with focal cribriform-like architecture and perineural invasion (PNI).\n    *   **Cribriform Architecture**: While classic for ACC, a cribriform pattern can be seen in other salivary gland tumors, notably the \"cribriform variant of MEC,\" which is a known diagnostic pitfall mimicking ACC.\n    *   **Perineural Invasion (PNI)**: PNI is a well-known and frequent feature of ACC, often considered a hallmark. However, it is not exclusive to ACC and can be seen in other malignant salivary gland tumors, including high-grade MEC.\n    *   **Conclusion**: These features are suggestive of ACC but are not pathognomonic and can be seen in MEC, making them less specific than the histochemical findings of the luminal content.\n\n$3$. **Analysis of Immunohistochemical Profile**:\n    *   **Diffuse p63 positivity**: p63 is a transcription factor that marks basal cells in stratified epithelia and myoepithelial cells. In MEC, it stains the basal and intermediate cell populations. In ACC, it stains the abluminal myoepithelial-like cells. Diffuse positivity is therefore expected in both tumors and is not a useful discriminator in this context.\n    *   **Diffuse CD117 (c-kit) positivity**: CD117 is strongly and diffusely expressed in most ACCs. While it can also be expressed in MEC, the expression is often more focal or less intense. Thus, diffuse positivity favors ACC but does not rule out MEC.\n    *   **DOG1 negativity**: DOG1 is a sensitive marker for acinar cells (in acinic cell carcinoma) and intercalated duct cells. In ACC, it typically stains the luminal cells. Its negativity argues against acinic cell carcinoma (already excluded by lack of zymogen granules) and slightly against ACC, although some ACCs can be DOG1-negative. MEC is characteristically DOG1-negative.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The IHC profile is mixed. Diffuse CD117 favors ACC, but DOG1 negativity and the non-specific nature of p63 do not provide a definitive answer.\n\n$4$. **Synthesis and Diagnostic Hierarchy**: In pathology, definitional criteria outweigh features that are merely characteristic or frequent. The production of true intracellular/intraluminal epithelial mucin (demonstrated by strong mucicarmine positivity) is a *defining* feature of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. In contrast, features like cribriform architecture, PNI, and CD117 positivity, while highly characteristic of ACC, are known to occur in mimics, including MEC. Therefore, the most logical approach is to prioritize the unequivocal evidence of mucin production. This resolves the discordance in favor of MEC, specifically a variant that mimics ACC (e.g., cribriform MEC).\n\n$5$. **Confirmatory Ancillary Testing**: According to the Central Dogma, the genetic makeup of a cell dictates its potential. Specific recurrent gene fusions are now primary diagnostic criteria for many tumors.\n    *   **MEC**: The vast majority of MECs are defined by a t($11$;$19$)(q$21$;p$13$) translocation, leading to a *CRTC1-MAML2* gene fusion. Less commonly, a *CRTC3-MAML2* fusion occurs. Detection of a *MAML2* gene rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the gold-standard confirmatory test for MEC.\n    *   **ACC**: A majority of ACCs are characterized by a t($6$;$9$)(q$22-23$;p$23-24$) translocation creating a *MYB-NFIB* gene fusion, or related fusions involving the *MYB* or *MYBL1* oncogenes. FISH for *MYB* rearrangement is the confirmatory test for ACC.\n    *   Given that the evidence points towards MEC, the most appropriate ancillary test is FISH for *MAML2* rearrangement.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. Prioritize the chemical identity of the luminal contents: mucicarmine-positive epithelial mucin in true cystic spaces indicates mucin-producing neoplastic cells, distinguishing mucoepidermoid carcinoma from adenoid cystic carcinoma whose pseudocysts contain basement membrane material; treat CD117 positivity and focal cribriform architecture as non-specific in this context; confirm with detection of Mastermind-Like Transcriptional Coactivator 2 (MAML2) rearrangement by FISH.**\n    This option correctly establishes the diagnostic hierarchy. It rightly prioritizes the strong mucicarmine positivity as a definitive feature of MEC over the less specific (though highly suggestive) features of ACC. It correctly identifies the nature of the luminal content as the key distinguishing feature. Lastly, it correctly identifies *MAML2* rearrangement by FISH as the state-of-the-art confirmatory test for MEC. This line of reasoning is entirely correct.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Elevate CD117 positivity and perineural invasion as decisive for adenoid cystic carcinoma; regard mucicarmine positivity as non-specific secretion; confirm with V-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog (MYB)-Nuclear Factor I B (NFIB) fusion testing by FISH.**\n    This option makes a critical error by dismissing strong mucicarmine positivity as \"non-specific.\" Strong staining for epithelial mucin is the defining feature of the \"muco-\" component in MEC and its presence is a powerful argument against ACC. Elevating features that have known overlap (PNI, CD117) above a definitional one is flawed diagnostic logic.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Interpret diffuse p63 positivity as pathognomonic for adenoid cystic carcinoma due to a dual cell population; confirm by smooth muscle actin immunostaining demonstrating myoepithelial differentiation.**\n    This statement is factually incorrect. Diffuse p63 positivity is not pathognomonic for ACC; it is seen in the basal/intermediate cells of MEC and other basaloid neoplasms. It highlights a cell lineage component common to both tumors in the differential, making it non-discriminatory.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Use DOG1 negativity to exclude mucoepidermoid carcinoma in favor of acinic cell carcinoma; confirm with Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 3 (NR4A3) rearrangement testing.**\n    This line of reasoning is completely backward. MEC is characteristically DOG1-negative. DOG1 is a marker for acinar/intercalated duct differentiation, and its *positivity* would be expected in acinic cell carcinoma. Therefore, DOG1 negativity is consistent with MEC and argues *against* acinic cell carcinoma. The problem also states there are no zymogen granules, further excluding acinic cell carcinoma.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. Consider cribriform architecture alone sufficient to establish adenoid cystic carcinoma, independent of luminal content; confirm by collagen IV immunostaining within luminal spaces.**\n    This is an oversimplification and a common diagnostic trap. Architecture alone is insufficient. Multiple salivary gland tumors can show a cribriform pattern. Ignoring the nature of the luminal content—the key piece of contradictory evidence in this case—is a major diagnostic error. While a positive Collagen IV stain in the lumina would support ACC, the premise of ignoring the mucin is fundamentally flawed.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed question in the field of diagnostic histopathology, specifically concerning salivary gland tumors. The provided clinical and pathological features are realistic and stated with sufficient precision to apply established grading criteria. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains no internal contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid for analysis.\n\nThe problem requires the application of specific grading systems to a set of histopathological findings from a minor salivary gland tumor of the palate. The findings are:\n-   A predominantly solid architecture.\n-   Approximately 70% of the tumor is composed of solid nests with scant lumina.\n-   Frequent mitoses.\n-   Focal coagulative necrosis.\n-   Conspicuous perineural invasion.\n-   No overt cytologic anaplasia.\n\nWe must evaluate each option by applying these findings to the relevant classification/grading system. The problem asks which classifications are supported, implying we should test the findings against the criteria for both mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), as these are the tumor types mentioned in the options.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology (AFIP) criteria for mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), this case is high-grade.**\n\nThe AFIP grading system for MEC, also known as the Auclair-Goode-Ellis system, is a point-based scoring system. Points are assigned for the presence of certain aggressive features:\n-   Intracystic component less than $20\\%$ of the tumor: $2$ points.\n-   Presence of neural invasion (perineural invasion): $2$ points.\n-   Presence of necrosis: $3$ points.\n-   Mitotic count of $\\geq 4$ mitoses per $10$ high-power fields (HPF): $3$ points.\n-   Presence of significant cytologic anaplasia: $4$ points.\n\nThe total score determines the grade:\n-   Low-grade (Grade I): 0-4 points\n-   Intermediate-grade (Grade II): 5-6 points\n-   High-grade (Grade III): $\\geq 7$ points\n\nLet us apply the given findings to this system, assuming the tumor is an MEC:\n1.  **Intracystic component**: The tumor is described as having a \"predominantly solid architecture\" with \"70% of the tumor composed of solid nests with scant lumina\". This implies a very small cystic component, certainly less than $20\\%$. Therefore, we assign **$2$ points**.\n2.  **Neural invasion**: \"Conspicuous perineural invasion\" is explicitly stated. Therefore, we assign **$2$ points**.\n3.  **Necrosis**: \"Focal coagulative necrosis\" is present. Therefore, we assign **$3$ points**.\n4.  **Mitoses**: \"Frequent mitoses\" is a qualitative description that, in pathology, corresponds to a high mitotic rate, which would meet the quantitative criterion of $\\geq 4$ mitoses/$10$ HPF. Therefore, we assign **$3$ points**.\n5.  **Anaplasia**: \"No overt cytologic anaplasia is described\". Therefore, we assign **$0$ points**.\n\nThe total score is $2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 0 = 10$ points.\nA score of $10$ is greater than or equal to $7$. According to the AFIP system, this corresponds to a high-grade (Grade III) MEC.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option A is consistent with the findings.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**B. Under the AFIP criteria for mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), this case is intermediate-grade.**\n\nAs calculated above, the total score under the AFIP criteria is $10$ points. The range for intermediate-grade MEC is 5-6 points. The calculated score of $10$ falls well outside this range.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option B is inconsistent with the findings.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Under the Szanto grading system for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), this case is Grade III (high-grade).**\n\nThe Szanto grading system for ACC is based on tumor architecture, specifically the proportion of the tumor that has a solid growth pattern.\n-   **Grade I (low-grade)**: Consists entirely of tubular and/or cribriform patterns. There is no solid component ($0\\%$ solid).\n-   **Grade II (intermediate-grade)**: Predominantly cribriform but has a solid component that constitutes less than $30\\%$ of the tumor.\n-   **Grade III (high-grade)**: The tumor has a solid component that constitutes $30\\%$ or more of the total tumor volume.\n\nLet us apply the given findings to this system, assuming the tumor is an ACC:\n-   The problem states that \"approximately 70% of the tumor [is] composed of solid nests\".\n-   Since 70% is greater than or equal to $30\\%$, the tumor meets the criteria for Grade III (high-grade) ACC.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option C is consistent with the findings.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\n**D. Under the Szanto grading system for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), this case is Grade II (intermediate).**\n\nAs noted above, the criterion for Grade II ACC is a solid component of less than $30\\%$. The given tumor has approximately 70% solid component.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option D is inconsistent with the findings.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. Under the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, perineural invasion alone suffices to classify any salivary gland carcinoma as high-grade regardless of architecture.**\n\nThis statement makes a broad claim about the WHO classification guidelines. Perineural invasion (PNI) is a well-recognized adverse prognostic factor in nearly all salivary gland carcinomas and is a component of several tumor-specific grading systems (e.g., the AFIP system for MEC, as shown above). However, the WHO classification does not have a universal rule stating that PNI, in isolation, automatically makes *any* salivary gland cancer high-grade. Tumor grading is nuanced and typically relies on a constellation of features, which are often specific to the particular type of carcinoma.\n\nFor instance, polymorphous adenocarcinoma is a malignancy that characteristically exhibits PNI, yet it is defined as a low-grade carcinoma. Similarly, a low-grade MEC can exhibit PNI; if PNI were the only adverse feature present (e.g., score of $2$ points), the tumor would remain low-grade. The presence of PNI is a single, albeit important, data point. Its weight in determining the final grade depends on the specific tumor type and the grading system being used. Thus, the statement that PNI *alone* suffices to classify *any* salivary gland carcinoma as high-grade is a factual oversimplification and is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the statement in option E is a false generalization.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**",

It uses standard terminology and describes a classic, realistic presentation of a major salivary gland carcinoma. The staging system cited, the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, $8$th Edition, is the authoritative, evidence-based standard for cancer staging in the United States and widely used internationally.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and clinically realistic. It tests specific, detailed knowledge of a formal classification system, making it a non-trivial and valid question.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Staging\n\nThe solution requires a direct application of the AJCC 8th Edition system for Carcinomas of the Major Salivary Glands (parotid, submandibular, sublingual). The primary tumor ($T$) classification is based on tumor size and the presence and extent of extraparenchymal extension (EPE).\n\nThe relevant $T$ categories are defined as follows:\n- **$T_X$**: Primary tumor cannot be assessed\n- **$T_0$**: No evidence of primary tumor\n- **$T_1$**: Tumor $\\leq 2$ cm in greatest dimension without extraparenchymal extension\n- **$T_2$**: Tumor $> 2$ cm but $\\leq 4$ cm in greatest dimension without extraparenchymal extension\n- **$T_3$**: Tumor $> 4$ cm and/or tumor with any extraparenchymal extension. (Note: EPE is defined as clinical or macroscopic evidence of invasion of soft tissues. Microscopic evidence alone does not constitute EPE for T-stage classification. However, invasion into specific, major structures is classified under $T_4$.)\n- **$T_{4a}$ (Moderately advanced disease)**: Tumor invades skin, mandible, ear canal, and/or facial nerve.\n- **$T_{4b}$ (Very advanced disease)**: Tumor invades skull base and/or pterygoid plates or encases carotid artery.\n\n**Analysis of the Initial Presentation:**\n1.  The tumor size is given as 3.5 cm.\n2.  This size satisfies the condition $> 2$ cm but $\\leq 4$ cm.\n3.  The lesion is described as \"confined to the parotid gland without radiologic evidence of extraparenchymal extension.\"\n4.  According to the AJCC $8$th edition criteria, a tumor with these features fits the definition of a $T_2$ primary tumor.\n\n**Analysis of the Disease Progression:**\n1.  A new finding is \"direct tumor involvement of the main trunk of the facial nerve.\"\n2.  The problem explicitly states this is not microscopic perineural invasion but direct invasion of a named structure.\n3.  Consulting the AJCC $8$th edition criteria, the definition for $T_{4a}$ disease explicitly includes \"Tumor invades... facial nerve.\"\n4.  This overrides the staging based on size alone. Regardless of the tumor being 3.5 cm, the invasion of the facial nerve automatically upstages the tumor.\n5.  The problem also explicitly rules out $T_{4b}$ disease by stating \"no involvement of the skull base, pterygoid plates, or carotid artery encasement.\"\n6.  Therefore, the progression of the disease to involve the facial nerve upgrades the primary tumor category from $T_2$ to $T_{4a}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The initial lesion is $T_2$ because it is $>2$ cm but $\\leq 4$ cm and confined to the gland; direct invasion of the facial nerve, a named structure, upgrades to $T_{4a}$ irrespective of tumor size because it denotes moderately advanced local disease.**\n- This option correctly identifies the initial stage as $T_2$ based on the size criteria (3.5 cm is between 2 cm and 4 cm) and the absence of EPE.\n- It correctly states that direct invasion of the facial nerve upgrades the tumor to $T_{4a}$.\n- It correctly notes that this upstaging is independent of tumor size.\n- It correctly uses the official AJCC terminology \"moderately advanced local disease\" for $T_{4a}$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The initial lesion is $T_3$ because it is $>3$ cm; facial nerve involvement reflects perineural invasion, which remains $T_3$ unless there is radiologic extraparenchymal extension.**\n- The initial staging is incorrect. The size cutoff for $T_3$ (by size alone) is $> 4$ cm, not $> 3$ cm. A 3.5 cm tumor is $T_2$.\n- The explanation for the upgrade is incorrect. It wrongly equates gross facial nerve invasion with microscopic perineural invasion. Even if it were considered simple EPE, the specific criterion for facial nerve invasion dictates a $T_{4a}$ classification, not $T_3$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The initial lesion is $T_2$ only for low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma; for high-grade histology it becomes $T_3$, and facial nerve involvement upgrades to $T_3$ only when accompanied by clinical facial palsy.**\n- This option is incorrect because, in the AJCC $8$th edition, the primary tumor ($T$) category is defined by anatomical extent (size and invasion) and is independent of histologic grade. Grade is a separate, critical prognostic factor used in the overall stage grouping, but it does not alter the $T$ category.\n- The upgrade to $T_3$ is also incorrect; facial nerve invasion leads to a $T_{4a}$ classification.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The initial lesion is $T_1$ because it is $<4$ cm, and nerve involvement does not alter the $T$ category unless there is skull base extension, which would then be $T_4$.**\n- The initial staging is incorrect. The cutoff for $T_1$ is $\\leq 2$ cm. A 3.5 cm tumor is $T_2$.\n- The explanation for the upgrade is incorrect. It falsely claims that nerve involvement does not alter the $T$ category, which contradicts the explicit criteria of the AJCC $8$th edition. Facial nerve invasion is a $T_{4a}$ criterion, while skull base extension is a $T_{4b}$ criterion.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The initial lesion is $T_2$ as described; however, facial nerve involvement upgrades directly to $T_{4b}$ because cranial nerve invasion constitutes very advanced disease by definition.**\n- The initial staging of $T_2$ is correct.\n- The upgrade classification is incorrect. Invasion of the facial nerve is the specific criterion for $T_{4a}$ (moderately advanced disease). $T_{4b}$ (very advanced disease) is reserved for invasion of deeper structures like the skull base or pterygoid plates, which are explicitly stated to be uninvolved in this case.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
