            "introduction": "At the heart of micro-invasive dentistry is the principle of altering the physical properties of a carious lesion to arrest its progression. This exercise uses a simplified physical model based on Fick's first law of diffusion to explore precisely how resin infiltration achieves this goal. By modeling the lesion as a porous medium, you will quantify how reducing the effective diffusivity—a measure of how easily acids can travel through the enamel—directly curtails the demineralizing acid flux, providing a foundational understanding of the intervention's mechanism of action .",

            "problem": "A non-cavitated enamel carious lesion is modeled as a one-dimensional slab of thickness $L$ in which lactic acid diffuses from a surface reservoir into the lesion body under quasi-steady conditions. The surface concentration is clamped at $C_{s}$ by an external acid reservoir, and the lesion-base concentration is clamped at $C_{b}$ by internal buffering. Under these boundary conditions the concentration gradient $\\partial C/\\partial x$ across the slab is time-invariant during each challenge. The diffusive flux of lactic acid is governed by Fick’s first law, $J=-D\\,\\partial C/\\partial x$, where $D$ is the effective diffusivity capturing microstructural effects of porosity and tortuosity within the lesion. After a micro-invasive resin infiltration, the effective diffusivity decreases by $80\\%$ relative to its pre-infiltration value due to reduced connected porosity and increased tortuosity, while $C_{s}$, $C_{b}$, and $L$ remain identical to the pre-infiltration challenge.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of flux by Fick’s first law, derive an expression for the fractional change in the magnitude of the acid flux, defined as $f=\\left(|J_{\\text{after}}|-|J_{\\text{before}}|\\right)/|J_{\\text{before}}|$, in terms of the change in $D$. Evaluate $f$ given the stated $80\\%$ reduction in $D$. Report $f$ as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the fractional change in the magnitude of lactic acid flux into an enamel carious lesion after a micro-invasive resin infiltration. The physical process is modeled as one-dimensional, quasi-steady-state diffusion through a slab of thickness $L$.\n\nThe governing equation for the diffusive flux, $J$, is given by Fick’s first law. For a one-dimensional system, this is:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the effective diffusivity, $C$ is the concentration of lactic acid, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the slab surface.\n\nThe problem states that the process occurs under quasi-steady conditions, which implies that the flux $J$ does not change with time or position within the lesion body. Therefore, the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$ can be written as a total derivative $\\frac{dC}{dx}$, and it must be constant throughout the slab for a given set of conditions (i.e., before or after infiltration). Let this constant gradient be $K$.\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dx} = K\n$$\nWe can integrate this differential equation with respect to $x$ to find the concentration profile $C(x)$:\n$$\nC(x) = Kx + A\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the constant of integration. We use the given boundary conditions to determine the constants $K$ and $A$. Let $x=0$ be the surface of the lesion and $x=L$ be the base of the lesion.\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1$. At the surface, $x=0$, the concentration is clamped at $C_s$: $C(0) = C_s$.\n$2$. At the base, $x=L$, the concentration is clamped at $C_b$: $C(L) = C_b$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$\nC(0) = K(0) + A = C_s \\implies A = C_s\n$$\nSo the concentration profile is $C(x) = Kx + C_s$. Applying the second boundary condition:\n$$\nC(L) = KL + C_s = C_b\n$$\nSolving for the constant gradient $K$:\n$$\nK = \\frac{C_b - C_s}{L}\n$$\nThe concentration gradient is indeed constant, as required by the steady-state assumption. Now, we substitute this expression for the gradient back into Fick's first law to obtain an expression for the flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = -D \\left( \\frac{dC}{dx} \\right) = -D \\left( \\frac{C_b - C_s}{L} \\right) = D \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship connects the flux $J$ to the diffusivity $D$ and the constant parameters $C_s$, $C_b$, and $L$. Physically, acid diffuses from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration, so we assume $C_s > C_b$, which makes $J$ a positive quantity. The magnitude of the flux is therefore $|J| = J$.\n\nLet $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $D_{\\text{before}}$ be the flux and diffusivity before infiltration, and let $J_{\\text{after}}$ and $D_{\\text{after}}$ be the values after infiltration. The parameters $C_s$, $C_b$, and $L$ are stated to be identical in both scenarios.\nThe flux before infiltration is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{before}} = D_{\\text{before}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThe flux after infiltration is:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{after}} = D_{\\text{after}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}\n$$\nThe fractional change in the magnitude of the acid flux, $f$, is defined as:\n$$\nf = \\frac{|J_{\\text{after}}| - |J_{\\text{before}}|}{|J_{\\text{before}}|}\n$$\nSince $C_s > C_b$, both $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $J_{\\text{after}}$ are positive, so we can remove the absolute value signs:\n$$\nf = \\frac{J_{\\text{after}} - J_{\\text{before}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} = \\frac{J_{\\text{after}}}{J_{\\text{before}}} - 1\n$$\nWe now substitute the expressions for $J_{\\text{before}}$ and $J_{\\text{after}}$:\n$$\nf = \\frac{D_{\\text{after}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}}{D_{\\text{before}} \\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}} - 1\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{C_s - C_b}{L}$, representing the driving force scaled by the lesion thickness, is constant and non-zero. It cancels from the numerator and the denominator, yielding a simple relationship between the fractional change in flux and the diffusivities:\n$$\nf = \\frac{D_{\\text{after}}}{D_{\\text{before}}} - 1\n$$\nThe problem states that the effective diffusivity decreases by $80\\%$ after infiltration. This translates to the following mathematical relationship:\n$$\nD_{\\text{after}} = D_{\\text{before}} - 0.80 \\times D_{\\text{before}} = (1 - 0.80) D_{\\text{before}} = 0.20 D_{\\text{before}}\n$$\nFrom this, we can find the ratio of the diffusivities:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\text{after}}}{D_{\\text{before}}} = 0.20\n$$\nSubstituting this ratio into the expression for $f$:\n$$\nf = 0.20 - 1 = -0.80\n$$\nThe fractional change in flux is $-0.80$. The problem asks for this value as a dimensionless decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nf = -0.8000\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates an $80\\%$ decrease in the magnitude of the acid flux, which is the intended therapeutic effect of the resin infiltration.",
