            "problem": "A patient presents with soft tissue changes around a mandibular implant restored with a screw-retained crown. Clinical examination reveals erythema and edema of the peri-implant mucosa and Bleeding On Probing (BOP) elicited with a calibrated probing force of $0.25\\,\\mathrm{N}$ at multiple sites. Probing depths range from $3$ to $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ circumferentially, with no suppuration. The patient reports no pain.

            "solution": "**Problem Validation**\n\nThe problem statement will be validated by examining its components for scientific soundness, consistency, and clarity.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Clinical Presentation**: A patient with a mandibular implant-supported screw-retained crown exhibits soft tissue changes.\n- **Clinical Findings**:\n    - Erythema and edema of the peri-implant mucosa.\n    - Bleeding On Probing (BOP) at multiple sites, elicited with a calibrated force of $0.25\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n    - Probing depths (PD) range from $3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ to $4\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Suppuration is absent.\n    - The patient reports no pain.\n- **Radiographic Findings**:\n    - Comparison between a current standardized periapical radiograph and a baseline radiograph taken $2$ weeks post-loading.\n    - Baseline marginal bone level: $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical to the implant platform.\n    - Current marginal bone level: $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ apical to the implant platform.\n    - The change in bone level is thus $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Known linear measurement error for the imaging technique is approximately $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - The problem explicitly states the bone level is considered radiographically stable.\n- **Assumed Foundational Facts**:\n    1. Biofilm is the primary etiology of peri-implant soft tissue inflammation.\n    2. BOP indicates inflammation.\n    3. Peri-implant health is the absence of clinical inflammation.\n    4. Progressive marginal bone loss beyond initial remodeling signifies a transition to a hard tissue lesion (peri-implantitis).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a classic and realistic clinical scenario in implant dentistry. The diagnostic criteria presented—clinical signs of inflammation (erythema, edema, BOP) and radiographic assessment of marginal bone levels—are standard in periodontology and implantology. The probing force ($0.25\\,\\mathrm{N}$) is the standard recommended force for periodontal and peri-implant probing to avoid tissue trauma while reliably detecting inflammation. The initial bone loss of $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is consistent with expected early bone remodeling after implant placement and loading. The foundational facts provided are cornerstones of the current understanding of peri-implant diseases as established by major consensus conferences (e.g., the 2017 World Workshop on the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions).\n- **Well-Posed and Objective**: The problem is specified with precise quantitative data (probing depths, bone levels, measurement error) and qualitative but objective clinical signs (erythema, BOP). The comparison of the radiographic change ($0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) to the measurement error ($0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is a logically sound method to conclude that there is no statistically significant bone loss, making the statement that the bone is \"radiographically stable\" a valid deduction within the problem's framework. The question asks for a diagnosis and a corresponding management plan, which can be uniquely determined from the provided information and foundational principles. The language is free of ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\n**1. Diagnosis of the Condition**\n\nThe diagnosis is determined by synthesizing the clinical and radiographic findings based on the provided foundational facts.\n\n- **Presence of Inflammation**: The clinical examination reveals erythema, edema, and, most critically, Bleeding On Probing (BOP). According to the provided fact that \"bleeding on gentle probing indicates inflamed sulcular epithelium,\" the implant site is unequivocally inflamed. This rules out a diagnosis of \"peri-implant health,\" which is characterized by the absence of such signs.\n\n- **Assessment of Bone Levels**: The key discriminator between peri-implant mucositis and peri-implantitis is the presence of progressive bone loss.\n    - The baseline bone level is $1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ below the implant platform.\n    - The current bone level is $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ below the implant platform.\n    - The apparent bone loss is $1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1.5\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - The stated measurement error of the radiographic technique is $0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n    - Since the measured change ($0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is less than the measurement error ($0.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), this change cannot be considered evidence of true progressive bone loss. The problem correctly concludes that the bone level is \"radiographically stable.\"\n\n- **Concluding the Diagnosis**: The condition is characterized by clinical signs of inflammation (BOP) in the absence of detectable progressive bone loss. By definition, this condition is **peri-implant mucositis**. It is an inflammatory lesion confined to the soft tissues surrounding the dental implant.\n\n**2. Pathogenesis-Consistent Management Plan**\n\nBased on the diagnosis of peri-implant mucositis and the foundational fact that \"dental biofilm is the primary etiologic factor,\" the management strategy must be directed at eliminating this cause.\n\n- **Etiology-Based Therapy**: The primary treatment for a biofilm-induced disease is the mechanical disruption and removal of the biofilm. This is achieved through professional debridement.\n- **Instrumentation**: The instruments used must effectively remove plaque and calculus without altering or damaging the implant surface, as a roughened surface would facilitate further plaque accumulation. Therefore, \"implant-safe\" instruments are required. Examples include ultrasonic scalers with non-metallic (e.g., PEEK, carbon fiber) tips, titanium curettes, or air-polishing devices using low-abrasive powders (e.g., glycine).\n- **Patient's Role**: Professional treatment alone is insufficient for long-term success. Reinforcement of the patient's oral hygiene practices is crucial to prevent biofilm re-accumulation.\n- **Adjunctive Therapies**: Local antimicrobials (e.g., chlorhexidine rinse or irrigation) can serve as useful adjuncts to mechanical debridement but are not effective as a monotherapy because they cannot penetrate an established biofilm.\n- **Systemic Therapy**: Systemic antibiotics are not indicated for treating localized gingivitis or mucositis. Their use is reserved for aggressive or advanced forms of periodontitis/peri-implantitis, or for systemic manifestations.\n- **Surgical Intervention**: Surgery is not a first-line treatment for peri-implant mucositis. Since mucositis is a reversible condition, resolving the inflammation by removing the etiology is the goal. Surgery is reserved for cases that have progressed to peri-implantitis, where access to the contaminated implant surface and management of the bone defect is necessary.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Peri-implant mucositis; initiate non-surgical biofilm disruption with implant-safe mechanical debridement (e.g., low-abrasive air-polishing or nonmetal tip ultrasonic instrumentation), adjunctive antiseptics as needed, reinforcement of patient plaque control, and risk factor modification; no systemic antibiotics indicated.**\n- **Diagnosis**: Correct. The condition is peri-implant mucositis.\n- **Management Plan**: This comprehensive plan is perfectly aligned with the current evidence-based standard of care. It correctly identifies the primary therapy (non-surgical biofilm disruption), specifies appropriate methods (implant-safe), includes essential secondary components (patient education, risk factor control), correctly positions adjunctive therapy (antiseptics), and rightly excludes inappropriate treatments (systemic antibiotics).\n- **Verdict**: **Correct**\n\n**B. Peri-implantitis; initiate systemic antibiotics and plan for surgical access with resective or regenerative therapy to address the hard tissue defect.**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. There is no evidence of progressive bone loss, which is a requirement for a peri-implantitis diagnosis.\n- **Management Plan**: This plan is for advanced peri-implantitis and is completely inappropriate for peri-implant mucositis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**\n\n**C. Peri-implant health; provide routine maintenance without active intervention because probing depths are shallow and there is no suppuration.**\n- **Diagnosis**: Incorrect. The presence of BOP, erythema, and edema are clear signs of inflammation, ruling out peri-implant health.\n- **Management Plan**: Failing to intervene actively in the presence of inflammation allows the disease to persist and potentially progress to peri-implantitis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**\n\n**D. Peri-implant mucositis; perform submucosal chlorhexidine irrigation alone and avoid mechanical instrumentation to prevent implant surface damage.**\n- **Diagnosis**: Correct.\n- **Management Plan**: Incorrect. This plan is fundamentally flawed. Antiseptic irrigation alone (monotherapy) is ineffective against an organized biofilm. Mechanical debridement is essential. The instruction to avoid mechanical instrumentation is contrary to the standard of care; modern techniques and instruments are specifically designed to be safe for implant surfaces.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**\n\n**E. Peri-implant mucositis; perform immediate surgical excision of inflamed peri-implant mucosa to eliminate the pocket epithelium as definitive therapy.**\n- **Diagnosis**: Correct.\n- **Management Plan**: Incorrect. This is an overly invasive and inappropriate treatment for a reversible inflammatory condition. The primary cause is biofilm, not the tissue's response. Removing the biofilm will allow the tissue and the epithelium to heal. Surgical excision is not a first-line therapy for mucositis.\n- **Verdict**: **Incorrect**",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of biostatistics and clinical epidemiology, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objective in its formulation. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of diagnostic test metrics for bleeding on probing (BOP) as an indicator for peri-implant mucositis. We are given the following counts from a verification study:\n- True Positives ($TP$): The number of implants with peri-implant mucositis that correctly tested positive with BOP. $TP = 34$.\n- False Positives ($FP$): The number of healthy implants that incorrectly tested positive with BOP. $FP = 12$.\n- True Negatives ($TN$): The number of healthy implants that correctly tested negative (no BOP). $TN = 38$.\n- False Negatives ($FN$): The number of implants with peri-implant mucositis that incorrectly tested negative (no BOP). $FN = 16$.\n\nThese data can be organized into a standard $2 \\times 2$ contingency table, where rows represent the test result (Positive/Negative) and columns represent the disease status (Present/Absent).\n\n|             | Disease Present | Disease Absent |\n|-------------|-----------------|----------------|\n| Test Positive | $TP = 34$         | $FP = 12$        |\n| Test Negative | $FN = 16$         | $TN = 38$        |\n\nThe problem asks for three tasks to be completed.\n\n1.

In probabilistic notation, this is the conditional probability $P(T^+ | D^+)$. The total number of diseased individuals is the sum of true positives and false negatives, $TP + FN$. The number of diseased individuals who test positive is $TP$. Therefore, the expression for sensitivity is:\n$$\n\\text{Sensitivity} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FN}\n$$\n\nSpecificity is defined as the probability that a test yields a negative result given that the disease is absent. This is the conditional probability $P(T^- | D^-)$. The total number of non-diseased individuals is the sum of true negatives and false positives, $TN + FP$. The number of non-diseased individuals who test negative is $TN$. Therefore, the expression for specificity is:\n$$\n\\text{Specificity} = \\frac{TN}{TN + FP}\n$$\n\n2.

In a binary outcome framework (presence versus absence of peri-implant mucositis), assume the following foundational modeling approach: the odds are defined as $\\frac{P}{1-P}$, where $P$ is the probability of peri-implant mucositis, and the natural logarithm of the odds (the log-odds) is modeled as a linear combination of risk indicators, with an intercept and coefficients estimated from data.\n\nConsider a patient with plaque index measured as percentage points on a $0$ to $100$ scale, current smoking status coded as an indicator, and prior periodontitis coded as an indicator.
