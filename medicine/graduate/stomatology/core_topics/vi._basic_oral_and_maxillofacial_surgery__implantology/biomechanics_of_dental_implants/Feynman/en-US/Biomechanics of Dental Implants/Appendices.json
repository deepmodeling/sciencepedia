            "problem": "A single posterior implant-supported crown has a functional cusp inclined at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the horizontal occlusal plane. During intercuspal contact, the patient applies a purely vertical biting force of magnitude $F_v$ at the cusp contact point. Assume a frictionless contact between opposing cusps so that the contact force at the interface is normal to the inclined plane, and assume the implant is axially aligned with the global vertical. The distance from the crestal bone level to the occlusal contact point, measured along the implant axis, is $h$. Using first principles of static equilibrium and vector resolution, derive the lateral (buccolingual) force component at the occlusal contact arising from the cusp inclination, and from that determine the bending moment magnitude at the crestal level due solely to this lateral component acting with lever arm $h$. Use the following data:\n- Vertical biting force: $F_v = 350\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- Cusp inclination: $\\theta = 25^{\\circ}$ (use degrees).\n- Occluso-crestal distance: $h = 10.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\nExpress the final bending moment in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot mm}$ and round your answer to $4$ significant figures.

            "solution": "The situation is modeled as a rigid body problem under static equilibrium with a vertical applied load transmitted through a frictionless inclined contact. By Newton’s laws and static equilibrium, the net force at the contact equals the normal reaction to the inclined plane, denoted $R$, which is oriented perpendicular to the plane.\n\nLet the global vertical axis be $z$ and the lateral (buccolingual) axis be $x$. The cusp plane is inclined at angle $\\theta$ relative to the horizontal occlusal plane. Under a frictionless assumption, the only contact force is the normal reaction $R$ along the plane normal. The applied biting force is purely vertical with magnitude $F_v$ directed along $-z$.\n\nResolve $R$ into vertical and lateral components. If the plane is inclined by $\\theta$ to the horizontal, the normal to this plane is tilted by $\\theta$ from the vertical. Therefore,\n- The vertical component of $R$ equals $R \\cos\\theta$ and must balance the applied vertical load $F_v$ for static equilibrium in the vertical direction:\n$$\nR \\cos\\theta = F_v \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad R = \\frac{F_v}{\\cos\\theta}.\n$$\n- The lateral (buccolingual) component of $R$ equals $R \\sin\\theta$, directed horizontally.

Your comment will not be graded numerically, but your computed stress will be graded.",
            "solution": "The fundamental relationship governing normal stress due to bending in a beam, as described by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, is the flexure formula:\n$$\n\\sigma(y) = -\\frac{M y}{I}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the normal stress at a distance $y$ from the neutral axis, $M$ is the bending moment about the neutral axis, and $I$ is the area moment of inertia of the cross-section about the same axis. The negative sign indicates that for a positive moment (causing the beam to bend concave up), the stress is compressive ($\\sigma  0$) for $y  0$ and tensile ($\\sigma  0$) for $y  0$. We are interested in the magnitude of the maximum stress.\n\nThe maximum normal bending stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$, occurs at the outermost fibers of the beam, where the distance from the neutral axis is maximized. For a solid circular cross-section of diameter $d$, the neutral axis passes through the center, and the maximum distance to the outer fiber is $c$:\n$$\nc = y_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{d}{2}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the maximum stress is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M c}{I}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by introducing the section modulus, $S$, which is defined as $S = I/c$. The formula for maximum bending stress then becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M}{S}\n$$\nTo solve the problem, we must first determine the bending moment $M$ and the section modulus $S$ for the implant neck.\n\nThe implant is modeled as a cantilever, and the occlusal force $F$ is applied at a horizontal lever arm $L$. This force creates a bending moment $M$ at the implant neck. The maximum bending moment in a cantilever beam subjected to a point load at its free end occurs at the fixed support. In this model, this corresponds to the implant-bone interface. The magnitude of this moment is the product of the force and the lever arm:\n$$\nM = F \\cdot L\n$$\nNext, we determine the section modulus $S$ for the solid circular cross-section. The area moment of inertia, $I$, for a circular cross-section of diameter $d$ about a diametral axis is:\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the section modulus $S = I/c$ with $c = d/2$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{I}{c} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi d^4}{64}}{\\frac{d}{2}} = \\frac{\\pi d^4}{64} \\cdot \\frac{2}{d} = \\frac{\\pi d^3}{32}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute the expressions for $M$ and $S$ back into the formula for $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ to derive the final symbolic relationship:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M}{S} = \\frac{F \\cdot L}{\\frac{\\pi d^3}{32}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{32 F L}{\\pi d^3}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the maximum normal bending stress at the outer fiber of the implant neck.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data. It is convenient to work with units of Newtons ($\\text{N}$) and millimeters ($\\text{mm}$), as the resulting stress will be in $\\text{N}/\\text{mm}^2$, which is equivalent to megapascals ($\\text{MPa}$).\nGiven values:\n- $F = 150\\,\\text{N}$\n- $L = 8.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n- $d = 4.0\\,\\text{mm}$\n\nFirst, calculate the bending moment $M$:\n$$\nM = F \\cdot L = (150\\,\\text{N}) \\cdot (8.0\\,\\text{mm}) = 1200\\,\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{mm}\n$$\nNext, calculate the section modulus $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\pi d^3}{32} = \\frac{\\pi (4.0\\,\\text{mm})^3}{32} = \\frac{\\pi (64\\,\\text{mm}^3)}{32} = 2\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^3\n$$\nFinally, calculate the maximum normal bending stress $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{M}{S} = \\frac{1200\\,\\text{N} \\cdot \\text{mm}}{2\\pi\\,\\text{mm}^3} = \\frac{600}{\\pi}\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\nComputing the numerical value and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{max}} \\approx 190.9859... \\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 191.0\\,\\text{MPa}\n$$\n\nRegarding the commentary on mitigating mechanical risk:\nThe derived formula, $\\sigma_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{32 F L}{\\pi d^3}$, explicitly shows the relationship between stress and the geometric parameters $L$ and $d$.\n- **Effect of implant diameter ($d$)**: The stress $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ is inversely proportional to the cube of the diameter ($d^3$). This means that a small increase in implant diameter leads to a substantial reduction in bending stress. For example, doubling the diameter would decrease the stress by a factor of $2^3 = 8$. Increasing the implant diameter is therefore a very effective strategy to reduce the risk of mechanical failure (e.g., fatigue fracture) of the implant components and to lower the stress transferred to the surrounding bone, which can help prevent bone resorption (osteolysis) due to mechanical overload.\n- **Effect of lever arm ($L$)**: The stress $\\sigma_{\\text{max}}$ is directly proportional to the lever arm $L$. Reducing the lever arm, for instance by shaping the crown to move the occlusal contact point closer to the implant's central axis, results in a proportional decrease in stress. This is a critical consideration in prosthetic design to minimize non-axial, or off-axis, loading and its detrimental bending effects.",
