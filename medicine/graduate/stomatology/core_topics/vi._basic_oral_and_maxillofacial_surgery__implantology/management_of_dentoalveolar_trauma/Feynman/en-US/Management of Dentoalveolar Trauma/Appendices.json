This practice problem focuses on a foundational clinical skill: the calculation of a maximum safe dose of local anesthetic based on patient mass. By working through this exercise , you will translate a pharmacological guideline, expressed in milligrams per kilogram, into a concrete clinical volume, ensuring both efficacy and patient safety.",

            "problem": "A $6$-year-old child with an alveolar fracture after dentoalveolar trauma requires Local Anesthesia (LA) for repositioning and splinting. The child’s mass is $20\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. You intend to use $2\\%$ lidocaine without vasoconstrictor for infiltration and nerve block. In pediatric pharmacology, safe local anesthetic dosing is governed by the mass-based limit in milligrams per kilogram, and solution concentration relates mass to volume through milligrams per milliliter. Assume a conservative maximum safe dose of lidocaine of $4\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$ in this scenario, and a solution concentration of $20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$ for $2\\%$ lidocaine.\n\nUsing only these foundational relationships, determine the maximum total lidocaine that can be safely administered to this child and the corresponding maximum total volume of the $2\\%$ solution. Report two values: the mass in milligrams and the volume in milliliters. Express the volume in milliliters. No rounding is required; provide exact values.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, presenting a standard pharmacological calculation with realistic clinical data. All necessary information is provided, and the problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the maximum total mass of lidocaine and the corresponding maximum volume of a $2\\%$ solution that can be safely administered to a child of a given mass. This is a problem of dimensional analysis, grounded in the fundamental principles of pharmacology.\n\nLet us define the variables based on the information provided:\n- The mass of the child, $m_{child} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- The maximum safe dose of lidocaine per unit body mass, $D_{max,specific} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mg/kg}$.\n- The concentration of the lidocaine solution is given as $2\\%$. We must first formalize this concentration, $C$, in units of mass per unit volume. A $2\\%$ solution, by mass per volume convention in pharmacology, signifies $2$ grams of solute per $100$ milliliters of solvent. We convert grams to milligrams:\n$$C = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{g}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{2 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{100\\,\\mathrm{mL}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}$$\nThis matches the value provided in the problem statement, which confirms the consistency of the givens.\n\nThe first objective is to determine the maximum total mass of lidocaine, denoted as $M_{max,total}$, that can be safely administered. This is calculated by multiplying the child's mass by the specific maximum safe dose.\n\n$$M_{max,total} = m_{child} \\times D_{max,specific}$$\n\nSubstituting the given values into this equation:\n$$M_{max,total} = 20\\,\\mathrm{kg} \\times 4\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mg}}{\\mathrm{kg}}$$\n\nThe unit of kilograms ($\\mathrm{kg}$) cancels, yielding the result in milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$):\n$$M_{max,total} = 80\\,\\mathrm{mg}$$\n\nThe second objective is to determine the maximum total volume of the $2\\%$ lidocaine solution, denoted as $V_{max,total}$, that corresponds to this maximum mass of lidocaine. The relationship between mass of a solute ($M$), its concentration in a solution ($C$), and the volume of the solution ($V$) is given by:\n$$C = \\frac{M}{V}$$\n\nTo find the volume, we can rearrange this formula:\n$$V = \\frac{M}{C}$$\n\nIn this specific case, we are calculating the maximum volume corresponding to the maximum safe mass:\n$$V_{max,total} = \\frac{M_{max,total}}{C}$$\n\nSubstituting the calculated maximum mass and the given concentration:\n$$V_{max,total} = \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{mg}}{20\\,\\mathrm{mg/mL}}$$\n\nThe unit of milligrams ($\\mathrm{mg}$) cancels, yielding the result in milliliters ($\\mathrm{mL}$):\n$$V_{max,total} = 4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$$\n\nThus, the maximum total mass of lidocaine that can be safely administered is $80\\,\\mathrm{mg}$, and this mass is contained within a volume of $4\\,\\mathrm{mL}$ of the $2\\%$ solution. The problem requires reporting both the mass in milligrams and the volume in milliliters as exact values.",

            "introduction": "The management of dentoalveolar trauma extends beyond the initial intervention, requiring careful planning and follow-up over weeks or months. Clinical scenarios are often complex, with patients sustaining multiple injuries at different times. This exercise  challenges you to synthesize treatment guidelines for different injury types into a single, coherent stabilization plan, calculating the appropriate splinting duration to ensure optimal healing for all affected teeth.",
            "id": "4729992",
            "problem": "A patient presents with sequential dentoalveolar injuries to the maxillary anterior segment managed with a flexible splint. Stabilization using a flexible splint is employed to allow periodontal ligament reattachment and stabilization of displaced teeth, with the clinical principle that minor mobility injuries (subluxation) require shorter stabilization than displacement injuries (extrusive luxation). For this scenario, use the following recommended stabilization durations: subluxation requires $2$ weeks, and extrusive luxation requires $4$ weeks. Assume $1$ week equals $7$ days, and count stabilization durations from the date of each injury. The flexible splint remains in place across the segment, and when multiple injuries coexist, the splint removal date is set to the latest individual removal date to ensure adequate stabilization for all affected teeth.\n\nClinical timeline:\n- On May $4$, $2025$, tooth $11$ sustains subluxation and a flexible splint is placed across teeth $12$ to $21$.\n- On May $12$, $2025$, tooth $21$ sustains extrusive luxation during sports, is repositioned, and the existing splint is continued.\n- On May $27$, $2025$, tooth $12$ sustains subluxation in a minor accident, and the same arch splint remains in place.\n\nUsing these dates and the stated durations, compute the individual splint removal dates for each injury and determine the combined plan for a single splint removal date that satisfies all injuries. Finally, compute the total continuous stabilization time, defined as the number of days from the initial splint placement (May $4$, $2025$) to the combined splint removal date. Express the final answer as a single integer number of days. Use the standard Gregorian calendar and whole-day counts; no partial-day rounding applies. Express your final answer in days.",
            "solution": "The problem is a well-posed application of date arithmetic based on established principles of dental trauma management. It is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically grounded. Therefore, it is deemed valid, and a solution is presented below.\n\nThe solution is approached in a stepwise manner. First, we establish the required stabilization durations in days. Second, we calculate the individual removal date for each injury. Third, we determine the single, combined removal date for the splint. Finally, we compute the total continuous time the splint was in place.\n\nThe given stabilization durations are:\n- For subluxation: $T_{\\text{sub}} = 2$ weeks.\n- For extrusive luxation: $T_{\\text{ext}} = 4$ weeks.\n\nUsing the conversion $1 \\text{ week} = 7 \\text{ days}$, we convert these durations into days:\n$$T_{\\text{sub}} = 2 \\times 7 = 14 \\text{ days}$$\n$$T_{\\text{ext}} = 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\text{ days}$$\n\nThe problem requires calculating durations which are differences between two dates. Let a date in the format Month-Day be represented by its ordinal day number in the year. A duration from a start date to an end date is the difference between their ordinal day numbers. For example, a $14$-day stabilization starting on May $4$ ends on May $18$, since May $18$ is $14$ days after May $4$. We will use this principle for all date calculations. The year is $2025$, which is not a leap year, so February has $28$ days. The number of days in the relevant months are: May ($31$), June ($30$).\n\nWe now compute the individual theoretical removal date for each injury, had it been the only one determining the splinting period.\n\n1.  **Injury 1: Subluxation of tooth $11$ on May $4$, $2025$.**\n    The injury date is $D_1 = \\text{May } 4, 2025$.\n    The required stabilization period is $T_1 = T_{\\text{sub}} = 14$ days.\n    The individual removal date, $R_1$, is $14$ days after May $4$.\n    $$R_1 = \\text{May } 4 + 14 \\text{ days} = \\text{May } 18, 2025$$\n\n2.  **Injury 2: Extrusive luxation of tooth $21$ on May $12$, $2025$.**\n    The injury date is $D_2 = \\text{May } 12, 2025$.\n    The required stabilization period is $T_2 = T_{\\text{ext}} = 28$ days.\n    The individual removal date, $R_2$, is $28$ days after May $12$. The month of May has $31$ days.\n    The number of days remaining in May after May $12$ is $31 - 12 = 19$ days.\n    These $19$ days are part of the stabilization. The remaining duration is $28 - 19 = 9$ days.\n    These $9$ days fall into the next month, June.\n    Therefore, the removal date $R_2$ is June $9$, $2025$.\n    $$R_2 = \\text{May } 12 + 28 \\text{ days} = \\text{June } 9, 2025$$\n\n3.  **Injury 3: Subluxation of tooth $12$ on May $27$, $2025$.**\n    The injury date is $D_3 = \\text{May } 27, 2025$.\n    The required stabilization period is $T_3 = T_{\\text{sub}} = 14$ days.\n    The individual removal date, $R_3$, is $14$ days after May $27$.\n    The number of days remaining in May after May $27$ is $31 - 27 = 4$ days.\n    The remaining duration is $14 - 4 = 10$ days.\n    These $10$ days fall into the next month, June.\n    Therefore, the removal date $R_3$ is June $10$, $2025$.\n    $$R_3 = \\text{May } 27 + 14 \\text{ days} = \\text{June } 10, 2025$$\n\nThe problem states that when multiple injuries coexist, the splint removal date is the latest of the individual dates to ensure all teeth are adequately stabilized. We must find the latest date among $R_1$, $R_2$, and $R_3$.\n$$R_1 = \\text{May } 18, 2025$$\n$$R_2 = \\text{June } 9, 2025$$\n$$R_3 = \\text{June } 10, 2025$$\nThe latest date is June $10, 2025$. Let this be the final removal date, $D_{\\text{final}}$.\n$$D_{\\text{final}} = \\max(R_1, R_2, R_3) = \\text{June } 10, 2025$$\n\nFinally, we must compute the total continuous stabilization time. This is defined as the number of days from the initial splint placement to the combined splint removal date.\nThe initial placement date is $D_{\\text{start}} = \\text{May } 4, 2025$.\nThe final removal date is $D_{\\text{final}} = \\text{June } 10, 2025$.\nThe total time is the duration between these two dates.\nWe can calculate this by summing the days in the interval:\n- Days in May: The period is from May $4$ to May $31$. The number of days is $31 - 4 = 27$.\n- Days in June: The period is from June $1$ to June $10$. The number of days is $10$.\nTotal stabilization time = (Days in May) + (Days in June) = $27 + 10 = 37$ days.\n\nAlternatively, we can use ordinal day numbers for verification. The year $2025$ is not a leap year.\nDays before May $1$: $31 (\\text{Jan}) + 28 (\\text{Feb}) + 31 (\\text{Mar}) + 30 (\\text{Apr}) = 120$ days.\nOrdinal day of $D_{\\text{start}}$ (May $4$): $120 + 4 = 124$.\nDays before June $1$: $120 + 31 (\\text{May}) = 151$ days.\nOrdinal day of $D_{\\text{final}}$ (June $10$): $151 + 10 = 161$.\nTotal continuous stabilization time is the difference between the ordinal day numbers:\n$$ \\text{Total Time} = 161 - 124 = 37 \\text{ days} $$\nThe two methods yield the same result. The total continuous stabilization time is $37$ days.",

            "introduction": "A key challenge in follow-up care is accurately diagnosing complications like pulp necrosis, as our initial assessments are fraught with uncertainty. This problem introduces a powerful tool from diagnostic theory: Bayesian updating. By applying this framework , you will learn how to formally combine your initial clinical suspicion (prior probability) with new evidence from a diagnostic test to arrive at a more accurate, updated risk assessment (posterior probability), guiding critical decisions about further treatment.",

            "problem": "A $16$-year-old patient sustains an extrusive luxation of a permanent maxillary central incisor. The tooth is immediately repositioned and stabilized with a flexible splint. Based on injury severity and root development, the clinician assigns a prior probability $P$ of pulp necrosis of $0.3$ at baseline, before any new test results. At the $4$-week review, the tooth yields a negative response to a standardized cold test. Assume the negative cold test has a likelihood ratio $LR$ for pulp necrosis of $3$ under these conditions, and that Bayesian updating applies.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definitions that pre-test odds are $P/(1-P)$, post-test odds equal likelihood ratio times pre-test odds, and posterior probability equals post-test odds divided by one plus post-test odds (without using any memorized shortcut formulas), derive the expression for the posterior probability $P'$ of pulp necrosis after observing the negative cold test and compute its value for $P=0.3$ and $LR=3$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the posterior probability of pulp necrosis, denoted as $P'$, based on a set of fundamental definitions, and subsequent calculation of its value. The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of medical diagnostics and Bayesian probability, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nLet $P$ be the prior probability of pulp necrosis and $LR$ be the likelihood ratio of the diagnostic test for necrosis. The problem provides the following data:\n- Prior probability, $P = 0.3$.\n- Likelihood ratio, $LR = 3$.\n\nThe derivation must proceed from the following given relationships:\n1.  Pre-test odds are defined in terms of the prior probability $P$ as:\n    $$\n    \\text{Odds}_{pre} = \\frac{P}{1-P}\n    $$\n2.
