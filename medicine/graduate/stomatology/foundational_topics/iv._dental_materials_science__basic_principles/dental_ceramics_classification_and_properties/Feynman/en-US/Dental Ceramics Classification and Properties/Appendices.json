The long-term success of these bilayer systems hinges on managing the residual stresses that develop during cooling after fabrication due to mismatched thermal properties. This practice will guide you through deriving and calculating the residual stress in a veneer, providing a quantitative grasp of thermal compatibility—a key factor in preventing veneer chipping and ensuring restoration longevity .",

Consider a core made of yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (Y-TZP) and a veneer made of feldspathic porcelain. Thermal compatibility in such bilayer systems depends on how differences in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) translate into residual stresses after cooling from the stress-free reference temperature at which the veneer’s glass network ceases to relax, approximated by the glass transition temperature. Using fundamentals of thermoelasticity and linear isotropic elasticity, derive from first principles an expression for the residual equi-biaxial stress in the veneer caused by CTE mismatch when the bilayer cools from the stress-free reference temperature to a lower service temperature. Assume perfect bonding, the veneer behaves as a thin film constrained by a much thicker core, in-plane equi-biaxial stress in the veneer, and plane stress conditions. Define compressive stress in the veneer as positive. Then, calculate the residual stress in the veneer for the following material properties and thermal history:\n\n- Veneer elastic modulus $E_{v} = 65\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{v} = 0.23$.\n- Core CTE $\\alpha_{c} = 10.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and veneer CTE $\\alpha_{v} = 8.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- The veneer’s stress-free reference temperature equals its glass transition temperature $T_{g} = 560\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n- Final service temperature $T_{s} = 37\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nRound your numerical answer to three significant figures and express the final stress in $\\mathrm{MPa}$.",
