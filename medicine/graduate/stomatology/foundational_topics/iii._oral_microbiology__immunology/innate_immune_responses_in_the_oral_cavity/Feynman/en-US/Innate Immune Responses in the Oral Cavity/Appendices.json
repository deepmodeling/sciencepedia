In healthy control saliva, $[\\text{NaCl}] \\approx 20\\,\\text{mM}$. Human beta-defensin 3 is a cationic peptide with effective net charge $z_{\\text{eff}} \\approx +6$ and is known to be recruited to negatively charged bacterial membranes by long-range electrostatics before engaging hydrophobic insertion and pore formation. Assume the bacterial surface potential at the membrane-water interface is approximately $\\phi_0 \\approx -50\\,\\text{mV}$ and that the initial approach distance relevant to recruitment is $x \\approx 1\\,\\text{nm}$. Treat the peptide as a point charge of magnitude $q = z_{\\text{eff}} e$ to estimate the electrostatic contribution to binding.\n\nStarting from fundamental electrostatics in a dielectric medium and the thermal distribution of mobile ions, justify how increased ionic strength $I$ modifies the range of electrostatic interactions and the resulting binding free energy.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically valid. It describes a well-documented biophysical phenomenon: the salt-dependent activity of cationic antimicrobial peptides. The scenario is grounded in the established principles of electrostatics in electrolyte solutions, specifically the Debye–Hückel theory. The provided parameters, constants, and the proposed mechanism are all consistent with the scientific literature on this topic. The problem is well-posed, objective, and allows for a quantitative solution based on fundamental physics.\n\nThe physical principle governing the interaction between the cationic defensin peptide and the anionic bacterial membrane in an electrolyte solution is electrostatic screening. Mobile ions in the saliva (primarily $\\text{Na}^+$ and $\\text{Cl}^-$) form an ionic atmosphere, or diffuse layer, around charged surfaces and macromolecules, which screens their electrostatic potential. The characteristic length scale of this screening is the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$.\n\nFor a general electrolyte solution, the Debye length is given by:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 k_B T}{\\sum_i n_i (z_i e)^2}} $$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_r$ is the relative permittivity of the medium, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $n_i$ is the number density of ion species $i$, and $z_i e$ is the charge of ion species $i$.\n\nFor a symmetric $1:1$ electrolyte like $\\text{NaCl}$ at molar concentration $C$ (in $\\text{mol/L}$), the number density of both positive and negative ions is $n = C \\times N_A \\times 1000$ (in $\\text{m}^{-3}$).

This leads to a much faster decay of the electrostatic potential away from the bacterial surface. Consequently, the attractive electrostatic energy that recruits the defensin peptide is substantially weakened. The potential magnitude $|\\phi(1\\,\\text{nm})|$ is reduced by a factor of $31.4/14.0 \\approx 2.24$, and the binding energy is reduced from a strong $7.3\\,k_B T$ to a moderate $3.3\\,k_B T$.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. At $[\\text{NaCl}] \\approx 150\\,\\text{mM}$, the characteristic screening length decreases to approximately $0.8\\,\\text{nm}$, which reduces $\\phi(x)$ at $x = 1\\,\\text{nm}$ by a factor of about $2$–$3$ compared to $20\\,\\text{mM}$, lowering the electrostatic binding free energy from roughly $7\\,k_B T$ to about $3\\,k_B T$. This weakens electrostatic recruitment to negatively charged membranes and attenuates pore formation; activity can be partially rescued by increasing peptide concentration or hydrophobicity.**\n- Our calculation for $\\lambda_{D,150}$ is $\\approx 0.79\\,\\text{nm}$, which matches \"approximately $0.8\\,\\text{nm}$\".\n- The reduction factor for the potential is $2.24$, which is in the range of $2$–$3$.\n- Our calculated binding energies are $\\approx 7.3\\,k_B T$ and $\\approx 3.3\\,k_B T$, matching \"roughly $7\\,k_B T$ to about $3\\,k_B T$\".\n- The physical interpretation is correct: weaker electrostatic energy leads to weaker recruitment and reduced overall activity. The proposed rescue mechanisms are biologically plausible means of overcoming a weakened binding affinity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. As ionic strength increases, counterions mediate attraction and extend its range, strengthening defensin binding; thus, high $[\\text{NaCl}]$ enhances efficacy by increasing the effective interaction distance.**\n- This contradicts the fundamental principle of Debye screening. Increased ionic strength leads to a *shorter* screening length ($\\lambda_D \\propto 1/\\sqrt{I}$), which *reduces* the range of electrostatic interactions and weakens them.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Debye screening only applies to multivalent electrolytes; monovalent sodium chloride does not change the screening length, so defensin–membrane electrostatics and efficacy remain essentially unaffected at $150\\,\\text{mM}$.**\n- This premise is false. Debye-Hückel theory was originally formulated for and is fundamentally applicable to all electrolytes, including monovalent ones like $\\text{NaCl}$. As calculated, the screening length is strongly dependent on the concentration of $\\text{NaCl}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Elevated $[\\text{NaCl}]$ primarily reduces the water dielectric constant enough to increase electrostatic attraction; at $150\\,\\text{mM}$ the dielectric decrease doubles the interaction strength, increasing pore formation probability despite any screening effects.**\n- The primary effect of increased salt concentration is screening, which weakens the interaction. The effect of salt on the dielectric constant (dielectric decrement) is a much smaller, secondary effect. Furthermore, a decrease in $\\varepsilon_r$ would decrease $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 k_B T / (2 n e^2)}$, thus *enhancing* the screening effect (i.e., further weakening the long-range interaction), not overcoming it. The claim that this effect dominates and increases attraction is physically incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Defensins act through specific receptor–ligand interactions that are insensitive to ionic strength; high $[\\text{NaCl}]$ therefore has negligible impact on antimicrobial efficacy in the oral cavity.**\n- This contradicts the problem statement, which specifies recruitment via long-range electrostatics. Electrostatic interactions are, by their nature, highly sensitive to ionic strength. The statement also contradicts the clinical observation of reduced activity at high salt, which necessitates a salt-dependent mechanism.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of immunology and cell biology, specifically the process of neutrophil chemotaxis in the oral gingival environment. The provided values for epithelial thickness and neutrophil speed are physiologically plausible. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, requiring the application of fundamental kinematic principles to a biological scenario. It is a suitable problem for an order-of-magnitude analysis.\n\nThe problem asks for the time, $t$, required for a polymorphonuclear neutrophil to traverse a specified distance, $d$, at a given average speed, $v$. We are instructed to use only core definitions from kinematics.\n\nThe fundamental relationship in kinematics for an object moving at a constant average speed is:\n$$v = \\frac{d}{t}$$\nwhere $v$ is the average speed, $d$ is the distance traversed, and $t$ is the elapsed time.\n\nThe givens from the problem statement are:\n- The traversal distance, which is the epithelial thickness: $d = 50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The average crawling speed of the neutrophil: $v = 10\\,\\mu\\text{m/min}$.\n\nWe must solve for the time, $t$. Rearranging the kinematic equation to solve for $t$ yields:\n$$t = \\frac{d}{v}$$\n\nBefore computing the numerical value, we must state and justify the assumptions made in this model.\n1.  **Constant Average Speed**: We assume the neutrophil maintains a constant average speed of $10\\,\\mu\\text{m/min}$ throughout its journey. The problem justifies this by stating the presence of a \"steady chemoattractant gradient.\" In a biological system, a cell's motion is a biased random walk rather than a smooth, constant-velocity transit. However, over the scale of the epithelial thickness, modeling the net displacement with an effective average speed is a common and acceptable simplification for an order-of-magnitude estimate. It averages out the start-stop motions and local directional changes.\n2.  **Linear Path**: We assume the path of motion is a straight line of length equal to the epithelial thickness, $50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. In reality, the neutrophil's path would be tortuous as it navigates the intercellular spaces. This tortuosity would increase the actual path length. However, the problem defines the speed as the \"average crawling speed\" over the \"traversal path\" to cross the \"vertical epithelial thickness.\" The most direct interpretation, in keeping with the instruction to avoid specialized transport formulae (which might include tortuosity factors), is to model this as effective linear displacement. The given speed is interpreted as the effective velocity component directed along the shortest path across the epithelium. This simplification is necessary for a direct kinematic calculation and is appropriate for the requested level of analysis.\n3.  **Negligible Latency**: We assume the traversal time calculation starts the moment the neutrophil enters the epithelium and ends the moment it exits. Any lag time for the cell to initiate movement in response to the chemokine signal (receptor binding, cytoskeletal rearrangement) is not included in this traversal time.\n\nWith these assumptions, we can proceed with the calculation. Substituting the given values into the equation for time:\n$$t = \\frac{50\\,\\mu\\text{m}}{10\\,\\frac{\\mu\\text{m}}{\\text{min}}}$$\n\nThe units of micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving the unit of minutes (min) in the result, which is dimensionally correct.\n$$t = \\frac{50}{10}\\,\\text{min} = 5\\,\\text{min}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final numerical time to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $5$. To express this to three significant figures, we write it as $5.00$.\n$$t = 5.00\\,\\text{min}$$\n\nFinally, a brief discussion on the biological significance of this timescale is required. A traversal time of approximately $5$ minutes is extremely rapid. Early dental plaque biofilm starts to form and mature on a timescale of hours. The ability of neutrophils, the first responders of the innate immune system, to be recruited to the site of plaque accumulation within minutes of receiving a sufficient chemokine signal is a critical feature of the host's defense mechanism. This rapid response allows the immune system to engage and control bacterial colonists before they can establish a mature, robust biofilm, which is more resistant to clearance. This timescale therefore highlights the high efficiency of the innate immune response in the oral cavity, which is essential for maintaining gingival health and preventing the onset of inflammatory diseases like gingivitis.",

Calculate the non-synergistic activation level, $A$, with $V_{D} = 0.6$:\n$$A = V_{D} \\times f_{D} = 0.6 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{6}{10} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = \\frac{24}{50} = \\frac{12}{25} = 0.48$$\n\n5.  Finally, calculate the synergistic secretion rate, $r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}}$, using $k = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{pg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}\\,\\text{per arbitrary unit}$, $s = 1.5$, and the calculated values for $P$ and $A$.\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = k s^2 P A = (0.04) \\times (1.5)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{100}{3}\\right) \\times (0.48)$$\nWe can express the decimal values as fractions for an exact calculation: $k = \\frac{4}{100} = \\frac{1}{25}$, $s = \\frac{3}{2}$, and $A = \\frac{12}{25}$.\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{25}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)^2 \\times \\left(\\frac{100}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{12}{25}\\right)$$\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = \\frac{1}{25} \\times \\frac{9}{4} \\times \\frac{100}{3} \\times \\frac{12}{25}$$\nNow, we simplify the expression by rearranging terms:\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = \\left(\\frac{100}{25 \\times 4}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{9}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{12}{25} = \\left(\\frac{100}{100}\\right) \\times (3) \\times \\frac{12}{25}$$\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = 1 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{12}{25} = \\frac{36}{25}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$r'_{\\mathrm{IL1\\beta}} = 1.44$$\nThe units are $(\\frac{\\mathrm{pg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}}{\\text{arb. unit}}) \\times (\\frac{\\text{arb. unit}}{\\mathrm{h}}) = \\mathrm{pg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $1.44$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $1.440$.\nThe final computed secretion rate is $1.440\\,\\mathrm{pg}\\,\\mathrm{mL}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.",
