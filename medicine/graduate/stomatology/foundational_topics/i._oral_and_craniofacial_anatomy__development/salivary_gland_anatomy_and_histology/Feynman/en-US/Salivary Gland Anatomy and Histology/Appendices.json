            "problem": "A morphometric study of human submandibular gland lobules is performed on paraffin-embedded sections. The digital micrograph calibration yields a pixel size of $0.65 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m/pixel}$. The mean lobular diameter measured on the sections is $1540$ pixels. Histoprocessing introduces an isotropic linear shrinkage of $13\\%$ relative to the fresh (in vivo) state.

The assumption of spherical lobules is a common, reasonable simplification for volumetric estimation. The values provided are biophysically plausible.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data and relationships to compute a unique numerical result. The question is unambiguous.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of subjective elements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe solution is derived by following a logical sequence of calculations, starting from the raw pixel measurement and progressively applying the given corrections and definitions.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Measured Diameter in Physical Units**\nThe measured diameter on the digital micrograph, denoted as $D_{\\text{sec}}$, is the product of the diameter in pixels ($D_{\\text{pix}}$) and the pixel size calibration factor ($C$).\n\n$$D_{\\text{sec}} = D_{\\text{pix}} \\times C$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D_{\\text{sec}} = 1540 \\, \\text{pixels} \\times 0.65 \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{\\mu m}}{\\text{pixel}} = 1001 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\nThis value represents the diameter of the shrunken lobule as observed on the processed histological section.\n\n**2. Correction for Tissue Shrinkage**\nThe problem states that histoprocessing introduces an isotropic linear shrinkage of $s = 0.13$. The relationship between the fresh (in vivo) linear dimension, $L_{\\text{fresh}}$, and the shrunken (section) linear dimension, $L_{\\text{sec}}$, is given by the principle:\n\n$$L_{\\text{sec}} = (1 - s) L_{\\text{fresh}}$$\n\nWe apply this principle to the diameter. The measured section diameter $D_{\\text{sec}}$ is the shrunken dimension. We need to find the true fresh diameter, $D_{\\text{fresh}}$.\n\n$$D_{\\text{sec}} = (1 - s) D_{\\text{fresh}}$$\n\nRearranging the formula to solve for $D_{\\text{fresh}}$:\n$$D_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{D_{\\text{sec}}}{1 - s}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $D_{\\text{sec}}$ and $s$:\n$$D_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{1001 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}}{1 - 0.13} = \\frac{1001}{0.87} \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the True Fresh Lobule Volume**\nThe problem specifies that the fresh lobule is to be modeled as a sphere. The volume $V$ of a sphere is a function of its radius $R$, given by $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. The radius is half the diameter, so $R = \\frac{D}{2}$. Substituting this into the volume formula yields:\n\n$$V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{D}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{D^3}{8} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi D^3$$\n\nWe use this formula to calculate the fresh volume, $V_{\\text{fresh}}$, using the fresh diameter, $D_{\\text{fresh}}$:\n\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi (D_{\\text{fresh}})^3$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $D_{\\text{fresh}}$ from the previous step:\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} = \\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1001}{0.87}\\right)^3 \\, (\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3$$\n\nThis expression gives the true fresh volume in cubic micrometers.\n\n**4. Unit Conversion and Final Numerical Calculation**\nThe final answer must be in nanoliters (nL). We must establish the conversion factor between cubic micrometers ($(\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3$) and nanoliters.\n\n-   $1 \\, \\text{L} = 1 \\, (\\text{dm})^3$\n-   $1 \\, \\text{dm} = 10 \\, \\text{cm} = 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n-   Therefore, $1 \\, \\text{L} = (10^5 \\, \\mathrm{\\mu m})^3 = 10^{15} \\, (\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3$\n-   A nanoliter is $1 \\, \\text{nL} = 10^{-9} \\, \\text{L}$.\n-   Substituting the conversion for liters: $1 \\, \\text{nL} = 10^{-9} \\times 10^{15} \\, (\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3 = 10^6 \\, (\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3$.\n\nThis means to convert a volume from $(\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3$ to nL, one must divide by $10^6$.\n\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} \\, [\\text{nL}] = \\frac{V_{\\text{fresh}} \\, [(\\mathrm{\\mu m})^3]}{10^6}$$\n\nNow, we perform the full calculation:\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} \\, [\\text{nL}] = \\frac{1}{10^6} \\left[ \\frac{1}{6}\\pi \\left(\\frac{1001}{0.87}\\right)^3 \\right] = \\frac{\\pi \\cdot 1001^3}{6 \\cdot 10^6 \\cdot 0.87^3}$$\n\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} \\approx \\frac{3.14159265 \\times (1.003003 \\times 10^9)}{6 \\times 10^6 \\times 0.658503}$$\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} \\approx \\frac{3.150985 \\times 10^9}{3.951018 \\times 10^6} \\approx 797.511 \\dots$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$V_{\\text{fresh}} \\approx 797.5 \\, \\text{nL}$$",

Assume the following biological and statistical foundations: salivary gland parenchyma is composed of acini (serous and mucous) supported by myoepithelial cells and connected by ductal systems; under routine staining, the enumerated categories correspond to mutually exclusive cell phenotypes identifiable by morphology and immunophenotype. Statistically, assume that each annotated cell is an independent and identically distributed draw from a categorical distribution over these five types, with category probabilities $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}, p_{4}, p_{5})$ for serous acinar, mucous acinar, ductal epithelial, myoepithelial, and resident immune cells, respectively.

            "solution": "The problem will be validated before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Cell Categories:** 1. serous acinar, 2. mucous acinar, 3. ductal epithelial, 4. myoepithelial, 5. resident immune cells.

The data is consistent and the required methodology is standard and well-defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n**1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of Proportions**\n\nThe observed counts $\\mathbf{n} = (n_{1}, \\dots, n_{5})$ are assumed to be a realization of a random variable following a multinomial distribution with parameters $N$ and $\\mathbf{p} = (p_{1}, \\dots, p_{5})$. The probability mass function is given by:\n$$ P(\\mathbf{N}=\\mathbf{n} | \\mathbf{p}, N) = \\frac{N!}{n_{1}! n_{2}! n_{3}! n_{4}! n_{5}!} p_{1}^{n_{1}} p_{2}^{n_{2}} p_{3}^{n_{3}} p_{4}^{n_{4}} p_{5}^{n_{5}} $$\nwhere $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} n_{i} = N$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i} = 1$.\n\nThe likelihood function $L(\\mathbf{p} | \\mathbf{n})$ is proportional to the probability mass function. It is more convenient to work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\mathbf{p}) = \\ln L(\\mathbf{p} | \\mathbf{n})$:\n$$ \\ell(\\mathbf{p}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{5} n_{i}!}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^{5} n_{i} \\ln(p_{i}) $$\nTo find the MLEs $\\hat{\\mathbf{p}}$, we maximize $\\ell(\\mathbf{p})$ subject to the constraint $g(\\mathbf{p}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i} - 1 = 0$. We use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian function is:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{p}, \\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} n_{i} \\ln(p_{i}) - \\lambda \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i} - 1\\right) $$\nWe take the partial derivative with respect to each $p_{i}$ and set it to zero:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{n_{i}}{p_{i}} - \\lambda = 0 \\implies p_{i} = \\frac{n_{i}}{\\lambda} $$\nSumming over all $i$ and using the constraint:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} \\frac{n_{i}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{5} n_{i} = \\frac{N}{\\lambda} = 1 $$\nThis implies that the Lagrange multiplier is $\\lambda = N$. Substituting this back gives the MLE for each proportion:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{i} = \\frac{n_{i}}{N} $$\nUsing the given data:\n-   $\\hat{p}_{1} = \\frac{1024}{1600} = 0.64$. Rounded to four significant figures: $0.6400$.\n-   $\\hat{p}_{2} = \\frac{256}{1600} = 0.16$. Rounded to four significant figures: $0.1600$.\n-   $\\hat{p}_{3} = \\frac{192}{1600} = 0.12$. Rounded to four significant figures: $0.1200$.\n-   $\\hat{p}_{4} = \\frac{96}{1600} = 0.06$. Rounded to four significant figures: $0.06000$.\n-   $\\hat{p}_{5} = \\frac{32}{1600} = 0.02$. Rounded to four significant figures: $0.02000$.\n\n**2. Asymptotic Confidence Intervals for Proportions**\n\nThe problem asks to treat each category marginally. For a given category $i$, we consider a cell to be a \"success\" if it belongs to category $i$ and a \"failure\" otherwise. This reduces the problem to a binomial setting. The number of cells in category $i$, $n_i$, follows a binomial distribution $n_i \\sim \\text{Binomial}(N, p_i)$.\n\nThe sample proportion $\\hat{p}_i = n_i/N$ is an unbiased estimator of $p_i$. For large $N$, the Central Limit Theorem ensures that the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}_i$ is approximately normal:\n$$ \\hat{p}_i \\approx \\mathcal{N}\\left(p_i, \\frac{p_i(1-p_i)}{N}\\right) $$\nThe standard error of $\\hat{p}_i$ is $SE(\\hat{p}_i) = \\sqrt{\\frac{p_i(1-p_i)}{N}}$. Since $p_i$ is unknown, we estimate the standard error by substituting $\\hat{p}_i$ for $p_i$:\n$$ \\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_i) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{p}_i(1-\\hat{p}_i)}{N}} $$\nA two-sided $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $p_i$ is given by the formula for the Wald interval:\n$$ \\hat{p}_i \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2} \\times \\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_i) $$\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $\\alpha = 0.05$, and the critical value is $z_{1-0.05/2} = z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$. We use the standard rounded value $z_{0.975} = 1.96$. The total sample size is $N=1600$.\n\nNow we compute the confidence intervals for each category:\n\n-   **Category 1 (serous acinar):** $\\hat{p}_{1} = 0.6400$\n    -   $\\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_{1}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.64(1-0.64)}{1600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.2304}{1600}} = 0.012$\n    -   Margin of Error: $ME_{1} = 1.96 \\times 0.012 = 0.02352$\n    -   CI: $0.6400 \\pm 0.02352 = [0.61648, 0.66352]$\n    -   Rounded to 4 sig figs: $[0.6165, 0.6635]$\n\n-   **Category 2 (mucous acinar):** $\\hat{p}_{2} = 0.1600$\n    -   $\\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_{2}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.16(1-0.16)}{1600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1344}{1600}} \\approx 0.00916515$\n    -   Margin of Error: $ME_{2} = 1.96 \\times 0.00916515 \\approx 0.01796369$\n    -   CI: $0.1600 \\pm 0.01796369 = [0.14203631, 0.17796369]$\n    -   Rounded to 4 sig figs: $[0.1420, 0.1780]$\n\n-   **Category 3 (ductal epithelial):** $\\hat{p}_{3} = 0.1200$\n    -   $\\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_{3}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.12(1-0.12)}{1600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1056}{1600}} \\approx 0.00812404$\n    -   Margin of Error: $ME_{3} = 1.96 \\times 0.00812404 \\approx 0.01592311$\n    -   CI: $0.1200 \\pm 0.01592311 = [0.10407689, 0.13592311]$\n    -   Rounded to 4 sig figs: $[0.1041, 0.1359]$\n\n-   **Category 4 (myoepithelial):** $\\hat{p}_{4} = 0.06000$\n    -   $\\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_{4}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.06(1-0.06)}{1600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0564}{1600}} \\approx 0.00593717$\n    -   Margin of Error: $ME_{4} = 1.96 \\times 0.00593717 \\approx 0.01163685$\n    -   CI: $0.06000 \\pm 0.01163685 = [0.04836315, 0.07163685]$\n    -   Rounded to 4 sig figs: $[0.04836, 0.07164]$\n\n-   **Category 5 (resident immune):** $\\hat{p}_{5} = 0.02000$\n    -   $\\widehat{SE}(\\hat{p}_{5}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.02(1-0.02)}{1600}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.0196}{1600}} = 0.0035$\n    -   Margin of Error: $ME_{5} = 1.96 \\times 0.0035 = 0.00686$\n    -   CI: $0.02000 \\pm 0.00686 = [0.01314, 0.02686]$\n    -   Rounded to 4 sig figs: $[0.01314, 0.02686]$\n\nThe final results are compiled into a single row matrix as requested.

It is not trivial or pseudo-profound.\n    -   (7) The derived relationship is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the Hagen-Poiseuille equation from the specified form of the Navier-Stokes equations and then applying the result to the two specified conditions (normal and obstructed).\n\nThe starting point is the momentum equation of the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$. For steady flow in the axial ($z$) direction, we have velocity components $v_r = 0$, $v_\\theta = 0$, and the axial velocity $v_z$ is a function of the radial position, $v_z = v_z(r)$. The latter is a consequence of the flow being fully developed ($\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$) and axisymmetric ($\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$).\n\nUnder these conditions, the $z$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation simplifies significantly. The equation is:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial t} + v_r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_\\theta}{r} \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial \\theta} + v_z \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} \\right) = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\left[ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} \\right] + \\rho g_z\n$$\nApplying the assumptions:\n-   Steady flow: $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial t} = 0$.\n-   No radial or azimuthal velocity: $v_r = 0$, $v_\\theta = 0$.\n-   Axisymmetric flow: $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial \\theta^2} = 0$.\n-   Fully developed flow: $\\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial z} = 0$, which also implies $\\frac{\\partial^2 v_z}{\\partial z^2} = 0$.\n-   Neglecting gravitational effects ($g_z = 0$) or assuming a horizontal duct.\n\nThe equation reduces to:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z} + \\mu \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial v_z}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nSince $v_z$ depends only on $r$, the left side of the equation is a function of $r$ only. The pressure $P$ can depend on $z$ and $r$. However, from the $r$-component of the Navier-Stokes equation, it can be shown that $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial r} = 0$, so $P$ is a function of $z$ only. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial z}$ is not a function of $r$. This allows us to write the partial derivatives as ordinary derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dz} = \\frac{\\mu}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} \\right)\n$$\nSince the left side is a function of $z$ only and the right side is a function of $r$ only, both sides must be equal to a constant. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ is constant along the duct. We can rearrange and integrate with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dv_z}{dr} \\right) = \\frac{r}{\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz}\n$$\nIntegrating once gives:\n$$\nr \\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{r^2}{2\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1\n$$\nDividing by $r$ and integrating a second time:\n$$\n\\frac{dv_z}{dr} = \\frac{r}{2\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + \\frac{C_1}{r}\n$$\n$$\nv_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_1 \\ln(r) + C_2\n$$\nWe apply two boundary conditions. First, the velocity at the centerline ($r=0$) must be finite. The term $C_1 \\ln(r)$ diverges as $r \\to 0$, so we must have $C_1=0$. Second, the no-slip condition at the duct wall (at radius $R$) states that the fluid velocity is zero: $v_z(R)=0$. Using the problem's notation, the radius is $r_{duct}$. To avoid confusion with the coordinate $r$, we will use $R$ for the duct radius during the derivation.\n$$\nv_z(R) = 0 = \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the velocity profile equation:\n$$\nv_z(r) = \\frac{r^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} - \\frac{R^2}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\frac{dP}{dz} (r^2 - R^2)\n$$\nThe pressure gradient $\\frac{dP}{dz}$ must be negative to drive flow in the positive $z$ direction. Let the pressure drop over the length $L$ be $\\Delta P = P_0 - P_L > 0$. Then $\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$.\n$$\nv_z(r) = \\frac{1}{4\\mu} \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}\\right) (r^2 - R^2) = \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2)\n$$\nThis is the parabolic velocity profile for laminar flow in a pipe.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found by integrating the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the duct:\n$$\nQ = \\int_{A} v_z \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{R} v_z(r) (2\\pi r) \\, dr\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\int_{0}^{R} \\frac{\\Delta P}{4\\mu L} (R^2 - r^2) (2\\pi r) \\, dr = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta P}{4\\mu L} \\int_{0}^{R} (R^2 r - r^3) \\, dr\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left[ R^2 \\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{R} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{2} - \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta P}{2\\mu L} \\left( \\frac{R^4}{4} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta P}{8\\mu L}\n$$\nThis is the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The first part of the problem asks for the relationship between the axial pressure gradient ($-\\frac{\\Delta P}{L}$) and the volumetric flow rate $Q$. From the above, this is $\\frac{\\Delta P}{L} = \\frac{8\\mu Q}{\\pi R^4}$. The second part asks for the pressure drop $\\Delta P$. We solve for $\\Delta P$ and revert to the problem's notation where the duct radius is denoted by $r$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nThis is the pressure drop under normal conditions, so we label it $\\Delta P_{\\text{normal}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{normal}} = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4}\n$$\nNow, we consider the case with the sialolith. The duct radius is uniformly reduced to $r_{\\text{stone}} = r(1 - \\epsilon)$. The viscosity $\\mu$, length $L$, and volumetric flow rate $Q$ are assumed to remain the same. The pressure drop required to maintain this flow rate, $\\Delta P_{\\text{stone}}$, is found by substituting the new radius into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\Delta P_{\\text{stone}} = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi (r_{\\text{stone}})^4} = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi [r(1 - \\epsilon)]^4} = \\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4 (1 - \\epsilon)^4}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the multiplicative factor, which is the ratio $\\Delta P_{\\text{stone}} / \\Delta P_{\\text{normal}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{stone}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{\\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4 (1 - \\epsilon)^4}}{\\frac{8\\mu L Q}{\\pi r^4}}\n$$\nThe terms $8$, $\\mu$, $L$, $Q$, $\\pi$, and $r^4$ cancel, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta P_{\\text{stone}}}{\\Delta P_{\\text{normal}}} = \\frac{1}{(1 - \\epsilon)^4}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the required ratio.",
