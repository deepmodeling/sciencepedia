            "problem": "A permanent mandibular premolar is examined under magnification and standardized illumination. The clinical crown shows minimal occlusal wear. The following occlusal observations are recorded by an examiner trained in morphometric analysis:\n\n- On the lingual half of the occlusal table, there are two domed elevations with distinct apices separated by a developmental depression that is continuous with a shallow groove crossing onto the lingual surface for approximately $0.7$ mm.

Three-cusp type with $H$-pattern central groove",
            "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe explicit observations recorded from a permanent mandibular premolar are as follows:\n1.  **Lingual Occlusal Morphology:** On the lingual half of the occlusal table, there are two domed elevations with distinct apices.\n2.  **Lingual Groove:** These two elevations are separated by a developmental depression that is continuous with a shallow groove crossing onto the lingual surface for approximately $0.7$ mm.\n3.  **Lingual Cusp Proportions:** The mesiolingual elevation is broader than the distolingual elevation.\n4.  **Central Occlusal Morphology:** The buccal cusp triangular ridge terminates at a centrally placed fossa without forming a continuous transverse ridge to any single lingual elevation.\n5.  **Occlusal Outline:** The occlusal outline is closer to a square than to an oval.\n6.  **Pit Configuration:** Three discrete pits are recognizable: one near the center of the occlusal table, and one each in the mesial and distal fossae.\n\nThe question asks for the correct classification (cusp number) and central groove pattern based on these findings.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is rooted in the field of dental anatomy, a sub-discipline of stomatology. The terminology used, such as \"cusp,\" \"triangular ridge,\" \"fossa,\" \"pit,\" and \"developmental groove,\" are standard and well-defined within this field. The described features correspond to known morphological variations of human permanent mandibular second premolars.\n\n-   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is scientifically grounded. The descriptions of cusp formations, groove patterns, and occlusal outlines are consistent with established principles of dental morphology as documented in authoritative textbooks (e.g., *Wheeler's Dental Anatomy, Physiology, and Occlusion*). The distinction between two-cusp and three-cusp types, and the characterization of '$H$', '$U$', and '$Y$' groove patterns are core concepts in this discipline.\n-   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides a set of specific, objective observations and asks for the best-fitting classification from a given set of options. The provided details are sufficient to arrive at a unique and logical conclusion.\n-   **Objectivity:** The language is descriptive and objective, using precise anatomical terms and a quantitative measurement ($0.7$ mm). It is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\nThe problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The premises are factually sound and internally consistent. The data are sufficient and relevant, leading to a verifiable conclusion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived by analyzing the provided morphological evidence.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by systematically interpreting each of the provided observations in the context of mandibular premolar anatomy. While the problem states \"permanent mandibular premolar,\" the features described are classically associated with the **permanent mandibular second premolar**, which is known for its significant variation between two-cusp and three-cusp forms.\n\n1.  **Cusp Number Classification:**\n    -   Observation 1 states there are \"two domed elevations with distinct apices\" on the lingual half of the occlusal table. In dental anatomy, a cusp is a major elevation on the occlusal surface. The presence of two distinct lingual elevations, in addition to the principal buccal cusp inherent to all mandibular premolars, unequivocally indicates a total of three cusps: one buccal cusp, one mesiolingual cusp, and one distolingual cusp.\n    -   Observation 3, \"The mesiolingual elevation is broader than the distolingual elevation,\" further supports the three-cusp classification. In the three-cusp mandibular second premolar, the cusps typically descend in size from buccal to mesiolingual to distolingual.\n    -   Observation 5, a \"square\" occlusal outline, is the characteristic shape for the three-cusp type. The two-cusp type typically presents with a more rounded or oval outline.\n    -   Observation 4, the absence of a \"continuous transverse ridge\" and the termination of the buccal triangular ridge in a \"centrally placed fossa,\" is a definitive feature distinguishing the three-cusp type from the two-cusp type. The two-cusp form is characterized by a prominent transverse ridge connecting the buccal and lingual cusp tips.\n\n    Based on these four consistent observations, the tooth must be classified as a **three-cusp type**. This eliminates options A and B.\n\n2.  **Groove Pattern Identification:**\n    -   The groove pattern is determined by the arrangement of pits and developmental grooves.\n    -   Observation 6 is decisive: \"Three discrete pits are recognizable: one near the center of the occlusal table and one each in the mesial and distal fossae.\"\n    -   The standard groove pattern for a three-cusp mandibular second premolar originates from the central pit. A mesial developmental groove extends from the central pit to the mesial pit. A distal developmental groove extends from the central pit to the distal pit. A lingual developmental groove extends from the central pit lingually, separating the mesiolingual and distolingual cusps.\n    -   This arrangement of three grooves radiating from a common central pit forms a distinct shape that is universally described in dental anatomy as the **'$Y$'-pattern**.\n    -   The '$H$' and '$U$' patterns are associated with the two-cusp form. The '$H$'-pattern has a central developmental groove connecting the mesial and distal pits, which is crossed approximately at its midpoint by a buccolingual groove. The '$U$'-pattern has a crescent-shaped central groove. Neither matches the three-pit description.\n    -   Observation 2, a \"shallow groove crossing onto the lingual surface,\" corresponds to the lingual developmental groove of the '$Y$'-pattern, further confirming this conclusion.\n\n### Synthesis and Conclusion\nThe evidence overwhelmingly points to a three-cusp tooth with a '$Y$'-pattern groove system. The presence of two lingual cusps, a square outline, the absence of a transverse ridge, and, most definitively, the configuration of three occlusal pits (mesial, central, distal) are all classic identifiers of this specific morphological variant.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Two-cusp type with $U$-pattern central groove**\n-   The analysis establishes the tooth is a three-cusp type based on multiple points of evidence (two lingual elevations, square outline, no transverse ridge).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Two-cusp type with $H$-pattern central groove**\n-   The analysis establishes the tooth is a three-cusp type. This classification is therefore incorrect.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Three-cusp type with $Y$-pattern central groove**\n-   This option correctly identifies the tooth as a three-cusp type, consistent with the presence of two lingual cusps. It also correctly identifies the groove pattern as '$Y$', which is the direct consequence of the described three-pit configuration (mesial, distal, central). All provided observations support this conclusion.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Three-cusp type with $H$-pattern central groove**\n-   This option correctly identifies the tooth as a three-cusp type but incorrectly assigns the groove pattern. The '$H$'-pattern is not associated with the three-pit, three-cusp morphology. The described arrangement defines the '$Y$'-pattern.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The mesiodistal width of a tooth is defined as the greatest distance between the mesial and distal contact points, measured along a line perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth. Empirically established norms for the permanent dentition (Bolton overall ratio) indicate a mean of $0.913$ with a clinically acceptable tolerance band of $\\pm 0.015$; an interarch tooth-size discrepancy is considered present when the computed ratio lies outside this band.\n\nYou are provided calibrated measurements (to $0.1$ mm) of the mesiodistal widths for the relevant $12$ teeth in each arch.

The concepts of mesiodistal width, interarch proportionality, and the Bolton ratio are fundamental to clinical practice. The problem is firmly rooted in established scientific and clinical principles.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides an explicit formula for the quantity to be calculated ($R_{overall}$), supplies all necessary numerical data (tooth widths), and presents a clear, unambiguous criterion for making a determination (comparison to a specified tolerance band). A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in objective, quantitative terms, using standard anatomical and clinical terminology. It is free of subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary measurements and definitions are provided. There are no contradictions in the given information.

The problem setup is entirely realistic from a clinical orthodontic perspective.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A solution will be derived based on the provided data and definitions.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first step is to calculate the sum of the mesiodistal widths of the $12$ specified teeth for each arch. Let $S_{max}$ be the sum for the maxillary arch and $S_{mand}$ be the sum for the mandibular arch.\n\nFor the maxillary arch, the sum of the widths is:\n$$\nS_{max} = 8.9 + 6.8 + 7.9 + 7.3 + 7.0 + 10.5 + 8.8 + 6.7 + 7.8 + 7.2 + 7.1 + 10.4\n$$\nSumming these values:\n$$\nS_{max} = 96.4 \\text{ mm}\n$$\n\nFor the mandibular arch, the sum of the widths is:\n$$\nS_{mand} = 5.6 + 6.0 + 6.9 + 7.4 + 7.2 + 11.0 + 5.5 + 6.1 + 6.8 + 7.3 + 7.1 + 10.9\n$$\nSumming these values:\n$$\nS_{mand} = 87.8 \\text{ mm}\n$$\n\nNext, the overall ratio, $R_{overall}$, is computed by dividing the mandibular sum by the maxillary sum:\n$$\nR_{overall} = \\frac{S_{mand}}{S_{max}} = \\frac{87.8}{96.4}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nR_{overall} \\approx 0.9107883817...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_{overall} \\approx 0.9108\n$$\n\nFinally, we must determine if this ratio indicates a clinically significant discrepancy. The criterion for a discrepancy is that the ratio falls outside the clinically acceptable tolerance band. The mean norm is $0.913$ with a tolerance of $\\pm 0.015$.\n\nThe lower limit of the acceptable range is:\n$$\n0.913 - 0.015 = 0.898\n$$\nThe upper limit of the acceptable range is:\n$$\n0.913 + 0.015 = 0.928\n$$\nThus, the clinically acceptable range is $[0.898, 0.928]$.\n\nWe compare the computed ratio, $R_{overall} \\approx 0.9108$, to this range.\nSince $0.898 \\le 0.9108 \\le 0.928$, the calculated ratio falls within the clinically acceptable range.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided measurements and the Bolton overall ratio criterion, no clinically significant interarch tooth-size discrepancy exists. The primary numerical answer requested is the value of the ratio itself.",

            "problem": "An extracted molar crown of unknown arch and dentition presents severe occlusal wear with dentin exposure in the central area. A micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan is used to generate a quantitative enamel thickness map over an occlusal coordinate system where $x$ increases lingually and $y$ increases mesially, with the origin at the geometric center of the worn occlusal table. The enamel thickness field is denoted $t(x,y)$ in millimeters. The following observations are recorded:\n\n1. Four primary local maxima of $t(x,y)$ are detected at approximate coordinates: $(-2.6,\\,2.1)$ with $t=2.0$ mm, $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$ with $t=1.9$ mm, $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ with $t=2.3$ mm, and $(1.9,\\,-1.8)$ with $t=1.8$ mm. A fifth, smaller local maximum occurs at $(2.9,\\,2.5)$ with $t=1.2$ mm.\n\n2. A continuous band where $t(x,y)\\geq 1.5$ mm forms a ridge-like connection between $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ and $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$, across which remnant groove fragments terminate on either side. The gradient $\\nabla t$ along this band is predominantly orthogonal to the band’s axis, indicating a crest rather than a trough.\n\n3. Residual groove paths are identifiable as shallow linear depressions (local minima) in $t(x,y)$ connecting the central worn field to the buccal aspect between $(-2.6,\\,2.1)$ and $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$, and distally toward the lingual aspect near $(1.9,\\,-1.8)$, but these paths are discontinuous where they meet the ridge-like band described in item $2$.\n\n4. Mean enamel thickness near the cervical margins (outside the occlusal table) is $1.7$ mm on the buccal and $1.9$ mm on the lingual, with a pronounced increase toward the cuspal maxima noted above.\n\nUsing only first principles of dental morphology and occlusion—namely, that enamel deposition yields maximal thickness over cusp tips and along transverse ridges while grooves/fossae correspond to relatively thin enamel; that maxillary molars characteristically exhibit an oblique ridge bridging the mesiolingual and distobuccal cusps; that a cusp of Carabelli manifests as an accessory enamel thickening on the palatal aspect of the mesiolingual cusp; that mandibular first molars classically exhibit a $Y$-shaped groove pattern with $5$ cusps, and mandibular second molars a cross ($+$) groove pattern with $4$ cusps; and that primary teeth overall have thinner enamel than permanent teeth, infer the most consistent original cusp and ridge architecture of this crown before wear.\n\nWhich reconstruction best fits the observations?\n\nA. Permanent maxillary first molar with $4$ principal cusps (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, distolingual), a well-developed oblique ridge from mesiolingual to distobuccal, and an accessory cusp of Carabelli on the mesiolingual cusp.\n\nB. Primary maxillary second molar that resembles the permanent maxillary first molar but has uniformly thin enamel (approximately $1.0$ mm) and lacks an oblique ridge.\n\nC. Permanent mandibular first molar with $5$ cusps arranged in a $Y$-pattern central groove and no oblique ridge, with dominant enamel thickness over buccal functional cusps.\n\nD. Permanent mandibular second molar with $4$ cusps and a cross ($+$) central groove pattern, lacking an oblique ridge and any accessory palatal cusp.",
            "solution": "The task is to reconstruct the original occlusal architecture by applying core definitions that relate enamel thickness to cusp locations and ridge presence, and groove paths to zones of thinner enamel. We begin from the following foundational facts:\n\n1. Enamel thickness is greatest over cusp tips and along pronounced ridges; grooves and fossae correspond to thinner enamel. Thus, local maxima of $t(x,y)$ mark cusp tips or accessory cusp areas, while continuous bands of elevated $t$ delineate transverse or oblique ridges.\n\n2. In maxillary molars, an oblique ridge uniquely connects the mesiolingual cusp to the distobuccal cusp. Mandibular molars do not have an oblique ridge; instead, mandibular first molars classically present a $Y$-shaped groove pattern with $5$ cusps, and mandibular second molars present $4$ cusps with a cross ($+$) groove pattern.\n\n3. The cusp of Carabelli is an accessory cusp (or tubercle) on the palatal aspect of the mesiolingual cusp of maxillary first molars, often reflected as an accessory enamel thickness maximum on the palatal side of the mesiolingual cusp.\n\n4. Primary teeth have thinner enamel overall than permanent teeth; typical maximum occlusal enamel thickness is lower in primary molars (often near $1.0$–$1.2$ mm at cusps) compared to permanent molars (often exceeding $1.5$–$2.0$ mm at cusps), recognizing anatomical variability.\n\nWe now interpret the given data:\n\n- The four principal local maxima at $(-2.6,\\,2.1)$ with $t=2.0$ mm, $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$ with $t=1.9$ mm, $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ with $t=2.3$ mm, and $(1.9,\\,-1.8)$ with $t=1.8$ mm plausibly represent the four main cusps of a molar. The coordinate system defines $x>0$ as lingual and $x<0$ as buccal. Therefore, the two maxima with negative $x$ values are buccal cusps (mesiobuccal at $(-2.6,\\,2.1)$ and distobuccal at $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$), and the two maxima with positive $x$ values are lingual cusps (mesiolingual at $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ and distolingual at $(1.9,\\,-1.8)$). The largest maximum $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ with $t=2.3$ mm is consistent with the mesiolingual cusp of a maxillary molar, which is typically prominent.\n\n- The fifth smaller maximum at $(2.9,\\,2.5)$ with $t=1.2$ mm lies palatal (lingual) and mesial to the mesiolingual cusp, consistent with an accessory cusp of Carabelli on the palatal aspect of the mesiolingual cusp. Its reduced amplitude compared to principal cusps aligns with a Carabelli tubercle rather than a full principal cusp.\n\n- A continuous band of elevated $t(x,y)\\geq 1.5$ mm forms a ridge-like connection between $(2.1,\\,2.0)$ (mesiolingual) and $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$ (distobuccal). The gradient $\\nabla t$ being orthogonal to the band’s axis indicates a crest (ridge) rather than a trough. This is the hallmark of the maxillary oblique ridge running from the mesiolingual to the distobuccal cusp. Residual groove paths being discontinuous where they meet this band further supports the presence of a ridge interrupting groove continuity, as seen with the distal oblique groove being interrupted by the oblique ridge in maxillary molars.\n\n- The mean enamel thickness near cervical margins being $1.7$ mm buccally and $1.9$ mm lingually, with cusp maxima up to $2.3$ mm, favors a permanent tooth rather than a primary tooth, which would exhibit substantially thinner enamel overall (commonly near $1.0$–$1.2$ mm at cuspal peaks and thinner cervically).\n\n- The residual groove paths include a buccal groove between $(-2.6,\\,2.1)$ and $(-2.7,\\,-2.1)$ (buccal grooves between the buccal cusps are typical in maxillary molars) and a distal-lingual groove toward $(1.9,\\,-1.8)$ that is interrupted by the oblique ridge, again matching the maxillary pattern.\n\nFrom these interpretations, the architecture is most consistent with a permanent maxillary first molar featuring four principal cusps, an oblique ridge from mesiolingual to distobuccal, and a cusp of Carabelli.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. Permanent maxillary first molar with $4$ principal cusps (mesiobuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, distolingual), a well-developed oblique ridge from mesiolingual to distobuccal, and an accessory cusp of Carabelli on the mesiolingual cusp. This exactly matches the observed data: four principal maxima in positions appropriate for a maxillary molar, a ridge connecting the mesiolingual and distobuccal cusps, and an accessory palatal maximum consistent with a Carabelli cusp. The enamel thickness values ($2.0$–$2.3$ mm maxima; cervical $1.7$–$1.9$ mm) align with a permanent tooth. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Primary maxillary second molar that resembles the permanent maxillary first molar but has uniformly thin enamel (approximately $1.0$ mm) and lacks an oblique ridge. While primary maxillary second molars can resemble permanent maxillary first molars in cusp arrangement, the measured enamel is not uniformly thin and demonstrates maxima up to $2.3$ mm and a distinct oblique ridge. The stipulated absence of an oblique ridge contradicts the ridge band observed. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. Permanent mandibular first molar with $5$ cusps arranged in a $Y$-pattern central groove and no oblique ridge, with dominant enamel thickness over buccal functional cusps. The data show only four principal maxima plus a small accessory palatal maximum, not the canonical five-cusp arrangement. The presence of an oblique ridge (mesial-lingual to disto-buccal) is a maxillary feature absent in mandibular molars. The groove pattern is interrupted by the ridge rather than forming a $Y$-pattern. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Permanent mandibular second molar with $4$ cusps and a cross ($+$) central groove pattern, lacking an oblique ridge and any accessory palatal cusp. The observed oblique ridge and the accessory palatal enamel maximum are incompatible with a mandibular second molar; the cross groove pattern is also not supported by the interrupted groove network described. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the reconstruction most consistent with the measurements and morphological principles is that of a permanent maxillary first molar with an oblique ridge and a cusp of Carabelli.",
