The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The data provided for the red blood cell (RBC) membrane properties and the arteriolar shear rate are physically realistic and consistent.\n\nThe task is to derive and calculate the Deborah number, $De$, for an RBC membrane subjected to simple shear. The Deborah number is defined as the ratio of the material's relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, to the characteristic time of the observation or process, $t_{proc}$.\n$$\nDe = \\frac{t_{relax}}{t_{proc}}\n$$\nWe must determine both $t_{relax}$ and $t_{proc}$ from the information given.\n\nFirst, we determine the relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, for the RBC membrane. The membrane is modeled as a two-dimensional Maxwell element, which consists of an elastic component (a spring) and a viscous component (a dashpot) arranged in series.\nLet $\\tau_s$ be the surface shear stress and $\\gamma_s$ be the surface shear strain. The total shear strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_s$, is the sum of the elastic strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e}$, and the viscous strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}$.\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_s = \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e} + \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the elastic and viscous components are given by:\nFor the elastic component (surface shear modulus $G_s$): $\\tau_s = G_s \\gamma_{s,e}$, which upon differentiation with respect to time gives $\\dot{\\tau}_s = G_s \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e}$, or $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e} = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt}$.\nFor the viscous component (surface viscosity $\\mu_s$): $\\tau_s = \\mu_s \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}$, which gives $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v} = \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\mu_s}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for the total strain rate gives the constitutive equation for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_s = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} + \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\mu_s}\n$$\nTo find the relaxation time, we consider a stress relaxation experiment. A constant strain, $\\gamma_0$, is applied at time $t=0$ and held constant for $t>0$. This implies that the strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_s = 0$ for $t>0$. The constitutive equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} + \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\mu_s}\n$$\nRearranging this first-order ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} = -\\frac{G_s}{\\mu_s} \\tau_s\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay function for the stress:\n$$\n\\tau_s(t) = \\tau_s(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_s}{\\mu_s} t\\right)\n$$\nThe relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, is the time constant of this exponential decay, which is the time it takes for the stress to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value. By inspection, the relaxation time for the Maxwell model is:\n$$\nt_{relax} = \\frac{\\mu_s}{G_s}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the characteristic process time, $t_{proc}$. The problem states that the RBC is in a field of steady simple shear with a shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$. The shear rate has units of inverse time ($s^{-1}$) and represents the rate of angular deformation of the fluid. The characteristic time scale of this flow process is the inverse of the magnitude of the shear rate.\n$$\nt_{proc} = \\frac{1}{\\dot{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis time scale represents the time over which a fluid element undergoes a shear strain of order unity.\n\nNow we can derive the symbolic expression for the Deborah number by substituting the expressions for $t_{relax}$ and $t_{proc}$ into its definition:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{t_{relax}}{t_{proc}} = \\frac{\\mu_s / G_s}{1 / \\dot{\\gamma}}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{\\mu_s \\dot{\\gamma}}{G_s}\n$$\nThis is the required symbolic expression for the Deborah number in terms of the given parameters.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $De$ using the provided data:\nSurface shear modulus: $G_s = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}$\nMembrane surface viscosity: $\\mu_s = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot s/m}$\nArteriolar shear rate: $\\dot{\\gamma} = 400\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the symbolic expression:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{N \\cdot s/m}) \\times (400\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{N/m}}\n$$\nThe units cancel out, confirming that $De$ is a dimensionless number:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 400}{6.0 \\times 10^{-6}} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{-5}}{6.0 \\times 10^{-6}}\n$$\n$$\nDe = \\frac{4.0}{6.0} \\times 10^{-5 - (-6)} = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 10^{1} = \\frac{20}{3}\n$$\n$$\nDe \\approx 6.666...\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nDe \\approx 6.67\n$$\nA Deborah number greater than $1$ indicates that the material's response is predominantly elastic, or solid-like, as the material does not have sufficient time to relax (flow) on the timescale of the imposed deformation.

The model of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane as a two-dimensional viscoelastic continuum with shear elasticity derived from a spectrin network is a cornerstone of cell biomechanics. The provided numerical values are physically realistic. Therefore, a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, to derive the scaling relationships for the effective surface shear modulus $G_s$ and the characteristic shear relaxation time $\\tau$ with respect to the areal spectrin link density $\\rho$; second, to apply these scaling laws to calculate the new quantitative values after the specified reduction in $\\rho$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Scaling Laws**\n\n**Scaling of the Surface Shear Modulus ($G_s$)**\nThe problem states that the in-plane shear elasticity originates from a network of spectrin links, which act as entropic springs. The macroscopic effective surface shear modulus, $G_s$, is an emergent property of this microscopic network. The elastic strain energy per unit area, $W$, for an applied shear strain $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} G_s \\gamma^2$$\nFrom a microscopic perspective, this total energy is the sum of the energies stored in individual spectrin links within that unit area. If $\\rho$ is the areal density of links and $E_{link}$ is the average energy stored per link, then:\n$$W = \\rho E_{link}$$\nThe energy stored in a single spring is proportional to its stiffness, $k$, and the square of the strain it experiences. For a given macroscopic strain $\\gamma$, the microscopic strains on the links are also proportional to $\\gamma$. Thus, $E_{link} \\propto k \\gamma^2$. Combining these, we find:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} G_s \\gamma^2 \\propto \\rho k \\gamma^2$$\nThis implies that the shear modulus is directly proportional to both the density of the elastic elements and their individual stiffness:\n$$G_s \\propto \\rho k$$\nThe problem states that the per-link stiffness $k$ is unaltered by the defect. Therefore, the scaling relationship for the shear modulus is:\n$$G_s \\propto \\rho$$\n\n**Scaling of the Characteristic Shear Relaxation Time ($\\tau$)**\nThe problem describes the membrane as a viscoelastic continuum and asks for the characteristic shear relaxation time, $\\tau$. In linear viscoelasticity, a simple and fundamental model is the Maxwell model, which describes a material that exhibits both elastic and viscous responses. The characteristic relaxation time in such a material represents the time required for stress to relax by a factor of $1/e$ under constant strain. This time is defined by the ratio of the material's viscosity to its elastic modulus. For a two-dimensional surface, this is:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\mu_s}{G_s}$$\nwhere $\\mu_s$ is the effective surface viscosity and $G_s$ is the effective surface shear modulus.\nThe problem explicitly states that $\\mu_s$ is insensitive to the change in network connectivity, meaning it can be treated as a constant. We have already established that $G_s \\propto \\rho$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\tau$ yields the scaling relationship:\n$$\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{G_s} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\rho}$$\nTherefore, the characteristic shear relaxation time is inversely proportional to the spectrin link density.\n\n**2. Calculation of New Values**\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by a subscript $0$ and the new state (after the defect) by a subscript $1$. The initial values are $\\rho_0$, $G_{s}^{(0)}$, and $\\tau_0$. The new values are $\\rho_1$, $G_{s}^{(1)}$, and $\\tau_1$.\nThe problem states that the spectrin link density $\\rho$ is reduced by $0.20$. This means a $20\\%$ reduction:\n$$\\rho_1 = \\rho_0 - 0.20 \\rho_0 = (1 - 0.20) \\rho_0 = 0.80 \\rho_0$$\n\n**Calculation of the new Surface Shear Modulus ($G_s^{(1)}$)**\nUsing the scaling law $G_s \\propto \\rho$, we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{G_s^{(1)}}{G_s^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{0.80 \\rho_0}{\\rho_0} = 0.80$$\nThe qualitative change is a decrease in stiffness. The new shear modulus is:\n$$G_s^{(1)} = 0.80 \\times G_s^{(0)}$$\nGiven the baseline value $G_s^{(0)} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m:\n$$G_s^{(1)} = 0.80 \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}) = 4.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $G_s^{(1)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m.\n\n**Calculation of the new Relaxation Time ($\\tau_1$)**\nUsing the scaling law $\\tau \\propto 1/\\rho$, we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_1}{\\tau_0} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{0.80 \\rho_0} = \\frac{1}{0.80} = 1.25$$\nThe qualitative change is an increase in relaxation time. A less stiff network takes longer to relax. To find the quantitative value, we can either calculate the initial relaxation time $\\tau_0$ and scale it, or calculate $\\tau_1$ directly using the new modulus $G_s^{(1)}$. We will use the direct method as it is more straightforward.\nThe relaxation time is given by $\\tau_1 = \\frac{\\mu_s}{G_s^{(1)}}$.\nThe viscosity is given as $\\mu_s = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ N·s/m. We calculated $G_s^{(1)} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m.\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{N·s/m}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}} = \\frac{1.5}{4.8} \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{s}$$\n$$\\tau_1 = 0.3125 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{s} = 0.03125 \\, \\text{s}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau_1 = 0.0313 \\, \\text{s}$$\n\nIn summary, the reduction in spectrin link density leads to a softer membrane (lower $G_s$) that relaxes more slowly (higher $\\tau$).\nThe final numerical answers are $G_s^{(1)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m and $\\tau_1 = 0.0313$ s.",

Theoretical angle: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{th}}(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\arccos(\\frac{1}{1.96}) \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\arccos(0.51020) \\approx 0.51775$ radians.\n4. Measured angle: $\\theta_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.51775 - 0.02 = 0.49775$ radians.\n5. Tolerance: $\\Delta\\theta_{\\mathrm{tol}}(1.5) = (0.05)(0.51775) + 0.01 \\approx 0.03589$.\n6. Validation: $|\\theta_{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\theta_{\\mathrm{th}}(1.5)| = |-0.02| = 0.02$. Since $0.02 \\le 0.03589$, the result is **Pass (True)**.\n\n**Test Case 6:** $(\\lambda, r, \\kappa) = (5.0, 1.2, 0.8)$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\theta_{\\mathrm{th}}(5.0) + 0.0337$.\n1.
