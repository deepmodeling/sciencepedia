The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and definitions to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution.

The Deborah number is defined as the ratio of the material's relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, to the characteristic time of the observation or process, $t_{proc}$.\n$$\nDe = \\frac{t_{relax}}{t_{proc}}\n$$\nWe must determine both $t_{relax}$ and $t_{proc}$ from the information given.\n\nFirst, we determine the relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, for the RBC membrane. The membrane is modeled as a two-dimensional Maxwell element, which consists of an elastic component (a spring) and a viscous component (a dashpot) arranged in series.\nLet $\\tau_s$ be the surface shear stress and $\\gamma_s$ be the surface shear strain. The total shear strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_s$, is the sum of the elastic strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e}$, and the viscous strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}$.\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_s = \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e} + \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}\n$$\nThe constitutive relations for the elastic and viscous components are given by:\nFor the elastic component (surface shear modulus $G_s$): $\\tau_s = G_s \\gamma_{s,e}$, which upon differentiation with respect to time gives $\\dot{\\tau}_s = G_s \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e}$, or $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,e} = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt}$.\nFor the viscous component (surface viscosity $\\eta_m$): $\\tau_s = \\eta_m \\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v}$, which gives $\\dot{\\gamma}_{s,v} = \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\eta_m}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for the total strain rate gives the constitutive equation for the Maxwell model:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}_s = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} + \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\eta_m}\n$$\nTo find the relaxation time, we consider a stress relaxation experiment. A constant strain, $\\gamma_0$, is applied at time $t=0$ and held constant for $t>0$. This implies that the strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_s = 0$ for $t>0$. The constitutive equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{G_s} \\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} + \\frac{\\tau_s}{\\eta_m}\n$$\nRearranging this first-order ordinary differential equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_s}{dt} = -\\frac{G_s}{\\eta_m} \\tau_s\n$$\nThe solution to this equation is an exponential decay function for the stress:\n$$\n\\tau_s(t) = \\tau_s(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_s}{\\eta_m} t\\right)\n$$\nThe relaxation time, $t_{relax}$, is the time constant of this exponential decay, which is the time it takes for the stress to decay to $1/e$ of its initial value. By inspection, the relaxation time for the Maxwell model is:\n$$\nt_{relax} = \\frac{\\eta_m}{G_s}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the characteristic process time, $t_{proc}$. The problem states that the RBC is in a field of steady simple shear with a shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$.

The model of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane as a two-dimensional viscoelastic continuum with shear elasticity derived from a spectrin network is a cornerstone of cell biomechanics. The provided numerical values are physically realistic. Therefore, a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution requires two main steps: first, to derive the scaling relationships for the effective surface shear modulus $G_s$ and the characteristic shear relaxation time $\\tau$ with respect to the areal spectrin link density $\\rho$; second, to apply these scaling laws to calculate the new quantitative values after the specified reduction in $\\rho$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Scaling Laws**\n\n**Scaling of the Surface Shear Modulus ($G_s$)**\nThe problem states that the in-plane shear elasticity originates from a network of spectrin links, which act as entropic springs. The macroscopic effective surface shear modulus, $G_s$, is an emergent property of this microscopic network. The elastic strain energy per unit area, $W$, for an applied shear strain $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$W = \\frac{1}{2} G_s \\gamma^2$$\nFrom a microscopic perspective, this total energy is the sum of the energies stored in individual spectrin links within that unit area. If $\\rho$ is the areal density of links and $E_{link}$ is the average energy stored per link, then:\n$$W = \\rho E_{link}$$\nThe energy stored in a single spring is proportional to its stiffness, $k$, and the square of the strain it experiences. For a given macroscopic strain $\\gamma$, the microscopic strains on the links are also proportional to $\\gamma$. Thus, $E_{link} \\propto k \\gamma^2$. Combining these, we find:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} G_s \\gamma^2 \\propto \\rho k \\gamma^2$$\nThis implies that the shear modulus is directly proportional to both the density of the elastic elements and their individual stiffness:\n$$G_s \\propto \\rho k$$\nThe problem states that the per-link stiffness $k$ is unaltered by the defect. Therefore, the scaling relationship for the shear modulus is:\n$$G_s \\propto \\rho$$\n\n**Scaling of the Characteristic Shear Relaxation Time ($\\tau$)**\nThe problem describes the membrane as a viscoelastic continuum and asks for the characteristic shear relaxation time, $\\tau$. In linear viscoelasticity, a simple and fundamental model is the Maxwell model, which describes a material that exhibits both elastic and viscous responses. The characteristic relaxation time in such a material represents the time required for stress to relax by a factor of $1/e$ under constant strain. This time is defined by the ratio of the material's viscosity to its elastic modulus. For a two-dimensional surface, this is:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{\\mu_s}{G_s}$$\nwhere $\\mu_s$ is the effective surface viscosity and $G_s$ is the effective surface shear modulus.\nThe problem explicitly states that $\\mu_s$ is insensitive to the change in network connectivity, meaning it can be treated as a constant. We have already established that $G_s \\propto \\rho$. Substituting this into the equation for $\\tau$ yields the scaling relationship:\n$$\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{G_s} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\rho}$$\nTherefore, the characteristic shear relaxation time is inversely proportional to the spectrin link density.\n\n**2. Calculation of New Values**\n\nLet the initial state be denoted by a subscript $0$ and the new state (after the defect) by a subscript $1$. The initial values are $\\rho_0$, $G_{s}^{(0)}$, and $\\tau_0$. The new values are $\\rho_1$, $G_{s}^{(1)}$, and $\\tau_1$.\nThe problem states that the spectrin link density $\\rho$ is reduced by $0.20$. This means a $20\\%$ reduction:\n$$\\rho_1 = \\rho_0 - 0.20 \\rho_0 = (1 - 0.20) \\rho_0 = 0.80 \\rho_0$$\n\n**Calculation of the new Surface Shear Modulus ($G_s^{(1)}$)**\nUsing the scaling law $G_s \\propto \\rho$, we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{G_s^{(1)}}{G_s^{(0)}} = \\frac{\\rho_1}{\\rho_0} = \\frac{0.80 \\rho_0}{\\rho_0} = 0.80$$\nThe qualitative change is a decrease in stiffness. The new shear modulus is:\n$$G_s^{(1)} = 0.80 \\times G_s^{(0)}$$\nGiven the baseline value $G_s^{(0)} = 6.0 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m:\n$$G_s^{(1)} = 0.80 \\times (6.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}) = 4.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $G_s^{(1)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m.\n\n**Calculation of the new Relaxation Time ($\\tau_1$)**\nUsing the scaling law $\\tau \\propto 1/\\rho$, we can write the ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\tau_1}{\\tau_0} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{\\rho_1} = \\frac{\\rho_0}{0.80 \\rho_0} = \\frac{1}{0.80} = 1.25$$\nThe qualitative change is an increase in relaxation time. A less stiff network takes longer to relax. To find the quantitative value, we can either calculate the initial relaxation time $\\tau_0$ and scale it, or calculate $\\tau_1$ directly using the new modulus $G_s^{(1)}$. We will use the direct method as it is more straightforward.\nThe relaxation time is given by $\\tau_1 = \\frac{\\mu_s}{G_s^{(1)}}$.\nThe viscosity is given as $\\mu_s = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}$ N·s/m. We calculated $G_s^{(1)} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m.\n$$\\tau_1 = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{N·s/m}}{4.8 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{N/m}} = \\frac{1.5}{4.8} \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{s}$$\n$$\\tau_1 = 0.3125 \\times 10^{-1} \\, \\text{s} = 0.03125 \\, \\text{s}$$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\\tau_1 = 0.0313 \\, \\text{s}$$\n\nIn summary, the reduction in spectrin link density leads to a softer membrane (lower $G_s$) that relaxes more slowly (higher $\\tau$).\nThe final numerical answers are $G_s^{(1)} = 4.80 \\times 10^{-6}$ N/m and $\\tau_1 = 0.0313$ s.",

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a standard rheological experiment, laser-diffraction ektacytometry, used to characterize the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs). The validity of the problem is confirmed as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, describing a real-world biomechanical measurement technique and its theoretical basis without inconsistencies or factual errors.\n\nThe goal is to relate the measured output of the ektacytometer—an elliptical diffraction pattern—to the intrinsic mechanical properties of the RBC membrane. This requires establishing the correct theoretical framework, which connects the applied forces, the material response, and the measured quantities.\n\nFirst principles analysis:\n1.  **Flow and Stress**: The problem specifies a simple shear flow. In the cone-plate geometry of the ektacytometer, a nearly uniform shear rate, denoted by $\\dot{\\gamma}$, is applied to the dilute cell suspension. The flow is characterized by a very low Reynolds number, so it is a creeping flow governed by the Stokes equation. The shear stress, $\\tau$, exerted by the suspending fluid on the surface of the RBCs is the primary driver of deformation. This stress is given by the product of the suspending fluid's dynamic viscosity, $\\mu_f$, and the shear rate:\n    $$ \\tau = \\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma} $$\n    The problem correctly notes that a high-molecular-weight polymer solution is used, which serves to increase $\\mu_f$, thereby allowing significant shear stresses to be generated at achievable shear rates. The viscosity $\\mu_f$ is temperature-dependent and must be known at the measurement temperature.\n\n2.  **Membrane Elastic Response**: The RBC membrane is a composite structure that, for in-plane deformations at constant surface area, behaves primarily as a two-dimensional viscoelastic solid. The elastic component of its response to in-plane shear is characterized by the surface shear modulus, $G_s$ (also denoted $\\mu_s$). For small deformations, the theory of linear elasticity applies. At steady state, the deforming viscous stress from the external flow is balanced by the internal elastic restoring stress of the membrane. This equilibrium dictates that the degree of deformation is proportional to the applied stress and inversely proportional to the membrane's stiffness. For a measure of strain or elongation, $EI$, this relationship is:\n    $$ EI \\propto \\frac{\\tau}{G_s} $$\n    Substituting the expression for $\\tau$, we get:\n    $$ EI \\propto \\frac{\\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma}}{G_s} $$\n    The bending modulus, $\\kappa_b$, primarily governs out-of-plane deformations and resistance to bending, while a 3D Young's modulus, $E_Y$, is not the appropriate parameter for a quasi-2D membrane structure under shear. The internal (cytosolic) viscosity, $\\mu_{cyto}$, affects the dynamics of deformation and the rate of membrane tank-treading, but the external stress is determined by $\\mu_f$.\n\n3.  **Measurement and Elongation Index (EI)**: The ektacytometer measures the collective light diffraction from a population of sheared, elongated cells. Due to the principles of Fourier optics, an elongated cell with a major axis along a certain direction produces a diffraction pattern that is elongated in the perpendicular direction. The standard quantitative measure of the shape of this diffraction ellipse is the Elongation Index, $EI$, defined as:\n    $$ EI = \\frac{L - W}{L + W} $$\n    where $L$ and $W$ are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the diffraction ellipse, respectively. This normalized index varies from $0$ for a circle (undeformed cells) to a theoretical maximum of $1$.\n\n4.  **Instrumental Correction**: A real optical instrument has a finite resolution, characterized by its point-spread function (PSF). This causes a blurring of the image, which in this context means the measured diameters of the diffraction ellipse, $l_m$ and $w_m$, are larger than the true diameters, $L$ and $W$. For accurate results, especially at low shear where deformation is small, this instrumental broadening must be corrected. If the PSF and the true diffraction profiles are approximated as Gaussian, the broadening effect is additive in the square of the diameters (deconvolution by subtraction in quadrature):\n    $$ l_m^2 \\approx L^2 + l_{psf}^2 $$\n    $$ w_m^2 \\approx W^2 + w_{psf}^2 $$\n    Here, $l_{psf}$ and $w_{psf}$ are the characteristic widths of the instrument's PSF along the principal axes. To obtain the true diameters required for the $EI$ calculation, one must perform this deconvolution:\n    $$ L = \\sqrt{l_m^2 - l_{psf}^2} $$\n    $$ W = \\sqrt{w_m^2 - w_{psf}^2} $$\n\nSummary of procedure to find $G_s$: Measure $l_m$ and $w_m$ at various $\\dot{\\gamma}$. For each measurement, use the known PSF to calculate the true $L$ and $W$, then compute $EI$. Also, calculate the corresponding stress $\\tau = \\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma}$ using the measured fluid viscosity $\\mu_f$. A plot of $EI$ versus $\\tau$ should be linear for small deformations, and the slope of this line is inversely proportional to $G_s$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\nA. The elongation index is defined as $EI=(L-W)/(L+W)$, where $L$ and $W$ are the principal diameters of the diffraction ellipse after correcting the measured diameters $l_m$ and $w_m$ for the instrument’s optical blur using a known point-spread function, for example via $L^2\\approx l_m^2-l_{psf}^2$ and $W^2\\approx w_m^2-w_{psf}^2$. In the small-deformation regime under simple shear at rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$, $EI$ is proportional to the applied viscous shear stress $\\tau$ with $EI\\propto \\tau/G_s$, where $\\tau=\\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma}$ uses the actual suspending medium viscosity $\\mu_f$ at the measurement temperature and $G_s$ is an effective membrane surface shear modulus; obtaining $G_s$ from the slope of $EI$ versus $\\tau$ thus requires both the optical correction for $L$ and $W$ and the viscosity correction for $\\mu_f$.\n\nThis option correctly states the standard definition of $EI$. It correctly identifies the necessity of correcting the measured diameters ($l_m, w_m$) for the instrumental PSF and provides the correct mathematical form for this correction ($L^2 \\approx l_m^2 - l_{psf}^2$). It correctly describes the linear relationship $EI \\propto \\tau/G_s$ in the small-deformation regime, identifies $G_s$ as the relevant elastic parameter (surface shear modulus), and correctly defines the shear stress as $\\tau = \\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma}$. Finally, it accurately concludes that both the optical and viscosity corrections are necessary to extract $G_s$. This statement is fully consistent with the established theory and practice of ektacytometry.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. The elongation index is defined as $EI=(L/W)^2-1$ using the raw measured diffraction diameters without optical correction. In steady simple shear, $EI$ is independent of the suspending medium viscosity and depends primarily on the membrane bending modulus $\\kappa_b$ as $EI\\propto \\tau/\\kappa_b$.\n\nThis option is incorrect on several grounds. The definition of $EI$ is non-standard. It incorrectly states that no optical correction is needed. It makes the fundamentally incorrect claim that $EI$ is independent of the suspending medium viscosity $\\mu_f$; in fact, the deformation is directly driven by the stress $\\tau = \\mu_f \\dot{\\gamma}$. Finally, it incorrectly identifies the bending modulus $\\kappa_b$ as the primary elastic parameter resisting shear elongation, whereas the shear modulus $G_s$ is the relevant property.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. The elongation index equals the ratio of the principal axes $EI=L/W$ and is independent of shear rate because red blood cell volume is conserved. Any attempt to infer an elastic modulus must correct only for the cytosolic viscosity, since the external medium viscosity merely affects flow outside the cell.\n\nThis option is also incorrect on multiple points. The definition $EI=L/W$ (aspect ratio) is not the standard elongation index. The claim that $EI$ is independent of shear rate is fundamentally false; the entire purpose of the technique is to measure deformation as a function of applied stress, which varies with shear rate. The reasoning about volume conservation is a non sequitur. The assertion that one must correct \"only for the cytosolic viscosity\" and that the external viscosity is irrelevant is backward; the external viscosity $\\mu_f$ determines the deforming stress and is of primary importance.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. The elongation index is $EI=(L-W)/(L+W)$ computed from the raw measured diffraction ellipse diameters $l_m$ and $w_m$ without optical deconvolution. In steady shear, the effective stress controlling $EI$ is $\\tau=(\\mu_f+\\mu_{cyto})\\dot{\\gamma}$, the sum of suspending and cytosolic viscosities times shear rate, so $EI\\propto \\tau/E_Y$ where $E_Y$ is an effective Young’s modulus.\n\nThis option uses the correct formula for $EI$ but makes several critical errors. It incorrectly states that the calculation should use raw diameters without optical correction. It proposes a physically incorrect formula for the effective stress, $\\tau=(\\mu_f+\\mu_{cyto})\\dot{\\gamma}$; the internal and external viscosities cannot be simply added in this manner. The deforming stress is proportional to $\\mu_f$, while the ratio $\\mu_{cyto}/\\mu_f$ affects the cell's orientation and tank-treading frequency but not in this simple additive way. Lastly, it identifies the relevant modulus as a Young's modulus $E_Y$, which is inappropriate for the in-plane shear of a 2D membrane.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
