            "problem": "A non-Newtonian biofluid (e.g., synovial fluid) in the International System of Units (SI) is modeled by the Carreau–Yasuda constitutive relation for shear-dependent viscosity. Let the dynamic viscosity be denoted by $\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})$, where $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate. The Carreau–Yasuda model involves the parameters $\\mu_{0}$ (zero-shear viscosity), $\\mu_{\\infty}$ (infinite-shear viscosity), $\\lambda$ (a characteristic time), $a$ (the Yasuda parameter), and $n$ (the power-law index), and is widely used to describe shear-thinning in biological fluids.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of a specific dimensionless group from a set of physical variables that characterize a non-Newtonian biofluid. The analysis will be performed using the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem.\n\nFirst, we list the set of all relevant physical variables and parameters as provided in the problem statement:\n$\\{\\mu, \\mu_{0}, \\mu_{\\infty}, \\dot{\\gamma}, \\lambda, a, n\\}$.\nHere, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\\mu_{0}$ is the zero-shear viscosity, $\\mu_{\\infty}$ is the infinite-shear viscosity, $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate, $\\lambda$ is a characteristic time, $a$ is the Yasuda parameter, and $n$ is the power-law index.\n\nThe problem states that the parameters $a$ and $n$ are dimensionless. In the context of the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem, any variable that is already dimensionless is itself a $\\pi$-group. Thus, we can set $\\Pi_1 = a$ and $\\Pi_2 = n$ and remove them from the primary dimensional analysis procedure.\n\nWe are left with a set of $k=5$ variables that possess physical dimensions: $\\{\\mu, \\mu_{0}, \\mu_{\\infty}, \\dot{\\gamma}, \\lambda\\}$.\nThe fundamental base dimensions are given as mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$). We now express the dimensions of each of these $k=5$ variables in terms of these base dimensions, based on the provided SI units.\n\n1.  Viscosity ($\\mu$, $\\mu_0$, $\\mu_\\infty$): The unit is $\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$. A Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$) is a unit of pressure, which is force per unit area. Force is mass times acceleration ($\\mathrm{N} = \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$). So, $\\mathrm{Pa} = \\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-2} = \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$. Therefore, the unit of viscosity is $(\\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-2})\\cdot\\mathrm{s} = \\mathrm{kg}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In terms of fundamental dimensions, this is $M L^{-1} T^{-1}$.\n    $$[\\mu] = [\\mu_0] = [\\mu_\\infty] = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$$\n2.  Shear Rate ($\\dot{\\gamma}$): The unit is $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The dimension is $T^{-1}$.\n    $$[\\dot{\\gamma}] = T^{-1}$$\n3.  Characteristic Time ($\\lambda$): The unit is $\\mathrm{s}$. The dimension is $T$.\n    $$[\\lambda] = T$$\n\nNext, we apply the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem. The number of dimensional variables is $k=5$. We must determine the number of fundamental dimensions, $j$, that are independent within this set of variables. We construct the dimensional matrix with dimensions as rows and variables as columns:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccccc}\n  \\mu  \\mu_0  \\mu_\\infty  \\dot{\\gamma}  \\lambda \\\\\n\\hline\nM  1  1  1  0  0 \\\\\nL  -1  -1  -1  0  0 \\\\\nT  -1  -1  -1  -1  1\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe rank of this matrix, $j$, is the number of independent dimensions. We can observe that the first row is equal to the negative of the second row (Row 1 = -1 $\\times$ Row 2), which indicates they are linearly dependent. The third row is linearly independent of the first two. Therefore, the rank of the matrix is $j=2$. The number of independent dimensionless groups ($\\pi$-groups) is $p = k - j = 5 - 2 = 3$.\n\nTo find these $\\pi$-groups, we must select a set of $j=2$ repeating variables. These variables must, together, contain all of the fundamental dimensions, and they must be dimensionally independent of each other. A suitable choice is $\\mu_0$ (the zero-shear viscosity, a fundamental material property) and $\\lambda$ (the material's intrinsic relaxation time). Let's verify their dimensional independence.\n$$[\\mu_0] = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$$\n$$[\\lambda] = T$$\nThese cannot be combined in any way with exponents $c_1, c_2$ to form a dimensionless quantity (i.e., $[\\mu_0]^{c_1} [\\lambda]^{c_2}$ is dimensionless only if $c_1=c_2=0$), so they are dimensionally independent. They also contain the dimensional information of $M L^{-1}$ and $T$, which spans the dimensional space of our problem.\n\nNow we form the three $\\pi$-groups by combining each of the remaining variables ($\\mu$, $\\mu_\\infty$, $\\dot{\\gamma}$) with the repeating variables $\\mu_0$ and $\\lambda$.\n\n1.  $\\pi$-group for $\\mu$:\n    Let $\\Pi_3 = \\mu \\cdot (\\mu_0)^{c_1} \\cdot (\\lambda)^{c_2}$. For $\\Pi_3$ to be dimensionless, its dimensions must be $M^0 L^0 T^0$.\n    $$[M^0 L^0 T^0] = (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) \\cdot (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^{c_1} \\cdot (T)^{c_2} = M^{1+c_1} L^{-1-c_1} T^{-1-c_1+c_2}$$\n    Equating the exponents for each dimension:\n    For $M$: $1 + c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = -1$.\n    For $L$: $-1 - c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = -1$ (consistent).\n    For $T$: $-1 - c_1 + c_2 = 0 \\implies -1 - (-1) + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\Pi_3 = \\mu \\cdot (\\mu_0)^{-1} \\cdot (\\lambda)^0 = \\frac{\\mu}{\\mu_0}$. This is a dimensionless viscosity.\n\n2.  $\\pi$-group for $\\mu_\\infty$:\n    Since $\\mu_\\infty$ has the exact same dimensions as $\\mu$, the derivation is identical.\n    Let $\\Pi_4 = \\mu_\\infty \\cdot (\\mu_0)^{c_1} \\cdot (\\lambda)^{c_2}$. This yields $c_1 = -1$ and $c_2 = 0$.\n    Thus, $\\Pi_4 = \\frac{\\mu_\\infty}{\\mu_0}$.\n\n3.  $\\pi$-group for $\\dot{\\gamma}$:\n    Let $\\Pi_5 = \\dot{\\gamma} \\cdot (\\mu_0)^{c_1} \\cdot (\\lambda)^{c_2}$.\n    $$[M^0 L^0 T^0] = (T^{-1}) \\cdot (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^{c_1} \\cdot (T)^{c_2} = M^{c_1} L^{-c_1} T^{-1-c_1+c_2}$$\n    Equating exponents:\n    For $M$: $c_1 = 0$.\n    For $L$: $-c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$ (consistent).\n    For $T$: $-1 - c_1 + c_2 = 0 \\implies -1 - 0 + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = 1$.\n    Thus, $\\Pi_5 = \\dot{\\gamma} \\cdot (\\mu_0)^0 \\cdot (\\lambda)^1 = \\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe problem specifically asks to identify the shear-rate-based dimensionless group that \"captures the onset of shear-thinning as the imposed kinematic timescale becomes comparable to the material relaxation timescale.\"\nLet us analyze the physical meaning of our derived group $\\Pi_5 = \\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n- The material relaxation timescale is explicitly given as $\\lambda$. It represents the characteristic time for the fluid's internal structure (e.g., polymer chains) to return to equilibrium after a deformation.\n- The imposed kinematic timescale is the characteristic time of the flow-induced deformation. The shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ has units of inverse time ($T^{-1}$), so it represents the frequency of deformation. The timescale associated with the kinematics is therefore $t_{\\text{kinematic}} \\sim 1/\\dot{\\gamma}$.\nThe competition between these two timescales is captured by their ratio:\n$$\\frac{\\text{material relaxation timescale}}{\\text{imposed kinematic timescale}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{1/\\dot{\\gamma}} = \\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$$\nThis ratio, $\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$, is precisely the dimensionless group $\\Pi_5$ we derived. This group is known in rheology as the Weissenberg number, $Wi$. The onset of shear-thinning occurs when $Wi \\approx 1$, meaning the rate of deformation is comparable to the fluid's ability to relax.\n\nFinally, we explicitly validate this dimensionless group using the provided parameter units.\n- Unit of $\\lambda$: $\\mathrm{s}$\n- Unit of $\\dot{\\gamma}$: $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- Unit of the product $\\lambda\\dot{\\gamma}$: $(\\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{s}^{1-1} = \\mathrm{s}^0$.\nThe result has no units and is therefore dimensionless, confirming our analysis.\n\nThe required shear-rate-based dimensionless group is the product of the characteristic time and the shear rate.",

The coordinate $z$ is measured normal to the lower wall, with $z=0$ at the lower wall and $z=H$ at the upper wall.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two main tasks: first, to derive the velocity profile for a steady, fully developed, incompressible Newtonian flow between two parallel plates, and second, to use provided experimental data to estimate the wall shear rate.\n\nWe begin by deriving the velocity profile, $u(z)$. The flow is in the $x$-direction, confined between two plates at $z=0$ and $z=H$. The governing equation for momentum in the $x$-direction is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations. For a steady ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), incompressible Newtonian fluid, the momentum equation is:\n$$ \\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} $$\nGiven that the flow is unidirectional, the velocity vector is $\\mathbf{v} = u(z) \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$. This implies the velocity components in the $y$ and $z$ directions are zero. The convective acceleration term $(\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$ becomes zero. The assumption of fully developed flow implies that the velocity profile does not change in the streamwise direction, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$. Consequently, the pressure gradient in the streamwise direction, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}$, must be a constant. As the flow is only a function of $z$, the viscous term simplifies to $\\mu \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2}$. The $x$-momentum equation reduces to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dz^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThe pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is a constant driving the flow. Let's denote this constant as $C$. Integrating twice with respect to $z$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z + C_1 $$\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2 $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls:\n$1.$ At the lower wall, $z=0$, the velocity is zero: $u(0) = 0$.\n$2.$ At the upper wall, $z=H$, the velocity is zero: $u(H) = 0$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $u(0)=0$:\n$$ u(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition, $u(H)=0$:\n$$ u(H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} H^2 + C_1 H = 0 $$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$ C_1 = -\\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the equation for $u(z)$:\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z^2 - \\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} z = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (z^2 - Hz) $$\nFor flow to occur in the positive $x$-direction, the pressure must decrease, meaning $\\frac{dp}{dx}  0$. It is conventional to define a positive constant pressure gradient magnitude $G = -\\frac{dp}{dx}$. Substituting this into the expression gives the final form of the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u(z) = \\frac{G}{2\\mu} (Hz - z^2) $$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we estimate the wall shear rate at the lower wall, $\\dot{\\gamma}_w$.

From the expression for $\\dot{\\gamma}_w$, we can write $\\frac{G}{2\\mu} = \\frac{\\dot{\\gamma}_w}{H}$.

            "solution": "The derivation follows the Taylor-Aris method of homogenization.\n\n**1. Governing Equation and Averaging**\nThe advection-diffusion equation for solute concentration $c(r,z,t)$ in an axisymmetric tube is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + u(r,t) \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial z} = D_m \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial r} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial z^2} \\right) $$\nWe define the cross-sectional average concentration $\\bar{c}(z,t) = \\frac{2}{R^2} \\int_0^R r c(r,z,t) dr$. We decompose the velocity and concentration fields into mean and deviation parts: $u(r,t) = \\bar{u}(t) + u'(r,t)$ and $c(r,z,t) = \\bar{c}(z,t) + c'(r,z,t)$, where $\\langle u' \\rangle = \\langle c' \\rangle = 0$. Averaging the transport equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{c}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\langle (\\bar{u} + u')(\\bar{c} + c') \\rangle = D_m \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bar{c}}{\\partial z^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{c}}{\\partial t} + \\bar{u}(t) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{c}}{\\partial z} + \\frac{\\partial \\langle u'c' \\rangle}{\\partial z} = D_m \\frac{\\partial^2 \\bar{c}}{\\partial z^2} $$\nThe term $\\langle u'c' \\rangle$ is the axial dispersive flux.\n\n**2. Auxiliary Field and Quasi-Steady Approximation**\nIn the Taylor-Aris limit (long times, slow axial variation), radial diffusion equilibrates much faster than axial advection. The concentration deviation $c'$ is driven by the local mean axial gradient. We subtract the averaged equation from the full equation and neglect terms of higher order to get:\n$$ u'(r,t) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{c}}{\\partial z} \\approx D_m \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial r} \\right) $$\nThis suggests a linear relationship $c'(r,z,t) = \\chi(r,t) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{c}}{\\partial z}$. Substituting this gives a Poisson equation for the auxiliary field $\\chi(r,t)$:\n$$ D_m \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial r} \\right) = u'(r,t) = u(r,t) - \\bar{u}(t) $$\nwith boundary conditions $\\partial_r\\chi=0$ at $r=0$ and $r=R$, and the constraint $\\langle \\chi \\rangle = 0$.\n\n**3. Solving for the Auxiliary Field and Dispersion Coefficient**\nFirst, we relate the mean velocity $\\bar{u}(t)$ to the maximum velocity $U_{\\max}(t)$ for the profile $u(r,t) = U_{\\max}(t)[1 - (r/R)^m]$:\n$$ \\bar{u}(t) = \\langle u \\rangle = \\frac{2 U_{\\max}(t)}{R^2} \\int_0^R r \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^m\\right) dr = U_{\\max}(t) \\left(\\frac{m}{m+2}\\right) $$\nSo, $U_{\\max}(t) = \\bar{u}(t) \\frac{m+2}{m}$. The velocity deviation is $u'(r,t) = u(r,t) - \\bar{u}(t) = U_{\\max}(t) \\left[ \\frac{2}{m+2} - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^m \\right]$.\n\nWe integrate the Poisson equation for $\\chi$ twice with respect to $r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r D_m} \\int_0^r s \\cdot u'(s,t) ds = \\frac{U_{\\max}(t)}{D_m} \\left( \\frac{r}{m+2} - \\frac{r^{m+1}}{(m+2)R^m} \\right) $$\nThe total effective axial dispersion coefficient is $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = D_m + D_{shear}(t)$, where $D_{shear}(t) = -\\langle u'\\chi \\rangle$. Using integration by parts and the properties of $\\chi$, this can be shown to be $D_{shear}(t) = \\frac{2D_m}{R^2} \\int_0^R r (\\frac{\\partial\\chi}{\\partial r})^2 dr$. Substituting the expression for $\\partial_r\\chi$:\n$$ D_{shear}(t) = \\frac{2 D_m}{R^2} \\int_0^R r \\left[ \\frac{U_{\\max}(t)}{D_m(m+2)} \\left( \\frac{r}{m+2} - \\frac{r^{m+1}}{(m+2)R^m} \\right) \\right]^2 dr $$\nNo, there is an error in the previous step. Let's re-derive $\\partial_r \\chi$ carefully.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r D_m} \\int_0^r s \\cdot U_{\\max}(t) \\left[ \\frac{2}{m+2} - \\left(\\frac{s}{R}\\right)^m \\right] ds = \\frac{U_{\\max}(t)}{r D_m} \\left[ \\frac{2}{m+2}\\frac{r^2}{2} - \\frac{r^{m+2}}{(m+2)R^m} \\right] = \\frac{U_{\\max}(t)}{D_m(m+2)} \\left(r - \\frac{r^{m+1}}{R^m} \\right) $$\nThe expression is correct. Let's re-evaluate the integral for $D_{shear}$.\n$$ D_{shear}(t) = \\frac{2 D_m}{R^2} \\left(\\frac{U_{\\max}(t)}{D_m(m+2)}\\right)^2 \\int_0^R r \\left( r - \\frac{r^{m+1}}{R^m} \\right)^2 dr $$\n$$ = \\frac{2 U_{\\max}^2(t)}{D_m R^2 (m+2)^2} \\int_0^R \\left( r^3 - \\frac{2r^{m+3}}{R^m} + \\frac{r^{2m+3}}{R^{2m}} \\right) dr $$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{r^4}{4} - \\frac{2r^{m+4}}{(m+4)R^m} + \\frac{r^{2m+4}}{(2m+4)R^{2m}} \\right]_0^R = R^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{2}{m+4} + \\frac{1}{2(m+2)} \\right) = R^4 \\frac{m^2}{4(m+2)(m+4)} $$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$ D_{shear}(t) = \\frac{2 U_{\\max}^2(t)}{D_m R^2 (m+2)^2} \\left[ \\frac{R^4 m^2}{4(m+2)(m+4)} \\right] = \\frac{U_{\\max}^2(t) R^2}{D_m} \\frac{m^2}{2(m+2)^3(m+4)} $$\nNow we express this in terms of the mean velocity $\\bar{u}(t)$:\n$$ D_{shear}(t) = \\frac{(\\bar{u}(t) \\frac{m+2}{m})^2 R^2}{D_m} \\frac{m^2}{2(m+2)^3(m+4)} = \\frac{\\bar{u}^2(t) R^2}{D_m} \\frac{1}{2(m+2)(m+4)} $$\nThe instantaneous effective dispersion coefficient is:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = D_m + \\frac{\\bar{u}^2(t) R^2}{D_m} \\frac{1}{2(m+2)(m+4)} $$\n\n**4. Time-Averaging for Oscillatory Flow**\nFor a purely oscillatory, zero-mean flow, $\\bar{u}(t) = \\hat{u} \\cos(\\omega t)$. The reported effective dispersion coefficient is the time average over one period $T=2\\pi/\\omega$.\n$$ \\langle D_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\rangle_t = \\left\\langle D_m + D_{shear}(t) \\right\\rangle_t = D_m + \\frac{R^2}{D_m} \\frac{\\langle \\bar{u}^2(t) \\rangle_t}{2(m+2)(m+4)} $$\nThe time-average of the squared mean velocity is $\\langle \\bar{u}^2(t) \\rangle_t = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T (\\hat{u}\\cos(\\omega t))^2 dt = \\hat{u}^2 \\langle \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\rangle_t = \\hat{u}^2/2$.\nTherefore, for zero-mean oscillatory flow, the time-averaged effective dispersion coefficient is:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{eff, osc}} = D_m + \\frac{(\\hat{u}^2/2) R^2}{D_m} \\frac{1}{2(m+2)(m+4)} = D_m + \\frac{\\hat{u}^2 R^2}{D_m} \\frac{1}{4(m+2)(m+4)} $$\n\n**Final Formulas for Computation:**\n-   For steady flow with mean velocity $\\bar{u}$:\n    $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_m + \\frac{\\bar{u}^2 R^2}{D_m \\cdot 2(m+2)(m+4)}$\n-   For zero-mean oscillatory flow with velocity amplitude $\\hat{u}$:\n    $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_m + \\frac{\\hat{u}^2 R^2}{D_m \\cdot 4(m+2)(m+4)}$\n-   For zero flow ($\\bar{u}=0$ or $\\hat{u}=0$), the shear contribution is zero, so $D_{\\mathrm{eff}} = D_m$.\n-   The velocity profile exponent is $m = (n+1)/n$.\nThese formulas are implemented to compute the results for the test suite.",
