            "solution": "The problem requires a nondimensionalization of the governing equations for fluid flow to identify the ratio of inertial to viscous effects, an evaluation of this ratio for the given parameters, and a mechanistic argument regarding the possibility of turbulence.\n\nThe starting point is the incompressible Navier–Stokes equation for a fluid with constant density $\\rho$ and dynamic viscosity $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} \\right) = -\\nabla p + \\mu \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $t$ is time, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\nabla$ is the del operator. This is accompanied by the continuity equation for an incompressible fluid:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0\n$$\n\nTo nondimensionalize these equations, we introduce dimensionless variables, denoted with a superscript `*`. The problem specifies the characteristic length scale as the vessel diameter $D$ and the characteristic velocity scale as the speed $U$. We define the following dimensionless variables:\n-   Position vector: $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{D}$\n-   Velocity vector: $\\mathbf{v}^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}}{U}$\nThe characteristic time scale is derived from the length and velocity scales, representing the time for a fluid particle to travel the characteristic length: $t_{char} = \\frac{D}{U}$.\n-   Time: $t^* = \\frac{t}{D/U} = \\frac{tU}{D}$\nThe characteristic pressure scale is chosen from the dynamic pressure, $\\rho U^2$.\n-   Pressure: $p^* = \\frac{p}{\\rho U^2}$ (assuming a reference pressure of zero)\n\nNext, we express the derivatives in the Navier–Stokes equation in terms of these dimensionless variables:\n-   Time derivative: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial t^*}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^*} = \\frac{U}{D} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t^*}$\n-   Gradient operator: $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{D} \\nabla^*$, where $\\nabla^*$ is the gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{x}^*$.\n-   Laplacian operator: $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{1}{D^2} (\\nabla^*)^2$\n\nSubstituting these into the vector momentum equation:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{U}{D} \\frac{\\partial (U \\mathbf{v}^*)}{\\partial t^*} + (U \\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\frac{1}{D} \\nabla^*) (U \\mathbf{v}^*) \\right) = - \\frac{1}{D} \\nabla^* (\\rho U^2 p^*) + \\mu \\frac{1}{D^2} (\\nabla^*)^2 (U \\mathbf{v}^*)\n$$\nWe can factor out the constant scales from the derivatives:\n$$\n\\rho \\frac{U^2}{D} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* \\right) = - \\frac{\\rho U^2}{D} \\nabla^* p^* + \\frac{\\mu U}{D^2} (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe term $\\rho \\frac{U^2}{D} (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^*$ represents the inertial forces per unit volume. The term $\\frac{\\mu U}{D^2} (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*$ represents the viscous forces per unit volume.\n\nTo obtain the dimensionless form of the equation, we divide all terms by the coefficient of the inertial term, $\\frac{\\rho U^2}{D}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* = - \\nabla^* p^* + \\left( \\frac{\\mu U / D^2}{\\rho U^2 / D} \\right) (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe dimensionless group that appears as the coefficient of the viscous term is simplified as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu U / D^2}{\\rho U^2 / D} = \\frac{\\mu U}{D^2} \\frac{D}{\\rho U^2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\rho U D}\n$$\nThe dimensionless ratio of inertial to viscous effects is the inverse of this coefficient. If we consider the ratio of the characteristic inertial forces, which scale as $\\rho U^2 / D$, to the characteristic viscous forces, which scale as $\\mu U / D^2$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\text{Inertial forces}}{\\text{Viscous forces}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / D}{\\mu U / D^2} = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is the dimensionless ratio requested. This group is known as the Reynolds number, $Re$.\n\nNow we evaluate this ratio for the given vessel and properties.\nThe given values are:\n-   Density: $\\rho = 1060\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$\n-   Characteristic speed: $U = 1\\,\\mathrm{mm/s} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n-   Vessel diameter: $D = 7\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 7 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\cdot s} = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\cdot s)}$\n\nThe dimensionless ratio is calculated as:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho U D}{\\mu} = \\frac{(1060\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}) (1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (7 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\cdot s)}}\n$$\n$$\nRe = \\frac{1060 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (7 \\times 10^{-6})}{3.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{1060 \\times 7 \\times 10^{-6}}{3.5} = 1060 \\times 2 \\times 10^{-6} = 2120 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\n$$\nRe = 2.12 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $2.12 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n\nFinally, we construct a mechanistic argument for whether turbulence can arise. The dimensionless Navier-Stokes equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\underbrace{(\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^*}_{\\text{Inertial Term}} = - \\nabla^* p^* + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{Re} (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*}_{\\text{Viscous Term}}\n$$\nTurbulence is a flow regime characterized by chaotic, unsteady, and vortical motion. It is sustained by the nonlinear inertial term $(\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^*$, which can amplify small disturbances in the flow field. In contrast, the viscous term $\\frac{1}{Re} (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*$ acts to dissipate kinetic energy and damp out such disturbances. The onset of turbulence depends on the competition between these two effects.\n\nIn this problem, the calculated Reynolds number is $Re = 2.12 \\times 10^{-3}$. This value is extremely small ($Re \\ll 1$). Consequently, the coefficient of the viscous term, $\\frac{1}{Re}$, is very large:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Re} = \\frac{1}{2.12 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 472\n$$\nThe scaled equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{v}^*}{\\partial t^*} + (\\mathbf{v}^* \\cdot \\nabla^*) \\mathbf{v}^* \\approx - \\nabla^* p^* + 472 \\cdot (\\nabla^*)^2 \\mathbf{v}^*\n$$\nThe equation shows that the viscous term is several orders of magnitude larger than the inertial term (assuming all dimensionless derivatives are of order $1$). This indicates an overwhelming dominance of viscous forces over inertial forces.\n\nMechanistically, this means that any fledgling instability or disturbance that might appear in the flow would be immediately and powerfully suppressed by viscous damping. The inertial effects are far too weak to amplify the disturbance against this viscous opposition. The flow is \"stuck\" in a smooth, orderly, and predictable state. For turbulence to arise in a pipe, inertial forces must be significant enough to overcome viscous damping, which typically occurs at a critical Reynolds number of approximately $Re_{crit} \\approx 2300$. The calculated value of $Re = 0.00212$ is about six orders of magnitude below this threshold.\n\nTherefore, because of the profound dominance of viscous effects, the mechanism required for the self-sustenance of turbulence is absent. The flow in this microvessel is deep within the laminar regime, and turbulence cannot arise.",
