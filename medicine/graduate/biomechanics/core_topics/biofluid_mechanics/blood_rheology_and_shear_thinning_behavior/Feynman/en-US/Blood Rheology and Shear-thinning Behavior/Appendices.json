It is scientifically grounded in the principles of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics, specifically the rheology of blood. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided to construct a specific rheological model and compute the required values. The data and constraints are self-contained, consistent, and physically realistic.\n\nThe task is to first construct a minimal analytic expression for the apparent viscosity $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) $ that satisfies a set of specific criteria, and then to use this expression to calculate the viscosity at two different shear rates.\n\nWe begin by establishing a general form for a function that interpolates between a low-shear plateau $ \\mu_0 $ and a high-shear plateau $ \\mu_{\\infty} $. Such a function can be expressed as:\n$$ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = \\mu_{\\infty} + (\\mu_0 - \\mu_{\\infty}) f(\\dot{\\gamma}) $$\nHere, $ f(\\dot{\\gamma}) $ must be a dimensionless function that satisfies the boundary conditions $ f(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\to 1 $ as $ \\dot{\\gamma} \\to 0 $ and $ f(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\to 0 $ as $ \\dot{\\gamma} \\to \\infty $. This structure ensures that $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\to \\mu_0 $ as $ \\dot{\\gamma} \\to 0 $ and $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) \\to \\mu_{\\infty} $ as $ \\dot{\\gamma} \\to \\infty $.\n\nThe problem specifies that the transition is governed by a relaxation time $ \\lambda $ and a dimensionless sharpness parameter $ a $. This suggests that the argument of the function $ f $ should be the dimensionless shear rate, $ \\lambda \\dot{\\gamma} $. Therefore, we can write $ f(\\dot{\\gamma}) = f(\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma}) $.\n\nThe problem requires a specific asymptotic behavior for large shear rates ($ \\lambda \\dot{\\gamma} \\gg 1 $), namely $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) - \\mu_{\\infty} \\sim (\\mu_0 - \\mu_{\\infty}) (\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma})^{\\,n-1} $. Substituting our general form for $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) $, we get:\n$$ (\\mu_0 - \\mu_{\\infty}) f(\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma}) \\sim (\\mu_0 - \\mu_{\\infty}) (\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma})^{\\,n-1} $$\nThis implies that for $ \\lambda \\dot{\\gamma} \\gg 1 $, the function $ f $ must have the asymptotic form $ f(\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma}) \\sim (\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma})^{\\,n-1} $.\n\nLet us now construct a minimal analytic function $ f(x) $, where $ x = \\lambda \\dot{\\gamma} $, that satisfies all these conditions:\n1. $ f(0) = 1 $\n2. For large $ x $, $ f(x) \\sim x^{n-1} $ (which also ensures $ f(x) \\to 0 $ as $ x \\to \\infty $, since $ 0 < n < 1 $ implies $ n-1 < 0 $)\n3. The function should incorporate the parameter $ a $.\n\nA common and minimal functional form that meets these requirements is the generalized power-law form used in models like the Carreau-Yasuda model. Let's propose the following structure for $ f(x) $:\n$$ f(x) = [1 + x^a]^k $$\nfor some exponent $ k $. Let's verify the conditions.\nThe condition $ f(0) = 1 $ is immediately satisfied: $ f(0) = [1 + 0^a]^k = 1^k = 1 $ for any finite $ k $.\n\nFor the large $ x $ behavior, we have:\n$$ f(x) = [1 + x^a]^k \\approx [x^a]^k = x^{ak} \\quad \\text{for } x \\gg 1 $$\nWe must match this to the required asymptotic form $ x^{n-1} $. Equating the exponents gives:\n$$ ak = n-1 \\implies k = \\frac{n-1}{a} $$\nThe parameter $ a $ controls the sharpness of the transition from the plateau to the power-law region.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $ k $ back into our function $ f(x) $, we obtain:\n$$ f(\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma}) = [1 + (\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma})^a]^{\\frac{n-1}{a}} $$\nPlugging this into our original expression for $ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) $ yields the final model:\n$$ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = \\mu_{\\infty} + (\\mu_0 - \\mu_{\\infty}) \\left[1 + (\\lambda \\dot{\\gamma})^a\\right]^{\\frac{n-1}{a}} $$\nThis is the Carreau-Yasuda model, which is a minimal and well-established model that satisfies all the problem's constraints.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical calculation using the given parameter values:\n$ \\mu_0 = 0.016\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s} $\n$ \\mu_{\\infty} = 0.0035\\,\\text{Pa}\\cdot\\text{s} $\n$ \\lambda = 1\\ \\text{s} $\n$ a = 2 $\n$ n = 0.25 $\n\nThe specific expression for the apparent viscosity is:\n$$ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = 0.0035 + (0.016 - 0.0035) \\left[1 + (1 \\cdot \\dot{\\gamma})^2\\right]^{\\frac{0.25-1}{2}} $$\n$$ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = 0.0035 + 0.0125 \\left[1 + \\dot{\\gamma}^2\\right]^{\\frac{-0.75}{2}} $$\n$$ \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}) = 0.0035 + 0.0125 \\left[1 + \\dot{\\gamma}^2\\right]^{-0.375} $$\n\nWe need to compute the viscosity at two shear rates.\n\n1.

The corresponding test space for velocity, $W$, is chosen such that test functions vanish on $\\Gamma_D$, i.e., $W = [H^1_0(\\Omega)]^d$.\n\nWe multiply the momentum equation by a velocity test function $\\mathbf{w} \\in W$ and the continuity equation by a pressure test function $q \\in Q = P = L^2(\\Omega)$, and integrate over the domain $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left( -\\nabla\\cdot\\left(2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})\\,D(\\mathbf{v})\\right) + \\nabla p \\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\, d\\Omega = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} q\\,(\\nabla\\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nApplying integration by parts (Green's first identity for tensors) to the viscous term in the first equation yields:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} \\left(2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})\\,D(\\mathbf{v})\\right) : \\nabla\\mathbf{w} \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} \\left(2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})\\,D(\\mathbf{v})\\,\\mathbf{n}\\right) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\, dS\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. Since $\\mathbf{w} \\in W = [H^1_0(\\Omega)]^d$, $\\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{0}$ on $\\Gamma_D$. On the remaining part of the boundary, $\\Gamma_N = \\partial\\Omega \\setminus \\Gamma_D$, natural boundary conditions (tractions) may be applied. If $\\Gamma_N$ is traction-free or has a prescribed traction $\\mathbf{t}_N$, the boundary integral can be handled accordingly. For simplicity, assuming the entire boundary has Dirichlet conditions, the boundary integral vanishes.\n\nUsing the symmetry of the viscous stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^\\top$, and the fact that $D(\\mathbf{w})$ is the symmetric part of $\\nabla\\mathbf{w}$, we have $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}:\\nabla\\mathbf{w} = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}:D(\\mathbf{w})$. Thus, the viscous term simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})\\,D(\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega\n$$\nApplying integration by parts to the pressure term gives:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} (\\nabla p) \\cdot \\mathbf{w} \\, d\\Omega = - \\int_{\\Omega} p (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\partial\\Omega} p (\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\, dS\n$$\nThe boundary integral again vanishes because $\\mathbf{w}=\\mathbf{0}$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nCombining these results, the weak formulation is: Find $(\\mathbf{v}, p) \\in V \\times P$ such that for all $(\\mathbf{w}, q) \\in W \\times Q$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v}))\\,D(\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega} p (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega = L(\\mathbf{w})\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{\\Omega} q (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega = 0\n$$\nwhere $L(\\mathbf{w})$ is a linear functional representing body forces and natural boundary conditions, which are zero in this problem's setup. The problem is nonlinear because the viscosity $\\mu$ is a function of the solution $\\mathbf{v}$ through $\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v})$.\n\nWe can define a nonlinear residual $R((\\mathbf{v}, p); (\\mathbf{w}, q))$:\n$$\nR((\\mathbf{v}, p); (\\mathbf{w}, q)) = \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v}))\\,D(\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega} p (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} q (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}) \\, d\\Omega - L(\\mathbf{w}, q)\n$$\nThe problem is to find $(\\mathbf{v}, p)$ such that $R((\\mathbf{v}, p); (\\mathbf{w}, q))=0$ for all valid test functions. This nonlinearity requires an iterative solution strategy.\n\n**Nonlinear Iteration Strategies:**\n\n1.  **Picard Iteration (Fixed-Point Method):** This is the simplest approach. Given a solution $(\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}, p^{(k)})$ from iteration $k$, we compute the viscosity field $\\mu^{(k)} = \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}))$. We then solve for the next iterate $(\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}, p^{(k+1)})$ by treating $\\mu^{(k)}$ as a known spatial function. This results in a *linear* problem at each step: Find $(\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}, p^{(k+1)})$ such that for all $(\\mathbf{w}, q)$:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu^{(k)}\\,D(\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega - \\int_{\\Omega} p^{(k+1)} (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega = L(\\mathbf{w})\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega} q (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}) \\, d\\Omega = 0\n    $$\n    The iteration proceeds until a convergence criterion, such as $\\|\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)} - \\mathbf{v}^{(k)}\\|/\\|\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}\\| < \\text{tol}$, is met. While simple to implement, Picard iteration may converge slowly, especially for strongly nonlinear problems.\n\n2.  **Newton's Method:** This method typically offers quadratic convergence near the solution but requires computing the Jacobian (the Gateaux derivative) of the residual $R$. We seek an update $(\\delta\\mathbf{v}, \\delta p)$ by linearizing the residual around the current iterate $(\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}, p^{(k)})$:\n    $$\n    J(\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}, p^{(k)}) ((\\delta\\mathbf{v}, \\delta p); (\\mathbf{w}, q)) = -R((\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}, p^{(k)}); (\\mathbf{w}, q))\n    $$\n    The Jacobian $J$ is the derivative of $R$ with respect to the solution variables $(\\mathbf{v}, p)$ in the direction $(\\delta\\mathbf{v}, \\delta p)$. The terms in $R$ are linear in $(\\mathbf{v}, p)$ except for the viscous term. The derivative of the viscous term is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon}\\left[ \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v}+\\epsilon\\delta\\mathbf{v}))\\,D(\\mathbf{v}+\\epsilon\\delta\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega \\right]_{\\epsilon=0}\n    $$\n    Using the product rule and chain rule, this becomes:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v}))\\,D(\\delta\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega + \\int_{\\Omega} 2\\,\\mu'(\\dot{\\gamma}(\\mathbf{v})) \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\gamma}}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{v}\\right) D(\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) \\, d\\Omega\n    $$\n    where $\\mu' = d\\mu/d\\dot{\\gamma}$. The directional derivative of the shear rate is $\\frac{\\partial \\dot{\\gamma}}{\\partial \\mathbf{v}} \\cdot \\delta\\mathbf{v} = \\frac{2 D(\\mathbf{v}):D(\\delta\\mathbf{v})}{\\dot{\\gamma}}$ for $\\dot{\\gamma} \\neq 0$. This gives the full Jacobian contribution from the viscous term:\n    $$\n    \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( 2\\,\\mu(\\dot{\\gamma})\\,D(\\delta\\mathbf{v}) : D(\\mathbf{w}) + \\frac{4\\,\\mu'(\\dot{\\gamma})}{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\left(D(\\mathbf{v}):D(\\delta\\mathbf{v})\\right) \\left(D(\\mathbf{v}):D(\\mathbf{w})\\right) \\right) d\\Omega\n    $$\n    At each Newton step, one assembles and solves the linear system for $(\\delta\\mathbf{v}, \\delta p)$ defined by the Jacobian and the negative residual, then updates $(\\mathbf{v}^{(k+1)}, p^{(k+1)}) = (\\mathbf{v}^{(k)}+\\delta\\mathbf{v}, p^{(k)}+\\delta p)$.\n\n### Part 2: Computational Implementation for Pipe Flow\n\nFor the one-dimensional axisymmetric problem, the velocity field is $\\mathbf{v} = u(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_z$. The only non-zero component of the rate-of-deformation tensor $D$ is $D_{rz} = D_{zr} = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dr}$. The shear rate simplifies to $\\dot{\\gamma} = \\sqrt{2(D_{rz}^2 + D_{zr}^2)} = \\sqrt{4(\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{du}{dr})^2} = |\\frac{du}{dr}|$. The weak form provided is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{R} r\\,\\mu\\left(\\left|\\frac{du}{dr}\\right|\\right)\\,\\frac{du}{dr}\\,\\frac{dw}{dr}\\,dr = \\int_{0}^{R} r\\,G\\,w\\,dr\n$$\nThis must hold for all suitable test functions $w$ with $w(R)=0$.\n\nA Galerkin Finite Element method using continuous, piecewise-linear basis functions (hat functions $\\phi_j$) is employed. The radial domain $[0, R]$ is discretized into a uniform mesh $0=r_0, r_1, \\dots, r_N=R$. The velocity $u(r)$ is approximated by $u_h(r) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N} U_j \\phi_j(r)$, where $U_j = u_h(r_j)$ are the nodal velocity values. The no-slip condition imposes $U_N=0$. The test functions are chosen from the same basis, $w(r) = \\phi_i(r)$ for $i=0, \\dots, N-1$.\n\nSubstituting into the weak form leads to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations $K(\\mathbf{U})\\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{U} = [U_0, \\dots, U_{N-1}]^T$. We solve this system using the Picard iteration described in Part 1.\n\n**Iterative Scheme:**\n1.  **Initialization ($k=0$):** Start with an initial guess for the velocity profile, for instance, the analytical solution for a Newtonian fluid with viscosity $\\mu_0$: $U_j^{(0)} = \\frac{G}{4\\mu_0}(R^2 - r_j^2)$ for $j=0, \\dots, N-1$. Set $U_N^{(0)}=0$.\n2.  **Iteration ($k \\ge 0$):**\n    a.  **Compute Viscosity:** For each element $e$ between nodes $r_e$ and $r_{e+1}$, the velocity gradient is constant: $\\frac{du_h^{(k)}}{dr} = \\frac{U_{e+1}^{(k)} - U_e^{(k)}}{h}$, where $h$ is the element size. The shear rate on the element is $\\dot{\\gamma}_e^{(k)} = \\left|\\frac{U_{e+1}^{(k)} - U_e^{(k)}}{h}\\right|$. The element-wise viscosity is then $\\mu_e^{(k)} = \\mu(\\dot{\\gamma}_e^{(k)})$ using the Carreau-Yasuda model.\n    b.  **Assemble Linear System:** Construct the stiffness matrix $K^{(k)}$ and force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ for the unknown velocities $\\mathbf{U}^{(k+1)} = [U_0^{(k+1)}, \\dots, U_{N-1}^{(k+1)}]^T$. The entries are formed by summing contributions from each element:\n        $$\n        K_{ij}^{(k)} = \\sum_{e} \\int_{r_e}^{r_{e+1}} r \\mu_e^{(k)} \\frac{d\\phi_j}{dr} \\frac{d\\phi_i}{dr} dr, \\quad F_i = \\sum_{e} \\int_{r_e}^{r_{e+1}} r G \\phi_i dr\n        $$\n    c.  **Solve:** Solve the linear system $K^{(k)}\\mathbf{U}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{F}$.\n    d.  **Check Convergence:** Compare the new solution $\\mathbf{U}^{(k+1)}$ with the old one $\\mathbf{U}^{(k)}$. If $\\frac{\\|\\mathbf{U}^{(k+1)} - \\mathbf{U}^{(k)}\\|_2}{\\|\\mathbf{U}^{(k+1)}\\|_2} < \\text{tol}$, the process has converged. Otherwise, set $k \\leftarrow k+1$ and return to step 2a.\n\n**Calculation of Output Quantities:**\n\n-   **Wall Shear Stress ($\\tau_w$):** For fully developed axisymmetric pipe flow, a force balance on a fluid cylinder of radius $R$ and length $L$ gives $(p(z) - p(z+L))\\pi R^2 = \\tau_w 2\\pi R L$. Since $-\\frac{dp}{dz} = \\frac{p(z)-p(z+L)}{L} = G$, this simplifies to $\\tau_w = \\frac{RG}{2}$. This value depends only on the given geometry and pressure gradient, not on the fluid properties or the resulting flow field.\n\n-   **Volumetric Flow Rate ($Q$):** The flow rate is computed by integrating the numerically obtained velocity profile:\n    $$\n    Q = 2\\pi \\int_0^R u_h(r) r dr = 2\\pi \\sum_{e=0}^{N-1} \\int_{r_e}^{r_{e+1}} (U_e \\phi_e(r) + U_{e+1} \\phi_{e+1}(r)) r dr\n    $$\n    The integral over one element $e=[r_e, r_{e+1}]$ can be computed analytically:\n    $$\n    Q_e = 2\\pi \\left( U_e \\int_{r_e}^{r_{e+1}} r \\phi_e(r) dr + U_{e+1} \\int_{r_e}^{r_{e+1}} r \\phi_{e+1}(r) dr \\right) = 2\\pi \\frac{h}{6} \\left( U_e(2r_e+r_{e+1}) + U_{e+1}(r_e+2r_{e+1}) \\right)\n    $$\n    The total flow rate $Q$ is the sum of these elemental contributions, $Q = \\sum_e Q_e$.\n\nThe provided Python code implements this FE-based Picard iterative solver.",
