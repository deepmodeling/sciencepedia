The BOS polygon vertices are given in counterclockwise order by\n$$\n(x_1,y_1)=(-0.12,\\,0.10),\\quad (x_2,y_2)=(0.12,\\,0.10),\\quad (x_3,y_3)=(0.16,\\,-0.05),\n$$\n$$\n(x_4,y_4)=(0.10,\\,-0.20),\\quad (x_5,y_5)=(-0.10,\\,-0.20),\\quad (x_6,y_6)=(-0.16,\\,-0.05).\n$$\nThe vertical projection of the whole-body Center of Mass (COM) onto the ground plane is at $(x_c,y_c)=(0.03,\\,-0.04)$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The coordinate system is defined with the lateral axis as the $x$-axis and the anterior-posterior axis as the $y$-axis.\n- The Base of Support (BOS) is a convex polygon with vertices given in meters:\n  $P_1 = (x_1, y_1) = (-0.12, 0.10)$\n  $P_2 = (x_2, y_2) = (0.12, 0.10)$\n  $P_3 = (x_3, y_3) = (0.16, -0.05)$\n  $P_4 = (x_4, y_4) = (0.10, -0.20)$\n  $P_5 = (x_5, y_5) = (-0.10, -0.20)$\n  $P_6 = (x_6, y_6) = (-0.16, -0.05)$\n- The vertical projection of the whole-body Center of Mass (COM) is at $(x_c, y_c) = (0.03, -0.04)$.\n- The condition for static equilibrium is that the COM projection must lie within the BOS.\n- The task is to find the minimum lateral COM shift, defined as the smallest non-negative value of $|x-x_c|$ such that the point $(x, y_c)$ lies on the BOS polygon boundary.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of static equilibrium and biomechanics, where the relationship between the COM projection and the BOS determines postural stability. The provided data are realistic for human quiet standing. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary geometric information (polygon vertices, a point, a specified line of motion) to determine a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\n**Step 3: Proceed to Solution**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the boundaries of the BOS at the specific anterior-posterior level of the COM projection. The COM is to be shifted purely laterally, which means its projection moves along the horizontal line defined by $y = y_c = -0.04$. To find the minimum shift to reach the boundary, we must find the intersection points of this line with the edges of the BOS polygon.\n\nThe boundary of the BOS is a polygon defined by six vertices. An edge of the polygon connecting vertices $(x_i, y_i)$ and $(x_j, y_j)$ can intersect the line $y = y_c$ only if $y_c$ lies between $y_i$ and $y_j$, i.e., $\\min(y_i, y_j) \\le y_c \\le \\max(y_i, y_j)$. We examine the $y$-coordinates of the vertices: $y_1=0.10$, $y_2=0.10$, $y_3=-0.05$, $y_4=-0.20$, $y_5=-0.20$, $y_6=-0.05$. The value $y_c = -0.04$ lies in the following intervals:\n- Between $y_2=0.10$ and $y_3=-0.05$. Thus, the line $y=-0.04$ intersects the edge $P_2P_3$.\n- Between $y_1=0.10$ and $y_6=-0.05$. Thus, the line $y=-0.04$ intersects the edge $P_6P_1$.\n\nWe now compute the $x$-coordinates of these two intersection points. The equation for a line segment between $(x_a, y_a)$ and $(x_b, y_b)$ can be rearranged to solve for $x$ given a value of $y$:\n$$x = x_a + (y - y_a) \\frac{x_b - x_a}{y_b - y_a}$$\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection with the right-side boundary edge, $P_2P_3$. Let this intersection point have an $x$-coordinate of $x_R$. Using the formula with $(x_a, y_a) = P_2 = (0.12, 0.10)$ and $(x_b, y_b) = P_3 = (0.16, -0.05)$, and with $y=y_c=-0.04$:\n$$x_R = 0.12 + (-0.04 - 0.10) \\frac{0.16 - 0.12}{-0.05 - 0.10}$$\n$$x_R = 0.12 + (-0.14) \\frac{0.04}{-0.15}$$\n$$x_R = 0.12 + \\frac{0.0056}{0.15} = 0.12 + \\frac{56}{1500} = \\frac{12}{100} + \\frac{56}{1500} = \\frac{180}{1500} + \\frac{56}{1500} = \\frac{236}{1500} = \\frac{59}{375}$$\nThe $x$-coordinate of the right boundary at this level is $x_R = \\frac{59}{375}$ meters.\n\nNext, we find the intersection with the left-side boundary edge, $P_6P_1$. Let this intersection point have an $x$-coordinate of $x_L$. Using $(x_a, y_a) = P_6 = (-0.16, -0.05)$ and $(x_b, y_b) = P_1 = (-0.12, 0.10)$:\n$$x_L = -0.16 + (-0.04 - (-0.05)) \\frac{-0.12 - (-0.16)}{0.10 - (-0.05)}$$\n$$x_L = -0.16 + (0.01) \\frac{0.04}{0.15}$$\n$$x_L = -0.16 + \\frac{0.0004}{0.15} = -0.16 + \\frac{4}{1500} = -\\frac{16}{100} + \\frac{4}{1500} = -\\frac{240}{1500} + \\frac{4}{1500} = -\\frac{236}{1500} = -\\frac{59}{375}$$\nThe $x$-coordinate of the left boundary is $x_L = -\\frac{59}{375}$ meters. (Note: The symmetry of the BOS polygon, where $P_1$ is symmetric to $P_2$, $P_6$ to $P_3$, etc., with respect to the $y$-axis, implies that $x_L = -x_R$, which our calculation confirms.)\n\nThe initial lateral position of the COM projection is $x_c = 0.03$. The problem asks for the minimum shift required to reach the boundary. This means finding the smaller of the two possible displacement magnitudes: one to the right boundary and one to the left boundary.\nThe shift required to reach the right boundary is the distance $|x_R - x_c|$:\n$$\\left| \\frac{59}{375} - 0.03 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{59}{375} - \\frac{3}{100} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{236}{1500} - \\frac{45}{1500} \\right| = \\frac{191}{1500}$$\nThe shift required to reach the left boundary is the distance $|x_L - x_c|$:\n$$\\left| -\\frac{59}{375} - 0.03 \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{236}{1500} - \\frac{45}{1500} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{281}{1500} \\right| = \\frac{281}{1500}$$\n\nWe compare these two possible shifts:\nShift to the right: $\\frac{191}{1500} \\approx 0.127333...$ meters.\nShift to the left: $\\frac{281}{1500} \\approx 0.187333...$ meters.\n\nThe minimum of these two values is $\\frac{191}{1500}$ meters.\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives $0.1273$ meters.\n\nThe interpretation of this result pertains to the concept of the margin of stability. This margin is the maximum distance the COM can be displaced in a given direction before it exits the BOS, leading to a loss of balance. In this case, the subject's COM projection is at $(0.03, -0.04)$, which is offset to the right from the BOS centerline (the $y$-axis). Consequently, the margin of stability for a rightward (positive $x$) sway is smaller ($0.1273$ m) than for a leftward (negative $x$) sway ($0.1873$ m). The computed value of $0.1273$ m represents the subject's lateral balance margin in the direction of their initial COM displacement. A smaller margin indicates a greater susceptibility to losing balance from a perturbation in that direction.",

            "solution": "The user has requested a solution to a biomechanics problem. I will first validate the problem statement and then, if it is valid, provide a complete solution.\n\n## Problem Validation\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information:\n- **Model**: The body is a single-link inverted pendulum pivoting at the ankle.\n- **Masses**:\n    - The lower trunk and legs have mass $m$.\n    - The arm–hand system has an effective point mass $m_{u}$.\n    - An external load has mass $L$.\n- **Geometry**:\n    - The mass $m_{u}$ is at a fixed vertical height $z_{u}$ above the ankle.\n    - The combined mass $(m_{u}+L)$ is also located at height $z_{u}$.\n- **Dynamics**:\n    - At the onset of the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), the arm–hand–load system's center of mass undergoes a prescribed forward horizontal acceleration $a_0$.\n    - The APA is a backward shift of the center-of-pressure (COP) by a distance $s$ relative to quiet stance.\n    - At APA onset, the net whole-body angular acceleration about the ankle is zero.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    - Small sway angles.\n    - Negligible vertical accelerations.\n    - Ground reaction force magnitude equals total weight $W=(m+m_{u}+L)g$.\n    - Pre-existing gravitational torques from quiet stance are balanced and do not contribute to the incremental APA dynamics.\n- **Objective**:\n    - Let $s(0)$ be the APA amplitude for $L=0$.\n    - Let $s(L)$ be the APA amplitude for a load $L$.\n    - Compute the dimensionless scaling factor $k(L)=\\frac{s(L)}{s(0)}$ as a closed-form expression in terms of $m$, $m_{u}$, $z_{u}$, $a_{0}$, $g$, and $L$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of biomechanics and classical mechanics, specifically using the inverted pendulum model for postural control and the concept of anticipatory postural adjustments. The use of Newton's laws (or D'Alembert's principle in the form of inverse dynamics) is standard.\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient variables and a clear condition (zero net angular acceleration) to establish a solvable equation.\nThe language is objective and precise.\n\nThere is a point of potential ambiguity: \"zero net whole-body angular acceleration\". If the body were a single rigid link, a zero angular acceleration would imply zero linear acceleration for all points, contradicting the given that the arm accelerates with $a_0$. However, the problem distinguishes two mass components, $m$ and $(m_{u}+L)$, with the latter having a prescribed acceleration. This implies a multi-body system. In this context, \"zero net whole-body angular acceleration\" is best interpreted as the goal of the APA: to generate a postural torque that exactly counteracts the disturbance torque from the arm movement, such that the primary postural link (the trunk and legs, mass $m$) experiences no angular acceleration. This interpretation is physically meaningful, consistent with the purpose of an APA, and renders the problem solvable. It is a common simplification in this domain of study.\n\nBased on this analysis, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed to the solution.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe solution is derived using the principle of inverse dynamics, as suggested by the problem statement. We will sum the moments about the ankle joint, which acts as the pivot of the inverted pendulum. The rotational equation of motion for a system of particles about a fixed point (the ankle, denoted by A) is $\\sum \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext,A}} = \\frac{d\\vec{H}_{\\text{A}}}{dt}$, where $\\sum \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{ext,A}}$ is the sum of external torques and $\\frac{d\\vec{H}_{\\text{A}}}{dt}$ is the rate of change of the system's angular momentum about A.\n\nLet's establish a coordinate system where the ankle is at the origin $(0, 0)$, the x-axis is horizontal (forward), and the y-axis is vertical (upward). All moments will be calculated about the z-axis (out of the sagittal plane).\n\nThe rate of change of angular momentum is given by $\\frac{d\\vec{H}_{\\text{A}}}{dt} = \\sum_i \\vec{r}_i \\times (m_i \\vec{a}_i)$, where the sum is over the particles of the system. We have two lumped masses to consider:\n1. The trunk and legs, with mass $m$.\n2. The arm-hand-load system, with mass $(m_u+L)$.\n\nThe problem states to enforce \"zero net whole-body angular acceleration at APA onset\". As validated, we interpret this to mean the angular acceleration of the main postural link (mass $m$) is zero. Since the system starts from rest, this implies the linear acceleration of mass $m$ is also zero, $\\vec{a}_m = 0$.\n\nThe arm-hand-load system is at a vertical height $z_u$, so its position vector at the onset of movement (when the body is still upright) is $\\vec{r}_{u+L} = (0, z_u)$. It is given a horizontal acceleration $\\vec{a}_{u+L} = (a_0, 0)$. The contribution of this mass to the rate of change of angular momentum is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{d\\vec{H}_{\\text{A}}}{dt} \\right)_{u+L} = \\vec{r}_{u+L} \\times ((m_u+L)\\vec{a}_{u+L}) = (0, z_u, 0) \\times ((m_u+L)a_0, 0, 0) $$\nThe resulting vector is purely in the z-direction:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{d\\vec{H}_{\\text{A}}}{dt} \\right)_{z} = -z_u (m_u+L) a_0 $$\nSince $\\vec{a}_m=0$, the total rate of change of angular momentum of the system is given by this term alone.\n\nNow, we evaluate the sum of external torques about the ankle. The external forces are gravity and the ground reaction force (GRF).\n- The total weight is $W = (m+m_u+L)g$. The assumption that pre-existing gravitational torques are balanced implies that in quiet stance, the total center of mass (COM) projects vertically onto the quiet-stance center of pressure (COP). The APA involves an *additional* backward shift of the COP by a distance $s$. We analyze the incremental torques generated by the APA.\n- The vertical component of the GRF has magnitude $F_y = W$, as vertical accelerations are negligible. This force acts at the COP. The APA shifts the COP backward by $s$, so its new position relative to the quiet stance COP is $x_{\\text{COP}} = -s$. Assuming the ankle is the reference for the coordinate system and coincides with the quiet-stance COP for simplicity (a common convention that doesn't affect the incremental analysis), the torque from the vertical GRF is:\n$$ \\vec{\\tau}_{\\text{GRF}} = \\vec{r}_{\\text{COP}} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}} = (-s, 0, 0) \\times (F_x, W, 0) $$\nwhere $F_x$ is the horizontal GRF. The torque from the vertical component is:\n$$ \\tau_z = -sW = -s(m+m_u+L)g $$\nThe torque from the horizontal GRF $F_x$ about the ankle is zero since its lever arm is zero.\n- The incremental gravitational torque is zero at the onset of movement because the COM has not yet displaced horizontally.\n\nEquating the net external torque with the rate of change of angular momentum:\n$$ \\sum \\tau_{\\text{ext,A},z} = \\frac{dH_{\\text{A},z}}{dt} $$\n$$ -s(m+m_u+L)g = -z_u(m_u+L)a_0 $$\nSolving for the APA amplitude $s$ as a function of the load $L$, which we denote $s(L)$:\n$$ s(L) = \\frac{z_u a_0 (m_u+L)}{g(m+m_u+L)} $$\nThis expression gives the required backward COP shift to counteract the forward-tipping moment generated by the arm acceleration, thereby keeping the trunk stationary.\n\nTo find the scaling factor $k(L)$, we first need the APA amplitude for the no-load case, $s(0)$. We obtain this by setting $L=0$ in the expression for $s(L)$:\n$$ s(0) = \\frac{z_u a_0 (m_u+0)}{g(m+m_u+0)} = \\frac{z_u a_0 m_u}{g(m+m_u)} $$\nThe dimensionless scaling factor $k(L)$ is the ratio $\\frac{s(L)}{s(0)}$:\n$$ k(L) = \\frac{s(L)}{s(0)} = \\frac{\\frac{z_u a_0 (m_u+L)}{g(m+m_u+L)}}{\\frac{z_u a_0 m_u}{g(m+m_u)}} $$\nThe terms $\\frac{z_u a_0}{g}$ cancel out:\n$$ k(L) = \\frac{m_u+L}{m+m_u+L} \\cdot \\frac{m+m_u}{m_u} $$\nThis can be written as a single fraction:\n$$ k(L) = \\frac{(m+m_u)(m_u+L)}{m_u(m+m_u+L)} $$\nThis is the final, exact, closed-form analytic expression for the scaling factor.",

The function $m(t)$ is defined as:\n$$m(t) = \\min\\left(x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2}, L - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t)\\right)$$\nWe substitute the given expression for the COP trajectory, $x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) = \\frac{L}{2} + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)$, into the two arguments of the $\\min$ function.\n\nLet the first argument be $g_1(t)$ and the second be $g_2(t)$.\n$$g_1(t) = x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} = \\left(\\frac{L}{2} + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} = \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)$$\n$$g_2(t) = L - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - x_{\\mathrm{COP}}(t) = L - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - \\left(\\frac{L}{2} + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)$$\n\nSo, the margin function is:\n$$m(t) = \\min\\left(\\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right), \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right)$$\nLet $C = \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2}$ and $S(t) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)$. The expression becomes $m(t) = \\min(C + S(t), C - S(t))$.\nThe minimum of two numbers $C+S$ and $C-S$ is $C - |S|$.\nTherefore, the margin function can be written in a more compact form:\n$$m(t) = \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - \\left|A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right|$$\n\nOur goal is to find the minimum value of $m(t)$ for $t \\in [0, T]$.\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\min_{t\\in[0,T]} \\left( \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - \\left|A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right| \\right)$$\nThe terms $\\frac{L}{2}$ and $\\frac{w_{\\min}}{2}$ are constants. To minimize the expression, we must maximize the term being subtracted, which is $\\left|A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right|$.\nThe sine function, $\\sin(\\theta)$, ranges from $-1$ to $1$. The absolute value, $|\\sin(\\theta)|$, ranges from $0$ to $1$.\nGiven that the amplitude $A$ is a positive constant ($A=0.06\\,\\text{m}$), the maximum value of the term $\\left|A \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right|$ is $|A| \\times \\max\\left|\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right| = A \\times 1 = A$.\nThis maximum is achieved when $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) = 1$ or $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) = -1$. Over the interval $t \\in [0,T]$, this occurs at times such as $t=T/4$ and $t=3T/4$.\n\nSubstituting this maximum value into the expression for $m(t)$ gives the minimum value, $m_{\\mathrm{min}}$:\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{L}{2} - \\frac{w_{\\min}}{2} - A$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $L = 0.24\\,\\text{m}$\n- $w_{\\min} = 0.08\\,\\text{m}$\n- $A = 0.06\\,\\text{m}$\n\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = \\frac{0.24\\,\\text{m}}{2} - \\frac{0.08\\,\\text{m}}{2} - 0.06\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.12\\,\\text{m} - 0.04\\,\\text{m} - 0.06\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.08\\,\\text{m} - 0.06\\,\\text{m}$$\n$$m_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.02\\,\\text{m}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result is $0.02\\,\\text{m}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.02000\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nThe assessment of realizability is based on the sign of $m_{\\mathrm{min}}$. Since $m_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.02 > 0$, the condition $m(t) \\ge 0$ is satisfied for all $t$ in the interval $[0, T]$. This means that at all times, the required minimal support width can be maintained within the boundaries of the base of support. Therefore, the postural sway described is physically realizable under the given model and constraints. The minimum clearance between the edge of the minimal required support area and the boundary of the BOS is $0.02\\,\\text{m}$.",
