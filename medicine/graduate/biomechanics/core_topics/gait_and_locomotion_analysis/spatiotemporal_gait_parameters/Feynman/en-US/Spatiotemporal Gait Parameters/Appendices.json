            "problem": "A subject walks steadily on a level surface at constant forward speed $v$ and exhibits a fixed cadence $C$, where $v = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $C = 120\\,\\text{steps}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Let $x(t)$ denote the forward position of the subject’s center of mass, and let $\\{t_n\\}$ denote the times of successive foot contacts, with one contact per step. Define the step length $L_{\\mathrm{step}}$ as the forward distance advanced per step, $L_{\\mathrm{step}} = x(t_{n+1}) - x(t_n)$, and the stride length $L_{\\mathrm{stride}}$ as the forward distance advanced over one full gait cycle comprising two consecutive steps.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid, as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of kinematics and biomechanics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested. First, we derive the relationships between walking speed $v$, cadence $C$, step length $L_{\\mathrm{step}}$, and stride length $L_{\\mathrm{stride}}$, and then compute the numerical values for the latter two. Second, we analyze the quantization error in measuring step length.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and Calculation of Gait Parameters\n\nWe are given the constant forward speed $v = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and the cadence $C = 120\\,\\text{steps}\\,\\mathrm{min}^{-1}$. Cadence is defined as the number of steps taken per unit time. To work with SI units, we convert the cadence from steps per minute to steps per second.\n$$\nC = 120\\,\\frac{\\text{steps}}{\\text{min}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\text{min}}{60\\,\\mathrm{s}} = 2\\,\\frac{\\text{steps}}{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nThis value represents the step frequency. The time duration of a single step, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}}$, is the reciprocal of the cadence (when expressed in steps per second).\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\frac{1}{C} = \\frac{1}{2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem defines step length, $L_{\\mathrm{step}}$, as the forward distance advanced per step, which can be written as $L_{\\mathrm{step}} = x(t_{n+1}) - x(t_n)$, where $t_{n+1} - t_n = \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}}$. Since the subject walks at a constant speed $v = \\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t$, the distance covered in a time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by $\\Delta x = v \\Delta t$. For a single step, the distance is the step length and the time interval is the step duration.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{step}} = v \\cdot \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\frac{v}{C}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\frac{1.25\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 0.625\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nA stride is defined as one full gait cycle, comprising two consecutive steps (e.g., a left step followed by a right step). The stride length, $L_{\\mathrm{stride}}$, is the forward distance advanced over these two steps. Based on the assumption of bilateral symmetry (equal mean length for left and right steps), the stride length is simply twice the step length.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{stride}} = 2 L_{\\mathrm{step}}\n$$\nAlternatively, the duration of a stride is $2\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}}$, so the distance covered is:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{stride}} = v \\cdot (2 \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{step}}) = \\frac{2v}{C}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{stride}} = 2 \\times 0.625\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.25\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answers to four significant figures.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{step}} = 0.6250\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{stride}} = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Analysis of Quantization Error\n\nWe now consider the measurement of footfall positions using a pressure-sensing walkway with a square grid of pitch $g = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Let the true continuous forward position of the $n$-th footfall centroid be $p_n$. The walkway reports a measured position, $\\hat{p}_n$, by rounding $p_n$ to the nearest grid node. The position of a grid node can be written as $k \\cdot g$ for some integer $k$.\n\nThe rounding error for a single position measurement is $\\epsilon_n = \\hat{p}_n - p_n$. The assumption of \"random phase alignment\" implies that the footfall centroid is equally likely to be at any position relative to the grid nodes. This means the error $\\epsilon_n$ for a single measurement is a random variable that follows a continuous uniform distribution on the interval $[ -g/2, g/2 ]$.\n\nThe true step length is $L_{\\mathrm{step}} = p_{n+1} - p_n$.\nThe measured step length is $\\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{step}} = \\hat{p}_{n+1} - \\hat{p}_n$.\n\nThe error in the step length measurement, $\\Delta L$, is the difference between the measured and true values:\n$$\n\\Delta L = \\hat{L}_{\\mathrm{step}} - L_{\\mathrm{step}} = (\\hat{p}_{n+1} - \\hat{p}_n) - (p_{n+1} - p_n)\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we express the step length error in terms of the individual position errors:\n$$\n\\Delta L = (\\hat{p}_{n+1} - p_{n+1}) - (\\hat{p}_n - p_n) = \\epsilon_{n+1} - \\epsilon_n\n$$\nThe problem states to assume that successive rounding errors are independent. Therefore, $\\epsilon_n$ and $\\epsilon_{n+1}$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables from the uniform distribution $U(-g/2, g/2)$.\n\nFirst, we characterize the expected mean of this error. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\nE[\\Delta L] = E[\\epsilon_{n+1} - \\epsilon_n] = E[\\epsilon_{n+1}] - E[\\epsilon_n]\n$$\nThe expected value (mean) of a uniform distribution $U(a,b)$ is $(a+b)/2$. For our error distribution $U(-g/2, g/2)$, the mean is:\n$$\nE[\\epsilon_n] = E[\\epsilon_{n+1}] = \\frac{(-g/2) + (g/2)}{2} = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the expected mean of the step length measurement error is:\n$$\nE[\\Delta L] = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nThis result indicates that the measurement process is unbiased; on average, it does not systematically over- or underestimate the step length.\n\nNext, we characterize the root-mean-square (RMS) of the error. The RMS error is defined as $\\sqrt{E[(\\Delta L)^2]}$. Since the mean error $E[\\Delta L]$ is $0$, the RMS error is equal to the standard deviation of $\\Delta L$, $\\sigma_{\\Delta L} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L)}$.\n\nThe variance of $\\Delta L$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_{n+1} - \\epsilon_n)\n$$\nBecause $\\epsilon_n$ and $\\epsilon_{n+1}$ are independent, the variance of their difference is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_{n+1}) + \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_n)\n$$\nThe variance of a uniform distribution $U(a,b)$ is $(b-a)^2/12$. For our error distribution $U(-g/2, g/2)$, the variance is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_n) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\epsilon_{n+1}) = \\frac{(g/2 - (-g/2))^2}{12} = \\frac{g^2}{12}\n$$\nThus, the variance of the step length error is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L) = \\frac{g^2}{12} + \\frac{g^2}{12} = \\frac{2g^2}{12} = \\frac{g^2}{6}\n$$\nThe RMS error is the square root of this variance:\n$$\n\\text{RMS}(\\Delta L) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\Delta L)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{g^2}{6}} = \\frac{g}{\\sqrt{6}}\n$$\nIn summary, the quantization error for the step length measurement has an expected mean of $0$ and an RMS value of $g/\\sqrt{6}$, where $g$ is the grid pitch of the measurement system.",

Five consecutive right-foot stride times (time between successive right heel strikes) are recorded by a high-speed optical footswitch system with timing precision sufficient for human gait analysis.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in biomechanics and statistics, well-posed, objective, self-contained, and internally consistent.\n\nThe five observed stride times, in seconds, are given as a sample $x$: $x_1 = 1.04$, $x_2 = 1.06$, $x_3 = 1.02$, $x_4 = 1.05$, $x_5 = 1.03$. The sample size is $n=5$. The problem instructs to treat these as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample.\n\nFirst, we compute the sample mean stride time, denoted by $\\mu$ as per the problem's notation. The foundational definition of the sample mean is the arithmetic average of the observations:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{5} (1.04 + 1.06 + 1.02 + 1.05 + 1.03) = \\frac{5.20}{5} = 1.04 \\, \\text{s}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the sample standard deviation, denoted by $\\sigma$.

Let the observed stride time, $T_{obs}$, be modeled as the sum of the true underlying physiological stride time, $T_{phys}$, and a random measurement error, $E_{meas}$, representing the jitter.\n$$\nT_{obs} = T_{phys} + E_{meas}\n$$\nThe problem states to assume independence between the physiological fluctuations and the measurement jitter. A fundamental principle of probability theory is that for two independent random variables, the variance of their sum is the sum of their individual variances. Invoking this principle of variance additivity:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(T_{obs}) = \\text{Var}(T_{phys}) + \\text{Var}(E_{meas})\n$$\nThis relationship is often written using sigma notation for variance, $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{obs} = \\sigma^2_{phys} + \\sigma^2_{meas}\n$$\nThe sample variance we calculated, $\\sigma^2 = 0.00025 \\, \\text{s}^2$, is an empirical estimate of the total observed variance, $\\sigma^2_{obs}$. The problem provides the standard deviation of the measurement jitter, $\\sigma_{meas} = 0.002 \\, \\text{s}$, which gives a measurement variance of $\\sigma^2_{meas} = (0.002)^2 = 0.000004 \\, \\text{s}^2$.\n\nFrom the variance additivity equation, it is clear that the observed variance, $\\sigma^2_{obs}$, is the sum of the true physiological variance and the variance introduced by the measurement system. Therefore, the observed variance is necessarily greater than the true physiological variance ($\\sigma^2_{obs}  \\sigma^2_{phys}$), as long as there is any measurement jitter ($\\sigma^2_{meas}  0$). Consequently, the observed standard deviation, $\\sigma_{obs} = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2_{phys} + \\sigma^2_{meas}}$, is an overestimate of the true physiological standard deviation, $\\sigma_{phys}$. The measurement process artificially inflates the measured variability, making the stride-to-stride timing appear less consistent than it is physiologically. To obtain a more accurate estimate of the true biological variability, one would need to subtract the known measurement variance from the observed variance before calculating the standard deviation.\n$$\n\\sigma^2_{phys} = \\sigma^2_{obs} - \\sigma^2_{meas}\n$$\nThis correction shows that the measurement jitter contributes to the observed variability, and failing to account for it leads to a systematic overestimation of the physiological variability inherent in the human gait pattern. The calculated CV, being based on the observed standard deviation, is likewise an inflated estimate of the true physiological coefficient of variation.",

Assume a perfectly symmetric and alternating walk in which the right limb’s stance onset is phase-shifted by half a cycle relative to the left limb. Let the stance state of the left limb be represented by a periodic indicator function $S_{L}(t)$ that equals $1$ during stance and $0$ during swing, and similarly define $S_{R}(t)$ for the right limb.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for the double support fraction, $D(\\beta)$, in a symmetric, alternating planar walk. The derivation will proceed by formally defining the stance indicator functions for the left and right limbs and then computing the average value of their product over one gait cycle.\n\nLet the gait cycle be defined over the time interval $[0, T)$, where $T$ is the period.\n\nFirst, we define the indicator function for the left limb's stance phase, $S_L(t)$. The stance duration is given as $\\beta T$. Without loss of generality, we can set the onset of the left limb's stance to $t=0$. The stance phase for the left limb thus occupies the interval $[0, \\beta T)$. For a single period, the function is:\n$$\nS_L(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{for } 0 \\le t  \\beta T \\\\\n0  \\text{for } \\beta T \\le t  T\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis function is then extended periodically with period $T$.\n\nNext, we define the indicator function for the right limb's stance phase, $S_R(t)$. The problem states that the right limb's stance onset is phase-shifted by half a cycle, or $T/2$, relative to the left limb. Therefore, the right limb's stance phase begins at $t=T/2$ and also has a duration of $\\beta T$. The stance interval for the right limb starts at $T/2$ and ends at $T/2 + \\beta T$.\n\nThe problem specifies that we are interested in the case where $\\beta \\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$. For this range of $\\beta$, we have $\\beta T  T/2$, which implies that $T/2 + \\beta T  T$. This means the stance interval for the right limb, $[T/2, T/2 + \\beta T)$, wraps around the end of the primary period $[0, T)$. We can split this interval into two parts by considering the periodicity of the gait cycle:\n1.  The first part of the stance is from $t = T/2$ to the end of the period, $t = T$. This interval is $[T/2, T)$.\n2.  The second part of the stance wraps around to the beginning of the next period. Due to periodicity, this is equivalent to an interval starting at $t=0$. The duration of the first part was $T - T/2 = T/2$. The total stance duration is $\\beta T$, so the remaining duration is $\\beta T - T/2 = (\\beta - 1/2)T$. This second part of the stance phase thus corresponds to the interval $[0, (\\beta - 1/2)T)$.\n\nCombining these two parts, the set of times within one period $[0, T)$ where the right limb is in stance is $[0, (\\beta - 1/2)T) \\cup [T/2, T)$. The indicator function $S_R(t)$ for $\\beta \\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ is:\n$$\nS_R(t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n1  \\text{for } t \\in [0, (\\beta - \\frac{1}{2})T) \\cup [T/2, T) \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise within } [0,T)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe double support fraction $D(\\beta)$ is defined as the time average of the product $S_L(t)S_R(t)$:\n$$\nD(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} S_{L}(t)\\,S_{R}(t)\\,dt\n$$\nThe product $S_L(t)S_R(t)$ is equal to $1$ only when both limbs are in stance simultaneously (i.e., during double support), and is $0$ otherwise. The value of the integral is therefore the total duration of the double support phase within one cycle. To find this duration, we need to find the measure of the intersection of the stance intervals of the left and right limbs.\n\nThe left limb stance interval is $I_L = [0, \\beta T)$.\nThe right limb stance interval is $I_R = [0, (\\beta - 1/2)T) \\cup [T/2, T)$.\n\nThe intersection $I_{DS} = I_L \\cap I_R$ is the union of the intersections of $I_L$ with each part of $I_R$:\n$$\nI_{DS} = \\left( [0, \\beta T) \\cap [0, (\\beta - \\frac{1}{2})T) \\right) \\cup \\left( [0, \\beta T) \\cap [T/2, T) \\right)\n$$\nLet's evaluate each part of this union:\n1.  For the first part, $[0, \\beta T) \\cap [0, (\\beta - 1/2)T)$: Since $\\beta  1/2$, it follows that $\\beta  \\beta - 1/2$, and thus $\\beta T  (\\beta - 1/2)T$. The intersection is therefore the smaller of the two intervals, which is $[0, (\\beta - 1/2)T)$. The duration of this interval is $(\\beta - 1/2)T$.\n2.  For the second part, $[0, \\beta T) \\cap [T/2, T)$: Since we are given $\\beta  1/2$, we have $\\beta T  T/2$, so the intervals overlap. The intersection is $[T/2, \\beta T)$. The duration of this interval is $\\beta T - T/2 = (\\beta - 1/2)T$.\n\nThe two resulting intervals, $[0, (\\beta - 1/2)T)$ and $[T/2, \\beta T)$, represent the two phases of double support within one gait cycle. The total duration of double support is the sum of their lengths:\n$$\n\\text{Total Duration} = (\\beta - \\frac{1}{2})T + (\\beta - \\frac{1}{2})T = 2(\\beta - \\frac{1}{2})T = (2\\beta - 1)T\n$$\nThe integral is therefore:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} S_L(t) S_R(t) dt = (2\\beta - 1)T\n$$\nNow, we can find the double support fraction $D(\\beta)$:\n$$\nD(\\beta) = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( (2\\beta - 1)T \\right) = 2\\beta - 1\n$$\nThis expression is valid for the specified domain $\\beta \\in (\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the boundary case by taking the limit as $\\beta$ approaches $1/2$ from the right:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\beta \\to \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{+}} D(\\beta) = \\lim_{\\beta \\to \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{+}} (2\\beta - 1) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0\n$$\nThis result is physically meaningful. At $\\beta = 1/2$, the stance phase of one limb ($1/2 T$) ends precisely at the moment the stance phase of the other limb begins. There is no temporal overlap between the stance phases, so the \"measure of the overlap set\" (the duration of double support) is zero. This point, $\\beta=1/2$, represents the theoretical boundary between walking (which has a double support phase, $\\beta  1/2$) and running (which has a flight phase, $\\beta  1/2$). The derived formula correctly captures this transition.\n\nThe final answer is the closed-form expression for $D(\\beta)$.",
