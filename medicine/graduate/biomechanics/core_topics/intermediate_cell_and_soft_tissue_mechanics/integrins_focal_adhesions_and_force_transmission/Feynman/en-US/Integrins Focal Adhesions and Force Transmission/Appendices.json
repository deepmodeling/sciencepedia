            "problem": "Consider a cell membrane forming a focal adhesion with an extracellular matrix coated in ligands. Integrin receptors on the membrane bind ligands across the adhesive interface. Assume one-to-one binding, no cooperativity, and uniform distributions so that binding can be treated as occurring between two well-mixed two-dimensional planes. Let the total surface density of integrin receptors be $\\rho_{R}$, the total ligand surface density be $\\rho_{L}$, and the two-dimensional (2D) dissociation constant be $K_{d}^{2D}$. At thermal equilibrium, use the two-dimensional law of mass action together with conservation of mass on each surface to derive a closed-form analytic expression for the fractional receptor occupancy per unit area, defined as $\\theta = \\rho_{RL} / \\rho_{R}$, where $\\rho_{RL}$ is the bound complex surface density.

            "solution": "The problem is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the established principles of chemical kinetics (law of mass action) and conservation of mass, applied to a standard model of receptor-ligand binding in cell biology. The parameters and objective are clearly defined, allowing for a rigorous mathematical derivation. Therefore, a full solution is warranted.\n\nThe binding process between receptors ($R$) and ligands ($L$) to form complexes ($RL$) can be represented by the reversible reaction:\n$$\nR + L \\rightleftharpoons RL\n$$\nAt thermal equilibrium, the relationship between the surface densities of the free species and the bound complex is governed by the two-dimensional ($2D$) law of mass action. The $2D$ dissociation constant, $K_{d}^{2D}$, is defined as:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} = \\frac{\\rho_{R, \\text{free}} \\rho_{L, \\text{free}}}{\\rho_{RL}}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{R, \\text{free}}$ is the surface density of free (unbound) receptors, $\\rho_{L, \\text{free}}$ is the surface density of free (unbound) ligands, and $\\rho_{RL}$ is the surface density of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe system must also obey the principle of mass conservation for both receptors and ligands. The total surface densities, $\\rho_{R}$ and $\\rho_{L}$, are constant and are partitioned between the free and bound states:\n$$\n\\rho_{R} = \\rho_{R, \\text{free}} + \\rho_{RL}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{L} = \\rho_{L, \\text{free}} + \\rho_{RL}\n$$\nFrom these conservation equations, we can express the free densities in terms of the total densities and the bound complex density:\n$$\n\\rho_{R, \\text{free}} = \\rho_{R} - \\rho_{RL}\n$$\n$$\n\\rho_{L, \\text{free}} = \\rho_{L} - \\rho_{RL}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for the free densities into the law of mass action equation yields:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} = \\frac{(\\rho_{R} - \\rho_{RL})(\\rho_{L} - \\rho_{RL})}{\\rho_{RL}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression for the fractional receptor occupancy, $\\theta$, which is defined as $\\theta = \\frac{\\rho_{RL}}{\\rho_{R}}$. We can rearrange this to express $\\rho_{RL}$ in terms of $\\theta$ and $\\rho_{R}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{RL} = \\theta \\rho_{R}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\rho_{RL}$ into the equation for $K_{d}^{2D}$:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} = \\frac{(\\rho_{R} - \\theta \\rho_{R})(\\rho_{L} - \\theta \\rho_{R})}{\\theta \\rho_{R}}\n$$\nWe can factor out $\\rho_{R}$ from the first term in the numerator and cancel it with the $\\rho_{R}$ in the denominator:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} = \\frac{\\rho_{R}(1 - \\theta)(\\rho_{L} - \\theta \\rho_{R})}{\\theta \\rho_{R}} = \\frac{(1 - \\theta)(\\rho_{L} - \\theta \\rho_{R})}{\\theta}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\theta$, we rearrange this equation into a polynomial form. First, multiply both sides by $\\theta$:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} \\theta = (1 - \\theta)(\\rho_{L} - \\theta \\rho_{R})\n$$\nExpand the right-hand side:\n$$\nK_{d}^{2D} \\theta = \\rho_{L} - \\theta \\rho_{R} - \\theta \\rho_{L} + \\theta^2 \\rho_{R}\n$$\nGroup all terms on one side to form a standard quadratic equation of the form $a\\theta^2 + b\\theta + c = 0$:\n$$\n(\\rho_{R})\\theta^2 - (\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})\\theta + \\rho_{L} = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\theta$ with coefficients $a = \\rho_{R}$, $b = -(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})$, and $c = \\rho_{L}$. We can solve for $\\theta$ using the quadratic formula, $\\theta = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}) \\pm \\sqrt{(-(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}))^2 - 4(\\rho_{R})(\\rho_{L})}}{2\\rho_{R}}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}) \\pm \\sqrt{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})^2 - 4\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}}{2\\rho_{R}}\n$$\nThis gives two possible mathematical solutions for $\\theta$. We must select the physically admissible branch that satisfies the constraint $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$ for all non-negative parameter values.\n\nLet's examine the two roots. Let $\\theta_{+}$ be the solution with the plus sign and $\\theta_{-}$ be the solution with the minus sign.\nConsider the case where the ligand density is very high, $\\rho_{L} \\to \\infty$. In this scenario, we expect all receptors to become saturated, so $\\theta \\to 1$. In our quadratic equation, $(\\rho_{R})\\theta^2 - (\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})\\theta + \\rho_{L} = 0$, if we divide by $\\rho_{L}$, we get $(\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L})\\theta^2 - (\\frac{\\rho_R}{\\rho_L} + 1 + \\frac{K_d^{2D}}{\\rho_L})\\theta + 1 = 0$. As $\\rho_L \\to \\infty$, the equation simplifies to $-\\theta + 1 \\approx 0$, which gives $\\theta \\approx 1$.\n\nLet's check which root gives this result.\nFor the $\\theta_{+}$ root, the numerator is $(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}) + \\sqrt{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})^2 - 4\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}$. As $\\rho_{L} \\to \\infty$, the numerator grows approximately as $2\\rho_{L}$, so $\\theta_{+} \\approx \\frac{2\\rho_{L}}{2\\rho_{R}} = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\rho_{R}}$. Since $\\rho_{L} \\to \\infty$, this root $\\theta_{+} \\to \\infty$, which is unphysical.\n\nFor the $\\theta_{-}$ root, we face an indeterminate form $\\infty - \\infty$. We can analyze its behavior by rationalizing the numerator or using a binomial approximation. Let $S = \\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}$.\n$\\sqrt{S^2 - 4\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}} = S \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{4\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}{S^2}} \\approx S(1 - \\frac{2\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}{S^2}) = S - \\frac{2\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}{S}$ for large $S$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\theta_{-}$:\n$$\n\\theta_{-} \\approx \\frac{S - (S - \\frac{2\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}{S})}{2\\rho_{R}} = \\frac{2\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}/S}{2\\rho_{R}} = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{S} = \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}}\n$$\nAs $\\rho_{L} \\to \\infty$, $\\theta_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\rho_{L}} = 1$. This is the physically correct behavior.\n\nAnother simple check is to consider the case of no binding, which corresponds to $K_{d}^{2D} \\to \\infty$. In this limit, we expect $\\theta \\to 0$. From the approximation $\\theta_{-} \\approx \\frac{\\rho_{L}}{\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}}$, it is clear that as $K_{d}^{2D} \\to \\infty$, $\\theta_{-} \\to 0$. The $\\theta_{+}$ root, however, diverges as $\\theta_{+} \\approx \\frac{K_{d}^{2D}}{\\rho_{R}} \\to \\infty$.\n\nTherefore, the physically correct solution corresponds to the minus sign in the quadratic formula.\nThe closed-form analytic expression for the fractional receptor occupancy is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D}) - \\sqrt{(\\rho_{R} + \\rho_{L} + K_{d}^{2D})^2 - 4\\rho_{R}\\rho_{L}}}{2\\rho_{R}}\n$$\nThis expression satisfies the condition $0 \\le \\theta \\le 1$ for all physically realistic parameters ($\\rho_{R} > 0$, $\\rho_{L} \\ge 0$, $K_{d}^{2D} \\ge 0$).",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established biophysical models (the molecular clutch hypothesis), mathematically well-posed, objective, and provides a complete and consistent set of information for a computational solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the steady-state traction force, $F_t(v)$, as a function of actin retrograde velocity, $v$, based on an ensemble molecular clutch model. The solution follows the theoretical framework and computational scheme outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we analyze the components of the model. The force $f$ on a single integrin-ligand bond is assumed to increase linearly with time, $f(t) = rt$, due to a constant loading rate $r = k_b v$, where $k_b$ is the bond stiffness and $v$ is the actin velocity.

These integrals do not have general analytical solutions and must be computed numerically. The integrands, $S(f)$ and $fS(f)$, decay to zero very rapidly as $f \\to \\infty$ due to the slip-bond term $e^{f/f_s}$ in the exponent of $S(f)$. This makes numerical quadrature feasible. We can replace the infinite upper limit with a sufficiently large finite value, $f_{\\mathrm{max}}$, such that the integrand beyond this point is negligible. Given that the characteristic forces $f_c$ and $f_s$ are of the order of $10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{N}$, an upper limit of $f_{\\mathrm{max}} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$ is a safe choice. The numerical integration is performed using the `quad` function from the `scipy.integrate` library.\n\nAt steady state, the fraction of the $N$ available integrins that are bound is determined by the balance of on- and off-rates:\n$$\nn = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}}\n$$\nThe total traction force $F_t(v)$ is the product of the total number of bonds $N$, the fraction of bound bonds $n$, and the average force per bond $\\langle f_b \\rangle$:\n$$\nF_t(v) = N \\cdot n \\cdot \\langle f_b \\rangle = N \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + k_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}} \\langle f_b \\rangle\n$$\nSubstituting the integral expressions for $\\langle f_b \\rangle$ and $k_{\\mathrm{off,eff}}$:\n$$\nF_t(v) = N \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} + r/I_1} \\frac{I_2}{I_1}\n$$\nTo improve numerical stability, we can rearrange this formula to avoid intermediate divisions by $I_1$:\n$$\nF_t(v) = N \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_1}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_1 + r} \\frac{I_2}{I_1} = \\frac{N k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_2}{k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_1 + r}\n$$\nThis is the final expression implemented in the code for any $v > 0$. For the boundary case $v=0$, the loading rate $r=0$, leading to $f(t)=0$ for any attached bond. The problem specifies that in this limit, the force transmitted is zero, so $F_t(0) = 0$.\n\nThe overall computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  For each specified velocity $v$:\n2.  If $v = 0$, the force $F_t(v)$ is $0$.\n3.  If $v > 0$, calculate the loading rate $r = k_b v$.\n4.  Construct the functions for the integrands $S(f)$ and $fS(f)$, using the analytical form of $K(f)$.\n5.  Numerically compute the integrals $I_1 = \\int_0^{f_{\\mathrm{max}}} S(f)\\,df$ and $I_2 = \\int_0^{f_{\\mathrm{max}}} fS(f)\\,df$.\n6.  Calculate the total traction force using the stabilized formula $F_t(v) = (N k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_2) / (k_{\\mathrm{on}} I_1 + r)$.\n7.  Collect the resulting forces for all velocities across all test cases and format them as a single comma-separated list.",
