The description \"linearly deforming\" is consistent with the steady-state nature of the problem, where any deformation has already occurred, resulting in a steady configuration, which under the problem's constraints must have a uniform fluid volume fraction $n^f$.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation and Solution\n\nThe derivation begins with the conservation of linear momentum for the fluid phase within the two-phase mixture. The general form of this balance law is:\n$$\n\\rho^f \\frac{D^f \\mathbf{v}^f}{D t} = \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^f + \\mathbf{\\pi}^f + \\rho^f \\mathbf{b}^f\n$$\nwhere $\\rho^f$ is the apparent density of the fluid, $\\mathbf{v}^f$ is the fluid velocity, $\\frac{D^f}{D t}$ is the material time derivative following the fluid motion, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^f$ is the partial Cauchy stress tensor for the fluid, $\\mathbf{\\pi}^f$ is the momentum supply term representing the interaction drag from the solid phase, and $\\mathbf{b}^f$ is the body force per unit mass.\n\nWe apply the assumptions given in the problem statement to simplify this equation:\n1.  **Quasi-static flow with negligible inertia**: The acceleration term on the left-hand side is zero. $\\rho^f \\frac{D^f \\mathbf{v}^f}{D t} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n2.  **Negligible body forces**: $\\mathbf{b}^f = \\mathbf{0}$.\n3.  **Hydrostatic fluid stress**: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}^f = -p \\mathbf{I}$, where $p$ is the pore pressure and $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. The divergence of this stress is $\\nabla \\cdot (-p \\mathbf{I}) = - \\nabla p$.\n\nSubstituting these into the momentum balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\mathbf{0} = -\\nabla p + \\mathbf{\\pi}^f\n$$\nThis implies that the pressure gradient is balanced by the interaction force from the solid:\n$$\n\\nabla p = \\mathbf{\\pi}^f\n$$\nThe problem specifies a \"standard linear drag interaction\" and a \"hydraulic permeability tensor\", which together imply Darcy's law. Darcy's law relates the filtration velocity $\\mathbf{w} = n^f(\\mathbf{v}^f - \\mathbf{v}^s)$ to the pressure gradient. The law is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{k}}{\\mu_f} \\nabla p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ is the permeability tensor and $\\mu_f$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, a constant. Given that the permeability is constant and isotropic, $\\mathbf{k} = k\\mathbf{I}$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{w} = -\\frac{k}{\\mu_f} \\nabla p\n$$\nNext, we apply the principle of mass conservation. For a saturated mixture of two incompressible phases (solid and fluid), the sum of the volume balance equations yields the mixture continuity equation:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (n^s \\mathbf{v}^s + n^f \\mathbf{v}^f) = 0\n$$\nThe term in the divergence can be rewritten using the filtration velocity $\\mathbf{w}$:\n$$\nn^s \\mathbf{v}^s + n^f \\mathbf{v}^f = (1 - n^f)\\mathbf{v}^s + n^f \\mathbf{v}^f = \\mathbf{v}^s + n^f(\\mathbf{v}^f - \\mathbf{v}^s) = \\mathbf{v}^s + \\mathbf{w}\n$$\nSo the continuity equation becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot (\\mathbf{v}^s + \\mathbf{w}) = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}^s + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the solid velocity $v^s$ is spatially uniform (taken as $v^s=0$). A spatially uniform vector field has zero divergence, thus $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v}^s = 0$. This simplifies the mixture continuity equation to:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = 0\n$$\nNow we combine the momentum (Darcy's law) and continuity equations. Substituting the expression for $\\mathbf{w}$ into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{k}{\\mu_f} \\nabla p \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the permeability $k$ and viscosity $\\mu_f$ are constants, they can be factored out of the divergence operator:\n$$\n-\\frac{k}{\\mu_f} \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nAs $k>0$ and $\\mu_f>0$, this leads to the governing differential equation for the pore pressure:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\nThis is the Laplace equation. For the one-dimensional case where $p$ is a function of $x$ only, this equation reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 p}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the required governing ordinary differential equation for the pore pressure $p(x)$.\n\nTo find the explicit expression for $p(x)$, we solve this second-order ODE subject to the given boundary conditions. Integrating with respect to $x$ once gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Integrating a second time yields the general solution:\n$$\np(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. We determine these constants using the boundary conditions $p(0)=p_0$ and $p(L)=p_L$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$\np(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = p_0 \\implies C_2 = p_0\n$$\nThe solution becomes $p(x) = C_1 x + p_0$. Now, applying the second boundary condition at $x=L$:\n$$\np(L) = C_1 L + p_0 = p_L\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 L = p_L - p_0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{p_L - p_0}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution gives the explicit expression for the pore pressure profile:\n$$\np(x) = \\left( \\frac{p_L - p_0}{L} \\right) x + p_0\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the linear interpolation between the boundary values:\n$$\np(x) = p_0 - \\frac{p_0}{L}x + \\frac{p_L}{L}x = p_0 \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right) + p_L \\frac{x}{L}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the pore pressure $p(x)$ as a function of position $x$ and the boundary pressures $p_0$ and $p_L$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It represents a standard problem in the field of biomechanics, specifically poroelasticity, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is structured in three parts, following the problem's directives.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Governing Equation and Consolidation Coefficient**\n\nThe one-dimensional (1D) consolidation of a poroelastic medium is governed by three fundamental principles: conservation of mass, Darcy's law for fluid flow, and the effective stress principle combined with a constitutive law for the solid matrix.\n\nFirst, we consider the conservation of mass. For a saturated porous medium with incompressible fluid and solid constituents under small strain, the rate of change of volume of a representative element of the solid skeleton must be balanced by the net rate of fluid flow into or out of it. In one dimension, where the only non-zero strain component is the axial strain $\\epsilon_z$, this principle is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_z}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial w_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon_z(z,t)$ is the axial strain of the solid matrix and $w_z(z,t)$ is the specific discharge of the fluid relative to the solid matrix (also known as the seepage velocity) in the $z$-direction.\n\nSecond, Darcy's law relates the seepage velocity to the gradient of the excess pore fluid pressure, $p(z,t)$. In one dimension, this is:\n$$\nw_z = -k \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\n$$\nwhere $k$ is the Darcy permeability of the tissue. Substituting Darcy's law into the mass conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_z}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(-k \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\\right) = k \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nassuming the permeability $k$ is constant.\n\nThird, the principle of effective stress states that the total stress $\\sigma_z$ is supported by both the solid matrix (effective stress, $\\sigma'_z$) and the pore fluid (pore pressure, $p$).\n$$\n\\sigma_z(z,t) = \\sigma'_z(z,t) + p(z,t)\n$$\nThe problem specifies a linear elastic constitutive relation for the solid matrix under confined compression, where the effective stress is proportional to the axial strain:\n$$\n\\sigma'_z = H \\epsilon_z\n$$\nHere, $H$ is the constrained modulus of the solid matrix, also known as the oedometric modulus. Substituting this into the effective stress equation gives:\n$$\n\\sigma_z = H \\epsilon_z + p\n$$\nTo obtain the standard diffusion-type equation for pore pressure, we consider the case of consolidation under a constant total applied stress, $\\sigma_z = \\sigma_0$. Differentiating the constitutive relation with respect to time $t$ while holding $\\sigma_z$ constant yields:\n$$\n0 = H \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_z}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} \\implies \\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_z}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{1}{H} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions derived for $\\frac{\\partial \\epsilon_z}{\\partial t}$:\n$$\nk \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} = -\\frac{1}{H} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}\n$$\nRearranging this gives the governing diffusion equation for excess pore pressure:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = kH \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}\n$$\nThis is the standard form of the 1D consolidation equation, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$. By comparison, the consolidation coefficient $c_v$ is defined as:\n$$\nc_v = kH\n$$\nThe coefficient of volume compressibility, $m_v$, is defined as the change in volumetric strain per unit change in effective stress. Under oedometric conditions, the volumetric strain is simply the axial strain, $\\epsilon_z$. Thus, $m_v = \\frac{d\\epsilon_z}{d\\sigma'_z}$. From the linear constitutive law $\\sigma'_z = H\\epsilon_z$, we have $\\frac{d\\sigma'_z}{d\\epsilon_z} = H$. Therefore, $m_v = \\frac{1}{H}$. This means that the oedometric modulus $H$ is the inverse of the coefficient of volume compressibility. We can then express the consolidation coefficient as:\n$$\nc_v = \\frac{k}{m_v}\n$$\n\n**2. Relationship between $c_v$, $h$, and $t_{1/2}$**\n\nWe analyze the boundary-value problem for a specimen of thickness $h$ that is double-drained. This corresponds to the diffusion equation $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2}$ on the domain $z \\in [0, h]$ with boundary conditions $p(0,t)=0$ and $p(h,t)=0$. For a step change in conditions at $t=0$, the solution can be expressed as a Fourier sine series:\n$$\np(z,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi z}{h}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{n^2 \\pi^2 c_v t}{h^2}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the consolidation response is dominated by the principal mode, which corresponds to the first term of the series ($n=1$). The decay of this mode is governed by the exponential term $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi^2 c_v t}{h^2}\\right)$.\nComparing this to a standard exponential decay process, $\\exp(-t/\\tau)$, the characteristic time constant $\\tau$ for the principal mode is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{h^2}{\\pi^2 c_v}\n$$\nThis establishes the relationship between $\\tau$, $c_v$, and $h$.\n\nIn a stress relaxation test (constant strain), the excess axial force, which is proportional to the average excess pore pressure, also decays with the same time constant. Let the normalized excess force be $F_{norm}(t) = \\frac{F(t) - F_{eq}}{F_0 - F_{eq}}$, where $F_0$ is the initial force and $F_{eq}$ is the equilibrium force. This normalized force decays approximately as $F_{norm}(t) \\approx \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. The half-time of relaxation, $t_{1/2}$, is the time at which this normalized force has decayed to $1/2$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-t_{1/2}/\\tau)\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\ln(2) = -\\frac{t_{1/2}}{\\tau} \\implies t_{1/2} = \\tau \\ln(2)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau$ gives the relationship between $t_{1/2}$, $c_v$, and $h$:\n$$\nt_{1/2} = \\frac{h^2 \\ln(2)}{\\pi^2 c_v}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the consolidation coefficient $c_v$:\n$$\nc_v = \\frac{h^2 \\ln(2)}{\\pi^2 t_{1/2}}\n$$\n\n**3. Calculation of the Consolidation Coefficient**\n\nThe problem provides the following experimental data from a confined compression relaxation test:\n- Specimen thickness: $h = 1.50$ mm\n- Half-time of relaxation: $t_{1/2} = 440$ s\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are in the SI base system. The thickness $h$ must be converted from millimeters to meters:\n$$\nh = 1.50 \\,\\text{mm} = 1.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the values of $h$ and $t_{1/2}$ into the formula derived in part 2:\n$$\nc_v = \\frac{(1.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m})^2 \\ln(2)}{\\pi^2 (440 \\,\\text{s})}\n$$\nLet's compute the terms:\n$$\nh^2 = (1.50 \\times 10^{-3})^2 \\,\\text{m}^2 = 2.25 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}^2\n$$\nUsing the values for the constants $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$ and $\\pi^2 \\approx 9.869604$:\n$$\nc_v = \\frac{(2.25 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.693147}{9.869604 \\times 440} \\,\\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nc_v = \\frac{1.55958 \\times 10^{-6}}{4342.626} \\,\\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{s}}\n$$\n$$\nc_v \\approx 3.5913 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{s}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nc_v = 3.59 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\frac{\\text{m}^2}{\\text{s}}\n$$\nThis is the value for the consolidation coefficient computed from the relaxation data using the principal-mode approximation.",

We need to compute the derivative of $k(n^f)$ with respect to $n^f$.\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dn^f} = \\frac{d}{dn^f} \\left[ k_0 \\left( \\frac{n^f}{n_0^f} \\right)^m \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out the constants $k_0$ and $(n_0^f)^{-m}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dk}{dn^f} = k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} \\frac{d}{dn^f} [ (n^f)^m ] = k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} [ m (n^f)^{m-1} ]\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the reference state $n^f = n_0^f$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{dk}{dn^f} \\right|_{n^f=n_0^f} = k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} [ m (n_0^f)^{m-1} ] = m k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m+m-1} = m k_0 (n_0^f)^{-1} = \\frac{m k_0}{n_0^f}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the Taylor expansion formula, we obtain the linearization:\n$$\nk(n^f) \\approx k_0 + \\frac{m k_0}{n_0^f} (n^f - n_0^f)\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to highlight the perturbation from the reference state:\n$$\nk(n^f) \\approx k_0 \\left( 1 + m \\frac{n^f - n_0^f}{n_0^f} \\right)\n$$\nThis linear relationship quantifies how small changes in porosity, represented by the dimensionless strain-like term $\\frac{n^f - n_0^f}{n_0^f}$, lead to proportional changes in permeability around the reference state $k_0$.\n\n**Part 2: Logarithmic Sensitivity**\nThe second task is to find the logarithmic sensitivity $S$, defined as:\n$$\nS = \\left. \\frac{d\\ln k}{d\\ln n^f} \\right|_{n^f=n_0^f}\n$$\nA direct way to compute this is to first take the natural logarithm of the permeability function $k(n^f)$:\n$$\n\\ln k(n^f) = \\ln \\left[ k_0 \\left( \\frac{n^f}{n_0^f} \\right)^m \\right]\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln k(n^f) = \\ln k_0 + \\ln \\left[ \\left( \\frac{n^f}{n_0^f} \\right)^m \\right] = \\ln k_0 + m \\ln \\left( \\frac{n^f}{n_0^f} \\right) = \\ln k_0 + m (\\ln n^f - \\ln n_0^f)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate this expression for $\\ln k$ with respect to $\\ln n^f$. Let $x = \\ln n^f$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n\\ln k = \\ln k_0 + m (x - \\ln n_0^f)\n$$\nThe derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln k)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} [ \\ln k_0 + m (x - \\ln n_0^f) ]\n$$\nSince $\\ln k_0$, $m$, and $\\ln n_0^f$ are constants with respect to the variable of differentiation $x = \\ln n^f$, the derivative simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln k)}{d(\\ln n^f)} = m\n$$\nThis result is a constant, independent of the value of $n^f$. Therefore, evaluating it at the reference state $n^f = n_0^f$ does not change its value.\n$$\nS = \\left. \\frac{d\\ln k}{d\\ln n^f} \\right|_{n^f=n_0^f} = m\n$$\nThe logarithmic sensitivity of permeability to porosity is simply the microstructural exponent $m$. This implies that for a power-law relationship, the exponent itself represents the constant elasticity or sensitivity in a log-log plot of the variables.\n\nAlternatively, using the chain rule on the definition of $S$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln k}{d\\ln n^f} = \\frac{d(\\ln k)/dn^f}{d(\\ln n^f)/dn^f} = \\frac{(1/k) (dk/dn^f)}{(1/n^f)} = \\frac{n^f}{k} \\frac{dk}{dn^f}\n$$\nFrom earlier, $\\frac{dk}{dn^f} = k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} m (n^f)^{m-1}$.\nSubstituting this and $k = k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} (n^f)^m$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln k}{d\\ln n^f} = \\frac{n^f}{k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} (n^f)^m} \\left( k_0 (n_0^f)^{-m} m (n^f)^{m-1} \\right) = \\frac{n^f \\cdot m \\cdot (n^f)^{m-1}}{(n^f)^m} = \\frac{m (n^f)^m}{(n^f)^m} = m\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the derivation. The problem asks for the expression for $S$ in terms of $m$, which is simply $m$.",
