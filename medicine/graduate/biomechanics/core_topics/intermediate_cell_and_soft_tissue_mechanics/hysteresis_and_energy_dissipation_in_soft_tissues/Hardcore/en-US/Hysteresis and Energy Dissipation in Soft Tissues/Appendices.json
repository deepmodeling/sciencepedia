The Maxwell model is a fundamental and standard representation of linear viscoelastic behavior in materials science and biomechanics. The provided constitutive equation correctly describes a Maxwell element. The use of complex modulus to analyze the response to sinusoidal loading is a standard and powerful technique in the field of rheology and viscoelasticity.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed.

It is a standard textbook model used to introduce the concepts of viscoelasticity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is a standard exercise in linear viscoelasticity theory. The solution process may now proceed.\n\nThe derivation begins by transforming the time-domain constitutive relation into the frequency domain using a complex exponential representation for the sinusoidal signals. A general sinusoidal strain and stress at angular frequency $\\omega$ can be represented in complex form as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ are the complex amplitudes of strain and stress, respectively. The physical quantities are typically taken as the real or imaginary parts of these complex representations. The complex amplitudes $\\hat{\\varepsilon}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$ are generally complex numbers, with their arguments representing phase shifts.\n\nThe time derivatives of these signals are:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t}) = i\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t} = i\\omega \\varepsilon(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\sigma}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(\\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}) = i\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t} = i\\omega \\sigma(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these complex forms into the given constitutive relation, $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\eta} + \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}$, yields:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon}e^{i\\omega t} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t}}{\\eta} + \\frac{1}{E}(i\\omega \\hat{\\sigma}e^{i\\omega t})\n$$\nThe common factor $e^{i\\omega t}$ can be canceled from every term, leaving a relationship between the complex amplitudes:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E}\\hat{\\sigma}\n$$\nWe can factor out $\\hat{\\sigma}$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\ni\\omega \\hat{\\varepsilon} = \\hat{\\sigma} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E} \\right)\n$$\nThe complex modulus $E^{*}(\\omega)$ is defined as the ratio of the complex stress amplitude to the complex strain amplitude, $E^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for this ratio:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}} = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\frac{1}{\\eta} + \\frac{i\\omega}{E}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we find a common denominator for the term in the parentheses:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega}{\\frac{E + i\\omega\\eta}{E\\eta}}\n$$\nInverting the denominator and multiplying gives the first required expression:\n$$\nE^{*}(\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega E\\eta}{E + i\\omega\\eta}\n$$\nThis is the expression for the complex modulus in terms of $E$, $\\eta$, and $\\omega$.\n\nThe second task is to find the loss modulus, $E''(\\omega)$, which is the imaginary part of $E^{*}(\\omega)$. To do this, we must separate the expression for $E^{*}(\\omega)$ into its real and imaginary parts.

By definition, the loss modulus is:\n$$\nE''(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega E^2\\eta}{E^2 + \\omega^2\\eta^2}\n$$\nThis is the second required expression, given only in terms of $E$, $\\eta$, and $\\omega$.\n\nThe two derived expressions are:\n1.

Over a complete cycle, the net change in stored energy is zero:\n$$\\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} E\\,\\varepsilon(t)\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = E \\int_{\\varepsilon(0)}^{\\varepsilon(2\\pi/\\omega)} \\varepsilon\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon = E \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}\\varepsilon^2 \\right]_{\\varepsilon(0)}^{\\varepsilon(2\\pi/\\omega)} = 0 \\quad (\\text{since }\\varepsilon(2\\pi/\\omega) = \\varepsilon(0))$$\nTherefore, the dissipated energy is solely due to the viscous term:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\eta \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} (\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t))^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThis general result will be used for both loading protocols.\n\n#### Protocol 1: Strain-Controlled Oscillation\n\nGiven $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$, the strain rate is:\n$$\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\cos(\\omega t)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\eta \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} (\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}\\cos(\\omega t))^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\eta\\,\\omega^2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2 \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega} \\cos^2(\\omega t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$$\nThe integral of $\\cos^2(\\omega t)$ over one period is $\\pi/\\omega$.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\eta\\,\\omega^2\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega} \\right) = \\pi\\,\\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2$$\n**Analysis for Protocol 1:**\nThe energy dissipated is exactly proportional to $\\omega$ for all frequencies.\n$$W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\propto \\omega$$\nThis means the leading-order scaling is $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\sim \\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2$ in both the low-frequency limit ($\\omega \\ll E/\\eta$) and the high-frequency limit ($\\omega \\gg E/\\eta$). There is no cross-over or change in the scaling exponent for $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ with respect to $\\omega$. Physically, the viscous stress amplitude, $\\eta \\omega \\varepsilon_0$, increases with $\\omega$, leading to more dissipation per unit time, but the cycle duration decreases as $1/\\omega$. The net energy dissipated per cycle scales as $\\omega$.\n\n#### Protocol 2: Stress-Controlled Oscillation\n\nGiven $\\sigma(t) = \\sigma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$, we must solve the constitutive equation for $\\varepsilon(t)$:\n$$\\eta\\,\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) + E\\,\\varepsilon(t) = \\sigma_{0}\\sin(\\omega t)$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. The steady-state solution has the form $\\varepsilon(t) = A\\sin(\\omega t) + B\\cos(\\omega t)$.

This transition defines a cross-over, which corresponds to a peak in dissipation. The maximum $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ occurs at the frequency where $\\mathrm{d}W_{\\mathrm{d}}/\\mathrm{d}\\omega = 0$. This happens when $\\omega = E/\\eta$. Thus, the cross-over frequency is $\\omega_c \\approx E/\\eta$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under strain-controlled loading with amplitude $\\varepsilon_{0}$, the energy dissipated per cycle scales as $W_{\\mathrm{d}}\\sim \\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^{2}$ for both $\\omega\\ll E/\\eta$ and $\\omega\\gg E/\\eta$, i.e., there is no cross-over in $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ scaling with $\\omega$.**\nOur derivation for strain control yielded $W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\pi\\,\\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2$. The scaling $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\propto \\omega$ is valid for all frequencies. Therefore, the leading-order scaling relationship $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\sim \\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2$ does not change form between the low- and high-frequency limits. There is no cross-over in the scaling behavior.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under stress-controlled loading with amplitude $\\sigma_{0}$, $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ exhibits a cross-over at $\\omega_{c}\\approx E/\\eta$: for $\\omega\\ll \\omega_{c}$, $W_{\\mathrm{d}}\\sim (\\eta\\,\\omega/E^{2})\\,\\sigma_{0}^{2}$, while for $\\omega\\gg \\omega_{c}$, $W_{\\mathrm{d}}\\sim \\sigma_{0}^{2}/(\\eta\\,\\omega)$.**\nOur analysis for stress control confirms this statement precisely. We found a cross-over at $\\omega_c = E/\\eta$. For $\\omega \\ll \\omega_c$, we found $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\propto \\omega$, with the specific scaling matching the statement. For $\\omega \\gg \\omega_c$, we found $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\propto 1/\\omega$, again matching the statement's scaling.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. In a Kelvin–Voigt solid, the phase lag between stress and strain is zero for any $\\omega$, so $W_{\\mathrm{d}}=0$ under cyclic loading regardless of protocol.**\nThis is incorrect. The presence of the viscous dashpot ($\\eta > 0$) introduces a phase lag between stress and strain. For strain control, we have $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$ and $\\sigma(t) = E \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t) + \\eta\\omega\\varepsilon_0\\cos(\\omega t)$. The stress is clearly not in phase with the strain. The energy dissipation $W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ is the area of the hysteresis loop, which is non-zero if there is a phase lag. Our calculations explicitly show $W_{\\mathrm{d}} > 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The cross-over under stress control arises because the effective compliance $J^{*}(\\omega)$ transitions from being dominated by the elastic modulus $E$ at low $\\omega$ to the viscous term $\\eta\\,\\omega$ at high $\\omega$, altering how $\\mathrm{d}\\varepsilon$ scales in time relative to $\\sigma$ and hence the loop area.**\nThis provides the physical explanation for the behavior described in B. The dynamic response is governed by the complex modulus $E^*(\\omega) = E + i\\eta\\omega$. At low frequencies ($\\omega \\ll E/\\eta$), $|E^*| \\approx E$, and the material behaves like a spring. At high frequencies ($\\omega \\gg E/\\eta$), $|E^*| \\approx \\eta\\omega$, and the material's response is dominated by its viscosity. The compliance is $J^*(\\omega) = 1/E^*(\\omega)$. This transition from elastic-dominated to viscous-dominated behavior alters both the amplitude and phase of the strain response ($\\varepsilon$) to a given stress ($\\sigma$), causing the dissipation per cycle ($W_{\\mathrm{d}}$) to first increase and then decrease with frequency, creating the peak and cross-over. The statement correctly identifies this transition as the underlying cause.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Under strain control, the hysteresis loop area decreases with increasing $\\omega$ beyond $\\omega_{c}$, eventually vanishing as $\\omega\\to\\infty$.**\nThis is incorrect. Our derivation for strain control showed $W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\pi\\,\\eta\\,\\omega\\,\\varepsilon_{0}^2$. This function increases linearly with $\\omega$ for all $\\omega > 0$. It does not decrease and certainly does not vanish as $\\omega \\to \\infty$; it diverges. The behavior described in this option is characteristic of stress-controlled loading, not strain-controlled loading.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

No other shortcut formulas are permitted in the problem statement.\n\nScientific realism requirements:\n- Assume small-strain kinematics and time-periodic uniaxial excitation $\\varepsilon(t)$ of amplitude $\\varepsilon_0$ and frequency $f$.\n- Model heterogeneity by assigning distinct elastic moduli $E$ and viscous coefficients $\\eta$ to each element, resulting in different phase lags and loop areas under the same excitation.\n- Generate the synthetic FE outputs as time histories over exactly one cycle with $N+1$ samples including both endpoints to ensure the loop is closed.\n- Use units consistent with biomechanics: stress in Pascals (Pa), viscous coefficient in Pascal-seconds (Pa·s), time in seconds (s). Report $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ in Pascals (Pa), which equals Joules per cubic meter per cycle.\n\nAlgorithmic requirements (to be implemented in code and justified from first principles in the solution):\n- Parameterize the hysteresis loop by time $t \\in [0, T]$, where $T = 1/f$ and angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n- Construct the strain history $\\varepsilon(t)$ for $N+1$ samples with equal time spacing $\\Delta t = T/N$.\n- For each element, generate a stress history $\\sigma(t)$ consistent with a viscoelastic response under the same $\\varepsilon(t)$, using distinct element parameters $(E, \\eta)$ to represent heterogeneity. No inverse solution or constitutive identification is required; the stress histories are generated synthetically and then post-processed.\n- Compute $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ by numerically evaluating the closed-path integral $W_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon$ using a trapezoidal rule on the parametric curve $(\\varepsilon(t), \\sigma(t))$. The discrete formula must approximate the integral by summing over segments between consecutive samples, including the segment from the last sample back to the first to ensure a closed loop. The result must be expressed in Pascals (Pa).\n\nTest suite:\nFor all cases below, use $\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$ with $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ and $t$ sampled as $t_k = k \\Delta t$ for $k = 0, 1, \\dots, N$, where $\\Delta t = T/N$ and $T = 1/f$. The program must generate $\\sigma(t)$ for each element $i$ according to a Kelvin-Voigt-type viscoelastic response $\\sigma_i(t) = E_i \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_i \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t)$, where $\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$ is computed analytically to ensure controlled, noise-free synthetic data. Then compute element-wise $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ using the prescribed numerical trapezoidal rule in strain space.\n\n- Test Case $1$ (happy path, elastic with negligible hysteresis):\n  - Two elements with distinct stiffnesses and no viscosity to represent purely elastic behavior.\n  - Parameters: $E = [10000, 30000]$ (Pa), $\\eta = [0, 0]$ (Pa·s), $\\varepsilon_0 = 0.02$ (dimensionless), $f = 1.0$ (Hz), $N = 1000$ (samples per cycle, endpoint included via $N+1$ points).\n  - Expected qualitative outcome: $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ approximately $0$ for both elements.\n\n- Test Case $2$ (heterogeneous viscoelastic tissue, well-resolved cycle):\n  - Two elements with distinct stiffnesses and viscosities to create different hysteresis loop areas under the same excitation.\n  - Parameters: $E = [10000, 30000]$ (Pa), $\\eta = [1000, 500]$ (Pa·s), $\\varepsilon_0 = 0.02$, $f = 1.0$, $N = 4000$.\n\n- Test Case $3$ (edge case, under-sampled high-frequency cycle):\n  - Same material parameters as Test Case $2$, but with higher frequency and low number of samples, to test robustness of the numerical quadrature under coarse discretization.\n  - Parameters: $E = [10000, 30000]$ (Pa), $\\eta = [1000, 500]$ (Pa·s), $\\varepsilon_0 = 0.02$, $f = 5.0$, $N = 16$.\n\nYour program must:\n- Implement the synthetic time-history generation and the post-processing trapezoidal integral for $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for each element in each test case.\n- Produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each test case’s result is a list of element-wise $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values in Pascals. Round each $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ value to $6$ decimal places. For example, the output should look like $[[w_{11},w_{12}],[w_{21},w_{22}],[w_{31},w_{32}]]$ where $w_{ij}$ are floats in Pascals.\n\nAnswer in Pascals (Pa) and output in the exact specified single-line format.",
            "solution": "The fundamental base for computing energy dissipation density in a soft tissue under cyclic load is the work density identity from continuum mechanics. For small-strain kinematics, the incremental mechanical work per unit volume is given by $dW = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is the Cauchy stress tensor and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the small-strain tensor. Over one cycle, the hysteretic energy dissipation density equals the closed-path integral\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} : d\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}.\n$$\nUnder uniaxial loading, this simplifies to\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon,\n$$\nwhich is the area enclosed by the stress-strain loop in the $\\sigma$–$\\varepsilon$ plane. This definition is path-parametrization invariant: for any smooth parameter $\\lambda$, if the loop is traversed once, the integral $\\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon$ is independent of the speed along the loop.\n\nFor a time-parameterized cycle with period $T = 1/f$ and angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, a practical FE post-processing routine must evaluate the integral from discrete samples of $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\varepsilon(t)$ over one cycle. To ensure the loop is closed geometrically, it is essential to include both endpoints $t = 0$ and $t = T$, yielding $N+1$ samples and $N$ segments. A robust, frame-indifferent numerical quadrature is the trapezoidal rule applied directly to the parametric curve:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\sigma(t_k) + \\sigma(t_{k+1})}{2} \\left[ \\varepsilon(t_{k+1}) - \\varepsilon(t_k) \\right],\n$$\nwith $t_k = k \\Delta t$, $\\Delta t = T/N$, and $k=0,1,\\dots,N$, so that $t_0 = 0$ and $t_N = T$. This is a discrete line integral along the loop that approximates $\\oint \\sigma \\, d\\varepsilon$ without requiring explicit differentiation of $\\varepsilon(t)$ or time-domain multiplication.\n\nTo generate scientifically realistic synthetic FE outputs for a heterogeneous tissue, we employ a Kelvin-Voigt-type viscoelastic stress response at the element level:\n$$\n\\sigma_i(t) = E_i \\, \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_i \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t),\n$$\nwith element-specific parameters $(E_i, \\eta_i)$ to model heterogeneity. The strain excitation is prescribed as a sinusoid\n$$\n\\varepsilon(t) = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t),\n$$\nwith analytic time derivative\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\cos(\\omega t),\n$$\nensuring noise-free data appropriate for benchmarking the post-processing routine. Using these definitions and the trapezoidal rule on the parametric curve $(\\varepsilon(t), \\sigma_i(t))$, we compute the element-wise $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ for each test case.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation of expected qualitative behavior:\n- For purely elastic elements with $\\eta_i = 0$, we have $\\sigma_i(t) = E_i \\varepsilon(t)$. The integral over one cycle of a conservative elastic response yields\n$$\n\\oint \\sigma_i \\, d\\varepsilon = \\oint E_i \\varepsilon \\, d\\varepsilon = E_i \\oint d\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\varepsilon^2 \\right) = 0,\n$$\nsince the loop returns to the initial state. Therefore, $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 0$ (up to numerical quadrature error).\n- For viscoelastic elements with $\\eta_i > 0$, hysteresis arises from the phase-lag between stress and strain due to the viscous term. From first principles, the dissipation per cycle can be expressed by time-parametrization as\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\oint \\sigma_i \\, d\\varepsilon = \\int_0^T \\sigma_i(t) \\, \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^T \\left[ E_i \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_i \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\right] \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\, dt.\n$$\nThe elastic term integrates to zero over one cycle because $\\int_0^T \\varepsilon(t) \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) dt = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[ \\varepsilon(T)^2 - \\varepsilon(0)^2 \\right] = 0$. The viscous contribution yields\n$$\n\\int_0^T \\eta_i \\left[ \\dot{\\varepsilon}(t) \\right]^2 dt = \\eta_i \\omega^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\int_0^T \\cos^2(\\omega t) \\, dt = \\eta_i \\omega^2 \\varepsilon_0^2 \\frac{T}{2} = \\eta_i \\omega \\varepsilon_0^2 \\pi,\n$$\ndemonstrating that $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ scales with $\\eta_i$, $\\omega$, and $\\varepsilon_0^2$. This analytic relation corroborates the correctness of the trapezoidal numerical integral on $(\\varepsilon, \\sigma)$ in the code, while the implementation uses the general integral definition rather than a shortcut formula.\n\nNumerical algorithm details implemented in code:\n- For each test case, construct $t_k = k \\Delta t$, $k = 0,\\dots,N$, with $\\Delta t = T/N$ and $T = 1/f$.\n- Compute $\\varepsilon_k = \\varepsilon_0 \\sin(\\omega t_k)$ and $\\dot{\\varepsilon}_k = \\omega \\varepsilon_0 \\cos(\\omega t_k)$ for all $k$.\n- For each element $i$, compute $\\sigma_{i,k} = E_i \\varepsilon_k + \\eta_i \\dot{\\varepsilon}_k$.\n- Evaluate the trapezoidal line integral in strain space:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{d},i} \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\frac{\\sigma_{i,k} + \\sigma_{i,k+1}}{2} \\left( \\varepsilon_{k+1} - \\varepsilon_k \\right).\n$$\n- Round each $W_{\\mathrm{d},i}$ to $6$ decimal places and report in Pascals (Pa).\n\nTest suite coverage:\n- Test Case $1$ validates that purely elastic elements produce $W_{\\mathrm{d}} \\approx 0$ across heterogeneous stiffness.\n- Test Case $2$ validates that viscoelastic elements produce positive $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ in proportion to $\\eta_i$, with high-resolution sampling ($N = 4000$) ensuring convergence of the numerical integral.\n- Test Case $3$ stresses the numerical routine under coarse sampling ($N = 16$) and higher frequency ($f = 5.0$), ensuring robustness and producing approximate but still physically consistent $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nThe final program prints a single line with the nested list of $W_{\\mathrm{d}}$ values for the three test cases, rounded to $6$ decimal places, in Pascals (Pa), as required.",
