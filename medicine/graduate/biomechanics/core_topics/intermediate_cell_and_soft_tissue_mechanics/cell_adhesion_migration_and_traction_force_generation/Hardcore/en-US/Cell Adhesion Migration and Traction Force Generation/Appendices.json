            "problem": "A single actin filament pushes against a compliant membrane during lamellipodial protrusion. Model the filament as a one-dimensional ratchet that advances by insertion of single actin monomers of axial size increment $d$ against an opposing constant load force $F$ transmitted through cell adhesions. The polymerization on-rate constant at zero load is $k_p$ (per concentration per time), the depolymerization off-rate constant is $k_d$ (per time), and the free monomer concentration is $c$. The temperature is $T$, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nAssume the following fundamental bases:\n- Thermal activation controls monomer addition and loss. The net filament tip velocity $v(F)$ is the step size $d$ times the difference between the effective forward and backward event rates.\n- Under a constant opposing force $F$, insertion of a monomer requires a thermally generated tip-membrane gap of size at least $d$. The mechanical work required to open such a gap is $W=F d$.\n- The probability weight for accessing a configuration that requires reversible work $W$ is proportional to $\\exp\\!\\left(-W/(k_B T)\\right)$.\n\nUsing only these bases and conservation of detailed balance, derive an expression for the steady growth velocity $v(F)$ in terms of $k_p$, $k_d$, $c$, $d$, $F$, $k_B$, and $T$. Then determine the stall force $F_s$ defined implicitly by $v(F_s)=0$. Express your final result for $F_s$ in closed form in terms of $k_p$, $k_d$, $c$, $d$, $k_B$, and $T$. State explicitly how $F_s$ scales with $c$ based on your expression. Your final expression represents a force; express it in Newtons, but keep the expression symbolic with no numerical substitution.",
            "solution": "To derive the steady growth velocity $v(F)$, we model the net filament tip velocity as the step size $d$ multiplied by the difference between the effective forward (polymerization) rate $k_{on,eff}$ and the backward (depolymerization) rate $k_{off,eff}$.\n$$v(F) = d \\left( k_{on,eff}(F) - k_{off,eff}(F) \\right)$$\nThe intrinsic, zero-load on-rate is given by the product of the rate constant and monomer concentration, $k_{on}(0) = k_p c$. According to the Brownian ratchet model, for a monomer to be added against an opposing force $F$, the membrane must thermally fluctuate to open a gap of at least size $d$. The work required is $W = Fd$. The probability of such a fluctuation is given by the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-W/(k_B T))$. Thus, the effective on-rate under load is the zero-load rate modulated by this probability:\n$$k_{on,eff}(F) = k_{on}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Fd}{k_B T}\\right) = k_p c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Fd}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nFor the off-rate, we can use the principle of detailed balance. The total free energy change for adding a monomer is $\\Delta G_{total} = \\Delta G_{chem} + W_{mech}$, where the mechanical work is $W_{mech} = Fd$ and the chemical free energy change is $\\Delta G_{chem} = -k_B T \\ln(k_p c / k_d)$. Detailed balance requires $k_{on,eff}/k_{off,eff} = \\exp(-\\Delta G_{total}/(k_B T))$.\n$$\\frac{k_{on,eff}(F)}{k_{off,eff}(F)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{-k_B T \\ln(k_p c / k_d) + Fd}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{k_p c}{k_d} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Fd}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nUsing our expression for $k_{on,eff}(F)$, we find that this condition is satisfied if the off-rate $k_{off,eff}(F)$ is independent of force, i.e., $k_{off,eff}(F) = k_d$. This is a standard assumption in the simplest version of this model.\n\nCombining these rates, the expression for the steady growth velocity $v(F)$ is:\n$$v(F) = d \\left[ k_p c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{Fd}{k_B T}\\right) - k_d \\right]$$\nThe stall force, $F_s$, is the force at which the net velocity is zero, $v(F_s)=0$.\n$$0 = d \\left[ k_p c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F_s d}{k_B T}\\right) - k_d \\right]$$\nSince $d \\neq 0$, the term in the brackets must be zero:\n$$k_p c \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F_s d}{k_B T}\\right) = k_d$$\nWe solve for $F_s$ by isolating the exponential and taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{F_s d}{k_B T}\\right) = \\frac{k_d}{k_p c}$$\n$$-\\frac{F_s d}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_d}{k_p c}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$:\n$$\\frac{F_s d}{k_B T} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_p c}{k_d}\\right)$$\nSolving for $F_s$ gives the final expression for the stall force:\n$$F_s = \\frac{k_B T}{d} \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_p c}{k_d}\\right)$$\nThe unit of this expression is force (Newtons in SI).

Assume that bond rupture follows a Poisson process with a time-dependent dissociation rate $k(F)$ that depends only on the instantaneous force $F$.\n\nStarting from the definitions of the survival probability for a Poisson process with a time-dependent hazard and the change-of-variables between time $t$ and force $F$ under constant loading, derive the rupture-force probability density $p(F)$ under this constant loading-rate experiment.\n\nThen specialize to the Bell slip-bond model of force-dependent off-rate, $k(F) = k_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$, where $k_{0}$ is the zero-force off-rate, $x_{b} > 0$ is the distance to the transition state along the force coordinate, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.

            "solution": "**Part 1: General Rupture-Force Probability Density**\n\nLet $S(t)$ be the survival probability, the probability that the bond has not ruptured by time $t$. For a process with a time-dependent rupture rate $k(t')$, this is:\n$$\nS(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} k(t') \\, dt'\\right)\n$$\nThe probability density function for rupture time, $p_t(t)$, is the negative derivative of the survival probability:\n$$\np_t(t) = -\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = k(t) \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t} k(t') \\, dt'\\right) = k(t) S(t)\n$$\nWe need to change variables from time $t$ to force $F$. Given the constant loading rate $r$, we have $F = rt$, so $t = F/r$ and $dt = dF/r$. Probability conservation requires $p(F)dF = p_t(t)dt$, which gives $p(F) = p_t(t(F)) \\frac{dt}{dF} = p_t(F/r) \\cdot \\frac{1}{r}$.\nTo express the integral in terms of force, we also change the integration variable: $t' = F'/r$, $dt' = dF'/r$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t=F/r} k(t') \\, dt' = \\frac{1}{r}\\int_{0}^{F} k(F') \\, dF'\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get the survival probability as a function of force:\n$$\nS(F) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\int_{0}^{F} k(F') \\, dF'\\right)\n$$\nFinally, the rupture-force probability density $p(F)$ is:\n$$\np(F) = \\frac{k(F)}{r} S(F) = \\frac{k(F)}{r} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{r}\\int_{0}^{F} k(F') \\, dF'\\right)\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Most Probable Rupture Force for the Bell Model**\n\nFor the Bell model, $k(F) = k_{0}\\exp\\left(\\frac{F x_{b}}{k_{B} T}\\right)$.

This gives the stationarity condition:\n$$\n\\frac{k'(F)}{k(F)} - \\frac{k(F)}{r} = 0 \\implies rk'(F) = [k(F)]^2\n$$\nwhere $k'(F) = -a_c k_c \\exp(-a_c F) + a_s k_s \\exp(a_s F)$.\n\nFor the rupture-force distribution to be bimodal, there must be two local maxima. This can occur under the following qualitative conditions:\n1.  **Catch-bond character**: The rate $k(F)$ must first decrease (catch) and then increase (slip), creating a local minimum. This happens if the zero-force contribution of the catch pathway is stronger than the slip pathway, i.e., $a_c k_c > a_s k_s$.\n2.  **Intermediate loading rate**: The loading rate $r$ must be in a specific range. If $r$ is very slow, the bond will rupture in the low-force catch regime, giving a single peak. If $r$ is very fast, the force increases so quickly that rupture is forced into the high-force slip regime, also giving a single peak. For an intermediate loading rate, there is a significant probability of rupture in both force regimes, allowing for two distinct peaks in the distribution $p(F)$. This corresponds to the stationarity equation $r k'(F) = [k(F)]^2$ having two solutions that correspond to local maxima.",

The coordinate $x=0$ is at the clamped base and $x=L$ is at the free tip.\n\nFor a cantilever beam with a lateral force $F$ applied at the tip ($x=L$), the bending moment at any position $x$ is found by considering the equilibrium of the segment from $x$ to $L$.
