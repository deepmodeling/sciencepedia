            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. The physical parameters provided for cortical bone are realistic and within the range reported in biomechanics literature. The assumptions of linear elasticity, small-scale yielding, and local isotropy are standard for an introductory LEFM analysis and are explicitly stated.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, to derive the general form of the mode I stress intensity factor, and second, to calculate a specific critical crack length.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Stress Intensity Factor Form**\n\nThe stress intensity factor, $K_I$, is a parameter in LEFM that quantifies the magnitude of the stress field singularity at the tip of a crack subjected to mode I (opening) loading. The near-tip stress components, $\\sigma_{ij}$, in a linear elastic body have the asymptotic form:\n$$\n\\sigma_{ij}(r, \\theta) = \\frac{K_I}{\\sqrt{2\\pi r}} f_{ij}(\\theta) + \\text{higher order terms}\n$$\nwhere $r$ is the radial distance from the crack tip and $\\theta$ is the angle relative to the crack plane.\n\nFrom this relationship, we can determine the physical dimensions of $K_I$.\n- The dimensions of stress, $\\sigma_{ij}$, are force per unit area, $[\\sigma] = \\frac{F}{L^2}$.\n- The dimensions of distance, $r$, are length, $[r] = L$.\n- The term $\\sqrt{2\\pi}$ and the angular function $f_{ij}(\\theta)$ are dimensionless.\n\nThus, the dimensions of $K_I$ must be:\n$$\n[K_I] = [\\sigma] \\cdot [r]^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{F}{L^2}\\right) \\cdot L^{1/2} = F L^{-3/2}\n$$\nCommon units for $K_I$ are $\\mathrm{Pa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$ or, as given in the problem, $\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\nTo derive the dependence of $K_I$ on the problem's physical parameters using dimensional arguments, we identify the relevant quantities:\n1. The remote applied normal stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$, which drives the crack opening. $[\\sigma_{\\max}] = F L^{-2}$.\n2. The characteristic size of the crack, its length $a$. $[a] = L$.\n\nWe seek a combination of $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and $a$ that produces the dimensions of $K_I$. Let us propose a relationship of the form:\n$$\nK_I \\propto \\sigma_{\\max}^{x} a^{y}\n$$\nwhere $x$ and $y$ are exponents to be determined. The dimensions of this expression are:\n$$\n[\\sigma_{\\max}^{x} a^{y}] = (F L^{-2})^x (L)^y = F^x L^{y-2x}\n$$\nTo match the dimensions of $K_I$ ($F^1 L^{-3/2}$), we must equate the exponents for the base dimensions of force ($F$) and length ($L$):\n- For $F$: $x = 1$.\n- For $L$: $y - 2x = -3/2$.\n\nSubstituting $x=1$ into the second equation gives:\n$$\ny - 2(1) = -3/2 \\implies y = 2 - 3/2 = 1/2\n$$\nTherefore, the dimensional analysis reveals that $K_I$ must be proportional to $\\sigma_{\\max}^{1} a^{1/2}$, or $\\sigma_{\\max} \\sqrt{a}$.\n\nThe full expression for the stress intensity factor includes a dimensionless geometry correction factor, $Y$, which accounts for the specific geometry of the cracked body and the loading configuration. The relationship is written as:\n$$\nK_I = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{a}\n$$\nBy convention in fracture mechanics, a factor of $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is often explicitly included in the definition, such that:\n$$\nK_I = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\nIn this formulation, $Y$ is a dimensionless function of the ratio of crack length to other characteristic dimensions of the body (e.g., $a/W$ for a plate of width $W$). For the specific case of a single through-thickness edge crack in a \"wide plate\" (which can be modeled as a semi-infinite plate, where $a/W \\to 0$), the geometry factor $Y$ approaches a constant value. The value $Y=1.12$ provided in the problem statement corresponds to this conventional definition.\n\nFor the given problem under cyclic loading, fracture is governed by the maximum stress intensity factor, $K_{\\max}$, which occurs at the maximum applied stress, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. Thus, the final derived dependence is:\n$$\nK_{\\max} = Y \\sigma_{\\max} \\sqrt{\\pi a}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Critical Crack Length ($a_c$)**\n\nThe fracture criterion is stated as the initiation of fracture when the maximum stress intensity factor equals the plane-strain fracture toughness of the material, $K_{IC}$. The critical crack length, $a_c$, is the length at which this condition is met.\n$$\nK_{\\max} = K_{IC}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $K_{\\max}$:\n$$\nY \\sigma_{\\max} \\sqrt{\\pi a_c} = K_{IC}\n$$\nWe can now solve for $a_c$. First, we isolate the square root term:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\pi a_c} = \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma_{\\max}}\n$$\nNext, we square both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\pi a_c = \\left( \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma_{\\max}} \\right)^2\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $a_c$:\n$$\na_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{K_{IC}}{Y \\sigma_{\\max}} \\right)^2\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $K_{IC} = 3~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}$\n- $Y = 1.12$\n- $\\sigma_{\\max} = 50~\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\n$$\na_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3~\\mathrm{MPa}\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}}}{1.12 \\times 50~\\mathrm{MPa}} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe units of $\\mathrm{MPa}$ in the numerator and denominator cancel, leaving units of $(\\sqrt{\\mathrm{m}})^2 = \\mathrm{m}$, as expected for a length.\n$$\na_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{3}{56} \\right)^2 \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\na_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left( 0.0535714... \\right)^2 \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\na_c = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (0.0028699...) \\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\na_c \\approx 0.000913533~\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in millimeters and rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\na_c = 0.000913533~\\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1000~\\mathrm{mm}}{1~\\mathrm{m}} = 0.913533~\\mathrm{mm}\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get:\n$$\na_c \\approx 0.9135~\\mathrm{mm}\n$$",

            "problem": "A cortical bone specimen is subjected to constant-amplitude axial cyclic loading under fixed stress ratio and environmental conditions such that time-dependent remodeling is negligible over the test duration, and failure is governed by microdamage accumulation to a critical damage threshold. Empirical observations for high-cycle fatigue in mineralized tissues under these conditions often exhibit scale-invariant behavior, implying that the cycles-to-failure $N$ depend on the stress amplitude $S_a$ through a power-law relation characterized by a dimensionless exponent (the Basquin slope) and a prefactor constant.

Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n-   **Scientific Grounding**: The problem is grounded in the established field of biomechanics, specifically the fatigue mechanics of bone. The concept of microdamage accumulation as the driver of fatigue failure is a central tenet of modern damage mechanics. The use of a power-law relationship (Basquin's law) to model the high-cycle fatigue S-N curve is a standard and empirically validated approach for many materials, including bone.

Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n**2.1. Derivation of the Power-Law Relationship**\nWe begin from the first principle that fatigue failure is due to the accumulation of microdamage. Let $D$ represent a normalized measure of damage, such that $D=0$ corresponds to the initial, undamaged state and $D=1$ corresponds to failure.\n\nThe rate of damage accumulation per loading cycle, $\\frac{dD}{dN}$, is a function of the applied stress state, which for this problem is characterized by the stress amplitude $S_a$. The problem's mention of \"scale-invariant behavior\" strongly implies that this functional relationship is a power law. We posit the simplest such relationship, where the damage rate is proportional to a power of the stress amplitude:\n$$\n\\frac{dD}{dN} = K S_a^m\n$$\nHere, $K$ is a material-dependent proportionality constant and $m$ is a dimensionless exponent, both assumed to be positive. This equation models damage as accumulating at a constant rate for a given constant stress amplitude $S_a$.\n\nTo find the number of cycles to failure, $N_f$, we integrate this differential equation from the initial condition ($N=0, D=0$) to the failure condition ($N=N_f, D=1$):\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{1} dD = \\int_{0}^{N_f} K S_a^m dN\n$$\nSince $S_a$ is constant throughout the test, the term $K S_a^m$ is a constant with respect to the number of cycles $N$. The integration yields:\n$$\n[D]_{0}^{1} = K S_a^m [N]_{0}^{N_f}\n$$\n$$\n1 - 0 = K S_a^m (N_f - 0)\n$$\n$$\n1 = K S_a^m N_f\n$$\nRearranging this equation to express the relationship between stress amplitude and cycles to failure, and using the variable names from the problem statement ($N$ for $N_f$, and defining a new exponent $b=m$ and constant $C=1/K$):\n$$\nN_f = \\frac{1}{K} S_a^{-m} \\implies N = C S_a^{-b}\n$$\nThis is the power-law relationship. It can be rewritten in the form suggested by the problem's required units for the constant $C$. The units of $C$ are given as cycles$\\cdot\\mathrm{MPa}^{b}$. For the equation $N = C S_a^{-b}$, the units would be $[C] = [N] / [S_a]^{-b} = \\text{cycles} / (\\text{MPa})^{-b} = \\text{cycles} \\cdot \\text{MPa}^{b}$. This matches the requirement. Therefore, the governing equation is:\n$$\nN S_a^b = C\n$$\nThis form is consistent with a first-principles damage accumulation model under the assumption of scale invariance.\n\n**2.2. Fitting Parameters $b$ and $C$**\nWe have two data points that must satisfy the derived equation:\n1.  For $(S_{a1}, N_1) = (45\\,\\mathrm{MPa}, 3 \\times 10^5)$:\n    $$ (3 \\times 10^5) (45)^b = C $$\n2.  For $(S_{a2}, N_2) = (30\\,\\mathrm{MPa}, 2 \\times 10^6)$:\n    $$ (2 \\times 10^6) (30)^b = C $$\n\nSince both left-hand sides equal $C$, we can set them equal to each other to solve for $b$:\n$$\n(3 \\times 10^5) (45)^b = (2 \\times 10^6) (30)^b\n$$\nWe group terms with the exponent $b$ on one side and the numerical constants on the other:\n$$\n\\frac{(45)^b}{(30)^b} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^6}{3 \\times 10^5}\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{45}{30}\\right)^b = \\frac{20 \\times 10^5}{3 \\times 10^5} = \\frac{20}{3}\n$$\n$$\n(1.5)^b = \\frac{20}{3}\n$$\nTo solve for $b$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left((1.5)^b\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nb \\ln(1.5) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{20}{3}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nb = \\frac{\\ln(20/3)}{\\ln(1.5)} \\approx \\frac{1.8971199}{0.4054651} \\approx 4.678906\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\nb \\approx 4.68\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this value of $b$ back into either of the initial equations to find $C$.

This relationship links the rate of density change to the difference between the applied mechanical stimulus, $U$, and the homeostatic set-point for that stimulus, $U_0$.

We must therefore perform a unit conversion for the density term, $\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$, to $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\nWe use the following conversion factors:\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{g} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which implies $1\\,\\mathrm{cm^3} = (10^{-2})^3\\,\\mathrm{m^3} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}$\n\nCombining these, we find the conversion factor for density:\n$$ \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{g}}{1\\,\\mathrm{cm^3}} = \\frac{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3}} = 10^3\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{kg}}{\\mathrm{m^3}} $$\nSo, to convert from $\\mathrm{g/cm^3}$ to $\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$, we multiply by $1000$.\n\nApplying this conversion to our calculated value of $\\dot{\\rho}$:\n$$ \\dot{\\rho} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{g}{cm^3\\cdot day}} \\times \\left( \\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}}{1\\,\\mathrm{g/cm^3}} \\right) $$\n$$ \\dot{\\rho} = 0.01 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{kg}{m^3\\cdot day}} $$\n$$ \\dot{\\rho} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\frac{kg}{m^3\\cdot day}} $$\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the final answer should be rounded to three significant figures.
