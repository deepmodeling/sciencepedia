            "introduction": "Understanding the mobility of a limb is the first step in analyzing its kinematic capabilities. This exercise provides foundational practice in applying the principle that the total degrees of freedom (DOF) of an open kinematic chain are the sum of the DOFs of its individual joints . By modeling the human arm as a series of ideal joints, you will calculate its mobility and connect this abstract number to the set of movements required for a functional task like reaching.",

            "problem": "Consider an open serial-chain kinematic model of a human limb comprising three ideal anatomical joints in series: a proximal spherical joint connecting the trunk to the humerus, a revolute joint connecting the humerus to the forearm, and a revolute joint connecting the forearm to the hand. The spherical joint is modeled as allowing three independent rotations about anatomical axes (flexion–extension, abduction–adduction, and internal–external rotation), each revolute joint allows a single independent rotation about its anatomical axis (elbow flexion–extension and forearm pronation–supination, respectively). The trunk is fixed in space, scapulothoracic motion is excluded, and there are no soft-tissue couplings or articular constraints that reduce independence of the stated joint motions. All joint axes are non-parallel and non-collinear in a way that preserves independence of their generalized coordinates.\n\nUsing the fundamental definition that the mobility $M$ of an open serial-chain mechanism with a fixed base equals the dimension of its configuration space, in turn equal to the number of independent generalized coordinates needed to specify its configuration, compute the mobility $M$ of this limb model from its anatomical joint types and their degrees of freedom (degrees of freedom (DOF) per joint are taken as $3$ for a spherical joint and $1$ for a revolute joint). Then, verify whether this $M$ matches the minimal osteokinematic set needed to independently control shoulder flexion–extension, shoulder abduction–adduction, shoulder internal–external rotation, elbow flexion–extension, and forearm pronation–supination in three-dimensional reaching with the hand, under the modeling assumptions stated. Express the mobility $M$ as a dimensionless integer. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The mobility $M$ of a multibody system is defined as the dimension of its configuration manifold, which equals the number of independent generalized coordinates required to uniquely specify the configuration of the system. For an open serial kinematic chain with a fixed base, and under the assumptions that each joint contributes independent coordinates with no redundant constraints, the total mobility is the sum of the degrees of freedom (DOF) of the individual joints. If joint $i$ contributes $f_{i}$ independent coordinates, then the total mobility is\n$$\nM = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} f_{i},\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of joints in the chain.\n\nIn the limb model described, there are $n=3$ joints:\n- Joint 1 is spherical with $f_{1} = 3$ rotational DOF (three independent rotations).\n- Joint 2 is revolute with $f_{2} = 1$ rotational DOF (single-axis flexion–extension at the elbow).\n- Joint 3 is revolute with $f_{3} = 1$ rotational DOF (single-axis pronation–supination of the forearm).\n\nTherefore, by summing the independent contributions, the mobility is:\n$$\nM = f_{1} + f_{2} + f_{3} = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n$$\n\nVerification: The problem asks to verify if this mobility matches the minimal set of independent motions needed for 3D reaching, which are listed as shoulder flexion–extension, shoulder abduction–adduction, shoulder internal–external rotation, elbow flexion–extension, and forearm pronation–supination. This is a set of five independent motions.\n- The spherical joint at the shoulder provides the three independent shoulder motions.\n- The first revolute joint provides the elbow flexion–extension.\n- The second revolute joint provides the forearm pronation–supination.\n\nSince the model provides exactly 5 independent degrees of freedom, and the task requires 5 independent motions, the computed mobility $M = 5$ matches the functional requirement.",

            "introduction": "While summing joint freedoms is a practical shortcut, a deeper understanding comes from deriving this rule from first principles. This practice challenges you to derive the mobility formula for an open chain from the more general Kutzbach-Grübler criterion, reinforcing the relationship between links, joints, and constraints . Applying this to a lower limb model introduces the critical concept of kinematic redundancy, prompting you to consider whether the limb has more degrees of freedom than necessary to perform a given task, a central question in the study of motor control.",

            "problem": "A lower-limb kinematic chain is modeled using joint classification and terminology common in biomechanics. Consider an open serial chain comprising the pelvis–hip joint (spherical), knee joint (modified hinge), ankle joint (hinge), and subtalar joint (hinge). Let the number of links, including the ground (pelvis) link, be $N=5$. The spherical joint has $f=3$ degrees of freedom (DOF), each hinge joint has $f=1$ DOF, and the modified hinge joint can be treated as $f\\approx 1$ for mobility classification. Using only foundational principles that (i) each unconstrained rigid body in three-dimensional space possesses $6$ DOF and (ii) each joint imposes constraints equal to the difference between $6$ and the joint’s remaining relative DOF, derive a general expression for the mobility $M$ of a three-dimensional open serial chain in terms of $N$ and the set of joint DOF $\\{f_i\\}$. Then apply your expression to the described chain to compute the numerical value of $M$. Report $M$ as a unitless number. Finally, interpret the derived $M$ in the context of gait, specifically commenting on whether the open-chain limb during swing is kinematically redundant for placing the foot in an arbitrary spatial pose relative to the pelvis. No rounding is required for the final numerical answer.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for three things: a derivation of the mobility formula for an open serial chain, calculation of the mobility for the given lower-limb model, and an interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the General Mobility Expression**\n\nLet us consider a general open serial chain in three-dimensional space with $N$ links. One link is the fixed base, leaving $N-1$ moving links. If these links were unconstrained, they would collectively have $6(N-1)$ degrees of freedom (DOF), as each rigid body has 6 DOF in space.\n\nThe links are connected by $J = N-1$ joints. Each joint $i$ with $f_i$ degrees of freedom imposes a number of constraints, $c_i$, on the relative motion between the two links it connects. The number of constraints is the number of motions it prevents out of the 6 possible relative motions: $c_i = 6 - f_i$.\n\nThe total mobility $M$ of the chain is the total potential DOF minus the total constraints imposed by all joints:\n$$M = 6(N-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^{J} c_i$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $J$ and $c_i$:\n$$M = 6(N-1) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} (6 - f_i)$$\nExpanding the summation:\n$$M = 6(N-1) - \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 6 - \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i \\right)$$\nThe term $\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} 6$ is equal to $6(N-1)$.\n$$M = 6(N-1) - 6(N-1) + \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i$$\nThis simplifies to the general expression for the mobility of a three-dimensional open serial chain:\n$$M = \\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} f_i$$\nThis result shows that the mobility of an open serial chain is simply the sum of the degrees of freedom of its individual joints.\n\n**Part 2: Application to the Lower-Limb Chain**\n\nThe lower-limb model has $N=5$ links and $N-1=4$ joints with the following DOFs:\n- Hip joint (spherical): $f_1 = 3$\n- Knee joint (modified hinge): $f_2 = 1$\n- Ankle joint (hinge): $f_3 = 1$\n- Subtalar joint (hinge): $f_4 = 1$\n\nUsing the derived formula, the mobility $M$ of this chain is:\n$$M = f_1 + f_2 + f_3 + f_4 = 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6$$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation**\n\nThe task is to place the foot in an arbitrary spatial pose (position and orientation) relative to the pelvis. A complete description of a rigid body's pose in 3D space requires 6 independent parameters: 3 for position ($x, y, z$) and 3 for orientation (e.g., roll, pitch, yaw). Thus, the task has 6 degrees of freedom.\n\nOur calculation shows that the limb model has a mobility of $M=6$. Since the number of available DOFs ($M=6$) is equal to the number of DOFs required by the task ($6$), the limb is **not kinematically redundant** for this task. It has precisely the number of DOFs needed to control the foot's pose, implying that for a given desired pose, there is a unique (or a finite set of) joint configuration(s) that can achieve it.",

            "introduction": "Ideal joint models provide a necessary simplification, but real biological joints exhibit complex behaviors that defy simple classification. This exercise simulates the process of experimental joint characterization, where you must interpret quantitative data on motion coupling and range of motion to determine a joint's true nature .

            "problem": "An unknown cadaveric synovial joint is mounted in a six-degree-of-freedom robotic rig. Translations are actively minimized so that rotation-dominant behavior can be characterized under quasistatic loading. The joint is tested by applying near-neutral, ramped pure moments about anatomical axes aligned with flexion–extension ($x$), abduction–adduction ($y$), and axial rotation ($z$). For each axis $i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}$, a pure moment $M_i$ up to $M_{\\max} = 5\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$ is applied while keeping $M_{j \\neq i} \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$. Primary and secondary rotations are recorded at the end of the ramp, defined respectively as rotation about the loaded axis and the off-axis rotations about the other two axes.\n\nNear neutral, small-signal rotational compliance is estimated by linearizing the moment–rotation map as $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\approx C\\,\\boldsymbol{M}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\theta_x,\\theta_y,\\theta_z]^\\top$ (radians) and $\\boldsymbol{M} = [M_x,M_y,M_z]^\\top$ ($\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$).

Ball-and-socket, because the large ROM about all three axes and near-diagonal rotational compliance indicate $3$ independent rotational DOF with negligible coupling.\n\nB. Condyloid, because axial rotation is limited at neutral and predominantly emerges as conjunct rotation coupled with flexion–extension and abduction–adduction, indicating $2$ independent rotational DOF with constrained spin.\n\nC. Ball-and-socket, because the sum of the three end-range rotations exceeds $150^\\circ$, which necessarily implies $3$ rotational DOF.\n\nD. Condyloid, because it possesses $2$ rotational DOF and $1$ translational DOF, as evidenced by nonzero off-axis rotations under pure axial moment.",
            "solution": "To determine the most appropriate classification, we must analyze the experimental data in the context of the provided definitions for ball-and-socket (3 independent rotational DOF) and condyloid (2 independent rotational DOF with constrained spin) joints. The key is to assess the independence of the three rotational motions.\n\n1.  **Analyze Range of Motion (ROM):** The joint shows a large ROM in flexion-extension ($110^\\circ$) and a substantial ROM in abduction-adduction ($50^\\circ$). However, the primary axial rotation ROM at neutral is very limited ($14^\\circ$). This large disparity suggests that motion is not equally free in all three directions, which would be typical of a ball-and-socket joint. This evidence points away from a 3-DOF classification.\n\n2.  **Analyze Motion Coupling:** A critical test for independence is whether applying a moment about one axis produces rotation primarily about that same axis. When a pure axial moment ($M_z$) was applied, it produced a primary axial rotation of only $14^\\circ$ but also a large secondary flexion of $18^\\circ$. The fact that the secondary rotation is larger than the primary rotation is a strong indication that axial rotation and flexion are not independent motions. The joint cannot be purely axially rotated by applying a pure axial moment. This contradicts the definition of a 3-DOF joint.\n\n3.  **Analyze Conjunct Rotation:** The most definitive evidence comes from testing axial rotation at a flexed position. At neutral, a $5\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$ axial moment produced $14^\\circ$ of rotation. When the joint was first flexed to $60^\\circ$, the same moment produced a much larger axial rotation of $38^\\circ$. This demonstrates that the joint's capacity for axial rotation is dependent on its position in flexion. This phenomenon—where motion about one axis is unlocked or significantly altered by the position on another axis—is the definition of **conjunct rotation**. This behavior is the classic hallmark of a condyloid joint, where the constrained axial spin becomes available as it is coupled to the primary motions of flexion/extension.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A is incorrect.** ROM is not large about all three axes, and the coupling is significant, not negligible.\n*   **B is correct.** It accurately summarizes the key findings: axial rotation is limited, and it manifests as conjunct rotation coupled with flexion. This perfectly describes a condyloid joint with 2 independent DOF and a constrained spin.\n*   **C is incorrect.** The total sum of ROMs is not a valid criterion for determining the number of independent DOFs.\n*   **D is incorrect.** The justification is flawed. The experiment was designed to minimize translation, so there is no evidence for a translational DOF. The off-axis rotations are evidence of *rotational* coupling, not translation.\n\nBased on the limited axial ROM at neutral, the strong coupling between axial rotation and flexion, and the clear demonstration of conjunct rotation, the joint behaves as a 2-DOF system with constrained spin. Therefore, it is best classified as condyloid.",
