            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the total elastic strain energy stored in a ligament, modeled as a parallel bundle of three collagen fibers, for a given joint rotation. The solution proceeds in three main stages: first, deriving a general expression for the strain energy in a single fiber; second, calculating the specific energy stored in each of the three fibers at the specified joint rotation; and third, summing these energies to find the total joint energy.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that for a quasi-static, conservative system, the elastic strain energy $U$ stored in a deformable body is equal to the work $W$ done by the applied force $F$ during its extension $\\Delta L$. Starting from a slack state (zero force, zero extension), the energy stored at an extension $\\Delta L$ is given by the integral of the force with respect to the extension:\n$$U(\\Delta L) = \\int_0^{\\Delta L} F(x) \\, dx$$\n\nFor each fiber $i$, the force-extension relationship $F_i(\\Delta L_i)$ is given piecewise:\n- Toe region ($0 \\leq \\Delta L_i \\leq \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}$): $F_i(\\Delta L_i) = a_i \\Delta L_i^{2}$\n- Linear region ($\\Delta L_i \\geq \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}$): $F_i(\\Delta L_i) = k_i \\Delta L_i + d_i$\n\nThe problem states that $F_i(\\Delta L_i)$ must be continuously differentiable at the transition point $\\Delta L_i = \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}$. This imposes two conditions:\n1.  Continuity of force: The force values from both regions must be equal at $\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}$.\n    $$a_i \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}^{2} = k_i \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i} + d_i$$\n2.  Continuity of the derivative (stiffness): The derivatives of the force with respect to extension must be equal at $\\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i}$. The derivative in the toe region is $\\frac{dF_i}{d(\\Delta L_i)} = 2a_i \\Delta L_i$. The derivative in the linear region is $\\frac{dF_i}{d(\\Delta L_i)} = k_i$.\n    $$2 a_i \\Delta L_{\\mathrm{t},i} = k_i$$\n\nWe can use these two conditions to solve for the parameters of the linear region, $k_i$ and $d_i$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the equilibrium joint angle shift, denoted as $\\Delta \\theta_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, for a planar hinge joint stabilized by two antagonistic ligaments with asymmetric prestrain. The derivation must start from the first principles of linear elasticity and energy minimization.\n\nFirst, we establish the total potential energy of the system. The system consists of two ligaments, each modeled as a linear elastic spring.

We are given $s_1 = +1$ and $s_2 = -1$.\n\nSubstituting the given values for $s_1$ and $s_2$ into the expression for $\\Delta \\ell_i(\\theta)$, we get the specific extensions for ligament $1$ and ligament $2$:\nFor ligament $1$:\n$$\\Delta \\ell_1(\\theta) = \\epsilon_1 L_{01} + (1) r_1 \\theta = \\epsilon_1 L_{01} + r_1 \\theta$$\nFor ligament $2$:\n$$\\Delta \\ell_2(\\theta) = \\epsilon_2 L_{02} + (-1) r_2 \\theta = \\epsilon_2 L_{02} - r_2 \\theta$$\n\nNow we can write the total potential energy $U_{total}(\\theta)$ explicitly in terms of $\\theta$ and the given parameters:\n$$U_{total}(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} k_1 (\\epsilon_1 L_{01} + r_1 \\theta)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} k_2 (\\epsilon_2 L_{02} - r_2 \\theta)^2$$\n\nAccording to the principle of minimum potential energy, a conservative mechanical system is in stable equilibrium when its total potential energy is at a local minimum with respect to the generalized coordinates.

We apply the product rule for differentiation:\n$$S(\\theta) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} [k (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l'(\\theta)]$$\n$$S(\\theta) = k \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}(l(\\theta) - l_{0})\\right) l'(\\theta) + (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) \\left(\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}l'(\\theta)\\right) \\right]$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial l_{0}}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$, this simplifies to:\n$$S(\\theta) = k [l'(\\theta) \\cdot l'(\\theta) + (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l''(\\theta)]$$\n$$S(\\theta) = k [(l'(\\theta))^{2} + (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l''(\\theta)]$$\n\nNow, we must find the sensitivity of the stability metric to the slack length, which is the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial l_{0}}$. The functions $l(\\theta)$, $l'(\\theta)$, and $l''(\\theta)$ do not depend on the parameter $l_{0}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial S(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_{0}} \\left( k [(l'(\\theta))^{2} + (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l''(\\theta)] \\right)$$\nWe can distribute the partial derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}} = k \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_{0}}((l'(\\theta))^{2}) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_{0}}((l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l''(\\theta)) \\right]$$\nThe first term, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_{0}}((l'(\\theta))^{2})$, is zero because $l'(\\theta)$ is not a function of $l_{0}$. For the second term, we apply the product rule with respect to $l_0$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial l_{0}}((l(\\theta) - l_{0}) l''(\\theta)) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial(l(\\theta) - l_{0})}{\\partial l_{0}}\\right) l''(\\theta) + (l(\\theta) - l_{0}) \\left(\\frac{\\partial l''(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}}\\right)$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{\\partial(l(\\theta) - l_{0})}{\\partial l_{0}}$ is $-1$. The derivative $\\frac{\\partial l''(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}}$ is zero. Thus, the expression simplifies to $-l''(\\theta)$.\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the sensitivity:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}} = k [0 - l''(\\theta)] = -k l''(\\theta)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $l''(\\theta) = -m \\cos(\\theta - \\beta)$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial S(\\theta)}{\\partial l_{0}} = -k (-m \\cos(\\theta - \\beta)) = km \\cos(\\theta - \\beta)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the sensitivity. The problem requires this to be evaluated at the operating angle $\\theta_{0}$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial l_{0}}\\right|_{\\theta_{0}} = km \\cos(\\theta_{0} - \\beta)$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$k = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}$ N/m\n$m = 1.2 \\times 10^{-2}$ m\n$\\theta_{0} = \\frac{\\pi}{12}$\n$\\beta = \\frac{\\pi}{9}$\n\nFirst, calculate the argument of the cosine function:\n$$\\theta_{0} - \\beta = \\frac{\\pi}{12} - \\frac{\\pi}{9} = \\frac{3\\pi}{36} - \\frac{4\\pi}{36} = -\\frac{\\pi}{36}$$\nThe cosine function is even, so $\\cos(-\\frac{\\pi}{36}) = \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{36})$.\nThe numerical value of the sensitivity is:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial l_{0}}\\right|_{\\theta_{0}} = (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (1.2 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{36}\\right)$$\n$$(3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (1.2 \\times 10^{-2}) = 3.6 \\times 10^{2} = 360$$\nSo, the expression becomes:\n$$360 \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{36}\\right)$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{36}\\right) \\approx 0.996194698$$\n$$360 \\times 0.996194698 \\approx 358.6300913$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$358.6$$\nThe units of the result are $[k][m] = (\\text{N}/\\text{m}) \\cdot \\text{m} = \\text{N}$, which is consistent with the problem's request.",
