Many muscles in the body, such as the gastrocnemius, feature fibers that are arranged at an angle to the muscle's line of action—a design known as pennation. This fundamental practice  challenges you to derive the core geometric relationships that link the overall musculotendon length to the length and orientation of the individual muscle fibers, a crucial first step toward building and interpreting more comprehensive Hill-type models.",

            "problem": "A Hill-type musculotendon unit is modeled with pennated muscle fibers inserting between two parallel, inextensible aponeuroses. Let the musculotendon length be $l_{m}$, the free tendon length be $l_{t}$, the fascicle (fiber) length be $l_{f}$, and the pennation angle be $\\alpha$ (defined between the fiber axis and the line of action of the tendon). Under the standard geometric assumptions for this model: (i) the projection of the fiber along the line of action adds in series with the tendon, so $l_{m} = l_{t} + l_{f}\\cos\\alpha$, and (ii) the perpendicular distance between the aponeuroses is constant and equal to $w$, so the fiber thickness constraint is $w = l_{f}\\sin\\alpha$. Assume $l_{m} > l_{t} \\geq 0$ and $w > 0$, so that $0 < \\alpha < \\pi/2$.\n\nStarting from these constraints and from elementary geometric definitions of sine, cosine, and the Pythagorean theorem, derive closed-form expressions for $l_{f}$ and $\\alpha$ in terms of $l_{m}$, $l_{t}$, and $w$. Express the angle $\\alpha$ in radians. Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression that simultaneously reports $l_{f}$ and $\\alpha$ in a single row matrix, in the order $\\left(l_{f},\\ \\alpha\\right)$.
