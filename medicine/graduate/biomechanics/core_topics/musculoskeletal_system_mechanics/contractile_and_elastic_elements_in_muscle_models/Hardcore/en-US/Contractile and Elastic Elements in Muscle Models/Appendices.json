The CE produces active force in response to neural activation, the PEE captures passive muscle fiber elasticity, and the SEE captures tendon/aponeurosis elasticity. Assume quasi-static conditions (no velocity effects), and neglect damping. Let the total MTU length be $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$, the SEE length be $l_{s}$ with slack length $l_{s0}$ and stiffness $k_{s}$, and the CE/PEE (fiber) length be $l_{m}$ with PEE slack length $l_{p0}$ and stiffness $k_{p}$. The parallel elements share the same length, so the CE and PEE both have length $l_{m}$. The SEE and the parallel pair are in series, so $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$. The SEE and PEE are linear elastic springs that develop force only when stretched beyond slack, modeled as $F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = k_{s}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{s}-l_{s0})$ and $F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = k_{p}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{m}-l_{p0})$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a three-element Hill-type muscle-tendon unit (MTU) under quasi-static conditions with zero neural activation. The model consists of a Contractile Element (CE) and a Parallel Elastic Element (PEE) arranged in parallel, with this pair connected in series with a Series Elastic Element (SEE). At zero activation, the active force from the CE is zero, $F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$. The analysis proceeds based on static equilibrium and length compatibility.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  Length Compatibility: The total length of the MTU is the sum of the lengths of the series components. The parallel component, comprising the CE and PEE, has a length $l_{m}$, and the series component has a length $l_{s}$.\n    $$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$$\n2.  Static Equilibrium: In a series arrangement, the force is the same throughout. The total force in the MTU, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$, is equal to the force in the SEE, $F_{\\mathrm{SEE}}$, which is in turn equal to the total force from the parallel muscle fiber branch, $F_{m}$.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{m}$$\n    The force in the parallel branch, $F_{m}$, is the sum of the forces from the elements in parallel, the CE and the PEE.\n    $$F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$$\n3.  Constitutive Laws for Passive Elements: The passive forces are given by linear spring models.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = k_{s}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{s}-l_{s0})$$\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = k_{p}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{m}-l_{p0})$$\n4.  Zero Activation Condition: The active force produced by the CE is zero.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$$\n\nCombining the equilibrium and activation conditions, we find the relationship between the passive forces:\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = 0 + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$.\nThus, for the MTU to have any passive tension, the force in the SEE must be equal to the force in the PEE:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$$\n\nWe now address the three parts of the problem.\n\n1) Explanation of the PEE's role at zero activation:\nIn a hypothetical MTU containing only a CE in series with an SEE, the total force is $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. At zero activation, $F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$, which means the entire MTU can produce no force, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = 0$, regardless of its length $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$. The MTU would be completely slack and unable to resist any external load.\n\nIn the specified three-element model, the PEE is in parallel with the CE. The total force from this parallel fiber unit is $F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. At zero activation ($F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$), this becomes $F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. Due to the series connection with the SEE, equilibrium requires $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{m}$. Therefore, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. This shows that the PEE provides a pathway for force generation and transmission even when the contractile machinery is inactive.\n\nThe physical mechanism responsible is the passive elasticity of muscle tissue. The PEE models the resistance to stretching from connective tissues within and around the muscle fibers (such as the endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium) and potentially intrinsic structural proteins within the muscle cell (like titin). When the muscle is stretched ($l_{m} > l_{p0}$), these tissues behave like a spring, generating a passive force ($F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$). This internal force is transmitted through the tendon (the SEE), resulting in a measurable tension at the ends of the whole MTU, allowing it to bear an external load passively.\n\n2) Derivation of the closed-form expression for $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}})$:\nWe seek to find $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ as a function of $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ and the given parameters. A non-zero passive force, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$, can only exist if both the SEE and PEE are stretched beyond their respective slack lengths. When $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$:\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = k_{s}(l_{s} - l_{s0})$\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = k_{p}(l_{m} - l_{p0})$\n\nWe can express the component lengths, $l_s$ and $l_m$, in terms of the force $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$:\n$$l_{s} = l_{s0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{s}}$$\n$$l_{m} = l_{p0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{p}}$$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the length compatibility equation, $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = \\left(l_{s0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{s}}\\right) + \\left(l_{p0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{p}}\\right)$$\nWe can now isolate $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$. First, we group the terms:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - (l_{s0} + l_{p0}) = F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{s}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p}}\\right)$$\nTo find the common denominator for the stiffness term:\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{s}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p}} = \\frac{k_{p} + k_{s}}{k_{s}k_{p}}$$\nSubstituting this back and solving for $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ yields:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0} = F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\left(\\frac{k_{s} + k_{p}}{k_{s} k_{p}}\\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) (L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$$\nThis expression is valid only when $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$. This occurs when the term $(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$ is positive, since the effective stiffness $\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}$ is inherently positive. If $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\le l_{s0} + l_{p0}$, the MTU is not stretched enough to engage both passive elements, so the passive force is zero. This piecewise behavior can be captured compactly using the $\\max$ function:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}) = \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) \\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$$\nThis expression shows that the two passive elements in series behave as a single spring with an effective stiffness equal to the harmonic sum of the individual stiffnesses and a slack length equal to the sum of the individual slack lengths.\n\n3) Condition for nonzero load-bearing at zero activation:\nAn MTU can bear a nonzero external load at zero activation if its passive tension $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ is greater than zero. Using the expression derived in part 2):\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) \\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0}) > 0$$\nSince stiffnesses $k_{s}$ and $k_{p}$ are positive physical constants, their product and sum are also positive. The pre-factor $\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}$ is therefore strictly positive. The inequality simplifies to:\n$$\\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0}) > 0$$\nThe $\\max$ function of $0$ and a value is greater than $0$ if and only if that value itself is greater than $0$. Thus, the condition is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0} > 0$$\nOr, rewritten as:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > l_{s0} + l_{p0}$$\nThis is the condition on $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ under which the MTU can bear a nonzero external load without any active force generation. Physically, it states that the total length of the muscle-tendon unit must exceed the sum of the slack lengths of its constituent series and parallel elastic elements.",

It is a standard application of the principles of a Hill-type muscle model. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part (i): Condition for Zero Transmitted Force**\n\nThe problem asks for a condition on the total MTU length, $l_{\\text{MTU}}$, under which a change in $l_{\\text{MTU}}$ can occur with zero transmitted force, $F_{\\text{MTU}} = 0$. This phenomenon is known as \"taking up the slack\".\n\nFrom the series force equilibrium, $F_{\\text{MTU}} = F_{\\text{SEE}}$. For the transmitted force to be zero, the force in the SEE must be zero:\n$$F_{\\text{SEE}} = 0$$\nAccording to the SEE's constitutive law, this condition holds if and only if its length is less than or equal to its slack length:\n$$l_{\\text{SEE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nThe system must also satisfy the geometric constraint $l_{\\text{MTU}} = l_{\\text{CE}} + l_{\\text{SEE}}$, which can be rearranged to express the SEE length as:\n$$l_{\\text{SEE}} = l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE}}$$\nSubstituting this into the zero-force condition gives:\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied. For a given $l_{\\text{MTU}}$, this is possible if the contractile element can assume a length $l_{\\text{CE}}$ that makes the statement true. To maintain zero force as $l_{\\text{MTU}}$ changes, the CE must be able to change its length accordingly. The ability of the CE to shorten is limited by its minimum physiological length, $l_{\\text{CE,min}}$.\n$$l_{\\text{CE}} \\ge l_{\\text{CE,min}}$$\nForce will be unavoidably non-zero if, for a given $l_{\\text{MTU}}$, it is impossible to satisfy the zero-force condition $l_{\\text{SEE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$ for any permissible CE length $l_{\\text{CE}} \\ge l_{\\text{CE,min}}$.\n\nConversely, the force can be kept at zero as long as it is possible for the CE to shorten sufficiently to keep the SEE slack. The limit of this process is when the CE reaches its minimum length, $l_{\\text{CE,min}}$. At this point, the length of the SEE is $l_{\\text{SEE}} = l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE,min}}$. To maintain zero force, this SEE length must still be less than or equal to the slack length:\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE,min}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nRearranging this inequality gives the condition on $l_{\\text{MTU}}$ for which zero force can be maintained even under maximum CE shortening:\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} \\le l_{\\text{CE,min}} + l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nIf this condition holds, it is always possible to find a state $(l_{\\text{CE}}, l_{\\text{SEE}})$ with $l_{\\text{CE}} \\ge l_{\\text{CE,min}}$ and $l_{\\text{SEE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$ that satisfies the geometric constraint. Therefore, within this range of MTU lengths, the muscle can actively change its internal configuration or accommodate changes in total length without transmitting any force to the environment.\n\n**Part (ii): Calculation of the Minimal Activation Threshold ($a_{\\text{th}}$)**\n\nWe are asked to find the activation $a_{\\text{th}}$ required to hold the system in a specific quasi-static equilibrium state. The state is defined by:\n1.  MTU length: $l_{\\text{MTU}} = l_{\\text{SEE,slack}} + l_{\\text{CE,opt}} + \\delta$\n2.  CE length: $l_{\\text{CE}} = l_{\\text{CE,opt}}$\n3.  Target SEE stretch: $l_{\\text{SEE}} - l_{\\text{SEE,slack}} = \\delta$\n\nFirst, we verify the consistency of the provided state using the geometric constraint $l_{\\text{MTU}} = l_{\\text{CE}} + l_{\\text{SEE}}$. Substituting the given expressions for $l_{\\text{MTU}}$ and $l_{\\text{CE}}$:\n$$l_{\\text{SEE,slack}} + l_{\\text{CE,opt}} + \\delta = l_{\\text{CE,opt}} + l_{\\text{SEE}}$$\nSolving for $l_{\\text{SEE}}$ yields:\n$$l_{\\text{SEE}} = l_{\\text{SEE,slack}} + \\delta$$\nThis confirms that the stretch of the SEE, defined as $l_{\\text{SEE}} - l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$, is indeed $\\delta$, as required.\n\nNext, we apply the force equilibrium condition, $F_{\\text{CE}} = F_{\\text{SEE}}$. We compute each force separately.\n\nThe force in the SEE is determined by its stretch. Since $\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\text{m} > 0$, the SEE is stretched beyond its slack length ($l_{\\text{SEE}} > l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$). The force is:\n$$F_{\\text{SEE}} = k_{\\text{SEE}} (l_{\\text{SEE}} - l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}) = k_{\\text{SEE}}\\,\\delta$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$F_{\\text{SEE}} = (1.20 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}) = 60\\,\\text{N}$$\n\nThe force in the CE is given by $F_{\\text{CE}} = a_{\\text{th}}\\,F_{\\max}\\,f_{\\ell}(l_{\\text{CE}})$. The CE is held at its optimal length, $l_{\\text{CE}} = l_{\\text{CE,opt}}$. At this length, the normalized force-length factor $f_{\\ell}(l_{\\text{CE}})$ is maximal.\n$$f_{\\ell}(l_{\\text{CE,opt}}) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\left(\\frac{l_{\\text{CE,opt}} - l_{\\text{CE,opt}}}{w}\\right)^{2}\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nThus, the CE force is:\n$$F_{\\text{CE}} = a_{\\text{th}}\\,F_{\\max}\\,(1) = a_{\\text{th}}\\,F_{\\max}$$\n\nFinally, we equate the forces and solve for the unknown activation $a_{\\text{th}}$:\n$$F_{\\text{CE}} = F_{\\text{SEE}}$$\n$$a_{\\text{th}}\\,F_{\\max} = k_{\\text{SEE}}\\,\\delta$$\n$$a_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{k_{\\text{SEE}}\\,\\delta}{F_{\\max}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$a_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{60\\,\\text{N}}{1.50 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{N}} = \\frac{60}{1500} = \\frac{1}{25} = 0.04$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$a_{\\text{th}} = 0.0400$$",

The distinction between activation and deactivation time constants is a physiologically accurate feature. The given parameter values are well within the accepted physiological range for human muscle.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a well-defined initial value problem involving a piecewise-linear first-order ordinary differential equation. The initial condition is provided, and the forcing function is specified for all time. The definitions for rise and fall time are unambiguous. A unique and stable solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. All terms are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It contains no fatal flaws. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts, corresponding to the two time intervals defined by the excitation profile $u(t)$. All time constants will be converted to seconds for consistency in the derivations: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}} = 0.030\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\n**Part 1: Activation Phase and Rise Time ($0 \\le t  t_d$)**\n\nFor the interval $0 \\le t  t_d$, the neural excitation is constant at $u(t) = u_1 = 0.8$. The initial condition is $a(0) = 0$. Since $u(t) = 0.8$ and $a(t)$ starts at $0$ and will approach $0.8$ from below, the condition $u(t) \\ge a(t)$ holds for this entire interval. Thus, the time constant is $\\tau(u,a) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\n\nThe differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{u_1 - a(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which can be rearranged to the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}a(t) = \\frac{u_1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\n$$\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution ($a_h(t) = C\\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}})$) and the particular solution (the steady-state value, $a_p(t) = u_1$).\n$$\na(t) = u_1 + C\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe use the initial condition $a(0) = 0$ to find the constant $C$:\n$$\na(0) = u_1 + C\\exp(0) = u_1 + C = 0 \\implies C = -u_1\n$$\nThe specific solution for the activation phase is:\n$$\na(t) = u_1 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the $10$–$90$ rise time, $T_{\\mathrm{rise}}$. This is the time difference $t_{0.9} - t_{0.1}$, where $t_{0.1}$ and $t_{0.9}$ are the times at which $a(t)$ reaches $0.1\\,u_1$ and $0.9\\,u_1$, respectively.\n\nFind $t_{0.1}$:\n$$0.1\\,u_1 = u_1 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.1}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$0.1 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.1}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.1}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right) = 0.9$$\n$$-\\frac{t_{0.1}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}} = \\ln(0.9) \\implies t_{0.1} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln(0.9)$$\n\nFind $t_{0.9}$:\n$$0.9\\,u_1 = u_1 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$0.9 = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)$$\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right) = 0.1$$\n$$-\\frac{t_{0.9}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}} = \\ln(0.1) \\implies t_{0.9} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln(0.1)$$\n\nThe rise time is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = t_{0.9} - t_{0.1} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln(0.1) - (-\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln(0.9)) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}(\\ln(0.9) - \\ln(0.1))$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.9}{0.1}\\right) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}\\ln(9)$$\nSubstituting the value for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = 0.030\\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\ln(9) \\approx 0.030 \\times 2.1972245 \\approx 0.0659167\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nIn milliseconds, $T_{\\mathrm{rise}} \\approx 65.9167\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**Part 2: Deactivation Phase and Fall Time ($t \\ge t_d$)**\n\nFor the interval $t \\ge t_d$, the neural excitation steps down to a constant value of $u(t) = u_2 = 0.2$. We must first determine the initial condition for this interval, which is the value of activation at $t = t_d$. As a state variable, activation is continuous, so $a(t_d) = a(t_d^-)$.\n$$a(t_d) = u_1 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{act}}}\\right)\\right) = 0.8 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{0.030}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe term $\\exp(-1/0.030) = \\exp(-33.33...)$ is exceedingly small, so $a(t_d) \\approx 0.8$.\nAt $t = t_d^+$, we have $u(t) = u_2 = 0.2$ and $a(t_d) \\approx 0.8$. This means $u(t)  a(t)$, so the system enters the deactivation phase, and the relevant time constant is $\\tau(u,a) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}$.\n\nThe differential equation for $t \\ge t_d$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{u_2 - a(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}a(t) = \\frac{u_2}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\n$$\nThe general solution for this interval, using a shifted time coordinate $t' = t - t_d$, is:\n$$\na(t') = u_2 + K\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t'}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)\n$$\nThe initial condition is $a(t'=0) = a(t_d)$. Let's denote $a_d = a(t_d)$.\n$$a(0) = u_2 + K = a_d \\implies K = a_d - u_2$$\nThe specific solution for the deactivation phase is:\n$$a(t) = u_2 + (a_d - u_2)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } t \\ge t_d$$\nNow, we compute the $90$–$10$ fall time, $T_{\\mathrm{fall}}$. The fall is from the starting value $a(t_d^+) = a_d$ towards the new steady-state value $a_{\\infty} = u_2$. The problem defines the fall time as the duration between reaching a value of $a_{\\infty} + 0.9(a_d - a_{\\infty})$ and $a_{\\infty} + 0.1(a_d - a_{\\infty})$.\nLet $t_{90\\%}$ be the time when $a(t)$ reaches the $90\\%$ point of its excursion:\n$$a(t_{90\\%}) = u_2 + 0.9(a_d - u_2)$$\nSubstituting this into the solution:\n$$u_2 + 0.9(a_d - u_2) = u_2 + (a_d - u_2)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{90\\%} - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)$$\n$$0.9 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{90\\%} - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)$$\n$$t_{90\\%} - t_d = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.9)$$\nLet $t_{10\\%}$ be the time when $a(t)$ reaches the $10\\%$ point of its excursion:\n$$a(t_{10\\%}) = u_2 + 0.1(a_d - u_2)$$\n$$u_2 + 0.1(a_d - u_2) = u_2 + (a_d - u_2)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{10\\%} - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)$$\n$$0.1 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{10\\%} - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)$$\n$$t_{10\\%} - t_d = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.1)$$\nThe fall time is the time difference $T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = t_{10\\%} - t_{90\\%}$. Since the activation is falling, $t_{10\\%}$ occurs after $t_{90\\%}$.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = (t_d - \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.1)) - (t_d - \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.9)) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}(\\ln(0.9) - \\ln(0.1))$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.9}{0.1}\\right) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(9)$$\nSubstituting the value for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\ln(9) \\approx 0.050 \\times 2.1972245 \\approx 0.1098612\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nIn milliseconds, $T_{\\mathrm{fall}} \\approx 109.8612\\ \\mathrm{ms}$.\n\n**Final Numerical Results**\nThe problem requests the final time values in $\\mathrm{ms}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nRise Time:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{rise}} \\approx 65.9167\\ \\mathrm{ms} \\to 65.92\\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nFall Time:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} \\approx 109.8612\\ \\mathrm{ms} \\to 109.9\\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\nThe rise and fall times are $T_{\\mathrm{rise}} = 65.92\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = 109.9\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, respectively.",
