The CE produces active force in response to neural activation, the PEE captures passive muscle fiber elasticity, and the SEE captures tendon/aponeurosis elasticity. Assume quasi-static conditions (no velocity effects), and neglect damping. Let the total MTU length be $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$, the SEE length be $l_{s}$ with slack length $l_{s0}$ and stiffness $k_{s}$, and the CE/PEE (fiber) length be $l_{m}$ with PEE slack length $l_{p0}$ and stiffness $k_{p}$. The parallel elements share the same length, so the CE and PEE both have length $l_{m}$. The SEE and the parallel pair are in series, so $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$.

            "solution": "The problem describes a three-element Hill-type muscle-tendon unit (MTU) under quasi-static conditions with zero neural activation. The model consists of a Contractile Element (CE) and a Parallel Elastic Element (PEE) arranged in parallel, with this pair connected in series with a Series Elastic Element (SEE). At zero activation, the active force from the CE is zero, $F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$. The analysis proceeds based on static equilibrium and length compatibility.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n1.  Length Compatibility: The total length of the MTU is the sum of the lengths of the series components. The parallel component, comprising the CE and PEE, has a length $l_{m}$, and the series component has a length $l_{s}$.\n    $$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$$\n2.  Static Equilibrium: In a series arrangement, the force is the same throughout. The total force in the MTU, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$, is equal to the force in the SEE, $F_{\\mathrm{SEE}}$, which is in turn equal to the total force from the parallel muscle fiber branch, $F_{m}$.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{m}$$\n    The force in the parallel branch, $F_{m}$, is the sum of the forces from the elements in parallel, the CE and the PEE.\n    $$F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$$\n3.  Constitutive Laws for Passive Elements: The passive forces are given by linear spring models.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = k_{s}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{s}-l_{s0})$$\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = k_{p}\\,\\max(0,\\,l_{m}-l_{p0})$$\n4.  Zero Activation Condition: The active force produced by the CE is zero.\n    $$F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$$\n\nCombining the equilibrium and activation conditions, we find the relationship between the passive forces:\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = 0 + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$.\nThus, for the MTU to have any passive tension, the force in the SEE must be equal to the force in the PEE:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$$\n\nWe now address the three parts of the problem.\n\n1) Explanation of the PEE's role at zero activation:\nIn a hypothetical MTU containing only a CE in series with an SEE, the total force is $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}}$. At zero activation, $F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$, which means the entire MTU can produce no force, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = 0$, regardless of its length $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$. The MTU would be completely slack and unable to resist any external load.\n\nIn the specified three-element model, the PEE is in parallel with the CE. The total force from this parallel fiber unit is $F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{CE}} + F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. At zero activation ($F_{\\mathrm{CE}} = 0$), this becomes $F_{m} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. Due to the series connection with the SEE, equilibrium requires $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{m}$. Therefore, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$. This shows that the PEE provides a pathway for force generation and transmission even when the contractile machinery is inactive.\n\nThe physical mechanism responsible is the passive elasticity of muscle tissue. The PEE models the resistance to stretching from connective tissues within and around the muscle fibers (such as the endomysium, perimysium, and epimysium) and potentially intrinsic structural proteins within the muscle cell (like titin). When the muscle is stretched ($l_{m} > l_{p0}$), these tissues behave like a spring, generating a passive force ($F_{\\mathrm{PEE}}$). This internal force is transmitted through the tendon (the SEE), resulting in a measurable tension at the ends of the whole MTU, allowing it to bear an external load passively.\n\n2) Derivation of the closed-form expression for $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}})$:\nWe seek to find $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ as a function of $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ and the given parameters. A non-zero passive force, $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$, can only exist if both the SEE and PEE are stretched beyond their respective slack lengths. When $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$:\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{SEE}} = k_{s}(l_{s} - l_{s0})$\n$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = F_{\\mathrm{PEE}} = k_{p}(l_{m} - l_{p0})$\n\nWe can express the component lengths, $l_s$ and $l_m$, in terms of the force $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$:\n$$l_{s} = l_{s0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{s}}$$\n$$l_{m} = l_{p0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{p}}$$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the length compatibility equation, $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = l_{s} + l_{m}$:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = \\left(l_{s0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{s}}\\right) + \\left(l_{p0} + \\frac{F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}}{k_{p}}\\right)$$\nWe can now isolate $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$. First, we group the terms:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - (l_{s0} + l_{p0}) = F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\left(\\frac{1}{k_{s}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p}}\\right)$$\nTo find the common denominator for the stiffness term:\n$$\\frac{1}{k_{s}} + \\frac{1}{k_{p}} = \\frac{k_{p} + k_{s}}{k_{s}k_{p}}$$\nSubstituting this back and solving for $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ yields:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0} = F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\left(\\frac{k_{s} + k_{p}}{k_{s} k_{p}}\\right)$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} = \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) (L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$$\nThis expression is valid only when $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0$. This occurs when the term $(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$ is positive, since the effective stiffness $\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}$ is inherently positive. If $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} \\le l_{s0} + l_{p0}$, the MTU is not stretched enough to engage both passive elements, so the passive force is zero. This piecewise behavior can be captured compactly using the $\\max$ function:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}(L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}) = \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) \\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0})$$\nThis expression shows that the two passive elements in series behave as a single spring with an effective stiffness equal to the harmonic sum of the individual stiffnesses and a slack length equal to the sum of the individual slack lengths.\n\n3) Condition for nonzero load-bearing at zero activation:\nAn MTU can bear a nonzero external load at zero activation if its passive tension $F_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ is greater than zero. Using the expression derived in part 2):\n$$F_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > 0 \\implies \\left(\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}\\right) \\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0}) > 0$$\nSince stiffnesses $k_{s}$ and $k_{p}$ are positive physical constants, their product and sum are also positive. The pre-factor $\\frac{k_{s} k_{p}}{k_{s} + k_{p}}$ is therefore strictly positive. The inequality simplifies to:\n$$\\max(0, L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0}) > 0$$\nThe $\\max$ function of $0$ and a value is greater than $0$ if and only if that value itself is greater than $0$. Thus, the condition is:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} - l_{s0} - l_{p0} > 0$$\nOr, rewritten as:\n$$L_{\\mathrm{MTU}} > l_{s0} + l_{p0}$$\nThis is the condition on $L_{\\mathrm{MTU}}$ under which the MTU can bear a nonzero external load without any active force generation. Physically, it states that the total length of the muscle-tendon unit must exceed the sum of the slack lengths of its constituent series and parallel elastic elements.",

            "solution": "**Part (i): Condition for Zero Transmitted Force**\n\nThe problem asks for the condition on the total MTU length, $l_{\\text{MTU}}$, under which a change in $l_{\\text{MTU}}$ can occur with zero transmitted force, $F_{\\text{MTU}} = 0$. This phenomenon is known as \"taking up the slack\".\n\nFrom the series force equilibrium, $F_{\\text{MTU}} = F_{\\text{SEE}}$. For the transmitted force to be zero, the force in the SEE must be zero, which occurs if and only if its length is less than or equal to its slack length:\n$$l_{\\text{SEE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nUsing the geometric constraint $l_{\\text{MTU}} = l_{\\text{CE}} + l_{\\text{SEE}}$, we can express the SEE length as $l_{\\text{SEE}} = l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE}}$. Substituting this into the zero-force condition gives:\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nFor the MTU to maintain zero force while its total length changes, the CE must be able to change its length to accommodate the change. The CE's ability to shorten is limited by its minimum physiological length, $l_{\\text{CE}} \\ge l_{\\text{CE,min}}$.\n\nThe MTU can maintain zero force as long as the CE can shorten enough to keep the SEE slack. The limit occurs when the CE reaches its minimum length, $l_{\\text{CE,min}}$. At this point, the condition for zero force is:\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} - l_{\\text{CE,min}} \\le l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\nRearranging this gives the final condition. As long as the MTU length satisfies this inequality, it is possible to find a valid state where the muscle transmits no force externally.\n$$l_{\\text{MTU}} \\le l_{\\text{CE,min}} + l_{\\text{SEE,slack}}$$\n\n**Part (ii): Calculation of the Minimal Activation Threshold ($a_{\\text{th}}$)**\n\nWe need to find the activation $a_{\\text{th}}$ for the specified quasi-static equilibrium state:\n1.

The ODE is:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = \\frac{u_2 - a(t)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\n$$\nThe solution, starting from $a(t_d) = a_d$ and approaching the new steady-state $a_{\\infty}=u_2$, is:\n$$a(t) = u_2 + (a_d - u_2)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t - t_d}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}}\\right)$$\nThe $90$–$10$ fall time is the duration over which the activation drops from $a_{\\infty} + 0.9(a_d - a_{\\infty})$ to $a_{\\infty} + 0.1(a_d - a_{\\infty})$.\nLet $t_{90\\%}$ and $t_{10\\%}$ be the times when the excursion $(a(t) - a_\\infty)$ is $90\\%$ and $10\\%$ of the total excursion $(a_d - a_\\infty)$, respectively.\n- For the $90\\%$ point: $0.9(a_d-u_2) = (a_d - u_2)\\exp(-(t_{90\\%} - t_d)/\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}})$, which gives $t_{90\\%} - t_d = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.9)$.\n- For the $10\\%$ point: $0.1(a_d-u_2) = (a_d - u_2)\\exp(-(t_{10\\%} - t_d)/\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}})$, which gives $t_{10\\%} - t_d = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.1)$.\n\nThe fall time is the difference $T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = t_{10\\%} - t_{90\\%}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = (-\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.1) + t_d) - (-\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(0.9) + t_d) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}(\\ln(0.9) - \\ln(0.1))$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}\\ln(9)$$\nSubstituting the value for $\\tau_{\\mathrm{deact}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{fall}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{s} \\times \\ln(9) \\approx 0.10986\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 109.9\\ \\mathrm{ms}$$\n\nThe computed rise and fall times, rounded to four significant figures, are $65.92\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ and $109.9\\ \\mathrm{ms}$, respectively.",
