            "problem": "An exoskeleton knee module applies a pure flexion torque about the knee joint to assist a user during slow, quasi-static motion. The module is mechanically coupled to the limb via two rigid attachment cuffs: a proximal cuff on the thigh and a distal cuff on the shank. Assume a planar sagittal-plane model and that each cuff transmits a resultant tangential shear force perpendicular to its respective limb segment. The knee joint itself is modeled as a frictionless hinge. At a particular instant, the exoskeleton delivers a flexion torque of magnitude $\\tau_{k}$ about the knee joint center. The proximal cuff centerline is located a distance $l_{p}$ proximal to the knee joint center along the thigh axis, and the distal cuff centerline is located a distance $l_{d}$ distal to the knee joint center along the shank axis.

The problem is based on verifiable principles of classical mechanics.\n\n#### Verdict\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem is governed by the principles of static equilibrium for a rigid body in a plane. The system under consideration is the human limb (thigh and shank), which is subjected to forces from the exoskeleton cuffs.\n\nThe key premise is that the interaction between the exoskeleton and the limb constitutes a \"net pure couple\". A pure couple is a system of forces whose resultant force is zero, but whose resultant moment (torque) is non-zero. The forces applied by the exoskeleton to the limb are the proximal cuff force, $\\vec{F}_{p}$, and the distal cuff force, $\\vec{F}_{d}$.\n\nThe condition of zero resultant force is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum \\vec{F}_{\\text{ext}} = \\vec{F}_{p} + \\vec{F}_{d} = \\vec{0}\n$$\nThis vector equation implies that the two forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction:\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{p} = -\\vec{F}_{d}\n$$\nConsequently, their magnitudes are equal. Let $F_{p} = |\\vec{F}_{p}|$ and $F_{d} = |\\vec{F}_{d}|$. Then:\n$$\nF_{p} = F_{d}\n$$\nThis is consistent with the problem statement that one force is posterior-directed and the other is anterior-directed.\n\nThe second part of the pure couple definition is that it produces a net torque. The problem states this is a flexion torque of magnitude $\\tau_{k}$ about the knee joint center. This torque is the sum of the moments generated by the individual cuff forces about the knee joint. Let's designate the knee joint center as the origin of our coordinate system.\n\nThe moment (torque) $\\vec{\\tau}$ generated by a force $\\vec{F}$ applied at a position $\\vec{r}$ is given by $\\vec{\\tau} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}$. The magnitude of the torque is $\\tau = rF\\sin\\theta$, where $\\theta$ is the angle between $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}$.\n\nThe problem states that the cuff forces are \"tangential shear force perpendicular to its respective limb segment\". The distances $l_{p}$ and $l_{d}$ are measured along the limb segments. Therefore, the position vectors from the knee joint to the cuffs are perpendicular to the force vectors. The angle $\\theta$ is $90^\\circ$, and $\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$. The distances $l_{p}$ and $l_{d}$ act as the lever arms for the forces $F_{p}$ and $F_{d}$, respectively.\n\nThe torque from the proximal cuff is $\\tau_{p} = l_{p} F_{p}$.\nThe torque from the distal cuff is $\\tau_{d} = l_{d} F_{d}$.\n\nThe problem specifies that both forces contribute to a flexion moment, meaning their torques about the knee joint are in the same direction and thus add up. The total torque magnitude $\\tau_{k}$ is:\n$$\n\\tau_{k} = \\tau_{p} + \\tau_{d} = l_{p} F_{p} + l_{d} F_{d}\n$$\nNow, we use the condition derived from the zero resultant force, $F_{p} = F_{d}$. Let's denote this common magnitude as $F_{\\text{cuff}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{k} = l_{p} F_{\\text{cuff}} + l_{d} F_{\\text{cuff}}\n$$\nFactoring out $F_{\\text{cuff}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{k} = (l_{p} + l_{d}) F_{\\text{cuff}}\n$$\nWe can solve for the cuff force magnitude:\n$$\nF_{\\text{cuff}} = \\frac{\\tau_{k}}{l_{p} + l_{d}}\n$$\nSince $F_{p} = F_d = F_{\\text{cuff}}$, we have found the magnitudes of both forces:\n$$\nF_{p} = F_{d} = \\frac{\\tau_{k}}{l_{p} + l_{d}}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $\\tau_{k} = 42~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$\n-   $l_{p} = 0.12~\\text{m}$\n-   $l_{d} = 0.08~\\text{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\nF_{p} = F_{d} = \\frac{42~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.12~\\text{m} + 0.08~\\text{m}} = \\frac{42~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}}{0.20~\\text{m}} = 210~\\text{N}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $210$ can be expressed as $210.0$ to meet this requirement.\nThus, $F_{p} = 210.0~\\text{N}$ and $F_{d} = 210.0~\\text{N}$.\n\nThe final answer is to be presented as a row vector $\\big[F_{p}~F_{d}\\big]$.",

This moment is given by $\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g$.\n\nThe sum of external moments about the ankle, $A$, is therefore:\n$$ \\sum \\boldsymbol{M}_A = \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_h + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{exo} + (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}}) + (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g) $$\n\nSubstituting this into the general equation of motion gives the complete inverse dynamics formulation for the ankle joint moment:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_h + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{exo} + (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}}) + (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g) = I_G \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} + \\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times (m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G) $$\n\nWe can now solve for the unknown human ankle moment, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_h$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_h = I_G \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} + \\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times (m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G) - \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{exo} - (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}}) - (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g) $$\n\nSince the problem is planar, all vector quantities for rotation ($\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_h$, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_{exo}$) and moments from forces are directed along the $z$-axis. We can simplify the vector equation to a scalar equation for the $z$-components. Let $\\tau_h$ and $\\tau_{exo}$ be the scalar $z$-components of the respective torque vectors. For two vectors in the $xy$-plane, $\\boldsymbol{u} = (u_x, u_y, 0)$ and $\\boldsymbol{v} = (v_x, v_y, 0)$, the $z$-component of their cross product is $(\\boldsymbol{u} \\times \\boldsymbol{v})_z = u_x v_y - u_y v_x$.\n\nThe scalar equation for $\\tau_h$ is:\n$$ \\tau_h = I_G \\alpha_z + (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G)_z - \\tau_{exo} - (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}})_z - (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g)_z $$\n\nWe now compute each term using the given values:\n- Foot mass: $m_f = 1.2\\ \\mathrm{kg}$\n- Moment of inertia: $I_G = 0.023\\ \\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2}$\n- Angular acceleration: $\\alpha_z = -8\\ \\mathrm{rad/s^2}$\n- COM linear acceleration: $\\boldsymbol{a}_G = (0.8, 1.0, 0)\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- GRF: $\\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}} = (-70, 950, 0)\\ \\mathrm{N}$\n- COP location: $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} = (0.12, -0.09, 0)\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- COM location: $\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} = (0.07, -0.04, 0)\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 9.81\\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- Exoskeleton torque: $\\tau_{exo} = -25\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$\n\n1.  Inertial torque term:\n    $$ I_G \\alpha_z = (0.023) \\times (-8) = -0.184\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n\n2.  Moment from ground reaction force:\n    $$ (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{COP}/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_{\\mathrm{GRF}})_z = (0.12)(950) - (-0.09)(-70) = 114 - 6.3 = 107.7\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n\n3.  Moment from gravity:\n    First, compute the gravitational force vector $\\boldsymbol{F}_g = (0, -m_f g, 0)$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{F}_g = (0, -(1.2)(9.81), 0) = (0, -11.772, 0)\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n    Now, compute the moment:\n    $$ (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times \\boldsymbol{F}_g)_z = (0.07)(-11.772) - (-0.04)(0) = -0.82404\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n\n4.  The \"kinetic moment\" term, often called the moment of the effective force:\n    First, compute $m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G$.\n    $$ m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G = (1.2)(0.8, 1.0, 0) = (0.96, 1.2, 0)\\ \\mathrm{N} $$\n    Now, compute the cross product:\n    $$ (\\boldsymbol{r}_{G/A} \\times m_f \\boldsymbol{a}_G)_z = (0.07)(1.2) - (-0.04)(0.96) = 0.084 + 0.0384 = 0.1224\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n\nFinally, substitute all these calculated values back into the equation for $\\tau_h$:\n$$ \\tau_h = (-0.184) + (0.1224) - (-25) - (107.7) - (-0.82404) $$\n$$ \\tau_h = -0.184 + 0.1224 + 25 - 107.7 + 0.82404 $$\n$$ \\tau_h = (25 + 0.1224 + 0.82404) - (0.184 + 107.7) $$\n$$ \\tau_h = 25.94644 - 107.884 $$\n$$ \\tau_h = -81.93756\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\tau_h \\approx -81.94\\ \\mathrm{N\\cdot m} $$\nThe negative sign indicates a clockwise moment. According to the problem's sign convention, this corresponds to a plantarflexion moment being generated by the human at the ankle joint, which is a physiologically expected result for the stance phase of gait.",
