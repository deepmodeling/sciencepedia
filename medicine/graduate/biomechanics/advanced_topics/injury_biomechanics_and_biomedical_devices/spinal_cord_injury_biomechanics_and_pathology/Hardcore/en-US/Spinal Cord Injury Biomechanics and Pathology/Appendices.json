Consider the spinal cord microcirculation modeled as a hydraulic circuit in which flow is driven by a pressure gradient and opposed by a constant hydraulic resistance.

A full solution is warranted.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the new spinal cord perfusion pressure ($SCPP_{new}$) and the fractional drop in oxygen delivery.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the new Spinal Cord Perfusion Pressure ($SCPP_{new}$)**\n\nSpinal cord perfusion pressure ($SCPP$) is defined as the pressure gradient that drives blood flow through the spinal cord. It is the difference between the mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) and the cerebrospinal fluid pressure ($CSFP$), which acts as the perivascular pressure.\n$$SCPP = MAP - CSFP$$\nThe problem provides the baseline $CSFP_{base} = 12$ mmHg and states that swelling causes an increase of $\\Delta CSFP = 10$ mmHg. The new $CSFP$ value, denoted as $CSFP_{new}$, is therefore:\n$$CSFP_{new} = CSFP_{base} + \\Delta CSFP = 12 \\text{ mmHg} + 10 \\text{ mmHg} = 22 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nThe mean arterial pressure ($MAP$) is given as constant at $85$ mmHg. The new spinal cord perfusion pressure, $SCPP_{new}$, is calculated as:\n$$SCPP_{new} = MAP - CSFP_{new} = 85 \\text{ mmHg} - 22 \\text{ mmHg} = 63 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $SCPP_{new} = 63.00$ mmHg.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Fractional Drop in Oxygen Delivery**\n\nOxygen delivery to the spinal cord ($DO_2$) is the product of spinal cord blood flow ($SCBF$) and the arterial oxygen content ($C_{aO_2}$).\n$$DO_2 = SCBF \\times C_{aO_2}$$\nThe spinal cord microcirculation is modeled as a hydraulic circuit where blood flow ($SCBF$) is analogous to current, the perfusion pressure ($SCPP$) is analogous to a voltage drop, and the hydraulic resistance ($R$) is analogous to electrical resistance. This relationship is described by:\n$$SCBF = \\frac{SCPP}{R}$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for oxygen delivery gives:\n$$DO_2 = \\frac{SCPP}{R} \\times C_{aO_2}$$\nThe fractional drop in oxygen delivery is defined as the change in delivery divided by the baseline delivery:\n$$\\text{Fractional Drop} = \\frac{DO_{2, base} - DO_{2, new}}{DO_{2, base}} = 1 - \\frac{DO_{2, new}}{DO_{2, base}}$$\nHere, $DO_{2, base}$ is the oxygen delivery under baseline conditions and $DO_{2, new}$ is the delivery after the increase in $CSFP$.\n\nUsing the expression for $DO_2$, we can write the ratio $\\frac{DO_{2, new}}{DO_{2, base}}$ as:\n$$\\frac{DO_{2, new}}{DO_{2, base}} = \\frac{\\frac{SCPP_{new}}{R} \\times C_{aO_2}}{\\frac{SCPP_{base}}{R} \\times C_{aO_2}}$$\nSince the problem states that the resistance $R$ and the arterial oxygen content $C_{aO_2}$ remain unchanged, these terms cancel out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\\frac{DO_{2, new}}{DO_{2, base}} = \\frac{SCPP_{new}}{SCPP_{base}}$$\nFirst, we must calculate the baseline perfusion pressure, $SCPP_{base}$:\n$$SCPP_{base} = MAP - CSFP_{base} = 85 \\text{ mmHg} - 12 \\text{ mmHg} = 73 \\text{ mmHg}$$\nWe have already calculated $SCPP_{new} = 63$ mmHg.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into the equation for the fractional drop:\n$$\\text{Fractional Drop} = 1 - \\frac{SCPP_{new}}{SCPP_{base}} = 1 - \\frac{63}{73}$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\\frac{63}{73} \\approx 0.86301369...$$\nSubtracting from $1$:\n$$\\text{Fractional Drop} = 1 - 0.86301369... = 0.13698630...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.1370$.\n\nThe two required results are the new $SCPP$ of $63.00$ mmHg and the fractional drop in oxygen delivery of $0.1370$.",

It is deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to find the tissue's Young’s modulus, $E$. The experimental setup is not a simple uniaxial compression test due to the frictional constraint at the interfaces between the tissue and the platens. The problem states this constraint results in a \"near plane-strain condition\". For an axisymmetric cylindrical specimen under axial compression (along the $z$-axis), this condition implies that the radial strain, $\\epsilon_r$, is approximately zero in the bulk of the material.\n\nLet us define the engineering axial stress $\\sigma_z$ and axial strain $\\epsilon_z$.

For a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic material, the generalized Hooke's Law in a cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$ is:\n$$ \\epsilon_z = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_z - \\nu(\\sigma_r + \\sigma_\\theta) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_r - \\nu(\\sigma_\\theta + \\sigma_z) \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_\\theta - \\nu(\\sigma_r + \\sigma_z) \\right] $$\nDue to the axial symmetry of the loading and geometry, the stress and strain components in the radial and circumferential directions are equal: $\\sigma_r = \\sigma_\\theta$ and $\\epsilon_r = \\epsilon_\\theta$.

Second, we formulate a linear least squares problem to estimate the material parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$ from experimental data.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Stress-Stretch Relationship**\n\nThe analysis begins from fundamental principles of continuum mechanics for an incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic material.\n\n1.  **Kinematics of Uniaxial Tension**\n\n    For a uniaxial tensile test along the principal axis $x_1$ (rostrocaudal direction), the axial stretch is denoted by $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$. Due to the material's isotropy and the traction-free condition on lateral surfaces, the stretches in the transverse directions are equal: $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3$.\n\n    The incompressibility constraint requires that the volume remains constant, which means the determinant of the deformation gradient $F$, $J = \\det(F)$, must be equal to $1$.\n    $$ J = \\lambda_1 \\lambda_2 \\lambda_3 = 1 $$\n    Substituting the stretches gives:\n    $$ \\lambda \\lambda_2^2 = 1 \\implies \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda}} = \\lambda^{-1/2} $$\n    The principal stretches are therefore $(\\lambda, \\lambda^{-1/2}, \\lambda^{-1/2})$.\n\n    The deformation gradient tensor $F$ in the principal coordinate system is a diagonal matrix:\n    $$ [F] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1/2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, $B$, is defined as $B = FF^T$. Since $F$ is diagonal, $B = F^2$:\n    $$ [B] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^2 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda^{-1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n2.  **Strain Invariants**\n\n    The principal invariants of the tensor $B$ are functions of the principal stretches.\n    The first invariant, $I_1$, is the trace of $B$:\n    $$ I_1 = \\mathrm{tr}(B) = \\lambda_1^2 + \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_3^2 = \\lambda^2 + (\\lambda^{-1/2})^2 + (\\lambda^{-1/2})^2 = \\lambda^2 + 2\\lambda^{-1} $$\n    The second invariant, $I_2$, can be calculated as:\n    $$ I_2 = \\lambda_1^2 \\lambda_2^2 + \\lambda_2^2 \\lambda_3^2 + \\lambda_3^2 \\lambda_1^2 = (\\lambda^2)(\\lambda^{-1}) + (\\lambda^{-1})(\\lambda^{-1}) + (\\lambda^{-1})(\\lambda^2) = \\lambda + \\lambda^{-2} + \\lambda = 2\\lambda + \\lambda^{-2} $$\n    The third invariant, $I_3$, is the determinant of $B$:\n    $$ I_3 = \\det(B) = (\\det(F))^2 = J^2 = 1^2 = 1 $$\n    This confirms consistency with the incompressibility constraint.\n\n3.  **Cauchy Stress for a Mooney-Rivlin Material**\n\n    The general constitutive equation for the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ in an incompressible, isotropic, hyperelastic material is given by:\n    $$ \\sigma = -pI + 2\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1}B - 2\\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_2}B^{-1} $$\n    where $p$ is an arbitrary hydrostatic pressure arising from the incompressibility constraint, $I$ is the identity tensor, and $W = W(I_1, I_2)$ is the strain energy density function.\n\n    The problem specifies a two-term Mooney-Rivlin model:\n    $$ W = C_1(I_1 - 3) + C_2(I_2 - 3) $$\n    The partial derivatives of $W$ with respect to the invariants are:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_1} = C_1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial W}{\\partial I_2} = C_2 $$\n    Substituting these into the stress equation yields:\n    $$ \\sigma = -pI + 2C_1B - 2C_2B^{-1} $$\n    The inverse of the left Cauchy-Green tensor, $B^{-1}$, is:\n    $$ [B^{-1}] = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda^{-2} & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    The components of the stress tensor in the principal coordinate system are:\n    $$ \\sigma_{11} = -p + 2C_1\\lambda^2 - 2C_2\\lambda^{-2} $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{22} = -p + 2C_1\\lambda^{-1} - 2C_2\\lambda $$\n    $$ \\sigma_{33} = -p + 2C_1\\lambda^{-1} - 2C_2\\lambda $$\n    For uniaxial tension, the lateral faces are traction-free, meaning the stress components normal to these faces are zero: $\\sigma_{22} = \\sigma_{33} = 0$. Using this boundary condition, we can solve for the pressure $p$:\n    $$ 0 = -p + 2C_1\\lambda^{-1} - 2C_2\\lambda \\implies p = 2C_1\\lambda^{-1} - 2C_2\\lambda $$\n    The axial stress, $\\sigma = \\sigma_{11}$, is the only non-zero principal stress. Substituting the expression for $p$ into the equation for $\\sigma_{11}$:\n    $$ \\sigma = -(2C_1\\lambda^{-1} - 2C_2\\lambda) + 2C_1\\lambda^2 - 2C_2\\lambda^{-2} $$\n    Rearranging the terms to group $C_1$ and $C_2$:\n    $$ \\sigma = (2C_1\\lambda^2 - 2C_1\\lambda^{-1}) + (2C_2\\lambda - 2C_2\\lambda^{-2}) $$\n    $$ \\sigma = 2(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-1})C_1 + 2(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-2})C_2 $$\n    This is the final expression relating the axial Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ to the axial stretch $\\lambda$ and the material parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\n**Part 2: Linear Least Squares Parameter Estimation**\n\nThe derived stress-stretch relation is linear with respect to the parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$. Given a set of $n$ experimental data points $(\\lambda_i, \\sigma_i)$, we can formulate a linear system to estimate $C_1$ and $C_2$.\n\nFor each data point $i=1, \\dots, n$, we have:\n$$ \\sigma_i = 2(\\lambda_i^2 - \\lambda_i^{-1})C_1 + 2(\\lambda_i - \\lambda_i^{-2})C_2 $$\nThis can be written in matrix form as $y = Ax$, where:\n- $y$ is the vector of observed stresses: $y = [\\sigma_1, \\sigma_2, \\dots, \\sigma_n]^T$.\n- $x$ is the vector of unknown parameters: $x = [C_1, C_2]^T$.\n- $A$ is the design matrix, where each row $i$ is constructed from the corresponding stretch $\\lambda_i$:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2(\\lambda_1^2 - \\lambda_1^{-1}) & 2(\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_1^{-2}) \\\\\n2(\\lambda_2^2 - \\lambda_2^{-1}) & 2(\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_2^{-2}) \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\n2(\\lambda_n^2 - \\lambda_n^{-1}) & 2(\\lambda_n - \\lambda_n^{-2})\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nNote that for the undeformed state ($\\lambda = 1$), both terms $2(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-1})$ and $2(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-2})$ are zero, leading to the trivial equation $\\sigma = 0 = 0 \\cdot C_1 + 0 \\cdot C_2$. This data point provides no information for estimating the parameters and is thus excluded from the system of equations.\n\nThe system is typically overdetermined ($n > 2$), so we seek a solution that minimizes the sum of squared errors, $\\|y - Ax\\|^2$. The solution to this linear least squares problem is given by the normal equations:\n$$ A^T A x = A^T y $$\nSolving for $x$ gives the estimated parameters:\n$$ x = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T y $$\nThis calculation will be performed numerically for each provided test case.",
