This exercise uses a simplified but powerful model of a helmeted head to explore how elastic strain energy is distributed between a compliant protective padding and the stiffer cranial bone .

            "problem": "A helmeted human head normal impact is modeled as two homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic layers loaded in series: a cranial bone layer (skull) and a compliant padding layer (helmet liner), both sharing the same circular contact patch. The contact patch has area $A = 0.006\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. The skull layer has thickness $t_{s} = 0.007\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and elastic modulus $E_{s} = 15 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$. The padding layer has thickness $t_{p} = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and elastic modulus $E_{p} = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.

Assume that at the instant of peak load the response is quasi-static, both layers remain in their linear elastic regime, and the load is uniformly distributed over the contact area.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of stress $\\sigma$, strain $\\epsilon$, Hooke’s law $\\sigma = E\\epsilon$, the geometric relation between strain and displacement for each layer, and equilibrium of series-connected elastic elements (the same axial force transmits through each layer), derive the expressions that distinguish local material compliance from global structural compliance for this two-layer system.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, albeit simplified, model in biomechanics that is solvable using fundamental principles of solid mechanics. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are clearly stated and physically reasonable for the scope of the problem.\n\nThe solution is developed by first establishing the governing physical and mathematical principles as requested. The model consists of two elastic layers, the skull ($s$) and padding ($p$), connected in series. This means they share the same contact area $A$ and are subjected to the same normal force $F(t)$. At the moment of peak quasi-static load, this force is $F = F_{\\max}$.\n\nThe definition of uniaxial stress, $\\sigma$, is the force per unit area. Since the force $F_{\\max}$ and area $A$ are common to both layers, the stress in each layer is identical:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = \\sigma_p = \\sigma = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\n$$\n\nThe definition of uniaxial strain, $\\epsilon$, is the change in length per unit original length. For each layer with thickness $t$, the compression (displacement) $\\delta$ is related to strain by $\\epsilon = \\delta/t$.\n\nHooke's law for a linear elastic material relates stress and strain via the elastic modulus, $E$:\n$$\n\\sigma = E \\epsilon\n$$\nApplying this to each layer, we find the strain in the skull and padding:\n$$\n\\epsilon_s = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_s} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\epsilon_p = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_p}\n$$\n\nThe compression of each layer, $\\delta_s$ and $\\delta_p$, can be expressed in terms of the applied force:\n$$\n\\delta_s = \\epsilon_s t_s = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_s} t_s = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_s}{E_s}\n$$\n$$\n\\delta_p = \\epsilon_p t_p = \\frac{\\sigma}{E_p} t_p = \\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_p}{E_p}\n$$\n\nThe structural stiffness, $k$, of an element is defined by the relation $F = k\\delta$. For each layer, the stiffness is:\n$$\nk_s = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\delta_s} = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_s}{E_s}} = \\frac{A E_s}{t_s}\n$$\n$$\nk_p = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\delta_p} = \\frac{F_{\\max}}{\\left(\\frac{F_{\\max}}{A}\\right) \\frac{t_p}{E_p}} = \\frac{A E_p}{t_p}\n$$\n\nThese expressions allow us to distinguish between local material compliance and global structural compliance.\n- **Local material compliance** is an intrinsic material property, defined as the inverse of the elastic modulus, $1/E$. It quantifies a material's inherent deformability under stress, independent of its size or shape. A material with a high value of $1/E$ (or low $E$) is highly compliant.\n- **Global structural compliance**, $C_{struct}$, is an extrinsic property of a component, defined as the inverse of its stiffness, $C_{struct} = 1/k$. For our layers, this is $C_{struct} = t/(AE)$. This expression explicitly shows that the overall deformability of the structure depends not only on the material's property ($E$) but also on its geometry (thickness $t$ and area $A$).\n\nThe elastic strain energy, $U$, stored in a linearly elastic body can be expressed in several equivalent forms. A convenient form for this problem is $U = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F^2}{k}$. Applying this to the skull and padding layers at the instant of peak force $F_{\\max}$:\n$$\nU_s = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{k_s} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU_p = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{k_p} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_p}{A E_p}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe total elastic strain energy stored in the two-layer system is the sum of the energies in each layer:\n$$\nU_{total} = U_s + U_p\n$$\n\nWe are asked to find the fraction of the total energy stored in the skull. This is the ratio $\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{U_s}{U_s + U_p} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_s}{A E_s}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\max}^2 \\left(\\frac{t_p}{A E_p}\\right)}\n$$\nThe common factor of $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{F_{\\max}^2}{A}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, yielding the desired energy partition expression:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{t_s}{E_s}}{\\frac{t_s}{E_s} + \\frac{t_p}{E_p}}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that the partitioning of strain energy in a series-loaded system is independent of the applied force and the contact area, and is determined solely by the ratio of the structural compliances per unit area, $t/E$, for each layer.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values to compute the fraction:\n- Skull thickness, $t_s = 0.007\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Skull elastic modulus, $E_s = 15 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Padding thickness, $t_p = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Padding elastic modulus, $E_p = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the compliance-thickness terms for each layer:\n$$\n\\frac{t_s}{E_s} = \\frac{0.007}{15 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{7 \\times 10^{-3}}{15 \\times 10^{9}} = \\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa} \\approx 4.6667 \\times 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{t_p}{E_p} = \\frac{0.020}{40 \\times 10^{6}} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-2}}{4 \\times 10^{7}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa} = 500 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{m/Pa}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute these into the fraction expression:\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12}}{\\frac{7}{15} \\times 10^{-12} + 500 \\times 10^{-12}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7}{15} + 500}\n$$\nTo combine the terms in the denominator: $500 = \\frac{7500}{15}$.\n$$\n\\frac{U_s}{U_{total}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7}{15} + \\frac{7500}{15}} = \\frac{\\frac{7}{15}}{\\frac{7507}{15}} = \\frac{7}{7507}\n$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\n\\frac{7}{7507} \\approx 0.0009324629...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the fraction of the total elastic strain energy stored in the skull is $0.0009325$.",

            "solution": "The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) is defined via the time-averaged acceleration over a window $[t_1,t_2]$ and a maximization over feasible windows whose duration does not exceed a specified limit $T^{\\ast}$.

For such a window, the acceleration is constant, so the time average equals the constant value:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a(t)\\, dt = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} a_0\\, dt = \\frac{1}{t_2 - t_1}\\, a_0 (t_2 - t_1) = a_0.\n$$\nThus, for windows fully inside the rectangular pulse,\n$$\nH(t_1,t_2) = (t_2 - t_1)\\left[a_0\\right]^{2.5} = a_0^{2.5}(t_2 - t_1).\n$$\nThis expression is linear in the window duration $(t_2 - t_1)$, which implies that within the pulse, $H(t_1,t_2)$ is monotonically increasing with the window length. Therefore, the maximum value over windows entirely inside the pulse is achieved by choosing the longest such window. Because $\\Delta t \\leq T^{\\ast}$ by assumption, the longest window fully inside the pulse is the entire pulse itself, with $t_1=0$ and $t_2=\\Delta t$. Hence,\n$$\nH_{\\text{inside,max}} = a_0^{2.5}\\Delta t.\n$$\n\nNext, consider windows that extend beyond the pulse and include times where $a(t)=0$. Suppose a window $[t_1,t_2]$ of duration $\\tau \\equiv t_2 - t_1$ overlaps the pulse over an amount $\\ell \\leq \\min\\{\\tau,\\Delta t\\}$, and includes $(\\tau - \\ell)$ duration of zero acceleration.

The maximum with respect to $\\tau$ at fixed $\\ell$ occurs at the smallest possible $\\tau$, which is $\\tau=\\ell$ (i.e., the window lies entirely inside the pulse). Substituting $\\tau=\\ell$ yields\n$$\nH_{\\text{overlap,max at fixed } \\ell} = a_0^{2.5}\\, \\ell.\n$$\nThis is maximized by choosing the largest possible overlap $\\ell$, which is $\\ell=\\Delta t$ (the full pulse). Therefore, among all windows that include any time outside the pulse, the maximal value is no greater than the value obtained by the window that exactly spans the pulse and contains no zero-acceleration time.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of impact biomechanics, mathematically well-posed, and all definitions and data are provided unambiguously. The task is to calculate the maximum Viscous Criterion ($VC_{\\max}$) and the associated probability of severe injury for several test cases defined by chest compression time histories. The solution proceeds by implementing the sequence of steps specified in the problem statement.\n\nThe core of the problem is the Viscous Criterion, a metric defined in impact biomechanics as $VC(t) = C(t) \\cdot v(t)$, where $C(t)$ is the normalized chest compression and $v(t)$ is the chest compression velocity. We are given discrete time series data, so we must use numerical methods.\n\nFirst, for each test case with a total duration $T$ and a sampling interval $\\Delta t$, we generate a discrete time vector. The number of samples is $N+1$, where $N = \\text{round}(T/\\Delta t)$. The time points are given by $t_i = i \\cdot \\Delta t$ for $i = 0, 1, \\dots, N$.\n\nSecond, we generate the chest compression history, which is a discrete vector $x$ of length $N+1$. For each time point $t_i$, we evaluate the compression $x_i = x(t_i)$ using the specified analytical function. For the \"half_sine\" shape with amplitude $A$, the function is $x(t) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right)$, so $x_i = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t_i}{T}\\right)$. For the \"constant\" shape, the function is $x(t) = A$, so $x_i = A$ for all $i$.\n\nThird, we compute the chest velocity history $v$ from the discrete compression history $x$. Since velocity is the time derivative of displacement, $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$, we approximate this derivative numerically. The problem specifies a hybrid finite difference scheme:\n- At the initial point ($i=0$), a first-order forward difference is used: $v_0 = \\frac{x_1 - x_0}{\\Delta t}$.\n- At the final point ($i=N$), a first-order backward difference is used: $v_N = \\frac{x_N - x_{N-1}}{\\Delta t}$.\n- For all interior points ($i=1, \\dots, N-1$), a second-order central difference is used for higher accuracy: $v_i = \\frac{x_{i+1} - x_{i-1}}{2 \\Delta t}$.\n\nFourth, we calculate the pointwise Viscous Criterion, $VC_i$. This requires two sub-steps:\n1. The compression $x_i$ is normalized by the initial chest depth $D_0$ to yield the dimensionless normalized compression $C_i = \\frac{x_i}{D_0}$.\n2. The pointwise viscous response is then the product $VC_i = C_i \\cdot v_i$. The units are meters per second, as $C_i$ is dimensionless and $v_i$ is in meters per second.\n\nFifth, we determine the summary metric, $VC_{\\max}$, by finding the maximum value across the entire $VC$ history: $VC_{\\max} = \\max_{i=0, \\dots, N} VC_i$.\n\nFinally, we perform the injury risk assessment based on $VC_{\\max}$:\n1. We compare $VC_{\\max}$ to the critical threshold $VC_{\\text{crit}} = 1.0 \\, \\text{m/s}$. The result is a boolean value indicating whether the threshold is met or exceeded ($VC_{\\max} \\ge VC_{\\text{crit}}$).\n2.
