The model of a screw as a cylinder failing in shear is a standard and valid first-order approximation in orthopedic biomechanics. The provided numerical values for screw dimensions and interface shear strength are physically realistic.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear objective and all necessary data ($L$, $d$, $\\tau$) to compute a unique solution. The instructions are unambiguous.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language common to engineering mechanics.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be formulated.\n\nThe axial pullout force, which we denote as $F_{pullout}$, is defined as the total shear force acting on the interface between the bone and the screw. This force is the result of integrating the interfacial shear traction, $\\tau_{interface}$, over the entire lateral surface area of the embedded portion of the screw, $A_{shear}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nF_{pullout} = \\int_{A_{shear}} \\tau_{interface} \\, dA\n$$\nTo proceed from this integral formulation to an algebraic expression, we must introduce several simplifying assumptions, as required by the problem statement.\n\n**Mechanical and Geometric Assumptions:**\n1.  **Geometric Simplification:** The complex geometry of the screw threads is modeled as a simple, smooth cylinder with an effective diameter $d$ and an embedded length $L$. This is a significant simplification, as actual screw threads provide mechanical interlock, which is a different resistance mechanism.\n2.  **Uniform Shear Stress:** The interfacial shear traction, $\\tau_{interface}$, is assumed to be distributed uniformly over the entire embedded cylindrical surface. In reality, stress concentrations would exist, and the distribution would be non-uniform.\n3.  **Ideal Shear Failure:** Failure is assumed to occur when the uniform shear traction simultaneously reaches the constant interfacial shear strength, $\\tau$, across the entire surface. Therefore, at the point of pullout, we have $\\tau_{interface} = \\tau$.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the constant shear strength $\\tau$ can be taken outside the integral:\n$$\nF_{pullout} = \\tau \\int_{A_{shear}} \\, dA\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{A_{shear}} \\, dA$ simply evaluates to the total lateral surface area of the cylindrical model, $A_{shear}$. This area is calculated as the circumference of the cylinder's base multiplied by its embedded length:\n$$\nA_{shear} = (\\pi d) \\times L\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for the area back into the force equation yields the final analytical formula for the pullout force:\n$$\nF_{pullout} = \\tau \\pi d L\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value of the pullout force using the provided data:\n-   Embedded length, $L = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Effective shear diameter, $d = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\n-   Interface shear strength, $\\tau = 20\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n\nFor dimensional consistency, we must ensure all units are compatible. The stress unit Megapascal ($\\mathrm{MPa}$) can be converted to a unit based on Newtons ($\\mathrm{N}$) and millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$).\n$$\n1\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 1 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 1 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}^{2}}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, it follows that $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = (1000\\,\\mathrm{mm})^2 = 1 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and objectively formulated. The model of parallel springs is a standard and appropriate simplification in biomechanics for analyzing load sharing in plate-bone constructs under axial loading. All provided numerical values are physically realistic for the specified context. The problem requires a derivation from first principles, which is a legitimate and well-defined task.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying fundamental principles of mechanics: static equilibrium, compatibility of displacements, and the linear elastic constitutive law for springs.\n\nFirst, we establish the system's governing equations based on these principles.\n\n1.  **Static Equilibrium**: The external axial compressive load, $F$, applied to the construct is resisted by the internal forces generated within the plate and the bone. Let $F_p$ be the compressive force carried by the plate and $F_b$ be the compressive force carried by the bone. For the system to be in static equilibrium, the sum of these internal forces must balance the external load. This gives the equilibrium equation:\n    $$F = F_p + F_b$$\n\n2.  **Compatibility of Displacements**: The problem models the plate and bone as being in a parallel configuration. A defining characteristic of a parallel system is that all components undergo the same displacement. The problem defines the interfragmentary motion, $\\delta$, as the axial relative displacement across the fracture gap. Since both the plate and the bone span this gap, their axial compressions must be equal to each other and equal to $\\delta$. Let $\\delta_p$ be the displacement of the plate and $\\delta_b$ be the displacement of the bone. The compatibility condition is:\n    $$\\delta = \\delta_p = \\delta_b$$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Law (Linear Elasticity)**: The problem states that the plate and bone behave as linear elastic springs. The relationship between the force in a linear spring and its displacement is given by Hooke's Law. For the plate and bone, this relationship is defined by their respective axial stiffnesses, $k_p$ and $k_b$.\n    The force in the plate is:\n    $$F_p = k_p \\delta_p$$\n    The force in the bone is:\n    $$F_b = k_b \\delta_b$$\n\nNow, we combine these three fundamental relations to derive the governing equation for the interfragmentary motion, $\\delta$.\n\nWe substitute the compatibility condition ($\\delta_p = \\delta_b = \\delta$) into the constitutive equations:\n$$F_p = k_p \\delta$$\n$$F_b = k_b \\delta$$\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $F_p$ and $F_b$ into the static equilibrium equation:\n$$F = (k_p \\delta) + (k_b \\delta)$$\n\nThis equation relates the external load $F$ directly to the interfragmentary motion $\\delta$. We can factor out $\\delta$ to make this relationship more explicit:\n$$F = (k_p + k_b)\\delta$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the equivalent stiffness of the parallel construct is the sum of the individual stiffnesses, $k_{eq} = k_p + k_b$. As required, this result was derived from first principles and not assumed.\n\nTo find the interfragmentary motion $\\delta$, we rearrange the equation to solve for it:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{F}{k_p + k_b}$$\nThis is the governing relation for $\\delta$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta$ using the given data. First, we must ensure all units are consistent. The load $F$ is in Newtons (N), and the stiffnesses $k_p$ and $k_b$ are in kilonewtons per millimeter (kN/mm). We will convert the stiffnesses to N/mm using the given conversion $1 \\text{ kN} = 10^3 \\text{ N}$.\n\nGiven values:\n$F = 600 \\text{ N}$\n$k_p = 20 \\text{ kN/mm} = 20 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}$\n$k_b = 10 \\text{ kN/mm} = 10 \\times 10^3 \\text{ N/mm}$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the derived equation for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{20 \\times 10^3 + 10 \\times 10^3}$$\nThe units in the numerator are N and in the denominator are N/mm, so the resulting unit for $\\delta$ will be millimeters (mm), as required.\n\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{(20 + 10) \\times 10^3} = \\frac{600}{30 \\times 10^3}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{600}{30000} = \\frac{6}{300} = \\frac{2}{100}$$\n$$\\delta = 0.02$$\nThe numerical value for the interfragmentary motion is $0.02 \\text{ mm}$.",

Each beam has a length $L$, corresponding to the working length on one side of the fracture. The fixed end of the cantilever is at the innermost screw, and the free end is at the fracture line.\n\nThe total axial load on the construct is $F$. The problem states to model the loading as an \"end shear force\" on each cantilever. Due to the symmetry of the system, this force is distributed equally to the two beams.

A strain of $2.6\\%$ (at $L=10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) falls within this ideal window. In contrast, a strain of $20.8\\%$ (at $L=20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is generally considered excessive and risks disrupting the fragile healing tissues, potentially leading to the formation of fibrous tissue and resulting in a nonunion (failed healing).
