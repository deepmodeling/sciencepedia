Assume the stress response is governed by a Kelvin–Voigt constitutive relation, $\\sigma = E_0 \\,\\epsilon + \\eta \\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$, where $\\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress, $\\epsilon$ is the Green–Lagrange strain (approximated as engineering strain for small strains), and $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ is the strain rate.

All terms ($\\sigma$, $\\epsilon$, $\\dot{\\epsilon}$, $E_0$, $\\eta$) are clearly defined. The provided values are physically realistic for a ligament under high-rate loading, and the units are dimensionally consistent. The problem is well-posed, as all necessary information is provided to compute a unique value for the stress $\\sigma$. The qualitative part of the question is a standard exercise in interpreting viscoelastic models. The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe problem requires a two-part response: a quantitative calculation of peak stress and a qualitative explanation of the role of viscosity in failure mechanics.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of Peak Cauchy Stress**\n\nThe constitutive behavior of the ligament is described by the Kelvin–Voigt linear viscoelastic model. This model can be conceptualized as a purely elastic spring in parallel with a purely viscous dashpot. The total stress, $\\sigma$, is the sum of the stress in the elastic component, $\\sigma_E$, and the stress in the viscous component, $\\sigma_V$.\n\nThe governing equation is given as:\n$$\n\\sigma = E_0 \\,\\epsilon + \\eta \\,\\dot{\\epsilon}\n$$\nHere, the term $E_0 \\,\\epsilon$ represents the elastic stress component, which depends on the magnitude of the strain. The term $\\eta \\,\\dot{\\epsilon}$ represents the viscous stress component, which depends on the rate at which the strain is applied.\n\nThe problem provides all the necessary values to calculate the peak Cauchy stress at the specified instant:\n- Elastic modulus, $E_0 = 300~\\mathrm{MPa}$\n- Viscosity, $\\eta = 5~\\mathrm{MPa\\cdot s}$\n- Strain, $\\epsilon = 0.08$ (dimensionless)\n- Strain rate, $\\dot{\\epsilon} = 60~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nWe substitute these values directly into the constitutive equation. First, we calculate the elastic and viscous contributions to stress separately.\n\nThe elastic stress contribution is:\n$$\n\\sigma_E = E_0 \\,\\epsilon = (300~\\mathrm{MPa}) \\times (0.08) = 24~\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThe viscous stress contribution is:\n$$\n\\sigma_V = \\eta \\,\\dot{\\epsilon} = (5~\\mathrm{MPa\\cdot s}) \\times (60~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 300~\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\n\nThe total Cauchy stress, $\\sigma$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sigma_E + \\sigma_V = 24~\\mathrm{MPa} + 300~\\mathrm{MPa} = 324~\\mathrm{MPa}\n$$\nThe value $324$ is already expressed to three significant figures.\n\n**Part 2: Modification of Failure Margin**\n\nThe second part of the task is to explain, based on first principles, how the viscous term modifies the failure margin under high-rate loading compared to quasi-static loading.\n\nThe total stress is $\\sigma = E_0 \\epsilon + \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$. This equation reveals the rate-dependent nature of a viscoelastic material.\n\nUnder **quasi-static loading**, the process occurs infinitely slowly. Mathematically, this corresponds to the limit where the strain rate approaches zero, i.e., $\\dot{\\epsilon} \\to 0$. In this scenario, the viscous term $\\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$ vanishes, and the constitutive law simplifies to that of a purely elastic solid:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{static}} = E_0 \\epsilon\n$$\nFor a given strain $\\epsilon$, the stress in the material is determined solely by the elastic modulus $E_0$.\n\nUnder **high-rate loading**, as described in the problem, the strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}$ is large and positive. The viscous term $\\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$ is therefore also large and positive, since $\\eta > 0$. The total stress is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{dynamic}} = E_0 \\epsilon + \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}\n$$\nFor the *same magnitude of strain* $\\epsilon$, the stress in the material under dynamic loading is greater than the stress under static loading: $\\sigma_{\\text{dynamic}} > \\sigma_{\\text{static}}$.\n\nFailure of a material like a ligament is often initiated when the stress reaches a critical failure stress, $\\sigma_f$.\n- In a quasi-static test, the ligament would fail at a strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{static-fail}}$ such that $\\sigma_f = E_0 \\epsilon_{\\text{static-fail}}$.\n- In a high-rate test, the ligament fails at a strain $\\epsilon_{\\text{dynamic-fail}}$ such that $\\sigma_f = E_0 \\epsilon_{\\text{dynamic-fail}} + \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$.\n\nSince the stress $\\sigma$ is elevated at any given strain $\\epsilon$ due to the positive contribution of the viscous term $\\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$, the critical failure stress $\\sigma_f$ is reached at a *smaller* value of strain. Therefore, $\\epsilon_{\\text{dynamic-fail}} < \\epsilon_{\\text{static-fail}}$.\n\nIn conclusion, the viscous term $\\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}$ causes the material to behave as if it is stiffer and more brittle under high-rate loading. It increases the stress required to achieve a given strain, which in turn means the material reaches its ultimate tensile strength at a lower level of deformation. This **reduces the failure margin** in terms of allowable strain; the ligament can withstand less stretching before it ruptures when it is loaded quickly. The presence of the viscous term makes the material more susceptible to injury under rapid, high-impact loading conditions compared to slow, controlled loading.",

It provides a solvable mechanics problem relevant to the biomechanics of sports injuries. All necessary parameters are defined and quantified. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested: first, the derivation of the maximum pivoting torque; second, the justification for its transmission to the knee; and third, the numerical evaluation of the change in this torque.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Maximum Pivoting Torque**\n\nWe are tasked with finding the maximum pivoting torque, $T_{\\text{max}}$, that can be generated at the shoe-surface interface. The interface is modeled as a circular patch of radius $r_c$ with a uniform normal pressure $p$. The total vertical Ground Reaction Force is $N$.\n\nThe uniform pressure $p$ is the total normal force $N$ divided by the contact area $A = \\pi r_c^2$.\n$$p = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{N}{\\pi r_c^2}$$\nWe assume Coulomb friction, where the maximum local shear stress (frictional stress) $\\tau_{\\text{max}}$ at any point is proportional to the local normal pressure $p$ via the coefficient of static friction $\\mu$.\n$$\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\mu p$$\nTo find the total torque, we must integrate the moments produced by the frictional forces over the entire contact area. Consider a differential ring element of area $dA$ at a radial distance $r$ from the center of rotation. This ring has a radius $r$ and a differential width $dr$. The area of this ring is $dA = 2\\pi r \\, dr$.\n\nThe differential normal force $dN$ on this ring is:\n$$dN = p \\, dA = p (2\\pi r \\, dr)$$\nThe maximum frictional force $dF_f$ that can be generated by this elemental ring is:\n$$dF_f = \\mu \\, dN = \\mu p (2\\pi r \\, dr)$$\nThis frictional force acts tangentially to the ring, at a distance $r$ from the center of rotation. Therefore, the differential torque $dT$ generated by this ring is:\n$$dT = r \\, dF_f = r [\\mu p (2\\pi r \\, dr)] = 2\\pi \\mu p r^2 \\, dr$$\nTo find the total maximum torque $T_{\\text{max}}$, we integrate this differential torque $dT$ from the center ($r=0$) to the edge of the circular patch ($r=r_c$).\n$$T_{\\text{max}} = \\int_{0}^{r_c} dT = \\int_{0}^{r_c} 2\\pi \\mu p r^2 \\, dr$$\nSince $\\mu$ and $p$ are constant over the entire area, we can pull them out of the integral.\n$$T_{\\text{max}} = 2\\pi \\mu p \\int_{0}^{r_c} r^2 \\, dr$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$T_{\\text{max}} = 2\\pi \\mu p \\left[ \\frac{r^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{r_c} = 2\\pi \\mu p \\frac{r_c^3}{3}$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the pressure $p = N / (\\pi r_c^2)$ to express the torque in terms of the specified variables $N$, $\\mu$, and $r_c$.\n$$T_{\\text{max}} = 2\\pi \\mu \\left(\\frac{N}{\\pi r_c^2}\\right) \\frac{r_c^3}{3}$$\nSimplifying the expression by canceling terms ($\\pi$ and $r_c^2$):\n$$T_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\mu N r_c$$\nThis is the required expression for the maximum pivoting torque that can be supported at the shoe-surface interface.\n\n**Part 2: Justification of Torque Transmission to the Knee**\n\nThe problem states that the analysis is performed under quasi-static conditions, implying that the angular acceleration ($\\alpha$) of the lower limb about its long axis is negligible ($\\alpha \\approx 0$). We can analyze the rotational equilibrium of the shank-foot complex as a single rigid body.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law for rotation, the sum of external moments ($\\sum M$) about an axis is equal to the product of the moment of inertia ($I$) about that axis and the angular acceleration ($\\alpha$).\n$$\\sum M_{\\text{long axis}} = I \\alpha$$\nThe external moments acting on the shank-foot complex about its longitudinal axis are:\n1.  The pivoting torque exerted by the ground on the shoe, $T_{\\text{external}}$. This is the reaction to the torque exerted by the foot on the ground.\n2.  The internal rotation moment exerted by the femur on the tibia at the knee joint, $M_{\\text{knee, internal}}$. From the perspective of the shank-foot free body, this is an external moment applied at the knee.\n\nThe weight of the shank-foot complex acts through its center of mass, and assuming this lies on the long axis of rotation, its weight does not contribute a moment about this axis.\n\nSetting up the moment equilibrium equation about the long axis of the lower limb:\n$$M_{\\text{knee, internal}} - T_{\\text{external}} = I \\alpha$$\nHere, moments are defined as positive for internal rotation of the tibia. Under the quasi-static assumption, $\\alpha \\approx 0$, so the inertial term vanishes.\n$$M_{\\text{knee, internal}} - T_{\\text{external}} \\approx 0$$\n$$M_{\\text{knee, internal}} \\approx T_{\\text{external}}$$\nThis demonstrates that for the lower limb to pivot without significant angular acceleration, the external torque from the ground must be balanced by an equal and opposite internal moment generated at the knee by muscles, ligaments, and joint contact forces. The maximum external torque that the shoe-surface interface can sustain is $T_{\\text{max}}$. Consequently, the maximum internal knee rotation moment that can be induced by this mechanism is equal to $T_{\\text{max}}$.\n$$M_{\\text{knee, max}} = T_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{2}{3} \\mu N r_c$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe need to calculate the increase in the knee internal rotation moment, $\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}}$, when the coefficient of friction $\\mu$ increases from $\\mu_1 = 0.6$ to $\\mu_2 = 1.0$.\n\nFirst, calculate the normal force $N$ using the given parameters: $m = 78\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, and $\\beta = 2.5$.\n$$N = \\beta m g = (2.5)(78\\,\\mathrm{kg})(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) = 1912.95\\,\\mathrm{N}$$\nThe change in the maximum knee moment is the difference between the moments calculated at the two friction coefficients.\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}} = M_{\\text{knee, max}}(\\mu_2) - M_{\\text{knee, max}}(\\mu_1)$$\nUsing the derived formula:\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu_2 N r_c\\right) - \\left(\\frac{2}{3} \\mu_1 N r_c\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} N r_c (\\mu_2 - \\mu_1)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$N = 1912.95\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$r_c = 0.055\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\mu_1 = 0.6$\n$\\mu_2 = 1.0$\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{2}{3} (1912.95\\,\\mathrm{N}) (0.055\\,\\mathrm{m}) (1.0 - 0.6)$$\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{2}{3} (1912.95) (0.055) (0.4)\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m}$$\n$$\\Delta M_{\\text{knee}} \\approx (0.6666...)
