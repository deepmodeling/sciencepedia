            "problem": "A primary blast wave interacting with the human head generates a transient overpressure at the head’s surface. For a short positive phase in the near free field, a widely used first-order biomechanical approximation for the incident overpressure at the surface is a triangular waveform: the overpressure rises to a peak and then decays monotonically to ambient over a finite positive-phase duration. Assume the head is oriented such that the local blast incidence is approximately normal, and model the positive-phase overpressure as a linear decay in time from a peak at $t=0$ to zero at $t=t_a$. Specifically, let the incident overpressure at the head be described by $P(t)$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq t_a$, where $P(t)$ is the overpressure above ambient pressure and satisfies $P(0)=P_0$ and $P(t_a)=0$, with $P(t)$ varying linearly between these endpoints. The positive-phase impulse per unit area $I$ is defined as the time integral of the overpressure over the positive phase, $I=\\int_{0}^{t_a} P(t)\\,dt$, and the mean positive-phase overpressure $\\bar{P}$ is the time average of $P(t)$ over $[0,t_a]$, i.e., $\\bar{P}=\\frac{1}{t_a}\\int_{0}^{t_a} P(t)\\,dt$. Using the given parameters $P_0=200\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$ and $t_a=3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, derive $I$ and $\\bar{P}$ from first principles under the stated triangular-wave assumption. Express $I$ in $\\mathrm{kPa}\\cdot\\mathrm{ms}$ and $\\bar{P}$ in $\\mathrm{kPa}$. Provide the exact values; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The goal is to compute the positive-phase impulse per unit area and the mean positive-phase overpressure experienced by the head during the blast positive phase. We begin from the definitions of impulse and time average for a pressure history, which are grounded in fundamental mechanics: impulse per unit area is the time integral of pressure (overpressure, in this case), and the mean value over an interval is the integral divided by the interval length.\n\nBy the problem’s physical model, the positive-phase overpressure $P(t)$ is triangular: it starts at a peak $P_0$ at $t=0$ and decreases linearly to $0$ at $t=t_a$. A linear function interpolating between these two boundary values is\n$$\nP(t) = P_0\\left(1 - \\frac{t}{t_a}\\right), \\quad 0 \\leq t \\leq t_a.\n$$\nThis form encodes a constant rate of decay and is consistent with a first-order approximation to the positive phase near the head for short durations.

            "introduction": "Moving from a single event to comparative analysis, a critical challenge in blast research is relating the effects of different-sized explosions at varying distances. This practice introduces the powerful principle of Hopkinson-Cranz, or cube-root, scaling, which allows experimental data to be normalized through a \"scaled distance.\" Mastering this concept  is essential for designing experiments and interpreting field data, as it provides a robust framework for establishing dynamic similarity between seemingly disparate blast scenarios.",

            "problem": "A primary injury mechanism to the head and torso during blast exposure is the transmission of peak incident overpressure. Two free-field explosive tests are conducted in air under identical ambient conditions to investigate head and torso biomechanics under blast loading. In Scenario A, a spherical charge with trinitrotoluene (TNT) equivalence mass $W_1$ is detonated at a standoff distance $R_1$ from a standing subject. In Scenario B, a geometrically similar setup is used with a different TNT equivalence mass $W_2$ and standoff distance $R_2$. Assume both scenarios produce spherically expanding blast waves in air with comparable waveform shapes when appropriately scaled, and the human dimensions are small compared to $R_1$ and $R_2$ so that the head and torso can each be locally approximated by the incident overpressure at their respective positions without significant spatial variation across the body segments.\n\nStarting from first principles and well-tested similarity arguments for blast in air (dimensional analysis of explosions with fixed explosive type and ambient conditions), derive an appropriate scaled distance that collapses the blast field for charges of different TNT equivalence. Use this to compute the scaled distances for both scenarios and determine whether the peak incident overpressures expected at the head and torso in Scenario A and Scenario B should be similar under dynamic similarity.\n\nThe test parameters are:\n- Scenario A: $W_1 = 5.0~\\mathrm{kg}$ TNT equivalence, $R_1 = 5.00~\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Scenario B: $W_2 = 40.0~\\mathrm{kg}$ TNT equivalence, $R_2 = 10.00~\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nTasks:\n1. Using only fundamental similarity arguments for blast waves in air with fixed explosive type, construct the relevant scaled distance from $R$ and $W$ and explain its role in comparing peak incident overpressure across charges.\n2. Compute the scaled distances for Scenario A and Scenario B, expressed in $\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3}$.\n3. Report the ratio of the two scaled distances, $Z_2/Z_1$, as the final answer. Round your final ratio to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a unitless number.\n\nNote: You do not need to compute an absolute value of peak overpressure. Your assessment of similarity must be based solely on the equality (or near-equality) of the scaled distances, which control peak incident overpressure for dynamically similar free-field blasts. The final reported result must be the single number $Z_2/Z_1$ rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem lies in the principle of dynamic similarity for blast waves, often referred to as Hopkinson-Cranz or cube-root scaling. This principle allows for the comparison of blast effects from explosive charges of different sizes ($W$) at different standoff distances ($R$).\n\n**1. Derivation of the Scaled Distance**\n\nWe begin from first principles using dimensional analysis. The peak incident overpressure, $\\Delta P_{inc}$, at a distance $R$ from a detonation is a function of the energy released by the explosive, $E$, and the properties of the ambient medium (in this case, air). For a fixed medium under constant ambient conditions, the most relevant properties are the ambient pressure, $P_0$, and the ambient density, $\\rho_0$. Thus, we can write a functional relationship:\n\n$$ \\Delta P_{inc} = f(E, R, P_0, \\rho_0) $$\n\nThe dimensions of these quantities in terms of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$) are:\n- $[\\Delta P_{inc}] = [P_0] = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$ (Pressure)\n- $[E] = M L^2 T^{-2}$ (Energy)\n- $[R] = L$ (Length)\n- $[\\rho_0] = M L^{-3}$ (Density)\n\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, we can express the relationship using a set of dimensionless groups. A natural choice for the first dimensionless group is the normalized overpressure, $\\frac{\\Delta P_{inc}}{P_0}$.\n\nTo form a second dimensionless group, we must combine the remaining variables $E$, $R$, and $P_0$ (we can use $P_0$ as the repeating variable representing the fluid properties, as it shares dimensions with $\\Delta P_{inc}$). Let's find a combination of $E$ and $P_0$ that results in a quantity with the dimension of length, which can then be used to normalize $R$.\n\nThe ratio of energy to pressure has dimensions:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{E}{P_0}\\right] = \\frac{M L^2 T^{-2}}{M L^{-1} T^{-2}} = L^3 $$\nThis quantity has the dimension of volume. To obtain a characteristic length scale from the explosion's energy and the ambient pressure, we take the cube root:\n$$ \\left[\\left(\\frac{E}{P_0}\\right)^{1/3}\\right] = (L^3)^{1/3} = L $$\nWe can now form a second dimensionless group, often called the Sachs scaled distance, by dividing the standoff distance $R$ by this characteristic length:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\frac{R}{\\left(\\frac{E}{P_0}\\right)^{1/3}} $$\nThe functional relationship can now be expressed in dimensionless form:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P_{inc}}{P_0} = g\\left( \\frac{R}{\\left(\\frac{E}{P_0}\\right)^{1/3}} \\right) $$\nwhere $g$ is some universal function for the given explosive and medium.\n\nThe problem specifies the charge size in terms of TNT equivalence mass, $W$. The energy released, $E$, is directly proportional to this mass: $E = qW$, where $q$ is the specific energy of TNT (energy per unit mass). Substituting this into our dimensionless group gives:\n$$ \\Pi_2 = \\frac{R}{\\left(\\frac{qW}{P_0}\\right)^{1/3}} = \\frac{R}{W^{1/3}} \\left(\\frac{P_0}{q}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe problem states that the tests are conducted in air under identical ambient conditions and use the same explosive type (TNT equivalence). This means that $P_0$ and $q$ are constants across both scenarios. Consequently, the term $\\left(\\frac{P_0}{q}\\right)^{1/3}$ is a constant. For two scenarios to be dynamically similar, meaning they produce the same dimensionless overpressure $\\frac{\\Delta P_{inc}}{P_0}$, their corresponding value of $\\Pi_2$ must be identical. Since $\\left(\\frac{P_0}{q}\\right)^{1/3}$ is a constant factor, this condition simplifies to requiring that the quantity $Z = \\frac{R}{W^{1/3}}$ must be the same for both scenarios.\n\nThis parameter, $Z = \\frac{R}{W^{1/3}}$, is the Hopkinson-Cranz scaled distance. It is the relevant parameter that collapses blast data for peak incident overpressure from charges of different yields onto a single curve. Therefore, if two scenarios have the same scaled distance $Z$, they are expected to produce the same peak incident overpressure.\n\n**2. Computation of Scaled Distances**\n\nWe now compute the scaled distance for each scenario using the formula $Z = R/W^{1/3}$, with $R$ in meters and $W$ in kilograms, to obtain units of $\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3}$.\n\n**Scenario A:**\nGiven $W_1 = 5.0~\\mathrm{kg}$ and $R_1 = 5.00~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ Z_1 = \\frac{R_1}{W_1^{1/3}} = \\frac{5.00}{(5.0)^{1/3}}~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3} $$\nWe can rewrite this as $Z_1 = (5.0)^{1} \\cdot (5.0)^{-1/3} = (5.0)^{2/3}~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3}$.\nNumerically, $(5.0)^{1/3} \\approx 1.709976$, so:\n$$ Z_1 \\approx \\frac{5.00}{1.709976} \\approx 2.9240~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3} $$\n\n**Scenario B:**\nGiven $W_2 = 40.0~\\mathrm{kg}$ and $R_2 = 10.00~\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$ Z_2 = \\frac{R_2}{W_2^{1/3}} = \\frac{10.00}{(40.0)^{1/3}}~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3} $$\nWe can simplify the denominator: $(40.0)^{1/3} = (8 \\times 5.0)^{1/3} = 8^{1/3} \\times (5.0)^{1/3} = 2 \\times (5.0)^{1/3}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Z_2$:\n$$ Z_2 = \\frac{10.00}{2 \\times (5.0)^{1/3}} = \\frac{5.00}{(5.0)^{1/3}}~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3} $$\nThis is identical to the expression for $Z_1$.\nNumerically, $(40.0)^{1/3} \\approx 3.419952$, so:\n$$ Z_2 \\approx \\frac{10.00}{3.419952} \\approx 2.9240~\\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{kg}^{-1/3} $$\nAs $Z_1 = Z_2$, the peak incident overpressures at the target locations in Scenario A and Scenario B are expected to be the same, confirming dynamic similarity.\n\n**3. Computation of the Ratio $Z_2/Z_1$**\n\nThe final task is to compute the ratio of the two scaled distances, $Z_2/Z_1$.\nUsing the symbolic expressions derived above:\n$$ \\frac{Z_2}{Z_1} = \\frac{\\frac{R_2}{W_2^{1/3}}}{\\frac{R_1}{W_1^{1/3}}} = \\left(\\frac{R_2}{R_1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{W_1}{W_2}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\frac{Z_2}{Z_1} = \\left(\\frac{10.00}{5.00}\\right) \\left(\\frac{5.0}{40.0}\\right)^{1/3} = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe cube root of $\\frac{1}{8}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$, so:\n$$ \\frac{Z_2}{Z_1} = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1 $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures. An exact value of $1$ expressed to four significant figures is $1.000$.",

At this time, the strain rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = p_s b(bt-2)e^{-bt}\n$$\n$bt_{extr} = 250 \\times 0.001904 = 0.476$.\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt}(t_{extr}) = (1.50 \\times 10^5)(250)(0.476-2)e^{-0.476} \\approx -3.55 \\times 10^7\\ \\mathrm{Pa/s}\n$$\n$$\ng(t_{extr}) = -\\frac{1}{2.20 \\times 10^9} (-3.55 \\times 10^7) \\approx 0.01614\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we compare the magnitudes of the strain rate at the two extrema:\n$$\n|g(0)| \\approx |-0.13636|\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 0.13636\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n|g(t_{extr})| \\approx 0.01614\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe maximum magnitude of the volumetric strain rate occurs at $t=0$ and is $|-p_s/\\kappa| = p_s/\\kappa$.\n$$\n\\max_{t \\ge 0} \\left|\\frac{d\\varepsilon_v}{dt}(t)\\right| = \\frac{p_s}{\\kappa} = \\frac{1.50 \\times 10^5}{1.10 \\times 10^6} = \\frac{1.5}{11} \\approx 0.13636\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe maximum magnitude of the principal strain rate is therefore:\n$$\n\\max_{t \\ge 0}\\left|\\frac{d\\varepsilon_p}{dt}(t)\\right| = \\frac{1}{3} \\max_{t \\ge 0} \\left|\\frac{d\\varepsilon_v}{dt}(t)\\right| = \\frac{1}{3}\\frac{p_s}{\\kappa} \\approx \\frac{0.13636}{3} \\approx 0.0454545\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $0.04545\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\nThe final requested values are:\n1) Maximum magnitude of principal strain: $1.413 \\times 10^{-5}$\n2) Maximum magnitude of principal strain rate: $0.04545\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$",
