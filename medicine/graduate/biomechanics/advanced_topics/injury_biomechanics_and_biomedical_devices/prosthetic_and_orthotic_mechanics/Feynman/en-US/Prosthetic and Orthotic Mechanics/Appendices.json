It is scientifically grounded in the principles of rigid body dynamics applied to prosthetic biomechanics, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is expressed in objective, formal language. All data provided are physically plausible for the scenario described. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum friction torque, $\\tau_{f,\\min}$, required to ensure knee locking during a stumble event. The dynamics of the prosthetic shank-foot segment about the knee joint are governed by Newton's second law for rotation:\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = I \\alpha\n$$\nwhere $\\sum \\tau$ is the net torque about the knee axis, $I$ is the moment of inertia of the shank-foot segment about the knee axis, and $\\alpha$ is the angular acceleration of the segment.\n\nWe define the direction of knee flexion as the positive direction for angular motion. The problem states that the Ground Reaction Force (GRF) produces a flexion moment about the knee. Thus, the external moment, $M_{\\text{ext}}$, is positive. The friction-based stance lock produces a constant resistive torque, $\\tau_{f}$, which opposes flexion. Therefore, $\\tau_{f}$ acts in the negative (extension) direction.\n\nAccording to the problem, other moment contributions are negligible. The net torque is the sum of the external moment and the friction torque:\n$$\n\\sum \\tau = M_{\\text{ext}} - \\tau_{f}\n$$\nSubstituting this into Newton's second law gives the equation of motion for the knee joint:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ext}} - \\tau_{f} = I \\alpha\n$$\nThe condition for \"locking\" is defined as ensuring non-positive angular acceleration at the instant of peak flexion moment. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\alpha \\le 0\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the knee joint's flexion will not accelerate, preventing collapse. Substituting this condition into the equation of motion yields:\n$$\nM_{\\text{ext}} - \\tau_{f} \\le I \\times 0\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\text{ext}} - \\tau_{f} \\le 0\n$$\nTo guarantee locking, the friction torque $\\tau_{f}$ must be at least as large as the external flexion moment $M_{\\text{ext}}$.

            "problem": "A prosthetic ankle-foot module is being designed to emulate the quasi-static torque–angle behavior of a biological ankle during mid-stance. Over a small dorsiflexion range, the target ankle moment–angle relationship is experimentally fit by the cubic function $M_{\\text{target}}(\\theta) = A \\theta + B \\theta^{3}$, where $\\theta$ is the ankle dorsiflexion angle in radians, $A = 215\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/rad}$, and $B = 1620\\,\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m/rad}^3$.

Using this connection and the requirement to match the instantaneous slope of $M_{\\text{target}}(\\theta)$ at $\\theta^{\\ast}$, compute the required rotational stiffness $k_{\\theta}$ of the ankle module.\n\nExpress the final rotational stiffness in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m/rad}$ and round your answer to four significant figures. The angle unit is radians.",
            "solution": "The problem presents two distinct tasks. First, to derive the relationship between the rotational stiffness $k_{\\theta}$ of the ankle module, the linear stiffness $k$ of its keel, and the effective radius $r$. Second, to compute the specific value of $k_{\\theta}$ required for a prosthetic design to match the instantaneous stiffness of a target biological ankle at a given operating angle $\\theta^{\\ast}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between $k_{\\theta}$, $k$, and $r$ starting from the specified first principles.\n\n1.  **Hooke's Law for Linear Elasticity**: The keel is modeled as a linear spring. A restoring force $F$ is generated in response to a linear displacement $s$. According to Hooke's Law, the magnitude of this force is proportional to the displacement:\n    $$F = k s$$\n    where $k$ is the linear stiffness of the keel.\n\n2.  **Newton's Laws and Definition of Moment**: The force $F$ is applied at an effective radius $r$ from the ankle joint's center of rotation. A moment (or torque), $M$, is the rotational equivalent of force. From mechanics, the magnitude of the moment generated by a force applied perpendicularly to a lever arm is the product of the force and the lever arm length. The problem states to assume a constant moment arm equal to the effective radius $r$. Thus, the magnitude of the restoring moment is:\n    $$M = F r$$\n\n3.  **Geometry of Circular Motion**: The keel is idealized as a segment of a circle of radius $r$. For a small angular deflection $\\theta$ (in radians), the corresponding linear displacement along the arc, $s$, is given by:\n    $$s = r \\theta$$\n\nBy combining these three principles, we can express the ankle moment $M$ as a function of the ankle angle $\\theta$. We substitute the expression for $F$ from Hooke's Law into the moment equation:\n$$M = (k s) r$$\nNext, we substitute the geometric relation for $s$:\n$$M = k (r \\theta) r$$\nRearranging the terms, we find the relationship between moment and angle for the idealized prosthetic module:\n$$M = (k r^2) \\theta$$\nThis equation is in the form $M = k_{\\theta} \\theta$, which describes a linear torsional spring, where $k_{\\theta}$ is the rotational stiffness. By comparing the two forms, we identify the expression for the rotational stiffness:\n$$k_{\\theta} = k r^2$$\nThis completes the requested derivation.\n\nNext, we address the second task: to compute the required rotational stiffness $k_{\\theta}$ for the prosthetic design.

The units are consistent (SI).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with deriving the solution from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of Margin of Stability (MoS)\n\nThe Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) is used to analyze the dynamics of the Center of Mass (COM). In this model, the body is simplified to a point mass $m$ at a constant height $z_0$ above the ground, pivoting about a point on the ground called the Center of Pressure (CoP), located at position $x_{CoP}$.\n\nThe horizontal motion of the COM is governed by Newton's second law, $F_x = m\\ddot{x}$. The horizontal ground reaction force, $F_x$, can be related to the body's geometry. Assuming small angles, the ratio of the horizontal force $F_x$ to the vertical force $F_z$ (which equals $mg$ for balance) is equal to the ratio of the horizontal displacement of the COM from the CoP to the COM height:\n$$ \\frac{F_x}{F_z} = \\frac{x - x_{CoP}}{z_0} $$\nSubstituting $F_x = m\\ddot{x}$ and $F_z = mg$:\n$$ \\frac{m\\ddot{x}}{mg} = \\frac{x - x_{CoP}}{z_0} $$\nThis simplifies to the fundamental equation of motion for the LIPM:\n$$ \\ddot{x} = \\frac{g}{z_0} (x - x_{CoP}) $$\nWe can define the natural frequency of the inverted pendulum as $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{g/z_0}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\ddot{x} = \\omega_0^2 (x - x_{CoP}) $$\nTo maintain balance, the CoP must be actively controlled within the Base of Support (BoS). A critical concept for assessing dynamic stability is the Extrapolated Center of Mass (XCoM), denoted here as $x_{XCoM}$. The XCoM represents the position on the ground where the CoP must be placed to bring the body to a complete halt (i.e., to stop the COM's forward momentum). It is a quantity that combines the COM's position and velocity into a single spatial metric.\n\nThe XCoM is defined as:\n$$ x_{XCoM} = x + \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\omega_0} $$\nDynamic stability is maintained as long as this required CoP location, $x_{XCoM}$, lies within the anatomical BoS.\n\nThe Margin of Stability (MoS) is the signed distance from the edge of the BoS to the XCoM. For the anterior direction, the boundary is at $x_{\\text{edge}}$. A positive MoS indicates that the XCoM is within the BoS, signifying stability. A negative MoS indicates that the XCoM is outside the BoS, signifying that a corrective action (e.g., taking a step) is necessary to avoid falling. The definition is:\n$$ \\text{MoS} = x_{\\text{edge}} - x_{XCoM} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nFirst, we calculate the natural frequency $\\omega_0$:\n$$ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{z_0}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9.81\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}}{0.95\\,\\mathrm{m}}} \\approx \\sqrt{10.3263\\,\\mathrm{s^{-2}}} \\approx 3.21346\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the position of the Extrapolated Center of Mass, $x_{XCoM}$:\n$$ x_{XCoM} = x + \\frac{\\dot{x}}{\\omega_0} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m} + \\frac{0.80\\,\\mathrm{m/s}}{3.21346\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 0.12\\,\\mathrm{m} + 0.24895\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.36895\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n\nFinally, we calculate the Margin of Stability, MoS:\n$$ \\text{MoS} = x_{\\text{edge}} - x_{XCoM} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.36895\\,\\mathrm{m} = -0.16895\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\text{MoS} \\approx -0.169\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $\\text{MoS}$ is the signed distance from the anterior BoS edge to the extrapolated center of mass, $\\text{MoS} = x_{\\text{edge}} - x_{\\text{XCoM}}$, where $x_{\\text{XCoM}}$ is defined by the dynamically consistent manifold for the LIPM; numerically, $\\text{MoS} \\approx -0.169\\,\\mathrm{m}$.**\n- **Definition:** The definition $\\text{MoS} = x_{\\text{edge}} - x_{\\text{XCoM}}$ is correct.

This is inconsistent with the problem's premise of using the LIPM for dynamic analysis. Furthermore, the sign convention is reversed from the standard definition.\n- **Numerical Value:** The calculation $0.12\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m} = -0.080\\,\\mathrm{m}$ is arithmetically correct for the flawed formula.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.
