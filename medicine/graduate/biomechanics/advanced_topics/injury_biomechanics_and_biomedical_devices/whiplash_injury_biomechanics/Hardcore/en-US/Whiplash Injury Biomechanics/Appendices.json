            "problem": "A simplified sagittal-plane model is used to estimate the peak inertial shear force transmitted at the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) during the early phase of a rear-impact acceleration.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the peak horizontal inertial shear force at the C7/T1 joint. We model the head as a rigid body and apply Newton's second law in the horizontal direction.\n\nAccording to Newton's second law, the sum of the external forces in a given direction equals the product of the body's mass and the acceleration of its center of mass (CM) in that direction. For the horizontal ($x$) direction, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sum F_{x} = m_h \\cdot a_{h,x}\n$$\nHere, $\\sum F_{x}$ is the sum of external horizontal forces on the head, $m_h$ is the mass of the head, and $a_{h,x}$ is the horizontal acceleration of the head's center of mass.\n\nThe only external horizontal force acting on the head is the shear force, $F_{shear}$, from the neck at the C7/T1 joint. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n$$\nF_{shear} = m_h \\cdot a_{h,x}\n$$\nTo find the peak shear force, we must determine the peak horizontal acceleration of the head's CM, $a_{h,x}$.\n\nThe motion of the head's CM (point G) can be related to the motion of the C7/T1 joint (point P) using the principles of rigid body kinematics. The acceleration of the base (T1) is given as a horizontal acceleration, $a_b$, so the acceleration of the joint P is $\\vec{a}_P = a_b \\hat{i}$. The general formula for the acceleration of the head's CM is:\n$$\n\\vec{a}_G = \\vec{a}_P + \\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{G/P} - \\omega^2 \\vec{r}_{G/P}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{\\alpha}$ is the angular acceleration of the head, $\\vec{\\omega}$ is the angular velocity of the head, and $\\vec{r}_{G/P}$ is the position vector from the joint P to the CM G.\n\nThe problem provides two critical simplifying assumptions for the instant of peak base acceleration:\n1.  \"the head’s angular velocity is small\": This allows us to neglect the centripetal acceleration term, $- \\omega^2 \\vec{r}_{G/P}$.\n2.  \"the angular acceleration contribution to the net shear is negligible compared to the translational inertial contribution\": The total shear force is $F_{shear} = m_h a_{h,x}$. The term $m_h (\\vec{\\alpha} \\times \\vec{r}_{G/P})_x$ represents the contribution to this shear force from angular acceleration. The problem explicitly instructs us to neglect this term. The \"translational inertial contribution\" refers to the force associated with the base's acceleration, $m_h a_b$.\n\nApplying these two assumptions to the kinematic equation for the horizontal component of acceleration, $a_{h,x}$, we get:\n$$\na_{h,x} \\approx a_{P,x} = a_b\n$$\nThus, the horizontal acceleration of the head's center of mass is approximately equal to the horizontal acceleration of the base.\n\nThe peak shear force, $F_{shear,peak}$, occurs at the instant of peak base acceleration, $a_{b,peak}$. We can now calculate this force:\n$$\nF_{shear,peak} \\approx m_h \\cdot a_{b,peak}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following values:\n- Head mass, $m_h = 4.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Peak base acceleration, $a_{b,peak} = 6\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$\nF_{shear,peak} = (4.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}) \\times (6\\,\\mathrm{m/s^2}) = 27\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nF_{shear,peak} = 27.0\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\nThe information regarding the mass moment of inertia ($I_h = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\cdot m^2}$) and the horizontal offset ($0.08\\,\\mathrm{m}$) is not required for this calculation due to the simplifying assumptions. These values would be necessary for a more detailed analysis, such as finding the angular acceleration $\\alpha$ or the bending moment at the joint, but they are extraneous to the specific question asked.",

            "problem": "A cervical Functional Spinal Unit (FSU) subjected to whiplash-like extension can be idealized, for small deformations, as a rigid superior vertebra connected to the inferior vertebra by two linear elastic elements acting in parallel: a central intervertebral disc spring and a posterior facet contact spring. The intervertebral disc is modeled as a linear axial spring of stiffness $k_{d}$ located at the centroid of the disc ($x=0$). The facet contact is modeled as a linear spring of normal stiffness $k_{f}$ located at a posterior offset $x=d$ along the sagittal plane. The FSU experiences an externally applied compressive preload $F_{c}$ along the disc centroid line and a pure extension moment $M$ about that line. Assume quasi-static equilibrium, small rotations, and that both springs can carry compression or tension.\n\nStarting only from Newton’s laws for force and moment equilibrium, and linear elasticity (Hooke’s law), derive the internal disc force $F_{d}$ and facet force $F_{f}$ consistent with rigid-body kinematics (uniform vertical translation and small rotation of the superior vertebra). Then, using those internal forces, compute the facet load share defined as the dimensionless quantity $s = F_{f}/F_{c}$ for the given parameters $M = 8\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$, $F_{c} = 150\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $d = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, $k_{d} = 5000\\,\\mathrm{N/mm}$, and $k_{f} = 12000\\,\\mathrm{N/mm}$.\n\nExpress the final answer as a pure number (no units) and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The modeling assumptions imply the superior vertebra behaves as a rigid body undergoing a small vertical translation and a small rotation relative to the inferior vertebra. Let the vertical translation be denoted by $\\Delta$ and the small rotation (about the disc centroid line) by $\\theta$. With the disc spring located at $x=0$ and the facet spring at $x=d$ posteriorly, the vertical compressions (positive in compression) of the disc and facet springs, respectively, are given by the rigid-body kinematics:\n$$\n\\delta_{d} = \\Delta, \\qquad \\delta_{f} = \\Delta + \\theta d.\n$$\nBy linear elasticity (Hooke’s law), the internal forces in the springs are\n$$\nF_{d} = k_{d}\\,\\delta_{d} = k_{d}\\,\\Delta, \\qquad F_{f} = k_{f}\\,\\delta_{f} = k_{f}\\,(\\Delta + \\theta d).\n$$\n\nForce and moment equilibrium are enforced relative to the disc centroid line. The net external compressive preload is $F_{c}$, so the sum of internal vertical forces must satisfy:\n$$\nF_{d} + F_{f} = F_{c}.\n$$\nThe externally applied pure extension moment about the disc centroid is $M$. The disc force acts at $x=0$ and therefore does not contribute to a moment about the disc centroid line, while the facet force acts at $x=d$. Thus, the moment equilibrium is:\n$$\nF_{f}\\,d = M.\n$$\n\nFrom the moment equilibrium,\n$$\nF_{f} = \\frac{M}{d}.\n$$\nSubstituting into the force equilibrium gives the disc force:\n$$\nF_{d} = F_{c} - F_{f} = F_{c} - \\frac{M}{d}.\n$$\n\nThese expressions for $F_{d}$ and $F_{f}$ are independent of stiffness; the stiffnesses $k_{d}$ and $k_{f}$ determine the kinematics $\\Delta$ and $\\theta$ necessary to realize these forces. Specifically, using Hooke’s law and the kinematic relations,\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{F_{d}}{k_{d}} = \\frac{F_{c} - \\frac{M}{d}}{k_{d}}, \\qquad \\theta = \\frac{1}{d}\\left(\\frac{F_{f}}{k_{f}} - \\Delta\\right) = \\frac{1}{d}\\left(\\frac{\\frac{M}{d}}{k_{f}} - \\frac{F_{c} - \\frac{M}{d}}{k_{d}}\\right).\n$$\nHowever, the requested quantity is the facet load share defined as $s = F_{f}/F_{c}$. Using the equilibrium-derived force,\n$$\ns = \\frac{F_{f}}{F_{c}} = \\frac{\\frac{M}{d}}{F_{c}} = \\frac{M}{d\\,F_{c}}.\n$$\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values, converting $d$ to meters consistently or noting that $M/d$ is a force when $M$ is in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and $d$ in meters.

This reflects realistic extension scenarios in whiplash where posterior structures bear high compressive loads while the disc experiences distraction.",
