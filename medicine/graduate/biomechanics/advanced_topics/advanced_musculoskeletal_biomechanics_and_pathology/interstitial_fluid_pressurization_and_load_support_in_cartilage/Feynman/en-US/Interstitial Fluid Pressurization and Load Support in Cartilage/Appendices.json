This pressure is sustained because the fluid can only escape slowly through the dense, porous solid matrix. This exercise  provides a fundamental look at this process by deriving Darcy's law from first principles and calculating a realistic fluid flux. By working through this problem, you will gain a quantitative understanding of how material properties like permeability ($k$) and fluid viscosity ($\\mu$) dictate the tissue's primary load-bearing function.",

Fluid inertia is non-negligible at $t = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ due to the finite viscosity $\\mu$, which makes $\\mu/k$ small, so the Darcy drag is weak; thus fluid inertia dominates at millisecond impacts, while solid inertia remains negligible up to $f = 1\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$.**\n    - Our calculation for $t=1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ gives $\\Pi_f = 10^{-6}$, which is negligible. Fluid inertia absolutely does not dominate.\n    - The reasoning is factually wrong: the drag coefficient $\\mu/k = (10^{-3})/(10^{-15}) = 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot s/m^4}$ is an extremely large number, signifying that Darcy drag is very strong, not weak.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n*   **D. Inertial effects are negligible only when the tissue thickness $h$ is large; for thin cartilage ($h \\approx 2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), solid inertia becomes important even at $f = 1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, and fluid inertia can dominate for quasi-static ramps because small $h$ reduces Darcy drag sufficiently to amplify transient fluid acceleration.**\n    - The solid inertia ratio, $\\Pi_s \\sim \\frac{\\rho_s h^2}{H_A T^2}$, is proportional to $h^2$. This means solid inertial effects are *more* significant in thicker samples, not less. The statement is the opposite of the physical scaling.\n    - Our calculation shows solid inertia is negligible at $f=1\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    - The fluid inertia ratio, $\\Pi_f$, is independent of $h$ in this analysis. Darcy drag itself is not directly dependent on $h$ in this formulation of the ratio.\n    - **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, Option A is the only one that provides a scientifically correct and quantitatively consistent description of the role of inertia in cartilage biomechanics across the specified loading regimes.",
