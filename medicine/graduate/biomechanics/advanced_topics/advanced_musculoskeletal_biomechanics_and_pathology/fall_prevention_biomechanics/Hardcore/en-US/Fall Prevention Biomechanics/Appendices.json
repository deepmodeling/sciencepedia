            "problem": "A human subject stands quietly with both feet flat on level ground. Model the whole body above the ankles as a single rigid segment that can rotate in the sagittal plane about the ankle joints without foot lift-off. The foot is modeled as a rigid support of length $L$ from heel to toe, with the ankle joint center located a distance $a$ anterior to the heel ($0aL$). The Center of Mass (COM) of the whole body relative to the ankle joint, in the initial upright posture ($\\theta=0$), has horizontal offset $x_0$ (positive anterior) and vertical height $h$ (positive upward), with $h0$ and $-a \\le x_0 \\le L-a$. Assume high friction with the ground so that slip does not occur and the Base of Support (BoS) is the line segment from heel to toe.\n\nThe subject leans forward by an angle $\\theta$ (positive for anterior lean) through rigid rotation about the ankle joint, while maintaining static equilibrium (no linear or angular acceleration). Using Newton’s laws and moment balance for rigid bodies in static equilibrium, derive how the vertical line of action of the gravitational force through the COM projects onto the ground relative to the ankle as a function of $\\theta$. Then, using the requirement for static stability that the resultant ground reaction line of action must lie within the BoS, compute the maximum allowable forward-lean angle $\\theta_{\\max}$ at which static stability is just maintained before loss of stability at the toe. Express your final answer for $\\theta_{\\max}$ in radians. No numerical evaluation is required; provide a closed-form analytic expression.",
            "solution": "We establish a coordinate system with the origin $(0,0)$ at the center of the ankle joint. The $x$-axis points horizontally forward (anteriorly), and the $y$-axis points vertically upward.\n\nIn the initial upright posture ($\\theta=0$), the Center of Mass (COM) is at coordinates $(x_0, h)$. When the subject leans forward by an angle $\\theta$, the body rotates as a rigid segment around the ankle joint. This corresponds to a clockwise rotation in our coordinate system. The new coordinates of the COM, $(x_{\\text{COM}}, y_{\\text{COM}})$, are found by applying the rotation transformation:\n$$x_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = x_0 \\cos\\theta + h \\sin\\theta$$\n$$y_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = -x_0 \\sin\\theta + h \\cos\\theta$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, the net force and net moment on the system must be zero. This requires the upward ground reaction force (GRF) to be equal, opposite, and collinear to the downward force of gravity. Therefore, the horizontal position of the Center of Pressure (CoP), where the resultant GRF acts, must be identical to the horizontal position of the COM. The projection of the gravitational force line of action onto the ground relative to the ankle is thus:\n$$x_{\\text{proj}}(\\theta) = x_{\\text{COM}}(\\theta) = x_0 \\cos\\theta + h \\sin\\theta$$\n\nStatic stability requires the CoP to lie within the Base of Support (BoS). The BoS extends from the heel at $x=-a$ to the toe at $x=L-a$. The stability condition is:\n$$-a \\le x_{\\text{CoP}}(\\theta) \\le L-a$$\nThe maximum forward-lean angle, $\\theta_{\\max}$, occurs when the CoP reaches the anterior boundary of the BoS (the toe):\n$$x_{\\text{CoP}}(\\theta_{\\max}) = L-a$$\n$$x_0 \\cos\\theta_{\\max} + h \\sin\\theta_{\\max} = L-a$$\n\nTo solve for $\\theta_{\\max}$, we use the R-formula method.

The equation becomes:\n$$R \\left( \\frac{h}{R} \\sin\\theta_{\\max} + \\frac{x_0}{R} \\cos\\theta_{\\max} \\right) = L-a$$\nDefine an auxiliary angle $\\beta = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_0}{h}\\right)$, such that $\\cos\\beta = \\frac{h}{R}$ and $\\sin\\beta = \\frac{x_0}{R}$. Using the sine addition identity, $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$R \\sin(\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta) = L-a$$\nSolving for $\\theta_{\\max}$:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta) = \\frac{L-a}{R} = \\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}$$\n$$\\theta_{\\max} + \\beta = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right)$$\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right) - \\beta$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\beta$ yields the final answer:\n$$\\theta_{\\max} = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{L-a}{\\sqrt{x_0^2 + h^2}}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{x_0}{h}\\right)$$",

            "problem": "A human subject is modeled as a point-mass Center of Mass (COM) attached to a massless leg with an ankle pivot at a fixed ground support point, forming the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM). The COM moves in the horizontal forward-backward direction with coordinate $x(t)$ relative to the current stance ankle at $x=0$, and the COM height is held approximately constant at $z_0$. The subject experiences a backward push at time $t=0$ that instantaneously imparts a backward COM velocity $\\dot{x}(0)0$ while leaving the stance location unchanged. The gravitational acceleration is $g$ and the stance foot is initially at $u=0$.\n\nStarting directly from Newton’s second law and the geometric constraint of the LIPM, derive the expression for the posterior capture point defined as the unique backward foot placement location $u_{\\mathrm{cap}}$ such that, if the foot is instantaneously placed there at $t=0$, the COM can come to rest above the new base of support without requiring additional steps.

The ankle pivot is at a horizontal location $u$. The horizontal component of the ground reaction force, $F_x$, creates the horizontal acceleration, $m\\ddot{x} = F_x$. In the LIPM, the vertical force balances gravity, $F_y = mg$. The ratio of the forces is determined by the geometry: $\\frac{F_x}{F_y} = \\frac{x-u}{z_0}$.
