This exercise provides a practical application of the impulse-momentum theorem by using realistic, albeit simplified, mathematical models for the force profiles during the takeoff and landing phases of a vertical jump . By working through this problem, you will solidify your ability to calculate the change in momentum from time-varying forces and understand how propulsive and impact impulses are fundamentally linked.",

            "problem": "An athlete of mass $m$ performs a purely vertical countermovement jump from rest and lands on the same level surface, with negligible air resistance. The vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) during propulsion is approximated by a half-sine superimposed on body weight for $t \\in [0, T]$:\n$$F_{z}^{\\text{takeoff}}(t) = m g + A \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right),$$\nwith $F_{z}^{\\text{takeoff}}(t) = 0$ for $t > T$. After a ballistic flight, the vGRF during landing is approximated over the entire contact interval $t \\in [0, t_c]$ by a raised-cosine above body weight,\n$$F_{z}^{\\text{land}}(t) = m g + B \\left[1 - \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{t_c}\\right)\\right],$$\nwith $F_{z}^{\\text{land}}(t) = 0$ for $t > t_c$. Assume the center of mass is a point mass and that the only vertical forces are gravity and the vGRF during the contact intervals.\n\nUsing only first principles from mechanics, determine the amplitude $B$ required so that the vertical center-of-mass velocity at the end of landing contact is exactly zero (no rebound).

Express your final answer for $B$ in newtons and round to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the amplitude $B$ for the landing ground reaction force model. The condition is that the athlete's center of mass (COM) comes to a complete stop at the end of the landing phase. This problem can be solved by applying the impulse-momentum theorem, which states that the net impulse on an object is equal to the change in its momentum ($J_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta p$). We will apply this principle separately to the takeoff and landing phases.\n\nFirst, we analyze the takeoff phase, which occurs over the time interval $t \\in [0, T]$. The athlete starts from rest, so the initial vertical velocity of the COM is $v_{z}(0) = 0$. The net vertical force acting on the athlete, $F_{\\text{net,TO}}(t)$, is the difference between the vertical ground reaction force, $F_{z}^{\\text{takeoff}}(t)$, and the force of gravity, $mg$.\n$$F_{\\text{net,TO}}(t) = F_{z}^{\\text{takeoff}}(t) - mg = \\left(m g + A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) - mg = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right)$$\nThe net impulse during takeoff, $J_{\\text{TO}}$, is the time integral of this net force from $t=0$ to $t=T$.\n$$J_{\\text{TO}} = \\int_{0}^{T} F_{\\text{net,TO}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} A \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right) \\, dt$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$J_{\\text{TO}} = A \\left[-\\frac{T}{\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{T} = -\\frac{AT}{\\pi} \\left(\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0)\\right) = -\\frac{AT}{\\pi}(-1 - 1) = \\frac{2AT}{\\pi}$$\nThis impulse equals the change in momentum during takeoff, $\\Delta p_{\\text{TO}} = m v_T - m v_z(0)$, where $v_T$ is the velocity at the instant of liftoff ($t=T$). Since $v_z(0)=0$, we have $\\Delta p_{\\text{TO}} = m v_T$.\nEquating the impulse and the change in momentum:\n$$m v_T = \\frac{2AT}{\\pi}$$\nThe liftoff velocity is therefore $v_T = \\frac{2AT}{m\\pi}$.\n\nSecond, we consider the ballistic flight phase. The problem states that the athlete lands on the same level surface and air resistance is negligible. By conservation of mechanical energy (or by the symmetry of projectile motion under constant gravity), the velocity of the COM upon touchdown, $v_{TD}$, is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the liftoff velocity $v_T$.\n$$v_{TD} = -v_T = -\\frac{2AT}{m\\pi}$$\nThis velocity is the initial condition for the landing phase.\n\nThird, we analyze the landing phase, which occurs over a contact time $t_c$. To avoid ambiguity, we can use a new time variable $t'$ for this phase, where $t' \\in [0, t_c]$. The initial velocity is $v_{TD}$, and the final velocity is stipulated to be zero, $v_f = 0$. The net vertical force during landing, $F_{\\text{net,L}}(t')$, is:\n$$F_{\\text{net,L}}(t') = F_{z}^{\\text{land}}(t') - mg = \\left(m g + B \\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t'}{t_c}\\right)\\right]\\right) - mg = B \\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t'}{t_c}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe net impulse during landing, $J_{\\text{L}}$, is the integral of this net force from $t'=0$ to $t'=t_c$.\n$$J_{\\text{L}} = \\int_{0}^{t_c} F_{\\text{net,L}}(t') \\, dt' = \\int_{0}^{t_c} B \\left[1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t'}{t_c}\\right)\\right] \\, dt'$$\nEvaluating this integral yields:\n$$J_{\\text{L}} = B \\left[t' - \\frac{t_c}{2\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t'}{t_c}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{t_c} = B \\left[\\left(t_c - \\frac{t_c}{2\\pi} \\sin(2\\pi)\\right) - \\left(0 - \\frac{t_c}{2\\pi} \\sin(0)\\right)\\right] = B t_c$$\nThis landing impulse must be equal to the change in momentum during the landing phase, $\\Delta p_{\\text{L}} = m v_f - m v_{TD}$.\n$$\\Delta p_{\\text{L}} = m(0) - m v_{TD} = -m \\left(-\\frac{2AT}{m\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{2AT}{\\pi}$$\nBy equating the landing impulse $J_{\\text{L}}$ with the change in momentum $\\Delta p_{\\text{L}}$:\n$$B t_c = \\frac{2AT}{\\pi}$$\nFinally, we solve for the amplitude $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{2AT}{\\pi t_c}$$\nThe problem provides the values $m = 75\\,\\text{kg}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$, $T = 0.30\\,\\text{s}$, $t_c = 0.20\\,\\text{s}$, and $A = 1.5\\, m g$. We can first substitute the expression for $A$ into our formula for $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{2 (1.5 mg) T}{\\pi t_c} = \\frac{3mgT}{\\pi t_c}$$\nNow, we can substitute the numerical values:\n$$B = \\frac{3 \\times (75) \\times (9.81) \\times (0.30)}{\\pi \\times (0.20)}$$\n$$B = \\frac{662.175}{0.20\\pi} = \\frac{3310.875}{\\pi} \\approx 1053.9452\\,\\text{N}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The fourth significant digit is $3$, so we round down.\n$$B \\approx 1050\\,\\text{N}$$\nIn standard scientific notation, this is $1.05 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{N}$.",

            "problem": "A planar jump is modeled as a point-mass Center of Mass (COM) acted upon by a single resultant Ground Reaction Force (GRF) impulse during takeoff, followed by flight under uniform gravity and a level-ground landing at the same height as takeoff. The jumper of mass $m$ applies a resultant takeoff impulse vector $\\mathbf{J} = (J_{x}, J_{z})$ over a short stance, changing the COM velocity from rest to $\\mathbf{v}_{0} = \\mathbf{J}/m$. The foot–ground interface obeys Coulomb friction with coefficient of friction $\\mu$, so that the time-integrated friction cone holds: $|J_{x}| \\leq \\mu J_{z}$ during takeoff. Forward jumping is considered, with $J_{x} \\geq 0$ and $J_{z} \\geq 0$. The jumper can scale the impulse magnitude but cannot exceed a resultant amplitude $|\\mathbf{J}| \\leq J_{\\max}$.\n\nTo avoid excessive landing loads, the vertical component of COM velocity at the instant of landing contact must not exceed $v_{z,\\max}$ in magnitude. Neglect air resistance and assume equal takeoff and landing heights, so the vertical speed at landing equals the takeoff vertical speed in magnitude. Gravity is uniform with magnitude $g$.\n\nThe jumper seeks to maximize horizontal flight distance by choosing the takeoff direction (angle $\\theta$ of $\\mathbf{v}_{0}$ relative to the horizontal) and the impulse magnitude, subject to the friction cone, the impulse bound $|\\mathbf{J}| \\leq J_{\\max}$, and the landing vertical speed bound.
