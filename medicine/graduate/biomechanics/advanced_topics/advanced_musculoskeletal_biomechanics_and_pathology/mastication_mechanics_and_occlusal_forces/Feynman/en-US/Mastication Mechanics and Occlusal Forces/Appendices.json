An occlusal load of magnitude $200\\,\\text{N}$ is applied quasi-statically along the long axis of the tooth during a bite, and the overall tooth–periodontium response is idealized as a linear spring that represents the axial compliance of the periodontal ligament (PDL). The effective axial stiffness of the periodontal ligament (PDL) in this state is $k_{\\text{PDL}}=50\\,\\text{N}/\\text{mm}$. Assume quasi-static equilibrium with negligible inertia and no additional constraints from occlusal contacts beyond the applied force.\n\nStarting from first principles appropriate for quasi-static linear elastic response, derive the expression for the axial displacement $\\delta$ of the tooth crown under load and compute its value for the baseline stiffness. Then, evaluate the effect of an inflammation-driven remodeling that increases the effective stiffness by $20\\%$ (i.e., $k_{\\text{PDL}}$ is multiplied by $1.20$) and compute the new axial displacement.\n\nReport both axial displacements in millimeters, rounded to three significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the axial displacement of a human premolar, modeled as a single-degree-of-freedom linear elastic system, and the computation of this displacement for two different stiffness conditions. The analysis is based on the principles of quasi-static mechanics and linear elasticity.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing physical relationship from first principles. The problem models the tooth-periodontium system as a linear spring. For a linear spring, Hooke's Law states that the restorative force, $F_{\\text{spring}}$, is directly proportional to the displacement, $\\delta$, from its equilibrium position. The constant of proportionality is the spring stiffness, $k$.\n$$F_{\\text{spring}} = k \\delta$$\nThe load is applied quasi-statically, which means the process is slow enough that any dynamic or inertial effects ($F=ma$) can be neglected. Under this condition, the system is considered to be in equilibrium at all times. For equilibrium, the sum of all forces acting on the tooth must be zero. The external applied occlusal load, $F$, must be balanced by the internal restorative force from the periodontal ligament (PDL), $F_{\\text{spring}}$.\n$$F = F_{\\text{spring}}$$\nBy combining these two equations, we obtain the relationship between the applied load, the stiffness, and the displacement:\n$$F = k \\delta$$\nSolving for the axial displacement, $\\delta$, we derive the required expression:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{F}{k}$$\nThis expression will be used to calculate the displacement for both scenarios.\n\nFor the first part of the problem, we calculate the axial displacement for the baseline state. The given values are:\nApplied occlusal load, $F = 200\\,\\text{N}$.\nBaseline axial stiffness of the PDL, $k_{\\text{PDL}} = 50\\,\\text{N}/\\text{mm}$.\n\nLet the baseline displacement be $\\delta_1$.

The new stiffness, which we denote as $k'_{\\text{PDL}}$, is $120\\%$ of the baseline stiffness:\n$$k'_{\\text{PDL}} = k_{\\text{PDL}} \\times (1 + \\frac{20}{100}) = k_{\\text{PDL}} \\times 1.20$$\nSubstituting the value of $k_{\\text{PDL}}$:\n$$k'_{\\text{PDL}} = 50\\,\\text{N}/\\text{mm} \\times 1.20 = 60\\,\\text{N}/\\text{mm}$$\nThe applied load $F$ remains unchanged at $200\\,\\text{N}$.
