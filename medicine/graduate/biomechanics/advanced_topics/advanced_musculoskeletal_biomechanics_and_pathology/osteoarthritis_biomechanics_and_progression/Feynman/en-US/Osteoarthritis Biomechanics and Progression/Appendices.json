            "introduction": "The remarkable load-bearing capacity of articular cartilage stems from a complex interplay between its solid matrix and interstitial fluid. A key factor governing this interaction is the high concentration of negatively charged proteoglycan molecules, which generates a Donnan osmotic swelling pressure. This practice  challenges you to derive this pressure from fundamental physicochemical principles and to calculate its magnitude, providing a quantitative link between the tissue's molecular composition and its macroscopic mechanical function. Understanding this concept is critical, as the loss of proteoglycans is one of the earliest events in osteoarthritis progression.",

            "problem": "Articular cartilage is a hydrated, charged, porous solid whose proteoglycans imbue the matrix with a negative Fixed Charge Density (FCD). Consider a cartilage region with fixed negative charge density $C_{f}=-0.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$ submerged in a bath of monovalent sodium chloride $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ at concentration $c_{0}=0.15\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$ and temperature $T=310\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Assume ideal solution behavior, a semipermeable matrix that excludes the fixed charges but freely permits mobile ions and water, and Donnan equilibrium with electroneutrality inside the gel.\n\nStarting from the equality of electrochemical potentials for the mobile ions at equilibrium, together with electroneutrality and the van ’t Hoff description of osmotic pressure for ideal solutions, derive an expression for the Donnan swelling pressure $\\Pi$ in terms of $R$, $T$, $c_{0}$, and the internal mobile ion concentrations $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ and $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information for a solution is provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the Donnan swelling pressure, $\\Pi$. The swelling pressure is the osmotic pressure difference between the interior of the cartilage gel and the external bathing solution. According to the van 't Hoff law for ideal solutions, the osmotic pressure is proportional to the total concentration of mobile solutes. The mobile solutes in this system are the sodium ($\\text{Na}^+$) and chloride ($\\text{Cl}^-$) ions.\n\nThe total mobile ion concentration inside the gel is $c_{\\text{in}} = c_{\\text{in}}^{+} + c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$. The total mobile ion concentration in the external bath is $c_{\\text{out}} = c_{\\text{out}}^{+} + c_{\\text{out}}^{-}$. The external bath is a $\\text{NaCl}$ solution of concentration $c_0 = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$, so $c_{\\text{out}}^{+} = c_{\\text{out}}^{-} = c_0$. Thus, $c_{\\text{out}} = 2c_0$.\n\nThe swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is the difference in osmotic pressure between the inside and the outside:\n$$ \\Pi = R T (c_{\\text{in}} - c_{\\text{out}}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the total concentrations, we get:\n$$ \\Pi = R T \\left( (c_{\\text{in}}^{+} + c_{\\text{in}}^{-}) - (c_{\\text{out}}^{+} + c_{\\text{out}}^{-}) \\right) $$\n$$ \\Pi = R T (c_{\\text{in}}^{+} + c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - 2c_0) $$\nThis is the required expression for the swelling pressure in terms of $R$, $T$, $c_0$, and the internal mobile ion concentrations $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ and $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$.\n\nNext, we must determine the internal mobile ion concentrations, $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ and $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$, from first principles. We use two conditions: Donnan equilibrium and electroneutrality inside the gel.\n\n1.  **Donnan Equilibrium**: At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential, $\\mu_i$, of each mobile ion species $i$ must be the same inside ($\\text{in}$) and outside ($\\text{out}$) the gel. For an ideal solution, the electrochemical potential is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^0 + RT\\ln(c_i) + z_i F \\psi$, where $\\mu_i^0$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $c_i$ is the molar concentration, $z_i$ is the ionic valence, $F$ is Faraday's constant, and $\\psi$ is the electrical potential.\n    Let the external bath potential be $\\psi_{\\text{out}} = 0$ and the internal potential be the Donnan potential, $\\psi_{\\text{in}} = \\psi_D$.\n\n    For $\\text{Na}^+$ ions ($z=+1$):\n    $$ \\mu_{\\text{in}}^{+} = \\mu_{\\text{out}}^{+} \\implies RT\\ln(c_{\\text{in}}^{+}) + F\\psi_D = RT\\ln(c_{\\text{out}}^{+}) $$\n    $$ \\frac{c_{\\text{in}}^{+}}{c_{\\text{out}}^{+}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F\\psi_D}{RT}\\right) $$\n\n    For $\\text{Cl}^-$ ions ($z=-1$):\n    $$ \\mu_{\\text{in}}^{-} = \\mu_{\\text{out}}^{-} \\implies RT\\ln(c_{\\text{in}}^{-}) - F\\psi_D = RT\\ln(c_{\\text{out}}^{-}) $$\n    $$ \\frac{c_{\\text{in}}^{-}}{c_{\\text{out}}^{-}} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{F\\psi_D}{RT}\\right) $$\n\n    From these two results, we see that $\\frac{c_{\\text{in}}^{+}}{c_{\\text{out}}^{+}} = \\left(\\frac{c_{\\text{in}}^{-}}{c_{\\text{out}}^{-}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{c_{\\text{out}}^{-}}{c_{\\text{in}}^{-}}$. This leads to the Gibbs-Donnan relation:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{+} c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = c_{\\text{out}}^{+} c_{\\text{out}}^{-} $$\n    Since $c_{\\text{out}}^{+} = c_{\\text{out}}^{-} = c_0$, we have:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{+} c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = c_0^2 \\quad (\\text{Eq. 1}) $$\n\n2.  **Electroneutrality**: The net charge density inside the gel must be zero. The total charge is the sum of contributions from mobile positive ions ($\\text{Na}^+$), mobile negative ions ($\\text{Cl}^-$), and the fixed negative charges from proteoglycans ($C_f$).\n    $$ (+1)c_{\\text{in}}^{+} + (-1)c_{\\text{in}}^{-} + C_f = 0 $$\n    Given $C_f = -0.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{+} - c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - 0.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} = 0 \\implies c_{\\text{in}}^{+} - c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = -C_f \\quad (\\text{Eq. 2}) $$\n\n    We now solve the system of two equations (Eq. 1 and Eq. 2) for $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ and $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$. From Eq. 2, $c_{\\text{in}}^{+} = c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - C_f$. Substituting this into Eq. 1:\n    $$ (c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - C_f) c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = c_0^2 $$\n    $$ (c_{\\text{in}}^{-})^2 - C_f c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - c_0^2 = 0 $$\n    This is a quadratic equation for $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$. Using the quadratic formula:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = \\frac{-(-C_f) \\pm \\sqrt{(-C_f)^2 - 4(1)(-c_0^2)}}{2} = \\frac{C_f \\pm \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2} $$\n    Since concentration must be a positive physical quantity and $C_f$ is negative, we must take the positive root:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = \\frac{C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2} $$\n    We can find $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ from Eq. 2:\n    $$ c_{\\text{in}}^{+} = c_{\\text{in}}^{-} - C_f = \\frac{C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2} - C_f = \\frac{-C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value of $\\Pi$. First, we can substitute the expressions for $c_{\\text{in}}^{+}$ and $c_{\\text{in}}^{-}$ into the formula for $\\Pi$:\n$$ c_{\\text{in}}^{+} + c_{\\text{in}}^{-} = \\left(\\frac{-C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{C_f + \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2} $$\nSo the swelling pressure is:\n$$ \\Pi = RT \\left( \\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2} - 2c_0 \\right) $$\n\nWe are given $C_f = -0.2\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$, $c_0 = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$, and $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The ideal gas constant is $R \\approx 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}$.\nFirst, calculate the concentration difference in $\\mathrm{mol/L}$:\n$$ \\Delta c = \\sqrt{(-0.2)^2 + 4(0.15)^2} - 2(0.15) $$\n$$ \\Delta c = \\sqrt{0.04 + 4(0.0225)} - 0.3 $$\n$$ \\Delta c = \\sqrt{0.04 + 0.09} - 0.3 = \\sqrt{0.13} - 0.3 $$\n$$ \\Delta c \\approx 0.360555 - 0.3 = 0.060555\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} $$\nTo calculate pressure in Pascals ($\\mathrm{Pa}$ or $\\mathrm{J/m^3}$), we must convert the concentration from $\\mathrm{mol/L}$ to $\\mathrm{mol/m^3}$ using the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{L} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3$:\n$$ \\Delta c_{SI} = 0.060555\\,\\mathrm{mol/L} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{L}}{10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}^3} = 60.555\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3} $$\nNow, calculate $\\Pi$:\n$$ \\Pi = (8.314\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (60.555\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}) $$\n$$ \\Pi \\approx (2577.34\\,\\mathrm{J/mol}) \\times (60.555\\,\\mathrm{mol/m^3}) \\approx 156073\\,\\mathrm{J/m^3} = 156073\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\nThe final answer is requested in kilopascals ($\\mathrm{kPa}$):\n$$ \\Pi \\approx 156.073\\,\\mathrm{kPa} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $\\Pi = 156\\,\\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nFinally, the discussion on the implications for osteoarthritis.\nOsteoarthritis progression is characterized by the enzymatic degradation of proteoglycans within the cartilage matrix. Since proteoglycans are the molecules responsible for the negative Fixed Charge Density ($C_f$), their loss leads to a reduction in the magnitude of this charge, $|C_f|$.\nOur derived expression for the swelling pressure is $\\Pi = RT (\\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2} - 2c_0)$. To see how $\\Pi$ depends on $|C_f|$, we can observe that for $|C_f|>0$, the term $\\sqrt{C_f^2 + 4c_0^2}$ is a strictly increasing function of $|C_f|$. Therefore, the swelling pressure $\\Pi$ is also a strictly increasing function of $|C_f|$. A reduction in $|C_f|$ during osteoarthritis directly causes a decrease in the Donnan swelling pressure.\nArticular cartilage resists compression through a biphasic mechanism involving both fluid pressurization and matrix stress. The swelling pressure $\\Pi$ creates an internal turgor pressure that inflates the tissue and pre-stresses the collagen-proteoglycan solid matrix. This pre-existing pressure is fundamental to the tissue's ability to support load via fluid pressurization.\nUnder confined compression, a significant portion of the applied load is initially borne by this pressurized interstitial fluid. The apparent compressive stiffness of the cartilage is largely dependent on this fluid pressurization mechanism. A decrease in the Donnan swelling pressure $\\Pi$ signifies a lower initial turgor. Consequently, the cartilage is less able to generate high fluid pressures in response to an applied load. This means that a larger portion of the load is transferred directly to the solid matrix at an earlier stage of loading, and for a given applied stress, the resulting strain is larger. This manifests as a reduction in the apparent compressive stiffness of the tissue. This loss of stiffness impairs the load-bearing function of cartilage and can accelerate mechanical damage to the remaining solid matrix, contributing to the vicious cycle of osteoarthritis progression.",

            "problem": "A medial knee meniscus is idealized as a thin-walled annular ring with inner radius $R_{i} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, outer radius $R_{o} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, and axial thickness $t = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of the average hoop stress in an idealized meniscus under axial compression, followed by a qualitative discussion of the biomechanical consequences of a radial tear.\n\nThe problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The model, though a simplification, is based on established principles of continuum mechanics and is a common first-order approximation in biomechanics. All necessary data and assumptions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem based on the provided data and assumptions.\nThe given parameters are:\nInner radius, $R_{i} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nOuter radius, $R_{o} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nAxial thickness, $t = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$\nCompressive axial load, $F = 2\\,\\mathrm{kN} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nThe radial wall thickness is defined as $w = R_{o} - R_{i}$.\nThe model assumes that the effective in-plane radial pressure, $P_r$, that generates hoop stress is equal to the average axial contact pressure, $P_{axial}$, applied over the annular area of the meniscus.\n\nThe axial pressure $P_{axial}$ is the applied force $F$ distributed over the planform area of the annulus, $A_{annulus}$.\n$$A_{annulus} = \\pi (R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)$$\nThe pressure is therefore:\n$$P_{axial} = \\frac{F}{A_{annulus}} = \\frac{F}{\\pi (R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)}$$\nAccording to the problem's central assumption, the effective radial pressure is $P_r = P_{axial}$.\n$$P_r = \\frac{F}{\\pi (R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)}$$\n\nNext, we derive the hoop stress, $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$, from first principles. We model the meniscus as a thin annular ring and consider a small differential element of the ring subtending an angle $d\\theta$. The hoop stress acts on the cross-sectional face of the ring, which has an area $A_{cross} = w \\times t = (R_{o} - R_{i}) \\times t$.\nThe tensile force (hoop force) on this face is $T = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} A_{cross} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} (R_{o} - R_{i}) t$.\n\nFor the differential element, there are two such forces, $T$, acting tangentially at each end. The vector sum of these two forces creates a resultant force directed radially inward. For a small angle $d\\theta$, the magnitude of this inward resultant force is:\n$$dF_{inward} = 2T \\sin\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{2}\\right) \\approx 2T \\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{2}\\right) = T d\\theta = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} (R_{o} - R_{i}) t \\, d\\theta$$\n\nThis inward force is balanced by the outward force generated by the radial pressure $P_r$. We assume this pressure acts uniformly at the mean radius of the annulus, $R_{avg} = \\frac{R_i + R_o}{2}$. The differential area over which this pressure acts is $dA_{radial} = (R_{avg} d\\theta) \\times t$.\nThe outward force is therefore:\n$$dF_{outward} = P_r dA_{radial} = P_r (R_{avg} d\\theta) t$$\n\nFor static equilibrium, the inward and outward radial forces must balance: $dF_{inward} = dF_{outward}$.\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} (R_{o} - R_{i}) t \\, d\\theta = P_r \\left(\\frac{R_i + R_o}{2}\\right) t \\, d\\theta$$\nThe terms $t$ and $d\\theta$ cancel, yielding the relationship for the hoop stress:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} (R_{o} - R_{i}) = P_r \\frac{R_i + R_o}{2}$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = P_r \\frac{R_i + R_o}{2(R_o - R_i)}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the expression for $P_r$ into this equation.\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{F}{\\pi (R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_i + R_o}{2(R_o - R_i)}\\right)$$\nUsing the difference of squares factorization, $R_{o}^2 - R_{i}^2 = (R_o - R_i)(R_o + R_i)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{F}{\\pi (R_o - R_i)(R_o + R_i)}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R_o + R_i}{2(R_o - R_i)}\\right)$$\nThe term $(R_o + R_i)$ cancels, leading to the final analytical form for the hoop stress under this model's assumptions:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{F}{2\\pi (R_o - R_i)^2}$$\n\nNow we compute the numerical value. All length units must be consistent (e.g., meters) to yield stress in Pascals ($N/m^2$).\n$F = 2000\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$R_{o} = 30\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$R_{i} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$R_{o} - R_{i} = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{2000\\,\\mathrm{N}}{2\\pi (0.01\\,\\mathrm{m})^2} = \\frac{2000}{2\\pi (0.0001)} \\frac{\\mathrm{N}}{\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{1000}{\\pi \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = \\frac{10^7}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$$\nTo express the answer in megapascals (MPa), we divide by $10^6$:\n$$\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = \\frac{10}{\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{MPa} \\approx 3.18309...\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the average hoop stress is $3.18\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nRegarding the qualitative discussion, a healthy meniscus converts axial compressive loads into circumferential (hoop) tensile stress, a function critically dependent on the structural integrity of the circumferential collagen fiber network. A complete radial tear is a fissure that runs from the inner to the outer edge of the meniscus, thereby severing this network.\nMechanistically, this tear acts as a discontinuity, making it impossible for the tissue to sustain tensile stress across the tear surfaces. The condition $\\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = 0$ must hold at the free surfaces of the tear. Consequently, the meniscus loses its ability to function as a cohesive, tension-bearing ring.\nUpon axial loading, the \"opened\" ring can no longer contain the load by developing hoop tension. Instead, the tissue is forced to extrude radially outwards from the joint space between the femur and tibia. The fundamental load-bearing mechanism is compromised. The axial force, no longer efficiently distributed and converted into hoop stress by the meniscus, is instead transmitted more directly to the underlying articular cartilage of the femoral condyles and tibial plateau. This leads to a dramatic increase in the peak and average contact stresses on the cartilage. Such elevated, non-physiological stresses on the articular cartilage are a primary driver for its degradation, fibrillation, and eventual erosion, which are the hallmarks of osteoarthritis progression. In summary, a complete radial tear ablates the hoop stress mechanism, causing meniscal extrusion and overloading of the articular cartilage, thereby initiating or accelerating osteoarthritic changes in the knee joint.",

We can now calculate the new KAM, $KAM_{new}$, by substituting the expression for $d_{new}$:\n$$ KAM_{new} = \\frac{F_{GRF} \\cdot d_{new}}{m} = \\frac{F_{GRF} \\cdot (0.80 \\cdot d_{base})}{m} $$\n\nBy rearranging the terms, we can see the relationship between $KAM_{new}$ and $KAM_{base}$:\n$$ KAM_{new} = 0.80 \\cdot \\left( \\frac{F_{GRF} \\cdot d_{base}}{m} \\right) = 0.80 \\cdot KAM_{base} $$\n\nSubstituting the given value for $KAM_{base}$:\n$$ KAM_{new} = 0.80 \\cdot 0.5\\,\\mathrm{Nm/kg} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{Nm/kg} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the new KAM is $0.4000\\,\\mathrm{Nm/kg}$.\n\nNext, we determine the fractional change in medial compartment contact force. Let $F_{med,base}$ and $F_{med,new}$ be the baseline and new contact forces. The problem states that the medial contact force is directly proportional to the KAM:\n$$ F_{med} = k \\cdot KAM $$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe fractional change, $\\Delta_F$, is defined as:\n$$ \\Delta_F = \\frac{F_{med,new} - F_{med,base}}{F_{med,base}} $$\n\nUsing the proportionality relationship, we can write:\n$$ F_{med,base} = k \\cdot KAM_{base} $$\n$$ F_{med,new} = k \\cdot KAM_{new} $$\n\nSubstituting these into the fractional change formula:\n$$ \\Delta_F = \\frac{k \\cdot KAM_{new} - k \\cdot KAM_{base}}{k \\cdot KAM_{base}} $$\n\nThe proportionality constant $k$ cancels out, demonstrating that the fractional change in force is equal to the fractional change in KAM:\n$$ \\Delta_F = \\frac{KAM_{new} - KAM_{base}}{KAM_{base}} = \\frac{KAM_{new}}{KAM_{base}} - 1 $$\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, we know that the ratio $\\frac{KAM_{new}}{KAM_{base}} = 0.80$. Therefore:\n$$ \\Delta_F = 0.80 - 1 = -0.20 $$\nA value of $-0.20$ represents a $20\\%$ reduction. Rounding to four significant figures, the fractional change is $-0.2000$.\n\nThe two required quantities are the new KAM, $0.4000\\,\\mathrm{Nm/kg}$, and the fractional change in medial contact force, $-0.2000$.",
