The potential energy $U$ of the system, relative to the neutral posture $q=0$, is given by:\n$$U(q) = \\frac{1}{2} q^{\\mathsf{T}} K(\\alpha) q$$\nFor the neutral posture $q=0$ to be a point of stable equilibrium, the potential energy must have a local minimum at this point. This requires that $U(q) > 0$ for all non-zero vectors $q$. This condition is met if and only if the total stiffness matrix $K(\\alpha)$ is positive definite.\n\nThe total stiffness matrix is given by:\n$$K(\\alpha) = K_{\\mathrm{p}} + \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{m}}$$\nThe condition for stability is that $q^{\\mathsf{T}} K(\\alpha) q > 0$ for all $q \\neq 0$. Substituting the expression for $K(\\alpha)$, we get:\n$$q^{\\mathsf{T}} (K_{\\mathrm{p}} + \\alpha K_{\\mathrm{m}}) q > 0$$\nThis can be expanded to:\n$$q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{p}} q + \\alpha q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{m}} q > 0$$\nThe problem states that $K_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is a positive definite matrix, which means $q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{m}} q > 0$ for all $q \\neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide the inequality by $q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{m}} q$ without changing its direction:\n$$\\alpha > -\\frac{q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{p}} q}{q^{\\mathsf{T}} K_{\\mathrm{m}} q}$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for all non-zero $q$. To ensure this, $\\alpha$ must be greater than the maximum possible value of the right-hand side. The minimum value of $\\alpha$ that guarantees stability, $\\alpha_{\\min}$, is thus the supremum of this expression over all non-zero $q$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\min} = \\sup_{q \\neq 0} \\left( -\\frac{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{p}} q}{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{m}} q} \\right)$$\nThe expression $\\frac{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{p}} q}{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{m}} q}$ is a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The set of all values taken by this quotient for $q \\neq 0$ is the range $[\\lambda_{\\min}, \\lambda_{\\max}]$, where $\\lambda_{\\min}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ are the smallest and largest generalized eigenvalues of the matrix pair $(K_{\\mathrm{p}}, K_{\\mathrm{m}})$. These eigenvalues are the solutions $\\lambda$ to the generalized eigenvalue problem $K_{\\mathrm{p}} v = \\lambda K_{\\mathrm{m}} v$.\n\nThe supremum of the negative of the quotient is found by taking the negative of the infimum of the quotient:\n$$\\alpha_{\\min} = -\\inf_{q \\neq 0} \\left( \\frac{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{p}} q}{q^{\\mathsf{T}}K_{\\mathrm{m}} q} \\right) = -\\lambda_{\\min}$$\nThis provides the analytic expression for $\\alpha_{\\min}$ from first principles: it is the negative of the smallest generalized eigenvalue of the pair $(K_{\\mathrm{p}}, K_{\\mathrm{m}})$.\n\nTo find the generalized eigenvalues, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(K_{\\mathrm{p}} - \\lambda K_{\\mathrm{m}}) = 0$. Substituting the given matrices:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{p}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad K_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 30 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 20 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe form the matrix $K_{\\mathrm{p}} - \\lambda K_{\\mathrm{m}}$:\n$$K_{\\mathrm{p}} - \\lambda K_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{pmatrix} 30 & 5 \\\\ 5 & 20 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -4 - 30\\lambda & -1 - 5\\lambda \\\\ -1 - 5\\lambda & 2 - 20\\lambda \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow, we compute its determinant and set it to zero:\n$$\\det(K_{\\mathrm{p}} - \\lambda K_{\\mathrm{m}}) = (-4 - 30\\lambda)(2 - 20\\lambda) - (-1 - 5\\lambda)^2 = 0$$\nExpanding the terms:\n$$(-8 + 80\\lambda - 60\\lambda + 600\\lambda^2) - (1 + 10\\lambda + 25\\lambda^2) = 0$$\n$$(600\\lambda^2 + 20\\lambda - 8) - (25\\lambda^2 + 10\\lambda + 1) = 0$$\nCombining like terms yields the quadratic equation for $\\lambda$:\n$$575\\lambda^2 + 10\\lambda - 9 = 0$$\nWe solve for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=575$, $b=10$, and $c=-9$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{10^2 - 4(575)(-9)}}{2(575)} = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{100 + 20700}}{1150} = \\frac{-10 \\pm \\sqrt{20800}}{1150}$$\nTo simplify the radical: $\\sqrt{20800} = \\sqrt{1600 \\times 13} = 40\\sqrt{13}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{-10 \\pm 40\\sqrt{13}}{1150} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 4\\sqrt{13}}{115}$$\nThe two generalized eigenvalues are $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{-1 + 4\\sqrt{13}}{115}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{-1 - 4\\sqrt{13}}{115}$. Since $\\sqrt{13} > 0$, the smallest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\min}$:\n$$\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{-1 - 4\\sqrt{13}}{115}$$\nThe analytic expression for the minimum co-contraction level is $\\alpha_{\\min} = -\\lambda_{\\min}$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\min} = -\\left( \\frac{-1 - 4\\sqrt{13}}{115} \\right) = \\frac{1 + 4\\sqrt{13}}{115}$$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically. Using $\\sqrt{13} \\approx 3.605551275$:\n$$\\alpha_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{1 + 4 \\times 3.605551275}{115} = \\frac{1 + 14.4222051}{115} = \\frac{15.4222051}{115} \\approx 0.13410613$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives:\n$$\\alpha_{\\min} \\approx 0.1341$$\nThis is the minimum dimensionless co-contraction level required to ensure the energetic stability of the lumbar motion segment's neutral posture.",
