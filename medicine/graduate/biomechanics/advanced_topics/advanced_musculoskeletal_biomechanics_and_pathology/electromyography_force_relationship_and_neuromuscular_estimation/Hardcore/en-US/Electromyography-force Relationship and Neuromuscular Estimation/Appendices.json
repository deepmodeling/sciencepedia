            "problem": "A laboratory intends to estimate muscle activation from surface electromyography (EMG) for isometric force prediction. The recorded EMG has already been bandpass filtered to $20$–$450$ Hz and full-wave rectified. To obtain an envelope that approximates the low-frequency activation dynamics of the muscle, you are asked to design a first-order low-pass filter applied to the rectified signal.\n\nAssume the underlying activation dynamics mapping neural drive to activation can be locally approximated by a first-order linear time-invariant system, but with asymmetric exponential time courses for rising and falling phases: a rise time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35$ ms and a decay time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70$ ms. You will approximate these asymmetric dynamics by a single first-order low-pass filter with time constant $\\tau_f$ applied to the rectified EMG to form the activation estimate.\n\nStarting from the principles of linear first-order systems and exponential responses, and without invoking any pre-specified envelope-design formula, choose $\\tau_f$ by minimizing a symmetric multiplicative mismatch between the rise and decay time constants. That is, select $\\tau_f$ so that it equally favors the exponential rates of both phases in a logarithmic sense. Then, using the frequency response of a first-order low-pass system, determine the cutoff frequency $f_c$ (defined as the $-3$ dB frequency) corresponding to your chosen $\\tau_f$.\n\nProvide the final chosen cutoff frequency as a single number in Hz. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it in Hz. In your reasoning, justify why the resulting cutoff falls within the empirically reasonable range $3$–$10$ Hz for an EMG envelope targeting activation dynamics.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the design of a first-order low-pass filter to generate an electromyography (EMG) envelope that approximates muscle activation dynamics. The filter design must be based on a principled choice of its time constant, $\\tau_f$, derived from the asymmetric rise and decay time constants of muscle activation.\n\nFirst, we formalize the criterion for choosing the filter's time constant, $\\tau_f$. The problem states that the underlying muscle activation dynamics are approximated by asymmetric exponential responses, with a rise time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35$ ms and a decay time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70$ ms. We are instructed to select a single time constant $\\tau_f$ for a symmetric first-order filter that minimizes a symmetric multiplicative mismatch between these two values \"in a logarithmic sense.\"\n\nThis condition implies that the ratio of the chosen time constant $\\tau_f$ to the smaller time constant $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ should be equal to the ratio of the larger time constant $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$ to $\\tau_f$. This ensures that $\\tau_f$ is multiplicatively equidistant from $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_f}{\\tau_{\\text{act}}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{deact}}}{\\tau_f}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the logarithmic distance from $\\ln(\\tau_f)$ to $\\ln(\\tau_{\\text{act}})$ is the same as the logarithmic distance from $\\ln(\\tau_{\\text{deact}})$ to $\\ln(\\tau_f)$, i.e., $\\ln(\\tau_f) - \\ln(\\tau_{\\text{act}}) = \\ln(\\tau_{\\text{deact}}) - \\ln(\\tau_f)$.\n\nTo solve for $\\tau_f$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\tau_f^2 = \\tau_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{deact}}\n$$\nTaking the positive square root, as time constants must be positive, we find that $\\tau_f$ is the geometric mean of $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_f = \\sqrt{\\tau_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{deact}}}\n$$\nWe are given the values $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35 \\text{ ms} = 0.035 \\text{ s}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70 \\text{ ms} = 0.070 \\text{ s}$. Substituting these into the formula:\n$$\n\\tau_f = \\sqrt{(0.035 \\text{ s}) \\cdot (0.070 \\text{ s})} = \\sqrt{0.00245 \\text{ s}^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the cutoff frequency, $f_c$, corresponding to this time constant. The transfer function of a first-order low-pass filter is given in the Laplace domain by:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + s\\tau_f}\n$$\nThe frequency response is found by setting $s = j\\omega$, where $j$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency.\n$$\nH(j\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 + j\\omega\\tau_f}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the frequency response is:\n$$\n|H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{|1 + j\\omega\\tau_f|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega\\tau_f)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f \\tau_f)^2}}\n$$\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is defined as the frequency at which the signal power is halved, which corresponds to the magnitude dropping to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. The DC magnitude is $|H(j0)| = 1$. Therefore, at $f = f_c$, we have:\n$$\n|H(j2\\pi f_c)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the magnitude equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides and inverting yields:\n$$\n1 + (2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2 = 2\n$$\n$$\n(2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2 = 1\n$$\nTaking the positive root, as $f_c$ and $\\tau_f$ are positive:\n$$\n2\\pi f_c \\tau_f = 1\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between the cutoff frequency and time constant for a first-order system:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_f}\n$$\nNow, we substitute our expression for $\\tau_f$:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{0.00245 \\text{ s}^2}}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\nf_c \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi (0.04949747... \\text{ s})} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.31100... \\text{ s}} \\approx 3.2159... \\text{ Hz}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\nf_c \\approx 3.22 \\text{ Hz}\n$$\nThis result lies within the empirically reasonable range of $3$–$10$ Hz. This range is justified because the ultimate goal is to estimate muscle force, which is a low-frequency physiological process. The majority of the power in voluntary muscle force signals is concentrated below $10$ Hz. A low-pass filter with a cutoff in this range effectively removes the high-frequency stochastic components of the raw EMG signal, which are not directly related to the net force output, while preserving the low-frequency content that reflects the graded neural drive to the muscle. A cutoff frequency of $3.22$ Hz provides significant smoothing to create a stable force estimate, yet it is high enough to track moderately fast changes in isometric contraction levels without introducing excessive phase lag, thus striking a biophysically-motivated balance between noise rejection and system responsiveness.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-joint isometric task performed on two separate days by the same participant. Let the mechanical force be denoted by $F$ and the neural drive to the motoneuron pool be denoted by $u$. Assume a locally linear input-output map over the operating range of interest: $F = \\eta u$, where $\\eta$ is a constant representing the effective musculo-tendon gain for isometric force production. Let the processed surface Electromyography (EMG) amplitude be $E$, and assume a locally linear relation between EMG amplitude and neural drive, $E = \\gamma u$, where $\\gamma$ is an aggregate gain reflecting electrode, tissue, and motor unit characteristics. Suppose both relations are valid in the moderate-contraction range and that baseline offsets have been properly removed.\n\nNormalization to Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) amplitude is defined as $\\hat{E} = E / E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$, where $E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$ is the EMG amplitude recorded during the MVC on a given day. On day $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, suppose the recorded MVC does not reach true maximal activation and attains only a fraction $\\beta_i u_{\\max}$ of the true maximal neural drive $u_{\\max}$, with $0\\beta_i\\leq 1$. Consequently, $E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i} = \\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}$.

Express the final result as a dimensionless multiplier with no unit.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze the relationship between normalized surface Electromyography (EMG) and mechanical force under specific modeling assumptions and to quantify the effect of day-to-day variations in Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) performance on this relationship.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationships provided. The mechanical force $F$ is related to the neural drive $u$ by a linear gain $\\eta$:\n$$F = \\eta u$$\nThe processed EMG amplitude $E$ is related to the same neural drive $u$ by another linear gain $\\gamma$:\n$$E = \\gamma u$$\nBoth $\\eta$ and $\\gamma$ are assumed to be constant across the two days of measurement.\n\nFrom these two equations, we can express the EMG amplitude $E$ as a function of force $F$. By rearranging the first equation, we get $u = F/\\eta$. Substituting this into the second equation yields the direct EMG-force relationship:\n$$E = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{F}{\\eta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\eta}\\right) F$$\nThe slope of the unnormalized EMG-force relationship is the derivative of $E$ with respect to $F$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dF} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\eta}$$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are constant across days, the unnormalized slope is also constant. This implies that if we were to use the raw EMG signal, the EMG-force relationship would be perfectly comparable between the two days under these idealized assumptions.\n\nNext, we consider the normalization procedure. The normalized EMG, $\\hat{E}$, is defined as the raw EMG amplitude $E$ divided by the EMG amplitude recorded during an MVC, $E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$. For a specific day $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, this is:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i}}$$\nThe problem states that on day $i$, the MVC attempt only reaches a fraction $\\beta_i$ of the true maximal neural drive $u_{\\max}$. Therefore, the recorded EMG during this attempt is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i} = \\gamma (\\beta_i u_{\\max}) = \\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}$$\nwhere $0  \\beta_i \\leq 1$.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the normalized EMG on day $i$, $\\hat{E}_i$, as a function of force $F$. We substitute the expressions for $E$ and $E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i}$:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{(\\gamma/\\eta)F}{\\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThe gain term $\\gamma$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{F}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThis equation describes the linear relationship between the normalized EMG amplitude and the mechanical force for day $i$.\n\nTo find the normalized EMG-force slope for day $i$, we differentiate $\\hat{E}_i$ with respect to $F$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{i} = \\frac{d}{dF}\\left(\\frac{F}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThis derivation reveals how normalization affects the slope. While the unnormalized slope $\\gamma/\\eta$ was constant, the normalized slope is inversely proportional to the MVC attainment fraction $\\beta_i$. If $\\beta_i$ varies from day to day (i.e., $\\beta_1 \\neq \\beta_2$), the normalized EMG-force slope will also vary, even though the underlying physiological parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are unchanged. This shows that normalization to a fluctuating reference (a non-true MVC) can introduce variability and compromise inter-day comparability.\n\nWe are asked to compute the inter-day comparability ratio, $R$, defined as the ratio of the normalized slopes for day $1$ and day $2$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{1}}{\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the slope we derived for each day:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_1 u_{\\max}}}{\\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_2 u_{\\max}}}$$\nThe terms $\\eta$ and $u_{\\max}$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out:\n$$R = \\frac{1/\\beta_1}{1/\\beta_2} = \\frac{\\beta_2}{\\beta_1}$$\nThis concise result shows that the ratio of the normalized EMG-force slopes is equal to the inverse ratio of the MVC attainment fractions.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $R$ for the given values $\\beta_1 = 0.80$ and $\\beta_2 = 0.90$.\n$$R = \\frac{0.90}{0.80} = \\frac{9}{8} = 1.125$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result $1.125$ can be expressed with four significant figures by adding a trailing zero.\n$$R = 1.1250$$\nThis result indicates that the normalized EMG-force slope on day $1$ is $1.1250$ times larger than the slope on day $2$. This difference is entirely an artifact of the day-to-day variation in MVC performance used for normalization, not a change in the underlying neuromuscular system.",
