A critical first step is to transform the high-frequency, stochastic EMG signal into a smooth envelope that represents the underlying muscle activation dynamics. This exercise guides you through the principled design of a low-pass filter, a cornerstone of EMG processing, by grounding the choice of filter parameters in the physiological time constants of muscle activation and deactivation.

            "problem": "A laboratory intends to estimate muscle activation from surface electromyography (EMG) for isometric force prediction. The recorded EMG has already been bandpass filtered to $20$–$450$ Hz and full-wave rectified. To obtain an envelope that approximates the low-frequency activation dynamics of the muscle, you are asked to design a first-order low-pass filter applied to the rectified signal.\n\nAssume the underlying activation dynamics mapping neural drive to activation can be locally approximated by a first-order linear time-invariant system, but with asymmetric exponential time courses for rising and falling phases: a rise time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35$ ms and a decay time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70$ ms. You will approximate these asymmetric dynamics by a single first-order low-pass filter with time constant $\\tau_f$ applied to the rectified EMG to form the activation estimate.\n\nStarting from the principles of linear first-order systems and exponential responses, and without invoking any pre-specified envelope-design formula, choose $\\tau_f$ by minimizing a symmetric multiplicative mismatch between the rise and decay time constants. That is, select $\\tau_f$ so that it equally favors the exponential rates of both phases in a logarithmic sense. Then, using the frequency response of a first-order low-pass system, determine the cutoff frequency $f_c$ (defined as the $-3$ dB frequency) corresponding to your chosen $\\tau_f$.\n\nProvide the final chosen cutoff frequency as a single number in Hz. Round your answer to three significant figures and express it in Hz. In your reasoning, justify why the resulting cutoff falls within the empirically reasonable range $3$–$10$ Hz for an EMG envelope targeting activation dynamics.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the design of a first-order low-pass filter to generate an electromyography (EMG) envelope that approximates muscle activation dynamics. The filter design must be based on a principled choice of its time constant, $\\tau_f$, derived from the asymmetric rise and decay time constants of muscle activation.\n\nFirst, we formalize the criterion for choosing the filter's time constant, $\\tau_f$. The problem states that the underlying muscle activation dynamics are approximated by asymmetric exponential responses, with a rise time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35$ ms and a decay time constant of $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70$ ms. We are instructed to select a single time constant $\\tau_f$ for a symmetric first-order filter that minimizes a symmetric multiplicative mismatch between these two values \"in a logarithmic sense.\"\n\nThis condition implies that the ratio of the chosen time constant $\\tau_f$ to the smaller time constant $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ should be equal to the ratio of the larger time constant $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$ to $\\tau_f$. This ensures that $\\tau_f$ is multiplicatively equidistant from $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_f}{\\tau_{\\text{act}}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{deact}}}{\\tau_f}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to stating that the logarithmic distance from $\\ln(\\tau_f)$ to $\\ln(\\tau_{\\text{act}})$ is the same as the logarithmic distance from $\\ln(\\tau_{\\text{deact}})$ to $\\ln(\\tau_f)$, i.e., $\\ln(\\tau_f) - \\ln(\\tau_{\\text{act}}) = \\ln(\\tau_{\\text{deact}}) - \\ln(\\tau_f)$.\n\nTo solve for $\\tau_f$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\n\\tau_f^2 = \\tau_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{deact}}\n$$\nTaking the positive square root, as time constants must be positive, we find that $\\tau_f$ is the geometric mean of $\\tau_{\\text{act}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_f = \\sqrt{\\tau_{\\text{act}} \\cdot \\tau_{\\text{deact}}}\n$$\nWe are given the values $\\tau_{\\text{act}} = 35 \\text{ ms} = 0.035 \\text{ s}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deact}} = 70 \\text{ ms} = 0.070 \\text{ s}$. Substituting these into the formula:\n$$\n\\tau_f = \\sqrt{(0.035 \\text{ s}) \\cdot (0.070 \\text{ s})} = \\sqrt{0.00245 \\text{ s}^2}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the cutoff frequency, $f_c$, corresponding to this time constant. The transfer function of a first-order low-pass filter is given in the Laplace domain by:\n$$\nH(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + s\\tau_f}\n$$\nThe frequency response is found by setting $s = j\\omega$, where $j$ is the imaginary unit and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency.\n$$\nH(j\\omega) = \\frac{1}{1 + j\\omega\\tau_f}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the frequency response is:\n$$\n|H(j\\omega)| = \\frac{1}{|1 + j\\omega\\tau_f|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega\\tau_f)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f \\tau_f)^2}}\n$$\nThe cutoff frequency $f_c$ is defined as the frequency at which the signal power is halved, which corresponds to the magnitude dropping to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its DC value. The DC magnitude is $|H(j0)| = 1$. Therefore, at $f = f_c$, we have:\n$$\n|H(j2\\pi f_c)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the magnitude equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides and inverting yields:\n$$\n1 + (2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2 = 2\n$$\n$$\n(2\\pi f_c \\tau_f)^2 = 1\n$$\nTaking the positive root, as $f_c$ and $\\tau_f$ are positive:\n$$\n2\\pi f_c \\tau_f = 1\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental relationship between the cutoff frequency and time constant for a first-order system:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_f}\n$$\nNow, we substitute our expression for $\\tau_f$:\n$$\nf_c = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{0.00245 \\text{ s}^2}}\n$$\nNumerically evaluating this expression:\n$$\nf_c \\approx \\frac{1}{2\\pi (0.04949747... \\text{ s})} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.31100... \\text{ s}} \\approx 3.2159... \\text{ Hz}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\nf_c \\approx 3.22 \\text{ Hz}\n$$\nThis result lies within the empirically reasonable range of $3$–$10$ Hz. This range is justified because the ultimate goal is to estimate muscle force, which is a low-frequency physiological process. The majority of the power in voluntary muscle force signals is concentrated below $10$ Hz. A low-pass filter with a cutoff in this range effectively removes the high-frequency stochastic components of the raw EMG signal, which are not directly related to the net force output, while preserving the low-frequency content that reflects the graded neural drive to the muscle. A cutoff frequency of $3.22$ Hz provides significant smoothing to create a stable force estimate, yet it is high enough to track moderately fast changes in isometric contraction levels without introducing excessive phase lag, thus striking a biophysically-motivated balance between noise rejection and system responsiveness.",

            "introduction": "Once a reliable muscle activation signal is obtained, a common and crucial step is normalization, which aims to make EMG amplitudes comparable across different muscles, subjects, or experimental sessions. Normalizing to the EMG recorded during a Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) is a standard technique, yet it rests on the assumption that the MVC is a consistent and true maximal effort. This practice uses a simplified but powerful linear model to explore the mathematical consequences when this assumption is not met. Through this analysis, you will quantify how seemingly small variations in daily MVC performance can introduce significant artifacts into the normalized EMG-force relationship, fostering a critical perspective on this ubiquitous experimental method .",

            "problem": "Consider a single-joint isometric task performed on two separate days by the same participant. Let the mechanical force be denoted by $F$ and the neural drive to the motoneuron pool be denoted by $u$. Assume a locally linear input-output map over the operating range of interest: $F = \\eta u$, where $\\eta$ is a constant representing the effective musculo-tendon gain for isometric force production. Let the processed surface Electromyography (EMG) amplitude be $E$, and assume a locally linear relation between EMG amplitude and neural drive, $E = \\gamma u$, where $\\gamma$ is an aggregate gain reflecting electrode, tissue, and motor unit characteristics. Suppose both relations are valid in the moderate-contraction range and that baseline offsets have been properly removed.\n\nNormalization to Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) amplitude is defined as $\\hat{E} = E / E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$, where $E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$ is the EMG amplitude recorded during the MVC on a given day. On day $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$, suppose the recorded MVC does not reach true maximal activation and attains only a fraction $\\beta_i u_{\\max}$ of the true maximal neural drive $u_{\\max}$, with $0 < \\beta_i \\leq 1$. Consequently, $E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i} = \\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}$. Assume $\\eta$ and $\\gamma$ are constant across the two days.\n\nUsing these premises, derive the normalized EMG-force slope for each day and show how normalization to MVC affects inter-day comparability of EMG-force slopes.

Express the final result as a dimensionless multiplier with no unit.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to analyze the relationship between normalized surface Electromyography (EMG) and mechanical force under specific modeling assumptions and to quantify the effect of day-to-day variations in Maximal Voluntary Contraction (MVC) performance on this relationship.\n\nFirst, we formalize the relationships provided. The mechanical force $F$ is related to the neural drive $u$ by a linear gain $\\eta$:\n$$F = \\eta u$$\nThe processed EMG amplitude $E$ is related to the same neural drive $u$ by another linear gain $\\gamma$:\n$$E = \\gamma u$$\nBoth $\\eta$ and $\\gamma$ are assumed to be constant across the two days of measurement.\n\nFrom these two equations, we can express the EMG amplitude $E$ as a function of force $F$. By rearranging the first equation, we get $u = F/\\eta$. Substituting this into the second equation yields the direct EMG-force relationship:\n$$E = \\gamma \\left(\\frac{F}{\\eta}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\eta}\\right) F$$\nThe slope of the unnormalized EMG-force relationship is the derivative of $E$ with respect to $F$:\n$$\\frac{dE}{dF} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\eta}$$\nSince $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are constant across days, the unnormalized slope is also constant. This implies that if we were to use the raw EMG signal, the EMG-force relationship would be perfectly comparable between the two days under these idealized assumptions.\n\nNext, we consider the normalization procedure. The normalized EMG, $\\hat{E}$, is defined as the raw EMG amplitude $E$ divided by the EMG amplitude recorded during an MVC, $E_{\\mathrm{MVC}}$. For a specific day $i \\in \\{1, 2\\}$, this is:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{E}{E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i}}$$\nThe problem states that on day $i$, the MVC attempt only reaches a fraction $\\beta_i$ of the true maximal neural drive $u_{\\max}$. Therefore, the recorded EMG during this attempt is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i} = \\gamma (\\beta_i u_{\\max}) = \\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}$$\nwhere $0 < \\beta_i \\leq 1$.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the normalized EMG on day $i$, $\\hat{E}_i$, as a function of force $F$. We substitute the expressions for $E$ and $E_{\\mathrm{MVC},i}$:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{(\\gamma/\\eta)F}{\\gamma \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThe gain term $\\gamma$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\\hat{E}_i = \\frac{F}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThis equation describes the linear relationship between the normalized EMG amplitude and the mechanical force for day $i$.\n\nTo find the normalized EMG-force slope for day $i$, we differentiate $\\hat{E}_i$ with respect to $F$:\n$$\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{i} = \\frac{d}{dF}\\left(\\frac{F}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_i u_{\\max}}$$\nThis derivation reveals how normalization affects the slope. While the unnormalized slope $\\gamma/\\eta$ was constant, the normalized slope is inversely proportional to the MVC attainment fraction $\\beta_i$. If $\\beta_i$ varies from day to day (i.e., $\\beta_1 \\neq \\beta_2$), the normalized EMG-force slope will also vary, even though the underlying physiological parameters $\\gamma$ and $\\eta$ are unchanged. This shows that normalization to a fluctuating reference (a non-true MVC) can introduce variability and compromise inter-day comparability.\n\nWe are asked to compute the inter-day comparability ratio, $R$, defined as the ratio of the normalized slopes for day $1$ and day $2$:\n$$R = \\frac{\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{1}}{\\left.\\frac{d\\hat{E}}{dF}\\right|_{2}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the slope we derived for each day:\n$$R = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_1 u_{\\max}}}{\\frac{1}{\\eta \\beta_2 u_{\\max}}}$$\nThe terms $\\eta$ and $u_{\\max}$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out:\n$$R = \\frac{1/\\beta_1}{1/\\beta_2} = \\frac{\\beta_2}{\\beta_1}$$\nThis concise result shows that the ratio of the normalized EMG-force slopes is equal to the inverse ratio of the MVC attainment fractions.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $R$ for the given values $\\beta_1 = 0.80$ and $\\beta_2 = 0.90$.\n$$R = \\frac{0.90}{0.80} = \\frac{9}{8} = 1.125$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact result $1.125$ can be expressed with four significant figures by adding a trailing zero.\n$$R = 1.1250$$\nThis result indicates that the normalized EMG-force slope on day $1$ is $1.1250$ times larger than the slope on day $2$. This difference is entirely an artifact of the day-to-day variation in MVC performance used for normalization, not a change in the underlying neuromuscular system.",
