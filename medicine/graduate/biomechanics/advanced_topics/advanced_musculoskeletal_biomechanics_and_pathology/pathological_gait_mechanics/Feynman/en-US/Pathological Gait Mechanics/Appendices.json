This exercise  moves beyond simple definitions, challenging you to use first principles to derive the necessary compensations in stride length and cadence when a person increases their double support time—a common strategy to improve stability—while maintaining a constant speed. Working through this problem builds a deep, analytical understanding of the kinematic trade-offs that govern walking.",

            "problem": "Consider steady-state human walking analyzed with standard spatiotemporal gait variables. Let $v$ denote forward speed, $L$ denote stride length, and $C$ denote cadence (steps per second). The fundamental kinematic identity is $v = \\frac{L \\cdot C}{2}$, which follows from the definition of step length as $L/2$ and cadence as steps per second. Define the gait cycle time $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}$ as the duration of one stride (two steps), and assume symmetric gait with no aerial phase so that the total single support time equals the total swing time across the cycle. Let $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ denote the duration of each double support phase, and $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ denote the duration of each swing phase per limb. The total gait cycle time is then $T_{\\mathrm{gc}} = 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$, and cadence satisfies $C = \\frac{2}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$. Define the baseline double support fraction of the gait cycle as $f = \\frac{2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$.\n\nModel the swing phase as a passive pendular motion of the leg segment about the hip joint, with half-period $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ determined predominantly by leg length and gravitational acceleration; for this problem, treat $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ as a constant with respect to the imposed change. A pathological adaptation increases double support time per phase by $10\\%$ while forward speed $v$ is held constant by the subject. Derive, from first principles starting with the above definitions, how this $10\\%$ increase in $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ constrains the concomitant changes in stride length and cadence. Specifically, express the required ratios $\\frac{L'}{L}$ and $\\frac{C'}{C}$ in terms of the baseline double support fraction $f$, where primes denote the values after the increase in double support.\n\nExpress your final answer as exact analytic expressions (unitless). No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to validation.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Forward speed: $v$\n- Stride length: $L$\n- Cadence (steps per second): $C$\n- Kinematic identity: $v = \\frac{L \\cdot C}{2}$\n- Gait cycle time: $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}$ (duration of one stride, or two steps)\n- Assumption: Symmetric gait with no aerial phase.\n- Duration of each double support phase: $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$\n- Duration of each swing phase per limb: $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$\n- Gait cycle time composition: $T_{\\mathrm{gc}} = 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$\n- Cadence-gait cycle relationship: $C = \\frac{2}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$\n- Baseline double support fraction: $f = \\frac{2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$\n- Constraint 1: $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ is treated as a constant.\n- Pathological change: Double support time increases by $10\\%$. Let primed variables denote values after the change. So, $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}' = (1 + 0.10) T_{\\mathrm{ds}} = 1.1 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$.\n- Constraint 2: Forward speed is held constant, $v' = v$.\n- Objective: Derive the ratios $\\frac{L'}{L}$ and $\\frac{C'}{C}$ in terms of the baseline double support fraction $f$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, employing standard definitions and relationships from biomechanical gait analysis. The kinematic identity $v = \\frac{L \\cdot C}{2}$ is fundamental. The decomposition of the gait cycle time $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}$ into double support ($T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$) and swing ($T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$) phases is a standard model. The assumption that swing time $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ is constant is a common simplification based on the observation that leg swing behaves like a pendulum, with its period largely determined by constant physical parameters like leg length. The scenario of increased double support time at a constant speed is a clinically relevant adaptation seen in various gait pathologies where individuals seek to increase stability. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and provides sufficient information for a unique solution. It is not trivial and requires a rigorous derivation from the provided first principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\nThe goal is to find the expressions for the ratios $\\frac{L'}{L}$ and $\\frac{C'}{C}$ as a function of the baseline double support fraction, $f$. The primed variables ($L'$, $C'$, $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}'$, $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'$) represent the state after the pathological adaptation, while the unprimed variables represent the baseline state.\n\nThe core constraints are:\n$1$. $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}' = 1.1 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$\n$2$. $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}' = T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ (given that $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ is constant)\n$3$. $v' = v$\n\nFirst, let's determine the ratio of cadences, $\\frac{C'}{C}$.\nFrom the definition of cadence, $C = \\frac{2}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$, it follows that the ratio of cadences is inversely proportional to the ratio of gait cycle times:\n$$\n\\frac{C'}{C} = \\frac{2/T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'}{2/T_{\\mathrm{gc}}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'}\n$$\nWe need to express this ratio in terms of $f$. Let's start with the expressions for the gait cycle times before and after the change:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{gc}} = 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{gc}}' = 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}' + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}'\n$$\nSubstituting the constraints $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}' = 1.1 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}' = T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ into the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{gc}}' = 2 (1.1 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}) + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}} = 2.2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}\n$$\nNow, we express $T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ in terms of $f$ and $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}$.\nFrom the definition of the double support fraction, $f = \\frac{2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}$, we can write:\n$$\n2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} = f T_{\\mathrm{gc}}\n$$\nFrom the composition of the gait cycle time, $T_{\\mathrm{gc}} = 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$, we can express the total swing time as:\n$$\n2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}} = T_{\\mathrm{gc}} - 2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}} = T_{\\mathrm{gc}} - f T_{\\mathrm{gc}} = T_{\\mathrm{gc}} (1 - f)\n$$\nNow substitute these expressions for $2T_{\\mathrm{ds}}$ and $2T_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ into the equation for $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{gc}}' = 1.1 (2 T_{\\mathrm{ds}}) + 2 T_{\\mathrm{sw}} = 1.1 (f T_{\\mathrm{gc}}) + T_{\\mathrm{gc}} (1 - f)\n$$\nFactor out $T_{\\mathrm{gc}}$:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{gc}}' = T_{\\mathrm{gc}} (1.1f + 1 - f) = T_{\\mathrm{gc}} (1 + 0.1f)\n$$\nNow we can compute the ratio $\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'}$:\n$$\n\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}'} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}}{T_{\\mathrm{gc}}(1+0.1f)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 0.1f}\n$$\nThus, the ratio of cadences is:\n$$\n\\frac{C'}{C} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{10}f} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10+f}{10}} = \\frac{10}{10+f}\n$$\nNext, let's determine the ratio of stride lengths, $\\frac{L'}{L}$.\nWe use the fundamental kinematic identity, $v = \\frac{L \\cdot C}{2}$.\nFor the baseline case: $v = \\frac{LC}{2}$.\nFor the adapted case: $v' = \\frac{L'C'}{2}$.\nThe problem states that forward speed is constant, so $v' = v$.\n$$\n\\frac{L'C'}{2} = \\frac{LC}{2}\n$$\nThis simplifies to $L'C' = LC$. Rearranging to find the desired ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{L'}{L} = \\frac{C}{C'}\n$$\nThis is the reciprocal of the cadence ratio we just found.\n$$\n\\frac{L'}{L} = \\frac{1}{C'/C} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{10}{10+f}} = \\frac{10+f}{10}\n$$\nAlternatively, this can be written as $1 + \\frac{f}{10}$.\n\nThe required ratios are $\\frac{L'}{L} = \\frac{10+f}{10}$ and $\\frac{C'}{C} = \\frac{10}{10+f}$.\nThe solution demonstrates that to maintain a constant speed while increasing double support time (which lengthens the gait cycle and thus decreases cadence), the subject must increase their stride length. The magnitudes of these reciprocal changes are determined by the baseline double support fraction $f$.",

The calculation will be based on first principles of mechanics.\n\nThe external ankle moment about the ankle joint center (AJC) is the moment created by the ground reaction force (GRF) vector, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}$, which acts at the center of pressure (CoP). The moment $\\vec{M}_{a}$ about a point (the AJC) is defined by the cross product of the position vector $\\vec{r}$ from the point to the point of force application and the force vector $\\vec{F}$:\n$$\n\\vec{M}_{a} = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}\n$$\nThe analysis is restricted to the sagittal plane, defined by the $x$ (anterior–posterior) and $y$ (vertical) axes. The moment will therefore be about the $z$ axis. The given coordinate system is right-handed, with $x$ being anterior-positive and $y$ being superior-positive. The problem specifies that a positive moment about $z$, $M_{a,z}$, corresponds to a counterclockwise (dorsiflexion) moment. The vector formulation $\\vec{M}_a = \\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}$ is consistent with this convention, as a rotation from the positive $x$-axis to the positive $y$-axis is counterclockwise, corresponding to the positive $z$-direction.\n\nFirst, we define the relevant vectors at time $t_{\\mathrm{ms}} = 0.41$ s based on the provided data.\nThe position of the AJC is $\\vec{p}_{\\text{AJC}} = x_{\\text{AJC}}\\hat{i} + y_{\\text{AJC}}\\hat{j}$.\nThe position of the CoP is $\\vec{p}_{\\text{CoP}} = x_{\\text{CoP}}\\hat{i} + y_{\\text{CoP}}\\hat{j}$.\nThe position vector $\\vec{r}$ from the AJC to the CoP is:\n$$\n\\vec{r} = \\vec{p}_{\\text{CoP}} - \\vec{p}_{\\text{AJC}} = (x_{\\text{CoP}} - x_{\\text{AJC}})\\hat{i} + (y_{\\text{CoP}} - y_{\\text{AJC}})\\hat{j}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$x_{\\text{AJC}} = 0.000$ m, $y_{\\text{AJC}} = 0.055$ m\n$x_{\\text{CoP}} = -0.030$ m, $y_{\\text{CoP}} = 0.000$ m\nThe components of $\\vec{r}$ are:\n$r_x = x_{\\text{CoP}} - x_{\\text{AJC}} = -0.030 \\text{ m} - 0.000 \\text{ m} = -0.030 \\text{ m}$\n$r_y = y_{\\text{CoP}} - y_{\\text{AJC}} = 0.000 \\text{ m} - 0.055 \\text{ m} = -0.055 \\text{ m}$\nSo, $\\vec{r} = -0.030\\hat{i} - 0.055\\hat{j}$ m.\n\nNext, we define the GRF vector, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}} = F_x\\hat{i} + F_y\\hat{j}$.\nThe components are given as:\n$F_x = 18$ N\n$F_y = 1.10 \\cdot m \\cdot g$\nWith subject mass $m = 70$ kg and gravitational acceleration $g = 9.81 \\text{ m s}^{-2}$:\n$F_y = 1.10 \\times 70 \\text{ kg} \\times 9.81 \\text{ m s}^{-2} = 755.37 \\text{ N}$\nSo, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}} = 18\\hat{i} + 755.37\\hat{j}$ N.\n\nThe sagittal-plane moment $M_{a,z}$ is the $z$-component of the cross product $\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}$:\n$$\nM_{a,z} = (\\vec{r} \\times \\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}) \\cdot \\hat{k} = r_x F_y - r_y F_x\n$$\nSubstituting the calculated components of $\\vec{r}$ and $\\vec{F}_{\\text{GRF}}$:\n$$\nM_{a,z} = (-0.030 \\text{ m}) \\times (755.37 \\text{ N}) - (-0.055 \\text{ m}) \\times (18 \\text{ N})\n$$\n$$\nM_{a,z} = -22.6611 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m} - (-0.99 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m})\n$$\n$$\nM_{a,z} = -22.6611 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m} + 0.99 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m} = -21.6711 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nThe problem requests the result rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nM_{a,z} \\approx -21.7 \\text{ N}\\cdot\\text{m}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the external moment is in the clockwise direction. According to the stated convention, this is a plantarflexion moment.\n\nFor the interpretation: The external moment is the rotational effect the ground reaction force imposes on the foot-ankle complex. To maintain a stable ankle position (i.e., prevent acceleration into plantarflexion), the neuromuscular system must generate an internal moment that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to this external moment. The calculated external moment of $-21.7$ N$\\cdot$m is a plantarflexion moment. Therefore, an internal dorsiflexion moment of $+21.7$ N$\\cdot$m must be generated by the muscles crossing the ankle, primarily the tibialis anterior. This is the \"dorsiflexion demand\".\n\nIf the CoP were located anterior to the AJC (i.e., $x_{\\mathrm{CoP}} > x_{\\mathrm{AJC}}$), the term $r_x F_y$ would become positive and dominant, resulting in a positive (dorsiflexion) external moment. This would, in turn, require an internal plantarflexion moment (a \"plantarflexion demand\") from the calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus) for stability. Thus, a posterior CoP (relative to the AJC) creates a demand on the dorsiflexor muscles, whereas an anterior CoP creates a demand on the plantarflexor muscles.",

The modeling target is a coronal-plane knee contact distribution derived from first principles of mechanics. The program must be entirely self-contained and run without user input.\n\nBegin from the following foundational bases in biomechanics and mechanics:\n- Newton's second law, $\\sum \\mathbf{F} = m \\mathbf{a}$.\n- Static moment equilibrium in the coronal plane during quasi-static single-limb stance, $\\sum M = 0$ about the knee joint center.\n- Definition of ground reaction force, contact forces, and joint moments, treating the knee as a hinge with coronal-plane load sharing between the medial and lateral compartments.\n\nModeling assumptions and definitions to use:\n- The knee joint experiences a compressive tibiofemoral load $F_c$ resulting from external forces and muscle forces during stance. Because explicit muscle forces are not provided, represent their net compressive contribution by a dimensionless co-contraction scaling factor $\\lambda$ applied to the vertical component of the ground reaction force $F_{\\text{GRF}}$ so that $F_c$ is proportional to $F_{\\text{GRF}}$ through $\\lambda$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the implementation of a simplified biomechanical model to estimate the medial compartment tibiofemoral contact force during gait and to validate this model against instrumented measurements. The solution will be derived from the first principles of static mechanics and executed for a given set of test cases.\n\nThe model is based on the following principles and assumptions for quasi-static single-limb stance:\n1.  The total compressive tibiofemoral load, $F_c$, is composed of contributions from the ground reaction force and muscle forces. We are given a simplified parameterization where muscle co-contraction's effect is captured by a dimensionless scaling factor, $\\lambda$. The total compressive load is thus modeled as being directly proportional to the vertical ground reaction force, $F_{\\text{GRF}}$:\n    $$F_c = \\lambda \\cdot F_{\\text{GRF}}$$\n2.  The knee joint is modeled as a hinge in the coronal plane. The total compressive load $F_c$ is shared between the medial and lateral compartments. Let $F_m$ and $F_l$ be the medial and lateral contact forces, respectively. The force balance equation is:\n    $$F_c = F_m + F_l$$\n3.  The coronal-plane moment about the knee joint center must be in equilibrium, $\\sum M = 0$. The external knee adduction moment, $M_{\\text{add}}$, which tends to cause varus collapse, must be balanced by an internal abduction moment generated by the differential loading of the medial and lateral compartments. The contact points for $F_m$ and $F_l$ are separated by a tibiofemoral contact width $w$. Assuming the knee joint center is located symmetrically between these two points, the moment arm for both forces is $w/2$. The internal moment is the sum of the moments generated by $F_m$ and $F_l$. By convention, an adduction moment is counteracted by an internal moment where $F_m > F_l$. The moment equilibrium equation is:\n    $$M_{\\text{add}} = F_m \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right) - F_l \\left(\\frac{w}{2}\\right) = (F_m - F_l) \\frac{w}{2}$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $F_m$ and $F_l$:\n(1) $F_m + F_l = F_c$\n(2) $F_m - F_l = \\frac{2 M_{\\text{add}}}{w}$\n\nTo solve for the medial contact force, $F_m$, we can add the two equations:\n$(F_m + F_l) + (F_m - F_l) = F_c + \\frac{2 M_{\\text{add}}}{w}$\n$2 F_m = F_c + \\frac{2 M_{\\text{add}}}{w}$\nThis gives the calculated medial force:\n$$F_m^{\\text{calc}} = \\frac{F_c}{2} + \\frac{M_{\\text{add}}}{w}$$\n\nA critical aspect of contact mechanics is that contact forces can only be compressive, not tensile. This imposes the physical constraints $F_m \\ge 0$ and $F_l \\ge 0$. From equation (1), the constraint $F_l \\ge 0$ is equivalent to $F_c - F_m \\ge 0$, which implies $F_m \\le F_c$. Therefore, the calculated medial force must be constrained to the physically realistic range $[0, F_c]$. If $F_m^{\\text{calc}}$ falls outside this range, it signifies a non-physical result from the two-contact model (e.g., a tensile force). In such a scenario, one compartment \"lifts off,\" and the other bears the entire load.\n- If $F_m^{\\text{calc}} > F_c$, it implies $F_l  0$, which is impossible. The lateral compartment has lifted off, so we must set $F_l = 0$, which leads to $F_m = F_c$.\n- If $F_m^{\\text{calc}}  0$, which is also impossible. The medial compartment has lifted off, so we must set $F_m = 0$.\nThese physical constraints are enforced by clipping the calculated value:\n$$F_m = \\max(0, \\min(F_c, F_m^{\\text{calc}}))$$\n\nThe validation of the model's prediction, $F_m$, is performed by comparing it to the measured force from an instrumented implant, $F_m^{\\text{meas}}$.\nFor each test case $i$, the error is computed as:\n$$e_i = F_{m,i} - F_{m,i}^{\\text{meas}}$$\nThe validation for a case is successful if the absolute error is within a given tolerance $T_i$:\n$$|e_i| \\le T_i$$\nThe overall model performance across all $n$ test cases is quantified by the root mean square error (RMSE):\n$$\\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n e_i^2}$$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case $(F_{\\text{GRF}}, M_{\\text{add}}, w, \\lambda, F_m^{\\text{meas}}, T)$ is as follows:\n1.  Calculate the total compressive force: $F_c = \\lambda \\cdot F_{\\text{GRF}}$.\n2.  Calculate the unconstrained medial force: $F_m^{\\text{calc}} = \\frac{F_c}{2} + \\frac{M_{\\text{add}}}{w}$.\n3.  Apply physical constraints to find the final predicted medial force: $F_m = \\text{clip}(F_m^{\\text{calc}}, 0, F_c)$.\n4.  Calculate the error $e = F_m - F_m^{\\text{meas}}$ and determine the validation boolean by checking if $|e| \\le T$.\n5.  After processing all $n$ cases, calculate the overall RMSE from the collected errors.\nThe final results—predicted forces, RMSE, and validation booleans—are then reported in the specified format. All forces and the RMSE are rounded to one decimal place.",
