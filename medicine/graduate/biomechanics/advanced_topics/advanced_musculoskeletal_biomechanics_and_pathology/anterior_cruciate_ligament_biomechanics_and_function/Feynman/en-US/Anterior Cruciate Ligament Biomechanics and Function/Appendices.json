Like many biological soft tissues, the ACL exhibits a distinct nonlinear elastic behavior where it becomes progressively stiffer as it is stretched. This practice explores this fundamental property through the lens of continuum mechanics, using a Fung-type exponential strain energy function to model the tissue. By deriving the tensile force from this energy potential, you will gain a hands-on appreciation for how constitutive laws are used to translate material deformation into mechanical loads, a cornerstone of soft tissue biomechanics.

            "problem": "An in situ loading experiment is performed on the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) of a human knee. The ACL is idealized as a one-dimensional, isothermal, purely elastic fiber bundle under quasi-static uniaxial tension, with reference length $L_{0}$ and current length $l$. The engineering strain is defined by $\\epsilon = (l - L_{0})/L_{0}$. Experimental evidence for collagenous soft tissues motivates the use of a Fung-type strain energy function for the ACL bundle, taken here per unit bundle as\n$$\nU(\\epsilon) = \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon)-1-\\alpha\\,\\epsilon\\right],\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a force scale parameter and $\\alpha$ is a dimensionless nonlinearity parameter. At a particular time during the quasi-static ramp, the measured engineering strain is $\\epsilon = 0.06$. The calibrated parameters are $k = 120$ newtons and $\\alpha = 30$.\n\nUsing only the definition of engineering strain and the work-conjugacy between tensile force and length under quasi-static conditions, compute the ACL tensile force $F$ at this strain. Round your answer to $3$ significant figures. Express the force in newtons.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. The model of the Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) as a one-dimensional elastic fiber, the use of a Fung-type strain energy function, and the principle of work-conjugacy are all standard and appropriate concepts in biomechanics. The provided parameters ($k=120$ newtons, $\\alpha=30$, $\\epsilon=0.06$) are physically realistic for this context. The problem is well-defined and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution is pursued.\n\nThe fundamental principle for a one-dimensional, quasi-static, elastic system is that the external force is work-conjugate to the change in length. The infinitesimal work done by the tensile force $F$ during an infinitesimal change in length $\\mathrm{d}l$ is stored as a change in strain energy $\\mathrm{d}U$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}U = F\\,\\mathrm{d}l\n$$\nFrom this, the tensile force $F$ is the derivative of the total strain energy $U$ with respect to the current length $l$:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}l}\n$$\nThe strain energy $U$ is given as a function of the engineering strain $\\epsilon$, not the length $l$. Therefore, the chain rule of differentiation must be applied to find the force:\n$$\nF = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon}{\\mathrm{d}l}\n$$\nWe need to compute the two derivatives on the right-hand side separately.\n\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the strain energy function $U(\\epsilon)$ with respect to the strain $\\epsilon$. The given strain energy function is:\n$$\nU(\\epsilon) = \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon)-1-\\alpha\\,\\epsilon\\right]\n$$\nwhere $k$, $L_{0}$, and $\\alpha$ are constants with respect to $\\epsilon$. Differentiating $U$ with respect to $\\epsilon$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} \\left( \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha}\\left[\\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon)-1-\\alpha\\,\\epsilon\\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} = \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon}(\\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon)) - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon}(1) - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon}(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} = \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha} \\left[ \\alpha\\,\\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) - 0 - \\alpha \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} = \\frac{k\\,L_{0}}{\\alpha} \\left( \\alpha \\left[ \\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) - 1 \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}U}{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon} = k\\,L_{0} \\left[ \\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nNext, we compute the derivative of the engineering strain $\\epsilon$ with respect to the current length $l$. The definition of engineering strain is given as:\n$$\n\\epsilon = \\frac{l - L_{0}}{L_{0}} = \\frac{l}{L_{0}} - 1\n$$\nwhere the reference length $L_{0}$ is a constant. Differentiating $\\epsilon$ with respect to $l$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\epsilon}{\\mathrm{d}l} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}l} \\left( \\frac{l}{L_{0}} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{1}{L_{0}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for the two derivatives back into the chain rule equation for the force $F$:\n$$\nF = \\left( k\\,L_{0} \\left[ \\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) - 1 \\right] \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{L_{0}} \\right)\n$$\nThe reference length $L_{0}$ cancels out, yielding a simple expression for the force as a function of strain:\n$$\nF(\\epsilon) = k \\left[ \\exp(\\alpha\\,\\epsilon) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nThe problem provides the following numerical values for the parameters and strain:\n- Force scale parameter: $k = 120$ newtons\n- Nonlinearity parameter: $\\alpha = 30$\n- Engineering strain: $\\epsilon = 0.06$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $F$:\n$$\nF = 120 \\left[ \\exp(30 \\times 0.06) - 1 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF = 120 \\left[ \\exp(1.8) - 1 \\right]\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the numerical result:\n$$\n\\exp(1.8) \\approx 6.0496475\n$$\n$$\nF \\approx 120 \\left[ 6.0496475 - 1 \\right]\n$$\n$$\nF \\approx 120 \\times 5.0496475\n$$\n$$\nF \\approx 605.9577 \\text{ newtons}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.
