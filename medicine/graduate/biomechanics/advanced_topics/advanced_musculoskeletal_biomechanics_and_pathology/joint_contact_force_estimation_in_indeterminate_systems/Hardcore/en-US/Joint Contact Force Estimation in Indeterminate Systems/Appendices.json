The question is structured to have a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The language is formal, precise, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed based on first principles as requested.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of a rigid body (the proximal femur) in static equilibrium in three-dimensional space. The condition for static equilibrium is that the net force and the net moment (or torque) acting on the body are both zero. This is a direct consequence of Newton's laws of motion, specifically the first law, extended to a rigid body.\n\nThe governing vector equations are:\n$1$. The sum of all external forces acting on the body must be zero.\n$$ \\sum \\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\n$2$. The sum of all external moments (torques) about any arbitrary point $O$ must be zero.\n$$ \\sum \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_O = \\boldsymbol{0} $$\n\nThe problem is specified to be in three-dimensional ($3\\text{D}$) space. To determine the number of independent scalar equations, we resolve these vector equations into their components in a Cartesian coordinate system with orthogonal basis vectors $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}}$, $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}}$, and $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$.\n\nThe force vector $\\boldsymbol{F}$ can be expressed as $\\boldsymbol{F} = F_x \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + F_y \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + F_z \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$, where $F_x$, $F_y$, and $F_z$ are the scalar components of the force along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively. The zero vector $\\boldsymbol{0}$ is $0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$.\n\nThe force equilibrium equation $\\sum \\boldsymbol{F} = \\boldsymbol{0}$ can thus be written as:\n$$ \\left( \\sum F_x \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + \\left( \\sum F_y \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + \\left( \\sum F_z \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} = 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} $$\nFor this vector equality to hold, the scalar coefficient of each basis vector must be equal on both sides of the equation. Since the basis vectors are linearly independent, this yields three independent scalar equations:\n$$ \\sum F_x = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum F_y = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum F_z = 0 $$\n\nSimilarly, the moment vector $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_O$ can be expressed as $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_O = \\tau_x \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + \\tau_y \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + \\tau_z \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}$. The moment equilibrium equation $\\sum \\boldsymbol{\\tau}_O = \\boldsymbol{0}$ becomes:\n$$ \\left( \\sum \\tau_x \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + \\left( \\sum \\tau_y \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + \\left( \\sum \\tau_z \\right) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} = 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\imath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\jmath}} + 0 \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}} $$\nThis vector equation decomposes into another set of three independent scalar equations:\n$$ \\sum \\tau_x = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum \\tau_y = 0 $$\n$$ \\sum \\tau_z = 0 $$\n\nIn total, for any single rigid body in three-dimensional quasi-static equilibrium, there are $3$ force equations and $3$ moment equations, resulting in a minimal and complete set of $3+3=6$ independent scalar equilibrium equations. This answers the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we must determine the degree of indeterminacy, $D$. The degree of indeterminacy is defined as the number of unknown variables minus the number of independent equilibrium equations available to solve for them.\n$$ D = (\\text{Number of Unknowns}) - (\\text{Number of Equations}) $$\n\nFrom the analysis above, the number of independent equations is $6$.\n\nThe number of unknowns must be counted from the problem statement:\n- There are $k$ muscle-tendon units, each exerting an unknown tensile force. Since these are modeled as straight-line actuators, the magnitude of the force is the unknown. This gives $k$ scalar unknowns.\n- The joint contact is modeled by a resultant interaction resolved into $n_c$ unknown scalar components. This gives $n_c$ scalar unknowns.\n- The external loads (e.g., segment weight, ground reaction forces transmitted up the limb) are stated to be known quantities and thus do not contribute to the count of unknowns.\n\nThe total number of unknowns is the sum of the muscle force unknowns and the joint contact component unknowns:\n$$ \\text{Number of Unknowns} = k + n_c $$\n\nSubstituting the number of unknowns and the number of equations into the definition for the degree of indeterminacy, we obtain the closed-form function $D(k, n_c)$:\n$$ D(k, n_c) = (k + n_c) - 6 $$\nThis system is said to be \"statically indeterminate\" when $D > 0$.\n\nFinally, we are asked to evaluate this degree of indeterminacy for the specific case where $k=20$ and $n_c=3$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived function:\n$$ D(20, 3) = (20 + 3) - 6 $$\n$$ D(20, 3) = 23 - 6 $$\n$$ D(20, 3) = 17 $$\n\nThe two quantities requested are the number of independent scalar equilibrium equations and the degree of indeterminacy for the given values.\nThe number of equations is $6$.\nThe degree of indeterminacy is $17$.",

            "problem": "A planar elbow model is considered under quasi-static conditions. An external elbow flexion moment of magnitude $M=20 \\text{ N} \\cdot \\text{m}$ is applied to the forearm. Two monoarticular elbow flexor muscles actuate the joint with perpendicular moment arms $r_1=3 \\text{ cm}$ and $r_2=5 \\text{ cm}$, respectively. Each muscle produces a tensile force $f_1$ and $f_2$ along its line of action on the forearm. The elbow joint contact force $F_c$ is assumed to act through the instantaneous center of rotation of the elbow, producing zero net moment about the elbow.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The system is quasi-static, so linear and angular momentum balances reduce to force and moment equilibrium.\n- Each muscle can only pull, so $f_1 \\geq 0$ and $f_2 \\geq 0$.\n- The lines of action of both muscles are collinear with the forearm axis such that their net effect on translational equilibrium is balanced by $F_c$, and the joint contact force is compressive when it opposes the direction of muscle pull.\n\nThe elbow is mechanically indeterminate with more actuators than required to satisfy the single moment equilibrium. To resolve indeterminacy, determine the muscle forces by solving the static optimization problem that minimizes the sum of squared muscle forces subject to the exact satisfaction of the elbow moment equilibrium. Then, compute the corresponding compressive joint contact force magnitude. Use the following fundamental bases: Newton’s laws for force and moment equilibrium, and an optimization criterion of minimizing $\\sum f_i^2$ subject to the equality constraint from the moment balance.\n\nTasks:\n1.

It is self-contained, consistent, and uses established principles of static equilibrium and optimization to resolve muscular indeterminacy.\n\nThe task is to determine the muscle forces $f_1$ and $f_2$ and the joint contact force $F_c$ in a simplified planar model of the elbow.\n\nFirst, we must ensure all units are consistent within the International System of Units (SI). The external moment is given as $M = 20$ N·m. The muscle moment arms are given in centimeters and must be converted to meters:\n$r_1 = 3$ cm $= 0.03$ m\n$r_2 = 5$ cm $= 0.05$ m\n\n**1. Formulation of the Constrained Optimization Problem**\nThe problem requires finding the muscle forces $f_1$ and $f_2$ that minimize the sum of the squares of the muscle forces. The objective function to minimize is:\n$$J(f_1, f_2) = f_1^2 + f_2^2$$\nThis minimization is subject to two types of constraints:\n1.  **Moment Equilibrium**: The sum of the moments generated by the flexor muscles must equal the required external flexion moment $M$. The joint contact force $F_c$ acts through the center of rotation and thus produces no moment. The moment equilibrium equation is:\n    $$f_1 r_1 + f_2 r_2 = M$$\n2.  **Non-negativity**: Muscles can only pull (generate tensile force), so their forces must be non-negative.\n    $$f_1 \\geq 0$$\n    $$f_2 \\geq 0$$\n\nThe complete constrained optimization problem is therefore:\nMinimize $J = f_1^2 + f_2^2$\nsubject to $f_1 r_1 + f_2 r_2 = M$, $f_1 \\geq 0$, and $f_2 \\geq 0$.\n\n**2. Solution for Optimal Muscle Forces ($f_1, f_2$)**\nThis is a convex optimization problem which can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. We define the Lagrangian function $L$, incorporating the equality constraint with a Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$. We will handle the inequality constraints by verifying the solution at the end.\n$$L(f_1, f_2, \\lambda) = (f_1^2 + f_2^2) + \\lambda(M - f_1 r_1 - f_2 r_2)$$\nTo find the minimum, we take the partial derivatives of $L$ with respect to $f_1$, $f_2$, and $\\lambda$ and set them to zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_1} = 2f_1 - \\lambda r_1 = 0 \\implies f_1 = \\frac{\\lambda r_1}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_2} = 2f_2 - \\lambda r_2 = 0 \\implies f_2 = \\frac{\\lambda r_2}{2}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = M - f_1 r_1 - f_2 r_2 = 0 \\implies f_1 r_1 + f_2 r_2 = M$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $f_1$ and $f_2$ from the first two equations into the third (the constraint equation) to solve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\lambda r_1}{2}\\right)r_1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda r_2}{2}\\right)r_2 = M$$\n$$\\frac{\\lambda}{2}(r_1^2 + r_2^2) = M$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{2M}{r_1^2 + r_2^2}$$\nWith the expression for $\\lambda$, we can find the symbolic solutions for $f_1$ and $f_2$:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{r_1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2M}{r_1^2 + r_2^2} \\right) = \\frac{M r_1}{r_1^2 + r_2^2}$$\n$$f_2 = \\frac{r_2}{2} \\left( \\frac{2M}{r_1^2 + r_2^2} \\right) = \\frac{M r_2}{r_1^2 + r_2^2}$$\nSince $M$, $r_1$, and $r_2$ are all positive, the resulting forces $f_1$ and $f_2$ will be positive, satisfying the non-negativity constraints $f_1 \\geq 0$ and $f_2 \\geq 0$.\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values $M=20$ N·m, $r_1=0.03$ m, and $r_2=0.05$ m to find the forces in Newtons. First, we compute the denominator:\n$$r_1^2 + r_2^2 = (0.03)^2 + (0.05)^2 = 0.0009 + 0.0025 = 0.0034 \\text{ m}^2$$\nNow we compute the forces:\n$$f_1 = \\frac{(20 \\text{ N·m})(0.03 \\text{ m})}{0.0034 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{0.6}{0.0034} \\text{ N} \\approx 176.47058... \\text{ N}$$\n$$f_2 = \\frac{(20 \\text{ N·m})(0.05 \\text{ m})}{0.0034 \\text{ m}^2} = \\frac{1.0}{0.0034} \\text{ N} \\approx 294.11764... \\text{ N}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$f_1 \\approx 176.5$ N\n$f_2 \\approx 294.1$ N\n\n**3. Computation of the Joint Contact Force ($F_c$)**\nThe problem specifies that the system is in quasi-static equilibrium and makes a simplifying assumption for translational equilibrium: \"The lines of action of both muscles are collinear with the forearm axis such that their net effect on translational equilibrium is balanced by $F_c$\". This implies a one-dimensional force balance along the forearm axis. The total tensile force generated by the muscles must be balanced by an opposing compressive force from the joint.\nThe total muscle force is $f_{total} = f_1 + f_2$.\nThe magnitude of the compressive joint contact force $F_c$ is therefore equal to the sum of the magnitudes of the muscle forces:\n$$F_c = f_1 + f_2$$\nUsing the unrounded values for $f_1$ and $f_2$ for precision before the final rounding:\n$$F_c = 176.47058... \\text{ N} + 294.11764... \\text{ N} = 470.58823... \\text{ N}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$F_c \\approx 470.6$ N\n\nThe final numerical results for the three requested quantities, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n$f_1 = 176.5$ N\n$f_2 = 294.1$ N\n$F_c = 470.6$ N\nThese are arranged in a row matrix as requested.",

This also satisfies the non-negativity constraint on muscle forces.\n\nThe force equilibrium equation becomes:\n$$\n0 + 0 + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = F_{\\mathrm{ext}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 1800\n$$\n\nThe moment equilibrium equation becomes:\n$$\nr(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}) + d_1(0) - d_2(0) = M_{\\mathrm{ext}}\n$$\n$$\nr(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}) = M_{\\mathrm{ext}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $r=0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{ext}}=18\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$:\n$$\n0.02(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}) = 18\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = \\frac{18}{0.02} = 900\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two contact multipliers $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}$:\n1. $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 1800$\n2. $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} - \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 900$\n\nAdding the two equations yields:\n$$\n2\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1800 + 900 = 2700\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{2700}{2} = 1350\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nSubstituting $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}$ back into the first equation:\n$$\n1350 + \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 1800\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 1800 - 1350 = 450\\,\\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nNow we must check if these values satisfy the non-negativity constraints for contact forces: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ge 0$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} \\ge 0$.\nSince $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}=1350\\,\\mathrm{N}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}=450\\,\\mathrm{N}$, both are positive, so these constraints are satisfied.\n\nNext, we examine the complementarity conditions.\nFor the medial condyle: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} g_{\\mathrm{m}}(s,\\theta) = 0$. Since $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1350 > 0$, it must be that the gap function is zero: $g_{\\mathrm{m}}(s,\\theta)=0$.\nFor the lateral condyle: $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} g_{\\mathrm{l}}(s,\\theta) = 0$. Since $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 450 > 0$, it must be that the gap function is zero: $g_{\\mathrm{l}}(s,\\theta)=0$.\n\nThis situation corresponds to bilateral contact. The conditions $g_{\\mathrm{m}}=0$ and $g_{\\mathrm{l}}=0$ establish a system of two linear equations for the kinematic variables $s$ and $\\theta$:\n1. $s + c\\theta - \\delta_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0 \\implies s + c\\theta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{m}}$\n2. $s - c\\theta - \\delta_{\\mathrm{l}} = 0 \\implies s - c\\theta = \\delta_{\\mathrm{l}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values $c = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{m \\cdot rad^{-1}}$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{m}} = 0.0015\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\delta_{\\mathrm{l}} = 0.0010\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n1. $s + 0.01\\theta = 0.0015$\n2. $s - 0.01\\theta = 0.0010$\n\nAdding these two equations:\n$$\n2s = 0.0015 + 0.0010 = 0.0025\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{0.0025}{2} = 0.00125\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n$$\n2(0.01\\theta) = 0.0015 - 0.0010 = 0.0005\n$$\n$$\n0.02\\theta = 0.0005\n$$\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{0.0005}{0.02} = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{rad}\n$$\n\nWe have found a complete set of variables: $\\{f_1, f_2, s, \\theta, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}, \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}\\} = \\{0, 0, 0.00125, 0.025, 1350, 450\\}$.\nThis set satisfies the equilibrium equations, the non-negativity constraints ($f_i \\ge 0, \\lambda_j \\ge 0$), and the complementarity conditions ($\\lambda_j g_j = 0$). The gap conditions ($g_j \\ge 0$) are also satisfied as $g_m=0$ and $g_l=0$.\n\nSince the point $(f_1, f_2) = (0, 0)$ is a feasible point for the constrained problem, and this point corresponds to the global minimum of the objective function $J(f_1,f_2)$, this must be the optimal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the contact multipliers $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}$. The values are:\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1350\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 450\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n\nThe problem requests that the final numerical values be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated values are exact integers.\nFor $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}} = 1350$: rounding to four significant figures gives $1350$.\nFor $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}} = 450$: rounding to four significant figures gives $450.0$.\n\nThe final answer is to be provided as a row vector $\\begin{pmatrix}\\lambda_{\\mathrm{m}}  \\lambda_{\\mathrm{l}}\\end{pmatrix}$.",
