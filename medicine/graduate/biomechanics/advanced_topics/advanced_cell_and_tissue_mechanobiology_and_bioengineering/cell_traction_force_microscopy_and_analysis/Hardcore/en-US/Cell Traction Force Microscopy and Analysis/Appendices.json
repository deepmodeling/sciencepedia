            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the smallest reliably reconstructible spatial wavelength in a displacement field measured by two-dimensional Traction Force Microscopy (TFM). The solution must be derived from the first principles of sampling theory, considering two independent sampling constraints: the imaging pixel grid and the spatial distribution of fluorescent beads.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. In the context of spatial signals, this theorem states that to avoid aliasing and reliably reconstruct a continuous, band-limited signal from its discrete samples, the sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest spatial frequency present in the signal. Equivalently, the minimum spatial wavelength, $\\lambda_{min}$, that can be resolved is twice the sampling interval, $\\Delta x$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{min} = 2 \\Delta x\n$$\nThe problem describes two cascaded sampling stages. The overall resolution of the system is limited by the most restrictive stage, which is the one with the lowest sampling density, or equivalently, the largest sampling interval. The effective minimum resolvable wavelength, $\\lambda_{min}$, for the entire system will be the larger of the minimum wavelengths determined by each stage.\n$$\n\\lambda_{min} = \\max(\\lambda_{min,1}, \\lambda_{min,2})\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_{min,1}$ and $\\lambda_{min,2}$ are the limits imposed by the two stages.\n\nLet us analyze each constraint separately.\n\n1.  Constraint from the Imaging Pixel Grid:\nThe first sampling stage is the digital imaging sensor, which samples the optical signal with a spatial interval equal to the effective pixel pitch, $p$.\nThe given value is $p = 0.130$ μm.\nThe sampling interval for this stage is $\\Delta x_{pixel} = p$.\nAccording to the Nyquist criterion, the minimum resolvable wavelength imposed by the pixel grid is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min,pixel} = 2 \\Delta x_{pixel} = 2p\n$$\nSubstituting the given value:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min,pixel} = 2 \\times 0.130 \\text{ μm} = 0.260 \\text{ μm}\n$$\n\n2.  Constraint from the Bead Spatial Distribution:\nThe second sampling stage is the distribution of the fluorescent beads themselves. The displacement field of the substrate is measured only at the locations of these beads. The beads thus act as discrete sampling points for the continuous displacement field.\nThe problem provides the areal number density of the beads, $\\rho = 0.20 \\text{ μm}^{-2}$, and specifies that this distribution can be idealized as a square lattice for the purpose of this analysis.\nFor a square lattice with an inter-bead spacing of $d_{bead}$, the number of beads per unit area is $1 / d_{bead}^2$. This must be equal to the given density $\\rho$.\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{d_{bead}^2}\n$$\nFrom this, we can find the characteristic sampling interval, $d_{bead}$, for the bead distribution.\n$$\nd_{bead} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\n$$\nThis inter-bead distance is the sampling interval for the displacement field, so $\\Delta x_{bead} = d_{bead}$.\nThe minimum resolvable wavelength imposed by the bead distribution is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min,bead} = 2 \\Delta x_{bead} = 2d_{bead} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\rho}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given value for $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min,bead} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{0.20 \\text{ μm}^{-2}}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{0.20}} \\text{ μm}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min,bead} \\approx \\frac{2}{0.44721} \\text{ μm} \\approx 4.4721 \\text{ μm}\n$$\n\nTo determine the smallest spatial wavelength that can be reliably reconstructed for the entire system, we must identify the limiting factor. The overall resolution is constrained by the sparsest sampling, which corresponds to the largest sampling interval.\nThe sampling interval from the pixels is $\\Delta x_{pixel} = 0.130$ μm.\nThe sampling interval from the beads is $\\Delta x_{bead} = 1/\\sqrt{0.20} \\text{ μm} \\approx 2.236$ μm.\nSince $\\Delta x_{bead} > \\Delta x_{pixel}$, the bead distribution is the sparser sampling grid and is, therefore, the limiting factor for the reconstruction of the displacement field. Information about the field's variations at length scales smaller than the inter-bead distance is fundamentally unavailable.\n\nThe smallest resolvable wavelength for the system is the larger of the two minimums:\n$$\n\\lambda_{min} = \\max(\\lambda_{min,pixel}, \\lambda_{min,bead}) = \\max(0.260 \\text{ μm}, 4.4721 \\text{ μm})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{min} = 4.4721... \\text{ μm}\n$$\nThe problem requests the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\lambda_{min} \\approx 4.47 \\text{ μm}\n$$\nThis is the smallest spatial wavelength in the displacement field that can be reliably reconstructed, as it is determined by the Nyquist limit of the bead sampling density, which is the bottleneck in this measurement process.",
