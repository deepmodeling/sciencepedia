            "problem": "Consider a circular epithelial wound of radius $R(t)$ in a two-dimensional (2D) cell sheet adhered to an Extracellular Matrix (ECM). A supracellular actomyosin cable assembles at the wound edge and generates a uniform line tension $\\tau$ (force along the wound edge). Assume overdamped mechanics in which inertia is negligible and the closure dynamics are governed by a balance between the curvature-driven contractile force at the edge and viscous resistance of the surrounding tissue-substrate system. Specifically, take the following assumptions, each of which is grounded in fundamental and widely used principles:\n1. The local geometric curvature of a circle is $\\kappa(t) = 1/R(t)$.\n2. The line tension at the wound edge generates an inward normal stress per unit length $p(t)$ that scales with curvature, with $p(t) = \\tau \\,\\kappa(t)$.\n3. In the overdamped limit, the radial edge velocity is proportional to the inward normal stress, such that $\\frac{dR}{dt} = -M\\,p(t)$, where $M$ is an effective mobility coefficient that lumps cell-substrate friction and tissue viscosity into a linear response relating velocity to edge stress. \n\nStarting from these assumptions and first principles (curvature geometry and linear viscous response in the overdamped regime), explain the role of edge curvature and line tension in determining the wound closure rate, derive the ordinary differential equation governing $R(t)$, and solve for the closure time $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ defined by $R(t_{\\mathrm{c}})=0$, given the initial radius $R(0)=R_0$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid, as it is scientifically grounded in established principles of biomechanics, internally consistent, and well-posed. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem statement provides a set of assumptions that govern the dynamics of wound closure. Let us formalize these into mathematical equations. The wound is a circle of radius $R(t)$.\n\nThe first assumption relates the geometric curvature $\\kappa(t)$ to the radius $R(t)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(t) = \\frac{1}{R(t)}\n$$\nThis is the standard definition of curvature for a circle in two dimensions.\n\nThe second assumption states that the line tension $\\tau$ at the wound edge generates an inward normal stress per unit length, $p(t)$, that is proportional to the curvature:\n$$\np(t) = \\tau \\, \\kappa(t)\n$$\nThis relationship is analogous to the Young-Laplace law, where the line tension $\\tau$ plays the role of a one-dimensional surface tension.\n\nThe third assumption describes the overdamped dynamics, where the radial velocity of the wound edge, $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, is linearly proportional to the driving stress $p(t)$. The negative sign indicates that an inward stress (positive $p(t)$) causes the radius to decrease. The constant of proportionality is the effective mobility coefficient, $M$:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -M \\, p(t)\n$$\n\nTo derive the ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the evolution of the wound radius $R(t)$, we combine these three principles. First, we substitute the expression for curvature $\\kappa(t)$ into the equation for the stress $p(t)$:\n$$\np(t) = \\tau \\left( \\frac{1}{R(t)} \\right) = \\frac{\\tau}{R(t)}\n$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $p(t)$ into the equation for the radial velocity:\n$$\n\\frac{dR}{dt} = -M \\left( \\frac{\\tau}{R(t)} \\right) = -\\frac{M\\tau}{R(t)}\n$$\nThis is the first-order, nonlinear ODE that governs the wound radius $R(t)$.\n\nNow, we can explain the role of edge curvature and line tension. The line tension $\\tau$ is the fundamental contractile parameter generated by the cellular machinery (actomyosin cable). It provides the inherent \"will\" of the wound to close. However, the resulting contractile stress $p(t)$ is not constant; it is modulated by the geometry of the wound edge through the curvature $\\kappa(t) = 1/R(t)$. As the wound closes, its radius $R(t)$ decreases, which causes the curvature $\\kappa(t)$ to increase. Consequently, the inward-pulling stress $p(t) = \\tau/R(t)$ becomes progressively stronger. The closure rate, $|\\frac{dR}{dt}| = M p(t) = M\\tau/R(t)$, is therefore not constant but accelerates as the wound becomes smaller. This geometric feedback mechanism, where decreasing size leads to increased closure stress, is a key feature of this model.\n\nTo find the closure time $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$, we must solve this ODE with the given initial condition $R(0) = R_0$. The equation is separable:\n$$\nR(t) \\, \\frac{dR}{dt} = -M\\tau\n$$\nWe can write this in differential form and integrate both sides from the initial state $(t=0, R=R_0)$ to a general state $(t, R=R(t))$:\n$$\n\\int_{R_0}^{R(t)} R' \\, dR' = \\int_0^t -M\\tau \\, dt'\n$$\nThe parameters $M$ and $\\tau$ are constants with respect to time. Performing the integration gives:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (R')^2 \\right]_{R_0}^{R(t)} = -M\\tau [t']_0^t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} R(t)^2 - \\frac{1}{2} R_0^2 = -M\\tau t\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for $R(t)^2$:\n$$\nR(t)^2 = R_0^2 - 2M\\tau t\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the explicit solution for the radius as a function of time:\n$$\nR(t) = \\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2M\\tau t}\n$$\nWe take the positive root as the radius must be non-negative. This solution describes the radius of the wound decreasing over time.\n\nThe closure time, $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is defined as the time at which the wound is fully closed, i.e., $R(t_{\\mathrm{c}})=0$. We set $R(t)=0$ in our solution and solve for $t=t_{\\mathrm{c}}$:\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{R_0^2 - 2M\\tau t_{\\mathrm{c}}}\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields:\n$$\n0 = R_0^2 - 2M\\tau t_{\\mathrm{c}}\n$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ gives:\n$$\n2M\\tau t_{\\mathrm{c}} = R_0^2\n$$\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{R_0^2}{2M\\tau}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the total time required for the wound to close completely, expressed in terms of the initial radius $R_0$, the line tension $\\tau$, and the effective mobility $M$. The instruction that the closure time should be expressed in seconds confirms that $t_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a physical time quantity, but per the global formatting rules, no units are included in the final boxed expression.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the contractile force per unit length required to achieve a specified wound edge approximation. The problem is set within the framework of linear elasticity for a thin, infinite plate with a central circular hole under plane stress conditions.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing equations for an axisymmetric, quasi-static problem in linear elasticity using polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The only non-zero displacement component is the radial displacement, $u_r(r)$.\n\nThe linear strain-displacement relations are:\n$$\n\\epsilon_r = \\frac{du_r}{dr} \\quad \\text{ (radial strain)}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u_r}{r} \\quad \\text{ (hoop/circumferential strain)}\n$$\n\nThe in-plane equilibrium equation in the radial direction, with no body forces, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_r}{dr} + \\frac{\\sigma_r - \\sigma_\\theta}{r} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_r$ and $\\sigma_\\theta$ are the radial and hoop stress components, respectively.\n\nHooke's law for a homogeneous, isotropic material under plane stress conditions relates strains to stresses:\n$$\n\\epsilon_r = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_r - \\nu \\sigma_\\theta)\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma_\\theta - \\nu \\sigma_r)\n$$\nwhere $E$ is Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio.\n\nWe can combine these equations to obtain a single differential equation for the displacement $u_r(r)$. Expressing stresses in terms of strains and then displacements leads to the Navier-Cauchy equation for this specific problem, which simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2u_r}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{du_r}{dr} - \\frac{u_r}{r^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a Cauchy-Euler ordinary differential equation. The general solution is of the form $u_r(r) = C_1 r + \\frac{C_2}{r}$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nNext, we find the stresses corresponding to this displacement field. We first find the strains:\n$$\n\\epsilon_r = \\frac{du_r}{dr} = C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{u_r}{r} = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n$$\nNow, we use the inverted Hooke's law for plane stress to find the stresses:\n$$\n\\sigma_r = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_r + \\nu \\epsilon_\\theta) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left( C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2} + \\nu\\left(C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}(\\epsilon_\\theta + \\nu \\epsilon_r) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left( C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r^2} + \\nu\\left(C_1 - \\frac{C_2}{r^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 + \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n$$\n\nNow we apply the boundary conditions.\n1.

Applying this to the expression for $\\sigma_r(r)$:\n    $$\n    \\lim_{r\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{r^2} \\right) = 0\n    $$\n    This requires that the constant term be zero, so $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu}C_1 = 0$, which implies $C_1 = 0$.\n\n2.  With $C_1 = 0$, the solutions for displacement and stresses simplify to:\n    $$\n    u_r(r) = \\frac{C_2}{r}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\sigma_r(r) = - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\sigma_\\theta(r) = \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{r^2}\n    $$\n\n3.  At the wound edge, $r=R_0$, there is a uniform inward normal traction due to the contractile actomyosin ring. Let the magnitude of this pressure be $p  0$. An inward traction corresponds to a compressive (negative) radial stress. Thus, the boundary condition at the wound edge is $\\sigma_r(R_0) = -p$.\n    $$\n    -p = - \\frac{E}{1+\\nu}\\frac{C_2}{R_0^2}\n    $$\n    We can solve for the constant $C_2$:\n    $$\n    C_2 = \\frac{p R_0^2 (1+\\nu)}{E}\n    $$\n\nSubstituting $C_2$ back into the displacement equation gives:\n$$\nu_r(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{p R_0^2 (1+\\nu)}{E} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the inward radial displacement at the wound edge ($r=R_0$) is $-\\alpha R_0$. Let's evaluate our expression for $u_r$ at $r=R_0$:\n$$\nu_r(R_0) = \\frac{p R_0 (1+\\nu)}{E}\n$$\nThis displacement is positive (outward), which corresponds to an outward pressure $p$. The problem describes an inward contractile force, which we modeled with a radial stress $\\sigma_r(R_0) = -p$. To obtain an inward (negative) displacement, the pressure $p$ in the standard formula must be considered negative. Let's denote the magnitude of the inward (contractile) pressure as $p_{contractile}$. Then the applied stress is $\\sigma_r(R_0) = -p_{contractile}$. The corresponding displacement is:\n$$\nu_r(R_0) = - \\frac{p_{contractile} R_0 (1+\\nu)}{E}\n$$\nWe equate this to the specified target displacement, $u_r(R_0) = -\\alpha R_0$:\n$$\n-\\alpha R_0 = - \\frac{p_{contractile} R_0 (1+\\nu)}{E}\n$$\nSolving for the pressure magnitude $p_{contractile}$:\n$$\np_{contractile} = \\frac{\\alpha E}{1+\\nu}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the contractile force per unit length, let's call it $F_L$. It states that this line tension, acting over the sheet thickness $h$, generates the pressure $p_{contractile}$. Therefore, the pressure is the force per unit length divided by the thickness:\n$$\np_{contractile} = \\frac{F_L}{h}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $p_{contractile}$:\n$$\n\\frac{F_L}{h} = \\frac{\\alpha E}{1+\\nu}\n$$\nSolving for $F_L$, we obtain the final symbolic expression:\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{\\alpha E h}{1+\\nu}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $\\alpha = 0.20$\n- $E = 3.0 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $h = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\nu = 0.45$\n\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{(0.20)(3.0 \\times 10^5 \\ \\text{Pa})(1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{m})}{1 + 0.45}\n$$\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{0.20 \\times 3.0 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^{(5-3)}}{1.45} \\ \\text{N/m}\n$$\n$$\nF_L = \\frac{0.72 \\times 10^2}{1.45} \\ \\text{N/m} = \\frac{72}{1.45} \\ \\text{N/m}\n$$\n$$\nF_L \\approx 49.6551724... \\ \\text{N/m}\n$$\nFinally, rounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\nF_L \\approx 49.66 \\ \\text{N/m}\n$$\nNote that the initial wound radius $R_0$ is not needed for the final calculation of $F_L$, as it cancels out when relating edge displacement to the pressure.",

The problem states that the fiber orientations are axisymmetric about $\\mathbf{a}$ and gives the orientation dispersion parameter $p = \\langle P_{2}(\\cos\\theta)\\rangle$, where $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2-1)$ and $\\theta$ is the angle between a fiber direction $\\mathbf{n}$ and the mean direction $\\mathbf{a}$.\nGiven $p=0.50$, we find $s = \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle$:\n$$\np = \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2}(3\\cos^2\\theta - 1) \\right\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}(3\\langle\\cos^2\\theta\\rangle - 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(3s - 1)\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{2p+1}{3} = \\frac{2(0.50)+1}{3} = \\frac{1+1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}\n$$\nThe second-order orientation tensor $\\mathbf{A}$ for a transversely isotropic distribution is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = s\\,\\mathbf{a}\\otimes \\mathbf{a}+\\alpha_{t}\\left(\\mathbf{I}-\\mathbf{a}\\otimes \\mathbf{a}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_t = \\frac{1-s}{2}$.\n$$\n\\alpha_t = \\frac{1 - 2/3}{2} = \\frac{1/3}{2} = \\frac{1}{6}\n$$\nIn the coordinate system with $\\mathbf{a}=\\mathbf{e}_1$, the matrix representation of $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} s  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\alpha_t  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\alpha_t \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2/3  0  0 \\\\ 0  1/6  0 \\\\ 0  0  1/6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we use the provided quadratic closure for the fourth-order orientation tensor $\\mathbf{M}$:\n$$\nM_{ijkl} = \\frac{1}{7}\\left(A_{ij}A_{kl}+A_{ik}A_{jl}+A_{il}A_{jk}\\right)\n$$\nWe need to compute the components $M_{1111} = M_{aaaa}$ and $M_{2222} = M_{tttt}$.\nFor $M_{aaaa}$:\n$$\nM_{aaaa} = M_{1111} = \\frac{1}{7}(A_{11}A_{11} + A_{11}A_{11} + A_{11}A_{11}) = \\frac{3}{7}A_{11}^2\n$$\nSubstituting $A_{11}=s=2/3$:\n$$\nM_{aaaa} = \\frac{3}{7}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{21}\n$$\nFor $M_{tttt}$:\n$$\nM_{tttt} = M_{2222} = \\frac{1}{7}(A_{22}A_{22} + A_{22}A_{22} + A_{22}A_{22}) = \\frac{3}{7}A_{22}^2\n$$\nSubstituting $A_{22}=\\alpha_t=1/6$:\n$$\nM_{tttt} = \\frac{3}{7}\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)^2 = \\frac{3}{7} \\cdot \\frac{1}{36} = \\frac{1}{7 \\cdot 12} = \\frac{1}{84}\n$$\nNow we can compute the effective moduli using the given parameters: $E_{m}=0.05~\\text{MPa}$, $E_{f}=50~\\text{MPa}$, and $\\phi=0.12$.\nThe modulus along the preferred fiber direction, $E_{\\parallel}$:\n$$\nE_{\\parallel} = (1-0.12)(0.05) + (0.12)(50)\\left(\\frac{4}{21}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\parallel} = (0.88)(0.05) + 6\\left(\\frac{4}{21}\\right) = 0.044 + \\frac{24}{21} = 0.044 + \\frac{8}{7}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\parallel} \\approx 0.044 + 1.142857... = 1.186857...~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $E_{\\parallel} = 1.187~\\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe modulus transverse to the preferred fiber direction, $E_{\\perp}$:\n$$\nE_{\\perp} = (1-0.12)(0.05) + (0.12)(50)\\left(\\frac{1}{84}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\perp} = (0.88)(0.05) + 6\\left(\\frac{1}{84}\\right) = 0.044 + \\frac{6}{84} = 0.044 + \\frac{1}{14}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\perp} \\approx 0.044 + 0.07142857... = 0.11542857...~\\text{MPa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $E_{\\perp} = 0.1154~\\text{MPa}$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing $E_{\\parallel}$ and $E_{\\perp}$ in MPa.",
