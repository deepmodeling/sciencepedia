The shear stress component $\\tau_{rz}$ is given by the constitutive relation for a Newtonian fluid:\n$$\n\\tau_{rz}(r) = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r}\n$$\nThe axial velocity profile is given as $u(r) = U \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^{2}\\right)$.

We evaluate the expression for $\\tau_{rz}(r)$ at $r=R$:\n$$\n\\tau_w = \\tau_{rz}|_{r=R} = -\\frac{2\\mu U R}{R^2} = -\\frac{2\\mu U}{R}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the fluid drag force on the wall is directed opposite to the flow (in the negative $z$-direction).\n\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into the expression for $\\tau_w$:\n-   $\\mu = 3.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$\n-   $U = 1.2 \\times 10^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n-   $R = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\n$$\n\\tau_w = -\\frac{2 (3.2 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.2 \\times 10^{-1})}{9.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = -\\frac{7.68 \\times 10^{-4}}{9.0 \\times 10^{-4}} \\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_w = -0.85333... \\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as instructed, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_w \\approx -0.8533 \\ \\mathrm{Pa}\n$$\nThe second objective is to estimate the mechanotransduction signaling amplitude, $A$. The model is given by $A = \\beta |\\tau_w|$.

The provided values are physically realistic for a biological system.\n\nThe first step is to derive an expression for the nuclear Young's modulus, $E_{n}$. The problem states that the nucleus is to be treated as a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic solid.

This relationship can be written as:\n$$\\sigma_{n} = cT$$\nThe coefficient $c$ encapsulates complex geometric factors and the efficiency of force transmission through the cytoskeleton, particularly via the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, which physically connects the cytoskeleton to the nuclear lamina.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $\\sigma_{n}$ into the definition of $E_{n}$, we obtain the desired expression for the nuclear Young's modulus in terms of the given parameters:\n$$E_{n} = \\frac{cT}{\\epsilon_{n}}$$\nThis completes the derivation part of the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate $E_{n}$ using the experimentally measured values provided:\n- Substrate traction magnitude, $T = 6.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$\n- Axial nuclear strain, $\\epsilon_{n} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-2}$ (dimensionless)\n- Mechanotransmission coefficient, $c = 0.35$ (dimensionless)\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$E_{n} = \\frac{(0.35) \\times (6.50 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{Pa})}{1.8 \\times 10^{-2}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, which represents the transmitted nuclear stress, $\\sigma_{n}$:\n$$\\sigma_{n} = 0.35 \\times 650\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 227.5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nNow, we can calculate $E_{n}$:\n$$E_{n} = \\frac{227.5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{0.018} \\approx 12638.89\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in kilopascals ($\\mathrm{kPa}$) and rounded to three significant figures.

Let $g(F) = 5 \\exp(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}) - 5000 \\exp(\\frac{-0.4 F}{4.114}) - 1$. We need to find the root of $g(F)=0$. The function $g(F)$ is monotonically increasing for $F > 0$, so a unique positive root exists.\n\nLet $y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}\\right)$. Then the equation becomes $5y - 5000y^{-4} - 1 = 0$, or $5y^5 - y^4 - 5000 = 0$. Using a numerical root-finding method (such as Newton's method or bisection), we find the unique positive real root to be $y \\approx 4.02276$.\n\nNow, we solve for $F$:\n$y = \\exp\\left(\\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}\\right) \\implies \\ln(y) = \\frac{0.1 F}{4.114}$\n$$ F = \\frac{4.114}{0.1} \\ln(y) = 41.14 \\ln(4.02276) $$\n$$ F \\approx 41.14 \\times 1.39198 \\approx 57.258 \\ \\mathrm{pN} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to $3$ significant figures.\n$$ F_{1/2} \\approx 57.3 \\ \\mathrm{pN} $$\nThis force $F_{1/2}$ represents the critical tension at which the dominant rupture pathway switches from the low-affinity state to the high-affinity state. This switch is characteristic of a catch bond mechanism, where the bond lifetime first increases with force before eventually decreasing.",
