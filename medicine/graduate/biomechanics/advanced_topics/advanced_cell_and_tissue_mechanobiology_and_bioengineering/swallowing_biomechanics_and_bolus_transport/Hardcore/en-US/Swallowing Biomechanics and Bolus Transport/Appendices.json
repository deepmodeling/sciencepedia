            "problem": "A cohesive food bolus residing between the anterior tongue surface and the hard palate is commonly modeled as a yield-stress fluid following the Herschel–Bulkley (HB) constitutive law. The HB relation for the shear stress is given by $\\tau=\\tau_{y}+K\\dot{\\gamma}^{n}$, where $\\tau$ is shear stress, $\\tau_{y}$ is the yield stress, $K$ is the consistency index, $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate, and $n$ is the flow index. Consider the onset of bolus transport during the oral phase of swallowing, when the tongue generates a pressure drop $p$ over an effective anterior–posterior contact length $L$, with the bolus confined to a thin film of half-gap $h$ between the tongue and palate. Under thin-film lubrication conditions and static onset (negligible inertia), the wall shear stress $\\tau$ is related to the pressure drop $p$ across the contact length $L$ and the half-gap $h$ by the approximation $\\tau \\approx \\frac{p \\cdot h}{L}$. Assume gravity is negligible relative to the tongue-generated pressure and that the bolus is initially at rest.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and the HB relation, derive the minimum required pressure drop $p_{\\text{min}}$ that will initiate flow in the bolus. Express your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\tau_{y}$, $K$, $n$, $L$, and $h$. The expression should be valid at the instant of flow initiation under the stated assumptions. Express the minimum pressure drop in Pascals. No numerical evaluation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum pressure drop, $p_{\\text{min}}$, necessary to initiate flow in a cohesive food bolus modeled as a Herschel–Bulkley (HB) fluid.\n\nFirst, we state the given Herschel–Bulkley relation for the shear stress $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\tau_{y} + K\\dot{\\gamma}^{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{y}$ is the yield stress, $K$ is the consistency index, $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the shear rate, and $n$ is the flow index. A fundamental property of a yield-stress fluid is that it remains rigid (no flow, $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$) as long as the applied shear stress is less than the yield stress ($\\tau < \\tau_{y}$). Flow is initiated at the exact moment the applied shear stress reaches the yield stress. Therefore, the minimum condition for flow to begin is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\tau_{y}\n$$\nAt this threshold, the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is still zero, as flow has just begun. Substituting $\\dot{\\gamma}=0$ into the HB equation confirms that the stress required is exactly the yield stress: $\\tau = \\tau_y + K(0)^n = \\tau_y$. This demonstrates that the post-yield parameters $K$ and $n$ are not relevant for determining the pressure at the moment of flow initiation.\n\nNext, we use the physical relationship between the wall shear stress $\\tau$, the pressure drop $p$ over a length $L$, and the channel half-gap $h$, which is derived from lubrication theory:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{p \\cdot h}{L}\n$$\nTo find the minimum pressure drop, $p_{\\text{min}}$, required to initiate flow, we must generate a wall shear stress equal to the yield stress, $\\tau_y$. We substitute $\\tau = \\tau_y$ and $p = p_{\\text{min}}$ into the stress-pressure relation:\n$$\n\\tau_{y} = \\frac{p_{\\text{min}} \\cdot h}{L}\n$$\nThe final step is to solve this equation for $p_{\\text{min}}$. Multiplying both sides by $L$ and dividing by $h$, we obtain the expression for the minimum required pressure drop:\n$$\np_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{L\\tau_{y}}{h}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the minimum pressure needed to make the bolus yield and begin to flow. This result is physically intuitive: a higher pressure is needed to move a bolus with higher yield stress ($\\tau_y$) or over a longer distance ($L$), while less pressure is needed for a wider gap ($h$). The units are consistent: if $\\tau_y$ is in Pascals ($Pa$), and $L$ and $h$ are in meters ($m$), then $p_{\\text{min}}$ will be in Pascals, as required.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. It requests the calculation of the Deborah number for a viscoelastic bolus undergoing transport and an interpretation of the result. All provided parameters are physically plausible for the process of swallowing. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we identify the given parameters:\nThe material relaxation time, a characteristic of the bolus's viscoelastic properties, is $\\lambda = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe characteristic transit speed of the bolus is $U = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.\nThe characteristic length scale of the pharyngeal constriction is $L = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe problem requires us to start from first principles of kinematics to determine the relevant process timescale, denoted as $t_p$. The process in question is the transport of the bolus material across the constriction. The time required for a material element to travel a distance $L$ at a constant characteristic speed $U$ is given by the fundamental kinematic relation:\n$$\nt_p = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThis timescale, $t_p$, represents the duration over which the material is subjected to deformation as it passes through the constriction.\n\nNext, we use the definition of the Deborah number, $De$. The Deborah number is a dimensionless quantity in rheology used to characterize how \"fluid-like\" or \"solid-like\" a material behaves under specific flow conditions. It is defined as the ratio of the material's intrinsic relaxation time, $\\lambda$, to the characteristic timescale of the observation or process, $t_p$.\n$$\nDe = \\frac{\\lambda}{t_p}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the process timescale $t_p$ into the definition of the Deborah number, we obtain the formula for $De$ in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\left(\\frac{L}{U}\\right)} = \\frac{\\lambda U}{L}\n$$\n\nNow, we can compute the numerical value for $De$ by substituting the given values into this expression.\n$$\nDe = \\frac{(0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (0.3\\,\\mathrm{m/s})}{0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\nDe = \\frac{0.06\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 3\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the answer should be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, the dimensionless Deborah number is $3.000$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the magnitude of the calculated Deborah number, $De = 3$. The Deborah number compares the timescale of material stress relaxation ($\\lambda$) with the timescale of the flow-induced deformation ($t_p = L/U$).\n- If $De \\ll 1$, the material relaxation is much faster than the process timescale. The material has ample time to adjust to the deformation, and it behaves as a viscous fluid. Elastic effects are negligible.\n- If $De \\gg 1$, the process is much faster than the material can relax. The material does not have time to flow, and its response is dominated by elasticity, similar to a solid.\n- If $De \\approx 1$, the relaxation time and the process time are of a similar order of magnitude. The material exhibits significant viscoelastic behavior, where both viscous (energy dissipation) and elastic (energy storage) effects are important.\n\nIn this case, $De = 3$. Since this value is greater than $1$, it indicates that the material relaxation time ($\\lambda = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$) is longer than the timescale of the bolus transit through the constriction ($t_p = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m} / 0.3\\,\\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 0.067\\,\\mathrm{s}$). The flow process is rapid relative to the material's ability to relax internal stresses. Consequently, elastic effects are expected to be significant. The bolus will not behave as a simple viscous liquid; it will store a portion of the deformation energy as elastic energy. This stored energy and the associated elastic stresses can influence the pressure required for transport and could potentially lead to phenomena like elastic recoil upon exiting the constriction. The bolus transport dynamics are therefore firmly in the viscoelastic regime, where a purely viscous model would be inadequate.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and kinematics, specifically using a simplified plug-flow model common in biomechanical analysis. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary data provided and a clear objective. There are no internal contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the minimal UES opening duration, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}}$, which is defined as the time interval from the onset of UES relaxation, $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, to the moment the bolus tail completely clears the UES plane, $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}$. All times are measured relative to the swallow command at $t=0$. The required duration is therefore given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}} = t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}} - t_{\\mathrm{rel}}\n$$\nTo find $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}}$, we must first calculate $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}$. This requires a step-by-step analysis based on the conservation of mass and kinematics of the bolus.\n\nFirst, we determine the physical properties of the bolus based on the provided data. The model is a one-dimensional plug flow, which treats the bolus as a cylindrical column of fluid with a constant cross-sectional area, $A$, and length, $L_b$.\n\nThe cross-sectional area $A$ is dependent on the pharyngeal pressure. The pressure during bolus transport is given as $p_{\\mathrm{bolus}}=45\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$ above a baseline of $p_{\\mathrm{rest}}=5\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}$. The effective pressure distending the pharynx is the difference:\n$$\n\\Delta p = p_{\\mathrm{bolus}} - p_{\\mathrm{rest}} = 45\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} - 5\\ \\mathrm{mmHg} = 40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}\n$$\nThe cross-sectional area $A$ is given by the linear compliance relation:\n$$\nA = A_{\\mathrm{rest}} + C \\cdot \\Delta p\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $A_{\\mathrm{rest}}=0.80\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ and $C=0.020\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}/\\mathrm{mmHg}$:\n$$\nA = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2} + (0.020\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{cm}^{2}}{\\mathrm{mmHg}}) \\cdot (40\\ \\mathrm{mmHg}) = 0.80\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2} + 0.80\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2} = 1.60\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}\n$$\nThe bolus volume is given as $V_{b}=10\\ \\mathrm{mL}$, which is equivalent to $10\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}$. Assuming the bolus forms a column of constant cross-sectional area $A$, its length, $L_b$, can be calculated from the volume:\n$$\nV_{b} = A \\cdot L_b \\implies L_b = \\frac{V_{b}}{A}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nL_b = \\frac{10\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{3}}{1.60\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{2}} = 6.25\\ \\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nNext, we establish a kinematic timeline. Let the tongue-base sensor be at the origin $x=0$, and the UES be at position $x=L=6.0\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. The bolus front travels at a constant speed $v_{b}=20\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}$.\n\nThe bolus front passes the tongue base ($x=0$) at time $t_{\\mathrm{TB}}=0.10\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The time it takes for the bolus front to travel the distance $L$ to reach the UES is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{travel}} = \\frac{L}{v_{b}} = \\frac{6.0\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{20\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe absolute time at which the bolus front arrives at the UES, $t_{\\mathrm{front, UES}}$, is:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{front, UES}} = t_{\\mathrm{TB}} + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{travel}} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.30\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem states that safe passage requires the UES to be open when the bolus front arrives. The UES opens at $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}=0.15\\ \\mathrm{s}$. Since $t_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 0.15\\ \\mathrm{s}  0.40\\ \\mathrm{s} = t_{\\mathrm{front, UES}}$, the UES is already open when the bolus arrives, so the safety condition is met.\n\nThe bolus tail clears the UES plane at a time $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}$. In the plug-flow model, the bolus tail follows the front by the fixed length $L_b$. The time it takes for the entire bolus length to pass a fixed point (like the UES plane) is the passage time, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{passage}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{passage}} = \\frac{L_b}{v_{b}} = \\frac{6.25\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{20\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}} = 0.3125\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe time the bolus tail clears the UES is the time the front arrives plus this passage time:\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}} = t_{\\mathrm{front, UES}} + \\Delta t_{\\mathrm{passage}} = 0.40\\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.3125\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.7125\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nAlternatively, we can express $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}$ from first principles. The total distance traveled by the bolus front from the tongue base until the bolus tail clears the UES is $L + L_b$. The total time for this transit is $(L + L_b)/v_b$. This transit starts at $t_{\\mathrm{TB}}$.\n$$\nt_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}} = t_{\\mathrm{TB}} + \\frac{L + L_b}{v_b} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s} + \\frac{6.0\\ \\mathrm{cm} + 6.25\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{20\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s} + \\frac{12.25\\ \\mathrm{cm}}{20\\ \\mathrm{cm/s}} = 0.10\\ \\mathrm{s} + 0.6125\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.7125\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result for $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the minimal UES opening duration, $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}}$. This is the interval from the onset of UES relaxation, $t_{\\mathrm{rel}}=0.15\\ \\mathrm{s}$, until the bolus tail clears the UES at $t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}}=0.7125\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}} = t_{\\mathrm{tail, UES}} - t_{\\mathrm{rel}} = 0.7125\\ \\mathrm{s} - 0.15\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.5625\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{UES}} \\approx 0.563\\ \\mathrm{s}\n$$",
