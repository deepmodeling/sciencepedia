            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the spring constant for an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) cantilever, modeled as an Euler–Bernoulli beam, followed by a numerical calculation and an uncertainty analysis.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the effective end stiffness, $k$. The cantilever is modeled as a uniform beam of length $L$, clamped at $x=0$ and free at $x=L$. A transverse point force $F$ is applied at the free end, $x=L$. The deflection of the beam is denoted by $w(x)$. According to Euler–Bernoulli beam theory, for small deflections, the relationship between the bending moment $M(x)$ and the curvature of the beam $\\frac{d^2w}{dx^2}$ is given by:\n$$E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = M(x)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young’s modulus of the material and $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section.\n\nFor a cantilever beam with a point load $F$ at its free end, the bending moment at a position $x$ along the beam's length (where $0 \\le x \\le L$) can be found by considering the static equilibrium of the beam segment from $x$ to $L$. Summing moments about the point $x$ gives:\n$$M(x) = F(L-x)$$\nSubstituting this into the beam equation yields:\n$$E I \\frac{d^2w}{dx^2} = F(L-x)$$\nTo find the deflection, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$. The first integration gives the slope of the beam, $\\frac{dw}{dx}$:\n$$E I \\frac{dw}{dx} = \\int F(L-x) dx = F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) + C_1$$\nThe constant of integration $C_1$ is determined by the boundary condition at the clamped end ($x=0$), where the slope must be zero: $\\frac{dw}{dx}(0) = 0$.\n$$E I (0) = F(0) + C_1 \\implies C_1 = 0$$\nThus, the equation for the slope is:\n$$E I \\frac{dw}{dx} = F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right)$$\nIntegrating a second time gives the deflection $w(x)$:\n$$E I w(x) = \\int F \\left(Lx - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) dx = F \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right) + C_2$$\nThe constant $C_2$ is determined by the boundary condition that the deflection at the clamped end ($x=0$) is zero: $w(0)=0$.\n$$E I (0) = F(0) + C_2 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\nThe deflection profile of the cantilever is therefore:\n$$w(x) = \\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{Lx^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\right)$$\nThe deflection at the free end, $\\delta$, is found by evaluating $w(x)$ at $x=L$:\n$$\\delta = w(L) = \\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{L(L^2)}{2} - \\frac{L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{F}{EI} \\left(\\frac{3L^3 - L^3}{6}\\right) = \\frac{FL^3}{3EI}$$\nThe effective end stiffness, $k$, is defined by the linear relationship $F = k\\delta$. Rearranging the expression for $\\delta$ gives:\n$$k = \\frac{F}{\\delta} = \\frac{3EI}{L^3}$$\nFor a rectangular cross-section of width $b$ and thickness $t$, the second moment of area $I$ is given by $I = \\frac{bt^3}{12}$. Substituting this into the expression for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{3E \\left(\\frac{bt^3}{12}\\right)}{L^3} = \\frac{Ebt^3}{4L^3}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the effective end stiffness.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the mean stiffness, $\\bar{k}$, using the provided nominal geometric dimensions and the mean value of the Young's modulus, $\\bar{E}$. The given values are:\n$L = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$b = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$t = 2.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\bar{E} = 160\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1.60 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}$\n\nThe mean stiffness $\\bar{k}$ is:\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{\\bar{E}bt^3}{4L^3} = \\frac{(1.60 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{N/m^2}) (2 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{4(1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}$$\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{(1.60 \\times 10^{11}) (2 \\times 10^{-5}) (8 \\times 10^{-18})}{4(1 \\times 10^{-12})} \\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\n$$\\bar{k} = \\frac{25.6 \\times 10^{-12}}{4 \\times 10^{-12}} \\,\\mathrm{N/m} = 6.4\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$$\nAs requested, rounding to four significant figures, the computed stiffness is $6.400\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n\nNow, we estimate the fractional standard uncertainty in $k$, which is defined as $\\sigma_k/\\bar{k}$. The problem states that this uncertainty arises solely from the variability in $E$, so we treat $L$, $b$, and $t$ as exact constants.\nThe relationship is $k(E) = C \\cdot E$, where $C = \\frac{bt^3}{4L^3}$ is a constant.\nUsing the standard formula for propagation of uncertainty for a function of a single variable, the variance of $k$, $\\sigma_k^2$, is related to the variance of $E$, $\\sigma_E^2$, by:\n$$\\sigma_k^2 = \\left(\\frac{dk}{dE}\\right)^2 \\sigma_E^2$$\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dk}{dE} = C$. Thus, $\\sigma_k^2 = C^2 \\sigma_E^2$, and the standard deviation is $\\sigma_k = C \\sigma_E$.\nThe mean stiffness is $\\bar{k} = C \\bar{E}$.\nThe fractional uncertainty in $k$ is therefore:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_k}{\\bar{k}} = \\frac{C \\sigma_E}{C \\bar{E}} = \\frac{\\sigma_E}{\\bar{E}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a linear relationship, the fractional uncertainty in the output ($k$) is equal to the fractional uncertainty in the input ($E$).\nUsing the given values $\\bar{E} = 160\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$ and $\\sigma_E = 15\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_k}{\\bar{k}} = \\frac{15\\,\\mathrm{GPa}}{160\\,\\mathrm{GPa}} = \\frac{15}{160} = \\frac{3}{32}$$\n\nFinally, we discuss why empirical calibration methods are preferred over relying on nominal geometry and tabulated $E$. The derived formula $k = \\frac{Ebt^3}{4L^3}$ shows that the stiffness is highly sensitive to the geometric dimensions, particularly the thickness $t$ (cubic dependence, $k \\propto t^3$) and the length $L$ (inverse cubic dependence, $k \\propto L^{-3}$). Microfabrication processes inevitably introduce deviations from the nominal dimensions, and these small geometric uncertainties are amplified significantly in the calculated stiffness. For instance, a mere $5\\%$ error in measuring the cantilever thickness $t$ would result in an uncertainty of approximately $3 \\times 5\\% = 15\\%$ in $k$. Furthermore, the Young's modulus $E$ is also subject to variability due to factors like crystal orientation, surface effects, and processing conditions, as highlighted by the non-zero $\\sigma_E$ given in the problem. The cumulative uncertainty from all these parameters makes the theoretical calculation of $k$ from design specifications unreliable for quantitative applications demanding high accuracy. Empirical calibration methods (e.g., thermal noise method, Sader method) circumvent this problem by measuring the cantilever's mechanical response directly. This provides a single, experimentally determined value for $k$ that implicitly accounts for the actual, combined effects of the cantilever's true geometry and material properties, leading to a far more accurate and reliable stiffness value.",

            "solution": "(a) Determination of the minimum sampling rate $f_s$.\n\nThe motion of the bead in one dimension, say $x$, is described by the overdamped Langevin equation for a particle in a harmonic potential:\n$$\n\\gamma \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} = -k x(t) + F_{th}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the hydrodynamic drag coefficient, $k$ is the trap stiffness, $x(t)$ is the bead's displacement from the trap center, and $F_{th}(t)$ is the stochastic thermal force due to collisions with fluid molecules.

The fluctuation-dissipation theorem states that the PSD of the thermal force is white noise, with a one-sided spectrum given by $S_{F_{th}}(f) = 4\\gamma k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Therefore, the PSD of the position is:\n$$\nS_x(f) = \\frac{S_{F_{th}}(f)}{|k + i2\\pi f \\gamma|^2} = \\frac{4\\gamma k_B T}{k^2 + (2\\pi f \\gamma)^2}\n$$\nThis function has a Lorentzian shape.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be developed by following the four tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Viscous Drag on the Cantilever Body**\n\nThe drag on the rectangular cantilever body arises from the shearing of the fluid in the gap of height $h$. The problem specifies that this can be modeled as a parallel-plate Couette flow.\n\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the shear stress $\\tau$ is linearly proportional to the shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$. The constitutive relation in one dimension is:\n$$\n\\tau = \\eta \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nIn a simple Couette flow between two parallel plates separated by a distance $h$, where one plate is stationary and the other moves with speed $v$, the velocity profile $u(z)$ across the gap (with $z$ being the coordinate normal to the plates) is linear under creeping-flow conditions:\n$$\nu(z) = v \\frac{z}{h}\n$$\nwhere $z=0$ at the stationary plate (sample) and $z=h$ at the moving plate (cantilever).\n\nThe shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the gradient of the velocity:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma} = \\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz}\\left(v \\frac{z}{h}\\right) = \\frac{v}{h}\n$$\nThe shear rate is constant throughout the fluid gap. The resulting shear stress on the bottom surface of the cantilever is therefore also uniform:\n$$\n\\tau = \\eta \\left(\\frac{v}{h}\\right)\n$$\nThe drag force is the shear stress integrated over the area on which it acts. For the rectangular cantilever of length $L$ and width $w$, the planform area is $A_{\\mathrm{cant}} = Lw$. The drag force on the cantilever body, $F_{\\mathrm{drag, cant}}$, is:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag, cant}} = \\tau \\cdot A_{\\mathrm{cant}} = \\left(\\frac{\\eta v}{h}\\right) (Lw)\n$$\n\n**2. Viscous Drag on the Spherical Tip Apex**\n\nThe problem requires starting from the steady Stokes flow solution for a sphere. For a sphere of radius $R$ moving at a constant velocity $v$ through a quiescent, unbounded Newtonian fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ at low Reynolds number, the drag force is given by Stokes' law:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag, tip}} = 6 \\pi \\eta R v\n$$\nThis formula represents the fundamental solution. While corrections exist for the presence of a nearby planar wall (Faxén's laws), the problem asks to start from the basic Stokes solution, which is the standard approach in the absence of explicit instructions to include wall effects. This approximation is reasonable if the sphere is not in close proximity to the surface, i.e., the gap is not significantly smaller than the radius $R$.\n\n**3. Total Hydrodynamic Drag**\n\nThe problem states that linear superposition of the drag contributions is valid. Therefore, the total hydrodynamic drag, $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$, is the sum of the drag on the cantilever body and the drag on the spherical tip:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag}} = F_{\\mathrm{drag, cant}} + F_{\\mathrm{drag, tip}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag}} = \\frac{\\eta L w v}{h} + 6 \\pi \\eta R v\n$$\nWe can factor out the common terms $\\eta$ and $v$ to obtain a consolidated expression for the total drag:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{drag}} = \\eta v \\left(\\frac{Lw}{h} + 6 \\pi R\\right)\n$$\nThis expression shows that the total hydrodynamic drag is linearly proportional to the scanning speed $v$. The term in the parentheses is the effective hydrodynamic drag coefficient, $\\gamma$.\n\n**4. Isolation of the Interaction Force**\n\nThe measured force, $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, is the total force opposing the motion, which is the sum of the hydrodynamic drag $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$ and the tip-sample interaction force $F_{\\mathrm{int}}$. We assume these forces are collinear with the direction of motion and that $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$, and $F_{\\mathrm{int}}$ represent the magnitudes of the retarding forces.\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{meas}}(v) = F_{\\mathrm{drag}}(v) + F_{\\mathrm{int}}(v)\n$$\nThe hydrodynamic drag $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$ is explicitly dependent on speed $v$, as derived. The interaction force $F_{\\mathrm{int}}$ (e.g., kinetic friction) may also exhibit a dependency on speed, often logarithmic or a weak power law in many physical systems.\n\nThe proposed experimental protocol to isolate $F_{\\mathrm{int}}$ leverages the linear dependence of $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$ on $v$.\n-   Measure the total lateral force $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ at a series of different scanning speeds $v_i$.\n-   Plot the measured force $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}(v_i)$ against the speed $v_i$.\n-   The equation $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}(v) = \\left(\\frac{\\eta Lw}{h} + 6 \\pi R\\right) v + F_{\\mathrm{int}}(v)$ suggests that if $F_{\\mathrm{int}}(v)$ is constant or varies much more slowly with $v$ than the linear drag term, the plot will be approximately linear.\n-   A linear fit to the $F_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ vs. $v$ data, $F_{\\mathrm{fit}} = m v + b$, yields the drag coefficient as the slope $m$ and the zero-speed interaction force $F_{\\mathrm{int}}(v \\to 0)$ as the y-intercept $b$.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"speed-corrected interaction force,\" which we denote as $F_{\\mathrm{corr}}$. This is the measured force with the calculated hydrodynamic drag at that speed subtracted. It represents the best estimate of the true tip-sample interaction force, $F_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{corr}} = F_{\\mathrm{meas}} - F_{\\mathrm{drag}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expression for $F_{\\mathrm{drag}}$:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{corr}} = F_{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\eta v \\left(\\frac{Lw}{h} + 6 \\pi R\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the corrected interaction force in terms of the given parameters.",
