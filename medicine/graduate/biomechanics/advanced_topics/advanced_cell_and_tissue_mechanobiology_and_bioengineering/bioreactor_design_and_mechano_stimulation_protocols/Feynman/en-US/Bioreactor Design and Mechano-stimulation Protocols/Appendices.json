The gauge length is $L_0 = 20\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The actuator drives the system quasi-statically (frequency sufficiently low that inertial effects are negligible). The load path consists of the following elements in series: the upper grip, the lower grip, the bioreactor frame, a load cell, and a polymer coupler, each modeled as a linear spring with stiffnesses $k_{\\mathrm{g1}} = 1.5 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{g2}} = 2.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{f}} = 1.2 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $k_{\\mathrm{lc}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, and $k_{\\mathrm{c}} = 8.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, respectively.

For fully developed laminar flow in a straight channel (let the direction of flow be $x$) between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $H$ (the $y$-direction), the Navier-Stokes equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\mu \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} $$\nwhere $u(y)$ is the velocity profile in the $x$-direction, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. The pressure gradient $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is constant for fully developed flow. Let's arrange the coordinate system such that the bottom wall is at $y=0$ and the top wall is at $y=H$.\n\nThe equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nWe integrate this equation twice with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y + C_1 $$\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined by the no-slip boundary conditions at the walls:\n$1.$ $u(0) = 0$\n$2.$ $u(H) = 0$\n\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$ u(0) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (0)^2 + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$ u(H) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} H^2 + C_1 H = 0 \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nSubstituting the constants back into the velocity equation gives the parabolic velocity profile:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y^2 - \\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} (y^2 - Hy) $$\nSince the flow is driven by pressure, the pressure must decrease along the flow direction, meaning $\\frac{dp}{dx} < 0$. The resulting velocity is positive.\n\nNext, we relate the pressure gradient to the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The shear stress $\\tau_{yx}$ is given by the Newtonian constitutive relation:\n$$ \\tau_{yx}(y) = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy} $$\nUsing our expression for $\\frac{du}{dy}$:\n$$ \\tau_{yx}(y) = \\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} y - \\frac{H}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left( y - \\frac{H}{2} \\right) $$\nThe wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, is the magnitude of the shear stress at either wall.

Therefore, the value is $50.0$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the mechanobiological implications of this result. A Péclet number of $Pe = 50.0$ is significantly greater than $1$. This indicates that advection is the dominant mechanism of mass transport for the growth factor compared to diffusion along the length of the pore.\nMechanobiologically, this has important consequences.\n$1$. **Non-uniform Solute Distribution**: The strong advective flow will rapidly carry the growth factor along the pore. If cells lining the pore walls consume the growth factor, a steep concentration gradient will be established along the pore axis ($x$-direction). Cells at the upstream end of the pore (inlet) will be exposed to a high concentration of the growth factor, while cells at the downstream end will be exposed to a significantly depleted concentration.\n$2$. **Heterogeneous Cell Response**: This concentration gradient can lead to spatially heterogeneous cellular responses within the scaffold. For instance, cells in the high-concentration upstream region might proliferate or differentiate differently than cells in the low-concentration downstream region. This can result in non-uniform tissue growth and is a critical consideration in bioreactor design and operation protocols aimed at achieving homogeneous tissue constructs.\nIn summary, a high Péclet number signifies advection-dominated transport, which warns of potential steep concentration gradients and heterogeneous cell stimulation within the porous scaffold.",
