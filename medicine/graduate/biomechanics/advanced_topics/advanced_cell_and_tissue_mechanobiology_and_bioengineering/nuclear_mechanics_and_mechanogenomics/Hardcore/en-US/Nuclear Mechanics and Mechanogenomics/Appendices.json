Assume linear elasticity and that these networks experience the same macroscopic strain so that their shear stresses add. The hydrophilic nuclear material is approximately incompressible under the deformations considered. Let the effective nuclear shear modulus be the sum of a chromatin contribution and a lamina contribution, and let the nuclear elastic (Young’s) modulus be related to the shear modulus through isotropic linear elasticity.\n\nThe chromatin network shear modulus is modeled by rubber elasticity as proportional to the thermal energy scale and the crosslink density, with the crosslink density taken to be proportional to the measured chromatin compaction fraction. Specifically, assume the chromatin shear modulus is given by $G_{\\mathrm{chrom}} = k_{B} T \\nu_{0} \\phi$, where $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\nu_{0}$ is a proportionality constant with units of inverse volume that maps the compaction fraction to the effective crosslink density, and $\\phi$ is the measured chromatin compaction fraction.\n\nEmpirically, the lamina network shear modulus contribution is taken to scale linearly with the normalized Lamin A/C level, yielding $G_{\\mathrm{lam}} = \\gamma_{L} L$, where $\\gamma_{L}$ is a proportionality constant (with units of pressure) and $L$ is the normalized lamin level.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the bias introduced in the estimation of Young's modulus when an incorrect Poisson's ratio is assumed. The physical scenario is an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) spherical indentation test on a cell nucleus, which is modeled as an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. The analysis will be based on the principles of linear elastic contact mechanics.\n\nThe relationship between the applied force $F$ and the indentation depth $d$ for a rigid spherical indenter of radius $R$ on a linear elastic half-space is given by the Hertz model for small indentations ($d \\ll R$):\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\nwhere $E^*$ is the reduced modulus of the system.

The expression for $E^*$ becomes:\n$$E^* = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the Hertz force equation gives the model used for data fitting:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\nIn a typical experiment, force $F$ and indentation $d$ are measured. The data are then fitted to this model to determine the Young's modulus $E$. However, this requires a value for the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\nThe problem states that the investigators assume the nucleus is incompressible, which corresponds to an assumed Poisson's ratio of $\\nu_{a} = 0.5$. Using this assumption, they fit the experimental data and obtain a reported Young's modulus, which we denote as $E_{\\text{assumed}}$. The governing equation they use for fitting is:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}}}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\n\nHowever, the true Poisson's ratio of the nucleus is given as $\\nu_{t} = 0.35$.

The relative bias is approximately $-14.5\\%$. This underestimation occurs because assuming incompressibility ($\\nu_a=0.5$) implies the material is more resistant to volume-preserving deformation than it truly is, leading to a smaller calculated stiffness modulus to account for the measured force-indentation curve. The mathematical factor $(1 - \\nu^2)$ is $0.75$ for $\\nu=0.5$ and approximately $0.8775$ for $\\nu=0.35$. Since $E = E_{\\text{apparent}} \\times (1 - \\nu^2)$, using a smaller factor ($0.75$) results in a smaller estimated modulus.\n\nThe calculated values are $c = 1.170$ and $\\delta = -0.1453$.",
