However, extracting a physical parameter like Young's modulus from raw force-indentation data requires fitting to a theoretical model, which is built on certain assumptions.

            "problem": "A spherical indentation assay using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is performed on isolated cell nuclei to estimate the Young’s modulus. The nucleus is modeled as an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. Investigators commonly assume incompressibility with Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{a} = 0.5$ when fitting the force–indentation data to a standard linear elastic contact model for small strains. However, suppose the true Poisson’s ratio of the nucleus is $\\nu_{t} = 0.35$. Using only standard linear elasticity and axisymmetric contact mechanics as the fundamental base, derive how the assumption of incompressibility biases the modulus estimate and quantify the bias. Specifically:\n- Define the multiplicative correction factor $c$ that converts the reported modulus $E_{\\text{assumed}}$ (obtained by fitting with $\\nu_{a}$) to the true modulus $E_{\\text{true}}$, so that $E_{\\text{true}} = c \\, E_{\\text{assumed}}$.\n- Define the relative bias $\\delta = \\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}} - E_{\\text{true}}}{E_{\\text{true}}}$.\nCompute $c$ and $\\delta$ for $\\nu_{a} = 0.5$ and $\\nu_{t} = 0.35$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the bias introduced in the estimation of Young's modulus when an incorrect Poisson's ratio is assumed. The physical scenario is an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) spherical indentation test on a cell nucleus, which is modeled as an isotropic, homogeneous, linear elastic half-space. The analysis will be based on the principles of linear elastic contact mechanics.\n\nThe relationship between the applied force $F$ and the indentation depth $d$ for a rigid spherical indenter of radius $R$ on a linear elastic half-space is given by the Hertz model for small indentations ($d \\ll R$):\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} E^* \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\nwhere $E^*$ is the reduced modulus of the system. The reduced modulus $E^*$ is defined as:\n$$\\frac{1}{E^*} = \\frac{1 - \\nu_{\\text{indenter}}^2}{E_{\\text{indenter}}} + \\frac{1 - \\nu_{\\text{sample}}^2}{E_{\\text{sample}}}$$\nIn AFM experiments on soft biological samples like a cell nucleus, the indenter (typically made of silicon or silicon nitride) is significantly stiffer than the sample ($E_{\\text{indenter}} \\gg E_{\\text{sample}}$). Therefore, the compliance of the indenter is negligible, and the term $(1 - \\nu_{\\text{indenter}}^2)/E_{\\text{indenter}}$ approaches zero. The reduced modulus simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{1}{E^*} \\approx \\frac{1 - \\nu_{\\text{sample}}^2}{E_{\\text{sample}}}$$\nLet $E$ and $\\nu$ represent the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the sample (the nucleus). The expression for $E^*$ becomes:\n$$E^* = \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the Hertz force equation gives the model used for data fitting:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E}{1 - \\nu^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\nIn a typical experiment, force $F$ and indentation $d$ are measured. The data are then fitted to this model to determine the Young's modulus $E$. However, this requires a value for the Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n\nThe problem states that the investigators assume the nucleus is incompressible, which corresponds to an assumed Poisson's ratio of $\\nu_{a} = 0.5$. Using this assumption, they fit the experimental data and obtain a reported Young's modulus, which we denote as $E_{\\text{assumed}}$. The governing equation they use for fitting is:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}}}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\n\nHowever, the true Poisson's ratio of the nucleus is given as $\\nu_{t} = 0.35$. The actual physical response of the nucleus is governed by its true material properties, $E_{\\text{true}}$ and $\\nu_{t}$. Therefore, the same measured force $F$ can also be described by:\n$$F = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{true}}}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\n\nSince both equations describe the same experimentally measured force for a given indentation depth, we can equate them:\n$$\\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}}}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2} = \\frac{4}{3} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\text{true}}}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} \\right) \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$$\nThe common terms $\\frac{4}{3} \\sqrt{R} d^{3/2}$ cancel, leading to the core relationship:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}}}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2} = \\frac{E_{\\text{true}}}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2}$$\n\nThe first task is to find the multiplicative correction factor $c$ such that $E_{\\text{true}} = c \\, E_{\\text{assumed}}$. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for $E_{\\text{true}}$ in terms of $E_{\\text{assumed}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{true}} = E_{\\text{assumed}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\nu_{t}^2}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2} \\right)$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $E_{\\text{true}} = c \\, E_{\\text{assumed}}$, we can identify the correction factor $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{1 - \\nu_{t}^2}{1 - \\nu_{a}^2}$$\n\nThe second task is to find the relative bias $\\delta$, defined as $\\delta = \\frac{E_{\\text{assumed}} - E_{\\text{true}}}{E_{\\text{true}}}$. We can substitute the expression for $E_{\\text{assumed}}$ from our derived relationship, $E_{\\text{assumed}} = E_{\\text{true}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\nu_{a}^2}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} \\right)$, into the definition of $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{E_{\\text{true}} \\left( \\frac{1 - \\nu_{a}^2}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} \\right) - E_{\\text{true}}}{E_{\\text{true}}}$$\nFactoring out and canceling $E_{\\text{true}}$ (which must be non-zero) yields:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1 - \\nu_{a}^2}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} - 1$$\nThis can be simplified by combining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{(1 - \\nu_{a}^2) - (1 - \\nu_{t}^2)}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2} = \\frac{\\nu_{t}^2 - \\nu_{a}^2}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2}$$\nAlternatively, noting that $\\frac{1}{c} = \\frac{1 - \\nu_{a}^2}{1 - \\nu_{t}^2}$, we can write $\\delta = \\frac{1}{c} - 1$.\n\nNow we can compute the numerical values for $c$ and $\\delta$ using the given values $\\nu_{a} = 0.5$ and $\\nu_{t} = 0.35$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the correction factor $c$:\n$$c = \\frac{1 - (0.35)^2}{1 - (0.5)^2} = \\frac{1 - 0.1225}{1 - 0.25} = \\frac{0.8775}{0.75} = 1.17$$\nTo represent this with four significant figures, we write $1.170$.\n\nNext, we calculate the relative bias $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1}{c} - 1 = \\frac{1}{1.17} - 1 = \\frac{0.75}{0.8775} - 1$$\n$$\\delta \\approx 0.8547008547... - 1 = -0.145299145...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\delta = -0.1453$.\n\nThe assumed modulus $E_{\\text{assumed}}$ is an underestimation of the true modulus $E_{\\text{true}}$, since $E_{\\text{assumed}} = E_{\\text{true}}/c = E_{\\text{true}}/1.17$. The relative bias is approximately $-14.5\\%$. This underestimation occurs because assuming incompressibility ($\\nu_a=0.5$) implies the material is more resistant to volume-preserving deformation than it truly is, leading to a smaller calculated stiffness modulus to account for the measured force-indentation curve.\n\nThe calculated values are $c = 1.170$ and $\\delta = -0.1453$.",
