A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Activation Function $a([Ca])$**\n\nThe problem specifies a cooperative binding reaction at equilibrium:\n$$R + n\\,Ca \\rightleftharpoons R\\cdot Ca_{n}$$\nwhere $R$ is the inactive state of the activator, $Ca$ is calcium, and $R\\cdot Ca_{n}$ is the activated complex.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the equilibrium dissociation constant, $K_d$, for this reaction is given by:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R] [Ca]^n}{[R\\cdot Ca_{n}]}$$\nwhere $[R]$, $[Ca]$, and $[R\\cdot Ca_{n}]$ are the molar concentrations of the respective species at equilibrium.\n\nThe total concentration of the activator, $[R]_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the concentrations of its inactive and active forms:\n$$[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [R\\cdot Ca_{n}]$$\nThe activation, $a([Ca])$, is defined as the fraction of the activator that is in the bound (activated) state:\n$$a([Ca]) = \\frac{[R\\cdot Ca_{n}]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nFrom this definition, we can express the concentrations of the bound and unbound forms in terms of $a([Ca])$ and $[R]_{\\text{total}}$:\n$$[R\\cdot Ca_{n}] = a([Ca]) \\cdot [R]_{\\text{total}}$$\n$$[R] = [R]_{\\text{total}} - [R\\cdot Ca_{n}] = [R]_{\\text{total}} (1 - a([Ca]))$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation for the dissociation constant $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R]_{\\text{total}} (1 - a([Ca])) [Ca]^n}{a([Ca]) \\cdot [R]_{\\text{total}}}$$\nThe term $[R]_{\\text{total}}$ cancels out:\n$$K_d = \\frac{(1 - a([Ca])) [Ca]^n}{a([Ca])}$$\nWe now solve this equation for $a([Ca])$:\n$$a([Ca]) K_d = (1 - a([Ca])) [Ca]^n$$\n$$a([Ca]) K_d = [Ca]^n - a([Ca]) [Ca]^n$$\n$$a([Ca]) K_d + a([Ca]) [Ca]^n = [Ca]^n$$\n$$a([Ca]) (K_d + [Ca]^n) = [Ca]^n$$\n$$a([Ca]) = \\frac{[Ca]^n}{K_d + [Ca]^n}$$\nThis is the general form of the Hill equation. The problem provides an additional constraint to define the constants. The characteristic concentration $K$ is defined such that $a([Ca]=K) = \\frac{1}{2}$. We substitute $[Ca]=K$ into our derived expression for $a([Ca])$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{K^n}{K_d + K^n}$$\n$$K_d + K^n = 2 K^n$$\n$$K_d = K^n$$\nThis result relates the equilibrium dissociation constant $K_d$ to the given characteristic concentration $K$. Substituting $K_d = K^n$ back into the expression for $a([Ca])$ yields the final form of the activation function:\n$$a([Ca]) = \\frac{[Ca]^n}{K^n + [Ca]^n}$$\nThis expression can be rewritten as $a([Ca]) = \\frac{([Ca]/K)^n}{1 + ([Ca]/K)^n}$, which clearly satisfies the given boundary conditions: as $[Ca] \\to 0$, $a([Ca]) \\to 0$; and as $[Ca] \\to \\infty$, $a([Ca]) \\to 1$.\n\n**Part 2: Evaluation of Activation $a([Ca])$**\n\nWe are given $n=3$ and $K=0.3$ micromolar ($\\mu\\text{M}$). The activation function becomes:\n$$a([Ca]) = \\frac{[Ca]^3}{(0.3)^3 + [Ca]^3}$$\nUnits for $[Ca]$ and $K$ must be consistent, which they are ($\\mu\\text{M}$).\n\nCase 1: $[Ca] = 0.2 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$\n$$a(0.2) = \\frac{(0.2)^3}{(0.3)^3 + (0.2)^3} = \\frac{0.008}{0.027 + 0.008} = \\frac{0.008}{0.035} = \\frac{8}{35}$$\n\nCase 2: $[Ca] = 0.3 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$\nAs per the definition of $K$, since $[Ca] = K$, the activation must be $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n$$a(0.3) = \\frac{(0.3)^3}{(0.3)^3 + (0.3)^3} = \\frac{(0.3)^3}{2(0.3)^3} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nCase 3: $[Ca] = 0.6 \\, \\mu\\text{M}$\n$$a(0.6) = \\frac{(0.6)^3}{(0.3)^3 + (0.6)^3} = \\frac{0.216}{0.027 + 0.216} = \\frac{0.216}{0.243} = \\frac{216}{243}$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $27$ ($216 = 8 \\times 27$ and $243 = 9 \\times 27$):\n$$a(0.6) = \\frac{8}{9}$$\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Active Stress $\\sigma^{\\text{act}}$**\n\nThe active stress is given by $\\sigma^{\\text{act}} = \\sigma_{\\max} \\, a([Ca])$, with $\\sigma_{\\max} = 120 \\, \\text{kPa}$.

The provided parameters are physically realistic for a small airway.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of the required hoop tension to maintain equilibrium; second, the determination of the available hoop tension from muscle activation; and third, the calculation of the stability margin.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of Required Hoop Tension ($T_{\\text{req}}$)\nWe analyze the static equilibrium of a half-cylinder segment of unit axial length, $L=1$. The airway is subjected to an internal pressure $P$ and an external pressure $P_{e}$. The problem's stability criterion is related to the airway resisting an \"external-internal pressure difference,\" which implies we are concerned with the case where $P_e > P$, leading to a net compressive load on the airway. The net pressure acting inward on the cylinder is $\\Delta P = P_e - P$.\n\nThis net pressure exerts a force, $F_{\\text{pressure}}$, on the projected diametral area of the half-cylinder segment. For a cylinder of radius $r$ and unit length $L=1$, this projected area is $A_{\\text{proj}} = (2r) \\times L = 2r$.\nThe total inward force per unit length is thus:\n$$F_{\\text{pressure}} = \\Delta P \\times A_{\\text{proj}} = (P_e - P) \\times 2r$$\nThis inward-directed force must be balanced by an outward-directed force generated by the hoop tension, $T_{\\text{req}}$, in the airway wall. Hoop tension is defined as force per unit axial length (units of $\\mathrm{N/m}$). For the half-cylinder, this tension acts at the two cut edges. The total restoring force from the wall, $F_{\\text{wall}}$, is:\n$$F_{\\text{wall}} = 2 \\times T_{\\text{req}} \\times L = 2T_{\\text{req}}$$\nFor equilibrium, $F_{\\text{wall}} = F_{\\text{pressure}}$:\n$$2T_{\\text{req}} = (P_e - P) 2r$$\nSolving for the required hoop tension gives the expression:\n$$T_{\\text{req}} = (P_e - P)r$$\nThis is the magnitude of the tensile hoop tension the wall must sustain to prevent collapse under the net external pressure.\n\nPart 2: Determination of Available Hoop Tension ($T_{\\text{avail}}$)\nThe airway smooth muscle generates a uniform active circumferential stress, $\\sigma^{\\text{act}}$, across the wall thickness $t$. Stress is defined as force per unit area. To find the available hoop tension, $T_{\\text{avail}}$, we consider the total force generated by this stress over the wall's cross-section, per unit axial length.\nFor a segment of unit axial length, the cross-sectional area of the wall resisting the hoop force is $A_{\\text{wall}} = t \\times L = t$. The total force generated by the muscle in this segment is $F_{\\text{muscle}} = \\sigma^{\\text{act}} A_{\\text{wall}} = \\sigma^{\\text{act}} t$.\nThis force, by definition, is the available hoop tension (force per unit length):\n$$T_{\\text{avail}} = \\sigma^{\\text{act}}t$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Stability Margin ($M$)\nThe stability margin, $M$, is defined as the difference between the available active hoop tension and the required hoop tension:\n$$M = T_{\\text{avail}} - T_{\\text{req}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$M = \\sigma^{\\text{act}}t - (P_e - P)r$$\nWe are given the following parameters.
