            "problem": "A mechanosensitive channel in the two-pore domain potassium channel family, TWIK-related potassium channel $1$ (TREK-$1$), is embedded in a cell membrane under lateral membrane tension. Consider a minimal two-state gating model (closed and open states) in thermal equilibrium. The open and closed state occupancies follow Boltzmann statistics at temperature $T$, and the free energy difference between the open and closed states is additively coupled to the membrane tension $\\gamma$ via the mechanical work term.

The use of Boltzmann statistics for a two-state system in thermal equilibrium is a fundamental principle of statistical mechanics. The assumption of a linear coupling between free energy and membrane tension is a standard and physically justified approximation. All aspects are scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary information to perform the derivation and subsequent calculation. The objective is clearly stated, and the path to a unique solution is well-defined.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.\n\n**Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the relationship between the log-odds of the open state and the membrane tension. In a two-state system with a closed state ($C$) and an open state ($O$), the probabilities of occupying each state, $P_C$ and $P_O$, are given by their respective Boltzmann weights:\n$$P_O = \\frac{\\exp(-G_O / (k_B T))}{Z}$$\n$$P_C = \\frac{\\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))}{Z}$$\nwhere $G_O$ and $G_C$ are the free energies of the open and closed states, respectively, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Z = \\exp(-G_O / (k_B T)) + \\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))$ is the partition function.\n\nThe odds of the open state are the ratio of the probability of being open to the probability of being closed, $P_O / P_C$. Since the system must be in one of the two states, $P_O + P_C = 1$, which means $P_C = 1 - P_O$. The odds can therefore be written as $P_O / (1-P_O)$. Using the Boltzmann expressions:\n$$\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O} = \\frac{P_O}{P_C} = \\frac{\\exp(-G_O / (k_B T))}{\\exp(-G_C / (k_B T))} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_O - G_C}{k_B T}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nHere, $\\Delta G = G_O - G_C$ is the free energy difference between the open and closed states.\n\nThe problem states that this free energy difference is additively coupled to the membrane tension $\\gamma$. The work done on the channel by the membrane tension when it changes its in-plane area by $\\Delta A = A_O - A_C$ is $W = -\\gamma \\Delta A$. This mechanical work contributes to the free energy difference. Thus, the total free energy difference $\\Delta G$ as a function of tension $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A$$\nwhere $\\Delta G_0$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at zero tension ($\\gamma=0$). Substituting this expression back into the equation for the odds gives:\n$$\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nTo find the linear relationship, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{P_O}{1-P_O}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T} = -\\frac{\\Delta G_0}{k_B T} + \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T}$$\nThis equation is of the form $y = mx + c$, where $y = \\ln\\!\\big(P_{o}/(1-P_{o})\\big)$, the independent variable is the tension $x = \\gamma$, the y-intercept is $c = -\\Delta G_0/(k_B T)$, and the slope is $m = \\Delta A / (k_B T)$. This completes the derivation, confirming the linear dependence.\n\nThe second part of the task is to calculate the effective area change, $\\Delta A$, using the experimentally measured slope $s_{\\gamma}$. From our derivation, the slope is:\n$$s_{\\gamma} = \\frac{\\Delta A}{k_B T}$$\nWe can solve for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\\Delta A = s_{\\gamma} k_B T$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$s_{\\gamma} = 2.05 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\left(\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\\right)^{-1}$\n$T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal energy, $k_B T$:\n$$k_B T = (1.380\\,649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx 4.11433 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta A$:\n$$\\Delta A = \\left(2.05 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\left(\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\\right)^{-1}\\right) \\times (4.11433 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J})$$\nTo verify the units, we recall that a Joule is a unit of work or energy, $1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$. The units of the calculation are:\n$$\\left(\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}\\right)^{-1} \\times \\mathrm{J} = \\mathrm{N}^{-1}\\mathrm{m} \\times (\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}) = \\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe resulting unit is square meters, which is a unit of area, as expected.\n\nPerforming the numerical calculation:\n$$\\Delta A = (2.05 \\times 10^{3}) \\times (4.11433 \\times 10^{-21})\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 8.43438 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$$\nThe problem requires the answer in square nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}^2$). We use the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^9\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, which implies $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = (10^9\\,\\mathrm{nm})^2 = 10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n$$\\Delta A \\approx (8.43438 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{18}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2}{1\\,\\mathrm{m}^2}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 8.43438\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$$\nFinally, rounding the result to $3$ significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta A \\approx 8.43\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$$",

It tests a clear understanding of statistical mechanics applied to a biological system.\n\n#### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe free energy difference between the open and closed states of a mechanosensitive channel under membrane tension $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$ \\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - W_{\\text{mech}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta G_0$ is the intrinsic free energy difference at zero tension, and $W_{\\text{mech}} = \\gamma \\Delta A$ is the mechanical work done by the tension $\\gamma$ acting over the area expansion $\\Delta A$. Thus,\n$$ \\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A $$\nAccording to Boltzmann statistics for a two-state system, the probability of the channel being open, $P_{\\text{open}}$, is:\n$$ P_{\\text{open}}(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{\\Delta G(\\gamma) / k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{(\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A) / k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}} $$\nA key quantity is the exponent, which is a dimensionless energy. Let us express all energies in units of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$. The work term $\\gamma \\Delta A$ must be converted to Joules to be compared with $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$.\nGiven $\\gamma$ in $\\mathrm{mN/m}$ and $\\Delta A$ in $\\mathrm{nm}^2$:\n$$ \\gamma \\Delta A = (\\gamma \\,[\\mathrm{mN/m}]) \\times (\\Delta A \\,[\\mathrm{nm}^2]) \\times (10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2) = (\\gamma \\Delta A) \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nWe are given $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\approx 4.1 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}$. Therefore, the work term in units of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\approx \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}}{4.1 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J}} = \\frac{\\gamma \\Delta A}{4.1} $$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is in $\\mathrm{mN/m}$ and $\\Delta A$ is in $\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n\nA useful metric for channel activation is the tension at which the open and closed states are equally probable ($P_{\\text{open}} = 0.5$), which occurs when $\\Delta G(\\gamma) = 0$. This midpoint activation tension, $\\gamma_{\\text{mid}}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta G_0 = \\gamma_{\\text{mid}} \\Delta A \\implies \\gamma_{\\text{mid}} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0}{\\Delta A} $$\nLet's calculate $\\gamma_{\\text{mid}}$ for each channel.\n\nFor MscS:\n$\\Delta G_{0,\\mathrm{S}} = 14\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ and $\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{S}} = 8\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{mid,S}} = \\frac{14\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{8\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} = \\frac{14 \\times (4.1 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J})}{8 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{57.4 \\times 10^{-21}}{8 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\mathrm{J/m}^2 = 7.175 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{J/m}^2 = 7.175 \\,\\mathrm{mN/m} $$\n\nFor MscL:\n$\\Delta G_{0,\\mathrm{L}} = 50\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ and $\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{L}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$.\n$$ \\gamma_{\\text{mid,L}} = \\frac{50\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{20\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2} = \\frac{50 \\times (4.1 \\times 10^{-21} \\,\\mathrm{J})}{20 \\times 10^{-18} \\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{205 \\times 10^{-21}}{20 \\times 10^{-18}} \\, \\mathrm{J/m}^2 = 10.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{J/m}^2 = 10.25 \\,\\mathrm{mN/m} $$\nThese calculations confirm that MscS activates at a significantly lower tension than MscL ($\\gamma_{\\text{mid,S}}  \\gamma_{\\text{mid,L}}$).\n\nNow we analyze the behavior in the specified tension regimes:\n\n1.  **Moderate regime ($\\gamma \\in [6,8]\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$):**\n    This range of tensions is centered around the activation threshold of MscS ($\\gamma_{\\text{mid,S}} \\approx 7.2\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$). Within this regime, the open probability of MscS, $P_{\\text{open,S}}$, will increase steeply from a low value to a high value. For example, at $\\gamma = 7.175\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$, $P_{\\text{open,S}} = 0.5$.\n    For MscL, this tension range is far below its activation threshold of $\\gamma_{\\text{mid,L}} = 10.25\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$. The free energy of opening for MscL will still be large and positive. At $\\gamma = 8\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$ (the upper end of the range):\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{L}}(8\\,\\mathrm{mN/m})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = \\frac{\\Delta G_{0,\\mathrm{L}}}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} - \\frac{8 \\times \\Delta A_{\\mathrm{L}}}{4.1} = 50 - \\frac{8 \\times 20}{4.1} = 50 - 39.02 = 10.98 $$\n    $P_{\\text{open,L}} = (1+e^{10.98})^{-1} \\approx 1.7 \\times 10^{-5}$. This is negligible.\n    Therefore, in the moderate tension regime, MscS is the primary active channel, and thus \"dominates\" gating.\n\n2.  **Extreme regime ($\\gamma \\in [12,14]\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$):**\n    This tension range is well above the activation thresholds for both channels.\n    For MscS at $\\gamma = 12\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{S}}(12\\,\\mathrm{mN/m})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = 14 - \\frac{12 \\times 8}{4.1} = 14 - 23.41 = -9.41 $$\n    $P_{\\text{open,S}} = (1+e^{-9.41})^{-1} \\approx 0.99992$.\n    For MscL at $\\gamma = 12\\,\\mathrm{mN/m}$:\n    $$ \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{L}}(12\\,\\mathrm{mN/m})}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = 50 - \\frac{12 \\times 20}{4.1} = 50 - 58.54 = -8.54 $$\n    $P_{\\text{open,L}} = (1+e^{-8.54})^{-1} \\approx 0.9998$.\n    At these extreme tensions, the open probability for both channels approaches $1$. Thermodynamically, both channels are strongly favored to be open. According to the problem's definition, \"dominates\" requires higher $P_{\\text{open}}$ and faster activation. As both $P_{\\text{open}}$ values are nearly $1$, the deciding factor would be activation speed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nA. **$\\Delta A_{\\mathrm{L}}  \\Delta A_{\\mathrm{S}}$, $\\Delta G_{0,\\mathrm{L}}  \\Delta G_{0,\\mathrm{S}}$.

By the strict definition (\"higher $P_{\\text{open}}$ and faster activation\"), if MscL is slower to activate, it cannot dominate. However, in a physiological context, \"dominance\" at extreme tension falls to MscL, the \"large conductance\" channel, which acts as a safety valve to prevent cell lysis and whose total ion flux would dwarf that of MscS. Given that the other options are patently incorrect on the basic parameters, this option provides the best and most complete physical and biological description.

            "problem": "Consider a mechanosensitive ion channel modeled as a two-state system (closed and open) under membrane tension. Assume thermal equilibrium at a fixed absolute temperature $T$, and that the open probability $P_o$ follows from statistical mechanics under a free energy difference between open and closed states. Let the free energy difference be given by $\\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\,\\Delta A$, where $\\gamma$ is the membrane tension, $\\Delta G_0$ is the free energy difference at zero tension, and $\\Delta A$ is the change in in-plane membrane area upon opening. The probability of the channel being open is given by $P_o(\\gamma) = \\dfrac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta G(\\gamma)}{k_B T}\\right)}$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nStarting from fundamental thermodynamic definitions and equilibrium statistical mechanics, derive an estimation procedure for $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$ that uses binary opening statistics collected at discrete tensions. Assume that at each tension value $\\gamma_i$, one observes $n_i$ independent trials, each yielding an open or closed state, with $x_i$ observed opens. Under the assumption of independence and identical distribution, the likelihood at each $\\gamma_i$ is binomial with parameter $P_o(\\gamma_i)$.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for each dataset in the test suite, fits the two-state Boltzmann model to estimate $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$ via maximum likelihood estimation. The parameters must be reported in International System of Units (SI): $\\Delta G_0$ in joules and $\\Delta A$ in square meters. Use the absolute temperature $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nYou must base your derivation and algorithm only on the following fundamental laws and core definitions:\n- The equilibrium open probability $P_o$ of a two-state system characterized by a free energy difference $\\Delta G$ is $P_o = \\dfrac{1}{1+\\exp\\left(\\dfrac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)}$.\n- The mechanical contribution to the free energy difference under tension is linear in $\\gamma$, $\\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\,\\Delta A$.\n- Binary opening events at fixed $\\gamma$ follow a binomial distribution with parameter $P_o(\\gamma)$.\n\nConstruct the maximum likelihood estimation carefully and derive the mapping from the parameters used in the optimizer to the physically interpretable $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$.\n\nTest suite. Fit the model to each of the following datasets, where each dataset consists of triplets $(\\gamma_i, n_i, x_i)$:\n- Dataset A:\n  - Tensions (in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$): $\\{0, 2\\times 10^{-4}, 5\\times 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 2\\times 10^{-3}, 4\\times 10^{-3}\\}$\n  - Trials and opens: $(200, 0)$, $(200, 1)$, $(200, 2)$, $(200, 9)$, $(200, 92)$, $(200, 199)$\n- Dataset B:\n  - Tensions (in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$): $\\{0, 10^{-3}, 2\\times 10^{-3}, 5\\times 10^{-3}\\}$\n  - Trials and opens: $(500, 24)$, $(500, 30)$, $(500, 37)$, $(500, 72)$\n- Dataset C:\n  - Tensions (in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$): $\\{0, 5\\times 10^{-4}, 10^{-3}, 1.5\\times 10^{-3}\\}$\n  - Trials and opens: $(150, 75)$, $(150, 138)$, $(150, 149)$, $(150, 149)$\n- Dataset D:\n  - Tensions (in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$): $\\{0, 2\\times 10^{-3}, 4\\times 10^{-3}\\}$\n  - Trials and opens: $(80, 1)$, $(80, 78)$, $(80, 79)$\n- Dataset E:\n  - Tensions (in $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$): $\\{0, 10^{-3}, 2\\times 10^{-3}\\}$\n  - Trials and opens: $(300, 36)$, $(300, 6)$, $(300, 1)$\n\nAnswer specification:\n- For each dataset, estimate $\\Delta G_0$ in $\\mathrm{J}$ and $\\Delta A$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n- Aggregate the results for all datasets into a single list in the order A, B, C, D, E, where each dataset contributes two numbers, first $\\Delta G_0$ then $\\Delta A$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, for example $[\\text{result}_1,\\text{result}_2,\\dots]$.\n\nEnsure scientific realism in your method and report all results in SI units as decimal floats. No angles are involved. Do not use percentage signs; if you need to represent ratios, use decimal fractions. Your algorithm must be general and derived from the stated base assumptions, without using any shortcut formulas not justified by the derivation.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical mechanics and biophysics, is well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution via maximum likelihood estimation. The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We may therefore proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe problem requires estimating the intrinsic free energy difference, $\\Delta G_0$, and the change in membrane area, $\\Delta A$, for a two-state mechanosensitive ion channel. The estimation is to be performed using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based on experimental data. The data consists of sets of observations $\\{(\\gamma_i, n_i, x_i)\\}$, where for each membrane tension $\\gamma_i$, $n_i$ independent channel state observations were made, resulting in $x_i$ 'open' states.\n\nThe theoretical foundation is the Boltzmann distribution for a two-state system in thermal equilibrium. The probability of the channel being in the open state, $P_o$, is determined by the free energy difference, $\\Delta G$, between the open and closed states, the absolute temperature, $T$, and the Boltzmann constant, $k_B$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\nP_o(\\Delta G) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe free energy difference $\\Delta G$ is dependent on the membrane tension $\\gamma$. The problem specifies a linear model for this dependence:\n$$\n\\Delta G(\\gamma) = \\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta G_0$ is the free energy difference at zero tension ($\\gamma=0$), and $\\Delta A$ is the change in the in-plane area of the membrane occupied by the channel protein as it transitions from the closed to the open state. A positive $\\Delta A$ signifies that opening the channel expands its area, making the open state more favorable at higher tensions (since work $\\gamma \\Delta A$ is done by the tension). Combining these two equations gives the open probability as a function of tension:\n$$\nP_o(\\gamma) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma \\Delta A}{k_B T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe experimental observations are assumed to be a series of independent Bernoulli trials at each fixed tension $\\gamma_i$. The number of 'open' events, $x_i$, out of $n_i$ trials thus follows a binomial distribution with success probability $p = P_o(\\gamma_i)$. The probability of observing exactly $x_i$ opens in $n_i$ trials is:\n$$\nP(X_i = x_i | \\gamma_i, n_i, \\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\binom{n_i}{x_i} [P_o(\\gamma_i)]^{x_i} [1 - P_o(\\gamma_i)]^{n_i - x_i}\n$$\nSince the experiments at different tensions $\\{\\gamma_i\\}$ are independent, the total likelihood $\\mathcal{L}$ of observing the entire dataset is the product of the probabilities for each tension:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\prod_{i} P(X_i = x_i | \\gamma_i, n_i, \\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\prod_{i} \\binom{n_i}{x_i} [P_o(\\gamma_i)]^{x_i} [1 - P_o(\\gamma_i)]^{n_i - x_i}\n$$\nFor both analytical and numerical convenience, it is standard practice to work with the natural logarithm of the likelihood function, the log-likelihood $LL$:\n$$\nLL(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\ln \\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{i} \\left[ \\ln\\binom{n_i}{x_i} + x_i \\ln(P_o(\\gamma_i)) + (n_i - x_i) \\ln(1 - P_o(\\gamma_i)) \\right]\n$$\nThe goal of maximum likelihood estimation is to find the parameter values $(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A)$ that maximize this function. The combinatorial term $\\ln\\binom{n_i}{x_i}$ does not depend on the parameters $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$, so it can be omitted from the optimization objective. We define the reduced log-likelihood function to be maximized as:\n$$\nLL'(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ x_i \\ln(P_o(\\gamma_i)) + (n_i - x_i) \\ln(1 - P_o(\\gamma_i)) \\right]\n$$\nLet's define the dimensionless energy argument $y_i = \\frac{\\Delta G(\\gamma_i)}{k_B T} = \\frac{\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma_i \\Delta A}{k_B T}$.\nWith this, $P_o(\\gamma_i) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{y_i}}$ and $1 - P_o(\\gamma_i) = \\frac{e^{y_i}}{1 + e^{y_i}}$.\nThe logarithmic terms become:\n$\\ln(P_o(\\gamma_i)) = -\\ln(1 + e^{y_i})$\n$\\ln(1 - P_o(\\gamma_i)) = y_i - \\ln(1 + e^{y_i})$\nSubstituting these into $LL'$:\n$$\nLL'(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ x_i (-\\ln(1 + e^{y_i})) + (n_i - x_i) (y_i - \\ln(1 + e^{y_i})) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nLL'(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ (n_i - x_i) y_i - n_i \\ln(1 + e^{y_i}) \\right]\n$$\nThis function cannot be maximized analytically. We must use numerical optimization methods. Standard optimization libraries typically find the minimum of a function, so we will minimize the negative log-likelihood, $NLL = -LL'$.\n$$\nNLL(\\Delta G_0, \\Delta A) = \\sum_{i} \\left[ n_i \\ln(1 + e^{y_i}) - (n_i - x_i) y_i \\right]\n$$\nwhere $y_i = (\\Delta G_0 - \\gamma_i \\Delta A) / (k_B T)$.\nFor numerical stability, the term $\\ln(1 + e^y)$ must be handled with care to avoid overflow when $y$ is large. This function, known as `softplus`, can be computed robustly. The implementation will use numerical optimization to find the values of $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$ that minimize this $NLL$ function for each dataset. The constants used will be $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $k_B = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, resulting in a thermal energy of $k_B T \\approx 4.11433 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}$. The parameters $\\Delta G_0$ and $\\Delta A$ will be determined in SI units of Joules and square meters, respectively.",
