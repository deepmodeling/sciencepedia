            "problem": "In cochlear mechanics, the Basilar Membrane (BM) is often modeled as a thin elastic structure supporting longitudinally varying traveling waves.

Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no identifiable flaws. It is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the mechanical impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{p}(x)}{\\hat{v}(x)}$. To do this, we will work with complex amplitudes for all time-harmonic quantities. All operators in the governing equation are linear, so we can replace the real-valued equation with its complex counterpart.\n\nLet the complex displacement be represented as:\n$$w_c(x,t) = \\hat{w}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$$\nwhere the complex amplitude is $\\hat{w}(x) = W(x)\\exp(-i\\int^x k(\\xi)d\\xi)$. The physical displacement is $w(x,t) = \\Re\\{w_c(x,t)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we find the complex amplitude of the transverse velocity, $\\hat{v}(x)$. The velocity is the time derivative of the displacement: $v(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t}$. The complex velocity is:\n$$v_c(x,t) = \\frac{\\partial w_c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left(\\hat{w}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)\\right) = i\\omega \\hat{w}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$$\nBy definition, $v_c(x,t) = \\hat{v}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$. Comparing these two expressions gives the complex velocity amplitude:\n$$\\hat{v}(x) = i\\omega \\hat{w}(x)$$\n\nNext, we express the complex pressure amplitude, $\\hat{p}(x)$, in terms of the complex displacement amplitude, $\\hat{w}(x)$, using the governing equation. Let the complex pressure be $p_c(x,t) = \\hat{p}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$. The complex form of the governing equation is:\n$$p_c(x,t) = D(x)\\frac{\\partial^{4} w_c}{\\partial x^{4}} + R(x)\\frac{\\partial w_c}{\\partial t} + m(x)\\frac{\\partial^{2} w_c}{\\partial t^{2}}$$\nWe evaluate each term on the right-hand side.\nThe time derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial w_c}{\\partial t} = i\\omega w_c(x,t)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{2} w_c}{\\partial t^{2}} = (i\\omega)^2 w_c(x,t) = -\\omega^2 w_c(x,t)$$\nThe spatial derivative is handled by the WKB approximation. As given, $\\frac{\\partial^{4} w}{\\partial x^{4}} \\approx k(x)^{4} w$. Since this approximation arises from the dominance of the rapidly varying phase term, which is present in both $w(x,t)$ and $w_c(x,t)$, it applies to the complex form as well:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^{4} w_c}{\\partial x^{4}} \\approx k(x)^{4} w_c(x,t)$$\nSubstituting these into the complex governing equation:\n$$\\hat{p}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t) = D(x)\\left(k(x)^{4} w_c\\right) + R(x)\\left(i\\omega w_c\\right) + m(x)\\left(-\\omega^2 w_c\\right)$$\nSubstitute $w_c(x,t) = \\hat{w}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$:\n$$\\hat{p}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t) = \\left[D(x)k(x)^{4} + i\\omega R(x) - \\omega^2 m(x)\\right]\\hat{w}(x)\\exp(i\\omega t)$$\nDividing both sides by $\\exp(i\\omega t)$ yields the relationship between the complex amplitudes:\n$$\\hat{p}(x) = \\left[D(x)k(x)^{4} - m(x)\\omega^2 + i\\omega R(x)\\right]\\hat{w}(x)$$\nNow, we use the definition of the effective stiffness, $K(x) = D(x)k(x)^{4}$:\n$$\\hat{p}(x) = \\left[K(x) - m(x)\\omega^2 + i\\omega R(x)\\right]\\hat{w}(x)$$\nWe now have expressions for both $\\hat{p}(x)$ and $\\hat{v}(x)$ in terms of $\\hat{w}(x)$. We can compute the impedance $Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega)$ by taking their ratio:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{p}(x)}{\\hat{v}(x)} = \\frac{\\left[K(x) - m(x)\\omega^2 + i\\omega R(x)\\right]\\hat{w}(x)}{i\\omega \\hat{w}(x)}$$\nThe complex displacement amplitude $\\hat{w}(x)$ cancels out:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = \\frac{K(x) - m(x)\\omega^2 + i\\omega R(x)}{i\\omega}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we separate the terms:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = \\frac{i\\omega R(x)}{i\\omega} + \\frac{K(x) - m(x)\\omega^2}{i\\omega}$$\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = R(x) + \\frac{1}{i}\\left(\\frac{K(x)}{\\omega} - m(x)\\omega\\right)$$\nUsing the identity $\\frac{1}{i} = -i$:\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = R(x) - i\\left(\\frac{K(x)}{\\omega} - m(x)\\omega\\right)$$\nFinally, rearranging the terms inside the parentheses to present the impedance in the standard form (Real Part + $i \\times$ Imaginary Part):\n$$Z_{\\mathrm{BM}}(x,\\omega) = R(x) + i\\left(m(x)\\omega - \\frac{K(x)}{\\omega}\\right)$$\nThis expression represents the mechanical impedance of the Basilar Membrane model, with a resistive part $R(x)$ and a reactive part composed of a mass-like term $m(x)\\omega$ and a stiffness-like term $-K(x)/\\omega$. The expression is in terms of the required variables $K(x)$, $m(x)$, $R(x)$, and $\\omega$.",

We are given that the flow of the incompressible Newtonian fluid (perilymph) is laminar and driven by a pressure difference, $\\Delta p$, between the scala vestibuli (SV) and scala tympani (ST). At the low frequencies of interest, we can use the steady Stokes limit of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nWe assume the slit is wide compared to its height ($w \\gg h$), allowing us to model the flow as a pressure-driven shear flow (plane Poiseuille flow) between two infinite parallel plates separated by a distance $h$. Let the $x$-axis be along the length $L$ of the slit and the $y$-axis be perpendicular to the plates, with $y=0$ at the center of the channel. The plates are located at $y = \\pm h/2$. For a steady, fully developed flow, the velocity $u$ is only in the $x$-direction and is a function of $y$ only, i.e., $u(y)$.\n\nThe Stokes equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\mu \\frac{d^2u}{dy^2} = \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $\\frac{dp}{dx}$ is the pressure gradient driving the flow. For a constant pressure gradient along the slit length $L$, we have $\\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\frac{\\Delta p}{L}$, where $\\Delta p$ is the pressure drop from the entrance to the exit of the slit.\n\nIntegrating the equation with respect to $y$ twice:\n$$ \\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y + C_1 $$\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) y^2 + C_1 y + C_2 $$\nThe boundary conditions are the no-slip conditions at the walls: $u(y = h/2) = 0$ and $u(y = -h/2) = 0$.\nApplying the first boundary condition:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_1 \\frac{h}{2} + C_2 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 - C_1 \\frac{h}{2} + C_2 $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first yields $C_1 h = 0$, so $C_1 = 0$. This is also expected from the symmetry of the velocity profile.\nSubstituting $C_1 = 0$ back into one of the boundary condition equations gives:\n$$ C_2 = -\\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\left(\\frac{dp}{dx}\\right) \\frac{h^2}{4} = -\\frac{h^2}{8\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} $$\nThe velocity profile is therefore:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{1}{2\\mu} \\frac{dp}{dx} \\left(y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) = \\frac{-\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left(y^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) $$\nTo find the volumetric flow rate $U$, we integrate the velocity profile over the cross-sectional area of the slit, $A = w \\times h$:\n$$ U = \\int_{A} u(y) \\,dA = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} u(y) w \\,dy = w \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\frac{\\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left(\\frac{h^2}{4} - y^2\\right) dy $$\n$$ U = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left[ \\frac{h^2}{4}y - \\frac{y^3}{3} \\right]_{-h/2}^{h/2} = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( 2 \\left( \\frac{h^3}{8} - \\frac{h^3}{24} \\right) \\right) = \\frac{w \\Delta p}{2\\mu L} \\left( 2 \\frac{2h^3}{24} \\right) = \\frac{w h^3 \\Delta p}{12 \\mu L} $$\nAcoustic resistance, $R_a$, is defined as the ratio of the pressure difference to the volumetric flow rate, $R_a = \\Delta p / U$. For the helicotrema, this resistance, $R_h$, is:\n$$ R_h = \\frac{\\Delta p}{U} = \\frac{12 \\mu L}{w h^3} $$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Cutoff Frequency ($f_c$)**\n\nThe problem describes a low-frequency AC acoustic circuit. The differential pressure $\\Delta p$ across the cochlear partition drives two parallel pathways: one through the partition itself and one through the helicotrema shunt.\nThe impedance of the cochlear partition is modeled as a pure compliance, $C_p$. In acoustic terms, this is analogous to a capacitor, and its impedance $Z_p$ is given by:\n$$ Z_p = \\frac{1}{j \\omega C_p} $$\nwhere $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency and $j$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe impedance of the helicotrema shunt, $Z_h$, is primarily resistive at low frequencies, as derived above. A more complete model would include an inertive (mass) term, $L_h = \\rho L / (wh)$, making $Z_h = R_h + j\\omega L_h$. However, the problem specifies a derivation from the steady Stokes limit, implying a focus on the resistive component, which dominates at low frequencies. We therefore approximate $Z_h \\approx R_h$.\n\nThe cutoff frequency, $f_c$, is defined as the frequency at which the magnitudes of these two impedances are equal. Below $f_c$, the compliant impedance of the partition ($|Z_p| = 1/(\\omega C_p)$) is large compared to the shunt resistance $R_h$, so most of the volume velocity is shunted through the helicotrema. Above $f_c$, the partition impedance is smaller, and it is driven more effectively.\nThe criterion is $|Z_h| = |Z_p|$. At the cutoff frequency $\\omega_c = 2\\pi f_c$:\n$$ |R_h| = \\left| \\frac{1}{j \\omega_c C_p} \\right| $$\n$$ R_h = \\frac{1}{\\omega_c C_p} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_c C_p} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $R_h$:\n$$ \\frac{12 \\mu L}{w h^3} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_c C_p} $$\nSolving for the cutoff frequency $f_c$:\n$$ f_c = \\frac{w h^3}{2\\pi C_p (12 \\mu L)} = \\frac{w h^3}{24 \\pi \\mu L C_p} $$\n\n**Part 3: Justification and Numerical Evaluation**\n\nBefore evaluating $f_c$, we justify the key assumptions. The density of perilymph is approximately that of water, $\\rho \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{kg/m^3}$.\n1.  **Laminar Flow**: We check the Reynolds number, $Re = \\rho \\bar{V} D_h / \\mu$, where $\\bar{V}$ is the average fluid velocity and $D_h$ is the hydraulic diameter. For a rectangular channel with $w=6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $h=2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the hydraulic diameter is $D_h = 2wh/(w+h) = 2(6 \\times 10^{-4})(2 \\times 10^{-4})/(8 \\times 10^{-4}) = 3 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. At the low frequencies considered, fluid velocities are very small (on the order of $\\mu\\mathrm{m/s}$ to $\\mathrm{mm/s}$), leading to a Reynolds number $Re \\ll 1$. Thus, the flow is deep within the laminar regime.\n2.  **Quasi-Steady Flow**: The steady-state Poiseuille profile is valid when the frequency is low enough that the viscous boundary layer has time to develop fully across the channel within one oscillation period. This is true when the Womersley number $\\alpha = (h/2)\\sqrt{\\omega \\rho / \\mu}$ is small ($\\alpha \\ll 1$). We will verify this condition after calculating $f_c$.\n\nNow, we evaluate $f_c$ using the given parameters:\n- $\\mu = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{Pa \\cdot s}$\n- $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $w = 6.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $h = 2.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $C_{p} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\mathrm{m^{3}/Pa}$\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for $f_c$:\n$$ f_c = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-4}) (2.0 \\times 10^{-4})^3}{24 \\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (5.0 \\times 10^{-12})} $$\n$$ f_c = \\frac{(6.0 \\times 10^{-4}) (8.0 \\times 10^{-12})}{24 \\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (7.5 \\times 10^{-15})} $$\n$$ f_c = \\frac{48.0 \\times 10^{-16}}{180 \\pi \\times 10^{-18}} = \\frac{48.0 \\times 10^2}{180 \\pi} = \\frac{4800}{180 \\pi} = \\frac{80}{3\\pi} $$\n$$ f_c \\approx \\frac{80}{3 \\times 3.14159} \\approx 8.4885 \\, \\mathrm{Hz} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $f_c = 8.49 \\, \\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nAt this frequency, the Womersley number is $\\alpha = (1.0 \\times 10^{-4})\\sqrt{2\\pi(8.49)(1000)/(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})} \\approx 0.73$. Since $\\alpha$ is not much smaller than $1$, the quasi-steady assumption is only marginally valid, and fluid inertance is beginning to be significant. However, the calculation is consistent with the problem's directive to use the steady Stokes limit, yielding the cutoff frequency under this specific low-frequency model.",

Higher $G$ reduces effective damping (i.e., implements negative damping), but $G$ must remain strictly less than $1$ for stability.\n- Use longitudinal coupling $c = 1.0\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$.\n- The driving force is applied at the base ($i=0$) with $F_0 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{N}$, and $F_i=0$ for $i>0$.\n\nFor each test case, compute the steady-state complex displacement vector $\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ by solving the resulting tridiagonal linear system. From $\\mathbf{U}$, define the following observable outputs:\n\n1. The peak amplitude along the partition:\n$$\nA_{\\max} = \\max_{i} |U_i|, \\quad \\text{with units in } \\mathrm{m}.\n$$\n\n2.

For an observable $O \\in \\{A_{\\max}, x_{\\max}, S_\\phi\\}$ and parameter $p \\in \\{s_K, s_R, G\\}$, estimate the dimensionless log-sensitivity:\n$$\nS_{p}(O) \\approx \\frac{O\\left(p(1+\\varepsilon)\\right) - O\\left(p(1-\\varepsilon)\\right)}{2\\,\\varepsilon\\,O(p)},\n$$\nwhere $O(p)$ denotes the baseline observable evaluated at the unperturbed parameter $p$. If $O(p)=0$, define $S_{p}(O)=0$ to avoid division by zero. Use $\\varepsilon = 0.05$.\n\nScientific realism requirements:\n\n- All quantities must be treated with consistent physical units. In particular, $A_{\\max}$ must be computed and internally represented in $\\mathrm{m}$, $x_{\\max}$ in $\\mathrm{m}$, and $S_\\phi$ in $\\mathrm{rad/m}$. The final reported sensitivity indices $S_{p}(O)$ are dimensionless (unitless).\n- Angles must be computed in radians.\n\nTest suite:\n\nEvaluate the sensitivity indices for the following three test cases, which probe different aspects of the system:\n\n- Case $1$: Frequency $f=2000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, baseline stiffness scaling $s_K=1.0$, baseline damping scaling $s_R=1.0$, OHC gain $G=0.3$.\n- Case $2$: Frequency $f=1000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, baseline stiffness scaling $s_K=1.0$, increased damping scaling $s_R=1.2$, OHC gain $G=0.0$ (passive cochlea).\n- Case $3$: Frequency $f=4000\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, reduced stiffness scaling $s_K=0.8$, baseline damping scaling $s_R=1.0$, high OHC gain $G=0.9$ (near-active edge, but stable since $G<1$).\n\nYour program must:\n\n- Construct and solve the linear system for each test case.\n- Compute $A_{\\max}$, $x_{\\max}$, and $S_\\phi$ at baseline and at the $\\pm \\varepsilon$ perturbations for each of the three parameters $s_K$, $s_R$, and $G$.\n- Return the nine sensitivity indices for each case in the fixed order:\n$$\n\\left[S_{s_K}(A_{\\max}),\\,S_{s_R}(A_{\\max}),\\,S_{G}(A_{\\max}),\\,S_{s_K}(x_{\\max}),\\,S_{s_R}(x_{\\max}),\\,S_{G}(x_{\\max}),\\,S_{s_K}(S_\\phi),\\,S_{s_R}(S_\\phi),\\,S_{G}(S_\\phi)\\right].\n$$\n\nFinal output format:\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all three cases as a comma-separated list of lists, enclosed in square brackets. For example:\n$[\\,[\\text{case1\\_s1},\\dots,\\text{case1\\_s9}],\\,[\\text{case2\\_s1},\\dots,\\text{case2\\_s9}],\\,[\\text{case3\\_s1},\\dots,\\text{case3\\_s9}]\\,]$.\nAll printed values must be plain numbers (booleans, integers, floats, or lists of these) without units or additional text.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The solution requires a numerical implementation following these steps:\n\n1.  **Discretize the Model:** The basilar membrane is modeled as a 1D chain of $N=200$ segments along its length $L=0.035\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The spatial coordinate for segment $i$ is $x_i = i \\cdot L/(N-1)$. All parameters ($k_i, r_i, m_i$) are evaluated at these discrete points. The angular frequency is $\\omega=2\\pi f$.\n\n2.  **Formulate the Linear System:** The frequency-domain equation of motion for each segment is arranged to form a linear system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{U} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ is the vector of complex displacements. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ is tridiagonal.\n    *   For an interior segment $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, N-2\\}$, the equation is:\n        $$-c U_{i-1} + \\left(k_i - m_0 \\omega^2 + 2c + \\mathrm{i}\\omega r_{\\mathrm{eff},i}\\right)U_i - c U_{i+1} = 0$$\n    *   For the base ($i=0$), the equation is modified for one-sided coupling:\n        $$\\left(k_0 - m_0 \\omega^2 + c + \\mathrm{i}\\omega r_{\\mathrm{eff},0}\\right)U_0 - c U_1 = F_0$$\n    *   For the apex ($i=N-1$), the equation is:\n        $$-c U_{N-2} + \\left(k_{N-1} - m_0 \\omega^2 + c + \\mathrm{i}\\omega r_{\\mathrm{eff},N-1}\\right)U_{N-1} = 0$$\n    The force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ is $[F_0, 0, \\dots, 0]^T$.\n\n3.  **Solve for Displacements:** The complex tridiagonal system $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{U}=\\mathbf{F}$ is solved numerically using a standard linear algebra solver (e.g., a banded matrix solver) to find the displacement vector $\\mathbf{U}$.\n\n4.  **Compute Observables:** From the solution vector $\\mathbf{U}$:\n    *   $A_{\\max}$ is found by taking the maximum of the absolute values of the elements of $\\mathbf{U}$.\n    *   $x_{\\max}$ is the spatial coordinate $x_i$ corresponding to the index $i^*$ where the maximum amplitude occurs.\n    *   $S_\\phi$ is calculated by first unwrapping the phase $\\phi_i = \\arg(U_i)$ to get a continuous profile, then using a finite difference approximation for the spatial derivative $\\partial\\phi/\\partial x$ at the peak location $x_{i^*}$. A central difference is used for interior points, and one-sided differences for boundary points.\n\n5.  **Calculate Sensitivities:** For each parameter $p \\in \\{s_K, s_R, G\\}$ and observable $O \\in \\{A_{\\max}, x_{\\max}, S_\\phi\\}$, the dimensionless log-sensitivity is computed using a symmetric finite difference:\n    $$ S_{p}(O) \\approx \\frac{O\\left(p(1+\\varepsilon)\\right) - O\\left(p(1-\\varepsilon)\\right)}{2\\,\\varepsilon\\,O(p)} $$\n    where $\\varepsilon=0.05$. This involves re-solving the system and re-computing the observables for perturbed parameter values $p(1+\\varepsilon)$ and $p(1-\\varepsilon)$ while keeping other parameters at their baseline values. If a baseline observable $O(p)$ is zero, the sensitivity is defined as zero.\n\nThis entire procedure is performed for each of the three test cases specified in the problem statement.",
