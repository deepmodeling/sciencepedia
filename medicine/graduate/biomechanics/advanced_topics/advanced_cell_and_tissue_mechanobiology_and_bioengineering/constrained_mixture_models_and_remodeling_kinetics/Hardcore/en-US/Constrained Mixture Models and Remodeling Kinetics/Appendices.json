Therefore, the elastic principal stretches of constituent $i$, which we denote as $\\lambda_{e,i}^{(a)}$ for $a=1,2,3$, are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(1)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(2)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(3)} = \\frac{\\lambda_3}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(3)}}\n$$\nThese results are consistent with Part A, which is a special case of this general formulation.\n\nThe final answer requires a single row matrix containing the result from Part A followed by the three results from Part B.",

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core principle is the conservation of mass for the constituent `$i$`, which states that the rate of change of its mass fraction, `$\\dot{m}_i(t) = \\frac{dm_i}{dt}$`, is the difference between the production rate, `$P$`, and the removal rate, `$R$`.\n$$ \\frac{dm_i}{dt} = P - R $$\n\nThe removal kinetics are first-order, meaning the removal rate is directly proportional to the current mass fraction `$m_i(t)$`. The constant of proportionality is the removal rate constant `$k_i>0$`.\n$$ R(t) = k_i m_i(t) $$\n\nFor time `$t \\ge 0$`, a step change in stimulus has occurred, and the problem states that the production rate `$P$` is constant and equal to the removal rate that would prevail at the new steady-state mass fraction, `$m_i^{\\infty,\\mathrm{new}}$`. At this new steady state, production would balance removal, so the removal rate would be `$k_i m_i^{\\infty,\\mathrm{new}}$`. Therefore, for `$t \\ge 0$`, the production rate is:\n$$ P = k_i m_i^{\\infty,\\mathrm{new}} $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for `$P$` and `$R(t)$` into the mass conservation equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for `$m_i(t)$` for `$t \\ge 0$`.\n\n1) Derivation and solution of the Initial Value Problem (IVP)\n\nThe governing ODE is:\n$$ \\frac{dm_i}{dt} = k_i m_i^{\\infty,\\mathrm{new}} - k_i m_i(t) $$\nThis is a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE.

We will use the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_{i}}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = \\frac{\\partial T_{i}}{\\partial \\eta_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $\\eta_i$ with respect to $\\lambda_{d,i}$:\n$$\n\\eta_{i} = \\lambda \\lambda_{d,i}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = -\\lambda \\lambda_{d,i}^{-2} = -\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{2}}\n$$\nNoting that $\\eta_i = \\lambda/\\lambda_{d,i}$, this can also be expressed as $\\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = -\\frac{\\eta_i}{\\lambda_{d,i}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the derivative of $T_i$ with respect to $\\eta_i$. To simplify the process, let's define an auxiliary variable $U_i = \\eta_i^2 - 1$. The expression for $T_i$ becomes:\n$$\nT_i = w_i \\, 2 k_1 U_i \\exp(k_2 U_i^2)\n$$\nWe can now apply the chain rule again: $\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = \\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial \\eta_i}$.\nThe derivative of $U_i$ with respect to $\\eta_i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta_i} (\\eta_i^2 - 1) = 2 \\eta_i\n$$\nThe derivative of $T_i$ with respect to $U_i$ is found using the product rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} = \\frac{d}{d U_i} \\left[ w_i 2 k_1 U_i \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} = w_i 2 k_1 \\left[ \\frac{d}{d U_i}(U_i) \\cdot \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) + U_i \\cdot \\frac{d}{d U_i}(\\exp(k_2 U_i^2)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} = w_i 2 k_1 \\left[ 1 \\cdot \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) + U_i \\cdot \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) \\cdot (2 k_2 U_i) \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out the exponential term:\n$$\n\\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} = w_i 2 k_1 \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) \\left[ 1 + 2 k_2 U_i^2 \\right]\n$$\nNow, we assemble $\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial \\eta_i}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = \\frac{d T_i}{d U_i} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = \\left( w_i 2 k_1 \\exp(k_2 U_i^2) [1 + 2 k_2 U_i^2] \\right) \\cdot (2 \\eta_i)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = 4 w_i k_1 \\eta_i [1 + 2 k_2 U_i^2] \\exp(k_2 U_i^2)\n$$\nSubstituting back $U_i = \\eta_i^2 - 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T_i}{\\partial \\eta_i} = 4 w_i k_1 \\eta_i \\left[1 + 2 k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right] \\exp\\left(k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we can compute the desired sensitivity by combining the parts:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = \\frac{\\partial T_{i}}{\\partial \\eta_{i}} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_{i}}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = \\left( 4 w_i k_1 \\eta_i \\left[1 + 2 k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right] \\exp\\left(k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right) \\right) \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{\\eta_i}{\\lambda_{d,i}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = - \\frac{4 w_i k_1 \\eta_i^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}} \\left[1 + 2 k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right] \\exp\\left(k_2 (\\eta_i^2 - 1)^2\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in terms of $\\lambda$, $\\lambda_{d,i}$, $w_i$, $k_1$, and $k_2$. We must substitute $\\eta_i = \\lambda / \\lambda_{d,i}$ and $\\eta_i^2 = \\lambda^2 / \\lambda_{d,i}^2$ into the expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = - \\frac{4 w_i k_1 (\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^2})}{\\lambda_{d,i}} \\left[1 + 2 k_2 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^2} - 1\\right)^2\\right] \\exp\\left(k_2 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^2} - 1\\right)^2\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the pre-factor gives the final analytical expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial \\lambda_{d,i}} = - \\frac{4 w_i k_1 \\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^3} \\left[1 + 2 k_2 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^2} - 1\\right)^2\\right] \\exp\\left(k_2 \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^2} - 1\\right)^2\\right)\n$$",
