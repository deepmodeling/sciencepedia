This is expressed as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F} = \\mathbf{F}_{e,i} \\mathbf{F}_{d,i}\n$$\nFrom this relationship, the elastic distortion tensor for constituent $i$, $\\mathbf{F}_{e,i}$, can be isolated by right-multiplying by the inverse of the deposition distortion tensor, $\\mathbf{F}_{d,i}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{e,i} = \\mathbf{F} (\\mathbf{F}_{d,i})^{-1}\n$$\nThis equation forms the basis for solving both parts of the problem.\n\n### Part A: Uniaxial Loading\n\nIn this part, we consider a uniaxial extension along the direction of an orthonormal basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$. The total stretch in this direction is given as $\\lambda$. The fiber family $i$ is aligned with $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$. The problem states that both the total deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F}$, and the deposition tensor for family $i$, $\\mathbf{F}_{d,i}$, are diagonal in the basis $\\{\\mathbf{e}_{1}, \\mathbf{e}_{2}, \\mathbf{e}_{3}\\}$.\n\nThe matrix representation of the total deformation gradient, $\\mathbf{F}$, in this basis has the total stretch $\\lambda$ as its first diagonal component.

First, we find the inverse of $\\mathbf{F}_{d,i}$:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{F}_{d,i})^{-1} \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(1)}}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(2)}}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(3)}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the matrix for the elastic distortion $\\mathbf{F}_{e,i}$ in this principal basis:\n$$\n\\mathbf{F}_{e,i} \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\lambda_2  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\lambda_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(1)}}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(2)}}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(3)}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(1)}}  0  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(2)}}  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\frac{\\lambda_3}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(3)}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{F}_{e,i}$ is diagonal in the principal basis of $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\mathbf{F}_{d,i}$, its diagonal entries are its principal stretches. Therefore, the elastic principal stretches of constituent $i$, which we denote as $\\lambda_{e,i}^{(a)}$ for $a=1,2,3$, are:\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\lambda_1}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(1)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(2)}}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,i}^{(3)} = \\frac{\\lambda_3}{\\lambda_{d,i}^{(3)}}\n$$\nThese results are consistent with Part A, which is a special case of this general formulation.\n\nThe final answer requires a single row matrix containing the result from Part A followed by the three results from Part B.",

Therefore, the total Cauchy stress $\\sigma$ can be written as:\n$$ \\sigma(\\lambda) = \\phi_{m} \\sigma_{m}(\\lambda) + \\phi_{f} \\sigma_{f}(\\lambda) $$\nwhere $\\sigma_{m}$ and $\\sigma_{f}$ are the Cauchy stresses corresponding to the matrix and fiber constituents, respectively.\n\nThe contribution from the ground matrix is given directly:\n$$ \\sigma_{m, \\text{contrib}} = \\phi_{m} \\mu\\left(\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda^{-1}\\right) $$\n\nFor the fiber contribution, we first find the stress $\\sigma_{f}(\\lambda)$ from the total fiber strain-energy density $\\psi_{f, \\text{total}}(\\lambda)$.\n$$ \\psi_{f, \\text{total}}(\\lambda) = \\int_{1}^{\\Lambda_{r}}\\psi_{f}(\\lambda;\\Lambda_{s})\\,p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} $$\nGiven $\\psi_{f}(\\lambda;\\Lambda_{s})=\\frac{k_{f}}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}-1\\right)^{2} H\\!\\left(\\lambda-\\Lambda_{s}\\right)$, and that we are evaluating at a stretch $\\lambda$ such that $1  \\lambda  \\Lambda_{r}$, the Heaviside function $H(\\lambda - \\Lambda_{s})$ restricts the integration to the domain where $\\Lambda_{s} \\le \\lambda$.\n$$ \\psi_{f, \\text{total}}(\\lambda) = \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\frac{k_{f}}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}-1\\right)^{2} p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} $$\nThe nominal stress from the fibers is $P_{f}(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\psi_{f, \\text{total}}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}$. Using the Leibniz integral rule, where the integrand is zero at the upper integration limit $\\Lambda_{s}=\\lambda$, we get:\n$$ P_{f}(\\lambda) = \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda} \\left[ \\frac{k_{f}}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}-1\\right)^{2} \\right] p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} = k_{f} \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}-1\\right)\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{s}} p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} $$\nThe Cauchy stress from the fibers is $\\sigma_{f}(\\lambda) = \\lambda P_{f}(\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{f}(\\lambda) = k_{f} \\lambda \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}^{2}}-\\frac{1}{\\Lambda_{s}}\\right) p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} = k_{f} \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\Lambda_{s}^{2}}-\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}\\right) p(\\Lambda_{s})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} $$\nNow we substitute the given probability density function, $p(\\Lambda_{s})=\\frac{\\alpha}{\\Lambda_{r}^{\\alpha}-1}\\Lambda_{s}^{\\alpha-1}$ with $\\alpha=3$:\n$$ p(\\Lambda_{s}) = \\frac{3}{\\Lambda_{r}^{3}-1}\\Lambda_{s}^{2} $$\nLet $C = \\frac{3}{\\Lambda_{r}^{3}-1}$. The fiber stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{f}(\\lambda) = k_{f} \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^2}{\\Lambda_{s}^{2}}-\\frac{\\lambda}{\\Lambda_{s}}\\right) C \\Lambda_{s}^{2} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} = C k_{f} \\int_{1}^{\\lambda} (\\lambda^2 - \\lambda \\Lambda_{s}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\Lambda_{s} $$\nEvaluating this integral gives a closed-form expression for $\\sigma_{f}(\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\sigma_{f}(\\lambda) = C k_{f} \\left[\\lambda^2 \\Lambda_{s} - \\lambda \\frac{\\Lambda_{s}^2}{2}\\right]_{1}^{\\lambda} = C k_{f} \\left[ (\\lambda^3 - \\frac{\\lambda^3}{2}) - (\\lambda^2 - \\frac{\\lambda}{2}) \\right] = C k_{f} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^3}{2} - \\lambda^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right) $$\nThe total stress is then:\n$$ \\sigma(\\lambda) = \\phi_{m} \\mu\\left(\\lambda^{2}-\\lambda^{-1}\\right) + \\phi_{f} C k_{f} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda^3}{2} - \\lambda^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{2}\\right) $$\nTo find the tangent stiffness $K_{t}$, we differentiate $\\sigma(\\lambda)$ with respect to $\\lambda$:\n$$ K_{t}(\\lambda) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\sigma}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\phi_{m} \\mu(2\\lambda + \\lambda^{-2}) + \\phi_{f} C k_{f} \\left(\\frac{3\\lambda^2}{2} - 2\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values:\n$\\mu = 30$ kPa, $k_{f}=800$ kPa, $\\phi_{m}=0.6$, $\\phi_{f}=0.4$, $\\Lambda_{r}=1.6$, $\\alpha=3$, and $\\lambda=1.2$.\n\nFirst, calculate the constant $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{3}{1.6^3 - 1} = \\frac{3}{4.096 - 1} = \\frac{3}{3.096} $$\nThe matrix contribution to stiffness is:\n$$ K_{t,m} = \\phi_{m} \\mu(2\\lambda + \\lambda^{-2}) = 0.6 \\times 30 \\times (2(1.2) + 1.2^{-2}) = 18 \\times (2.4 + \\frac{1}{1.44}) = 18 \\times (2.4 + 0.69444...) = 18 \\times 3.09444... = 55.7 $$\nThe fiber contribution to stiffness is:\n$$ K_{t,f} = \\phi_{f} C k_{f} \\left(\\frac{3\\lambda^2}{2} - 2\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\right) $$\nThe term in the parenthesis is:\n$$ \\frac{3(1.2)^2}{2} - 2(1.2) + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3(1.44)}{2} - 2.4 + 0.5 = 2.16 - 2.4 + 0.5 = 0.26 $$\nThe pre-factor is:\n$$ \\phi_{f} C k_{f} = 0.4 \\times \\frac{3}{3.096} \\times 800 = \\frac{960}{3.096} \\approx 310.0775 $$\nSo, the fiber stiffness contribution is:\n$$ K_{t,f} \\approx 310.0775 \\times 0.26 \\approx 80.62015 $$\nThe total tangent stiffness is the sum of the two contributions:\n$$ K_{t} = K_{t,m} + K_{t,f} \\approx 55.7 + 80.62015 = 136.32015 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $K_{t} = 136.3$ kPa.\n\nThe progressive recruitment of fibers sharpens the nonlinearity of the stress-stretch response. Our derived expression for the tangent stiffness, $K_{t}(\\lambda)$, makes this clear. The fiber contribution to stiffness, $K_{t,f} = \\phi_{f} C k_{f} \\left(\\frac{3\\lambda^2}{2} - 2\\lambda + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, is a quadratic function of stretch $\\lambda$. For $\\lambda1$, this term is positive and grows with increasing $\\lambda$. This growth in stiffness arises from the combination of two effects: the intrinsic stiffening of already-recruited fibers and, crucially, the continuous recruitment of new, initially slack fibers as the stretch $\\lambda$ increases. The integration limit being $\\lambda$ in the original formulation captures this recruitment process. The resulting closed-form stiffness term shows a dependence on $\\lambda^2$, which represents a rapid increase in stiffness (a sharp nonlinearity) compared to the more modest stiffening of the matrix component.",
