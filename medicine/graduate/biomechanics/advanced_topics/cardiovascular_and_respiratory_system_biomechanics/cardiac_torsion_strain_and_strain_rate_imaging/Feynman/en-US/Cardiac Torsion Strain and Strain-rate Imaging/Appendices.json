            "introduction": "To truly understand cardiac torsion, we must begin with its origin in the heart's unique micro-architecture. This foundational exercise explores how the helical arrangement of myocardial fibers generates the macroscopic twisting motion observed during contraction. By applying first principles of continuum mechanics to an idealized model of the ventricular wall, you will uncover the direct link between fiber orientation and the characteristic wringing motion of the heart, providing insight into why torsion is a sensitive indicator of myocardial function .",

            "problem": "Consider an idealized, axisymmetric short-axis slice of the left ventricular (LV) myocardium modeled as a thick cylindrical ring with inner radius $r_{\\mathrm{endo}}$ and outer radius $r_{\\mathrm{epi}}$, composed of an incompressible, transversely isotropic material whose axis of anisotropy is the cardiac fiber direction. Let the local orthonormal basis be $\\{\\mathbf{e}_{r}, \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}, \\mathbf{e}_{z}\\}$, where $\\mathbf{e}_{z}$ is the longitudinal axis directed from base toward apex. The cardiac fiber direction at radius $r$ is given by the unit vector $\\mathbf{f}(r) = \\cos\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}$, where the transmural fiber helix angle $\\psi(r)$ is measured relative to the circumferential direction $\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$ and varies linearly from $\\psi(r_{\\mathrm{endo}}) = +60^{\\circ}$ at the endocardium to $\\psi(r_{\\mathrm{epi}}) = -60^{\\circ}$ at the epicardium. Assume uniform, synchronous activation producing a constant active fiber tension $T_{a} > 0$ across the wall and neglect passive anisotropy for the purpose of determining the torsional sign. The Cauchy stress is taken as the sum of a Lagrange multiplier enforcing incompressibility and an active stress aligned with $\\mathbf{f}$, that is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}(r) = -p(r)\\,\\mathbf{I} + T_{a}\\,\\mathbf{f}(r)\\otimes\\mathbf{f}(r)$.\n\nDefine the observed rotation sign convention as follows: a positive rotation is counterclockwise when the LV is viewed from the apex looking toward the base; a negative rotation is clockwise under the same viewing condition. Using first principles of continuum mechanics, balance of angular momentum, and the above constitutive assumption, determine the expected sign of the apical rotation and the basal rotation during isovolumic contraction/early systole under the stated uniform activation. Your derivation must begin from the definition of the fiber-aligned active stress and must explicitly link the sign of the torsional moment per unit length to the observed rotation sign under the specified viewing convention.\n\nExpress your final answer as a two-entry row matrix using $+1$ to denote a positive (counterclockwise) rotation and $-1$ to denote a negative (clockwise) rotation, in the order: apical rotation sign, basal rotation sign. Angle magnitudes are not required; only the signs are to be reported. Angle units in the setup are degrees for $\\psi(r)$; the observed rotation sign definition is unitless by construction. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The objective is to determine the sign of apical and basal rotation based on the torsional moment generated by active fiber contraction. This moment is derived from the active stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_a = T_{a}\\,\\mathbf{f}(r)\\otimes\\mathbf{f}(r)$.\n\n1.  **Determine the Shear Stress Component:** The twisting motion (torsion) about the longitudinal $z$-axis is driven by the circumferential-longitudinal shear stress, $\\sigma_{z\\theta}$ (or $\\sigma_{\\theta z}$). We find this component from the dyadic product of the fiber vector $\\mathbf{f}(r) = \\cos\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}$:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_a = T_a (\\cos\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}) \\otimes (\\cos\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z})\n    $$\n    The term corresponding to the $\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$ component is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) = T_{a}\\,\\cos\\psi(r)\\sin\\psi(r) = \\frac{T_{a}}{2}\\sin(2\\psi(r))\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the Net Torsional Moment:** The net torsional moment, $M_z$, across a transverse cross-section is the integral of the moment contributions from the shear stress over the area of the ring. An infinitesimal area element $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ subject to shear stress $\\sigma_{z\\theta}$ generates a moment $dM_z = (\\sigma_{z\\theta}\\,dA) \\times r$.\n    $$\n    M_z = \\int_{A} r \\, \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n    $$\n    Due to axisymmetry, the integral simplifies to:\n    $$\n    M_z = 2\\pi \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\left( \\frac{T_{a}}{2}\\sin(2\\psi(r)) \\right) \\, dr = \\pi T_a \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\sin(2\\psi(r)) \\, dr\n    $$\n\n3.  **Analyze the Sign of the Integral:** The sign of $M_z$ depends on the integral, as $\\pi T_a > 0$. The helix angle $\\psi(r)$ varies from $+60^{\\circ}$ (endocardium) to $-60^{\\circ}$ (epicardium).\n    *   **Sub-endocardium:** $\\psi(r)$ is positive, so $\\sin(2\\psi(r))$ is positive. This contributes a positive value to the integral.\n    *   **Sub-epicardium:** $\\psi(r)$ is negative, so $\\sin(2\\psi(r))$ is negative. This contributes a negative value to the integral.\n    The crucial factor is the $r^2$ weighting term in the integrand. Since the radius $r$ is larger in the outer wall (epicardium) than in the inner wall (endocardium), the negative contribution from the outer layers is amplified more than the positive contribution from the inner layers. This \"lever arm\" effect ensures that the epicardial torque dominates. Therefore, the net integral is negative, and $M_z  0$.\n\n4.  **Interpret the Rotation Sign:**\n    *   By the right-hand rule, a negative moment vector $M_z$ (pointing in the $-\\mathbf{e}_z$ direction, from apex to base) generates a clockwise (CW) rotation in the standard mathematical sense.\n    *   The problem specifies the viewpoint is from the apex looking toward the base (i.e., looking along the $-\\mathbf{e}_z$ axis). When viewing a CW rotation from this perspective, the motion appears counter-clockwise (CCW).\n    *   The problem defines a CCW rotation as positive ($+1$).\n    *   The calculated net moment $M_z$ is an internal torque that twists the apex relative to the base. Thus, the apex rotates in the direction of this net torque. **Apical rotation is CCW, which corresponds to a sign of $+1$.**\n    *   By Newton's third law (action-reaction), the moment exerted by the apex on the base is equal and opposite ($-M_z$). This positive moment causes a mathematically CCW rotation, which, when viewed from the apex, appears as a clockwise (CW) rotation. **Basal rotation is CW, which corresponds to a sign of $-1$.**\n\nThis leads to the characteristic wringing motion of the heart, with the apex and base rotating in opposite directions.",

The Green–Lagrange strain is a proper finite strain measure derived directly from continuum mechanics principles without linearization.
