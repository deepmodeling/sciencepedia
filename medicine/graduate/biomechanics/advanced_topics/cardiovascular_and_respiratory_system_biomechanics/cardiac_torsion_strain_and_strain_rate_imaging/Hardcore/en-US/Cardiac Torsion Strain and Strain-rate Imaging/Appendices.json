Let the local orthonormal basis be $\\{\\mathbf{e}_{r}, \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}, \\mathbf{e}_{z}\\}$, where $\\mathbf{e}_{z}$ is the longitudinal axis directed from base toward apex.

            "solution": "The objective is to determine the sign of apical and basal rotation based on the torsional moment generated by active fiber contraction. The rotation is a consequence of the net torque developed within the ventricular wall. We will derive this torque from the given active stress tensor.\n\nFirst, we express the active stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_a = T_{a}\\,\\mathbf{f}(r)\\otimes\\mathbf{f}(r)$, in the cylindrical coordinate system $\\{\\mathbf{e}_{r}, \\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}, \\mathbf{e}_{z}\\}$.\nThe fiber vector is $\\mathbf{f}(r) = \\cos\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin\\psi(r)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}$.\nThe dyadic product $\\mathbf{f}\\otimes\\mathbf{f}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}\\otimes\\mathbf{f} = \\cos^2\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta} + \\sin^2\\psi\\,\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{z} + \\cos\\psi\\sin\\psi\\,(\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{z} + \\mathbf{e}_{z}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta})\n$$\nThe total Cauchy stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = -p\\,\\mathbf{I} + \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_a$. The component of this tensor relevant for torsion about the longitudinal axis $\\mathbf{e}_z$ is the shear stress $\\sigma_{z\\theta}$ (or $\\sigma_{\\theta z}$). From the expression for $\\mathbf{f}\\otimes\\mathbf{f}$, we identify the component multiplying $\\mathbf{e}_{z}\\otimes\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) = T_{a}\\,\\cos\\psi(r)\\sin\\psi(r) = \\frac{T_{a}}{2}\\sin(2\\psi(r))\n$$\nSince the stress tensor is symmetric, $\\sigma_{\\theta z} = \\sigma_{z\\theta}$. This shear stress, acting on a transverse plane (a plane with normal $\\mathbf{e}_z$), generates a tangential force in the $\\mathbf{e}_{\\theta}$ direction. This force produces a moment about the central $z$-axis.\n\nThe net torsional moment, $M_z$, exerted across a transverse cross-section of the cylinder is found by integrating the moment contributions from the shear stress over the area of the ring. The moment contribution from an infinitesimal area element $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$ is $dM_z = (\\text{force}) \\times (\\text{lever arm}) = (\\sigma_{z\\theta}\\,dA) \\times r$.\n$$\nM_z = \\int_{A} r \\, \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) \\, dA = \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r \\, \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) \\, (r \\, dr \\, d\\theta)\n$$\nDue to axisymmetry, $\\sigma_{z\\theta}$ is independent of $\\theta$, so the integration over $\\theta$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$.\n$$\nM_z = 2\\pi \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\sigma_{z\\theta}(r) \\, dr = 2\\pi \\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\left( \\frac{T_{a}}{2}\\sin(2\\psi(r)) \\right) \\, dr\n$$\nThe sign of this moment $M_z$ determines the direction of the resulting twist. The a priori sign of $M_z$ is defined by the right-hand rule (a positive $M_z$ corresponds to a CCW torque as viewed from the positive $z$-direction). The constant factors $\\pi$ and $T_a$ are positive. The sign of $M_z$ is therefore determined by the sign of the integral $\\int_{r_{\\mathrm{endo}}}^{r_{\\mathrm{epi}}} r^2 \\sin(2\\psi(r)) \\, dr$.\n\nLet's analyze the integrand. The helix angle $\\psi(r)$ varies linearly from $+60^{\\circ}$ (endocardium) to $-60^{\\circ}$ (epicardium).\n*   In the sub-endocardium ($r$ is close to $r_{\\mathrm{endo}}$), $\\psi(r) > 0$. For $0  \\psi(r) \\le 60^{\\circ}$, we have $0  2\\psi(r) \\le 120^{\\circ}$, which means $\\sin(2\\psi(r)) > 0$.\n*   In the sub-epicardium ($r$ is close to $r_{\\mathrm{epi}}$), $\\psi(r)  0$. For $-60^{\\circ} \\le \\psi(r)  0$, we have $-120^{\\circ} \\le 2\\psi(r)  0$, which means $\\sin(2\\psi(r))  0$.\nThe integral for $M_z$ thus has a positive part from the inner wall and a negative part from the outer wall. The total sign depends on which part dominates. The integrand is weighted by $r^2$. Since the radius $r$ is larger in the outer wall (sub-epicardium) than in the inner wall (sub-endocardium), the negative contribution from the outer layers receives a greater weighting. As a result, the integral is negative, and we conclude that $M_z  0$.\n\nThis negative sign for $M_z$ corresponds to a moment vector pointing in the $-\\mathbf{e}_z$ direction (from apex to base). By the right-hand rule, this generates a clockwise (CW) rotation.\n\nWe must now reconcile this with the problem's viewing convention.\n*   The viewpoint is from the apex, looking toward the base. This is a view along the $-\\mathbf{e}_z$ direction.\n*   A mathematical CW rotation in the $xy$-plane, when viewed from along the $-\\mathbf{e}_z$ axis, appears as a counter-clockwise (CCW) rotation to the observer.\n*   Our calculated moment $M_z  0$ causes a CW rotation in the standard sense. When viewed from the apex, this appears as a CCW rotation.\n*   The problem defines a CCW rotation as positive ($+1$). So the net torque corresponds to a positive ($+1$) rotation.\n\nThis torque is internal to the myocardium. By Newton's third law, the moment exerted by the basal portion of the ventricle on the apical portion is $M_z$ (which we found causes a CCW, or positive, rotation). Conversely, the moment exerted by the apical portion on the basal portion is $-M_z$ (which causes a CW, or negative, rotation).\nThis results in the characteristic \"wringing\" motion of the heart: the apex rotates relative to the base.\n*   **Apical Rotation:** The apex is relatively unconstrained and is twisted by the net torque calculated. It will rotate in the CCW direction as viewed from the apex. The sign is positive ($+1$).\n*   **Basal Rotation:** The base is more constrained and is twisted by the reactive torque in the opposite direction. It will rotate in the CW direction. The sign is negative ($-1$).\n\nThis result is consistent with physiological observations during systole.",
