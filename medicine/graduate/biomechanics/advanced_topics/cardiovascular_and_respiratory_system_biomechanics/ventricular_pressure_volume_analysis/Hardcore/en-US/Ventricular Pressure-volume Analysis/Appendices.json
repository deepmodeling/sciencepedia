            "problem": "A cardiovascular biomechanics study models the human left ventricle using the time-varying elastance concept at end-systole under steady-state conditions. In this framework, the End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR) is approximated as linear with a slope called end-systolic elastance $E_{es}$ and a volume-axis intercept $V_0$, such that the end-systolic pressure $P_{es}$ depends on the end-systolic volume $ESV$ relative to $V_0$. The arterial load is summarized by arterial elastance $E_a$, defined at steady state as the ratio of end-systolic pressure to stroke volume $SV$. The stroke volume is the ejected volume in a beat and is the difference between end-diastolic volume $EDV$ and end-systolic volume $ESV$. Assuming a single-beat coupling equilibrium between the ventricle and the arterial system, use these core definitions to derive the coupled end-systolic operating point and compute the unknown quantities.\n\nGiven $E_{es} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{ml}$, $V_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{ml}$, $EDV = 140\\,\\mathrm{ml}$, and $E_a = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{ml}$, determine the end-systolic volume $ESV$, the stroke volume $SV$, and the end-systolic pressure $P_{es}$ that satisfy the ventricular-arterial coupling constraints implied by the above definitions.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the steady-state operating point of a coupled ventricular-arterial system, described by the time-varying elastance model. The solution involves solving a system of algebraic equations derived from the definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the given definitions into mathematical equations.\n\n1.  The End-Systolic Pressure-Volume Relationship (ESPVR) is given as a linear function. The end-systolic pressure, $P_{es}$, is determined by the end-systolic elastance, $E_{es}$, and the difference between the end-systolic volume, $ESV$, and the volume-axis intercept, $V_0$. This relationship is expressed as:\n    $$P_{es} = E_{es} (ESV - V_0)$$\n\n2.  The arterial load is characterized by the arterial elastance, $E_a$, which is defined as the ratio of end-systolic pressure to the stroke volume, $SV$.\n    $$E_a = \\frac{P_{es}}{SV}$$\n    This can be rearranged to express $P_{es}$ in terms of the arterial properties:\n    $$P_{es} = E_a \\cdot SV$$\n\n3.  The stroke volume, $SV$, is defined as the volume of blood ejected during one cardiac cycle, which is the difference between the end-diastolic volume, $EDV$, and the end-systolic volume, $ESV$.\n    $$SV = EDV - ESV$$\n\nThe principle of ventricular-arterial coupling at steady state implies that the end-systolic pressure generated by the ventricle must equal the end-systolic pressure sustained by the arterial system. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $P_{es}$:\n$$E_{es} (ESV - V_0) = E_a \\cdot SV$$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with three unknowns ($P_{es}$, $ESV$, $SV$). However, we can substitute the expression for $SV$ from the third definition into our coupled equation to obtain a single equation with a single unknown, $ESV$.\n$$E_{es} (ESV - V_0) = E_a (EDV - ESV)$$\n\nThe next step is to solve this linear equation for $ESV$. We expand both sides of the equation:\n$$E_{es} \\cdot ESV - E_{es} \\cdot V_0 = E_a \\cdot EDV - E_a \\cdot ESV$$\n\nNow, we collect all terms involving $ESV$ on one side of the equation and all other terms on the opposite side:\n$$E_{es} \\cdot ESV + E_a \\cdot ESV = E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0$$\n\nFactoring out $ESV$ on the left-hand side yields:\n$$ESV (E_{es} + E_a) = E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $ESV$ by dividing by the term $(E_{es} + E_a)$:\n$$ESV = \\frac{E_a \\cdot EDV + E_{es} \\cdot V_0}{E_{es} + E_a}$$\n\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values: $E_{es} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{ml}$, $V_0 = 10\\,\\mathrm{ml}$, $EDV = 140\\,\\mathrm{ml}$, and $E_a = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}/\\mathrm{ml}$.\n$$ESV = \\frac{(1.2)(140) + (2.0)(10)}{2.0 + 1.2}$$\n$$ESV = \\frac{168 + 20}{3.2}$$\n$$ESV = \\frac{188}{3.2}$$\n$$ESV = 58.75\\,\\mathrm{ml}$$\n\nWith the value of $ESV$ determined, we can now calculate the stroke volume, $SV$, using its definition:\n$$SV = EDV - ESV$$\n$$SV = 140 - 58.75$$\n$$SV = 81.25\\,\\mathrm{ml}$$\n\nFinally, we can calculate the end-systolic pressure, $P_{es}$. We can use either of the two expressions for $P_{es}$ as a means of verifying our calculations. Using the arterial load definition:\n$$P_{es} = E_a \\cdot SV$$\n$$P_{es} = 1.2 \\cdot 81.25$$\n$$P_{es} = 97.5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\n\nAs a verification, we can calculate $P_{es}$ using the ventricular ESPVR definition:\n$$P_{es} = E_{es} (ESV - V_0)$$\n$$P_{es} = 2.0 (58.75 - 10)$$\n$$P_{es} = 2.0 (48.75)$$\n$$P_{es} = 97.5\\,\\mathrm{mmHg}$$\nThe consistent results from both calculations confirm the accuracy of our derived values for $ESV$, $SV$, and $P_{es}$.",

The task is to estimate $E_{es}$ and $V_0$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the observed pressures and the model predictions under the assumption of independent, identically distributed Gaussian measurement noise on pressure. Then, report parameter uncertainties derived from a linear approximation of the estimator covariance under the Gaussian noise model.\n\nUse the following fundamental base:\n- Definition of elastance: end-systolic elastance $E_{es}$ is the slope of the end-systolic pressure-volume relation.\n- Linear approximation of the end-systolic relation: near end-systole, pressure changes approximately linearly with volume with slope $E_{es}$ and intercept determined by $V_0$.\n- Classical least squares estimation under independent Gaussian noise minimizes the sum of squared residuals and yields a normal-equation-based estimator for linear models. Under this model, the covariance of the linear parameter estimates is proportional to the inverse of the design normal matrix, scaled by the residual variance. Uncertainty in transformed parameters is obtained by first-order error propagation using the Jacobian of the transformation.\n\nImplement a program that, for each test case, performs the following:\n1.
