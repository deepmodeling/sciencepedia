This practice provides a foundational exercise in quantifying this effect. By applying the definition of surface pressure, $\\pi$, as a reduction from the clean interface tension, $\\gamma_{\\text{clean}}$, you will calculate the effective surface tension, $\\gamma_{\\text{eff}}$, and then use the Young-Laplace equation to determine the pressure required to keep a model alveolus open .

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of surface tension and fluid mechanics, specifically the Young-Laplace equation and the concept of surface pressure. All necessary data are provided, the values are physically realistic for a pulmonary alveolus, and the question is well-posed and objective.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two steps, as directed by the problem statement. First, we determine the effective interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{\\text{eff}}$, of the alveolar liquid lining in the presence of surfactant. Second, we use this value to compute the alveolar opening pressure difference, $\\Delta P_{\\text{open}}$, using the Young-Laplace equation for a spherical interface.\n\nLet the given variables be:\n- The radius of the alveolus, $R = 100\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\n- The interfacial tension of the clean air-water interface, $\\gamma_{\\text{clean}} = 72\\,\\text{mN/m}$.\n- The surface pressure generated by the surfactant monolayer, $\\pi = 50\\,\\text{mN/m}$.\n\nThe problem defines surface pressure, $\\pi$, as the reduction in interfacial tension relative to the clean interface.

            "problem": "An alveolus is modeled as a thin liquid-coated, approximately spherical air–liquid interface with uniform surfactant coverage. At quasi-static opening, neglect contributions from tissue elastic recoil and airflow inertia and assume the only load opposing expansion is interfacial surface tension.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the expression for the opening pressure of a spherical alveolus, a calculation of the change in this pressure for a given change in radius at constant surface tension, and an interpretation of the result.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Opening Pressure**\n\nThe problem models the alveolus as a spherical air-liquid interface where the primary force opposing expansion is interfacial surface tension. The opening pressure, $P_{\\text{open}}$, is defined as the transmural pressure difference, $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{inside}} - P_{\\text{outside}}$, required to balance the forces due to surface tension. We can derive this relationship by considering the mechanical equilibrium of a hemisphere of the spherical interface.\n\nLet the radius of the sphere be $R$ and the uniform surface tension of the liquid film be $\\gamma$. The pressure difference $\\Delta P$ acts over the equatorial circular area of the hemisphere, creating an outward-directed force $F_P$. This force is given by:\n$$F_P = \\Delta P \\cdot A = \\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2$$\nwhere $A = \\pi R^2$ is the area of the disk.\n\nThe surface tension $\\gamma$ acts along the circumference of this equatorial circle. The total force due to surface tension, $F_{\\gamma}$, is directed inward, opposing the expansion, and is given by the product of the surface tension and the length of the circumference, $L = 2\\pi R$:\n$$F_{\\gamma} = \\gamma \\cdot L = \\gamma \\cdot 2\\pi R$$\nNote that for a thin film with two interfaces (e.g., a soap bubble), this force would be doubled. However, the alveolar lining is a single air-liquid interface, so the factor is $2\\pi R$, not $4\\pi R$.\n\nFor the hemisphere to be in mechanical equilibrium, these two opposing forces must be equal:\n$$F_P = F_{\\gamma}$$\n$$\\Delta P \\cdot \\pi R^2 = \\gamma \\cdot 2\\pi R$$\nSolving for the pressure difference $\\Delta P$, which we define as the opening pressure $P_{\\text{open}}$, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{open}} = \\Delta P = \\frac{2\\pi R \\gamma}{\\pi R^2}$$\n$$P_{\\text{open}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\nThis is the Young-Laplace equation for a single spherical interface.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Change in Opening Pressure**\n\nWe are asked to compute the change in opening pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}}$, when the alveolar radius increases from $R_1$ to $R_2$. The surface tension $\\gamma$ is given as constant.\n\nThe given values are:\nSurface tension, $\\gamma = 20\\,\\text{mN/m} = 20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{N/m}$.\nInitial radius, $R_1 = 80\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 8 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$.\nFinal radius, $R_2 = 160\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 160 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 1.6 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nThe change in opening pressure is defined as:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = P_{\\text{open}}(R_2) - P_{\\text{open}}(R_1)$$\nUsing the derived formula $P_{\\text{open}}(R) = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_2} - \\frac{2\\gamma}{R_1} = 2\\gamma \\left(\\frac{1}{R_2} - \\frac{1}{R_1}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = 2 \\cdot (20 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{N/m}) \\left(\\frac{1}{160 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}} - \\frac{1}{80 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m}}\\right)$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = (40 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{1}{1.6 \\times 10^{-4}} - \\frac{1}{0.8 \\times 10^{-4}}\\right)\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = (4 \\times 10^{-2}) \\left(\\frac{10^4}{1.6} - \\frac{10^4}{0.8}\\right)\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = (4 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot 10^4 \\left(\\frac{1}{1.6} - \\frac{2}{1.6}\\right)\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = 400 \\left(-\\frac{1}{1.6}\\right)\\,\\text{Pa}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = - \\frac{400}{1.6}\\,\\text{Pa} = - \\frac{4000}{16}\\,\\text{Pa} = -250\\,\\text{Pa}$$\nThe result, $-250\\,\\text{Pa}$, has two significant figures. The problem asks for rounding to three significant figures, which would be $-2.50 \\times 10^2\\,\\text{Pa}$, or $-250\\,\\text{Pa}$ if the trailing zero is considered significant. We will write it as $-250$.\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Result**\n\nThe calculated change in opening pressure, $\\Delta P_{\\text{open,change}} = -250\\,\\text{Pa}$, is negative. This signifies that as the alveolus expands (its radius increases from $80\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ to $160\\,\\mu\\text{m}$), the pressure required to maintain its patency *decreases*.\n\nThis radius dependence, $P_{\\text{open}} \\propto 1/R$, has critical implications for the stability of an interconnected network of alveoli, especially under the problem's assumption of a constant surface tension $\\gamma$. In a system of interconnected alveoli of different sizes sharing a common airway pressure, smaller alveoli (smaller $R$) would require a higher pressure to stay open compared to larger alveoli (larger $R$). Consequently, air would preferentially flow from the smaller alveoli into the larger ones, causing the small alveoli to collapse (atelectasis) and the large ones to over-distend. This describes a fundamentally unstable system.\n\nThe magnitude of the change, $250\\,\\text{Pa}$ (approximately $2.5\\,\\text{cm H}_2\\text{O}$), is physiologically significant, highlighting the severity of this instability. The model with constant surface tension thus demonstrates precisely why pulmonary surfactant is essential: real surfactant reduces surface tension more effectively at smaller radii (as surfactant molecules are compressed on the interface), thereby counteracting the $1/R$ effect and promoting alveolar stability throughout the breathing cycle.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the static compliance of a spherical alveolus model and the calculation of a ratio comparing the contributions of tissue elasticity and surface tension. The solution will be developed from first principles as specified.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Static Compliance $C(E, \\gamma; R)$\n\nThe total transmural pressure $P$ required to maintain the alveolus at a radius $R$ is the sum of the pressure contribution from the elastic tension in the membrane, $P_{\\text{tissue}}$, and the contribution from the surface tension of the fluid lining, $P_{\\text{surface}}$.\n$$P = P_{\\text{tissue}} + P_{\\text{surface}}$$\n\n1.  **Surface Tension Contribution ($P_{\\text{surface}}$)**: The pressure difference across a spherical air-liquid interface is given by the Young-Laplace equation:\n    $$P_{\\text{surface}} = \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n    where $\\gamma$ is the surface tension and $R$ is the radius of the sphere.\n\n2.  **Tissue Elasticity Contribution ($P_{\\text{tissue}}$)**: A force balance on a hemisphere of the elastic membrane equates the force from the pressure, $F_P = P_{\\text{tissue}} \\cdot (\\pi R^2)$, to the total tensional force in the membrane cross-section, $F_T = \\sigma \\cdot (2\\pi R h)$. Here, $\\sigma$ is the tensile stress in the membrane (assumed uniform and isotropic) and $h$ is the membrane thickness.\n    $$P_{\\text{tissue}} (\\pi R^2) = \\sigma (2\\pi R h)$$\n    Solving for $P_{\\text{tissue}}$ yields:\n    $$P_{\\text{tissue}} = \\frac{2h\\sigma}{R}$$\n\n3.  **Constitutive Relation (Stress-Strain)**: The membrane is under plane stress with equal biaxial tension, so the principal stresses are $\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\sigma_{\\phi} = \\sigma$. The corresponding strains are $\\epsilon_{\\theta} = \\epsilon_{\\phi} = \\epsilon$. According to Hooke's law for an isotropic linear elastic material under plane stress, the relationship between strain and stress is:\n    $$\\epsilon = \\frac{1}{E}(\\sigma - \\nu\\sigma) = \\frac{\\sigma(1-\\nu)}{E}$$\n    where $E$ is the elastic modulus and $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio. Rearranging for stress gives:\n    $$\\sigma = \\frac{E\\epsilon}{1-\\nu}$$\n\n4.  **Geometric Relation (Strain-Radius)**: For small strains, the circumferential strain $\\epsilon$ is defined as the change in circumference divided by the reference circumference:\n    $$\\epsilon = \\frac{2\\pi R - 2\\pi R_0}{2\\pi R_0} = \\frac{R-R_0}{R_0}$$\n    where $R_0$ is the reference radius at zero strain.\n\n5.  **Pressure-Radius Relationship ($P(R)$)**: By substituting the expressions for strain and stress into the equation for $P_{\\text{tissue}}$, we can express the total pressure $P$ as a function of radius $R$.\n    First, substitute the strain expression into the stress expression:\n    $$\\sigma = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}\\left(\\frac{R-R_0}{R_0}\\right)$$\n    Next, substitute this stress into the expression for $P_{\\text{tissue}}$:\n    $$P_{\\text{tissue}} = \\frac{2h}{R} \\left[ \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}\\left(\\frac{R-R_0}{R_0}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2hE}{(1-\\nu)R_0}\\frac{R-R_0}{R}$$\n    The total pressure is then:\n    $$P(R) = \\frac{2hE}{(1-\\nu)R_0}\\left(1 - \\frac{R_0}{R}\\right) + \\frac{2\\gamma}{R}$$\n\n6.  **Derivation of Compliance ($C$)**: Compliance is defined as $C = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}$.
