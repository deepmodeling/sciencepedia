            "introduction": "To study balance, we must first measure it. The Center of Pressure ($COP$), derived from force plate data, is a fundamental metric that reflects the neuromuscular system's moment-to-moment control of the body's center of mass. This practice will guide you through deriving the $COP$ calculation from first principles of rigid-body mechanics, demonstrating how raw ground reaction forces and moments are transformed into a meaningful measure of postural sway . Understanding this derivation is essential for correctly interpreting balance data and appreciating the subtleties of the measurement process.",

            "problem": "A healthy adult subject performs quiet bipedal stance on a six-component rigid force plate for balance assessment aimed at quantifying the integration of vestibular and proprioceptive inputs. The Center of Pressure (COP) is defined as the point on the top surface of the plate where the resultant ground reaction force would act to produce the same external wrench on the body as the actual distributed contact. The inertial frame is right-handed with axes: $x$ anterior, $y$ right-lateral, and $z$ superior. Positive forces follow axis directions and positive moments follow the right-hand rule. The instrumented origin $O$ of the plate’s measurement frame is located a fixed distance $h$ below the top surface, along $-z$. Assume a rigid plate and rigid foot-contact patch, and that any foot-floor free moment exists only about the $z$-axis within the contact (i.e., no net free moments about $x$ or $y$).\n\nStarting from first principles of rigid-body mechanics, specifically: (i) the definition of moment about a point, $\\boldsymbol{M}_{O}=\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}\\times \\boldsymbol{F}+\\boldsymbol{M}_{\\text{free}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}$ is the position vector from $O$ to the COP point $P$ on the top surface, $\\boldsymbol{F}$ is the ground reaction force vector, and $\\boldsymbol{M}_{\\text{free}}$ is any free moment at the contact; and (ii) the sign conventions described above, derive closed-form expressions for the COP coordinates on the top surface, $COP_{x}$ and $COP_{y}$, in terms of measured $\\boldsymbol{F}=(F_{x},F_{y},F_{z})$, measured $\\boldsymbol{M}_{O}=(M_{x},M_{y},M_{z})$, and the offset $h$. Clearly state the sign conventions required for these expressions to be valid and enumerate the calibration requirements that must be met to ensure accurate COP-based balance metrics in this context.\n\nThen, for a particular instant during quiet stance, the calibrated measurements at the origin $O$ are:\n- $F_{x}=22~\\text{N}$, $F_{y}=-15~\\text{N}$, $F_{z}=690~\\text{N}$,\n- $M_{x}=11.5~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, $M_{y}=-8.1~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$,\nand the origin offset is $h=0.040~\\text{m}$ (origin $4.0~\\text{cm}$ below the top surface).\n\nUsing your derived expressions, compute $COP_{x}$ and $COP_{y}$ at the top surface. Express both coordinates in meters and round your answers to four significant figures. Provide the final numerical answer as a two-entry row in the order $COP_{x}$, $COP_{y}$.",
            "solution": "The goal is to locate the Center of Pressure (COP) on the top surface of the force plate. We adopt a right-handed inertial frame with axes $x$ anterior, $y$ right-lateral, and $z$ superior. Ground reaction forces are measured at the plate’s origin $O$, located a distance $h$ below the top surface along $-z$. The COP point $P$ lies on the top surface, so its position vector in the global frame can be denoted $(COP_{x},COP_{y},0)$, and the vector from $O$ to $P$ is $\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}=(COP_{x},~COP_{y},~h)$ because $O$ is at $z=-h$ and $P$ is at $z=0$.\n\nWe start from the rigid-body moment definition about the origin $O$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{M}_{O}=\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}\\times \\boldsymbol{F}+\\boldsymbol{M}_{\\text{free}},\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{F}=(F_{x},F_{y},F_{z})$ is the resultant ground reaction force, and $\\boldsymbol{M}_{\\text{free}}$ is any free (distributed) moment that cannot be represented by a single resultant force acting at a point. Under the stated assumption that the free moment exists only about the $z$-axis, we have $\\boldsymbol{M}_{\\text{free}}=(0,0,M_{\\text{free},z})$, implying the $x$ and $y$ components of $\\boldsymbol{M}_{O}$ arise solely from $\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}\\times \\boldsymbol{F}$.\n\nCompute the cross product component-wise:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}\\times \\boldsymbol{F}=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nCOP_{y}\\,F_{z}-h\\,F_{y} \\\\\nh\\,F_{x}-COP_{x}\\,F_{z} \\\\\nCOP_{x}\\,F_{y}-COP_{y}\\,F_{x}\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nEquating the $x$ and $y$ components to the measured $M_{x}$ and $M_{y}$ (since $M_{\\text{free}}$ contributes only to the $z$-component):\n$$\nM_{x}=COP_{y}\\,F_{z}-h\\,F_{y}, \\qquad M_{y}=h\\,F_{x}-COP_{x}\\,F_{z}.\n$$\nSolve these for $COP_{x}$ and $COP_{y}$:\n$$\nCOP_{x}=\\frac{h\\,F_{x}-M_{y}}{F_{z}}, \\qquad COP_{y}=\\frac{M_{x}+h\\,F_{y}}{F_{z}}.\n$$\nThese expressions reduce to the familiar forms $COP_{x}=-M_{y}/F_{z}$ and $COP_{y}=M_{x}/F_{z}$ when $h=0$ (origin on the contact plane) and when shear forces $F_{x}$ and $F_{y}$ do not introduce offset-dependent contributions.\n\nSign conventions required for validity:\n- The coordinate system is right-handed with $x$ anterior (forward), $y$ right-lateral, $z$ superior (upward).\n- Forces $F_{x},F_{y},F_{z}$ are positive along $+x,+y,+z$ respectively; $F_{z}>0$ when the plate pushes up on the subject.\n- Moments $M_{x},M_{y},M_{z}$ about the origin follow the right-hand rule about their respective axes.\n- The origin $O$ is located at $z=-h$ relative to the top surface, so $\\boldsymbol{r}_{OP}=(COP_{x},COP_{y},h)$.\n\nCalibration requirements for accurate COP-based balance metrics:\n- Channel zeroing: offsets must be removed so that $\\boldsymbol{F}$ and $\\boldsymbol{M}_{O}$ are referenced to the unloaded state (e.g., subtract baseline drifts).\n- Sensitivity scaling: apply the validated calibration gains (and, if applicable, cross-talk compensation) to convert raw outputs (voltage or counts) into physical units (newtons and newton-meters).\n- Coordinate alignment: ensure the plate’s local axes are aligned to the global biomechanical frame; otherwise, rotate the measured wrench into the defined right-handed frame before computing COP.\n- Geometric reference: use the correct $h$ (distance from the origin to the top surface contact plane). Misestimation of $h$ biases $COP_{x}$ and $COP_{y}$ through the shear-force terms.\n- Range and linearity: verify $F_{z}$ remains sufficiently above zero so that division by $F_{z}$ is well-conditioned; COP is undefined when $F_{z}\\approx 0$.\n- Consistent sign convention documentation: record the polarity of moment channels; incorrect sign will reflect COP across axes.\n\nNow compute the numerical COP for the given instant using $h=0.040~\\text{m}$, $F_{x}=22~\\text{N}$, $F_{y}=-15~\\text{N}$, $F_{z}=690~\\text{N}$, $M_{x}=11.5~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$, and $M_{y}=-8.1~\\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$:\n$$\nCOP_{x}=\\frac{h\\,F_{x}-M_{y}}{F_{z}}=\\frac{(0.040)(22)-(-8.1)}{690}=\\frac{0.88+8.10}{690}=\\frac{8.98}{690}\\approx 0.01301449275~\\text{m},\n$$\n$$\nCOP_{y}=\\frac{M_{x}+h\\,F_{y}}{F_{z}}=\\frac{11.5+(0.040)(-15)}{690}=\\frac{11.5-0.60}{690}=\\frac{10.90}{690}\\approx 0.01579710145~\\text{m}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed in meters:\n$$\nCOP_{x}\\approx 0.01301~\\text{m}, \\qquad COP_{y}\\approx 0.01580~\\text{m}.\n$$\nThese COP coordinates represent the instantaneous location of the resultant ground reaction’s point of application on the plate’s top surface, providing a quantitative metric that reflects neuromuscular control integrating proprioceptive and vestibular inputs during quiet stance.",

The human body during quiet stance is often simplified as a single-link inverted pendulum, a model that captures the essential challenge of balancing a top-heavy mass against gravity.

Assume quasi-static conditions so that angular acceleration is negligible. Let the passive ankle stiffness be represented by a linear torsional spring with stiffness $k$ (in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m/rad}$), generating a passive ankle torque $u_{\\mathrm{pass}}=-k\\theta$ that opposes the lean. The vestibular and proprioceptive systems together provide an accurate estimate of $\\theta$, and the central nervous system (CNS) uses this estimate to command an active ankle torque $u$.\n\nUsing moment balance about the ankle joint under quasi-static conditions, derive and compute the active ankle torque $u$ required to maintain a $2^{\\circ}$ anterior lean.

            "introduction": "Having defined the mechanical problem of balance, we now address how the brain solves it using imperfect sensory information. The central nervous system combines inputs from multiple sensors, like the vestibular and proprioceptive systems, to form a robust estimate of body orientation.
