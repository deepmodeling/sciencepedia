This exercise operationalizes this classic tension by having you calculate the expected net benefit of a new implant using Quality-Adjusted Life Years ($QALYs$)—a utilitarian approach—while simultaneously checking for compliance with a non-negotiable deontological risk threshold. It demonstrates how a proposal can be justifiable under one ethical framework but forbidden by another.",

            "problem": "A biomechanical research team proposes a randomized controlled trial of a new knee implant. Each participant is expected to gain an average of $0.4$ Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY), where Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) is a utility-weighted measure of health outcomes combining lifespan and quality of life on a $[0,1]$ scale. There is a risk of a serious adverse event per participant with probability $0.01$, and each serious adverse event is assessed to produce a utility change of $-5$ QALYs for the affected participant.

The provided numerical values are plausible within the context of a clinical trial for a surgical implant. The definition of a QALY scale does not contradict the assignment of a utility change of $-5$, as this change represents a loss of QALYs (equivalent to 5 years of life in perfect health), not a point on the quality-of-life scale itself.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions, data, and constraints to calculate the two requested quantities, $U_{net}$ and $I$. The path to a unique solution is clearly defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language, using established terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe task is to compute two quantities: the expected net utility per participant, $U_{net}$, and a deontological compliance indicator, $I$.\n\n#### Part 1: Expected Net Utility ($U_{net}$)\nThe problem defines the expected net utility by additively combining beneficial and harmful outcomes. This suggests modeling the total utility $U$ as the sum of a benefit component $U_{benefit}$ and a harm component $U_{harm}$. By the linearity of expectation, the expected net utility is the sum of the expectations of these components:\n$$U_{net} = E[U] = E[U_{benefit} + U_{harm}] = E[U_{benefit}] + E[U_{harm}]$$\nThe problem states, \"Each participant is expected to gain an average of $0.4$ Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY)\". This is a direct statement of the expected value of the benefit component.\n$$E[U_{benefit}] = 0.4 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nThe harm component, $U_{harm}$, is a random variable associated with the risk of a serious adverse event (SAE). We are given:\n- The probability of an SAE, $P_{SAE}$, is $0.01$.\n- The utility change associated with an SAE is $-5$ QALYs.\n- If no SAE occurs (with probability $1 - P_{SAE} = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99$), the utility change from this harm component is $0$.\n\nThe expected value of the harm component, $E[U_{harm}]$, is calculated as the sum of the utility of each outcome multiplied by its probability:\n$$E[U_{harm}] = (-5) \\times P_{SAE} + (0) \\times (1 - P_{SAE})$$\nSubstituting the given value for $P_{SAE}$:\n$$E[U_{harm}] = (-5) \\times 0.01 + (0) \\times 0.99 = -0.05 \\text{ QALYs}$$\nNow, the expected net utility $U_{net}$ is found by summing the expected benefit and the expected harm:\n$$U_{net} = E[U_{benefit}] + E[U_{harm}] = 0.4 + (-0.05) = 0.35 \\text{ QALYs}$$\n\n#### Part 2: Deontological Compliance Indicator ($I$)\nThe second task is to determine the value of the binary compliance indicator $I$. The rule for $I$ is given as:\n$$I = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } P_{SAE} \\le P_{threshold} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$$\nWe are provided with the necessary values:\n- The probability of a serious adverse event, $P_{SAE} = 0.01$.\n- The deontological risk constraint threshold, $P_{threshold} = 0.005$.\n\nWe must evaluate the inequality $P_{SAE} \\le P_{threshold}$:\n$$0.01 \\le 0.005$$\nThis inequality is false, as $0.01$ is greater than $0.005$. Therefore, the condition for $I=1$ is not met. According to the definition, the indicator $I$ must be $0$.\n$$I = 0$$\nThis indicates that the study does not comply with the specified deontological risk constraint.\n\n#### Final Answer Assembly\nThe computed values are $U_{net} = 0.35$ and $I=0$. These are to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} U_{net} & I \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe final result is the matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.35 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

The task is to compute the sample Gini coefficient for a given distribution of benefits and evaluate it against a specified equity constraint.\n\nLet the distribution of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gains be denoted by the set $X = \\{x_1, x_2, x_3,x_4\\}$, where the values are given as $\\{0.3, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9\\}$.

            "problem": "A research ethics committee is evaluating a multicenter biomechanical clinical trial that introduces a neurally controlled upper-limb prosthesis integrating invasive sensors. To model the ethical acceptability of the protocol, assume the committee uses a linear multi-criteria aggregation across three ethically salient dimensions: patient autonomy, expected utility, and distributive justice. Each criterion is normalized to lie in the interval $\\left[0, 1\\right]$ and is aggregated using nonnegative weights that sum to $1$. The committee requires that the aggregated ethical score meet or exceed a minimum acceptability threshold for approval.\n\nFundamental base and modeling assumptions:\n- By decision theory, expected utility is a well-defined quantity $U \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$ representing anticipated net benefit across outcomes.\n- Patient autonomy is represented by a normalized score $A \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$ based on informed consent quality, decisional capacity safeguards, and voluntariness.\n- Distributive justice is represented by a normalized score $J \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$ that operationalizes equitable access and burden sharing, including recruitment inclusivity and post-trial access plans.\n- The committee applies a linear Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model, aggregating via weights $w_{A}$, $w_{U}$, and $w_{J}$ that satisfy $w_{A} \\ge 0$, $w_{U} \\ge 0$, $w_{J} \\ge 0$, and $w_{A} + w_{U} + w_{J} = 1$.\n- The protocol is approved if the aggregated score $S$ satisfies $S \\ge \\tau$, where $\\tau \\in \\left(0, 1\\right)$ is the acceptability threshold set by the committee.\n\nTo analyze sensitivity to emphasis on distributive justice, the committee parametrizes the justice weight as $w_{J} = \\alpha$ with $\\alpha \\in \\left[0, 1\\right]$.
