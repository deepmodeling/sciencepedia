A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is governed by the fundamental principles of continuum mechanics, specifically Cauchy's postulate on the existence of a traction vector and the resulting Cauchy's theorem. Cauchy's theorem states that the traction vector $T$ acting on a surface with a unit normal vector $n$ is given by a linear transformation of $n$ by the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$. This relationship is expressed as:\n$$\nT = \\sigma n\n$$\nThe problem provides the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ in a Cartesian frame $\\{x,y,z\\}$ and the unit normal vector $n$ for a specific plane within the material. We write these as column vectors for matrix multiplication:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 30 & 12 & -5 \\\\ 12 & 20 & 8 \\\\ -5 & 8 & 15 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first step is to compute the traction vector $T$ by carrying out the matrix-vector product:\n$$\nT = \\begin{pmatrix} 30 & 12 & -5 \\\\ 12 & 20 & 8 \\\\ -5 & 8 & 15 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 30(1) + 12(2) - 5(2) \\\\ 12(1) + 20(2) + 8(2) \\\\ -5(1) + 8(2) + 15(2) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 30 + 24 - 10 \\\\ 12 + 40 + 16 \\\\ -5 + 16 + 30 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 44 \\\\ 68 \\\\ 41 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 44/3 \\\\ 68/3 \\\\ 41/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{MPa}\n$$\nThe traction vector $T$ can be uniquely decomposed into two orthogonal components: a normal component, $T_n$, parallel to the unit normal $n$, and a shear component, $T_s$, perpendicular to $n$ (and thus lying in the plane). The relationship is $T = T_n + T_s$. The magnitudes of these components are the scalar normal stress $\\sigma_n$ and the shear traction magnitude $\\tau$, respectively.\n\nThe scalar normal stress $\\sigma_n$ is the projection of the traction vector $T$ onto the direction of the unit normal $n$. It is computed via the dot product:\n$$\n\\sigma_n = T \\cdot n = \\begin{pmatrix} 44/3 \\\\ 68/3 \\\\ 41/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{9} \\left( (44)(1) + (68)(2) + (41)(2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_n = \\frac{1}{9} (44 + 136 + 82) = \\frac{262}{9} \\text{ MPa}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the shear traction, $\\tau$, can be determined using the Pythagorean theorem applied to the orthogonal decomposition of the traction vector: $|T|^2 = |T_n|^2 + |T_s|^2$. The magnitude of the normal component is $|T_n| = |\\sigma_n n| = |\\sigma_n| |n| = |\\sigma_n|$, since $n$ is a unit vector. The magnitude of the shear component is by definition $\\tau = |T_s|$. Therefore, the relationship is $|T|^2 = \\sigma_n^2 + \\tau^2$, which allows for the calculation of $\\tau$ as $\\tau = \\sqrt{|T|^2 - \\sigma_n^2}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the squared magnitude of the traction vector, $|T|^2$:\n$$\n|T|^2 = T \\cdot T = \\left(\\frac{44}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{68}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{41}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9} \\left( 44^2 + 68^2 + 41^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n|T|^2 = \\frac{1}{9} (1936 + 4624 + 1681) = \\frac{8241}{9} = \\frac{2747}{3} \\text{ MPa}^2\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\tau^2$ and subsequently $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau^2 = |T|^2 - \\sigma_n^2 = \\frac{2747}{3} - \\left(\\frac{262}{9}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2747 \\times 27}{3 \\times 27} - \\frac{262^2}{81}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau^2 = \\frac{74169}{81} - \\frac{68644}{81} = \\frac{74169 - 68644}{81} = \\frac{5525}{81} \\text{ MPa}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\tau = \\sqrt{\\frac{5525}{81}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5525}}{9} \\text{ MPa}\n$$\nThe problem requires numerical results rounded to four significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in continuum mechanics, well-posed with a complete and consistent setup, and expressed in objective, formal language. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in stress analysis.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Eigenvalue Problem\n\nThe analysis begins with the Cauchy traction law, which relates the stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ at a point to the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ acting on a plane with unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ passing through that point:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}(\\boldsymbol{n}) = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThe traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ can be decomposed into a component normal to the plane, $\\boldsymbol{t}_N$, and a component tangential (or shear) to the plane, $\\boldsymbol{t}_S$. The normal component is the projection of $\\boldsymbol{t}$ onto the direction of $\\boldsymbol{n}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_N = (\\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the normal stress on the plane is therefore $\\sigma_N = \\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}$.\nThe shear component is the part of $\\boldsymbol{t}$ remaining after the normal component is subtracted:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t}_S = \\boldsymbol{t} - \\boldsymbol{t}_N = \\boldsymbol{t} - (\\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the condition under which the shear traction is zero. This corresponds to setting $\\boldsymbol{t}_S = \\boldsymbol{0}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t} - (\\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})\\boldsymbol{n} = \\boldsymbol{0}\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t} = (\\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThis equation states that for the shear traction to be zero, the traction vector $\\boldsymbol{t}$ must be collinear with the plane's normal vector $\\boldsymbol{n}$. The quantity $(\\boldsymbol{t} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n})$ is a scalar, which we can denote by $\\lambda$. This scalar represents the magnitude of the normal stress on the plane. The condition becomes:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{t} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nSubstituting the Cauchy traction law $\\boldsymbol{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}$ into this condition yields:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n} = \\lambda\\boldsymbol{n}\n$$\nThis is the standard form of an eigenvalue problem. The orientations of planes with zero shear traction are given by the unit vectors $\\boldsymbol{n}$ that are eigenvectors of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The corresponding eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are the magnitudes of the normal stresses acting on these planes.\n\n**Biomechanical Interpretation**: The planes experiencing zero shear are called the *principal planes*. The corresponding normal vectors $\\boldsymbol{n}$ are the *principal directions*, and the normal stresses $\\lambda$ on these planes are the *principal stresses*. In the context of biomechanics, these represent the directions and magnitudes of pure tension or compression within the tissue. Materials, especially fibrous ones like soft tissues, often have different mechanical properties and failure limits under normal stress (tension/compression) versus shear stress. Identifying the principal planes and stresses is therefore fundamental to predicting how a tissue will deform and whether it might fail under a given load.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of Principal Directions\n\nWe are given the stress tensor:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}=\\begin{pmatrix}\n120 & 40 & 0 \\\\\n40 & 80 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 60\n\\end{pmatrix}\\,\\text{kPa}\n$$\nTo find the principal stresses (eigenvalues) and principal directions (eigenvectors), we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\lambda\\boldsymbol{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix}\n120 - \\lambda & 40 & 0 \\\\\n40 & 80 - \\lambda & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 60 - \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nExpanding the determinant along the third row gives:\n$$\n(60 - \\lambda) \\left[ (120 - \\lambda)(80 - \\lambda) - (40)(40) \\right] = 0\n$$\nThis gives one immediate eigenvalue: $\\lambda_3 = 60$. The other two eigenvalues are roots of the quadratic equation from the bracketed term:\n$$\n(120 - \\lambda)(80 - \\lambda) - 1600 = 0 \\\\\n\\lambda^2 - 200\\lambda + 9600 - 1600 = 0 \\\\\n\\lambda^2 - 200\\lambda + 8000 = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{200 \\pm \\sqrt{(-200)^2 - 4(1)(8000)}}{2} = \\frac{200 \\pm \\sqrt{40000 - 32000}}{2} = \\frac{200 \\pm \\sqrt{8000}}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\sqrt{8000} = \\sqrt{1600 \\cdot 5} = 40\\sqrt{5}$, the eigenvalues are:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{200 \\pm 40\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 100 \\pm 20\\sqrt{5}\n$$\nSo, the three principal stresses are $\\lambda_1 = 100 + 20\\sqrt{5}$, $\\lambda_2 = 100 - 20\\sqrt{5}$, and $\\lambda_3 = 60$.\n\nNow, we find the corresponding eigenvectors (unit normal vectors $\\boldsymbol{n}$).\n\nFor $\\lambda_3 = 60$: $(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - 60\\boldsymbol{I})\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\boldsymbol{0}$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n60 & 40 & 0 \\\\\n40 & 20 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} n_{3x} \\\\ n_{3y} \\\\ n_{3z} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe first two rows give $60n_{3x} + 40n_{3y} = 0$ and $40n_{3x} + 20n_{3y} = 0$. This system implies $n_{3x}=0$ and $n_{3y}=0$. The third row, $0 \\cdot n_{3z} = 0$, leaves $n_{3z}$ arbitrary. For a unit vector, we must have $n_{3z}=1$ (or $-1$). We choose the positive direction.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor the other two eigenvectors, which lie in the $x,y$-plane, we can find the rotation angle $\\theta$ from the $x$-axis that diagonalizes the $2 \\times 2$ sub-tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_{xy} = \\begin{pmatrix} 120 & 40 \\\\ 40 & 80 \\end{pmatrix}$. The angle is given by:\n$$\n\\tan(2\\theta) = \\frac{2\\tau_{xy}}{\\sigma_{xx} - \\sigma_{yy}} = \\frac{2(40)}{120 - 80} = \\frac{80}{40} = 2\n$$\nFrom a right triangle with opposite side $2$ and adjacent side $1$, the hypotenuse is $\\sqrt{2^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{5}$. Thus, $\\cos(2\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and $\\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}$. We use the half-angle identities to find $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$ for the principal direction $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$:\n$$\n\\cos^2\\theta = \\frac{1+\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} = \\frac{1+1/\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}+1}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1-\\cos(2\\theta)}{2} = \\frac{1-1/\\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}\n$$\nFor the larger eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 100 + 20\\sqrt{5}$, the eigenvector corresponds to a counter-clockwise rotation, so both $\\cos\\theta$ and $\\sin\\theta$ are positive.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos\\theta \\\\ \\sin\\theta \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe third eigenvector $\\boldsymbol{n}_2$ (for $\\lambda_2 = 100 - 20\\sqrt{5}$) must be orthogonal to both $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_3$. It is found by a further $\\pi/2$ rotation from $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ in the $x,y$-plane.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta+\\pi/2) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta+\\pi/2) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin\\theta \\\\ \\cos\\theta \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Justification and Verification\n\nJustification via Mohr's Circle: For the $x,y$-plane stress state $(\\sigma_{xx}, \\sigma_{yy}, \\tau_{xy}) = (120, 80, 40)$, the Mohr's circle has its center at $C = (\\frac{120+80}{2}, 0) = (100, 0)$. The radius is $R = \\sqrt{(\\frac{120-80}{2})^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{20^2+40^2} = \\sqrt{2000} = 20\\sqrt{5}$. The principal stresses are $C \\pm R = 100 \\pm 20\\sqrt{5}$, confirming the eigenvalues for the $x,y$ sub-problem. The angle $2\\theta_p$ from the reference axis on the circle to the principal stress axis is given by $\\tan(2\\theta_p) = \\frac{\\tau_{xy}}{(\\sigma_{xx}-\\sigma_{yy})/2} = \\frac{40}{20} = 2$. This corresponds to a physical rotation of $\\theta_p = \\frac{1}{2}\\arctan(2)$, precisely matching the derivation for the eigenvector orientation. Since $\\tau_{xz}$ and $\\tau_{yz}$ are zero, the $z$-axis is a principal axis, and the state $(\\sigma_{zz}, 0)$ is a point on the circle, giving $\\lambda_3=60$. This geometric interpretation fully supports the algebraic results.\n\nExplicit Verification: We confirm $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}_i = \\lambda_i\\boldsymbol{n}_i$.\n\nFor $\\boldsymbol{n}_3$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 120 & 40 & 0 \\\\ 40 & 80 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 60 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 60 \\end{pmatrix} = 60\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\lambda_3\\boldsymbol{n}_3\n$$\nThis is verified.\n\nFor $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_2$, let's use an unnormalized eigenvector for $\\lambda_1$, $\\boldsymbol{v}_1 = (2, \\sqrt{5}-1, 0)^T$, from the relation $(1-\\sqrt{5})n_{1x} + 2n_{1y} = 0$.\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\boldsymbol{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 120 & 40 & 0 \\\\ 40 & 80 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 60 \\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ \\sqrt{5}-1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 240+40(\\sqrt{5}-1) \\\\ 80+80(\\sqrt{5}-1) \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 200+40\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 80\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we check if this equals $\\lambda_1 \\boldsymbol{v}_1$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1\\boldsymbol{v}_1 = (100+20\\sqrt{5})\\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ \\sqrt{5}-1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 200+40\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 100\\sqrt{5}-100+20(5)-20\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 200+40\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 80\\sqrt{5} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is verified. Since $\\boldsymbol{n}_2$ corresponds to a real eigenvalue of a symmetric tensor, it is guaranteed to be orthogonal to $\\boldsymbol{n}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{n}_3$ and will also satisfy the eigenvalue equation. The set of computed normals is correct.\n\nThe three unit normals representing the orientations of planes with zero shear traction are:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{n}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sqrt{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\boldsymbol{n}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sqrt{\\frac{5-\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ \\sqrt{\\frac{5+\\sqrt{5}}{10}} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\boldsymbol{n}_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$",

I will first validate the problem statement according to the specified criteria and then, if it is valid, proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A thin, homogeneous, planar sheet of fibrous soft tissue is considered.\n- The loading is in quasi-static equilibrium.\n- A two-dimensional plane stress state applies.\n- The principal stresses are $\\sigma_{1} = 82\\,\\text{kPa}$ and $\\sigma_{2} = 31\\,\\text{kPa}$.\n- The principal directions are along orthonormal basis vectors $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{2}$.\n- The Cauchy stress tensor in the $(\\mathbf{e}_{1}, \\mathbf{e}_{2})$ basis is diagonal: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The dominant collagen fiber direction is a unit vector $\\mathbf{f}$.\n- The angle of $\\mathbf{f}$ from $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ toward $\\mathbf{e}_{2}$ is $\\alpha = 40^\\circ$.\n- An incision line has a direction $\\mathbf{c}$, at an angle $\\theta$ from $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$.\n- The outward unit normal to the incision is $\\mathbf{n}$, with $\\mathbf{n} \\perp \\mathbf{c}$.\n- The traction vector on the incision surface is $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$.\n- The quantity to be minimized is the fiber-parallel shear component, defined as $S(\\theta) = |\\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{f}| = |\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}|$.\n- The objective is to find the optimal incision angle $\\theta^\\star$ that minimizes $S(\\theta)$.\n- The final answer for $\\theta^\\star$ should be in degrees, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly based on the principles of continuum mechanics (Cauchy stress tensor, traction vector, principal stresses, plane stress). The application to the biomechanics of soft tissue, including the role of oriented collagen fibers, is a standard and well-established area of research. The stress values are plausible for biological soft tissues. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed:** The problem is a well-defined mathematical optimization task: find the value of $\\theta$ that minimizes a given function $S(\\theta)$. The function $S(\\theta)$ is continuous and defined on a compact domain (e.g., $\\theta \\in [0, 180^\\circ]$), which guarantees the existence of a minimum. The structure allows for a unique solution within a given interval of $180^\\circ$.\n3.  **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous mathematical and physical terminology. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n4.  **Completeness:** All necessary data ($\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$, $\\alpha$) and definitions are provided to formulate and solve the problem. The setup is self-contained and free of contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. I will now proceed to solve it.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem requires us to find the angle $\\theta^\\star$ that minimizes the quantity $S(\\theta) = |\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}|$. To do this, we must first express the vectors $\\mathbf{f}$ and $\\mathbf{n}$ and the tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ in a common coordinate system. We will use the principal basis $(\\mathbf{e}_{1}, \\mathbf{e}_{2})$.\n\nIn this basis, the vectors and tensor are represented by their components:\nThe Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$ is given as diagonal in this basis:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 82 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 31 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\text{kPa}\n$$\nThe fiber direction vector $\\mathbf{f}$ forms an angle $\\alpha=40^\\circ$ with $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$. Its components are:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\ \\sin(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe incision line direction $\\mathbf{c}$ forms an angle $\\theta$ with $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$, so $\\mathbf{c} = (\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))^{\\top}$. The outward unit normal $\\mathbf{n}$ is orthogonal to $\\mathbf{c}$. We can obtain $\\mathbf{n}$ by rotating $\\mathbf{c}$ by $\\pm 90^\\circ$. Let's choose a counter-clockwise rotation of $90^\\circ$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\theta+90^\\circ) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta+90^\\circ) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe choice of direction for $\\mathbf{n}$ (i.e., rotation by $+90^\\circ$ vs. $-90^\\circ$) will only change the sign of the product $\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$, which does not affect the absolute value $S(\\theta)$.\n\nNow, we compute the product $\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$. First, we compute the traction vector $\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\,\\mathbf{n} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sigma_{2} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sigma_{1}\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sigma_{2}\\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the dot product of $\\mathbf{t}$ with $\\mathbf{f}$, which is $\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\mathbf{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{f}^{\\top}\\mathbf{t} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\alpha) & \\sin(\\alpha) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -\\sigma_{1}\\sin(\\theta) \\\\ \\sigma_{2}\\cos(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix} = -\\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta) + \\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nThe quantity to be minimized is the absolute value of this expression:\n$$\nS(\\theta) = | \\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta) |\n$$\nTo find the minimum value of $S(\\theta)$, we can equivalently find the minimum of $S(\\theta)^2$, as the squaring function is monotonic for non-negative values. This avoids dealing with the absolute value.\n$$\nS(\\theta)^2 = (\\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta))^2\n$$\nThe minimum possible value of $S(\\theta)^2$ is $0$, since it is a squared quantity. This minimum is achieved if and only if the term inside the parenthesis is zero:\n$$\n\\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta) - \\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)\\cos(\\theta) = \\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)\\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nAssuming $\\cos(\\theta) \\neq 0$ and $\\cos(\\alpha) \\neq 0$, we can divide to solve for $\\tan(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sin(\\theta)}{\\cos(\\theta)} = \\frac{\\sigma_{2}\\sin(\\alpha)}{\\sigma_{1}\\cos(\\alpha)}\n$$\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\sigma_{2}}{\\sigma_{1}} \\tan(\\alpha)\n$$\nThis equation gives the angle $\\theta^\\star$ that makes the fiber-parallel shear component equal to zero, which is the absolute minimum value for $S(\\theta)$.\n\nWe can now substitute the given numerical values: $\\sigma_{1} = 82\\,\\text{kPa}$, $\\sigma_{2} = 31\\,\\text{kPa}$, and $\\alpha = 40^\\circ$.\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta^\\star) = \\frac{31}{82} \\tan(40^\\circ)\n$$\nTo find $\\theta^\\star$, we take the arctangent of both sides:\n$$\n\\theta^\\star = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{31}{82} \\tan(40^\\circ)\\right)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the numerical value:\n$$\n\\tan(40^\\circ) \\approx 0.83909963\n$$\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta^\\star) \\approx \\frac{31}{82} \\times 0.83909963 \\approx 0.37804878 \\times 0.83909963 \\approx 0.31722830\n$$\n$$\n\\theta^\\star = \\arctan(0.31722830) \\approx 17.60359^\\circ\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $1$, $7$, $6$, and $0$. The fifth digit is $3$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\theta^\\star \\approx 17.60^\\circ\n$$\nThis is the optimal incision angle that minimizes the magnitude of the shear traction component parallel to the collagen fibers.",
