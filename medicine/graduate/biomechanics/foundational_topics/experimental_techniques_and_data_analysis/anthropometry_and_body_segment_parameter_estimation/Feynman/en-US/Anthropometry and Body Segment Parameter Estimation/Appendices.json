            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biomechanics and integral calculus, using a standard geometric approximation (a frustum) for a body segment. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters: the proximal circumference $C_{p} = 0.35\\ \\text{m}$, distal circumference $C_{d} = 0.25\\ \\text{m}$, segment length $L = 0.40\\ \\text{m}$, and uniform density $\\rho = 1050\\ \\text{kg/m}^{3}$. The relationships and methods are clearly defined, allowing for the existence of a unique and meaningful solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nTo compute the mass of the shank segment, we model it as a truncated right circular cone (frustum). The total mass $m$ is the integral of the uniform density $\\rho$ over the volume $V$ of the frustum:\n$$m = \\iiint_V \\rho \\, dV = \\rho V$$\nWe can determine the volume by integrating the area of circular cross-sections along the length of the segment. Let us establish a coordinate system where the long axis of the segment aligns with the $x$-axis, with the proximal end at $x=0$ and the distal end at $x=L$.\n\nThe radius of the circular cross-section, $r$, is a function of the position $x$. The problem states that the radius varies linearly along the long axis. Therefore, we can express the radius function as $r(x) = ax + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants.\n\nWe can determine these constants from the boundary conditions at the proximal and distal ends. The circumference $C$ is related to the radius $r$ by $C = 2\\pi r$, so $r = C/(2\\pi)$.\n\nAt the proximal end ($x=0$):\nThe circumference is $C_{p} = 0.35\\ \\text{m}$, so the radius is $r_{p} = \\frac{C_{p}}{2\\pi}$.\nThus, $r(0) = a(0) + b = r_{p}$, which gives $b = r_{p}$.\n\nAt the distal end ($x=L$):\nThe circumference is $C_{d} = 0.25\\ \\text{m}$, so the radius is $r_{d} = \\frac{C_{d}}{2\\pi}$.\nThus, $r(L) = aL + b = r_{d}$.\nSubstituting $b = r_{p}$, we get $aL + r_{p} = r_{d}$, which gives $a = \\frac{r_{d} - r_{p}}{L}$.\n\nThe radius as a function of $x$ is therefore:\n$$r(x) = \\left(\\frac{r_{d} - r_{p}}{L}\\right)x + r_{p}$$\nThe volume of an infinitesimally thin disk at position $x$ with thickness $dx$ is given by $dV$. The area of this disk is $A(x) = \\pi [r(x)]^2$. The volume element is $dV = A(x)dx = \\pi [r(x)]^2 dx$.\n\nTo find the total volume $V$, we integrate $dV$ from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$V = \\int_{0}^{L} \\pi [r(x)]^2 dx = \\pi \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{r_{d} - r_{p}}{L}\\right)x + r_{p} \\right]^2 dx$$\nTo solve the integral, let $u = \\left(\\frac{r_{d} - r_{p}}{L}\\right)x + r_{p}$. Then $du = \\left(\\frac{r_{d} - r_{p}}{L}\\right)dx$, which means $dx = \\frac{L}{r_{d} - r_{p}}du$. The limits of integration change from $x=0 \\rightarrow u=r_{p}$ and $x=L \\rightarrow u=r_{d}$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$V = \\pi \\int_{r_{p}}^{r_{d}} u^2 \\left(\\frac{L}{r_{d} - r_{p}}\\right) du = \\frac{\\pi L}{r_{d} - r_{p}} \\left[ \\frac{u^3}{3} \\right]_{r_{p}}^{r_{d}}$$\n$$V = \\frac{\\pi L}{3(r_{d} - r_{p})} (r_{d}^3 - r_{p}^3)$$\nUsing the difference of cubes formula, $r_{d}^3 - r_{p}^3 = (r_{d} - r_{p})(r_{d}^2 + r_{d}r_{p} + r_{p}^2)$, we simplify the expression for the volume:\n$$V = \\frac{\\pi L}{3} (r_{p}^2 + r_{p}r_{d} + r_{d}^2)$$\nThe mass $m$ is $\\rho V$:\n$$m = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho \\pi L (r_{p}^2 + r_{p}r_{d} + r_{d}^2)$$\nNow, we substitute $r_{p} = \\frac{C_{p}}{2\\pi}$ and $r_{d} = \\frac{C_{d}}{2\\pi}$:\n$$m = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho \\pi L \\left( \\left(\\frac{C_{p}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{C_{p}}{2\\pi}\\right)\\left(\\frac{C_{d}}{2\\pi}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{C_{d}}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 \\right)$$\n$$m = \\frac{1}{3} \\rho \\pi L \\left( \\frac{C_{p}^2}{4\\pi^2} + \\frac{C_{p}C_{d}}{4\\pi^2} + \\frac{C_{d}^2}{4\\pi^2} \\right)$$\n$$m = \\frac{\\rho \\pi L}{3 \\cdot 4\\pi^2} (C_{p}^2 + C_{p}C_{d} + C_{d}^2) = \\frac{\\rho L}{12\\pi} (C_{p}^2 + C_{p}C_{d} + C_{d}^2)$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\rho = 1050\\ \\text{kg/m}^{3}$\n$L = 0.40\\ \\text{m}$\n$C_{p} = 0.35\\ \\text{m}$\n$C_{d} = 0.25\\ \\text{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term in the parentheses:\n$C_{p}^2 = (0.35)^2 = 0.1225\\ \\text{m}^2$\n$C_{p}C_{d} = (0.35)(0.25) = 0.0875\\ \\text{m}^2$\n$C_{d}^2 = (0.25)^2 = 0.0625\\ \\text{m}^2$\nSum $= C_{p}^2 + C_{p}C_{d} + C_{d}^2 = 0.1225 + 0.0875 + 0.0625 = 0.2725\\ \\text{m}^2$\n\nNow, we calculate the mass $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{(1050\\ \\text{kg/m}^{3})(0.40\\ \\text{m})}{12\\pi} (0.2725\\ \\text{m}^2)$$\n$$m = \\frac{420}{12\\pi} (0.2725)\\ \\text{kg} = \\frac{35}{\\pi} (0.2725)\\ \\text{kg}$$\n$$m = \\frac{9.5375}{\\pi}\\ \\text{kg} \\approx 3.0359806\\ \\text{kg}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$m \\approx 3.036\\ \\text{kg}$$",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. The task is to derive the transverse mass moment of inertia for a uniform solid cylinder and then compute a numerical value for specific parameters.\n\nThe first step is to derive the analytical expression for the transverse mass moment of inertia of the cylinder about the $y$-axis, which passes through its center of mass. The cylinder has mass $m$, radius $r$, and length $L$. It is oriented with its longitudinal axis along the $x$-axis, centered at the origin. Thus, it occupies the space defined by $x \\in [-L/2, L/2]$ and $y^2 + z^2 \\le r^2$.\n\nThe mass moment of inertia about an axis is defined by the integral:\n$$I = \\int r_{\\perp}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}m$$\nwhere $r_{\\perp}$ is the perpendicular distance from the axis of rotation to the mass element $\\mathrm{d}m$. For rotation about the $y$-axis, a point at coordinates $(x, y, z)$ has a squared perpendicular distance of $r_{\\perp,y}^2 = x^2 + z^2$.\n\nThe cylinder is uniform, so it has a constant mass density $\\rho$. The total mass $m$ is the product of density and volume $V$:\n$$m = \\rho V = \\rho (\\pi r^2 L)$$\nTherefore, the density is $\\rho = \\frac{m}{\\pi r^2 L}$.\n\nA differential mass element $\\mathrm{d}m$ can be expressed as $\\mathrm{d}m = \\rho\\,\\mathrm{d}V$, where $\\mathrm{d}V$ is a differential volume element. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\mathrm{d}V = \\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z$.\n\nThe moment of inertia about the $y$-axis, $I_y$, is then:\n$$I_y = \\int_{\\text{cylinder}} r_{\\perp,y}^2\\,\\mathrm{d}m = \\int_{\\text{cylinder}} (x^2 + z^2) \\rho\\,\\mathrm{d}V$$\nSince $\\rho$ is constant, we can write:\n$$I_y = \\rho \\iiint_{\\text{cylinder}} (x^2 + z^2) \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z$$\nThis integral can be separated into two parts:\n$$I_y = \\rho \\iiint_{\\text{cylinder}} x^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z + \\rho \\iiint_{\\text{cylinder}} z^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}x\\,\\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z$$\nWe can evaluate these integrals by integrating over the cylinder's volume. The limits for $x$ are from $-L/2$ to $L/2$. For each $x$, the cross-section is a disk of radius $r$ in the $y,z$-plane, described by $y^2 + z^2 \\le r^2$.\n\nLet's evaluate the first term:\n$$ \\rho \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} x^2 \\left( \\iint_{y^2+z^2 \\le r^2} \\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z \\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe inner double integral is the area of the circular cross-section, which is $\\pi r^2$.\n$$ \\rho \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} x^2 (\\pi r^2) \\mathrm{d}x = \\rho \\pi r^2 \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} x^2 \\mathrm{d}x $$\n$$ \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} x^2 \\mathrm{d}x = \\left[\\frac{x^3}{3}\\right]_{-L/2}^{L/2} = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{L}{2}\\right)^3\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{L^3}{8} + \\frac{L^3}{8}\\right) = \\frac{L^3}{12} $$\nSo the first term is $\\rho \\pi r^2 \\frac{L^3}{12}$.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the second term:\n$$ \\rho \\int_{-L/2}^{L/2} \\left( \\iint_{y^2+z^2 \\le r^2} z^2 \\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z \\right) \\mathrm{d}x $$\nThe inner integral $\\iint z^2 \\mathrm{d}y\\,\\mathrm{d}z$ is the second moment of area of a disk of radius $r$ about a diameter (the $y$-axis).

The components of $\\mathbf{r}$ are $x_i = x'_i + s_i$.\n\nThe inertia tensor about the SJC is:\n$$ I^{\\text{SJC}}_{ij} = \\int (\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\mathbf{r} \\delta_{ij} - x_i x_j) dm $$\nSubstitute $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}' + \\mathbf{s}$:\n$$ I^{\\text{SJC}}_{ij} = \\int \\left[ ((\\mathbf{r}'+\\mathbf{s})\\cdot(\\mathbf{r}'+\\mathbf{s}))\\delta_{ij} - (x'_i+s_i)(x'_j+s_j) \\right] dm $$\n$$ I^{\\text{SJC}}_{ij} = \\int \\left[ (r'^2 + s^2 + 2\\mathbf{r}'\\cdot\\mathbf{s})\\delta_{ij} - (x'_ix'_j + x'_is_j + s_ix'_j + s_is_j) \\right] dm $$\nWe can separate the integral into three parts:\n$$ I^{\\text{SJC}}_{ij} = \\int (r'^2\\delta_{ij} - x'_ix'_j)dm + \\int (s^2\\delta_{ij} - s_is_j)dm + \\int (2(\\mathbf{r}'\\cdot\\mathbf{s})\\delta_{ij} - x'_is_j - s_ix'_j)dm $$\nThe first term is the definition of the inertia tensor about the CoM, $I_{ij}^{\\text{CoM}}$.\nThe second term is constant with respect to the integration, so it becomes $m(s^2\\delta_{ij} - s_is_j)$, where $m = \\int dm$.\nThe third term vanishes because the origin of the primed system is the CoM, which implies $\\int x'_k dm = 0$ for any component $k$.\nThus, we arrive at the parallel axis theorem for the inertia tensor:\n$$ I^{\\text{SJC}}_{ij} = I^{\\text{CoM}}_{ij} + m(s^2\\delta_{ij} - s_is_j) $$\n\n**Calculation of the Inertia Tensor at the SJC**\n\nThe given displacement vector $\\mathbf{d}$ points from the CoM to the SJC: $\\mathbf{d} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{SJC}} - \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{CoM}}$.\nThe vector $\\mathbf{s}$ required for the theorem is from the new axis location (SJC) to the old one (CoM): $\\mathbf{s} = \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{CoM}} - \\mathbf{r}_{\\text{SJC}} = -\\mathbf{d}$.\nGiven $\\mathbf{d} = (0.03, -0.20, 0.02)\\ \\text{m}$, the shift vector is $\\mathbf{s} = (-0.03, 0.20, -0.02)\\ \\text{m}$.\nWe have $s_x=-0.03\\ \\text{m}$, $s_y=0.20\\ \\text{m}$, $s_z=-0.02\\ \\text{m}$, and $m=2.2\\ \\text{kg}$.\nThe squared magnitude of $\\mathbf{s}$ is $s^2 = s_x^2 + s_y^2 + s_z^2 = (-0.03)^2 + (0.20)^2 + (-0.02)^2 = 0.0009 + 0.04 + 0.0004 = 0.0413\\ \\text{m}^2$.\n\nThe diagonal components of $I^{\\text{SJC}}$ are:\n$I_{xx}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{xx}^{\\text{CoM}} + m(s_y^2 + s_z^2) = 0.021 + 2.2(0.20^2 + (-0.02)^2) = 0.021 + 2.2(0.0404) = 0.021 + 0.08888 = 0.10988\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n$I_{yy}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{yy}^{\\text{CoM}} + m(s_x^2 + s_z^2) = 0.00176 + 2.2((-0.03)^2 + (-0.02)^2) = 0.00176 + 2.2(0.0013) = 0.00176 + 0.00286 = 0.00462\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n$I_{zz}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{zz}^{\\text{CoM}} + m(s_x^2 + s_y^2) = 0.019 + 2.2((-0.03)^2 + 0.20^2) = 0.019 + 2.2(0.0409) = 0.019 + 0.08998 = 0.10898\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n\nThe off-diagonal components (products of inertia) are:\n$I_{xy}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{xy}^{\\text{CoM}} - m s_x s_y = 0 - 2.2(-0.03)(0.20) = 0.0132\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n$I_{xz}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{xz}^{\\text{CoM}} - m s_x s_z = 0 - 2.2(-0.03)(-0.02) = -0.00132\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n$I_{yz}^{\\text{SJC}} = I_{yz}^{\\text{CoM}} - m s_y s_z = 0 - 2.2(0.20)(-0.02) = 0.0088\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n\nSo, the inertia tensor about the SJC is:\n$$ \\mathbf{I}^{\\text{SJC}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.10988  0.0132  -0.00132 \\\\ 0.0132  0.00462  0.0088 \\\\ -0.00132  0.0088  0.10898 \\end{pmatrix} \\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2 $$\n\n**Calculation of the Scalar Rotational Inertia**\n\nThe scalar rotational inertia, $I_u$, about an axis defined by a unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ is given by the quadratic form $I_u = \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T \\mathbf{I} \\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$.\nThe unit vector is $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}} = (\\cos 30^\\circ, \\sin 30^\\circ, 0)$.\nLet $u_x = \\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $u_y = \\sin 30^\\circ = \\frac{1}{2}$, and $u_z = 0$.\nThe scalar inertia $I_u$ is calculated with respect to the SJC, so we use $\\mathbf{I}^{\\text{SJC}}$:\n$$ I_u = \\sum_{i,j} I_{ij}^{\\text{SJC}} u_i u_j = I_{xx}^{\\text{SJC}} u_x^2 + I_{yy}^{\\text{SJC}} u_y^2 + I_{zz}^{\\text{SJC}} u_z^2 + 2 I_{xy}^{\\text{SJC}} u_x u_y + 2 I_{xz}^{\\text{SJC}} u_x u_z + 2 I_{yz}^{\\text{SJC}} u_y u_z $$\nSince $u_z=0$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ I_u = I_{xx}^{\\text{SJC}} u_x^2 + I_{yy}^{\\text{SJC}} u_y^2 + 2 I_{xy}^{\\text{SJC}} u_x u_y $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$u_x^2 = (\\cos 30^\\circ)^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 = \\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.\n$u_y^2 = (\\sin 30^\\circ)^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$.\n$u_x u_y = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$.\n\n$$ I_u = (0.10988)(0.75) + (0.00462)(0.25) + 2(0.0132)\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) $$\n$$ I_u = 0.08241 + 0.001155 + 0.0066\\sqrt{3} $$\n$$ I_u \\approx 0.083565 + 0.0066 \\times 1.7320508 $$\n$$ I_u \\approx 0.083565 + 0.011431535 $$\n$$ I_u \\approx 0.0949965\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $I_u \\approx 0.09500\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.",
