            "problem": "A high-speed force platform measures the three-dimensional ground reaction force under the right foot of an elite sprinter during the stance phase of maximal sprinting on a level synthetic track. Adopt a Coulomb friction model at the shoe–surface interface: the tangential ground reaction force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)$ lies within a friction cone defined by $|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)| \\leq \\mu F_{n}(t)$, where $F_{n}(t)$ is the normal component of the ground reaction force and $\\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction. Assume the no-slip condition requires that the inequality holds for all stance times $t$ in $[0, T]$, with stance duration $T$.\n\nThe laboratory reports that, within the measurement resolution, the instant of maximal tangential resultant force magnitude coincides with the instant of maximal normal force during this stance.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the specified criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A Coulomb friction model is adopted: $|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)| \\leq \\mu F_{n}(t)$.\n- $\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)$ is the tangential ground reaction force vector.\n- $F_{n}(t)$ is the normal component of the ground reaction force.\n- $\\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction.\n- The no-slip condition requires the inequality to hold for all times $t$ in the stance duration $[0, T]$.\n- The instant of maximal tangential resultant force magnitude, $\\max|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)|$, coincides with the instant of maximal normal force, $\\max F_{n}(t)$.\n- At this specific instant, the measured force components are:\n    - Anterior–posterior component: $F_{x} = -1800 \\, \\text{N}$.\n    - Mediolateral component: $F_{y} = 450 \\, \\text{N}$.\n    - Vertical (normal) component: $F_{z} = 2200 \\, \\text{N}$.\n- The vertical axis is aligned with the surface normal, so $F_{n} = F_{z}$.\n- The tangential force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{t}$ lies in the plane spanned by the $x$- and $y$-axes.\n- The task is to compute the minimum required coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_{\\text{req}}$.\n- The final result must be a dimensionless number rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics (forces, friction) as applied to the established field of biomechanics. The Coulomb friction model is a standard, first-order approximation for such interactions. The force values, while large, are within the physically realistic range for elite athletes during maximal exertion.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information to calculate a unique value for the minimum required coefficient of friction. It clearly defines the model, the relevant variables, and the data at the critical instant to be analyzed. While it simplifies the real-world problem by assuming the maximum of the ratio $\\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)|}{F_{n}(t)}$ occurs at the given instant, this is a standard and necessary simplification for a well-posed problem of this type, and the problem text guides this interpretation.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language.\n\nThe problem is found to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It contains no logical contradictions, physical impossibilities, or ambiguous terms. We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the principles of friction as defined in the problem. According to Newton's Third Law, the ground reaction force $\\mathbf{F}$ is the force exerted by the ground on the sprinter's foot. This force can be decomposed into a component normal to the surface, $F_{n}$, and a component tangential to the surface, $\\mathbf{F}_{t}$.\n\nThe Coulomb model for static friction states that slip is prevented as long as the magnitude of the tangential force does not exceed the maximum possible static friction force. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)| \\leq \\mu F_{n}(t)$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the coefficient of static friction between the shoe and the track surface.\n\nFor the no-slip condition to be maintained throughout the entire stance phase, from time $t=0$ to $t=T$, this inequality must hold for all $t \\in [0, T]$. This can be expressed by rearranging the inequality to solve for $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu \\geq \\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)|}{F_{n}(t)}$$\nTo ensure this condition holds for the entire duration, the coefficient of friction $\\mu$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum value that the ratio $\\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)|}{F_{n}(t)}$ achieves during the stance phase. This maximum value is defined as the minimum required coefficient of static friction, $\\mu_{\\text{req}}$.\n$$\\mu_{\\text{req}} = \\max_{t \\in [0, T]} \\left( \\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}(t)|}{F_{n}(t)} \\right)$$\n\nThe problem provides the components of the ground reaction force at a specific instant, which is stated to be when both the tangential force magnitude $|\\mathbf{F}_{t}|$ and the normal force $F_{n}$ are at their maximum values. We are instructed to use these data to compute $\\mu_{\\text{req}}$, which implies that we are to assume this instant corresponds to the maximum of the ratio $\\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}|}{F_{n}}$.\n\nThe ground reaction force vector $\\mathbf{F}$ has components $(F_{x}, F_{y}, F_{z})$.\nAccording to the problem statement:\n- The normal force component is the vertical component: $F_{n} = F_{z}$.\n- The tangential force vector $\\mathbf{F}_{t}$ is composed of the anterior-posterior and mediolateral components: $\\mathbf{F}_{t} = F_{x} \\mathbf{i} + F_{y} \\mathbf{j}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the tangential force vector is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem in two dimensions:\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}| = \\sqrt{F_{x}^{2} + F_{y}^{2}}$$\nUsing the provided data at the critical instant:\n$F_{x} = -1800 \\, \\text{N}$\n$F_{y} = 450 \\, \\text{N}$\n$F_{z} = 2200 \\, \\text{N}$\n\nThe magnitude of the tangential force is:\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}| = \\sqrt{(-1800)^{2} + (450)^{2}} \\, \\text{N}$$\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}| = \\sqrt{3240000 + 202500} \\, \\text{N}$$\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}| = \\sqrt{3442500} \\, \\text{N}$$\n\nThe normal force is given by:\n$$F_{n} = F_{z} = 2200 \\, \\text{N}$$\n\nNow we can compute the minimum required coefficient of friction, $\\mu_{\\text{req}}$, by taking the ratio at this instant:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{|\\mathbf{F}_{t}|}{F_{n}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3442500}}{2200}$$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can factor the terms:\n$$|\\mathbf{F}_{t}| = \\sqrt{(4 \\times 450)^{2} + (450)^{2}} = \\sqrt{16 \\times 450^{2} + 1 \\times 450^{2}} = \\sqrt{17 \\times 450^{2}} = 450\\sqrt{17}$$\nSo, the expression for $\\mu_{\\text{req}}$ becomes:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{450\\sqrt{17}}{2200} = \\frac{45\\sqrt{17}}{220} = \\frac{9\\sqrt{17}}{44}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round it to four significant figures as requested.\nUsing the value $\\sqrt{17} \\approx 4.1231056256$:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{req}} = \\frac{9 \\times 4.1231056256}{44} \\approx \\frac{37.1079506305}{44} \\approx 0.84336251433$$\n\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{req}} \\approx 0.8434$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity, as it is a ratio of two forces.",

Empirical observations of impact transients indicate practically relevant frequency content up to $300~\\mathrm{Hz}$. The chain will use an analog low-pass anti-aliasing filter followed by uniform sampling at rate $f_{s}$ by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The anti-aliasing filter is specified to be a fourth-order Butterworth low-pass filter. To ensure scientific interpretability of impact features while mitigating aliasing, the laboratory imposes two design constraints: (i) the filter magnitude in the passband up to $300~\\mathrm{Hz}$ must remain within $1\\%$ of unity (that is, amplitude $\\geq 0.99$ at $300~\\mathrm{Hz}$), and (ii) the filter must provide at least $40~\\mathrm{dB}$ attenuation at the Nyquist frequency $f_{s}/2$ (this attenuation serves as the aliasing margin for content above the passband). Using only fundamental principles (such as the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem and standard properties of a Butterworth low-pass filter), determine the smallest sampling rate $f_{s}$ and the corresponding filter cutoff frequency $f_{c}$ (the $-3~\\mathrm{dB}$ corner) that jointly satisfy these constraints.

The design is governed by two constraints: one on the passband magnitude and one on the stopband attenuation.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical model for the filter. The magnitude squared response, $|H(f)|^2$, of an $n$-th order Butterworth low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency $f_c$ (the frequency at which the magnitude is attenuated by $3~\\mathrm{dB}$) is given by:\n$$|H(f)|^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\left(\\frac{f}{f_c}\\right)^{2n}}$$\nFor this problem, the filter order is given as $n=4$.

Plantarflexion/dorsiflexion occurs about the $z$-axis. Ground Reaction Force (GRF) and Center of Pressure (COP) are measured from a force plate and mapped into the laboratory frame.

With a plantarflexion angular velocity $\\omega_z = +8 \\ \\text{rad/s}$:\n$$ P = (-12.8 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m})(+8 \\ \\text{rad/s}) = -102.4 \\ \\text{W} $$\nThis calculation confirms the problem's statement of observing approximately $-100 \\ \\text{W}$. This negative power indicates energy absorption, which is contrary to the expected energy generation (positive power) during the propulsive push-off phase of running.\n\nNext, we analyze the diagnostic check using the shoe insole data. The new COP is $x_c^{\\text{shoe}} = +0.08 \\ \\text{m}$.\nThe new position vector from the ankle to the COP is:\n$$ \\mathbf{r}^{\\text{shoe}} = (x_c^{\\text{shoe}} - x_a, y_c^{\\text{shoe}} - y_a, z_c^{\\text{shoe}} - z_a) = (0.08 - 0, 0 - 0.04, 0 - 0) = (0.08, -0.04, 0) \\ \\text{m} $$\nWe recompute the moment $M_z$ with this new COP:\n$$ M_z^{\\text{shoe}} = r_x^{\\text{shoe}} F_y - r_y^{\\text{shoe}} F_x $$\n$$ M_z^{\\text{shoe}} = (0.08 \\ \\text{m})(400 \\ \\text{N}) - (-0.04 \\ \\text{m})(-120 \\ \\text{N}) $$\n$$ M_z^{\\text{shoe}} = 32.0 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} - 4.8 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} = +27.2 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m} $$\nThis is a plantarflexor external moment.\nThe recomputed power is:\n$$ P^{\\text{shoe}} = M_z^{\\text{shoe}} \\, \\omega_z = (+27.2 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m})(+8 \\ \\text{rad/s}) = +217.6 \\ \\text{W} $$\nThis recomputation yields a large positive power, which is consistent with ankle push-off. This strongly suggests the initial COP data from the force plate was erroneous.\n\nNow we evaluate each option.\n\n**A. A posterior mislocation of the COP (negative $r_x$) at $t^\\*$ can flip the sign of the external moment $M_z$ and, given $\\omega_z  0$, produce non-physical negative ankle power; the shoe-insole remapping to anterior $x_c^{\\text{shoe}}$ is consistent with correcting this error.**\nOur analysis shows that the initial posterior COP ($r_x = -0.02 \\ \\text{m}$) resulted in a negative moment $M_z = -12.8 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$. With a positive angular velocity $\\omega_z  0$, this mathematically necessitates a negative power $P  0$. This is considered non-physical for push-off. The diagnostic remapping to an anterior COP ($x_c^{\\text{shoe}} = +0.08 \\ \\text{m}$, so $r_x^{\\text{shoe}} = +0.08 \\ \\text{m}$) resulted in a positive moment $M_z^{\\text{shoe}} = +27.2 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m}$ and a positive power $P^{\\text{shoe}} = +217.6 \\ \\text{W}$, which resolves the physical contradiction. The statement accurately describes the situation and the effect of the correction.\n_Verdict: Correct._\n\n**B. A vertical GRF baseline drift alone of magnitude $-300 \\ \\text{N}$ could plausibly invert the sign of $M_z$ at $t^\\*$ without COP mislocation, explaining the negative power.**\nLet's test this. Assume the initial COP ($r_x = -0.02 \\ \\text{m}$) is correct. We want to see if an error in $F_y$ could make $M_z  0$. The equation for the moment is $M_z = r_x F_y - r_y F_x = (-0.02) F_y - 4.8$. For $M_z$ to be positive:\n$$ (-0.02) F_y - 4.8  0 \\implies (-0.02) F_y  4.8 \\implies F_y  \\frac{4.8}{-0.02} \\implies F_y  -240 \\ \\text{N} $$\nThis would require the vertical ground reaction force to be negative (i.e., pulling the subject down), which is physically impossible. Therefore, no error in $F_y$ alone can make the moment positive. Furthermore, the problem states that GRF calibration showed vertical force offsets \"below $10 \\ \\text{N}$\", which makes a drift of $-300 \\ \\text{N}$ implausible and contradictory to the provided information.\n_Verdict: Incorrect._\n\n**C. A sign error in the sagittal angular velocity (recording plantarflexion $\\omega_z$ as negative) is the most likely cause of the negative joint power observed, even if the external moment $M_z$ is negative at $t^\\*$**\nIf there were a sign error and the true angular velocity was $\\omega_z = -8 \\ \\text{rad/s}$, the power would be $P = M_z \\omega_z = (-12.8 \\ \\text{N}\\cdot\\text{m})(-8 \\ \\text{rad/s}) = +102.4 \\ \\text{W}$. While this mathematically yields positive power, a negative angular velocity ($\\omega_z  0$) corresponds to dorsiflexion, according to the stated sign convention. Rapid dorsiflexion is the opposite of the explosive plantarflexion that characterizes ankle push-off. This explanation would resolve the sign of the power at the cost of making the underlying kinematics physically inconsistent with the described movement phase. The problem also states that the measurement of $\\omega_z  0$ is consistent with the observed increasing plantarflexion angle, making a sign error less likely. Given the plausible alternative of a COP error proven by the insole data, a sign error in kinematics is not the \"most likely cause.\"\n_Verdict: Incorrect._\n\n**D. The filtering mismatch between GRF and kinematics can introduce phase lags that cause brief intervals of negative instant power, but given the observed negative $M_z$ and a posterior COP, filtering alone cannot explain sustained negative power across push-off; the data suggest a spatial COP mapping issue rather than temporal phase error.**\nThis statement makes two points. First, that filtering mismatch (kinematics at $6 \\ \\text{Hz}$, GRF at $50 \\ \\text{Hz}$) can cause phase lags leading to transient negative power. This is a known artifact in biomechanics. Second, it argues that this is not the primary cause here. Our calculation showed that based on the given spatial configuration ($r_x  0$), the moment $M_z$ is structurally negative at time $t^\\*$. A temporal phase shift would alter the timing of the signals, but it wouldn't change the fact that the combination of a posterior COP and an upward/backward GRF results in a negative (dorsiflexor) external moment. The problem is not just a brief timing mismatch around a zero-crossing; it's a \"sustained\" issue ($40 \\ \\text{ms}$) rooted in a spatially incorrect calculation. The resolution of the problem by spatially remapping the COP with the insole strongly supports the conclusion that the issue is a spatial mapping error, not primarily a temporal one. The statement provides an accurate and nuanced assessment of the situation.\n_Verdict: Correct._",
