            "problem": "A tri-axial force platform uses four identical bending-beam load cells at its corners. Each load cell incorporates a full Wheatstone bridge constructed from four identical foil strain gauges, two experiencing axial tension and two experiencing axial compression under vertical loading of the platform. Assume that at a particular operating point the axial strain magnitude at the gauge locations is uniform and equal to $\\epsilon=500\\times 10^{-6}$ for the tensioned gauges and $-\\epsilon$ for the compressed gauges.

            "solution": "The objective is to derive the small-signal output voltage change at the nodes of a full Wheatstone bridge due to axial strain in the gauges and then evaluate it numerically. We proceed from first principles: the definition of gauge factor and the voltage division properties of the Wheatstone bridge.\n\nConsider four identical gauges with nominal resistance $R$. Under axial strain, the resistance changes as follows. The gauge factor is defined by\n$$\nGF \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta R/R}{\\epsilon},\n$$\nwhich implies\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta R}{R} = GF\\,\\epsilon.\n$$\nFor a gauge in tension (positive axial strain), the resistance increases to $R(1+\\delta)$, and for a gauge in compression (negative axial strain), the resistance decreases to $R(1-\\delta)$, where we introduce the dimensionless small parameter\n$$\n\\delta \\equiv \\frac{\\Delta R}{R} = GF\\,\\epsilon.\n$$\n\nIn a full bridge for axial loading, arrange the resistances such that the left leg consists of an upper resistor $R_{1}=R(1+\\delta)$ (tension) and a lower resistor $R_{2}=R(1-\\delta)$ (compression), while the right leg consists of an upper resistor $R_{3}=R(1-\\delta)$ (compression) and a lower resistor $R_{4}=R(1+\\delta)$ (tension). The bridge is excited at the top node by $V_{ex}$ and grounded at the bottom node. The left mid-node voltage $V_{L}$ (with respect to ground) is given by the voltage divider:\n$$\nV_{L} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}+R_{2}} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{R(1-\\delta)}{R(1+\\delta)+R(1-\\delta)} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{1-\\delta}{2}.\n$$\nSimilarly, the right mid-node voltage $V_{R}$ is\n$$\nV_{R} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{R_{4}}{R_{3}+R_{4}} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{R(1+\\delta)}{R(1-\\delta)+R(1+\\delta)} = V_{ex}\\,\\frac{1+\\delta}{2}.\n$$\nThe bridge output voltage is the difference between the mid-nodes:\n$$\nV_{out} = V_{L} - V_{R} = V_{ex}\\left(\\frac{1-\\delta}{2}-\\frac{1+\\delta}{2}\\right) = -\\,V_{ex}\\,\\delta.\n$$\nThus, the small-signal output is linear in the normalized resistance change $\\delta$ and the excitation voltage.

            "introduction": "Once a transducer produces an analog voltage, this continuous signal must be sampled and converted into a digital format for computer analysis. However, this critical step is fraught with a potential error known as aliasing, where high-frequency components can masquerade as lower-frequency signals, corrupting the data. This practice will challenge you to apply the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem to predict the aliased frequency of a known vibration and to propose a practical filtering strategy to ensure data fidelity. ",
            "id": "4174799",
            "problem": "A laboratory-grade piezoelectric force platform records the vertical ground reaction force during walking. The analog output of the transducer includes a narrowband vibration at frequency $f_{0} = 200$ Hz, excited by a structural resonance of the platform when the heel strikes the surface. This analog signal is digitized by an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) at sampling frequency $f_{s} = 300$ Hz. \n\nStarting from the definition of sampling as periodic replication of the continuous-time spectrum at integer multiples of the sampling frequency and the concept of the Nyquist frequency $f_{N} = f_{s}/2$, derive the frequency at which the $f_{0} = 200$ Hz component will appear (alias) in the discrete-time signal recorded by the force platform data acquisition system. In your derivation, reason from first principles about how sampled spectra fold into the baseband $[0, f_{N}]$ and determine the integer indexing of the spectral replicas that yields the observed aliased frequency. \n\nAdditionally, justify an analog Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF) design choice that mitigates the aliasing in this scenario while preserving biomechanically relevant content up to $50$ Hz. Your proposal should specify a low-pass cutoff frequency relative to $f_{N}$ and an order or slope rationale that achieves strong attenuation at $f_{0} = 200$ Hz, while maintaining near-unity gain in the passband up to $50$ Hz. The filter proposal is conceptual and does not require a numerical specification as the final answer.\n\nExpress the aliased frequency in Hz. No rounding is required; report the exact value.",
            "solution": "The process of sampling an analog signal $x(t)$ at a frequency $f_s$ can be modeled as multiplying the signal by an infinite train of Dirac delta functions separated by the sampling period $T_s = 1/f_s$. In the frequency domain, this corresponds to the convolution of the signal's spectrum, $X(f)$, with a train of delta functions at integer multiples of $f_s$. The resulting spectrum of the sampled signal, $X_s(f)$, is a periodic replication of the original spectrum:\n$$X_s(f) = f_s \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(f - k f_s)$$\nwhere $k$ is an integer index for the spectral replicas.\n\nThe Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) and subsequent digital processing can only represent frequencies within the baseband, which extends from $0$ to the Nyquist frequency, $f_N$. The Nyquist frequency is defined as half the sampling frequency:\n$$f_N = \\frac{f_s}{2}$$\nFor the given sampling frequency of $f_s = 300$ Hz, the Nyquist frequency is:\n$$f_N = \\frac{300 \\text{ Hz}}{2} = 150 \\text{ Hz}$$\nThe baseband of the recorded signal is therefore $[0, 150]$ Hz.\n\nThe problem states that a structural resonance introduces a vibration component at a frequency of $f_0 = 200$ Hz. Since $f_0 > f_N$, this frequency component lies outside the baseband and will be subject to aliasing. Aliasing is the phenomenon where a frequency component from one of the spectral replicas ($k \\neq 0$) \"folds\" or \"aliases\" into the baseband, appearing as a lower frequency that was not present in the original signal within that range.\n\nThe aliased frequency, $f_a$, is the apparent frequency in the baseband $[0, f_N]$ that corresponds to the original out-of-band frequency $f_0$. This frequency can be determined by finding the absolute difference between $f_0$ and the nearest integer multiple of the sampling frequency $f_s$. Mathematically, we seek an integer $k$ such that the aliased frequency $f_a = |f_0 - k f_s|$ falls within the range $[0, f_N]$.\n\nLet's evaluate this for the given values, $f_0 = 200$ Hz and $f_s = 300$ Hz:\n- For the replica indexed by $k=0$, the frequency is $|200 - 0 \\times 300| = 200$ Hz, which is outside the baseband $[0, 150]$ Hz. This is the original, unaliased component.\n- For the replica indexed by $k=1$, a component of the original spectrum at $f_0$ is shifted. The new frequency locations related to this replica are $f_s \\pm f_0$. The component that folds into the baseband is at a location $|f_0-f_s|$. The aliased frequency is calculated as $f_a = |200 - 1 \\times 300| = |-100| = 100$ Hz. This value, $100$ Hz, lies within the baseband $[0, 150]$ Hz.\n- For the replica indexed by $k=2$, the calculation is $|200 - 2 \\times 300| = |-400| = 400$ Hz, which is outside the baseband.\n\nThe integer index that yields the observed aliased frequency in the principal alias range is $k=1$. The spectral component from the replica centered at $f_s=300$ Hz, specifically the lower sideband component at $f_s - f_0$, manifests within the baseband. Thus, the narrowband vibration at $f_0 = 200$ Hz will appear as a spurious component at an aliased frequency of $f_a = 100$ Hz in the digitized force platform data.\n\nTo mitigate this aliasing, an analog Anti-Aliasing Filter (AAF) must be placed before the ADC. The filter's purpose is to attenuate frequencies above the Nyquist frequency ($150$ Hz) before they can be sampled and aliased. The design must also satisfy the constraint of preserving the biomechanically relevant signal content up to $50$ Hz.\n\nA suitable AAF would be an analog low-pass filter with the following characteristics:\n1.  **Cutoff Frequency, $f_c$**: The cutoff frequency must be positioned to create a flat passband for the signal of interest while providing attenuation at the aliasing frequency. It must be greater than the highest frequency of interest, $50$ Hz, but strictly less than the Nyquist frequency, $f_N = 150$ Hz, to be effective. A practical choice for $f_c$ (the $-3$ dB point) could be approximately $f_c \\approx 100$ Hz. This choice places the cutoff well above the preserved band ($[0, 50]$ Hz) to minimize amplitude and phase distortion of the relevant biomechanical signal, while still being significantly below $f_N$ and providing a transition band to attenuate higher frequencies.\n\n2.  **Order and Slope Rationale**: The steepness of the filter's attenuation characteristic (roll-off) is critical. A first-order filter provides a slow roll-off of $-20$ dB/decade, which would offer minimal attenuation at $f_0 = 200$ Hz, only one octave above a $100$ Hz cutoff. To achieve \"strong attenuation\" as required, a higher-order filter is necessary. For example, a fourth-order Butterworth filter provides a much steeper roll-off (approaching $-80$ dB/decade in the far stopband) and has the desirable property of a maximally flat passband, ensuring the fidelity of the signal components up to $50$ Hz. An even higher order, such as a sixth- or eighth-order filter, would provide a sharper transition from passband to stopband and greater attenuation of the $200$ Hz noise, further ensuring the integrity of the collected data. The choice of a higher-order filter (e.g., fourth-order or greater) is thus justified to effectively suppress the $200$ Hz resonant frequency and prevent it from corrupting the measurement in the $0-50$ Hz band of interest.",

As the subject's right foot is placed with its midline over the plate center, a displacement in the $+y$ direction (left) corresponds to a shift towards the medial side of the right foot.\n\nIn summary, the center of pressure is located anteriorly and medially on the plantar surface of the subject's right foot, relative to the foot's geometric center. This is a physiologically plausible result for a quiet standing posture.",
