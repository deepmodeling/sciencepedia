It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises. The task is a standard application of dimensional analysis to a fundamental physics problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the application of the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem to find a minimal set of independent nondimensional groups from the given physical quantities.\n\nThe number of variables is $n=5$. The variables are the volumetric flow rate $Q$, the pressure drop $\\Delta p$, the dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, the tube radius $R$, and the tube length $L$.\n\nWe first express the dimensions of each variable in a fundamental system of units, for instance, Mass ($M$), Length ($L$), and Time ($T$).\n1.  Volumetric flow rate, $Q$: $[Q] = \\frac{\\text{Volume}}{\\text{Time}} = \\frac{L^3}{T} = L^3 T^{-1}$.\n2.  Pressure drop, $\\Delta p$: $[\\Delta p] = \\frac{\\text{Force}}{\\text{Area}} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$.\n3.  Dynamic viscosity, $\\mu$: $[\\mu] = \\frac{\\text{Stress}}{\\text{Strain Rate}} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{T^{-1}} = M L^{-1} T^{-1}$.\n4.  Tube radius, $R$: $[R] = L$.\n5.  Tube length, $L$: $[L] = L$.\n\nThere are 3 fundamental dimensions ($M, L, T$). The rank of the dimensional matrix is $r=3$. According to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups ($\\Pi$ groups) is $k = n - r = 5 - 3 = 2$.\n\nWe seek to find two independent dimensionless groups, $\\Pi_1$ and $\\Pi_2$. Any dimensionless group $\\Pi$ can be written as a monomial product of the variables:\n$$ \\Pi = Q^{a_1} (\\Delta p)^{a_2} \\mu^{a_3} R^{a_4} L^{a_5} $$\nFor $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, the combined dimensions must be $M^0 L^0 T^0$.\n$$ [Q]^{a_1} [\\Delta p]^{a_2} [\\mu]^{a_3} [R]^{a_4} [L]^{a_5} = (L^3 T^{-1})^{a_1} (M L^{-1} T^{-2})^{a_2} (M L^{-1} T^{-1})^{a_3} (L)^{a_4} (L)^{a_5} = M^0 L^0 T^0 $$\nThis yields a system of linear equations for the exponents $a_i$ by summing the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n- For $M$: $a_2 + a_3 = 0$\n- For $L$: $3a_1 - a_2 - a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 0$\n- For $T$: $-a_1 - 2a_2 - a_3 = 0$\n\nWe solve this system of $3$ equations for $5$ unknowns. We can express three exponents in terms of two free variables. Let's choose $a_2$ and $a_5$ as the free variables.\nFrom the $M$ equation: $a_3 = -a_2$.\nSubstituting $a_3$ into the $T$ equation: $-a_1 - 2a_2 - (-a_2) = 0 \\implies -a_1 - a_2 = 0 \\implies a_1 = -a_2$.\nSubstituting $a_1$ and $a_3$ into the $L$ equation: $3(-a_2) - a_2 - (-a_2) + a_4 + a_5 = 0 \\implies -3a_2 + a_4 + a_5 = 0 \\implies a_4 = 3a_2 - a_5$.\n\nThe general solution for the exponent vector $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5)$ is $(-a_2, a_2, -a_2, 3a_2 - a_5, a_5)$.\nWe can find a basis for the solution space by choosing two linearly independent pairs for $(a_2, a_5)$.\n\n1.  Set $a_2 = 0$ and $a_5 = 1$. The exponent vector is $(0, 0, 0, -1, 1)$. This corresponds to the dimensionless group $\\Pi_A = Q^0 (\\Delta p)^0 \\mu^0 R^{-1} L^1 = \\frac{L}{R}$. This is a purely geometric group, representing the aspect ratio of the tube. The problem statement mentioned that end effects can be captured by such a parameter.\n\n2.  Set $a_2 = 1$ and $a_5 = 0$. The exponent vector is $(-1, 1, -1, 3, 0)$. This corresponds to the dimensionless group $\\Pi_B = Q^{-1} (\\Delta p)^1 \\mu^{-1} R^3 L^0 = \\frac{\\Delta p R^3}{\\mu Q}$.\n\nA basis for the set of dimensionless groups is thus $\\{\\frac{L}{R}, \\frac{\\Delta p R^3}{\\mu Q}\\}$. Any two independent combinations of these groups will also form a valid basis.\n\nThe problem imposes an additional constraint: one of the groups must explicitly contain $Q$ and tend to a constant in the asymptotic limit of a very long tube (where end effects are negligible). This physical regime ($L/R \\to \\infty$) is described by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ Q = \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta p}{8 \\mu L} $$\nWe need to construct a $\\Pi$ group using our basis that becomes constant according to this law. Let's form a group that is a product of powers of our basis groups, $\\Pi_A$ and $\\Pi_B$.\nConsider the group $\\Pi_1 = \\Pi_B^{-1} \\cdot \\Pi_A = \\left(\\frac{\\mu Q}{\\Delta p R^3}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{L}{R}\\right) = \\frac{\\mu Q L}{\\Delta p R^4}$. Let's see how this group behaves.\nSubstituting the Poiseuille equation into this expression:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = \\frac{\\mu L}{\\Delta p R^4} Q = \\frac{\\mu L}{\\Delta p R^4} \\left( \\frac{\\pi R^4 \\Delta p}{8 \\mu L} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{8} $$\nThis group, $\\Pi_1 = \\frac{Q \\mu L}{\\Delta p R^4}$, is indeed constant in the limit of long tubes where Poiseuille's law holds. It contains $Q$ as required. This will be our first dimensionless group.\n\nFor the second independent group, $\\Pi_2$, we need a group that is not a power or multiple of $\\Pi_1$. The most natural and simplest choice is the geometric group $\\Pi_A = \\frac{L}{R}$ derived earlier. This group also has a clear physical interpretation as the tube aspect ratio, which parameterizes the \"long tube\" limit ($L/R \\to \\infty$).\n\nThus, a minimal set of independent nondimensional groups satisfying all the problem's constraints is:\n$$ \\Pi_1 = \\frac{Q \\mu L}{\\Delta p R^4} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\Pi_2 = \\frac{L}{R} $$\nBoth are expressed in their simplest monomial form. The functional relationship governing the flow can be written as $\\Pi_1 = f(\\Pi_2)$, where for large $\\Pi_2$, $f(\\Pi_2) \\to \\frac{\\pi}{8}$.\n\nThe final answer requires these two groups to be presented in a row matrix.",

You are asked to assess this choice using dimensional analysis and the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem, and to derive the correct non-dimensional walking speed for dynamically similar gait across individuals of different leg length. Assume a characteristic leg length $L$, forward center-of-mass speed $U$, and gravitational acceleration $g$ govern the passive pendular dynamics of the stance phase.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It poses a valid question within the field of biomechanics, centered on the correct application of dimensional analysis and the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem. The premises are physically sound, and the task is to perform a rigorous derivation and critique, which is a standard procedure in physics and engineering. The problem is therefore deemed valid for solution.\n\nThe analysis begins from the principles of dimensional analysis, which state that any physically meaningful equation must be dimensionally homogeneous. The Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem provides a method for reformulating a given problem in terms of a smaller set of dimensionless parameters, constructed from the original physical variables.\n\nFirst, we identify the set of variables that describe steady walking speed governed by gravity and morphology. As stated, these are the forward speed of the center of mass, $U$, a characteristic leg length, $L$, and the acceleration due to gravity, $g$. We assign fundamental dimensions of Length ($L$) and Time ($T$) to each variable. Mass is not included as it cancels out in the simplified inverted pendulum model of walking ($ml^2\\ddot{\\theta} \\approx -mgl\\theta$, leading to $\\ddot{\\theta} + (g/l)\\theta \\approx 0$), making the dynamics independent of body mass at this level of analysis.\n\nThe variables and their dimensions are:\n- Speed $U$: $[U] = L T^{-1}$\n- Leg length $L$: $[L] = L$\n- Gravitational acceleration $g$: $[g] = L T^{-2}$\n\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups, $p$, that can be formed from a set of $n$ variables is given by $p = n - k$, where $k$ is the number of fundamental dimensions used to describe the variables. Here, we have $n=3$ variables ($U$, $L$, $g$) and $k=2$ fundamental dimensions ($L$, $T$). Therefore, we can construct $p = 3 - 2 = 1$ independent dimensionless group.\n\nLet this dimensionless group be denoted by $\\Pi$. We can write it as a product of the variables raised to some powers:\n$$\n\\Pi = U^a L^b g^c\n$$\nFor $\\Pi$ to be dimensionless, its dimensional representation must be $L^0 T^0$. We express the dimensions of $\\Pi$ in terms of the dimensions of the constituent variables:\n$$\n[\\Pi] = [U]^a [L]^b [g]^c = (L T^{-1})^a (L)^b (L T^{-2})^c = L^{a+b+c} T^{-a-2c}\n$$\nEquating the exponents of $L$ and $T$ to zero yields a system of two linear equations with three unknowns ($a$, $b$, $c$):\n1. For dimension $L$: $a + b + c = 0$\n2. For dimension $T$: $-a - 2c = 0$\n\nFrom equation (2), we find $a = -2c$. Substituting this into equation (1) gives:\n$$\n(-2c) + b + c = 0 \\implies b - c = 0 \\implies b = c\n$$\nWe have one degree of freedom, as expected for finding one dimensionless group. To construct the dimensionless group representing gait speed, we desire the exponent of $U$ to be non-zero. A conventional choice is to set $a=1$.\nIf $a=1$, then from $a = -2c$, we get $c = -1/2$.\nSince $b = c$, we also have $b = -1/2$.\nSubstituting these exponents back into the expression for $\\Pi$ gives:\n$$\n\\Pi = U^1 L^{-1/2} g^{-1/2} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL}}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Froude number, which represents the ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces. In the context of gait, it provides a dynamically sound basis for comparing the speed of animals with different leg lengths. According to the principle of dynamic similarity, two walking systems are dynamically similar if their Froude numbers are equal. Thus, $\\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL}}$ is the correct non-dimensional walking speed.\n\nNow, we assess the proposal to replace the geometric length scale $L$ with the kinematic quantity $L' = U^2/g$.\nFirst, let's verify the dimensions of $L'$.\n$$\n[L'] = \\frac{[U]^2}{[g]} = \\frac{(L T^{-1})^2}{L T^{-2}} = \\frac{L^2 T^{-2}}{L T^{-2}} = L\n$$\nThe quantity $L'$ indeed has dimensions of length. The flaw, however, arises when this quantity is used to non-dimensionalize the speed $U$ itself. The purpose of creating a dimensionless parameter is to relate a variable of interest (like $U$) to the independent physical scales of the system (like $L$ and $g$). The proposed quantity $L'$ is not an independent scale; it is constructed from the very variable, $U$, that one seeks to normalize.\n\nTo demonstrate this formally, let us attempt to construct a dimensionless speed using the variable set $\\{U, g, L'\\}$. Let this new dimensionless group be $\\Pi'$.\n$$\n\\Pi' = U^x g^y (L')^z\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $L' = U^2/g$:\n$$\n\\Pi' = U^x g^y \\left( \\frac{U^2}{g} \\right)^z = U^{x+2z} g^{y-z}\n$$\nFor $\\Pi'$ to be dimensionless, the exponents of the fundamental dimensions ($L$ and $T$) must be zero.\n$$\n[\\Pi'] = [U]^{x+2z} [g]^{y-z} = (L T^{-1})^{x+2z} (L T^{-2})^{y-z} = L^{(x+2z)+(y-z)} T^{-(x+2z)-2(y-z)}\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n1. For dimension $L$: $x + y + z = 0$\n2. For dimension $T$: $-(x+2z) - 2(y-z) = 0 \\implies -x - 2z - 2y + 2z = 0 \\implies -x - 2y = 0 \\implies x = -2y$\n\nSubstituting $x = -2y$ into the first equation:\n$$\n(-2y) + y + z = 0 \\implies -y + z = 0 \\implies y = z\n$$\nTo form a non-dimensional speed, we set the exponent of $U$ in the original formulation, $x$, to $1$. If $x=1$, then $y = -1/2$. Consequently, $z = -1/2$.\nThe dimensionless group is:\n$$\n\\Pi' = U^1 g^{-1/2} (L')^{-1/2} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL'}}\n$$\nNow, substituting the definition of $L'$ back into this expression:\n$$\n\\Pi' = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{g \\left( \\frac{U^2}{g} \\right)}} = \\frac{U}{\\sqrt{U^2}} = \\frac{U}{|U|}\n$$\nAssuming forward motion where $U > 0$, this yields:\n$$\n\\Pi' = 1\n$$\nThe result is a constant value of $1$. This is a tautological or degenerate normalization. It contains no information about the state of the system because the variable to be normalized ($U$) was used to define the scale of normalization ($L'$). Such a parameter cannot be used to compare different gaits or collapse experimental data, as it maps all possible walking speeds to the trivial value of $1$. This defeats the entire purpose of dimensional analysis, which is to find meaningful functional relationships between dimensionless parameters (e.g., $\\Pi_1 = f(\\Pi_2, \\Pi_3, ...)$). If the parameter itself is a constant, no such relationship can be established.\n\nTherefore, the correct non-dimensional representation of walking speed, which is non-tautological and grounded in the independent physical scales of the system, is the Froude number derived from the variables $U$, $g$, and the true morphological length scale $L$.\n\nThe problem mentions stride frequency $f$ (with dimension $[f]=T^{-1}$) as a potential additional variable. Including $f$ in the analysis with the set $\\{U, L, g, f\\}$ gives $n=4$ and $k=2$, resulting in $p=4-2=2$ dimensionless groups. One is the Froude number $\\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL}}$. The second can be found as $\\Pi_2 = f^a L^b g^c$. A common form is the Strouhal number, $\\Pi_2 = f \\sqrt{L/g}$, which is also a valid dimensionless parameter. A complete description of walking dynamics would then take the functional form $\\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL}} = \\phi\\left(f\\sqrt{\\frac{L}{g}}\\right)$. This underscores that the dimensionless speed $\\frac{U}{\\sqrt{gL}}$ is the quantity to be studied as a function of other dimensionless parameters, not a quantity to be trivially set to $1$.\n\nThe final answer requested is the corrected closed-form analytic expression for the non-dimensional walking speed. This is the Froude number.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem involves $n=7$ variables: $P, t, \\delta_0, H, R, E_0, \\mu$.\nThe fundamental dimensions are Mass (M), Length (L), and Time (T), so the rank of the dimensional matrix is $r=3$.\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups ($\\Pi$ groups) is $k = n-r = 7-3 = 4$.\n\n**1) Derivation for Set A: Repeating variables $\\{E_0, R, \\mu\\}$**\n\nThe repeating variables are $E_0$ ($[\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}]$), $R$ ($[\\text{L}]$), and $\\mu$ ($[\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-1}]$). These are dimensionally independent. The non-repeating variables are $P, t, \\delta_0, H$. We form a $\\Pi$ group for each.\n\n-   **Dimensionless Force $\\Pi_P^{(A)}$**:\n    $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = P \\cdot E_0^a R^b \\mu^c$\n    $[\\text{M}^0\\text{L}^0\\text{T}^0] = [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}] \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}]^a \\cdot [\\text{L}]^b \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-1}]^c$\n    Equating exponents for M, L, T:\n    M: $1 + a + c = 0$\n    L: $1 - a + b - c = 0$\n    T: $-2 - 2a - c = 0$\n    From M and T, we solve for $a$ and $c$: $c = -1-a \\implies -2 - 2a - (-1-a) = 0 \\implies -1 - a = 0 \\implies a = -1$. Then $c = -1 - (-1) = 0$.\n    Substitute into L: $1 - (-1) + b - 0 = 0 \\implies 2 + b = 0 \\implies b = -2$.\n    So, $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = P E_0^{-1} R^{-2} \\mu^0 = \\frac{P}{E_0 R^2}$.\n\n-   **Dimensionless Time $\\Pi_t^{(A)}$**:\n    $\\Pi_t^{(A)} = t \\cdot E_0^a R^b \\mu^c$\n    $[\\text{M}^0\\text{L}^0\\text{T}^0] = [\\text{T}] \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}]^a \\cdot [\\text{L}]^b \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-1}]^c$\n    M: $a+c=0$\n    L: $-a+b-c=0$\n    T: $1-2a-c=0$\n    From M and T: $c=-a \\implies 1-2a-(-a)=0 \\implies 1-a=0 \\implies a=1$. Then $c=-1$.\n    Substitute into L: $-1+b-(-1) = 0 \\implies b=0$.\n    So, $\\Pi_t^{(A)} = t E_0^1 R^0 \\mu^{-1} = \\frac{E_0 t}{\\mu}$.\n\n-   **Dimensionless Displacement (Strain) $\\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(A)}$**:\n    This group is formed with $\\delta_0$, which has dimension $[\\text{L}]$. We need to find $a, b, c$ for $\\delta_0 \\cdot E_0^a R^b \\mu^c$. The result must be dimensionless. The variable $R$ also has dimension $[\\text{L}]$. A simple combination is $\\delta_0/R$. Let's verify this fits the general procedure.\n    $[\\text{M}^0\\text{L}^0\\text{T}^0] = [\\text{L}] \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}]^a \\cdot [\\text{L}]^b \\cdot [\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-1}]^c$\n    M: $a+c=0 \\implies c=-a$.\n    T: $-2a-c=0 \\implies -2a-(-a)=0 \\implies a=0$. So $c=0$.\n    L: $1 - a + b - c = 0 \\implies 1 - 0 + b - 0 = 0 \\implies b=-1$.\n    So, $\\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(A)} = \\delta_0 E_0^0 R^{-1} \\mu^0 = \\frac{\\delta_0}{R}$.\n\n-   **Dimensionless Geometry $\\Pi_g^{(A)}$**:\n    This group is formed with $H$, which also has dimension $[\\text{L}]$. The derivation is identical to the one for $\\delta_0$.\n    So, $\\Pi_g^{(A)} = \\frac{H}{R}$.\n\nA complete set of dimensionless groups for Set A is:\n$\\{\\Pi_P^{(A)}, \\Pi_t^{(A)}, \\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(A)}, \\Pi_g^{(A)}\\} = \\left\\{ \\frac{P}{E_0 R^2}, \\frac{E_0 t}{\\mu}, \\frac{\\delta_0}{R}, \\frac{H}{R} \\right\\}$.\n\n**2) Derivation for Set B: Repeating variables $\\{E_0, H, \\mu\\}$**\n\nThe repeating variables are $E_0$ ($[\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-2}]$), $H$ ($[\\text{L}]$), and $\\mu$ ($[\\text{M}\\,\\text{L}^{-1}\\,\\text{T}^{-1}]$). The non-repeating variables are $P, t, \\delta_0, R$. The procedure is identical to Set A, with $H$ replacing $R$ as the repeating length scale.\n\n-   $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = \\frac{P}{E_0 H^2}$ (by replacing $R$ with $H$ in $\\Pi_P^{(A)}$'s derivation).\n-   $\\Pi_t^{(B)} = \\frac{E_0 t}{\\mu}$ (this group does not depend on the choice of length scale).\n-   $\\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(B)} = \\frac{\\delta_0}{H}$ (by replacing $R$ with $H$ in $\\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(A)}$'s derivation). This represents the axial engineering strain.\n-   $\\Pi_g^{(B)} = \\frac{R}{H}$ (this group is formed from the non-repeating variable $R$).\n\nA complete set of dimensionless groups for Set B is:\n$\\{\\Pi_P^{(B)}, \\Pi_t^{(B)}, \\Pi_\\varepsilon^{(B)}, \\Pi_g^{(B)}\\} = \\left\\{ \\frac{P}{E_0 H^2}, \\frac{E_0 t}{\\mu}, \\frac{\\delta_0}{H}, \\frac{R}{H} \\right\\}$.\n\n**3) Data Analysis and Comparison**\n\nThe problem provides physical guidance: (v) stress $\\sigma$ scales with $E_0$ and strain $\\epsilon$, and (vi) force $P$ scales with stress $\\sigma$ and cross-sectional area $A$. The natural definition of strain is $\\epsilon \\sim \\delta_0/H$, and the area is $A \\sim R^2$.\nCombining these gives a physical scaling law for the force:\n$P \\sim \\sigma A \\sim (E_0 \\epsilon) A \\sim E_0 \\left(\\frac{\\delta_0}{H}\\right) R^2$.\nThis implies that the dimensionless group $\\frac{P H}{E_0 \\delta_0 R^2}$ should be a function of the other dimensionless parameters, primarily dimensionless time $\\Pi_t = E_0 t/\\mu$.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of $\\Pi_P^{(A)}$ and $\\Pi_P^{(B)}$ based on this physical scaling:\n-   For Set A: $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = \\frac{P}{E_0 R^2}$. Using the scaling law, $\\Pi_P^{(A)} \\sim \\frac{E_0 (\\delta_0/H) R^2}{E_0 R^2} = \\frac{\\delta_0}{H}$.\n-   For Set B: $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = \\frac{P}{E_0 H^2}$. Using the scaling law, $\\Pi_P^{(B)} \\sim \\frac{E_0 (\\delta_0/H) R^2}{E_0 H^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\delta_0}{H}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R}{H}\\right)^2$.\n\nNow we examine the parameters of the three tests. For all tests, $E_0 t/\\mu = 1$.\n-   Test A: $\\delta_0/H = 0.3/3 = 0.1$, $R/H = 6/3 = 2$.\n-   Test B: $\\delta_0/H = 0.4/4 = 0.1$, $R/H = 4/4 = 1$.\n-   Test C: $\\delta_0/H = 0.2/2 = 0.1$, $R/H = 8/2 = 4$.\n\nCrucially, the axial strain $\\delta_0/H$ is constant ($0.1$) across all tests, while the aspect ratio $R/H$ varies.\n-   Since $\\Pi_P^{(A)} \\propto \\delta_0/H$, and $\\delta_0/H$ is constant, we predict that the values of $\\Pi_P^{(A)}$ should be constant across the tests, leading to perfect data collapse.\n-   Since $\\Pi_P^{(B)} \\propto (\\delta_0/H)(R/H)^2$, and $\\delta_0/H$ is constant but $R/H$ varies, we predict that the values of $\\Pi_P^{(B)}$ will vary as $(R/H)^2$ and the data will not collapse.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nLet's compute the values. We use SI units for consistency (meters, Pascals).\n$E_0$ is in Pa, $P$ is in N, and $R, H$ are in m.\n\n**Set A: $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = P / (E_0 R^2)$**\n-   Test A: $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = \\frac{0.036}{ (20 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (6 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.036}{ (20 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (36 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.036}{0.72} = 0.05$.\n-   Test B: $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = \\frac{0.024}{ (30 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (4 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.024}{ (30 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (16 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.024}{0.48} = 0.05$.\n-   Test C: $\\Pi_P^{(A)} = \\frac{0.048}{ (15 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.048}{ (15 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (64 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.048}{0.96} = 0.05$.\nThe values for Set A are $\\{0.05, 0.05, 0.05\\}$.\n-   Mean $\\mu_A = 0.05$.\n-   Standard deviation $\\sigma_A = 0$.\n-   Coefficient of Variation $\\text{CV}_A = \\sigma_A/\\mu_A = 0$.\n\n**Set B: $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = P / (E_0 H^2)$**\n-   Test A: $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = \\frac{0.036}{ (20 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (3 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.036}{ (20 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (9 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.036}{0.18} = 0.2$.\n-   Test B: $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = \\frac{0.024}{ (30 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (4 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.024}{ (30 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (16 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.024}{0.48} = 0.05$.\n-   Test C: $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = \\frac{0.048}{ (15 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (2 \\times 10^{-3})^2 } = \\frac{0.048}{ (15 \\times 10^3) \\cdot (4 \\times 10^{-6}) } = \\frac{0.048}{0.06} = 0.8$.\nThe values for Set B are $\\{0.2, 0.05, 0.8\\}$.\n-   Mean $\\mu_B = \\frac{0.2 + 0.05 + 0.8}{3} = \\frac{1.05}{3} = 0.35$.\n-   Population Variance $\\sigma_B^2 = \\frac{1}{3} [ (0.2-0.35)^2 + (0.05-0.35)^2 + (0.8-0.35)^2 ] = \\frac{1}{3} [(-0.15)^2 + (-0.30)^2 + (0.45)^2] = \\frac{1}{3}[0.0225 + 0.09 + 0.2025] = \\frac{0.315}{3} = 0.105$.\n-   Standard Deviation $\\sigma_B = \\sqrt{0.105} \\approx 0.324$.\n-   Coefficient of Variation $\\text{CV}_B = \\sigma_B/\\mu_B \\approx 0.324 / 0.35 \\approx 0.9258$. This is approximately $0.93$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nSet A, which uses the sample radius $R$ as the characteristic length for normalizing force, results in a perfect collapse of the experimental data ($\\text{CV}_A = 0$). Set B, which uses the sample thickness $H$, results in a large spread in the dimensionless force ($\\text{CV}_B \\approx 0.93$). The reason is that the physical scaling of the force $P$ involves the cross-sectional area ($\\sim R^2$), not the thickness squared ($H^2$). Using $H$ to normalize the force in $\\Pi_P^{(B)}$ fails to account for the geometry of the load-bearing area and introduces an artificial dependence on the aspect ratio squared, $(R/H)^2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n-   **A. Set A collapses the data with $\\text{CV} \\approx 0$, while Set B exhibits large spread with $\\text{CV} \\approx 0.93$, because using $H$ to scale $P$ injects aspect-ratio dependence via $(R/H)^2$.**\n    -   Our calculations show $\\text{CV}_A = 0$ and $\\text{CV}_B \\approx 0.93$. This part is correct.\n    -   Our analysis shows that $\\Pi_P^{(B)} = P/(E_0 H^2)$ is proportional to $(R/H)^2$ for a fixed applied strain $\\delta_0/H$. Using $H$ to scale $P$ in this manner injects the aspect-ratio dependence. This reasoning is correct.\n    -   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n-   **B. Set B collapses the data with $\\text{CV} \\approx 0$, while Set A exhibits large spread with $\\text{CV} \\approx 0.93$, because using $R$ to scale $P$ injects geometry dependence via $(H/R)^2$.**\n    -   This is the opposite of the calculated results.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **C. Both Set A and Set B collapse the data equally well with $\\text{CV} \\approx 0$, because only the viscoelastic time scale matters and geometry cancels out of the force scaling.**\n    -   Our calculations show that Set B does not collapse the data. The geometry does not cancel out; it is fundamental to how the force is generated.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n-   **D. Neither Set A nor Set B collapses the data; to obtain any collapse one must include mass density and inertia, so both $\\text{CV}$ values remain large and comparable.**\n    -   Our calculations show Set A collapses the data perfectly.\n    -   The problem statement explicitly states to neglect inertia, so including mass density is contrary to the problem's premises.\n    -   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
