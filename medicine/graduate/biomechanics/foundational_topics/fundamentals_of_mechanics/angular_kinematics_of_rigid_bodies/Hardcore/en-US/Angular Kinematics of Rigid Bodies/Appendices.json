            "problem": "A human knee joint is modeled as a revolute joint linking a proximal thigh segment and a distal shank segment. The Laboratory coordinate system (LAB) has orthonormal basis vectors fixed in space. The thigh segment carries a local orthonormal frame, denoted by $T$, and the shank segment carries a local orthonormal frame, denoted by $S$. At a particular instant of a dynamic trial, the orientations of these segment frames relative to LAB are pure rotations about the LAB $z$-axis:\n- The thigh frame $T$ is rotated by $30^{\\circ}$ about the LAB $z$-axis.\n- The shank frame $S$ is rotated by $75^{\\circ}$ about the LAB $z$-axis.\n\nThe angular velocity of a rigid body is a vector quantity that is independent of frame, but its coordinate representation depends on the choice of basis. At the instant considered, motion capture estimates provide the following angular velocity vectors for the segments, each expressed in its own local frame coordinates:\n- Thigh angular velocity expressed in $T$: $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.10 \\\\ 1.20 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix}$ in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n- Shank angular velocity expressed in $S$: $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}^{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.20 \\\\ 1.80 \\\\ 0.04 \\end{pmatrix}$ in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe knee flexion–extension axis is aligned with the $y$-axis of the thigh frame $T$, so the scalar knee flexion–extension rate is the projection of the relative angular velocity of the shank with respect to the thigh onto the $T$-frame $y$-axis.\n\nA common but erroneous practice is to subtract the $y$-components of $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}^{S}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^{T}$ directly, despite these components being expressed in different frames. This mixing of frames yields an incorrect joint rate estimate.\n\nUsing fundamental principles of rigid body kinematics and expressing all angular velocity vectors in a single, consistent frame before subtraction, determine the corrected scalar knee flexion–extension angular velocity at this instant. Round your final result to four significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{rad/s}$.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem is to compute the relative angular velocity between the shank and the thigh, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S/T}$, and then find its component along the knee flexion–extension axis, which is aligned with the $y$-axis of the thigh frame, $T$. The fundamental equation for relative angular velocity is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S/T} = \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S} - \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}\n$$\nHere, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}$ are the absolute angular velocities of the shank and thigh. A critical principle is that vector subtraction requires both vectors to be expressed in the same coordinate system. We choose to work in the thigh frame, $T$. The knee flexion-extension rate, $\\omega_{flex/ext}$, is the y-component of the relative angular velocity expressed in frame $T$:\n$$\n\\omega_{flex/ext} = (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S/T}^T)_y = (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}^T - \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^T)_y = (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}^T)_y - (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^T)_y\n$$\nWe are given the angular velocity of the thigh expressed in its own frame, $T$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.10 \\\\ 1.20 \\\\ 0.05 \\end{pmatrix} \\, \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nFrom this, we directly have $(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{T}^T)_y = 1.20 \\, \\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe main task is to determine $(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_{S}^T)_y$.

Extracting the Axis $\\mathbf{u}$**\nTo find the axis $\\mathbf{u}$, we can isolate the skew-symmetric part of $R$.\n$$\nR - R^T = (I + \\sin(\\theta) [\\mathbf{u}]_\\times + \\dots) - (I^T + \\sin(\\theta) [\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^T + \\dots)\n$$\nSince $I^T = I$ and $[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^T = -[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times$, and $([\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^2)^T = ([\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^T)^2 = (-[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times)^2 = [\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^2$ (symmetric), we get:\n$$\nR - R^T = 2\\sin(\\theta) [\\mathbf{u}]_\\times = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -u_z & u_y \\\\ u_z & 0 & -u_x \\\\ -u_y & u_x & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis allows us to extract the components of $\\mathbf{u}$ if $\\sin(\\theta) \\neq 0$:\n$$\nu_x = \\frac{R_{32} - R_{23}}{2\\sin(\\theta)}, \\quad u_y = \\frac{R_{13} - R_{31}}{2\\sin(\\theta)}, \\quad u_z = \\frac{R_{21} - R_{12}}{2\\sin(\\theta)}\n$$\n\n**3.3. Numerical Stability Considerations**\nThe above formulas become numerically unstable in two regimes:\n- **$\\theta \\approx 0$**: $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx 0$ and $R \\approx I$. The axis is ill-defined, and the formula for $\\mathbf{u}$ involves a $0/0$ indetermination.\n- **$\\theta \\approx \\pi$**: $\\sin(\\theta) \\approx 0$. Again, the formula for $\\mathbf{u}$ is unstable. This is the case for the given problem.\n\nFor the case where $\\theta \\approx \\pi$, we must use a more stable method. When $\\theta=\\pi$, we have $\\sin(\\pi)=0$ and $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$. Rodrigues' formula simplifies to:\n$$\nR = I + (1 - (-1))[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^2 = I + 2[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^2\n$$\nSubstituting $[\\mathbf{u}]_\\times^2 = \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T - I$:\n$$\nR = I + 2(\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T - I) = 2\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T - I\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T = \\frac{1}{2}(R + I)\n$$\nThe components of $\\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{u}^T$ are $u_i u_j$. The diagonal elements give the squares of the axis components:\n$$\nu_x^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{11} + 1), \\quad u_y^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{22} + 1), \\quad u_z^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(R_{33} + 1)\n$$\nThis allows us to find the magnitudes $|u_x|, |u_y|, |u_z|$. The relative signs can be determined from the off-diagonal elements, e.g., $u_x u_y = \\frac{1}{2}R_{12}$ (at exactly $\\theta=\\pi$, $R$ is symmetric, so $R_{12}=R_{21}$). When $\\theta$ is only close to $\\pi$, $R$ is nearly symmetric, and a robust method is to find the component with the largest magnitude (e.g., from the largest diagonal element of $R$), determine its value, and then find the other components and their signs using the off-diagonal terms like $u_i u_j = \\frac{1}{4}(R_{ij} + R_{ji})$. An alternative is to use the anti-symmetric part of $R$, which though small, cleanly provides the ratios of the axis components. Let $\\mathbf{v} = [R_{32}-R_{23}, R_{13}-R_{31}, R_{21}-R_{12}]^T$. Then $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{v}/|\\mathbf{v}|$. This method is effective if the matrix data is sufficiently precise.\n\n### Numerical Computation\n\nGiven the matrix:\n$$\nR \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-0.7777773333 & 0.4437776666 & 0.4451110000 \\\\\n\\;\\;0.4451110000 & -0.1111108333 & 0.8885553334 \\\\\n\\;\\;0.4437776666 & 0.8892220000 & -0.1111108333\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**4.1. Compute Angle $\\theta$**\nFirst, calculate the trace of $R$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(R) = -0.7777773333 - 0.1111108333 - 0.1111108333 = -0.9999990000\n$$\nNow, compute $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{-0.9999990000 - 1}{2} = \\frac{-1.9999990000}{2} = -0.9999995000\n$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is:\n$$\n\\theta = \\arccos(-0.9999995000) = 3.1405926538... \\text{ rad}\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures, we get $\\theta = 3.14059$ radians.\n\n**4.2. Compute Axis $\\mathbf{u}$**\nAs established, $\\theta \\approx \\pi$, so we must use a stable method. We compute the components of the vector proportional to $\\mathbf{u}$ from the anti-symmetric part of $R$:\n$$\nR_{32} - R_{23} = 0.8892220000 - 0.8885553334 = 0.0006666666\n$$\n$$\nR_{13} - R_{31} = 0.4451110000 - 0.4437776666 = 0.0013333334\n$$\n$$\nR_{21} - R_{12} = 0.4451110000 - 0.4437776666 = 0.0013333334\n$$\nLet $\\mathbf{v} = [0.0006666666, 0.0013333334, 0.0013333334]^T$. The ratios of the components suggest the axis vector is proportional to $[1, 2, 2]^T$. To find the unit vector $\\mathbf{u}$, we normalize this vector:\n$$\n|\\,[1, 2, 2]\\,| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 2^2} = \\sqrt{1+4+4} = \\sqrt{9} = 3\n$$\nSo, the two possible axes are $\\mathbf{u}_a = [1/3, 2/3, 2/3]^T$ and $\\mathbf{u}_b = [-1/3, -2/3, -2/3]^T$.\nThe problem specifies the constraint $u_z > 0$, which uniquely selects $\\mathbf{u}_a$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\\\ 2/3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.333333... \\\\ 0.666666... \\\\ 0.666666... \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nRounding the components to six significant figures:\n$u_x = 0.333333$\n$u_y = 0.666667$\n$u_z = 0.666667$\n\n### Final Answer Compilation\n\nThe calculated axis components and angle, rounded to six significant figures, are:\n- $u_x = 0.333333$\n- $u_y = 0.666667$\n- $u_z = 0.666667$\n- $\\theta = 3.14059$ rad\n\nThese are presented as a single row vector as requested.",
