            "problem": "A subject performs an isometric knee extension against a dynamometer that imposes a net external flexion moment of $50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ about the tibiofemoral joint axis at a fixed knee posture. At this posture, the patellar tendon acts on the tibia with a perpendicular moment arm of $0.04 \\, \\mathrm{m}$ relative to the joint axis. The patella is modeled as an ideal, frictionless pulley so that the quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon magnitudes are equal, that is, the quadriceps tendon–patellar tendon force ratio is $1$.

Angles are in degrees.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary data and assumptions to solve for the requested quantities using the principles of static equilibrium in biomechanics. The model, while simplified, is a standard and appropriate representation for this type of analysis.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts, corresponding to the two quantities requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the quadriceps muscle-tendon force ($F_Q$).\n\nThis quantity is determined from the rotational equilibrium of the tibia about the tibiofemoral joint axis. The condition for static equilibrium requires that the sum of all moments about any point is zero. We choose the joint axis of rotation as our point of summation.\n\n$$\n\\sum M_{joint} = 0\n$$\n\nThe forces creating moments about this axis are the patellar tendon force and the external force from the dynamometer. Forces that pass through the axis of rotation, such as the tibiofemoral joint reaction force, produce no moment and are thus excluded from this equation. The weight of the leg is neglected as per the problem statement.\n\nThe dynamometer imposes a net external flexion moment, which we can denote as $M_{ext}$. The problem gives its magnitude as $M_{ext} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$. By convention, we can consider flexion moments (which would rotate the tibia clockwise from an anterior view) as negative and extension moments (counter-clockwise) as positive.\n\nThe quadriceps contraction results in a force exerted by the patellar tendon on the tibia, $F_{PT}$. This force acts with a perpendicular moment arm, $d_{PT}$, relative to the joint axis. This creates an extension moment, $M_{PT}$, that counteracts the external flexion moment.\n\n$$\nM_{PT} = F_{PT} \\times d_{PT}\n$$\n\nThe equilibrium equation is:\n\n$$\n\\sum M_{joint} = M_{PT} - M_{ext} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nF_{PT} \\times d_{PT} - M_{ext} = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for the magnitude of the patellar tendon force, $F_{PT}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PT} = \\frac{M_{ext}}{d_{PT}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, $M_{ext} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ and $d_{PT} = 0.04 \\, \\mathrm{m}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PT} = \\frac{50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{0.04 \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the patella is modeled as an ideal, frictionless pulley, which implies that the tension is transmitted equally along the tendon system. Therefore, the magnitude of the quadriceps tendon force, $F_Q$, is equal to the magnitude of the patellar tendon force, $F_{PT}$.\n\n$$\nF_Q = F_{PT} = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. To express $1250$ with four significant figures, we write it as $1.250 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{N}$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the patellofemoral (PF) joint reaction force ($F_{PF}$).\n\nThis quantity is determined from the translational equilibrium of the patella. A free-body diagram of the patella includes three forces: the quadriceps tendon force ($\\vec{F}_Q$), the patellar tendon force ($\\vec{F}_{PT}$), and the compressive patellofemoral joint reaction force ($\\vec{F}_{PF}$) exerted by the femur onto the patella.\n\nFor static equilibrium, the vector sum of these forces must be zero:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT} + \\vec{F}_{PF} = \\vec{0}\n$$\n\nThis means the joint reaction force must perfectly balance the resultant of the two tendon forces:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{PF} = -(\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT})\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the joint reaction force, $F_{PF}$, is therefore equal to the magnitude of the resultant of $\\vec{F}_Q$ and $\\vec{F}_{PT}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = |\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT}|\n$$\n\nWe are given that the magnitudes are equal, $| \\vec{F}_Q | = | \\vec{F}_{PT} | = F_Q = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}$, and the angle between their lines of action is $\\theta = 20^\\circ$.\n\nThe magnitude of the sum of two vectors of equal magnitude $F$ with an angle $\\theta$ between them can be found using vector components. By orienting a coordinate system such that the x-axis bisects the angle $\\theta$, the two tendon forces are at angles $+\\theta/2$ and $-\\theta/2$ relative to the x-axis. The sum of the force components along this axis is:\n\n$$\n(|\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT}|)_x = F_Q \\cos(\\theta/2) + F_{PT} \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nThe components perpendicular to this axis cancel each other out. Since $F_Q = F_{PT}$, the magnitude of the resultant is:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2 F_Q \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nWe substitute the known values: $F_Q = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}$ and $\\theta = 20^\\circ$, which gives $\\theta/2 = 10^\\circ$.\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2 \\times 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\times \\cos(10^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2500 \\cos(10^\\circ) \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} \\approx 2500 \\times 0.984807753... \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n$$\nF_{PF} \\approx 2462.01938... \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2462 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe two requested values are the quadriceps muscle-tendon force, $F_Q = 1.250 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{N}$, and the magnitude of the patellofemoral joint reaction force, $F_{PF} = 2462 \\, \\mathrm{N}$.",

            "problem": "A forearm–hand segment is held static in the horizontal position with the elbow flexed at $90^{\\circ}$. A distal load of magnitude $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{N}$ acts vertically downward at the hand, located a distance $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$ from the elbow joint center.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information and first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe will analyze a free-body diagram of the forearm-hand segment. Let the elbow joint be the origin of a coordinate system $(0,0)$. The forearm axis lies along the x-axis, with positive $x$ pointing proximally (to the right, toward the shoulder). The y-axis is vertical, with positive $y$ pointing upward. The system is in static equilibrium, so the net force and net torque must be zero.\n\nThe forces acting on the segment are:\n1.  The external load $\\vec{W}$, acting at $x = -L$. $\\vec{W} = (0, -W)$.\n2.  The biceps force $\\vec{F}_b$. It acts at an angle $\\phi_b$ above the positive x-axis. $\\vec{F}_b = (F_b \\cos\\phi_b, F_b \\sin\\phi_b)$.\n3.  The triceps force $\\vec{F}_t$. It acts at an angle $\\phi_t$ below the positive x-axis. $\\vec{F}_t = (F_t \\cos\\phi_t, -F_t \\sin\\phi_t)$.\n4.  The joint reaction force $\\vec{J} = (J_x, J_y)$, exerted by the humerus on the ulna/radius at the elbow joint $(0,0)$.\n\nThe conditions for static equilibrium are:\n1.  Sum of torques about the elbow joint is zero: $\\sum \\tau_O = 0$.\n2.  Sum of forces in the x-direction is zero: $\\sum F_x = 0$.\n3.  Sum of forces in the y-direction is zero: $\\sum F_y = 0$.\n\n**1. Torque Equilibrium**\nWe sum the torques about the elbow joint $(O)$. Counter-clockwise torques are positive. The problem provides the moment arms $r_b$ and $r_t$, which are the perpendicular distances from the joint center to the muscle lines of action.\n- Torque from biceps (flexor): $\\tau_b = +F_b r_b$\n- Torque from triceps (extensor): $\\tau_t = -F_t r_t$\n- Torque from external load: $\\tau_W = -W L$\n- The joint reaction force $\\vec{J}$ produces zero torque about $O$.\n\nThe torque equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum \\tau_O = F_b r_b - F_t r_t - W L = 0 $$\nGiven $F_t = \\alpha F_b$ with $\\alpha = 0.25$:\n$$ F_b r_b - (\\alpha F_b) r_t - W L = 0 $$\n$$ F_b (r_b - \\alpha r_t) = W L $$\nSolving for $F_b$:\n$$ F_b = \\frac{W L}{r_b - \\alpha r_t} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n- $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n- $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_b = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.25$\n$$ F_b = \\frac{(80\\,\\mathrm{N})(0.30\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{m} - (0.25)(0.02\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 960\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe required biceps force is $F_b = 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nThe triceps force is $F_t = 0.25 \\times F_b = 0.25 \\times 960\\,\\mathrm{N} = 240\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**2. Force Equilibrium and Joint Reaction Forces**\nThe sum of all force vectors must be zero: $\\vec{F}_b + \\vec{F}_t + \\vec{W} + \\vec{J} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n**x-component (horizontal):**\n$$ \\sum F_x = F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t + J_x = 0 $$\n$$ J_x = -(F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t) $$\nThe term $F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t$ represents the total force pulling the forearm proximally into the joint. The compressive force $R_x$ is the magnitude of this interaction. Per the problem's definition ($R_x$ is positive for compression), $R_x$ is the reaction to $J_x$:\n$$ R_x = -J_x = F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ R_x = (960\\,\\mathrm{N})\\cos(15^{\\circ}) + (240\\,\\mathrm{N})\\cos(10^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R_x \\approx (960)(0.9659) + (240)(0.9848) \\approx 927.28\\,\\mathrm{N} + 236.35\\,\\mathrm{N} \\approx 1163.63\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nSo, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$. This is the compressive force on the joint.\n\n**y-component (vertical):**\n$$ \\sum F_y = F_b \\sin\\phi_b - F_t \\sin\\phi_t - W + J_y = 0 $$\nThe shear force $R_y$ is defined as the upward component, which corresponds to $J_y$:\n$$ R_y = J_y = W + F_t \\sin\\phi_t - F_b \\sin\\phi_b $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ R_y = 80\\,\\mathrm{N} + (240\\,\\mathrm{N})\\sin(10^{\\circ}) - (960\\,\\mathrm{N})\\sin(15^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R_y \\approx 80 + (240)(0.1736) - (960)(0.2588) \\approx 80 + 41.68\\,\\mathrm{N} - 248.45\\,\\mathrm{N} \\approx -126.77\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nSo, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$. The negative sign indicates the net shear force on the forearm at the joint is directed downward.\n\n**3. Effective Mechanical Advantage (EMA)**\nThe problem defines EMA as $W/F_b$.\n$$ \\mathrm{EMA} = \\frac{W}{F_b} = \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{N}}{960\\,\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.08333... $$\nSo, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.083$.\n\n**4. Qualitative Interpretation**\n- **Lever System:** In the absence of co-contraction ($\\alpha = 0$), the torque balance is $F_b' r_b = W L$. The required agonist force would be $F_b' = WL/r_b = 24/0.03 = 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$. The EMA would be $W/F_b' = 80/800 = 0.1$. Co-contraction requires the biceps to generate a larger force ($960\\,\\mathrm{N}$ vs. $800\\,\\mathrm{N}$) to sustain the same external load. This is because the triceps produces an opposing torque. The effective moment arm of the agonist becomes $r_{eff} = r_b - \\alpha r_t = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which is smaller than $r_b$. The ratio EMA is $r_{eff}/L = 0.025/0.30 \\approx 0.083$, confirming the reduction from the no-co-contraction value of $r_b/L = 0.1$. The system is no longer a simple third-class lever but a more complex system with opposing internal torques, correctly described as a compound lever.\n- **Joint Loading:**\n    - Without co-contraction ($F_b' = 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $F_t = 0$):\n        - $R_x' = F_b' \\cos\\phi_b = 800 \\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 772.7\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n        - $R_y' = W - F_b' \\sin\\phi_b = 80 - 800 \\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\approx -127.1\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n    - With co-contraction ($F_b = 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $F_t = 240\\,\\mathrm{N}$):\n        - $R_x = 1163.6\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n        - $R_y = -126.8\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- **Conclusion:** Co-contraction markedly increases the joint compressive force $R_x$ (from $\\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$ to $\\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$). For these specific angles, the shear force $R_y$ happens to remain almost unchanged and directed downward.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.083$; co-contraction converts the apparent third-class lever into a compound lever (opposing internal torques) that reduces the agonist’s effective mechanical advantage and markedly increases joint compression while maintaining a downward shear at these angles.**\n- **Numerical Values:** All four calculated values ($F_b$, $R_x$, $R_y$, EMA) match our derived results.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The interpretation is fully consistent with our analysis. Co-contraction creates a compound lever effect, reduces EMA (from $0.1$ to $0.083$), markedly increases joint compression (from $\\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$ to $\\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$), and maintains a downward shear.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $F_b \\approx 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.10$; co-contraction does not change the lever behavior, and joint shear cancels out.**\n- **Numerical Values:** These values correspond to a scenario without co-contraction, and even then, the shear force $R_y$ is incorrectly stated as zero. Our calculation for the no-co-contraction case gives $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The statements that co-contraction does not change lever behavior and that shear cancels out are both false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 0.69\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx +168\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.12$; co-contraction increases the agonist’s effective mechanical advantage and produces net upward shear.**\n- **Numerical Values:** While $F_b$ is correct, the values for $R_x$, $R_y$, and EMA are all incorrect.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The claims that EMA increases and that shear is upward are both false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.10$; co-contraction leaves the effective mechanical advantage unchanged and only increases compression.**\n- **Numerical Values:** $F_b$, $R_x$, and $R_y$ are correct, but the value for EMA is incorrect. It should be $\\approx 0.083$, not $0.10$.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The claim that EMA is unchanged is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Joint angles are collected in $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\theta_{\\text{hip}}, \\theta_{\\text{knee}}, \\theta_{\\text{ankle}}]$ in radians, measured relative to a neutral reference posture $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}=\\mathbf{0}$.\n- There are $6$ muscles ordered as:\n  $1$: Rectus femoris (RF), \n  $2$: Vasti (VAS),\n  $3$: Biceps femoris long head (BF),\n  $4$: Gastrocnemius (GAS),\n  $5$: Soleus (SOL),\n  $6$: Tibialis anterior (TA).\n- Maximum isometric forces (in $\\mathrm{N}$): \n  `F^{\\max} = [1200,\\,4000,\\,1500,\\,2000,\\,3000,\\,800]`.\n- Optimal fiber lengths (in $\\mathrm{m}$): \n  `\\ell^{\\text{opt}} = [0.08,\\,0.09,\\,0.11,\\,0.05,\\,0.04,\\,0.06]`.\n- Active force–length relationship: let the normalized fiber length be \n  $$\\ell^{\\text{norm}}_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{\\ell^{\\text{opt}}_i},$$\n  where the path length change for muscle $i$ is $\\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where\n  $$\\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sum_{j \\in \\{\\text{hip},\\text{knee},\\text{ankle}\\}} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_j} r_{ij}(\\phi)\\,d\\phi.$$\n  The active force–length factor is \n  $$f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\ell^{\\text{norm}}_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) - 1\\right)^2}{2\\,s^2}\\right),$$\n  with width parameter $s = 0.15$.\n- Angle-dependent moment arms (in $\\mathrm{m}$): for each muscle $i$ and joint $j$,\n  $$r_{ij}(\\theta_j) = r^{(0)}_{ij} + r^{(1)}_{ij}\\,\\sin(\\theta_j).$$\n  Use the following baseline and amplitude coefficients for $(r^{(0)}_{ij}, r^{(1)}_{ij})$:\n  - RF: hip $(0.03,\\,0.005)$, knee $(0.035,\\,0.004)$, ankle $(0.0,\\,0.0)$.\n  - VAS: hip $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, knee $(0.04,\\,0.003)$, ankle $(0.0,\\,0.0)$.\n  - BF: hip $(-0.05,\\,-0.005)$, knee $(-0.03,\\,-0.003)$, ankle $(0.0,\\,0.0)$.\n  - GAS: hip $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, knee $(-0.02,\\,-0.002)$, ankle $(-0.045,\\,-0.004)$.\n  - SOL: hip $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, knee $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, ankle $(-0.05,\\,-0.003)$.\n  - TA: hip $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, knee $(0.0,\\,0.0)$, ankle $(0.03,\\,0.002)$.\n- Sign convention for required torques (in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$): positive hip flexion torque, positive knee extension torque, positive ankle dorsiflexion torque.\n\nOptimization problem:\n- Decision variables: $\\mathbf{a} = [a_1,\\dots,a_6]^\\top$ with bounds $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$.\n- Objective: minimize $J(\\mathbf{a}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} a_i^2$.\n- Equality constraints (one per joint): for each joint $j$,\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{6} r_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,a_i\\,f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,F^{\\max}_i = T^{\\text{req}}_j.$$\n\nAngle unit specification: all angles must be in radians.\nTorque unit specification: all torques must be in $\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\nActivations are dimensionless. Express the final activation values as decimals rounded to three decimal places.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide solutions for the following four cases. In each case, report the activations in the specified muscle order $[ \\text{RF}, \\text{VAS}, \\text{BF}, \\text{GAS}, \\text{SOL}, \\text{TA} ]$.\n- Case $1$ (happy path): $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [0.0,\\,0.5,\\,0.0]$, $\\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}} = [0.0,\\,30.0,\\,0.0]$.\n- Case $2$ (boundary near-zero load): $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0]$, $\\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}} = [0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0]$.\n- Case $3$ (multi-joint demand): $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [0.2,\\,0.9,\\,-0.2]$, $\\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}} = [0.0,\\,40.0,\\,10.0]$.\n- Case $4$ (infeasible ankle demand): $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [0.0,\\,0.0,\\,0.0]$, $\\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}} = [0.0,\\,0.0,\\,40.0]$.\n\nOutput format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each element corresponds to one case in the same order and must be:\n- a list of $6$ activation values rounded to three decimal places if a feasible solution is found (constraint residual norm less than $10^{-3}$ and box bounds satisfied), or\n- an empty list `[]` if the problem is infeasible.\n\nFor example, a valid line has the structure \n`[ [a_{1,1},\\dots,a_{1,6}], [a_{2,1},\\dots,a_{2,6}], [a_{3,1},\\dots,a_{3,6}], [] ]`, \nwith all numbers rounded to three decimals.",
            "solution": "The problem presented is a valid, well-posed constrained optimization problem in the field of biomechanics. It asks for the determination of muscle activations that satisfy required net joint torques while minimizing a proxy for metabolic cost. The problem is scientifically grounded in established models of muscle mechanics and is formulated as a standard Quadratic Program (QP), for which a unique solution can be found if the constraints are feasible.\n\nThe objective is to find the vector of muscle activations $\\mathbf{a} = [a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_6]^\\top$ that minimizes the cost function:\n$$ J(\\mathbf{a}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} a_i^2 = \\mathbf{a}^\\top\\mathbf{a} $$\nsubject to a set of linear equality constraints representing joint torque equilibrium and box constraints on the activations.\n\nFor each of the $M=3$ joints, the equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,F_i = T^{\\text{req}}_j \\quad \\text{for } j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\} $$\nwhere $N=6$ is the number of muscles, $r_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is the moment arm of muscle $i$ about joint $j$ at the given posture $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, $F_i$ is the force generated by muscle $i$, and $T^{\\text{req}}_j$ is the required net torque at joint $j$.\n\nThe muscle force $F_i$ is modeled as:\n$$ F_i = a_i\\,f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,F^{\\max}_i $$\nHere, $a_i$ is the muscle activation ($0 \\le a_i \\le 1$), $F^{\\max}_i$ is the maximum isometric force, and $f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is the active force-length factor, which depends on the muscle's length at the given posture.\n\nSubstituting the force model into the equilibrium equation, we obtain a set of linear equations in terms of the activations $\\mathbf{a}$:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{6} \\left( r_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,F^{\\max}_i \\right) a_i = T^{\\text{req}}_j $$\nThis can be expressed in matrix form as:\n$$ \\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$ is a $3 \\times 6$ matrix of coefficients with entries $C_{ji} = r_{ij}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\,F^{\\max}_i$.\n\nThe solution process for each test case involves the following steps:\n\n1.  **Compute Moment Arms $r_{ij}(\\theta_j)$**:\n    For each muscle $i$ and joint $j$, the moment arm is a function of the corresponding joint angle $\\theta_j$:\n    $$ r_{ij}(\\theta_j) = r^{(0)}_{ij} + r^{(1)}_{ij}\\,\\sin(\\theta_j) $$\n    Given the posture $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [\\theta_{\\text{hip}}, \\theta_{\\text{knee}}, \\theta_{\\text{ankle}}]$ and the coefficients $r^{(0)}_{ij}$ and $r^{(1)}_{ij}$, we can compute the $3 \\times 6$ matrix of moment arms $\\mathbf{R}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$.\n\n2.  **Compute Muscle Path Length Change $\\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$**:\n    The change in muscle path length is determined by integrating the moment arms over the joint angle ranges.\n    $$ \\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_j} r_{ij}(\\phi)\\,d\\phi $$\n    The integral can be solved analytically:\n    $$ \\int_{0}^{\\theta_j} (r^{(0)}_{ij} + r^{(1)}_{ij}\\,\\sin(\\phi))\\,d\\phi = \\left[ r^{(0)}_{ij}\\,\\phi - r^{(1)}_{ij}\\,\\cos(\\phi) \\right]_{0}^{\\theta_j} = r^{(0)}_{ij}\\,\\theta_j + r^{(1)}_{ij}\\,(1 - \\cos(\\theta_j)) $$\n    This calculation is performed for each muscle $i$ by summing the contributions from all joints it crosses.\n\n3.  **Compute Active Force-Length Factor $f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$**:\n    The force-length factor $f_{\\ell,i}$ depends on the normalized fiber length $\\ell^{\\text{norm}}_i$.\n    $$ \\ell^{\\text{norm}}_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = 1 + \\frac{\\Delta \\ell_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}{\\ell^{\\text{opt}}_i} $$\n    where $\\ell^{\\text{opt}}_i$ is the optimal fiber length for muscle $i$. The factor is then computed using the given Gaussian relationship with width parameter $s=0.15$:\n    $$ f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\left(\\ell^{\\text{norm}}_i(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) - 1\\right)^2}{2\\,s^2}\\right) $$\n    This yields a vector $\\mathbf{f}_{\\ell}$ of length $6$.\n\n4.  **Construct the Constraint Matrix $\\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$**:\n    The entries of the $3 \\times 6$ constraint matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ are assembled using the quantities computed above:\n    $$ C_{ji} = r_{ij}(\\theta_j) \\cdot f_{\\ell,i}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\cdot F^{\\max}_i $$\n\n5.  **Solve the Quadratic Program**:\n    For each test case, we solve the following QP:\n    -   **Minimize**: $J(\\mathbf{a}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{6} a_i^2$\n    -   **Subject to**:\n        -   $\\mathbf{C}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\mathbf{a} = \\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}}$ (equality constraints)\n        -   $0 \\le a_i \\le 1$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$ (box constraints)\n\n    This is a convex optimization problem that can be reliably solved using numerical methods, such as the Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithm available in the `scipy.optimize` library. The algorithm is provided with the objective function, its gradient (which is $\\nabla J(\\mathbf{a}) = 2\\mathbf{a}$), the constraint equations and their Jacobian (which is the matrix $\\mathbf{C}$), and the bounds on the variables $\\mathbf{a}$.\n\n    If the solver finds a solution that satisfies the KKT conditions and the norm of the constraint residual vector, $\\|\\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{T}^{\\text{req}}\\|$, is less than the specified tolerance of $10^{-3}$, the solution is considered feasible. Otherwise, if the solver fails or the residual is too large, the problem is deemed infeasible for the given torque requirement, indicating that the required torques cannot be generated by the muscles at that posture. For infeasible cases, an empty list is reported.",
