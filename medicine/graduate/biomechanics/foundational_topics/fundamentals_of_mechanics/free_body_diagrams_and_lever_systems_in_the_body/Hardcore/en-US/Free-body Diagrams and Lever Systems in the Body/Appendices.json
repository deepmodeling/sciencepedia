This practice provides a quintessential example of this method by applying a free-body diagram to the knee joint during an isometric extension task. By isolating the tibia and applying Newton's laws, you will first use the rotational equilibrium equation ($\\sum M = 0$) to determine the immense force required from the quadriceps muscle, and then use the translational equilibrium equation ($\\sum F = 0$) to calculate the resulting compressive force on the patella, offering a clear insight into the large internal forces joints must withstand .",

            "problem": "A subject performs an isometric knee extension against a dynamometer that imposes a net external flexion moment of $50$ $\\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ about the tibiofemoral joint axis at a fixed knee posture. At this posture, the patellar tendon acts on the tibia with a perpendicular moment arm of $0.04$ $\\mathrm{m}$ relative to the joint axis. The patella is modeled as an ideal, frictionless pulley so that the quadriceps tendon and patellar tendon magnitudes are equal, that is, the quadriceps tendon–patellar tendon force ratio is $1$. The angle between the lines of action of the quadriceps tendon and the patellar tendon is $20$ degrees at this posture. Neglect the weight of the leg segments, ligament forces, and any co-contraction of antagonists, and assume static equilibrium.\n\nUsing Newton’s laws of motion and the definition of moment as force times its perpendicular distance to the axis, and using free-body diagram reasoning:\n- Determine the quadriceps muscle-tendon force required to exactly counterbalance the external flexion moment.\n- Determine the magnitude of the compressive patellofemoral (PF) joint reaction on the patella at this posture.\n\nExpress both answers in $\\mathrm{N}$ and round to four significant figures. Angles are in degrees.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides all necessary data and assumptions to solve for the requested quantities using the principles of static equilibrium in biomechanics. The model, while simplified, is a standard and appropriate representation for this type of analysis.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts, corresponding to the two quantities requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the quadriceps muscle-tendon force ($F_Q$).\n\nThis quantity is determined from the rotational equilibrium of the tibia about the tibiofemoral joint axis. The condition for static equilibrium requires that the sum of all moments about any point is zero. We choose the joint axis of rotation as our point of summation.\n\n$$\n\\sum M_{joint} = 0\n$$\n\nThe forces creating moments about this axis are the patellar tendon force and the external force from the dynamometer. Forces that pass through the axis of rotation, such as the tibiofemoral joint reaction force, produce no moment and are thus excluded from this equation. The weight of the leg is neglected as per the problem statement.\n\nThe dynamometer imposes a net external flexion moment, which we can denote as $M_{ext}$. The problem gives its magnitude as $M_{ext} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$. By convention, we can consider flexion moments (which would rotate the tibia clockwise from an anterior view) as negative and extension moments (counter-clockwise) as positive.\n\nThe quadriceps contraction results in a force exerted by the patellar tendon on the tibia, $F_{PT}$. This force acts with a perpendicular moment arm, $d_{PT}$, relative to the joint axis. This creates an extension moment, $M_{PT}$, that counteracts the external flexion moment.\n\n$$\nM_{PT} = F_{PT} \\times d_{PT}\n$$\n\nThe equilibrium equation is:\n\n$$\n\\sum M_{joint} = M_{PT} - M_{ext} = 0\n$$\n\n$$\nF_{PT} \\times d_{PT} - M_{ext} = 0\n$$\n\nSolving for the magnitude of the patellar tendon force, $F_{PT}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PT} = \\frac{M_{ext}}{d_{PT}}\n$$\n\nSubstituting the given values, $M_{ext} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}$ and $d_{PT} = 0.04 \\, \\mathrm{m}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PT} = \\frac{50 \\, \\mathrm{N \\cdot m}}{0.04 \\, \\mathrm{m}} = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the patella is modeled as an ideal, frictionless pulley, which implies that the tension is transmitted equally along the tendon system. Therefore, the magnitude of the quadriceps tendon force, $F_Q$, is equal to the magnitude of the patellar tendon force, $F_{PT}$.\n\n$$\nF_Q = F_{PT} = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to four significant figures. To express $1250$ with four significant figures, we write it as $1.250 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{N}$.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the patellofemoral (PF) joint reaction force ($F_{PF}$).\n\nThis quantity is determined from the translational equilibrium of the patella. A free-body diagram of the patella includes three forces: the quadriceps tendon force ($\\vec{F}_Q$), the patellar tendon force ($\\vec{F}_{PT}$), and the compressive patellofemoral joint reaction force ($\\vec{F}_{PF}$) exerted by the femur onto the patella.\n\nFor static equilibrium, the vector sum of these forces must be zero:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT} + \\vec{F}_{PF} = \\vec{0}\n$$\n\nThis means the joint reaction force must perfectly balance the resultant of the two tendon forces:\n\n$$\n\\vec{F}_{PF} = -(\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT})\n$$\n\nThe magnitude of the joint reaction force, $F_{PF}$, is therefore equal to the magnitude of the resultant of $\\vec{F}_Q$ and $\\vec{F}_{PT}$:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = |\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT}|\n$$\n\nWe are given that the magnitudes are equal, $| \\vec{F}_Q | = | \\vec{F}_{PT} | = F_Q = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}$, and the angle between their lines of action is $\\theta = 20^\\circ$.\n\nThe magnitude of the sum of two vectors of equal magnitude $F$ with an angle $\\theta$ between them can be found using vector components. By orienting a coordinate system such that the x-axis bisects the angle $\\theta$, the two tendon forces are at angles $+\\theta/2$ and $-\\theta/2$ relative to the x-axis. The sum of the force components along this axis is:\n\n$$\n(|\\vec{F}_Q + \\vec{F}_{PT}|)_x = F_Q \\cos(\\theta/2) + F_{PT} \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nThe components perpendicular to this axis cancel each other out. Since $F_Q = F_{PT}$, the magnitude of the resultant is:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2 F_Q \\cos(\\theta/2)\n$$\n\nWe substitute the known values: $F_Q = 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N}$ and $\\theta = 20^\\circ$, which gives $\\theta/2 = 10^\\circ$.\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2 \\times 1250 \\, \\mathrm{N} \\times \\cos(10^\\circ)\n$$\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2500 \\cos(10^\\circ) \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} \\approx 2500 \\times 0.984807753... \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n$$\nF_{PF} \\approx 2462.01938... \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nRounding this result to four significant figures gives:\n\n$$\nF_{PF} = 2462 \\, \\mathrm{N}\n$$\n\nThe two requested values are the quadriceps muscle-tendon force, $F_Q = 1.250 \\times 10^3 \\, \\mathrm{N}$, and the magnitude of the patellofemoral joint reaction force, $F_{PF} = 2462 \\, \\mathrm{N}$.",

This exercise advances the static equilibrium analysis by incorporating an antagonist triceps force alongside the agonist biceps force in a model of the elbow joint.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided information and first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe will analyze a free-body diagram of the forearm-hand segment. Let the elbow joint be the origin of a coordinate system $(0,0)$. The forearm axis lies along the x-axis, with positive $x$ pointing proximally (to the right, toward the shoulder). The y-axis is vertical, with positive $y$ pointing upward. The system is in static equilibrium, so the net force and net torque must be zero.\n\nThe forces acting on the segment are:\n1.  The external load $\\vec{W}$, acting at $x = -L$. $\\vec{W} = (0, -W)$.\n2.  The biceps force $\\vec{F}_b$. It acts at an angle $\\phi_b$ above the positive x-axis. $\\vec{F}_b = (F_b \\cos\\phi_b, F_b \\sin\\phi_b)$.\n3.  The triceps force $\\vec{F}_t$. It acts at an angle $\\phi_t$ below the positive x-axis. $\\vec{F}_t = (F_t \\cos\\phi_t, -F_t \\sin\\phi_t)$.\n4.  The joint reaction force $\\vec{J} = (J_x, J_y)$, exerted by the humerus on the ulna/radius at the elbow joint $(0,0)$.\n\nThe conditions for static equilibrium are:\n1.  Sum of torques about the elbow joint is zero: $\\sum \\tau_O = 0$.\n2.  Sum of forces in the x-direction is zero: $\\sum F_x = 0$.\n3.  Sum of forces in the y-direction is zero: $\\sum F_y = 0$.\n\n**1. Torque Equilibrium**\nWe sum the torques about the elbow joint $(O)$. Counter-clockwise torques are positive. The problem provides the moment arms $r_b$ and $r_t$, which are the perpendicular distances from the joint center to the muscle lines of action.\n- Torque from biceps (flexor): $\\tau_b = +F_b r_b$\n- Torque from triceps (extensor): $\\tau_t = -F_t r_t$\n- Torque from external load: $\\tau_W = -W L$\n- The joint reaction force $\\vec{J}$ produces zero torque about $O$.\n\nThe torque equilibrium equation is:\n$$ \\sum \\tau_O = F_b r_b - F_t r_t - W L = 0 $$\nGiven $F_t = \\alpha F_b$ with $\\alpha = 0.25$:\n$$ F_b r_b - (\\alpha F_b) r_t - W L = 0 $$\n$$ F_b (r_b - \\alpha r_t) = W L $$\nSolving for $F_b$:\n$$ F_b = \\frac{W L}{r_b - \\alpha r_t} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n- $W = 80\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n- $L = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_b = 0.03\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $r_t = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.25$\n$$ F_b = \\frac{(80\\,\\mathrm{N})(0.30\\,\\mathrm{m})}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{m} - (0.25)(0.02\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{0.03\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.005\\,\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{24\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}}{0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 960\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe required biceps force is $F_b = 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\nThe triceps force is $F_t = 0.25 \\times F_b = 0.25 \\times 960\\,\\mathrm{N} = 240\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n\n**2. Force Equilibrium and Joint Reaction Forces**\nThe sum of all force vectors must be zero: $\\vec{F}_b + \\vec{F}_t + \\vec{W} + \\vec{J} = \\vec{0}$.\n\n**x-component (horizontal):**\n$$ \\sum F_x = F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t + J_x = 0 $$\n$$ J_x = -(F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t) $$\nThe term $F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t$ represents the total force pulling the forearm proximally into the joint. The compressive force $R_x$ is the magnitude of this interaction. Per the problem's definition ($R_x$ is positive for compression), $R_x$ is the reaction to $J_x$:\n$$ R_x = -J_x = F_b \\cos\\phi_b + F_t \\cos\\phi_t $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ R_x = (960\\,\\mathrm{N})\\cos(15^{\\circ}) + (240\\,\\mathrm{N})\\cos(10^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R_x \\approx (960)(0.9659) + (240)(0.9848) \\approx 927.28\\,\\mathrm{N} + 236.35\\,\\mathrm{N} \\approx 1163.63\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nSo, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$. This is the compressive force on the joint.\n\n**y-component (vertical):**\n$$ \\sum F_y = F_b \\sin\\phi_b - F_t \\sin\\phi_t - W + J_y = 0 $$\nThe shear force $R_y$ is defined as the upward component, which corresponds to $J_y$:\n$$ R_y = J_y = W + F_t \\sin\\phi_t - F_b \\sin\\phi_b $$\nSubstituting values:\n$$ R_y = 80\\,\\mathrm{N} + (240\\,\\mathrm{N})\\sin(10^{\\circ}) - (960\\,\\mathrm{N})\\sin(15^{\\circ}) $$\n$$ R_y \\approx 80 + (240)(0.1736) - (960)(0.2588) \\approx 80 + 41.68\\,\\mathrm{N} - 248.45\\,\\mathrm{N} \\approx -126.77\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nSo, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$. The negative sign indicates the net shear force on the forearm at the joint is directed downward.\n\n**3. Effective Mechanical Advantage (EMA)**\nThe problem defines EMA as $W/F_b$.\n$$ \\mathrm{EMA} = \\frac{W}{F_b} = \\frac{80\\,\\mathrm{N}}{960\\,\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.08333... $$\nSo, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.083$.\n\n**4. Qualitative Interpretation**\n- **Lever System:** In the absence of co-contraction ($\\alpha = 0$), the torque balance is $F_b' r_b = W L$. The required agonist force would be $F_b' = WL/r_b = 24/0.03 = 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$. The EMA would be $W/F_b' = 80/800 = 0.1$. Co-contraction requires the biceps to generate a larger force ($960\\,\\mathrm{N}$ vs. $800\\,\\mathrm{N}$) to sustain the same external load. This is because the triceps produces an opposing torque. The effective moment arm of the agonist becomes $r_{eff} = r_b - \\alpha r_t = 0.025\\,\\mathrm{m}$, which is smaller than $r_b$. The ratio EMA is $r_{eff}/L = 0.025/0.30 \\approx 0.083$, confirming the reduction from the no-co-contraction value of $r_b/L = 0.1$. The system is no longer a simple third-class lever but a more complex system with opposing internal torques, correctly described as a compound lever.\n- **Joint Loading:**\n    - Without co-contraction ($F_b' = 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $F_t = 0$):\n        - $R_x' = F_b' \\cos\\phi_b = 800 \\cos(15^{\\circ}) \\approx 772.7\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n        - $R_y' = W - F_b' \\sin\\phi_b = 80 - 800 \\sin(15^{\\circ}) \\approx -127.1\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n    - With co-contraction ($F_b = 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $F_t = 240\\,\\mathrm{N}$):\n        - $R_x = 1163.6\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n        - $R_y = -126.8\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- **Conclusion:** Co-contraction markedly increases the joint compressive force $R_x$ (from $\\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$ to $\\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$). For these specific angles, the shear force $R_y$ happens to remain almost unchanged and directed downward.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.083$; co-contraction converts the apparent third-class lever into a compound lever (opposing internal torques) that reduces the agonist’s effective mechanical advantage and markedly increases joint compression while maintaining a downward shear at these angles.**\n- **Numerical Values:** All four calculated values ($F_b$, $R_x$, $R_y$, EMA) match our derived results.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The interpretation is fully consistent with our analysis. Co-contraction creates a compound lever effect, reduces EMA (from $0.1$ to $0.083$), markedly increases joint compression (from $\\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$ to $\\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$), and maintains a downward shear.\n- **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. $F_b \\approx 800\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 0.77\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.10$; co-contraction does not change the lever behavior, and joint shear cancels out.**\n- **Numerical Values:** These values correspond to a scenario without co-contraction, and even then, the shear force $R_y$ is incorrectly stated as zero. Our calculation for the no-co-contraction case gives $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The statements that co-contraction does not change lever behavior and that shear cancels out are both false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 0.69\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx +168\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.12$; co-contraction increases the agonist’s effective mechanical advantage and produces net upward shear.**\n- **Numerical Values:** While $F_b$ is correct, the values for $R_x$, $R_y$, and EMA are all incorrect.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The claims that EMA increases and that shear is upward are both false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. $F_b \\approx 960\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $R_x \\approx 1.16\\,\\mathrm{kN}$, $R_y \\approx -127\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $\\mathrm{EMA} \\approx 0.10$; co-contraction leaves the effective mechanical advantage unchanged and only increases compression.**\n- **Numerical Values:** $F_b$, $R_x$, and $R_y$ are correct, but the value for EMA is incorrect. It should be $\\approx 0.083$, not $0.10$.\n- **Qualitative Interpretation:** The claim that EMA is unchanged is false.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.",

Anthropometric tables provide dimensionless fractions for the segment mass, the COM location along the segment axis measured from the ankle, and the radius of gyration relative to segment length.

Using a free-body diagram about the ankle, derive the expression for the net ankle joint moment in terms of the segment mass, COM position vector, ground reaction force, gravitational acceleration, and the segment’s moment of inertia about its COM. Estimate the COM position and moment of inertia from the anthropometric tables, and then perform a first-order linear uncertainty propagation to obtain the standard uncertainty of the ankle moment arising solely from the uncertainties in the anthropometric fractions. Treat these anthropometric uncertainties as uncorrelated.\n\nUse the following data and conventions:\n- Body mass is $M_{b} = 75\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n- Foot segment length is $L = 0.26\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Foot orientation relative to the laboratory $x$-axis is $\\theta = 0.17\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n- Ground reaction force is $\\mathbf{F}_{G} = (F_{x}, F_{y}) = (-50,\\,900)\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n- Center of pressure relative to the ankle is $\\mathbf{r}_{OG} = (x_{G}, y_{G}) = (0.10,\\,-0.04)\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Center of mass linear acceleration is $\\mathbf{a}_{C} = (a_{x}, a_{y}) = (1.5,\\,-2.0)\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\n- Foot angular acceleration is $\\alpha = 18\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\n- Gravitational acceleration is $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\n- Anthropometric fractions (mean values with standard uncertainties) are: segment mass fraction $f_{m} = 0.0145 \\pm 0.0040$, COM location fraction along the segment from the ankle $f_{c} = 0.44 \\pm 0.03$, and radius of gyration fraction $k = 0.47 \\pm 0.05$.\n\nUse the anthropometric relations $m = f_{m} M_{b}$, $\\mathbf{r}_{OC} = f_{c} L (\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}})$, and $I = m (k L)^{2}$ for the segment mass, COM position, and moment of inertia about the COM, respectively. Assume planar motion about the out-of-plane axis, with moments taken about the ankle. Compute the standard uncertainty of the ankle moment arising from uncertainties in $f_{m}$, $f_{c}$, and $k$ using first-order linear error propagation. Round your final standard uncertainty to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$. Angles must be treated in radians.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the net ankle joint moment and the subsequent calculation of its uncertainty due to variability in anthropometric parameters. The analysis is based on the principles of rigid body dynamics in a two-dimensional sagittal plane.\n\nFirst, we establish a coordinate system and a free-body diagram for the foot segment. Let the ankle joint be the origin $O$ of a laboratory reference frame with horizontal axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{i}}$ and vertical axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$. The forces acting on the foot are:\n1. The net ankle joint force $\\mathbf{F}_{A}$ and net ankle joint moment $\\mathbf{M}_{A}$ exerted by the shank on the foot at the ankle joint $O$.\n2. The gravitational force $\\mathbf{F}_{g}$ acting at the segment's center of mass (COM), C.\n3. The ground reaction force (GRF) $\\mathbf{F}_{G}$ acting at the center of pressure (COP), G.\n\nThe equation for rotational motion of a rigid body about an arbitrary point $O$ (which may be accelerating) is given by Newton's second law for rotation:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_{O} = I_{C} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} + \\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times (m \\mathbf{a}_{C}) $$\nwhere $\\sum \\mathbf{M}_{O}$ is the sum of external moments about point $O$, $I_{C}$ is the moment of inertia of the body about its COM, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the angular acceleration of the body, $m$ is the mass of the body, $\\mathbf{r}_{OC}$ is the position vector from $O$ to the COM, and $\\mathbf{a}_{C}$ is the linear acceleration of the COM. For this planar problem, moments and angular accelerations are vectors perpendicular to the sagittal plane, along the $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ axis. We can thus work with their scalar magnitudes. Let counter-clockwise (CCW) be the positive direction.\n\nThe sum of external moments about the ankle $O$ is given by:\n$$ \\sum \\mathbf{M}_{O} = \\mathbf{M}_{A} + \\mathbf{r}_{OG} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{G} + \\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{g} $$\nEquating the two expressions for the sum of moments about $O$:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_{A} + \\mathbf{r}_{OG} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{G} + \\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{g} = I_{C} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} + \\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times (m \\mathbf{a}_{C}) $$\nSolving for the ankle moment $\\mathbf{M}_{A}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{M}_{A} = I_{C} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} - \\mathbf{r}_{OG} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{G} + \\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times (m \\mathbf{a}_{C} - \\mathbf{F}_{g}) $$\nThis is the general vector expression for the ankle moment. We now express this in scalar form for our two-dimensional problem. The relevant vectors and their components are:\n- Position of COP relative to ankle: $\\mathbf{r}_{OG} = x_{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + y_{G} \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$\n- Ground reaction force: $\\mathbf{F}_{G} = F_{x} \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + F_{y} \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$\n- Position of COM relative to ankle: $\\mathbf{r}_{OC} = x_{C} \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + y_{C} \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$\n- Gravitational force: $\\mathbf{F}_{g} = -mg \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$\n- COM acceleration: $\\mathbf{a}_{C} = a_{x} \\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + a_{y} \\hat{\\mathbf{j}}$\n- Ankle moment: $\\mathbf{M}_{A} = M_{A} \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$\n- Angular acceleration: $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = \\alpha \\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$\n\nThe scalar moments (z-components of the cross products) are:\n- Moment from GRF: $(\\mathbf{r}_{OG} \\times \\mathbf{F}_{G}) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = x_{G}F_{y} - y_{G}F_{x}$\n- Moment from inertial and gravitational forces combined: $(\\mathbf{r}_{OC} \\times (m \\mathbf{a}_{C} - \\mathbf{F}_{g})) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = x_{C}m(a_{y}+g) - y_{C}m a_{x}$\n\nSubstituting these into the scalar equation for $M_{A}$:\n$$ M_{A} = I_{C}\\alpha - (x_{G}F_{y} - y_{G}F_{x}) + m(x_{C}(a_{y}+g) - y_{C}a_{x}) $$\nNext, we substitute the given anthropometric relations to express $M_{A}$ as a function of the fractions $f_{m}$, $f_{c}$, and $k$.\nThe relations are:\n- Segment mass: $m = f_{m} M_{b}$\n- COM position vector: $\\mathbf{r}_{OC} = f_{c} L (\\cos\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{i}} + \\sin\\theta\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{j}})$. This implies $x_{C} = f_{c} L \\cos\\theta$ and $y_{C} = f_{c} L \\sin\\theta$.\n- Moment of inertia about COM: $I_{C} = m (kL)^2 = (f_{m} M_{b}) (kL)^2 = f_{m} k^2 M_{b} L^2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $M_{A}$:\n$$ M_{A}(f_{m}, f_{c}, k) = (f_{m} k^2 M_{b} L^2)\\alpha - (x_{G}F_{y} - y_{G}F_{x}) + (f_{m}M_{b})((f_{c}L\\cos\\theta)(a_{y}+g) - (f_{c}L\\sin\\theta)a_{x}) $$\nGrouping terms by the anthropometric fractions:\n$$ M_{A} = f_{m} k^2 (M_{b} L^2 \\alpha) + f_{m} f_{c} (M_{b}L(\\cos\\theta(a_{y}+g) - \\sin\\theta a_{x})) - (x_{G}F_{y} - y_{G}F_{x}) $$\nTo find the uncertainty in $M_A$ arising from the uncertainties in $f_{m}$, $f_{c}$, and $k$, we use the first-order linear uncertainty propagation formula for uncorrelated variables:\n$$ \\sigma_{M_A}^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_m}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{f_m}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_c}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{f_c}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial k}\\right)^2 \\sigma_k^2 $$\nWe define constants for the terms not involving the fractions:\nLet $C_1 = M_{b} L^2 \\alpha$, $C_2 = x_{G}F_{y} - y_{G}F_{x}$, and $C_3 = M_{b}L(\\cos\\theta(a_{y}+g) - \\sin\\theta a_{x})$.\nThe expression for $M_{A}$ becomes $M_{A} = f_{m} k^2 C_1 + f_{m} f_{c} C_3 - C_2$.\nThe partial derivatives, evaluated at the mean values of the fractions, are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_m} = k^2 C_1 + f_c C_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_c} = f_m C_3 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial k} = 2 f_m k C_1 $$\nWe now compute the numerical values.\nGiven data: $M_{b} = 75\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $L = 0.26\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\theta = 0.17\\,\\mathrm{rad}$, $F_{x} = -50\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $F_{y} = 900\\,\\mathrm{N}$, $x_{G} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $y_{G} = -0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $a_{x} = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, $a_{y} = -2.0\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, $\\alpha = 18\\,\\mathrm{rad}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$, $g = 9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.\nMean fraction values: $\\mu_{f_m} = 0.0145$, $\\mu_{f_c} = 0.44$, $\\mu_k = 0.47$.\nUncertainties: $\\sigma_{f_m} = 0.0040$, $\\sigma_{f_c} = 0.03$, $\\sigma_k = 0.05$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$:\n$$ C_1 = (75)(0.26)^2(18) = 75 \\times 0.0676 \\times 18 = 91.26\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ C_2 = (0.10)(900) - (-0.04)(-50) = 90 - 2 = 88\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ C_3 = (75)(0.26)[\\cos(0.17)(-2.0+9.81) - \\sin(0.17)(1.5)] $$\n$$ C_3 = 19.5[\\cos(0.17)(7.81) - \\sin(0.17)(1.5)] \\approx 19.5[(0.98553)(7.81) - (0.16917)(1.5)] $$\n$$ C_3 \\approx 19.5[7.697 - 0.2538] = 19.5 \\times 7.4432 \\approx 145.14\\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nNow, we evaluate the partial derivatives using the mean fraction values:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_m} \\approx (0.47)^2(91.26) + (0.44)(145.14) = 20.155 + 63.862 = 84.017\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial f_c} \\approx (0.0145)(145.14) = 2.1045\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_A}{\\partial k} \\approx 2(0.0145)(0.47)(91.26) = 1.2427\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\nFinally, we compute the variance $\\sigma_{M_A}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma_{M_A}^2 \\approx (84.017)^2(0.0040)^2 + (2.1045)^2(0.03)^2 + (1.2427)^2(0.05)^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma_{M_A}^2 \\approx (7058.8)(1.6 \\times 10^{-5}) + (4.4289)(9 \\times 10^{-4}) + (1.5443)(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{M_A}^2 \\approx 0.11294 + 0.003986 + 0.003861 = 0.120787\\,(\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m})^2 $$\nThe standard uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_{M_A} = \\sqrt{0.120787} \\approx 0.34754\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we obtain $0.348\\,\\mathrm{N}\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$.",
