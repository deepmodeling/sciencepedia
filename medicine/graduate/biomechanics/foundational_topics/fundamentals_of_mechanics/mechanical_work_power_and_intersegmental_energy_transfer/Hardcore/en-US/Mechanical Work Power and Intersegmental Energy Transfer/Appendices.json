            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on standard principles of rotational mechanics and biomechanics. The provided data are consistent and physically plausible, and the questions are specified with sufficient clarity to permit a unique solution.\n\n### Part A: Derivation of Power Bound and Conceptual Explanation\n\nThe problem defines mechanical work $W$ done by a joint moment $M$ over an angular displacement $d\\theta$ as $dW = M d\\theta$. Instantaneous mechanical power $P$ is the time rate of doing work, so we can write:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int M(\\theta(t)) \\, d\\theta = M(\\theta(t)) \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\n$$\nGiven that angular velocity is defined as $\\omega(t) = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$, the expression for instantaneous joint power simplifies to:\n$$\nP(t) = M(t)\\omega(t)\n$$\nWe are asked to find an inequality for the magnitude of the joint power, $|P(t)|$. Using the properties of absolute values:\n$$\n|P(t)| = |M(t)\\omega(t)| = |M(t)||\\omega(t)|\n$$\nThe problem states engineering-imposed safety constraints such that $|M(t)| \\leq M_{\\max}$ and $|\\omega(t)| \\leq \\omega_{\\max}$ for all time $t$. Applying these inequalities to the expression for power magnitude, we obtain:\n$$\n|P(t)| \\leq M_{\\max}\\omega_{\\max}\n$$\nThis inequality provides an upper bound on the magnitude of the instantaneous power that can be generated (concentric contraction, $P  0$) or absorbed (eccentric contraction, $P  0$) at the joint.\n\nThis bound relates to intersegmental energy transfer, which is a mechanism often mediated by biarticular muscles that cross two joints (e.g., the rectus femoris crossing the hip and knee). Such a muscle can perform concentric work at one joint while simultaneously undergoing eccentric work at the other. This action results in a transfer of mechanical energy from one body segment to another. For example, energy generated at the hip could be transferred to and expressed at the knee. The rate of this energy transfer is limited by the power characteristics of the joints involved. The bound $M_{\\max}\\omega_{\\max}$ establishes the maximum rate at which a single joint can either contribute to or receive energy from such a transfer. Therefore, it represents a fundamental limit on the speed and magnitude of energy redistribution within a multi-joint limb.\n\n### Part B: Computation of Peak Instantaneous Power\n\nFor Part B, we are given an empirical model for the net joint moment $M$ as a function of angular velocity $\\omega$ during a concentric knee extension ($ \\omega \\geq 0$):\n$$\nM(\\omega) = M_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\nwith constants $M_0 = 120\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$ and $\\omega_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. This model is valid for $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_0$. The instantaneous power as a function of angular velocity is:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = M(\\omega)\\omega = M_0\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_0}\\right)\\omega = M_0\\left(\\omega - \\frac{\\omega^2}{\\omega_0}\\right)\n$$\nThis power function must be maximized subject to a set of constraints:\n1.  The model's own domain: $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_0 = 12\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n2.  The allowable angular velocity: $\\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n3.  The allowable joint moment: The effective moment cannot exceed $M_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\n\nLet's analyze the third constraint. The model predicts a moment $M(\\omega) = 120(1 - \\omega/12)$. We must enforce $M(\\omega) \\leq 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$.\n$$\n120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12}\\right) \\leq 90\n$$\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12} \\leq \\frac{90}{120} = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\leq \\frac{\\omega}{12}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega \\geq \\frac{12}{4} = 3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nThis means that for angular velocities $\\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$, the theoretical moment from the model exceeds the allowable moment. The problem states that the *effective* joint moment cannot exceed $M_{\\mathrm{allow}}$. This implies the torque-velocity profile is capped. The effective moment, $M_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$, is therefore a piecewise function:\n$$\nM_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} M_{\\mathrm{allow}}  \\text{if } M(\\omega)  M_{\\mathrm{allow}} \\\\ M(\\omega)  \\text{if } M(\\omega) \\leq M_{\\mathrm{allow}} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThis translates to:\n$$\nM_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}  \\text{if } \\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} \\\\ 120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{12}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}  \\text{if } \\omega \\geq 3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe search for the peak power is also limited by the velocity constraint $\\omega \\leq \\omega_{\\mathrm{allow}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. Thus, the full domain for our analysis is $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe corresponding effective power function, $P_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = M_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)\\omega$, is also piecewise:\n$$\nP_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} 90\\omega  \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega  3 \\\\ 120\\left(\\omega - \\frac{\\omega^2}{12}\\right)  \\text{for } 3 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7 \\end{cases}\n$$\nWe must find the maximum of $P_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ on the interval $[0, 7]$. We analyze each piece separately.\n\nCase 1: $0 \\leq \\omega  3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\nThe power function is $P_1(\\omega) = 90\\omega$. This is a linearly increasing function. Its maximum value on this interval occurs as $\\omega$ approaches its upper bound.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega \\to 3^-} P_1(\\omega) = 90 \\times 3 = 270\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n\nCase 2: $3 \\leq \\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$\nThe power function is $P_2(\\omega) = 120(\\omega - \\omega^2/12)$. This is a quadratic function representing a downward-opening parabola. To find its maximum, we take the derivative with respect to $\\omega$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dP_2}{d\\omega} = 120\\left(1 - \\frac{2\\omega}{12}\\right) = 120\\left(1 - \\frac{\\omega}{6}\\right)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero: $1 - \\frac{\\omega}{6} = 0 \\implies \\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\nThis value $\\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ lies within the interval for this case, $[3, 7]$. Since the parabola opens downwards, this is the location of the maximum for this piece. We calculate the power at this velocity:\n$$\nP_2(6) = 120\\left(6 - \\frac{6^2}{12}\\right) = 120\\left(6 - \\frac{36}{12}\\right) = 120(6-3) = 120(3) = 360\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n\nComparing the maximum power from both regions, we have $270\\,\\mathrm{W}$ from the first piece and $360\\,\\mathrm{W}$ from the second. The theoretical peak instantaneous joint power under all constraints is the greater of these two values.\n$$\nP_{\\text{peak}} = \\max(270\\,\\mathrm{W}, 360\\,\\mathrm{W}) = 360\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nAt this peak power, the operating point is $\\omega = 6\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $M = M(6) = 120(1 - 6/12) = 60\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$. Both values are within the allowable limits ($\\omega \\leq 7\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$ and $M \\leq 90\\,\\mathrm{N\\cdot m}$).\n\nThe problem requests the answer rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $360\\,\\mathrm{W}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $360.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.",

Individual limb external work is the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the COM velocity, while whole-body external work is the time integral of the net external force (sum of limb GRFs and other external forces such as gravity) dotted with the COM velocity. Consequently, whole-body external work can be $0$ in steady gait even when limb-specific external works are nonzero and asymmetric; therefore, asymmetry analysis should use limb-resolved external work rather than whole-body COM external work alone.\n\nB.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivations and Computations\n\n**1) Derive Expressions for Power**\n\nThe instantaneous power $P$ delivered by a force $\\mathbf{F}$ is given by the dot product of the force and the velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ of the point of application of the force, $P = \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$. However, the problem specifies the context of the work-energy theorem *for the COM*. This theorem states that the rate of change of the COM's kinetic energy ($K_{\\text{COM}} = \\frac{1}{2}m v_{\\text{COM}}^2$) is equal to the dot product of the *net external force* and the *COM velocity*.\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}K_{\\text{COM}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{COM}} $$\nThis quantity, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{COM}}$, is defined as the whole-body external power delivered to the COM.\n\n-   **Instantaneous external power delivered to the COM by a single limb:**\n    Within this framework, the contribution of a single external force, such as the GRF from one limb ($\\mathbf{F}_{i}$), to the total power delivered to the COM is defined as the dot product of that force with the COM velocity. This is a standard convention in COM-based gait analysis.\n    Therefore, the instantaneous external power delivered to the COM by a single limb $i$ from its GRF $\\mathbf{F}_{i}$ is:\n    $$ P_{i} = \\mathbf{F}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n\n-   **Whole-body external power delivered to the COM:**\n    This is the sum of the power contributions from all external forces. The external forces are $\\mathbf{F}_{L}$, $\\mathbf{F}_{R}$, and $\\mathbf{F}_{g}$.\n    $$ P_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{F}_{L} + \\mathbf{F}_{R} + \\mathbf{F}_{g}) \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n    Since $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{F}_{L} + \\mathbf{F}_{R} + \\mathbf{F}_{g}$, this is equivalent to:\n    $$ P_{\\text{whole-body}} = \\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} $$\n\n**2) Compute External Work Over the Interval**\n\nWork $W$ is the time integral of power $P$. Since all forces and the COM velocity are constant over the interval $\\Delta t = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, the power is also constant. Thus, work is simply $W = P \\cdot \\Delta t$.\n\n-   **Individual limb external work for the left limb ($W_L$):**\n    $$ W_L = (\\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\mathbf{F}_{L} = (-50, 412.02)\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n    $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (-50)(1.2) + (412.02)(0.05) = -60 + 20.601 = -39.399\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\n    $$ W_L = (-39.399\\,\\mathrm{W}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = -7.8798\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\n-   **Individual limb external work for the right limb ($W_R$):**\n    $$ W_R = (\\mathbf{F}_{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    Using the given values:\n    $\\mathbf{F}_{R} = (+50, 274.68)\\,\\mathrm{N}$\n    $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n    $$ \\mathbf{F}_{R} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}} = (50)(1.2) + (274.68)(0.05) = 60 + 13.734 = 73.734\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\n    $$ W_R = (73.734\\,\\mathrm{W}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 14.7468\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n\n-   **Whole-body external work ($W_{\\text{whole-body}}$):**\n    $$ W_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}) \\Delta t $$\n    As shown in the validation, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{net}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n    $$ W_{\\text{whole-body}} = (\\mathbf{0} \\cdot (1.2, 0.05)\\,\\mathrm{m/s}) (0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = (0\\,\\mathrm{W})(0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\n    This result is also directly given by the work-energy theorem for the COM: $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$. Since $\\mathbf{v}_{\\mathrm{COM}}$ is constant, the change in COM kinetic energy, $\\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$, is zero. Therefore, $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n\n**Numerical Summary:**\n-   $W_L \\approx -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$ (negative work, often called 'braking')\n-   $W_R \\approx 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$ (positive work, often called 'propulsion')\n-   $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\n**3) Analysis of Options**\n\nBased on the derivations and calculations, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. Individual limb external work is the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the COM velocity, while whole-body external work is the time integral of the net external force (sum of limb GRFs and other external forces such as gravity) dotted with the COM velocity. Consequently, whole-body external work can be $0$ in steady gait even when limb-specific external works are nonzero and asymmetric; therefore, asymmetry analysis should use limb-resolved external work rather than whole-body COM external work alone.**\n-   The definitions of individual limb work and whole-body work match our derivations perfectly.\n-   The consequence that whole-body work can be zero ($W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$) while limb-specific works are non-zero and asymmetric ($W_L \\approx -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$, $W_R \\approx 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$) is directly demonstrated by our calculations.\n-   The final conclusion that asymmetry analysis requires examining limb-resolved work is a sound and logical implication, as the whole-body metric ($0\\,\\mathrm{J}$) completely masks the substantial asymmetry between the left and right limbs' contributions.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Individual limb external work equals the time integral of that limb’s GRF dotted with the foot velocity during stance, and whole-body external work equals the sum of the limb external works. Therefore, identical foot speeds during stance guarantee symmetry of limb external work even if the GRFs differ.**\n-   The definition provided for individual limb external work is $\\int \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{\\text{foot}} \\mathrm{d}t$. Since the feet do not slip, $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{foot}} = \\mathbf{0}$. This would mean limb external work is always zero, which contradicts our calculation based on the COM work-energy theorem ($W_L \\neq 0, W_R \\neq 0$). This is the work done *at the point of force application*, not the work done *on the COM*.\n-   The statement that whole-body external work is the sum of limb external works is also false. $W_L + W_R = -7.88 + 14.75 = 6.87\\,\\mathrm{J}$, which is not equal to $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$. This sum omits the work done by gravity.\n-   The final conclusion is based on a false premise and is itself false. Foot speeds are identically zero, yet the limb works are asymmetric.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Individual limb external work is the change in that limb’s segmental kinetic plus potential energy, whereas whole-body external work is the change in COM energy. Thus, if whole-body external work is $0$ under steady-speed, level walking, each limb’s external work must be $0$, and asymmetry cannot exist.**\n-   The definition of individual limb external work is incorrect in the context of COM analysis. It describes the work-energy relationship for a limb segment, not the contribution of the limb's external force to the whole-body COM energy.\n-   The definition of whole-body external work as the \"change in COM energy\" is ambiguous. The work done by all external forces (including conservative ones like gravity) equals the change in *kinetic* energy of the COM ($W_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}}$). The work done by *non-conservative* external forces equals the change in *total* energy of the COM ($W_{\\text{nc}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{COM}} = \\Delta K_{\\text{COM}} + \\Delta U_{\\text{COM}}$). The statement is imprecise.\n-   The conclusion that if whole-body work is zero, then each limb's work must also be zero is directly contradicted by our calculations ($W_{\\text{whole-body}}=0\\,\\mathrm{J}$, but $W_L \\neq 0$ and $W_R \\neq 0$).\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Whole-body external work equals the algebraic sum of positive work from the propulsive limb only, because braking work cancels within the limb and does not affect the COM. Therefore, asymmetry should be quantified solely by the net positive work of the dominant limb.**\n-   The first clause is false. Our calculation showed $W_{\\text{whole-body}} = 0\\,\\mathrm{J}$, while the positive work from the right (propulsive) limb was $W_R = 14.75\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n-   The reasoning that \"braking work cancels within the limb\" is mechanistically false. The braking GRF is an external force that performs negative work on the COM, directly affecting its motion and energy. The work is $W_L = -7.88\\,\\mathrm{J}$, which is not cancelled. It is a transfer of energy from the COM to the body's internal state.\n-   The conclusion to quantify asymmetry by only one limb's contribution is an oversimplification that ignores the crucial information provided by the other limb.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
