Seemingly minor errors, such as mislabeled markers or an accidental system reflection, can invalidate an entire dataset. This exercise challenges you to design a robust validation procedure by leveraging the fundamental geometric properties of rigid bodies, namely the invariance of inter-marker distances and the preservation of orientation. Mastering these principles is crucial for developing and implementing automated quality control checks that are essential for rigorous biomechanical analysis. ",

            "solution": "The user requires a critical validation of the problem statement, followed by a rigorous derivation of the solution and evaluation of all options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n*   **System**: A rigid body segment with a non-degenerate cluster of $4$ non-collinear skin-mounted markers.\n*   **Template Data**: The configuration of labeled markers in the segment-fixed frame is $\\{\\mathbf{p}_i\\}_{i=1}^{4} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$. The centroid is $\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\mathbf{p}_i$.\n*   **Measured Data**: The laboratory-frame positions at time $t$ are $\\{\\mathbf{x}_i(t)\\}_{i=1}^{4} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3$. The centroid is $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\mathbf{x}_i(t)$.\n*   **Kinematic Model**: $\\mathbf{x}_i(t) \\approx \\mathbf{R}(t)\\,\\mathbf{p}_i + \\mathbf{t}(t)$, for $i=1,\\dots,4$. This model includes small measurement noise.\n*   **Rotation Matrix Properties**: $\\mathbf{R}(t)$ is a rotation matrix, meaning it is orthogonal ($\\mathbf{R}(t)^\\top \\mathbf{R}(t) = \\mathbf{I}$) and has a determinant of $+1$ ($\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t)) = +1$) under ideal (error-free) conditions. $\\mathbf{t}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is the translation vector.\n*   **Error Types**: The procedure must detect (1) mislabeled markers (marker swaps) and (2) mirroring errors (e.g., left-right flip, odd permutation of correspondences).\n*   **Goal**: Design a detection procedure to flag these errors at each time $t$, robustly in the presence of small noise. The procedure must check whether (a) the reconstructed segment frame remains right-handed and (b) inter-marker distances are preserved for the labeled markers.\n*   **Allowed Principles**:\n    *   (i) Rigid-body transformations preserve pairwise distances: $\\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\| = \\|\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$ for an exact rigid motion.\n    *   (ii) An orthogonal matrix has determinant $\\pm 1$. $\\det = +1$ for proper rotations (right-handed), and $\\det = -1$ for improper rotations/reflections (left-handed).\n    *   (iii) The cross product and scalar triple product relate to a right-handed coordinate system.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem statement is firmly grounded in the principles of rigid-body kinematics, linear algebra, and data analysis as applied to biomechanics and motion capture. The model $\\mathbf{x}_i \\approx \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_i + \\mathbf{t}$ and the use of point-set registration techniques (like Orthogonal Procrustes) are standard in the field. The error types (marker swaps, reflections) are practical issues in experimental setups. All principles are factually correct.\n*   **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies the input data ($\\{\\mathbf{p}_i\\}, \\{\\mathbf{x_i}(t)\\}$), the types of errors to detect, and the criteria for detection (preservation of right-handedness and labeled distances). It asks for a procedure that is \"necessary and sufficient,\" which is a clear logical requirement. A unique conceptual solution exists.\n*   **Objectivity**: The language is precise, mathematical, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement exhibits no flaws. It is a scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective problem in computational biomechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\n*   **Verdict**: The problem is valid.\n*   **Action**: Proceed to the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem requires a procedure that is both necessary and sufficient to detect marker swaps and mirroring errors by implementing two specific checks: (1) ensuring the reconstructed frame is right-handed, and (2) verifying that inter-marker distances are preserved for the *labeled* markers.\n\n**Fundamental Analysis**\n\n1.  **Detecting Mirroring Errors and Ensuring a Right-Handed Frame**: A mirroring error corresponds to a transformation that flips the orientation of the object. In the context of the rigid body model $\\mathbf{x}_i \\approx \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_i + \\mathbf{t}$, the orientation is captured by the determinant of the orthogonal matrix $\\mathbf{R}$. A proper rotation, which preserves the \"handedness\" of the coordinate frame, has $\\det(\\mathbf{R}) = +1$. An improper rotation (a reflection combined with a rotation) has $\\det(\\mathbf{R}) = -1$. Therefore, to detect a mirroring error and ensure the reconstructed frame remains right-handed, it is **necessary and sufficient** to estimate the best-fit orthogonal transformation matrix between the point sets $\\{\\mathbf{p}_i\\}$ and $\\{\\mathbf{x}_i(t)\\}$ and then check the sign of its determinant. A negative determinant signals an error.\n\n2.  **Detecting Marker Swaps and Verifying Labeled Distances**: A rigid transformation, whether proper or improper, preserves all pairwise distances. That is, if point $\\mathbf{p}_i$ is transformed to $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{p}_j$ to $\\mathbf{x}_j$, then $\\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\mathbf{x}_j\\| = \\|\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_j\\| = \\|\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$. This holds true when the labels are correct.\n    Now, consider a swap between marker $k$ and marker $l$. The measurement `k` is now associated with the template point `l`, and vice versa. That is, we observe $\\mathbf{x}_k$ and $\\mathbf{x}_l$, but the underlying physical reality (ignoring noise) is $\\mathbf{x}_k = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_l + \\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_l = \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_k + \\mathbf{t}$. If we check the distance for the *labeled* pair $(k, j)$ where $j \\neq k, l$, we would compare $\\|\\mathbf{x}_k(t) - \\mathbf{x}_j(t)\\|$ with the template distance $\\|\\mathbf{p}_k - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$. However, the measured distance is actually $\\|\\mathbf{x}_k(t) - \\mathbf{x}_j(t)\\| \\approx \\|\\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_l - \\mathbf{R}\\mathbf{p}_j\\| = \\|\\mathbf{p}_l - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$. Since the marker cluster is non-degenerate, we generally have $\\|\\mathbf{p}_l - \\mathbf{p}_j\\| \\neq \\|\\mathbf{p}_k - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$. This discrepancy, if larger than a noise tolerance, detects the swap. Therefore, checking that $\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \\mathbf{x}_j(t)\\| \\approx \\|\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|$ for all *labeled pairs* $(i,j)$ is a **necessary and sufficient** method to detect marker swaps.\n\nA complete procedure must incorporate both of these checks.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. Center both point sets by subtracting their centroids, estimate the best-fit orthogonal transform between labeled correspondences via an orthogonal Procrustes step (e.g., using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)), extract $\\mathbf{R}(t)$, and compute $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t))$. Flag an error if $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t)) < 0$. Independently, compute the vector of pairwise distances between labeled markers $\\{\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \\mathbf{x}_j(t)\\|\\}_{i<j}$ and compare it against the template distances $\\{\\|\\mathbf{p}_i - \\mathbf{p}_j\\|\\}_{i<j}$; flag an error if the maximum absolute deviation exceeds a tolerance $\\varepsilon_d > 0$. Accept the frame only if $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t)) > 0$ and all pairwise distance deviations are within $\\varepsilon_d$.**\n\nThis option proposes a two-part procedure:\n1.  **Orientation Check**: It uses the standard Orthogonal Procrustes method (which is typically solved via SVD of the covariance matrix) to find the best-fit orthogonal matrix and checks its determinant. This is the correct and robust way to detect mirroring errors, fulfilling the requirement to check for a right-handed frame.\n2.  **Labeled Distance Check**: It explicitly compares the pairwise distances of the *labeled* markers in the measured configuration to the corresponding distances in the template configuration. As derived above, this is the correct way to detect marker swaps.\n\nThe combination of these two checks is both necessary (each check addresses a distinct error type) and sufficient to detect both mirroring and swap errors, in line with the problem's requirements. The use of a tolerance $\\varepsilon_d$ makes the distance check robust to small noise, and the least-squares nature of the Procrustes analysis is also noise-robust.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Compare only the centroids and the total scatter: compute $\\|\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t) - \\mathbf{R}_0\\bar{\\mathbf{p}} - \\mathbf{t}_0\\|$ for a fixed nominal $\\mathbf{R}_0,\\mathbf{t}_0$, and compute the sum of squared distances to the centroid $\\sum_{i=1}^{4}\\|\\mathbf{x}_i(t) - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t)\\|^2$; flag an error if either deviates beyond thresholds. Do not check $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t))$ or labeled pairwise distances.**\n\nThis option is flawed.\n1.  The centroid $\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}(t) = \\frac{1}{4}\\sum \\mathbf{x}_i(t)$ is invariant to permutations (swaps) of the marker labels. Therefore, checking the centroid cannot detect swaps.\n2.  The sum of squared distances from the centroid, known as the total scatter, is $\\sum_i \\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}\\|^2$. For a rigid transformation, $\\sum_i \\|\\mathbf{x}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{x}}\\|^2 = \\sum_i \\|\\mathbf{R}(\\mathbf{p}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{p}})\\|^2 = \\sum_i \\|\\mathbf{p}_i - \\bar{\\mathbf{p}}\\|^2$. This quantity is preserved under any orthogonal transformation (rotation or reflection) and is also invariant to marker swaps. Thus, it cannot detect mirroring or swaps. It can only detect non-rigid deformation of the cluster.\n3.  The option explicitly states not to perform the two checks (determinant and labeled distances) that are fundamental to solving the problem.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Construct a segment frame from three selected labeled vectors, e.g., $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 \\propto \\mathbf{x}_2 - \\mathbf{x}_1$, $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2 \\propto \\mathbf{x}_3 - \\mathbf{x}_1$, and $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$, and check the sign of the scalar triple product $\\det[\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1\\ \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2\\ \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3]$ to enforce right-handedness. Additionally, check that the multiset of pairwise distances among $\\{\\mathbf{x}_i(t)\\}$, ignoring labels, matches the multiset for $\\{\\mathbf{p}_i\\}$ within a tolerance. Accept the frame if both checks pass.**\n\nThis option is also flawed.\n1.  The scalar triple product check, as described, is trivial. By construction, $\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2$, so the constructed frame $\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2, \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\\}$ is guaranteed to be right-handed (assuming it's not degenerate). The scalar triple product $(\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_1 \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_2) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 = \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3 = \\|\\hat{\\mathbf{e}}_3\\|^2$ will always be non-negative. This procedure does not compare the orientation of the new frame to the template frame, so it cannot detect a reflection.\n2.  The distance check is performed on the *multiset* of distances, \"ignoring labels\". This means it checks if the set of six distance values is preserved, but not the correspondence. A marker swap simply permutes the distances among the pairs, but the overall set of distance values remains the same. Therefore, this check cannot detect marker swaps.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Compute Euler angles for the segment across time and enforce temporal continuity by flagging any time at which any Euler angle changes by more than a threshold $\\varepsilon_\\theta > 0$. Do not compute $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t))$ or distances. Assume continuity is sufficient to catch swaps or mirroring.**\n\nThis option relies on a temporal heuristic, not a fundamental geometric check at a single time point $t$ as the problem asks.\n1.  **Insufficiency**: If a marker swap or mirroring error is present in the very first frame of data, there is no \"jump\" to detect. Temporal continuity checks can fail.\n2.  **Unnecessary**: It is not necessary to have a time series to detect these errors. They can be detected in a single static frame using the geometric methods of Option A.\n3.  **Contradiction**: The option explicitly states \"Do not compute $\\det(\\mathbf{R}(t))$ or distances,\" thereby failing to perform the very checks the problem statement mandates for a valid procedure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe procedure to construct the basis vectors is followed sequentially.\n\n**1. Calculation of the first basis vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$:**\nThe vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ is defined as the unit vector in the direction of $\\mathbf{u}$. This is calculated by dividing $\\mathbf{u}$ by its Euclidean norm, $\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|$.\nFirst, calculate the norm of $\\mathbf{u}$:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = \\sqrt{36^2 + (-12)^2 + 48^2} $$\nTo simplify the arithmetic, we can factor out the greatest common divisor of the components of $\\mathbf{u}$, which is $12$.\n$$ \\mathbf{u} = 12 \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe norm is then:\n$$ \\|\\mathbf{u}\\| = |12| \\sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2 + 4^2} = 12 \\sqrt{9 + 1 + 16} = 12\\sqrt{26} $$\nNow, we find the unit vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{\\|\\mathbf{u}\\|} = \\frac{12 \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix}}{12\\sqrt{26}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3/\\sqrt{26} \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{26} \\\\ 4/\\sqrt{26} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**2. Calculation of the second basis vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$:**\nThe vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is found by applying the Gram-Schmidt process to orthogonalize $\\mathbf{v}$ with respect to $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$, and then normalizing the result.\nLet $\\mathbf{w}$ be the component of $\\mathbf{v}$ that is orthogonal to $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$.\n$$ \\mathbf{w} = \\mathbf{v} - (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}})\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} $$\nWe must first compute the dot product $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$:\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 18 \\\\ 30 \\\\ -6 \\end{pmatrix} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}} (18 \\cdot 3 + 30 \\cdot (-1) + (-6) \\cdot 4) $$\n$$ \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}} (54 - 30 - 24) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}}(0) = 0 $$\nThe dot product is zero, which signifies that the original vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$ are already orthogonal.

Calculation of the third basis vector, $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$:**\nThe vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ is defined by the cross product of $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ and $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ to form a right-handed system.\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{35}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) $$\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{26}\\sqrt{35}} \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe scalar prefactor is $1/\\sqrt{26 \\cdot 35} = 1/\\sqrt{910}$.\nThe cross product of the integer vectors is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\times \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (-1)(-1) - (4)(5) \\\\ (4)(3) - (3)(-1) \\\\ (3)(5) - (-1)(3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 - 20 \\\\ 12 + 3 \\\\ 15 + 3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -19 \\\\ 15 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThus, the third basis vector is:\n$$ \\hat{\\mathbf{z}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{910}} \\begin{pmatrix} -19 \\\\ 15 \\\\ 18 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -19/\\sqrt{910} \\\\ 15/\\sqrt{910} \\\\ 18/\\sqrt{910} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**4.

It describes a realistic scenario in biomechanics where different laboratory standards for coordinate systems must be reconciled. The given information is self-contained and sufficient for a solution. The frame definitions are precise: $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is a right-handed system. The frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ is constructed by flipping one axis of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ ($\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}} = -\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}}$), which makes $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ a left-handed system, since $\\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} \\times \\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{A}} \\times (-\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}}) = -(\\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{A}} \\times \\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}}) = -\\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{A}} = -\\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{B}}$. The problem is well-posed, objective, and does not violate any validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Inconsistency Detection Criterion and Application**\n\nA Direction Cosine Matrix (DCM) represents a coordinate transformation. The problem states that segment frames $\\mathcal{S}$ are standard, which implies they are right-handed. The global frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is explicitly defined as right-handed. A transformation between two right-handed coordinate systems is a pure rotation, represented by a proper orthogonal matrix, whose determinant is $+1$.\n\nThe global frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ has basis vectors related to $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ by $\\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{A}}$, $\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}} = -\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}}$, $\\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{B}} = \\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{A}}$. This constitutes a reflection of the $y$-axis, changing the system's handedness from right to left. A transformation from a right-handed frame ($\\mathcal{S}$) to a left-handed frame ($\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$) is a rotoreflection (a rotation followed by a reflection). Such a transformation is represented by an improper orthogonal matrix, whose determinant is $-1$.\n\nTherefore, the detection criterion for the sign-convention inconsistency is to compute the determinant of the reported DCM, $R_{\\mathcal{B}}$. If $\\det(R_{\\mathcal{B}}) = -1$, it confirms that the target frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ has a different handedness than the source frame $\\mathcal{S}$, which is the described inconsistency.\n\nApplying this criterion to the given $R_{\\mathcal{B}}$:\n$$\n\\det(R_{\\mathcal{B}}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing cofactor expansion along the third row:\n$$\n\\det(R_{\\mathcal{B}}) = 1 \\cdot \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\end{pmatrix} - 0 + 0 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{4} = -1.\n$$\nThe result $\\det(R_{\\mathcal{B}}) = -1$ confirms the presence of a sign-convention inconsistency, as predicted.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Axis-Flip Matrix $F_{y}$ and $R_{\\mathcal{A}}$**\n\nThe matrix $F_{y}$ transforms the coordinates of a vector from frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ to frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$. Let a physical vector $\\vec{v}$ have coordinate representations $v_{\\mathcal{A}} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)^T$ in frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$ and $v_{\\mathcal{B}}$ in frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$, such that $v_{\\mathcal{B}} = F_y v_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nThe vector is given by $\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{A}} + v_y \\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}} + v_z \\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nTo find its components in $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$, we substitute the basis vector relations: $\\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{A}}=\\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{B}}$, $\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{A}}=-\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}}$, $\\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{A}}=\\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{B}}$.\n$$\n\\vec{v} = v_x \\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} + v_y (-\\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}}) + v_z \\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{B}} = v_x \\hat{x}_{\\mathcal{B}} - v_y \\hat{y}_{\\mathcal{B}} + v_z \\hat{z}_{\\mathcal{B}}.\n$$\nThe coordinates in frame $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}$ are therefore $(v_x, -v_y, v_z)^T$. The matrix $F_y$ that performs this mapping is:\n$$\nF_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis is a reflection matrix across the $xz$-plane.\n\nNow, we construct the corrected DCM $R_{\\mathcal{A}}$. We have the following relations:\n1. $v_{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}} = R_{\\mathcal{B}} v_{\\mathcal{S}}$ (from lab $\\mathcal{B}$'s measurement)\n2. $v_{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}} = R_{\\mathcal{A}} v_{\\mathcal{S}}$ (the desired DCM for lab $\\mathcal{A}$)\n3. $v_{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}} = F_y v_{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}}$ (the frame conversion)\n\nSubstitute (2) into (3): $v_{\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{B}}} = F_y (R_{\\mathcal{A}} v_{\\mathcal{S}})$.\nEquating this with (1) gives $R_{\\mathcal{B}} v_{\\mathcal{S}} = (F_y R_{\\mathcal{A}}) v_{\\mathcal{S}}$. Since this holds for any $v_{\\mathcal{S}}$, the matrix relation is $R_{\\mathcal{B}} = F_y R_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\nTo find $R_{\\mathcal{A}}$, we pre-multiply by the inverse of $F_y$. The matrix $F_y$ is its own inverse, since $F_y F_y = I$. Thus, $F_y^{-1} = F_y$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{A}} = F_y^{-1} R_{\\mathcal{B}} = F_y R_{\\mathcal{B}}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n-\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAs a check, $\\det(R_{\\mathcal{A}}) = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) - (-\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = 1$. The corrected DCM is a proper rotation matrix.\n\n**Part 3: Identification of the Signed Yaw Angle $\\phi$**\n\nThe problem states the segment underwent a \"pure axial rotation about the superior axis, with an unknown signed angle $\\phi$ about the $z$-axis of $\\mathcal{G}_{\\mathcal{A}}$.\" This corresponds to a yaw rotation. The elementary rotation matrix for a passive rotation by an angle $\\phi$ about the $z$-axis is:\n$$\nR_z(\\phi) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\phi) & -\\sin(\\phi) & 0 \\\\\n\\sin(\\phi) & \\cos(\\phi) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe problem's mention of a \"$z$-$y$-$x$ intrinsic sequence\" indicates that yaw is the first rotation in this sequence. For a \"pure axial rotation\", the subsequent pitch and roll angles are zero, so the total rotation is simply $R_z(\\phi)$.\nBy equating our derived $R_{\\mathcal{A}}$ with the general form $R_z(\\phi)$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathcal{A}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(\\phi) & -\\sin(\\phi) & 0 \\\\\n\\sin(\\phi) & \\cos(\\phi) & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nComparing the corresponding elements yields a system of two equations:\n1. $\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n2. $\\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}$\n\nBoth equations are satisfied simultaneously by the angle $\\phi$ in the first quadrant. The unique principal value for $\\phi$ that satisfies these conditions is:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\text{ radians}.\n$$\nThis is the signed yaw angle.",
