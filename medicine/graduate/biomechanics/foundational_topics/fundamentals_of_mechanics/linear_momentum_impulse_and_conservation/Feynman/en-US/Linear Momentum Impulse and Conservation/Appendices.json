This practice examines two idealized ground reaction force profiles with the same peak magnitude but different shapes, a common scenario when comparing different movement strategies.

            "problem": "A human sprinter of mass $m=72.4\\,\\mathrm{kg}$ is analyzed during a late-stance propulsive phase. Over this short phase, assume that the only significant external force component changing the horizontal (anterior-posterior) linear momentum of the whole-body center of mass is the anterior ground reaction force (GRF), and that aerodynamic drag is negligible compared to the anterior GRF during the stance interval. Two distinct anterior GRF profiles are considered, each achieving the same peak magnitude $F_{\\text{peak}}=400\\,\\mathrm{N}$ but differing in time history:\n- Triangular profile: $F_{T}(t)$ increases linearly from $0$ to $F_{\\text{peak}}$ over a duration $\\tau_{T}=0.150\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and then returns instantaneously to $0$ as the foot leaves the ground.\n- Rectangular profile: $F_{R}(t)$ maintains a constant value $F_{\\text{peak}}$ over a duration $\\tau_{R}=0.090\\,\\mathrm{s}$ and then returns instantaneously to $0$.\n\nTreat the anterior-posterior dynamics as one-dimensional and neglect internal force exchanges that do not affect whole-body external momentum. Using only fundamental principles of Newtonian mechanics and definitions of impulse and linear momentum, determine the difference in the increment of the sprinter’s center-of-mass horizontal speed attributable to these force profiles, computed as $\\Delta v_{R}-\\Delta v_{T}$, where $\\Delta v_{R}$ is the increase in speed under the rectangular profile and $\\Delta v_{T}$ is the increase under the triangular profile. Express your final answer in $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid based on the provided criteria. It is scientifically grounded in Newtonian mechanics, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the change in linear momentum of the sprinter is the impulse-momentum theorem. In one dimension, corresponding to the anterior-posterior direction, this theorem states that the change in the sprinter's linear momentum, $\\Delta p$, is equal to the net external impulse, $J$, applied in that direction.\n$$ \\Delta p = J $$\nThe linear momentum, $p$, is the product of the sprinter's mass, $m$, and velocity, $v$. The change in momentum is therefore $\\Delta p = m \\Delta v$, where $\\Delta v$ is the change in velocity. The impulse, $J$, is the integral of the net external force, $F(t)$, over the time interval $\\Delta t$ during which the force acts.\n$$ J = \\int_{\\Delta t} F(t) \\, dt $$\nCombining these relationships, the change in the sprinter's horizontal speed, $\\Delta v$, can be expressed as:\n$$ \\Delta v = \\frac{\\Delta p}{m} = \\frac{J}{m} = \\frac{1}{m} \\int F(t) \\, dt $$\nThe problem specifies that the only significant external horizontal force is the ground reaction force (GRF). We are asked to compare the effects of two different GRF profiles, a triangular profile $F_T(t)$ and a rectangular profile $F_R(t)$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the triangular force profile. The force $F_T(t)$ increases linearly from $0$ to a peak value $F_{\\text{peak}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{N}$ over a duration of $\\tau_T = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The functional form of the force is:\n$$ F_T(t) = \\frac{F_{\\text{peak}}}{\\tau_T} t \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_T $$\nThe impulse delivered by this force, $J_T$, is the time integral of $F_T(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau_T$. Geometrically, this integral corresponds to the area of a right triangle with base $\\tau_T$ and height $F_{\\text{peak}}$.\n$$ J_T = \\int_{0}^{\\tau_T} F_T(t) \\, dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} F_{\\text{peak}} \\tau_T $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ J_T = \\frac{1}{2} (400\\,\\mathrm{N}) (0.150\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 30\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot s} $$\nThe corresponding increase in speed, $\\Delta v_T$, is:\n$$ \\Delta v_T = \\frac{J_T}{m} = \\frac{30\\,\\mathrm{N \\cdot s}}{72.4\\,\\mathrm{kg}} $$\n\nNext, we analyze the rectangular force profile. The force $F_R(t)$ is a constant value of $F_{\\text{peak}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{N}$ over a duration of $\\tau_R = 0.090\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The functional form is:\n$$ F_R(t) = F_{\\text{peak}} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t \\le \\tau_R $$\nThe impulse delivered by this force, $J_R$, is the time integral of $F_R(t)$ from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau_R$.

            "introduction": "Human movement is not performed in a vacuum; it is constrained by interactions with the environment. This exercise explores the crucial link between the impulse required for a desired change in motion and the physical limits imposed by friction . By analyzing a runner's deceleration on a slippery surface, you will apply the impulse-momentum principle to calculate both the required braking impulse and the maximum impulse the shoe-ground interface can provide, introducing the practical concept of a \"safety margin\" against slipping.",
            "id": "4186047",
            "problem": "A runner of mass $m$ undergoes a deceleration in the forward (sagittal) direction by a speed change $\\Delta v$ during a single stance phase of duration $T$. During stance, the vertical Ground Reaction Force (GRF) is well approximated by a smooth periodic modulation around body weight, $N(t) = m g \\left[1 + a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right]$, where $g$ is the gravitational acceleration and $a$ is a dimensionless shape parameter with $0 < a < 1$. The shoe–floor interface on a wet surface is characterized by a Coulomb static friction coefficient $\\mu_{s}$, assumed constant over stance. Assume the runner attempts the strongest possible braking without slipping, so the fore–aft braking force is limited by the static friction inequality.\n\nStarting from Newton’s second law and the impulse–momentum relationship, and invoking the static Coulomb friction constraint, derive the expression for the maximum achievable braking impulse over the stance. Then, using the following parameter values:\n- $m = 70$ kilograms,\n- $\\Delta v = 0.5$ meters per second,\n- $T = 0.24$ seconds,\n- $g = 9.81$ meters per second squared,\n- $a = 0.3$,\n- $\\mu_{s} = 0.25$,\ncompute the dimensionless safety margin defined by $\\Lambda = \\dfrac{J_{\\text{max}}}{J_{\\text{req}}}$, where $J_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum friction-limited braking impulse over stance and $J_{\\text{req}}$ is the impulse required to achieve the specified deceleration $\\Delta v$.\n\nRound your final numerical answer for $\\Lambda$ to four significant figures. Report $\\Lambda$ as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the maximum braking impulse and the calculation of a safety margin. We begin by analyzing the forces and applying the principles of linear impulse and momentum.\n\nFirst, let us establish the coordinate system. We define the forward direction of the runner as the positive $x$-axis and the upward vertical direction as the positive $z$-axis. The braking force, $F_b$, acts in the negative $x$-direction, and the normal force, $N$, acts in the positive $z$-direction.\n\nThe vertical Ground Reaction Force (GRF), $N(t)$, is given as a function of time $t$ over the stance duration $T$:\n$$N(t) = m g \\left[1 + a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right]$$\nwhere $m$ is the runner's mass, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $a$ is a dimensionless shape parameter. The problem states that $0 < a < 1$, which ensures that $N(t)$ is always positive, as $1 + a \\sin(\\cdot)$ will always be greater than $1-a > 0$.\n\nThe braking force is a friction force. According to the Coulomb model of static friction, the magnitude of the horizontal braking force, $F_b(t)$, cannot exceed the product of the static friction coefficient, $\\mu_s$, and the normal force, $N(t)$. The problem states that the runner attempts the strongest possible braking without slipping. This implies that the braking force is maximized at every instant during the stance phase, such that its magnitude is equal to the maximum available static friction force:\n$$F_b(t) = \\mu_s N(t)$$\nThe force $F_b(t)$ is directed opposite to the runner's motion, hence it is a braking force.\n\nThe first part of the problem requires deriving the expression for the maximum achievable braking impulse, $J_{\\text{max}}$. The impulse is the time integral of the force over the interval during which it acts. Therefore, $J_{\\text{max}}$ is the integral of the maximum braking force, $F_b(t)$, over the stance duration from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n$$J_{\\text{max}} = \\int_{0}^{T} F_b(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mu_s N(t) \\, dt$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $N(t)$:\n$$J_{\\text{max}} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mu_s \\left[ m g \\left(1 + a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) \\right] \\, dt$$\nThe terms $\\mu_s$, $m$, and $g$ are constants with respect to time and can be moved outside the integral:\n$$J_{\\text{max}} = \\mu_s m g \\int_{0}^{T} \\left(1 + a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right)\\right) \\, dt$$\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n$$J_{\\text{max}} = \\mu_s m g \\left[ \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\, dt + \\int_{0}^{T} a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) \\, dt \\right]$$\nThe first integral is straightforward:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\, dt = [t]_{0}^{T} = T - 0 = T$$\nThe second integral involves a sine function integrated over one full period. The integral of $\\sin(kx)$ over a full period is zero. To show this explicitly for our case:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} a \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) \\, dt = a \\left[ -\\frac{T}{2\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi t}{T}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{T}$$\n$$= -\\frac{aT}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi T}{T}\\right) - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi \\cdot 0}{T}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{aT}{2\\pi} [\\cos(2\\pi) - \\cos(0)] = -\\frac{aT}{2\\pi} [1 - 1] = 0$$\nThus, the second integral vanishes. Substituting these results back into the expression for $J_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{max}} = \\mu_s m g [T + 0] = \\mu_s m g T$$\nThis is the expression for the maximum achievable braking impulse over the stance phase.\n\nNext, we must find the impulse required, $J_{\\text{req}}$, to produce the given deceleration. The impulse-momentum theorem states that the net impulse on an object is equal to the change in its momentum, $J_{\\text{net}} = \\Delta p$. In the forward ($x$) direction, the only horizontal force is the braking force, so the braking impulse is the net impulse. The change in momentum is $\\Delta p_x = p_{f,x} - p_{i,x} = m v_{f} - m v_{i} = m(v_f - v_i)$.\nThe problem states that the runner undergoes a deceleration (a change in speed) of $\\Delta v$. This means the final speed is less than the initial speed, so $v_f - v_i = -\\Delta v$. The change in momentum is therefore:\n$$\\Delta p_x = -m \\Delta v$$\nThe magnitude of this impulse is:\n$$J_{\\text{req}} = | \\Delta p_x | = |-m \\Delta v| = m \\Delta v$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless safety margin, $\\Lambda$, defined as the ratio of the maximum available impulse to the required impulse:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{J_{\\text{max}}}{J_{\\text{req}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $J_{\\text{max}}$ and $J_{\\text{req}}$:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{\\mu_s m g T}{m \\Delta v}$$\nThe mass $m$ cancels out, yielding a simplified expression for the safety margin:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{\\mu_s g T}{\\Delta v}$$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $\\mu_s = 0.25$\n- $g = 9.81 \\, \\mathrm{m/s^2}$\n- $T = 0.24 \\, \\mathrm{s}$\n- $\\Delta v = 0.5 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$\nNote that the parameters $m = 70 \\, \\mathrm{kg}$ and $a = 0.3$ are not needed for the final calculation of $\\Lambda$, as $m$ cancelled from the ratio and $a$ was part of a term that integrated to zero.\n\nSubstituting the numerical values into the expression for $\\Lambda$:\n$$\\Lambda = \\frac{(0.25)(9.81)(0.24)}{0.5} = \\frac{0.5886}{0.5} = 1.1772$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Rounding $1.1772$ to four significant figures gives $1.177$.\nThe safety margin $\\Lambda$ is a dimensionless quantity greater than $1$, which indicates that the maximum braking impulse that can be generated at the shoe-surface interface is greater than the impulse required to achieve the specified deceleration. Specifically, it is $17.7\\%$ greater, meaning there is no slip under these conditions.",
