It is based on standard, fundamental principles of PBPK modeling. The definitions of partition coefficient ($K_p$) and steady-state volume of distribution ($V_{ss}$) are standard in pharmacokinetics. The provided physiological volumes and partition coefficient values are explicitly stated to be plausible, and they are consistent with published literature for a typical adult human. The sum of all volumes ($3.0 + 18.0 + 28.0 + 1.5 + 0.3 + 1.4 + 1.0 + 18.8 = 72.0$ L) is a reasonable total body volume for a $70$ kg individual.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: The problem is directly relevant to PBPK modeling and is entirely formalizable using mathematical principles.\n3.  **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary data and definitions to derive the expression and compute the numerical result. There are no contradictions.\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The conditions and data are realistic within the context of pharmacokinetic modeling.\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and a path to a unique solution.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires a first-principles derivation and a multi-step calculation, which is a non-trivial exercise in applying pharmacokinetic theory.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The concepts are verifiable and form the basis of predictive pharmacology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, begins with the principle of mass balance. The total amount of drug in the body, $A_{\\text{body}}$, is the sum of the amount of drug in the plasma and the amounts in all tissues.\n\nLet $A_{p}$ be the amount of drug in the plasma and $A_{t,i}$ be the amount of drug in tissue $i$. The total amount is:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = A_{p} + \\sum_{i} A_{t,i}$$\nwhere the sum is over all tissues $i$ in the model.\n\nThe amount of drug in a compartment is the product of its volume and the drug concentration within it.\nThe amount in plasma is $A_{p} = V_{p} C_{p}$.\nThe amount in tissue $i$ is $A_{t,i} = V_{i} C_{t,i}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = V_{p} C_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} C_{t,i}$$\n\nThe problem states that at equilibrium, the tissue concentration $C_{t,i}$ is related to the plasma concentration $C_{p}$ by the tissue-to-plasma partition coefficient $K_{p,i}$:\n$$C_{t,i} = K_{p,i} C_{p}$$\nThis relationship is a direct consequence of the steady-state assumption, which we will revisit later. Substituting this expression for $C_{t,i}$ into the mass balance equation:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = V_{p} C_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} (K_{p,i} C_{p})$$\n\nWe can factor out the common term $C_{p}$ from the right-hand side:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = C_{p} \\left( V_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i} \\right)$$\n\nThe steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, is defined as the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration at steady state:\n$$V_{ss} = \\frac{A_{\\text{body}}}{C_{p}}$$\n\nSubstituting our expression for $A_{\\text{body}}$:\n$$V_{ss} = \\frac{C_{p} \\left( V_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i} \\right)}{C_{p}}$$\n\nCanceling $C_{p}$ yields the final expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = V_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i}$$\n\nNow, we explain why tissue perfusion rates do not appear in this equation. The steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, is a thermodynamic parameter that describes the extent of drug distribution once an equilibrium (or steady state) has been achieved. At steady state, by definition, the net rate of change of drug concentration in each tissue compartment is zero. The mass balance for a perfusion-limited tissue is typically written as:\n$$V_i \\frac{dC_{t,i}}{dt} = Q_i (C_{\\text{art}} - C_{v,i})$$\nwhere $Q_i$ is the blood flow (perfusion) rate to tissue $i$, $C_{\\text{art}}$ is the arterial plasma concentration, and $C_{v,i}$ is the venous plasma concentration leaving the tissue. At steady state, $\\frac{dC_{t,i}}{dt} = 0$, which implies $Q_i(C_{\\text{art}} - C_{v,i}) = 0$. Since $Q_i > 0$, we must have $C_{\\text{art}} = C_{v,i}$. Furthermore, at steady state, the arterial plasma concentration is equal to the systemic plasma concentration, $C_p$. The venous effluent is assumed to be in equilibrium with the tissue, such that $C_{v,i} = C_{t,i} / K_{p,i}$. Combining these equalities gives $C_p = C_{t,i} / K_{p,i}$, which is the starting relationship $C_{t,i} = K_{p,i} C_p$. The perfusion rate $Q_i$ is a kinetic parameter that governs how *fast* this steady state is reached, but it does not influence the state itself. Therefore, $Q_i$ drops out of the steady-state equations, and $V_{ss}$ depends only on volumes ($V_p$, $V_i$) and thermodynamic partition coefficients ($K_{p,i}$).\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $V_{ss}$. We must calculate the sum of the products $V_{i} K_{p,i}$ for each tissue. The tissues are indexed as adipose (ad), muscle (mu), liver (li), kidney (ki), brain (br), lung (lu), and rest-of-body (re).\n\n$\\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i} = (V_{\\text{ad}} K_{p,\\text{ad}}) + (V_{\\text{mu}} K_{p,\\text{mu}}) + (V_{\\text{li}} K_{p,\\text{li}}) + (V_{\\text{ki}} K_{p,\\text{ki}}) + (V_{\\text{br}} K_{p,\\text{br}}) + (V_{\\text{lu}} K_{p,\\text{lu}}) + (V_{\\text{re}} K_{p,\\text{re}})$\n\nCalculating each term:\n- Adipose: $18.0 \\, \\text{L} \\times 12.0 = 216.0 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Muscle: $28.0 \\, \\text{L} \\times 3.0 = 84.0 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Liver: $1.5 \\, \\text{L} \\times 5.0 = 7.5 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Kidney: $0.3 \\, \\text{L} \\times 2.5 = 0.75 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Brain: $1.4 \\, \\text{L} \\times 0.8 = 1.12 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Lung: $1.0 \\, \\text{L} \\times 1.5 = 1.5 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Rest-of-body: $18.8 \\, \\text{L} \\times 2.0 = 37.6 \\, \\text{L}$\n\nSumming these contributions:\n$\\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i} = 216.0 + 84.0 + 7.5 + 0.75 + 1.12 + 1.5 + 37.6 = 348.47 \\, \\text{L}$\n\nNow, we calculate $V_{ss}$ using the derived formula:\n$V_{ss} = V_{p} + \\sum_{i} V_{i} K_{p,i}$\nGiven $V_{p} = 3.0 \\, \\text{L}$:\n$V_{ss} = 3.0 \\, \\text{L} + 348.47 \\, \\text{L} = 351.47 \\, \\text{L}$\n\nThe problem asks to round the final answer to four significant figures, which gives $351.5 \\, \\text{L}$.\n\nFinally, we identify the tissues that dominate $V_{ss}$. The contribution of each tissue to the volume of distribution is given by the term $V_{i} K_{p,i}$.\n- Adipose: $216.0 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Muscle: $84.0 \\, \\text{L}$\n- Rest-of-body: $37.6 \\, \\text{L}$\nThe other tissues contribute much smaller amounts: liver ($7.5 \\, \\text{L}$), lung ($1.5 \\, \\text{L}$), brain ($1.12 \\, \\text{L}$), and kidney ($0.75 \\, \\text{L}$).\nClearly, the adipose tissue is the single largest contributor, accounting for $\\frac{216.0}{351.47} \\approx 61.5\\%$ of the total $V_{ss}$. Muscle is the second-largest contributor, accounting for $\\frac{84.0}{351.47} \\approx 23.9\\%$. Together, adipose and muscle tissue are responsible for over $85\\%$ of the total steady-state volume of distribution. This is due to a combination of large volume ($V_i$) and/or high partition coefficient ($K_{p,i}$). Adipose tissue dominates because of its very high partition coefficient ($K_{p,\\text{adipose}} = 12.0$) and large volume ($V_{\\text{adipose}} = 18.0 \\, \\text{L}$). Muscle tissue is a major contributor primarily due to its very large volume ($V_{\\text{muscle}} = 28.0 \\, \\text{L}$), even with a more moderate partition coefficient.\nThe problem mentions that some tissues are \"poorly perfused\" and others \"highly perfused\". As explained, this distinction is irrelevant for the calculation of $V_{ss}$, although it is critically important for determining the time-course of drug distribution.",

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Outlet Concentration Equations\n\n**1. Parallel-Tube (Plug-Flow) Model**\n\nIn this model, the liver is conceptualized as a single tube through which blood flows without axial mixing. The drug concentration, $C$, varies with position along the length of the tube. We perform a mass balance on a differential volume element $dV_H$ of the liver at steady state.\n\nThe change in the mass flow rate of the drug across this element must equal the rate of elimination within it.\n$$\n(\\text{Flow rate in}) - (\\text{Flow rate out}) - (\\text{Rate of elimination}) = 0\n$$\nLet $C(z)$ be the total drug concentration at a fractional distance $z$ along the tube (from $z=0$ to $z=1$). The flow rate into the differential element at $z$ is $Q_H C(z)$, and the flow out at $z+dz$ is $Q_H C(z+dz)$. The rate of elimination in the differential element $dV_H$ is given by the product of the intrinsic clearance rate and the local unbound drug concentration within that element's volume, represented as $CL_{int} (f_{u,p} C(z)) dz$.\n$$\nQ_H C(z) - Q_H C(z+dz) - CL_{int} (f_{u,p} C(z)) dz = 0\n$$\nUsing the definition of the derivative, $C(z+dz) = C(z) + \\frac{dC}{dz}dz$, we get:\n$$\nQ_H C(z) - Q_H \\left(C(z) + \\frac{dC}{dz}dz\\right) - f_{u,p} CL_{int} C(z) dz = 0\n$$\n$$\n-Q_H \\frac{dC}{dz}dz = f_{u,p} CL_{int} C(z) dz\n$$\nThis simplifies to the ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{C} = -\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H} dz\n$$\nWe integrate this equation along the length of the tube from the inlet ($z=0$, $C=C_{in}$) to the outlet ($z=1$, $C=C_{out}$):\n$$\n\\int_{C_{in}}^{C_{out}} \\frac{dC}{C} = -\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H} \\int_0^1 dz\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C)\\Big|_{C_{in}}^{C_{out}} = -\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H} [z]\\Big|_0^1\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(C_{out}) - \\ln(C_{in}) = -\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H}\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{out}}{C_{in}}\\right) = -\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{out}$ gives the expression for the parallel-tube model:\n$$\nC_{out,\\mathrm{tube}} = C_{in} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H}\\right)\n$$\n\n**2. Well-Stirred Model**\n\nIn this model, the liver is treated as a single, perfectly mixed compartment. The drug concentration within the liver is uniform and assumed to be equal to the concentration in the blood leaving the liver, $C_{out}$. The unbound concentration driving metabolism throughout the organ is therefore $C_{u,out} = f_{u,p} C_{out}$.\n\nThe steady-state mass balance equation is:\n$$\n(\\text{Rate of drug in}) = (\\text{Rate of drug out}) + (\\text{Rate of drug elimination})\n$$\nThe terms are defined as:\n- Rate of drug in: $Q_H C_{in}$\n- Rate of drug out: $Q_H C_{out}$\n- Rate of drug elimination: This is the product of intrinsic clearance and the uniform unbound concentration in the liver, which is $CL_{int} \\times C_{u,out} = CL_{int} f_{u,p} C_{out}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the mass balance equation:\n$$\nQ_H C_{in} = Q_H C_{out} + f_{u,p} CL_{int} C_{out}\n$$\nWe solve for $C_{out}$ by factoring it from the right-hand side:\n$$\nQ_H C_{in} = C_{out} (Q_H + f_{u,p} CL_{int})\n$$\nThis gives the expression for the well-stirred model:\n$$\nC_{out,\\mathrm{ws}} = \\frac{Q_H C_{in}}{Q_H + f_{u,p} CL_{int}} = C_{in} \\left(\\frac{Q_H}{Q_H + f_{u,p} CL_{int}}\\right) = C_{in} \\left(\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H}}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Calculations\n\nFor convenience, we define a dimensionless number $X = \\frac{f_{u,p} CL_{int}}{Q_H}$.\nThe equations become:\n- $C_{out,\\mathrm{tube}} = C_{in} \\exp(-X)$\n- $C_{out,\\mathrm{ws}} = C_{in} (1 + X)^{-1}$\n\nThe given parameters are $C_{in} = 10\\,\\mathrm{\\mu M}$ and $Q_H = 1.5\\,\\mathrm{L\\,min^{-1}}$.\n\n**A.

Your implementation must begin from first principles: the definition of a partition coefficient as an equilibrium ratio of concentrations, thermodynamic equality of free drug concentrations across aqueous phases, mass balance, and the interpretation of the systemic volume of distribution at steady state as the aggregate consequence of tissue drug storage relative to plasma.\n\nDefinitions, assumptions, and constants:\n- Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a mechanistic framework that represents the body as interconnected anatomical and physiological compartments and relates drug disposition to tissue properties. The tissue-plasma partition coefficient $K_p$ is defined as $K_p = C_{\\text{tissue}} / C_{\\text{plasma}}$ at equilibrium, where $C_{\\text{tissue}}$ and $C_{\\text{plasma}}$ denote total drug concentrations in tissue and plasma, respectively.\n- The Volume of Distribution at Steady State ($V_{ss}$) is defined as the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body to the plasma concentration at steady state, arising from mass balance across all tissues and plasma under linear equilibrium distribution.\n- Consider a neutral compound for which the free (unbound) concentration in the aqueous phases is equal at equilibrium. Let the plasma unbound fraction be $f_{u,p}$, and the base-$10$ distribution coefficient between a representative neutral lipid and water be $P = 10^{\\log D}$, where $\\log D$ is the base-$10$ logarithm of the distribution coefficient at a specified pH. Assume linear binding and distribution.\n- The body is represented by two tissue compartments and one plasma compartment. The two tissue compartments are “fat” and “lean” tissues. Plasma is treated as a single compartment.\n- Let the fractional compositions of the tissues be constants that do not change with total fat mass fraction. Denote the effective water fraction in fat as $\\phi_{\\text{fat},w}$ and the effective neutral lipid fraction in fat as $\\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell}$. Similarly, denote the effective water fraction in lean tissue as $\\phi_{\\text{lean},w}$ and the effective neutral lipid fraction in lean tissue as $\\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell}$. For scientific realism, use $\\phi_{\\text{fat},w} = 0.20$, $\\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell} = 0.80$, $\\phi_{\\text{lean},w} = 0.75$, $\\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell} = 0.05$.\n- Let the densities be $\\rho_{\\text{fat}} = 0.90$ in $\\mathrm{kg/L}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{lean}} = 1.06$ in $\\mathrm{kg/L}$. Let the plasma volume per unit body weight be $v_{\\text{plasma}} = 0.04$ in $\\mathrm{L/kg}$.\n- Let body weight be $BW$ in $\\mathrm{kg}$ and the fat mass fraction be $f_{\\text{fat}}$ (dimensionless). Then the tissue volumes are $V_{\\text{fat}}$ and $V_{\\text{lean}}$ in $\\mathrm{L}$, and plasma volume is $V_{\\text{plasma}}$ in $\\mathrm{L}$. All algorithmic derivations must be based on the equilibrium relationships and mass balance, not on pre-specified shortcut formulas.\n\nYour tasks:\n1. From the fundamental definitions described above, derive mathematically and then implement the expressions required to compute the tissue-plasma partition coefficients for fat and lean tissues, denoted $K_{p,\\text{fat}}$ and $K_{p,\\text{lean}}$ (dimensionless), and the systemic volume of distribution at steady state $V_{ss}$ in $\\mathrm{L}$ for a neutral compound with the parameters provided.\n2. Using differential analysis from first principles, derive and implement the normalized sensitivity coefficients of $V_{ss}$ with respect to the fat mass fraction $f_{\\text{fat}}$, the plasma unbound fraction $f_{u,p}$, and $\\log D$. For a variable $x$, the normalized sensitivity should be computed as $S_x = \\left(\\dfrac{x}{V_{ss}}\\right)\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial x}\\right)$. Report sensitivities as dimensionless floats.\n3. Identify the dominant driver among the three variables by comparing the absolute values of their normalized sensitivities and returning the index of the largest absolute sensitivity. Use the following index mapping: $0$ corresponds to $f_{\\text{fat}}$, $1$ corresponds to $f_{u,p}$, and $2$ corresponds to $\\log D$.\n4. Implement the computation for the following test suite of parameter values. Each test case is a tuple $(BW, f_{\\text{fat}}, f_{u,p}, \\log D)$:\n   - Test $1$: $(70, 0.25, 0.10, 2.0)$\n   - Test $2$: $(70, 0.05, 0.80, -0.5)$\n   - Test $3$: $(110, 0.45, 0.05, 3.0)$\n   - Test $4$: $(55, 0.01, 0.50, -2.0)$\n5. For each test case, produce a result list containing $[K_{p,\\text{fat}}, K_{p,\\text{lean}}, V_{ss}, S_{f_{\\text{fat}}}, S_{f_{u,p}}, S_{\\log D}, \\text{driver\\_index}]$. Here, $V_{ss}$ must be expressed in $\\mathrm{L}$, and all other quantities are dimensionless floats except for $\\text{driver\\_index}$, which is an integer.\n6. Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where the list elements are themselves lists for each test case, for example, $[[\\cdots],[\\cdots],[\\cdots],[\\cdots]]$. There must be no spaces anywhere in the printed output line.\n\nScientific realism requirements:\n- Ensure that your derivation and implementation strictly adhere to the first-principles definitions listed above, without reliance on or reproduction of any pre-specified shortcut formulas.\n- The computations must be internally self-consistent and physically plausible under the stated assumptions.\n\nYour program must be self-contained, must not read any external input, and must produce exactly the single line specified. All numerical answers must be floats or integers as specified. $K_{p,\\text{fat}}$ and $K_{p,\\text{lean}}$ are dimensionless. $V_{ss}$ must be reported in $\\mathrm{L}$. Sensitivities are dimensionless. Angles are not involved in this problem. Percentages must be treated as decimals (for example, $0.25$ for $25\\%$).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a physiological-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to analyze the effect of body composition on drug distribution. The derivation will proceed from first principles as stipulated.\n\n### 1. Derivation of Compartment Volumes\n\nThe model considers the body to be composed of three compartments: fat tissue, lean tissue, and plasma. The volumes of these compartments are derived from the total body weight ($BW$) and the fat mass fraction ($f_{\\text{fat}}$).\n\nThe mass of fat is $M_{\\text{fat}} = f_{\\text{fat}} \\cdot BW$.\nThe mass of the remaining tissue, designated as lean tissue, is $M_{\\text{lean}} = (1 - f_{\\text{fat}}) \\cdot BW$.\n\nGiven the densities $\\rho_{\\text{fat}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{lean}}$ in units of mass per volume ($\\mathrm{kg/L}$), the volumes of the fat and lean tissue compartments are:\n$$V_{\\text{fat}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{fat}}}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{fat}} \\cdot BW}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}}$$\n$$V_{\\text{lean}} = \\frac{M_{\\text{lean}}}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}} = \\frac{(1 - f_{\\text{fat}}) \\cdot BW}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}}$$\n\nThe plasma volume, $V_{\\text{plasma}}$, is given as a fixed fraction of body weight, $v_{\\text{plasma}}$, in units of volume per mass ($\\mathrm{L/kg}$):\n$$V_{\\text{plasma}} = v_{\\text{plasma}} \\cdot BW$$\n\n### 2. Derivation of the Tissue-Plasma Partition Coefficient ($K_p$)\n\nThe tissue-plasma partition coefficient for a given tissue $T$, denoted $K_{p,T}$, is defined as the ratio of total drug concentration in the tissue ($C_T$) to the total drug concentration in plasma ($C_{\\text{plasma}}$) at equilibrium:\n$$K_{p,T} = \\frac{C_T}{C_{\\text{plasma}}}$$\nThe total concentration in tissue $T$ is the total amount of drug in the tissue, $A_T$, divided by the tissue volume, $V_T$. The amount $A_T$ is the sum of drug in the tissue's aqueous and lipid phases:\n$$C_T = \\frac{A_T}{V_T} = \\frac{C_{T,w} V_{T,w} + C_{T,\\ell} V_{T,\\ell}}{V_T}$$\nwhere $C_{T,w}$ and $C_{T,\\ell}$ are drug concentrations in the tissue's water and lipid phases, and $V_{T,w}$ and $V_{T,\\ell}$ are the volumes of these phases. These volumes are defined by the tissue's fractional composition: $V_{T,w} = \\phi_{T,w} V_T$ and $V_{T,\\ell} = \\phi_{T,\\ell} V_T$. Substituting these gives:\n$$C_T = C_{T,w} \\phi_{T,w} + C_{T,\\ell} \\phi_{T,\\ell}$$\nA core assumption is that at equilibrium, the free (unbound) drug concentration, $C_u$, is uniform across all aqueous phases. The plasma unbound concentration is $C_{u,p} = f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}}$. We equate this with the unbound concentration in tissue water, $C_{T,w}$:\n$$C_{T,w} = C_u = f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}}$$\nThe neutral lipid-water distribution coefficient, $P$, is the ratio of concentrations in the lipid phase to the aqueous phase: $P = C_{T,\\ell} / C_{T,w}$. This implies $C_{T,\\ell} = P \\cdot C_{T,w}$. Substituting the expression for $C_{T,w}$:\n$$C_{T,\\ell} = P \\cdot f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}}$$\nWith $P = 10^{\\log D}$.\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $C_{T,w}$ and $C_{T,\\ell}$ back into the equation for $C_T$:\n$$C_T = (f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}}) \\phi_{T,w} + (P \\cdot f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}}) \\phi_{T,\\ell}$$\n$$C_T = f_{u,p} C_{\\text{plasma}} (\\phi_{T,w} + P \\phi_{T,\\ell})$$\nFinally, by dividing by $C_{\\text{plasma}}$, we obtain the general expression for $K_{p,T}$:\n$$K_{p,T} = \\frac{C_T}{C_{\\text{plasma}}} = f_{u,p} (\\phi_{T,w} + P \\phi_{T,\\ell})$$\nApplying this to fat and lean tissues with their specific compositions:\n$$K_{p,\\text{fat}} = f_{u,p} (\\phi_{\\text{fat},w} + 10^{\\log D} \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell})$$\n$$K_{p,\\text{lean}} = f_{u,p} (\\phi_{\\text{lean},w} + 10^{\\log D} \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell})$$\n\n### 3. Derivation of the Volume of Distribution at Steady State ($V_{ss}$)\n\n$V_{ss}$ is the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body ($A_{\\text{body}}$) to the plasma drug concentration at steady state.\n$$V_{ss} = \\frac{A_{\\text{body}}}{C_{\\text{plasma}}}$$\nThe total amount of drug is the sum of the amounts in each compartment:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = A_{\\text{plasma}} + A_{\\text{fat}} + A_{\\text{lean}}$$\nEach tissue amount is the product of its concentration and volume, e.g., $A_{\\text{fat}} = C_{\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}}$. Using the definition of $K_p$, we have $C_{\\text{fat}} = K_{p,\\text{fat}} C_{\\text{plasma}}$ and $C_{\\text{lean}} = K_{p,\\text{lean}} C_{\\text{plasma}}$.\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = (C_{\\text{plasma}} V_{\\text{plasma}}) + (K_{p,\\text{fat}} C_{\\text{plasma}} V_{\\text{fat}}) + (K_{p,\\text{lean}} C_{\\text{plasma}} V_{\\text{lean}})$$\nFactoring out $C_{\\text{plasma}}$:\n$$A_{\\text{body}} = C_{\\text{plasma}} (V_{\\text{plasma}} + K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}})$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = V_{\\text{plasma}} + K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}}$$\n\n### 4. Derivation of Normalized Sensitivity Coefficients\n\nThe normalized sensitivity of $V_{ss}$ with respect to a parameter $x$ is $S_x = \\left(\\frac{x}{V_{ss}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial x}\\right)$.\n\n**a. Sensitivity to Fat Mass Fraction ($f_{\\text{fat}}$):**\nFirst, we find the partial derivative of $V_{ss}$ with respect to $f_{\\text{fat}}$.\n$$V_{ss}(f_{\\text{fat}}) = V_{\\text{plasma}} + K_{p,\\text{fat}} \\frac{f_{\\text{fat}} \\cdot BW}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} \\frac{(1 - f_{\\text{fat}}) \\cdot BW}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}}$$\nThe terms $V_{\\text{plasma}}$, $K_{p,\\text{fat}}$, and $K_{p,\\text{lean}}$ do not depend on $f_{\\text{fat}}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial f_{\\text{fat}}} = \\frac{K_{p,\\text{fat}} BW}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}} - \\frac{K_{p,\\text{lean}} BW}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}} = BW \\left(\\frac{K_{p,\\text{fat}}}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}} - \\frac{K_{p,\\text{lean}}}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}}\\right)$$\nThe normalized sensitivity is:\n$$S_{f_{\\text{fat}}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{fat}}}{V_{ss}} \\cdot BW \\left(\\frac{K_{p,\\text{fat}}}{\\rho_{\\text{fat}}} - \\frac{K_{p,\\text{lean}}}{\\rho_{\\text{lean}}}\\right)$$\n\n**b. Sensitivity to Plasma Unbound Fraction ($f_{u,p}$):**\n$K_p$ values are directly proportional to $f_{u,p}$.\n$$V_{ss}(f_{u,p}) = V_{\\text{plasma}} + f_{u,p} (\\phi_{\\text{fat},w} + P \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell}) V_{\\text{fat}} + f_{u,p} (\\phi_{\\text{lean},w} + P \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell}) V_{\\text{lean}}$$\nTaking the derivative:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial f_{u,p}} = (\\phi_{\\text{fat},w} + P \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell}) V_{\\text{fat}} + (\\phi_{\\text{lean},w} + P \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell}) V_{\\text{lean}}$$\nRecalling $K_{p,T} = f_{u,p} (\\phi_{T,w} + P \\phi_{T,\\ell})$, we have $\\frac{K_{p,T}}{f_{u,p}} = (\\phi_{T,w} + P \\phi_{T,\\ell})$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial f_{u,p}} = \\frac{K_{p,\\text{fat}}}{f_{u,p}} V_{\\text{fat}} + \\frac{K_{p,\\text{lean}}}{f_{u,p}} V_{\\text{lean}} = \\frac{1}{f_{u,p}} (K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}})$$\nThe sensitivity is:\n$$S_{f_{u,p}} = \\frac{f_{u,p}}{V_{ss}} \\frac{1}{f_{u,p}} (K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}}) = \\frac{K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}}}{V_{ss}}$$\nSince $V_{ss} = V_{\\text{plasma}} + K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}}$, this simplifies to:\n$$S_{f_{u,p}} = \\frac{V_{ss} - V_{\\text{plasma}}}{V_{ss}} = 1 - \\frac{V_{\\text{plasma}}}{V_{ss}}$$\n\n**c. Sensitivity to $\\log D$:**\nWe use the chain rule: $\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial \\log D} = \\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial P} \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\log D}$.\nFirst, $P = 10^{\\log D} = e^{\\ln(10) \\cdot \\log D}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\log D} = e^{\\ln(10) \\cdot \\log D} \\cdot \\ln(10) = P \\cdot \\ln(10)$$\nNext, we find $\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial P}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left( V_{\\text{plasma}} + K_{p,\\text{fat}} V_{\\text{fat}} + K_{p,\\text{lean}} V_{\\text{lean}} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial P} = \\frac{\\partial K_{p,\\text{fat}}}{\\partial P} V_{\\text{fat}} + \\frac{\\partial K_{p,\\text{lean}}}{\\partial P} V_{\\text{lean}}$$\nFrom $K_{p,T} = f_{u,p} (\\phi_{T,w} + P \\phi_{T,\\ell})$, we get $\\frac{\\partial K_{p,T}}{\\partial P} = f_{u,p} \\phi_{T,\\ell}$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial P} = (f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell}) V_{\\text{fat}} + (f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell}) V_{\\text{lean}}$$\nCombining the parts:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_{ss}}{\\partial \\log D} = \\left( f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell} V_{\\text{fat}} + f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell} V_{\\text{lean}} \\right) P \\ln(10)$$\nThe normalized sensitivity is:\n$$S_{\\log D} = \\frac{\\log D}{V_{ss}} \\left( f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{fat},\\ell} V_{\\text{fat}} + f_{u,p} \\phi_{\\text{lean},\\ell} V_{\\text{lean}} \\right) P \\ln(10)$$\n\n### 5. Identification of the Dominant Driver\nThe dominant driver of variability in $V_{ss}$ among $f_{\\text{fat}}$, $f_{u,p}$, and $\\log D$ is identified by finding which of the three corresponding normalized sensitivity coefficients ($S_{f_{\\text{fat}}}, S_{f_{u,p}}, S_{\\log D}$) has the largest absolute value. The index of this parameter ($0$ for $f_{\\text{fat}}$, $1$ for $f_{u,p}$, $2$ for $\\log D$) is reported.",
