            "problem": "A passive dendritic segment is modeled by two complementary descriptions: (i) a local isopotential patch for temporal dynamics, where the membrane obeys current conservation such that the sum of capacitive current and leak current equals the injected current, and (ii) a uniform, semi-infinite cylindrical cable for spatial spread, where axial current flows according to Ohm’s law and the membrane leak is distributed along the cable. Assume a linear, subthreshold regime with no voltage-dependent conductances, and let the specific membrane resistance be $R_m$ (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$), the specific membrane capacitance be $C_m$ (in $\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}^2$), the axial resistivity be $R_i$ (in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$), and the dendritic radius be $a$ (in $\\mathrm{m}$).

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a standard, formalizable problem in passive cable theory, a fundamental topic in biomedical systems modeling and computational neuroscience. All necessary parameters and physical laws are stated, and the question is unambiguous. The problem is valid, and I will proceed to derive a solution from the provided first principles.\n\nThe solution is structured as follows: First, I will derive the expressions for the three key quantities—membrane time constant ($\\tau_m$), synaptic integration bandwidth ($f_c$), and steady-state electrotonic length constant ($\\lambda$)—from the stated principles. Second, I will analyze the effects of manipulations $\\mathrm{M1}$ and $\\mathrm{M2}$ on these quantities. Finally, I will evaluate each option against these derived results.\n\n**1. Derivation of Fundamental Quantities**\n\n**a. Membrane Time Constant ($\\tau_m$)**\nThe problem describes a local isopotential patch where current conservation holds: the injected current ($I_{inj}$) equals the sum of capacitive current ($I_C$) and leak current ($I_L$).\nFor a patch of membrane with total capacitance $C$ and total resistance $R$, the currents are given by:\n- Capacitive current: $I_C = C \\frac{dV_m}{dt}$, where $V_m$ is the membrane potential.\n- Leak current: $I_L = \\frac{V_m}{R}$, assuming the resting potential is $0$.\n\nThe current conservation equation is:\n$$I_{inj} = I_C + I_L = C \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + \\frac{V_m}{R}$$\nThis can be rearranged into the standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$RC \\frac{dV_m}{dt} + V_m = R \\cdot I_{inj}$$\nThe term $RC$ is the membrane time constant, $\\tau_m$.\nThe parameters $R$ and $C$ are related to the specific membrane properties ($R_m$, $C_m$) and the area of the patch, $A$.\n- Total resistance $R = R_m / A$ (units: $\\Omega = (\\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2) / \\mathrm{m}^2$).\n- Total capacitance $C = C_m \\cdot A$ (units: $\\mathrm{F} = (\\mathrm{F} / \\mathrm{m}^2) \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2$).\nThe time constant is therefore independent of the patch area:\n$$\\tau_m = RC = \\left(\\frac{R_m}{A}\\right) (C_m A) = R_m C_m$$\n\n**b. Synaptic Integration Bandwidth ($f_c$)**\nThe bandwidth is defined as the $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ cutoff frequency of the local response to a sinusoidal input current. We analyze the system's transfer function in the frequency domain. Let $V_m(\\omega)$ and $I_{inj}(\\omega)$ be the Fourier transforms of the voltage and current, respectively. The differential operator $\\frac{d}{dt}$ becomes multiplication by $j\\omega$. The governing equation transforms to:\n$$j\\omega \\tau_m V_m(\\omega) + V_m(\\omega) = R \\cdot I_{inj}(\\omega)$$\nThe transfer function $H(\\omega) = \\frac{V_m(\\omega)}{I_{inj}(\\omega)}$ is:\n$$H(\\omega) = \\frac{R}{1 + j\\omega \\tau_m}$$\nThe magnitude of the frequency response is $|H(\\omega)| = \\frac{|R|}{|1 + j\\omega \\tau_m|} = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega \\tau_m)^2}}$.\nThe $-3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$ point is where the power drops by half, or the magnitude drops to $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of its maximum (DC, $\\omega=0$) value. The maximum magnitude is $|H(0)| = R$.\nWe set $|H(\\omega_c)| = \\frac{|H(0)|}{\\sqrt{2}}$:\n$$\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{1 + (\\omega_c \\tau_m)^2}} = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n$$1 + (\\omega_c \\tau_m)^2 = 2 \\implies (\\omega_c \\tau_m)^2 = 1 \\implies \\omega_c \\tau_m = 1$$\nThe cutoff angular frequency is $\\omega_c = 1/\\tau_m$. The cutoff frequency in Hertz is $f_c = \\omega_c / (2\\pi) = 1/(2\\pi \\tau_m)$.\nThus, the synaptic integration bandwidth is inversely proportional to the membrane time constant:\n$$f_c \\propto \\frac{1}{\\tau_m}$$\n\n**c. Steady-State Electrotonic Length Constant ($\\lambda$)**\nFor spatial spread in a uniform cable, we use the cable equation derived from Ohm's law for axial current and the distributed leak. We need to find the expressions for membrane resistance per unit length ($r_m$) and axial resistance per unit length ($r_i$). For a cylinder of radius $a$:\n- The circumference is $2\\pi a$. The membrane resistance per unit length is $r_m = R_m / (2\\pi a)$ (units: $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$).\n- The cross-sectional area is $\\pi a^2$. The axial resistance per unit length is $r_i = R_i / (\\pi a^2)$ (units: $\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}$).\nThe steady-state electrotonic length constant, $\\lambda$, is defined as:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_i$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m/(2\\pi a)}{R_i/(\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 R_i}}$$\nThis expression for $\\lambda$ does not depend on the specific membrane capacitance $C_m$, as capacitance is irrelevant at steady state ($\\partial/\\partial t = 0$).\n\n**2. Analysis of Manipulations**\n\n**Manipulation M1: $C_m \\rightarrow C_m' = C_m/2$; $R_m$ unchanged.**\n- **Time Constant:** $\\tau_m' = R_m C_m' = R_m (C_m/2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\tau_m$. The time constant is halved.\n- **Bandwidth:** $f_c' \\propto 1/\\tau_m' = 1/(\\frac{1}{2}\\tau_m) = 2(1/\\tau_m) \\propto 2f_c$. The bandwidth is doubled.\n- **Length Constant:** $\\lambda' = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 R_i}}$. This is unchanged as it does not depend on $C_m$.\n\n**Manipulation M2: $R_m \\rightarrow R_m'' = 2R_m$; $C_m$ unchanged.**\n- **Time Constant:** $\\tau_m'' = R_m'' C_m = (2R_m) C_m = 2\\tau_m$. The time constant is doubled.\n- **Bandwidth:** $f_c'' \\propto 1/\\tau_m'' = 1/(2\\tau_m) \\propto \\frac{1}{2}f_c$. The bandwidth is halved.\n- **Length Constant:** $\\lambda'' = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m'' a}{2 R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2R_m) a}{2 R_i}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m a}{2 R_i}} = \\sqrt{2}\\lambda$. The length constant increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Under $\\mathrm{M1}$, the membrane time constant is halved, the synaptic integration bandwidth is doubled, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant is unchanged; under $\\mathrm{M2}$, the membrane time constant is doubled, the synaptic integration bandwidth is halved, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.**\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M1}$: Time constant halved (Correct). Bandwidth doubled (Correct). Length constant unchanged (Correct).\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M2}$: Time constant doubled (Correct). Bandwidth halved (Correct). Length constant increases by $\\sqrt{2}$ (Correct).\nAll statements in this option are consistent with our derivations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under $\\mathrm{M1}$, the membrane time constant is halved, the synaptic integration bandwidth is halved, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant decreases by a factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$; under $\\mathrm{M2}$, the membrane time constant is doubled, the synaptic integration bandwidth is doubled, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant is unchanged.**\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M1}$: Bandwidth is halved (Incorrect, it is doubled). Length constant decreases (Incorrect, it is unchanged).\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M2}$: Bandwidth is doubled (Incorrect, it is halved). Length constant is unchanged (Incorrect, it increases by $\\sqrt{2}$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both $\\mathrm{M1}$ and $\\mathrm{M2}$ leave the membrane time constant unchanged because the effects of $C_m$ and $R_m$ cancel; therefore, the synaptic integration bandwidth is unchanged in both cases; under $\\mathrm{M2}$, the steady-state electrotonic length constant increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$.**\n- The initial premise that $\\tau_m = R_m C_m$ is unchanged by either manipulation is fundamentally false. $\\mathrm{M1}$ halves $\\tau_m$, and $\\mathrm{M2}$ doubles $\\tau_m$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Under $\\mathrm{M1}$, the membrane time constant is doubled due to faster charging, the synaptic integration bandwidth is halved, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant increases; under $\\mathrm{M2}$, the membrane time constant is halved, the synaptic integration bandwidth is doubled, and the steady-state electrotonic length constant decreases.**\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M1}$: Time constant is doubled (Incorrect, it is halved). The rationale is also flawed: \"faster charging\" corresponds to a *smaller* time constant. Bandwidth is halved (Incorrect, it is doubled). Length constant increases (Incorrect, it is unchanged).\n- Analysis of $\\mathrm{M2}$: Time constant is halved (Incorrect, it is doubled). Bandwidth is doubled (Incorrect, it is halved). Length constant decreases (Incorrect, it increases).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on a systematic derivation from first principles, only option A accurately describes the consequences of both manipulations.",

There are no contradictions.\n- **Other criteria:** The problem is formalizable, relevant to the specified topic, realistic, and requires substantive reasoning to solve. It does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by the method of separation of variables. We assume the membrane potential deviation $V(x,t)$ can be expressed as a product of two functions, one depending only on space $x$ and the other only on time $t$:\n$$\nV(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this ansatz into the linear cable equation, $\\tau_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x^{2}} - V$, gives:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} X(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\lambda^{2} T(t) \\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - X(x)T(t)\n$$\nTo separate the variables, we divide the entire equation by the product $X(x)T(t)$, assuming $V(x,t) \\ne 0$:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - 1\n$$\nThe left side of the equation is a function of time $t$ only, while the right side is a function of position $x$ only. For this equality to hold for all $x$ and $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we shall call the separation constant, denoted by $-\\alpha$.\nThis yields two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1.  **Temporal ODE:**\n    $$\n    \\tau_{m} \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\tau_{m}}T(t)\n    $$\n2.  **Spatial ODE:**\n    $$\n    \\lambda^{2} \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - 1 = -\\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda^{2} \\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + (\\alpha - 1)X(x) = 0\n    $$\nThe spatial ODE, along with the boundary conditions, constitutes the spatial eigenproblem. The boundary conditions on $V(x,t)$ translate to conditions on $X(x)$.\nFrom $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}(0,t) = \\frac{dX}{dx}(0)T(t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}(L,t) = \\frac{dX}{dx}(L)T(t) = 0$, for a non-trivial solution ($T(t) \\not\\equiv 0$), we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0\n$$\nLet us analyze the spatial ODE: $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}X(x) = 0$. Let $k^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + k^{2}X(x) = 0$. We examine the cases for $k^{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $k^{2}  0$ (i.e., $\\alpha  1$).\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = -Ak\\sin(kx) + Bk\\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0$:\n$$\n-Ak\\sin(0) + Bk\\cos(0) = Bk = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $k \\neq 0$, which implies $B=0$. The solution simplifies to $X(x) = A\\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0$:\n$$\n-Ak\\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nTo avoid a trivial solution ($A=0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This condition is met when $kL = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\nThus, the admissible discrete values for the spatial wavenumber $k$ are:\n$$\nk_{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_{n}(x) = A_{n}\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nCase 2: $k^{2} = 0$ (i.e., $\\alpha = 1$).\nThe spatial ODE simplifies to $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} = 0$.\nThe general solution is $X(x) = Ax + B$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = A$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = A = 0$.\nThis gives $A=0$, leaving $X(x) = B$ (a constant). This is a non-trivial solution and corresponds to the $n=0$ mode from the previous case ($k_0 = 0$). The eigenfunction is $X_{0}(x) = A_0$.\n\nCase 3: $k^{2}  0$ (i.e., $\\alpha  1$).\nLet $k^{2} = -p^{2}$, where $p  0$. The ODE is $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - p^{2}X(x) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A\\cosh(px) + B\\sinh(px)$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = Ap\\sinh(px) + Bp\\cosh(px)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0$:\n$$\nAp\\sinh(0) + Bp\\cosh(0) = Bp = 0\n$$\nSince $p \\ne 0$, this implies $B=0$. The solution is $X(x) = A\\cosh(px)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0$:\n$$\nAp\\sinh(pL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\ne 0$) and given $p \\ne 0$, we must have $\\sinh(pL)=0$. Since $L0$, this is only possible if $pL=0$, which means $p=0$. This contradicts our assumption that $p0$. Therefore, there are no non-trivial solutions for $k^{2}  0$.\n\nCombining the results, the spatial eigenproblem has solutions only for $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ with $n$ being a non-negative integer, $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The set of admissible eigenfunctions is $\\{ \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) \\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nNow we determine the separation constants $\\alpha_n$ corresponding to each mode $n$. From $k_{n}^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n} - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n} - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_n$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{n} = 1 + \\lambda^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\lambda}{L}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNow we return to the temporal ODE for each mode $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{n}}{dt} = -\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}}T_{n}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n$$\nT_{n}(t) = T_{n}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}}t\\right)\n$$\nThe solution shows an exponential decay. The term multiplying $t$ in the exponent is the negative of the decay rate. The modal decay rate is $\\frac{1}{\\tau_n}$, where $\\tau_n$ is the modal time constant.\nThus, the decay rate is $\\frac{\\alpha_n}{\\tau_m}$, and the modal time constant $\\tau_n$ is its reciprocal multiplied by $\\tau_m$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{n}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tau_{n} = \\frac{\\tau_{m}}{\\alpha_{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha_n$ gives the final expression for the modal time constants:\n$$\n\\tau_{n} = \\frac{\\tau_{m}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\lambda}{L}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the modal time constants as a function of the non-negative integer mode index $n$, expressed in terms of the given parameters $\\tau_m$, $\\lambda$, and $L$. The unit of $\\tau_n$ is seconds, consistent with $\\tau_m$, as the denominator is dimensionless.",

Using the same physical parameters ($R_i$, $g_m$, $I_0$, $L$, $x_0$) and the same boundary conditions, compute the corresponding steady-state voltage profile $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ for the uniform-radius cable using the same numerical quadrature strategy.\n\nYour program must:\n- Discretize the cable into a uniform grid of $N$ points and use numerical quadrature to integrate the requisite homogeneous equations needed to construct the computational solution under a point-source injection using physically justified matching conditions.\n- Compute $V(x)$ for the tapered cable and $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ for the uniform-radius reference.\n- Quantify the discrepancy between $V(x)$ and $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ using the root-mean-square (RMS) difference over the grid:\n$$\\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(V(x_i) - V_\\mathrm{uni}(x_i)\\right)^2}.$$\n- Express the RMS discrepancy in volts (in $\\mathrm{V}$).\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets, each specified as $(R_i, g_m, r_0, s, L, x_0, I_0)$ with all quantities in SI units:\n- Test $1$: $\\left(1.0, 0.1, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -1.2 \\times 10^{-3}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $2$: $\\left(1.0, 0.1, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, 0.0, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $3$: $\\left(1.5, 0.05, 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -1.5 \\times 10^{-3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $4$: $\\left(0.8, 0.2, 0.8 \\times 10^{-6}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}, 2.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $5$: $\\left(1.0, 0.15, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -2.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n\nScientific realism constraints:\n- Ensure $r(x) = r_0 + s x > 0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$.\n- Use a sufficiently fine grid to reliably resolve the spatial voltage profile within the given physical scales.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the RMS discrepancies for Tests $1$ through $5$ as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4,d_5]$), where each $d_k$ is a floating-point number in $\\mathrm{V}$ computed as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical cable theory, well-posed as a linear second-order boundary value problem, and its parameters are specified within physically realistic ranges. The requirement to use a \"sufficiently fine grid\" is addressed by selecting a grid of $N=2001$ points, which provides adequate spatial resolution for the given length scales. All test cases satisfy the physical constraint $r(x)0$. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Governing Equation\n\nThe steady-state voltage profile $V(x)$ in a passive dendritic cable is governed by the principle of current conservation. Consider a small segment of the cable between $x$ and $x+dx$. The change in axial current, $I_a(x)$, along this segment must be balanced by the current flowing out through the membrane, $dI_m$.\n\nThe axial current $I_a(x)$ is driven by the voltage gradient according to Ohm's law:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -I_a(x) R_a(x) $$\nwhere $R_a(x)$ is the axial resistance per unit length. For a cylindrical segment of cytoplasmic resistivity $R_i$ and radius $r(x)$, $R_a(x) = \\frac{R_i}{A(x)} = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi r(x)^2}$, where $A(x)$ is the cross-sectional area. Thus, the axial current is:\n$$ I_a(x) = -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\n\nThe membrane current per unit length, $I_m'(x)$, is given by the product of the membrane current density $j_m(x)$ and the circumference $2\\pi r(x)$. The problem states that the leak reversal potential is $0$, so $j_m(x) = g_m V(x)$, where $g_m$ is the specific membrane conductance. Therefore:\n$$ I_m'(x) = 2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) $$\n\nConservation of current states that $\\frac{dI_a}{dx} = -I_m'(x)$. Differentiating the expression for $I_a(x)$ and substituting $I_m'(x)$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = -2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) $$\nCanceling terms and rearranging, we obtain the steady-state cable equation for a passive cable with varying radius:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( r(x)^2 \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = \\frac{2 R_i g_m}{1} r(x) V(x) $$\nExpanding the derivative and using $r(x) = r_0 + sx$, which implies $r'(x) = s$, we get:\n$$ r(x) \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} + 2s \\frac{dV}{dx} - 2 R_i g_m V(x) = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with variable coefficients. This equation holds for $x \\in [0, L]$ except at the point of current injection, $x_0$.\n\nA point current injection of amplitude $I_0$ at $x=x_0$ is modeled as a Dirac delta function source term. The full boundary value problem (BVP) is:\n$$ -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) + 2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) = I_0 \\delta(x-x_0) $$\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n$$ V(0) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Dirichlet at } x=0) $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx}(L) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Neumann at } x=L) $$\n\n### 2. Numerical Solution Strategy\n\nThe problem will be solved using a superposition method, which is a standard technique for linear BVPs with point sources (related to the Green's function method). The solution $V(x)$ is constructed from linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous ODE.\n\nThe voltage $V(x)$ must be continuous everywhere, including at $x_0$. Integrating the full BVP across an infinitesimal interval $[x_0-\\epsilon, x_0+\\epsilon]$ reveals a jump condition in the derivative of the voltage, corresponding to the injected current:\n$$ \\left[ -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right]_{x_0^-}^{x_0^+} = I_0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^+} - \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^-} = -\\frac{R_i I_0}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} $$\nNote the sign convention difference from the derivation section to match the full BVP equation formulation.\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right]_{x_0^-}^{x_0^+} = -I_0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^+} - \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^-} = -\\frac{I_0 R_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} $$\nLet's re-verify from first principles: $I_a(x_0^-) - I_a(x_0^+) = I_0$, where $I_0$ is injected current.\nUsing $I_a(x) = -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{R_i} \\frac{dV}{dx}$, this gives $(-\\frac{\\pi r(x_0)^2}{R_i} V'(x_0^-)) - (-\\frac{\\pi r(x_0)^2}{R_i} V'(x_0^+)) = I_0$, which simplifies to $V'(x_0^+) - V'(x_0^-) = \\frac{I_0 R_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$. This is the correct jump condition.\n\nTo construct the solution, we find two fundamental solutions, $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$, of the homogeneous equation:\n1.  $u_1(x)$ satisfies the left boundary condition: $u_1(0)=0$. We can find it by integrating the homogeneous ODE from $x=0$ with initial conditions $u_1(0)=0$ and $u_1'(0)=1$.\n2.  $u_2(x)$ satisfies the right boundary condition: $u_2'(L)=0$. We can find it by integrating the homogeneous ODE backward from $x=L$ with \"initial\" conditions $u_2(L)=1$ and $u_2'(L)=0$.\n\nThe final solution $V(x)$ is then constructed as a piecewise combination of these fundamental solutions:\n$$ V(x) = \\begin{cases} A \\, u_1(x)  0 \\le x \\le x_0 \\\\ B \\, u_2(x)  x_0  x \\le L \\end{cases} $$\nThis form automatically satisfies the boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$. The unknown coefficients $A$ and $B$ are determined by applying the matching conditions at $x=x_0$:\n1.  Continuity of voltage: $V(x_0^-) = V(x_0^+)$ implies $A u_1(x_0) = B u_2(x_0)$.\n2.  Jump in derivative: $V'(x_0^+) - V'(x_0^-) = \\frac{I_0 R_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$ implies $B u_2'(x_0) - A u_1'(x_0) = \\frac{I_0 R_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$.\n\nThis gives a $2 \\times 2$ linear system for $A$ and $B$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} u_1(x_0)  -u_2(x_0) \\\\ -u_1'(x_0)  u_2'(x_0) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{I_0 R_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis system is solved for $A$ and $B$, allowing the full solution $V(x)$ to be constructed.\n\n### 3. Numerical Implementation\n\nTo implement this strategy, we convert the second-order homogeneous ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let $\\mathbf{y}(x) = [V(x), V'(x)]^T$. The system is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\frac{1}{r(x)}(-2s y_2 + 2 R_i g_m y_1) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe use a numerical ODE solver (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`) to find the solutions $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ on a uniform spatial grid of $N=2001$ points.\n-   `u1_sol` is found by integrating forward from $x=0$ with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [0, 1]^T$.\n-   `u2_sol` is found by integrating backward from $x=L$ with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}(L) = [1, 0]^T$.\n\nThese numerical solutions provide the values of $u_1, u_1', u_2, u_2'$ at the grid point closest to $x_0$, which are then used to solve for $A$ and $B$.\n\n### 4. Uniform-Radius Reference and Discrepancy\n\nFor the uniform-radius baseline, we replace the tapered radius $r(x)$ with its spatial average $\\bar{r} = r_0 + \\frac{1}{2}sL$. The same numerical procedure is applied, but with the simplified ODE corresponding to a uniform cable (i.e., setting $s=0$ and using $r_0 = \\bar{r}$). The voltage profile $V_{\\text{uni}}(x)$ is computed. The discrepancy between the tapered and uniform solutions is quantified by the root-mean-square (RMS) difference:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(V(x_i) - V_\\mathrm{uni}(x_i)\\right)^2} $$\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each test case provided in the problem statement.",
