            "problem": "Consider a uniform, passive dendritic cable modeled as a straight cylinder of radius $a$, intracellular resistivity $R_{i}$, and specific membrane resistance $R_{m}$. Assume steady state (no time dependence) so that membrane capacitance does not contribute. The cable extends from $x=0$ to $x \\to \\infty$ (semi-infinite), and the membrane potential is clamped to a constant value $V_{0}$ at $x=0$ relative to rest. Use the laws of conservation of electric current and Ohm's law to derive the steady-state spatial profile of the membrane potential along the cable and the corresponding length constant in terms of $a$, $R_{i}$, and $R_{m}$.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard problem in biomedical systems modeling, specifically concerning the application of cable theory to neuronal dendrites. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts. First, we derive the fundamental equations for the steady-state membrane potential, the length constant, and the input current from first principles. Second, we analyze the effects of the two proposed scenarios on these derived quantities. Third, we compute the required ratio of input currents.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fundamental Equations**\n\nWe model the dendritic cable as a cylinder of radius $a$ and intracellular resistivity $R_i$. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is the intracellular resistance of a one-meter length of the cable. For a resistor of length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, and resistivity $\\rho$, the resistance is $R = \\rho L / A$. Thus, the resistance per unit length is $\\rho/A$. In our case, the cross-sectional area is $A = \\pi a^2$ and the resistivity is $R_i$. Therefore,\n$$r_i = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\nThe units of $r_i$ are $\\Omega/\\text{m}$.\n\nThe membrane has a specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (units: $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}^2$). The membrane resistance for a segment of cable of length $\\Delta x$ is inversely proportional to the surface area of that segment, which is $2\\pi a \\Delta x$. The total membrane conductance of this segment is $G_m = (2\\pi a \\Delta x) / R_m$. The membrane conductance per unit length is $g_m = G_m / \\Delta x = 2\\pi a / R_m$. The membrane resistance per unit length, $r_m$, is defined as the reciprocal of the conductance per unit length:\n$$r_m = \\frac{1}{g_m} = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\nThe units of $r_m$ are $\\Omega \\cdot \\text{m}$.\n\nNow, we derive the steady-state cable equation. Let $V(x)$ be the membrane potential relative to the resting potential and $I_i(x)$ be the axial current along the inside of the cable. According to Ohm's law applied to a small segment of length $dx$, the voltage drop along the axial resistor is $dV = -I_i(x) r_i dx$. This gives our first differential relation:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = -I_i r_i \\quad (1)$$\nBy conservation of current, the change in axial current over the segment $dx$, which is $dI_i$, must be equal to the current that leaks out through the membrane, $I_m$. The membrane current per unit length is $i_m = V(x)/r_m$. Thus, for the segment $dx$, the leakage current is $I_m = i_m dx = (V/r_m) dx$. The change in axial current is $dI_i = I_i(x) - I_i(x+dx)$, so $dI_i = -I_m = -(V/r_m) dx$. This gives our second differential relation:\n$$\\frac{dI_i}{dx} = -\\frac{V}{r_m} \\quad (2)$$\nTo obtain a single equation for $V(x)$, we differentiate equation (1) with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -r_i \\frac{dI_i}{dx}$$\nSubstituting equation (2) into this expression yields:\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = -r_i \\left(-\\frac{V}{r_m}\\right) = \\frac{r_i}{r_m} V$$\nThis is the steady-state cable equation. We define the length constant $\\lambda$ such that $\\lambda^2 = r_m / r_i$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V = 0$$\nThe general solution to this second-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$V(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda) + C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\nWe apply the boundary conditions for a semi-infinite cable ($x \\in [0, \\infty)$):\n1. The potential is clamped at $x=0$: $V(0) = V_0$.\n2. The potential must decay to the resting potential (i.e., $V \\to 0$) as $x \\to \\infty$. This is because the cable is passive and there are no energy sources at infinity.\n\nThe second boundary condition requires $C_1 = 0$, as $\\exp(x/\\lambda)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$. The solution simplifies to $V(x) = C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. Applying the first boundary condition, $V(0) = V_0 = C_2 \\exp(0) = C_2$.\nTherefore, the steady-state spatial profile of the membrane potential is:\n$$V(x) = V_0 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\nThe length constant $\\lambda$ can be expressed in terms of the primary parameters $a$, $R_i$, and $R_m$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m/(2\\pi a)}{R_i/(\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a} \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a R_m}{2 R_i}}$$\nThe axial current entering the cable at $x=0$, denoted $I_{in}$, is $I_i(0)$. From equation (1), $I_i(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{dV}{dx}$. We calculate the derivative of $V(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = V_0 \\frac{d}{dx} \\exp(-x/\\lambda) = -\\frac{V_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\nSo, the axial current is:\n$$I_i(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i} \\left(-\\frac{V_0}{\\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)\\right) = \\frac{V_0}{r_i \\lambda} \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$$\nThe input current at $x=0$ is:\n$$I_{in} = I_i(0) = \\frac{V_0}{r_i \\lambda}$$\n\n**Part 2: Scenario Analysis**\n\nLet the initial parameters be denoted with a subscript '$0$': $a_0$, $R_{i0}$, $R_{m0}$. The initial derived quantities are:\n$r_{i0} = \\frac{R_{i0}}{\\pi a_0^2}$\n$\\lambda_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{2 R_{i0}}}$\n$I_{in0} = \\frac{V_0}{r_{i0} \\lambda_0}$\n\n**Scenario A: $a_A = 2a_0$, $R_i$ and $R_m$ are fixed.**\n- Axial resistance per unit length:\n  $r_{iA} = \\frac{R_{i0}}{\\pi a_A^2} = \\frac{R_{i0}}{\\pi (2a_0)^2} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{R_{i0}}{\\pi a_0^2} = \\frac{1}{4} r_{i0}$.\n- Length constant:\n  $\\lambda_A = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_A R_{m0}}{2 R_{i0}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{(2a_0) R_{m0}}{2 R_{i0}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{2 R_{i0}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\lambda_0$.\n- Attenuation at $x=d$: The voltage is $V(d) = V_0 \\exp(-d/\\lambda)$. Since $\\lambda_A > \\lambda_0$, the exponent $-d/\\lambda_A$ is less negative than $-d/\\lambda_0$. This means $\\exp(-d/\\lambda_A) > \\exp(-d/\\lambda_0)$, so the attenuation is weaker (the voltage is higher at distance $d$).\n- Input current:\n  $I_{inA} = \\frac{V_0}{r_{iA} \\lambda_A} = \\frac{V_0}{(\\frac{1}{4}r_{i0})(\\sqrt{2}\\lambda_0)} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{V_0}{r_{i0}\\lambda_0} = 2\\sqrt{2} I_{in0}$.\n\n**Scenario B: $R_{iB} = R_{i0}/2$, $a$ and $R_m$ are fixed.**\n- Axial resistance per unit length:\n  $r_{iB} = \\frac{R_{iB}}{\\pi a_0^2} = \\frac{R_{i0}/2}{\\pi a_0^2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{R_{i0}}{\\pi a_0^2} = \\frac{1}{2} r_{i0}$.\n- Length constant:\n  $\\lambda_B = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{2 R_{iB}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{2 (R_{i0}/2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{R_{i0}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{a_0 R_{m0}}{2 R_{i0}}} = \\sqrt{2} \\lambda_0$.\n- Attenuation at $x=d$: Since $\\lambda_B = \\lambda_A$, the change in attenuation from the baseline case is identical to Scenario A. Attenuation is weaker.\n- Input current:\n  $I_{inB} = \\frac{V_0}{r_{iB} \\lambda_B} = \\frac{V_0}{(\\frac{1}{2}r_{i0})(\\sqrt{2}\\lambda_0)} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{V_0}{r_{i0}\\lambda_0} = \\sqrt{2} I_{in0}$.\n\n**Part 3: Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the axial current inflow at $x=0$ under Scenario A to that under Scenario B.\n$$\\frac{I_{inA}}{I_{inB}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2} I_{in0}}{\\sqrt{2} I_{in0}} = 2$$\nThe ratio is a pure number.",

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by the method of separation of variables. We assume the membrane potential deviation $V(x,t)$ can be expressed as a product of two functions, one depending only on space $x$ and the other only on time $t$:\n$$\nV(x,t) = X(x)T(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this ansatz into the linear cable equation, $\\tau_{m} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} V}{\\partial x^{2}} - V$, gives:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} X(x) \\frac{dT}{dt} = \\lambda^{2} T(t) \\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - X(x)T(t)\n$$\nTo separate the variables, we divide the entire equation by the product $X(x)T(t)$, assuming $V(x,t) \\ne 0$:\n$$\n\\tau_{m} \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = \\lambda^{2} \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - 1\n$$\nThe left side of the equation is a function of time $t$ only, while the right side is a function of position $x$ only. For this equality to hold for all $x$ and $t$, both sides must be equal to a constant, which we shall call the separation constant, denoted by $-\\alpha$.\nThis yields two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1.  **Temporal ODE:**\n    $$\n    \\tau_{m} \\frac{1}{T(t)}\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{\\alpha}{\\tau_{m}}T(t)\n    $$\n2.  **Spatial ODE:**\n    $$\n    \\lambda^{2} \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - 1 = -\\alpha \\quad \\implies \\quad \\lambda^{2} \\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + (\\alpha - 1)X(x) = 0\n    $$\nThe spatial ODE, along with the boundary conditions, constitutes the spatial eigenproblem. The boundary conditions on $V(x,t)$ translate to conditions on $X(x)$.\nFrom $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}(0,t) = \\frac{dX}{dx}(0)T(t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}(L,t) = \\frac{dX}{dx}(L)T(t) = 0$, for a non-trivial solution ($T(t) \\not\\equiv 0$), we must have:\n$$\n\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0\n$$\nLet us analyze the spatial ODE: $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}X(x) = 0$. Let $k^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}$. The equation becomes $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} + k^{2}X(x) = 0$. We examine the cases for $k^{2}$.\n\nCase 1: $k^{2} > 0$ (i.e., $\\alpha > 1$).\nThe general solution for $X(x)$ is $X(x) = A\\cos(kx) + B\\sin(kx)$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = -Ak\\sin(kx) + Bk\\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0$:\n$$\n-Ak\\sin(0) + Bk\\cos(0) = Bk = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we need $k \\neq 0$, which implies $B=0$. The solution simplifies to $X(x) = A\\cos(kx)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0$:\n$$\n-Ak\\sin(kL) = 0\n$$\nTo avoid a trivial solution ($A=0$), we must have $\\sin(kL) = 0$. This condition is met when $kL = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\nThus, the admissible discrete values for the spatial wavenumber $k$ are:\n$$\nk_{n} = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}, \\quad n = 1, 2, 3, \\dots\n$$\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $X_{n}(x) = A_{n}\\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$.\n\nCase 2: $k^{2} = 0$ (i.e., $\\alpha = 1$).\nThe spatial ODE simplifies to $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} = 0$.\nThe general solution is $X(x) = Ax + B$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = A$.\nApplying the boundary conditions:\n$\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = A = 0$.\n$\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = A = 0$.\nThis gives $A=0$, leaving $X(x) = B$ (a constant). This is a non-trivial solution and corresponds to the $n=0$ mode from the previous case ($k_0 = 0$). The eigenfunction is $X_{0}(x) = A_0$.\n\nCase 3: $k^{2}  0$ (i.e., $\\alpha  1$).\nLet $k^{2} = -p^{2}$, where $p > 0$. The ODE is $\\frac{d^{2}X}{dx^{2}} - p^{2}X(x) = 0$.\nThe general solution is $X(x) = A\\cosh(px) + B\\sinh(px)$.\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dX}{dx} = Ap\\sinh(px) + Bp\\cosh(px)$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(0) = 0$:\n$$\nAp\\sinh(0) + Bp\\cosh(0) = Bp = 0\n$$\nSince $p \\ne 0$, this implies $B=0$. The solution is $X(x) = A\\cosh(px)$.\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\frac{dX}{dx}(L) = 0$:\n$$\nAp\\sinh(pL) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($A \\ne 0$) and given $p \\ne 0$, we must have $\\sinh(pL)=0$. Since $L0$, this is only possible if $pL=0$, which means $p=0$. This contradicts our assumption that $p0$. Therefore, there are no non-trivial solutions for $k^{2}  0$.\n\nCombining the results, the spatial eigenproblem has solutions only for $k_n = \\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ with $n$ being a non-negative integer, $n=0, 1, 2, \\dots$. The set of admissible eigenfunctions is $\\{ \\cos(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}) \\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$.\n\nNow we determine the separation constants $\\alpha_n$ corresponding to each mode $n$. From $k_{n}^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n} - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n} - 1}{\\lambda^{2}}\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha_n$:\n$$\n\\alpha_{n} = 1 + \\lambda^{2}\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\lambda}{L}\\right)^{2}\n$$\nNow we return to the temporal ODE for each mode $n$:\n$$\n\\frac{dT_{n}}{dt} = -\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}}T_{n}(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n$$\nT_{n}(t) = T_{n}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}}t\\right)\n$$\nThe solution shows an exponential decay. The term multiplying $t$ in the exponent is the negative of the decay rate. The modal decay rate is $\\frac{1}{\\tau_n}$, where $\\tau_n$ is the modal time constant.\nThus, the decay rate is $\\frac{\\alpha_n}{\\tau_m}$, and the modal time constant $\\tau_n$ is its reciprocal multiplied by $\\tau_m$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{n}} = \\frac{\\alpha_{n}}{\\tau_{m}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tau_{n} = \\frac{\\tau_{m}}{\\alpha_{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\alpha_n$ gives the final expression for the modal time constants:\n$$\n\\tau_{n} = \\frac{\\tau_{m}}{1 + \\left(\\frac{n\\pi\\lambda}{L}\\right)^{2}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the modal time constants as a function of the non-negative integer mode index $n$, expressed in terms of the given parameters $\\tau_m$, $\\lambda$, and $L$.

Using the same physical parameters ($r_i$, $g_m$, $I_0$, $L$, $x_0$) and the same boundary conditions, compute the corresponding steady-state voltage profile $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ for the uniform-radius cable using the same numerical quadrature strategy.\n\nYour program must:\n- Discretize the cable into a uniform grid of $N$ points and use numerical quadrature to integrate the requisite homogeneous equations needed to construct the computational solution under a point-source injection using physically justified matching conditions.\n- Compute $V(x)$ for the tapered cable and $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ for the uniform-radius reference.\n- Quantify the discrepancy between $V(x)$ and $V_\\mathrm{uni}(x)$ using the root-mean-square (RMS) difference over the grid:\n$$\\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(V(x_i) - V_\\mathrm{uni}(x_i)\\right)^2}.$$\n- Express the RMS discrepancy in volts (in $\\mathrm{V}$).\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets, each specified as $\\left(r_i, g_m, r_0, s, L, x_0, I_0\\right)$ with all quantities in SI units:\n- Test $1$: $\\left(1.0, 0.1, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -1.2 \\times 10^{-3}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 2.5 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $2$: $\\left(1.0, 0.1, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, 0.0, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $3$: $\\left(1.5, 0.05, 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -1.5 \\times 10^{-3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $4$: $\\left(0.8, 0.2, 0.8 \\times 10^{-6}, 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}, 2.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n- Test $5$: $\\left(1.0, 0.15, 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}, -2.0 \\times 10^{-4}, 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}, 3.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\right)$.\n\nScientific realism constraints:\n- Ensure $r(x) = r_0 + s x  0$ for all $x \\in [0,L]$.\n- Use a sufficiently fine grid to reliably resolve the spatial voltage profile within the given physical scales.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the RMS discrepancies for Tests $1$ through $5$ as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., $[d_1,d_2,d_3,d_4,d_5]$), where each $d_k$ is a floating-point number in $\\mathrm{V}$ computed as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical cable theory, well-posed as a linear second-order boundary value problem, and its parameters are specified within physically realistic ranges. The requirement to use a \"sufficiently fine grid\" is addressed by selecting a grid of $N=2001$ points, which provides adequate spatial resolution for the given length scales. All test cases satisfy the physical constraint $r(x)0$. We may therefore proceed with a solution.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Governing Equation\n\nThe steady-state voltage profile $V(x)$ in a passive dendritic cable is governed by the principle of current conservation. Consider a small segment of the cable between $x$ and $x+dx$. The change in axial current, $I_a(x)$, along this segment must be balanced by the current flowing out through the membrane, $dI_m$.\n\nThe axial current $I_a(x)$ is driven by the voltage gradient according to Ohm's law:\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx} = -I_a(x) R_a(x) $$\nwhere $R_a(x)$ is the axial resistance per unit length. For a cylindrical segment of cytoplasmic resistivity $r_i$ and radius $r(x)$, $R_a(x) = \\frac{r_i}{A(x)} = \\frac{r_i}{\\pi r(x)^2}$, where $A(x)$ is the cross-sectional area. Thus, the axial current is:\n$$ I_a(x) = -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} $$\n\nThe membrane current per unit length, $I_m'(x)$, is given by the product of the membrane current density $j_m(x)$ and the circumference $2\\pi r(x)$. The problem states that the leak reversal potential is $0$, so $j_m(x) = g_m V(x)$, where $g_m$ is the specific membrane conductance. Therefore:\n$$ I_m'(x) = 2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) $$\n\nConservation of current states that $\\frac{dI_a}{dx} = -I_m'(x)$. Differentiating the expression for $I_a(x)$ and substituting $I_m'(x)$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = -2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) $$\nCanceling terms and rearranging, we obtain the steady-state cable equation for a passive cable with varying radius:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( r(x)^2 \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) = 2 r_i g_m r(x) V(x) $$\nExpanding the derivative and using $r(x) = r_0 + sx$, which implies $r'(x) = s$, we get:\n$$ r(x) \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} + 2s \\frac{dV}{dx} - 2 r_i g_m V(x) = 0 $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation (ODE) with variable coefficients. This equation holds for $x \\in [0, L]$ except at the point of current injection, $x_0$.\n\nA point current injection of amplitude $I_0$ at $x=x_0$ is modeled as a Dirac delta function source term. The full boundary value problem (BVP) is:\n$$ -\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right) + 2 \\pi r(x) g_m V(x) = I_0 \\delta(x-x_0) $$\nsubject to the boundary conditions:\n$$ V(0) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Dirichlet at } x=0) $$\n$$ \\frac{dV}{dx}(L) = 0 \\quad (\\text{Neumann at } x=L) $$\n\n### 2. Numerical Solution Strategy\n\nThe problem will be solved using a superposition method, which is a standard technique for linear BVPs with point sources (related to the Green's function method). The solution $V(x)$ is constructed from linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous ODE.\n\nThe voltage $V(x)$ must be continuous everywhere, including at $x_0$. Integrating the full BVP across an infinitesimal interval $[x_0-\\epsilon, x_0+\\epsilon]$ reveals a jump condition in the derivative of the voltage, corresponding to the injected current:\n$$ \\left[ -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right]_{x_0^-}^{x_0^+} = I_0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^+} - \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^-} = -\\frac{r_i I_0}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} $$\nNote the sign convention difference from the derivation section to match the full BVP equation formulation.\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx} \\right]_{x_0^-}^{x_0^+} = -I_0 \\implies \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^+} - \\frac{dV}{dx}\\bigg|_{x_0^-} = -\\frac{I_0 r_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} $$\nLet's re-verify from first principles: $I_a(x_0^-) - I_a(x_0^+) = I_0$, where $I_0$ is injected current.\nUsing $I_a(x) = -\\frac{\\pi r(x)^2}{r_i} \\frac{dV}{dx}$, this gives $(-\\frac{\\pi r(x_0)^2}{r_i} V'(x_0^-)) - (-\\frac{\\pi r(x_0)^2}{r_i} V'(x_0^+)) = I_0$, which simplifies to $V'(x_0^+) - V'(x_0^-) = \\frac{I_0 r_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$. This is the correct jump condition.\n\nTo construct the solution, we find two fundamental solutions, $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$, of the homogeneous equation:\n1.  $u_1(x)$ satisfies the left boundary condition: $u_1(0)=0$. We can find it by integrating the homogeneous ODE from $x=0$ with initial conditions $u_1(0)=0$ and $u_1'(0)=1$.\n2.  $u_2(x)$ satisfies the right boundary condition: $u_2'(L)=0$. We can find it by integrating the homogeneous ODE backward from $x=L$ with \"initial\" conditions $u_2(L)=1$ and $u_2'(L)=0$.\n\nThe final solution $V(x)$ is then constructed as a piecewise combination of these fundamental solutions:\n$$ V(x) = \\begin{cases} A \\, u_1(x)  0 \\le x \\le x_0 \\\\ B \\, u_2(x)  x_0  x \\le L \\end{cases} $$\nThis form automatically satisfies the boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$. The unknown coefficients $A$ and $B$ are determined by applying the matching conditions at $x=x_0$:\n1.  Continuity of voltage: $V(x_0^-) = V(x_0^+)$ implies $A u_1(x_0) = B u_2(x_0)$.\n2.  Jump in derivative: $V'(x_0^+) - V'(x_0^-) = \\frac{I_0 r_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$ implies $B u_2'(x_0) - A u_1'(x_0) = \\frac{I_0 r_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2}$.\n\nThis gives a $2 \\times 2$ linear system for $A$ and $B$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} u_1(x_0)  -u_2(x_0) \\\\ -u_1'(x_0)  u_2'(x_0) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} A \\\\ B \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\frac{I_0 r_i}{\\pi r(x_0)^2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis system is solved for $A$ and $B$, allowing the full solution $V(x)$ to be constructed.\n\n### 3. Numerical Implementation\n\nTo implement this strategy, we convert the second-order homogeneous ODE into a system of two first-order ODEs. Let $\\mathbf{y}(x) = [V(x), V'(x)]^T$. The system is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dx} = \\begin{pmatrix} y_2 \\\\ \\frac{1}{r(x)}(-2s y_2 + 2 r_i g_m y_1) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe use a numerical ODE solver (`scipy.integrate.solve_ivp`) to find the solutions $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ on a uniform spatial grid of $N=2001$ points.\n-   `u1_sol` is found by integrating forward from $x=0$ with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}(0) = [0, 1]^T$.\n-   `u2_sol` is found by integrating backward from $x=L$ with initial condition $\\mathbf{y}(L) = [1, 0]^T$.\n\nThese numerical solutions provide the values of $u_1, u_1', u_2, u_2'$ at the grid point closest to $x_0$, which are then used to solve for $A$ and $B$.\n\n### 4. Uniform-Radius Reference and Discrepancy\n\nFor the uniform-radius baseline, we replace the tapered radius $r(x)$ with its spatial average $\\bar{r} = r_0 + \\frac{1}{2}sL$. The same numerical procedure is applied, but with the simplified ODE corresponding to a uniform cable (i.e., setting $s=0$ and using $r_0 = \\bar{r}$). The voltage profile $V_{\\text{uni}}(x)$ is computed. The discrepancy between the tapered and uniform solutions is quantified by the root-mean-square (RMS) difference:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\left(V(x_i) - V_\\mathrm{uni}(x_i)\\right)^2} $$\n\nThis entire procedure is applied to each test case provided in the problem statement.",
