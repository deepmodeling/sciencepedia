This exercise focuses on the fundamental dynamics of these pressures during a quiet breathing cycle. By modeling key physiological signals as sinusoids, we can practice calculating the transpulmonary pressure ($P_L$), which distends the lungs, and the transdiaphragmatic pressure ($P_{di}$), which reflects the effort of the diaphragm. This practice will strengthen your ability to interpret time-varying pressure data and understand the phasic coordination between lung inflation and diaphragmatic contraction .",

The amplitude $A$ can be determined by treating the sinusoids as vectors (phasors) in a polar coordinate system and finding the magnitude of their sum. The squared amplitude is given by the law of cosines:\n$$ A^2 = C_1^2 + C_2^2 + 2C_1C_2\\cos(\\phi_1 - \\phi_2) $$\n\nFor the transpulmonary pressure amplitude, $A_L$:\nThe oscillatory component is $P_{L,osc}(t) = 3\\,\\sin(\\omega t) - 0.5\\,\\sin\\left(\\omega t - \\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)$.

This muscular effort makes the pleural pressure ($P_{pl}$, approximated by $P_{es}$) more negative. The term $-3\\sin(\\omega t)$ in $P_{es}(t)$ drives this change, making $P_{es}$ most negative at peak inspiration.\n\nThe transpulmonary pressure, $P_L = P_A - P_{pl}$, is the distending pressure across the lung. As $P_{pl}$ becomes more negative during inspiration, $P_L$ increases, causing the lungs to inflate. The oscillatory component of $P_L(t)$ is dominated by the $+3\\sin(\\omega t)$ term (from $-P_{es}$), so $P_L$ increases during inspiration as expected.\n\nThe transdiaphragmatic pressure, $P_{di} = P_{ga} - P_{pl}$, reflects the tension developed by the diaphragm. Diaphragmatic contraction during inspiration simultaneously raises gastric pressure ($P_{ga}$) and lowers pleural pressure ($P_{pl}$), causing a significant increase in $P_{di}$. The oscillatory component of $P_{di}(t)$ contains two positive, nearly in-phase sinusoidal terms ($3\\sin(\\omega t)$ from $-P_{es}$ and $2\\sin(\\omega t - \\pi/12)$ from $P_{ga}$), which sum to a large positive value during inspiration, correctly modeling the active contraction of the diaphragm.\n\nDuring quiet expiration, these muscles relax. The elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall drives the pressures back towards their resting states. $P_{pl}$ becomes less negative, so $P_L$ decreases and the lungs deflate. The diaphragm relaxes, so $P_{di}$ decreases. These changes correspond to the parts of the cycle where the oscillatory components of $P_L$ and $P_{di}$ decrease and become negative.\n\nThe ratio $R \\approx 1.948$ indicates that the amplitude of the pressure swing generated by the diaphragm ($A_{di}$) is nearly twice the amplitude of the pressure swing that inflates the lung ($A_L$), which is a plausible relationship for quiet, diaphragm-dominant breathing.",

We first compute the values of the regressors, $\\dot{V}(t)$ and $V(t)$, and list the corresponding pressure measurements, $P_{aw}(t)$.\nFor $t_1 = 0$: $V(0) = 0.5\\,\\sin(0) = 0$, $\\dot{V}(0) = 0.5\\,\\cos(0) = 0.5$, and $P_{aw}(0) = 1.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$.\nFor $t_2 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$: $V(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0.5\\,\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0.5$, $\\dot{V}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0.5\\,\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 0$, and $P_{aw}(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = 4.5\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$.\nFor $t_3 = \\pi$: $V(\\pi) = 0.5\\,\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, $\\dot{V}(\\pi) = 0.5\\,\\cos(\\pi) = -0.5$, and $P_{aw}(\\pi) = -1.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$.\nFor $t_4 = \\frac{3\\pi}{2}$: $V(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0.5\\,\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -0.5$, $\\dot{V}(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0.5\\,\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = 0$, and $P_{aw}(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) = -4.5\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}$.\n\nThis system can be expressed in the matrix form $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is the vector of pressure observations, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the design matrix, and $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is the parameter vector.\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\\\ 4.5 \\\\ -1.0 \\\\ -4.5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{V}(0)  V(0) \\\\ \\dot{V}(\\frac{\\pi}{2})  V(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) \\\\ \\dot{V}(\\pi)  V(\\pi) \\\\ \\dot{V}(\\frac{3\\pi}{2})  V(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\\\ -0.5  0 \\\\ 0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\begin{pmatrix} R_{aw} \\\\ E_{rs} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe least-squares solution for $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is given by $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$. We first compute the normal matrix, $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0  -0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5  0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\\\ -0.5  0 \\\\ 0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2  0 \\\\ 0  (0.5)^2 + (-0.5)^2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe inverse of this matrix is:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{0.5}  0 \\\\ 0  \\frac{1}{0.5} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the product $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0  -0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5  0  -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\\\ 4.5 \\\\ -1.0 \\\\ -4.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (0.5)(1.0) + (-0.5)(-1.0) \\\\ (0.5)(4.5) + (-0.5)(-4.5) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\\\ 4.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, the estimated parameters are:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\hat{R}_{aw} \\\\ \\hat{E}_{rs} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  0 \\\\ 0  2 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.0 \\\\ 4.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.0 \\\\ 9.0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe estimates are $\\hat{R}_{aw} = 2.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{s}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$ and $\\hat{E}_{rs} = 9.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem asks for an evaluation of the regression conditioning. The condition number of the normal matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$ using the $2$-norm is the ratio of its largest to smallest eigenvalue, $\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{max}}{\\lambda_{min}}$. For the diagonal matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5  0 \\\\ 0  0.5 \\end{pmatrix}$, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_{max} = \\lambda_{min} = 0.5$. Thus, the condition number is $\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{A}) = \\frac{0.5}{0.5} = 1$. This is the minimum possible value, indicating that the regression problem is perfectly well-conditioned. This is because the sampling schedule (at quarter-period intervals) makes the regressor columns (scaled cosine and sine functions) orthogonal over the sample set, which decouples the estimation of $R_{aw}$ and $E_{rs}$.\n\nNext, we determine the chest wall compliance, $C_W$. The total elastance $E_{rs} = 1/C_{rs}$ is the sum of the lung elastance $E_L = 1/C_L$ and the chest wall elastance $E_W = 1/C_W$:\n$$\nE_{rs} = E_L + E_W = \\frac{1}{C_L} + \\frac{1}{C_W}\n$$\nThe identifiability of $C_W$ depends on two factors. First, $E_{rs}$ must be uniquely identifiable from the pressure-volume data, which our well-conditioned regression has established. Second, for $C_W$ to be physically meaningful (i.e., a positive finite value), the chest wall elastance $E_W = 1/C_W$ must be positive. This leads to the condition:\n$$\nE_{rs} - \\frac{1}{C_L} > 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad E_{rs} > \\frac{1}{C_L}\n$$\nThis condition states that the total elastance of the respiratory system must exceed the elastance of the lung alone, a physical necessity for components in series. We verify this using our data: $\\hat{E}_{rs} = 9.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$ and $C_L = 0.20\\,\\text{L}\\cdot\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-1}$, which implies a lung elastance of $E_L = \\frac{1}{0.20} = 5.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}$. The condition $9.0 > 5.0$ holds, so $C_W$ is identifiable.\n\nWe can now compute $C_W$ by rearranging the elastance equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_W} = E_{rs} - \\frac{1}{C_L}\n$$\nSubstituting the estimated and given values:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{C_W} = 9.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} - 5.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1} = 4.0\\,\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}\\cdot\\text{L}^{-1}\n$$\nTherefore, the chest wall compliance is:\n$$\nC_W = \\frac{1}{4.0} = 0.25\\,\\text{L}\\cdot\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $0.2500\\,\\text{L}\\cdot\\text{cmH}_{2}\\text{O}^{-1}$.",
