The solution proceeds from the principle of mass conservation for glucose in a single-compartment model.\n\nThe governing equation for the total body glucose mass, $M$, is given by the balance of appearance and disappearance rates:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = (\\text{Rate of Appearance}) - (\\text{Rate of Disappearance})\n$$\nThe total rate of appearance is the sum of the rate of appearance from the gut, $R_a$, and the total hepatic glucose production. The total hepatic glucose production is the product of the HGP rate per unit body mass and the body mass, which we denote as $M_{body}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Appearance} = R_a + (\\text{HGP}_{\\text{rate}} \\times M_{body})\n$$\nThe total rate of disappearance is the sum of the insulin-independent uptake, insulin-dependent uptake $U_{id}$, and renal excretion $E_r$. The total insulin-independent uptake is the product of the $U_{ii}$ rate per unit body mass and the body mass.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Disappearance} = (\\text{U}_{ii, \\text{rate}} \\times M_{body}) + U_{id} + E_r\n$$\nCombining these terms, the mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = R_a + (\\text{HGP}_{\\text{rate}} \\times M_{body}) - \\left[ (\\text{U}_{ii, \\text{rate}} \\times M_{body}) + U_{id} + E_r \\right]\n$$\nThe problem states that the total glucose mass $M$ is related to the glucose concentration $G$ and the distribution volume $V_G$ by $M = V_G G$. Assuming $V_G$ is constant, the rate of change of mass is $dM/dt = V_G (dG/dt)$. Substituting this into the mass balance equation gives the dynamic equation for glucose concentration:\n$$\nV_G \\frac{dG}{dt} = R_a + (\\text{HGP}_{\\text{rate}} \\times M_{body}) - (\\text{U}_{ii, \\text{rate}} \\times M_{body}) - U_{id} - E_r\n$$\n\nThe first quantity to compute is the time derivative of glucose concentration, $\\dot{G} = dG/dt$. The problem specifies the condition of a \"fasting steady state\". By definition, a steady state in a dynamic system is a condition where the state variables do not change over time.

Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It is a valid problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe goal is to find the time $t^{\\ast}$ that maximizes $R_{a}(t)$. This requires finding an explicit expression for $R_{a}(t)$. Since $R_{a}(t)$ is proportional to $I(t)$, we must first solve the system of ODEs for $I(t)$.\n\nFirst, we solve for the amount of glucose in the stomach, $S(t)$.\nThe governing equation is a first-order, homogeneous linear ODE:\n$$\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -k_{empt} S(t)$$\nwith the initial condition $S(0) = D$. The solution is found by separation of variables or by recognizing the standard form for exponential decay:\n$$S(t) = S(0)\\,\\exp(-k_{empt} t) = D\\,\\exp(-k_{empt} t)$$\n\nNext, we solve for the amount of glucose in the intestine, $I(t)$. We substitute the expression for $S(t)$ into the second ODE:\n$$\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} = k_{empt} [D\\,\\exp(-k_{empt} t)] - k_{abs} I(t)$$\nRearranging this gives a first-order, non-homogeneous linear ODE:\n$$\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + k_{abs} I(t) = D\\,k_{empt}\\,\\exp(-k_{empt} t)$$\nThis equation can be solved using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor $\\mu(t)$ is:\n$$\\mu(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{abs} \\,dt\\right) = \\exp(k_{abs} t)$$\nMultiplying the ODE by $\\mu(t)$ gives:\n$$\\exp(k_{abs} t)\\frac{dI(t)}{dt} + k_{abs}\\exp(k_{abs} t) I(t) = D\\,k_{empt}\\,\\exp(-k_{empt} t)\\exp(k_{abs} t)$$\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $I(t)\\mu(t)$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left[I(t)\\exp(k_{abs} t)\\right] = D\\,k_{empt}\\,\\exp((k_{abs} - k_{empt})t)$$\nWe integrate both sides with respect to $t$. The provided parameters are $k_{empt} = 0.03$ and $k_{abs} = 0.06$, so $k_{abs} \\neq k_{empt}$.\n$$I(t)\\exp(k_{abs} t) = \\int D\\,k_{empt}\\,\\exp((k_{abs} - k_{empt})t) \\,dt$$\n$$I(t)\\exp(k_{abs} t) = \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\exp((k_{abs} - k_{empt})t) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find $C$, we use the initial condition $I(0) = 0$:\n$$I(0)\\exp(0) = \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\exp(0) + C$$\n$$0 = \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}$$\nSubstituting $C$ back and solving for $I(t)$ by dividing by $\\exp(k_{abs} t)$:\n$$I(t) = \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\exp(-k_{empt} t) - \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\exp(-k_{abs} t)$$\n$$I(t) = \\frac{D\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\left(\\exp(-k_{empt} t) - \\exp(-k_{abs} t)\\right)$$\nThis is the expression for the glucose content in the intestine over time.\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the rate of appearance, $R_{a}(t)$:\n$$R_{a}(t) = f_{bio}\\,k_{abs}\\,I(t) = \\frac{f_{bio}\\,D\\,k_{abs}\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}\\left(\\exp(-k_{empt} t) - \\exp(-k_{abs} t)\\right)$$\nTo find the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which $R_{a}(t)$ is maximum, we must find the critical points by setting its first derivative with respect to time to zero. Let the constant term be $A = \\frac{f_{bio}\\,D\\,k_{abs}\\,k_{empt}}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}$.\n$$\\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} = A \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\exp(-k_{empt} t) - \\exp(-k_{abs} t)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} = A \\left(-k_{empt}\\exp(-k_{empt} t) - (-k_{abs})\\exp(-k_{abs} t)\\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dR_{a}(t)}{dt} = A \\left(k_{abs}\\exp(-k_{abs} t) - k_{empt}\\exp(-k_{empt} t)\\right)$$\nSet the derivative to zero to find $t^{\\ast}$. Since $A \\neq 0$:\n$$k_{abs}\\exp(-k_{abs} t^{\\ast}) - k_{empt}\\exp(-k_{empt} t^{\\ast}) = 0$$\n$$k_{abs}\\exp(-k_{abs} t^{\\ast}) = k_{empt}\\exp(-k_{empt} t^{\\ast})$$\nRearrange to solve for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\frac{k_{abs}}{k_{empt}} = \\frac{\\exp(-k_{empt} t^{\\ast})}{\\exp(-k_{abs} t^{\\ast})} = \\exp(-k_{empt} t^{\\ast} + k_{abs} t^{\\ast}) = \\exp((k_{abs} - k_{empt})t^{\\ast})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{abs}}{k_{empt}}\\right) = (k_{abs} - k_{empt})t^{\\ast}$$\nFinally, we obtain the symbolic expression for the peak time:\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{abs}}{k_{empt}}\\right)}{k_{abs} - k_{empt}}$$\nNote that the peak time $t^{\\ast}$ depends only on the rate constants $k_{empt}$ and $k_{abs}$, not on the dose $D$ or the bioavailability $f_{bio}$.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $t^{\\ast}$:\n$k_{empt} = 0.03 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n$k_{abs} = 0.06 \\text{ min}^{-1}$\n\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.06}{0.03}\\right)}{0.06 - 0.03}$$\n$$t^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{0.03} \\quad (\\text{minutes})$$\n\nUsing the value $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx \\frac{0.69314718}{0.03} \\approx 23.104906 \\text{ minutes}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$t^{\\ast} \\approx 23.10 \\text{ minutes}$$\nThe second derivative test confirms this is a maximum. As shown in the thought process, $\\frac{d^2R_a}{dt^2}|_{t=t^*} = A \\cdot k_{abs} (k_{empt}-k_{abs}) \\exp(-k_{abs} t^*) < 0$ since $A>0$ and $k_{empt} < k_{abs}$.",

Let $G(t)$ denote plasma glucose concentration and $X(t)$ denote insulin action (an effect-compartment variable). Under fasting conditions, with exogenous inputs absent and insulin clamped at basal so that deviations in insulin drive are zero, the glucose dynamics can be described by a first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) in which glucose effectiveness $S_G$ quantifies the ability of glucose per se to promote its own disposal, and insulin action $X$ modulates glucose disappearance multiplicatively.

The states are plasma glucose concentration, $G(t)$, and insulin action, $X(t)$.\n\nFirst, we formalize the system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the problem statement. Let the system be described by:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt} = f_1(G, X) $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = f_2(G, X) $$\n\nThe dynamics of insulin action $X(t)$ are described as a first-order decay toward its basal value of $0$, with a rate constant $k_x$. The problem also states that insulin is clamped at its basal level, meaning there is no external or internal stimulus driving insulin action away from its decay-driven trajectory. This implies that the equation for $X$ is autonomous and depends only on $X$ itself. Thus, we can write:\n$$ f_2(G, X) = \\frac{dX}{dt} = -k_x X(t) $$\n\nThe dynamics of glucose $G(t)$ are determined by its production and disposal. The problem states that glucose effectiveness, $S_G$, quantifies the ability of glucose *per se* to promote its own disposal. This is standardly modeled as a process where the rate of disposal is proportional to the deviation of glucose from its basal concentration, $G_b$. This contributes a term of the form $-S_G(G(t) - G_b)$ to $\\frac{dG}{dt}$. Furthermore, insulin action $X(t)$ is said to modulate glucose disappearance multiplicatively. In the context of the minimal model, this corresponds to an insulin-mediated glucose uptake term proportional to the product of insulin action and glucose concentration, $-X(t)G(t)$. Combining these effects with an assumed constant basal glucose production that exactly balances basal disposal, we arrive at the standard model equation for glucose dynamics under these conditions:\n$$ f_1(G, X) = \\frac{dG}{dt} = -S_G(G(t) - G_b) - X(t)G(t) $$\n\nThe complete nonlinear system is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dt} = -S_G(G - G_b) - X G $$\n$$ \\frac{dX}{dt} = -k_x X $$\n\nWe must verify that the specified basal steady state, $(G, X) = (G_b, 0)$, is indeed a fixed point of this system.

We define the small deviation variables $g(t) = G(t) - G_b$ and $x(t) = X(t) - 0 = X(t)$. The dynamics of these small deviations are approximated by the linear system:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\begin{pmatrix} g \\\\ x \\end{pmatrix} = J \\begin{pmatrix} g \\\\ x \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $J$ is the Jacobian matrix of the system evaluated at the steady state $(G_b, 0)$.
