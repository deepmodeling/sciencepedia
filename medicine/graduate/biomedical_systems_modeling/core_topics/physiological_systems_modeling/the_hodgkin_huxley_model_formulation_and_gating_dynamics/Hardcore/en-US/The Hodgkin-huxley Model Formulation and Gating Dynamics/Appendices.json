This exercise strips the system down to its simplest form, where all ionic channels are blocked, allowing us to isolate and observe how the membrane charges in response to a constant applied current. By working through this foundational scenario , you will build an intuitive grasp of the relationship between current, capacitance, and the rate of change of membrane potential ($V$), which is the canvas upon which all neuronal signaling is painted.",

            "solution": "The user-provided problem is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of membrane biophysics, is well-posed as a first-order initial value problem, and is stated objectively with all necessary information provided.\n\nThe derivation of the membrane voltage, $V(t)$, proceeds from the fundamental principle of conservation of charge, as expressed by Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) for a membrane patch. The total current density flowing across the membrane is the sum of the capacitive current density, $I_C(t)$, and the ionic current density, $I_{\\mathrm{ion}}(t)$. This total membrane current density must be equal to the externally applied current density, $I_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The governing equation per unit area is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = I_C(t) + I_{\\mathrm{ion}}(t)$$\n\nThe problem states that all voltage-gated ionic channels are pharmacologically blocked, which implies that the ionic conductances are zero. Consequently, the total ionic current density is zero for all time $t$:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{ion}}(t) = 0$$\n\nUnder this condition, the KCL equation simplifies to:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = I_C(t)$$\n\nThe problem also specifies that the membrane behaves as a capacitor, with the constitutive relation for the capacitive current density given by:\n$$I_C(t) = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nwhere $C_m$ is the area-specific membrane capacitance and $V(t)$ is the membrane voltage.\n\nSubstituting the capacitive current relation into the simplified KCL equation yields the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs the membrane voltage dynamics under these specific conditions:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{app}} = C_m \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\n\nThe applied current density, $I_{\\mathrm{app}}$, is given as a constant value. We can rearrange the ODE to solve for $V(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m}$$\n\nThis is a separable differential equation. We integrate both sides with respect to time from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$. The voltage is integrated from its initial value $V(0)$ to its value at time $t$, $V(t)$:\n$$\\int_{V(0)}^{V(t)} dV' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m} dt'$$\n\nSince $I_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and $C_m$ are constants, the integration yields:\n$$V(t) - V(0) = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m} t$$\n\nSolving for $V(t)$, we obtain the general solution for the membrane voltage:\n$$V(t) = V(0) + \\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m}\\right) t$$\n\nThe problem requires the final formula for $V(t)$ to be expressed in millivolts ($\\mathrm{mV}$) as a function of time $t$ in milliseconds ($\\mathrm{ms}$). To accomplish this, we substitute the given values and perform a unit analysis.\nThe given parameters are:\n- $C_m = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F/cm}^2 = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}^2$\n- $I_{\\mathrm{app}} = 5\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A/cm}^2 = 5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}^2$\n- $V(0) = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m}$:\n$$\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{app}}}{C_m} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A/cm}^2}{1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F/cm}^2} = 5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{F}}$$\nRecalling the definitions of the Ampere ($A = C/s$) and Farad ($F = C/V$), the unit of this ratio becomes:\n$$5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{F}} = 5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{C/s}}{\\mathrm{C/V}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{V/s}$$\nSo the rate of change of voltage is $5$ Volts per second. The equation for $V(t)$ in Volts and $t$ in seconds is:\n$$V(t)|_{\\text{in V}} = (-65 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}) + (5\\,\\mathrm{V/s}) \\cdot t|_{\\text{in s}}$$\n\nTo convert this to the desired units of millivolts and milliseconds, we can convert the rate of change:\n$$5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{V}}{\\mathrm{s}} = 5\\,\\frac{10^3\\,\\mathrm{mV}}{10^3\\,\\mathrm{ms}} = 5\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{mV}}{\\mathrm{ms}}$$\nThus, the rate of voltage change is $5$ millivolts per millisecond. Let $V$ now represent the voltage in $\\mathrm{mV}$ and $t$ represent the time in $\\mathrm{ms}$. The differential equation in these units is:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dt} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mV/ms}$$\nIntegrating this equation with the initial condition $V(0) = -65\\,\\mathrm{mV}$ gives:\n$$V(t) = -65 + 5t$$\nwhere $V(t)$ is in millivolts and $t$ is in milliseconds. This linear relationship shows that the constant applied current charges the membrane capacitor at a constant rate, causing the voltage to increase linearly with time. This formula is valid for the specified interval $t \\in [0, 2\\,\\mathrm{ms}]$ and beyond, as long as the conditions hold.",

It is scientifically grounded in the well-established Hodgkin-Huxley model of neurophysiology, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated with objective, precise language.\n\nThe problem concerns the gating of the sodium channel as described by the Hodgkin-Huxley model. The channel's conductance is controlled by three identical and independent activation gates and one inactivation gate. Let $m$ be the probability that a single activation gate is in its open (permissive) state, and let $h$ be the probability that the single inactivation gate is in its open state.\n\nFor the channel to be conducting, all gates must be simultaneously in their permissive states. The problem states that the gates are independent. Based on first principles of probability, the probability of multiple independent events occurring simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nThe probability that all three activation gates are open is the product of their individual probabilities: $m \\times m \\times m = m^3$.\nThe probability that the inactivation gate is open is $h$.\nThe gating factor, $f(m,h)$, is the overall probability that the channel is in a conducting state. This requires all $3$ activation gates and the $1$ inactivation gate to be open.

These sensitivities are defined as the partial derivatives of the gating factor $f(m,h)$ with respect to $m$ and $h$.\n\nThe sensitivity with respect to $m$, denoted $S_m$, is the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $m$:\n$$S_m = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial m}(m^3 h)$$\nTreating $h$ as a constant for this differentiation, we apply the power rule:\n$$S_m = 3m^2 h$$\n\nThe sensitivity with respect to $h$, denoted $S_h$, is the partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $h$:\n$$S_h = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial h} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial h}(m^3 h)$$\nTreating $m^3$ as a constant for this differentiation:\n$$S_h = m^3$$\n\nNext, we evaluate these sensitivities at the given operating point, $m=0.8$ and $h=0.5$:\n$$S_m(0.8, 0.5) = 3(0.8)^2 (0.5) = 3(0.64)(0.5) = 1.92 \\times 0.5 = 0.96$$\n$$S_h(0.8, 0.5) = (0.8)^3 = 0.512$$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as $R = \\frac{S_m}{S_h}$.

The cubic dependence on $m$ ($m^3$) compared to the linear dependence on $h$ amplifies the influence of the activation gates on the channel's overall probability of being open.\n\nThe final numerical values required are for $f(0.8, 0.5)$ and $R$.\n$$f(0.8, 0.5) = 0.2560$$\n$$R = 1.875$$\nThese are to be presented as a single row vector.",
