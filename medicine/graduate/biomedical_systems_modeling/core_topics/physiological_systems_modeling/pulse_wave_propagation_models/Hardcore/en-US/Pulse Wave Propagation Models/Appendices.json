The assumption of constant distensibility is a common and valid simplification for modeling pressure-area relationships over small pressure ranges, leading to the well-known exponential tube law. The provided numerical values for $A_0$, $\\Delta P$, and $D$ are physiologically realistic for a large artery. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, providing all necessary information to solve a first-order ordinary differential equation with an initial condition. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria specified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Pressure-Area Relationship**\n\nThe starting point is the definition of areal distensibility, $D$, which is assumed to be constant:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{A}\\frac{dA}{dP}\n$$\nThis is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $A$ and $P$:\n$$\nD \\, dP = \\frac{1}{A} \\, dA\n$$\nTo find the functional relationship $A(P)$, we integrate both sides. We integrate from a known reference state $(P_0, A_0)$ to an arbitrary state $(P, A)$:\n$$\n\\int_{P_0}^{P} D \\, dP' = \\int_{A_0}^{A} \\frac{1}{A'} \\, dA'\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the integral on the left-hand side:\n$$\nD \\int_{P_0}^{P} dP' = \\int_{A_0}^{A} \\frac{1}{A'} \\, dA'\n$$\nPerforming the integration on both sides yields:\n$$\nD [P']_{P_0}^{P} = [\\ln(A')]_{A_0}^{A}\n$$\n$$\nD (P - P_0) = \\ln(A) - \\ln(A_0)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, $\\ln(a) - \\ln(b) = \\ln(a/b)$, we have:\n$$\nD (P - P_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{A}{A_0}\\right)\n$$\nTo solve for $A$ as a function of $P$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\exp(D (P - P_0)) = \\frac{A}{A_0}\n$$\nThus, the functional dependence of the cross-sectional area $A$ on the transmural pressure $P$ is:\n$$\nA(P) = A_0 \\exp(D(P - P_0))\n$$\n\n**Computation of the Change in Area $\\Delta A$**\n\nWe need to compute the change in cross-sectional area, $\\Delta A$, resulting from a pressure increment $\\Delta P = 10\\,\\text{mmHg}$ above the reference pressure $P_0$.\nThe initial area at pressure $P_0$ is $A_0$. The final pressure is $P_f = P_0 + \\Delta P$. The final area, $A_f$, is found by evaluating $A(P_f)$:\n$$\nA_f = A(P_0 + \\Delta P) = A_0 \\exp(D((P_0 + \\Delta P) - P_0))\n$$\n$$\nA_f = A_0 \\exp(D \\Delta P)\n$$\nThe change in area, $\\Delta A$, is the difference between the final area and the initial area:\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_f - A_0 = A_0 \\exp(D \\Delta P) - A_0\n$$\nFactoring out $A_0$, we get the expression for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = A_0 (\\exp(D \\Delta P) - 1)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $A_0 = 1\\,\\text{cm}^2$, $D = 2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$, and $\\Delta P = 10\\,\\text{mmHg}$.\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless product $D \\Delta P$:\n$$\nD \\Delta P = (2 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (10\\,\\text{mmHg}) = 2 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.002\n$$\nNow, we substitute this value into the expression for $\\Delta A$:\n$$\n\\Delta A = (1\\,\\text{cm}^2) \\times (\\exp(0.002) - 1)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the exponential term:\n$$\n\\exp(0.002) \\approx 1.002002000667\n$$\nSubtracting $1$:\n$$\n\\exp(0.002) - 1 \\approx 0.002002000667\n$$\nTherefore, the change in area is:\n$$\n\\Delta A \\approx (1\\,\\text{cm}^2) \\times 0.002002000667 = 0.002002000667\\,\\text{cm}^2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first significant figure is the first non-zero digit, which is $2$. The four significant figures are $2$, $0$, $0$, and $2$. The digit following the fourth significant figure is $0$, so we round down.\n$$\n\\Delta A \\approx 0.002002\\,\\text{cm}^2\n$$\n\n**Physiological Interpretation**\n\nThe computed change in area, $\\Delta A$, quantifies the elastic distension of the artery in response to the pressure pulse. This compliance allows large arteries to store a portion of the blood volume ejected by the heart during systole, smoothing blood flow into the periphery and reducing the work of the heart. The distensibility from which this area change is calculated is a fundamental property governing the speed of the pulse wave (pulse wave velocity), a key indicator of arterial stiffness and cardiovascular health.",

It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)\n\nThe derivation is based on the one-dimensional equations for conservation of mass and momentum in a deformable tube, coupled with an equation describing the tube's elastic properties (a \"tube law\").\n\nLet $A(x, t)$ be the cross-sectional area of the artery, $u(x, t)$ be the axial fluid velocity, and $P(x, t)$ be the pressure, all functions of axial position $x$ and time $t$. The fluid density $\\rho$ is constant.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)**\n    For an inviscid, incompressible fluid in a tube of changing area, the 1D continuity equation is:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial (Au)}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n    Expanding the second term:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial t} + A \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + u \\frac{\\partial A}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n\n2.  **Conservation of Momentum (Euler's Equation)**\n    For an inviscid fluid, the 1D momentum equation is:\n    $$ \\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\right) = - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial x} $$\n\n3.  **Linearization for Small Perturbations**\n    The problem specifies small perturbations around a reference state of zero flow ($u_0 = 0$) and constant reference radius $R$ and area $A_0 = \\pi R^2$. We define the perturbations as:\n    $A(x, t) = A_0 + a'(x, t)$\n    $u(x, t) = u'(x, t)$\n    $P(x, t) = P_0 + p'(x, t)$\n    Substituting these into the governing equations and dropping terms of second order in the small\n    perturbations (e.g., $u' \\frac{\\partial a'}{\\partial x}$, $(u')^2$) yields the linearized equations:\n\n    Linearized Continuity:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial a'}{\\partial t} + A_0 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} = 0 $$\n\n    Linearized Momentum:\n    $$ \\rho \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} $$\n\n4.  **Tube Law (Elastic Properties)**\n    We need a relationship between the change in pressure $p'$ and the change in area $a'$. We model the artery as a thin-walled elastic cylinder. The hoop stress $\\sigma_\\theta$ is given by the circumferential force balance:\n    $$ \\sigma_\\theta = \\frac{P r}{h} $$\n    where $P$ is the transmural pressure and $r$ is the instantaneous radius. The circumferential strain $\\epsilon_\\theta$ relative to the reference radius $R$ is:\n    $$ \\epsilon_\\theta = \\frac{r - R}{R} $$\n    The wall is linearly elastic, so stress is proportional to strain via Young's modulus $E$:\n    $$ \\sigma_\\theta = E \\epsilon_\\theta $$\n    Combining these gives:\n    $$ \\frac{P r}{h} = E \\frac{r - R}{R} $$\n    To linearize this relation, we consider small changes $r = R + r'$ and $P = P_0 + p'$, where $p'$ causes $r'$.\n    $$ \\frac{(P_0 + p')(R + r')}{h} = E \\frac{r'}{R} $$\n    Assuming the pressure-induced stress is much larger than the pre-stress effect (a standard simplification, equivalent to $P_0 \\ll Eh/R$) and dropping second-order terms ($p'r'$), we get:\n    $$ \\frac{p' R}{h} \\approx E \\frac{r'}{R} \\implies p' \\approx \\frac{Eh}{R^2} r' $$\n    Now, we relate the radius change $r'$ to the area change $a'$.\n    $A = \\pi r^2 \\implies dA = 2 \\pi r dr$. For small perturbations, $a' \\approx 2 \\pi R r'$. Thus, $r' \\approx \\frac{a'}{2 \\pi R}$.\n    Substituting $r'$ into the pressure relation:\n    $$ p' \\approx \\frac{Eh}{R^2} \\left( \\frac{a'}{2 \\pi R} \\right) = \\frac{Eh}{2 \\pi R^3} a' $$\n    This provides the linear tube law relating pressure and area perturbations, which can be expressed in terms of derivatives as:\n    $$ \\frac{dp'}{da'} = \\frac{Eh}{2 \\pi R^3} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{da'}{dp'} = \\frac{2 \\pi R^3}{Eh} $$\n\n5.  **Derivation of the Wave Equation**\n    We now have a system of three equations:\n    (i) $\\frac{\\partial a'}{\\partial t} = -A_0 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x}$\n    (ii) $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = -\\rho \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}$\n    (iii) $a' = \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi R^3}{Eh}\\right) p'$\n\n    From (iii), we can write $\\frac{\\partial a'}{\\partial t} = \\frac{2 \\pi R^3}{Eh} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}$. Substitute this into (i), along with $A_0 = \\pi R^2$:\n    $$ \\frac{2 \\pi R^3}{Eh} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t} = -(\\pi R^2) \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} \\implies \\frac{2 R}{Eh} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t} = - \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} $$\n    Now, differentiate this equation with respect to $t$ and the linearized momentum equation (ii) with respect to $x$:\n    $$ \\frac{2 R}{Eh} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = - \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial x \\partial t} $$\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = - \\rho \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} $$\n    Assuming the functions are sufficiently smooth, the order of differentiation can be interchanged ($\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial x \\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x}$). We can equate the expressions for the mixed partial derivative:\n    $$ \\frac{2 R}{Eh} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} $$\n    Rearranging this into the standard form of the one-dimensional wave equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}$, we get:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = \\left(\\frac{Eh}{2 \\rho R}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} $$\n    By comparison, the square of the wave propagation speed $c$ is:\n    $$ c^2 = \\frac{Eh}{2 \\rho R} $$\n    Thus, the pulse wave velocity is given by the Moens-Korteweg equation:\n    $$ c = \\sqrt{\\frac{Eh}{2 \\rho R}} $$\n\n### Scaling of PWV with Young's Modulus\nThe derived formula shows that the pulse wave velocity $c$ is proportional to the square root of the Young's modulus $E$:\n$$ c \\propto \\sqrt{E} $$\nThis relationship implies that as the arterial wall becomes stiffer (i.e., $E$ increases), the pulse wave travels faster. This is consistent with clinical observations where arterial stiffening due to aging or disease leads to an increased PWV.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe given baseline values are:\n$E_{base} = 0.6\\,\\text{MPa} = 0.6 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{Pa}$\n$h = 1.2\\,\\text{mm} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n$R = 4\\,\\text{mm} = 4 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n$\\rho = 1050\\,\\text{kg/m}^3$\n\nArterial aging causes a $20\\%$ increase in $E$.

            "solution": "The modeling foundation is the one-dimensional (1D) linearized equations for pulse wave propagation in compliant vessels, obtained from conservation of mass and conservation of momentum for incompressible flow in deformable tubes. In the frequency domain under small perturbations around a steady state, these yield wave equations supporting forward and backward traveling waves of pressure and flow. The wave speed and characteristic impedance depend on wall mechanics and geometry.\n\nFundamental base:\n- Conservation of mass implies that cross-sectional area changes and axial flow variations are related, and conservation of momentum provides the relation between pressure gradients and acceleration of the fluid.\n- For thin-walled, axisymmetric tubes, the Moens-Korteweg wave speed is $c_i = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{E_i h_i}{2\\rho R_i}}$, where $E_i$ is Young's modulus, $h_i$ is wall thickness, $\\rho$ is fluid density, and $R_i$ is radius. This formula is a well-tested relationship for pulse wave velocity in arteries under the thin-wall approximation.\n- The characteristic impedance is $Z_{c,i} = \\dfrac{\\rho c_i}{A_i}$, where $A_i = \\pi R_i^2$ is the cross-sectional area. This impedance relates pressure and flow for a single traveling wave in a uniform tube.\n- In the frequency domain with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, the wavenumber is $k_i = \\omega/c_i$. Assuming negligible viscous damping at the scale of interest and small amplitude waves (lossless approximation), the propagation of forward and backward waves over a length $L_i$ is described by multiplicative phase factors $\\exp(\\pm j k_i L_i)$.\n\nTransmission line relations:\n- For a uniform segment $i$ with characteristic impedance $Z_{c,i}$ and wavenumber $k_i$, let $P_i(x)$ and $Q_i(x)$ be the complex pressure and flow phasors. The general solution can be written as $P_i(x) = P_i^+ e^{-j k_i x} + P_i^- e^{j k_i x}$ and $Q_i(x) = \\dfrac{1}{Z_{c,i}}\\left(P_i^+ e^{-j k_i x} - P_i^- e^{j k_i x}\\right)$, where $P_i^+$ and $P_i^-$ are the forward and backward pressure wave amplitudes at the proximal end ($x=0$).\n- At the distal end ($x=L_i$), the load impedance $Z_{\\text{load}}$ imposes $P_i(L_i) = Z_{\\text{load}}\\,Q_i(L_i)$. This termination condition relates $P_i^-$ at $x=L_i$ to $P_i^+$ at $x=L_i$ through the local reflection coefficient $\\Gamma = \\dfrac{Z_{\\text{load}} - Z_{c,i}}{Z_{\\text{load}} + Z_{c,i}}$. The backward wave at the proximal end satisfies $P_i^- (0) = \\Gamma e^{-2 j k_i L_i} P_i^+ (0)$, which we denote using the round-trip factor $R = \\Gamma e^{-2 j k_i L_i}$.\n- The input impedance at the proximal end, defined as $Z_{\\text{in},i} = P_i(0)/Q_i(0)$, follows $Z_{\\text{in},i} = Z_{c,i}\\dfrac{1 + R}{1 - R}$ by combining the forward/backward decomposition with the termination condition. This recursion allows computation of input impedances from distal to proximal ends.\n\nJunction conditions:\n- At a bifurcation, pressure is continuous across branches and flows sum: if the node pressure is $P_{\\text{node}}$ and the daughter input impedances are $Z_{\\text{in},a}$ and $Z_{\\text{in},b}$, then the equivalent load seen by the parent is the parallel combination $Z_{\\text{load}} = \\left(\\dfrac{1}{Z_{\\text{in},a}} + \\dfrac{1}{Z_{\\text{in},b}}\\right)^{-1}$. The parent segment uses this $Z_{\\text{load}}$ to form its reflection coefficient and input impedance, as above. The flows entering the daughters are $Q_a = P_{\\text{node}}/Z_{\\text{in},a}$ and $Q_b = P_{\\text{node}}/Z_{\\text{in},b}$, consistent with flow continuity and linearity.\n\nAlgorithmic steps:\n1. For each test case, compute $h_i = \\alpha R_i$, areas $A_i$, wave speeds $c_i = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{E_i h_i}{2\\rho R_i}}$, characteristic impedances $Z_{c,i} = \\dfrac{\\rho c_i}{A_i}$, and wavenumbers $k_i = \\omega/c_i$ for all seven segments $i=0,\\ldots,6$.\n2. Compute input impedances recursively starting from the four terminal segments ($i=3,4,5,6$). For each terminal, the load impedance is the given resistance $R_{\\text{term}}$, and the reflection coefficient is $\\Gamma_i = \\dfrac{R_{\\text{term}} - Z_{c,i}}{R_{\\text{term}} + Z_{c,i}}$. The round-trip factor is $R_i = \\Gamma_i e^{-2 j k_i L_i}$, and the input impedance is $Z_{\\text{in},i} = Z_{c,i}\\dfrac{1 + R_i}{1 - R_i}$.\n3. At the second-generation bifurcations (sites $1$ and $2$), form the parallel load $Z_{\\text{load}}$ from the two daughter input impedances and compute the corresponding reflection coefficients and input impedances for segments $i=1$ and $i=2$ using the same formula.\n4. At the first-generation bifurcation (site $0$), form the parallel load from $Z_{\\text{in},1}$ and $Z_{\\text{in},2}$ and compute the reflection coefficient and input impedance for the root segment $i=0$.\n5. With the root input impedance $Z_{\\text{in},0}$, compute the inlet flow $Q_{\\text{in}} = P_{\\text{in}}/Z_{\\text{in},0}$. Decompose the root proximal pressure and flow into forward and backward waves: $P_0^+ = \\dfrac{P_{\\text{in}} + Z_{c,0} Q_{\\text{in}}}{2}$ and $P_0^- = \\dfrac{P_{\\text{in}} - Z_{c,0} Q_{\\text{in}}}{2}$. Propagate to the distal end: $P_{\\text{node},0} = P_0^+ e^{-j k_0 L_0} + P_0^- e^{j k_0 L_0}$.\n6. Use $P_{\\text{node},0}$ to determine proximal flows into the left and right daughters: $Q_1(0) = \\dfrac{P_{\\text{node},0}}{Z_{\\text{in},1}}$ and $Q_2(0) = \\dfrac{P_{\\text{node},0}}{Z_{\\text{in},2}}$. For each daughter segment, similarly decompose the proximal state into forward and backward waves and propagate to obtain its distal node pressure $P_{\\text{node},1}$ and $P_{\\text{node},2}$.\n7. At each terminal segment, apply the same decomposition with proximal state $P_{\\text{node}}$ and $Q(0) = \\dfrac{P_{\\text{node}}}{Z_{\\text{in}}}$ to compute distal pressure $P(L)$, and then the terminal load flow $Q_{\\text{term}} = \\dfrac{P(L)}{R_{\\text{term}}}$, which equals the segment distal flow by continuity at the termination.\n8. Compute the local reflection coefficient magnitude $|\\Gamma|$ at each distal site (three junctions and four terminals) using $\\Gamma = \\dfrac{Z_{\\text{load}} - Z_c}{Z_{\\text{load}} + Z_c}$ with $Z_{\\text{load}}$ defined per site; collect all seven magnitudes and determine the maximum value and which site indices satisfy $|\\Gamma| \\ge \\tau$.\n9. Report the magnitudes $|Q_{\\text{in}}|$ and $|Q_{\\text{term}}|$ for terminals $3$ through $6$ in $\\text{m}^3/\\text{s}$, together with $\\max|\\Gamma|$ and the list of sites where $|\\Gamma| \\ge \\tau$. Round all floating-point values to six decimal places and format the output as a single bracketed list with no spaces.\n\nScientific realism and plausibility:\n- The chosen radii, lengths, and material properties are within physiological ranges for medium-sized arteries.\n- The Moens-Korteweg wave speed and characteristic impedance are widely accepted for small-amplitude waves in thin-walled tubes.\n- The frequency range $1$ to $4\\,\\text{Hz}$ corresponds to heart rates and harmonics.\n- Resistive terminal loads represent microcirculatory impedances at the distal end.\n\nThis design ensures the algorithm adheres to first principles (conservation laws, wave decomposition, wall mechanics) and produces quantifiable outputs for a diverse test suite, covering symmetric, near-matched, and asymmetric networks. The final program computes the requested quantities, identifies major reflection sites using the specified threshold, and prints the results in the required single-line format with six-decimal-place rounding.",
