            "problem": "A single-nephron model is used to represent the steady-state filtration across the glomerular capillary wall as a membrane separating the glomerular capillary blood from Bowman's space. The volumetric flux is assumed proportional to the net driving pressure across the barrier, and the net driving pressure is the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic contributions acting across the barrier. Assume negligible filtration disequilibrium so that the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary remains approximately constant along the capillary length, and assume that the protein concentration in Bowman's space is negligible.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) based on a simplified model of renal filtration governed by Starling forces.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing principles. The problem states that the volumetric flux across the glomerular filtration barrier is proportional to the net driving pressure. For the entire kidney, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f \\times P_{UF}\n$$\nwhere GFR is the Glomerular Filtration Rate, $K_f$ is the whole-kidney ultrafiltration coefficient, and $P_{UF}$ is the net ultrafiltration pressure.\n\nNext, we must derive an expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure, $P_{UF}$. The problem specifies that this pressure is the algebraic sum of hydrostatic and oncotic pressures acting across the barrier between the glomerular capillary ($GC$) and Bowman's space ($BS$). These are known as Starling forces. The general form of the Starling equation for fluid flux is:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (\\text{Forces favoring filtration}) - (\\text{Forces opposing filtration})\n$$\nFiltration is the movement of fluid from the glomerular capillary into Bowman's space.\nThe forces favoring filtration are:\n$1$. The hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillary, $P_{GC}$.\n$2$. The oncotic pressure within Bowman's space, $\\pi_{BS}$. This force arises from proteins in the filtrate, which would pull water into Bowman's space.\n\nThe forces opposing filtration are:\n$1$. The hydrostatic pressure within Bowman's space, $P_{BS}$. This pressure exerts a back-pressure against the capillary wall.\n$2$. The oncotic pressure within the glomerular capillary, $\\pi_{GC}$. This force, generated by plasma proteins like albumin that are not readily filtered, tends to retain water within the capillary.\n\nCombining these forces gives the expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (P_{GC} + \\pi_{BS}) - (P_{BS} + \\pi_{GC})\n$$\nThe problem statement provides several key conditions and assumptions. One assumption is that the protein concentration in Bowman's space is negligible. This implies that the oncotic pressure in Bowman's space is zero.\n$$\n\\pi_{BS} = 0 \\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nAnother crucial assumption is that of \"negligible filtration disequilibrium,\" which means the glomerular capillary oncotic pressure, $\\pi_{GC}$, can be treated as constant along the entire length of the capillary. This simplifies the model by allowing us to use a single average value for $\\pi_{GC}$ rather than integrating over a changing pressure profile.\n\nSubstituting $\\pi_{BS} = 0$ into the equation for $P_{UF}$, we obtain the specific expression for the net ultrafiltration pressure applicable to this problem:\n$$\nP_{UF} = (P_{GC} + 0) - (P_{BS} + \\pi_{GC})\n$$\n$$\nP_{UF} = P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC}\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $P_{UF}$ back into the primary equation for GFR. This yields the derived expression for GFR based on the given first principles:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = K_f \\times (P_{GC} - P_{BS} - \\pi_{GC})\n$$\nWith the derived expression, we proceed to compute the numerical value of GFR using the provided data:\n- Glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure: $P_{GC} = 50\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Bowman's space hydrostatic pressure: $P_{BS} = 12\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Glomerular capillary oncotic pressure: $\\pi_{GC} = 20\\ \\text{mmHg}$\n- Whole-kidney ultrafiltration coefficient: $K_{f} = 12\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the net ultrafiltration pressure, $P_{UF}$:\n$$\nP_{UF} = 50\\ \\text{mmHg} - 12\\ \\text{mmHg} - 20\\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\n$$\nP_{UF} = 18\\ \\text{mmHg}\n$$\nNext, we use this value to calculate the GFR:\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = (12\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\\cdot\\text{mmHg}^{-1}) \\times (18\\ \\text{mmHg})\n$$\nThe units of mmHg cancel, leaving the result in $\\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}$ as required.\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = 12 \\times 18 \\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{GFR} = 216\\ \\text{mL}\\cdot\\text{min}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value of $216$ already has three significant figures, so no further rounding is necessary.",

            "introduction": "While $GFR$ is the gold standard of kidney function, it is typically estimated using clearance markers rather than measured directly. This exercise explores the important discrepancy between true $GFR$ and creatinine clearance ($C_{cr}$), its most common clinical estimator. You will develop a mathematical model that accounts for the contribution of tubular secretion to creatinine elimination, allowing you to quantify the resulting bias and analyze how it changes as kidney function declines .",

            "problem": "A small, freely filterable, non-protein-bound solute is eliminated by the kidney via two parallel processes: glomerular filtration and saturable transporter-mediated tubular secretion. Consider creatinine under typical physiological conditions where transporter saturation is negligible over the plasma concentration range of interest, so that the incremental contribution of secretion to whole-kidney elimination can be treated as linear in plasma concentration. Let the plasma concentration be denoted by $C_{p}$, the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) by $\\text{GFR}$, and the effective secretory clearance by $C_{s}$, defined such that the secretory excretion rate is proportional to $C_{p}$ with proportionality $C_{s}$. Creatinine clearance (first appearance definition) is the ratio of urinary excretion rate to plasma concentration and is denoted $C_{cr}$. Under steady state, total urinary excretion rate equals the sum of the filtration excretion rate and the secretion excretion rate. Starting from these mass-balance and clearance definitions, derive the expression for $C_{cr}$ in terms of $\\text{GFR}$ and $C_{s}$, and then define the dimensionless relative bias $b$ of creatinine clearance with respect to true glomerular filtration by\n$$\nb \\equiv \\frac{C_{cr}}{\\text{GFR}} - 1.\n$$\nGiven that creatinine secretion adds an effective secretory clearance $C_{s} = 15\\ \\text{mL}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$, compute the values of $b$ for $\\text{GFR} = 60\\ \\text{mL}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$ and for $\\text{GFR} = 120\\ \\text{mL}\\,\\text{min}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "Let the total urinary excretion rate of creatinine be denoted by $E_{R}$. According to the problem statement, this total rate is the sum of the filtration rate and the secretion rate.\n\nThe filtration rate is the rate at which creatinine is filtered through the glomeruli.
