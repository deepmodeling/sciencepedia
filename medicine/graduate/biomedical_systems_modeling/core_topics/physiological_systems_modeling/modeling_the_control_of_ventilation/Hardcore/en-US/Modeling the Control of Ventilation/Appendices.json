            "problem": "A single-compartment lung model is used to represent the mechanics of spontaneous breathing driven by respiratory muscle pressure, denoted as $P_{\\mathrm{mus}}(t)$. In this model, the airway opening is exposed to atmospheric pressure, and the respiratory muscles must generate the pressure needed to overcome lung elastance, denoted $E_L$, and airway resistance, denoted $R_L$, while moving a tidal volume $V_T$ over an inspiratory time $T_I$. The lung elastance is related to the static compliance $C_L$ by $E_L = 1/C_L$. The work of breathing per cycle done by the muscles is defined as\n$$\nW \\;=\\; \\oint P_{\\mathrm{mus}}\\, dV,\n$$\nwhere the integral is taken over the full breathing cycle. Assume expiration is entirely passive with $P_{\\mathrm{mus}}(t)=0$ during expiration, and there is no external positive end-expiratory pressure.

We can determine the other post-resection steady-state variables. From the alveolar gas equation:\n$$P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}} = R \\big( P_{I\\mathrm{O_2}} - P_{a\\mathrm{O_2}, \\text{post}} \\big) = 0.8 \\times (150 - 100) = 0.8 \\times 50 = 40\\,\\text{mmHg}$$\nThis implies that $P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}} = P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{pre}}$.\n\nFrom the alveolar ventilation equation, since $P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}}$ remains unchanged:\n$$\\dot V_{A, \\text{post}} = \\frac{K\\,\\dot V_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}{P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}}} = \\frac{863 \\times 0.2}{40} = 4.315\\,\\text{L/min}$$\nThis implies that $\\dot V_{A, \\text{post}} = \\dot V_{A, \\text{pre}}$.\nTherefore, the condition that $P_{a\\mathrm{O_2}}$ is held constant forces the entire ventilatory steady state ($\\dot V_A$, $P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}}$, $P_{a\\mathrm{O_2}}$) to remain identical to the pre-resection state.\n\nWe now use the post-resection control law (4) at this new steady state, substituting the now-known values for all variables except $\\mu$:\n$$\\dot V_{A, \\text{post}} = V_b + \\mu\\,G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}}-C_c\\big)$$\n$$4.315 = 4.815 + \\mu \\times 0.5 \\times (40 - 45)$$\n$$4.315 = 4.815 + \\mu \\times 0.5 \\times (-5)$$\n$$4.315 = 4.815 - 2.5\\mu$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\mu$:\n$$2.5\\mu = 4.815 - 4.315$$\n$$2.5\\mu = 0.5$$\n$$\\mu = \\frac{0.5}{2.5} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2$$\n\nAlternatively, we can solve for $\\mu$ symbolically. The pre-resection control law gives the total chemoreflex drive as $\\dot V_{A, \\text{pre}} - V_b = G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{pre}}-C_c\\big)+G_p\\big(O_p-P_{a\\mathrm{O_2}, \\text{pre}}\\big)$.\nThe post-resection control law must produce the same total ventilation, so the post-resection chemoreflex drive must also equal $\\dot V_{A, \\text{pre}} - V_b$.\nThus, $\\mu\\,G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}}-C_c\\big) = G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{pre}}-C_c\\big)+G_p\\big(O_p-P_{a\\mathrm{O_2}, \\text{pre}}\\big)$.\nSince the steady-state gas pressures are unchanged ($P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{post}}=P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}, \\text{pre}}$), the term $G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2}}-C_c\\big)$ is the same. Let's call the pre-resection steady state pressures $P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2},ss}$ and $P_{a\\mathrm{O_2},ss}$. Then:\n$$\\mu\\,G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2},ss}-C_c\\big) = G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2},ss}-C_c\\big)+G_p\\big(O_p-P_{a\\mathrm{O_2},ss}\\big)$$\nDividing by $G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2},ss}-C_c\\big)$ gives:\n$$\\mu = 1 + \\frac{G_p\\big(O_p-P_{a\\mathrm{O_2},ss}\\big)}{G_c\\big(P_{a\\mathrm{CO_2},ss}-C_c\\big)}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\mu = 1 + \\frac{0.2 \\times (110-100)}{0.5 \\times (40-45)} = 1 + \\frac{0.2 \\times 10}{0.5 \\times (-5)} = 1 + \\frac{2}{-2.5} = 1 - 0.8 = 0.2$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The value $\\mu=0.2$ is a positive dimensionless real number, satisfying the problem's constraints.",
