The state of the system can be described by the pair $(\\theta, \\omega)$, where $\\omega = \\frac{d\\theta}{dt}$ is the angular velocity. The angular coordinate $\\theta$ is defined on a circle, meaning that $\\theta$ and $\\theta + 2\\pi n$ for any integer $n$ represent the same physical state. Consequently, the phase space of this system is a cylinder, $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe omega-limit set of a trajectory is the set of points that the trajectory approaches as $t \\to \\infty$.

The entire phase space $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.",
            "solution": "To solve this problem, we will use LaSalle's Invariance Principle. First, we convert the given second-order differential equation into a system of two first-order differential equations. Let $x_1 = \\theta$ and $x_2 = \\omega = \\dot{\\theta}$. The system becomes:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_1 = x_2\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2 = -\\sin(x_1) - b x_2\n$$\nThe phase space is $(x_1, x_2) \\in S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nWe need to find a suitable Lyapunov function for this system. A natural choice is the total energy of the corresponding *undamped* system (i.e., with $b=0$). The kinetic energy is proportional to $\\frac{1}{2}\\omega^2 = \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2$, and the potential energy is proportional to $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 1 - \\cos(x_1)$. Let's define the Lyapunov function candidate $V(x_1, x_2)$ as:\n$$\nV(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}x_2^2 + 1 - \\cos(x_1)\n$$\nThis function represents the total mechanical energy. Note that $V(x_1, x_2) \\ge 0$ for all $(x_1, x_2)$, since $x_2^2 \\ge 0$ and $\\cos(x_1) \\le 1$.\n\nNext, we compute the time derivative of $V$ along the trajectories of the system. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1}\\dot{x}_1 + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2}\\dot{x}_2\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of $V$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_1} = \\sin(x_1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x_2} = x_2\n$$\nSubstituting these and the system equations for $\\dot{x}_1$ and $\\dot{x}_2$:\n$$\n\\dot{V} = (\\sin(x_1))(x_2) + (x_2)(-\\sin(x_1) - b x_2)\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V} = x_2\\sin(x_1) - x_2\\sin(x_1) - b x_2^2\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{V} = -b x_2^2\n$$\nSince the damping coefficient $b$ is given as positive ($b>0$), we have $\\dot{V} = -b x_2^2 \\le 0$ for all states $(x_1, x_2)$. This means that the energy $V$ is non-increasing along any trajectory of the system. This confirms that $V$ is a valid Lyapunov function.\n\nLaSalle's Invariance Principle states that any bounded trajectory approaches the largest invariant set contained within the set $E = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\mid \\dot{V}(x_1, x_2) = 0\\}$. The function $V$ is radially unbounded in the $x_2$ direction, which ensures that all trajectories are bounded (their energy cannot grow, so $x_2$ remains bounded, and $x_1$ is on a circle). Thus, every trajectory converges to the largest invariant set within $E$.\n\nLet's find the set $E$. The condition $\\dot{V} = 0$ implies:\n$$\n-b x_2^2 = 0 \\implies x_2 = 0\n$$\nSo, the set $E$ is the $x_1$-axis in the phase plane: $E = \\{(x_1, x_2) \\mid x_2 = 0\\}$.\n\nNow, we must find the largest invariant set contained in $E$. An invariant set is a collection of trajectories that start in the set and remain in the set for all time. We are looking for trajectories $(x_1(t), x_2(t))$ that satisfy $x_2(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nIf $x_2(t) = 0$ for all $t$, then its time derivative must also be zero, i.e., $\\dot{x}_2(t) = 0$.\nWe look at the second equation of our system:\n$$\n\\dot{x}_2 = -\\sin(x_1) - b x_2\n$$\nSubstituting $x_2=0$ and $\\dot{x}_2=0$ into this equation gives:\n$$\n0 = -\\sin(x_1) - b(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\sin(x_1) = 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied if and only if $x_1 = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\n\nTherefore, the only points in $E$ that can belong to an invariant set are those where $x_2=0$ and $x_1=n\\pi$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. This set of points is the set of equilibrium points of the system.\nLet this set be $M = \\{(n\\pi, 0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. Each point in $M$ is a trajectory (a fixed point), so $M$ is itself an invariant set. It is the largest invariant set contained in $E$.\n\nAccording to LaSalle's Invariance Principle, the omega-limit set of any trajectory must be a subset of $M$. The union of all possible omega-limit sets is therefore equal to $M$. In terms of the original variables $(\\theta, \\omega)$, this set is $\\{ (n\\pi, 0) \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}$.\n\nThis corresponds to the option:\nD. The set of all points $(\\theta, \\omega)$ of the form $(n\\pi, 0)$ for any integer $n$.\nThis set includes the stable equilibria (pendulum hanging down, $\\theta=2k\\pi$) and the unstable equilibria (pendulum balanced upright, $\\theta=(2k+1)\\pi$). All trajectories must approach one of these equilibrium points as $t \\to \\infty$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the stability of a simplified Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) respiratory system model. The core task is to verify the existence of a common quadratic Lyapunov function that guarantees stability over a specified convex set of parameters. This is to be done using a simplified and conservative certificate.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical foundation for stability analysis of the system $\\dot{x} = A(p) x$. The stability of a system can be certified by finding a Lyapunov function $V(x)$ that is positive definite ($V(x) > 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$) and whose time derivative along the system's trajectories is negative definite ($\\dot{V}(x) < 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$). For LPV systems, we seek a single, common Lyapunov function that works for all admissible parameters $p$ in a set $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nWe select a quadratic Lyapunov function candidate of the form $V(x) = x^{\\top} P x$, where $P$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix ($P = P^{\\top} \\succ 0$). The time derivative of $V(x)$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = \\frac{d}{dt}(x^{\\top} P x) = \\dot{x}^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P \\dot{x}\n$$\nSubstituting the system dynamics $\\dot{x} = A(p) x$, we get:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x) = (A(p)x)^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P (A(p) x) = x^{\\top}A(p)^{\\top} P x + x^{\\top} P A(p) x = x^{\\top} \\left( A(p)^{\\top} P + P A(p) \\right) x\n$$\nFor $\\dot{V}(x)$ to be negative definite, the matrix $A(p)^{\\top} P + P A(p)$ must be negative definite. This gives the condition for uniform asymptotic stability for all parameters $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$: there must exist a matrix $P = P^{\\top} \\succ 0$ such that the following Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) holds:\n$$\nA(p)^{\\top} P + P A(p) \\prec 0, \\quad \\forall p \\in \\mathcal{P}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the system matrix $A(p) = A_{0} + p_{1} A_{1} + p_{2} A_{2}$ depends affinely on the parameters $p = [p_1, p_2]^{\\top}$, and the parameter set $\\mathcal{P}$ is a convex polytope (a rectangular box). A key result in LPV control theory states that for such systems, the LMI only needs to be checked at the vertices of the polytope $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nLet us justify this. Let the vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$ be $p^{(1)}, p^{(2)}, \\ldots, p^{(N)}$. Any point $p \\in \\mathcal{P}$ can be expressed as a convex combination of these vertices: $p = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i p^{(i)}$, where $\\alpha_i \\geq 0$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i = 1$.\nDue to the affine dependence of $A(p)$ on $p$, we have:\n$$\nA(p) = A(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i p^{(i)}) = A_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{2} (\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i p_j^{(i)}) A_j = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i (A_0 + \\sum_{j=1}^{2} p_j^{(i)} A_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i A(p^{(i)})\n$$\nLet's define the Lyapunov matrix as $L(p) = A(p)^{\\top} P + P A(p)$. Substituting the expression for $A(p)$:\n$$\nL(p) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i A(p^{(i)})\\right)^{\\top} P + P \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i A(p^{(i)})\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i \\left(A(p^{(i)})^{\\top} P + P A(p^{(i)})\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\alpha_i L(p^{(i)})\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $L(p)$ is a convex combination of the Lyapunov matrices evaluated at the vertices, $L(p^{(i)})$. The set of negative definite matrices is a convex set. Therefore, if $L(p^{(i)}) \\prec 0$ for all vertices $i=1, \\ldots, N$, then any convex combination of these matrices will also be negative definite. Thus, checking the condition at the vertices is sufficient to guarantee its validity over the entire polytope $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\nThe problem presents a conservative simplification by fixing the Lyapunov matrix to be the identity matrix, $P = I$. The condition to check becomes:\n$$\nA(p)^{\\top} I + I A(p) \\prec 0 \\implies A(p) + A(p)^{\\top} \\prec 0\n$$\nA symmetric matrix (such as $A(p) + A(p)^{\\top}$) is negative definite if and only if all its eigenvalues are strictly negative. Therefore, the task reduces to verifying if, for each vertex $p^{(i)}$ of the parameter box, all eigenvalues of the matrix $S(p^{(i)}) = A(p^{(i)}) + A(p^{(i)})^{\\top}$ are negative.\n\nNumerically, strict negativity is tested by checking if the maximum eigenvalue of $S(p^{(i)})$ is less than a small negative threshold, i.e., $\\lambda_{\\max}(S(p^{(i)})) < -\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon = 10^{-9}$ is given.\n\nThe algorithm to solve the problem is as follows:\n1. For each of the three test cases, define the parameter box given by $p_1 \\in [p_1^{\\min}, p_1^{\\max}]$ and $p_2 \\in [p_2^{\\min}, p_2^{\\max}]$.\n2. Identify the four vertices of this box: $(p_1^{\\min}, p_2^{\\min})$, $(p_1^{\\min}, p_2^{\\max})$, $(p_1^{\\max}, p_2^{\\min})$, and $(p_1^{\\max}, p_2^{\\max})$.\n3. For each vertex $p^{(i)}$:\n    a. Construct the matrix $A(p^{(i)}) = A_{0} + p_{1}^{(i)} A_{1} + p_{2}^{(i)} A_{2}$.\n    b. Form the symmetric matrix $S(p^{(i)}) = A(p^{(i)}) + A(p^{(i)})^{\\top}$.\n    c. Compute the eigenvalues of $S(p^{(i)})$.\n    d. Find the maximum eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n    e. If $\\lambda_{\\max} \\ge -\\epsilon$, the system is not certifiably stable with $P=I$ for this vertex, and thus the entire parameter box is deemed not feasible. The check for this test case terminates with a result of `False`.\n4. If the condition $\\lambda_{\\max} < -\\epsilon$ holds for all four vertices, the parameter box is deemed feasible, and the result for the test case is `True`.\n5.
