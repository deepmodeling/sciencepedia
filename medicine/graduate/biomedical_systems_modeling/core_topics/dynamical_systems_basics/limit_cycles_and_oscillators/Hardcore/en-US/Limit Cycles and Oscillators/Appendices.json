The fixed points are found by setting $\\dot r = 0$, which gives $r=0$ or $\\alpha - r^2 = 0$. Since $r \\ge 0$ and $\\alpha  0$, the fixed points are $r=0$ and $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe stability of these fixed points for the radial dynamics is determined by the sign of $\\dot r$:\n- For $0  r  \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $r^2  \\alpha$, so $\\dot r = r(\\alpha - r^2)  0$. The radius $r$ increases.\n- For $r  \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $r^2  \\alpha$, so $\\dot r = r(\\alpha - r^2)  0$. The radius $r$ decreases.\n\nThis shows that $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ is a stable fixed point for the radial dynamics, while $r=0$ is an unstable fixed point.\nIn the full 2D system:\n- When $r(t) = \\sqrt{\\alpha}$, we have $\\dot r = 0$. The angular dynamics are $\\dot \\theta = \\omega$, which integrates to $\\theta(t) = \\theta_0 + \\omega t$. This describes a circular trajectory with radius $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ and period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$. This is a periodic orbit.\n- Since all trajectories with initial radius $r_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$ and $r_0 \\neq \\sqrt{\\alpha}$ converge to the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ as $t \\to \\infty$, this periodic orbit is asymptotically stable.\n- A limit cycle is an isolated periodic orbit. In this system, the only periodic orbit (besides the trivial fixed point at the origin) is the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Therefore, it is an isolated periodic orbit and, by definition, a limit cycle.\n- A limit cycle is hyperbolic if its Floquet multipliers are not on the unit circle (except for the one multiplier that is always $1$). The stability of the limit cycle in the direction transverse to the orbit is governed by the linearization of the radial dynamics around $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Let $f(r) = r(\\alpha-r^2)$. Then $f'(r) = \\alpha - 3r^2$. At the limit cycle, $f'(\\sqrt{\\alpha}) = \\alpha - 3\\alpha = -2\\alpha$. Since $-2\\alpha  0$, the cycle is strongly attracting. This corresponds to a Floquet multiplier $e^{-2\\alpha T} \\in (0,1)$, which is not on the unit circle. Thus, the limit cycle is hyperbolic.\n- Hyperbolic limit cycles are structurally stable. They persist under small, smooth perturbations of the vector field.\n\n**Analysis of Model C**\n\nThe system is given in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$ as:\n$$\n\\dot x = -\\omega y\n$$\n$$\n\\dot y = \\omega x\n$$\nwith $\\omega  0$. This is a linear system. To analyze its trajectories, we can convert to polar coordinates using $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$. From this, we have $r^2 = x^2+y^2$. Differentiating with respect to time:\n$$\n2r\\dot r = 2x\\dot x + 2y\\dot y \\implies r\\dot r = x(-\\omega y) + y(\\omega x) = 0\n$$\nFor $r\\neq 0$, this implies $\\dot r = 0$. The radius is constant for any trajectory.\nDifferentiating $\\tan\\theta = y/x$ with respect to time:\n$$\n(\\sec^2\\theta)\\dot\\theta = \\frac{x\\dot y - y\\dot x}{x^2} = \\frac{x(\\omega x) - y(-\\omega y)}{x^2} = \\frac{\\omega(x^2+y^2)}{x^2} = \\frac{\\omega r^2}{r^2\\cos^2\\theta} = \\omega \\sec^2\\theta\n$$\nThis implies $\\dot\\theta = \\omega$.\nSo, in polar coordinates, Model C is $\\dot r=0$, $\\dot\\theta=\\omega$.\n- For any initial condition $(x_0, y_0) \\neq (0,0)$ with initial radius $r_0 = \\sqrt{x_0^2+y_0^2}$, the trajectory is a circle of radius $r_0$ traversed with constant angular velocity $\\omega$.\n- This means there is a continuous family of periodic orbits, one for every radius $r_0  0$.\n- These periodic orbits are not isolated, so they are not limit cycles.\n- The orbits are neutrally stable (or Lyapunov stable): a small perturbation moves the system to a nearby orbit, and it stays there.\n- Such systems, called centers, are not structurally stable. A generic small perturbation will destroy the entire family of periodic orbits.\n\nWe now evaluate each option.\n\n**A. In Model L, there exists a unique periodic orbit at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ that is an isolated, asymptotically stable limit cycle (hyperbolic), and it persists under sufficiently small smooth perturbations of the vector field.**\nOur analysis of Model L confirms every part of this statement. There is a single, non-trivial periodic orbit at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. It is isolated because it is the only one. It is asymptotically stable because all nearby trajectories converge to it. It is hyperbolic because the transverse eigenvalue is non-zero (it is $-2\\alpha$). As a hyperbolic limit cycle, it is structurally stable and persists under small smooth perturbations.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. In Model C, closed trajectories exist for every $r0$, but they are not isolated; generically, an arbitrarily small dissipative perturbation of the vector field destroys all nontrivial periodic orbits by converting the center into a focus, so oscillations are not robust.**\nOur analysis of Model C showed that there is a periodic orbit (a circle) for every initial radius $r_0  0$. This is a continuum of orbits, so they are not isolated. A dissipative perturbation, such as linear damping $\\dot{x} = -\\omega y - \\epsilon x, \\dot{y} = \\omega x - \\epsilon y$ for small $\\epsilon  0$, changes the radial dynamics. We calculate $r\\dot{r} = x\\dot{x} + y\\dot{y} = x(-\\omega y - \\epsilon x) + y(\\omega x - \\epsilon y) = -\\epsilon(x^2+y^2) = -\\epsilon r^2$, which implies $\\dot{r} = -\\epsilon r$. For any $r_0  0$, the radius decays exponentially, $r(t) = r_0 e^{-\\epsilon t}$. All trajectories spiral into the origin, which becomes a stable focus. No non-trivial periodic orbits remain. This demonstrates the fragility (lack of robustness) of the oscillations in a center.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In Model C, adding weak linear damping, $\\dot x = -\\omega y - \\epsilon x,\\qquad \\dot y = \\omega x - \\epsilon y,\\qquad \\epsilon0$, yields a family of closed trajectories with slowly decaying amplitude; hence periodic orbits persist but are weakly stable.**\nThis statement is contradictory. A trajectory with decaying amplitude cannot be a closed trajectory (a periodic orbit), which by definition must return to its starting state. As shown in the analysis for option B, this perturbation leads to $\\dot r = -\\epsilon r$. For any solution starting with $r(0)  0$, the radius is strictly decreasing. Therefore, no periodic orbits exist for $r0$. The statement that \"periodic orbits persist\" is false. The system's trajectories are spirals, not closed orbits.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In Model L, if one perturbs only the angular dynamics to $\\dot r = r\\left(\\alpha - r^2\\right),\\qquad \\dot \\theta = \\omega + \\epsilon h(r,\\theta)$, with sufficiently small $\\epsilon$ and smooth $h$, then the asymptotic orbital stability of the $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ periodic orbit is destroyed even though the radial equation is unchanged.**\nThe asymptotic orbital stability of the limit cycle at $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ is determined by the behavior of trajectories near this circle. The radial dynamics, $\\dot r = r(\\alpha-r^2)$, are exclusively responsible for the attraction to the circle. Since this equation is unchanged, any trajectory starting at a radius $r_0 \\neq \\sqrt{\\alpha}$ will still have its radius converge to $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. The perturbation in $\\dot\\theta$ only changes the speed of travel along trajectories, but does not affect their tendency to approach the circle $r=\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Therefore, the asymptotic orbital stability is preserved.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. In Model C, the function $H(x,y)=\\tfrac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ is conserved; within the restricted class of small Hamiltonian perturbations that preserve a nondegenerate minimum of the Hamiltonian at the origin, a one-parameter family of nearby closed orbits persists as level sets of the perturbed Hamiltonian, so oscillations are robust within that conservative class even though they are not robust generically.**\nFor Model C, we can check the time derivative of $H(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$: $\\frac{dH}{dt} = x\\dot x + y\\dot y = x(-\\omega y) + y(\\omega x) = 0$. So $H$ is a conserved quantity. This means the system is conservative, and its trajectories are the level sets of $H$. The function $H(x,y)=\\tfrac{1}{2}(x^2+y^2)$ has a nondegenerate minimum at the origin. A small perturbation that keeps the system conservative (e.g., a Hamiltonian perturbation) will deform the conserved quantity to a new function $\\mathcal{H}_{pert}$. If $\\mathcal{H}_{pert}$ retains a nondegenerate minimum at the origin, its level sets near the origin will be a family of closed curves. These are the persistent periodic orbits. Therefore, oscillations are indeed robust within the class of conservative perturbations, which is a key distinction from generic, non-conservative perturbations.\n**Verdict: Correct**",
