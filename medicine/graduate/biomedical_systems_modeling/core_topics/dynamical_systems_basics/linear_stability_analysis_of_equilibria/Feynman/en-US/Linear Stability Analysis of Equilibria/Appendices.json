            "introduction": "Linear stability analysis provides a powerful lens for understanding the behavior of a system near its equilibrium points. For two-dimensional systems, the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix not only determine whether an equilibrium is stable or unstable but also dictate the geometry of the nearby trajectories. This exercise  allows you to explore the transition between two types of stable equilibria—a stable node and a stable spiral—by tuning a system parameter, providing a concrete link between the algebraic properties of eigenvalues and the qualitative dynamics in the phase plane.",

We will perform the requested analysis step-by-step.\n\n1.  **Identification of Equilibria**\n\nEquilibria, denoted by $x^{\\ast}$, are the values of $x$ for which the rate of change is zero, i.e., $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$. We must solve the equation $f(x^{\\ast}, \\mu) = 0$.\n$$\n\\mu x^{\\ast} - (x^{\\ast})^2 = 0\n$$\nFactoring the expression gives:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} (\\mu - x^{\\ast}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two distinct solutions for the equilibria, which depend on the parameter $\\mu$:\n-   The trivial equilibrium: $x^{\\ast}_1 = 0$. This equilibrium exists for all values of $\\mu$.\n-   The non-trivial equilibrium: $x^{\\ast}_2 = \\mu$. This equilibrium's position depends on the value of $\\mu$. Note that for $\\mu=0$, the two equilibria coincide, $x^{\\ast}_1 = x^{\\ast}_2 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Jacobian and Eigenvalues**\n\nFor a scalar (one-dimensional) system $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$, the Jacobian matrix $Df(x)$ is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix whose single entry is the derivative $\\frac{df}{dx}$. This entry is also the single eigenvalue $\\lambda$ of the linearized system. We compute this derivative for the given system:\n$$\nDf(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (\\mu x - x^2) = \\mu - 2x\n$$\nThe eigenvalue $\\lambda$ at a specific equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is given by $\\lambda = Df(x^{\\ast})$.\n\n-   For the trivial equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_1 = 0$:\nThe eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = Df(0) = \\mu - 2(0) = \\mu$.\nThe stability of this equilibrium is determined by the sign of $\\mu$.

It is unstable for $\\mu  0$ and stable for $\\mu  0$.\n\n3.  **Eigenvalue at the Bifurcation Point**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the eigenvalue at the specific equilibrium $x^{\\ast} = 0$ when the parameter is set to the bifurcation value $\\mu = 0$.\nUsing the result from the previous step for the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}_1 = 0$, the eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = \\mu$.\nSubstituting $\\mu = 0$ into this expression yields:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = 0\n$$\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Inconclusive Linearization Test**\n\nAt $\\mu=0$, the system simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -x^2\n$$\nThe only equilibrium is $x^{\\ast} = 0$. As calculated in part 3, the eigenvalue of the Jacobian at this equilibrium is $\\lambda = 0$. According to the problem's definition, if any eigenvalue has a zero real part, the linearization-based stability test is inconclusive. This is because the linear approximation of the system at this point is $\\frac{d(\\delta x)}{dt} = \\lambda \\delta x = 0 \\cdot \\delta x = 0$, which provides no information about the growth or decay of perturbations $\\delta x$. The stability is therefore determined by the higher-order, nonlinear terms in the Taylor expansion of $f(x)$ around $x^{\\ast}=0$.\n\nIn this case, the first non-vanishing term is the quadratic term, $-x^2$, which the problem refers to as the \"leading nonlinear term\". We can determine the directional (one-sided) behavior by inspecting the sign of $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ for values of $x$ near $x^{\\ast} = 0$.\n\n-   For any small positive value of $x$ (i.e., $x > 0$), the right-hand side is $\\frac{dx}{dt} = -x^2  0$. This negative rate of change implies that trajectories starting to the right of the equilibrium will move towards the equilibrium. Thus, the equilibrium is stable from the right side.\n-   For any small negative value of $x$ (i.e., $x  0$), the right-hand side is also $\\frac{dx}{dt} = -x^2  0$. This negative rate of change implies that trajectories starting to the left of the equilibrium will move further away from it (in the negative direction). Thus, the equilibrium is unstable from the left side.\n\nBecause the equilibrium is stable from one side and unstable from the other, it is termed **semistable**. The linearization test is inconclusive because it lacks the capacity to describe this mixed stability behavior; its verdict is limited to full local asymptotic stability or instability. The rigorous reason for this behavior lies in the sign of the leading nonlinear term $-x^2$, which is non-positive for all $x$, causing all trajectories to move to the left on the real number line.",
