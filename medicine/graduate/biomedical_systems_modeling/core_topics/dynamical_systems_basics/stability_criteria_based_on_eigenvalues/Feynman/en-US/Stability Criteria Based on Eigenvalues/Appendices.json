Near equilibrium, first-order mass-action kinetics and constant translation efficiency yield a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system for small deviations, written as $\\dot{x}=A x$, where $x=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ and\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}\n-1  0\\\\\n3  -2\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$\nwith all rate constants in $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the dominant decay rate, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$, for a given Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system modeling a two-stage gene expression module. The system is described by the matrix differential equation $\\dot{x}=A x$, with the matrix $A$ provided.\n\nFirst, the validity of the problem must be ascertained.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The system is an LTI model: $\\dot{x}=A x$.\n- The state vector $x=\\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}\\\\ x_{2}\\end{bmatrix}$ represents deviations from steady-state concentrations of mRNA ($x_{1}$) and protein ($x_{2}$).\n- The system matrix is $A=\\begin{bmatrix} -1  0\\\\ 3  -2 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n- The rate constants have units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n- The definition of the dominant decay rate, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$, is the positive scalar such that the slowest decaying mode behaves asymptotically as $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard approach in systems biology: modeling biochemical reaction networks near a steady state using a linearized system of ordinary differential equations. The matrix $A$ represents a simple cascade where a species (mRNA) is produced and degrades, and in turn produces a second species (protein) which also degrades. The matrix entries have a clear physical interpretation: the diagonal elements ($-1$, $-2$) are first-order decay rates, and the off-diagonal element ($3$) is a production rate. The use of eigenvalues to determine stability and modal dynamics is a fundamental concept in linear systems theory. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is fully specified. The matrix $A$ is given, and the quantity to be determined, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$, is unambiguously defined. The calculation of eigenvalues from a $2 \\times 2$ matrix is a standard, well-defined mathematical procedure leading to a unique set of eigenvalues.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical and scientific language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution involves three main steps as requested by the problem statement: deriving the eigenvalues, assessing stability, and determining the dominant decay rate.\n\n**Derivation of Eigenvalues**\nThe eigenvalues, denoted by $\\lambda$, of the matrix $A$ are the solutions to the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\nThe matrix $A - \\lambda I$ is:\n$$\nA - \\lambda I = \\begin{bmatrix} -1  0\\\\ 3  -2 \\end{bmatrix} - \\lambda \\begin{bmatrix} 1  0\\\\ 0  1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1-\\lambda  0\\\\ 3  -2-\\lambda \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this matrix gives the characteristic polynomial:\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (-1-\\lambda)(-2-\\lambda) - (3)(0)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(A - \\lambda I) = (1+\\lambda)(2+\\lambda) = \\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 2\n$$\nSetting the characteristic polynomial to zero yields the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 + 3\\lambda + 2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a simple quadratic equation which can be factored:\n$$\n(\\lambda + 1)(\\lambda + 2) = 0\n$$\nThe roots of this equation are the eigenvalues of $A$:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = -2\n$$\n\n**Stability Classification**\nThe stability of the equilibrium point (the origin, $x=0$) is determined by the sign of the real parts of the eigenvalues.\nThe eigenvalues are both real numbers.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -1  0\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -2  0\n$$\nSince all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts, the equilibrium point is asymptotically stable. This means that any small perturbation from the steady state will decay back to the steady state over time.\n\n**Inference of the Dominant Decay Rate, $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$**\nThe general solution of the system is a linear combination of the modal components, $x(t) = c_1 v_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) + c_2 v_2 \\exp(\\lambda_2 t)$, where $v_1, v_2$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$, and $c_1, c_2$ are constants determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe two temporal modes are $\\exp(\\lambda_1 t) = \\exp(-t)$ and $\\exp(\\lambda_2 t) = \\exp(-2t)$.\nThe decay rate of a mode $\\exp(\\lambda t)$ is given by $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda)$.\nFor the first mode, the decay rate is $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_1) = -(-1) = 1$.\nFor the second mode, the decay rate is $-\\mathrm{Re}(\\lambda_2) = -(-2) = 2$.\n\nThe \"slowest decaying mode\" is the one with the smallest decay rate. In this case, the smallest decay rate is $1$. This corresponds to the eigenvalue with the real part closest to zero, which is $\\lambda_1 = -1$. This is the dominant eigenvalue, as its corresponding mode, $\\exp(-t)$, will persist the longest as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe problem defines $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ as the positive scalar such that the slowest decaying mode behaves asymptotically like $\\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)$.\nThe slowest decaying mode is $\\exp(-t)$.\nBy direct comparison:\n$$\n\\exp(-t) = \\exp(-k_{\\mathrm{dom}} t)\n$$\nThis implies that $k_{\\mathrm{dom}} = 1$. The units of $k_{\\mathrm{dom}}$ are inherited from the eigenvalues, which are $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$.\n\nThe problem requires the value to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{dom}} = 1.00\n$$",

The fundamental solution is $\\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{A t} \\mathbf{x}(0)$, where $e^{A t}$ is the matrix exponential. Although asymptotic stability is determined by the locations of eigenvalues of $A$ in the complex plane, non-normality of $A$ (non-orthogonal eigenvectors) may produce transient amplification in the induced $2$-norm $\\|e^{A t}\\|_2$ even if all eigenvalues have strictly negative real parts. In biomedical systems modeling, such transient amplification corresponds to overshoot in measured signals (for example, concentrations or voltages) before eventual decay, under worst-case initial conditions aligned with the most amplifying directions of the dynamics.\n\nYour task is to implement a program that, for a given matrix $A$, samples time $t$ on a uniform grid and estimates the transient amplification by computing the maximum of the induced $2$-norm $\\|e^{A t}\\|_2$ over a specified time horizon.

It provides a complete and consistent set of givens, allowing for a unique numerical solution. The problem asks for the implementation of a numerical algorithm to quantify transient amplification in linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, a standard topic in the analysis of dynamical systems.\n\nThe problem investigates the dynamics of a biomedical system modeled by the state-space equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt} = A \\mathbf{x}(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ is the state vector representing concentrations of two biochemical species, and $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ is the state matrix encoding their first-order interaction rates. The solution to this linear ordinary differential equation is given by $\\mathbf{x}(t) = e^{A t} \\mathbf{x}(0)$, where $e^{At}$ is the matrix exponential, which acts as the solution operator propagating the initial state $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ forward in time.\n\nAsymptotic stability of the system is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$. If all eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ of $A$ have strictly negative real parts, i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)  0$, the system is asymptotically stable. This means that for any initial condition $\\mathbf{x}(0)$, the state will decay to zero as time approaches infinity, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\|\\mathbf{x}(t)\\|_2 = 0$. All test cases provided have matrices with eigenvalues possessing negative real parts, confirming their asymptotic stability.\n\nHowever, even in a stable system, the norm of the state vector can exhibit transient growth before its eventual decay. This phenomenon, known as transient amplification or overshoot, is particularly relevant in systems where the matrix $A$ is non-normal. A matrix $A$ is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose, $A A^H = A^H A$. For real matrices, this condition is $A A^T = A^T A$. Non-normal matrices can have non-orthogonal eigenvectors, which can lead to constructive interference of dynamic modes, causing substantial short-term growth in the system's response, even when all modes are individually decaying.\n\nThe magnitude of the system's response is quantified by the induced $2$-norm of the matrix exponential, $\\|e^{At}\\|_2$. This norm represents the maximum amplification factor that can be applied to any initial state vector $\\mathbf{x}(0)$ of unit norm, i.e., $\\|e^{At}\\|_2 = \\max_{\\|\\mathbf{x}(0)\\|_2=1} \\|e^{At}\\mathbf{x}(0)\\|_2$.

The time step is $\\Delta t = T_{\\max} / (N-1) = 5 / (5001-1) = 0.001$ seconds.\n\nFor each time point $t_k$ in the grid, we perform the following computations:\n- Compute the matrix product $A t_k$.\n- Calculate the matrix exponential $B_k = e^{A t_k}$. This is achieved using a robust numerical algorithm, such as the one implemented in `scipy.linalg.expm`.\n- Evaluate the induced $2$-norm $\\|B_k\\|_2$. This is equivalent to finding the largest singular value of $B_k$, which can be computed efficiently using standard linear algebra libraries, for instance, via `numpy.linalg.norm(B_k, ord=2)`.\n\nAfter computing the norm for all time points in the grid, we identify the maximum value among them, which gives our estimate for $G_{\\max}$. The time $t_k$ corresponding to the first occurrence of this maximum value is taken as $t^\\star$. Finally, the overshoot condition is checked by comparing $G_{\\max}$ to $1 + 10^{-9}$.
