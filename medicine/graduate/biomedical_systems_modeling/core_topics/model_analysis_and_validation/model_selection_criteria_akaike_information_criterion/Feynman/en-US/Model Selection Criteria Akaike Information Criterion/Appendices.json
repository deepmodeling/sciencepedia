Each candidate is a Nonlinear Mixed-Effects (NLME) model estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML). The first model includes fixed effects and random effects for clearance and volume with $k=14$ freely estimated parameters. The second model includes an additional random-effect covariance term and a nonlinear covariate effect on clearance, resulting in $k=16$ freely estimated parameters.

No physical units are required for the final quantity.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) from first principles related to Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence and its subsequent application to a model selection problem in pharmacokinetic modeling.\n\nFirst, the theoretical derivation of AIC is performed. The foundation of AIC is information theory. Let the true, unknown data-generating process be represented by a probability density function (pdf) $f(x)$. We aim to approximate this process with a parametric model from a family of pdfs denoted by $g(x|\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is a vector of parameters. The Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, quantifies the information lost when the model $g(x|\\theta)$ is used to approximate the true process $f(x)$. It is defined as the expectation, with respect to the true distribution $f$, of the logarithm of the ratio of the two densities:\n$$ D_{KL}(f || g(\\cdot|\\theta)) = E_f\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x|\\theta)}\\right)\\right] = \\int f(x) \\ln(f(x)) dx - \\int f(x) \\ln(g(x|\\theta)) dx $$\nIn this expression, the term $\\int f(x) \\ln(f(x)) dx$ is the entropy of the true distribution. Since this term is constant for a given true process $f(x)$ and does not depend on the model $g(x|\\theta)$, minimizing the KL divergence is equivalent to maximizing the second term, $E_f[\\ln(g(x|\\theta))]$. This term represents the expected log-likelihood of the model under the true data-generating distribution.\n\nIn practice, the true distribution $f(x)$ and the true parameters $\\theta_0$ that an idealized model would have are unknown. We have a set of observed data, say $y$, which is a realization from the distribution $f(x)$. Using this data, we obtain an estimate of the parameters, $\\hat{\\theta}$, typically via the method of Maximum Likelihood (ML). The ML estimate, $\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}$, is the value of $\\theta$ that maximizes the log-likelihood function for the observed data, $\\ell(\\theta|y) = \\ln g(y|\\theta)$.\n\nThe maximized log-likelihood, $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}|y)$, measures the goodness of fit of the model to the data used for fitting. However, it is an optimistically biased estimator of the model's predictive accuracy on a new, independent dataset, $y_{new}$, also drawn from $f(x)$. The quantity we truly wish to maximize for model selection is the expected predictive log-likelihood, which can be expressed as an expectation over the distribution of the original data $y$: $E_y \\left[ E_{y_{new}}[\\ln g(y_{new}|\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}(y))] \\right]$.\n\nAkaike demonstrated that, under certain regularity conditions and for a large sample size, the in-sample maximized log-likelihood overestimates this target quantity. He established an asymptotic relationship between the two:\n$$ E_y \\left[ \\ell(\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}(y)|y) \\right] - E_y \\left[ E_{y_{new}}[\\ln g(y_{new}|\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}(y))] \\right] \\approx k $$\nwhere $k$ is the number of freely estimated parameters in the vector $\\theta$. This implies that the maximized log-likelihood $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}|y)$ is, on average, biased upwards as an estimate of the expected predictive log-likelihood by an amount approximately equal to $k$.\n\nTo obtain a less biased estimate of the predictive accuracy, we can correct for this optimism by subtracting the bias term $k$ from the maximized log-likelihood. An approximately unbiased estimator of the expected predictive log-likelihood is therefore $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}_{ML}|y) - k$. Maximizing this quantity is a sound principle for model selection.\n\nFor historical reasons related to deviance and likelihood-ratio tests, Akaike defined his criterion by multiplying this bias-corrected log-likelihood by $-2$. This transforms the goal from maximization to minimization. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is thus defined as:\n$$ AIC = -2 (\\ell - k) = -2\\ell + 2k $$\nwhere $\\ell$ is the maximized value of the log-likelihood for the model and $k$ is the number of freely estimated parameters. The model with the lowest AIC value is selected as the one that best balances goodness of fit (high $\\ell$) with parsimony (low $k$).\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two candidate models described in the problem.\n\nFor Model 1:\nNumber of parameters, $k_1 = 14$.\nMaximized log-likelihood, $\\ell_1 = -1020.5$.\nThe AIC for Model 1 is:\n$$ AIC_1 = -2\\ell_1 + 2k_1 = -2(-1020.5) + 2(14) $$\n$$ AIC_1 = 2041.0 + 28 = 2069.0 $$\n\nFor Model 2:\nNumber of parameters, $k_2 = 16$.\nMaximized log-likelihood, $\\ell_2 = -1018.0$.\nThe AIC for Model 2 is:\n$$ AIC_2 = -2\\ell_2 + 2k_2 = -2(-1018.0) + 2(16) $$\n$$ AIC_2 = 2036.0 + 32 = 2068.0 $$\n\nTo select the preferred model, we compare their AIC values. The model with the lower AIC is considered superior.\n$AIC_1 = 2069.0$\n$AIC_2 = 2068.0$\nSince $AIC_2  AIC_1$, Model 2 is the preferred model. The improvement in fit (increase in log-likelihood by $2.5$) is sufficient to justify the addition of $2$ extra parameters according to the AIC.\n\nThe final step is to compute the difference in AIC between the worse (non-preferred) model and the better (preferred) model.\nWorse model: Model 1 ($AIC_1 = 2069.0$)\nBetter model: Model 2 ($AIC_2 = 2068.0$)\nThe difference, $\\Delta AIC$, is:\n$$ \\Delta AIC = AIC_{worse} - AIC_{better} = AIC_1 - AIC_2 $$\n$$ \\Delta AIC = 2069.0 - 2068.0 = 1.0 $$\nThe problem requires this result to be reported to four significant figures. The value $1.0$ must be written as $1.000$ to meet this precision requirement.\n$$ \\Delta AIC = 1.000 $$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in statistical information theory, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and free from any factual or logical inconsistencies.\n\nThe Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and its small-sample corrected version (AICc) are criteria for model selection based on information theory. They provide an estimate of the expected, relative information loss when a given model is used to represent the process that generates the data. The derivation begins with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.\n\nLet the true, unknown data-generating process have a probability distribution function (or density) denoted by $f(x)$. Let our candidate model be represented by a family of distributions $g(x|\\theta)$, parameterized by a vector $\\theta$. The KL divergence, or information loss, from using $g$ to approximate $f$ is defined as:\n$$\nI(f,g) = \\int f(x) \\ln\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{g(x|\\theta)}\\right) dx\n$$\nThis expression can be expanded as:\n$$\nI(f,g) = \\int f(x) \\ln(f(x)) dx - \\int f(x) \\ln(g(x|\\theta)) dx\n$$\nThe first term, $\\int f(x) \\ln(f(x)) dx$, depends only on the true distribution $f$ and is a constant with respect to the model $g$. Therefore, minimizing the KL divergence $I(f,g)$ is equivalent to maximizing the second term, which is the expected log-likelihood of the model $g(x|\\theta)$, where the expectation is taken with respect to the true distribution $f$:\n$$\nE_{x \\sim f}[\\ln(g(x|\\theta))] = \\int f(x) \\ln(g(x|\\theta)) dx\n$$\nIn practice, we do not know the true parameter vector $\\theta$ for our model family. We estimate it from the data, typically using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), denoted as $\\hat{\\theta}$. The quality of the model with the estimated parameters, $g(x|\\hat{\\theta})$, is then evaluated by its expected performance on new data, $y$, drawn from the same true distribution $f$. This is the expected information loss:\n$$\nE_{y \\sim f} \\left[ E_{x \\sim f}[\\ln(g(y|\\hat{\\theta}(x)))] \\right]\n$$\nwhere the double expectation signifies that we are averaging over both the training data $x$ (which determines $\\hat{\\theta}$) and the new, independent validation data $y$.\n\nAkaike showed that the maximized log-likelihood from the training data, $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) = \\ln(\\mathcal{L}(\\hat{\\theta}|x))$, where $\\mathcal{L}$ is the likelihood function, is a biased estimator of this target quantity. For large sample sizes $n$, the asymptotic bias is approximately the number of estimable parameters, $k$, in the model. That is:\n$$\nE[\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})] \\approx E_{y \\sim f} \\left[ E_{x \\sim f}[\\ln(g(y|\\hat{\\theta}(x)))] \\right] + k\n$$\nThus, a bias-corrected estimate of the expected log-likelihood for predictive purposes is $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) - k$. Akaike defined his criterion by multiplying this quantity by $-2$ for historical reasons related to deviance statistics:\n$$\nAIC = -2 (\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) - k) = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k\n$$\nThis is the Akaike Information Criterion. A lower AIC value indicates a model with a better expected trade-off between goodness of fit (high $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta})$) and complexity (low $k$).\n\nThe bias correction term $k$ is an asymptotic result. For smaller sample sizes, where the ratio $n/k$ is not large (typically, when $n/k  40$), this correction is insufficient. A second-order correction term, which accounts for the sample size, provides a more accurate estimate of the information loss. This leads to the small-sample corrected Akaike Information Criterion, or AICc. The more accurate bias correction is not $k$, but rather $k \\frac{n}{n-k-1}$. The AICc is defined as:\n$$\nAICc = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k \\frac{n}{n-k-1}\n$$\nThe relationship between AICc and AIC can be expressed by isolating the additional penalty term:\n$$\nAICc = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k + 2k\\left(\\frac{n}{n-k-1} - 1\\right)\n$$\n$$\nAICc = AIC + 2k\\left(\\frac{n - (n-k-1)}{n-k-1}\\right) = AIC + 2k\\left(\\frac{k+1}{n-k-1}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nAICc = AIC + \\frac{2k(k+1)}{n-k-1}\n$$\nThis form explicitly shows the small-sample correction penalty, which depends on both the number of parameters $k$ and the sample size $n$. As $n \\to \\infty$, the correction term vanishes, and $AICc \\to AIC$.\n\nNow we compute the values for the given problem. The provided values are:\n- Sample size, $n = 30$\n- Number of free parameters, $k = 8$\n- Maximized log-likelihood, $\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) = -120$\n\nFirst, we compute the AIC:\n$$\nAIC = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k = -2(-120) + 2(8) = 240 + 16 = 256\n$$\nNext, we compute the AICc:\n$$\nAICc = -2\\ell(\\hat{\\theta}) + 2k \\frac{n}{n-k-1} = -2(-120) + 2(8) \\frac{30}{30-8-1}\n$$\n$$\nAICc = 240 + 16 \\left(\\frac{30}{21}\\right) = 240 + 16 \\left(\\frac{10}{7}\\right) = 240 + \\frac{160}{7}\n$$\nTo express this as a single fraction:\n$$\nAICc = \\frac{240 \\times 7}{7} + \\frac{160}{7} = \\frac{1680 + 160}{7} = \\frac{1840}{7}\n$$\nThe problem asks for an interpretation of the small-sample correction. The ratio $n/k = 30/8 = 3.75$. Since this ratio is significantly less than the common rule-of-thumb threshold of $40$, the use of AICc is strongly recommended over AIC.\n\nThe magnitude of the small-sample correction is the difference between AICc and AIC:\n$$\n\\text{Absolute correction} = AICc - AIC = \\frac{1840}{7} - 256 = \\frac{1840 - 256 \\times 7}{7} = \\frac{1840 - 1792}{7} = \\frac{48}{7}\n$$\nThis absolute difference of $\\frac{48}{7} \\approx 6.86$ is substantial. Model selection decisions are often based on differences in AIC values (e.g., a difference greater than $2$ is considered meaningful), so this correction is large enough to potentially alter conclusions about which model is best.\n\nThe relative correction with respect to AIC is:\n$$\n\\text{Relative correction} = \\frac{AICc - AIC}{AIC} = \\frac{48/7}{256} = \\frac{48}{7 \\times 256} = \\frac{3 \\times 16}{7 \\times 16 \\times 16} = \\frac{3}{7 \\times 16} = \\frac{3}{112}\n$$\nThis corresponds to a relative increase of $\\frac{3}{112} \\approx 2.68\\%$. The AICc value is higher than the AIC value, reflecting a greater penalty for model complexity. This increased penalty helps guard against overfitting, a phenomenon where a model fits the noise in the specific dataset too closely and consequently has poor predictive performance on new data. In settings with a low $n/k$ ratio, this risk is particularly high, making the AICc correction essential for robust model selection.\nThe final required outputs are the numerical values for $AIC$ and $AICc$.\n\n$AIC = 256$\n$AICc = \\frac{1840}{7}$",

Derivation and Computation of Relative Model Support**\n\nThe problem requires deriving a measure of model support from the first principles of likelihood-based information. AIC originates from Kullback-Leibler (KL) information theory. The central idea is that the likelihood of a model $M_i$, given the data $D$, is proportional to the exponential of its negative estimated KL information loss relative to the true data-generating process. Akaike showed that an unbiased estimator of this relative expected information is $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{AIC}_i$.\n\nTherefore, the likelihood of a model $M_i$ given the data, $\\mathcal{L}(M_i|D)$, can be related to its AIC value through the transformation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(M_i|D) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{AIC}_i\\right)\n$$\nThis transformation places the models on a likelihood scale, allowing for direct comparison. The relative support of one model ($M_i$) versus another ($M_j$) is quantified by the evidence ratio, which is the ratio of their likelihoods:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{L}(M_i|D)}{\\mathcal{L}(M_j|D)} = \\frac{\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{AIC}_i)}{\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{AIC}_j)} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AIC}_i - \\mathrm{AIC}_j)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta_{ij}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta_{ij} = \\mathrm{AIC}_i - \\mathrm{AIC}_j$. This evidence ratio is the coherent measure of model support requested.\n\nUsing this derived relationship, we compute the pairwise support comparisons, using the best model $M_1$ as the reference where appropriate:\n-   **Model $M_1$ vs. Model $M_2$**: The evidence ratio of $M_1$ over $M_2$ is\n    $$\n    E_{1,2} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AIC}_1 - \\mathrm{AIC}_2)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(134.2 - 135.0)\\right) = \\exp(0.4) \\approx 1.492\n    $$\n-   **Model $M_1$ vs. Model $M_3$**: The evidence ratio of $M_1$ over $M_3$ is\n    $$\n    E_{1,3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AIC}_1 - \\mathrm{AIC}_3)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(134.2 - 141.3)\\right) = \\exp(3.55) \\approx 34.813\n    $$\n-   **Model $M_2$ vs. Model $M_3$**: The evidence ratio of $M_2$ over $M_3$ is\n    $$\n    E_{2,3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AIC}_2 - \\mathrm{AIC}_3)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(135.0 - 141.3)\\right) = \\exp(3.15) \\approx 23.336\n    $$\n\n**3. Interpretation of Practical Support Levels**\n\nThe interpretation of the quantitative results relies on established heuristics for $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}$ values (e.g., as presented by Burnham and Anderson, 2002).\n-   $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} \\in [0, 2]$: The model has substantial support and is essentially indistinguishable from the best model.\n-   $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC} \\in [4, 7]$: The model has considerably less support.\n-   $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}  10$: The model has essentially no support and can be dismissed.\n\nApplying these heuristics to the current biomedical modeling context:\n-   **Model $M_1$ (single-compartment)** has a $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}_1 = 0$ and is the most supported model in the set by definition.\n-   **Model $M_2$ (two-compartment)**, with $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}_2 = 0.8$, falls squarely in the range of substantial support. The evidence ratio of $\\approx 1.5$ indicates that $M_1$ is only slightly more plausible than $M_2$. In a practical setting, these two models would be considered **essentially indistinguishable**. The data do not provide a strong basis for rejecting the slightly more complex two-compartment structure of $M_2$ in favor of the parsimonious single-compartment model $M_1$.\n-   **Model $M_3$ (nonlinear)**, with $\\Delta \\mathrm{AIC}_3 = 7.1$, is on the upper boundary of the \"considerably less supported\" category. The evidence ratio of $\\approx 35$ indicates that the best model, $M_1$, is nearly $35$ times more supported by the data than $M_3$. This represents a strong evidence differential. In this biomedical context, Model $M_3$ would be considered **considerably less supported** and a poor candidate for explaining the observed glucose-insulin dynamics, and should likely be discarded from further consideration.\n\nThe final answer required is the evidence ratio of the most supported model ($M_1$) relative to the least supported model ($M_3$). This was calculated in Part 2 as $E_{1,3}$.\n$$\nE_{1,3} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathrm{AIC}_1 - \\mathrm{AIC}_3)\\right) = \\exp(3.55) \\approx 34.813395\n$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $34.81$.",
