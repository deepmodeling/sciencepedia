This exercise  challenges you to derive the Fisher information for the rate parameter $\\lambda$, a quantity central to modeling phenomena like photon counts from a biosensor or occurrences of genetic mutations. By working through this derivation from first principles, you will develop a concrete intuition for how information is quantified and see how an experiment's sensitivity to parameter changes depends on the underlying event rate.",

            "problem": "A single-molecule fluorescence biosensor counts photon emission events in fixed acquisition intervals. Under standard conditions, the photon counts in each interval are modeled as independent and identically distributed draws $y_{i} \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$, where $\\lambda$ is the mean event rate per interval determined by molecular concentration and instrument gain. Suppose $n$ consecutive intervals are recorded, yielding counts $\\{y_{1}, y_{2}, \\dots, y_{n}\\}$.\n\nStarting from the modeling assumptions and first principles of likelihood-based inference, derive the scalar Fisher information (the $(1,1)$ element of the Fisher information matrix for this single-parameter model) about the parameter $\\lambda$ contained in the $n$ observations. Then, based on your derived expression, discuss how the local sensitivity to changes in $\\lambda$ differs between low-count and high-count regimes in this biosensing context.\n\nExpress your final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$ and $\\lambda$. No rounding is required, and no physical units should be included in the final expression.",
            "solution": "The goal is to derive the scalar Fisher information for the parameter $\\lambda$ of a Poisson process, given $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) observations $\\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\}$, where each $y_i \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe Fisher information, $I(\\lambda)$, for a single parameter $\\lambda$ can be calculated as the negative of the expected value of the second derivative of the log-likelihood function with respect to the parameter:\n$$\nI(\\lambda) = -E\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial \\lambda^2} \\ln L(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y}) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $L(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y})$ is the likelihood function for the set of observations $\\mathbf{y} = \\{y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish the log-likelihood function. Since the $n$ observations are i.i.d. from a Poisson distribution, the total likelihood function $L(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y})$ is the product of the individual probability mass functions (PMFs):\n$$\nL(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} P(y_i | \\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{y_i!}\n$$\nThe log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y}) = \\ln L(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y})$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\ell(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln \\left( \\frac{\\lambda^{y_i} e^{-\\lambda}}{y_i!} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( y_i \\ln(\\lambda) - \\lambda - \\ln(y_i!) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell(\\lambda | \\mathbf{y}) = \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\right) \\ln(\\lambda) - n\\lambda - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(y_i!)\n$$\nNext, we find the first and second derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to $\\lambda$:\nThe first derivative (the score function) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial \\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i - n\n$$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial \\lambda^2} = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\n$$\nFinally, we compute the Fisher information by taking the negative of the expectation of this second derivative. The expectation is taken over the distribution of the data $\\mathbf{y}$.\n$$\nI(\\lambda) = -E\\left[ -\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} E\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\right]\n$$\nBy linearity of expectation, and since $E[y_i] = \\lambda$ for a Poisson random variable:\n$$\nE\\left[ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i \\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[y_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda = n\\lambda\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $I(\\lambda)$:\n$$\nI(\\lambda) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} (n\\lambda) = \\frac{n}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the scalar Fisher information for the parameter $\\lambda$ based on $n$ i.i.d. Poisson observations.\n\nNow, we discuss how the local sensitivity to changes in $\\lambda$ differs between low-count and high-count regimes.\nThe Fisher information, $I(\\lambda) = n/\\lambda$, quantifies the amount of information the data provide about the parameter $\\lambda$. A higher value of $I(\\lambda)$ implies that the log-likelihood function is more sharply peaked, allowing for a more precise estimation of $\\lambda$. The Cramér-Rao lower bound states that the variance of any unbiased estimator $\\hat{\\lambda}$ is bounded by $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\lambda}) \\ge 1/I(\\lambda) = \\lambda/n$.\n\nIn the **low-count regime** (where $\\lambda$ is small, approaching $0$):\nThe Fisher information $I(\\lambda) = n/\\lambda$ becomes very large. This indicates a high degree of local sensitivity to absolute changes in $\\lambda$. For example, distinguishing between a mean count rate of $\\lambda=0.1$ and $\\lambda=0.2$ is relatively easy because the probability of observing zero photons, $P(y=0) = e^{-\\lambda}$, changes significantly. The log-likelihood function is highly curved near small values of $\\lambda$, meaning that the parameter is well-localized by the data.\n\nIn the **high-count regime** (where $\\lambda$ is large):\nThe Fisher information $I(\\lambda) = n/\\lambda$ becomes small. This indicates that the experiment is less sensitive to small *absolute* changes in $\\lambda$. For instance, distinguishing between $\\lambda=100$ and $\\lambda=101$ is much more difficult than distinguishing between $\\lambda=1$ and $\\lambda=2$, even though the absolute difference is $1$ in both cases. The log-likelihood function is broader, implying that the parameter is less precisely localized for a given absolute change. While the absolute precision (proportional to $1/\\sqrt{I(\\lambda)} = \\sqrt{\\lambda/n}$) worsens as $\\lambda$ increases, the *relative* precision (proportional to $\\sqrt{\\lambda/n} / \\lambda = 1/\\sqrt{n\\lambda}$) improves. However, Fisher information itself relates to the curvature of the log-likelihood with respect to the parameter $\\lambda$, and this curvature decreases as $\\lambda$ increases, signifying lower local sensitivity to absolute parameter changes.",
