It is not scientifically unsound, non-formalizable, incomplete, unrealistic, ill-posed, trivial, or unverifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires us to apply the principles of statistical mechanics to a simple model of gene regulation. The probability of the system being in a particular microstate $i$ is given by the ratio of its statistical weight $w_i$ to the partition function $Z$, which is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates.\n$$P_i = \\frac{w_i}{Z}$$\n\nFirst, we consider the system in the presence of the repressor. The possible microstates are empty, RNAP-bound, and repressor-bound. The statistical weights are given as $1$, $p$, and $r$, respectively. The partition function, $Z_{with\\_R}$, is the sum of these weights:\n$$Z_{with\\_R} = 1 + p + r$$\nThe probability that RNAP is bound to the promoter, which we denote as $P(RNAP | with\\_R)$, is the weight of the RNAP-bound state divided by this partition function:\n$$P(RNAP | with\\_R) = \\frac{p}{1 + p + r}$$\n\nNext, we consider the system in the absence of the repressor. The absence of the repressor corresponds to its concentration being zero, $[R]=0$. This implies that the dimensionless parameter $r \\equiv [R]/K_R$ is also zero: $r=0$. In this case, the repressor-bound state is not accessible. The possible microstates are only empty and RNAP-bound. The partition function, $Z_{without\\_R}$, is:\n$$Z_{without\\_R} = 1 + p$$\nAlternatively, one can obtain this by setting $r=0$ in the general partition function $Z_{with\\_R}$. The probability that RNAP is bound in the absence of the repressor, $P(RNAP | without\\_R)$, is then:\n$$P(RNAP | without\\_R) = \\frac{p}{1 + p}$$\n\nNow, we can compute the fold-change, $f$, using its definition as the ratio of these two probabilities:\n$$f = \\frac{P(RNAP | with\\_R)}{P(RNAP | without\\_R)} = \\frac{\\frac{p}{1 + p + r}}{\\frac{p}{1 + p}}$$\nSimplifying this expression by canceling the common factor $p$ and inverting the denominator gives:\n$$f = \\frac{1 + p}{1 + p + r}$$\nThis is the expression for the fold-change as a function of $p$ and $r$.\n\nThe final step is to enforce the half-maximal repression condition, which is stated as $f = 0.5$, or $f = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set our derived expression for $f$ equal to this value and solve for $r$.\n$$\\frac{1 + p}{1 + p + r} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTo solve for $r$, we can cross-multiply:\n$$2(1 + p) = 1(1 + p + r)$$\n$$2 + 2p = 1 + p + r$$\nNow, we isolate $r$ by subtracting $(1+p)$ from both sides of the equation:\n$$r = (2 + 2p) - (1 + p)$$\n$$r = 2 - 1 + 2p - p$$\n$$r = 1 + p$$\nThus, for the fold-change to be exactly $0.5$, the dimensionless concentration of the repressor, $r$, must be equal to $1 + p$.",

Each specific binding event contributes a factor equal to a dimensionless activity that combines the regulator abundance and its equilibrium association with the site.\n\nFor simple repression (occlusion), model the promoter states as: empty, RNAP-bound, and repressor-bound, where the repressor excludes RNAP from binding.

Let $p$ denote the dimensionless weight for RNAP binding at the promoter, $r$ denote the dimensionless weight for repressor binding at the operator, and $a$ denote the dimensionless weight for activator binding at its site. Treat $f$ as a fixed, dimensionless cooperativity parameter arising from an interaction energy between RNAP and the activator in the joint complex.\n\nDefine the fold-change in expression, $\\mathrm{fc}$, as the ratio of the RNAP-bound probability in the regulated promoter to that in the corresponding unregulated promoter (no regulator present, i.e., $r=0$ for repression or $a=0$ for activation), holding $p$ fixed.

Second, we must formulate the likelihood function for the model parameters given experimental data. Third, we must derive the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) for the unknown parameters.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Theoretical Fold-Change\n\nThe system consists of a single specific binding site for a repressor (the operator) and $N_{\\mathrm{NS}}$ nonspecific binding sites on the DNA. There are $R$ repressor molecules in the cell. The binding energy of a repressor to the specific site, relative to a nonspecific site, is $\\epsilon_{R}$. The system is at thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature $T_j$, corresponding to an inverse temperature parameter $\\beta_j = 1/(k_B T_j)$.\n\nThe fold-change, $f_j$, is the ratio of the mean gene expression in the presence of the repressor to the mean expression in its absence. Gene expression is assumed to be proportional to the probability that the promoter (and its associated operator site) is not occupied by a repressor, thus allowing RNA polymerase to bind and initiate transcription. In the absence of the repressor, the promoter is always free, so the expression is at its maximum. Therefore, the fold-change is equal to the probability that the operator site is unoccupied, $p_{\\text{free}}$.\n\n$$f_j = p_{\\text{free}}$$\n\nTo find $p_{\\text{free}}$, we use the principles of statistical mechanics. We consider the statistical weights of the two possible states of the operator: bound by a repressor or free. The probability of the site being in a particular state is proportional to the Boltzmann weight of that state.\n\nLet's determine the ratio of the probability of the operator being bound, $p_{\\text{bound}}$, to the probability of it being free, $p_{\\text{free}}$.\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}}{p_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{W_{\\text{bound}}}{W_{\\text{free}}} $$\nwhere $W_{\\text{bound}}$ and $W_{\\text{free}}$ are the statistical weights of the bound and free states of the operator, respectively.\n\nWe can set the weight of the free state as our reference: $W_{\\text{free}} = 1$.\n\nThe weight of the bound state, $W_{\\text{bound}}$, is the product of the number of repressors available to bind and the Boltzmann factor associated with the binding energy. A standard simplification in this model is to assume that all $R$ repressors are distributed somewhere on the DNA, either at the single specific site or among the $N_{\\mathrm{NS}}$ nonspecific sites. The effective concentration of repressors available to bind to the specific site is determined by the number of repressors per nonspecific site, which is $\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}$. The Boltzmann factor for a repressor moving from a nonspecific site to the specific site is $\\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})$, since $\\epsilon_{R}$ is the energy difference.\n\nThus, the statistical weight of the bound state is:\n$$ W_{\\text{bound}} = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nThe ratio of probabilities is then:\n$$ \\frac{p_{\\text{bound}}}{p_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nSince $p_{\\text{bound}} + p_{\\text{free}} = 1$, we can write $p_{\\text{bound}} = 1 - p_{\\text{free}}$.

Let's calculate this theoretical quantity from our derived expression for $f_j$.\n$$ \\frac{1 - f_j}{f_j} = \\frac{1}{f_j} - 1 = \\left(1 + \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})\\right) - 1 = \\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R}) $$\n\nThe mean of $y_j$ is thus:\n$$ \\mu_j = E[y_j] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-f_j}{f_j}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}} \\exp(-\\beta_j \\epsilon_{R})\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) - \\beta_j \\epsilon_{R} $$\n\nThe model for the observed data points $y_j$ is:\n$$ y_j \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_j, s^2) \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\mu_j = \\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) - \\epsilon_{R}\\beta_j $$\nEach $y_j$ is drawn independently.

This is equivalent to maximizing the log-likelihood function, $\\ell = \\ln L$:\n$$ \\ell(\\epsilon_R, R) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\ln(2\\pi s^2) - \\frac{1}{2s^2} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_j}{x_j}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) + \\beta_j \\epsilon_R \\right)^2 $$\n\nMaximizing $\\ell$ is equivalent to minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(\\epsilon_R, R)$:\n$$ S(\\epsilon_R, R) = \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - x_j}{x_j}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{N_{\\mathrm{NS}}}\\right) + \\beta_j \\epsilon_R \\right)^2 $$\n\nLet us define $y_j = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)$. The model for the mean of $y_j$ is linear in $\\beta_j$:\n$$ y_j = (\\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})) - \\epsilon_R \\beta_j + \\text{error}_j $$\nThis is a standard linear regression problem of the form $y_j = \\theta_0 + \\theta_1 \\beta_j$, with parameters:\n$$ \\theta_0 = \\ln(R) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) $$\n$$ \\theta_1 = -\\epsilon_R $$\n\nThe least squares estimates for $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ minimize $S = \\sum_{j=1}^n (y_j - \\theta_0 - \\theta_1 \\beta_j)^2$. The solution is given by the normal equations of linear regression. Let $\\hat{\\theta}_0$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_1$ be the estimators.\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_1 = \\frac{n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j - (\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\bar{y} - \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\bar{\\beta} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j - \\hat{\\theta}_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right) $$\nA more direct expression for $\\hat{\\theta}_0$ from the matrix solution of the normal equations is:\n$$ \\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2) - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\n\nNow, we solve for the estimators $\\hat{\\epsilon}_R$ and $\\hat{R}$.\nFrom $\\hat{\\theta}_1 = -\\hat{\\epsilon}_R$, we get the estimator for $\\epsilon_R$:\n$$ \\hat{\\epsilon}_R = -\\hat{\\theta}_1 = -\\frac{n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j - (\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} = \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j) - n \\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} $$\nSubstituting back $y_j = \\ln(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j})$:\n$$ \\hat{\\epsilon}_R = \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k\\right) - n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)^2} $$\n\nFrom $\\hat{\\theta}_0 = \\ln(\\hat{R}) - \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})$, we get the estimator for $R$:\n$$ \\ln(\\hat{R}) = \\hat{\\theta}_0 + \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}}) $$\n$$ \\hat{R} = \\exp(\\hat{\\theta}_0 + \\ln(N_{\\mathrm{NS}})) = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp(\\hat{\\theta}_0) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{\\theta}_0$:\n$$ \\hat{R} = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp\\left( \\frac{(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2) - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)(\\sum_{j=1}^n y_j \\beta_j)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - (\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j)^2} \\right) $$\nSubstituting back $y_j = \\ln(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j})$:\n$$ \\hat{R} = N_{\\mathrm{NS}} \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_j}{x_j}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k^2\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\beta_k \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-x_k}{x_k}\\right)\\right)}{n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j^2 - \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^n \\beta_j\\right)^2} \\right) $$\nThese are the final closed-form expressions for the maximum likelihood estimators. As required, they do not depend on the noise variance $s^2$. The expression for $\\epsilon_R$ carries units of energy (Joules if $\\beta_j$ is in $J^{-1}$) and $R$ is a dimensionless count.",
