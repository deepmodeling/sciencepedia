            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of equilibrium statistical mechanics and biophysical chemistry, specifically the Adair-Klotz model for cooperative ligand binding. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and a consistent mathematical framework ($Q(L)$) to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.\n\nThe first task is to derive the fractional occupancy $\\theta(L)$ from first principles. The binding polynomial, or partition function, $Q(L)$, sums the statistical weights of all possible binding microstates. The provided polynomial is:\n$$Q(L) = 1 + 2\\frac{L}{K_{d}} + c\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{d}}\\right)^{2}$$\nHere, the term $1$ is the weight of the unoccupied receptor ($R$), the term $2\\frac{L}{K_{d}}$ is the weight of the two possible singly-occupied states ($RL$), and the term $c\\left(\\frac{L}{K_{d}}\\right)^{2}$ is the weight of the doubly-occupied state ($RL_2$).\n\nThe average number of ligands bound per receptor, $\\langle\\nu\\rangle$, can be derived from the binding polynomial using the fundamental relationship from statistical mechanics:\n$$\\langle\\nu\\rangle = L \\frac{d}{dL} \\ln(Q(L)) = \\frac{L}{Q(L)} \\frac{dQ(L)}{dL}$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $Q(L)$ with respect to the ligand concentration $L$:\n$$\\frac{dQ(L)}{dL} = \\frac{d}{dL} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2L}{K_d} + \\frac{cL^2}{K_d^2} \\right) = \\frac{2}{K_d} + \\frac{2cL}{K_d^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\langle\\nu\\rangle$:\n$$\\langle\\nu\\rangle = \\frac{L}{1 + 2\\frac{L}{K_d} + c\\frac{L^2}{K_d^2}} \\left( \\frac{2}{K_d} + \\frac{2cL}{K_d^2} \\right) = \\frac{2\\frac{L}{K_d} + 2c\\frac{L^2}{K_d^2}}{1 + 2\\frac{L}{K_d} + c\\frac{L^2}{K_d^2}}$$\nThe fractional occupancy, $\\theta(L)$, is the average number of bound ligands $\\langle\\nu\\rangle$ divided by the total number of binding sites, which is $N=2$ for this dimeric receptor.\n$$\\theta(L) = \\frac{\\langle\\nu\\rangle}{N} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2\\frac{L}{K_d} + 2c\\frac{L^2}{K_d^2}}{1 + 2\\frac{L}{K_d} + c\\frac{L^2}{K_d^2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\frac{L}{K_d} + c\\left(\\frac{L}{K_d}\\right)^2}{1 + 2\\frac{L}{K_d} + c\\left(\\frac{L}{K_d}\\right)^2}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate the Hill coefficient, $n_H$, at half-saturation ($\\theta=0.5$). The Hill coefficient is defined as:\n$$n_H = \\frac{d \\ln(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta})}{d \\ln L}$$\nLet us define a normalized ligand concentration $x = L/K_d$. Then $d \\ln L = d \\ln(xK_d) = d \\ln x$. The expression for $n_H$ becomes:\n$$n_H = \\frac{d \\ln(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta})}{d \\ln x}$$\nFirst, we express the ratio $\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}$ in terms of $x$.\n$$\\theta(x) = \\frac{x + cx^2}{1 + 2x + cx^2}$$\n$$1 - \\theta(x) = 1 - \\frac{x + cx^2}{1 + 2x + cx^2} = \\frac{(1 + 2x + cx^2) - (x + cx^2)}{1 + 2x + cx^2} = \\frac{1+x}{1 + 2x + cx^2}$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta} = \\frac{x+cx^2}{1+x} = \\frac{x(1+cx)}{1+x}$$\nNow, we take the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{1-\\theta}\\right) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(1+cx) - \\ln(1+x)$$\nWe can now differentiate with respect to $\\ln x$:\n$$n_H(x) = \\frac{d}{d \\ln x} \\left[ \\ln(x) + \\ln(1+cx) - \\ln(1+x) \\right]$$\nUsing the chain rule $\\frac{d f(x)}{d \\ln x} = x \\frac{d f(x)}{dx}$, we evaluate each term:\n$$n_H(x) = \\frac{d \\ln x}{d \\ln x} + \\frac{d \\ln(1+cx)}{d \\ln x} - \\frac{d \\ln(1+x)}{d \\ln x}$$\n$$n_H(x) = 1 + x \\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(1+cx) - x \\frac{d}{dx}\\ln(1+x)$$\n$$n_H(x) = 1 + x \\left(\\frac{c}{1+cx}\\right) - x \\left(\\frac{1}{1+x}\\right) = 1 + \\frac{cx}{1+cx} - \\frac{x}{1+x}$$\nThis is the general expression for the Hill coefficient as a function of ligand concentration.\n\nWe must evaluate this expression at half-saturation, i.e., where $\\theta=0.5$. We find the value of $x$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$\\theta(x) = 0.5 \\implies \\frac{x + cx^2}{1 + 2x + cx^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$2(x + cx^2) = 1 + 2x + cx^2$$\n$$2x + 2cx^2 = 1 + 2x + cx^2$$\n$$2cx^2 - cx^2 = 1$$\n$$cx^2 = 1$$\nSince $x = L/K_d > 0$ and $c > 0$, we have $x = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this specific value of $x$ into the expression for $n_H(x)$:\n$$n_H \\bigg|_{\\theta=0.5} = 1 + \\frac{c(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}})}{1+c(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}})} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}}{1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}}$$\n$$n_H = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{1+\\sqrt{c}} - \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{c}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{c}+1}{\\sqrt{c}}}$$\n$$n_H = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{1+\\sqrt{c}} - \\frac{1}{1+\\sqrt{c}}$$\nCombining the terms with a common denominator:\n$$n_H = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{c}}{1+\\sqrt{c}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{c}-1}{1+\\sqrt{c}} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{c}+\\sqrt{c}-1}{1+\\sqrt{c}}$$\n$$n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{c}}{1+\\sqrt{c}}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the Hill coefficient at half-saturation in terms of the cooperativity factor $c$.\n\nThe magnitude and sign of cooperativity are reflected in this result. The Hill coefficient $n_H$ measures the steepness of the dose-response curve at its midpoint, which is a key indicator of cooperativity.\n1.  For **non-cooperative binding**, the binding events are independent, corresponding to $c=1$. In this case, $n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{1}}{1+\\sqrt{1}} = \\frac{2}{2} = 1$, which is the expected value for independent, identical sites.\n2.  For **positive cooperativity**, binding of the first ligand enhances the affinity for the second, so $c>1$. This leads to $n_H > 1$. As $c \\to \\infty$ (infinitely strong cooperativity), $n_H \\to \\frac{2\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{c}} = 2$. Thus, $1 < n_H < 2$. A larger value of $n_H$ signifies stronger positive cooperativity and a more switch-like system response. The upper limit of $2$ reflects the total number of interacting sites.\n3.  For **negative cooperativity**, binding of the first ligand reduces the affinity for the second, so $0 < c < 1$. This leads to $n_H < 1$. As $c \\to 0$ (infinitely strong negative cooperativity, where the second site is essentially unbindable after the first is occupied), $n_H \\to 0$. Thus, $0 < n_H < 1$. A smaller value of $n_H$ signifies stronger negative cooperativity and a shallower binding curve, spread over a wider range of ligand concentrations.\nIn summary, the value of $n_H$ relative to $1$ directly reports on the nature and strength of cooperativity in this two-site system.",

This is the expectation of the single-cell signal, $S(L, R_{\\mathrm{tot}})$, taken over the distribution of $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L) = E\\left[ S(L, R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) \\right] = E\\left[ \\alpha \\frac{L R_{\\mathrm{tot}}}{K_{D} + L} \\right]$$\nSince $\\alpha$, $L$, and $K_{D}$ are constants with respect to the receptor abundance $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, we can factor them out of the expectation operator:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L) = \\alpha \\frac{L}{K_{D} + L} E[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$$\n\nThe problem states that the receptor abundance $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is heterogeneous and follows a log-normal distribution, specified by giving the distribution of its logarithm: $\\ln(R_{\\mathrm{tot}}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$. Let a random variable $X = \\ln(R_{\\mathrm{tot}})$. Then $X$ is normally distributed with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$. The variable $R_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is therefore $R_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\exp(X)$. The expectation of a log-normally distributed variable is a standard result given by:\n$$E[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}] = E[\\exp(X)] = \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this expected value back into the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L)$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L) = \\alpha \\frac{L}{K_{D} + L} \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio $\\rho = S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L) / S_{\\mathrm{single}}(L)$.\n$$\\rho = \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{pop}}(L)}{S_{\\mathrm{single}}(L)} = \\frac{\\alpha \\frac{L}{K_{D} + L} \\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)}{\\alpha \\frac{L R_{0}}{K_{D} + L}}$$\nThe terms $\\alpha$, $L$, and $(K_{D} + L)$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{\\exp\\left(\\mu + \\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\right)}{R_{0}}$$\n\nThis expression provides the ratio $\\rho$ in terms of the given parameters $\\mu$, $\\sigma$, and $R_{0}$. As evident from the final expression, the ratio $\\rho$ is independent of the ligand concentration $L$. This occurs because both the single-cell signal and the population-averaged signal have the same functional dependence on $L$, which cancels in the ratio. The ratio simply compares the mean of the receptor distribution, $E[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$, to the reference receptor number, $R_{0}$.",
