The two-state CTMC is a fundamental and widely used model in neuroscience and cell biology. The assumptions are standard for such models. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is mathematically well-defined. The parameters ($k_{CO}$, $k_{OC}$) are provided, and the framework (CTMC) is specified. The task is to derive standard, uniquely defined properties of this process. The positive rates ensure the chain is irreducible and recurrent, and since it is finite-state, it is ergodic, consistent with the stated assumption.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language. There are no subjective or ambiguous terms.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. A solution will be derived following the specified constraints.\n\n### Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of mean dwell times from the properties of sojourn times, and second, the derivation of the stationary probability from the master equation.\n\n**1. Mean Open Time and Mean Closed Time**\n\nThe problem states that the system is a continuous-time Markov chain and that dwell times are governed by the Markov property. A key consequence of the Markov property for a CTMC is that the sojourn time (or dwell time) in any given state $i$ follows an exponential distribution. The rate parameter of this exponential distribution is the total rate of exiting state $i$.\n\nLet $T_O$ be the random variable representing the dwell time in the Open state ($O$), and $T_C$ be the random variable representing the dwell time in the Closed state ($C$).\n\nFor the **Open state ($O$)**: The only possible transition is from $O$ to $C$, which occurs with a constant rate $k_{OC}$. Therefore, the total escape rate from state $O$ is $\\lambda_O = k_{OC}$. The dwell time $T_O$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $k_{OC}$.\nThe probability density function is $f_{T_O}(t) = k_{OC} \\exp(-k_{OC} t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe mean of an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\\lambda$ is $1/\\lambda$. Thus, the mean open time, $\\langle T_O \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\langle T_O \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{OC}}\n$$\n\nFor the **Closed state ($C$)**: The only possible transition is from $C$ to $O$, which occurs with a constant rate $k_{CO}$. The total escape rate from state $C$ is $\\lambda_C = k_{CO}$. The dwell time $T_C$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $k_{CO}$.\nThe probability density function is $f_{T_C}(t) = k_{CO} \\exp(-k_{CO} t)$ for $t \\ge 0$.\nThe mean closed time, $\\langle T_C \\rangle$, is:\n$$\n\\langle T_C \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{CO}}\n$$\n\n**2. Stationary Open Probability**\n\nThe stationary distribution is found by solving the Kolmogorov forward equations (also known as the master equation) under the steady-state condition. Let $\\pi_C$ and $\\pi_O$ be the stationary probabilities of the channel being in the Closed and Open states, respectively.\n\nThe master equation for this two-state system describes the rate of change of the probabilities $P_C(t)$ and $P_O(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP_C(t)}{dt} = -k_{CO} P_C(t) + k_{OC} P_O(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP_O(t)}{dt} = k_{CO} P_C(t) - k_{OC} P_O(t)\n$$\nIn the stationary state (as $t \\to \\infty$), the probabilities are constant, so the time derivatives are zero. We replace $P_C(t)$ with $\\pi_C$ and $P_O(t)$ with $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n0 = -k_{CO} \\pi_C + k_{OC} \\pi_O \\quad \\implies \\quad k_{CO} \\pi_C = k_{OC} \\pi_O\n$$\nThis equation expresses the principle of detailed balance: at steady state, the probabilistic flux from state $C$ to $O$ equals the flux from $O$ to $C$.\n\nTo solve for the individual probabilities, we use the normalization condition, which states that the sum of all probabilities must equal $1$:\n$$\n\\pi_C + \\pi_O = 1\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for $\\pi_C$ and $\\pi_O$. From the detailed balance equation, we express $\\pi_C$ in terms of $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_C = \\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}} \\pi_O\n$$\nSubstituting this into the normalization equation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}}\\right) \\pi_O + \\pi_O = 1\n$$\nFactoring out $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_O \\left(\\frac{k_{OC}}{k_{CO}} + 1\\right) = 1\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_O \\left(\\frac{k_{OC} + k_{CO}}{k_{CO}}\\right) = 1\n$$\nSolving for the stationary open probability, $\\pi_O$:\n$$\n\\pi_O = \\frac{k_{CO}}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given rate constants are $k_{CO} = 20\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{OC} = 80\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\n-   **Mean Open Time**:\n    $$\n    \\langle T_O \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{OC}} = \\frac{1}{80}\\,\\text{s} = 0.0125\\,\\text{s}\n    $$\n-   **Mean Closed Time**:\n    $$\n    \\langle T_C \\rangle = \\frac{1}{k_{CO}} = \\frac{1}{20}\\,\\text{s} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}\n    $$\n-   **Stationary Open Probability**:\n    $$\n    \\pi_O = \\frac{k_{CO}}{k_{CO} + k_{OC}} = \\frac{20}{20 + 80} = \\frac{20}{100} = \\frac{1}{5} = 0.2\n    $$\n\nThe results are: a mean open time of $0.0125$ seconds, a mean closed time of $0.05$ seconds, and a stationary open probability of $0.2$.",

The master equation and the structure of the generator matrix are standard and well-established formalisms. The generator matrix $R$ correctly represents the specified nearest-neighbor transition scheme: for example, the rate of change of $p_{C_2}$ is given by $(\\frac{dp_{C_2}}{dt}) = k p_{C_1} + k p_O - 2k p_{C_2}$, which corresponds to the second row of the matrix equation.

Let $p_C$, $p_O$, and $p_B$ be the steady-state probabilities for the states $C$, $O$, and $B$, respectively.\n\nThe balance equations are:\n$1.$ Flow between $C$ and $O$:\n$$ \\alpha p_C = \\beta p_O $$\nThis allows us to express $p_C$ in terms of $p_O$:\n$$ p_C = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} p_O $$\n\n$2.$ Flow between $O$ and $B$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D] p_O = k_{\\mathrm{off}} p_B $$\nThis allows us to express $p_B$ in terms of $p_O$:\n$$ p_B = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} p_O $$\n\nThe probabilities must sum to unity:\n$$ p_C + p_O + p_B = 1 $$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $p_C$ and $p_B$ into the normalization equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) p_O + p_O + \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}\\right) p_O = 1 $$\n$$ p_O \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}\\right) = 1 $$\nSolving for $p_O$:\n$$ p_O = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\n\nThe problem first asks for the steady-state fraction of channels in the blocked state, $p_B$. We can find this by substituting the expression for $p_O$ into the relation for $p_B$:\n$$ p_B = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} p_O = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\n\nNext, we must compute the fractional reduction in macroscopic current, $1 - I/I_0$.\nThe currents are given by $I = N g (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) p_O$ and $I_0 = N g (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) p_O^0$.\nThe ratio $I/I_0$ is:\n$$ \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\frac{N g (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) p_O}{N g (V - E_{\\mathrm{rev}}) p_O^0} = \\frac{p_O}{p_O^0} $$\nHere, $p_O^0$ is the steady-state open probability in the absence of drug ($[D]=0$). When $[D]=0$, the state $B$ is inaccessible, and the model reduces to a two-state system:\n$$ C \\underset{\\beta}{\\stackrel{\\alpha}{\\rightleftharpoons}} O $$\nFor this two-state system, the steady-state balance is $\\alpha p_C^0 = \\beta p_O^0$ and the normalization is $p_C^0 + p_O^0 = 1$.\nSubstituting $p_C^0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} p_O^0$ into the normalization gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} p_O^0 + p_O^0 = 1 \\implies p_O^0 \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) = 1 $$\n$$ p_O^0 = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}} $$\nThe fractional current reduction is $1 - \\frac{p_O}{p_O^0}$. Let's compute this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_O}{p_O^0} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}}}{\\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\nTherefore, the fractional reduction is:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{I}{I_0} = 1 - \\frac{p_O}{p_O^0} = 1 - \\frac{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}\\right) - \\left(1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right)}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}}{1 + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} + \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}} $$\nThis expression is identical to the one we derived for $p_B$. Thus, the fractional reduction in current is equal to the probability of being in the blocked state.\n$$ 1 - \\frac{I}{I_0} = p_B $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\alpha = 8.0 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\beta = 1.2 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{off}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$[D] = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}$\n\nWe calculate the dimensionless ratios required:\n$$ \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{3}}{8.0 \\times 10^{2}} = \\frac{12}{8} = 1.5 $$\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{on}}[D]}{k_{\\mathrm{off}}} = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M})}{1.5 \\times 10^{1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{4.5}{15} = 0.3 $$\nNow, we compute the fractional reduction:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{I}{I_0} = \\frac{0.3}{1 + 1.5 + 0.3} = \\frac{0.3}{2.8} = \\frac{3}{28} $$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$ \\frac{3}{28} \\approx 0.107142857... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe result is $0.1071$.",
