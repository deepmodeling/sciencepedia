Assume a constant synthesis rate $k_{s}$ (concentration per unit time) and first-order degradation characterized by a rate constant $k_{d}$ (per unit time). Starting from the conservation of mass principle for a closed compartment (no advective inflow or outflow), formulate the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $P(t)$ based on the net balance of sources and sinks. Derive the closed-form analytic solution for $P(t)$ in terms of $P_{0}$, $k_{s}$, $k_{d}$, and $t$, and then interpret the limiting behaviors as $t \\to 0^{+}$ and $t \\to \\infty$ in the context of approach to steady state and dependence on the initial condition.

            "solution": "The core principle for formulating the governing differential equation is the conservation of mass. For a well-mixed compartment, the rate of change of the protein concentration, $\\frac{dP(t)}{dt}$, is the sum of the rates of all source (production) processes minus the sum of the rates of all sink (removal) processes.\n\nRate of change = Rate of synthesis - Rate of degradation\n\nThe problem states a constant synthesis rate, which is a zero-order process. Its contribution to the rate of change is simply the constant $k_{s}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of synthesis} = k_{s}\n$$\nThe degradation is a first-order process, which means its rate is directly proportional to the current concentration $P(t)$. The constant of proportionality is the degradation rate constant $k_{d}$.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of degradation} = k_{d} P(t)\n$$\nCombining these terms yields the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} = k_{s} - k_{d} P(t)\n$$\nThis is a first-order, linear, non-homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. To solve it, we can rearrange it into the standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + k_{d} P(t) = k_{s}\n$$\nThis ODE can be solved using an integrating factor, $I(t)$. The integrating factor is given by:\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k_{d} \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(k_{d} t)\n$$\nMultiplying the entire standard-form ODE by the integrating factor $I(t)$ gives:\n$$\n\\exp(k_{d} t) \\frac{dP(t)}{dt} + k_{d} \\exp(k_{d} t) P(t) = k_{s} \\exp(k_{d} t)\n$$\nThe left-hand side of this equation is, by the product rule of differentiation, the derivative of the product of $P(t)$ and the integrating factor $I(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ P(t) \\exp(k_{d} t) \\right] = k_{s} \\exp(k_{d} t)\n$$\nTo find the solution, we integrate both sides with respect to time $t$:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ P(t) \\exp(k_{d} t) \\right] dt = \\int k_{s} \\exp(k_{d} t) dt\n$$\n$$\nP(t) \\exp(k_{d} t) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\exp(k_{d} t) + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. To find the explicit solution for $P(t)$, we divide by $\\exp(k_{d} t)$:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} + C \\exp(-k_{d} t)\n$$\nThe value of the integration constant $C$ is determined by applying the initial condition $P(0) = P_{0}$:\n$$\nP(0) = P_{0} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} + C \\exp(-k_{d} \\cdot 0) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} + C\n$$\nSolving for $C$:\n$$\nC = P_{0} - \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ back into the general solution gives the final closed-form analytic solution for $P(t)$:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} + \\left( P_{0} - \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\right) \\exp(-k_{d} t)\n$$\nThis solution can be rearranged into an equivalent and often more intuitive form by separating the terms:\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} - \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\exp(-k_{d} t) + P_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t)\n$$\n$$\nP(t) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{d} t)\\right) + P_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t)\n$$\n\nNext, we interpret the limiting behaviors of this solution.\n\n**Limit as $t \\to 0^{+}$:**\nAs time approaches zero from the positive side, we evaluate the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} P(t) = \\lim_{t \\to 0^{+}} \\left[ \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{d} t)\\right) + P_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t) \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\exp(0) = 1$, the limit becomes:\n$$\nP(t \\to 0^{+}) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} (1 - 1) + P_{0}(1) = 0 + P_{0} = P_{0}\n$$\nThis confirms that the solution is continuous at $t=0$ and correctly returns the initial condition $P_{0}$, as required by the physics of the system.\n\n**Limit as $t \\to \\infty$:**\nAs time tends to infinity, the exponential term $\\exp(-k_{d} t)$ approaches zero, given that the degradation constant $k_{d}$ must be positive for degradation to occur.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} P(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} \\left(1 - \\exp(-k_{d} t)\\right) + P_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nP(t \\to \\infty) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}} (1 - 0) + P_{0}(0) = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}}\n$$\nThis limiting value is the steady-state concentration, denoted $P_{ss}$. At steady state, the concentration is time-invariant, meaning $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0$. From our original ODE, this implies $0 = k_{s} - k_{d} P_{ss}$, which gives $P_{ss} = \\frac{k_{s}}{k_{d}}$. Our solution correctly converges to this value. The interpretation is that, after a sufficiently long time, the system reaches an equilibrium where the rate of protein synthesis is exactly balanced by the rate of protein degradation. It is crucial to note that this steady-state value is independent of the initial concentration $P_{0}$. The term $P_{0} \\exp(-k_{d} t)$ represents the transient influence of the initial state, which decays exponentially over time, leaving a final state determined solely by the balance of the synthesis and degradation rates.",

Protein degradation occurs via a first-order process with rate constant $k_{d}$ (per molecule per unit time), so that when there are $n$ molecules present, the degradation propensity is $k_{d}\\,n$.

The Chemical Master Equation (CME) describes the time evolution of this probability distribution. For a state with $n$ molecules, the probability can increase due to synthesis from a state with $n-1$ molecules or degradation from a state with $n+1$ molecules. The probability can decrease due to synthesis to a state with $n+1$ molecules or degradation to a state with $n-1$ molecules.\n\nThe CME for this system is:\n$$ \\frac{dp_n(t)}{dt} = k_s p_{n-1}(t) + k_d(n+1)p_{n+1}(t) - (k_s + k_d n)p_n(t) $$\nThis equation holds for $n \\ge 1$.
