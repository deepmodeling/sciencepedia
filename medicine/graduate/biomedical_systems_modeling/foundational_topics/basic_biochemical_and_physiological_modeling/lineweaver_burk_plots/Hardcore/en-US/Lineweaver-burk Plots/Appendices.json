The Lineweaver-Burk plot linearizes this relationship by plotting the reciprocals of both variables, providing a straightforward graphical method for analysis. This first exercise focuses on the fundamental data transformation required to construct such a plot, asking you to convert a single experimental data point $([S], v_0)$ into its corresponding coordinates on a Lineweaver-Burk plot .",
