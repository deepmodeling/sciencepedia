            "problem": "You are asked to show, from first principles of the law of mass action and conservation of mass, that a single-substrate enzyme reaction operating under the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) can be represented by a Hill-type input-output relation with Hill exponent equal to $1$. Your derivation must start from the fundamental reaction scheme $E + S \\rightleftharpoons ES \\rightarrow E + P$ with forward association rate constant $k_{1}$, reverse dissociation rate constant $k_{-1}$, and catalytic rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. Let the total enzyme concentration be $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, substrate concentration be $S$, and product concentration be $P$. Assume $S$ is buffered so that its value is effectively constant on the timescale of formation of $ES$. Use only the law of mass action, conservation of mass, and the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA) for the intermediate $ES$.\n\nTasks:\n1) Derive, using only the law of mass action and the QSSA for the intermediate complex, a closed-form expression for the product formation velocity $v$ in terms of $k_{1}$, $k_{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, and $S$. Also derive the dimensionless fraction of enzyme bound in the complex, defined as the occupancy $\\theta = [ES]/E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n2) Separately, for a one-site noncooperative binding system (which is the $n=1$ case of a Hill-type model), write the most general occupancy function compatible with a single binding site that is monotone in the ligand concentration, equals $0$ at zero ligand, and tends to $1$ as ligand goes to infinity. Identify the single parameter in that function with the necessary combination of kinetic parameters from part (1) so that the normalized reaction velocity $v/(k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_{\\mathrm{tot}})$ equals the occupancy $\\theta$ for all $S \\ge 0$.\n3) Prove the equivalence found in part (2) by explicit algebraic manipulation starting from the result of part (1) and your chosen one-site occupancy function from part (2).\n4) Implement a program that, for each test case below, computes: (i) the velocity obtained from your derivation in part (1), (ii) the velocity predicted by the $n=1$ Hill-type occupancy from part (2) after your parameter identification, and (iii) the absolute difference between these two velocities.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical kinetics and biomedical systems modeling, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is expressed objectively with a complete and consistent set of givens. The tasks involve a standard derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation and its comparison to the Hill equation, a fundamental concept in biochemistry.\n\nHere is the step-by-step derivation and proof as requested.\n\nThe fundamental reaction scheme for a single-substrate enzyme reaction is given by:\n$$\nE + S \\underset{k_{-1}}{\\stackrel{k_1}{\\rightleftharpoons}} ES \\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{\\longrightarrow} E + P\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the enzyme, $S$ is the substrate, $ES$ is the enzyme-substrate complex, and $P$ is the product. The rate constants are $k_1$ (forward association), $k_{-1}$ (reverse dissociation), and $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$ (catalysis).\n\nThe problem requires a derivation based on three core principles:\n1.  The Law of Mass Action: The rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants.\n2.  Conservation of Mass: The total amount of enzyme is constant.\n3.  The Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA): The concentration of the intermediate complex $ES$ is assumed to be constant over the timescale of product formation.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Product Formation Velocity ($v$) and Occupancy ($\\theta$)**\n\nFirst, we apply the law of mass action to write the differential equation for the rate of change of the enzyme-substrate complex concentration, $[ES]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } ES) - (\\text{rate of breakdown of } ES)\n$$\nThe formation of $ES$ occurs from $E$ and $S$ with rate constant $k_1$. The breakdown of $ES$ occurs either by dissociation back to $E$ and $S$ with rate constant $k_{-1}$ or by catalysis to $E$ and $P$ with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{cat}}$. This gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - k_{-1}[ES] - k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES] = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES]\n$$\nThe velocity of the reaction, $v$, is defined as the rate of product formation:\n$$\nv = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES]\n$$\nNext, we apply the principle of mass conservation for the enzyme. The total enzyme concentration, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, is the sum of the free enzyme concentration, $[E]$, and the concentration of enzyme bound in the complex, $[ES]$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{tot}} = [E] + [ES]\n$$\nThis allows us to express the concentration of free enzyme as:\n$$\n[E] = E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ES]\n$$\nNow, we apply the Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA), which assumes that the concentration of the intermediate complex $[ES]$ changes much more slowly than the substrate and product concentrations, and thus can be considered to be in a steady state, i.e., $\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{d[ES]}{dt} = k_1 [E][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES] = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[E]$ from the conservation law into the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\nk_1 (E_{\\mathrm{tot}} - [ES])[S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES] = 0\n$$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $[ES]$. Expanding the first term:\n$$\nk_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S] - k_1 [ES][S] - (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES] = 0\n$$\nGrouping all terms containing $[ES]$ on one side:\n$$\nk_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S] = k_1 [ES][S] + (k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})[ES]\n$$\n$$\nk_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S] = [ES] (k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}})\n$$\nIsolating $[ES]$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{k_1 E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{k_1 [S] + k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}\n$$\nTo simplify, we divide the numerator and denominator by $k_1$:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{[S] + \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}}\n$$\nWe define the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, as the specific combination of rate constants:\n$$\nK_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}\n$$\nSubstituting $K_M$ into the expression for $[ES]$ yields:\n$$\n[ES] = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nNow we can derive the expression for the reaction velocity, $v$, by substituting this result into the velocity equation $v = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}[ES]$:\n$$\nv = k_{\\mathrm{cat}} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nThis is the renowned Michaelis-Menten equation. The maximum velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{max}}$, is achieved when the enzyme is saturated with substrate (i.e., as $[S] \\to \\infty$), which gives $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n\nFinally, we derive the dimensionless occupancy, $\\theta$, defined as the fraction of enzyme bound in the complex:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[ES]}{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $[ES]$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{1}{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation for Task 1.\n\n**Task 2: One-Site Occupancy Function and Parameter Identification**\n\nThe Hill equation describes cooperative binding. For a general number of binding sites, $n$, the occupancy $\\theta$ as a function of ligand concentration $[S]$ is given by:\n$$\n\\theta([S]) = \\frac{[S]^n}{K_d^n + [S]^n}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the Hill exponent and $K_d$ is the apparent dissociation constant. A one-site noncooperative binding system corresponds to a Hill exponent of $n=1$. The occupancy function is therefore:\n$$\n\\theta([S]) = \\frac{[S]}{K_d + [S]}\n$$\nThis function satisfies the required properties:\n- It is monotonic in $[S]$.\n- At zero ligand concentration, $\\theta(0) = 0$.\n- It saturates at high ligand concentration, $\\lim_{[S]\\to\\infty} \\theta([S]) = 1$.\nThe single parameter in this model is the dissociation constant $K_d$.\n\nThe problem asks us to identify this parameter $K_d$ by equating the occupancy $\\theta$ to the normalized reaction velocity, $\\frac{v}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}}$. From Task 1, we have $v = \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$, where $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\nThe normalized velocity is:\n$$\n\\frac{v}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}} = \\frac{1}{v_{\\mathrm{max}}} \\left( \\frac{v_{\\mathrm{max}}[S]}{K_M + [S]} \\right) = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nEquating the Hill occupancy function for $n=1$ with this normalized velocity:\n$$\n\\frac{[S]}{K_d + [S]} = \\frac{[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n$$\nFor this equality to hold for all substrate concentrations $[S] \\ge 0$, the parameters in the denominators must be equal. Thus, we identify the dissociation constant $K_d$ from the binding model with the Michaelis constant $K_M$ from the kinetic model:\n$$\nK_d = K_M = \\frac{k_{-1} + k_{\\mathrm{cat}}}{k_1}\n$$\nThis identification shows that the Michaelis-Menten kinetic model is mathematically a special case of the Hill model for $n=1$.\n\n**Task 3: Proof of Equivalence**\n\nWe are asked to prove the equivalence found in Task 2 by explicit algebraic manipulation. The goal is to show that the normalized reaction velocity from the QSSA derivation is identical to the occupancy predicted by the one-site Hill model.\n\n1.  From the QSSA derivation in Task 1, the reaction velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}} E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}$.\n2.  The velocity predicted by the one-site Hill model, $v_{\\mathrm{Hill}, n=1}$, is the product of the maximum possible velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{max}}$, and the Hill occupancy function $\\theta([S])$ with $n=1$:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{Hill}, n=1} = v_{\\mathrm{max}} \\cdot \\theta([S])\n    $$\n3.  The maximum velocity is $v_{\\mathrm{max}} = k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}$. The one-site Hill occupancy function is $\\theta([S]) = \\frac{[S]}{K_d + [S]}$. Therefore:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{Hill}, n=1} = (k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}) \\left(\\frac{[S]}{K_d + [S]}\\right)\n    $$\n4.  Applying the parameter identification from Task 2, we set $K_d = K_M$:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{Hill}, n=1} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n    $$\n5.  Comparing this expression to the one derived from QSSA:\n    $$\n    v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{cat}}E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[S]}{K_M + [S]}\n    $$\n    The two expressions are algebraically identical. Thus, we have explicitly proven that $v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = v_{\\mathrm{Hill}, n=1}$ given the identification $K_d = K_M$. This confirms that single-substrate enzyme kinetics under the QSSA can be represented by a Hill-type relation with a Hill exponent of $n=1$. Q.E.D.",

            "solution": "The problem requires a derivation of the linearization used for a Hill plot, starting from the law of mass action, and an explanation of how to estimate the Hill coefficient $n$ and apparent dissociation constant $K_d$ from it. The foundation of this model is the cooperative binding of a ligand $L$ to a receptor $R$.\n\nWe begin by phenomenologically modeling the binding of $n$ ligand molecules to a receptor $R$ as a single concerted step:\n$$ R + nL \\rightleftharpoons RL_n $$\nThis reaction assumes that all $n$ binding sites on the receptor are either simultaneously empty or simultaneously occupied. While this is a simplification, it provides a useful macroscopic description of cooperative binding.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, at equilibrium, the macroscopic association constant, $K_a$, is given by the ratio of the concentration of the product to the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$ K_a = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R][L]^n} $$\nIt is often more convenient to work with the macroscopic dissociation constant, $K_D$, which is the reciprocal of $K_a$:\n$$ K_D = \\frac{1}{K_a} = \\frac{[R][L]^n}{[RL_n]} $$\n\nThe fractional occupancy, $Y$, is defined as the fraction of total receptor binding sites that are occupied by the ligand. Within this all-or-none model, the concentration of occupied sites is represented by the concentration of the fully bound complex, $[RL_n]$, and the total concentration of receptor sites is proportional to the total receptor concentration, $[R]_{\\text{total}} = [R] + [RL_n]$. Thus, the fractional occupancy is:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R]_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{[RL_n]}{[R] + [RL_n]} $$\n\nTo express $Y$ as a function of the ligand concentration $[L]$, we can rearrange the equilibrium expression for $K_D$ to solve for the concentration of free receptor, $[R]$:\n$$ [R] = \\frac{K_D [RL_n]}{[L]^n} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[R]$ into the equation for $Y$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[RL_n]}{\\frac{K_D [RL_n]}{[L]^n} + [RL_n]} $$\nWe can cancel the term $[RL_n]$ from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ Y = \\frac{1}{\\frac{K_D}{[L]^n} + 1} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_D + [L]^n} $$\nThis equation is a form of the Hill equation. The constant $K_D$ is related to the ligand concentration that results in half-maximal occupancy. Let's define the apparent dissociation constant, $K_d$, as precisely this concentration: the value of $[L]$ for which $Y=0.5$. Substituting $Y=0.5$ and $[L]=K_d$ into the equation:\n$$ 0.5 = \\frac{K_d^n}{K_D + K_d^n} \\implies 0.5(K_D + K_d^n) = K_d^n \\implies 0.5 K_D = 0.5 K_d^n \\implies K_D = K_d^n $$\nBy substituting $K_D = K_d^n$ back into our equation for $Y$, we obtain the standard Hill equation in terms of the apparent dissociation constant $K_d$:\n$$ Y = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_d^n + [L]^n} $$\nHere, $n$ is the Hill coefficient which quantifies the degree of cooperativity ($n1$ for positive cooperativity, $n1$ for negative cooperativity, and $n=1$ for non-cooperative binding) and $K_d$ is the ligand concentration that yields half-occupancy.\n\nTo estimate $n$ and $K_d$ from experimental data $([L]_i, Y_i)$, we must first linearize the Hill equation. We can rearrange the equation to express the ratio of occupied to unoccupied sites:\n$$ Y(K_d^n + [L]^n) = [L]^n $$\n$$ Y K_d^n = [L]^n - Y[L]^n = [L]^n(1-Y) $$\n$$ \\frac{Y}{1-Y} = \\frac{[L]^n}{K_d^n} = \\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_d}\\right)^n $$\nThe term $Y/(1-Y)$ is known as the odds of binding. Taking the natural logarithm (as specified by the problem) of both sides yields a linear relationship:\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{Y}{1-Y}\\right) = \\log\\left(\\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_d}\\right)^n\\right) $$\n$$ \\log\\left(\\frac{Y}{1-Y}\\right) = n \\log\\left(\\frac{[L]}{K_d}\\right) = n\\log([L]) - n\\log(K_d) $$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y_{\\text{fit}} = m x_{\\text{fit}} + c$, which is the basis for the Hill plot. We can identify the components:\n- The dependent variable is $y_{\\text{fit}} = \\log\\left(\\frac{Y}{1-Y}\\right)$.\n- The independent variable is $x_{\\text{fit}} = \\log([L])$.\n- The slope is $m = n$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = -n\\log(K_d)$.\n\nGiven a set of experimental data points $([L]_i, Y_i)$, we first transform them into the coordinates $(x_{\\text{fit}, i}, y_{\\text{fit}, i}) = (\\log([L]_i), \\log(Y_i/(1-Y_i)))$. A practical consideration is that for values of $Y$ very close to $0$ or $1$, the term $\\log(Y/(1-Y))$ will approach $-\\infty$ or $+\\infty$, respectively. To avoid numerical instability, we first clip the observed $Y$ values to a small, machine-representable interval away from the boundaries, such as $(\\varepsilon, 1-\\varepsilon)$ for a small $\\varepsilon  0$. The problem specifies using $\\varepsilon = 10^{-12}$.\n\nWith the transformed data, we can perform an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to find the best-fit slope, $\\hat{m}$, and intercept, $\\hat{c}$, that minimize the sum of squared residuals. From these fitted parameters, we estimate the Hill parameters:\n1. The Hill coefficient, $n$, is estimated directly from the slope:\n   $$ \\hat{n} = \\hat{m} $$\n2. The apparent dissociation constant, $K_d$, is estimated from the slope and intercept. From $\\hat{c} = -\\hat{n}\\log(\\hat{K}_d)$, we can solve for $\\hat{K}_d$:\n   $$ \\log(\\hat{K}_d) = -\\frac{\\hat{c}}{\\hat{n}} $$\n   $$ \\hat{K}_d = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\hat{c}}{\\hat{m}}\\right) $$\n\nThe algorithm implemented in the code follows these steps for each provided dataset. It transforms the raw $([L], Y)$ data into the linear Hill plot coordinates $(\\log([L]), \\log(Y/(1-Y)))$, performs an OLS fit to extract the slope and intercept, and then calculates the estimates for $n$ and $K_d$ using the relationships derived above.",

By building a model from the ground up using a binding polynomial, you will not only calculate the mean occupancy but also the variance, or fluctuations, around that mean.

            "problem": "A ligand binds to a receptor that is a homodimer with two identical binding sites. Binding is at thermodynamic equilibrium in a well-stirred bath at fixed ligand concentration $c$. Each microstate is characterized by the number $k \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$ of occupied sites. The degeneracy of the $k$-occupied microstate is $g_k = \\binom{2}{k}$. In the absence of cooperativity, the microscopic association constant for each site is $K$ (with $K$ having units of inverse concentration), so that the basic weight factor for $k$ occupied sites is $(K c)^k$. Positive cooperativity is modeled by a dimensionless pairwise factor $\\alpha  1$ that multiplies the statistical weight for each occupied pair, so that a state with $k$ occupied sites acquires an additional factor $\\alpha^{k(k-1)/2}$. Assume that these weights, together with the degeneracy, determine the equilibrium probabilities by normalization.\n\nStarting from the law of mass action for microstates and the above definitions:\n\n- Derive the binding polynomial (partition function) $Z(c)$, and from it obtain expressions for the mean occupancy $\\langle k \\rangle$ and the variance $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$ as functions of $c$, $K$, and $\\alpha$.\n- Determine the ligand concentration $c_{1/2}$ such that the mean fractional occupancy $\\theta = \\langle k \\rangle / 2$ equals $0.5$.\n- Evaluate the variance of the fractional occupancy, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Var}(k)/4$, at $c = c_{1/2}$ for a cooperativity parameter $\\alpha = 9$.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation before proceeding to a solution.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A ligand binds to a homodimer with two identical binding sites ($N=2$).\n- Binding is at thermodynamic equilibrium.\n- Ligand concentration is fixed at $c$.\n- Microstates are characterized by the number of occupied sites, $k \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$.\n- The degeneracy of the $k$-occupied microstate is $g_k = \\binom{2}{k}$.\n- Microscopic association constant for each site is $K$.\n- Basic weight factor for $k$ occupied sites is $(Kc)^k$.\n- A dimensionless positive cooperativity factor $\\alpha  1$ is introduced.\n- The cooperativity term for a state with $k$ sites is $\\alpha^{k(k-1)/2}$.\n- Task 1: Derive the binding polynomial $Z(c)$, mean occupancy $\\langle k \\rangle$, and variance $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$.\n- Task 2: Determine the ligand concentration $c_{1/2}$ where mean fractional occupancy $\\theta = \\langle k \\rangle / 2 = 0.5$.\n- Task 3: Evaluate $\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Var}(k)/4$ at $c = c_{1/2}$ for $\\alpha = 9$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It presents a standard statistical mechanical model for cooperative ligand binding to a dimeric protein, which is a fundamental concept in biochemistry and biophysics. The use of a partition function (binding polynomial), statistical weights, degeneracy, and a cooperativity factor are all standard elements of such models. The specific form of the cooperativity factor $\\alpha^{k(k-1)/2}$ correctly corresponds to pairwise interactions, as the exponent $\\binom{k}{2} = k(k-1)/2$ counts the number of occupied pairs. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive the requested quantities and compute the final numerical result. The language is objective and mathematically precise. The problem is free of scientific flaws, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe statistical weight, $W_k$, for a state with $k$ bound ligands is given by the product of the degeneracy, the binding contribution, and the cooperativity term.\n$$W_k = g_k (Kc)^k \\alpha^{\\frac{k(k-1)}{2}}$$\nThe system has two binding sites ($N=2$), so $k$ can be $0$, $1$, or $2$.\n\nFor $k=0$:\n$g_0 = \\binom{2}{0} = 1$. The weight is $W_0 = 1 \\cdot (Kc)^0 \\cdot \\alpha^0 = 1$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$g_1 = \\binom{2}{1} = 2$. The weight is $W_1 = 2 \\cdot (Kc)^1 \\cdot \\alpha^0 = 2Kc$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$g_2 = \\binom{2}{2} = 1$. The weight is $W_2 = 1 \\cdot (Kc)^2 \\cdot \\alpha^{\\frac{2(1)}{2}} = \\alpha(Kc)^2$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of $Z(c)$, $\\langle k \\rangle$, and $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$**\n\nThe binding polynomial, or partition function $Z(c)$, is the sum of the statistical weights of all possible microstates.\n$$Z(c) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} W_k = W_0 + W_1 + W_2$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the weights, we obtain:\n$$Z(c) = 1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2$$\n\nThe mean occupancy, $\\langle k \\rangle$, is the average number of bound ligands, calculated as the first moment of the probability distribution $P(k) = W_k/Z(c)$.\n$$\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} k P(k) = \\frac{1}{Z(c)} \\sum_{k=0}^{2} k W_k$$\n$$\\langle k \\rangle = \\frac{0 \\cdot W_0 + 1 \\cdot W_1 + 2 \\cdot W_2}{Z(c)} = \\frac{2Kc + 2\\alpha(Kc)^2}{1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2}$$\n\nThe variance, $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$, is given by $\\operatorname{Var}(k) = \\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle^2$. First, we compute the mean square occupancy, $\\langle k^2 \\rangle$.\n$$\\langle k^2 \\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{2} k^2 P(k) = \\frac{1}{Z(c)} \\sum_{k=0}^{2} k^2 W_k$$\n$$\\langle k^2 \\rangle = \\frac{0^2 \\cdot W_0 + 1^2 \\cdot W_1 + 2^2 \\cdot W_2}{Z(c)} = \\frac{2Kc + 4\\alpha(Kc)^2}{1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2}$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the variance. Let $y = Kc$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(k) = \\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle^2 = \\frac{2y + 4\\alpha y^2}{1+2y+\\alpha y^2} - \\left( \\frac{2y + 2\\alpha y^2}{1+2y+\\alpha y^2} \\right)^2$$\nTo simplify, we put everything over a common denominator, $Z(y)^2 = (1+2y+\\alpha y^2)^2$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(k) = \\frac{(2y + 4\\alpha y^2)(1+2y+\\alpha y^2) - (2y + 2\\alpha y^2)^2}{(1+2y+\\alpha y^2)^2}$$\nExpanding the numerator:\nNumerator $= (2y + 4y^2 + 2\\alpha y^3 + 4\\alpha y^2 + 8\\alpha y^3 + 4\\alpha^2 y^4) - (4y^2 + 8\\alpha y^3 + 4\\alpha^2 y^4)$\nNumerator $= 2y + (4+4\\alpha)y^2 + 10\\alpha y^3 + 4\\alpha^2 y^4 - 4y^2 - 8\\alpha y^3 - 4\\alpha^2 y^4$\nNumerator $= 2y + 4\\alpha y^2 + 2\\alpha y^3 = 2y(1 + 2\\alpha y + \\alpha y^2)$\nSubstituting $y=Kc$ back into the expression:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(k) = \\frac{2Kc + 4\\alpha(Kc)^2 + 2\\alpha(Kc)^3}{(1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2)^2}$$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of $c_{1/2}$**\n\nThe fractional occupancy is $\\theta = \\langle k \\rangle / 2$. We need to find the concentration $c=c_{1/2}$ for which $\\theta = 0.5$. This condition is equivalent to $\\langle k \\rangle = 1$.\n$$\\frac{2Kc + 2\\alpha(Kc)^2}{1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2} = 1$$\n$$2Kc + 2\\alpha(Kc)^2 = 1 + 2Kc + \\alpha(Kc)^2$$\n$$2\\alpha(Kc)^2 - \\alpha(Kc)^2 = 1$$\n$$\\alpha(Kc)^2 = 1$$\n$$(Kc)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}$$\nSince $K$ and $c$ must be positive, we take the positive root:\n$$Kc = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$$\nTherefore, the concentration for half-saturation is:\n$$c_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{K\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$$\n\n**Part 3: Evaluation of Variance**\n\nWe need to evaluate the variance of the fractional occupancy, $\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Var}(k)/4$, at $c = c_{1/2}$ for $\\alpha=9$. At $c = c_{1/2}$, we have the condition $Kc_{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Let's substitute $y = Kc = 1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$ into the expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$.\n\nThe numerator of $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$ is $2y + 4\\alpha y^2 + 2\\alpha y^3$.\n$$2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right) + 4\\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2 + 2\\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^3 = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} + 4\\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right) + 2\\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha^{3/2}}\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} + 4 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} = 4 + \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$$\n\nThe denominator of $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$ is $(1+2y+\\alpha y^2)^2$.\n$$\\left(1 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right) + \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} + \\alpha\\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha}\\right)\\right)^2 = \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} + 1\\right)^2 = \\left(2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2$$\n\nCombining the numerator and denominator to get $\\operatorname{Var}(k)$ at $c_{1/2}$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(k)\\Big|_{c_{1/2}} = \\frac{4 + \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}{\\left(2 + \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{4\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)}{2^2\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{4\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)}{4\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}\\right)^2} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}}$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(k)\\Big|_{c_{1/2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}+1}$$\n\nThe variance of the fractional occupancy is $\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta) = \\operatorname{Var}(k)/4$.\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta)\\Big|_{c_{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}+1}$$\nNow, we substitute the given value $\\alpha = 9$.\n$$\\sqrt{\\alpha} = \\sqrt{9} = 3$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(\\theta)\\Big|_{c_{1/2}, \\alpha=9} = \\frac{1}{4} \\frac{3}{3+1} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{3}{16}$$\nFinally, we convert this fraction to a decimal value rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\frac{3}{16} = 0.1875$$\nThis value has exactly four significant figures.",
