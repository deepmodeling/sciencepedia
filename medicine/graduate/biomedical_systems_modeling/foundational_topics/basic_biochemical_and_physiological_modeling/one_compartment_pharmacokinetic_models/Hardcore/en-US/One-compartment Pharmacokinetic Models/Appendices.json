This first practice challenges you to build the classic one-compartment oral absorption model from the ground up, starting from the fundamental principle of mass balance. By deriving the concentration-time profile yourself and then using calculus to find the time of peak concentration ($t_{\\max}$), you will gain a deep, mechanistic appreciation for one of the most widely used equations in pharmacokinetics .",

            "problem": "A single oral dose with absorbable amount $D$ enters a gastrointestinal depot compartment and is transferred to a systemic (central) compartment that is well-mixed and has volume of distribution $V$. Assume first-order absorption from the depot into the central compartment with absorption rate constant $k_a$, and first-order elimination from the central compartment with elimination rate constant $k$. There is no absorption lag time, no presystemic loss, and no other inputs or outputs. Let $A_g(t)$ and $A_c(t)$ be the amounts in the depot and central compartments at time $t$, respectively, with initial conditions $A_g(0)=D$ and $A_c(0)=0$. The concentration in the central compartment is $C(t)=A_c(t)/V$. \n\nStarting only from mass balance and the definitions above, derive $C(t)$ and determine the time $t_{\\max}>0$ at which $C(t)$ attains its unique peak for the case $k_a>k$. Then, based on the structure of the model and your derivation, state precise parameter and modeling conditions under which the peak is unique (that is, $C(t)$ has exactly one global maximizer on $(0,\\infty)$). Express $t_{\\max}$ in terms of $k_a$ and $k$ only, as a closed-form analytic expression. Do not use or cite any pre-derived concentration–time formulas. No numerical evaluation is required. The final boxed answer must be your expression for $t_{\\max}$ only, without units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it describes a standard, well-posed initial value problem in one-compartment pharmacokinetics, based on established scientific principles and expressed in objective, formalizable language. All necessary parameters and initial conditions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe problem starts from the principle of mass balance. For a given compartment, the rate of change of the amount of substance is the rate of input minus the rate of output.\n\nLet $A_g(t)$ be the amount of drug in the gastrointestinal (depot) compartment and $A_c(t)$ be the amount in the central compartment at time $t$. The rate constants for absorption and elimination are $k_a$ and $k$, respectively.\n\nFor the depot compartment, the only process is first-order absorption into the central compartment. The mass balance equation is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dA_g(t)}{dt} = -k_a A_g(t)\n$$\nThis equation is subject to the initial condition $A_g(0) = D$, where $D$ is the initial absorbable dose. This is a separable ODE, and its solution is:\n$$\nA_g(t) = D \\exp(-k_a t)\n$$\n\nFor the central compartment, the input is the first-order absorption from the depot, $k_a A_g(t)$, and the output is the first-order elimination from the compartment, $k A_c(t)$. The mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_c(t)}{dt} = k_a A_g(t) - k A_c(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the solution for $A_g(t)$, we obtain a first-order linear non-homogeneous ODE for $A_c(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_c(t)}{dt} + k A_c(t) = k_a D \\exp(-k_a t)\n$$\nThis ODE is subject to the initial condition $A_c(0) = 0$. We solve this using an integrating factor, $I(t)$.\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int k \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(kt)\n$$\nMultiplying the ODE by the integrating factor yields:\n$$\n\\exp(kt) \\frac{dA_c(t)}{dt} + k \\exp(kt) A_c(t) = k_a D \\exp(-k_a t) \\exp(kt)\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of the product $A_c(t)I(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(A_c(t) \\exp(kt)\\right) = k_a D \\exp((k - k_a) t)\n$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\nA_c(t) \\exp(kt) = \\int k_a D \\exp((k - k_a) t) \\, dt\n$$\nThe problem specifies the case $k_a > k$, which implies $k_a \\neq k$. Therefore, we can evaluate the integral:\n$$\nA_c(t) \\exp(kt) = \\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} \\exp((k - k_a) t) + C_{int}\n$$\nwhere $C_{int}$ is the constant of integration. To find $A_c(t)$, we divide by $\\exp(kt)$:\n$$\nA_c(t) = \\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} \\exp(-k_a t) + C_{int} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nNow, we apply the initial condition $A_c(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} \\exp(0) + C_{int} \\exp(0)\n$$\n$$\n0 = \\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} + C_{int} \\implies C_{int} = -\\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} = \\frac{k_a D}{k_a - k}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_{int}$ back into the expression for $A_c(t)$:\n$$\nA_c(t) = \\frac{k_a D}{k - k_a} \\exp(-k_a t) + \\frac{k_a D}{k_a - k} \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{k_a D}{k_a - k}$:\n$$\nA_c(t) = \\frac{k_a D}{k_a - k} (\\exp(-kt) - \\exp(-k_a t))\n$$\nThe concentration in the central compartment, $C(t)$, is defined as $A_c(t)$ divided by the volume of distribution $V$:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A_c(t)}{V} = \\frac{k_a D}{V(k_a - k)} (\\exp(-kt) - \\exp(-k_a t))\n$$\nTo find the time $t_{\\max}$ at which the concentration is maximum, we must find the critical points of $C(t)$ by setting its first derivative with respect to time to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\frac{k_a D}{V(k_a - k)} (\\exp(-kt) - \\exp(-k_a t)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{k_a D}{V(k_a - k)} \\left( -k \\exp(-kt) - (-k_a) \\exp(-k_a t) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = \\frac{k_a D}{V(k_a - k)} (k_a \\exp(-k_a t) - k \\exp(-kt))\n$$\nSet $\\frac{dC(t)}{dt} = 0$. Since the parameters $D, V, k_a, k$ are positive constants, the pre-factor is non-zero. Thus, we must have:\n$$\nk_a \\exp(-k_a t) - k \\exp(-kt) = 0\n$$\n$$\nk_a \\exp(-k_a t) = k \\exp(-kt)\n$$\nTo solve for $t$, we rearrange the equation. Assuming $k>0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\exp(-k_a t)}{\\exp(-kt)} = \\frac{k}{k_a} \\implies \\exp((k - k_a)t) = \\frac{k}{k_a}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n(k - k_a) t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k}{k_a}\\right)\n$$\nWe can rewrite $\\ln(k/k_a)$ as $-\\ln(k_a/k)$ and $k-k_a$ as $-(k_a-k)$:\n$$\n-(k_a - k) t = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_a}{k}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n(k_a - k) t = \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_a}{k}\\right)\n$$\nSince the problem states $k_a > k$, we have $k_a - k \\neq 0$, and we can solve for $t$:\n$$\nt = t_{\\max} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_a}{k}\\right)}{k_a - k}\n$$\nThe condition $k_a>k$ ensures that both the numerator $\\ln(k_a/k)$ and the denominator $k_a - k$ are positive, so $t_{\\max} > 0$.\n\nFor the peak to be unique, there must be exactly one global maximizer of $C(t)$ on the interval $(0, \\infty)$. The time $t_{\\max}$ was found by solving $\\frac{dC}{dt}=0$, which simplified to $\\exp((k_a-k)t) = k_a/k$. The function $f(t)=\\exp((k_a-k)t)$ is strictly monotonic for $k_a \\neq k$. Therefore, it can only equal the constant $k_a/k$ at a single value of $t$. This proves that there is only one critical point.\nThe boundary conditions are $C(0)=0$ and $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} C(t) = 0$ (since $k>0$ and $k_a>0$). Because $C(t)>0$ for $t \\in (0, \\infty)$, this single critical point must be the unique global maximum. This holds for any positive values of $k_a$ and $k$.\nThus, the precise conditions for a unique peak are embedded in the model definition itself, provided the physical parameters are positive:\n1.  **Modeling Conditions:** The system is described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption from a depot and first-order elimination from the central compartment following a single administration event. The model must be linear and time-invariant.\n2.  **Parameter Conditions:** The absorbable dose $D$, volume of distribution $V$, absorption rate constant $k_a$, and elimination rate constant $k$ must all be positive real numbers ($D>0, V>0, k_a>0, k>0$). These conditions ensure a non-trivial concentration profile that starts and ends at zero, guaranteeing the unique critical point is a global maximum.",

According to the stated definitions, the drug concentration in the central compartment, $C(t)$, is related to the amount of drug in the body, $A(t)$, and the volume of distribution, $V$, by the fundamental relationship:\n$$\nC(t) = \\frac{A(t)}{V}\n$$\nThis relationship holds for all times $t > 0$. The problem specifies an intravenous bolus dose administered at time $t=0$.

This method approximates the variance of a function of random variables, $f(X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n)$, using a first-order Taylor series expansion of the function around the mean values of the variables $(\\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\dots, \\mu_n)$.
