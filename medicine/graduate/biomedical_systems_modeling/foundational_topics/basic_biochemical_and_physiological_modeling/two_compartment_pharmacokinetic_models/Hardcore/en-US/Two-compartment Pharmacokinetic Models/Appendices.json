A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for three derivations and associated calculations, though only the final result of the third part is to be reported as the answer. The derivations will be performed from first principles as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Clearance ($CL$)**\nClearance ($CL$) is defined as the proportionality constant relating the rate of drug elimination from the body to the drug concentration in a reference fluid, typically plasma. For a model with elimination from the central compartment, this is:\n$$CL = \\frac{\\text{Rate of Elimination}}{C_c}$$\nwhere $C_c$ is the drug concentration in the central compartment. The rate of elimination is given by the product of the first-order elimination rate constant $k_{10}$ and the amount of drug in the central compartment, $A_c$.\n$$\\text{Rate of Elimination} = k_{10} A_c$$\nThe concentration in the central compartment is the amount in that compartment divided by its volume, $V_c$:\n$$C_c = \\frac{A_c}{V_c}$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of clearance:\n$$CL = \\frac{k_{10} A_c}{A_c / V_c}$$\nThe term $A_c$ cancels, yielding the expression for clearance:\n$$CL = k_{10} V_c$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$CL = (0.2\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\times (15\\ \\mathrm{L}) = 3.0\\ \\mathrm{L/h}$$\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of Steady-State Volume of Distribution ($V_{ss}$)**\nThe steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, is defined as the ratio of the total amount of drug in the body at steady state, $A_{total,ss}$, to the drug concentration in the central compartment at steady state, $C_{c,ss}$.\n$$V_{ss} = \\frac{A_{total,ss}}{C_{c,ss}}$$\nAt steady state, achieved for instance by a constant rate infusion, the net flux between compartments is zero, and the rate of drug administration equals the rate of elimination. The total amount in the body is the sum of the amounts in the central ($A_{c,ss}$) and peripheral ($A_{p,ss}$) compartments.\n$$A_{total,ss} = A_{c,ss} + A_{p,ss}$$\nThe condition of zero net flux between compartments implies:\n$$k_{12} A_{c,ss} = k_{21} A_{p,ss}$$\nFrom this, we can express the amount in the peripheral compartment in terms of the amount in the central compartment:\n$$A_{p,ss} = \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}} A_{c,ss}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the total amount:\n$$A_{total,ss} = A_{c,ss} + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}} A_{c,ss} = A_{c,ss} \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right)$$\nThe concentration in the central compartment is $C_{c,ss} = A_{c,ss} / V_c$. Now, we substitute these into the definition of $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = \\frac{A_{c,ss} \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right)}{A_{c,ss} / V_c}$$\nThe term $A_{c,ss}$ cancels, yielding the expression for $V_{ss}$:\n$$V_{ss} = V_c \\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right)$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$V_{ss} = (15\\ \\mathrm{L}) \\left(1 + \\frac{0.5\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}{0.1\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}}\\right) = 15 \\times (1 + 5) = 15 \\times 6 = 90\\ \\mathrm{L}$$\n\n**Part 3: Derivation of the Terminal Slope Magnitude**\nThe time evolution of the amounts of drug in the central compartment, $A_c$, and the peripheral compartment, $A_p$, is described by a system of linear first-order ordinary differential equations based on mass balance:\n$$\\frac{dA_c}{dt} = -k_{10} A_c - k_{12} A_c + k_{21} A_p = -(k_{10} + k_{12})A_c + k_{21} A_p$$\n$$\\frac{dA_p}{dt} = k_{12} A_c - k_{21} A_p$$\nIn matrix form, this system is $\\frac{d\\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{A}$, where $\\mathbf{A} = \\begin{pmatrix} A_c \\\\ A_p \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{K} = \\begin{pmatrix} -(k_{10} + k_{12})  k_{21} \\\\ k_{12}  -k_{21} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe solutions to this system are of the form $e^{-\\lambda t}$, where the rate constants $\\lambda$ are the negatives of the eigenvalues of the matrix $\\mathbf{K}$. These are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{K} - (-\\lambda)\\mathbf{I}) = \\det(\\mathbf{K} + \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$.\n$$\\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda - (k_{10} + k_{12})  k_{21} \\\\ k_{12}  \\lambda - k_{21} \\end{pmatrix} = 0$$\nEvaluating the determinant gives the characteristic equation:\n$$(\\lambda - (k_{10} + k_{12}))(\\lambda - k_{21}) - k_{12}k_{21} = 0$$\n$$\\lambda^2 - k_{21}\\lambda - (k_{10} + k_{12})\\lambda + k_{21}(k_{10} + k_{12}) - k_{12}k_{21} = 0$$\n$$\\lambda^2 - (k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{21})\\lambda + k_{10}k_{21} + k_{12}k_{21} - k_{12}k_{21} = 0$$\nThe characteristic equation is:\n$$\\lambda^2 - (k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{21})\\lambda + k_{10}k_{21} = 0$$\nThe roots of this quadratic equation, conventionally denoted $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ (with $\\alpha > \\beta$), are the hybrid rate constants that describe the biexponential decay of drug concentration. The terminal slope on a semi-log plot has a magnitude equal to the smaller positive root, $\\beta$.\nLet's substitute the given numerical values for the rate constants into the quadratic equation:\n$$k_{10} + k_{12} + k_{21} = 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.1 = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\n$$k_{10}k_{21} = (0.2)(0.1) = 0.02\\ (\\mathrm{h}^{-1})^2$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda^2 - 0.8\\lambda + 0.02 = 0$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{0.8 \\pm \\sqrt{(-0.8)^2 - 4(1)(0.02)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{0.8 \\pm \\sqrt{0.64 - 0.08}}{2}$$\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{0.8 \\pm \\sqrt{0.56}}{2}$$\nThe two roots are:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{0.8 + \\sqrt{0.56}}{2} \\quad \\text{(fast disposition rate constant)}$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.8 - \\sqrt{0.56}}{2} \\quad \\text{(slow, terminal elimination rate constant)}$$\nThe terminal slope magnitude is $\\beta$. We now compute its value:\n$$\\sqrt{0.56} \\approx 0.748331477$$\n$$\\beta = \\frac{0.8 - 0.748331477}{2} = \\frac{0.051668523}{2} \\approx 0.0258342615\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as required:\n$$\\beta \\approx 0.02583\\ \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, for a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model under a constant-rate intravenous infusion, $I$. The derivation must commence from the fundamental principles of mass balance and first-order kinetics.\n\nLet $A_{1}(t)$ and $A_{2}(t)$ be the amounts of drug in the central and peripheral compartments, respectively. The dynamics of the system are described by a set of two coupled linear ordinary differential equations.\n\nThe rate of change of the drug amount in the central compartment, $\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt}$, is determined by the balance of rates into and out of the compartment. The rates are:\n- Infusion from the external source: $+I$\n- Return from the peripheral compartment: $+k_{21}A_{2}(t)$\n- Transfer to the peripheral compartment: $-k_{12}A_{1}(t)$\n- Elimination from the system: $-k_{10}A_{1}(t)$\n\nCombining these terms gives the mass balance equation for the central compartment:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = I + k_{21}A_{2}(t) - (k_{12} + k_{10})A_{1}(t)\n$$\n\nThe rate of change of the drug amount in the peripheral compartment, $\\frac{dA_{2}}{dt}$, is determined by the intercompartmental transfer rates:\n- Transfer from the central compartment: $+k_{12}A_{1}(t)$\n- Return to the central compartment: $-k_{21}A_{2}(t)$\n\nThis gives the mass balance equation for the peripheral compartment:\n$$\n\\frac{dA_{2}}{dt} = k_{12}A_{1}(t) - k_{21}A_{2}(t)\n$$\n\nAt steady state, the amounts of drug in each compartment are constant, which implies that their time derivatives are zero. Let $A_{1,ss}$ and $A_{2,ss}$ denote the steady-state amounts. The steady-state condition is $\\frac{dA_{1}}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dA_{2}}{dt} = 0$. Applying this to the differential equations yields a system of algebraic equations:\n$$\n0 = I + k_{21}A_{2,ss} - (k_{12} + k_{10})A_{1,ss} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n0 = k_{12}A_{1,ss} - k_{21}A_{2,ss} \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe can solve this system for $A_{1,ss}$ and $A_{2,ss}$. From equation $(2)$, we express $A_{2,ss}$ in terms of $A_{1,ss}$:\n$$\nk_{21}A_{2,ss} = k_{12}A_{1,ss} \\implies A_{2,ss} = \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}A_{1,ss}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_{21}A_{2,ss}$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$\n0 = I + (k_{12}A_{1,ss}) - (k_{12} + k_{10})A_{1,ss}\n$$\n$$\n0 = I + k_{12}A_{1,ss} - k_{12}A_{1,ss} - k_{10}A_{1,ss}\n$$\n$$\n0 = I - k_{10}A_{1,ss}\n$$\nSolving for $A_{1,ss}$ gives:\n$$\nA_{1,ss} = \\frac{I}{k_{10}}\n$$\nUsing this result, we find $A_{2,ss}$:\n$$\nA_{2,ss} = \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}A_{1,ss} = \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\frac{I}{k_{10}}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the steady-state volume of distribution, $V_{ss}$, as:\n$$\nV_{ss} \\equiv \\frac{A_{1,ss} + A_{2,ss}}{C_{1,ss}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1,ss}$ is the steady-state concentration in the central compartment, given by $C_{1,ss} = A_{1,ss}/V_{1}$.\nFirst, we express $C_{1,ss}$:\n$$\nC_{1,ss} = \\frac{A_{1,ss}}{V_{1}} = \\frac{I/k_{10}}{V_{1}} = \\frac{I}{k_{10}V_{1}}\n$$\nNext, we express the total amount of drug in the body at steady state, $A_{1,ss} + A_{2,ss}$:\n$$\nA_{1,ss} + A_{2,ss} = \\frac{I}{k_{10}} + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\frac{I}{k_{10}} = \\frac{I}{k_{10}}\\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute these expressions into the definition of $V_{ss}$:\n$$\nV_{ss} = \\frac{\\frac{I}{k_{10}}\\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right)}{\\frac{I}{k_{10}V_{1}}}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{I}{k_{10}}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, leaving:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{1}\\left(1 + \\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\\right) = V_{1} + V_{1}\\frac{k_{12}}{k_{21}}\n$$\nThe final step is to express this result purely in terms of $V_{1}$, $Q$, and $k_{21}$. The problem states that the intercompartmental clearance $Q$ is consistent with first-order kinetics. The rate of drug transfer from the central to the peripheral compartment is given by the product of the rate constant and the amount, $k_{12}A_{1}$. In a clearance-based parameterization, this rate is also given by the product of the clearance and the source concentration, $Q C_{1}$. Equating these two valid expressions for the same physical rate:\n$$\nk_{12}A_{1} = Q C_{1}\n$$\nUsing the definition $A_{1} = V_{1}C_{1}$, we have:\n$$\nk_{12}(V_{1}C_{1}) = Q C_{1}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution where $C_{1} \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $C_1$ to find the relationship between the parameters:\n$$\nk_{12}V_{1} = Q \\implies k_{12} = \\frac{Q}{V_{1}}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $k_{12}$ into our equation for $V_{ss}$:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{1} + V_{1}\\frac{(Q/V_{1})}{k_{21}}\n$$\nThe terms $V_{1}$ in the fraction cancel out, yielding the final expression:\n$$\nV_{ss} = V_{1} + \\frac{Q}{k_{21}}\n$$\nThis expression is in terms of the required variables $V_{1}$, $Q$, and $k_{21}$, and represents the steady-state volume of distribution derived from first principles.",
