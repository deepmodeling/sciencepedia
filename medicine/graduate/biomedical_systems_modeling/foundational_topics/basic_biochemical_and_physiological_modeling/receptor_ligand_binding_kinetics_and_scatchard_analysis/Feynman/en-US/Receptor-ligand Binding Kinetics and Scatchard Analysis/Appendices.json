            "solution": "The problem requires the analysis of single-site receptor-ligand binding data using a Scatchard plot and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to determine the dissociation constant ($K_d$) and maximum binding capacity ($B_{\\max}$), including their respective confidence intervals. The solution is developed from first principles of chemical kinetics.\n\n###equilibrium binding relationship\nThe reversible binding of a ligand ($L$) to a single type of receptor ($R$) to form a complex ($RL$) is described by the reaction:\n$$R + L \\underset{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{\\stackrel{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}{\\rightleftharpoons}} RL$$\nAt equilibrium, the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal. The Law of Mass Action gives the relationship between the concentrations of the species, defined by the dissociation constant $K_d$:\n$$K_d = \\frac{[R][L]}{[RL]} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{off}}}{k_{\\mathrm{on}}}$$\nwhere $[R]$ is the concentration of free receptors, $[L]$ is the concentration of free ligand, and $[RL]$ is the concentration of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nThe total concentration of receptors, $[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$, is conserved:\n$$[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}] = [R] + [RL]$$\nFrom this, we can express the free receptor concentration as $[R] = [R_{\\mathrm{tot}}] - [RL]$. Substituting this into the $K_d$ expression:\n$$K_d = \\frac{([R_{\\mathrm{tot}}] - [RL])[L]}{[RL]}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the concentration of bound complex $[RL]$:\n$$K_d [RL] = ([R_{\\mathrm{tot}}] - [RL])[L]$$\n$$K_d [RL] + [RL][L] = [R_{\\mathrm{tot}}][L]$$\n$$[RL](K_d + [L]) = [R_{\\mathrm{tot}}][L]$$\n$$[RL] = \\frac{[R_{\\mathrm{tot}}][L]}{K_d + [L]}$$\nThis equation describes the hyperbolic relationship between the concentration of bound complex and the free ligand concentration. The problem defines the measurable quantities $B$ (bound ligand per mass) and $F$ (free ligand concentration), which are proportional to $[RL]$ and $[L]$ respectively. The maximum binding capacity, $B_{\\max}$, corresponds to the state where all receptors are saturated, i.e., $[RL] = [R_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$. Therefore, we can write the proportionalities as:\n$$B \\propto [RL] \\quad\\quad F \\propto [L] \\quad\\quad B_{\\max} \\propto [R_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$$\nBy absorbing the proportionality constants into the parameters, we can express the relationship in terms of the measurable quantities:\n$$B = \\frac{B_{\\max} F}{K_d + F}$$\nHere, $K_d$ is the dissociation constant expressed in the same concentration units as $F$ (in this case, $\\mathrm{nM}$). This is the fundamental equation for single-site binding.\n\n### Scatchard Transformation and Linear Regression\nTo estimate the parameters $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$ from experimental data, the binding equation can be linearized. The Scatchard transformation is one such method. We rearrange the binding equation:\n$$B(K_d + F) = B_{\\max} F$$\n$$B K_d + B F = B_{\\max} F$$\nDividing the entire equation by $F$ yields:\n$$B \\frac{K_d}{F} + B = B_{\\max}$$\nDividing by $K_d$ and rearranging gives the linear form:\n$$\\frac{B}{F} = -\\frac{1}{K_d} B + \\frac{B_{\\max}}{K_d}$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = B/F$.\n- The independent variable is $x = B$.\n- The slope is $m = -1/K_d$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = B_{\\max}/K_d$.\n\nGiven a set of $n$ data points $(F_i, B_i)$, we transform them into $(x_i, y_i) = (B_i, B_i/F_i)$ and perform an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression to find the best-fit slope $m$ and intercept $c$. From these fitted parameters, we can calculate the kinetic parameters:\n$$K_d = -\\frac{1}{m}$$\n$$B_{\\max} = c \\cdot K_d = c \\left(-\\frac{1}{m}\\right) = -\\frac{c}{m}$$\n\n### Uncertainty Quantification and Confidence Intervals\nTo quantify the uncertainty in our estimates of $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$, we propagate the uncertainty from the OLS parameters $(m, c)$ using the delta method (a first-order Taylor series approximation).\n\nFirst, we estimate the variance of the residuals from the OLS fit. The residuals are $e_i = y_i - (m x_i + c)$. The residual variance, $s_e^2$, is an unbiased estimator of the error variance $\\sigma^2$ and is calculated as:\n$$s_e^2 = \\frac{1}{n-2} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (m x_i + c))^2$$\nThe denominator $n-2$ represents the degrees of freedom, as two parameters ($m$ and $c$) are estimated from the data.\n\nNext, we determine the variance-covariance matrix of the OLS estimators $(m, c)$. The variances and covariance are:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(m) = \\sigma_m^2 = \\frac{s_e^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(c) = \\sigma_c^2 = s_e^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{\\bar{x}^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2} \\right)$$\n$$\\mathrm{Cov}(m, c) = \\sigma_{mc} = -s_e^2 \\frac{\\bar{x}}{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}$$\nwhere $\\bar{x}$ is the mean of the $x_i$ values.\n\nThe variances of $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$ are then approximated using the delta method. For a general function $g(m, c)$, the variance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(g) \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial m}\\right)^2 \\sigma_m^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c}\\right)^2 \\sigma_c^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c}\\right) \\sigma_{mc}$$\n\nFor $K_d(m) = -1/m$:\nThe partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial K_d}{\\partial m} = 1/m^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial K_d}{\\partial c} = 0$. The variance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(K_d) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{m^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_m^2 = \\frac{\\sigma_m^2}{m^4}$$\nThe standard error is $SE(K_d) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(K_d)} = |\\sigma_m / m^2|$.\n\nFor $B_{\\max}(m, c) = -c/m$:\nThe partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial B_{\\max}}{\\partial m} = c/m^2$ and $\\frac{\\partial B_{\\max}}{\\partial c} = -1/m$. The variance is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(B_{\\max}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{c}{m^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_m^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{m}\\right)^2 \\sigma_c^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{c}{m^2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{m}\\right) \\sigma_{mc}$$\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(B_{\\max}) \\approx \\frac{c^2}{m^4}\\sigma_m^2 + \\frac{1}{m^2}\\sigma_c^2 - \\frac{2c}{m^3}\\sigma_{mc}$$\nThe standard error is $SE(B_{\\max}) = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(B_{\\max})}$.\n\nFinally, two-sided confidence intervals at a confidence level of $1-\\alpha=0.95$ are constructed using the critical value $t_{\\alpha/2, n-2}$ from the Student's $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. The confidence interval for a parameter $\\theta$ is given by:\n$$\\theta \\pm t_{\\alpha/2, n-2} \\cdot SE(\\theta)$$\nFor $K_d$ and $B_{\\max}$, the lower and upper bounds of the $95\\%$ confidence intervals are:\n$$K_{d, \\text{low}} = K_d - t_{0.025, n-2} \\cdot SE(K_d) \\quad , \\quad K_{d, \\text{high}} = K_d + t_{0.025, n-2} \\cdot SE(K_d)$$\n$$B_{\\max, \\text{low}} = B_{\\max} - t_{0.025, n-2} \\cdot SE(B_{\\max}) \\quad , \\quad B_{\\max, \\text{high}} = B_{\\max} + t_{0.025, n-2} \\cdot SE(B_{\\max})$$\nThe results are then reported in the format $[K_d, K_{d,\\mathrm{low}}, K_{d,\\mathrm{high}}, B_{\\max}, B_{\\max,\\mathrm{low}}, B_{\\max,\\mathrm{high}}]$ with all values rounded to three decimal places.",
