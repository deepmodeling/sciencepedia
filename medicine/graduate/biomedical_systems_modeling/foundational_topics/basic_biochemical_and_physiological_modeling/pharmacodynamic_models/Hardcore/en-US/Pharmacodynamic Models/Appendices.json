This exercise provides a fundamental practice in deriving a dose-response relationship from these first principles. By analyzing a classic competitive antagonism scenario, you will connect microscopic binding events to a macroscopic and measurable outcome—the shift in the half-maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$). This analytical practice is essential for building a deep, mechanistic understanding of how drugs interact at the molecular level and how these interactions manifest in the physiological response. ",

            "problem": "A receptor-mediated drug response is modeled with a competitive binding scheme under the Law of Mass Action. An agonist, denoted by concentration $C$, binds a single receptor population $R$ to form the complex $AR$ with equilibrium dissociation constant $K_{A}$ defined by $K_{A} = \\dfrac{[R][C]}{[AR]}$. A competitive antagonist, denoted by concentration $I$, binds the same site to form $IR$ with inhibition constant $K_{i}$ defined by $K_{i} = \\dfrac{[R][I]}{[IR]}$. Assume rapid equilibrium, a single binding site, no cooperativity, no spare receptors, and a direct proportionality between effect and fractional receptor occupancy by the agonist. Under these assumptions, the fraction of maximal effect equals the fraction of receptors occupied by the agonist.\n\nYou are given that the half maximal effective concentration ($EC_{50}$) of the agonist in the absence of antagonist is $1$ mg/L and that the Hill coefficient is $1$, so that $EC_{50} = K_{A}$ under the stated assumptions. A competitive antagonist is co-administered at a constant concentration $I = 1$ mg/L with an inhibition constant $K_{i} = 0.5$ mg/L.\n\nUsing only the Law of Mass Action, mass balance on the receptor, and the definition of half maximal effective concentration (the agonist concentration that yields one-half of the maximal effect under the specified condition), derive the apparent half maximal effective concentration in the presence of the antagonist, denoted $EC_{50}'$, and then compute the relative effect (as a dimensionless fraction of the maximal effect in the presence of the antagonist) at agonist concentration $C = 1$ mg/L.\n\nProvide both results as exact values with no rounding. Express $EC_{50}'$ in mg/L and the relative effect as a decimal fraction without a percentage sign. Your final reported answer should contain both values in the order $\\big(EC_{50}', \\text{relative effect at } C=1\\ \\text{mg/L}\\big)$.",
            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. Let $C$ be the concentration of the agonist and $I$ be the concentration of the antagonist. Let $[R]$ be the concentration of free receptors, $[AR]$ be the concentration of agonist-receptor complexes, and $[IR]$ be the concentration of antagonist-receptor complexes. The total concentration of receptors, $[R_T]$, is constant.\n\nThe mass balance equation for the receptors is:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + [AR] + [IR]$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the relationship between effect ($E$) and maximal effect ($E_{max}$) is directly proportional to the fractional occupancy of receptors by the agonist. Let this fractional occupancy be denoted by $\\theta_C$.\n$$\\frac{E}{E_{max}} = \\theta_C = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_T]}$$\n\nThe equilibrium dissociation constant for the agonist, denoted $K_A$, and the inhibition constant for the antagonist, denoted $K_i$, are given by the Law of Mass Action as:\n$$K_A = \\frac{[R]C}{[AR]} \\quad \\implies \\quad [AR] = \\frac{[R]C}{K_A}$$\n$$K_i = \\frac{[R]I}{[IR]} \\quad \\implies \\quad [IR] = \\frac{[R]I}{K_i}$$\n\nWe can express the total receptor concentration $[R_T]$ in terms of the free receptor concentration $[R]$ by substituting the expressions for $[AR]$ and $[IR]$ into the mass balance equation:\n$$[R_T] = [R] + \\frac{[R]C}{K_A} + \\frac{[R]I}{K_i}$$\nFactoring out $[R]$ gives:\n$$[R_T] = [R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{C}{K_A} + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)$$\n\nNow, we can write the expression for the fractional occupancy $\\theta_C$:\n$$\\theta_C = \\frac{[AR]}{[R_T]} = \\frac{\\frac{[R]C}{K_A}}{[R] \\left( 1 + \\frac{C}{K_A} + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nThe term $[R]$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$\\theta_C = \\frac{\\frac{C}{K_A}}{1 + \\frac{C}{K_A} + \\frac{I}{K_i}}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $K_A$:\n$$\\theta_C = \\frac{C}{K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{C}{K_A} + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)} = \\frac{C}{K_A + C + K_A \\frac{I}{K_i}}$$\nRearranging the terms in the denominator gives the dose-response relationship:\n$$\\theta_C = \\frac{C}{C + K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)}$$\n\nThe apparent half maximal effective concentration, $EC_{50}'$, is the agonist concentration $C$ that produces half of the maximal effect, which corresponds to a fractional occupancy $\\theta_C = \\frac{1}{2}$. We set $C = EC_{50}'$ and $\\theta_C = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{EC_{50}'}{EC_{50}' + K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nSolving for $EC_{50}'$:\n$$EC_{50}' + K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right) = 2 \\cdot EC_{50}'$$\n$$EC_{50}' = K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)$$\nThis is the first required derivation. Now, we compute its numerical value.\n\nThe problem provides the following values:\n$EC_{50} = 1$ mg/L. Since the Hill coefficient is $1$ and there are no spare receptors, $K_A = EC_{50} = 1$ mg/L.\nThe antagonist concentration is $I = 1$ mg/L.\nThe inhibition constant is $K_i = 0.5$ mg/L.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $EC_{50}'$:\n$$EC_{50}' = (1 \\text{ mg/L}) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1 \\text{ mg/L}}{0.5 \\text{ mg/L}} \\right)$$\n$$EC_{50}' = 1 \\cdot (1 + 2) = 3 \\text{ mg/L}$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the relative effect at an agonist concentration $C = 1$ mg/L in the presence of the antagonist. The relative effect is equal to the fractional occupancy $\\theta_C$. We use the derived dose-response equation with the known values:\n$$\\text{Relative Effect} = \\theta_C = \\frac{C}{C + K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)}$$\nThe term $K_A \\left( 1 + \\frac{I}{K_i} \\right)$ is simply the apparent $EC_{50}'$ we just calculated.\n$$\\text{Relative Effect} = \\frac{C}{C + EC_{50}'}$$\nSubstituting $C = 1$ mg/L and $EC_{50}' = 3$ mg/L:\n$$\\text{Relative Effect} = \\frac{1}{1 + 3} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n\nThe two required values are the apparent half maximal effective concentration $EC_{50}'$ and the relative effect at $C=1$ mg/L.\n$EC_{50}' = 3$ mg/L.\nRelative effect at $C=1$ mg/L = $0.25$.",

Since $E_{0}$ and $E_{\\max}$ are known constants, they are treated as such in differentiation.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\alpha,n)}{\\partial n} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} f(\\alpha,n) = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n}{1+\\alpha^n} \\right). $$\nUsing the quotient rule for derivatives, with $u = \\alpha^n$ and $v = 1+\\alpha^n$:\nThe derivative of $\\alpha^n$ with respect to $n$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n}(\\exp(n\\ln\\alpha)) = (\\ln\\alpha)\\exp(n\\ln\\alpha) = \\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial f(\\alpha,n)}{\\partial n} = \\frac{(\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha)(1+\\alpha^n) - \\alpha^n(\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha)}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha + \\alpha^{2n}\\ln\\alpha - \\alpha^{2n}\\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} = \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2}. $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial n}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mu(\\alpha,n)}{\\partial n} = E_{\\max} \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2}. $$\nNow, we can find the Fisher information for a single observation:\n$$ I(n) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2} \\left( E_{\\max} \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{E_{\\max}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2. $$\n\n### Part 2: Two-Point Symmetric Design\n\nFor independent observations, the total Fisher information is the sum of the information from each observation. The two-point symmetric design uses concentrations $C_1 = \\alpha EC_{50}$ and $C_2 = EC_{50}/\\alpha$. These correspond to normalized concentrations $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha$ and $\\alpha_2 = 1/\\alpha$.\nThe total Fisher information is $I_{\\text{total}}(n) = I(n; \\alpha_1) + I(n; \\alpha_2)$.\n\n$I(n; \\alpha_1)$ is the information at $\\alpha_1 = \\alpha$, which is the expression derived in Part 1:\n$$ I(n; \\alpha) = \\frac{E_{\\max}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2. $$\n$I(n; \\alpha_2)$ is the information at $\\alpha_2 = 1/\\alpha$. We substitute $1/\\alpha$ for $\\alpha$ in the formula:\n$$ I(n; 1/\\alpha) = \\frac{E_{\\max}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{(1/\\alpha)^n \\ln(1/\\alpha)}{(1+(1/\\alpha)^n)^2} \\right)^2. $$\nLet's simplify the term in the parenthesis. We use $\\ln(1/\\alpha) = -\\ln\\alpha$ and $1+(1/\\alpha)^n = \\frac{\\alpha^n+1}{\\alpha^n}$.\n$$ \\frac{(1/\\alpha)^n (-\\ln\\alpha)}{(\\frac{\\alpha^n+1}{\\alpha^n})^2} = \\frac{\\alpha^{-n} (-\\ln\\alpha)}{(\\alpha^n+1)^2 \\alpha^{-2n}} = \\frac{-\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(\\alpha^n+1)^2}. $$\nSquaring this term gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{-\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(\\alpha^n+1)^2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2. $$\nThis shows that $I(n; 1/\\alpha) = I(n; \\alpha)$.\nThe total Fisher information for the paired design is therefore:\n$$ I_{\\text{total}}(n) = I(n; \\alpha) + I(n; 1/\\alpha) = 2 I(n; \\alpha) = 2 \\frac{E_{\\max}^2}{\\sigma^2} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2. $$\nNow, for the explanation part. Sampling exactly at $C = EC_{50}$ corresponds to $\\alpha=1$. If we substitute $\\alpha=1$ into the single-point information formula, the term $\\ln\\alpha = \\ln 1 = 0$ makes the entire expression zero: $I(n)=0$. Zero Fisher information means the observation provides no information about the parameter $n$. This is because at $C=EC_{50}$, the mean response is $\\mu = E_0 + E_{\\max} \\frac{EC_{50}^n}{EC_{50}^n + EC_{50}^n} = E_0 + \\frac{1}{2}E_{\\max}$, which is a value independent of $n$. Since the measured effect at this concentration does not depend on $n$, it cannot be used to estimate $n$.\n\nSampling around $C \\approx EC_{50}$ is critical because we need to measure the steepness of the dose-response curve to estimate the Hill coefficient $n$. The steepness is related to the derivative of the response with respect to concentration, and $n$ governs this property. The sensitivity of the response to $n$, given by $|\\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial n}|$, is maximized at some optimal concentrations on either side of $EC_{50}$. The Fisher information function $I(n; \\alpha)$ is zero at $\\alpha=1$ and also tends to zero as $\\alpha\\to\\infty$ (since $\\frac{\\ln\\alpha}{\\alpha^n} \\to 0$). This implies there must be a value of $\\alpha  1$ that maximizes the information. The symmetric design at $\\alpha$ and $1/\\alpha$ effectively captures the behavior of the curve on both sides of its inflection point, which is essential for precisely identifying the steepness parameter $n$.\n\n### Part 3: Comparison of Designs\n\nThe Cramér–Rao lower bound (CRLB) provides a lower bound on the variance of any unbiased estimator $\\hat{n}$ of $n$. It is the reciprocal of the Fisher information:\n$$ \\text{Var}(\\hat{n}) \\ge \\text{CRLB}(n) = \\frac{1}{I_{\\text{total}}(n)}. $$\nWe are asked to compute the ratio of the CRLBs for two designs: an extreme design with $\\alpha=10$ and a near-$EC_{50}$ design with $\\alpha=2$, given $n=2$.\n$$ \\frac{\\text{CRLB at } \\alpha=10}{\\text{CRLB at } \\alpha=2} = \\frac{1/I_{\\text{total}}(n=2; \\alpha=10)}{1/I_{\\text{total}}(n=2; \\alpha=2)} = \\frac{I_{\\text{total}}(n=2; \\alpha=2)}{I_{\\text{total}}(n=2; \\alpha=10)}. $$\nUsing the formula for $I_{\\text{total}}$ from Part 2, the constant prefactor $2 \\frac{E_{\\max}^2}{\\sigma^2}$ cancels out in the ratio.\nLet $H(n, \\alpha) = \\left( \\frac{\\alpha^n \\ln\\alpha}{(1+\\alpha^n)^2} \\right)^2$. The ratio is $\\frac{H(2, 2)}{H(2, 10)}$.\n\nFor the near-$EC_{50}$ design ($\\alpha=2, n=2$):\n$$ H(2, 2) = \\left( \\frac{2^2 \\ln 2}{(1+2^2)^2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{4 \\ln 2}{5^2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{4 \\ln 2}{25} \\right)^2. $$\nFor the extreme design ($\\alpha=10, n=2$):\n$$ H(2, 10) = \\left( \\frac{10^2 \\ln 10}{(1+10^2)^2} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{100 \\ln 10}{101^2} \\right)^2. $$\nThe ratio of the CRLBs is:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{CRLB at } \\alpha=10}{\\text{CRLB at } \\alpha=2} = \\frac{H(2, 2)}{H(2, 10)} = \\frac{\\left( \\frac{4 \\ln 2}{25} \\right)^2}{\\left( \\frac{100 \\ln 10}{101^2} \\right)^2} = \\left( \\frac{4 \\ln 2}{25} \\cdot \\frac{101^2}{100 \\ln 10} \\right)^2. $$\nSimplifying the expression inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{4 \\cdot 10201 \\cdot \\ln 2}{2500 \\cdot \\ln 10} \\right)^2 = \\left( \\frac{10201}{625} \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln 10} \\right)^2. $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\frac{10201}{625} = 16.3216. $$\n$$ \\frac{\\ln 2}{\\ln 10} = \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.30103. $$\nThe ratio is approximately:\n$$ (16.3216 \\times 0.30103)^2 \\approx (4.91357)^2 \\approx 24.14316. $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the ratio is $24.14$. This indicates that the variance of an estimator for $n$ is over $24$ times larger for the extreme design ($\\alpha=10$) compared to the near-$EC_{50}$ design ($\\alpha=2$), meaning the latter is far more efficient for estimating $n$.",
