            "solution": "## PROBLEM VALIDATION\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem statement provides the following data, variables, and assumptions:\n- Body mass is denoted by $M$.\n- Aortic length $L_{a} \\propto M^{\\lambda}$, with $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Aortic radius $R_{a} \\propto M^{\\rho}$, with $\\rho = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Aortic wall thickness $h_{a} \\propto M^{\\eta}$, with $\\eta = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- Blood density $\\rho_{b}$ is independent of $M$.\n- Effective arterial wall elastic modulus $E$ is independent of $M$.\n- Strouhal number $S = f L_{a} / c$ is invariant across species, where $f$ is heart rate.\n- Large-artery pulse wave speed $c$ is given by the Moens–Korteweg relation $c \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{E h_{a}}{\\rho_{b} R_{a}}}$.\n- Cardiac output $Q$ satisfies $Q = f V_{s}$, where $V_{s}$ is stroke volume.\n- Cardiac output scales with basal metabolic demand, $Q \\propto M^{3/4}$.\n- Mean arterial pressure $P$ obeys the Laplace law for circumferential hoop stress: $\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P R_{a}}{h_{a}}$.\n- Mechanical similarity implies mass-invariant circumferential strain: $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{E}$ is independent of $M$.\n- The goal is to find the allometric exponent $\\alpha$ in the mass-power law $P(M) \\propto M^{\\alpha}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation against the established criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in established principles of biomechanics and physiology, including geometric similarity, the Moens-Korteweg equation for pulse wave velocity, Laplace's law for wall stress, and Kleiber's law for metabolic rate. These are standard, albeit simplified, models used in cardiovascular system analysis.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. It provides a set of consistent assumptions and requests the derivation of a specific parameter, the scaling exponent $\\alpha$. The information provided is sufficient to determine a unique solution. A check for internal consistency shows that the assumptions do not contradict each other. For instance, from the invariance of the Strouhal number, we can derive the scaling of heart rate $f$. Pulse wave speed $c \\propto \\sqrt{M^0 \\cdot M^{1/3} / (M^0 \\cdot M^{1/3})} = M^0$. Then $f \\propto c/L_a \\propto M^0/M^{1/3} = M^{-1/3}$. From $Q=fV_s$, we find stroke volume $V_s \\propto Q/f \\propto M^{3/4} / M^{-1/3} = M^{3/4 + 1/3} = M^{13/12}$. These derived scalings are consistent within the model and do not create contradictions with the primary assumptions needed to solve for $P$.\n- **Objective:** The language is precise, quantitative, and devoid of subjective or ambiguous statements. All terms are defined within the context of established physical laws.\n- **Other Flaws:** The problem does not violate any other criteria. It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic (within the modeling context), ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n## SOLUTION\nThe objective is to determine the allometric exponent $\\alpha$ in the scaling relationship for mean arterial pressure, $P(M) \\propto M^{\\alpha}$.\n\nThe analysis begins with the assumption based on the Laplace law for a thin-walled tube, which relates mean arterial pressure $P$, aortic radius $R_{a}$, aortic wall thickness $h_{a}$, and circumferential hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} = \\frac{P R_{a}}{h_{a}}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to express the pressure $P$ in terms of the other variables:\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta} h_{a}}{R_{a}}\n$$\nThis equation implies a scaling relationship:\n$$\nP(M) \\propto \\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}(M) h_{a}(M)}{R_{a}(M)}\n$$\nThe problem states that mechanical similarity implies mass-invariant circumferential strain. The strain is given by the ratio of stress to the elastic modulus, $\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{E}$. The statement that this quantity is independent of body mass $M$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{\\theta}}{E} \\propto M^{0}\n$$\nFurthermore, the problem assumes that the effective arterial wall elastic modulus $E$ is independent of body mass $M$. This can be expressed as:\n$$\nE \\propto M^{0}\n$$\nCombining these two conditions, we can deduce the scaling of the hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$. Since $\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto E \\cdot M^{0}$ and $E \\propto M^{0}$, it follows that:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\theta} \\propto M^{0}\n$$\nThe hoop stress $\\sigma_{\\theta}$ is independent of body mass.\n\nNow, we substitute this finding back into the scaling relationship for pressure $P$. We also use the given scaling laws for the aortic radius $R_{a}$ and wall thickness $h_{a}$, which are based on geometric similarity:\n- $h_{a} \\propto M^{\\eta}$, with $\\eta = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n- $R_{a} \\propto M^{\\rho}$, with $\\rho = \\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nSubstituting these scaling laws into the expression for $P(M)$:\n$$\nP(M) \\propto \\frac{(M^{0}) \\cdot (M^{1/3})}{M^{1/3}}\n$$\nWe combine the exponents:\n$$\nP(M) \\propto M^{0 + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3}}\n$$\n$$\nP(M) \\propto M^{0}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the mean arterial pressure $P$ is independent of body mass $M$ under the given set of assumptions. By comparing this result to the target form $P(M) \\propto M^{\\alpha}$, we can identify the value of the exponent $\\alpha$.\n$$\n\\alpha = 0\n$$\nThe additional information provided about cardiac output, heart rate, and pulse wave velocity, while part of a consistent underlying model, is not required for the direct derivation of the pressure scaling exponent.",

Dimensional Analysis for the Viscoelastic Timescale $\\tau_{\\alpha}$**\n\nWe aim to construct a characteristic timescale, denoted $\\tau_{\\alpha}$, from the parameters $E$ and $\\eta_{\\alpha}$. We use dimensional analysis. The units, denoted by square brackets, of the given parameters are:\n- Elastic modulus: $[E] = \\mathrm{Pa} = M L^{-1} T^{-2}$\n- Fractional viscous coefficient: $[\\eta_{\\alpha}] = \\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{\\alpha} = (M L^{-1} T^{-2}) T^{\\alpha} = M L^{-1} T^{\\alpha-2}$\n\nWe seek a combination $\\tau_{\\alpha} \\propto \\eta_{\\alpha}^{x} E^{y}$ such that its dimension is time, $[ \\tau_{\\alpha} ] = T^1$. Expressing this in terms of fundamental dimensions ($M$ for mass, $L$ for length, $T$ for time):\n$$ T^1 = (M L^{-1} T^{\\alpha-2})^x (M L^{-1} T^{-2})^y $$\n$$ M^0 L^0 T^1 = M^{x+y} L^{-x-y} T^{x(\\alpha-2) - 2y} $$\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension gives a system of linear equations:\n1. For mass ($M$): $x + y = 0 \\implies y = -x$\n2. For length ($L$): $-x - y = 0 \\implies y = -x$ (This is consistent with the mass equation)\n3. For time ($T$): $x(\\alpha-2) - 2y = 1$\n\nSubstituting $y = -x$ into the time-exponent equation:\n$$ x(\\alpha-2) - 2(-x) = 1 $$\n$$ x\\alpha - 2x + 2x = 1 $$\n$$ x\\alpha = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} $$\nConsequently, $y = -x = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha}$.\nThus, the timescale $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ must be proportional to $\\eta_{\\alpha}^{1/\\alpha} E^{-1/\\alpha}$. We can define the characteristic viscoelastic timescale as:\n$$ \\tau_{\\alpha} = \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{\\alpha}}{E}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} $$\nTo verify the units, we check the dimensions of the ratio $\\eta_{\\alpha}/E$:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{\\eta_{\\alpha}}{E}\\right] = \\frac{\\mathrm{Pa} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{\\alpha}}{\\mathrm{Pa}} = \\mathrm{s}^{\\alpha} = T^{\\alpha} $$\nTherefore, the units of $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ are:\n$$ [\\tau_{\\alpha}] = \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\eta_{\\alpha}}{E}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} \\right] = (T^{\\alpha})^{1/\\alpha} = T^1 $$\nThe resulting quantity has units of time (seconds), confirming its validity as a timescale.\n\n**2.

We solve for the steady-state strain response $\\varepsilon(t)$ by working in the frequency domain, a method justified by the principle of linear superposition.

Let $\\hat{\\sigma}(\\omega)$ and $\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega)$ denote the FT of $\\sigma(t)$ and $\\varepsilon(t)$, respectively.\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\{\\sigma(t)\\} = \\mathcal{F}\\{E \\varepsilon(t) + \\eta_{\\alpha} D_t^{\\alpha}\\varepsilon(t)\\} $$\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(\\omega) = E \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) + \\eta_{\\alpha} \\mathcal{F}\\{D_t^{\\alpha}\\varepsilon(t)\\} $$\nUsing the provided FT property for the Caputo fractional derivative, $\\mathcal{F}\\{D_t^{\\alpha}\\varepsilon(t)\\} = (i\\omega)^{\\alpha} \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega)$, we get:\n$$ \\hat{\\sigma}(\\omega) = E \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) + \\eta_{\\alpha} (i\\omega)^{\\alpha} \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) = [E + \\eta_{\\alpha}(i\\omega)^{\\alpha}] \\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega) $$\nThis equation defines the complex modulus, $E^*(\\omega)$, which relates the stress and strain phasors in the frequency domain:\n$$ E^*(\\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}(\\omega)}{\\hat{\\varepsilon}(\\omega)} = E + \\eta_{\\alpha}(i\\omega)^{\\alpha} $$\nFor a harmonic input, we can work with complex amplitudes. Representing the stress as $\\sigma(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\sigma_0 e^{i\\omega t}\\}$, the steady-state strain will have the form $\\varepsilon(t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\varepsilon_{complex} e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. The relationship between complex amplitudes is $\\sigma_0 = E^*(\\omega) \\varepsilon_{complex}$. Thus, the complex strain amplitude is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{complex} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E^*(\\omega)} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{E + \\eta_{\\alpha}(i\\omega)^{\\alpha}} $$\nTo evaluate this expression, we first analyze the term $(i\\omega)^{\\alpha}$. Using polar representation for the complex number $i = e^{i\\pi/2}$:\n$$ (i\\omega)^{\\alpha} = (\\omega e^{i\\pi/2})^{\\alpha} = \\omega^{\\alpha} (e^{i\\pi/2})^{\\alpha} = \\omega^{\\alpha} e^{i\\alpha\\pi/2} $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos(\\theta) + i\\sin(\\theta)$, this becomes:\n$$ (i\\omega)^{\\alpha} = \\omega^{\\alpha} \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $E^*(\\omega)$:\n$$ E^*(\\omega) = E + \\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha} \\left( \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) + i\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) $$\nWe can identify the real and imaginary parts of $E^*(\\omega) = E'(\\omega) + iE''(\\omega)$:\n- Real part (storage modulus): $E'(\\omega) = E + \\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)$\n- Imaginary part (loss modulus): $E''(\\omega) = \\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)$\n\nThe steady-state strain amplitude $|\\varepsilon|$ is the magnitude of the complex amplitude $\\varepsilon_{complex}$:\n$$ |\\varepsilon| = |\\varepsilon_{complex}| = \\left|\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E^*(\\omega)}\\right| = \\frac{|\\sigma_0|}{|E^*(\\omega)|} = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{(E'(\\omega))^2 + (E''(\\omega))^2}} $$\n$$ |\\varepsilon| = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{\\left(E + \\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right)^2}} $$\nExpanding the terms under the square root:\n$$ |\\varepsilon| = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{E^2 + 2E\\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\eta_{\\alpha}^2\\omega^{2\\alpha}\\cos^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\eta_{\\alpha}^2\\omega^{2\\alpha}\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)}} $$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2\\theta + \\sin^2\\theta = 1$:\n$$ |\\varepsilon| = \\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sqrt{E^2 + 2E\\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\eta_{\\alpha}^2\\omega^{2\\alpha}}} $$\nThe strain phase $\\phi$ relative to the stress is the argument of $\\varepsilon_{complex}$:\n$$ \\phi = \\arg(\\varepsilon_{complex}) = \\arg\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_0}{E^*(\\omega)}\\right) = \\arg(\\sigma_0) - \\arg(E^*(\\omega)) $$\nSince $\\sigma_0$ is a real, positive amplitude, its argument is $0$. Therefore, the phase of the strain is the negative of the phase of the complex modulus:\n$$ \\phi = -\\arg(E^*(\\omega)) = -\\mathrm{atan2}(E''(\\omega), E'(\\omega)) $$\n$$ \\phi = -\\mathrm{arctan}\\left(\\frac{\\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)}{E + \\eta_{\\alpha}\\omega^{\\alpha}\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\alpha\\pi}{2}\\right)}\\right) $$\nSince $0 < \\alpha < 1$, both $E'(\\omega)-E$ and $E''(\\omega)$ are positive, so $\\arg(E^*(\\omega))$ is in the first quadrant, and the phase lag $\\phi$ is negative, indicating that the strain lags the stress, as expected for a viscoelastic material.\n\n**4. Computational Implementation**\n\nThe derived formulas are implemented in a Python program. For each of the $5$ test cases defined by the tuple $(E, L, D, \\alpha, f, \\sigma_0)$, the program executes the following steps:\n1.  Calculates the fractional viscous coefficient $\\eta_{\\alpha}$ using the scaling law: $\\eta_{\\alpha} = E (L^2/D)^{\\alpha}$.\n2.  Calculates the angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.\n3.  Computes the strain amplitude $|\\varepsilon|$ and phase $\\phi$ using the expressions derived in part 3.\n4.  The NumPy library is used for mathematical constants ($\\pi$) and functions (`sqrt`, `cos`, `sin`, `power`, `arctan2`).\n5.  The results for all test cases are collected and formatted into a single string as specified.",
