You intend to integrate this ODE numerically using the explicit Euler method with a uniform time step $h  0$. Starting strictly from the definition of the explicit Euler method applied to a scalar linear dynamical system and fundamental notions of stability, derive a condition on the time step $h$ that ensures the numerical solution decays in magnitude asymptotically whenever the continuous-time system is asymptotically stable, i.e., when $a$ is a negative constant.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the stability condition for the explicit Euler method applied to a linear first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), first for a constant coefficient and then for a time-varying coefficient. Finally, this condition must be applied to a specific case involving a periodic coefficient to find the maximum stable uniform time step.\n\nLet's begin by analyzing the general scalar linear ODE:\n$$\n\\dot{x}(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = a(t)x(t)\n$$\nThe explicit Euler method approximates the solution at discrete time steps $t_n = n h$, where $h$ is the time step, by using the first-order Taylor expansion:\n$$\nx(t_{n+1}) \\approx x(t_n) + h \\dot{x}(t_n)\n$$\nDenoting the numerical approximation of $x(t_n)$ as $x_n$, the update rule becomes:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_n + h f(t_n, x_n)\n$$\nFor the given ODE, $f(t_n, x_n) = a(t_n)x_n$. Thus, the explicit Euler scheme is:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = x_n + h a(t_n) x_n = (1 + h a(t_n)) x_n\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Constant Coefficient Case**\nFirst, consider the case where $a(t) = a$ is a negative constant. The continuous system is $\\dot{x} = ax$, which has the solution $x(t) = x(0) \\exp(at)$. Since $a  0$, the solution is asymptotically stable, meaning $x(t) \\to 0$ as $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nThe numerical scheme becomes:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = (1 + h a) x_n\n$$\nFor the numerical solution to also be asymptotically stable, its magnitude must decay at each step, i.e., $|x_{n+1}|  |x_n|$ for $x_n \\neq 0$. This requires the magnitude of the amplification factor, $G = \\frac{x_{n+1}}{x_n} = 1 + h a$, to be strictly less than $1$:\n$$\n|G|  1 \\implies |1 + h a|  1\n$$\nThis inequality can be expanded as:\n$$\n-1  1 + h a  1\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the inequality, $1 + h a  1$, simplifies to $h a  0$. Since we are given $h  0$ and $a  0$, this condition is always satisfied.\nThe left-hand side of the inequality, $-1  1 + h a$, provides the critical stability constraint:\n$$\n-2  h a\n$$\nSince $a$ is negative, dividing by $a$ reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\nh  -\\frac{2}{a}\n$$\nSince $a0$, $-a = |a|$, so the condition can also be written as $h  \\frac{2}{|a|}$. This is the condition on the time step $h$ that ensures the numerical solution for the constant-coefficient system decays asymptotically.\n\n**Part 2: Time-Varying Coefficient Case**\nNow, let's extend the analysis to the case where $a(t)$ is\ntime-varying but always negative ($a(t)  0$ for all $t$). The Euler update rule at step $n$ is:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = (1 + h a(t_n)) x_n\n$$\nThe amplification factor at this step is $G_n = 1 + h a(t_n)$. For the numerical solution's magnitude to decay monotonically, we require $|G_n|  1$ at every step $n$.\n$$\n|1 + h a(t_n)|  1\n$$\nAs before, since $h  0$ and $a(t_n)  0$, the condition $1 + h a(t_n)  1$ is always met. The non-trivial constraint comes from $1 + h a(t_n)  -1$, which yields:\n$$\nh a(t_n)  -2 \\implies h  -\\frac{2}{a(t_n)}\n$$\nThis result allows for two scenarios for step size selection:\n\n1.  **Time-varying step sequence $\\{h_n\\}$**: One can adapt the step size at each iteration. The stability condition is simply $h_n  -\\frac{2}{a(t_n)}$. This allows for larger steps when $|a(t_n)|$ is small and forces smaller steps when $|a(t_n)|$ is large.\n\n2.  **Uniform step size $h$**: If a constant step size $h$ is used for the entire integration interval, it must satisfy the stability constraint for all possible values of $a(t)$ encountered. This means $h$ must be smaller than the minimum possible value of the bound $-\\frac{2}{a(t)}$.\n    $$\n    h  \\min_{t} \\left(-\\frac{2}{a(t)}\\right)\n    $$\n    Since $a(t)$ is negative, minimizing $-\\frac{2}{a(t)}$ is equivalent to finding the value of $t$ that makes $a(t)$ as negative as possible, i.e., finding the minimum of $a(t)$ over the interval. Let $a_{\\min} = \\min_{t} a(t)$. The condition for a uniform step size becomes:\n    $$\n    h  -\\frac{2}{a_{\\min}} = \\frac{2}{-a_{\\min}} = \\frac{2}{\\max_{t} |a(t)|}\n    $$\n    This ensures stability for the \"stiffest\" part of the system dynamics, where the rate of change is most rapid.\n\n**Part 3: Specific Case and Calculation**\nThe problem provides a specific model for the elimination rate:\n$$\na(t) = -\\big(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\omega t)\\big)\n$$\nwith parameters $\\alpha = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\beta = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $\\omega = 5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. We need to find the largest uniform step size $h_{\\max}$ that guarantees stability over the time interval $t \\in [0, 10]\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFollowing the derivation for a uniform step size, we must satisfy the condition $h  2 / \\max_{t \\in [0,10]} |a(t)|$.\nLet's find the maximum value of $|a(t)|$ on the specified interval.\n$$\n|a(t)| = |-\\big(\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\omega t)\\big)| = \\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe condition $\\alpha > \\beta > 0$ ensures that $\\alpha + \\beta \\cos(\\omega t)$ is always positive, so the absolute value is straightforward.\n\nTo maximize this function, we need to maximize the term $\\cos(\\omega t)$. The maximum value of the cosine function is $1$. This occurs when its argument is an integer multiple of $2\\pi$, i.e., $\\omega t = 2k\\pi$ for $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\nWe must check if such a $t$ exists in the interval $[0, 10]\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nWith $\\omega = 5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, this means $5t = 2k\\pi$, or $t = \\frac{2k\\pi}{5}$.\nFor $k=0$, $t=0$, which is in the interval. Thus, the maximum value is attained.\n\nThe maximum value of $|a(t)|$ is:\n$$\n\\max_{t \\in [0,10]} |a(t)| = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot \\max_{t \\in [0,10]} (\\cos(\\omega t)) = \\alpha + \\beta \\cdot 1 = \\alpha + \\beta\n$$\nThe stability condition for a uniform step size $h$ is therefore:\n$$\nh  \\frac{2}{\\alpha + \\beta}\n$$\nThe largest uniform step size, $h_{\\max}$, is the supremum of this range:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{\\alpha + \\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $\\alpha = 1.7\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\beta = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{1.7 + 0.2} = \\frac{2}{1.9}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\frac{2}{1.9} \\approx 1.05263157... \\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $1.053\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",

It presents a standard exercise in the numerical analysis of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), specifically addressing the stability of the forward Euler method when applied to a linear oscillatory system. All provided information is self-contained and sufficient for deriving a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the discrete amplitude amplification factor, $g(\\omega,h)$, for the forward Euler method applied to a scalar complex ODE representing an oscillatory eigenmode.\n\nThe forward Euler method provides a discrete approximation to the solution of a first-order ODE of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} = f(t,y)$. The update rule for a step size $h$ is given by:\n$$\ny_{n+1} = y_n + h f(t_n, y_n)\n$$\nwhere $y_n$ is the numerical approximation of the solution $y(t)$ at time $t_n = t_0 + nh$.\n\nIn this problem, the specific ODE for the eigenmode is given as $\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\lambda y$, with the eigenvalue $\\lambda = i \\omega$. Here, $\\omega  0$ is the angular frequency and $i$ is the imaginary unit, $i^2 = -1$.

In our case, the complex multiplier is $z = 1 + i(\\omega h)$. The real part is $a = 1$ and the imaginary part is $b = \\omega h$.\n\nTherefore, the amplification factor is:\n$$\ng(\\omega,h) = \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\omega h)^2}\n$$\n$$\ng(\\omega,h) = \\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2 h^2}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the amplification factor.\n\nFor the qualitative analysis, we examine the value of $g(\\omega,h)$. The problem specifies that $\\omega  0$ and the time step $h  0$. Consequently, the product $\\omega h$ is a positive real number, and its square, $\\omega^2 h^2$, is also strictly positive.\nThis means that $1 + \\omega^2 h^2  1$.\nTaking the square root, we find that $g(\\omega,h) = \\sqrt{1 + \\omega^2 h^2}  \\sqrt{1} = 1$.\n\nThe amplitude of the numerical solution at step $n+1$, denoted as $A_{n+1} = |y_{n+1}|$, is related to the amplitude at step $n$, $A_n = |y_n|$, by:\n$$\nA_{n+1} = |y_{n+1}| = |(1 + i \\omega h) y_n| = |1 + i \\omega h| |y_n| = g(\\omega,h) A_n\n$$\nSince $g(\\omega,h)  1$ for any $h  0$, the amplitude is multiplied by a factor greater than one at every time step. Starting with an initial amplitude $A_0 = |y_0|$, the amplitude after $N$ steps will be:\n$$\nA_N = (g(\\omega,h))^N A_0\n$$\nBecause $g(\\omega,h)  1$, the term $(g(\\omega,h))^N$ grows exponentially as the number of steps $N$ increases. This means the numerical solution will exhibit an unphysical, exponentially increasing amplitude. The true analytical solution to $\\frac{dy}{dt} = i \\omega y$ is $y(t) = y_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)$, which has a constant amplitude $|y(t)| = |y_0| |\\exp(i\\omega t)| = |y_0|$. The forward Euler method is therefore numerically unstable for this purely oscillatory system, regardless of the choice of step size $h$, as it systematically injects energy into the system at each step, causing the amplitude to diverge.",
